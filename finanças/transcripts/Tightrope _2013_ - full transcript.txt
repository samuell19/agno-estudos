Tightrope Shit! You OK? Slowly! Fuck! Dammit! Oh, calm down! Keep going. Slowly. You have to know how, man. You want to be a guide? Climb? You have to calm down. We can quit if you want. No! OK, climb. Let's go. OK. No reason to get mad. Jerk! OK? Yeah. - Do we keep going? - Yeah. OK. You're sure you don't want to come with us? It's over, girl, we're out. Eh? Take care, OK? No funny business. - Swear to me? - I swear. I've gotta go. Be careful, probation's no joke. Huh? 7 years in prison, that's a lot. National Police Can I help you? - I'm looking for the PO. - "PO"? Probation office. I know, we don't have that here. See Captain Labbe. Last door on the right. Sandra Devalliere, Romainville. - That's me. - OK. I have you. Let's see. 7 years? What did you do to get so much, so young? OK. I'll follow up on your file. I'm warning you, we don't need girls like you here. Look at me! Mess up and you're back in jail. Same goes if you miss an appointment. Got it? Got it? Got it. Is the address still correct? With Paul... Paul Devalliere. The climber? Are you his daughter? - I usually get up early. - "Early"? It's not early, it's the crack of dawn. Coffee? I might have tea, if you want. Sandra? You know my name? Sandra, Mathilde, Jeanne Devalliere, Sept. 6, 89 11:15pm Romainville, Seine-Saint-Denis. Mom died. Do you have any toast? Breakfast is over. I won't be in your hair long. - Where are you going? - Into town, for work. I'm going to leave this shack fast! - You haven't done anything. - I was finding my way. So many years? There's nothing after highschool. I was thinking. I know 5 years is a long time to think. Did I waste my time? I'll think about it. When did it happen, your mom's passing? I was 16. 7 years ago? What have you been doing, all this time? Did you study? Finish high school? Did you stay in Paris? Your mom's boyfriend, Marc, is he still... Are you a cop? I'm not telling you. You had to be there. What's that building? Nothing. An old sheep pen. I can stay there, until I get a job. Getting up and sleeping early isn't my thing. What happened to her? To your mom ? Was she sick? Did she suffer? - Did she ever talk about me? - Never. I stopped asking questions the day she gave me your photo with your address on the back. I was a kid. I've managed quite well without you for 23 years. Hi. I forgot we were training today. - My daughter. - Your daughter. OK. See you Sunday, then? Unless you forgot about my birthday. Go, go, go, go, go! Happy birthday, sweetie. - Champagne. - Happy birthday, honey. - Here. - Thanks, Paul. - Happy birthday. - Oh! That must be Dad! Sorry, I got held up at the station. Hi, everyone. So, the heroes of the day... How are you? - Happy birthday. - Thanks. - How are you? - Good. Here, Jean. I have to introduce you. Sandra, Paul's daughter. Are you staying around here? I'm looking for work. - It's nice here. - What are you looking for? Did you go to school? Do you have brothers or sisters? - How old are you? - Almost like Raphaelle and Bruno? - They've been together for 10 years. - We're not grandmas yet. - Mom! I knew your mom. Paul told us. So sad! Dying so young! What happened? Sickness? Accident? Excuse me. Poor girl. - Do you know the cop? - Jean? Everyone knows him in the valley. We climbed up together. Why? Have you ever climbed to the top? I've climbed around the world. But here... It's my back yard. Is it high? Bruno's plan, for example, is a path I opened... 10 years ago... He wants to do it in the winter, it's a first. Is it more dangerous? It's harder. People think climbing the mountain is about pride, but it's the opposite. OK. It fits like a glove. - You, too. - Really? You think? You're having a laugh. Only girls hear that kind of shit. For once... You've got nerve. A pretty girl needs that. 3/4 of the customers are men, especially at night. I can dress myself, thanks. I'll show you the pumps. - You come this way... - Enough! Stop! Or what? That's true. Or what? Whatcha gonna do? You've got nerve. I like that, yeah. You like that? Head butting! This won't do. You're lucky he dropped it. Should I just let him molest me? After women's prison you don't swing that way. Dick! A nice cashmere sweater. How nice to learn that you have a daughter from someone else. I need you, Agnes. I don't know what to do with her, we're... We're like oil and water. She can't find a job. Does your mom still need someone to help her? You realize what you're asking? I want to try. - It's not for beginners. - Good. Wait. Come down. Put this on. OK. Enough for me. - Does your shoulder still hurt? - Yes. It's annoying. Bye. Careful, careful. I want to learn about the real mountain. The mountain isn't easy. You were gone when I was a baby. You didn't teach me to ride a bike or do the times table. You never taught me anything. You want to learn about the mountain? Start by getting up early. To think, there are idiots sleeping in when they could freeze their asses off on the mountain. - Look. - What? Over there. Where? He moved. Come on. - Give me your hand. - Hold on I'm stuck. Put your foot on the block. On the block. - There. OK? - Yeah. No... It's OK, it's OK, it's OK. Take a break. - No need. I'm OK. - I need it. Why did you come? After all this time. OK, let's go. Unless you still need to rest. - Let's go. - OK, go. Take it slow. Steady. Don't go fast, you need endurance. Have you always lived alone since Mom left? Was there anyone else? My parents always ran the snack bar together. They lived there. More than at home. 2 years ago they had a car accident. Dad was driving, Mom was in the passenger seat. She lived, he didn't. Since then, she's refused any help. You'll see, she's not easy. It's sink or swim with her. That works. You look so much like your mom at that age. Sorry, it's been a while. Do you want anything? OK. Here. This is to feed us. Thanks. Have you finished? Yes, but we'd like a drop more. Coming right up. - What do they want? - Nothing. Perfect. Very good. I'm coming back. Right away. Has she worked before? You need to be smart with the customers. This job is much more than carrying a tray. I've got regulars. Yes. It's hospitality, sincerity. You cannot improvise. OK. But you could try at least. Can she make sandwiches? Salads? Mulled wine? There it is. It's delicate. Have some, quick. Oh, it's hot! - Coming up. - Thanks. - Are you going? - Bye. OK. Come again! We'll save time together. Service, chatting with tables, smiling at them, I'll do it. Working with you, not so sure. When I'm the subject of conversation, I like to be looked in the eye. I like you. You're dressed like a bum, but I like you. We can try if you want. Tomorrow. 10:00. I like punctuality. Your mom and Agnes, my daughter were in love with your dad... But he was crazy about Valerie, your mom. He never really got over her leaving. So like all climbers, they're emotionally unavailable, what did he do? He picked... He picked... running to the highest mountains on earth. What can I say? It's... They're all... What are you doing? You're still scrubbing. OK, but I could do it better. Scrub harder, and in the same direction. And sing. Sing. Whistle while you work... Want to dance? Want to dance?... I'll teach you to live. We were getting to know each other. It's OK. Relax. I wasn't going to talk about jail. We met in high school. And Fred? Well... He had other girls. You need details? I had nowhere to go. You did the right thing. I'm glad. Let's drink! To us! - To the future. - Fuck the past. Can we buy you a drink? Why not? That looks pretty on you. - Stop, you're bothering me. - You, too. Come, Marie. - Come! - You're not my mom. - Let us go! - Don't touch me! Calm down. Or I'll call the cops. - Drop it. - Let me go. - Let's go. - Scram! Are you dumb? - My wallet. - I didn't do anything. You bitch! My wallet! Watch out, Marie, fuck! We lost those bastards. Are you serious? - Damn, bingo! - Are you fucking kidding? Oh no! You're insane! No... No, no, no, no! Sandra! Sorry, I'm late... Maybe we can... Too late. You didn't show up. But I'm here. Please. Please. Take it up with your PO. The cute one is training as a guide. A real champion. He always has the same thing. Orange, lemonade and grenadine zest. She always has a dry martini with 2 olives. She's number 2 for a chain of a ski and climbing stores. It's going international. Imagine. Beautiful, but she can't be dumb, she's got an important job for being so young. Yes, yes. Go. Come on! Faster! Come on! I'm gonna go. - Hi. - Hello! The boss. Let me introduce... We know her. - I was at Bruno's birthday. - With Paul. But we saw each other since. I mean, I did. At the station. - Not enough grenadine here. - It's OK. Oh, no... Not enough. Yes, it's OK. No, it's on the bottom. OK, let's go, start it. Faster, faster! Marie! - Bye! - Marie, wait, wait. Alexandre Prevost. From the Probation Office, the PO. Hi. I'm the officer for Ms. Sandra Devalliere. I have to verify the address. Is she staying with you? Yes, she is. Follow me. I'm really a city girl, really. Without my husband I still would be. What we do for love! In 40 years, I've never left this view. - You didn't tell me, Ma'am. - Mireille. Please, despite the age difference. Yes? You didn't tell me what happened with my dad and Agnes, after my mom left. They were together for a long time. Your dad lived alone in his house, but they were really together. It lasted years. But they got older, your dad wouldn't commit. And Agnes wanted a baby. That was the end. I really like your father... I rather... I admire him. I admire the champion. But... My husband and I wanted grandchildren, and for Agnes to have a baby. They were made for each other. Agnes waited. What a waste! Can you imagine a brother or sister? Oh, no! I'd better go. Oh, wait,... I copied the keys for you. There's the door, the pantry, and the register. Thank you. How long were you in prison? Don't bother lying, your TO or whatever came. Then you know. Why didn't you tell me? Marie isn't from school. What did you do to get 7 years? He didn't tell me. Confidentiality. 7 years, as a minor! More, because you're on parole. I have the right to know who my daughter is. You? You've never been interested! What do you know? What do you know about me, your mom, your birth? What do you know? You have no right to judge! Your mom left me when she was pregnant. I came home one night, she was gone, no note, nothing. I was 24, I loved her. I'd already picked your name. Sandra. Like my mother. She met that guy at a party. I was up there, of course. Always stuck up there. And your mother... she hated the mountain, or me being on it. And there was that... manipulative, dominating Marc. Under her skin. She was possessed. I tried to find her. I tried again when you were born. I calculated when. I went to every maternity ward in the area. I found the one. You were born 3 days before. But the address she left was fake. I went to City Hall. The hospital declared your birth. I acknowledged paternity, I signed. I signed the papers. I never heard from you again, or your mother. Never. - You're feeling it. - It doesn't hurt anymore... but it's like I'm afraid of it hurting. It's normal, after dislocating it. It'll be a few weeks before the risk is gone. - It's annoying. - Yeah. And it gives Raphaelle an argument. She's throwing fits. She says if I loved her I'd quit the climb. - She doesn't want to understand. - She can't. It's not that she doesn't want to. She can't. No one can. Especially a woman in love. And understand what? We like suffering, up here, in the middle of nowhere? When you realize your life isn't up here anymore, and down there is what counts, it means it's time to stop. - Oh, Nico! - But yes, it's better. Isn't it better since she put cinnamon in it? - Excuse me. - Mimi! And us? Give me that. Look. There's a table for you. Get to work! We can't make the customers wait. Go ahead. The only thing I care about today is that who you are, that you're there. If you want... If you feel like it... we could go up the mountain together. Climbing this time. Really climbing. Yes, I'd like that. Yes. Is K2 for next year? It's still only a plan. When was your last expedition? 2009, Mount McKinley, Alaska, 6,197 m. Are you updating your wardrobe, Paul? For my daughter. Ah... The climbing bug isn't just from father to son. Would Bruno take as many risks if his dad hadn't died on the mountain? - He's careful. He's prepared. So was his dad. You'll lose him if you won't let him be himself. He's a free man. The first gift you've given me. Soon you'll have the 2nd. You need a cell phone. Go down the harness. Sit. Let go. You'll feel it. OK. Let go. Push on your legs. OK. Let yourself go back. Good. Open your stance. OK. - OK? - Yes. OK, go down. I have you. Good. OK, let go. Great! That's called a friend. It's like a piston. You see? There are different sizes for the crack sizes. You put it in, let go. It holds. You take the rope put it in the carabiner. OK? OK. Good. Easy. Hold firm. Watch your left foot. Yes! Yes. Right foot. Great. Look. It's Agnes and your dad. A long time ago! I know that. Here's one for you. Is it my mom? She was 21, 22 there. I've gotta go. - Where? - A date. You don't know him. You can go, too. Don't worry, I'll close up. Don't worry, I'll take the last train. - OK, go. - Thanks. - Have a good practice! - Thanks. It's true what your dad says. It's in your blood. Don't worry. Get back up. So you don't let the fear get over you. Come on. There. You learn fast. I saw you, the other day - When? When you hid watching me. I thought you were working the register. Great. Seriously, have you done this before? No. - Yes you have. - No. Come here, against the wall. You've never done it? I thought you were quitting. I'll quit when I'm pregnant. You know I'm not ready. Raphaelle... We're young. You have your whole life to be a mother. It's not being a mother, it's giving you a child. I feel so much love for you it's suffocating. I don't have the words. There aren't any. So a child... I'm coming back. Don't lie, Bruno. I saw you climbing with Sandra. - Are you spying? - No. I was going to surprise you, like I used to do before. - "Before" what ? - Before you go. - You only care about the mountain. - That's not true. I'm going to be a guide. The mountain is a passion, but it's not you or it. At least not for me. I don't want to choose. I don't have to. I'm working hard, training for the climb because I have to do it. - It's important. - It's crazy! All you think about is danger, but there's more to it. I don't know, it's so... If you came with me, you would get it. But I'm with you here, now, talking to you. You're the one who's not here. And it's worse since that girl showed up. That's ridiculous. I'm just saying I love you, I want a baby with you. Don't you think you're worrying too much? I don't know, Mom. It's hard to explain. I just feel it. Like a ball inside of me getting bigger every day. It's suffocating. Ah! Meeting at the top? OK. I'm going. We have a meeting, too. - Dad. - Yes? Sandra, Paul's daughter, why was she at the station the other day? What happens at the station... "...stays at the station." Yes. OK. They're waiting. Say hi to Bruno. That was fast. What happened? Thanks, Nicolas. I'll see you in the car. What happened? She overdosed. A real walking pharmacy, she could have died. But she made it. Given Sandra's situation, it's better no one knows. especially the police. She can recover quietly here. So what do I do? Let her rest, give her food, only if she wants. Have her drink. I'll come by tomorrow, I think she'll be fine. She's young. She'll be up in 2 days. Thanks. For Sandra. How's it going with her? Better. Good. She likes it with your mom. She's liking the valley. And you? What about me? With her? As a father? Do you like it? I'm sure you do, I never doubted it. What's going on? Marie has to leave as soon as possible. - But... - No buts. It's my house, you're my daughter. No buts! That asshole! I had enough for 3,000! You really can't stay, Marie. It's too dangerous. Get it? I get it. You've got a short memory. - No! I haven't forgotten. - We'll see. Fuck it. I'm leaving this shit hole! I'll disappear from your life. But I need dough. I don't have any. Yes you do, wads of it every day. Are you sick? And my probation? You owe me. No... No! Not Mireille. I can't rob Mireille. If you don't pay me back I'll tell them you're a murderer. You wouldn't. Not you, Marie. Not you. It's Fred. What, "Fred"? I owe him some dough, a lot. He'll bump me off if I don't pay him back. OK. You're right, you don't have to help me. I won't forget. Me either. I never forget. Ever. Be careful. Stop messing around. You, too! And come on, with Bruno. It's so obvious. Your dad's in Chamonix. He asked me to fill in. Are we going? OK. Was it Marie? Coincidentally she left the next day. - The ski patrol saw Sandra. With or without Marie, I don't care. - How much? I'll pay you back. - It's not about money. Sandra could end up behind bars again. You think I'm going to file a complaint? Who do you think I am? I never want to hear about your daughter again. OK? She needs the job and other people's trust. - I trust her. - I know. I understand how you feel. But give her a 2nd chance, she'll think about it. She'll realize there's tolerance and understanding. You taught me that. I trusted her! Thanks for trying. For defending my daughter. No, stop. No need. It wasn't for you. I don't know Sandra well but there's something I like about her. I thought I'd made headway. It'll be OK. You just need time. I don't know who she is. I know nothing about my daughter. Why did she served so much time in jail? 7 years! As a minor. What could she have done? I've imagined everything. How do you bounce back after that? Start over and believe? With your help. Isn't it why she's here? That's why she came. I feel like I missed a part of my life. You've missed a lot of things, for sure. But it's never too late. Well... not for everything. It's not too late, Paul. OK. Get me down. - Get me down! - No. Yes! I want to get down, dammit! We're going up. No way down! - I want to go down! - Trust me. No. Screw you. Get me down! Fuck! Fucking trust me! Without trust you can't do anything up here. You've done the worst part. There. OK. Great. Give me your hand. OK. There. Up! There. A little more. The refuge is behind there. We're almost there. Why do you want to do it in the winter? To be stronger, harder? Beat my dad... or yours. - Mine died when I was 3. You didn't have time. - For what? - To know him. That's right, dads are your specialty. How long have you known yours? Wait! Sandra, wait! Wait! Calm down! It's OK. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. It's OK. Go away! - Calm down. - Go away! - Go away! - Please calm down. - Go away! - Please, calm down. Calm down. I'm sorry. Where were you? - I left 10 messages. - It's not your business. Is Mireille's money my business? I trusted you. My friends trusted you. Because you're my daughter. You don't know who your daughter is! No, but I can listen. I don't know about you, but you're still my daughter. You hear me? Go see Mireille. - No, I won't. - Yes, for respect for her. And me. And you above all. You have to take responsibility. I don't believe it. You're telling me this? You've spent your life fleeing. Fleeing love, the baby Agnes wanted, alone in this shit hole of a house! Come on in. How are you? I'm glad to see you. - Do you want some coffee? - No, thanks. Sorry to bother you. No problem. I'm talking to you my friend, not the cop. I need to know why my daughter was in prison. Her stepfather, Marc... - Marc Payet. She killed him. Raphaelle? It's me. The money was for Marie. In prison, I only had her. She saved me. Without her, I... She found me just in time. Don't forgive me. I'm just explaining. What? Take that back, get to work! We're busy today, very busy! Sandra isn't working today. - I'm not looking for her. - We'll see. Stop playing cat and mouse. I know I am very nosey, but that's part of my charm. Raphaelle is great, she's perfect. You'll have kids, but she's not for you. And you're not for her. Don't let Sandra go. I can't stop thinking about you. When you ran away and you were afraid of me, when... when you fell asleep in my arms... I don't want you to be afraid, Sandra. Never again. Oh, my love. Hi. Oh, no, no. No more alcohol for me. Just some juice. Anything. And get something for you. I'm celebrating. I'm expecting. Ah, Sandra. I almost missed you. Go away! Never talk to me again. What's going on? You're like all the others. Like all men, who've just been full of shit. Sandra, wait! I don't understand, what's going on? How could you? Could I what? Fuck me when Raphaelle is pregnant with your baby? Sandra! Why won't you call back? Please, Bruno, I'm begging you, I'm worried. Call me back... Where were you? You're froze. - What are you doing? - How could you do that? - Trap me. - Let me explain. No, no. There's nothing to explain. I find out you're pregnant from Sandra. Why? Why would you tell her? - Why? - So she knows. - What? - You're mine. - You're mine, my love. - I'm not yours. - Stop. - You get it? I'm not yours. Stop, Bruno. Stop. Stop! - That girl... - Shut up! - You know who she is? - Shut up! Your little Sandra is a jailbird. - Whatever. - She was in prison for murder! You're insane. I swear, baby. I swear. Bruno is mine. I forbid you from speaking to him. He won't leave you in your condition. He's not the type. He loves me, OK? - He doesn't have much choice. - Yes, he does. But he knows. He knows you killed. Did you lie? You're not pregnant? There you go. This time, you can go back to prison. Agnes, it's me. It's Paul. Listen... I want us to talk. I... I know I was wrong. To you, to us, but if you believe what you said, I think it's not too late, for everything. Call me back, please? Agnes, I... The police are gonna come for me. What do I do? What do I do? Start with the truth. Mum was shutting down. She never laughed. She looked older than my friends' moms. I realized he was hitting her when I was 7 or 8. He drank. He did drugs. Sometimes, he could be nice. And 2 hours later he'd come home in a rage. It happened on my 16th birthday. I came home from school. He died on the spot. Mom died from her injuries during the night. I wouldn't speak. I wouldn't defend myself. I wanted to pay the price. For not having saved my mum. Then I went to jail. He did it. The descent is the hard part. And this one is a hell of a drop. It was too soon. His shoulder is still bad. It could dislocate. Try calling him. - I can't leave him. - It won't go through. I know where he'll go down. I'm going. - I'm coming with you. - No. It's dangerous. - You'd slow me down. - He left because of me. It's Catherine. Raphaelle told me Bruno left with his gear. You think he went on the climb? Shit, God dammit! I have to go. You don't get it. I have to go. I have to. Bruno is up there. Staying here is like being in jail. Please, please... Don't leave me this time. Not this time, Dad. Come on. Don't look down. Hit the ice harder. One step after the other. Like that. Come on! OK. No, no. I'm afraid I wanna go down. You can't. Come on, like a cat! We have to go. - No. I'm afraid! - Get going! Paul opened the path 10 years ago. He's the best one to help Bruno. You'll see, it'll be OK between you. Your mom told me about your fight. It's nothing, just a fight. You'll come out stronger. - No. - Yes, you will. I know my son. I know climbers. You'll see. No, I've lost Bruno. What are you saying? you've been together for 10 years. Don't give up, you love him. Exactly. I love him. I want him to be happy. We're doing a rescue flight. Officially there's no disappearance. It'll all work out. Where are you going? - Hi, Fred. - Hello. I want to withdraw my complaint against Sandra Devalliere. Look! What's that? He must have gone down through here. We have to find him fast. It's really craggy. Without a rope is insane. Bruno! There are crevasses hidden under the snow. We'll cross with a tight rope. So we can steady each other. You can go. I'll steady you. Bruno! Here! Bruno! Watch out. Bruno! Here! Bruno! There! - Sandra! - This way. - Here! - It's him, Dad! It's him! Careful. It's dangerous. - Bruno! - In here! He's there. Sandra. Don't worry, we're here! Yes? Ah. OK. I'll call you back. Thanks. They found him in a crevasse. A broken arm, but he's OK. There they are. You did it, man. That's what counts. How are you, sweetie? OK, Mom. Don't worry. - I did it. - You did. See you soon. OK. You can go. It'll be better, now. Go on. I'm coming with you. I'm glad you're here. Almost there. Look. There. - We're there! - Right here! It's our peak! Come on. Sous-titrage : Eclair Group
