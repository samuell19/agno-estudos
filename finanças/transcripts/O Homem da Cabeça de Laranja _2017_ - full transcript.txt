"The clown is not I, but rather our monstrously cynical and... ...so naively unconscious society that plays at the game of being serious... ...the better to hide its own madness" - Salvador Dali Welcome to restaurant Reverie! Ready to order? Leave the bunnies alone. That's too much work. It's no work at all. It all depends on how you treat them. If I was to choose... I'd take the granny. The granny, Conrado? Those two cuties over there and... ...you pick the wrinkled old hag? Hot women are like watermelons. You never have them alone. What a cliche, huh? Cut the bullshit and get us something to eat. Hey jackass, can't you see us here? I know your kind. I don't want any trouble. He doesn't want any trouble, Walter. I heard him, Conrado. Do you think he knows we're here to talk to... The Swede? If he knew he would have chopped our heads off already. Our ego is going to be the death of us someday. I don't know why we always sit with our backs to the door. Wanna know why? Because nobody in the world is better than us, Conrado. Yeah, that's true. So make use of that truth and... ...show that idiot who's boss. What are doing there, jackass? I'm trimming my banana tree. Can't you see? Trimming my ass. Get us a menu or I'll show you what you can do with that banana. Goddamn Chinese restaurant. Japanese. Chinese, Japanese... It's all the same shit. It's no Italian. Have you ever seen anything good that wasn't made by Italians? French girls, Conrado. French girls. Shaved or hairy? French girls, shaved? It's the same as ordering hot fish in this restaurant. You like your fish raw, huh, you dirty bastard? "Me encanta el pescado" Go ahead and order something already, goddamnit. Hey, jackass, we wanna eat. Hello. What can I get you? Salmon, well done. We don't serve cooked salmon here, sir. Our chef is very strict about the customs of Oriental culinary. What did I tell you, Conrado? Customs. The specialty of the house. Customs my ass. Here we are in the middle of nowhere, in no man's land... ...and this moron wants to feel special. I bet this town doesn't even have a movie theater. You're absolutely right, sir. Unfortunately, there are no movie theaters in the vicinity. Can I ask him about the movies already? Conrado... Just get us something to drink. Buddy... We want a straight cachaça and another one with a twist of lemon. We don't serve cachaça, sir. Only sake. You'll find cachaça across the street. My dear friend. Do everyone here a favor. Go to the bar... and get us what we want. Bring us two shots of cachaça. Agreed. What's the matter with this guy? Xenocentrism. Even the peanuts are Japanese. You know... this reminds me of Goodfellas. The Martin Scorsese movie. Joe Pesci. What he did to that kid who was serving them. That kid got shot for a lot less than what this guy just did. But there's a difference. Pesci dies before the end of the film... ...because he kills people when he's not supposed to. Just let it roll. Who ordered the caipirinha? Caipirinha? Oh, that's a good one. He's gotta be joking. We ordered one straight and one with a twist of lemon. Perfect. Here you go... and here's your caipirinha. Conrado. Tell him... ...to get me a cachaça with a twist of lemon, please. Walter wants a cachaça with a twist of lemon. Get him what he wants, worm. We're out of cachaça, sir. I got you what you wanted. I'm not doing it again. You brought him caipirinha. Does anybody here look like a fag? Walter, are you a fag? Conrado... I'm definitely not a fag. Heard that? Walter is not a fag. Now get him a cachaça with a twist of lemon. We're out of lemons too, sir. Excuse me. Conrado... Go... and ask him about the two movies. Now. I love when it's time to talk about movies. You know, I like your style. - Yeah? - Yeah. Imagine that a movie theater is now open in this town. And two movies are showing. - Movie theater? - Yeah, a movie theater. The first movie is called "The Man With the Orange Head." And the other one is... "The Lovely Negotiation of the Dwarf Banana." - How cute. - Which one would you choose? - Me? - Yeah, you. Choose a movie. Or do you only watch Swedish films? Sit, Bruno. Just sit. Shit. Fuck. What the fuck do you want? Stop imagining things. There's too much weed in that tea of yours. What do you want? Say it already. We want you to choose a movie. Choose a movie. - Movie? - Yeah, a movie. What the hell for? Choose a movie. Banana or Orange? Which one do you pick? - You just want me to choose one? - Yeah. - Just choose. - Then you'll leave? Sure, sure. C'mon, pick a movie. - Choose one! - Say it again. "The Man With the Orange Head" or... "The Lovely Negotiation of the Dwarf Banana". "The Man With the Orange Head" or "The Lovely Negotiation of the Dwarf Banana". "The Man With the Orange Head" Perfect. Welcome to restaurant Reverie! My name is Rodrigo Veluto. I mean, I used to be Rodrigo Veluto, before this bullet to the head. Everybody used to call me Tomato. Everything was going well for me until this shit happened. Well... I was born in a small town and ever since I was a kid I always wanted to be a a ballet dancer... but on my first performance people started yelling "Little faggot! Little faggot!" So of course I gave up on that. Time went by and got into law school. Since that was the only thing left for me to do there. That's when I met Tomiko. Tomiko was this chubby Japanese nymphomaniac... who introduced me to the world of sex and drugs. We had a lot of fun together. We also lost all prospects of a decent future... ...so we moved to Japan looking for work. When we got there she got involved... ...with some shady nightclub people. I was chased out of town and she disappeared. I had to move to the country where I started working as an ass-wiper. You know, for sumo wrestlers? They're too large, they can't Wipe their own ass. They need someone to wipe their shit. Well, I saved some money and I went back to Tokyo, looking for Tomiko. I heard she was taken to Sweden by sex traffickers. I went after her. When I got there I found out that... Well... That's when I met this Swede... ...who helped me open this restaurant. I settled here and... ...since I always had a way with plants... ...I started growing some special ones just for him. We kept in touch and went into business together and... ...everything was going well. Until the day comes... ...when those two guys show up here looking for the Swede and... ...put a bullet in my head. You know, Walter... I don't know why nobody ever goes for the banana. Bananas make you fat, Conrado. C'mon, children. Let's move. Feel free to join our friends over there. That's nice. Just like cattle on a field. Don't talk to them like that, Conrado. You gotta respect the clients. Hitchcock used to call his actors cattle. They're not actors, Conrado. What you need to do is... ...explain the situation to them, ok? Why? Because we don't want a massacre to happen, Conrado. We are... Classy. Got it? Classy, not a couple of cavemen. Cavemen? You don't know what a caveman is? Alley-oop, from the comics? "Alley-oop, oop-oop-oop". That one I'd like to be. "Cuz he's a mean motah scootah... - ...and a bad go-gettah". - What are you doing, Conrado? Are you trying to embarrass us? And don't even think about... ...singing a "Balão Mágico" song, ok? Very well. We're here for the Swede. We're professionals... we assure you that no one will get hurt. - If you cooperate! - Right! With your cooperation no one will get hurt. Because we're professionals. - There will be no stray bullets. - No! There will be no stray bullets... ...because we're professionals. - And no unnecessary violence. - No unnecessary violence! We're professionals. I'm just telling them we're professionals. Well, it looks like you got the point... ...so here's what we'll do. Just to relax and unwind a little. Let's do it like in kindergarten. Each one of you will introduce yourselves any way you want it. One by one. Shall we? A bid you all welcome. Hi. My name is Abigail. I'm a senior at high school. I live with my nana. And my sister. I wake up... I have breakfast. I go to school. The school is very close to my house... ...near the condo. After class I go straight home. I don't usually have friends coming over to my house. I collect figurines. I have a lot of them. I have this one... ...that shows a family of bears. In painted plaster. Having a tea party around a table. I think it's the one I like the most. There's mama bear, papa bear and two little cubs. I stay at home most of the time. Monica doesn't like me to go out. Nana sometimes tells me to go to a friend's house or something. But not everybody lives in the condo. And it's kinda dangerous to go out. So I stay at home with Monica. I like to read. I read a lot, all kinds of books. The last one I really liked... ...was Love in the Time of Cholera... it's very romantic. I read all of the "Twilight" books. The one I'm reading now... ...I actually got from nana's nightstand. She can't know about it. It's "50 Shades of Grey". I like it. It's hot. My name is Monica. What else do you want? I'm Adelaide. Grandmother to Abigail and Monica. My dear granddaughters. I love them very much, but I also miss my privacy and sometimes... I get a little tired of them. Because I wanna go out. I wanna have fun. But I have the moral obligation of watching over them. I just enjoy life too much, you know? I'm in love with life. A lot of people say that life begins at forty... ...but to me life begins at seventy. My name is Conrado. And I've become a gangster. Sometimes I ask myself. If I ever did anything good with my life... Not you, Conrado. Do you think anybody here wants to hear what you have to say? Hi, I'm Aline. And I'm Bruno. I'm 35 years old. I'm also 35 years old. We've been married for five years... ...but we've been together for eleven. We met in college. Where I was majoring in engineering. And I was majoring in psychology. We were both accepted the same year. And we met each other that very same year. The first year of college. And we've been in this love story ever since, a very simple, lovely story. We spent all of our college years together, started a life together. We bought an apartment together... - ...it's a tiny place, but... - Planned ahead before doing anything... The furniture... And we always come to this restaurant. Always. We love it because it's very close to our place, so we're here at least once a week. - And the food is very good. - It is, isn't it? But we've been saving some money. So we haven't been going out a lot lately. We stay mostly at home, watching movies... ...and sometimes we go visit my mother. Sometimes we travel to this hotel on a farm. To spend the weekend, it's very nice. Oh, speaking about farms... ...may I tell that story? About the ranch? Go ahead. It isn't related to our marriage, it's something that happened to me when I was a child. I used to go to my aunt's ranch and this one day, I remember very vividly, I was five years old. There was this little dog that I loved that had to be put down. And on that day the caretaker took this shotgun and shot it right in front of me. The dog yelped and yelped and there I was watching the whole thing. Ever since I started therapy. How long has it been, Bru? It was the second or third year of college? - Seven years. - Only seven? For seven years I've been having this dream about that dog, the shooting. It's a dream that keeps haunting me and haunting me and I don't know what to do about it. Sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night, right, honey? - ...all sweaty, screaming... - Crying. It's horrible. Good evening, girls. Ma'am. - Good evening. - Good evening. If you want anything... ...just ask, alright? You're our guests. If you feel like going to the bathroom, go ahead. If you promise not to molest us. I assure you that nobody here will lay a hand on you. You just shoved your hand up my sister's skirt. Opportunity makes a thief, right? Grandma has let the two of you go out legs a-showin', so take the heat. Stop bothering the girls. They're free to wear whatever they want. I agree. You're right, ma'am. - What's your name again? - Adelaide. Baby... ...let grandma speak. Don't you think grandma knows her own name? Do you think she'll answer if I ask? So let her answer it, alright? So let her answer it, alright? So, granny... What's your name? - Adelaide. - Adelaide... Don't you think that your girls... ...give every guy that sees them a huge boner when they go out dressed like that? Talk to me. What year were you born, Adelaide? Look here, in my time, it was rude to ask for a woman's age, alright? And no one would go sticking their hands up the genitals of strangers. That's not what Nelson Rodrigues used to say. It wasn't. It sure wasn't. Say, grandma. Do you think society in your time consisted only of good men? - You have no idea. - What year were you married, granny? I married early in life. 1962. - Memorable year, Walter. - Is that so, Conrado? - A lot of stuff happened. - Like what? Like... - The first recording by the Beatles. - Right. - The embargo against Cuba. - What else? Algeria's independence. Oh, the World Cup, in Chile. And, oh, how could I forget... Cinema. The Given Word at Cannes. The Given Word. What a coincidence, huh, granny? Do you really think the religious customs of your time were so different from today's? Yes. If she says so... Who are we to disagree? Right, Conrado? - Bless Zé do Burro, Walter. - Bless the girls, Conrado. Let's not forget the grannies. We wouldn't be here without them. The mothers, Conrado. - That's how that saying goes. - It doesn't matter. I like the wrinkled ones. After a certain age their clit gets so rubbery it sticks to the tongue. Stop trash talking near the girls. But granny, these two girls are just too hot to go out dressed like this, aren't they? We're just wearing skirts, it's not illegal. That's true. It's legal. And the same men who wrote those laws... ...are nothing but a bunch of religious barbarians on a short leash. First chance they get they'll start eating each other just like in those zombie movies you watch. Do you know what they want? All they want is... ...to arrive at church on time and looking nice. The truth is... ...we can do whatever we want. Because in the end all that matters is to repent before the cross. That's how you justify your sins? That's how humanity justifies life. I don't need you to tell me how the world works. Watch out, Walter. Oh, excuse me. Good luck, Conrado. Don't let your guard down. Deep down, every woman is a little slutty. Actually, all of them are huge sluts. Maybe that's the true essence of being a woman, and that's why I try to protect Abigail. And I know that she has the seed... That little seed of a whore, inside her. I had a boyfriend. Do you think I never had one? I had. Actually, he wasn't much of a boyfriend... ...he was this guy who fucked me and then left me, never to call again. So you ask me why I'm so frustrated, why I'm such a huge bitch. There you go. It's because I was abused! No man has any right to do that to me. Hi, couple. Relax, you're too uptight. Let's do something to relax a little, you can ask me whatever you want. Just so I can say I'm a good democrat. Or, as my master used to say, let's practice "democratic centralism". You may ask me anything you want. Why did you shoot the owner? Someone always pays the price of respect. The Japanese had their heads blown up. The waiter died for your silence. What if he had chosen a different movie? That's just a detail. ...a detail. You're only killing the Swede? Are you going to kill us too? Only the Swede. It's just business. They ask us to do it, we do it. - And you just obey? - Sure. Someone has to do the dirty work. You do it for the money. Of course. Even commies have to buy their vodka. How do you know the Swede will be here tonight? He's always here. He and the owner had business together. He never missed a day. Don't you think about the Swede? If he has a family... ...if there's someone waiting for him at home, if he has a life? The waiter died for a lot less and you never asked those stupid questions. I see that the two of you are married. Marriage... A sacred vow of respect. You either follow the rules or you don't go to heaven, isn't that right? I guess you could look at it that way. I think marriage is a failed institution. It's something that has been imposed by our parents and grandparents. You need to settle for someone and make it work until the end... ...even though you can't stand the other person. That's backwards thinking. Divorce is common practice nowadays... ...anybody can get a divorce and nobody's out there hunting down divorcees. Then why get married in the first place? Just don't get married. You can't force a relationship to work, but you can try. You can look for someone you get along with, someone you feel you can build a life together... - ...that you feel might be right for you... - That's exactly the point. You look for someone wanting to change that person... ...thinking that you can turn them into... ...the image you have of them in your head... ...but they aren't who you want them to be. They are who they are. Did you know that a couple's sex life only last about five years? It's proven by science. By the way, how long have you been married? We've been married for five years. Look at that, right on the edge. But we've been together for over eleven. Wow. Any kids? No, but we're planning to change that soon. That's nice. When the kids come, then the sex is really gonna... You just won't care about it... ...with so much to worry about. If marriage was a good thing, there would be no need for witnesses. Don't laugh, Bruno. Don't laugh. Stop laughing. My dad took me to see this old concentration camp in Germany. I thought it was cool. But ever since I got back from Germany, sometimes I have this recurring dream as well... ...that I'm trapped inside this dark wagon... ...with orange walls and... ...I don't know where the train is headed. Want something to eat? I do. Conrado. The girls are hungry. Are they brave enough to eat something from this kitchen? - The food here is good. - Yeah, the food here is really good. So good that I just remembered the bean joke. Don't even think about telling that joke, Conrado. It's old as fuck. I agree. What joke are you talking about? Now you gotta tell it. That joke would only be funny again coming from a good comedian. I bet a kiss on granny that I can tell that joke better than Ary Toledo himself. - No way. - I bet a hundred bucks you can't. A hundred? I'll put down three hundred on my credit card. Seriously, what joke are you talking about? I'll take that kiss. - Nana! - Nana! Well, it looks like we have a bet! Hey, Ary! Tell us the bean joke. Oh, yeah! The bean joke? Oh, thank you, thank you... The bean joke, right? Well, it goes like this... There's this guy who goes into this restaurant called The Golden Feijoada. He was used to eating there, but on this day he looked down on his plate and... ...saw something that looked a lot like a hair and... ...he called the waiter to complain. He said "Waiter, look at this. Look at this in my feijoada. What the hell is this?". The waiter then said "Don't worry, sir. That's not what you think. It's just that we cook so much feijoada in this restaurant... ...that sometimes we take the whole bean... ...sack and shake it over the pot to cook it. Sometimes when we're shaking the bean sack over the pot... ...a string from the sack will fall into the pot, and that's what you're seeing there. It really isn't what you're thinking, alright?". The man goes "Well, alright then" and finished eating his feijoada. The man says it was very good and the waiter asks "What about dessert? We have ice cream, cakes, fruits...". "Fruit. I want a fruit salad". The waiter yells to the kitchen... "Hey Bean, he wants a fruit salad!". That settles it, Conrado. You lose. How did I lose? I haven't even told my version. And you won't. Do you think anybody here wants to hear the same joke twice? Get a grip. Funny, isn't it? Are you hungry? - Yeah. - Wanna eat? Hey, Conrado... ...go in the kitchen and cook something for the girls, they're hungry. - Why me? Let the cook do it. - What cook? The cook. Every restaurant has a cook, this shithole must have one too. We never went into the kitchen to see if there was a cook. Excuse me. Get out of there, motherfucker! Look who I found hiding under the sink, Walter. Well, well, well... What were you doing in the kitchen that you didn't see us here, huh? I heard a shot and I got scared, sir. Scared my ass. Do you think you can fool us, nigger? What's your name, boy? Evandro, sir. Evandro? What do you think of that name, Conrado? I prefer nigger. So do I. Say your name again, boy. - Evandro, sir. - Fuck Evandro. Your name is nigger. Say it. Evandro, sir. Nigger! Say it. Evandro, sir. - Say it. - Nigger. Nigger. Nigger. Nigger. Evandro, sir. Say it. Nigger. Did you hear something, Conrado? - I didn't hear a thing. - I didn't hear it either. So now I want you to say it loud enough for our clients to hear who's cooking for them. I'm nigger. The cook. Perfect. See? That's it. Now all of you say "Good evening, nigger". C'mon. Good evening, nigger. That's great. Now all of you get up, get in line and order a meal from the nigger. Just like that. Alright? C'mon, chop chop. Abby... Go ahead. Order what you want. - I want a ham and cheese sandwich. - Ham and cheese? Abby... We're in a Japanese restaurant. Then... I want a temaki? My sister is kinda dumb. It's not a secret. But I try to protect her... ...from any mistakes she could make in life. I think she's a little naive sometimes... ...and that's why I try to put up this safety net for her. My life is my family, my life is my grandmother and my sister. My grandmother and I are very... ...alike, in some ways. I admire her very much... ...because she's a person who loves life. I don't love life. But at least my days are more colorful, more joyful... ...some days really are worth living. I also admire my sister. I want her to know that I do because even though I may call her dumb, stupid, ignorant, naive... I admire her. I admire her light... You're so silly. - Go ahead. - I would like a temaki, please. I would like a temaki, please... Nigger. Say it. I would like a temaki, please, nigger. C'mon. I'm not saying that. - Why not? - Because I can't. You're all very politically correct, aren't you? You get outraged when someone throws a banana on the field or calls a soccer player an ape. Wake up, baby. In the ghetto near the doll house you live in... ...they kill a lot more black people than white people. And no one raises a flag against it. Nobody ever went pot banging to change that. Ok? Ok, cut! - Cut. How's the sound? - Sound's good. His make-up needs some touching up. Jessica! - Do we have time for a banana? - Check this out, man. - Let's take a selfie. - Selfie time. - Get together. - Whoa, selfie! Hang on... Ready. Are you feeling outraged because a white actor has been painted black? Roberto, come here for a second. What we're showing you right now is a recreation of the history of film. I'm sad to say that it was built on racism from the great producers. White actors used to be painted black to play roles that should've gone to black actors. It's called blackface. Even today, studios will limit black actors... ...to the roles of servants, subordinates... So, you wanna know why we still decided to go with a white actor in blackface? - Tell them, Roberto. - Because black people... ...have been slapped around too much. Right? - All set? Let's roll? - Let's roll. - One more take? Alright. - Moving on. Just let me check the focus here. Because he who pulls the focus... By the focus shall be pulled. What an awful pun, man. - Roll sound. - Camera 2 ready. Camera 3. - Camera 1. - Scene 1, take 28. Action. Tell us the truth, Abigail. You must have called a black guy a nigger in a moment of anger. Don't be a hypocrite. We're all friends here. Right, Walter? We're all friends, Conrado. Just tell us, Abigail. All white people are racist. When we're by ourselves and angry, we call them niggers. Instinctively. Admit it. Tell us. You can tell us. Yes. See? I'm not saying I already knew it, but I never had any doubt. By the way, all of you... Whoever called a black person a nigger at some point in life, show of hands. C'mon. No need to be shy about it. Then cut the bullshit, tell the nigger what you want to eat... ...and don't forget to thank him properly after you do it, ok? Bruno! - Tell us a nigger joke! - Me? - Yeah, you. - Tell a joke. - I don't know any jokes. - Yeah, you do. Tell us. Why don't we ask Ary to tell another one? No, no, no... No more jokes from me, no. That one I won't tell. It's not in my contract. See? - It looks like the spotlight is on you. - There's no way around it. - But guys, I don't know any jokes. - You do. - Bruno, just think of something. - Yeah, think. - Well, I know one! - Shut your mouth, Conrado. Bruno is gonna tell us a joke. Right, Bruno? - I got one... - Of course he's got one, Conrado. He has a great memory. Tell the joke. "Dear students", said the teacher. "Today I got some news for you, but it's more like an order. From now on there will be no more distinction between black and white children in our class room. From now on everyone is the same color. From now on, everyone is green. There's one minor detail, though... The dark green ones go to that side and the bright green ones to this side". Nice joke, huh, Conrado? Abby. You can go back to the table. The food will be there in a minute. - Alright. - You may go. C'mon, folks. Order up. We'll have a sushi mix for two, to share. - A hikano furai. - And a banana maki. What else? Please... Nigger. And you? Please, nigger. You can go now. I'd like edamame as an entrée. And cucumber salad. Gyoza. Shimeji, with chopped green onions sprinkled on top. Oh, and yakisoba too. Sashimi, of course. - That's it, I think. - Is that all? Oh, and a temaki too! Salmon and cream cheese topping, and some sake, of course. Please... Nigger. You're up, granny. First I'd like something to drink, so I want some sake mixed with gooseberry juice... ...and to eat... Wait a second, no sake. When I drink sake I end up taking my clothes off, making a scene. No, I want water, non carbonated, no ice. To eat... A yaki-sakana. Please... Nigger. Ok, go to your sit. Sometimes I cook at home. With Monica. She doesn't help a lot, she's not into that stuff, but she stands there, just watching. I didn't like when she said that I have the seed of a whore inside me. What a horrible thing to say. I had a boyfriend, it's true, but she didn't like him. I never even had the chance to introduce him to nana. She would say... She would say he only wanted to fuck me. That's not a nice word, is it? Nana calls it making love. Anyway, she'd say he only wanted to make love to me. Nana said she's been with a lot of men since grandpa passed away. I don't think she has the seed of a whore inside her. Get her some sake. Go get the food, Evandro. Hello. I'm Evandro. I'm the cook. Well, I come from a very humble family. Yeah, I was born in my grandmother's house. My father used to work on a plantation. He worked hard, but he would spend nearly all of his money on booze. His head wasn't in the right place. He was weak willed. He used to beat us, all the time. He would get home drunk and beat us. I had to start working when I was eight years old. To help with the income, and that was my life for a while. Just when I finally managed to start school, the worst happened. My older brother was killed. By the police. There were witnesses... ...who said he told the cop he was a working man and not a criminal. But even so, the cop shot him in the chest. He said that all niggers are criminals and shot him right in the chest. I can't understand why some people are like that, you know? We're all the same. We're all born naked, we come into the world alone, we leave alone, we love the same way... I can't understand that way of thinking, you know? C'mon, Evandro. Where's the food? It's taking too long! You only care about food! Life's true pleasures aren't in food. But I want the raw fish. Where's the raw fish? I want raw fish. - My grandpa taught me this. - Yeah? Your grandpa knew origami? I saw it in some pictures grandma showed me. - Like this, then you fold it like this... - My granddaughter is an artist. - What is that, just so we know? - Yay! Bring it over here, please. - Look at that, we even got raw fish. - Bring it over. - That's what we ordered, isn't it? - I think Walter should make a toast. Let's make a toast. I think so too, since he's the one in charge here. - Can I toast with water? - How can I toast with this? A toast... To the most beautiful thing on the table. Abigail. Thanks. I'd say it's actually the salmon here, but alright. I was watching this documentary about the Park Maniac the other day. - That's horrible. - It's amazing... Thousands of women get in line to fuck him in jail. It's like Stockholm's Syndrome, do you know what that is? - No, what is that? - It's what you're doing right now. What am I doing right now? You wanna fuck that disgusting old man. No... That's not it. It's not. Sorry. It's just that I think there was a spark between us... Who knows? You see, that boyfriend I had, we weren't together for a very long... - He only wanted to fuck you. - ...long time... Only wanted to fuck you. - Only wanted to... - But... And you didn't fuck him, so he dumped you. But he's older. You didn't fuck him, so he dumped you. But Walter is older. - End of story. - He's gonna want to, you know... Exactly. He's a horny old bastard. And you wanna fuck him. You want him to take you to a park, at night, to have a picnic. The Park Maniac, hello! Wake up, girl! Fuck! I already knew you were stupid, but not this stupid, you know? I mean... Maybe it isn't just stupidity, maybe there's something wrong with that childish... ...horny brain of yours, who knows? That seed of a whore, like I told you. I hate it when she says that. - Do you know how to use those sticks? - Of course! Then pick something up. - Oh, ok. - See? Yes. - What about it? Can we eat already? - Yeah, go ahead. Didn't I say the food is good? - Do you come here often? - We're here once a week. - Oh, yeah? - Every Thursday. We never saw you guys. We eat here all the time as well. - Do you also live nearby? - Yeah, we live in a condo nearby. We eat here because it's near our house, we can walk here. But I think we never came on a Thursday. Do you come once a week as well? Yeah, but not on Thursdays. You have a schedule or something? We mix it up, but it's usually on weekends, right? - Is that right? - I'm missing the soy sauce. Thursday is the day my granddaughters have their catechism class. - You go to catechism, Abby? - At that age? No nana, it's actually chrism. I'm about to chrismate. That's right, but they still need the class. I never did that. I don't even know what that is. I don't know either. I've postponed it because high school was too hard. You're a catholic family, then? Yeah... But we're non-pract... How do you say it? Practicing? - Practicing. - We don't go to church a lot. What do you do at chrism? We read the Bible, all the stories... And then there's the ceremony. Which one do you like the most? The Bible stories, I mean. - I like... - There she goes. The one about Daniel in the lion's den. Wow, you really pay attention to that stuff, huh? I like it! He's thrown into the den with the lions, but the lions don't eat him. - Why not? - Because God intervenes. - Really? God does that? - You better watch out, Conrado. People think I'm a little disturbed. That I see the people I've killed around me. - I don't get... - How cute. You put a bullet in my head and now you're all "to be or not to be... I came to this place, I don't know what I've become"... Son of a bitch. I wanna know why you killed me, fucktard - Are you really here? - No, it's a mirage. Want some candy? No... It could be poisoned, right? - Nothing's more sacred than the orgasm. - Now we're talking. - Grandma! - Now you're speaking our language. It's communion with infinity. Why do women fake orgasms? - Women fake orgasms? - Because of men. Because all men are sexist. Right, but sometimes you fake it to please your partner. - And what's that? Sexism. It's sexism. - There's no need for that. But... Sometimes men fake it as well. Because they don't know how to entice a woman. How can a man fake an orgasm? What's he gonna do... - ...spit on his hand and pretend it's cum? - That's disgusting! He can always pretend it was better than it really was. That he was more into it. - How the hell do you fake cumming? - You don't need to fake cumming... ...but you can act like you are more into it than you really are... No my dear, you can't fake a hard on. It's either hard or it isn't. - Yeah, there's no middle ground. - Monica. - No, Monica is right. It's hard. - Grandma taught these things. In that case, men are sacrificial lambs. You've been married a long time? Do you want kids? - We do. We really do. - Did you ever have an affair? - Can you still have kids at your age? - I'm 35 years old. We want to have children very soon, right? He doesn't seem very excited. We've been married for five years already, we've been together for more than eleven... - But Aline... - Wow! Eleven years! I think we should wait until we're alone to have this conversation. - But she asked us, Bruno. - Yeah, but we haven't decided yet. How can we talk about something we haven't decided? I think the moment I find myself in right now is very important, I think we should... We should follow our dreams right now, in the present. We never know when we're going to die. I'm afraid. Afraid of death. I lost my grandmother. My aunt is dying. Sometimes I can't sleep and I need to take sleeping pills. I've done a lot of tests, I'm afraid I have diabetes, I'm afraid of dying before finding happiness... ...before accomplishing even the simplest of my objectives... ...never becoming the person I wanted to be. I don't think you need too much to be the person you want to be. I'm a simple person. I like romantic films. I like funny stories, I like walking in nature. That's all. Then you come to a restaurant, not a care in the world, no worries on your mind... Nothing on your mind, you just want to relax, and suddenly you witness a murder... ...witness stuff you're simply not ready to see. That puts me face to face with death. This presence that's waiting for everyone. It can come at any time and... ...it will take you and you have no choice, you won't see it coming. To die you only need to be alive, right? We live in a very dangerous city. In a country, in a world that will fall apart if we aren't careful. So every time we go out on the street, we don't know if we'll ever get back home. We walk into a restaurant, a store, a mall, anywhere, and we don't know if we're safe. It's scary, very scary. People are locking themselves in their homes, in closed condos, because they're scared to death. Everybody is afraid of dying. Everybody is scared of dying. Nothing matters, there's no way out. It doesn't matter if you have money, it doesn't matter if you have protection... ...it doesn't matter if you have a husband, it doesn't matter if you have a family if death can reach you anywhere. Anytime. I'm sure of this. It can come in a violent way, it can come through disease... ...but it's looming over, all the time. Death is all around. You wanna bring another person into this world just to suffer, this violent world... ...this aggressive world where you have no freedom to be who you are... a world without morals, without ethics... - ...without anything. - No, I have moral standards that... I wanna pass on to our children. I wanna be someone who brought something into this world. Something good, something for the future. Someone that won't be another criminal, another lowlife or another person corrupted by society. Our children, they will be decent people. People who will make the world a better place. - All I know is I'll never breed. - You won't have children? - No way. - My kids won't have cousins? Of course not. I will never breed. I'm not bringing any more people into the world. People were made just to suffer their whole life. Do you think anybody can stand you sister? Because I'm not that selfish... What an irritating person, she refuses to shut up. Wanting to leave something behind, got it? - Looking for immortality. - Monica was always a liberal thinker. I can't stand sitting here talking about my life anymore, nobody is paying attention to me... There's a lot of noise around, you're all talking around me and I can't take it anymore, alright? It's always been like this all my life, I'm alone. Everybody else is dancing, having fun, making friends... "oh, the light of life, how wonderful life is, it's great to be alive". Fuck that! I can't take it anymore, got it? Life sucks, everybody is dying. Everybody is dying, everybody is suffering... Everybody will end in a hospital sticking themselves with morphine and wishing for a painless death. Bunch of hypocrites. I'm a hypocrite too. Here I am wearing this pretty dress, this bow, look at it, there's rhinestone on this piece of shit. I have no idea why I even put this on. Even though I say I don't wanna get involved with men that... I don't want a husband, that I don't wanna get married, that I don't want anything... ...deep down, I kinda want those things. Because I can be a slut too. The thing is Abigail is a helpless romantic. That she is. I think you gotta have a lot of kids, you know? I wanna have a bunch of children running around the house. I don't think so. I think it'd be annoying. Very annoying. And then, they would make a line to make pancakes. She'll breed like an animal, that one. Just don't leave them with grandma, alright? Make pancakes? I won't, but on weekends it's ok, isn't it, nana? Like us. Remember how much fun we used to have at nana's house? We would run around the house, make a mess, try on her clothes, it was awesome. - I want my kids to have that too. - That's nice. You're selfish, that's what you are. You're afraid of getting old and not having anyone to take care of you. That's the truth. That's the truth to everybody here. I like life. I love life. In its androgyny and bipolarity. Life is amazing, it's wonderful. Every day I'm thankful for another day to live. Because I make myself available to life, I have an incredible will to live. I love to dance, to sing, to love, to make love. Everything. Everything I'm entitled to and a lot more. Grandma, you have to teach your granddaughter to be a little more... Monica always had a liberal way of thinking, I can't help her. That's not a liberal way of thinking, that's a grumpy way of thinking. - That's true. - So much bitterness. Stop that, girl. - Oh, the fun police is here. - That's right. When I see everything falling apart I try to help. Right, Abby? That's what I'm here for. I agree with him. I don't think people have children just so they won't die alone. Most of them do. Some people have things they want to pass on to their children, you know? - Pass on? - Pass on. Pass on what? In this crazy world we live in. Pass on what? Are you talking about diseases? - Pass on a disease, right? - Do you wanna pass diseases to children? - What are they talking about, Monica? - They said they have a lot to pass on. - I think you should have like three kids. - What a weird couple. Not him. Not this guy. Right Walter? People, look at his face. He doesn't wanna have kids. - This isn't the right time to have kids. - You'll end up too old to have kids. It's not the right time. The right time will never come, right Bruno? - We're not financially prepared. - When will we ever be prepared? We've only just started, we're still enjoying our life together, we're still young. We can't have kids now. We barely did anything together. - A kid? - Bruno, you gotta shave... ...those sideburns and... - ...think like you're in the 60's. - Yeah, those sideburns aren't working. - I kinda like it, you know? - Yeah, those are pretty tacky. And that little D'Artagnan mustache, what the hell? Yeah, that looks ridiculous. Say, why don't you work on your appearance? And why put so much mousse on your hair? - I don't get it. - Yeah, what about that hair? I happen to work in a place that has strict rules about appearance. - They like that? - They like that. No. Wait a second. If the place has strict rules about appearance, you're gonna get fired. Actually, they would fire a person for having a patchy beard, scraggly hair... But our job doesn't have strict rules about appearance. No one cares if we look nice. Alright, Conrado, but I think you should do... - ...something about your looks. - Yeah, take off that hat. Calm down, guys. What's with all the vanity? When we die... - You're sloppy with your hair. - Better than you... ...It looks like you have a bunch of pubes on your head. Bruno, stop being so vain. When we die we're all going underground anyway. - That's true. - Only our spirits will remain. - Sometimes not even the spirit. - The spirit stays... And you'll have to fulfill your karma, you know that? Based on who you were on Earth. - I believe in ghosts. - You do? Well, then he's fucked. He's fucked. - What's with all the judgment? - What do you think he'll come back as? - He's gonna be a cockroach. - No, you don't come back as a cockroach. You come back as people. Come back as people... Worst than you are now? - But... - He might come back a tiger! Wait... When you were kids, what did you wanna be when you grew up? At last, it seems my dream has come true. I'm in a movie and... I even have subtitles. I can speak in any language I want. Be it French... English or... Or Russian. But I'm gonna stick with Portuguese. Friend, you don't need to subtitle this stuff, I'm already speaking Portuguese. Please. - Oops. My bad. - It's alright. I always loved the movies. When I was a kid... I used to watch that cyborg, the Six Million Dollar Man. I loved that stuff. Then after some time... ...two or three years, I started to enjoy... ...watching heads exploding... ...throats getting slashed... ...and I wanted to do those things. My mother... ...noticed I liked acting and making movies, playing with my dad. I used to punch my dad a lot. He would help me, he was my supporting actor. Then she started taking me to these auditions for commercials and... I got a few. I got a few. Then I got some bigger roles, it was good. But when you get to that point you start hearing some shit. People saying that you just got lucky. Lucky my ass. I used to do shows across the country... ...with a bunch of people who sang and danced, there was even a samba school. I would get lice, diseases, venereal diseases, everything. And then you have to listen to people telling you how lucky you are when something good happens. Life's unfair. It's hard for me to judge people. And it's hard for them not to judge me. It's easier to blame myself. I got myself into this life in the most cliche way possible. I was walking the streets, head hung low. This guy saw me and asked me if I was sad. I told him I didn't know what else to do in this world. He said he had a job for me. I took it. That's how I started my life in crime. The Swede could show up here today and... ...kill me. But to me this isn't a movie, this is reality. Reality! What do you mean "street smarts"? That's what bums say when they don't have anything else to say. No, no, Monica. He's right. You gotta have street smarts. Monica never went to college, right Mon? Yeah, but I don't go around telling people I got "street smarts", because I don't... - You just don't have it. That's it. - Wait. Shut up. Listen, he's gonna tell us about the first person he killed. I never liked uptight, square people. Even Abigail scares me a little sometimes, I think she's extremely... Square. I try to be a standard grandmother, but I actually prefer Monica. Even though she's a little disillusioned with life, she's stronger. She's better at facing life. So I always liked the outcasts better. I never... I never liked people who put themselves in molds, always nice, uptight. Don't kill it, jackass! - See that? Conrado is an animal lover. - What the hell, Conrado? Why kill the poor thing? It's just flying around. Conrado doesn't like to see animals getting killed. Don't fight. Conrado doesn't like it. He gets like that every time he sees an animal being mistreated. Conrado, you have more secrets than I imagined. When I was a kid... My mother used to put me inside this furnace. It was like an oven where they burned wood. They would lock me in there. They'd shut the door and only open it again at night. I even got used to it. I would watch the sun light through the vents. I'd stay there until evening. Dad forgot he had put me in there one day. He started throwing wood in there with me, then alcohol and set it on fire. The fire started rising, I started screaming, but he didn't seem to care. I started noticing an expression of pleasure on his face and he started to laugh... ...saying "Is it warm in there? Is it warm?". Then he pulled me out. That look on his face... Stayed with me. The pleasure in his eyes. - She doesn't want it. - It's too much. But I shouldn't leave it. Nana always said there are places in the world where people are starving so... ...we shouldn't let any food go to waste. I think all of us should take a piece of that. - You wanna try it? - I think we all should take a bite. - Starting with grandma and coming this way. - I think it's better to start over there. Let's start over there? Give it here, Abby. Let's start with you, then. It's loaded with wasabi. I'm sorry, I like the heat from the wasabi. You know that life's tough for those who tease, right? I put a lot of wasabi on it, because I like it. I hope that it'll be finished by the time it gets here. I like wasabi. You're eating too much, there's not gonna be enough. - No, you're eating it too. - I'm just being generous. - Just a small bite, Walter. - C'mon, Walter. Eat the damn thing. Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! No! No! No, Walter! Eat it, Walter! - It's so good. - Is that an alien? - That's an alien, alright. - Don't you like salmon? - I don't like aliens. - It's not an alien. - Eat it, Walter. - He's so silly, isn't he? C'mon, c'mon. Eat it, Walter. Show us you can. - Delicious. Granny. - No, it's her turn now. - I already ate half of it. - It's true. - Monica's turn. - That is so good! Delicious. I think it was really cool that we shared my temaki. - That temaki was truly a bread baked... - By the Devil. - ...that I parted. - Don't say that. - Don't say that. - Sorry. Congratulations, we are a family now. - That's nice. - Jeez. Let's have a toast then. We're a family now. - What do we do now, Walter? - Improvise, Conrado. Ary, sing us a song. I'm gonna sing you all a song that I wrote called Zé's Ballad, it goes like this... Zé, oh why... Did I fall for you? Zé, oh Why... Did I fall for you? Folks, listen very closely to this tale I'm about to tell. I used to be a tiny girl with perky tits, everything in place. On every street I walked, all the boys would stop and flirt. I'd give them all a boner, I swear I was a real knockout. Zé, oh why... Did I fall for you? You. Folks, I was truly stunning, I was a virgin and smoking hot. One day I met Zé, who made me a woman and stole my heart. He looked nice, but the son of a bitch turned out to be jerk. He dragged me to the bushes, took my dignity, knocked me up. I'm going to recite a poem I wrote some time go. This poem is called "Love". "Love. Love the crazy ones. Love the crazy ones in their sanctities petrified. Submerged in mystery and hallucinations. Primitives and innocents. No gags on their heads. Parading without ego on crooked bridges. Mere side characters in a world of obscure, decaying stars. In their deafening emptiness... ...they flap their wings sprinkled with praise. Magicians of reality. Transforming hidden pains in solitary twitching. Asleep in the rusty cradles... ...of hostility... ...and nonconformity." That's nice. Now only the virgins. Zé, oh why... What the fuck, what kinda of place is this that still has virgins? You wanna know what? Fuck you all, I'm not singing anymore. What do we do now? Conrado! Conrado? Let's boogie, Walter. Conrado, now a song just for the couples. You bet your ass, Walter. Walter... Why are doing this to me? I'm preparing you for life. But, why did you choose me when you walked in here? Because today, when I left my house I made a promise to myself that... I'd find the woman of my life and quit everything. - Don't be silly. - It's true. If you're really such a nice guy why did you choose this life? Because I needed this life to get to you. - Then why did you do that? - What? Why did you touch me without my permission? You're right. I will never touch you without your permission again. "Love is the law, love under will". Now I want you to touch me. - You do? - Yes. Then say it loud. - I want you to touch me. - Louder. I want you to touch me. Now I want you to yell it so everybody can hear you. I want you to touch me! - Abby! - Monica. - Abby! - Walter. - Abby! - Monica. - Nana? - Nana! - Conrado. - Walter! - Nana? - Nana! Conrado... Walter! Enough! - When I'm older I wanna get married... - Take it up the cunt. - ...I'm gonna wear all white... - Take it up the cunt. - ...and I'm gonna walk the aisle... - Take it up the cunt doggy style. - ...next to Nana. - Take it up the cunt. - And Monica... - Take it up the cunt like a whore. - ...is gonna be the bridesmaid. - Up the asshole too. - The church will be... - You're gonna suck a lot of dick too. - I want white... - Deep down, that's all you want. - And... - Take it up the cunt. - It's gonna be a real pretty wedding... - Take it up the cunt. - Monica will be my bridesmaid... - Take it up the cunt! - ...but she... - Take it up the cunt. - ...is also going to carry the rings. - Take it, take it, take it, take it... It will be real pretty... My wedding. And then you're gonna suck his cock, he's gonna cum in your mouth and you'll love it. Right, you slut? I wanna break free. Can't go on living this way. I feel so tired. A bomb about to explode. I thought I'd die a virgin. Helpless little girl. Living on the edge. Between scrapes and stings. I will pour out my blood. I want you inside of me. Penetrate me without guilt. I'm a woman in blossom. I wanna fuck. Enter! Enter! Make me moan. Enter! Enter! I wanna get dirty. Enter! Enter! Make me lose my mind. Enter! Enter! I wanna cum. I'll make you a woman in seven days, honey. This is our love story All this time feeling repressed. Now you'll only know glamour. Let's make the best of this life. I want you without shame. Moan! Moan! I wanna fuck. Moan! Moan! I'm not gonna stop. Moan! Moan! I'm gonna cum. Moan! Moan! Aaaah... Just don't forget the pill... So you won't get knocked up... Just don't forget the pill... So you won't get knocked up... So you won't get knocked up... Oh, yeah! I've always dreamed about meeting my prince charming. I know it sounds silly but... ...a guy like that... ...who would just look at me... ...and we would fall in love and... ...live an adventure... ...get married and... ...live happily ever after. Smile, boy. Smile. That's cute. Go, go, go. Go! My bouquet? Left foot. Dearly beloved. We are gathered here today in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Knowing this, I ask of you, if anyone here knows a reason why these two should not be wed... ...speak now or forever hold your peace. I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. I see the two of us leaving here holding hands and... ...heading to a park... ...to have a picnic, at night. And we'll look at the stars together. Lay down under the moonlight. Walter will open a bottle of wine and then... I'm gonna fuck his brains out. You whore. I knew it. - Stop it, Monica! Stop it! - I knew you would do this to me... ...you little slut. - Stop it! Nana! - Slut! - Monica! Monica! - You little slut. Welcome to restaurant Reverie! - Put your hands up. - Who are you? Put your fuckin' hands up! Where's Tomato? What did you do to him? Forget about Tomato. We blew up his head. You killed my friend? - Relax, big head! - Tell us... Are you the Swede? "The Lovely Negotiation of the Dwarf Banana" Hello, my friend Dwarf Banana! Hello, my friend Orange Head! How was your day? Great! How's the family? Very good! My son is really growing. My wife is feeding him a dietary supplement made from horse manure. That's wonderful! I have a whole bunch of brothers who love that supplement. What about work, how's it going? Oh, you know... Too sour. The lemons are more productive this year. Our harvest hasn't been good. The dollar high is really screwing with us, isn't it? Yeah... Globalization is making everything rotten. Our best professionals are being exported and we're left with nothing but the waste. We're literally slipping on our peels! I don't know what will become of our crops. We're facing our biggest moment of uncertainty. We have to punish them. Throw some tomatoes! Punishment is not the solution! Violence only brings more violence. The fruit is born good, but the worms consume it. The saplings aren't sprouting! Our freedom of expression is questionable. Everything needs to be explained. We're being squeezed! Chopped! Art isn't thinking anymore. Ever seen a movie that doesn't instigate violence? None. What does that mean? I think it's just a way of getting to the pulp. I don't like that way. Yeah... I have my doubts about that too. Are you the Swede? Of course he's the Swede, Conrado. What do you mean "of course"? How do you know? You've never seen a swede before? Yes. They all have big heads and orange skin. There you go. I love when it's time to talk about movies. White people... Ever seen a movie that doesn't instigate violence? THE MAN WITH THE ORANGE HEAD Hey, wait! I'm not finished yet. Was it cute?
