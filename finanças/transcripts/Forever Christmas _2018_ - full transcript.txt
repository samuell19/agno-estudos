[Reporter] Coming up on KTLA 5: This season's hottest Christmas gifts! It's November 1st people, give us a break! Hi. How's your day so far? You heard, right? Barely into my first episode and already it's a mess. Potential mess. Anyway, why do you think I recommended you for this job? Because I haven't worked in almost a year and my career was vanishing before my very eyes? Guess again. Because I'm your oldest friend? Because you're smart and resourceful, and good at troubleshooting. And there's plenty of trouble to shoot around here. Now you tell me. It's true, you can handle it. Except for getting over that cheat Marco and the whole man embargo. It's been way too long, Soph. Over Marco. No embargo. Not looking. Please! If you're living, you're looking. Sophia! Sit, please. Help. I always thought the Sexy Santa Society sounded a little... sketchy. Who knew they were going to get busted for running an illegal escort ring? And we just thought they serviced shopping malls. They certainly put the "ho" in "ho-ho-ho." To be honest, I always thought doing a whole episode on the group seemed a little exploitive. Even for a show called "Extreme Holidays." Oh, I'm sorry we aren't as noble as the cooking shows that you were working on. Yeah, well, there's nothing noble about getting cancelled. Or being unemployed. Ain't that right? Now, check out the article I just sent you, okay? I forgot all about this guy, but it just might work. Guy celebrates Christmas 365 days out of the year? - Yeah. - I can hardly handle it one day. That's why we're not doing a show about you. What kind of oddball is this Will Saunders? A devoted one, apparently. His house is a shrine to all things yuletide. And he does charity work: kids, pets, and homeless people. So, he should want to do this. And, if he's not a complete freak, we should want to, too. I can't even tell what he looks like underneath this reindeer get up. Nothing about his personal life except for 33, has a history in production and carpentry in scenic design. That makes sense, I guess? I just sent you the number from the studio where he works. I want you to find him, meet him, and sell him. You have one day, sorry. I'm on it! Oh, and don't forget that the entire Bravada TV deal, not to mention your future as a producer here, hinges on the success of this show. So... no pressure. None at all. Thank you! No Twitter, no Instagram... Social media ghost. Hi, is this Will? Will, this is Sophia Worthy. I'm with Super Real Productions. I am producing a new reality TV show about the holidays, and we... I got your phone number from your work, I hope that's okay. Anyway, this whole "every day is Christmas" thing you do sounds really... fascinating... and I wondered if we could meet and talk about filming you for the show? Oh, can I ask you why not? Well, yeah, it's reality TV, but not how you think... That's a drag. You know, it really could have brought a lot of attention to all that great charity work you do. Oh yeah! It could have been a big part of it. Amazing! How does tomorrow morning sound? Yes, I do know that place. 10:00 a.m.? Perfect! I'll see you then. Okay, bye. Charmer. Yes! Excuse me, Will? Sophia from Super Real Productions. Sorry, my bad. I thought you were someone else. Sophia? You're Will? You were expecting an elf? Maybe? What can I get you? Oh no, it's on me. Well, it's on Super Real Productions, actually. What do you want? Thank Super Real, but it's on me. No arguments. Okay. Medium, non-fat, half-caf, no foam latte, with a teaspoon of agave. Coming right up. Can I get a medium, non-fat, no foam, half-caf latte, with a teaspoon of agave? Christmas blend, and just a regular Christmas blend for me. Thanks. What's this? Just a little something for you. Open it. My first gift from Mr. Christmas. I could get used to this. Is that so? I mean... I meant, the gifts you must give... The pink one's strawberry, the yellow is lemon, and the orange is passion fruit. How did you know I liked macaroons? Just a guess. They seem kind of fancy... like you. Fancy? Interesting. Hope you like Christmas blend, I used it for your latte. It may or may not surprise you that I wait for it all year long. I love Christmas blend, it's my favorite. Yay! So you live around here? Yeah, I'm in Vista Gardens. A little bungalow right in the canyon. I know the place, actually. Really? Yeah, a friend of mine used to live right next door, I think. Beautiful spot. Quaint. So, the show. The show, right. Look, I don't want to disappoint you... But I'm a pretty low-key guy and the whole reality show deal just isn't really my thing. And honestly, people don't understand what I do. Or why I do it. Then let's change their mind. You could create a whole new massive wave of Christmas enthusiasm! What's in it for you, exactly? A skeptic, are we? Been down this road before. Okay... the truth? Our story just fell through and if we don't find a new one ASAP we're screwed. My last show went belly up and I need to prove myself. To be honest with you, I don't know if you are right for the show, not until I see your house. But after meeting you, I think you could be great on television. How's that, mystery man? That was honest. I'm impressed. And between you and me, I am cuckoo for Christmas. Producing a show like this would be a dream come true. If you like my house. Right, I'd have to see your house first. So can I? I'm not sure. I'll have to think about it. Right, of course. Think about it and let me know. But I have to know by the end of the day. [Paul] So... he's not the oddball you thought he was going to be? Nope, he's actually kind of a regular guy with an irregular hobby. And he's also kind of on the hot side. Really? How hot? Like fireman meets GQ model meets superhero hot. You're going to like him. I'm married. I don't have the luxury of liking anyone anymore. 4:45. End of day. [cell phone vibrating] Hey. Will? Hi, it's Sophia Worthy. Ah, Sophia Worthy. Is it the end of the day already? We're getting there. So, what did you decide? Wow, cutting right to the chase. Listen Will, if you're not going to do it, please just tell me now. Okay, I don't want to do it. Oh... But that doesn't mean I won't. Or that I will. I'm confused. At this point, all I can offer is an invitation for you to see my home. How's half an hour? Nothing like playing hard to get. Is that what you're doing? Let me give you my address. [door knocking] - Hi. - Hey. Welcome to my humble abode. Humble? More like amazing. It was my grandparents home. I inherited it. And who's this? This is Romeo. My vicious guard dog. They're a pretty good judge of character. Come on! I'd say holy cow, but I'm assuming you've probably heard something like it. Doesn't get old, trust me. How do you keep those floating like that? They're suspended on a filament that washes out in the light. Tricky. Tricks of the trade in the movie business. Follow me. Oh, and don't mind the mistletoe. It's everywhere. Thanks for the warning. Wow... How do you keep those snowing like that? Wait, don't tell me! More trade secrets? So, how did this all start? Honestly, I've always loved Christmas. You could call me a Christmas enthusiast. 7 or 8 years ago I was working on a small Christmas movie that ran out of money. So they paid me with scenery and special effects. Which was cool, but then I thought where the hell am I going to put it all when it's not Christmas? And the rest is history? Or hysteria, take your pick. It's gorgeous. And a little trippy. But in a good way! Over here, come on. May I present: Christmas under the Sea. It is so romantic. And peaceful. Unless you're the seasick type. Which I'm not. A friend of yours? Oh yeah, that's my second cousin, Ariel. He loves the ladies, that one. Little Romeo - did you teach him everything he knows? Just gave him the name. Good answer. So... how long have you lived here for? You said you inherited it? From my grandparents, those two right there. It's so modern. I had to gut the entire home: Interior, exterior... But I kept the original bones. So now, it's modern with a heritage spine. What about your parents? They didn't want the house? I'm sure they would have, but they died when I was a kid. Long story, but I actually grew up here. With my grandparents. Who were major Christmas fans, and my inspiration when I decided to turn my home into a Christmas extravaganza. Extravagant it is. Pop quiz, Miss Cuckoo for Christmas: who's your favorite ornament maker? Me? I don't know, I would say I'm kind of like an equal opportunity ornament fan. Ah, I get it. Wouldn't want to offend any of Santa's helpers. Exactly! And here we have "The Train Room". All aboard? It's amazing. My grandpa was a big collector who got me going on it. And when I started doing all this to my home, the train set grew like crazy. I'm always working on it, it keeps me busy... And out of trouble! Sorry about that! Hank, meet Sophia. Sophia, Hank: my right hand man. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Sophia. Sophia wants to make us TV stars. Will hasn't agreed to it yet. Help me out, would you? You guys, this looks so good. It's going to look amazing on TV. Which I haven't agreed to, yet. Sorry, I know. I'm a producer, the wheels are always turning. Right. Want to see it in action? Yeah. Check it out. So good! Hank seems nice. He's the best. He stays here sometimes when the shelter's full. And I hire him for odd jobs here and there. He's homeless? Without a permanent home. For now. He had one, lost it. Amongst other things. We're working on it. Will, your house is wonderful. I would love for you and your home to star in our show. So what do you think? I think... How do I know you won't make me look like an idiot? You've just got to trust me, I guess. Yeah? Yeah. For what it's worth, I'd like to mention that I was a documentary film major in college. So I know how to get to the truth. Really? So why reality TV? I suppose real life got in the way? Something called paying the bills came knocking. Fair enough. I'd also like to mention that we are willing to make a serious donation to a charity of choice. You're killing me. I just... I don't know. Your house is unbelievable, Will. The way you do Christmas and the legacy of your grandparents. How great would it be to, on screen, show everybody the beauty of that? I just know that people would flip over you, and your home and your story. And why you do it, and how you do it. Your house is one of a kind. You're one of a kind. I have to confer with my business manager. [whispering] What do you think? Okay. Okay? We'll do it. Will, this is amazing! Thank you! You are not going to regret this! Who's the happy camper? Oh, you'll find out... Wow, what a beauty! Imagine when it's all decorated and lit up! I bet the crowds are crazy. Yes, but his crabby neighbor hates those crowds. He got an injunction, so he's not allowed to start decorating until Thanksgiving. Nice neighbor. So, plan accordingly, Linz. I know the type. He'll be the first to want a location fee. Guaranteed. Let's go! The gang? Yes. Will, this is Lindsey, Kayla, and Aaron. Our A-team of lights, camera and... - Action? - Sound. Action is good too, Will. And this is Romeo, our Extreme Holidays mascot. Romeo, are you ready for your close-up? At least one of us is. Let me know if you have any questions, okay? Yeah, I got one. Got any idea what a nightmare it is to shoot all this white on white on white? Sorry, I didn't design it with TV in mind, dude. Relax, Aaron. I've seen you shoot tougher. All these projections could be pretty tricky to light. Thanks, Kayla. Are you okay? Yeah, just taking it all in. Do you mind if they get a lay of the land? Check things out a bit? Okay, that would be great. Give us some more time. Fan out everyone! Just don't go in any rooms that are being redone! And watch out for wet paint! It's okay. Your beautiful house is in good hands. I promise. As are you. I'm going to hold you to that. I'm gonna go follow them. You want to join? Sure, after you. Thanks a lot, Will. We'll see you Monday morning. Monday? Like four days from today, Monday? Didn't you say your hiatus started in four days? Yeah, but I've got a ton of work to do on the house. No worries, Will. That's why the crew is here to help. No crew. Just me and Hank only, please. You know what? Why don't you guys go? I'm just going to grab an Uber and chat with Will about a few things. Shotgun! Fred! What's all the hubbub, Saunders? Reality TV show. This is my producer, Sophia. Sophia, meet Fred. Hi! Television, huh? How much are you paying for our inconvenience? Don't worry, you'll be compensated for your trouble. The producer is going to reach out to you shortly. She better. Put up with enough as it is around here. So... you want a drink? Yeah, I could have some water. I can facilitate that. So, you should have your contract by tomorrow. Let me know if you have any questions. So I can still back out? Seriously? Listen: Christmas means all the world to me. Obviously, you can see. And I do this to share it with others. But personally. One-on-one. My way. What's that supposed to mean? Maybe I jumped into this too quickly. I do that sometimes. Listen: this is going to be hectic, inconvenient, and a total disruption of your nice, cozy life. But you won't regret it. I promise. Umm... I've gotta go. I should go. All right... I will see you later, I guess. Looking forward to it. Okay! These people haven't given you much time to get ready, have they? I'll never really be ready. Don't ask me why I'm doing this. Oh, I know why you're doing this. That obvious? She's beautiful. And smart, and persuasive. The way I see it is if I can help promote the charities I work with, use the show for good, then I guess it's worth it. Maybe it's a good opportunity to talk about the shelter. That's a good idea, Hank. I'll put that on the wish list. Along with Sophia? Oww! Oh my gosh, it is perfect. There he is! Hi, I'm Paul Rivera. I'm the executive producer and creator of the show. Hi! AKA my boss, so you've got to be nice to him. I absolutely love what you've done with the place. It is wonderful. Our only hope is that we can do it justice. And you, too, of course. Why don't you come with me? I'm going to give you a rundown of the day. Great, we'll see you in a bit. Nice to see you again, Miss producer. It's nice to see you again, too. Okay, so today is mostly just going to be shots of the house, bits and pieces of you talking and explaining and we're going to get a shot of you greeting us at the front door. Does that sound good? Yeah. I guess. As the old saying goes: if it doesn't work, we'll just fix it in post. That's what I'm afraid of. Don't worry. I figured you like to make lists. Here's mine: these are some of the charities I work with. I think it would be good to put them in the interviews. Got it. Okay, while they're getting set up, let's get you in hair and makeup. Makeup? No, I don't wear makeup. On camera everyone wears makeup. Is this our boy, Soph? Yes Gia, this is Will. Sit. Smile. Look pretty. Which shouldn't be a problem for you. Will, look, I know a lot of guys don't like the whole makeup idea, but the point is to make you look like you don't have on makeup on. Let me get this straight, you want to put makeup on me so I look like I don't have makeup on me? That is why they call it reality TV! How we doing? Good! Just getting golden boy ready. So, what do you think? Dude, or dwarf? What for? For Will. To wear in the opening shot. We never discussed a costume... Please hold still, Will. I'm not wearing a costume. What about the reindeer suit you wore in that article? That was a costume. I was playing Rudolph for the kids, for charity. One time! Well, now you'll be playing Christmas dude. Or dwarf. Ta-dah! Adorable. I don't want to look "adorable." Okay, honey, that ship has sailed. She just means we love the way you look already. We do, but the audience has a certain expectation. Namely, holiday cheer. So let's be cheery, shall we? Take this. Thank you. Did you know about this? I had no idea. Look, you told me that sometimes you can be impulsive. So... how about now? That's the one. Okay, Will. Sophia is going to call action. You're going to open the door and say your first line. Then you're going to step back, open the door a little more like you're inviting us into your home, and Aaron is going to do a beautiful tracking shot right inside. Cool? What's my line? Oh sorry, it's... Hi, I'm Will Saunders. Welcome to my magical Christmas wonderland! Isn't that a little corny? Christmas is corny. Not to me. Why don't we just drop the "magical" and stick with the rest? Okay. And... Action! Hi, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. Cut! Let's go again, Will. This time just a little livelier. Ready, and... action! Hi, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. Again! Okay that was a lot better, Will. We're just going to go one more time. Good work. And... action! Hi, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. Cut! Okay Will, This is television. You need to pretend to be happy, okay? You're super excited about your house and you can't wait to share it with the world. But I'm not and I look ridiculous. Fake it, Will. It's TV. How about we get rid of the shirt? We love the shirt. Not all of us love the shirt. Hugo? Can you please get his shirt from the green room? -On it! Okay. Let's try that again. Ready? And... action! Hey, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. And cut! That was perfect, Will! Really? Oh yeah. Super. So Will, first thing's first. What do you think sets you apart from other Christmas enthusiasts? I don't know, I guess when it comes to Christmas, I'm all in. 110%. You could say 365%. Very true. But I can't take all the credit. I had a lot of help along the way. Starting with my grandparents. My grandma actually... I'm sorry, grandparents? Will, I'm curious. You're a young, strapping lad. You're single, you probably have a very active dating life, how do women react when you bring them back here? Women? They like it, I guess, but usually everyone does... So you could say that this place is kind of a chick magnet? Chick magnet? Yeah! They come and see all the Christmas joy and they're like, "Which way to the sleigh bed?" Am I right? I'm sorry, what kind of questions are these? Fun ones! Will come on, we love hearing about your grandma and all that stuff, yadda, yadda, yadda. It's great. But look at you: you're a fireman meets GQ model meets superhero. So, Christmas aside, the folks are going to want to hear a little dirt. I think I need a break. Yeah, of course. Everyone take five! Really? What? I thought it was a legitimate question. You asked where the sleigh bed was. I know that was kind of weird, but... Paul was just doing his job. What are you two like good cop and bad cop? What? No! Wait, I'm the good cop, right? You tell me. Look, we had a deal. And it didn't include me talking about my love life. He was trying to loosen you up, in his own way. I'm sure none of it's going to end up on the show. Sophia, this is my life. It's important to me. I don't pretend to be perfect, far from it. But I try to stand for a few good things. And that comes across loud and clear. Look, just say what you want to say. Forget about the questions. Don't listen to Paul. It will slide off of him like Teflon. Just take a deep breath. I know this is weird and new. It sure feels nice. I meant... I know what you meant. But it still feels nice. Hey, maybe we could... donate the leftover lunch food to the shelter? I could get Hank to pick it up. Yeah. I'll have to ask Lindsey, but I don't see why not. Thanks, Sophia. That'd be great. All right, are you ready to face the big bad cameras again? I only need you for one more shot. All right... No one has ever asked to donate leftovers to any other place than their own refrigerator. This guy is sexy and saintly. So we can do it then? To keep our star happy? Sure. Oh, no! I left him with Paul. I really hope he's okay. See? You don't have to worry about Paul. One thing I know about Paul: he knows how to charm the pants off of anyone. I have a feeling those particular pants are going to be staying on. Maybe for Paul... What's that supposed to mean? I've seen the way he looks at you. So what are you going to do about it, sunshine? I'm going to get this last shot. And stay away from all mistletoe at every cost. Is that a professional decision or that whole "all hot dudes are heartbreakers" thing you got going on? Sweetie, not every guy you like is gonna turn into Marco. It is statistically and physically impossible! Thank you, have a good day! You too, bye! All right, let's go! Up top, Will! No? Are you the fist bump type? I'm good with that. I know there were some hiccups, but you actually kind of rocked it. You're welcome. Is that what I'm supposed to say? I saw you chuckling with Paul. You were making friendly. That's a good sign. There are only a few fleeting pockets of horrible. Better than I expected. How's that? I'm going to give you some advice. Have a beer, or six, and a nice dinner, and get a good sleep. Want to join me on that? Join you for dinner? Actually, I can't. As much as I kind of, really want to. I'll take "really kind of want to" for the future. Good night, Sophia. Good night, Will. [TV on in background] [door knocking] Hi. - Will? - Sophia! What are you doing here? How do you know where I live? (A) I get nicer greetings at the DMV. (B) You told me when we first met. (C) Can I come in? Yeah, sure... I hope you like irises. I do! They're beautiful. From my front lawn. But flowers all the same. Very Van Gogh of you. What are they for? An apology. For being such a grouch today. A grouch? I kinda was... But I also needed an excuse to come over here. Right. Thinking about the questions Paul was asking today. About me being a chick magnet. And I just wanted to clarify that I am not some sort of player. Thank you... I think. It felt like Paul was kind of trying to make me seem like one. You know, for television entertainment. Maybe he just thinks you're cute. I like your place. It's quirky, elegant. Yeah? Even without gifts hanging from the ceilings and mermaid murals on the wall? I can arrange that. I know people. Do you want to sit? Yeah, just for a minute. I'm doing this reality TV show and these people show up at the crack of dawn, so... Sounds like it sucks. Oh, it does... But there's this hot producer lady who kind of makes it all worthwhile. Stop! I can't. Okay. This is really bad. It's really bad for the show. And for me professionally. Okay. No! I can't, I can't... What? You don't like the way I kiss? I do. I like the way you kiss too much. A lot. Which is why you need to go. Thank you for the flowers and the kiss. I will see you tomorrow. You are one disciplined girl. You will thank me later. Thank you. Goodbye, Will. [bouncy, upbeat music] [bouncy, upbeat music] Hey. - Hello. - Hi. - Morning. - Yeah. You sure I don't look silly sitting in the middle like this? You look great, I promise. Okay, ready? So Will, you've been collecting this train set your entire life. At what point did it become a Christmas village? When my house became holiday central, so did the trains. It keeps the kid alive in me, too. Absolutely. The kids that come through on our fundraising tours, this is their favorite stop. Fundraising? Why don't you tell us a little about the charities you work with? Well, the first and key charity I work with is at the Union Hope Shelter. That's downtown at Third and Lucas. Look at him go. I guess there is some personality attached to those pecs. Oh, there's definitely more to Christmas Dude than meets the eye. Just takes the right energy to bring it out of him. Of course, on the other hand, we don't want him to get too comfortable. Okay, great! Let's go over here and get some more stuff. Okay. Okay, so... This room is really theatrical. It's almost "The Little Mermaid" meets "A Christmas Story." Yeah, it was really fun to design. It's got kind of a feminine vibe to it for such a manly man like yourself. Wouldn't you say, Will? Well, I just wanted a little something for everyone. What exactly was the inspiration? Truth? Always. I had this girlfriend, and she loved mermaids. I think she thought she was one in a past life. So the idea came from her. Some people think mermaids are kind of sexy. Does this double as a fantasy suite for you sometimes? Well, any room can feel special if you're in it with the right person. Wouldn't you agree, Paul? Works for me. No further questions, your honor. You gave it right back to Paul in there. I got some good advice from a smart producer I know. You should listen to her. So a mermaid girlfriend? It was ages ago... water under the bridge. I just wanted to toss your nosy boss a bone. Good job. Come on, I want to show you something. Okay, so picture all this stuff covering the entire front of the house and you get the idea. Santa's workshop has got nothing on you. Who do you think he calls for reinforcements? Hey, I remember this. This was what you were working on the day of our walkthrough. I was. It's a gingerbread house. My mom and dad bought it for me the Christmas before they passed away. Your last year with them? It was. Anyway, my grandpa and I added a whole bunch of details to it over the years. Maybe we can do something special with it on camera? Absolutely we can. Sophia! Wait five minutes and then come out. Yoohoo! Soph! That was... where were you? Checking out the millions of Christmas things. Will had in the garage. You would not believe all the things he has stashed away in there. Crazy! I cannot wait until we get a shot of him decorating the house. It's going to be insane. I really hope we scheduled enough time for it. Did we schedule enough time? Why are you talking so fast? - Am I? - Yeah. You are. It's just this really strong coffee this morning. Yeah! No matter how much sugar I put in it... In our next hour: this season's hottest Christmas recipes. You're watching KTLA. Hey, Fred. Come to lend a hand? Not on your life. I better not see any of these lights shining before they're supposed to! You know what the injunction says! The lights will be up, not on. It's just for some quick filming. And can I give you a little piece of neighborly advice? And what might that be? How about this Christmas, I don't know. Enjoy yourself? I had it made for you to wear on the show. Try it on and tell me what you think. I love it! Oh! How's it look? Like a million bucks! I think it's amazing. Maybe we need to make it a little tighter? Put it in the dryer? If you hot wash it, we can dry it on your abs, you know what I mean? How are you today? - Doing well, how are you? - Hi, I'm Paul. - Paul, nice to meet you. - Pleasure. So, how do you feel about Will's Christmas extravaganza? It's kind of crazy town for my tastes. He can decoare my bush anytime. I can tell you one thing: I wouldn't want to pay his light bill. No way! What do you think of Will's majestic Christmas wonderland? I hate the whole thing. Oh, is that everything? Yeah, that just about covers it. Great, great. Did we get that? Great, can we try it one more time with a smile? With a smile? I hate the whole thing. So, you happy? Not unhappy. Definite improvement. I'll take it. Are you heading back to the office? No. Home. Wanna stick around? Maybe. You've gotta eat, right? You cook, too? Oh yeah. I cook. No measuring cups or cookbooks. I'm impressed. I just wing it. Usually works out. Are you sure I can't help with anything? I'm sure. All right, I'm on dishes then. Be my guest. So, other than the mermaid wannabe, are there any other serious relationships in your past? A few, for sure. I was actually engaged in college. Really? Engaged. That is serious. Yeah, but we were young and it would've been a disaster. Hit and miss since then, and lately it's just been me and Romeo. What about you? Anyone serious? Yeah, but no one I wanted to go the distance with. The last relationship was a disaster. He was a cheating mess. It kind of tainted relationships and trust for me, so... Want me to kick his ass? No, he was not worth the energy. How did your parents die? Sorry, was that way too personal? You don't have to answer that question. No. It's fine. It was a car accident. Drunk driver. Sorry. How old were you? Eight. Do you have any siblings? Just me. Any other family? No. That's sad. What I've experienced in my life, it's all relative to what you've experienced, what Hank has experienced. The kids from the charities I work with, what they're experiencing. We only know what we know, if we have nothing else to compare it to. Yeah, I suppose so. My grandparents swooped me up, moved me in here, and raised me like champs. I was always loved, that's for sure. Even though I was a pretty challenging teenager. Challenging how? Fell in with a bad crowd. Drugs, booze... Really? Oh yeah. I was a shithead. I even broke into a house once. I hit rock bottom when I was in my late teens. Grandparents kicked me out. Went from one friend's couch to the next. Spent a few nights on the street. Long story short: it was definitely an eye opener. I was lucky my grandparents took me back. Yeah. Worst I ever did was get a week's detention. And I swear, it wasn't my fault! I'm sure it wasn't. [oven beeps] You were lucky to have them - your grandparents. I honestly don't know where I would have ended up without them. So I try to help others the way they helped me. Pay it forward, you know? And keeping the meaning of Christmas alive every day just ties it all together. That's beautiful, Will. I wonder what your grandparents would think about everything that's going on here now? Are you kidding? They'd love it. They were the happiest, chattiest pair you've ever seen. How about your parents? Not the happiest, chattiest pair you've ever met. They were divorced when I was in third grade, so... Will, I have a confession to make. Should I be sitting down? No, it's just... I am not cuckoo for Christmas. I just said it so you would do the show and so that you'd like me. I have something to confess, too. I already knew. Any true Christmas nut could've immediately named their favorite ornament maker. You went generic. But it's okay, really. I won't hold it against you. Well, thank you. Although I'm not sure that I deserve that. My parents. Every year they would argue over who got me at Christmas time. It was a big competition: who had the bigger house, better gifts, fancier vacation, and it made me dread Christmas every year. I still do. Maybe this year will be different. Maybe it will. Who knew he'd look so good on a ladder? Wait! We shouldn't be letting him do that! Yeah, it's not really the best time for our star to end up in a full body cast. This is going to be gold. It'll cut together great! Plus we are insured up the wazoo, so... He's smiley today. Maybe our boy got a little lucky last night. Why do you say that? That glow, it ain't from the Christmas lights. I'll tell you one thing: he loves that t-shirt. And we love him in it. Nice job, Sophia. [gasping] How's that? Did you get what you want? That was scary. That was hilarious, and our cameras caught every second. Great job, Will, that was perfect! He could've killed himself! Sophia, come on! We need a little excitement, some action. Yeah, that you can manipulate. Don't try this at home, kids. Will, let's go again. What is it? What is wrong? You know what? I don't trust Paul. I understand that we're making television here, but there are real lives at stake. Okay, I'm just gonna take a stab here: this isn't about Paul, is it? It's about you and Will. What about me and Will? I asked you first. Oh my god, you slept with him! Shhh! Why didn't you say something? This is... fantastic! When was it? How was it? It was last night and it was off the charts. I'm in it really deep here, Linz. Okay yeah, I mean, maybe this isn't the beset career move for you at this very second, but you'd have to be made of cement not to respond to Will. That doesn't make it right. Look, you deserve to be happy. Just be careful, don't let it affect the work. And... enjoy the shit out of it. Not a peep! You got it, sister. Give us the countdown, man. Three, two, one... Merry Christmas! Hey! Leaving without a goodbye? Goodbyes with you get me in trouble. You won't stay? I can't stay. I understand. I was thinking, if you want, I could help you pick out a Christmas tree this weekend. Like a date? Call it work. Alright. My grandpa and I used to go out after Thanksgiving and chop down our own tree. My biggest thrill was when I was old enough to do the chopping myself. Just a boy and his axe. Until I discovered girls. Lucky us. So, how do I know which one to pick? Which looks best to you? I kind of like that one. Noble fir. Good, traditional choice. How tall? About your height's perfect. You like the shape? Oh, yeah. So symmetrical. Okay, now you have to check the branches and make sure they're soft and pliable and not brittle in any way. There's nothing brittle about this one. Do you always travel with 100 spare ornaments? I just figured, given your humbug history, you'd be a little light in the ornament department. You figured right. Thank you. I grabbed one of my favorites. A movie theater! This reminds me of It's a Wonderful Life. My favorite Christmas movie. So she does like Christmas! I never said I didn't like Christmas. Just aspects of it. Pick a place of honor for the movie house. Perfect. Come here. I'm falling, Sophia. I'm falling for you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are? Can't say anyone has told me I'm beautiful before. No. Romeo - is Romeo home alone? He's with Hank. Can I say that I love that you think about my dog? I think about you. And how lucky I am. That you found me? Well, technically Paul found you. I just... followed up. Remind me to thank him. How about after the show airs, okay? Got it. Hey, wanna maybe go for a hike or something this morning? I can grab Romeo, we can hit up Griffith Park? I'm still thinking low profile is the way to go. Or we could just stay in... That could definitely have its definite advantages. And here we have Frosty, and his little brother, Norman. Frosty is a more appropriate Christmas name, but Norman's still... he's nice. Here you go, hold these edges down. Our man's certainly got charisma, no question. Once we opened him up. Or should I say once you did. Me, you, the crew... teamwork! Mmm-hmm. We still need some more drama, conflict. Chaos. Chaos? We have one more day of shooting. See what you can get. I don't want it to have to be manufactured. Like this... snow. Everything you see here has a history, a meaning, a purpose. So how long have you been collecting all this stuff? I'm 33 years old so... 33 years. Since you were a baby? Well, maybe not that far back. But my first words were, "Santa Claus." Why don't you tell us about this gingerbread house? My parents gave me this incredible gingerbread house for Christmas when I was a kid. I was too young then to know how to put it together, so my dad and grandpa showed me how. And every Christmas since, I've assembled it. Last few years, Hank has lent me a hand. Push in a little bit. Kayla, your boom is in the shot again. -I'm not in the shot! I'm looking through the frame! Kayla, just back up. Well, I can't really back up... Kayla, just put your boom up. Okay, I guess I'm getting up then... [crashing] Okay... no worries, it's all good. No one got hurt. The house can be fixed. Kayla, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just, the house... It's fine. Cut. Is everything okay? Yup. How's the house? Getting fixed. Kayla feels so bad. We all do. If I wouldn't have told her to back up, none of this would have happened. I'm so, so sorry. Sorry about what? I just told you: your house. How about being sorry you kept rolling? Why didn't you stop the filming the second you saw what happened? Listen, I gotta fix this. I'll see you inside. So, do you need a ride home? Don't you live in the opposite direction? Yeah, but I can give you a ride there if you need one, obviously. I guess I can put up with you for a little longer. He's in the garage. I should have stopped rolling immediately. That's not what Paul would say. Yeah, well Paul isn't secretly involved with our lead. [text message alert] - Shit. - What? Oh my God. That's good, but that's not good. That's bad for the show. Who you're with is really none of his or anyone else's business. That's just it, it is his business. And it just looks bad. I mean, I know it wasn't exactly the smartest choice to make, but... I made a choice. Are you sorry you did? No. Are you sorry you decided to do the show? A little. But then I wouldn't have met you... Unless of course we're breaking up? No. I'm an excellent multi-tasker. You are. But I have a show to produce. I have to stay focused, there is a lot riding on it. Like my career. Sophia Worthy... You are one of the most determined, capable, inspiring people I've ever known. You can do it all. I know it. That's one of the sweetest things anyone's ever said to me. I knew I liked you for a reason. I'm sorry I got so intense about the gingerbread house. It meant a lot to you. It's a big part of your past. Yeah, but it's a decoration. You were just doing your job. I should have stopped rolling. And I knew the history of the house, and if it's broken... I'll fix it. That's what I do. [Paul] There you are. I want you to call to this person. Who's Helena Miller? She's a shrink. She's great. Paul, I know I've got issues, but I don't need a shrink. Not for you, for the show. She's great. I want you to set up a sitdown with her. Get her to talk about Christmas, how it messes with people, gets in their head, makes them go nuts. And by people, I'm assuming you mean Will? Sophia, we still need more dimension. Unless you're scared you're going to find out something you don't want to know. I call the holidays my tax season. It's my busiest time. Why is that? Why do you think the holidays are such a difficult time for people? Christmas time is kind of a perfect emotional storm. Another year is gone. What have I accomplished? Who do I have to celebrate with? Why does everybody seem so happy but me? And then there are the childhood triggers that pop up. They can really derail you. Of course. So for example, say if someone wanted to celebrate Christmas every day of the year. What do you think is the deeper meaning there? Two words: disfunction junction. Thank you. Done. That was great. Sophia, this is so wrong. I know, it wasn't my idea. [Will] How is the show looking so far? We have a lot of great footage. You are looking like a major star. Everyone loves Christmas, so what can go wrong? Even I'm getting into it. Yeah? [text message alert] Anything important? My buddy CJ saw a promo for the show. He texted it to me. A promo? You're kidding, I didn't know we had one. Wait... maybe I should watch it first? Why? Are you afraid of something? No, I just... Okay fine, let's watch it. Buckle up this Christmas as Bravada Television presents. "Extreme Holidays" with an eye- opening look at one sexy stud who celebrates yuletide 365 crazy days a year!" Hi, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland! It's kind of crazy town for my tastes. But my kids love it, so what're you gonna do? I wouldn't want to pay his light bill. I hate the whole thing. Uh... It's snowing! Two words: disfunction junction. You've never seen a guy so hopelessly devoted in your life! Catch the series premier, Christmas Eve! I don't know, maybe I'm nuts... Can I do that again? What the hell was that? So you knew about this? Well, I knew they were cutting promos. I didn't know when they were airing. Well, they have to pull it. That's not happening. It has to! Not only does it misrepresent Will, but it misrepresents the show! Okay Sophia, calm down! [groans] The network got ahold of me late last night. The new promos tested through the roof. The network immediately slapped them online, on air... But it's not the show we're making! Well I hate to tell you, but it is. At least it's the tone they want. What about what we want? We want our deal renewed. What if I disagree? Well, you could quit and have absolutely no say in the direction we take. Or you can stay and cut a great show. One that Bravada will really, really love. So you're letting them make me look like a complete idiot on national TV. The one thing I was worried about from the start. I'm going to be there every step of the way and make sure that the show looks as good as it possibly can. Within my power. This was such a mistake. I never should have said yes. Why did you then? The truth? Because of you. I believed you saw something in me that maybe I didn't. So when you told me to trust you, I did. I also feel kind of used. Used? By who? By Paul. And by you. I know how you feel - I do. I was blindsided too. I really don't want this to come between us. It already has. There you go. I knew it was too good to be true. You can't be that surprised by it. I can't? He was a little prickly. Very much his own man, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but there were some red flags flying amid that first-rate hunkiness. There were? What red flags? Well, he's Christmas crazy. That's unusual. He's creative and nostalgic. Not crazy, don't call him that. You know what I mean. I don't know, Linz. He's honestly all-around perfect. It's just your judgment got a little clouded, that's all. I have never felt this way. Ever. Guys like Will don't come around every day. Good thing, because how could we keep up with them all? Will told me that he thought that I saw things in him that he hadn't seen in himself. Honestly, it was the other way around. And I was starting to love him for it. At least I thought I was. Men... Men. Set it down over there. Still haven't fixed that yet? Roof's busted. Long as I've known you, Will, you've never been a quitter. Some things are just broken beyond repair. You talking about the house, or Sophia? What are we if we can't be trusted to do the right thing? People make mistakes, Will. It doesn't mean they can't learn from them, can't change. Yvette and I might still be together if I had just made some different choices. I might know my kids, my grand kids. Just don't be like me, Will. Don't have regrets. Come on - let's fix this old gingerbread house already. You know what? Just give me a sec. Need some help? Damn gophers... One of these days they're going to eat the whole damn mailbox. Maybe you could get an injunction against them? Really is quite the deal you put on there. I don't think I quite realized that until that whole TV show came along. Gotta love those cameras, right? I, uh... I gave them an interview, you know. I saw. Nice work, very quotable. Ginny always talked about how great it was on the inside. I've been missing her a lot this last little while. Feel like a quick tour? Yeah, I'd like that. Don't worry, it will stay there. I don't always succeed, but that's what I try to do. So, how's it going? Good, just trying to decide what to use from this clip. Oh, is this when he waxes poetic about peace on earth and good will hunting, or whatever? Can we please use as little of this as possible? Yeah, it's only his entire philosophy and reason for being. I get it: laughs, gaffes, and thrills. I'm on it, Paul. Look, I know I've been hard on you. But it's because I really want you to succeed. You have real ability, and I want everyone to see it. Okay? So, you going to bring Superman to the Christmas party? That would be a little hard right now. We're not exactly speaking. Oh. Is that because of the show? The show. Expectations. Trust issues. And don't date the talent: you were right. Well, I had to learn that one the hard way. But then I married the guy, so... It's not always a trainwreck. [hammering] - Sophia... - Will! I was just... getting a latte. Medium nonfat, half-caf, no foam... teaspoon of agave. Good memory. - So how've you been? - How've you been? How's Romeo? Excited to see you. Yeah, I miss him too. The show is looking really good. Paul was asking me if you would do publicity for it, but I assumed it was a fat "no." Whatever the opposite of publicity is, that's what I'll be doing. I fixed the gingerbread house. Looks almost good as new. That's really good. Well... Merry Christmas, Sophia. You too, Will. Bye Romeo. Hey. I just downloaded some extra B-roll that must have got lost in the shuffle. You should check it out. Okay. Thanks, I will. File's named "New." [Hank] You know, Will he's like, he's this tall, good looking young man. You wouldn't expect it, but he's got a heart of gold. And uh, I just love the guy. And uh, I just love the guy. It was probably my favorite Christmas present of all time. High five! Hey, I got your text, what's up? Bravada moved up the viewing meeting. It's in two hours. Two hours? No, it's not for two days! Bentley has to leave town tonight, wants to see a cut in person, with us. No, it's nowhere close to being ready... It's not like they haven't seen footage already. They cut promos, remember? They're expecting rough. How rough is it? I mean it's long, but watchable. Fine, just wrap it up. Paul, I've been meaning to... I don't have time. I need to crunch numbers with Lindsey before the meeting. - Okay. - Thank you. Our goal is to launch with a subject and a situation so unique and strange, yet relatable, that it will set the bar for an entire year of extreme holiday madness. At the same time, we've tried to split the difference between sentiment and sensationalism. Entertaining, but authentic. And I think you'll agree that we have found a major star in Will Saunders. Let's see what you've got. Of course. Hi, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. Hi, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. Welcome to my Christmas wonderland! This shirt sucks. Hey, I'm Will Saunders and welcome to my Christmas wonderland. You sure I don't look silly? I love that. How's it look? It's kind of crazy town for my tastes. But my kids love it, so what're you going to do? I wouldn't want to pay his light bill! I hate the whole thing. Will is like this tall, good looking young man. You wouldn't expect it, but he's got a heart of gold and I just love the guy. [Will] Imagine if we could keep the spirit of Christmas, with all its joy and generosity and good will alive all year round. Think how much better off we'd be? I don't always succeed, but it's what I try to do. Wow. That really wasn't like the promos we cut, now was it? Jayla, let me explain... Actually, Sophia, why don't you explain? Well... You know, that won't be necessary. I know what I expected, I know what I saw, and I know how I feel. I loved it. Yeah, those promos that we cut drew eyeballs, but now it is clear that we can't have sustain that broad of a tone for a whole show. Paul, you and your team found the sweet spot in the story. You made it engaging and vivid, without sacrificing the charge of reality TV. Heck, you almost kind of redefined the genre. And just in time for Christmas. Well done, people. Congratulations. We are thrilled that you enjoyed the... I've got a plane to catch! And Sophia? Thank Will for me, would you? It is clear that you really brought out the best in him. Well, that was a surprise. All the way around. I tried to warn you before we went in... It's a good thing you didn't. I probably would have freaked out. Actually, I still might. I was just trying to do the right thing for everyone. Including you. And Will. Not really. He doesn't care anymore. You know what? His loss. Anyway, once we get picture lock, we have to jump on Valentine's Day. Now, I have got a couple of romance freaks, but I want to know what you think. I think... I quit. Great, quit what? My job. Excuse me? I realized in there that this isn't the place for me. I don't want to sneak around behind my boss's back to do what I think is right. What are you talking about? I somehow thought that I could take my love of documentary film and bring it to reality TV. And that was very wrong. What happened in there was a one-off. I got lucky, and I know that. We're going to go right back to chasing ratings. Which is fine for some people, just not for me. I'm sorry, did Will put you up to this? Hardly. If anything, it was you. You're a sharp, talented guy, Paul. But your eye is on the prize, not the passion. Don't worry, I'm going to help you deliver the show on Friday. And if you're thinking about replacing me, consider Lindsey. She's the best. Merry Christmas, Paul. What does Christmas have to do with it? [door knocking] [Sophia] Dear Will, I hate the idea that your last thoughts of me are such disappointing ones. As I got to know the man you truly are, my respect and my feeling for you grew and took shape in ways that, honestly, surprised me. Now my greatest wish is that I can be a person you'd respect with equal measure. Even if I never see you again, I want to be a woman who deserves an amazing man like you. Thank you for being that man. Love, Sophia. Welcome to my Christmas wonderland! This shirt sucks. I wouldn't want to pay his light bill! I hate the whole thing. Will is like this tall, good looking young man. You wouldn't expect it, but he's got a heart of gold. I just love the guy. Hi. I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop by. With irises? Yup. So, did you watch the show? I did. And? It wasn't half as bad as I expected. Oh, hold off on the praise, okay? I'm saying I got what you were going for. You tried to keep it real, make me seem okay, but give the audience enough of that dopey stuff they'd need to keep watching. And I know it wasn't what you were told to do, but you did it anyway. I know you did that for me. I didn't do it for you, I did it because of you. Because of who you showed the cameras you were. I didn't go to film school for nothing! And you didn't get in trouble? The network flipped over it. Paul folded like a deck chair. They're already onto Valentine's Day. So that must make you Super Real's new golden girl. Oh, it totally did. I'm happy for you, Sophia. But I quit. You quit? What do you mean, you quit? I want to get excited about what I do. I want solve problems with my art, not make them. Are you sure you know what you're doing? I have no idea what I'm doing. But I am sure about one thing. Oh yeah? What's that? That I really miss you. And I hope you know that, no matter what, you can trust me again. I do. I understand now what you were up against, how much was truly out of your control. What happened wasn't intentional, or personal. Until it was personal. Yeah, I think I remember those. They were pretty good, weren't they? They were okay. Only okay? What are you thinking? I'm thinking... About you, and me. Without all that noise from the show between us. I like that thought. If you'll have me, Sophia, I'm yours. 365 days a year. ♪ It's so easy to forget ♪ ♪ The true meaning of Christmas ♪ ♪ We get wrapped up with gifts beneath the tree ♪ ♪ Though I desire so much more ♪ ♪ There's so much to be grateful for ♪ ♪ I finally took the time to reflect ♪ ♪ In the night on Christmas Eve ♪ ♪ Before I close my eyes to sleep ♪ ♪ I'm down here praying on my knees ♪ ♪ For love to win instead of hate ♪ ♪ To keep the ones I love safe ♪ ♪ Let the hopeless know somebody cares ♪ ♪ To help the weak stand again ♪ ♪ Give the lost a helping hand ♪ ♪ And heal the sick ♪ ♪ This is my Christmas prayer ♪ ♪ I'm here asking you ♪ ♪ Because this is more than I can do ♪ ♪ You're the giver of all hope ♪ ♪ Make it recur ♪ ♪ Through the dark, we'll shine our light ♪ ♪ With your love all hearts unite ♪ ♪ Carrying your peace everywhere ♪ ♪ Help the weak stand again ♪ ♪ Give the lost a helping hand ♪ ♪ Heal the sick ♪ ♪ This is my Christmas prayer ♪ ♪ This is my Christmas prayer ♪
