No, no sweetie, the elevator's broken, we have to take the stairs. Come on, let's go. I have to work late again today, okay honey? Okay. Ah, now you know what to do, you just stay at school, don't go home with anybody else, just wait for me. Hurry. Yes. Ah, your lunch, I left it upstairs. God, I can't be late for work again. Okay, I'm gonna run upstairs by myself, you just wait here. Don't go outside, don't talk to anybody, I'll be right back. I'm running late but I'll be there as soon as I can. Yeah fine, bye, thanks. Okay Carla, we're outta here. Sweetie. Carla? Carla? Carla? Carla. Carla! Yeah, it's Jack. Jack, it's Paula, SST called. I knew it, that's a good sign, don't you think? I think you should worry about it after you get back from vacation. This is not the time to disappear for a week, I really wanna close these guys. What about Kate, don't you dare even think about canceling with her again. She's totally organized this trip. You have done nothing. Paula, when have I had a chance to plan a vacation? I'll see you in a few minutes. You're coming back to the office? Oh hi John, look, I'm going on vacation for a week, will you garage it for me? You got 'em champ, you got 'em! What did I tell you, did we do it? Close, we got one small hurdle, Saros, the CEO, he wants to meet us. I think it's a formality, but we gotta go through with it. If you make this sale, this is gonna be the biggest deal we're ever gonna make! Let me call him now, I can close him. No, no, no, no, patience. - I knew I can close him. Come on! It's all scheduled, tomorrow night, we relax, we have drinks, you give 'em your pitch, and then we close 'em. Tomorrow, I uh-- What's wrong? Well I, I was on my way out. I'm suppose to be on a plane tomorrow morning. - Well you're not still goin' are you Jack, you gotta be there. Believe me, I wanna be there, it's just that, I made a promise. To Kate? Yeah, well-- - Oh Jack, come on, you know her, she's been through this before, she's flexible. - I know, I know, but-- Well it's your call but, we got a relationship with these guys now. You want me to call 'em back and cancel, I can do it. It's gonna kill me to do it, but I'll do it. Jack. If, if, if it's any consolation, in three days Kate's gonna be there, SST won't. Hi. Hi. Five minutes, I'm walking out the door. I know, I know, is this for me? Yeah, open it, it's for the trip. Aw Kate, you didn't have to do this, you've already planned the whole trip. Um, maybe I should open it later. I can't go on this trip. You're joking, right? No, I'm not joking. Oh my god, I told myself I wasn't gonna do this-- We'll just postpone it for a few days. Honey, this is a major, major-- No, no, I don't care. I took the time off. I know you, in a few days it'll be something else, and then something else after that. This is the sixth time this has happened. Oh god, why a, why am I always the one waiting for you? I wait for you to call, I wait for you to come over. Why does everything revolve around you and your schedule? Kate, I'm busy. I told you when we met, building a business from the ground up takes time. You're selfish. I am not selfish. So, how are we tonight? Scotch and soda. If it was you, I'd understand. Oh well, I'm sure you would. - It's the same battle all the time, it's always about work. Jack, it's not about work. We've known each other for three years, I still feel like I'm dating you. If this relationship is important enough to you, you either tell them no, or, or then well, it's over. - Oh no, no, don't do that to me, don't put me in a position of choosing. Oh, wh-why, because you don't wanna make a decision? Kate, you want an answer? - Oh, so I just win by default is that it? - Is that what you want, an answer? - Yes, I would love an answer from you. - Okay, I'm not going. I can't go, it's too important. I need this, they need me, and that has nothing to do with how I feel about you, nothing. Jack, I don't know how you feel about me, I don't. I don't understand the problem. You don't give, that's the problem. You know, I'm going on this trip without you, don't bother coming. Would you like to see a menu? Hello! Hello. Ah, taxi! Hey! Train arriving on track one for Prospect Square and Evansville. Excuse me, is that seat taken? Yes, it is. Uh miss, uh, you dropped your doll. Hey, uh. Uh, stop the train. Stop the train! Somebody wanna tell somebody to stop the train! You have to stop the train, hey, hey! Come on man, if you missed your stop-- No, no, I didn't miss my stop. There was a little girl, she was, she was just on the train here and, and she got off, on the poster here, the same girl. Now what're you talkin' about? This girl, right here-- Hey. - She was on the train, and she got off the last stop and uh, she was with a lady, she dropped this doll. I, I saw her. Are you sure? Did anybody see her? She was just on the train here, did anybody see? I'm sure she, that's the number, we should call this number, right? Yeah. Carla McKillin. No, McKillin. Are you sure? She was with a woman in her 30s. If she's not in your computer, how come the posters are still up? Huh, come on, man you gotta take 'em down. You're causin' a lot of unnecessary panic down here. Yeah. All right, you too. Found. Found? Are you sure? Yeah, she's not in the computer, they said she must've been found. Said they didn't have time to take the posters down. Right, that's great well, that's yours. No, no, whoa, whoa. No uh, see this is not my job. I'm with the transit authority. What does that mean? It means, you gotta take this to the transit system lost and found, now that's department A, the Metropolitan Building. Wait a second, this is gettin' too complicated. Just, I'll tell you what, we'll just uh, put it right over here, all right? We'll just leave it right there on the bench and I'm sure they'll probably come after it, don't you think? Well, whatever you feel is right, it's entirely up to you, sir. I'm sure it'll be all right. I mean if it were an expensive item, I'd send it in, but it's just a doll, right? It's probably gonna get thrown in the trash, man. Paula, that doll has been here all day. I thought you were gonna take care of this. I didn't wanna send it to lost and found, she might not know to look there. But there was only one McKillin in the book, so I called, she wasn't there, but I have her address, it's 442 Glasgow. Well fine, just put it in a box and mail it to her. You know what, she lives on your way, why don't you drop it off? Drop the doll off, why would I do that? Just send it to her. Boy, you sure don't know how traumatic it is for a little girl to lose her doll, do you? Well I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble relating. Look, the dinner with SST is in two hours, why make this so complicated? But you have time. Just think about what this little girl has been through. Paula, I'm not asking you to dismember it. Just put it in a damn box and send it to her. I can't even believe I'm discussing this, I think I'm being a pretty nice guy just to have you send it. Hi. You can use it for tonight. It's great dinner conversation, gosh, I'm sorry I'm late, I was just returning this doll to a poor little child. And you guys think I'm cynical? By the way, did Kate call? No, was she suppose to? Just see if you can get me on a flight to Antiqua in the morning, please. Ohh, if I have time. Down to $520. All right! How's that? Great, thank you. Great, okay, let's meet your new challenger, shall we? Hi Calvin. Hi Ann, nice to meet you. Thanks. We're glad to have you on our show. Now tell us a little bit about yourself, would you? Well, I'm single, I've lived in the Denver, Colorado-- Gail, I think I know this one, it's the duckbill platypus. Oh I'm sorry Jerry, the answer there is beaver. Oh Christ! - The answer is beaver. Ann, your category... Excuse me. Thank you. Oh my god, where is she? Where'd this come from, who put this here? There was a guy who was just there. Oh my god, he has my daughter, help! Somebody, call the police! Hurry up, come on, stop him! There he is. Hey, hey, hey look, stop, stop! Get outta the car. Wow. Who are you? Get outta there. Who are you? Who are you? Hey, hey, hey, hey. - What have you done with her? What have you done with her? I don't know what you're talking, you wanna put the bat down? Does somebody please wanna call the police? Hey, what did he do? He kidnapped her kid. I didn't kidnap anybody, who are you people? Where's Carla McKillin? How would I know, I, I don't have her, she's with her mother. I'm her mother! You're not her mother, I'm leaving. No, no, not til I know. - Get him over, get him over. - Please don't let him go, - Don't touch the tie. please don't let him go! - Don't you touch my, let go of my tie. - Now get him on the side! Keep him here, please don't let him go. - Don't touch the tie, let go of my necktie! - Please keep him here. - Hey, let go of me! Keep him here. Terry, I'm at the police station. The police station. Don't ask me to explain right now, are they there? Oh that's great. Oh, well you know something about the system, don't you? Excuse me, how long do you think this will take? You're not goin' anywhere. I want you to get off the phone until we straighten this out, okay? I, I've gotta go, I, I gotta go. You're on your own. Both of you, please. I'm Detective Hopkins, this is Alan Dunlap. Alan's with the Child Recovery Foundation that you contacted last night. Hello, we're trying to unravel what happened. There's evidently been some kind of malfunction in the computer. I don't know how or why, but Carla's file was not in the computer system last night. What do you mean it wasn't in the computer last night? Somehow her file was deleted. Whoever took the call probably didn't find Carla's name and just assumed that you were the woman on the train. Carla was presumed found. Mr. Bauer was just returning a doll that he found on the subway. You mean he called and reported it and you didn't do anything about it? Yes, please understand. She's only been missing two weeks. Wouldn't somebody remember if she was found or not? Unfortunately, we have hundreds of children reported missing and found every week. Names get put in, taken out. We're gonna have all the information on Carla back into the system as soon as we possibly can. This um, woman Carla was with, where'd they get off? Uh, well, uh 6th Street. Did you get a description? She was about 5-10, had brown hair, thin. She was wearing a green coat. Anything else? Scars, any distinguishing marks? Matter of fact uh, she had some scars on her wrist. You mean tracks, needle tracks? I'm not sure. There's a lot of drugs in that area, you know. Uh this woman did she look like a user, prostitute maybe? I don't know, I, I suppose she could've been, uh-- Wouldn't you know? Wouldn't it occur to you that something might be wrong? Well I wasn't down there doing detective work. My car was garaged, I happened to be on the subway, I was just trying to get home! She's not here. Does this fit your description of her? No, the eyes are too round, they were more, you know, um-- Oval? And the chin is too square. All right, give it another try. Francis. What happened? I don't know, there was a computer malfunction, file wasn't there. Alan. We're looking into it. Is that the mother? Yes. Mrs. McKillin, I'm Francis Haynes, a fundraiser for the foundation. I just wanna assure you this has never happened to us before, and it will never happen again. And we will do everything we can to get your daughter back. All right. Excuse me. You must be the man on the train, my apologies. Uh, Jack Bauer. Jack Bauer, you look familiar. Any relation to Tim Bauer? He's my father. Is that right, you're kidding, I know your father. You played football at Dartmouth, quarterback. Uh, yes. I'm an alum, Francis Haynes, child recovery's one of my pet projects. I thought you looked familiar. Uh, uh, the, uh, uh, um, what'd they call you? The Scrambler, right? Oh man, so uh, you never wanted to go pro, huh? Well yes, I did, my knees didn't. How's that, better now? Yeah, it could be. Okay, that's it, you can go now. Nice meeting you. I guess we're done. Oh Mr. Bauer, stay out of trouble, champ. We have one of our volunteers here'll take you bath back. Oh, that's okay, I'll take a cab. No, nonsense, let him drive you back, and say hi to your dad for me, will you? I will, thank you. I'm parked just outside. Just so happens I normally work nights at the lab. They called and said it was slow and I should take the night off. Then Alan Dunlap called and said they needed a driver. So you work for child recovery too, Mr. Uh-- Peter Harmon, no, no, no, I'm a part time volunteer, try to help out when I can, do a little bit of everything, you know, put up posters, man the phones, driver. So you met Alan Dunlap. Yeah. Alan's the head of the agency, he started it. Really? Yeah he, really believes in it. Complicated man, very intense. Lost his own daughter five years ago. What happened? They never recovered her. Hi. Hi, are you Laura? Yes. I'm Mary, um, your neighbor said you lived here and I live three blocks from you. I heard what happened last night. My daughter's missing too. She disappeared three weeks ago in Castle Park. I, I left her for just seconds and she was gone. Two months ago, there was another abduction near us on Crestline. A 3-year-old boy, we both went to the police, they said it's a coincidence. That's him. I don't know how you feel about these kinds of things but I went to a psychic last week, and he saw my little girl. She was safe, and she was with a woman. Maybe you could see her and-- I don't think so. But we could help each other, we could put their pictures together on the same flyer and canvas the streets. Look, it's hard enough looking for my own daughter. I'm a waitress, I work during the day and when I'm home I'm out on the streets looking for her. Looking for somebody else's child, I, I, I don't know if I can do that. How do you know there's any connection? I don't, but I know you can't do this alone. Who's helping you? No one. This man who saw Carla, he knows what this woman on the train looks like, maybe he can help us. He won't. Do you know him? He won't. The whole dinner, you didn't talk about the system at all, what did you talk about? Nothing, it was awful. Jack, you know computers, I don't. The good news is they wanna meet again. Drinks Thursday at 6:00, now is that okay? Yeah, fine. You sure? - It's fine, it's fine. You're not gonna pull another Gandhi on us and decide at the last moment to do good works in the city, right? Paula. Book me on a flight to Antigua on Friday now. Messages? Yeah, right here. Kate call? Nope. Jack. Here is the itinerary, why don't you try calling her instead of asking every half hour if she called. Oh, she'll call. I'll wait. Antigua Inn. Kate Lydon, please. Uh do you have the room number, sir? Well I don't know what room she's in. Just a moment, please. Thank you. Yeah. Hello. Hello. I'm sorry, they've connected me with the wrong room. I think, who's this? Uh, this is Andrew, who's this? Andrew? Hello, hello. Kate? Jack? You want business or first class? I'm gonna take off and go home. Now, are you all right? You really oughta take a look at it. I'll been waiting for your call. Excuse me. Hi. Hi, excuse me. Uh, hi, child recovery gave me your phone number where you work, I hope you don't mind. This is Mary Conley, she lives in my neighborhood, her daughter is missing too. Hi. - Hi. Uh, I wanna ask you a favor. Would you go with us on the subway and help us look for the woman you saw on the train? Me? Well uh, what's that gonna do? You know what this woman looks like, all we have is a description. Maybe she lives or works in the area. But I don't really know the area. We do, you can come with us. Well look, if the police want me to get involved, I-- They're not gonna ask you to do that. What would they ask you to do that? I don't know. Look, I think I did what I was suppose to do. I sympathize with your situation, lady. - I don't want your sympathy, I want your help, just this one time, please. I think we should split up. I'll go back towards the subway. Uh, why don't you take this side of the street, I'll take the other, we'll meet up on the corner of 9th and Main. What do we do with these? Give them to people, pass them out. Hi. Thank you. Jerk. How's your eye? Eh, it's okay. Listen, I'm really sorry about what happened yesterday, I wanna pay you back for the tie. The tie? Your tie that was ripped, it was my fault, how much was it? Oh no, it's all right. No, really, I wanna pay you back, how much was it? It's okay, really. How much was it, please. $90. $90, you paid $90 for a tie? Yeah. Who do you work for? I'm a partner in a computer software firm. We develop technical computer software for businesses, and you? I'm a waitress. Really, where? I don't think you've heard of it. Are you married? Um, no, you? No, no, not even close. I'm sorry, you caught me on a bad day uh, I was involved with someone and it recently just, fell apart. How recent? About two hours ago. I'm selfish, self-centered, uncommitted, and not capable of planning events, other than that, uh-- Miss, I'm sorry, the owner doesn't want flyers up in the window. Sorry, he wouldn't let me up'em up. Hm, great, thanks. I know what they're for. If it were up to me, I'd let you put up as many as you want. That is really ridiculous. Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? Let me talk to him, you want me to talk to him? No. Come on, let me talk to him. I mean how could this been hurting him, it's ridiculous. He's back in the kitchen, but I wouldn't do that, he's not very flexible. Wait here, I'll talk to him, I run a business. What's his name? Joe. Joe, all right. Hi, are you Joe? Who are you? Uh Joe, the waitress out front said you don't want flyers in your window but it's for a missing kid. I don't want anything on my window except my name, and I want you to get out of the way. Well look, can we talk about this reasonably, work somethin' out? Work somethin' out, there's nothing to, I told you to get out of my way. But it's for a missing kid Joe, come on. I want you outta here, would you get out? Hey, it's just flyers. You hear what I said, get out. Hey, come on, don't push. Come on. I told you three times to get out of my kitchen and I meant it. - Hey, hey stop it. Let him go. - Get out, and stay out. Let him go! Are you gonna take him outta here? Yes, just leave him alone. Are you all right? I'm fine. Uh, my glasses. Thanks for your help. You're welcome. I said leave him alone. Do you wanna go? Uh, if you don't mind, it is midnight. Yeah. Do you know how to get home? Um, no. Just stay on this, it'll go back to your neighborhood. Okay, you gonna be okay? Yeah, I think so, thank you for helping me. Yeah, well, you're welcome. Oh, oh. Good luck. - Goodnight. Goodnight. No wait, no, no, this is good now. Jack leaves the doll on the doorstep, he walks to his car, am I tellin' this right, Jack? Suddenly he gets in, this woman and the neighbors surround the car. She thinks he's kidnapped her daughter. Guy gets a baseball bat. - An angry mob corrals him, he's brought to the station, and that's when he calls me here at the restaurant. Ripped my necktie. That's an incredible story. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So you went downtown to return a doll? Yeah. Why did you do that? Just one of those things, it was on my way home. Believe me, I would've much rather been talking software with you. I don't know if Terry told you-- And what's she like? Who, the woman? What was she like uh, she's a waitress, lives near downtown. Really? Well, let's talk software. Let's do it. How 'bout some appetizers? Well here's something I'm concerned about, our printer support and serial communication ports. Any problems interfacing? Serial communication ports, you want me to explain that to Martin? Sure. May I help you, Miss-- Yes uh, I need to talk to that-- Jack? Would you uh, gentlemen excuse me for a moment. Nothing's going to happen, it's all right, look he's coming over here, he's coming over. Thank you. What are you doing here? I told your secretary it was an emergency. What are you doing here? I think I found the woman you saw on the train. And why don't we wait for Jack to come back and talk first about uh-- - I'm standing across the street and I saw her and I followed her for awhile. I saw where she went, she went to this motel, I saw the door and the exact-- I'd love another one of those little quiches. Right now, it's her, I know it's her. She's wearing a green coat, she's tall, thin, she's got brown hair. All right, give me the address, I'll be there as soon as I can. - No, you've gotta come now. I don't know how long she's gonna be there. - I can't come now, I'm in the middle of a meeting, call the police. I can't call the police, I don't know if it's her. So you're not sure. I can't take the chance! Look, I, I'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to wait. You know something, you are selfish. I am not-- Jack, problem? What is it with you, I spent all night with you. Now is not the time, there's no problem. Jack, why don't we deal with this later. I'm talking to him, please. I can come in a couple of hours. My god, how can you say that? Jack, they're waiting, why don't you sit down and let the restaurant take care of this. Sorry, give me a number where I can reach you and I'll get in touch with you as soon as I can, okay. Okay? How can you do this? Sorry, little commotion, all taken care of. Is everything okay, Jack? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Jack. Uh, ma'am. Um I, I lost my train of thought. Serial ports. Of course, how could we forget that. Jack, why don't we uh, uh focus on some of Gary's concerns here. I'm, I'm sorry but, I have to go somewhere. I can't explain, I'll be back as soon as I can, I'm very sorry. Where're you going? I, I don't know, I'll call you as soon as I can, I'm sorry. Hey wait a minute! What? We'll take the car. Look, I sacrificed something very important in there. I'm here, I'm showing up. Don't make me think about it. Now where is she? We'll take the car. This is the room. Are you sure? What do I do if it's her? Who is it? Uh, it's uh, uh, the manager. Who? The manager. Sorry, wrong room. Going uptown, you want a ride somewhere? I'll walk. You staying here? In the area. Well I can't stay with ya. I didn't ask you to. I know, I know. Where are you going now? There's some clubs here near Fifth. Prostitutes work the area. Prostitutes. Look it's none of my business, but you shouldn't be... Wanna get in? She's not here. Scotch and soda, please. I'm sorry that I said you were selfish before. Well you hear something enough in your life, maybe it's true. Women. Yeah, well, can I ask you something? Why are you doing this alone, where's Carla's father? He lives in Texas. He cares enough to be angry, he just doesn't care enough to get on a plane. Who's he angry at? Who do you think? Me. Why? Because it's my fault. Why was it your fault? Because I left her alone, which I never do. I'm usually so cautious, I'm always so careful, especially with her, but, I didn't wanna bring her upstairs because I was late for work. I was worried about being five minutes late for work, it's such a stupid thing. I was afraid that they'd be upset with me for being five minutes late so, I know what people must think. What are they thinking? That I was irresponsible, that I deserve it. I don't think that. You can't blame yourself. What about friends, are they helping? I have made many friends. I mean it's, it's mostly my fault. After the divorce, when we moved here, I became very insulated. It was just us. We had our routines and things we did together. I never felt alone, I was comfortable, it was settled. I don't want or need anything in my life except for her, just her. And I wanna sleep again. We can go. I just wanna use the restroom first. Ashtray. Excuse me, can I have the ashtray. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, you look familiar to me. Really? What's your name? Amanda Brown. Amanda Brown uh, 20 questions here uh, let's see, what do you do for a living? I'm a model, are you in that business? Yeah. What do you do? Well I work with people in modeling, agents and, can I buy you a drink? I don't think so. Sorry, man this place is boring. Look, I live nearby, do you wanna get out of here, uh, I'm sorry, I forgot your name. Amanda. Hi uh, I'm Jack. Good for you. Nice meeting you, whoever you are. Well, could you leave a card or something, we're lookin' for models, hey can I buy you guys a drink? Hey you know this guy, who are you? I just met him. Well just leave you number, okay? What the hell's goin' on, let's go. Hey look, I need to talk to you. What are you doing? On the subway, I saw you on the subway. Hey, where you goin'? Hey, what're you tryin' to do, man? Hey, I just wanna talk-- - Way to go. to the girl, I was just talkin' to her. She's gone. Take it outside. God, Jack. Ah, call the police. You got hit again? Yes. We got a good lead now, we think we know who she is. You think? She's got a few aliases, okay. Uh, Brown, Walton, Johnson. We got an APB out on her. Why don't both of you go home, let us handle this, okay? We'll find her. How's your eye, let me see. It's fine, you know he hit me when I wasn't looking. I got a lot harder knocks than this when I was playing football. Yeah, but that was a long time ago, wasn't it? You wanna do me a favor and drive me home? I broke my glasses. You want me to drive that car? Yeah you just turn the key, step on the gas and it goes. You're sure it's gonna let me do that to it. I could take care of her again, you know that. You just, I could do it if you let me, that's all, you just, you have to let me, okay? I don't know what you want, just, tell me what you want. It's what you want, isn't it, sweetheart? What is it? Is it good? Is it what you gave me last time, 'cause that was good. You, you, you, you want me to pay you for it? I can, I can pay you. Don't be stupid, we pay you. I don't know what you want! Go ahead, this is for you. I, I won't take the subway anymore, I won't. I just, I had to take it once just, just to get there. But, you took care of it, right? Please! Last chance, Amanda. Why are you doing this to me? We won't do it anymore, all right? I mean, I won't tell anybody, I don't even know your name. I won't tell anybody. Jack, come on in, it's okay. Is that her? Yes. Any idea what St. James means? Uh, no. We found the syringe, she OD'd. It's like a drug store in this place, she had a nice little connection somewhere. Landlord said that he saw her with uh, a few different kids these past three months. Kids? Yeah, said that she babysat for friends. It's Carla's. Oh my god. The happy mother was reunited this morning with her lost little girl. Alan Dunlap of the Child Recovery Foundation was there to congratulate her. Officials are still puzzled by the abduction, but for the anxious mother, a happy ending. Hey. We got good news, and bad news. The good news is, SST just called and gave us the contract. Yes! The bad news is, we gotta drink this outta coffee cups, we don't have any glasses around here for god sakes! What kind of operation is this? You did it, champ, you did it! God, how do you do it? You lead a charmed life, you know that? That's, that's great. This is good news. That's good news. Oh this guy is cool. He's cool. Hey, we're havin' a party tonight at Franco's. All the employees, and you will be there, right? Huh, what do you mean, huh? You are going to be there because despite the great lengths you went to screw this deal up, this was your deal, Jack.
