My name is Matt. Today, I'm going to die. But before that, you have to know my story. My story is connected to Mou. It's better you hear about Mou first. Matt, what do you want to bring? Let me take this one. Look at that. That's your room up there. It's cool that you have your own room here. Come on. Go away! Bees approach you because you're sweet. So you have to shout "Bitter!" so they won't approach you anymore. Thank you. I'm Mouretta. I'm Matthew, your new neighbor. That'll be my new room. Your room is right across from my room. That means we're brother and sister. Can we become brother and sister just because of that? Of course we can. WHAT'S WRONG?? I'M SAD They're fighting again? Just don't mind them. Sing. What? Sing to me, so I don't hear them. Matt, you're going to graduate soon. How's the preparation for the German scholarship? Are you going or not? What's wrong? You don't want to leave Mou? Why Mou? Who knows, maybe you don't have the heart to do it, you don't want to leave her. No. Mou, you don't want to apply? It's for smart students like Matt, he can do it. -Mou! -Oh, no! I'm going. Listen to me, Mou. -What? -Mou! Mou! Mou. Mou, I know you're in here. Come and hear me out. Answer me. I know you're in here, Mou, please! Mou, your phone is ringing in the next stall. You don't want to answer it? What's with all this noise? What? Mou? You're here? Then who's in the next stall? I'm sorry, wrong stall. I was looking for Mou. What is it with you? This is the girl's bathroom. Get out! Answer me first. Answer what? What else? -Why did you break up with me? -When were we ever dating? -We were close. -I'm close with all the boys. -But I'm the special one, right? -No, all of them are special. Why is it like martabak, "All of them are special"? -They all are special. Enough! -Listen. I'm embarrassed that people will know this. -Just be quiet! -I'm embarrassed! It's just the two of us. No boy can hear this since this is the girl's bathroom. Except him, maybe. Matt, I'm doing some comparative research. It turns out that the girl's bathroom is clean. Not like the boy's bathroom. What are you doing here? -Comparative-- -Besides that. She didn't say why she broke up with me. Were you guys dating? -No! -No! Okay. You didn't consider me to be your boyfriend? Okay... Dicky, actually... -We're dating. -No! No! You're brother and sister, there's no way you're dating. Okay? No. We just started dating. Right, Daddy? -Right, Mommy. -Daddy and Mommy! Why do you have to address each other like that? You're just like that tabloid story! This is impossible. What was I to you this whole time? So we're in the time zone? -Friend zone. -That's what I meant. Daddy Matt. Why are you so late? You're lucky I came. Then why did you say that we're dating? Have your run out of ideas? Why do you have to get close to a guy like that? Ronnie, Connie, Mony, Dicky. It's actually weird, Matt, that you've never dated anyone before. So? Then why are you the one to give me advice about boys? Because I know you so well. What's that got to do with it? I know what kind of boy is suitable for you. -Like what? -A boy that's the opposite of you. One who's not spoiled, nor lazy, or emotional. The boy who knows what he wants and who doesn't care only about himself. Like you. Why like me? Not spoiled, nor selfish, and knows what he wants. That's you. But not me. Is there another boy in the world like that besides you? Yes, there is. If there isn't, I'll be single forever. Just search for him. -Where? -See? You're spoiled. -Find one for me. -See? You're lazy. -How rude. -See? You're emotional. Because it's really hard to find a boyfriend. Well, it is. That's why you don't have a girlfriend. How can I when I have to take care of you all the time? Really? If there's a girl who wants to be with you, you'd be interested? Why not? -Thank God. I thought-- -You thought what? I thought you were gay. -What are you doing? -Stay still. I don't want to be recorded by you. No! -Stay still. -Mou, no. -Mou, delete it. -No way! That's why you have to sneak a glance when a girl's there. My father's here. If you leave, don't come back! Bye, Dad. I love you so much! Mou, you want to go to my house? It's okay. I'm used to it. MAIL BOX Hi, Mom. Hi, Matt. You smell. Wait! When will Mou come over? I need her help to take pictures of the bouquets. I want to post them. Just serve some food, she'll come. Consider it done. I'll prepare the best food. -But tell her. -Yes. There's a package from Dad. Finally! Okay, Mom. -I'm going upstairs. -Okay. Take a shower! "Dear Matt, I'm sending you... GERMANY UNIVERSITY GUIDE BOOKS - 2018 ...all the books you need. I hope your scholarship exam goes well. There's also book for your mom as a symbol of my longing for her. And something you requested, just for Mou. Love, Dad." -Hey, Mou. -Yes, Matt? There's a package for you from Germany. Where is it? Stop. Got it. A BELATED BIRTHDAY PRESENT HOPE YOUR DREAM COMES TRUE - LOVE, MATT. Thanks, Matt! I got Humans! Yes! My favorite! Mou. MOURETTA - Matt, my Instagram photo is liked by a cool guy By the way, my parents are finally getting a divorce. Hey, Mou. Sorry, I just read your message. Matt, check my Instagram account. My photos have likes and commented by Reza Winata. He loves my photos! -Mou, are you okay? -He said my photos are cool and that I have a keen eye. Mou, do you need me to be there? Have you checked my last post? That one he likes a lot. Mou! Do you want to stay the night here? Or maybe you want to talk? I can come over there now. Okay? Matt. Reza asked me to meet him tomorrow. Is that okay? -Mou! -What? You don't want to listen to me? Fine! Bye! Mou! Mou! -Morning, ma'am. -Hi, Matt. -Is Mou ready? -What? Wasn't she with you? No. We'll measure the corner using the sin/cos formula. Here are some exercises. Do them using the corner difference formula. Okay? Go ahead. MOURETTA - Help me, Matt. I need you! The usual place! Everyone understand? Any problems? Do this exercise. Can anyone do it? Come to the front. Why can't anyone solve this in this school? Come on. Who can do it? -Sir. -Yes? I want to go to the bathroom. Hey, Mamat, don't play games with me. If you want to go, do this first. Okay. Bring the eraser with you. It's correct. So, can I go? Mou. From the beginning... we knew that sooner or later, your parents would eventually divorce. So, don't be sad. But don't laugh, either. Don't be crazy because of them. Matt? How long have you been here? Matt, the poetry of Reza's songwriting, it's so beautiful. There's sadness, and happiness. And there's also some funny bits. It's good. Listen to it. You wanted me to skip school for this? Not only that. I want you to meet Reza. Reza? See? You don't listen when I tell you something. I told you last night that Reza wanted to meet me today. You skipped school just to meet him? You... I'm worried about you. Listen to me. Reza likes me. He expresses it all here. Listen to this! -No way! -Don't be mad. I haven't replied yet. I told him, if he wants to be close to me, you need to give your approval. Right? Approval? So I skipped school just to approve your boyfriend? Yes. Where are you going? School's still on. Here. My mom made this for you. You're acting like you're on your period. Is it enough? Or do I have to add some more? -I'd add a ribbon here for-- -I'm going upstairs, Mom. What's wrong with you two? Are you guys fighting again? As usual, he's cranky. Because I'm close with a boy and I didn't tell him beforehand. That's a lie! She skipped school because of a boy. -Is it true? -No. I went to school. For third period. Bad girl. Oh, I forgot. There's something for you. Sign it, I'll return it tomorrow. Okay. That's the application for the German scholarship. Okay. But don't tell Matt. Because Miss Winda said Matt isn't too eager to go to Germany. Maybe that's because he doesn't want to leave you. Right? Here. Return this to Miss Winda. I've signed it. Okay. -There. -Cute! Matt. -I'm sad. -Why? -You know why? -What? Yesterday, Mou's mom told me that she and her husband are getting a divorce. Yes, I know that. Wait, I'm not finished yet. You know, it bothered me to hear it. Turns out that Mou's mom is the second wife, Matt. Okay, okay. I'm sad to hear that, after all this time, she's been lied to. So, every time her father says that he's going out of town for work, he's actually going home to his first wife. Enough. I don't want to talk about it. Okay? Okay. -Hello? -Hello, Matt. Watch out! Don't act so superior just because you're tall! She bumped me. Matt, I'm at the place where Reza is performing. -So? -I need you here to meet him. Mou, I'm eating. After that I'm going to sleep. Matt, please come. I promise, if you don't like him, I won't meet with him again. Okay. But be honest. Don't lie. If you like him or not, just tell me the truth. Don't lie. Okay? Yeah, okay. Okay, Mom, I have to go. Now? -I have to pick Mou up. -"Pick Mou up"? -You aren't finishing your food? -Later. -Take this. -Okay. -Thanks for the food, Mom. -Hey, hey. Bye. Bye. Matt, he's performing soon. -Mou. -What? -Don't you want to talk to me? -About? About your parents. Reza said whatever happens, they're still my parents. Whether it's the second, third, or the fourth wife... I don't care. I have to live my own life, right? Reza said that? Just forget it. It's not a problem for me anymore. It's nothing. That's him! -Good evening, everybody. -Good evening. He's handsome, right? Just admit it. We're going to perform this song. I'm going to take some pictures. This wonderful And happy feeling It colors the world With love Like the beauty of a rainbow It's not just a dream I want the world full of love Love is laughter Love is happiness Love is a God-given thing It fills the soul How's Reza? He's okay, right? -Yeah, he's okay. -Yes! -But it's still weird. -What's weird? How come there's a perfect guy for you just like that? What do you mean? No boy should like me? That's not what I mean. It's just weird. Are you sure he doesn't have an ulterior motive? I want the world full of love I think we should test him. Test him how? What's wrong with you? You know what. Of course. You asked me here to judge him, right? That means I have to test him, to know if he's suitable for you. To know that he's not a mess like Dicky, bawling his eyes out. We're taking a short break, all right? Matt, this is Reza. Reza, this is Matt. So, this is Matt. Reza. Your songs are good. Thank you. I'm gonna get a drink. You want the usual? Yes. What do you want? -Orange juice. -Orange juice. Okay. -Sit down. -Okay. She's pretty, isn't she? Cute? So cute that you asked her to skip school? No. I didn't ask her to skip school. But she's sad. There's no way I'd let her go to school when she's so sad. Because of her parents? You know why. You have to know, I didn't ask her to skip school. I just kept her company while she was sad. Here's the thing, Matt. She often talks about you. I know you're close. But there's one thing you should know... I don't have any bad intentions for her. I like her. Slow down. You're just getting to know each other, right? Don't get her hopes up. I don't want her to be disappointed. The performance wasn't that bad, right? Bad? It was great! -Seriously? -Yes. I have your photos here. -I'll send them. -Okay, send them later. Okay. Okay, I gotta go back. You two go first, I have to tidy up. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Be careful, Matt. -Okay. Hey! -Hey, what? -So what do you think? So, these are the terms to be your boyfriend? Yes. But can you read me the terms? I forgot them. I'll read it again? "Dear Reza... If you want to be my boyfriend, you have to read a thick novel with me called Roro Mendut by Romo Mangunwijaya. Teach me math until I can score a nine out of ten. And finally, teach me how to ride a motorcycle." What? The terms you gave him are weird! -What's so weird about them? -These terms are torture for me. You know I don't like to read, I'm bad at math and I don't have any desire to ride a motorcycle. Well, that's Reza's challenge. If he can do all that and doesn't feel tortured, then he's worthy to be your boyfriend. I can't even ride a bicycle. -Just learn. -No way! I have Matt. So, why should I learn to ride a motorcycle? I just want to be on the backseat forever! Okay. Maybe a motorcycle is too advanced for you. So, why don't we start with bicycle? Three wheels, two wheels, then we add the machine. Okay, Mou? Use this formula. If this is 3k, find the value of the k. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There's not enough fingers. Let me borrow yours. Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16... 21, 22, 23, 24, 25... Here it is. -It's thick, isn't it? -It's heavy. We can use it for exercise. You can do it. Yes. Keep going. -How can I do this? -You're balanced. Keep going. Don't let me go! I can't stop! How do I stop this? Mou! -Reza, what should I do? -Hit the brakes! Oh, dear! Mou! Oh, God! Come on, stand up. -Why didn't you hit the brakes? -Which one is the brake? This one! Come on, stand up. Come in. What's wrong? Take a look. But your score is better now. If this keeps up, we won't get his blessing until we're old. Blessing from who? Matt. Matt? It's Matt who set out the terms, not me. Matt hasn't dated before, right? What if... we find a girlfriend for him? If he has a girlfriend, he'll be so busy with her that he won't bother us anymore. Is this your ball? Thanks. -Wait, no. -I'm just kidding. Don't be mad. -Matthew. -Retha, Reza's cousin. Reza? Why are you here? Reza and Mou asked me to pick you up. They want to have dinner with you this evening. Mou called you but you didn't pick up. I'm playing basketball. You're not hungry after playing basketball? -Usually, yes. -Then let's eat. -All of us? -Yes. Just ask your friends. But you're paying. -No way. -Then, just the four of us. Do you mind? The four of us? Okay. Okay. I'll wait for you, right here. Okay. -Thanks. -Yeah. Mou won't come. She says she's too tired from learning how to ride a bike. Well, you don't mind if it's only the two of us? No. What's that book? Roro Mendut. Why? Nothing. Just a coincidence. What coincidence? Nothing. Just forget it. You've read it? It's the great classical romance novel. Yup. Roro Mendut and Pronocitro's love story is... -beautiful. -Beautiful. How's Retha? Nothing special. I think she's okay. I think she suits you. Do you think I'm like you? Falling in love in one day. No, right? -Retha. -Let go! -Put it on speaker. -No! Mou! Put it on speaker. -Put it on speaker. -Hello, Retha. Yeah? -No. -Put it on speaker. I'm not that sick. -Put it on speaker. -Then? Mou! Hi. Yes, I know. The library. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Retha, hold on. Mou. Sorry. Nothing. There's nothing wrong. It was just Mou. I don't want a divorce. I can do this. I've been responsible to you all this time. How stupid could I be! I always believed that you were going out of town, all this time! What responsibility? You've lied to me and Mou! Aren't you thinking about Mou? How would she feel if we get a divorce? You think I'm not thinking about Mou? Poor girl. You lied to her all this time. You're her father. It's enough! It was never my intention. Please understand that. I have to take your word, the one who lied to me? I just pray that Mou will never be lied to by a man! -Hi, Mou. -Hi. Mou. Breakfast. -I don't want it. -Tuna sandwich. I don't want it. What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood? -It's all your fault. You're mean. -"Mean"? Yes! Reza has done everything you've asked to prove that he's suitable for me. -But you still won't give your blessing. -Where's the proof? This! I will never get nine! And I'll never finish that Roro Mendut book! I'll never be able to ride a bicycle or a motorcycle! But it's not Reza's fault, I'm the one who's an idiot! Matthew? Yes, ma'am? You're ready, right? Ready for what? Today is your test for the German scholarship. I didn't sign up for that. How come? Your mom has already signed the application. My mom? -Just go to class first. -Okay. -It's all your fault. You're mean. -"Mean"? Yes! Reza has done everything you've asked to prove that he's suitable for me. -But you still won't give your blessing. -Where's the proof? This! Matthew? Answer those questions. You have only half an hour to go. What's wrong? You don't want to leave Mou? I'm sorry for testing you. Why did you change your mind? I haven't even passed your tests yet. Mou's right. I'm out of line and it's not fair for her. But I need you to promise... that you'll take care of her. Matt, Mou is a grown-up. She can take care of herself. You don't know her like I do. She's not as tough as she looks. -Yes, I know. -Do you know that she ran away from home twice? She just up and left. We had to call the police. Look. Mou often feels down due to her family's problems. And she's never able to pour her heart out to them. It's too hard for her. That's why she needs someone to build up her confidence. Can you be that person? Reza, where are you going? Billy is waiting for you. Hold on. It's down a bit this month, boss. How come? There aren't many visitors. Do you still want to work? -Yes. -Billy, here he is. Hey, Rez. Excuse me, boss. How's it going? Sit down. Don't hesitate, just sit. Relax. How's Mou? Are you dating her? MOURETTA - Matt has given his approval of us - Yay!! Good. Then it's time for the next step. Rez... You still want to go to the music school, right? Good boy. -I'm going, Bill. -Are you sure? I'm going, Gra. I like this photo of you. -Really? -Yes. The lighting is spot on. And this one, too. -He ignored my call. -Seriously? Why don't you call him? Maybe he'll answer. Let me try. His cell phone is switched off. What's wrong with Matt? He doesn't want to be bothered? Is he even serious about dating? We aren't dating yet. So, you're not dating yet? I have a lot of girlfriends. What a cocky boy. Mou? This is unusual. Usually, it's the brother who picks up his sister. Now it's the opposite. We're going. -Okay. -Bye, Matt. Why didn't you take Retha's call? And mine, too. I was playing basketball. Can I gossip while playing basketball? I'm just asking, you don't have to be clinical. You mean "cynical"? Clinical means something else. Yeah, I know, you're smarter than me. Everyone knows that. -Why are you mad? -Because you're uncertain. Uncertain? Whether you like Retha or not. It seems like she likes you, but you ignore her. Okay. So, where's the problem? Who do you like? Retha? Or someone else? Why does it matter to you? You matter to me. Especially now that you're going to Germany soon. Says who? Don't bother yourself about it. I can't help myself. If you go, who will I be with? Reza. Why are you crying? Are you crying? How did you get here? Let's go home. I'll take you home. Okay? Let's go. These meatballs are delicious. No wonder you and Mou always come here. That's right, we used to come here when he had a food cart. He used be parked on the side of the street. So you used to come here, just the two of you... Just like us, right now? Yeah. Yeah. Mou always sat where I am sitting now? Yeah. Right there. You want to try mine? I mean, my meatballs. I mean, the food in my bowl. You want to try it? Okay. Okay. It's good. Reza! -What are you doing here? -Taking pictures of you. Sit down. Why didn't you tell me that you're coming here? Are you busy? -No, but... I can be prepared-- -Candid shots are good. Like this. Rez. Shit. -Billy. -You have company. -This is Billy, Mou. -Hello. -Hello. -So, this is Mou. Billy. -Reza told me a lot about you. -Told you what? He said that all his songs are inspired by you. Really? Yes. What are we doing? Let's celebrate! Wait. -Celebrate? -Celebrate what, Bill? Gra! -Celebrating what? -I don't know. He's being weird. Gra! Fin! Prepare that thing that we've discussed. That person is there. -Okay. -Okay, Bill. Okay. What are we celebrating? Your career, your future, your friendship, maybe more. -Where did you come from? -From my house. -I wanted to take pictures of Reza. -I see. She didn't tell me. Here it is. What's this? A special menu? Very special. A toast to our future. How does it taste? -It's good. -Just drink it all down. Relax, it's alcohol-free. Reza, use this. No one needs to know you're the one doing this. Just take it. Have fun! How long has he been in there? A half hour, I think. Rez! So, you've done it? -Where is it? -Still inside. -I'll take her home. -Okay. Hey! After the video goes viral... break up with her. Fin. Don't watch it alone. Hop on, hurry. That's it. What's he doing? Go after him. -Go back, Bill! -Go back, Bill! -Ma'am. -Can I help you? Someone had an accident in Kebayoran. Where's the patient? The deceased has been moved to the morgue. -Deceased? -Yes. MORGUE Matt, Reza is gone. Where's Reza? He's okay, right? Yes. He was here. He brought that flower. He said he had to do a recording, so he had to leave. Matt. Yes? Yes? Please, go to Mou's father's house. Tell him about her condition. Okay. -Good evening. -Yes, good evening. -Is Mr. Wisnu at home? -Mr. Wisnu? He's inside, please come in. Thanks. Please sit down. I'll go get him. Okay. What's wrong with you, Mom? -Billy, where are you going? -That's Dad's job! -Sir. -Matthew. What's wrong, Matt? What are you doing here? So, Mou doesn't know about Reza? Not yet. I haven't found the right time. You're right. She might be upset if she knows. Yeah. It's best that you hold on to Reza's phone. In case Mou calls. Here, have some more. -I'm still chewing. -That's okay. -There's still food in here. -It's only apple. Wait. Here. Poor him. Seriously. -My mouth is over here! -Sorry. MOURETTA - Za, when will you come back to Jakarta? I'll be able to go home tomorrow. Soon Yay! Send me your pictures of Bandung, please. Hey, you! You bastard! I know what you did! You used Reza to harass Mou. What did she do to you? Mou and her mom have ruined my family! She knows nothing! She doesn't know anything. She also doesn't know what it feels like to save your own mother... many times, from trying to commit suicide. Does she know that? Stay away from her! We're not finished yet! I miss you so much. Come in, Mom. -Ret! -Hey, Mou. Hi. -What are you doing? -Just looking at some photos. -So, you're better now? -Of course. But take it easy. You just got out of the hospital this morning. I know, I just can't stay put. Hold on. Yes! Reza will come back in a week. Let's just go to Bandung to meet him. With Matt! The four of us, like we used to. Come on! What's with that look? Za, I want to go to Bandung to meet you, with Retha and Matt. So your name is Reza now? Why are you the one replying to my messages? Where's Reza? Mou. Listen to me first. You lied to me! All this time, I'm texting you, not Reza? And you pretended to not know that, and I look like a fool! I want to chat with Reza, not you! Why did you lie to me? -Reza's gone. -Gone where? With who? And why didn't he tell me? And why didn't you tell me? Why did you lie to me, too? -It doesn't matter anymore. -Why not? -Listen to me. -Why not? -Explain to me where Reza is! -He's dead! He passed away. I... Oh, my God! -Mou. -Don't touch me! Mou. Mou. Mou, I'm sorry. Please. Don't touch me! Mou, listen to me. Why didn't you tell me that he's gone? You lied! You lied to me! It wasn't my intention. -You lied to me! -Mou. -You lied to me! -Mou. Mou! Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. -You don't need to cry over him. -Stop! He was the one who lied, not me. -Stop! -He's a crook. Go away! Just get out of my life! Mou. Don't bother me anymore. Mou! Retha, we need to stop. Stop what? Stop lying. I know. Reza asked you to get close to me, right? You like to read Roro Mendut because Roro Mendut married Pronocitro... and lived happily ever after? Yes, Matt, because of that, I love that story. Roro Mendut's story is so tragic. And... they both die. Okay. I lied about reading the book, but... But... I didn't lie about my feelings for you. All right, we will give you one minute to collect your thoughts and then we will begin. Okay. Want to know more? I'll be waiting for you at the rooftop of the Morris building now. Sa. If anything happens to me today... you guys have to take care of Mou. -Where are you going? -The rooftop of the Morris building. I told you... we're not finished yet. Where's the video? Are you high? Or just stupid? There's no way I'm giving it to you that easily. So, why did you ask me to come? That's a good question. Even if I can't hurt Mou directly... at least I can hurt the person she loves the most. Now, we come back to this moment. You know my story now, right? For those of you that love a moral lesson, here's one from me. Don't be an idiot like me and insist on fighting when you know that you'll lose. Look me in the eyes! I'll leave you with more bruises than I have! Fight me if you're brave! Matt! -Come here! -Mou! It hurts! Billy! Matt. -Matt. -Matt! -Matt! -Matt. Why are you lying around? You have an interview to give for that German scholarship. I just got beaten up! -Hurry, get up! Help him up. -What's wrong with you? It's your own fault. Go! -Seriously? -Of course! -What are you looking at? -Come on. -Go! -Come on! Matt! Mou, someone's here for you. How was the scholarship test? It went well. Good, then. I've checked the video. There's nothing on it. Reza wasn't lying. Let's not talk about this. I don't care anymore. I don't even care if there's something on it. You don't need to think of me or take care of me. I've finished reading Roro Mendut. It's good, isn't it? It's a tragic love story. No wonder you like it. Then you'll ride a bicycle after this? What for? We have motorcycle taxi here. -Don't be mad at me again. -Who's mad? You're mad now. I'm mad... because all the men in my life have lied to me. Dad. Reza. Matt. I'm sorry. Before you apologize, I've already forgiven you. But it's not the same anymore. I'm tired, I'm going to bed. Good luck in Germany. -Hi. Is everything ready? -Yes, Mom. I'll make you a sandwich first. Okay. Mou's not coming? No. Why? Matt, bring your backpack here. Okay. -Hey, Mou. -Hi. -Matt's leaving now. -I know. Don't you want to send him off? You do it. Here. I wanted to give it to Matt, but you should give it to him instead. I think Reza made it before the accident, but there was no time. Well, I'll go back to Matt. -Bye, Mou. -Bye. Thanks, Ret. Yeah. Sir, please don't drive too fast. -Be good. -Yes, Mom. -I love you. -I love you, too, Mom. Bye. Love you. Yeah. Bye. Mou? You're too late, darling. Matt! Matt! Matthew! Matt! Matt! Matthew! Stop! Matt! Yes! Red light! Thank God! Matt! Matt! God, why is my life like this? Matt! Sir, can you stop there at that beverage cart? I'm thirsty. Matt! Let me handle this. Hey! What are you doing? Communicating with God. Sorry, but first, can you help me get up? Yeah. Come on. You had to ask what I was doing down there? Slowly. From home? With a bike? What do you think? I'm here to... Here. I wanted to give you a letter from Reza for you. "Hi, Matt. I apologize. If you're reading this letter, then you know what happened. Who I really am and what I did to Mou. I'm sorry, Matt. You said Mou needed someone who can build up her confidence. And I said that I was the one. But it's actually you. Mou's brave in the face of her family's troubles because of you. It has always been you, Matt. Again, all I can do is apologize. Reza." You asked Reza to take care of me? Yes. I'm an adult. I can ride a bike now. You mean that collision? You're right. But I'm mature enough. And you have to go live in Germany. As long as you're here, I'll never grow up... because you'll always be taking care of me. Right? That's why I pretended to be angry. -So, you're not mad at me anymore? -No. Thanks. -Just go or you'll be late. -Yes. -But not too fast! -Hold on! Wait a minute, okay? What are you doing? Answer it. -Hello? -Hello, Mou. Hello. So, you can ride a bike now? Of course. Actually... I want to tell you something. -Look over there. -Why? I can't say it with you looking at me. Just look over there. Look over there. In the distance. I... I love you. Don't laugh. I'm embarrassed. Seriously, don't laugh. -Why are you laughing? -What? Say it one more time. -Why? -I didn't hear it. I love you. And you? Look over there. -You have the same response, right? -Just look over there. I love you, too.
