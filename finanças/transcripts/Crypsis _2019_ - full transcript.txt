Oh my god! Oh my god! No! Get away! My uncle passed away and he left behind this sketch book. He wrote about Harker Island, and some sort of creature they stumbled upon. I want to know what I've found. There was this one sketch that was a little bit strange. It was this figure. You know, I got a couple guys that might be interested. One is already too many. It sounded like a monster. Just like a monster of some kind, just like a monster. Is it all right if I bring my girlfriend along? What was that, what was that? What was that? Be 32 bucks. - $32 for four beers? - Look buddy, I pour the drinks, I don't make the prices. - Yeah, well, that's robbery, so you know. - We got ourselves a regular Frank Sinatra over here. - I totally could. - What? - Serenade a girl. I've been practicing, check it out. Light up the volume. - Oh god. Mic check. ¶ Oh girl, you have a nice backside ¶ ¶ Baby please don't turn around ¶ - Dude, you totally suck, like big time. - Yeah, coming from the virgin. - Oh. - What? What, me? - Ho, ho, ho, ho. - No, no, no. - Hang on a second. - Don't listen to him. - No, no, no. - No what? Let's look. Oh, he is. No, no, get up, dude. - Hey, I was a virgin when I was like 14. - 14? - No seriously, you are a virgin? - Dude. - Even I've gotten laid. - Hookers do not count. You bought a hooker? - Look, that's not how it went down. I didn't pay her, not a dime. - He gave he an Applebee's gift card, and begged for an hour. - Still, not a hooker. - Gentlemen. We got a bet, or what? - You and this stupid bet, man. - Yeah, what is this-- - This guy was parked outside of a Chuck E. Cheese, luring kids into his cars with Twizzlers. - I'm up for a good bet every now and then. - You are? - No, you're not. - Yes, I am, as a matter of fact. - Okay, well listen. When you're good and ready to show me some money, I'll be happy to oblige. Ooh. - Quite a bit of money, man. - You're nuts man. - You're nuts. - So, us three verse them two in the woods. - Why do I get stuck with Ethan? - Would you rather the virgin? - I'm not a damn virgin. - Oh you are so a virgin. - Enough already. - All right, hey, what's wrong with those teams? - I mean, it's just. - Whoa, whoa, let's get one thing straight right now, okay. I have more survival skills in this pinky than these three clowns combined. - Whoa, says who? - Seriously buddy, I mean, you stub your toe and you need a doctor. - That was one time, there was booze involved, and it was a hot redhead, okay? - Let's make it interesting, Harker Island. - Whoa, no way, look, it's closed and off limits for a reason. - You guys know the stuff they say about Harker Island's BS, I mean, come on. - Yeah, urban legends. How do you know? - What, you believe it? - I mean, can't we do this somewhere else, like, anywhere else? - Sure, let's just do it in someone's backyard. - Screw it, I'm in, let's go. - Yeah, you would. - Can I help it if I got a bigger sack than you? - Oh, so it's gonna be like that? All right, Mr. Elephant Balls. - Count me in, too, that's three. - I think majority rules on this one. Says who? - Says me, come on. Tell you what, first team to record more wins, simple as that. - You know how to use that thing, right? - Yeah. - All right. - Hey, did you see what we have to do? - I sure did. - You realize I can't do any of these, right? Yeah, tell me something I don't know. - Hey, Kyle. Yeah. - How we gettin' to the island? - I brought my buddy Ian's boat. - Yo, buddy? - A buddy. - You just said buddy. I got buddies, I, I got guys, I've got friends. - And how big is this boat? - Big enough. - It's not gonna sink, right? - Look, it's not gonna sink, okay, and we're not gonna go in the ocean, it's gonna be fine. Brandon, catch. - Sweet. - All right, listen, one more thing before we go. Cell phones. - What, no, dude come on. - Cell phones? - Look, there's money at stake, okay. I can't have you guys calling your sisters or your wives. Fork 'em up, fork 'em up, you'll get 'em when we get back. - All right. - Okay. - I only use it for emergencies. - That's what I'm saying. - You sure? What is this, 2001? - Hey, what? - Okay, give me, I'll take a message. - All right. - All right, come on. - To call aliens. - Why are we even still here? If we're gonna do this man, we need to leave now. - Okay, all right, fine, we'll go. - Let's do it. Hey, turn that thing off, don't waste the battery. - I can't do this. - What is your freakin' deal? You've been freakin' out since we left. - I'm not doin' it, bet's off! - So are we good, or what? - Yeah, yeah, we're good, we're good. Look, everything is going to be fine, all right? Trust me, okay, just stop. Okay? - What's his deal? - I don't know, I really don't know. - Hey, you can't talk to him anymore, he's the enemy now. - Okay, okay, I see how it is, screw you guys. Have fun spooning each other later on. - Spooning, what's spooning? - Oh, god. - Hey you, would you stop screwin' around, come on, we got work to do. Oh, I hate my life. - Brandon's not back yet? - Nope, he probably got lost, knowing him. Hey um, you know how to do like, you know, the knots, the cub scout knots? - Cub scout? - Yeah. - You mean boy scout. - Yeah sure, whatever. Oh, oh, oh, stay. Think it's trying to get away right here. There we go, pal, this is number four on the list. Ah, seriously? - See, take that one. I mean it's just a worm, right, I mean, it's harmless. Watch. Ah, uh-huh, I can chew that. I mean, it's a little slimy, but it's full of protein, man. You can do it, huh? It's there. - Uh-huh, come on, come on, just do it. Just eat it, man, it's a frickin' worm. Yeah, that-a boy, there we go. You're fine, think happy thoughts. - It's disgusting. - Think happy thoughts, come on, think happy thoughts. You're good, you're fine, you're fine. - That sucked. - It's a little gritty, but I mean. - Dude, what? - Everything, it's like nothing rattles you. It's kinda like you're playing Grand Theft Auto and you have all the cheat codes on, it's kind of annoying. - Ah, I just like a challenge I guess, that's all really. - I hate challenges. - What was that all about back there, earlier today? - It's nothin', don't worry about it. - You sure, because I mean, you seemed pretty bent outta shape and I've honestly really never seen you like that before, so. - What was that? - Nothin', it's nothin'. - No, it didn't sound like nothin'. - It's just the guys messin' with us, man. - Why would they do that? - Because they're pricks, that's why. So you were sayin'? - I can't. - What? Can't what? - Okay, seriously. - Hey, would you cut the crap, you guys? - Dude, it's not cool, it's not cool, man. Whoa, where are you going? - Hey listen, just hang tight for a minute, all right. I'm not going far, just, just hold on, all right. - Ethan. Ethan! Hey, sh, quiet! - Ah! Oh, Jesus Christ, what's the matter with you? - Nothing, I was just checkin' things out, what? - That sounded really loud. - Man, it's just the guys trying to freak you out, I told you. Come on, come on. You know, and by the looks of it they're succeeding at it. But what they can successfully do is kiss my ass, is what they can do. Think just 'cause you're cracking some stupid sticks, you're gonna scare me? I ain't scared of you punks, I ain't scared-- Ah! - Son of a, mother. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It was just too perfect, I mean. - Ah, this sucks, why'd I even agree to do this? It's a horrible decision on my part, horrible decision. - Oh, come on, would you stop your complaining? It's not even that bad. - Oh, not that bad. I'm in the middle of the freakin' woods, eating freakin' worms, freezing my freakin' ass off in the freakin' rain. - Look, let me show you something. You see the thing about a fire bundle, right, is to make sure it's tightly packed with the right wood. Look it, you see the different layers I got goin' on here. 'Cause this way when you go to light it, you know it has to-- - Wh-wh-where you goin', man? - Look, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not playin' around. - Goddammit. - Close, stay close. Mind gettin' off of me? - My bad. I just wanna go on record and say this is a dumb idea, dumber than dumb. - Hey listen, all you gotta do it get my back, that's all you gotta do. - You get my back. - Sh-sh. - Who's there? Hello? Don't ever leave me like that! - Sh, shut up. - Did you hear what I just said? - Yeah, I heard you, now shut up. Get down, get down, get down, get down. Get down. What, why would you? What? All right, listen, I need you to stay real close. All right, stay low. You don't have to tell me twice. Follow me. - Sh, sh-sh-sh. - Why you always shushing me? - Just chill it, man. What I just saw, I just saw. - Stay real low, stay quiet all right, come on, come on. We gotta go, make our way to the camp. All right, come on, I got ya. All right, now here we are. I need you to help me find my bag, all right. Yeah, that's gonna be so easy, especially when I can't see anything. Listen, just hurry up. Hurry up, what else would I be doing? Uh, I can't believe this, man. All right, all right, never mind, never mind, I got it, I got it, I got it. All right, all right. Here go, here go, here go. Man I really don't know, I just don't know. Shoot, that was Brandon. Now come on, come on. - Ethan, wait. Let's hurry up, let's hurry up, come on. Just hang on, just hang on, just hang on. - Can you turn on the light, please? - No, not a chance. - Why, I can't freaking see where I'm going. - Just get down, get down, get down, get down. - Then what? - Just wait, wait. - What're we waiting for? - We're staying still. - We need to move and we need to move now. - Look at, don't you move. - Staying here doesn't do us any damn good. - It does if you shut up! - Screw you! - Josh, Josh, no Josh! Wait, Josh! Josh, Josh! - Get off! - Eric, what're you doing, what're doing? - Give me this, give me this. - Forget it, man. - Josh, are you all right, man? What is going on here? - Sh. - Go, go. Sh! Okay. Keep it off, look, let's go. - What was that? - I don't know, it's just frickin' scary. I said, keep it off! - All right, all right. - Guys, what was that? - Hey, where to? - Will somebody tell me what the fuck is going on? - Hey! Keep your damn mouth shut. Hey, what the hell are you doin'? - What does it look like? - Are you serious? - Yeah, I mean, I just ate a worm like 30 minutes ago, so maybe we should wait 30 minutes, or days, before we start swimming. - Hey, what about Brandon and Justin, huh? What're you just gonna leave them behind? Answer me! - What do you want me to say, huh? I'm here, you're here. Them, we don't know about them. - I'm not goin'. - Are you serious? - I'm not leaving until I know for sure, okay. What if it was you, huh? What if it was you in there? - You know what, fine, Josh, let's go. - Hey look, you don't have to stay just because I'm staying. - I know. - What the hell is the matter with you two? God! - You can't swim. - Yeah, so what, so freakin' what? - That's why you were tweakin' on the boat. - That's why you're staying. So you can't swim, or you won't? - Screw you. - Hey, you know what, you're a freakin' pussy, you know that? - Oh, come on, come on, come on, ease up, ease up, will ya. Here, take my knife, take my light, go make some spears, all right. You hear anything, and I mean anything, come right back here, all right? - You guys aren't gonna leave me or anything, right? - No, we'll be right here. Did you see it coming? - No. - Because I mean, if you saw it. - I said no. After I heard Justin scream, I went to go look for him. I told Brandon to run but. What the hell was I suppose to do? Then I went looking for you guys. - Look, first light we gotta find Brandon. - You think he's all right? - We can't leave until we know, right? I'm gonna go check on Josh, all right. Josh, Josh. - Yeah, I'm here. - What the hell are you doin', man? I'm just hanging out. - Listen, turn off the flashlight. - What? - I said turn off the damn flashlight! I cannot believe I'm in here with you right now. - Yeah, tell me about it. - The spears Josh, did you make the spears? - I didn't have a chance to. I've been here trying to, you know. - Oh, we gotta get outta here, let's go. - Wait, wait, wait, do we have to, I mean, it's cozy, I figured we could just spend the night in here. - Josh, what you figured, is wrong. All right, you have no idea what you're doing. You have no idea what we're up against right now, okay. Now we gotta go, all right? - All right, all right, jeez. Sh, sh, sh-sh. - Oh! Fuck. - Josh. Stay back, stay back, stay back. Okay, it's not gonna be able to reach us, so stay back. I think it's gone, we gotta go. No, no, no, no, what're you doing, what're you doing? Just come on, let's go. Look, you cannot just go running off like that, all right, you need to use your damn head. I was, I just figured that it was-- - What you figured was wrong Josh, all right? It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - What is that? - It can't get you in the trees. - Give me my light. - No, I'm capable of holding it, all right. Give me my damn light. - It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - Brandon. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - What're you gonna do? - It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - Hey B, you all right? What're you doin', man? - It can't get you in the trees. - Brandon, tell me what happened, talk to me. - It can't get you in the trees. - Hello. - It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. Josh is here too, Josh, say hey, will you? - It can't get you in the trees. - Hey, B. - It can't get you in the trees. - We need to get you down from there, we need to get you down like now. Get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - Hey, listen, I know what happened, all right. I've seen it. - It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - Did you hear what I said, I've seen it. We've all seen it. You have? - Yes. I gotta tell you, you gettin' way up there though, that's pretty damn impressive. The quicker you get down the better off we all are. So, just hurry up, all right. - Yeah, I'm coming. - Josh, what the hell are you doing? - Checkin' to see if still had some juice. - Shut off the flashlight. Shut off the damn flashlight. Brandon. Brandon, we don't have time to waste, man. You need to come down right now, come on. - Ah! Run Josh, run. Brandon, Brandon, come on man. - It can't get you in the trees. - You gotta come now, come on! - It can't get you in the trees. - Look, let's go, you need to come down right now, Brandon. Come on. - It can't get you in the trees. It can't get you in the trees. - All right, fine, it's fine already. You wanna stay up there, fine. I'll come back for you in the morning, all right. - Ethan! - Josh! Ethan! No! Where do I go? I'm coming, Josh! Josh! - Josh! - Ethan, where are you? Ethan! - I'm coming! Josh, Josh. Hey! - Help me, down! - Help! - Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh shit. Hey Josh, Josh we have to go man. Getting close. Come on, what you waiting for, come and get me. What's wrong you son of a bitch, come on! - Ethan, Ethan. Ethan! - Oh, Eric, Eric, I need you to help me out. - The hell I do. - I'm fine, thanks. - Come on. What were you thinking? I had to do something, didn't I? - Yeah, but let it chase you? Are you freaking nuts? - Look, If you have any better ideas, I'm all ears, all right? What's wrong with your side? - Nothing. - Sorry I gave a shit. - Oh! Hey, how 'bout a little less lip, and a little more trying to help me out, huh? - I can't help you out if you won't tell me what's wrong. - Look, for now, I just need to get up this damn ridge, will you help me? - Come on. Oh Ethan, Jesus Christ, are you okay? - I've been better. Careful, just put me down. - All right, where? Right here's good. - Ah, that's disgusting. - I'm fine, thanks. - You're not fine. - I need a shirt. - What? - A shirt, I need somebody's shirt. - Ah, Jesus, fine already. Here. - That's it, that's all you're gonna do? - You got any better ideas? - Yeah, leave, like now. - We can't. - Still? - We found Brandon. - Brandon, where? - He's up in a tree. - The kid can barely wipe his own ass, and you left him in a tree? - What was I suppose to do, push him down so he'll break his neck. - Come on, guys. - No, but I'd expect you to do more than leave him behind in a goddamn tree! - Leave him behind? Coming from the asshole that wants to leave everybody behind? - Hey, screw you, prick! - Oh hell no! - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. - What was I suppose to do? - Whoa, whoa, he did all he could, all right? - You know what, I don't see you trying to save anybody. - You son of a-- - Whoa, whoa. - Back up! Stop that, separate! Relax! - Where, where you goin'? - Going to cut some damn spears. You don't think I know what you're trying to do, huh? Well what you don't realize is that I'm smarter than you. And I'm more capable than you. And I'm gonna beat you at your own game. Just you watch. Rise and shine, ladies. Oh, the was the worst night's sleep ever. - I'd rather sleep in someone's trunk. - When'd you do all this? - Do I look like I slept? - Yeah well, what you look like is a bag of monkey parts, but hey, who's judging? - What is this all about? - This is called saving our asses, all right? - Good call. - Well hey, what about me? - Well, I made you a special one. - Wow, how sweet. - You're welcome. Here though, keep that running. Let's go. - It got us again. - Okay, you guys stay back, all right. You see anything move, you let me know. Hey, hey, no, no, no, I told you to stay back, didn't I? His face, there's like half of his face left. - Look, when I tell you to do something, you gotta do it, okay. I don't say it because it's fun for me to say. Oh come on, man, the hell's the matter with you? You two need to listen, and listen right now, because it's hearing and it is listening. What I need you to do is listen. We need to go. - Yeah, we know. - No, you don't know. - Look, we're leaving, we just-- - Build a raft, build a bridge, send a carrier pigeon, I don't care. - Everything's okay. - Everything's not okay, we're far from okay. Look, I don't care what we do or how we do it, just do something! - Josh. - What? Don't. What is it? - Did you see what I saw? How could you miss it? All right, look., we gotta go check it out, all right? - What? - We have to. - After you. - All right, come on, stay close, all right. So. - Do you have a death wish? - This isn't funny anymore. - You guys aren't thinking about the big picture here, you know? Whatever is in there, whatever that thing is, it's never been seen before. All right, I mean, what if we're the first ones to find it? To see it, to talk about it. You know, maybe it's some unknown species, the last of its kind. And you guys just wanna walk away from that? Think about the possibilities here. - Have fun guys, good luck. - Are you gonna sack up, or what? Careful, careful, it's a little slippery. Did you bring the flashlight? Of course I brought the flashlight. Careful, careful, it's a little slippery. Please, don't do anything stupid. - Just make sure you keep that spear handy, all right? Okay. I hate the fact that you think this is a good idea. - All you really have to do is follow my lead, that's it. First, sh-sh-sh-- - What? Did you hear that? - These rocks we're stepping all over? - Sh-sh-sh. - Are we good? Are you happy now, are we good, can we go? - Dude, we're getting really, really deep now. Ah, dude! Josh is right, you do have a death wish. We gotta get out of here. - Ethan. Dude, what happened? - Ah, nothin', nothin', we gotta find Brandon. We gotta find Brandon, let's go. Hey, asshole. - Dude, calm down, I'm sure he didn't do anything. What'd you do with the tape? - What're you talking about? - You know exactly what I'm talking about, the tape. The goddamn tape. - Wh-what tape? I don't, I don't even know what you're sayin'. - Don't play me, man. Hey, chillax. - The tape from the video camera, do you know where it is? - Why would I know where it is? - That's it. - Hey, dude stop, come on! - Get off of me, get off of me! - Hey! Hey, hey, I don't think he has it. - Hey, hey, why don't you go work on the raft, huh, hey! - This is some bullshit. - Hey, I'll get him down, we'll figure it out. Why don't you go take a walk or something. - Want some help? Piss off. - What was that all about? - Are you going to come down now? - Yeah, well, I'm just a little high up here. - So, is that a no? - I could use a little help. - Hey. Let me go. - When's the last time you went to the gym? - Last week. Okay, last month, whatever. - Yeah. Whoa! God damn him. - Brandon, get down here. - Man, don't touch it, don't touch it. - All right, all right. All right, what do you want me to do, let me know. Son of a bitch! - Brandon, any day now. All right, I'm trying, I'm coming down right now. All right, Josh, use your head, use your head, Josh. - Look out! Oh Eric, oh man, I'm so sorry. - It's okay, I need, I need a minute. I need a minute. - I gotta look at his leg already. Don't worry about it. - No, dude you can't help him. - Hey man. - Don't touch him. - Hey man, get outta my face. - Don't touch him. - Get outta my face! - Don't touch him. - No, get outta my face. - We can't move him. - Hey. - Hey! Shut up! Josh, help me up. Ah, dude. - Get, get, get up, get up, get up. - Oh, I'm here. Keeps on walking. Watch your leg there. I got you, you okay? Yes, I'm fine. - Watch his leg. - Okay, okay. Don't touch it, don't touch it. Okay, all right, almost there, almost there. - What the hell happened? - He fell from the tree. - That's it, this is all you've got? You call this a raft? - Like all I gotta do is blink and it's done? - At this rate, we're never getting off this island! - Let's see you build a four-person raft. - Will you two just work together so we can get the hell outta here! Fix that. You fix it yourself. - Come on. - Eric, what's next? Stabilize it. - Uh. - Just give it to me. - All right. - Okay. Take my shoe lace. Yeah. - Tie the sticks together. All right, one second. - Don't, don't do it until I say. - Okay. - 'Kay? Okay. - All right. All right. - Go ahead, tie it tight. - You okay? - Count to three. One, two, three. - Come on, man. We got a problem. - What is it now, what's wrong? - I can't get us out of here. - And why the hell not? What about that raft? - Do you see that, that is the sun going down, okay? We got like maybe two to three hours of daylight left. It's not like I can just make a four-person raft in four minutes, all right, it takes time, lots of time. Time we don't have. - So the more time we waste, the less chances we have. - We won't finish it by nightfall. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Look, Eric needs a doctor. Not tonight, not tomorrow, not next week. He needs one right now. - And then what, if we don't finish it by the time it gets dark? Hm? Then, not only are we stuck here another night, but we're stuck here unprepared. Is that what you want? - How long? - Who knows, I mean, it could take up-- - Look, you're not answering my question, I said, how long? - Three hours, at best. - Well that's better than staying here all night. Come on, you all right? - Yeah man, I'm coming. - How you feeling over there? - Great. - I'm doing great too. - Shut up. - Hey uh, I think we need another log. - I think you're right. Come on and give me a hand. - Yeah, let's go. - We'll be right back you guys. - I'm a little cold, can you make me a fire? - Yeah, sure thing. - You've got the flint, right? - Yeah. So how's Eric's ankle doing? - It's broken. - How do you know? - How do I know? I just spent the last hour cleaning it, wrapping it, putting it into a splint. I'm not a doctor, I don't know what I'm doin'? - Yeah, I know. So you're saying he can't walk on it at all? - It snapped in two! - I think the flint's broken. - You can't break a flint, it's a flint. Don't slice your hand open, please. - Look, I'm husky, not incompetent. I don't think you're doing it right. - I think you should shut up. - That thing hunts at night, you know. It's not if it finds us, it's when. And right now, we're unprepared and ill-equipped. So what I need you to do is help me to finish that goddamn raft so we can get the hell out of here, you follow? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I follow, I follow. I'm gonna go take that pile of sticks over there and I'm gonna wrap it all up into a boat. And assuming that it does float, how do you know that thing can't swim? - Land or sea, take your pick. - Almost got it. - That was Eric, come on, here. Come on, that was Eric. Where? - Eric, Eric! Eric, Eric! Brandon, finish that. I'll be back. Get it done! No, no. - I had it, oh-ho-ho. Oh. Josh! I'm coming. Oh, man, Ethan. What're you doing? - I thought you were Josh. I heard him scream. - Did you finish the raft? - It's not gonna float, okay? - But did you try to put it in the water? - It's not gonna float! - Listen, go finish the fucking raft, I'll worry about Josh. - You meet me back there then, okay? Oh, oh. Shit. Ah! Shit, where is it? Oh, come on. Ethan! Josh. Ethan! Josh, I'm coming, Josh, hang on! Ethan! Help! Help, Ethan! Ethan! Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh, I'm coming for ya, hang on! Josh, I'm comin' for ya, hang on, hang on, Josh! Ethan! Hang on, Josh! Josh, I'm coming! Help! - Help me too! Oh, no! - Shit, oh shit. Oh. Oh, oh. Where are you? - Are your friends gonna be game, or what? Where'd you find this guy? - We got a bet, or what? - Yeah, soon as you show them the money. - When you get there, find the dead body. You know I got a couple guys that might be interested. - One is already too many. - Is it all right if I bring my girlfriend along? Make it look like you. All right, come on. - To call aliens. - Yeah, why are we even still here? - I know what you're trying to do. - What'd you do with the tape, the goddamn tape! - And then get the hell out, no evidence. - Hey, turn that thing off. - Don't screw around. - I won't. - Why would you leave both tapes? That doesn't make any sense. The tapes are the key to this whole thing. If we prove that thing exists. - Does it work, or what? - Uh, red light's still on and tape's in it. Yep, it's good, works. - All right, let's get the hell out of here, huh? You had one thing to do, one thing. - And I did it. Everything in the plan I followed through exactly. Josh had- - Sh, sh, sh-sh-sh-sh. - Maybe if you'd planned this out a little bit better, we wouldn't be in this predicament right now. - Shut your goddamn filth hole. Okay? Now get up. Well, go ahead. - Me, why me, you have a gun. - You're the one that forgot the damn tape. - Come here. I can't, it smells too bad, I can't do it. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - Pathetic. - Go on, please. - What're you gonna do with that, huh? - I'm gonna give you two choices. Handcuff yourself to that tree over there, or I'm gonna splatter your fuckin' brains behind that one. - Give me the keys. - Keys, keys, keys. Oh, the tape, that's where it went. I wouldn't be so loud if I were you. Help! Help!
