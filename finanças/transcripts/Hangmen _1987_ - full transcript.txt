(plane engine rumbling) (metal clanging) - You said something, sir? - You're damn right, Andrews. This situation is intolerable to the president. (tense music) - [David] You mean these political assassinations. - [Man] (sighs) We should have listened to you three years ago when Senator Davis was assassinated. - [David] Sir, I thought all along it had to be an inside job. Security was tight. I had my best men on him. (dynamic tense music) (tense music) - We have the senator in sight. - It'll be like shooting fish in a barrel. - We got him. - Don't miss. (guns firing) - Get the senator! Goddamn! I told you to cover the senator! (guns firing) (woman screaming) (men shouting) (gun firing) (somber music) - Jesus Christ, Bone. What've you done? - [Bone] I got him. - Yeah, yeah, I see that. What about these people? - [Bone] I got him! - You're going to be accused. You can't hurt these people. You hear me. You're through Bone, you are through! - [Bone] Get the fuck outta here! Get outta here! - I have reason to believe (tense music) that Section Chief Connolly is responsible. - Connolly may have trained his own secret cadre within the company. What if he makes 'em available to foreign governments? - [Man] We can't have a CIA Section Chief freelancing especially with his dangerous psychological profile. The president is extremely concerned. - Sir, I think I'll have to reactivate Field Agent Greene. - Rob Greene? But wasn't he on the senator's protection detail? - Yes, we had shit can him after that. He's suspected Connolly all these years. On his own he put together a computer file of Connolly's activities. It's the only thing I have to go on. Up until the incident, his record was impeccable. Special Forces Vietnam, highly decorated combat vet. This thing derailed the poor bastard's career. - [Man] (chuckles) You keep Greene under cover tilL after the election. - [David] Connolly will be after him and everybody around him. - If the press gets wind of this, it could sink the president's reelection. Of course, this office will disavow any knowledge. Does Greene have a family? - [David] Yes, sir. - [Man] Oh Christ. 'Cause they'll be in extreme danger. (hand clacking) - Screw head (chuckles). Hi. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I just got things on my mind. - What things? - Things like I have two tests tomorrow that I haven't even bothered to study for and I don't have the time. - Well, you can blow 'em off. - [Lisa] Blow 'em off. My phone is getting cut off tomorrow. What am I gonna pay for it with? - You can use the phone at my place, okay? I think it would be in violator? (Lisa chuckles) (girl grunts) - Is that a yes or a no? (all laughing) (lively music) - [Man] Next class now. - Why don't you come over and see me sometime, big boy? (laughs) - [Danny] Smoking? - Yeah, one of the bad habits I picked up from you. - [Danny] Miss me? - Yeah. - [Danny] Is that a new necklace? (Lisa laughs) - So, what do you wanna do tonight? - I don't know. Wanna go to the union? - No. - Um, wanna go see a film? - No. - Wanna go to the game? - No. - Is, uh, Brian coming home tonight? - No. - Good (chuckles). (plane roaring) (distant lively music) - Caroline? It's Rob. - Hello Rob, Danny's not here. - I don't wanna talk to Danny. I wanna talk to you. - We don't have anything to talk about. - Yes we do, Danny. (tense music) I got some time off. I wanna know if Danny could spend the weekend with me. - No. - [Rob] What do you mean no? I'm his father, damn it. Why do you have to make things so hard? - Rob, where were you when he was growing up? He doesn't even know you. He doesn't even know what you do. - You know the reason for that. He can't know what I do. You may not like it but I am his father. You can't change that. - [Caroline] Danny has a nice life. He's living my lifestyle now. You're never around. You'll just make him unhappy like you did us. - Why can't you let him decide that for himself? I think he's old enough now. - Rob, you're a bad influence. - Bullshit! And you've no right to force your opinion on Danny. - It's too late. - It's never too late. I'm quitting, Caroline, I'm getting out. - (sighs) I heard that before. - Caroline, I'll see him anyway. You know I can. - You stay away from him. - You don't have to make things messy. - He's my son! I have to do what I think is best. (receiver thuds) (tense music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Danny! - Hi, Dad. How'd you find me? - [Rob] It wasn't hard. I got my ways. Come on, let's take a walk. - [Danny] Mom, been giving you a hard time about seeing me again? - [Rob] Danny, you shouldn't be so hard on your mom. She's just doing what she thinks is right for you. - Yeah, well, I think it's time that I should do what I think is right. - Listen, since you don't have any classes for the rest of the day, I thought we could spend the afternoon together. - How'd you know I didn't have any classes? - Hey, a father needs to keep up with what his son's doing. How are your grades? - Oh, you don't know about those, too? - What's the matter, Danny? Aren't you glad to see me? - I don't know, Dad. I mean, just when I get used to you not being around, you show up again and expect us to pick up where we left off. - I wanna make it up to you, son. That's why I'm here now. - [Danny] Don't you think it's a little late to start a father-son relationship, Dad? I mean, I'm gonna be outta college in a couple years. Do you realize that? - [Rob] I don't think it's ever too late, Danny. - [Danny] What's the point? It's gonna be the same old shit over and over again. You're gonna be out of town. - The point is you will be outta school in a couple years, Danny. Then your mother's not gonna have anything to say about how much we're together. Besides that, I'm getting outta business. (Danny scoffs) I've been doing the same thing for 20 years. I'm ready for a change. I'll be able to do anything you want. - (chuckles) I wish I could believe you, Dad, but... - I promise, we'll be together. Look, we can go hunting, fishing. - See that is the point. I don't like hunting. I don't like fishing. You don't know me. You don't know who I am. - I know you like computers. We can go into business together. - Yeah, I like computers. - [Rob] Look, I bought you something. - [Danny] Really? Can I open it? - [Rob] Ah, you better wait till you get that to your room. - [Danny] You gonna tell me what it is? - [Rob] Well, it was mine. Might come in handy some day. (knife clattering) (lively music) - I'm getting ready to kill you with that knife. - Hey, my dad gave me this. - Yeah, why? - He was Special Forces, Vietnam. This is a butterfly knife. - Yeah, how come I never get to see your dad? - He travels a lot. - But what does he do? - He's a businessman. - [Brian] What kinda business is he in anyway? - Look, he's a cool guy, okay? - Yeah, I bet. Cry me a river. (knife clattering) (tense music) (men chattering) (clanging music) - [Man] Mr. Connolly, the disposal unit is reporting on schedule. - Hmm. (radio beeps) - [Man] Yes, sir, target Rob Greene will be terminated... (tense music) (computer beeping) (dramatic ominous music) (tense music) (computer beeping) (dramatic ominous music) (tense music) (dramatic ominous music) (guns firing) (tense music) - Your mother didn't teach you to knock? Go on, try it. (guns firing) (dynamic tense music) (guns firing) (bullets ricocheting) (gun clicks) (guns firing) (tense music) (explosion booming) - [Man On TV] Yes, Captain, I'm here now. Very well, sir. (shouts) (phone ringing) (computer whirring) (dramatic music) - Mr. Connelly, there's a surge on the suspect's phone line. - Voice or data? - Data. - Get Chris Riley. - Yes, sir. (ominous beeping music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Brian] Is Lisa Williams there? - Yeah, yeah, what do you want? - [Brian] It's Brian, Danny's roommate. It's important. - All right, hold on a second. Lisa! - Listen, you bimbo. - [Lisa] What? - [Brian] There's some bone head on the phone for you. - Hello? - [Brian] Lisa. - Hi, Brian, what's happening, dude? - Lisa, just listen to me. I have to get a message to Danny. - What? What do you mean? Wait a minute. What are you talking about? - Now listen to me. You have to tell him a weird message just came over the computer from his dad. - His dad? - [Brian] Danny has to find Dog Thompson. - What do you mean? - Can you get him? - Yeah, I can find him. I think he's over in the gym. - [Brian] Lisa, hurry, his life's in danger. - Yes, I will get him! - This is really weird. (dog barking) - I'm on my way, I will get him, okay? - You gotta find him, okay? - Danny's roommate is such a power tool. But I need to go do this. It sounds like he's in trouble, right? (static crackling) - 321 Mercer Hall. That's a dormitory room. - That's Greene's kid. Contact Mrs. Black. I want this done right. - Yes, sir (laughs evilly). (phone beeping) - Danny Greene, male Caucasian. 18 years old. 321 Mercer Hall at the university. Got it, sir. (tense music) (whistles) Hi. I'm from the escort agency and a bunch of your friends chipped in and we're to go on a date. - Me and you? - Yeah. You think you can handle it, Danny Greene. - I don't have any money. - (chuckles) Believe me. That side of things is all taken care of. - Well, uh, where are we going? - Why don't you leave that up to me, Danny, hmm? - Well, uh, all right, okay. I just have to go to the bathroom and throw water on my face. - Okay. - Okay. (ominous music) (gun clicking) (silenced gun firing) (whistle whistling) (basketball thudding) (boys shouting) - [Danny] Hey, yo! - [Boy] Hey, give it to Danny. (basketball thudding) (boys chattering) - Danny, Danny, listen, listen. Brian got a message on your machine, on the computer thing. Your father. - Okay, just calm-- - Your father is leaving a message. - My father or my step father? - You might be in trouble. There's something going on. I don't know what it is but he left it. You're supposed to get in touch-- - Okay, just relax. (dramatic ominous music) - [Lisa] Somebody he told you to meet him. (clanking rhythmic music) (tense music) (ominous music) (tense chase music) (tense music) - [Kim] Rob, what happened? - Close the door. I had an accident. I don't think it's bad but it sure hurts like hell. (tense chase music) (tense music) Kim, I need to stay here a couple of days. - [Kim] Well, of course, Rob. Are you in trouble? - Yeah, I got a problem (winces). - [Kim] Are you gonna tell me about it? - I think it's better if you don't know. - [Kim] Why shouldn't I know? Rob, you know I'll help you. - [Man On TV] Yeah, but does she know that? (Rob sighs) - [Man On TV] No. - All right. I work for the government. I got some information that some people need badly. Be watching my place. I can't go back there. Okay? (tense chase music) (train rumbling) Damn it, Andrews, that was close. They were right on me. (tense music) - Connelly acts fast. You should know that. He knows you're onto him. That will make him even more dangerous. - Look, I'm worried about my boy. I want somebody to check on him. - We'll do it. Right now I need you to be out of sight. - Okay, but I'm not much good at sitting tight. I wanna do something, Andrews. (tense chase music) (dog barking) (Danny panting) - Danny, what are you doing home from college? - Mom, something really weird is going on. - Look, just calm down. - Listen, my roommate Brian left me this really freaked out message from Dad. He's in trouble and I'm not supposed to trust anybody until he talks to me. - You know this isn't funny. If your father-- - I know. And not only that, I'm supposed to find this guy Dog Thompson. - Dog Thompson? (sighs) That's a name I haven't heard in 10 years. You know, he was your father's best friend during the war. I think he runs a junkyard now in Jersey City. All of your father's army buddies are like that. I think your roommate is playing a big joke on you. - I don't think so. He's disappeared, nobody can find him. That's why I came home. (door bell ringing) (lively music) (Phillipe sighs) There's the door. - [Danny] Mom, don't answer it. - Danny, I'm gonna answer the door! - Mom, please. (Danny panting) (dynamic music) - Who is it? - Fire department inspection today. - [Phillipe] Inspection? I wasn't notified about any inspection today. - Just cooperate. - [Phillipe] No, no, you gotta leave. Wait, don't push me around. This is my-- - [Caroline] Honey, what's going on? - [Phillipe] Don't push me around. This is my house. Don't do that to me. - Are you Mrs. Greene? - I was Mrs. Greene? (ominous music) What are you, what are you doing? (dramatic music) No, no (screaming)! You're hurting, help! - Shh. - [Caroline] No! No, no. Don't do it. What are you doing? (screaming) Oh, don't hurt me, help! - I'll get help. (gun firing) - Your ex-husband has been making things very difficult. - [Caroline] Oh, don't hurt me, help! (dramatic music) (tense music) (dynamic tense music) (tense music) - Excuse me, is Mr. Dog Thompson here? - [Dog] Who the fuck's asking? - Um, well, I was told he works here. - [Dog] Beat it, cheese dick. - Look, I gotta talk to him. He was my dad's best friend and... Could you just tell him that Rob Greene's son Danny is here? - [Dog] Bullshit. I haven't seen Rob Greene for 10 years. - You're Dog Thompson? Listen, you gotta help me. (tense chase music) - [Dog] Hey, who are those guys? - Listen, I wasn't kidding. You got a gun? - [Dog] Yes. - [Danny] Hurry up. (dramatic rhythmic music) (guns firing) (gun firing) (guns firing) (tractor rumbling) (compactor whirring) (metal crumbling) (tense chase music) - What in the hell did you do to piss those people off, boy? - Nothing, I didn't do anything, okay? - [Dog] Oh bullshit, bullshit. People don't go around killing other people for no reason. - Look, I didn't, I didn't have anything to do with it. It was because of my dad, okay? I don't even know what happened. - Shut up, shut up, shut up, okay? I haven't seen your dad in years. Do you know where he is? - No, I have no idea. - Great. - I mean, he travels a lot. He's out of the country. - You don't know where he is now? - No, I have no idea where he is. Did you used to sell insurance with my dad? - (laughs) Do I look like I sell insurance? Do I look like I've ever sold insurance? Do I even look like I have insurance? You don't know where he is now, huh? - [Danny] No, I just told you, I don't... - Damn it! (fist thuds) I'm getting too old to be doing this bullshit, kid. Do you have any money? - Yeah, I got like five bucks. - Good I need it. Give it to me. - Why? Look, look, you could get a credit card advance or a cash machine card. - No. Just gimme the money. - [Danny] Well, what do we need it for anyway? We got a full tank of gas. - I need a drink. - Listen, I'm sorry, but I don't wanna ride in the car with you if you're gonna drink and drive. - Ah, come on. Gimme the money, please. Pretty please, we'll be a guy, be a team. Danny and Dog fighting the bad guys out there, evil, communism everywhere, me and you, okay? (laughs) Gimme the five bucks. (tense music) - You missed the fat bastard? Kid is obviously gathering Greene's old Special Forces team. Over-the-hill commandos. Get me their files. - Yes, sir. (clanking music) - [Sado] Lieutenant Ken Edwards. Extremely loyal to Greene. The kid may go there. - Terminate. (tense music) (dramatic ominous music) (woman screaming) (guns firing) - [Sado] Sergeant Michael Ryan. Served with Greene for two tours. - Terminate! (tense music) - Yo, yo, back it up. We're closed, man. Get the hell outta here. (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Bone Conn. (tense music) Former Special Forces. Also Greene's right hand man in the Secret Service. - Yes, I know Mr. Conn all too well. Very volatile character. Doubtful whether he'd lift a finger to help Rob Greene. But kill him anyway. - [Danny] Where are we gonna go now, huh? - We're going to find out just how many friends your dad does have left. - What do you mean how many friends my dad has left? - Well, all the ones I know are dead. - What are we gonna do now, huh? What the fuck are we gonna do now? You just killed a bunch of those guys. - Hey, you're with Dog Thompson, goddamn it. Don't you worry about a thing, son. (gun firing) (Dog laughs) - [Bone] Sawyer! - [Dog] Bone! (men grunting) (Dog laughing) - Looking good, keeping fit. That's important. Your breath could knock a buzzard off a shit wagon at 10 klicks. (Dog laughing) What are you doing here? - Listen, I need your help. This is Rob Greene's kid. - How do you do? - Rob's in a lot of shit and he's drug his kid into it. - Are you kidding me? You hear what happened? - No, I've been out of touch. - Well, after the war, Rob Greene got me a job in the Secret Service. It was a good job. Had a lot of fun with it. Anyway, make a long story short, we were doing protection detail together. An assassination attempt, real fucking bloodbath. Civilian casualties, the whole nine yards. Press had a field day with it. - What kinda hit was it? - Real pro, gangland style. Ran a make on 'em, never got a connection though. Rob Greene made sure to get me shit canned though for that. - Well, they're after his kid. - Yeah, no, I won't do shit to help Rob Greene. (gun firing) - Would you do it for me? I need ya. (dramatic music) (tense music) - Yo, Bone, one of these guys wanna stick to on a pail. There's a couple guys up there want-- (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Go, go, go, down there, down there. (tense chase music) (guns firing) (tense music) (punches thudding) (men grunting) - There have been several disposal units activated, Rob. I thought you should know. One was your ex-wife. - Oh shit! Danny, what about Danny? - No, no, he seems to be one step ahead of them. Kid's pretty resourceful. - [Rob] Pretty sharp, huh? - He's managed to link up with Dog Thompson and Bone Conn. He's safe for now. Connelly got to Ryan and Edward. - Oh shit! - The only guy left from your unit is Reynolds. - Well, that tells me where Dog and Bone will going next. - Greene, I can't afford to have you at risk. If you surface now and Connelly gets to you, it could endanger the entire department. (car rumbling) - Let me get this straight. Firemen broke into your house and killed your parents. - Yeah. - They showed up at your college and tried to arrest you. - Yeah. - Showed up at your junkyard and you wasted five of 'em. - Yep, and they interrupted my goddamn lunch. Nearly got away. - Who do you think they are? - Well, I don't know but they're the original article that's for damn sure. - You don't think they're Company? - Well hell, I don't know. You worked for the guys, not me. - I don't think they are. I think they're freelancers. What do we do? - Well, you could just do what you usually do just go ahead and slaughter everybody that gets in your way. (laughs) - Yeah, funny. What do we do? - Why don't we just turn ourselves into the cops? (doors creaking) (hood clattering) Have you killed many people? - Yeah, I've done lots of people, kid. Some very interesting ways. Remind me to tell you about it. - Did my dad ever kill anyone? - Your dad was very good at what he did. - What was that, what he did? - Running long range recon patrols, ambushes, search and destroy missions, offing the enemy. He was the bravest officer I ever met. - [Danny] So you guys were kinda like best friends? - Not exactly. (sighs) When I got in, I was a dumb hothead looking to get my ass shot off. He taught me how to stay alive. - Is that why you're helping me? - Not really. (somber music) - [Girl] Have you heard from him yet? - No. - [Girl] What about his roommate? - No, I haven't heard from him in about two days. - Have you tried his parents? - I tried calling his mom. But um, there's no answer there. And his dad is, his dad's like away on business all the time. That's how this whole thing started was like with his dad and everything and I'm... (cries) I'm so scared. (cries) Now the two of them. And I don't know what to do. It's like I can't do anything, you know. (cries) (tense music) - The boy's on the road. It's only a matter of time before we find him. - Perhaps we're taking the wrong approach with young Master Greene. Bring me his girlfriend. Obviously he needs a more personal invitation. - You got it, boss. (gentle music) (moving to tense music) (eerie music) (siren blaring) - [Man] Okay, come on here. Okay, come on here. - [Dog] You should know, you used to work with those guys. They're your friends, your buddies. - What we got in here? - Well, we have, here you take this. - [Waiter] A machine gun! Yow! - Yeah (laughs). - Is it a real one? - (laughs) Yes. - Where'd you get it? - Uh, a Vietcong gave it to me. - Gave it to you? What'd you do, kill him? - (laughs) Yeah. - Fucking great. When was that? - Uh, 1971, it's likely. - '71, yeah, '71 yeah. - How many-- - Excuse me, sir. Could I have another Coke? - Fuck off! (men laughing) I'd like to get myself one of these. - You would? - Got a spare one? - No, nothing. - Hello, Charlie. - My usual. - Sure. - Yeah, you like that, huh? - Where'd the bullets go? - Phone call for you. - [Danny] What? - Put it right there. - Come on. - [Bone] But we're not gonna do it. - [Dog] Ah, what are you waiting for? - [Bone] No. - Show nothing but power. - [Dog] No, no, no, no, no. - [Waiter] Wouldn't have to work in a dump like this if I had one of these, huh, I'll cover ya. - No-- (imitates machine gun firing) - Hey far enough. - This is your home. - Hello? (tense music) - [Connelly] Mr. Danny Greene? - Who is this? - Danny, I would like very much to meet with you. - Listen, I don't know anything. - Danny, I have a friend of yours here. Little Lisa. Pretty little Lisa. She wants to talk to you, Dan. - Danny! - Lisa! (Lisa screams) Lisa! - Danny, now-- - Look, leave her alone. She has nothing to do with this. - Danny, let's set this up. Now, there's a sedan outside. Get in it or I will personally kill her. - All right, all right, I'll do it. Listen, just don't hurt her. (men chattering) (tense music) - Where'd you get those tattoos? - Mad Jack Johnson, New York City. - Hey, where's the kid? Where's the fucking kid? - I don't know. - Come on, come on! - Thank you. - Come on! - I'm going! - Hey, where's the fucking money? - [Bone] Fuck you! (tense music) - [Dog] What the hell are we gonna do now? Captain Greene's gonna kill us, I just know he is. - [Bone] Shut the fuck up and let me think. - [Dog] What do you mean shut the fuck up? I can hear it now. Dog, what'd you do? You really fucked up didn't ya? - [Bone] We gotta get Reynolds. We gotta put the team back together. - [Dog] God, I hope he's still not wearing that stupid hat. (tense music) (gloves thudding) - Well, look what the fucking cat dragged in. What the fuck do you guys want? - He ain't changed a bit. He's a big, black (drowned out by footsteps thudding). - Come on, man! Teach these white boys some respect! - Hey, these are brothers. Besides, they ain't white. They just got light skin. - Yeah, Brillo head. Just do what your master told you. (rhythmic music) (man grunts) (men grunting) - Goddamn it, that's enough! (gun clicking) (tense music) - 10 years and you ladies can still fuck up a wet dream. - Captain, I-- - Yeah, I know. You let 'em take my boy. Well, you don't have to worry, because I'm gonna give you a chance to help me get him back. (gate clattering) - [Lisa] Danny! Oh, Danny, are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. - [Lisa] What's going on? - I don't know. - Shut up, bitch! - Leave her alone. (tense music) - Danny! - Beat her up! - Danny, leave him alone! - [Man] Shut up! - [Lisa] Please don't hurt him. Are you all right? - [Danny] Yes. - [Man] Did you hear what I said? Shut up! - [David] Rob. - Andrews, this is not some Company operation. We're talking about my son! I think you guys are losing control. No, you listen to me! If you can't handle this, I will myself. - All right, find Delaney. He'll know where Connolly's holding Danny. - Delaney, yeah, I know where to find him. (tense rhythmic music) (tires screeching) Hey, Delaney! How you been? (tires screeching) (gun firing) Have I got your attention now? - [Delaney] What the fuck do want? - [Rob] I wanna take a meeting. - Get the fuck away from me. - Okay, put that away. Just wanna talk to ya. - [Delaney] What do you wanna talk about? - Do you know where my boy is? - [Delaney] How the fuck should I know where your boy is? - Spy on you. You're gonna tell me where he is. Tell me where he is! - He's at Connolly's headquarters! - The power plant? What part? - [Delaney] Section B. - You better not be lying to me, Delaney. - Look, why don't you just give him the goddamn files? - (chuckles) Yeah sure. That's the only thing that's keeping me alive right now. Good talking to you, Delaney. Just remember one thing. I know where you live. (Connolly sniffs) - [Delaney] Going? - I hear you been in touch with Greene. - Uh, no, no. - You didn't contact Greene? - Uh, no, I didn't con, no. - You talked with him? - Uh, he contacted me but we really didn't-- - Did he ask you where the kid was? - No, no, we didn't even talk the kid or-- - You didn't tell him. - No, I no, I don't-- - All right, carry on. - Um... - Get back to your duties. (tense music) - Okay. (guns firing) - Rob? - Andrews. Yeah, I found Delaney. (chuckles) Yeah. Well, I know where Danny is. They got him at the power plant. Listen, I need a favor. I need a plan of some kind. - Go to the courthouse in the hall of records. Get the original architect's blueprints. They haven't modified the floor plans any. (dramatic tense music) (tense music) - Section B. It's Plan B7, section B. You found it yet? (radio chattering) What's the matter? - Look, you want me to stay and watch and you look for the fucking things? - Yeah, yeah, that'd be real good, right? First guy that walks through you blow him away like last time? - Shit. That was an accident. I'm not with the Company anymore, okay? - You can say that again. You're still blaming me for that, aren't you? I wasn't the one that blew all those people away. That was you! - Calm down! - I am calm, goddamn it! (Bone pants) - Look, I'm supposed to be the hothead here. What's going on with you, man? - I don't know. - It's too personal, Rob. This has gotten too personal for you. Let's go back to our old way of doing things, by the book. We'll get through this, okay? (tense music) We okay? - Yeah. - Let's get outta here. - Andrews, it's Greene. Listen, I've rounded up what's left of my unit. I need equipment. Can you help me? - Go to the usual source. See Moe Boone. He'll set you up. - Yeah, Moe Boone. Okay, I got it, Andrews. Thank you. (tense music) (gate rattling) - Rob Greene. Long time no see. So how come you walk in here with a gun? - Tools of the trade, Moe. (somber music) - I always liked you. Ernie, what did I say the other day about him? - Uh, yeah, boss. - See. Take his gun. I don't like people carrying guns in my place. - (chuckles) Yeah, I can see that, Moe. - Nothing personal, just business. What can I do for you? - Same as always. I need some equipment. - [Moe] You guys always paid cash. - I got cash. - I like people who pay cash. - But I need a lot of fire power in a small package for say six men. - How about a launch rocket? The fucking thing will knock out a tank. - Whoa, whoa! I don't need to take out a fucking tank. We don't wanna attract any more attention than we have to. Might be doing some night work. You got any Starlight goggles? - Oh, that's a special item. That's really gonna cost you. - Yeah, Moe, these'll work. (gun clicking) Nice, Moe, but I got one. (guns clicking) Okay, I need two of these MAC-10s. (gun clicking) I'll take the SPAS. - Ernie, be sure and write this down. - SIG. I don't need the Uzis, don't need the M-16s. I need another shotgun. Case of number four buck, 3000 rounds of nine millimeter ball, and tear gas grenades. So how much for the whole package? - 25 grand. - Aw, come on, Moe. For 15 grand I can get this stuff on the street. - On the street? You're a dead man. Where else you gonna go? Because I like ya, 20 grand. Take it or leave it. - [Rob] You gonna kiss me when you're done fucking me, Moe? Wrap 'em up. (tense music) - Danny, please tell me what is going on. - I, I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I don't know. It has something to do with my dad. - What do you mean your dad? - I don't know. He fucked up or something. - Why am I here? - I'm sorry, Lisa. I just, I don't know. - How are we gonna get out of here? - We're gonna get out of here. - How are we gonna get out of here? - I promise you, I promise you, we're gonna get outta here. Some army buddies of my dad. I was just with them. - What do you mean army buddies? - They're really good at this stuff. - Who are they? - They're friends of my dad. They're professionals. They know what they're doing. (guns clicking) (tense music) - [Rob] Gentlemen, let me tell you what we're up against. These guys are professionals. Your ops orders are real simple. We got some friendlies in there, my son. So fire discipline and target acquisition are critical. Be selective. We do it by the numbers, just like old times. Sorry to call in my markers, but I got no choice. - [Bone] We're even after this, Captain. - [Rob] I did what I had to do. - Yeah, we all did. - I need your expertise, Bone, but I need you cool. I don't need a hot dogger that's gonna get our asses in a sling. Now we're a team again. You got it? - (sighs) Got it, Captain. - It's been a long time, Rob. - You know I wouldn't drag you into this if I had a choice. They got Danny. He's all I got left. (gun clicking) - It's cool, Rob. Let me take the brothers. - I don't know. - No, they're good. - I hope so, I certainly hope so, Reynolds. (somber music) You look like hell, Dog. - Sorry about the kid. I mean-- - See you still got that AK you picked up. - Yes, sir. - I remember the day you got that. Think you can still run that fast? - (chuckles) No, sir. We'll get your boy back, though. - All right, ladies, listen up. I've been inside the headquarters. It's a power plant. It's got catwalks, generators, machinery, a thousand places to hide. But that works in our favor as well as it does theirs. Here's what we're gonna do. (gun clicking) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (man gasps and gags) Move it, Dog, move it, come on. Dig him out, fellas, dig him out. (explosion booming) (alarms blaring) - We have a security breach, sector three. - People, this is not a drill. Standard defensive procedures. By the book. Man your stations. (tense rhythmic music) (guns clicking) (dynamic music) (tense music) (dynamic music) (tense music) (smoke hissing) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (men coughing) (guns firing) (electricity crackling) (dynamic music) (gun firing) (tense music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - [Draff] Man, I'm glad you didn't miss. - [Bone] What the fuck you talking about? I was aiming for you (laughs). (hard rock music) (guns firing) - Whoa! You know, I know this really sounds like a line, but I like aggressive women. Uh, do you like fat guys? - Yeah, I like 'em dead. - Well, gotta go. (guns firing) (Mrs. Black screaming) - Hey, you, come here! Come here! Yeah, you come here! (gate rattling) (dynamic music) (Lisa screams) (Danny shouts) (Lisa screaming) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (Rob panting) (tense music) (hard rock music) (man shouting) (guns firing) (tense music) (hard rock music) (guns firing) (somber music) - Oh shit. Reynolds, I'm sorry. (tense music) (door knob rattling) - [Danny] Get outta here! - Greene, I got the kid! Greene, do you hear me? (guns firing) I'll blow him away. Dad, Dad! Come and get him. (guns firing) Brave ow! Come on the fuck out! Greene, hurry. I'm gonna blow him away now! (tense music) - [Rob] Let the boy go. - [Connolly] Drop the gun. - [Rob] Stay by the place. Let the boy go! - [Connolly] I'll blow him away, you know I will! - No you won't. I still got the tapes, Connolly. - [Connolly] Wanna negotiate, drop the gun. (tense music) - All right. - Drop it! - All right. Now the kid. You can bet-- (gun firing) (Rob shouts) - Drop the gun goddamn it! Goddamn it, drop the gun! Kick it. Right. You want your boy? Beg for him. - Kiss my ass. - Get down and beg! - You'll let him go? - On your knees. - [Rob] Promise me you'll let him go. (tense music) (Connolly groans) (dynamic music) (gun firing) (somber music) - [Dog] Jesus. Sit down, come on, sit down, sit down, come on. Take this. - [Bone] The man's crazy. Didn't blow your nose in that, did you, Dog? - No way! Well, not today anyway. (Bone panting) Come on, Bone, we gotta get outta here. Come. Well, I think we ran out of people to kill. (gentle music) (Lisa panting) (Lisa screams) - Take it easy, all right? I'm one of the good guys. I'm gonna get you outta here. Now just follow me. (emotional music) (sirens blaring) (people chattering) - Drop your weapons. (tense music) Drop your weapons! - Bullshit! I wanna see somebody I know. - We're police officers, drop your weapons! - How do I know that? Gimme somebody I know. - Drop those weapons right now! (tense music) - Let the boy and girl walk. They didn't have anything to do with this. - Nobody walks away. Drop the weapons! - All right, Danny, start walking to your right, real slow. Get moving and run if you have to. (ominous music) - [Officer] Ready? Ready? - Wait! You're making a mistake! (siren blaring) You're gonna have a bloodbath here. - Hold it! Hold your fire! - Who are you? - CIA, Langley. This is federal. Listen, I know the man. Just gimme one chance. Rob! - [Officer] Weapons up. Weapons up. Weapons up! - It's me, it's Andrews. - Well then call 'em off! - They're called off! Rob, put the gun down. Go ahead, Rob, put it down. Put the gun down. Now call them off. - Put it down, Bone, Dog. Put it down, Bone. Danny! - I'm here, Dad.
