(NO AUDIO) Okay...(SIGHS) The first time I ever sang The National Anthem was before a homecoming basketball game at my high school on Long Island. I was 16 years old. All I remember is being so nervous, that I had this death grip on the microphone cord, and after I finished singing, I walked over to where my mother was standing and I said, "Mom, I can't open my hand!"

My name is Janine Stange and I'm The National Anthem Girl (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (MAJESTIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) JANINE: I grew up on Long Island, New York, in a very normal, very Italian, very patriotic family. My great grandparents came here from Italy at the turn of the century. (CAMERA CLICK SOUNDS) (CAMERA CLICK SOUNDS) JANINE: Every day after school and every weekend, I worked in my parents' bagel shop. We had the best bagels, but I really think that people came in just to see my mother. Everyone loved her, and there were lots of regulars, but there was one group that she had a major soft spot for... and that was our men and women in uniform. She always went above and beyond to make sure they felt like a million bucks when they came in. That really made an impression on me. JANINE: I was always singing The National Anthem... at high school functions, later on in college, community events... just anywhere and everywhere I could. I loved singing The National Anthem. In 2007, I moved to I.A. with the intention of recording a CD. (ROCK MUSIC) (ROCK MUSIC) JANINE: I had a producer... had lots of connections... and I wound up spending all my savings on this album. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be something I was uber proud of, and not the album where I would finally make it. It wasn't a good thing. JANINE: My family thought I was staying in I.A. because I was having such a great time, but the truth was I didn't even have enough money to move back to New York, and I didn't want to tell them this. So here I was, at this point in my life, tired from all the rejections of trying to self-start a music career. But most of all, I was concerned about my lack of direction and the time I spent floundering because of my 'when-then'. A 'when-then' is a statement that Goes something like this... "When I win the lottery, then I'll buy my parents a new house." "When I feel motivated, then I'll go to the gym." My personal 'when-then' statement always went something like this... "When I get that record deal and have a hit song, then I'm going to give back." JANINE: And I had no idea what that meant: I didn't know what I was going to do. I just knew, "when I'm this famous philanthropic artist, then I'm going to give back and make a big difference!" JANINE: But my 'when-then' wasn't happening, because my music career wasn't taking off, and most of all, because of the 'when-then', I was feeling disgruntled. JANINE: I'm not sure what specifically happened to cause it... maybe I was just fed up... but something changed inside of me one day... and I stopped the insanity of the 'when-then delusion' and decided, "I'm going to do what I can with what I have from where I am." I'd like to say I came up with that, but it's a modified Theodore Roosevelt quote. So I asked myself, "What do I have?" Well, I could sing, and the one song that I loved to sing was The National Anthem. It was a song that I believed in, and I'd been singing practically all my life. JANINE: What if I could use that song to promote a dialogue about patriotism and pride? And when I did that, when I attached myself to something that was bigger than me, instead of feeling sorry for myself, that's when my mind and my heart began to get on a roll. JANINE: And shortly after that, it occurred to me, " You know, nobody's ever sung The National Anthem in all 50 states. That would be perfect!" JANINE: Some people run marathons for a cause. This will be my marathon. I'll promote patriotism by being the first person to sing The Star Spangled Banner in all 50 states! Now, how do I do that? Okay, Here's the deal: I had no corporate sponsorships... no over-the-top connections... no booking agent support team... and very little money in my bank account. How in the world was I going to fly all over the country, including Alaska and Hawaii, and sing The National Anthem in every state? Then a light bulb sort of went off in my head as I realized something: JANINE: Since I was 16, and over the years, I'd already sung at events in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Texas, Arkansas, Maryland, Georgia, Massachusetts, and California. So I started off the mission with 9 states already under my belt. Just 41 states to go. So I was all set. With the money I had in my savings, I was just going to pay as I went along and hope for the best. One foot in front of the other. And one other thing: In every place I was going, every state, every event, the focus was going to be on the melody as it was written. No vocal acrobatics, no poetic license. ♪ And the home, of the ♪ ♪ Braaa-aaaave. ♪ JANINE: This song was not going to be my my American Idol audition. This was not my song. It was our song. So that was settled. All I had left to figure out was how to sing The National Anthem in 41 states to make all 50. JANINE: Okay, so my new-found mission officially kicked off in Florida on July 3rd, 2012. I sang The National Anthem for the Single-A Tampa Yankees at George Steinbrenner Park. Okay, so we are here in the main lobby of the Tampa Yankees... so, I thought that we would video some things so that you all could see different memorabilia from the Yankees that's here. We have a picture of George & Joan Steinbrenner. Some trophies. I don't think this is the real one because I think it would be in glass and somebody would be yelling at me right now because I'm touching it. This is my favorite piece of the whole place. So there you have it. So, we're going to go upstairs in a little while. This right here is a, um, a artifact as well. It's my hairclip because it's really humid outside, and uh, I'm trying to keep it back so I don't look like a crazy person when I go out there and sing. ♪ And the home of the ♪ ♪ Brave ( APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) JANINE: Florida was State #10, and I was off to the races. Next, I sang in Williamsport, PA, before the Williamsport Crosscutters minor league baseball game... then it was on to Newport, Rhode Island, where I sang in the company of Pete Sampras at the Tennis Hall of Fame Championship Weekend. After that, I sang for The Denver Outlaws at Mile High Stadium, then it was on to Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati, Ohio... for the Reds versus the Mets game: My first performance at a major league baseball stadium. State #15 was a pro Bullrider's event in Greensboro, NC, and the spectacle of an Italian girl from Long Island surrounded by a sea of cowboy hats. JANINE: I finished out 2012 at another pro Bullriders event, this one in Las Vegas, NV, broadcast on CBS Sports. So 2012 was over. 16 states under my belt. I felt like I was making, you know, some progress. But with 34 states still left to go, I was starting to the enormity of what I had committed to taking on. I started off 2013 in The Windy City for another pro Bullriders event. State #18, I sang The Anthem for The High School Dream Bowl in Salem. VA. I also got a lesson how brutally cold and windy the Southeast can be at the end of January. In July 2013, I sang The National Anthem before a lacrosse event sponsored by Nike in Beaverton, OR. Bringing my total states up to 19. This event was also where I received a pair of fluorescent yellow Nikes that would become my permanent travel companions throughout every airport on my journey. So for the entire year of 2013, I only added 4 states to my total. "Not bad," I said, "19 states down, 31 more to go." I wish could have added more, but I had limited resources. And hey, who cared how long it took me to sing The Anthem in all 50 states. I mean, it's not like there was a time limit, right? Wrong! It was January, 2014, and I was in Baltimore, Maryland. As I was shutting the trunk of my boyfriend's car, I noticed something on the license plate. It said, 'Star Spangled 200 dot com'. I grabbed my phone, went to the website... The Star Spangled Banner was turning 200 years old that year, 2014, on September 14th. Oh my gosh. What are the odds? I said, "That's it! That has to be the completion date... the goal that brings this whole thing home! What better way to raise awareness for the song, and all the brave men and women it represents? The 200th anniversary of The National Anthem!" I had never been so excited and so panicked at the same time. It also meant that I had exactly nine months to sing The National Anthem in 31 states. Cue the hyperventilating. Okay, so that wouldn't be so bad. I mean, that only meant, what, like, 3 or 4 states a month? I could do that, right? I had to find events and convince people to book me to sing at them in 31 states: And of course, figure out to pay for all of it while not getting kicked out of my apartment. JANINE: My bank account would probably get me through about 5 or 6 states. I remember, I converted my bedroom to, what I called, 'The Situation Room'. I called every major college, minor league, major league, teams, charity events, anything I could find. I would explain to them what I was doing, and, hopefully, if they didn't hang up on me, I would get booked. RADIO HOST: Janine stange, aka national anthem Girl, welcome to the show. JANINE: Thank you. It's great to be on. HOST: Well, you know, singing in all 50 states, that is an ambitious goal. JANINE: I just, I felt for the need. You know, The National Anthem is turning 200 on September 14th, and even prior to realizing that, I always said I'd link to sing The anthem in all 50 states. HOST: I can tell in your voice, that's truly a passion Of yours. JANINE: It's really to promote awareness for the fact that The National Anthem is not just, like I said, a formality. And there was also one other thing. (JET SOUNDS) (EPIC MUSIC) I decided I wanted to give back even more. JANINE: The sole purpose of the journey was to honor our brave and raise awareness that the song our armed forces give meaning to was about to turn 200. So I got in touch with a woman named Carolyn Blashek. She's the founder of Operation Gratitude, which is an organization that sends out thousands of care packages every year to military personnel who are deployed. And in those care packages, there's always a handwritten note to people in uniform. So I said to Carolyn, "I'm going to all these venues across the U.S... what if every place I go, I set something up so private citizens, everyday people, from all over the country, write thank you notes to go into these packages that you're sending out?" And Carolyn said, "Go for it." So with that, the bar on my journey was raised again: I was actually going to be able to attach this act of gratitude to those who serve while I was promoting The National Anthem's 200th. (LIVELY PIANO MUSIC) (LIVELY PIANO MUSIC) (LIVELY PIANO MUSIC) TV HOST: One thing we all do, no matter how big or small the game, is stand, remove our hats, as we listen to the nation's song. One woman is trying to remind everyone just how important that its. Meet Janine Stange, better known as, The National Anthem Girl. Stange is performing The Star Spangled Banner in all 50 states this year. Alabama is number 20 under her belt as she spreads patriotism throughout the country. Along with singing our country's song, The National Anthem Girl is collecting handwritten thank you cards that will go into care packages for deployed military and veterans. JANINE: Alabama marked the first venue where I implemented the thank you cards for the troops... and people loved it... which was very exciting for me, to see college students, older veterans, young kids, all come together at a table, even kneeling on pavement, expressing their gratitude, in their own words, to those who protect our freedom. The mission was coming to life. So with this new sense of urgency, I started to get a little wiser with how I did my bookings to sing The Anthem: Meaning, trying to choose states that were next to each other, which helped alleviate the expensive flights, due to the dart board planning approach that I'd used early on. So, on this particular trip down south, I sang The Anthem at The University of Mobile baseball game in Alabama. The next day, it was another baseball game for Southern Miss University in Hattiesburg, MS... and the next day a baseball game for The Tulane Green Wave in New Orleans, LA. ♪ ...And the home of the brave ♪ (CROWD CHEERS) JANINE: Three days. Three states. Now I was getting into a rhythm. On April 1st, I had the honor of singing The Anthem at the Orpheum Theater in Phoenix for Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell's Patriot Tour Event. (EMCEE SPEAKING) (EMCEE SPEAKING) (EMCEE SPEAKING) (EMCEE SPEAKING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) ♪ Oh, say, can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early ♪ ♪ Light... o'er the land ♪ ♪ Of the free, ♪ ♪ And the home of ♪ ♪ The brave (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) JANINE: The line at my thank you card table was so long. Priceless. JANINE: The next day, I flew to Utah, State #24, for the Utah Grizzlies minor league hockey team. Now, this was an interesting one. In the past, when I've sung on ice. They give you a rug to stand on. JANINE: But not here. They swore it was safer, but I was there with these high heeled boots on with hockey players whizzing past me during the intros. Thank God I did not fall flat on my face. The Utah trip was also when I realized that it seemed a few people were beginning to hear about what I was doing. This nice couple who had been following me on Twitter came to the game with their kids, took me to dinner, and dropped me off back at the airport. This journey was starting to make me feel like we are really all one big family. It was nice. JANINE: My next state was Delaware: My halfway point. State #25 out of 50. I was scheduled to sing The National Anthem for The University of Delaware Women's Lacrosse team, The Blue Hens. Delaware was not only my midpoint state, it was also my planes, trains, and automobiles state. To get to Wilmington, I had flow from Utah to New York, took a taxi to my brother's house, then too a subway to the Amtrack station, and rode the train down to Delaware, where I took the scenic route to the stadium on foot. But I did get good photos. After I sang The Anthem, I rode back to the train station on a bus. The only thing I was missing was a boat. My next state that marked the beginning of the second half of my journey was West Virginia: State #26. JANINE: West Virginia... let me tell you about West Virginia. I was scheduled to sing The Anthem for The Musselman High School Applemen baseball game in Inwood, WV. The day of the event, the game got rained out. So, since I was already there, and needed a venue so I could add West Virginia to my list of states, the nice people at Musselman High offered me an alternative sporting event. Donkey basketball. Up until this point, I'd sung on diamonds, gridirons, ice, tennis courts, in boxing rings... never before had I sung in the presence of donkeys. If you told me when I started out that I'd be promoting patriotism around a bunch of high schoolers in helmets, indoors, shooting baskets while sitting on the back of donkeys... it was actually pretty fun. Smelly, obviously, but fun. PRINCIPAL'S VOICE: ...all 50 states. Last night, she sang for our donkey basketball game, making us the 26th state in which she has sung. At this time, Janine Stange, who lives in California, is visiting us here this morning, and she is going to open up our announcements and our day by singing our National Anthem. JANINE: ♪ Oh, say, can you ♪ ♪ See, by the dawn's early ♪ ♪ Light... o'er the land ♪ ♪ Of the free, and the ♪ ♪ Home of the brave ♪ (APPLAUSE) JANINE: The next day I traveled to Charleston, SC to perform The Anthem for the Single-A Charleston River Dogs of the South Atlantic League, marking my singing of The Star Spangled Banner in State #27. JANINE: And right after South Carolina, I headed back up to New York to get ready for what would be my most important appearance yet. Quick sidebar. One the questions I'm asked most often is... was I getting compensated for singing The Anthem in all these events. The answer is no. JANINE: I footed the bill for all my travels to the 27 states I'd completed thus far. That's plane tickets, train tickets, rent-a-cars, cabs, clothes, Ubers, busses, hotels, meals, websites, printing my thank you cards for all the troops... all self funded - meaning my own personal savings, credit cards, frequent flyer miles... all of which were getting close to bottoming out. So, back to my most important upcoming appearance. (CITY SOUNDS) JANINE: I was scheduled to appear live on the Fox & Friends morning show on April 14th with 27 states down and 23 still to go. I had just recently Put together a crowdfunding page to A: Make more people aware Of what I was trying to accomplish, and, B: Help raise funds through donations so I can complete my journey by September 14th. (JANINE, IN VIDEO) This is about us, uniting as one nation, for one song, our song, The Star Spangled Banner... so please, help support this mission. Help me get this message out to all 50 states by September 14th, our National anthem's 200th anniversary. JANINE: (NARRATION) An appearance on a nationally-televised morning program could not hurt my chances. HOST: So far, she has checked 27 states off ...hopes to complete her task by this September, when our National Anthem turns 200 years old. 2ND HOST: Joining us now, Janine stange. 2ND HOST: Well, so 27 down. JANINE: Yes. 3RD HOST: We actually have a map right her to take a look at here, so the red indicates those that you have performed in already... you're booked in the pink states... JANINE: Mm-hmm. 3RD HOST: The brown states, you're working on it. Yes. And you're going to make this happen. Why did you start this? JANINE: Really, there's got to be respect, and I think that's what my mission is, is to bring respect and highlight that, so people can say, "You know what? This is an awesome, you know, song." HOST: You've got a job in Los Angeles. How do you find the time? How can you afford to do this? JANINE: I..I don't... it's... amazing that I've been able to do this. I've funded the whole half pretty much by myself. Uh, it's a miracle that I did that... but I need to get done by September 14th, and I need people's help at this point. National exposure can be a beautiful thing. Since I first started, I spent all my time on the phone ...calling places to see if they'd have me to sing The Anthem, and then trying to explain what I was doing and why. And now, I was getting inundated with people contacting me, offering me venues. I remember, I got home from the studio and was up for two days straight, fielding calls and replying to emails. Sitting in my apartment, I felt like an air traffic controller. I had all these flight schedules and maps everywhere, trying to figure out which venues were close to state borders, where the airports were, and how many states I could hit within a two hour radius of my anchor state. And best of all, locking in Anthem performances in states. With a little under 5 months left, and 23 states to go, May, June, and July could literally be described With one word... "Whirlwind". RADIO HOST: We have Janine Stange, and, uh, she's she's attempting to go to all 50 states and sing our National Anthem in every state. Can you tell my listeners, and you viewers on Ustream here, Um, why you're doing this. JANINE: (ON PHONE) I'm doing this because I absolutely love America and I love what The National Anthem represents. It's, um, it's not just a song, it's our song. RADIO HOST: And how many are you up to right now... 27? JANINE: (ON PHONE) 27... JANINE: (ON PHONE) ...yes, tomorrow will be 28. Radio HOST: Tomorrow will be 28? Where are you going tomorrow? JANINE: (ON PHONE) New Mexico. RADIO HOST: Oh, New Mexico! JANINE: May 6th, 2014, JANINE: I sand The Anthem for the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes in Albuquerque, NM. On May 15th, I was in Wisconsin and sang for The University of Milwaukee Panthers baseball team. JANINE: Wisconsin. Something different happened in Wisconsin. After hearing about a study that said one third of all Americans don't know the words to The National Anthem, a Milwaukee reporter from a local new station had me walk up to random people in town and do impromptu duets, to see how many people knew all the words.

Missouri... okay, so I'd never been to this part of the country before, so, as I was driving through the state, I kept looking at all these great views of the countryside, with this big sky and all these cows and horse... they were like paintings... and I kept stopping the car to take pictures for my social media pages. It just so surreal to me... and then, some Missouri Good Samaritan saw me by the side of the road and stopped to see if I needed help. I was, like, "No, I'm just taking pictures of all the cows!" Missouri was also the venue where two local DJ's had me convinced that both snipe hunting and cow tipping were real sports. They even Offered to take me snipe shooting. DJ: ...yeah, snipe hunting's another thing, uh, DJ: Because normally, they... well... JANINE: Oh, a snipe is an animal? Just asking... JANINE: I want to know what a snipe looks like now. DJ: Janine, there's no such thing As snipe. (LAUGHTER) JANINE: Comedians. JANINE: May 26th, Tulsa, okay, was another humbling intersection of sports and patriotism. I sang The Anthem at The Patriot Cup Invitational Golf Tournament, hosted by Folds of Honor. Folds of Honor provides scholarships to children of fallen or disabled heroes. I'll never forget the sight I saw as I was going into the building to sing. JANINE: Two little boys, dressed in patriotic colors, standing at this memorial statue out front. As I walked closer, I realized they weren't just playing around near the statue: They were looking at the names inscribed on it. Looking for A name: Their dad... Who had made the ultimate sacrifice in combat. They were Gold Star Kids. JANINE: While so many kids are eating hot dogs and hamburgers, happy to have a day off of school, these two sons were remembering their dad. Since that day, I use that experience of seeing those two little boys to explain the difference... the very important difference... between Veterans Day and Memorial Day. Veterans Day honors those who served, and are still with us. Memorial Day is for the fallen. Oklahoma, State #33, was also where I was coined for the first time. I was given a challenge coin, which is a medallion bearing a military insignia. My coin was presented to me by American hero, Major Ed Pullido, who lost his leg when he was hit by an IED in 2004. (DOG SLED SOUNDS) JANINE: You'd think my stop in Alaska would be for a dog sledding event, but it was actually singing The Anthem for The Collegiate Summer League baseball game between The Anchorage Bucs and The Glacier Pilots. It was Military Appreciation Day at the ballpark. Also, while I was there, I saw my first ever moose while I was on a sightseeing trip at Katmailand National Park near Anchorage, where I also encountered a slight timing problem. You see, that time of year, it doesn't get dark, so you can lose track of time. I came very close to getting locked inside the park. That was June 8th, in Alaska, State #34. A week later, I marked off Kansas as State #35. I sang The Anthem for The Independent League Kansas City T-Bones. HOST: Welcome to Community America Ballpark. I am Matt Fulks, director of broadcasting & media relations, along with Janine Stange, better known as The National Anthem Girl. HOST: This will be her 35th state out of, you know, about 50. That you're going to try to hit before middle of September. JANINE: That's 15 Left. It's been quite an undertaking. HOST: 9-11 has a huge impact on everyone in this country, but especially has a huge impact on People in New York. JANINE: Yep. HOST: Did that precipitate any of this for you? JANINE: It definitely played a part, absolutely. You know, I was there when it happened. I was actually supposed to be in the city that day. My mom was like, "I don't think you should go.." and I ended up not going, and thank God I'm here today. The National Anthem causes you to think of those things, and, uh, it was tough... you know, and that really drives it home, how important it is for us to be one. What's great about this is, you know, going through every state, you're really promoting awareness, and people are really thinking, "I should tell my kids what this really means," and it's causing a dialogue, that, you know, I'm happy to help, uh, you know, perpetuate. (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) JANINE: So that brings us up to State #36. Oh, my goodness... Wallace, Idaho. I was given the opportunity to sing somewhere very special. I sang The National Anthem from The Center of the Universe. Wallace, Idaho, is this little mining town of about 800 people, and they claim to actually have the center of the universe right there, in the middle of the intersection of Bank and 6th Street. JANINE: So when I got there, I wasn't sure what to expect... but it turned out to be one of the stops that I talk about the most. Elvis joined me on stage. An artist gave me a litho portrait of Marilyn Monroe. And I received a silver coin that was salvaged from The Great Fire of 1910. But when the time came for me to sing The Anthem, it was like something out of a movie. The whole town showed up. It was such an incredible experience: An entire community standing shoulder-to-shoulder To honor America. JANINE: ♪... and the home of ♪ ♪ The brave (CHEERS) When I had gotten there, the organizer of the event, Dave Deroos, said to me, "When you get here, just follow me: And you'll see me, because I'm in a yellow ATV."

JANINE: The Center of the Universe, and my breath of fresh air. Okay... I still had 14 states to go, and a little under 12 weeks to get it done. After I said goodbye to all the nice people in Wallace, I drove back west to Washington State to sing For the class-a Spokane Indians.

And instead, he told from where he had just come... and that was his friend's funeral. He escorted his friend's body home. It was Corporal Justin Clouse. He had given his life for our freedom on June 8th, 2014. This was his friend, and he had just been with all of Justin's family.

And when The Anthem was sung, everyone stopped, stood with their hand over their heart, and sang along. It was such a moving experience... being right there in the middle of what was truly the heart and soul of America. JANINE: (SINGING) ♪ ...that our flag was still ♪ ♪ There ♪ As you might have guessed, July 4th I was somewhere singing The National Anthem. The venue was Red Lodge, MT... and the event... what are the odds... another rodeo. (JANINE VOICE) (JANINE VOICE) ( JANINE VOICE) ( JANINE VOICE) ( JANINE VOICE) (JANINE VOICE) ( COWBOY VOICE) JANINE: The event was great... people were so into it... 4th of July... but something else from my visit to Montana literally stopped me in my tracks. People we coming up to my thank you card table like always... lining up to fill out cards for the troops... and an older man walked up to the table and was watching the others filling out cards: And I could tell their actions meant a lot to him... so I asked, "Did you serve?"...and he looked at me and said, "No, I didn't. And I've Regretted it every day of my life." JANINE: He went on to explain how, when he was 18, several of his friends had gone off to serve, and a lot of them didn't come back. As if on cue, the wind picked up, and the thank you cards began to blow off the table. With tears still in his eyes, he told me he would be back. About 10 minutes later, he came walking back up, and handed me a rock. He said, "This is for you, from Montana with love." He told me he looked for a rock that was shaped like a heart: And he placed it on the pile of thank you cards to keep them from blowing away again. I always say this rock was the most priceless gift anyone gave me on my journey. You may have regrets in your past, but never let that stop you from serving, now or in the future. JANINE: State #40 was Indiana, at the South Shore Car Show in South Shore, IN. State #41 was New Hampshire... my first NASCAR event, singing The Anthem before The Sprint Cup at New Hampshire Motor Speedway.

JANINE: I headed up to Sanford, ME, where I sang for The Sanford Mainers of The New England Summer Collegiate League. Something that never happened before happened there. Broose D'Moose, the Mainers' mascot, made a beeline over to my table and filled out a thank you card for the troops. It was the first time a mascot had ever done that for me: And as crazy as it sounds, that image, of a man dressed as a moose in a baseball uniform, who was pouring his heart out with words that he was writing in that thank you card... it meant so much to me. JANINE: August 2014, my last full month before the deadline, started off with an upper Midwestern bang.

An adorable group of kids... they were all cousins... sang with me on the field. (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) JANINE: That was 3 states, 4 days, 46 states down, and just 4 more to go before September 14th. The end was in sight. State #47 was my first trip ever to Kentucky... to sing for the Triple-A Louisville Bats at Louisville Slugger Field. The Kentucky stop was unique Because I had something that I'd never had before: My own film crew. They followed me around from the moment I landed at the airport. When I saw the footage, all put together, even I was surprised at how much I was cramming into each day on the road. (AIRPORT TERMINAL SOUNDS) (AIRPORT TERMINAL SOUNDS) JANINE: Hi. How cute that is!

I love what it represents. HOST: You think? JANINE: Yeah, I would have to at this point, you know? JANINE: ...what I may do is take my camera out and take a photo of it. (CAMERA CLICK SOUNDS) ...I sang The Anthem from the bleacher section, I just remember everybody looking around, like, "okay, there's somebody singing where is she?..." ...but I wasn't going to not sing The Anthem... phone-calls (LAUGH) a lot of phone-calls, a lot of looking online to see, well, this state, this city, and this state is pretty close to this one, so this could work if I flew in and drove to the other state... it's a lot of logistics...

JANINE: Do you have to leave now? WOMAN: Yeah. JANINE: It's okay I can, we can take... thank you so much. Did you see about that? You can follow me on Facebook and Twitter, okay? The Kentucky venue was also memorable, because between innings, I went into the stands to spend some time with some veterans who were at the game... listening to their stories about serving our country, and getting their viewpoints on what it meant to be a patriot. The most profound of these was a 92 year-old WWII veteran named Cliff, who stormed Normandy on D-Day... and he told me what I believe is the most clear and concise definition that I've ever heard. JANINE: What would you tell the youth of today about America? JANINE: What would you tell them... about this country, would be the advice you'd give them? (CLIFF'S VOICE) (CLIFF'S VOICE) (CLIFF'S VOICE) JANINE: I always pass on his advice... in fact, anyone who asks me about my journey will absolutely hear about Cliff. JANINE: The next day, I was on a plane headed to Michigan, State #48. I sang The Anthem at Comerica Park before a game between The Detroit Tigers and the Seattle Mariners.

JANINE: ...and our flag is still there. JANINE: Also in Hawaii, The Today Show was there to tape an interview segment about my mission... the segment would hopefully air on the day I made it to State #50. (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) (LIVELY STRING MUSIC) JANINE: One state left to go. It almost didn't seem real. Okay, let's take a to recap and fill in some frequently asked questions... JANINE: Where did I come up with the name, 'National Anthem Girl'? JANINE: I was scheduled to sing The Anthem at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego. JANINE: On the way there, traffic was so bad that I barely made it there. Right before I was supposed to go on, I got out of my car, rushed to the stadium entrance, right past all the people in line, and told the gate attendant, "Look, you got to let me in. I'm the National Anthem girl!" And once I got in, I thought two things: One... so much for security, and two... that's a really good name. So, when I got back home, I bough the domain handle and went with it from there. Another question... JANINE: How did you keep things rolling all by yourself? Two words: Social media. Throughout my journey, I was constantly posting to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, to let people know where I was, where I'd be next, which state number I was up to... some nights, depending on what time zone I was in, I'd wake up at 3 a.m., with one eye open, just to update any status for the next event. I don't what I would do if I was only able to rely on faxing press releases or calling people, because I was on a plane or driving most of the time. And it was because of social media that Heather Nauert from Fox News caught wind of my goal and shared it with her producers, which culminated in my appearance on Fox & Friends, which wound up being the turning point in the national awareness for my journey. If it wasn't for this little device, I might not have made it. Next question... JANINE: After 2 years promoting The Anthem, did I receive many marriage proposals along the way? Yes, I did. (SILENCE) (SILENCE) Question... JANINE: After performing The Anthem so far in 49 states, after 2 very intense years, how does it feel to finally get to the finish line with State #50? It feels like I've truly seen the real America. On 49 separate occasions, I performed our song for the people that make up this nation. At every ballpark, every speedway, every basketball court, every hockey rink, every rodeo arena, I would always look in the stands to see people who understood that regardless of what team they wanted to win, and which politician they would vote for, in the 90 seconds it took for The Anthem to be sung, we were all as one... one home... one voice... on nation under God. Every now and then, I'd look up and see some young person not singing along, looking around like they were bored... and I prayed that kid would have someone in their life to just explain to them just why this song was so important... that this song, it's not a formality, and singing it is not something we have to do, but it's something we get to do. Other times, I'd look up and see a person with a certain look in their eye, and their hand over their heart, rendering a salute, and you could tell they had served, or were close to someone who had. These were the people I would focus on while I would sing. JANINE: After one performance, a veteran came up to me and said, "Thank you for singing The Anthem the way it was meant to be sung." And I looked at him and said, "Oh my gosh, like, you served. It's because of you that I can even sing this song." I also got to see, up close and personal, the debt of gratitude that Americans feel for those who put their lives on the line every day to protect us... GIRL'S VOICE: Thank you so much for being so brave... you kept us so safe... MAN'S VOICE:...thank you for your service, and may God richly bless you, your family, your... Fellow service personnel... WOMAN'S VOICE: From the bottom of my heart for your sacrifice... And love for our country... GIRL'S VOICE: Thank you for keeping our country safe. You're my hero! JANINE: So yeah, I've seen America, and I've learned two things: America is beautiful, and Americans are beautiful. Because, at the end of the day, what I've witnessed on this journey is that we're a country of dreamers, and we're also fighters. Deep down, we all want what's best for our country, and especially for the next generation. JANINE: Last question... JANINE: Who or what was your motivation? I believe I did it for the heroes... the men and women who sacrifice everything to serve our country, believing in something bigger than themselves... I remember their faces... World War 2, Korean War, Desert Storm... Vietnam veterans, the Purple Heart recipients... the worried, yet proud, faces of dads and moms, brothers and sisters whose loved ones were currently deployed... the Gold Star parents... they made a mark on my life... I'll never be same as a result of meeting these people... And I did it for the people of America, the ones who needed a gentle reminder that we're all in this together, and that freedom is not free. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) JANINE: And I did it for my mother, Patty, who passed away from breast cancer in 2011. JANINE: How much do I wish she could have been here to see all that's happened these last 2 years. She was the kind of mother who would've slapped me silly if I wasn't using my gifts to give to others in some way. My mother never told me to do something patriotic. She showed me by example. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) (SOFT PIANO/STRING MUSIC) (SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE) RADIO HOST:...Jersey girls in the house, studio filling up, and now the beautiful Janine Stange is in our nook... RADIO HOST: All right, you probably have heard this name a lot, especially in the last few weeks, as her journey has come to fruition... everything she has dedicated the last 2 years to is finally culminated in this last week... on this 2 year journey to sing The National Anthem in all 50 states. RADIO HOST: Now, Janine, where did this idea come from? JANINE: I just always loved singing The National Anthem. I sang it since I was in high school. I always wanted to do something to give back, so, I realized nobody ever sang in all 50 states... RADIO HOST: Nobody had ever done that before? JANINE: No. Now I understand why nobody's ever Done it. (LAUGHS) JANINE: Tennessee... State #50. The end of the road. This was it. As my plane was landing in Nashville, I remember thinking to myself, "This is the last time I'll ever mention the name of a state with a number attached to it." So, my journey would end on August 28th at LP Stadium in Nashville, TN, singing The National Anthem before The Tennessee Titans played The Minnesota Vikings. JANINE: As usual, my day started out early, doing interviews ...meeting with local media. RADIO HOST: Janine is going for singing The National Anthem in all 50 states tonight at the Titans Game... the state of Tennessee is #50. JANINE: That's right. RADIO HOST: So by state #50, it's pretty easy to get a National Anthem gig somewhere in the state of Tennessee? JANINE: Yeah, it wasn't that difficult. I'm very happy to be, you know, singing for the Titans, it's a big deal. RADIO HOST: So the response has been really good everywhere you've gone? JANINE: Yeah, and you know what I love about it? It's because they, uh, the people are really embracing this whole concept of, you know, being grateful, attaching the meaning of The National Anthem to the people who represent it. It's a good thing that the media is really catching on, because it shows that we really are behind our troops... and I love that. TV HOSTESS:... but you have now traveled to sing at all of these big Games in all the states, and you are wrapping it up tonight right here in Nashville. JANINE: Yeah. I'm so excited... #50! RADIO HOSTESS: I know. How are you feeling? I mean are you feeling, your like, probably a little bit of relief that this is it? JANINE: Sentimental. I was even awarded the flag of Tennessee by the Governor's office. OFFICIAL: This is to certify that the accompanying flag of the state of Tennessee ...this flag that I'm holding... has been flown over The Tennessee state capitol for you, Janine stange. JANINE: Aww. (UPBEAT MUSIC) JANINE: I was so busy, that what was about to happen hadn't really registered yet. I just told myself this was like every other state so things would feel as normal as possible. After a full day of promoting, I was all ready to take my last trip to the middle of a field to sing our anthem in my 50th state. Did I mention there was not a cloud in the sky all day? RADIO VOICE #1: Currently, it's 85 degrees. Clear skies expected to continue into this evening... RADIO VOICE #2: Your Nashville weather today: Clear, dry and plenty of sunshine... RADIO VOICE #3: If you're heading out to LP tonight to see The Titans face The Vikings, it's going to be a hot one. Clear skies in the forecast... (JANINE'S VOICE) (JANINE'S VOICE) (JANINE'S VOICE) (HOSTESS' VOICE) (JANINE'S VOICE) JANINE: When I went down for sound check, everything was clear... but then, as I stood on the sideline, minutes before I was scheduled to sing, storm clouds rolled over... then, a few raindrops...

Despite the fact that I was literally getting drenched and fighting the wind to keep the hair out of my face, I knew that my mission was accomplished. Two years ago, when I started this journey, never did I imagine it would be such a life-changing experience.

Some photographs came out from those moments, with the rain suspended all around me. Someone posted a comment, saying, 'The raindrops were tears of joy from Heaven.' I'd like to think they were my mom... wanting me to know she had gotten my message.
