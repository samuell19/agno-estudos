(MultiCom Jingle) (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) - My name is Josh Kirby. I was just your average 9th grader, my biggest problem was getting good grades. And my idea of excitement was racing my bicycle. (school bell ringing) Yes! I never thought time would catch up with me. But I couldn't have imagined, (train horn blaring) that hundreds of years from now, mankind would invent The Nullifier, a device capable of controlling, or destroying the Universe. - [Alien] Prepare for the storm. - [Josh] A scientist named Irwin 1138, tried to disassemble and hide The Nullifier, but even he couldn't stop-- - [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope! (laser guns firing) (triumphant orchestral music) - [Dr. Zoetrope] Give me The Nullifier! - [Irwin] You are too late, Zoetrope! - [Dr. Zoetrope] It's never too late for me! - Irwin and Zoetrope have been chasing each other across the Time Stream, trying to be the first to find The Nullifier's pieces. This time, they're gonna land in 1995. The place, my front yard! Now, I'm going along for the ride of all time! What's goin' on, well where are we? - [Irwin] I hope you're prepared to do battle, young man. This will be a war through time, and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners! (frenetic orchestral music) - [Josh] We've got help from a Warrior! - My name is Azabeth Siege. - Oh, she's amazing! And a magical creature called Prism to show us the way. Together we're on a quest through time, visiting different worlds to fight for The Nullifier's pieces. - [Dr. Zoetrope] I'm obviously in the right place, and the right time. - Because if Zoetrope ever assembles The Nullifier, he'll conquer time itself. I've gotta try and save the Universe. (triumphant orchestral music) I was just a 14 year-old kid before my adventure began, but now I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (triumphant orchestral music) (moves into mellow orchestral music) - [Narrator] On the last chapter of Josh Kirby... Time Warrior! - Oh, oh! Whoa! (leaves crunching) - I have tried every trick in the time travel book to locate Josh. There is the off chance that Zoetrope's slightly superior intellect may enhance his ability to pinpoint Josh's location. - Josh and I are going into Nightmare Forest. - Nightmare Forest? - [Dr. Zoetrope] It's true, he is a Time Warrior. - Well, I say we take care of that big bully once and for all! (suspenseful orchestral music) - I'd love to stay everyone, but there are three more of these deadly components gone down. Hey, Dr. Zoetrope's after us! (spaceship banging) - Commencing efficiency action! (bombs exploding) - Turn the pod around! - What? We're not turning! (train horn blaring) - What are you waiting for? Go ahead and use one of your one-in-a-billion Time Warrior powers and save us! (ethereal orchestral music) (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) - By the Codes of Kang, Irwin do something! - Do something! Pull off, pull off! - I'm trying, I'm trying! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Zoetrope's right behind us! Look, where I come from, if a machine goes nuts, there's only one sure-fire method of repair! (strains) (straining) Whoa! Whoa! (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) (train horn blaring) (screaming) We did it! - We did it? We did it? - We did it. - [Irwin] We did it, we did it, we did it! - We did it! We did it! We-- (groans) - Do not let your emotions get the better of you, Josh Kirby! - We were almost blown to smithereens! - And I am certain we will almost be again, but I hardly think that's appropriate behavior for a Warrior! - Warrior? What Warrior? I'm a 9th grader! Woo-hoo! - Yeah, we did it! We did it! I did it! Oh, I am now the first smartest man in the Galaxy, in the Universe, in the 25th Century, in the whole of the Time Stream! As it should be! (laughs) Oh, who knew that victory could taste this sweet! Oh, fare thee well you no good-- - Irwin! - Yes, yes Josh? - Look, the guy's dead, should we really be celebrating? Look, I know he was a crumb and all but... - Josh, my boy! That no goodnik Zoetrope threatened to destroy all of time, just for his own selfish end! He showed no compassion, or remorse, as he went through and destroyed Galaxy, after Galaxy. Why should I? - While I agree with you, we must also respect the souls of soldiers who died in battle fighting for their cause, good or bad, as the case may be! - But you two are acting as if he was on some kind of noble quest, and not on a mission to decimate the Time Stream! His demise, untimely as it may seem, is cosmic Karma! (Prism purring and chattering) Surely there's a Code of Kang in here somewhere! Come on everybody, let's pat ourselves on the back, we saved time! - That is true! But there is still much damage to correct throughout the Time Stream, and time is wasting! - Excuse me, can we at least catch our breath? Come on Beth! - Azabeth, Josh Kirby. Azabeth, I do not call you Osh Kirby! - Yeah, thank Kang for small favors. Is it really that hard to relax? - I will relax when the Time Stream is back in order, when my debt to you is repaid, and when I am back with my own people. - Yeah, and all this time I thought you some kind of crush on me, or something! (mellow orchestral music) - Well, everything's back to normal again, it seems. (alarm blaring) - Now, what is that? - Uh-oh, clogged intake valve, hmm. Must have time barnacles. All right Josh, come on, cut the forward thrusters. - Um, time barnacles, huh? I thought they only grew in the ocean. - No, no, no, no, no. No, they're living organisms which are indigenous to the Time Stream. It seems that they're drawn to all kinds of warm surfaces, particularly to our intake valves. - It looks as if there's eggs stuck in the barnacles it... - Whoa, look at the size of those suckers! - I've never seen anything like these eggs before. Better get them in to inspect them. - Are you certain that is the correct procedure? After all, we have no idea what reaction these alien eggs will have to the oxygenated atmosphere of the Time Pod. - Yeah lady, think what we could learn from examining these eggs! Besides, we'll have to clean out the intake valve anyway. - Yeah, would you let the man do his job! I mean, after all, they look pretty cool! - Bring 'em in Josh. (ethereal orchestral music) (eggs squeaking and purring) (device beeping and ringing) Amazing! According to my reading, these eggs date at 70 million years BC! - Wow! They're like pre, pre, prehistoric eggs! They must of gotten sucked into hyper-time, and then attached to those time barnacles. - I suggest we proceed with caution. (eggs squeaking and purring) - What's that noise? (Prism chattering) What's up, buddy? - The eggs, they're moving! - No, they're hatching! (eggs squeaking and purring) (suspenseful orchestral music) (worms purring and chattering) (whimsical orchestral music) (Prism chattering) - Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong with Prism? - Oh, he remembers Bartholomew. - Bartholo-who? - Bartholomew. My boa constrictor. You see, before I made your acquaintances, I kept a pet snake. The deluded creature once tried to ingest Prism. Whole. (mellow orchestral music) Since then, anything that wriggles gives Prism the heebie-jeebies. (whimsical orchestral music) - Oh, this is too cool! Wow! - Amazing! Look how they interact, even at infancy. - Not to worry, Prism. (whimsical orchestral music) They seem harmless enough. (chuckles) I must apologize, it appears I was mistaken. - Mistaken? No, it happens all the time. Not to me, of course. (worms cooing and chattering) - Oh, come on. Come on! (whimsical orchestral music) - Look at him! (laughing) He's a girl! (laughing) Hey, where you goin' to? (worm cooing and chattering) - Oh, oh, oh! (screams) (screaming) - What's happening? Get off of her! - Oh, it's tickling me! It's tickling me and I can't stop! (screams) - Give her to me, here, here, here, here, here, here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, settle down, settle down! Hey, why'd you do that? How 'bout that? A fate worse than death! Hey, here come here. Come here, oh buddy. Oh, you're heavy! Hey, where're you from, little guy? (Prism chattering) (Prism groaning) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Solid titanium! - Those little critters... (worms cooing and chattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) (electrical arcing) (alarm blaring) - Are feeding on the Time Pod! - Oh no! (frenetic orchestral music) (alarm blaring) - Where are they now? - They're everywhere! (alarm blaring) (frenetic orchestral music) - That's awful, they're eating everything! - Oh, are there any other intellectual observations you'd like to make? - Hey, what are we gonna do? - I'm thinking, I'm thinking! - Well think harder, we're in trouble! - We're losing control! (engine exploding) (frenetic orchestral music) (electrics arcing) (alarm blaring) - The structural frame of the Time Pod, if that goes, we're doomed! (alarm blaring) - They're going after The Nullifier pieces! (frenetic orchestral music) (laughing) - No, they musn't get hold of The Nullifier components! - Rip. Your. Head. Off! (laughing and screaming) - (groans) Ow! - Thank you very much, Josh Kirby! I hope to repay you for the favor some day! - Josh, for all our sakes come and grab this arm, we're losing our trajectory! Grab the arm! (alarm blaring) (cosmic shocking) - Oh-Oh! (alarm blaring) - Wait, crash positions everybody, hold on! - Quick, under the console, hurry! - Josh, put her next to the Time Pod! - No! Oh God! (screaming) (cosmic thrusting) (Time Pod crashing) (alarm weakly sounding) (whimsical orchestral music) (door crashing and hissing) (worms chattering and purring) (dramatic orchestral music) (worms chattering) - Even this cold doesn't stop them! - Yeah, how nice for them. - This cold is somehow familiar. (ethereal orchestral music) (metal creaking and crashing) - My beautiful Time Pod! Ruined! (whimsical orchestral music) Time hopping leeches! (screams) Oh! Oh! The years. The sacrifice. (mellow orchestral music) Alas, poor Time Pod. I knew its ratios. (mellow orchestral music) Unfortunately, this little development terminates our objective. Totally. Unequivocally. - You mean we're stuck here? - Only slaves, forever! (worms cooing and chattering) - Hey, they're getting away! - Good riddance to bad rubbish. (mellow orchestral music) - Maybe all is not for not. This building is somehow familiar. (suspenseful orchestral music) (guns cocking) - [Soldier] There they are! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Azabeth Siege! Where in the 12 moons of Meagan have you been? - Sir, I beg your forgiveness for my untimely departure, and I pray that my actions will not be deemed treasonous to the Codes of Kang, nor his followers. - Azabeth, who's this clown? - Show some respect, Josh Kirby! This is Akira Storm, Leader of a Thousand, and keeper of the 21 Codes of Kang. - Oh! - Stand woman, and give me a look at you. There's no suspicion of treason to the great resistance, we give humble thanks to the all-knowing Kang for bringing you safely back into the fold. We all feared for the worst when you did not return, and now, such a dramatic entrance, and at no great expense to our secured perimeters. - Quite honestly, my arrival here was totally by accident. We had been wandering through the Time Stream for what seemed like an eternity, when we happened upon a nest of worm's eggs. - Worm eggs? - The eggs hatched a pod of worms, which ate entirely through the Time Pod in which I was traveling. - Metal-eating worms from the Time Stream? Come now. - I swear it by Kang! - So, where are these worms now? - They seemed to have burrowed through into the bedrock. - And how are they to be terminated? - I'm at a loss for a solution. - Maybe you could kill 'em with all that hot air. - Silence! - They are with me. - With you? - Josh Kirby, the young one, saved my life. - Oh, he did, did he? - He's no older than a pup! - Barely older than you when you joined the Great Resistance. - You compare me to a human? I fear your time spent away from our struggle was not the most productive of your life. - Nonetheless, I am home now, and all by their good graces! - Very well then. We must discuss battle strategies at once. Dreadnaught the Enslaver and his forces have had us under constant siege since your depart. There's much I have to brief you on, let us hurry! - But Commander, about the worms I-- - I'm afraid there are far more pressing battles to be won before we can worry about these, ah, worms. - I-- - I don't know how much longer we can hold Dreadnaught at bay. Craygar, Valtan! Secure the breach to the exterior walls, stable the humans in the brig then-- - Stable the humans? - [Soldier] Come on! - Excuse me? - Akira! - [Soldier] We should search for weapons. - Commander Storm, they are with me! - And we are at war, and I cannot compromise this station by allowing two humans to remain free, humans who already infected this battle station with some type of a metal-corroding parasite. - Hey! That was an accident those things got loose! - For all we know, they could be spies for Dreadnaught himself. - Commander! - Our last military installation is on the brink of collapse, and you wanna argue about a couple of humans? I will have none of this, do you understand me? - You are the keeper of the 21 Codes of Kang, I will obey your orders. - What? How can you do this to us? - I am bound by duty, and the Codes of-- - Codes of Kang to do so, right? Yeah, I know. Is this how I'm repaid for saving your life? - I will do what I can with Akira, but we are at war. - Take them away! Let's go! - [Soldier] Take his pack! What have we got here? (Prism chattering) - What is going on now? - [Soldier] Sir, I think you should have a look at this. (Prism chattering) - Yet another infiltrator to undermine our defenses. Take this malignancy into custody, no doubt the brains of the operation. - What? Brains? Him? (wind howling) - Just as I suspected, they're smuggling weapons into our complex. - No, no, no, no, no, that is not a weapon! Well I mean, not yet. We have got to find the other Nullifier pieces-- - Nullifier? I've heard quite enough, take them to the brig immediately! Scoddin, take this to our science officer at once! - [Scoddin] Yes, sir! (militaristic orchestral music) - [Soldier] Move along! (militaristic orchestral music) (moves into ethereal orchestral music) (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) (metal crashing) (groaning) (suspenseful orchestral music) (straining and groaning) (mellow orchestral music) - I hate you! (metal clanging) Blast you! Cold and uncaring as ever! Untouched, while those who follow your call stand at the brink of ruin and death! Well, I am here to tell you, I am not going to stand with them! (glass shattering) (mellow orchestral music) I've come to renounce you, Kang. Ever since I've been with the humans, all I've been able to think about was getting back here, to my people. (mellow orchestral music) To the home of Kang, the Great Liberator! Well, now I wish I'd never come back! I'm going to leave this place and this time, I'm not coming back! (mellow orchestral music) Your home is where you choose to live, and I cannot live in a place where my friends are thrown into a prison cell because of some 100 year-old prejudice. I'm going to liberate my friends, and we are going to find a way off this planet. I'm half human. Maybe I'll go live with Josh Kirby on his Earth, after we've repaired the Time Stream. (mellow orchestral music) As he would say, "I'm outta here!" (bomb exploding) Oh! (mellow orchestral music) Why have the Codes, which have done so much good for my people, serve the humans so poorly? (mellow orchestral music) And why does this cold planet have such a hold over my heart? (mellow orchestral music) I know I can't leave! But I also know I cannot stand here and live with this injustice! (mellow orchestral music) - Josh, will you stop that? - Don't look at me. (Prism purring and chattering) (bomb exploding) How are we gonna get outta here? - Oh-ho, how are we going to get out of this time? - Stuck on a planet full of Azabeths. Not that that's all bad, I want you to know. But some of these people are colder than an ice box in Antarctica. - They don't hold us in high regard either. - (exhales) Well, I just wanna go home. I wanna see if my dad's all right. And my friends. I wanna change my clothes! And how many twisted time periods can someone save wearing the same clothes? Not that many! (straining) These bars are as tough as steel! - Tougher than steel. - Oh, hello there Benedict Arnold! - I do not understand this sarcasm. - Well how 'bout this one? Hi, you traitor! - I told you that I would do all that I could, but Akira is in a difficult position, and my absence from the fight may have jeopardized the situation even further. - Yeah, I'll bet. - I must abide by his decisions. Our forces have put up an admirable fight, but Dreadnaught pushes ever closer to enslaving my people! This battle station is our last hope! If Dreadnaught succeeds in breaching the walls of this fortress, then the last free survivors of my people will be prey to his vile plans! - So, let us help! Irwin is now the first most brilliant man of the 25th century. - Yes, Josh is quite right. I mean that is, we could be of invaluable service to your fight. - I'm afraid you don't know my people very well. Very headstrong. - Oh, no! - And very wary of outsiders! It was the colonization of the planet by humans that led to the original enslavement in the 25th century. Kang freed my people, and he set about laws which were intended to keep us free! But now, Dreadnaught threatens to destroy all that we have ever worked for! We will not be enslaved again! I am sorry that I have let you down, but I want you to know that I continue to honor my debt to you, Josh Kirby. - I can tell. - Do you know that you could of been detained outside where the temperature is 30 degrees below zero? - Oh, well! That's cold blooded! - Any sign of those worms from 70 million BC? - I'm afraid not. - Well, maybe that's a good sign, they could of dug deep into the bedrock of the planet and made themselves a nest there. - Or they could be weakening the foundation of our installation as we speak, and bring us crashing into the center of the Earth with them! - No, that would seem highly unlikely. - With you two around, nothing I could imagine is highly unlikely! - Azabeth, could you tell me about the timeline inconsistency in your era? - No. - Why not? You can trust us! - Look Azabeth, please! You must know how the timeline has been altered here. - I only meant to say that there are no inconsistencies to report. - What? But every place we've been to so far has reported gross abnormalities in the Time Stream continuum. - I have noticed nothing here to support the Zoetrope Time Continuum Effect! - Do not refer to it by that name ever again! It is not his continuum to affect! So, it follows suit that he certainly doesn't deserve any credit on time theories derived from it! Ugh, even in death he continues to haunt me! - Wait a second. I thought that everything that existed before the time scramble was supposed to be freaked outta control. Right? I mean, maybe we did it! Maybe we fixed the time continuum! - I wouldn't count on it, lad. A more probable hypothesis is that Azabeth's world was actually created as a result of the time scramble, as you call it. - What are you saying? - Maybe this place would never have existed were it not for Zoetrope's evil plan. - That is madness, my people have been around for millennia! - Millennia, seconds. (clicks) What's the difference? - Well, at least Zoetrope did one thing right. - Look, I entirely understand the position you're in, but you simply have to get us out of here! For every second we waste away in this cell, some buffoon could be tampering with The Nullifier pieces to disastrous effect! - Seconds, millennia. (clicks) What's the difference? - Azabeth. Time is running out. - (sighs) I'll see what I can do. - Well, gotta look on the bright side. - I wasn't aware that there is one. - Well, we don't have to watch our backs for that slime ball Zoetrope anymore. (exhaling) (suspenseful orchestral music) - What a way to go, impaled on an alien cactus. Of all the rotten luck in the Galaxy, I cannot believe. Hey! (creature growling) I am not dead yet you scavengers! (Zoetrope groaning) (creature growling) Ow! (suspenseful orchestral music) Hey. Hey! Come back! Come back! (soldiers chattering) (transformer exploding) (electrical arcing) - Miss the thrill of battle? - Believe me, I've had my share of battles in the Time Stream. - The Shibonian shields are losing their power at a rate of 17% per quarter, sir. - Divert one-half the auxiliary cells to shield power, and restrict all non-delineated sources through the auxiliary house until further notice. - Yes, sir. - Our cargo bay is reporting massive disruption, and disincorporation on three quarters of our operational fleet. - Disincorporation? Justify. - Well sir... - Yes? - The ships have been eaten, sir. - What? - That's what they report, sir. - All right then, quarantine the cargo bay at once, and disinfect the entire hanger from top to bottom. - [Female Soldier] Yes, sir. - Compliments of your Josh Kirby, no doubt. - It was an accident, Commander! - Aye, one that might cost us our freedom. (metal snapping) Ah! (distant laser guns firing) (whimsical orchestral music) - Come on, let us outta here! - Oh give it a rest! You can't bend the bars with your bare hands. - Well, we've gotta do something. They could keep us in this cage forever! I won't make it to the junior prom, I won't even make it to high school! (dramatic orchestral music) Oh, forget about it. (dramatic orchestral music) (cosmic whooshing) (dramatic orchestral music) - These bars were solid steel! - Were is right, now they're as rusty as my dad's old pickup truck. - This section here is still in tact, these where your hands were are as old and brittle as bones. - How'd it happen? - You did it! - Me? - Yes, you! Of course, you did it! This must be another power of a Time Warrior. We've yet to even begin to tap into your abilities, young man! It appears you can bend time with your touch. - I don't get it, I mean, what did I do? - Well you see, your simple act of will manifested a temporal acceleration of the latent protoelec-- - In English, please! - When you touched the bars, you made the metal age at an incredible rate, causing them to rust and corrode in a matter of seconds. - Oh, get outta here! - Well now, my boy, we can! Come on, you can use your new powers to help Azabeth. - Oh, no I can't, not for a while at least. 12 hours, remember? - Oh yes, you discovered a Time Warrior can only use his abilities once every 12 hours. (bomb exploding) - Oh man, it sounds like they're taking a beating up there. - Yeah, so let's go help them! - Yeah, Azabeth needs me. - Thatta boy! (triumphant orchestral music) - [Josh] Let's go! (triumphant orchestral music) (Prism purring and chattering) (cosmic whooshing) (somber orchestral music) (worm cooing and chattering) (soldier gasping) (suspenseful orchestral music) (soldier groaning) - This is Sentry Fallon, I spotted them, sir, I spotted the worms! - [Akira] What's their direction? - Traveling west towards the brig, sir. - [Akira] They're in cahoots with that Josh Kirby, I knew it! Keep me posted as to their whereabouts, and try and cut them off at Sector 11. - Will do, sir, I-- (metal clanging) (electrical arcing) (creature growling and grunting) - [Zoetrope] Come on. Come on, boy. (creature growling and grunting) Nice tasty biscuit, just gimme a hand. Come on, you can do it! You can do it. Just gimme a hand, and you can have the biscuit. Ooh, ooh, that's it! (creature growling and grunting) (sniffing) Mmm, smells good, ooh. (hand slapping) Ouch! (creature growling and grunting) Come on! Come on! Come on, nice fresh tomato biscuit, hard as a rock. It's good for your teeth, though! Come on, ooh, it's delicious. My, what strong lookin' shoulders you have. Oops! (grunting and struggling) (dramatic orchestral music) Yeah, yeah you can have the other half, after you get these splinters out of my back! (distant laser guns firing) (bomb exploding) (glass shattering) - So much misery these days, and so much mistrust. (metal shattering) (exhaling) You've outdone yourself this time, Josh Kirby. But what can I do to help you now? Akira would never understand your methods, nor would he tolerate our wisecracks. I barely do. (distant laser guns firing) But I do owe you my life, Josh Kirby, and I will see to it that you are freed as well! (groaning) Just as soon as I free myself! (metal creaking and crashing) Ooh, those abominable worms! (grunting) (buzzer buzzing) I will get you for this, Josh Kirby! (cosmic whooshing) (dramatic orchestral music) (soldiers chattering) - Do you really think you can fend off me, Dreadnaught the Enslaver, for very much longer? - For as long as it takes. (transformer exploding) (electrical arcing) (laughing) - But no luck to your defense shields, that won't be long. (electrical arcing) - Now you listen to me! (metal creaking and shattering) - (laughs) No, you listen to me! You can barely keep your equipment together, let alone defender for all your people! I offer you a choice, Akira Storm, the Leader of a Thousand. This is your last chance. Say the word, and Ill call off the attack and spare your people. In exchange for them agreeing to be my slaves for the rest of their days, of course. - That is no choice. - Precisely! (door whirring) Oh! The lovely, and volatile Miss Siege! Oh, how I'm going to enjoy owning you! Come on! (laughing) (energetic orchestral music) - [Soldier] Be careful! - What? - End holographic transmission, sir. - I can see that, thank you! (distant laser guns firing) And what do you want? - I'd like to have a word with you, regarding Josh Kirby. - Why, is there something else of mine he'd like to destroy? (ethereal orchestral music) (worm chattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) - They're swarming all around us. Do you think they've discovered that we're gone? - They're too engrossed with The Enslaver to worry about us, yet. (Prism cooing and chattering) - [Josh] What's with Prism? (Prism cooing and chattering) - He's not lit up this brightly since - The last Nullifier piece! - The last Nullifier piece! It must be down the worm hole. - I think the worms are attracted to The Nullifier, too. - Just like rats to cheese! - [Soldier] It must be coming from over there. - Where? - Right off there. - On the wall there? - [Soldier] Yes. - Quick, down the worm hole. (suspenseful orchestral music) Come on! - You all right, Josh? I'm coming down! All right, Prism! Prism, close your eyes! - Jump! (Prism cooing and chattering) - Good! Josh, this is the ventilation system, this will give us access to the entire fortress! (dramatic orchestral music) (creature grunting and cooing) (creature cooing) (creature growling and grunting) (Prism cooing and chattering) - Well, we've gotta be close. (Prism cooing and chattering) Maybe up here. (Prism cooing and chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) - Will you look at that! - It's okay, Prism. I think. Look the worms are glued to The Nullifier piece. Just like moths to a flame! - Being close to The Nullifier component seems to have sequestered their appetite. - That's it! - That's it, what's it? I've heard your "That's it," before. - I have a plan! - Oh-ho no, I thought I was supposed to be the brains of this outfit! - Look I'm telling you, I know how to round up all the worms before they can do anymore damage! First I need Azabeth. - How? If the guards see us, they'll throw us back into the brig! - You're the brains of this outfit, you figure it out. Let's go! (worms cooing and purring) - I have more than proven myself to this squadron and to the Laws of Kang! I demand that you release Josh Kirby and the others immediately! - You are in no position to demand anything, young lady! - I am not a young lady, Commander! I am a Warrior, and I shall be treated as one! - And where did you acquire such insolence for your Commanding Officers, hmm? Surely that is not of the ways of Kang. - Uh-Oh! - You sure? - Of course I'm sure! My keen sense of direction has no equal in this, or any century, anymore. Well, maybe this way. - [Azabeth] How dare you! - Do you hear that? - Yes! - [Akira] I cannot believe you are even saying these words! These humans have been here less than 12 hours, and they've already caused as much damage as Dreadnaught's entire army! They will be confined to the brig until I decide otherwise, is that clear? - I cannot stand idly by as my friends, who have proven their worth and valor many times over, rot away in some jail cell! - Compassion for humans? Isn't this a pretty little turn of events? My how you've changed! I barely know you at all Azabeth Siege, my betrothed. - Wait a minute! She's gonna marry that tweeb? - Shhh! - I have changed. How could I not when I've been exposed to ideals and worlds that you haven't even dreamed of? - And what of these ideals have you seen? - That we have been hardened, conditioned by centuries of fighting and conflict. (bomb exploding) - Our ways are suddenly barbaric to you? Maybe you would prefer the life of a slave! - That is not my point! I am a Warrior, be it in this time, or any other! But what I have learned is that not everything can be solved through the slash of a sword, or the blast of a fist! - And this Josh Kirby of yours, he's taught you all these things that I could not understand? This child? - Have you forgotten the 10th Code of Kang? "One who is young in years, may be old in wisdom." This child, is wiser than many I have known who are twice his age. - You dare quote the sacred Codes to me? This discussion is finished! - You must release them! - [Akira] And if I refuse? - Then you will prove to all that can hear that the mighty Leader of a Thousand is blinded by petty jealousy. - Me, jealous of that twerp? - I owe that twerp my life. - Regardless, we are in a combat situation, and all full-blooded humans will be confined to the brig until further notice. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to save my planet! - Caloong on star! (ominous orchestral music) - Excuse me? - I said caloong on star. (ominous orchestral music) I demand a Request of Honor. If you will not honor my request for my friend's freedom, then you leave me no choice. - Are you mad? - I am not. - So be it. Prepare the arena! Caloong on star. (screaming) - Oh! - Oh! Now I think they'll know we've escaped. (Prism whimpering and chattering) (worms cooing and chattering) - Oh, this is great, this is just great! Go to jail, right? Go directly to jail! Do not pass go, and do not collect $200.00. - Take them away! - Now wait! You gotta listen to us, all right? We found a way to-- - Silence! Your interference has disrupted my plans long enough! Besides, Azabeth has bespoken a request on your behalf, you're free to go until the time of the testament. I must go prepare, farewell my love. When next we meet, 'twill be for the last time. - Jeez! - Jeez Louise! What was that all about? Is that guy a killjoy or what? All it was was a little request. - No! No little request. The Request for Honor is a sacred method among my people of defending one's convictions, it is a fight to the death. - That is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard you say, and trust me, you've come up with some doozies in your day! Fight to the death? There's no way I... You can't do it! - I must. - No! You march right back to your quarters, young lady! You can't fight with that guy, he'll murder you! - I agree with Josh! We'll just place ourselves under house arrest. - The request has been sealed, and Akira's honor as a commander is at stake here. Noble though your intentions may be, I'm obligated to fight anyway. - What? (ominous orchestral music) - Azabeth! (ominous orchestral music) I can't honestly believe you're going through with this. - I honestly have no alternative. It is the way of my people. I'm fighting for your freedom. It is no less than what you would do for me. - Yeah, but Azabeth! - Isn't it? - I wanna help you. - Then say a prayer. (ominous orchestral music) (moves into energetic orchestral music) - [Spectator] Akira! Strike the first blow! - I can't use my powers to help Azabeth, it's only been eight hours, not enough time's gone by! - All we can do now, is watch. Come on, Prism. (spectators chattering) (horns blaring) - [Spectator] Okay, all right! (ominous orchestral music) - May Kang be at your side. - And at yours. (ominous orchestral music) - [Spectator] Let's go! (Prism chattering) (suspenseful orchestral music) (spectators yelling and cheering) (metal clanging) (suspenseful orchestral music) (spectators cheering) (grunting and straining) - Congratulations, Commander, you struck first blood. - You've gone soft in your time spent with the humans, you would not so easily of lowered your guard before. - I'm glad my wound amuses you. - I am not amused! Your wound pains me twice as deeply as it does you, but your insolence towards the Keeper of the Codes cannot go unpunished! - And your arrogance must not go unchecked! (frenetic orchestral music) (spectators cheering) I think you've forgotten the 11th Code of Kang, Akira! "An arrogant leader defeats his purposes." (frenetic orchestral music) (spectators cheering) (swords clanging) (grunting and screaming) (frenetic orchestral music) (swords clanging) (screaming triumphantly) (spectators cheering) - I wonder, would you fight so vehemently for my affections as you do the young Josh Kirby? - I don't fight for his affections, you simple-minded dolt! I fight for his freedom! - Ee-yah! (groaning) (crowd cheering and whistling) You should never of come home, Azabeth. (groaning and straining) (frenetic orchestral music) - Azabeth! - Code of Kang number 17, "If you're going to strike, strike don't talk." (suspenseful orchestral music) - Do it. - The caloong on star has ended, I demand the freedom of Josh Kirby and his companions. - It shall be done! (crowd cheering) (clapping) Do it! - There are far more productive uses of my strength at this moment, and for all our sakes, we need your strength as well. Rise Commander, while we still have a chance! - I beg of you, do not let me live a weakened man. - You will only be a weakened man if you desert your people when they need you most. (suspenseful orchestral music) (door whirring) Dreadnaught has penetrated the second level of our western shields, even the third level has reported damage. Your people need you more now than they ever have. - My people need a leader with a strong heart, and a clear head, I no longer fit that description. - You are one of the finest Warriors our history has ever known! The caloong on star doesn't change that. - Oh, really? I think everything has changed. I think we need a new Keeper of the Codes. I plan to go before the War Council tomorrow, at dawn, to submit my resignation and I expect they'll choose you as the new leader. - You can't be serious! - Why not? Your skills have been demonstrated, your heart seems set. - What are you trying to say? - I'm saying that you've taken my heart and run it through with your sword, and I can't put my mind at the battle because all I can think about is you. (mellow orchestral music) - I told you, Josh Kirby is my friend, and nothing more. - I heard your words. I also see the look in your eyes when you're with him. You have to make a choice between him and me, I think you've made it. (mellow orchestral music) - I can't think about those choices right now, and neither can you! There is only one person who can save our people from this terrible time right now, and he is standing right in front of me! (mellow orchestral music) Save us, Akira! Or I won't have a chance to decide upon a husband. (mellow orchestral music) (door whirring) (bomb exploding) (door whirring) - [Soldier] Stand by! (dramatic orchestral music) (soldiers chattering) - Well, it's refreshing to see that something's been left unravaged by those demon worms. (metal clanging) (groaning) (Prism chattering) - Look, I'm sorry if I caused any trouble, sir. - Trouble? (laughs) - What is the extent of the damage, Commander? - Our airborne fleet has been reduced to a dismal few, and our entire weapons deck has been eaten. I trust with your freedom you've managed to find a way to harness these pets before they take to devouring the very flesh from our bones. - Well yeah, as a matter of fact we have. - Oh, well tell me then, I'm all ears! (alarm beeping) - Incoming message from Dreadnaught's ship, Commander! - Bring it down. (maniacal laughing) - I like what you've done with the place, it suits you! (laughs) - I trust you aren't here for decorating insights, what is it you want? - Oh, you know what I want! The enslavement of your entire planet. (laughs) - Well, you're in a chipper mood today. - I'm always happy when I win. - Oh, but you haven't won yet. - Don't threaten me with verb tenses. Win, won, it's all inevitable. - If I were you I wouldn't be so quick to move in just yet, or you might find yourself at the wrong end of an angry laser beam! - And if I were you, which by the way I thank heaven that I'm not! (laughs) I would hold my threats, 'cause after all, I could just as easily kill you, as to make you my serving boy. - The day I succumb to serving you, is the day I die! - Well, than that would be ah, today! (laughs) - Blast you Dreadnaught! You have not defeated us, do you hear me? Not while there is breath in my body, and fire in my soul! - Spoken like a desperate man, if there ever was one. (laughs maniacally) (fist thudding) - [Azabeth] It's not over yet, you said so yourself! - I was bluffing. - But what of Josh Kirby's plan? - Oh that is true, we have not heard Josh Kirby's plan yet. So tell us, boy, what have you in that mind of yours, hmm? (laser guns firing) - Really? - Why not, things can't get any worse. - All right! First I need The Nullifier components. - Of course, we'll use your Nullifier weapon to destroy Dreadnaught's ship. Quotient, bring the possessions of the Earthling to the Command Center, at once! - Yes, sir. (door whirring) - Um, that's not exactly it. You see, The Nullifier is useless without all the pieces, and so far, we've only found three. But for what we need right now, three is enough. This is the cheese that's gonna lead the rats right to us. - Josh Kirby please, enough with your 20th century metaphors. - What? - The Nullifier's what the prehistoric worms are after. - Now of course, this bizarre occurrence leads itself to a hypothesis which is deeply rooted-- - Ah, Irwin! How long are we gonna keep circling this airport, huh? - Of course! Now, you see the worms are seeking the comfort of a blanket from their own period, which of course is impossible! Therefore, they find themselves gravitating toward something which, like themselves, has traveled through time. First of all, they fix themselves on my Time Pod, and then onto The Nullifier components. - Yeah, so we each take a piece of the component, and we try and draw the worms into a central location. - And we suggest the transportation hangar. - Not on your life! Those worms have already destroyed all but one of our air fleet, and I will not jeopardize our only means of escape on some human theory! What are your thoughts on the subject, or dare I ask? - Well, as a great commander once said, "Things can't get any worse." - Sir, the shear generators indicate that we have just under two hours of protection left. - Proceed. And let us pray to Kang that you're right! (mellow orchestral music) (moves into suspenseful orchestral music) - I must say, I was very proud of the way you handled yourself back there. - Well if you must, then you should. - You've become quite the Warrior, Josh Kirby. Decisive strategist, and sometimes almost good company. - Well, I haven't done anything yet. (mellow orchestral music) - More than you realize. (mellow orchestral music) - Let's make our way back towards the hangar, 'cause with this Nullifier component as bait, the worms are bound to follow us. - Good thinking. - Oh! (groans) (ethereal orchestral music) - This is ludicrous. Where are those blasted worms when I need them? (dramatic orchestral music) (soldiers chattering) (distant laser guns firing) (control console beeping) - I hope Josh Kirby knows what he's doing. - I doubt very much that he knows what he's doing, but he has a plan nonetheless. I have traveled down the very corridors of time with that boy, and he's yet to let me down. - But on the other hand, these worms of yours... (control panel beeping) - Will you stop calling them my worms? They are not my worms! I did not create them! Not one cubular segment of their slimy little bodies! They are not my worms! Do you understand? - It was just a figure of speech. (exhaling) (whimsical orchestral music) (worms chattering and cooing) (screaming) (dramatic orchestral music) - Which way? - Um... - Um? - That way! - Now, you're sure? - Kang says, "When in doubt, turn right." - That's a Code of Kang? - Number seven! - [Azabeth] Whoa! - [Josh] Hello! - [Azabeth] Worms! - [Josh] This way! (dramatic orchestral music) (worms cooing and chattering) Comin' your way, guys! They're right behind us, and they're movin' fast! - We're just about ready. - [Josh] We don't have time for just about, Irwin, these worms are on our tail! - Look, you worry about leading those pestilent things up in the right direction, let me worry about the spacecraft! - [Josh] Here we come! (dramatic orchestral music) - Josh Kirby the worms are increasing their pursuit of The Nullifier piece! - The colorful human metaphor would be, scram! (worms chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) Here they come! - Make way, here they come! It's your plan, it's your piece! - Are we set? - You bet! Now once you're inside, press the red button on the control console, this will start the launch procedure. But be quick, you've only got 45 seconds to get out of the ship and behind that hangar door before she blasts off! - 45 seconds, a piece of cake. - You realize if you fail, you're sending our last means of escape right into enemy hands. - Relax pal, I'm a Time Warrior. (clicks) (worms chattering) - [Irwin] Professor Quotient. (worms chattering) - All right, come on! Hey you, the ugly one in the front, let's go! Come on, here they are, come on! (worms chattering) (whimsical orchestral music) Come on. (worms chattering) (whimsical orchestral music) (door banging) (dramatic orchestral music) (worms chattering) (engines revving) - Come on, Josh. - Come on, Josh. (engines revving) - All right. All right, come on. That's good. Good, good, just like the ABC's, all right. (worms chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) Come on! (worms chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) All right. (worms chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hurry up, Josh Kirby! (worms cooing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh no! No! Azabeth, I'm stuck! (dramatic orchestral music) Help! - What's he yelling? - I'm stuck! - Something's wrong! - Come on, it's my foot, it's my foot, get my foot out! Pull, pull-pull! (straining) (dramatic orchestral music) - Run! - [Josh] Run! - They're coming! (dramatic orchestral music) (panting and gasping) (engines firing) Did you get them all? - I certainly hope so! (panting and gasping) - All right, let's go back to the Commander Center and figure us a trap! - Come on! (panting and gasping) I've rigged a radio-control device inside the carrier. So, when Dreadnaught hears your call, he'll think the transmission's actually coming from the carrier. (transformer exploding) - All right then. - Here goes everything! (transmitter beeping) - This is Akira Storm with a class-one distress call, Dreadnaught has left me no other recourse but to flee my home world. I repeat, this is a class-one distress call, I'm in need of immediate assistance! - [Dreadnaught] Don't worry Akira, I'll help you. - [Akira] Dreadnaught, no! - [Dreadnaught] Yes-s-s-s. (dramatic orchestral music) - He's taking the carrier into his tractor beam. (suspenseful orchestral music) - He's buyin' it! - It's working! - Closer. Closer! (transmitter beeping) That's it, the carrier's on board! (mellow orchestral music) - So, what happens now? (bomb exploding) (mellow orchestral music) - Well, we wait. (foreboding orchestral music) (distant laser guns firing) (mellow anticipatory orchestral music) Hey. What's with that? - What? - That! Nothing! I don't hear anything! - The attack has stopped! - (laughs) You did it, Josh Kirby you did it! (laughing) - Yes! (laughing) (Dreadnaught screaming) - You rebel dogs! I'll have you splayed for this! Do you hear me, Akira! (screams) - [Dreadnaught Soldier] They're everywhere! The worms have eaten all our gravity stabilizers! We're gonna have to-- - Silence, you fool! We must-stand-strong! (worms cooing and chattering) (screams) Get this thing off of me! (screams) - [Dreadnaught Soldier] Sir, we have no other option but to surrender, we must abandon ship immediately! - I'd rather die than abandon my ship! (hologram buzzing) I'd rather die than abandon my-- (ship exploding) - [Kang Soldier] It's gone! (dramatic orchestral music) (creature grunting and growling) (dramatic orchestral music) (space suit ringing) (dramatic orchestral music) (space suit ringing) (dramatic orchestral music) (space suit ringing) (dramatic orchestral music) - What are you lookin' at? (creature whimpering and growling) (cosmic whooshing) It will take far more than you, Josh Kirby, to stop me from my destiny! I am coming young Time Warrior, and I'm coming to put things right once and for all! (cosmic whooshing) (dramatic orchestral music) - Josh Kirby. Thank you for your help. - Well, it's the least I can do. After all, it looks like I'm gonna be living here for the rest of my life. - There's nothing Irwin can do? - Even for the first smartest guy in the 25th century, he still has his limits. He has no way of jump-starting us into the Time Stream. - Well, you saved my home planet so, you're a hero here as well. - Well, there still are some in this joint who treat us like the plague. - Akira. (door whirring) - Bingo! (door whirring) Lover boy! - Arranged marriages on my planet are a time-honored tradition, it has nothing to do with romantic affection or love as you know it. It's done out of necessity. - Oh, so you don't love this guy? - No, of course not. - Well, looks as if everything will be as it was in no time at all! - No, everything can't be as it was, Akira. - But I thought now that you're back here permanently you'd... Why do you look so glum now, hmm? This is a day of victory. - But Josh and Irwin are trapped, away from their home planet and I am empathetic towards their feelings. - As a Warrior of Kang you should well know that no victory is gained without some loss. Besides, you should be happy to be back with your own people, not off gallivanting in the company of humans. But according to the 12th Code of Kang, I must remain at Josh Kirby's side until my life-debt is repaid to him. - The 21 Codes were not meant for humans. - Has the path of Kang taught you nothing thus far? If the 21 Codes of Kang did not apply to all humans, then they do not apply to me! It is stated in the 21st and final Code of Kang, "No soul can live in freedom, "so long as another remains enslaved." Your attitudes and actions against the humans are, are no better than Dreadnaught's were against us. - Your time spent with the humans was bountiful indeed, Azabeth. I apologize, your wisdom and tolerance is even greater than your skill as a Warrior. I believe you all have much to teach us. - We all have much to teach each other. - What up? The 12 hours are up and it doesn't look like I'm gonna need my Time Warrior powers after all. (door exploding) (groaning and shouting) (Prism cooing and chattering) (dramatic orchestral music) - I still don't have your spleen, I've come for it now! (growling and yelling) (frenetic orchestral music) Lower your weapons, or I air out her brain the hard way! (suspenseful orchestral music) (Prism wailing) Do it! (suspenseful orchestral music) (weapons dropping) (Dreadnaught laughing) Oh, my dear! Your hologram does not do you justice! (suspenseful orchestral music) - (sniffs) Neither does yours. - Your grievance is with me. - Oh, my grievance is with you, huh? Well, you don't give the orders anymore. You know, all's I wanted was a few slaves. Why'd ya have to go and destroy my ship, my crew, my empire? - I did nothing but select a path, the choice I had to, to make me a better person. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Well that's why you're gonna have to pay... With her life! (shouting and screaming) (frenetic orchestral music) (screaming and growling) (frenetic orchestral music) (screaming) (cosmic whooshing) (baby cooing) - What happened? - Where's Dreadnaught? (baby chattering) (wondrous orchestral music) - Your new Time Warrior powers... It must work both ways! - You mean this... - You have just zapped Dreadnaught back into infancy. - Aw, get outta here! - You hold in your hands, a bouncing baby Enslaver. - Oh come on, I'm not ready for fatherhood, take him! - He looks so harmless! (baby cooing) - Almost is... - Cute. - Cute? Cute. It's a rat fink in diapers! - Not necessarily. What you see before you is a clean slate. A soul which is now erased of all life's pains and pleasures. There's a choice of two different paths, the ultimate choice. - A chance for goodness. - Yes. A chance for goodness. But we'll all have to wait to see where this chance leads. - Commander! I believe-- - No, not in that order, you nitwit! (dramatic orchestral music) (screaming) (cosmic whooshing) (thunder rolling) (dramatic orchestral music) - What's happened? Where are we? (Prism chattering) - Irwin, look The Nullifier components! - Great jumping meteors, it's a fifth component! - Yeah, but how? - No Josh, Josh wait a minute, that's no tinker toy! At the moment, these components are recharging, their energy at the moment is pure Zandarian dynamite! - Well what is it, electricity? - No, not electricity. But it's energy. The equivalent of enough jigawatts to power a thousand Time Pods, or to zap a young man such as yourself into molecular dust. - [Josh] Eek! - Well, how much time will they take to recharge? - Well let's see, C plus energy, plus time expanded, at the bump-a-dump-a-dump-a-dum, and carry the one-- - You have no idea, do you? - In a word, no. But I do know that if you had touched any of these, you would of become the equivalent of a human lightning rod. - Oh, so it's kinda like the key on Ben Franklin's kite? - Irwin, the question is, how in the Name of Kang did we get here? - Well even though these five components are separate at the moment, when the four of them were joined together, they were able to create enough power to transport themselves across time, and to get in touch with the first of the two remaining components. It also created enough power to drag us through the vortex of the energy. - Well, I can see why you're the second most brilliant man of the 25th century. - Oh no, now that I defeated Zoetrope, I'm the first. It's lonely at the top. (ground rumbling) (Prism chattering) - What is that? What is that? It's an earthquake! (suspenseful orchestral music) (screaming) (ground rumbling) (frenetic orchestral music) (screaming) - The Nullifier components, they're gone! - Azabeth? - Lopdrosters? These are a delicacy on my planet! (teeth crunching) - Ouch! - Holy... - Ooh, that didn't tickle, you know! - I'm sorry, I didn't know I... - Irwin. - Yeah. - Irwin um, what's happening? - They're fascinating. Fungi! - [Josh] Yeah, yeah they look like they could be fun guys. - No, no, no, no, not fun guys, fun-gi. I mean, parasitic bacterial organisms that thrive mainly on moisture and nitrogen. - Yeah, yeah they're mushrooms. I hate mushrooms, I hate 'em! Except on pizza. - Where I come from, they are much smaller, we call them lopdrosters and, and they don't have faces, and they don't speak! (cosmic tinkling) (whimsical orchestral music) (Prism chattering and cooing) - [Lopdroster] Oh beloved Furry One, all great and powerful! You have finally come to deliver us from The Muncher! (Prism cooing) - [All Lopdrosters] We pledge our undying loyalty, oh Furry One! - [Josh] Irwin? - [Irwin] Yeah? - Irwin, why are they praying to Prism? - Well, apparently they must think Prism is some form of deity! - Yeah right, a furry one! - Yes, well they're right! Well I mean, they're half right because on the planet Prism comes from for six lunar progressions of the year he does, indeed, grow a coat of fur! - Oh, cool! - No-no, not, not cool, you see the fur is-- - I get it Irwin, I get it! - [All Lopdrosters] Pledge our undying loyalty, oh Furry One. (Prism cooing) We pledge our undying loyalty, oh Furry One. - Be careful with Prism, Mushroom Fuey! He's one of a kind! - [All Lopdrosters] We pledge our undying loyalty, oh Furry One. We pledge our undying loyalty, oh Furry One. We pledge our undying loyalty, oh Furry One. (Prism chattering) - Thank you for delivering the Furry One, back to his rightful place! You have proven yourselves to be worthy servants. Hey, you can go now! - [Azabeth] I... - Azabeth! - Don't worry Josh, she's probably just a little bit woozy from the air down here, that's all. - I feel so weak. So tired, I... - Irwin, Irwin that mushroom she ate. (light tinkling music) - It could be that these fungi aren't meant for consumption by carbon-based life forms. - You mean she's poisoned! - That could very well be the case, yes. - It's not my fault, she took a bite out of me! (light tinkling music) This is too much! - She won't die, will she? I mean, she only took one bite. - Well, organisms have different tolerances relative to a dose of poison, the line between no effect at all and a lethal dose, can be very thin. - It's all right, (inhales) I'm better now. - Okay. - [Narrator] On the next chapter of Josh Kirby... Time Warrior! (cosmic whooshing) - Irwin, we've gotta find an antidote! - But where, how? - Our king will know what to do, come! (trumpet blaring) - I summon the Royal Doctor! (trumpets blaring) - Very bad, only one antidote. Must taste from one 'Shroom spores, Puffball. - [Josh] So, where do we find this Puffball guy? - Nightmare Hollow! (dramatic orchestral music) No one who goes there will ever return alive! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Well, I'm obviously in the right place, and the right time. (screaming) (lights buzzing) - Stingers! These things sting like bees back home, only worse! - Leave and make tracks! (stingers buzzing) On the other side of that bridge, is Nightmare Hollow. (mellow orchestral music) - [Azabeth] The nether regions. - [Lopdroster] The evil place. - [Irwin] The epitomal image of Dante's hellish inferno. - [Josh] Yeah, so in other words, we gotta watch our butts. - Josh Kirby run! (rope whirling) - Oh no! (suspenseful orchestral music) (bridge crashing) (lava bubbling) (suspenseful orchestral music) (guttural growling) (screaming) (suspenseful orchestral music) - Don't look in his eyes! (suspenseful orchestral music) - [Josh] We're looking for a 'Shroom called Puffball, and we need him right now! - [Creature] Well, I will take you to them. - [Irwin] She's slipping rather quickly, Josh. (whimsical orchestral music) - Where's Puffball, where is he? (whimsical orchestral music) (wind howling) - Josh! (suspenseful orchestral music) - Five minutes. - Great jumping ions! (suspenseful orchestral music) You're summoning up your own time storm! Josh, be careful! (whimsical orchestral music) (moves into mellow orchestral music) (moves into dramatic orchestral music) (moves into mellow orchestral music) (MultiCom Jingle)
