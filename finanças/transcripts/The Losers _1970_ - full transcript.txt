(Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) Haul it! Get the hell out of here! Move out! Get your asses outta that truck, for Christ's sake! Give me some back. Ah! You motherfuckers. Get that truck movin'! (Foreign language) Sergeant Winston, Major. Your, uh, men are here. Two hours late, Sergeant. Yes, Sir. We, uh, lost nine men about three miles up the road, Sir. Ten-hut! Okay, you guys, here comes Big Brother. Oh, I forgot to salute, Matt. Ten-hut! Well, I didn't know you were gonna show up looking like a bunch of freaks. Now, wait a minute, Matt. Look, you hired scooter trash for this job, that's what you got. What did you expect, a bunch of Campfire Girls? I guess not. How are you? Fine, what do you say, Matt? Matt, let me introduce you to these freaks. This here's Limpy. Hi, Man. This is Duke. Speed, and Dirty Denny. Fellas. This is Captain Jackson, my brother Link. Sergeant Winston. He's gonna be your bodyguard while you're here. Woo. All right, knock it off. Sergeant, secure the transportation. Yes, Sir. Come on, gotta show you something. Duke. Hey, Denny, you dig on that Captain Midnight, Man? He's so uptight, he squeaks. Objective's here, Dang Huc. It's a few miles into Cambodia. It's a small village, maybe some Chinese troops, maybe some VC. It's neutral, we can't go in there, but you can. And if anybody catches you, we never heard of you. But the CIA wants to get their man out of there. Now. Chet Davis is in one of these three huts. We don't know which one. There's two small trails leading into here. That's why you need the bikes. Speed's all you got going for you. Fast in, out faster. This could really be a bummer, Matt, huh? Yeah. Every VC for 100 miles is gonna be trying to stop you from bringing Chet Davis outta there. We'll get him. Say, Duke, you and Denny are both vets. You know what it's like out here. What made you take this assignment, money? The money? The bread, Man. I'm a full-blooded American boy, Captain. A good citizen and all that crap. That's what we're gonna find out, isn't it? I certainly hope so. It's a Yamaha, Man! This is a broad's bike. You ever tried to ride a chopper in the dirt, Limpy? Hey, Man, if I'm gonna be driving a broad's bike, I want the gold one. I saw it first, Beulah. No, Man. Tell you what, we'll flip for it. Heads I win, tails you lose. Call it. Heads. You lose, Baby. Get off that motor. Speed, don't mess with that bike, that's mine. Hey, Homes, you coming all the way to Loc Sai with us, Man? All the way, night and day. Ah, Christ. All right, all you big, bad motorcycle bums, start checking these out, 'cause they ain't Harleys. And I would sure hate to see any of you big bad asses get dumped on a broad's bike, huh? Sure, Man. I'm afraid we'll never make soldiers out of them, Major. Don't have to. Captain? Cover is here, Sir. Be right there, Sergeant. Yes, Sir. All right, Men, what it is. That's my truck there. Stay close behind me all the way. We don't expect any trouble, but if we run into it, take cover, and let us do the fighting. Do I make myself clear? We wouldn't have it any other way, Captain. Now, about the bikes. They've gotta be weapons on wheels. Jackson will give you everything you need. Okay, Matt. Now, I know how you feel about Chet Davis, but just bring him back alive. Hang in, Matt. Ya-ha! Hey, you silly clown, I said stay behind! Get back where you belong! Damn hardheads, I knew this would happen. Just as soon as we get to Loc Sai, their ass is grass. Hey, you guys, these kids think I'm Tarzan! Hey, you Jane? You don't look like Jane. You look like Cheetah. Here, Cheetah, you better have a Gook Taco. Hey, Tarzan, Cheetah won't eat! Let's move out, move out! Let's go! Hey, Pal. Hey, Pal. Come on. Hey! Shit! Look at this, Man! Come on. Go around 'em, let's go. Get it on! Hey, come on, get movin'! Now, now! Look, you and the squad go eat. I'll catch up with you later. Yes, Sir. (Foreign language) Ah, good morning, Capitan. Morning. First drink on the house, okay? No, thanks. No? Maybe you want a girl, huh? No, I want a guy. A guy, okay. Uh, you don't understand. I'm looking for the guy that owns that motorcycle out there on the street, an American. The kids are stripping his bike down. Just thought he might like to know. Look, Captain, you want a drink, I give you. Maybe you want a girl, huh? No, thanks. Maybe smoke, huh? Would you mind if I just kinda look around? Okay, suit yourself. You must keep it hot. Take the smoke deep inside you. Hey, Joe. Hashish, Opium? What you got to trade? What you give, huh? I'd give you a couple of broken arms if I didn't have more important things to do. Denny? Link? Link? Speed! Very cheap, Joe. I'll give you good price. How about Cocaine? Cannabis, Heroin? (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) Love ya, love ya. Come here, Baby. I gotta get a drink. Hello, Nursie! Well, now, Dirty Denny. Welcome to my place. Your place? I used to own a piece of the action at this joint until I got busted out of the army. The others here with ya? Man, who cares? I know nothing. You were supposed to follow close behind. Yeah, Man, you see, but, uh, I, uh, zipped out of town so fast when I got busted out of the army that I didn't get a chance to collect any of the bread that was owed me. I decided to zip on back in town and collect what was due me. Down the street, there's an old, beat-up garage. That's where we'll be fixing up the bikes. Man, I don't need no stinking bikes right now. You gotta be putting me on. That's good, Denny, 'cause you don't got one. Huh? When I came in here, the kids had the wheels off of it. I'll kill 'em! I'll kill them slope heads! Get out of the way! Watch out, you old bitch! Get out of there, you thieving slope heads, before I kill ya! Ah, they're takin' my stuff. (Foreign language) Get away from me. Lady, get away! Oh, you want to play, huh? Steal my bike? Steal my bikes? Get off of me! (Foreign language) (Foreign language) Look, if you ever come around here again, I'll kill you. Had you figured all wrong, Captain. You're not a bad spook after all. From now on, when I say, follow behind, that's what I want you to do. Okay, Captain, Sir. Coffee? I got good price for coffee. What's the deal? One pound American coffee, one bottle beer. Listen, you little weasel, we give you one pound of American coffee, you give us a six-pack of beer, and you throw in the spark plugs just 'cause you love us. Sounds like number-one deal. I'll take it. Hello, Charlie. my favorite thieving slope head. You trying to cheat my friends? Please excuse, Gentlemen. What the hell happened to you, Man? Ran into a water buffalo, and the super spook bailed me out. Where's Duke? Oh, he's sitting on the john, Man, singing the stars and stripes. Look, I don't suppose it'll do any good to talk to you men about disobeying orders, but the last thing I told you was to stay close behind. Could have gotten your fool heads blown off. We didn't, did we, Man? Look, Major Thomas has done a good job setting this thing up. I want you to see the rest. You guys hang loose. Me Diem-Nuc, number-one mechanic, number-one garage. He's supposed to be on our side. I don't care whose side he's on. I wanna know if he knows what he's doing. Whaddya you say, Nucky? Look, Man, we're gonna put together some motorcycles here. We're gonna need some parts, spark plugs, one quarter inch steel plate, some two-inch steel strapping. Hey, Man, are you with me? With? I mean, like, can you dig it? Dig? Do you understand what the hell I'm talking about? Yes, I can dig. Did you ever work on two-cycle engines? Yes. What kind? Cadillac. Come here, Diem-Nuc. Yes? Where did you get all this equipment? From my friend. Who? He good man, the Albanian. Albanian? You keep him away from here. I don't want anyone around. Do you understand? Well, I mean, with this crazy mechanic and this knocked-out garage, Man, Limpy ought to be able to come up with something in here. Anything you don't have here, we'll get. Time is very important in this operation, Lincoln. I hope we won't have to wait too long to get these bikes fixed up. If you're waiting on the bikes, Man, you're backin' up. Chet Davis is waiting. I'm glad I'm not in his boots. Let me tell you something about Chet Davis and his boots. He uses those boots for stomping on people like you and me. But I guess you wouldn't know much about that, would you, Captain? I mean, those bars beat you out a lot, don't they? That's right. They make you colorless. You really believe that, Man? Yeah, man, I believe it. (Foreign language) No, it's me, Duke. Duke! Oh! (Foreign language) Suriya, where? Right there. Suriya! It's me, Duke! Suriya! Oh, Duke. It's been so long. So long.

And your kid brother? He not kid now. He fight now, fight Viet Cong. I wish, Duke, I cannot go before I see him, My Brother. We wait two, three days. You come back? All right, I'll wait a couple more days. As long as I know where you are. I didn't even know if you were still alive. Let's get some sleep now. Good night. Tac Houn. (Foreign language) Okay. I'll see you in a couple of days. I'm gonna have to get you a new dress. I can't take you home with me looking like that. How long is this trip gonna last? Four or five days. Does it matter? No, it doesn't matter now. All right, Denny, this is a Swedish nine-millimeter machine gun. Clip release, clip holds 40 rounds. Shove it in, pull back the receiver hammer, and pull the trigger. That's all there is to it, got it? Yeah, I got it. We're gonna mount the machine gun up here. Here, over the seat, we got saddlebags filled with grenades, made so when we jerk them out, the pin comes out. We pitch them over our shoulder. I can see right now no one's gonna be safe within a mile of you. That's the general idea, Captain. If I'm wanted, I'll be in ordinance. Yes, Sir. Ah, screw this. I need a drink. Come on, Limpy. Yeah, Man. Hey, Buffalo! What? Let's get some beer, Man. Hey, you coming? No, Man, I'm gonna hang in here, all right? All right. Man, those guys are sure not gonna bust their ass working, are they? There's lot more important things than working. Now, what the hell is driving you? Chet Davis. Do you really believe that this broad would steal money from me after everything I've done for her? Yeah, I'd believe it. And if you ever steal from me again, you slant-eyed witch, I'll really bust your head in. Where do you think you're going?

Well, now that we got that out of the way, what's your name? Kim Sue. I'm Limpy. You know what that means? Limp, limp, limp, limp. That's what it means. Christ, you got a kid in here? Oh, my baby. Well, where else would she be but with me? Christ. You got a kid in here. It's a nigger baby. One of the black men, a soldier? A black man. An officer. He was a good man, a good soldier. Only he don't need me no more. So here I am. So you've been left out in the cold, Baby? Well, me too, sort of. Hey, Baby, you don't do anything nasty like smoking dope, do you? Come on, give me a little lip-lock. Let's hit it. Come on, come on, come on. What the hell was that? All right, let's go! Police. Cops? Great joy. My God, here comes a host of Mounties! He stole my money, he did! What is this? Do something! (Foreign language) Okay, I'll take that loot, GI. I'm no GI, Pig. I said give me that money, Freak. He's a short little spider, ain't he? Back up, you bastard! Whoop him, Den, get it on him! You want it? Come and get it! I'll blow your brains out! Nobody's gonna get my bread. Hold it! Hold it! Limpy! Oh no! What the hell you looking at? Get us outta here. Shut up! Now, I just had a long talk with the inspector here. You've got seven years, and believe me, they'll make these charges stick, assaulting a police officer, battery, theft, malicious mischief. You name it, and you got it. All right, you little. Animal! You damn Vietnamese pig. Denny, you really know how to make friends. Pig's a pig, Man. So what do I gotta do to get outta this jail? What kind of deal do I gotta make? I'll tell you what the deal is. The Captain bails you out, and you agree to his terms. So, what terms? I want your word you'll do your damn job you're supposed to do, and that's all. You got it. Sergeant Link, of the American Lincoln Sausage Company, I have for you one case of American beer and one pencil-neck geek. Good afternoon. 100 six-packs of American beer, one box of spark plugs. Number-one deal. Tell your men to take the rest of that beer and put it over in the shed. And you get outta here, you little weasel. Thank you very much. Righteous, Man, righteous. My knobbies are here. Let's get these suckers on. Uh-uh. I'm gonna go to Mama-San's and get myself a chick. Denny, Denny, I mean, you've gotta be the dumbest cat I ever met in my life, Man. Denny, Mama-San's the one that turned you in. Yeah, I know, but I figure, uh, I can let her know who the boss is. Don't go to Mama-San's. Take it easy, Denny. Hey. Thanks, Man. Hurts. Outta sight, Man, outta sight. Here's a little something for your head. Everything loaded, what about the ammo? Yes, Sir, it's all loaded. I guess we're ready. Any problems? Yeah, you. Where's Duke? Duke! You got any problems? All right. Just one thing before we go. Good luck. Wow. Get 'em out. Let's get it on. Hey, Soldier, take these and put 'em with the bike, huh? No wonder we're losing the lousy war. Well, what the hell is that? Ask him. What the hell is that? She's coming with me. Limpy, are you out of your goddamn mind? Link. Oh, come on, Man! Link. All right, Diem-Nuc, here's a little something from your Uncle Sam. And remember, if anyone asks you anything about us, you don't know anything. You understand? Yes, Sir. Captain? Captain? You greatest of friends. Sergeant. Look at that, Man, huh? Where the hell you going? Don't worry, Man, I'll catch up! I'll be there as soon as you are! Get back here, you stupid bastard! Come on, move! All that over there. Put some of that on the perimeter. Where's Duke? He dropped off a ways back there. Who gave him permission? I did. Damn. Look, Captain, he's gonna be here in a little while. If one man drops out, it puts the whole operation in jeopardy. Can't you understand that? Yeah, I know that, Captain, just about as well as you do. What the hell you doing with that broad with you here? Not a broad, Captain. It's my girl. Now, we got a camp here, and they can stay here, and then we'll pick them up when it's all over. Don't sweat it. Besides, a couple of female types around here ain't gonna hurt at all. Hi, Matt. Link. How'd it go? What's that? The bikes. Come on over here, I wanna show you something. Hello, Kim Sue. Hello. Is that your man now? Well, is it? You'd better go on with him. Well, what do you think, Matt? You did one hell of a job. Thanks, Matt. What the hell is that? What do you mean, "What the hell is that?" Christ, anybody can see it's a hog wagon. That's a genuine Gook flattener. Man, you just roll over 'em, flatten 'em out, dry 'em, and sail 'em off. No, you see, what it really is, it's, um, it's half Harley and half Volkswagen. Damnedest thing I've ever seen. All right, Little Brother, you go on home. He'll be okay out there. Let's you and I go take a bath. It's like the old days, Duke. What is it, Duke? Just a question of loyalty. And if so, who to? It all comes down to that, Link or you. It's that simple, isn't it? I don't understand. Just love me. Baby okay? Yeah. You know, this is just like, like being married. You come home to your little woman, you turn on the television and drink some beer. How's my little woman? All right. 70 yards past the second building here, I turn left, then straight through. You just went through the side of a warehouse. Okay. Guess you'll turn right here. Through here, here. That's the southeast end of the dump, right here. You're sure? Sure, Man. Good. All right, now, which hut is Davis in? One of these three, here, here, and right here. All right, open your eyes. Hey, I did it, Man. I'm a good man. All right, Limpy. Link and Duke are gonna hit there. Where are you at that moment? Edge of the village, right here, rockets ready for anything that comes into sight. Speed? Yeah, Man, I lay over there at the gasoline dump and drop in a couple grenades. Denny? Denny! You sure drive hard, don't you? I know where I'm supposed to be. Are you sure, Duke? Are you sure? I'm sure, Baby. Oh, Duke, I'm frightened. Frightened? Oh. With me around, you don't have to be scared anymore. Okay, let's make it. I'll be a son of a bitch. Don't worry about it. He'll be there. All right? Now, what the hell would he want to do a stupid thing like that for? I guess he just wanted to live a little. All right, you guys, let's get on our bikes and go to work. Okay, it's all set up. At 0500 hours, you'll roll the bikes into position, and a mock battle starts. There'll be a battery of tanks out there to give you cover fire. That's about it. Oh, yeah, um, Captain Jackson and Sergeant Winston will be with you all the way to the border. Any questions? Okay, that's it. Get some sleep. See you in the morning. I thought we might need these. Speed? Hey, thanks, Baby. Denny. Limpy. Link. That's groovy, Man. What time is it, Speed? O455. Lieutenant Hayworth, move your unit into position. Well, we've been through this thing enough to know it, I guess, huh? Might as well get it done. Limpy, the one thing you've got to remember, Man, when you go in there with that hog wagon, you've gotta raise hell. We're gonna hit those bastards, they're gonna know it's me, Link. Commence firing. (Foreign language) (Foreign language) I'll hit the trench, you cover me. You got it! (Foreign language) You slant-eyed son of a bitch! Link! On the roof! He's got me pinned down, Link! I can't get to my bike! You son of a bitch. Okay, baby, I'm with ya! Oh, no, you don't! Those sons of bitches! God damn it, I'll fix 'em. (Foreign language) Oh, my God. Get back! Ha-ha! (Foreign language) Jesus Christ, Denny. (Foreign language) Ah, come on you mother! (Foreign language) Yah! Davis! Where the hell are you goin'? You let me go. Get him off of me! You stupid bastard. (Foreign language) (Foreign language) (Foreign language) Let me out of here, I don't know these people! I don't know these. Okay, Man. Maintain, Man. Maintain, Man! Link Thomas, you son of a bitch! You're still an animal. I shoulda locked you up for life. Five years just wasn't good enough for you, was it? I don't know, Man. Christ, no, five years ain't enough punishment, is it? For riding your goddamn motorcycle and trying to breathe a little air. And because if you've got an earring and long hair, the air you choose to breathe is, I mean, it belongs to the goddamn citizens, don't it, Man? Oh, yeah. And how about raping those young girls? How about that, huh? Or did you forget about that? Let me tell you something, Man. It don't start out like that. But you bastards, you bastards can never, never dig anything that don't fit into your mold. And you, by God, never try to understand nothing! I mean, if somebody's different, Man, what do you do, you squash 'em? Or you turn your back on 'em like, you'd kill 'em, don't you? What are you doing your number with him for, Link? They're going to kill us all anyway, aren't they? That's right. They're going to kill you. They're going to kill all of you. And you want to know something? It's not going to make any difference. Nobody's gonna care. It's not gonna mean a damn thing, because every newspaper throughout the whole world is gonna read something like this, Three doped-up, freaked-out American motorcycle tramps tried to take on the entire Chinese army. And don't you think that's a little bit ridiculous? Yeah, everybody thinks that's ridiculous, you see, because that ain't the way it is. I mean, we're not trying to take on the Red Chinese army. And you're probably the only one around here that's so goddamned dumb that you don't know that the Chinese are gonna do you. You see how it is, Man? We come in here to bail you out. And we didn't start out as three men. We started out as five. And there are two bikers lying dead out there because of you, and you wouldn't make a pimple on either one of them's ass. How dare you? You no-good trash. I've had broads hit me harder than that, Man. You know something? I don't care how hard broads have hit you. You know something else? I don't care what you think of me. I just want you to know that I represent the United States of America. You really are stupid, you know that? You think I came in here by accident? Think I just stumbled in here? I came in here for a specific reason, to get the Red Chinese out of Cambodia, and I almost made it. And then you, with all your funny-looking people, came in here and blew it for me. Now, is there some other way that you'd like to deprecate the United States of America and its representative? Or, uh, maybe you'd like to hit me again. Sergeant. Cigarette? Thank you, Sir. Very quiet, Major. I don't think they're gonna make it, Sergeant. Why don't we go in and bail 'em out, Sir? Can't do that. Could if we threw away the book. When are we gonna bust out of here, Link? This ain't nothing but a Cracker Jack box. Them ain't exactly animal crackers out there, Limp. They got guns. Good evening, Gentlemen. What a bummer. A real bummer. I'm sorry, Mr. Davis, you are not as comfortable as we tried to make you before. It won't be for long. Try and make the best of it. May I have some water, please? Of course, and something to smoke, some cigarettes? Thank you. And you will prefer something a little stronger, I think. It might make things easier for you. Why don't you try and get some sleep? We have a long journey to start on tomorrow. Where to? Have you ever been to China before, Mr. Davis? Come here. Let's get outta here. (Foreign language) Oh, mother! It's Vietnam! (Foreign language) The next time I come to wrestle here, I'm gonna tear apart all those I get, Link! (Foreign language) Once more with feeling! I love ya baby, do you love me? Are you naked? Meet my friend, motherfucker! I'm with ya. Yeah, that the old done in America. All right, Link, get it off. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah, right. Davis, you be a good boy. Speed, all set? Righteous. Let's get it on, Limpy. (Foreign language) Get to your squad, get it on! No, stop, oh my god! Hang on, Limpy. Lieutenant Hayworth, lay in a cover barrage. Don't touch me, Link. Get down, Link, get down! Get out, Link. Get down. Davis, god damn it! Come and help! I wouldn't help you, you son of a bitch. I hope they kill you. Davis, if I get outta this, I swear to god, I'm gonna kill you. They can't make it, I'm goin' in for 'em. No, Captain! All right, cover him! Hear me, cease fire! Come back here, you bastard! Davis! Davis! I'm gonna cut your guts out! Shoot him! Well, Major. You finally did somethin' right. I'll give you that one.
