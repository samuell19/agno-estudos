(heavy breathing) Carlos: You scared now, little fag? Where is it? (hitting sound) Kyle: I didn't take it. Carlos: I'm not playing no more. Where is my fucking Rolex? Oh no, no you don't. No you don't. No you don't. No, no. That motherfucking Rolex is real. My old lady bought it for me and I want it back. If you think it's worth your life, we can keep playing this game. (loading gun) Then again, what have you got to live for, really? Kyle: I didn't take it. I didn't take - (gunshot) (music plays) Carolyn: Bonnie, would you like one? Julian: Come here. Hi baby. You having a happy birthday? I'd be happier if you'd marry me. Seriously? And this is what I'm marrying into. Carolyn: You are officially part of our family, Julian. Kyle: You bitch! Don't you dare. Carolyn: You might as well know the ugly truth. Kyle: No, no, Mom. Not you. Carolyn. Julian: Oh my God. Look at him in his little swimsuit. Kyle: No, Mom! I'll tell him myself. Yeah. Okay. I love you, too. Carolyn: When are you going to tell him? Kyle: It doesn't really matter. He's going to hate the idea. Carolyn: He could surprise you. Kyle: He won't. George: Oh my God. Carolyn: God, you should have seen Dad's face when Kyle first showed up in that. Julian: Your mascot was a bunny? Kyle: I was a jack rabbit. Jack rabbits are fierce. I was fierce. Pete: Mascot is a very important job. Kyle: Oh, that's nice, make fun of the birthday boy. Yeah, you should wear that tomorrow night. That's hot. Kyle: The fundraiser. Oh, George, how formal is it going to be? Maybe I should go shopping. Julian: You have a million things to wear. You're not going shopping. Kyle: Every party has a pooper. Julian: That would be me? Kyle: Mmhmm (affirmative). Julian: All right. Kyle: Pooper. (laughter) (dance music plays) Kyle: I know her. Julian: Yeah, that's Lindsey. Kyle: Yeah from Julian: Yeah, yeah. Announcer: Welcome to our Tweakers Project fundraiser. We're raising money for meth educa - You know why we're here. Come on, let's get the party started. (crowd cheering and clapping) (camera shutter) Kyle: Phew! It's getting past my bedtime. Julian: Hey. Can we get two vodka Red Bulls? Kyle: You having fun? Julian: Yeah, you? (camera shutters) Dusty: Adorable. Hey. How's it going? Can I get your name? I just need your name for the Tweaker Project website. Julian: Yeah. Sure. I'm Julian Adano. Dusty: Julian Adano. Julian: And this is, um, (laughing) This is Kyle Peeples. Dusty: Kyle Peeples. You look a little wiped out. Definitely hot, but a little tired. Julian: Yeah. You should have stopped at hot. Kyle: My God are you flirting? Julian: Yeah, I'm flirting a little bit. Dusty: I can help you out with the tired part. A little pick-me-up? Julian: For old time's sake? Kyle: It has been a while. Julian: Okay. Dusty: Come on. Julian: Come on. Kyle: How much? Dusty: Don't worry about it, man. It's my treat. Julian: It's kind of chunky. Oh! Shit, shit! It burns. That's not coke, right? Dusty: It's the same thing, practically, except better. Pumped with crystal, party lasts all night. Come on, man. You're not going to let him do it by himself, are you? Go for it. Kyle: Ow. Wow, that does burn. Baby. Julian: Okay? Kyle: Yeah. Dusty: It's going to feel great soon. Kyle: Okay. Dusty: Come on. Julian: Phew! Shake it off. Kyle: So much for meth-free. (laughing) (rock music plays) Julian: Babe, I'm home. Sorry it took so long. Kyle: Hey babe. I'll be right out. Julian: Oh, but we got Save Me in our queue. It's supposed to be good. Ted Allen is so cute. Kyle: One sec. (door opens) Dusty: Hey- Julian: Hey? You don't knock? Dusty: The door was open. Hey man. Kyle: Yo dude. Dusty: You all right? Kyle: Yeah, totally. Jules, so, Dusty got us on the list of that new club on Robertson. Julian: I thought you were staying in tonight. I was going to make one of our decadent Sunday dinners and maybe watch a movie. Dusty: Fuck that, man. You should come with. It's going to be really fun. I'm starting to think you don't like me. Julian: Yeah. Go with your instinct. Kyle: Come. We can do nothing tomorrow night. You should come with us. You haven't been out with us for weeks. Julian: You haven't stayed home in weeks. I'm asking you to stay home with me tonight. Please? Kyle: Baby, tomorrow night. Okay? Just you and me. I'll make it up to you. Promise. I love you. Dusty: Bye. Hey. What's your name? (rock music plays) Dusty: Hey! Watch the fucking camera. Bouncer: Don't ever let me catch you tweakers selling that shit in my club again. Trash. Dusty: That's the third club we got thrown out of. I'm running out of places to sell. Let's go to the bathhouse, find buyers there. Kyle: I don't know, man. Julian's going to be so pissed off at me. Dusty: What is he, your dad, dude? Come on. Party's waiting. (alarm beeping) (phone ringing) Julian: Hey, Carolyn. Is Kyle there? Okay. Bye. Yeah, no. I'm fine. Bye. (door closes) Julian: Oh, so you still live here. Kyle: You're supposed to be at work. Julian: Yeah, so are you. I can't live like this Kyle. I really can't. You were gone for three days. Kyle: I called. Julian: When you knew I'd be gone. Jesus, I thought you were dead. Julian: Fuck, Julian, I don't need you babysitting me. It's my life. I was having fun. Julian: Yeah. You know what? You're right. You're absolutely right. It is your life and you should do exactly what you want to do. So should I. Goddammit, living with you these last few weeks, you either stop with the crystal or it's over. Kyle: Over? Baby, come on. When you marry me, it's supposed to be for better or for worse. Julian: You know what? Maybe it's better that the worse happened when it did. Kyle: What are you doing? Julian: I'm packing your shit, because I can't live like this anymore, Kyle. I really can't. Kyle: Where am I supposed to go? Julian: Go call your fuck buddy, why don't you? Kyle: We're not fucking. He's not even gay! Julian: Okay, because that matters when you're tweaking. Kyle: Look, stop. Just stop, okay? Point taken. I love you. I love you. I'm sorry. You're right. I'll try to do better. I will, okay? Julian: You can't try. You have to quit. Kyle: Okay. Fuck. I know. I'll quit. I will quit. (music plays) Carolyn: Hello. Julian: Hey. Pete: Hey, sicko! Julian: Hey. Just in time. I need your help with the drinks. Carolyn: Want to come talk to me? I told him you had the flu. Kyle: Yeah, it really knocked me for a loop. Carolyn: Kyle. Julian told me what's been going on. What were you thinking? Kyle: Don't make a big deal, Carolyn. I was just blowing off a little stress with some fun, it got out of control. It's handled. Carolyn: Maybe you have too much on your plate. Kyle: Why would you think that? Did Pete say something about my work or something? Carolyn: No. I just thought It isn't weakness to ask for help, you know. You've got a big job. Kyle: I have it handled, okay? Carolyn: Do I need to be worried? Kyle: No. Just drop it, okay, Lynnie? Pete: Now, wait a minute. Julian says that he's not joining us in Iowa next week. Now, if he's not going, why am I stuck with your dad? Carolyn: For better or worse, you married into this family. You have to be there when we do family things. When Kyle and Julian tie the knot, Julian will have to come home and be miserable, too. Kyle: Yeah. Pete: Thank you. Carolyn: Oh, none for me. Thanks. Kyle: Really. Interesting. Julian: You know what. Why don't you lay off today, after that nasty cold. Pete: Oh, Kyle, while you were out, Frank Guerrmo put in his two week notice, so I can't promise anything, but if you want to apply. Kyle: Really? I'd so love to apply. That's awesome. Pete: Put together a presentation, I'll set it up over at the design center. Kyle: Okay. That's great. Thank you. (music plays) You like it? Julian: It's beautiful. Kyle: It's inspired by you. Julian: Yeah? Kyle: Makes me want to sit on it. Julian: (laughs) Yeah. Promises, promises. Kyle: If I could get this job, Jules, you know, if I could go home with a design job, he'd have to admit I could be a success, that my minor in design wasn't just fluff. Julian: No matter what happens tomorrow, you're a success to me. Hey! Knock them dead! (car starts) (music plays) Pete: It was clear that you put in a lot of hard work on this, Kyle. Unfortunately, it's not going to work out this time. You just don't have enough experience, yet. Just keep working, though. You had some good ideas. Julian: I heard. Carolyn called. Kyle: He didn't even look at my portfolio. He obviously just took to me because Pete asked him to. Julian: I'm proud of you, though. Kyle: My designs were good, though, weren't they? Julian: Yes. They were very good. Kyle: How am I going to tell Dad? (airplane sound) Radio: It's mid September in Sioux City and there's already a chill in the air as the election race heats up between incumbent Mayor Peeples and con - Kyle: Still confident of a win, Dad? Mr. Peeples: Too early to tell. I don't want to take anything for granted. Take a load off. I'll put these in your room. Hi dear. Carolyn: Looks like I won. Pete and I had a bet whether you'd actually show. Kyle: So, Pete bet against me, did he? Carolyn: No. He thought it was 50/50. Mom called. She invited us for breakfast tomorrow, if you want. Mr. Peeples: He just got here, Carolyn. Let him relax. Highland single malt, you'll like this. Pete: That was a fast turnaround at the airport. I guess the plane was on time? Mr. Peeples: Grab a glass, Pete. Pete: Hey. I was just admiring your impressive collection of scout badges. Mr. Peeples: Yeah. I found a whole bunch of them when I was renovating the office. Pete: Yeah, he framed them. All 50 of them. Mr. Peeples: Well, it was an accomplishment. Pete: I can understand the bird study and the cooking, but auto mechanics and home repair? Kyle: What can I say? I'm handy with power tools. Mr. Peeples: He was a good camper, not to mention a hell of a shot. Kyle: Luckily, they never made me actually kill anything. Mr. Peeples: Oh, you're a good hunter. He's just being modest. Kyle: No, Dad, I'm not. I don't like killing things. I told you a thousand times. Mr. Peeples: Well, you've got a whole slew of those duck decoys we carved together. What were they for then? Kyle: Objet d'art. Mr. Peeples: Huh? Kyle: They're decorative, Dad. Mr. Peeples: I know what objet d'art means, smart ass. I just didn't get your point. You can dismiss your badge record, but you earned them all, as much as you might like to think you're above it, since you're a hotshot LA furniture designer now. Carolyn: Dinner's ready, if you want to come sit down. Kyle, will you help me in the kitchen? So, what's the strategy? Do you want me to bring the engagement up? Would that be easier? Kyle: I don't know if now is such a good time. I'll just send him a copy of the announcement when it's over. How's that? Carolyn: Kyle. He doesn't even know you guys are living together. Julian deserves better than that. Don't make me out you. Kyle: It's my business, pushy. Wine? Carolyn: Not right now. Kyle: Wait a minute. Are you pregnant again? Carolyn: No. Kyle, Kyle, shh. No, no. Please. Kyle: Oh my God, you are. Carolyn: No, no, no. Listen. We're not saying anything. Kyle: (laughing) Carolyn: No, no, no. Kyle, come on. Kyle: Dad. Hot news flash. Carolyn: Kyle's getting married. Mr. Peeples: Now that's funny. Tell me you're kidding. No offense, but what's the point? Marriage is for making family. It's something you need a man and a woman for. Isn't that right, Pete? When are you going to make some grandbabies, anyway? Pete: Jack, I think you're oversimplifying. Kyle: Maybe it's so we can legitimize our relationship like everybody else is. Mr. Peeples: Well, that's idiotic. What difference does it make? Kyle: It makes a lot of difference. Mr. Peeples: If you're serious, I would appreciate it, you not announcing it all around town. It is difficult enough dealing with a son who likes to Just respect that this is my home and my community. Kyle: Don't worry, Dad. I wouldn't want to cost you votes in your election. Mr. Peeples: Where you going? Carolyn: Dad! Pete: Leave him be. Carolyn, he's a big boy. Carolyn: Kyle, please come back to eat. Come on. You know he didn't mean any harm. At least he accepts you're gay. Carolyn: Accepts it? He hasn't accepted it. He tolerates it. You know what the definition of "tolerate" is? It's to put up with, to endure. My father endures me. Carolyn: No. He loves you in his own way. Kyle: What does that mean? He loves me when I'm Mr. Badgemaster, when I can cock a gun, but not when I'm school fucking bunny rabbit. Carolyn: Kyle, please, he'll hear you. Kyle: Oh well, fuck it. Mr. Peeples: What is going on? Why is he so sensitive all of a sudden? Kyle: Wait 'til he finds out Julian's Latino. I wonder what he'll hate more, the gay thing or the interracial thing. Carolyn: Give him a chance to know Julian. He can't help but like him. Kyle: You have no clue, Miss Sunshine. Everything you do is perfect. Everything I do is shit. Me being gay is just icing on the cake in his disappointment. Don't wait up. I'm off to get nailed. (rock music plays) Pay UP- Sissy: Hi. Missy: Hi. Kyle: Hey. Sissy: Mid State High, remember? Missy: We were freshman when you were a senior. Sissy: The Baker sisters. Kyle: Oh my God. The Party Peanuts. Sissy. Missy: Missy. Sissy: Sissy. Kyle: Sissy. Hey, how are you? Missy: Right as rain. Sissy: How about you? Missy: We heard you moved to LA. Kyle: Yeah. I'm doing interior design out there. Missy: Wow. Sissy: Neat. Kyle: It's good. It's just me and a couple employees, but it's good. I can't wait to get out of this backassward town. I'm bored stiff. Sissy: We might be able to help with the bored part. Missy: And the stiff part, too, if you're lucky. Kyle: Some things never change. What do you got? Sissy: Come with us. Kyle: Okay. (knock on door) Kyle: Pete. Pete: You have a minute? Kyle: I was just about to come get you. I've been working on the spreadsheet. Pete: Yeah. Look, about that. You have something on your I'm going to have Jim do a pass on the spreadsheet. Kyle: What? Fuck, Pete. I've been working my ass off on that. I know you've been working really hard, Kyle, and all the long hours, I do, and I appreciate it, -- but... Kyle: But what? Pete: You know what? Why don't you just knock off early today? You just take a nice long weekend and then we'll reopen this next week. Kyle: Whatever. (door opens and closes) Kyle: Babe. Kyle: Hey. Julian: Looks like I'm a lucky boy. What's the occasion? Kyle: Just because. Julian: It's a little early for Halloween decorations, isn't it? Kyle: Do you like them? I was feeling festive. Julian: Yeah, I can see that. Kyle: Pete gave me the night off early, just sort of because, as a bonus. It's been so long since we've had any time to relax at all. I'm working nights so much. (phone ringing) Julian: Hello. No we were just sitting down to dinner. What's up? Kyle: I made your favorite. Shepherd's pie. Julian: Are you sure? All right. Thank you. Kyle: Pete is full of shit and he's fed Carolyn a pack of shit and she's of course going to back him up. She's turned into a fucking bitch. Julian: Okay, so where did the crystal come from? Kyle: Are you taking their side now? Julian: I'm trying to give you the benefit of a doubt, but it's hard to ignore the signs. Kyle: What fucking signs? What signs? I'm sick of everybody butting into my business. They wonder why I'm having problems at work when everybody keeps dogging me. Julian: What are you talking about. Kyle: I'm never going to get that promotion, because they'd rather have a good accountant and they just keep me down to avoid having to reward me. Julian: You're ridiculous. Kyle: I can see it. I can see it. Julian: Yeah. Kyle: I can see it. Julian: Me too. Kyle: They think I'm stupid, but I can see it. Julian: Okay. We're all stupid. You're the smart one. Kyle: It's just fucking bullshit. (dog barking) (knocking) Mia: Turn that shit off. Hi. Kyle: I'm looking for Dusty. Dusty: Dude. You made it. Mia, this is the Kyle, the dude I told you about. Kyle: Hey Mama. (laughing) Dusty: Mia dude, not Mama. Kyle: Oh sorry. Mia: Don't be. I like it. Dusty: Come in. (door closes) Mia: Help me get the door. Dusty: Dude, seriously? Mia: Yeah, you don't like it, you can leave. Dusty: It's really fucking bright. Kyle: Who's the old lady? Nora: I don't want that. Dusty: She owns the house. Mia: Eat it! Nora: No. I don't want it! Mia: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to yell. Dusty: That's it. Mia: God! (music plays) Mia: Carlos, you going to let me in or what? Carlos: What's up, baby? You've been hiding from me. Mia: No, man. I'm just trying to behave myself. Carlos: What can I do for you, sweetheart? Mia: I'm just looking for a hookup for my boys. Carlos: These two little tutti fruttis outside? Mia: Yeah, they're cool. Carlos: And you think they can handle themselves, Mia? Mia: Yeah, sure. Kyle's got the cash. (phone ringing) Carlos: Shut that fucking shit off. (phone ringing) Recording: You want me, leave a message. Julian: Yeah. I've actually left five messages. I'd like to at least get a courtesy, I don't know, text. Just call me and at least let me know that you're okay. Okay, please? (music plays) (phone ringing) Carolyn: Hello. Julian: Listen. You guys should probably come over. We need to talk. Shit. Carolyn: Maybe it's coke. Not that that would be good, but it would be better, right? Julian: No, it's meth. For sure. I knew it. I did. And I should have done something, especially after the last time he disappeared. Pete: Last time? Carolyn: He could be hurt. Julian: Carolyn, he's taken money out of the bank account and not a small amount. We both have to stop making excuses for him. Pete: Why didn't you tell me about this before, Carolyn? This is serious. Carolyn: Because I didn't want you to overreact, like you're about to right now. Pete: Don't suppose howl might react. That is not fair. If Kyle has a serious problem, it doesn't affect just him -- or just you. Carolyn: Pete, please. What do you think we should do, Julian? Julian: I just, I don't know how to find him. I don't even know where to begin. Pete: Wait. I own his cellphone. I can legally have it tracked. (music plays) Mia: Hey. Wake the fuck up. Dusty: Fuck. Mia: Dusty, you know the fucking rules. You want to stay, you watch Nora. Dusty: I know. I said that I would. Mia: That means no fucking sleeping until I get back from work. Dusty: That's why you should give me my own room. Mia: Okay. You don't pay, you don't stay. Julian: Yeah, I'm looking for Kyle. Mia: Dusty. Deal. Julian: Kyle. Kyle, come on. Get up! Come on. Get up. You stay out of it. I swear to God. I'll fucking kill you! Come on. Kyle: Come on, dude. Julian: Come on. We're going home. Kyle: No, I'm not. Julian: Come on. Kyle: I'll go home when I'm ready! Julian: You'd rather stay here with these people than come home with me? Kyle: Right now, yeah. Julian: Yeah? Okay. We'll see how long you last without access to the bank account. Kyle: You can't keep me from using that account. That's our account. Julian: You want to bet? You want to bet? That money is keeping a roof over our heads and paying for the bills, not to shoot up your goddamn nose. You want help? Pete and Carolyn will pitch in and we'll get you help. Kyle: I don't want help. I don't need help! Julian: Kyle. You're a fucking addict. You're worthless on this shit! Kyle: Fuck off! Carolyn: Julian, are you - Julian: No. You know what? You want to self destruct, that's fine. Go ahead. But I'm not going to watch. I can't bear to watch. You're fucking pathetic. I don't even know who the fuck you are. Carolyn: Kyle. Pete: Come on. Carolyn: We can't just leave him like this. (car starts) (cat meows) Kyle: Baby. Kyle: Baby. (knocks on door) (door rattling) Fuck! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just Where do you get off, Mr. High and Mighty. You started speed, too, so don't act all holier than thou. Fuck, what do want You think I won't leave? You'll be begging me to come back! I'm leaving. This is fucking bullshit. You're like all the rest. (bangs on window) Nice to know what you're really all about, fuck head. You love me? You want to marry me? Really? Really? Fuck! One little fuck up with money and that's it? So, now I know that money means more to you than I do, so that's good. That's good. I'm glad to know it, dickwad. This is the last time you're ever going to see me, so take one long look at this and kiss it goodbye. (car starts) (phone ringing) Carolyn: Hello. Kyle: Hey. Julian and I had a fight. Can I crash with you until he calms down? Carolyn: He just wants to stay for a night or two. Pete: No. No. Absolutely not. Your sister's already miscarried once. Carolyn: This doesn't concern you, Pete. Put Lynnie back on. Pete: It most certainly does concern me. You're out of control. We'll get you help, but we won't enable you. Kyle: Who are you, Dr. Phil? I don't need fucking help! Look, Julian just got pissed because I spent some of our money. It's supposed to be our money, not his money, our money, but obviously this whole let's share our lives and all this and all that is fucking bullshit. Carolyn: Just one night, Pete. Kyle: I can't believe you guys are taking his side. Carolyn: This is ridiculous. He's my brother. Pete: Until you can admit that you have a problem and ask for help, you're on your own. Carolyn: What did you just do? (rock music plays) Must be kind of scary To watch me gain my confidence back Must be kind of strange to find That you don't have control of that Must be kind of bitter sweet To think that I'm so independent You can try to break me... (siren blares) I don't see much you can do It must be kind of scary To think I could be controlling...you Kyle: It'll just be a loan, Dad. Mr. Peeples: Well, what happened to your big shot designer job? Kyle: Nothing happened. I just I felt it would be good for me to go out on my own, be an entrepreneur, you know? Mr. Peeples: As a house painter? Kyle: As a color consultant, wall treatment specialist, Dad. It's a foot in the door of my own business. You're always complaining about being a company man. Well, I wouldn't be a company man anymore. That's good, right? Mr. Peeples: That is a lot of money for painting supplies, son. Kyle: Dad. Jeez Louise. I never ask you for anything. Can you please help me out of a jam, just this once? Please? Dusty: (laughing) Let me stay, you won't regret it. Kyle: Promises, promises. Pinky: Those things aren't going to watch themselves, sweetheart. This isn't the safest neighborhood. Mia: Hey yo, Pinky girl. You trying to scare my boy? Pinky: How's your grandmama? Last time I saw her she was so confused. Mia: I know. She's getting worse. Pinky: Sugar, I'm so sorry. What's your name, darling? Kyle: Kyle. Pinky: Well, Kyle, if you need anything, Pinky's upstairs at the end of the hall, okay? Anything at all. Kyle: Thanks. Hey. Need help? Bobby: I got it, thanks. You're the new guy? Kyle: Yeah, Kyle. Bobby: Bobby Blue. (laughing) I live right there. Kyle: Okay. Bobby: You want to come in for a bit? Kyle: I still have some unloading to do. (laughter) Kyle: This will never do. (rock music plays) Dusty: Anything we want. Mia: This is fucking horrible. Kyle: Okay. There you go. That's the right place for it. Dusty: Billie. Billie: Hey, Dusty. Dusty: How's it going, gorgeous? Can I get a pitcher? Billie: Of course. Dusty: You guys, I decided that this is my alter ego. He's called Mr. Upright Citizen. Billie: Who's the new goose? Dusty: This is my buddy, Kyle. Dude, this is Billie. Billie is the shit. You ever need a place to chill, you come here. Bailed my ass out more times than I can count. Billie: Literally. Dusty: Just that once. Billie: Mi casa es su casa, Kyle. Mia: I'm going to go to the little girl's room. Be right back. Dusty: Dude, you are addicted. What do you need all those pictures for? Dusty: I was thinking, I'm going to do like a tweaker coffee table book one day. I mean, don't you think that would be fucking hot? Kyle: A tweaker coffee table book? Dusty: Yeah. Kyle: Yeah, but tweakers don't spend money on stuff like that, dude. Dusty: I don't know. It's just all I know how to do. Kyle: Yeah, but you're good enough, though. Dusty: Really? Kyle: Scout's honor. Dusty: Thanks. Dusty: Doing a little business in the john? When are you going to teach us to shoot up? Mia: Never. You're way too pretty. Dusty: Smile. You're sexy. Hello, Kyle. That's amazing. Dusty: Dude, fuck that. Let's do something. Let's hit the boulevard. Let's get ourselves into some trouble. Kyle: I hate to tell you, but we're almost out of money. We only have enough for like another eight ball. I have to make my fucking car payment. Dusty: Call your dad again. Kyle: Why don't you call your dad? Or like call one of your publicist friends or something, get a temp job, Dusty: What are you talking about? Kyle: To take pictures at an event, like when we met. Dusty: Dude, I wasn't actually working. That was just a front to find customers. Kyle: Oh. Well, we could pawn your camera. Dusty: Are you high, dude? We're not pawning my fucking camera. Kyle: Just until we make enough money to like buy it back. What are we going to do then? (music plays) Mia: You should let me brush your hair every day. Kyle: Not to point out the obvious, but you two look nothing alike. Mia: So. Kyle: So. Mia: Grandma just found me on the street and took me in. Kyle: Just like that? Mia: Just like that. Kyle: No questions asked. Nora: Not as many as you. Kyle: So where are your real parents? Mia: Who gives a fuck? (knock on door) Jude: Hello. Mia: Hey. Jude: Hey, is Luke here? Mia: Yeah, he's upstairs on the right. Kyle: Luke? Mia: Yeah. Dusty: Hello beautiful sister. Jude: Hi honey. Dusty: Hi gorgeous. How are you? You want something to drink? Any water or - Jude: You called. What do you need? Dusty: Well, first of all, I want to let you know I have been clean now, for a month. It's been really hard, but I feel really good. Jude: Good. I'm glad to hear it. Dusty: And I got a job at Benny's Diner. You know the one on Santa Monica. Jude: Good. I'm glad. Dusty: The only thing is I just started, so I'm only bussing and I'm not making any of the tips. Jude: How much? Dusty: $1500. This is for real, Jude. I'm serious. I'm two months behind and I can't hold down a job if I'm living on the streets and I can't go back to... Please. Kyle: Hey Pinky. Pinky: Well, hi. I'll save you a trip to the car. Kyle: Motherfucker. Pinky: Pinky told you to read the street signs. Alternate side of the street parking here, in this neighborhood, come on. Jude: I love you, you know. Dusty: I love you, too. Kyle: Nice car. Well? Dusty: She didn't believe me. Pinky: Well, what did you expect, handsome? Your sister ain't no peabrain. Kyle: So, what are we going to do now? Dusty: We've got to have a few rules, okay? Kyle: Mmhmm (affirmative). Dusty: Most important, and you've got to live by this, seriously, no bareback, ever. No matter how much money they offer and they will, because once the word gets out that you do it, all you get are HIV infected tricks, because no one else will risk it. Kyle: Okay. Dusty: Two, if we're doing this together, you've got to stop the picking, dude. It isn't a good sell. Kyle: I never pick my face. Dusty: They're not going to be looking at your face, sweetheart. Kyle: (laughs) You really think this is going to work? (rock music plays) Dusty: Come this way. (knock on door) Dusty: Ready for this? Mia: Ow. Male: What the fuck is she doing here? Mia: Ow. Male: Yo man, she's totally fucking with my high, man. Dusty: She's cool, man. Male: No. She's not fucking cool. Mia: Just five more minutes. No. Kyle: No five minutes. No. Nora: No, I don't want to. Mia: Grammy? Grammy! Male 2: Come on, Ma. Let's go. Nora: Where are you taking me? Male 2: We have to hurry. It's 10 o'clock. What was that? Mia: No one invited you here. Male 2: I know that. Look, Mia, I'm not going to argue with you, okay? I'm not. You have no standing in this family. I'm not going to allow you to let my mother live in this corrupt environment. Mia: Fuck off. You don't show your face around here for years and now you come around for what, your inheritance? Go back to your own fucking world. Male 2: Oh, I will go back to my own fucking world, trust me, but with her. Mia: Don't you fucking touch her. Male 2: My mother loves you. I have no idea why. I never have, but if you force this, I will get a court order and I will come back here with the police. You are not blood and you will not win. Mia: Blood doesn't make a family. Fuck you. Male 2: Okay, but it also doesn't make a law. This is illegal and this is illegal, too. Mia: You look like a pimp. Did you let him in? Nora: I didn't. I didn't he just came in. Mia: It's okay. (Nora crying) Dusty: What's your fucking deal, dude? Bobby: You think I don't know? I was spinning on ice when you were still picking your butt in high school, so don't. And you, listen to me. It's not too late for you to stop this. If I can do it, you can do it. You want to get off this ride, you know where to find me. All you have to do is ask. Kyle: Morning. Mia: Morning. Kyle: What is with all the clickety clack? Don't you ever take your shoes off? Mia: Hey, be nice, or you're not getting any of Mama's chicken pasta and for dessert Dusty: Oh shit, Mama, looks like a good night's work. Mia: It sure was. Dusty: Who was that dickwad the other day? Mia: That was Grammy's son. He's acting like he gives a shit. Whatever. Dusty: Oh. That is disgusting. Mia: Hey! Dusty: That is totally disgusting. What the fuck is that? Mia: It is French. It's rosé, you barbarians. Kyle: Here, I'll fix it. Dusty: Oh, thank you, Kyle. Count on the gay boy to fix a crappy tasting wine with vodka. I'm going to tell Billie to put this on her drink list at the bar. She can call it the Homo. Fucking Homo. Kyle: What the fuck, dude? Seriously. Go make yourself useful. Pour me another Homo. (laughter) Kyle: Do you mind? That nauseates me. Dusty: Don't be jealous, man. I love you, too. (helicopter sound) Dusty: Oh shit. Mia: Fuck. Kyle: It's alien probes. I've seen them outside. (knock on door) Kyle: Don't answer the door, seriously. Seriously. Pinky: It's Pinky. Kyle: That's not Pinky. It does not sound like Pinky. Pinky: You better open up this door in ten seconds or I'm going to break it down and beat you with it. Then you'll know it's me. Dusty: It might be Pinky. Kyle: Pinky. Hi, Pinky. Pinky: What are you all doing in here that you don't hear this poor woman wailing in the hallway? Nora: I got lost. Mia: Grammy, Grammy just go downstairs, okay? I'm sorry. Pinky: When was the last time you checked in on her? Kyle: Maybe she's hungry? You want something to eat, Nora? Mia: No, she's fine. Grammy, just go downstairs for another hour, okay? Kyle: Jesus Christ, then I'll take care of her. Pinky: How are you going to do your grandmama like that? Nora: I know where I'm going now. Pinky: Shame on you. Nora: I was looking for little Mia. She was such a pretty little baby and no trouble. No trouble at all. She misses her so much. She cries at night sometimes. Kyle: Who are we talking about again? Nora: The baby. Mia's baby. The policemen took her away from Mia. You know, you're a very nice boy. Maybe you'd marry her. She's a very good cook, you know. Kyle: I do know. (heavy breathing) Kyle: Jesus, get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here! Dusty: What's the problem? Kyle: You're just a fucking tease and I'm sick of putting up with it. You want to fuck her, get the fuck out. Dusty: Fucking A man, you knew I was straight when I moved in here. I didn't promise you shit. Kyle: You prance your little ass around here like it's doable any time you want something from me. (laughter) (yelling) Kyle: You motherfucker! Mia: Kyle. Kyle, fucking stop it! Kyle! Jesus! Stop it, Kyle, you're killing him! Get the fuck - Kyle! Kyle! Fucking stop, Kyle! Kyle: I'm sorry. I just don't get it. You suck cock for a living. I've seen you come with a dick up your ass. Dusty: I come because I'm fucking horny as fuck, smoking that Tina. There's no mystery, man. No matter how deep you think you're digging, you're not going to find it. The faggot Sorry. I'm sorry. Mia: You just have to learn how to accept it. You know, God accepts us. Dusty: God doesn't exist, Mama. If he did, he wouldn't be loving on us. Mia: Yes he does, Dusty. He loves all his children. Kyle: Like you love yours? Mia: Don't you fucking say that. I love my baby, Kyle. I love my baby and Child Services came and they took my baby. They fucking took her, but I'm going to get her back. I'm going to get her back, Kyle. I just have to get clean first. I can. Kyle: You can. So can I. (phone dialing) Julian: Yes? Kyle: Jules. I miss you. I want to come home. Julian: Are you high? Kyle: No. Kyle: We're going out, Mama. Mia: So go. Dusty: Hey. You've got to leave those sores alone. Nobody wants a scabby 'ho. Kyle: Fuck you. You aren't perfect. Dusty: You, on the other hand, you're practically old. The only thing you've got going for you is a big dick and unless you want to enter with it swinging, stop picking. Mia: Ow. Kyle: Mama. Mia: I fell asleep. Kyle: I know you did. It's time to go to bed. Mia: Just five minutes, okay? Kyle: Okay. Ready? Dusty: Bye Mama. Dusty: Weird shit. Kyle: Is this right? Dusty: No. Manny: Yeah. So you coming in? Dusty: Yeah. Kyle: Hey. Manny: Like-a? Kyle: Nice. Manny: So this how it going to go down, huh? I don't care who gives, but the other one watches, yeah? So, who's going to be the watcher? Kyle: Dusty will watch. So, what can I do to make you happy? You want me to suck your giant cock? Manny: You want to make Manny happy? Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up and you're going to lick it and like it. Fuck tard, I told you to watch! You watch. Dusty: Okay. Manny: Or I fuck your eyes out your skull. Dusty: Okay. Manny: Ooh yeah. Lick it. Yeah, lick it. Ooh. Ooh. Yeah. (laughing) You must watch. (heavy breathing) You watch, fuck tard! (laughing) Get the fuck out of here! (laughing) Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here! You want to get paid, fuck tard? Get the fuck out of here! Dusty: I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. Kyle: It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. (heavy breathing) Dusty: Are you okay? Kyle: At least he paid. Dusty: Fuck. Kyle: I can't keep going on like this. I can't. I've gotta quit. Mia: I'm going to find that motherfucker and I'm going to seriously fuck him up. Dusty: We don't need to quit like totally okay? Kyle: I can't risk that same machine again, dude. I can't. I'm not sure I'd live through it. I feel like my body would just crack and fall apart and I'd be a bunch of pieces that nobody could pick up again. Dusty: That's why Mia She's going to ask Carlos to stake us our first out, so we start dealing for real. Mia: No. Dusty: Yeah. Mia: Okay, no. Heavy dealing isn't a game. Dusty: No shit, Mama. Kyle: He barely trusts us to buy our own stash. Dusty: We have always been good for the money. This guy fucking needs us. We could open up a whole new clientele for him. Come on. All those upscale tweakers don't want to buy off some Mexican illegal, they want to buy from us. We get a wholesale stash and we make enough money to stop tricking, more than enough. Mia: Too bad, because we have to find another solution, because I'm not getting you guys involved in that. (rock music plays) Carlos: Okay. Okay, my little faggots. I'll front you your first ounce. We'll see how it goes. If you get popped, you keep your mouth shut, or you're dead. Comprende? Kyle: Si, comprende, mi amigo. Carlos: You ain't me amigo. Let's get that fucking straight right now. Get this fucking shit out of here. Mia: Are you okay? Dusty: I'm fine. Mia: You're not fine. Dusty: Okay, okay. Dusty: Maybe it's not so bad. Maybe I'm okay. Mia: No, no, honey. You're not okay. Please go inside for Mama, please. Dusty: Hey dude, can you do me a favor? Just guard my camera for me, okay? It's on the desk in the room. Kyle: Okay. Dusty: No pawning. Kyle: Promise. Dusty: Okay. Mia: It's okay. Dusty: I need to see a doctor. Nurse 1: Did you cut yourself? Dusty: No. I just don't feel good. Nurse 1: Do you have insurance? Dusty: No. Nurse 1: There's a free clinic on Santa Monica. Dusty: I don't think I can get there. Nurse 1: I'm sorry. I can't help you. Dusty: I don't think I can get there. Nurse 1: Please, don't raise your voice. I can't admit you without insurance or a recognized form of payment, like a credit card. Do you have a credit card? Dusty: No. Nurse 2: What's the problem? Cut himself? Nurse 1: No. He doesn't feel well, but he doesn't have any way to pay. Nurse 2: Thanks for covering. I've got it from here. Not feeling so great? Chills, fever? It's probably just the flu. Go home, drink plenty of fluid - Oh my God! Carolyn: Kyle. Julian: Kyle, come on. We're here to help. You called me. You reached out. Give us a chance and if you want, at the end, you can tell us all to go to hell. Come on. Mom: Dear Kyle, I remember you as a little boy, always joyful, always - Kyle: I wasn't joyful, Mom. I was just pretending to cover up how weird I felt in our own family. Mom: No one ever asked you to be any different, even when you came downstairs dressed in your cowboy outfit and pearls, honey, which killed your father. Kyle: You left us, how would you know? Mom: I didn't leave you. I left your father. Kyle: This is a waste of time. You aren't listening. Dad couldn't even be bothered to show up. Mom: I am too listening. Doctor: It was based on discussions that I had with your sister. We all thought maybe it would be more productive here today without your father. He's really concerned for you. Kyle: Whatever. This is bullshit. Lynnie did cocaine in college. What's the difference? Mom: Lynnie! Carolyn: It wasn't a big deal, Mom. We all partied at one time or another. Doctor: Listen, 80% of people who even try this drug get addicted. It's considered more addictive than heroin. Addicts have a 6% chance of staying clean, 6%, so please, can we just stay focused on Kyle? Mia: Where's Grammy? Kyle: She's out front. Pete: Kyle, come on. Just have a seat, buddy. Kyle: You're not my fucking buddy, Pete. Just psycho bullshit. I like it. I don't want to stop. Mom: Kyle! Kyle: Hey! Hey, let her go! Hey! Let her go! Julian: Kyle! Stay out of it. Male: Hey man, you better listen to your friend, okay man? Listen to your friend. You don't wan to fuck with me. Mia, I am sorry. I really am sorry. You're just going to have to find another Social Security check so you can get high. Mia: I never touched her money. Male: Oh bullshit! Mia: Why do you think we rent the house? Why do you think we rent the house? Please, she is the only family I have left. She's happy here. Male: She doesn't know any better. Look at her. You smoke this fucking drug. I'm not judging you. This awful fucking drug, this soul destroying drug in front of her. Nora: I'm sorry if I did something wrong, Mia. Please don't take my baby away from me, sir. Please. Male: I'm not taking your baby, I'm not. Mom, stop. I told you to not do this shit. Come on, let's go. Kyle: Let her go. (Nora yelling) Male: Hey motherfucker. Julian: That's enough. Come on. Male: Motherfucker, back up, dude! Julian: Enough! Male: Hey! You put a hand on me, motherfucker. Mom: Kyle. Stop, Kyle! Kyle: Get the fuck off me! Julian: You know what? I'm done. I can't. Nora: What did I do wrong, Mia? What did I do? (Nora crying) Male: It didn't have to be like this. Wake up. Wake the fuck up. Come on. This is the saddest shit I've ever been through in my life. Kyle: If I just walked off this cliff right now, do you think anyone would care? Mia: I'd care. Dusty would care. Kyle: Sometimes I think it might just be easier on everyone. I came out here for this, you know. Mia: Oh yeah, the high? Kyle: No. My freedom. A chance to start over, be who I really want to be. Mia: Who is that? Kyle: Not much, just a fabulously wealthy gay man with a hugely successful design business. That's who. I am going to quit, you know. I just don't need my family telling me when and how. They're half the problem anyway. Mia: I know. I get it. Kyle: Fucking Julian, man. Where was he when I needed him, when he was passing judgment at me and kicking me out of my own house? Mia: You still love him. Let's go see Dusty. Kyle: Okay. Mia: Will you take me somewhere first? Pretty house, isn't it? Kyle: Yeah. Mia: This is where my kid lives. Are you gonna knock? Oh my God. Girl: You're high. Mia: Is the family treating you okay? Girl: Yeah. I have to go. I'm not supposed to be talking to you. (music plays) Mia: Those are for Dusty. Kyle: Here it is. Kyle: Hey. Mia: Hey baby. Nurse 1: Oh, I'm sorry. Visiting hours are over. Kyle: Oh, well, can we just talk to him for a second? We're family. Nurse 1: You have to be quick, okay? He really needs to get some rest. Mia: Hey baby. Dusty: It's good to see you, man. Kyle: Good to see you. Mia: I miss you so much. Kyle: Yeah, we miss you. Jude: Excuse me. Can I talk to you guys out here for a second? Dusty: Okay. Mia: Hi. How's he doing? Kyle: How is he? Jude: What are you guys doing here? Kyle: What do you mean? We care about Dusty. Jude: His name is Luke. It's not Dusty. You guys pick up these names and you live these lives to get high and it's killing you and you don't even get it. Look at my baby brother. His insides are rotting, because he's been smoking and snorting, God knows what else, so he can put cleaning fluid in his body, because he thinks it feels good. When he got here, he had a peptic ulcer. It's a little hole in his stomach. The doctors are surprised that he even made it through surgery. Now, they've discovered that his small bowel is necrotic, which means literally dying. And did I fail to mention that he has blood poisoning from a sore that he picked so much that it's an inch deep? On top of that, he's detoxing. That alone would have killed a stronger person, but he's clean, finally clean. I wish that you guys would just give him a fighting chance to stay that way. Please, just stay away. Kyle: Okay. Mia: Fuck her, okay? Because Dusty told me all about her. The Ambien that she takes at night to go to sleep, the Xanax that she takes during the day to stay calm. She smokes weed, okay. She's just a fucking hypocritical ass bitch. Bobby: Hey, you okay? Kyle: What do you want? Bobby: How's Dusty? Kyle: Like you care. Bobby: Is it HIV? Kyle: No, it's not HIV. Bobby: Good, because I know how meth can affect your judgment in the moment, so to speak, and you can think, "What the fuck? What difference does it make?" It does, you know. Kyle: He's not doing so good. Bobby: I'm sorry, Kyle. I'll be praying for him. Mia: Ow. I did it again. Kyle: Yes you did. Dusty was right. High-end hotels, houses in the Hollywood Hills. It's nice to finally be playing the big leagues. I just wish he would get better soon. (knock on door) Kyle: Hey. Jude: Hey. Is Luke's camera here? I'd like to get it. Kyle: I'd have to ask Luke if I can give it to you. He was counting on me to keep it safe for him. Jude: Luke's dead. Kyle: These are the pictures he's been taking. Jude: Keep them. I don't want to know. You both seem nice enough, but my brother was lovely and he was smart and really sweet and I just don't understand why. Yeah. (electronic music plays) Kyle: Motherfucker! Billie: Where's the other musketeer? Kyle: He's right there. Billie: (laughs) He's looked better. Kyle: You can't expect much when you're dead. Billie: What? Kyle: He died, Billie. He died on us. Billie: What the fuck? Just a second. This Homo's on me. (glasses clink) To Dusty... Mia: Hey baby, can I use your computer when we get inside? I promise I'll give it back to you. Kyle: Sure baby. What's on my computer that you always need to get in it so badly all the time? Mia: Oh, you know, my kid. She's got a page online. Carlos: Where is my fucking Rolex? Mia: Kyle. (knocks on door) Carlos: He's busy right now, Mia. Mia: Carlos, why is the door locked? Carlos: Kyle and I just have a little business to attend to. Mia: Carlos, open the fucking door. Carlos, for the love of God, open the fucking door! Carlos: You're not invited to this little party, mija. Neither are you. Bobby: Open the door or I'm calling the cops. Mia: Bobby, fucking shut up. Carlos: Are you scared now, little faggot? Where is it? I'm not playing no more. Where is my fucking Rolex? Oh, no, no. No you don't, fucker. No you don't. No, no. (laughing) And that motherfucking Rolex is real. My old lady bought it for me and I want it back, but if you think it's worth your life, we can keep playing this game. Pinky: Oh good lord. Mia, why do you have a knife? Put it down. Kyle: No. Mia: Pinky, he's in there, you've got to break the door down. Carlos: Then again, what have you got to live for, really? Mia: Break the door down! (gunshot) Mia: Oh God. Pinky, did I kill him? Pinky: He's dead. Mia, really, now? Must you? Mia, Kyle is okay. He's okay, baby. Let's get you untied, let's get you untied. Mia: He should've known not to mess with one of my boys. It's okay, baby. We've got to get you someplace safe. You don't think his boys are going to wonder where he's gone? Pinky: Oh, jeez. Mia: You don't think Carlos is going to tell every one of his fucking stupid junkie friends that you stole his Rolex? Kyle: It wasn't real. Pinky: Real, my dumplings, is besides the point. Kyle, you need to go and pack your bags and hide away for a couple of weeks or three. Go! Come on, come on, baby. Over here. Come on, baby. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Let Pinky take care of this. Okay. We need to clean this mess up. Mia, honey, I think you should stay, okay? Pinky's got this. Kyle: Thank you. Pinky: Where's the step? Watch the step. Kyle: Oh fuck. Pinky: What? Kyle: My car. My car's gone. Pinky: What do you mean your car is gone? Did you park it on a different block? Kyle: No, I didn't. I parked it right here, right fucking here. Pinky: Did you pay those parking tickets? It must have gotten towed. There's nothing about this moment that Pinky likes, nothing at all. Kyle: We have to use your car. Pinky: No, no, no. Pinky does not like that idea. Kyle: Thank you. Bye Pinky. I don't suppose, no I don't suppose. Someone's sleeping in my bed, Someone's let the genie in I don't suppose, no I don't suppose You know who you are Who you are... Landlord: Yo, Mr. Peeples. Kyle: Yeah. Landlord: You plan on paying your rent? Your next week coming due. Kyle: I know, jeez. Landlord: Well, you know I ain't running no charity case. Kyle: I know. I'll have it. Landlord: Don't be late. (grunting) (knock on door) Kyle: Hold on. Kyle: You don't look so hot. Bobby: Neither do you. Kyle: How did you...? Bobby: Look, it's bareback or nothing at all, all right. I'll pay top dollar for it. Kyle: You're my trick? Bobby: Yeah, baby boy. You want my cash or not? Bobby: What's the matter? You getting your period or something? Kyle: You're a 12-stepper. Bobby: Yeah. It got old. Life is hard. Want some? Straighten your arm out. Come on, make a fist. Consider it a tip. Kyle: Thanks. Bobby: See you around, Kyle. (door opens and closes) (phone ringing) Mia: Hey baby. Kyle: Mama. Mia: How's my boy? Kyle: Hi. You've got to come get me. I think something's wrong. Male: I'm not paying you to talk on the phone. Mia: Listen, baby, Mama's busy right now, okay? Can I come out in like an hour or so? Kyle: No, I need you to come get me now. Please. Please, Mama. Mia: I've got to go. (knock on door) Kyle: Mia? Pinky: Kyle? Kyle, honey, you in there? Hi baby. Oh Jesus, lord in heaven, you look awful. Kyle: I have really, really bad cramps. Oh baby, what kind of cramps? They're in my stomach and they hurt. I haven't shit in a long time. How long has it been? I don't know, like weeks. Pinky: Kyle, baby. Kyle: I can't go in there. Pinky: Kyle. Kyle: I can't, I can't. Just take me to like a pharmacy or something and get some laxatives. Pinky: You're telling me you haven't tried that yet? Lord. Kyle: Thank you, Pinky. Pinky: You sure you're okay? I don't mind coming in for a spell and keeping you company. Pinky: I'll be fine. Truly, I'll be fine. Pinky: Kyle. You know I don't judge. It's just you deserve better than this. Pinky wants better than this for you. Kyle: Thank you, Pinky. (coughing) What the fuck? (yelling) (yelling) (shower running) (music plays) (phone ringing) Mr. Peeples: Hello. Kyle: Dad. I think I'm in trouble. If I don't come home now... Mr. Peeples: Can you get to LAX? Kyle: Yeah. I think so, I think so. Mr. Peeples: There'll be a ticket waiting at Southwest. I'll have your sister come meet you. Kyle: Okay. Thanks Dad. (music plays) Kyle: LAX, please. I'll never walk away You know I'd fix the time Come slowly to me It's gettin' harder to breathe Am I willing to survive I'll be taken alive I'll never be your fall I'll never walk away With nothing left to hide I'll sleep soundly tonight While the masses collide Though my fortune's untold, there's a long way to go
