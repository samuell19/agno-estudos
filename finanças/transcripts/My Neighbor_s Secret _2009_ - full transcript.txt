Booked us a great hotel on Lake Shore Drive. You're gonna love Chicago. Seem a bit nervous there, Gretch. You OK? And I want to single out one person on our design team. He's only been with us for nine months, but his tireless efforts brought this commission on on time and under budget. Fred Keller. Here, here. Here, here. Thank you, Nick. I'm not used to so much praise. They thought I might ask for a raise. Cheers Cheers. Cheers. You did a great job, Brent. The restaurant looks amazing. Too bad Gretchen couldn't be here. Well, unfortunately, she had a big client presentation. But thank you. So what times are we meeting with Mr. Curlicue tomorrow? 10:00 a.m. Sharp. I have to remember to set my watch back an hour. I always forget that. Don't worry, I'll remind you. Can't have you showing up too early. Hey. Your wallet! It's Gretchen. Please leave a message. Hey, Gretch, it's me. We're still at Bel Canto. Just give me a call, OK? Bye. Hello? Is this Mr. Keller? Yes, this is Brent Keller. This is Detective Neal. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your wife is dead. Uh... I'm sorry. I don't think I heard you. We found her body in a parking lot at the airport. It looks like she was murdered. Oh, god, no. I'm sorry, Mr. Keller. We're still gathering information, but looks like a robbery. She was with another man who also got it the same. You were with Mr. Keller all evening? Mm-hmm. We work together at Morphic Architecture. We were celebrating the opening of one of our new buildings. Did either of you know Mrs. Keller? She didn't make it to many office functions. She'd just gone back to work at some ad agency downtown. Oh, they were crazy in love. Practically newlyweds. All right. That's great. Thanks. That's all we need for now. If you need any help... contacting people, making arrangements, whatever, I'm here for you. OK? Brent. We just heard. Sean's sister called us with the news. We're so sorry. Jason and I saw you getting home. We know it's late, but we had to come by. Is there anything we can get you? Do you want to come over for a while? You really shouldn't be alone. My wife's never coming home. I don't know what I'd do if anything ever happened to you. Have you checked the security camera tape? Anybody come forward yet? It's been less than 24 hours, Mr. Keller. Well, what about any witnesses? Any fingerprints? We're doing everything possible. No, apparently you're not, detective. The guy who killed my wife is still out there. All right, listen. We've run the bullet casings. There were no matches at IBIS. Whoever did this was just looking to score some quick cash. There was nothing left at the crime scene. No credit cards, driver's license. Your wife traveled to Chicago on business with Mr. Miller? Yeah. She had a presentation with a client. Ever since we've been married, we've never spent the night apart. Did your wife and Mr. Miller socialize much outside the office? What kind of a question is that? You people don't seem to understand. I've got a funeral to plan. And I don't even know where to begin. Cremation or burial? I don't know, we didn't talk about that stuff. We talked about starting a family, about building a nursery, about what to name our kids. I'm sorry. I can't do this right now. Do you guys mind if I go? Sure. Sure. He can come over and play. If you're late picking him up, don't worry about it. - OK. - Oh, I gotta go. Jason's home. - Bye. Bye. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The schedule was crazy. And then, uh, was in the middle of my charts, and Paula asks me to help her out with a consultation. Ever since you joined the practice, you've spent more time with her than us. Honey, come on. You know that's not true. It's the flu season. This happens every year. It'll be over in a few weeks. How about a glass of wine? Yes. Have you, uh, seen or talked to Brent lately? The, uh, lights are off over there again. No. Not since the funeral last week. Yeah. We should really check in. Oh, I did. Left three messages. Nothing. I'll walk over tomorrow with Austin. Yeah, thanks for understanding, Nick. Take all the time you need. Yeah. I'll probably get more work done from home anyway. That's right. Hopefully, I'll be back in a couple weeks. I knew I could count on you. Absolutely, Brent. Hang in there. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Daddy! Guess what? What? I got an A in math. You did not. Did you? I did, look! Did you? Oh, my. Oh, my god! I knew it! I knew it, dude! Ahhh! When's the last time you had a home-cooked meal? Come in. Ah, you didn't have to go to all this trouble. You're a saint. You know, if you ever want to stop by and just talk, I'm home writing. Mm-hmm. And I use that word loosely. Oh, the book not going well? It hasn't been a good year. I've never had writer's block like this. Well, the great American novel was not written in a day. I think I'll be remembered more for writing grocery lists and sick notes for Austin. Yeah, don't be so hard on yourself. Hey, when am I going to be able to read one of these books? Well, I've got boxes of them in the basement. I can drop some by. Oh, great. Hi! I'm Kimberly, Brent's assistant. Casey from across the street. The writer! Cool. I love creative people. Oh, is that lasagna? Mm. I wish I could still eat carbs. Where do you want these? Office. OK. Bye. Hey, I got an idea. I don't want you to lose the sales, so why don't I go to Chatterdon's and pick up a couple of the books, and, uh, you have to promise to autograph. Them for me. All right. Great. So how's it going? Oh... um, well, I've never felt so alone. And the pain is unbearable. And I swear that I can feel it in the depths of my soul. I'm sorry, Brent. Wow. Maybe, uh, maybe you should be the writer. Yeah. Can I use that someday? Yeah, but you gotta pay me a royalty. You know, a couple years ago, I lost my younger brother Matt in a car accident. A drunk driver hit him. How long did it take before, uh, you started to feel... Before I could erase his messages off my voice mail? Look at his picture without crying? Well, I guess I better go. I guess so. Um, let me show you out. OK. I keep thinking they're waiting for her to come home, like she went to the store and she'll be back in a minute. You know what helped me the most? Grief counseling. Yeah, my whole life people have been telling me what to do. I'm not really big on therapists. Well, me neither. But I realized there was a part of me that didn't want to stop grieving, because it meant letting go of Matt. Anyway, just hang in there. Now, call if you need anything. OK. "He had proposed to her on a summer day as they walked along the beach. A beautiful golden seashell lay at her feet, and she had insisted on taking it with her. And now, as she held it, she could almost hear him saying, I want to be with you forever." I've been painting flowers since I was a kid... since I first picked up a crayon. I know... it's such a girl thing. No, not at all. It's amazing. The way you capture life. I... I don't know how you do it. Beautiful. Gretchen. Will you marry me? Say yes. You know you want to. Say yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! Brent. I was gonna stop by later. How are you doing? Oh, better. I have my ups and downs. But thanks for asking. I'm going to be working from home for a while, and a couple months ago you and Jason mentioned something about remodeling? I've always wanted to redo the kitchen, but we avoided it when Austin was younger. Oh, well, if you're interested, sometimes I act as my own contractor. Being across the street would make it really easy for me to oversee construction. I can save you a lot of money. Look, and I need a passion project right now, can you see? Just something to take my mind off things. You know, the timing might be good. I'll talk to Jason about it. Thanks. I've taken up enough of your time. God, you're on fire this morning. It's all those carbs. Casey's lasagna was out of this world. Yeah. You know, I think, uh, I think she works out her frustrations about writing through cooking, you know? Hey, did she, uh, talk to you about the renovation work? She did. And I think it's a great idea. But look, I gotta warn you... uh, blueprints make me crazy. So you're going to have to deal with Casey. That's cool. Hey, do you mind if I stop by and take a look? Uh, yeah, no. What? Is that that same leg hurting? Yeah. It's the leg I broke as a kid. It never healed right. Hm. Now my body's acting all creaky, and I can't sleep at nights. Come on, considering what you've been through, it's understandable. Do you take any medication right now? Yeah. I'm on every sleeping pill imaginable. Nothing works. When was the last time you had a physical? Well, it was before we left Amsterdam. I don't really have an internist here in Philly. You live across the street from one. All right? What? You don't trust me? All right, McDreamy. I'll make an appointment. Mm. All right. So I had a very interesting conversation yesterday. Austin's teacher called. He told her he didn't do his homework again because of soccer practice. Anyway, I thought we could go down to the school and talk to her. I don't want to pull him off the team, but we need to do something. I've got a meeting with my editor at 2:00, but I could meet you there after? Oh. Eh, you know what? Can we shoot for later in the week? I promise I'll make some time. Jason. When in this is going to stop? I'm just asking for equal time for Austin and me. Yeah, see, I don't think that's what this is about. This schedule is killing us. Well, yeah! I'm teaching three nights a week, and I'm up for the chair of the curriculum committee, and this is the exact wrong time for me to cut back. It's not just the teaching. It's the board of regents meetings, the medical association, the fund raisers. You're afraid something's going to happen again? This is how it started before. It's only been a year. I won't go through that again. Morning, Dr. Hest. Hey, Emily. Welcome back from vacation. Thanks. Morning, Doctor. Morning. You have that look today. Mm. Getting off to kind of a rough start this morning. Hang in there. You know, if we harvest this porch, I could double the size of this kitchen. And the piece de resistance... your very own bread oven. Oh, my god. You're no ordinary cook, Casey. You deserve the best. You're kind of like, uh, Mrs. Thibodaux winning the lottery. You've read my book? Yeah. I'm halfway through "Barcelona Summer." You're an incredible writer. Jason should be very proud of you. He is. But he's not a fiction guy. Mostly medical journals, the occasional biography. Based on what you told me about your brother, I'm guessing the main character's based on him? You know, very few people got that. When Jason read it, he didn't realize it was Matt. Your book was healing. It helped me a lot with Gretchen. Yeah. Oh! Whoa! Careful. Sorry. Ah. Austin. Do you have any old photographs of your house and your family I can borrow? Why? Well, I know it sounds strange, but it's kind of a surprise. Look, I know you and Jason as neighbors, but I have no sense of how you guys live here in the house day to day. I don't have any copies. These are originals. They're very close to my heart. I'm trusting you with my family. I see you helped yourself to their cash. Uh, a guy's got to eat. Think of it as my bonus, all right? I did everything you told me. Now it's time to pay the piper. I thought we should celebrate. You too good to drink with me? Of course not. I'm just not much for hard liquor. ...Saintly enough to avoid the booze, but ready to get down and dirty when it comes to the cheating wife. So, uh, how long was she screwing him? I'm trying my best to put her out of my mind. You marry for life. Hopefully, you do it once, you do it right. There's no greater sin than a woman's betrayal. Tell that to my old lady. Ah, somebody hurts you, you hurt them back. That's how my father was. You messed with him, he'd come back looking for a pound of flesh. I bet he beat the crap out of you. He broke my leg when I was six. I learned my lesson. I never crossed him again. Don't blame your wife, man. Blame her boyfriend. All right? It's always the guy. Guys are dogs. It wasn't his fault. Jason started it. I thought his name was Sean? Jason's been trying to break up my marriage since the first day we met. Uh, you have, uh, such a... a strong visual sense. Have you ever thought about working in advertising, or... Naw. Gretchen's not interested. Yeah, because you can do it freelance. It doesn't take up too much time. I, uh, have an old fraternity buddy who works at one of the big ad firms here in town. They do very high end stuff. I think they would pay a fortune for your talent. Art and commerce don't mix. Come on. Of course they do. I mean, look what happens every time a Warhol goes on the auction block, right? You have to excuse my husband. His mother was an art curator. Guilty. But listen, Gretch... no pressure. But if and, and when you're ready, give me a call at the office and I'll set up an introduction. ...Looks like you can use a refill. I thought you'd never ask. I been with a lot of women, man. I'll tell you, you can't trust the bitches. They throw everything right back in your face. Not all of them, Lonnie. Some of them are amazing women like Casey. They come into your life when you least expect it. And everything changes. Make sure the bid includes all the demolition and cleanup, then get back with me by the end of the week. All right? Mm-hmm. OK. See you. I'll put on some coffee, and there's homemade croissants on the table. Oh, great. Thanks. Hey, how do you want me to lock up? Oh, um, our spare. Just leave it under the planter when you go. I'm gonna be downtown all day, and Austin's got soccer, so I won't be available until after 5:00. OK. OK? Bye. Bye. Now, call if you need anything. Casey, wait. This is the Hest residence. Leave a message. Hi. Casey. Call me when you get in. No biggie, just wanted to say hi. Here. I gotta go. See ya. Hey. Hey, Mom. Hurricane Austin makes landfall. How was school today, honey? Mom, you're supposed to be putting these up. How is anyone going to know? I know, I know. All right. Put your seat belt on, let's go. 3:10? Hey, you guys are home early. Yeah. The soccer field was muddy, so the coach cancelled practice. Oh. How did it go? You'd be surprised how much I accomplished. Hello. Hey, little buddy, what you doing? Well, hello, Jason. What are we hiding? COMPUTERIZED FEMALE - Access granted. OK, now... oh. Ooh. Up you go. Nice. Yep. The best seat in the house. Now, where did you go? Mm. My god, you smell good. What is that? Is that a girl in your bed? Feels good. Aw, come on Jason. Get in the game. I'm gonna be at Chatterdon's this morning nailing things down for the reading. Want to meet for lunch? Uh... yeah, I'd love to, but, uh, schedule's jammed, and, uh, well, Mayor Morris is coming in for a 2:30 meeting. Say hello. We owe him a dinner. His poll numbers aren't looking so good. Yeah. Well, that's the least of his worries. He met with his oncology team yesterday. Cancer's back. So I told them I wanted to be the one to tell him. Oh, Jason. I'm sorry. ...You beat this stuff into remission, and, well, I guess the timing couldn't be worse, you know? No, Jason. The timing couldn't be better. This is Dr. Hest. Jason, looks likes you're one of the three finalists. That's terrific. I trust you're still interested in the position. Absolutely. No, I... I look forward to hearing from you. - Good. - Thank you so much. All right. - Bye. Bye now. Well, that's great news. Uh, search committee narrowed the list to three names. So you are looking at the possible new chair of the curriculum committee. Mm? That's... great. Austin, go get your coat. We have to get going. OK. So, uh, Paula and I discussed this. What we're going to do initially... Paula? How about talking to your wife first? OK. Let's go. Bye, Dad. I'll see you, kiddo. Hey. Hi. Is there any way Dr. Hest can see me today? We're really good friends, and he told me just to stop by. Fill this out, and, uh, I'll see what I can do. Fantastic. Do you have Mr. Gehrlig's file? Yes. I've got Mr. Gehrlig in room two for you. RECEPTIONIST:... to see you. He says you told him to drop by. How's your mom doing? Oh, false alarm. She got confused with the thermostat. Her house was like a sauna. Until I find an assisted living situation I can handle, then she's gonna have to live with me. OK, I'll let him know. Well, you're in luck. The doctor will see you. Thanks. I thought so. Just worry what it'll be next. Is that Jason's partner, Dr. Fisher? Yeah. She's really nice. Ah, Mr. Mayor. Dr. Hest is ready to see you. So, why am I here, Jason? Why the sudden appointment? Cancer's back. Oh, god. It's a Stage IIA melanoma, but I think we got on the front end. I'm running against a guy half my age, Jason. How's this going to look? Well, obviously, chemo can be tough. But, uh, you know, maybe you want to rethink a few things. I can't go public with this. All right. Look, you know, I'm... I'm just your doctor. You know, I'm not your campaign advisor. Obviously, treatment from our end is confidential. Hey. We beat this back before, and we'll do it again. Right? Yeah. All right. Dr. Hest in Dr. Fisher's office. Doctor. Hm? A 2 is first, and your friend's in B 3. Hey, where's that cheery face I'm used to seeing first thing in the morning? Yeah, I've been doing this for a while, you know? Nothing prepares you for a day like today. Why don't you hop up on the table there. I wanted to check your blood pressure. It's a little bit high. Yeah. I wouldn't blame yourself. Blame myself for what? It's strange how things happen. Left turns in life you never see coming. I mean, you introduce Gretchen to Sean, he hires her, they go away on that business trip, and then something horrible happened. Brent. You know that I was trying to help, right? You know, sometimes I wonder, if they had never met, if she'd still be here, if she'd be pregnant by now. I don't know what to say. ...Uh, I, I'm sorry, Jason. I didn't mean to upset you. I'm still trying to make sense of it all. I mean, you never expected any of this to happen, right? I have a little surprise for you. I got someone I really want you to meet. He's a very good friend of mine. Happens to be one of the top ad guys here in town, and he might be able to help you. Great. Sean Miller? This is Gretchen Keller, and, uh, her husband, Brent. Gretchen, as in the amazing brilliant painter. Jason, you never let up, do you? Sean is the guy who came up with the campaign for the new T2 cellphone. Oh. Oh, every time I open up a newspaper, I can't escape it. I suppose in your line of work, that's a compliment. Rising star of Dimension Vanderbilt. Yeah, they're the biggest ad firm here in town. Oh. Those images Jason emailed me were phenomenal, Gretchen. Thank you. They were part of a plein air series I did in Amsterdam. You sent Jason your artwork? Yeah. He's been after me ever since he saw that canvas, so I brought a disk over to his office the other day. As I told you on the phone, most of our freelancers start part time, but... Oh, you two have spoken already. While I was at Jason's, he put in a call to Sean. Yeah, I wanted to get the ball rolling. Yeah, I'd really love to see your portfolio. Yeah. Hey, you know, that's very kind of you, Sean, but my wife is really very busy. Brent, come on. I mean, how often do you get to meet someone with Gretchen's talent? She deserves her day in the sun. Jason, I'd... I'd rather you didn't. Hey. What are you guys up to? Oh, it looks like, uh, Sean might want Gretchen to work for him. That's fantastic. Well, let's not put the cart before the horse, shall we? I feel like a matchmaker here. You know, maybe I missed my calling. He's the one. He had priors for possession and aggravated assault. The rap sheet goes on and on. His prints were on everything. I want to see him. It's not going to be possible. Detective Ruiz? Excuse me a second. He's dead. Yeah, it looks like an accidental overdose. Where's her ring? I, I, I don't see it here. He probably sold it. That was the one thing I wanted. He took away the most important thing in my life. He got everything he deserved. Damn him! I'm sorry. Just... just give me a minute? Detective Neal. Hey, we got forensic results in the Hopkins case. Looks like a normal match. Same collection I did the DNA... What's going on? Oh, I don't know. It started sputtering, and then it just died. I've got a meeting with my editor downtown, he's got playoffs later, Jason's tied up on campus. What a day. Look, why don't you go to the garage with the car and just take a cab back. I'll take Austin to school. We'll meet you at the game later. He's been on my case anyway to com watch him play. Mom, that'd be awesome. Really? Yeah. Are you sure? Absolutely. After everything you've done for me, it's the least I can do for you. You ready to go, buddy? Yeah. Say goodbye to your mom. Bye, Mom. Bye. Bye. Ah. There you are. Access granted. Morris. Hm. Stage Ila melanoma. Ouch. Thank you. Philadelphia Observer. Yes. Hi. I'd like to speak your political editor, David Brown. Can you hold for a moment, please? Yeah, I'll hold. David Brown. Hi, Mr. Brown. I have a story for you about our mayor that I think you might find very interesting. Why didn't you tell me you took your artwork over to Jason's office? Because I didn't think anything would come of it, and I didn't want to get my hopes up. Sometimes I get tired of being at home by myself, Brent. Painting's a lonely life. Ah. I know it sounds old fashioned, but, ah... I want to protect you from that world. It's all smoke and mirrors. I can take care of myself. I want to pursue this. Think it would be good for me. Just start part time, like Jason suggested. Hey. Did you figure out what was wrong with the car? Water in the gas tank. I think I got contaminated gas last time I filled up. It'll be ready tomorrow. You're sweet to do this for Austin. Ah, poor guy was so upset that his dad couldn't make it, I thought he was gonna cry. Says he's always at work with Paula. What is that, one of the nurses? His partner at the clinic. Ah. That's right. I met her the other day. She's divorced, gorgeous, a doctor. I'm sure she's no competition for you. Go, Austin! Come on! Come here, buddy. That goalkeeper is way off his line. Sometimes he's well out of the net. Take an outside shot. Yeah, I know it's risky, but it may be worth it. I don't know. They're creaming us. Hey, you can do it, buddy. All right, now put on that game face, all right? Get out there. Come on. OK. All right. I owe you big time. And I intend to collect big time. Let's go, Austin! Come on! You can do it! Yes! All right! Whoo! Good game. We won, yay! You seem quiet. Aw, it's just days like today that I really miss her. Give yourself time, Brent. There's no justice, Casey. The guy who did this will never pay the price for what he did to me. You mean the drug addict? Right. The drug addict. You know, if he were still here, I would take away everything that was important in his life. His job, his family. And then he'd know what it was like to be completely alone... the way he left me. I'm sorry. I... I still get a little angry when I... when I think about it. Woo! Whoa! Hey! You were amazing. Great job out there, my friend. You're amazing. What did I say about the game face, huh? Looks like it worked. - It worked, right? - Yeah, it did. You want to get out of here? You hungry? Yeah. Let's go. All right. Let's do it. Hey, Brent. Thanks for coming to my soccer game today. Oh, you bet, buddy. Go start your bath, OK? OK. What a great day. It reminds me that I can still have all this. Of course you can, starting with me. Thanks again. Yeah. All right. Show time. Starting with the old, and ending with your new dining and sitting room. Incredible. How do you do that? Dah... trade secret. Wow. It is like we get to test drive our new house without spending a dime. Do you have a drawing of the remodeled husband doing dishes in the remodeled kitchen? Even I have my limitations. No way. A fireplace? They make a zero clearance model. I can vent it to the wall. Oh, my god. It's amazing. Let's do it. All right. I'll draw up the contracts. But before we're done, the most important aspect. No! That's awesome. Hello? Hey, Paula. Hey. Did you see the paper? Yeah. Paula, this looks bad. Really bad. Who would do such a thing? I don't know, but I can't imagine it would be anyone from our office. Have you spoken to the mayor yet? No. Return my phone call. That's where we at? Well, there are radio stations and newspapers on the phone. There are more reporters outside with TV cameras. - Yeah. - What are we going to do? Well, I just got off with Sid Gamsby. He's in the middle of a deposition, so he said he'd call us later. But he did say, shut everything down for the rest of the day. Send all the phones to voice mail. Just close down the office until tomorrow. This violates HIPAA law. We could lose our license. You mean if the leak came from this office, right? Yeah. Doctors? Someone from the state board of ethics is on the phone. Who wants to take it? It had to come from our office. I mean, there were literally details taken right from my case notes in the report. But there's only three people with security clearance to get into the AMR, so... Well, could it have been Deborah? She gave her two weeks' notice. Maybe she's retaliating? Yeah. I don't know what to think anymore. Yeah, you're right, though, about Paula. Whenever... since she became partner, Deborah has been miserable. I wish she had fired her years ago when she mixed up that medication order. Is that gonna be in public too? God, I hope not. I... I had the same thought. I asked Sid about it. He said it would depend on the scope of the ethics investigation. Ethics investigation. God, I cannot believe this is happening. ...We're gonna get through this, honey. I'm sorry. Jason, that's OK. What is going on? The reading this afternoon. Want something that looks professional, but not corporate. Something a little arty. Casey, I am so sorry. I... you know, with all that's been going on, I... I completely forgot you had the reading this afternoon. She's a writer, Jason. She lives to write. What is there to forget? You know what? You're gonna be amazing. And. And then you know what I think we should do? I think we should go out tonight. You know? We deserve the night out. I'm gonna... No, you don't. I've got other plans for you. It's OK. No. It's not OK! Calm down. I'm sitting in the dark! None of the lights will come on? N... no. Uh, and the heat's out. The furnace went out, too? Eh, eh, no... I don't know. OK. Put a sweater on until I can get over there. Paula. Well, hurry up. Yes, Mom. I'll be right over. Please! OK. Bye. What's going on? She says the power's out. And the woman I have that comes in during the day to take care of her is out of town. So she's really stressed out. I got to get over there. Mm. I have some late patients. Can you cover for me? N... no. I'm actually already late for Casey's reading, so... Oh, no, well, they were in yesterday, but we had to shut down. One's got a high temp, the other's got acute bronchitis. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency. OK. Yeah. I'll do it. Hey. Hi. I thought you could use a friendly face. Well, what are you doing here? I wanted to hear you say those two perfect sentences you wrote. You're so sweet. Did you come with Jason? No, but I'm sure he'll be here in a minute. I mean, missing this would be grounds for divorce, right? Hey. Hey. You should see this place, Jason... it's packed. I'm so nervous. Are you having trouble parking? No, I'm... I'm actually stuck here at the office. Look, I'm... I'm not going to be able to make it, honey. I'm sorry. No. I, I understand. Look, Paula had to leave. - Paula. - Yeah. It's an emergency. An emergency? Yeah. Listen, I have to go. We're about to get started. All right. Jason's not coming? The one time I need him to be here. You don't need anybody, Casey. Today is all about you and your writing. OK? "Ghosts of Amherst" by Casey Hest. Chapter one, "Adrift." "Claire stood on the porch of their beach house, staring out to the turbulent sea. The bitter wind caressed her face as she remembered the last time she and Coll had been together on this spot. He had told that he loved her. How many other lies had he told her that weekend? She never felt so alone, an aching that came from the depths of her soul... a pain wrought of abandonment and betrayal. "Her husband of nine years would be leaving her for another woman. She'd never been unfaithful to her husband until today. But she couldn't stop thinking about the new man in her life... how they'd make love for hours, the smell of salt spray on his skin." Hey. Hey. So the owner said this is the biggest crowd they've ever had for a local author. I think they really liked it. Hello? Did you hear the applause? When are you going to learn to take a compliment? Hey, you know, we should celebrate. There's a new champagne bar that opened on Main. Oh, yeah, I read about it. They're supposed to have great jazz. Its early. You have a sitter for the evening. Come on. You know you want to go. You deserve it. I want to do this for you. Mm. I can't. I'm sorry, Brent. I have to get home. Oh, come on Jason. You could do better than that. Yellow roses? If you really loved her, you'd bring red, buddy. You know, I feel terrible. How'd it go? Great. Yeah? My editor was thrilled, crowd was terrific. There was only one thing missing. I don't know what to say. I mean, um, I didn't really have a choice, you know? Of course you had a choice. It was an emergency. Paula needed me. Then apparently, I didn't. Look, can we talk about this? What's there to talk about? I've heard enough excuses for one night. That's right, Casey, shovel it right back at him. Anything here? Yeah. Well, the data transfer seems to be going... Have they found anything? Uh, no. Not so far. All the logons were cleared with security cards. But they told me there won't be anything conclusive for a few days, so... I think we should cancel on the diabetes foundation on Thursday. Uh, this is the things that's honoring you for your pro bono work, right? Yeah. But it just doesn't feel right. Yeah. I mean... look. I think showing up makes a statement that we're going to fight this thing. You're their guest of honor. It's a great cause. We're going. Hm? My god, what's going on? Don't ask. Hey, thanks for coming by. I actually have those, uh, construction contracts for you in my office, so... Hey, do you want to get a drink? Yeah. Actually, you know what, I might have time before class if, uh... Jason, I'll cover for you. You saved me last night. All right. Thanks. All right, I'll be right with you. Hi. I'm Paula Fisher. I know. Jason told me about your remodeling plans. Sounds wonderful. Take good care of him. He's my number one priority. It's been a tough year for us, you know... lot of changes and challenges. Trouble is, I just... I got so many distractions right now, I just... I'm not doing a very good job of making her happy. No, that's not true. Jason, you and Casey are like the perfect couple. Listen, you just gotta relax. You know, you got a lot of good people around you. Like Paula at your work. I mean, she seems like a terrific lady. Mm. Casey doesn't always see it that way. Yeah, Paula's the reason I missed the book reading. Mm. Hm. ...Paula and I... we, uh, we have a diabetes foundation dinner this Thursday. And uh, the problem is, I tell Casey that, I mean, she'll go through the roof? Yeah, well, why burden her with a non-event? You know, go to the dinner. Yeah, she worries a lot, especially when it comes to you. Oh, you really are getting to know her. Yeah. Why make her miserable? You know... just don't tell her. Nah. I don't know. That doesn't feel right to me. Well, with all due respect, this isn't about how you feel, Jason. I mean, you are doing this for Casey, right? Ah, god... I'm late. I gotta run. Nah, then I got this. You got it? Oh, yeah. All right. Hey, thanks. This was good. Guess I needed this. All right, um, I'll see you. Sean. What a surprise. Hey, Brent. I just dropped by to pick up some concept drawings. She is amazing, just like Jason promised. Did Gretch tell you the news? Oh, not yet. Our Chicago clients, the Ritz hotel family, flipped out over your wife's design for the new logo, and, well, they want her to join me for the presentation next week. In Chicago. Yeah, the windy city. Gretchen's going to love it, aren't you? Ah. I gotta go. OK. I'll let myself out. OK. Look, I know what those presentations are like, Gretch. People say horrible things about your work while you're still sitting there. You don't need to be a part of that dog and pony show. It's only two days. Jason was right. I really miss working. I... I don't want to hear another word about Jason. What are you talking about? This is all good. The exposure's really important for my career. For your career? Listen to yourself, Gretch... groveling to sell corporate logos in the windy city. Well, Sean and I both agreed that... Sean is not your husband. I want to go, Brent. Are you sleeping with him? What's wrong with you? How could you even think such a thing? I love you, Brent. But I don't understand you lately. You still haven't answered my question. Of course I'm not sleeping with him. Kimberly, hello. Hi. OK, this is strange. I was just going through the bills, and you have a gasoline charge on the 10th down on Canal Street. Uh, well unless I was visiting a soup kitchen, it wasn't me. Listen, I... I really don't have time for this right now, so... Well, I think someone's been using your number. What? I looked at your schedule for that day, and you were all the way across town on the Venturi job site until 4:30. All right. I'll... I handle it. Just, uh, just leave it alone. Well, Brent... I said, I'll handle it! Brent? I, uh, I'm sorry. I just got a million things going on right now. I gotta go. ...Too late to have second thoughts? Hello? - Mr. Venturi. - Yes? Hi. It's Kimberly from Morphic Architecture. Hi. Yes, I'm just doing some accounting, and we billed you for a site visit on the 10th with Brent Keller. Oh, on the 10th? No, that's a mistake. He canceled that day. He canceled? Yep. Oh, OK. Thanks. I'll make the correction. Thank you. Bye. Good morning, Dr. Hest. Good morning. Hey. You're looking sharp for a Thursday morning. You never wear that suit to work. Yeah. I got a meeting with Sid in our malpractice insurer. Should be a lovely morning. Oh, by the way, uh, go ahead and have dinner without me. I have a late meeting with the curriculum committee. I thought they were done. Yeah. I think they probably just want to talk about the whole situation with the mayor. So... You're a natural born liar, Jason. You really want this job, don't you? I gotta go. Wish me luck. Good luck. Canal Street. Same day. Hey. Sorry. Oh, it's all right. We got plenty of time. Hey. What are you still doing up? I was anxious to hear how everything went tonight. Oh, uh... you know, I think, uh, I don't know, I think the research committee will probably have an answer any day now, so... Great. What did they ask about? You know, family and uh... research, work ethic. I'm sure you answered with your usual candor. Yeah. Look, I, uh... I'm beat, so I'm gonna hit the sack, all right? I'd like to talk to this committee. I'd love to sit there in my doctor's wife sensible flats and pearls, and tell them what a cheating liar my husband is. Well, I mean, who knows Jason Hest better than his wife? Where did you get this? Isn't that you and Paula? Yes, but look, I... I can explain. I knew those would be the first words out of your mouth. All right, this is crazy. Caller ID is blocked. Somebody's messing with our lives here. I don't care who sent it, Jason. That's not the point. You lied to me about where you were tonight. That is not what happened. This is just like the mess with Jessica last winter. You said you were at a medical conference, when the two of you were off skiing in Vermont. I knew you were having an affair, you son of a bitch! I'll bet she was one of your students. We've spent the last year trying to put our marriage back together, and now this? What the hell is wrong with you? You know, when I first found out about Jessica, I couldn't decide which was worse... the affair, or you lying about it. Casey, this is not... Are you sleeping with Paula now? No. It was a fundraiser. All right? She was being honored. Sid thought we... Sid. Who cares about Sid? Why didn't you just tell me? Why didn't I tell you? Maybe because I'm knew I'd get this kind of a reaction over a non-event. A non-event. Is that the best you can do, call it a non-event? [LAUGHS} I couldn't have said it better myself. That sounds like somebody with something to hide. You know what, I don't want you here tonight. Stay at a hotel, stay with your brother. I don't really care. Really. That's right. Kick his sorry ass to the curb. OK. What are you going to tell Austin? I'll tell him you're away on business. You're gone half the time, anyway. He probably won't even notice. Hey, I wanted to stop by and make sure everything was ready to go. We start demolition in the morning. I don't think I'm up for it, Brent. Is there any way we can reschedule? Casey, what's wrong? You look terrible. I'm so sorry, Casey. God, what else has he been lying about? I feel like such a fool. You thought you loved him. Hey, look, I have a friend at work whose husband was having an affair, too. They drifted apart. They stopped having sex. He claimed that it was because he was stressed out. Truth was, he was just riddled with guilt. It affected her work, her self esteem... everything. And the lies kept piling up. How did she finally find out? She caught him in bed with his business partner. What am I gonna do? And how do I tell Austin? Everything's such a mess. You'll start over like a million other single parents. What's wrong with me? Why did I stay with him? Don't beat yourself up like this. You are a terrific mother, a wonderful writer, and one of the most amazing women I have ever met. Oh. This isn't right. I... I didn't mean for that to happen. I... I need you to go. I'm not going to leave you like this. I'm fine. Just please go? When's Daddy coming home? Hello? Hey. You OK? I've been calling all day. Um, I'm sick to death about what happened. Uh. Austin's been asking for you. I made a horrible mistake. Please forgive me. I... I just... I just want to come home. I don't know what I'm feeling right now. I can't undo what I did. I can't take away the pain that I caused you. But I'm telling you the truth right now. Paula and I are not having an affair. You told me one time when we were in the middle of all that. You said that we had to be completely honest with each other if we were gonna make this work. I'm sorry. I have to go. [SIGHS} Hey. Can we talk? Sure. I can't stop thinking about yesterday. ...Brent, it... it wasn't right. Well, of course it was. You can't deny you have feelings about me. Feelings? Ever since you came over that morning, I... I can't get you out of my mind. Yesterday was... Yesterday was... it was a mistake. It can never happen again. Of course it will. It was just the beginning. Look, you've just been through a horrible time. Your emotions are all over the place. No, no, no. I know exactly how I feel. Brent! You didn't fight me yesterday. You kissed me. Be honest with yourself. There's nothing between us. There'll never be anything between us. I love my husband. But no amount of flowers is going to make up for what he did to you. That's between Jason and me. It's time for you to go. But he doesn't understand you. I mean, he treats you like dirt. He's been lying to you ever since he had that affair with Jessica. He... and his old patterns are coming up again. I mean, just look at Vermont. How did you know about that? Uh, Jason told me. We had drinks the other night. I would never do anything to hurt you. I care about you more than Jason would ever imagine. Please go. You need to leave, Brent. Now. Please, no. Go. How could you do this to me, Casey? I was just trying to save you from that liar. You're the one for me, and you know it. This is Jason. Leave a message. Jason, it's me. Can you call me? I need to talk to you. I'll be home writing the rest of the day. Hey, Ted. Hey. Security camera at the gas station confirmed it was Keller's car. Did you make any headway with the background check? 11 years ago, he was in London, married. And at first it didn't show up on the background check, because it was outside the country. So I dug a little deeper. Did you talk with his ex-wife? Oh, yeah. And did I get an earful. What? Same setup. Keller meets her overseas, whirlwind romance, they settle down. Eight months later, things get weird. He isolated her from her family. She quit her job, stopped seeing her friends. Classic abuser. Exactly. She tried to leave him. He got violent. She finally filed a restraining order and divorced him. But she had to move away anyway, because he kept following her. Should we petition to reopen the case? I think we already have. Casey? Austin? Yeah, Dad? Hey! Listen. I gotta talk to your mom for a few minutes. And then, uh, then maybe you and I can spend some time together. All right? Maybe you can help me on my social studies quiz. Done. OK. Case? Jason. What are you doing home? Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier. There was a emergency at the hospital. Is... is everything OK? I'm not sure. What do you mean? Are you... you seem upset. Did you tell Brent Keller any personal stuff about us? Of course not. Well, he knew about the ski trip with Jessica. Casey, I don't talk about that with anyone. But he said you had drinks the other night? Yeah, we had drinks. And talked about the whole mess with the mayor. And then I think he asked about Paula, and that was it. ...He's asked me about her a couple times now. Why is he so interested in our personal lives? He was here yesterday, and I was really upset about everything was going on. And he tried to comfort me. Comfort you... uh, what... what does that mean? He leaned over and kissed me. Really? I was feeling confused and vulnerable. You were. ...It didn't mean anything, Jason. I don't have feelings for him. I don't know how it happened. Tell him the truth, Casey. You love me. Then today he came back again, and he got really weird when I asked him to go. He's convinced that I should leave you for him. OK. Um, this is crazy. I mean... Your marriage is over, Jason! Why can't you see that? I bet he's the one who sent you that picture. I don't know. I don't know, but all I know is that I got really, really uncomfortable. I don't want him in the house again. Daddy, where are you? You said you'd come and help me. Hey... hey, kiddo, I'll be right there. ...I can see you and Mommy talking. There's no privacy in this house. I mean... god, I hope Austin didn't just hear what I was talking about. I've... I've told him before. Case? Brent's been in this house all along. He's had access to all our stuff. Yeah. And we've had a parade of construction people in and out of here. What are you getting at? Well, I'm just saying, he... he seems to know an awful lot about what's been going on with us. And then... I didn't tell you this. But the other day, he came in the office for a checkup. And he... he said some pretty strange things. He sort of implied that he didn't blame me for Gretchen's death. What? What if he's been watching us? That's impossible, Jason. Really? Is it? I mean, first, we don't know who sent you that picture, right? And now you're telling me that he knew about me and Jessica. What are you looking for? I don't know. No. No. No, no! What is it? No, no, no. I don't know. I mean, it's obviously some kind of camera. Case? He's been spying on us. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! Case. We can't stay here tonight. I'm calling the police. Where's Austin? Dad, my homework. Oh. Yeah. Um, Austin? Your dad and I want you to go get your jacket on, OK? We're going to go out. Like on a trip? Uh, yeah. You know, like on a little sleepover. Oh, great. Breakers. I'll get 'em. Go get dressed, OK? Hurry up. Come on. I'll call the police. All right. Do. No power. Uh, OK. Let me, uh, I'll grab the flashlight and then get my stuff out in the kitchen. I'll get Austin. OK. Jason? Yeah, everything's OK, honey! Ugh! Aw. I loved her more than anything in the world, and you took her away from me, Jason. You destroyed my marriage. You humiliated me. And nobody does that to me. And now you're going to find out what it feels like to lose your wife, your child, your house. And then we'll be even. Oof! Jason? Is that you? Jason's gone. Mommy, I'm afraid. Let's go. You OK? Casey? I know you're in there. Casey! Stop playing games, Casey, and let me in! I hear you. And I'm starting to get really mad! Oh, god. Casey, open up! I want you to do something very important for me, OK? I mean it! I'm not going away, Casey. Mommy, I'm scared. I know how brave you can be. OK? Come here. I want you to crawl up onto the roof. OK? OK. Come on. Let's go. There you go. It's OK. You can do it. C-A-S, E, Y. OK. When you reach the end, grab onto the rose trellis, and climb down. I want you to run across the street to the Moores', and tell them to call the police. Do you understand me? Mm-hmm. Casey! Casey. You're going to make me do something I don't want to do. I love you. I love you. Hurry. It didn't have to end this way. You could've made it so much easier. I was never angry with you. It was always your husband. Jason never did anything to hurt you. He ruined my marriage. What are you talking about? Gretchen loved you. She turned her back on me. And for what... the likes of Sean? She wasn't having an affair. I had to do it. You didn't. She betrayed me. I loved her so much. Oh, no. But I couldn't let her go away with that guy. But then you came into my life, Casey. I wasn't supposed to fall for you, but everything changed ever since that day you came over. And then you let me down. You pushed me away. You didn't leave me any other choice. Stay away from my family! Ugh! Oh! Jason? Jason? Jason? Jason? Oh-ah! Uh, uh! Uh! Uh. Jason? Oh, Jason. Oh, my god. Look at him now. Your pathetic little husband. I offered you everything. You were the one... the perfect wife, the perfect mother, the perfect companion. But you threw it all away. You did the same thing Gretchen did. You chose someone else over me. No. Oh! Jason? Jason? Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. You're gonna be OK. I think he's lost a lot of blood. Mommy! Austin, come here. Hey, buddy. You're safe, hon. I'm so proud of you. Daddy, what happened to you? I'm gonna be OK, kiddo. You OK? Mrs. Hest? You all right? If I could just stop shaking for a minute. We'd like you to say away from the house for a little while, until our forensics team has a chance to sweep the place. They already found four more cameras. Oh, my god. How are you doing today, sir? Is my wife here? I wouldn't know. I just came on shift. Isn't she beautiful? You need to rest now. Tell Casey that I'm ready to go home. Woo! Go Austin, come on! Yes! Goal! Yes! Great, son. Doo-dah! I knew you were the best. Hey. Miss me? What? What's happening? It was him. He was there. It's all right. Come here. Mom, what's wrong?
