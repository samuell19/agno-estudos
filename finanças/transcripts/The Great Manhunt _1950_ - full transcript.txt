- Hello, New York, this is Arthur J. Buckman reporting from Strelna, Vosnia, Europe. We're making recording right here in the city square, where all eyes are turned towards the balcony of the people's hall. Today, the Prime Minister General Niva inaugurates his election campaign. This election, due in a month's time, is viewed with some reserve by Western observers here. There is, curiously enough, no opposition to general Niva. 99% of the population is expected to return General Niva by writing yes in the space provided. Nobody much is likely to say no. Hullo, things are moving. The cheerleaders are on their toes. I think this is General Niva coming out now. - Have you finished, doctor? - Yes, I've done all I can. Well, it will serve very little purpose. However, I said that I would not refuse any reasonable request. You can have five minutes, time for a cigarette. - Thanks. What do you intend exactly? - You have only to walk out of that door. The view is the same on the other side. Shot while escaping? - No no, a shooting accident. We have to think of the newspapers. - I still believe the truth will come out sooner or later. - Why? Why indeed? Why should it ever come out? He can put out what story he likes in the papers. We regret to announce an unfortunate accident. It's a situation that right from the beginning, I've never been able to adapt myself to. How long ago was it? Two weeks, couldn't have been more. In London. It was a Thursday when the letter came. I came down to breakfast and there it was on the table. The first thing I noticed was the Vosnian stamp, the head of their leader, General Niva, post marked Strelna. I'd never been there and I didn't know anybody there. I wondered who could be writing to me. It was from the International Congress of Science in Strelna informing me that I had been awarded the Kepler gold medal. In respect of your outstanding contribution to medical science. We refer of course, to the new operation for the relief of Portal Hypertension, which bears your name and which has this year brought a fresh hope to those suffering from a disease until now incurable. I may have been flattered. I was certainly surprised. It was quite true that I'd been responsible for the surgical development they referred to. In fact, for four months, I'd been demonstrating the technique to my British colleagues at one of the great London hospitals, where I'd been sent from New York by the Stuyvesant Research Council. - Good morning, Dr. Marlowe. Good morning. - Today's messages. I had not realised that my work had been followed so closely on the continent and Strelna was certainly the last quarter from which I should have expected any such honour, political relations between that country and mine being practically non-existent. By the time I left the hospital that evening, the press were already onto it. - Dr. Marlowe, can you make a short statement? - Dr. Marlowe, can you spare us a moment? - Just a few words. - Have you anything to say? We shan't keep you a moment. I'm sorry, gentlemen. I can't just now. And when I got to the club, I met Burton in the hall. - Hello, Marlowe. So you've got your name and the papers again. Congratulations. Thanks. - You knife wallahs get all the publicity. See you in the bar. Yeah, fine. - Oh, Dr. Marlowe? - Yes. - There's a gentleman called to see you, sir. I put him in the smoking room. Oh, who is it? Foreigner, sir, I didn't quite catch his name. - Dr. Marlowe? - Yes. - May I introduce myself? Yanovik Prada. I'm from the Vosnian Legation. May I offer my congratulations? Thank you. Well, what can I do for you? - It's more a question of what you can do for us. Oh? How's that? - At its session today, the Congress passed the unanimous resolution that you should be invited to Strelna to demonstrate your operation. They would be delighted if you could find it possible to accept. Well, that's very kind of them. When will it be. - This week. - This week? I don't see how I can. - You see, unfortunately, the Congress finishes on Saturday and the presentations will be made the same night. The Minister was so much hoping that you could be there to receive the award. Yes, it's very short notice. - You're the first American to be given it. You would agree it's a remarkable gesture at the present time. If you go, your visit can only help towards a better understanding. I told him I'd think it over and let him know. I might quite easily have decided not to go. I very nearly did. Certainly I would never have gone if I'd listened to Burton. - Well, if you ask me, I wouldn't touch 'em with a barge pole, - not with a barge pole. - I don't know, rather interesting to take a peek at what's going on over there. - We all know that already, a purge. - Why bring politics into this at all? I understand your operation can cure a fairly common condition that used to be hopeless. They only want to learn all about it. And why not? They're human beings, aren't they? - I very much doubt it. Now you take. - Just a minute, just a minute. I'm sure Marlowe doesn't want us to make up his mind for him. If I know anything about him, he's made it up himself already. - Yes, I think I have. You know, medical science used to be international, but look at the position today. It's tragic. Now, here are some people from a very unexpected quarter who opened a window, lift a corner of the curtain and let in a breath of fresh air. Well, I don't feel like slamming the window in their faces. So you're going then? - Yes, after all it's only 48 hours. And I really believed it. Once on my way, I found myself looking forward to a new experience. I was hoping to see something in the country and the people, perhaps get away for an hour on my own. See things for myself. - This is your first visit to our country, I believe? - Yes, yes. I had planned to vacation here in 1939. - But there has been many changes here since then. - We must remember that Dr. Marlowe's visit is entirely nonpolitical. - Thank you, doctor. You know, they tell me that in some parts of the world, musicians are finding it increasingly difficult to compose nonpolitical music. So it's very gratifying to think that a doctor can still perform a nonpolitical operation. - Quite so. Meanwhile, of course, everything will be open to you, Dr. Marlowe. But for convenience sake, Torvas Bender's department has drawn up a carefully planned itinerary for your short stay. 1:30, lunch. - Good. - 2:30, visit of the General Niva Hospital. 3:30, visit to the medical faculty of the university. 4-30, visit to the state orphanage founded in 1947 by General Niva. 6 o'clock, visit to the state opera gala performance in honour of the winners of the Congress awards followed by an informal reception at which the Minister of public services will present the awards. - Dr. John Marlowe. - Dr. Marlowe, it is my privilege to welcome you. And as representative of our Prime Minister, General Niva, We present you with the Kepler Gold Medal in recognition of your outstanding achievements in medical science. - Thank you, sir. - You have conferred a benefit on humanity and we are very grateful that you are willing to share your knowledge by coming here to demonstrate your technique. I understand that this is the first time you have visited us here. - Yes. - I hope it will not be the last. - I hope so. - Pardon, pardon. - Oh, Dr. Marlowe. - Excuse me. - Is it agreeable that I have arranged the demonstration to take place at my clinic? - Oh, of course, anything you like. - Yes. - Then I suggest we drive up there tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. - Fine. - Doctor, I understand you are leaving us - tomorrow afternoon. - Yes. Yes, unfortunately I have no choice in the matter. - I'm afraid you will go home with a horribly antiseptic impression of us. Can I persuade you to join my party on a tour of the more decadent nightlife? - I wish I could, but as you know, I have to wake up early. - Shameful, we're exploiting you. Have a pleasant journey home. - Come again soon. - Thank you. - Bernardo. - Galcon is a most remarkable man. - Yes. - He holds three portfolios, - Three? Oh, he must have his hands full. - Whenever you are ready, I'd be delighted to drive you home. - Thank you very much. Well, it's a beautiful setting. - Yes, I chose it myself. The air has a wonderful property. well, I think you will find the case history entirely appropriate, Dr. Marlowe. - Let's see, how old is the patient? - 53. - 53. - I had him transferred to my own wing. Oh, this is Dr. Poldoi, our anaesthetist. - A privilege. - How do you do? - How is the patient? Mr. Marlowe would like to look at him. - Good morning. - What? He wants to thank you. - You tell him I'm happy to be here to help him. - Don't worry, we'll do all we can to help. - Thank you, nurse. May I see the x-ray plates? - Certainly. - He's undoubtedly got a degree of the nacites, which of course increases the gravity of the condition. 10:45, then? Oh, very well. - This operation, gentlemen, is for portal hypertension and the object is to relieve the hypertension by anastomosing the splenic vein and left renal vein. The operation, as you know, is still experimental. How is he? - He has taken it very well so far. - I usually prefer to make a paramedian incision in these cases. Great care must be taken in handling in view of the danger of post-operative thrombosis. In order to reduce the risk further, heparin is usually given. I think I'm ready now for the anastomosis. How is he? All right? I'm not worried. How's the patient's colour? - Quite good. - Let me have a look at him. I want to see the patient please. Niva! Thank you. Very well. Thank you, nurse. Thank you, gentlemen. I hope you're satisfied, Colonel Galcon. - You're angry. That's only natural. - I expect you to be treated according to elementary civilised standards of behaviour. Obviously, I was mistaken. - It was such a pity you recognised the patient. - Dr. Revo, I'm sorry you yourself to such a gross abuse of confidence. - I accept full responsibility. - I suppose he comes under one of your portfolios. - As a matter of fact, yes, I am Minister of health too. - I'd like a car to take me back immediately. - But Dr. Marlowe, I don't see how you can leave just now. - What? - Not just now. If you think you're going to be. - I diagnose a slight case of concussion. Just a little concussion. Dr. Revo prescribed this. How do you feel? Better? - What happened? You fell. - I was knocked out. - Yes. - What the devil? - Now doctor, we were advised that you should rest for an hour or two. - An hour or two? I've got to catch a plane. - When will General Niva be out of danger? - What's that got to do with it? - 10 days? - About that. - Good. Good. That is what Revo and I said in the cable. - Cable? - Yes, we wired your colleagues in London explaining that you are staying a little longer as a guest of the clinic. - I'll do nothing of the kind. - I know how you feel. And I hate insisting when we are so much in your debt. Doctor, I'm sure you'll have some idea of General Niva's position just now. I know that he's the head of a police state that obviously stops at nothing. - You disapprove, of course. - Well, I'm fairly disillusioned about politics in general, but I do like to see just the hint of a scruple here and there. - I can see you are an old fashioned liberal. As you'll know, this country and General Niva in particular are being subjected to the greatest possible pressure from outside. The survival of this nation depends on the people's faith in Niva. We are only two months away from an election, which has been carefully organised to produce a spontaneous mass demonstration of loyalty to him. - What's that again? - Now you will understand why we could not allow it to be known for a moment that he was desperately ill, and why we cannot allow you to leave just yet. - It's obviously a waste of time to appeal to your sense of honour. - I put my duty first, and my duty is to make sure the secret is kept for the next 10 days. Then we can save newsprint, which is in short supply. By announcing the General's illness, his recovery, and your departure at one in the same time. - I demand to be put in touch with the American Legation. - I'm sorry. - Then I must warn you that I stand on my rights as an American citizen. - Try to make the best of this. Our only wish is that you should be as comfortable as possible. In the meantime, if you would cooperate with Dr. Revo, it may speed the General's recovery and incidentally your own departure. Oh, doctor, if you feel like a little exercise, Andre will be delighted to take you for a walk. - Call. - Tails. - Heads. General Niva's. You know, doctor, amongst other things, you have saved us the trouble of striking a new coin. - That's just my bad luck. - Yes. I'll begin. You know, after a day at the office, it is very refreshing to spend the evening with someone who can never say anything but no. Can't I persuade you to stay after tomorrow? - No. We have such different ideas on persuasion. - Can I ask you a question? - It's a free country. Sorry, it slipped out. - You had Niva's life in your hands. Your knife had only to slip to give a practical expression of your disapproval, or you could simply have refused to continue. And yet you did neither. - I don't confuse myself with providence. - Admirable. - Can I ask you a question? - Well, certainly. - What would you have done if Niva died? - As minister of public services, it is my duty to be prepared against any eventuality. - Then you would have had to forget what you humorously call your election. - If we couldn't afford to announce his illness, how much less could we have afforded to announce his death? - You're not suggesting you could have kept that a secret. - Till after the election had given us a mandate for drastic security measures and we put them into force. - You'd have never gotten away with it. - For two months, why not? We control all means of communication. Everything was allowed for. - Was”? - Oh, would appear, I should say. - And you allowed for me? - Naturally. - What would you have done? - You know, you're rather putting me off my stroke. - You could have hardly kept me here indefinitely. - No, we couldn't have kept you here and we couldn't have let you go. You would have known too much. Well. - Well, it would be very difficult to see more than one solution. An unfortunate accident, shall we say, on the way to the airport or to the plane itself. - You can't expect me to swallow that. - One life against the survival of the whole state. Can you suggest an alternative? - Well, supposing I'd given you my word to say nothing about it. - As a private person, I should be delighted to take it. As a Minister, I dare not. Well? - I don't know. I can't get used to being liquidated over a billiard game. Then let's forget it. After all, we're only amusing ourselves by an exercise in theory which would no doubt have turned out very differently in practise. - I wonder. - It's you to play, or perhaps you would care for a drink? A drink? - Yes. Oh yes, everything's already now. You're going to get the car down below. - Dr. Marlowe? - Yes? - Could you come to Dr. Revo please? - Well, I was just going... - Right away, please. It's very urgent. - What's the matter? - Quickly doctor. - What is it? - The patient. - What happened? - He just collapsed. It looks like pulmonary ombolus. - When was this? - Few minutes ago. Have you given him anything? Some intravenous caramine. - Thrombosis. - Blood clot in the lung. It's always the danger after an operation of this kind. Oxygen. Adrenaline and a long needle. Hurry, Andre, or I'll miss my plane. Quick, you understand? - Hello? Hello? - Telephone? - Telephone. - Hello, American Legation? - Yes. - Oh, American Legation, let me speak to the Minister or someone in the party right away. Who's that speaking? - Dr. Marlowe, Dr. John Marlowe. It's very urgent. Hello? Hello? Operator? Just a moment, please. Just a moment. Just a moment. English? - American. Yes. - You speak English? - Yes. - Tell me how do I get to the American Legation from here? - Yes. No thanks. Thanks very much. Thank you. Taxi! American Legation. - I heard you bud, but you're practically there. It's just a couple blocks down the road. - All right, well take me there anyway. - Okay. You're an American? - Yup. - Me, I live in the States three years. How long are you stayin' here? - Not much longer, I hope. - Hey, what the? - What's going on here? Some kind of riot outside the Legation. This afternoon, students and workers demonstrated outside the British and American Legations shouting protest slogans. Several windows were broken. But detachments of the State Police arrived promptly on the scene and dispersed the rioters with great efficiency. To protect British and US property from similar incidents, the Minister of Public Services instantly ordered armed guards to be placed outside all British and US Legations and consulates throughout the country. That is the end of the news service in English. S Than have a fickle-minded real live boy I. - Miss Robinson? - Yeah? - Can I talk to you a moment? - American? - Yes. I heard you singing in English. You are English, aren't you? -50%. - Oh good, then you can... - Did you like the act? - Yes, I did very much. - Curious, you have quite an intelligent face. - Can I talk to you? - You are talking to me. - Look, I'm... - You don't see many Americans in Strelna anymore. What are you doing here? - Running from the police. - What? - It's true. I need help. My name is Marlowe, I'm a doctor. The police are looking for me now. - The State Police? - They're in the theater. I don't know my way around, I don't know a word of the language. - Do you think I'm mad? - But it's... - Get out of here. I can't help you, please get out. - Just one moment. - I must talk. - I've told you I can't help you, please keep away. What are you doing here? - I'm sorry but I had no choice. Can they understand? - No. - They'd have shot me if they'd have caught me. - What? - They tried once before. - Why, what have you done? - I can't explain now, but if we can get alone. - No, I told you I can't help you. - You can help me very easily, if you will. - First door on the right. Wait for me. - Have you eaten? - No. - A cocoa substitute is all you'll get. - Well, that's fine. Thanks. - What is the way I can help you so easily? - All I have to do is try and contact the American Legation. - Well? - Or the British Legation. Well? - Well I thought that you with your British passport might be an excellent... - But I have no British passport. - I thought you said you were half English. - The wrong half, my mother. - Oh, I assumed. - Why can't you go yourself? 'Cause they're watching out after me. - On the telephone? Tapped. - You said you were a doctor. - Yes, I'm with the Stuyvesant Research Council. - I saw an American doctor once in a movie, he was a surgeon in New York. - As it happens, so am I. - Maybe we saw the same movie. - I tell you I am a doctor. I'm an American citizen. My name is Marlowe, John Marlowe. - Is It? - I don't know, I'm beginning to wonder myself. - At least we have that much in common. - I am telling you the truth. - Lots of people in this city speak two or three languages and make very peculiar livings. Some sell nylons, for example, while others are less ambitious and only sell their best friends. - I'm hanged if I see the connection. - Perhaps the State Police can. Why do they want you so badly? How can I help you if you don't tell me? - You probably wouldn't believe me if I did tell you. - I might. - Well then I think we'd better start from the beginning. Your government invited me here under completely false pretences. It involves General Niva himself, one of his Ministers. - Thank you. That's enough. I was a fool to have helped to the first place. I certainly can't help you anymore. You must go now. At once, please. You might find someone at the Grand Hotel. That's all I can suggest. What will they do if they get you? - Hello, Joe. - How do you do? What was all that about? - You will have to sleep on the sofa. - Changed your mind? - No, I just lost it. - What will your sisters think? - They're not my sisters and they have nothing to think with. - Excuse me. I'll be sleeping on the couch. - You will have to go early in the morning. I hope you realise that. - Yes, yes, of course. - You know, this whole business. - I don't want to hear anymore about it. - It's nothing to do with me and I want to go to bed. Saccharine? We have no sugar. - Oh, yes, please. Thanks. You know, I won't forget what you've done. - You will. - You probably saved my life, not that it's much consolation to you. - I'll think of that in jail. In the morning, I'll try and make the Grand Hotel. You know, it's a curious position to find myself in when you come to think about it. - I don't want to think about it. - My colleagues are expecting me back in England. They haven't any idea where I am. - Perhaps that's fortunate in the circumstances. - Yes, I see what you mean. - What about your family? I have one maiden first cousin in Baltimore. - You're not married then? - No, somehow or other I never got around to it. You never had the time. - Not for marriage. - If you don't mind, I think I'll go to sleep now. - Not at all. No, I think I'll sleep pretty well myself. I'm sure you will. I put two of my sleeping tablets in your cocoa. - What? - There are risks and risks, but some risks I don't take. Good night. - You understand me perfectly, Mr. Theodor. - What? - Why pretend? You're no more American than I am. Your name is Karel Theodor. You're occupied in smuggling foreign currency and you're flying to London tonight. - You must be out of your mind. - Your plane tickets, identity card, 5,000 US dollars. You know the penalty. - Why don't you relax and put that thing down. That's not my wallet. - And that's not your jacket, I suppose? No it isn't. - Highly remarkable. - I left mine behind. I picked that one up in a barber shop yesterday afternoon. - I must say I expected something a little better. After you, please. - What are you going to do? - What I should have had the sense to do last night. - I don't understand this set-up. The trouble with you people here is you live in a miasma of suspicion and distrust. And as usual, the first victim is plain ordinary common sense. You can't even think straight anymore. Give me that, you had no intention of using that anyway. What do I have to do to prove to you what I am, recite to you from Gray's Anatomy or the medical encyclopaedia? Who is that fellow? - Michael, he's in the show. - Oh, of course, I thought I knew his face. He seemed to know mine too. - How could he? - I saw him staring at me. - But he's never seen you before. - I know. - You were right, he's phoning the police. You are the American they're looking for. I'm sorry. - All right. So how do we get out of here? - Not that way. To the other room, I'll show you. - How did he know me? - They showed him a photograph at the theater. - Oh. - Where will you go? - Grand Hotel, I guess. How do we get there? - I can't come with you, I must go back. - You can't do that. They'll question you, they'll know I was with you. - I'll think of something. - My dear girl, you don't understand. It's not as simple as that. Now, you listen to me. I can't explain now, but if you go back in there, whatever you say or do you won't have a chance. Now, come on. - Police? - Yes. - Keep going. - Where to? - Just go. He thinks of everything, - doesn't he? - Who? - Your minister of Public Services, Colonel? - Galcon? - Galcon, yes. - What does he do with it? - Everything. - I'm going back. - You can't. It's too late. - What do you mean? - People started looking at us. - But I didn't want to get mixed up in anything. - We can't argue here. Come on inside and I'll try and explain it. - But I'm not interested. - Just be quiet. - No. - It's true. - But what can we do? - There are two alternatives. - Get out of the country. - How? - Try and get the whole story out. - But there's no time. - The mail will be censored, that's sure. If we could only find someone who's leaving the country. - How can we? - I don't know. Theodor. - What? - Theodor. Where is that? He's flying to London tonight. Remember his ticket? - Why should he help us? - Didn't you say there was a penalty for having foreign currency? - They hang you for it. - Good, then he'd be a pretty worried guy since he lost his coat. Where's his identity card? - Give it to me. - Wait a minute. How far is that? - Quarter of an hour. - We have to sit here till it gets dark outside. - Suppose he's not alone. - Tell him to get rid of whoever's with him. - Any sign of life? - No. - I remember there's a keyring in your right hand pocket. - Well, why not? Well it seems he left in a hurry. - Last night, he didn't sleep here. - Certainly was a worried guy. - What do we do now? - No, don't touch it. - But someone will hear. - Leave it. I have a hunch. - Switched on with the light. - If he doesn't come back, what will happen to our plan? - We're as safe here as any other place. - I don't feel safe anywhere. - Theodor must be a pretty big operator. - What is it? - Lights. Good evening, Mr. Theodor. I think you understand English, since you were intending to fly to London. You were telephoning here just now, weren't you? - Who are you? What are you doing in my apartment? - Mr. Theodor speaks English very well, doesn't he? - Quite a good accent too. - What do you want? - Sit down. Do you recognise this coat? - No. - Are you sure? - Never seen it before in my life. - And this too? - No. - You left it in a barbershop yesterday. Remember? - I did not go to a barber's yesterday. - In fact, he never goes to the barber's. - Contains your identity card and $5,000. - It's a mystery. That's what it is, it's a mystery. - How do you explain it? - If I could explain it, it would no longer be a mystery. - I'm quite certain that you don't want your property sent to the State Police. - Aren't you connected with them? - Not yet. We're prepared to strike a bargain. Do you understand? Blackmail. - If you like. - Now, why couldn't you have said so? You had me worried for a moment. How much? - It's not a question of money. - Oh, please, please. Don't tell me it's the principle of the thing. That always turns out to be so much more expensive. - How much? - All we ask is a slight service from you. - Oh. Would you care for a drink? You must have a drink. I need it. What will you have? You really had me worried. Oh, I take no offence. If I picked up your jacket, I would have done exactly the same. - I believe you. - Yes one must live, that's the way of nature. The survival of the unfittest. My health. Oh. - Here are your tickets. You still want to catch that plane? - The plane? Oh, the plane. Yes, of course. - We haven't much time. - What do you want? - I want you to deliver a letter for me personally in London. - A letter. - That's all. Do you think you could get it through? - Oh, sure, sure, leave it to me. I've got friends everywhere, I know everybody. Just give me back my property and the letter is as good as there. - We'll return it to you when you come back with a receipt for my letter, not before. - He doesn't trust me. I'll give you my word of honour, for what it's worth. Now look here, you can't expect me to wait that long. - Very well, I'll send this to the police tonight with a little letter explaining. - May I ask who you are? - No. - All right. I'm a sportsman. I accept. - You have no choice. - It's another good reason. Where is this letter? - I'll write it. - I'll help you pack. Charming? Excuse me. Help yourself. You are not American. - You heard what he said, no questions. - Is he your boyfriend? He's got excellent taste. - Do you mind? It'll take me twice as long as I have to stop to shudder. - You may not know, but I'm a man of considerable influence in the city. Would you care for some of these? - Not at the price. - I think we've had enough of this little game. I want to read what's in the letter. - It's not loaded. - Nevermind. Doesn't make any difference. I cannot deliver your letter in London. - Why not? - I would have told you before, but I wanted to see what you were up to. All aircraft flying in that direction were grounded this morning for inspection. - I don't believe it. - Ring the airport. Not that I believe that the grounded for inspection. - Well why then? - Yesterday we had demonstrations outside the American Legation, now it is guarded. - What's that got to do with it? - State Police are looking for a man and they keep broadcasting his description. Now I put two and two together, and what do I find? An American who fits the description beautifully and who wants me to smuggle a letter out of the country. And I asked myself why? - Still want to read it? What are you doing? - Mr. Theodor asked to be enlightened. - The American ambassador, London. - Read on, I'll fix you another drink. - Are you mad? I don't know yet. - You think I believe this? - It's front page news anywhere, you'll admit that. - Of course it isn't true. Yesterday morning, at 11:45 to be exact. - I would have heard of it. I've got my contacts. - Outside of the government circles, only three people know of it. - Three? - We three. - Don't bring me into this. -You are in it. Why do you imagine they want me? Because I was the only outsider that knew that General Niva was dead. Now there are three of us. - I know nothing. I tell you I refuse to believe your stupid story. - Do you? Well call the Minister of Public Services and tell him that you are sheltering. Dr. John Marlowe. - Shelter? You broke in here. - I tell you, get out. - Tell that to the Minister. Do you think he'd liquidate one and stop at three? - Just get out of my flat. Look, I'll let you go. I won't say a word to anyone. How is that? I promise you, I'll give you my word. I promise you. - I can believe that, but that's not quite what we have in mind. - I'm beginning to see what you mean. - Good. - He's going to get us out. - Exactly. - I'm not. You think I'm mad? Do you think I'm a lunatic? Get out of my flat. - You mentioned your contacts. - I don't know anyone, get out of my flat. - Why? I don't suppose you've stopped at smuggling currency. - I know nothing. - Make up your mind. - What have I done for this to happen? All because of a stupid haircut. Make up your mind. - I should have to make arrangements. It'll cost money, a lot of money. - I'll chip in $5,000. - It's no time to be funny. I have to go alone. - You can't let him to do that. - Why not? I'm sure he understands that if anything happens to us, we'll make it quite clear that he knows the whole story. Don't you, Mr. Theodor? And come back alone. - Never dealt in murder, my dear, but ever every time I have a haircut now, I shall be thinking of you and you. - He'll never come back. - I think he will. - We were fools to ever let him out of this flat. What am I doing here at all? I didn't ask for this. - I'm awfully, sorry. - I didn't know you. There was no reason for me to help you. Why did [? - Because you're that kind of a person. - But I'm not. I'm not at all, you don't know me either. - You saved my life, that's enough. - Look at the situation I'm in now. - I'll get you out of it somehow. I promise. - You realise that we're trapped, trusting our lives to a man who would sell his own mother? - Are you ready? - Any luck? - Of course. You've cost me a lot of money. There's no time to lose. The transport's at the back. Quick. - Where are you taking us? - To the lake, I'll tell you on the way. Oh, you've cost me a lot of money. - Oh, shut up. - In here, quick. - What's this? - One of my fleet. There's only one way you can ever hope to get clear, across the mountains. - How do we get there? - By cable railway, up from Bilin where I'm sending you. At the top, Sigrist will have you met. - Sigrist, who's that? - One of my boys. During the war, he used to smuggle escaped prisoners, for nothing. Now they smuggle for me, but not for nothing. Get down. He's quite fond of me, that policeman. I fixed a nice scholarship for his little boy. Horrible child. Wait here till I call you. This is Armin. He's taking some barges down the lake. He will see you safely ashore at Bilin in the morning, and as far as the cable railway. Remember, ask for Sigrist. - Sigrist. - My wallet. - Oh. If anything happens to us, I don't have to remind you what'|| happen to you. - I'm not likely to forget. - I think I'll keep your identity card just to establish our business connection. - We need a little money. - Anything else? I'm very glad to have got you off my hands. You've cost me a fortune. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Next time I might have my haircut, make a point of keeping on my jacket. - What's the time? Nearly 10:30. - Imagine, this time last night I was singing Paper Doll. Heaven knows what I should be doing tomorrow night. - I'm going to take you out with me. - Where, to England? - If you like. - I've always wanted to go there. - You've never been there? - No. My mother was always hoping to get there one day. She never did. She used to tell me how beautiful it was. - Where did she come from? - Manchester. - Oh. - Isn't it beautiful? - Manchester? - England. - Oh yes. Yes, of course. Is she still alive, your mother? - No. Your father? - I don't know. - What? - He was a school teacher. They sent him away for what they called political re-education. - That's why you helped me. - Perhaps, I don't know. - I've got a lot to remember. - I'm tired. - Try to sleep. Try this. How's that? All right? - What can I do when I get to England? - Well, I have some connections of sorts. - Somehow I don't think you can have very good music hall connections. - Well, I don't know, I once took out jugglers appendix. - That's about all we have in common, isn't it? - Yes, I suppose it is. - I've got no intention of being a burden to you. - You won't be. - There's another difficulty. - And what's that? - I have no talent. - Well, we'll find something else. Don't worry, America is a big country. - America? - Yes, my job in England's over in a few weeks. - We've covered a lot of ground, haven't we? Police boat. You all right? - Yes. - We shall not be stopped again. Plain sailing until Bilin. Goodnight. I'll wake you up for breakfast. - I'm hungry now. - Well, at least we have that much in common. - No, we're worlds apart. - That's right, worlds apart. - You see anyone? - No. Perhaps Sigrist didn't get the message. - This is no place to wait. Sigrist? - You are from Mr. Theodor? - Yes. - Sigrist. Come in, please. Bartorek and Christian, my colleagues. - So you got here? - Good. - Yes, I suppose - you've been told that... - We don't ask any questions. - And we don't answer any either. - You want to get out, we are being paid to do it. Simple. - Can you? - We'll try. - Have you done any climbing? - Well, not really, no. - And you? - Not for a long time. Have we got to? - The easy ways are always well guarded. That is why we must climb. Sigrist will only take you where you can manage. - This will be higher than you think. - You are willing to take risks? - Of course. - Good. Then you must leave at once. - The frontier runs along there. Here we cannot more go forward. You must go down here and up again. We give away the rope now. What is it? - Soldiers. Back. - Are you all right? - Yes. - Can we rest here a little? - We must climb as long as the light is good. After, we can rest. - I'm all right. I can do it. - Then it's easy. - You're sure? - Of course. - Hold. Hold on. Lisa! Now we must wait for the dark. - How much further is it? - Only a half hour. But more open ground, too exposed. There will be a good moon this night. I go and I have a look. Absolutely quiet. - Lisa, listen to me. Help me with this rope. Follow me along the ledge. - I can't. I can't! - You can. You must. Come on. Back. Get back! Stick your hands up. Up! Turn around. Go on, get going. Wait. Ask him if there was anyone else out there with him. Ask him if he ever wants to see his family again. Good, well tell him he's going to take us across and tell him that if we get caught, he's got to get the first bullet. Understood? Now go on, take us up. Come on. Go on. - That's the frontier where the road runs. Beyond that, we're safe. - What's the hut on the other side? Almost near enough to make a run for it, isn't it? Ask him what his name is. Sorry, Josefi. Niva! - It's not the frontier. He was lying. No, you can still get away. - Please go. - No. - Please. Have you finished, doctor? - Yes. I've done all I can. - Well, it will serve very little purpose. However, I said I would not refuse any reasonable request. You can have five minutes, time for a cigarette. - Thanks. What do you intend exactly? - You have only to walk out of that door. The view is the same on the other side. Shot while escaping? - No, no, a shooting accident. We have to think of the newspapers. - I still believe the truth will come out sooner or later. - Why? Would she live? - Yes. - In the circumstances, it seems rather pointless. - Couldn't you? - No, I know what you're going to ask, doctor. What can I do? She knows too much already. She will know more still. - You can't deceive a whole people indefinitely. - No? That is a crowd in the city square. You know who they are cheering? Yes, General Niva. He acknowledges their emotional welcome. He bows. He waves his hand. Now he retires. Why shouldn't our citizens believe the evidence of their own eyes? - A double. - Naturally. The resemblance is remarkable and the balcony is 10 metres high. They are shouting for him to come out again. I think that answers your question. Doctor. You'll never understand, Marlowe. We are making history here. Nothing stands still. You may think you are marking time, but while you do it, you are only a moving staircase. - Going up or going down? What happened? - You heard the shots. They were fired at General Niva. He was killed instantly in full view of everybody. Except of course it was the wrong man. - No. - What? - It was the right man. As far as they were concerned, it was General Niva they saw killed. That's all they know. - The evidence of their own eyes, didn't I say? Nothing succeeds like success. What a situation. - What'|| happen now? - Anything. At the moment, I didn't know whether I'm a crypto fascist, a liberal humanitarian, or a simple deviationist. Depends whether I still control tomorrow's newspapers. - What about us? - Yes, I still have to deal with you. Doctor, your patient is coming to. I have ordered a stretcher party. They will escort you to the frontier. There is an excellent hospital on the other side. - We can go? What can either of you say? Only that a dead man is a dead man. Please don't think that I'm being in any way whimsical, but if you should happen to hear of a vacant chair for political science anywhere, try to get in touch with me. - That may be a little difficult. - It may be difficult, but I would appreciate the effort. - Fasten your safety belts, please. - We're coming down, let me help you. - Please, I must say something to you before we land. -Yes? - I want you to understand that the only reason that I'm accepting your help is because I do admit that you owe me something. - Yes, I know. - Once I'm fixed up, we part. - We part. - It's better that way. You've admitted that we've nothing in common. - Nothing at all. - It would be humiliating for me and disastrous for you. - Ruinous. - You keep on agreeing with me. -Do I? - You don't mean a word you're saying. - No? - No. - No. - Oh. I think I'm going to be sick.
