He knew and he purposely started a fight with me to undermine me. - But the footage shows that you threw the first punch. - He spit on my face. - Part of being rehabilitated is knowing when not to fight when to walk away. - I know this, but he spit in my face. Spit. - I'm sorry. It's for this reason that your parole is not granted at this point. - But I've been good for years. - Sir, your hearing is over. - Ma'am, please. - The hearing is over. - I've been good for years. - Your hearing is over, sir. - Please. - Come on years. - Years, years. - Look who's on time today. - Hey Tre, we gotta Tre talk real quick, homie. - Hey you good?

Yet you gonna bring it up? - I ain't wanna say nothing, man. This... - You already did. Please don't tell me it was Kane. Of all the fucking scumbags in the city, this the one person you gonna go play with. Are you gonna put me in a situation like this? I can't fucking believe this. Jay, what the fuck?

I could you again. Axel, you're up. - Open your mouth. - What? - I said open your fucking mouth. - My mom told me to be a dentist. I still practice as a kid. I pull my own teeth out. You have a good smile, but I see some cavities. Let me pull those out. - No, no, no. - That's one. It's crap, I hate it. Shut the fuck. - I assume you don't have dental insurance. So I won't charge you this time. I don't blame the guy. If I was him, I wouldn't do shit for a loser like you neither. I should just take you outta your misery myself. - Okay, I'm gonna try, I'm gonna try. I'm gonna make it happen if I don't-- - I'll give you one more chance because I'm nice.

Jason Dyson, I'm detective Kayes. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? - Sure. - Why were you in such a rush to get back here after the fight? - I thought I forgot to lock the door. - Do you have any enemies you can think of or anybody who wanna do this to you? - Nah. - You know, I've been working in the streets for 15 years. Don't bullshit me. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't. You've heard of a name Kane, huh? - No. - Well, we believe he might have been involved with this. - I don't know no Kane. - No. You're telling me when you got arrested three years ago for drunk driving and you got bailed out by an employee of Kane. You're telling me you never heard of that name? - Do I need a lawyer? - Of course you do. Look, I'm just trying to help you. That's all. - I don't need your help. Now if you don't mind excusing me. - Look, if you remember anything, anything at, all right? Get in touch with me. - Yeah. Baby girl. - Dad. - Girl. - Shut the up. - You okay. Baby. - Yo, walk away from the cops. Man, you cost me a lot of fucking dinero. - Please let her go. - We got some business to discuss first. - I swear I can make it up to you, just let her go. - Do you know why I took your little girl? - Why? - 'Cause you proved to me that you don't take me seriously. I told you to throw the fight, but you didn't. You thought I was joking. Do you still think that? - What do you want, man? - Man, you just embarrassed me and cost me money. - I tried. - You didn't try hard enough. You could have convinced Tre to go down, but you didn't. - I'm sorry. - Sorry don't fix shit.
