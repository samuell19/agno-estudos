The Jagat Stone. Passed down by The Enlightener to balance The Spirit Realm... ...and The Human Realm. Legend says that the power it holds... ...could fold the sky and turn the earth upside down. The evil spread by the Dark One... ...has made the Jagat Stone that was supposed to emanate light... ...into a vortex of blind ambition, envy,... ...and greed for those who seek power. Dark and light turned red. The Enlightener took action... ...and chose a noble and virtuous bloodline to guard the Jagat Stone. The Aditya Clan. With their pure heart,... ...the Aditya Clan sought out spirits who possess virtues,... ...and together they carried out the noble task. But malicious creatures remained to lurk and wait for their chance... ...to tear apart Aditya's flesh and seize the Jagat Stone. From that day on,... ...the Aditya Clan accepted their destiny... ...that would last for generations to come... ...as the guardian of the Jagat Stone. Record deal. We're going to get it, Raga! Riza! The record deal! -Hold up. Here. A friend gave me this the other day. What is it? -Look! A rental house. What do you think? It's ugly. -Ugly? Check this out. It's close to a record label office. A record label? -Yes! It's a hot spot for auditioning! Raga. Record label, man. Producer. Record deal. Our golden triangle. Come on. -This is our chance, Raga. Are you in? Hey, answer me. Yes or no? Raga. You haven't talked to your dad, have you? Really, Raga? At this rate,... ...instead of going nowhere,... ...we're going backwards. Okay. I'll talk to my dad after this. If you're not coming home,... ...don't be careless. The windows were wide open. The back door wasn't locked. It all starts small, Raga. Especially responsibility. Yes, dad. Dad, actually..... Please, have a look, gentlemen. These are herbal medicine. If you have a rash,... ...trapped wind, or sore throat,... ...you can try our medicine. Just mix it with tea. You can apply this one for itchy skin. This one can cure trapped wind. Mix it with tea, and drink it before bed, sir. Come on and try. This could be your miracle remedy. You wouldn't be here if it weren't for your father's hard work. You have band practice? Yes, uncle. This afternoon. My strings are fine. -Are you sure? I'm going to talk to dad. Wish me luck, uncle. There you go. I'll put in a good word for you. -You don't have to. I'll hype you up. That way, you can take it easy. Don't worry. I'll talk to him after this. -Hey, relax. Hey. Your uncle and I have to go. Watch over the stall. He can. Of course, he can. Hey. What's your name? Sastro. Sastro, you don't belong here. You hear me? You don't belong here. You. -This is my home! Would you leave willingly, or do I have to force you? Hey, Sastro! Hey, settle down! Easy, easy. All right. You could have handled that, Jaya. But, he asked for you. -Sir! Sir. Pardon me,... ...this is all I have, sir. It's alright. You need it more than I do. Thank you, sir. Take the money once in a while. Your bike is already as old as Raga. You think so? Are we still on tomorrow? -Yes, as usual. Go away! I asked you... ...to watch over the stall for a bit. How would I hand down my business to you? I know dealing with the locals is not easy sometimes. But you should..... -No, dad. I don't want your stall. I don't want to go to some village,... ...sell medicine, be a laughing stock, and be sneered at. Everything here,... ...this house, the medicine. It's your life. Not mine. That is my life, dad. That's what happens when I try living your life. Is this what you've been wanting to tell me since yesterday? It is what I've always wanted to tell you, dad! And today I want to say... ...I'm moving to the city with Bagas and Riza. Not yet. What do you mean? Living alone in the city is a huge responsibility. You are not ready. Do you have any idea what made me not ready? It's you, dad. I will never be ready if I stay here. This is not you. Enough. Tomorrow, I'll get ingredients for the medicine from the city,... ...and then we'll talk. Treat those wounds. Dad. Dad, I'm serious! Dad. Dad! You should tell Raga. Not yet. Sorry, I won't be able to pick you up. I got a job offer. It's out of town. I can go home on my own. Take care, Jaya. It is the only one we couldn't get to move. Every time someone tries to move it,... ...they always fail and end up having an accident! Please help, sir. Please wait outside, sir. Yes, sir. No need to hide your wounds, Dru. You must recover. I can take care of this. Alright? Go inside. Raga. Aditya. Aditya. Raga. Aditya. Raga. Aditya. Aditya. Raga. Dad? Raga. Raga! Dad! Dad. Dad. Don't leave me! Should have stayed quiet. Be strong, Raga. No matter what happened,... ...your father has done a noble deed. I'm so sorry. Hey! No! Hey! Take it off! That's me in my previous life. It seems I couldn't go on without you. Our story ended in our previous life. I've been waiting for so long. Decades. For you. For us. Sukmo asked me to hold myself back. But my wait is over. Now that Sukmo passed away,... ...and you can finally see me. Dru. Uncle, help! I can't sense Master Sukmo's energy. Sukmo passed away, Dru. No! -We've buried him. Dru. That's Genderuwo. We call him Dru. He's been following your father for years. I'm an exorcist. Just like your father. But one thing sets us apart. Here. You and Sukmo are descendants of the Aditya Clan,... ...the greatest generation of exorcists... ...destined to guard the Jagat Stone. The stone that balances the spirit realm and our realm. You are Aditya The Seventh. Pitulungan means help. According to the prophecy,... ...Aditya The Seventh is the strongest descendant... ...of the clan, The Lord of Time and Space. When Sukmo died,... ...all his powers are passed down to you. That's why you tend to experience strange things. Your physical condition, the sightings,..... Why didn't he tell me? Raga! Like it or not, you are Aditya The Seventh. I can help you. No need to hide your wounds, Dru. You must recover. I can take care of this. Raga! -Hello. Yeah? Forgive me, Raga. I know that this is not the right time. But about moving to the city..... I'm in. Great! Let's go tomorrow. Okay. What are you doing? I'm Dru. The Bodyguard of Aditya. With Aditya The Sixth gone,... ...it's my duty and obligation... ...to watch over you. Aditya The Seventh,... ...Pitulungan. Pitu. Must you look like this? Can't you change it? Hey, Pitu! Just leave me alone! You couldn't even protect my dad! Hey, hold on. -I have lots of stuff. Hey, Pitu. Why are you here? Who are you talking to? It's nothing. Did you guys wait long? Yeah. It's hot in here. Alright. Just a second. Aditya. It's alright, sir. Just leave it. Pitu. Pitu. Sir? -Aditya. Aditya? There's no Aditya here. Let's get going, sir. You're the one who wiped out my brothers and sisters. I will kill you! What are you doing? Let my friend go! Run, Raga! Raga, Run! -Help! Run, Raga! -Quickly, run! Someone, help! -Help! Raga, run! -Hurry! Two things are most hunted in the spirit realm. The Jagat Stone... ...and the blood of The Aditya. You must learn to control your power either way. Not for your father's sake. I can help you. I couldn't do anything when Sukmo died. I don't want to repeat the same mistake. Uncle. Where do we go now? Training. Uncle. I had a dream yesterday. A weird one. I met a woman I had never seen before. She told me we were a couple in our previous life. She said she has been waiting for decades to meet me. What does that mean? True Love. She has waited for so long. She's looking for her true love. She won't bother us. Do we need him for training, uncle? Can we just leave him? We can and we can't. But we do need Nonik. She was supposedly Aditya The Third's familiar,... ...but now she's with me. Feel better? Nonik will make sure you're fit for training. But for now, I'll take care of you. Imagine this is our body,... ...and this is our energy. Technically, you can let it overflow. Our power will be multiplied. But then our body would break... ...and vanish. To contain more water,... ...we must make the cup bigger. The first step is to open your spiritual eye. Humans are never born alone. Four other spirits will always come along... ...and take on the human form. They are called Sedulur Papat Limo Pancer. Fight them. Put them in here. Dead in life, alive in death. Rogo Sukmo. Uncle? Our physical body only experience a small fraction. Our body is merely a bullet shell. Body, soul, and spirit. You are now aware of this world's greatest mystery. Something much deeper. This is The Spirit Realm. Devoid of time and space. Only the chosen Aditya... ...could open the time-space portal to the Jagat Stone... ...and restore the order of the universe. You are the chosen descendant of Aditya. Enough. Raga, no. Thank you. For helping me. What should I call you? Kunti. Ti. In the past,... ...did we meet each other? Play it. Okay. I call this one... ...There. The song is about..... -Your mother. I know. I was never far. Since you were born,... ...learning to walk,... ...learning music. Until the moment you came home with bruises... ...from your dad's stall. So,... ...all this time, when I felt like I was being followed,... ...it was you? Yes. It was me. Are you sure? I understand. I've been in your position before. Then, I finally realized,... ...that light and darkness can never be united. Sukmo said that, too, didn't he? I just want the best for Raga. Well,... ...you already know the answer. Look after Raga. Uncle. Where's Kunti? Focus, Raga. Today's training is more difficult. Whatever happens,... ...just follow me, okay? This is The Death Forest. Every year on this day,... ...there's always a new blood sacrifice. It takes the form of a woman. Concentrate. Stop her before there's any bloodshed. Good job. What's so funny? Aren't you an Aditya's bodyguard? You should've helped me, not laugh at me. Now you're asking for my help. You're the one who said you didn't need me. If it were Master Sukmo who's here now,... ...he would be able to finish all of the missions. Well, even though he would bring me along,... ...he would finish them all by himself. That's what an Aditya is. Unlike you! You said you followed him anywhere. -Yes. Of course! Then you must know... ...how he died. My hand was wounded at the time. Your dad asked me to return into the suitcase. Being confined keeps me from knowing... ...what happens outside, until you got me out. Then after letting him die,... ...you can still call yourself an Aditya's bodyguard? You think you deserve being called an Aditya? Answer me! Is there a way for you to stop being Aditya's bodyguard? Is there? Just destroy the bottle. Pitu. Don't worry. You still have me. Yes. I only have you now. If your dad could see you now,... ...he would have been so proud of you. Just as I am proud of you. Ga. You drive. Nonik! Uncle! Master Jaya! Uncle! You're not going home? Master Jaya asked me to take care of you. Yes, but he's not here anymore. How did you get that? It's nothing, I..... I'm sorry, Non. I'm not the only one who lost him. But,... ...you can stay here... ...if you want to. Non. Non? Was that..... -Yes. So, he's still alive? I can sense where his energy is. Do you know where? Whatever has him... ...wants the Jagat Stone. We have to save him. Let's go, Non. The creature who has Master Jaya is much stronger... ...than the one you fought in the Death Forest. You should know. We won't make it alone. Non. Do you know where Kunti is? How did you get here? As long as Nonik knows the energy,... ...she knows where to go. Kunti. I can't. You said you have waited years to meet me. Now you want to leave just like that? Jaya said..... -Kunti. They got uncle. Who? We don't know yet. But, Nonik said there's another energy there. We need your help, Ti. I can't do it without you. Dru. I'm sorry. I need your help to save uncle. Of all the Adityas,... ...you're the only one... ...brave enough to come to my place. To bow. To beg for forgiveness. You can think of me as the weakest Aditya. Or stupid, whatever. Just come with me. We're done here. Uncle might die. I might die as well. Genderuwo! Non? Nonik! Non. Non? Watch out! He is the only Aditya who has ever come here,... ...and apologize to me. What do you want? I failed last time. I must be stronger. I... ...want more power. Are you sure? Your spirit will perish. You will only have one year left. Then,... ...you will vanish. Do you understand? I do. This is not for me. It's for my kin. Very well. As you wish. Where are we? An evil spirit brought us here. Then Raga is in danger. We have to get out of here quickly! Uncle. Uncle. Uncle, wake up! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle? It's okay. That's the way it is. New spell works like that sometimes. It just comes out. You cast one spell, yet another spell came out. But, right now,... ...at least now you can open... ...a mystic portal. Your power is complete. You're officially Aditya The Seventh now. The Lord of Time and Space. Uncle. That means,... ...the prophecy that was written in the Aditya book... ...was right. What is this, uncle? There's another prophecy I want to try. But,... ...you need to open the portal first. Please, Ga,... ...open the portal. Open it! It's from The Hollow! We can never get out of here! But Raga needs us! We can. Combine our powers. So called Pitulungan. Okay, fine. Just so you can feel relieve... ...and can open the portal,... ...I'll tell you a little secret, okay? Your father,... ...Sukmo,... ...died here. Your dad... ...died here. And it's all because he was alone. He didn't teach you anything. Sukmo would never understand what all of this means. So I had to take another way. For the greater good. To prove that I don't need to be an Aditya to be the strongest. I'll change the order of the Spirit and the Human Realm. Without being an Aditya. Open the portal. Open the portal, Ga! Open the portal! Jagat Stone... ...come hither... ...your light... ...shines upon all. Jagat Stone. I beseech you... ...come hither. Look, Raga. This is the Jagat Stone. Look at this. It's the power of the lord of both the Spirit and Human Realm. Be careful. There's a strong energy outside. No. That comes from Dru. Let's see. Let me see your power as an Aditya. Don't hold back. You didn't want to be an Aditya, anyway. Tonight,... ...I will release everything in your body. Raga. Our deal is off. What deal? Tonight,... ...all of you will bear witness,... ...the prophecy in Aditya's book... ...will be re-written. Raga. Don't worry. You're not dead yet. I understand,... ...the fate that runs in our family is not easy. No, dad. That cannot be the reason you never told me anything. Why didn't you? Am I that untrustworthy? I became Aditya The Sixth since I was little. I was trained hard,... ...demanded to carry the weight of the Aditya's fate. I know... ...what it's like to be forced when I wasn't ready. So, I waited. I waited until you're ready to accept the responsibility. Now, look. You've come this far. I am sorry. And I am proud... ...that you can decide your own path now. I'm the one who has to apologize. Because I couldn't talk to you. Hey, one more thing. I want you to keep being Raga. Be strong, Raga. That's enough, uncle. Now we're talking. Raga, wait! Wait! Listen to me. The Hollow made me do this. Enough, uncle. You're all I have. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Raga. Here's your spell,... ...Master Raga. Should it be mine intended, Jagat Stone shall shine. Raga! Raga! Raga! Raga! Raga! Raga. Raga. Raga! First mission? Someone called last night for dad's help. They don't mind if his son comes instead. For all of you,... ...I want to say... ...that from now on,... ...you're no longer bound to me. The path you take should be the one you desire. Not tied by fate,... ...rules,... ...or anything else. Thank you so much, Dru. I... ...pledge my loyalty to you,... ...Master Raga. Pitu. Nonik. I'm from Seduluran Puteh. The elders have waited for you. We have information about Mrs. Aditya. Something big will happen. So? Well,..... You're Aditya The Seventh now. You have Dru and Nonik. I'm not worried about your safety anymore. You don't need me anymore either. I don't want to distract you. I don't want to get in your way, so,... ...I'll go home. Alone. Like before. But it's okay, I'm used to it. -Kunti. Come with me. Hey, Pitu! Pitu. Aditya The Seventh... ...has joined Puteh. And,... ...I've called the Four. The Four Death Slayer of Getih... ...of the four compass points. Let's flood this place with blood. Flood the place with blood? Flood the place with blood!
