Hey, cutie. - How was it, dear? - Fine. And you? How's your book? It's very good. I feel like having a Pina Colada. You want something? No, beautiful. Take some money from my purse. You only have this one thousand pesos bill. - Sure you don't want anything? - Sure. Thanks. See you in a minute. Don't spend it all, OK? Of course not, cutie. This is life! It's worth spending all that time in the office just for these moments. Alfredo Roldan. But everyone calls me Freddy. Jennifer Soler. But everyone calls me Jenny. Pleasure, Jenny. Are you here with your family? - With my mom. - Cool. Where are you from? We live in Merida. But I was born in Mexico City. We moved to Merida when I was very little. Mexico City is a monster. I couldn't live there. No? It doesn't scare me. I'm going to study there. Really? What are you going to study? Law. I got a scholarship. Hey, then we have to celebrate! Buddy! Two Daiquiris, please, with Havana Club. But, I don't drink. What do you mean? A pretty and successful lawyer like you has to drink champagne with her clients. OK. So... cheers for your future. Cheers. It's on me. Buddy, this is for our drinks. - I can't take dollars here. - What do you mean? Can you exchange this? I only have a one thousand pesos bill. Let's do this. We can pay with your bill, give me the change and you can keep my one hundred dollars. Consider it my graduation present to you. Really? I insist, Counselor. OK. Here you go. Thank you. Here. There you go. A heart, for another big heart like yours. - Thanks. - I loved meeting you. But I have to go. - Cheers. - Bye. I can't believe it, Jenny. Money doesn't grow on trees! You can't go around trusting people in life. I'll pay you back, I swear, cutie. Stop calling me "cutie", I hate it. You think I'm a stupid idiot, don't you? No, on the contrary. I'm very proud of you. Really? You're brilliant, and you're going to be a successful lawyer, not an ambulance chaser like me. You will always be my pretty girl. - My Jenny Cavilleri. - Mom! I remember it so well. Your dad took me to see "Love Story" with Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw. And you loved the movie, it became one of your favorites, and then you decided to name me Jenny, like the character. Not everybody is named after a movie character. My dad loved movies, didn't he? Yes, as long as they were free. Who was more handsome, Ryan O'Neal or my dad? Let's just say your dad had personality. My grandpa said he was a two-legged rat. Yes. Your dad and your grandpa never really got along. I would have liked to know him. I can tell you that if I decided not to have any more contact with him was because I thought it was for the best. And it's not like he looked for me all these years, either. His loss. Are you OK? Mom? Yes, don't worry. I think that's enough sun for me today. Shall we? I'm very sorry about your mom's death. Myocardial fractures are more common than people think. All I need is your sign. Miss. Miss? Sign here please, dear. Here. Your mom was a very intelligent woman. She did right in buying our "Eternal Life" program. As of today, you have a bank account with two million pesos. You can use that money with this checkbook, whenever you need it. Would you like to name a beneficiary? Excuse me? Do you have a relative you'd like to name as beneficiary in case, God forbid, something happens to you? No, I don't have any relatives. Mind if I join you? It's a free country, isn't it? Are you alone, or...? No. I'm waiting for a friend. Here's your friend. Thank you, Andrea. Did you know that due to temptresses like you there are sinners like me? Stop pretending. I saw when you took off your ring. Oh, that! Look, my wife and I don't get along anymore. We're like roommates. Hey, Fatso! Put me a really cold beer, this wake is dreary. Here you go. Hey, listen. Why don't we finish this party somewhere else? All I want is to drink one day without anybody bothering me. Excuse me, I didn't intend to... I didn't mean you, dummy. See that creep at the end of the bar? That damn drunk is always bothering me. Shit, here he comes! Please don't leave me alone with him. Hey, beautiful! What are you drinking? Nothing. I'm fine. Order whatever you want, I have lots of money in my fucking wallet. Fatso! Open your best bottle of "shampoo" for the little lady. Maybe you didn't hear, but the lady said she doesn't want anything. Well... You order anything you want, too! - I can tell you're a cool guy. - Thank you. I'll "pee" right back. I'm going to make room for everything we're going to chug and suck. Wouldn't you like to give that creep a lesson? Yes, please. Meet me outside. Let's see? How much is it? That lying drunk, he only has 500 pesos! That's OK, let's go. Wait, there's something else here. This is a gold coin. Better yet, right? - Come on, let's go. - No. Short debts make long friends. This is pure gold. It's easily worth about... - Fifteen thousand pesos. - Really? Give me ten and you can have it. I only have three thousand leftover from my paycheck. Look. Fine, give it to me and you can sell the coin. - But... - Come on. We can go to a motel from here. But you pay half the room. You're going to get off, too. Fuckers, you stole my wallet! He's crazy, run for your life! I'm coming to get you, fucking robber! I know where you live! You have to get another coin, this one is wearing down. I'll never get rid of my lucky coin. How much did we make with the desk jockey? Three thousand pesos. Those shitty lowlifes! Why do they come to a bar if they don't have money? You're shitting me, Barry. It's OK to be a pig, just not so filthy. One of these days they'll shut me down because of you. Here's your share, Fatso. You don't do shit, but you sure collect. Don't spend it all at once, you rascal. We still have to pay the rent. When have I ever let you down, Marichula? "They're off! "Arabela takes the lead followed by Hechicero. "Pie-O-My is in third, "followed by Royal Crown, Sevillana and Princesa Maya. "Hechicero reigns in the second place, but Arabela holds on..." Run, fucking Hechicero, run! "Arabela still leads. "Hechicero and Arabela are at the front! "Coming to the final bend, Arabela gains on Hechicero. "Hechicero tries, but Arabela overtakes him "and Arabela is the winner, folks!" Shit! Where are you going in such a hurry, fucking Barry? You look great, Uncle Chencho. The good life, right? How have you been? Like shit! I have stones in my bladder. When I piss it feels like I'm having twins. You're not doing so hot either. I saw you at the races. I got bad info and bet on the wrong combination. Were you leaving without paying me? No way, Uncle! I was going to the ATM for your cash. The ATM is right there. Yeah, but that's not my bank. And you know the commissions they charge for using those. Thieves! You mean you can't pay a thirty pesos commission? Besides the principal bet, you owe me for the football match and Canelo's fight. I will pay you every last cent, Uncle. Really? What's more, so you see that I'm a serious man. What the hell do you want me to do with this? It's a gold Cartier, Uncle! I can think of something better. - Surprise. - No! Meet my stepson. Remember that Polish dancer I was screwing? He's her son. They call him the Hyena of Bialystok. - Gouge his eye out. - Which one, Uncle? The left eye, or the right eye? - Surprise me. - No, no surprises! Give me a couple of days, I swear I'll pay you every last cent. I'll give you a week. If you don't pay, my dick pain will feel like a caress compared to what I'll do to you. FATSO'S BAR - Good morning. - Hello. I'm looking for Bartolome Ramirez. Never heard of him. This is him. You're fucking with me? This is Dirty Barry? What happened to him? This was like 70 pounds ago! - Dirty Barry? - Yes, Bartolome. In the hood we call him Dirty Barry. Look, girl. I don't know what Barry did to you, but I have nothing to do with him. No, you're not getting it. It's a family matter. I'm his daughter. I'll be damned! I didn't know Barry had a daughter. So you need to see him? Those earrings you're wearing, - are they gold? - Yes. - Hand them over. - What do you mean? You want me to lead you to Dirty Barry? Darling. Look. See what I bought you. How pretty. Try them on. Look. Barry moves around between places. Lately he's been staying at a pension here, downtown. The Balboa's Pension. BALBOA'S PENSION Coming, damn it! Yes? Bartolome Ramirez? How did you find me, girl? The super let me in. Tell that asshole that I didn't call for any services. Shit! They hire them younger and younger these days. Look, I'm Jennifer Soler. I'm Regina Soler's daughter. You're... You're my dad. Come in. Fucking shit! When did I get this worn out? Is your water good? I could offer you something else, but all I have is whisky. Do you want some whisky? Do you? No, water is fine. Excuse me, but I'm going to pour myself a shot. So, your name is Jennifer? Yes, but everybody calls me Jenny. To what do I owe the honor of your visit, Jenny? Mom died. We were on vacation in Cancun, and she had a heart attack at the hotel. The doctor said she didn't suffer. What the fuck is going on here? Who is this filthy girl? Let me explain. I'll drag your little whore out of here, you son of a bitch! Let me introduce Jenny to you. My daughter. What daughter? Since when do you have a daughter? Since... How old are you? - Nineteen. - Nineteen. - May I have a word with you? - Yes, of course, dear. Are you crazy, what's wrong with you? - Listen to me. - No! You listen to me! How do you know if this brat isn't lying to get something out of you? There are too many details to explain right now. You have to trust me! OK. Fine. But if I find out that this is one of your tricks, - I'll cut your balls off. - Yes, dear. With this nail clipper. What grade are you in, Jenny? Junior high? No. I'm going to start university. Really? What are you going to study? I want to be a lawyer like Mom. A "lawyer-gangster". Gimme five. - Are you going to study in M♪rida? - No. Here. I got a scholarship. What about the house? My mom was renting, so there's no problem. - Hand me a napkin. - Listen. Can I ask you something? How did you meet my Mom? Regina... Regina was my lawyer. She defended me in some matters that turned sour, and then the poor little angel inevitably fell victim of my irresistible personality. So, we fell in love, we moved in together. But your grandfather, that damn phlegm-eyes, hated me! He really hated me. He finally convinced her that I was a bad influence, and eventually, we slowly drifted apart. But I always wanted to get back together with you two. - Always. - Why didn't you? Because he threatened me. He said he'd put me in jail if I contacted you. By the way, how is the old fucker phlegm-eyes? - He died. - Heavens. He had a temper, but he was a great guy. A great guy. "Happy Birthday, we hope you celebrate many more!" Hurray, hurray, hurray! The birthday boy, the birthday boy, hurray! One, two, three! Dad, you drooled all over the cake. Leave me alone, stop treating me like a kid. Can I offer you anything else? Three neapolitan puddings and a glass of anise with a coffee bean. - Thank you, dear. - You're welcome. I'll "pee" right back. Young man, young man! Your wallet, young man. You dropped it. Oh, my. Thank you so much. I don't lose my head because it's stuck on. It's good to lose it once in a while. Allow me to thank you in some way. - No, forget it. - Don't say that. It's no big deal. - Is it your birthday? - Yes. - Fifty. - Fifty! - Congratulations, grandpa! - Thanks. - I lost track. - You lost track. I'd like to treat you to something. - No, no. - Please. Some tequila. Go ahead, Dad. Miss! - Yes, sir? - Three special tequilas for the adults and three sodas for the kids. On my tab, of course. It'll be a pleasure. Right away. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's time to go. - What about dessert? - Now! Why? I hope you live to be 100, grandpa. I wish! - Take care of him. - Yes, we will. - Let's cheer. - What a great guy! I'm sorry, miss. My cousins insist on paying my bill. The check is arranged! - Thank you! - Thanks! - Cheers! - Thank you! Perfect. Thank you, sir. Thank you, doll. Nothing better than a big meal to celebrate this beautiful get-together. And this is where the Three Musketeers go their separate ways. - What? - I really liked meeting you, Jenny. And I'm so sorry about your mom. Come visit me when you feel like it. Just let me know ahead of time so I can clean the house. OK? Nice meeting you. Me too. Hey, come to bed. I'm not sleepy. - What's wrong? - I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm tired of rolling around, hustling, eating, sleeping, fucking. All those things. I don't get tired. Because you can get anything you want with that face. Even another man. But I'm here, with you. You're still thinking about that girl, right? Forget her. You're not a saint, you can't go around picking up a brat you hardly know. I'm not saying I'm a saint, you know exactly who I am. Even if you're not a saint you have to believe in something, right? Tell me... Who's the boss, Barry? I don't know. God... or the Devil? All I know is that you're hotter than either of them. "Lady Condesa is running hard, "but Angel de Acero sprints like a true comet." Run, Lady Condesa, don't fail me! No! "Angel de Acero wins, Lady Condesa is second and Tiny Dancer in third. "That's it, folks!" What's up? - Your friend, the bartender, said you'd be here. - In exchange for what? My High School graduation ring. That damn Fatso has a big mouth. So, what do you want? I wanted to see you again, and I thought I could help you. What makes you think I need help? When were you born? You don't remember? March 27th. What day of the week? Saturday. - Two thousand on this trifecta. - Yes, sir. - It's all I have left. - Here you go. Good luck. What's a trifecta? A trifecta is a bet where you predict the first, second and third places in a race. Do you have a strategy, or is it by chance? I don't do anything by chance. I have my method. You were born on March 27, a Saturday. I added 2 plus 7, that equals 9. So I bet first place on horse 9. March is the third month. I bet second on horse three. And Saturday is the sixth day of the week, so I bet third place on horse six. Technically, Saturday is the seventh day, Sunday is the first. You're a smartass. No. If you don't want to talk to me, just say so. Sometimes it's best to think about something else so I don't jinx an important bet. - We won! We won, Barry! - We won! We won! Let's bet on the next race, come on. Sir, you're in luck. Two consecutive trifectas. Thanks a lot, buddy. Thank you. Smile. Time to leave, this place is full of crooks. - How much did you get? - Not a lot. But you won. Thanks to who? You're welcome. Things weren't exactly like that. At least admit that I brought you luck. Well, I admit you had some part. Here's your share. Where are we going now? I can take you to where you're staying. But... I want to stay at your place. That's too complicated. Marisela won't like that one bit. You're going to leave me alone again? Are we family or not? I know. Let's toss a coin. If it's heads, forget about staying at my place. If it's tails, you can stay a few days. But that's all. OK? OK. Tough luck. Come visit next week and tell me how you're doing. Hey. Stop it! That's my good luck coin. Yes, and it's a trick coin. We can toss it again, if you want. No. All right. After all, you're not a bad luck charm. Get up. - What time is it? - Late. So, you two get out and hustle, the fridge is empty. The world belongs to the shrewd, Jenny. It's a jungle out here. Watch. Buddy, bet another hundred, you might win two hundred. Join in, lady. - Where is the ball? - Here. You won again! The guy who won is in on it. All the bystanders are. Their job is to attract victims and talk them into playing. Easy. - Come on, lady! - See? Look at it. It's the lucky ball, everybody wins. Here it is again. Look, lady. I'm gonna mix it up and ask you now, where is the ball? Give me the hundred pesos. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I won't let you down. Take out another hundred. Now he has to talk her into betting double or nothing until he swipes her clean. Get even, come on! You can win two hundred to buy chicken. It's so expensive now! She really doesn't know any better? It's human nature. Naivety and greed are a hustler's best weapons. Why do they call you "Dirty Barry"? Because of that old movie? It's a classic. Not precisely. But your mom said I looked like Clint Eastwood. So, this is your trade. - What do you mean? - Stealing. Listen to me, girl. I've never stolen a thing in my life. Thieves use violence, people give me their money voluntarily. There's a huge difference. - Hey, Chafafas! - Hey, Barry. - Is it ready? - You bet, champ. Great! Being a hustler requires glibness, charisma, seeming trustworthy. In one word, being a good actor. The best hustlers feed on the clients' guilty feelings. - Clients? That's how you call them? - Why not? You look like a million dollars! Now, you're going to see a true professional at work. No, don't worry. I'll be there in half an hour. Get the presentation ready... No! My phone! You're just going to walk away? Sorry, I'm in a hurry. And what am I going to do? All my work contacts are on this phone. I'm sorry, but it wasn't my fault. It wasn't your fault? Should I call a police officer and let him decide? Relax, don't get upset. Then what? Oh, no! What am I going to do? Just look at this. How much did it cost? Like... six thousand pesos. What? It's not an iPhone! Well, could you give me half? Thank you so much. You're a great man. That's what I call talent! - So? - Let me see. - It fits you perfectly. - Doesn't it? 100 thousand for a coat made of drapes? This is much more than drapes, don't be foolish. I swear you'll have it, my sweet Marichula. Some day. Do you think maybe I could join your team and help steal from people? I told you we don't steal. Besides, you don't have what it takes. You need to be bold and have a cold head in case you're discovered. You don't even know me. Let's see. Go on, surprise me. All right. Who would you choose? There. That's my client. - What's she going to do? - I haven't the slightest idea. They need you in the back. - Yes? - Go ahead. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Sorry, this is embarrassing. I bought this purse a little while ago, but my mom told me not to spend money on nonsense. I need to return it. I paid in cash. Let me see. All right. Just a moment. Well done! Like father, like daughter. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome, bye. So, you doubted I could? What did I do wrong? You have talent, I can't deny it. But that was easy. Let's see if you've got what it takes to join our team. Good afternoon, miss. What can I do for you? Good afternoon. I'm looking for a diamond that could be mounted on this ring. Do you have an idea of the cost? Yes, I want a small one. It's for my aunt. Of course, it'll be a pleasure. - Teddy bear, I love you! - I love you more. Look! These are .25 karats. Each one costs 15 thousand pesos. Over here we have finer stones, and more expensive, of course. These are beautiful. Oh, teddy bear, a ring?! Really? - This one. - Show it to her, please. - Certainly, sir. - Come here, I'm going to eat you up! Wow. It's like the Kardashians'. - How much is it? - It's on sale, sir. - 250 thousand pesos. - And you say it's on sale? - Yes, sir. - Is that the final price? How much is love worth to you, sir? Exactly. Thank you, we'll buy it some other time. What?! We'll come back later, love. Of course. You never have money for me, only for your whores! No pumpkin, please don't make a scene. What scene? This isn't a scene! Don't, pumpkin. Pumpkin! Don't leave me! Pumpkin, pumpkin! -Please, pumpkin, -Don't call me pumpkin, you son of a bitch! How embarrassing. We apologize, miss. Sometimes we get clients that are a bit different. Did you like any of the diamonds? I think I'll have to discuss it with my family. They're very pretty, thank you so much. Thank you, have an excellent day. You too. This stone is well worth a slap. I'm sorry, teddy bear. I took my role a bit too seriously, right? What'll happen when they realize it's missing? Will they fire her? Lesson number 1 in this profession is not feeling sorry for the clients. Besides, you wanted in, didn't you? Yes, but you always say that this isn't stealing. And what we did today is basically stealing. Haven't you heard of blood diamonds? The ones mined by poor little African boys? - Yes, but... - Come on, it's not a big deal. This profession is not black and white, there are scales of gray. A toast to Jenny, who just graduated as a scoundrel. To Jenny and her stripper name! Sorry, but Jenny is a stripper name. For your information, I was named after Ali MacGraw. The star of "Love Story". It was my mom's favorite movie. That's a lie. Your mom's favorite movie was "Selena". When I met her, she was obsessed with Jennifer Lopez. - That's why she named you that. - For JLo? I was named Jennifer after JLo? Your mom acted like she was high class, but deep down she had the same vulgar tastes I did. I'll pee right back. Order the check, will you? It's going to be just like last time, right? What? You think we never pay? We'd be in jail by now. Can I ask you something? How did you meet? Barry and you. Luck is smiling at you these days, isn't it? What are you talking about, you damn Pole? Did you think we wouldn't find out that you won at the races? I had a good day. What's the problem? The Uncle is pissed because you didn't pay him. Now you owe him triple interests. Triple?! Fuck me! Are you paying, or not? I left my wallet at home. Well, that's too bad. What attracted you to him? What? You mean physically? No, forget that. Well, before I met Barry I did a lot of stupid shit. The worst one was moving in with a creep who beat me if I didn't take money home every day. And the only way to do that was stealing from the idiots who hit on me at the bar. One day, I thought I was going to rob the biggest idiot of them all, but he caught me. Instead of getting mad, he offered me all his money for me to walk out on the creep who beat me. That idiot was your father. Don't you mind helping him swindle people? It's a bit like what you did before. Look, girl. Barry does what many so-called respectable people and companies do. Do you think these damn plastic glasses really cost 5 thousand pesos? Barry does the same thing. Yes, he robs you, but looking at your eyes. And he never loses class. Are you going to stop fucking around? That's what I asked your mother! Stop screwing around, and give me your car keys. That'll be like an advance for Uncle. Sure. Believe it or not, Barry has his own ethical code. He would never use violence on any of his clients. Laugh, you son of your polish bitch! Laugh! Still, I don't kid myself making plans with him. After all, the only god that a man like Barry worships is money. Enough! Stop it, stop! Enough! Tell Uncle that next week I'll pay every last penny. - What's wrong? - What happened? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. The guy who cleans the bathroom got upset because I didn't tip him. BALBOA'S PENSION That hurts! Don't be a crybaby. Just look at your hand. How much do you owe? Too much. I can sell my jewels, you can sell your car... I told you it's too much! The drugstore was closed, but a girl downstairs sold me this sanitizer. Let's go to the liquor store. You arranged everything, didn't you? I don't want any trouble. Perfect. Perfect, buddy. Thanks for everything. You're ravishing, cupcake! Who were you talking to? Fatso. He confirmed the hotel. It'll be fine, darling. The best part is I'll be able to pay my debts. Why the mystery? Where are we going? We're going to Puerto Vallarta. OK. How's my Jenny doing? Did you fill it up? Did you check the car before leaving? Of course! Who do you take me for? This is the end of the line. Come on, move it! Barry. You're leaving your car on the road, Just like that? Lesson number 2: never look back. Besides, it's not good to get too attached to material things. So, what? We're going to walk until we see the sea? This week is the National Bankers' Convention. The city will be bursting with wealthy jerks. They'll be in boring conferences in the mornings and then they'll hit the casinos where they will spend a fortune. That's where we come in. We're going to catch a big fat fish. I'm going to need help from the two of you. Come on. Let's get off. - Thanks, buddies! - Bye! Good luck with the strike! The united people...! Will never be defeated! Bye. How much will this cost us? - Rednecks. You rented a suite? How much are you spending on this, you rascal? A bundle. But don't you worry. If you spend everything, where's the profit? Lesson number 3: you have to spend money in order to make more money. - They're unbelievable. - Aren't they? Show me your hands. Oh, no! We have to do something about these nails. They're as ugly as your dad's. That's our big fish. Cesar Larranaga. Fatso says he's in charge of handling accounts at one of the biggest banks in the country. An impeccable family man. But he's also a pervert. Addicted to gambling and alcohol. Besides, he likes them young. The younger, the better. You're going to be the bait. We'll catch him in a compromising situation, to blackmail him claiming you're underage. You're going to leave me alone with that creep? Don't worry. We're using the cousin routine. One good cousin, and one hot cousin. What if he calls the police? Believe me. He'll rather pay us before risking a scandal. "A heart, for another big heart like yours." "You think I'm a stupid idiot, don't you?" "No, on the contrary. "I'm proud of you. "You will always be my pretty girl." "I love you, honey." "I love you too." Hey, brother. Bring us two chilled caipirinhas. And tell the barman not to be greedy with the rum. Look. I might tip you with one of these. What's up, Jenny? Why the long face? Come on, cutie. "-They say I'm a scoundrel..." - Move your body. Jenny! Jenny! What's wrong, daughter? I'm sorry if I did something to upset you, but I have no experience being a dad. It's not that. I've been thinking a lot about Mom on this trip. I wonder what she'd think if she saw me. Don't get me wrong. I know you're the way you are, and that's all right. But I'm not sure I want to be like you. Listen to me, Jenny. I'm only going to say this once. These days, these past few days have been incredible. You're becoming a very important part of my team. But I can't make you do anything you don't want to. So, if this is the end of the road you can go back to Mexico City, no hard feelings. Thanks for understanding, Dad. I love you a lot. You know? I love you too, a lot. What are you thinking, rascal? You've been like this for hours. Jenny will come back, you'll see. I'm not so sure this time. Yes! Go ahead, beautiful. Remember everything I taught you. Sorry, may I ask you for some advice? Excuse me? May I ask you for advice to learn how to win? I can tell you're experienced. The only advice I can give you is to always listen to your heart. That's excellent advice, sir. Don't be so formal. You're making me feel old. - No. - Excuse me. Whisky, please. Would you like anything? - Cuba libre with tequila. - Cuba libre is with rum. That's it. Can you show me an ID? Yes... I think I left it... - No problem, she's with me. - Yes, sir. Thank you. How old are you, sweetie? Don't tell anyone, but... I'm not 18 yet. You don't say. Who did you say you're traveling with, doll? My cousin. We won an Avon sales prize. They even gave us a suite. Why don't we toast to doing what our heart tells us? Good idea. Sorry. Allow me, allow me. I thought chivalry was dead. Why don't we go back to the casino so you can continue teaching me? Why don't I teach you the game we all play? Finally I find you, baby cousin! - This is... - Ruby. Selena's cousin. Selena, you didn't say you had such a beautiful cousin! You're so kind, handsome! What will it be, beautiful? A Paloma. Palomas for everybody! Yes sir! What were you talking about? About matters of the heart. Is your heart as big as Selena's? It's so big I can't keep it inside! I can tell. Enough, enough! You girls are still dressed. Take it off, take it off! Why don't we make a toast? Forget the damn toast! I think you girls are just teases who heat the water but don't take the leap. No, no way. What's more, help me Ruby. - Show me! - Let's change the music, don't we? Whatever. That's what I'm talking about, shit yeah! Wait. Now, come on. Come, come. Come here, little Selena. Get over here! Give me a kiss. I'm starving, aren't you? Yes, I am. Room service? Could you bring up a platter of cheese and cold cuts? And a bottle of your finest champagne, please. Thank you, good night. Come here already. Don't be so stubborn, Selena. I think it's time to liven up this party, don't you? What are those? Funny pills, to help us relax. Come on. Didn't you want to have a good time? I'm taking cough medicine. It's fine, you can take these too. No. No. Well... if no one wants to have a good time, I don't know what the hell we're doing here! Wait. I do. You're kinky, aren't you? We were supposed to take one each. I wanna make a toast. To you, beautiful angels. It feels like I died and went to heaven. You want some water? Ruby, you need water? Are you OK? What's wrong? Are you OK? What did you give her? The dealer said they were to set the mood. Call a doctor! Hurry! What are you waiting for? Call a doctor now! Marisela... - Who is it!? - Good evening. Room service. No, thanks. We don't need it anymore. Don't mind me, I'll leave the champagne in the cooler and leave. My goodness! What happened here? Is she all right? No. - I need to call hotel security. - Wait, wait. Let's all calm down. Calm down? This woman has no pulse! And I had nothing to do with that! This idiot gave Marisela some pills! Wasn't her name Ruby? - I'm sorry, I have to call security. - Wait! You look like a reasonable man. I think we can come to an agreement. Here. Take this money and don't tell anybody anything. Sir, we have to do this the right way. With a clear head. My cousin is a cop, and I think he can help you. But he won't do it for this kind of money. How much are we talking about? You have a dead woman and a minor in your room. That won't be cheap. Money isn't a problem. How much? Like... two million. Fine. Marisela isn't breathing, and you want money? Please calm down, miss! Don't tell me to calm down! This is getting out of hand! Do you know each other? No! I've never seen her! I swear, never! You know what? I think you should call security. What are you waiting for? You want me to call them? And you, slut! Stop playing dead! I'm no fool. - Get up! - Who are you calling a slut? - You. - You son of a bitch! Get out! And don't tell anyone! We know where you live. Are you OK? Yeah. You had foam in your mouth. I sucked an Alka-Seltzer. I thought we were supposed to do the underage scam. I decided to turn it up a notch. For it to work, your reaction had to be real. And we almost had him, damn it! He was going to pay, but you screwed up everything! Please calm down. Do you know what we lost there? All that planning, and it all went to shit! Dad, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You're sorry. Great. That solves everything. All the money I spent on this trip doesn't matter. We are fucking broke! But it's my fault, you know. For trying to teach you this way of life. You're a stupid brat who can't do anything without her mommy. Leave her alone. Jenny made her best effort. I can't pay for this suite with her best effort. Or the food you ate. Much less the fancy clothes. You only care about money. You think there's more to life? Love? Forgiveness? All that bullshit they sell us, is only possible with a big, fat wallet. And after you have it, someone shows up and takes advantage of you. Why am I even trying? You don't get it. I get why my mom didn't want to be near you. - Where do you think you're going? - I've had enough! I'm sick of you and your scams! You're leaving me here with all the burden? What more do you want? You want money? Tell me exactly how much you spent. I'll pay you for everything. What's that? Unlike you, Mom thought of me and my future. She left me money so I could get ahead in life. How much? Tell me how much I owe you. You don't owe me anything, Jenny. Jenny, it was nice meeting you. But we both knew this was not going to work. You have your whole life ahead of you, and I... I have to keep going, the only way I know how. Good luck, daughter. Barry is right. It's the best for all of us. The scholarship only covers 70% of your tuition. And the check you gave us, bounced. That's impossible. Go on, check with your bank. Next. Thanks. Indeed, miss. Your account is empty. Last Friday a check was cashed in branch 327, Puerto Vallarta, for the amount of two million pesos. That's your signature, isn't it? Like I told you, miss. Mr. Bartolome paid his debt and left, I don't know where. Is it OK if I look around? Sure, go ahead. "That's our big fish. Cesar Larranaga." LARRANAGA NOUGAT Here's everything I owe you. Including interest. Let's see, put it here. Fine. Satisfied? Last time I was satisfied, I was 30. I fucked every day, and I could piss like a horse. Ah, the good old days! Well, pleasure doing business with you, Uncle. Wait, we still have an issue. Is there a problem? No, I don't have a problem. In fact, I really like you. It's my wanker of a stepson. How's it going, Hyena? I get if you're a little mad, but it comes with the job. That's what I said. But he's not listening. You want me to apologize? Fine, I went too far. Buddies? Wait, no, stop, no. Stop! You motherfucking piece of shit! Here. The number to a friend, he's a really good veterinarian. See if he can fix your foot. What can I get you, pretty girl? Cuba Libre with Tequila, please. Here's your Cuba Libre, kid. You want me to stay? You're a great actress. They should give you an Oscar. You need to take better care of these nails. They're not fitting for such a beautiful girl like you. If you're here for your money, I'm sorry to say there's none left. I paid my debts and the rest went to these assholes. What happened to your foot? Nothing. Life happened, it crushes you as soon as you turn your back. Why are you here? I need to understand why you did it. What's to understand? I needed the money or I'd end up in a ditch. How did you know I had it? You don't have to be a genius. You showed up at my house to tell me your mom died. Knowing Regina, it was obvious she left you something. I didn't even have to look so hard. You had all the insurance papers in your bag. You ripped the check in my face. That's the oldest trick in the book, kid! You used it yourself with the diamond. So, it was all about the money? If it's any comfort, for a moment there I thought the plan had gone to hell. But I finally fell for it, right? They all fall. It's human nature. Everyone can say no and get out in time. But just like you did, they all come back. With hope of getting something that only exists in their mind. I won't feel sorry for you, Jenny. That's Lesson Number 1. And I'll tell you now another lesson, the most important one. Don't trust anyone. Not even your own father. You think you're so smart. You keep talking about human nature like you're some kind of expert. But the fact is you don't know a damn thing, you don't get it. If you'd asked me for the money, I would have given it to you. I would have done anything for you. Anything. I couldn't risk it. Goodbye, Barry Goodbye... daughter. What? You're already in pajamas. Aren't we going to the graduate party? Sorry, Carla. I need to pass my exams or I'll lose my scholarship. Fine, but... I need you to give me the rent, please. You'll have it tomorrow. OK. Sure you don't wanna come? Come on, I'll wait for you to get ready. No, don't worry. You go have fun. OK, braniac. Don't fry your brain. Well done, miss. As always. May I sit here? How'd you find me? You know, Fatso said you were here. That damn big-mouth. What did you gave him? I had to give him Marichula's fancy coat. - For real, what are you doing here? - Nothing... I wanted to see you. I thought I could help you. What makes you think I need your help? I am in debt with you and I'm going to pay you every last penny. And how do you plan on doing it? With trick coins? No, I thought I'd save up... I'm not interested! That would take you a lifetime. Besides, someone told me once not to trust anyone, not even my own father. And that someone forgot to tell you the last lesson about this trade ♪ Even the worst scoundrel deserves a second chance. Fine, Barry. You will pay me. But this time, it's going to be my way. Whatever you say. You see that Chinese man over there, betting a fortune? Of course. What's the plan? LESSONS FOR SCOUNDRELS
