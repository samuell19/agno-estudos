Can I ask you a few questions, Penelope? - Yes? - Yeah. Excellent. A nurse? Saving her from what? This is not your house? So where is your house? Where did you live? How did you die? Penelope, if you can remember something, I'd like to hear it. Okay, okay. That's enough. Your name was never Thomas. You know that. All right. We're done here. Thanks. We're done. We're not doing this anymore, okay? Relax. Keep your eyes open. Now, try and remember. What do you want for dinner? I get to pick? Yes, you do. Anything. Hmm. Let's see. Come here. Daddy and I love you so, so much. You know that, right? You keep saying that. What's your special wish for today? Can I stay up late? Okay. How late? As late as you want. - 10:00? - Yup. Yeah! Go. I'm tired. Yeah. You wanna go take a lie-down? Come up here. Whoa. Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. Guide me through the starry night. And keep me safe till morning's light. God will always take care of you. Are you cold? No, the red one. Red one? Okay. Here you go. Go see Dad, just not too fast. Oh. Isn't that beautiful? All right, everyone, now, hear His love. Come on. Any of you guys ever seen a jellyfish? What if I told you that there was this variety of jellyfish which doesn't age like you and me do. In fact... In fact what? This jellyfish will never die. At least not due to old age. And when it gets old or sick, it reverses its life cycle, essentially becoming a baby again. Scientists nicknamed it the "Immortal Jellyfish." God does some strange things. Is that your rocket, sweetie? Yeah? You just keep looking at it. Look at the lines, and just draw what you see. Okay, look at me. Okay. You call your folks? No. I'm not gonna tell them. Tell them what? Nothing, sweetie. What's your special wish for today? Do you have any ideas? You have any fun ideas? I'm gonna draw Sally. For her headaches... These little ones every four hours. The big ones are for her tummy. Little for pain. Big for nausea. Okay? Okay? Mom, this is a child's dose? I may be retired, but I think I still know my stuff. And you don't need to write anything down. I will come by every day after dinner and see how things are going. And you call me if anything comes up, okay? Can I see her before I go? Please? Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. How come you're still awake? I'm going to the moon. Oh, yeah? It's my first time ever. Oh, really? Wow. Uh-oh. What's up? I pooped my MAG. You don't wear diapers anymore. My MAG. You sure? 'Cause I don't smell anything. My MAG. Your MAG? What is a MAG? My Maximum Absorbency Garment. What did you say? My Maximum Absorbency Garment. Hey, honey. Okay, let's go to bed. You, too. Me and Sandy started playing dress-up. She was Alice, I was Mad Hatter. I don't imagine that... That's something Jan I would do. I wanted to be the Cheshire Cat, but... She didn't want me to. I think my smile kinda creeped her out, you know. Thanks, Mitch. I got more. If you need 'em. I know you do. Darryl, God knows, I've always looked up to you. You're a good man. You got a great wife. You guys are gonna get through this. You wanna go for a jump? No, you go ahead. Breakfast. You didn't hear me? No, I guess not. I'm just going to finish up my lesson plan for the sub here. I'll be right out. Okay. - You're not hungry, sweetie? - No. Do you want something else to eat? Abby? You just wanna play, don't you? Yeah. How about you show Daddy what it's like to lift off. Okay? Five, four, three, two, one. Okay, now, show Daddy what it's like to land on the moon. I don't know. You don't know? No. Sure you do. Hey... Do you want some waffles? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Come on. Show me how to land on the moon. I never did. You never did? No. Well, how come? The fire. Hon, we're out of eggs. Can you run by Mitchell's? The fire? We never had a fire, sweetie. The fire when we go to the moon. Who's going to the moon? Apollo's going to the moon. Darryl? Yeah, anything else? Uh, coffee filters. Sally, catch. Wow! Be a dog, Mom. Yay! Sorry, bud. Come here. Attack... Of the Tickle Monster. I wish we were dogs in real life. How come? The dogs are never sad. Well, dogs get sad sometimes, just like people. Are you sad, sweetheart? No, you are. How are you, Heather? I'm doing okay. I... I heard about Abigail. Hi, Darryl. Hey, Gerry. Excuse me. On us. That's okay. Thanks, Gerry, but... Come 'round back with me. I got some goodies for your girl. - Thanks, Heather. - No problem. Thanks, babe. What is that? Gerry just gave 'em to me. Hey, where's Abs? Abs, come see what I got. Shh. She's resting. I thought her and I could go set them off at Mesachie later. What do you say? I mean... You could come, too, I guess... Oh, can I? Oh. - Thank you. - Yeah. And you can pretend you're having a good time. It's okay. Mom said she needs to be in bed by 7:00, actually, so... Maybe tomorrow, during the day. Fireworks kind of have to be at night. She should sleep. Why? What's that? Come see. Fireworks. - Yay! - Yeah! Take a look. Pilot to control, testing. One, two, three, testing. Pilot to control. They can't hear you, Eddie. We can't talk across the Cape and we're supposed to go to the moon? Good God. Control, we got fire. Can you reach that? We got a bad fire. Eddie! We got a fire. We got a fire. We're burning up in here. Get out! Get out! We got a fire! Get out! I'm burning... Back soon, sweetie. Hey... You excited? Are you sleepy? Okay. Remember, we're not gonna tell Mommy about this. 'Cause she would say, "You're supposed to be in bed." I don't want her to be upset with us. All right? So this can just be our little treat. Okay? Okay? Good. All right. All systems check. Liftoff in T minus 10 seconds. You count us down, Captain Abs. I'm Commander Jones. Commander Jones? Okay. Then can you count us down, Commander Jones? Ten, nine, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Oh! Feel like some yummy waffles? No. You got to eat a little, okay? - Abby. - All right. "Commander Jones." You're not hungry? Good. Strawberries, waffles and whipped cream. You want a special rocket delivery? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. Here we go. Special rocket delivery for Commander Jones. Who's Commander Jones? New nickname. So how were the fireworks? Awesome. I smelled it on her. I was gonna tell you, but... You looked so cozy sleeping there last night. She really should sleep. She loved it. You should've seen her face. Well, now she's got a cold. I'm sorry. Okay. There you go, baby. Hi, Jan. Thank you. Can Abby play? I'm sorry. She's... Resting right now. - Okay. - Okay. God bless. Thank you. - Darryl? - Yeah. She's... Taking a nap. Can we talk? Sure. I know it's just fireworks. But we have to talk. Now. More than ever, right? Right. I know it's just fireworks... I wanna feel something different. Was I really that bad? Hon... I wanna tell you something. Okay. I think Abby had a past life. What? And she was an astronaut... In a past life. She told me. She told you? Sort of. When we were out shooting off fireworks the other night, she told me her old name. Are you serious? I've never seen her so sure of something. She told you her... Old name? Yeah. And she told me she was on Apollo 1, and there was a fire. And I checked it out, and there really was a fire. How would she know something like that? Abby said that? Exactly like that? Not exactly like that, no. Honey, it's in her brain now. Okay? Dr. Hart said she would act differently. Apollo 1 was the first mission to the moon. It caught fire on launch, killed everybody onboard. One of the astronauts was named Edward R. Jones. Why would she say her name is Commander Jones? "Jones"? Jones is her preschool teacher. Last week, she told me that she was a butterfly. Little kids say stuff. Not stuff like this. So you believe this? That our daughter is an astronaut? Why? Why now? With everything that's going on... "Why now?" Don't you see? If this is true, then it means Abby won't actually be dead. If she lived before, then it means that she will live again. Oh, no. Everything's fine. Um... Just wondering if you could come over and look after her for a bit? Thanks. - Jan. - Hi. - Darryl. - Hi, John. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice, Pastor. Oh, anytime, anytime. Darryl, uh... ...needs to speak to you. Right this way. "Because Jonah the whale "was different, he often felt left out. "Like that day, when he was playing..." Am I gonna die? Everyone gets to die, sweetheart. Am I gonna die soon? Do you know where you go when you die? Where's that? Houston. You mean Heaven. One day, we'll all get to go to Heaven. See Grandpa John, be together again. Mmm? Sweet little angel face. Boop. Boop, boop. Boop, boop. It's not uncommon to feel lost at a time like yours. Remember. Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not into thine own understanding. Darryl? When a time like this arrives in life, a time of great uncertainty... You must realize that God has you in His hand to overcome your fears and doubts... Apollo's going to the moon. We can't talk across the Cape and we're supposed to go the moon? The fire when we go to the moon. We got a bad fire. ...so that you can see the truth. Does that make sense, Darryl? Thank you. I'll go warm up the car. We've gotta do what's right for Abby now. Right? Right. Sorry to call so late. I'm looking for a Dr. Fisher. If you could... Never mind, I'm sorry. Hey. I'm gonna go check on her. What's so funny? Look at all these pies. Maybe pie will fix everything. - Yes, hello. - Hi. Hi. I was hoping to speak to Dr. Fisher, but I was... Dr. Fisher is no longer here. I know. I know. But I really need to speak to him. Well... I'll let you know if he calls. Wait. My daughter's been saying very strange things. Okay. Next month's open, if you'd like to make an appointment. I don't have next month. She's very sick. How sick? Terminal sick. I'm... I'm so sorry to hear about your daughter. Why don't you give me your number, and I'll pass it along. Thank you. - Morning. - Morning. This looks great. - You're up early. - I had a bit of a bad dream. I'll see if she's up. I'm not hungry. Are you... Hungry for a waffle plane? Have some juice then. Get the telephone. Hello? This is Dr. David Fisher. Yeah. Hi. Thank you for calling me back. Yeah. How can I help you? Who is it? Now is not... It's not the best time. You don't really have much time, do you? Right. Uh... It's my daughter... I don't feel good. You don't feel good, sweetheart? No. Okay. Where don't you feel good? Your head or your tummy? - Tummy. - Your tummy? Is it all ouchy, or is it yucky? - Ouchy. - Ouchy. Darryl? We're gonna go lay down. Okay. Come here. Hello? Yeah, I'm here. You'll need a pen. And then me. I like this little scarf guy. I gotta go out. Huh, what? Where are you going? Gonna go see Mitch. How come? See you soon. - Darryl... - I'll be right back. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. You gonna boop Daddy? Bye. Bye. - Hey, Sandy, is Mitch there? - Yeah, sure. - Darryl, is everything okay? - Yeah. Hey, can I borrow your truck? - Hey, buddy. - Hey. You want some kiwi lemonade or something? No. Uh... Can I borrow the truck? What's wrong with the Cutlass? Jan might need it. Okay, where are you going? I gotta go out of town. Where out of town? Out of town, out of town. You're acting really weird right now, Darryl. - What's going on? - Nothing. All right, I'm sorry, can I borrow your truck? I'll have it back in five or six hours max. Darryl, you can borrow my truck, but you gotta tell me where you're going first. Okay. Okay, well, she probably just saw it on TV or something. No, we supervise her. Well, then anywhere. From... From Jan? No. - What about you? - No. Okay, or in a book? She's four. She said there was a fire. There was. She told me her old name. And she said she pooped her MAG. Mitch, she pooped her MAG. Yeah, she could have heard that anywhere. Where, at Sunday school? There's a doctor in Vancouver who specializes in things like this. Things like... What kind of things? Are you actually thinking about... I'm going to see him. Go to see him? Darryl, you need to just go see your little girl. That's why I'm doing this. What do you mean? This guy, Fisher, he says he has proof. Proof... Proof that I can see her again. Oh, man. Man. What if he does, Mitch? What if he has proof? Do you hear yourself right now? He says... Abby knows where she'll be reborn. Yeah. In Heaven. Darryl, that's where you're gonna see her again. Well, I can't wait that long. Now, can I have the truck? - Just be back soon. - Okay, I'll be back soon. - Go Birds. - Go Birds. Thanks. And who do you think lives in that little cave right there? Trolls. Trolls? I think you're right. Hey, what's your special wish for today? - Roll it. - Roll it. Pat it. - Mark it with a "B." - Mark it with a "B." Put it in the oven for baby and me. * Twinkle, twinkle little star * How I wonder what you are * Up above the world so high * Like a diamond in the sky * Twinkle, twinkle little star * How I wonder what you are * Then the traveler in the dark * Thanks you for your tiny spark * He can't see which way to go * If you didn't twinkle so * Twinkle, twinkle little star * How I wonder what you are - You made it. - Yeah. Dr. Fisher? - Darryl Eckford? - Yeah. Come in, you're late. Sorry, it took longer than I thought it was going to. That's okay. It's fine. Dr. Fisher... On the phone, you said you could help us. Yeah, you've got questions about the afterlife. I guess I want to know what happens when Abby passes on. Oh, she'll pass on. At least the Abby that you know. So what part of her won't? Soul? It's as good a word as any. - Do you believe people... - I don't believe, no. You just said... When you interview over 2,000 kids from all over, who can remember exactly how they died, who can remember the names of relatives that they've never met before... When a three-year-old boy who won't stop saying "Pippin," leads you to a backyard, 300 miles away, a backyard that he's never been to before, and he points to the ground and you dig up a tin and inside are the 50-year-old mummified remains of a pet bunny, and on the collar it says, "Pippin"... Believing seems redundant, doesn't it? It's like believing in gravity. Or believing in birthday cake. He's in there somewhere. Who? The Pippin boy. In here? It's my life's work in that box. Videos? Yeah, interviews. Back when I had tenure. You play squash? No, I'm here about my daughter. Yeah, this is about your daughter. Come on. What do you mean, "squash"? It's research. You said you wanted proof, you came all this way. How could you possibly have proof? Said the Bible thumper. Where's that big teacher of yours? At Mitch's. Watching football? What's wrong? "What's wrong?" What isn't wrong? Sweetie... It's nothing. I know what "nothing" means. He's been acting strange. Stranger than his usual strange? Honey, everyone's sky gets clouded from time to time. Remember what your dad always said, "God is smiling. Smile back." I wonder if Dad would say that now. Of course he would. Couldn't slap the smile off that man's face. Ear-to-ear, even on his deathbed. That was morphine, Mom. Hello? Hey, honey, it's me. Where are you? Uh... Seeing a specialist for Abs. How's she doing? A specialist? We've... We've seen the specialists. Look, can we talk about this later? I'm with the guy right now. You were with Mitch. Yeah, it was sort of a last-minute decision. What are you doing, Darryl? I'll be home early, I promise. Before church. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. I gotta go. Um... Give Abs a kiss for me. Love you. Ta-da! I finished. What do you think? I thought she'd like the colors. I can make something different, it's not a problem, I'll just... He's not with Mitch. Where is he? Would you like a soak? Come on, have a soak. Come on. Let's take off your shoes. Roll up your trousers. What exactly are we doing here? I need to get back. I'll tell you something, Darryl, your daughter is a rare case. For a child to be remembering while dying, - you're very lucky. - "Lucky"? Very. How do you suppose I'm lucky? The young can see the past. The dying young can see the future. "See the future"? Right? It's all about light. I hope this stuff still works. Give me a... Give me a six. All right. Give me a seven. Okay, again, seven. Eight. Work, damn it! Okay, nine. It's not firing. Nine. Nine! Ah! - Ah! My eye. - Jesus. I'm so sorry. Here, let me see it. Let's put some water on it. What is that? Ow! Ow! It's Russia's finest. I'm sorry. I drink too much. At least it'll be disinfected. Here. Here, just... An astronaut? Ha! That's a new one. I just can't. With Abby, and now Darryl... I don't know what to do. You don't do anything. You take care of the Lord's little angel. We will look out for Darryl. He said he'd be back for church tomorrow. And he will be. He will be. That stuff you said about dying, and seeing the future... You really believe that? Do you want my help, Darryl? I still don't know what it is you do. I have a camera. A special camera. I'll bring it by. A camera? It's frontal lobe photography. It's basically an EEG hooked up to a penetrating light, which activates the pineal gland. It's all captured on good old silver nitrate. Taking photographs of what? Whatever's gonna come next. Look... My career is in the pits and, as I said, your daughter is a rare case. I'll call you in a couple days. Your daughter doesn't have a couple of days, Darryl. It's now or never. I just need to go in there and just get a couple of shots. I have to talk to my wife. This could be the chance you need to see your kid again. I'll call you. All right. I'll see you around. You should probably put some ice on that, too. Knock, knock. Thanks for coming. Oh! Jeez, you spooked me. Is everything all right? Darryl thinks Abigail is an astronaut. An astronaut? Jan needs our help. What... What do you want me to do? Morning, Mitchell. I'm just pulling your leg. I heard you had his truck. Hi, Bill. Sorry I'm rushing to get back... G.D., what happened to you? You good, Darryl? Yeah, I'm fine, Bill. I'm fine. Smells like the hard stuff. I know it's been tough for you and Jan... I don't drink, Bill, you know that. Well, something's been drinking. Yeah, that was a spill. Uh-huh. And the shiner? Squash. Squash, yeah. I was at a squash court. You were playing squash? That's right, Bill. I gotta go. How'd you like to let me give you a lift into town, Darryl? No, I'm fine, Bill. I'm... Really, I'm fine. I can't just let you just drive on out of here like this. Ava told me about your difficulties. What do you mean, "difficulties"? I won't give you a ticket or nothing... I'm not drunk, Bill! Where's Dad? He'll be here soon. Okay, if you start to feel bad, we can leave, okay? Here, take your swallow pills. No. Abby, please. They hurt my throat. Ava said it was bad. It's okay. Just where you left off. Hi, sweetie. What happened to your eye? My eye? It's nothing, you should see the other guy. I can explain. - Bill pulled me over. - Not now. Dear Lord, thank you for this food which is laid before us. Let us use it to nourish our bodies, and thee to nourish our souls. In Jesus' name, Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Okay. Look, Mom. This is good. Did Barbara bring it? Could I pour you some tea? Yes. Yes? Okay. Or do you want to pour the tea? - Me. - Okay. Can I come play with you guys? What do you think? Can Daddy play with us? Okay. The dog... You should stay on the couch. I'll sleep right here. I'm sleeping here. So I'll sleep in our room. Hey... - Hey. - Morning, Darryl. Where's my truck? Oh! Darn it, Mitch... - Where is it? - It's, uh... It's still in the lot at BKV. It's in the BKV lot? I know, I'm sorry. Darryl, I need my truck for work, you know that. I know, let me grab my keys, Mitch. Don't bother, okay? I went and I picked it up already. You did? I'm here to talk some sense into you. All this spaceship stuff... Then you go out and you get a DUI in my girl? I wasn't drinking. It doesn't matter, just grab your trunks. What do they think? It's stuff I don't wanna say and you don't wanna hear. But you show up late to church, you're leaking of booze, you look like you just got into a fight. People talk... You don't think that. Darryl, I don't... I don't know what I think anymore. Look, I know you and Jan are going through a lot. But we all are. You know, don't go making it any harder. Come on, let's go for a jump. - No, you go ahead. - No, you're coming. It'll fix you up. Let's do it. You really get that from playing squash? Kinda, yeah. Should've just said I walked into a door. Yeah, that or a cannonball. Whoo! Yeah! That'll fix you up! There you go. You okay? I can't feel it, Mom. It doesn't hurt. No? Good girl. You're so tough. Hey, sweetheart. Come on. Here it comes. Drip, drip. There we go. I'm home. Don't let him big-dog you now. How was Mesachie? It was cold. I got something for Abs. I thought we could give it to her together. Are you kidding me? What? What are you doing? - Well, Abby loves space, so... - What are you doing, Darryl? Abby loves space, so I got this for her. No, you got it for you. Will Abby like this? Jan? Jan. Will Abby like this? - Yes. - That's what's important. Whoo! So we'll leave in an hour? I was thinking, um... I should stay home today. She's in no shape to go. Go where? Um, church, hon. You have to, Darryl. After what happened there, I don't feel comfortable. Besides, this is our business. Family business. They're our family, too. Family don't judge each other. Oh, so now it's you who knows about family. Is that Sally, babe? It's really good. It's a terrible thing. It's a terrible thing. Bless you. Bless you. Look at your faces, you're all so beautiful. How's things? Okay. How's Darryl? Where is the guy? He's doing better. He's looking after Abby. I knew a jump would fix him up. Lots of people. Welcome, everyone. It's good to see you here today. Get the door. Say cheese. Who are they? Colleagues. You spoke on the phone. You didn't say anything about bringing other people. It's just a precaution to ensure everything runs smoothly. We gather here today, oh, heavenly Father, to pray for a very special girl and her family, who is in all our hearts, your young and beautiful Abigail Eckford. We lower our heads to you as our Lord and Savior. We lower our heads to you in trust that you will accept one of our own, little Abigail, into your holy kingdom. We ask that your blessing be placed on her mother, Jan, and that you give her the strength to persevere. And with your infinite mercy, we pray for her father, Darryl, who is going through unimaginable pain. We do not judge him, heavenly Father. When God embraces Abigail with his arms, we pray that Jan and Darryl... I'm sorry. Okay, sweetie, we've got to put this on your head, okay? We pray for Jan and Darryl, that they will find comfort in their daughter's passing, knowing that this is not the end of Abigail Eckford, simply a new beginning. For it is in Jesus' name we pray. Amen. Amen. Daddy, it hurts. Ow! - Stop it. - Take it off! - Turn it off. - Darryl, no. Turn it off! It's almost... Jan. Jan, listen, I can explain everything. Hi, baby, come here. We just need a few more minutes. We're almost... Get out! It's okay, sweetie. It's okay... Leave, Fisher! Sweetie... No, just go. Just go. Please, just go. It's okay, baby. - Jan... - Please just leave. I can explain. I'm calling your uncle. Don't. Okay. You're okay. Fisher! You lied to me. - It was almost done. - You hurt my daughter. I will pray for you both. Yeah. Yeah, you do that. You think I'm going to hurt her? Ava, I'll go. But first I need you to say that you'll tell Jan something. I'm not going to tell her a G.D. thing. They deserve peace. Listen, Ava? Ava. I need you tell Jan to ask Abby if she saw anything. Could you please move your foot? You tell her. Go home, Sal. Sally, go home. What was that all about, can you tell me? Well, all I know is that William has the kettle on and we're going to stay the night, okay? Try and get some rest, dear. Mom... Is Darryl okay? You might think that God is sad. But you know what? God is smiling. Smile back. Room for one, please. Sorry, no dogs. Well, what am I supposed to do? She's got nowhere to go. This is a dog-free motel. I love dogs, but... Do you think you could make an exception, just this one time? Sorry. No dogs. Stay there, Sal. Room for one, please. Where's your dog? I gave her away. You gave it away? That's right. Is non-smoking all right? Hey, honey? That him? Am I in Hell, Sally? Darryl, she won't talk to you. - Ava... - No Darryl, listen to me. You talk to God. He's all ears. Ava, don't hang up. Bless you. Where's Dad? He's out. Out where? You miss him? God will always take care of you. What does God look like? God? Like you. And me. And Daddy. Darryl, open up. I know you're in there. Look, the photos didn't turn out. I'm... There's still a few kinks. We got a little. Maybe. Take care, Darryl. I'll see you next time. Think big. How's she doing? It's about time for her next dose. Did he say where he was going? - Darryl? - Yes. Just walked off with the dog. Did he say anything? Anything at all? Well, just... Something about Abigail and whether or not she saw something when that contraption was on her head, I mean... God... If you're there... Please help me. - Hello? - Mitch? Hey, hey, I need one more favor from you. What? If we're friends, at all, then you'll come pick me up at the Robin Hood Motel... Why'd you do it? I don't even understand you... Mitch, I gotta go home. I'm sorry. Mitch, please, I need to go see... I'm sorry, Darryl. Mitch... - Goodbye. - Mitch? Sal, let's go. I said, no dogs. Yeah, um... I found her in the dumpster. I guess that jerk that I gave her to didn't want her. So, I got to check out since this is a no-dog motel. Yeah, no dogs. Is that your green car out there? Yeah. Hey, I took your keys. I was going to steal your car, and the dog slept in the room last night. I'm sorry. I'm an astronaut, Mama. What's the astronaut's special wish for today? Come see me. See you where? At my house. Your house? Where's your house? Houston. Houston? What color is your house in Houston? Yellow. Yellow? - Are you sure? - Uh-huh. And what else is at your house in Houston? Mommy and Daddy and you. And my rocket ship. Hey! Sal, come on. - Thanks, Mitch. - Get in. You're a good friend, Mitch. All right. Twinkle, twinkle Little star What happens when a star stops shining? When a star goes out? There's a big burst of light that continues on and on forever and ever. So, really, the star never goes out. Same with the light in here, it goes on and on forever and ever. - This is as far as you get. - Thanks, Mitch. Hey, Mitch. You're a good Christian and you're a good friend. Go Birds. Come on. Go Birds. Please don't say anything. I just... Need to be here, okay? Jan, are you okay? I'm oka... I'm okay, Mom. How is she? A little loopy, but no pain. Jan... I'm so sorry about everything. You know, she... She told me things. Things that she saw. What'd she say? Sweet pea? She's okay, Ava. What did Abby see? She said she saw... Me and you... Together. That's good. I like this one.
