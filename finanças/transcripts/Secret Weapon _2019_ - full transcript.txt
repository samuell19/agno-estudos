Ermakov, get out! Now, face the wall. So, can I give you a hug now? Aren't you afraid... to hug the enemy of the people? Oh, go to hell! There is a task for you. We don't have people. We lost many. The rest are at the front, or you know where. These are reliable people. When do we have to be ready, sir? In two days at the most. And the captain? Knocked down a rank. The party card? What kind of mortar gun is it? It's a top-secret project. A powerful launching unit on the load-carrying vehicle. Made at the Communist International factory. The first salvo was on July 14th, near Rudnia. The area of destruction is huge. How did it get there? Oh, you'll find out soon. I admit I'm guilty. I'm ready to be punished. Sergeant! Take the convict away now. Hands behind your back. Dismissed. Wait a second, soldier. Yes? Can you show us the place where you left the launching unit? I could find it with my eyes closed. Galiyev. An NKVD High School student. The officers' pentathlon- swimming, running, shooting, grenade throwing, horseback riding. The leader of the group. He has initiative. At the moment, his detachment is the most effective one. Belous. Moscow Institute of Physical Culture graduate. Combat sambo master of sports. His teacher was Spiridonov himself. Second place at the All-Soviet competitions in 1937. Knysh. Boxing master of sports. He has the most endurance. Instant reaction; a strong puncher with both hands. Ivanov! Belous, go on! Very good! Altynov. A skier and a hunter. Has a great sense of direction in the woods. A winner of the military land navigation army competitions. Subbotina. She's an archery master of sports. She's also a university student majoring in law. Which one can use a radio? Everyone has been trained. I will need an interpreter, too. May I come in? Yes. Are you Ermakov? That's right. Anna Reiner. I'm your interpreter. Fall in! The password for recognition is "100." I will explain. For example, I name a figure of 30, and you must answer with another figure which adds up to 100. So, is that clear? Reiner? Seventy. - Knysh. - One. It's 99. Come on, jump now! - Repack it. - Yes, sir. Tighten this strap. Right dress! Attention! Group, here's the operation order. "The 'Agate' group, consisting of eight people, the commander of the group being State Security Captain Ermakov..." - Yeah. - "...has an objective to be air landed behind enemy lines, in the grid 23/14. Then to move to the area of the village Vyselki... to locate the BM-13 launching unit, and to destroy it by means of demolition, or in some other possible manner. After completing the main task, the aforementioned group is not to return back. The group is to stay behind the enemy lines. Major General Sukhotin." At ease. At ease. Is everything clear? Yes, sir. Get ready, everyone. Get ready, everyone! Here! All right, go ahead now! Let's go! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Seventy. - Thirty - Are you OK? I'm fine. Are the others with you? Knysh and Altynov are looking for P.D.M.M. Listen to me. We need to walk five kilometers through the woods to get to the mortar gun. Rally point is three kilometers away. When we jumped out, the wind settled in south-west, so... second group drifted to grid five. Forty! - Rouslan, it's me! - Answer by the rules. Forty. - It's 60. - Come here and help. - The other one? - No. Who? Siavris. - Alive? - I think he's OK. - Siavris, get your knife. - What for? To cut your shrouds. Come on, cut the shrouds. The Germans are coming! Come on, take him down! Let's go! Siavris, hurry up! Cut it! Hurry up! My arm! What? Are you OK? I don't know! I don't know! - All right, go. I'll cover you. - OK. Get up. Hold it, Belous! Here. We can't go into action. We won't make it out alive if we do. I'll lead them away. Go. Go now. Let's go. The first rally point is here. - Knysh. - Aye! Stay and wait for the group. Subbotina and Altynov, follow me. Yes, sir. And I said, "Go!", but the animal didn't move an inch. It's 99. Drop your weapon! - Drop your weapon! - Easy, easy, easy, buddy! Easy! - Drop your weapon, now! - Easy. Stay put. Stop it! Hey, stop it, guys! Hey, I'm a friend! What are you doing, you guys? I'm Russian! Hey! I'm not the enemy or a policeman! I'm... I'm a recon scout... from Moscow! Air landed last night! You hear that? He tells a new fairy-tale. But it's true! It's true! You can look! It's inside my collar! Gnat, hold on a second. Check it out. Give that to me. How many of you recon guys landed here, huh? Quite a few. Why the hustle, then? - What do you mean? - Why did they send you here? I don't know. I swear I don't. We were to be told after we landed. It could be true. OK, so that's why this duffel bag is stuffed with food, concentrates, butter, anything you need. OK, buddy. You're going with us now. - Ninety. - Ten. Are there two of you? Two and a half. Can you walk? Yes, sir. I rested a bit, sir. Comrade Captain, I beg to report. Go ahead. Reiner. Looks like she was killed. Here. This is the place, Comrade Commander. There, look! The brushwood is scattered. Maybe you mixed something up? They towed it with the APC. There's only one way here. To the village of Vyselki. Let's go straight through the woods. Come on! So? What happened, then? Two salvos near Rudnia. So powerful - wails, bangs, columns of fire. All hell broke loose. And then we were forced to retreat, right after the mechanized corps. After that they churned up the earth, and so we got stuck. And we found ourselves encircled. We had to take out the mortar guns. So we went ahead. Mine was the last one left. Suddenly, the "Messers" came flying. The Boche started to fire. Killed... everyone. The commander was killed, too. What did you do? I jumped in the car and then I left. They followed me. They fired and fired. I don't remember getting into the lake. I just remember the truck going underwater. The explosives, they were left under the seat. Why didn't you take them out, huh? Because I can't swim. I was always afraid of water. What kind of a mortar was it? It's called "Katyusha." Comrade Captain, is that the unit we need? It is. It's time to act now. Attention. Listen to me. Altynov, the tower! Altynov, blow up the vehicle now! We have to retreat! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Easy. Easy, easy. Easy. Easy. Who's there? Come out of there! Come out! On the cart, now. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Lie down. Oh, God, how thin she is! Come on, now, eat. She's not thin. All ballet dancers have a regime. Where did the two of you come from? We're from Leningrad. How did you end up here? We came to visit our grandparents. For the summer, to Bystrovka. And then the war started. And where are your grandparents now? The Germans bayoneted them. Dead in their yard. Oh, dear Lord! Are there Germans here? Not in our village. They're stationed in Vyselki. I'm ready. Code the message. Seventeenth to third. The group is at the scheduled place right now. intensive searches are being continued. Effective... and mission-capable. Entrusted task will be completed at any cost. The mortar gun left at the territory occupied by the enemy will be destroyed. Group Commander, Captain Ermakov. Period. The woods are good here. Not many gnats. No animals, though. Sesingaly, tell me, where are you from? From Altai. I'm Kazakh. That's far away. And I was born near Putyvl. - Ukrainian? - No. I'm Goryun. - Who? - It's an ethnic group. Well, it's not very big at all. And with this damn war going on and on... It will be over soon. That's what you thought back home. We got out of the encirclement, two weeks walking in enemy rear. Our troops retreated back to Moscow. No, it won't be over soon. So I guess we're gonna fight, then. Do you know how many boys like you were taken to the front back in June? They were young, singing songs and laughing. They wanted to fight and win. And then they were all sent under these tanks. - Hold it, Siavris. - What's wrong, Commander? They have a right to know. Incoming! Retreat! Siavris! Slava! Slava! - Slava, where does it hurt? - My leg! - What's that? - His leg. All right, easy, easy, easy. Come on. Let me take your boot off. Here. Come on, come on, come on! Nice and easy. Here we go. All right. It's all right. Knife. There, there. There. There. Seems like the bone's OK. You OK? I'm fine, I'm fine. Doesn't hurt at all. - It's OK, Slava. - Yeah, I'm fine. Take your time. - Are the rest of you all right? - Yes. - OK, just a sec. - Altynov, I need water. Now the bandage. They were aiming at us. Must have spotted us when we sent the message. Is the transmitter damaged? No. Altynov... listen to my order. Take the radio. You must go now. Here, to this grid. Then you must connect with Moscow every two hours. - Is everything clear? - Yes, sir. Go ahead. Yes, sir. Subbotina, the place where Knysh was left, can you find it? Yes, Comrade Captain, sir. It's in the south-west. Yes. It's grid five. Go ahead. Yes, sir. Belous. Can you walk? Yes, sir. Off you go, then. The coast is clear. Let's go. - Tikhon! - What? Look. Are those partisans... or gangsters? Mmmmm. That's some good stuff. Nice and strong. Good job. What do you think you're doing? What are you doing, you jerk? Get some liquor, some moonshine. Come on. We need to warm up. Move it! But I don't have a drop of alcohol! Oh, don't you really? None? No. We don't make it. Stop lying, you two! Just hand it over! So, that's how you fight the war? Shut up! It's quite a place that you guys got here! Holy cow! Hey, guys! Guys, I found it! Hehe. Well, well! So, you do make moonshine, you no-good Boches' bootlicker. That's turpentine. It's not for drinking. It's for paint and varnish. A craftsman? A carpenter. Look at your soldier! His rifle butt, it's cracked. He should give it to me. I can... I'll fix it in no time. Oh, what a surprise. Look who's here. Well, come out. Come on, come on, come on. - Liova... - Come on! Don't be shy, we're all friends. My niece and nephew from Vyselki. You were hiding Jews? My sister's kids. Well, you must... be rewarded for that, my dear man. What's your name? Larisa. He's my brother. How old is he, then? I'm almost 12. OK. Now, listen to my order. You are now members of my unit. We'll be fighting together, all right? Let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go! Come on, come on. You beautiful thing. It's 50! It's 50! Knysh! - Are you partisans? - Yeah, we are. Who's this tied-up guy, a traitor? Uh huh. Do you think they're gonna give me a gun? Of course they will, after you take an oath. Here. - I found this. - Did he desert? No, he couldn't. - Something must have happened. - Mmhmm. Don't stigmatize the guy right away. Maybe he's in trouble? - Stop talking, Siavris. - Yes, sir. Can you walk? Yes, sir. Very good. Let's dislocate to the bridge observation point. Follow me. Slava, take this. Move it, move it, move it. Come on, come on, come on. So, you're not from here, huh? We're from Leningrad. Have you ever been there? Sure thing. Gnat, you're the next to bring water. I'm not a water boy, Sergeant. - What? - You heard me. You're way too bold, dude. What will the next order be? Well, now it's time for a suitability assessment. A hundred meters. Run from here to that tree way over there. Go on, I'll time you. Ready? Get set. Ready? I'm ready. And go! Untie me! Come on! Untie my hands, right now! Hurry up! Take that! Ferz! [heavy breathing[ It's OK. Nobody will hurt you anymore. Liova. Liova... Liova was very talented. He was... He was even told he'd... become the new Tsiolkovsky. He... Once, he made... he made a Zeppelin model for our dad's birthday. Don't cry. They've already paid for that. Here they are. They got moving. Looks like we've stirred up that hornets' nest. So many of them. They must have hidden your "Katyusha." I wish we knew where. They'll take it to the station sooner or later. What do we do, Commander? Belous, Galiyev. Come here. Come on! Wait for me, guys! You OK? - Can't walk anymore. - Where are you taking me, huh? Shut up! I was happy when I saw you guys. I thought, "Thank God, our troops came!" Because we've been waiting and waiting. Stop talking, now! Oh, come on! Give me a grenade. What are you up to? - None of your business. - Yeah? So, you like being under German rule, huh? Oh, no way! It wasn't my choice, you know. I was forced. It just happened! You know what? My wife and I were going to join the partisans, and then you came here. Comrade Captain! They got moving. They're going somewhere. Forty. And 60. Prisoner snatched. Mission accomplished. Comrade Kovzik. That over there is the barn where they put the machine. The one they pulled out of the lake. They're coming for us. Looking for you. Well, I mean, for us. Stay down, all right? They're sure we're in this grid now. Commander! They're leaving! They spotted Altynov. Good job, Sesingaly. Commander! The deminers! Look, they're checking the road. What does that mean? It means, Siavris... that right after they check the road... they will start transporting the launching unit. Galiyev, follow me! The wire's long enough to reach the bank. When you attach the charge, retreat downstream, OK? Don't worry, Comrade Captain. I'm much more comfortable in the water. I lived near the sea, in Feodosia. Listen, you take care, Galiyev. What on earth can happen to me, Captain? He won't make it. What? So, where's your launching unit? Maybe it's in the wrong place? It's the right place, I swear. You see the car tracks? They had to blow up the unit here. - I don't understand. - What do we do now? No idea. Come on, let's spend the night here and follow the tracks tomorrow. Come on. They brought all the villagers to reconstruct that bridge. They surely don't waste time. Maybe they won't make it before it gets dark? Darkness isn't an obstacle. The security of the barn has been increased. We should blow it up with the machine inside. We used all the explosives for the bridge. I left a box with TNT under the seat in the truck. It's gonna be enough for five cars. The Germans must have found it by now. Yeah, we can't go there in daytime. Does it hurt? It's OK. Here, take this. Will make it easier for you. - Thank you. - Nothing to thank me for. We'll attack when it gets dark. Now, listen. If the charge is under the seat, we'll blow up the truck right there. If not... we'll drive it further away. And then what? And then we'll think. The Germans are gonna catch us while we think. You better sink it. Uh huh. He already tried that. Not the best option. You had to sink it in our swamp. There's a swamp here. It's about eight or nine kilometers away. A farm tractor sunk there in 1939. It was gone in the blink of an eye, both the tractor and a trailer. My nephew Pasha, the driver, God bless his soul, had no chance of getting out. Can we drive there? Yes, there's a corduroy. A what? It's a log path, right over the swamp. All right. We'll go to the swamp. We have to take down the sentries quietly. I'll do it without a sound. From 50 meters or so. All right, then. We have no choice. We'll have to attack. After it gets dark. Here, put it on. It's getting cold. Thank you. - Hey, don't overcook it! - It didn't even boil yet. Moshkin. And I thought my last name was funny, until I met Moshkin. What is your last name? Fedia Knysh. People laughed at me. Well, they still do. They say I'll hardly get a wife with such a last name. "Pish, pish. Fedia Knysh." Sounds good for a scarecrow. It's boiling already! Take it off the fire! Come on, come on! All right, all right. Good. Looks good, huh, guys? There, there. It's overcooked. Here. - What about you? - Later. Thank you. Galiyev is so lucky. He was an orphan. No one to be notified. I can only imagine what would happen to my parents if they got a death notice about me. Dad's got heart problems, and Mom... I didn't even get a chance to say my goodbyes. My brother was about to get married, and I came here. And my aunt promised to give me her wedding ring when I get married. She got it from her great-grandma. Rings are just a bourgeois relic. - Really? - Mmhmm. I guess that depends on the bride. You got a family? I'm a bigamist. I've got one family in the village and one family in the city. My wife was to give birth in July. I don't know what it is - a boy or a girl. Your parents? No. They... The typhoid took them in the '20s. And yours? My mom's in Leningrad. Oh. The Germans won't get us there, for sure. Come on. Subbotina, take the weapon. Belous, take up defense. No, wait! Come on! Siavris! Siavris! What's in there? The explosives? It's empty. No explosives. Start it. We're leaving. Comrade Captain, turn it, sir. Give me light, Kovzik. Hold it! I need light. Just a sec. OK, OK, OK. Now I know why it didn't start. They didn't know we connect plus to the ground and minus to the circuit. Just a second. - Come on, Siavris! Hurry! - Almost done. - You OK? - I'm fine! The ammo! Vika! All right, I'm almost done. I'm done! Now, turn it again. It's working! What is it? That's it. We're done. We're all out of petrol. It's no use. I told you, there's no petrol. - Siavris. - What? - Get behind the wheel. - What for? We'll take the truck to the galley. Come on, Kovzik, push it. Don't worry, we'll make it. Come on. Come on, come on, come on! That's it. Enough. Kovzik! Where's Kovzik? He's gone. Hey, you, come here. I don't understand. Nicht verschtein. Officer, I'm going home. I was at my goddaughter's party in that village. I don't understand. Where are the saboteurs? Tell me, man. You don't think this machine is worth more than the kids' lives? If this unit falls into enemy hands, it will take more lives. - We have an order. - An order! They're kids, for God's sake! Have you ever had kids in your life? I had... a son. He died? He was killed. My wife, too. When our outpost was bombed. I'm sorry. And now what? Moshkin! Moshkin! Moshkin, get up! - Come on! - What is it? Move it! So? That's it. - Comrade Commander! - Knysh! It's me! - Ninety-nine! - And one, Knysh! - I brought help! - Private Moshkin! It's Kovzik! Open the door! Make sure you tie it down tight. - Thank you. - God bless you. Gee! Giddyap! Gee! Giddyap! Wait! Wait! Whoa. Wait for me! I'll go with you! I'll come back for you. I swear I will. Gee! Giddyap! Gee! - Giddyap! - Fyodor! - Gee! - Fyodor! You have a good name! Do you hear me? It will be OK! And I don't think it's funny at all. Gee! Whoa. Now we'll make it for sure. Start it, Knysh! Done! Now, go! We'll cover you! All right! Let's go! What is it, Commander? I don't know. I can't feel my legs. Oh, my God! Come on, let's switch places. Can you take care of switching gears? Yeah. Then right into second. - Gee! - Head to the glade! They won't make it through! - Gee! - Come on, to the right! Come on! Gee! - Come on, faster! - Gee! Hey! Hey! Knysh! Knysh! You OK? - You OK? - Yeah. - I'm fine. - Where's the group? - I'm fine - Where's the... Into first, then.
