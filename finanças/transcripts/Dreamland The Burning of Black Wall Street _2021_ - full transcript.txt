White Tulsans murdered Black folks and were hastily trying to get rid of the bodies by dumping them in mass graves around the city. Awful things were done to get rid of bodies. In the late 1990s when Senator Maxine Horner and my father, State Representative Don Ross created the commission to study the Tulsa race riot of 1921, which brought historians, consultants from around the world who tried to figure out what happened in 1921. I had many conversations with riot survivors. - Oh! - It was one of the proudest moments that I can remember of my father. When I wrote their first articles, uh, "South Tulsa Tales from the Crypt", I got a lot of attention.

You know, every high school student in Oklahoma has to go through an Oklahoma history course. It never came up. My dad had been president of the Tulsa Historical Society. It never came up. Hearing about that, it was shocking to me because I love Tulsa. I couldn't believe that Tulsa would be the kind of city where something like that could happen. We have Tulsans of an undetermined number who were murdered in this event.

One of those ways was a practice of chattel slavery to boost oneself economically. - At the Cherokee museum today are slave Bills of Sale, including one by then Principal Chief John Ross. - I don't ever talk about it very much because I think it's a very shameful part of, um, of Cherokee history, and so I've purposely avoided involving myself in that whole issue. ♪ Java man he made a life ♪ ♪ But the mammy ain't his wife ♪ ♪ Choppin' cotton don't be slow ♪ ♪ Better finish out yo' row. ♪ - Slavery in the five civilized tribes varied. What's really important to remember is that these people were enslaved. So, by definition, it wasn't a good experience because if you're a slave, then you don't have your individual liberty, which arguably matters more than anything else. - Enslaving Black people, it was part of the economy of those tribes. When the Americans now wanted that land for their own plantations, they took the plantations of the Indians. This was done in a legal way... by passing legislation, The Indian Removal Act, the forced migration of the five civilized tribes from the Southeastern United States into Indian territory, which is what is today Oklahoma. - They said, well, we're swapping you this land for the lands west of the Mississippi in Indian territory.

Black people who had been with the Indians, now 10, 15 generations, either enslaved or married among them or their children. They were called the Freedmen. The United States government forced the Tribes to divide up this land with the Freedmen. - The slaves who belonged to the Cherokees could come right back to the territory and settle on Indian land.

I think the thing that bothered me the most was not being able to ask questions and have a discussion or hear about it as just a kid growing up, a white kid. - The only reason that Black Wall Street existed was because of necessity.

You know, in Tulsa, like in other southern cities, African Americans can't go into a department store and try on clothes. But they can shop in their own neighborhoods. So, what happens is the merchants in Greenwood had this captive population and the money just flows and flows and flows. - And it was successful because they were supported by people who looked like them, would purchase from them, do business with them. - So, there's people that are living all different lives and different social standings but everyone here is making a living whatever way they- they decide to.

There was nothing that you could not do. - When thinking about Tulsa in the early part of the 20th century, it's important to remember where the Greenwood community is. It abuts downtown, separated by the Frisco tracks. If you live in a society in which white supremacy is the prevailing paradigm, but you live in a community in which you can look across the dividing line, the Frisco tracks, and see Black folks driving nice cars and wearing fur coats and living in nice homes, then it causes cognitive dissonance, garden variety jealousy. That land was desired by corporate interest in Tulsa. We know that. The idea was to remove the Black folks from the land, move them farther north, and use the land for what was considered to be higher and better purposes. - Tulsa appears now to be in danger of losing its prestige as the whitest town in Oklahoma.

President Woodrow Wilson endorsed it. It showed all over the country. It showed in Tulsa in the convention hall. It certainly validated these ideas. - How do you survive if you're a Black person in America during this era? And part of the answer came through African American veterans of World War I who'd fought in combat units in France where they were treated with respect and with honor. And they came back to the United States and they found none. - We have Black veterans in Greenwood. They fought for their country, they fought for their freedom. So, when they come home, they expect to be respected. But what they come home to is, again, more Jim Crow laws, more prejudice, and more restrictions on their freedom that they fought for. - After World War I, in uniform being lynched by white mobs. It's pretty stunning and remarkable. The idea is we're going to show you what your place is. We don't care whether you've fought for the country. When you're here, you play by our rules. - The Ku Klux Klan is kind of the bogeyman. I think, especially as white people, we load up all the bad stuff and we attribute it to this vague group over here that we call the Ku Klux Klan. Even the people who considered themselves friends of the Black people didn't really consider them equals in a social way. I mean, they- they didn't want them-- they didn't want them killed, they didn't want them cheated, they didn't want their houses burned down but they didn't want to sit next to 'em in the restaurant either. In those times, Tulsa was like a lot of other places. You had African Americans who were just sort of tired of being sent to the back of the bus, literally and figuratively.

There had to have been tension building up. - The Tulsa Tribune published a series of inflammatory articles... ...that really fomented hostility in the white community against the Black community. ♪♪ Tulsa was a powder keg, a tinderbox needing only something to set the community alight. - Many years ago, I was at a cemetery.

Then I heard that same sound surrounding me. Tsshh. I ran out of there. That's when I saw a flock of redbirds come out of the trees. I thought that was unusual. Normally you see one or two redbirds, but I never saw a flock of them flying together like that. And I told a good friend of mine and she said, you saw redbirds in a cemetery? Oh, baby, that's nothin' but an omen, she said. That was the spirit of the dead telling you to go tell somebody that they are not at peace. - The ancestors are speaking to us. The ancestors are throwing clues at us. We have a responsibility and an obligation to find the truth. - The mass graves investigation started out in 1997, actually, with Don Ross, Kavin Ross' father. - When he was first told about the massacre, my father, he thought it was just a lie, that it didn't happen. It was not in the history books. But then in high school, he heard first-hand from survivors who were schoolteachers at the time and that was something that stuck with him until he got to the point where he could do something about it. - White political leaders tried to bury the truth along with all those Black victims of the riot. And they pretty much succeeded for 76 years until 1997, when the state legislature appointed a commission of 11 people to finally uncover the truth about the horrific riot of 1921. - Don Ross went to the governor and the legislature and said, we've never had an official study of this little-known event. - That was inspired by the Oklahoma City bombing. Uh, when they said it was the largest urban disaster in America, wrong. Uh, more people were killed than any such disaster, wrong. - I was asked to be the historian for the commission. During that period, I was thinking maybe we could use this to figure out how many people died and where they were buried. - I'm ready. - Kavin, you good? - Go ahead. - Hi, I'm Eddie Faye Gates, chair of the Survivors Committee of the Oklahoma Legislative Commission to study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. - I was a videographer for the race riot commission report.

He was ten at the time, drawn by the curious sight of men digging a trench with large boxes stacked nearby. - Clyde Eddy talked about at the age of ten, when he was at the Oaklawn Cemetery, he saw these giant boxes. He and his cousin would go to one of these crates. - We opened the first box, and there were, um-- excuse me. There were three bodies of Black people. The stench was terrible. - There were other boxes. Lift up the lid, and that saw that there was Black folks inside of that one. Black people in a box, dead. That's something that would be etched in your mind forever, and so for him to tell a story with such conviction. I said, let's dig 'em up now. - So many people have said there were no bodies there. But you know, all the Black folk in the community, we believe they're there. Those stories were passed on to us. - Inch by inch, crews are digging into the history of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. Tulsa's mayor, G.T. Bynum, initiated the investigation to try and find if there are any victims buried in mass graves. - There was a systematic cover up of the event. It should not have taken 99 years. - We have to pay attention, we have to pick up the charred baton that has been left in our hands, and figure out where the screams are coming from. ♪♪ - Monday, May 30, 1921. It happened to be Memorial Day. - May 30th could have happened at any point in time because Tulsa was already a powder keg. We do know that the deathly KKK members that are part of the police force, proudly marching down the street on Memorial Day. People describe it as a massacre, I've been calling it a war. - There's systemic causes for what happened here in 1921, but you fixate on this trigger incident that involved a Black boy and a white girl on an elevator. The teenage boy is a boy named Dick Rowland. He's at work on Memorial Day, shining shoes in Downtown Tulsa. - Dick Rowland was nineteen years old in the spring of 1921. He worked in a white-owned and white-patronized shine parlor on Main Street in Downtown Tulsa. - His nickname is "Diamond Dick" so he's known to be this flashy young guy. [laughing] He is just another person in the community that everyone knows, but he's-he's never been seen as a troublemaker. - There's not a restroom facility in the shine parlor, so the white owner has arranged for them to walk down Main Street to the Drexel Building. On the fourth floor there was, quote, "a colored restroom". Something happens when he enters the elevator. Elevators are-are manually operated by a wheel, it takes a great amount of skill to get the floor of the elevator and the actual floor to line up. That particular elevator was very difficult to center, so the belief is, that as Dick walked onto the elevator, he tripped and just, by reflex, threw his hands out to cushion the fall, that he grabbed Sarah by the shoulder, ripped her dress, she screams, and he realizes this is a dangerous moment for him, and he runs out of the elevator and takes off. But there was a white clerk at the Renberg's Clothing Store who heard the scream, saw Dick run out of the building, and in his mind he puts two and two together, and says, "This is an interracial rape attempt." The Tulsa Police are summoned, but they don't put out an all-points bulletin for Dick Rowland, they don't go searching for him. They're not particularly worried about this event. However, the Tulsa Tribune, Tulsa's white daily afternoon newspaper, decides to portray this incident in a completely different light. - The "Tribune" published an account of the elevator incident entitled, "Nab Negro for Attacking Girl In an Elevator". The "Tribune" essentially claimed that Dick Rowland tried to rape Sarah Page in broad daylight in a public building in Downtown Tulsa. The article went out of its way to make Sarah Page look virtuous, and, as a corollary, to make Dick Rowland look villainous, playing on that white female, Black male taboo. - So the next morning, Tuesday, May 31st, the Tulsa Police decide, "We're gonna pick up Dick Rowland". So they go to where he lives with his mother in Greenwood, arrest him, take him to the courthouse, and like, as with other prisoners, put him up on the-- in the fourth floor jail. The first edition of the "Tulsa Tribune" hits the streets around 3:00, 3:30. Within thirty minutes there's lynch talks on the streets of Tulsa. Lynch talk soon turns into a lynch mob. Meanwhile, Black people are trying to figure out what's going on, what to do, how to organize. On the stage of the Dreamland Theatre, an African-American World War I Vet jumps up on the stage and says, "Shut this place down. "We ain't gonna let this happen here." "It" being a lynching. There was a feeling amongst Black vets that if trouble comes my way, I ain't dodgin' it. In Tulsa there had not been an African-American lynched, and there were Black men and women who were prepared to make sure that didn't happen. Around 10:30 at night or a little before then, a rumor gets greenlit that whites are storming the jail. Seventy-five African-American men, all armed, drive to the courthouse. They march up to the courthouse, they go up to the sheriff, who's waiting for them on the steps, and they say, "We are here to help to protect the prisoner "if you need our help." Sheriff McCullough says, "Get the hell out of here, "I don't want you." [crowd yelling] As they are leaving, an elderly white man goes up to a tall Black vet, and says, "Where you goin' with that gun?" And the vet says, "I'm gonna use it if I need to." The white man says, "Like hell you are." Tries to get the gun, there's a struggle, a shot goes off. [gun shot] The worst incident of racial violence in American history begins. - As the evening starts to fall, May 31st, by seven o'clock there are already hundreds of people circling around the courthouse. By nine, ten is where things really start to reach this sort of, uh boiling point, and shots are fired. At the same time all this is happening downtown. You have people that are still waiting to go to their prom at Booker T. Washington. You have people that are still going to movies in the Dreamland and the [indistinct] Theater. You have people that are still moving about their lives that aren't aware of what's happening. - We went down to a late show, movie. Somebody came in and shouted, "Nigger fight! Nigger fight!" We went out the door and just got there when a Negro ran out of the alley. The minute his head showed outside, somebody shot him. And, uh, this man was shot and rolled out in the middle of the street with a revolver in his hand. And this crowd around him wouldn't let anybody touch him, pick him up, wouldn't let an ambulance take him. But he was the first man that was shot in the riot. - Nobody cares about Dick Rowland anymore. The white mob is now out to get any Black person in their sights. - The teeming white mob spilled over the Frisco tracks into the Greenwood community... - ...carrying rifles, pistols, matches, and cans of gasoline. ♪♪ - In the words of one of the massacre survivors, "All hell broke loose." Looting... shooting... burning, destroying everything in sight. - People are taking shelter in their homes or packing up their stuff and fleeing, whatever they can. - My Mother said, "Here they come, "here they come." And they came in the house with torches and they set the house on fire. Oh, it was like a nightmare. Everything was in flames. - On the evening of May 31st, my little girl had not retired but was watching the people from the window. She said, "Mother, I see men with guns." Then I ran to the window and looked out. There I saw many people gathered in little squads, talking excitedly. There was a great shadow in the sky, and upon second look we discerned that this cloud was caused by fast-approaching airplanes. It then dawned upon us that the enemy had organized in the night and was invading our district the same as the Germans invaded France. I took my little girl, Florence Mary, by the hand and fled out the West door on Greenwood, running amidst showers of bullets. - I was so afraid, because bullets were coming down around us. All of the planes were up in the air, shooting down, and I could hear those bullets falling. There were a lot of people running, dodging the bullets, and just afraid. - They're shooting people on sight, even if you're complying with their demands. That's what happened to Dr. A.C. Jackson. - A.C. Jackson was a prominent Black surgeon, he was accosted at his home, he exited his house in compliance with the demands of the mobsters, hands held high. But he was actually gunned down by a young white man and he ultimately bled to death. Black men put up a vigorous, robust defense. They were outgunned, and outnumbered, and overmatched. The violence lasted sixteen hours, a unit of the National Guard sent in from Oklahoma City. ♪♪ When the dust settled, at least 1,250 homes in the Black community were destroyed. Between 100 and 300 people, most of them Black, were killed. ♪♪ - So twenty years ago, we had a mayor here that said, "Hey. "We're gonna go into Oaklawn and were gonna excavate, "because we have an idea of where some bodies might be." - We brought in ground penetrating radar; they showed that there were anomalies in these areas. - I was twenty years younger, standing out in Oaklawn. We were all out there, but we were about to do this, right? They called it off abruptly because there was a white family that did not want that area to be disturbed. They suggested that there was a, perhaps, a white body that was buried underground and that that body would have been disturbed as you're looking for race massacre dead. - Our effort got caught up in politics. - A bunch of lawmakers, they pretty much didn't really care. It made the state look bad. - I am thoroughly convinced that the state of Oklahoma was not culpable. - We were shut down by the City of Tulsa, and at that point, I, you know, I thought the ballgame was over. - For some people it's like, "Why are you guys desecrating the grave?" - Right. - We're not desecrating graves, we're finding out the truth. - And those answers-- ancestors had never had a proper burial. - Absolutely. - I was on the City Council at the time. Years later, a local journalist-- - My name's Lee Roy Chapman, and this is "Public Secrets". - He did a video series about Tulsa's hidden secrets. [squeaking] And one of them, I was watching... - Um, Oaklawn Cemetery has been rumored for nearly a hundred years to be the, uh, location of a mass grave, uh, attributed to the Tulsa Race Riot. - What's my immediate reaction? There is no way that could possibly be true. The mass grave in Oaklawn cemetery, where my great grandparents are buried, and that no one would have ever bothered to look. This is a historic day for Tulsa and for our country as we begin a test excavation in Oaklawn Cemetery. - There's nothing abstract, there's nothing theoretical. This is not a research project. This is an investigation. - Scientists are set to finally break ground in the effort to find victims of the Tulsa Race Massacre. - Nearly 100 years later, the families to victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre could get answers and closure. - It should have been done well before now, but it wasn't. That is a baton that's been handed to us, and it is-- it is not an easy race. The initial excavation will be focused on a location within Oaklawn Cemetery that we felt had a high likelihood for encountering a mass grave. We focused on an anomaly, uh, that had been detected. That anomaly to us was an indication that it was possibly a mass grave. As we were excavating down, we very quickly realized that we had materials that didn't really belong there. - The search turned up many old artifacts, but after reaching three and a half meters in depth, the excavation was called off on Wednesday. - We do not have indications of a mass grave, um, in this portion of Oaklawn Cemetery. There is a-a heavy weight of responsibility that comes with trying to assist in this effort. There is that sense of optimism that comes from the fact that the investigation has been reopened. But you-you also are worried because it has-- there's a perpetual feeling that the other shoe is gonna fall, and this expectation of disappointment. But it's extremely important to remember why we're there and who we're trying to find. - Sometimes stuff just makes you want to just give up, but other times those are those times like, no, you keep going, 'cause the ancestors are not gonna let you give up, they're gonna keep pushing you. When you say you quit, they say, "No, you don't", it puts you right back up and do it all over again. - That's why it's cold today. The ancestors are like, "You're gonna feel the chill of my bones today, man." - Ooohh. - Yes. - Ooohh. - That's what-that's what they want us to feel. They want everybody to feel what that feels like. - There's all kinds of good things that you find in South Tulsa. You'll find computer stores, you'll find bookstores, you'll find twenty-four hour pharmacy, you'll find health food stores. None of those things can be found in North Tulsa. North Tulsa's a food desert, and that's got to change. - One of the things that people don't generally know is that the Greenwood community actually came back after it was destroyed. - It was rebuilt because the rural community, uh, rural lands were still owned mostly by Black folk. But by the 1960s, these towns started to disappear. - There is this idea that Greenwood was destroyed in 1921, and that's the end of the story. But there's 100 years after that that we need to talk about. - Tulsa is just a tale of two cities. North Tulsa's a predominantly African-American community. And South Tulsa you have predominantly white community. This city of Tulsa is the most segregated city, geographically, economically, socially, and all of the above. - Growing up in North Tulsa, I started to notice buildings looked different, institutions looked different. Wow, there's a whole 'nother world I wasn't even aware of. We've already experienced dislocation, urban removal, eminent domain, all of those things. Those people who lived in Greenwood saw its demise twice. [explosion rumbling] - The people who have lived in an urban center for many years certainly do have rights. However, they do not have the right to frustrate the creative efforts of very diligent people who are trying to bring back vitality, and wholeness, and beauty into the city. - I grew up at 1415 North Greenwood. We owned the house on Greenwood. When I grew up, I had a church in front of me, right literally behind me was the school that I went to, to my right was the Black hospital that I was born in, that was Morton Hospital, and then we had Jack's Memory Chapel right there, so the whole cycle of life was right within a block and a half of me where I lived. That's the community I grew up in. As happened in every city across this nation in the sixties, seventies, there was something called urban, what they call renewal, what I call urban removal. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, when they want to talk about Black folks, right, instead of saying, "Black folks live over here. "That's the urban area." Right? "That's urban music." Just call things as they are. - To whites, the words urban renewal have a promising, hopeful sound. But to Blacks, they mean move out. In a block like this, as many as a thousand men, women, and children have been forced out in the name of some progress yet to come. - So urban renewal was coming through telling you all, "Those houses that you're living in here, "we have a better use" as they say, "a greater use for this land." And they tell you, "We're gonna renew your community, "and this is gonna be better then you left it." They moved us out of our houses for the "greater good". We were dislocated from our home. And when I tell you there's still a big space at 1415 North Greenwood, nothing was ever built there, but they told us we had to go. And then you saw the decline of Greenwood as you saw folks moved out of their homes. - The reason and the causes of this economic downturn was the construction of the Crosstown Expressway that cut through the heart of Greenwood. In fact, they took the heart out. Urban renewal and this major highway construction really took out the-- most of the entrepreneurial, uh, businesses that were there. - Just this area's changed a lot with the, uh-- uh, Crosstown coming through. Hasn't a lot of the business moved out? - That's correct. - What happened in Tulsa happened all over the United States. Highways were located right through the heart of communities of color. - I started photographing back in 1969 here at North Tulsa, the Greenwood area. And what I saw in the Greenwood area was that there were a lot of businesses that were closing up. One of those photographs that I took on Greenwood, he was a tall gentle, and erect proud Black man, I call it Baltimore Barbershop that I took in 1970. He went to the window and started looking out the window, and what he saw was bulldozers tearing down buildings in front of him. And I asked him what he thought about that, and he said, "Well, I think I'm gonna be next." So I took his photograph and, uh, the next day I came back, sure enough, his business was gone and so was he. Most of the businesses in that area were boarded up, and all that remained was a [indistinct] of Black Wall Street. It was no longer Black Wall Street, it was a ghost town. ♪♪ - Oh man, I tell ya... - We owned a skating rink there. During the riot it got burned down, our home got burned down. We lost all of this-- our property, our home. - Every church, our schoolhouses was blown up. People were killed, and you go in and see the people mangled. And then some people you never heard of anymore of, you don't know where they-- whether they were killed, whether they'd just left town. - On the morning of June 1st, after the massacres, the National Guard and some police and maybe some civilians began rounding up all of the African-American population in Greenwood that they-that they could. There were between five and seven thousand people detained. And the reason given for that was that it was for their own protection, that they were gonna be put some place safe. Everybody who was still in custody was moved to the fairgrounds east of Greenwood. They set up cots in a kitchen, they dug latrines. The people who stayed there were expected to work. The women would prepare the meals, the men were sent out to work cleaning up Greenwood. - Folks in these internment camps had to have a green card. - I don't know how they got these little cards printed so fast, but everybody had a little I.D. card, school children and all, told what you did, and you had to have that little I.D. wherever you went. - And to get out of these internment centers, they needed to be countersigned by a white person. Essentially, a white person would vouch for them and get them out of these internment centers. The theory at-- by the authorities was that this was done to protect people from physical harm in a context of this chaotic situation. There wasn't a lot of justification that was needed because who has power and who doesn't? - The people who had homes to go to went to those homes. Some people left town. The Red Cross was operating out of Booker T. Washington High School, and the Red Cross would buy them a train ticket if they wanted to leave town. - I found that the high school building was still standing. I saw a big white streamer with a red cross on it. I felt pangs of joy, for this meant to me that I was getting in close touch with friends again. I breathed a prayer of thanks. - The Red Cross began obtaining these tents that people could live in. - Many Black families spent days, weeks, months living in tent cities on the charred earth. - Everything they had was gone, and they were expected to immediately just go about their lives like nothing had happened. Y-You have to think the trauma was-was terrible. - When we reaching the house, I saw my piano and all my elegant furniture piled in the street. My safe had been broken open, all my money stolen, all my silverware, cut glass, all my family clothing, and everything of value had been removed, even my family Bible. Our car was stolen and most of my large rugs were taken. I lost seventeen houses that paid me an average of over $425 per month. ♪♪ - Riot is a term of art, really. These events throughout the nation during this period were called "Race Riots". And it's significant in part because insurance polices, for example, during that period often had exclusionary clauses. And so if your damage was occasioned by riot or civil unrest, the insurance company didn't have to pay. One of the things we know is that a number of people in the mob that destroyed the Greenwood community were deputized by local law enforcement officers; much of that was done by a wink and a nod. Those people knew that they were not going to be impeded by law enforcement. The massacre was referred to, in some documents, as a Negro uprising, which suggests that the Black community's to blame. - In the immediate aftermath there was a grand jury, and it indicted, I think it's 88 people. Some of whom were white, most of whom were Black. - First was the indictment of J.B. Stradford who owned a hotel and was a lawyer. A.J. Smitherman was the editor and publisher of "The Tulsa Star", which is the leading Black newspaper. He, along with a number of other Black men was indicted for inciting a riot. - Let the blame for this Negro uprising lie right where it belongs: on those armed Negroes and their followers who started this trouble and who instigated it. And any persons who seeks to put half the blame on the white people are wrong. - It is one of the big ironies of-of all of this that the two people who are most often seen at the center of it are two people that we know very, very little about. Sarah Page left the day after the massacre. She left town and never came back as far as we know. Dick Rowland, it appears, remained in jail through the summer and then was released. In September, the county attorney said he'd received a letter from Sarah Page asking not to press charges. People had really lost interest in it. - No white person's ever held accountable for the some 100 to 300 deaths that we believe occurred, uh, during the massacre. - I've never spoken to a white Tulsan who would admit to be a member of the mob during the riot. And one reason is simply this: there's no statute of limitations on murder. These homicides have now entered the historic realm, they can no longer be prosecuted, there's no one left to prosecute. - The massacre destroyed the superstructure, but miraculously the basement survived. This is a picture of the basement. So this picture was taken August 1921, and the massacre happened May 31st through June 1st. People came and hid in our basement during the massacre. You see ashes above every window piece except the back window. So this is the space where that window frame that we saw that had no ash on top of it, it's still right there. If you can imagine people being in this room not knowing if the fire would somehow come through or come from above, but they managed to survive in this space. When I learn about bodies being dumped in mass graves and not ever receiving a proper burial, that touched me as a pastor on a visceral level. ♪♪ As a pastor, when you bury somebody it's more than just giving a eulogy. When we do what we call the committal, which is that ashes to ashes, that dust to dust over their bodies, that is our way of spiritually releasing them to go wherever they're going. And to deny that to the people that were dumped or killed during the race massacre is evil! It shows you that at that time period people didn't even care about the souls of Black folks, let alone their bodies. I believe there is no expiration date on morality, and if it was wrong in 1921 and that it has not been repaired for today, then we ought to do something about it. - One of the most basic, I think, responsibilities that a city has to the residents who live there is if you're murdered, we'll do everything we can to try to find out what happened to you, to find your remains for your family, and to render justice for you and your family. - It makes me feel, um, kind of like Charlie Brown said, "good grief." Because it's good that we unveiled the story, but it's grief to us as we unveil it. Tell it right. They took those planes from that oil field and they planned an aerial attack, and that's what makes it different from all the other race riots in America. Tell it right. They bombed us, they bombed us. ♪♪ - There's something very spiritual about this work. And anybody who thinks that this sacred ground that we find ourselves on, this crime scene that we find ourselves on is not gonna speak, doesn't have the ears to hear. ♪♪ - Kavin Ross talks about the redbirds. He says that they are the spirits of our ancestors. Monday morning, I went out to my garden, and as I stepped on my back porch, I saw a whole bunch of redbirds, and they were looking at me. And I ran in here to get my phone, "Kavin, I gotta tell you the story of what happened "with the redbirds." He said, "Girly, come"-- he says girly. "Girly, come get your butt down here to the cemetery." Well, I knew something huge is gonna happen from that, and it did. ♪♪ - I'm here to report an update. I can confirm that we have identified, um, a large hole that had been excavated and into which several individuals, um, have been placed. This constitutes a mass grave. - Tonight scientists believe they have found evidence of a mass grave in Oklahoma. - More than a year after work had started at Oaklawn Cemetery, the team found human remains. - Today is a significant moment in the history of our city in trying to do right by the victims of this event. - When I heard that they found twelve bodies, I said, "Finally! Finally!" It's no longer folklore, it's no longer a rumor, it's true. And that's going just to be the beginning of justice. - People in this community who've been saying that bodies were dumped in mass graves, their stories have now been vindicated. Gets us one step closer to giving their families the opportunities to have the truth be known and actually give them a proper burial. - This is all part of a-a mission to get back what was lost. We've lost a lot of history, we've lost a lot of testimony, we've lost a lot of known heritage that could have been passed down because it wasn't safe to talk about for so long. - Nobody said nothing until now. We're just now talking about it. - Growing up, old folks have talked, and they actually kind of hid a lot of stuff from us. - Staying quiet was one of those ways of protecting yourself. It's kind of in the back of your mind, wondering could this happen again? What can I do to prevent this from happening again for my children? - That is another part of trauma, the silence that it creates. And while people were murdered and we need to acknowledge that and we need to find them, we also need to talk about how they lived. We need to talk about what they built, we need to talk about what's left behind and tell that story, because that story lasts for a hundred years, the massacre was two days. - Hut, hut. Come on, boy. Hut, hut, hut. Hut. People say, "Why don't you leave here?" Because the memory of something that I will never see anywhere else is still here. And these pages contain all of the photographs of my ancestors who lived on Greenwood. The memory, we're connected to our memories. Olivia Hooker, who was a survivor, was a really beautiful soul. - At that night of the massacre, Olivia Hooker, who was a six-year-old girl, saw her own home ripped apart. White folks came into her house, destroyed her piano with a hatchet, and when they left, she went over there and they struck the keyboard, and there was still sound coming out of that piano.
