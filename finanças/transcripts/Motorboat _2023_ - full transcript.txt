- Welcome back everyone. We've had even more disappearances lately that I believe is tied to the Brotherhood of Darkness cult that are Satanic worshipers, and they're dressed as hooded monks and they are led by one Messiah Ward. Now, if you haven't heard of these guys, they first popped up in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania, around a decade ago, but there's evidence that it could be even further back. They could have popped up around in the 80s, and they've potentially spread to other rural areas around the country. Now, as a Kaiju podcaster, the reason I'm talking about this is because there is a higher than average number of disappearances in areas that the cult is in, and the killings are brutal. I'm talking decapitation, disembowelment, dismemberment, and there's never been any ties or convictions made to the cult at all, and I believe I know why. The cult has enlisted the help of something else, a lake monster. - Tell me what you see. - What you ask for is in a dark place. - I need to know. - Silence. I need to concentrate to send my soul to see in such a terrible place. - If you find it, I can stop it here and now. - Evil that has existed for so long cannot be vanquished so easily, even by someone with so much faith. I see, I see shadowy figures full of hate and rage. I see twisted souls with no way of escape. I see blood and carnage. - Where are they? What location is home to this evil cancer? - A deep black pool of water. A dwelling nearby. It is all I can see. I cannot pass any further, and you, you must not interfere by yourself. - I must. It needs to end now. - Nothing ever ends. It takes on a different form and continues on the same path. Beware and be strong. - My children, my flock, welcome. We have been gathered here for our final sacrifice, as our master calls us to a darker place. Our shaman has seen it in a vision. We have been prosecuted through the ages for our service to our Lord. Burned at the stake by infidels. Now the time has arrived for our fiery transition. Do not fear. Do not fear. The brotherhood of darkness shall reign. Drink the life giving fluid as the hour draws near. We welcome your cold embrace, oh Master. We've been expecting you, old friend. Do what you came here to do. - Relish in hell. Enjoy your journey to the dark abyss. - What is it? - Huh? - Was it my beans from earlier? You're acting all distressed. - The air. It's so still, funny like. - Now you're just acting like a scared little child. - Nothing been same around here since... - Since? The suspense is killing me. - Since the massacre of Messiah Ward and his followers. - That jerk and his clan got what they deserved. Probably some secret op came in and wiped 'em out. None too soon. The Brotherhood of Darkness. They were no good for anybody. - They say his spirit still roams these parts in revenge for what happened to 'em. Maybe we should go. - Stop acting silly. Catch some fish so we can get on outta here. What the hell?! - What is that? - It's another boat. - Is it? - And they don't see us. Wave your arms around. They're about to run us over! Yo, hey yo! Yo, hey yo! - Hey, yo! - Yo, over here! - Right here! - Orville! Orville, oh my God. Where are you? Who are you? - Yes, old technology you can count on. Lake Jude Patrol Chief, Barney Rayl, speaking. How may I help you? What, a swamped boat at Lodger's Point? Probably Ned and Orville's. You know they're illegally fish in that spot all the time. Yep. Okay, I'll be right down. If that boat belongs to them, I'll fine them both this time. Barney to HQ. I'm in boat number seven and I'm heading to Lodger's Point to check on a swamped boat. I'll report in after I assess the scene, but I'm sure it belongs to Ned and Orville, out. - Smile and fog. - It's another sunny day here in Wellsboro, as we mark the two year anniversary of the Brotherhood of Darkness massacre. Messiah Ward may be long gone, but his shadow still casts a dark curtain over the town. However, our community is strong and we continue to heal. In lighter news, striper season is in full swing here as fishermen from all over descend on the lake for some of the finest fishing in the Northeast. - This is their boat, but where the hell are they? Damn! What the hell happened here? - Two men are dead in a boating accident during Wellsboro's annual Striper Fishing Season event. In an apparent hit and run, police said the other driver fled the scene and were currently investigating leads. Officials wouldn't comment further due to the ongoing investigation, but they asked if anyone has any information to call their local police department. In weather, a cold front is moving into the area later this week. - It's happening again. - Nice. Hello? - Hey, Lena, how's it going? You didn't call me this morning. - I decided to head over to the lake a little early. Making the most of my day off. Are you coming out later? - I might. Where are you exactly? - I'm near Lodger's Point. It's beautiful. - Hmm, I'd be careful. - Why? - I just heard on the news that the Lake Patrol found some bodies near there. - Well, you wouldn't know by looking around? What happened? - A boating accident, I think. - Oh, well there you go. Nothing to worry about. I'm gonna swim, not boat, so I should be fine. - Be careful just the same. That place has a history. I don't know why you don't use Bunk Beach instead. - It's too crowded over there. Lots of noisy brats and perverted learers. - The perverts are the most fun. - Figured you'd say that. Listen, give me a ring when you head over. - If I head over. - Okay, if you head over. We can grab some lunch by the concessions stand. - Okay, catch you later, bye. - See you. Ah. That's a boat. Better watch out for rocks, it's pretty shallow in this area. Hello? Hey asshole, you're not supposed mull your top this close to shore. Where'd you come from, anyway? Well get the hell outta here then! Ah, no, help! - Mm, that's some good Joe. Lake Jude Patrol Chief, Barney Rayl, speaking. How may I help you? What, another body? That's three in one day. Where? Lodger's Point. Okay, close off the area until further notice. I'll be right there. Dying around here is becoming a bad habit. - Who was Messiah Ward? Leader of the Brotherhood of Darkness cult. Very little is known about the man and his followers who have maintained a low profile since settling in the area some 10 years earlier. They've been blamed for the disappearance of several domestic animals by nearby residents, but nothing was ever proven. Some had even accused them of being behind the disappearance of two hikers some four years ago near the Mount Tom Trail. But again, no connections were ever made. - Well, what do you think? - It's obviously a boating accident. She got too close to the propeller. Whether it was a hit and run or malicious, I don't know. - Three boating accidents in 24 hours? Seems suspicious. - It does happen. When people drink and get into boats, all kinds of stupid things happen. It's a bad coincidence. - The question is, whose propeller killed her? - Excuse me, may I give this poor soul Last rights? No one should die without absolution. - A little late for that, don't you think? - The Lord is ready to receive anyone's soul, even after death. - Sure, go ahead, but be quick about it. - Please wait. - I'm not dead yet. I don't need last rights. - I have some information that may shed some light on these, accidents. - You hesitated, why? You don't think they're accidents? Let me guess, the devil did it. That guy must be a ninja. I didn't see him leave. Lake Jude Patrol Chief, Barney Rayl, speaking. How may I help you? - Hey Barney, I have a full report if you wanna listen. - I'm all ears. - Officially these were all boating related. In fact, the boys determined it was the same propeller. - Then it is homicide. - You know what that strange part is? - Other than we have a killer chopping up people on the lake with an outboard motor? - The blade marks aren't consistent with any prop on the market. It's completely new, maybe homemade. We're going to keep delving into it. - Thanks, you do that. Great, just great. - Two years since the Brotherhood of Darkness massacre and questions still remain. Police have revealed very little of what they know about the cult, and even a bigger mystery still remains. Who killed Messiah Ward and his followers on that fateful night? We may never know. - No, no. - My children, my flock, welcome. We have been gathered here for our final sacrifice, as our master calls us to a darker place. Our shaman has seen it in a vision. We have been prosecuted through the ages for our service to our Lord. Burned at the stake by infidels. Now the time has arrived for our firey transition. Do not fear. Do not fear- - No! - The Brotherhood of Darkness shall reign. Drink the life giving fluid as the hour draws near. - No, no, no. - We welcome your cold embrace, oh Master. - No! - I warn you, do not interfere. - Hello? This is Father Thomas. - I'm sorry to call you so late, but we need to talk. - Yes, yes we do. - Okay, Father Thomas, let's talk. Why don't you tell me what you know that can help my case? These weren't accidents we're dealing with. I'm calling it homicide. - You have every right to. - What's your take on this? - You want to know the truth? Even if it questions everything about the world around you? - I wouldn't expect someone in your profession to lie to me. Yes, the truth. - What you, what we are facing, is an evil force. An evil that has lived on beyond death, and it's here now. - What we are dealing with? - Yes, you because it affects you directly, and I, because of my actions, it's here. - You're not making much sense, Father Thomas. - Do you remember the Brotherhood of Darkness incident? - Of course, it was headline news. But they're long gone, right? - The Death of Messiah Ward. The massacre of the cult. I had something to do with that. - You were involved in the massacre? - Yes, I, and I alone am responsible for the demise of that death cult. Before you tell the police, we need to finish this. I will accept moral and legal ramifications for my actions. - Well, a lot of folks might see what you did as a favor, not a crime. - It is what it is. I will answer to God for my actions. But we must put a stop to this, now. - Why don't you start at the beginning? - Messiah Ward was my brother, both men of the cloth. Look how we turned out, a monster and a fallen priest. He, my brother, wanted the ultimate power. Found what he was looking for in Satan's palm. He enticed others to join him. And soon they were committing despicable acts in his name. I had to put a stop before it went any further. - We've been expecting you, old friend. Do what you came here to do. - Relish in hell and enjoy your journey to the dark abyss. So there you have it. That's how it went down. - Hm, okay. Assuming I believe you, which I'm not certain I really do. - It's hard to swallow, I admit. - What can we do? How can we put this to rest? - The derelict building at Lodger's Point. - Yeah? We chase partying kids from there twice a week. - That was their sanctuary. We must consecrate it so Messiah can never go in there again. - What do you mean? - We must bless it with the hand of God and make it pure again so he can never step foot in there, ever. - You sure about that? - Positive. - And what if we don't find him? - He'll find us. - It is not exactly known when Messiah Ward brought his cult to Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. Some estimates put his arrival at about a decade earlier. But other reports do claim that he placed his roots as early as the 1980s. Regardless, the Satanic church has valued their privacy, though some residents have feared rumors of strange cult activity in the surrounding area of woods. We'll keep you updated. - You might wanna slow it down a bit. I'd hate to have to write you a speeding ticket. - I thought your authority extended to the water only. - Just slow it down, okay? You just put in an Amazon order? - Our weapons. - Hm, I have my weapon right here. - That gun will do you no good. - What about the big cross? - That'll be our last resort. This will do in the meantime. We're gonna have to grab a few of these items. Holy water. Quickest and easiest way to drive away evil. Cross. Evil can't stand the sight of a cross. Take a few of these. - You're really serious. - You don't understand the magnitude of what is before us. I implore you, heed my words and stay strong. - Okay, okay, I'm with you. But if all else fails, I'm using my religion. - And like I said, it'll do you no good. - We'll see. The Brotherhood doesn't clean much, do they? You certainly know your way around here. - Please stop talking. This is the epicenter of evil, the sacrificial room of the Brotherhood of Darkness. Few have been here and lived to talk about it. - Well, it's not much to write home about either way. So do I just stand here and look pretty? - You're lucky you haven't been called upon to do anything, yet. - I don't like how you said that. - Oh Father in heaven, hear my prayer. I place myself at the foot of your cross and ask you to cover me with your precious blood which flows forth from your most sacred heart and from your most holy wounds. Cleanse me Jesus, in your most holy water. I ask you to surround me Lord Jesus, with your holy light. Heavenly Father, with the healing waters of my baptism, now flow back through the maternal and paternal generations to purify the evil line of Satan and sin. I come before you, Father, and I ask forgiveness for myself, my relatives, and my ancestors. For any powers that set themselves in opposition to you or that do not offer true honor to Lord Jesus Christ. I now reclaim any territory that was handed over to Satan and place it under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. By the power of your Holy Spirit, I bind all evil spirits of the air, water, ground, underground, and nether world. In the holy name of Jesus, I seal myself, my relatives, this building and all sources of supply in the precious love of Jesus Christ. In the holy name of Jesus I break and dissolve any and all curses, hexes, spells, snares, traps, lies, obstacles, deceptions, diversions, spiritual influences, evil wishes, evil desires, hereditary seals known and unknown, and every dysfunction and disease from any source including my mistakes and sins. I sever the transmission of any and all Satanic vows, pacts, spiritual bonds, soul ties, and satanic works. In Jesus' name, I break and dissolve any and all links and effects of links with the evil, Messiah Ward, his followers, and any blackness that lingers. I bind it. Make it so, amen. - That's it? I thought it would be more dramatic. - What the hell? - Hell is exactly what it is. - They don't die. - You can't kill what's already dead. - Now what? - We use God to help us. A little help here! Use the holy water! Do it! Use the holy water. We got one more task. Quickly. - You know, up until now, I thought you were full of crap, but now I'm inclined to believe you. - He won't be able to enter this structure anymore and defile it with his evil. - Hmm, this Messiah Ward. He sounds as if he isn't going to take this lightly. - Now he can only roam the lake waters. We've made a small victory, but he still has the upper hand. - I don't like how that sounds. What's wrong? He at least has to stick to the water. We'll have another chance. - Tired, my friend. - Well, this is what you were called to do, right? - At seminary we were taught about evil in it's basic form. But this evil is greater than any head diocese could bear to battle. - Can we get help from the church? You know, an army of spiritual warriors? - I'm afraid not. - Why? You guys do exorcisms and stuff like that. Why is this any different? - If I were, I'd have to reveal my actions, and that's an even greater evil in the church's eyes. - You did them a favor. - Murder is murder. There's no distinction in God's eyes. - Well, maybe you have God all wrong. - How so? - Maybe, just maybe, it was in his plans for you to be the advocate for good and erase this mess despite what you had to do. - You think it's God's plan I was supposed to murder Messiah Ward and his acolytes? - Hmm, erase, not murder, erase. - Maybe you should join the clergy. - Hmm, no. I swear too much and drink too much. - We all have our vices. Well, let's go. We'll be safe for now. - Now let's figure out our next move. Hey, easy on the the sauce, boss. - Another to clear my head. - And soak your soul. So now that the boating barbarian is relegated to the water, how do we send him to the bottom for good? - Send him to the bottom? - Well yes. Think of Messiah Ward as a vessel. How do you disable a vessel? You scuttle it or send it to the watery bottom. - Hmm, excellent thought. That'd make a good sermon. If you could scuttle a vessel, how would you do that? - Puncture its hull, burn it, blow it up. They all would work. - What, what if Messiah escaped, he didn't go downward the ship? - Possibly. Wait, when you put that cross on the door earlier, couldn't we do the same to Messiah Ward? - Latch a cross, a large one, to him and send him to the bottom? That could work. Embracing the sign of the cross, he would be put to the end. - He's not just going to let us tie a cross to him and dunk him in the lake. - No, but spontaneity is our upper hand. - Just like that, huh? - Have faith. - I think I'll have another drink instead. - Are we all set? - God be with us. - Let me guess. I don't even have to ask. He'll find us, we won't find him. - Precisely. Keep your eyes peeled. - Police are currently investigating reports of a black boat traveling at unsafe speeds in Ness Muck Lake. It is striper season here in lovely Wellsboro, and fishermen and women can be seen dotting the waterways in hopes of landing one of our prized fish. Please, you're doing any kind of recreational activity on the water, exercise caution and consideration for our local and visiting anglers. - Hey Radcliff, where are the sodas? What died in here? - Shut up, man. They're right there. Open up your eyes. - Oh, thanks. - Dude, it stinks. I'm going outside. - Hey, did you see that? - What? - A, a boat. - So what? A boat. - It just, it just... - Just what? - Jed, it just appeared like a mirage or something. - Yeah, that's it, Radcliff, mirage. - Well, I'm gonna go check it out. - Yeah, you do that. You just do that. I'm gonna rest right here. - Hello? Hey, is anyone in there? Hello in there. Anybody there? That ain't very neighborly like. Damn, that's hot! No, no! - Where'd that idiot get to? Oh. Idiot fell asleep. Better drag him back to shore before he washes out to see and drowns himself. Radcliff, get up, you idiot, before your sorry washes out into the lake and you drown. What the hell is that? Hey! Hey, slow down! - So why did you decide to eliminate the cult on your own? - No one was willing to help. - I know you said the diocese wouldn't assist, but what about local law enforcement? - Did it ever occur to you that maybe some of the high ranking officials were part of the Brotherhood of Darkness? - Yeah, that would explain all of the job vacancies a few years back. I still think what you did was right. Had I busted in there that night, I would've done the same. - Thanks, that's reassuring. I guess we'll figure it all out on the other side. - That's deep. What does it want? - Messiah Ward's challenging us. - Then let's catch his and send him to hell. It's disappeared. - He's lured us out into the middle of the lake. He has something planned. Stay alert. - The time has come. - Let's finish this. Come on, Messiah Ward! - Name of God, be gone! - It's over. - It appears it is. Latch him to me quickly! - But- - There's no other way! I'll see you on the other side. And you, you're going to hell! - You forgot these.
