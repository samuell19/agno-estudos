She, a woman of great beauty, of antique grace and raphaelic harmony, a woman, created like no other, to be Medea, Madonna, Beatrice, Iphigenia, Aspasia, decided one sunny winter day to leave LA ROTONDA. She bought a one-way ticket to Berlin-Tegel. Good morning, madam, can I help you? Good morning. I would like to have a seat reserved for the next possible flight to Berlin, please. One way or no return? One way — no return. One way — no return. She wanted to forget her past, rather leave it like a house to be demolished. To concentrate all her strength on one affair. Her affair. It was her desire to finally follow her destiny. Berlin, a city completely foreign to her, seemed to be the place to live out her passion. Her passion was to drink — live to drink — a drunken life — Life of a drunkard. Upon landing at Berlin-Tegel she's made a decision that was irrevocable. Thanks to a Berlin brochure, given to her by a friendly stewardess, she decided to set up a drinking schedule. The detailed description of a sightseeing tour gave her assistance and comprehensive help. She decided to do a sort of boozer's sightseeing. Briefly, sightseeing for her personal needs. Berlin seemed to be just right in a special way for her purpose. Her plans for a narcissistic worship of loneliness had become deepened on the short flight and intensified to the point where they enter a stage worthy of living, not to risk losing them in realms of phantasies. Now the time had come to make it all come true. Berlin-Tegel — Reality — Berlin-Tegel, please — Reality. Berlin welcome the ladies: Common Sense, Social Question, Exact Statistics. You are expected at the information desk. The three ladies, Common Sense, Exact Statistics and Social Question, please go to the information desk. Fucking pig! You knocked down all I own! Fucking bastard! Have you ever been told that you look like a flap-eared gawk? Got a moustache too, Mr. Schnauzer! You're arrogant too, Schnauzer, you're a swine! Ruined Everything! Shit! Please consider that fatal accidents caused by pedestrians under the influence of alcohol amounted to 14% in 1972 and at least 40% of all fatal road accidents were due to alcohol. A blessing in disguise! The taxi driver seems to be more like an unobtrusive drunkard. Schnauzer! What an asshole! Everything broken! Cheat! Crook! Madam? Ten marks only for the whole pack! 25, and once more... Ladies and gentlemen, baccara can begin. Please take your reserved seats. But consider, my dear, the emancipated woman is often insecure and more prone to alcohol. Let's keep to the statistics. This is an extrapolation... that was made during a survey in the Bremen area in 1973... She never shook hands, didn't say hello or goodbye, and she never seemed to hear "How do you do?" Berlin will always be Berlin. Take a city tour... I'll get your material in time. ... write postcards... What shall we have? Pepita? Yes, 3 Pepitas, please. To speak of damage from alcoholism of its various kinds in marks and pfennigs... It's a matter of values, not figures. ... is of special interest to us, because... public opinion is more impressed by figures. For the necessity of preventive or rehabilitating measures against alcohol abuse, it's insignificant, whether millions are affected or millions of marks are spent. The unknown quantity is also of importance. There are always errors in statistics. But 26%... Can't you forget figures for a moment and remember the congress in Kenya when the little blackmoor served us a huge banana ice cream shaped like a swan? The group of housewives without other work represents the majority of alcoholics with 39.2%. But amongst the chronic alcoholics there are many people with an unstable character that is more likely the cause of their behavior. In large cities the number of alcoholics is said to be 18 to 20%, for youngsters under 25 it is estimated at 8 to 9%. Critical milieu punishes the loss of self-control with social isolation. Women over 40 are particularly at risk. That's the menopause. There are no statistics of the money spent on social assistance. Statistics! Did you know that between New York and Moscow only 10% of the population is abstinent? Yes, unfortunately alcohol has become a status symbol. This one's good, madam. Cognac? It's good. ... the well-groomed lady partial to cognac... ... the ravages caused by chronic... That's tasty. It's my trolley, madam. Conflict situations and abnormal attitudes lead woman, more often than men, to inebriety. Unfortunately, there are no standardized statistics about the expenditures of public assistance. By the way, did you know that between Moscow and Los Angeles only 10% of the people are abstinent? Yes, alcoholism has become a status symbol. The way into an alcoholic subculture is treaded the moment the drunkard is thrilled by alcohol and tries to repeat this experience. ... brought about... Now, there it goes! Get out! Scram! Disgusting! Women getting drunk in public! People always want something better. They want to change us. But they didn't succeed, madam. You're so lovely, madam, I always have to say so. You're so lovely. If my poor mother knew, my poor mother. That I... here. You've got a nice place. You must be rich, madam. Madam... you know society... doesn't want us, madam. They drove us nuts because they don't want us. But I don't want them either, madam. Some vitamins, madam? I nearly choked. The wine tastes good, madam. Riesling... Late vintage. Oh God. What am I to do with it? Eat it? Oh God. They killed Marilyn too, madam. God, it's so beautiful here, madam. I'll move in. You're so kind to me. Why are you so kind? RICH FOREIGNER WENT BERSERK IN MÖHRING Better than Bahnhof Zoo? Is she afraid of spoiling her hairdo? I dare not do what you are doing, madam. I'm far too ugly. Never been pretty. I look quite different. Never been so pretty, madam. I always thought you didn't want me. I've never been so pretty, never, in all my life. I always had to push the trolley. Once I want to kick over the trace will you then be at that place? I want to drink and stay out of bed madly, with no regrets. Once to care no straw for the world... once to feel as if I'd been purled. Drink at a stretch, two times or three tell me, are you with me? I spent many times lots of taxi-dimes, drove along "Spree" river and right through the bandy lakes, hear the moneymeter sound see the driver count. I am here, yes, I'm here, I am here! Let's drink till late, let's jubilate! Gin, wine and brandy come in so handy. Late to bed and late to rise makes a woman drunk and wise! I stood in the snowfall drunk after all. I saw a taxi coming by and I shouted, gave it a try but it drove by. Left me standing in the snow. Then I was raped, but the police didn't believe me. The swine! The swine! These swine! They're all assholes! This squalor! Vodka Tamara, Vodka Natasha, peppermint liqueur... Cognac! Own brand. Well, personally I like to drink Meisterkorn and aquavit, they're good. I'd say super. Cognac, straight? No water, no soda, no ice? Cognac always without water, soda or ice. Cognac is always straight, miss. But I know lots of people who drink cognac with extras, with ice and soda. That's not right! Cognac always straight. Cheers! Well, I think egg flip or cherry brandy are also good drinks. I like to drink them. Well, OK. You've changed. Everybody does now and then. I drink all I can get. May I pass it over? Cheers!

Who's the lady? Have you also read Gertrude Stein, Eddie? Words... I think the ladies are lost. Abandoning closing time opens the door to vice. Berlin is known as a center of homosexuality. The homosexual subculture is basically a recreational pastime. The attitude towards them varies from place to place. In Bavaria every third person doesn't like homosexuals. In Hessen and Hamburg only 13 or 14%. How interesting. We still only know a little about it. Have they acquired femininity or masculinity or been born like it? I think that vivisection... Vivisection? ... would help us further. Right, Kinsey tell us that lesbian contacts have been observed amongst mice, rats, antelopes, mares, rabbits, hamsters, pigs, guinea-pigs... Do you want to dance? ... chimpanzees. To be, or not to be: that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles... What did they have in mind? The leading man is completely drunk. But it's a man part! It doesn't justify such a lack of discipline, especially in a classical play. ... and by a sleep to say we end the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation. Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream... Do you remember last May we had... the lamp... She's written small letters for the 5th time! What's that? What are you doing? That's for the customers only! Miss! We are a small but an old-established and respected, reliable firm. And the same sense of responsibility I have for my, for our firm, I demand from each employee. From you first of all. You're not only my secretary, you can't write anyway, but also the receptionist. You don't only have to look good, you've got to use your senses too. Assuming I'd visit you at home, if you have one, and I'd open the fridge, take out the wine and drink it. What would you call that? It's stealing. In this case stealing the firm's property. What do you say? Can't you defend yourself? You smell of the bottle! You're blind drunk! How many bottles do you drink? Stop it! Look at me! Listen to what I have to tell you. That you hang with your ass onto this chair, you owe to me. Without my power, my persistence and stability this firm wouldn't exist. I've had to forgo a lot to make this firm successful. Or do you think I had wine like this 20 years ago? I won't have my success destroyed by anyone. Least of all by you. Irresponsible drunkard! That's enough! That will do! Stop! Out! Out! Finish! Finito! Out! Get out! You're fired! No net and drunk as well! Here's a living example of how permanent disability arises from damage to people and property resulting in a financial loss of billions. We sociologists point out continuously that these factors are so important for the... If you want to recommend a top product to consumers, then strategic. Act strategic? Strategic advantages against competitors can be gained by: position, strength, time. Position. Strength. Time. The only way to get hold of the consumer. To build up and independent beverage brand you have to choose a name that the consumer connects with what he hasn't got. Harmony, love, security, and what he wants to achieve: success, superiority, exclusiveness. Harmony. Love. Security. Success. Superiority. Exclusiveness! Your drink, the aperitif, is that sweet reward which the individual allows himself after a long working day. My analysis of the elastic zones would recommend the following names for your product: To simplify matters we'll call the product X. These elastic associations enable the exactly determined consumer of your specific target group to retreat to an island of emotional safeness. The consumer has to be convinced by this action to succeed in reharmonising himself by your beverage. Reharmonising himself! The continuous trend to individualization within the exclusiveness of undisturbed harmony, is facilitated by your product and conveys safety and superiority in a private area. Private area? You have to tempt with romantic idylls, don't forget, exotic is far, your drink is near. Childhood dreams and flight into free time are the most important arguments of your campaign. Not pleasure gained by aggression but by regression. Pleasure gain? If you act like that and soften up the consumer, he'll feel appealed to and accept your drink as a substitute for love. Then we're already top. From now on the consumer will start to consume with cogency. Cogency? Cogency! Alcohol in this job... It had to end in tragedy. Meanwhile it's become obvious that alcohol causes more deaths and far more material damages than accidents without alcohol. Model 1001... Solid domed coffin. Of Oak. White and red gerbera... Decorative! Only when there's room... Or 451 E... Oak! Oak? And oak chest. Are other combinations possible? Cover of yellow tulips and fern? Or pansies... That's extra. Richly carved mahogany chest... Gothic. - Baroque! - Gothic! Model 250. This small centerpiece of red peonies. Peonies, depends on the season. Or plain layout. Laying out! The coffin must speak for itself. Decorated by tall vases! Copper vases. Laid out on palms. Laid out? The bouquet from the near relatives. Would enhance the noble line of the coffin. Or 452. Solid mahogany. Cyclam-colored orchids. Cyclamen colored! On request. Model Europe... - 240. - Empire-style. Timeless! Give me two... for the ladies. Madam... for you. Cheers, ladies. Welcome. That's very sensible. Your girlfriend... Two more quick ones. Is there a new supply? No, I'd rather not leave her alone. OK. Let's drink now, just you and me. My name's Willi. - I'm a director, Director Willi. - What of? Let's have a drink and then... I suggest we'll get... ... some fresh air. Us two beauties. Berlin air. Then we'll see what happens, perhaps we'll find places better than this one. We'll pay tomorrow. Bye, Karl. It's me, madam. I'm your only friend, madam. Stop that rubbish. Come on. You can't hurt me. It's so posh here, madam. Shouldn't we rather go back to my place, madam? Come on. She never shook hands. Never said hello or goodbye. She never seemed to hear "How do you do?" As far as I know drunkards they'd rather die than drink. Wondrous plan, to heighten a pleasure so that it leads to death. I recently spoke about it with Lipsky, he said: Our addictions are just the Erinyes in the theater of cruelty. I said: So we hate ourselves? Yes, he said, it's not that bad. I've a lot in common with Lipsky. His self-destruction is attitudinized. But who's capable of living otherwise than attitudinized? That attitude is already the severity. Even on the deathbed some believe themselves to be someone special, to have been someone special. That's when alcohol should be prescribed, I'm serious. Again I think of Lipsky. Laying on the floor of a station pissoir he said he regards his nervous system as a sort of accordion. Then the police came. I'm an inventor, Lipsky said, do you want to force me to emigrate? It's a real pity that you won't see the press conference, dear colleague, but... It's time to say goodbye. You tarts! You assholes! ... that amongst alcoholics there's statistic proof of excessive mortality. Even the suicide rate is higher than in the entire population, e.g. 12 times higher in Saxony, up to 75 times higher in England. Society tolerates no visible drinking effects on women. Due to the common moral principles that drunkenness of men in seen as masculine and therefore judged positively, whereas in women drunkenness is regarded as degrading and repulsive. No, no thanks. Have you got the "SPIEGEL"? The Ladies Journal please. He who awakes clear-minded and fit and says, I'm the most undesired man in the world, is ripe for boozing. He should dress, get on a bus, go into town. There he should go into a tavern, a bar or, as I've just seen in the movies, a beer eldorado. Everything else solves itself. Generally the best of drinking is: taking care of itself. Drinkers are travelers, who are being moved without moving. You pick them up and move them. You see the galaxy, I said. Drinkers ruin themselves, it's their self-sufficiency. Statistics prove that cultures under pressure to perform have a permanent increase of alcoholism. Believe me, today the socio-ceremonial function of alcohol is more than ever the center of interest. Earlier, the social control of aggressiveness took place by community-supporting and dept-relieving sacramental ceremonies. By giving alcohol a religious symbolism. In today's secularized society cocktail parties assume a similar function. Incidentally, our next congress "Mania and Abuse" in Copenhagen will be opened with a cocktail party. Quite right. Till then! I wish you a pleasant journey to... Bayrisch Eisenstein. That's it, goodbye. As you make your bed, so you must lie on it.
