You'll heal after poison is gone, your misery and curse will be gone. Thank you god, thank you. Remember not to drink cold water in the next 3 days. Not to lay with a woman in the next 7 weeks.

Hey... Mister... Hmm? The young lady of this house is a beauty to this village! She's kind and has a nice temper. Too bad I don't have that kind of luck... What do you mean? If I was 10 years older than her then everything would work out! Hey mister, my boss not only owns this hotel, but he also owns many companies! Oh? My service is the best here! Do you have any other requests? Nothing for now, you may leave. Umm... mister? Yes? Did you forget... this? Ohhh! Whoa... Thank you, thank you! - Hey, hey, hey. - How can I help you?

Miss, you shouldn't prune the flowers. What exactly do you mean? I planted these flowers. So please don't prune them without my permission. What are you talking about? Weirdo. I am just bored, that's why I'm looking for an excuse to talk to you. Are you angry? That's such an old line! Our lady doesn't like that kind of talk! Mr. go, you should try to say something new. So you saw everything? Duh! Of course! I noticed a few days ago that you're trying to approach her! - Oh? - Our lady has a lot of admirers. She's not that easy! Really? Yeah ding dong, tell me, what kind of bait should I use to get the fish? That depends on whether you place your fishing pole at the right place. Oh? I've never fished before. I don't know the methods. Can you please help me? Hey Mr. go, knowing you for a few days, I think you're a good guy. I think you're a good suiter for our lady. But regarding this request, it can be very easy. It can also be extremely difficult! I don't know what you mean. Ai-ya! What drives everything in this world? Ohhhhh... Here.. A little more please. Ding dong. What are you doing to me? How are you going to help me? Uhh... You don't have a plan to do you? It's okay. Uh, Mr. go, don't underestimate me. Just wait for my good news later! No problem... okay! Ding dong, where are you going? I'm going out for a bit. Hey, you should be working instead of messing around outside! Ouch! Brother ahjol, uh.. No. I mean, vice manager. I'm going to the boss's house to keep the lady of the house company. What? Ding dong! Did I hurt your head? No you didn't. You are such a clever boy! Think of a way for me to have an opportunity. What opportunity. Umm... like for me to invite her out for a date. Or go watch a movie... Or... oh right! I can ask her to watch a movie, tell you. Then give you the opportunity. Wow for real? Thanks buddy! You're welcome! - Huh? - Money for the movie ticket? Ahhh! Clever boy! Here, keep the change! Thank you, sir! Good morning, mister! You're going out? Take care. - Hi! - What is it?

There's a demon! Lu, go get a doctor! Hold on a minute, boss, that's not a good idea! If people know our hotel is haunted, then nobody will dare stay here. Umm... that's... Daddy, stop hesitating, hurry and think of a way! Miss, we have plenty spare rooms in the house. Why don't we take him to the house to recover, what do you think? Boss, what do you say? Where have you been? Something happened and there was no manager around! Uh, I had to go do something. Uncle, what happened upstairs? The guest in room 16 is sick, I told lu and bell to send him to the house. The guy named go... - Moved him to deng's house? - Yeah. Mom, I think that go is a deviant. Cousin shueh li fell for him in just a few days. I think he probably used some kind of evil spell. Don't slander people like that. Maybe, they really developed feelings. Feelings?! That's impossible! Ma... I heard there is this one kind of witchcraft... You right, there is a kind like that... People under this kind of spell... Their life is not threatened. But, their conscious is fuzzy, they hallucinate... Often they do things they don't intend to do, fall in love with people they dislike, so... Yes! Cousin must be under this kind of spell! What nonsense are you saying? It's not nonsense. Must be go doing something suspicious! If you don't believe me, I'll show you tomorrow! You're awake. Drink this while it's hot. Sure. Thank you for taking care of me. Shueh li... The first time I laid eyes on you, I fell for you. Mr. go... Call me baoshen. I told you they really like each other! You wouldn't believe me. Now you've seen it with your own eyes! Come here... Yo! How dare you lay together under broad daylight! Aren't you afraid of upsetting my boss here? Ding dong... Mr. go, are you taking a liking to our young lady of the house? Yes. You do? Ms. shueh li, do you like Mr. go? Don't be shy! Me and boss man saw everything! Right? If you're truly in love, boss man will surely agree to this. Boss, what do you say? Huh? You agree? Yes! You agree! Yes! Hey congrats! Good for you, congrats! Wonderful, the boss man agrees! Heh? What? Match making, I deserve a reward! Get back to work! Shueh li... Sir, third auntie and her son is here to see you. Okay, Mr. go, shueh li, come with me please. Shueh li, you have great taste. Third sister, it's the perfect time for you to visit. I was thinking about planning a wedding for them. I see! Can I trouble you to pick an auspicious date? Baosheng, will you marry shueh li?

Hey mister, his name is go, not zhao tingsheng. I didn't get the wrong person, he is zhao tingsheng. He took my sister's virginity. Now my sister has disappeared! Zhao tingsheng, where is fang shaojen? Sir... You're mistaken. My name is not zhao. Stop pretending! Sir, his name is go, why do you insist he tricked your sister? It's none of your business! You crazy person! How many times do I have to tell you before you get it? What?! Let go of me! Baosheng, did he really make a mistake? Shueh li, do you really think I'm the kind of person he said? Baosheng... Today is a great day, how did we end up with a mad man like this? Let's get out of here. You're crazy dude! Let go! Zhao tingsheng, I will uncover your lies! Shueh li! What's going on? Shueh li? Shueh li, there's nothing. I really saw a ghost! With long hair and a white robe... Don't be scared, maybe you're too tired from today. - But I really saw it with my own eyes. - Shueh li, I'm here, don't be scared. Ahhhh... Hey! Hey! An auspicious day turned into misfortune. Baosheng is gone for the whole night, no idea where he is. How can I not worry about this? Baosheng! - Baosheng, are you okay? - Mhmm. Baosheng, what exactly happened? Dad, ll... What did you see last night? Oh... just a crazy person. Shueh li, you look like you haven't slept. I've been worried to death, how could I have slept? Go get some rest please. You haven't slept either. Uh, since everything is fine, why don't you both get some rest? Excuse me, that's private property, you cannot enter. I'm going to look for zhao tingsheng. Stop! We told you many times he is not, why are you still here! What? You are unreasonable and you hit me?! Lul lu! Somebody come help! You tell zhao tingsheng, if I find him, I'll kill him! I won't let you go that easy. Ding dong! Ding dong! This way please... What the crap? Damn it! It's just one night shift and you're sleeping on the job. Any new guests? - Nope. - No? Okay. Hey, my room key. I'm going to bed now. Ahhhhhhh!! Lu, hurry and go get boss! Red bumps all over him, he kept screaming, it was so eerie. Boss! Daddy, hurry! He's right in front! Stop! Don't come near! Ding dong, go get some men and tie him up! Yes ma'am! Quick! Tie him up! Third auntie, is he under some kind of curse? Can we still save him? It's too late, he's under a tame head curse. If you get bit by him, you will catch the curse, too! Pull harder! Third sis, can we save him? There's nothing I can do, the one who set the curse is too vicious. What are you going to do with him? Burn him! Be careful! Hurry up! Burn him! Burn him! Shueh li, shueh li, what's wrong with this man? He's under a tame head curse, auntie said to burn him. Baosheng, daddy, can we please go back? What are you yelling about? Ding dong, you scared the crap out of me! Boss told me to give you these snacks. And here's a little liquid courage for ya! It's Mel Stop messing with Mel what... did you see just now? Nothing. You little shit! You dare trick me?! Look out it's a ghost! You little shit! Damn you! Ahhhhhhh! Shueh li. - Shueh li? - Yes, daddy? Where's baosheng? He's outside. What's going on? Baosheng. Baosheng! Stop yelling man, what is it? You've only been doing the books for 2 weeks. How can we be losing so much money? Hey... Hey, I've never managed a business before. I've never done the books, of course the numbers might be off! You're arguing with me? Gu... baosheng! Shueh li... How do you fall for a guy like this? Baosheng... You've changed. Say what you want! From now on, don't ask me to do your books! Gu baosheng! You're not a man! You... Daddy! What's wrong? Please sit down! Daddy! Daddy! Baosheng, you know daddy has a heart condition why did you treat him like that? Where did you go last night? You've changed so quickly... Hey... Are you done talking? Baosheng, what did my dad and I ever do to you? If you made a mistake with the numbers, just be honest with dad. He will surely forgive you. What the hell are you mumbling about? Baosheng... Get the fuck away! Cousin! Hey go! “Unmarried man and woman shall not touch', she is my wife you know. You are a vicious bully! How dare you talk to me, this is a matter inside my house. It's none of your business. She's my cousin, I can't let you do this to her. She's my wife, I do what I want with her. Get inside! What do you want? Asshole! Cousin, cousin please... I knew long ago that you were rotten... Whatever you wanna say. Shueh li, come here! Gu baosheng, you're evil! You even had me fooled! Get the hell inside! Get out of my house. Gu baosheng, let me tell you... I will not let you off easy! Sir, if you don't intend to stay, why are you looking in here? Kid, how is business usually? Pretty good, why do you wanna know? Who said I'm selling the hotel? Ding dong told me just now. What is going on? This morning a man said we are selling the hotel to them, so... Weird... What is there to wonder, must be that bastard who sold it. What about me? Lu ahjol, are you trying to create conflict again? Did you try to sell our hotel? Oh, I was just thinking for you... You're getting older, why not sell the hotel and enjoy life? Bullshit! Don't you dare touch my property! Get out, get out of my sight! Get out? “It easy to bring the Buddha in, harder to send it away.” What? Old man, you want to split half of your property with me? I've been so blind! Piss off! What are you doing? If you touch him again, I won't hold back huh? Boss, it's all my fault... I shouldn't have introduced him to our miss. I was so blind, I was so blind! Old man, to tell you the truth... I already gave property contract to the buyer. And... I already took part of the payment. You... You stole the contract from my safety vault? Huh? Stole? Don't make it sound so bad. I'm your son-in-law, you should say, took... Gu baosheng! Gu... Uncle! Uncle! Boss! Boss! Baosheng? - Uncle! Uncle! - Boss! Boss! It's all my fault that you're dead! Daddy! Mom! Haven't I warned you before? Why are you here?! I must avenge uncle! This jerk tricked shueh li, he ruined the whole family! I want him dead! Using a tame head curse! I'd never let you use witchcraft to harm others! I learned the tame head curse to save lives. Mom, we can't sit here and watch that bastard do what he wants. The heaven is watching, evil people will get what they deserve. There will be a fair ending to this all. Daddy! Boss... Auntie... auntie! Cousin... Third auntie... Boss is dead because of me. This is all my fault, all my fault. I should be dead! I'm so stupid! I should be dead! Third auntie... you must avenge boss, you must, please! Third auntie! Young master, you must get revenge for uncle, you must! My lady... please forgive me. I... I will never blame you. This is a farewell calligraphy sent by a friend. (“Man with no moral, bullies weak woman, not even the heaven will forgive him, Who sent this?! A woman in a veil. - Where is she? - She left. Mom, there needs to be an end to this evil man. I want to avenge uncle, put a curse on him! Third auntie... I beg of you, you must avenge uncle, give him what he deserves. Auntie, I brought this misfortune, please forgive baosheng. Cousin! Why are you still protecting him?! L... Mighty snake god, the man named go baosheng, has done many evil deeds... Led to other's death, he shall not be forgiven, allow me this one exception. So I can administer justice for the heaven, take out this evil. What took you so long to make food? Shueh li... Cousin? What are you doing here so late? I'm going to kill go baosheng. I'm going to get revenge for uncle! No! - No, no... - Shueh li. This is the tame head serum I got from mom, make him drink this. The poison is lethal, he will be dead. - Shueh li, give this to Mel - Cousin, no, no, please no! Give it to me! Cousin... I don't want this to happen... We are giving him a taste of his own medicine. He fooled you, killed your father, and fang hao, and who knows how many other innocent people... An evil man like him, this is what he deserves. Cousin, I... Shueh li, are you dead in the kitchen? I'll be right there. - No... - Shueh li, take this. Take this! Take it. He killed your father. Take it. What the hell? I'm starving! Make a bowl for Mel! This... - This porridge... - Okay, enough! Get outta here! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy... daddy... Cousin, this man is an evil beast, he's not worth being sad over! This is what he deserves. Fang shaojen! Ahhh! Master, I... I'm poisoned by the tame head curse. Master, please save me... This particular curse is the most vicious, I cant save you. I don't believe that, if you know how to set one you know how to take it away! Thinking of a way to save me! It wasn't me who set this curse, you have to find the one who did to save you. No! You must save me! I really cannot save you. Hey... what are you doing? You... you... Ahhhhhh! Ahhhh! Gu baosheng was zhao tingsheng after all, he tricked and killed fang shaojen and then he purchased some tame head curses from a witch doctor mom, why did he do all that? To use the curses to kill off any leads to his crimes. Mom, how did you know all this? When shueh li's dad died, you all begged me to put a curse on zhao... At that moment I was hesitant, however that night, fang shaojen came to me, and told me everything. Isn't fang shaojen dead? She didn't die, she lost consciousness after being hit on the head. After I heard all the crimes zhao did, I decided to give the curse to ahjol. This devil, he deserves this! Auntie, is she fang shaojen? Fang shaojen, I broke my practice to set this curse, it's a deep sin. Please recite more Buddha's scripture for me daily.
