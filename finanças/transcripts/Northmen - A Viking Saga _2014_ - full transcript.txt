Man: Make no tent on thy ship, never sleep in a house, for a foe within doors you may view. On his shield sleeps the Viking, his sword in his hand, and his tent is the heavenly blue. When the storm rageth fierce... hoist the sail to the top. Oh, how merry the Storm-king appears. Let her drive. Let her drive. Better founder than strike... for who strikes is a slave to his fears. (wood creaking) - (groans) - (wood creaking) (screams) (wind blowing) (grunting) The sail! Gunnar! (grunting) (groans) (screams) (seagulls crying, waves crashing) (seagulls crying, waves crashing) Come on, boy. Wake up! (coughs) Man: Where are we? Gunnar: It's not Lindisfarne, that's for sure. Behind enemy lines, behind friendly lines. What friendly lines? Eh, come on. (coughing) My runes will protect you on your journey, my friend. What are you doing? He needs them more than I do. What happens when you die? Then I will be dead. All right, men. Our raid on Lindisfarne must wait. First, we have to get off this coast. We don't even know where we are. Man: Well, down here we'll drown. But that's madness. I'm a warrior, not a climber. You heard the man. Your father would be so proud of you. (scoffs) Leave him. We're going to need every man. (grunting) (screaming) (groaning) (man coughing) Asbjorn. (horse whinnies) (man yelling in distance) - Hold! - (horse whinnies) Hold your lines! (Viking laughs) That's a friendly welcome. What did you expect? Meeting woman folk? - Man: Archers! - (horse whinnies) It's them or us. Man: Archers, on the ready! Spread out. Use whatever you can and make it count. (shouting) To Valhalla! Asbjorn! (yelling) (both grunting) (growls) Valli! (screams) (gurgles) (yelling) (yelling) Won't take him long to get reinforcements. (groaning) Your brother waits for us in Valhalla. Asbjorn, come here! He comes with us. Asbjorn, you must leave me here. He's right. He will only delay us. No one still alive gets left behind. Help him. Get off. As you wish, helmsman. (groans) Get up. What have we here? (flies buzzing) Open it. (screams) (laughter) What a pretty bird you freed. Who are you and why were you locked in this wagon? (speaks native language) Scottish. I thought so. - Scotland. - (groans) So further from home than we thought. Where they eat little Northmen like you for breakfast. We better get out of here. Our nearest settlement must be to the south. Two, maybe three days. Asbjorn: They'll never let us in empty-handed. We are not empty-handed. Look at the brooch... and the golden embroidery on her dress. This is a special kind of bird. And special birds are worth a special bounty. - Enough to pay for all our heads? - For sure. Am I right? Jorund, take your hands away. Jorund! Take your hands away. You are not under King Harald's command any more. (sniffs) Aye-aye... helmsman. I would not get too near, if I were you. (laughter) If you can understand me, I need you to come with us. If you behave yours-- - (laughter) - (woman squeals) Hmm. If you behave yourself, nothing will happen to you. When your people pay your ransom, you will be free. - My word for it. - (groaning) We probably have one or two days at the most before they come. Before who comes? Do you really think nobody will miss this woman? Believe me, someone is coming. (laughter) (chattering) Bride's messenger is nearing the gate. Good. You look distracted. No cause for concern, I hope. Giving away my only child? It's a marked day for any man. - Man: The king! - Man #2: Quiet. The king. Unleash the great fire. (cheering) We are gathered tonight to celebrate the union of my daughter, the Lady Inghean, with clan Lord Murdill. For them the great fire shall burn until-- (horse neighs) - My king. - Speak, man. - We were attacked by Vikings. - (crowd gasps) - They've taken her prisoner, my king. - (gasping) Bovarr! No, my king-- Rise. Tell me, how is it possible that twenty of the king's best men lose his daughter to few common Northmen? We discovered them climbing the cliffs. There were at least a dozen of them. Now they caught Lady Inghean and you are still free. Do you think this is just? My king-- no! No, wait! (screaming) Was that really necessary, mercenary? It will serve as lesson to your overzealous subjects not to act without due thought and deliberation. But can't question a dead man, now can you? We know everything we need to know. Your daughter is in the hands of few Vikings who obviously stranded. Otherwise, they wouldn't have climbed up the cliffs. They handle their weapons well enough to beat your warriors. They need not look twice to see she is worth a... considerable ransom. You bring my daughter back to me alive and I'll award you handsomely. If it is not possible to free her, you know what to do. Inghean can consider herself lucky to have such a responsible father. How dare you. If my enemies see that a bunch of Vikings could press gold from a king, how long do you think it'll be before every clan lord rises up against me? And I will not forget your impertinence. You'd better not forget who helped crush your enemies, my king. Little brother... (mercenary laughs) We leave at once. Inghean: You will all die. Either I learned Scottish or this little bird is tweeting our language. Let me go and you'll save your lives. Listen, birdie. If we let you go, we do not get the ransom. Without the ransom, we cannot buy our freedom. (groaning) Man: How's Bjorn? (gasping) Bjorn... - You should leave me behind. - Shh. No. We need to find a healer. Otherwise, he has no chance. Wolves... - we have a bounty to collect. - (all grunt) - Let's go hunting. - (cheering) (falcon cries) (falcon cries) We are not going to find a healer here. What happened here? (horses neigh, swords clinking, screaming echoing) - No. - (screams echoing) What was that? So now birdie thinks she's a soothsayer. - Get your hands off me! - Jorund! (whimpering) You are under my command, hird! What did you call me? Asbjorn: You heard me. So what are you going to do? Your father would never have got us in this mess. My father is dead and you're under my command now. So either you continues with us, or you are free to go alone. Hey! (gasps) Come here. - Don't do this again. - Or what? You'll not kill me. Dead, I'm not worthless to you. True, but wounded by an arrow, your family will still pay the full price. Who are you? Man: Since this is obviously not your land, I shall ask you first. I am Asbjorn, son of Egill. And tell me Asbjorn, son of Egill, what do you and your flock seek in this part of the country? The people are poor, there are no monasteries to raid. Oh, there are still some tongues to be cut out. We need to find a healer for our wounded friend here, Christian monk. He will not last a day. He needs shelter. This is not a good place. - (clatter) - What was that? (gasps) One false move and the pretty dies. Release her, she's mine. (laughs) Pretty. Drop your weapons! Drop it! Drop them. Move back. Back! Your keen archer. Drop it now. Thorald? Let go. (shouting) Back away! Run! - Not bad for peace-loving monk. - Yeah, he's pretty good. You may find shelter this way. - And why should we trust you? - You do not have to. Lay your wounded comrade there. And get the fire started. (groaning) Enough weapons to wage war against the whole of Britain. The weapons are all that's left of men whom, like you, confronted me. Yeah, right. Oh. Hold him. (screams) Don't fight it. That is all I can do for now. You may shelter here until dawn. We stay here tonight so that Bjorn can regain his strength. Then we'll continue. Make no tent on thy ship, never sleep in a house... for a foe within doors you may view. - I know. - I don't trust Christians. They pray peace, yet rule with the sword. I take the first watch. As soon as they know we are after them, they'll just kill her and leave her behind. And who says we want to bring her back alive? Dunchaid is an old man. Have you considered what will happen to us when Inghean and her new husband succeed him? That's why we cannot bring her back alive. The reward will still be large enough. I'll tell to men tomorrow it was the King's decision to murder his daughter. (laughs) Then He said, "Come to me all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens and I will give you rest." - Who said that? - The son of God. The man who died on the cross? - See it as a symbol. - The way I see it, is that your god is weak and our gods are strong, so... Hmm. What brings you to this land, Northman? We were banished from our homeland. Then our ship foundered off the coast not far from here. Now we have to buy our way into one of the Viking settlements in the south. So your plan is to get the bounty for your prisoner. You're not that dumb for a Christian. And you are not that clever for a pagan. Do you have any idea who she is? Of noble birth? - Perhaps a daughter of a-- - King? Yes, you fools have captured Lady Inghean, daughter of King Dunchaid. Good. Now we can command a bigger bounty. There will be no bounty in hell, because that's exactly where he will send your all. You will leave in the morning, so do try to get some sleep. Only a rested Northman can plunder and raid. (shouts) (laughs) I have nothing! I know nothing! Did we ask you yet? In the direction you came from perhaps you saw few Northmen? If I tell, will I be let go? (laughs) (screams) The loch by the Auldran Tower. That's where we found them, but we were defeated. The cursed monk, he got most of us. - And did they have a girl with them? - Aye... but they're at the end of their strength. Perhaps the monk took then with him up in his tower. Well, perhaps, indeed.

He's certainly capable of paying for you. Your father isn't the first king I've dealt with. ♪ I found the beast down in the wood ♪ ♪ And now I drink the monster's blood ♪ (vocalizing) Asbjorn, come and drink with us. And I thought you didn't trust the monk. We don't, but he has mead. You gave them mead? They did not ask. Gather your weapons. We leave today. Little bird. Still with us? Save your breath... for you'll need it when you enter your Valhalla. (coughing) I've been on many conquests, heard many beliefs. Why should ours be true? Why not? Why not, indeed? So you are outlaws? Yes, we are the last of them. The last not yet under King Harald the Finehair's reign. See, when Harald conquered Thor, my father didn't give up like the others. He fought. When he was murdered, I took his ship and what was left of our men and we left home. And now the king has put the price your heads? Yes. And what will you do with the woman when King Dunchaid does not pay? What kind of father would not? Give me your word that you will not touch a hair of that girl. And why do you care? Don't believe the rumors. Not all of us pagans are that bad. Hmm. From the fury of the Northmen, release us. May Bjorn, son of Olvar, be already on his way to Valhalla. We shall meet there, my friend. Where are we going now? (hoofbeats, shouting) - Into the tower! - We'd be trapped inside. Then die out here. - Ln! In! - No! "If I be a man of God," said Elijah the prophet to the captain and his fifty men... What is that crazy monk up to? "...then let fire burn down from heaven and consume thee!" (laughs) That will hold them for a while. (mercenaries chanting) (grunting) Men! (thud) Bring in him. Put him out! (moaning) (screaming) Who are you? We came for her. Her loving father ordered us to kill her. You're lying. You're lying! Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth! No! (blade rings) This does indeed not look like a rescue mission. We have to get out of here. Thanks to this monk, we're trapped. Oh, ye of little faith. (crash) Get as many weapons as you can carry. Come on. Follow me. Not much of a choice now. I need to see their bodies. Where are they? Clever. So what you know of our pursuers? We have to know who our enemies are. You should be feeling honored. He sent his best men on the hunt. His wolfpack. They're said to come from the wild mountainous region somewhere far in the east-- the Carpathians. Gunnar: And still just a bunch of murderers. But if it were up to me, they would never have set foot on our land. And if it were up to me, you would stay here and out of our way, birdie. She is useless. Her father will not pay for her. He wants her dead. Let's just hand her over to these mercenaries, then at least we have a chance of making out of this country. Jorund, are you really that stupid? Perhaps her father will not pay, but any of his enemies certainly will. Now, move. Where are you taking us, monk? Have patience. What does it mean? It tells of the Path of the Serpent, the ancient Pictish route to the south. - To the Danelaw. - The Danelaw? What's that? A town? What? It's not a town, but a group of Viking settlements where we can find safety. What are these? Boats? Your knife? This is the coastline. That was my tower. The highlands, the moor, the Danelaw. - That simple? - That simple, except for here... where King Dunchaid still has a line of fortifications. Then we break through them. Not even your great army was able to, but there's another way. With a boat, as in the painting, we can sail around the fortifications. Hold it. So now we're being led by a monk? Who's to say he's not luring us into a trap? He's not leading you. I say we have no other option than to accept his help. Asbjorn, the monk's not one of us. He's a Christian. You should think again. Who gave us a shelter, hmm? Who helped us to escape? If he wanted us dead or caught, he's had opportunity enough. Your decision, but I... shall have my eye on this monk. The Path of the Serpent. The Picts used it for scouting and hunting. It goes across the entire highlands and ends down at the sea. And that's where the boats are hidden, in openings in the cliffs. But in the next full moon the winter storms begin and the openings will be flooded until spring. That's only in a few days time. One moment. What's in it for you, monk? Thanks to you I also have to reach safe haven. Another reason would be a big bounty for some Vikings. - You're one to talk out. - Inghean: Stop it, all of you. You have no idea what you are up against. The more time we waste the closer the Wolves come. They come on horseback. As soon as they pick up our trail, they'll catch us. You should listen to you prisoner. We have to slow them down. (falcon cries) That way. Wait. What if it's an ambush? So what if it's an ambush? Let's go. (horses shrieking) (screaming in distance) (laughs) - Little brother. - Mount up. What about the wounded? We move on. (growls) - Mount up! - Man: All right, come on! They're already coming. And why should we believe you? I see what the land reveals to me. - Of course you do! - Asbjorn: Enough. - Let's keep moving. - Yes. On horses they will be upon us in no time. We need to catch them before the waterfall. Move! We won't make it! Thorald. (screams) Almost there! Come on! We will make it. (falcon cries) (screams) - Inghean. - (moans) Are you injured? - I don't think so. - Keep going! - We have to go, now. - You came back for me. (scuffling) You keep your puppies well-leashed. (laughs) And yours have left you all alone. (laughs) Lady Inghean, your father is concerned about you. Now hand her over. So be it, Northman. (screams) - We must follow them now. - No! We wait. - So we made it. - Not so fast. We need to find a way of stopping them here or we can forget about reaching those boats. Thorald, stay here and watch out for the Wolves. Everyone else, follow me. We have work to do. One man is guarding the path. The archer. - This is a Viking sword. - It is. I always had the feeling it was waiting for someone. Either one of my splinters shall slay my opponent. Hail mighty Tyr. I pledge to walk unswerving through fire and blood and steel. - Will your gods help? - They will. Sure, as always. I know Tyr will help us. I personally believe in more earthbound help. - And this will work? - (laughs) Nice. You're early. Take your rest. I'll keep watch. And I hope they try. It seems someone's crazy for Valhalla. (chuckles) So, uh... this is how you Christians pray, is it? I preach His word any way I can. But it will take more than prayer to vanquish Dunchaid's men. One day I was ordered to the most dangerous place for man of God-- the land of the Picts. But not only was I able to win their trust, they accepted me as one of their own without bloodshed. King Dunchaid was at war with the Picts. In order to put an end to bloodshed he asked me to mediate. So... I persuaded the leaders to attend a meeting with the king. Dunchaid had all the leaders killed... and anyone left was enslaved. - You couldn't have known. - I should have known. I should have saved them, but I failed. I retreated from my order to a life of solitude. "God settles the solitary in a home, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land." Seeing as you're with us now... can a monk be rebellious? Can a Viking not? We shall never make it. (sighs) Will the sun ever rise and set again without you complaining like a fishwife, hird? Skald, if you call me that name one more time... - Then what? - Asbjorn: Enough. The Wolves are enough for us to fight. Rest now. We move at first light. What's a hird? The hirds are King Harald's bodyguards. Jorund was one of them. That was until King Harald set them upon everyone who disagreed with him. You mean men like you? Jorund became an outlaw and fought with me and my father. After our defeat, he fled with us. So you're not even welcome amongst your own? Just like you. Tonight should've been my wedding night. Don't worry, my heart isn't broken. It was a profitable move for my father. That explains why you were locked in the wagon. I can't imagine you as a loving wife. Quiet and obedient. Well... I'll take that as a compliment. (owl hoots) (owl hoots) (owl hoots) (squelch) (snoring) - (whispers echoing) - (whimpering) (falcon cries) (growls) They're here! Haldor? Where is Haldor? Where is Haldor? - Grim. - Haldor! Haldor! We cannot leave him! When you take your revenge, Haldor will be smiling down on you, but not now, not here! Look out! (groaning) (groaning) No! (screaming) Eyes open. (screams) (falcon crying) (growling) Run. Asbjorn: Now what? You're welcome to swim, but I'll be crossing on that. Northmen! I will hold him up. For Haldor. We will. - The rest of you, over the bridge. - You heard the man. Take care of Inghean, my friend, and defend that bridge. Vikings, show no mercy. Asbjorn, you made the right decision about that monk. He is not so bad, for a Christian. You know, it would be quicker to just jump in the ravine. Jorund, go. Come on! Vikings. Vikings. (growls) (growling) Gunnar. Gunnar: Yeah! - Come on! - (howling) Make haste. You'll lie dead here! Whoa! Right there! Go to sleep, little doggies. - Gunnar! To the bridge! - Yeah! (screaming) Asbjorn! - (grunts) - No! Grim! No! Gunnar! (screaming) Asbjorn: No! Start cutting the bridge! (grunts) (grunting) (growls) This was just the beginning, Northmen. (panting) We have to go on. It should have been me. It should have been me. It was my time. Hjorr, come here. There's a path. (Bovarr howls) (Asbjorn groans) - That has to come out. - It's fine. Do you want to go to the Danelaw or to your Valhalla? (groans) Wait! What are you doing? Against gangrene. (falcon cries) (horse whinnies) Skald, if you continue with this pace, we should still be here for Ragnarok. The coast. - We're not there yet. - Ugh. - (gasps) - Wait! What is it? I'm not sure. Inghean, I believe in what you see. (hoofbeats echoing) What do you see? Inghean... They're coming. On horseback. Then let's stand and fight them right here. This is no place to fight them. There has to be another way. Monk: The boats are not much further. We can still get there. That's the only hope. Then let's go. Come on. The moor will be their grave. (falcon cries) (falcon cries) (falcon cries) No more running. Here. Vikings! (screams) Thorald, wait. Thorald. (screaming) Asbjorn! (screams) (laughs) How many times do we have to kill you, Northman? At least one more time, mercenary! No! You're coming with me, Northman. (screaming) I'm sorry. Thorald. When the storm rageth fierce, hoist the sail to the top. Oh, how merry the Storm-king appears. - Let her drive. - Let her drive. Better founder than strike. For who strikes-- Is a slave... (gurgles) Be on your way. We're too late. The boats are in those caves. The openings are already under water. Why am I not even surprised? (shouting in distance) (shouting continues) (growls) So what's the plan? No more talking. Let's fight them. Come on! Man: Forward, men! Man #2: Advance! - Man: Steady. - Man #2: Steady! No! - Man: Charge! - (shouting) We can take them. Come on! - Gunnar, you'll die in vain! - No, I die in battle! Look! Asbjorn! (screaming) And now, my King? Man: Archers! - Take aim! - (growls) - Gunnar! - I'll fight! - Gunnar, he has the boat. - No, I fight! (screaming) I thought we'd lost you. Jorund: Asbjorn! (grunting) (laughing) Not bad. Not bad at all... helmsman. Let's get off this coast.
