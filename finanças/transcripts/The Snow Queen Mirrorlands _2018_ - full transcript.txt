Your dad Your Dad is a Genius Yeah , Like magic Magic? No no this isn't magic This is science OK? It's the science which makes the world a better place Look magic is bad like Evil , Deep dark evil The kind of nearly killed us But not all magicians are evil like the snow queen There's good magicians in fairy tales No ? Sorry dear You told me fairy tales? Don't waste your time on nonsense Son Go to the library and get the "Fun Mathematics" instead That's a good book to read Your Majesty , The magic Artifact has been delivered , Right from the snow queen's castle ruins Finally You should remember , A royal guard's duty is to protect not to... You hide yourself behind the king Why you don't remember , An artist's duty is to paint right... Not like this Kai , Kai How did you know that I'm here? How's the barber's portrait going? -Hey -Hey Alfida Kai , Dad's calling you for dinner If your dear brother keeps drawing like this.. The only ones who'll have dinner with him would be his parents It's the modern art Maybe I missed up but just a little If you'll see what I draw tomorrow.. You'll be begging me to invite you for dinner Silly boy , Why he has to draw a portrait to invite me for dinner ? Your majesty listen to your court magician This is the cursed portal of Gerda We must destroy it immediately Gerda , She's famous Written in Trolls language It's written that "The gate is to exile the evil... That magic brought to common people That's where it must be set The mirrorlands will let you in If you have magic gifts within And that will be your end" This Gate leads to the mirrorlands To the snow queen But there's no way back It's a one way ticket I know the Trolls language And that's the exact reason you're here Why? Cause I need to know for sure.. that anyone can escape from there But there's no way back No one but the snow queen deserves such a punishment No magicians are better than her -Admiral -Yes your majesty Could you help our magician to the portal here ? Copy that your majesty No No please No Dad would he ever come back ? I hope not I'm responsible for your future No no please stop I don't wanna go there He's not back Evil feeds upon Evil Andreas He deserves this Today is a great day Once , the magic nearly killed us Finally It's exiling Now it's time for science and education -Tell them Keep eye on it -Keep eye on it Follow my order I need all the magicians here Could you believe it ? 10 Dinars Just right after I gave it to Gerda I guess it was just pure luck Not pure luck I feel everything is going to get better It seems people really need magic stuffs Specially when you put your heart and soul on it You'll see , When Kai finishes the portrait of the barber , He'll pay Kai good How's the barber's portrait going anyway?
