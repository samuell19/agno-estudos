The Last Bath Oh girl Rita? What are you doing up here? Go downstairs! Sorry, sister. Glad I see you! I already left you the flowers there. Everything is there. - Is everything on the altar? - Yes yes, I left it as you asked. So girls... Go! To have lunch. The van is not supposed to be waiting for you, like yesterday. Andor! Girl, you've been here for half an hour. Come on. Hurry up. Wherever I do it. go down there and in front of the altar you already have everything to make the arrangement. And it is: one, three, five. And those little leaves all around the vase. - One, three, five... - One, three, five... And make it quick so we can go to lunch, It's okay? It's okay. Sister Josephine, you have a call. It must be Lourdes. Tell him I'll call him back, okay? It's not Lourdes, it's from outside. - It's okay. - See you then. See you soon. Look, unfortunately I don't bring you good news. Yea? Your dad was sick for some time, and... Look, Josefina, your daddy passed away today. - It was his nephew, Alexandre, who found him in bed. Father Manuel has already taken care of everything. The funeral will be tomorrow. Yes. Alexandre is here with me. He can't be alone in that house, can he? Poor little thing... He turned fifteen last week... He's still very cute. It is my sister? Angela? No one has yet talk to her. friends and companions flee from my disgrace. My relatives are far away. Those who seek to take my life they set up traps. My God, acknowledge my guilt. Do not abandon me, Lord my salvation. God our Father, you rightly condemned sinful man and you promised her life by penance and the final resurrection; we humbly beg you to deign to bless this grave while your servant's body descends to the earth, receive his soul in Heaven, by Christ our Lord. Amen. Almighty God wanted to call our brother to himself whose body we delivered to the earth to return to the place from which it was taken... Receive your soul and take it to the presence of the Lord. Oh son then? So go. Don't look like that, boy. Go... You will see that everything will be fine. Look that still tonight you'll sleep in your bed, in your little room. And look what your aunt will take very good account of you. My mother hasn't arrived yet... Have you been able to talk to Angela yet? Do not. He's got that idea she comes from. The last time she came here, look, it was at the festivities of Our Lady of the Agony, four years ago. She appeared there with a man, it's not even known if he was a boyfriend, if he was a husband. But since she fell out with her father, she never set foot here again. Can I? Do you have a little bit of chamomile tea there with some cookies to eat something. You've been rolling up all dinner. Come on. You have to eat. You have to help the aunt. Come on. Adelaide spoke to your teacher and you don't have to go to school tomorrow. Eat a little more, Alexandre. Alexandre, eat a little more... I am not hungry. You shouldn't walk around barefoot. The slippers broke when I fell. Excuse. Turn, turn, turn, turn. Get up here. - Do you want the blanket? - No. It's here folded at the bottom of the bed, in case you get cold at night. See you tomorrow. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I'm from social security, and I come to talk about Alexandre. Allow me to offer you my condolences. I have some documents here, Dona Josefina, and I would like you to read them very carefully. Our great concern, Dona Josefina, it really is Alexandre's well-being. If he doesn't have anyone to take care of him, he will have to go to a reception center. But I would like you to reconsider this possibility. I can't imagine myself to come back here. But it doesn't have to be here. - It might be... - Yes Yes. I understand, but... I don't know if Father Manuel explained it to you, Yes. Okay, I have the congregation... - Yeah, he told me. - and it would be very complicated, because I'm a few months away from taking perpetual vows and suddenly this is a... - I understand. - it's a twist a little too big. But of course I understand that he doesn't... - It's just that Alexandre can't stay alone. - He can't stay. He can not. Unfortunately or luckily it's my daily life in the congregation. Because we also have an institution of girls who come by court order. And so I know these processes. But right now... I think I need to fit. Because Dona Josefina would assume parental power. - Perental. - Exactly. I thought you were in your room. Sometimes it's important to let off steam. If you want to talk... Today when I came home, I... I passed Alice. She was here, wasn't she? She was. Alice was here because she she's worried about you. I'm going to the orphanage, right? We'll talk about it later. Now, when you get home in this state the first thing all you have to do is go to the bath. Come on. Go there. how long have you don't you shower, Alexandre? I do not know. - huh? - I do not know. Don't you know? So why don't you shower? - Because of the hand. - Because of the hand? And you are going to walk pig while you have your hand like that. It doesn't matter. Yes, ma'am. Then? Put a plastic bag in your hand, that's no problem. Oh! Get out there! But aunt, I'm cold. You're cold, nothing. You have to stay a little longer like this. Which is to make sure it all dies. She lifts her head up, because it still gets in your eyes, come on. Ready. let yourself be like this a little more. It doesn't hurt anyone. You're going out on this one. Treat Adelaide well that she has been a great friend of yours. I come tonight. See you later. We don't live alone in the world. sometimes before we think in our person we have to think about others. It cost you something to go to Adelaide's house, have warned her? Do not. No? Do you have something to tell me? Sorry, aunt. Let's go to sleep? See you tomorrow. Alexander. Then? What's up? I can't sleep, auntie. What time is it? It's half past three. Go to your bed, go. It's just that I had a nightmare about the grandfather. Go have a glass of water. And then you go back to bed. But... I wet the bed, auntie. So go... Let's go to sleep. See you tomorrow. Aunt. When are we going to Porto? When you behave yourself. I really wanted to go back there. I only went there once with the grandfather. We went to see the dragon game. The mother was with us too only she didn't get to enter. Did she do like her aunt? She went to live in Porto... You are boring today. But I'm sure she doesn't like me anymore. Of course she likes it. And will the aunt abandon me too? Will she also return to Porto? But who was here to take care of everything? Was it you? Yes. I can take care of the house, then! It would also be cool to live alone. Is there? Don't you need me? Do not. No? So you want to come here and wash your clothes? Oh aunt... does the aunt know my father? Do not. Grandfather and mother never said anything to you? I was never told anything either. Was he from here? If I told you I don't know who it is, how do you want me to know whether he was from here or not? Where are you looking at? - Shut up! - You're looking at Sandra's tits. I'll soon show you some scenes on the net. Look, do you want to go to my house and play console soon? Ya, it could be... But then lend me your cell phone for me to talk to my aunt? Bruno, Alexandre! Shall we stop whispering? My God, why are you so good? If you trusted me with my nephew... if this is what you want from me... give me a signal. Help me know what to do. Didn't you wash your hair? No, I'll have to wash it with that crap in eight days. It's okay. But in the meantime you can wash with normal shampoo. Look there, is that a bath? What is this here? - I don't know, it shouldn't have left. - Everything dirty. Bath! There... What is it? Nothing. There. Sorry, you're gonna have to tell me what that is. It hurts me here. It's a little red and it hurts. Show there. Come on. No, let it be. What you have everyone has. It's all in this world. You got it all on fire. try washing there and pull it back. I am unable. - Can not do it? - No... It hurts me. So we have to go to the doctor to see what you have there. You may need a circumcision or that it's just inflamed. I do not know. Turn around there. Ready. Now... Be careful it will come out hot. Give here. Comes here. Ready. I'll enjoy it and make dinner. And hurry up, okay? I thank you Lord. because being angry with me Your anger was appeased and you consoled me. God is my savior. I have confidence and I fear nothing. The Lord is my strength and my praise. You can come now. Good Morning. Beware that I'm going to open the window. Then? Did you get to sleep? Didn't you have pain? No. It doesn't hurt anymore. Orange juice... The aunt has to go to Porto tomorrow. If you want to come with me? - I can go? - You can. So I do. Aunt, can we go to Dragon Stadium? That's the hardest thing. I do not know. I don't know if we have time. Give here. I know you were very brave. When I opened my lip it was ten. Ten people grabbed me. Show. Well, I noticed that you have a scar here. This time it was only three. When you were born you had the infirmary all around you. Because? Because a child hasn't been born for a long time and you were like a kind of... Ah, yes it was. The grandfather even told me this story. Look, this is the Church of Santo Ildefonso. It's on the Battlefield. And this is the street I told you about. Look at the tram. Let's walk? - No, we don't have time. - Oh, okay. The city of Porto was not like that for some time. - Yeah, I guess. - With so many people. Aunt, aunt, aunt! Buy me these sneakers? - Come on. Go... - Aunt! Please! We've already taken such a long tour. - O aunt, look here! - I have to go now. Come on. 40% off, aunt! You don't need sneakers. You've stopped in stores three times. Yes, I need to go there! Please aunt. God bless you. See you soon. I miss you so much, sister. I need your help so much. I know. the death of your father it must have shaken you a lot. And now there is this child. But be strong and pray a lot so that God illuminates your life. I would be unable to leave my nephew. There are many ways to love God. Devotion to others, charity are other ways of us relate to God. You are my family. Josefina, we love you a lot. But you have to go on with your life spiritual wherever you are. You can always count on us. Thanks sister. Four. Five. See you tomorrow. Aunt. can you pet me just until I fall asleep? Give it a way, go. You only put it on again tomorrow morning. Then there are no more drops. You don't feel those little bites anymore, may I help? No, aunt. But now don't talk... You're so spoiled. Oh aunt, don't dry my hair too much. To be sexier. - To stay longer what? - Sexy. That's what Claudia said. Who is Claudia? A friend of mine. Sit there and I'll cut you a little bit of that hair. She puts her head back. Look at me. - Do you want me to cut your bangs? - No. Let it be. - My name is Nuno Mota. I am the notary of Vila de S. Sebastião. Yesterday your sister was here. Yes. She is the head of the couple and that's why we can proceed with the distribution of his deceased father's assets. I'm so sorry... Has Angela been to the village of S. Sebastiao? Angela Antunes, right? Angela Antunes, yes. - I wanted to know what day Ms. Josefina could come to my office. Just a question. Don't you have her contact information? - I can't make it easy for you, Ms. Josefina. - But we set a date and you clarifies everything with your sister. A hypothesis: if the mother comes back, what happens? Well... - If the mother comes back, it's obvious that the mother always has priority. But if... how am I supposed to explain this? And so... having a history of a mother who has already dropped out different times, how does this work? Only if something very serious happened - is that it could be prevented the union between a mother and a child. Is everything all right, Dona Josefina? Oh aunt. Aunt! Aunt, can you buy me this sweater? - So ugly. - Is nothing. Do you like it? I like. Come on, come here. What size is it. Yes, it's just one. It's an M. Can you try it? Yes. - How much is it? - Ten. - How much? - Ten. - Three? - Ten. Ten euros. - Ten?! - Yeah. - Do you like that? - I like! It's okay. So Josephine? Angela. Do you want to come in? I go first. How is Alexandre? It's okay. where is he? he walks with football games there at the championship and... today comes a little later. Are there oranges? No. This year I haven't picked oranges yet. I miss the oranges in our backyard. Everything is so neat. I'm sorry he's not here. I went through moments very complicated. I was hospitalized and... meanwhile i got married with a wonderful man which has helped me a lot. And I think I'm ready to restart and I would love to have my son by my side. I will leave my card here. Tell Alexandre to call me. Why didn't you wake me up, aunt? Good Morning. Sorry, I fell asleep. So what about Professor Filipe didn't call? He called, but I don't know why the phone was silent and did not hear. Aunt, we have a day full of important games. I really have to go. No, it's not important. you never stay here having lunch with me so you'll stay today. Auntie, but I really have to go. How are you going? Say it... - I'll go by taxi. - Are you taking a taxi?
