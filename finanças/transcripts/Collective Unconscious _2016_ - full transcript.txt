The core principal of hypnosis is that all hypnosis is self-hypnosis. And we can see this most clearly by examining the common and everyday trances that occur in our lives. For instance, when we look at our phones or when we look at computers. Screens of most any sort, in the way that they flash their colors and lights, will usually create at least some kind of low-grade trance that is completely natural. For instance, right now if you're watching this on a screen, which I imagine you are, there may be a little bit of it occurring. And that's absolutely fine. You can let this happen. In a movie theater, a very powerful trance state is simulated, in that all other stimuli is blocked out, and our senses are assaulted with light and sound. The subdominant hemisphere of the brain cannot tell the difference between real or imagined. The same thing occurs during dreams. Going into trance is easy. It's naturally occurring. All you need to do is let your gaze rest softly somewhere on the screen. Pick a spot. And just take a deep, cleansing breath. And just continue to watch. Notice the colors. Notice the light, notice the shadows. And let another deep breath easily and naturally occur, just rising in the body, and feeling the exhalation. And take one more now. Inhaling again. And maybe exhaling twice as long, letting all of the air out of the lungs, and just imagining what it might feel like if a wave of relaxation were to move over your body now, noticing how it feels, just how relaxed the big toe in your left foot is. Or just how relaxed the pinky finger in your right hand is. Noticing the feeling of the clothing and the skin. The sound and tone of my voice. Listening to my voice as if you were listening to music play. Notice that if you listen to it with that quality, you still understand every word. The subconscious mind understands every word. So feel free to listen to this whole experience as if you were listening to music play. All hypnosis being self-hypnosis, it's something that we allow to occur. Take a deep cleansing breath. And go ahead and take another. I'd like you to imagine that you're sitting in the audience of a movie theater. Nobody else there, just you looking up at the screen.

I'd like you to visualize on this movie screen now a possible future where you're going for a walk in your neighborhood, and you can tell just by looking at yourself, the non-verbal body language, as you walk through your neighborhood on a day some time, maybe this fall. And whenever you're ready, allow your awareness to move into the screen and experience that first-person. How does that feel? When I first came home, I thought I was in the future. You know why? Every, the whole style was different now. When I was home, this, they, they, people wasn't dressing like this, like all this, all that. Everybody was like, it was, it wasn't as fitted, it was like a little bit loose. Yo, everybody looking like a rap star, everybody. You don't see not one person without a roly. Or a shiny chain. You know what I'm saying, everybody is just fly now. I'm like, yo. And the technology. I first, the first time I used a phone, I was using it upside-down. I didn't even know. That happened to me a couple times. I was using it upside-down. I'm like, how do you use this? My man gave me an iPhone. He, how do you use this? I don't know how to use this. I started pressin' buttons and stuff, I'm like, when you come home, it's a whole different level, man. It's like you just, like, your mom givin' birth again. Oh boy, I ain't gon' lie, bro. I'm like, three weeks, finally gonna get some cheeks, bro. I had the same night. Like what the fu? You know what's crazy, I came home, didn't get no yeeks for like three weeks bro, right? Listen to this bullshit. Then I finally got some, some yeeks. I pop some bottle, right? I pop some bottle and get stupid drunk. I tried, and it wasn't working, bro. I was drunk, I was too drunk! It happens sometimes. I know one thing that I'm about to start doin' a lot. I'm about to start asking females for they IDs. These, these females is lookin', lookin' crazy right now. They lookin' wild, older, like they lookin' like they my age. It's, it's crazy now. I don't know what's in the water. I don't know what's in that water. You feel what I'm sayin'? There's somethin' in that water. Some hormone growths and all that, you know, 'cause, I'm not trying to go back to jail. They denied my, they denied my first address from jail. Before I came home they denied my address. I came home, they sent me to a three-quarter house. I was sick. Whoa, lemme tell ya. Just like a house for the dopeheads and crackheads and people that got nowhere, that they don't got shit. I mean, I, I got shit. A bunch of dope-heads, crack-heads, dirty. My heart was beatin', you know, and I'm just lookin' around, and it's all new because everything that I've seen I seen out the window. Whoa, man, my first night in prison was like the last day on earth. When you were standing in front of the judge, did you have a funny feeling in your stomach? When I stepped in front of that judge up there, I had a beautiful job. I had a beautiful kids' mother, my children, had a nice house, and she told me to come to the glass and I came to the glass and I said, listen, um, can I get a decent bail because I have a good job? She told me to forget about my job, forget about my house, forget about my family, forget about everything, and just worry about this time that she's gonna give me. What about the person who was standing in the courtroom with you? Do you think that they had a funny feeling in their stomach? No. I think in that particular case, Mr. Money, I think they would. They care about you, that's why they're here. Oh, I'm talking about your family. I'm not talking about the judge, I'm talking about your family. Anybody who was in the courtroom with you who cared about you, do you think that they had a funny feeling, and, when they were waiting for the judge to give you your type of sentence, that they were kind of holding, like please don't give him too much? Do you think that they felt uncomfortable? What about you Richard? I was uncomfortable myself. A lot of dudes come home and get violated before the year's, before, they don't really get a year in, they come right back. So that's probably one thing a lot of people think about. Not tryin' to get violated. 36 months. I had a job in Poughkeepsie, it's like an hour and a half away, doin' metal fabrication. I was makin' $52 an hour, and my parole officer, like, she tried to, she didn't just say she didn't want me to have the job, so she tried to, you know, like, wave around it and say that amount of money, for me, in my pocket, would remind me of the criminal lifestyle that I lived before I went to prison, and I don't, because, when I got the job, my car, it was, you know, like a luxury exotic car, BMW or somethin', so she's seen me drivin' the car, and that was, Oh, you're tryin' to play catch-up. She seen me with nice clothes, nice sneakers, so she said I look like I'm committin' crimes again when I'm actually doin' it legit. But she doesn't want me to be reminded of what, the way I used to live, so I couldn't go to that, that job. And then she basically summed it up and said, you gotta stay in the five boroughs. You make more money than them? They don't like that. Weeks before, I counted down, 20 days, 10 days, and finally got to that one mornin', and it's like, I just sat by the door, just waitin'. Got off the bus at 42nd Street. I had, I think, maybe $60 that I saved up from working for pennies in there, so it's like a bunch of people, it's nice outside, it's sunny. I'm just, I'm stuck, for a while, like I really stood in the same spot for like 20 minutes. Just lookin' up at the buildings. I felt like a tourist again. It was just like, you know, your heart is racin', and it's like, wow, but it's not a scary feeling. It's like, just an excitin', like goin' on a roller-coaster or somethin' like. Wild deep breaths. I was takin' wild deep breaths, I was like, this feels so wonderful. It smells way different. Even though it smells more nasty, it smells, the smell is way more nasty than, but it's like, it's like a freedom, a freedom, you've got that freedom air. You could, you could you could just keep walkin'. You don't gotta... It's the way that you remember that you was free too, that's it. It's a, no, it's that, even if it's dirty, it's that once you smell it, it's gonna hit you back like, oh yeah there was the time I was... It's that you keep walkin' and you don't have to run into a gate. You know what made me feel hype, though? What made me happy when I came home? I came home in the summer, too. You come home, you hear music blastin' from people's cribs, cars goin' by, trunk open, Dominican dudes blastin' they music dumb loud. That's how you know you in the town. Like, yeah I'm back in the city, New York! That'd be a good name for the thing. When you come home, that feelin'. Yo, really? Yo, so you're tryin' to tell me you first come home, right? You got a little feelin' you got. Yeah, but you don't believe, even, I'm talkin' about even if you notice it at that moment, I'm talking about you notice it like months later, and you really think like that moment in time, how'd that moment feel like, you probably never gonna feel like that again, right? If you have good, you have evil. If you don't have one you don't have the other. - Opposites. - Opposites. Yeah. But I think there's so much in-between. Good morning, St. Helens High. Today marks the 35th anniversary of our great volcanic eruption. Please rise for the pledge of allegiance. Are the St. Helens cheerleaders. We Are the. Mr. Beemus had a 10-foot penis.
