Then, we made a decision. fifteen 00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,544 We would live here forever, in the lower world, with you. We would divest ourselves of our divine power and we would live with the difficulties and the inconveniences that entails. [soft music continues] Some of us came looking for pleasure. twenty 00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,770 Others came looking for heroes. twenty-one 00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,190 [soft music intensifies] And some ... 2. 3 00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,576 Some of us came in search of salvation. [soft music stops] - [birdsong] - [happy music] - Yes. Huh? - [stretches and screams] I will arrive late to work! Why did not you wake me up, Bell? I woke you up several times. Hey? Bell. Yes? You have a good day. [laughs] 3. 4 00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,487 [laughs] Sure! I'll be back, goddess! Oh! Better I hurry too. [soft music] [pants] [inhabitant 1] Hello, adventurer!

Hey, be careful! - [blow and burst of glass] - [waitress, screaming] The dishes! - [mesera grumbles] - [Bell] Ryuu is not here? No, it is not here at this time. Do not you know anything about her, Bell? [Bell] I do not know anything. I see. [Bell] If I see her, I'll let her know. Thank you. [Bell] It's nothing! Good. [soft music continues] [Bell] Good morning! Oh, Bell! What are you doing, Eina? I prepare for the festival tonight. Are you heading to the dungeon? - [Bell] Yes! - Beware. An adventurer ... - [Bell] ... it should not be so risky. - Huh? I already know it! [sighs] [heroic music] - [Bell] Lili! Welf! - [Welf] It's here! Bell! [Bell] I'm sorry I made you wait. Good... We are going? To the dungeon. [Heroic music intensifies] [heroic music ceases] [crunch of gears] [grunts] [Bell exhales] - [shouts] - [monster growls] Welf! Leave it to me! - [Welf laughs] - [Lili] Crouch! [Welf, shouting] Ah! You are very careless, Welf. [Welf laughs] I'm sorry. [Lili] Now we're here, Bell. [Bell] Mmm? Are you going to the festival tonight? [Bell] Yes, I had planned it. So, can I go with you? - [Bell] Sure. - [laughs] Do you want to come, Welf? In that case, how about we do a little more money before? Yes. - In agreement. - [Welf laughs] [monsters scream] [insect screech] [bustle] [happy music] Wow! This is incredible! Is it the first time you come to the Divine Lunar Festival? - "Divine Lunar Festival"? - Yes It's a party that's been held since before that the gods came down. [Welf] The moon is used to symbolize the gods and ask for protection against monsters, right? This is also a habit of the lower world. It is appropriate for a city of adventurers like Orario. - [goddess] Bell! Let's try the squid! - [Bell] Moment, goddess! - Please, do not push me like that! - [Lili growls] [goddess] Mmm. - [Lili] Hestia? - [Hestia] Huh? It is a festival. Should not you be selling jagamarukun ? It is an opportunity to make money. It seems that a thief cat wants to seduce my Bell. So I asked them that they gave me the day off. [grunts] Who do you call "thief cat"? You behave as if you were not a goddess and you're going back and forth with Bell! - What? - [Lili] What? [growl] Hey, do not fight here. Welf, help me! - Good! Let's eat takoyaki! - [continue grumbling] [Bell] Welf ... - [man] Come all! - [all] Eh? [man] Those who are far away, listen! Those who are close, observe! That voice... [man] And the brave adventurers, make yourselves heard! What hero can draw this sword? What is Hermes doing? [Hermes] This is a legendary sword and only the chosen one can take it out. Whoever achieves it will receive the blessing of a chaste goddess! In addition, he will be invited to a trip around the world! The city council has already approved it! [joyful shouts] A legendary sword? [Lili] Hermes organized a fake event once again. But it seems fun. Let's try, Bell. Eh yes. - Let's try it too, Ais! - [Hestia] Oh! Well, of course. Oh? [both shout] Wallen-whatever! Hestia and Bell Cranel! Ais, we can not lose this competition! [Ais] Huh? In agreement. Bell, this is a battle for the honor of our family! - [both sigh] - [Bell] Hey, I do not think it's about that. - [heroic music] - [growls] [public, shouting] Come on! [competitor] Hell! It does not come out! [Hermes] Who will be the next participant? Here! I! [sad] There's no case. It does not move. Please, Lefiya! How fast you gave up! Who's next? - [audience exclaims surprised] - But look who we have here! She is the very Princess of the Sword! - Ais Wallenstein! - [Hestia growls] - [screams from the audience] - [Ais struggles] [viewer] Get her out, Princess of the Sword! [struggles] Ais Wallenstein begins to pull the sword! You can, Ais! - Huh? - [heroic music stops] No, he does not want to leave. But ... Ais is level six. Well, Bell, show him to Wallen-what-who's the best! [Lili] Good luck, Bell. Have fun. A level two like you could never get it out. What? [growls] Well, who will be the next participant? Hey? Will it be you, Bell? Yes, thanks for the opportunity. [Hermes] The Little Rookie faces the challenge! [woman's voice] I found you. Hey? [Bell groans] Oh [thinks] I see. Fate has chosen you. [Hestia] Bravo, Bell! [laughs] [joyful shouts] Awesome, Bell. He managed to get it out. [laughs] Did you see that? Can not be! So is! My Bell is awesome! Wallen-whatever-is not coming not the heels! [Hermes] Congratulations, Bell. [Bell] Eh, yes, but the truth I do not understand anything. [Hermes] Mmm. Let's introduce the sponsor of the trip. The sponsor? [soft music] Sagebrush! It's Artemis! Do you know her? She is a friend of mine from heaven. Is my best friend! Sagebrush! [soft music intensifies] - [soft music stops] - [Hestia] Huh? [Artemis] I found you! My Orion! - Ori ...? - ...? [laughs] [Hestia, hesitating] Mmm? Hey? What what what...? [hysterical] What is happening? - What does that mean, Artemis? - [soft music] Sorry. Was so happy. What do you mean "happy"? Goddess, we have not seen each other never before, right? Hey? Hey? What? - Hermes! - Mmm? Is that Artemis? No way! Maybe Artemis also got used to it to life in the lower world. That's impossible! And what kind of goddess was ... ...Sagebrush? Artemis is one of the virgin goddesses. A goddess of chastity, that values ​​purity. Basically, it's the moral authority against impure relationships. A fervent enemy of romance. [all] "Enemy of romance"? 2. 3. 4 00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,527 So, Why is he acting like this? [sobs] But why a goddess enemy of romance is the sponsor? A monster appeared in the outskirts of Orario. On the outskirts of Orario? Yes. The Artemis family found him, but it is difficult to control. He came to Orario in search of ... So, on the trip, he only has the name. Actually, is it a mission of Artemis to catch a monster? [Hermes] How smart they are! [Welf] It was very good offer to be true. - This is a fraud, Hermes. - Calm. [Welf] Huh? - [Hermes] Mmm? - [Bell] Ah. - I looked for you for so long, Orion. - [soft music] Hey, my name is Bell Cranel. [Artemis] No, you're Orion. My hope. Because I? There are many stronger than me, like Ais. Strength is not what makes you worthy of this sword, but a pure soul that does not know corruption ... Hermes, this sword ...? - I told you it's a legendary sword! - [Welf growls] It is a weapon endorsed by Hephaestus! And she has chosen you, Bell! "Chosen one"... The sword chose me. [soft music continues] [Bell] Eh? Hey? I want you and your immaculate soul come with me, Orion. [Bell] I ... - [Hestia] Enough! - Huh? [knock] [both sob] That hurt me, Hestia. Me too! - You're good? - Oh. Oh, thanks. - Moment! - Ah! Artemis, we accept that mission! Hey? Goddess? How could I not help a friend who needs me? - [Artemisa] Ah! - [Hestia] Huh? Thanks, Hestia. Many thanks. Hey? [hesitating] Also, It would be dangerous to leave you alone with Bell. So, I'm going too. Of course we will ask for a bigger reward. Well, since we are here ... [soft music continues] So, Bell, what do you say? Although I'm sure that you have already made a decision. I get it. We accept the mission. [exhale] [Artemisa] Thank you, dear children. They are not my followers, but, during this trip, we will be allies. Please, give me your word. - [Bell] Eh ... - Bell, kiss her hand. [hesitating] Oh, forgive me. [Hestia exhales angry] [Lili] Mmm. [think] Oh! It's ... [Bell] Lili? Lili? [thinks] It's an indirect kiss with Bell. - Hurry up, Little Lili. - Huh? [soft music continues] [sobs] Hey? Why are you crying? - [hysterical] Fool! This is for Bell! - What are you doing? Oh, oh! Well, since everything is agreed, Do we start the march? [all that? [adventure music] [Hermes] Do you like these tailored suits? Your design was supervised by me, Hermes, the travel specialist. The materials were chosen by hand. They are light and flexible. They have embedded fragments of rare metals, so they are 30% more durable That the others. Maybe it's just costumes, but they are strong as an armor. And its malleability allows move without problems. Only someone like me, Hermes, I could get costumes like that in just a few hours. - [Hestia] You look good, Bell. - [Bell] Thank you very much. - [Hermes thinks] Nobody listens to me ... - [Bell] You too, goddess. [Hestia laughs] Really? [exhale weary] Welf, did you bring the magic dagger? Mmm? Yes, just in case. [Bell] But if we have to leave Orario, Why are we on the walls? [Hestia] I do not know. - Artemis? - Huh? Know something? [Artemisa] No, nothing. Hermes, what do we do? Here they come. - [flutter] - Mmm? Hey? [laughs loudly] - Ah! - [Bell] Be careful, goddess! [Hestia, hesitating] Ganesha? So is! It's me, Ganesha! So we'll fly in these? Yes, I have already asked Ganesha. By land, it would take us a month. But, with these, we will arrive in ten days. Also, I have to go back quickly or Asfi will be angry. [Lili] What? What do you mean with...? - [dragon snorts] - Oh! [laughs] Do not worry. The domestic with a spell as soon as they left the egg. - [Lili laughs] - They are very submissive. Hey, are not we missing some dragons? 3. 4. 5 00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,808 To be honest, I did not get enough! So we'll go two by a dragon. Two ... Bell! Let's travel... [grunting] ... together ... [Hermes] Well, good. [Hestia, hysterical] Why? [Ganesha] Go carefully! [soft music] - You're good? - Huh? You are not afraid? Fear? It's dark, we fly very high and maybe the dragons scare you. To be honest, my heart beats a little fast. Hey? Your heartbeats go fast. Is that "throbbing"? [Hestia] Hey, Artemis! - Bell is my follower! - Huh? - Take it easy! You will fall, Hestia! - [Hestia growls] [Hermes] Hey! [Welf] What are you doing? - Take it easy! - [Hestia continues grumbling] - [Lili] Hermes! - Huh? Where are we going? Hey? [soft music continues] We are going to the ends of the continent, far from Orario. To the ruins of Elsos, which are in a vast and unexplored forest. [heroic music] [heroic music continues] [heroic music ceases] Oh, what a beautiful breeze. I could fly like this forever. Why are you so carefree? After a week of flight, I'm pissed. - Right, Bell? - [laughs] [Wind blows] [Welf] See? More forest. Hey? - Low! - Huh? - Quick! - Good! [tension music] What is that? [love] Oh! - [crush] - [monster squeak] Amazing. - Not yet. Go ahead! - Good! [tension music continues] Fire Ray! - [rumble] - [babbles] Huh? - [Hermes] What? - [Hestia] What was that? - [Lili] There's a problem! - [both] Huh? [Lili] Bell disappeared! Bell! Fire Ray! [tension music continues] [Bell] There are too many! [breathes agitated] Oh! Thunderbolt... They are too close. Oh! Sagebrush! [tension music intensifies] [chirps] Oh! [chirps] [exhale] Ah! [Artemis growls] [chirps] [breathes agitated] Hey? Oh! [moans] Sagebrush! [chirps] [tension music continues] Hey? [Lili] There they are! [Welf] What are those monsters? - Let's go to Bell, fast! - Yes Bell ... Artemis ... - [chirps] - [breathes agitated] [Bell pants] Do it! - [Lili] Oh! - [Hestia] What? [tension music stops] [fall rubble] Can not be... [Welf] Wow. Is that the power of the sword? [Bell] Artemis! - You're good? - [Artemisa] Yes. Hey? [exhale] Do not do anything risky, Artemis. "Risky"? Why? Hey? Well, you're still a girl. My grandfather said there is that defend the girls. - So... - [Artemis laughs] - Huh? - [laughs] Nobody had told me anything like that until now. Maybe I do not see it, but I'm much stronger than Hermes or Hestia. Anyway... [Hestia] Artemis! Bell! They are fine? [Artemisa] Yes. I know you are strong, but do not do anything risky. Your follower just told me the same thing. [laughs nervously] [girl] Wow! Amazing! [Lili] They are very fast. Go [woman] Thank you very much. How can I reward them? Oh, it's not necessary. Do you know those monsters? [woman] No, they have attacked other villages and everything has been very sudden. I've never seen monsters like that before. Maybe because we're out of Orario? [woman] I'm sorry. I do not know. [Hermes] Bell. The sword is dangerous, so try not to use it much. Ah good. - Hermes, this sword ... - Besides, we do not want to be discovered. Oh [Bell] Excuse me? [birdsong] Goodbye, god and goddesses! Thank you! - [croak of crows] - Helping people is very nice and everything ... - Huh? - ... but did you have to give them all the food? [Welf] We only have bread left. I do not need to eat. Maybe you do not, but the rest of us are very hungry! [Artemis] Eh? [all] Yes [Artemis] I'm so sorry! What's wrong with this fool? - Hey, she's still a goddess. - [mumbles] Goddess or not, a fool is a fool! A foolish goddess of fools! [sighs] - How did she end up like that? - [Lili grumbles] Is it so different? [Hestia] I had a tremendous determination, as an Amazon. In heaven, just if they saw her taking a bath ... Do not you have shame, pigs? [all] Thank you very much! Yes, that happened. Of course. Well, the sun is setting. We will stay here and we will go out again in the morning. Hey? And the food? [Hermes] We'll have to put up with it. [crying] But I'm so hungry! [Artemis, sobbing] I'm so sorry. Oh! Could serve. [all] Eh? [all] Oh! I'm going to try it. - Delicious! - Good choice. Masara, a fruit. When it is heated, the pulp melts and it makes a delicious juice. It's like the forest restaurant! [Welf] You do know, Bell. [Lili] Incredible, Bell. [Bell laughs] Orion, you do know a lot. Before living in Orario, my grandfather taught me these things. - Eh ... - Mmm? You do not eat? [Artemis] Eh, is that ... - I see. - [Hestia chews tasty] - [Artemisa] Ah ... - Huh? Say:"Ah." [Bell] Hey, this ... Oh no! Of course not! I say the same! [Lili and Hestia] Here you go! - [Bell yells] - [Hestia] Bell does not like it! Enough! [Lili] Enough you, Hestia! [both grunt] - [crickets singing] - [Welf] And what were those monsters? [Lili] I've seen scorpion-type monsters, but never like those. The woman said that they attacked other villages. [Hermes] It all started when it increased the number of monsters abruptly. Several families came to try to find the cause ... ... but they all disappeared. - [suspense music] - [Hermes] In the distant Elsos, the ruins had a lock. A bolt? For what? [Hermes] To prevent the erosion of the hills, pollution of the seas, deforestation and the death of things. A locked monster for the old fairies. - Antares. - [suspense music stops] Antares? But, over the years, He became stronger and stronger ... ... and finally broke the lock. Did you break the bolt? So... [Hermes] Yes, Orario took this very seriously and sent my family. There, I met Artemis, that he had traveled for the same reason. So, We return to Orario to seek reinforcements. Moment. Why did not they send to a stronger family? [Artemis] It does not matter. Only that sword can beat Antares. And that sword has chosen you. [cricket singing] [Hermes, laughing] Do not worry. While we have that sword, everything will be fine. Let's rest, Well, we'll be fine tomorrow. [crickets singing continues] [roncan] [Hestia] ... and Bell again did not wake me up. [Sagebrush] But did you get to work on time? [Hestia] Yes, for very little. But only for very little. Who knows what Hephaestus would have said if I was late? [Artemis laughs] It's always the same with Hephaestus, is not it? If I run out of work, I will be in trouble. I never thought you had a family. Well, Bell is the only member. Hestia? What? What do you feel for Orion? [laughs nervously] [hesitating] Well, he's a sweet follower. Well, it's something else. Like I can not live without him ... Eh ... - [Hestia] Mmm. - Huh? He is my treasure. I see. When I'm with him, my heart beats hard. What? What will this be? Bell is my follower! Already. [Hestia] Then, you can not feel that! Why not? "Why not?". Why not! I thought you hated those things, Artemis! Seriously? Where was the Artemis who hated romance? Oh Hey? Hestia? Artemis, where is your family? They are not here. But they await my return. Hey? You've changed. Oh yeah? Yes, the gods are supposed to be eternal, but you have changed. [cricket singing] [sighs] Life is full of complexities. [girl] What? Can not we go to Orario? [hits the table] And why not? [boy] It's an order from the town hall. They gave the strict order of not leaving Orario. [girl] But we have business in the ports! [boy] They're canceled. [girl, hysterical] What? What plot the city council? Damn! [Lefiya] Ais. Did you see anything in the sky? Do not - Let's go. - Oh ok. [river runs] [Wind blows] Oh! How is it possible? What is that? [sad music] [Bell] The forest is dead. [Artemis] This is the work of Antares. There are the ruins of Elsos. [suspense music] Antares is there? - [vibration] - Huh? - [Artemis moans] - Artemis! [trembling] It's coming. [suspense music intensifies] Hey? Is... Move! [moan] - Devils! - [Lili screams] [Hestia screams] - [suspense music stops] - [Bell groans] Are you okay, Artemis? - [Artemisa] Yes. - You guys... [Bell walks away] Goddess! Boys! We are fine! - [exhales relieved] - [Hestia, screaming] Are you okay? [Bell] Ah. Lili, are you hurt? Bell. [Lili] We're fine, but ... [Welf] What was that light? Sure, he was pointing at me ... No. I aimed for the sword you bring. [chirps] [suspense music] They are monsters ... [Hermes] This is not right. [Welf] Are they the same as before? [Hestia] No, they have a size and a different way. [woman] Come, errant wind, wandering traveler. - Cross the skies and run through the jungle. - [heroic music] [woman] It runs faster than everything else. Dye the light with stardust and destroy the enemy! Luminous wind! [explosions] Hey? [woman] Are they hurt? [Bell] R ...? Ryuu? Cranel. I did not expect to find you here. What are you doing here, Ryuu? They asked me to come for a difficult mission. They asked me. [Bell] Asfi. [Hestia] The Hermes family! - [furious] Hermes ... - [Hermes] Oh! [hesitating] Hello, Asfi. Moron! You left us watching the ruins and you left home alone! Calm down, Asfi! I went in search of whoever drew the sword. [Asfi] Even so, you should not have left! [Sagebrush] Asfi, please forgive Hermes. - Artemis. - [Hermes exhales relieved] Hey? Bell Cranel ... [exhale] You were the one who pulled the sword? To be honest, I expected a stronger family. [hesitating] I'm sorry. [Hestia grunts] How are things, Asfi? They worsen without ceasing. Forest erosion advances and the monsters keep playing. The villages in the area They are all destroyed. [Hermes] Have you attacked the ruins? [Asfi] A portal blocks our way and prevents attacks. [Hermes] I see. A portal? Yes. That portal separates us from Antares. [Bell] Can not open? [Ryuu] We can not. [tension music] Oh - [Hestia] Artemis. - Huh? We need to talk. [tension music continues] Hey? - [Hermes] Bell. - Huh? Hermes? They need to talk among goddesses. Leave them alone. [Bell, hesitating] Eh ... sure. That light. What is happening? Why that ...? I know you're Artemis. But you do not act like Artemis. - Who you are? - [tension music intensifies] [Asfi] For now, everything is still normal here, but soon everything will change. We use this place as a base to continue attacking the ruins. [girl] Are you tired from the trip? Further on, there is a source where they can take a bath. Really? Lucky! I'm all sweaty! - [Hermes] Bell. - Huh? Hermes? It is time for our expedition. - [adventure music] - Today they will become legends! Listen well! A little further, There is a paradise for young ladies! Lili, Asfi and the others they are bathing naked! - [swallows] - [Hermes] And Artemis ...! One of the three virgin goddesses! No one has seen her naked! Not even a god! Once, my dream was shattered. But my heart still guides me. He says:"Do not give up!" And now I have you! My allies for a common cause! We are facing a difficult challenge! But, when we overcome them, their names will be engraved in the history! Get up, young people! Become real heroes! [all] Yes! - Yes! - Can I go home? [Hermes] Heaven, protect us! Lead these heroes to victory! Follow me! [moan] - [all] Ay. - [Asfi] That I thought. I expected more from you, Welf. Men are so stupid. Perverts Moment. Cranel is not here. Bell! Keep going! Stand on our fallen and claim victory! "Victory"? - Where are Artemis and Hestia? - [girl] Huh? Hestia has already gone to bed. And Artemis ... Did anyone see her? [Lili] No. I can not do this. Become a voyeur. I feel as if this has already happened ... [soft music] Oh Hey? - [leaves crackling] - Who's there? [hesitates] I'm sorry! I got lost and ...! I did not want to spy! I'm going! - [Artemisa] Wait. - Huh? - [soft music] - [Artemis laughs] You got lucky. Before, I would have nailed you an arrow where you are [Bell] Eh? So those stories about you they are true Who knows? Perhaps. Hey, back then, the goddess ... Hestia was also different? [Artemis] I think so. The Hestia that I met I was lazy and lazy. Oh, I think that has not changed. [Artemis] He used to lock himself in his temple. [Bell] Did he lock himself? [Artemisa] Yes, when I visited her, He was so happy It was like a puppy who asked that they play with him. [Bell] I can imagine it. - [Hermes] Hestia. - Huh? What are you doing here alone? I'm taking a walk. [Hermes] Mmm. With a sword that you do not even know how to use? [Hestia] Ah. - [soft music] - [Hermes] Should not you look for Bell? Must be alone with Artemis. Stop pretending. You have helped them to be together. [Hermes laughs] More feel for each other, the sword becomes stronger. You already know, Hestia, right? [Hestia] Do you have to ...? Does this sword have to be? [Hermes] Yes. [screams] There has to be another way. If we work together, sure ... - Hestia! - Ah! [soft music continues] [Hermes] We are staying without time and without options. [Hestia] But see Artemis ... [sobbing] It is different. It's different, but ... Is it so... [cries] Artemis does not deserve it. So, you wanted to throw the sword into the river? - [Hestia cries] - [laughs moved] How good you are, Hestia. [soft music continues] [Sagebrush] She used to laugh and cry with me. I saw Hestia share her joy, I saw his compassion and I admired her. I adore the goddess. - I'm sorry I got you into this. - Huh? You are going to face terrible obstacles. [hesitating] It's okay! It does not matter what monsters appear, I'm going to defeat them! I swear I will protect you! Oh - [Artemis] You're like a true hero. - Huh? [hesitating] No, of course not. Yes I liked reading stories of child heroes ... [soft music continues] I dream of being a hero. They defeat any monster and overcome any obstacle. They bring joy to so many people. There are never any heroines with tragic stories. They save everyone. I want to be a hero like that. - [Artemis] I think I understand. - Huh? I see why Hestia is so happy when he is with you [Bell] Eh? [Artemis] She must be in love with you. What? Impossible! She? Never! [Artemis laughs] You said it yourself: "A goddess is still a girl." Your... ... you idealize the gods a lot. Oh ... [Sagebrush] I am a goddess of chastity. I never approved of romance. I hated even interacting with others. But one day my followers they told me something They told me:"Love is wonderful." I think I understand it better now. Dance with Me. [soft Japanese music] [soft Japanese music continues] [Artemis] Did you know? The gods that descend to the lower world enjoy 10 000 years of love. [Bell] Ten thousand years of love? [Artemis] With you, those who are reborn. An eternal love with our children. Orion, how happy I am of having met you. [soft Japanese music ceases] [Steps] [Artemis] As everyone knows, the territory around the ruins has become a nest of monsters. The strength of Antares continues to grow. Surely, We will face great obstacles. But do not doubt! Do not fear! There is no place for defeat! This will be our strategy. The Hermes family will scare the enemy away. Just scare it away. Do not do anything risky. [all] Understood! - [Artemis] Falgar. - Goddess. You will be in charge. - [Falgar] Understood. - Mmm. - [dramatic music] - While they keep the enemy away, we will enter and we will attack Antares. "We"? Only my divinity can open the portal. - I must go too. - Artemis! - [Hestia] I'll go too. - Huh? I can not let you go alone. - Then, I'll go too. - [both] Huh? Wait, Hermes! Not again! - Mmm. - [laughs] You knew this would happen. I hate this. [laughs] Let's go. We expect a special payment. We are very demanding with money. We also! Little Lili, do you know ...? [Lili] We have that right! - [Ryuu] It's true! - [laughs] - [Artemisa] Thank you, my children. - [dramatic music continues] It will be a difficult battle. There will be many fallen. But I hope Do not give up on your fight ... ... for this, our beloved lower world! [all, euphoric] Yes! [let man! - [creaks] - [man that? [moans] - [tension music] - [screams] It's not possible. Do the monsters attack us by surprise? Who cares? It goes according to the plan. It is true. They just went ahead a bit. Make way! - [screams] - [growls] [screams continue] Asfi, go! This is no place for you! [moans] [Tension music intensifies and ceases] Take care of them, Asfi. [dramatic music] [Hestia] I did not know there were ruins like that. [Welf] How huge. [Asfi] An ancient and forgotten temple. What a silence. Do not forget the surprise attack. Do not let your guard down. Let's go. [steps approaching] Where does that light come from? It's the light of the bolt. The fairies who placed it are like me. Basically, They were my oldest followers. [Bell] For so long? [Ryuu] We arrived. This is the portal I was talking about. - [suspense music] - Here we go. Behind this, is Antares. [gear crunch] - Oh. - [suspense music intensifies] [Lili] They're ... [Ryuu] They are infecting the temple. Is... I did not know it was so serious. - [creaks] - Huh? - The exit! - [all] Eh? - [creaks] - Huh? [chirps] [suspense music continues] Those are...? Are those eggs? Make your way! [growls] [Bell screams] - [breathes agitated] - [creaks] - Ah! - [knock] Goddess! [chirps] [Hestia] Ah! [Bell breathes agitated] [Asfi] Go back! Oh! [suspense music continues] [chirps] - What ...? - Did they survive the attack? Impossible. Did the explosive oil have no effect? [Hermes] Self-reproduction, evolution ... Even that happens at an extraordinary speed here? [suspense music continues] [chirps] [shouts] - [Ryuu] Come, wind wandering. - Huh? Wandering traveler Cross the skies and run through the jungle. It runs faster than everything else. Dye the light with stardust and destroy the enemy! Luminous wind! - [suspense music intensifies] - [explosions] It worked? [Ryuu] No, they're still alive. At this rate, they will be more dangerous than the dungeon. [screams of monsters] [Eina] Huh? Why did it break out of nowhere? Something happens? You seem annoying. This. [girl 1] Wow, you broke it. Damn. It was my favorite. - [girl 1] Hey. - Mmm? I have not seen your little friend for a long time. Where is? Oh, it's out of Orario, on a mission with the Hermes family. Seriously? How weird. Had not they banned that the adventurers leave Orario? Yes. [thinks] I hope it's okay. [man 1] Hey, that ...? - That is normal? - [girl 2] How strange. What's going on? - [woman] Until yesterday ... - [man 2] It's really very weird. [woman] I mean, in that direction ... What is that? What's going on? [man 3] Help! [horse whinny] - [man 3 pants] - What's going on? You look very agitated. [man 3, panting] Re ... forces ... - Huh? - [man 3 yells] Reinforcements! Call the adventurers! I mean the first class! [scared] Calm down! What happened? This exceeds us! The monsters ... - [suspense music] - [screams] [man 3] The monsters from the dungeon are crazy! It's amazing! We have to hurry up before it gets out of hand! Oh! I get it. [Eina thinks] Bell ... [suspense music continues] [breathe agitated] [pants] Fire Ray! [pants] Bell, here is an elixir. - Thanks, Lili. - [monster screams] That... We are close. Sagebrush... I'm fine. Let's go. [dramatic music] [Hestia] No! Oh Let's go back. You've done enough. Let's go back. I'll do ... We'll do something about it. [sobs] A) Yes... Artemis, I want you to know that I ... [melancholic music] [whispering] Thank you, Hestia. [Hestia sighs] [melancholic music ceases] [pants] [viscous liquid runs] [tension music] Is that Antares? [shouts intensely] - [moans] - Artemis! Drag it. Please, Orion. There! [disgusted] Ah! - That is... - Do not... Why...? That is... Why...? Oh [tension music continues] [Bell] Why ...? Sagebrush... [Antares screams] [moan] [tension music intensifies] [metallic vibration] That is... What? [explosion] [Welf] Little Lili! You're good? [Lili] Welf! Where are the others? [Asfi] What happens? That is Arcanum, the divine power. How is it that a monster has it? It is that it consumed Artemis. [sobs] [both] Oh. Welf, where are Bell and Artemis? They are not here. - They must have fallen. - Oh. [Lili] Bell ... [dramatic music] [Bell] These are ... [Artemisa] My followers. I could not do more than observe ... ... while that which consumed me murdered my children. While I murdered them With my own hands. [whispering] I'm back. [Bell] So, who are you? [Artemis] I am what remains of Artemis. Hey? [Hermes] It's a ghost that lives on the sword. Basically, what's left of a goddess. She is Artemis and she is not Artemis. That means... [Hermes] Having consumed divine power, Antares defies reality. [growls] [Lili, hysterical] Then, There is no way to defeat him! We can not beat him. Can the gods do something? - [Hestia] I'm sorry. - Huh? Sorry. [populace] Wow! What is that? [inhabitant] What fear. - [dramatic music continues] - [bustle] What is that? What's going on? Two moons? - [Ais] No. - Huh? That is not a moon. [dramatic music intensifies] What is that? That is Arcanum. And that ... is Artemis's arch. The most powerful arrow in the sky, shot by the goddess of chastity. I already know that! To use such power in the lower world it's going against the rules! If that fool Artemis is using it, It should be sent to heaven back! It is that or something has imprisoned it. [roar] The dungeon shakes. - He must be afraid. - [tension music] If activated, it will fly the lower world through the air. [boy] The worst that could happen is that the monsters escape to the surface. Make yourselves heard! This is the village of the adventurers! Do not let the monsters invade us! There is only one thing left to do! Defend it with our lives! [shout] [tension music intensifies] [tension music stops] [girl] That cheat of Uranus! He kept us in Orario because I knew what was going to happen! Forget this. Even if all the gods of Orario they would unite, they could not stop it. Who cares? Even so, We have a responsibility to take on! [exhale] Ottar. - Goddess. - Go too. Are you sure? Yes. The only thing that remains is to trust them. [Hermes] There's only one way to kill him. [Asfi] With that sword? [Hermes] It's not a sword. It is an arrow. Before they caught her, or after, Artemis used the last of her power to summon that sword. A weapon made by a god. "A weapon made by a god"? Hephaestus told me once. It's a weapon from heaven, able to kill even a god. [Artemis] Her name is Orion. In the language of the gods, it means "the one that pierces". Hey? Now he is asleep, but Antares will come soon. - [Antares screams] - [dramatic music] [Artemis] Like a monster who possesses divine power, Antares is ... ... like a paradox in a cataclysm. This arrow that defies reality It is the only thing that can kill him. [Bell sighs] Is it an arrow? Are you too late, Hermes? [Asfi] Wait. Asfi. [Asfi] Do you want to leave the destiny of the world in the hands of Bell Cranel? We have no alternative. [Asfi, furious] It does not matter! Would you force a young boy to load with that? The sin of being a matadioses? - Do not. - [dramatic music continues] [Hermes] You're wrong This is not about that. [Bell] No ... [sobbing] No ... Do you want to...? Because you picked me? [hysterical] It was not that ... - Why me? Why me? - [dramatic music intensifies] - [exhale] - [dramatic music intensifies] [moan] Hey? [Antares screams] [adventure music] [screams] Damn! Orion! [Bell growls] [moans] Damn, damn! Damn! Orion ... Ah! - [knock] - [Bell groans] [adventure music continues] I said I would protect you. It does not matter what monsters appear, I'm going to defeat them! [thinks] I swear I'll protect you! I promised ... ... that would protect you! [knock] [shouts] Fire Ray! [Antares growls] Hey? [Antares screams] [Bell groans] - [rumbles] - [shouts] [adventure music stops] [with a broken voice] Artemis ... [Ryuu] Over there. [pants] [Artemis, trembling] Please, Orion. Before my arrow crosses you ... ... take your arrow and ... Sagebrush! [voice in echo] [soft music] Sagebrush... [Bell sobs] [cries disconsolate] [shouts] - Oh no! - I am going! Attend Bell Cranel! [tension music] I will try to buy time. It is understood. [Welf] Little Lili. Yes. - Taking. - Huh? The magic dagger? - [Welf] Do not waste your one chance. - [Lili] Good! [growls] [Antares screams] [tension music continues] [Ryuu screams] [Asfi screams] [outbursts] [moans] - Lion! - [Antares screams] [shouts] [tension music continues] - [Hestia moans] - Hestia! [shouts] [metallic rumble] What do we do? No exit! [exhale] They are like locusts! - Ah! - [growling] [girl] A winkler? [tension music intensifies] Go The best of the reinforcements. [Ottar] We can not afford that contaminate the presence of the goddess. We will fight together. Let's get them back! [all] Yes! [tension music continues] [screams] Ah! [Welf grunts] [Lili] Everyone ... Hey? Bell. Oh [Hestia pants] [moans] - Bell! - [exhale] Please get up! [sobbing] Do not let the wishes of Artemis have been in vain! The world that she loved ... The children she loved ... [dramatic music] [crying] Open your eyes! Listen out! She is still crying! [hysterical] Please save Artemis! [Bell] Get away, goddess. Bell. - [ringing of bells] - [Antares growls] Oh, no, it can not be true. Shoot, Little Lili! Taking! [metallic vibration] [dramatic music continues] [exhale] [Lili moans] [Welf moans] Why...? [metallic pops] [Welf moans] Welf! - [moans] - [ringing of bells continues] Oh - [Antares screams] - Ah! [heroic music] Bell ... Eh? [Bell] I dreamed of being a hero. To defeat any monster and bring joy to many people. Where there would be no heroines with tragic stories. [Antares growls] [Bell] To save everyone. That's the hero he wanted to be! [Heroic music intensifies] [Hestia] Artemis. Give us a little more strength. [Welf moans] That's... The light of Artemis. [rumbles] [heroic music continues] [growls] [Hermes] That's it. This story is not about to kill a goddess. In this story, you save a crying child. [metallic shock] [Antares screams] [shouts] [metallic shock] [metallic vibration] [metallic vibration] [rumbles] [rubble fall] [roar] [Antares exhales] [sad music] [Hestia] Artemis, I've always admired you. You were a kind, strong and dignified goddess. During our trip, you did not stop surprising me because of how much you had changed. But I had fun. I had so much fun. [sad music continues] [sobs] [shouts] [crying] Artemis! [glass clash] [silence] [Artemis] Thank you ... Orion. [silence continues] [soft music] Sagebrush? [Artemis] Did you know that even the gods reincarnate when they die? Oh? So smile. Maybe we'll see each other again. When will that happen? Who knows? In 100 years. Or maybe in 1000. It could even be 10,000 years from now. I will not be alive anymore, then. But maybe your reincarnated being alive in this lower world. I know we will see each other again. So... ...when we meet, let's share 10 000 years of love, Bell. [sobs] [soft music stops] [shouts] [roar] [melancholic music] [melancholic music continues] [joyful shouts] [soft music] We are in debt to you. I only fulfilled my mistress's wishes. [metallic voice] The dungeon is back under control. Thanks to the Loki family and the others, we only suffer minimal losses in the city. [black cape] The arrow of Arcanum what was in heaven has dissipated. Although it was something unexpected, They have defeated the ancestral monster. Uranus, what happened to the goddess Artemis? It is gone. [Uranus] A young boy saved her. [black cape] Bell Cranel ... [soft music continues] [Asfi] Hermes. [laughs] It's okay. We can wait. I could not save it. I promised that I would protect her ... Bell. I know that maybe you can not forgive yourself. But ... you saved her. You saved Artemis. How do you know? Look... Hey? [soft music intensifies] [birdsong] [Hestia] Artemis is talking. He's saying:"Thank you." [soft music continues] Was he crying? He was smiling, was not he? [sobs] Yes. You became the hero of Artemis. Goddess. I want to become stronger. [Hestia] Good. [happy music] [closing music]
