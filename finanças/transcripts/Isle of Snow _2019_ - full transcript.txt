[narrator] There is no rule that says a story must start at the beginning. This story starts right now. They can ski our mountain but they can never take our snowboards. [all screaming] We are all connected. Everything. I've based my whole life around it. [tribal music playing] [narrator] What made you start? Was it a feeling? Was it the fun? Was it the friends? Or was it the trends? Or maybe, it was the go against the trends. Was it the revolution? Or an escape from the pollution? Maybe it was freedom. Maybe it was flight. Or maybe it was getting away with it. By putting up a fight. Maybe it was all of it. Or maybe it was none of it. Join us as we explore the snowboard world through the passion and the perspectives of the people who live it, that have made it their lives, and followed their passions. [tribal music continues] Show the world the world that you want to see. Go where it's inviting. In this journey, what you focus on is what you see. Wake up, and live the great daydream. One or two, two out of three? Care to make it interesting? [narrator] What is the age limit to having fun? Look around you. Imagine 20 years from now, who will still be riding with you? I guess we'll just go in increments. [narrator] It's all about going for it, and everyone cheering for your success. Or not. That's it. Jumped in it, you know, jumped into the barrel. [narrator] It's colder in the mountains than by foot and everybody knows it. [exclaiming] [narrator] The land is sacred. These words are at the core of your being. This has always been about turning dreams into reality. And to those who said it wouldn't work out, what do dreams know of boundaries? Never on schedule, always on time. Let's remember what snowboarding is to us, and let's arrive together. No matter which path, trail, spoke or tail you took to get there, this story begins and ends with Isle of Snow. Hmm. Voiceover. Yeah, that hasn't been done. Snowboarding is the opportunity to get out into nature and to connect with the earth and your spirit, combine those two into one downhill momentum, achieving terminal velocity, and viscosity at the same time. Something that I truly love. That to me is snowboarding. ["Do Wrong Right" by The Devil Makes Three playing] [whooping] [whooping] [man] Oh my god! [music continues] [inaudible] [music continues] [inaudible] [exclaims] [Chris] Have fun, guys. See you at the bottom. [man on radio] In five seconds. Five seconds. [device beeps] [Chris] And billy-goating in. I will see you guys at the bottom. Have so much fun. Drop in in ten. [man on radio] Okay, ten seconds for Chris. Ten seconds. [Chris] Is my GoPro rolling? - Drop in. - [man on radio] Drop in. [Chris] How'd yours go? ["Anti Taxi" by La Femme playing] [man] Sick, that's really sick. [man] Oh my god! [inaudible] [music continues] [chuckles] [music continues] [man] Oh! Madness! Oh my god! ["01/01/00" by QEK Junior playing] [barking] Ow! [whooping and cheering] [music continues] [grunting and groaning] [music continues] [man] Here goes the one. [man] When I started skating with my best friend, Daniel, we didn't have a driving license and used to walk everywhere. We always said [speaking foreign language] which means, you know, on the mountain, it's colder than by foot. My name is Wolfgang Newell, I'm from Austria. And I'm snowboarding for 27 years. I've been shaping boards for the last 13 years. I guess it's hanging out in nature, which keeps me inspired, you know, like, it's such a rad thing. [peppy music playing] I mean, just to put the pieces together, and be in the right place at the right time, and score with your homies. To become a pro was not necessarily a goal. To be a pro snowboarder now, you know, it's like a dream. But then it was more, you know, about being fans, and that what fuels the passion to this day, I guess, you know and kept the fire burning. Shaping boards, surfing, skating. Outdoors, you know, it's such a vivid cosmos to be in, it's really hard not to... To get inspired about... About that whole culture. [man] Yeah! [Wolfgang] What is snowboarding to you? It's fun, it's anger management, it's meditation, challenging, it's peaceful. It sucks hanging out at lift lines, you know. It's questioning our nature. Sometimes it's being in tune with nature. Can be a lot of things. [dreamy music playing] Future of snowboarding, it's uncertain. That's the beauty of it. Shaping boards is similar to riding the boards. There is so much influence really, you know, so much rad influence. It triggers so many different ideas, it's even hard to materialize the body, you know, you just, you pick and choose, and, you know, point it. Whoohoo! This must be my 21st video part. What is pro snowboarding? For right now, it's a dream. Don't wake me up. ["Customer" by The Replacements playing] [chuckles] Steep and deep. ["Pusherman" by Curtis Mayfield playing] Pretty tight. I'm right here. [music continues] This is snowboarding. [exhales] [inaudible] [music continues] [cheering and whooping] [grunts] Yo! Give me some! [laughing] [music continues] Fuck off, dude! First fucking try, dude. Oh man! That was huge. [music continues] [whooping] [music continues] [cheering] [music continues] - Oh my god! Yes! - [man 1] Dude! - [man 2] That was fucking insane! - [man 1] Dude. [man 2] What was that? Bloody Dracula back 7. [man] Oh shit! Get the head! [groans] [inaudible] That's it. Duck in it, you know, duck into the barrel. Straight out. [laughing] Okay, do it for fun! [man] Just floated. [cheering] Pretty rad, huh? Yeah! Sketchest jump ever. Hole like this. And the tree thin like this... [laughs] Dude. That's so good, I think Transworld might buy it for their magazine. [cheering and whooping] ["Fight" by Warish playing] [woman] Oh my fucking god. [laughing] [man] Holy shit. Dude. What? That was sick. - That was tight. - Yo. [indistinct conversation] [man] What do you... What do you think? ["Free Bird" by Lynyrd Skynyrd playing] [bleep] It's not working... [bleep] leprechaun... [bleep] lickin' [bleep] munchin'... ...fart-huffin'... [bleep] Oh, it's not on. There we go. [man] Yeah, I feel Nicolas is one of the best snowboarders ever to live. I can see he's retained the playing aspect that we were all hooked on when we got started. And now he's combined it with a high level of mastery. For me, mastery is when you studied something so long, it's no longer in your mind. It's part of your makeup. Part of your body. You don't really think how to do things, they just happen in the moment it's needed. It's super-rare in this world that they are combined and beautiful to watch. I feel like it's where magic shows up in our world. And Nicolas definitely has a magic wand. [man] And what about the snow in Utah? You like that? There's too much powder here. [Root Down by Beastie Boys playing] [mumbling] [music continues] [woman] I'm loving this. [speaking foreign language] [whooping] [man] Yeah! ["We're Gonna Fight" by 7 Seconds playing] [speaking foreign language] [indistinct conversation] Ah! I think you're gonna need a little more speed. [man] Oh! [music continues] [whooping] [laughter] [indistinct conversation] - [speaking foreign language] - [laughter] [man] I'll give you some cash, you got my info. We'll clean it up, like... [man] I'm sorry, man, you gotta leave, right now. Can I... All right. When are you guys done? ["Flower" by Jehnny Beth playing] Day at the spa. [man] A lot of people on their phones. [man] Just act like you were pointing shit. - Nothing to point at. - Ah, here you go. [indistinct conversation] Time changes fast here in Salt Lake. Headache, dude, throbber. When you haven't tommied for a while, it's the fastest reminder of being human again. Want some? [speaking indistinctly] [whooping] [exclaims] I had an accident. I didn't mean to, but I had an accident. All right. This two for one grand opening sale. - We're gonna be throwing shit away. - Everything... Used toasters, used toilets, Top Ramen, we got everything and it's going quick. There are customers here. Right inside. [indistinct conversation] [indistinct conversation] [whooping] I'm sweating. That is sick. - [man 1] Yeah. - [man 2] Nice. Looks warm tomorrow. Maybe we should go climbing. [overlapping talk] [man] Dude, this is not out future. [man] Gonna write the theme song for today? [guitar strumming] Have a wonderful time up there. This is happening right now. No, for sure. It just seems like kind of a weird angle. [man singing] ♪ When I say "we" I mean ♪ ♪ A couple other guys named Judd and Frank ♪ ♪ They're going to send it off a thing that they call Frapstown ♪ ♪ And hopefully they don't go "splat" ♪ ♪ On Frapstown ♪ Frappi-frappi-lappa-lappa ding dong ♪ ♪ I know a guy and his name is Jim Fraps ♪ ♪ And he's got big fingers And they got giant gaps ♪ ♪ Between them ♪ Thank you so much, it was super awesome, like you showing us all the spots and stuff. No problem. I wish we had more time. [helicopter blades whirring] This thing's balls. It's 4000 meters high. - Slowly. - Just gotta think like Blair. Going fast. Yeah. Speed is your friend. Dude, if gravity was reversed, come through, pop off that lower one to the upper one, to the log jam. [indistinct conversations] - No way. That's steeper. - [man] That's steeper. So we could see Ozzy probably chilling at home. [man] Yeah. You could. [man] Oh, that was it? Shh Can you hear it? Me neither.
