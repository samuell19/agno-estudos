($ Scott Joplin: "The Entertainer") (Narrator) This is a film about a fat man on a beach. Did you hear what I said? This is a film about a fat man on a beach. Do you really want to sit there and watch if? Well, don't say I didn't warn you. ($ Ragtime piano music continues...) (Seagulls screech) A man taking pictures of a man taking pictures. There must be something in that. (Ragtime music fades) So... let's be comfortable, shall we? Now then, why are we here? Ah, the old questions! You remember the old questions? Why are we here? Why are we here? The old philosophical questions. I'll have to go and think about it. ($ Ragtime piano music resumes...) So, if we can't answer questions like: 'Why are we here?' Can we answer any other sorts of questions? One, like say: 'Where are we?' Where are we? Well, it's a long story actually, but I'm going to tell it to you all the same. Round the coast from here there was a tribe, an aboriginal tribe. This was several hundreds of thousands of years ago. Very little is known about them, of course, except their name, they were called the Hellawi, and they lived in a marshy district. And this marshy district had enormous bulrushes or sort of prehistoric reeds which grew six foot tall. This was a bit tough on the Hellawi because unfortunately, they were only five foot six tall. So they spent most of their time going around saying: "Where the hell are we? Where the hell are we? "Where the hell are we?" (Welsh man) "What do you know of Lleyn? You'll notice the weather changes a bit in this picture from time to time. Where the hell are we, though? We still haven't decided where we are. Can I start that again? Yes. You'll notice the weather changes quite a lot in this picture. Where the hell are we? Well, we're just about here. Right on the end there. I used to chew my nails, but I couldn't live off it and I only had 21 in any case. We're just on the end here. This is the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales, Caernarfonshire. It sticks out like an arm from North Wales. And there's Anglesey up here. Every school girl knows that. It looks like a head of a diver diving into the Bristol Channel, the Irish Sea. We're on a beach called Porth Ceiriad Bay, right on the end here. This enormous lock-jaw like location is called Hell's Mouth. It was called Hell's Mouth because any sailing ship that got becalmed across here was driven ashore by the currents and inevitably wrecked. The locals used to be very savage at the time and used to cut rings off people's fingers, and things like that if they foundered ashore. There's a mountain here called Garn Fadrun. You can stand on top of that mountain and see all around the peninsula. You can comprehend this... (Pop!) ...peninsula as a place... Now one of the lights has gone. So probably you can't see very much at all now. Why all these explanations? Anyone would think we were making a film for the mass audience. (Welsh man) "What can an Englishman know about Lleyn? How did I find this place in the first place? Well, I was hitchhiking through North Wales. At the time I was a rather elderly student at 26 and I'd been reading English, which is a very bad thing for a writer to read. A quite stupid thing for a writer to read actually at university. And I'd been besotted by Irish writers - like Sam Beckett and James Joyce and Flann O'Brien - and I wanted to see the Dublin that they'd all written about. So I hitchhiked from London on the Holyhead Road through North Wales, and I was given a lift, not to say picked up, by a man who owned a country club at Abersoch. And he, during a course of perhaps three quarters of an hour car journey along the Ab, offered me a job as a student, as a barman - because I was a student, I was obviously going to be cheap for him - at this country club he ran in Abersoch. I couldn't take the job then, I went on to Dublin. But after about a month my money ran out then, naturally, and so I rang him up and said, "Is the offer of the job still open?” And I came here. And that's the way, one of those things... if I'd been sitting in a different place on that road, or if I'd... in some way just missed it by ten seconds, that man stopping at that point... the whole of my life would have been different subsequently. I shouldn't for instance have written the first novel I wrote, which was about the experiences of that summer here in Lleyn. That was how I came to Lleyn. I remember leaving him on the junction of that road in, um... off the Ab. He took me as far as, er... I think it was just past Betws-y-Coed, and he said, "I'm going down there." And I looked down there, and it was a marvellously sunlit glacial valley. It looked like El Dorado. It looked absolutely marvellous. So when... This was probably one of the things which made me remember his offer of the job and made me want to go, because it looked like El Dorado. It looked like a very special place. And Lleyn is a very special and a very curious and a very strange place. ($ Welsh ballad, "The Young Man From Lleyn") (5 Ballad draws to a close) That's enough of that! You're not meant to be enjoying this, you know. Someone's laid a fire, isn't that nice? Scull cap. Skull cup. The man who produced my first film was called Bruce Beresford. And he used this expression whenever we got in trouble on the film, which was often. He said, "It'll be all right, we can cut away to a bunch of bananas." It was some time before I understood exactly what this meant. He'd worked for some film unit in Africa which belonged to the government, and the only films the government - who happened to be the people in power at the time - wanted to make, were films about their own speeches. So he used to have to put together these enormously long speeches by African politicians and try to make a film out of them, And of course, there are jumps. That is to say, film only lasts for ten minutes in the camera, normally. So every ten minutes you have a jump. You can demonstrate it very easily, like his... You see? If you take a bit out there there's a big jump. My head appears to jump about. Now, if you slip in a shot between those two things, then the audience accepts it more readily. They think, while the thing was on the screen that then something else happened. It's one of the little deceits that filmmakers practise. Bruce Beresford in this... in this African situation. In the middle of these politicians' speeches, just used to cut away to a bunch of bananas. Hence the expression. Now, the first time I came down to this beach, I was brought here by the man who ran the club that I worked for at um... at Abersoch. He was a man who was about 60, I suppose, and he was trying to pretend that he was much younger. He had young girlfriends, he dressed in a young manner. And to me at the age of 26 - I was a very young 26, I was very much of a prig and it seemed to me that one ought to be one's age and that one ought not to pretend that the one was younger. This man had brought me to this beach with a young girl of about 20, whom he was - in those days, in those words - courting. And I was, in a sense, playing gooseberry and was very ashamed of it, in a sense. He, as I say, was courting her, but he was trying to impress me at the same time. So when we came down here, he showed me these stratified cliffs behind me and talked about them, and then went back to her. Later, I wrote a poem about this, in which I tried to sort myself out. It's called Porth Ceiriad Bay' It's quite short, so don't go away. Porth Ceiriad Bay Descended to the shore, Odd how we left the young girl with us to herself and went straight to examine the stratified cliffs, forgot her entirely in our interest. You marvelled at the shapes the clockwork sea had worn the stone, talking keenly, until the pace of this random sculpture recalled your age to you, and then its anodynes. And so you turned, pretending youth, courting the girl as if you were a boy again, leaving the wry cliffs to their erosion and me to my observant solitude. ($ Ragtime piano music) ($ Music fades...) (Gulls screech) One of the things that happened to me down here is something that stayed with me a very long time. The place is full of images, of metaphors, of things happening. This one could, in fact, have taken place anywhere, but it happened in Lleyn and I think that's significant. I was driving from Pwliheli to Abersoch and I happened on a road accident very shortly after it had happened. There'd been a crash between, I think, two cars and a motorcycle with a pillion passenger as well as a rider. The pillion passenger had gone straight through the windscreen of the car coming in the opposite direction. And the rider of the motorcycle had been thrown across the road and had hit a wire fence of the sort which has concrete posts with holes in them and single wires through them. He'd been thrown against this wire fence and the wires had gone through him like a cheese cutter through... through cheese. You... They don't have many of them these days - a piece of wire on a board, or a piece of marble. And the wire is simply pulled through the cheese. It's a very good way of cutting cheese. I expect the machines which package cheese use the same method. But we don't see that, we just see the plastic packets. Thank God. This... The way this motorcyclist had been cut up by these wires... I passed it only fleetingly. I just drove past and saw this man in a motorcyclist helmet - and a fat lot of good that did him - lying by the side of the road having been thrown against this wire fence. And it's stayed with me, that image, that metaphor - wires going through a man like a cheese cutter through cheese - for a long while now. It's a metaphor for the way the human condition seems to treat humankind. The body as a "soft machine” as William Burroughs said. The soft machine, thrown against a wire fence, is just cut into pieces. I passed that image just in that fleeting time with that man's life ebbing away. I learnt later he'd been killed. They said instantly. But there his life was, ebbing away, and it happened in Lleyn. (5 Jolly ragtime piano music) (Music stops abruptly) The word 'gull' comes from a Welsh word 'gwylan' to wail. So a sea 'gull' in English is really the sea wailer. Wailer - I've got to use English when I talk to you. Wailer. W-A-I-L-E-R. It's a wonder we can talk at all, communicate with each other with these sort of words that have several meanings. It reminds me of a joke - everything reminds me of a joke, if I'm lucky. There was a girl who'd been taken to the pictures - remember the pictures? - by a man. And he said, "We're going to see a film about whales." And she said, "I'm not terribly keen on Taffies, as you know." He said, "No, no, no, no. Not that kind of 'whales'. "This is a film called 'Moby Dick' And she said, "I don't like sex films either." But the seagull, the wailer, the sea wailer, is a word which has different meanings in different languages very closely connected with English. For instance, in old Dutch, the word gulle, G-U-L-L-E, means a great wench without wit. This is all genuine stuff, you know. That's why I've got the script here. And there's a bloody aeroplane now. (Drones overhead) A Folland Gnat, if I'm not mistaken. ...and in old high-German, gull without an 'e', or rather low-German... I'm not making this up, you know. It's all here in the script. Gull is a soft, mild, open-hearted, good-natured sort of person. Is that your idea of a gull? (Screeching) The great Welsh poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym, wrote a poem about gulls, called 'the Seagull" I have tried to translate the first stanza of it. Erm... except, translate is the wrong word. You can... You cannot translate. You lose everything - as someone said - except the poetry. I mean, you can translate everything except the poetry. This is my attempt at the first stanza of Dafydd ap Gwilym's 'Seagull" Gull, all grace on the flood tide Mailed hand of sea salt Moonlight white, reflected snow Perfect lily of the wave's valley Fish fattened, cork-like coaster Shining sheet of paper Gull, gwylan, wailer Gull, all grace Oh! I've driven him off. He can't take my version of Dafydd. ($ Ragtime piano music) (Music fades) If I hit these stones, will it be an accident, do you think? You can't deny that that's what I'm trying to do, and I did it. But is it an accident? Why can't a film be a celebration of accidents? Why does it have to be neat and tidy and logical? Because life isn't neat and tidy and logical. Why can't a film be a celebration of the accidental? Do you have to be told a story every time? Do you have 10 be, em... do you have to have all the ends tied up so neatly? "Telling stories', if you remember, is a child's euphemism for 'telling lies'. Telling stories is telling lies. Because life doesn't tell you stories, life is accidental. If you tidy life up, you have to admit that you're falsifying it. See? Was that an accident? I think it was, actually. The thing is, telling stories is tidying life up in a way that it may not be... I'll tell you a poem. Mary had a little lamb She put it in a bucket And every time the lamb got out The bulldog tried to put it back again You see, life doesn't tell you stories like that. That's tidied life up. It is really all chaos. It is chaos. I say it is. I can't prove it is chaos any more than anyone else can prove there is a pattern or there is some sort of deity. But, even if it is all chaos, and you say, 'Let's celebrate the chaos. Let's celebrate the accidental.' Does that make us any the worse off? Are we any the worse off? There's still love. There's still humour. Umm... Mary had another lamb, she also had a duck She put it on the mantelpiece to see if it would fall off That's wrong, actually. Mary had a little lamb, she also had a duck She put THEM on the mantelpiece to see if they would fall off Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Cut. (5 Ragtime piano) (Music continues...) (Music fades) One can learn lessons from anything... Anything. One can probably even learn lessons from eating apples. Learn lessons from anything. Cheers. I'm going to read some more poems now. Erm... It may be that if you want to go and have a cup of tea, this would be a good time. I know that's what you masses are like. The mention of poetry and off you go. This one's a Welsh one, of course. It's called 'Independence' Rhiain the Gas, the Welsh introduced her - a girl who so much looked like her on whom my life had foundered, that I could not help but offer her a kind of love at sight. Rhiain once received me in her office at the Gas Co. opposite the college, to show the male her independent state and corner him on her own territory. The trouble was that just as She appeared so much like her, So she behaved the same. "Ah, yes," said lolo, some weeks later, "We should really have fold you about Rhiain.” There's something primeval about a beach, isn't there? The first poem I ever wrote was about a beach. I'm not going to recite that one though. (Gulls screech) During the time I was, um... Gregynog Fellow at University of Wales, I wrote some englynion, or, I tried to write Welsh poems that were... (Crack of explosives) World War Ill has broken out. As I was saying before I was so crudely interrupted, I tried to write englynion, Welsh poems, which are very difficult to do in English. However, here are my poor attempts. This first one is called Fern' Hookheaded hairy young fern, springy, curled, coy greeny thruster set on its own spread revelation 'Broom' Common broom confused with whin, gorse, furse, finds its own-ness in ternate leaves, coiled styles and jet black seedpods:.

(5 Ragtime piano) The third summer I spent down here was the strangest of all three, in many ways. I'd been asked to come down this time by a man I'd better call Henry, who... ...believed that the treasure ship of the Spanish Armada was somewhere out there. You're remembering the peninsula like this, the treasure ship would be about there off Abersoch. Now, you remember the Spanish Armada, 1588, it had a punch up in the Channel, and couldn't get back through the Channel to Spain, so they had to go all the way round northern Scotland past Ireland. And this man Henry's idea was, or belief it was - a religious belief almost... One of them had come down through Ireland and had run for shelter in Abersoch here and sunk in the bay. And that this one was carrying all the, er... ...all the treasure to pay the mercenaries in the Spanish fleet. The whole Spanish army. So he got me here... Ahem, can I have your attention, please? Just a moment, come back, please. This is an interesting story. This man Henry got me here for the whole summer with the promise of skin-diving down off Abersoch with the promise of untold millions of gold doubloons and pieces of eight and all those romantic things. When I actually got here, I found that he hadn't got a boat and he hadn't got any sort of skin-diving equipment. There was nothing we could do. It was just a romantic story. Do you mind! This is an interesting story I'm telling you. You keep wandering off. Anyone would think we were making a film for the masses where they have to be entertained every second. This man Henry had a cottage. But it was very full up with his wife and children and things, so he put me in a sort of caravan at a field called Dwyran. Now Dwyran is a very strange place. As I've said before, again and again, this is a... The whole of Lleyn is a strange place. Dwyran is a place where you had to be very careful what you did with your toenail cuttings. Now I used to cut mine and keep them in a little pile and eventually I buried them in a stone wall. That seemed the safest thing to do. That third summer seemed to mark some sort of a climacteric in my life and I wrote a poem about it. In the ember days of my last free summer, here [ lie, outside myself watching the gross body eating a poor curry:. Satisfied at what [ have done, scared of what I have to do in my last free winter. A bit portentous. You could charge people to watch this, 25p a head. Anyone with two heads, 40p. Cut away to a bunch of bananas. ($ Ragtime piano music) Come along, this way. Curious things to see. Curious things to see. Come along. Ah! Not so fast. Not so much. Down boy. Down, down. That's a good boy. Sit. Now, very gently, come and see the curious things. Curious things, well worth seeing. Look, one there, and another one there. I think they've been making all these footprints. Do you see them all? And what's that thing? Is anyone at home, one wonders? Hello? Hello? Anyone at home? No. Ah, a sliver of the moon. A representation of the moon. Here's a light... Another sort of light. Isn't it good? Look. And here are heels. Perhaps they helped make the footprints. That one's been ground into the ground by another heel. And here, a paperclip! My favourite. Look, a paperclip. A lovely paperclip. And here a Schweik. Here's what you've all been waiting for. It's Schweik in his bunker. The good soldier Schweik. Isn't he sweet? We all love him. And over here, careful not to trip now. Don't trip on the banana skins. There! Did you enjoy that? Did you enjoy seeing the curious things? Here's a little present for you then. Good boy, good boy. Sit! Sit! Right, off you go and have a run round by yourself. Off you go. Bye bye. (Ragtime music continues...) (Music fades) Some things can only be said indirectly. They can only be... One can only reflect the truth of what they were. I'm not quite sure that I know the truth about this particular thing that I want to talk about indirectly. There's a mountain called Garn Fadrun on Lleyn. It's the last mountain towards the tip of the peninsular which can be called a mountain, that is, it's over 1,000 feet tall. I found myself one morning at dawn on top of that mountain, almost not of my own volition, and stripping off all my clothes, and making what I can only think of as religious gestures, worshipping some sort of female deity. Now, I'm not a religious person, I can't explain how that happened, or why I felt the need to do it. It's... That's the sort of place Lleyn is. I feel like I feel nowhere else on earth, here in Lleyn. And doing that sort of thing, that archetypal... Jung calls the archetype. Something that we do despite the last two or three thousand years of civilisation. There's a much longer period with archetypal patterns of behaviour inside us that we respond to sometimes, in certain places. And Garn Fadrun must have been the same way for hundreds of thousands of years. Lleyn, in many ways, has been that sort of place for many hundreds of thousands of years. Cut. (Piano music resumes...) I think that will probably be enough of that. (Drone of helicopter) (Director) Go ahead. I think there have probably been at least two films trying to get out of this one film. And if you feel that you don't really know much more about the Lleyn Peninsular at the end of it, well, that's probably because I don't know much more about the Lleyn Peninsular either. One has to live here and be born here for a long while before one can begin to understand the strange sort of place it is. But at least we haven't pretended to be doing anything than making a film about it, about that problem. And we have, at the same time, tried to be honest to film itself. But, in the end, Lleyn ought to be left to the Welsh, to them. We ought to go. You can go. Off you go! Up, up up, up, up, up... ($ Scott Joplin: "The Entertainer") (Music fades)
