Due sips, that way. Swallow. Girl of the cabbages, that you so much cry... What? He doesn’t take his meds? - He doesn't. - He says they're awful. Get up and take the meds. I took them. Get up, you didn't. Get up, we've been calling you for a while now. Come on, get up. - He's numb. - Did you drink your water? Did he eat? - Eat? Yes. - He didn't! Give him some water. Here, have a sip. - Was he still sleeping? - Does he sleep all day? - He doesn't want to get up? - I'm numb, I can't stand up. Let me feel your pulse. Here, we'll put you on a drip tomorrow. - Your legs hurt? - Yes, I can't walk. I'll come back tomorrow, if you’re still feeling bad we'll put you on a drip. - I stand up and I'm out of breath. - It's been a while since he got up! Song Shengyong: hospitalized for 20 years. Zhao Jiaping: hospitalized for 10 years. To bed, to bed, to bed, to bed. It'd be better to be at home, wouldn't it? Brother? It's New Year's soon. That is sure... I can only think straight when I'm at home. I miss my family, a lot. What kind of rules are these? We'll soon be home, brother. We pray this way, brother. That's our Hui tradition. Isn't it, brother? We sing and pray. - Soon enough me and my brother will go back home. - Right. - I miss home. - Yea. Oh, there's only a car going east, but many are going west. I could leave whenever I wanted to. There's a car that was just turned on and left. Ah! I could steal a car, but I won't do that. I respect the law. Come on, get up. You promised you'd help me in front of your wife. - Come on, I'll get you up. - No, please! - Wait for me to lift you up. - Please, no. He's numb. - Get up, come on! - Put my blankets back on. - Come on! - The blankets! - So stubborn. - Leave me alone! How can you even get asleep? You smoke too much, Ma Lianrong, you'll end up suffocating, if you sleep this way. Turn around, at least. Go away, I need to sleep! My belly still hurts, fuck. Doctor... Doctor my belly hurts. How can these be serious doctors? Are they even public service employees? Public service? Is this even public service? - Doctor! - Yes? Doctor! Open the door, I'm going downstairs. You really are great doctors! Before throwing me in here I wasn't ill now I really am. Nurse! This one has a code I don’t know. I need to knock three times. Nurse! - Nurse! - Yes? Give me back my scarf, my brother is coming. I'm leaving this place. Come on, nurse, be hasty I'm waiting, I'm numb and I don't want to stay here. You need money for the bus, I don't have that. I'll get on the front seats, that way I won't pay. I don't have money for the bus! It makes no sense to stay here, really. - Nurse! - Yes? Be quick with my scarf! Tomorrow! But I want to go home! They told me it'd have been today, call them and check, nurse. Nurse, I'm going home, come on! - Are you sitting on the sofa? - No. - And what about your two daughters? - What? Your two daughters, the little ones. - I don't want to talk about it. - You don't want to? I need a wife... I'm feeling well, nurse, I'll go back to bed. Have you seen those no-good doctors, they're good at wasting electricity, even I'm better than them. Energy saving... Who the fuck cares? I wanna go home, who is more homesick than me? How the fuck did I end up like this? I don't even have money for the bus. I'll take it off. It's too hot. Ma Jian: hospitalized for 5 months. It's too hot, I'm sweating. Do you have any to spare, brother? I'll put them here. These are enough. I'll leave the better ones. - If you want I can give you some of my stuff. - No, I'm good. - Tangerines? - I got some, I even have husks. - Give me one, brother. - I don't have any. I want to study, I'll start studying. I'll do the officials exam. Give me your book, that way I can study. I got 2 "Hong he" packets, but I only need one. "Yunyan" and "Yinxiang" cigarettes, and how did they end up here? So weird. What kind of brand is this? "Nanzhen" or something. I'll go for a run. I'll take this off. I'll go for a run. I'll put my stuff here. I'll surely sweat with these jeans on. I'll start slowly. I'll do 20 fucking laps. 20 laps, or at least 15. They're chasing me! They want to kill me! Fuck, you're all sweaty as well. That's enough, I'm already tired and sweaty. One more! A full one more! Felt like flying! I'm the only one not sleeping in this hospital. I'll wake them up. Mao'er, massage by back, it really hurts. Please! Mao'er, a proper nice massage! - Go run again. - What? Come on, go run again! No, you do that. I've ran enough. - Come on, brother, run with me. - No, no, put your clothes back on! Alright. I took it easy today. But I was kind of fast, wasn't I? Brother? My mother bought me these, but they're hard to put on, and so I have to put the strings inside. It'd be better to put it on or I'll get sick, you don't want to get sick here. My head itches, some asshole stole my shampoo. What kind of life is this? It hurts like hell today, in days like these, I'd rather be dead. The pain doesn't make you want to live. How much lives I got? Nine! How many paths can a man take? This is truly a dead end. This sucks, how can anyone live like this? You could even butcher me, like a chicken or a cow. Come on, kill me. Here he is! What the fuck are you doing here? Get lost! You come here to scrounge cigarettes and food, don't you? I can't kill him! What kind of hospital is this? Want to see me kick it up to the wall? Shitty hospital! You're in trouble, boy. Have no fear, my brother will pay. - Help me getting it up. - How? Shit. What a shitty bed. Come on, help us out. Lift, lift! Leave it, I'm not a lumberjack! What a shitty bed. Do I jump on it? Hey! Don't break it! You'll end up badly! And who says that? Get off! - Ma Jian! - Si! What? No, I wasn't jumping, I just kicked the wall. If we have to replace it, it'll be two thousands yuan. - And what if I find a job and pay it back? - You can't. - I'll go out and earn some money. - You can't. I go back home and in one month, I'll earn 2,000 yuan. You don't go home, you take the meds if you don't break anything, then we'll see I want a shot. Here, on the left. - Ma Jian, your shot. - Alright. - Where do I stand? - Here is fine. Will the injection stun me? It will make you feel good. Yes, I'm ill, I'm having attacks. - For real, doctor, I'm having attacks. - Yes, and it's also time to punish you. - I'm having attacks. I know my illness. - Do you? Yes. I got epilepsy. My cousin has it, too. It's just that mine is worse, and I'm older. Be gentle, doctor, don't hurt me too much. Doctor, I want to go home. - You'll give me a shot and I'll go home, right? - One injection and we're done. - You're powerful. - That's not true. - Give me the injection. - Turn around. - Here, where my hand is. - I little lower than that. One day we'll give you two shots in your mouth! Don't be like that, doctor. - Will you behave now? - Yes, I swear. Do you promise not to jump anymore on beds? He jumped on the bed and broke it. - When? - A few moments ago. Doctor, I want to go home. - You can stand up. - Alright. I'll eat some spaghetti, otherwise I'll get home on an empty stomach and my mother will think that they starve me here. Throw it away. Go away. - Much better. - Did you insult me? Me? No! It was that bastard. I want to leave but they won't let me. I'm going to bed. I'll take a look in here. Six beds, all full. I'd better get into mine. Fuck! I can't believe it. Whose is this bed? Get up! Get up! I told you to get up! What? Get up! Out of my bed! Get up or I'll beat your ass! Quick! Unbelievable! Be fucking quick! I want to sleep! Move or I'll get mad and you'll get hit! How the fuck can you make such a big mess out of other's beds! He threw all the clothes on the floor, fuck. To bed! If someone annoys me again he's gonna get a beating. Fucking shoes! How can they say they're gym shoes? And these fucking shoelaces that never stay tied. The blankets touch the ground. They were clean as well, fucking hell. Don't dare to sleep in my bed. The next one that annoys me is gonna get hit. To bed! Shithead, inside my bed... Who do you think you are! If the asshole still talks, I'll get up and kill him. There's really a lot of snow this year. Li, I'm coming! Don't mind her, she's just talking nonsense. They won't bring us anything with this snow. You talk nonsense! You! The ninth sister is a beautiful girl... The ninth sister is a beautiful girl... What are your plans after the 15th? It's me! It's me! That's me! We'll have fun during New Year's days. When it's snowing it's less cold than when snow melts, I studied chemistry. Maybe Zhu Shengfen wasn't a professor? Maybe Xie Xichen wasn't manufacturing coffins? I walk here everyday! I know your every move, always! The chiefs are busy, how are they gonna deal with you? Oh! I fear that my family wants to kill the pig. Xiong Yong's family's pig was fat as his father was always feeding it Cao Likun took take of the pig for two years, but not the third one. Here you eat, stay comfortable and sleep, if possible, no one will annoy you. If someone is crazy, he's crazy. But is he? I remember that we had a professor, he used to behave like this. Cao Tingkun: hospitalized for 15 years. Speaking about killing the pig, I'm fine with it. It's meat after all. Have you never eaten meat? I bet that you never baked any ham. You can bake hams all year. Or freeze them. There's nothing for you, today. Nothing. Ma Jian! Come get your stuff! Coming! Fuck. There should be some milk as well. - I'll check again, come back later. - Alright. Bring it to me when she finds it. Do you wanna trade some of it for my cigarette? Ma Dianrong: hospitalized for 12 years. Give me one, don't be a scrooge! He has his snacks wrapped up in his shirt! - Come on, friend! - I want this one, I don't care about the others. - Give me one, let's trade. - I'm saving them. Give me one, I'll give you a cigarette. You have yours. But yours are better! See how he shows off. Give me one, for fuck's sake. I'll go to the supermarket and buy a mountain of those! Here. Only that? Ah, give me that, give me that! Just like stealing food from pigs. - What? - Give it back! - Why don't you suck my dick? - Give it back. What do you want? My coat? Do you want the coat? Hell no! You should have told me so when I asked you. - Just a little! - Here, take! - Just a bit more. - Here, now get the fuck out! You think I can't fight you? I'll kill you! You'll die this time. The day when I'll kill you will come. Fuck you and your mother, round-faced guy! Wu Shensong: hospitalized for 3 years. I can't sleep. Can't you at least try? I don't think I can. Enough counting. I'll write a bit. "Virtuous thought". Thought... Virtuous tho... thought. "Virtuous thought". Go, go. Ask if you have to. I'll sneak off, but you can ask. Are you going to sit here? So what? - The door is locked. Doctors are eating. - Don't annoy them then. Why are you running? Why the fuck are you running? Is your belly still swollen? No. It sure is. Is it a lot swollen? Sit down, you'll feel better. It says: "Thanks, Mate". Don't hit me! If my family doesn't come see me, I'll fucking kill you. I'll fucking kill you. No swearing! - What? - No swearing. Swearing...! I'll bite off your ear and eat it. Don't pull so hard, asshole, you'll hurt me. Do you want me to ask the doctor for some antacids? Go ask. - I bet she never has indigestion. - Go ask. Let's swap clothes! Marry me! You're so silly. Your skin is coarse. Tin XingCai: hospitalized for 7 years. If I don't eat... I'll... starve. Did you write that on your legs? There a lot of writings. Look, my skin is so thin that I can scrap it away. Don't cover it! It's cold. Do I have to ask? - Ask for them. - Or you help me ask. Stop fucking hitting me. I'm not a punching bag, asshole. Your skin is so coarse. I tore up your blood vessel. Stop annoying me or I'll hit you back. Stop annoying me. - Fight me! - You fight me! I've hurt my ass. I do all this work to get him clean clothes and he never wears them. The doctors always yell at me. - Why is that? - Because he doesn't have clean clothes. - Come on, undress. - What time is it? Soon to be four. There's still time. - It's just that... - Excuses. Come on, everyone get out he needs to get changed! No more excuses. Can't you ask the chief for help? - He won't listen to me. - Really? I'll get you to him so you can see how much he hates me! Get changed, quick. I brought you clean clothes and underwear. And not even a little bit of food... I can't afford that! Half a kilo of potatoes is two yuan. - That much? - Do you think I'm kidding you? I can get you potatoes for 1,5 yuan! - I want those with they yellow husk. - Which are those? I can get out a kilo of big ones. You don't know anything about potatoes, what would you know about husks! Let me be, I'll do on my own. Fuck off, I don't need your help! I can undress on my own. Do you see how handsome he is? So handsome. You should button up. I know how to button up. Not that one! Let me put it on you! Alright, alright. Look how handsome you are, all dressed up. Take off your trousers. Not my pants. That too! Porn movie, porn movie! It's a porn movie! It's turning into a horror movie! No, come on, it's not that bad. They're too small! No. It's OK this way, leave it. Fuck. Didn't you bring him some extra clothes? Extra clothes? No. I could just bring those. I'll have to clean the dirty ones in boiling water. You can leave them in the disinfectant for a while. - I'll rest a bit. - Alright, rest. - Throw it away! - No, I'll drink it! You're not allowed to drink tea. There are people drinking tea all day and of the best brands. In the end drinking tea is better than smoking. Could you borrow me some yuan? Don't you try that with me! I'm already spending 20 or 30 years a day to keep him here. - You're getting out soon, right? - Sure. Is Chao growing up? Did he learn how to speak? - What do you think? - He's twelve, so I think he can. - He can say "Dad used to hit me". - He remembers me? Yea, he remembers you hitting him! You should go home for New Year's. It's up to her, otherwise I need to stay here. You can have a good New Year's here too You didn't bring me any fruits. What? I can't afford fruit. It doesn't matter. Your grant is three months late. It should come arrive every month! - Where is it then? - Find out. We need to wait till Monday then I can go to the Civil Affairs office. Why the Civil Affairs? Because they are the ones paying so they are the ones to ask to. - You need to explain them... - Explain what? It's a little more than the 100 yuan a month and that's not enough to pay for your stay here. - You need to reason with them. - Oh really? You can't even buy a bag of rice with 100 yuan. You need to learn how to deal with them. Yes, I need to learn how to deal with them. What does Ma Chao eat? Does he eat twice a day? - If his brother doesn't forget to feed him. - Does he? - Can't he take the food from the fridge himself? - We sold the fridge. - Don't bullshit me. - I'm serious. - Who bought that old thing? - I sold it for 100 yuan. You can't be serious, it was worth at least 1,000! - It was busted. - Busted? Come here, let me fix you. How can a new fridge be busted? - It wasn't new. - What? Stop arguing! Sit down! Alright. - Do you take your meds? - Of course! - Really? - Really. I got a lot of money left. Pretend like I didn't ask you anything. You don't stay in that room anymore? No, it's way better here. Director Cao himself transferred me. He must have grown fond of you. When the doctors get back from the holidays, you can take me home for New Year's. I can stay home for a month or two, whatever it's needed. They'll keep my spot here, so no problem at all. Later I could get back here or not. Ma Yunde: hospitalized for 12 years. Meng Youlian: Ma Yunde's wife. Open the door! Let's go! - Can we go downstairs? - Not yet. Come on, let's go! Don't worry, I can do it on my own. Do you want my leftovers? Yes, yes. Ops! Sorry. Hey, don't eat that stuff! Ma Yonglian: hospitalized for 2 months. Go away! Out of my bed! Out! Everyone to his own bed! These beds are for one person, two won't fit. - Just for a while. - No! - Just for a little bit. - Did you hear what I said? - Just a little bit. - Go away. - Go away. - If you let me stay here I'll get you food... - Stop with Th bullshit! Go sleep in your bed. Asshole. One per bed. Hey! Get off. - Asshole! - Seriously, go away. OK, alright, good night. What's the fucking matter? - I don't want you in my bed. - I'm not that heavy. When I was studying in Kunming, me and my girlfriend used to hug all the time. We used to go biking during spring, to places where we could be alone. Sometimes the spring comes back, you know? So I will sleep with you. - The bed might break. - It won't happen. - And even if it breaks, - who cares. Just because a man has wrinkles or a grizzled beard, it doesn't mean that his youth has ended. There are still flowers to pick up and birds to catch, right? - I've had my share of birds. - More than those you actually had, right? How much money do you have? Shi Guangdiao: hospitalized for 2 years. 500.000 or 600.000 yuan. - So much? - Yes Zeng Weichen: hospitalized for 15 years. With those you can buy 5 wives. No! As if 100.000 yuan were enough to buy one! - They're not that cheap! - Aren't they? You could buy a young one. Even if they were 200.000 yuan each, I could buy a couple, one for me and one for you. - With 200.000 you could buy a cute one. - Yes. 400.000 yuan for two wives, 200.000 for you, exactly 600.000. - A nice car as well. - We should be at least 3 for that. The wives could contribute. Have you ever had a wife? No, never. - I thought you had. - No. I never got married. Do you have any sons? Or daughters? Yes, many. Taxes are too expensive. "Shui" as in "taxes", the taxes we have to pay? No, "Shui" as in "sleep"! "Shui" as in "sleep"? What? No, that's not true. - It's "Shui" as in "pay taxes". - Yes, that's right, the same for "Taxation Office". I can't afford to pay taxes. They're too expensive. You know that, right? But at least you can afford to sleep. Too bad that when you wake up taxes are still there to be paid! I will sleep through all the sleep I can afford. My parents were honest people, but honesty doesn't pay you taxes. People like us can only afford to sleep. We can sleep at least. - Sleeping is for free. - Yes, they can't tax sleeping. Move! - Let go! - No. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? I tried to explain it to you, but you won't listen. - What's happening? - Come here! What's happening? Come and see for yourself. And get your hands off me. I'm not even allowed to make a call now? Not during the night. You can make a call during day. - I forgot to. - No call then. - Just one call? - Move. Let me make just one call. Open the door, OK? Why should I? I'll get back when I'm done, I swear. Come downstairs, let's see if we can reason with you. He's getting a beating. He's getting a beating. Doctor! Remove my handcuffs! Quick, before I pass out! Doctor! Do you think they're going to come if you keep yelling? Keep on going, so they'll handcuff your feet as well. Yin Tianxing: hospitalized for a month. I can't take this anymore. Remove them, please. What? - I can't take this. - Do they hurt? Stop kicking doors then! It wasn't me. Remove them. You did. My chest hurts. - Oh, really? - Yes. Weren't you the one who told me you'd hit me because I've hit you? You're not so tough anymore, are you? I'm begging you. Beg as much as you want. I don't have the keys. - Someone took them. - You have them... - My hands really hurt, doctor. - I told you already, I don't have the keys. I saw you taking them. Someone else took them again. Remove my handcuffs, please. My arms are killing me. - I'll go look for them. - The faster, the better. You're going to behave from now on. - Kicking doors won't help you. - I know, I won't do that again. Can't you hurry up, doctor? It really hurts! Just a moment, then I'll go downstairs to look for the keys. Alright. I'd be glad if you did. You weren't so grateful before, were you? Go away now. Please... Are you deaf? I told you to leave. Did you hear what I said? - I'm just asking... - And I'm asking you to leave! Please, I can barely breathe! If you don't shut up and you don't stop annoying me, I won't go looking for the keys. Go take a nap and later I'll go get the keys. I can't sleep like this. I don't care if you can't sleep, stop being around. I'm tired of seeing you. Please, doctor, be quick. I'm asking you once again. Alright, I'll go ask someone else. As you like. No one will help you. Come here! It's better if you rest a bit and stay out of trouble. - Two shots. - Really? Yes, double dose today. - Who's this for? - Wu Shensong. Come take your shot! - Wu Shensong! - Come take your injection! Ah, here he is! Here's the injection, Young Master Wu. - He wanted one for the toothache. - Yes, he asked for one yesterday. Not so many patients ask for injections. They usually prefer pills. Injections hurt too much. Well done. I didn't hurt you too much, did I? - Can you give me something for the toothache? - Like a slap? Maybe it's the mumps. You can never get enough. One shot, then you turn around and ask for another one! You offer the other cheek... I think I'll take a nap. Rest. I'll go take a nap. Me too. Liu Gangxian: hospitalized for 6 years. What's the matter? Two little shots and look at yourself. Go to sleep, to sleep. Boy? Boy? Go rest. Why don't you answer to me? Were those two injections that strong? Two shots and look at him. It's not only that. He got beaten up. Someone accused him of stealing stuff from another room. Today? No, yesterday or the day before. He got beaten up yesterday. That's why he's like this today. Stand up! I'll give you a cigarette if you stand up! He just stands there like an idiot... It's been hours since the injection! Get up! Stop staying there like a demented man. Sleep! Stop being an idiot. Being held up in here for too long really makes you mentally sick. I mean, seriously mentally ill. Even if you didn't break the law, they can lock you up here, 24 hours a day. Check the admission registry and you'll understand. It's illegal. Illegal and thoughtless. Most of the people here have been brought it because of fights. - Which one is his bed? - This one. Take off his shoes. Is he dead? - No, he's pretending. - You don't know that. The heart beat is good. Let's let him rest for a while. Call me if something happens. My tooth hurts. I think it's rotten. Can you tell the doctor? Alright. Alright? No, you can't leave. You stay here. Get him a bed. We'll find you a nice roommate that is from the same town, alright? Don't let him go! Liu Rong, come back here! Get back here! Come on, let's go. Get some rest, you'll feel better. Everything will be OK. No... Get him. Lui Dailong... Where is Luo Dailong? He's sleeping. That bastard! Don't let him escape again. Let's take him to bed. What the fuck, come on. - Shut up, you'll wake everyone up! - Be quiet, people are sleeping. Go to bed. Calm down and go to bed. Look, you have your own bed and you have a friend from the same town. It will be fine. - Enough. - Rest now, OK? Let him be. Go lay down on your pillow. Or go watch some TV. Let him walk it off. He will feel better afterward. How could you bring me here? Go to bed. Crying won't help. It was the same for us as well, but we didn't cry. It's a nightmare... It's a fucking nightmare... I'm not crazy, get me out of here! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Liu Rong, how could you do this to me? Why don't you answer? Chen Zhuanyuan: just arrived. Why did you bring me here? Go to bed. Turn off the lights. If he turns them off, he won't be able to see us. Go to the TV room and ask the doctor to open the door. - Leave the package! - Go to the TV room. You have to go to the room TV: Tell him you have visitors. In the TV room, go look for the doctor in the TV room. Help him, he doesn't know where to go. Where's the doctor? Help him, he's new. He's not in here. Downstairs, with the white coat. Doctor, someone has visitors! Don't come in. Wait there until I find a doctor, OK? Wait, I'll try calling them. Mom just wants the best for you! I just wanted to visit you alone to make sure you were fine. Don't hate mom. She did it for your own good. And when you'll feel better, she'll take you home, and grandma and the rest will be there. Do what the doctors tell you. Alright. Do you want to talk to mom? I'll call her. No, no, go home. Do you have your room, your bed? How many are there in your room? - I'm sharing the room with them. - He has his own bed. - They're good with me, don't worry. - Are they good with you? We're all roommates. Maybe you could buy him cigarettes. Smoking helps killing time. No, I don't smoke anymore. Get her to buy something else, something to eat. Some biscuits or fruit. Who makes your laundry? - We do it ourselves. - Do you? I'll make your laundry, dad, OK? - Buy him food and cigarettes. - Do you want cigarettes, dad? - He doesn't smoke. Get him food, instead. - I don't need anything. - Tell Song to get me out of here. - You have to ask mom for that! No, no... Don't come in, don't come in. OK. Li Fa is here as well. Uncle and grandfather know him. I got some roommates that are from our town. So don't worry about me. Mom says that you can come back home as soon as you'll feel better. Don't worry, really... Mom is calling. Hello mom, dad is here. Do you want to talk to mom? Here. - No. - Talk to her! - No... - It's mom! Talk to her! What's up? Why did you send Mei? You should have come. No, don't come. You're so busy at home. Don't worry about the demolitions guys. We can't do much about it. Take care of the kids. Tell my daughter-in-law to bring the meds to Daotu. Ask Chen Xingcong. He knows Daotu. And talk to the village officials. You have everyone's contact, and my daughter-in-law can help you. Don't forget to call Qiang, OK? Do you want to make a call? Tell me the number. Hello, am I talking to Chen Jinsong's father? Your son wants to talk to you. Speak in there. Father? Why didn't you come visit me yet? It's New Year's soon. In some days? In some days? You said that the last time as well. I want to go home. Oh... I don't like it here. I want to go back home. Come get me, dad. Oh... - Thanks, young lady. - No problem. Dad? - Come on, go. - Do you need food? - What? - Do you need food? I don't need anything. Come on, go. You're having a nervous breakdown. You'll soon be home, OK?

I'll get out of here when I'm dead. - Tell them to open the door. - So much stuff! Open the door! He's been here for 11 years. We had to pay everything by ourselves. The state didn't give us a single cent. - It must have been really expensive. - And not even a cent from the state. Will he get back here? - What? - Will he get back here? We asked for a 10 days permit, if he gets sick again he can come back here. - Did you get all your stuff? - Yes. - You'll have a nice shower and you'll fill up your belly. - That's for sure. - And don't forget about us. - I won't.

It's full of saliva. - Are you thinking about something? - Sure. - About what? - What do you think I'm thinking about? - You tell me. - Locked in here, all I can do is thinking. - Tell me then. - It's not a matter of telling or not. - If you're thinking about something, tell me. - And how do I do that? If you don't talk how can I know? I can't read minds. - I know. - Talk then. - I want to know your plans. - I don't know. - How can you not know? - That's the reason I'm asking you! I think you should take me home. Seems like you don't understand the reason why I had to bring you here, so I'm worried about what would happen if I brought you home. - That's the reason why I should go back home! - And what would that be? - It's hard to explain! - Oh, it's hard. - Really, take me home. - No. - Don't be silly. - You need to rest. - This is not resting. - It's worse at home.

They don't need you to see them. - Don't they? - No, they don't. - One day it will be too late. - Too late for what? - Little by little you'll understand but it will be too late. - How long have you been here? - Two years. - Give me some. - What?

Remove the plastic first. - Can you give me one tangerine? - What do I get in exchange? I got some tea. Is that OK? Here, old freeloader. And this is for the young one. Do you want one? Yes. Here. I thought you'd never ask. Come, Cat. Thanks, old man. - He called you old man. - That's cute. And who knew you had such an old son? - Can you give me another one? - You already had enough. Give him one. Doctors didn't change your blankets? They did, but I messed them up. Yeah, you did. They're all crumpled. Is this OK? Yea, it's fine. No, they're not yet. - Do you take your meds? - Of course I do. - How many daily? - 7 or 8. You're not sure? 7 or 8... This medicine is tastier. It’s little bit sweet. Not like your bitter wife! No, she's sweet as well. Lift your tongue. OK. - Did you feel the earthquake just now? - Earthquake? - He said he felt the earthquake. - We didn't feel it up here. Maybe you dreamed of it! Hey! Where are you going? - Nowhere? - What? Nowhere. Why are you still awake after they turned off the lights? My hands hurt. I don't know why. Why don't you go to a doctor? I'll try caress them. Can I come down to see you? Stop it. Enough. Go away, Mute! Go away, please. I want to sleep comfortable. Go away, Mute! Get up. Go away! We don't want you in our bed. If you sleep here, I'll sleep outside. There not enough space for the three of us. - I can't sleep well this way. - I don't give a fuck. Go away! Get lost. It's too crowded. I'll hit you! I'll hit you! I'll hit you! I'll hit you! Hit me, hit me... I want to sleep. Is your mother still alive? She died a long ago. Many years ago? You told me already, didn't you? - Are you afraid that her ghost will haunt you? - Why would she? Do you think people turn into ghosts when they die? She could do that if she feared that you'd never go back home, if she feared that you'd be all alone... Don't say silly stuff, you're such a silly boy.
