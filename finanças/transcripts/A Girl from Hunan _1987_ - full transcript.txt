Congratulations! Your daughter? My niece. Oh, your niece. Buy yourself a drink. I couldn't. Please, it's good luck. I'm afraid it's not much. - Where are you from? - Chenguan Village. - Where are you going? - Yang Clan Village. That's 10 miles up the mountains. Xiaoxiao! Hungry? Eat slowly, don't choke. Stop a moment! Please stop! What is it? I want to get down. You can't till we arrive. I've got to take a piss. Please put it down. Take a rest over there. I'm bursting! How much further? It won't be so nice there, but you must be grown up and obey. OK, let's go on. Have you seen Chunguan? He was just here. Chunguan! Chunguan! What are you doing here? You drive me nuts! She's nearly here. You've got your clothes all dirty. Don't cry. Here. Mute, come here. Get me the sedan. The joining of two names. The bride is here. The rooster's blood ensures them luck. Bow! Start the music! Enter! Light candles for the bridal chamber so the new couple will be happy. Chunguan, Chunguan! Stop it, it's your wedding day. Go get the rooster. Bow to Heaven! To our ancestors! To your parents! To each other! Enter the bridal chamber. I'm tired, give me some. Don't cry. Don't cry. I'll kiss you. Now you kiss me. Disgusting! Kissing! Someone's died. I feel so sorry for her! 'Yuanfang' just 2 years, and now a widow. So young, and she can't remarry. What does 'Yuanfang' mean? You'll find out. Eat up, you're still growing. I was Zuzhang's servant at your age and we never got this rubbish then. What's a 'Zuzhang'? That's a headman. Everyone around here called Yang is under his rule. If anyone does us wrong he takes them to court. If a Yang break the clan rules he decides their fate. He's so powerful! Aren't you going to feed the pigs? Hello, Mute. Mama! Mama! Go to Xiaoxiao. So big, and you still want milk. Aren't you ashamed in front of Xiaoxiao? I'll teach you when you're grown up. That's enough. Go out and play with Xiaoxiao. Let's look at the moon together. Where the moon goes, I will follow. The big round moon, it's so hollow. Where the moon goes, I will follow. Up in the air, like a swallow. Where the moon goes, I will follow. The big round moon, it's so hollow. Sister! Where are you? Sister! Chunguan! You scared your sister! You're my wife! Disgusting! I'll pull your hair! How dare you run away? Hello, Qiaxiu Niang. You're taller and plumper. I just scared her by acting like a tiger. Is your mother-in-law good to you? Yes. She gives me plenty to eat. Don't be mean to her. Let's go. I want 2 days off after plowing. Can you lend me some more money? I won't gamble it away this time. I want to see a show in town. Come and take a break. That little virgin is filling out. She's full grown now. Let's take a look. Huagou, catch! Mute, catch. Sing us a song, Chunguan. *Up in the skies, clouds are billowing.* *Down in the corn, pea plants are growing.* *Tendrils wrap tight 'round every stem.* *Maidens wrap tight 'round all the men.* Was it good? Yes, who taught you? Uncle Huagou. I'll teach you if you want, Xiaoxiao. Let's go, Chunguan. *On the pathway, Xiaoxiao is singing a song.* *Xiaoxiao's breasts are bobbing along.* *They'd be so soft to feel and touch.* *I can't, and my heart beats so much.* You've eaten too much. Xiaoxiao, come rub his stomach. Hi, Grandpa. How many shows did you see in town? None, I just got a haircut. Oh, I saw some girl students. Girl students! Were they in sedan chairs? What were they doing? It's summer vacation. They were on their way home. What are girl students? Are they pretty? Oh, they're charming! They don't have pigtails. They look a bit like nuns, and dress like foreigners. They just read foreign books, sing songs and play sports. They spend an awful lot. Enough to buy a dozen buffaloes a year. How can they afford that? What were they wearing? I'll tell you. White, shortsleeved blouses, made of imported cloth, and black skirts, this long. Their arms and legs were white, exposed for people to see. Don't their in-laws object? What do you know? They get married to the male students they study with without go-betweens or betrothal gifts. If they like someone, they make friends. Sinful! How can they ignore clan rules? They say it's called "freedom". What's the world coming to? Xiaoxiao, is freedom good? Yes... No. Take me next time, I want to see them. You want to become a girl student? No, no. You look like one. No, I don't! He's right, you're sure to become one. OK, I'm not afraid. Worse and worse. Put Chunguan to bed. Let's go. She's still so childish. She just plays all day. She's still young. Young? She's 16 already. Her breasts are full, but she doesn't bind them. Make sure you get a good price. I want to go, too. Your uncle's going to town. You go play with Xiaoxiao. OK, let him go. Xiaoxiao! Take care of him. Sing a song, Uncle Huagou. *Three maple trees, all the same.* *Under the leaves, lover's lane.* *Many girls to whom I've spoken,* *Now I've countless love tokens.* That's the headman going to clan hall. Wait for us, Xiaoxiao. We'll be right back. Let's go. I want this one. I'm broke, wait for Uncle. Girl students! They don't even wear knickers. Chunguan? - Chunguan! - I'm over here. How did you get over here? No, thanks. Let's go. This is from Huagou. He said not to tell my Mom. Huagou said you smell nice. He stinks. What about me? You? You smell of piddle. No, I don't. I'm grown up now. Yes, you're an adult now. Come in a moment, Xiaoxiao. Try these. They're too small. No, they're not. Her feet are unbound, but she doesn't feel ashamed. Here. Flowers! Maybe we can't afford to get married, but we can drink and have some fun. I'll return your money after harvest. Come here, Xiaoxiao. Turn around. So big, and you don't bind them. Put this on every day. Mind your own business. It's raining, let's hurry. Chunguan! Come here and sit down. Don't go, let's play! It's raining. It's thundering. Crabs and frogs are singing. Your shoulders are big. So's your chest. You'll be like me in 10 years. I'll be 16 then. It's hard to wait ten years. Go see if it's still raining, Chunguan. It isn't, Uncle. Let's go, Xiaoxiao. Can you see my buffalo? - Give it this to eat. - This is pig fodder. Buffaloes eat it, too. Hurry up. Sister! Sister! Sister! My hand hurts. I've been stung. Sister! Go away, you're still a child. No, I'm grown up now! I'll tell my mom you hit me. You scared me. Over here, quick. That's the young widow. Here, sister. Look, your pants are torn again. Where did you get these? I picked them. You did? I've got lots more. They're terribly sour. Pregnant? Are you sure? Get rid of it. Do you know a doctor? Let's run away! Let's go to town to be free. We can become servants. Impossible. We don't know anyone in town. There are even rules for beggars. You don't care, it's all your fault! I never meant this to happen. So what? Help me get rid of it! I'm afraid! It's OK. Your husband will come back. Is my Dad coming back? Yes. Go see what's going on. - What's up? - They caught a couple. - Who? - Qiaoxiu Niang committed adultery. Isn't that the blacksmith from Huangluo? Her brother-in-law caught them. Look how they've broken our clan rules. We've been after them for days. Beat them, beat them good and hard. We should break his legs, so he can't do it again. Give me a hand, Huagou. All Of One Root You're our clan elder. How should we punish this whore? According to our clan rules. Ask her family. Either drown her, or if they're shameless, sell her off. That would be too nice. She's disgraced us. We must be strict. The headman's waiting at the lake. Take her clothes off and drown her. Mama! I couldn't sleep all last night. They say her brother-in-law wanted her, but she refused, so he framed her. They didn't even consult her family. She brought it on herself. Those are our clan rules. What are you thinking about? Go see if anything's missing. Who's run away? Huagou? Run away? He's run away. Have you got a stomachache? Leave me alone! Don't tell Mom, and I'll be nice to you. Time to eat. Don't upset your mother-in-law. Her husband's not coming back, and he wants money from her. They say he's got another woman. Turn in early. You're going to town, to pray to our ancestors tomorrow. You can see a show while you're there. It'd be better if Huagou was here. Hurry up. Can you sing songs? It's Uncle Huagou singing. It's not him. Let's go. The headman's here. Oh, you're here, too. Did you hear about the adulteress? Yes, she was drowned. - Where's the temple? - Over there. Bless me, and help me get rid of it. I saw Qiaoxiu. She's so sallow and thin. An orphan child. How will she manage? Come here. Let me look at you. I'm going to feed the pigs. I'm going. And I'm not coming back. Sister! Sister! Go look for her round the mountain. Damn her! The bitch has ruined us! I'm really mad! What should I do? We've wasted out time on a whore! Please go away. Don't look. Please go. How shameless! Lust is the worst sin of all. She should be drowned. She's young and ignorant. Please spare her. Please give her a way out. It's that Huagou's fault! He seduced her. She's inherently bad. She's disgraced us. She deserves to die. She can't be killed. We're talking about two lives. A pregnant woman's ghost will make trouble for us. What can we do? - Is that true? - Of course. Chunguan? Come here. I'm going to die. Still mad at me? I can't go on. Don't cry. I'm not mad. Here. I won't tell Mom. Drowning her will cause us problems. Have mercy, please! Show a little kindness. You can't keep her anymore, so please sell her far away, or you'll get mad whenever you see her. There. This way you can get Chunguan another wife. Wash your face and comb your hair. Come inside. Have something to drink. She's here. This is her. Forget it. Goodbye. She's still young. She's not 17 yet. She's about to give birth. Who can I sell a baby to? Have pity on her. I don't want her. Listen to me. You're not to play with her. They've caught a ground squirrel. Chunguan! Chunguan! Let's go look! Be good and go by yourself. - No. - Do what I say. Get out of here, both of you. Let's go, sister. Almost there. Women are born to suffer. I had six children, but they're all dead. God decides our fate. Shout. It may make you feel better. Now it'll be even harder to sell her. Chunguan won't be parted from her. What about the baby? If it's a girl, drown it. It's born, it's born! It's a plump little boy! It's a boy! Bring him down. Come and have a look. He's so chubby and handsome. He's like a little bull. Let's call him Bull. Boil two eggs for Xiaoxiao. Add some brown sugar. Chunguan! - You're going home, too? - We're getting a boat. - You live on the other bank, too? - 10 miles up the mountains. I hear you've got a wife 10 years oder than you, right? Nonsense. He's blushing, it must be true. Nonsense! - Where to? - Yang Clan Village. - Which family? - Chunguan's. It's 10 miles up the mountains. - Finished? - Almost. Find Bull. You're four generations under one roof. Have you seen little Bull? - Have you seen Bull? - No. The bride's coming. Come inside. I won't, I won't! All men get married. Your uncle wasn't weaned when he married. When he sees you're getting married, he'll be so happy. Go meet the bride. You go. You have to go, it's the rules. Now you'll be a mother-in-law. Dad says it's time you slept with Chunguan. It's really double happiness today.
