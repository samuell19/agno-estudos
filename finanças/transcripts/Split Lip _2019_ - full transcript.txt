Sit down. You and I are here right now for two reasons. One, somebody really fucked up and two, you wanna make sure that everyone knows that they did. Let's get one thing straight before we begin. My people are not assassins. This job isn't done from a mile away out of a third story window by some soft-bodied shooter wearing camouflage. We understand that this is personal. What we have to offer is more valuable than a bullet. What we have to offer is a message. He's stolen from you. He blackmailed you. He embarrassed you. And by the morning, everyone will know. My people are not quiet. My people are not clean. Look at me. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. My people are bad people and they love what they do. And most importantly, my people do not make mistakes. I know. How much time do I have? To do what? Survive? To see you. What am I gonna do with you, Set? 20 minutes, on the roof. And Set, don't forget to tip the doorman. You know why we're up here? We're up here because a shooter, piece of shit, is only paying attention to my window. Where as I am only watching him. All right, boss man. Where is your little stray? No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Relax. Hey, relax, you guys called me. You called me. All right, fuck this. She do that to your lip? I hope you realize how serious it is when they bring shooters in. If my bosses are hiring shooters, it means one of two things. One, they want the retribution to be swift. Or two, they don't want you putting anymore of our friends out of commission. I assume you met the doorman. Shit. I stalled. Didn't even tell them where you were yet. Well, when he doesn't check in, they'll call me to handle it. I don't miss calls. When that phone rings, the order goes out statewide. You do know what you did wrong, right? Yeah, I suppose you do. Look, Set, you need to go now. Where? Some place secluded. Away from the bulk of our freelancers. Spread out your hits a bit. East coast? Chicago? No. Arizona. Arizona? Big, open, not as crowded. Lots of desert. I'm supposed to hide there? You need to be able to see around you in all directions at all times. You're not hiding, Set. You're surviving. It's a six hour drive into the desert. My advice, make it a twelve hour one. Pace your trip, keep them guessing. Good luck, Set. We're coming for you. I'm in the ring, I'm in the ring. I'm doing my thing, one-two, one-two. Know what I'm saying, he had a nice jab on him. He don't have a lot of power behind him but it's a pretty cool jab, you know what I'm saying? Slip it. Upper cut to the body, hook to the head. Boom, down. Know what I'm saying? It was good, right? Al. Al. Hey, what're you doing? What the fuck? You sitting around here waiting for something to happen, I didn't want you to be bored. Quit screwing around. What is wrong with you, huh? We won the fight, we're getting paid. Finally. Yeah. Uh huh. Well did the bet go through? It did. Great. So can we expect the money. Yeah, I'm gonna check, I'm going home. Come on, kid, let's go. Forget the fries! You've had half of it already. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on. Hi, my name's Rose. I could really use a ride. That's not an option, I've got water. Oh, thank you. I got it. Oh my God, are you okay? No, I'm fine. Let me help. I'm okay, I'm okay. Your face, let me help you. I said I'm fine. You poor thing. I've been there, I've been there a dozen times. Are you coming out here to leave him? Good for you. I understand that this is a time to be alone. I'm actually running from someone myself. It's okay. Thanks again for the water. Good luck, girly. Hope to see you again. I'll remember you. Never forget a face. I'll remember you. Never forget a face. Get up! Good girl! Did Handsome check in this morning? Handsome checked out this morning. An hour earlier, he reported a civilian casualty. She was nowhere to be found. She buried his victim. In any case, sir, Handsome was the heaviest hitter we had out that far. I don't wanna waste time here. I already did enough of that by giving her the head's up. Who's our top freelancer? Local to that region? Did I say local? No, sir. Internationally, it's Ghetty, by a huge margin. But he poses a risk... How soon can we get him? He's on a job in England, so it'd take a couple of days. Okay. Offer him his full. Then put out a pin. Let's go open season for half of what we'd pay Ghetty. We should still have a few solid freelancers out there. Maybe one of them can save us some money. Arizona is more of a gunman's market. You want shooters too? No shooters. She deserves better than that. You wanna post up at the hospital? Someone to guard the girl's room? No. Set doesn't know yet. Even if she did, she's 400 miles away with no friends. She'd never make it back in time. Hi. Sam, can you check the stove? How was class? You're supposed to turn the knob on low, not off, silly. Let it simmer. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to boil water and then go take a shower. Loads of people do that. Plus, I had to get the work smell off me. What're you looking at? Bruise patterns. What? The patterns in which bruises are formed. Okay, you are such a smart ass, it's not cute. Just see for yourself. God, Samuel, why can't you just look at porn, like normal people? I'm trying to help someone. With what? Homework? I saw someone that looks just like this. I just wanted to know what causes bruises and hers look like this. Wait, you met a girl who looked like that? Yeah. Well, actually, no. I mean, I didn't meet her. I didn't physically shake her hand. Maybe you should just let this one go. Not if maybe I can help her. Come on, Dana, if you saw her face you would get it. No, I get it, Samuel, I do, really. But you're not a fighter. Call the police, drop a tip. For all you know, she's knee deep in a divorce and the guy responsible is behind bars. Do something, set the table. Hey! Hey! Hey! You should know that hitting girls is wrong or hitting anybody is wrong. I don't now if you're her boyfriend or her husband or whatever you are but you should go, all right? I'll call the cops. In fact, I've actually already called the cops. So you should just leave. Relax, friend. I'm not anybody's boyfriend. I don't know what you're talking about but you sound pretty serious. So how about I give you a hand? Would you mind lowering the flashlight, please? My eyes, they're sensitive to the light. Sorry, man. Oh, it's fine. Hey, where were you? Oh my God, what happened? Samuel, talk to me, what happened? Are you hurt? It's not mine. Oh my God, let's go to the kitchen. Oh, shit. How did you find me? You know, you're a lot smaller in person. Like a little rat. Pretty though, if you like that tenderized look. Okay. I take it back. You're not pretty anymore. I guessed. The pin didn't say you was a freelancer, I guessed. It was the pictures. Yeah, you definitely killed before. It's in the eyes. Fuck you, fist jockey! Always looking down your damn noses at us like we're scum. We're all killers, bitch. We just have the sense to do it in the 21st century. You freelancers are animals. And the way you catch an animal is you hire a hunter. Your people would've floundered around for days looking for you. All I had to do was think like one of you. Like a scared little fucking rat! Fuck you! Kill me now or let me go, you're dead in 24 hours anyway. I didn't pick up your pin, I hacked in, you little slut! But someone else did. Yeah. You caught the attention of a real big fucking animal. You take my word for it, honey. You got no idea what's coming for you. No idea. If you had half a brain, you'd let me go! Because what I do to you with my gun is gonna be like a mercy compared to what he's gonna do! You come back here and look at me in my face, you fucking animal! This is crazy. Yeah. Should I call the cops? No. I mean, if you would've stayed in your car, yes, but you didn't. Went and got mixed up in everything. Last thing I want is for you to be around these kind of people. No. I think you should just stay away from her. But what if she needs my help? No. She was just protecting herself. You don't know that. Yes I do. She didn't even show up until he tried to shoot me. Sam, stop! You have no idea what she would've done if you would've stayed. I can't tell you how glad I am that you were helping someone, really I am. And I am so happy that you're okay. So then just let me... But listen! There's something you need to understand about people like her. They don't live in the same world as you and I. We live our life trying to be good, trying to help people, not hurt them. But lives like hers, they're toxic. They end up in tragedy. You can't kill someone and be normal after. I don't know what that girl has been through but, honestly, any humanity she had is gone. I'm sorry. Come on, we should be celebrating! We should be leaving. No. Not until the transfer's completed and confirmed. Well I'm celebrating anyway. Hey, slow down. Did you see the look on the referee's face when I didn't slow down? That's how you know, they pay them too. See, they don't trust the fighters to stay down anymore, so they cut the refs in. Added insurance. Imagine his face. Think he still gets paid? Judging by these numbers, it looks like we're the only ones getting paid tonight. Go-Rilla! Go-Rilla! Here it is, folks, Rilla was down, but hears the crowd chanting his name and he gets back up and he's fighting hard. And would you look at the face on that stupid, fucking referee! Hey! I hope you realize how fucking serious this is! By tomorrow morning, we're gonna have some very influential people looking for our heads! So put down the drink, get your clothes or whatever you need. I got the car running outside. I want you out there in five minutes, you understand? Okay. Okay. Wait for my word. I'm going to assume that that wasn't good news. Good and bad. A shooter located Set last night from inside my network. Shooter confirmed dead, presumably at her hands. Authorities located his car but apparently there was a noose I could give a shit about his car. I hope that's not the good news. No, sir. We have a local freelancer, serious heavyweight, interested. He sent me a bid this morning. What kind of asshole bids back at us? You remember Alexander Marks? The cowboy? What's he asking? Two points over what we're offering. Oh, you bloodsucker. Slight problem, though. Oh, you mean other than the price? When I said serious heavyweight, I meant it. He's got a lot of influence in that market. Word got out that Marks was bidding on her. Now nobody's touching it until he's had his go. Unless you want to wait for one of our Mexico agents, Marks has the bid. There was never any room for this Mickey Mouse bullshit when I was taking contracts. Wild West, sir. Okay. Enough of this tiptoeing around shit, here's the deal. You accept his offer. You tell him that he's got till 12:30 to complete the kill. And if we don't hear back from him by 12:31, I'm talking about a phone call, we're sending in all kinds of fuck-off shooters to kill everything, him included! It's not what you think! Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! I can explain! I can explain! Ow, I hurt my head. Oh, God, calm down! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Who are you? I'm Samuel. I'm just Samuel. You're not a shooter, you're not a freelancer, what are you? I'm none of those things! I'm not any of that! Why are you following me? I wanna help. I just wanna help! You saved my life last night. You were incredible. Oh, you looked a lot taller on top of that car though. No, I'm really sorry. I just wanted to say thank you and just see that you were okay. My name's Samuel, what's your name? You need to go. But I just got here and I wanna help. They know I'm here. Then why don't you go? In here, I'm the only person they can hurt. But we're a team now. You may as well open the door, Set. I'm not gonna kick it down. Fine. I'll talk to your door. My name is Marks. You know me by ranking. My bid was accepted this morning. If I didn't hold you in high regard as a freelancer, you'd already be dead. You're one of us, so I'm extending you a professional courtesy. I expect the same. I'm leaving you an address. You better be there by noon tomorrow. Set, you know how bad this gets if I have to come find you. I got really nervous. But you're safe now. I mean, until noon tomorrow because professional courtesy. It's like a duel, right? You get to fight him? Great! I don't mean "great." I mean, that guys sounds terrifying and probably like three times your size but I mean great for me because maybe you wanna grab food and/or coffee with me? I mean, if you're free. Which, I know you're free. Wait, is that not cool? I just figured, you know, on your day off you might wanna enjoy it a little bit and, you know, it might be your last. You don't think that helicopter's for you, is it? My sister says you don't have a soul. I mean, not that you don't have a soul and not that she's right but, you know, she's just being a sister. You don't have to hide like that, you know. I mean, I know you know a lot of bad people but people here are mostly pretty nice. They'd wanna help you more than hurt you. That's what I'm trying to avoid. Why are you so afraid of help? Because I don't deserve it. How many people have you killed? 17. They were all coming after you, right? No. You hungry? I know this really great spot. Well, it's kind of a spot but it's definitely really good. Come on, you're hungry. It's a yes! Come on. You like Mexican? Don't worry, they washed their hands. If they don't, it just adds to the flavor. See? Mmmm. God, that's good. You know, I saw you at the library. I have a hard time focusing some times, so I like to read different pieces of different books at different times and find a reason in my head to make it all apart of the same story. I think that's how things are sometimes, you know? Like, we're each our own different type of book but we're all part of the same story. But only sometimes. You like it? Oh my God! I almost forgot what today is! Oh, it's already started but we can still make it. I have an extra mask in my car but it's usually for Dana but she never likes to go, so now it's yours. Come on, come on, come on! Come on! Come on. Don't worry, it's just a local thing. Not a lot of people come to these. Not a lot of people know about it. Someone started it one day and sometimes people bring friends and no one ever takes their masks off. It's okay. Don't be afraid, you're safe here. There you go. Did you know it was me? Come on! Come on, it's okay. Come on. What's wrong? I smiled. Thanks for everything. That's not very sportsman like. Whatever. Those toothpicks are gonna break before my hands do. You wanna know how much you were worth? Not enough. Okay. It's okay. Just let it go. It's over. Hey! Who the fuck are you? Hey, you okay? Are you okay? Go get his phone. Where? I got it! I got it! What now? Dial the last number on his phone or they'll be here. Okay. Set? It's done. She's dead. Congrats, cowboy. The transfer's on the way. I'm gonna get you out of here. Dana! Samuel, what the hell? Help me with her. What happened? She had to fight. What did you do? Don't worry, I'm fine, okay? Just get me some more pillows. We'll just call the cops. We'll tell them you find her in the street. She was mugged. No, no way! The people that did this to her think she's dead. I called them and if they find out she's alive then they'll just come after her. Sam, stop! You can't just harbor a criminal in our home. Especially if she's bleeding all over the couch. I'll get the pillows. What're you gonna do if she dies? She's not gonna die. Look at her! No! She's not gonna die. Hey. It's been a whole day. Drink. They think you're dead. Thank you. So it's done then? Are you asleep again? No. Oh. So that guy was really trying to kill you. Why? I made a mistake. So they're after you because the girl's dead. They're after me because she's still alive. And as long as we both are, they're just gonna keep coming. I can't. Okay. Is there a problem with the transfer? Hello. Do you know whose phone you have, young lady? She's not dead. The girl you're looking for, she's alive. Who is this? I want you to get her out of my house. Get her out. But promise you'll leave us out of this. Agreed. I think it's best for all of us. You have my word as a professional. I'll tell you where she is. Why don't you tell me everything? From the beginning. Hey. Are you feeling better now? Oh, I got your car towed over. It's in the parking lot and I bought food. I'm not an awesome cook but one time I got to help Dana. I have to go. Wait, what? Is something wrong? Did they find you? I've already been here too long. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. If you go out there, they'll find you. Just wait it out a couple more days. I'm running out of time. Running out of time for what? Hey. Hey, just wait a second, please! What do you think this is? Who do you think I am? Why don't you get it? I kill people. Not bad people. Just people. You're different from everybody. No I'm not. You know what I regret the most? I regret not killing that little girl because if she was dead, my life would still be the same and I'd still be doing the only thing I'm good for. No. No, you're not a bad person. You're not like them. Yes I am. Are you listening to me? The world is full of terrible people who don't care about you, your sister or your ignorant little lives and I'm one of them. I am a monster. I have to go. Hey. Where is she? Sam, where is she? She left. She's gone. She's gone? What do you mean she's gone, for good? Oh shit. Oh shit. I thought you'd be happy. Samuel, I think I made a mistake. Oh my God. Are you okay? I messed up. I told them she was at our house. I told them where our house is! You called them? Why would you do that? I don't know, I don't know, I don't know! Because she's a killer! Because we can't keep her around like a fucking pet! Oh my God. If they come and she's gone. I have to find her. No, you can't go. They're coming. No, it's not right! She made mistakes but I have to try and at least warn her. But you can't go, Sam! You sold her out. I didn't. Yes you did. No, I didn't. Sam, I didn't. Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck! Are you kidding me?! God! Oh my God. It's okay. It's fine. It's fine. Samuel. I'm just gonna call and it'll fix it. It'll fix it. She's not here. I'm the one who called before. The girl, she's gone. She left. Say something, please! This number won't work anymore. No, no, no, please! I messed up, I did, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, no. Oh my God, I don't know what I did. This doesn't mean a whole lot to me. What you and I are doing here, it doesn't. I could stop your heart in two hits. This isn't about stopping your heart, Samuel. It's about starting hers. Everyone seems to have underestimated her. I want to inspire her. She's a hero on a journey and every hero needs a dragon. I want her to come find me. She's not like you. Oh, we'll see, Samuel. Dana. When is Ghetty getting here? Should be here within the hour. He shoulda been here yesterday when I ordered him. Do we know what he was doing in Phoenix? I received a correspondence from him earlier. Essentially, it was his ETA and a warning to keep our phone close. His words were poetic. Fucking artists. Get away from him. Get out of my house. Now. Now. I'm sorry. Set? Hey, girl. Do you remember the first job I gave you? Hired you to kill that guy that was selling you all that shit. Goddamn, you were thin. A little stick. I asked you, "Are you ready? "You sure you're ready?" Do you remember you answer? "I'm set," you said. "I'm all set." You know, this ends much easier if you come see me now. Regardless of what happens, no matter how this turns up, I don't regret one single bit of it. I'm proud of you, girl. I'm gonna fix this. She's going to the hospital. How do you know? Because, she's trying to eliminate witnesses. There's no telling what happened to the civilians in Arizona when Ghetty was down there. But if they're gone, then that girl in ICU is her last piece to clean up. Sir, are we letting her? No. We have to set precedent. Call Ghetty. Clear out the entire hospital wing. Bring shooters. Bloodbath or not, I can't take chances on this. She doesn't leave, no matter what happens. For her and that girl, it's over tonight. Welcome home, Set-y. She didn't mean to. What's up, bitches? Lunch is here. This is a hospital. Get out the chair. Let's see what the doctor ordered today. Babysitters. Really? Little much, huh? No rookies, please. I need some privacy. Oh no, I'll wait. Samuel was very brave. Truth is, Set, we all make mistakes before we hit that first hundred mark. You can come back from this. I am your muse. Now show me something you've never done to survive. I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry. I did this. You did this to me. I did that to you. I don't remember my mom. I can't remember her face at all. I don't, I don't have memories of my family. Never even had a first kiss. Everything that I've learned, every person that I've killed, I've never lost control and then you, and then you, and I'm sorry for that. I took everything from you. I took your mom. I took your dad. I took your smile. I'm a monster and I'm sorry. I've spent every hour of the last four days fighting for my life with everything that I have because I couldn't let them take it. I couldn't let them take it. My life is the only thing that I have to offer you. You're the only person that has the right to make this decision. And everything you're feeling right now, it's okay. All the anger, it's okay. It's okay. It's your decision to make alone. No, focus on me. Focus. This decision is the only thing that matters right now. It's the only thing. It's your decision.
