Station Cologne one, uncontained fire. Checking the overhead bins. Okay, Sarah, now we have O2 diminishing. CO2 ten, HCI six, HCN six, O2 high. Copy that. Sarah, check the APM right behind you and switch it off. - Closing the O2 valves. - Okay. Fire source located. I found which CB tripped. Great, Sarah. Perfect. Right on time. Sending CSACP readings. - Give it to me. - Thanks. - How does it feel now? - That's it. - That's it? - That's great. Yeah, yeah. - That's... - Perfect. Now we'll update the procedure for this task. I switched to forehand control. I can feel the joint limit better. And all degrees of freedom are fine for you? It's good? Perfect. - Okay? - Yeah. Turn around. Lift your hip, please. Okay, thanks. Twenty meters. Thirty. - Ai. - Uh-uh. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, and ignition and lift-off. Lift-off of the Soyuz for the International Space Station. Aye-aye, captain. Laika. Laika. - Hello. - Hello. Why don't we just take Curiosity to get there? We need to find a path. Common, we need to go there. - Find a way to go. - As you said, we thought maybe we can go around. - Sedimentary rocks... - Yeah, you're right. That's exactly why we're going to Mars, you know. Let's go around and take our time to climb Mount Sharp with the surface units. There's no rush. Thomas? - Are you with me? We broke... - Yeah, I'm sorry. No, like he said, going around this is not an option? - No, no, no, forget I went. - Go on, go on. - Okay, let's keep going. - Yeah, yeah. So, I suggest that our short... Um, give me, give me two minutes, I'll be back. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I think so. I think so. It must be hard, it must be definitely hard. They'd rather ask you to go, I guess. Hi, do you want to say a few words for the other team? Sure. Now? Yeah, now is fine. Okay, hey. All right, well, I never thought that one day I'd be saying the last mission before Mars, and yet, here we are making last preparations for the long journey. I'm very excited to be sharing this mission with Anton Ocheivsky. A very experienced cosmonaut. Unfortunately, Mark isn't going to be able to make this journey and, uh, we have with us, a kind of last-minute, uh, crew member. Uh, she is... Well, she's an excellent engineer and she is French. Which I believe is really gonna be a very cool thing when we're up there in the ISS because apparently, French women are really good when it comes to cooking. - I don't know. Is that true? - Oh, come on, Mike. Sarah, why don't you come up and say a few words? S'il vous plait. S'il vous plait. Um... I, I just wanted to say that I'm... I'm very proud to be a part of this very special mission. Thank you guys for putting up with me throughout our training. I'll miss you. I remember when I was eight, I took a lamp shade from the living room, put it on my head, I was ready to go to space, and in that moment I knew I wanted to be an astronaut. But my mother said it was not a job for girls. Thank you. - Who wants a hot dog? - Me, me! Sarah. Ah, Sarah, you like yours rare, medium, well-done? I'm guessing because you're French, you like it rare, however, in this case I don't recommend it. You like, uh, you like mustard or ketchup? - Mustard. - Hi. Naomi, this is Sarah. - Sarah, this is my wife. - Sarah. - Naomi. - Nice to meet you. Congratulations, you must be so happy. Thanks. I will leave you two alone. Thanks. You have a daughter, right? Yes. Stella. So, who is she going to be staying with? Her father. Oh, great. We're separated but it'll be fine. Ah. Well, I'm gonna be taking care of the kids too. We have two little guys, and they're really proud of their daddy, boy. To prevent this from happening the Soyuz performs an additional cycle. This changes its orbital plane slightly and makes a collision between the two vehicles impossible. Despite these precise maneuvers, what if the thrusters fail to slow down the Soyuz, and the vehicle travels too fast as it approaches the ISS? This could end in disaster, with the Soyuz crashing into the station instead of docking. A permanent base is the next logical step following the co-operation of countries from all over the world for the International Space Station. One key thought is to use the moon's own natural resources to build and sustain a base. Its water, metals and minerals. Using its own materials to 3D print a structure or building on it. A Rover can land on the surface, inflate a dome, and other Rovers can begin to construct a building to protect the astronauts. Planet Earth is protected by the atmosphere, the layer of air and gas that surrounds it. The atmosphere shields the Earth from solar radiation... ...because the moon has no atmosphere there's no protection from solar radiation. Okay. Okay. Laika. Laika. Hello! Okay. Laika. Ah. Laika. Okay. Okay. Oui. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. Wait. Yes, you can. Thank you. Oh. - Hello, Sarah. - Hi, Kirshime. Sarah. Maybe, let's go see Mike. - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. Come on. He must be working. It's all he ever does. That's Mike. - Hi, Jurgen. - Hi. - You remember him. - Yeah, sure. Oh, I'm sorry, I won't hug you. I'm dripping with sweat from the gym. So, you... You're training in Star City. Yeah. If anything happens to you, I'll be the one to go up there. Awesome. I... I guess I'll see you around. Yeah. - See you. - See you. - Bye. - Bye. Come on. Hey, Mike. Look who's here. Hi. Hi. How was your trip? - Great. - All right. It's cold here, but you get used to it. Sit down. Okay, I'll get a glass. The three of us need to drink to our mission, okay? One minute. So, are you ready for tomorrow? Yeah, sure. I looked at your schedule. I think you ought to ask them to lighten your load. - Lighten it? - Why lighten it? I'm just saying, for your sake, and I'm also thinking about Jurgen. What do you mean? Well, maybe you don't have to do absolutely everything. Why not? I'm just saying it might be in your best interest and in the best interest of all of us if you, uh, ask for a lighter prep schedule. It's not a reflection on your, uh, core skills. Okay, Mike, can we move on? Sorry, but, um, what do you know about my core skills? Lighter prep is not an insult. It's not like I'm calling you a space tourist. Well, you didn't have to, you were thinking it so loud. That's not what I meant. Sure. Maybe just drink, hmm? - Okay. - Forget it. Mike. Yeah. Oh, well, we'll see. You know. Maybe the... Maybe the space tourist thing was a little... Right? If the idea of sitting on, uh, several million pounds of explosives uh, is frightening to you, then maybe you're in the wrong profession. An astronaut is not going to function very well if he's thinking about his, uh, personal safety. I'm very proud to be a part of this long history of space exploration. We've been to the moon, uh, we're going to Mars. There's no limit if we put our minds to it. I'm very excited about, uh, where we're going. You know, I can't say that I've ever been afraid. The reason that we're not afraid is our training. Ready. Ready. You did an excellent job today. Thanks. You've a boyfriend? No. Girlfriend? Are you taking a survey? Trying to be a good crew member. Trying to figure out what makes you tick. Oh, yeah? See you tomorrow. Hmm? - Sarah, you okay? - Yeah. - Mike, what's going on? - My ankle. What? I twisted it. Da. Fuck. Da. Okay. - You okay? - Mmm. I'm worried about my mother. She's sick. I hope she's not going to die before my return. How's your mother handling it? She must be really proud. She's dead. I'm sorry. You couldn't know. Okay, it's poetry time, yeah? Now... it's you're turn, Mike. - Moi? - Oui, monsieur. All right. "Give me the splendid silent sun "with all his beams full-dazzling; "Give me nights perfectly quiet, "as on high plateaus west of the Mississippi, "and I looking up at the stars; "Give me odorous at sunrise "a garden of beautiful flowers, "where I can walk undisturbed." Allo? Allo? Hey, Stella. Remember me? Hi, young lady. Hey. You look like your mother, you know? Okay. Sarah! - I'm coming! - Hurry up. So, after, you jump, don't forget, you cannot adjust the collar manually on a space suit to prevent water from entering. Yeah, and you should really disconnect the ventilation tube that goes around your neck on the left side. If you blow into it manually, you can inflate the space suit. That's going to give you some extra flotation, and a nice layer of insulation. Because today, the water was warm... Yeah. ...but if you ditch into the Pacific, it's going to be a different story. Right. Well, we're not looking to... to ditch into the Pacific, right? No. Sure, no. As a prime scenario. But, you know, it could go really wrong sometimes. What is our life expectancy in cold waters? Well, depending on the water, it could be down to just a couple of hours. And only if you inflate your suit, that could double it, so it's kind of a big deal. Is there any data... ...on the effectiveness of the ventilation tube in this scenario? Is there any evidence that those tubes were effective in inflating... So, right after you ditch, the capsule's going to move about quite a bit. You have to jettison the parachute, and there's a lot of actions in the procedure to close all the valves and make the situation survivable. - Okay. - After that, it's all about grabbing your kit and egressing. Each one of you is responsible for a specific part of the kit, - remember? - Yeah. So, make sure you grab it, and then egress in the appropriate order. Mmm-hmm. - Looks quite easy on paper. But I can tell you, after six months of not feeling your weight, it's going to be a struggle to get out of the capsule. Stella? Yes, on the use of the survival kit, when I saw you use the signaling mirror, that's actually really good because if your line... Stella? Stella! Stella! Stella? Sarah. Where was she? In the park. She's quite adventurous, like her mother. Thanks. - Sarah, are you okay? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, guys. - All good. Little wait. - Your daughter's okay? - Yeah. I'm really sorry. You know, this is no place for a kid, here. You're going to have to cut the cord. You're going to be gone in a month, anyway. Okay. Okay, I get it, Mike. But I was taking care of everything... What were you thinking? ...so I really don't need parenting lessons from you. - Oh, are you sure about that? - Fuck you. Fuck me? No, fuck you! - Mike. - Okay. Stop, right now. Are you crying? Or do you have a cold? Okay. If you want, but you are the one who called me. Do you know this Italian saying... "You wanted a bike... so ride it now." Don't worry. Everything's going to be all right. Okay. It's not gonna to be very pleasant. But, when you're ready you can start... Sarah? What happened? Hey... hey. You okay? Okay? All right. Let me handle it. Uh, it's okay. It's okay. She's... Stella, come here. Mama has something... - Hello? - Mmm. Yeah. - Oh, hey. - Hi. I'm going to the store. Do you want anything? You want company? I'll come with. I was on the phone with my boys this afternoon... - Cool. - ...and they said it's so hot in Houston they were actually swimming in the pool. - Really? - That's crazy. Swimming in the pool, this time of the year. Yep. How can you deny climate change? She already has this one. It's always the same stuff. How about one of these guys, here? It's not that big. You can FedEx it. Yeah, it's cute. Oh, there she is. Right there. Hey, take a look at this. When you were a little girl growing up in France, singing "Frere Jacques", did you ever imagine that you'd... find yourself... immortalized in one of these? - Well... - Let's get that. - Excuse me, ma'am. - Stop. Should she have to pay for these fridge magnets? Yes, of course. Which one of these is selling better, ma'am? This one or this one? Both of them? Which one's selling better, in your opinion? Yeah. 17 days... we're gonna to be up there. Yeah. You know... we're not robots. When I... got back from Afghanistan and... applied for the... astronaut program, I was a wreck. I nearly got disqualified. - Really? - Yeah. You know, there's no such thing... as a perfect astronaut. Just like there's no such thing as a perfect mother. Enjoy gravity. Who wants some cake? All right. Ralph, you don't want any cake, do you? No, you don't get it. Yeah, all right, here you go. - Hello? Uh-huh. Yeah. - Hey. It's good-luck cake. Thanks. Anton. Mike, over here, please, a little bit. Sarah. Mike! Mike! Mike! - Be a good kid, okay? - Now, let's hear it for our astronauts, as they begin quarantine. The lead crew, Anton Ocheivsky, Russia. Mike Shannon, USA. Sarah Loreau of France. And the backup crew, Jurgen Nielsen, Denmark. Sean Paul, USA. I had 'em give you an upgrade. - Sarah. - You're in the Coco Chanel suite. - Bye. - See you later. Zero-nine-twenty-five is on two, I have the target on, the three is up for the callouts. It's LEE internal... Hey. Hmm. My right, which 0.8... Sarah... But of course, send them in. Okay. Ooh! She's playing wicked. To make it in this space program, thank God, doesn't require ping-pong skills. - I hope. - Cool. ...stable. Everything is looking good for tomorrow's launch. Things are about to light up very much so here on the steps of Baikonur in Kazakhstan. Only about a mile away at 9:00 p.m., we'll be watching the launch of the Soyuz TMA 056, on its way to join the International Space Station. It will carry a multinational crew with French astronaut Sarah Loreau, US astronaut Mike Shannon, and Russian cosmonaut Anton Ocheivsky. Okay. Sarah! T minus 3 minutes.
