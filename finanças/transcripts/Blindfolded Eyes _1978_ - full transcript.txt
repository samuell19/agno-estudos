THE BLINDFOLDED EYES To my son Antonio All of us present are making a call To save those who still live in prisons around the world To save all those who are tortured in hand of their executioners We don't want to hear tomorrow that we neglected the existence of these crimes We want to prevent these scenes from repeating Those scenes that shocked the world after the Second World War When millions of innocent people, true living corpses... Left the concentration camps with weak steps Faced with this horrible reality... Many said they never knew the existence of these extermination camps This comission has proof that today freedom is stolen And that people are assassinated with complete impunity In countries that presume to be civilized This comission has proof that condemns the governmental systems That tolerate and even protect this systems of repression This comission has the duty to warn That there's an increase of terror and violence in the world And that the process could get worse in a near future But the declarations of the witnesses will speak better than my words What they have to say has been verified as true by this comission The declarations work on our favor Let's call Ines Well it was around 3am... When they rang my doorbell insistently So I looked thru the balcony and saw 4 or 5 guys Dressed as civilians, with pistols and machine guns And they told me to open the door, so I told my parents I was going out I went down, opened the door, and they pushed me... They asked who lived there, I told them my parents and me And they came in, I'll always remember... It was July 9, two days before my birthday... So they came in my house and pointed me with a gun They told me not to scream, they asked my name. I told them. My parents were horrified. They told them not to get involved, that it wasn't about them I was worried for my mom who has a heart disease... Luis... come - I'm gonna scold you. - Why? I've told you to call me when you're coming, I don't want you to wait out there - How are you? - Fine, peaceful - Sit down there. - Yes. - I'm drinking cognac, want some? - No, later. How are you? How do I look? Very good But, don't you notice something... No Well, you're a little fatter... Well, come close Look at my face What is it? The eyes... I've operated The wrinkles Yes Its fine, its very fine - You're very beautiful... - But you didn't notice... - Notice... - Well... Now let's be practical It's been a long time since I wanted to tell you something But since we never see each other And I don't want you to say no But how can I say no if I don't know what you're asking Do you think I could be an actress? Do you really mean it? Yes, I really mean it I've thought about it a lot I don't care if it's only a small role, but I want to be an actress You can never be sure, but... - But if you want, come by my studio... - Well, look who's here. - Hello, Manuel. - Hello, Luis, you finally came. - Last time we called you at your studio, but you didn't answer. - It's true. - I was downstairs. - It was about Emilia's classes, did she tell you? Yes, she just told me. Well, if she likes it, great! - Well, if it amuses her. - It doesn't amuse me, it is my vocation. But recognize it is a late vocation - You see how bad he is. - But he right... Don't be angry. Come, to work. The torture. Good-bye - So I'll pass by your studio. - Yes, really, whenever. How do I look? Fine, fine. Sorry - So, how are things latey. - Fine. I lead a very peaceful life, I give classes... Nothing in particular Well, about theater... I don't know. I would assist more, if there was any good theater, of course... Does it hurt? - Open. - Sorry. And here, does it hurt? Your mouth is a mess. Why haven't you taken care... - But it can be fixed? - Sure, everything can be fixed, except death. - We're still in time, but you should take it seriously. - Ok. We're not used to go to the dentist, and that's a mistake. Yes... What I don't understand is why haven't you invented another instrument of torture What an exaggeration You'll see, it's nothing Mouth wide open Easy, easy... Help! You're a son of a bitch It's over You should find a small river where to fish peacefully... It's ready Wash your mouth Thanks I couldn't sleep, so I started to think about the most important moments of my life Those moments which have marked you forever I thought about women With the ones I had sex I tried to remember their faces Their bodies And I felt a chill The chill of a disaster And for the first time in my life... I had the terrible sensation... Of having lived in vain Like... Like if I had just slightly touched the surface of things Without realizing Of why and for what I did those things I had just walked half the way It's possible to slide thru life, like that, with impunity? We don't like what you are preparing, leave it before it's too late. That's it. Move your hips. Feel your hips. Let's see how the articulations are working. The connections. We shall imagine that the hips are an empty box Joint to the mouth by an elastic tube. It's a humid box, resonant. Try slowly, very slowly, to produce sounds... Very soft vibrations, slow. More timid. Sounds that resonate in our body, that run thru the tube to the mouth If you already did it, just go over it again and again And slowly try to interact with an imaginary antagonist, slowly... Let's see if the sounds can mix... Into an incomprehensible dialogue that comes from your hips That's it... slow... slowly. Slowly... Let's talk to the antagonist in our body That's it, right That's it, slow, slow That's it, slowly Now imagine there's someone sleeping beside you so you can't talk at that volume Continue... yes, that's it What do you think? - I didn't expect this. - Why? - It's a bit crazy. - Yes... - But I like it. - You like it? - Yes. - Do you dare? - Not now, I've come... Take off your shoes My god, what do I do? Just let go. Let your body participate. Go. And now imagine there's no limits, and you can abandon your body... Go on... And slowly form a circle, keep talking... And when I clap, stop and relax And now reflexes, come Laura, follow your reflexes Come, Emilia, relax And now, slowly, let's walk, feel the weight... Let's search for a space, let's feel the body's weight Now find a fixed space Let the weight lead you, feel your head fall And feel your back bend, every vertebra, let it go Let's feel the body's weight, let's not precipitate Our knees bend, we feel tired And we let our bodies relax completely We separate a little, we don't touch anyone Nobody should interfere in our concentration Eyes open, relaxed forehead We are here and now... And now we go inside ourselves Let's start looking inside And we see our body as a long tunnel Dark, soft, damp, with shining colors And we look at the heart... We can see the red organ Warm, elastic We feel how it releases warm waves of blood Is it possible? For this fucking pain to come back... And now precisely... Well, let's see if it goes away No, please... What am I doing here? Alone... With a little luck I'll be fine I don't want to be seen like this If I die, I want to die alone, like a dog, fuck Oh, dear mother... what a pain! I think something is wrong I don't know why we are always getting into trouble Is something wrong? It's of no importance - Can we help? - Its a colic It happens to me sometimes - Does it still hurt? - No. I'm still asleep, I feel the warmth, the blankets There's no noise in the street I feel the door of my room open It is my mother coming in I feel her stand I feel her watching me And then she sits in my bed, and it screeches And she caresses my head with her hand, softly I remember her hand, red, with wrinkles, working hands Red, sweet Anyway... This could be an excercise of emotional memory. Naturally, the process should be more detailed. And more pacient I've only walking a path, that I know but haven't visited If you have a question, make it And then we'll try an excercise Should we try to express theatrically? No, I believe we must avoid the theatrical and histrionic What we need is a real contact with our object and memory Is the role of imagination important? The role of imagination is of recreating Because what you remember is partial The more you use your imagination for filling in The more truthful will the acting be. Understood? Any more questions? Ok, then I will now try An excercise to approach some persons Emilia, how about it? Ok Let's see If I say a word... Summer What does it suggest? The sea The beach Heat Heat, but there must be some detail. In people's faces... The contact with your sweaty clothes The contact with the sand Heat I see a white door A path A wheat field The door, tell me more about it Is it old or new? How is it painted? Is wood or steel? I see an old wood door White, very white And I open the door And I see the sea Well... What I am going to say isn't to criticize I didn't want to make an excercise, just an approximation Tomorrow we'll excercise, more relaxed But I will still tell you a few things What you have told us are a some images Very utopic, beautiful perhaps But you haven't told us Of your deep sensations That's what we're interested in for this job This job requires a detailed reconstruction of the past Through the detailed and complete description Of objects, odours, sensations, colors, persons... Understand? That's why a detail that might seem insignificant It is a mine We must search it It's not about making a rational study of one's behavior What a critical study does is repress, limit, and classify The ashes of a burnt fire We don't need to hide anything We need to revive the fire Let it burn again Do you understand? And you And you, and you, and you... Would know more about yourselves If you would burn that fire of the past Is it clear? You haven't done as we said. Suffer the consequences Who is it? - Who is it?! - Emilia What is it? I'm sorry to bother you Come in. What is it? Who hit you? He never acted like this and suddenly... - Calm down. - He hit me He went mad He hit me, look He really hurt me Oh my... It's alright now Come in, don't worry Let's go upstairs cause it's cold here - He was like a beast, I don't know what happened to him. - Calm down He never hit me before - Never since I know him. - It's alright - He never hit me before. - Well... He wanted to kill me It's ok Sit down Thanks... thanks I'll give you a coke - No. - Ok What a beast! I'm not coming back to him. I hate him Beast! - Look Emilia, I don't want to get involved. - I know - Every marriage is a mess. - A big mess! You know that well Do you know what happened? It was so stupid Manuel is jealous of your classes So he tells me I'm never home He says its a waste of time. He laughs of your classes and you And tonight he started to get jealous So I got angry and told him a few words And he began to hit me like crazy And I told him I was coming to live with you But, why did you do that?! It just came out What a mess you made Don't worry, I have an hotel reservation Well, I'm going... - Thanks for your help. - Emilia, no, wait... My suitcases... I already had the reservation... Emilia, it's not that... - Oh my god. - Emilia... I don't have anyone to go to Come in, please, I'm sorry - Come in, please. - I don't want to bother you Come in again and don't worry, I'm sorry... - Am I bothering you. - Of course no. - I'm being ridiculous. - No. - Sit down. - Yes, I mean, no... Well, don't sit I should have taken this decision long time ago I'm a stupid Oh, yes, I am stupid How could I tolerate this imbecile For so long... Plus, thinking it was my fault Do you know why I told myself every day? I told myself: "Emilia... Please, Emilia, be patient, you'll see how everything works out And all this is because I'm irritable! Everything is because I am changing I want to find myself, and that's what bothers him Your classes opened my eyes and that's what he hates Also, because I am trying to find myself That's what bothers him the most I need to talk to someone who understands me I need to give affection It's not only about receiving Yes. Not only to receive, to give... What do you think about my acting You've done great Better than before... Don't answer Relax, we must confront things Hello? Yes, Manuel, she's here Well, that's your problem... She can stay here the time she needs Look, I don't think its the best time for her to talk - Tell him no. - Better tomorrow? Ok, I'll tell her, wait He wants to talk to you, he insists I don't want to, tell him Manuel, she doesn't want to Yes, yes, well... But Manuel, why do you think that, no, no Manuel, would you let me speak? You know what, you're an imbecile! What did he say? What did he say? Tell me That both of us go to hell Very bad... Emilia Spensa - You saw me. - I'm ashamed No, don't be ashamed Shall I stay? Ok All the time I want? All the time you want Luis... We're going to start from zero... Let's tell ourselves everything, ok? Everything? - No dirty corners? - I'm not laughing Really, let's start clean, you and me. Be honest... Alright? Ok But we start tomorrow, ok? Tomorrow... Why don't you put some music? Well, I spent my childhood in Murcia That's where I was born, well, you know that already And where my mother was born I don't know if you want me to tell you... Something from those years... I can only say my childhood was very normal Without up and downs I had a dog I loved, he was very ugly - What was its name? - His name was Trompo And we played in the roof We acted out the war and weird scenes What I mostly remember is the sun The heat of the summer The land dry from lack of water And the light very bright It lighted up everything Strange, but the painter who best resembled that luminosity is Van Gogh I don't know, its so far away So far and with no importance My father died very young. I was a baby. And I don't remember nothing of him if it wasn't for the photos And when father died the family business was lost My mother tried to maintain it for a while but it was a disaster My mother was a very warm woman She was a bit lazy and very pessimistic I inherited from her the fear that the sky could fall any moment Where was I, I got lost... Your mother took the business. The family told her to send me to Madrid with uncle Andr?s To work and become a man And so I came to Madrid And I thought I was going to work on a counter Or keeping the books And my uncle Andr?s who took it very seriously Put me to work immediately as a delivery boy With the disadvantage of my health and my morals - Poor little one! - I can still see myself carrying 20 kg sacks And I was only 14 years old then Do I look good? You're very handsome Good morning, Don Andr?s What do you want? Don't you remember me? You're Luis. Luis L?pez (Tierral) You've got the same memory as always How come your're here, I haven't seen you since... It's been 23 years, Don Andr?s What a barbarity! And what do you want? Nothing, I was just passing by - And I couldn't resist the temptation. - Very good Come in! But just for a moment... And only if I'm not interrupting, because for you work is... On the contrary, this is over What's been of your life? Nothing in particular You've progressed I knew it. I always thought you were quite awake Intelligent This work wasn't for you That's what I told your mother And to *Supriamo*, may he rest in peace Do you say it because of this? Well, I got into some business In the good times, when one could earn money But now things are more difficult Do you remember I liked to write? I had no idea What do you mean? I will never remember the day... when you surprised me writing a poem I was scared thinking I was going to lose my job But you told me to read it to you - Excuse me a minute, I'll be right there. - There's no hurry And so I read the poem, and it said... He who sighs through life Asks himself, what is life? Life is a suffering, a torment, that invites us to meditate What do you think about it? Oh how beautiful! Very beautiful, yes, beautiful! - I like it. What do you want? - There's no hurry. Well, Don Andr?s, you didn't like it very much After that you told me to forget that crap and be practical Yes, and I followed your advice and here I am And now you've come to see the progress you've made so far Something like that I never told you... How horrible were those years. Did I told you? No Did I tell you how I felt with every pore filled with coal And that it never fell off, no matter how I washed Didn't I tell you? And the worst were the cockroaches Cockroaches? I still have chills when remembering them You were good to me, Don Andr?s Well, that's good I need 10 kilos of coal Coal for the brazier? That belongs to another time There's no more of that, not even oak coal Oh well, I still need that kind of coal How about the coal made of olive's seeds I'm very sorry. - You don't have? - No - Is he crazy? - Me? - No, him. - No. - Well, goodbye Well, Don Andr?s, I'm leaving - How happy to see you again. - Thanks Well... - Say, can I take a look down there? - Of course - This is your home and you can do what you like. - Thanks Although I don't know if you are dressed for the occasion Be careful Luis, don't let the cockroaches eat you Of course lady, we have that coal We don't have any coal for the kitchen... I'll send the boy with the coal to your house Luis, prepare 20 kilos of coal and 20 of the special coal Right away, Don Andr?s Are you ok, Luis? This month you will pay the water I'm finishing aunt, almost ready Take this towel and dry yourself Thanks aunt Let me You're paying for the water What do you expect, I need to wash, right? Its that coal... I want to be clean, aunt, clean! Even if its the last thing I do in this world Luis, you're like a kid Are you going? I don't know I'll think about it I can't stay here forever, right? Don't go, I'll call your uncle right away So that he doesn't make you work too much You work too much Don't go Luis, don't go. Do it for me Without you this house would be different It will be empty But you don't let me go out at nights, or take a shower If I use a lot of water, if it's expensive, plus... Leave me alone You need a little bit of patience Well, it was 3am approximately When they rang the doorbell insistently And I looked at the balcony and saw 4 or 5 guys Dressed as civilians and with machine guns Armed with machine guns and pistols And they told me to open the door So I told my parents they came for me I went down, open the door. They pushed me. They asked who lived there and I said only my parents and me And they came in... I will always remember because it was July 9, two days from my birthday So, they came in, they pushed me They pointed me with a gun They told me not to shout They asked my name and I told them My parents were terrorized They told them not to get involved I was worried because my mom suffers from the heart, and something could happen But, its curious because... I have the impression that... She is telling it as if it happened long time ago Or like it was a dream A nightmare Almost like a psalm Something once happened to me A little girl, 9 years old She told me a terrible nightmare That she had that night And I asked her if the stuff she dreamt Had the same power as the things she lived Yes, sure, because I live it in the dream Well... Anyway, give me that Emilia, it's your turn I think we can try it We can approach in different ways You could treat it as something in the past Or like something that's happenning right now Or like if it was a dream Take it And you, Rafa, please read the part of the lawyer Yes, that part And Emilia, you don't have to follow the text exactly, you can improvise What they will say has been proved true by this comission According to different declarations that we have heard We call Ines My parents left the bedroom They were surprised and full of fear They threatened them also And in a bad manner, told them not to get involved That it wasn't about them My mother was very sick of the heart And I thought she would die of the shock They asked me about Ra?l, my partner And I told them I didn't know where he was At that moment it was true Because I didn't know where he was And that's why I was worried It was 2 weeks since I lived with my parents And I had not received any news from him You're coming with us That way you'll tell everything They told me And once in the street One of this guys He told me, don't even think about sceaming Or you will be sorry Help! Hel... - What's wrong? - Nothing, we are the police And once inside They put a gun to my head They forced me to put my head between the knees of one of them The sun was coming up That's the last thing I saw clearly Because later they put two pieces of cotton over my eyes And hold them very tight with tape I didn't resist because I was afraid They started to ask questions I don't remember their questions I was afraid The only thing I remember Is that we travelled Very fast I found myself in a dead end Because I've changed my job for something quite vague And it wasn't acting, which was something sacred to me then And it isn't now? Well, now it's a job like any other But a beautiful job sometimes Although I'm no actor now, just an spectator Things started to get better when my mother sent me some money And they accepted me in a theater play. But they almost fuck my ass - What?! - Yes *undistinguishable* And it wasn't because I was prejudiced That wasn't my problem The reason was I remember Uncle Pepe That one day very serious he said: Luisito, never confuse the ass with the pussy - Don't confuse... - The ass with the pussy! - Hey, Luis. - What? But, what are you doing?! Are you dead? Are you dead? I'm coming, Luisito We need to revive you, right? What's happening? Is something wrong? I love you, Emilia I love you more than anything in this world I was very afraid I was very afraid! They pushed me... Through a narrow hallway While I walked... I bumped into people... That were next to the wall and in the hallway They put me in a room They made me sit in a chair And they surrounded me, because I felt their breath on my neck and face Since the cottons they've put in my eyes were wet I could see a little now Peeping through I could see the boots of my executioners Some military boots And some black shoes with pointed endings And I could hear more loudly now the metallic noise That I will never forget And that I can still hear some nights It was a noise like knives crashing No, it sounded like... Like knives sharpening Mixed with the sound of a tv When the show is over I've said everything I know, I really don't know anymore I've told you everything! - We just need to know where is your friend? - That I don't know - Where is he?! - I don't know! You're gonna talk anyway, save yourself the suffering. - Where is your friend. - I don't know. - Where?! - If I knew I'd talked. Where is he?! What is it? Yes? Who is it? Who is it?! Who was it? Some funny guy... This is the third time they call I was dreaming something very strange I was blindfolded I took off the bandage and realized I had lost my memory And then... When I went out to the beach I realized I had lost my memory I couldn't remember anything Of who I was... Nor where did I live and who were my friends... And my relatives Where are you going? I don't know *Indistinguishable* - What a strange dream! - Huh? I was in the streets... How can I explain... They looked like photographs They seemed to know... Surprised in their walking The people where there but... They looked surprised Their usual gestures Static And the cars and buses too... And the bikes too, everything was... Like if life... Was suspended. And I started walking Through the streets... I entered a fashion shop It was a very strange place It was quite rare, large, huge! And there was nobody. And I walked there... It seemed as if I was looking for someone, something... but there was nobody And then... I looked above some perches And I saw a curtain half open... And inside... A mirror... There was a reflection of... A girl... Very young and pretty. A beautiful girl who was trying a skirt on. She was looking in the mirror... And she had a body... Incredible, and the skin... And then I got near... To the counter... And there was the girl... Looking in the mirror And I felt like touching her... And I reached with my hand... And suddenly... I look into the mirror And I can't see myself And the girl starts moving, normally... Finishes trying on the skirt. And then tries on a blouse And she leaves And I stay there Paralized... Looking at myself in the mirror She looked like someone, but I don't know who... She looked like one of your students They are all in love with you, did you knew? She looked like one of you students - You are very attractive. - Are you talking seriously? Of course I mean it Give me a kiss I'm sleepy Hi, doll - How are you? - Hello We start rehersals in the theatre this monday Very good Yes, its ok A little too soon We'll have to work harder We'll have to rehearse harder Emilia For me? Yes Is Manuel, right? Yes Look what I've advanced today Its ok - It's pretty, right? - Very pretty. Do you like it or not? Of course I like it It just that... Maybe you should use your time on something else Like in what? I don't know, I'm just saying If you like it, that's what matters It entertains me This is the last warning and your last chance I'm pissed off... this fuckers... Do you wanna read it? It's not necessary I think of you I want you to know what it says Emilia, this had to happen for me to understand what I've lost I've lost everything, Emilia And this house without you is empty and dead I can't tolerate your absence And I'm going out for a few days To think about myself and what will be of my life I only ask you to reflect on your decision If that's what you really want, tell me And I won't bother you any more But I want you to know... That I can't forget you And the more I try You are still here with me I love you and need you, Manuel Tell me something, please I don't want secrets between us, Luis That the happiness of one person Has to be done with the suffering of another It's sad If you had left I would had written a similar letter But you won't, right? Hey... It's because I... I couldn't... Hey... What is that? Huh? What is this face? Hey, fool What is that? You are a fool, I won't leave Fool... Luis... I won't leave you... Never, fool Emilia I'll never leave you Torture breaks the conscience Torture takes away information But above all, it awakens fear Sorry, Gustavo... Mount the scenery later and leave us alone Good, good Don't ennumerate, more fluid... And above all, it awakens fear That ancestral fear that lies asleep That fear we all have Fear to suffering Fear to darkness Fear of losing one's identity In a world of tied hands and eyes blindfolded We would like the witness to specify What kind of torture she suffered Without omitting details Because we believe its necessary to know To what level of cruelty those guys can reach They throwed me to the floor And once there they kicked me In the kidneys In the sides and finally in the belly Insulting me continually I told them everything I knew I said everything cause it hurt a lot and I just wanted them to stop It's enough of this bullshit, someone said: Now you will really tell us all I started to scream with all my strength Like crazy, I told them I knew nothing else Shut up, said someone else Pull your pants and underwear down I couldn't move with my handcuffs They took my clothes by force The buzz from before... Became much louder Oh my god, I thought, they'll use the prod now I open my mouth and I think they used the prod now because I try to shout but I can't I feel my throat closed And the current flows through my whole body The electric current shakes me The electric current shakes my whole body I feel as if they were tearing my arms, legs, everything - I can't... - Wait Yes, I forgot... They gave me... go on... They hit me on the breasts, on my genitals... I can't say it, it's too horrible Try, Emilia, try, try, come on I felt the shocks as shattering As if they were tearing my arms, legs, every body part I couldn't breathe I was choking, all my body was trembling My organism was convulsing like with an epileptic attack Good Okay, Emilia... Let's see... Andrew Wyeth, he is an american painter This is Christina It was a neighbor of his She was a paralytic, look... The arms I dreamt lot of times with this scenery Can I see the book With my tears the rocks turn soft and break down The trees seem to bend The birds that hear me, when singing, show condolence and my death with their singing they guess. The beasts, that lean their tired bodies, leave their dreams to hear my sad mourning. You, alone, turned harsh towards me Your eyes not even returning to what you made. Go, tears... What is it? Emilia, why don't you tell me what is it? I don't know what it is I don't know... I don't know where I'm going, I know nothing I can't go on like this... Can I help you in some way? No Please, Emilia, we once made a deal... That you don't even respect You have your life... You have your work that fulfills your life I need something else, I don't know what I need something else Yes, sure Emilia... The only thing I ask Is that... If you are with me is because you want to If not it is not worth it Why fool ourselves? What's your answer? Luis? "Son of a bitch" Luis? Oh my god... Luis?! Luis, what have they done to you? Can you walk? What have they done? Oh, Luis... - What have they done. - Nothing Hold on a little longer! Sit down My god... What shall I do? - Emilia. - Rest. It's not answering Emilia... Yes, Manuel! Yes, it's Emilia They've hurt Luis very badly You must come immediately, please Yes, it's quite serious Emilia, no... Yes, hurry up please, I don't know what to do... Emilia... no... I don't want him to see me like this If I die I want to die like this, fuck You won't die Oh mother, my pain! Fuck, such bad luck One day, or one night, I don't really know They changed me to another room And they brought a woman, I knew from her screams next door I could hear everything perfectly They insulted her and... I don't know what they did to her, but she screamed a lot I don't know how long it lasted because I felt asleep Well, only half asleep because... I dreamt I heard the voice of a soprano And in reality it was the woman screaming like crazy And she asked, "please not with the needle" "Not with the needle" she screamed I don't know if I felt asleep or not Because I have a blank in my mind What I do remember are the screams The metallic noise, the beatings... Someone who beat a sand bag to the floor I mix up things... I don't even know if what I'm telling now has really happenned... Or if I am imagining it That is my confusion... I think they interrogated me again I saw some lights that shined... And I remember... Some nice guys who offered me a cigarette And that spoke to me softly I heard the sound of a typewriter I didn't mind anything, I even felt good I don't remember if they made me sign or not... And that is something that makes me very anxious nowadays When I woke up I was lying in the floor I was very cold and was trembling I had the eyes blindfolded but my hands free I took off the bandages and found I was in a field. There was a house, or farm, something like that It was a beautiful sunrise The light, the life... I stayed in the ground, contemplating that scenery I felt the fresh air in the lungs And I suddenly began crying from happiness The next day I began my forced return to Spain, with my sons Of my partner Raul I haven't had any news And I can't say anything more I hope this testimony is useful to alert the public So they can condemn the military, authoritarian, and repressive regimes So acts like this won't happen again.
