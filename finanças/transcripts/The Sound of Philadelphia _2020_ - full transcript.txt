Here we go. Right. You guys know where I was this afternoon? Did I tell you? The proctologist. My doctor sent me to have a proctologist examination. They got an inverted chair that tilts up, with stirrups, right, gives them a better look at your asshole. So while I'm sitting there, looking at this thing, right, this nurse comes in. She pulls out a tube of lubricant, right, out of her uniform. She takes it out, she squirts a little bit on her finger, make sure it's coming out all right, and she lays that on the table, right next to the shiny instruments. Starting to get nervous. So she comes over to me... and she says, "If you go ahead and slip out of your trousers "and your fucking underwear, "the doctor will be with you in a minute." So she goes and walks towards the door, she stops all of a sudden, she looks me in the eye, and she says, "Relaxation is the key." And I'm like, "What?" She's like, "The more relaxed you are, "the quicker we'll be out of here." So she fucking leaves. I'm looking at this upside-down chair and these shiny fucking instruments and this tube of lubricant, and I'm like, "How the fuck "am I supposed to relax myself in here, right? "What can I do?" You jerked off in the doctor's office? You're goddamn... I jerked the fuck off and put that shit in the trash can under the desk. I did. I fucking did too. What if the nurse forgot one of the instruments and came back in? Maybe she'd stick her pinky up my butt, help me finish up. You're a dirty little fuck, ain't ya? So, like, um... Like, how much money do you make on a site like this? I've got 20 roofers working up here. How many of 'em really work up here? Maybe three? That shit is easy money, right? Ain't no such thing as easy money. You have no idea what I had to do to get this. Hey, Peter! What are you doing? You wanna piss over the side? What the fuck? What the fuck? Holy fucking shit! Peter! Peter! What the fuck, man? Are you all right? Don't worry, not the first time. You could have fucking killed yourself. Come on. What the fuck did you do that for? Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it. It's those journalists that I was telling you about. They found out that the city employed some of my family members, and pretty soon those people are all gonna be without a job. How many? Six. - He's gonna win. - Who? Cruz? No, Trump. I'm serious. I'll vote for him. He made billions, he can run this fucking country. Gentlemen, um... It'll be extremely helpful to me if those people that I just mentioned are viewed as, um, immediately employable in some other avenues of life. Please tell me you ain't asking me to make your mother a roofer? No, that's not what I'm asking. Then what are you asking me exactly? I don't know, um... Maybe you need a new secretary. You give all the work around here to companies employing roofers that ain't union, but you're asking me to help you? I want the pier at the Delaware River waterfront. I can't do that. That's... That's impossible. Why? I think you know why. Go ask your Italian friends to help your mama. Yeah? Where? What's going on? O'Meara is dead. What happened? Michael, what happened? Apparently some guys just picked him up on the street. They what? These guys just picked him up on the street, and he just gets in the car with them. He don't even try to run or anything. What the hell is wrong with people? It's like they want to die. - He had kids, right? - Yeah, three of them. His wife, she divorced him? Yeah, she left. We ought to take care of the kids for him. But none for her. Not a fuckin' cent. We'll pay for the funeral. That kid is really good, man. Did you talk to his dad? He's a crackhead. The kid's stayin' at my place. The question is, who put him in the car? I don't fucking know who did it. The guy just got killed. Well... I know we got to respond to this in a way that it ain't gonna happen again. I mean, that I can tell you. You don't know who, you don't know why, and you want to go to war? Do you remember when O'Meara got me my first lay? No. Day I turned 12, he let me baby-dick that hooker in the backseat of his Caddy. Ahh, ahh, ahh! You guys, look at what we've done to this fucking place. Hey, I just hired a new cook. Do you where he's from? Paris, France. They eat fucking frogs over there. No. Jesus Christ, it's not that we're serving French food. Like I said, it's just that the chef comes from France. - Fuck France. - He says fuck France. Hey, look, you guys remember Grace? What, your sister? - Grace. - Yes. - Holy shit. Grace? - Mmm-hmm. Yep. No fucking way. - Good to see you. - Good to see you! Look at you! Shit! I thought you were... I thought you were living down in Florida with your mom? Um, I was, but I am going to Jefferson now. - Ah. - Mmm-hmm. Grace is gonna work at the bar and stay at my place for a while. - Fantastic! - Mmm-hmm. Look at you, look how beautiful she is. Like no fucking way she's your sister. Let's get some fucking champagne or something... - Yeah! - Let's celebrate. - Yes. - Good job, Jimmy. Okay. Know what I'm saying? Excited? Yeah, I definitely am. That was really fucking good. That was excellent. - Pretty good one, right? - Yeah. Okay? Huh? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right, man. You good? Are you all right? Yeah, perfect Here. Let's go home. - One more drink. - No, come on. It's late, let's... - Nah, I gotta have one more drink, Peter. - Let's go home. You're a good guy, just... You're a good guy, your cousin too. He helped me out with the restaurant and everything... - What do you mean? - What? - What do you mean? - Just trying to say thank you, that you helped me out with the restaurant - and everything... - No, no, no, no. Did you... Did you borrow money from Michael? Did you? Because if you did, don't sit around thinking it's gonna take care of itself. It's not. It's not a friendly thing, do you understand that? Hey, hold on a second, hold on a second, we grew up together, right? What the fuck do you mean? He's your cousin, man. Yeah, he's my... Exactly, you said it. He's my cousin, not yours. How much? I don't know. I don't remember. You don't remember? Well, he remembers everything. Don't get in too deep, I'm telling you. Don't fuck with him. I only borrowed a little money for the restaurant. I'm gonna pay him back soon. I am. It's not gonna be a problem. - Jimmy? - Yeah. Don't forget what I said. No, no, no, no. No, I know. Stop! The fuck... - Hello. - Peter, it's me. Jimmy, I'm sleeping. It's Michael. He got shot. What? They were waiting for him in front of the restaurant. I wasn't there. But Grace was, and she said... Is he dead? - Where is he? - In there. Go on in. Remember when we got our first paychecks? And we got wasted up on that roof? You jumped. Busted your tailbone. I thought you did it to pick up a disability check, but you never missed a day's work. Who did this? Michael? Bono's men. - Why? - What don't you understand? The Italians killed O'Meara, and now they're trying to do me. Why did they kill him? They want what we got. I need your help, Peter. If I'm gonna hold on to this, I gotta have somebody I can trust. What, they want it all, or they want a share? What's the fucking difference? Now it's a share, but tomorrow they'll take everything from us. You know we can't fight them. They want a share? Just give it to them. We don't have to do what they say anymore. - The streets belong to me. - Michael listen to me. Your father made a deal a long time ago. It's lasted so long that everyone who made it is dead. And before him, they killed McCullough, because he was fucking with the Italians in Atlantic City. They realized that the jobs are still a source of money and power in the city, and that you still control it. If you don't give them what they want, - you know what's gonna happen. - You have to be on my side. You're my brother. You're the only one I can trust. What's going on? Come sit down. What the fuck is going on? - What are you all doing here? - It's the baby. She... She got hit by a car. Look, it was nobody's fault. - The fucking guy's car slid... - What guy? The neighbor. You mean Victor Kopec? The cop? Charley! Charley, stop! Charley! - Get off of me! - No, no. Get the fuck off of me. Let me go! Let me fucking go! Get off! Now that's an excellent horse. There ain't nothing wrong with her. It's got fucking spaghetti legs. She's come from a long line of champions, the bloodline... I don't give a fuck where she comes from. Fuck that horse. - Mr. Flood... - Fuck you! Can you believe this motherfucker trying to sell me a horse like that? Tell him I want a big horse. - That horse look big to you? - Yeah, it's a racehorse. - That's a shit horse. - No, it's a racehorse. That's a shit horse. I can spot a champion when I see one, and that's a fucking shit horse. What do you know about horses? You like boxing? I like horses. Whatever, man. Hey, that kid Carlos is training... Jimmy tells me he's special. Jimmy doesn't know shit about fighting. So is the kid good or not? Yeah, he's good enough. Maybe you talk to him, maybe we get him somewhere. - Get him somewhere? - Hmm. He is good where he is. The kid could make some money now, that ain't going to last forever. That's all I'm saying. Maybe you talk to him, let him know we help him. They don't need us to make money. I told you, he's good where he is. Relax. You talk about these guys like they're family or something. - Hey. - Hey. Can I get a beer? Yep. How's, uh... - How's Michael doing? - He's all right. What about you? Sounds like you were pretty close. I was still inside closing up. I didn't hear the gunshot, just heard people screaming. Jimmy told me you're working for Michael now. - No, I'm just helping out. - Doing what? Don't tell me you're a roofer. You know what we do. Jimmy grew up with us. It's not a secret. Taking over the family business? Yeah, kind of. You know, when we were kids, I always thought that you were different than your cousin. Oh, look at him go. Look, I know that in his mind, he thinks he's a real boxer. He thinks that he can be a world champion one day. Fucking give it up, Peter. You look like dog shit. - How you are doing, Carlos? - I'm okay. I was... I was wondering if the kid was around. Maybe he could give my man Lenny here a couple of rounds. He's run to Jersey for some parts. He works for me now, at the garage. Oh, to Jersey? He gonna come back, or what, eh? Don't worry about him. He just wants to move a few rounds with the kid. Just taking it real easy. What do you say, Carlos? I told you, he's in Jersey. Oh, shit, look at that. There he is. How you doing, Ryan? How was Jersey? What's the weather like over there? How are you doing? I've been hearing good things about you. You look strong. - What's your weight? - 125. A buck twenty-five? What do you say you give my man Lenny here a couple of rounds? I wanna see you guys move. Three rounds? Three, four, five. Whatever you want. He said... He thinks he can kick your ass. I don't think so. I wanna see you work, kid. Come on. Let's go. Man, it's gonna be fun. Let's go. There's no reason to do this, man. I wanna see the kid work, that's the reason. You keep saying how fucking good he is. I wanna see if he can fight. So why don't you come by next week, and you can see him work? You don't have to bring in a fucking monkey. It's insulting. So somebody's insulted. So the fuck what? Hey, by the way, where were you last night? At the restaurant. Oh, yeah? With Jimmy? Yo, check it out. A fight. Yo, we gonna do this? All right. Let's see what my monkey can do. Hey, he's a buck twenty-five, Lenny. Touch him. Yeah. There it is. The fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? Get the fuck up. Get... Wake the fuck up. He's, like, half your size. You let him knock you out like that? You're right, he's a fucking monkey. Get the fuck up. Get the fuck out of there. Get the fuck out of the ring. Get the fuck up, Lenny. Get out of here. Don't bleed in my car. Be in touch, Ryan. Very nice. Very, very nice. Your dad here? Go get him. I told you not to come in here. What do you want? Uncle Phil's here. So what are you doing here? The guy's calling Constantine eleven times a day, sayin' you're gonna do him. All right, don't tell me you're comin' in here, telling me what I'm gonna do. No, I came to tell you what you ain't going to do. He's helpin' the Italians on some... On some things, Charley. Constantine don't want him hurt. There's lots of cops helpin' him on some things. How come this one's got to move in next door, in an Irish neighborhood, the place where we grew up, and drive his big old convertible up and down the street like some Center City pimp? The guy took my baby, Phil! He took my baby. It was an accident. Constantine don't want the guy touched. Yeah, well, fuck Constantine! And fuck the Italians. First they're in our business, now they're in my house? The man skidded. If it was something else, I'd have taken care of him myself, right there, that afternoon. You know what? You can get the fuck out of here! Dad? Go to bed. - Hello? - Hey, Peter, it's Bono. I understand you've got medical problems in the family... - Yeah, what do you want? - Maybe we should talk about it. Or you might be thinking of takin' over the business. So maybe we can work something out. Think about it and call me. Who's this guy? I gotta talk to you. Sometimes I wonder what the fuck I need you for in the first place. I get shot, you're not around. I come up to Carlos', and you act like you're ashamed we're cousins. What are all these knuckleheads doing out here? - We're making a move. - You're making a move? Well, they tried to do me. We're not just gonna do one of them. We're going to end this fuckin' thing, that's what's next. But the Italians have been around for, like, what, a hundred years? And you're gonna end it? This is Philly, everything in this fuckin' city's been around for a hundred years. Yeah? What are you gonna do? I'm turning them loose. Turn them loose? These guys? Mmm-hmm. The only way to do that is when you tell them exactly what it is you want them to do. And then you promise them that you'll cut off their hand if they do it in any other way. You hear me? And maybe, maybe if you're lucky, you'll only get jammed up half of the time. But we ain't jammed up. You're not? We know who did O'Meara. I'm telling you... You put these guys on the street, I'm out. I'm going to Hawaii. You want them off the street? Then you take care of business with me. Or go to fucking Hawaii, and don't come back. Pour that one out, please. Why? Somebody died. Pour it. So, what happened to your mother... She got scared of things that wasn't there. First, she wouldn't go out by herself, then she wouldn't go out even if I was with her. Then, finally, it scared her so bad that she's afraid to even move her little finger. She thinks if she moves her little finger, it wakes up, and remembers what happened to your sister. She thinks if she just keeps everything still, it don't hurt. I wanna see her. It ain't the kind of hospital you can visit her. They, uh... They wouldn't let me get my dogs. Who'd... Who would want to burn up a couple little dogs? - Let's take your shoes off. - Okay. Okay. He was there. He was there when it happened. Listen, they're not looking for Jimmy. You're safe, don't worry. Don't worry. Peter, what's going on? Oh... Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, what are you doing? Come on, get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Come on. They wouldn't let me get the dogs. I told them, "I don't care what you do, "just let me get my dogs out of your way." I asked him, the guy at the door. I said, "Could I please have the dog?" And he wouldn't answer me. And I can hear 'em in the back, barking at the one in the basement, but the guy at the door wouldn't let me in. Here you go. Here you go. Tell me what happened. I told them, "it's none of my business what you're doing, "just let get my dogs out of there first." And he wouldn't answer me. And then... Only, I didn't want to go in there. 'Cause if I walk in there, I'm dead, and... I ain't even got nothing to do with this. And then, the one at the door said that I better, uh, go call Michael, and tell him what's happening to his place. I said, "It's my place. "It isn't Michael's." But he just says I better go back across the street. So, I go call Michael, but then Leonard says he's asleep. And then, while I'm on the phone, I hear a noise. It sounds like somebody blowing out a candle. And it shakes the house. And then, when I looked out the window, the inside of the place is already orange. The fuck you doing here, huh? I want to talk to Bono. I told you to call me, not to come. Yeah, it's right here. Let's go. - Michael send you? - No. What are you doing here? Shit's getting out of hand. Yeah, well, he started it, not me. That's not what he said. Oh, yeah? O'Meara tried to extort my guys. I asked Michael if he can fix it. Michael says sure, he can fix it, but he don't do it. So I do a little investigation, and guess what? Him and O'Meara are working together. Trying to take construction sites from us. So, you know, there's three sides to every story, yours, mine, and the truth. And the truth is he's done, he's gotta go. Is there any way We can just, you know... I mean, forget about all this? No. But you stand to make out. I'm gonna need somebody. You understand? I mean, I can't just walk into the unions and announce they're under new management. It's kind of hard for me to... For me to trust you, you know that? Oh, no, Peter, I liked your father. And Constantine liked your father. Your father was a fuck-up. The real question here... Are you just another stupid Irish fuck? You want a beer? Yeah. First thing about drinking beer... Never take the cap off with your teeth. It doesn't matter if all your friends use their teeth. In the end, they're gonna break one off. Wait and see. It's the same thing as hittin' walls. Every Irish wedding you go to, there's always gotta be some guy hitting a wall. Your Uncle Phil was a good wall puncher. The thing about that, besides it's stupid, is you can't always tell where the studs are. And, man, it's one thing to put your fist through drywall, it's something else when you hit the studs. There's no excuse for hurting yourself on purpose. The Italians know that. Irish don't. It's why they run things, and why we don't. You like it? - No. - Then don't drink it. Uncle Phil... I don't really like him. - Why do you say that? - I don't know. He's... He's fucked up. Jesus, that's too good. We take him down to the gallops this morning, trying to keep everybody happy, get him into shape so he can race, like you said. I get the vet to take a picture. He broke a bone. It's not a bad break, it's just that... The truth is, it's not a very a sound horse. And sometimes it happens. What you're saying is this horse that I bought for $80,000 ain't really a racehorse. It's just... Horses' legs are delicate things, and something happened. Maybe his breeding was bad, maybe... I don't know, he's just too fucking big. You think this is funny? It's too fucking big? It could be that, it could be his father, his mother. You're supposed to shoot those fuckin' things, right? What are you doing? What are you doing? Put that gun away. Put that gun away. Get out of the way. - You're not... - I own the fucking thing. You can't shoot the horse. As long as you have been around here, have you ever seen somebody else shoot their horse? You ever seen anyone else around here that's got a horse that ain't a fucking horse? Lots of broken down horses, Mr... You already talked, telling me the horse is too big. My cousin's talking now, telling me I can't shoot the motherfucker. When he's through telling me what I can do, then it's your turn again. Put that gun away. Normally, they inject them. - With a needle? - Yeah, nice and easy. Hmm. A needle. Go get it. What the fuck is wrong with you? It's my horse. You the owner? Owner's signature. Come on, let's go. Hold him. That's... $240, please. You, uh, want me to have somebody come get this? You want me to take care of it, or you want to have it done yourself? I changed my mind. You hear what I said? - You said you... - Michael... The horse is dead. Let's go. Come on. He's a big shot. You wanted him to put the horse down, that's what he did. Come on, let's go, come on. Hey. Hey, Leonard, gimme that bag. Since when do you decide? Ain't your horse. Ain't your business. Be careful with that shit, Mr. Flood. If you got a cut or something and that gets in, it doesn't take much. Like one drop of this... It gets in your bloodstream, yeah. And if you put this into a person... They'd be dead before you could get it half in. So how much of this you got? How much you need? See, I like this guy better already. Let's go. Come here. Let's... Let's go. I can have this one here? All you want. You don't, you don't mind if I take it? No, sir. Thank you. Sorry, you wanted to ask me something, right? Uh, just about taking care of your horse. If you wanted me to take care of him for you. Yeah, I would appreciate that very much. No problem, I'll do it right now. But first... I want you to get on your fucking knees and kiss him goodbye. Morning, Peter. Want to get in so we could talk? What do you want to talk about? Well, we heard a story. A veterinarian filed a complaint against Michael. The vet said Michael made him kiss a dead horse. Yeah, so what? Yeah, I can squash the complaint. I'll even have my lawyer draw up the papers, but what does that say about your business? How much longer you think before someone pulls it out from under you? You need help, we could save it for you. It's gonna cost you though. You're gonna kill your brother. Well, he's not my brother, he's my cousin. Oh, well, that makes it a lot easier then, don't it? Either way, he's not where he's at for long. Don't... I don't hear nothing. Are you thinking about this? No, I'm not. Let me approach this another way. Who do you think set up your father to Constantine? Somebody wanted what he had, someone wanted to be like him, wasn't tough enough or respected enough and never would be. You got no clue? Your uncle. No way. I watched your uncle bury your dad. See, I worked for Constantine back in the day. I watched your uncle bash your father's face in, over and over with the shovel, so he wouldn't be recognized when they found him. Why are you telling me all this? Oh, so you'd realize what Michael would do if he was standing right here and I made him the same offer. You see, because at the end of the day, he's still his father's son. You hear what I'm saying to you, Petey? It's your move. What's going on? How long until Jimmy's got a problem with Michael? What do you mean, a problem? For the money he owes him. Stay out of it. Don't you dare tell me to stay out of it. Your cousin came over here yesterday, put a fucking needle to my brother's neck, and told him this is what they use to fucking kill horses. Jimmy's restaurant burned down because of Michael. First, Michael says it's not his problem, now he's threatening to kill him for $95,000. - There's nothing I can do. - Of course you can, he's your cousin. Doesn't work like that. I told Jimmy, you know, not to get involved with Michael. And now he owes him. There's nothing I can do. Okay then. If you're not gonna do anything, I'll take care of it. What are you gonna do? You're gonna go to the cops? Just think about what will happen. Exactly. Stay out of this. It's not your world. You're just like Michael, but I think you're worse. Because you're a fucking coward. The man that killed your sister... I took care of him. It's gonna be all right now. Come here. He came over in the afternoon when I was out. Leonard and the kids just beat the fucking shit out of him. Michael, what the fuck? I can't believe this happened. I told you they were fucking idiots. Look at the guy. Come on, look at him. He looks like a lawyer. Eh... How can they not spot the difference? Come on. Why do you think they sent him? To fix your fuck-up with the vet, like I told you. - I know. - Look at this mess. I know. Fucking idiots! Call the fucking doctor. Come on. - I mean, I... - No, call him right now. I can't let the guy out of here. I mean, I got no choice about that. The way they did him, I mean, he's crippled. Maybe the guy just disappears. Oh, yeah. So you think they don't know they sent him? We say he never got here. No. You know what you're gonna do? You're gonna pick up the phone and you're gonna call them and tell them exactly what the fuck happened. And you tell them that your guys got too excited when he showed up at the door, and they beat him up. They'll get it. They'll understand. And then you'll tell them that if they want the guys who did it, that you will, you know? You will give it to them. And they can do whatever the fuck it is they want. They can break them, they can burn them, whatever. Yeah. It's the only choice you got. Look at this mess. I'll help you with it. All right? I'll help you with it. I need a favor in return. Oh, yeah? What's that? Go easy on Jimmy about the money. Jimmy, hmm? You've seen Jimmy walk the streets, right? That means I went easy on him. Now he's got to come up with it. Man, come on. What happened to the restaurant is not his fault. Fuck does that mean? "His fault." You know what that means. Come on, man, cut him some slack. He owes me money. I'll pay it. No. No. He needs to pay me back, and you need to mind your own fucking business. All right, fine. You deal with this shit all by yourself. All right. Just tell Jimmy to relax. Jimmy! Jimmy. Jimmy? He ain't here? How come you got it so dark? It doesn't matter to me. I think you spend too much time alone. You come sit down? They said his head was cut halfway off. They found him in the trunk of his car. You can't tell your old man nothing. Never could. He'll sit there, just like you, listening to somebody as long as they want to talk, then go do exactly what he was gonna do anyway. You supposed to be up? It's 9:30. You supposed to stay up till 9:30? You're lucky. Your Aunt Theresa don't let Michael stay up at all. Right after he has done his schoolwork, he's up to his room. Your father's got a nice house here. Nice park across the street. Dentists live in houses like this. Hey, hey, where are you going? It's him. He don't want you running outside this time of the night. Hmm? Yo. Where you been? Did you get something to eat? All right, go on upstairs and let me talk to your uncle. You didn't hear me or what? He's just like you. Doesn't listen. Go on. Don't let me catch you sitting on the stairs listening. Go on. One, two. Jab. Jab. One, two. Work, Ryan, move, move. - Get in. - What's going on? Come on, open the trunk. The trunk is full. What, you pop the lawyer? Get in. He was getting infected, he was going delirious. He made so much noise I couldn't even hang out in my own place. What am I supposed to do? There's no reason for us to do this by ourselves, you know. The reason is, I want to make sure it's done right. I know the place to do this. Oh, you know a place. What place? A place my father showed me. So what we're saying, if it comes up... The guy was fine when he left the house. That's it. See, there was a problem with the way you wanted us to explain to them what happened. The time. The longer it goes, the worse it gets. The afternoon when you came over, there's already been a day, a day and a half. If I turn him over then, it looks like I decided to do one thing and got scared, tried to do something else. It makes us look weak. I think you've used this hole before. All of a sudden, I'm digging up bones and shit like that. That's deep enough. Get out of there. It's deep enough. You know what I was thinking? Maybe we give that kid at the gym to the Italians. I'm sure they could make a shit-ton of money with him. Maybe it'll make them forget about all this. Peter? What do you think? You're on your own now. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Thanks. Hey! I wanted to thank you for taking care for everything. Yeah, don't say that. Since you've called, nothing feels real. So what are you gonna do? I don't really know, I... I don't think I want to stay here. It's his city, you know. I see him everywhere. Maybe Florida. All right then. Take care. Are you going somewhere? What are you gonna do now? I don't know. I don't know. You should come visit me in Florida. Yeah, I can do that. I can do that. So this is your parents' place? Yeah. I used to live here till my... Till my sister died. Then I moved to Michael's place. What about your parents? My mom had a breakdown, and my dad was killed. Jimmy told me about your sister but not about your parents. If it's so painful, why did you come back? Well, it's my home, you know. I belong here. When my parents died, I tried to live in their house, but I couldn't. That's why I came here. For a fresh start. Go back to school, and be close to my brother. And take care of him. When you found him, what did you think? I thought... I thought, "Fuck, I'm late. "I'm too fucking late." See you, guys. What are you doing here? Carlos! Michael, what are you doing here? Carlos. Carlos. No sparring today. I brought this guy over here. Get ready. He actually used to be a real fighter. And I want to see him move around with your kid. This ain't the place for somebody like that. Listen to me, Carlos. I saw your kid move around the other day, and I thought it was really impressive. Now I want to see him move around with a real fighter. That's why I brought this guy in here. - Michael, stop it. - Am I talking to you? I didn't think so. This is my gym. I know it's your fucking gym. And that's why I brought a fighter in here so he can move around with your kid. Carlos look at me. Look at me! I'm asking you for a favor here. You understand? And I think you want to fucking give me that favor, - do you understand? - You fuck! Carlos, come on! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! - Hey, Lenny... Lenny. - Stop it! Put the fucking gun down! Hey, Carlos... I'll see you around. And, Ryan... I'll see you around, too. Peter, you comin'? Get out of my gym! Hey. Uh... Look, uh... It's not gonna be easy, I know. Something bad happened to your father. Don't worry. We're family. You're gonna move with us. With Aunt Theresa, Cousin Michael... Uh... You won't be alone anymore. I'll look after you. You're like my own son now. Get your stuff. I'll wait for you downstairs. We do them in the morning. See, you know what I wish? I wish there was a moment where what's gonna happen is right there with what already happened. So Carlos can see it, the cause and the effect. How do I do that? What I really want is that we kill him more than once, but... We park a car in front of his garage door in the morning, so when the kid gets out of the car to open the door, then bam, bam, we do him right there on the sidewalk, in front of Carlos. You got to make sure that he sees it before you do him. I don't really care who does who. But you got to do the kid first. So Carlos sees it. Are you gonna try and talk me out of this? Hmm? No, there's not much more to talk about, right? Hey, you know, I was just thinking maybe it's better if you do Carlos yourself, you know, just to keep it in the family.
