[MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Into a brief 30 minutes each day, is condensed the heartbeat of American living. A cross-section of the lives of everyday people. The neighbor next door. The family across the street. Their love, happiness, problems, tragedy, and laughter. During those 30 minutes, 5 million women are listening, perhaps finding a mirror of their own thoughts, and hopes, and dreams. The stories are as varied as there are human hearts and emotions. DIRECTOR: 10 seconds. NARRATOR: These are some of them. DIRECTOR: Five seconds. Would you like to be "Queen for a Day?" [MUSICAL FANFARE] Hello, hello, from "Queen for a Day," the Cinderella show. Here at our Don Lee Studios, in the heart of Hollywood, we have five royal candidates, waiting to tell you the dreams that will send one of them on a thrill-packed day in the film capital of the world. And now, here is our Master of Ceremonies, with a barbecue pit in one hand, and a recipe he can't read in the other, your Mutual friend, Jack "What's Cooking?" Bailey. Thank you, neighbors, thank you, and welcome to "Queen for a Day." And a great big welcome to you folks at home, too. Yes, and this is going to be a great day for Her Majesty the Queen. Our station wagon is heaped high with treasures for the royal candidate elected today's queen. And now, here's our first candidate. Yes, you're candidate number one, and... uh, let's get away from him. That is Jim Morgan, and he just produces the show. He thinks he's the boss. He isn't. I am. All you have to do is just talk to me. My name is Mary Collins. Oh, is that so? Yes, sir. Uh-huh. Where do you and Mr. Collins live? In Pomona. In Pomona. Well, that's, uh, lovely country up there, to raise children, or anything, isn't it? I guess it is. Yeah. Is this your first attempt at children? Yes, sir. I see. And what would you like, if you're elected our queen? I'd like an automatic egg cleaner. A, a what? An automatic egg cleaner? You have to sand them with sandpaper, if you don't have them on a... um, on, um... if you don't have them on an automatic one. And... Oh, yeah. And our chickens are gonna start laying so many eggs, I don't think I'm going to have enough time to sand all those eggs by hand. Sand the eggs. Ha. And, um, you can get them automatic. They're on a, a belt. Oh. And they get brushed by themselves. Wonderful. And my husband will be able to stay in college. He can stay in college? Yes, sir. He's just got to stay, and get his diploma, and be a minister. Well, Mrs. Collins, if you're elected our queen, we'll get you one of those steam things for sure, and you can throw away the sand. Yes, sir, that's our first candidate for today. Well, don't you even make a small automatic egg cleaner that... that cranks? Here's the file of letters from our past winners, and the posting on the club meeting. Oh, thanks, Helena. Oh, these are fine. Yeah. Jack, do you remember a few months ago, Pete and his railroad engine? Pete? Pete? No. Remember his mother threw you when she said he was an engineer yesterday? Oh, yeah. She said, an engineer yesterday, and I said, what is he today? She said, I haven't any idea what he'll be when I get home. Yes, I'm not very apt to forget Pete. I guess asking for a kid's toy didn't seem very important, compared to the other wishes that day. No, I guess not. But I got to thinking about him again the other day, and I wrote to his mother, to find out more about him. Oh? And Jack, I sent the engine. You did? Well, good. Got an answer. "Dear Mr. Morgan, it was so wonderfully kind of you to remember Pete, after all this time, and to send him the engine. MARJORIE (VOICEOVER): I want you to know how happy you made him. I don't think he ever treasured any other gift so much. If this letter grows long tonight, it's because I want to recapture all the little details of memory, for myself, too. Life moves so swiftly, that we forget, so often, and so much. I remember, one day he was a farmer. The busiest farmer in 11 counties. He looked over the property that morning, with Mr. Pettigrew, and decided on the acreage north of the first big tree. It was the smallest farm in the world. You could kneel, and put your arms around it. It'll rain before night. [BARK] We gotta hurry up and get the seeds in. [BARKING] -Whoops... Oh, Mr. Pettigrew, I wish you were as helpful as you are affectionate. Hi, Pete. Hi, Mother. What are you doing? Farming. Oh. Seeds. What are you planting? Oh, corn, potatoes, flowers, strawberries and things. Mm. We'll have good food all winter. That's wonderful, Pete. I am Mr. Palmer. Oh. You're the man who owns the big farm down the road, too. Yes, but it's all planted. Where's Anna? In the kitchen, baking cookies. Want to come in and have one? Busy. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BARKING] Pete... Come here to me. There's nothing coming. Pete Watkins. Mr. Palmer. How many times have I told you? Lots. But the horses went by. Horses? With the crops. Fertilizer. [SOUND OF TRAIN] [TRAIN BELL] Hello, Mr. Smith! [BARKING] Hey, Mr. Pettigrew. How are you? Hi, darling. Hi, kids. Oh... Hi, Daddy. Oh... Come on. Take this hungry man home, and feed him. Yeah. [TRAIN WHISTLE] Whoo-whoo... whoo... whoo... whoo, whoo... MARJORIE: Time for bed, Mr. Palmer. I'm Mr. Smith, now. Oh. Oh, Daddy... does Mr. Smith get paid for driving the train engine? Why, sure, of course he does. Why? Well, why not? Do people get paid for having fun? Well, sure they do, if they like their jobs. Come on, Mr. Smith. Time for bed, for you. There we go. One. Two. Did you have a good day at the office? Oh, OK. Except I wish you hadn't been on that "Queen for a Day" program. You know, they're still ribbing me about it? They're trying to make me run for king. Mm. You'd make a beautiful king. I can just see you, surrounded by women. Heh, heh, heh. I'll bet you can. Ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch, ch-ch... Driving a train engine is the best job in the world. Yes, it is, Pete. You know, someday, when we get enough money saved up, I'm gonna chuck this job for a year or two, and then your mother and I'll get on your train, and we'll travel all over. Yes, sir. Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo... Sometimes I worry about him, Dan. Why? Well, he should have kids to play with. I wish a few would move in around here, his age. Ah, he'll have companionship when he starts in school. I wonder what it'll be like, having him away all day, too? Cheer up. You might say he's away all day as it is. Hey, what's that? Well, that's Pete's farm. He's been Mr. Farmer all day. Pete lugged water from the house, pail after pail. Oh, I thought I'd never get him clean. What's he planting? I don't know. He found some seeds in the garage. Heaven knows what. Do you suppose all children are as imaginative? Weren't you? I can't remember. Gee... neither can I. Your mother told me once that you had an imaginary dog for a long time. You used to take him walking. But he was very small, so you always lifted him up, over the curb. (LAUGHING)I hadn't thought of that in years. She said you'd stand for minutes, while you waited for him. Waited for him? At hydrants. How old were you when you lost him? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, Pete'll be all right. [CLUNK, CLUNK] [CLUNK, CLUNK] [CLUNK, CLUNK] [CLUNK, CLUNK] [CLUNK] ANNA: Pete? I am Mr. Buzzini. Oh, you are, are you? Well, plumbers don't work on Sunday. Mr. Buzzini does. He makes more money on Sunday. The pipes are in awful shape, ma'am. Rusty. Well, you fix them tomorrow, Mr. Buzzini. And you better come in and get dressed up, because your aunt and cousin will be here any minute. Charles? Yes. And you don't want him to look nicer than you. Well, they might get a flat tire. Peter. Come. I hope they do. Hello. Hello. Hello, Peter. Hello, Aunt Laura. My, how nice you look. Anna made me. Heh, heh, uh, would you rather sit on the lawn, uh, Laura? Oh, let's do. It's so beautiful, after the city. Now, Charles, you run along and play with your cousin, and get to know each other better. Laura, I'll have Anna bring us some tea. Would you like some? LAURA: Oh, I'd love some. No, I'd rather have the tea, if you don't mind. MARJORIE: All right, well, I'll tell her to come right away. Go on, Charles. Play nicely with Peter. Peter... Peter? Peter? Where are you? Peter? Peter? [CAW... CAW] CHARLES: Oh, Peter... oh. What in the heck are you doing? Sh. CHARLES: Well, what are you doing? After a zebra. See? CHARLES: Zebra? That's Mr. Pettigrew. It is a zebra. Silly name for a dog. Want to play catch? No. Oh, all right. You're too little, anyway. Ow! Aah... Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha... Is Charles going to have hot turkey stuffing? MARJORIE: Yes. Pete, why did you do it? Mr. Pettigrew is a zebra. Oh, Pete, darling, Mr. Pettigrew is a zebra only for you. Don't you understand that? For Charles, he's just a dog. I don't like Charles. I'm going now. I'd like to take Charles a message from you. Shall I tell him you're sorry? For what? For hitting him with a stone. It, it wasn't a friendly thing to do, and it was dangerous. You might have injured him seriously. I meant to. But you can't throw stones at him just because he doesn't see things your way. Suppose I threw things at Aunt Laura? You'd be ashamed of me, wouldn't you? Ha, ha, ha. You can't throw. You couldn't hit her, ever. [DOOR CLOSES] Aw. Pete's sorry, Charles. He is not. Oh, don't fuss. I'm sure he didn't mean it. He did, too. Look, Charles. Pete lives in his own world. Maybe you did, too, at his age. In his world, Mr. Pettigrew is a zebra. You could've pretended. Heck, what a silly game. Who wants to pretend? Well, you do. You pretend you're Joe DiMaggio. Well, that's different. Baseball players are real. Zebras are real. Ah... Your husband is as bad as Pete. Oh, I don't know why we're arguing. People outgrow it. After all, he is a bright little boy, being so much with older people. He's a dope, and he gives me a pain in the neck. Charles. I told you I'd have no more of that talk. Now, you go into the living room and sit there alone for a half hour. I don't want to. Charles. Charles. [THWACK, THWACK] CHARLES: No, Mommy, no... ah... ah... Welcome home. Oh, hi, Anna. How's everything, Anna? Fine... just fine. You had a good time. Perfectly scrumptious. We went dancing, both evenings. And I got the most wonderful school clothes for Pete. Did he go to bed on time? Mr. Hannigan went to bed on time. The well driller? Shun decided we needed a new water well. Shun? Who's Shun? "Dis-tinc-tion." Shun for short. He's another one of those. Oh, no. When did he get this one? When he broke the plate of doughnuts. He said, Shun did it. Now he asks me to set a place for Shun at each meal. [BARKING] Mother... Dad! Come on, Shun. His legs are so short, he can't go very fast. Come on. Pete. My mother and dad. This is my friend, Shun. How do you do, Shun? I'm sorry to hear about your accident. A, accident? I hear he broke the doughnut plate. Aw, he's awful little, Dad. I told him not to carry it. But he's stubborn. And he carried it, and somehow, it dropped. Well, uh, maybe you better carry it next time. Yes. I guess I'll have to. Come on, Shun. [CLUNK] MARJORIE: Pete. I didn't do it. Shun did. MARJORIE: Well, you know that isn't so. I told him he's got to drink his milk. But he didn't take the glass. Has he finished with his dessert? Yes. So have I. Excuse us. Yes, Pete. Come on, you milk spiller. You know, Dan, he can't grow up to be a buck passer. It was cute when he had Toby, but with Shun... (LAUGHING)Don't forget Benny. I want to forget Benny. And Toby, and Shun. Oh, honey, he'll be all right. He's too old now, Dan. I won't have it. You've got to put an end to Shun, right now. Well, you think I should? Yes, I do. Well, I, uh, guess I'll have a talk with this dreamer upper. Pete... Pete? Where are you? We're in the well drilling office. Do you want a well dug? No, I don't think so, today. We've got the water well down about 30 feet. That's fine. Pete, uh, you think we ought to talk about that glass of milk? I already talked to Shun about it. It isn't like you not take the blame for things you've done, Pete. I don't like it. But I don't. Are you sure? Shun does things. He's much smaller than you are, Pete. And younger. He hasn't got the sense you have. If he does things that you'd like to do, but know you mustn't, aren't you to blame, for letting him? Maybe I am. I'll have another talk with him, I guess. Your mother and I think he ought to go away on a vacation. Mm, Mexico, or somewhere. Oh, no, Dad... please. He's my friend. He's gotta go to school with me Monday. You think he'd behave himself? I know he would. I'd do all his work for him, and he wouldn't do one thing wrong. Please? [KNOCKING] [SIGH] Softy. Would you like to take over? We're both such towers of strength. [KNOCKING] Oh, Mr. Garmes. Hello, Mrs. Watkins. Hi, Jeff. Hello, Dan. Oh, please, come in. Oh, I can't. Martha's cooking chicken and dumplings. And if I let them fall... Jonesy asked me to drop this by, for Pete. Oh. For me? Well, thank you so much. So long. Bye, Jeff. What is it? Let's see it. Let's open it. From the "Queen for a Day" program. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Watch out, pal. Oh. My. I wonder what's in it? Well, hurry up. Well, let's get it open, then. Come on. Oh... an engine. Well, that was mighty nice of them, to do this. But why? Well, I can't understand it. I didn't win. [TRAIN WHISTLE] Bed time, Pete. What, already? Oh, honey, just 10 minutes more, eh? 15. My engine. Just like Mr. Smith's. I'm going to put you and Mother in the brake car, and take you all over the world, to Mexico. Can we go to Paris, too? Sure. I'm gonna haul dirt, from my water well. Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo... [BARKING] It ought to be coming. Ooh, hey, let's have that, huh? I should drive him to school myself. Oh, no, Mom, please. Shun and I gotta go on the school bus with the other boys. [BUS HORN] Look, Shun... here it comes. ANNA: He'll be all right. Mr. Beck's a good driver. Come on, Shun. Bye, darling. Be careful. I will. Bye, Anna. Good bye, darling. There's your lunch. Have a good day. Come on, Mr. Pettigrew. No, no, no, he mustn't go. Why? Well, uh... he's not old enough yet. All right. You run along. Be good. Anna, do you think he... Oh, I know how you feel. It's silly. No... it'll always be this way for mothers. Seeing children off someplace... to grade school, high school, college... wedding trips... Your boy, Anna. Yes. And the war. We're always waiting, I guess. Bear a child, see them coming home from someplace. [BARKING] Hello, Mr. Pettigrew. Come on, Jim. Jim? Stay right at Pete's house till your mother comes. Yes, sir. Bye, Pete. Bye, Mr. Beck. Hi, Pete. Mother, this is Jim. He sits next to me. Hello, Jim. Hello. His mother's coming by for him. He lives in the Hollow. Oh, that's fine. How was school? Swell. Yeah. We played catch. Yeah. See? I skinned my knee. Yeah. Well, how did you like your teacher? Ah, the woman's silly. She keeps asking questions. Well, that's what she's there for. You'll learn the answers. But she keeps saying, shush. Oh, you mustn't talk in class. Well, I was answering. The teacher? No. Jim. You see, Jim has a dog, Mother. It's a terrier. Because it catches rats, and everything. Can I have Jim come to dinner Sunday? He won't spill milk. Of course you can. Do you think Shun would mind? Aw, that was a silly game. Jim's my friend now. [BARKING] Aren't you hungry, Pete? I guess not. Jim says spinach gives you muscles. But it doesn't taste good tonight. Jim and I drilled some more water wells, down to 350 feet. 350 feet, huh? Well, that's a lot of work, Mr. Hannigan. You bet. Gives you a stiff neck and a sore back. It hurts. Shouldn't try to work too hard. Sore muscles, eh? Yeah. Well, a little exercise takes the stiffness out sometimes. Try touching your chin to your chest. Don't feel good. You feel warm, darling. And you're tired. You better get your pajamas on, and turn in early, all right? All right. Mommy will be right in. Dan... Take it easy, honey. I'll call Dr. Blake. It could be a cold coming on. No. No, he doesn't act this way with a cold. I know. It's different. His neck. You go on in. I'll, I'll get on the phone. Brand new, huh? It's a beauty. [BELL TINKLES] A real bell, too. I'm gonna take it to the station, and race Mr. Smith. Well, now, I'd be willing to bet you'd beat him. You'll have to get rid of those sore muscles, though. Let's see about those. Ow. You know, I get a crick in my neck every once in a while. Ooh. It's no fun, is it? No. Well, let's look at those husky legs, too. Ooh. Mm. Ooh. Do a lot of running today? No. I drilled some more water wells. Do you suppose I could come over one of these days, and watch it? Sure. That's a date. I'll see you soon, Pete. Good night. [BELL TINKLES] Dan. Marjory. It's hard to tell you. It looks like polio. I can't be sure, until we get a spinal... But when? How? How could he get it? He only started school today. No, he'd have been exposed to it a couple of weeks ago. If he has it. But only four or five cases in the county. I want you to drive him in tonight. Uh, meet you in the village? No. I want him in the city, Dan. Farnsworth Hospital. I'll be waiting for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Do men have to go to the hospitals to rest? Sure. Lots of times. Did you bring my engine? Yes, darling. I left a note for Anna. ANNA (VOICEOVER): It'll always be this way for mothers. Seeing children off someplace... MARJORIE (VOICEOVER): The engine was all he wanted to take to the hospital. He clung to it, all during the five days. It meant everything to him. All of his dreams. He was holding it close in his arms while he was unconscious. It means more than ever to him now. We sit on the living room rug, and travel all over the world. He's the engineer. It's the only way he can get around for a while... until he walks again. We hope... we know... he will. Someday. [MUSIC PLAYING] [IN VOICEOVER - "QUEEN FOR A DAY" WISHES] I have seven children, so I would like a sewing machine. A doghouse, for my mother-in-law. An adding machine, for my [INAUDIBLE]. A long blanket, to cover both ends of my husband. I want... I want a refrigerator. My husband is an ice man in Warm Valley. I want a string of pearls, for my mother. She's a prospector. STUDIO CONTESTANT: I feel awful. JACK BAILEY: Why do you feel awful? I'm nervous. Oh, there's nothing in the world to be nervous about. No. There's just you, and I, and this little microphone, which is hooked up to the whole Mutual Network. Now, then, clear across the nation, are millions and millions of ears, listening. Just waiting for you to say the wrong thing. And you will. No, don't you worry about it. I'll tell you what. Come on over here with me, will you? Let's put you right over here. You'd better sit down, before you fall down. Here... just sit right down here, and we'll talk this whole thing over. There. Do you feel better? I don't think so. Now, can you tell me your name? Susan Blake. Well, Miss Blake, were you ever this nervous before in your life? Oh, no. No, I wasn't even this nervous the day I got married. Then I better ask you the questions while you can still talk. What would you like, if you're elected our "Queen for a Day?" Well, I'd like to have my husband stretched 3/16 of an inch. What was that again? I say, I'd like to have my husband stretched 3/16 of an inch. Why? You see, he put in an application to be a policeman. And he passed everything, all the tests. Only he's 3/16 of an inch too short. Oh, ho... So, well... well, if you could just have him stretched a little, so it would be 5' 9"? Just 3/16. Mrs. Blake, if you're elected our queen, we'll stretch your husband's neck, or whatever gives first. But believe me, Mrs. Blake, [INAUDIBLE] want to get stretched. Thank you, Ford. Now, let's introduce candidate number four. Well, say, the way you're clutching that thing, it looks like you gonna be frightened, too. No, no. You, you keep the ticket. You just tell me your name. Mrs. Nalawak. Mrs. Nalawak. Oh, that's, that's an interesting name. That's Polish, isn't it? Yes. I see. I was born in Warsaw. Uh-huh. But we live in America. Many, many years, now. Well, good. Then you're an American citizen. Yes. I see. Where do you live? We live in Torrance. Torrance? That's fine. What does Mr. Nalawak do? He is in the wire mill. To make the electric wire. Well, now, that's an important job. Do you have any children? We have one boy. Frank. Well, where's he? In school? No. For a long time, he was at the mill. To help us, with the money. But always, he dreams to go back to school. To learn. I want to help him. I would like for him the school that you give to some people on the radio. Oh, you mean that engineering school, in Chicago. Well, you want a scholarship for him, is that it? Yes. Please. Well, sure. If you're elected our queen, Mrs. Nalawak, that's exactly what we'll do. I wonder where he is? Maybe he's listening to us at home. No. But I will find him. You'll find him? Last night, he left home to work his way to find a school where he could go to study. Oh. Like you say. The engineering. But I do not know where he is. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYS] CARNIVAL BARKER: All right, folks, step right up and try your skills at the most enjoyable and educational game on the parkway. African Dodger, they call him. How about you, lad? You look like an athlete. Three shots for a quarter. Come right up here now, and try your skill. No, thanks. Hiya, Chunk. Hi, fellas. Hi, Rory. Having fun? See you at practice tomorrow. When do we get to Peoria? Peoria. I think two weeks before Dayton, the 16th... 2nd of September. Now, it only takes one hit to get one of these beautiful Kewpie dolls, hand-painted... Say... say... do you go anywhere near Chicago? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Anybody can win one of these... So look, if I bean this guy hard enough, can I have his job? Not a chance. He's my brother-in-law. These dolls are imported from Czechoslovakia... they're hand-painted, and imported from Czechoslovakia. Anybo... I'll make it good, anyway. Good. Try your luck now, son. And make it a bullseye. All right. Watch this, ladies and gentlemen. The boy is very good. Harry! Harry... are you all right? That was a beautiful turn, son. Here's your dolly. Come on, take another, friend. Take another one with you. And here's your quarter back. Good luck. Now, come on up, folks... this is a swell game. Everybody has a chance to win. One ball. Hit old iron...

Ladies and gentlemen, we offer you the ceremonial ritual of love. This artistic presentation has been handed down through the ages, even dating back to the days before the Egyptian primitives. Behold, behold, behold, the vestal virgins. These young ladies are prepared to perform for your edification. They have been trained in the art of the dance since childhood. And they come to us from the harem of the sultan, Aramee. All performed for your edification. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the show is just about to begin, and you don't want to miss any part of it. So step right into the tent with the little ladies. All right, girls, in you go. ANOTHER BARKER: Hurry, hurry, hurry... Only 25 cents. Hey, Miss... you want them? Would you like these? Thanks. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYS] [SHOUTS, APPLAUSE] DEACON McALLISTER: Ladies and gentlemen. You are about to witness the climax of the McAllister Carnival. This handsome figure of a man you see before you, will risk his life for your pleasure. He will mount this frail ladder, 110 perilous feet into the night sky. From that tiny platform, he will make his world famous, death-defying backward somersault, hurtling 110 feet, into a pool of... measure it, if you will... four shallow feet of water. I must ask for absolute silence. The slightest disturbance may affect his delicate balance, and send him crashing to his death. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Daredevil Renaldi. [APPLAUSE] [THE CROWD BOOS] Get up. Come on. I deeply regret your disappointment, but Daredevil Rinaldi has been taken ill. Daredevil Rinaldi has been taken drunk! [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYS] Deacon McAllister? Yeah? Do you want a diver? Who are you? Frank Nalawak. They call me Chunk. I live here. I can dive. So you live here. That doesn't do me any good. I want to work my way east. Come in. Sit down. This is Mrs. McAllister. Just an ordinary stiff. Now, Mrs. M. Tell me about yourself, Chunk. I know how to dive. I've taken somersaults off the rocks at the quarry. I wouldn't be scared to go up that ladder. Ha, ha... you think. Is it true you pay Rinaldi $50 a dive? Well, that's a might exaggerated. I can't pay any such figure as that. I'm just an every day, ordinary businessman. Well, how much do you pay? $25. For taking the chance of getting killed? That's a lot of money, son. A dead cow brings more than that. Go away, more. You suppose you could land in the tank, and stay in one piece? Heh. If you want a diver, I can do it. What's that quarry like? High rocks, and deep water. How high? The highest is 40 feet. Well, that's a lot different than 110. And deep water's a lot different than a tank with four. Getting paid's a lot different than doing it for nothing. No, I can't let you risk your neck, sonny. You, you ain't a professional. Don't be hasty, Mac. Now, Mrs. M, we can't let the young fellow hurt himself. Listen to me, will you? I'm not gonna hurt... How old are you? 21. You see? He ain't a minor. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a try out tomorrow morning. A few jumps down low, so I can see if you've got timing. Don't worry. You'll see it. It's a good chance, young man. We'd just as soon have you, if you're any good. Rinaldi ain't dependable. Every day, and bombed. Gives us a bad name. Be here at half past seven. Sure. Say... you got any place I can sleep tonight? Oh, it's that way, huh? Yeah. There's a mattress in the tent stake truck. Uh, right behind the trailer. Thanks. You had no right to quit. I've got the right every American's got. I worked there two years. Now, I'm going back to school. I'm gonna make something of myself. You go back tomorrow and get your job back. I'm not going back to work in that mill. I work in the mill. All right, you came from the old country. You didn't know the language. I come from a place where men are proud... because their hands are strong. To make things. To build. 30 years. Now I run the wire machine. That is making something of yourself. I don't want to make wire. I want to learn what goes through it. To use it. To make it work for me. Radar. Electronics. I want to get into engineering school. It costs money. I'll work my way. Your mother needs what you earn. I'm going to buy her things she never had before. If you stay in this home, and your mother cooks for you, you'll work for her. Now. Jump from 20, get the feel of the tank. Feet first. I'll do a swan. Not from there... you got to get balance. Ah... You're good, boy. How'd it feel? Feels like a bucket. It'll look like a thimble at 110. Now, go up to 30 feet. No higher. And go feet first. And don't get cocky. I know this racket. You'll sprain an ankle or something, unless you're taped. OK. Land with your legs bent, and take the shock with them. PEGGY: Hey, Deacon! Yeah? They want you on the phone, over at the grocery store. Who is it? The fire eater's in jail. Drunk? The riot squad. He was lighting brandy in his mouth, and blowing it at the dames. Oh, fine. Be right back. Come on down, and wait. Fire eating, I can't help you on. [WHISTLING] Hey, you. You've gotta have your legs taped above 30 feet. Not when you play football. [WHISTLING] You better wait, like the Deacon said. Uh-uh. I want to get a closer look at you. Goodbye, cruel world. [GASP] You're crazy. Aren't you? Sure. Do you know a guy got killed on that thing before Rinaldi took over? Don't get roped in, kid. Kid? I'm older than you. Yeah? How old? 21. Well, what do you want to join a carny for? It's a free ride to Chicago, and I can save for my tuition. Come again? Tuition. School. I'm going to study engineering. Well, I'll be sure and tell them. When they're scraping you up with a putty knife. You know, it... it's nice to have you worry about me. I like you. Well, you didn't seem to last night. You had your mouth open, like all the rest of those guys. You're much nicer looking right now, when you're not gawking. Thanks. You're welcome. Well, I'll see you around. Hey, what's your name? Peggy. Mine's Frank. Hi, Frank. [INAUDIBLE] need to give you a few pointers, if you don't let on you have the job permanently. Uh, just let him think it's for a couple of days, till he gets over his drunk. Sure. Ah... Open it. Come in. Come in. Well, how do you feel, Mr. Rinaldi? What are you doing around here? You part of death? You sucker a blowout. (LAUGHING)You're a card, Mr. Rinaldi. There's just a little matter of business I'd like to talk over with you this morning. Now, this is Frank Nalawak. He's going to take your place. Huh? Just for a couple of nights. Murderer. What are you doing? He's just a boy. What do you think? You think you make money, huh? You think you paper the inside of your trailer with dollar bills. You think you pull out a roll, and buy all the dirty little things your dirty little heart wants? You [INAUDIBLE]. You [INAUDIBLE]. Now, now, now, we don't want to excite you, Mr. Rinaldi. The young fellow won't get hurt, if you coach him a bit. He's done a lot of fancy diving. A fancy diver? Not even an acrobat? Ever been in a circus? Madman. Circus blood. Generations of circus blood. Ever hear of the Flying Rinaldis? No. Not even cultured. What does he know? What can he know? When I was less than a year old, I know more about timing than I know about walking. When I was four, I could do back bends, flip flops, handstands... backward and forward somersaults. I felt a little, little bit of a second, that means the difference between landing on your feet, or on your back. Blood. Blood. That's what it is. Blood. I don't know anything about that. I came here to talk business. My mother was a Hammerworth. Look. You're a nice young fellow. You got a big chest. Strong arms. Plenty muscles. Why would you want to break your neck? Mr. Rinaldi, if you'll wait a minute, I could... How does he know what it is like on top of a 110 foot ladder? Have you ever been up there? I will tell you. It's to be all alone up there. And all the little faces down on the ground, like little bugs, waiting to be squashed. They see you die. They hope. You even hope to die yourself. You say, push, just a little. A little, with your toes, when you leave the platform. Then you go over the tank, and ahh... ooh, hoo, hoo. You say, tip a little... tip a little this way, tip a little that way... Listen to me... why... I pity you. I pity you, from the bottom of my heart. Suppose you twist yourself for good? Suppose you bash your insides out, on the rim of the tank? Ahh... Ah, let the jerk break his neck if he wants to. It's a crummy way to live, anyway. What are you trying to keep it up for? Ah, nice feathers for my pretty bird... Feathers, my foot. Just take your $35 a dive... $35? He told me $25. $25 is all I'll pay. Take it, or leave it. Get out of here. Go on, get out... and take Junior with you. Go on, get out of my house! Boys... wait, wait... Hey, hey, wait, wait. I tell you one thing. When you're on your way down, and you have turned over, so your back is down... you understand? You think you want to turn your head to look. Don't. You twist, and hurt yourself. You think you want to bend, to make sure you turn over. Don't. If you do, you turn way over, and land flat, and bust yourself. All right. You can have the job. I'm through. I am gonna help you. $25... Here's $50 advance on your pay. I can trust you? Oh, sure. Be here tonight at 10:00. [BACKGROUND VOICES, APPROACHING] Hi, Chunk. Hi, Chunk. How you fixed? Hiya, Chunk. Where you been? What's the idea of missing practice? I can't play anymore, guys. I got a new job. What do you mean, a new job? Where? I'm going with the carnival. I'm diving. I got Daredevil Rinaldi's job. You mean, off that ladder? 110 feet? Yeah. Are you nuts? Hey, Ed... Those guys knock themselves off by the dozens. Not me. Ha, ha... you're kidding. Did you hear the news? No. Chunk's gonna dive off that ladder, at the carnival. Ah, quit kidding. I'm not. Brother. I hope he can bounce. Where do we send the flowers? To the carnival. CHUNK: Lay off, will you? Listen you guys. Eat dinner with me, will you? Dinner? Look... I got an advance. I'll fatten you at Tony's, huh? Hey... sirloin steak? Sure. Anything you want. Will you stick with me? Boy. You've got customers. And how. What do you keep looking at me for? It's a swell dinner, Chunk. Yeah. PEGGY (VOICEOVER): I'll be sure and tell them, when they're scraping you up with a putty knife. I'm not hungry. Let's drive down to the carnival. You know, it's a good idea not to eat too much anyway, just before you... [INAUDIBLE] Satchelbutt. Why don't you go pick a twig? Why? Here you are, Mister. Hey, fellas. Give this to my mother for me, will you? Yeah. Sure. Aw, gee, that's pretty. So you know, you ought to give it to her yourself. That is, if nothing happens... Aw, shut up, Satchelbutt. It's nothing like that. The carnival leaves tomorrow. And he's going with it. Yeah. That's right. Marissa? Marissa. MRS. KIMPEL: Is that you, Mr. Nalawak? Yes, Mrs. Kimpel? I told Mrs. Nalawak I'd watch the house for you. She said not to worry, she'd get home as soon as she could. She went to Los Angeles. Los Angeles? Why? Well, she didn't say. But I do hope she gets home in time so's you can take her to see Frank. My, how brave he must be. Frank? I'd be so proud, if he was my son. You don't know about him? No. Why, Mrs. McIlhenny just told me, coming back from the grocery store. She said Frank's gonna dive at the carnival tonight, off of that 110 foot ladder. It's so exciting. I do hope he won't hurt himself. I can't wait to see it. Oh, and Mr. Kimpel's just getting ready to go with me. We'll see you there. Marissa. Do I look nice for you? Jan? Marissa. I went to the radio program. To ask for help, for Frank. You are not angry. No. They made me the queen. Jan... all the ladies, they clapped their hands for me. And so many presents they are sending. They gave me paper for Frank to go to school. They will pay for him to study. Can we find him, Jan? Please? Maybe ask the bus people. He's working. He is at the carnival. Here? We will go and get him. Jan... you will let him come home? Yes. I want him to. Just so you can breathe. OK? Yeah. That stuff ought to fit you all right. Rinaldi used to wear it, but it shrunk in the laundry. Too tight? No. Don't want you to get hurt. Turn over. You remember everything Rinaldi told you? Yeah. Quit worrying. I'll be okay. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] Well, it's time. One for luck. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen. The McAllister Carnival takes pride in introducing, for its chief and extraordinary act of this evening, a talented, local young man. [CHEERS] In just a moment, this sturdy athlete will mount this 110 foot ladder, and risk his life for your pleasure. Hey, you know? That doesn't look like him. He's scared. Yeah. He will make his death-defying, backwards somersault, hurtling 110 feet into four... measure it, if you will... four shallow feet of water. I must ask for comp... I must ask for com... absolute silence. This... this is his first dive... his first... his first bout with death... [INAUDIBLE]. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your friend, your home town boy, Frank Nalawak! [CHEERS] Good luck, Chunk! Yeah. Jan... where is he? Is that him? No! Not from so high! Frank! Frank! Frank! [CARNIVAL MUSIC CONTINUES] Oh! Jump! You scared? Shut up. Come on, jump... what are you waiting for? CHUNK (VOICEOVER): I can do it. RINALDI (VOICEOVER): You even hope you die yourself. Don't turn your head to look. RINALDI (VOICEOVER): Suppose you bash your insides out on the rim of the tank? Don't bend on the way down. RINALDI (VOICEOVER): Blood. Blood. [CHEERS] [INAUDIBLE]. Frank... Frank... Frank. Frank. Please. Come home. Your mother won a school for you. [CALLIOPE PLAYS] Well, your name, please? Uh, Mrs. Jeanette Leiter. A ha. Where were you and Mr. Leiter married? In Jefferson City, Missouri. Oh, you met him there? No. When I met him, he was a salesman in a man's clothing store. Ooh. Well, what was you doing in a men's clothing store? Well, I had gone to school with him, and, finally, we were married. You know how it is. Maybe so. Look, what, what would you like if you're elected our queen, Mrs. Leiter? Well, I'm a mentalist. What? A mentalist. You're a mentalist? Uh-huh. With my husband's magic act. Oh. And while he was in the service, he lost all of his magic. Uh, yes? His magical equipment. Oh, yes. And so I'd like to take him through a magic shop, and let him get some new equipment. Well, what would you call it? Oh, it doesn't matter. All I want to know is, what would you like if you're elected our queen? Some new illusions and tricks for my husband. Well... Oh... just a minute. If she's elected our queen, you'll get some new tricks and illusions for her husband. What do you think? Oh, I'm so excited about that dance tonight. Me, too. I'm going with Bill. Yeah, what are you going to wear? Oh, I guess I'll wear my blue dress. That's his favorite. Oh! AUDIENCE MEMBER: Wasn't it a wonderful show? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oh, yes. I told friend Fred he can join us for something to eat. Good. I hate eating alone. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TELEPHONE RINGS] Hello? Miss Wilmarth? Good evening. Are you free to accept a case? Oh, yes, I am. We have a newborn leaving the hospital tomorrow. Will you take it? Oh, yes, I'd, I'd love to. Mrs. Owen Cruger. Room 482. Leaving tomorrow afternoon. I'll be there. Oh... thank you. Thank you, very much. Now, if we can get them to raise their advertising budget to a million and a half, we'll put them on Transcontinental. We'll base the whole campaign on beauty. Delicate, exquisite, fragile feminine beauty. It sells. Women buy it. That 7:30 time slot's still open. We, uh, we ought to grab it. Right. Now, there are a few things here we ought to clear up, before I go in... Oh, Mr. Cruger... Yes? Your home called. Mrs. Cruger and the baby have arrived. Good. I'm on my way. Imagine me, driving home every evening to that dream girl, and that little doll. Ha, ha! You old bachelors. Work on that account for me, chums. I've got another mouth to feed. Caviar. [MUSIC PLAYING] Owen, darling. Camilla. Wonderful, having you home. Oh, it's so wonderful to be here. Oh, that horrible mattress in the hospital felt like cast iron. Did the trip home tire you? No. Do I look tired? Of course not, darling. You look lovely. Really? Yes. Rosemary and Jane were at the hospital this morning. Oh, were they? Their voices were almost hushed. They said there was a new look in my eyes. A look of motherhood. They're right, darling. There is. You brought me some flowers. Your favorites. The baby corsage, for Jessica. Oh, darling... the doctor says she can't have flowers in her room. They breathe oxygen, or... something. Oh. Well, I suppose they do. Oh, how beautiful. And the nosegay. You're so thoughtful. Will you ring, darling? Yes, of course. Now, I'll have her put in water right away, and keep it here, where Jessica can look at it. Can babies see things? Oh, of course not, darling. Oh, she was so wonderful on the way home. Trying to look at everything. Her eyes were so wide, and so blue. Oh, Miss Wilmarth. Will you put these... oh, Owen... this is Jessica's nurse. Miss Wilmarth, Mr. Cruger. How do you do, Mr. Cruger? How do you do? Oh. Oh, they're darling. Ooh... they're bootiful. Oh. CAMILLA: Aren't they lovely? Please arrange them in vases. The nosegay, in the little cloisonne one. Oh. Oh, yes, I shall. Right away. Oh... excuse me, Mr. Cruger. Ha, ha, ha. Yes. Of course. It's unbelievable. What? Well, that... that, that... face. How could anyone look like that? Why, she looks like... well, I don't know. Who is she? What happened to that nurse we arranged for? Miss Barnes? Oh, darling, I forgot to tell you. She can't come for three weeks. She had to fly to Chicago. Her mother was ill, or... something. Three weeks? You mean, this one's going to... Well, of course, darling. Oh, we're so lucky to have her. Why, Dr. Markinson says she's one of the finest baby nurses in the city. And the last moment, too. Well, if Dr. Markinson says... a horse. That's what she looks like. Just the way they look at you over a fence. Long, bony, melancholy... a horse. Oh, darling, I hope you don't disapprove. It upsets me so. Oh, no, sweet. It's all right. Horses are friendly. Yeah. Oop. Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I don't quite know my way around yet. Oh... Oh, I am sorry, Mrs. Biggs. Huh. It's all right. My goodness. We are a little crowded, aren't we? Yeah. Mm-hm. Well, I guess we nurses, and baby bottles, and... heh, mm-hm... diapers... do, sort of, upset the routine a little. Just at first. At first, she says. Oh, when you've gone through 50 of them, you can take it. Wait till you step on a stray baby bottle, if you want to get upset. Good evening, Mary. Oh, good evening, sir. The baby's just beautiful, Mr. Cruger. Yes, isn't she? And she's got a hungry father, too. What are we having for dinner tonight? Broiled steak. Steak? Good. Good. Uh, Mrs. Cruger's not dining. Heh... no. It's for that one. The nurse? Well... well, doesn't she want to eat with you all, and talk about the baby and everything? Well, Mary... you know what they say... better late than... oh, Mr. Cruger. Oh, how nice. Yes, yes, yes, isn't it? Mercy, my goodness mercy, I had no idea it was that late. Well, don't you blame me, Mr. Cruger. Don't you scold me. You'll just have to blame that young daughter of yours. She eats a lot, and keeps us all busy around here. Yes. I'm sure she does. But you wait, just you wait. You're the one that's going to be kept busy, when those beaus start coming around. You'll see. That young lady is going to be a heartbreaker, if ever I saw one. Well. That's nice to hear. That'll be the day, won't it? Yes, indeedy. Well, how did the patients do on the trip home from the hospital? Oh, they were perfect doves. They both [SNIFF] drank in the fresh air. That's good. The baby gained two whole ounces today. Did she? That's fine. She's going to be a grown girl before we know it. Yeah, that's right, before we know it. Well. Steak. Oh. I just adore steak. Don't you, Mr. Cruger? Oh, yes, I do indeed. It's so nourishing. Yes, 'tis. -We'll have to give Mrs. Cruger lots of steak. She'll gain strength so rapidly. Yes, yes, she will. Proteins, you know. Yes, yes. Proteins. She'll be up and about before we know it. Yes. Up and about before... yes, she certainly will. [MUSIC - INSTRUMENTAL - "THE OLD GRAY MARE"] CAMILLA: Hello, darling. How was your steak? Steak? Heh, heh, heh... it certainly was. Oh, steak. Darling, do I have to have this every night? -Steak? Why... No, no, no, no. Miss... what's-her-name. Does she have to eat with me? Oh, of course. They're nurses, darling. They feel they're part of the family. Oh, you couldn't treat her as a servant... why, it would offend her terribly. But... You don't really mind, do you, dear? She's very kind. Mm... And she can always tell you how Jessica's doing. She can, and she did. It isn't that, but... well, I just can't look at her. I keep expecting her to toss her head and whinny. Oh, no... Oh, don't misunderstand me, darling. I love horses. I'm a fool for a horse. A horse is a noble animal, darling. All I say is, that nobody has any business going around looking like a horse, and behaving as if it were all right. You don't catch horses going around looking like people, do you? (LAUGHING)Oh, I know how you do love to exaggerate. Well, it isn't that I... you know... Bed time. Ah, ha. Well... you ate a good dinner, Mrs. Cruger. Didn't she, Mr. Cruger? Yes, indeedy. Well, that's just fine. Now, you've had a big, exciting day, so we'll just get you all ready for bed. And tuck you in, for a good rest. Oh. If you'll excuse us, Mr. Cruger, but this is the ladies' little time. Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah. Well, uh, I'll be in later, dear. To say good night. Heh, heh, heh... Mr. Cruger is so nice. Yes, isn't he? [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. It's you, Mr. Cruger. She's in here. Oh. It's Daddy. Daddy's come to see you, pretty girl. Yes. Wave to doody Daddy, and give a big smile smile. Her is all comfy now. Her just had a little wet, wet. Oh. Did she? Well. Does her want to give her dadums a great big kiss? Now, hold her tight, dadums. [BABY CRIES] Rock-a-bye... She's crying. [INAUDIBLE]. Her just didn't recognize her big, strong dadums. It takes a itty bitty time to get used to daddies. Say, night, night, dadums. Night, night. I mean, good night, Jessica. 27th... 15 days more. Ohh. I beg your pardon? Huh? Oh, oh. Oh. Where was I? "We will take up the contact with Gresham the day you arrive." Oh, yeah. Eh, uh, looking forward to seeing you soon, best regards. That's all for tonight. Thanks very much. Ohh. The flowers are outside. Flowers? Oh, oh, yes, yes, yes, thank you. Good night. Good night, Mr. Cruger. [MUSIC PLAYING] CAMILLA: Sweet. You look upset. I am upset. Does that woman ever go out? Doesn't our horsie ever rate a night off? Well, where would she want to go? Well, she might take herself a moonlight canter around the park. [SHE LAUGHS] Oh, she doubtlessly gets a much greater thrill out of dining with you. After all, you're a man. And she can't have seen many. Poor old horsie. She's not a bad soul. Yes. What a round of pleasure it is for me, having dinner with "not a bad soul." Heaven help me, every time she asks for a lump of sugar, I start holding it out to her on my palm. Well, what makes you think I'm caught in any world of gaiety, lying here? Oh, darling. My poor darling. I didn't mean it... honest I didn't. How can I complain, after all you've been through? And I haven't done a thing. Please, sweetheart, you know I didn't mean it. After all, you just have her at dinner. I have her around all day. Please, sweetheart, you poor angel. To-do. The bootiful girl has come to say night-night to her momsie. Doodle oo... a ha... Ah, Daddy, look... izzy whoo hoo... izzy, wizzy, wizzy, whoo hoo. See, all the tears is done, now. Yes. Say night-night, dadums. Us go teepy bye now. Night-night, momsie. Good night, useless. Mm hm. That's the girl. Night-night, momsie. If that child ever calls you momsie, I'll turn her out in the snow. [INTERPOSING VOICES]... Oh. Please, go ahead. No, no, Miss Wilmarth, you go ahead. But you started. No, no, no, I wasn't going to say anything at all, really. Oh, but you were. Please. Well, I was just going to ask, uh, you work so very hard, uh, don't you ever go out in the evenings? Oh, mercy no. Not when I'm on a case. Oh. Just between cases. Mm. Mm. Yes, then I... then I really have a little frolic. Frolic? Oh, really? That's very interesting. Just how do you frolic? Well, I often go to the ladies' radio shows, you know, like, "Queen for a Day?" Queen... oh, yes. You might become a queen, huh? Oh, well, not really, I... I just enjoy the company of the other ladies. We have a, a little queen of our own right here, don't we? Oh, yes, yes, we certainly do. [INAUDIBLE] see the show on television for the first time, just before I came here. Oh, really? Mm. It was wonderful. But it's very hard to get tickets. Oh. I can get you tickets, any time. Can you? Oh, that would be so kind of you. Perhaps tomorrow night? Oh, no, I... I couldn't possibly leave our patients. Oh. I see... yes, that's right. Perhaps after I leave, uh... would that be possible? Oh, yes. Mm. Oh, that will be so exciting. Yes, it certainly will. I'll be so grateful. So will I... I, I, I'll certainly get them for you. Good evening, Miss Wilmarth. Well... how were the patients all day? That's good, that's fine. Mrs. Cruger seems to be getting stronger every day, doesn't she? That's good, that's fine. Yes, up and about before we know it... yes, she certainly will. Mm. Hm? Oh, yes, yes, we certainly have had a mild winter. I see where they held up that, uh, jeweler's shop in broad daylight. Yes, I certainly don't know what we're coming to. I see the cat. Do you see the cat? The cat is on the mat. Yes, it certainly is. Pardon me, Miss Wilmarth, but must you look so much like a horse? And do you like to look like a horse, Miss Wilmarth? Heh, heh, that's good, Miss Wilmarth, that's fine. Oh, yes, yes, you certainly do. Will you, for heaven's sake, finish your oats, Miss Wilmarth, and let me get out of this? Jack. I've heard of advertising ulcers, heart attack, and shock, but this is a new one. Catch Freddy before he leaves... you've got to come to dinner. Both of you. I've got to have somebody to talk to. - Tonight? - Yes, tonight. Now, hurry up and get him. You've got to come. (UNISON)I was strolling through the park one day... Bang, bang... Back on your downie cap. Oh. Yes, that's enough exercise for the little mother. Oh, you both are adorable escorts. Aren't they, Owen? Yes, and we make, uh, beautiful nurses, too. You think so? Wait till you see our "Seabiscuit." Miss Wilmarth? Sh, sh, sh... Oh. Good evening. I, uh, I didn't know the door was open. Mm-hm. I mean, uh, I hope we, uh, haven't been disturbing you. Oh, goodness, not the least little bit. Mercy. Oh. Uh, I, uh... we were wondering if you wouldn't like a cocktail? Oh... mercy. Why, thank you ever so much, Mr. Cruger. Well, see you at dinner. Yes. Eh, thank you. Well, I'm the one that ought to thank you, for the lovely little cocktail. Oh, well... OWEN:... you never know about these things, you know? That course wasn't made for golfers. They built it for mountain goats. [LAUGHTER] You ought to try Pebble Beach, driving across that ocean inlet. Why, it's murder, if you have a... Oh, Mr. Cruger, I... oh, my. Oh, Mr. Cruger. Oh, Mr. Cruger, I'm so sorry. But at the last minute, our little precious had to... Uh, uh, yes, yes, yes, yes, I know, it's very [INAUDIBLE]. Miss Wilmarth, this is Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Forster. Oh. I'm pleased to meet you. How do you do? I'm pleased to meet you, too. How do you do? Oh, uh, Mary, let's have the champagne now. (LAUGHING)That's a good idea. Well? Well... Well, uh... getting much warmer out, isn't it? Yes. Notice it? Uh, yes, yes, it's just, uh... well, we're about due for warm weather. Yes. We should expect it. Any day, now. Oh, it'll be here. It'll come. I love spring. I just love it. Darn good time of year. Certainly is. Eh, good for flowers. Flowers? [FORCED LAUGHTER] Yes, flowers. Well. Here's a health, everybody. Health. Health. Health. Health. Well, your patients seem to be getting along pretty well, Miss Wilmarth, don't they? I should say they are. And they're pretty nice patients, too, aren't they, Mr. Cruger? Yes, yes, yes, that they are, that's right. They certainly are, that's right. Well, uh, you must meet all sorts of people in your work, I suppose. Must be pretty interesting. Sometimes it is. It all depends on the people. That's right. Everything depends on the people, doesn't it? Always does. Uh, wonderful, the way this country's come right up in medicine, isn't it? Mm. Yes, it is. Um, I see where they, uh, think they've got a new cure for arthritis. Oh, have they really? HEWITT: Wonderful thing. Wonderfully interesting. Let's have some brandy. Now. Great idea. Wonderful. I've never drunk brandy. Oh. OWEN (SINGING):... mare, she ain't what she used to be, ain't what she used to be, ain't... At last. Good night, Miss King. Have a wonderful evening. Good night. Thank you, Mr. Cruger. [HE WHISTLES "CALL TO THE POST"] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING)Oh, the old gray mare, she ain't what she used to be, ain't what she used to be, ain't what she used to be, the old gray mare, she ain't what she used to be, many long years a... Oh, uh, Ralph... Miss Wilmarth's leaving. You're driving her home. RALPH: Yes, sir. Many long years ago. Oh, darling, how could you? You know I simply loathe gardenias. Gardenias? Why, I ordered your favorite orchids. Florist must have got the boxes mixed. I'll talk to him about it. I'm sorry, sweet. Mm, you're forgiven, darling. You've made such a perfect choice of flowers every night. All these weeks. All these weeks is right. Do you realize that you're having dinner with me tonight? Hm? That I'll have you with me again? That I'll be able to look across the table and see you sitting there, so beautiful? And hear your voice? Pardon us, Miss Wilmarth. Oh... oh, excuse me. Oh, you're home, Mr. Cruger, I... I hoped I'd have a chance to say goodbye to you, too. Oh, yes. Of course. Well, uh, Miss Barnes and our precious are just getting on famously. They're... they're all organized, so I guess the hour of parting has come. Oh, we're very sorry to lose you, Miss Wilmarth. Yes, we are, indeed. I have the car waiting to take you home. Oh. That's so nice of you, Mr. Cruger, you... you're so thoughtful. Well, I... uh... oh, uh... these are for you, Miss Wilmarth. For me? Oh, Mr. Cruger, really, I... oh, really, Mr. Cruger, you... you shouldn't have done it. Really, you shouldn't have. Oh, well, it's nothing... I never in my li... oh. Goodness, mercy. I never saw anything so lovely in all my life... did you, Mrs. Cruger? I just don't how to begin to thank you. Oh, well, then, don't... I just adore them. Oh, they are nice ones. Put them on, Miss Wilmarth. Oh, no, I... I don't think I'll wear them, I... I think I'll just take them home in the box, like this, it's such a nice box, I'd like to have it, I'd... like to keep it. Why, of course. Well, I... I never was on a pleasanter case. I've just had the time of my life, though. Oh, I... I just can't stop looking at my posies, they're so lovely. I can't thank you enough for everything you've done. Well, we ought to thank you, Miss Wilmarth. We really ought. I just hate to say goodbye, I... just hate it. Oh, don't say it. Why, I never dream of saying it. And remember, you must stop in and see the baby, any time you can. Yes, you certainly must, that's right. Yes, I will. I'll take your bag down for you, Miss Wilmarth. Thank you. I'll go down and back her into the car. That'll finish it. Wee... Well. There we are. Have you got everything? Yes, I have. Oh... the tickets. I forgot the tickets that I promised you, about the television show. How wonderful. They're for tomorrow night. Yes. Now that you've finished working so hard, you can have your little, eh... frolic. I shall. Uh, well, good luck again, Miss Wilmarth. And don't forget us. No, I won't, I... I won't ever do that. Is there anything wrong, Miss Wilmarth? Oh, no, it's... it's just that it's the first time in my whole life that a man ever gave me flowers. Oh, Jessica, you're going to be as beautiful as your mother. How was she today, Miss Barnes? Just fine. Dr. Markinson was here at 4:00. He said she's doing perfectly... to continue the formula. Oh, that's fine. Good night to Mother, Jessica. Good night, charming one. And your father. Good night, doll. Isn't Miss Barnes wonderful? She talks English. Not even one googly-goo. Oh, she's ideal. Oh, darling, I'm tired of this symphony. Oh, I'm sorry, sweet. What would you like to hear... Horsie. Well, what about her? Well, those tickets I gave her. This is her night to frolic. What? I don't know what, but it ought to be a cataclysm. FORD (TV): Well, in addition to the bathing suit and all the vacation wardrobe... We'll never find her in that crowd. FORD (TV):... three week, fully paid vacation tour of that Pacific paradise, Honolulu. JACK BAILEY (TV): Now, for our third candidate, a lady that was so frightened, I didn't think she was gonna get up here today at all. Wake up... it's, it's Horsie. A contestant. Oh, ho, ho. This... ho, ho... MISS WILMARTH (TV): Miss Ella Wilmarth. JACK BAILEY (TV): Miss Wilmarth? MISS WILMARTH (TV): Yes. JACK BAILEY (TV): Say, you were pretty excited about getting up here today, weren't you? MISS WILMARTH (TV): Mercy. I just can't believe it, I... I've been to your show so many times, but I... I never thought that I'd... JACK BAILEY (TV): That you'd get up here? MISS WILMARTH (TV): Well. JACK BAILEY (TV): Well, you're up here, but you pretty near didn't make it. That's fine. Now, tell me, what do you do? I'm an infant nurse. Oh. You take care of the, the little ones, uh, in the hospitals? Sometimes. When they need me. But mostly, I go home with the newborn babies. Oh, well, you're, you're kind of a specialist, then. Yes. Yeah, well, how long have you been doing this? 30 years. 30 years. Well, that's wonderful. My goodness. Say, about that... about how many of these little folks have you taken home, in all this length of time? I just finished taking care of my 311th baby. 311. Well, that's just wonderful. How about that? Oh, gee, that, that's really great. Say... for 30 years, you've been wondering what these little folks would like. What, what would you like, if you're elected our queen? I'd like an electric razor. JACK BAILEY (TV): An electric razor? Oh, now don't tell me those little babies shave at that age. MISS WILMARTH (TV): I know it sounds silly, but it's the only thing I can think of to ask that Mr. Cruger would like. JACK BAILEY (TV): Uh... Mr. Cruger? MISS WILMARTH (TV): It was their baby I just finished taking care of, and he was the nicest and kindest man I ever worked for, in my whole life. I'd like to give him a present, so that he'd know how much his kindness meant to me. JACK BAILEY (TV): Well, don't you worry. If you're elected our queen, we'll see that you get that electric razor. You betcha. How about that? And now it's up to you folks in the audience to decide which of these ladies is going to be tonight's queen. Now, the finalists are number one and number three. Number one is Mrs. Ames, who wants to go to Denver, to see her mother. And number three is Mrs... uh, I beg your pardon... Miss Wilmarth, who wants an electric razor. Now, in the order they came to the microphone, don't whistle or shout, simply applaud. Here we go. Your applause for number one, Mrs. Ames. [APPLAUSE] Thank you. And now, your applause for number three, Miss Wilmarth. [APPLAUSE] Come on... all right. Now you come on back here. Did you hear that applause? Now, you're really the Queen, and we're gonna get you all fixed. Right there is the crimson and velvet and ermine robe. Fix her up. Take her right up there on her own throne, and this is going to be a real thrill. There... that's right. Sit right down, Your Majesty. There's your sterling silver scepter, and four dozen beautiful red roses. And now, for the most thrilling moment of all, I crown you, Queen Ella... "Queen for a Day!" [APPLAUSE] JACK BAILEY (TV): And now, first, here's that electric razor that you wanted, for that man who's been so kind to you, and I certainly want you know that's the finest electric razor you can get. Sure. I hope it makes him very happy. And now, do you know what we're gonna do for you? Next week, you're going out to the International Airport, you're going to board a luxury liner, and we're going to fly you across the blue Pacific, right straight to Honolulu. And you'll need a whole batch of airplane tickets to do that, so here they are. And you're going to need a, a hat box or something, to carry all your wardrobe in. So just look at this. Here is your beautiful luggage now. Yes. Here come the page girls, with a brand new set of luggage, for you to use on your trip to Honolulu. Well, now we've got to have something to put in this luggage, so Your Majesty, here is your new wardrobe. Look. Now, Your Majesty, when you get back from that dream trip to Honolulu, you'll want someplace to dream in. We have for you a one year lease, on an apartment overlooking all of Hollywood. And here's the key. Now, it's an unfurnished apartment, but wait till you see what we've done about that. Hold onto your crown, Your Majesty. Here's the way it will be. [MUSIC PLAYING]
