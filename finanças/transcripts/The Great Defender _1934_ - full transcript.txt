- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes And lastly, members of the jury, I ask you to put yourselves in the position of the accused. To consider the ghastly life... ...which this poor creature in the dock has been compelled to lead. Deceived, betrayed, her whole life ruined. A child's future jeopardized, all the years of sacrifice and loving care... ...smashed to pieces. And by whom? By a man so vile, so beastly... Milord, I must object again. Sir Douglas, I have already excluded that evidence. Milord, this woman's life hangs in the balance. I cannot accept your ruling. I'm afraid you'll have to accept it, Sir Douglas. Very well, Milord. Members of the jury, I am compelled to ask your indulgence for these interruptions. It is difficult to plead when one is continually hampered and obstructed... Sir Douglas! I will not allow you to pass remarks like that to the jury. Allow it or not, Milord, it's the truth. Sir Douglas, if you persist in your defiance of the bench, I shall have to order you to sit down. It's a merciful thing, Milord, that the fate of the prisoner lies with the jury. Sit down! As Your Lordship pleases. I can plead just as well in this position. Members of the jury, the fate of the prisoner lies in your hands. I will say no more. Gosh, I never thought Rolls could win that case. Oh, we usually get an acquittal. Of course, you've never seen him before. It was an awkward moment there when he dropped his papers all over the floor. Would have been more awkward if he hadn't. - What do you mean? - Oh, very simple. Witness gets stumped for an answer, bang go papers, confusion in court, witness has time to think. He... he did it on purpose? Oh, yes, he's got a dozen tricks like that. Gosh, he is marvelous. I don't know how he dares talk to the judge like that. Trick number two. Counsel gets judge's back up, judge loses temper, sympathetic jury think counsel will quit it, acquittal. That's what we call good jury work, my boy. In fact very... Good jury work, my dear Rolls. But I do think you went a bit far with the judge. - Jurors give verdicts, not judges. - You're telling me? But if you keep getting up against the judges, you'll frighten away rich clients. My dear old chap, I'd rather save some poor innocent devil from your clutches for nothing... ...than have a thousand guineas' brief. Hm, very noble sentiment. But that won't pay your overdraft. Well, if all else fails, I can always become a prosecutor like yourself. No, no, my friend, you have too much conscience for that. - Your tea, Sir Douglas. - Oh, thank you. Where's the red pepper, Pope? I beg your pardon, sir, but didn't Dr. Hackett... ...advise you not to be over-indulgent in red pepper with your buttered toast? Hackett's an old woman. I see in the papers there's been another little spot of bother in court, sir. The papers don't do justice, Pope. We had a magnificent row. You ought to have been there. Oh, I wish I had been. What's the matter, sir, isn't the tea to your liking? It... it was very hot in court today. I'm not feeling... good, Pope. Possibly the little spot of bother, sir. Oh, no, nothing of the kind, just a bit off color. I think I'll go for a stroll. Shall I phone Dr. Hackett, sir? - What ever for? - To tell him you may be calling on him. How are you, nurse? I hope I'm not late. This way, sir. - Excuse me. - Certainly. I'm going to prescribe something for you. It will at least make certain you have a good night's rest. I hope so. Take one when going to be with a little hot milk. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Will you follow me, sir? Sir Douglas Rolls, sir. - Hello, Hackett. - Hello, Rolls. - Wasn't that Mrs. Locke, the artist's wife? - That's right. I thought so, I saw her at a private view of his pictures a short while ago. I'm told he's likely to be in the next honor's list. - He's done some good work. - Oh, he has. Sit down. Thank you. I'm sorry to hear you're not so well. Oh, I don't think it's much, I get a sort of a cramp here occasionally. Get on that couch and I'll run a tape over you. Well, what's the verdict? Now put that cigarette away and listen to me. You know? You take your cases too much to heart. You wear yourself out. When a poor devil's life is hanging in a balance. Yes, yes, but you must take things easy now. Go for a long sea voyage around the world. That takes time. My practice is liable to disappear. That's my advice to you, my dear Rolls. Supposing I don't take your advice... ...and I have to fight a case tomorrow? Would I be able to abstain the course. It's difficult to say. - Are you sure this trip is necessary? - Definitely. All right, Phyllis, that'll do for today, thank you. I don't like the idea of every Tom, Dick and Harry staring at you like that. Even on canvas. Don't be silly, darling, you talk like Eric. Eric? Who's Eric? Only a friend, nobody you know. Oh, just a kid who doesn't approve of all this. Nobody I know? But you seem to know him pretty well. Oh, darling, must we go through all this jealousy business again? - Any telephone messages, Agnes? - No, ma'am. Send this to the chemist and get it made out. Yes, ma'am. Laura! Well... don't look at me like that. I told you to be careful. I think it might be better if I don't come around to your flat tonight. I'll be out anyway. I'm spending the night at Mother's. I'm meeting her this afternoon. All right. I'll see you here tomorrow at the usual time. - I can't stand it any longer. - I've told you I meant nothing by it. Nothing, please believe me. I can only believe my eyes. Oh, my dear Lord, all models expect a little attention. - And get it, which is more than I do. - You know perfectly well... I know perfectly well that ever since she came here you've shown me no consideration. You've done nothing but neglect me and flaunt that creature in my face. I am your wife, you know. I'm quite aware of the fact. Then stop humiliating me. How do you suppose I feel? Wherever I go my friends smiling and whispering behind my back. Can I help it if these friends of yours are a lot of evil-minded busybodies? Yes! By not giving them cause to gossip. By giving up this woman. By being a decent husband. Ou, you want me to be a smug little pram-pushing suburbanite. Well I can't and I won't! I'm not asking you to change. I only want you to be the man you were. The man I married. The man I once loved. And would love again. If being a model husband means I've got to submerge myself, dance attendance on you, give up my friends because they happen to be attractive, and become a contemptible businessman without an artistic idea in his head, you can count me out! I'm through with it. As to the future, I'm not going to stick in the power substation for the rest of my life. I should hope not. You'd still care for me, wouldn't you, dear, even if I didn't make a lot of money. Of course. But you are going to, aren't you? Well, I showed my model of the miniature dynamo to the chief last night... ...and he said I ought to make a fortune out of it. A fortune? Oh, darling, how wonderful! All I want is enough to get married. Then you can chuck that rotten job of yours. Really, Eric, things are not nearly as bad as you make out. Why, they think no more of the nude than you do of a lamppost. Well, you know as it says in the Bible, "Know you not that your body is a temple?" Does the Bible say that? "If any man should defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy." Oh, funny idea, comparing our bodies to temples and things like that. Don't, dear, we are like that. If you keep staring out like that, you'll frighten Eric's girl away. I suppose it isn't natural for a mother... ...to want to see her future daughter-in-law for the first time. A lot more natural to want to see her for the last time. You make a joke like that at supper, John, and you'll hear from me. Well, I was only trying to... That's the trouble with you, you're always trying. Very. Here they are. Put your coat on. And for goodness' sake, do behave. And don't forget the moscatel. What? At three and six a bottle? Oh... Perhaps she doesn't drink. - John! - Oh, all right. - Mother, Dad. this is Phyllis. - How do you do? I'm so glad to meet you, dear. - What about one for the old man? - Why not? Why not indeed. - Oy! - John! - Why don't you take your hat off, dear? - Oh, thank you I've heard so much about you, Phyllis. You don't mind me calling you Phyllis, do you? Oh, please do, Mrs. Hammond. No telling what she'll call you after she's your mother-in-law, eh? Don't mind him, darling, he doesn't mean any harm. No? Don't I, now? Why do you suppose I ply young women with a strong drink, hm? - Moscatel, my dear? - Thank you. - What about you, Eric? - You know I don't drink, Dad. Ah, yes, but this is a special occasion. He doesn't get engaged to a pretty girl every day, does he? I hope not. - Come on, Eric. - No, really, Dad. Al right, all the more for us. What about supper? I've got to go to work, you know. Come along, Phyllis, you come and sit here. Come on, everybody, everybody, sit down. Sit down? I never heard of such a thing. Nonsense. Young ladies should be toasted standing, shouldn't they, Phyllis? Oh, I don't know, I've never been toasted. Well, anyway, here's to the loving couple. And may all their troubles be little ones. The fellow who said that's been dead for centuries. Oh, go on! I heard it on the wireless last night. - Ah, let's have a tune. - Yes, sir. Music at mealtimes, that's the thing. All right, John, turn it on. And here are stock prices supplied by the... Quick, Gertie, my green evening dress. Have a nice supper at Mr. Eric's? Oh, I wish the wine had been as old as Father Hammon's jokes. I suppose Mr. Eric wouldn't come up just now because he didn't think it proper. I didn't give him the chance. I dropped him at the power station. What they don't know won't hurt them, I always say. No need for him to know you was going out with Mr. Alfred. That's him. No mistaking that serenade. Well, don't stand there talking. Where's my cape and gloves? - Oh, get a move on. - Get a move on, I like that. I'm in a hurry myself. My young man's waiting for me. He's taking me to the pictures. You needn't get here so early in the morning then. Oh, thank you, miss. Oh, I say, my dear, what a lovely dress. I hope you're still sending someone to pay the bills. Good morning, darling. - Have a good time at your mother's? - Not too bad. - You met her all right, then? - Of course. Does she always wear trousers? - What are you talking about? - You know damn well what I'm talking about. - That little twirp who was waiting for you. - Eric's not a twirp! He's an electrical engineer, and a very clever one too. He knows all about volts, and amperes and... Well, and amperes and things like that. Really, I can hardly wait to meet him. You needn't be so snooty about it. Well, at least it appears we have one thing in common. At any rate, he respects me. Oh, he has a sense of humor too. He has a sense of decency. He has principles and he wants to marry me. - Marry you? - What's funny in that? Well, seriously, Phyllis, you're not thinking of marrying this stuffy electrician. Why, you couldn't love a man like that. I didn't say I loved him, but I'm very fond of him. Why shouldn't I marry? After all I... I'm not getting any younger. And I want some sort of security like anyone else. You're quite right, my dear. And I'll be only too glad to help you. Why, I'll... I'll give him that picture as a wedding present. I'll even throw work in his way... ...if I have any broken doorbells, or electric irons... - Funny, aren't you? - All right, go ahead, marry him. - Make your bid for security. - Oh, darling, you don't... But don't imagine you can keep me into the bargain. What about finishing the picture? I'm finished with the picture and I'm finished with you, get out. Get out! What do you take me for, anyway? I won't have it, you understand? I won't stand for it! Do you think I am a fool? Trade me over for some grimy cockney in overalls? A greasy little mechanic? If you think I'm going to give you up for a thing like him, you're very much mistaken. Leslie, please listen. I've been trying to tell you, he's not an ordinary electrician. He works at the power station. - Well, what of it? - He's in charge of the night shift. - Well? - Oh, darling, he works at night. So you said, but... Oh... well, why didn't you tell me before? You didn't give me the chance. Come on, darling, let's get on with the painting. Modern education's all wrong. Greek, Latin and geometry are hardly modern. That's my point. They should teach ??? at the varsity, then the rising young barristers would be properly equipped to earn our living. These chambers seem pretty dead. Why don't you two fellows try and find some place where you can get some devilling? Just a bad patch, Sir Douglas. Yes, we all go through it some time or other. - Mr. Parker to see you, sir. - Oh, I'll come straight away. Hello, Parker. Are you the angel in disguise I've been waiting for? - I believe I am. - And a pretty good disguise too. - Well, what's it all about? - Fashionable divorce action. - Oh, very interesting. Sit down - Thank you. - Trouble is, practically no evidence. - And you suggest? Big fee, Sir Douglas. Name your own figure. Besides, I know you like cases that seem impossible to win. Whether I believe in the innocence of the accused. Well, in this case, my client, Mrs. Locke, is very anxious... Mrs. Leslie Locke? - Yes, she's here now. - Here? I hope you don't mind my bringing her without an appointment. But she insisted. Well, if she's her, let's see her. - Show in Mrs. Locke. - Yes, sir. So she wants to get rid of her husband. What a pity. You know, it doesn't seem so very long ago... ...that you and she were seen together everywhere. Ascot, the opera... - In fact I always thought... - Yes, I know. But she preferred the other man. Mrs. Locke, Sir Douglas. You haven't changed, my dear. - Nor you, Douglas. - Won't you sit down? It's strange that I should come to see you after all this time. And on such an unhappy errand. Well now. Has Mr. Parker told you the facts of the case? He has told me of the lack of facts. Of course we may be able to get more conclusive evidence. But I actually saw my husband with that awful creature in his arms. My dear Laura, that proves nothing. Definitely suspicious, I agree. But your husband's an artist and... But does a man's faithfulness depend on his profession? Well, one usually allows an artist a little more license, you know. Even judges who are notoriously ignorant admit that. - Your office on the phone, Mr. Parker. - Oh, thank you. Pardon me. Douglas, you will help me, won't you? I don't know what to say. You mean my evidence is too flimsy, I couldn't win? I was merely wondering how it would look. Everybody knows that I was... ...in love with you. I can hardly go into court and try to gain your freedom from... ...the other man. Then you decline to take my case. - The one man who could help me. - I'm sorry, Laura, but it's difficult. I see. As I've made my bed, so I must... No, no, that's not kind, Laura. I want to help you. Then why do you refuse? If I may make a suggestion, try to understand your husband. I understand him too well. Try to regain once more the sympathy and affection you had for each other. - It's too late. - Why not make the effort? - No, it's too late, I tell you. - Think it over. I won't. I won't be put off. I'll have him watched. I'll try and get the evidence that way. You must do what you think best, but first think over what I said. Come along, Mrs. Locke, we'll see what can be done. I'm sorry. Mr. Parker, can you recommend a good private detective? Well, there's no such thing as a good private detective. We usually employ... You couldn't have come to a better firm We've handled some of the biggest cases going. We have a worldwide organization with ramifications everywhere. You can leave everything to us, Mrs. Locke. There's one thing I must ask you, Mr. Pryor. Please, you will be discreet, won't you? That's our watchword, service with discretion. You see, I don't want to drag my husband's name... - Naturally, with his reputation. - What? As an artist, I mean. You know, my little girl paints. - Only six years old... - How long will it take to get the evidence? Hard to say, that's up to your husband. And the lady, of course. You will put a good man on the job, won't you? It's the only kind we employ, Mrs. Locke. - Bert! - Can he start at once? Immediately. Now, Mr. Cobb here is one of our very best men. - How do you do? - How do you do, ma'am? Why, when Bert was in the force, he was very often on to a job before the crime was committed. And you think you'll be able to get all the evidence I need? Mrs. Locke, you're as good as divorced now, eh, Bert? - That's right. - Thank you. Just leave everything to us. We'll have your husband where you want him in no time. Goodbye, old chap, I'm going in just for a few minutes. - All right, we'll see you later. - Yes, so long. Cheerio! Hello, Laura dear, going to bed so early? I'm sure you've had a pleasant evening. Oh, I was only at the club with Chandler talking shop. He's expecting some friends for a drink and wants to know if we'll join him. - And run into that model of yours? - Oh, Laura, please! I suppose she's not going to be there. No, she's not! For heaven's sake why keep bringing her into it? She means nothing to me, I've told you that a hundred times. Whatever you say or do now makes no difference. It's too late. - Too late? - I'm divorcing you. What? But this is... quite ridiculous! You wouldn't, you couldn't do a thing like that. Oh, afraid of the scandal because it might keep you out of the honor's list. Oh, you know I don't care about a title. Well, that is, I only want it for your sake. Do you think I want a title that comes to me through a man I now despise? A man whose intrigues under my very roof with a common... Laura, stop! I'm sick of this confounded nagging. Go ahead, get your divorce! Name Phyllis Ware, name anybody you like. I'll give you grounds for divorce. I'll be off. But remember! When you do get your evidence, it was your jealousy, your eternal nagging that drove me to her. Leslie! Leslie! Laura! Laura, wake up, I've got to talk to you! I don't want to listen. Go talk to your model. Laura, you must listen. She... She's dead. Murdered. What? - Leslie, you haven't... - You don't think I killed her? No, no, I didn't! I swear I didn't. She was dead when I got there. You do believe me, don't you? You will help me. What can I do? Well... think what it means. Police, detectives... There'll be investigations. Questioning. I may be suspected. Brought to trial. I may even be... Did... did anyone see you? I don't know. That's what terrifies me. When I left her flat it was dark. But I felt somebody there. - Somebody watching. - The detective. - What? - The detective, I... I had you watched. - He must have seen. - Good God! Oh, Leslie, what have I done, what have I done? If nobody else was seen leaving her flat, they're bound to think I killed her. Wait. I can tell them... ...that you were here all night. That you never left the house. You mean that? I'll swear to it. You'll do this for me? Laura. Three o'clock! Nice time to come in! Well, I didn't knock off till early this morning. But I've got the evidence on Locke and the Ware girl. Time, places, everything. - Fine detective you are.. - Huh? - Phyllis Ware was murdered last night. - Eh? Not while I was... - Here, you don't think Locke... - I'm not saying what I'm thinking. You'd better hop over to Scotland Yard and tell them everything you know. - That shouldn't take you long. - I'll tell them all they don't know. - It won't take any longer. - Eh? - You heard. - Here, your book. - Oh, right. - Oh! - Better give them one of our cards. - That's right. And, er... you'll find all the information there. - Thanks very much. I shall want you again. - That's right. - I'll phone for you. - Oh, here's my card. - Perhaps you want your wife followed. - I'm not married. Oh... Well, keep it. You may want some other bloke's wife followed. Telegraphs. Wanted on suspicion of murder. Leslie Locke. Age 37. Five-feet eleven. Brown hair and eyes. Look! It says the police are completely without a clue. Good! Oh, Leslie, you've nothing to fear, I know it'll be all right. "When questioned, the maid reported having seen a man... ...watching near the flat earlier that evening." - Oh, my God! - No, wait. "She described him as a short, heavily-built man... ...wearing a mackintosh and a bowler hat." That couldn't be you. I believe I'm safe. - There are two gentlemen... - Don't trouble, I think he expects us. What do you want? Who are you? - Are you Leslie Locke? - Well, what if I am? We're police officers and I'm going to arrest you for the murder of Phyllis Ware. Oh! - Could I be out to disturbing you, sir? - Come on, Pope. When I'm doing this sort of thing, I like to be disturbed. The truth is that I'm feeling you're rather low in your tropical ware, sir. I don't need tropical ware for the Mediterranean, Pope. I have a feeling that six months in the West Indies... ...would have done you a power of good, sir. Well, if I'd taken on this Mews murder that Parker wanted to rote me in for, ...we could have afforded a trip around the world. Dr. Hackett would never let you take on a big thing like that, sir. In any case, I wouldn't touch it. Pretty obvious that Locke's the murderer. That's what it looks like to me, sir. Whoever that is, I'm busy. Say I'm not at home. - Is Mr. Douglas Rolls in? - No, Madam, I'm afraid he isn't. Oh... then I must wait until he returns. Sir Douglas is very busy just now, Madam, he's leaving town next week. But I must see him, it's urgent, desperately urgent. What is it, Pope? Why, Laura, I had no idea it was you. Won't you come in? Oh, I'm so upset, Douglas, Mr. Parker tells me you refuse to defend my husband. - I'm sorry, Laura, very sorry. - Why? Doctor's orders. He insists I go abroad. But Douglas, you're the one man who can save him. Everything's against him, it's too dreadful. Listen, Laura, I have a certain reputation for defending apparently hopeless cases. - I like fighting for the underdogs, but... - Yes? I can only do so if I'm convinced of the prisoner's innocence. - Of course! - And forgive me for saying this, but from all accounts I am not satisfied that your husband... He's innocent, really he is. Oh, if only I'd taken your advice and tried to understand my husband... ...instead of going to see that detective who's lying. When he says he saw my husband enter that girl's flat, he's lying. What reason has he for making a false statement? I don't know, but I do know that it's false. Because my husband spent the whole of that night with me. - He never went out at all? - No. Oh, what can I say to persuade you? If only you'd see him, talk to him. I know you'd be convinced. I'd like to help you, my dear, but honestly I don't see how I can. Douglas, I'm desperate! I'm sorry, I'd do anything to save you unhappiness but what you ask is impossible. - You once cared for me, Douglas. - I still do. Then help me for my sake. Very well, I'll see him. Why do you insist on denying that you went to that girl's flat? - Because I didn't go. - Do you expect the jury to believe that? It's the truth. In view of the detective's sworn statement that he recognized you... - He was lying. - The detective has nothing to gain by lying. Then he made a mistake. Possibly the murderer looks like me. I strongly advise you to tell the truth however improbable it may sound. It is the truth! My wife will swear that I was with her all night. Locke... - Why did you kill Phyllis Ware? - I didn't, I swear I didn't! Then who did? I don't know, but if I could get my hands on him... We'll leave that to the police. Our immediate concern is to obtain your freedom. - Then you believe I'm innocent? - Yes, Locke, I do. - And you're going to defend me? - Yes. Thank you, Sir Douglas. You've given me fresh courage. That's all right, Locke, I'll see you later. - Thank you. - And you've nothing to worry about. Thank you, sir. You believe his story then? Not one word of it. It all sounds too perfect. But I don't believe he killed Phyllis Ware. All persons who have anything to do... ...before Milords the King's justices of oyer and terminer, and general jail delivery for the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court, draw near and give your attendance. God save the King and Milords the King's justices. The King against Locke. Leslie Locke, you are charged on indictments that you, on the 17th day of July, murdered Phyllis Ware. Are you guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. Gentlemen at the bar, if you wish to object to any of the persons whose names... ...I am about to call to form the jury's trial, you must do so as they separately come to the book to be sworn, and before they are sworn, you will be heard. Alfred Henry Jones. Will you stand up to be sworn? Take the book in the right hand. Read the words of the oath. No use, the court's full up. - Says you! - Here, none of that! I tell you you can't go inside. Say listen, pal, I've been convicted in better courts than this. Hey! None of that, Miss Virginia Cleaver. I swear by Almighty God the evidence I give the court... ...shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth Police Constable John Evans, number 25, B Division. At 8 o'clock in the morning, July 18th, were you in Cheney Walk? - Yes, sir. - Tell the court what took place. Well, sir, I was on me beat, making me rounds, and just as I reached the corner... What's up, what's up? And when the policeman went in, everything was like I told you, sir. Er, show the witness exhibit number 3, yes... And you can identify that as the night dress your mistress had on? Yes, sir. Exhibit number 6. And can you identify that knife as the one found near her body? Yes, sir. Thank you. Tell me, was Miss Ware in the habit of entertaining gentlemen visitors in her flat at odd hours? Oh yes, sir. How many gentlemen would you say were in the habit of visiting Miss Ware's flat? Well, there was Mr. Phil, and Mr. Fred. and Mr... I don't know his name. We used to call him Toddles. And Mr. Bertie and... Oh! Mr. Alfred. He used to call too. It would have been quite possible for any of these gentlemen... ...to have called on Miss Ware on the night of the murder. Oh, no, Mr. Locke was the only one who had a latch key. - You're certain of that? - Yes, Milord. You mustn't call me Milord. Merely a slight anticipation, Sir Douglas. You say the prisoner was a frequent visitor at your mistress's flat. Did you ever hear quarreling when he was with her? I couldn't say, sir. You see, whenever Miss Ware entertained gentlemen, I usually hopped it. Then you couldn't tell us of any quarrels Miss Ware might have had with other gentlemen. - No, sir. - Tell me, did anything ever occur which would lead you to believe that Miss Ware had any enemies? Someone who might want to harm her? Well, on the night she was... done in, just as I was ready to leave, Miss Phyllis came in and said, - Oh, draw the curtains, Gertie. - Aren't you going out, Miss? I'm going to lead a pure life. I must be worthy of a good man's love. Oh. There's such a funny-looking man hanging around outside, miss. - I noticed him earlier this evening. - Chelsea's full of funny-looking men. But he's not an artist, he doesn't look hungry. Perhaps he's waiting for you. A lot of good it'll do him, I'm going to the dance. We go every Saturday night, sir. And when you left the house, was this strange-looking man still there? - No, sir. - Thank you. - Call Eric Hammond. - Eric Hammond! Eric Hammond. Take the book in your right hand. "I swear by Almighty God... Milord, I'll not swear in the name of the Almighty. Why not, on religious grounds? Yes, it's against my principles. Very well, you may affirm. I, Eric Hammond, do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare... ...and affirm that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, ...the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Now, Mr. Hammond, you and the deceased girl were engaged to be married, is that correct? - Yes, sir. - When did you last see her alive? On the afternoon of 17th of July. We went for a walk on the embankment, for about an hour. At that time, during your walk, did she appear perturbed? How do you mean, sir? Well, er, nervous, excited, upset. As one might be after a quarrel. Yes, sir, he threatened to kill her that very day. She told me so. Really, Milord! Mr. Hammond, you mustn't repeat anything said while the prisoner was not present. I'm sorry, Milord, but when I think of what that... - Well, what that man has done, I... - Mr. Hammond! The defense have tried to show there were many men in Miss Ware's life. And succeeded in showing it. Was what you knew about her entirely to her credit? I thought so. Thank you. No questions, Milord. - Call Agnes Carter. - Agnes Carter! Agnes Carter! No questions? What's he up to? No, we usually have something up our sleeves. We? If this is decided, I'll point it to you. Miss Carter, are you a maid in service of the Lockes? Yes, sir. How long have you so been employed? Nearly two years. Would you say that Mr. Locke was bad-tempered? Well, he called it artistic temperament, sir. Had you ever heard him quarrel with Miss Ware? Yes, on the afternoon before she was murdered. Was he threatening her? Well, I didn't hear what he said exactly. But he sounded very angry. Was his tone a threatening one? Yes. And now I want you to look at a picture. Do you recognize that painting? Yes, sir. Will you tell the court in your own words what you know about it? Well... That evening I heard Mr. Locke and Mrs. Locke quarreling. Yes? Then I heard him storm down the stairs and into the studio. Well, well? A few minutes later the front door slammed. Next morning I found the picture slashed. - And now let her look at exhibit 5. - No, 6. Oh, I beg your pardon, 6. Have you seen that knife before? Why, yes, sir, it's Mr. Locke's. It used to hang in his studio. What do you mean "used to"? I hadn't seen it there for some time, sir. Several months, in fact. The last time I saw it... That's a nice, cheerful-looking ornament, I don't think. Yes, I picked it up at Christie's. Used to belong to Lucretia Borgia. Oh, poor woman. I say, she's hard up? Oh... Well, you can lose a lot of money on the Stock Exchange. Now how would you like that dug in your ribs? Now, doctor, answer this question, please. It's a very important one. Could the wound on the murdered woman have been caused by that knife? - Definitely. - Thank you. Or by any other knife of a similar description? - Yes. - Thank you. Now that's enough. It's no good arguing, I tell you you can't come in. What? Why, if it hadn't been for me, there wouldn't have been any trial. - Oh, really? - Yes, "Oh, really". I'm responsible for Locke being taken in the first place. Hm, whom might you be, Sherlock Holmes? That amateur? No, I'm William Pryor, head of Pryor's Private Enquiry Agency. My man's giving evidence today. Well, I'd been waiting around outside the prisoner's house for some time. Not seeing anything of him, I thought I'd see if he'd given me the slip. Not that they ever do, mark you, and gone to Miss Ware's flat. I took up a position outside and... And it struck me then that he was very agitated, sir. Hm. Will the prisoner stand up for a moment? Can you definitely identify the prisoner as the man who came out of that flat? That's right, I couldn't mistake him, sir. I was standing right under the streetlamp... ...and he passed within a few feet of from me. Thank you. No questions, Milord. I think, Sir Henry, this would be a convenient time to adjourn. As Your Lordship pleases. - Well, what's this. - Ch?teau Margot, sir. I thought you kept that for special occasions. - This is a special occasion, sir. - Well, it's just what I needed anyway. Ah, that's the sort of stuff to put life and heart into one. I'm not at all clear on this case, Pope, and that's a fact. You won't win if you worry, sir. You've got to worry about a case like this. - Oh, Pope. - Sir. - Fetch me another glass. - Certainly, sir. Linguard's a cunning old devil. Every possible question, every possible answer worked out in advance. What I want is an unexpected witness. Someone to catch him unawares. Then I might be able to tickle him up a bit. I want you to do me a favor, Pope. Yes, sir. I have a feeling I want someone to drink my health. To wish me success in this case. Someone who cares about it as much as I do. Thank you, sir. Your very good health, Sir Douglas. May you win this case and many, many more. Very good, sir. Excuse me. Does Sir Douglas Rolls live here? He does. Well what is it? - Any chance of me seeing him? - I shouldn't think so. What about? Well, it's in reference to the Mews murder. Oh, come in then a minute. I'll ask him. There's a man to see you, sir. Says it's with reference to the Mews murder. Oh? What type of man is he? Well, he looks to me like he's selling a vacuum cleaner. Perhaps I'd better see him. Ask him in. Good evening. - You want to see me. - Yes, sir. - What about? - About the case you're defending, sir. Oh, is it? - Pope, another glass. - Yes, sir. It may not matter much, sir, but it's... You needn't trouble to show me that, I've seen it already. - Sit down. - It's like this, sir. I was reading the evidence of that detective... ...and it struck me as being a bit queer. It' says here, "I saw his face quite clearly in the light of a streetlamp." Yes, that's right. There's a lamp just outside the front door of Miss Ware's flat. That's right, sir, but I work on night shifts at the power station. And the night the current failed, the lamps in that section wouldn't be on at the time. You're sure the failure happened on that night? Oh, yes, sir. I'm sure of that. It's all down in our report, sir. This is important. I shall want you to give evidence. Not me, sir. The man you want is the electrician in charge. - For me, sir? - Yes. Oh, thank you, sir. - Good health, sir. - Thank you. This is your first surprise, sir. You must get away. Retire from the case. - Let your junior carry on. - What, in the last day of the trial? - Not likely. - Well, why come to me for advice... - ...if you don't intend to follow it. - I didn't come to you for advice. I came to you for something to keep me going. Well if you persist in going on, I refuse to take responsibility. And now, members of the jury, do not think that the witness box holds any tethers with this man. He's eager and anxious to tell you his own story in his own way. Milord, I will call the prisoner. Go into the box now. Now listen to me. You have told Milord and members of the jury... ...you had previously made a present of that knife to Miss Ware. Yes, that is correct. And that's how the knife came to be there? You seriously expect the court to believe that? - I'm only telling the truth! - That's for the jury to decide. Now, one more question before I finish my cross-examination. Do you still persist in your story that you never left your house that night? I do! Paper! Paper! Mews Murder latest! Paper! And you distinctly remember that on this particular night... ...your husband did not leave the house. That's quite true. We were making up our differences. Hoping no doubt to get back on the old terms. To pick up again the happy married life where it started. - Yes. - When your husband is free again, will you take him back, gladly and lovingly? Yes, yes. Thank you, Mrs. Locke. Mrs. Locke, there is just one question I'd like to ask you. Did you file the petition for divorce against your husband? No, Milord, I only contemplated doing so. Thank you. Mrs. Locke, my learned friend has no doubt persuaded you... ...to tell us you had no real animosity toward your husband. Milord, I protest! I have not persuaded the witness in any way. I agree, Sir Douglas. Would it not be natural for you to you to bear a certain animosity... ...towards a man of ungovernable temper? My husband has not a violent temper. Oh, I see. A man who spends months of energy painting a picture... ...then slashes it to ribbons. Wouldn't you call that ungovernable temper? Yes, I would. But I... I understood from a previous witness... ...that's exactly what your husband did. No, that's not true. I slashed the picture. Indeed. That is what you say. But you do admit that your relations with your husband... ...had been strained for a considerable time. Yes. I suggest that he spent more nights away from home than with you. - That's impossible to say. - Answer yes or no. He may have. Ah! Then don't you think you're asking us to believe rather a strange coincidence? I don't understand. Really? Shall I put it more bluntly? Isn't it rather a coincidence that on the one evening, when it was essential to your husband to have been at home all night, you choose that particular evening to make up a quarrel that had been going for months? What are you suggesting? Only this, Mrs. Locke. That the ways of providence are beyond understanding. Milord, I resent my learned friend implying that the witness is not telling the truth. I think that Sir Henry is merely trying to discover the truth, Sir Douglas. We're all here to discover the truth, Milord. - But not by bullying witnesses. - Sir Douglas, when I need your opinion as to how witnesses should be treated, I'll ask for it. As Your Lordship pleases. It's dreadfully hot in this court. It may be hotter still later. Parker... Parker, get me a glass of water. Now my learned friend has subsided, I'll continue. Mrs. Locke, when did you and your husband first discuss the murder of Phyllis Ware? At breakfast that morning. We read it in the paper. - You're quite sure of that? - Quite. My husband was naturally very upset. - I suppose he couldn't eat his breakfast. - That's right. He was too upset, I remember now. You remember he couldn't eat his breakfast... ...because he read the news of the murder in the morning paper. Yes, it's the kind of thing one would remember. Certainly, Mrs. Locke. Except for two facts. Firstly, because the body wasn't discovered until 8 a.m., and secondly, the news was not in the papers until that afternoon. Oh, but... What I, what I... What I meant to say was... Better leave them there. I shall have more awkward questions. But I shall have more awkward papers. Just as I said right from the start. Locke's story is not true. I thought you were convinced of his innocence. Of his innocence I still am. It's obvious his wife's acting in collusion with him. Of course she is, she loves him. If she's not careful, she'll find herself in for perjury. What shall we do then? Don't trouble me with hypothetical problems when we've our backs to the wall. I should say we have. Well, I like having my back to the wall. Then I must go forward. And I therefore ask Your Lordship's permission... ...to recall the prisoner for further examination. This is a most unusual course, Sir Douglas. Milord, certain evidence given yesterday by Mrs. Locke... ...demand such a course in the interest of justice. - Have you any objections, Sir Henry? - On the contrary, Milord. Very well, Sir Douglas. Locke, go back again into the box. You've already been sworn. Locke, do you now realize that you've done a dangerous and wicked thing... ...in persuading your wife to commit perjury in your behalf? Yes. Bearing in mind the consequences of the evidence you are now about to give, are you resolved to tell the truth? I am. Did you go to Phyllis Ware's flat on the night she was murdered? Yes. Why did you go there? Well, I... I left my house in a rage, it's true, intending to see Miss Ware, partly out of spite perhaps, but... But no doubt your anger died down as you walked. - Milord! - Sir Douglas, you must not lead the witness. We are trying a man for his life, Milord. My learned friend's legal quibbling is not going to help us. Sir Douglas, I cannot allow you to tell me what is legal quibbling and what is not. I wouldn't presume to. Your Lordship is an authority on the subject. - Sir Douglas! - In deference to my learned friend... ...I'll frame the question in another way. Did your anger die down? Yes. I remembered how much I owed to my wife. How she had helped me as a struggling young artist. Stuck to me in spite of me... ...infidelities. Go on, please. And I suddenly realized for the first time... ...what a wonderful wife she'd been. So I resolved to try and make up for the sorrow I'd caused her. To start with a clean slate. Well? Well, I went to Phyllis Ware to tell her it was all over. That I could never see her again. And when I got there... Phyllis. Are you asleep? Phyllis! And then I remember running back home. I was almost beside myself with fear, terror, it was awful. - And when you got home? - I told my wife what had happened. I implored her to help me. - And did she consent? - Yes. We agreed to say that we'd been home all night, that I hadn't left the house. And what you have just told the court is the solemn truth. The solemn truth, I swear it. Thank you. You have said that on your arrival at Phyllis Ware's flat... ...you found her dead. Is that correct? Yes. You're quite sure she wasn't alive when you got there? She was dead! I suggest that when you told her you'd come to break off... - She was dead, I tell you. - ...she created a scene! - Threatened to expose you. - I tell you she was already dead. You flew into a rage, seized the knife, and struck her down! No! No, no... Dear me. Very extraordinary. You found a woman in her flat, murdered. And it never occured to you to call the police? Well, I... I realize now that's what I should have done but... I didn't know what I was doing. Hm. I suppose that accounts for the fact... ...that your bloodstained fingerprints were found on the doorknob of her flat. Yes! And my hands had blood on them when I got home too. If I were guilty would I have walked through the streets like that? It's my privilege to ask questions, not answer them. A note for Sir Douglas. You admit that when you got home, your first thought was to concoct a story with your wife. Yes. Was that the act of an innocent man? Well, I... I was almost frantic with terror. Hm, I've no doubt. Take the knife in your hand. I suggest yours was the hand that plunged that knife through the heart of Phyllis Ware. No, no! I didn't! I didn't kill her! Before God I didn't! It is sufficient to answer yes or no. Call Charles Ponder. Charles Ponder. Charles Ponder. Take the book in your right hand. I swear by the Almighty God... What's this? A surprise witness? Well, you know us when we've got our backs to the wall. Charles Ponder. I understand you have something of importance to tell the court. Yes, sir. Will you tell Milord and the jury what it is? Well, sir, I'm on night shift at the power station. And yesterday when I read what the detective said... ...he'd recognized the prisoner in the Mews by the light of the street lamp, it struck me sort of strange he'd say that. Because on the night of the 17th, I was on me job... Emergency lights, quick! How are you getting on? - Well, what's the matter? - That's what we're trying to find out. A short on number 3 circuit, sir. It's all clear now. Good, run her up. I'll be with you in a minute. Take your time, chief. I'm getting a cup of coffee. Yes, Peter's was closed, I had to go to another place. - There's a sandwich here if you want one. - Oh, thanks Better make a note of the time in the log book. Yes. - Do you have any paper? - Yes, there. What time did it start? - 11:10. - 11:33 now. And that's why I came here. You see, sir, the detective couldn't have recognized him by the street lamps. Because they was out from 11:10 to 11:33. Are you certain of the time? I made sure, sir, by looking it up in the log book last night. I want that log book produced in court, Sir Douglas. At once, Milord. Parker, as quick as you can. Thank you. With your permission, Milord, I reserve cross-examination till I've inspected the log book. While we're waiting for the log book, Milord, to verify this question of... time. What's the matter, Rolls? Is anything wrong, Sir Douglas? Oh, no, thank you, Milord. But with Your Lordship's indulgence, I respectfully ask leave to recall Eric Hammond. Have you any objection, Sir Henry? - No, Milord. - Very well. Is Eric Hammond in court? - Can I get you anything? - No, no, thank you, old man. I think it is a question of time. Are you feeling better? Oh, yes, quite all right, Parker, quite all right. I've sent for the log book. Thank you. Eric Hammond. Do you remember telling Ponder... ...to make a note of the time the breakdown occurred? Yes, sir, yes. Show this to the witness. Do you recognize that as the note? Come, come, that is the note, isn't it? Yes. Thank you. Er, just a moment. Were you in court when the detective gave evidence... ...that he was able to identify the prisoner by the light of the streetlamp? Yes. You knew perfectly well there had been a breakdown... ...and that the light in front of Miss Ware's flat must have been out. Well, yes. Why didn't you mention these vital facts to the court? Did you consider them unimportant? I thought so. Hm. Let me see Hammond's previous evidence. You used that identical phrase... in answering a question as to whether Phyllis Ware's character... ...was beyond reproach. Yes. Did you mean " 'I' thought so", or "I 'thought' so"? - What's the difference? - A great deal of difference. In the first place, " 'I' thought so" conveys that you considered her fit to be your wife... ...whatever other people might think. Whereas "I 'thought' so", indicates that you believed so at one time... ...but had reason to alter your opinion later. I don't remember how I said it. Milord, is this a Court of Law or a schoolroom? The interruption of my learned friend... ...reduces it to the level of an infant's class. Eric Hammond, Do you realize that in not mentioning this breakdown, you have been guilty of withholding important evidence? I answered the questions put to me. You suppressed facts which might save this man from the gallows. What's that got to do with me? What's it got to do with you? Is that your attitude towards a trial for murder? He made Phyllis Ware what she was. He deserves to hang. You refuse to swear in the name of the Almighty, yet dare usurp His prerrogative of giving or taking away life! He killed her soul. The prisoner is charged with murder. Nothing else. I think I've got it. Hammond, why were you so long away from the power station that night? Peter's store was closed, I had to go to another place. That's a lie. This note which you identified... was written on the bag you brought from Peter's coffee store... ...which you've sworn was closed. I don't wish to interrupt my learned friend again but... Then don't. Eric Hammond, look at the prisoner. Would you stand idly by and see an innocent man hang? He killed her soul! They both shall die. Fire and brimstone of the Lord's will come down and destroy the lot of you. You apparently believe in a God of vengeance. Do you also believe in a hereafter? Yes! Eternal damnation for such as he. And what about hell on earth? The hell that this man in the dock is going through now... ...and may go through again on the scaffold. Imagine yourself in his place... ...and labor-tread up those steps that lead but one way. The last glimpse of this world as the hood shuts out the sunlight. The rope round your neck, the knot drawn tight by the hangman. The booming of your heart pounding through that awful silence. The silence of doom broken only by the drone of the chaplain's voice, "Brother, make thy peace with God." Seconds become eternities as you wait. Wait for the click of the trap that will hurl your body into that botomless pit. Not the body of Leslie Locke, but that of the man who withheld vital evidence, self-incriminating evidence. The man who lied about his whereabouts on the night of the murder. You know who killed Phyllis Ware! Eric Hammond, do you want two murders on your soul? It was not murder. It was an act of God. I was His instrument! I did it! And I'd do it again! Mary! Mary, it's alright. You... You're not to worry. It's just a mistake. I'd heard things about her that evening. Horrible things. Things I couldn't believe were true. I went to see her... told her what I'd heard, begged her to say they weren't true. She laughed, mocked me. Sneered when I knelt by her bedside to pray for her lost soul. And suddenly... a voice within me spoke. "Like Jezebel she must die." "Like Jezebel she must die." An unseen power put a holy figure in my hand. Gave me holy work to do. I hadn't the courage to do what was right. And I did it! I destroyed her vile body so that her soul might live! "Thy will be done." The poor devil is not responsible. Milord, in view of this... ...confession, I... Look out... - Shall I get a doctor? - Yes... quick, quick! There we go, carefully. Down here on the couch. Now, Rolls... put your head back. That's it. - Are you comfortable? - Yes, yes... A shot in the dark. But it came off. Take it easy now, sir. A religious mania. I saw it... in his eyes. I'd seen that look... in Broadmoor. I'll never forget it. - Don't talk, Sir Douglas. - Can't help it. I've been talking all my life. - Who's his doctor? - Hackett, I think. Get him on the telephone, will you? Tell him I'm... ...taking his advice. It was quite... a long trip. Douglas! Hello, Laura. Don't worry, he'll soon be free now. Oh, Douglas, it's all my fault. Nonsense, my dear. I never could refuse... ...an interesting case. He's on his way. Take him back... ...gladly, ...lovingly. Try again once more... ...with sympathy... ...and affection. Members of the jury, I... do not ask a verdict of... ...not guilty. I demand it! Well, Douglas, feeling better? You were magnificent. You're too late, Sir Henry. He can't hear you. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
