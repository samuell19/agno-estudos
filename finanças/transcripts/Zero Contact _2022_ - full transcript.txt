You often hear people say things like, "Life is strange." But I don't think it's quite as strange as people think it is, because coincidences are not as prevalent as we are led to believe. Now, our time on this planet is far more rooted in cause and effect than any of us believe. And the ancient civilizations knew it, conscious of an interconnectedness that binds us. But if we are connected, why are we so far apart? Cause and effect? Ones and zeroes? But what are the ones and zeroes? Just an invention? A means of distinguishing between a single something and multiple somethings? Someone had to invent numbers to make sense of it. What if those ancient philosophers, visionaries, mathematicians, astronomers knew things most of us don't know? And those things are kept secret from us? What if we only sense that we are bound together in this experiment called humanity, but the real connection is not there? What if there is a grid of energy that stretches from pole to pole? I've discovered that this is the singular truth if not of this universe then certainly of this world. The course I took to figure it out was an arduous one, and the twists and turns while in the midst of them, seem to be, as they say, strange. But such is life. Despite nearly three decades as a public figure of some renown, Finley Hart remains somewhat of an enigma. Hart Enterprises was at the forefront of technological advances such as microprocessors, personal computers, and the creation of the internet, and in the 1980s, moved their headquarters to a sprawling new campus in Northern California. Finley Hart always considered Hart a family business, and hired his sister Rebecca to head up the analytics department. In 1983, Rebecca would introduce Finley to Samantha Hart, a systems engineer who would later marry... As former employees alleged, he has a mercurial personality. Hakan Nordquist, the Chairman of the Board for Hart Enterprises, and close friend of its founder, dismisses such allegations. That's bullshit. What can I say? Okay, is Finley driven? Absolutely. He's driven to innovate, to move forward, to excel, to achieve. Is he tough to work for? Absolutely. But what boss isn't? Thank you very much. ...after renowned software developer Samantha Hart has passed away... Mrs. Hart had suffered a troubled pregnancy and her son was born six weeks premature. Though now is in stable condition. The industry has been rocked by news that Finley Hart of Hart Enterprises has been ousted from the technology firm he founded 34 years ago in Seattle. The Hart Enterprise's board of directors was reportedly blindsided by news that Mr. Hart had diverted company funds to finance a secretive project called the Quantinuum Initiative. Details are sketchy on just what the Quantinuum Initiative entailed. Continued allegations from a former developer for Hart Enterprises who claims some familiarity with the Quantinuum Initiative. Every app he created or financed was designed to collect user data. The more, um, popular apps allowed Finley through the Quantinuum Initiative to seize control of user cameras. Ex-billionaire Finley Hart has reportedly passed away due to complications from kidney failure. ...wife died while giving birth in 1992, he's survived by his sister Rebecca and his son, Samuel Hart. Again, our top story tonight, Finley Hart is watching us no more. Mom, get up. Mom, get up. Get up. Are you just now getting home? Yes. You can yell at me later, okay? - You have a call, remember? - What? - Here. - Shit. Oh... Jeez, Phil, one minute you're swinging your dick talking about what kind of a big shot you are, next minute you're crying poverty. I don't think you understand me, Trevor. My needs changed. And if you can't keep up, I will not pay the balance of your fee. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there, cowboy. Breathe, breathe. Okay. You listening? - Yeah, I'm listening. - Good. Now, we had an agreement, and in that agreement was a deadline. Now you asked me to do you a favor. - Look, I don't need a recap. - Well, you're getting one. Now, in that favor, you asked us to move the deadline. Now, I'll meet that deadline. If you got some personal issues that left you cash-strapped, look, I feel for you, bro, but if you think that you can demand that I finish tonight, and threaten to withhold my funds because you think I'm some kind of nerd you got another thing coming, my friend. I can't move the deadline. Again. And may I ask why? Yes, you may, Phil, because it's date night. - Good morning, Ms. Schultz! - Morning. - How are you today? - Next time you schedule a conference call at the crack of dawn for me my hourly rate will double. Haven't you heard? In early risings, there are blessings and success? I need to make one thing clear and understood before the others hop on. I work for you. I want the deal that works for you. - Certainly. - However, I will not be - dragged into any kind of-- - I would not drag you into anything that you did not feel comfortable. Let me finish. On the call yesterday, you second-guessed me and it makes us both look bad. I am the attorney. If I make a suggestion it's with your best interest in mind. I understand. I regret that I let my temper get the better of me. - Good. - You have my assurances this will not happen again. So say it. I need you to say it. Say, "Veronica, you're the attorney. I'm not." Veronica, you are the attorney. I am not. Thank you. Was that so difficult? Uh, Schultz, are you with us? I never agreed to that, and I never will! Can you get your client to stop yelling? - I'm not yelling. - Ms. Schultz? Look, I'm a nice guy. I'm not trying to-- Gentlemen, stop, I'm sorry. We'll have to pick this up later. I have to deal with a matter of urgent concern. Yeah? Who is it? Urgent enough to skip out on this? Apparently so. Look, just hang out there, it shouldn't take long. Oh, baby. You're not even looking at me. Oh. Taylor... it's about Finley. Finley? Oh, okay. Well, I'll be waiting for you. I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to see you, too. Hey, babe. How you doing? Good. I just got here and my mom is already driving me nuts. How's my boy? Oh, you know what? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. - I meant our son. - I know. He's-- he's doing really good. Uh, hey, though, where did you get that picture of me and Finley and Aunt Rebecca, the one that's hanging in the nursery? I didn't even know you had a picture of you and your dad. Somebody put it up, babe. It wasn't me. It wasn't me, either. You said you wanted to see him again, so I-- - Yeah, so I could tell him what a shit dad he was. Oh, I thought he was down for the night. Take me there. I wanna see him. Okay. Please complete the two-factor authorization steps on the authenticator app. If you do not have the authenticator-- Thank you, Mr. Matsuda. He's sleeping peacefully. Uh, for now. Oh, and here's the photo of Finley I was telling you about. Okay, babe. I got to go. Love you. I love you, too, babe. Well, uh, science is not creative, is it? It's, uh, rigid fact-based, uh, but art, by its very nature, is, uh, creatively-based. And, uh, what is creativity? Well, oftentimes, creativity is about connection, is it not? I mean, take for instance this, uh, ubiquitous thing. Uh, the first cell phone simply connected two, uh, specific ideas, uh, or the existing ideas, the phone and radio waves. And later, the internet and the cell phones led to the creation of the smart phone. And, uh, the functioning of these devices is based solely on the aforementioned science of radio waves, you know, information technology, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But it took creative minds to, uh, connect these scientific principles in a-- a, you know, practical, um, user-friendly, uh... Alright. Welcome. State your name, title, or former title for the group. Title? I-- I don't have a title or position. Somebody wanna tell me what the hell is going on here? You're here because you were chosen to represent the Quantinuum Contingency Group. Joining you are Trevor Williams, former Chief Technology Officer for the Quantinuum Initiative, Veronica Schultz, former outside counsel for the Quantinuum Initiative, Riku Matsuda, former Chief Innovation Officer for the Quantinuum Initiative, and Hakan Nordquist, Chairman of the Board of Directors for Hart Enterprises International, which funded and disbanded the Quantinuum Initiative. Sam Hart. Proxy for Finley Hart. Hey, man, it's been a minute, huh? How you been? I'm sorry. Do we know each other? Yeah, we met at the visitation after, well, you know-- Sorry about your dad. Must have been tough. Thanks. But can we proceed? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Prior to his death, Mr. Finley Hart chose each of you to be a part of the reactivation plan. You're talking about that machine, aren't you? Yes. Step one of the reactivation protocol has been completed. What? Who-- who reactivated it? The purpose of this call is not to ascertain who took the initial step towards reactivation, but to complete the reactivation and therefore allow the machine to become fully functional. What is the Quantinuum Initiative? It doesn't matter what it is. We were given explicit information and instruction what we should-- - No-- It matters to me. - Why? Maybe I met you at the funeral or the visitation, okay? Maybe I met all of you. But I don't know any of you and I certainly didn't know Finley. All I know is he lost control of Hart Enterprises. So, you'll excuse me if I wanna know a little bit more of why the hell we're all here. I mean, you clearly all know each other. I don't know any of these people except the counselor. Okay, we all worked for your father in various capacities over a span of maybe 20 years. Our paths may have crossed but no, we are not well acquainted. Yeah, were you a part of his ouster? Were any of you? I voted in favor of keeping him. And then I was let go. - He was a good man. - If you say so. So, what the hell is the Quantinuum Project? It's fringe science, Sam. Alien contact, micro-technology, artificial intelligence, alien technology. As I understand, the biggest breakthroughs were in displacement technology. You mean like moving objects? Like teleportation? Exactly. Teleportation, moving objects, people. And, well, while Ms. Schultz is correct to say that the Quantinuum Initiative saw the biggest breakthrough in the field of displacement technology, it was also where we experienced our biggest controversies. The central aspect of the project was the machine, a device your father developed in secret. Which theoretically would power the technology we created. Looks like somebody didn't know pops was into some weird shit, huh? We need to get on with this. Our instructions from Finley were clear and-- We're missing someone. Hakan, are you still with us? Some lunatic is staring right into my window. Is it a chick pissed off at you or a guy? - Mr. Williams-- - Hey, I'm not judging. Do you know him? I don't know. There's something strange with his face. He's, uh, dizzy. Did you say dizzy? Yeah, he's like, um, drunk. Hey... Look at the lawyer getting jumpy. I'm sorry. I'm back. Can we go on with this now? I have a tight schedule today. Oh, yeah, me, too. But what you doing? Well, that's none of your business. Host, can you please guide us through the procedure? My pleasure. Each of you should have received a password. You were told to keep this password safe. At this time, please locate your password and enjoy some music while you wait. This is one of Finley Hart's favorites. I hope you enjoy it. Sorry, I almost forgot how weird Finley could be. God, I love this song. You okay, Veronica? I'm fine. Uh, sorry, uh... I'll be right back. Me, too. Ego. No. But you have been labeled. I have? Oh, God, I'll be. Oh, I hope not. Um, labels-- labels are so boring, don't you think? I mean, you know, labels are the, um, uh, the lazy people-- no, shall I say person? The lazy person's way of, uh, reducing the more industrious person to a-- a singular essence, so to speak. Or to a particular character trait, uh, you know, I'm saying? Um, because, uh, in my experience, um, the persons I've met or dealt with, um, is far more complex, far more complicated than let's say, um-- Oh, I don't know, hastily tagged on label, uh, you know, created by yet another half-witted moron sitting in the corner of his office scratching his balls all day long with his thumb stuck up his inside of the ass, you know what I mean? "You have been chosen. Reactivate the Quantinuum device." Shit. - Are we sure about this? - Sure about what part? You were Finley's, what, IT guy? Uh, it's a tad more complicated than that, dude. Well, so-- so walk me through it. All right. You ever heard of distributed ledger technology? Blockchains, sure. Yeah, I'm familiar. You know, I-- I started with your dad-- When did Finley start this thing, the Quantinuum Project? What, officially? He talked about it for years. I met him in grad school. He was giving a lecture at MIT. Said he came up with it when his wife passed away. So '92? Yeah. I mean, he went all over the world to find funding. But he made it official when he finished the lab in 2008. No, no, no, 2009. Yeah. - Um, did you read this letter? - We all read it. And it doesn't scare the shit out of any of you? You don't trust your father, do you? I don't have a father. Finley's, um, he's a guy to me. Ah... You're a lot like him. I'm surprised his crazy ass found five people he trusted. Well, I knew him well, and I trust him implicitly. And don't call him crazy. So, you-- you know him so well, what's your best theory on why he made me proxy? Mr. Hart, I know that your father died with deep regret that he didn't make more of an effort to develop a relationship with you. Yeah. I bet he did. Hey, just for the record, I meant a good crazy, like, - Finley, you crazy bastard. - Sorry, I'm back. - Oh, great. - Yeah, let's just get on with this. I couldn't agree more. Host, can you please remind us of the procedure? It would be my pleasure. Has everyone found their secure password? - Yes. - Excellent. At the bottom of the letter, you will find the address to a secure FTP site. Please take a moment to log on. ♪ If you like piña coladas ♪ No. Just no. Geez, Hakan, take your time, why don't you, huh? Shut up. - It's-- it's case sensitive. - Shut up. I'm in. Excellent. You now have 60 minutes to input. Where-- where is he going? I'm just getting my water if that's okay with you. He's back. Ooh, gross. What did he say? He said that asshole puked in the street. That's exactly what I said. What? I did a gap year in Sweden. What's he doing? Wait. Hakan? He's gone. What do you mean gone? Hakan! Hakan? Dude's been gone for five minutes. Maybe he's getting second thoughts. Why would he be having second thoughts? - Shut up, Mr. Williams. - No, answer my question. He wouldn't be getting second thoughts. Mr. Hart, you'll have to forgive Mr. Williams. During his time with Hart Enterprises, Mr. Williams thought it wise to supplement his income as a sort of hacker for hire. False. I never thought it was wise. In any event, his actions created significant liability issues for Hart Enterprises, and I was surprised your father invited him back a year later. Yeah. Invited me back, and trusted me with this. Does that surprise you, too? Surprise isn't strong enough a word. Jesus. I get it. Why would Hakan be having second thoughts? He wouldn't. You're insinuating or suggesting that, um... a person can be, uh, labeled in many ways, is that right? - Correct. - Is that correct? It is, okay. Wow. Golly gosh. I'm sorry, old sport, I had no idea because, you know, my ego is far too big, far too, um, fragile to, uh, read my paper clippings. And, um, it's a habit I kicked 30 years ago. But what I do know about, uh, people or persons is that, uh, whatever they say about me, is that, um, it's either, um, excessive praise, which borders on sycophancy, or just, uh, venomous denunciation which borders on, uh, um, slander, you know? The machine runs on dark matter reactor. M-- Meaning that its power source interacts with gravity? Yes, fundamentally, but Finley found a way to capture it in a tachyon field. A tachyon field? How does it stabilize? I don't know what any of that means, but-- The tachyon field must remain intact or the anti-matter could expand starting this-- this-- this chain reaction. That could cause a worldwide electromagnetic event. Yeah. Which could, in turn, sheer the-- the electromagnetic shield around the planet allowing these massive amounts of solar and cosmic radiation to-- to-- to scorch the surface of the earth. Oh, is that all? Riku, is that true? It's true. That's a possibility, yes. It was. It was a source of much debate within the Initiative. And when the board discovered that Finley was doing-- They ousted him. Yeah. And all the stuff that made the news, and diversions of funds and-- It was itself a diversion. You now have 53 minutes to input the-- Hey, guys, we're not alone on this call. - What? - Yup. Yeah, someone tapped into the line. How-- how come we-- we can't see them? - It's, uh-- look, I can't explain it. - - Well, give it a go. Well, can you sum up contract law in five seconds in a way I can understand? You sign a contract, you abide by it. Okay, bad example. Can you tell where they-- they are? No. No, but whoever it is, they're really good. They're really-- Is that Hakan? Hakan? I don't know. It appears that Mr. Nordquist has disconnected. - Please enjoy this music until he's back online. Hey, you guys, that was not Hakan. - You don't know that! - Is the song necessary? Not at all. Riku, what-- what are you doing? Riku. Wait, just give me a minute. Jesus, this is absurd. - Hello. - Hey, Doug. It's me. Me, who? Riku Matsuda. Sorry. When's the last time you checked on the equipment? Riku, the equipment is safe. It's locked up, I have eyes on it 24/7 I need you to check it! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Who do you think you're talking to? Sorry. I'm on a call with the Quantinuum Contingency team. Okay. Who are they? I say the rest of us input our codes and be done with it. - Hey, do we still have a visitor? - Yup. Okay, so, any luck figuring out where they are, who they are? Oh, I was supposed to do that, huh? - Well-- - Couldn't hurt, could it? It's coming from inside the house. Just kidding. Can you please just check the equipment? Come on, I'll take you over there. Jump onto FaceTime. Mr. Matsuda. In a minute. Well, as you would say nowadays, um, it's all truth-adjacent, shall we say, or is it adjacent-truth? I'm not sure. But it's bit of a conundrum, isn't it? The point is that none of these, uh, the fealty and obeisance, uh, thrown my way has anything to with me, but with my achievements. And while there may be, uh, kernels or seeds of truth in, um, these, uh, allegations or these accolades or castigations, um, no, I'm-- I'm sorry. None of these define exactly who I am. All right. No, no, no. What is it? Call the Foundation. - Why? - It's not here. Call the Foundation, right now. Riku, it's gone. It's empty. Look, it's empty. Sorry. Is Hakan back? - Negative. - What are you doing? I'm calling the Foundation. What's the Foundation? The Foundation oversees - remaining corporate interests. - Shit! No answer. It's not a place of business. They don't have working hours. Well, I thought it was worth a shot. And you made a valiant effort, but we should have already entered our passcodes. Guys, I'll be right back. What the hell is this? Sorry about earlier. If you say so, Mr. Williams. Look, me and Finley, we're tight. You knew that. So were you really surprised that I was one of, uh, the chosen? Mr. Williams, you put the company at jeopardy with your erratic behavior and your dependence issues. Right. What time is it there again? What if we punch in our codes? Give it a whirl, sure. Access denied. It's case sensitive. You really are insufferable. Still no answer at the Foundation. Access denied. May I ask why? When one or more Contingency members are signed, the system will automatically lock down. To override the system lockdown, please enter the 20-character secure override password. - Any ideas, Trevor? - Twenty characters? Might have to think on that a minute. You have 50 minutes to input the codes. Would you like to listen to music while you wait? No. No, no, no. We would not. What on earth are you laughing at? Nothing. It's-- this is so Finley. "You will receive a message on this phone. Start the video attached to the message." Hey, it's me. So, anything? There's no sign of forced entry. And the outside alarm wasn't triggered, so whoever it was had the passcode to my entire security system. Wait a second. "Your legacy is yours and yours alone." Hey, counselor, I'm really sorry to change the subject because I love talking about what a piece of shit I am, but I'm tracking this, uh, secret caller... And? I'm getting pinballed all over the world here. Hawaii, New York, Little Rock, Dallas, Texas. No, wait-- Dallas, Georgia. Did you guys know there was a Dallas, Georgia? Mr. Williams. Right, right. So, look, the point is right when I think I'm gonna pin him down, I get rerouted. What is it? Riku, I'm gonna send you something... ...and you better get a handle on it. Call the Foundation. Do it now. - I did. - Keep trying until you get through. Oh, shit. - Make the call. Do it now. - Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. - Oh, shit. - What? Did you know there was a Los Angeles in Chile? And rerouted again. Goddamnit. Oh, great. I was worried I missed something. Hakan's back up. Hey! Forty-eight minutes remaining. I'm not even gonna ask what that was. I think we should do what it says. - Abort mission. Game over. - I couldn't agree more. - Thank you. - We can't. - We made a commitment. - Commitment? Commitment my ass, Veronica. No one, I mean, no one short of Finley Hart himself can convince me-- We can't punch the code in anyway. Why not? Because the system locks down. Locks down tight, requires 20-character password. Wait, so-- so can you hack it? Not in the 47 minutes we have. Trevor, uh, I know you were loyal to Finley. And I was, too. He-- he taught me everything. Everything I know, but we also-- we also need to bear in mind that he-- he was bat-shit crazy. He taught you everything you know, but he didn't teach you everything he knew. He chose you and you accepted, so we are not aborting and don't call him bat-shit crazy. Why is it that today we are-- nowadays we are, uh, compelled and-- to use these big, big words like the truth, the narrative, and, uh, you know, the optics. Ooh. And, uh, why are we so-- we are-- why do we all so desperately need to be defined? Can you tell me? Because it sure as hell beats the crap out of me, kiddo, I'll tell you that. Anyway, never mind, it's no problem. Um, you know, for all my faults, I just, uh-- simply I wanna make people better or just, you know-- not even those around me. Anyway, thank you for a wonderful interview. I really have to go 'cause I'm rather tired. See, I don't have long to live, you see? But none of us do, do we? But then life is a blur, isn't it, you know? Yeah. That's right, an illusion. A dream within a dream. Strange twists, uneasy turns in the road. Ah, yes, and another thing, I'll tell you this for-- for free. Um, there are far too many people in that final turn in the road. You know what I mean? Far too many people who are about to realize quite suddenly and only too late, I'm afraid, that they're about to hit the fucking wall. And that nobody cares. And nobody ever has cared in the whole of human history. It's so strange-- strange little creatures we are. All right. What good would it do to contact the Foundation? Maybe they're aware of the breach and can pinpoint the source. Why did this person bring Hakan back online? We couldn't punch in the codes. He could have stopped us. Yeah, no shit. My-- my guess is it's because... Okay... - Remember what I said earlier? - Sort of. Yeah, the electromagnetic event. - Yeah, that. - There's also the possibility that not inputting the codes will destabilize the field. Wait. So the same thing as putting the-- No. Not-- not exactly because the power source has been partially reactivated. So the theory goes, it is already expanding and could fracture the temporal continuum. The tem... the temporal continuum? Like, reset the space-time continuum? I mean, start over. Back to the Ice Ages, so to speak. Jesus. I mean, it's not a theory I agree with. - Hold on. - Forty-five minutes remaining. I have another number for the Foundation, Riku. Try this. What? Why didn't you tell us that earlier? Because I don't trust any of you. Okay, I'm tired of being dragged through your company bullshit. I've dealt with it my whole life. You didn't earn that money. You're a trust fund kid. Did whatever you wanted your whole life, waiting around for Daddy to fill your pockets. Don't. No. Don't pretend to know me, Trevor. It makes you look stupid. Finley was never in my life, but the company's antics completely destroyed whatever life I had. And you know what? I busted my ass to get through school. Bussing tables, tending the bar, taking out loans. - No one ever gave me anything. - All right. All right. Easy. My bad. We might as well call the Foundation and see what they can do. Yeah. Sure thing. Got it. I'll find out what I can. - Let's take a break... - Fair enough. ...and reconvene in five minutes. - Yeah, fine. - Fine. Please enjoy this music until the other parties rejoin the call. Oh, Finley. Please tell me at least one of us is inebriated, babe. Not quite yet but getting there. Are you on your way? I wish. Look, I'm sorry. - Talk to you later, okay? - It's okay. I'm drinking for two until you get here. Hi. This is Riku Matsuda. Um, you may know me already. There's a situation that I need to tell you about. Hey, Sam. I wish we had time to catch up. I know you must have a million questions to ask me, but I'm afraid I don't have time to answer them. And I know I wasn't always the best father, or any kind of father at all, come to think of it. Oh, I was a son of a bitch. But, anyway, um, yeah, I think when your mother died, I lost all touch with humanity. That sounds like a crock of old horse shit, doesn't it? "I lost all touch with humanity. Boo-hoo." Anyway, you know what I mean. I'm-- I'm sure it got to you, and I'm sure it, uh, hurt you a lot, and, um-- anyway, uh... You know, I'm just sorry your mother's, uh, death coincided with, uh, your birth. But that's enough of all that. It's water under the bridge, as the man said, you know? Water under the bridge. Anyway, where's the point-- ah, yes. Now, here we are. As you remember, I, um-- Yeah, I, uh, I dived or dove, or whatever it was, I plunged deep into the heart of the-- the Quantinuum Project. Do you remember? And, uh, yeah, it was the main focus of my life. I was, uh-- it took me years before I let my guard down. And, um, yeah, if I remember it correctly... Years before I woke up-- it was the year 2002. Yeah, I came to my senses, I guess, or maybe I went back to sleep. Who knows? But, anyway, I remember it clear as yesterday. It was, uh, God, it was that glorious dream, like summer way up in Cloud Cuckoo Land. Where was that? Northern California. Yeah. East of Carmel. East of Eden, I used to call it 'cause that's where it all started, wasn't it? The Land of Nod on the East of Eden. Yeah. The Hart Enterprise. Oh, my God. They were crazy. They were all really crazy. But I was crazier than all of them. Did you know that? Yeah, I was bored out of my skull. - I'd been for years now for the big... - and all... And, uh, I'm still here for something God knows what-- Well, talk about God. Yeah, Aldous Huxley, he was my God. The Doors of Perception. God. Yeah, that's when it all started. You think I'm crazy? I'm not. But I'm sure you must realize by now that I'm very much alive. And, uh, yeah. I, uh, can't reveal my location to you, of course, and I cannot, um, communicate with you in any other way. But my death, or my so-called death, was something that had to happen. You understand? Anyway, that's another story. This is the point, um, Sam. And, uh, it is important that you hear me out. Really, it's because I'm gonna need your help, if that's okay, you know? I hope so anyway. Um, so here's the deal. The people or the faction that drove me out of the Hart Enterprises will not allow the machine to remain functional, and it is essential and vital to humanity that it does remain functional. You understand? It will not be enough for them, uh, you know, to-- They'll talk to you and try to persuade you to stop. No. Because they will keep coming. They will not stop! Because they're adamant, you know? And beware because these are the real psychos, the real wackos. The only way you can beat them is to, um, punch in those codes. And you have, in my estimation, just under an hour. Anyway, this is the point-- 'Cause these clowns, if they, um, can prevent you or stop you or, you know, even hack into codes, the machine will rupture and cause a globe-killing disaster event. And it'll be bye-bye. And I'm serious, you know? So, um-- and they will not stop, you know? They will come and find you. I mean, for example, the only one in their group, in your group, that they knew about was that guy Hakan, and they'll find the rest of you because, you know, uh, boundaries don't matter, and distance doesn't matter. You know, I'm halfway around the world and I, uh, connected with you in, um, it was a millisecond, wasn't it? And, um, anyway-- what-- what else was I gonna say? Oh, yes, yes. I have a-- I have a-- I've got-- I've got a device for you, uh, Sam. I'll explain it later. But I've placed the device in a box together with, uh, several face masks, okay? And they're in-- the box is in the closet of the bedroom you used when you came to visit me. Do you remember? So you must get the box and you must wear the face mask at all costs. What else was I gonna say? That's about it, I think. Um... so download these codes. Don't neglect and don't delay. And, um-- Oh, something else I wanted to say. Something, um, having seen you in that old house with your son. Good-good-looking boy there, Sam. Don't do to him what I did to you. - No, I won't. - I don't know if you know this, but, um, I always expected great things from you, Sam. Did you know that? Yeah. So now is your chance to fulfill the destiny I hoped for you. Everyone in your team has been, um, chosen and has a reason. They all have a purpose, and I'm sure you will find your purpose. So good luck to the team. Wear the face masks. Wear those face masks. And I'll see you around. Hey. Hey. Hey, what's up? - Are you okay? - Yes. Yeah. I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine. Is it really him? My mom said there was a box for me. It had a phone, some videos. He said I was the only one you would listen to. - Fringe science? - Yes, Katherine. Fringe science. Do you know how goofy that sounds? Yes. I-- yes. Okay. So did you know he was into-- I don't know anything about him, Katherine! I have told you all of this! He was not a father to me. - I was raised by my Aunt Rebecca. - Raised by his sister. I know. He's... Ah. Sammy boy. Swear you did not put that photo in the nursery bed. - Swear. - I've never seen the picture, Sam. I promise. He's your father. Would he lie to you about something like this? Yeah. Have you ever... Have you ever been to Coney Island? No? Um... My dad would always be chasing funding, you know, when I was a kid. And, uh, he had some Wall Street guy, just had him on the hook. Just trying to reel him in. And it was the one, like, business trip that he took me on that he actually spent any time with me. It was the one time. So he ended up taking me to Coney Island, and then, uh, he put me on the Cyclone. You know, the place, like the old-- just some rickety, old wooden roller coaster. And I must have ridden that a dozen times, and... I don't know-- you know, I go around and I-- I'd see his face in the crowd. I'd wave and smile. You know, he-- he'd wave and smile back, and it would just, you know, just go around. And every time that was our-- that was a thing. Until one time it came around and he just wasn't there. He got a page and left. I was nine. It felt like I-- I had gotten swallowed up into just a sea of people. And I was terrified, so I just-- I-- I ran to the beach, and I just walked up and down the shoreline just sobbing until my Aunt Rebecca picked me up. He came-- I don't know, it was like a couple days later he came back. And he said, "Hey, my bad, kid. I won't do it again." And I-- I think about that specific time all the time, and I feel embarrassed because I believed him. That was the one trip we did anything fun. My Aunt Rebecca wouldn't let me see him after that. So, I can't just blindly trust anything that he's saying to just be the truth. I understand. Okay. I'm gonna log back online, I'm gonna see if I can wrap my head around this. Um, but, hey, I love you. Welcome back, everyone. So I talked to William at the Foundation. Check out Hakan's window. Who the hell is that guy? What the hell is going on? Access code accepted. Thirty-five minutes remaining. I recommend that each of us punch in-- Hang on. Mom, who's that man outside? Veronica? - Veronica? - What? Hey, is there some place in your house you can hide? - Why? - This man, he'll do the exact same thing to you he did to Hakan, okay? This is way bigger than we know it is. - What? How do you know? - Listen, I just know. Yeah, but how? Half hour ago you were all, - "What are here for?" and now you're an expert. He's trying to get into my house. Do not let him get the password. Can you get out of there? And go where? Okay, is there some place in your house you can hide? Mom. Oh fuck. I'm not here to hurt you. Just tell me where your computer is. Where is your computer? - Veronica? - Ms. Schultz has disconnected. Is there another way she can punch in her code? Where are you going? - Uh, I got to get some air. - Get some air? Yes, some air, dammit. This shit is freaking me out, okay? I need to go out, clear my head. Is that okay with you? - Sure. Whatever. - Yeah, sure. Whatever. Thirty minutes remaining. One passcode received. Uh, come on. Four passcodes remaining. Is he gone? Shh. Veronica? It's me, Sam. - Sam? - Yes, it's me. Sam Hart. That's impossible. How did you--? I don't know. That song. Veronica, when I was little, I remember one time he was driving us somewhere and that song came on. He smiled, turned it up, and I had never seen him like that. And I asked him why he liked that song so much and he said, "It reminded me of someone." He talked about you. I never knew who you were but I knew about you. He loved you. I know that. I know he loved you both very much. When I leave, you have to put in those codes. Do you have another computer? Yours is shot. - Jamie-- - Yeah. Yeah, I do. We have. Veronica, you really loved him, didn't you? It was more than-- It was more than anyone will-- will ever understand, Sam. That song, it means something, doesn't it? I saw your face when the song started. It looked like it took you back to something. We went to Sydney to close a deal. All business. He was always all business, you know? Finley, me, and a few others went out to celebrate. We went to some dive bar. You know how much he loved dive bars. And... that song was playing, and I couldn't convince him that it was not called "If You Like Pina Coladas." It was the first time I saw him as a... as a real person. He has difficulty letting people in, Sam. But when he does... it's permanent. Veronica, I can see why he loved you. Jamie. Okay, I'll see you soon. Yeah. - Here, Mom. - Thank you. Thank you, Jamie. Oh, my God. Ah, attagirl. Override lockdown code accepted. In the event one or more parties sign off, the system will no longer lock down. Passcode accepted. Twenty-five minutes remaining. Three passcodes remaining. Hey, okay, um, can you do me a favor? What? I need you to look into Hart Enterprises and see who opposed Finley. Who was the one that forced him out, okay? Okay. Thank you, baby. I love you. Riku, who did you talk to at the Foundation? A man named William. How did you get the technology? That-- that's a long story. William's not on our side-- Finley's side. - How do you know? - Trust me. Wait. He was-- he was at Veronica's? Yes. How can you be sure it was him? You've never been involved in-- in-- Because he's my cousin. Riku, how sure are you about both scenarios? I'm reasonably certain that if we punch in the codes, the machine will melt down. I need you to quantify your certainty. Well, according to the test we ran and the research-- No, no. Just give me the number. Seventy percent chance that the machine will melt-- melt down. And if we don't input the codes? It's an 11% chance not inputting the codes will-- No. Why-- why the variance? That doesn't make sense. 'Cause the-- the power source is unstable. And there's a chance that... There's a chance that your-- your-- your father rigged the machine. What does he care? He's dead. It-- it-- it won't affect him. Who did you call, Riku? What? I called the Foundation. No, no. You called someone else. Who was it? And when Hakan saw the person in his front yard and he said that they appeared dizzy and nauseous, you knew what was happening, didn't you? No. I don't-- I don't know what you're talking about. You know about this tech, don't you? You know among other things that it can cause vestibular disorder. Answer him, Riku. You told us the tech never functioned, but that was a lie, wasn't it? Did you know that the person who killed Hakan was using the displacement technology? Answer me, Riku! Answer him! I had my suspicions. - Hello, Douglas. - They've entered two numbers already. Yes, William told me. What's your read on Riku? - Think he'll cave to Sam? - No. No way. Rebecca, you tell William he's off limits. - We had conducted successful tests before. - - When? I can be there in less than a minute to ask you face to face. Back when I was at Hart Enterprises, your father had disagreements about how to best improve the technology. Is that why you teamed up with my aunt and Doug Mancini to orchestrate a coup? Your father was acting erratically! He was sick! He was-- he was-- he was a megalomaniac! Your brother completely miscalculated what Riku brings to the table. I mean, that's how I recruited the guy in the first place, right? Yes, but you didn't exactly recruit him for his resolve, did you? I'll tell William that he's an ally. Anything else? Yeah. Hakan was dead. So someone had to punch in his code for him. You think we have a wildcard in the game? You think we don't? I'll talk to William. You convince Riku to stick to his guns for 19 more minutes. Shit. So what's it gonna be? Are you gonna punch in the code? I'm scared to. Finley may have been who you say he was. I know he was a shitty father. But he was also a visionary, and this is his life. And you're gonna-- you're gonna break your commitment to him just because Rebecca's better for the bottom line? Punch in your code. Punch in your code, Riku! No! Do not answer that. You-- I know you wanna do the right thing here. Riku, punch in your code! Damn it! Riku Matsuda has disconnected. Seventeen minutes remaining. Trevor, you still with me? I don't know who I'm with. I thought you said you were getting used to it. I thought I was. I'll be all right. When are you leaving for Trevor's? I have Riku's computer and his passcode. - I mean, there's no need-- - Did you destroy his computer? Not yet. I just made it back, and I've been chundering in the loo. Destroy it. Finish this. He's gonna kill me. Hey. You having fun? Babe, you look stressed. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Look, uh, I'm really sorry, but I'm right in the middle of something really important, - and I can't explain it. - Are you gonna make it? Of course, yeah. I'm gonna make it. Why can't you go to the Foundation, or whatever you call it? Finley didn't leave me the coordinates. - Were you close with your cousin? - Not really. I mean, my aunt favored him, but why wouldn't she? Okay. Um, I got to go. I'll-- I'll call you back. Um, I am just gonna go home. So, I'll see you in a little bit. You're the best. Foot rubs for a month, okay? And more. All right. I'll see you soon. Bye, babe. How long you been together? Fourteen years. - Where'd you meet? - Come on. Don't start this buddy-buddy stuff, Sam. Out of all the people in this mess, I trust you the least. Why is that? Because nothing about you adds up. You don't trust Finley, you do trust Finley. You don't wanna punch in the codes, then you do wanna punch in the code. Riku's gone. Hakan's dead. Veronica-- Look, the only person I trust in all of this is Finley, and he's gone, too. And that man took me in after I messed up. But you, you, you... Why didn't you just go save Riku, hmm? Like you did Veronica? I could-- I thought I could convince him. Or zip over, and punch in the code like you did Hakan. Like I did what? Hey. Sam, can you hear me? Anyway, I tell you, if you don't punch in those codes, it's over. You got me? We are dead, we're all dead. Babe, I told you-- - I have your wife. - Who the hell are you? I know more about the power sources of that machine than anyone on this planet, and you better believe because they've severely underestimated its stability. I won't harm her, so long as you comply. You goddamn son of a bitch. - Trevor-- - If you hurt her, if you hurt her, I swear to God! No threats, Trevor. Do not put in the code. Just tell Trevor something from me, would you? I want you to tell him about that night he met his wife, Taylor. They were in the Florida Keys, a hole in the wall dive bar, in Marathon, I think it was. Okay. O-okay. Okay. What do you want me to do? Just don't hurt her. Destroy your laptop. Stay in your apartment. When I have proof you've destroyed it-- Okay. Okay, just hold on, I'll do it right now. Fourteen minutes remaining. Spotted 20 bucks and, uh, told him to buy her a drink. Trevor, no, no, no! Hey, stop, stop! What's going on? He's gonna kill my wife! Trevor, st-- no, no. Trevor, he's lying. We have to input the codes. Trevor, listen, listen. Trevor, no, no! We have to input the codes. He's got my wife. Okay, what if the only person that you trust is still alive? He remembers when you met your wife in the Florida Keys, at a-- at a dive bar in Marathon. Uh, you were drinking margaritas and shooting pool. And he-- um, she came in with her friend. She was so pretty, made you scratch on the eight ball. And then, you lost, uh, your last 20 bucks, and you came over to me, and you said-- Back off, Finster. - She's mine. - She's mine. Yes! And then, he spotted you a 20 to buy her a drink. I traced that call. All this time, I traced it. He wants you to put in your code. Nine minutes remaining. Let me talk to her. I said no threats. - Okay, I'll destroy it. - Trevor, no, no! Just give me five seconds with her. That's all I need. Prove to me that she's okay. - Hey, babe. - Hey. What's happening? Come on. Come on. Come on. Run, baby, run, run! Run, baby. I'll kill you! Get back here! - Babe, let me in. - Ma'am. - Let me in. - In here. - Ma'am, are you okay? - I'm okay. I guess I'll find out soon enough if that worked. Passcode accepted. Eight minutes remaining. I'm sorry I hurt you. I remember that day, too. But, uh, I never knew it got to you, you know. And, uh, that's why I tried to make it up to you. Um, yeah, I love you, Sam. Don't like saying that too much. Don't like all this... love and fondness racket. It makes me feel creepy. Anyway, um, yeah. I... I can... I can go back. Oh, I can-- I can go back. Temporal, temporal, temporal displacement, it's time travel. I can go back. Temporal, temporal displacement. It's time travel. I can go-- I can go back. Sam, I've got to caution you. Um... Any small change you make will cause ripple effects, okay? You'll be tempted to save someone's life. I know I was. But a change that big can cause, not just a ripple, but a big tsunami, okay? So be warned. I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner, Hakan. I'm sorry. Passcode accepted. Thank you, Mr. Matsuda. The Quantinuum Initiative is now online and fully operational. Hey. How's she doing? She's on her way up to me right now. - Thank you. - No, no. Thank you, Trevor. Hey, didn't you wanna know where I traced that call to? I think I know. And-- and if I don't, then... Yeah, you can go anywhere, any time. Yeah. I gotta go, uh... I gotta go check in on somebody. Shocking news from the tech world today, as Rebecca Hart, the sister of late eccentric billionaire Finley Hart, was arrested for a litany of charges including conspiracy to commit murder. Authorities say the murder of former Hart Chairman Hakan Nordquist was carried out at Mrs. Hart's behest, by her son, William Porter, who now faces charges in Sweden. Mrs. Hart allegedly collaborated with former Hart Enterprises Head of Security, Doug Mancini, to not only oust Finley Hart from the company, but to steal developing technology from the company. Federal authorities have issued a warrant for Mr. Mancini's arrest, in connection with the still unraveling conspiracy. You know, this piano is like an old friend to me, always has been, source of inspiration. If I got stuck and couldn't figure things out I would just sit here and play, or improvise. Sometimes for hours and hours, especially after Samantha was taken from us. In fact, I was playing this piece on this very piano when I figured out the key to making the machine work. When you were a kid, if you couldn't sleep, you'd always ask me to play this piece of music, which I'd improvised. And I'd play it, and you'd go to sleep, probably bored. Glad you made it, Sam. We have a lot to talk about. That is a go? Yep. Ready. The purpose of this thing is to see what we can achieve with, like, the MacGyver. Like, what do we have-- what are the tools around me, what can I do, you know. Uh, I can kind of imagined the title sequence ending with Finley Hart is-- has passed away. Ex-billionaire Finley Hart has reportedly passed away due to complications from kidney failure. His wife died while giving birth in 1992. He's survived by his sister, Rebecca, and his son, Samuel Hart. Again, our top story tonight, Finley Hart is watching us-- We're taking you on a journey to the-- Yes. You guys have like MTV Cribs here, so... Show me where Tony's gonna be sitting at a piano? Can you move in a little closer? - Right here, honey. - Yeah. That's great. - Is that what you want? - That's beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah. Love that. Yeah. Problem resetting, still rolling, one more time. Here we go. - Good morning, Ms. Schultz. - Morning. Next time you schedule a conference call at the crack of dawn for me, my hourly rate will double. ...moving objects, people. A device your father developed in secret. She said, uh, I lost connection. Can-- can-- can you guys hear me? Like-- that's-- let's pick something like that up to-- State your name, title, or former title for the group. Title? Uh, I don't have a title or position. Does somebody wanna tell me what the hell is going on here? I mean-- I mean, Chris, um, smaller with the eye movements as well, across the stream because when you turn your head, it looks like you're looking at, like, three different monitors. Standby... - Sorry. - We're just calling Ed right now, Stella, One quick second. Yeah. Hello? Are you calling... - So sorry. - Sorry. You hear something at the window, and you get up and take your phone with you. ...minutes to input. - Uh, where-- where is he going? - I'm just getting my water, if that's okay with you. Hakan, are you still with us? There's some lunatic here, staring into my window. And then, you hold up your iPhone, as if you're gonna film the guy. Who's that on the left of the screen? Who's that? - It's the writer right here. - Hi. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. I-- I hope I-- I didn't take too much liberty from your writing. It-- it can be scary if someone disappears, but we-- all of a sudden, the technology sends us to that room, and we don't-- But they're not there why is that? And then, just hear the sound coming in, and the sound going off. And then, that just becomes more scary, you know? I have this-- this thing going on. Oh, okay. Yeah. No, uh, no, you-- yes-- But across the mark, you wanna leave at zero. Supposed to be around 2,500 or less, if possible, but 2,500 should be... Placement of the security camera. Can we not just move that and, like, that angle Alex just showed us. Alex, turn your camera back to like what it would look like. That looks pretty awesome as a backdrop. God, I love this song. I've got... ♪ If you like piña coladas ♪ - ...in my head. - Oh, man. So, uh-- Oh, look at that. Tony's calling me, actually. Of course. I'll call him back after this. Um, so he's not in the room with you, is he? It's meant to with the GoPro is we can effectively, like, tape it to the top of a phone, and he can be-- And like, somebody can be on a Skype call with the other actors, but recording themselves with the GoPro. What is it? Call the Foundation. - Why? - It's not here. Call the Foundation. Do it right now. Riku, it's gone, it's empty. Look, it's empty. You want it up high? I really push it up. - Yeah. - Four feet higher than my head. Go. Ready, and-- Hey, Omar, come on, buddy. You did agree to it. No. I never agreed to that, and I never will. Tilt your laptop down so I can see the set a little bit? Like, if you-- okay. When they're in the box, and they get the card out there should be a QR code, so they have to pick up their phone, and scan the QR code, because that can be the reason to actually see what they're scanning, and see what it says. You know, we never see enough of the laptop to notice who it is. We just know that mother and daughter together, they usually go as one, she just asked if her daughter had a laptop. And I'm rerouting. Are you really married to an adult? What essentially we would wanna do, is we would score the 92 minutes, um, with a brain wave frequency matrix that would help to further enhance the emotion that's being captured on the screen, as you're going through different scenes. That was awesome. TJ killed it. I hope that water pipe's not gonna break now. Let's give it up for Alex, man. - Absolutely. - Yeah. Alex, man. You've killed it, dude. Riveting performance over Zoom. Oh, my God. Everybody can come off of their muted, uh, video screens here. And give it up for Jim for joining us, for having patience with us, and for knocking it out of the park. Really well done, sir. We'll cut it there. - Yay. - Great work. Great work. Wow. Yeah! Yeah, buddy! I will put the crown of-- of great performance back on your head, once that one's off. Oh hey. You as well, as we float down that long river... of all our happy yesterdays. Ta-ta. Bye-bye.
