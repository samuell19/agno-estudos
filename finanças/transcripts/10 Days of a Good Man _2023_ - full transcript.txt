Fuck you, don't pull me into this. You hear me? - [in Arabic] Who was it? - Shut up. [Vivaldi's "Summer" concerto playing] [thunder clapping and rumbling] [thunderclap] [frantic knocking on door] - [frantic knocking] - [cell phone ringing] [frantic knocking] DAY 1 [jazz playing] - [frantic knocking] - [ringing continues] [ringing stops] - [woman] Hello? Sadık? You there? - [knocking] Yes. I'm here, Maide. Hang on a minute. [frantic knocking] [frantic knocking] - Come in. - Good morning! [Sadık] Talk to me. [Maide] Can you come by the office today? Say, uh, two o'clock? - What time is it now? - Twelve o'clock. And don't be late. It's for a job. Okay, fine, I'll be there. Man, don't tell me you slept with your clothes on again. Ugh, Cemile. That whore just sent me another notice in the mail saying that she's gonna evict me. Think you could write up a reply that really bites her in the ass? [Sadık] Get yourself a lawyer. Why? Aren't you a lawyer? Your degree's right there in the cupboard. I swear that I wasn't snooping around. I just found it while I was cleaning up. I was a lawyer. And give me back your key. This movie again, man? It's not like I care, but who the hell is this guy? You always have this one on. Marlowe. He's another guy who talks to himself like I do. - Come on. - Hmm? Could you? Could you write it? Hm? Just leave it there. I'll look at it tonight. - [laughing] - Yeah, all right. Mm! Oh, you're the best! Do you know that? Huh? - You are the greatest guy in the world. - Mm-hm. [giggles] [door opens, closes] [suspenseful music playing] [elevator bell dings] [office phones ringing] Go on in, Sadık. Maide's ready for you. M ATTORNEYS AT LAW [laughing] Welcome! How are you? [music fades] - Other than you being cold, huh? - [chuckles] Yes, well, this one is quite personal. - You know about our twins. - [chuckles] We have someone to help us with them. Her name's Yeter, and she has a son. I even found him a job with Kibar Hayroş on the avenue as a hairdresser's assistant. Now he's disappeared. Missing a whole month. Police searched and put on a whole big number, but nothing. They came up empty-handed. [inhales, sighs] Maide, a month for a missing person, you know that's... I know, I know, I'm fully aware of the statistics. But... I mean, I just cannot go to that woman and say, "I'm sorry, Yeter, honey, but your son is probably dead." I just can't do that. So I need to help this woman and be doing something. [sighs] That woman's the foundation my life is built on. If she quits on me, that's it, I'll be ruined. Look, this is Lieutenant Şevket. And he owes us a favor. You call him, okay? For anything you might need. Hüseyin, my driver, is waiting for you downstairs to take you home. I want you to investigate for a week, and then after that, there isn't much else we can do. All good? All good. You know, Rezzan always used to say that you were a very smart guy. [Sadık chuckles] And I told Yeter you were smart. And a good guy. You're someone that could help us. [suspenseful music resumes] POLICE STATEMENT YETER HASANOĞLU [woman] Maide, bless her, sent both my daughter and my son to private school. But Tevfik couldn't graduate. Maide, she helped. Found work he could do so he wouldn't get recruited. With the famous hairdresser Hayroş to keep him in line. My son worked very hard. He was always either at work or at home. Was he recently... in a fight or anything? Arguing with someone? - Or something here at home? - No, no. Did he have a partner or... a girlfriend? No, he didn't. But my Nightingale has a generous heart. My boy. Maide told me that you were a really good man. - I can see that you are. - Mm. - These cookies are good. - Oh, thank you. - [doorbell chimes] - Oh, Hatice is here. My daughter. - [doorbell chimes] - [door opens] How many times do I have to tell you not to ring the bell over and over again? [exhales] Yeah, all right. - [door shuts] - [Hatice scoffs] [Hatice sighs loudly] [babies crying in background] See what you did? I'll be back after I calm them down. Ten minutes and I'm off to Zeliha's to study. - [Yeter] Don't go anywhere. Stay there. - [Hatice] I'll get back home on my own! - Hello, Hatice. - Pınar. Your mom just called you Hatice. Everyone's entitled to choose whatever name they want. Or does it have to be in the constitution? I see. So what's your thing? The good guy. Twice now I've been called that today. Hey, maybe I'll change my name. I'm gonna find your, um... look for your brother. [inhales sharply] Yeter's son, huh? Her little pet? Her shining star? [snickers] - What's so funny? - That naive bitch. Instead of snooping around and looking at my phone, she should have been checking her precious Nightingale's phone. Then she'd know all the shit he was doing. - Like? - The check-up parties. Your phone's nice though, with all that glitter. Very cute. [inhales sharply] Yeah, well, you might be good. But you like sticking your nose into everyone's business, don't you? [dish wobbles] [sighs] Energy. You know... for studying. Hmm. What the hell is a check-up party? [scoffs] No clue. Aren't you worried at all? It's your job to worry, good guy. Would you mind telling her Pınar has left to study? - What are you studying? - Physical education. [laughs] [door opens, shuts] Sorry, when one starts crying, the other starts up too. - My daughter took off, didn't she? [sighs] - Mm-hmm. I should head out too. - I need to report to Maide. - All right. - Please, take this. - What? Come on. I know this doesn't begin to cover your effort, but please take it. I'd give up everything for my son. [sighs] He's not the type to leave like this. He was saving money to take us all back to our hometown. [crying] Find him, please. All right. KAAN HOLDING TURN YOUR FACE TOWARDS THE FUTURE [suspenseful music playing] Physical education, huh? [Sadık chuckles] TAXI [car horn honks] [jazz playing] [Sadık] Wow. Really, Macit? Andante. One... two... three... four... Three thousand sixty-one. Three thousand sixty-two. Three thousand sixty-three. Three thou... Macit! Yoo-hoo! [music fades] S-Sadık... [chuckles] Hey, what are you doing here? No, no, don't worry. Maide didn't send me, man. I just need to ask your girlfriend here a few questions, that's all. And then you and I can catch up. Come here. Okay, now, tell me. - What? - The check-up thing. Look, all I know is check-up parties happen only on Thursday nights. I know that because of the messages on the Nightingale's phone. On Thursday nights, Tevfik would say that he had to work and that he was staying at the salon. Go and ask someone over there, like Kibar Hayroş, 'kay? Kibar Hayroş. Where is Tevfik's phone? How the hell would I know? It's wherever the Nightingale is! Don't look at me! This is my phone! You can ask Macit, okay? He got it for me, and that's the truth. Look, this won't end well. Take my word for it. I don't care! Leave me alone! Are you the police or something? It's none of your business! Just stay the good guy, and leave the evil to us. Your mom said no, but did Tevfik have a girlfriend, or at the parties... [laughing] [smooth jazz playing] Allegro. One... Two... Three. That's the welcome I get? [music fades] [woman] Hm. I give you Meral Çimen! [Sadık grumbles] Forgive me for coming in so late. But the party has just ended. What party? Meral Çimen's retirement party, of course. After 25 years, she's finally retiring from her glamorous drama career, and now, she's going to Eskişehir. [Meral sighs] [sighs groggily] Hurry and do what you need to do. I need to sleep. [laughing] We haven't done anything for two years, remember? Hmm. It's true. You're in this bed only 'cause it's so cold out. Hmm, besides... You can't leave your son. I know you love that mutt as if he were your child. You're really going to live in Eskişehir? Mmm, indeed. Rıza wants me there. [Sadık chuckles] He died ten years ago. Does he want you on the other side? His ghost wants me there. [strains] Hey, I've got an idea. Why... Why don't you come to Eskişehir too? I'll adopt you since you're... all alone. [Sadık chuckles] You're nuts. [whimpers] C'mere. [whimpers] [liquid pouring] [suspenseful music playing] DAY 2 [inaudible conversation] We never stayed the night on Thursdays. And I wasn't really friends with Tevfik, to be honest. He mention any health conditions to you? Or say, "Ali, I need to have a check-up," or anything like that? [tsks] Oh, there is one thing. Down a little further, there's a pharmacy across the street. It's called Simge. Yeah. He went there all the time. Maybe he was sick. Here, take this. 'Kay? And I'll also give you my number. Call me if you hear or see anything, or if you remember anything that could help. If you can help me out, there's more where that came from. - Do we have a deal? - Sounds good. [cell phone ringing] - Yes, Seval? - [Seval] Good morning, man. - You didn't come home last night. - I was busy. What's up? Something wrong? No, but that letter I need? You told me you'd work on it. That stupid Cemile thing, yeah? [chuckles] How about we work on that notice tonight? That sound good? All right, man. SİMGE PHARMACY [mysterious jazz playing] [plastic crinkling] - [man 1] Thanks so much. Have a good one. - [man 2] Hope you feel better soon. Hello, welcome. Can I help you? I need information on Tevfik. The... guy who works for Kibar Hayroş. I know you know him, Ahmet. They said he was a regular here. Yeah, I remember him. Errand boy for the hairdresser. He used to buy his meds here sometimes. - What kind of meds? - [chuckles] Well, I don't know, uh... Painkillers, antibiotics... Just everyday ones. Painkillers, not green prescription ones, right? Was Tevfik an addict? Green ones? We don't sell drugs without prescriptions. He bought simple meds. Why are you asking these questions? You're not police. Was he buying them for someone else? [chuckles] No, man, we're not on the same page here. Those green meds you're asking... Did he ever talk about a doctor or check-up? Allah, Allah! Quit it, will ya? Are you fucking with me? Does this look like a hospital to you? There's no check-up! And nothing illegal, if that's what you're implying. When did you see him last? A month, a month and a half ago. Happy now? - Go! - But I need a few things. Give me one of those. How much is it? Here, it's on me. Go. Go! What the hell was that all about? [suspenseful music playing] Good deal. You ask about a check-up, you get a toothbrush for free. I think you know something, Ahmet. - [laughs, gasps] - [cell phone ringing] Ah, old boy, seems like you're trying to tell me something. Hello? Hello? What the hell? [suspenseful music intensifies] [line ringing] [cell phone ringing] Don't make a sound. Just walk. Did Ahmet call you guys? Is this about the toothbrush? - Take it! What's going on? - Shut up. Get in. - Get in! - They're kidnapping me! NATIONAL ID SADIK DEMİR [man 1] Yes, sir. He's kind of strange. Looks harmless, though. He's not carrying. CLEANS THOROUGHLY Just a toothbrush. [saw whirring] [suspenseful music continues] [door closes] [hoarsely] Please... [groans] Eyes forward. [man 2] Hold him tight! Is this crystal-based? [man 3] Sir, I don't know! I swear, I don't! No! Don't do that, Sir. No, don't. Don't do it! Please no! - No, no! [screaming] - [sharp pounding] [screaming continues] That's no good. Just fucking cut these to the same size, idiot. [man 3 sobbing] So you're this Sadık guy. Aren't you? Huh? Oh wow, Hamza. You said he looked harmless and strange, but... I think he's funny. [laughing] Everybody here calls me Sir. And here's some advice from your superior. Unless you know a man's intention, don't shake his hand. - Maybe I'm about to cut your dick off. - [Sadık whimpers] So why are you being friendly, and ruining my fun? Huh? [Sadık gasps, sighs] Let's see what we have here. You're carrying... a toothbrush. Yeah, they had a promotion. It was free. [Sir chuckles] And then one... [chuckles] The hell is this? This thing's practically an antique. Yeah, but no PIN. I call that "old boy." - [chuckling] - It's still a smartphone. Old boy... [sighs] You make me laugh. You know... [inhales sharply] I also have names for my tools. For example, this one is Bulldog. A nail, a finger, a wrist, he just won't let go until he plucks them off. [wrench clatters] And then the fun's over. Tell me, how do you know Tevfik? Why are you looking for him? I don't know Tevfik. I've never actually met him. But he's been gone a month, and his mother's worried sick about him. And her name is Yeter, and I met her yesterday. And I have this attorney friend, sometimes I work for her on their cases, sometimes I do research. And this woman Yeter is babysitting Maide's children, - and she asked me to dig around, so... - Shh! [chuckles] [chuckling] [wheels squeaking] Did you get all of it? We did, Sir. Well? Start talking, Mister Detective Man. What have you figured out so far? Well, so far nothing, except for you guys. [Sir] Hm. Here's what we're gonna do, Mr. Sadık. If, by any chance, you do find a clue about Tevfik, the first thing you're gonna do... The first thing is give me a call. The fourth number here in your contact list is mine. Got it? How much is this Maide paying you? Uh, five grand. Oh, and Tevfik's mother gave me a bracelet of hers, but I'll give it back unless I find him. If you bring me something juicy, then I'll give you 20 grand. Take your stuff. Don't forget your weapon. [men straining] Whoa! [Sir] You're walking out of here in one piece. Not everyone's so lucky. I hope you appreciate that. [ominous music playing] [music fades] Ahmet the pharmacist... And then Sir... Oh, Tevfik. For heaven's sakes, how did a nice boy like you get mixed up with those two meatheads, huh? [sniffles] [sighs] Now... Could Ahmet the pharmacist and Sir both be in cahoots together? What do you think? [Sadık tsks] Nah, I don't think so either. I gave my number to Ali, the hairdresser's apprentice, who's in with Sir too. Ahmet, Ali, and Sir. What a mess. [sound of waves lapping] [Vivaldi's "Autumn" concerto playing] [woman] Sadık? Rezzan. [ominous droning sounding] [music halts] DAY 3 - [Rezzan] How wonderful! - [cork pops] [Maide laughs] Aww, thank you. Bless you both. Congratulations. Thank you. - He really has such amazing taste, huh? - [Maide] He sure does. No, none for me. Thank you though. Does that mean what I think it means? Are you...? - It's true. - [gasps] - I'm pregnant. - [Maide gasps] - [laughs] - [Maide] Aww! [soft piano music playing] [Maide] Congratulations! [chuckles] [music fades] [strains] [exhales sharply] [knocking] What? Oh man... [sobbing] This man who Mom says is my father, he just took away my phone and the money... all the money I sent her. And he said that he would burn it, and he won't let me talk to her. [sighing] So I guess I'm all by myself. [sobs] Are you working... uh... Are you going out today? [sighs] I mean, I could skip it. Why? [sobs] Okay, then. Go clean up, huh? We'll go to the notary and respond to the eviction notice. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. [sobbing happily] [Sadık grunts] But you need to wear something to cover your legs up, okay? - All right. [sniffles] - Hm. You know, you should wear something else too. We should get you a lighter coat. You always wear the same thing, summer or winter. [upbeat jazz playing] You got a little crush on me, don't you, man? [laughs] NOTARY Hey, thanks a lot, man. That was a really good response you came up with in there. Now that witch can't confront me anymore, and if she does, something tells me I'm just gonna pepper spray her in the face. [cell phone ringing] [Seval] Yeah, hi. No, I can't. Not tonight either. Cool it, Recep. I'm busy. How 'bout I buy you a coffee? Huh? Or better yet, maybe we could have dinner instead. - I make a great dinner. Uh-huh. - Hm. I have some things to do tonight. Coffee? Mmm! Oof! You are the greatest man I've ever known. [suspenseful jazz playing] Tempo grave. One... Two... Three... SİMGE PHARMACY Four... Ahmet, how the hell d'you disappear? [exhales] [music fades] DIAGNOSTIC HEALTH CENTER LONG-DISTANCE MOVERS - 115 CONSTRUCTION [Sadık] Seval, just do as I say, please. DIAGNOSTIC HEALTH CENTER All right, but it's just one text, that's all. Come on, I'm waiting. [cell phone chimes] Ah, yes, that's my girl. [intercom beeps] [woman] Can I help you? I need some tests done. We're closed. But Ahmet arranged the appointment A check-up, you know. [intercom crackles] Andante. - One... Two... - [mysterious jazz playing] Three... Four... [gasps] Well... Come in. Wait there. 'Kay. Keep going. Go on, this way. In. Frisk him, search him good. [hip-hop playing on stereo] Sadık Demir. Who the hell are you? What the hell do you want? Ahmet didn't tell you why I'm here? Look, man, here's how we're gonna do business together. This guy's gonna hold your arms down, this guy's gonna hold your mouth open, and I'm gonna take a shit down your throat, copy? [tsks] Don't like it. That's a shitty plan. Call Ahmet. [groaning] Wait! Look at the phone! Look at the phone! There's a text message there! [groans] This thing? It's an old model, but it works for me. [groans] There's no PIN, open it. "Lieutenant Şevket." "I'm here at Tani Medical Center on Hale Street." "Your guys can pick me up in half an hour." "On our way, Sadık." Who the hell is this lieutenant? Huh? Who is he?! Stop! His card's there, in my wallet! [groaning] [Sadık] That text was sent five minutes ago. You need to be quick. Call Ahmet. Come on. [Sadık panting] No, no... - [groans] - [man] Bring him in here! Easy, easy now! Oof... [suspenseful music playing] [woman speaking Arabic indistinctly] [overlapping chatter in Arabic] [men speaking Arabic] [men speaking Arabic] [man's voice echoes] [suspenseful music swells] [clattering] [in English] You are a fucking pain in the ass, you know that? [door shuts] How'd you find us? I've been following you since you left the pharmacy. You didn't see me? [in Arabic] Yes, it's true, there's a cop named Şevket. Lieutenant Şevket. [in English] Lieutenant Şevket. He works in the, uh, Special Enforcement Unit. His number's on there. [sighs] Out. - [door shuts] - [Sadık strains] Sadık? Better tread lightly here, my man. The police don't touch us. Or we wouldn't have survived this long. So out of my respect for Lieutenant Şevket, I'm going to let you off the hook this time. All right. But what if Lieutenant Şevket... [groaning] ...decides not to turn a blind eye? Then what happens, Ahmet? Human trafficking, prostitution, slave labor, maybe organ trafficking, among other things. Huh? You kidding? Listen. You... are gonna tell me all about this check-up thing, 'kay? And what dealings you've had with Tevfik. How he disappeared, where he's gone. You're gonna tell me about it, okay? What am I gonna do is pick up that phone, tell Lieutenant Şevket not to come here, that it's all okay. Got it? Ahmet, kid? I don't give a damn about whatever you're doing here. I'm just looking for Tevfik. I promised his mother I'd find him. Say you get what you're asking. Are you gonna keep buzzing around our ears? Nah. [blows] You listen up because I'm only gonna say this once. Don't be taken in by his looks. Your Tevfik was a sneaky little fucker. Working as errand boy for a hairdresser? That was just a front. [tsks] Clever. It was about a year ago. [Ahmet] He came here and started working for us. And for our line of business... [chuckles] ...that son of a bitch was quite the natural. He quickly rose to the rank of pimp. For the last six months, he'd come pick the good ones, and pimp them out. Then about a month ago, he took some of our merchandise. And we never saw him again. I tried to find him too. [tsks] But nothing. Oh, stop it, for God's sake. I know how old Tevfik was. How could that kid make it as a pimp? [Ahmet] Well, he had a partner. Every Thursday, Tevfik used to call us for a so-called check-up appointment. He'd come here in a black sedan with this guy Cevdet, who'd wait in the car while your boy would come, pick up the merchandise, and take her away. [Sadık] How do I find this Cevdet? I don't know that. Or him. [exhales] All right, Ahmet. [straining] This little story you've told me isn't going to stop me from buzzing around. There are a million Cevdets in Istanbul. Right? Oh, and by the way... You have ten minutes. [Ahmet snickers] [in Arabic] This prick won't quit. Do what he says. [Sadık sighs] [in English] Security cam footage. Get the license plate from that. [mouse clicking] That's more like it. [suspenseful music playing] Have a good one. Hello, Şule? I'm sorry to be calling you this late. It's kind of urgent. I'm going to read you a plate number, and I need to know who it's registered to. Sure, sure, of course I'll wait. Come on, you can do this, Şule. Find this dick. Today is Thursday. [music intensifies] [music fades] [man] Would you like some tea? - Delicious. - Thanks. Who are you dealing with, Ahmet? [car door shuts] Who's in the car? Damn. [exhales in frustration] So amateur, Sadık, amateur! If it was Marlowe, he'd be in his car and on their tail. [sighs] Hey, man. Another small one. Thanks. [Hamza] They haven't touched him. His nose and mouth are all intact. He's sitting there eating meatballs, checking out anyone coming and going. Right. [inhales sharply] I got it. It's no problem. I'll take care of him, okay? Never mind Meral, okay? You are not my son. I found you on the street, and I don't know your mother. Okay? [whining softly] [cell phone ringing] Hello, Maide. - Good morning, Sadık. - Good morning. - How are you? - I'm good. How about you? How'd you like to have lunch with me? What do you say? - You mean today? - Yes. - That's weird. - Why d'you say that? Well, I'm just surprised, you know, with this Tevfik thing... - I should be off by 1:30. Let's say 2:00. - Well, okay, where? - Do you know Sera? - Yeah, yeah, I do. All right. - Great, I'll see you then. - 'Kay. [exhales] Have you found out what your husband's up to? TO SEVAL CAN'T MAKE IT. BUSINESS LUNCH. Sphinx, come on. Do what you have to do. I can't wait all day. Hey! Come on! Suit yourself. [soft jazz playing] DAY 4 [Sadık] Thank you. [exhales] - [server] Welcome. - Thank you. What would you like? Uh, whiskey, neat. Sure. - And I'm waiting for someone. - Understood. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... - Great. Thank you. - [server] Enjoy, sir. Thirteen... Two hundred sixty... Two hundred sixty-one... [Rezzan] Hello, Sadık. [Sadık coughing] Are you okay? [continues coughing] [sighs] [exhales] Sure been a little while, you know? Six years, five months, 13 in prison, 77 months total. Yeah, that is a while. How are you? I'm sure that Maide's told you how I am. [laughs softly] Sure has. [sighs] Are you feeling all right? I mean, you're... You're not dressed for the weather. My stomach is... - Shall we order something? - No. Thank you. Aren't you going to ask me how I am? But I already know how you are. You're doing well. I get my monthly briefings. - Maide reports? - [Sadık tsks] Society gossip rags. [chuckles] You know, all those trendy magazines showing where you guys go, on whose yacht and with who, and what you eat, what you wear, who fucked who, who tried but couldn't fuck who... And all with nice color photographs, of course. That's the source. So you read that kind of stuff now, do you? My neighbors. Your neighbor's a lady, then. She is. Is she pretty? Let's say beauty's worth money in her industry. Are you still angry with me? [laughing] You're getting ahead of yourself with that. [chuckles] I can remember thinking you were a better person than you actually turned out to be. You see this? I need to drink a whole of bottle of that in one big gulp. Sadık, I'm grateful. Really, I am. Seriously. I'm grateful to you for everything you did for me. Wow, that thank you was a long time coming. - It took seven years for it to get here. - [sighs] I was just too ashamed to. Oh yeah? [laughing] So, tell me. What's the reason for your change of heart? [inhales sharply] Sadık, there's another case. They're filing another lawsuit. Okay? And it could result, if I'm convicted, in my disbarment. Okay. [somber music playing] I can't go to prison, Sadık. I mean, not even for a few months. It's impossible. I'm pregnant. [voice echoes] And no one's ever loved me as much as you. I need a cigarette. Excuse me. [sniffles] [sniffles] JUSTICE IS THE BASIS OF THE STATE [dramatic orchestral music playing] [gavel strikes] [music fades] Welcome home, man. - I have a surprise for you. - [Sadık sighs] Why are your eyes all red? Is something wrong? It's allergies. The trees and the pollen. - How 'bout a glass and some ice, please? - Yeah, sure. So who'd you have to meet today, man? Who'd you have lunch with? [glasses clinking] Give me that magazine of yours. February issue. [Sadık strains] REZZAN AKKURT SUCCESSFUL, GORGEOUS AND HEALTHY She's quite pretty. So who is she? [Sadık exhales] Ex-wife. Did you use to be rich or something, man? [chuckles, tsks] Her new husband's rich. [chuckles] Was she the one who hurt you? Why did you get divorced? She and I were partners. She's an attorney as well and we worked together. One day on a case, some shit went wrong, and I took the fall. [inhales sharply] I was disbarred and then sentenced to prison. She left me and married a rich guy. [chuckles, sighs] [sniffles] She didn't wait for you, huh? I would have waited for you. I promise you that. So what does she want? [chuckles] A favor. Why are you closing your eyes? I just said a prayer. [laughs] You said you had a surprise, right? [laughs] Yes. Two, in fact. - I'll be right back. - [Sadık] Okay. [cell phone ringing] [sighs] Yes, Maide? [Maide] Look, I know tricking you like that was uncalled-for. I'm sorry, but I had to do it. When Arif told me that Rezzan was pregnant... I mean... Damn. Are you mad at me? Maide... [inhales] Put yourself in my shoes, for once. Imagine your husband does some shady work, you do time for him. While you're locked up, your husband divorces you and marries another woman. And seven years after that, this is the best part, someone like me acts as a mediator, and your ex-husband comes to see you, and asks the very same thing of you... Go to prison again. How would you feel, Maide? [inhales] You'd be a little pissed off too. You have every right to feel the way you do. I'm the messenger in this situation. Arif would be willing to do absolutely anything that you ask him to if you could just voluntarily take the blame for this. Maide, what am I worth? Hm? How much, Maide? What do you take me for, huh?! [grumbles] Hey, what's wrong? [upbeat jazz playing] [Seval] What is it, man? [breathing heavily] There is a God out there. It was only, like, five minutes ago that I asked him about you. [breathing heavily] [music fades] [breathing rapidly] Wait! Wait. Wait. I promise I didn't say anything to him. I'm telling the truth... [soft footsteps] [Vivaldi's "Summer" concerto playing] - [music distorts, halts] - [gasps] Good morning. [Sadık groans softly] I quit working for Recep. If I have to, I'll take housecleaning jobs. [laughs] This was the third surprise. DAY 5 [upbeat jazz playing] [Sadık] Still no deliveries yet. [music fades] [man] What'd you say? You need something? No, I'm just waiting to have some tests done there. [man] You're having tests? You oughta steer clear of that place. There was just a murder there. A murder? What happened? This guy who came here all the time. Ahmet, I think his name was. He was shot. The landlord told me. Understood. Cevdet strikes again. [cell phone ringing] What'd you find, Şule? [Şule] Your license plate came back. It's registered as one of a fleet of vehicles that was rented out six months ago by Kaan Incorporated. But here comes the interesting part. The car was totaled in an accident 20 days ago. They couldn't identify the driver because he had crossed into the opposite lane, crashed head-on into a tanker truck, and his body was burned to a crisp. The car was assigned at the time to the company's chief security officer. Uh, it was a black sedan. - Do you have a name for me? - Cevdet Koru. [Şule sighs] Looks like he was shady. Before he was discharged for gambling and assault and battery, it seemed like he was actually working as a deputy police lieutenant. Almost hard to believe, right? They all think he's got to have been the driver 'cause it so happens he's gone missing since the day the accident happened. All right, Şule, do we have an address, maybe for where he works or lives? Just the address of the place his wife, Kadriye, moved to. Okay, can you text me that? Ah, and please send Hüseyin. So Ahmet's been killed. And I was pretty sure you did it, but now... [inhales] We'll see. We'll see. [somber jazz playing] [doorbell chimes] Two... Three... Four... Yes? Can I help you, sir? I'm with Long Life Insurance Company. Sadık Demir. Um, first, sorry for your loss. Um, I've come here today to talk about Mr. Koru's life insurance payment. Uh, are you his wife? [woman] My brother-in-law had a life insurance policy worth 2 million. - [Sadık] Mm. - And that was paid by his employer. His company had a housing benefit package for those who lost their lives on the job, but Tahsin didn't say anything about an insurance policy. Who's Tahsin? He was the HR manager. Ah. Or maybe it's the HR coordinator. [laughs] I can't really remember. But I know I have his card here somewhere. He left it when he came with the title deed. [Sadık] Hmm. Thanks. You don't know Tahsin? No, we only deal with the finance department. Hmm. He brought the title deed to you himself, huh? Seems your brother-in-law was well liked. [woman laughs] There was also a satchel that Cevdet had here with some documents about the company in it. He wanted to get that too. - Ah. - Mm-hm. Well, regarding the other thing... Uh, there are one or two questions. - When is your sister back from Adapazarı? - Day after tomorrow. Also, just to make things quicker, may I ask for her phone number? Uh, your sister's. Of course. [suspenseful music playing] [car engine turns over] You talked too much again, Behiye. Why'd you tell him all that stuff? And why'd you give him the card? [Behiye] Stop it, sis. Tahsin, pal. You're a big-time executive and coordinator, working for a big corporation that owns half the country. [Sadık] So, why would you come to them to hand over the title deed yourself? Ah! Unless... Maybe you had something else in mind. Tahsin, buddy... TAHSIN GÖLLÜ PR COORDINATOR What was in that satchel? Mr. Sadık, it's Maide. She's been calling you, but you haven't answered. What is it, Maide? [Maide] Hi, what are you doing? Nothing much, just thinking. - About Arif's offer? - [laughs] No, about the Syrian immigrants. The slaves. Moving to Eskişehir. Whether I should go and live on a tropical island or not. There are just so many things on my mind. Shall I keep going? What about Rezzan? No. Tevfik comes first. I'm trying hard to earn that 5,000. Forget about Tevfik for now. Wouldn't you like to at least hear the details of Arif's offer? Is he there? No. But I can call him if you're going to be here. This is the fifth day. Our deal was to talk again after a week, wasn't it? I'll come in then. And I'll tell you what I found and even what I couldn't find. All right? Ah. And by the way... Don't give my greetings to Arif. [dramatic orchestral music playing] [music fades] [Seval] Who is it? Me. Here. Put this on it. And keep it there till it hurts, okay? I thought it was you. [sniffles] He jumped me. [sobs] [Sadık] It's because you told him you won't be working anymore, right? I need you to give me this Recep's phone number and the license plate of his taxi. You'll get hurt. He's got a partner. [sniffles] And they have the contract I signed. 'Kay. Get some rest. All right. [knocking] [knocking] Sir sends you his regards. Here are the two, and here's the girl's contract. Thank you for this. [Hamza's man] Move it! [Hamza] Sir asks that you appreciate this favor, and get back to work without wasting any more time. Just so you know. [door opens] [Seval] What happened? The Recep thing's sorted. I got your contract. It's on the nightstand. How'd you do that? [Sadık chuckles, inhales] I know some people. Get some sleep. I don't think I'm gonna call you "man" anymore. Sadık. All right. My name's Fatma. I like Fatoş better though. [Vivaldi's "Spring" concerto playing] [Seval, in Turkish] ♪ I won't look for you In faraway places ♪ ♪ Because you're in my heart ♪ DAY 6 ♪ Sitting on a throne ♪ ♪ Occupying my best part ♪ [cell phone ringing] Who the hell? Who's this? [suspenseful music playing] Whoa! Mister Good Guy! And you actually bought some new clothes. What's up with that color? Oh, please don't say cat's got your tongue. Go on, talk. You're the one who should talk. What's this big thing you wanted to say? What if I said I have a certain phone with juicy videos, photos, and texts on it that's for sale for a limited time? Interested? I thought you didn't have Tevfik's phone. You liar. - Slipped my mind. - Yeah, right, like hell it did. How do I know you're not lying to me again? I have five photos and a few messages that I transferred from Tevfik's phone onto mine. Check 'em out. If you want the phone, bring me 20,000 lira. And I know, you don't have that much cash. - But Macit does. - Macit, huh? He thinks Maide's the one who sent you after him. He's practically shitting his pants now. Without Maide, Macit'd be starving. Right now, he'd give you anything short of his life. God, this is ridiculous. - Wait, aren't you and Macit a thing? - [laughs] Oh, that's a good one, old man! Please. He'd drop me like that if he found a better personal trainer than me. Our thing is just... mutually beneficial. [sighs, chuckles] There are some threatening texts on there, from someone named X. - Do you know who that could be? - [playful murmur] First the money, good guy. - Hi. Bottle of milk, please. - [vendor] Hello. Yes, sir. - How much is it? - Seven lira. [dramatic orchestral music building] NO WORD ABOUT THE MISSING GIRL IN THREE MONTHS! [vendor] Sir? Your milk. [music fades] The money's not for me. It's... for a mother. Are you still after me? No, I don't care what you do. And don't worry, I didn't tell Maide anything. Then why not ask Arif for the dough? His Russian skimming sure came through. Was it Rezzan who introduced Maide to Arif? [chuckles] She was his attorney in both divorces. And she got him off with virtually no alimony. So, yeah, they go way back. Oh, and one word of advice. Be wary of Pınar. She's underage, so if she tried to do anything, it'd cost more than this. [laughs] You think I'm a rookie womanizer who doesn't know enough to get insurance, Sadık? I make sure to always acquire the goods to ruin any girl I get with well before they're underneath me, my friend. [Sadık chuckles] The PIN is his birth year, then the first two numbers again. Two thousand, two-two-oh. Macit's who taught him that. Open his chats and you'll see every message. ENTER PIN Why are you doing this? Look, pops, getting an education in this town is expensive. Clothes, accessories, they all cost money. You see those morons at that table all hoping to fuck me? Look at the shoes they wear. That brand? The cheapest pair is two grand. And don't get me started on the watches. Now just give me that fucking envelope. [rapping on glass] [ominous music playing] [door shuts] [music fades] [Sadık] Cevdet. "Check-up tomorrow." X. "I missed you." "Haven't you missed me?" "Why don't you reply?" "Where are you?" "Don't get on my nerves. You know I could hurt you if you do." "My property can't fool around." "What I own must always be at my disposal." Who are you, X? This talk of property and ownership... You sound like a macho man. What if I called you now? Would you even tell me who you are? Maybe. Huh? I shouldn't do that? Fine, help me out here, then. [cell phone clicks] Now... This Cevdet guy and Tevfik have been going to Ahmet every Thursday for the last six months, picking up the orders and taking them somewhere. Question one. Why only Thursdays? Because the pimping activities can only happen on Thursdays? [snaps fingers] Right. 'Cause they have only one customer. Question two. Who is this customer? It's gotta be either related to Cevdet, or the Kaan Corporation. Hmm. Although this Mr. X uses a vulgar tone in his texts. It's different to those who work at Kaan. [ominous music playing] Wow, Tevfik. You really are full of surprises, aren't you? [chuckles] [dramatic musical stinger plays] Oh shit! [music fades] I was just about to... call Sir. Thanks. [cell phone ringing] [ringing continues] [ringing continues] [ringing continues] [techno music sounding over phone] [Pınar] Hello, pops! What's up? Have you found anything fun on the phone you paid 20,000 for? Why aren't you talking, good guy? I think I'll just wait for you to spill the beans. - Where are you, huh? - Where I am is none of your business. But now you've seen who Yeter's Nightingale really is, haven't you? - Hey. - Get outta here. Take a good look at the phone in your hand, and you'll see it's got two calculators on it. The one that's black is the Nightingale's coded safe for his secret stuff. I'm gonna send you a sample video. Put me on speaker. I have. [woman whimpering, screaming] [Pınar] The rest of this video will knock your socks off. [woman's whimpering continues] [laughs] Crazy, huh? Maybe I could give you the girl too, huh? [giggling] Only this time, the price will be 30,000. Macit would never pay me again. [laughs] You'll figure it out! [music halts] [exhales] Hey, Macit. Yeah, it's me again. Listen. Uh, about your girl Pınar. She owes me a little something that I'm having trouble collecting. So... Yeah, yeah, send me those photos. Okay. Maide won't hear about it, no. ALL ABOUT ZANZIBAR SADIK DEMİR How do you write about these island trips without going there? [upbeat jazz playing] I've seen them all. In my dreams. [both laughing] You're crazy. Why is it that every place has hot weather? I'm always cold, that's why. Oh, so that's why you're always wearing that jacket. You won't be cold from now on. You have me. - Come. - [chuckles] [cell phone ringing] Who's calling you so late? Meral. - Yes, Meral? - [Meral] Oh, Sadık! Our son is dead! [Meral] For what pain? What affliction? What disgrace is there that Zeus has not made us taste? Why did she call the dog your son? [Meral] None shall mourn for him. - There will be no tears. - One day, about three years ago... I was wandering around here and the dog followed me home. - Meral fell in love right away. - [Meral] And now... - And just like that, we adopted him. - Now is the time for today's declaration. Do you hear it? Do you heed it? Well, um, how much longer? [chuckles] Not much longer. She'll forget the words soon. Her memory's shot. She hasn't acted for years. [Meral sighs] Come on. Let's go get a drink. Come. [Seval sniffles] [Seval sighs] So tell me, pretty girl. How much do you love my boy? - You mean the dog? - [Meral and Sadık chuckle] - No, I meant this guy. - [Seval chuckles] DAY 7 [Sadık] Pınar! Oh! Good guy, hm? You're waiting for me now, I see. Okay. And? You have my money? What's on this is more important than money. [ominous music playing] Hey, sit down. Come here. I'll take that. Come on, sit down. There. [breathing rapidly] You okay? [sniffling] You said I should leave the evil to you, but here you are crying. Not so tough, huh? See, this is what happens when you get in over your head. - You thought you'd seduced Macit... - I seduced Macit? You think you know absolutely everything. You think you're the only good guy out of a world full of bad guys! Well, you're wrong, okay? Please, I didn't seduce that prick! That sweet, innocent Tevfik you're so eager to find sold me to him! Sold his own sister, one weekend in a house in... Stop, stop, stop! Come on, stop! All right, enough. I don't wanna hear it. - I'm sorry. - Forget about it. [crying] Hey, wait a sec! Don't worry about this. Okay? I'll deal with it. In exchange for what? It's on me. Hey, good guy. Zero-two-twenty. [sniffles] [ominous music intensifies] [sharp banging sounding in video] [woman screaming in video] Who the hell are you? [screaming continues] [laughter] [ringing] You and I need to talk, Macit. What, you're out of money already? Try Arif, then. Shhh. Easy now. Wouldn't want to cause a scene with these classy friends of yours. You were born in '79, right? So, one-nine-seven-nine, one-nine. I know all about your little PIN system. [phone unlock click] Pınar told me. Turns out you already knew what kind of guy Tevfik really was. [inhales sharply] And I know what you did to her in Polonezköy. [laughs] Tevfik is listed as "Queen." [chuckles] Why Queen? Let's see what else we have here. Ah... Lieutenant Cevdet. It says "lieutenant." You knew him before he was discharged from the force. Six or seven years ago? This is ridiculous. Go get your kicks with Arif, not with me. Talked to Şule too. We go way back. Turns out you're Cevdet's gambling partner. And Maide was his attorney on a few cases. Was it you that got him hired over at Kaan? Listen to me, you cuckold wannabe detective. Better get the fuck out of here now or I'll have you thrown out on your ass. I don't give a damn about your stupid threats. Get lost. Tell Maide whatever the hell you want. I'm sick of your shit. All right, you've made your bed, then. Take a look at this. That guy you see there engaged in a physical education session with Tevfik? [man moans on video] His name is Sir, or at least that's what they call him. A peculiar, international mobster kinda guy. You can see his tastes are... a little different. Ah. And he has this weird tool, but not the kind you're thinking of. An actual tool, really weird thing. He does really weird things to people. Anyway, we're friends. He's looking for Tevfik too. If you don't want to talk to me, then maybe you'll talk to Sir. And now that I have your attention, I have some questions. Did you introduce Tevfik to Cevdet? Two years ago in Beyoğlu, there was a raid on this bar. And I called Cevdet so Tevfik wouldn't get arrested. Are you two still in contact? You and Cevdet? You didn't know? He died like a month ago. And what happened to Tevfik? How the hell would I know? You think I keep tabs on everyone in my contacts? All right. You need to watch one more thing. [woman screaming on video] You know those two, don't you? They must be some creeps from Kaan Corporation. [screaming continues] [Sadık] I suppose I could ask Maide. But getting you to talk is much easier. Who are they? Huh? [Macit sighs] Or Sir could ask you. [inhales, sighs] It's gotta be them. Kaan's bizarre twins. They have always been weird. Good. That stuff on your phone, about Pınar, that you told me was your insurance policy? Delete that. Video, photos, whatever. Hm? Go on. Be careful too 'cause I'm gonna check. [inhales sharply] And order me one of those. [upbeat jazz playing] Sadık! Didn't I warn you? - That Seval woman has... - Whoa, whoa! She's my fiancée, watch it. Ha! Fiancé, huh? Birds of a feather! If she's your fiancée, then go get married! And get the hell out of my flat, the two of you! She's been turning tricks! [Sadık strains] - Did she recite instead of praying again? - Uh-huh. - And did she forget the words? - I don't know. I didn't stay that long. [knocking on door] [knocking] Can we talk for a minute? That's your neighbor who needed your help? [Sadık murmurs] And I hear you're engaged. The lady downstairs told me. [inhales sharply] She's a bit, uh... [laughs] No, more than a bit. Isn't she too young for you? Depends on how you look at it. I mean, she is retired. I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke. What line of business is she, uh... retired from? Prostitution. It's recent. In the last few days. [chuckles] That was a long silence. Seven. Seven seconds. So you still count. I do. I just couldn't... kill my inner child. Couldn't do it. It's a girl, Sadık. Like you and me always wanted. Back then. Sadık, if you save me from going to prison, if you do this for me, then that girl will be born. Arif has it figured out. That's why I came. Our attorneys want me to put the blame entirely on you when I'm called up to give testimony. Making sure to point out your previous confession. Come on, cut the bull. I wanted to have a daughter, not you. I'm sorry for smoking. [Rezzan sighs] What do you say? Come on. What do you say? Have you learned nothing from what happened? You're none the wiser? Seriously? Arif is prepared to be generous. Well, look how lucky you are. Your ex-husband's a good guy, and your current one is generous. It's just pathetic. [Rezzan scoffs] You're living in a cave. [chuckles] Worn-out old furniture. The smell. The moisture. How can you live here like this? Why do you do this to yourself? - This opportunity... - I'm happy where I am. Most nights I dream. You know, tropical islands, places that are warm. I'm surrounded by lots of good people. You mean like retired prostitutes? Her name's Fatoş. She's the most honest person I've ever known. She never betrays the one she loves. Her prostitution involved only her body. What about yours? [sniffles] [frantic knocking at door] [knocking] - Sadık. Just please. - [Sadık scoffs] - Listen, I just want to try and help... - Maide! Mind your own business, please. Just... talk to your cheating husband. Go and ask your Macit if he's having fun at his bachelor pad. Everyone will hear about it soon anyway. Go on. [soft jazz playing] [seagulls squawking in background] So we're getting married, huh? [both chuckling] - That Maide woman told me. - Hmm. - Cemile told her. - Mm-hm? [Sadık chuckles] - I have a question. - Mm. [inhales sharply] If I wasn't... Well, I mean, you know... Would you have really wanted to get married to me? [strains] Hey. Regardless of whether you're that or you're not... [Seval laughs] We're engaged now. [Seval laughs] You are now my princess. You know that TV show that you watch? - Uh-huh? - Just like that. [both laughing] I'm off birth control. [seagulls squawking] [ship's horn blowing] [music fades] DAY 8 [cell phone ringing] [Sadık] Hello, Mr. Tahsin. This is Sadık Demir. I'm an attorney. I'd like to talk to you about something. [man] Tahsin's away on leave. This is Nuri. What's this about? It's about Bilge and Kamil Kaan. Whoever told you you could talk to them on this number was wrong. Tell the twins that this is about Cevdet Koru and Tevfik Hasan, okay? Go to hell, you stupid motherfucker. I'll tell you how it's gonna be, then. I'm sending over a video and I'll be waiting for your response, but I don't have much time. You have two hours, okay? Piece of shit. [phone clatters] [woman screaming on video] - Looks good. Thank you. - Enjoy. [phone chimes] TAHSİN GÖLLÜ TEXT ME YOUR LOCATION [ominous music playing] [Nuri] Kamil, sir, sorry to bother you. An attorney named Sadık just called Tahsin's company number. And he sent a video. - Mr. Tahsin. - He called from Tevfik's phone. - [Kamil] What does he want? - [Nuri] To meet with you. Straight down on the left. - [woman] Welcome. - [music fades] [chuckles] I'm Bilge. And this is Kamil. We're a little sensitive to light. And you are Sadık Demir. Can we offer you anything? Whiskey? Rum? - Vodka? - Vodka's good. [Bilge] They said you wanted to talk to us... about Tevfik. Yes, I thought you might know something about him. - Here's your vodka. - Thank you. Aren't the two of you working together? What do you mean? Who am I working with? The video that you sent to Nuri was sent from Tevfik's phone. Ah. No, I'm not working with Tevfik. In fact, I've never even met him. I got his phone by coincidence. And the videos. [distant ship's horn blowing] [Sadık exhales] Here's what I think. Cevdet and Tevfik were blackmailing you two using these videos, right? And you wanted them out of the picture. But I really don't care about any of that, okay? I'm just interested in Tevfik, in finding him. - His mother's worried about him. - [both laughing] Sadık, please. You have got the whole thing all backwards. Ah, same as you, we've been looking everywhere for our little devil. [liquid pouring] Tell me, Sadık, what's the one thing you desire the most? I don't know... Maybe to go and live on a tropical island. [Kamil] Then find our devil. You got lucky finding his cell phone. Certainly you can bring him to us too. That's assuming he's still alive. [Bilge] But if you thought he was blackmailing us, we can assume you must think he's still alive. [Kamil] Come. Follow me. Look, we love hunting. Siberian bear. There, that goat is from the Taurus Mountains. It's friendship with danger... Strolling along the edge of a cliff... It means being utterly fearless. What do you think comes after fear? [inhales] You were going to say terror, but I mean beyond that too. The purest pleasure. To reach that level, you need to walk over your greatest fear. You see, this is the riddle that we've been trying to solve. Keep that in mind. Deliver Tevfik to us, and that tropical island is yours. [ominous music playing] [cell phone ringing] What's up, Pınar? [Pınar] Sadık, my mom wants to talk to you. - [Yeter] Hello, Sadık? - I'm here, Yeter. You don't need to look for Tevfik anymore. Why not? Have you heard something? No, but I had a dream about him. My son is in a place like heaven. Beautiful girls all around him. He's at peace, with a halo over his head. So let's not disturb him. Thank you so much for your time. [Pınar] Hey, pops, me again. - Kid, what's going on? - Yeter's gone completely crazy! A couple of hours ago she came home and told everyone that we're going back to our village. Now she's packing! I'm not moving to a freaking village! I'm not going! I'm not! All right, take your mother's phone. Uh, then send me all her incoming calls starting from three days ago. 'Kay? Bye. I don't work for you anyway, Yeter. I have two new clients. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! The nerve of that two-face! I need to get rid of that Macit. I'm gonna dump his ass so fast! Sadık, tell me what to do, you know, like you used to do back in college. Show me a way. [breathing rapidly] Hey, what's up? Wait. Wait a sec. What's up? You do have something that will help me out of this mess, don't you? Maide? How much is it gonna cost you to divorce this guy? Three, five million? Maybe more? Huh? - [Maide sighs] - All right. I can find a few photos that'll help you. Oh, that's great, that would be so amazing. Although... I have to charge for 'em. Uh, 300,000. Send the money to my place with Hüseyin tomorrow. All right? Tomorrow? Maide. You're always so generous. Thanks. [dramatic string music playing] [thunderclap] [heavy rain pattering] [engine revving] [Sadık groans] [groaning] [sighs] [music fades] Damn you, Macit, was this your doing? [inhales, exhales] Nah, he wouldn't. This guy almost killed me. Though it could've been the twins. [chuckles] That Nuri guy definitely didn't like me. - Oof. - [cell phone chimes] "Tomorrow morning at 11:00. These are the numbers." Good job, Pınar. Let's see who these numbers belong to. Kadriye? Cevdet. Urging Yeter to stop looking for Tevfik. [dramatic music swells] Of course! You would have figured this out in two minutes. Of course. [door opens] [Seval] Come in. Oh! Sadık's here too. - [Meral] Yoo-hoo! Hello! We're home! - [door closes] - Ah! - We brought Meral's things from her place. She's going to stay with us till she goes to Eskişehir. We're never here anyway. And we did some shopping. I heard it's cold there. [Sadık] Meral Çimen. How can I help you, mister? Would you go on stage one last time and play the secret lover? [dramatic string music continues] DAY 9 Let's go. - So when can I withdraw it? - As soon as you turn 18. Ooh! That's pretty soon. [Pınar inhales sharply] You're penniless, and you're still giving all the money to me. Good guy? You're more like a really gullible guy, pops. [sighs] [tense orchestral music playing] [lock clicking] [breathing rapidly] [sighs] [tapping foot nervously] [Sadık] Tempo grave. [rapid breathing continues] One... Two... [woman] Come on. [hurried footsteps] [music intensifies] [woman] Miss Meral? Are you here? It's Kadriye. We spoke on the phone. Anybody home? [tense music building] [music swells, fades] Well, hello there. Just as I expected. Get this guy! [Sadık gasps, pants] [panting] - [Hamza] Hey, open up! Open the door! - [pounding on door] I just wanna talk. Open up. - [Sadık] Okay, I'm coming out. - [Hamza] Hands in the air. - [pistol cocks] - Oh fuck! [screams, groans] [Hamza] My eyes! I'm gonna rip you a new one, you fucker! [Hamza yells in pain, groans] - [Sadık panting] - [music fades] [Hamza thudding] [groaning] Fucker. [Hamza groaning] Does Sir know about them, huh? That asshole Tevfik. He was playing all of us. [groans] He's the one who opened the safe. What did you take out? Fifty thousand euros. And... the invoices for all the smuggled cars. - Nothing else? - [Hamza panting] I swear, man. I just did what Tevfik told me to. The money is in my car. Here. Just please take it all. You're lucky this is my friend's apartment. Otherwise, I would leave you here to bleed to death. - [pained breathing] - [Sadık] Sir will find you anyway. His Bulldog'll get you soon. Stand, stand! [straining] [Kadriye sobbing] [Kadriye sniffling and crying] [sobbing] - How'd he talk you into this? - [sniffling] He used to beat me a lot. Him? [gasps] Cevdet. You really found a way to fool everybody. [Kadriye sobbing] [Sadık] What'd he tell you? Did he tell you when Cevdet was out of the picture, you were gonna elope? [sobbing] [Sadık] Let me tell you something. You know that fancy sister of yours, Behiye? I bet he got to her too. So she could help eliminate you, mark my words. Did he tell you to sell the house? [Sadık laughs] I knew it. I knew it. [Kadriye sobbing] [chuckles] Now, Kadriye. I'm gonna let you go now, okay? And you're gonna forget about what happened, and you're gonna disappear. Because this little devil has a monstrous mob hot on his tail. Sell your house, take your kids, and, you know, move to Adapazarı, okay? Go now, go. [whimpering] [door opens] [door shuts] [Sadık sniffles] [Sadık] So Yeter's little Nightingale has nothing to say, huh? Come on, everyone's gone. We're alone here. Speak. Where is she? - Where's who? - Cevdet's sweetheart. The one who called Kadriye and told her she knew everything. You're talking about Meral. A very successful stage actress. - Wait, so that was all just pretend? - Yes, idiot. - Now, tell me. - Sadık, I have a lot of money. Unless there is... [inhales sharply] ...something else that you want. [pistol cocks] Nothing says goodbye quite like a bullet. Let's hear it. Both twins are maniacs. Trust me. They're insane. And that Kamil is just sick. He's obsessed with something he calls pure pleasure, and he won't listen to anybody. So I secretly recorded one of their little rituals. [ominous music playing] [Tevfik] They'd never gone that far before. They left their merchandise in bits and pieces. So then it was up to Cevdet and his guys to cover it up. But Cevdet decided to leave some loose ends. He kept the blade they used. The blade had fingerprints on it, obviously. [scoffs] Yeah. And of course, you figured why split the blackmail money with Cevdet? [Sadık] But how did you eliminate Cevdet? [Tevfik] Easy, thanks to Kadriye. She was so desperate that she was ready to do anything I told her. A few drops of sedative into his drink just before he hits the road, and then... - [tires screeching] - Crash. [police walkie-talkies beeping] [Tevfik] Then Kadriye finished the blackmail Cevdet started. She got the money and the house. [Sadık] Why did you even need Kadriye? You could have just taken the blade blackmailed 'em yourself. [Tevfik] It was too risky for me. But since hubby dearest was an employee at the corporation, they were nervous about messing with Kadriye. Yeah, and you would get the house and the money. Cunning. I would've if it hadn't been for you. That so? - And Ahmet? - That's on you. [Tevfik] You were getting too close to me. [on phone] I don't want you to go near that Sadık guy. We don't know who he is or what he does. What if he's involved with the police? [Hamza] Right. [Tevfik] They just let him go? They haven't touched him. His nose and mouth are intact. Hamza boy. Honey. Just deal with Ahmet, okay? [car engine revving] So you've met Sir. Uh-huh. Everyone looking for you knocks on my door, so yeah. If you hadn't interfered, I would've known what Sir was up to 'cause Hamza was my inside man. And when Hamza wasn't any use to you anymore, you'd just kill him as well? It's your turn. How'd you figure it out? Your mother. That woman took the bracelet off her own arm and gave it to me. Just so I would find you. So when she wanted me to stop, I had to ask why. Who could make her give up on this? Her son. The rest was too easy. Pınar. That sister of yours? The one you pimped out. You know, her? She gave me the last numbers that called your mom. And here you are. That little bitch! Hatice! Her name's Pınar. Everyone's entitled to be called by the name they want. Look at me. Come on. Look. [phone clicking] [upbeat jazz playing] THE PACKAGE IS READY [rapid breathing, groaning] Move! [music fades] [sighs] Huh? So you got any last words? [grunting] Why are you doing this? It's bullshit! How many orphans have died 'cause of you? You think on that. [Sadık strains] [phone clicks] Once upon a time, I was an orphan too. [upbeat jazz resumes] [Sadık] He's in the safe house. - [Kamil] Vodka? - No, thanks. I'm driving. [music fades] Bravo, Sadık. You successfully lured the devil out of his den. [Kamil] You know you put yourself at great risk by coming here, don't you? Ah... Or do you also like to walk along the edge of a cliff? No way, no, no. Don't worry about me. I've taken some precautions. [chuckles] So what happens with Tevfik? We'll continue from where we were. He'll fall before us. And before fear and terror. So you'll keep on discovering the limits of this pure pleasure. - Yeah. - Hmm. And there's no way besides violence? Pure pleasure springs forth from evil. Just like the devil is born from the heart. After all, good and evil are siblings. Could be. Could be. [Sadık] I mean, even a good guy could turn into a bad one when he's out for justice. Good. Let's go. [light jazz playing] No, just you. Hand over the keys. Now. Come on. [car door opens] If you've got any kind of weapon, take it out and drop it. Kick it over. Throw me the bag. Do it. Okay, so this is it! You made it close. To the wooden bridge. [wailing in pain] Take out your phone! Now! Bastard! [groaning] [Nuri] Oh, my leg! Ah! My fuckin' leg! [groaning] [groaning, breathing rapidly] [groaning] Listen up! Tevfik's over there. Go get him before he's bear food. [groaning] Where the hell are you going?! - [groaning] - [silenced gunshot] [air hissing] [groaning] [thunderclap] [breathing rapidly] [sniffling] Grave. [inhales sharply] One... [Tevfik gasping] [Tevfik gasps] [eerie string music swelling on stereo] - [music halts] - Sixteen thousand eighty-one... [heavy breathing] - Sixteen thousand eighty-two... - [cell phone vibrating] Yeah? [bird squawking] [car horn honks] The money from the safe and the car invoices. And these are the keys to Hamza's car. Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. We mocked you, called you "detective man." But we were wrong. We're in your debt. So here's my offer to you, Mr. Sadık. You can keep Hamza's car. And I grant you one wish. Money, gold... You name it. Sir doesn't leave a debt unpaid. I don't want any money or any gold. - But I'll give you two addresses. - [Sir] Mm-hm. - 'Kay? - Text those to us. Let's not waste any time. Then make your way straight home, Sadık. Tevfik and us... You would be wise to forget it all. [automatic gunfire] [Sir] Don't show your face again. We've settled every debt we owe. Understand me? [jazz string suite playing] [gunfire continues] [Tevfik panting] [breathing rapidly] [car engine turns over] [music fades] [man] Look, Sadık. I'm here to remind you that you should listen to reason. You think the prosecutors will have a change of heart this time? The best and most beneficial thing for you... DAY 10 ...is to accept responsibility from the get-go. For one thing, you'll be sparing Rezzan all the suffering she would otherwise endure. We're prepared to pay handsomely for it. For all of it. Okay, Arif, look. I think... this is your chance to show your generosity. Here's what we'll do. So, that reimbursement? You're going increase that by double. Because you guys were together in this fraud, and seven years ago, instead of Rezzan Demir, I got locked up. Because... she had just had a miscarriage. I'm pregnant now. But I'm not your husband now. It's him. What are you waiting for, Arif? Have the man deliver the money. Yeah, Mister Bank. Call the man for that money. And while we wait for it to get here, you're gonna tell me the stunt you two pulled together, hear me? I should know what I'm gonna be charged with. You know? Um, okay. I'll give you the short version. [upbeat jazz playing] [Arif] All right. Here's your money. [inhales sharply] Andante. - One... - Is he insane? So what do you say? Oh, I'm just trying to decide. Should I take this and move to a tropical island, or buy a hotel in Eskişehir? Because I'm certain I won't be going to jail. Sadık, not fair. [Arif] Wait a minute. Why are you taking the money, then? What? Are you trying to con us? Who has just admitted that they were frauds? VOICE MEMO [gasps] [whistles] I don't know if you've ever read Dostoevsky, but he has great heroes in his novels. Rezzan is not a fan of heroes. But you should heed my advice here, okay? You should give up your freedom in exchange for Rezzan's in just the same way I did seven years ago. Be a hero for her. Your famous lawyers will get you out in a few years. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... [chuckles] [Sadık laughs] Your husband hasn't read Dostoevsky either. [chuckles] His loyalty to you lasted only eight seconds. Oh. And I know you're not pregnant. That loving, unselfish, caring guy... What happened to you? I changed. I'm not loyal now. I'm just. [upbeat jazz playing] [Cemile] Here, boy. There you go. See how they fall backwards while trying to see it! I'm just like them now! One... Damn it, Sadık! You interrupted me and I forgot my line. How will Romeo's words reach the ears of the beautiful young Juliet now? Pack up your things. Eskişehir it is! - Yes! - Sadık? [triumphant horn music playing] [Seval laughing] My name's Adil now. All right, Adil. I really love that.
