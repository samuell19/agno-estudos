Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. That was great. Go ahead, go ahead. Tear. At first glance, it's a tear. Do you want help? No, no, I'm fine, thanks. - Hi, Yann. - Hi. How are you? Shit, did they put a cast on you? Yes, I went to the emergency room, they put it on me right away. Okay, but you're going to have to take it off soon. Here, I'll take that. Okay. You'll have to go to Dr. Tran she'll tell you exactly what you have and insist we treat it correctly because of course a dancer in plaster... it's just not possible. Okay. So, I think I'll just observe you today, I'm not really going to manipulate, it's a little early. - Okay. - I'll let you get settled. I guess you already know everything? Yeah. I mean, you know, just a lot of chatter. But are they saying? About you and Julien? Well, yes. Yes. Well, no, that's not... Here, go ahead and lie down. Let me know if there's anything that hurts you. No, I'm fine. Are you okay? Hmm? Are you okay? I don't know, you look a little weird. No, I... Well, actually... I was with Blanche. - What? - Yeah. - For two years. - What? I had no idea. You didn't know, well... You know, she displayed herself in front of everyone with Julien, while with me, she wanted to be super discreet about it. She kept telling me the dance community is a den of blabbermouths. I can confirm that. - Yes. - Damn. We kept it a secret so people wouldn't talk about us. I am disgusted. Plus she was telling me that she always hated dancing guys, well... So, we are the two cuckolds of the house. Yes. Sorry. No, Yann. Excuse me. No, no, don't cry, because if you do, I'm going to. Oh my god! I think I really just need to start to work on myself, you know, because there are just a lot of bad vibes here. I don't know how you took it, but it made me... You see, for example, I don't know how I'm going to, to treat people while I'm... Wait. - I'm sorry. - Please sit down. Breathe. Lie down. Try to breathe. It's going to be okay. This is nonsense. No. They're jerks. We are stronger than they are. You're right. Yes, breathe. It feels good what you're doing there. I'm feeling much better. Elise, Margaret wants to talk to you. Now? Yes, she's down in the cafeteria with Hofesh Shechter. Hofesh Shechter? Is he here? Yes. I heard he's putting on a show in Paris in six months. See you later? No, I'm headed out after this. Okay. Oh! My poor Elise, you didn't miss a thing. Elise Gautier. How much longer do you have? Did they tell you? I don't know yet. Come on, don't freak out, you'll be fine. Miss Gautier? Have there been different traumatic recurrences on this ankle? Yes, this is clearly my weakness. In fact, this is the third time I've had a sprain on it, and last time, I admit, I didn't do all the rehab. That's not very smart. Well, now I'm less surprised by what I see. So what you have is what we call a fracture of the malleolus with bone stripping. That's what you see on the MRI. This is a form of severe sprain which can be quite nasty if not treated properly. What does that mean? Depending on the treatment you pursue and the effectiveness of your rehabilitation, the ankle may not recover its full flexibility and it will prohibit certain movements, like lifting on pointe, for example. - It can be complicated. - Complicated? It will take three to four months to be sure, but once we can make a confident diagnosis it may be necessary to look at surgical intervention and then... And then? That's hard to say for certain. If there is an operation, it will require a complete stop to intense physical activity for a year, well, more like two years. Two years? Sometimes more, but as a rule, two years are enough to be sure that the joint recovers completely. We will do things in order, and you come back to see me in three or four months. But that's not possible, two years! I'm 26 years old. I have to dance now. It's either this or never dance again. And that's good? Yes, it's cool. What's up? Did she... How are you? What did she tell you? - Do you want me to help you? - No, I don't. Thanks, Julien. I'll be honest. I've never really felt he was in love with you. Really? Yes, I don't know why, I didn't trust him at all. But you could have told me before. It was more of a hunch than anything else. Besides, it's hard to say something like that to a friend. No, not necessarily. Look, if I learned that Jean-Baptiste was dumping me for another girl, I think I would be destroyed. All the same, I think that if Jean-Baptiste dumped you, it would not necessarily be for another girl. What are you saying? Well, it could be for someone else altogether. What do you mean? I don't understand. No, but it's just that... If someone told me that Jean-Baptiste was gay, I wouldn't be completely surprised. Jean-Bapt? Yes. But Elise, we've been together for three years. How are you? If you fall, it doesn't matter. You try again later. Wasn't that great? Yes. Yeah, it was pretty good, but I don't know, hip-hop is really not my thing. Stop, it was great dancing! I don't care if it's hip-hop or... Clearly. - Way to go, man! - Were you there? - Yes, it was great. - Thank you. Yes, well, I really liked it. That's cool, thanks. See you soon? Let's have a drink. With pleasure. He's good. Yes, he's very good. How do you know him? It's been a long time. But can you imagine if I could never dance again? But, you're going to dance again, Elise. I believe it. Are you turning around? That's what bothers me about traditional medicine, is that they tell you their "truth," before which they ask you to prostrate yourself, when in fact there is so much they still don't understand. Wait, that hurts. Does it hurt now? Let me compare with the other one. Mind you, I believe in science, I believe in the progress of medicine, but I think that there is, how can I put it... A mystery of the body. That's it. But if she tells me I can't dance for a year or two. Tran told me definitely: "If there is an operation, it will require a complete stop." And? She didn't say, "If there's an operation, there should be a complete stop." It shows. She has made up her mind. No offense, but, who is she to be so sure of that? Elise, you have just been through a trauma, and in fact both of us have also suffered a trauma. We need to rebuild. Here, your injury is directly linked to your emotions. Your body has spoken to you and your body has said, "My little one, the pain of your separation, you will feel it in your flesh." You've clearly lost support here. And my own work, with you, of course, is to find your symmetry. We'll find your center. Does it hurt? Yes, a little more. You see, that's exactly why I wanted you to go to law school. If you had gone to law school, you would never have had this kind of problem. That's the whole problem with the body, you see. You, you had the chance to be beautiful. You're still beautiful, but it won't last. When you're 40 or 50, you'll see. A body ages and then you can't capitalize on it. Look at Caro, she was a flight attendant, now... Dad, that's really rotten to say about Auntie Caro. Besides, she's your little sister. You're older than her, Dad. What I'm saying is that if you build your life on your body, it's like soccer players, at 35, you're retired. You are finished. So no matter what, with this kind of career, you have to change your life. That's the way it is. So if you base your job on your body, you have to have at least two lives. I'm willing to have two lives. Why can't I have two lives? Well, you see, as you get older, while you can get Alzheimer's or you can have a stroke, otherwise, except for serious accidents, the work of the mind, the mind stays awake until the end, you know? Look at Jean d'Ormesson. That's one example, but you can find many like it. What you don't understand, Dad, is that if you have two lives, the problem is that I didn't finish my first one. I like to dance, I always want to dance. - Yes, but... - But what? Earlier, all you could think to say to me was "You should have gone to law school." Oh dear, what is wrong with you? I don't know. You were there, though, at the premiere. You saw me get hurt on stage and you don't even call me back there. Of course I tried to call you! Your phone was off. I even tried to go backstage and someone told me it was okay, you just twisted your ankle. Dad, I didn't just twist my ankle. Actually, I've got something serious. I may never dance again. - Really? - Yes. It's not my fault. In addition, it was that same evening your sisters both had problems. Melody and her water damage, Aria and her Wi-Fi problems. - You're here already? - Yes, I am. I just talked to Melody. She is on her way. That's good. Next time, try not to have all of your problems at the same time! What are you talking about, Dad? What's wrong with him? I should have gone to law school. Don't think you can change him. He's impossible. Well, maybe I'm stupid, but I still hope he will open up and understand No, no, he's not like that. That's all. Doesn't that bother you? Yes, but let's just say I've gotten used to it. It's true that it's embarrassing, you know, but you get used to it. I'm still struggling. Yes, but it's up to you to change. Don't worry, with all that's happening to me, I'll have to change. Why? What does it mean? I'm not with Julien anymore. What? And, I am officially no longer with the company. I'll give myself a month to think about it, but I have to find something to do other than dancing. No! No, no, Elise, you can't stop dancing. What? Why can't I stop dancing? - No, you can't. - Can't what? What's going on with you, Aria? Every time I say a word, you attack! You can't do that to Mom. To Mom? What is this? You think I'm happy to make a decision like this? Do you think you're the only one who thinks about Mom? Don't tell me stuff like that. Besides, you don't have a monopoly on not having a mom. Do you put balsamic vinegar in the boeuf bourguignon? It works so well with wine. It adds a little bit of caramel. It's so good. Put it back on the fire... Bam! Then we add the mushrooms. So, Dad, do you think it's good? I didn't say it was bad. But do you find it good or not? Yes, it's not bad at all. It's true. So, do you like it? Yes, since I'm telling you it's not bad. And how are things at your restaurant? Oh, it's going great. People love it. They think it's very good. Great. The only problem I have, is that I can't find the right staff, but otherwise Did you read the book I gave you? No, I haven't read it. It's the best description of life in the countryside in the classical age. What does that have to do with Melody's restaurant? What? Nothing. Did I miss something here? I have a little trouble with you and culture, I find. No ? Dad, I work in culture, after all, I remind you. Finally... No? Okay. No, but yes, of course it's culture, but... It is not the... No, I mean, there is an intellectual life. There is a life that only literature can give you. Mom. Since you died, Dad has always tried to make up for your absence. But, like most fathers, Dad was never very good at being a mother. Next time, we need to leave early. I remember the first time you took me to dance class. You told me I was going to do what you did and what Grandma did before you. It was in Blois, I was six years old. Six. The hand of the bar, and we open the arm on the side. Half-bent, stretched, arm carriage... and four. When I think back to all the hours of classes I did with Mrs. Levan, you always came with me. You would wait for me at the end of school and we would go straight to dance class. Very quickly, it filled my days. I barely had time to see my girlfriends. I had rehearsals or shows all the time. At first, it wasn't too far, it was fine. Will we stay for a long time? But from 9 to 12 years old, we had to go to Tours and then, it was much further. But it was a great class with Miss Pinson, a former dancer at the Paris Opera. And that's when you left, Mom. But despite everything, I continued. It reminded me of you. Two and three. And one, three, four, a beautiful weather bound. The arm is extended well above the wrist. A good plié, we twist the upper body, that's it. One, two, three, four. One, two, three and four, clear, we turn our shoulders. That's it. That was better, Elise. When you fold well like that, you can see it in the look on your face. It's much clearer. It's getting much better. It is imperative that she continue next year. No, no, I understand very well, and simply, we'll see. But really, especially with what she's been through. Yes, yes, but this, it's tricky for me, it's far, it's still very far. Elise, are you coming back next year? - Yes. - Will you promise me? Yes, I promise. Yes. Mademoiselle Pinson had done everything so I could enter the dance school of the Paris Opera. The first day at the boarding school, there were many girls crying, but I was so happy to spend all my days doing nothing but dancing. Lorraine, are you crying? I think that's the hardest part today. Don't worry. To look back on all that time and think that it was all for nothing. Do you know about this? About what? Adele was cast in Hofesh's show. Yes ? That's great. So now she's going to join his company. She is lucky. Do you know Sabrina? Sabrina? Yes, we went to dance school together, but I haven't seen her since her accident. Sabrina doesn't dance anymore, but she gets by. I wanted to dance Le Lac, Giselle, become a prima ballerina, and at 18, everything fell apart. I had to forget my dreams and decide to change my route. It was like starting a second life. But how do you live with it now? Let's just say when you change your route, you change your dreams. Yes. Now I tell myself that I have the right to have other dreams. And what do you dream about now? I would like to be an actress. - Yes? - Yes. That's what inspires me now. I mean, I already am, but it's just not easy, it's... I mean, I still feel like a beginner. A bit like when we were in dance school at the beginning. That's cool. But can you make a living from it? That's another story. What does that mean? Let's just say that I do a lot of stuff on the side, so yes, I manage to get by. Yes, well, if you ever want to do something together, I'm interested. Great. That's great, Elise, I have everything I need. Here, you change the card. Sabrina, you get ready, you'll be up next. And Heidi, are you good? We are well, it is beautiful, it is good. Great! Come on! So, come on in. Get closer to your husband. Don't look at her, Dan. Look tor the horizon, over there. There, further. You stare at the horizon and Heidi, on the other hand, you are looking at him with love. Go ahead, go. There you go, that's good, that's not bad. You know what? Take a knee. - On the floor? - Yes, yes, on the floor. Come on, there you go, that's good, look at it. It's beautiful. The horizon, Dan. Yes, that's right. Yeah, yeah, that's good. There, we like it. Here, we like that, it's nice. It's much nicer when you're way down. But what is this story? What? No, but... What is the principle of being far below? What is the problem? The problem is it's embarrassing what you're asking. - What, me? - Yes. How old are you, Heidi? - Sixteen. - She is sixteen. I don't see the problem. I've been making catalogs for years. It's okay. It's a super classic pose. Just because it's classic doesn't mean you have to do it. We can't do that anymore. It's not possible. What does it mean to keep broadcasting this kind of image? This kind of image? You ask a young girl to kneel before a man twice her age to make it look pretty? Unbelievable! You don't even realize how creepy it is. Creepy? What's wrong with you? Sabrina, don't worry, it's not serious. But yes, it is serious. Heidi, I'm not letting you do this, it's not possible. Where did this crazy lady come from? This what? I'm sorry, you said what? I didn't hear you. - Did you say I was crazy? - Wait, Sabrina. - Did you say I was crazy? - Calm down. Say it again, asshole, and I'll knock your teeth out. The photographer, he just ignited Sabrina's fury. I thought she was going to slap him and we ran away. Sabrina! What an asshole! I should have kicked him. You are completely crazy. Come on! Do you want him to break your other leg? Move, move! Ouch! Okay, you can turn around. I like her, Sabrina. We get along well, and I find she makes me feel good. She even offered me a job with her boyfriend. It's kitchen work, and I like the chance to do something around food because I've always loved cooking. - Yeah? - Yeah. And Loïc, her boyfriend, I hear he's a great cook, so... So you're going to give up dancing altogether? I have to. But yeah, it sure feels weird. Yeah, it's normal for it to feel weird. You've come a long way to do what you do. I mean, what you were doing. I tell myself that all the time right now: all that for this. You say that like it's over, but it's not. You have to believe. You have to hang on. Can you straighten up? Also, what pisses me off, is that almost all classical ballets tell the stories of women whose lives go wrong. It is always tragic destinies for women. Look at Giselle, Swan Lake, La Bayadère. It's like dancing, was made to tell people that when you are a woman, you are always bound to have a nasty, tragic fate. And you realize then, that all the heroines in their white tutus, are dead women, ghosts of scorned women, betrayed, destroyed. That's me. - No. - But yes, it's true! I have become a classical ballet heroine. No, you're exaggerating, but not that much. Can you lie down? - Yes, I swear. - Do you mind? There's not a single classical ballet that tells a positive story for a woman. Unless it's about a girl who, like, disobeys. And then in contemporary dance, you have no choice. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Well, anyway, I'm off to something else. Maybe you're right. You have to go where life takes you. Come on. Frankly, I feel that you are on the right track, you are on the right path, the path that will refocus you, the path that will lead you to yourself. You think so? Shall we stand up? Is it over? Yes, that's it. Come on, I'll walk you home. Do you have everything? Yeah. Anyway, it's crazy how far you've come. You really think so? Yeah. But then I find, I don't know, we're both super in tune. Yeah, I feel it too. Thank you. No, thanks to you. You know, to rebuild, it takes two. You also help me a lot. You know, I told you, I am going to Goa to an ashram, and that means we won't see each other for a long time. It's so great that you're doing this. Yeah, no, it's great. It's an internship I've been waiting for, so I'm very excited... ah, it's so stupid anyway. I mean, I'm not going to be there with you. No, but don't worry, it doesn't matter, I will wait for you. I'm not going to leave you for another physio. Have a good trip. You too, no, see you soon. Thank you very much. Thanks to you. I don't understand why so many girls are going vegan right now. It's not just the girls. Yeah. Not only girls, but it is mostly girls who do it. Maybe women just pay more attention to their bodies, that's all. Nonsense. Plus, excuse me, it is known that fruits and vegetables are better assimilated. They're full of fiber, more suitable for... What are you doing to me? What do I do to you? No. No, Loïc, not you, you are not going to go vegan on me too. No. I am considering it. I am just considering it. Damn it, Loïc! - Ribs? - Yeah. - You love them, ribs? - Yeah. Beef bourguignon? Lamb chops? - Sausage? - Sausage is not the same. Yes, and sea bass en papillote, and grilled sea bream, and shrimp! Ceviche, you love ceviche! Can you imagine a life without ceviche? I'm just saying that vegans tell you you can get by just fine without them. Yes, you can also live by reading only two books. What's that have to do with anything? What do books have to do with ceviche? Yes, there is a connection, they piss me off, the vegans. You have to accept people as they are. You need to be a little more inclusive. - Sorry, inclusive? - Yeah, inclusive. You sound like a little bitch TV reporter. A bitch? I'm a bitch? - I'm a bitch? - Yeah. - I'm a bitch? - Yeah, you're just a bitch. - A bitch. - Yeah. Hold on. You're my little bitch. Little bitch? Come here, I'll eat you. Please stop. Loïc, please. Please stop. Stop, it's okay, Elise, it's okay! Elise, relax, there's no one there. - I'm sorry. - It's under control. It's okay, it's not a big deal, everything is fine. Hi Josiane. My Loïc! Welcome to the club of the crippled. I see I have a girlfriend there. We picked the worst waitress we could find, we thought you'd like it. Were you born that way or did you just get back from skiing? No, it's an injury, but not skiing. It's been three months. That's good, I've been doing it 30 years. So, which one is the lucky one? This is it. So, you're going to sleep here and you two, you want to sleep in the truck? - Yeah. - No. I see this is new to you. Well, when you come to an agreement, let me know if I should give you a room. I saw him with other girls, but with you, it's obvious something's different. In fact, I've never seen him in love. Perhaps you'll keep quiet, Josiane. They are leaving tonight. Can you make them something good? Yeah, sure. I immediately feel at home here. For me, that's what this place is all about. I like talented people and I like to make them feel comfortable. I believe that for artists to express themselves, you have to leave them alone. I can't do anything myself. I don't paint, I don't play music, I can't dance, but I deeply love people who do things. And here, for example, I would love it if you would make us some food. Right now? Right now, right now, right now. Sabrina, please? Yes, here we go. Shit, it's shit. Shit! Stop bitching, it's super good. I'm not bitching! I said a Nagoya chicken, excuse me, Sabrina. Nagoya chicken needs ginger yuzu, I didn't find any yuzu. I don't want to serve it. What's going on? Taste it. Taste this stuff. Oops! Did you miss something? You must be unwell, because that's great. See, you're pissing everybody off. Let's send it! Okay, make it go away then. Go, go, go! Was the soup good? Yes, delicious. That's also what food is, good food, it's calming. It's a hit! They love it, my love, see? That's it! Stop panicking! We know each other, right? Yeah. I met you with Jean-Baptiste after your battle at 104. Yes, that was it. But what are you doing here? I'm working, well, I'm helping out a friend. And you... And you, you all do hip hop? No, we are a contemporary dance company. No way! Adèle? It's so great to see you here! It's amazing! You're here with the company? Yes, that's right, with everyone. Do you work here? Yeah, I have to go. Is your leg okay? Yeah, well... See you later. Okay. So they left you alone to peel? Yeah, they cook the rest in the food truck. What are you making tonight? From this? I don't know. Loïc just asked me to prepare them. Aren't you exaggerating a little? I spoke with Sabrina. She told me about your injury. You don't know if you'll be able to dance again or not, right? Yeah, but... I don't know. When I see them, I think to myself... You feel like shit? Yeah. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but maybe it's good to feel a little shitty. It shows you how lucky you've always been. You were always talented, your beauty came naturally. Not many people get that, you know. Me, I didn't get any of this. Up until now, being well has been normal for you. But that isn't actually normal. To be well is an opportunity. In fact, being well is a privilege. So spending some time like those who are not so lucky, it can only do you good. Look at him, for example. He's the typical kind of guy who had a bad start in life. I know his parents. Poor guy, he was in a bad place, with a violent and alcoholic father and submissive mother. He got the classic package to make for a shitty adolescence. The kitchen, it saved him. Do you know what the first woman who climbed the Himalayas said? No. "It's because I had fallen very low that I was able to climb so high." Well, will you set this table or not? What are you doing all alone with my chair? You want to break it? I'm sorry, everybody's gone. Yes, well, don't. Get help from Elise instead. Elise, go help him, before he breaks my chair. Go ahead. In any case, even injured, you can't dance worse than the chair. Go on! You have to move a little, it will do you good. Come on. Would you mind giving me a hand? I need to rehearse. No, don't worry. She's right, I can't be worse than the chair. It's super simple. The idea is that you are a dead woman. It's cool if you can find a blank stare. Okay. You know, really dead. You relax, you loosen up. I make you dance and you try to keep up. Does it work? I've seen you rehearse a bit. Okay, that's going to be easier then. We start sitting down. - Okay. - You can sit between my legs. Yeah, get close. - Like this? - That's it, that's enough. And so really, direct, you can look down diagonally with your eyes. We're just getting started. I straighten you up slightly, relax your wrists, your elbows, let them fall. That's right. Close the leg, bring it back. - Like this? - That's it, perfect. Open wide, throw it out. You've done some dancing, it shows. If it hurts you, we'll stop. No, I swear, it's okay. In fact, it feels good, it doesn't hurt me. - What's your first name? - Élise. Élise Gautier. It was Adele who told me about you, you were in the same company, right? - Yeah. - Okay. Shall we do it again? Sometimes I feel too masculine. Stop, there is no one more womanly than you. I agree. No, I swear, I don't feel feminine, I don't feel... Darling, stop. Trust me, I know better than you what is feminine. How do you know what is feminine? Because guys are more sensitive to detecting what is feminine in a woman. What you're talking about is bullshit. - How are you? - I'm fine, and you? I want to thank you for this afternoon. Thanks to you too. Did it help you? Yes, I think you're pretty. Excuse me? I didn't get that. I think you are pretty. - Am I pretty? - Yeah. "Pretty?" I'm "pretty?" Oh, great. Does it piss you off that I say you're pretty? No, it's nice to tell someone they're pretty. I love being told I'm pretty. See you later. - Me, you say I'm pretty! - But you are really pretty! But this is an insult! Stop talking like that! - I'm not insulting you. - But yes, it is an insult! - We don't agree. - We will never agree! If I tell you you're pretty, it's not an insult! Pretty is very demeaning, you know? You can't tell someone like that that they're pretty! Asshole! Take this to the vegan, tell him it's tofu. - Go for it! - Okay. This is tofu. - How's the show going? - Shut up. And what do your parents do? My father is a lawyer. And your mother? She is dead. No, but that was a long time ago. And how often do you see your father? Well, I mean... It is important to force yourself to talk to your parents. What does that mean? I didn't do that, and I regret not having spoken face to face with my father. To tell him what? Just to talk to him. Like an adult, not like a child. I believe that if he had told me, "I love you," it could have done me a lot of good. You see, sometimes you don't need anything big. But my father wasn't the type. My father's the same. He hardly ever says "I love you." Yes, dads are often like that. They hide their feelings. I don't know why. They don't know how to show their children what is important. Do you think it would have made a difference to you? A lot. Yes, very much so. We're going for a walk. We want to see the sea. Are you interested? Do you think I look like I want to go for a walk? Happy to have left the kitchen? Yeah. I'm so happy to see the sea. Besides, we're right next door. Elise, have a drink. I have a bottle of red. Would you like a drink? It's cool, I'm happy. You are able to rebuild. Yeah, yeah. It's not like before, but it's coming back a little bit. This afternoon, it was incredible. After I did that, I hardly even limped anymore. That's crazy. Yeah, it's a classic. When you limp for a long time, it becomes almost automatic. Eventually, you're not limping because you're hurt, but because you're afraid of being hurt. But how do you know that? I had a small accident two years ago. I couldn't dance for six months. So the whole natural apprehension thing, I get it. But there's no need to be afraid anymore. But I think I'd rather be afraid just a little bit more. No, you mustn't. I can help you with that, if you want. You know, I'm kind of like a superhero. I have superpowers. I can turn ice into fire, pain into pleasure. - I can handle your limp. - Hold on. Vincent, I'm sorry. I don't want that at all, in fact. I'm sorry, it's not you. Can we still have a drink together? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck. Hello, Yann? Hi, how are you? I'm fine and you? I'm doing all right. I'm in Goa now. No, I'm just kidding. I just got back here. I mean, I've been home for like two hours. But you, how are you? I'm fine. I'm in Brittany. I've started dancing again. It's going much better. Hold on. Hello? Hold on. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Hello? Yes, I hear you now. But you still have a little pain? Yes, yes. It still hurts a little bit. But I don't really know. Right now, it seems okay. Okay. If you're in pain, we should meet. Because you have to be careful, we need to do the exercises at the same time. We'll get back on track. Where are you? In Brittany, between Ploërmel and Quiberon. I love it. So cool. Can I come? I can come! Honestly, I think I'm fine, don't worry. I'm telling you, it's my pleasure. And seriously, if you're in pain, we shouldn't leave it like that. It would be bad. Okay, if you want. Well, cool. Great. Namaste then. See you then. Kisses. See you soon. Hello? Yeah. Kisses, yeah. Ouch! Yann, how are you? - You're good? - Yeah, and you? I'm glad to see you. - Same. - You look good! Yes, getting better. This fucking weather. - I can imagine. - Brittany is not Goa. Come in. - Can I? - Yeah, sure. I'm not interrupting? No, not at all. On the contrary. Let me introduce you to Yann. This is my physio. Yeah. - Don't just stand there! - Nice to meet you. - May I? - Of course. Go ahead. - Do you want something to drink? - No, I'm fine, thanks. I find it's a technique that can give a lot of freedom, since it's about how you line up and how everything works. When you understand that, it can be extraordinarily free. But to get there takes a long time. I still love ballet because of my training. For now, I still approach it that way, like Elise. And I find it really beautiful. But I must admit it's getting harder and harder for me to wear a tutu. Because the tutu, it is corny, no? What do you know about it? There's nothing corny about tutus. It's my personal opinion. When you put a tutu, it's corny. What are you talking about? You don't know anything about ballet, Loïc. You can't say it's corny. I'm talking about the tutu. That's all. I agree with her. There's nothing ridiculous about it. If I may interject, I know what you mean. Because I used to think like you, but the moment you see someone dance like Elise or Adele, I think it will totally change your vision. Suddenly, it's not cheesy at all, it becomes super beautiful. It's just that you know nothing about it. There are scenes from the repertoire that are so sublime that at once, it's not cheesy. I know. I didn't say cheesy. That's not what I said. ...repertoires that are incredible. It's time. - No. - Yes. We'll show them. - Watch and learn. - I'm watching. Watch, watch, watch. So... was I corny? Flex. And point. Frankly, it's not bad. It's good. Hang in there. You lost a little. - Smoothness? - Yeah. Yes, perhaps. It's okay. Can you stand up and walk around a bit? Yeah. How do you feel? It hurts a little bit still. Maybe it hurts, but frankly, you're not limping at all. When I was watching you dance, it's crazy, you're not tentative at all. Yeah. That was really the first time I try to push that hard on it. - Really? - Yeah. Honestly, compared to last month, it's pretty spectacular. Yeah. Even if I'm in a little pain, it hurts less than not dancing. That's for sure. You know, Elise, the only thing that really matters -- it may sound obvious -- is "the now," so I think, you know, that to live, is to really accept the present time, without being turned towards the past, towards the traumas. So, maybe you should allow yourself to meet someone new. I think I met someone. - Yes? - Yes. Who is this lucky guy? It's Medhi. No, what? Medhi. - It's Medhi? - Yeah. Who is Medhi? You met him earlier. Yes. Great. Great. Wow! We will stop here for today. Yes? It's great, though! Very good. - Can you give me a minute? - Okay. - You don't mind? - No, go ahead. - Are you okay? - Yeah. What about you? Yes. Great. My ankle, then, is -- No, no, fine. The ankle is fine. Elise! I have to go. I'm coming, I'm coming! It's too good. Yann, it's too good, isn't it? Yes. It's truly too good, what you did there. I could pick that up -- Here, try it with a small pear, this is from Burgundy. That's good, top me off there. Go ahead, go ahead. The magic of the flame. I'll tell you what, it goes very well with the music, the taste of this. That's why I put the Madagascar vanilla in it, because it made me think of music. Can you hear it? Yes, vanilla. It's a complex illusion, look: pear, chocolate, vanilla, pear. Pear, twice, pear. Pear, yeah. Pear-pear. It's pear-pear, since there are... I think a lot about juxtapositions, associations, oppositions... What the hell is this crap? When you see what you see here, and we hear what we hear. Do we agree? And when we eat what we eat. We are free to think what we think. No, but for me, it's at times like this that I could almost come because... - No. - What? Yes, it is. He doesn't get it. You know what I mean, it's all that, all that. This is all dance. It doesn't matter where they're from, my favorite residents are always the dancers because they... I just love it. I don't know. When they move, you mean? With the... The hands, the body? When they move with their arms? With their bodies? The movement? Yes. When they dance? Dance? That's it! That's it! I want that... I want that... on my plate. Look at this. - What is it? - I don't know what it is. Come on, Yann, wrists, wrists. No, I'm fine. Leave me alone. That was cool, thank you. - Ciao and thank you! - Goodbye Sabrina! - Do you know him? - Yes, I know him. Who is this guy? - When will you be back? - Two weeks. And? And what? I don't know. Medhi. Medhi, let's go. Go ahead. It's so beautiful. What a jerk. Fuck. He's exhausting. Thank you, Josiane. Don't kid yourself, you're back at it. You need to dance. Keep it up. Work hard, help us all to have our little access to beauty. Will you promise me? Yeah, I promise. Honestly, it's quite impressive. Your malleolus no longer shows any trace of the fracture and the bone tear is hardly noticeable. Take a look. It's good. You still have to let the joint rest, but the operation can already be ruled out. Really? I felt it was getting better, but -- Yes, but you need to be patient and not over-exert. Yes, but still, I feel better. Yes, but you know, the body is like a car. If you try to drive with an already damaged axle, there is a greater chance of accident than if you leave it in the garage. I'm so glad you're back, but frankly, the contemporary, I really can't do it. It's true, you always anchored to the ground, there's no lightness, while in classical, you are turned towards the sky! That airy lightness suits me better. It's true that you're more in contact with the ground in contemporary, or in hip-hop. I don't know, it's as if there's a relationship to the earth, to reality. It's true that the floor is scary in classical, but now it's like my feet are looking for the ground instead of running away from it, and I like that a lot. Plus, it makes me see ballet differently now. It's true that classical music is more of a dream, but that's what I like, frankly. Yeah, but real is good sometimes. That said, with Hofesh, there is a real form of spirituality, there is a kind of quest for the beyond, for the light, something bigger than human, but in a more tribal, more animal way. I love it. What's up? - Where should we meet? - Where should we meet? Where are you? I'm at Botzaris now. Okay, one second. Okay, you can get to my house in 19 minutes. Yeah, okay. Wait though, because if you start moving too, we can meet in less than 10 minutes. Are you running now? - I'll be right there. - Okay. It's my dad. I'm not answering. No, go ahead. I'm not disturbing you? No. Elise, I'm coming to Paris tomorrow, and it would be nice to eat together, right? Okay. Just us two? Yes. Meet me at Amaury's office, will you? Yes, I know where it is. Okay. - 12:30? - Okay, 12:30 is fine. It's okay? Okay. - Tomorrow then? - All right, fine. Did you get the book I sent you? Yeah, but I haven't read it. I haven't had time. I have a lot of work to do right now. Read it. You know, you read a page a day, 120 pages, 120 days. That's nothing, 120 days. See you tomorrow? See you tomorrow. Kisses. Okay, yes, me too. Hello, my daughter. Oh my! Elise. Do you recognize Amaury? - Uh, yes, of course. - Not sure? I'm look like an old codger now, but I remember you, you were only this tall, with your two sisters. Yes, it's been a long time. On the other hand, you do not know Alban de Vouvray. And that's a mistake because I deserve to be known. This is a de Vouvray from Vouvray. I'm from Vouvray and it makes them laugh. You may not know it, but your father, in this business, he is a star. They call him "the plea-boy", because his arguments... He is also called Henri the talkative, Henri the bib, Henri the submachine gun, and Henri the Punchline. So this is my party. We were going to have lunch, are you coming with us? - Uh... - Yes? No no no, we have lunch plans. - The family. - We'll leave you, then. See you soon. Did you want to have lunch with them instead? No, no, no. How are you, Henri the talkative? That's what those two call me. Hey, you don't have a limp at all. Yes, it is definitely better. I'm starting to dance again. Yes, I'm planning to do a show, but I hope I can keep it up for the duration. Okay, but isn't that a bit dangerous? No. Great, then. Now, to eat. - Are you hungry? - Yes, I am. Me too. I'm glad you came to Paris. I had a complicated case to deal with, we were close to dismissing. Why didn't you want to come and eat at my place? It's good here. Yeah, but, I don't know... We always went here with your mother when we came to Paris. Dad, I miss you not really caring about me. - About my life. - What? You don't realize it, but you've always been cold to me. Cold, me? For example, you never said, "I love you." And plenty of parents say "I love you" without any trouble. Me, I never told you I love you? No. What is this crap? Then go ahead. What? Then say it. I'm telling you. There is no doubt about it. No, no, no, but really say it. Say, "I love you, Elise." This is not something you say under threat. But honestly, do you feel like I've always been cold to you? Yeah. It wasn't always easy for me after Mom died. It wasn't easy for me either. Do you want to come and see what I'm doing now? I don't know. What are you doing? I told you, I work with a contemporary dance company. Contemporary dance? - Yeah. - Great. - But now? - Yes, now. - Now? - Yes! So yes, let's go... what a pleasure. Go ahead. Let me introduce you to Mehdi. Good morning, sir. Nice to meet you. Henri. And, well, Mehdi is... Mehdi. Okay. Great. I have to go change, but get settled. You can relax. Then I'll introduce you to the others. Yes. I'll be right there. Great. It's very impressive. But can you tell me where the bathroom is? Hofesh? I'm late. Could you come to the premiere of my show? Uh, I don't know. I'm going to have a lot of work to do in the coming weeks. Dad, please try. This is important to me. I will try, but... Yes, I will try. - Goodbye Adele. - Goodbye Henry. The moment we jumped like that my mind went into this... That was a weird way to start. No, but we were super close, right? I don't know. I feel like... I thought I felt you a moment. That's what I thought. In the dark, I had just felt in the dark... And then, when the lights came back on, I thought to myself, "How are we going to do the rest?" Hi. - How are you? - I'm fine! Wow, I just want to say congratulations. It was amazing. Thank you. Yes, sorry. Elise, Elise. - That's a great name. - Thank you. What are you doing now? We're going to have a drink, I think. Cool. Well, we'll follow them. Yes. I loved it. It gave me chills. - Did you really like it? - It was great. Frankly, it was too good. You've convinced me. What if I told you, this is the best part? Dear Mom, a few days before you left us, you said to me: "Enjoy all the lives that life can give." Mom, today, I am starting a new life.
