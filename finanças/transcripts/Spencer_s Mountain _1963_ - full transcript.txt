LIVVY'S FIXED A SATURDAY NIGHT SUPPER TOO GOOD FOR POOR FOLKS. ARE WE POOR, GRANDMA? I'D SAY WE WERE RICH, BECKY. WELL, THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE WERE SO POOR WE DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO EAT ALL WINTER EXCEPT THIS ONE SLICE OF BACON. HOW MANY OF YOU WAS THERE? NINE BROTHERS AND GRANDMA AND GRANDPA. YOU ALL LIVE OFF ONE SLICE? EWW, HOW COULD YOU? GRANDMA JUST TIED A PIECE OF STRING ON A LITTLE OLD PIECE OF BACON AND LET EACH ONE OF US CHEW IT A WHILE. WHY'D SHE TIE THE PIECE OF STRING ON THE BACON FOR? SO'S IF ANYBODY DARED SWALLOW IT, SHE COULD PULL IT OUT AND FEED IT TO THE NEXT ONE. AW, DADDY. Shirley: GOOD NIGHT, BECKY. Becky: NIGHT, SHIRLEY.

HE'S TIRED OF FOOLING AROUND. THERE THEY GO, RIGHT INTO THE BRIDAL CHAMBER. [LAUGHING] WHAT DID I SAY? OLD RELIABLE, THAT'S METHUSELAH. WE'LL PICK THE COW UP ON OUR WAY BACK DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. THANKS FOR THE FAVOR, MR. JOHN. THE PLEASURE'S ALL METHUSELAH'S. [LAUGHS] I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE CLARISSE COLEMAN'S FELLA. HER FATHER MANAGES THE QUARRY. YOU KNOW WHAT? NO, WHAT? YOU AND ME COULD HAVE SOME FUN. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THAT BOY OF YOURS WILL BE NEEDING A WOMAN, CLAY. I GOT A HEALTHY YOUNG HEIFER THERE IN MINNIE CORA. STRONG, WILLING. JUST POPPED OUT OVERNIGHT, PERCY. Clay: COMING, CLAYBOY? LISTEN, WHENEVER YOU GET THE URGE TO, YOU JUST TOSS SOME PEBBLES ON MY WINDOW UP THERE. AND I'LL COME RUNNING. Clayboy: IT'S NOT WHAT COWS DO THAT SEEMS WRONG. I GUESS IT'S JUST HAVING NO CHOICE. Clay: DON'T GO GETTING ANY IDEAS THERE'S ANYTHING LOW-DOWN ABOUT IT, 'CAUSE THE LORD HIMSELF THOUGHT IT UP AND MADE US THE WAY HE DID. UNDERSTAND THAT, SON? YES, DAD, I THINK I DO. NO, YOU DON'T. NOBODY UNDERSTANDS IT. YOU BE PROUD YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING AND HAVE A CHOICE. NOT ALL HUMANS ARE THAT CHOOSY, EITHER. BUT HOW CAN HUMANS BE SURE THE RIGHT COUPLE GETS TOGETHER? WERE YOU SURE, DAD? YEP, I WAS. I WAS A REAL HELLER AFORE I MET YOUR PRETTY MA, BUT THE MINUTE I MET HER, I KNEW. DON'T ASK ME HOW, BUT I KNEW, JUST LIKE YOU WILL SOMEDAY, BOY. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, JUST REMEMBER YOU AIN'T ANY BULL, THAT LITTLE GIRL AIN'T ANY COW. BE KIND AND GENTLE. AND IF SHE LOVES YOU A LITTLE BIT BEFORE YOU MARRY HER, SHE'LL LOVE YOU A LOT MORE AFTER. PACK IT UP, SON. TIME TO QUIT. THOUGHT I'D FRAME THE WINDOW RIGHT HERE SO'S YOUR MA WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK OUT AT WHILE SHE'S WASHING DISHES. YOU'LL SIT ON THE PORCH HERE WITH YOUR BABIES ON YOUR LAP. YOU CAN TELL THEM YOU HELPED YOUR PAPA BUILD IT SO GOOD AND SOUND IT WON'T FALL DOWN IN A MILLION YEARS. SURE, DAD, I'LL TELL THEM. I'M GETTING HUNGRY. Clay: COLONEL. I'D RATHER NOT HAVE THIS WEEK'S OVERTIME SHOW IN THE BOOKS. HERE'S YOUR $18. AND THANKS FOR FEEDING THE DOG AND HORSES WHILE I WAS IN WASHINGTON. HOW'D YOU FIND YOUR DAUGHTER? SHE CAN'T WAIT FOR GRADUATION SO SHE CAN GET BACK HERE FOR SUMMER. CLARISSE RATHER ADOPTED THAT FAMILY OF YOURS LAST SUMMER, DIDN'T SHE? OR WAS IT YOUR OLDEST SON? SHE AND CLAYBOY MADE UP SOME KIND OF A SECRET CLUB WITH PASSWORDS AND ALL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM, COLONEL. GIRLS STILL SCARE HIM TO DEATH. HE DOESN'T WORRY ME. CLARISSE SEEMS A LITTLE MORE SOPHISTICATED. SHE'S GETTING TOO SMART FOR HER BRITCHES. I KNOW YOU WON'T TAKE ANY PAY FOR FEEDING MY ANIMALS, BUT SINCE THE TROUT SEASON OPENS FRIDAY, I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE A DAY OFF AT THE RIVER... WITH PAY. OLLIE OLLIE OXEN FREE. I SEE HIM! LET'S GO GET HIM! [CHILDREN SQUEALING] STOP MAKING SO MUCH NOISE! CLAYBOY'S UP THERE TRYING TO STUDY FOR HIS FINAL EXAMINATIONS! RIGHT HERE. STOP RIGHT HERE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SPEND YOUR DAY OFF UP AT THE DREAM HOUSE. FIRST TIME I EVER SAW A MAN BUILD A HOUSE WITH A FISHING POLE. AH, DON'T YOU WORRY. I'M BUILDING YOU A CASTLE UP THERE FIT FOR A ROYAL-BUTTED KING. YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE. I'VE GOT INNOCENT CHILDREN AROUND HERE THAT I'M TRYING TO RAISE TO BE GOOD CHURCHGOERS. NOBODY TURNED ME INTO A CHURCHGOER, AND LOOK WHAT A TALL DOG I TURNED OUT TO BE. [LAUGHS] 1, 2, 3... 100. 1, 2, 3... 5. HEY! HEY, LOOK! DADDY SPANKED MAMA!

YES, LIVVY DID SAY YOU WERE SIGNING A POWERFUL NEW PREACHER. YOU COULD COME SUNDAY TO HEAR HIM. LORD, IF I WAS TO WALK INTO THAT CHURCH, THE ROOF WOULD FALL IN ON THE WHOLE CONGREGATION. YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE JOKES ABOUT CHURCH, CLAY. DON'T YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR SOUL SO YOU CAN TO GO TO HEAVEN AND BE WITH LIVVY AND DECENT PEOPLE WHEN YOU DIE? AH, MOTHER IDA, YOUR CHURCH GOT ONE IDEA OF HEAVEN, THE METHODISTS GOT ANOTHER, AND THE CATHOLICS STILL ANOTHER. I GOT MY OWN OPINION, TOO. YES, I CAN JUST IMAGINE YOUR IDEA OF HEAVEN... A FISHING POLE AND A RIVERBANK. YES, I GUESS THAT'S PART OF IT. I GUESS I GET A LITTLE HEAVEN 'BOUT EVERY DAY. MAYBE IT'S JUST HAULING OFF AND KISSING MY WIFE OR HAVING ONE OF MY BABIES SNUGGLE INTO BED WITH US AT NIGHT OR JUST DOING A GOOD DAY'S WORK ON MY HOUSE UP ON SPENCER'S MOUNTAIN. NO, I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT, MOTHER IDA. I GOT HEAVEN RIGHT HERE. I WAS A DEVOTEE OF ISAAC WALTON WHEN I WAS BUT 6. ISAAC WALTON? LIVE AROUND HERE? ACROSS THE WATER. OH. A CENTURY OR SO AGO HE WROTE THE COMPLETE ANGLER. LET YOU IN ON A SECRET.

MY WEAKNESS IN THE EYES OF GOD COULD MEAN THE END OF MY MINISTRY, AND I AM DEEPLY CONTRITE. Clay: MOTHER IDA, I'M SURE SORRY I GOT YOUR PREACHER TIGHT YESTERDAY. THE THING IS, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS YOUR PREACHER TILL IT WAS TOO LATE. IT'S A WONDER THE GOOD LORD DON'T STRIKE YOU DEAD. NOW, IDA, I DON'T SEE ANY HARM IN A MAN TAKING A NIP NOW AND THEN. HE'S A GOOD MAN. BET HE DOES A LOT OF GOOD FOR THIS COMMUNITY. WAS HE POWERFUL IN THE PULPIT? DID HE PREACH A GOOD SERMON? HOW WOULD WE KNOW? WE ALL WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN CHURCH. NOBODY WENT TO THE CHURCH OF GOD THIS MORNING, POP. NOT A SINGLE, SOLITARY PERSON. WHY NOT? WOULD YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO HEAR A DRUNKARD PREACH? A DRUNKARD? THAT POOR GUY NEVER EVEN SMELLED A CORK TILL YESTERDAY. YOU MEAN TO SAY NOT ONE SINGLE HYMN-SHOUTING, FOOT-WASHING HYPOCRITE SHOWED UP? HUSH, CLAY. THE NEIGHBORS. PLEASE. THE LADIES AID SOCIETY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO TRANSFER IN TOTO TO THE MOUNTAIN CHURCH. WHY, THOSE PRISSY-PANTED HYPOCRITES. DON'T WAIT DINNER FOR ME. WHERE YOU GOING? I GOT THAT PREACHER INTO THIS. I'M GONNA HIM OUT. GOOD MORNING, CLAY. HEY, FOLKS. HOW ARE YOU? YOU FOLKS RECALL, DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS, EVERY TIME YOU NEEDED ANYTHING FIXED, YOU ALWAYS CALLED ON ME? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE THE HANDIEST MAN WITH A TOOL I'VE EVER SEEN, CLAY. THANK YOU, MA'AM. REMEMBER HOW I WORKED ALL ONE WEEKEND TO GET YOUR WINDMILL TO WORKING? TIMES I FIXED YOUR PUMP? HELPED YOU PUT ON YOUR NEW ROOF? YOU'RE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, FOR A FACT. NOW ALL THAT'S ENDED. WHAT'S MORE, I'M SENDING YOU A BILL TOMORROW FOR EVERY STICK OF WORK I EVER DONE ON YOUR PLACE UNLESS... UNLESS EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU SHOWS UP AT THE CHURCH OF GOD SERVICES TONIGHT. BUT CLAY, I'LL BE EXPELLED FROM THE LADIES AID. DON'T YOU WORRY NONE ABOUT THE LADIES AID. I'VE FIXED ENOUGH ICEBOXES, WASHING MACHINES, AND ELECTRIC CORDS IN SIX MONTHS TO PUT THEM ALL INTO BANKRUPTCY. YOU SPREAD THE WORD, LUCY, REAL QUICK. I'M COLLECTING IN FULL FROM EVERYBODY WHO DON'T SHOW UP AT THAT CHURCH TONIGHT. I SEE YOU HAVE QUITE A CONGREGATION. YES. WELL, GOOD DAY, SIR. GOOD DAY, COLONEL COLEMAN. GOOD DAY, CLAY. DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE JOINING OUR CHURCH, TOO. AH, ME AND CHURCH DON'T MIX. I JUST GOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT BIG OLD FAMILY OF SKUNKS YOU SMELLED BACK THERE. YOU WANTED ME TO CLEAN OUT. I GOT THIS AWFUL FEELING THAT ALL OF THEM'LL SHOW UP UNDER YOUR CHURCH TONIGHT UNLESS... UNLESS WHAT? UNLESS YOU AND YOUR WHOLE FLOCK GOES UP TO THE HOUSE OF GOD TONIGHT JUST TO MAKE THAT NEW MAN KNOW HE'S WELCOME HERE. WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT'S THE CHRISTIAN THING TO DO? WELL, I'VE HEARD RUMORS... AW, HE NEVER HAD A DRINK IN HIS LIFE BEFORE I POURED IT DOWN HIM. I'D SURE HATE TO SEE YOUR WHOLE CONGREGATION GET STUNK UP TONIGHT. ONCE THEM SKUNKS START SPRAYING THEIR SKUNK JUICE AROUND, THEY SAY YOU NEVER GET THE STINK OUT. [CHURCH BELL RINGS] GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING. I'M DEEPLY HONORED. GOOD EVENING, MINISTER GOODSON.

THE SENIOR CLASS TEACHER MISS PARKER WILL PRESENT THE SCHOLARSHIP MEDAL. I HAVE BEEN TEACHING SCHOOL HERE IN NEW DOMINION FOR ALL OF MY TEACHING LIFE. MANY OF MY FORMER PUPILS NOW SIT BEFORE ME IN THIS AUDIENCE. I HAVE TAUGHT OUR BOYS AND GIRLS ABOUT THE BEAUTY AND WISDOM THEY CAN FIND IN BOOKS. I'VE TAUGHT THEM HOW OUR GOVERNMENT WORKS. I HOPE I HAVE INSTILLED IN THEM SOME IDEA OF THE MAJESTY AND WONDER OF PEOPLE GOVERNING THEMSELVES. I HAVE TRIED IN GEOGRAPHY TO TEACH THEM THAT THERE LIES AN ENORMOUS WORLD OUTSIDE... THAT DWARFS EVEN OUR IMMENSE VALLEY, A WORLD FULL OF OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND LEARNING AND ACHIEVEMENT. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, A YOUNG STUDENT COMES ALONG WITH A HUNGRY LOOK IN THE EYE... WHO'S NOT CONTENT JUST TO MEMORIZE FACTS, WHO WANTS TO KNOW, WHO HAS AN INQUIRING MIND, AND EVERYTHING HE LEARNS ONLY WHETS HIS APPETITE TO LEARN MORE. THE STUDENT WHO WILL NOW RECEIVE OUR HIGHEST AWARD IS SUCH A STUDENT. WILL CLAYBOY SPENCER PLEASE STEP FORWARD? BULLY FOR YOU, BOY! I WANT THE SPENCER FAMILY TO KNOW THIS. I HAVE TAUGHT YOUR BOY EVERYTHING I KNOW, BUT HE'S STILL HUNGRY. IF THE DAY EVER COMES WHEN I GO BY THAT QUARRY, AND I SEE CLAYBOY SPENCER COVERED WITH DUST INSTEAD OF LEARNING TO BE A LEADER, I THINK I SHALL GIVE UP THE TEACHING PROFESSION. CLAYBOY, I GIVE YOU THESE WORDS TO LIVE BY. THE WORLD STEPS ASIDE TO LET ANY MAN PASS IF HE KNOWS WHERE HE'S GOING. Livvy: CLAYBOY! WHAT YOU DOING OUT THERE? WAITING FOR POP. WELL, YOUR SUPPER'S ON THE TABLE. YOU THINK POP'S GETTING DRUNK? HE DOES HAVE CAUSE TO CELEBRATE. IT ISN'T EVERY NIGHT THAT A SPENCER HAS A BOY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL, LET ALONE WIN THE SCHOOL MEDAL. WE CAN'T WAIT SUPPER MUCH LONGER FOR HIM. THE CHILDREN ARE STARVING. COME ON. IF HE'S DRUNK, I'LL DIE. OH, HE NEVER GETS THAT DRUNK. MOTHER. TONIGHT, MISS PARKER AND THE PREACHER ARE COMING TO CALL. WELL, I WANTED TO KEEP IT A SECRET. BUT NOW I CAN'T. KEEP WHAT A SECRET? THEY THINK THEY CAN GET ME A COLLEGE EDUCATION. WELL, I VOW. SOMETIMES EDUCATED PEOPLE'S GOT LESS BRAINS THAN FOOLS. WOULDN'T YOU WANT ME TO GO? I'D RATHER YOU GO TO COLLEGE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD, BUT JUST WHERE DO THEY THINK WE COULD RAISE THAT KIND OF MONEY? WHEN YOUR FATHER EVEN HAD TO WORK OVERTIME TO GET YOU A GRADUATION RING. DID YOU EVER SEE UNIVERSITY BOYS? THEY'RE... THEY'RE RICH BOYS... THEIR DADDIES HAVE GOT MONEY, OR ELSE THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET 'EM INSIDE THE GATES. BUT THEY THINK THEY CAN GET ME A SCHOLARSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE COMING TO TALK ABOUT. OH, SO YOU THINK I'M SO DUMB THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT SCHOLARSHIPS ARE FOR? THEY'RE FOR TUITION, BUT THAT DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF HALF OF THE EXPENSES. YOU STILL HAVE TO LIVE, YOU HAVE TO EAT. YOU HAVE TO WEAR DECENT CLOTHES, YOU HAVE TO BUY HUNDREDS OF BOOKS... WE'RE POOR PEOPLE, SON. I COULD GET A JOB NIGHTS. I COULD EARN MONEY HERE ALL SUMMER. THAT'S WISHING FOR THE MOON, CLAYBOY. MOM, ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT YOU AND POP HEAR WHAT THEY GOT IN MIND. IF THEY'VE GOT IN MIND SOME WAY TO RAISE THIS KIND OF MONEY TO GET YOU THIS COLLEGE EDUCATION, THEN I'M ALL FOR IT, BUT IF THEY'RE COMING HERE TO PUT FOOLISH, HOPELESS IDEAS INTO YOUR HEAD... JUST LISTEN! THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. IF POP'S DRUNK... I'LL KILL MYSELF. ALL WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT IS PRAY, SON. NOW, WHOSE TURN IS IT TO SAY THE BLESSING? IT'S MY TURN. THANK YOU FOR THE FOOD WE EAT. THANK YOU FOR THE WORLD SO SWEET. THANK YOU, GOD, FOR THE BIRDS THAT SING. THANK YOU, GOD, FOR EVERYTHING, INCLUDING GETTING CLAYBOY GRADUATED. AMEN. BECKY DIDN'T SAY AMEN. I DID, TOO, SAY AMEN. YOU DID NOT IF NOBODY HEARD YOU. THAT'S BECAUSE I WHISPERED IT. WHY DID SHE WHISPER IT FOR? WELL, I WANTED TO SEE IF GOD COULD HEAR ME. DID HE HEAR YOU? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I'M TESTING HIM. OF COURSE HE HEARD HER. GOD HEARS EVERYTHING. I HOPE HE DIDN'T HEAR MATT TODAY. YOU'D BETTER SHUT YOUR YAP, IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU. WELL, THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK TO YOUR SISTER. MATT'S GOING TO HELL. TODAY HE MASHED HIS FINGER AND SAID A WHOLE STRING OF BAD, BAD WORDS. LIKE WHAT? HE SAID, "DAMN, DAMN, DOUBLE DAMN, TRIPLE DAMN, HELL." DID YOU, MATT? DADDY SAYS IT ALL THE TIME. THE NEXT TIME I HEAR YOU SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I WILL WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH LYE SOAP. I DON'T WANT MATT TO GO AWAY. MATT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. NOW EAT UP YOUR SOUP. GO ON. HE IS, TOO. BECKY SAID SO. Becky: HE'S GOING TO HELL FOR SAYING BAD WORDS. I WANT TO GO, TOO. I WANT TO GO TO HELL WITH MATT. AAH! LOOK OUT! OHH! OH, MY GOD! HIS NECK'S BROKE! RUN, CLAYBOY, QUICK, AND GET THE DOCTOR! MOTHER! HERE, CLAYBOY. YOU'D HARDLY BEEN GONE A MINUTE WHEN HE CAME TO. JUST KNOCKED THE BREATH OUT OF HIM, I GUESS. HOW DID YOU GET YOUR CLOTHES SO DIRTY? YOU LITTLE MUTT! WHAT DO YOU MEAN SCARING ME THAT WAY? OH, CLAYBOY DIDN'T MEAN THAT. OH, HUSH, CLAYBOY. CLAYBOY, GO ON UP AND SEE IF THE CHILDREN HAVE BRUSHED THEIR TEETH AND THEY'RE TUCKED IN... YOU DO IT! WHAT WAS THAT? MOM, I GOT TO GET AWAY FROM HERE. ALL I'M GOOD FOR IS RUNNING FOR DOCTORS, AND GOING TO THE STORE TO GET THINGS, AND FEEDING THE KIDS, PUTTING THEM TO BED, AND GIVING THEM BATHS, AND MILKING THE COWS, AND PLUCKING THE CHICKENS, AND THEN CHURNING THE BUTTER, AND... BUT YOU'RE THE OLDEST SON. THEN I'M TIRED OF BEING THE OLDEST! WELL, THAT'S ONE THING I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. WHAT YOU GET IN LIFE IS WHAT YOU'RE STUCK WITH, AND YOU'RE STUCK WITH BEING OUR OLDEST. YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT. HERE, WILL YOU TAKE CARE OF PATTYCAKE? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I HAVE TO DO WEE-WEE. YOU KNOW WHERE THE BATHROOM IS. IT'S TOO HIGH. WON'T YOU LIFT ME UP? [SIGHS] OH, ALL RIGHT. [KNOCK ON DOOR] COME IN. I TOLD MOTHER YOU'D BE COMING. HI THERE, PATTYCAKE. HI. CLAYBOY'S GOING TO LIFT ME ON THE TOIDY. [WHISPERING] Mother! YES? They're here. Oh! Entertain them. I'll hurry. I WAS JUST SAYING TO MR. GOODSON THAT SOMEONE AROUND HERE CERTAINLY HAS A GREEN THUMB. IT'S MOTHER. SHE LOVES TO GROW THINGS. I MUST FIND OUT THE SECRET OF HER SUCCESS. IT'S MOSTLY COW MANURE. I, UH, TRUST BOTH YOUR PARENTS WILL BE HERE. WELL, DAD HAD THIS SUDDEN WORK COME UP DOWN AT THE MILL, AND, UH... GOOD EVENING, MRS. SPENCER. GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING. I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU BOTH, AND, MISS PARKER, I WAS SO PLEASED TODAY TO HEAR ALL THE FINE THINGS YOU HAD TO SAY ABOUT CLAYBOY. THEY WERE ALL TRUE. I'M JUST SO SORRY THAT MR. SPENCER CAN'T BE HERE. YOU SEE, HE'S GONE TO JACKSON ABOUT SOME... PIGS THAT HE WAS GOING TO BUY. Pattycake: CLAYBOY... NOW WOULD YOU TUCK ME IN? [WHISPERING] What are you kids doing here? Listening. Listening. Back to bed, all of you. And if you get up another time tonight, I'm gonna spank your behind so shiny that you'll see yourself in it. I LOVE YOU, CLAYBOY. KISS ME GOOD NIGHT. Ok, now you go upstairs. SO AFTER THE GRADUATION, I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF CALLING THE UNIVERSITY LONG DISTANCE. AND THERE IS ONE SCHOLARSHIP LEFT IF CLAYBOY GETS IN HIS APPLICATION IMMEDIATELY. HOWEVER, AS I TOLD CLAYBOY, THE SCHOLARSHIP AVAILABLE IS OF A RATHER SPECIALIZED NATURE. BUT IT IS AN EDUCATION. THE ONLY SCHOLARSHIP LEFT IS ONE FOR STUDYING AS A MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL. OH. WELL, THAT DOES IT. HIS FATHER WOULD JUST BLOW UP. I UNDERSTOOD CLAY TO SAY HE HAD A GREAT RESPECT FOR EDUCATION. OH, HE HAS... BUT I'M AFRAID HIS FATHER WOULD RATHER SEE CLAYBOY BURN IN HELL THAN BECOME A MINISTER. HE ALLOWS YOU TO ATTEND CHURCH. YOUR CHILDREN GO TO SUNDAY SCHOOL. CLAY WAS NEVER ONE TO FORBID US FROM SEEKING GOD IN OUR OWN WAY. IT'S JUST THAT... Clay: ♪ BABBLING BROOK ♪ ♪ A SHADY NOOK ♪ ♪ A GIRL ALL DRESSED IN YELLA ♪ ♪ OH, WHAT A PIP ♪ ♪ WHAT RUBY LIPS ♪ ♪ OH, WHAT A LUCKY FELLA ♪ MUST YOU? WE GOT COMPANY.

CLAY, STOP. STOP, CLAY. I LOVE YOU, WOMAN. OH, CLAY, STOP... HI, DOC. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? ACCORDING TO MY BLACKBOARD, DONNIE HAS A BROKEN NECK. MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL ME. OH, NO, NO. DONNIE'S FINE. HE JUST HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF HIM. HE'S FINE, DOC, BUT DO COME IN, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME BLACK COFFEE FOR CLAY. AFTER THAT BIBB BIRTHING, I COULD USE SOME, TOO. WELL, HE BOUGHT THE PIGS AND GOT BACK. CLAYBOY, PLEASE GET A BIG BLACK POT OF BLACK COFFEE AND SOME CUPS. PLEASE SIT DOWN. MISS PARKER AND MR. GOODSON SEEM TO THINK THAT OUR BOY HAS A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING A SCHOLARSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY. SOME KIND OF CONTEST? NO. YOU JUST HAVE TO SIGN THIS APPLICATION. I'LL SEND A COPY OF HIS EXCELLENT SCHOLASTIC RECORD. I'M SURE THEY'LL ACCEPT HIM. I CAN WORK NIGHTS AND STUDY. COME HERE, SON. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE THIS VALLEY. YOU'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN A CITY LIKE WHERE THAT UNIVERSITY IS. THEY GOT... EVERYBODY'S IN A HURRY. THEY GOT FREEWAYS, CARS GOING EVERY WHICH WAY, AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. YOU'D GET LOST THE FIRST DAY. YOU COULD BUY ME A MAP. MAYBE HE WOULD GET LOST FOR A WHILE, BUT NOT FOR LONG. THAT BOY COULD FIND HIS WAY THROUGH LIFE, IF YOU'LL GIVE HIM THAT CHANCE. Doc: I BROUGHT CLAYBOY INTO THE WORLD. I COULD SURE WRITE A CHARACTER RECOMMENDATION. I COULD, TOO. I GRADUATED FROM THERE. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. I NEVER HAD NO EDUCATION MYSELF. JUST WENT TO SCHOOL A COUPLE WEEKS, JUST LONG ENOUGH TO LEARN TO WRITE MY NAME, LEARN ENOUGH ARITHMETIC TO MAKE SURE THE COMPANY WASN'T CHEATING ME ON MY PAY. I WENT INTO THE QUARRY ALONGSIDE MY PAPA WHEN I WAS 10 YEARS OLD. I'VE BEEN THERE EVER SINCE. MAYBE THAT'S WHY I ADMIRE A MAN WITH AN EDUCATION. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY HEART'S CRAVING FOR MY BABIES TO GET BETTER THAN I HAD. YOU REALLY WANT IT, DON'T YOU, BOY? YES, SIR. WHAT IF YOU GO DOWN THERE AND FALL ON YOUR BUTT? I'D NEVER LET YOU DOWN, POP. YOU WILL SIGN HIS APPLICATION. I SURE AS HELL WILL. RUN AND GET THE COFFEE, QUICK. THE OLD WOMAN'S SHAKING HER HEAD AT ME FOR CUSSING. I'LL TELL YOU, MA'AM, I LEARNED TO CUSS BEFORE I LEARNED TO WALK. I'M TOO OLD A ROOSTER TO CHANGE MY WAYS AT THIS LATE A DATE. I ALWAYS SAY IN HIS OWN HOME, A MAN'S GOT A RIGHT TO TALK THE ONLY WAY HE KNOWS HOW. THEM THAT DON'T LIKE IT CAN ALWAYS MARCH THEIR TAIL RIGHT OUT. THAT RIGHT? DAMN TOOTIN'! HERE'S TO THE WORLD OUTSIDE, BOY. DID YOU SEE WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I HAD WRITTEN INSIDE YOUR RING? "VICTORY WITH HONOR." IT'S ONE OF THEM MOTTOES. MOTHER PICKED IT OUT OF A BOOK. [KNOCK ON DOOR] COME IN. WELL, MISS PARKER. LAST TIME YOU CAME CALLING WAS TO TELL ME MY DAUGHTER SIMPLY HAD TO WEAR PANTIES TO SCHOOL. WELL, I SUPPOSE NOW THAT SUMMER VACATION'S HERE, WE'LL BE SEEING CLARISSE ANY DAY NOW. UH-HUH. COLONEL COLEMAN, YOUR COMPANY OWNS THAT OLD, ABANDONED SHACK ACROSS FROM THE OFFICE. ON FRIENDSHIP CORNER. OH, I'M GONNA BOARD IT UP. THE MEN USE IT FOR GAMBLING AND DRINKING AFTER WORK, INSTEAD OF GOING HOME. I HAVE A BETTER USE FOR IT... A LIBRARY. YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING. HALF THE PEOPLE HERE CAN BARELY WRITE THEIR NAMES. MR. GOODSON AND I ARE GOING TO SOLICIT EVERY LIBRARY IN THE STATE FOR DUPLICATES. WE'RE GONNA PRINT PLEAS IN THE PAPERS... OK, THE SHACK IS YOURS, IF YOU CLEAN IT OUT YOURSELF. THANK YOU. NOW, HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO PAY CLAYBOY SPENCER TO RUN IT FOR YOU? PAY HIM? TO RUN IT FOR ME? I THINK YOU SHOULD PAY HIM $20 A WEEK. IF THE COMPANY HEARD I PAID $20 A WEEK TO A LIBRARIAN, THEY'D FIRE ME. CHARGE IT TO PUBLIC RELATIONS! IF YOU WERE A MAN, I'D THROW YOU THROUGH THAT DOOR. HIDE IT UNDER "MISCELLANEOUS." BECAUSE HE'S CLAY SPENCER'S SON, I'LL GIVE HIM $10 A WEEK, NOT A CENT MORE. WHY, THAT'S ONLY $120 FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER. IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT THAT OFFER, MISS PARKER, AND GET OUT OF HERE, I'LL HAVE THAT SHACK BURNT DOWN TODAY. TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. I'LL TAKE IT. THIS IS A LOVELY PLACE YOU HAVE HERE. IT'S PRETTY GHASTLY, ALL RIGHT, BUT IT'LL DO. WE CAN START CLEANING IT UP. HEAVE HO! Miss Parker: THEY'VE COME! THEY'VE COME! BEAUTIFUL. GREEN MANSIONS. WAR AND PEACE. I BOUGHT YOU A PRESENT. HEY, HOW'D YOU LIKE TO READ A GOOD BOOK? NOPE. WHAT'S THE PASSWORD? GOBBLEDYGOOK. IS THAT ALL YOU'RE GOING TO SAY TO ME AFTER A WHOLE YEAR? WELL, YOU'VE GROWN. 34-22-34. WHAT'S THAT STAND FOR? WHAT YOU'RE GAWKING AT. AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ME IN? YEAH. COME ON IN. SAY, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT YOUR GOING TO COLLEGE? I HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION IN. WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR. MOTHER SAYS I'M AT THE DANGEROUS AGE, WHATEVER THAT IS. SHE STUCK ME IN A GIRLS' ACADEMY. WHAT WAS YOUR MAJOR? PHYS ED. PHYS ED? WHAT'S THAT? MURDER, YOU ARE DUMB. LOOK. 1... 2... 3... 4. 1... 2... 3... 4. THAT'S PHYS ED. YOU KNOW WHAT CLASS I LIKE BEST IN SCHOOL? UH-UH. MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY. BOY, OH, BOY, COULD I TELL YOU A THING OR TWO. WELL, GO AHEAD. I'D HAVE TO WHISPER. OK. HOW DO YOU SPELL IT? WHERE'S YOUR DICTIONARY? OH, I HAVEN'T GOT ONE. THERE WAS ONE AT SCHOOL. I USED TO SAVE UP THE WORDS FOR THEN. THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS IN THE WHOLE WORLD ARE THE BIBLE AND THE UNEXPURGATED DICTIONARY. I'LL BUY YOU ONE, AND WE CAN LOOK UP WORDS TOGETHER. WE'LL EXPAND YOUR VOCABULARY. LAST YEAR I WAS AS DUMB AS YOU ARE. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING. NOW I KNOW EVERYTHING. ASK ME SOMETHING. WELL, THERE'S NOTHING I WANT TO KNOW... RIGHT AT THIS MINUTE. AREN'T YOU EVEN GOING TO KISS ME HELLO? I'M SURE GLAD YOU'RE HOME. ME, TOO. NOW I'M GOING TO RIDE UP AND HAVE A REUNION WITH YOUR FAMILY, SEE IF THE KIDS HAVE GROWN UP AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE. SEE YOU THERE, LOVER. BATH WATER'S READY. DONNIE TOOK HIS NAP IN THE FETAL POSITION. IN WHAT? FETAL POSITION. THE WAY HE WAS CURLED UP INSIDE YOUR WOMB. CLARISSE, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT SUCH THINGS IN THIS HOUSE. IT'S JUST THAT I'M TERRIBLY ENTHRALLED WITH HUMAN REPRODUCTION RIGHT NOW. WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FETUS FROM THE TIME THE SPERM AND THE EGG UNITE. SHH! THE ONLY EGGS THESE CHILDREN HEAR ABOUT COME FROM CHICKENS. I WAS ONLY TRYING TO MAKE INTERESTING CONVERSATION. THEN MAKE IT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. NOW THAT I'M HOME, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AND MR. SPENCER A WEEK'S VACATION. THAT'S ONE THING I'VE NEVER HAD. IT OUGHT TO BE REAL INTERESTING. BATHE AND DRESS ALL THE KIDS, MAKE THE DINNERS, WASH THE DISHES, MAKE THE BEDS, WHILE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND JUST GO OFF ON A SECOND HONEYMOON. WE HAVEN'T HAD THE FIRST ONE YET. CLAY ALWAYS SAID THAT WE WERE GONNA SPEND IT UP THERE AT THAT DREAM HOUSE, BUT... WELL... WHERE WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE GO? EVER BEEN TO SUN VALLEY? ONLY VALLEY I'VE EVER BEEN TO IS THIS ONE. THEN THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL GO. SUMMER'S NOT TOO EXPENSIVE, AND THERE'S SWIMMING, AND DANCING, AND SUNBATHING. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DRESS FOR DINNER. WELL, THAT'S REAL NICE TO KNOW. I'M SURE YOU'D ENJOY IT IMMENSELY. OH, I'M SURE I WOULD, DEAR, BUT I'D CONSIDER IT A VACATION IF I COULD JUST SIT DOWN FOR 10 MINUTES OUT THERE ON THAT PORCH. SURE YOU CAN'T STAY TO SUPPER? NO. FIRST NIGHT HOME. DADDY WILL BE... [WHISTLING] HERE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF DONNIE. YOU GO ON OUT AND LOOK AT THE SUNSET WITH CLAYBOY. GUESS WHAT? YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER ARE GOING TO SUN VALLEY ON THEIR SECOND HONEYMOON. AND YOU AND I ARE GONNA BE PAPA AND MAMA WHILE THEY'RE GONE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? WHAT DO I THINK? I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY. HERE'S A DICTIONARY WITH ALL THE NAUGHTY WORDS UNDERLINED. OH, I'VE SEEN ALL THOSE. LOOK AT THIS ONE. HOLY SMOKE. HOW DID YOU FIND THEM? STUDY HOUR. LOOK AT THAT. SOON AS YOU FIND OUT WHAT THEY ALL MEAN, BETTER ERASE THE UNDERLINE. I KNOW THEM ALL BY HEART ANYWAY. LOOK UP "FRICTION." THE GIRLS AT THE ACADEMY THOUGHT IT WAS A DIRTY WORD, SO THEY WENT AROUND SAYING, "FRICTION, FRICTION." IT DOES SOUND DIRTY. WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? ISN'T THAT A KICK? NOW IF YOU'LL JUST FRICTION ME A LITTLE, I'LL RIDE HOME TO SUPPER. YOU ARE NUTS. GO AHEAD, OR I'LL START SCREAMING. OK, SCREAM. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? JUST FRICTION ME FOR 10 SECONDS. THAT'S ALL YOU GET THIS TIME. Clay: LIVVY! LORDY, LORDY, IF LITTLE CLARISSE AIN'T GONE TURNED INTO A WOMAN. I'M SO PLEASED TO BE HOME. YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR CLAYBOY'S BIG MOMENT. COME IN. LIVVY! COME ON OUT! GATHER 'ROUND. HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS, HOT FROM THE POST OFFICE. "MR. CLAY SPENCER, JR." I NEVER SAW IT SPELLED OUT THAT WAY BEFORE. HAVE YOU, SON? WHY DON'T YOU OPEN IT? GOT YOUR NAME ON IT. WHAT IF THEY TURNED ME DOWN? THAT WOULDN'T BE THE END OF THE WORLD. WOULD BE FOR ME. Clay: OPEN IT, SON. TAKE IT LIKE A MAN, WHATEVER IT SAYS. "THE DEAN ANNOUNCES "THE FOLLOWING SELECTIONS FOR SCHOLARSHIP: LAWRENCE ADAMS..." IT'S ALPHABETICAL. SKIP TO THE Ss. THEY HAVEN'T GOT ALL THE EDUCATION IN THE WORLD LOCKED UP IN THAT ONE CHEESY UNIVERSITY. Grandpa: YOU COULD WRITE DOWN THERE AND ASK 'EM WHAT KINDS OF BOOKS THEY'RE TEACHING. YOU COULD SEND FOR 'EM, GET 'EM UP HERE, STUDY 'EM RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN FIREPLACE, LIKE HONEST ABE DID. MIGHT TAKE A BIT LONGER WITHOUT THEM PROFESSORS, BUT IT'S A WAY, BOY. IT'S A WAY. IF I HAD MY WAY, YOU'D BE PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES. Livvy: CLAYBOY, IT WAS LIKE REACHING FOR THE SUN, AND THE MOON, AND THE STARS, WASN'T IT, DEAR? MAYBE IT'S A MISTAKE. MAYBE IT'S ONE OF THEM CLERICAL ERRORS. WHO'S KIDDIN' WHO? THEY JUST DON'T WANT ME! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?! Grandma: TIME FOR SUPPER. COME ON. YOU, TOO, CHILDREN. IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL IF THE GOOD LORD HIMSELF KEPT CLAYBOY FROM GETTING THAT SCHOLARSHIP. WHY'D THE LORD WANNA DO THAT? AFTER THE GRADUATION, WE WERE ALL SO... SO PUFFED UP AND BRAGGING ABOUT HIM SO. WELL, PRIDE COMETH BEFORE A FALL. IF THE LORD PUT YOU ON THIS EARTH TO BE POOR, POOR YOU'RE GONNA BE. AND IF YOU'RE BORN IGNORANT, WELL, THEN, YOU'RE DESTINED TO DIE IGNORANT. WHERE THE HELL'D YOU PICK UP A PIECE OF INFORMATION LIKE THAT? IN THE BIBLE, AND YOU STOP SWEARING. SHOW ME WHERE IT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I-I CAN'T EXACTLY SHOW YOU WHERE, BUT I HEARD A PREACHER... WOMAN, YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO TOO MANY PREACHERS. LORD'S SAKE, ANYBODY IN THE WHOLE WORLD COULD FIND SOMETHING WROTE DOWN SOMEWHERE TO PROVE WHAT THEY WANT TO PROVE. JUST 'CAUSE IT'S WROTE DOWN, DON'T MAKE IT SO. OH, NOW YOU THINK YOU KNOW MORE THAN THE PREACHERS DO. MAYBE I DO, MAYBE I DON'T. MAYBE I AIN'T BEEN BAPTIZED OR NOTHING, BUT THE GOOD LORD MY MAMA TOLD ME ABOUT, AND THE ONE I BEEN SAYIN' MY PRAYERS TO AIN'T THE ONE WHO'D SET HIS FOOT DOWN ON ANY OF MY KIDS TRYING TO BETTER HIMSELF IN THIS WORLD. WHAT HURTS MOST IS KNOWIN' THERE MUST BE THOUSANDS OF BOYS IN COLLEGES EVERYWHERE WHO DON'T HAVE HALF THE HEART OR MIND OR CRAVIN' TO LEARN OUR BOY HAS. THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF FROM THE START, THAT MISS PARKER AND THE PREACHER WOULD OPEN A WINDOW FOR CLAYBOY AND SHOW HIM THE WORLD OUTSIDE AND MAKE HIM WANT IT WITH ALL OF HIS HEART AND ALL OF HIS SOUL, AND THEN JUST SLAM IT SHUT IN HIS FACE. GOD FORGIVE ME, I HATE THEM FOR LETTING OUR BOY GET HURT LIKE THAT. I THINK I'M GETTING ME DRUNK. AIN'T GOING TO TAKE THIS LYING DOWN. NO SPENCER EVER DID. NOBODY GOING TO TELL MY BOY THERE AIN'T ROOM FOR HIM OUTSIDE THIS VALLEY. NOSIREE. GOING DOWN THERE AND TALK TO THIS DEAN FELLOW WHO TURNED DOWN MY BOY. YOU DO THAT, CLAY. I'LL MAKE YOU A LOAN OF MY PICKUP TRUCK. WON'T EVEN LET YOU IN THE GATE, CLAY. THEY'RE EDUCATED. I'VE TALKED TO LOTS OF EDUCATED PEOPLE IN MY TIME. LOTS OF 'EM MAKE MORE SENSE THAN SOME IGNORAMUSES I KNOW. THANKS FOR THE LOAN OF THE TRUCK. [SIREN] [WHISTLE BLOWS] WHEN YOU HEAR THAT SIREN, YOU PULL OVER AND STOP. YOU HEAR? THERE'S A MAN BLEEDING IN THERE. YOU'LL BE BLEEDIN' RIGHT HERE IF... YOU THINK HE'LL LIVE? HOW SHOULD I KNOW? I DO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE LONG DRIVING LIKE THIS. I WAS TRYING TO FIND THE UNIVERSITY. YOU'RE RIGHT IN FRONT OF IT. I WAS LOOKING FOR THE BOSS OR FOREMAN, WHOEVER RUNS THE PLACE. THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. THE BOSS MAN WORKS IN THERE. NOW GET OVER THERE. OVER HERE. MORNING, MA'AM. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE HEAD MAN. WHAT ABOUT, SIR? MY BOY'S CLAY SPENCER JR., AND WE PUT IN FOR THIS SCHOLARSHIP, AND WE DIDN'T GET IT. AND I COME DOWN TO FIND OUT WHY. OH. YES, SIR. JUST A MOMENT. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK, SIR. WELL, THEY LOOK SMART, BUT I WONDER IF ANY OF THEM EVER DID AN HONEST DAY'S WORK. PLEASE GO IN, MR. SPENCER. I REMEMBER YOUR SON'S CASE VERY WELL. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? I'D LIKE YOU TO GIVE MY BOY ANOTHER CHANCE AT THEM SCHOLARSHIPS. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'RE ALL GONE. WHERE'D MY SON FAIL? FAIL? NOWHERE. HIS GRADES, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND QUALIFICATIONS WERE EXCELLENT. BUT HE HAD ONE INSURMOUNTABLE DEFICIENCY... HE HAD NO LATIN. LATIN IS AN ABSOLUTE PREREQUISITE FOR HIS CHOSEN VOCATION. WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, PLEASE? MAY I REMIND YOU THAT MANY OF AMERICA'S GREAT MEN NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE? THAT WON'T BE MUCH COMFORT FOR MY BOY. IT AIN'T ONLY FOR HIMSELF. BUT HE'S GOT THIS DREAM OF LEADING THE WAY FOR HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE? I GOT 9 OF THE FINEST KIDS YOU EVER SEEN. I BROKE MY BACK TO KEEP 'EM ALL IN SCHOOL. BUT I SWORE TO ALMIGHTY GOD THAT EVERY ONE OF 'EM HAVE WHAT I NEVER GOT. WHICH IS? HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. MY FIRST-BORN'S MADE IT WITH HONORS, BUT NOW HE'S GOT THIS DEEP CRAVING FOR MORE. HIS MAMA AND ME WOULD MAKE ANY SACRIFICE TO SEE HE GETS IT. I'M SURE IF YOUR SON WANTS TO BE A MINISTER STRONGLY ENOUGH... WANTS TO BE WHAT? IF HE WANTS TO PREACH THE GOSPEL. HE DON'T WANT TO PREACH NO GOSPEL. HE JUST WANTS A COLLEGE EDUCATION. BUT HE APPLIED FOR A MINISTERIAL SCHOLARSHIP, AND YOU SIGNED IT. FRIEND, SOMEBODY'S GOT THINGS ROYALLY FOULED UP. I'D AS SOON SEE MY BOY IN JAIL AS HAVE A PULPIT. THAT'S SEEMS A STRONG STATEMENT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST PREACHERS? IT'S WHAT THEY PREACH AGAINST I'M AGAINST. I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY'RE AGAINST EVERYTHING I'M FOR. THEY DON'T ALLOW DRINKING OR SMOKING, CARD PLAYING, POOL SHOOTING, DANCING, CUSSING, OR HUGGING, KISSING, AND LOVING, AND, MISTER, I'M FOR ALL OF THEM THINGS. I GOT ME A GOOD, GOD-FEARING WIFE. AND I LET HER BRING UP OUR KIDS THAT WAY, BUT I'LL BE TRIPLE-DAMNED IN HELL BEFORE I'LL HAVE A PARSON IN MY FAMILY. THAT SEEMS PRETTY FINAL. DON'T YOU TEACH NOTHING ELSE AROUND HERE BESIDES THIS PREACHING BUSINESS? OH, YES. WE TEACH AGRICULTURE, HORTICULTURE, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, LAW, MEDICINE, BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE ARTS. GOOD. IF MY BOY LEARNS HIMSELF THIS LATIN BEFORE COLLEGE STARTS, WILL YOU LET HIM IN? THERE'LL BE NO MORE SCHOLARSHIPS THIS YEAR. HE'D HAVE TO PAY HIS WAY. IF I CAN SWING IT, WILL YOU TAKE HIM? WHAT IF THE ANSWER WERE NO? WELL, THIS AIN'T THE ONLY GOL-DURN COLLEGE IN THE COUNTRY. SIR, I JUST DON'T WANT TO BREAK MY BOY'S HEART. I DON'T THINK YOU'LL NEED TO, NEIGHBOR SPENCER. IF YOUNG CLAY CAN COMPLETE HIS LATIN, ING LIKE HIS FATHER, I THINK HE'D BE AN ASSET TO ALL OF US. THANK YOU, SIR. BRAVO. WELL, WHAT ELSE COULD I DO? HE'S RIGHT. THIS AIN'T THE ONLY GOL-DURN COLLEGE IN THE COUNTRY. OH, SORRY. I THOUGHT CLAYBOY WAS HERE. I FOUND OUT WHY THE COLLEGE WOULDN'T LET HIM IN. NO LATIN. OH, MY. THEN THAT WAS MY FAULT. I'VE NEVER TAUGHT IT. I TALKED TO THIS NICE FELLOW BECK. DEAN BECK? SEEMS AS IF SOME FOOL NOTION THAT CLAYBOY WANTED TO BE A PREACHER. THEY GOT THAT FOOL NOTION FROM ME. YOU SEE, MINISTRY SCHOLARSHIPS WERE THE ONLY ONES LEFT. WE THOUGHT THAT WHAT MATTERED MOST WAS CLAYBOY'S CONTINUING HIS EDUCATION. WELL, DON'T WORRY. I SQUASHED THAT PREACHER IDEA RIGHT AWAY. DEAN SAYS THAT IF CLAYBOY GETS HIS LATIN SOME WAY, HE CAN CHOOSE HIS OWN TRADE. I WON THE LATIN MEDAL WHEN I WAS THERE. I COULD TEACH HIM WHAT I KNOW. YOU COULD CERTIFY HE STUDIED THE COURSE, PASSED THE EXAMINATIONS. DEAN BECK OUGHT TO HONOR THAT. HE TAUGHT ME LATIN. GAVE ME A+. WHAT WOULD YOU CHARGE TO TEACH HIM? CHARGE? AFTER YOU SAVED ME A WHOLE CONGREGATION? WE'LL CALL IT BREAD ON THE WATER. DON'T GIVE ME THAT BIBLE STUFF. NO, SIR, WE MAKE A FAIR AND SQUARE DEAL. WELL, I KNOW WHAT WOULD BE FAIR FOR ME. I TRUST YOU. WHAT'S FAIR FOR YOU'S FAIR FOR ME. YOU NAME IT, I PAY IT. YOU INSIST? THEN THE ONLY PAYMENT I WANT IS TO SEE YOU AT OUR CHURCH SUNDAYS. DO WE HAVE A DEAL? THANKS, PREACHER. THANKS VERY, VERY MUCH. OH, ISN'T IT WONDERFUL? WHY, MISS PARKER, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CARED. OH, I DO. I DO! [CHURCH BELL RINGS] LOOK! NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE THE DAY. PAY UP, GUZZLER. HE AIN'T GONE IN YET. SAY IT ISN'T SO, CLAY. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT IT IS. IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU HEATHENS NONE TO COME ON IN, TOO. [ORGAN PLAYS BRINGING IN THE SHEAVES] COLONEL.

WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? I BROUGHT US UP A PICNIC. WHERE WILL WE SLEEP? YOU KILL ME. COME KISS ME IN THE BEDROOM. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'LL BE. COME UP HERE, AND WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. SEEMS KIND OF INDECENT. WHAT DOES? KISSING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. WELL, THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SEXY. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME UP HERE. YOU COULD FALL THROUGH AND BREAK YOUR NECK. IT IS A LONG WAY DOWN. HOLD ME. WELL, WHY'D YOU COME UP HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? SO WE COULD DO THIS. DO YOU ALWAYS PLAN THINGS? ONE OF US HAS TO. LIKE OUR PICNIC. I PLANNED WHERE WE'LL HAVE IT. WHERE? AT YOUR SECRET PLACE. IS THAT ALL YOU WANT TO DO THERE? NO... WE COULD EAT FIRST. CARRY ME DOWNSTAIRS. COME ON. OR AM I TOO HEAVY? COURSE NOT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. I KNOW WHAT'S BEEN ON YOUR MIND EVER SINCE YOU PLANNED THIS PICNIC. I DIDN'T PLAN IT, YOU DID! THAT'S RIGHT... BLAME IT ON ME. IT'S BEEN ON YOUR MIND EVER SINCE I MENTIONED THE SECRET PLACE. I KNEW YOU WANTED TO GET ME THERE SO YOU COULD TRY SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT, THEN LET'S NOT GO. DON'T WORRY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WILLPOWER, I DO. LEAD ME TO IT. WELL, HERE IT IS. LOOK. SOMETHING'S BEEN HERE. OH, ONLY A DEER. THAT'S WHERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT. IT'S STILL WARM FROM ITS BODY. NO, IT'S BEEN GONE SINCE SUNUP. IT'S JUST WARM FROM THE SUN. WE'LL HAVE OUR PICNIC HERE. COME. JUST THINK, ONLY A FEW SHORT HOURS AGO, SOME WILD, BEAUTIFUL THING LAY HERE. AND NOW LOOK. IT'S NOT LIKE HIM TO MISS SUPPER. WE USED TO STOP AND SMOOCH A LITTLE ON THE WAY, REMEMBER? WE NEVER DID SMOOCH. NOT BEFORE MARRIAGE. DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY SMOOCHING. IT MEANS MAKING LOVE. NOT REALLY. ONLY AROUND THE EDGES, LIKE YOU USED TO LET ME. STOP IT, CLAY! STOP! THE KIDS WILL SEE US. OH, I WISH I'D NEVER TOLD HER THAT YOU SENT HIM UP THERE. NOTHING THEY CAN DO UP THE MOUNTAIN THEY CAN'T DO BEHIND OUR OWN MORNING GLORIES RIGHT THERE. I WAS AT THE HOUSE, SEE? AND ME AND CLARISSE, WE HAD THIS PICNIC, AND EVERYTHING'S FINE UP THERE, DAD. I MEAN, IT'S OK. YOUR SUPPER'S IN THE OVEN. NOT HUNGRY. NOT HUNGRY? WELL, THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM. DID... DID HIS FACE SEEM SORT OF FLUSHED TO YOU? DO YOU THINK HE'S COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING? YEP. HELL OF A CASE OF FIRST LOVE. CLAYBOY WON'T LET ME IN THE BATHROOM. THEN YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT YOUR TURN. HE'S PUTTING OINTMENT ALL OVER HIM. OINTMENT? WELL, I... I THINK YOU BETTER GO UPSTAIRS AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. [KNOCK ON DOOR] LET ME IN, SON. WOW! THAT'S QUITE A SUNBURN. WOW! A LOT OF SUN. OH, WOW! BETTER LET ME GIVE YOU A HAND. YOUR MOTHER WAS WORRIED. ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL YOUR OLD MAN? LIKE WHAT, POP? WELL, WHEN A YOUNG LAD'S UP ON A MOUNTAIN MOST OF THE DAY WITH A LIVELY LITTLE FILLY LIKE CLARISSE, LEADS HIS MOTHER TO IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF THINGS.
