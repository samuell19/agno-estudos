It was midnight on the ocean, not a streetcar was in sight. The sun was shining brightly, and it rained all day that night. I don't get it. How could a streetcar be on the ocean, right? And not a streetcar was in sight. The sun was shining brightly... How can a car be in the water? Well, that's it, you see? The sun was shining brightly and it rained all day that night. Hey, which way do we go? I can't see. When I was little little, my father told me he tried marriage once, and he liked it so much, he never tried again. Guess he understood what he meant by that. I didn't. Yoo-hoo-hoo, whoo! Hee-hee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Oh, yes! Daddy looked tired today. Well, he's 10 years older than me. So? So, old is tired. That's what slobert probably thinks of you, 'cause you're much older than him. Whoa...isn't this perfect? Let's do it again and again and again. It's not a movie, mom. Let's just go. After my mom kicked my dad out, slobert moved in. My dad said slobert caught her on the rebound, which means, of course, my dad missed his shot. Slobert may have won that game, but he was a loser to me. If anybody calls you or anything, just ignore them. Keep on going. I would anyway. I mean, why stop? Okay. Oh, yeah! Girls, hey! Where do you think you're going? Whoo! Girls! What's up, delbert? Don't call me delbert. Hello, sausage. Hey, Louise. Don't call me deli, either. You know the rules. This'd better be important. It is. Good, 'cause I've got a job. They'll boot my ass, hmm? So? I need 10 bucks. 10 bucks for what? It's a girl thing. I'm a girl guy. Don't be so cheap, okay? Can't do anything, go anywhere. Robert, guys, come on. All right... But 10 bucks buys me a nice one on the cheek. Oh, come on. [ Humming ] Bye, slobert. Nice move, Adele. Yeah, slobert. She's just 12. Yeah, I was 12 once. My sisters were 12. Every girl was 12. We weren't necessarily shits. I don't know about that. Heading out, skipper? Yep. All right. We live on the east side up in the docks, in my grandma's old house. My mom says Vancouver is the most beautiful city in the world, but how would she know? She's never been anywhere else. What are we doing tomorrow? Um, I don't know. I'll phone you tomorrow sometime. Okay. Most of my friends have patched-up families, like mine. I have a half-brother and sister. At my house, everybody has a different last name. My mom knows a lot about divorce. She says happiness is not a fish you catch, but one you feed. She's full of little sayings. She's a human fortune cookie. Now, take off those glasses. Show me-- no. Compadres, que pasa? What happened to Joyce? Joyce is coming home. She's going to live here for a while. What about Eric? Is he going to live here, too? Not in my lifetime. Think I'll put the mower up, finish tomorrow. Doesn't that grass smell good? What did he expect? He spent all our money building this airplane, but it's not even a wing yet. Joyce... What happened? Oh, uh, he was angry, I was angry... And there was no food left, no soap, no phone, no nothin', you know? We were eating oats and potatoes. Well, lucky there weren't any children. Come on, we've got to get moving. There's leftover stew in the fridge. We'll have a nice supper together. It's good you left him, or else you would have died of malnutrition. Hey, ray, how's it going? Same shit. Hey. Make US up a couple of big ones, would you, baby? Mm-mmm. Jesus, ray. Oh, my god... That'd be an event, eh? Could you imagine that? Trying to find your way through all that oil and shit. Be good practice for my fat, fat wife. Merry's not fat, ray. She's pregnant. So your little sister came to visit me today. Oh yeah? What'd she want, some money? Which you gave her, naturally, daddy-o? Hey, if you give me what I want, I'll call you daddy, too. Sounds nice, doesn't it? Now get those-- oh, daddy, thank you. Sure. Thanks, baby. You're the best. Thanks a lot. Hey there, beauty. What in hell happened to Joyce? Hello, June. You look lovely tonight. Come here. Hello, June. You've been crying. Shit, you can tell. Of course I can tell. What happened? Why is Joyce wearing sunglasses? Beauty? I usually put cereal on the top, but I thought you wouldn't like that. Ooh-la-la. Joyce, let me see you, okay? Just take these things off. Just screw off, everybody. You can't let him get away with this. Call the cops, or I will personally go over there and cut his balls off with a dull razor. Thank you, Robert, but I do believe we have the situation under control, such as it is. Why don't you call the cops? No. No. We've got to change the mood in here. Come on, coconut. I know this great old song, but you know what? It's coming back. I heard it on the radio last night. It goes like this. ♪ Jada, Jada Jada, Jada, jing, jing, jing ♪ ♪ Jada, Jada Jada, Jada, jing, jing, jing ♪ ♪ that's a funny little bit of melody ♪ ♪ it's so soothing and appealing to me ♪ ♪ it goes Jada, Jada Jada, Jada, jing, jing ♪ ♪ Jada, Jada, jing, jing ♪ Jada, Jada jing, jing, jing ♪♪ Do it again. ♪ Jada, Jada ♪ Jada, Jada jing, jing, jing ♪ ♪ Jada, Jada... ♪ [ Honking ] Eric, get the hell away from here!

There's not a goddamn thing to throw at the son of a bitch! What happened to all the rocks that used to be all over the world, huh? Who thought it was a good idea to clean up all the friggin' rocks? What? What's going on? He'd better keep going, or... [ June singing ] [ Adele joining in ] Christ, Adele! Are we in timbuktu yet? What are you doing back there? I just didn't want to stay back there with him. He's acting like a complete lunatic, and Joyce, she's talking to her angels again. It's very hard starting all over again. I've done it twice, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Hmm. Let's go. Did you love my father? I tried to love him. As much as you love ray and Joyce's dad? Oh, totally different.

Yeah! Whoo-hoo! She could have gone to the top. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. June takes requests. Your favourites are my favourites. You know what I want to hear. Hi. Is Joyce here?

There's nails. Jesus, what a mess this place is. Listen and learn. When somebody hurts something of yours, you hurt that somebody back. But Joyce isn't yours. Nobody's yours. Nevertheless, there's a price to be paid. This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It's deserving. It's the right thing. No! Robert, no! Stop it. Robert... Oh, geez, oh, geez. Let's go. Take me to my father's. Oh, Jesus, I'll wait here for you. No reason. He's asleep, deli. Go away. He'll get up. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy? He must be out. Yeah. You'll see him next Saturday, though, right? You dick. Hey, deli fish, wait up. You want to go somewhere neat? Thanks. Just come down here... Real quiet, now. Oh, they're so pretty. You can say that again. Oh, my goodness, he's so pretty. Wow. What do you think? So beautiful. Wonder if they ever fight with their families. Well, they don't actually swim in families. They...they swim in pods. Which are like their families. Yeah, yeah, but not necessarily blood relatives. Hey... How do you know all this-- [ laughing ] How do you know all this stuff? I used to work here when I was a kid. So cute. Damn. Easy there, beauty. You'll electrocute yourself. Whoa. Jesus. Oh, god. Why do you get up with me every morning? Why do you ask me that every morning? Do I? Every morning. Well, every morning, I wonder about it. June takes requests. Oh, hey, I'll do that. You used to say things like, "I request that you lie on the floor, woman, and cover yourself with jam." I request that you-- too late. I'm too tired... And too old. Robert, Eric's coming to get you. Hey, oh, geez... Uh, he probably doesn't know yet. Know what? What? How should I know? Christ, you guys. Shh. Hey, ray. I'm going to check on Joyce. Would you be kind and get me something to drink, please? Okay. Water. My brother, ray, he's a dreamer. My mom says if he wants his dreams to come true, he's going to have to wake up. Eric, you hungry? Huh? Want some breakfast? I made you some toast. If only you'd choke on it. Oh, come on, Eric. I'll shove it down your throat, you son of a bitch. Oh, uh, morning, merry. Listen, merry, uh, ray was here last night. He was here all night. Ray's merry is quite contrary. She used to be mom's hairdresser until she got pregnant. Now she cooks and ray eats. Ray says life is too important to take seriously. This was your dinner last night-- pasta with homemade Pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, spicy Italian sausage...Mmm, and some exotic salad with nasturtium petal and macadamia nut dressing. Is there any dessert? Mm-hmm. No, no, no, wait, wait. Berry delight. Baby, I'm sick. I've been so sick. Oh, I can smell the beer. No, it's not that. I'm sick. No, you're full up with beer. I had a little fun. Oh, who was she? She was nobody. Nobody. She was a drink at the bar or two, you know? Who are you? I'm Joyce, merry. Ray's sister. Oh, hey, Joyce. How's it goin', eh? You look different. Uh, it is going just fine, merry. It's peachy-poo. Good, good. Yeah... So how's the old bun in the oven? Good, real good. Right on. Why are you doing this? Every night, a different woman. That is not true, babe. I had you paged. You weren't at the bar. What time? Midnight. I was here. I couldn't drive all that way. I was being responsible. If you loved me, you wouldn't drink. I do love you, and that is why I drink. Oh, good one. Oh, what's the point? You're like a dog in heat. I think he just likes to dance and stuff. Here you go. Oh, thank you. And you are a little stinky. You coming with me, ray? I'm sick. I'm calling in sick. [ Belching ] You understand me, don't you, kiddo? Mm-hmm. Whoa. Well, hello there. Guess somebody wants a ride, huh? Yeah. Let's go. You're a real horse's ass, ray. What the hell are you doing here, anyway? Robert, this has been my home a lot longer than it's been yours. Yeah. Let's go get 'em. Come on, partner. Hey. Hey. Family problems, family man? Sorry. You were supposed to be here by 8:00. I know. I told him you'd called in, that it was my mistake. Oh, thanks, Doris. Don't get yourself in any trouble, though. Ah, well, anything's possible. That me? Yeah. I'm updating the files for security, but that one doesn't really do you justice. You mind? I owe you. Ah, waste of beer. Here. Got it. Thanks again. You're going to crofton today. Next time, I'll go with you. Okay. Okay. Hey, bud, time for yours. Ready? Do you think Eric has a gun? I don't know. He's weird. That's so romantic. What? To love somebody so much that you want to kill them. I think it's dumb. I think he's dumb. If you love somebody, you should just set them free. We don't have to take our clothes off if we don't want to. Of course we do. It's natural. My bum's white. Mine too. Hi there. You girls want me to read your auras? No! Okay, no problem. Robert says you have to leave port to find home. When I leave, I won't be looking for a home or a husband. Why get married? I'd rather fight with a total stranger. ♪ ...all the crazy things you did ♪ ♪ right out beside the railroad tracks ♪ ♪ chasing that train ♪ like it was never coming back ♪ ♪ well, I'm still chasing that train... ♪♪ Wait a minute-- joycie, you'll have a great time with dietmar.

Yahoo! Where have you been? I was at the beach. It was great. We played with some kids... With their kite. Are you sure about that? Look me in the eye. I was at the beach. Honest. I don't know... I'm losing my touch. I've got to go. Where the hell is Robert? I don't know, and I don't care. Look, Adele, stay with Joyce. She's not herself. I don't want her left alone, you understand? She's in one of her moods. Good. Maybe you can get her to eat something. It's all ready. Yeah. Where's ray? He went home. He says he's going to paint the nursery. Isn't that nice? Mm-hmm. Bye. Bye, mom. The way I see it, Joyce let Eric into her heart. Now she can't get him out. Hey. Hey. So, about that beer... Oh, yeah, sure. Sit down. Chloe, get two, please? Thanks, Chloe. Just put it on my tab. Cheers. Cheers. I admire a man who pays his debts so promptly. Oh, yeah. Beauty? How was work? Oh... Turn over. I'll rub your back. Heaven. Marry me? Mm... It's time enough. Higher. It'd take you years to train somebody new. I don't think Adele is ready. What about you? Are you ready? I'm scared... Of messing up again. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Mm... Venture a little lower, will you? [ Laughing ] Vroom, vroom! Joycie? Oh, hey. Couldn't sleep. Joycie, no! Mom's flowers! Rrr... Stop, joycie, stop! Stop... Stop... Joycie... No, you don't cut the flowers. No. Where are you going? It's Saturday. How did you get here? I took the bus. Took the bus? Why didn't your mother drive you? Well, she says because it's only every second Saturday, it wouldn't be too much for you to come and pick me up. Well, that would be assuming, because your mother's assuming I have a working vehicle. Your mother's an assumer. What's the matter with your car, daddy? I don't know. Runs too fast. My dad moved out of the city. He said he wants to be left alone, that life is great. It's hard to believe someone who's always angry. My dad says love is the mask the devil wears when he's come to take your heart and soul. Robert wasn't the first man your mother ran around with, oh, no. She was an accomplished adulteress by the time she met him. Mommy's not an adulteress, daddy. Can I try? Be my guest. Careful, careful, stay in the centre. Well, good. She'll leave Robert for someone else, you watch. Robert'll be toast soon. Robert's just Robert, anyway. Mom said she would have left you whether Robert moseyed along or not. She said you weren't affectionate. Your mother'd blame the weather on me if she could. It was midnight on the ocean. Not a streetcar was in sight. The sun was shining brightly, and it rained all day that night. You remember that? No. You don't remember that? Is that what he said? Hmm. It had nothing to do with you what I thought of him. I wanted you. But how could you if you didn't love him? You are my life. All my babies... You are like the air that I breathe. I think you just got pregnant. Hey, there, beauty, deli fish. Welcome home, slobert. What now? Lookit. Look at what dietmar from work gave me. He had them in his trunk. I just love them. Maybe we could have a barbecue, and ray could bring his merry. Talk to me, beauty. What happened? What's going on? Adele wants to move in with her father. Oh, god. I don't know if I'm coming or going. Kids moving in and out... It won't last. [ Tires screeching ] [ Music blaring ] Jesus, that boy's thick. [ Music blaring ] What happened to his airplane? Um...I'm going to get something to eat. Should I go out and talk to him? No! That's a definite no. [ Gunshot ] [ Laughing ] Get down, beauty. Where'd you get that? On the ship, for shooting seagulls. Is it legal? It's just an air gun. What's he got on the back of his trailer? The wing off his airplane. He's trying to say something. He's trying to say, "shoot me. "I'm a stupid prick who loves my airplane more than my wife." Oh, shit! Take that, you piece of shit. Jesus! I remember this dress. Well, you'd better. Looks short. What? Always was a little. Well, you never said anything before. I guess my legs aren't good enough anymore. Now, now. You have great legs. Leg or breast? Maybe some coleslaw? Or special sauce? Come on, joycie. I went all the way to Broadway. Do you know how many dorks there are in chicken supremo on Broadway? I'm moving out of here, to my father's. My father, Humphrey? As opposed to your father, the pope? Har-har. Did you like my father? When we all lived with him? Did you? I was not in possession of all the facts. I know he wasn't like your and Ray's father. Hey, joycie. Dietmar says he has a friend who does fashion shows, star searches. They do a lot of movies here now, you know? Anyway, they also do conventions, promotions... You know, at supermarkets or-- I'm not putting on an apron and giving away cheese. A job would do you a world of good. You'd be independent, and meet people... I'm entitled to welfare. Not if you're living in this house. Mama don't allow no lazy folks in here. Hey, is this dinner? I took the money out of your wallet. Uh-huh. Well, we should eat at the table, eh, not just wherever, like bottom feeders. We like it here, don't we, joycie? Yeah. I don't know what we'd do with your room if you moved out, delbert. Is there any change? Why would Eric trash his plane like that? I don't know. Robert smashed it up. I was there. I couldn't believe it. Gee, Robert, what a good idea. Very provocative. You look nice. My mistake. Joycie... I'm glad he trashed his plane. Oh, my god, joycie. Daddy! Daddy-o, what's up? Dallyce, I'd like to introduce you to my father. He had me when he was 11. Hey, pops, want to spot me 20 bucks? Me and dallyce want to go get a room. Where's merry tonight, ray? What did I tell you? Right there, my father. He's joking about the room. "So where's merry tonight, son? I was a little concerned." I know about his wife and all. He's just a goof. Feeling better, ray? I heard you were sick. Thank you very much for asking, miss Doris. I'm feeling much better. What the hell are you doing out on a work night? Same as you. He just needs a break from his kids. He hasn't had them yet. No? The simple answer is no, ray. You can't bum 20 bucks. Your sister beat you to it. Fine. Screw it. [ Drink spilling ] Hey. May I? Have a seat. No. May I have this dance, sweetheart? Come on, I'll lead. Whoo! This it? Yeah. Home sweet home. It's cute. Good night. Want to play house? [ Chuckles ] What? You want to come inside with me? [ Turning engine off ] Listen, you know I wouldn't ask... I mean, I don't ask, except for that I know you never would. Right? Uh, well, if you don't want to come inside, then, uh... Would you mind taking me back to the parking lot so I can get my car? You wanted a ride. Yeah, I know. I lied. Bloody hell. Hey, don't panic. I like you Robert kiely, you know? And now you can't say that you never knew. Yeah, but I hear you're a liar. Poor baby.

You'll get something better. You'll sing your own stuff. I'll support US, and... I'll support myself. I'll sell the house. No. Why? I wrote you a note. What did it say? I, uh, didn't see it. I left it on the fridge. I didn't see it. Where were you? [ Tires screeching ] Is that Eric again? Where were you? I was out, beauty. I...i came home, nobody was here, I went out.

You just didn't feel like being here. Your hair looks nice. No, it doesn't. Don't lie to me. Every time I get my hair done, you lie to me. Okay, okay. You smell like soap. Why do you smell like soap? I had a shower. Where? Here, before I went out. Why would you do that? Why would you take a shower and then put your work clothes back on? Why would you do that? You haven't been home, have you? I want a bath... Now that I know the towels are clean. Hey... Why don't you go up to bed? I'm sorry. Hey, you're back. I can't stay. Yes, you can. Here's your key. June was waiting for me. We had a fight. How nice. Ever since I've known her, she's gone to the same hairdresser, and ever since I've known her, she comes out looking like a Nazi bride... And ever since I've known her, she always takes a bath afterwards to undo it all. That's very amusing. Hey... You can stay, you know? I want to know everything about you... Starting with what brought you to me. That'd be June. I'm sorry. It's all right. I was a sailor. She's why I got off the ship. You wouldn't have met me if she hadn't met me first. Oh, come on. Careful. You were looking for an excuse to jump ship. Most sailors are. Drink? Yeah. Jumping ship's a good thing, you know? Men aren't supposed to drift. It's unnatural. She was playing in a club on Robson. Thanks. Yep. She was singing to me. [ Car approaching ] Oh, yeah! Oh, I'm good at this. Yeah, you are. Yeah, I am. Excuse me. I thought you had a job. I did. Past tense. Oh. Oh, it's my shot. Ray, where's merry? I told her to come already. She's just afraid of you. Very funny. Geez, ray, you're going to have a baby. Don't you want it? Want it? Yeah, more than anything. How's it going to know that? It'll know. I mean, I'll make sure. It's something I'm going to do better than anything I've done in my whole life. I totally need a bigger towel. Yeah, no kidding. Your ass is hanging out. Shut up. You know, mom's right. She needs a man. That's what she needs. So who is coming to dinner? Dietmar. Dietmar of the gnomes. Whoo! [ ♪♪♪ ] Whoo! We can't eat these. Well, we agree on that. Why is dietmar here? Your solution to Joyce's problem is to attack Eric, provoke him. My solution is to offer up a little happiness. That's happiness? You are so superior... Judging me and my kids. Oh, beauty, come on-- I'm not listening. I'm ordering in. So, dietmar, do they have good Chinese takeout in Germany? No. We actually, uh... We actually don't ever get takeout. I mean, not usually. We don't usually get takeout. Oh. No. It's nice eating here in the garden. Yes. [ Humming ] You should be home, ray. I am. Where's home for you, Robert? Here, or over at your pussy pie's place across town? Whoops. What are you doing here? What is your function? Your son is an alcoholic. He is not an alcoholic. He just drinks too much. He'll grow out of it. Where are you going? I can't find my goddamn shoes. Humiliating me is one thing. Humiliating me in front of the children is something else. Children. You mean the drunk and the fruitcake? And Adele. What's Adele? What name do you call her? Have you ever called her by her name? [ Grunting ] [ Mattress squeaking ] Get out. Get out of here. Take your soapy smell. Take your... Take your simple stupidity and get out. Who is she? Hey, June, just wait. Shit! Beauty, come on! Hey. I'm kicked out. I can't come back in... And I can't, uh... I can't, uh...I can't leave. Would you get me a blanket? Would you do that for me? Thank you very much. Thanks. You want to talk? To who? Joycie? Is that man still in my room? Dietmar? Did he hurt you? No. I think I fell asleep... Joyce... ...and had a nightmare. You can sleep with me tonight. You know, when I was little little, I used to tell me when you sleep beside someone, you can breathe in their dreams. I could dream something for you. Hmm. I don't want anybody's dreams, del. I just want to fly to the moon and watch the world rotate. I want everybody to leave me alone. Oh. Hey, except for you. Come on, come here. Except for you. I want you to stay with me. Okay, why don't you dream me something? Dream me a dream, 'Kay? It would me much easier if we lived by our own instincts and did whatever came natural-- no shoulds, no shouldn'ts, just instinctual. [ Music blaring ] [ Horn honking ] Jesus. What are you doing here? I'm out of gas. Hey, why don't we invite Eric over? More's always fun at a sleepover, right? I don't know what I have to do to that asshole next. Yeah, he's pretty freakin' thick. Yeah, I might have to take a freakin' power drill to him. Hey, I've got a skilsaw in the back. What, I mean... What would you cut off first? Where would you start with a putz like that? He's a true and genuine loser, isn't he? Yeah...not like US. [ Laughing ] You know, I don't not like you ray. I don't not like you neither. Either. I think I said what I said, anyway. [ Knocking ] Come on, June, please. I need a change of clothes. June? Why is slobert sleeping in the doghouse? He's not in the doghouse. He's sleeping in his truck, because we don't have a doghouse. But why? Because men need women, women need men. There's nothing wrong with that, but I would still like to personally strangle Doris for what she has done to US. Doris from the docks? Doris nowicke. Nowicke? Yeah. Sticky nowicke. The fitness freak? That's his pussy pie? Don't talk like that. Don't use that word! He chose her over US. Not US, me! This has nothing to do with you. Robert loves you, but me, he's traded me in for a newer model. One good thing about Robert being gone, he doesn't have to hear you swear like that. It's dirty. Clean up this mess... Joycie, I've got to tell you something. ♪ It needs to be clean thank you very much ♪ It's dirty, dirty, dirty... [ Bird chirping ] Dirty bird, dirty bird. Okay. Joycie! What are you doing? What are you doing? Oh! Oh, Joyce! Oh! Corky, corky... Oh, corky, corky, corky... Corky, corky... Whoops. Oh, corky. Uh-oh. Joycie, it's okay. It's okay, see. It's a beautiful day. Why don't we go to the beach? I don't have any plans. You don't have any plans. It'll be like... You know, like when you were little. [ Ray ]: You saw me with dallyce at the bar? So what? That's like... Innocent flirting. I've never actually... [ Making mattress squeaking sounds ] I haven't even touched the girl. I go home. I don't want to go home. She gets paranoid. I've been so good. I've been totally clean. She just won't believe me no matter what I do. She won't believe you? As Adele would say--duh! 3003...i think it's in the next block. It's this one-- the yellow one. Louise, maybe this isn't such a good idea. It was your idea. It's a good idea. Hurry up. It's locked. Windows, windows, windows... Windows! It's locked. Louise! Louise, no! Yes. Ah! Ow. Oh, ow. No... Get in. It's dripping. Hurry up. Let's get something. I found something. Okay, let me do it. Okay. Ray? Ray! Raymond! Merry? Merry! Merry? You want to be pregnant? So you can do other women? Well, so much for that. The baby's gone, Raymond. Gone! Kaput-o! [ Glass shattering ] Louise? Louise? Louise, stop it. No! No. Louise, stop. Stop it, Louise. Too much. Let's go. For every problem, there is a solution that is simple, fast... And wrong. Sometimes it's painful to be so human. Hey! Hey, Robert! Want to take over here? Robert? Hello. Not here, not now, Doris. Your, uh...Whatever, ray-- ray needs you. His work just called, and apparently he's causing some kind of commotion-- something about explosives. I said you'd be right over. Jesus Christ! Uh, Doris... Forget it, you know? Get your sorry ass over there. Ray? Ray, it's Robert. Take it easy down there. Where are you? What the hell's going on here, guys? So... So? Sign says no smoking, ray. Forget that. Merry never came home last night. She, uh... She got rid of the baby. She had it, uh... She had it scraped out. Where's merry now? She's at her mother's. Ray, why don't you get the hell out of there before someone gets hurt, you crazy son of a bitch? Would you get the freak away? I'm going to light this fuse, and we'll all to go to hell on a flaming kazoo, all right? Kiely? Kiely, you all right down there? Guy's gone nuts! Uh, yeah, we're fine down here. He's just a little upset. Just give US some space. Sure. It's your ass. Watch yourself. Hey, daddy! What are you doing here? Surprise. What'd you do to your hand there? Oh, nothing much. Just fell. Don't worry. It's stopped bleeding. It sure is muggy out, huh? Daddy, let's go somewhere special. Let's go swimming. No, no, no. I don't have time. You shouldn't be here, Adele. Why not? Well, you're not supposed to be here until next Saturday. You get the wrong idea about things sometimes. I mean, a person can. When things start to go zip-zip-zip, it's hard to know which direction they're going. That's when it's better to slow down, get off, stand aside, take a look, and then decide. Decide what? Well, you decide whether or not you want things to go zip. What things? I did not ask you to ask your mother about living here. I feel that something's being asked of me that I cannot give. It's been almost seven years since I lived with you and your mother, and seven years is a long time. Nothing is expected of you, daddy. Oh, but it seems to be coming down to that. Daddy... Adele, I think it's best if we skip a few Saturdays, don't see each other for a while, at least until the emotions blow over. Whose emotions? And where are they supposed to blow to? Are you listening to me? So... What do you want me to tell you mother and your sisters? That's enough, ray! That's enough, okay? Okay, it's okay. Just give me the lighter. It's okay. All right. Now, you're going to walk out of here like nothing happened, all right? I promise I'm going to take care of it... And then you're going to buy me a beer. [ Laughing ] Okay? Can you lend me 10 bucks? I can think of a much better thing to do with a box of fireworks than to blow up your sorry ass. You take your time. [ Cat call ] ♪ I've got a lot of the blues ♪ ♪ I want to thank you for my re-education ♪♪ I need to talk to Adele. Hi. Hi. Isn't Adele with you? No. Did you call Louise? Yes. Louise said she went to her dad's. She must have meant Humphrey. I take it he hasn't called. Son of a bitch. Listen, I'll go get her. I need to talk to her anyway. About what? Doing the right thing. Robert! I know you're in there, goddammit, so open the door! What the hell do you want? Has Adele been here? Yeah. She all right? She had a bandage on her hand. A bandage? Yeah. Didn't she come home? No. She came to you. So what are you saying? You can't find her, so it's my fault? That what you're saying, it's my fault? ♪ Jada, Jada Jada, Jada, jing, jing, jing ♪ ♪ Jada, Jada Jada, Jada, jing, jing, jing ♪ ♪ Jada-- ♪ They're probably wondering what you're doing here this time of night. Sure took you a while. So I got a call from Doris. You are in deep, deep shit. It was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Isn't that what you said? There's always a price to pay. You're supposed to hurt the person who hurts you. I know who the shit is. I'm a great teacher, aren't I? But wrecking your shit would be like wrecking mine and mom's shit, because we share the same shit and things. That's encouraging. No, no, the sharing part, present tense. You know, like a family might? Or a pod. If you are of the whale persuasion. Except whales are monogamous. Actually, you know, that's not entirely true. In fact, mammals in general are not monogamous by nature, just by choice. I made a bad choice the other night, Adele. I guess I was feeling sorry for myself. My father says when things go zip, and you don't know what direction they're going in, it's better to get off. He said that? Better to get off. Well, you know, there's some trick to that, getting off. I never knew how to do it. No. You just embarrass people. Yeah. All right, you win. You do not deserve the horribleness that is me. I belong in a zoo... But I do know one thing. [ Alarm sounding ] Robert, no! We're not supposed to be here. Let's go. Maybe you'd like to know what I know. What? Let's go, please! Please? I know that I'm not your father, Adele... But you are the closest thing to a daughter that I will ever have. I want you to know that no matter what, no matter how far away from me you swim, I'm always going to keep you in my radar. Finally! Hey, mommy. My goodness, what have you done to yourself? I just...Got lost. Robert saved me from the wild animals. Good. Is that all you're going to say? What do you want me to say? Thank you would be good. What happened to you? 'Night, slobert. Maybe we should take her to the hospital. No, no. Where's my purse? It's sore. Hurts a little bit. Okay, I know what to do here. I have lots of experience. Well, at least it's clean now, but I don't know... These are the bandages they'd use at the hospital. They wouldn't do stitches for something like that. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ladies, you're going to want to check this out. Now what? Shh. No! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Eric, get the hell out of here! Go home! Don't come back! Hey, Adele! How do you like the show? Adele wouldn't tell me how she hurt her hand. I think she was trying to protect you. All right, joycie. Good for you. I actually thought you loved me. I do love you, beauty. You don't act like it... But if you did love me, what do you love most about me? Your compassion... Your ability to forgive. So the way I think now is that happiness is not getting what you want, but being grateful for what you've already got...
