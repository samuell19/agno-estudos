It feels exactly like we were at the hideout. We ARE at the hideout. I mean, here, at this table. This precise spot. Exactly the same places as the table we had in the hideout. How can you tell? From the window behind Pierrot. Theres no window behind me. No, the window that WAS behind you at the hideout. Didn't you notice? And we always sat like today, in the same places. Max – next to me, by the hearth 'cause he was always cold and got up to poke the fire. Joe there – at the end of the table, becase he couldn't stand sitting beside anyone during card games. Jean – opposite me, by the door because he... he always came last and he used to go piss every half hour. And Pierrot, there, because that was the only seat left. And I sat here, facing that window that I often looked through. I dont know why... Maybe, to see if someone was coming. M'selle, do you know how long this cafeteria's been open? No, I’ve only been working here, 2 days. 2 days ?! But, you carry the beers with such grace ! Just by the way it looks, I'd say ... 30 years ? What? 30 years ? Impossible. Last time we came here was in '78. that'd make it ... 28 years. You knew this spot before it was a cafeteria? - Yes. How was it? It was green It was a huge forest. No one around. Very easy to get lost. There were boars, huge boars, walking around, just like that! Enormous ! On this very spot there was a hideout... I-I mean, a hut. Did you come often? No, not often. But when we came we'd stay a long time. Too bad. Surely a forest is better than a cafeteria or a parking lot. Sometimes it seems things are becoming less and less beautiful. It moves me, to see people of your age together, like this. When I was little, heaps of old folks lived at our house. My parents were a host family for the old. As many as 15 at a time. the livingroom, my room... Everywhere! I thought my parents took them in for love of humanity. Turns out they got 500 Francs for each old person. That disappointed me a bit. The hardest part was they often died. At least one a month. Once, we lost 3 in 1 day. In August. I was always worried, because... I couldn't tell the difference when they were asleep or dead. It's not always obvious... You know what I mean. Pretty weird waitress, huh? We gotta find a new hideout. Why do you wanna find a new one? You need a hideout to hide out. Do YOU need to hide out? Well no! Anybody here need to hide out? No... - So ?!! Take it easy, Joe! Why are you so worked up? It's Jean talking nonsense! I'm not talking nonsense! You talk about a hideout like it was easy, like it had no meaning. Like our hideout is the same as any other hideout. You’re delirious! I never said such crap! I'm dying for a hideout! I'd give everything to have one. Damn... a pretty little hut, surrounded by wooded paths. I'd know what to do there! I miss chlorophyll ! Whenever we come here; -- that was my vacation, -- my paid holidays. It's 25 years, I haven't seen the countryside. I go to Castorama Hardware's garden center to see some greenery. What I miss most is fresh air. I’m suffocating! Suffocating! I like to get up early, with the light... take a piss outside, against a tree. Feel a fresh breeze about my glans. Damn!.. To piss against a tree... and hug it afterwards!.. When you phoned, before I knew it was about Pierrot. I thought, "that's it! We're back in business!". My heart raced... Like the old days,.. ..when a mere phone call would set my heart racing. What is it you want? Wanna do another break-in? No, I just said I miss nature. So take a holiday! How do I do that? Think I a get Government Stipend for my contribution to society? You guys wanna do a break-in? Stop talking about heists! Stop it! We'll end up getting caught. Caught for what? You kidding? 5 old geezers drinking beer in some godforsaken cafeteria. What's suspicious about that? You wanna pull another heist? No, I said, you guys want to. You been talking for a while about nature, boars, woods... You're looking depressed, guys. I'd like to pull another heist. What are you saying? I said, I'd like to pull another heist. Well, what ?!... I don't have anything better to do. You guys got anything better? I was gonna pick up my granddaughter at school and take her to the racetrack at Vincennes. I got poker tonight. Seems there's these two suckers... I'm supposed to be convalescing. You, Emile? I got nothing better to do. Whaddaya say guys, wanna pull another job? This can't be! Wanna pull a heist ? 'Cause tonight I can't play poker! Fine, what'll we knock over? You know the Crédit du Nord on National Route 17 ? No, we hit that bank 3 times! Precisely, we know it well. When was the last time? In '82, I had a BMW convertible. Aah, bella macchina! Well, why not? There are fields around it, and a forest big enough to hide in. After 25 years, they’ll be surprised to see us again. You sure it's here? - Well yeah! Nationale 17. This is, 17? - Yeah! Shit, we got no fucking luck. Fuck the world's disappearing! No more hideouts, no more banks... what's left then? Those places crop up overight. Can you heist a McDonalds? Anything can be heisted. Alright, lets go! - Yeah! Wait, who's the wheel man? - Pierrot. Why Pierrot? I wanna rob McDonalds too! You always drove the getaway car. And you're wearing pyjamas. Have you looked at your duds? Anyway, I cant drive, I cant see fuck all. We’ll smash into a wall. OK, Jean, you stay in the car. That's crap! Why me, why not Joe? Why do you get to decide? Nobody made you boss! Who's for Jean staying in the car? Alright? -Alright. Shall we go? Wait... What do we do for heaters? What heaters? Whaddya mean "What heaters"? We got no rods. What, you don't have guns?! How were you gonna finish me off at the hideout? Joe had an idea. We just put our hands in our pockets to create the illusion! Who'll keep his hand in his pocket? Emile and me! Why not me? Joe you know what happens if you have a gun! Why, what happens? You shoot, you can't help yourself. It's not a gun, it's my hand! Even so! You're liable to shoot with your hand! But, I learned to control myself. Who's for Joe not carrying a gun? Alright! Let's go! What the hell you doing, Jean? What? You're supposed to stay in the car! Oh yeah right. What's going on? He just fell. You alright, Pierrot? Fine, fine. What happened to you? – I fell, that's all. Come on, lets go back! Your nose is bleeding, Pierrot. Are you sick ? Yes. Is it serious? Yes. Want us to take you back to hospital? No! What do you want us to do? Drive on, we'll see... - Shall I start'er up? - Sure go head! epilogue epilogue Don't we know each other? When you mugged your boss did you hit him with the gun? I whacked him from behind. Can I see it? What? The piece. Umm, yeah. I’ll show it to you, but turn around. - Why? Because I’m asking you. You gonna whack me on the skull? No way! OK! There! We've met... THE EVENING BEFORE LAST The evening before last, the young man was being chased by the police So he asked the young woman at the toll-booth to hold his weapon, then asked her to raise the barrier but the young woman answered: "I cant, it's 1 euro .20" The young man who had no loose change asked the young woman to give back his gun. He asked her to raise the barrier. He thanked her, as he gave her back his weapon, for fear of being caught with it. So we know each other. We've run across each other. So... So, stick ‘em up! Hands up! The till. What? The till! What's this ?! That's all. The boss took the rest to the bank Always does that after his shift. How about that ?! See ya later. Hey! This is all crap ! - Why? We ought to split it! I took a risk too. You come with nothing not even daring to rob me... and now you're gonna split with the cash and the gun ? Alright. Here's the money. I keep the piece. OK? -Alright. -Voilà. Actually, no ! I prefer the gun. Why? A gun's better. But it's my gun! Yeah, but you gave it to me. OK... Here's the piece... Hand me the cash! No. -Look, you can't... -What are you gonna do ? Can I come with you? But I'm not going anywhere. Doesn't matter... You wanna come with me ?! Yeah, I wanna. (Lower that!)
