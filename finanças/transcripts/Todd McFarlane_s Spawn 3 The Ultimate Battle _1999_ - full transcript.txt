No! Don't let the demons take you. Don't let the demons take you. Don't let the demons take you. Don't let the demons take you. "Within the souls of every Hellspawn..." "a battle is waged." "What scraps of humanity can they hold on to?" "What master will they serve?" "Every Hellspawn, all the way back to the primordial past..." "has lost their struggle with the darkness." "Each one sank into the pit..." "to sit at the right hand of Malebolgia..." "to wait for the final battle against the light." Choose, Hellspawn. What master do you serve? I serve no master! He came to you again, didn't he? The Black Knight will keep coming to you... tormenting you, until you choose. How do you know my dreams? Within you are the remnants of other Hellspawns from the past. You and I are connected across the millennia. You're nothing like me. You can't know what I feel. It's time you heard the cold, hard truth. I'm nearly out of time... and you are the only hope I have to finish my journey. Look, old man, I don't know how you know about the dreams I have. Maybe I yelled out. But that's all it was... a bad dream. Humans dream, not dead men who have sold their souls. - Get away from me! - Violence is all you know. You thrive on it, but it only sends more souls to your master. It makes him stronger. I have no master. Yes, you do. Malebolgia. - And he chose the right man. - Look at me. I'm not a man anymore. You were a man once. You can be a man again. The one you call Malebolgia... he can't be real. He is real, and you know it! What do you want from me? I want you to remove that scarlet shroud. A Hellspawn can be free of the curse. How can you know that? Because I am free. Where we going first? What about that club we used to go to on 42nd? Hey, college boy. You've been gone too long. - We don't go there anymore. - Yeah. In fact, you don't ask where we go. We go where I drive. Yeah, we go where he drives. There's nothing like a Saturday night. Joey, you can have a real woman tonight... not that college peach fuzz. Jesus! Come on, Frankie. You know I'm going out with Gina. "You know I'm going out with Gina." Hey, Petey, you were always the smartest guy in school. You know how it works here. How come you didn't... go to college? I had some good business opportunities. I know a sweet setup when I see it. That's what separates me from the rest of the dumb fucks... - in this neighborhood. - I hear that. What are we doing at Orvetti's? He's closing up. Just for old times' sake. Like when we was kids cruising the old neighborhood. Remember how Mr. O used to slip us candy on the sly... so his old lady wouldn't see? - Remember that, Petey? - Yeah. He was cool. Last of the guys from the old country. When my Mom got sick, and after when she was gone... he used to bring groceries to the apartment. That's right. Come on. Let's go in, see what's up with him. Mr. Orvetti, you closing up? Hey, I'm never closed for you boys. You should come down to the neighborhood more. You got any of that cannoli you used to give my pops? - Hey, Mr. O! - Forget about it! I got cannoli, I got pistachios, I got everything. Here, mangia, mangia. Eat, eat, eat. Look at you kids. Me, I see men in my store tonight... not little boys anymore. Hey, Mr. O, it's Joey. Jesus! Why the fuck did you do that? Just doing a favor for the guy. That's all. Holy shit! That's the way it's done, Frankie. Quick and easy. It gets a little messy sometimes, but, hey, forget about it. What's done is done. Jesus, Petey, what'd you do to my cannoli? There's fuckin' brains in it now! How am I supposed to eat this shit? I been around a little longer than you, Frankie... so listen to me a little bit. If you want to get noticed, you got to do favors. I don't want any part of this, man. If the cops ask me, I'm going to tell them what you did. Shut up, Joey. I'm not going to prison for this, Petey, you dumb fuck! Stand still. I got my eye on you. You killed him for nothing! Shit, Bobby, you got to tell me what's happening here. Hey, Frankie, listen, don't worry. All right? It's nothing. Get in the fucking car. Let's just go. Come on. Okay, what's done is done. He's dead. We just got to keep it together, keep it cool. - I'm going to get sick. - Lighten up, man. Have a little toke. Relax a little, okay. Let me out of here. I can't breathe, man. Shut up! Just shut up, all of you. I got to work things out. I'm going to puke! Be a man. There's an alley up ahead. You made a big mistake, Frankie, bringing him. I ain't going to lie to you, Frankie. I don't think Joey is going to make it home tonight. He's just sick, Petey. I'll take care of him. He's not from the streets. He didn't get into the Army like us. You don't understand. I'm saying... he's not going to make it home. At all. So you do it, Frankie. You take care of him right now. Come on. Move. Let's go. Come on. Move. Let's go! What's going on, Frankie? What's going on? Talk to me. Come on, man. Don't joke around. Frankie, what are you doing? I'm your best friend. Put the gun away, man. - You think he'll do it? - If Frankie's smart. I don't want to stay out all night burying bodies. I thought we were buddies, Frankie. What are you doing? Don't shoot me, man. I'm begging you! I don't want to die! Shut up, Joey! It's your fault. You brought this on yourself. If you hadn't opened your mouth to Petey... Frank, it's me, Joey. Why are you doing this, man? Come on. - You know I wouldn't give you up. - Shut up! What's happening, old man? The portal is opening... preparing to receive a soul. Strange. - It feels... - Familiar? Yes. You yourself came through. You just don't remember. I don't want to look at your face! What's done is done, Joey. Why don't you kill your good buddy somewhere else? Jesus Christ! I'm sick of seeing you punks in my alley. What are you, some kind of freak? Get the fuck out of here... You're just taking up space, breathing my air. This boy wants to be a killer, like you. It looks like you're going to show him how. I want you gone. Why are you doing this, kid? You don't owe them anything. You think I want to shoot him? Joey fucked up. I brought him into this, and now they think I'm a rat too. They made me. This isn't even my fucking gun. Get out! You think you control what goes on here? You're damn right. You have a lot to learn, Hellspawn. It's taking too long. Maybe Frankie didn't have the guts. - Then they're both dead. - Yeah, they're both dead. Shit! What the hell's going on? Am I dead? Am I dreaming? What? No. There's got to be a way. Am I being punished? Is that it? I can't believe this! What's happened? There's no way out for you, Frankie. The bullet waits. Which side are you on? I'm on my side! Mister, in my neighborhood... you take care of business or business takes care of you. I don't have to choose shit! Why don't you two faggots go fuck off! Who is the real executioner here? Anyone who would murder his best friend... isn't worth keeping alive. You think he's the only one who has sacrificed a friend? You had choices about killing too. You're no better than him. I was a soldier, stuck in a lot of dirty little wars. I took orders. This kid's just taking orders too. His life depends on it. You remember your buddy, don't you? The friend you sacrificed in the jungle? What did you say? You let him die at the hands of the enemy... while you survived. I don't want you in my head, old man. Do you remember your friend Sykes? Sykes. You could have saved him. Your position, man. I want to know your unit's position. Don't tell him anything, Al. How about you, motherfucker? Would you like to live? Don't tell them anything... Sykes! They're coming, man. It took hours before your friend's body stopped moving. There was the smell of his blood... the sound of the machete hacking through bone... his moaning, the little whimpers before he died. Do you remember those sounds? Do you remember the blood, how thick? Your feet were sliding on it. When it was your turn... what was the only thing you could think of? Do you remember what that was? The one thing you would give anything for? You'd better kill me. Do you remember? Secure the area! Cut our men off that pole! Now! Major Forsberg, sir, we didn't tell them anything, sir. Jesus. All the map coordinates we gave you were bogus... in case you were captured. Do you remember what you did... even after you were rescued? They're just... women and children, Al. Don't give in to the demons. I can guide you out of here. Listen to me, Al. Look at me. Don't let the demons take you. You hear me, soldier? Don't let the demons take you. And the way you felt. You remember that, don't you? Don't you? Yes! Yes! It felt good. I'm glad I killed the little prick. I scattered his brains all over the jungle. When you pulled that trigger... you made the eyes of Hell turn toward you that day. You made Hell take notice. You're lying! You don't know a damn thing about me! You gave Hell a new player. That moment was the beginning. You made them look at you, crave you. Spawn was born on that day. That's why they turned me into a monster? They put the right face on you, Hellspawn. You're just like Frankie here. When you were still human you gave up your humanity. Hey, Gramps. This Night of the Living Dead stuff is really freaking me out. I didn't choose Hell. What the fuck am I doing... talking to a bum about Hell? There ain't no Hell. I got to get out of here. You get me out of this goddamn fog. No. It's done. Time to choose. The trigger has already been pulled. The target chosen. Why are you doing this, Frankie? Don't shoot, Petey. What's it going to be, Frankie? You did the right thing, Frankie. Tonight you made your bones. If you had killed them... Malebolgia would just have had more soldiers. Why does Malebolgia play these little games? He didn't make Frankie pull that trigger. Frankie made the choice to be a killer, just like you did. Hell can't make you choose. They don't have that power. You justified it. I'm not buying into your little drama, old man. Why? Because you refuse to trust me. Then find someone else. There must have been someone you believed in... some time in your life. Don't give in to the demons. Forsberg. I trusted him. He was a rock. Not anymore. Don't let the demons take you. Don't let the demons take you. Major Forsberg, how have you been? I hope my friends have been treating you well. I have come for you. "How does one find humanity in an alley?" "How does one regain one's soul..." "in an abandoned church?" "For this newest Hellspawn..." "this alley is a way station..." "his special purgatory." In sickness and in health... until death do you part. "He lurks here in the shadows..." "amid this human debris, waiting..." "just inside the portal from Hell." "But this is not his domain." "His domain is that burned skin..." "his shell of necroplasm..." "and the scarlet shroud..." "which hovers around him..." "protecting him and possessing him..." "at the same time." I'm sorry I made you stay here again, honey... Where is the old man? Why isn't he here? I don't know. He's a ghost. Like you. He just appears. Al, what's happening to your face? He's laughing at me. It's okay, man, it's okay. Look, it's just the church bells, man. Come on. It's Sunday morning. Stop it! Leave me alone! I am still alive. Did you think you could strike a deal with Malebolgia... and then renege? This is a graveyard. I can feel the death. Yes. Look around you. These artifacts are all that remain from Hellspawns of the past. They were cursed, like you. This is their shrine... a reminder of what may be your fate. Maybe you're not a crazy old bum. What do they call you? I have had many names... and this time they call me Cogliostro. How long have you been hiding here? Hiding? I've been here for many years. You see, I'm the night curator of antiquities. This is how I have kept these relics safe... while I waited for you. Waited? In every age a Hellspawn is sent. I tried to guide them, as I've tried to guide you... but they are lost souls. I'm not them. This is your tomb. What deal did you strike with him? It was the time of knighthood, the time of the mist. "After the endless battles and the slaughter of innocents..." "it was I who was sent by Malebolgia..." "to collect the souls..." "and ride with them in the air at night..." "the ride of the dead." "But never to die." "There was no honor in that, not for a knight." "My honor had been taken from me." "I turned away from killing." "The black arts drew me." "I struggled with the evil inside..." "and used sorcery to free myself." "In that time, I was known as Merlin." If you are the Black Knight, then I want answers. Your flesh rebels against you. The shroud attacks you. You wallow in self-pity. You're lost. I don't want to hear any more talk, old man! You claim to be some kind of wizard. Show me what this goddamn shroud is good for. - No. - You will, old man. This is not the alley, Hellspawn! I make the rules in this place! You are in my domain! They may have taken your honor, but they stole my life. I came back for Wanda... but she sees me as a monster. Do you wish to find the answers? What are you prepared to do? I am going to get my life back. If you won't help me, I'll find the answers somewhere else. One of your officers found a report on a cop killed in the alleys. "Jason, you're a busy man." "Why are you spending your time..." "reading our New York City police reports?" Chief Banks, if I didn't feel you served a purpose for me... I wouldn't have gotten you nominated for police commissioner... and we wouldn't be having this conversation, would we? Mr. Wynn, I didn't mean to imply that... The report was written by an officer named Max Williams. "Twitch. Smart cop. Thorough." His partner is Sam Burke, a meat-and-potatoes guy. Your "smart cop" describes the shooting death... of one of your best officers, killed in the alleys. "The dying man's last words on Earth were 'red cloak.'" Find the man in the red cloak. Don't move in on him until you call me. "Consider it done." Damn thing's no good. Sights are off or something. Yes, sir. Worthless piece of shit. - It's jammed. - Fortunately. I can usually shoot the dick off a squirrel from here. Look at this junk, stupid gun. Your lack of aim is surely the gun's fault, sir. "Lack of aim"? What, Twitch, you think you can do better? You know, Twitch, you've really lost your sense of humor. You're too serious. You got to learn to lighten up a little. Let's just see now. Lucky son of a bitch. Give me that gun. Burke. I thought they weren't going to let you back on the range... after that "incident" last week. Hey, I been cleared of that one. It was the guy's fault. He should've ducked. You're at a disadvantage, Burke. Your gut keeps you too far from the target. Hey, Twitch, I think the chief just cracked a joke. All right. This is your report on one of ours... that was killed in the alleys? We closed that case. It was our collar. That cop was killed by a crazy priest. Before he died, that cop said there were two of them. That leads me to believe that maybe the priest had a playmate. He also said something about a red cloak. I remember. That's a detail I shouldn't have missed, Chief. Get me a perp. I don't care if you got to eat, breathe and sleep those alleys... and I don't care how much shit you step in. You should feel right at home there, Burke. Check it out. "You're missing the point, Lisa." "I don't want you to have fun in New York." "I want you to have a lonely, exhausting trip..." "which indicates to me you're writing a story..." "that will spill a lot of ink." Let's cut the bullshit. If I wasn't the best, you wouldn't have sent me. "You got a thing for these psychos, Lisa." "You always manage to get close to them." Yeah, well, my job is to hunt them down. They all give off the same scent. "What scent is that?" Evil. - "Hey, Lisa." - Yeah? "You're spooky. Now tell me what you have." This guy wears a red cloak. Hey, he's no joke. He murders people. I'm going to find him... and deliver to you his head on a platter. Like dolls' eyes. Fourth time with this zombie, we don't have shit. The guy has no prints, no name. As soon as he starts in about "the dead guy's back," I'm gone. I can't do a fifth dance with this twisted sister. Nice digs. Good thing you're getting some R&R, big guy. A wallflower? You see this? This is a forensic report that says that your DNA... matches the cells found underneath the nails of a dead bum. We also have witnesses that say you killed... this less fortunate fellow. We found this nearby. He's dead. I saw him burnt to a crisp. - But he's back. - That's it. I'm gone. Come on, Twitch. Who's back from the dead? He looked at me with those green eyes. That cloak, it reached out and touched me like it was alive. Did you say "cloak"? He's going to drag me back to Hell. Tell me, who's come from Hell? Simmons. Al Simmons. What the hell are you doing? Just checking some details, sir. How's the chili dog? Kind of light on the onions. That may signal a slight improvement in air quality. Yeah. What a comedian. I'm going to grab a soda. You came in looking for me. Why? Shall we have a seat? You wrote some articles for The Washington Post... about a soldier named Al Simmons. That's old news, Detective. Why the interest? I was just wondering if you could offer me anything that was too... sensitive to put in print. - Like? - You tell me. Member of a special ops group. Saved the president a few years back. But you already knew all that before you came in the door. I'm like you. I do my homework. You know what, Twitch? I like you. You're a good cop and I'm a good reporter... and I know a fluff job when I hear it. So let's cut the bullshit. You tell me something, I'll tell you something. Ladies first. I wasn't allowed to print the fact that Al Simmons... was burned alive on a mission that the NSC says didn't happen. Your turn. I'm working the alley murders. Looking for a guy with a red cloak. I have a perp down at Bellevue... that says he got a good look at this guy in the alley. Says he has a burned face. Now you tell me, Al Simmons was burned alive. Coincidences do happen. I don't believe in coincidences. Thank you for your time, Ms. Wu. I see the way you look when you talk about Al. You really loved him. He was my husband. No. I mean, he was the one. Is this going to show up in the paper? This is just you and me. What you said before, about Al? You're right. He was that one. Just hearing his voice excited me. When he touched me... After he died, I ached for him. For months I'd sleep with his shirt or his robe. Anything that smelled like him. Mommy, where are you? Mom? Mommy! Mommy's in here, sweet girl. There you are. You're a pretty lady. I remember you. I've never seen her take to someone so quickly. You have a way with her. Is she Al's child? No. Al couldn't give us a child. What's happening with the NSC and Terry? He lost his job. Come on, Cyan. I'm glad he's not there. - Up, Mommy. - We're a lot better off now. Jason Wynn will topple off the mountain. It is just a matter of time, Wanda. We almost lost everything... and I still can't get Terry to talk about it. He stays away for days at a time. Maybe he's protecting you. Sometimes the truth is brutal. It's driving us apart. Something's wrong. But he won't let me inside. Maybe you haven't grieved Al's death. Do you sometimes feel that he's still with you? You've seen him, haven't you? The creature. Twice. I've seen what he's capable of, and I haven't told anyone. You know who it is, don't you? He spoke my name. There was something in his voice. I think you should go now. If you can hear me, Al, I know you're with me. I feel it. Wanda. I'm hungry, Mama. I ask you to step out where I can see you... very respectfully. I warned the last cop not to come into my alley. Are you threatening me? - What would you do about it? - I'd shoot you between the eyes. Did you kill him? The police officer? You've got some hard bark on you for a little guy. No, I didn't kill him. Murders have occurred in this alley. One victim was a homeless man. We have a suspect who wears a skull face... a ritual of some kind. Chapel. I left him alive for you. This man you call Chapel... We have him locked away. He's quite completely insane. So naturally, when he described you we didn't believe it. You believed it. You're here. He claims you're Al Simmons... a soldier who was burned alive five years ago. What do you think? I think you somehow survived a government cover-up. You're closer than you think. Can you get me closer? You want to be a knight in shining armor? Go play cops and robbers. Forget all about this. I wouldn't want to see your body dumped in my alley. Confirm Chapel's involvement. Chapel was just a puppet. The NSC was pulling the strings. Who's the puppet master? What difference does it make? Do you think you can stop them, little man? I can do my best. You were a soldier once, a hero to your country. What happened to your code of honor? When you play with matches... it burned. Don't come down to these alleys again. One of your officers has accessed some of my files, Chief Banks. - Why? - "I don't know anything about it." The only guy here capable of doing that would be Twitch... Officer Williams. "You asked about him before." "He's working on the killings in the alley." Find out what he knows. And after I get the information from Officer Williams? I understand that New York's finest... who are killed in the line of duty... are given quite a hero's burial. "Just tell me where to send the flowers, Chief Banks." I spoke with a red-cloaked man here in this place. I believe he's still somewhere in these alleys. I'm going to take a look around. Check it out. This goes all the way up to a high official in the NSC. And who would this official be? The only man who could make decisions at this level... is Jason Wynn. My instinct is that the suspect we have down at Bellevue... is one of his assassins. That's quite a story, Twitch. I mean, sounds like you have a very solid lead. You've done well, Officer. The department is proud of you. Thank you, sir. Officer down! Get a goddamn ambulance down here! Jesus, he's bleeding hard from his head! Officer down! Do you hear me, goddamn it! Twitch is down! Twitch, can you hear me? This is Sam. Listen to me. Nobody dies tonight. You hear me? You're not going to die in this shithole alley. Hey, Burke. I saw the guy with the red cloak. He came out of nowhere, shot your partner. I chased him, but he just vanished. Look what he did to Twitch. Sweet Jesus. I'm going to kill that fucker for what he did to my partner! Wait for backup! Burke! You hear that, you piece of shit? I'll fucking kill you! Glad you guys could make it. But you're a little late. The son of a bitch is gone. I knew you would come. They're swarming through the alleys. I can't go back till they're gone. There's always sanctuary for you here. Why do they hunt you? What have you done? They think I killed a cop. I can't hide from them anymore. You have to stop the senseless killings. The people I kill deserve to die! You project your evil onto others and then kill them... thinking you've destroyed that evil. You're no different from the other Hellspawns... and they're all dead. It is all foretold here in the Book of Knowledge. That's just a musty old book. It means nothing to me. There's only a single book like this one... written a long time ago, in the time of the mist. It can help you break the curse and defy Malebolgia. He made me a prisoner inside this shroud. I escaped the shroud. You can do the same and be free. It fights against me. I can't control it. Yes, you can. To be master of the shroud, you must be master of your heart. My heart is dead. That's what Malebolgia wants you to believe. Yes, he did choose a man whose heart was dark... but now, inside you, there is some good. Malebolgia is the mind killer... and he will seep in like a sickness, if you let him. The shroud controls your flesh... but there is a way to keep it... from controlling your mind and heart. How do I fight against an enemy I can't see... that I know nothing about? A part of you is the enemy. You have to bury the man you once were... because he's damned. Become a new man, a better man. Only then will the shroud serve you. Don't preach to me! I need to know. Can this thing give me my body back? It can give you any form you choose. So you'll have your face back. What then? I want to see my wife as I used to be. A man. I never had the chance to tell her good-bye. That's all I ask. There is a cost. I don't give a damn! I've already lost everything. There's nothing more to lose. You will be vulnerable in your human form. In time, your skin will decay... and you will return to the form you are now. Are you strong enough for that? Whatever you do, there will be consequences. Show me, old man! Allow the shroud to envelop you. Here you go. Twitch. Hey, buddy. You're going to make it. I told them you're going to be okay. Back in business. I'm sorry. - Who are you? - It's me, Twitch. Sam Burke. I'm your partner. Of course. My partner. Cyan, child. Stay out of those chocolates... and get an apple like Granny told you to. All right, Granny. - I'll get it, Granny. - That's all right, child. I'll get it. Who could that be? Yes? Can I help you? I'm... I'm looking for Wanda Blake. And who is this that's asking? Just an old friend of hers back in town. Well, now, I know most of Wanda's friends. Hi, it's me, Cyan! I'm sorry to have bothered you. Would you like to come in and wait for her? No. - I've made a mistake. - Please don't go. At least not yet, Al. Granny? What? You think I still wouldn't know you? I visit your grave every Sunday... to talk to you and pray for you. I prayed that you'd answer me in some way. I could use a few prayers. Just last night I had a dream... that you were in a darkened church, looking for the Lord. You always did see more than the others. It is you. You have come from Heaven, haven't you? - An angel to watch over us. - Granny... I wish I was the person you want me to be. - Here, kitty, kitty. - You've always had a good heart, Al. You just need to follow it. The Bible says... "If you see and hear with your heart... you'll be shown the mysteries of His kingdom." The afterlife is not what the good book says, Granny. Why don't you come inside? I was wrong to come. I wanted to see Wanda. - I was afraid. - What could you be afraid of? That I would never see her again. Nothing can keep you and Wanda apart. Not death, not anything. Just wait for her, watch over her. She'll join you in Heaven one day. You always had faith, Granny. You're the only one who knows I've come back. This is my granny. She can't see. She sees more than most. I think Wanda knows that you are still with her. Al? That's the sad man. How is our patient? You just join us? Feeling okay? I have a severe headache. What's your name? I'm Twitch. I mean, what is the name on your birth certificate? He knows his own name, Doc. Don't you, Twitch? Maximilian... Percival Williams. The bullet shattered on entering your skull... that's the good news. The bad news is that... we couldn't remove the largest fragment. It's in a real precarious spot, so... you'll have a little house guest for a while. Come on, Doc, stop holding our hands. Tell us what the damage is here. You see, he suffers from edema. Until the swelling in his brain goes down... we won't know the extent of the damage. - I'll check back later. - Yeah. You do that, Doc. Sir, you look like you've lost some weight. A little. You weren't around to get me do... Hey, partner! You remember me! It's hard, sir. My memory... it feels shattered... like a puzzle that fell to the floor. I'm searching for the pieces. They said if you ever did wake up, you'd be a veggie. We got a lot of work ahead of us. You just need a lot of rest. Help me, Sam. Don't let them put me away in some warehouse. I want to get this guy. We'll get him. "What should I do with you?" I shot the bastard point-blank, Wynn. "Not even the doctors have figured out how he pulled through." Your inability to do the job... has put you in a very difficult position, Chief Banks. We're both in a difficult position. This creature told Twitch about you. He'll eventually put the pieces back together. When he does, you be there. Here he comes. I'll be close by. I've been waiting for Wynn to step wrong. If this information is what you say it is... Wynn will go away. Then your problems will go away, Mr. Fitzgerald. Forget me. What about my family? My wife and little girl. Mr. Sullivan, I want assurance that they'll be safe. I can't assure that. What? There is a cancer, Mr. Fitzgerald. A cancer that has spread through the NSC all the way to the top. My job is to destroy the enemy within... whoever they are... wherever they hide. Judy, what's taking so long? I want the vice president on the phone now. "Sir, I... They said he's not available." What do you mean, he's not available? He and I have this phone call every day. "That's what they told me, sir. I'm sorry." "Thought you should know..." "I was strolling through Central Park today..." "and there were two men talking on a park bench." "Did you hear me?" Clearly. I was just thinking that a maggot like yourself... wouldn't have the balls to fuck with me like you are... if the two men on the bench were not a great threat to me. Something, I'm sure, is to your advantage. "One man was Terry Fitzgerald." And the other man? "Vice chairman of the NSC, Richard Sullivan." "The guy who's been circling over you like a vulture." I'll have to repay the favor some day. Hey, Wynn. You're a free agent now. With what you know, you just became... the most dangerous man on Earth. You got my message. - Where's Cyan? - She's at Granny's. - I told you to bring her. - She's safe there. I didn't like what I heard in your voice. Are you telling me you needed to keep her safe from me? I'm her daddy, remember? Lately you scare me, and you're scaring Cyan. Pack your bags. We'll pick up Cyan on the way. What's going on? You've been gone two days. You don't even tell me where you've been. By morning Jason Wynn will no longer be the director of the NSC. He'll be brought up on charges of treason. When he realizes I was the one who dropped the dime on him... he'll come after me. We can't stay here any longer, Wanda. We have to go. And start all over? No. There are laws in this country... Laws? Are you serious? You really believe being a lawyer is going to protect us? Wanda, listen to me. Wynn has people everywhere. We can't stay here any longer. This is my home. I won't be driven out. You're right, Wanda. I'm the one who's the target. Terry, wait. Where are you going? - It's better if you don't know. - Terry, please. Don't go. "It's a Chief Banks. He insists on talking to you." I don't know a Chief Banks. It's the New York Times. They'd like a statement about the allegations. I'm not here. Judy. Have my car pulled up in back. Where is he? He's out of the office. Hey, what do you think you're doing? - I'm sorry, Wanda. - I'm glad you came back. What is it? What's wrong? I don't know. For just a moment I thought I saw... I will always keep you safe. I love you, Wanda. I'm looking for a man. I wonder if you could help me. Hey, how about me, baby? He wears a red shroud. You're the only one beside him who ever called it a shroud. - Where is he? - Who is it that seeks the shroud? Jade. There's still a price... on your head, Hellspawn. You were the only Hellspawn to escape me. As you can see, I gave up my shroud. I live now as a human lives. I live in fear. Tell the new Hellspawn I'm coming for him. Terry? I know you're there. I have no place else to go. There is someone else who hunts you. She is a celestial warrior. What are you talking about? A bounty hunter sent by the celestial masters. She was the iron mistress of Genghis Khan. I'm not interested in a history lesson, old man. You should be... because he also sent souls to Malebolgia. Millions of them! He slaughtered innocent women and children. You look a little spooked. - She hunted me as well. - You feared a woman. These spawns long before you... they thought she was weak, too, because she was a woman. I tried to warn the others also. They didn't listen either. - That's the skull of Genghis Khan. - I'm not like him. Is there no blood on your hands, Hellspawn? Heaven has sent their bounty hunter. Now she wants your head. Then let her come. "When the full moon came..." "the Hellspawn stared at it for a long time..." "as if expecting to discover some truth..." "in its cold stillness." "Clarity, maybe." "A measure of peacefulness." "Things he hadn't known for a long time." "But the moon only brought into his world..." Get your fucking hands off me! More savageness. You see, this is business, Lakesha. If you're not working for me, I lose money. Why you turn tricks for those fuckin' Russians? I treated you like my queen. I'm not stupid. I see through you. You think those nice clothes and fancy college talk... makes you better than me. You're more whore than I am. You're nothing but a coward. Is this what you do? You kill people with these things? You're not a hero. You're a coward. Get out of my house. Wanda, I... I don't even know who you are anymore. So, Charles, what you want us to do with her, man? She just retired. Cut her up. Shit! Five-oh. See you around, Lakesha. Hey, lady, you okay? "Officers requesting medical assistance at alley west..." I remember this one. We busted her a couple of months ago. That you, Lakesha? I know who did this. It was Charles, wasn't it? Not for nothing, you don't have to let him beat on you like that. Come on, Lakesha. You want to make a statement this time? Lakesha, help us put his black ass in jail, where it belongs. You going to bring flowers to my grave? Just leave me alone. Announcing the arrival of Red Traveler 164... from Des Moines, Iowa, Gate 53. She's so innocent and fresh. The homecoming queen who came to New York to be a star. - Jesus, you know the drill. - Sure. Tricks are going to tear her in half. Where are you going, sweetheart? The subway. Hey. Beat it, or I'll cut you like a fish. You have to be careful, miss. This is New York. You just don't talk to sleazoids like him. I was hoping to get some directions. I'm really hungry, and I need a place to stay. - Hey, are you guys security? - Yeah, what's the problem? Listen, would you guys show this girl where the YWCA is? And here, buy her some dinner, will you? - Sure. - These guys will take care of you. Good luck, miss. If you need any help, just call me. You're really nice. And they told me that New Yorkers... might try to take advantage of a girl. You're a long way from the sticks. - What's your name? - Lily. Lily. Like in lily-white ass? The doctor filled me in. Told me he's not sure what the real damage is... until the swelling goes down. Hey, Twitch is fine. He'll be on the streets in no time. Hey, that's for me to decide, Detective. According to the doctor... your partner is experiencing some memory loss. That's bullshit. What he needs is rest, not visitors. How are you, Detective? You're probably getting tired of people asking you that. Thank you for coming, Chief. Detective Williams... I know this medal of bravery is not much... compared to what you've been through... and what you've sacrificed for this city... but please accept it as a token of our gratitude. You've done well, Officer. The department is proud of you. Well, I guess I'll be going. He needs his rest. You okay, Twitch? Move. Out of the way. Move! Jesus. Jason Wynn said he would call you. Yes, we spoke. He's very concerned about your officer. I'm going to handle his care personally. In a situation like this, epinephrine is very effective. Got to be careful. A large dose can cause the heart to beat so fast... it tears itself apart. Another shot? What is it? Something to help you sleep. You've had some restless nights, Officer. I've been having nightmares. Now, this is going to make your heart race a little at first... but that's normal. Wait. I don't want the shot. Hey, can't you give this man some peace? You wake him up in the middle of the night... to see if he's sleeping? Stop poking him all the time. He's not a damn pin cushion. This is Burke. Two? When? Didn't I tell you? Anything in the alleys, you call me first. No one touches a fucking thing until I get there. They found two more dead bodies in the alley. Leg breakers for a pimp downtown. Their throats ripped out. Near where you were popped. It's not enough the bastard shoots you. Now he's rubbing my face in it. I have to see it. Maybe I'll remember something. Hold on. Get your scrawny ass back in bed. You still got half a bullet in your brain. They're not going to just let you go. You have to sign something. Let them off the hook. I don't remember how to sign my name. That's fuckin' great. Okay, but when we get to the crime scene... let me do the talking. Something happened. What have you done? Wanda. All I wanted was to touch her again. - She saw you for what you are? - No. Terry is her husband. She thinks she slept with him. You come back from Hell to reclaim your wife... this woman who means everything to you... and you make love to her in the body of another man? - She never has to know. - You know. Where is your honor? Honor? What do you know about honor? I've read the inscription on your tomb. The Black Knight provided a feast of souls for Malebolgia. He killed for the pleasure of it. Yes. I killed women and children. I showed no mercy. I have had 800 years to change my heart... and still that's not enough to wash away what I've done. You think you can save me? If I can bring one Hellspawn back to humanity... I can rest. Win your points on someone else. I'm finished here. Let him take me back to Hell. I have nothing left to give except to you. Everything has been taken from me. Everything I have ever loved and cherished is dead... gone a long time ago... hundreds of years ago, lost in the past. Why do you go on? I want my honor back! Let Malebolgia take my soul. I can't die without my honor! You ever seen anything like this? It's a slaughterhouse. These two work for Charles. Maybe it's some mob thing. He took this turf from the Russians. No, this ain't mob. Hey, here comes Burke and Williams. What's everybody standing around for? Get these looky-loos out of here. Let's move it! - You got it, Detective. - You heard the man. Which way's the coroner going to go with this guy? Cause of the death... wild dogs. You don't believe that. In a logical world, that would be a reasonable call. They were both clawed, torn open. And there are fang marks on the scalp... the neck, shoulders and chest. No damn dog is this powerful. These guys were tossed around like rag dolls. - It's him. - Who is "him," Twitch? Beat it, will you? Get back there behind the tape with the other vultures. Where the hell are the forensic guys? I don't want to be out here all night. I'm a little surprised to see you back to work, Officer Williams. I heard you got hit pretty hard. Last time we spoke was in the cop bar, right? You were looking in the alleys for a guy in a red cape. If you play with matches, you can get burned. I heard he's the prime suspect in your shooting. Think he did this, Officer Williams? No statements until the autopsies are done, okay? Whatever you say, Sam. Were these guys killed here or just dumped? Can you at least throw me a bone? The first one was killed right here. He fired twice as they struggled. It's weird how their necks have been torn open... but there's no blood on the snow. - No blood on the bodies. - They were licked clean. Well, we don't really know that. So you don't spill a drop of ink about this. I don't want this headline showing up in my dog's mouth in the morning. What are those patterns in the snow around the body? I remember when I was a kid, in winter... we'd throw hot caramel on the snow. If hardened into a thin sheet, and we ate it like candy. That's what happened with the blood. When his aorta was severed... the blood that spattered froze when it hit the snow... and the killer scooped it up in handfuls. You remember stuff from when you were a kid... but you can't remember who shot you? The second one... Ran. Yeah, that's right. He only got about 30 feet. The attacker brought him down with such force that... the neck was severed... and the body drained of blood. But how would you know that, Detective? Hey, Twitch, I think you need to go warm up in the car. I'm worried about Twitch. How long has he been having these visions? What are you talking about, "visions"? The guy's the best cop on the force. Look, some freak in a red cape shot my partner... and he's probably responsible for these two heaps of ground rounds. I don't think he did this. You were right. The bodies were licked clean and drained of blood. Jesus, that's not even human. The killer wasn't human. Knock off the horror movie stuff, will you? Coroner cites tears on the chest and neck as claw marks... so deep they tore out one man's rib cage. Their blood was consumed where they were killed. Sounds like a big cat or a wolf. Maybe an animal got loose. We'll check the zoos. It's not a wolf, sir. I keep seeing him... in my mind. He had green eyes. I remember his claws. You didn't use to talk weird like this! You were the most straight-arrow cop I ever met. I don't blame you, sir... if you can't believe me. Go home, Twitch. You need to get a little rest. Yes, sir. Baby. Get away from him. Your kind has always disgusted me. I know who you are. I heard all about you. You're Jade. The other hunters, they told me to watch out for you. If you've gone too far and the boy's dead... I'm sanctioned to take you. He'll be okay. He looks like a sweet boy. But he's like the rest. He just wanted sex. Those two thugs in the alley... You led them there and then you ripped them open. I was hungry, and those pigs tried to turn me out like a cheap whore. Cops will think it's the Hellspawn. I want him to know I'm coming for him next. You have no license to hunt him. Only bounty hunters have that right. Yeah? Well, the masters were going to kick me out. But when they saw that you hadn't taken out the new Hellspawn... they offered me a deal... one last chance to prove myself. They didn't tell you that. You're a vicious little bitch. No wonder the masters threw you out. I didn't ask for this! I was raped and torn open by a Hellspawn. So don't preach to me. There is a way to track a Hellspawn. You act foolishly, he will finish you. I can take care of myself. If Heaven won't take me back... there's always Hell. A pretty girl like you shouldn't be out here in these mean streets. Come over here. I'm not going to bite you. Come on, baby. It's cold out here. I like it cold. I saw what was left of the two guys you were with. I want you to tell me who killed them. I think you were there. I was there. I heard the fucking little pigs squeal... when they were ripped open. Did you think you were going to be safe from me... hiding in this shithole church? No one's going to want you now. There's only one thing you're good for. I'm going to put your ass on the street, bitch. With a cut face, I probably won't get as much money for you. But you're mine! I own you! What are you? Tell me who you are. Do you sleep in here with these bones? How long have you been like this? Years. I don't like to think about that time. I wear these clothes so I can remember what I was... before I had the hunger. I must look so ugly. You're beautiful. I'm just like you. - They made me into a monster too. - Who? One like you, sent from Malebolgia. How do you know about me? I will take my revenge, Hellspawn... starting with you! You were sent by them? Heaven sent a girl to kill me? Is this the best they can do? What kind of heaven sends a creature like you? All the rules have changed, Hellspawn. Heaven wants to win. You're not like the others. This is your chance, bounty hunter. I'm a soldier, like you. We have our duty. Do you think you can take my head... the way you took the others? Come and take me. I want you to be strong when I come back for you. "For this Hellspawn..." "The creatures of the dark have nourished him." "Evil has strengthened him and restored his power." Over there. Hey, what about my money? - Wynn sent you. - He always sends someone. You knew that, Major. Did you come all this way to kill me, Al? My orders are... alive, if possible... dead, if necessary. I figured your chance of survival was better with me. We won't get as far as the river. - They're waiting for you. - I like a good fight. I found peace here in this temple. I help these people protect their ancient relics... from those who would take them. I don't give a shit about your trinkets. It's time to go home, Forsberg. He's getting too close. He's broken the circle. Wait! Don't shoot! What have you become? "Fragments of the Hellspawn's past..." "still haunt him." "He cannot escape his past life, even in death." "He must make the wrong things right again." You're finding out what kind of a man you were. Why do I even bother you, old man? Because some part of you seeks the truth. There was a man... Forsberg. He trusted me. I brought him back to Jason Wynn. - You betrayed him. - I had orders! You knew what Major Forsberg's fate would be at the hands of Wynn. - I didn't know. - You knew! Forsberg was thrown in a hole... beaten and left to die. He has the answers you seek, if he's still alive. I must finish the circle. The circle will protect me. If I finish the circle, the circle will protect me. I am prepared to die now. If I finish the circle... the circle will protect me. All I have left, I offer to you. I am prepared to die. Do you remember giving me this picture years ago? Before you betrayed me. You told me about what you had found... the war mask of Genghis Khan. You told me that whoever put his war mask on... would possess his powers... the powers given by Hell. I thought those missions in the jungles had made you crazy... but I'm a believer now. You don't believe in anything. I believe in power. There's a creature. It stormed the NSC building. Could have killed me. He was from Hell too. I'm already dead. You think you can take the power of the mask? It will destroy you. I've been by to see the wife and kid, Major. Some mementos. Have a look. Where did you get this? I know this toy. It belonged to my boy. My darling, your dress. I can smell your perfume. I miss you so much. I'm moved by your tears. I'll spare their lives, for now. - I will have the mask. - No. Give me a name or I'll kill them. Zhang Lao. They are innocent. They are innocent. Fight away! Yeah. Gen Soon, how are you? We have waited a long time for this day. With the Triad as your partner... you will be wealthy. I assume you got all of our cash out of Hong Kong. Yes. No one questions plane that says... "U.S. Air Force." 747s filled with 100 dollar bills, a beautiful sight. I know things have been rough for you... since Hong Kong went back to our Chinese friends. Yes. The Chinese pay attention. The British didn't. I've lost Hong Kong. Maybe not. What the Chinese want most is access to U.S. military technology. That has always been impossible. Not anymore. At every level of government... I've placed people who will be useful to me. Nothing is impossible. If you give China access... they'Il give you back Hong Kong. But there is something else I want. It's here, in Chinatown. You'll have my best men... wherever, whenever. A mask, a relic from the time of Khan. A man named Zhang Lao has it. I cannot help you with him. This Zhang Lao you speak of... he is no ordinary man. He is a witch. Gen Soon, you surprise me. A Harvard businessman. You sound as superstitious as the old Tong warlords. And look how far they fell. You have them chasing the dragon in your opium den downstairs. It has been a long time. I'm told that I still have a price on my head. Why do they bother with an old man like me? Your life has been spared this long. There is a reason for that. But you did not come here for yourself. Yes. The Hellspawn. I want you to spare his life. Hellspawn must be destroyed. The Army of Light demands that. I can save this one. You failed with all the others. That is why the bounty hunters kill them. I knew this Hellspawn that you speak of... when he was human. Hell has chosen well. Yeah. They always do. It's too late for him. The prophecy has already been fulfilled. The seed of a Hellspawn has been planted. I failed. There is a woman. She was the wife of the Hellspawn. She carries his seed. - "Wanda, it's me." - Where are you? I'm in Chinatown. "I've found Wynn." - "I need fo finish this." - Don't do this! It's the only way to keep you and Cyan safe. Terry. "Terry." "I love you, Wanda." Dad! It's okay, sweet girl. - Mama's here. - I want Daddy. - Where's my daddy? - It's okay, baby. - Dad! - No, honey. No. Mama's here. He had to go away on a trip. He'll be back. He's taking too long. Maybe Daddy got lost. Then I'll find him, baby. I'll find him. Jade. Your heart is troubled. You haven't killed the Hellspawn yet. Why? There is an art to the hunt. You want art? Lop off his head. You can hang it on the wall. But things have become so strange lately. Good and evil... they're like two shadows cast together on the same wall. Jade, maybe I should send another hunter. No. Truth is the only way of the warrior. If you falter, the Hellspawn will kill you. Come, come. You pay me money to look out for that man. He's here now. You come in and wait for him. Excuse me. Could you tell me if you've seen this man? Here he comes. Hey, what's this? Get away from them, freak. Leave him alone. He's just a bum. I'm going to kill that son of a bitch. You cut me! You thought you could kill me. Your buddy Simmons thought he could fuck with me. I burned him alive. But I'm not going to kill you. You don't die unless I let you. You don't go mad unless I allow it. Dope is going to be the only thing you think about... every moment of your life... till you look like one of these living corpses. They say the old man's a witch. I don't give a shit if he's the fucking Easter Bunny. I don't believe in that crap those low hunks talk about. We want the fucking mask, old man! You do not have the wisdom... to possess the war mask. It has many secrets. Have you seen him? Terry! Get off of him, bitch! I'm getting you out of here right now, Terry. I've prepared myself. I came to take you home, sir. Have you come to take me to Hell? - You're not going to die here. - You... You were the one... who got to Wynn... who made him fear something. - I should've killed him. - You called me "sir." You know me? Who are you? We both spent five years in hell... our families taken away. There is a war mask. It belonged to Genghis Khan. It possesses the powers of Hell. If Wynn finds it... I have to find it. Don't touch him! Leave him alone! Keep your hands off me! Terry! Ma'am, I'm Major Forsberg. I am a soldier. I've come to take you home. - My husband... - We have to go. He's been drugged. Wynn will kill him. We've got to hurry. Take them out of here. Wanda won't get far in this maze. My Chinese friends will have use for her when they find her. They'll sell her ass to the whorehouses in Thailand. This is a nice knife. There's a form of torture I'd like to introduce you to. I cut you from here to here... and slowly pull out your intestines. It's you! Time to die, Wynn. Wanda, stay down! Wanda... Get out of here! That thing looked like you, Terry. You were sent to kill me. Why did you save my life? You're not like the other Hellspawns. There is something good inside you. It's okay. "The Hellspawn stands closer fo his destiny." "He lies caught between two forces..." "Heaven and Hell." "A prisoner in a skin that is not his own." "Wanting fo break free..." "and smash through fo a new life." "He fights against the enemy within." "But he will soon Iearn..." "that the implacable enemy of Hell..." "is Heaven." "And the enemy will keep coming." Two more bounty hunters in the alley. Did you think the portal only opens to Hell? Heaven has its own killers. They, too, are relentless and without mercy. What kind of heaven sends bounty hunters? Who do you think they would send? A carpenter wearing sandals? They intend to kill anything with the stink of Hell on it. They've also come because of the prophecy. What the hell are you talking about, old man? For thousands of years, Heaven has harvested souls... for the Army of Light. Their methods are no different than Hell's. If you do not regain your humanity... there will be no hope for the woman you claim to protect. I don't claim, old man. Anything that hurts her, I will kill. Your pride blinds you to the truth. You've brought her into view of both Heaven and Hell. Now she is a pawn in the game. - What game? - It is the prophecy! Hellspawn would plant his seed in a human woman! A child would be born! And that child would decide the outcome of Armageddon... the final battle between Heaven and Hell. No! I don't believe you! Malebolgia has tricked you again. It isn't you he wants. It's the child! Burke, got any leads on the guy who shot your partner? Heard the wacko wears a red cape. How's Twitch doing, Sam? We're all real concerned about him. Word here is Twitch is a little "touched" after the shooting. Beat it. Hey, Twitch, how you doing? Okay. You saved the bullet, Twitch? That's got to be your lucky bullet, man. It's in a safe place. Geez. For the love of Christ... you still got fucking lead in your head? Get the fuck out of here! You guys look like you're at a funeral or something. Hey, Sam, come on. You've become a regular nursemaid, Burke. I never seen your feminine side before. - Thank you, sir. - Are the pieces coming together? The shooting is still a blur, sir. When you play with matches, you can get burned. Hey, partner, you went away there for a while. There was something else about the man in the red cloak. He had claws. I don't care if the guy wears tights and a tiara. - I'm going to nail his ass. - It wasn't him. Twitch, what are you talking about? He shot you in the head. I almost lost you, buddy. The shooter pulling the trigger didn't have a clawed hand. I remember looking down the barreI of a gun. I can see a man's hand. You can see the shooter's hand, but not his face? It's like he was in shadow. No, I wanted it to be the freak in red. But maybe we're supposed to think. They found my notebook. It was all bloody. On the last page I had written the name "Jason Wynn." It makes sense now. Your mind won't let you finger the guy... because the person who shot you... is the one person you won't let be the shooter. Somebody you respected. Somebody you trusted. Do you know what you're saying, sir? Yeah. I'm talking about the chief of police. Why would he try to kill me? - Because you know something. - Sir... I don't think you should say this out loud to anyone else. Something seeped into our lives, Granny... and changed things. At night in our bed I can hear Terry breathing. I pray he's going to reach over and touch me... put his arms around me but he never does. I think he's going to leave us, Granny. That man's not going anywhere. With the baby on the way? - Yeah. - Wanda, what is it? You don't sound too happy about the baby. With everything that's happened with Terry and me... I'm thinking about having an abortion, Granny. - You can't. - There's something wrong, Granny... with this baby inside me. You look tired, Granny. Why don't you get some rest. I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work. The baby. It's not Terry's, is it? I'll call you later. It's still God's child. Help. You asked to see me? Our department is under investigation... by the NSC. - Sullivan's their new director. - I've read the papers. We got a problem, Sam. Seems like Jason Wynn had one of our cops on his payroll. - You don't say. - You know how the press... has a way of distorting the truth. Us cops have to stick together. We all should be careful about what we say. You know, you seem a little worried, Chief. We got nothing to hide. Right? Your partner's the one that worries me... what he might say. He hasn't been right... since the shooting. Twitch is fine. Out of respect for the wounds Twitch has suffered... I left your partner in place, temporarily. But as a cop, off the record, he's finished. What the hell are you talking about? - He's still far for... - Come on, Burke. He has no fucking memory. You and I both know that. Listen to me. There may be long-term damage... that we're not even aware of. This is fucking bullshit, and I'm not going to stand for it. He's the best cop on the force! You stink of booze. I'm not going to let a drunk like you ruin him. Burke. You're covering for him. Partners do that. But you can't play nursemaid to him forever. Someday, Twitch is going to forget to pull his gun... when it really counts in a situation... and somebody's going to get killed. Always bugging the fucking shit out of me. Twitch would kick his ass too, if he felt better. My career just went away. Am I correct, sir? It's Banks. I can smell it on him. It sounds like you have a very solid Iead. You've done well, Officer. - The department is proud of you. - Thank you, sir. Where the hell you going? There's something I need to take care of, sir... on my own. Al, is that you? I'm here with you, Granny. I'm so happy you came. It's hardest in the night. It looks like your whole clan came by. I'm glad we didn't lose you, Granny. Wanda and Cyan need you. I keep banging on St. Peter's gate... but he just can't hear me. It sounds like you're sorry that you're still alive. I am. I think you know what I mean. You must have regrets too. What are they? That I lived when others died... and the lives I took. God will forgive you. When I let my guard down... all the ghosts come back to me. They gather around. What could a sweet woman like you regret? That I lived so long. Your family needed you. Don't get me wrong. I'm glad I saw them all grow up. When Jack died, we were both old already. I thought I would join him soon. I lived all these years alone. You never talked much about Jack. Who would want to listen to the memories of an old woman? I do. The last thing he said to me was... "I wish you could see my wrinkled old face... the love I still have for you in my eyes." I wish you could bring Jack with you... the next time. I need to talk to him. He would know what to do about Wanda. There's something wrong. Well... Please. Granny, tell me. She's going to have a baby. - What? - But she doesn't want it. - I have to go. - Al? Al... "The Hellspawn is drawn here, to this garden of stone." "He stares at the tombs of the dead..." "wondering if they also sold their souls as he did." "He has come to the crossroads of his existence..." "and he must choose the right path..." "or he will be cursed to walk this earth alone..." "rejected by everyone." Is that your grave? This is where I belong. I've caused so much pain by coming back. You came back for your wife, for love. I would have done the same. Two more bounty hunters have come to kill me. I should let them. - They've come for me. - Why? They will treat me as a traitor. I took an oath to kill Hellspawn. It is all I've ever known. I have spared your life because of your heart. No one has ever known what is in my heart. But you can show them... by using your shroud for something good and decent. Only then will your new life begin. So, Detective, where's your slob of a partner? As I said on the phone, sir... I wanted it to be just you and me, cop to cop. Is that so? Well, you've become inconvenient. My father was a cop, my brothers, cops. A cop was all I knew. I just wanted to arrest the bad guys. When I was coming up in the ranks I admired you, sir. What do I do now? You're the bad guy. I'm taking you in tonight, sir. You okay, Twitch? So you were Jason Wynn's bitch. Twitch got too close to finding out, so you shot him. Go to Hell. Sir, stop, stop. This isn't the way. What do I do, go by the book, or do I get some justice here? My guess is that's the gun you used to shoot my partner. Am I right? Am I? I should've put a bullet in your head... like I did your partner. You can't do this, sir. You're not this kind of cop. Please, sir. Do us all a favor... Save us the paperwork and spare your wife and kids... the news flash that you were a scumbag. It would be the first time a dirty cop did the right thing. Maybe your family will still get your pension. You think they'll take your word over mine, you... dumb piece of shit? "I should've put a bullet in your head... like I did your partner." Either way you're not going to live very long. If you don't do it, your buddy Jason Wynn will do it for you... and he won't be so quick about it. Man, have you had a bad day. There's no time for regrets. If you can change and defy Hell... then I can change too, and defy Heaven. The hunters. They're here. Jade! Jade. What have I done? If I'm killed now by the hunters... my soul will descend to Hell, forever. Horrors. Just do it. - I won't let that happen. - There's a chance... that I could be allowed to go to the Elysian Fields... where warriors go, who haven't lost their honor... who have been killed by a Hellspawn in battle. I can't do that. This is not your fight. They've come for me. If you kill them, more will come. What kind of heaven would kill one of their own? Don't you feel it? It's all changing. The sides aren't as clear-cut anymore. I can't kill forever. I'm tired. I want some peace. Please... help me to end it now. Come on, Hellspawn. Fight! Please, set me free. No, Jade! I can't do this! No regrets. Will she be at peace now? I need to know. She will. Something you'll never know, Hellspawn. Kill me now. Get it over with. You're not in our contract... but we'll be back for the child. Do you trust me, Granny? I trust you, Al. I'm going to give you the one thing you wish for. Don't be afraid. Mary? Jack! - Do you see the love in my eyes? - Yes, Jack, I see it. I see it in your eyes. I want to go with you. It's not your time, Mary. People need you. Jack, please. I'll wait for you... like I always have. When you're alone in the night, I hear you talking to me, Mary. I hear your prayers. - Al. - I'm still with you, Granny. Did you see my Jack? So young and handsome. Did you hear what he said? We have to take care of the ones we love. I have only been blessed twice in my life... by the Lord and now by you. It wasn't me, Granny. It was the power of the one who sent me. What are you prepared to do? I pledge everything I own... everything I have left, my heart included. I want my humanity back.
