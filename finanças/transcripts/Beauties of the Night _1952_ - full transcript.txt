BEAUTIES OF THE NIGHT Don't wait for me. Go home. Yes, dad. - Roger. - Boss? - Where's the spanner? - I'm coming. - I'll finish it. - We're doing fine. That's much louder already. Too loud, I'd say. Your friend is a real pain with his piano. They'll hear you all right now. Progress is wonderful. But noisy. Some people love noise. Watch. Why tease him? He's unhappy. - Dreaming as usual. - He was working all night. Writing music isn't like a job. You call what you do a job? Piano lesson time. What a bore. Hurry up. - Who wrote that lovely piece? - I did. - You write music? - I've even written an opera. - To be performed when? - I don't know. I sent it to Paris. Come along. I know the Director of the Paris Opera. You haven't had my letter? I've been waiting six months. Dear sir, I cannot understand... ...how my letter went astray. Forgive me. Without further delay, I will perform your opera. He'll perform your opera. I will perform your opera. He'll perform my opera. I'll perform... ...your opera. Stop here. - Where are we? - You're with me. - What day, what month, what epoch? - The epoch of our destiny. That's not true. None of this is real. It's a dream. - Why worry if you're happy? - I won't be if I no longer see you. You'll see me as often as you wish - every night. You will see me every night... ...waiting in the shadows... ...in the depths of your dreams. You will follow my memory... ...to the ends of the earth, through the dark of the night. Within the walls of our chamber... ...our love trembles at every sound. Each little noise reminds us... ...that soon the cruel sun will rise. Farewell. If you are faithful to me in your dreams... ...you will see me again every night. The lesson seemed long to me. Not long enough to me. Here you are. No, Madame, some other time. Not today. It's about the piano. - I want my money. - You're disturbing me. Tomorrow I'll disturb you more. I'll take my piano back. Can't we have something else? - Hold on. What is it? - A radio. No, that tune. Do you know it? I do. - It's an old waltz. - What's it called? I've forgotten. It's so old. - It's from my youth. - The good old days? Not like today. Crize, wars, that's all there is. It's terrible. What with all their taxes it's terrible today. The old days were better. - How would you know? - Everyone says so. You think they didn't have their problems? Forget all that. Let's have some fun. Do be quiet. Watch this. Leaving already? Claude, don't forget your hat. Very clever. You should be ashamed, playing games at your age. Waiting in the shadows, in the depths of your dreams. You will follow my memory... ...to the ends of the earth, through the dark of the night. - Here you are at last. - I was expecting you. I was afraid I'd never see you again, never find my dream and your hand. I was in a horrible world without love. Forget it. That world is just a bad dream. I was a poor music teacher in a small town and everyone made fun of me. Here, everyone loves you. You're a famous composer. All Paris will applaud your music. They're rehearsing. They're waiting for you. A GREAT MUSICAL OCCASION Listen. You're so lucky to live in 1900. I drink to the best of epochs. Tell me, young man. What epoch do you mean? Today. You call 1900 the best of epochs? Crime, new taxes, talk of war, that's all there is. Terrible times. If you knew... The best time was when I was young. In 1830, under Louis Philippe. What good times. Men of property were happy... ...as they watched properties go up. It was so wonderful to be twenty when our young soldiers... ...with their bugles and drums... ...went to pacify Algeria. When will you come? My heart cries out. When will love tell me what my mirror reveals? What use is beauty if love cannot find it? Is your face as lovely as your eyes? - Who are you? - A musician. I've written an opera. Then your victory is complete. Even though I should resist. Just one look from him and she is ready to surrender. I'm sorry. I saw the light was on. I didn't think you'd be asleep. What do you want? You seemed upset. I wondered if I could help in any way. If you want to help, let me go back to sleep. As soon as possible. I brought back your hat. He fainted. Fetch some cool water. Wait, his eyes are opening. - What happened? - I was far away from you. You're not safe here. The battle is not yet over. My brothers will kill you. Hide! A French soldier never hides. Our army is coming. The French are coming. We must go. When will I see you again? I shall find you. Goodbye. I forgot my bugle. How fortunate I am. What wonderful times. You find this war wonderful? I joined the army under Louis XVI. It was quite different in those days. Life was different too. Those who didn't live before that damned revolution... ...don't know the sweetness of life. The sweetness of life? The sweetness of life... ...is for lovers. How my soul delights in the sweet protestations of love. Soft as the wool... ...the wool of my sheep. The shepherd who loves me is not a king's son. But this very day, I will give him my heart. I can't wait for your opera. Soft as the wool... ...the wool of my sheep. If he is bashful, I will show him pity. I will show him that I love him too. Suzanne, does that song express your feelings? Do you still doubt it? True love can never change. I will be his shepherdess since he is the shepherd. No one suspects our love. Please be discreet. Do not tell anyone our secret. Tomorrow we shall leave. We shall go and live near his sheep. Soft as the wool... ...the wool of my sheep. - You're making excellent progress. - Yes, towards a convent. Men, throw this peasant out. My intentions are honourable. You dare talk of honour? Out with him! I'm not a gentleman but love ignores the differences imposed by... By a decadent society. I'll chase him out myself. You will never chase love from lovers' hearts. Do as I say! - I like what he said. - It's a revolt! No, Marquis, a revolution! Simple souls know privilege has had its day. We must destroy turanny. We must open that prison whose walls are wet with innocents' tears. - We'll take the Bastille! - To the Bastille! Listen to that cannon. A great day has begun. - I'll bring a friend to help me. - Good. I can't hear a thing. Rev up. He's a nuisance, with his motor. How long will you be? Rev up! - Can't you knock? - I did. At this hour? Why did you come? You can collect it from the post office. - Something wrong? - Shut up! - That's not very nice. - I want to sleep and never wake. Can't you watch where you're going? You think you own the street? Remember the revolution! Leave him alone. What's wrong? I'm worried about him. I can't afford another pair. You'll have your class tomorrow. Sorry, I didn't recognize you. How are you? Fine, thanks. - What are you doing here? - The same as you. Today we meet at the post office but last night we met elsewhere. In my dreams. Shall I tell you? Sorry, darling, I forgot my stamps. You know my fianc?? - You're engaged? Congratulations. - Thank you. - Be careful! - I couldn't know you were there. I'm sorry. It's that stupid door. I couldn't know you were there. I realized I'd left my change so I came back. All's well now. So sorry. These are no use to me. I forgot my change. I forget everything. - It's love. - That's it! - The postman says I've a letter. - Today? Do you mind? I was before you. There's a queue. They're looking for my letter. Some people never queue. - It's always the same. - I won't be long. Ask for his identity card. Have you an identity card? It's a registered letter. - How much is this? - I won't be long. - This is an urgent letter. - They want my identity card. - I was before him! - No, I was waiting here. They wanted my card. - It's out of date. - Your card isn't valid. - Since when? - A month ago. - I was the same man a month ago. - We don't know that. - What shall I do? - My letter is urgent! Shut up! Come back with a valid card. - To collect my letter? - You need your military papers... ...a residence certificate, two photographs... - And two French witnesses. - Is that all? - It's the law. - Is it really? You know quite well who I am. Not officially. Please leave. - Give me my letter! - I need an identity card. Here's one. Not enough? If it's paper you want, I'll give you paper! Stop that man! - You're waiting for me? - No, for my piano. Do you mind waiting downstairs? You can't take that down the stairs. Come and see. You can't because... Because I'm keeping it! Fetch the police! Calm down. He's a friend. That's no excuse for what he did. - He's not like us. - He's a musician. - He's nice. - He wasn't today. - Maybe he was upset. - He's usually so nice. I'll talk to him. If they could stop him playing at night... That lunatic won't give me my piano back. He tried to kill me. It must be one of his bad days. Claude, open the door. - Who's that? - L?on and Roger. - Leave me alone. - L?on wants a word. What's been going on? I'm fed up - with everything! - So you create a disturbance? - It was self defence. So you both want to lodge a complaint? Right. Name and address. What's all this? - It's the law. - You don't know me either? - Not in my official cap... - Right. You shouldn't have done that. It's L?on's cap. Throw it up! Run after him and apologize. Your cap has flown back upstairs. - This is no time for jokes. - It's true. - Come with me. - L?on, no! I'm taking you in. - Where are you going? - He's our friend. - I suppose you're proud of yourself. - How could you? - A school friend. - Who did your homework. - What gratitude. - Putting friends in prison. - You want to go to prison too? - Why not? Coming, Paul? Don't be silly. - You won't arrest us? - What for? - Insulting a policeman. You bastard. - Tum-coat. That's too much! - Shyster! - Pig! - Come inside. - We'll teach you manners. They're my friends. We play cards together. They were only joking. - We weren't joking. - I'll never play with you again. - Let's have a drink. - No fear. - We'll sort this out. - Too late. - He's in prison now. - He's done for. - Things were bad. - No family. - No success. - No hope. - He was behaving oddly this morning. - So you said. If he killed himself it wouldn't surprise me. It's not true. Imagine his thoughts now. You let it go. - It's free. - I'll catch it again. Watch them for me. - Everything's ready. - My love. - At dawn you'll be mine. - I can't believe it. - Where's Suzanne? - I don't know. You're useless. At cock-crow I shall be waiting for you here. I wish the cock had crowed already. - What will you do with her? - Marry her. - Before God? - Before nature and the Supreme Being. - Where are you going? - To happiness. - Who are you? - A man of the people. - It's Claude. - Long live Claude. - Peace is signed. You may stand down. - No, General, I shall keep watch. For him, the key to my door. The key to my heart, for him. There is no fortress that love cannot enter at night. When the moon rises... ...your love will come to you. - Let us take over, Colonel. - No, I must keep my eye on things. This is the key to her room. This is the key to her heart. When the moon rises... When the moon rises... ...your love will be waiting for you. Waiting for me? Dream, beautiful dream. I'm singing as they do at the Opera. Wonderful. I was at the rehearsal. It's the best music ever written for the Opera. I must embrace the composer. Not like that. Don't you see those people staring? I see no one but you. Why are they here? To meet you. They're all here because of you. The Director of the Opera. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. The Minister of Fine Arts, the Secretary of the Institute. The Prime Minister. - Go and greet him. - I want to be alone with you. - Not now. - You always say that. - Tonight after dinner, I'll be alone. - Tonight? - After dinner. - After dinner? - You're not free? - I am. Moonrise, cock-crow... - Edm?e, I'm so happy. - Quiet. They might hear us. Quiet! They might hear you. Let us not disturb the lovers. I feel so bashful. We know you feel bashfull... ...but we want you to be happy. Till tonight. We must wait. Till tonight. You must wait till you're alone. - Till we're alone. - Until tonight. - Don't be late. - Late? Till tonight. You must wait till you're alone. Quiet, they might hear. The President of the Republic. Mr. Roger, Mr. L?on. - It's all settled. - You can go. - Why have you come? - To fetch you. I'm sorry. I was in the wrong. - Leave me alone. - No, we're your friends. - I withdrew my complaint. - Cheer up! - You're free. - Free to live. In this world? - He's torn his trousers. - Be quiet. - What's the world done to you? - I just want to escape. You see? Oh, no. You think he'd do that? Can you swim? - I can't save a man who wants to die. - Maybe he was better off in prison. - He seems lost. - He'll be run over. No, he's fine. - He's coming back. - The crossroads. You're blocking the pavement. - It's your piano? - No but... Where are your papers? Check them. How are you? L?on is a swine. - What do you want? - Sleeping pills. You're right. A good night's sleep and you'll forget everything. Exactly. I've better ones. As long as they're strong. - Have you a prescription? - No. Why? - You can't have them then. - I won't tell anyone. - You never know. Accidents happen. - I only want to sleep. Without a prescription? Nothing simpler. Go to bed, close your eyes and count sheep. It really works. No one ever reaches three hundred. - I'll smash up your shop. - Go ahead. I'm not the boss. Listen, I'll give you just one for tonight. - What did he want? - Sleeping pills. You swallow the lot and never wake. - He'd do that? - He mustn't be left alone. Tell your boss that from now on we'll pay him regularly. - Now you can play whenever you like. - What for? They can have their piano. Look, a new pair of trousers. Try them on. What for? - What would you like? - Sleeping pills. Forget that. - You're young. - You've a life to live. From the vine to the grape. From the grape to wine. Here's to the lovely grape. - Where are you going? - Stay! - Look what my wife cooked for you. - I'm not hungry. - Force yourself. Eat, laugh, drink. - Look! Two trumps. Incredible. You've won again. - You're so lucky. - No, he's just a better player. Look at your winnings. - What's the time? - Your lucky hour. Make the most of it. I don't feel well. - What? - You're ill? Why did you make me eat so much? - And this cigar... - Put it out. A little brandy to help you digest? It's on me. No, I've had enough. - What's the time? - Twenty past ten. I must go. - Stay! - You never have any fun. - Why the hurry? - I've an appointment. - The light's gone off. - Already. It's very odd. Anything could happen. We'd better go up. - He's muttering. - What's he saying? Three hundred and forty-five, three hundred and forty-six sheep. We'd better stay here. You've lost. Can't you play elsewhere? It's nicer here. It's a change. - How do you feel? - I ate too much. I can't sleep. - You tried counting sheep? - Over three thousand of them. - That's odd. - Give me those pills or I'll kill you! - Give him one. - It can't hurt. I'm in a hurry. He took three. You'll never get up tomorrow. Leave me alone. I'm late. - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. - What time do you call this? - Midnight. You're late. I did my best. Love doesn't keep special hours. But husbands do! You're married? - Did you hear something? - I heard nothing. - We're alone and the time has come. - Too late. You scared me. I didn't know you were here. - To whom were you talking? - No one. That's the only door. This is all your fault. - You never said you were married. - You were late. The musician. I knew it! - Where is he? - What do you mean? No! His opera starts tomorrow. All the more reason. The moon is setting. He didn't come. Come inside. Your brothers will return soon. I heard something. It's him! - Your brothers may come. - Who cares? The veil before my face... ...I shall lift for you. Only for you. In your country, women are less shy. Their only veil their rouge... ...which protects nothing from the eye's caress. But my beauty remained unknown... ...until it was unveiled to my lover's eyes. If it seems that I am naked... ...that's how I wish to be for him. But for him alone. Colonel, this is an honour. Don't be afraid. We only want... A small souvenir of your visit. - He was to come at cock-crow. - All the cocks have crowed. Do you hear that noise? Here is the daughter. - We came just in time. - Now we have them all. Where's Suzanne? Why are you crying? If only you'd been on time. I know, I know. I can still save her! - You can't go in. - Don't you know me? Long live the Republic! Where are you going? Death for them all! You're in a hurry. - This way. - I don't want to go there. Too bad. Don't you know me? Where's my sash? Where are you going? Is this your identity card? It has expired! No longer valid. - That's no reason to execute me. - It's the law! - What awful times. - Awful times indeed! - France was so peaceful once. - I wish I'd lived under Louis XIII. Me too. My great-uncle told me many times that people were happy then. He was a friend of d'Artagnan. D'Artagnan, we are here. I can take care of both of them. I want you to meet the woman I love. - Do you hear? - Lovely voice. Her teacher is very pleased with her. Your voice and face grow more lovely each day. How could I hate my lessons with a teacher like you? I give them with all my heart. Those were the good old days. - It's my fault you're here. - I thought I'd never see you again. I so wanted this revolution. Little did I know we would be its victims. You said it would demand sacrifices. The future happiness of the people seems so far away. - I wish we could know it. - And live in the twentieth centrury. They'll be such good times. Your father wouldn't be a marquis. He'd be a worker and I'd help him. I'd teach music to children. - We'd live in the same village. - And be neighours. - I'd see you every day from my window. - One day, on the way home... You'd say... I love you. I'd ask why you'd waited so long. Nothing in those blessed times... ...could prevent our happiness. What a dream. What a dream. Farewell. We'll soon be together again... ...in another world. - What do you want? - A head. - Why mine? - Why not? Hurry up! - What's my crime? - How should I know? - I want to talk to the people. - They all do. That sleep did you good, didn't it? - We're still here. - You need more sleep. You'll like that. Into bed with you. I don't want to sleep any more. - What do you want? - To play cards. - We're tired. - It's late. You want to sleep, then you don't. Claude, you can't stay there all night. I don't want to go back to my dreams. You're here? I thought you... You're here with me in the middle of the night. It doesn't seem real. Why are you here? I heard noises. I was worried. Why? Answer me. Because of you. I was afraid I'd never see you again. Am I really awake? Your eyes are wide open. - When I dream, I think they're open. - And you see me? As I see you now. But I'm awake. This is the twentieth century. You live next door. We're in another world and I've found you again. It's unbelievable. I'm not dreaming. I'm happy. My happiness is real. That's real. And so is this. Listen. I'm not dreaming. - It's my father. - That's real too. Go quickly! - Roger, come for a walk. - Not at this hour. I'll come up then. I'm a happy man. What a fool I was. I couldn't see happiness was right here, next door. You don't care, do you? I do, I do. - I'm happy and you don't care. - You're wrong. - Are you my friend or not? - Of course I am. I'm afraid of going to sleep. Make me some coffee. Just as I feared. Those pills make me sleep as soon as I stop talking. My dreams come back. They're there waiting for me, watching me. How can I get rid of them? Do anything you like but leave me alone. All right, I'll go home and fight on alone. Be selfish, sleep all you like. Don't get up. You meet men like that at night? I don't. I told you... A musician and he's been in prison. - He was only there an hour. - Long enough. You were there all night once. The police made a mistake. A piano teacher. Go ahead and marry him if you want to starve. Who says he wants me? Anyway musicians make too much noise. What about car mechanics? So your friend has something against mechanics? That good-for-nothing. Haven't you heard him play? Exactly! Playing music is no worse than having dirty hands. Maybe he despises us manual workers. That would be a bit much. If I said: ''I'll give you my daughter''... ...he'd say: ''I don't want a father-in-law with dirty hands''. If he did that, I'd punch him on the nose with my dirty hands. I've a good mind to do it right now. Don't turn it down. Bring me a coffee. Make it strong. And now a lullaby. ''Sleep, my little boy''. Sleep, my little boy. Let your eyelids close. Sleep, my little boy. He asked us to keep him awake. Sleep will do him good. At the Opera tonight... ...you can see the first performance... ...of a great opera. The composer knows how to please and tonight will see his triumph. But dawn will see his end by the gun or the sword. At the Opera... ...you can see the first performance tonight... ...of a great opera. Our client has chosen the sword and the gun. - He wants to fight a duel? - And kill you. Sleep, my little boy. Let your eyelids close. If you'd only listen to me, brother... ...your anger would be appeased. Have mercy on this handsome soldier. He has written an opera. These valiant Algerians have agreed you may marry their sister at once. General, I never wanted to be married. What were you doing here then? - I order you to marry her! - Impossible. You'll be shot. Take him away! Stop that man! Fire! It's him. I wish I'd lived in the Golden Age. What terrible times. For you too? Help, help! Just look where you were. PRE-HISTORY THE FLOOD It rains a lot here. There's a rainbow! Look, a breakdown. Very friendly. - What roads. - They're repairing them. ROMAN EMPIRE 29 BC MIDDLE AGES 1000 AD The blighter! - Good thing we ducked. - Where's our top? 17TH CENTURY I think the tank's empty. - We won't find any petrol here. - We can't wait three hundred years. Where are you off to? There's a police road block. Never mind that. 18TH CENTURY FRENCH REVOLUTION Don't stop. Keep going! We've been waiting for you! It's a long way. - We're almost back. - Not quite. What's left? 1900. What is it? Look what they did to the car. - Surely they won't follow us here. - Don't ask me. It's your fault, bothering those people in the past. - Couldn't you stay in your own times? - They're not that bad. - Close the door! - It won't stop them. - There's nothing we can do. - What'll happen? - There's only one solution. - What? - There's only one solution. - What? I must wake up. That was a lullaby. One very strong coffee. What's wrong with my hands? They may be dirty but it's honest dirt. - He's not having my daughter. - Explain yourself. - It's up to him to explain. - Give him time. He should explain to Suzanne and apologize too. Here's your letter. - No need for an identity card. - I copied your signature. You could at least see who it's from. The National Opera. - What do they want? - I sent them something six months ago. - An opera. - You wrote an opera? - He wrote an opera? - You hear that? He wrote an opera? This will be their rejection. They took their time. - Open it. - You do it. Who says it's a refusal? - Exactly. - It may not be. ''...come to our office the afternoon of the 22nd. Yours sincerely.'' A rejection. - Who can say? - You don't know. - It's a registered letter. - Signed ''Yours sincerely''. - You think they'd write... - From Paris. - Registered. - To reject your opera? - When's the 22nd? - Today. - When's the Paris train? - 12.30. - What's the time? - 12.35. The train has already left. What are cars for? That's true! - By car... - We'll soon be there. There's music and music. His will be played at the Opera. - Still there? - Right behind us. Who? The others. The boss, Paul, L?on. I won't go in. Tell your director he should find another job. They always blame me. Come in. Have you a letter? They're all alike when we reject their music. - Of course. - We can't play everyone's operas. - I understand. - I'm glad someone does. His opera stood as good a chance as yours. Stay here, I'll fetch it. Number 45. - What did he say? - You heard. They're giving me my opera back. They don't want it. You're lucky. I didn't have to look far. Do I look as if I'd write a ''Nebuchadnezzar''? You wouldn't know how. Wait a minute. There must be some mistake. I'm not sad. I've finished with music. All I want is to sleep. Wake me if I dream. They scare me. Who do? I see I'm a mechanic. I wanted to write music. But they don't want my music. So I'm selling petrol by the litre. How many litres, sir? Fifty? That's what fate decreed. Claude, wake up. You're dreaming. It's a dream. Wake up, it's late. - I think they've forgotten us. - Where are we? We mustn't stay here. They must be somewhere. - This place is so big. - Maybe they're downstairs. Where's the exit? - Excuse me, where's the exit? - Ask the doorman. He didn't come? - Who? - The composer I'm expecting. Claude... Number 45. He's here but I can't find his opera. Of course not. We're using it. - Fetch the composer. - He's my daughter's fianc?. I'm not dreaming! THE END
