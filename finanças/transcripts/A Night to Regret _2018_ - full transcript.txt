- Help! No! Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm late! Sorry! Oh crap! Oh my God! Eric, what are you doing? You scared me half to death! - Sorry, I didn't mean to. I knew you had this class next and I saw you running outside. I kind of figured you weren't gonna make it. Did Professor Meador lock you out again? - Yeah. I got caught up writing. So, what's up? Your classes are all the way across campus right now. - Yeah, can we talk about something? - If this is about your mother's birthday party, I'm sorry. I got caught up writing and then I started studying and I told you I probably couldn't make it anyway. - So can we talk? - Yeah. You're breaking up with me? Be honest, are you cheating? - No, I'm not cheating on you. - Then what? - Look Chelsea, I'm sorry, okay, but, just, you never have time for me. You know, like I'm not a priority in I'm sorry, but, I'm done. - Listen, when I am done with this film, I promise things will get better. Please don't do this. It's my mom. - I gotta go anyway. And I'm late. - Please don't go. - I'm sorry. - Eric, wait! Hi Mom. - Hey Sweetie, how are you? - Eric just split up with me. - What? Why? - I'm not really sure. - Baby, I'm so sorry. - Yeah, I'll tell you more when I get home. Okay, yeah, we'll talk then. - Bye. - Bye. - Jake! Jake, where are you? I need your help gettin' down the stairs. My knees are hurtin' again. Jake? Jake? Oh, ahhhhhh! - I told you to be careful, mother. The stairs are so dangerous. - Seriously, come on, okay? There are plenty of other fish in the sea. - Yeah, right. Look right there. See? Mmhmm. - Hi there. Is your name Chelsea? - Yes. Yes, I'm Chelsea, do I know you? - No, I'm Liam. Mila sent me over here to invite you guys to our table for some drinks. - Mila Walters? - The one and only. Come on! Eddy, put their drinks on us. - Who's Mila? - Do you remember that girl from high school? - Oh my God! The girl that got held back and then was kicked out of school. Yeah, I remember her getting in trouble all the time. - Yeah, we used to hang out all the time in grade school. I always wondered what happened to her. - Well, let's find out. - Chelsea, hey! - Hi! You remember Sarah, right? - I think so. Hi! - Hey. - Come sit down with us. Jenny, two more glasses for my friends over here. Oh, and another bottle of champagne. - Are you guys celebrating something? - Just life. - At least you're not moping about what's his name anymore. Bye. - Goodbye. - Chelsea, you coming with us? I have a car waiting outside. C'mon, let's go. Want some champagne? - Oh, I'm okay. I've had enough. I have a test tomorrow. - Got it. So, what do you think? - This place is incredibly nice. - Well, the place next door is for sale. I wish. - Ah, come on. Once you sell your movie script and become a big time writer and director, you'll have all the money in the world to buy it. So when are you gonna let me read it? - Really? - Yeah. - You wanna read my script? - I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to. - Most people would just rather wait for the movie. - Well, not me. I'd love to read it! - Okay. Well, how about I get your email and I'll send it to you tomorrow. - Cool. - But you're gonna have to do it, 'cause I'm kind of tipsy. - Ah, you know what, I'm a really good hacker but I cannot get past this fingerprint scanner, if you can do that for me. [Sorry, here. There you go. There you go. - Sweet! So are you and Mila? - No, well a long time ago. We're business partners now. We both own that club. - Oh, wow! Yeah. She's, she's kinda like a sister to me. You know I kind of just hang out and make sure she doesn't do anything too crazy. And there's a lot of crazy things in Mila's life. - What about you? Are you crazy like Mila? - No, I'm not crazy! But there are definitely moments in my life that are completely nuts. - Yeah? - Yeah. Like what? What's so, what's so nuts in your life. Boyfriend? - Yes. No. As of 12 hours ago, I am newly single. - Oh, so it's a rough day for you. - Yeah, I didn't see it comin'. - A little something to help her relax. C'mon you guys. The show's about to start. - After you. - Oh, this is for you. - Oh I shouldn't, I have a test tomorrow. C'mon, just one more. It's my special champagne. - So, what's going on? - Here's to us making your movie together. - Well, that would be great, but how? - Well I have a little business and I make a lot of money. - What is it? - Interactive entertainment. - Mila, please don't tell me or web cam girl or something. - I'll tell you this. I make great money. When I got kicked out of school it was the last straw for my parents. We got into a huge fight and I ran away. - We all thought that you moved away. - Yeah, well that's what my parents told people. Look, I've made a lot of bad decisions in my life and I've screwed up a lot of things. But, right now this is working for me. It might not be exactly what I want to be doing but, it makes me a lot of money. - Really? A lot of money? - Yeah, look around. This is all because of my business. - Woah! This champagne is really strong. - It's gotta little kick, right? - Yeah, to say the least! - What's in this again? - Just some good champagne, plus a little something to help you relax. - I think I just need to take it slow. Wait, what? What? What's in this? - Don't worry. - Mila... - Just chillax. The show's about to start. Oh. Huh, it's time for a new show. Hmm. Hello ladies. Let's see the new girl. - No, the new girl is not dancing tonight. She is stunning. - He says you're stunning. - You have gotta be kidding me. - She thinks you're kidding. C'mon, why don't you throw in another $100 and show her you're serious. Sure. Here you go. - He just doubled his amount. That's 200 bucks! C'mon, do a little dance for the man. I feel silly. I don't know what I'm doing. - C'mon. Feel the music. You look so pretty. C'mon! You're a natural. What am I doing? Just relax! Feel the music. - Ooh! I love you. - You're a natural. - You happy Mila? I want to marry you. - He says he loves you and he wants to marry you. You're a hit! Seriously? Well you look like hell. - Yeah, I feel even worse. - What time did you get in last night? - 4:30? - What? - I missed my torte class this morning, out of all classes. - Was it worth it? Is Mila gonna finance the movie? - We didn't even really talk about that. I'm actually super worried. You're not gonna believe what I did. - You slept with that Liam guy, didn't you? - No! - Did you call Eric? - No! It's worse! - What then? - You wanna know how Mila makes her money? She runs a website, where girls take off their clothes and boys tip 'em online. - Oh God, no, Chels, you didn't. - I did. How bad? - Topless. - Why, why would you do that? - I don't know. I was drunk and everyone was doing it and there were, there were guys literally paying me hundreds of dollars to take off my top! - So what? I don't know. I guess I didn't wanna seem like a prude. It was fun. Like we were having fun and last summer, my mom and I we went to France and we were topless on the beach and that wasn't a big deal. - Gross, and, not the same thing. How could you let this happen? Chelsea, this is. - I don't know. Every time I hang out with Mila she has a way of talking me into doing the wrong thing. - Well, this one's on you, not her, so. - I know it. You're right. We used to hang out when we were younger. And it was always trouble. It started out as a little fun and then she always sort of Thelma and Louises me, you know? Like, this could be the last day of your life. - But it's not, and now you have tomorrow to deal with. And, Thelma & Louise never took their tops off online. And, now what, there's topless videos of you on the internet and you can't just take those down! - I know okay, I tried to go to the website. I tried to log on and delete anything that was posted. - Okay. You need to call him Mila. - Yeah, well I'll just talk to her in person, because I left my jacket at her house. - Just get that done by tonight, okay? Hey, Chels! Here it is. - Thanks. And this. - What is this? - Your take from last night. - About that. I really need you to delete what's ever on that website. It can really affect my career. - There's no recording. It's all live. - So it's gone? Completely? - Yeah. I mean, there's some stills, but that's it. - Can I access the website so I can see? - Of course. I'll give you a code so you don't have to pay. Do you wanna do that now? - I do, but is that Liam's computer? Is he here? - Yeah, it's his computer, but no, he left. He'll be back in a little. Hey do you have a thing for Liam? - What? No, gosh no! Eric and I just broke up. But I really hope it's not over. Liam told me he would read my script. - Ah, anyway, this is the easiest money you'll ever make. Look, If you don't want to do it, that's fine. I do it 'cause that's how I survive. It got me off the streets. And plus, we all had a little bit of fun didn't we? - Mila, you spiked my drink! - We all experienced a little mood enhancement. And you were so much fun! No, you always seem to have fun. And I'm the one that seems to get in trouble. - Yeah, well unlike me, you actually had a mother that cared about you. So, yeah, you got in trouble. I know that Beverly never wanted you to hang out with me. I guess I never realized how lucky you were. - Look, this isn't right. Not like this, and it's not me. But I will take your money, as an investment. Welcome to the film business. - He says he loves you and he wants to marry you. You're a hit! He says he loves you and he wants to marry you. You're a hit! - Hi Mom! Hi Dean. - Hey Chels. - You're in a good mood! Did you get your essay back? Or, are you and Eric back together? - No. I'm not back together with Eric. But, I do think that I aced my essay. - That's my girl. You are gonna make a fabulous lawyer. - Speaking of careers, did you hear back for your promotion? - They want her to interview. - What? Why, you've been working for that company for six years! - I know, but they want to keep it open for outside candidates. But, not to worry, I can do that job in my sleep. - Yeah, I know you can. Well, I'm gonna hit the books until dinner's ready. - Bye! A thousand dollars? Time for a show? I don't think so. Sorry but that was my one and only show. Not gonna happen. Good. You're too cute and classy to be doing that type of stuff. What do you really do for a living? Chelsea, come on. Dinner's ready! - Okay, Mom. Sorry, gotta go. So, I deposited the money this morning which means I'm that much closer to getting my movie made. - So Mila's gonna be in it? - Yeah, it was a small price to pay for getting it made. I'm just excited to call Abby and tell her that we're good to go. She's gonna have to use money to use that camera. - Yeah, just hope it all works out. - What do you mean? - I mean, you really think it's that good of an idea to be so closely tied with Mila? - Your point? - That you can be too trusting sometimes. And sometimes you're a little naive to people's real motives. - Really. So what do you think she wants? - Chels, I don't know exactly, okay. I just I get weird vibes from Mila. Liam too. - Well, I really like them. And they're actually super supportive. What, okay. I'm constantly telling you how great I think your writing is. I just don't have thousands of dollars to give to you. - Okay, don't act like that. I know that she has reasons for what she's doing. - Yeah, I'm sure she does. - I gotta get to class. Abby, Hey! Good news. We get to make the movie. Cut! That was good. Awesome! Great. Okay, one more angle, and then we can move on. Okay. You guys are doing amazing. Thank you so much. So Mila still isn't here. She was supposed to be here over an hour ago. - We're losing our good light. - I'm just gonna text her and tell her, you know what, it's off. - Hey there big director. How's it going? I'm ready for my close up. - Did you not get any of my text messages? You're over an hour late. - I'm sorry I guess I didn't check my phone. - Well there's not gonna be any more daylight by the time we get to your scene. - Don't stress. We can do my scene another day. Let's hit up happy hour. On me. - No, Mila, I'm not going to happy hour, okay? And we can't do your scene another day because all the money we made yesterday, went to today! So I'm broke again. Okay everybody back to first positions. - Listen, I'm sorry I'm late. I get that every dollar counts, okay? I know how that feels. I'll invest in your movie. - What? I mean technically you've already invested in my movie. - Forget about that, okay? I messed up your day, so let me make it up to you. And we'll start over. All I ask is that I get the money back within a year. Oh and don't kick me out of your movie. I am a really good actress. - Are you serious? - How much do you need? Hi, again. - Oh, great. Hey Chelsea, I'm sorry about that scene today. All my fault. I hope the extra thousand dollars is helpful and if you need any more money I'm here for you. We're having fun! See you soon! Bye. - Oh, what? Am I live? What are you doing? No, no, no, no, no. Chelsea Bilson. - Chelsea? Camera rentals? Chelsea. Hey, this is Eric. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you. - Hey Eric, it's me. Just called to say hi. I have a belated birthday card for your mom and I was hoping that I could get it to you at some point. Look, I know that I haven't really been there for you with everything that's going on and, I'm sorry. Maybe we can meet up some time to discuss it. Anyway, well, I hope I see you at school today. Okay, bye. Chelsea, what's going on? - Nothing. What are you doing with those? - You're supposed to be studying for your law classes and you're making a movie? - Mom, I can do both. I always have before. - Maybe, but the classes are getting more difficult each year. You need to focus. - I will. Don't worry, mom. - That's a lot of money you're spending on your film. Where is it all coming from? - I tutor now. In the student center. It makes me a lot of money. - When do you have time for that? - While I'm studying too. It's the same material so it helps me out. - I want you to promise that you're not gonna work on your film until the end of the year. Because you don't have time for all of this, and your schoolwork will suffer. - Mom, don't do this to me! Please, I promise you I will work hard and I will focus. - Well, I am working hard and I am paying a lot of money. I can't afford to have you fall behind. - Yeah, but mom, what if they give me a film scholarship? Then you wouldn't have to work so hard. - Why did you keep this from me? - I don't know. Maybe because you do work so hard. I didn't want to worry you. And you're finally up for that big promotion. I know how much that means you. - Well, I know how much you love making your films. But you're gonna be a lawyer, and you're gonna have a much better life than I was able to give you. - Mom, what are you talking about? We have an amazing life. Don't ever say that. Remember, you and me right? - Yeah, you and me babe. Awe, you. Whew. I have to get to work. Don't you get your exam grades back today? - Yes, mother. And I will keep you posted. Hey, good luck on that promotion! Chelsea, congratulations on your award. Tell us what inspires you. - Well my biggest inspiration is my mom, Beverly, growing up without a father, she was just the biggest role model to me. So, eek, this ones for you, mom! Thank you! Beverly Bilson. Westvale insurance. I'm sorry. I'm a mess. Thanks. Hey, you look like you could use a smile. It's that obvious, huh? I'm just having a bad day. - What's wrong? I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry. - It's okay. I just, I got passed over for a promotion. I mean I'll survive. I just really thought that I would get it. - That is disappointing. I'm sorry to hear it. Thanks. - Sorry, I'm so rude. I'm Jake. I manage the Metro Street Gym in the neighborhood. - Beverly, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I feel like there's something I can do for you. - Well, I doubt that. What's done is done. - No, not that. I'm giving away free gym memberships. Sorry, trying to give away free gym memberships. It doesn't seem like anybody in this building is interested. I think that this is exactly what you need to take your mind off of this little setback. - It is just a little setback. Looks that way. - Free gym membership? What's the catch? No catch. It's just three free months and three personal training sessions. - Wow, that does sound great. - It is. At least it will be. I will make sure of it. Look, there is nothing better for a bad day than a good workout. - You say all the right things, don't ya? - I try. So, what do you say? Maybe come by after work one day, I'll give you the tour, and a free bottle of my own supplements. No pressure. - Yeah, perhaps. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, Beverly. - So what did ya get? - Not good. - Sorry. I know it's been kinda rough on you lately. You gonna tell your mom? - I'm so screwed. - Hey, what's up? - Jake, you have a client? - Sure, send them in. Hey, you! - Hey, I'm here. - I wasn't sure you'd make it. - I wasn't either. - I hope those are gym clothes. - Um hmm. Great. Let's do it Extras needed. PM me for details. Come in. - Hey, how's it going today? - I'm alright. I'm sorry about your promotion. - Thanks. You know, there'll be another chance. - Yeah. - You know what I did today? I found us a great deal, and I joined a gym. So now, we both have memberships and a personal trainer. - Wow. Thanks. But I don't know if I'm gonna have time to do all that. - I think it's important that we spend a little bit more time together. C minus? Chelsea. I know that it is hard with you and Eric breaking up, and school is getting more difficult, but this just proves my point. The movie is too much! - Mom, no it's not! Please, just let me handle it. I've really gotta do this, okay? Look, I actually wanted to get my work done before I go to bed, so. - Okay. But, if you need any help with anything, just let me know. - Thanks, but I'm fine. Great, cut! That was awesome. Let's move to close-ups. - Okay. - Hey. How's it all editing together? - It's so awesome! Yeah? - It's going great. Yeah. Is that Liam? - Hey girls. Any room for one more extra? See, I told you I'd come. Even if it was a Sunday. This looks, it looks great! Yeah it's great. It's a lot of work. It looks amazing. Chels, the batteries? - Oh! Right. Give me a second. Hey Chels, wait up! - I have to grab the batteries outta my car, what's up? - Who's that guy staring at you? Where? Wait, he was there like two seconds ago, I swear. - Come on. What's this. - Who do you think they're from, Eric? - No, he wouldn't leave something on my car. - Liam? - Angels trumpets for my angel. I doubt it was Liam. What do you think happened to that guy? - I don't know. It's like he vanished. It's kind of creepy. - I'm really happy we're doing this together. Hey, Jake! This is my daughter, Chelsea. - It is a pleasure to meet you Chelsea. I've heard a lot of good things from your mother. I've got a great workout planned, and you both get a bottle of my very own supplements. Are you excited? - Yeah, I guess! - Yes, yes, great! Let's put a smile on that face with a good workout. Are you ladies ready? Sounds good. - Cool, let's do it. He says you're stunning. Do a little dance for the man. C'mon! Now do a turn. You're a hit. He says he loves you and he wants to marry you. Ooh! - Thank you so much, Jake. - Good night, ladies. I'll see you soon. Look at this. They have no problem posting anything about their lives, for everyone to see it. - Here's a nightclub. That's Mila. Chelsea's back in touch with her? Why would she have anything to do with her? In high school, Mila and Chelsea were out, and she shoplifted a necklace. Chelsea didn't know anything about it. - What happened? - Well Mila got arrested and Chelsea got taken down to the police station and questioned. I had to go pick her up. - Wow. - She was so scared. - Well, I wouldn't worry about Chels honey. She's got a good head on her shoulders. I mean, what could this Mila girl possibly do, right? Where have you been, Pretty Pamela? How'd you get my number? Or should I say Chelsea? Who are you? How did you find me? Did you get my flowers today? I'm gonna report you. To who? For what? I've done nothing! And I've done nothing to you. Please stop! I can't help it. I wanna be near you. I'm blocking you. That was a beautiful sun dress you were wearing today. Yes, I know where you live. You are so beautiful! Well, has he threatened you? - No. - This is Mila's fault. I told you, she's a nightmare. - What should I do? - You should call the police. - And tell them what? If my mother finds out, it will kill her. No, you know what? No, she would kill me first! This is such a mess. - Listen you deleted the channel, so there's no evidence that you did the webcam thing. - What have I done? I wasn't even thinking straight! It's just, I'm such an idiot. - You should confront Mila, okay, she's the one that got you into this, she should help you clean it up. - Yeah, I agree. - This is scary, Chelsea. - You deleted your channel, but we still have his screen name. Maybe we can use that to track him down. - Okay. But how? - We can try to track him on the website. - How long will that take? - I'm not sure. Liam? - I mean it's gonna take some work. It won't happen overnight. - Great! So in the meantime, what, he's just gonna show up in my bedroom? I have to call the police! That's a bad idea. If you do, they're gonna investigate you and all your friends. - What's wrong? You have something to hide? - Liam's right. I've dealt with the police enough to know that the first person they're gonna want to talk to is your mom. - I don't know what to do. - Just give us a few more days to get some information on this guy. - Mila, what if I don't have a few more days? - You sure you don't want me to follow you home? Maybe if this guy sees me, he'll back off. - I'm okay. But thanks. - Okay. Don't worry. We're gonna find this guy and make him stop. Bye girls. - Bye. - You sure he's not your stalker? Man. - Eric wants to meet me for coffee. - Oh look, okay. Things are already getting better. - Yeah. - It's cute. Okay, I should head out, huh? Eric's gonna be here any second. So, you okay? - I'm okay. Thanks for hanging out with me. - Of course, Chels. What are friends for? Good luck. - Jake! Hey, Jake. - Hi. And they say you never run into anyone in Los Angeles. - Yeah, what are you doing at the park? - I'm just working out with a client. Do you want some company? - Oh, I'm actually, I'm waiting for my boyfriend. - Oh, I understand. Is everything alright? You have a sadness in your eyes. Anything I can do to help? - Oh. No, I'm fine. I've just been crazy frazzled but, everything's ok. - Well, remember, we have a lot of work to do. You and me. So don't be a stranger. - I won't, I promise. - Alright. Can I get a smile? It's easy, right? Alright, tell your mom I said hi, okay? - I will. - I'll see you soon. - Bye. Hey, sorry I'm late. - Hi. I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks. - Yeah, I know. I felt like we should meet up. You know we left things a little weird last time we talked. - Yeah. Eric I'm really sorry. - Me too. I could have been more understanding but, it's just I really feel like you weren't putting in any more effort with me, you know? - I never meant to hurt you. Maybe we can start over? - Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. How about we go to dinner tomorrow. - A date? - Yeah. I would love that. - Gotcha! - Hi there. - Hey. Can I help you? - No, it's cool. I just, I was looking for a friend's house. I was looking for a friend's house. I was looking for a friend's house. I was looking for a friend's house. I was looking for a friends house, I must have the wrong place. Sorry to bother you. - Actually, wait a minute. I'm kind of lucky that you stopped by. You got a minute? I've got a bad back, and I've got this box in the truck I really need to get out. It's right over there. I'd really appreciate it man, you'd really be helping me out. - Yeah, sure. Why not? Cool. - This is a nice place you have. - Thanks. It was my mom's, before she died. - I'm sorry to hear that. - It was sudden. She had an accident here at the house. Wow, that's terrible. Fell down the stairs and broke her neck. I'm sorry. - Must be really difficult. Yeah, it's locked. - Let me get that for you. Ah, there's no box in there. Ah! - Hey, I'm going to bed. I didn't see you today. I hope it was better. Good night. - Mom? I'm sorry. I've been really screwing up lately. - I'm also sorry if I've been causing you any extra stress. I know that I can push a little hard sometimes. - I just feel like I'm drowning every single day at school. But, I know it's important for me to get a degree. You've helped me so much and I just, I don't wanna let you down. - Sweetheart, you have never disappointed me. I am so proud of who you've become. - Thank you. I love you. - Yeah, I love you too. So much! Angels trumpets. Beautiful. Potent. Natures' chloroform. - Hey, Sara. - Hey Chels. - Okay, so let's plan to carpool tomorrow and then we'll meet my mom at Metro Street Gym. Probably around six when she gets off work. I think you need to go to the website and get a visitor's pass. - Okay, yeah. I'll do it before I head over in the morning. You're sure it's cool I go? - Yeah, of course. And Sara, thanks. I'll see you later. Bye. Ok, bye. - Metro Street Gym. Guest pass. Trainers. You look familiar. Jake Peters. Oh my God! Hey what's up? This is Chelsea, leave me a message and I'll get right back to you. - Chelsea, Chelsea. Hey can you call me as soon as you get this please. Yeah, I need to talk to you. Thanks. Chelsea. Your trainer is the same guy I saw in the park. I'm headed over now. He could be the stalker. Be careful. - Hey. - You woke me up. - Oh, sorry. I'm in the neighborhood. I wanted to drop off some supplements. Remember, I promised you a free bottle? It's my own formula. I have them made right here in L.A.. Your trainer is the same guy I saw in the park. He could be your stalker. Be careful! - Yeah, Jake. Thank you. I really appreciate that. Sara's about to come over right now and we're gonna get ready to go to school. But, thank you. Yeah. - Is everything all right Chelsea? - No, yeah. Everything's great. I just gotta get ready for school. Hey, one more thing. One sec. Oh! - She left me no choice. Where are you going? Looks like we're all going for a little ride. Yeah, I couldn't just leave her there, could I? She would have ruined our plans. - Are you okay? You're experiencing the hallucinogenic effects of the same flowers in your bouquet. Angel's trumpets. It'll pass. - Uh! - Home, sweet home. That wasn't so bad, was it? - You know I've been thinking and dreaming about this... ...since the first time I saw you. - I wanna get to know ...everything about you. - Please, just let us go! We won't say anything you've done to us. I swear! - Shh sh sh sh sh. I'll leave you alone. But, I'll be back. Hey, what's up? This is Chelsea. Leave me a message and I'll get right back to you. - Hey, it's me. Are you in the shower or something? I'm out front. - Hey, Eric. Is Chelsea not here? I don't know. I knocked on the door and I called her, but she's not picking up her phone. - That's strange. - Yeah. Her car is here. I was supposed to meet her and Sarah at the gym for a workout. Oh, It's unlocked. Chelsea, Eric's here. Chelsea? Chelsea? Honey? All of her stuff is here. I'm gonna go check the rest of the house. - Okay. - Chelsea? Well, her car is here, house keys. She never goes anywhere without her cell. It's strange Dean. I'm worried. - I wouldn't panic, honey, I mean, she's probably just out with friends. Check her social media pages, see if maybe she posted something. I'm almost wrapping up this job and I'll head over as soon as I'm done, okay? Thank you, honey. - Okay. - I'll see you soon. - All right, bye. - Hi Sarah, this is Eric and Chelsea's mom. We can't seem to find Chelsea, so when you get this message, if you can call one of us back, that'd be great! Thanks. - Thanks, Eric. I hate to do this, but I think I'm gonna call Mila. - Hi, Beverly. No, she's not. What's going on? - We don't know. I'm at the house with her boyfriend Eric. - Okay, no, I haven't seen her today. - Mila, Chelsea left behind her keys, her phone, and her car is still here. - That's strange. I hope this doesn't have to do with her stalker. - Her what? - Yeah, she had some guy from online following her. He was watching her the other day at the park when they were filming there. He even left flowers on her car. - Mila, did he threaten her in any way? - He said that if she went to the police, she'd be sorry. - Well we need to go to the police. - Mrs. Bilson, there's something else you should know. - What is it this time, Mila? Okay, I deserve that. It's just that, this could be serious, and I really hope it's not. But, there was this one night where she was really upset about a boyfriend breakup up, and she was broke and she couldn't finish her film. So, I was just trying to help. - What'd you do, Mila? - I created a webcam channel for her. - A what? - I just was setting her up to make some extra money online. It's called Dahlia's Dream World. I'm sorry, Mrs. Bilson. - There! Hello? Is anybody here? Please. Sara! Sara are you here? - I'm here, Chelsea. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Help! - Keep your voices down! - No, No, Aah! - You need to shut up. Today is not your lucky day. Wrong place, wrong time. Hey, it's Liam. Do your thing. - Liam, where are you? And why haven't you answered any of my texts? Did you find anything else about this guy's account? You should know that Chelsea's missing, so be careful this guy could be trouble. Call me back when you get this. - Unfortunately, I've seen this story before with the guy crossing the line into obsession. - What do you mean? - Well, sometimes they figure out how to track the girl down and then, who knows how far they'll take it? - Oh my God. - Now don't get me wrong, sometimes it's nothing. They're harmless. - But sometimes they're dangerous, right? - We need to deal with what we know. Have you seen her private web channel? - We were able to log into the website, but her channel has been deleted already. Do you think maybe you could get the site operator to give us information? - Legally, we can't. Chelsea's an adult, so no crime has been committed. The only way we can get more information is from the person who created it. - That's Mila. - And who's she? - Mila Walters. She's Chelsea's friend from high school. They reconnected a few weeks ago and she's the one who set up a web channel. - Okay great. I'm gonna need her number. Is there anyone else she may have met recently? - The movie. Her movie. Ah, maybe some new crew or extras? - What about that gym that you guys joined? - Yeah, the Metro Street Gym. The trainer's name is Jake Peters. We joined that. - Great. And you said that there was no sign of struggle in the house. Well, that tells me that she may have gone with someone that she knows. You said that she's been gone since 8:00 a.m. this morning? - That was the last time I saw her. - I know you didn't love your boyfriend. After all, he can't give you what I can. So I had to take care of him. No, no! - No, sweetheart, no. I promise, it was painless for him. Don't worry. I didn't let him suffer. Hey, it's Liam. Do your thing. - Of course! In 300 feet, turn right. You have reached your destination. I wasn't sleeping. - It's all my fault, Dean. I pushed her too hard. Oh, it's all my fault. - You know that's not true. - And look what happened. She had to go online and do all those terrible things for money. I can't even imagine my baby girl doing that. I couldn't even protect her. - You can not blame yourself for this. Honey, listen to me. You have raised a loving, kind, and thoughtful daughter. All right? Who's turned into a beautiful, intelligent, creative, young woman, and she's who she is because you are who you are. Don't you ever forget that. We're gonna find her. Oh Liam, oh Liam. - Detective? Could I have a moment with Liam, alone? - Go ahead. - Thanks. - You done? - Yeah, thanks. - Miss Walters, a lot of bad things are happening to your friends and I can't help but think that you're somehow involved. - What? I didn't have anything to do with this or with Chelsea. - Why don't you come down to the office so I can ask you some questions. - Am I being charged with a crime? - No. Not yet. But, it would be in your best interest to comply. - I have a few errands to run this morning and then I'll come by after. Good enough? - Yup. See you there. - Detective? One more thing. - What is it? - This is Liam's phone. I used his thumb to open it and, this name and address was the first thing that came up. Do you know him? - Now you're tampering with evidence, and yes I do. - Are you awake, my angel? I wanna pamper you. I hope you're hungry. There. Now, I know that you're still accepting the loss of your boyfriend, but I know if you just let me in, you'll see how much I love you. I'm gonna trust you not to scream, okay? Yes? - You gotta stop with the tea. It's making me so sick. I'm nauseous, and my head is spinning. - Okay, but we've gotta trust each other for this to work. I know in time that you'll come to love me too. You're a murderer. You're sick, and you need help! - I wish you wouldn't say things like that. - No. Please, don't. - I'm gonna give you some time to rethink your feelings. I've gotta go to the gym and pick some things up. I'll be right back. I'm gonna leave the TV on for you. Don't forget. I'm always watching. - Yeah? Jake, there's a Detective Morita here from the LAPD to see you. - Send him in. - Hey. - Mr. Peters, Detective Morita, LAPD. You got a few minutes to answer some questions? - Sure. Please, have a seat. What's this about? - One of your new clients is Chelsea Bilson, she's missing. So we're asking everybody that's seen her in the last few days if they remember anything strange. - That's terrible. I ran into Chelsea at the Roosevelt Park Coffeehouse, yesterday. She said that she was waiting for her boyfriend. We spoke for a few minutes and then I left. - And what were you doing at the park? - I was meeting a client for a work out. - What was that client's name? - Chris Fields. We have breaking news from downtown Los Angeles. Early this morning a man's dead body was found in the dumpster behind me. He's been identified as 21 year old Liam Gregg of Los Angeles. A family spokesperson said they are devastated by the tragic news and are at a loss as to who would do this to such a well liked young man. Police have no suspects at this time and they need the public's help. If you have any information, please call the LAPD Central Division and you can remain anonymous. Back to you in the studio. - And you've never contacted Chelsea online or sent her any flowers? No. No, I trained Chelsea twice here at the gym with her mother, Beverly. - Have you ever visited a website called Dahlia's Dream World? - Never heard of it. - It's a live webcam channel where men watch women. Losers. No, it's it's not my thing, Detective. Can we pick this up another time, actually? I've got some clients that I need to get to. - Oh no that's, that's it for now. Great. - But, I appreciate your time Mr. Peters. - Of course. - If I have any other questions, can I contact you? - Yeah. Yeah, please do. - Thank you. - Take care. Thanks for coming by. Yeah, thank you. - Detective? Something you forgot? - Yes, one more question. Do you, know a, Liam Gregg? - Can't say that I do. - He was found dead this morning in a dumpster, and your name and address were the first thing we found on his phone. - Oh, that's too bad. No. I mean a lot of people have my name and my number. I give out a lot of free memberships to people that I don't even know. It's just part of the business I'm in, so. - Thank you for your time. And we'll contact you if we need you. - Awesome. Thanks. You're a murderer. Jake, where are you? You're sick. I need your help getting down the stairs. He was found dead in a dumpster. You need help. - Sara! Sara. Wake up! Sara. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get us help. Help! Oh no! Easy, easy! Okay, so I got the guys at work are gonna take all of these and put them in the trucks. - I'm gonna go to the cafe and the school first and start there. Oh, the Detective. Hi, Detective. Hi Mrs. Bilson. Yes, I interviewed Jake at the gym and he says he doesn't know anything about what happened. But, here's the interesting thing. I ran his name through the national criminal database and he's been a busy guy. Yeah, he was arrested twice for battery, served six months for domestic violence, and has a restraining order. Then a year ago he was released from a mental institution to the care of his mother. Then his mother died, shortly after. She fell down the stairs of their house and broke her neck. Terrible accident, I'd say. - Wow. I just never would have expected. That's really disturbing. So what do you think? Does it put us anywhere closer to finding Chelsea? - I'm afraid it doesn't. I don't have the evidence to prove that he's involved. But, I'll keep looking. - What about the website? - We're still trying to get the owners to cooperate. They're being difficult about giving us access. I'm pushing the judge to give us a warrant. - Thank you, Detective. - Stop moving. Not a sound. Yeah? - Oh, hey, hey Jake, it's Bill, your neighbor. I wanted to return your mom's lawnmower. - Hey now's a really bad time. Any chance you could drop by later? Drop it off? - I can't, Jake, I've gotta drop it off now. I'm heading out of town later tonight. It's in the back of my truck. I need need your help. I'm really sorry. - Not a sound. Sure, Bill. I'll be right out. I'll be right back. Hah! Looks like it's time to go. It's the end of the road for you. Like I said. Wrong place, wrong time. Eek! This one's for you, Mom! Thank you. - What is that? Hmm. Fitness Life Nutrition. Jake Peters, Metro Street Gym. Sued by investors? Hey, Beverly. - Hi, do you have anything? - I found this protein label and, and get this. It comes from Fitness Life Nutrition. I found out that Jake Peters actually runs that company. - Uh huh? - Apparently he went bankrupt like two months ago, and now all of his investors are trying to sue him for fraud and embezzlement. - Interesting. Wow. This guy is a nightmare. The detective interviewed him too. I'll tell her about this, but could you just stay there in case she calls or comes home, and just call us if you have any other news, okay? - Yeah, thing is though, his warehouse is downtown. So, I got this idea that. Hello? Bev, hel. Any news? - I don't know. Something about Jake's company going out of business a couple of months ago. This guy's starting to look really guilty. Which, we need to find something concrete or we're not gonna find her. Oh it's Mila. Hey, Mila. Anything new? - Hi Mrs. Bilson. Yeah, my friend Liam, he was tracking that website guy, twoplates40. - Yeah. Yeah, what did he find? - I'm not really sure. Liam was found dead this morning. - Oh my God. Are you okay? That's horrible. - I'm okay, thanks. But, when I opened his phone, I found the contact info for what I think may have been the guy from the website. It's some guy named Jake Peters. I gave it to Detective Morita and she said she'd follow up with him. - Jake Peters? Wait, she didn't say anything about Jake being on the website. - Oh, she doesn't know that it's for sure him, but Liam had been hacking the website and matching up the usernames with credit card info. All I know is that when I opened his phone this morning, I saw the address and the name of that guy. I can't be sure he's the one. - Would you please text me that address? Thank you, Mila. And I am so sorry about your friend. It's him! Who? - Jake was the one on line. I know it! The gym guy? - Yes, the gym guy. She's texting me the address. Okay, here we go. Turn around. - You don't see that I'm the only one who really cares for you. I will never let you down like the others. I'll take care of you. You're gonna love the life that I give to you. You're gonna love me. Hello? Chelsea? Chelsea, it's Mom. Are you in there? Help! Help me! - Did you hear something? - Help! - I did. Help! - Let's go around the back. - Help! - Oh my God! Oh my God! - Oh my God! Sara! It's open. Sara! I'll check that rest of the house. - Sweetheart, are you okay? - My head just really hurts. - What happened? - He sprayed me with something. It knocked me out. It's disgusting. - Is Chelsea here? - I don't know, I don't, Chelsea was, Chelsea was here. - There's no one here now. Who's this? - I don't know. I was knocked out. - My God, this guy's dead. - We have to call the police, and we have to get you to the hospital. Okay, thanks. - Oh, Eric texted. He's gonna Jake's warehouse and he sent the address. We should go. We can call the police on the way. Are you okay? - Yeah, Im fine. I'm, I'll be fine. I'm feeling better, I just, I wanna get away from here. - Of course. Come on. Do I turn up here, honey? - Yeah. Your second left. Ok. - You okay? Okay, take it easy love. Five minutes. Okay. - Help! Someone help me please! - Help me! Sweetheart, there's nobody here. It's just you and me. - Please! Somebody! - Listen, don't be upset. We'll be out of here soon. You can rest on the way to the cabin. Alright? We're gonna have a great life together. You'll see. We can live off the grid. Make our own little secret garden. Stay inside. Lock the doors. Alright, the ambulance is on its way. - This could be his truck. That's Chelsea's slipper. - The engine's still warm. Alright, they haven't been here long. That door's locked. Let's check around back. - It's gonna be dark soon. I'm calling the detective. - Mrs. Bilson? - Hello, detective? Hi. - I'm sorry you're breaking up. - Wait, hello? I think we have a bad connection. - No, say that again. You're, ah. - Well, we think we found Chelsea and she's with Jake. I'm gonna text you the address. I hope you can hear this. - What? - Oh, God! Anything? Here, help me with this. I think we can get it. Wha? We have a hostage situation. Alright.ll lift. - I'm trying. Okay. Ah! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. - Oh my God! Where did you come from? - I was upstairs. I was able to pry this off and get the door open. - Don't do anything that's gonna make me hurt you. - I came through this tunnel and looked inside, but I didn't really see anything. Looks pretty empty to me. - It's a lot of space. I think we should split up. - Yeah, we have to be careful, this guy is dangerous. - I'm gonna see if I can find the breaker box. I think if I could shut the power off I might be able to flush Jake out. - We can go this way, to see if there's any sign of Chelsea. - Okay then, I'm gonna go with Eric, and you, if you see him just stay hidden. Okay, we just gotta make sure she's okay. - Right. - Be careful. - Be safe. - Okay, wait here. Wait here. - No Eric, stop. Ah! - Eric. Eric! Mom! Mom, I'm in here! - Chelsea! - Mom! - Chelsea, Chelsea! Don't move! - Okay. Okay, I stopped. Just don't hurt her. - Hurt her? I don't wanna hurt her. You're making me hurt her. All of this is happening because of your mother. We were gonna have a life together. You've ruined everything! - Jake, you don't have to do this. - But, I do. I'm not goin' back. The torture. And the drugs. And their talk. The voices never stop when I'm in there! - Mom, stop. Be careful! - Chelsea, it's gonna be okay. - Why, huh? Why is is gonna be okay? Because mommy's gonna save her? - Jake, listen to me. - You're a horrible mother! You're coldhearted, and you're loveless, and you're cruel. How could a mother be so cruel to her son? - Jake, don't you mean daughter? - I know what I said. I'm not gonna let you stand in the way of my happiness. I'm not. You're gonna see. Everybody's gonna see, that love is the answer. Okay, you just don't understand like we do. Okay. Right, right? We understand, right Chelsea? - Jake, let's talk this through then. Let's just talk this through. You love her, right? You don't wanna hurt her. You don't want to hurt anyone, right? - I want you to apologize, for being a, for being a bad mother. - Apologize? - I want you to apologize now! Apologize or I'll hurt her, and it'll be all your fault! - Okay, okay. I will right now. I'm sorry, Chelsea, I am so sorry for not being a good mom. - Keep going. Say the words! - Chelsea, I mean it when I say that it's not your fault. If I had done better you wouldn't be in this situation. You would be safe at home. No, keep going! - It's my fault. You deserve better. And I'm really sorry that I put you in a position like this. I'm sorry that I pushed you into something that you didn't want to do. - Mom, stop! - And Jake, if you want to hurt someone, hurt me, not Chelsea. I deserve it, and not her. - You're right. You're right, you do deserve it. She's perfect and it's your fault. - Aah! - Aah! Chelsea! - Aah! - Ow! Mom! Run, oh my God! - Oh my God! Gah! - Are you okay? Oh God. Are you okay? That's good. So, I'm so happy that things are good with Eric! - Yeah, me too. I mean, it took a long time, but I'm finally not so on edge. - Good, because you can't control what happened. Yeah, I'm starting to realize that. - What we need to do is focus on our studies, and get our degrees. You mean, my studies and my degree? - No, I mean we. - Mom, you're going back to college? - I'm going back to finish my degree. - You're serious? - Yeah. 'Cause you know I thought we could hang out, do the college thing together. - Oh my gosh. Did you join a sorority? Very funny. - Well, I'm proud of you. - Hey, actually I'll tutor you. You just have to pay me. - Oh really? Maybe you're gonna be the one that has to keep up with me!
