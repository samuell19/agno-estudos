Ghost...ghost....ghost... To help students study without any fear, I've told them they slipped and fell down from top floor. People run away fearing ghosts but ghosts run in fear on seeing me. You're not helping me but education. Wait here, I'll come with ghost, we can take selfie with it, doctor. Is this B block? I'll never open it. Long live ghost! Till there are people ready to get cheated, this cheating ghost buster will cheat them. I'll take hefty fee, have drinks and take rest. Why the drum is circling? Ice boys....find who am I? Real ghost is here... Don't come here, I'll arrest you in this. Come... I'll be fearless only after I have drinks. Allow me to drink! I'll not chase away ghosts but kill it. They finished me - What happened? I've arrested all the rogue ghosts in this vessel. Indeed you've proved to be best ghost buster Peyandi. What proven? Only I know the pain I had been through! It'll calm down only if I hit nail on head at midnight in a burial ground. Though it troubled me, don't trouble it, give it a decent burial. Indeed you're a great man who is feeling for ghosts too! Please pay my fee, sir. Bhaskar, pay his fees. Sir, award a doctorate also to him. We've chased out ghosts, can we open B block now? We got into trouble for opening B block in haste. Let's open it on another auspicious day. Mother, 25 packs of biryani! What? Did you bring 25 biryanis? - Yes. I sent you an SMS, didn't you read it? I got your message but I didn't read what it was. I sent you to buy 3 biryanis. Your mother then told me it was no moon day, so I sent message cancelling the order. Didn't you read any message? I got it, you didn't know to read. You would've shown it to the shopkeeper. Hubby, come, let's offer prayers. I'll come little later, first inquire your son. What's it, son? Mother, it seems he sent some SMS... Why send SMS to son? Why didn't you call him on phone? You know why I send message instead of calling him, if he reads and understands messages, his knowledge of British English will improve. Idiot! - Don't talk like that. My son has passed Plus 2 with good marks. Does he look like a plus 2 student? - Why not? He's not smart enough as you think. He's all brawn not brain at all! Don't cast evil eye on my son. I'm not, give those biryanis to beggars. Serve it to father, mom. Serve sweets along with biryani, sir. How come a dead body is here in whites! Who are you? I helped your son to pass plus 2. I've confirmed seat for your son in MRM Medical College. Thank God, my son is a doctor. He'll be a doctor. ,Where shall I open a clinic, mother? That is... - In Kannammapet burial ground? Don't talk inauspiciously - Okay, I'll talk auspiciously. The patients your son kills on operation table, I can bury them without spending for ambulance. The moment my son enters college, you'll get your money. Go home. You're talking about giving bribe before a police man. Won't people malign me for this? If they give anything, take it and have it. Come son, let's have milk pudding. Should I eat if they malign me? What? We studied together from class one and today we're in medical college. I've joined college by paying hefty bribe. Let's take a selfie of this historic occasion and post it on Facebook. Take snap - Give a pose. What a face! Is it face? Looks like a sick hen! You jealousy man! Look at body's shape! Looks like a shape less hot dog! Am I like sick hen? Am I shape less hot dog? How dare you say I don't have good shape? She herself says she has great body! You don't know about me. Do you know about me? If I see you laugh again, I'll break your teeth. Break teeth? - Get lost, girl. We're taking a selfie, why is she getting angry? Do you know what first lesson of MBBS is? - What's it? Don't take selfies, come. Though not good in studies, I'm the first to enter the classroom. Who is that drying hair in class room? We come to college to have great time. Shall we study? Ghost...ghost... - Stop! Ghost? Where's the ghost? You called me a ghost, right? I didn't call you a ghost, I saw a ghost and called it ghost. I've been curling my hair for 6 months. Look at my eye brows, I've had threading. My cheeks are like apples, I've use rose powder also. I've had golden facial in parlor for bright face. Used lip gloss to cover lip stick. I've a fit and great body. How dare you call me a ghost! Isn't it latest fad to use ghost make up? Professor walked in to save us Come. Go....get in... Why are you like ghost beaten? Please don't talk about it, madam. If you sit with frowning face on day one, I can't concentrate in my class. Madam too called her ghost. God can't be everywhere, so he created doctors. People consider doctors as Gods. She's very beautiful today! In make even old woman look beautiful! Buddy.. - What? I must pick her up at any cost. You want to go on honeymoon as fresher in college. How can you think like that? One who has teeth will eat nuts, one who has camera will take selfies. Why you are jealous, man? You decided to go on honeymoon, right? I've a doubt - What? Tell me correctly, if man dies, he becomes ghost. Do rats and frogs come back as ghosts? Why do you get such doubts? Fearing rat my come back as ghost, I left it without dissecting it. You're so scared for this, how can you enter mortuary then? Mortuary? There are dead bodies inside, I'll not come. If you want to become a doctor, you must come to the mortuary. Come. Come. - What? My parents tried a lot and failed to get rid me of this fear. I'll not come to class, you manage it. This is anatomy class, don't miss it. Oh no, I'll not attend this class - Please listen to me. Attend class, please. Are you sitting here? I'm coming. Why are you sitting here bunking anatomy class? Medical college is not my choice I'm damn scared. I want to quit medicine and join teacher training. Why are you taking drastic decision for this silly thing? I've very good medicine for your fear May I?- What's it? If you take the medicine after fulfilling 48 day vow. 0You can do 100 post mortems in one day. Where can I get that medicine? It's in the prayer hall of my house. If you come to my house at midnight. I'll make you sit in the hall and give you a bath. If you take bath and offer prayers in the hall. You'll get blessed. Would lose my fear if I take medicine? Now, you're coming into my track. He's right. I'm not coming. Come, man! - Coming, boss. Did you see, boss? Bribes are standing as teak pillars. Wow!

Boss, she's also here to rob like us. Boss, food smell is mouth watering. Let's eat first and then go for the kill. What's this, mother? You look just like Nithya. What? Why did you come here? You promised to give medicine for fear. You switched off phone and sleeping like log. I did promise medicine... did you believe it and come here? I jumped over such a big gate... no medicine? Medicine is there...sit here. Serve... I'll serve copiously, have a go at food, boss. Close your eyes, I'll give medicine. Hey girl, I'm flying high because of you.... Just a look and I'm floating in air... You're chewing me with your pearl like teeth.... When I ask you to let me go, you're giving me a stare... You're sweet like sugar... You're dismantling me in parts... Is it a boon or new found happiness? Hey boy, you're breaking me into pieces like glass... How come you're merging into my heart like poison... You're chasing me... You're chasing me with your eyes... You're after me like hell... You're frying me up... You've entered like a rat in a food basket... You're a tiger in stealing... It'll not end with a hug.... Love will not end on bed... You're stealing me... You're burying me in your dimple... You're threatening me... You're taking my life... You're hovering over me and attacking my heart with sword.... I fear you but you're in my heart... Who are they? Why are you shooting after hands up? - You? What I want to tell.. - Get me the cook, go. Any doubt with leg piece? I doubt biryani not in chicken piece. I swear on God, this is biryani. You want to swear on food plate, are you really a biryani cook? Am I tamarind rice cook then? Do you know about my family? Was your grandpa Health Inspector? No, my father is health inspector I'll lock your hotel. Boss! Please don't create problem. Your father took bribe and 10 packets of free biryani yesterday. Will you leave the place or shall I post your photo in Facebook? Some Arnold will come to seek justice from you on our behalf! One minute, sir. - What? Do whatever you want with me, sir. But don't you dare touch my skinhead boss! Is he your boss? He looks like a burnt frying pan! - People are watching, sir. Not just people here, I'll make sure this nation watches it on TV. Why show us on TV? Today you made biryani with kittens, what if you kidnap infants for it? Show us then. - I'll show. I sent you to jail, are you out on bail to loot my home? We'll get back things where we lost it, right? What did you lose in my kitchen? - Licked sambar. Fantastic! Never in my life tasted such delicious food. You've engaged a very good cook. I mean as maid. - I'm not cook, I'm his wife. Are you his wife? Are you his wife? Sister, we lost our livelihood because of him. We were very hungry, we were eating food prepared by you, sister. Suddenly he started firing with gun, sister. Do you know how happy I'm when you call me as sister, brother? You're calling robbers as brothers. Don't you feel ashamed of it? They lost their livelihood because of you. It's our duty to feed them, right? He appears like my dead brother. Don't worry, stay here and eat happily, brother. Why are you tensed, mother? - Nothing...did your exams well? Very tasty! What are you doing here, skinhead? Don't talk to me indecently. Are you making fun with serious face? My face is like that. Get out! Sister, you've insulted me after serving chicken. Bye. Please stop, brother....please... - Sister's affection is stopping me. Arjun, I've taken him as guest for your exams. Are you officer? Tell him and get me also pass... What? - He's not officer but thief. Why not call him a bloody thief? I'm feeding him to open the lock of the room which stores answer papers. I'm a doctor of locks! All colleges are built over lakes. - But this is built on burial ground. They asked me also to study MBBS. - Shut up and be on job. Shut my mouth! Why are you shouting? Skull! - Whose skull it is? Hallucination! Let's go now and come back tomorrow morning. Let's go. - Don't do it. Bravely entered the college building. Why grill uncooked chicken? You're talking in rhyme at midnight. I'll show you demo, look here! - Demo? Did you see secret of my profession? Head full of brain! 0I'll show you my expertise. Catch him. Just now I said you're brainy. This is the room. Here it is! Our lives are locked in here. - Yes, skinhead boss. This is 'Anbe Vaa' lock. When I show keys, it'll select the key. Did you see? Love has started! Great skinhead boss! Gopal....open up, Gopal... Am I conducting party meeting here to applaud? You're applauding forgetting about answer papers. Answer papers are in this room. Useless lock! Did you bring text books to copy? Book...? - I didn't bring any. I do have it. Come. You'll take 3 hours to write. I can finish it in 45 minutes if I copy from text book. Do something. This is the safest place. We're just two here. You kept another large glass here. Why did you keep such a big glass? We don't have that much liquor. I didn't keep it here. You've started blabbering before drinking. One can have blood in body not BP. It'll make you go bonkers! Shall I serve? - Looks like there's something here. Don't drink....boy...don't drink... You can sing on stage, brother. - You think so? Who finished it? Liquor vanished. Did you finish it so quickly? No. It's wrong to drink at this age. - Okay. Drinking like a ghost is worse. - It wasn't me. Just hallucination! Ice boys....find who am I? That's it! How dare to enter this place! We too don't have permission to enter this room, how could you enter? Someone has planned to change my answer sheet to fail me, madam. Look at this, just blank papers, madam. Who changed it? - That was... I've to find it. - Come out. He's acting, madam. Why are you playing with ghosts? He's the guy! Leave me. - He changed the papers. Get beaten up, I'll buy you biryani. Why are you trapping me? - He has been caught, come, madam. Leave me. - He's the thief. Where are the stolen papers? Basically I'm from a good family, madam. Look here, madam! Why good men have to keep so many keys? Ask him, madam. Why is he over doing the scene? Close the gate. Madam, I've watched blue films but never copied in exams. Are you talking about blue films with me? You've an interview with professor tomorrow, if you answer his questions correctly. You can continue in this college. If not management will take severe action against you. Tell me, madam. - 00Let these two boys stay here. Hand him over to police. - Police? Even at furious mood! You managed it beautifully and coolly. Like cotton candy... Brother... - What? You got paid, right? Get going. Don't get me fired, brother. Do you've diabetes? - Yes. But still you can munch it. Leave the place quickly. Did you go there for drinks or fight over it? Ghosts hit us before we opened the bottle. I got caught because of you. I'll not get my MBBS degree. Phone call? Your phone? Mother! - Help line? Use it. Tell me, mother. Why your voice appears tired? Have plenty of water, son. Only then you won't feel sleepy and get energy to copy. I had full drinks. You had hot water, right? He would've had drinks and thrown up. Your father is still awake. You got your paper, right? - No, I'm caught, mother. What's this, son? It seems there's a special inquiry tomorrow. Why inquiry? A boy is unable to write exam in day time. He's copying from books at night, what's wrong in it? You can understand it, mother. - Tomorrow I'll come there. You don't worry, son. Okay. Mother. - What's it, son? He'll tell if he knows, he doesn't know it, right? You can't save him at any cost now. Meet him in Puzhal jail, mother. Where are you two guys? There are only fake doctors. What? You can befriend them. You ruined my plan getting drunk and tell my mother that I'll go to jail. I'll kill you and go to jail. But still you'll go to Puzhal jail only. I'm right, okay? Careful! Madam! Leave me.... - Madam... Stop there! Don't you know entry is banned at odd hours? You'll die, go away. Who are you? Shall I call security? I said you will die! Aunty, professors are here, talk to them. You're the inquiry officer, right? Before asking questions, give this to him in little quantities. I've made right mix for him. You're giving drinks to student, don't you've sense? What did you say? He's my son. This is Vallarai juice, he refuses to take it so I mixed it with soft drinks. Are you here as professors without knowing this? I don't believe you. Looking at your dress and jewels, I feel you're wedding guests. Show me Aadhar and ration cards. Show me your certificates. I don't believe them, right? Who is she? - She's mother of that boy. Yes. Do we look like wedding guests? It's your son inside, right? I'll send him our after serving feast, present wedding gift and take him home. Till then have this juice and wait here with energy. Did I go overboard in haste? - Too much! You're still sitting, won't you show respect? Shows no respect at all. Do you know what the complaint on you is? Without writing exam, you gave blank sheets. You entered stealthily at night to fill it up. Following new technique to copy. We didn't think so, sir. What's the full form of MBBS, Arjun? Fall at her feet saying, you don't know the answer. He's not answering any question. I suspect he changed the papers. Please sit down, I'll finish this inquiry. Do you know the answer or not? I'm sure it's him. Sir, you're Professor of Physiology, she's Bio-Chemistry professor, She's Professor of Pathology and he's professor of Human anatomy. Why is he here? - Chair is empty, right? He came to meet me. Why is he in inquiry? Wait in my cabin. You're too much! How well you manage them! Will you answer now? Tell me! How can he answer? So, you studied last night and I had drinks. You misunderstood a brilliant student, sir. Aunty, your answered question brilliantly. - My son? No way! How could he answer without having Vallarai juice? Like mother like son, very smart! What do you say? His head will reel now for my next question. Leave me! Who pinched my waist now? Not me. - It was me, madam. I don't know why I did like that! Behave like a professor not like a rogue. You must remember only this! I don't remember anything. Stop please! What's your problem with me? Why did you ask me to go out? Veeraiah! Sir! Where are you boys? Sir, he'll come. I'm living with the hope that you'll come back, sir. Sir! Your hope isn't belied. How much trouble you took for me, sir! Don't spare anyone, sir! Kill every one of them, sir! Leave them, boys! Come on, boys! Today is death day for all of you! Who are you, man? Are you student or sorcerer? He's asking you a question, right? Who the hell that is? Tell me, Bhaskar. - Ghost is back, doctor. What? It has killed everyone, only I managed to escape. Don't harm me....save me... What's happening there, Bhaskar? Don't harm me, please... Tell me.... - I'll not tell. Won't you tell me? I'll not tell. How did you enter this girl's body? Tell me! I'll not tell! Samy, we visited every temple and met every God man. You must save our daughter, sir. Tell me. Move! Tell me! I'm Brahmeshwari asking you! Leave this body. - No way. Give me amulet. - Take it, Guru! Tell me. Who are you? I'm Muthu who hanged himself to death... Brahmeshwari is warning you, leave the body. If not... Come, RK. You built college in burial ground, is college like cremation ground? I opened B block without caring about your warning. 4 of my men died. I tried to contact you but couldn't. Your disciple told me he had arrested the ghost. I did catch it but don't know how it managed to escape. What to do now? Bury this ghost and hit a nail on it. - Go...go... You're fine now, go. If I arrest a ghost it can never escape from it. I'm not human soul to get arrested by you, I'm soul of Satan! I know how it managed to reach your place. I'll arrest it. Try to catch me if you can! Making coffee for whom? For me? If I make coffee for you, ' you'll die with high BP. This is for my son. You always said he's useless son, what's this sudden love for him? What to do? I was careless till now. I realized today that I've a son who is like Bill Gates. So, I'll serve a good coffee and make amendments with my son. After achieving so much, he's sitting silently as if nothing had happened. Son, I heard about it. It seems Professors went crazy with your answers in inquiry. I'm ashamed of scolding you all these days, son. Go, man! Why are you angry on me, son? Get out, man! This is too much! You have your coffee, I'll go. Already had it. Had it...? What's this? Coffee cup is in my hand. His mouth is there! Mouth-Fi like Wi-Fi? He was born to achieve great things, he would've done it. Thanks son. If he sucks up river Cauvery water like this, it'll of great help to Tamil Nadu. Doctor...save me.... - Doctor, my body is burning, sir. I'm dying with pain, sir. Someone is calling. Can we meet them? Don't turn back. Evil souls are calling you. They're calling you in different voices. If you turn back to see, you're dead. Brahmeshwari! Look here! I thought her body would've decomposed and become mud. But the evil soul managed to escape. Blood is still warm, did you see it? Cheers, boss! We're getting kicked, why is he huffing and puffing? Piss? Wetted your pant? - No... What's the gesture? Let's escape before they start thrashing us, boss. I'll cut you! We'll take bath and come with amulet. Wait till then. We must find which body this evil soul has entered. Are you searching me? All of you would die! I'll find it. I've been observing you, of late you're behaving differently. What's your problem? Goddess Kali, come! This blessed lemon will find the evil soul. It seems you're not answering her phone calls. She's pestering me with questions. What am I to tell her? Get anyone who faces you! Go! - I'll go, you inform her and go. Did you talk to him? - Talk to him yourself. Are you angry on me? Do you feel is it cheap if a girl falls in love with a boy? Or else will you like only if I make you after me and then say I love you? Answer me, Arjun! If you poke your nose in my matters unnecessarily, you will die. Arjun, I'm talking to you... I've told you, right? Son! Why are you going to college with baggage? Cultural programs in college and exams are also coming. I'm going to stay in hostel for studies. Hubby, please come here. - Tell me. What? Our son wants to stay in hostel for studies. Let him study. His thirst for knowledge is moving at jet speed. Why are you putting speed breakers to slow him down? He flattered professors with h is profound knowledge. He'll achieve something great to make this nation turn back to see him. Let him do it but let him stay with us, we've only one son. You pampered and spoilt our son. He needs little privacy. Only then he can dedicate himself and achieve great things. Can't he do it staying in home? Whatever you do is wrong and whatever he does is right! You carry on, son. Look at him, he has a dot on forehead, wears anklets, he's putting on my slippers. He said about cultural competition in college, right? I think he'll dance there. Started rehearsal from home. - Is it? Good morning, brother. - How is it? Your costume is excellent. But when you walk, I could hear sound of anklets... ...that was also excellent. Eat well, keep fit body. Though he's possessed by ghost, he has great affection for us. Let's have lunch, come. He's telling us symbolically to eat well and keep fit for getting thrashed. Without knowing this... Who are you guys? You appear like wild hogs! Not hogs but Porcupines! Hasn't your soul blessed with peace? I'm still a virgin. Anyone may tell lies but not this blessed lemon. Stop it. I'm also telling them same thing, sister with locks of hair. No evil soul can escape from me. You? No! Bring him down. That's what I was saying for an hour. Since I√≠m medical college student, I'm saved from paying fee. Had it been someone else, they would've spent money like hell. Think about expenses before thrashing someone. Is it nice? Come on, boys! Don't you've sense to watch a girl applying make-up? Is the ghost inside you? Have you found it? - Yes. Come. - Why? Come I say! 4 plus 4 is 8... You and I am a couple... If you touch me, I'll apply dot... Shall I apply dot on forehead? Come on I say! Are you here to destroy me? - No. I'll apply dot! Anyone else is here? Anyone here? Come out! Hail Goddess Kali! Don't allow anyone inside till prayers are over. Tell me, sir. How come you appear before me suddenly? Brahmeshwari ordered us to follow bodies with evil souls. We'll find and destroy it. Now, I'm at peace. Wear this. What's this? It fell down. Evil souls don't have necks! Evil soul, stop! He killed your men and turned them into evil souls to go against you. What a terrible evil soul he could be! He's studying bigger book than mine. Why are you studying third year book? Yes. - Yes? Hail Goddess Kali! Are you possessed by any evil soul? Hail Goddess Kali! Don't stop chanting holy hymns! Dared to take on me! I'll reduce your body to ashes! Hail Goddess Kali! Hail Goddess Kali! No! Hail Goddess Kali! Leave me! Hail Goddess Kali! What happened to you, Arjun? - Leave me! Hail Goddess Kali! Stop! Hail Goddess Kali! Leave me... Leave me...I'll kill you... After years the evil soul's body is reduced to ashes. Evil soul will be in someone's body within your college campus. I've built a protective wall with my divine power. What to eat? Chicken or soup? Brother, please move the chicken. Sister, blood fry is missing. Delicious aroma of sambar is fantastic! I cooked everything. I'll get blood fry. Boss! - What? What's the first thing you get on seeing this? Can't you tell anything directly? Come straight. Doesn't it look like food offered to dead souls? To hell with your nasty mouth! He seems very hungry. Fishbone stuck in throat? Look there! Bad ghost! Boss, run faster! Why are you running out? Stomach upset! Why both at a time like twins? I think my cooking so good to get digested so quickly. Yes...yes... - Go...go... What's this, son? You're back in home in 2 days. Couldn't stay away from mother for long, right? Clashes in college, Dean was murdered. What? Clashes in college and dean got killed? Dean wouldn't have been killed by others, he alone would've killed him. Boss? - Yes. He would've asked question, he would've killed him in anger. Ghost is in good mood, before it comes back, let's have food. Keep an eye on ghost. Boss, he finished everything in a jiffy. Mother! '- Come! Did he say college is closed for Dean's death? Yes. - No, he didn't die, he's alive. He cut classes and telling everyone that Dean is dead. I think there's some problem with his head, mother. He's a boy but living like a girl. You won't believe if I tell. He looks eagerly at necklaces. He puts on nail polish. He looks sideways and talks in murmurs. Why is he carrying this sari? - This? This is my sari. Useless bugger! He took it as my remembrance. He's in hostel, right? Is it any big deal? Move. Move? - Come and have lunch. I'm telling you he turning into a girl, you're going away carelessly. I smell something really bad. This is not bad smell but my skinhead smell. I'm not Pavadai but Poonandi. Inner skirt. Titanic ship is walking majestically. If you're Rose, then I'm Jack. Why did you come here? I came to catch ghost. - Did you catch one? You caught me before that. - Won't you ever reform? If I reform, can I write Thirukkural? You! Love line is running fine on your palm. It is not wrong for me to fall in love with you. Even advises to guys like will go to deaf ears. I swear on you that I'll never again steal in my life. Bye, professor. Thief! You promised not to steal again but you stole something from me. Oh no! You're going to say chewing gum dialogue you stole my heart. I'll deliver a dialogue, would you like to hear it? You're sixteen, I'm eighteen. Shall we? Ring! This is also stolen. Are you my nightingale? My nightingale! Enamored...my heart is enamored... What? Some ghost is singing song here. That isn't ghost, I was singing song now. Are you dejected, my Prince? I'm scared, boss. - I'm not singing now. Can sky shrink ever? Can't...heart can't take it... Myna, take a card for Mohana. Why do you call a parrot as Myna? For the troubles you're facing, do you need to clear this doubt? What problems am I facing? You came here on your own will, I said let me ask about future. Okay, you can go. Madam, don't mistake me. I√≠ve named my parrot as Myna. Is it? Okay, come out. Why is it not picking card? You just recharged it, it wants you to top up for Rs.50. You've taught it so much for Rs.50. Okay, turn that side. That's my livelihood, madam. Take money. Come out, Myna. Pick as good card for my son. My son must finish MBBS and become a great doctor. See if the card has Goddess of learning? No problem if it is Goddess of Learning but this card has devil! Why the parrot is shivering? - Why are you scared, Myna? Is that your son, madam? My parrot is scared. - You scared it. Why are you looking around my house? Don't think of stealing my home a night. My husband is police Inspector, he'll gun you down. Do I look like a thief? I'm here to foretell future. My fearless Myna is scared on seeing your son. Something is wrong in this house. - Yes, hell. Madam, escape from here, there's evil spirit here. There's evil spirit in this house. - Take your mat. Give that to ghost. He calls parrot as Myna and tells there's ghost here. A man is on fast inside police station. He's not listening to any advice. Ask him, what's the reason? It seems Myna is missing, so he's fasting. For genuine love or illicit relationship, lodge a complaint, hit the man's back 15 times and send him away. Can you dare hit me? I'll transfer you to remote desert. Shut up. He has names parrot as Myna. It is no ordinary parrot. It can tell correctly PM's next foreign visit and when Mallya would return to India. It is multi talented politically astute parrot. I got a clue. Where was it last seen? Some damn lady called it to foretell future. No doubt. That lady's husband is responsible for missing parrot. He would've got parrot kidnapped using henchmen. If we find that rogue, we can find parrot. Then, you're the criminal, you must be arrested. Am I criminal? Should I be arrested? Yes. - What yes? I'm an Inspector who arrests criminals, how can I be criminal myself? Please listen patiently. When you left to office, an astrologer entered home. Seeing our son, parrot flew away in fear. Astrologer said there's an evil spirit in this house. Okay, get me some water. Ordinary water or ice water? Okay, I'll get it from fridge. Hot water in fridge? He's foolish. How can anyone get hot water from fridge? Hubby....hubby...come here... What happened? Why are you shouting like devil? Ghost...ghost.... Ghost inside fridge? - Yes. How can ghost be inside fridge? Don't go there. How can see ghost without going there? A cowardly wife for a brave man. Ghost doesn't know about police. Don't shout. You scared me, why are you standing away from me? Where's the head? I used my police power to get free fruits. Instead of giving juice for me, are you keeping it safely for your dad? If you talk about ghost, I'll kill you. Abracadabra! Go away. Bloody ghost! Come and change bed spread. Who is it? Who is crying? Hubby! Why are you looking at me indifferently? I'm already in bad mood, don't turn it worse. Remove your make up and sleep. Don't you dare touch me? How angry he is! I can hear voices. Who is crying? Whoever it may be, talk to me directly. Don't make noise without being seen. Hubby...please, get up. Someone please come here. Why are you howling like a fox? Are you scared on seeing me? When I moved bed spread to wake you up... A skeleton caught my hand. Do I look like a skeleton to you? I'm scared when you roll your eyes. I'll hit you. I'll divorce you without any reason. Switch off the light. Okay, you go to sleep. Don't stare at me. We'll sleep in different rooms from tomorrow. Ghost! Parrot was happily living in forest with its family. You caught it and taught few tricks to it. You made my wife to believe in ghosts. Come and tell my wife you lied to her. My parrot isn't scared of Tsunami but got scared on seeing your son. What does it mean? What it means? - There's ghost in your house. Should I believe if you say thrice? How do you or your parrot know there's ghost in my house? If you don't believe me, at midnight, draw a motif, light a lamp and keep a lemon in hall. If it spoils the motif and puts off the lamp. It means there√≠s ghost in your house. If not take any action you deem fit for me. I'll take you to task. Why are you bringing your face close to me? I'm scared on seeing your bulging eyes. I too got scared. Look, how beautiful the lemon is. Why ghosts are scared of this? It seems ghosts get stomach upset if they eat this. I'll prove there's no ghost in this house. Hey fool! Okay, keep this in hall. Ask me to cook with it, I'll do it. Cooks and ghosts don't jell well. - Why? When we cook, we get vapour, right? That's right. You keep this in hall. Brother is our guest. Guests and ghosts don't get along well. You're a police officer, you do it. Are you insulting brave man before these fools? I'll check inside, if there's no ghost, I'll bite your neck. I must be carrying gun but they're asking me to carry this. Where's the ghost? I'll hit ghost with slipper. Why are you scared? - No, I'm not. I'll make ghost run in fear of death. Don't kill it, may get charged for murder. I'll not file FIR against myself. Ghost, if you had entered this house without my permission. I request you to vacate the place immediately. Don't get scared, brother. He'll manage it well. If you're male ghost, go to Fig tree, if you're female ghost, go to tamarind tree. I don't believe it but still if you're hiding in my home, I'll encounter you without any evidence. I've lighted the lamp. Who is it? Who are you? You son! There's ghost in home, let's escape. Where did it go away? Will you encounter me? - Don't shout. Ghost may hear it. Do you think we'll get scared of law and order? Why are you talking like ghost? Not like ghost. - Then, who else? I'm ghost! Water....water... Still pending? - Yes. Continue with your job. Run! Ghost! Our son has been possessed by ghost. Is our son possessed by ghost? Is he telling truth? Hubby...hubby... Hubby! Hubby! Are you still here? Why are you coming in auto? I ran away in fear. I ran away 9 kms. 9 kms in 8 minutes! I was running, I felt someone was after me. When I turned back to see... - We were behind him. I was relieved. Are you really a police officer? I struggled so much to make my son a doctor. But he has become a ghost. Though I got thrashed like hell, I withstood everything. Why should we get thrashed? - You must. We must chase away the ghosts and save our Arjun. We'll thrash them. Let's enter house together. - Let's go. Why are you standing outside house like ghosts? When did you go out, son? When was I inside? I'm coming home now. Just now you punched on my face inside home. What is he saying? It seems today he arrested and thrashed a dreaded goon in station. He hit back and bloodied his face. When did I arrest a goon? Keep your tiffs later, I'm hungry, come and serve food, mother. Go son, I'll follow you. You don't sit on floor even while offering prayers. Today you're sitting on floor to have food in plate. Come and sit on table. - When did I eat in plate? Where's banana leaf? - Leaf? Spread it. - You do it, Mohana. Do it. - No, you do it. Leaf is torn. - Do it. Son! Where's Anjalai? Affection on aunt! Which aunt? - He wants Anjalai. I fired Anjalai 3 months ago because of you. Suspecting me, mother fired Anjalai from job 3 months ago. Where are 5 leaves? He wants 5 leaves. Bring it. - Bring it. I'm hungry! Come, let's eat. We're back! Why are you serving food? I've to serve food in leaf, right? We can't serve food without leaf, right? When did I eat food? - What else then? Millet porridge. - Don't use bad words. I'm hungry, get me millet balls. - Millet balls? I'll make it for you. My husband is police officer, look what he's doing now. He's preparing millet balls. What? Why ghost is asking for millet balls? May be ghost died with diabetes. Isn't there anyone to clear our doubt? Ghost took away everything. Ghost is missing.... Millet balls too are missing. God, protect us! Ice boys....find who am I? Fantastic millet balls! Why are you thrashing your father, son? Gods! Apart from ghosts from grandpa and grandma's stories, all other ghosts have entered my son's body. God, may the ghost that possesses my son leave him and go away to cremation ground. Goddess, you must chase away the ghosts. All of you see here, come here. Let's sprinkle sacred ash. Gents first. - You first Don't get scared, I'm with you. Come bravely. Shall I apply sacred ash? Turn him and apply ash on his forehead. Don't I know that? I'm unable to do it. Please hold my hand. She's shivering like an electrocuted crow. Hold hand. Don't get scared. All are cowards. Turn...turn... Why are you all like ghosts? Mother, you look horrible. My son is in jovial mood. Sister, ghost hasn't left him. It says it'll kill me. How dare! You talk bad about my son. You're calling him as brother, send him out. Brother, I'll kill you. Get up and take bath, I'll get you almond milk. You too come with us. Boss! Boss, I'll get milk. Fool! Who wants milk? - Don't want? Get me soup! Boss, give company to ghost, I'll get soup. He's leaving me with ghost. Hey orangutan! Come closer. Only you're here, you fool! Come here. Dog's tail! Fox's horn! Elephant's egg! Berry seed! What is he up to? Soup is ready. What's all this? This is soup to chase out ghosts. You mean medicine to ghosts. Not my words but a great Siddha doctor said this. Cook, Siddha is always right. Lock up the ghost with this soup. Give me little for taste. This is not for dogs, I mean for ghosts only. Serve it. - Serve it yourself. I think you're scared of it. Go. Ghost will get kicked out with my soup. Ghost is finished tonight! Brother...brother... Where are you, brother? I've brought hot soup for you. How come brother turned like this? Am I not beautiful? You look great! How could you change so much in so short time! Don't I look good? You look ravishing! Which man wouldn't love a beautiful thing like you? For you? - I'm also a man, right? Man must have moustache, you fool! My mother used to give me bath by applying turmeric, that's why no moustache. For your mother? - Nasty fun! For me. Whatever goes in will come out in short time. How? - Like this! Where is he? Missing? Are women so cheap to you? Women are like Gods to me. Why are you coming like you got raped? There's a beautiful girl inside... - Beautiful girl? Though I don't have moustache, kissed me... I got it. The girl likes men without moustache, right? Moustache is the problem. You're jealous of my skinhead. Watch my romance now! He's not listening to me. He'll not get sense without getting thrashed... It's me! If I kiss her, brother won't mistake me, right? Brother is going to kiss. What are you saying? - I said it's brother's plan. Trust me and go, get a good thrashing. I feel very shy! Go with same shyness, he'll give good thrashing. For the night of romance... Thrashing! Brother! Where's brother? Will you meet only him? I don't want to meet brother. I want only this beautiful angel. Then, you start it. So quickly! I don't know where to start! Shall I start it? Perfect figure! Come...does your nasty face need an angel? I'll not ask... Come... God bless you. - Thanks. I saw you coming out in brief, I misunderstood it. If we stay here another minute, ghost will make a soup of us. Come, let's tell sister and leave the place. He may hear us, let's go away without informing them. You're going around half naked in a house with woman. Where are women here? There are only ghosts. I'll hit you. We didn't mean your wife. What happened to my brother? What was their crime that you're thrashing them? Are you giving respect a brother-in-law deserves? Forget about respect, we searched all over the place. Where have you hidden 4 kilos of gold? Who told you there are 4 kilos of gold in this house? We came here knowing your wife came with 4 kilos of gold. That's true. - What truth? It's true they promised 4 kilos of gold as dowry. Okay. But reduced it to 3 kilos when we got engaged. Go further. It was reduced to 2 kilos when we got married. Then? On our first night, she walked in without anything. Why are you telling us? She came without a gram of gold. Are you wearing fake jewels? Gold plated jewellary, brother. You elf! We don't want anything with you. What about biryani? - Serve everything to him. Come. Are you still here? We're going. - We left long ago. Come. What happened to you? You said there's ghost in house, did you tell it'll hit us? Dogs will bite and ghosts will hit, don't you know that as a police officer? Tell me, why are you behaving like this? Your activities are not good. As you said ghost thrashed my husband. You must come to chase it out. I can only identify the ghost. There's a man in Darga to chase it away. What happened to you? Any hormonal problem? Let's consult a doctor. I'm sparing you because you're a girl, go away. I'll not go. Come with me. Don't know what's happening here! What happened to you? - Don't touch her. What's this a girl here? - Our son's class mate. Why did she come here? Are we running tuition centre here? How would I know? He's not a boy any more, he has become a woman. What? - Please save him. Please save my son. Come. Allah, give me power to destroy this ghost. Allah, chase out the ghost! Don't get scared. Why is he coming flying? Ghost! Are you here to destroy me instead of warding of evil from shops? I'll spare your life, go away. If not I'll reduce you to ashes. Who are you, devil? I'll not leave this place without arresting you in this with Allah's grace. Are you here to fight with me? Come on! Chase out this devil! Do you know what this is? This is sword blessed by Allah a fter fulfilling a vow. I'll destroy you, devil. If you don't tell me who you are... I'll tie you with this. -Don't do it, bhai. Don't do it, bhai. Who are you? Don't chase me out from this body. No, bhai. - Your game is over. My son...my son... If you don't tell me who you are, I'll send you out of this world. Shall I destroy you? Tell me, devil. My name is Pottu! Your attention please! Our village didn't get sun light for 3 months now. There's no word from Pottuamma. Today Pottuamma will speak to us! This is order of headman! Pottuamma is here! Greetings, mother. If you remain silent further, this village can't survive. People here live on your hope only, give a good message to people here. Come, mother. Sit on the throne of God and give a good message to people, mother. Pottuamma, protect us, mother! Give us good message, mother. Our village is in darkness, shed light on us, mother. Tomorrow morning, sun will shed light on our village. Agriculture will prosper. Hunger will go away from here. This is Goddess's voice! Mother Pottuamma! Without sun light for 3 months. People slept peacefully hoping my word will come true next day. Pottuamma's word has come true! Sun has risen! All of you come out and see! Good times are here! Mother! You're manifestation of pure love... Mother, you're epitome of respect.... Mother, you're paradigm of courage... Mother....Goddess of Trident... Mother, Goddess Kali... You're our saviour and protector... Mother, you're our God Mother.... We witnessed your divine charm, we became your ardent devotees... Everything here is your grace... O Mother.... Gods will also come to seek your blessings.... You're an incarnation of Goddess... O Mother... Even thunders and lightning didn't scare you... People living in these hills are your children... We lived here in peace with animals and plants... No more bad days, it's happiness all the way... We pray you like Goddess, we're your devotees... You're our land, cattle and God... We came here dancing and singing paeans about you... We're blessed that you're among us, O Mother... You're an epitome of love and grace... We'll offer you divine offerings... This is the happiest moment for everyone here... We live simple as per your advice... Mother! What happened to you, mother? I don't know, I feel like my body is burning. What's this new habit? Why did you bring doctor from downhill for this, father? I didn't call him, he came here to meet you. Greetings. - Greetings. It was very difficult to reach your mountain village by car. But your daughter walked 20 kms to study and topped the state. State topper will get first seat in my college. It's my good fortune to admit such a brilliant student in my college. What are you trying to say, sir? Medical education has become business now, I'm doing it as service. You must join my medical college and become a doctor to serve 27 villages here. That's my wish. Forgive me for refusing your offer, sir. I'm blessed to be born here. I studied plus 2 to teach children here to study. I don't like to go to city to study. Please go away without any further discussion. Entire village considers you as Goddess. Shouldn't you serve these people as doctor? Doctor, you said Pottuamma is Goddess to us. Just her divine touch is enough to get rid of diseases. You can go, sir. You came this far for her, but we can't go against her word. Mind your work, please. Go. Why are they refusing a golden chance? Don't know what happened? Someone got hurt. Put the cot here. Careful! Open your eyes, dear. Father! - What's it, dear? Don't know what happened? How did it happen? - Please give me way. What happened to my child? She was playing normally, suddenly she fell unconscious. What are you waiting for? Get herbal doctor from downhill immediately Wait....where's Pachamalai? Just 32 miles from here, sir. - 32 miles? She'll die meanwhile. Can I treat her? - Sir, we'll do it in our way. Child's condition is serious. Wait, let him check. You treat her, sir. Get me emergency box. Serious head injury. Sir, you saved my child. Nothing has happened to you. Give her some water. Thank you, sir. You saved a child's life. I didn't save her, medicine saved her life. Only a doctor knows what medicine to administer to save a patient. It is important to educate children. It is more important to save a life, right? One can walk 20 kms to study. Can one walk 32 miles to save a life? Time is very important for medical treatment. Think over it. Mother, you must study medicine. Yes, you must study, mother. Calm down, please. Say you will study, mother! I'll study for your sake. Greetings, doctor! Sir, please save our brother. One who tries to save a life is doctor. But only God saves! I got phone that patient is serious, I'll try my level best. Be brave...be brave... Mother, please save Karuppaiah. What happened to Karuppaiah? -He suddenly fell unconscious. If doctor hadn't come there, my brother would've died by now. Yes, mother. - I'll meet dean. Pulse rate is getting down... Dean, Karuppaiah... Patient's condition is very serious. Head injury has affected his cerebellum and he has lost his memory power. You're a medical student, you can understand it well. If his body organs are donated, he can give new life to many patients. You must tell and convince them. - How can I? I beg you as a doctor. Please help few others to live longer. You don't have to beg. We know whatever you do is for our benefit only. Can I meet Karuppaiah one last time? Time is running short, go, meet him. No one is allowed inside, operation is in progress. Nurse, leave her. - I must meet him. Come, Pottu. - He's still alive. He called me now. Nothing has happened to him, please save his life. It's all over! Sorry. Hubby...hubby... What's it? I fear of losing our elder daughter Pottuamma and younger daughter Ponniyamma. Why do you feel like that? Something wrong is happening in the college Pottu is studying. Four people from our village went there for treatment, all of them returned dead. You got our younger daughter also admitted in the same hospital. I'm scared, let's go and bring back our daughters. Don't talk as if you've seen the unseen. Elder daughter must become doctor. Younger daughter must get well. That's why I'm struggling, right? You got me admitted into the hospital for a small wound. They killed me too! What are you saying, father? Your mother appeared in dream and warned me. I don't think it is not safe for you to study here. Patients weren't admitted at right time. That's why they died because of complications. The day you left village, God has stopped speaking to us. I feel we lost the power of foreseeing the future because of your studies in city. Enough of what we've lost. We mustn't lose your sister too. Nothing will happen to sister, doctor will surely save her. No, mother. You're talking like a doctor not as our Goddess. That's why you're unable to understand what we feel as bad! Okay, let's see sister, father. Okay. - Come. Sister is fine, right? Father, sister's pulse rate is normal. There's no danger to her life. I think someone is coming. If they see others in ICU ward, they'll scold me. Hide quickly. - Okay. Dr.Somasundaram sent us here. You're the duty doctor, right? - Yes. This patient's heart must be sent to Dubai by today 11.30 AM flight. Wait outside, they'll come now. What's it, dear? Something illegal is going on here without Dean's knowledge, father. We must inform him, pick up sister. This side, father. Come, Pottu! What happened? Dean, we're coming to meet you. They're planning to harvest my sister's heart. Something illegal is going on here without your knowledge. Doctor, our entire village considered you as God. You cheated us, doctor. Did I say I'm God? Did I? Is he in our list? - No, sir. Then, throw him out of this compound. Sir, no please... Do whatever you want with me, please don't harm her. Come, man! Father! Mother! Father! Get their throne! Throne of Pottuamma! He's sitting on the throne of our God... I had come to your village and begged you to study medicine, do you know why? For Bombay blood group heart! That's my business. Are you surprized how I knew people in your village had Bombay blood group? Run...run...public announcement! Your attention please! To prevent various fevers! To treat and give free medicines, city Doctor is here, get your blood tested, this is headman's order! Come, get your blood test done. So many in a mountain village are having Bombay blood group. What's Bombay blood group? In 1952 an accident happened in Bombay, patient who was fighting death, no blood matched his blood group. only then medical fraternity came to know about new blood group. Medically it is known as HH, some call it as OH. Since it was discovered in Bombay, it is known as Bombay blood. Many had died without getting this rare blood group. Dean, you cheated us with this divine profession of medicine. Don't you've a heart? - No! A Bombay blood group heart is worth Rs.7 crores! Would I leave it? Only 70000 people in this world have this blood group. Your mountain village is worth hundreds of cores. I know the medical value, would I let go the opportunity? I wanted to play the game with you as main player. So I decided to give you seat in my college. But you and your father refused my offer. That's why I used your sister as pawn to get your approval. Ice boys.... - Children, play carefully. Ponni, Selvi is hiding in street. You're here, right? 7 people of your village didn't die naturally. We've done blood test to all of them. Doctor! Greetings, sir. How are you, Karuppaiah? - I'm fine, sir. Tell me if I've to announce anything, blood will freeze if I'm jobless, right? He's talking about blood with us. Is he in our list? - I'll check, doctor. I asked just a job. Why are they thinking so much? He's seventh in our list. - Let's make him our first victim. Get ready injection. Brother, come here. - Sir...coming, sir. Tell me, sir. Your public announcements are not that loud. Open your mouth. Open your mouth again. You, your father and your sister are next in the list. Father...sister... Using you, I'll harvest Bombay blood group organs from 27 villages. I thought I'll take your heart after that. But fate has decided to kill you earlier. I went for your father to village, they said he's here. That's why I brought this chair also. It seems you talk to your people sitting on this throne. No need of doing it anymore. Customers are waiting for the hearts of your family. We don't come down from mountains because of people like you. Our God will keep an account of your sins. Take him to operation theatre. Doctor, there's still life in the dead body on operation table. Come and see. - What are you saying? It's respiring....come... Come...come...- Go. Look at this, doctor! How could she breathe? How? We've harvested all her organs. This is medical miracle. I didn't die even after they took away all my body organs. He brought a sorceress to arrest me. That's Brahmeshwari! How much time has passed since you removed her heart? 4 hours. Still not pacified! RK, you entered troubled waters without knowing the depth. What should I do now? I can arrest even the vilest spirit. It is very difficult to keep under control such a divine soul. Hail Goddess Kali! I must arrest under the spell of divine hymn. Bury her. I'm going to arrest her soul using every evil spirit at my disposal. Evil spirits in this cremation must stand guard and shouldn't allow her to leave this place. Let these divine amulets become shackles and tie her down here. Close the ditch before the fire dies down. We will! What was her blood group? - Bombay blood. 0Not a drop of same blood group must fall on her grave. If it touches? Evil soul will break free from the divine shackles. I brought you here to save my life. I can't spend my life guarding this cremation ground. This is divine stone I got after 14 years of penance and blessed by King Cobra! No evil spirit can harm you till this is on you. Wear it. - Give me. I came with great hope to become a doctor. But that sinner killed me brutally for my Bombay blood group heart. I and my family members were around the college to get released. He entered the college, through his blood... I got this body. Fearing doctor would kill him if he comes t o know he has Bombay blood group. I changed his records in college. She changed blood reports also, how smart she is! He too belongs to Bombay blood group! Had you know this, you would've killed him also, right? Bhai...no...don't split me from this body. He's very bad man! Till I kill him, please don't force me to leave this body. I can't accept you torturing him and his family for your personal revenge. Even if I spare you, that evil sorceress will not space you. 9 planets, 27 starts! I want a man born on full moon day and lunar eclipse day, with star of Mrigaseera! Guru, you're reading my horoscope. You betrayed me though I was always loyal to you. Why did you kill him? - I can save you only if I kill him. His soul will bring back Pottu's soul. Go! Pottu! Did you blind me? No! Please don't anything! Please tell her not to harm my son. If you try to do anything now, I'll take him also with me. Please tell her not to harm my son, please.... Save my son. - Don't do anything. The only thing I have is this body. Shall I destroy it? I'll give you 3 days time, finish your job by full moon day and leave his body. Promise on Allah! Promise! Promise! What happened to you, sir? What happened? Sorceress took away your son. Did sorceress take away my son? Who is it? You sent him to bring me, right? I brought him to you. I'll bring curtains down to your game. You can never do it. - Are you challenging me? Look at this! This evil spirit must die before this day changes. You can't break it. Don't support injustice! Leave me I arrested you in a vessel. I'll bury you deep in sea crossing seven seas. No, he left that sinner. He'll destroy our entire village. Don't stop me, allow me to kill him. Sister, he took away my heart when I was still alive. Don't protect him. Can't a mother's heart understand our pain? Come out! Don't destroy me....I must kill him. No...no.. Fall at the feet of Goddess Pottuamman in mountains to save your son. O Goddess Mother! Saviour of this world! Goddess of mountains, Consort of Lord Shiva.... Goddess riding on tiger... Goddess, your grace can soothe any pain... Goddess, come and save a soul... Your blessing can change fate and betrayal... Come to change the power of arrogance... Come with divine trident to destroy evil... Come to protect and save us... Hail Goddess Kali! Let justice prevail... Save a life, O Mother... Hear our prayers and show us the right path... Mother, you will come to fulfill our wish... You're the power house to create or destroy anything... Where is he? Our God will keep an account of your sins. Get up! She√Öfs seething with rage to avenge you! Don't get scared! I'll save your life risking my life! Come....come... Come.... Are you playing with me? Come on! What happened, Brahmeshwari? He stabbed me, but I'll not spare him. She's no ordinary woman, I was her trusted lieutenant but she killed me too! I'll transfer my soul into your body! Kill him!
