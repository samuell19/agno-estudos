-Aren't you gonna help me? -How? -Dumbass! -What do you need my help for? Isn't that the White Horse? That one? No. You're getting a unibrow. So ugly! You look pretty. Really. Where did you get all this from? Don't know. It was already here. Look! -Will this fit you? -Get it off me! Can you picture Elena with this? Come on, girl. Put it on! You got me all dirty! What's that? Damn! What a jet! Fuck! She saw me. They're gonna hear us. Get down from there! It's full of holes there! It can collapse at any time! Get down! What are you doing here? Where are you from? From Santiago. And you? From around here. How long are you staying? We're just collecting samples from around here. We're biologists. Don't go telling your mom, or they'll cut us our vacation. -You're the snitch here. -Stop it! Mom! -Looking good. -Me? Nah. -What's this? -Sweet potato. -The only thing I could find. -It's good for the hair. What's this? Where did it come from? Where do you think? From the sea. Are you hungry? Here, let me show you. No need to scale this one, kid. Look. First, you remove the fin. Then you remove this. And then you cut it right here. See? AUGUST Carli! -Bye! -Bye! See you! Dumbass! Take that shit off, man. Fuck, Mandy! Stop it. You're gonna wash that! Don't be such a cry baby. Look... Take mine if you want. You don't need it anyway. How is it there? There's a boardwalk too, but with bigger ships. The ones here are shit. Look. This one's good for playing ball. Feel the weight. Strikeout! Who's the batter that's always given out? -Who is it? -You! Because you suck! But I get to go somewhere on holidays! -I don't wanna go anywhere. -Cut the crap! Here. You saw the teacher crying at school? They say her husband disappeared. He left and never came back. Which teacher? The one in the courtyard. My dad says he left. He went off in a boat and could be in Puerto Rico now. Man, you always know everything. Her husband was a fisherman. He went out to sea, and waited for the ferry from Miami to Puerto Rico. Maybe. My grandmother says he left her for another woman. And now she's half-crazy. She even goes out naked. Hey, I swear! I'd listen to him. Knowing him, he already has a picture of her. Me? -I don't do that kind of thing. -So you say. Listen... I got into Art School. Fuck! Now what? The incident took place in the early hours of July 13th. A tugboat was found seven miles north of the Bay of Havana. It appears it belonged to a shipowner... I'm going with Elena. That's the long way home. He goes off with his girlfriend and leaves us hanging. Girlfriend? Let him go wherever he wants. Give us a hug. We won't see each other till school begins. Oh, males in heat. -Come on. Let us squeeze you too. -Not a chance! -Ignore them. They're jealous! -"Not a chance", she says. Come on! In the early hours of the morning, poor navigation and strength of tides meant that only 31 people could be saved. You fell asleep. I'm gonna take the lamp, OK? Yeah, sure. This unfortunate incident proves, once again, how immoral individuals put at risk the lives of so many people, including women and children, who are trying to migrate illegally to another country. -How was it? -Good, normal. People said goodbye. Wake her up. Get her to eat it all up. Why is it so dark? We're saving, Grandma. -Did you shower already? -Not yet. Want me to give you a bath? Later. We also counted with international collaboration coordinated by the PAHO and the WHO. From December onwards, just a few sporadic cases have been reported. This year, only 500 cases have been reported. These cases were principally... The affected patients worked in the tobacco industry, and went to get their eyes tested because they suffered from lateral visual impairment, color vision deficiency and subacute inflammation. Considering these symptoms, patients were diagnosed with a form of visual impairment. 43.3% of presented cases suffered from peripheral neuropathy. During the second semester of 1992, more cases were reported in other provinces of the country. The following year, an increase in the number of cases was reported during the first semester. Only 500 cases have been reported so far. Our commander in chief, Fidel Castro will attend the event. You really thought we had nothing else for you? Your end of school gift! Go on. -What is it? -Open it! Try them on. Go on. Try them on. It's so hot! I think they're a bit tight. No, that's your size. It fits you perfectly. They taste good? I don't know. My dad has them for show. My uncle brought one. A couple of months ago. Their meat is white. You know, like chicken. Dad says the ones from here have the best meat. -They get fat faster... -Hold on. Who's that? Damn! Gonna move here. My neighbor's, like, 100. Nothing to see there. -Will she be there now? -If you don't know... Told you she gets naked. Look. Her hand is in her pussy. Carlitos... Your grandpa's in the room. He says he's hungry. Wake up, Carlitos. Come on! He says he's starving to death here. He won't let me sleep. Come on. Come. Come with me. Let's go. Oh, grandma... He always disappears when things get heavy. No, Mandy, No. What's up? Just hanging out. -I dreamed about that teacher. -Really? -It was more of a nightmare. -You wish! Wait for me. Look at this. Gimme your hand. Your hand's cold. Are you scared of me? Shall we go? Clear the area. Go on! What happened? Nothing. Hop on. Hop on. No, I'll walk. -Why? -I'm meeting Mandy. OK, but don't stay around here. Go back to town. The town exit is that way. Get them on the bus. Clear the area, comrades. There's nothing to see here. Up! Water! -Shower first, though. -Why? Because I say so. I'm dying of thirst! Hand me that glass. Here, Grandma. Aren't you hot? I'm burning up. -We'll go to the beach tomorrow. -Really? -Not again! -For fuck's sake! Fuck. What if someone out there steals my stuff? If they haven't done it by now, they won't. Grandma... Did you have a boyfriend before Grandpa? Half the town was after me. My first boyfriend was a tall man. He was like two meters tall. He looked like a tree. But he was a brute. He always wanted to stick it in me without any foreplay. As if I was a mare! But your grandfather... He used to go down on me for a long time before he put it in me. His wasn't that big, but he sure knew how to use it. You understand? Did grandpa have a small dick? Grandpa? He was a saint. Elena! -Yes? -Let's go for a walk. Come on. And Mandy? Wait. Mom, I'm going out. Don't come back too late, sweetie. THE PEOPLE UNITED WILL NEVER BE DEFEATED What's up? Tell me something. I have nothing to say. I went out last night. -Why didn't you come to see me? -I don't know. I see. Not here. My mom will find out. Come on.

Fed by people's desire to get to the United States, acts of vandalism were committed today in the city of Havana. The brave presence of our commander in chief, Fidel Castro Ruz, cut short these unpleasant events encouraged by the anti-Cuban mob. If the United States... don't take quick and efficient measures for... Go get the dishes. ...to stop encouraging illegal departures from our country. Then, we will be forced to instruct our Border Guard not to block... Don't take it out on him. ...any vessel trying to leave Cuba. Maria, open up. They're waiting for us! Come on! Shit!

Let's row, row, row Our Lady of Regla will protect us Let's row, row, row Let's row, row, row Let's row, row, row Our Lady of Regla will protect us Our Havana correspondent is reporting from there. Ramshackle boats are being hastily put together. Many are barely buoyant. In most cases, they sink as soon as they touch the water. The ones that resist this initial test risk falling apart in the harsh open water. But in Havana, Cubans desperately trying to flee a regime of hunger, blackouts, shortage of medicines and basic goods, prefer to die instead of living under Castro's tyranny. President Bill Clinton ordered the Navy to establish a humanitarian corridor around the island with the aim of helping to rescue Cubans trying to reach the shores of Florida. Lately, the amount of people trying to reach the United States has grown exponentially. The reality of this situation... Did you lock up the house? FROM YOUR BELOVED GRANDSON Did you see how they left? Wait a second. You're Juan Carlos' son, right? We work with him. Anything you need, just let us know. -So? -They went fishing, as usual. And they took their whole family with them. And nobody knew? They said they were going to a party. Here. Here. The hammer first. Keep it in your hand. Hold it firmly. Find a comfortable position. Go ahead. Grab the hammer. Grab the hammer, Carlitos. Place it in the hole. That's not the one I pointed at. The one next to it. Find the hole. Go on. Hard. Harder. Gimme that. Hold it there. Hold it! What's wrong? I couldn't say goodbye. Sometimes you just can't. Hold tight. Quiet. People are sleeping. Pick it up. Easy, man. Slow down. Careful with that. Go ahead, lift it. What's all that? We need the money. Don't move. I think it fits you. It's good now. -Fuck! -I told you, man. I told you! Where will we find another one? Come on in. Have a seat. -How's your family? -Fine. -Would you like some water? -No, thank you. Where's Carlos? -You want me to go get him? -Yes. Elena came to see you. Tell her I'm not home. Why's that? I'll tell her that you're asleep. You'll have to come some other time. He's asleep. All right, then. -Tell him to come by my house. -Don't worry. I'll tell him. Please, it's important. I haven't received permission to sell yet. -How long do we have to wait? -Go and complain at the office. They sent us here! Tell us how it works. When will the groceries be available? I don't know! How can you not know? How's it possible that you don't know? I'm not the boss. It's happened before. Come on! Be careful with that arm! What's wrong with you? You hit me in the eye! Don't you dare touch me! Ladies! Now you show up? Why did you refuse to see her? Now what? I don't know. Did they leave in a raft? Her grandpa has one of those large boats that go into the Gulf. The rest of the family came and they left. So? You and Elena? Nothing ever happened between us. I knew you were into her. Yes, but you liked her. You didn't see a thing. A strong swell is expected in the north and south coasts, and there's a warning in place for small vessels. Winds will reach speeds of 25-40km/h. Especially, close to the shore area. Maria! Minimum temperatures at dawn will be between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius. Hand me the lamp. Here it is. Everything will be OK. Take care. Pick that up. Where's Dad? He said he was taking care of some stuff. When is he back? Don't know. He's never very clear. You think I can't figure things out? Here. -Did you eat already? -No, not hungry. -Here. -No, you eat it. -Take it. -I said no. You eat it. Reyes, Luis. Velasquez, Luisa Maria. Nunez Oliva, Alexis. Gonzalez, Ruperto. Coto, Mayela.

The report also lists the people picked up in boats at sea, or those who got to the United States and authorities are taking them... We're one player short! Yours, Carli! Go on, go on. It's yours, man. You suck! -Carlitos. -Pick it up, dude. Such a wuss! Did you leave the house unattended? The rabbits were hungry. -I'll get going. -Wait for me. -See ya. -Take care, man. Game's over. Everyone, go home! Let me see. They won't eat this one. Let's see. This one, they will. -What about this one? -Yeah, they'll eat that. But not these. -But they're so similar. -Yeah.

Come on, man. -Come with us. -Come! Hand me that box. Give me a hand. Help me get her in, please. I'm giving you half a sack of sugar, the two cases of rum you asked for, and four water containers.
