Where did he go? Stop it! Stop it! - It's all right .. Keep it! Curses, fuck you, look at them! The bathroom is organised! Let's give you a bow tie on this - that while flying. Does your native country fatten you to lie here like creatures? You have to stay in the squares with planes and record the mistakes of their comrades in the curriculum. Clear? Aye. Tiraspol, an old rifle, today you are a flight crew member. I want here to be there! Clear? - Clearly. We have to work. - Run! Okay, let's get bakes. Boris, you're fine to fly! Good luck! - God heard you. What is he doing? Isn't he mad? Apparently lost the landmark. What kind of landmark? There are only three trees in the area. There the winds are like a pipe. They will turn it over, not a fool. I'm picking up speed, doing a looping .. Then I go out on a bend and make another loop. You know? And then I'm going to mistletoe, I'm slowing down. Fight and the asterisks? The stars... What are you for? OK! Although you are from Odessa, you are a fool. She did not know who to be a friend of mine. OK!

Get out, guys! They call us at the headquarters. Hang on! You will count on the execution of the combat task. Gorbune wants to surrender everything. If you have any values, awards - against a receipt. They closed me! - Well, stay there then. Let me go! You're a good boy. Why did you close it? - Because he's a bastard. You must personally hand them over and get a receipt. You will get so much for the "bastard". - Drop it, let's go. I will not be long. The kit is now full. These two will continue on. You and Sobolev - to the end point. Comrade Head of the school! "Are your papers okay?" Aye! - Then disappear. But our train is in the evening, etc. Lieutenant. Shut up, counter! Devil has taken you! Do you see what happens? Comrade Lieutenant, call Daddy - Colonel Shcherbatov. You will pass without your dad. Who closed it? They closed me! All the best! On a good path, Boris. If.... In short - luck! Let's go. Hey, you, fools fucked without pants! Are you flying high? To kill you there right away! Both you and you! All to kill you! See you soon. Fight, yours. - Come on, forward! Hello. - Hello. Apples for the road. - And I baked the jellyfish. Sama. We wait more than an hour. - And the school? We ran out of chemistry. - Bravo to you! Attention! Hey, Fedka! - Two, we catch up! Come on, give it! Focus sharply! Give me too! Shura, that's enough! Come on! Valya! Valya, go.... Catch us! Wait. Kolya, the train is late for an hour and a half.

Kola, come on! TASHKENT-BHARA Fight! - Borka! No need! Fight, come on for a while. Do you see the one who stands by my Vera? He was interested in you. His name is Tamara Nikolaevna. Teacher from the regional Center. He is on vacation. So what? A beautiful and prominent woman. What can I tell her? Shall we gather tomorrow at Vera? There is a turntable and so on. Come on! Wonderful, then promised. Tankists beat ours! Give me the pilot! - Do not go! Fight! - Fight, let's go. Patrol! Patrol! Did it hurt you? - It's all because of it Elisaveta Sergeevna. She loves the tankers. Do you want a shit? How much does it cost? - What is this? No, I will not. Well, guys, with health. - All the best! Come on, I'll see you. "So we'll write. Fight, leave! - I'm coming, I'm coming. Careful! BUY THE WINES WITH YOUR BLOOD Comrade Captain, the former.... - All right, get the papers. So.... Bochkov? Unhappiness of the parents, who has fallen with his commander. Month…. No court. By order of the head of the school. With the right to return to his part. Kudryvtsev? A stolen parachute. Who do you need this parachute? To jump off the roof? Month…. By order... right.... Tiraspol. Soplanco! - Month…. rightfully. It is. You can go. - Listen. Is this, etc.? Captain? - Wait, Chentzov. We'll get more. Good-bye, Shurka. - Good-bye. Hold on. - End of the Good-bye. Get out of here. The next one! Hrustalov and Rudman. Group burglary, 25 each. Maximum. And what did you steal? Flour. - Flour? Yes, flour. "Where are you evacuated?" From Dnepropetrovsk. And where did you do it? - At the station. Much? - A lot. About three pounds. Well.... mum is sick.... This is illegal. How old are you? Eighteen. - Eighteen. What? Maybe thirteen? Good men! Do not you see? I take them. Chinzov! All to be built for inspection! - Get out and build! You too. - Move! Who am I talking about? Close the door. Do you want? - I'm in service. If you will. Personal belongings: knives, money, watches, to surrender to the sergeant. Knives, money, watches.... to surrender to the sergeant. Knives, money, watches? - I don't. Fuck! Shit! But future commanders! Shut up! Who said that? Peaceful! On the left! Walk down the march! Raz! Raz! One two Three! With your left shoulder forward! Raz! Raz! One two Three! Move a little. That's what a crap is gathered! Only one is really "baked". His sentence is over 100 years with the escapes. Who is it? That's the one there. Cadet.... He takes them to me.... Aha. - Don't! Dear Sirs, Give me your shoes. They're stylish. Hey, leave it, do you hear? - What the fuck do you care about? Come on, Baule, end this one! What do you want? - I already told you. Look at him how bad he is. - I with the buckwheat, not with you. I'll crush you, bastard! Shit! Get up! Peaceful! Stay up! Get out for a divorce! Let there be thousands. We're eleven here. We will not give our land and honour to the enemy! We will not give our land and honour to the enemy! He knows Stalin, our father, knows the mother. The native, that the Soviet fighter is not accustomed to retreat. Shut up! Rota, stay! Who sang? Lie down! Who sang? Lie down! Who sang? Get up! Lie down! Get up! Lie down! Get up! Lie down! Peaceful! Comrade Captain, the company deals with the schedule of the day. Sergeant Kravets Sr. Sergeant Sergeant. Well? Who still thinks he has fallen into Alexandrov's people, and not in a punitive company? - Me. Oh, that was Tiraspol of Odessa. Cravat! - Me. Explain his rights and obligations. - Listen! Whoever thinks he has fallen into Alexandrov's people, not a punitive company, is a double fool. First, because he's here, and second, because he did not know where he was. Your country will not replace you for singing camp for a month in the criminal squad. We will sing with you, but this will be another singing. Go! Your rights and obligations.... By the evening should be like in the Moscow subway. And that too. Trophy. Will we exchange it? "Anything else?" Something I have not begun to hear. Or you got very naughty, nasty! I'll make you shit without chemistry. Get your hands off or I'll shoot you in the first fight. Do you understand? This Tiraspol has become very subdued. He refuses to obey. He did not give up his watch. This part, left! Four steps ahead, go march! Right! This will be the First Pluto. Saralidze! - Me. You will be senior. - Listen! This will be the Second Squad. Tiraspol! - Me. You will be senior. I listen. Tiraspol.... how are you? Should I pour you? Peaceful! Revelation to the right! Comrade Captain, Criminal Company is built for departure. - Free! Commander of a platoon, with me! First and third cargo are ours. Get on platoons! Listen! Pump, circle! To the right, one to the wagon! Give me a hand! - Come on, Kolya. Careful! Watch! Move away! - Come on, come on. Don't interfere, my friend. Hang on! He wants me to shoot you when you try to escape the sneak! So be on guard, Bury. Grisha's come! Tamara, get acquainted. This is Grisha's friend. Grisha, what did you bring? It is beautiful! - Don't be fooled. Grisha, come here. Grisha.... everything is ready. Now we will begin. And this is home made wine. I took it from my neighbour. Grisha, don't pour me so much. Just a little. Gosh, say toast! For dating! Wait! Let's go to Bulgaria. Wait! Wait here! This is Lyusia - the neighbour. Faster! Stay up! Beg a march! Hey, the long one! Scarecrow! Here, grab! That's a small one. Oh, petty, hold on! Vollotapiev, hold on! You, the Chipmunk! Get it! Glazed, this is for you.... Look! - What's wrong? He was a piercing bullet. Apparently they have taken them off from the previous workers. Faster! Hurry up, Captain! - Go to hell! Keep a distance! Air! - Scatter! Lie down! Where? Where are you going? I have to shoot! Come on, shit! Exit! Stay up! Stay up, faster! Creep, stay! Right! Here are the lists. Hostanino, it's time for lunch. - Ah, Dankovets! Are you the third time with us? It was hard for you, my joy. Odecco, Ardov, Bikov.... - Me. Imiddinov - in the first platoon. Dankovets, NIKITIN.... - Me. And what, boys-pioneers? Is there anyone from Odessa? You are all uncouth. - The accompanying security guard! Sorry, we didn't make it clear. - Swim on, shit. What? - Stinky shit! And I have to teach you. Follow me, go march! Get your way, sergeant. Sergeant, what are you up there? - I'm coming. Rota, flats! To the right, one to get a weapon. Tiraspol, 13-800-77. Hrustalov, Rudman, to me! Dankovets, 32-30-21. Accept helpers, Nikolay Ivanic. At the command of the senior. What do you need to answer? - Listen. Here it is. Nothing. You will be better with me. Do not load! It isn't allowed. We do not have machines, grenades are not laid, machine guns - too. We only have to die! But we'll answer that with.... ... with middle finger. Friend, treat yourself to Belomor! Ass-hole! Dankovets! The people of Grigoriev are on the third day. And here how is it? - It's quiet now. Once they have sent us here, then that is the main clash here. Have you heard what happened last winter? Last winter I was at Karelsky. A whole division has been slaughtered for a week. And now we are in one place. No back, no forward. Which can't be bypassed or taken over, everything in the sack. Do you ask me? Ask those on whose pants there are seams. Unknown why, but can't. Rota, stay! Spread! Stay down! Glushak, Seleznyov, Saralidze, Tiraspolski, to me! After me! And what is there? - Where? Here, to the overturned truck, after the peat. Do not go there. There are mines every meter. Everywhere there are mines. The metal detectors don't detect them. There is as much iron and peat in the swamp. Efforts have been made for a year and a half. What do we do, Commander? Was any of you at the Theatre? The operetta. Take a look at the Theatre of future combat operations. Most of you have not seen at all. How much did you give to your country? On some five, and on others and 10. What? Are you all murderers? Everyone knows, Father. And what for you? Guys, give something to warm up. - Right there. The boys were there last time there. And these "cleaners" are with you? "We are with us, my father. Security. What are they guarding? "They keep the Motherland from us. And we of the Germans - not to kill anyone accidentally. We can not be without a guard at all. Are they all, Andrushak? - All. Then let's go. It's annoying. If you take all of this, will they forgive you? Suvorov! We will go without you. Boys, give God to win and live. Have you already seen it? Did you see the half-destroyed building? They say that the foundations and burials have been preserved there. At night, we'll crawl up there. I did not understand your joke, Borrenka. Why did not you say you were from Odessa? Hang on! From the landlord. It will help you. Do you know of our songs? There, at Fondukleyevska, they opened the pub. A powerful song. Unfold! The loot of the swamp. There are such things in stacks. Comrade Captain, this is for you. Leo! Leo, they've brought you to a bad shelter. The man has died in a bombardment, and you give him something from a dead man. That's not good. Wadding gases? - No, worse. They smell of rotten eggs. So I will whisper a bit, and you can see where they're firing from. Do you understand? Go ahead! Fool.... You will go.... These nasty beatings on us. Let's shoot them for a start. What's wrong with you? - From the stench. I can not get used to…. What does it smell like? Did you cut them off? - No. So.... Understood. Perhaps the body of others has parts other than ass-hole. Look, there's a nest underneath the overturned trolley, but everywhere - mines. And another time you will reach him. He's got somewhere here, the bastard. Let's get out of here…. Let's get out while it's quiet. But I ask you very much, Borenka, do not get away from me. This is not Odessa's main street. Stay! Where are you going? - Dirty pigs! Fascists! He stood up and fled. Why did I flee? Where is the other? He torn it. He also got up and fled. He runs and shoots like a madman. It was from the tank school. As long as it's not a fucking twilight, take it up. Fight, and I wanted to do the same. I thought I was crazy. Me too. Hey! Hey, uh... Fuck him! Who are you? "What, don't you see?" We are from the company. Call the Lieutenant! - From the company? From the special company. Call the Lieutenant! Hey, come on! - What's wrong? We got injured. - Get the wounded! Lieutenant, tell your fool to recognise his, that next time I will throw you one.... Stay healthy, come on. Why do you call it that? Where is their friendship? Here it is accepted that these behind you are called "land". Do not call them any more. "Katz" means a friend. Georgians are a cultural nation. We first accepted Christianity. Okay, no more. Ours will not go any further, as long as there is an obstacle here. If we could sneak up to the end.... How do you think, Captain? - I think so. I think we have to take it with a gua. We appear at night, we give a sign to understand who we are and ours shall see that we are not evil in our sight, that they may be inflamed before us. Correctly, we have to capture it with "gua", with an assault. Who are you looking for? Do not you know? Tamara Nikolaevna is gone. Where is it? "She went to her husband in Krasnoarmeisk. To your husband? Before the war, she had a man. This is another one. She is a prominent woman. Log in anyway. We'll drink tea. This is my home. I have no one. Guy! Kill! Kill! Guy! Guy! Kill! We, Fury, will fight for them! Guy! Beat them! "Gu-Ga" is not like the "Hände hoch" of the dirty. They will already remember us with this cry from the Black to the White Sea. What is it, Borenka? - It is OK. And I see what I have. Here! - Dumbbell. Here, to be sick you need 40 degrees, but also in the infirmary your sentence remains. - If that were the case, I would have been lying down. We had a medic - Laryonova. Flat, curved legs.... So.... Go. Soup PPP. - What ? "Forgive Sex Life." And I thought it was tea. And I thought it was coffee. - Julien. Before the war, life was good. I get on the train. In white shirt, straight boy. I even had a handkerchief. With space reserved, as appropriate. Nobody can tell you anything. In the morning, through the other door - a briefcase. What about him? - Whom? Whom you stole your suitcase. "And you, by placing parachutes?" Parachutes are casino and may be scrapped. The women from the town carried me in their hands. I secured them with pure silk bras and pants for 100 years ahead, free of charge. - Ivanov, is it true, that you are sentenced to 90 years? - 87. For what? Go up. Quiet.... A prison sentence shall be set aside for the term of imprisonment. Write for the whole company. You know our rules. There they brought a scarf. Go until the slurry is warm. Don't be in a hurry, bro. In a second. Everything should be done without hurry. That is how Suvorov taught. Like this. Bored, did you notice that you didn't vomit today? Don't get used to the smell? - I didn't feel it. And I felt it, but I got used to it. Smells of shit. How many people were here? Everywhere old and new piles. Shit, however, do otherwise. This is your shit, and that's peat. For the landlady. The right eye, as they say in Odessa. You killed the German. And I was wondering why he was looking at it like that? I wanted to give it to him. How did you kill him? - With this. Here, he gets used to the stench, and he cannot with the war. What have you done, scoundrel! At least he had washed it. What, with soap? I don't. And you don't. Hang on. We haven't forgotten you, Shura. What, Slavs? Let us be alive, and the thief die. Guy! "That's it. Come on, go. Come on, Come on! Rules.... Fuck them! Tomorrow we could go home. At least he had advised us. What are you guys doing? This is the basic rule for "penalties": "Everything about the company, nothing for yourself." From Black to White Sea, where do captains and officers sleep? With us. And they can sleep every day in a dry place and bathe with soap. This is the right eye, as they say in Odessa. In Odessa they don't say so. "How come they don't say, Bury?" This word is absolute from Odessa. Marine, am I out of there? It's not from Odessa. They don't speak like that. They really say that. On "Deribasovska" Street.... A friend lives there. Come on. Help me. Oh, that scoundrels! Are you alive? They hit us, took us schnapps. The beam flew over to me so much. They've already found us. There will be no life. Why are you here? Did I order where they should be? I ask you, did I order where they should be permanent? I told them I didn't have to be front line, that the captain does not allow. And they: "Transfer the cans." Don't see them any more here! Your Mammy! - Come on, get out. I was telling you. So, as we agreed. "Everything is ready for me. When the artwork is over, it is important to be in that sector. They brought cans of meat, alcohol, so there would be work, Borrenka. The time is 7:15. - Right. See you soon. Come on! Punchzov, assemble the company. - Commander! We fastened the garnets, we checked out the marshmallow - it's all right. So.... your redemption will be such. The task will be: to take over from the other side. Better both. - Or the three.... And to take over Germany. We will start at dawn. They will calm down until then. Still, we've taught them to wait for us at night. And the most important thing for us is to get stuck and do not ruin until morning. Did you give us alcohol? - And mess. Spirits will have before the fight itself. And for the mess.... I don't advise you if you are injured in your belly. Now the nuances. We will act so.... Hello. - Hello. Dear, watch my machine. Watch the machine. You know? So he understood. Thanks. Dear, tell where the school is? There to the river. The school is next to the river. Thanks. God bless! Boris, you? Fucked! Come on. I will be right back. Father, do you know where the plane is? He says that military arrived by car and one flew on the plane. What will happen to you, Bury? There at Deribasovska, on the corner with "Richelieu" at eight o'clock in the evening news came, that old lady six attackers stole the honour. Guy! Kill! OZ-TOTZ-PORVERTOZ! Grandma - healthy.... Guy! ... and eating a compote, Guy! Ots-Tetz-pervert, and she dreams again.... Guy! ... to flush it. Guy! Kill! Fight, go with the grenade! Bastard! Don't bother me. Fool, I'll show him now! Now, now... Now will you... No! No! - What are you up to, huh? Naughty carrion, you! Watch out, Bury! What have you glazed on? Take the hammer. Curves! Give a hand. Faster! All to the Dusk! Along with them. Go! Go to the dock quickly! Go! All to the Dusk! Dot! Log in! Open it. What a beast! Have not you seen Dankovets? - If you ask, I have seen him soon, not. All the Captain! I counted about 40 people. There are three more. And so... Our firing! "They keep us with fire, gados!" Wait a minute. Dropped Assistant! Swallow Pussy! Wretched suckers! You mourn! Bastards! Now it will begin. Take defence! Did you see Dankovets? - No. What's wrong with them? We agreed. These are our Germans, from the swamp. They immediately stood up. Give. "Panthers". Gados think we're a whole battalion. Did you see Dankovets? - No. Come on, go and bring those with the caps. Sammy will not last long here. - They will not go. Is not their life tired? - Tell me I have ordered. Volodya, they don't care about you. They have another job. Complete the order. Everybody behind! Dot! Captain! Something has happened to the captain. We have to bring it to the bitch. Catch. We're going up. Faster! And what now? Are you the main one? Well? - Now, wait. When they reach the cannon. Dot! - Go on! Go to the dawn. I'm telling you, come in! What is this? Who are these? - Ours. Artillery training. What? - The artwork. Up... Outside. - Out? Outside. Get out! Outside, I said! Fast up! Quick! Up, I said! Out! What are you up to, bastard? Get out! What are you quaking? Up, I said! Get out, quick! Guy! Back! Don't stay. - Listen! Take it. Comrade... Let's go. Do you hear the platoon? It's from Kherson. He was a warehouse keeper in some office. Guy! Hand over the weapon! Hand over the weapon!
