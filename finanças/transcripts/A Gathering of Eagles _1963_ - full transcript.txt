I'm General Kirby. I recognize you, sir. I want to go directly to the command post. You will not notify anyone to let them know we are here. But,sir! - I'll vouch for these men. I'm General Kirby. SAC Inspector General. This is an ORI. A no-notice operational readiness inspection. In seven minutes you will receive a message from Strategic Air Command Headquarters. to carry out a simulated emergency war order. Proceed exactly as you would in a war-time situation. Sir, I'm Colonel Farr, Vice Commanding. May I contact Colonel Brooks? Not until the order comes in. Until then, no one is to be notified. (PHONE RINGS) Carry on. Sorry, can't talk to you now. Call back in ten minutes. ♪ Music ♪ 'This is Jumble, with a Silver Flash message for Moonbeam in six parts.' ♪ Music ♪ ♪ Music ♪ 'Break-break.' ♪ Music ♪ ♪ Music ♪ 'Authentication time is 12/0545 Zulu.' ♪ Music ♪ ♪ Music ♪ Colonel Brooks. Do you wanna act on this? No, not now. Later. Flashlight 35, Sgt Pitudy. Its known ETA is 2030 Zulu. It's General Kirby. I want to talk to General Hewitt, SAC HQ, Omaha. It's Kirby, sir. At Carmody. Doesn't look too good so far. Do you have the bombing scores? Uh-huh. How many aborts? No, that's not good. I'll get back to you. Command Post? Yes, sir? The moment Colonel Caldwell finishes the briefing, send him up to me. Yes, sir Gentlemen, if you'll go right through there, please. If we ever received an order to go, the first step would be to make sure the order was authentic. That it does come from the President. The code which tells us that is inside this red box. The box is never locked. There isn't time to scramble around for a key. However we've taken precautions. Colonel Moore? (ALARM BLARES) Thank you. You'll notice I called my duty controller before I opened the box. Did Gen Hewitt explain our two-man policy? Yes. That's the way it is all the way down the line. The men on duty here are required to wear sidearms. If one man attempted to open that box alone... he wouldn't get very far. Gentlemen, follow me over here, please. Right around here. This is our primary alerting system for transmitting the order down throughout Gen Hewitt's command. Let's assume I'm going to transmit the order to go to war. When I pick up this red phone I'll be in contact with every SAC base in the world. Colonel? (BEEPING) This is Jumble with the communications check. The time is 1750 Zulu. Acknowledge on my count of five One, two, three, four, five. That's how long it would take all combat units to receive ans acknowledge the execution order. They would have 30 seconds to decode and prove the order was authentic. In 15 minutes or less, bombers would be on their way to specific positive control points outside enemy radar. They would not continue on to their targets unless they receive a coded message which corresponds to codes carried in the aircraft. When various members of each crew working individually have properly decoded the message, and arrive at the same answer, Than, and only than will they proceed. Gentlemen, if you'll follow me over here please. Right over there. A certain percentage of our aircraft are always in the air on alert training. They could also be ordered on to their targets immediately., Lord Beresford, select one of the planes from our status board, please. Er. Bozo 23. Bozo 23 You picked a B-52 flying off the coast of North Africa approximately 5,000 miles away. Let's again assume this is the order to go to war. Bozo 23, this is Jumbo Give me a recheck on your fuel reserve. "Roger, Jumbo. Bozo 23. Adequate fuel for destination and alternate." Roger, listening, out. As soon as he authenticated the order he'd be on his way. Any questions? This has been most impressive. "Roger, control, affirmative." How are you doing down the hall, Caldwell? Fine, sir. I'm soaking up a lot of knowledge. Good. Sit down. Thank you. Do you know George Brooks, Wing Commander at Carmody? Yes sir, I checked him out on B-52s when I was instructor pilot. Would you say he Is he a pretty good officer? In my opinion Sir, Yes, One of the best. That's what I thought, or I wouldn't made him Wing Commander. It's just about the toughest job in SAC and he didn't have what it takes. Caldwell, I yanked you out of the London embassy for a job here in HQ. I realize you've hardly been here long enough to get you barrings. but nothing anyone does in SAC means a thing unless every one of our wings is combat-ready. Yes, sir. You want the wing commander's job at Carmody? I certainly do, sir. I believe from your past performance in SAC, you can handle it. You'll get your orders today. Thank you, sir. Good luck. Thank you. (PHONE BUZZES) Go ahead. Is this the London operator? I'm trying to get through to Mrs James Caldwell. Good. Thank you. Jim l Oh, how wonderful to hear your voice. Is everything alright? Everything's great. In fact - Jim, the spinet has finally arrived. You know why it took so long to catch up with us? It was shipped from Zurich in April, eight months after we bought it. Then on to Oslo and it arrived two days after you were transferred back to London. Victoria, listen. I've got a wing. Oh, Jim, how wonderful I'm so happy for you. You remember Hollis Farr, my co-pilot in Korea. He's Vice Commander, my right hand. How's that for luck? That's Marvelous! Jim, I'll be on my way as soon as I can sublet the flat. By the way, where is this wing? Omaha? No. Near San Francisco. San Francisco? Most of the things we own are on their way to Omaha. Well the heck with our things, I can get along without them. I just can't find anyone beautiful enough to send out the laundry. ♪ Music ♪ Well, you don't look half bad for an old man who's been living it up on champagne and caviar. There's nothing like a tour of duty in Europe to broaden a man's education. You haven't changed a bit. Well, shall I summon the battle staff to your palatial new office. Better know what I'm talking about first. That's a good idea. I'll take you to your house. I'd rather stay at the BOQ till Victoria gets here. Alrighty. Col Farr. I have the Wing Commander with me. We're on our way to BOQ. Get a red-phone hooked up there right away. Thank you. Well, now, tell me about Victoria. I struck gold, Hollis. Pure gold. Jet Noise. Well, so you finally wangled your way back into the flying business. Hu It took four long years. They'll have to blast me out of SAC this time. Hollis, what happened to George Brooks? George got clobbered by an operational readiness inspection. The ORI. I thought he was doing just fine till then. Too rough for him, eh? It's not quite the same as when the inspector went around in white gloves looking for dust. They don't give you any notice, you know. A plane lands and out steps Happy Jack Kirby and his inspection team, 30 of 'em. Before you even know there on the base you get a simulated war order from Omaha. From then on, night and day for a week they watch every move you make. If the Wing doesn't have a perfect showing in every department, the Wing Commander ends up as a an air attache in the Galapagos Islands. 51 other wing commanders can hack it. Why couldn't George? You've gotta be hard and ruthless. I don't think George had enough heel in him. I wonder if you do. Maybe I have more in me than you think. Col Farr. Your going to the alert facility with Col Caldwell. ♪ Music ♪ Here we are, Jim. Tankers, bombers, cocked and all set to take off. The alert crews live in here day and night. How long are they kept on alert? Three days and three nights. We used to keep them here for seven days, but it created a morale problem, isolating them from their families for so long, you know. Mmm-hmm. Attention! What's your job, Sgt Kemler? Tanker crew 04, sir. Boom operator. You're on alert? Yes, sir. Suppose the whistle blows, does the rest of the crew wait around while you get your flying boots on? Sir, I keep my boots with the rest of my gear in the aircraft. Sounds like a pretty good system, Sargent. I got enough heel in me, but maybe not enough brains. ♪ Music ♪ They've been identified topside. Let them in. Roger, sir. When George took over, how much did he know about missiles? Oh, about as much as you do. I'd better start boning up. Great. That means you need about 48 hours a day in your new job. Control Center, Missile Squadron Commander. Col Farr is in the access portal with Col Caldwell. Here comes the pitch. They're still sharp and they'll stay that way if I get the support I need. If he had his way, He'd toss base personnel out of their houses, so his troops could move in. Well at least I'd get their barracks in shape. Let's straighten out Bill Fowler so we can get a decent break on priorities, transportation. You can't ask for a better base commander than Fowler. He still thinks everything that flies needs a rudder and a pilot. Let's get into this before the battle staff meeting. Put it off till tomorrow so I can get my bearings. ♪ Ominous music ♪ Quite a bird, isn't it? Yeah. I just hope to God it never has to fly. Col Fowler, Are the missile complexes getting all the support you can give them? Not right now, I'm in the middle of reappraising priorities. Fine, I'd like a detailed report in writing. I'll get on it. In the next 24 hours. Col Josten? .. Yes, sir? I've had a close look at personnel records. How long would it take you to process discharges on these men? Oh, two or three days, sir. I want 'em out of here today. By sundown. I don't want you gentlemen to get the impression that I'm coming in here with a hatchet looking for heads to chop off, but I'll tell you this I expect an immediate improvement in all areas. That's all for now, thank you. Col Garcia. Weren't you a project officer on the B-47? .. Yes Sir, I was. I knew I seen you some where. Good to have you on the staff. Thank you Sir. Come on, I'll but you a cup of coffee. Every man whose records I gave Josten, is below standards. why weren't they fired? We've been waiting for replacements. Waiting, You don't wait for replacements, you go out and get 'em. What's your honest opinion of Josten? He's a damn good man. They're all good men. Best battle staff I ever worked with. George Brooks is a good man too. But the wing flunked the ORI. Have you seen the official report? Uh-uh. Came in this morning. I suggest you take a good look at it before you start chopping off heads. They score you on everything - disaster control, oral exams, written exams, security tests. Two of the men on the battle staff were down with the flu Some of the aircraft were being modified to carry the Hound Dog missile, and we'd just gone operational on the Titan complexes. Happy Jack gives us 15 minutes to get airborne and fly a perfect mission. And we damn near did it. A wing commander with an outstanding record for 22 years gets the chop. - This is Jumbo with a Green Flash message for Moonbeam in six parts. - - Part one... Victor, Quebec, Sierra. - "Part two... Sierra, Alpha, Kilo." - Part three... Juliet, Mike... - (ALARM BLARES) Col Farr with Col Caldwell In mobile, going to the alert pad. This could be the real thing. You never know. This is Ranger control to alert aircraft. Starting roll call. "Ranger 11. "Roger. 11 ready to taxi." "Ranger 23." "Roger. 23 ready to taxi." "Ranger 19." "Roger. 19 ready to taxi." "Ranger 26." "Roger. 26 ready to taxi." "Ranger 15." "Roger. 15 ready to taxi." "Roger. 24 ready to taxi." "This is Ranger control with a Green Flash message." "Break break for alert force - this is a practice quick reaction exercise." "Repeat. Our alert force, This is a practice quick reaction exercise." Three minutes, 20 seconds since the message and they're ready to roll. How long did it take in the ORI? 3.25. Well, at least you got off to a good start. Happy Jack didn't think so, pal. Gen Hewitt wants it done in three minutes flat. Victoria? Hollis Farr. Well, It's Hollis Farr! I'm delighted to see you.. I'm sorry, Jim got trapped with a Senate fact finding. They kind of drop in on him. Oh. Don't worry. He'll probably be free by the time we get to base, Ah! How did you recognize me Mr Farr? Well, I got a few shown to me of more than a couple dozen pictures, but I would have recognized you anyway. You know, I've seen quit a few pictures of you too. My favorite one of you is in a kimono in a Tokyo tea house. Ho, you know what. I totally think I look the best in a kimono. I can hardly wait to hear your version of that evening. Jim? ... Jim? Isn't he here? No. I'll go see if I can pry him loose. Oh, thanks. You must come and dine with us. Any time you say. Thanks, Victoria. Good bye, and thank you so very much. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Welcome to Carmody, Mrs Caldwell. Evelyn Fowler, the Base Commander's wife. Pleased to meet you, Mrs Fowler. Orange marmalade. Made for your breakfast. Did you do all this? If there's anything I overlooked, be sure to tell me. Have you seen the bedroom? Well no,not yet. I'm afraid the curtains aren't the greatest but they are the best I could scrounge. Victoria? We're just next door if there's anything you want. Good bye, and thank yous so much. Jim! Oh, Jim, darling. You finally made it. Col Caldwell, in quarters. That's the red telephone I've read so much about. Mm-hm. And it's mine. That's ours. Please don't ring. Please. It wouldn't dare. I love the house, don't you? I certainly like this room. What's wrong with the others? I haven't seen them. Oh? Roaming around in an empty house without you in it... I missed you enough as it was. You probably want to unpack. Mm-hm. Are you going to help me? Mm-hm. You don't think I'd let you out of my sight, do you? Bring the phone. The red one. You have to stay that close to it? Close enough to answer in six rings. What if you didn't answer it till the seventh? I'd need a good excuse. M..m, I thought your were going to unpack last night. I met a fella. Breakfast is nearly ready. Gosh you're uglier. Thanks. Oh, and thank you for being so considerate. You'd never know you've been away from B 52's. Pretty fair low level bomb run. Let's go upstairs and take on some fuel. See how much you remember about that. Okay. Pilot from Nav. Heading 1 2 0. rendezvous with tanker in 5 6. Ramrod 67, ranger 19. Stabilized in the observation position, ready for contact. Roger. Tanker ready for contact. You're looking good, sir. Forward 10. Up 5. Got your flying boots on, Kemler? Yes, sir. All set to walk home in case anything goes wrong. Stand by for contact. Tanker contact. Contact made. You're in the green, sir. You have fuel flow. Fuel panel check. 20,000 pounds to go, Colonel. Seepage in the refueling line. How bad is it? The line broke! Breakaway! Breakaway! Breakaway! Ranger 19, this is Ramrod 67. What is your problem? It's all over the place. One spark and we've had it. Pilot to crew, shut down all electrical equipment. Broken fuel line. 100% oxygen. Prepare for possible bail-out. "Ranger 19, this is Ramrod 67, what -" Pilot, am unable to contact receiver and have lost him visually. "Ranger control, this is Ramrod 67." "Ranger 19 has just initiated emergency breakaway." "We have lost radio and visual contact." Stand by one. This is Col Farr. Did you encounter any problem refueling prior to breakaway? "Negative. We have no knowledge of their difficulty." See if you can re-establish contact. "Roger, will advise." What's his flight plan? He's due over the base in 20 minutes. Col Farr in the command post. Do you have Ranger 19 on radar? Ranger 19 is 130 miles southeast of base on a track of 315 degrees. I'll be in touch with you. I'm going up in the chase plane. Right, sir. We don't know yet. Get somebody to take your place and get to his wife as soon as you can. Don't tell her anything, Evelyn, but stay with her, just in case. Those fumes are just as heavy below, sir. One spark and this plane blows up. Gotta a helluva a chance of getting one if we lower the gear. This is gunsight. Ranger 19 is now at your ten o'clock position. Turn left 30 degrees. Roger. You're closing nicely. You should have him visually. Roger, Gunsight. Notify the crew, we're lowering the landing gear. The Colonel's going to drop the gear. Oh, brother! He better not get a spark when he does. I'll tell him that! Hold it! T-Bird moving in. Too close. He'd go right up with us. I can't see anything to indicate the nature of the emergency. He still hasn't extended his gear. That could be part of the problem. Alright, lower the gear. Well, we got wheels. I hope we're as lucky with the flaps. We've stretched our luck far enough. We'll go in without them. Our landing speed will be critical. Brakes well be hot, and a spark may explode the fuel. We could blow our tires at any time. Tell the crew when I stop to get the hell out and run. Yes Sir! Looks like he's coming in for a flaps-up landing. Have you alerted all crash equipment. affirmative. It's probably an exercise. You get used to sirens around here. Your air speed's still too high. The best I can do without flaps. 4,000ft marker coming up. 3,000ft. 2,000ft. 1,000ft. Get out before the tires blow! Evelyn, you can go home now. Tell the kids I'll be a little late. I'm buying that crew a drink. What happened, pal? Couldn't find the switch to turn on your radio? Wouldn't this be a perfect time to get hit by an alert. There's plenty of pilots that can handle a chase plane. Next time I'm off this base, you stay close to that phone where you belong! The way she stood by me this afternoon when you were in the air. Not a hint that you were in trouble. She just kept mattering on until she jot word that you were safe. Good evening General, Good evening Jim. May I present my wife? This is General Aymes, our Air Division Commander. How do you do? Welcome to Carmody. and forgive me for being late. Oh not at all, Jim told me how difficult it would be for you to get away. Thank you so much for coming. Mind if I borrow your husband for a couple of minutes? Thank you so much for coming. Mind if I borrow your husband for a couple of minutes? Of course not. Thank you. Hollis tells me you still haven't found out what caused the fuel leak. We will Sir. I have a maintenance crew is working on it now. There you go. Now, where were we, the ORI? The FSP. And by the way, what is it? Family Services Program. Very useful organization. An airman's flying and his wife has to see the doctor and there's no-one to stay with the children. Will what do we do, drive or baby-sit? Both I alternate. Drive to San Francisco one week, baby-sit the next. How do you find time for anything else? There are so many children. SAC has about the highest birthrate in the whole world, including China. Isn't that wonderful? Miraculous, considering how little time the men get with their wives. Colonel. I'll just be a few minutes. Yes, sir. You act like you were never chewed out before. I never was by you. You know I was right. Come on. Come on where? You're due for a refueling. I'm fine. Jim? No, thanks. You did a great job of bringing in that B-52, Jim. Lucky. We're proud of you. I'll be just a few minutes. Jim? Lipstick. Oh. Col Garcia? We've made every check in the book, sir. No defects. I located a spare refueling receptacle. She'll be OK for scheduled takeoff. Good. What happened with the leak in the old receptacle? I don't know, but I'll find out. Col Garcia? Excuse me, sir. Wrong sized bolt on the refueling receptacle. In the mating plans. That's what did it. Rubbed against the drain boss and wore it down. Why wasn't that spotted in the last inspection? We can't check every nut and bolt after every flight. There's no time. We can't jeopardize crews because maintenance has a time problem. I want the receptacle of every B-52 pulled out and inspected. Sir, my men average over 70 hours a week. I hate to crank any more into their schedule. So do I. Good work, Sgt Banning. Thank you, sir. See you in the morning. I hope your men don't have any plans for tomorrow night, like sleeping or anything like that. I'll straighten them out, sir. Bomber crews showed an improvement on your last written tests. But nothing short of perfection is acceptable. There's a limit on the time you can spend on this in a three-day cycle. For that reason, and because of other advantages in training efficiency, the 904th is going back on a seven-day alert as of now. Revised schedules will be distributed this afternoon. That will be all. Get rid of that. Jim, this isn't the answer. When we were on a seven-day alert, morale hit a new low. With a losing team, the way to handle morale problems is to start winning. Have you thought about a five-day alert? Yes... and this morale-booster you sent. These men recommended for promotion - disapproved. Every one of these men are way overdue. If I recommend promotion I'm saying I'm satisfied with the efficiency of this wing. I'm not and I won't be until we pass the ORI. If we don't, take it up with the new Wing Commander. Jim? Jim, it's time to go, dear. Come on. Off the launching pad. Missiles. Er... Jim, the seven-day alert came up at the meeting today. There's a strong feeling of resentment. That's just too bad. Sorry I didn't have a chance to talk it over with them in advance. Look, you red-headed monster, I don't want any trouble out of you tonight. Vic, I know what the seven-day alert does to families and I'm sorry. But I can't consider their feelings right now. There's too much at stake. OK? OK. Hello! Hi. Hi. Can I help? You can be adviser. The forecast is 40% chance of rain. Do we stay inside or risk it? Decisions, decisions. Risk it. I'm outranked. Let's stay outside. (BOTH) Hello. Run along now, girls. And do not stay for the second show. But they say it's one of the best movies... Come back after the show. Yes, ma'am. Oh, Mother! Daddy... Do not stay for the second show. It's not in my service record, but at college I majored in Martinis. I can vouch for these. Bill and I jumped the gun. This is a celebration. Bill Junior was just elected president of staff at Stanford. How wonderful! Congratulations! Can you imagine a slip of a girl like this having a son at college? Bill! Sorry, darling. I, um, just majored in mixing them, not pouring them. Shall we drink to the young president? Bill Junior! To Bill. Morning. Morning, Bill. Morning. Morning. Remember when we used to take 'em off 30 seconds apart? Yeah. Wait till you see these monsters. 15 seconds apart. First one should be rolling in 15. He will be. Tell me about Bill Fowler. He slowed down any? Been too much for him? No. I haven't seen any signs of it. Officers can be carried when they're hanging on for retirement day. Here he comes. Right on the money! Bill's a pretty heavy drinker, isn't he. I've never seen him drunk. Talked to those that have. I've also checked his liquor bills at the club. On the hack, That's the first one off. Check! 14 seconds. Check! He's starting to wobble. Yeh, he was so fast. 16 seconds. Check! There he goes again. I believe it. 16 seconds. See how they veer off. They veer off to the side. Perfect. Here he comes. 14 seconds. Check! They gotta fan out. That was a perfect takeoff. Excellent pattern. Well, you wanted 15 second intervals, plus or minus one. OK? Look, Hollis, I don't want this wing falling on its face because my base commander isn't pulling his weight. How about working off that hostility with a fast game of handball? Look up Sgt Banning, he's a line chief. You want a fast game, Yeh. Look up Sgt Banning, he's a line chief. Is he any good? He'll give you a work-out. Look up Sgt Banning, he's a line chief. Is he any good? He'll give you a work-out. 20 to 4, Sargent. Oh boy,Have you ever played Col Farr? Yeh, once a couple of games. That was enough for him, eh? Well, not enough for me. Ready? I've just got time for a quick steam. They called us an hour earlier today for a disaster control drill. Oh. That's alright. That hard nosed new wing commander's sure pouring it on, isn't he? Sargent, do you feel we're getting the most out of our men? Sir, in my opinion, Col Garcia is the finest maintenance officer in the Air Force. Mmm-hmm. I agree with you. How do your men feel about the freeze in promotions? Three of them have already put out feelers for the outside. Key men? No, sir, their walkers. Walkers? The kind you don't mind losing. When you've got 5 minutes to get one of those beasts off the ground. The men who run their legs off, they're the ones you want to hang on to. It's amazing we have as many... runners as we do. More money on the outside. Easier life. Why did you stay in, Sergeant? Well, sir, I used to be... a pretty slow walker myself. You had to build a fire under my tail to get me to move. Then one day Gen Hewitt dropped in to have a little talk with us. And he built one helluva fire. Only this one wasn't under my tail. He built a fire inside of me. Sergeant, if I'm reading you right, you think I'm building the wrong kind of fires around here. Sir, I'm sure you can judge that better than I can. Stop sparring and level with me. I don't know all the answers. Stop sparring and level with me. I don't know all the answers. If I can't make a man like you see what I'm driving at, the rest of them will never understand and this wing will never get off its back. I need your help, Banning. How about it? Excuse me, sir. I'm... I'm late now. Thanks for the work-out, Colonel. Yeah. Hello, Bill. I ought to be an exhibit somewhere in a glass case. Nobody ever had a cold like this one. Heard you wanted to see me, Jim. I just came back from that Chamber of Commerce luncheon back in town. I must have made a pretty good pitch. They're gonna raise the money for that swimming pool next to the - This just came through. To all key personnel with more than 20 years' service. Any superlatives you like to sprinkle in my case - I can't do it, Bill. I won't recommend keeping you on. What? I can't, even though your past ratings have been excellent. Excellent. Or superior for more than 24 years. Jim, do you know what this means? Involuntary retirement. I'm through. I know. SAC has changed, Bill. It's changed so fast... And you think I haven't? Is that what you mean? Yes. Okay, just give me one example. Missiles?. I've been studying missiles for the last three years, night and day, every spare moment. Surely there must be some other reason... Oh. You, um... think I've been drinking too much, is that it? That's it. Did it interfere with my efficiency? Am I ever drunk on duty? You're the one that mentioned drinking, why do you bring it up? Have I ever let you down? You might, Bill. You might at just the wrong time. Have I ever let you down? You might, Bill. You might at just the wrong time. What am I gonna do? I've been in the Air Force all my life. The Air Force is my life. But Jim. Jim, you could have me transferred. You still can. In a few more years I'd be able to draw full retirement. I'm sorry Bill, just I can't give you a phony rating and pass you on to another commander. Jim... ♪ Downtrodden Music ♪ I've just been with Evelyn. Jim, how could they do that to Bill. After 24 years? I know. It's rough. He couldn't adjust to it, that's all. I'm wondering how will he adjust to civilian life? He won't have any trouble finding a job. A Job. At his age, to start all over. And if Bill Jr. has to leave college... You can't see how, but it was something that had to be done. Did it have to be done in that way? To rip a man's life to pieces in one stroke. Five lives. Jim, couldn't you do something? Couldn't you put a word in for him, speak to Gen Aymes? Vic... Couldn't you put a word in for him, speak to Gen Aymes? Vic... I'm the one who said he had to go. You? Yes. I had no choice. You smash a man's life without one word of warning? You don't get any warning in this business. You smash a man's life without one word of warning? You don't get any warning in this business. It's my job is to have this wing ready for any emergency. Is the job everything? Don't people matter at all? Doesn't warmth and friendship? Jim, what's happened to you? I'm not running a rehabilitation center! If I haven't made that clear to you by now.. No you haven't. I didn't know you could be so callous. Drops it. Al right than. .. Let's drop it.. There are enough people in SAC questioning every move I make, without getting it from you. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Just wanted to borrow the chair. Good morning, Colonel. Mind if I sit down? I wish you would, Sergeant. Thank you. The cook must've walked through the potatoes. They taste good today. Yes, sir. You sure you've got a ride back to the base? Positive. My sister is picking me up. You sure you've got a ride back to the base? Positive. My sister is picking me up. Thanks so much, Mrs Caldwell. Oh, konichiwa, Victoria-san. Konichiwa? (SPEAKS JAPANESE) Speaking Japanese What does that mean? Where's the tea house? It's the only full sentence I know. I think we better skip the translation. What are you doing for lunch? There's a wonderful restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf. I was going back to the base. I'll toss in a free tour of Chinatown. I'd love to Hollis, but...Ah (BELL PINGS) I'll toss in a free tour of Chinatown. I'd love to Hollis, but...Ah (BELL PINGS) And a ride on the cable car. OK. OK. Hollis, have you seen the Fowlers? No. They found a great apartment. View of the bay. Just what they wanted. That was a rough one for Jim, Vicky. It's not the first time a wing commander's had to fire a friend. But you have to respect a man strong enough to set aside his feelings. Was Jim always like this and I just didn't see it? Or is he forcing himself to live up to his image of a wing commander? It's not just his image. You've known him a long time. Is it Jim or the job? It's the job. There wasn't a pilot in Korea who wouldn't welcome a chance to serve in Jim's squadron. Not that he was a soft touch. He was as hard as nails when he had to be. When the pressure was off... But when you're a wing commander the pressure's never off. I didn't think he had that kind of... toughness. Hollis, It's a side of him I've never seen before. Col Caldwell in quarters. Sorry, Vic. It wasn't my fault. It was Robert H Goddard's. Who's he? He invented ballistic missiles in World War I. But for him they wouldn't have the Titan, and I'd have been here two hours sooner. Do I have time for a drink? Let's celebrate the earliest you've ever been late. Where did that come from? That? That's from your absentee husband. Jim! Where did you find time? Oh, I saw an ad in a magazine. It's quite a, er, fig leaf, isn't it? It's absolutely gorgeous. I love it. It's absolutely gorgeous. I love it. It's so sheer. I believe in protecting my property without obstructing the view. I can save it for a really special occasion. OK. Here. The Russian Ballet! Any four-alarm fires? No, sir. It's been real quiet. Gen Aymes wants you to call. Get him, please. Jim? This just came in from SAC headquarters. They want a detailed report. Thank you. Tell Col Farr I want to see him. Yes, sir. Col Caldwell in quarters. Do you like it? You know I do. No, the coiffeur. It took me all afternoon. It's wonderful, Vic Ann told me about a marvelous after-theater place, Just in case you didn't have time to research on San Francisco nightspots before I arrived. Or did you? Don't answer that. I can't leave the base tonight, Vic. I've a report to get in by midnight. Don't explain. L-I'm sure it couldn't be helped. It won't always be like this. It's bound to level off somewhere. Then we can... Yes, I know. I spoke to Hollis. He's free tonight, and I thought may be the two... What's it gonna be, Ann Morse's' place or The Top Of The Mountain? I really think it's too late. Do you mind Hollis? Do. Not at all. Evelyn! Hello, Victoria. I've missed you. I've missed you too. How's Bill? He's fine. Except for a cold that kept him home on a night we were looking forward to for months. Hollis. Evelyn, how are you? How nice to see you. Bill! Col Farr. Bill, this is Mrs Caldwell. How do you do? I've heard so much about you, Bill. How are you getting on at Stanford? I don't go there any more. He's going back next year. He thought a year of practical chemistry work... This wonderful opportunity came along, a job in a lab, here in town... I'll get the car. I'll go with you. See you soon, Victoria. We must get together. Bye. Bye. Bye. OK? You got it, while I check the deicing equipment. Fire on number six. Emergency check list. Close throttles. Pull firewall switches. Sir, theirs a phone call for you. It's urgent. Col Caldwell. Bill Fowler shot himself. They say it was an accident. He was cleaning a gun. Well, how bad is he? I don't know. I'm going to be with Evelyn. I'll be right over and drive you. I don't think that would be a very good idea. I'll call you later. He's got a fighting chance. He's going to be alright. He's got so much to live for. I thought I knew him so well. But this... ...just doesn't seem possible. I can only believe it was an accident. Things have been building up in Bill for years. You see ... he was a great combat leader. Ask any of the older men. He was once the youngest command pilot in the Air Force. Then everything changed. Missiles... the red phone... The constant pressure day in, day out. It was just too much for him. But for years he's been at the top of the promotion list. And everyone but Bill knew he'd never get his first star. He should've retired years ago. Instead, he... ...he majored in Martinis. You listen to me Victoria, Don't ruin your life or Jim's by blaming him. It was bound to happen. If it hadn't been Jim... it would've been something else. Col Caldwell, in quarters. How is he? No change. Did I guess right with the scrambled eggs, or would you like something else? No they're fine, Want some milk? No, thank you. I think we ought to talk this out Vic. So do I. Jim, I'm sorry that I felt that you were callous. It was unfair of me. I know it's the job, and I know how important the job is. But why you? There are people better-suited. It wouldn't go against the grain with them. It doesn't with me. It does. I don't care how much you deny it. It does. Let me tell you something, Vic. if I thought I was the wrong man for the job I'd step out right now. But I don't think so, and it's up to me to give it all I've got. Bill Fowler gave it all he had. He just didn't know when to stop pushing himself. Will you know? Yes. If that time ever comes, I'll now before anyone else, and won't have to be told what to do about it. In other words, you don't want to discuss it. I do want to discuss it! Jim, I want you to put in for another assignment. There are jobs in SAC just as important. Well, at least give me a chance to have a fair crack at this one. Sure it's tough. It's tough on both of us now. When this wing gets back om its feet it'll be entirely different. So will you. You've changed so much already I hardly know you. Jim, I wish you'd think about putting in for another assignment. Will you? Yeah. I'll think about it. Thank you. Has Hollis ever told you why he never got married? Well... no. No, he hasn't. Because he's a coward. It takes a brave man to look his wife in the eye night after night and say, "Sweetheart, I got a call from the command post and I have to leave." Carry on, my love. I'll muddle through. One day, I'm gonna say, "Honey, let's go to Lake Tahoe for the weekend." How'd you like that? I'd adore it. Good. We'll do it. The Jostems have offered to take you home. Or I could drop you off now. Which would you prefer? Well, if you don't mind, I think I'll stay on a bit. Alright. I'll try to come back if I can. I like your hair that way. ♪ Here at SAC the florid cry, there's just one thing we can't deny which we get clobbered by..An enemy attack, or ORI. ♪ ♪ Our wing commander got a racket, tho sometimes it's hard to hack it\s ♪ ♪ When ever he gets his wife alone.. dig aling aling on that little red phone. ♪ ♪ Oh we'll be on a seven day alert, for a week we will not see a skirt ♪ ♪ So we know it's part of SAC's main goal... to test our partners tail control. ♪ ♪ Absence makes the heart grow fonder, what ever became of the will blue yonder ♪ ♪ How we wish the good old days.. were back in SAC! ♪ Can I have your attention, I just received a message from Col Morgan at the Command Post He's leaving for his quarters immediately, and he's like us to come over there eat him out of house and home. Coming with us Victoria I can drive Victoria... Fine! Is Jim going to join us I don't think so.. See you at the Morgans. What's the matter? When I ran into the BX the other day, we got two or three looks like that, Did you notice? Oh don't worry, it ridiculous. Never the less.. Never the less. Alright, I can drop you off at the Morris's, and they can drive you home. I don't think I will go Hollis. Do you mind dropping me off on the way? Alright. Banning. Colonel. How are you? Don't you ever go home? Why? All I got at home is a wife and five kids! Least it was five last time I counted. Excuse me, sir. What's the problem? Oh, it's nothing serious. What's the problem? Oh, it's nothing serious. Well, what's Col Garcia doing here? He was up all night last night on a check flight. I know, sir. We have standing orders to call him whenever there's a problem, no matter how small it is. Excuse me No sweat, Colonel. Spotted the trouble just after I called you. Looks OK to me. Evening, Colonel. Joe. I think I've found one reason why maintenance has a time problem. What is it? You. You're here as an executive not a mechanic. You're supposed to train airmen and officers to do their job, not do it for them. You're trying to pitch, catch and play first base at the same time. And that's what slowing them down! You're trying to pitch, catch and play first base at the same time. And that's what slowing them down! You belong in the command post or in your office unless there's a major emergency. And in your bed when you're out on your feet the way you are now. No Sir. If I can't run my department the way I think I ought.. Now, sir, if I can't run my department the way - No Sir. If I can't run my department the way I think I ought.. Now, sir, if I can't run my department the way - Joe. Go on home and get some sleep. Now, sir, if I can't run my department the way - Joe. Go on home and get some sleep. We'll talk about it in the morning. Alright. Right. Bye-bye. Hi. Hi. Garcia told me about the chewing out you gave him last night. I wouldn't exactly call it a chewing out. You don't know old Smoky Joe. He wants a transfer to B-58s. Oh, come on! Smooth his ruffled feathers and talk him out of it. I don't wanna talk him out of it unless he develops a back-up system. Suppose he gets sick or has an accident. Maintenance would be bogged down. If an ORI hits... This is where I came in. I got that speech from Brooks. What happened? Convince him he was wrong? I pointed out he'd have a king-sized morale if he replaced Garcia. His men think the world of him. So do I. But he can't do everything himself. You'd go a long way before you'd find anybody as good. He'd be a more effective if he'd learn how to delegate authority And he's going to! What about this request for transfer? I never saw it. Ah..Come on. You stall around on this all he'll do is go to the inspector general. Why go out on a limb? Out on a limb?! How the hell do you think I've been living since I took this job? What's wrong with going out on a limb, Hollis? Don't get excited, I didn't mean it that way. Well I'd like to know exactly what you did mean! You should be careful the way you handle it. Leave it to me. If somebody saws off the limb it'll be my neck, not yours l "Ranger control, this is Boxcar 30, over." I'd like to see your flight orders and tomorrow's crews. Yes, sir. "...break break, silver-toned hotel... Break break." Thank you. "Authentication time is 06/0130." "Roger. Copied your traffic. Boxcar 30, out." Who authorized that leave? Col Farr. Gen Aymes come back from the Titan Complex yet? Yes, sir, he's at the missile assembly building. "Runway temperature is 85 degrees Fahrenheit." Gen Aymes, there's something I'd like to discuss with you before you leave. I'm just about set to take off. What is it, Jim? Can we use your office? Of course. I'm just about set to take off. What is it, Jim? Can we use your office? Of course. I wanna replace Hollis Farr. Why? What's happened? Are we in shape in the electronic squadron to give Commander a leave? I wouldn't say so, no. Hollis Farr gave him a leave. You're going to fire him for that? No, not just for that. General, you're on top of three wings. You don't have time to take off the cowling and look at nuts and bolts. That's my job in the 904th. And I've finally found the monkey wrench. Why was maintenance below par in the last ORI? And low-level bombing, alert crew exams, air refueling? Because Hollis Farr was winning friends and losing efficiency with a relaxed training program, an eight to five work day, a policy geared to normal times. I inherited the most popular vice commander in SAC, but one who will not assume responsibility. Friend or no friend, he's out, John. Unless you override me. You have a replacement in mind? Mike Stanley, at the Air War College. Up for reassignment next month. OK, it's your wing. I'll move Hollis out as soon as Stanley can take over. Of course, you know what this'll do to his career. Maybe a good swift kick like this is exactly what he needs. Might straighten him out. I just wonder if your timing is good. Because of the ORI? No. Because you might have personal reasons. There's been talk Jim. About Hollis and Victoria. Even the grapevine around here is below par. (PANTS) I can't run a wing on what people think. I want him out of here. OK, Jim. Alright, the low-level bombing on this mission was red-hot. One after the other. As far as air refueling, if those tankers were giving out trading stamps, you'd all have a few books. Now - I'd like to say a few words. I don't share Col Farr's enthusiasm about this mission. Based on weight and weather, your B-52 performance charts called for a take-off roll of 8,000ft. Not 9,000, which three of yours took. You're using improper technique and you're slow in getting up. It's burning up time, which is our enemy. What the hell good is bombing accuracy if enemy missiles can knock the bombers out before they take off? Major Jarvis? Yes, sir? You're a lone man on this mission, was there any problem with the plane? No, sir. From now on, any crew that fails to measure up, goes back on training status until they can demonstrate desire proficiency. Are there any questions? That'll be all. Dismissed. What the hell got into you? You chopped my legs out from under me! How do you expect to have authority? I don't. You're fired. I'm what? I talked to Gen Aymes. I'm replacing you. Are you gonna tell me why I've been fired or is that asking too much? My job is to get this wing on its feet, anything that - Ah quit the lecture and get to the point! I intend to. It's been one big happy family, hasn't it? Division's good. Tell Hollis Farr, he'll OK a leave. You don't like the seven-day alert, tell Hollis Farr, he aims to please. He's not out on a limb. Let the wing commander stick his neck out. Be vice commander until something cushier turns up. And don't ever get in the spot where they can turn the heat on you. It's about time somebody did. If a man can't stand heat, stay out of the kitchen. You know, I said you didn't have enough hell in you to be wing commander, You've got enough for the entire air force. What time are the Josten's due? I canceled dinner tonight. I said I had a headache. Good. I'm afraid I wouldn't be very good company anyway. Col Caldwell in quarters. I see the spinet finally arrived. Looks good over here, doesn't it? Yes. Well, when are you going to ask me? Ask you what? If there's any truth in the rumors about Hollis and me. I think you know me better than that. No. I don't really know you at all any more. It's like... like living with a stranger. I don't fit into this life, I've got to get away and think things out. Where would you go? I'm not sure. Home, London There's a boat leaving on the 20th. Are you sure that's what you wanna do? Yes. I'll get you something to eat. First we'll review the latest safety procedures in the Hound-dog. Prior to our scheduled drop, the positive locking device will not be unlocked till the aircraft is over the range on the run. If the release it not accomplished, the release systems will be locked prior to departure... The broken arrow exercise at 4B went off very well, General. Sorry I couldn't get there. I went into town to see Bill Fowler. The broken arrow exercise at 4B went off very well, General. Sorry I couldn't get there. I went into town to see Bill Fowler. How is he? Any improvement? Physically, but the fight's drained out of him. Winston Aircraft offered him a good job, he's not interested. Yes, I know, we've all dropped in to see him. If something doesn't happen to snap him out of this, he's licked. Come in. Hello, Bill. How you doing? I thought I'd drop in, see how you're getting along. Nice room. I, um... (SIGHS) I've been meaning to read this book. Any good? (SIGHS) Well... If there's anything I can do... let me know. I hear you've been using the hatchet again. Chopping off more dead wood. Who's next after Hollis? Do you have it worked out in advance or do you play it by ear? That's one hell of a system. Next division commander, then 15th air force headquarters in Omaha. You might just chop your way right to the top. The youngest four-star general in air force history. I'll tell you what's wrong with your system. Men do their best for leaders who inspire them, Not for hatchet men. That's why General Hewit always stood out, he and all the other who made it. They they got hatchets, but when they chop when they know it's dead wood cause they know how to judge men. You can't even judge yourself! What makes you think you know who's got it and who hasn't? I sure as hell had you pegged. You couldn't even do a good job of blowing your brains out! Just a minute! Do you think I'm washed up, huh? I've got a job waiting for me. A good job. Before I'm through I'm gonna make you choke on every word of this. Get out of here. Who's he visiting? Are you Col Caldwell? Yes. There's a call for you. Col Caldwell. Col Josten. Tower has unidentified KC135 on final approach. No emergency declared. Smells like an ORI. Notify all members of the battle staff. I'll be there in 20 minutes. "(TV NOISE)" (PHONE RINGS) Col Farr. You sure it's Kirby? I don't know but you'd better get over here just in case. Remember, you're the store keeper till the boss gets back. I'm on my way. This is an ORI. An no-notice Operational Readiness Inspection. In 9 minutes, headquarters SAC will dispatch a fast-reaction message to test your readiness to launch aircraft and missiles in a maximum of 15 minutes. And to check your effectiveness in carrying out a simulated emergency war order. No-one is to be notified until the order comes in from SAC. Carry on with what you were doing. (PHONE RINGS) (ALARM SOUNDS) "This is Jumbo with a silver-flash message for Moonbeam in six parts." "Break break. Part one... Papa, Kilo, Zulu..." "Part two, Sierra, Tango, Hotel." "Part three..." Command post. This is Col Caldwell. Is it Kirby? Stand by, one. This is Col Farr. "Bravo, break break." "Authentication time is 23/0655 Zulu." Affirmative. It's the ORI. Keep me posted. I'll be there as soon as I can. (ALARM SOUNDS) (ALARM CONTINUES) (SIRENS) (ALARM SOUNDS) "Prepare a simulated launch on all missiles." "Attention all personnel, prepared a simulated launch on all missiles." This is Ranger control to all alert aircraft. Starting roll call. Ranger 11. "11, ready to taxi." Ranger 23. "23, ready to taxi." Ranger 19. "Roger. 19, ready to taxi." "Ranger 25." "25, ready to taxi." - Ranger 13.- "Roger. 13, ready to taxi." - Ranger 18. "Roger. 18, ready to taxi." Ranger control. Ranger 11, ready to roll. 11, you're cleared for take off. "Full power coming up, five seconds. Four, three, two, one." "Ranger 15." "Ranger 24." 14 seconds, so far so good. "Ranger 27." "Ranger 25." Ready to raise launcher number one on my mark. Ready? Mark. "Ranger 21 cannot get full power on number six engine. Ranger 21 cannot get full power on number six engine." Maintenance control, get over to 21 right away. That's all the power you're gonna get on number six, 80%. That'll knock us out of the box. Ground abort. It wouldn't even add 1,000 feet to the take-off roll. They'll flunk us on the whole ORI. Any improvement? No, sir. 80%. Give me the command post. Col Farr, the command post is in contact with Col Caldwell. Anything you wanna talk about? Negative. Ranger control. Ranger 21, negative. We're simulating war-time conditions. Linke, go. Ranger control, ranger 21 ready to roll. Roger, 21. You're clear to go. Keep a close check on number six. If it drops below 80% at the decision point, we'll abort the mission and clear the runway. 8,000 foot marker coming up. Number six engine, 80%. 7,000 foot marker coming up. Speed 112 knots. Decision point coming up. Now. We're committed. We're losing power in number six. Shall I shut it down? Negative! We've past the refusal point. 3,000 foot marker coming up. No improvement on number six. Speed 150 knots. Lift-off point now. "Ranger control, that is affirmative. You have six more aircraft to go." Command post. This is Col Caldwell. I'm on my way to the flight line. Ranger 18's at the end of the runway with engine trouble. Roger. We got less than three minutes to get him off! Easy does it, Sergeant. Thank you, Colonel. "18, you'll be the last to take off. One minute 55 seconds to roll." How does it look? They found it yet? "We're working on it." I got one minute and 50 seconds before they score me as an abort. - Try it now. - - Try it again. - 18, 50 seconds. How you looking? "We're OK. Button her up, I'm taking off. That's what I call cutting it close. Just so we cut it, that's all that counts. Sorry to get you out in the middle of the night. We thought the Wing Commanders wife would like to be present during an ORI. Is there anything I can do? Well the patient in 712 is having a bad night. Do you play gin-rummy? I can learn. We got them all off with 20 seconds to spare! That sure was a cliff hanger. This is your first ORI, isn't it? Yes Sir. Let me tell you something Sargent, Were still hanging. And we will be during air refueling, bomb runs, and ever other phase of the mission for the next 14 and a have hours. See how the coffees holding out well you Sargent? Yes Sir! Would you care for a cup of coffee Col? Don't mind if I do. Thank you Sargent. I sent up a plane with 80% power on one engine. A B-52? Yes. 21. I know it's against peace-time regulations but I decided there was no risk involved. Operations normal so far on 21? Yes Sir. Alright, say it. Say I was wrong. I don't know how Kirby'll going to score it. Alright, say it. Say I was wrong. I don't know how Kirby'll going to score it. But at least you finally stuck your neck out. "This is Ranger 15. Our radar is inoperative. Repeat. Our radar is inoperative." This is Col Caldwell, have you checked everything in the dash one? "Yes, sir, we have. And in the maintenance manual." "Our radar's completely out, request further instruction." Keep trying. "We've tried everything in the book." "It's impossible to repair it in flight." Who's his radar operator? Truebeck. He's the best there is. Alright, proceed on course, then fly the rest of the route as briefed. "Roger. 15." Well, that's one abort. Yeah, and two flunk." Let's not have the wake yet. Jorsten, let me have a look at the flight plan. Yes, sir. - Ranger control, 21.- "Roger, 21. Go ahead. Refueling completed as scheduled. - Ranger control, 21.- "Roger, 21. Go ahead. Refueling completed as scheduled. Encountered light to moderate turbulence. It's in the green. Roger, 21. Have a good flight. "Ranger control, this is Ranger 27, over." This is Ranger control. Go. "Ranger 27, in the refueling area. Encountering extremely heavy turbulence." Disconnect, we'll try it again. "I've had several disconnects." "I do not think I can get my full fuel load in the required time." How much fuel have you taken on, 27? "Almost half the predefined load." Have nine minutes left to take on the rest. Ranger 27, this is Col Caldwell. If you feel the risk is excessive, you're clear to return to the base. There goes the ball game. I think I can hack it, sir. I'd like to try once more. OK, but play it safe. Remember, this is a peace-time exercise. (BUZZER) 101, do you mind, Mrs Caldwell? Oh, no, not at all. An appendectomy. He came out of it just fine. His wife has been notified if that's what he wants to know. His name is Kemler. Sgt Kemler. Cam you make a call for me, please? Your wife's been notified. What? Oh! The call I want is to, er, air refueling operations. Would you ask them how Ramrod 67 did in the ORI? Will you, ma'am? I'd be glad to. Extension 1021. Hello, I'm speaking for Sgt Kemler from the base hospital. No, he's fine. No complications. He was anxious to know how his plane - Tell him the whole damn squadron made it, Mrs Kemler. Oh, sorry, Mrs Caldwell. All bombers received maximum on-load in the specified time. I'll tell him. Bye. What did he say? The whole damn squadron made it. Wonderful. I'm Mrs Kemler. May I go and tell him? Just exactly what the patient needs. Room 101. Thank you. "This is 26. I'm the last one down at 34 after the hour." "Roger, 26." (CHATTERING) Morse. Any aborts? One. And one that can go either way. Want some coffee? Thanks, but in moderation. Not more than 20 cups a day. There's one guy I never thought I'd be rooting for. He's getting the bomb scores. Yep. Thanks. General. There's nothing we can do about it now. Good morning, sir. Morning. Get any sleep? No, sir. I got in a couple of naps. That does it for me. A 10 or 15-minute nap and I'm OK. It's remarkable how little sleep a man can get along with if he has to. It certainly is, sir. I'm glad to hear that, sir. Col Farr you're aware of the peace-time rule against sending up an aircraft without full power? Yes, sir. Sir, we were simulating war-time conditions. I would've made the same decision. So would I. And I'm not gonna score it as an abort. We're in. He didn't even mention the bombing scores. I guarantee they're great. Listen, He smiled at you. When Happy Jack smiles at a wing commander it's like giving him the Airman of the Year award. You could've contacted me last night before you sent that plane up. Yes, I could've. Couldn't I. How did you like it out there on that limb? Gets, er, kinda breezy, doesn't it? It sure does. You stay with it... pal. You might even get to like it after a while. I think I'll go get some sleep. Good morning. I hear it's going very well. Yes, it is. I'm glad. I was worried when I heard that you weren't here at the start. My first trip to San Francisco. Wouldn't you know? How is Bill? Bill's going to be just fine. Col Caldwell in quarters. It's a good thing they don't score you on your home life. I'd fall flat on my face. It isn't just you, it's everyone in SAC. There was an airman at the hospital. Do you know the first thing he asked about when he came round? His wife or his children? No, he wanted to know how his plane did in the ORI. I know it doesn't make sense to you, but if you spend a lifetime in SAC - But he hasn't. He's still in his 20s. I met his wife too. She doesn't think he's... different or callous. She understands. I wish I had. Gosh, you're ugly. (PHONE RINGS) Col Caldwell's quarters. It's for me. Yes. Yes, of course. No, it won't take a moment to get there, General Kirby. Goodbye. He wants to see me about the family services program. I'll be back as soon as I can, dear. You'll have to learn to live with these things in SAC.
