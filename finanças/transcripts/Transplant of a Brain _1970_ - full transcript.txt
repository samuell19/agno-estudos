-Where's Sir Cliffton? -I don't know Milady. -Hello Susan, Where's Cliff? -I'm also looking for him. EXCUSE me for a moment. Dear, I hoped your brother had come as well. -He's on guard duty at Buckingham Palace. -God save the Queen. -I'll tell him. -A great party. -E> - Excuse me. Have you seen Cliff? Again? You keep losing your husband. Try a dog collar. That'll do. Maybe I should spank him. -Yes, but not too hard. Dorothy, have you seen Cliff? You asked me the same question last saturday at Lady Ariel's party. -Oh my dear. -You gave a great speech yesterday. -Thank you. -No, no, thanks I'm already full. I'll be right back. -How are you Penny? -Fine, thanks. -Your boutique is doing well. -I can't complain. But... I thought he was here with you. Cliff? We were talking but he left. -What shenaningan are you up to this time? -Nothing. Peter... just tell me. I think I'd better not. Maybe I'm just exaggerating and I don't want to scare you for nothing. -Scare me? —It‘s Cliff. -He's working too much -And? -I don't want to worry you Susan but... all these sudden headaches... you know, I'd have him see a doctor. -Do you think I haven't tried? All in vain. -You have to insist Susan. You know him well. Have you tried to change his mind over anything? -He's very ill. First of all, you must convince him that he is very sick and needs medical help. -Please, do it in my place. -You think I haven't tried? -What did he say? -He didn't even let me finish. I guess I wasn't persuasive enough. Maybe it's better if he doesn't find us here talking. You're right. And I can't keep the guests waiting. -Hey listen Cliff. I'd really like to get engaged with a young lady of good family. -Is this a good enough reason to strangle my wife? -It would be a clear case of legitimate defense. -Have you heard him, dear? -Speaking of wifes... -Oh, my husband's finally here. -I was about to launch an emergency radio broadcast. -Don't forget about television, my dear. -C|iff, listen... -No, he raped the girl and then he killed her. He's an evil being, he must be eliminated. He's only a twenty year old boy, a drug victim. -Yes, he's a murderer, alright but he's also an ill person, he's not prejudiced and there was no premeditation. I'll tell you one thing, I wish I could condemn him to death. -These are the times I regret I voted for the abolishment of the capital punishment. -Alright Cliff. If you don't want to take account of all the circumstances at least hear what the psychiatrist has to say. That poor girl died, and the scoundrel that brutally killed her must pay. It's useless to keep talking about it. You're never going to change your mind. Yes, you're right. But my opinion is supported by facts. Peter! What are you doing here? -Mr. Ruff, law attorney McLaine. -Nice to meet you. -Think about it Cliff. -Good morning. -Your honor, I'm asking you out to lunch. -Accepted. -I have to talk to you. -And1'll listen. Welcome home stranger. You look tired my dear. I am.Peter came to the tribunal and I had lunch with him. Don't pretend to be surprised because I know you sent him. Why do you want me to go to a doctor? -But1 don't know what Peter... -Oh, just spill the beans. What's wrong about two people who love you trying to convince you to see a doctor? -What matters is that you're going. -I don't have the time. And they're only headaches, you're just making a fuss about it. -C|iff! -All right, I'll go. I promise. Do you know what's my real problem? The job I do. I wish I were an engineer, or a professor. I'm sure a lot of crooks wish the same. -C|iff? Sir Cliffton? Are you feeling sick? -I'll bring him some water. -Call a doctor, now. -No, Charlie, it's nothing serious. Sir Cliffton. I want to be really honest with you. I know you always refuse medical examinations. Maybe because of a sort of instinct, because you wanted to escape from something. Just get to the point. Yes. You were afraid of the truth, you didn't want to know it. It's human. Sometimes the truth is ruthless, and bitter. This is something a judge should know as well as doctor, am I right? Then tell me this truth. I'm sure you also have some hesitations when you're about to condemn a poor devil who's sure of his own innocence. What do you do in these cases? Justice balances rights and wrongs. I absolve or condemn accordingly. What am I supposed to do? Have you ever had a doubt? Only once, years ago. A death penalty case. How much he cried... And in my case nothing ever balances. The verdict is always unfair. You already know what I have to tell you. I tried to prepare you. IfI understood correctly I have very little time left to live. How much? A few years? Or less? Months? Yes. I wanted you to be the first to know, I didn't even tell your wife mainly because there's still a chance. You don't have to lie to me, doctor. Transplants are revolutionizing the medical science. At the Royal Foundation Hospital we performed a brain transplant on a monkey. The experiment was a complete success. Of course we never tried on a human being but you could be the first case, Think about it. If you want to give it a try I'm ready. - There's no other cure, right? - Exactly. It's your only hope. - Hello - At least you're getting some rest. - What are you reading? Mickey Mouse? Something more appropriate. It's funny how people change when they're about to die. Don't say that Cliff! After all Susan I can't ask more from life. What nonsense. People also used to think heart transplants were impossible, instead... The heart is a muscle that pumps blood it's different than having a different brain. Don't torment yourself. Professor Chalmers is so confident about the success of the operation. You'll see. IfI accepted it's only for one reason. You can't stop scientific progress. Somebody has to be the guinea pig. Thank you Inspector. -Vittorio Lamberti? -Yes. -As far as we know you are the only relative of the victim. -Yes. I am professor Chalmers. Your brother has a few hours left to live. He's not going to make it. -I have to talk with you. -I'd rather have this conversation some other time. I understand but it's not something that can be postponed. Your brother's death could save another man's life. I should'nt have gotten involved! My dear, you're so unimaginative. Why don't you think about the whole thing once again? It's not hard. Your brother was more dead than alive. Are you St. Anthony? Not at all. You weren't going to take him back from the dead. You saved a judge's life instead. And a second hand judge is as good as new. You only have to go to him and collect your rich reward. What if he's... You know nothing about judges Do you think they'll buy anything without paying? If someone's hungry and steals a loaf of bread they lock him up in jail. Think about someone stealing a brain. And we're not even considering the desecration of your brother's corpse. Just hope that operation is successful. Then you'll talk about it. And keep in mind he was your only brother. You won't have another chance like this. - I didn't mean to kill her! I loved her.I already knew she slept with other men. Liar! My daughter, she was a child! It wasn't her fault. That's just the way she was. Life sentence. Thirty years. Absolved. Death sentence. Fifteen years. Everything's fine so far. Do you really think that? The hardest part is over. - The hardest part starts now. - The operation was a success, what are you afraid of? We're still talking about an experiment professor. What is commonly accepted nowadays was nothing but theories a few years ago. The only thing that matters is that science is fighting to save your husband's life. - I know. Mariella. Idon't know why but I like the sea a lot more than the land. And you? Don't be shy, answer. Ginetto... On top of a foamy wave, my heart's running running away from me. Do you know this one? -I don't remember ifI learned it in school or I wrote it myself. -You're a bit crazy. Have you ever dreamt about flying above the sea like a seagull? -And you? -Of course! -Do you really have to leave? -I'll be back soon. -But why? -To make some money, so we can buy a boat. Our boat. - So you're leaving for a boat? - For our future together. Don't go. Sir Cliffton is alive. Sir Cliffton is alive. Sir Cliffton is alive. Ishouldn't have let them do it! It's all your fault! It's the most intelligent thing you've ever done in your life. Ididn't do it for the money, after all. That's obvious. That's a mistake we can fix. Even an imbecile can't act like an imbecile every single time. Do you want me to set up a plan or do you want to improvise? You decide. The problem now is how to get paid by a judge for the brain of a deceased brother. -Let's talk about your brother then... -No, cut it out! -You welcomed him in your house with open arms! -Stop it! -You think he wouldn't help you? He doesn't need his brain anymore! -For the last time... At least he used his brain when he was alive, unlike you... -Sorry. -Get your hands off me! Do it again and I'll kill you. I'll try to explain in the easiest way. I want to help you understand the problem. Understand and resolve, inspector. -In our case... —Excuse me professor. In our case we're not dealing with an organ with limited function. -We're talking about a brain. A part of a brain with all its feelings, sensations, ideas. That's why we need your cooperation inspector. Here in London but also in the rest of the country. We need to know every detail about the life of the donor. We must monitor sir Cliffton, the new sir Cliffton that from now on will live with someone else's memories. And keep the activity of his new brain under strict control. We have already begun professor. Vittorio Lamberti. Older brother of the donor. Immigrated here in 1963. Six years later his little brother Ginetto arrived from Sicily with a tourist visa. -And how did he manage to stay here? -He was a young, nice fellow. A girl of the immigration office had a crush on him and he obtained a temporary permit. What was his job? He worked at the docks. As you know italians are hard workers. His bosses talked very well of him. We have nothing else. That's all. After all we are more into criminals rather than honest people. The only noteworthy thing about his life is that it ended being hit by a car. -It must be someone working at the docks. -Ginetto. -Right, Ginetto. No, my brother stays out of this. He'd only need this job to buy himself the boat he wants. -I said no. -We're friends Vittorio, Iwouldn't want to forget about it. Do you know why Nick died? Because he had his own ideas, different from mine. Ginetto could always have an accident in the workplace. Right. I'm lucky to have you as a friend. -You talk him into it. -All right. -It won't be dangerous, don't worry. These Italians, they're impossible to figure out. -He|lo everybody. -We were just talking about you. -I also have something to tell you. -What? -I'm going back to Italy. This country is too different and I can't understand the people. -Do you renounce your boat? -Yes. -I have a good job for you Ginetto. -Thanks a lot but I'm leaving. He'd better accept or you'll be sorry. -You did so much to come here. -And now I'm going to leave. Why don't you come with me? -Brother, I'm wasting the best years of my life for a little money. The best thing in life is having money. You're not different from the rest. -Wouldn't it be nice to live like a millionaire? It's easy, you only need the cash. -And where is all this cash you're talking about? You're as poor as everyone down in our hometown. -At least we have the sea. -And hunger. And everyone working twenty hours a day to fish a couple of sardines. And you want to get married too. Ginetto, please don't leave. A smart girl. Vittorio is my brother. He's my brother, I must not do it. I want to leave... I can't stay here anymore... in his house... I must not do it... I must not... My brother was like a father to me. Calm down, sir Cliffton. Relax now. Why is Fred looking at me this way? Like he wants to beat me... What have I done to him? A knife! - Why? - Enough, Fred! He was leaving without even telling you. Did you know that? Fred is just trying to convince him to postpone his departure. What's your business with these people Vittorio? -Let's go back home, it's better. -I can't. - Unfortunately I'm against him leaving. It could be dangerous for him. Mariella. Mariella. Mr. Cliffton, listen to me. Do you remember why you are here? You're being cured, Mr Cliffton. -You had an operation. Do you remember that? -Yes. We want to help you. Do you understand this? The operation left you in a severe case of total amnesia. You don't have your real memories anymore. You are living in an imaginary past. A past that never happened. With facts and persons that your mind created. You're judge Reynold Cliffton. You don't know it yet, but you are judge Cliffton. Don't forget this. It's an order I'm giving you.. When you'll wake up all these fantasies will vanish because you are Reynold Cliffton. -You can wake up now. -Who's Reynold Cliffton? Think about it and it will come to your mind. - Who is he? - It's you. A dying man, already buried. What right do you have to take his brain and imprison it inside here! Why? You are not dead and you haven't been buried. Quite the opposite. We saved your life. -Saved whose life? -Judge Cliffton's He's the one who's living. Without transplant, no matter whether you are Cliffton or Ginetto Lamberti, you'd be dead anyway. -I'm alive instead. -Exactly, you're alive. Yes. Drinks are on me. I've just bought a new fishing boat. -I'm already drinking. -Can I have a dance with your girlfriend at least? -If she wants to... -I really like this music. Can I? C'mon, dance. I'm going to name my new boat Mariella. -Marie|la? Why? -Because I like it. It's the most beautiful name in the world. Is it a good name for a boat? -It would be a better name for a wife. -But you know, I like it more on the boat. At least you've got the boat. I'm tired. -Already tired? Yes, my feet hurt a bit. -That's too bad. I'm sorry. -We're sorry but we have to leave. So early? -Let's go. I'm gonna have my own boat one day. -You should name it ”wasted time” -I'll make up for it, you'll see. It won't be the same anymore. I'm afraid of letting you go. It feels like a bad omen. It's Susan my dear. Susan, your wife. Don't you understand? Don't worry, it's going to be all right. The operation was a success. Reynold Cliffton or Ginetto Lamberti. One or the other, you are who you are. Susan, my love. I'm Susan and you're Cliff. Do you really have to buy a boat, after all the money spent for the operation? Operation? Me? You are judge Cliffton. You don't remember yet but you're judge Cliffton. Why are you making that face, honey? Better being a judge than a fisherman. Operation? What did they do to me? Don't go to England. Don't leave me alone. A boat, what an idea Cliff! Look at me, I'm Susan, your wife. You are judge Reynold Cliffton. Reynold Cliffton No! I am Ginetto Lamberti! I am Ginetto Lamberti! Cliff! Oh Cliff! What's happening to you, my love? Calm down, please calm down. Do it for me. It's going to take some effort but think about our future! What future? Who are you? Those two scoundrels didn't want me to come back to my country. Did you know that? And Mariella... she'll be waiting for me. Cliff... my love... this is all going to end. Have you heard the doctor? And what about my brother? Cliff! Cliff... I'm begging you... I know it all looks almost incredible... absurd... But you're still ill... that's all. So, I am an ill person... Yes, but... you're going to get better. It will only take some time. - Of course. - And everything will be back to how it used to be. Yes. Everything will be back to how it used to be. I know my rights inspector. You can't force me out of my house. I've always helped you. What else do you want? Do you really want to ruin everything? Reynold Clifton thinks and acts with a transplanted brain, he's carrying images and memories we're trying to erase. He's thinking with your brother's mind, do you understand? - We want to avoid further shocks. - What do you mean? In this state he's capable of everything. - He must not find you here. - Sorry but I am not leaving. He may be disturbed but he's still alive after all. And that's none of my business anyway. If something is going to happen because of you... It will still be your fault. I assure you you're going to pay for it. You're not scaring me. Just leave now. I'd kick you out of here but you're too pathetic Sunset Street. Hurry, please. Yes. I've been here before. I... I work here. It's true. It's all true. This is dock number five. And what happened here? Here, on dock number five? Those two... my brother's friends... they... they had to send something to Instanbul. A package. I used to unload a cargo ship coming from Helsinki. What have I done? I'm happy now. But before, just minutes before, here on dock number five Six hundred grams of rough diamonds, so they said. Or maybe six hundred grams of pure heroin? That's more like it. I followed their instructions I hid the package where I was told to. 'ould have I done it anyway IfI knew it was heroin Or did I already know? I shouldn't have done that. Now I know. But that was me... me... walking with Mary... ...reassuring her, telling her that I had done what she said and the package was well hidden. Did I know that Mary was already thinking about... that Mary, that very night No, I can't remember... I can't remember about what happened that damned night. Isn't it strange? I only know we didn't go dancing Are you going for a walk? Fred told us to wait for him here so put down that bag and sit down! You don't want me to put a bullet in your brother's head, right? You coward. Enough. We have to wait for Freddy. Listen... you can do everything you want to me but let the boy go. He's different from us. You asked us to find him a job though. He wasn't different back then. Now he's got his job. You warned me. What are you doing with people like this? You asked me. It's such a dirty business. As soon as you can boy, go back home. How did he manage to leave the house? Sgt. Hornby was watching after him. I don't know, he looked so quiet... what can we do now? Don't worry, I knew this was going to happen eventually. What is he going to do? I don't know but maybe it will help him find himself. We couldn't keep him locked forever, like a sick child. - I'm so worried. - Do you know what time did he leave? - This morning, before eight. All right. I'll immediately contact inspector Todt. I'll keep you informed, don't worry. Hello Mary. I didn't imagine that... I didn't. It's all real! - You didn't love me, you were just pretending to keep me here. - No! Do you remember? You did it for them. I never realized that, and so did my brother but you were working for them! You sold us to them! I was fooled so easily. Of course. You are too beautiful. You didn't want me to leave. - And now you're going to pay! - No! No! Why should I spare your life, you poisonous snake? No, you can't do it! No? Why not? Where were you the night I was killed? No! Please, no! - Tell me! What happened that night? - NO! Vittorio! - Vittorio! - No! A brother doesn't lie. What happened that night? You must know. What do you want from me? I don't know you. You must be mad, go away. It's because of the operation What have they done to my thoughts? It's all so confused, so out of place. Who's this guy Reynold Cliffton? - You must know him. Tell me! - Yes, yes. Alright. But get your hands off me. I'll tell you who he is, but let me go. Please. Why are you acting like you don't know me? I'm your brother. I'm Ginetto. Don't you recognize me? - No. - No? How can it be? I'm your brother Vittorio. I'm Ginetto, look at me! I think I have gone on too long Now I'm a ready to answer your questions about this case. Professor, do you think the patient is going to survive? I've already explained all the details of the transplant but I can't predict the future. Only one thing I know for sure: it's been twenty-two months since the operation and the patient is still alive. And what about the moral implications? This transplant sets a new landmark in the history of modern medicine. But do you think it's morally acceptable to destroy a soul to heal a body? We fight any disease when its cause of pain or death. Death is obviously unavoidable Don't think. You must not think. Think about me, my love. London is so far away. What do you want from me? You're not my brother. You're not Ginetto. Cliff. Cliff... Don't do it, my love... ...especially at night when the sky is full of stars and sea is so calm... Why aren't you writing, my love? It's like I don't know you anymore. I want to take my corpse back to our hometown. What's wrong brother? Any problems with that? You... you must not be serious... Of course I am. That's the reason why I wanted to see you. To have a serious talk about my current situation. And see if you can help me out as a good brother should. I helped you when you had that gun pointed at your throat, didn't I? And I also helped those two scoundrels because they were friends of yours. So many times... you took advantage of me. But guess what? Now you're going to help me. - What do you want? - A passport. Are you kidding, where can I find one? You don't have to find it by yourself, just ask your friends. With all the things I know they're surely going to get me a fake passport. All right, I'll give it a try. But once you're in Italy, back in town... how are they going to react... you're not my brother... Vittorio! Still acting, even when we are alone! Somebody's paying you, isn't it so? He's forcing you! Somebody wants me to go insane! Vittorio, I am your brother, please tell me... Who wants me to go crazy? I'll find you the passport. But you must disappear, understood? Forget about my existence. Leave me alone for the rest of my life. Fred, I have to see you. -You'll have to shut his mouth forever. -I'm not a murderer! -I mean, I'm not a donkey but I can eat a carrot ifI need to... -Cut the crap! -How does he know about all those things? -And why does he sound just like my brother? Why did you give your consent for the transplant? Because you and Mary thought you could make some money out of it! -Enough! I've had enough of you all. I don't want to see you anymore Fred. Get out of my house! Out! All right, but you'd better be careful from now on. -Of course. I'm almost scared of being home alone. -Who knows about last night? -Only you. -You haven't even told professor Chalmers about it? -No. You'll have to, Susan. He might be able to prevent those suicidial impulses. You know it could happen again. I know. Cliff! -It's allright. He's just drunk. Call professor Chalmers. Cliff. Cliff! You'll never know who you are! Calm down, we're going to take care of you. -C|iff, no! -Let go of me! Let me go! -What are you trying to do? Keep him down, I'm going to sedate him. Cliff! You sure went on a bender. Next time you'd better call us before the first glass of whiskey. Money first. Take him out of here. Was it really necessary to meet here? I brought you the passport. -Let's have a walk. -A walk? Where? Inside? It's so cold down there at night. It's not like home we have orange trees growing in our graveyards. Take me home, don't leave me here freezing. When are we going to leave? No. No! NO!! -Good morning sir. -Good morning. -Good morning Inspector. -Is everyone else already here? -Yes. -Any news? -No, no yet. It's too early. -Please take a seat. I'm glad you're here. -I hope I'll be of some help. Would you like something to drink? No thanks. Or better, I'd have some whiskey. I'd like to remind you that a sick person doesn't escape on a whim, but for a precise reason. Sir Cliff is in the middle of an identity crisis. He's looking for himself in someone else's memories. Doctor Cobham and I think that sir Cliffton might be headed to Italy. In particular to a small town in the south. We already have a man waiting for him there. By the way. Vittorio left as well. Maybe he's got something to hide. Or something he's afraid of. I don't know. Maybe something sir Cliff might remember that could lead to a violent retaliation against Vittorio. - That's why he's hiding. I know Cliff very well. He's not a violent man. We'd better get used to the idea that none of us really knows sir Cliff anymore. The transplant was clinically successfull but what's the point in saving someone and then leave him in despair? Professor, when you say ”despair” are you perhaps talking about madness? A madman can also become a dangerous man... What are you trying to say.. - No, wait a second... I'm not implying this is all your fault but isn't it a bit unconsiderate letting an ill person like sir Cliffton traveling abroad? Maybe it is, but it's all part of a bigger plan aiming at the recovery of the patient. All right, we'll try to conciliate medicine and law. Thank you very much sir. Well, I have to go now. Don't worry Mrs. Cliffton we'll have soon some results. I was also about to leave. I'll show you the way out. -I'll be back tomorrow Mrs. Cliffton, but call me if anything happens. -Yes, I will. -Me too, and call me first. -Very kind of you, thanks. Would you like to have lunch with me? I'd love to. -I'm feeling so guilty. -Why? -I don't know. -I see no reason to feel guilty. Cliff is alone and it's only going to get worse. But it's not your fault. We're all a bit responsible for other people's pain. Cliff is slowing fading away from our hearts, day after day. That's only natural. We have nothing in common with him anymore. -With that stranger Chalmers assembled. -Flawless logic, I know. But maybe my hypocritical sense of guilt is nothing but an alibi. What we have never said to each other. What maybe we'll never confess to each other helps me to carry on, but also makes me feel like a thief. -You're not a thief if you're not stealing. -Aren't we? Only in our minds but, as you said, it helps to carry on. -Well maybe we should just avoid this topic. -But isn't it unfair? - Peter... - Cliff might be back home already, don't you think? Maybe we should be back as well, Susan. -Thank you Peter. -I don't think Cliff is going to make it to Italy. -How long have you been away? -Almost two years. The port must be very small if we can't even get there with the ferryboat I wonder how they're going to do with the fishing boats. -They leave them just outside the harbour. -You seem to know the place very well. -Oh yes, I was born here. -Rea|ly, I thought you were an Englishman. - No... Anyway it's great to still find places like this in these modern days. Pure air, no pollution, quiet, peaceful. I'm going to have a nice holiday. You're going to stay I suppose... Maybe. Well, it was a pleasure. I hope we're going to meet again. -Paolo! -Are you talking to me sir? Here I am. Anything you need? - Can't you recognize me? - I've never seen you before. Paolo! - May I come in? - Yes. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. -Doctor Hicker? I'm Marshal Giuliano Filoser. We were waiting for you. - Nice to meet you. - So you arrived together with our man, in the same boat. - Yes. The instructions are clear: the patient must never know that I am a doctor nor that you and your men are watching after him. - I've already been briefed about the task. I'm taking my hat off. Do you think we'll be able to follow his every move and examine him without being noticed? On our part we assure you he won't realise he's being followed constantly. I don't know how you're going to do, doctor, but I'm sure you already have a plan. Of course I have. Anyway we'll keep in touch. We're dealing with a man of exceptional intelli gence and culture. Don't underestimate him. -He|lo -We're coming up. We're almost there. Do you know who this man is? He's a friend of Ginetto, from London. Is he sending you? Please. Why isn't he writing me back? I keep sending letters. Why is he not answering? If he's sick he can ask someone else to write for him. -Why is he treating me this me this way? Maybe he has found another girl. - No Mariella. It's a whole different reason. One day you'll understand. Ginetto never stopped loving you. So he didn't want to leave me? -No, never. Good morning. Grandpa, this man is a friend of Ginetto, he's from London. -How's Ginetto? -He's doing fine. He used to be a good lad, and a good fisherman. -But he changed a lot, he's not behaving like a man of honor should. -Granpa... He made her a lot of promises but then, once he left he forgot about everything, even the ones who loved him. You don't know how wrong you are. -What are you talking about? -He wanted to come back here. But he died, seven months ago. -Dead... -No, no! Take away the body. I want to have a talk with professor Chalmers. Call Mrs. Cliffton as well. And doctor Cobham. -We don't know yet if sir Cliffton killed him. -I hope he didn't professor. -Sir Cliff has never been a murderer. -Nobody is until they kill for the first time. Would you please take a seat? -Sir Cliff is nothing but an ill person. -That's the problem. It's our fault for letting this ill person kill a man. According to the autopsy report Vittorio Lamberti was killed by a stroke. -Then why are you trying to blame Cliff? -The victim didn't have a heart condition. -Who else could have caused him a heart attack? -This can't be considered a murder anyway. -Let's see... -We have identified sir Cliff's footsteps in the crime scene, near Ginetto's grave. The girl who lived with Vittorio said he looked very anxious and nervous lately. Especially right after he met Cliff. And they met several times. This doesn't prove Cliff involvement in his death. He terrorized him, he was with him when he died, I call it a murder. That's quite a bold point of view inspector. You don't need to pull a trigger to be a murderer. There are many ways to commit a crime. Even if he's mentally ill and therefore not responsible for his actions I'll have to order his arrest and denounce him for murder. Sir Cliffton can't handle this, you're the one who's committing a murder. I beg you. Please, don't do it. -Do you still think that saving sir Cliffton's life was a good idea? -I don't know. Try to ask this question to a man with a brain tumor and a few days left to live. What's good and what's bad, inspector. I won't order sir Cliffton's arrest, at least for now. But if he ends up committing another crime, you'll be the one responsible. I agree inspector. As a man and as a scientist I take full responsibility. The inspector's hypotheses have no solid foundations. You have nothing to worry about. Peter. I'm scared. Could you stay here for the night? Well, i think, if you want... I don't want to be alone. ”Listening to Bach you can understand infinity.” -That's Cliff's. -How I wish I could get rid of him. -Tear him away from my heart! -But you can't. Can't you realise it Peter? We're living with a dead man! And we're slowly dying with him! -We can't abandon him. -Peter, we already did. His thoughts, his way of talking, his flaws... what's left of that Cliff now? -And what are we to him now? -We are all he's got. More like everything he doesn't want. That's why he left. And you, you're giving up everything for this man. This man we know nothing about. I go there, stay a couple of years, and when I'm back I'm going to marry you. You're always on my mind. I'm already dreaming about the day. Your white veil, the way you're going to look at me... ...the friendly faces and I... ...happy, happy like I've never been before Mariella. So happy I could forget about London, about all the bad things that happened during the last two years. And about that last night, that bitter, horrible night. It's all over now, all behind our backs. Just the two of us, in love, happy by ourselves. Mariella... the handshakes... and the crowd cheering us until we leave... I know everything Mariella... how the carriage is going to look... you waving goodbye like a princess... ...even the plume on the head of the horse... ...when is it going to be Mariella? When will I be able to tell you? I have to tell you. Just a moment of courage. I have to do it. You haven't eaten... Is there something you have to tell me? No, no! - Grandpa! - How did you know I was here? - There's a bad storm coming our way, we're not going fishing tonight. Mr Cliff has just left, all of a sudden... And where is he going? - Are you talking about that englishman? He was trying to sail away on the San Pietro not long ago. - Sail away? - Yes, and he succeeded, I saw him. The San Pietro? We had to tow it back to the port the other day, it's still damaged. Tell the marshal to prepare the rescue boat. And send a warning to the port captain's office. The storm should be two miles away from the coast now, he can't be that far yet. - Go home my dear. Let's see if we can save that fool. We've got no time to waste. If not for him let's do it for the boat. Oh, the Marshal. - Wait here, hold on for a second. -That guy must be really crazy. Can you hear me mr. Cliffton? There's a storm coming our way! Come back! Hurry up! The ship is going to sink! Hurry up! Good morning mr. Cliffton. Are you feeling better? The doctor here says you've got a strong body. That's right, he's completely fine. He's a got a bit of nervous tension though. I'm afraid the sea climate won't be of any help with that. -A girl was looking for you. Mariella. They didn't let her in but I told her you were feeling better. -When can I leave doctor? -Whenever you want. -Can I invite you out for lunch? I haven't met other tourists since I am here. And, in case you might want to go back to London I'd be glad to come with you. I think I'll stay here, I won't go back to London. - Good for you then, but my invitation still stands. See you later for lunch. It's a very delicate situation. I'm glad I'm not in your shoes. Yes, it's quite problematic. -What are you going to do? - 'll call London. They will decide. Honestly I don't know ifI should let him stay free or institutionalize him. -We|l, good bye doctor, and thanks. -Good bye. Let's not forget that a man died because of him. Now that doctor tells us about this new ”adventure” Are we still letting him roam free or is it time to put him in a madhouse? This is a man without a past. And without a future. What are we going to do with him? Please tell me, you're the one responsible after all. Why? This is the way of scientific progress . If these are the results it's better if science slows down a little bit. Criminal behaviour and depravity are not a consequence of scientific progress. Cain killed Abel. Do you think that without cars, planes or antibiotics all the thieves would suddendly turn into honest men? Enough with this nonsense! It's not fear and stupidity who make us live longer and better but science and technology! I know you'd feel better if we just locked him up but he's the first of his kind and I want to see him interact with a normal environment. Moderation is the key to equilibrium. And equilibrium is the law of the universe. I think this time you've gone too far. This transplant is an abomination. Living with the brain and the thoughts of a dead man. Is he ever going to adapt? I don't know. -Do you think he could become a danger? -I don't know either. Excuse me sir. Reynold Cliffton must come back. I'm sorry. I understand inspector. Inspector, you're not the only recipient of this letter once you will receive it... Good evening Lady Cliffton. Good evening professor Chalmers. -May I come in? -Yes, of course. We were just about to leave. I knew it was going to be inappropriate to show up at such a late hour but it's about sir Cliff. -Any news? -I'm going to Italy -What happened? Nothing, really. Ijust want to keep a close eye on him and in the meantime have a holiday. But I thought the inspector wanted Cliff back to London. I won't let them do it. It would be a tragedy for sir Cliffton. -But wouldn't it better for him to find a good clinic... - 0, Mrs. Cliffton. I came here to say good bye. And to apologize. I'm really sorry, believe me. -You don't have to. And above all I'll have to apologize to your husband. But it's not your fault professor. You saved his life. If it happens again I'm going to kick you all to Sardinia. No excuses, you have to follow him everywhere. and without being noticed. Enough with your lame excuses! Excuse me sir, i'm sorry sir... No, I just wanted to report about last night. It was all your fault. What about the boat, any damages? No sir. -All right, leave us alone now. -Please doctor, take a seat. I was complimenting my men about last night. They followed him, they saw him take the boat but of course they couldn't stop him without being noticed. I've talked with London. They say our problems will be over in three days. I'm sorry but I don't understand. Here in Italy when we have a madman we just lock him up, unless he is a politician. We know he is not a minister, what are you waiting for then? He's a case of experimental madness. Oh great, now we have artificial wackos too. But what if he causes any trouble? I'm the one responsible here in this town. - Good tobacco. - I know. Italian. Mariella. Are you feeling ill? There something we have to talk about, alone. -My granpa is going to be back soon. -We can go to the beach. -The beach? -The one behind the dunes. -Have you forgotten about it? -Mr Cliffton how do you know about that place? Mr. Cliffton... The good old friend, Mr. Cliffton... -Ginetto used to talk a lot about you. -Ginetto was my only love. Mariella... There's a big secret I have to confess. -A secret? -Yes. -About Ginetto? -You must know everything Mariella. -You're very pale. Are you sure you're all right? They're going to take me back to England. Mr. Cliffton, I hope you won't leave. You were Ginetto's friend. -Can I see you tomorrow? -Yes. -Goodbye, Mariella. -See you tomorrow. We used to come here all the time. How did you know that? This is the spot where we said goodbye to each other. Mariella... Mariella, my love... Why can't you recognize me? It's me, Ginetto! Your beloved Ginetto! Please, listen Mariella. You have to know everything... -Wait Mariella, please! where are you going? Please don't run away Mariella! -Marie|la, look at me! It's me, Ginetto! -Let go of me! -Let me go! -Why... Mariella, I love you! -I love you Mariella. -No... Listen... Mariella... Mariella... Don't cry, it's over now. Go to bed. Tomorrow morning you're going to feel better. -It's useless, you won't find Mr. lefton. We've already put him under arrest. He didn't mean to harm your granddaughter. He's going to be institutionalized. It's not his fault. Two years ago, I used to think that saving a life was always a good thing, no matter the price. Now I know how inhuman it is to condemn someone to a life of despair but it's too late. Cliffton... Could you please leave us alone for a moment? Ginetto. You are tired. Aren't you? Yes. Tired of everything... ...of your thoughts, your memories... of these fragments of life that don't fit together anymore. What do you want me to do? It's all my fault. I'm sorry, but what else can I do now? Subtitles Created by richdager
