Only cats don't look away when they cause others pain. These carrots are super gross. Do you always have to be so loud? No noise, that's the basics. Move it. Talk about a corny hunting blind. You'd have to pay me to make me hunt here. I can get behind a camera for large game, but this? You wanna see if there are groundhogs? Put out some traps? No, it's a camera to monitor my camera. I think someone's been coming and erasing my photos. Que pasa, bro? Someone took my memory card. -Who? -I dunno, that's the problem. Your truck has no seatbelts? I cut them off. Okay, but the beeping is pissing me off. It'll stop in a bit. Step on it! Go, go, go! What the fuck, bro? Hit the switch next to the fuel door release. What is it? What are you doing? Jesus Christ, kid. No noise, Adam. The basics. What the fuck, man. It's a 400-pound bear. What do we do with that? We chop him up! Turn it off! Stop! No, let's get out of here. No, I'm not leaving without its paws. Okay, but do it fast. Let's go! Come on, what's the point of that? I heard the dogs but no cars or anything, so I called right away. Dammit. Did you notice, they only come by when you have game here? Give this to the dogs. They got into the office, not the garage. Not for lack of trying. -Did the cameras pick 'em up? -I'll chop up the deer. I'll get 'em down, uncle. I didn't see the footage. We're not taking chances, let's wipe it clean. Call your brother in to help. Tell him to get here quick. Ten o'clock, you're up late. Ten my time or ten your time? -Ten on this side of the border. -Not so bad. Hey, give me a break. Tony, would you make your bed and pick up a bit before you leave? Why? I always close the door. Just pull up the covers. Brooklyn likes it when things are neat. But Chuck's sleeping bag on the couch for three months is fine? -Chuck pays rent. -The rent! One eighty-five Canadian. Not even $200? Is that for my bear paws? It's $400 a paw. Where are you? Get your ass to the garage -One ploye? Two ployes? -Huh? Ploye? Just a moment. Phone's for you, Mrs. Irène. It's Adam. Okay, just a moment. -Here. -Thanks. -No, it's on the house. -No, come on. You give us so much good publicity. Yeah, but you pay for it! And you bring your own cup. You're a real city girl! Not a city girl. Not really. Best in town. Go see Adam. Tell him I sent you, he'll give you a deal. -Have a good day. -Thanks! Hi Adam. Again? Hey, Bloue! Why's this at 50 degrees? Should be 40 when there's game. Okay. Can't see a damn thing, again. Shit. So much for replacing them. -They stole the till. -How much? 300 inside, but they found the 2000 hidden underneath. Shit, $2000! -Mono, just sell it to restaurants. -Okay. We can't sell it to the public, it's too risky. And skip Québec City and Trois-Rivières. Steer clear of small towns. Should be fine. Same for Germain, forget the Gaspésie and the public, sell it to restaurants in New Brunswick. Make it happen. And explain to Germain. I already told the New Be. Germain's at the restaurant with gran getting the meat. Okay, let's move. The game wardens? Doubt it. They stole $2300 from the till. But the game wardens are like the police. They're full of crooks. When they stage a raid, they party with champagne in fancy hotels in Rivière-du-Loup. $2000, they'd take it for sure. Even if it's not the wardens, if someone else comes in here and sees this, people will talk and it'll put us in deep shit. We should take a real break. We're always on high alert here. Let's say no more poaching for a month. Until hunting season. August, September, early October. That's not a month. That's more than two months. It'll make us appreciate the hunt more. You want to work 60 hours a week here? Elbow deep in motor oil for $15 an hour all year? Better than losing the garage. And we can use the time to bring it up to date. How many electric cars do we turn away per month? Three months? No, no. Those were my last two deer before hunting season. Anyway, bush game killed in summer isn't great. The tenderloin's good. And the rest is fine when it's ground up. And with this heat, too. There was this crafty old game warden. Basley was his name. He really wanted to nab us, your dad and me. It's true that we were terrible. Some years, come fall, there wasn't a deer left at the start of the hunt. So at one point, this smartass, he stuck a pair of antlers on his head and decided to answer our calls. We could see him coming, though. He didn't look like a moose at all. Your dad wanted to give him a scare. He tried to shoot past his ears. Ended up shooting him right in the head. We were just kids, 15 and 16 years old. He was acquitted. "Hunting accident." I backed your dad up. I didn't say a word. He's always been like a brother to me. I know this story, Armard, I've heard it 100 times. But in my dad's version, he was in his blind. He never heard Mr. Basley. Your dad should have told you the truth. Maybe you wouldn't have become a game warden. Breaking into the garage at night, that was you? I have no idea... Like your weekly visits aren't bad enough for business? We come when shots are fired. There were shots in the zone again yesterday at dusk. Maybe it was the Gagnons or the Castonguays! The Gagnons, the Castonguays and everyone else, they take one deer or moose a year, sometimes two. Only the Arsenaults are still in that racket. Adam is slowly taking over the garage. Anthony has cooled down. They're good guys, those kids. Armard, I can't close my eyes to everything all the time. You understand? You're making me look bad. When Joe got sick, I was there for your brothers. And for your mom. And for you too. It'd be too bad if you forgot that. Hello! Can I help you? Adam, we're booked up for the day. Irène told me to come here. I just need an oil change, I'm 2000 kilometres overdue. And I need a new passenger-side wiper. Okay, we can take care of it. You can get it at the end of the day? I can bring it in. No, it's okay. I'll do it. Leave me your keys. Around what time? Around five? We close at four. You mean around four, you close at five? Yeah, that makes more sense, eh? You got the number for a taxi? Yeah. Hey Bloue, what's the number for the taxi? A taxi for this lovely lady? Dang! No taxi required, drive her yourself. No, it's okay. Yeah, but you have errands to run in town. -I don't want to be a bother. -I'm Bloue, this is Adam. -I'm Émilie. -Give me those. Go on, Adam, drive her into town. -Yeah. -Are you sure? -Yeah, sure. Get in. -Thanks. Net pay from out west. -How much? -$35,000. Not quite half, I know. 35 is good. But if it takes another two years, we might die before we see the colour of our money. I really want to pay you and grandpa back. I swear. Then go work at the garage. For fifteen bucks an hour and oily hands? No thanks. If the money's coming in and we're not getting woken up by the police, if I don't have to post bail or hire lawyers, it's fine if it takes a little longer. Yeah, but that's over. That's what the garage is for. I don't even know how to do an oil change. You'd learn. A tennis player? No, no! -That's five-star service! -I filled your tires, too. They were low almost 15 pounds each. That's real nice of you. How much do I owe you? Let's say 60 bucks? That's worth more than $60. So you'll come back. Aren't you the only spot in town? Nope. Town's full of garages. And hairdressers. See you around. Yeah. -Hi grandma. -Hi. Have you eaten? I was just warming up leftovers or they'd go bad. What are you eating? -Chicken. -With potatoes? No, just chicken. Come on over, I have too much. Okay, on my way. You're being followed? Are you sure? That's not very subtle. No, it's clearly no coincidence. You did good. No, don't fucking bring the truck here! Okay, I'll call you later. Oh, Adam, did the girl from the radio station come by with her car? Yeah. Mono thinks he's being tailed by the cops. He has all the meat in his truck and he can't leave it anywhere. Isn't it a little dangerous talking about that on the phone? We're using an encrypted app. In theory, it's safe. In theory. Heck, we could be bugged right here, or at the garage. We can't be too paranoid about everything. I'm just saying that it's safer to speak face to face in the woods, like back in the day. Like back in the day. Is Anthony late again? -Or isn't he coming? -No, he's with Fraser. Must be in New Brunswick, he's staying there. Come celebrate Emily's first month at the radio station tomorrow night. He brought me a thick stack of cash today. Alberta was a good idea, in the end. How much? That's between him and us. Hey, Dad. Come see the videos. -Weren't your cards stolen? -Yeah, in the hunting zone. The camera on the lot sends them via satellite. By wifi? Something like that. It's crazy what they can do these days! Is that my buck? Holy shit, he came back! So beautiful! I hear your brother killed a bear this week? -No, my brother didn't kill a bear. -People are saying he did. Well, I'm telling you he didn't. And I'm sick of your stories. Well, you know what they say: Once an Arsenault, always an Arsenault. -Four shooters, please. -What kind? I dunno, something strong. What's strong, Adam Arsenault? Hi! A 911. Four 911s, please. Six! Who are they for? The crew from Radio des Frontières. We're celebrating my first month here. Yeah? -Come sit with us? -No, I don't want to intrude. Six 911s for the fire chief and the pretty new girl. Volunteer fire chief. Welcome to town! That's good. Oh shit, it's strong! Excuse me. I'll be right back. Fuck, Anthony, when I say we don't want to see you at the bar, that includes the parking lot. What the fuck! This is Chuck, an American running from the cops. He was in the Gulf War. Quit fucking around and piss off before the cops show up again. Here's the bouncer. You like playing policeman, eh? You'd have liked to be a big tough policeman, eh? That's enough. -A pretty female! -Shut up, kid. Pretty female? The police are coming. Cops are coming, let's get outta here. Piss off! Can't have fun here, can't meet any pretty girls, that's why this town is so dead. Hey Fraser, bring down the cooler. Hey everyone! Free booze! You can't say that Anthony Arsenault isn't a good guy. Arsenault? Your brother? Yeah, his brother. He's the fortunate son, as they say. -Can I get you a drink, sweet lady? -That's enough. Good night, all! Enjoy yourselves! Fuck off! What do you want? That's enough, now. Can I help you? I wanted to apologize for before. It's a bit stressful, doing it in the middle of the night. -Sorry. -No big deal. Your high beams on? No, it's just that this truck rides high. Sorry. That's a lot of apologizing in just a short while. What's all that? Moving boxes sent on the bus. I haven't had time to unpack them. Sent by your boyfriend? My boyfriend? What makes you think... Oh no? So maybe you need some help with the boxes? Need these arms? No thanks, I'm okay. Come on, girl. It'll take 15 minutes! Girl's going to bed. Come on, Steve, give it some choke! It's Émilie what? Émond. -Emily Emon. -Émand. -Not Émand, Émond. -That's what I'm saying. -C'mon, you're good at that. -No one's "good at this". -Is it my fault I'm not on Facebook? -Me neither, never will. Here's one. Radio des Frontières. It's her. Think that's her boyfriend? He looks like a rat. It sure ain't her brother! The one and only Anthony Arsenault. Getting out and about? Taking it easy? Kids these days call it "chilling". The beauty of it is you can't arrest us. It's legal now. We can't arrest you 'cause we're not the police. True. You guys are the paw patrol. Not long in Alberta? There was a shutdown. Do shutdowns still happen? You wouldn't know who's trying to sell bear paws around here? Who to answer first? For the bear paws, try the Chinese diner in Edmundston. -And yes, there are still shutdowns. -Don't be a smartass. If you remember, you know how to find us. Seems you know how to find us too. Sure. Nice to see you back, we were starting to miss you. Fuck, I knew it. There's a tracker. You're leaving it on? -Yeah, I'm leaving it on. -How long has it been there? And Mono was arrested. Okay, we'll cancel deliveries and get rid of our stock. For both runs, Mono's and Germain's. I'll make a list of restaurants that we're not linked to. You go in, go to the bathroom and leave. Then you go to the next one. Just stay long enough for the pigs to take down the address. You ever been to Nova Scotia? They wanna play? We'll play. No matter the cost, those fuckers. You got another problem, too. We're stuck with the meat in here. What are you doing? Tear it all out. That's not cool. If you leave a little piece, when they get here in the morning, they can keep going. They'll tear up the floor. At Ti-Coeur's. Why does he want to know? And I wanna know how the wardens knew we were at Steve's ranch. Okay boys, the copper's not gonna strip itself. The lunch specials are pizzaghetti and shepherd's pie with pouding chomeur for dessert. Comes with a soup and a drink. It's $13.95. I told you he'd give you a deal. Yeah, he's a sweetheart. Okay, bye. That Émilie's such a nice girl. The black bag is the bank deposit, the blue one is the credit union. No problem, Mrs. Irène. I'll call you back in a bit, okay? I'll be ready in 30 seconds. A special request? A personal call. Long distance. Your boyfriend? Curious? No, just teasing. Hey, I'm sorry about the other night. Anthony's a moron. No, cut it out. It's not your fault. You don't choose your family. -Is this it? -Yeah. -Thanks for helping with this. -No worries. -I'll be right there, two minutes. -Okay. What do you mean by "preparing the hunt"? Feeding the deer, placing salt licks. Setting up our blinds. We have cameras to study the habits of the game, so we do that. You must be excited for fall. Of course. But I like everything about hunting. Setting up, following trails, being in the woods. Hunting alone, hunting in a group. I dunno, I like it all. For me, hunting is year-round. Year-round? But you can't... No, I mean, I think about it and prepare for it all year, not... Perfect. It's gazpacho! Eat it while it's cold! Cucumber and mint? You have a good nose. White pepper, too? -I told you you put too much! -Oh shut up, silly. It's really good! You're late, kid. So this is your girlfriend, bro? -Shut up. -What? Irène said you'd bring your girlfriend. I never said that, Anthony Arsenault! Irène invited her! -Settling into town? -Yeah. That's good to see. Did you bring in your boxes? Yeah, I'm resourceful like that. -What boxes? -What are we eating? Charcoal-grilled moose steaks. It's her first time. First time? You've never eaten moose before? -Where are you from? -Anthony! Chibougamau. -Don't start. -What? I'd like to know more about my sister-in-law. Where did you do radio before? Maniwaki, Sept-Îles, Les Escoumins, Havre-Saint-Pierre. Sudbury, Ontario, too. -A northern girl! -Yeah. Diane Doiron. Who is that? My mother. Why? Where did you learn that name? Just curious. Your mother? Cool. Do you have to always ruin our dinners? Can't we just take it easy and... No, hold on. I want to know. Where did you learn that name? The other night, when I offered to carry your boxes in. One had that name on it. You got good eyes. Thought it was your girlfriend and you were a dyke. Would you sit down and chill out? Why's that? Because I don't succumb to your charms? No, no. You're not free, in any case. You ever eaten caribou? No, he's never eaten caribou. Oh yeah? You think you're better than us 'cause you've eaten caribou? What are you doing? Anthony, leave the lady alone. I've had partridge. It was disgusting. I've never gone hunting, but I'm a great fisher. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Fishing is pretty fun too. I have an idea. You two should go fishing together. -Wouldn't that be cute? -Are you done? Wouldn't they, Grandma? In your boat on the lake? It would tip like this, though. I'm talking to you. Are you done? Take your bread and your two beers and go drink with your buddies in New Brunswick. Come back when you're able to behave yourself! Excuse him. He's not used to not being the centre of attention. Excellent timing. Sorry for the moose call... or bear or wolf or deer. Okay, I'm gone. -Hi Irène. -Hello. Good. You know, you got three excellent hunters right here? -Yeah, that's what I hear. -Oh yeah? Who says that? I don't need to explain your reputation to you, do I? For the big one, I can get $20,000. The little one will easily fetch $2000. You don't know me very well, Rambo. -I feel like I've been here before. -It's possible. Go bring this to the truck. I'm gonna unscrew this one here. Hit the fucking gas! One-two, one-two. We're a minute from the starting gun. Let me remind you that the annual canoe race is brought to you by Radio des Frontières and the fire services of the municipality of Témiscouata. Let me present the race referee, your very own fire chief, Adam! Are you ready? Yeah! On your marks, get set... It's an energetic start! The Arsenaults are still in the lead, but a canoe behind them is steadily gaining. Will the Lebel brothers succeed in ousting the reigning champions of the three last races? Nine of the last ten, that is! Hey Dad, lead the canoes to the other side. We can't let people see this. Everyone to the left! I'm still shaking. Yeah, you never get used to that. Do you see them often, as a firefighter? Do you often talk to the police? What do you mean? You must talk to them. You announce crimes and accidents and stuff. I'm not a journalist, but yeah, they call in the morning to brief me on the previous night's incidents. When there are any. But it's usually road accidents, not deaths. -Yeah. -Why? I'd like to know the caliber of the bullet. Isn't that confidential? Why? It's just that we often know more than the police. I might be useful. Is that the fire chief talking? Or Adam Arsenault? Both. I know that all this is intense. The body and everything. But don't let it mix us up. I'm not mixed up at all. I'd have kissed you the first time you came to the garage. Okay, sorry. I shouldn't have. No, it's okay. Promise! Again? What? Oh come on, you want to sleep in it? I think we can get rid of it. Yeah, sure. We can get rid of it. You look like that didn't bother you one fucking bit. It's not that I'm not upset. I'm fucking stressed, man. I didn't know that guy. But it could just as well have been you. If Chuck had gone to get the truck. All right, we'll have to show our faces at the funeral. I can't cross the border, I have a record. You mean you can't go? Or you can't come back? I have two records, so both ways. Canada and the US. Agent Diane Doiron from the Wildlife Protection Service. She's infiltrated the Arsenaults. Tell her what you told me. The day before the body was found, the American and Jason Fraser came to pick up Anthony from his grandfather's house. That's not at all what they told us. Thanks, that will be helpful. We have to be careful, this intel can't leave the room. And Adam. Yeah, Adam wants to know the caliber of the bullet. Why does he want to know? He wants to be useful. So he says. I'm starting to piece together their poaching ring, but with the murder, I had to come forward. We're looking for a .357 Magnum, you can tell him that. If you find one, let us know. It's not a common caliber around here. Mostly used in revolvers. I'm in deep. You'll have to up your surveillance. Should we call in your colleague now, instead of waiting for fall? I haven't played the card of the girl waiting for her man. I haven't dropped any hints about my supposed spouse. I'm not following that script. It's because they see me as single that things are falling into place. You can trust me. I can't approve that line of action, Diane. We're risking a lot. So are you. We have a plan. And we'll carry it out in fall, as planned. I'm right on the edge. We'll talk about it before hunting season opens. Okay, but Jesus Christ, be careful. The other night, Anthony came into your place as you showered. I had a security guard ten seconds away from going in when he came out. Oh yeah? Come on, step on it! There. -Think you're funny? -My condolences for your friend. Thanks, but I didn't really know him. -Pretty intense anyway. -That's for damn sure. You followed me to say that? No, I saw your truck and I wanted to ask what your problem is with me. I got no problem. -The other night, at Irène's? -Just teasing you and the big guy. Have I done something wrong? I wasn't that bad. Not bad, but something's wrong. I don't like how you look at us. That's all. Nothing serious. How do I look at you? And what do you mean, "us"? I dunno, you look at us like a city girl. First time I've heard that one. What are you doing with my brother? No girl is ever interested in Adam. Oh, that's it. It bothers you. No, I'm just worried about him. Look, let's go to the bar, you buy me a drink like you said, and we'll start over. I'm barred from the bar. All the bars? Follow me. Depends on your perspective. Oh yeah? Please elaborate. Before, the forest belonged to everyone. We hunted to eat, like the Indians. My grandpa and his brothers hunted deer in winter when the snow crusted over. Killed them with a knife. -No. -I swear! Then the government decided hunting should be in a hunt zone, with a license, this kind of gun, this day, only in fall. Blah blah blah. That's interesting, but perspective is not the issue. It's illegal. Not if you're not caught. Here, give it. You can go to jail for that. Mostly it's just fines or seizure of firearms. At worst, they'll take your truck if you don't pay your tickets. You seem to know what you're talking about. Aw jeez. We said not this summer! We said for a while. It hasn't been a while, just a few days! We said not before the season starts. I'm bagging him tonight. -We're being watched! -Shut up and push. Hey Dad? I think he's getting close. He's so big, I can't miss him. You never told me what you did to your arm. My dad and the big guy just killed a moose. I have to help them get it out before sunrise. They must be in a bind, to call me like this. I hope you know you're not going without me. Okay, it's locked. Where's the monster? What's she doing here? She said she wanted to learn about hunting. She was interested. Didn't want to wait till fall, did we? We ran into each other at the bar. I just wanted a little scotch before bed. Didn't know where I was going. -Who shot it? -I killed it. He went to the lake to die. He's a tough one. Put it in reverse. You gotta move. Yeah. Okay Dad, floor it! From noon to two, I record it beforehand. Sorry about yesterday. It was weird. No, I'm the one who's sorry. You shouldn't have seen that. Anthony was an idiot to bring you along. Is it still here? The moose? It was dangerous. With Anthony that drunk. Wasn't my best idea. But nothing happened. That's what matters. I found what you asked for. The bullet was a .357 Magnum. But you didn't hear it from me. .357? Does that help? I'll have to think about it. It's not so common around here. What is it, a revolver? No, not necessarily. Do you guys have any .357s? No .357s, but pretty much everything else, we have. Okay! Hunting year-round. It's more complicated than that. -Are you fucking insane? -The harm's already done. What do you want? Why are you here? And yesterday too? Why are you always here? -I'm just following... -Calm down, Dad. Couldn't you have found a girl when you were 20, like everyone else? Acting like teenagers at 35, for chrissake. I'm always cleaning up after you! Not a word. There were gunshots in the zone last night. We're asking our regulars. Oh, we're still in the regulars? You're the only ones left in the business. You've got cameras all over, you know the game, maybe you can help us out. You might have an idea? We don't know anything. Where were you last night? At my grandma's place. I was with them. We ate supper together, then had a drink with Anthony. Sorry, Miss, but what is your relationship here? Friend of the family. You should stay away from them, my dear, unless you want problems. I'm not your dear, but thanks for the advice. Is that all, gentlemen? Can we look into your endlessly renovated garage? The garage is occupied. One phone call and we'll be back with a warrant. Come when you want. The business hours are posted on the door. Good day, then. Is it always like that? Don't get yourself in shit for our sakes. We're not worth it. I think it'd be better if I come in. There was something sketchy about the motor, so I checked the serial number and it says "Arsenault and son." I don't buy stolen gear. I don't need any shit from the cops. Yeah, that's ours. Actually, it's my dad's. I took a screenshot from the security cam of the guy who sold it to me. -I dunno if you know him. -Well, fuck. That shithead. -That little shit! -Wait a sec. Go on. He said it was his and I trusted him but then I had a weird feeling. Yeah, we know him. How much do we owe you? And we'll take care of the rest. Fifteen hundred and the deal is done. What are you doing, Dad? Here's the keys to my house, to Grandma's and to the cabin. -Where's the keys to the garage? -Why, what's up? I've tried hard to give you chances and to believe in you, but you screwed me over again! You have until evening to bring me the garage keys. After that, I don't wanna see your face. Tell me what happened! You've started stealing from your own grandpa! Your grandpa! Now I get why your mom left you here when she fucked off. Step on the gas! What are you doing? What? I don't have the keys anymore. What time is the fire? We'll start it when it's dark, around 10. Your dad and Armard were saying that the wood is so dry, you'll need twice as much as usual. I'm sure they'll figure something out. They cut some pines and they'll put them in the middle. I think it'll flame up, and then... Adam? You okay? A little old man from our town through Kent County did roll When suddenly he saw the St-Antoine highway patrol He hauled over to the side, his blinkers flashing red He rolled down his window and this is what he said I filled my tires with air I adjusted my mirrors I paid up my insurance so I'd be insured I didn't break the speed limits Fraser. Fraser! Hey, gang! It's Émilie from the radio station and Florence from the restaurant. Florence got lost on the way. She was on foot. Okay, now that everyone's here... Mushrooms! And I have a present for whoever falls asleep last... A grenade! It's from Afghanistan, I hear. You have to do mushrooms with me. No, I have to work tomorrow. No big deal. I want to win the grenade. I have to stay lucid. Where is it? You haven't won it yet. It has to be earned. Is it safe to have a grenade here? Just have a little. The king's son went out hunting With his great silver gun You asleep? I feel good. Fucking good, man. So high up. We're so fucking small. And we shoot at each other. But none of it really matters. We're just here. I'm pretty high! I think I'm higher than I think I am. I can't tell. Holy shit, what a trip! I don't even know what I'm drinking. Bring out the BBQ! Holy shit! Come on! CLOSED FOR THE DAY Hey, can we talk? The animals that I know are scared they will be hurt Things have been moving quickly these past weeks. We thought it would take a year, but an undercover agent witnessed the Arsenaults committing several crimes. She was able to piece together how the ring functions. She witnessed acts of poaching and showed us where to find meat that was killed by poaching, unregistered firearms, illegal goods and stolen goods. We also have the names of delivery drivers, clients and restaurants. It's a long list. André-Yves Arsenault and Adam Arsenault. We'll pick them both up around 8AM at the Arsenault garage. Poaching, illegal sales and networking, possession of firearms. Anthony Arsenault. He's a serious problem, but he's not our problem. His file was given to the police in New Brunswick, because he lives with a friend, Jason Fraser, in Edmundston. It's a job for the police, because we mainly have criminal charges against him. Acts of cruelty to animals, possession of firearms including a grenade, robbery, theft of money, sale of stolen goods, assault. Why'd you have to mix Émilie up in your bullshit? Why can't you leave her alone? I'm talking to you! What? You want me to leave you alone? You fuckhead! So much paperwork! Here it is. The grandmother, Irène Arsenault, is an accomplice. Illegal sales and networking. At the restaurant, around 8AM. We're looking for a paper trail. Chequebooks, cash, the head office. We may find meat there too. We know clients ready to testify about their secret menus. I'd give anything to be there. No. From now on, we don't exist. ...tomorrow morning, from Percé to Montreal, with support from officers from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. We treat this as a standard bust. We interrogate them, we inform them of the charges and the court dates. The police will take over if we find drugs or stolen goods. Let us do our job, don't be cowboys! All right. The American found dead in the Madawaska River was a friend of Anthony and Fraser. They were seen together the evening before he died. For us, the most important thing is the seizure of firearms. You can't miss even one. We're looking for a .357 Magnum. It may be a revolver or a short rifle with a 12-inch barrel. We'll make our arrests when you're done your work. The Arsenaults can't know that we're looking for a murder suspect. I'm still in contact with the inside agent if you need more information. A little more. Straighten out. Good. Further, further. They can eat my shit. They'll never see me again. I'll sell the horses and live on that for six months. Six months? Not likely. Two months max, I'd say. Just a sec. Hello. You okay? You don't seem okay. I have a migraine that won't go away. Can we talk tomorrow? If I don't talk to you, I won't sleep tonight. I'm starting to get a headache too, just thinking about it. What's this about, Adam? Are you alone? Yes, I'm alone. What? I don't know. You haven't answered my texts for a couple days now. You've been with my brother two nights in a row. I thought that... I dunno, that... Well, that's it. That's what it's about. -Why don't you open the door? -Adam, that's all nothing. My brother's not who you think he is. Florence invited me. -If you knew... -I don't give a shit about him. For real. Adam? Adam. What? Sit down. Aw, fuck. Don't just stand there, help me, you shit! You disrespecting me? That pisses me off. Why the fuck were you pushing him from behind, you shithead? Everyone knows you can't push a horse's ass. Where are you going? I'm not going there, I'm going the other way! I'm not bringing you to New Brunswick. Let me out here. Stop right here, I said! What's up, man? That's for Chuck, you fucker. You asleep? What are you doing? Your migraine any better? Yeah, it's better. A road accident. Gotta go. -Where? -The old road. This is fire chief Adam Arsenault. I've just gotten to the accident site. 10-34, Jaws of Life. Théo? Théo, it's Adam. The ambulance is coming. Stay with me, Théo, okay? It's okay, man. I'll stay with you, we're together here. That's right. Breathe, man. Ross! Come here! Is that Anthony? -Yeah. -With Steve's trailer. Last night's accident. Your bust can no longer go forward. Jesus! We've been preparing for six months! We have a death to deal with. That trumps poaching. It's now a police operation. I'm requesting a warrant. At least wait for the others so we can pick them up after. He can't get far, he's stuck there. -Diane? -Hello. I need some ideas. Anthony is hiding out in the garage. The police think he was involved in a fatal crash last night. What do you mean? He has Steve's trailer with him. I'm on my way. No, don't! You'll burn your cover. I'd hang the fucker out to dry. Yeah? The cops are here looking for you. They have two game wardens with them. How'd you know he's not there? We said 8 o'clock. It's 7:15. It was supposed to be 8 our time, not 8 your time! Agent Doiron. Where's Ross? You can't go over there. This is my investigation. Where's Ross? -You're burning your cover! -I know. You have to let me talk to him, it'll make a difference. Come here, we'll talk. Hey bro, listen up. Call Dad. Don't come in, the game wardens are coming. Tell uncle and grandma. I'll take care of the garage, I'm here now. Did he just lock the gate? Figure he knows we're here? Get into your cars. Everyone stand by. Fuck. And on the other side? Cops and game wardens. About 15 of them. Cops? What do you mean cops? I think you guys have a problem. -Let me explain. -I think it's clear. It's worse than you think. The accident last night. Your brother stole some horses and one probably escaped. The Arsenault takedown is no longer the priority. Your brother has to give himself up without any trouble. Hold on a sec. But you... All of that... Yes, Adam. Yes. I tried to be as proper as I could. I know that doesn't make it better. I find it hard, okay? Why'd you find it hard? We're crooks, for fuck's sake. This is what we deserve. No, you're not all crooks. You have to help us. You're the only one who can talk to him. Easy, horse. Anthony! Diane, what's going on? We're at the garage, Adam's trying to get Anthony to come out. Jesus, the guy is armed! Get out of there! We're coming with backup. I don't want a standoff. Diane, you have to respect the protocol! Oh yeah? I just found out, too. -He has nothing to do... -Shut up! A guy died last night. Ran into a horse. One of Steve's horses. Théo Morin. Only 19 years old. The kid died in my arms, Anthony. An accident. Okay. An accident. Théo son of Dré Morin? Of Dré Morin. And Nancy Morin. Yup. No one here wants to have to shoot you in the head. That's why I'm here. Give yourself up and take responsibility for your shit. That's the least you can do for us. Okay. Give me two minutes. What are you doing? Going to see if the dogs are tied up. Okay Ross, no more of this. The two guys are in the garage. I'm calling the tactical squad. What's going on? Hey, what's Anthony doing? No idea. Figure it out. Don't lose sight of him, but keep your distance. Be careful. I don't know what's going on. What's going on? Where's he going? What do we do? He cleaned it right out, the fucker. Squeaky clean. Fuck.
