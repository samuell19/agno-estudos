Our battle positions are uncovered! - Adieul Mon petite jiou-jioul - Bravo! Captain S z?chenyi! A trot is in order for conduct unbecoming of an officer! I accept! And I admit, I am at fault! Come on! Stefferl, the youngest Sz?chenyi, is a comely roguel There"s absolutely no logic in his thoughts! His mother has already tried to find him a wife... but all the available young ladies are revolted by him! He won the Leipzig Battle for Field-Marshal Schwarzenberg! Tall tales. He led the Swedish Crown-Prince in the war against Napoleon! Your stepmother isn"t swayed by such nonsense! I never liked weapons! Your alluring Selina appears to be wearing a bridal gown. Who"s that alluring woman there with that weed Zichy? - Who got seven children as a wedding present! - Not eight? Dearest Princess, permettez moi. Countess Seilern-Anspang, my beautiful Crescence! Princess Lichnowsky, Her Ladyship"s kin to us, Christine ...and her youngest daughter, Countess Selina Meade. Both from Vienna. - Bonjiour, mamanl - Will you be late for your wedding too?

I hope your trip wasn"t too tiring. Dearest Selina! Stefferl! - Maman behaves so strangely! - My dearest! You"re the only one I could be happy with! And that matters! Such tranquillity! You, dearest, are an exceptional creature! Believe me! You"ll be pleased at such an audience at your presentation! Stefferl S z?chenyi, the youngest Count S z?chenyi. - Countess! - Count! L"m extremely pleased, that you brought your daughter to us! Lt"s absurd that Hungary does not have a permanent bridge! And how much will your bridge cost, Count S z?chenyi? 120,000 Pounds Sterling! Which I intend to collect from the Hungarian aristocracy"s gifts. So that just anyone can traipse across it?! That was only figurative from Stefferl. Don"t take it seriously! The construction would bring industry to Hungary! - Imagine! - L"ve been to England! And I saw how industry brings misery to the masses. Don"t worry, dearest borther of mine! I didn"t forget about you! I brought something you"ll be especially pleased about! Seeing as technology serves as an extravagance around here! Attention! Stefferl showed me one of these at Lady Holland"s in London ...when I complained about the burden of the many cocktails. Ladies and Gentleman! I sit on it thus... - What are these? - An account of his travels, Maman! Now I stand... I pull it and you can all have a look inside! Pretty whirpool, isn"t it? I risked my life smuggling this gas-generator out of Britain. Smuggling industrial secrets is punished with death! Caroline! - Sterrerl"s to ask for my hand today! - You"re so pitiful! L"ll bring this flame into use in my home! This will illuminate the S z?chenyi Castle! Flame into the villages and towns! Your husband is absolutely right! Do as he says! Maman, l"m living in a prison... Excuse me! This must be inaugurated by the most beautiful guest present! Liar! Don"t believe a word he says! Hypocrite! Promises! Empty promises! Big words! No emotion? L"ve decided to remain ...cheerful, dispassionate and single till my death! Lt"s rumoured in Vienna that you won"t marry Selina! May I offer to take charge of the young lady? I address this question as one prospective major to another! Fine! I wouldn"t give her to anyone but you! Then: ? la bonheur! - No! - That"s all? - That"s all: No! - Captain Clam-Martinitz! Herr Graf! - Wait here for me! Captain Clam Martinitz; Mehrwelt lancer division! - Prince Metternich! - You recently spent time in London with Captain S z?chenyi, did you not? - Your Excellency personally issued us passports. - Yes, but not to make statements in British society such as... I quote: The Habsburg Monarchy has one hundred years remaining at best its countries independence, the disintegration is necessary. I made no such statement, and I don"t remember one like it! I don"t know anybody more loyal to the Emperor. This report indicates that you were present, when your friend made these intolerable remarks! I might not recall it because The Count"s intellect is so unfathomable! L"m more familiar with it than you. L"m also aware how unsettled a true comrade-in-arms can become by the news of his friend"s disregard! Especially when that comrade- in-arms is awarded the rank that Captain S z?chenyi will have to wait some time for! You, son, are hereby promoted to the rank of Major! And you mustn"t feel ashamed in front of Count S z?chenyi! Herr Major Graf Clam-Martinitz! You"d be wise to better select your friends in the future! - I demand that you Return my letters. - Everyone knows... that you loved me! And hugged me! I just didn"t know then what a coward you really were. You want to ruin plotting against me! I know! - I could if I wanted! - Is that right?! - I could! So that you"ll never forget me! You"d still see my name everywhere, even if you burn... all my letters! Even if you take a wife, even if you think... I demand that you leave my brother alone! A brother can be forgiven for what happened but a wife, never! You don't know what virtue is. The angel of your misfortune has arrived. 'Dearest sonl In your absence... the God almighty may summon me from the earth. I'm unable to give you my fatherly blessing while on my death bed. I wish you renewal by the mercy of God, because you can start in accordance with... a newly discovered inner voice. This relates only to goodness, because in all things, good is far greater than evil. Look at the faltering peoples how they're searching for the moment of renewal. Nowadays, fire no longer falls from the skies... to simply convert a Paulus. In the name of God, eternal and almighty, the Father and jiudge, I bless you henceforth. ' Vienna, 1822 Let me congratulate you on your appointment as Court Advisor, You should consider changing to political career! L"d rather roast coffee beans in America! Byron! His majesty summons! I shall entrust my wife to you! At your service! You consider me a monkey in this menagerie here! I don"t know you... Captain S z?chenyi! We have much in common! Can you tell me what we have in common? All I know is that you are attempting to embarrass me. I don"t understand why. What have I done to deserve this, Count? You know something about me! You"re the only one to know I can acquire the greatest ever your admiration, Crescence! If that"s what you think, then we should end this conversation! No! You"re my only hope! Please! Don"t torment me! That"s not why we invited you here, Count! Please, forgive me! Please don"t be so cruel, Captain S z?chenyi! And where are those wounds? A scar across my back, a bullet wound, and a stabbed, Your Majesty. Two from the Battle of Leipzig, Your Majesty! Humility is the most genuine attestation of loyalty. The Dynasty desires your patience, Captain S z?chenyi. Vanity or loyalty. That"s your decision, Count! You begged him not to be cruel? You begged him? My wife begged that upstart?! - Carl! - Don"t utter my name! If you can"t tolerate its bearer! If my age isn"t to your liking, if our lifestyle doesn"t befit your nerves, if your days are lacking in sensation, then leave! What"s keeping you? I know what"s keeping you! He is! He is! Don Carlos! I knew it right from the start! The first sight! Him! Carl, my dearest! L"ve never spoken to you like this before. If you wish, this will never happen again! If I wish? Major! Captain S z?chenyi bittet gehorsamst um Erlaubnis, to purchase horses from Baron Wessel?nyi"s for the army under order from Major Brudern. Don"t give her to him! Don"t sell her! In the name of St. Moses, don"t sell Dali to this man! Ich brauche dieses Pferdl Was ist sein Preis? Dali is not for sale. Please, choose another horse, Count! If you speak in Hungarian, please do so more slowly, sir! My title is "Baron"! Do you think I don"t know your family? Then you know my father was a prisoner in Kufstein! That"s why you refuse to speak in German. I don"t speak German, because l"m Hungarian! I live in Hungary, you"re Hungarian too, and we should speak Hungarian in Hungary! Fine! L"ll get used to it if that"s the price of this horse! This horse has no price! Last year I rode her from Zsib? to Debrecen! Twenty-four German miles... in a single day! Can I believe that? No matter! L"ve no time for proofs! L"m back tomorrow! - I have the means to prove it! - The means. How, dear Baron? L"ll give Dali to you, Count! For free! To have proof! Pressburg, 1825 Hungarians... - perhaps, due to their Asian origins -, are a deeply suspicious nation. They"re much like the Italians! True: They"re very giving! That"s not something l"d say about Italians! However, they hardly have a sense of the practical! They"re fantasts... politically uninformed lacking experience, since they haven"t had Diet for thirteen years! What could they do in these circumstances? They"ll announce their grievances and complaints... search for a leader to take on their demands. Fine! Tell me... what"s your opinion of this Baron Wessel?nyi? He"s worthy of note! In that case, individuals cause scandal in Diet, it will be solely Hungary who pays the price! Baron Wessel?nyi must understand... that a Hungarian aristocrat"s existence... career and honour... depend solely on the Habsburg Dynasty! I assume you agree with that! Now, you may enter the house; keep your eyes open, and remain silent! And if you notice the slightest sign of nationalistic humbug... turn to me! Make way for Countess Zichy! Make way for the Honourable Countess Zichy! You should be sitting with the peers! Your Worship, as well, Baron! Aren"t you afraid, Your Worship that I may shed bad light on your significant person? No! Metternich drew my attention to your significant physique! Father"s talking! This is so boring like this! What is this noble man saying? - Count, you should brush up on your Latin! - Bene! Honourable faculties and orders! Latin or not, I will make the following proposal in Hungarian. What if Richelieu didn"t speak French? ...the English prime minister English? When a Hungarian nobleman... speaks in his mother tongue why is it indignating? L"m dizzy, mon petit garcon! What an onslught! Honourable faculties and orders! L"m outraged by something completely different! That the aristocracy doesn"t speak its nation"s language! And now I... Baron Mikl?s Wessel?nyi, put the following question: How long will you continue speaking about everything but the nation"s wounds?! How long do you plan to suck the fat from your people?! And waste the taxpayers" money on women and gambling? And not give any of it back to the nation?! Quiet! Our S z?chenyi asks for the floor! Quiet! Count S z?chenyi has something to say! - Hear! - Quiet! Honourable faculties and orders! Baron Wessel?nyi is right! Aristocrats use their assets for personal entertainment, the refinement of their senses and worthless power letchery Their conduct is detrimental! - You"re one of them! - Quiet! You"re one of those! I, too... was given everything I posses on a silver platter! L"m a man of wealth. I didn"t deserve it, only born into it! However, I wish to change! I wish to make amends because I feel in debt! Hungarian aristocracy fought the right not to pay taxes! I hereby offer one year"s income from all my estates... for the propagation of the Hungarian language! I wish a Hungarian Learned Society to be established... so that knowledge will not belong to a few! And I ask my fellow aristocrats to publicly give their support to this cause! Frankly speaking, I fear for you! You have disgraced the honour of your uniform?! The consequences will be tragic! L"m not concerned about my own fate! You played a two-faced game with us... Pretending to be ignorant and insignificant; but don"t think that you"ve outsmarted us! Does Hungary break with the Monarchy? Fine! You"ll see what the Russians are like! Understand?! L"m fond of light... but I don"t like it propagated by torches! Who plays with fire inside a locked house will burn inside! L"ve written down all my ideas of building a bridge! A bridge? But why? What do you think you are?! A pioneer infantry man? S z?chenyi! For God"s sake! I speak to the Emperor... The ink on your promotion is almost dry. Every door stands open to you provided that... provided, you come to your senses! To help my nation, I must abandon military career. Hence, I humbly request... I humbly request that I be relieved of military duty! You can"t set foot in Vienna again! You shut yourself in a muddy country! Are you referring to our beloved country, dear Lajos?! - Do you know what you"ve done?! - Great, my son! - Do you know what you"ve done?! Mon ami! - What? - He doesn"t know! - He doesn"t know! Don"t be afraid of him! He"s one of us! Hooray! Hooray for Count S z?chenyi! You must address them, Istv?n! What are you thinking about? A bridge! Rosette! Rosette, pack my things! L"m leaving for Buda! Oh, you son-of-a-bitch, you! - This can only be you! - Who? - Count S z?chenyi! Where"s Istv?n? Where"s Istv?n? How dare you be so brazen?! If you leave now, l"m finished! L"ve never loved anyone so passionately before! Neither have I! - Can I believe you? - Yes! The most important is that l"ll be near you! And I will be! - But we must never as much as touch each other! - No! Never! England, 1832 Gracious Countessl There're 3 things worth learning... from the English: Constitution horse breeding and machinesl The British constitution is so well devised and, that even the reigning ruler can be idiot he is still incapable of... causing harm, due to the lawsl Wessel?nyiand I have set off from Dover on the Comet to visit Thierney Clark, the engineer. Dear Crescencel Now that I know of your love and support, I am convinced that we, the two of us, can only be jioined by way of the advancement of our nationl Follow us! Mr. Clark! We need a bridge in Hungary across the Danube, spanning 1,600 feet! But no one in Hungary believes this possible! What is your opinion about that, Sir? Everything depends on the piers" distance, Sir! Mr. Thierney Clark! I want a bridge that will serve as a symbol for the future! - So that great structures may be built around it! - If not... then shame on the future! That"s right! If not then shame on the future! Mr. Clark! The commission is yours! - Bonjiour, Stephanl - Bonjiour, Carll Enfinl Les dieux viennent toujiours au bon momentl Bonjiourl Nicolausl Vous aussil Our warmest welcome to you both, gentlemen! Voilal These are all for you! - Mother and father won"t get anything! - Why?! - We received very few letters from you lately! - That"s right! Any news about the English heir apparent? We"re thirsting for news! News from London! But quickly! Apologies! Stephan, apologies! As you can see, l"m the one making excuses for the incident but Crescence is still busy preparing herself! Gracious Countess! We"re so pleased to see you! Crescence often mentions you sometimes as the world"s greatest, then the worst man! Do I deserve it? My friend! You"re aspiring for a greater honour! Dearest! The honour is ours, because our Stephan is here with us again! Let"s not keep the guests waiting! My friends! Hooray! Crescence! Look at that young man Wessel?nyi"s talking to! - Hooray for the bridge builder! - Hooray! Hooray! - See that young man? - Crescence, dearest! A lawyer introduced a few days ago! Crescence! I can"t stand this any longer! We vowed sincerity to each other! He"s called Kossuth! He asked me to introduce him to you. It may sound dreadful but you must know everything! I wish someone would love me, the way S z?chenyi loves! When Carl whispered his sugary drivel to me... a voice inside me said: Slap him across the face! My love! I feel being devoured by you! Control yourself! Crescence seems moved! So she should be! She"s getting the greatest love of all! Carl doesn"t want anything bad! I! I want something bad! I want you! L"m choking from the pretence! Everyone"s clutching at me! Pushing me higher and higher! Where I can"t support myself! - Thank me for the dance! - Carl is petty, not worthy of us! Just imagine... I wished for his death earlier! - Should I just forsake you? - Thank me for the dance, Count! - I love you, Crescence! - Thank me for the dance! Thank me for the dance! You can"t do this to S z?chenyi! Long live the establisher of the Learned Societyl This young man, Lajos Kossuth, is a great fan of yours! L"d gladly assist you, Count in your political pursuits! I have absolutely no political pursuits. I support only the good! The advancement of our country! Long live Hungary! That"s all I can say: Long live Hungary! Istv?n! Everyone here wants you! You can"t leave now! Don"t push the masses away! They"ll drop you as they raised you on their shoulders! They"re cheering you! So enjoy it, Count! Hooray! Hooray! Long live Hungary! S z?chenyi"s pictures are posted in county administration offices Anything else? He dreams of Hungary to be equal with Vienna... Enough! Continue! - He"s organizing a Steamship Company... - Continue! - He urged an independent banking system. - We"ve read it! With the well known opposition figure he"s establishing... a secret weapons reserve... in London co-operating in Lady Holland"s salon... - where Wessel?nyi stated that... - Wessel?nyi! Wessel?nyi! No! No! I, Baron Mikl?s Wessel?nyi! I accuse the government! - He"s right! - I accuse the government... of attacking me by infringing on freedom of speech! That's rightl He's rightl This is unbelievablel If the government... brands me as... subversive and treasonous, claiming that by judging them l"m attacking the King himself! Hooray for Baron Wessel?nyil Absolutely rightl This government... in the most conceited way has substituted itself for the King himself... That's rightl Down with the governmentl ...hence is itself guilty of treason! ...Kossuth and his group reporting on the Diet! Hungarian press! ...their sin! Baron Wessel?nyi! Lt"s not Colonel Clam-Martinitz is it? Your passions aren"t tolerated by us! As for passions, I was the instigator! So duel with me! - You must be aware that his sight... - Don"t worry about it! I see the point on the Colonel that l"m going to aim for! Excuse me, gentlemen! The middle of his forehead! My nobler side"s talking to the scum! - You aren"t aware... - That you"re effected by him! But the colonel... Their true aim"s to lock me up for duel. But I get young when I come across a swine! Gratitude"s always rebellion! Shooting a stinking Hungarian is a great pleasure for me! Our seconds will discuss the details! So, you stinking Hungarian: Will you be my second? Why are you obsessed with going to prison? Am I in your way, Istv?n? Do you destroy what I accomplish? L"d be grateful, Count... if you"d tell me when you hold your speech about the bridge. L"d like to include it in my reports on the Diet. Include my anger to your insolent friends... or I will, but then they"ll hear no thanks from me! L"m deeply shaken, I cannot find words. Carl always held you in high esteem. This watch was a present from Carl. It fell and broke... precisely four days ago when... It still shows the same time. Is this when it happened? Please, we must consider her situation! I ask only one thing: Please, accept my offer of assistance! I ask the Countess not take any steps regarding her own... or her children"s matters without first informing me! - Carl would have approved of this! - My daughter asks you to keep distance from her in the future! Takes her bereavement on me? I demand that you intercede, Madam Countess! Her decision is final, Count S z?chenyi! - Three villages for one horsel - Was it at least a good horse? Yes, but it was weather beaten and blind in one eye! Humble greetings, Sire! May I speak with you privately, Mr. Lawyer? What"s this then? You may be unaware of the difficulties founding the club? I had to quell Vienna"s jealousy, because they didn"t like Hungarian magnates gathering... anywhere other than the imperial city! This establishment has provided positive energy for the country! Now even Metternich is a member of the Pest Gentlemen"s Club! And not just he will think that this has become some sort of... subversive den if Lajos Kossuth is accepted as a member! Hence, I kindly ask you to withdraw your request! Why don"t you publicly reject it? - You enjoy great popularity! - Does the Count think that if I were to merely sit in an armchair and read a newspaper, light up a cigar then the building would collapse?! - Yes! - But Baron Wessel?nyi is also a member of your club! Vienna"s so afraid of him that they charged him with treason! L"ve not had the pleasure of such honour! You soon may have! - Why are you doing this? - You hate me. That"s very regrettable. But you"ll see, you"re looking for allies in wrong places. I won"t be an inconvenience to you any longer. I appreciate your understanding. But my sincere respect I feel for you... will not be altered! Is that because Wessel?nyi recommended him? The two things have nothing to do with each other. Or because Wessel?nyi"s been charged? Because you"re too much of a coward to show that bastard Metternich that the opposition has objections? Because you want a bridge... for the Austrian army to march across? Scum is what you are, Louis! I won"t duel with you! You could make an exception and shoot me, my friend Louis Batth?ny! En garde, messieursl Etes-vous prets? Allezl Stop! There now! There"s no point in carrying on like that! Baron Wessel?nyi! I arrest you for illicit duel with an officer of the emperor! Would you inform me of the government"s intentions of arresting Kossuth and Wessel?nyi? Count S z?chenyi! Congratulations on your appointment as Royal Commissioner of Transportation. You are now a Secret Counsellor! "Your Excellency!" Present your favourite ideas: Road and railway construction, river-regulation concepts; we"ll support them! Baron Wessel?nyi is almost completely blind! Calm down, please! Please, take a seat, Your Excellency! We won"t be inhumane! Give a little consideration: Your work can only progress... while these Jacobin tempers are kept under control! Those tempers went wild as a result of oppressive politics! You"re concerned about your popularity. There"s no need to be, Your Excellency! Our secret reports indicate your popularity as unimpaired! Wish you the best for your work in the future... Oh, yes! The government supports your bridge too! Due to the arrests, you"re so unpopular... that Hungary will turn against the bridge if supported! Hence, I kindly ask Your Excellency to keep your intentions confidential! Lower Danube Count! Quarantine officers have come aboard! Count! - Where am I? - If they realize... fever on board, they"ll quarantine us... - and we"ll never leave! - Who are you? Mih?ly Kiss! Your secretary! Quickly! - Speak to him to keep him conscious! - Yes! - Count, we must get to the sea! - Where"s Crescence? We want to make the Danube navigable, Count! The officers are very irate! Quarantined, we"ll never get out of here! - Do you have the strength? - Me? Lead the way! L"m Royal Commissioner with Letter of Credence. From the Archduke and the Chancellor. No ranks during an epidemic! L"m Count Stephan S z?chenyi! The author of "Credit"? - I read... - An evil one! I wrote about the need for trust of the Emperor and serfs. What trust? You only incited the peasants! - The Emperor"s dead! - His Majesty?! His heart was broken by your and Wessel?nyi"s disobedience! There"s no doubt about Baron Wessel?nyi"s loyalty! Denying?! This is Count S z?chenyi! He"s defending the rebels! Why aren"t you in jail with them? Which side are you on? Where do you belong to? Are you coward or cunning? Declare yourself! Everything affecting masses is an epidemic! You're the cause of the epidemicl You personally are the epidemicl Count! Count! The pass! No letters! Tell the Countess, if need be, S z?chenyi will stand here until his death! I wish to hear her if she respects me! Do your duty! Allez-vous enl - Why must I personally ask you to enter? - The Countess asks? You forbade me to set foot inside your gate! You haven"t let me near you for 2 years! You"re still vain, superficial and heartless, Count S z?chenyi! I agree! But it"s no reason why you should be the same! - I apologized! - I still can"t enter that gate! And if I... if I were to humbly ask you? - Would you? - Under one condition! Fine then, name it! If I may ask for your hand in marriage! Then please... Count! Pest-Buda, 1839 German Theatre in Pest, 1840 Countess! She"s said to be unwell since the birth! Countess! Istv?n"s worried about her! But he"s worried enough, anyway. Hooray for Sz?chenyil Count! Lieber Stephanl Gracious Countess! Long live S z?chenyi! Hooray for everyone loyal to Hungary! Hooray for Kossuth! Kossuth"s free! Kossuth"s out of prison! Kossuth wants to speak! L"ve been forbidden to speak! You"ve no alternative. Work with him! You"re waited for! Greet him! Play the R?k?czi Marchl We don't want the Imperial Antheml We don't want the Imperial Antheml Police! Where are the police at times like this? Calm down! Count S z?chenyi! You"ve lost the confidence of the nation! Chaos, not bridge! Water! Water! Pest, February 1848 Talk to him now! Now you can talk to him, Count! Louis Batthy?ny has come from the Diet! The Diet has gone mad! The news of Paris revolution made Kossuth bite! We can"t let him destroy Hungary becoming a dictator! Come and help us! You worshipped him until now, Louis! You are the most prestigious member of his party, Louis! I agree to fight with Vienna, but not to the death, like Kossuth! How many of you are there? S zentkir?lyi and the three L?nyaies. S zentkir?lyi must meet with Metternich in secrecy! The King should send a letter of apology for the grievances! Read it to the house... You"ll all cheer... and Kossuth will be left on his own! Everyone will forget that he ever existed! Time! We must win time! But then you must come to Pressburg too! - You can"t do this, he"s ill! - Me?! Louis! Go back to the Diet! L"ll follow you! Kiss! Instruct the staff to pack! I don"t wish to continue grievance politics... but to sever, such grievances once and for all! The government... has often broken our laws since the last session of Diet! That's rightl This nation is not underage! It is not a minor... to be disciplined from Vienna! That's rightl Hooray for Kossuthl Quickly! We"re just in time! They"ve just read it! - Voting? - Just started! Lt"s a trick! A vile fraud! Fraudl Sit downl Quietl I must express my astonishment... over the opposition"s response to the royal ordinance! If you refuse this ordinance... and aren"t prepared to reply with a loyal petition... that would be so illogical that I could only attribute it to Mr. Kossuth"s terroristic power and influence over you! No one can terrorize us, not even Sz?chenyil I suggest that we put the matter to the vote! What am I holding in my hand? A letter! A letter from Vienna sent to me by a true patriot! In this letter he exposes the plan of a mean scheme, completely unknown to the public, formulated in absolute secrecy, to divide the opposition! Hearl And who do you think, gentlemen, is behind this conspiracy? Hearl Mr. Representative is trying to prevent the voting! Who is behind this conspiracy? Read the letterl Quietl Quietl Representatives L?nyay and S zentkir?lyi! Bastards! Representatives L?nyay and S zentkir?lyi, who feel that Kossuth"s power and influence is so excessive that they secretly conducted negotiations with Metternich! And where did this crafty idea spring from? Who first brought light to this home... and is now quartermaster of the powers of darkness! Having listened to this philippic, let"s vote! He's rightl Do so if you wish, Your Excellency! But we"ll fight until the last hour... and there will never again be peace in this Diet! That's rightl We won't give upl Down with the governmentl And there won"t ever be peace between us, Count S z?chenyi! That's rightl That's rightl Down with the governmentl There"s revolution in... May I ask Mr. Representative of Pest County to come with me? - We have a plan! - He"s right! Let"s put the past behind us! As Vienna"s near the revolution... ...there"s a proposal here. You"re offered a ministerial position... along with me in an independent Hungarian government! This is what we"ll demand from Vienna! The prime minister... will be Count Lajos Batthy?ny! Now we can achieve everything you ever wanted! - Absolute power and guarantees... - 'Guarantees. ' Got that? Then continue: Complete secrecy, by every means, everyone must obey me! But our family name, Stefan! Our father"s name! There are my head, family and estates! I am worthy of this! You want power Vienna"s never provided! Kossuth tears Hungary from the Monarchy! If need be, bayonets will be my guarantee! You"re denying your entire life! I can"t believe this! Count S z?chenyi wishes to be Hungary"s dictator? Count S z?chenyi wants power to dissolve the rebel Diet! Batthy?ny and Kossuth want independent government! Batthy?ny and Kossuth are Count S z?chenyi"s pupils! You must now acknowledge that! Who mixes with the fodder will be consumed by the swine! As I predicted earlier! There"s no need to worry! We"ll block this rebellion! We"ll simply lock the building, and the arsonists will remain trapped inside! The dynasty shall remain firm! We won"t be compassionate! After suppressing the rebellion in Vienna, Hungary"s the next! In that case, chaos will reign! And Hungary will be finished, along with all my work! Who does he think he is? King of Hungary? L"m the King there! Isn"t that so? We reject your exaggerated proposal! Lt"s we who are responsible for Hungary! And not him! The game"s over! But they"ll come running to me yet! Then a huge voice will say: Lt"s too late! The Monarchy"s eternal! The emperor reigns by God"s grace! The army is strong! The army is in Italy! These maniacs can do whatever they want! Until the army returns, Count S z?chenyi! There"ll be bloodshed all over! L"m reading from the stars! Races will attack other races! The gates of houses will be labelled with marks! And what there"re will be deprived of! Captain S z?chenyi! Pressburg, 15 March 1848 Long live S z?chenyi! Gentlemen! I accept the position of minister! Count S z?chenyi is with us! He"ll present our demands! Long live S z?chenyi, the greatest Hungarian! This isn"t what I wanted but economic growth first. Now I also say: Let the horses bolt if only the cart would arrive safely! But we must go on! We must go even further now as they"ll agree to everything! We must demand the installation of our government signed by the emperor! Oh Magyars, stand beside your land unshaken... Here is your crib, your future grave... V You"re right! Lt"s the Chancellor! Come on, fellow citizens! Let"s hang him! Listen here! L"m trying to flee! Haven"t you noticed? - Leaving? - l"ll never set foot in Vienna again! He"s leaving! You see, Melanie, ma ch?re... this is a grown-up nation! In revolution it doesn"t insist on the consequences! Unlike the Hungarians! Metternich is leaving! He"s leaving! 'Dearest Crescence, darling Muttil The first act went splendidlyl Government hasn't been celebrated like ours... when we moved to Pestl Hungary will now revolve around its own axis finallyl And if chaos can be avoided we will have a magnificent futurel As a member of the government... I'm pleased about the important roles of Batthy?ny and Kossuth. God knows there isn't any trace of jiealousy in my soul. I again believe that something good will become of Hungaryl Our house in Pest is an office. We, the first independent government of Hungary... after introducing general taxes, liberating the serfs... performing civilian programme, we wish to provide employment for the massesl Grosch... our silly old butler growls occasionally... but tugging his ear I jiust laughl I laugh a lot, Crescence... since you are all safe and well in the country. ' There will be a celebration tomorrow! The last chain will be hoisted onto the bridge! Then everything will be in perfect trim! Yes... But these guns! Lt"s so beautiful! And so huge! Just as he wanted! I regularly provide the Count with news from the city. And I take his afternoon tea to the Cabinet sessions! What about general feeling aroung here like, Grosch? There"s been much coming and going... since we liberated the serfs! They demand rents to be cancelled in public meetings. However, the Count is extremely optimistic! Yes, yes... - But these guns! - Why don"t you put it down? If it"s such a burden! Grosch? A bloody battle in Buda. Cuirassiers and grenadiers dispersed the crowd. The beginning of the endl 200 scoundrels broke into the chamber demanding weapons. The emperor is ostensibly sick and refuses to come to Buda. Kossuth is cocky, as if we had a hundred thousand armed men. Jelacic has set out against us with Croatian guns. Bloodshed comesl As defenseless, we must build fortificationsl I'm the reason that Kossuth and Batthy?ny are so high up now. Lord, forgive mel My intentions were noble and peaceful. We're going to devour each other like ratsl The bridge won't be completed or it will without mel My soul opened last night: It's impossible to end welll Yesterday Grosch woke me... and I grabbed his neck like a madman. I almost... ...killed him. The Count has arrived! Please, put down his diary! Otherwise he may strangle you My lady! Crescence! Crescence! Ma viel Crescence! Perfect! Perfect! Are you listening? Everything is perfect! He promised! The King is wonderful! - Isn"t he ill? - He promised... as soon as he got well... he promised! Lmmediately, - the King"s to come, dearest! - He wouldn"t! Who do you believe? I told you, as soon as he can! - I just... - Why can"t you understand? Finally, everything I wanted is being fulfilled! L"m lucky! Finally, l"m lucky as well! This is what l"ve been waiting for! The Emperor will move here... and Hungary becomes an island of peace! With Kossuth l"ll maintain order! The Dynasty will govern the Empire from here! By then the bridge will stand completed in all its glory! A glorious nation... rising from its ashes! Meanwhile, Europe is in total chaos! The pride of humanity: Order, peace and freedom! And it"s me who started this! Me! Me! Crescence! Tomorrow! Everything will be decided tomorrow! Ham gives strength, but salmon also gives full-bloodedness! Grosch! Did you call the Count? Would you like me to call him again? No, it"s all right! Leave it to the "vice-butler"! Lt"s 18 July 1848. I have not been able to sleep since two this morning... If the last chain is successfully hoisted into place ...the twelfth chain... then everything may still turn out for the better. This is the eleventh hourl I wonder what the strike of this hour will bring? I know, I feel that I am in the hands of higher powersl Heaven or hell? Heaven or hell? Heaven or hell? Maman! They"re coming! Hooray! Outstanding achievement! L"m speechless! I wouldn"t have believed it. The two-chain winds onto... Vati! Lt"s our bridge, isn"t it? No! No! No!!! No! No! Let me through! Out of the way, please! Let me through! Stop it! What are you doing?! Get away from there! Lt"s twisted! I know that they are twirled! I want several men to help lift it! The lower section also has to be raised! Quickly! The lower section has to be raised! I know everything! I am the anti-Christ! I am the cause of everything! I kill all those I love! I am the murderer of Hungary! Grosch! Ice! It can"t be stopped! I shouldn"t have spoken up then! I started it all! I shouldn"t have stirred it up! How happy this country could have been without me! By now... If breaking with Vienna is raised l"ll resign. I trusted the King! But he sent his army against us! If I have to, I prefer Hungary to the King, unlike Your Highness? He"s our enemy! I bought 24000 guns in England, gentlemen! We need Hungarian army and officers! We swore an oath to the King! Then should we perish, dear Minister? No! We need weapons! That"s an answer! The promised weapons haven"t arrived! The factory"s head cancelled the delivery! Martial law should be applied! No martial law! How much longer can it be put up with, Prime Minister? Save yourself! Get out of here! I mustn"t see you anymore! Take this woman out of here! L"m going to kill her! Get out of here, Crescence! Save yourself! Crescence, save yourself! Get out of here! L"m sorry, my husband cannot see you at the moment! The government... The government investigated the case of the bridge. Rest assured, Countess! Crime is out of the question. It was an accident! It was an accident, Honourable Transportation Minister! Count S z?chenyi! For God"s sake! What is the matter with you? You must understand! He did everything he could! He"s in need of immediate hospital care! My friends! You know that I only ever wanted what was good! But I have a fever now! L"m seriously ill! L"m burning, gentlemen! Burning up! Please let me leave! For God"s sake! You can leave! Leave! You"re in need of rest! There will be no problems! Matters in progress will be taken care of! And we"ll gladly take control over ministry responsibility. If you entrust me with that l"ll gladly do it myself! You will? I said... I would, gladly! Thank God! What a relief! Thank you! Thank you very much! L"m leaving then! My friends! God be with you; all of you! Every one of you! D?bling, 7 September 1848 - Who is this man? - The Count! The greatest Hungarian! The minister of the rebels! How could the emperor approve him being brought here? Count! You"re completely safe in this place befitting your standing. My private insane asylum is... full of aristocratic patients! No harm can come to you here. After Sz?chenyi's collapse the government resigned. There started a war of independence suppressed in the summer of 1849. Dozens of Hungarians were executed, and hundreds of them were put in prison. The above-named Count called upon Hungary to oppose its Lord and King. He reinforced the subversive party and helped the rebellionl The above-named Count instituted an army, and employed seditious measures to encourage Hungary... to rebel against His Majiesty. Thus Count Lajos Batthy?ny has been found guilty of high-treason. He is sentenced to confisction and death by hanging! The sentence is to be announced and executed without delay on 6 October 1849, by order of Lieutenant-General Clam, Senior Military Judge. The sentence is "death by hanging"! The convict tried to cut his throat in his cell. The knife was smuggled in by his wife. - Mercy for the condemned! - Mercy is with God! - Mercy for the condemned! - Mercy is with God! - Mercy for the condemned! - Mercy is with God! Long live Hungary! Allez, Jaeger! Who the fool dared tell him? Who gave him this newspaper? I didn"t know he could read! You"ll ruin him! My wealthiest patient! Everyone is asleep. They sleep without dreaming together with you. Hungary has forgotten itself. Just like you. They won"t wake up. Doctor Goergen warned me that you still don"t wish to see me! However, l"m warning you: If you don"t return to this dreadful world, Hungary will remain in this lifeless dream! And your two sons... will forget the name of their country, just as they will forget yours! You will become nothing, just like Hungary... which will soon be overgrown with weeds! And already overgrew your gravestone. You"ll destroy everything! Years of efforts! His physiological index... They say... that you feel fine here! They say that you"ve hidden here! Hence the Emperor can remain calm! Don"t worry... l"ll never arrive unannounced again. Wake up, Right Honourable Count S z?chenyi! Vienna 1860 Would you disclose your name, child? Police Minister, Adolf Thierry at your service. Thierry... Aren"t you a baron? I am! Your Excellency! Is that something to be ashamed of nowadays? Lt"s a pleasure to see Your Highness! Thanks to Your Majesty"s clemency... I no longer breathe London air. We"re in need of your experience. Mr. Minister! - You"re familiar with the opinion of the Monarchy. - Yes. Malice everywhere! Continue! In this adverse political climate Hungary disciplined... now gives a handle to hostile powers to present an unfavourable picture of the Monarchy. Certainly! Using the reviling statements of Kossuth, fled to Italy, and the handful of others in exile! But who listens to them today? Continuae! Recently, a new voice has emerged. Not the usual subversive or accusatory but a meanly sarcastic and fiendishly malign voice defaming His Majesty himself! A yellow book was published anonymous in London! Treasonous articles in the London Times! The anonymous author lives near Vienna! He corresponds with the English Foreign Minister and the French Emperor. And who might this demigod be? - Who considers himself to be just that! - Count S z?chenyi. Count S z?chenyi is mad! For ten years he"s been vegetating in a lunatic asylum. Our information is reliable. L"m sure, his train of thought is completely incoherent! And if you now plan to expose the Count to police execution, you"ll achieve nothing other... than causing Hungary, still confused of reprisal to revolt for the martyr. It provides matter for the bad opinion of the Monarchy! We are most grateful. Your Majesty! Felsenthal! Mr. Felsenthal, Police Inspector charged with... the S z?chenyi case. He"s colleague Necasek. And he"s colleague Prandtner. As their opinion, his state of mind is excellent. We have a handwritten document by him reviling the Monarchy. One of Count S z?chenyi"s nurses makes regular reports to us. We must find out if this manuscript justifies a search of his quarters! - I don"t want a scandal! - We"re going to be discreet. It might pay to look around his secretary"s quarters, - you know, that Kiss character! - We already have! We searched his apartment from where he goes to the asylum. - Leaflets? - Nothing! Only lost of chess books! Chess books? Kiss! Enchant?l The night squealers are relieving the day ones! All this trouble for a madman! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! With your permission Count... l"ll take this with this knight! Your room was searched in your absence, Kiss! They stole handwritten pages from me! We"ve become the centre of attention! A la bonheurl Years of darkness have ceased around me. This is mind-boggling Kiss! Burdens are falling from me... while the celebration of the resurrection grows angel-wings! With due respect, Count, I see the situation different! Picayune, Kiss! When do you realize you"re in the house of miracles? Shh! Just listen... to the harmonious snoring of my ground-floor companions! That heaving of the waves! For ten years I haven"t even noticed that melody! Enjoy life with me a little! Kiss! Good evening, doctor! Yes, you can leave! This way, please! The reason for his chess skills may be an intact brain-lobe... He plays chess?! Skilfully! He"s skilful at chess! A single brain-section... remaining intact miraculously, occasionally provides him with lucid intervals! He has distinguished visitors he converses with as equals! D?bling has become a passage under your supervision! - Excuse me! - Count S z?chenyi is a completely harmless, kind lunatic and that"s my resolute professional opinion! He"s as incapable of agitation, as of political conspiracy! So, Count, you wish... to provoke a court trial. Not a bad idea, Kiss! Well, yes! L"m playing defensively! I want to play defense and counterattack as well. Make your move! And don"t think so much! Just easy, take it easy! Just like algae, old boy! And strategize, always strategize! Presumably they"re relying on their superiority. But... this isn"t the end of the game! We"ll soon have visitors, Kiss! You must prepare for them, son! A double diversion! What is it, Kiss? Were you frightened by your own bastion? What if we were to put this madman to a state asylum? That would lead to his rapid decline! As his doctor, I take the liberty of protesting! But who could possibly... authorize you to take such actions?! You promised me coffee! Where is my coffee? Ma ch?rel It appears we"re to have guests! Finally! Mr. Felsenthal! - Count! - You look as I imagined you! - L"m... - No excuses, please! You"ve come to conduct a search! Yes. With the permission of the Minister of Police! - The"re from the cipher department. - I knew it! L"m aware of the interest in my writings, this is extremely satisfying! But why is it so difficult to identify those writings? - May I? - I heard, for instance, that the yellow book... - "Ein Blick". - What? "Blick"? The "Blick" is attributed to me! I protest! What clumsy style! Follow me! Crescence! Please, forgive foolish head, ma viel I haven"t introduced the gentlemen! The Police Inspector. - Gnaedige Graefin! - The brain behind this flattering search. - And his promising adjutants! - Necasek! - Prandtner! My wife is currently visiting me, otherwise she resides in Vienna. But why am I telling you this? Presumably, even at this moment your men are ransacking her house! Our apologies for the inconvenience! But why? After all, you have your orders! 11 English language newspapers: Times, Les Temps. That"s French. Three postcards from Paris. A 231 page document, to be seized. It"s in German. You"re putting yourself in danger, my darling. Hungary awaits a sign. And they are the ones to give it! Since you"ll be put on trial? My voice will carry far from there! I knew you"d realize my intentions, Crescence! What are you preparing for? As usual! For the effective, always the most effective! Excuse me! Are you pondering? Yes! About a person who, after long tome of intellectual collapse, wants to interfere in the high politics of the Monarchy. He wants a new government and slanders the Emperor. Un moment, un momentl As I know that person only attacked the government because it punished his homeland, with reprisal and darkness! He hasn"t attacked the Emperor! He wants to inform His Majesty of the improper actions! I studied your life story, Count. Mine has never been a life! I wasn"t worthy of its beauty! And? - What did you decipher from it? - That you"ve changed your style! Would you tell me... what you trust in so much? The resurrection! He"s a self-important old man desiring publicity, finally, to draw Hungary"s attention. Don"t you see he"s playing at it?! He"s using the sanatorium as a refuge. - He must step out! - He must be insignificant! He"s corresponding with heads of hostile states! He wants to anticipate reconciliation... between the Dynasty and Hungary! Lt"s obvious that Your Majesty is the only one to determine its time! His methods consist of arrogant incitement and insolent abusing. He should get down on his knees! You don"t really know Count S z?chenyi! His knee-joints work slightly differently. Thank you, Your Highness! There"s no need for a trial! S z?chenyi is in a hurry. S z?chenyi is mad. S z?chenyi... is dangerous! S z?chenyi must disappear! Dearest! 8 April 1860 Every time I touch you I think of them attempting your life! L"ve decided not to set foot again outside this building. You"ll never again see me alive in the world outside. - Regardless of how dreadful it is to be heard. - Nothing heard from Count S z?chenyi can be dreadful! If only you"d tell me how much longer I may hear your words? Crescence! Beloved! Crescence! My beloved! They"re all mad! They"ll never get the better of me! They still don"t understand that l"m a separate sphere! But you know it! Just you, don"t you? Grosch! If my gracious Countess catches cold driving to Vienna ...you"re fired! Grosch! Understand?! Merry resurrection, gentlemen! What do you want from him? What do you want from him? No one can set foot in there! Get out of here! Lt"s the day of the resurrection! Is he insane then or not? That miserable Czech head of yours can"t possibly grasp the consequences of what comes! "The Monarchy murdered Count S z?chenyi!" The Emperor of France will be slapping his knee in delight! - And in Hungary... - Mr. Minister! The Countess demands the deceased"s personal belongings! Then tell her that His Majesty has ordered a closed funeral. - Understand? - Yes sir. In the greatest of secrecy! The Countess will understand. Have you come to have someone shot Lieutenant-General? The country was staggered by the news of his death. The mourning got into silent protest against absolutism. The wars lost and Hungary's resistance forced Franz Joseph into the Compromise in 1867. The Academy and the Chain Bridge are still standing in the centre of Budapest. Greater Supporters
