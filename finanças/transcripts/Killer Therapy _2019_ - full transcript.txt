Brian, honey, please stop kicking the machine. It's brand new. Let's see. She's gonna love that. Why do I gotta have a sister? Brian, please. We have a lot to share, and Aubrey needed a home. But she's not part of our family. Just because she's adopted does not mean that she's not part of the family. You understand? Honey? I guess. What if Dad likes her more than me? Oh, honey. Brian, your daddy loves you very much. Nothing is ever gonna change that. Hey, ever. So you be Mommy's good little monster and try to like your new sister. I'll try. Okay, that's all I want. Thank you. Ooh. Every time, you scare me, every time. This is perfect. Brian, come on, honey, uncross your arms. Come on, stand up straight. Hi. Say hello to your new sister, Brian. Come on. Hi. Welcome to your new home, Aubrey. "Do you know what friendship is, he asked. "Yes, replied the gypsy. "It is to be a brother and a sister." Very good, Aubrey. Okay, Brian, you read this one. "Two souls which touch "without." I don't know this word. That's okay, sound it out. "Mingling." Great job, honey, yeah. That was good. Mm hmm. I don't wanna read anymore. Okay, well, you know what? It's getting late anyway, so, Aubrey, why don't you go on, and I'm gonna say goodnight to Brian, and then I'm gonna come tuck you in. Oh, don't forget your book. Good night, Brian. Say it. Say it. Good night. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Good night, Mommy. Good night, baby! Good night, baby! Good night, baby! Good night, good night, good night! Okay, okay. All right, I love you, get in there. Brian hates me. Oh, honey, he doesn't hate you. It's just gonna take some time. You'll see, I bet it'll be a much better day tomorrow. I don't hate him. Aubrey, you are so sweet. And so is Brian. He's just, he's a little different. He really doesn't mean all the bad things he says. You understand? Mm hmm. Wait a second. Aw, he's cute. This is Mr. Wiggles. My parents gave him to me, so he used to be mine, but now he's yours. Thank you. Um... Oh, well, you can call me Mommy or whatever you'd like. Thank you, Mommy. I like that. I like that. Here. Okay, now you go to bed and, if you need anything, I'll be right down the hall, okay? All right. All right. Oh, light on or off? - On, please. - Okay. Nah, no. Yeah, no, I think you should take it. Yeah, that house is gonna go fast at that price. It's a good deal. We're not gonna find another deal like that for a long time. No, inventory's way low in that area. I'm telling you. Look, no, I gotta go. Think about what I said. Okay, I'll call you in the morning. Okay, so long. Thank you. Brian, you haven't touched your food. I'm not hungry. Brian, eat. How's your dinner, Aubrey? Good, thank you. Good. How was school this week, Brian? Brian. It was fine. Aubrey, you start next week. Canyon School, it's a really great school. I think you're gonna like it. It sucks. Brian. Do you wanna go to your room without supper? I don't care. Aubrey might like the school, Brian. Get your own mommy. Damn it, Aubrey is your sister, and you will treat her with respect. You got it? John, please, just sit down. - Well do something! - Okay, relax, please, sit down. Damn you. Jesus Christ, he's out of control. John! Brian, come on. You're the therapist, fix him. Brian, honey, you can't just act out like that. Dad likes her better than me. I knew it. That's not true. Do you like her better than me? No! How could you even think like that? Look, munchkin, Aubrey is part of the family now, so you're just gonna have to learn to accept that. So can you please try, try for Mommy, just try to be nice to her? Please. Oh, baby. It's okay. Oh, it's gonna be okay. Mommy's here. Mommy's here. So, did you tell your dad you wanna quit Boy Scouts? No, well, not yet. That was your assignment last week, Tony. Why didn't you do it? He just doesn't wanna hear my feelings. You're making up your dad's mind for him. I just don't know how to tell him. You just be honest. Yeah, there's no easy way. You just tell him. Why are you drawing that stupid pig? It's for Mommy. It's just some dirty old pig. Give him back, he's not yours. What if I don't? Tony, I wanna help you, but therapy is not just you telling me your feelings, you have to go home and do the work, too, yeah? - Yeah. - You can't just keep all your feelings bottled up. I'll scream! Scream and I'll rip his arm off. Give him back now! Wait here. What's going on out here? He bit me! Oh my God. She hit me first! He really did it. Oh, sweetie, come on, let's go inside. I'll deal with you later. This was a bad idea. Maybe we should just take her back. She's a child, John. She's not some broken toaster. We adopted her and she's part of our family now. Well, what about Brian? You gonna hold his hand and explain things to him, huh? That's not fair. You coddle him, Deb. It doesn't help. Really, well would it hurt you to try a little coddling? I wonder where he gets his anger from. He got spanked, Deb, he deserved it. - What? - He deserved it. Wow, yeah, okay, wow. I'm sorry. I don't know how to handle Brian. I'm doing my best here. I know. I know, I know you are. But we can't give up on him or work so much that you're not around to deal with him. You figured that out. Yeah. Well, I think he senses it, too. You just need to try a little, John, please. He needs his dad. I'll try. I love you. I love you, too. He'll be with you in just a moment. This guy's costing me. I hope this guy's good. Yeah, he came highly recommended. How long do I have to do this for? Until you learn to act right. John. The Langston family. Hi, Dr. Keller. - I'm Debbie. - Oh, Debbie. - This is my husband John. - Nice to meet you. Pleasure. And you must be Brian. Say hello, Brian. That's quite all right, young man. It's a pleasure to meet you. Do you want us to come in... No, no, I'd like to get to know Brian on his own first. I can speak with you after the session. There's a little coffee shop downstairs. Why don't you wait there and be back in about an hour? Sounds good to me. - Great - Good. Be good for the doctor, okay, munchkin? All right, follow me, Brian. See you in a bit. Bye. You'll see, therapy's gonna be the best thing for him. - I hope you're right. - Yeah. Hi. You didn't wanna come today, did you, Brian? Your parents are worried. I want us to be friends. I wanna understand you and listen to you and hopefully help you. But, to do that, you and I have to be honest with each other. No secrets between friends. Okay? You're a good boy, Brian. Most therapists would suggest sending you away, but not me. I promise I can help you, Brian. I never break a promise. But you can't talk about anything we do in this office, or else my therapy won't work. It's very important. I'd hate to see you get sent away. Promise me. I promise. Good. Now we're getting somewhere. I'm gonna suggest that we see each other twice a week for a while. You wanna get better, right? Physical contact is a part of therapy, Brian. You're a good boy, Brian. You're a good boy. I'm supposed to tell you I'm sorry I bit you. Why do you hate me? I'm sorry no one showed up today. I don't care. Hi! Oh, hi, Gloria. - It has been forever! - Yeah. Well I've been busy, you know. I mean, stop it. - Brian is 13 already. - Mm hmm, yeah. What? Well where are all the friends? Oh, well, Brian's not really a party person, so. Let's get this picture party - started! - Oh, Gloria, no pictures. - Hey, Brian! - Just listen. - Gloria. - If I can just get - a big, happy... - Gloria, would you stop! - Why? - Stop! Whoa, Jesus! Fuck! Brian doesn't like to get his picture taken. See, Brian, Gloria didn't know, honey. I'm sorry, Brian. Brian! Are you sketching me? No, I promised I wouldn't. Can I see? You're not in it. I believe you, I just wanna see. That's pretty. Thanks. Quit it, Nathan, or I'm telling your mom! Is he bugging you? Just ignore him. I'm sorry Dad couldn't make it. I don't care. I don't believe that. Ow! I'm telling your mom! Wow, look at that, the idiot can climb. You shouldn't have done that. Why don't you go cry to your mommy? Weirdo. Stop calling me that. Or what? Let go. Weirdo vampire freak. Tell me, did you like the taste of her blood? My name is Dr. Lewis. I've been appointed, I've been appointed by the court, court, to psychologically evaluate Brian. I'm going to ask a few simple questions. Okay. Did anything upset Brian at the party? Am I being filmed? You adopted Aubrey. Why? Because you were afraid another biological child would turn out like Brian? Were you mad at your mother the day of your birthday party? Thank you, Mommy. I like that. Your wife was adopted. You don't know Debbie's birth parents. There could be a history of mental disorder. Or maybe that's crossed your mind. Excuse me? Answer the question. Has your brother ever hurt you? Do you think Brian pushed Nathan out of the tree? I'll deal with you later. I believe what my son told me. No! So you can be MOmmy's good little monster. I'll try. The truth is like a knife. It cuts through the lies. Did you wish Nathan was dead? Brian. I need you to calm down. Brian, I need you to calm down. Brian, calm down! Do you think your brother pushed Nathan out of the tree? Brian! Get an orderly in here now! We need more help in here! Now! I've determined that your son suffers from bipolar disorder with sociopathic tendencies. Your son needs close supervision. I am going to suggest to the court that he remain in my care facility. After three months, you can visit him every week. If all is going well, he'll be allowed regular visits after that. Under my care and supervision, I believe we can save Brian. My son did not kill that boy. He is not in control of his own actions. We are discussing a severe mental disorder, and much more, rage. Something goes wrong and Brian sees red. You'll be locking up an innocent child. A boy is dead and it is because of your son. I do believe he pushed that boy out of that tree. But whether he meant to kill him or not remains to be seen. He is not in control of his own actions. Mommy, it was an accident. In Brian's mind, there is no alternative to violence. He lacks basic human empathy, to differentiate between right and wrong. I believe you. I believe you. Today's the day, Brian. You are going home. I don't even know what I'm going to say to him. How about welcome home? Funny. Aubrey, we've been over this 1,000 times. Like, he literally killed someone. Hey! We don't know that. You know, it's been six years. He's changed a lot since then. And you would've known that if you'd went to visit him. Remember what I taught you, Brian. Don't take things too personally. And? To speak my feelings and to not bottle things up. And how will you conduct yourself? I'm gonna treat others the way that I wanna be treated. So you just expect me to be nice to him? Aubrey, he's already gonna feel so awkward coming in and living in this home. Would it kill you to just make him feel welcome? Okay, but what Aubrey? She didn't come and visit me. Be patient with your sister. Okay. Good. I think you're gonna do fine, Brian. Aubrey, they're here! Come on in. Hi. Brian. Hi, Brian. Honey. Aubrey, hug your brother. I'm going out. - Aubrey. - Aubrey. I'm going to my room. She didn't mean it, she just needs time. I love this drive. You must be hungry. We can get something at the food court. There's a lot of new places that you haven't tried. We can eat there. Okay, Brian, you wanna tell me what's wrong? Why didn't you make her come and see me? Honey, I suggested it, you know. But she had her fears. You let her act like that when I came home. She's doing the best she can, just like you are. Why'd you have top bring her to this family? Brian! You need to let this go. Brian, she's your sister. She's not my sister. Stop, she is, enough. She is your sister, and you two have to work things out. Please, you gotta let it go, all right? Look, just need to eat something and relax. Let's just talk about something else, okay? How about a little music? Brian? Honey, answer me. Brian, you're scaring me. Brian, talk to me! Brian, talk to me! Brian, help me. Oh, God. Brian, what are you doing? Brian, stop it! What are you doing? Brian, please stop! Brian, no! Mom. Mommy. Mom. Come on, come on, come on, Mommy, I got you. Mom. Mommy, come on, I'm right here. Wake up, please. Help! Come on, Mommy, Mommy, come on! Help, somebody! Somebody fucking help me! Come on, wake up! Come on, Mommy, come on, come on. Mommy, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Help! Losing someone so close to you can be very hard, as well as starting a new school. That's not easy. Have you had any more... Suicidal thoughts? Yeah. Have you ever attempted anything? No. I wouldn't actually do it. But even if I did, nobody would miss me. That's not true, Brian. Who would miss me? Dad? What, Aubrey? I would. No, you wouldn't, I guarantee that. - What's that? - A gift. Yeah, a way for you to take some positive steps to help you cope with everything you've been going through. A diary? A journal. A safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. Okay, I don't see how this would help me. You know, when I was your age, I had it pretty rough in school, too, and I kept a journal, and it was a wonderful place for me to express my emotions. It was my little safe space. How long do I have to do it for? As long as you want. As long as they are your true feelings. There is no right or wrong to this. Who's gonna read it? No one. Trust me, it's so therapeutic, getting whatever's stuck up here in your mind onto the page. Ah, and here's a pen. It's a little uplifting gift to inspire you to get started. "Make it a good day." - Yeah. - Really? Yeah. Because it's up to you to make every day as good as it can be. And it's up to you to keep on... Okay, what if I don't, what if I don't? I can't make you do anything, Brian. I can't force you to do a thing, but will you at least give it a try? Brian, I'm really worried about you. Okay, but there is nothing I can do to help you unless you allow me. Okay, I'll try it, for you. I'll try for you. Trust me, it'll be worth it. Hey, looking at my girl, freak? Come on, give it back, Blake. Are you serious? There you go, little bitch. What you working on? "Oh, I wish I was more like Blake "so I could get laid more often." That's what you should be writing. No, no, I'm just finishing some homework. Oh, your mom didn't finish your math for you? What you gonna do, pussy? Huh? - Huh? - Blake, leave him alone. You got lucky this time. What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't know, Aubrey, what am I doing? Can you be normal for like five seconds? I'm not even doing anything to you. You're being all super creepy stalker with my friend. No, I'm not. When are you gonna get it through your head, she doesn't like you, Brian? She never will, she's got a boyfriend, and she's out of your league, and you're acting like a gross, crazy little troll, so just stop! You're such a fucking bitch. I fucking hate you. God! Damn it. Brian! Brian! I was calling for you. Sorry, I've been practicing. I asked you to clean up around here. Okay, I'll do it. I just need to finish practicing. You know, Brian, I had a hard fucking day at work. I don't wanna hear your bullshit, come on. I just said I'll go and do it. Just give me a second. I'm going to do it, can I just please finish? You know, Brian, I get my work done and I come home, and when I come home, I don't wanna have to sit around in this filth! So go ask Aubrey to do it. You never tell her to do anything. She does plenty around here. And she's got a job, and she's saving for college. That's why I asked you to do it. I just need to finish. Just let me practice, please. I just need to practice. Ah, damn it! Get out there and clean up. Do it now! Now! Goddamn it! Stop. Stop! That'll be all. Sorry, I didn't have enough time to practice. You had as much time as everyone else. Yeah, but if I could audition at the end of the week, - that'd be perfect. - No, sorry, Brian. Today is the audition day. Pack it up. Next. Next! You have to throw it in reverse. I love you. Shit. Hey, asshole! What the fuck is this? I was just watching. - I was with some friends. - You sick fuck. I was taking some pictures over there. Of my fucking girlfriend, you sick fuck! Who the fuck else you working with, huh? What you got in here, huh? Oh, a little diary. No, stop, give that back. Come on. What are you gonna do, huh? Bitch. Stay down, you little punk. Freak. Fucking stay down or I'll wreck you. What the fuck is in here, huh? "Liz is perfect. "Liz is my everything." Oh, I can't wait to fucking show Liz this. See what a fucking creep you are. Come on, come on, you... Bro, you stay outta my fucking face. You don't put your fucking camera at my fucking girlfriend. Hey, don't ever look at my fucking girlfriend again or I'll fucking murder you, bro. You don't even fucking go to the same school as me anymore, all right, you got that? Fucking creep. Stay down, you little asshole. He has it, he has it. Brian, what's wrong, what happened? Calm down. - Brian, please- - He has it. What happened? He has, fuck! Brian! Oh my God, please, talk to me, talk to me, calm down! I can't do this anymore. I've tried to be a good person but they won't fucking let me! Who won't let you be a good person? You don't understand how fucking hard I'm trying here! You're not making any sense. You have to calm down. Brian, that's enough, please, sit down. And you, you really thought you're the one to finally fix me? I had licensed fucking therapists help me over all these years, but what fucking good did that do for me? So what did you think that you would do? You expect me to be all rainbows and sunshine and fucking unicorns. I've tried your stupid-ass notebook, but what fucking good did that do for me? You're just as fucking useless as the rest of them. You sad, pathetic, little lonely bitch! Oh my God, Brian, that's enough. You sit down! What are you doing? Mrs. Perkins called me today. Yeah, I figured she would. Look, you got a problem, you come to me. You're drunk, please. I've done nothing but provide for you, you ungrateful little prick. And I know it was you, Brian. Your mother's death was somehow your fault. Hey, asshole! Fuck you! Come here, you punk. Get you. Come here. That was all kinds of fucking stupid. You gotta be a fucking idiot. I want my notebook back. Yeah, and what do I get for it? This, I know you want it. The freak is negotiating. How fucking cute. I filled it with beer. You filled your thermos with fucking beer so you can get your stupid, little fucking diary back? Yeah. The fuck? Give me my notebook. That's in my locker, where it's staying. The fuck? The fuck did you do? What did you do, bro? Fuck, you did something. You little bitch, I'll fucking murder you. What'd you put in that shit? Fucking weirdo, come on, no, please, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, bro. Oh, no, oh, shit. Fuck, no, come on, no, come on, man. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, come on, man, come on, no, fuck, fuck! Oh, shit, fuck, fuck! Come on, man. Please, oh, God, no, fuck, no. I don't wanna fucking die. No, come on. Oh, come on. I'm fucking sorry. Come on, man, bro, please. Why the fuck can't I use my legs? Oh God, please! Please, fuck. Fuck. Oh, shit. Wait a minute, where the fuck is it? Shit. Shit, shit. Fuck, where is it? Where the fuck? You'll never get away with this. - No. - You're too lame - to pull this off. - Shut up! They're gonna put you away for the rest of your sick, perverted life. You might as well kill yourself. - No, no! - You'll be better off. - The noose is right there. - No, no, no! Fuck. Phone, where is his phone? Fuck! Hey! It was you, wasn't it? I don't know what you're talking about. Blake's missing, you hated him. What, you're delusional. Where is he, Brian? Where is he, what did you do? No, you don't understand, it was him. He's freaking crazy, he's in love with Liz, and he would've killed me, you don't understand. He's killed. He killed Nathan, he fucking pushed him out of the fucking tree. Brian, I need you in the principal's office. For what? Come with me, please. Brian, I imagine you've heard that Blake Corbin was found dead this morning. I heard he was missing. Why the hell was your notebook found in his locker? He stole it from me. Why did he steal it from you? 'Cause he's an asshole. - Brian! - My son was a good boy! No, your good boy fucked with me every day. I swear to God, Brian, - stop it! - Mr. Langston, please. Brian, we read some disturbing things in your notebook. You said nobody was gonna read that. You lied to me. Brian, where were you this morning? In class. Your father said you were out all night. So, what if I was? Tell us what happened to him, Brian. Right now! Security is going to hold you until the police arrive. I didn't do anything. - You killed my son! - I need your backpack. Brian! I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. Hey, hey, hey, Brian, slow down. Keep running, loser! Run, boy, run! Get him out of here. You should have never taken my notebook! No! What the fuck? Who are you? Answer me, come on! I am Dr. Hyland. We're going to be working together for a while. Wait, wait, wait, what the fuck are you doing? Helping you. Wait, but what the fuck is this for, what? Exposure therapy. Wait, what the fuck are you doing, though? Come on, what is this? I expose the patient to a thing that they hate. By regular contact with that thing, their issue is resolved. No, no, no, no, no, no, come on, come on. Stop, stop! No, come on, stop, please! Oh, no! Stop. Wait, what the fuck is this? A word of caution, any negative reaction will be met with far worse negative reaction. No. Please. No, no, no! No, no. Stop, stop, stop! No, no! Why, why are you doing this? 'Cause your father was right about you, and your sister is terrified. She's not my sister! Please, stop. You nervous about going home? Yeah, a little. Well, you haven't had an episode in over a year. I know, but my dad, he's still there. I don't know. You have tools. You can deal with him now. I don't know if I can. You can and you will. Believe it. I can and I will. Look, just focus on getting work and helping out, and your relationship with your dad will improve. I hope so. I know, oatmeal again. I'm gonna go food shopping tomorrow, all right? Come on. You're not even trying. You know what, you can feed yourself then. Please. - Oh. - Oh. I wasn't looking. Oh, no, you were looking, just at your phone. Yeah. Right. Right. Oh, you have tofu. Yeah, I'm vegetarian, except for when I eat fish. Oh, so you're a pescatarian. I am, too, actually. - Really? - Yeah. How long? Since I was a kid. No way. Your parents let you? My parents wouldn't let me. I had to wait until I moved out of those meat-lovers' house. It was nice meeting you. Have you been to Claudine's on Bailey Road? No. Is it good? Yeah, the best. What's your name? I'm Liz. You? Dylan. My name's Dylan. Dylan. Yeah. So do you wanna go? Sure. How about I take your number and I'll text you? Yeah, I don't have a phone right now. Really? Wow. Okay. How do we do this? Dinner tomorrow night? Have we met before? No, I don't think so. Familiar face? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, yeah. So do you wanna go? Yes. Tomorrow night, Claudine's, seven o'clock? Yeah. Okay, yeah. That's perfect. We need some cash. You don't need Mommy's ring anymore, right? Yeah. I'm sure you will not mind me pawning these, right? Thanks so much, Dad. Not happening. Another stroke? I'm sorry, but this is not the best time for me. I have plans tonight. Yeah, I have a date. Yeah, a date. Remember when you were too busy to make it to my birthday party? Remember that, Dad? Just you today? No, it's gonna be two. Oh. Sorry I'm late, Dylan. I couldn't find parking and so I found a spot in the back alley. No, no, don't worry. I actually thought you weren't gonna come. Well, I would've texted you, but. Yeah. Yeah, I really gotta get a phone. So spill it. Why no cell? You're kind of an anomaly. Well, I mean, first, I've gotta get a job. Then I can get a phone. No job, no phone. Yeah. Well were you in jail? Yeah. Oh my God, I'm sorry. I didn't know. So do I gotta worry about you chopping me up in little pieces and eating me for dinner? No, I don't eat meat, remember? Ah, right. So what were you in for? It wasn't a jail, actually, it was a hospital. I had some issues, but I'm all better now. I was just going through a dark time. Is that cool? Yeah, don't worry about it. I'm glad we're here. Me, too. So I told my dad I'm not a hooker, I just dress like one. And that did not go over very well. So you had to quit your job? Yeah, I had to. I mean, I was just in high school, and he was threatening to take away my college fund, so there goes the most fun I was having in high school. Yeah, high school suked. Yeah. Those were some of the worst years of my life. Where did you go? Chrisom High. No shit, me, too. What year did you graduate? I didn't. That was the year I was sent away. So you were in a long time. Yeah. What happened? I had this therapist, one of many, who told me to keep this notebook of my deepest secrets. And then there was this kid, this bully, he stole it from me, and it just caused... Wait a minute, wait a... Brian. Okay, Liz, I'm sorry. - Liz, I'm sorry. - I gotta go. - I can't do this. - We both want... You knew who I was and you didn't say anything? I didn't wanna scare you off. Scare me off? Brian, you are fucking crazy. Come on, Liz. For the record, everybody knew it was you who killed Blake, including me. Okay, please, don't go. Don't you touch me! He's just a little different. You're a good boy, Brian. You wanna get better, right? The truth is like a knife, Brian. Trust me. You can and will. Excuse me. She doesn't like you. Leave me alone! Liz. Leave me alone. Liz, just please let me explain, please. Explain what? - Just come on, it's not... - I swear to God, if you take one more step, I'm gonna call the cops. - Okay, Liz. - Get off of me! Shh, please, shh, shh. - Please, somebody help! - Stop! Stop. Liz. Liz. Liz. Liz. Liz, Liz. You, you sent me to all those fucking therapists and now look at me! You did this! This isn't my fault! Now you think about what you did. The entire basis of my research is that children become angry when they can't be honest, and they can't be honest if they are on the defensive. I have time for just one more question. Have you had any cases where you just failed, where all this honesty stuff just didn't work? There are no guarantees in psychology. I've definitely had a few cases where the child wasn't open and honest enough to fully grasp my treatment, but only when a mental disorder stood in their way. Ever thought that you helped someone and then it turns out that you didn't? No, never. I'm through talking with you idiots. Actually, I'm done putting on that happy face. They deserve what's coming for them. We all have to look at ourselves in the mirror and embrace the demons who stare back at us. So, Mr. Smith, you say your son is dealing with some anger issues. Oh, yes, he's very disturbed. Hey. The truth is like a knife, Dr. Lewis. It cuts through the lies! Hey! Tell me what's been happening. Well, I mean, to begin with, he bites. We've created a few of those over the years. Oh really? Oh, fuck! Help, somebody! Dr. Hyland, remember me? Well, you know, I've been told exposure therapy works wonders. Oh, and a word of caution, any negative reaction will be met with a far worse negative reaction. He bit his sister. She's newly adopted, but I guess he's just not adjusting too well. Sounds like a case I had several years ago. I'd like to meet your son. I think I could help him. Oh, I'm sure you would, Dr. Keller. How are you feeling? Stop this! How are you feeling? Are you better yet? Help, somebody! - Oh. - Are you okay? Oh, God. Tell me something. Your case years ago, did you enjoy fucking him? Jesus, Brian. Oh God! I never grew out of my biting phase. Am I not your type anymore? Fuck, fuck! Help, somebody! I was a good little boy. Dad, I'm home. Dad? Dad? The electricity went out today. When did you get home? Oh, a while ago. Where is Dad? Oh, he's in his room, of course, you know? Sorry about all the mess. You know, it's only been little me here taking care of him, and it's just been so much for me to handle. What, is there a problem? I wanna see Dad. Of course, of course you do. Come on, come on, I'll take you to him. Come on. Dad! Aubrey's here! He is gonna be so happy that you're here to see him. Oh, Daddy, Aubrey's here. Dad? Are you okay? He has had a hard time responding since the strokes. Strokes, why didn't anyone call me? Why didn't you call me? Dad? Dad? What did you do? You killed him! This is your fault! Why do you hate me? He loved you more. Brian? You need help. I know you think there's no other way out right now, but there is. Give me the knife, Brian. Do you have any idea how shit you made my life? Fuck! Fucking bitch. Brian? You are not my sister. We have a 187 and in pursuit of a 217. Copy, copy, backup is headed your way. Osiris? Come on in, sweetie, it's getting late. Osiris, where are you? Silly cat. Oh, I've definitely gotta write about this in my notebook.
