To tell you truth that I haven't really had time to think about it No,of course not -We'll have a word about it sometimes -Right -Good Bye -Good Bye,Sir -Good Bye -Good Bye Please quote us another sermon in the manual you say sticking in to it all the time I've never heard such twaddle in my life Edwina Black an example to us all, what next I like to know Dear,Lady Southdale,one must speak well of the dead Nonsense,sit down man If you can't speak the truth when they are dead,when can we I like to know? But the dead are not longer here to defend themselves Neither are they living when they say thing behind their backs But poor Mrs Black she was so Don't tell me what Edwina Black was Bless my soul,I knew her all her life And of all the dumb and hearing.. No,no,come,come People sticks,oh,I shouldn't told of the man who invented stains Mind you I used to warn her parents against spoiling her the way they did Excuse me Let me get you some more tea,Lady Southdale No thank you,my dear Just a moment my girl, I want to a word with you Shut the door Charity You should know just how charitable Edwina Black was What can I do for you,Lady Southdale? Let me have a good look at you,my dear It's a pity I didn't have a good look at you three years ago Before I recommended you for this job I wouldn't have done it Oh,why? Because you are far too good looking to be a companion What are you going to do? You can't stay here,of course I never thought of doing so All right,all right Don't ride your high horse with me There is no need,what I mean is there is no point in getting the village anything to talk about You'd better come to me Come to you,Lady Southdale? Why not? I am not as bad as I look And I certainly wouldn't treat you like Edwina did It's a wonder to me that you didn't walk out long ago Why didn't you? -Really I.. -So you don't want to come to me? I didn't say that You don't have to Perhaps you're right,I will be probably be as bad as Edwina Think it over You may change your mind And I feel a bit responsible for you It is not much of a world for a penniless young girls like you Or for lonely awkards like me either Good Bye my dear Mr Black Good Bye,Vicar -Your deepest sympathy -Thank you Here is the last of us,me as usual I want to have a talk with you sometime my boy I want to find out how it was Edwina managed to bully you with your degrees and all that and to being a village school teacher May I see you to your carriage,Lady Southdale The Vicar will do that,I haven't finished with them yet either Come along,Vicar He's gone My dear What is it? It seems wrong Wrong? All we done is to fall in love There is nothing wrong in that You should be glad Oh Gregory I didn't mean about her being dead but our being free Don't tell me you are afraid of Edwina's window It sounds like she is laughing at us Gregory I still watch she is sitting in that chair first looking at me Do you remember? Do I not And I remember too,while she was lying up there how she'd knock on the floor with her stick To call either of us But that's all over now So is that Gregory Oh no,don't What are you afraid of? I don't know Suddenly in this room In this house Something evil,she is still here Nonsense,darling Don't you believe that people leave something behind them when the die,some people No,no,of course not Let's go out into the garden Oh,yes There is nothing of her there There is nothing of her anywhere Our old coach house I don't suppose I will ever see it again What do you mean? Well,I can't stay on now What else could you do? I could go to Lady Southdale Never mind about Lady Southdale Besides I need a secretary And you promised to help me answer those letters tonight I've got a stone in my shoe You know I believed you wanted to live here I want to come to you to any place but that house I know it too much Too much what? Unhappiness Fear No happiness at all? Of course the greatest I've ever known But Poor darling,I understand I'll tell you what I will do I'll take you up to London myself tomorrow And we will get the engagement ring together And as soon as I settle things down here I'll join you and we will get married right away,shall we? How long will it take? Just a few weeks,not a moment longer that I can help You know I always wondered what a good feel to have someone on his knees to me You'd be surprised if you knew how often on my knees to you in my thoughts Do you remember the first day you came? Every minute of it I'm inside the drawing room I saw you through the window I thought you were the gardener And I thought you were the loveliest thing I'd ever seen It isn't true.Go on Isn't it any more? Never move that's exactly as you were the first I found you,asleep,remeber? It's all been my fault There is no question of fault She was your wife I should have gone away What difference would it have made? We'd still would have been in love with each other I don't know what to believe I couldn't gone on without you So if you gone away I must have followed you wherever you went Let's stop worrying and be grateful for our freedom If you don't want to stay here we can go away wherever you like Wherever I like? You know,Edwina once said something very strange to me By marrying rich I will be ending up being able to go wherever I liked to with whom I liked Well,it's true say you can Where do you wish to go? -Italy -Italy? Yes,Venice There is a city of the heart rising like water columns from the sea I've longed to go there Then you shall! I've got a little book about it Come on I'll show it to you Isn't it lovely? Terrific,looks ideal for a honeymoon Where did you get it? I sent for it a few weeks ago Then Venice to be And you forget your sniffles And I am going to stop being dishonest with myself No more pretending,no more mourning And we can leave tomorrow Tomorrow Steady,steady Good Morning,Mum And who are you? I've called to see Mr Black,Mum Didn't you see the coach? Oh yes,Mum What is it,Ellen? Are you Mr Black,Sir? Ye,but I've no time just now I'm from Scotland Yard,Sir,Inspector Martin Could I have the favour with a few words with you,Sir? You'd be better come in here Thank you,Sir You can speak quite freely in front of Miss Grahame,she is my secretary It's like this,Dr Prendergast is worried about your late wife's death certificate It seems that he regrets signing it Regret signing it? Yes,he is dissatisfied with the apparent cause of death What? He communicated his doubts to the Home Office and they as usually in such cases pass it over to Scotland Yard What do you mean such cases? What cases? In this case certain symptoms now striking him as strange Are you suggesting that my wife died from other than natural courses? Let's put it in this way,Sir The suggestion will always be there unless the matters is cleared up And how do you do that? A pathologist report will ease everybody's mind But doesn't that sound rather horrible? You mean you want to exhume the body and hold a post-mortem? That is the only way,Sir I object most strongly A question has been raised concerning Mrs Black's death,Sir, and the Law must know the answer Don't you think you owe this post-mortem to your wife in the circumstances? I've already given the necessary instructions you may depend upon it that everything will be done as discreetly as possible Where are you going far,Sir? To London I was taken Miss Grahame to London I see The cab man says if you don't come now you miss the train I shan't need it know I'll take that cab,Sir Can I offer my escort on the train to London,Miss No I don't think I want to go either A very wise decision,if I may say so,Miss I'll be down to the result of the post-mortem in a day or two Good Day Sir,Good Day Miss After you,Mum I knew it I knew it Knew what? I knew Edwina would stop us How could she stop us,Elizabeth? Elizabeth,why are you frightened? I don't know That's the awful part about it I don't know You are frightened too Of course I'm not There is nothing to be frightened of She died of a natural death Yes,but she stopped us from going away She might almost be here Laughing at us and telling us we can't escape her She is dead,Elizabeth,can't you get that in your head,she is dead Is she? Mr Black is going down to the School House,Sir He always comes back that way Of course,Miss Grahame is with him unless they are in the coach house That's there usual meeting place The coach house? Yes,I see You acted as nurse to Mrs Black didn't you? She was always Miss Edwina to me,Sir I did my best A very good nurse I expect you were too,Mum for instance you had to see that she had her medicines regularly Of course,it's no use having doctors if you don't do what they tell you That's right,Mum,and by the same token you might say no good having a policeman unless you tell him the truth Naturally,Sir Mr Black thinks they cost a lot as it is Does he now? Now we must see he gets his money's worth You want to go in there,Sir, it's a greenhouse Yes,Mum My Scotland Yard training enables me to deduce that And now ,Mum,going back to Mrs Black You're sure she had her medicines night and morning? Quite sure,Sir And you never had forgot once Never There we have a little mystery,Mum because the post-mortem reviews no trace of medicines at all She had it,Sir You're not telling me the truth,Mum You know you ought to know better than to lie to the police Now,Mum -Well,I.. -Yes? She just wouldn't take it,Sir She said it tasted horrible, she poured it away Once she ruined a bottle of toilet water I had to pour into the drain She told me not to tell the doctor or anyone Here is Mr Black With Miss Grahame Good Afternoon,Sir Nice bit of glass you have here I am a bit of gardener myself Yes,yes,you got the result? Yes,I'm afraid it is my unpleasant duty to tell you that we discovered arsenic in your wife's body You mentioned a cup of tea just now,Mum I'm very partial to cup of tea I could drink one almost any hour of the day Arsenic? That's right,Miss,arsenic You mean my wife died of poisoning? That would be the inference,Sir But if arsenic was found in her body,how did it get there? That's what I here to find out,Miss I understand that the house keeper had been with Mrs Black quite a time Yes,ever since my wife was a child Ellen was devoted to her Utterly devoted,any idea that she,that would be ridiculous What do say,Sir would their be any motive,for instance would she derive any benefit? Do you mean money? I always understood that Mrs Black would leave her an annuity but it is absurd to say I know it wouldn't be strong enough But mine would since I inherit a fortune is that what you mean? Is that what you mean,Inspector? I don't mean anything,Miss I'm just looking for facts This is the weed killer you ordered from the village They tell me at the general store that it was delivered last November Possibly I don't remember exactly I see that quite a lot has been used My wife was very particular about the gravelled paths Are you suggesting,Inspector,that the weed killer was responsible for her death? I can't say yet,Miss But this particular brand contains a high proportion of arsenic You think Mrs Black was accidentally poisoned by the weed killer? We hope accidentally,Miss Have you considered the possibility of well,I was thinking of the strain of the illness and... Suicide,Sir? How could she possibly have walked to the greenhouse? The doctor said she could not stand on her feet -No,that's true -She was far too ill Unless there were some arsenic substance in her room Perhaps we might go and have a look,Sir By all means Hear,very refreshing Could there be anything like that in her medicines? Not according to prescription,Miss Besides she asked people that she wouldn't take her medicine And I don't think you will find anything like that in her room But someone must have given it to her,Sir -Someone in this house? -Points to that ,Miss Just who? Where there any other servants? No,she dismissed them all when she took to her bed -Ellen and I had the work -And I looked after the garden Did you see your wife on the morning of her death,Sir? I looked in as usual on my way down What time would that be? About 8 o'clock I suppose At the scene? It's locked Do you always keep this door locked? No,must be Ellen I'll go and find her Whose are those rooms? That's one is mine,that's Mr Black's -Perhaps you like to see them too -Thank you,Miss Very pleasant room,Miss I keep everything in this room just as it was A very nice sentiment,Mum That is Miss Edwina's There is a stick,Mum She used it to bang on the floor To call me Indeed,Miss I take it that you were on very good terms with the deceased lady,Miss She often said what a comfort I was to her Did you wife take any stimulant,Sir? -Well -Never Yes,Sir? Well,hardly anything Not even a little wine? Sometimes,perhaps,she might had been a little indiscreet -She drank? -Oh No,no,I wouldn't say that Not since she took to her bed No,certainly not during her illness You are quite sure of that,Sir? I've already said so,I didn't expect to have to answer questions twice I must confess I'm finding this endless interrogation I don't think quite appreciate my position,Sir Perhaps I better put my point of view Your wife dies suddenly, a post-mortem is carried out which shows the body to contain a fatal dose of arsenic I'm put in charge of the investigation Now,Sir,if you were in my place, how would you set about the inquiry? What is it you want to know,Inpector? I want my questions answered truthfully Did Mrs Black take to anything to drink apart from tea and so on? A glass of warm milk every morning at eleven Who took that up to her? Ellen Not on that morning You always took it up Not on that morning Who did take it up to her that morning? She did I mean Miss Grahame I did not Are you quite sure,Miss? If she says so,of course she is I am sorry -I'm afraid I was a little.. -Yes,Miss I was a little hasty,I remember now, I did take up Mrs Black's that morning That's all right,Miss,we are all liable to overlook things You say you leave everything in here just as it was Everything It all looks nice and clean I cleaned everything in it every day Yes,I was afraid of that After you,Miss Do you remember who was in the greenhouse the last day before your wife died? I don't know I was in and out every day How about you,Miss? Where you in that day? Probably,yes I'm sure I was there I used to ward of the plants in the evening In the evening? Now,I want you think hard did you notice if the weed killer was on its usual place on the shelf? No I didn't,why should I? It's important can't you make an effort? No doubt that if Miss Grahame had known it was so important she would have examined the entire greenhouse Don't darling Our report says that your wife died the following morning about 12 o'clock wasn't it? Yes,I suppose it was I didn't notice particularly I don't think I need bothering you anymore today Pertinent things these little travel brochures my good lady got us one of Switzerland that's the year we went to Southend, do you think of going abroad,Sir? Yes Were you going alone? What do you mean,was I going alone? According to the rubber stamped date on this it was sent here five weeks before the lady's death I don't mind telling you that puzzle me a bit,Sir Were you going alone? Why? Five weeks in advance of the lady's death,seems a little pessimistic I ordered it quite often for going abroad But you didn't order it,Sir, you sent for it,didn't you,Miss? Yes,I did Then why ask me,Inspector Why hide the fact you knew Miss Grahame sent for it? I made the assumption that she sent for it on your instructions,Sir Secretary of duty Inspector,Mr Black didn't ask me to send for it,I did it on my own initiative Then you were wise because it so far in advance Very wise indeed as it happened -Look here Inspector -Gregory I've no doubt it could be explained,Sir Like a lot of other things in this case Such as you would have wanted to kill your wife I shall be staying the night in the village I shall be back early in the morning Give it time to think it over That you discover something that I've have overlooked Good Night Sir,Good Night,Miss Miss Grahame -Yes -Supper is ready if you are I'll wait for Mr Black Is he going to be long? No,he is only going to the village to get some tobacco I wanted to ask what you and Mr Black are going to do about this house? If you are thinking about your own plans wouldn't be better to consult Mr Black I would have thought you knew all about it Really? Why should you think Did you put that back there? I did I was told to put it back Who told you? Miss Edwina What do you mean? She told me to put it back two years ago And her wish is still law in this house as long as I live Well if you take my advice I do not take advice from people like you How dare you talk to me like that It's a pity somebody didn't talk to you like that long ago before you made Edwina suffer as you did Do you think she didn't know what was going on down here You are a wicked woman Do you think it wasn't plain for everybody to see what was between you and Mr Black Truth will out as you would know before you are much older You couldn't see me I wasn't a poor helpless invalid tied to one go No,you could go and tell your lies to anyone who listened to you I only said I knew what you said,I just seen the doctor I know who he had to thank for this,you scandalmonger And what about yourselves,she fed and clothed and housed you and took it all Hold your tongue You can't summons me,I'm not afraid of topper of porters Living on her charity,carrying on down there while she.. Get out,get out you hear I am going I don't want to stay in house where murder has been committed No,no darling please It's all right I am not going to cry It's -It's just -Yes,I know Let's forget the whole wretched business,shall we? After all what does it matter what Ellen says We'll get rid of this place As soon as this is over And then everything would always blend We'll go to London,get married Then Venice Murder indeed Darling don't take notice what she said,how can it have been murder If it were,either you or I did it,since neither of us did it,couldn't have been I light the lamp No,don't let's have the candles Good idea And the silver and the glass and the lace and all the things we never saw used Happy You know I've never seen it like this before I can't understand people have lovely things not using them Doesn't that petunia look nice in the candle light? Yes,I'm rather proud of that When did you bring it in? The morning Edwina died I thought of taking it up to her room You know I think we ought to complete the picture and dress Well I have got one evening dress That's all you need I don't know what it is like I haven't looked at it since I came here I'll buy you dozen in Paris One of the things we will have in our new house will be plenty of light not a dismal old barn like this I wonder if Ellen is going yet I'll go and see Ellen No she must have gone I expect she's gone to visit that old crony of hers at the vicarage That's fine we'll got the house for ourselves,what will be better? You look beautiful What are you hiding? Come to that what are you hiding? Little job for you,darling, that's as far as I could get Oh,I will not bite you You like them They look wonderful But they aren't? No,no,they were my mother's Now then Now let's look at you Why did stop the doctor for coming to see Edwina the day before she died? I didn't She said she didn't want him Darling what is it? What's the matter? I was just,you know I don't care what anyone in the world thinks about us But I do care terribly what we think It's Edwina Darling we mustn't let her come between us You'll be in Italy soon,miles away What are we got to worry about,we are lucky To each other I wonder Are you regretting? No,I regret nothing Whatever happens I'm glad we met What made you send for that travel booklet? Five weeks ago Because Edwina was always telling me about Italy And how you taken her on honeymoon and how happy she had been Gregory I couldn't bear it, I wanted to be in Italy with you So I sent for the booklet and every night I had a look at it and go there with you In my dreams What are you thinking about? Are you sure there were no other reasons? What do you mean? I mean what I say You are speaking to me as you were the inspector I've been silly You even looked at me as he did,as if I were lying -Nonsense -Yes,lying I only meant it must have seen odd by the inspector Are you sure you don't mean it that you found it odd Even if I did I still love you I love you as much as you must have loved me to make you Make me what? I see I didn't kill Edwina if that's what you mean I've must have been crazy If you love me any less because I didn't No,please darling forgive me I don't know what made me Edwina you said that you brought them the morning she died,didn't you? And you were last in the greenhouse and not I But darling what does it matter, why do you keep on about these things I wish I've never seen you or brought you into the house I'm going out Is this what we put our evening dress for You see my love,we mustn't keep on about these things You can take anyone of them turn it around and make it look suspicious Yes,yes,and that's just what she wants us to do It is We mustn't let her She is dead ,Elizabeth Let her stay dead That was the door of Edwina's room No,it couldn't have been It was,I'm sure of it How could it have been? I'll go up and see,shall I? Don't.Don't go up No,I think Ellen must have left the box room door open Why are you trembling? My nerves have been on edge ever since the inspector came It is silly to let him upset you He is just an ordinary man He has probably got an ordinary wife too I think it is because he is so ordinary that he frightens me I can feel the full weight of the Law behind him That's ridiculous is not as you had anything to conceal Let's go and light the candles Matches? There are some in the drawing room I'll get them Gregory Gregory Gregory What is it? -She is here -Where is she Where are the matches? I dropped them Here,silly You know how it is I can smell her perfume She is alive Elizabeth,keep control over yourself Perfume Why? It is this altar cloth she has been working on That's were it came from Heavens How I know, for a moment I really thought Yes,so did I,just shows you how easy it is to Darling don't ever lose control over yourself again like that I had enough of that from Edwina and at last -At last what? -Oh,nothing,let's forget it First the doctor,then the booklet then the petunias I wish to heaven that I hadn't forgotten to take them up with me Then you did go up What does it matter? After I took up the milk up at eleven Suppose I did Why didn't you tell the inspector? Because he didn't ask me Anyway I didn't think it important But he did ask you and you said that you saw her eight o'clock on your way down So I did look in at eight o'clock What happened the second time when you saw her Nothing Nothing Do you expect me to believe that? Yes,I do For the very good reason she was already dead Dead? I thought so,she seemed to be What time was this? I don't know about half past eleven something like that But I saw you out in the garden just before twelve What's that got to do with it You've just come from her room and she was dead you just go into the garden What did you expect me to do? I had a shock and I wanted time to think You were the last with Edwina, last in the greenhouse I see What do you mean with see? You are trying not to tell me that you killed Edwina For both our sakes I know What? I understand so well why you did it Oh Gregory I wish you hadn't Elizabeth Whatever can I say or do to make you believe me Here is Edwina's bible If I swear on this bible that I didn't kill my wife,will you believe me? I swear to you on this bible I did not kill my wife I thought you'd gone How could I go at this time of the night I came down to fetch my lamp What were you doing in my wife's room? I was sitting there,thinking Taking my leave of her All that time I didn't know the time The clock there hasn't gone since I stopped it the morning Miss Edwina died at 12 o'clock Why did you lie to me? Why did I what? Gregory,I must know the truth What are you talking about You said she was dead at half past eleven Ellen says she died at twelve Don't you see,Gregory,I've got to know Why have you got to know Anymore than I got to know Do I keep on at you about what happened when you took up milk that morning Or what you did in the greenhouse in the night before what exactly was in your mind when you sent for that booklet I told you all about that And I told you But you lied to me How do I know you were not lying to me? Gregory,if you won't tell me what happened,will you tell the inspector Elizabeth my darling what are we doing to each other We are destroying each other We've noon else in the world to turn to Look what we're doing It isn't us It's this house it's full of,everything that comes between us,if only we could stop that We could if we really loved each other We need each other now,Elizabeth Not in some next time but now For you,darling What a lovely thought So it should be,happy? Never been happier in my life The bible -This isn't the bible at all -What? This book It isn't the bible It's a dictionary What about it,darling? You swore on it It isn't the bible I thought it was,looked like it, it's about same size Just a mistake Don't you believe me? Elizabeth,don't you believe me I can't,you've Ben lying to me all the time You liar Elizabeth,what are you saying You liar It was an accident,Good Heavens Another lie,nothing but accidents and lies Like that inscription on your wreath In memory of my beloved and devoted wife was that an accident too? Elizabeth,was has come over you? I had enough of your accidents, there are too many of them Are you mad talking to me like this? Do you want to ruin everything between us,you can't do that,not now Not now Was that why you made love to me last night? To stop me from saying what I think? Was that the idea? To make me shut up? No it wasn't,but shut up,you hear, shut up,you are mad I can't bear your suspicion of me longer You're making everything cheap How dare you say that to me While only a few hours ago I looked at you as you were a God and all time you were nothing but a liar and a cheat Elizabeth,I beg you,listen to me I've listened to you enough as it is Edwina was right and she warned me to be on my guard against you When I think what you have done to her and now you are trying to put the blame on me you coward,why don't you admit that you killed her Very clever,most impressive but I see now what you are up to Another twist? Why didn't I see it before? Think you could fool me like that Smile at me and all of our scheme and plan to make me pay for your crime There are worse crimes than murder I've been poisoned too poisoned by your lies and your lovemaking that meant nothing at all You saw that I was starved for little affection so you came into my arms that was your chance to escape from poverty I should have known that a man who lived on his wife's money was capable of anything I did not live on my wife's money I had my salary Schoolmaster salary 125 £ year with that favour all this and your fine clothes You throw that in my face just like she used to You are another Edwina,you even look like her,sitting there in her chair You poisoned her because you wanted luxury If you are so sure I killed Edwina why don't you go and tell the Inspector I'll tell him too,what happened in that room at eleven thirty You daredevil,you coward You didn't think that when you made love to me the way you did I never made love to you, you made love to me You didn't exactly make it difficult for me did you? So Edwina has won after all Very well then,I'll tell you what happened up there When I went into her room she appeared to be delirious But when I could make sense out of what she was saying She said you slipped something into her milk that morning and she knew she was poisoned But Gregory you didn't believe her I told her I didn't believe it but she said I would be next on your list Then after raving for a bit she fell back lifeless You know I never really believed that poison look story Gregory,I didn't believe the things I said either You are right I was mad -I will be dead -Don't say that I am doomed,I've lost you No my darling we wouldn't.. How could you What's to become of you without you How can you after the things I have said I said things too Why you are shivering Let me get you some wine I'm afraid you are going to faint I am all right You have one too All right a good idea Let's drink a toast No more suspicions,no more doubts To the future To the future What are we drinking Ellen,Ellen I've been poisoned -Good Morning,Mum -Good Morning Inspector I'm very glad to see you Indeed,Mum,I'm glad to hear it,doesn't often happen in my line of business I expect you come to see Mr Black -That's right,Mum -He is gone Gone away? He went to fetch the doctor Indeed Obviously not to see you with that happy smile on your face you are off Miss Grahame She is been poisoned -She is dead -No,no she is not dead I heard screams and there she was calling out at he had poisoned her Who had? Mr Black Where was he? He was there too Together we carried her up to her room I see -Then he went to the doctor -Yes And he hasn't come back He came back but the doctor wasn't there He went to Gaten over an hour ago Did she tell how she got this poison? In that wine I didn't clear that away I shall be able to go now It's a mercy for her that I was here If he had his way I'd left last night Yes I would like to have a few words with Miss Grahame She's been very ill,Sir I think she will be able to see me I will come and tell you when she is ready I've been trying to get a doctor he is still not in I suppose you heard about Miss Grahame Yes I hear that you tried to poison her That was she says -You mean the port was all right -Yes I had a glass of myself -Did you have two glasses? -No Is this your glass? No Yes Look inspector I'll try to explain this Excuse me Sir,perhaps you'd better explain in front of Miss Grahame Miss Grahame is ready to see you now,Inspector After you,Sir Good Morning Miss I am sorry to hear you've been ill -Now Sir -He tried to poison me Why would he want to do that Miss? To stop you from finding out that he killed his wife He wanted you to think I've done it and then committed suicide because I was afraid of being charged with the murder And she was afraid,becuse she did poison my wife And then she poisoned herself as well? No,I think she must have slipped something in her glass to make it look like it When my back was turned Why do you think she poisoned your wife? Marry me,of course,and get away from all the poverty she's always lived in And I suppose you say,Miss,that Mr Black killed his wife to inherit the money Isn't it obvious No,Miss I'm afraid it isn't you see I visited the late Mrs Black solicitor this morning and he told me some very interesting facts for instance that you, Miss, inherit half the money I -Yes,did she never tell you? -Never That's not true She told me herself Edwina said she would be rich one day -I never dreamed -Did she say that,Miss? I thought that it was one of her cruel jokes I thought Miss Edwina said it very nicely I was there at the time Did Mrs Black tell you,Mum that your expectation would be considerable and not small as you originally understood Didn't bother to me whether it was big or small,I loved Miss Edwina Is that why you gave her port? Gave her port? It was against the doctor's order Pouring away her medicine was also against the doctor's order but you let her do that Now if the late Mrs Black didn't drink port who did -You Miss? -I drank a glass this morning For the first time since I came to this house How about you,Sir? Hardly ever -I am a teetotaller -Very admirable thing too,Mum But I see half a dozen empty bottles on the refuse side in the garden And the wine merchant in the village Tells a very considerable quantities were delivered to your orders during the last six months Now if the late Mrs Black didn't drink who does drink all port in this house You can go to prison for telling lies to the police,Mum I wouldn't have given it to her,Sir But she used to crave for it,it brought the colour back to her cheeks But he knew all about it You told me your wife didn't take any stimulants during her illness here I said hardly any Besides I didn't want anyone to know What that she was a heavy drinker or that you allowed her to drink She kept on me day after day Now,Mum,that bottle downstairs that came from Mrs Black's room didn't it? I want the truth Yes I got it down the morning she died -What is all this got to do -All in good time,Miss Now I find myself at a loss All three of you stand to inherit money All three of you had access to arsenic and to the dead lady's room I'm afraid I must ask all of you to accompany me to London You mean you are arresting us? Or rather say that you've been invited to answer further questioning How can I go? I've been poisoned I don't think you were poisoned,Miss What you had was an overdose of that rather unpleasant medicine that was poured away This time into an half emptied port bottle Now,there is a plenty of time before the next train to London But if you wouldn't mind preparing yourselves for the journey and meanwhile,Sir, with your permission I'll take a stroll in the garden How Edwina must be enjoying all this What next I should like to know In hope you pardon me a bit,Mum I thought a cup of tea would sustain us on our journey In the kitchen? I think Mr Black will wave conventions for once,we can all have it together You got the wrong cups Have I? Never mind,Mum I don't hold with those little cups they have nowadays Sit down,Mum,make yourself at home Miss Grahame Come in? We are just going to have a cup of tea The kettle is nearly boiling won't be a minute Take a seat If you don't mind my saying so,Miss You have very pretty hands, things I notice,hands You remember last April,Miss? You bought a preparation for your hands from the chemist in the village Something to whiten the skin Perhaps you can describe it? Was it last April? It was a powder,white powder to be dissolved in water That was the second lot of that powder you bought wasn't it? Yes,first one turned colour I had to get some more Seems to be enjoying yourself,Inspector Just making a cup of tea for the journey I thought it was hardly the moment There are few moments in life when a cup of tea is not welcomed,Sir Now,Sir,I believed it was you who fetched that second lot of hand powder for Miss Grahame Hand powder? I don't know,don't remember Sir,you have a habit of not remembering I remember,Ellen was in bed with a cold and Mr Black,said he would bring it on his way home from school I fetch it,what about it? We are coming to that,Sir One,two,three,four and one for the pot Always pot to kettle,never kettle to pot Miss Grahame,did you use all that powder on your hands? Not all of it What became of the remainder? I had it in my room in a In a what,Miss? In a bowl,a silver bowl Mr Black told me that the chemist said it must be kept from the air or it would discolour like the first lot Where is that bowl now,Miss? I don't know it was in my room but I couldn't find it some days ago, I suppose I must have mislaid it Mislaid,Miss,that is a pity,a great pity I suppose we all take milk and sugar It was the remainder of that powder that killed Mrs Black Your tea,Miss -Mum -So it wasn't the weed killer? No,we analysed the weed killer nearly half of it was sand Wouldn't dissolve in anything And there was not a trace of sand find at the post-mortem,only pure arsenic And that powder you used for your hands,Miss,was pure arsenic Didn't you knew that? How should I know it? Because it is matter of pretty common knowledge arsenic discolours when it is exposed to the air If I had known that I would have kept it locked away I'd thought that you would have known that,Sir,a man with your education I suppose I did vaguely I hadn't thought about it Is it the only chemical that reacts to air like that? You sure the chemist never mentioned the nature of that powder? Not that I remember He never mentioned it to me They have to be a bit careless in this country districts the poison law needs tightening up You must not let your tea get cold Miss Mine is not quite sweet enough How about yours,Miss? Yours Mum? I take two spoonfuls I only put one -That's it -The sugar bowl That's not the sugar bowl -Where did you find it? -In the kitchen You didn't find it in the kitchen Where else should I find it Mum? Did you put some into my tea? Put some more in your tea?Sugar? That's not sugar What is it,Mum? The arsenic? I was hers How did you know I didn't find this in the kitchen? -They told me -Where to hide it? Yes,that's right They told you hide this in the coach house -Preposterous -One moment,Sir You have poisoned me you have given me this stuff I want it out I haven't poisoned you,Mum, I took good care of that This is the arsenic that was in the bowl What's in there now is sugar They did it,they wanted to get rid of Miss Edwina When did they tell you to hide this? The day after Miss Edwina died You mean to say that you hid this for them in the coach house? Knowing it was arsenic in it? Do you expect me to believe that? He killed her,he wanted to kill her, he knew her heart was weak He came up that morning and shouted at her,frigtening her That's a lie If you please ,Sir And so your mistress died of a heart attack Yes,that was what she died of And that is exactly what the doctor said Until you went and him and mention poison Now,Mum,I suggest that you stole this from Miss Grahame's room and gave your Mistress arsenic a few seconds before you knew she was going to die.Why? I want the truth It was Miss Edwina she made me do it Oh what I said? Go on,Mum,tell us the rest of it She knew she was going to die Again and again she made me promise that I wouldn't let her die Before she had the poison I don't understand this I thought she was dead when I left the room at eleven thirty before Ellen went in No,Sir,so you were mistaken, she couldn't have been She was dying She pleaded with her eyes And you helped her to take the poison And the plan was to incriminate Mr Black and Miss Grahame Miss Grahame was made to take the milk cup that morning and Mr Black was made to keep the doctor away the day before And this bowl was to be hidden in a place you knew they usually met She made me promise And you deliberately accused them of murder only a minute ago They hurt her cruelly,and I was going to see they suffered in their turn they ought to suffer,a sheep, up in that room alone unable to move,knowing that they were down there waiting for her to die I picked me to tell you and everybody will know about her I don't care what you do to me, you can send me to prison But nobody must know that Miss Edwina committed such a sin Her memory must always be respected -You mustn't tell,you mustn't tell -Now,Mum,calm yourself You and I are going to have a little talk,shall we? Come along But nobody must know,you must not tell We'll talk it over,shall we ,Mum,you leave it all to me If I may say so,Miss,Sir, we human beings are very open to suggestions In the dark,coat hanging on a door,becomes a monster,a tree becomes a devil himself This house has been a dark place for the last few days So a travel-booklet grows into a menace, a medicine becomes a deadly poison That's exactly what Edwina wanted You would think she would have succeeded as far as she did unless Unless what? The ground has to be fertile before you can plant a seed You'll be hearing from me very shortly,Sir Good Day to your both Going Elizabeth? Have we nothing to say to each other? What is there left to say Bitterness will last a lifetime Isn't our hope that all the bitterness has already been said between us? Is that all or love amounted to but we failed the first test That was happened,isn't it? Only if we say so You are right Edwina Now you can rest in peace Elizabeth Subtitles by Seglora
