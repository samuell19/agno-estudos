(PLANE ENGINES WHOOSHING) ANNOUNCER: Flight 69 from New York meet at the LaGuardia terminal, now arriving gate 5A, concourse A. Hi, little sister. Good to see you. Yeah, it's really good to see you. The best surprise so far this year. Yeah, I heard about you and Carol splitting. It's really a surprise. Yeah, it's probably for the best though. She dating Dan now. You know what I mean. Why don't you come back and go to Newcomb? (LAUGHS) Oh, it's a better school, besides you don't make it as a Vassar girl. You know, darling, my dear Vassar isn't exactly the dream school. Just far enough away from our big brother. Look, by the way, where is he? Look, I told you I had to see you both. I made that clear on the phone, Vance. Yeah, what's wrong, Denise? It's nothing, but look, I've got something to tell you both and I have to go back to school tonight. Look, is he here? No, he's home playing big brother as usual. I tell you, he's really pissed that you won't talk about this on the phone. Look, Vance, you don't talk about this on the phone. Yeah, but you know how he blew his top when you decided to go to Vassar. He's afraid some Yankee carpetbagger's gonna seduce you on one of your weekends in New York. Okay if a southern bigot at LSU in Baton Rouge seduces me? You're in rare form, honey. Look, Vance, please don't let him... Oh, Christ, this is such a bummer. Denise, what is it? I have something to tell you both and please, Vance, when I tell you don't cop out on me. You're the only family I've got. All right, let's have it. Well? I'm getting married. Of course, Denise, what else does a young lady of culture and breeding do when she finishes school? But that's hardly any reason to fly down here and get me out of court. Oh, don't use your courtroom technique on me, Dan. Know what I mean? I'm getting married now and I'm not going to finish school. I can't finish school. Just what do you mean you can't finish school? After all the money I've spent on that damn Yankee institution, I think you'd better clarify that last statement! Hey, hey, hold it! Take it easy. Honey, why can't you finish school? You can tell us. You've got to tell us. I can't finish school because I'm getting married next week in New York. And I'm pregnant. Oh, Jesus. Well, I'll be a son of a bitch. I would have bet my last dime that a Robert woman could handle her first school romance without this. This isn't a school romance, Dan. My pregnancy isn't an accident. Oh, spare us the details, Denise. Look, I'll arrange an immediate abortion and you'll return to school. Abortion? For Christ sakes, Dan! There is one thing, however. This boy, I want to talk to him and his parents. And I hope to God, Denise, he comes from a decent family. Just stop! Oh, D. Please sit down, Vance. I haven't told you everything. Vance, I love you very much. I know how you feel about things, Dan. I mean, about life in general. Don't know how to tell you the rest. Good Lord, Denise, I've had enough. Will you out with it? All right, Dan! The man. A black man. What? A black man. You. My baby sister. You let a stinking degenerate nigger into your body? (SLAPS) Hey, Dan! You'll kill her! She's better off dead. No nigger son of a bitch is gonna marry my sister! (SLAPS) Damn it, Dan! (PUNCH LANDING) You're a real shit, you know that, Dan? I knew it. You knew about this all along, didn't you? Well, you listen to me, little brother. She doesn't exist. As far as I'm concerned, I don't have a sister! You, as for you, you little slut. You go back to that nigger and I'll kill him, do you hear me? I'll kill him! Let go of her, Dan! I'll kill the both of 'em! He's a dead nigger, I promise you, he's as good as dead! You are nuts, Dan! You belong in a goddamn cage! Carol doesn't think so now does she, little brother? Your former girlfriend is going to marry me. She couldn't take any more of your nigger-loving ways. VANCE: Denise! Honey, where you going? I don't wanna talk about it, Vance. I love him. I'm going back to New York where he is. Oh, Denise, it can't work. Think about it! You know, these things they just don't work! Never thought I'd hear that from you, Vance. Oh, D, if it was just you and me and this crummy world didn't exist, it could work, you know I believe that. What are you gonna do? I don't know what I'm gonna do. But I'll do something. Whatever it is, I'll do it with him. Oh, D! Oh, gee! He scares me. I know what Dan is capable of. I'm not gonna run, baby. But you don't understand, he's capable of murder. You can't run, Denise. You just can't. I had to tell you. I couldn't keep it in any longer. It'll be all right, baby. I'll tell Jake and everything will be fine. Oh, God, I love you. I love you so much. (GUN FIRES) (BOTH SCREAMING) (CRYING SOFTLY) (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) (WATER RUNNING) (BELLS TOLLING) Well, what do I say, Father? Amen might be appropriate. Yes, it might at that. You know, Jessie, the church could stand a bit more humility itself at times. Practicing what one preaches is sometimes a very difficult thing to do. But you came back and that's what's important. You know, it's a whole lot like the parable of the prodigal son. You see, that story, Jessie, is not just about the son that returned to the fold. No, there was another son. He stayed, and ended up hating his father, his brother, his very home itself. Now the church is your home, and you came back. And if we couldn't accept your humanity, well, the church would be the loser. This way we both win. You have the church, but most important the church has you. Yes. Well, I want to thank you for helping me get my old parish back in New Orleans. Father Babbin figures returning to the scene of the crime is standard procedure in criminology. Maybe in theology it has its place also. (CHUCKLING) God bless you, my son. Thank you very much, Father. And goodbye. Goodbye. Jessie! Father Jessie! Ann. Oh, it's great to have you back. Why didn't you telephone, tell us you were coming? We didn't expect you for another three days. I didn't want to inconvenience anybody. Let me look at you. So how you been? Fine. You look great. Thank you. Welcome home. Thank you. Well, the place sure hasn't changed much, has it? Well, I like that. All our brilliant carpentry and you didn't even notice. Notice what? The wall, Father. We finally got our new window in. (LAUGHS) Oh, that! Yeah, well, it looks good. Well, look, Father, I have to run. Let's get together for lunch, okay? Fine. I have to teach my biology class about reptiles. I'll see you later. In the cafeteria. Yes. Bye-bye. (CHOIR SINGING INDISTINCTLY) For your penance, say an Our Father and a Hail Mary. By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, I absolve you from your sins in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, amen. God bless you and go in peace. Father York, can I see you for a moment, please? Sure, Jim. What is it? Jessie, I'm going to take over your duties here at the rectory for several days. Why, Father? Have I done something wrong? No, that's just the point, your work here has been superb. It's just that you're spending all of your time here and that isn't good. Now why don't you take it easy? Renew acquaintances. And there is one very touchy situation in which you could be extremely helpful. The Roberts. Oh, you mean between Dan and Vance. Mmm, have you seen them yet? No, Father, I've been... Then you don't know about Denise. Denise, what about Denise? About her suicide. Her what? Yes, she committed suicide. You were away at the time and then you went into the monastery incommunicado. My God. Well, why, what happened? I don't think anybody knows the whole story, but it split Dan and Vance. Jessie, why don't you go and see them? I think you could make a lot more headway with them than I can. And take all the time you need, don't worry about the rectory, I'll cover your duties here. Thank you, Father. Yes, of course, I'll do that. (JIVE MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Father Babbin told you? What? Oh, Ann. Come in. Sit down. (RADIO SWITCHES OFF) About Denise's suicide. Oh, yes, that. Yes, he did. Who's that young man? Some guy she was going with at the time, I think, I'm not sure. Did Father Babbin tell you about the rumor? Rumor, what rumor? She was pregnant and the father was black. Oh. No, he didn't. Nobody wants to talk about it. Vance won't talk about it, even with me. Even to you? Oh, I'm sorry, you couldn't know. Vance and I are going together now. Well, how long has that been going on? Ever since Carol... Yes, yes. It's gettin' pretty bad. Vance is still hung up on losing Carol and sometimes I think Dan's marrying her just to spite Vance. That's my problem, I talk too much anyway. I've got to get through to Vance, for our sake. I just don't want to see you get hurt. Not with all that's coming down with the wedding and all. Yeah, I know what you mean. How's Vance taking it? Oh, he doesn't love Carol, he never did. It's just his male ego, his pride that's hurt. Dan tends to rub things in. Yeah. Father, I've got to run. Vance is picking me up, I'm late already. Bye, Father, thanks. Hey. You play it cool, okay? Where is he? Where is that little punk? I may be your law partner and your best man, but I'm not your brother's keeper. (ORGAN MUSIC) Dan, we're ready when you are. Thank you, Father. (TIRES SCREECH) Oh... I'm sorry I'm late. All right, little brother, get your coat on. We've been waiting 20 minutes on you. We've been waiting 20 minutes on you. What did you say? You're drunk. You're right! I am drunk. For once... Vance, shape up! Think you're gonna mess up Carol's wedding, you're crazy. Carol's wedding? Oh, Carol's wedding. No, sir. No, I wouldn't mess up Carol's wedding. Hey, not... Me do that? No. I mean, after all, she almost married me. You little bastard. If that rationalization suits your adolescent ego, you go right ahead. I think the lady decided she wanted a better man. (HITTING) (SHOUTING) Ow! Ooh! Dan, stop! Dan! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) You damn black nigger. That's right, Dan. I may be a nigger, but this is the Lord's house and no man, black or white, is gonna defame it. (LAUGHING) Come on, Vance, let's go. Hey, it's a beautiful wedding, huh? Come on. Beauty and the bigot. Keep the family name untarnished, Dan. Blue blood to blue blood. Keeping the names pure! (ORGAN MUSIC) I bet you never saw a wedding like that, huh, Jessie? You're right, that's a new one for me, all right. Hey, I gotta go back! What you gotta go back for? I forgot to kiss the bride, Jessie. Don't worry about it, neither did I. Come on. Jessie! That's it! We both gotta go back and kiss the bride and then when you kiss her Dan is gonna have a heart attack and then I'll move in on Carol. (CHUCKLING) Come on, let's talk about it in the car, okay? Hey, I'm driving. And I'm buying the coffee, okay? VANCE: Who's gonna pay for it? What? You see, Carol was raised believing that being born into the Daughters of the Confederacy was second only to salvation, you know? But she started coming around when I was going with her. Then I went to 'Nam and my brother moved in and his money and his social... Listen, have you ever considered that losing Carol might be the best thing? For you, I mean. I mean, if it's what she wants. We know it's what Dan wants. Frankly, I think they deserve each other, man, and you're better off out of it. I'll be all right. As soon as my ego heals. At least that's what Ann tells me. Dan Robert's got a big one coming, Jessie. That's a promise. You know I never told anybody this before, but Denise, she'd be alive today if that racist bastard, if he had thought about her instead of his social image. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I heard about Denise. Vance. Is there any truth to the rumor that she was pregnant and that the father was black? Oh, it's not a rumor, Jessie, he was black all right. That's why she's dead! She couldn't take Dan's bigotry. Then he, he completely disowned her, he beat her up, he threatened to kill her! Threatened to kill both of them! He killed her. He might as well have cut her wrists himself and damn it, Jessie, that man's gonna pay for it. Well, well, Miss Carol. You sure make a pretty bride. Thank you, Willie. And marrying Mr. Dan too. And all the while I thought Mr. Vance was the one. (DOOR SLAMS) That's enough, Willie. Dan, it's all right. It's all right. Carol, honey, would you wait for me on the porch? I'll be right there. Willie, I thought I told you to stay out of the way. I'm sorry, Mr. Dan, just trying to... I don't care what you were just trying to do, Willie. I'm tired of you stumblebumming around here day after day, year after year. I want you out of here, you're dismissed. Dismissed? You mean fired? But, Mr. Dan, I can't find another job just like that. I've been working for you and your daddy so long, I haven't even had time to think about working anywhere else. That's not a subject I wish to discuss, Willie. My father's dead and I'm in charge now. You've got your notice, you're dismissed. Mr. Dan, what about Clara May? I mean, you know how long she been sick. All that medicine, all that debt I'm in. I can't afford to miss one payday, let alone look for another job. You heard me, Willie. You have your notice. I want you and all of your tools out of my garage by tomorrow. I understand you handled these in 'Nam, right? You don't know the time I had keeping that little devil alive. Well, have fun. (WHISTLING) Hi, Father Jessie. Oh, hello, Vance. Yeah. Well, how are you doing today? Fine. Well, better anyway. Dan still won't talk to me. Can't really blame him, I guess I did kind of screw up the wedding, eh? Oh, you have to give him a little time. That's why I'm here. I thought I'd send him over some flowers to help smooth things out. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh he's gonna love that. A token Negro priest asking for his forgiveness. Massa Dan, sure sorry I stopped ya from defamin' the church and killing your younger brother. (CHUCKLING) He'll really love that. Come on, Vance, now don't be so bitter. That attitude'll kill you in the long run. After all, to ask forgiveness is humility. But to forgive, salvation. You really ought to give Dan a chance. Oh, Jessie, how can you say that? I mean, after all the crap you've had to put up with from people like him? People like him. Let me tell you something. I get it from both sides. For some whites, I'm a good nigger. The only difference between a good nigger and a nigger is the word good. And for some blacks, I'm an Uncle Tom nigger. Believe me, it's all the same thing. Nigger's an ugly word but it is, after all, only a word. You're too much, Jessie. Vance. Those roses are exactly what I want. How much are they? (LAUGHING) Oh, nothing, on the house. Come on now. Welfare case I'm not, how much? Okay, 18.50 a dozen. I'll bill you later. (LAUGHING) Will they get there today? Oh, yeah, if I have to deliver 'em myself. Well, Vance, I really have to go. Good to see you, yeah. Glad you came by. So am I. Hiya, Willie, how you doing? Got some more flowers for you. You got enough flowers here to make a funeral. Who these from? I don't know. Well, go on, I'll take it over now. (LIGHT MUSIC) (KNOCKING) Come on in, Willie. Some more flowers, Miss Carol. Thank you, aren't these lovely. And, Miss Carol, tell Mr. Dan I'll be leaving tomorrow like he said. Oh, yes, Willie, I am sorry. I'll tell him. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? JESSIE: (ON PHONE) This is Father Jessie. Why, yes, Father Jessie, this is Carol. Carol, I'm sorry about yesterday. Well, I am too, Father. Is Dan home? Yes, he's in his study. I'd like to come over and apologize in person. Oh, I wish you would come over. Oh, by the way, Father, your flowers arrived and they're breathtaking. Thanks so much. You're welcome. Is dinnertime okay? Fine. About 7:00 then? That's good. Good, we'll be waiting for you. Goodbye. (KNOCKING) Come in, Father, so good to see you. Good evening, Mrs. Robert. You have a seat and I'll get Dan. Thank you. Oh, I hope I'm not disturbing him. Not at all, I'll get Dan and be right back. DAN: Good evening, Father. Come on up. Well, Dan, hello. And how is the new husband? As well as can be expected under the circumstances. What can I do for you? Well, I actually came over to talk to you... Come over and have a seat. Thank you, Dan. Would you like a drink? No, I don't want to be a bother to you. No bother. Would you like some wine? No, not really. What I came to talk to you about was... Dan, aren't these beautiful? Father Jessie sent them. Thanks again, Father. Think I'll put them in the bedroom. Put them on the dresser, dear. That was a very nice gesture, Father, thank you. You're welcome. On second thought, I think I will have just a little wine. Carol. Carol, honey. Yes, dear? Would you get us some wine, please? Of course, darling. What I came to talk to you about was the incident at the church. I'm sorry I struck you. I know it was wrong of me to lose my temper. Apology accepted, Father. I didn't mean to call you a ni... Call you that. I mean, look. You're not one of those. You're a, well, you're a black man. CAROL: Dan? Honey? I can't find the wine. Excuse me, Father. I'll be right back. What the hell is this? Dan, I just want you to please be nice to him. What do you mean be nice to him? Dan, he's a man of God. A man... No nigger's a man much less a man of God! Oh, Dan, please. I don't want to talk about this. I hadn't had a chance to congratulate you yet. You're a very lucky man, Dan. Lucky hell. I just take what I want. There's no luck to that, Father. Well, I, uh... I better say good night. When do you plan to leave on the honeymoon? As soon as the trial's over. Probably be a couple of more days. CAROL: Leaving, Father, so soon? JESSIE: Yes, Mrs. Robert, I have a few more calls to make and I didn't want to overstay my visit. Oh, come by anytime. JESSIE: I hope I see you two in church Sunday. DAN: Possibly, Father. It all depends on the trial. (DAN CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) I love you. I love you. What is it? I love you. I love you too. Now go back to sleep. Carol. Honey, I've got to go to court in the morning at 8:00. Please go back to sleep. But I'm not sleepy. I wanna play. Carol, go play in the shower. Now I've gotta get some sleep. I'll be glad when this trial is over. Carol, where are you going? Nowhere. Aren't these beautiful? (SCREAMING) Operator, give me the police. Jack, it's Dan. Listen, come over right away. Damn it, Jack, get over here! Carol's been murdered. Jack, are you still there? No. Jack, I know who did it. I know who murdered her. (SIRENS WAILING) Hey, boys, hold on. The lady's dead. She's upstairs and don't touch anything till Hebert gets here with his crew from the coroner's office. Oh, and leave that snake alone too. Jim. Yeah. Better go up there and watch and make sure they don't mess up. Okay. HEBERT: Hey, Tony! Hello, Hebert. She's upstairs and there's a dead snake there too. Where's your crew? They're coming. Snake? Sure it's dead? Yeah, I'm sure it's dead, Hebert, now listen. I need a double set of photographs, special attention to the body position in the room. Now I don't want you to rush on this one. You know who this guy is, don't you? Yeah, I know. Okay, now do it right, hurry up, I want the body downtown fast with the snake. Gotcha. Okay. Now who'd you say you were again, sir? I'm Jack Markam, Dan's law partner. Oh, yeah, Mr. Markam. You handled that investment corporation scandal. I mean, case. That's right. Well, Lieutenant, what can I do to wind up this nightmare for you? Well, first thing you can do is ask Mr. Robert if he feels like talking now or later. Really, Lieutenant? Is that absolutely necessary? It's not only necessary, Mr. Markham, it's compulsory. Hey, boy, where do you think you're going? Oh, excuse me. This is Detective Bunch, my partner. This is... Who'd you say you were again? Markam, Jack Markam. Mr. Markam, this is Mr. Bunch. Mr. Markam is Mr. Robert's law partner. Hello. Excuse me. I'll wait outside, Tony. All right. Mr. Robert? Yes? We'll be through here in a little while. For tonight anyway. Be nice if you could answer a couple questions. What do you want to know? Dan, you know you don't have to say anything, don't you? That's right, Mr. Robert. You think about it. I'll be right back. (SIGHS) (GROANS) You honkies are crazy, you know that? What? You heard me, man, I said you honkies are crazy. What do you mean by that, Jim? Well, I mean, we shoot 'em or we cut 'em. But a snake? Shit. Hey, Jim. Who do you think that snake was really meant for? That's a good question. What do you say, Mr. Robert? Go ahead, Lieutenant. The snake, Mr. Robert, how do you think it got in the house? I haven't the faintest idea. Did Mrs. Robert have any enemies you know about, who you think might try something like this? No, none. Did you? No. Excuse me, Mr. Robert. Hey. (PRAYING INDISTINCTLY) If you are alive, may the Lord forgive you by the soul you know he and the sins you may have committed in this life. Blessed are thou Almighty God, Father. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Got your message. You call Vance yet? No. Call him now. (ROTARY PHONE DIALING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello, this is Father Jessie, Vance. I'm, uh... I'm at Dan's. Carol is... Carol is dead. What? Come right over, Carol is dead. Get dressed. Get dressed! Now can you tell me what you remember from the beginning, Mr. Robert? Especially about the snake. The snake struck at her from the bouquet. And by the time I'd killed it, Carol was... Well, what'd you do next? Called... I called the police and then I called Jack. You're an attorney, Mr. Robert. Doesn't it seem a little strange to you that a man's bride is murdered and the first thing he does is call his law partner? Now that's enough. Dan, you don't have to answer any more questions. Lieutenant, I suggest you get your facts straight. Mr. Robert called the police first and then he called me. I'll testify to that. Who said anything about testifying? I'm really sorry, Dan. I'm really sorry. (SHOUTING) DE VIVO: You know what kind of snake it is, Doc? Whoever killed it did one hell of a job. I haven't been able to identify it yet. But I did get the poison sack out and I sent it down to the lab along with some of her blood samples. I feel like a kid back in zoology class again. I haven't dissected a snake since then. Only people. Doc, how long would it take a snake bite to kill somebody? What do you mean? Well, you see, I have to know how long it'd take a snake to kill someone. If it took, like hours, then how come the husband didn't call sooner? That depends on where he came from and how it got in the victim. You won't believe it, Doc. It came in some flowers. (PHONE RINGING) Oh, excuse me. Pathology. Yeah. Asia? What do you mean, Asia? Wait a minute, let me get that down. Hold on. Spell it for me, will ya? E-L-A-P-I-D. Elapid. Hiya, Jim. Bungarus, yeah. Yeah. Wait, wait, not so fast. That's it, oh, good. Thanks a lot. Well, Jim, see you're still with the dynamic dago. (LAUGHS) Yeah, Doc, you know how it is. I let him move in my neighborhood and he ran it down. So I gotta stay with him til I can teach him a little culture, you know? Culture, that's what I need working around here. Come on, Doc, what do you got there? Your killer. Extremely venomous nocturnal elapid snake. Genus bungarus of eastern Asia and adjacent islands. Its venom can kill in seconds. Front fang, small, body approximately 12 inches in length. Venom paralyzes the nervous system. Victim suffocates. Asia. That's over 10,000 miles away. LABEWITZ: And from the location of the wound, I'd say it was accelerated. She was dead before she'd hit the floor, I'd estimate. Well, you boys have a lot of fun with this one. Yeah, okay, Doc. Thanks a lot. Come on, bro, buy you some lunch. Come again some other time, boys. (ORGAN PLAYING SOFTLY) Now, Dan, for Carol's parents' sake, please. All right, Jack. I promise. DAN: Feeling good, little brother? Playing with snakes make you feel better? More like a man? I don't know who you were after, but you're gonna die for this, I promise you that. Dan. (PHONE RINGING) (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Yeah? (DIAL TONE) (PHONE RINGING) Yeah? MAN: (ON PHONE) Mr. Robert? Yeah, who is this? My name is not important, Mr. Robert. Well, it's important to me. I don't talk to people I don't know. (PHONE RINGING) (SIGHS) Hello? MAN: Mr. Robert, don't hang up. I'm calling concerning a certain business transaction in New York City about a year and a half ago. Who is this? I demand to know who this is. Mr. Robert, we performed a certain service for you 17 months ago and we haven't been paid. We fulfilled our end of the agreement and we can't afford to extend credit if you know what I mean. Look, I thought I told you before... Mr. Robert, we've been through all that before. Your blaming us for your sister's untimely demise is foolish. You should have considered the consequences before you initiated the contract. We want payment in full, now. We don't have legal recourse, if you know what I mean. Is that a threat? Look, do you know who you're talking to? No threats, Mr. Robert. Are you trying to threaten me? No threats. We simply can't afford to let a client not make payment in full. It would ruin our professional reputation, if you know what I mean. You go to hell! (LIGHT THUMP) What are you doing? How long have you been here? Not long. Not long, Dan, please don't point that thing at me. You scared me to death. Well, what do you want? Wait a second, let me catch my breath. I wasn't sure before whether I wanted to finish what I came for. I think I'll just come back. What did you come for? Did my little brother send you? ANN: No. Vance didn't send me, I came on my own. What I wanted to talk about was... Well, I heard what you told Vance at Carol's wake. ANN: Aren't you gonna say anything? I don't believe he's a murderer. Dan? For God's sake, he's your brother. Doesn't that mean anything? You listen to me. My brotherly love died the night Carol was murdered. And I have my plans for the person I feel was responsible. Do you understand that? I'm going to marry Vance! I'm not going to let you manipulate our lives like you do with everyone else! I'm not going to be scared away by threats. Neither is Vance. That's a decision you may have cause to regret. Got you, Mr. Dan, I gotcha! Oh, Willie, stop! I can help you more alive than dead! You can't help my wife, Mr. Dismissed. Clara May's dead! You know that? She died on account of you. You're gonna die on account of me! (CRIES OUT) (GUN FIRING) VANCE: Hi, where you been? Nowhere, had to go by school for a while. I called, they said you'd left. Want a cookie? Well, you must have just missed me. Doesn't take an hour and a half to get here. What happened? Wouldn't you like to know? Oh. I catch you fooling around, huh? All this time I thought you loved only me. (GIGGLING) Hey, what are you talking, hey, hold on! I intend to. That's what I like about you, you're so damn subtle. JACK: Yes, I'm here now. Right. All right, I'll talk to you later. It's too bad you had to kill him. Now we'll never know his story. I know his story. What? Nothing. Nothing hell. Now, look, Lieutenant De Vivo... And you shut up! How come you're always on the scene before the police? JACK: Lieutenant, I resent that! Never mind, just sit down and stay out of my way. Would you like me to sit you down, Mr. Markam? Now, Mr. Robert, what's this I-know-his-story crap? If you know anything, you better tell me right now. Or I'll run your ass in so fast, it'll make your head spin. I don't care who you are, do you understand me? Hey, Tony... I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I don't know anything else. I'm really very sorry. I'm sorry. What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing? It's certainly not nothing. It's nothing, just drop it. You don't wanna talk about it. Well, I do wanna talk about it. Please, just drop it! Hey, where were you today? Something happened today and I want to know what it is! Look, it's no big thing. Well, how about letting me decide my half of what a big thing is? Okay! Okay. I went to see Dan on the boat, that's all. You did what? I went to see Dan. You just went and saw Dan? Yes, is there something wrong with that? Yeah, there's something wrong with that! I told you he was my business! Excuse me. I thought his threat was our business. To hell with his damn threats! Vance, grow up! Why don't you admit that he frightens you? He frightens me! Dan doesn't frighten me! I'm not afraid of him! I told you that before and I also told you to stop bugging me about him! (KNOCKING) Oh, shit. Yeah? Excuse me, Mr. Robert, is Miss Novak here? I'd like to talk to her. Come on in. Ann, it's Lieutenant De Vivo. Excuse me, I hope I didn't disturb anything. Yeah, well, you did. Vance. No, Lieutenant, what can I do for you? Miss Novak, I'd like to know where you were this morning. What do you want to know for? What difference does it make where she was this morning? Mr. Robert, do you mind? I'm asking the questions. Yeah, I do mind as a matter of fact! What right do you have to come in here... Vance, stop. I went to see Dan on the boat. Miss Novak, about what time was that? It was about 10:30, but I don't understand. DE VIVO: What time did you leave the boat? ANN: I don't know. I guess it was about... Oh, wait a minute. You don't have to answer any more of these questions! I'd like to know what this is all about. In the first place, I don't like being interrupted when I'm talking to someone. In the second place, it's my day off and I've got no time to fool around with you. And in third place, they've just thrown two homicides in my lap. Two weeks ago, or maybe you've forgotten, your sister-in-law was killed by some imported snake, and nobody wanted to say anything about that. And 30 minutes ago, your brother killed the family gardener. And you're trying to tell me about her rights? The hell is going on in this family? (DOGS BARKING) Come on, let's go. Man, what's happening? Nothing, man, nothing. Novak was there all right, and she was on the boat today too, but she doesn't know any more about it than we do. It's that family that's driving me up the wall. Let's get out of here, come on. Put Spinelli on. Well, he hasn't done anything since that Wesley Stewart St. Charles murder case. I wish I could help you, Bert, but I'm really jammed up. Yeah, hold on a second. Yeah, man. Ann Novak is here. Tell her to wait in the conference room, I'll be right in. Right. Yeah, Bert? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure he can handle it. Dago's honor. Yeah, okay. Well, let me know how it comes in. I'll talk to you later. I'm sorry, Miss Novak. What can I do to help you? Well... What I came about, Lieutenant... First let me say I'm sorry about the other day. Vance isn't like that. Well, his brother's always been a sore... Forget it, Miss Novak. What can I do to help you? Well, there's something I think you should know about. I've tried to get Vance to tell you, but he won't. Lieutenant, Vance has asked me to marry him. Oh, well, congratulations. Is that what you came down here to tell me? Did you know that Dan fired Willie just before Carol was killed? Yes, Miss Novak. Oh. Well, did you know Dan threatened Vance at Carol's wake? Threatened him, how? He accused Vance of murdering Carol. That's why I went to the boat, to talk to him. I don't mind telling you, Lieutenant, Dan scares me. Now you believe he meant that? People often say things under stress, Miss Novak. I think Dan meant it. Lieutenant, do you suspect Vance? This is a homicide case, Miss Novak. Everyone is a suspect. Everyone? Dan too? It's possible. Well, I feel a little better anyway. I just thought you should know. Well, you did the right thing, Miss Novak, and thank you. I wouldn't worry too much about idle threats. Thank you. Goodbye, Miss Novak. Hi, Charlie. How are things going? Normal Saturday, Mr. Robert, just checking things out. Okay, thanks a lot, Charlie. I don't care, Jack. I need that money now! Would you shut up and listen! I don't think they're gonna wait any longer. Well, what do you want to do? Okay, okay. Hey, what are you doing there? You come out, come on! (GUNS FIRING) He was just kneeling there in broad daylight with that gun! Okay, okay. In which direction was he pointing the weapon? Um, that way, south. He was right about here, huh? Yeah, kneeling. About like this? GUARD: Yeah, yeah. Just pointing out that way, huh? GUARD: Yeah. Hey, Tony. Think I got something here. What do you got? Take a look at this. That name mean anything to you? Coincidence? It's no coincidence, take a look out here. JIM: Yeah, I see what you mean. (PLAYFUL SHOUTING) Oh, you big turkey. Why would a gardener try to kill his boss? Why would a boss want to kill his gardener? Come on. It's amazing how many people hate Dan Robert. I mean his gardener tried to knife him. His brother may have hated him enough to plant a snake in his bedroom. And those guys from New York send a hitman down here to try and get rid of him. I can't figure it, Jim. Hey, you know, I only met him twice before myself, and I don't like him very much. What is that, 12-nothing? Hey, you know those guys from New York? Yeah. What did he have to do with them? What about his brother? If he missed the first time, you know, he could be trying again with some outside help. And we can't forget about the girlfriend. Hey, Tony. DE VIVO: Hi, Mike. Here's the message on the 10:26 to New York. Who's winning? Shit. Smartass. Just thought I'd ask. Goodbye, Mike. Records checked last five years show Robert yellow sheet indicates suicide. One Denise Robert, white, female, age 20. Home address New Orleans. Next of kin, Daniel Robert. Same address. Wonder if she hated him too. We could check on that. I got a feeling we're racing against time. Who's ever behind this hasn't finished yet. They haven't got to Dan Robert. Still think the brother's our best suspect. Possible, that could be. Let's take a shower, come on. JESSIE: May the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob be with you. And may he fulfill his blessings in you that you may see your children's children even to the third and fourth generation and thereafter have life everlasting. By the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with the Father and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, God world without end, amen. Well, are you gonna kiss her or are you gonna stand there grinning at me? Congratulations. Thanks, Jessie! (LAUGHING) Well... I'm sorry I was a little late. Things could have been so much better for this. Hey, what is it? It's Dan. Did you invite him? VANCE: Yeah, I sent him a note. Kind of a peace offering. Oh, I wish he'd come. I mean, we're all the family that's left. I love him, he's my brother. Oh, he'll come around. After we get back from New York, you'll see. Hey, you're going to New York. Yeah. A little business and a lot of pleasure. Well, thanks again. See you when we get back. Good luck to you, Vance. Thank you. Good luck to both of you. (SCREAMING) Ann? Ann! What is it? Ann! Oh, Jesus, he killed her, Jessie, he killed her! Who's there? (CRIES OUT) Why, you son of a... (GUN FIRING) (GROANS) For God's sake, Father, help me, please. Man, that was one hell of a shot. You know you really should have been there. I don't know who your man was, but the cat is good. I mean, in 'Nam we use a much smaller caliber of weapon, but that thing, man, that thing blasted his ass apart. And there we were. Me, my twin brother, the priest. His little white chick. On a picnic. That's a heavy scene in itself, can you dig that? This black Catholic priest and his pregnant honky whore. If I burn my brother's body. Man, I burned my brother's body. So I figure that the Roberts have got to get theirs too. You see, I figure I got me some dues to pay. And I might as well start with the first Robert I know. I took Denise's diary. I took all my brother's things. His priest's habit. His briefcase. Everything. You see, I took his place. I even called the church. Asked them to let me spend a year in the monastery just so I could get the moves down, you understand? I mean, I took his place. Everything worked out fine. (CHUCKLING) I bet you're wondering about that snake, huh? A little VC trick I learned in 'Nam. Hey, I got Ann too. That's why that knife's sticking out of your chest. (LAUGHING) I got you all. This jive ass nigger got you all. And you know what? It was easy! Ahhh! Easy! (GROANS) (LAUGHING) (DOG BARKING) (SIRENS WAILING) (LAUGHING) All we do is wait around. Yeah, man. It's hot out here too. Oh, no, no, Father, I can... Heard you're taking a trip. Yep. Thank you, Lieutenant. Shit!
