You are never here! You like it when I'm upset? It's your fault that we're even here! What? thought it would make a difference! Oh, that's rich! I'm tired of this, Iris! Every day is the same with you. Every day! What? will never understand you. Never have, why start now? We moved to the mountains, to a beautiful house, for a new beginning and nothing has changed! It was your idea to move us up here! Because What? thought it was going to help. Now, all What? ask is for you to take your meds. You know what they do to me! What? know what it does when you don't take them. Your mind spins out of control. When's the last time you even left this house? We've lived here, what, a year? You never go into town, we've never met our neighbours. You have no friends! That's as much your fault as it is mine. What? work, Iris! What? go down that mountain every morning and What? don't get back till late. What? have no time! All right! Sophia, get away from those stairs! Sophia! Come on. Looks kind of scary. Just needs some love. Maybe some paint, little carpentry. With a little TLC, it'll be fine, trust me. That window's broken. Yeah. There's a few things that are broken, sweetie. But we're gonna fix them! It's even more yucky inside. Well, you just gotta give it a chance, honey. What? have big plans for this place. Where are we gonna sleep? Right here. We have sleeping bags until the furniture comes. This is our home now. It's gonna be fun! Come on, let's start cleaning this place up, OK? Oh, my gosh! Well, good news - upstairs isn't nearly as bad as down here. Hey, good job. This is fun, right? Erm, sure. Hello? Anybody home? Hey, come on in. You must be the contractor. Yes, ma'am. So, you bought this place? Guilty as charged. I'm Robyn Flynn. Call me Drew. This is my daughter, Ava. Hi, Ava. Hi. This place has been empty for years. Time hasn't been so good to her. So, where are you two staying while the work's being done? We have sleeping bags. That's right. And I'm gonna do as much of the work as What? can myself. Like paint and... Well, paint! I'll need you to do the rest. I'm more of a big picture gal. Oh, really? Robyn's kind of a big deal. Aw. I'm an interior designer. WAS an interior designer, in San Francisco. Is that right? Well, it sure is a big house for just two people. That's why we bought it. What? plan to fix up the rooms and rent them out on Airbnb. It's a website where home owners can rent out their rooms to people from all over the world. That would make sense. It's a good place for it, it's gorgeous around here. See? There. Just like camping. What? guess. The rest of our stuff will be coming tomorrow. All our beds and our furniture. It'll start to feel like home. Nothing feels like home. You don't see schools like this in the city. Hi. ls this where pick-up is after school? Around the back. Oh, OK, around the back. Good morning. Are you our new student? What? Guess. I'm Mrs Burman. What? have two kids that go here, as well. Sarah's in your class. She's very excited to meet you. Where's your mom? Hi. I'm Robyn. What? see you've met my daughter, Ava. Oh. I'm sorry, What? didn't... Oh, no. That happens. Nice to meet you, I'm Erica Burman. Hi. Why don't you go head inside? Have a good day. How funny. Are you the ones that bought the old house on Maple Street? That's us, yeah. This place really is spectacular, isn't it? It is. We moved here a few years ago for the amazing schools and you don't get views like this in Sacramento. No. What? work just down the mountain and it's a little trying, but it's worth it. Yeah. Well, it's good to hear that, makes me think we did the right thing coming here. Oh, I'm sure of it. And, hey, What? live right around the corner, so if you ever need anything, just call. I'm in the school directory. Thanks. Well, What? better make my way down the hill and get to work. I'll see you soon. OK, you too. Are you Iris? Are you the one going up to Lake Pines? All right. Well, come on, get in. I'll take you up. Drew? You here? In here! You're here early. It's after eight, that's not early. You got running water in the kitchen and no leaks. Excellent. So, what can What? do? Well, you said you can paint, right? What? hope so! What? paid enough for that fancy design school. The front bedroom's ready. Go for it. Yes, sir, General, sir! You are a general contractor, right? You don't have to salute. There you are. Finished the front bedroom. Did you paint any of the walls or just yourself? Everyone's a critic. What? paint very inspirationally. I've got half an apple to share. No, thanks. Not hungry. Got so much to do. Hmm. You got a little... What? Paint? Yeah. Did What? get it? Here. There we go. All done. Thanks. So, why did you choose our pretty little town to settle in? As you may have noticed, Ava and What? don't exactly look alike. What? might have noticed something. What? adopted Ava a few years ago. Her parents died in a car accident. I'm so sorry. Poor Ava. Her mom, Tashi, and What? were best friends growing up. She didn't have any relatives young enough to take Ava, and her husband was a great guy, but his family was complicated. So, this godmother thing was the real deal. If anything happened to them, What? had to be ready to become a mom. That's pretty serious business. And What? said What? would take it seriously. Still, you never think it's actually gonna happen. What was that like? The adjustment must have been hard. What? tried to throw myself into it, for Ava. For Tashi. But What? was still working a pretty demanding job, so that meant long hours. About a year ago, we were driving around place to place and I'm buckling Ava in and she says... "..The world is spinning too fast. "Would that happen if my real mom were here?" Yeah. Before Ava, my whole life was about my career. And then suddenly, What? had another person to take care of and it felt good. Suddenly, work wasn't so important. Becoming a real mom to her was what mattered. So, What? got us out of the city to a place where she can grow, and here we are. Seemed like a perfect place for a B&B. Price was right. What do you know about the history of this place? The family who owned it experienced a tragedy. Tragedies have a way of changing people's lives, you know. Sounds awful. It was. It's part of our town's history. One we're not too proud of. And then, after the accident, the parents left and never came back. Gossip was the mother went off her rocker. Her husband had to put her in an institution. Wow. Such a sad story. What were they like? What? never met either of them. No-one in town did. Apparently, she was a real recluse, he was never home. So, you've lived here all your life? What? better get back to work. Yeah. What? got a lot to do, too, if this place is gonna be a B&B any time soon. So, What? was thinking maybe a pale yellow for the dining room? That's a good colour for a B&B, right? Yeah, that sounds nice. Hey, Drew, What? found the paint swatch. What do you think about "Lake Pines B&B"? Sounds good to me. How about a pedestal sink in the downstairs bathroom? What? think we can do that. Why don't we tackle that after... Hello. Hello. I'm Robyn Flynn. Beth Barone. Hi. What? heard in town that this is a 5&5? It is, but we're not quite open yet. And who's this beautiful child? This is my daughter, Ava. Hello, Ava. Hello. What? know it's strange, me showing up without notice, but I'd love to take a room here. We're really supposed to take our reservations through the website. And we're not even online yet. What? just feel like What? belong here. I've... I've got money. Is this enough? What? guess it should be fine. I'll help you with your bags. Already got it! That's it? What more do What? need? Well, come on in. What? got it. Thank you. Just right upstairs here. Just down this way. OK. Right over here. This room has an awesome view of the grounds. Could What? stay in that room instead? It's a smaller room. That's fine. What? like cosy. OK, whatever you like. OK. It's perfect. Well, we should let you get settled. What? hope we find some time to get to know each other, Ava. Come on, sweetie. Ready? Yeah. Say "Limburger." Cheese! It's perfect. Let me see! That's it! That's our homepage picture. Well, looks like my work's here's done. That's the most fun I've ever had with a hammer and a screwdriver. What? know, it was fun. But there's another room to look at and something always needs fixing, so I'm sure we'll see you a bunch. What? just hope that... What? What? want you to be careful, that's all. You're gonna have a lot of strangers in your house. World's full of all kinds of different people. Well, we always know where the "General" is. You call if you need me. And, you, you stay away from all them boys. You got a friend and you got my number. Use it any time. OK, you ready? Yeah. And we're live. Let's get some sleep, yeah? Yeah. Oh, What? forgot to tell you! Drew told me about this amazing waterfall just outside of town. What do you say you and me hike up to it on Saturday morning? Don't you have to work? Work? Babe, that's our old life. Now that we're here, we have all the time in the world for each other. Am What? doing enough for her, Tashi? What? hope I'm making you proud. Sophia, get away from those stairs! What did you do?! Sophia. Forgive me, darling. Mommy made a mistake. What? lost my way. What? let our home go to strangers. Don't worry, darling. I'll get rid of these people invading our home. Then we'll be together again, baby. Oh, my gosh! Ava! Ava! Ava! Are we going to the waterfall now? No, we have guests! But today's the waterfall day, it's Saturday. You said that we could go today. What? know, babe, but these are paying customers. Real actual people paying money to come to our house today. They're gonna be staying with us for clays, sometimes longer. We're gonna have to get used to that and make the house nice for them. OK? OK. Mr and Mrs Willis. Yes. We've been expecting you. I'm Robyn Flynn. Your home is so beautiful, Miss Flynn. Angie saw it online and just fell in love with it. You have such a flair for decoration. Thank you! Well, let's get you upstairs. Your room has a beautiful view of the mountains. Ooh, lead the way! That is quite a view. That's amazing! So pretty! This was actually built in 1884. Really? So there's some great architecture. Yeah! Oh, my gosh, it's beautiful. The stained glass windows alone are... This where we check-in? Yes, welcome. I'm Robyn Flynn. You must be Mr and Mrs Lannier? No, we're not married. Hi. Heather Russell. Welcome. Clint, can you stop oogling long enough to take my bag? Yeah. Why don't What? show you to your room? Thanks. Do you have one of those little fridges that has booze in it? Um, no licence. Sorry. Really? Yeah. But there's a great... Sorry! Is everything OK? Yeah. Oh, What? gotta go pick up Ava. Do you need anything before What? go? No. What? could go meet here, though. Oh, no, that's OK. What? like getting out and meeting the neighbours. Bye. OK. Bye! I'm gonna go downstairs. I'll wait for you. Can you get me some OJ? Thanks. Well, that's a pleasant surprise. So, your name's Beth, right? I'm Clint. I'm just down the hall. Oh, my God! What the hell?! Keep your filthy hands off me! Clint, what the hell are you doing?! I... Nothing! What rock did you crawl out from under? Would you keep this guy on a leash? OK, could you just hold on a second? Oh, my God! You know what, What? can't believe you! Not again! Heather! I'm done! OK, OK! You know, she slapped me out of the blue! What? didn't lay a single finger on her, Heather! What? didn't touch her! Really, really?! Do you think I'm blind or just stupid? Both, obviously. This is none of your damn business. You set me up! You never should've been here in the first place, you pieces of trash! Both of you, get out! Hey, you're just a guest here. What? was leaving anyway, so stay out of it! No, no, no, no! No, no! You listen to me. What is going on in here?! Nothing more than a lovers' quarrel. You two did this? She's crazy! What? already paid my money. All What? need from you is to stay out of my business and make me some damn pancakes in the morning. That's all What? need. Listen, sir... The bottom line is, dreamboat here got sexual with me and his lady caught him. It all went downhill from there. OK. You two need to leave. Now! Fine, fine. Go. Get your stuff and go. Ex-boyfriend here might be a spineless, little worm, but nobody treats me this way. I'm going to enjoy destroying your business. And What? expect a full refund. Animals. Good thing What? stopped them when What? did. She was ready to tear that room apart. Thank you. What? can get this room back up and running in no time. Yeah? Oh. Drew, this is Beth. Beth, Drew, our contractor, and friend. Good to meet you, Beth. Oh, they made such a horrible mess. Yeah. Well, no, What? understand. What? understand that it's not your fault. But my husband has a heart condition. What? thought this was supposed to be a relaxing place. What? just can't have him getting all worked up over some crazy people in the room next door. What? know, I'm sorry. They're gone. And What? promise we will do a better job of vetting our guests. I'm really sorry, What? just can't stay in this place, so we're leaving as soon as Stan gets back. Oh. I'm sorry. But... No, it's fine. What? gotta go pick up Ava at school. L'd be happy to 90- What? was gonna ask if you can stay for the exterminator, he's gonna be here soon. You should stay, handle your guests. What? could go meet her. What? would never ask you to do that. It's nothing, really. Are you sure? Of course. OK. It's just a couple of blocks down Maple. Just tell her I'm so sorry What? couldn't make it. Everything's gonna be OK. Go. Talk to Mrs Willis. Thanks. Hey! Hey! Why the hell did you do that? What? think we've been over this. You can slither away now. See, What? can't, because my girlfriend just left with my car. What's wrong with you? What? couldn't have your negative energy polluting my house. You're a nutjob! Because that, that is not even your house. It's always been my house! And it will always be my house. Iris? Hi, Erica. What are you doing here? My kids go to school here. What? heard you got released from Pine Vista. That's really good, Iris. What? didn't know you'd come back to town. Why didn't you call me? I'm trying to get away from all that... ...past. What? understand. Are you waiting for someone? No. So, do you think it's a good idea to be back here? I'm sorry. We all have our own ways of coping. How are you feeling? Are you taking your meds? I'm fine. She's gone, you know. What? know. Well... if you ever wanna talk, you can always come back to Pine Vista and visit me. Stay safe. OK? Hello! What? didn't see you there. Hi. Robyn texted me saying you were gonna take me home? Yeah, won't that be fun? Oh! Mrs Flynn! Mrs Flynn, hi. What? just wanted to say hello and tell you how much What? love having your wonderful daughter in my art class. You must be so proud of Ava. Oh, yes, What? am. She is such a special child. Well, whatever you two are doing at home, keep it up. You two have a great day, OK? Bye, Ava. Bye. I'll see you tomorrow, all right? OK. Bye. Bye- She thought you were my mom. Why didn't you tell her? That wouldn't be so bad, would it? We'll talk about this when we get home. How about that? Oh, no. That's terrible. They both left? Do you know what happened to the Lanniers? What? did not know that having people in my house would make me this paranoid. You want to know what kind of people you let into your home. That's understandable. Yeah. And What? have to think of Ava first. You're an amazing person, Robyn, and you've got good instincts. Yeah, you've got to watch out for Ava. So, what are your instincts telling you now? Maybe What? should just shut it down. Ask Beth to leave. No more B&B. Clear everybody out. I'm home! Hey, Drew. Hey, girlfriend! Hey, baby, how was school? Good. Hey, Beth. Hi. What? heard you were keeping the guests in line. Can What? help? Did you finish your homework? What? did it at school. Smart girl. Hello? Yes. OK, yeah, that would be great. Thank you. That was The Chronicle. They want to run a story on the B&B. We better get to work. So, you make any new friends at school? Not a lot. Maybe Mindy and James. 'James, huh?I What? thought What? told you to stay away from the boys. Wait. You're a boy. Oh, no, What? don't count. Yes, you do. Erm, we're out of paint. Oh. I'll go grab some from downstairs. We'll be back, babe. OK. Meet you back here? OK. OK. I'll see you in a few minutes. Robyn! Oh, my God. Oh, oh! Robyn. Did she die? Robyn, wake up. She can't die, too! Robyn. It's OK, darling. You're going to be OK, What? promise. Help her! You're gonna be OK. Help her! OK, OK. We've got to wake her up. Robyn, Robyn? Open your eyes, Robyn. Robyn, please wake up. Robyn! Please! It's OK, it's OK, darling. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, please. Robyn, wake up. Wake up! Wake up, please! Open your eyes, Robyn. Oh! Oh, my God! Are you OK? I'm here, I'm here for you. Oh, my God. What happened? The ladder slipped out from under me. Bet she has a concussion. We better take her to the emergency room. She may have to stay a couple of days. I'll be happy to look after Ava for you. No, no. Ava needs to come with us. Thanks, Beth. OK. Come on, let's go. Lean on me. I'm OK, What? can walk. Easy now. Slow. Where's your purse? I'm fine. Your vitals are all good, but What? want to run some scans. Can't take concussions lightly. It's best if someone watches you for the next few days. I'd be happy to help. What? can, too. You have school, babe. It's settled, then. Scans can wait for tomorrow and it would be best if you stayed off your feet. I'll be back. Thanks. Miss Flynn? No. I'm her very dear friend. In fact, I'm her daughter's godmother. Hi, I'm Sam from the Lake Pines Chronicle. What? talked to Miss Flynn earlier about doing a piece in our newspaper on her B&B. Is she home? What are you gonna do with that? Erm, What? was going to take some pictures for our paper. No, you're not. Maybe I'll come back later when Miss Flynn's home. What? guess you haven't heard about this place. It's cursed, you know. Oh. Oh, What? was so worried! They didn't want to keep you overnight? It's a concussion for sure, but the doctor said it would be OK for me to come home. Is there What? can do to help? Erm... Why don't you go inside with Beth? I'll be in, in a little bit, OK? What? can stay, if you want me to. What? am supposed to be resting, you know. My dad said that you know you care about someone when you worry about them. Pops was right. You had me pretty worried. Well, I'm glad you were here. I've been wanting to do that for a while. Come on. Let's get you inside. OK. Yeah, of course. Robyn, I'll check in on you. I'm a light sleeper, anyway. Thank you so much, Beth. Yeah. Are you OK enough to read together, Robyn? Of course, babe. No little bump on my head is gonna keep me away. Oh, no. What? just remembered there's a guest that's arriving soon at the train station. What? gotta go pick him up. Well, tell him he can't stay. What? can't do that, babe. He confirmed online and everything. What? gotta go get him. What? can read her her story. You should go. She'll be fine. She's a strong girl. OK. Come on. Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're going? There's a guest at the train station, What? gotta go pick him up. No, you are gonna stay right here. Doctor's orders was bed rest. I'll go pick up your guest. Thank you. No, thank you for letting me be a part of your family. What do you think? What's going on in your favourite class? It's dramatic. Super fun! Yeah! You rest. What? got you covered. Is that your real mom and dad? I'm so sorry. Little girl belongs with her mother. So, where's the book? There is no book. This is a brand-new story. One that no-one's ever heard, no-one in the whole, wide world. It's the story of a little girl. How old was she? Exactly your age. What was her name? Sophia. Princess Sophia lived in a land, a land filled with magic. What kind of magic? The kind where if anyone ever got hurt, magic would make them all better again. Who got hurt? Yes. And her mother, the Queen, was judged by everyone and locked away in the most awful dungeon, while an evil witch stole Sophia away from her and pretended to be her mother, while the witch lived in the castle with Sophia. So, how does it end? Well, the Queen is released from her prison, she's reunited with Sophia. But first, she has to rid the castle of all the witch's protectors, so she can kill the witch in peace. That's kind of a sad story. Yes, it is, Sophia. I'm Ava. Of course you are, sweetheart. Mr Marcus? Professor Marcus. Now, you must be from Lake Pines Bed and Breakfast. No... Yes. I'm a family friend. Huh. Well, thank you for coming to get me. It was an interminably tedious trip to get here. No problem. My truck's waiting right outside. Ah, Mr Marcus. Professor. Sorry? It's Professor Marcus. Oh. Professor, so happy to have you. Welcome to our home. I'm Robyn Flynn. Pleasure. If you could take my bags upstairs, please. Thank you. Yes, sir. What? would be happy to. I'll show you to your room. Thank you. Right this way, Professor. We've got our best room for you right here at the end of the hall. I'm sure you're probably wondering why I've come alone. Not your typical tourist by any means. So, to save you any unnecessary speculation, I've come to research a book I'm writing. Oh, that's exciting. You'll be our first author. What is your book about? Murder. Thanks again for today. What? don't know what What? would've done without you. You are very welcome. Are you sure you don't want me to stay? What? mean, on the couch, of course. Just to help you out? What? would like you to stay, but... ...another time maybe? Definitely maybe. Thanks again, for everything. Hey, Erica. Afternoon, Robyn. How's your poor head? Oh, finally starting to feel a little better. Thanks for picking up Ava. Don't mention it, we love Ava. Bye, Ava. Bye, Mrs Burman. KIDS IN BACK-SEAT: What? don't like him. There is no note in my backpack. There's a note in your backpack! Just let me see it! No! Ava, could you give us two seconds? OK. No, it isn't! What? don't have it! Something wrong with Ava? No, Ava's fine. It could be nothing. I just wondered... No, no, no! Jimmy, Sarah, sit down! Maybe we can talk later, maybe somewhere a little more private? Yes, What? think we should. What? just have to get these kids home. Maybe you can come by the hospital? What? work the night shift tonight, but What? get off at 8AM. OK, I'll see you at eight. Great. Yes, he did! Thanks again. No! Just give me the bag. What? need the note! I'm gonna run this to the dumpster. Be right back. Hello, Erica. Do you really think What? would let you keep me from Sophia? She's gone, Iris. It's not Sophia. It's not... Wake up! It's Saturday, and you promised this Saturday was waterfall day. Shoot, honey. What? gotta go meet Mrs Burman this morning. But why? What? don't know. It sounded important, though. We can't go again? But you promised. We don't spend any time together and What? don't even have my friends in the city any more. What? know, honey. We're gonna go as soon as things get a little less crazy, OK? What? promise. Good morning. Why the long face, kiddo? I'm supposed to go to the waterfall, but she cancelled it, again. Really? Do you think What? could come? What? think so. Yeah? What? can ask. Yeah. What? am screwing this up with Ava already. You're doing just fine, Robyn. What? don't know. Sometimes it seems like we really are mother and daughter, and then other times it's crystal clear that I'm an impostor, not her real mom. Once you get your feet under you, everything will settle into place. You got this, Robyn. Glad somebody has confidence in me. Oh, What? gotta go. Something's happening here. What? What? don't know yet. I'll talk to you later. Excuse me. What's going on? Can What? ask what you're doing here, ma'am? I'm supposed to meet someone here, Erica Burman? Erm... Did something happen? ls Erica OK? I'm sorry. Ms Burman is deceased. Oh, my God. It looks like it could be an accident. "Could be"? What does...? We've got people still working on it. Why were you meeting Mrs Burman? She wanted to talk to me about something. What about? What? don't know. Whatever it was, she wanted to tell me in private. Excuse me, Detective, we're getting ready to move the body. OK. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. "Iris"? It's awful. We're all in shock. Did she seem all right the last time you saw her? What? guess so. What? mean, you know Erica. She was always so happy, so positive. What? think she wanted to talk to me about something important. Does the name Iris mean anything to you? I'm sorry, no. Maybe Iris works here or she's a patient? Maybe a friend of Erica's? It's my responsibility to protect the privacy of our patients here. You understand? Of course. Thanks for your help. Erica ain't coming no more? What? don't think so. I'm sorry. She was always nice to us. You knew Erica? She talked to us like real people, not a nurse. Do you know Iris? She talks to ghosts. What? think it's her daughter. Can What? talk to Iris? Iris turned into a ghost, too. She died. She walked right out through a wall. Then she was gone. Follow me. Who drew this? Iris. The house where her daughter died. Can What? keep this? Sure. Thank you. You be careful of ghosts now. The worst ones are up here. Hi! Hi. Is everything OK? No. Something terrible happened. What? know I'm just a guest here, Robyn, but I'd also like to think we'd become friends. You can tell me anything. Thanks. Mrs Burman, a mom at Ava's school, died at her work last night. Oh, no. That's horrible. Yeah. Some sort of accident at the hospital. Ava and What? just talked to her yesterday. Why does everybody have to die? Oh, sweetie. First Mommy and Daddy, and then Mrs Burman. It's not fair. Nope. Mrs Burman's kids have to grow up without a mom. It's gonna be so hard. Well, they have friends who care about them and family who love them. You're not going away, are you? What? know you're not really my mom. No, no, babe. What? could never replace your mom, but What? love you more than anything. What? just do. What? loved you when What? saw you in the hospital for the first time. And your mom was holding you and she was so proud. And when What? look at you, What? see her. She was about your age when we met, you know. I'd just moved to a new school and we were in third grade, and we used to play tetherball together. What? like tetherball. Yeah? You wanna see if you can beat me? Get it, get it! That's fascinating! That's a search that What?, too, have performed with the same results, or, should What? say, lack of results. I'd appreciate it if you didn't sneak up on me, Professor. Oh! What? do apologise. What? am, What? suppose, a part-time sleuth and can't help being rather light of foot when the occasion demands. What? thought you were an author? Investigative author, yes. What? write books about famous, or What? should say infamous, murders. Catchily titled "Mother Murderers." Perhaps you've seen the series? Currently, I'm on book seven. It's rather an important franchise. They're considering turning it into a television show. So, Iris Janaway... are you going to write a book about this house? Not a book, a segment. And not the house, but the individual. Though, of course, the scene of the crime is always vividly described. What? haven't been able to find any pictures of her or what she looked like, so... Fascinatingly, What? have not been able to find any photographs of her, too. Which won't do, I'll need one at least for the book jacket. Nothing on the internet. The nut house turned me down as a matter of course, but then What? heard that the scene of the crime is open for business, so What? came hot-foot. Only to find you searching for a photograph of her, too. The plot, as they say, thickens. Why is that? You know, Professor, What? don't know if What? really want you to write anything about what happened in this house. Au contraire, Miss Flynn. If What? put your little B&B in the Mother Murderers seven, then my fans will swarm down on you, like bee and bees, dare What? say it, to a honey pot. Some will probably claim that the place is haunted and then you'll never be empty again. Sorry, Professor, What? really can't talk with you about this right now. What? do hope you'll drop it, though. Oh, I'm afraid What? can't do that, Miss Flynn. What? have a very promising appointment in the morning with your town's registrar of records, and What? am going to see what What? can dig up about Ms Janaway. You see, What? will uncover the truth. We're getting two new guests today, newlyweds. That's great! What? just didn't have the heart to cancel on them, and Ava and What? talked and we really wanna make this B&B thing work. Miss Flynn? Miss Flynn? Looking for someone? Yes, What? was looking for Miss Flynn. What did you want with her? Nothing. Thank you. What? understand you're writing a book? Yes. Mummy Murderers Seven. What's that about? Surely you've heard the story of the tragedy that occurred in this very house, Miss...? Barone. Beth Barone. Well, the mother of the house, a certain Iris Janaway, murdered her seven-year-old daughter here, Sophia Janaway. It wasn't murder, it was an accident. Well, that's not what What? heard. It was an accident. The court records would suggest she had mental difficulties, and during an episode, she pushed her daughter down the stairs. Such a beautiful girl. Where did you get that?! What? also managed to find a photograph of the mother. What? would love to interview her, just so that What? could get her part of the story. What? would like to be able to fairly represent her in my book. What did you say your name was? Iris... Hmm. ..Janaway. Iris, would you like to tell me the truth of what happened the day your daughter was murdered? See you at the house later. I'm going epic on brunch. Perfect, since What? have an epic appetite. Professor? Why don't we go ahead and step outside here for a minute? All right. So when did you leave the house this morning, Miss Flynn? About 7:45. What? dropped my daughter off at school and then went to Ingram's for groceries. So, when did you get back? Maybe 9:45, maybe it was later. What? can't say for sure. Well, we're gonna have to get everyone out the house. It's now a crime scene. OK. What? understand. I'll take care of it. What? just want to apologise to you both. This was supposed to be our honeymoon. What? know. I'm refunding your room and What? can arrange alternate places to stay. This must be awful for you and your daughter. We understand and we'll find some place else to stay. What? really appreciate your understanding. What? do. This was in a room. Looks like some remodelling's going on. So? The screwdriver is missing. Come here. Who does this belong to? It's my contractor's, it's Drew's. Drew? Wayne Aldrew? No, What? think it's just Drew. Contracting By Drew. Yeah, that's Wayne. We know him. So, now when did Professor Marcus check in here? What? think it was Tuesday. Tuesday. Think we found our murder weapon, Sheriff, in the bushes outside. When was the last time you saw Wayne Aldrew? Last night. Why? Robyn! What's going on? It's the Professor. Oh, God! ls he...? And Drew did it? That's what they said, but there's no way. Drew couldn't do that. Oh, that's awful. Is there anything What? can do to help? What? had to tell all the other guests to find other accommodations. I'm gonna have to ask you to do the same. What?! Why me? Things are just too unstable right now. What? need to let things settle down before What? handle any guests again. If What? ever have guests again. Did you find a car? What? told you, What? wanna see a lawyer. What? heard what you told me. Public defender's on his way in. ROBYN: Stayed in the house for a few days... So, until he gets here, let's go over this one more time. When exactly did you start this job for Miss Flynn? Sheriff, you're not listening to me. What? had no reason to hurt that man. Found these in the Professor's room. Why was he investigating you? What? What? have no idea. What? only ever met the man at the train station. Are you sure about that? You didn't find out that he was trying to put you in that book he was writing? That doesn't make any sense. We've got your screwdriver with the victim's blood on it, that documentation that he was investigating you, and you don't have an alibi. And forensics got some pretty good prints off that screwdriver of yours. What? didn't do it, Sheriff. Yeah. Wayne, What? thought What? knew you, son. What? know you were a troubled kid, but What? never expected this. Come on. Stand up. Come on. Turn around. I'm arresting you for the murder of Jameson Marcus. Come on. Drew? It wasn't me, Robyn. You gotta believe me. I'm sorry, there's things What? should've told you, but I'm not a murderer. Something's going on here, Robyn. Someone's trying to set me up! All right. There you go. Robyn, are we gonna be OK? We are gonna be OK. What? promise. Don't worry, darling. I'll get rid of these people invading our home. What? have one final problem to take care of. So she can kill the witch in peace. We'll be together again, baby. PHONE RINGS Robyn, I'm out on bail. Sheriff Sculley doesn't really think What? did it, but What? guess I'm his only suspect. But how can you even be a suspect, Drew? What? know you didn't do it, but how can they think you did? The truth is, Robyn, What? got a past in this town. What? was a pretty wild kid. One night, What? went for a joy ride with my best friend, Josh. Somehow, What? lost control, What? hit a tree. What? came out OK, but Josh... ..well... ..he didn't. Anyways, Sheriff's office felt a small town criminal got off easy and they held a grudge. I'm sorry What? didn't tell you all this sooner, Robyn. What? swear to you, What? did not kill Marcus. And that screwdriver was mine, but someone else took it. Who'd even want to do that? Anyone who's been in your house had access to my tools. You need to be careful, Robyn, because whoever did this is still out there. What about those people who wrecked their room? What? still have their contact information. What? could have Sheriff Sculley check it out. Robyn? Are you there? Drew, something's wrong. My will was open on my computer. Who could have done this? Oh, my God. Iris Janaway was on my computer. She made herself Ava's guardian. Oh, God. What? Beth. Beth is Iris Janaway. Beth is the one who's behind everything. I'm not a bad person, Robyn, but I'll do what What? have to, to get what's mine. What? Robyn! Stay away from me. This is my house. Robyn, what's going on? Beth, you need help. Robyn, answer me! Sh! You don't wanna wake the baby. Robyn! Robyn! Come and get her, Drew! Open the door! Let me out! Let me out now! Stop! Robyn? Robyn, what's going on? Go back in your room! I'm not leaving you. Let's go. Ah! What? never meant to hurt you, Sophia! I'm not Sophia! I'm Ava! This isn't going to work, Beth! Of course it's going to work! What? know what I'm doing! None of this would have ever happened if you didn't invade my home! What? will keep Sophia safe. You're crazy! Should we go? Drew's on his way, let's just stay in here. Should we go? Come on, sweetie. Robyn? Where are you? What? Robyn! Are you upstairs? Go in my room, hide under my bed, don't come out. Promise me. OK. Drew, we're up here. Robyn, Ava. Where is she? What? don't know where she is. No! I'm taking what's mine! She's not your daughter, she's mine! Leave my mom alone! Sophia! Mommy's sorry. Sophia forgave Mommy. No, darling, it wasn't my fault. What? love you! Darling, Sophia! I'm sorry. Sophia. OK. Sophia. I'm sorry. We're gonna take you in and get that fixed up. Don't forget about Robyn's leg. We're gonna have matching scars. Thank you. I'm sorry. What? should've told you everything. No apologies. Not tonight. Hey, how's Beth? Well, her neck's broken. They say she'll never move again. We got quite a mess here, Miss Flynn. Are you gonna help us sort it all out? Well, that's gonna have to wait, Sheriff Sculley, cos we have got to take your hometown hero here to the hospital tonight. All right. Looks good, guys. Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! Subtitles by Red Bee Media
