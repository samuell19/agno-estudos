-Good morning, doctor. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. I carried this all the way here. It might already be dementia. Should I see a neurologist? The other day, I cooked pasta in a kettle. It was delicious. Really. She wants to become a man, doctor. See, she shaves her hair. -We are OK with it. When she turns 18. -I'm not. You are! -She can do it once she's 18. -You're humiliating me! What surgery? Don't you see how unhappy she is? We can't take this any longer. Maybe you can help us. Alright. Please wait outside while I talk to Esma alone. I miss you so much. I miss you, too. I guess it's quite warm there. I guess you're warm, too. Come on, relax. What will you do to me? Will you hold me? Will you caress me? I'm touching you right now, from head to toe. Come. Come into my arms. I'll take you to bed. Come on. Get up. Come on, get up! Hey! Wait! -How are you, Mom? -Thank God you're here. I'm itching all over. Can you have a look? Then you'll give me the injection. Look. -It's red, isn't it? -Yes, it is. Thanks, my dear. Yusuf kills animals, doctor. Once I followed him after school. There's a barn next to the school. Yusuf went inside, I followed him. I saw him holding a lamb covered in blood. But Yusuf didn't seem upset at all. I got angry and I scolded him. Of course he got sad. Am I right, Yusuf? Yusuf? What did you do to the lamb? Why did you do it? It was getting on my nerves. I see. I got this present for you. Don't worry about the length, if the shoulders and waist fit we'll have it adjusted. OK? It looks good on you. -Good evening, Mom. -Good evening, dear. -How are you, Mom? -So-so. -How are you feeling? -My back is pretty bad. Did you speak to the imam? Stop it, Mother. You're obsessed with him. Forget the imam. Give it to me. Please, God. Please, God. Don't be scared. Please don't be afraid of me. Duman. My boy. Come here, my boy. Come here, my love. Come here, sweetheart. How are you, my boy? Come here, my love. Mommy is very tired. Mommy is very tired. Did you eat your food? Did you eat your food? When did you get in? Not long ago. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to disturb you. -Come on. -Cem! Stop that, or else. Or else what? -I'll kill you. -Would you? Wait. Be careful. And don't forget my socks. Mother sent you lunch. OK, put it over there. I'll take the dishes back. She wants some filo pastry. I'll buy some bread on my way back. It smells great. How do you make it like this? I've tried so many times, but it never turns out like this. Like this. Let's say I have a natural talent. I'm hungry. Come on, feed me. -Open some wine, then. -Alright. Shall we have raki instead? Pomerol. What's the plan for tomorrow night? We'll be at the office. Come to the office and we'll go from there. -OK. Who else is coming? -The whole team. -Hi. -Hi. -Hello, everyone! -Hi, how are you? Good, how are you? What do you think about this slide, Cem? -It's at the heart of our project. -Exactly! Let's stretch this out a bit. Let's separate these. -What's up? -Hey, how are you? -Good, and you? -Fine, thanks. Nezahat's son, that loser. -Foxy Hüseyin? -Yes. Every day he asks his mother for money. -Me too, I've given him some money. -What? He'll never give it back. I know. And his wife is four months pregnant. Didn't you know that? How should I know? I'm not counting Huseyin's children. He is a tramp living like a king. My goodness! Go and get the pie, my dear. And bring us some tea, as well. "Go get the pie, go get the tea!" Go to hell! The cheese that she bought wasn't good. Why do you send Elmas to buy cheese? Just tell me and I can get it for you. -How is she supposed to learn? -She will. She's still young. Just tell me, and I'll get you whatever you need. Don't send her! -I'll take it. -This is Mom's. Elmas! Haven't you finished yet? Almost done, Mother. Hurry up! Don't make your husband wait! Just let me finish. Finish it tomorrow. Just come here now. You have to give me an injection! Your hands are cold. Please, God. Don't let him come. -Where is Cem? -He's getting a drink over there. How are you? -I'm fine. -Hello. How are you? -Where is your girlfriend? -Which girlfriend? Incredible things have happened... This is not over. Add some coal in the stove. Perform your ablutions. -Come on. -Alright. Elmas! Elmas. What are you doing over there? Hey! Elmas. Elmas. Look at me! Hey, did you fall asleep over there? Elmas. Don't freak me out! Are you messing with me? -Mom, come here. -What is it? Elmas isn't responding. The person inside is dead. Report it immediately. Ask for an ambulance. 64-55 to HQ. Ambulance required. We have a body here. Don't touch the door. -Did you open it? -Alright. What are you doing here? What is your name? -Come on. -Come to our house, Elmas. Come on. Easy. Over here! 18 year old female. Blood pressure 90-60, heart rate 60, temperature 35. Come on, hurry up! One, two, three! Nurse, check her vitals! -What's her name? -Elmas Karaali. Elmas! -Can you hear me? -Her temperature is 35. What's the situation? Her pulse is 65, temperature is 35. She has hypothermia. Blood and urine samples could not be taken. Elmas. Your name is Elmas, right? -Where is Dr Şehnaz? -She has been told. She's on her way. Elmas, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. Look, I don't have a syringe. The nurse and I will just take your blood pressure and your temperature. You won't feel any pain. Just stay calm. I'm here. They briefed me in the emergency room. What's happening? First, I'll need to perform a gynaecological examination. They'll ask you questions too. It's a criminal case. First, she needs to calm down. It's not easy to get through to her. -What's her name? -Elmas. Hello, Elmas. I'm Şehnaz Ateş Bilgin. I'm a psychiatrist. Apparently you've had a hard time. But you're safe now. No one is going to hurt you here, OK? Now, will you let the nurse take your blood pressure? Nurse... Stay calm. Let us know if it hurts. -You won't feel any pain. -Everything's going to be fine. Tell us if it hurts and the nurse will stop. Can you tell me how you got these bruises? On your arm. Let's take the blood pressure first. Elmas? Please sit down wherever you like. Something bad happened at home, Elmas. Would you like to tell me about it? How did it happen? Do you want to tell me? Do you want to go to the restroom? I'll come with you. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. There is something here... It attracts me a lot, but I don't know exactly what it is. This place always takes me back to my childhood. What do you think about Elmas' condition? Elmas' condition... I didn't see any injuries, other than those bruises. What about the internal tears? They're fresh. Probably from last night. When will we get her husband's autopsy report? I've sent the samples in, but it takes a couple of months for the results to come. You're optimistic! I mean... It was carbon monoxide poisoning. -Really? -I think so. You lost your husband, and your mother-in-law. Don't be afraid. It's normal to not remember. It's normal to feel confused. The mind can play games on you after something tragic has happened. Don't be afraid. You're safe here. I am here to help you. Would you like to tell me about yourself? What does your father do, Elmas? Alright. How long have you been married? Two. -Two. -Two? Two. -Two years or two months? -Years. Alright... Did your husband look after you? -How about your sex life? -I can't talk about that. -That would be a sin. -Alright. It's OK. Do you know where your parents are? Are you still in touch? Do they know that you're here? Would you like them to come? Do you want to see them? Would you like them to come? Just my mother. Not my father. No, I don't want my mother, either. This smells a lot better. Are you back? No, it's not me. I'm not here. What time is it? Almost two. I called you, but you didn't answer. I called you, but you didn't answer. I put the phone on silent, and forgot about it. You forgot? Are you telling me that you forgot? -Can this really be you? -I told you it's not me. Come on, let's go to bed. Come here. Jump. Are you going to give a statement? Elmas? We found the keys in your pocket. Why did you go out on to the balcony that night? Did your husband mistreat you? Did you administer your mother-in-law's insulin? That's what your neighbours tell us. We found your fingerprints on the syringe. Yes, I do it. -Did you give her an injection that day? -Yes... No. I didn't. Who locked you out on the balcony? Didn't you hear anything while your husband was dying? He says, “Mom, I feel cranky.” What does that mean? Doctor, your patient is in a critical condition. She's been acting strange since the prosecutor questioned her. Then she began to scream. She's hurting herself. Her mother is here, asking about her. Prosecutor? Let's see what's going on. Elmas, calm down. Calm down, my dear. Calm down. It's alright. Everyone go out now. You can go. Elmas? Elmas. Elmas. Can you hear me? Everything's fine. Can you hear me? It's OK. I want you to breathe normally, OK? Hold it in... Hold it. Now exhale slowly. Good. Once more. Come on. Hold it. Breathe out. Why did that man come here? Why did he ask me about her? What did I do wrong? I folded the sheets neatly! Just like this! I cleaned everywhere! I folded the sheets so neatly! She smells bad. She smells so bad. Both of them smell very bad. She never gave me any money. So I couldn't do anything. She gets annoyed. She casts spells on me. Here you go. Your mother is here. Would you like to see her? This is my own little paradise. Each morning I jump into the water. -Summer or winter. -Where? From here? Of course not. Of course not. From there. Isn't it possible that Elmas went to her mother-in-law that day? Do you believe that? The evidence is against her. But it's also possible that the mother-in-law panicked and overdosed herself. The rest is straightforward. Sometimes Elmas seems so young to me. Like a child. -Who's that in the photo? -My mother. -She's a beautiful woman. -Thanks. Where is she now? She passed away. How did she die? From grief. What do you mean by grief? She used to sit over there... ...and wait for my father. My father was a captain. Always at sea. She used to stand there... ...and wait. One of your eyes... ...is clear. The other eye... ...is obscure. When you look at them both together... I don't know. It's strange. You're a strange man. Like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde? Exactly! When the weather is like this, I grill some anchovies first. Then I grill my lovers and then I bury them in the cellar. What's that in your hand, Elmas? What have you got there? What do you see? An eye. Why is it in your hand? It fell out. Whose eye is it? It's my eye. Mine. Come on, stand up now. Now act out your dream. OK, Elmas? Let me explain. You will choose some objects from here. Alright? You'll give a role to each of them and make them talk. You're going to do it. I'll help you. Alright? Like when we were kids. We used to do role-playing with our friends. You'll do something similar now and I'll help you. Where were you in your dream? -In the village, at home. -I see. Take a look around. Pick an object. Imagine this is your house in the village. Can you imagine that? Look around and think of the house. What did it look like? What would you like to choose? What were you doing in your dream? We were running. We were running and running. We went up the stairs. Who was there? Me. Pick an object for yourself then. Take a look at the objects. Put that one on the table. -You said “We were running”, right? -Yes. So there was someone else with you. A little girl. Pick an object for her, too, then. She must be red. Red? Why red? -Because her dress was red. -I see. Do you know this girl? Who is she? My sister. We were wrestling. Then we fell, we got muddy, we were cold and ran into the house. We ran and ran and ran. What did you see over there? What was over there, Elmas? What did you see? Is there anything there? It seems like you can see something. -My mother is there. -Your mother? Choose your mother then. Come on, choose her. This is my mother. So, what does she look like? A thorn. Like a thorn. And then, what happened with your mother? My mom took my sister, and they walked to the door. I put my coat on. My mother said we were leaving. Then my mother pointed at something. What was that? A blanket. What kind of blanket? What colour? What did it look like? It was a horrible blanket. Faded. Gray. Then choose that, too. What are you doing with the blanket? I am lying on it. Come on then, lie down. Come on, lie down for a bit. Close your eyes. What's making you cry, Elmas? Why are you crying? Who is making you cry? My mother. Your mother. What did your mother do to you? I'm dead. I'm dead. She said "You're dead." Mom said “You're dead.” She said... She said to me, “You're going to sleep here.” How did you end up here? I did everything. I did everything she told me to do. I tidied the house every morning. I folded the sheets very neatly. Every morning. My father wouldn't look at me. I must have done something sinful. I've always thought I was very stupid. Why else would they send me away? Why else would they do it? How did you end up here, Elmas? How did you end up on this blanket? I was 13 years old. I'd just come back from school. And I was feeling very cold. My feet were covered in mud. I ran home and sat next to the stove. I wanted to warm up. My mother was preparing beans. She told me to stay by the stove. She told me that I wouldn't be going to school anymore. “No more school for you.” she said. This was what she and my father had decided. They thought I should get married. She said there was a good match for me. She said I won't have any trouble with him. She kept on preparing the bean dish. She didn't look at me even once. She went on and on with the beans. She didn't look at me. Not even once. Come over here. Get up. Which object did you choose to be your mother? Pick it up. Put it on a chair. Now take Elmas too. Place that too. Now stand behind Elmas. Stand behind the chair. This is Elmas. And this is her mother. Now let Elmas talk. Make her say something. What does she have to say? Look at Elmas' mother. She is looking at Elmas now. What would Elmas like to say? Pour your heart out. Make Elmas talk. -What does she want to say to her? -Mom... Mom... Why did you let me go? Speak! Stand behind her. Now go and stand behind her mother. Let Elmas' mother speak. What is she saying? Elmas wants her mother to speak. What does her mother say? Come over here. Pour your heart out some more. Mom! Why didn't you say anything? Why did you send me away? How could you sleep that night? Speak! Speak to me! Come over here now. Let Elmas' mother speak. Come on. Do you think Elmas' mother is also crying? Is she also crying? What would she like to say to her daughter? Elmas... Elmas. Mom. Can I come back? Of course, my dear. Come back. Mother, can I come back? Come back, my daughter. What else would you do? Come back. Mother... My father... What about him? What will he say? What can he say? He can't say anything. You come back. He won't say a thing. Mother... Don't you dare... Not to my sister! Never! Are you looking after my sister? Take good care of her! Don't you dare! Are you looking after her? Don't worry, my dear. Your sister... It won't happen to your sister. Don't worry. You can be sure about that. Mother... What do you think? It's incredible! -So wonderful! -It's beautiful, isn't it? So beautiful. -The weather changed so quickly. -Yes. I think it changed for you. That's it! Hello, Cem. There was a storm last night, The power was cut. I'm telling you, there was a storm! I have to go to the hospital now. Can we talk later? I'll call you on Skype tonight. OK. How old are you, Elmas? 18. The report I have here says you're younger than that. Tell me, what should I believe? Is the date on your ID false? Elmas. It will help a lot if you're underage. -That's not the case. -It is, Elmas. I mean it's not the date of birth. When were you born? When was it changed? Come on, tell me. Don't be afraid. -I can't. -Why not? I took an oath. So you were made not to say anything? Who made you swear? My father. So, your date of birth was changed at some point. Was it changed before your marriage? Is this what happened? How did it happen? Who did it? My father. How? I was taken to the court. What happened there? Do you remember? What did they ask? How did you answer? -Look, I didn't lie. -You didn't. -I didn't do anything wrong. -Yes. I don't want to go to court again. -I just want to get out of here! -You won't go to court. -I didn't lie! -You didn't. You won't have to go to court again. -I won't. -That's right. You haven't done anything wrong. -I haven't. -Alright. Don't be afraid. Now tell me about your marriage. What should I say? What was your husband like? Did he treat you well? How did you feel? Suffocated. The walls... The walls were closing in on me. I couldn't breathe. I prayed to God every day so he wouldn't come home. I began to smell bad as well. I was bleeding from down below. Bleeding and bleeding... Give that to me. Let's put that clock back. Tell me about that night. Look, I don't know anything. I don't remember anything. -Tell me what you remember. -For God's sake, stop asking me! There was a storm that night. Do you remember the storm? Do you remember the storm. -There was a storm... -Yes. There was a storm. What did you see, Elmas? Tell me. It's cold. Tell me what you see, Elmas. What do you see? He came... He grabbed my arms with his claws. I managed to get up. -Where did you go? -To the stove. I'm going to the stove. My back hurts. My back... Coal... I'm going to the bathroom... To perform my ablutions. What did you see over there, Elmas? He is looking at me. He's all red. -I'm scared. -Who is this, Elmas? -It's him. He's there. -Is it your husband? I am scared that he would grab me again. I ran. Forgive me, God. Please forgive me, God! I ran to the balcony. -Forgive me, God, forgive me! -Calm down. -Forgive me, God, forgive me! -Calm down. The risotto is ready. Are you coming? OK. I'm coming. Stop it! That's enough! -Stop what? -This game! -You're the one playing games. -I'm not. You tried to fool me with that storm thing! What are you talking about? What storm? Don't come any closer. It's finished. It's over. It's over. The time has come. OK? Did you hear me? -Do you understand? -You disappoint me. -You've no difference! -Is this only your disappointment? What am I supposed to do? You want me to be your whore? Or your slave? -You're talking nonsense! -The world doesn't revolve around you! So you found a new orbit? You're doing it again! What do you want me to do? -When will you really love me? -Don't put that on me. -Don't tell me I don't love you! -I wish you could love me. I wish you could love me as much as you love yourself. Fuck off, Şehnaz! Get the hell out of here before I lose it! I was going to leave anyway. Just leave me alone! You're not going anywhere. Neither you, nor me. Nobody gets out of that door. Let me go! I hate you! -Come on then. -You can't hit me! What did I say? -I said “You're staying!” -No, I won't. -You aren't going anywhere. -No, I won't. -I won't stay! -Yes, you will! I won't stay!
