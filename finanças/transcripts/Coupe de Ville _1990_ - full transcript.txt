O.K., let's go. Come on, Marvin, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Look, here comes the professor. Looks like he wants to talk to you. It's the pedal on the right. Push it down and go! We zoom! Let's go, Marvin. Marvin, I think the joke's over. I get it. You're joking with me, right? You are going to go any second, right? I love this-- Marvin with a sense of humor. I always thought you're, like, the Bob Hope of the family. You say something, Libner? Suck me off! Suck me off! Allergies. We've spent a lot of time together, haven't we? Yes, sir, we... Suck me off! Do you have a cat? You're a funny boy, aren't you, Libner? Well, you know, I believe that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I think Kennedy said that. I've got a feeling that you'll have me in stitches all next year, my friend. Can we go now, Marvin? Have a nice summer. Thank you. You, too. Rest up. O.K. Say hello to your wife. Suck me off! Fidel Castro. Let me tell you something about Fidel Castro. Sorry to tell you, he's not a real man. Fred! If he was here, would he bait a fishhook with his hands? I think no. You're saying Castro's-- I let the facts speak for themselves. Watch your line. You're drifting. Hello, Fred. Boys, are we having any luck? I'd do better if I threw my pole in the water. Marvin's on the phone, sweetie. Yeah? Marvin? Long-distance? He's calling collect. What else is new? Watch my pole, Marty. Why is he calling in on a Wednesday? He never calls on a Wednesday. How do I know? Think I know something you don't? Why is everything my responsibility? Ask him to come and visit. I miss my boy. I can't get her off of me. Marvin, are you there? Hey, hi! Hi, Pop. Hi, how are you? Fine. Tell me about the car. How's Mom? Fine. Tell me about the car. It's beautiful, Pop. It's just perfect. Make sure it stays that way. That's your mother's car. That's a gift for your precious jewel of a mother. You want a sandwich? I'm on long-distance, for Christ's sakes! Marvin, are you there? Buddy, get the can off the hood! What's a can on the hood for? Let me talk to dad. You there? Yeah, I'm here, Pop. No screw-ups, Marvin. Right, Pop. What? I said right. Never mind. I want you and your brothers here Sunday without a scratch on you. The you-know-what better be in the same condition. Wow, look at that. Isn't that something? Fill it up, I guess. That's neat. Honey, you want one? What's that? Tuna fish. I'm fishing, and you're making tuna fish sandwiches. Jesus Christ almighty. Marvin, let me talk to dad. Hi, Dad! Who's that? It's Buddy! I was talking to Marvin. If I want to talk to you, I'll tell Marvin to put you on! Put Marvin back on! Marvin. Yeah. Hi, Pop. Marvin, are you there? I'm here. Put Buddy on. Hey, Buddy! Hi. Buddy again. I'll say this only once, so listen carefully. Your brother Marvin is in charge, not you. Is that clear? Tell him. Marvin, Dad says you're in charge. Did you tell him? Yeah. Good. Now put Bobby on. Bobby, you're up. I don't want to talk to him. Bobby? Hey, Pop. How ya doin'? I'm fine. Christ almighty. Sorry, Dad. I'll tell you this once, so listen very, very carefully. Your mother loves you very much, maybe the most. I think you'll be in the penitentiary within the year, but what do I know? Your mother loves you, so for her sake, do not screw this up! Yeah, Pop.

Marvin, there's something I want to ask you. So ask. You're going to go back, work for dad, right? Yeah. So? Well... Why? What's the matter with that? Nothing. It's just... It's Dad. So? What exactly will you do down there? I don't know, but he said he's working on something big. Like the two-sided fishing rod with the reel in the middle? Stupid idea. It's not a stupid idea. It's a business! Work, responsibility. Don't these words mean anything to you? Duh. Shut up. Let me eat. Eat. My God, we have movement! Ladies and gentlemen, the fork has officially left the plate. It's down now. I'll pay. We'll split it three ways down the middle. I had two cheeseburgers, 90 cents-- I'm paying. Not necessary. I said I'd pay! I'll pay my own way. Yeah? Since when?

Stop looking at your watch. I got to be at the track for the daily double. God forbid you shouldn't feed the greyhounds. I don't need you to tell me how to live. How could a person spend an entire lifetime in a place like this? What are you, a bat? I got a brother who's a bat. This is the project I'm working on for Marvin. I remember this project. Thomas Edison. I almost made a bundle on that. Why didn't you? If you're going to criticize, take off! All right! Show me what you made for Marvin. Looks like a stop sign, Fred. It is a stop sign. I got to go, Fred. Nice talking to you. Touch it. What for? It's a stop sign. You made my nephew a stop sign. I'll go before I say something upsetting, like you're a putz. Touch it! Knock it. Smell it. All right? Knock it. I'm not knocking it, I'm not smelling it. Jesus Christ. All right! Here. So? Feels like wood, right? It feels like wood. When I knocked it, it felt like wood. It's not. It's polyurethane. It's plastic. Why? It's the stop sign of tomorrow! What's wrong with the stop sign of today? I got to go. Really. It's an annuity for my kids, for all three of them. It's a legacy. It floats. It won't rust. It'll last forever. So it's, it's like a legacy. I... I didn't look at it that way... but-- Hey, I can see what you're talking about. It's... it's a good legacy. A floating stop sign. I like it. it's something I'm fooling around with. Maybe Marvin could manufacture it and make something of himself. Come to the track with me. Big shot. I got work to do. You could use some sun. I'm not a gambler. No? Exhibit "A." Take off if you're going to take off. I was trying to be nice. You didn't call me a putz? I had the urge to, but I didn't! There's a big difference. Goodbye. Goodbye. I like your sign. What do you know about signs? Putz! Schmuck! I don't get this. What? This trip. Turn that up. Even for Pop. What? He bought mom a car. We're delivering the car. That's what I don't get. You're too young to remember. Are we speaking to us? We had a car like this once. Yeah, right. A Caddy. Yeah, a '54 Caddy. Remember? Dad pulled up in it. It had a big bow on it. A big red bow! The interior was very similar to this. It was almost exactly the same as this. God, that was a hell of a car. Only had it for a couple of days. Pop was really sorry he gave it up 'cause mom loved that car. It was the same blue as this. Now he bought another '54. What a romantic son of a gun. Damn. But why drive a 9-year-old car from Detroit to Miami? I mean why are we doing this? The old man works in mysterious ways. My God. What? I figured it out. What? This is it! This is our old car! Holy shit! You're right. I bet you're right! The old man tracked it down! I don't know how he did it, but he did it! I can't-- That son of a gun! I'm right, aren't I? You're right! My God, this is incredible. God! Cool! My God. Amazing! You were right! God, help me! What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. You going to throw up? Don't throw up in the car, Buddy! I bet the diner food made you sick. You had the Spanish omelet, right? It looked greasy. That burger wasn't any good, either. Would you shut up, Bobby! If he said he won't throw up, he won't. I'm going to throw up. No! That is a negative! Do not throw up in this car! Don't panic. Pull the car over. We're on a bridge! Barf out the back! Not out the back! It'll blow back in! Show a little compassion. You'd be in the same boat if you'd eaten that greasy omelet. Bobby, goddamn it! It was just grease. It was like grease on the grease. Shut up! Swallow! Gulp in the air! Just swallow! Keep swallowing, O.K..? Swallow! Is that helping? Good! I thought you'd outgrown this a long time ago. Does that really work? Yeah. Because you're swallowing your own throw up, you know that? Buddy, don't listen to him! Buddy? Aah! Aah! You see that? I knew it was the omelet. Shut up! What? ♪ And the rockets' red glare ♪ Feeling better? A little. Want some? ♪ Through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ Is that a no? ♪ Banner-- ♪ Hey, Buddy! Shut the door! Don't flush-- Jesus Christ! You don't flush the toilet when someone's showering! You gave me third-degree burns on my back! Sorry, Marvin. I was vomiting. The Fugitive. O.K. Hey, turn on the game! What game? I'm watching The Fugitive. What are you talking about? Koufax is pitching. You packed a bathrobe? Excuse me, General. I'm watching a program here. This is the best left-hander who ever lived. Can you believe this? Actually, Bobby, I'd like to watch the baseball game. Really? What's the matter? Since when are you such a baseball fan? Always. It's gang up on the kid brother. I'm not ganging up on anybody. You never watched baseball at home. How could I? If you weren't glued to Howdy Doody, it was Crusader Rabbit. Be quiet. He's pitching a shutout here. I'm watching The Fugitive. You're not watching The Fugitive. I'm in charge. I'm the leader. You're the leader of the TV? Yeah. The kid can't vote? We voted. It was 2-1. You lost. Right, Buddy? Marvin, I don't want to watch the game because you're in charge. I want to watch because I want to. It's my own feeling, I mean, if that's possible! What, you don't think I recognize your feelings? You think I can't feel? Screw you! And screw you, too! Our leader. Got 5 miles till the interstate. You want the radio on? No, thanks. Bob? Bobby? What? Want the radio on? No. Pretty hot chick? Yeah, she's great, Marvin. You still like to look at the girls, don't ya? Or does this Tammy have you too whipped? I still look. How 'bout you, Bobby? I bet you have some good times with the ladies? Hey, look, Marvin, you're a tight-ass. You know that, we know that, so there's no point in trying to make us think any different. You think I'm a tight-ass? I know you're a tight-ass. Everybody knows you're a tight-ass. Why don't you turn around. I'm afraid I might catch it. Hi. We going a little fast there, Marvin? The faster we get to Florida, the better. A hundred bucks? Easy. Shit! What? Shit, the cops! You messed up, Marvin. Damn it! Marvin, pull over. Marvin. Would you pull over? Marvin! Sheez! No! Aah! Aah! Shit! Look at this! The goddamn headlight's busted. Jesus Christ! The whole front end is screwed up! Goddamn it! If you hadn't been such a shit, this never would've happened. Marvin, it's not my fault. Guys, please. Don't start fighting again. Are you going to throw up again? We can get this fixed in Palm Beach. Maybe 60 bucks. 60 bucks? It's going to cost more than 60 bucks! Who's in charge here? He is! He is! You driving, Sergeant? Yes. Yes, I was. Any idea how fast you were going? I was... 50? Look, I'm just... I'm just upset that-- You mind stepping back to the squad car with us, Sergeant? Yeah. O.K. You guys wait here. O.K. We were going to take in a show-- Shut up! Your license, Sergeant. What do you think's going to happen? Marvin's going to get the chair. You're in a real big hurry, ain't you, Sergeant? Yeah. I'm trying to get down to Florida. Get rid of my two little brothers there. I know how you feel. I got three brothers. Make me sick to be around them. Always yak, yak, yak, yak. You know how it is, then. As a matter of fact, you remind me of my oldest brother, the one I really can't stand. I hope Marvin doesn't lose his temper with these guys. I'll go talk to the boys here. So? Is there a fine? Yes. There's a fine. How much? How much you got, both of you? I got... I got 115 bucks, total. That's not enough? They want 250! What did you say, yes? What do you want me to say, genius? It's either that or a week in jail. It's an awful lot for a speeding ticket. We're not buying a painting. You don't haggle. They're cops. These are Southern cops! We're in the middle of goddamn Klan country. O.K. First of all, this isn't Klan country. These are decent, hard-working people. Buddy! I don't have time for this now! Give me your money. I got 40 bucks. That's it. I'm busted. Buddy. Buddy! All right, Marvin. I've got $100. This is probably a bad time to mention it, but I need this money to buy Tammy an engagement ring. Sorry. You got to give me the money. We're broke. Marvin, you're going to have to call dad. You want some fruit? It's good for you. If I liked it and it was bad for me, I would eat it-- If I liked it, which I don't. You got a nectarine? I got it. Hello. I have a collect call for anyone from Marvin Libner. All you had to say was Marvin Libner. The collect part I could have told you. Hey, Pop! What's wrong with the car? Nothing! Hey! Marvin, is there a problem with the car? No. Not a problem. Then what the hell are you calling me for? Um... Yeah. The... the car. What--what kind of gas does it take? You're calling me long-distance collect to ask me what kind of gas it takes? High-test, you jerk! Get off the phone before I bust a blood vessel. O.K., Pop. See you soon. Buddy? Buddy? Hi. You awake? No. I can't sleep. Do the thing with the sheep. Thank you, Marvin. I'll give it a try. Come on, Buddy. Let's talk. We can talk about you and Tammy. Yeah. O.K. Does she put out? None of your business. Come on. Forget it. When was it you got her, first date? Second? Third? Will you guys shut up? I'm trying to sleep. Let's talk about the first date. I don't want to talk about it. Which date? Get some sleep, Bobby. That's all I want to know. Did you take her to dinner? The movies. Have a good time? It was great. We saw Splendor in the Grass. Did you buy her candy? Sure. Did you feel her up? Bobby. You did, didn't you? Under or over? Good night, Bobby. Under! I knew it. Bobby. What? Tammy isn't the kind of woman you think she is. So you didn't do the deed? This isn't the sort of thing adults talk about. Please. Yes, we did. Good for you, Buddy. Look, you know, I know this isn't easy for you. This is all I got. Do what you think you should do. O.K. Buddy, you ready? What are you doing? All this time you were holding out on me? Marvin! I'm sleeping in a field? I'm giving it to you now. You held out on me. I'm giving it to you now. What else you holding out? What's this? Marvin-- What is this? It's a coin collection. Give me my bag. I didn't know you still had these. Marvin! You fink! That's it, Marvin. I'm going back to Detroit. Get the hell out of here, Robert. Thank you, Marvin. Don't tell me where I go. You don't tell me shit, understand? Cut out the Robert crap. You're not Pop. You just think you are. Goddamn it, Buddy. What'd I do? Bobby, get in the car. I don't have time for this. Hate me after we deliver the car. Don't tell me when to hate you, Marvin. I hate you all the fuckin' time. I could give a shit! Maybe if you gave a shit, I wouldn't hate ya! All right, fine. Blow. Beat it, you little runt. You wanna run, run! You want to beat me up again? I didn't beat you up. Marvin, this is stupid. He can't go. I don't have time for this crap. Marvin, may I say something? Your whole approach here is not good. Please. Look, Bobby-- I'm not letting him tell me what to do. You can't just leave, off in the middle of nowhere. I'll hitch a ride. He's not my father. He's not my brother. I don't know him! He's not your brother? No! Remember when you broke your arm? I never broke my arm! I broke my leg. The point is, Marvin carried you home. You were crying, and he carried you home 12 blocks. Right. He had to. If he'd left me, Dad would've killed him. Bobby... I know how you feel. See, Marvin resents you. You're the youngest and were always the wildest. He wishes he were the wildest. Right. You don't think he's wild? Marvin's calm? Marvin's a friggin' lunatic, Buddy! He loves you. Buddy, you don't know what you're talking about. You don't know me any better than he does, so screw off! Get in that car, you little punk! Get in there before I rip your ear off! O.K., Marvin? Everything's cleared up. O.K. Let me just-- After Sunday, we never have to see each other again. Marvin, you go off and work with Dad, I'll go off and marry Tammy, and, Bobby, you'll go back to school and hopefully grow up a little. We never have to say another word to each other for as long as we live. O.K.? O.K. Now I think we should get going. Fred? I don't know what you did, but you broke the steering cable. What? You snapped the steering cable. I hit a log. So what? Fix it like you always do. Get behind the wheel and turn it when I tell you... my little genius. Will this take long? I got a tag sale at 4:00. You got the doctor, and you know it. I'm not going. Turn the wheel to the right. I'm up to here with the tests. You're going, so don't start. Turn the wheel again. I don't want to see another hospital again. They'll kill me with the injections and poking. Turn around, genius. I want to see your face. Why? You're a handsome man. You know that? I always thought so, too. I could have done better by you, Betty. Damn right. You could have. But, hey, you take the cards you get dealt. I don't regret marrying you for a minute, despite the fact my mother told me not to. That's a lot of crap. Your mother loved me from the first date. She thought you were cocky. We were late. I didn't want to walk up the steps, so I beeped the horn. Who would've thought on the next date you would propose? Hold on. Wait a minute. You proposed. I never said anything. You most certainly did. Nope. We were on a double date with Melvyn and Geraldine-- No, no, no. You got down on your knees. As God is my witness, I never proposed. I got on my knees to find my cigarettes. I wanted your help, so I said, "Betty, would you--?" You were all over me, telling Mel and Geraldine we were engaged. Why do you think I quit smoking? Jesus. Come on. Let's get washed up.

He fell asleep. That's all. We can fix it. No. That's it. It's over. Look, we can fix it, Marvin. With what? We're broke. We'll find a way. Don't you get it? It's over! Marvin, what is the big deal? It's a car. It's just a car. It's not the car. It's not about the car. What is it about, Marvin? It's Pop. Pop? What? What is it about Pop? God. He's going to die. That's it, isn't it? Well, can't they operate or something? No. Are they going to give him any medicine? No. How long have you known, Marvin? He made me promise-- How long have you known, Marvin? A week? A month? Two months? He didn't want you to know! Neither did you. He didn't want us to know he was dying? You should've told us! I know! I--I should have told you. I couldn't. I wanted to. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Come on, Marvin. Tammy lives around here? Yeah, somewhere around here. She must be rich. Let's ask her for the money. Let's get to her house. Then we'll see. Sure you know where you're going? It's got to be around here somewhere. You said she was rich. Shh! Buddy. Surprise, surprise! What are you doing here? I came with my brothers. That's my baby brother Bobby with the glasses, and that's my big brother Marvin. I missed you so much. Buddy. You shouldn't have come. What--What's wrong? Tammy, I'm going to the store. I'll be right back. His name's Rick. Buddy, I'm sorry. Tammy, don't do this. I just-- I never thought I'd see you again. You can't do this. Everything's all planned. Buddy. I brought you the final versions of the ranch house. Buddy, don't. I used your suggestions. Can I talk to you for a minute? She can't do this. Come here. Let's talk. No. She's going to be-- We had it all set! You know, it's funny. I feel as if I know you. Why are you doing this? Buddy's told us so many wonderful things about you. Calm down, O.K.? We're in kind of a jam here. We need to fix this car. We're broke. I hate to ask-- No! Don't ask her! Don't ask her for a stinking dime! I got to go. Tammy, please! Bud. Buddy. Get off. Terrific seeing you kids together. The car's in the driveway, but I got to tell you something. You want me to see it, I'll see it. I wish Pop was more like you. Then he'd be here all the time. Don't lose your sense of humor. It's terrific what your father's doing for your mother. What's with him? Girl trouble. What he do, swallow one? Before you go out, can I talk to you? Yeah, yeah, yeah! What are you worried about? He'll go look at the car. He'll... see a little damage. He'll come back in, give us the money. That'll be that. Right? Sure. Absolutely. All right. First we set you up with new identities, probably in a foreign country. You'll need passports, driver's licenses, and weapons. You'll need weapons in case he tracks you down. Moe, Larry, and Curly... the three jabonies. Uncle Phil, can you lend us the money? We don't need a lot, like, 600 or 700 bucks. I want your mother to have that car. You got to get it fixed. It'd be my pleasure to give you the money. But, um... see, my cash flow-- Well... right now it's not... flowing so well, if you get my drift. If you came last week or next week-- We can't wait another week. Blew your money on the dogs? I made an investment that didn't pay off. Four jabonies. You got that right. It gets back to your father, I'll kill you. You live here, you don't have 500 bucks to lend us? You got any ideas? We're falling apart here. Got any money between you? Your coin collection. What's that worth? $90. All right. I'll let you in on something. This friend of mine, Foxy Birnbaum gave me a very, very, very, very hot tip. On a dog. No, on a buffalo. It's a dog track. What do you think? This guy with the tip-- He's reliable? Yeah, he's reliable. They call him Foxy. Look, Foxy says it's a definite can-do. Here are the official entries for the fifth race. Running 5/16 of a mile... number 1, Flyboy, 67. 6-7. Number 2, Donna's Delight, 77 1/2. 7-7 1/2. Number 3, Impossible Dream-- What are those numbers? Those are the odds. Tells you what you get if you win. I know what odds are, Marvin. I've been to the track before. Yeah. Yeah. Number 5, Cindy Mist. 77 1/2. Which one of these dogs is the hot tip? Number 6, Silver Stu. Number 6, Silver Stu. 79. 7-9. All right, let's place the bet. Yeah? Hey, you! Yeah. We'd like to bet on that one there. It's better if you go up to the betting window.

This Flyboy looks good. Don't screw around. Make the bet we agreed on. He's never been in the money. We're putting all our money on a dog that's never won a race? That's why he's the long shot. Flyboy is a winner. Look at the last finishes. He's first, first, third, second, second. You want to buy a pack of Lucky's, bet on Flyboy. You want to fix the car, bet on Silver Stu. He's never even won a race. You're making a mistake. All right! Do it your way. 90 bucks. Are you really serious about this...Rick? Buddy, I don't know. I don't know anything right now. I know. I know I love you. You loved me at college. That's a different world. You don't know me well enough to love me. I think we should go to bed. What? Right now. It's only fair. Buddy, I don't believe you. Listen, Tammy. O.K.? Just listen to me. I'm 22 years old. I'll probably live to be 90. That's...68 years. 68 years I'd have to live without you. It's too long. I can't do it. Remember the last time we made love? Yes. It was great. Nah, it wasn't great. I fell asleep the minute it was over. I was tired, sure. But if I had known it was the last time, I would have been much more attentive, believe me. I didn't mind that you fell asleep. If you didn't mind, you wouldn't be leaving me. ♪ Baby, baby ♪ ♪ Baby, baby ♪ One minute till post time, ladies and gentlemen. One minute. ♪ Aha ♪ ♪ Puerto rice ♪ I did what I thought was best.

I get it. Rick, stop it! Doesn't he know the meaning of surrender? Stop it! Rick. Candy-ass college boy. Buddy? Are you O.K.? Here's a guy. He's advertising a ton of vintage caddy parts. His name is James B. Hillenbrand III. Thurston Road. How about this? "Doc Sturgeon, the Cadillac Surgeon. "Body work and paint jobs "Done lightning fast and dirt cheap. Proof of ownership not always necessary." Now we're cooking. Hey, Buddy boy! Check it out. What's the matter with you? We had sex. Good. Buddy? Buddy, come on. Buddy. Aw! Bud. What happened, Buddy? Yeah... I met Rick. You had a fight? I didn't have a fight. He had a fight. I think he won. This hurt? Aah! Let's go get him. Clean him up and call it a night. We're not going! We don't even know what happened. We had sex. What can I do for you? Come on, you son of a bitch! Come on! You touch my brother again, I'll kill you! What the hell are you doing? Working on my sign. I'm worried sick. I can't go for a walk? You couldn't wake me? You scared the living hell out of me. I didn't want to worry you. You walked? If you woke up, you'd need the car to find me, so I walked. Let's go home, sweetie. It works. What works? The sign works. I stopped. 100 years from now when they excavate, it's still going to be there. Perfect. No rust. You make any coffee? Yeah, I made a pot before I went hysterical. You don't mind my asking? It's all right that I ask? Let's go! We got a big day ahead! Come on, move out! Back off, Marvin! No time, boy! Let's go! Come on! Hop to! Every inch of my body is on fire. Be sore tomorrow, Buddy. We got a car to fix today. For one fleeting moment at the track last night, I thought maybe, just maybe, I was wrong about you. For a second, I even started to like you. Then you let that guy beat up Buddy, don't do shit about it. I'm just letting you know I feel nothing for you, Marvin. You just dissolved. You're not even a person. It's going to be a big job. It's got structural damage. You got to paint the whole thing, top to bottom. You've got a very sick girl here. But we got money. That's good, son, because money is a key factor here. You going to fix this car, Dad? Billy, go away. I'm busy here. The car, she's in a state of shock. She's a wounded beauty. I've got to work fast. We want you to work fast. I've got to be gentle, like in Bambi. Pardon me? Bambi. Remember? All the little woods people, they thought she was dead. Yeah? She wasn't. Just in shock. They had to be very gentle with little Bambi, they did. The car's in shock? You bet she is. It's got to look brand-new. Of course it does. Believe me, I know just how you feel. Dad, can I help you fix the car? Billy, I told you I'm working. Now, scat. Go on. Bambi's mom, she's the one that got killed, right? That's correct. Thumper. No, no. Thumper was a bunny. Right! The little bunny. He'd stomp his foot. Hi, Billy. Hi. My name's Bobby. Doesn't feel too good getting yelled at, does it? No. It's got to be done by noon tomorrow. Get out of here. No, no. See, it's our last chance. If it's not tomorrow, it's nothing. Then it's nothing, because I can't do it. You collect coins, Billy? I have pennies in my drawer. See this coin here? It was made in 1917. Not many like it in America. You a coin collector? Yeah...I was. This is my last coin. I want you to have it. There's no time. We'll help, the three of us. Done any body work lately, have you, son? No. Right. It's a really very special coin. There you go. Thank you. You're talking 24 hours. Hell, I rush this thing, the patient could die. The answer's no. Come on, Bobby. Let's go. O.K. Take care. Bye. What do you got there? He gave me this coin, a half-dollar from 1917. Hey, hold on, boys! Yeah. I'll be right back.
