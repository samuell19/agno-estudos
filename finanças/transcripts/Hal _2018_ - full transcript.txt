These are qualities that are all reflected both in the subjects that he chose to deal with and in the way that he dealt with them. ♪ And miles from nowhere ♪ ♪ I guess I'll take my time ♪ There was almost like a spiritual something about him. [man] Hal created such an inclusive environment. It almost felt like, you know, you were all impulses in the same brain. That's kind of how he made you feel. He wasn't at all the kind of person that I expected. Not quite Hollywood. He had his long, gray hair and this wonderful long, gray beard, and this eternal smile on his face. If you think about any of Hal Ashby's films, you're gonna find discussion of class, you're gonna find discussion of race. He wanted people, clearly, to love one another when society has tried to keep them apart. Hal Ashby is a warning story. I mean, that scared me. He had problems with authority. He went off the deep end, he became so committed to freedom of expression. [man] I think the films of Hal Ashby have had an enormous effect on most of the great filmmakers that we admire. To me, he's totally in the pantheon. Ten or eleven features, seven in the '70s that are just an astonishing string of masterpieces. We all looked to those movies as the best movies ever made. ♪ I love everything ♪ ♪ So don't it make you feel sad? ♪ ♪ Cause I'll drink to you, my baby ♪ ♪ I'll think to that ♪ ♪ I'll think to that ♪ ♪ Think to that ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Miles from nowhere ♪ ♪ Guess I'll take my time ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ To reach there ♪ [waves cresting] You can see in the letters we wrote to each other, there was a real love and a real bond between us. [bell dings] [Foster] Dearest dear heart Norman- Dearest most beautiful Norman. Dearest Norman- I can't tell you how good it was to receive your letter. We would say things about the film or about politics or about what was going on in our lives. [Foster] This will most certainly not be a memo of any sort. It will be closer to the ramblings of a very, very angry young punk. Norman, since I talked with you this afternoon, I have become so goddamn furiously frustrated from anger. I don't know what to do except sit here at this typewriter and rant and rave and hope I can cope with everything without losing my cool completely. If there's anyone you want me to kick in the shins or bite, please, please let me know. Eighteen loads of super double dynamite love, Hal. I don't think I've ever loved another man as much as I did Hal. [reels whirring] [Foster] Hitchhiked to Los Angeles when I was 17. Started smoking grass when I was 18. Had about 50 or 60 jobs since I was ten. Up to the time, I was working as a multilith operator at good old Republic Studios. I got my first job through the state employment department. You know, like a jerk, I went down there and I told them I wanted to get into the motion picture business. And that woman looked at me like, “What the hell is that?” And said, “Well, here's something at Universal with a multilith machine.” So, that was my first thing as far as getting into a studio. One day, while running off 90 or so copies of some now-forgotten page 14, I flashed on the idea of becoming a film director. “The best school for a director is in the cutting room” was the reply I heard most often. [Jewison] It was at MGM. He was working as an assistant editor on The Loved One. Shocking. I was walking by the editing room door, and he was looking at a little piece of film. I started to laugh, and Hal turned. And I said, “Hi. I'm Norman Jewison. I'm just, uh-I'm just on the lot because I'm preparing a film.” He said, “Come on in. Come on in.” I realized that we'd both kind of had the same sixth sense. [laughing] Immediately, I shared something with him. And then he told me that Bob Swink was William Wyler's editor and that he worked on Willie Wyler's films with Bob Swink. I just thought, “Oh, my God. Hal, you know William Wyler? You- You've sat in a room with William Wyler and edited his films?” [tape rewinding] [Ashby speaking on tape] I said, “Do you think you're ready to start cutting on your own?” And I tried to seduce Hal, because I believed he was ready. And so we started. Was Mr. Colbert ever in this greenhouse, say, last night about midnight? - Gillespie? - Yeah. You saw it. Oh, I saw it. Well, what are you gonna do about it? I don't know. [Jewison] We both had very strong feelings about racism in America. I felt that this could be an important film at this time, because timing is everything. Norman was sensitive and smart enough to know that bouncing ideas back and forth with Hal Ashby would be able to reach people. He trusted Hal to create this Rembrandt. I can imagine him in the editing room being woken up by Sidney Poitier. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Jewison] He believed in love, equality. He believed in all of the things that I held dear to my heart. And so, I just loved him. [Ashby speaking on tape] [man] One night we were working- Thomas Crown Affair. Then he said, “Oops! I forgot.” I said, “What?” “I'm supposed to be at the Academy. I've been nominated.” I said, “You have? Let's get out of here.” [car tires screeching] So we jump in the Jaguar and drive up there. When we got there, of course we got there late. Hal sat down. Must be a minute or so. He was talking to somebody back there. They call his name. I said, “Hal.” He said, “What?” “They're calling your name.” The winner is Hal Ashby for In the Heat of the Night. [orchestra playing] Thank you very much. Thank you. Uh, to repeat the words of a very dear friend of mine last year when he picked up his Oscar, I only hope that we can use all of our talents and creativity towards peace and love. - Thank you. -[audience applauding] Who wouldn't get excited or nervous about saying that kind of thing? There was “Thank you, my agent, thanks to my producer” and so forth. But those words, “peace and love-" Love meant the hippies, the other. And of course, peace means antiwar. [Jewison] By that time, we had made a number of films together, and so we moved into a bungalow. Frank Sinatra's bungalow on the Goldwyn lot. And we put a bed in there for Hal. I put flower boxes out, and I fixed it all up, like a little house because I found that when he really got into problems in editing or whatever, he'd smoke some pot and he would work all night. He'd have thousands of pieces of film with clothes pegs on blinds, and he knew where every frame was. I mean, he had an incredible mind. [Ashby speaking on tape] He'd work 24 hours straight. I mean, he'd work- seemed like days on end. I'd leave the studio and come back, and he'd still be there working away. He was obsessed. Hal Ashby was obsessed with film. [Ashby speaking on tape] We kind of said, “This is our place.” And we tried to keep everybody from the Mirisch Corporation out, and we tried to keep everybody from United Artists out. I told him from the very beginning, “The studio is not your friend. The studio is the enemy of the artist, because the studio is only interested in money. We are interested in art. We are interested in film. We are the artists, and we must defend ourselves, and we must always stick together.” And so Hal believed that. Ernest. Law and order. White, police, soldiers, gun, mace. Obeying the white establishment. - James. - I am black, and I am beautiful. - Malcolm. - I am black, and I am beautiful. Louise. I am black, and I am beautiful. [Jewison] It was a film that was going to be shot in New York. I was gonna direct it. And it was at that point where I realized that Hal really kind of wanted to direct. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Jewison] I made him associate producer. I'd involved him in the casting. I'd involved him in all aspects of the films. I felt he was ready. When we did The Landlord in Brooklyn, we chose the hotbed. Hal chose that place to do that movie. The riots had just taken place. Let's go to the belly of the beast and do this film where it's supposed to be taken. - Maybe we can do some good. -[man] Get out the car. Uh-oh! [chattering] We gon' have to watch out for this. What is this we have here? [man] You got to realize that at this time, the major cities in America were burning. They were on fire. Detroit, Los Angeles. And we were in the mouth of the dragon. [shouting] And I run down the street, and all these guys chase me for about three or four blocks. They had a long lens on the camera. [Gossett Jr.] He ran, and I ran after him. It was about a 90-degree day. It was hot. Everybody was out. Children were throwing water balloons. Mothers were pulling the children away. “Aaah! Get him! Get him! Get the boy!” “Get that white motherfucker! Take him down! Take him down!” And somewhere, when I was running, I said, “Oh, this stuff is real. I hope these are extras.” They were not extras. Malcolm X was at his top. We had some angry black people. Very angry. [Bridges] Now I have to walk back. And I'm thinking, I'm gonna take a bullet. This is it. And I start to walk, and I feel this big arm come around me. I put my arm around his shoulder. And probably saved his life or his head. I said, “Oh, this is just a movie. He's my friend.” Then we walked all the way back to the main camp that day. The film is about racial identity and how we see each other. Phew. Which is so important today. I think now things are coming to a head on every subject. And how many years ago was this? It's amazing. It was, at the time, courageous. That's how we were. That's how Hal Ashby was. That's how Norman Jewison was, and all those particular people. That far ahead of the time. [Ashby speaking on tape] Elgar, didn't we all go together to see Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? - Yeah. - It's just, Elgar, you have to realize all Negroes are not like that. [woman] Hal gave me the script to read, and I said, “I can do this because this woman is my family. And her whole narrow point-of-view and focus is something I've lived with all my life, and I know how to do it.” [Bridges] I've always felt that probably the biggest challenge for us as human beings is to get past the ignorance of racism. I think that's right at the heart of a lot of our problems. And just jumped at the chance to play a character that would really be able to take that on. [woman singing: R & B] -[door closes] -You're early. Yeah. The scene when Marki Bey comes home, and she's frustrated, she lashes out at Beau Bridges. What are you gonna do? I don't know what I'm gonna do, Elgar! I just don't know, so leave me alone! He doesn't take it personally at all. He just knows something's wrong. He says, “What's wrong?” And the way he does it- Beau Bridges- it's so beautiful. You gonna tell me what's wrong? [Payne] And then she turns and looks at him. I think that shot is the heart of the film and, in a way, the heart of some of- if I can be pretentious enough, some of Ashby's early work. Which is a look that says, “You see me. You see me. You love me, and I can love you.” And it really- it captures the exact moment when someone falls in love with someone else. [Mulvehill] I dealt with Hal all during the postproduction of The Landlord. I walk into his editing room and get a contact high. I think my role was to try to keep it as smooth as possible, to try to assuage the frustrations that other people- executives- had in dealing with him. It was usually a frustration with the distribution, the way that that was being handled. He hated prints of the two doorbells. It made him nuts. He'd get on the phone with New York and just rant and rave about the ad campaign. But by then, the film's out of your hands. [Bridges] The film was not a great commercial success. I don't know how people were ready to deal with a lot of that stuff. Terrifying racial images that were so sick and perverse that they were funny. I mean, you know, that's what he intended. A lot of his wit, I think, came from pain, the way I think maybe humor does come from facing adversity and stuff like that. [Foster] I was born in Ogden, Utah. Never a Mormon. I hated school. [man] He was the baby of the family. He was the apple of his mother's eye. I think that his parents' relationship was not in the greatest of shape and it was hoped that he would solidify their relationship, and ultimately that proved not to be the case. [Foster] Mom and Dad divorced when I was six. [Dawson] You know, he would see his father every week. He was in his life, but not in a very big way. [Foster] Dad killed himself when I was 12. [Dawson] The local newspaper report from the time, it talks about the bullet entered his body under his- under his chin. And, uh, it's a horrendous thing to happen to your father at any point in your life, but particularly at that point. He struggled through his teenage years, trying to find meaning in what had happened, and he was searching for his identity, and rebelling was as good a way as any to assert his individuality. [Foster] I struggled towards growing up, like most others, totally confused. Joined the dropouts in my senior year of high school and didn't really get along with my family. [woman] Did you enjoy life when you were a child? Oh, yes, you were a wonderful baby, Harold. Do you think the sexual revolution has gone too far? It certainly has. Do you find the idea of wife-swapping distasteful? I even find the question distasteful. - Do you- -[gunshot] [chair clattering] Harold, please! [man] I think it's ultimately a very uplifting, happy movie. I mean, just because there's a bunch of suicide jokes in it doesn't mean it's not a positive, sunny film. It is in our house. I suppose you think that's very funny, Harold. [laughs quietly] Early on, Hal was very, very picky about the projects that he chose. I mean, he went through tons of scripts before he found Harold and Maude. [Ashby speaking on tape] He gave it to me, said, “Read it. What do you think?” I said, “Oh, I don't know. It's, like, weird.” [dramatic piano playing] [Jewison] I think it was the humor that always saved Hal and myself from getting melodramatic. There was always something kind of weird. [laughs] Or strange. I can't stand much more of this. [crying] I can't take any more! Oh, God! [gagging] [Ashby speaking on tape] I think there was a soul connection there and a real understanding of each other. And Bud Cort is a very particular creature. Like, in an encyclopedia of creatures, you know, he has his own page. And Hal Ashby made him feel safe, Hal Ashby dialed into his frequency. [Cort] My father was dying when I met Hal. I was an emotional minefield. But I wanted the part. And he took a chance on me. And in so doing, became not only a director, but, uh, a father, -a mother, a driving instructor- -[scattered laughter] And a psychiatric nurse. [laughter] [Cort] Hal, here's a moth for you. It's dead, but it's pretty. You are a genius. Your humble servant, Harold Parker Chasen the First. [woman] Some guy in Cambridge, Mass. wrote a letter, and he said, “I'm at a loss to know why this means so much to me.” And I think about it a lot, and I've finally come to the conclusion that it's because, to get through life, you have to have somebody to tell it to. I like you, Maude. Mmm. I like you, Harold. [classical music plays] Ruth Gordon, she was one of those real kind of old-style, uh, Hollywood actresses that, you know, we don't have anymore. [Ashby speaking on tape] ♪ And if you wanna be me Be me ♪ ♪ If you wanna be you Be you ♪ ♪ Cause there's a million things to do ♪ ♪ You know that there are ♪ Harold, join in. [man] One time, I had to kind of run it over with Ruth. She wasn't getting it right, you know, and I was a little bit upset 'cause she wasn't quite doing the little turns that I do. Um, but of course, that was- that was her. And, um, it ends up in the film a great moment. She does it all her own way. But she was one of those who- she did it her way. [Islam] ♪ And if you want to be free Be free ♪ ♪ Cause there's a million things to be ♪ ♪ You know that there are ♪ [Ashby speaking on tape] I always intended to do those songs properly, but Hal stuck them in the film because he probably had a deadline to get the film out. And I was a little bit horrified when I heard- I said, “No, no. I haven't quite done them yet.” But they were still demos to me. But the strange thing is everybody loves those songs because they're so raw and so natural, sort of, kind of free and no self-consciousness about them. And that's what made the songs kind of perfect for the film. His type of style of allowing the artists to do their part and not worry about him too much, so they could be free. And that's why I think he kind of became so important. Because he was that independent kind of mind which didn't fit in quite. I like to watch things grow. [man] Teenagers who were older than me, they said, “Oh, my God. You haven't seen Harold and Maude? Oh, David, you have to see Harold and Maude.” And they said it from, like, the bowels of their souls. They grow and bloom and fade and die and change into something else. Ah, life. And it was beautiful and warm, yet it was as existential as you could possibly be. [laughing] There's a guy who wanted to die every day. -[woman laughing] - Must have been very funny. [gasping] Harold! We had high hopes. We thought it was the greatest thing ever done. -[bell dings] -[Foster] Having returned from New York and having viewed rushes. Must tell you I am elated by film. Hal got Pablo involved and said, “Pablo's gonna do the trailer.” And... so- [laughing] There was one shot in that where Bud gives Ruth a passionate kiss, and they fall down to the bed. I said, “Oh, that's great!” Went to show it to Bob Evans, the head of the studio. [Mulvehill] They had a hemorrhage. He was so mad. - What? -[siren wailing] [Mulvehill] They were so pissed off. He said, “How can you do this?” I said, “What do you mean? Didn't you read the script? It's a love story.” ♪ So shine, shine, shine ♪ ♪ Shine, shine, shine Shine, shine ♪ Hal and I were kind of surprised that they were that angry about it. I mean, they were angry about it. And, uh, it's not the movie they were releasing, as far as they were concerned. I mean- And therein lies the problem, I think. [Ashby speaking on tape] I love that the poster to Harold and Maude was just the words, “Harold and Maude.” They didn't even know how to put a picture on it. [laughing] They're, like, “Can we show Harold and not Maude? What can we do here?” You can imagine the marketing panic. [Foster] Dear Bob, Another sleepless night and another try at some form of letter. From the beginning, I put my faith and trust in you and Paramount, and one thing I have stressed is my absolute fanaticism in regards to honesty, to which you all agreed. Though I doubt that Paramount much cares, my energies and most certainly whatever creative talents or abilities I do have are at the point where I fear they may disappear in total. When he finally had to give up the film, I mean, he'd really go into major depressions. We were driving back to the house, and he just broke down and started crying. It's a release from the frustrations of the shoot. I think also that he was gonna lose control of that particular process. [Foster] Much peace and love, Hal Ashby. PS: I feel like I could make this film about as funny as the Vietnam War. [boat horn blowing in distance] -[man] Can you hear me now, Jack? -[on phone] Yeah. Good. I thought we'd start off just by giving us some idea of the nature of the film that you're doing up there. What's it all about? [Nicholson on phone] Uh, it's a film about, um, I guess you'd say military justice, or injustice, really. It's a story of two guys who are taking a young kid to, uh- They're delivering him to Portsmouth Naval Prison. [Mintz] Uh, for what? What did the kid do? He, uh, stole some money. Forty dollars. Gets eight years. [Mintz] Hmm. Are you- Do you- That's just what I said. MAA sent me. He wants to see you right away. Tell MAA to go fuck himself. [Ashby speaking on tape] The law says I have to serve him and says I can't- I'll tell you what you better do, Mr. Citizen Bartender. You take your beers and ram 'em up your ass sideways. - You dig it? - Whoa there, sunshine. We're going, so you can take your hand off that horse cock you got stashed under the bar. The original problem with getting the movie made was the studio. They wanted me to change the language in it, and I didn't want to. “Well, wouldn't ten 'motherfuckers' be more dramatic than 20?" How do you know I don't have something with a little more buck to it? Ho-ho-ho. This redneck is talking about firearms. Well, I know that you ain't got nothin' but wood under there, my man, because I happened to be in here one night when a certain sailor got it laid up the side of his fucking head. What do you think about that, redneck? [Mulvehill] We, uh- We tried to get military cooperation. The Department of Defense came back and said that they weren't gonna help. They weren't gonna cooperate because, uh, you know, today's sailor doesn't swear. You try it, and I'll call the shore patrol. I am the motherfucking shore patrol, motherfucker! I am the motherfucking shore patrol! Now give this man a beer. We did what we wanted to do, really. We just said, “Fuck it,” you know? And of course, Hal was all for it. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Towne] What we were doing was just showing an inherently unjust situation and how people responded to it. And it wasn't so much the military. It was all of us. [man] My first interaction with Hal Ashby was he got a job that I wanted, The Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming! I'd just done Mad World, so I thought I deserved Russians are Coming! But he got it, so right away I didn't like him very much. [Mulvehill] The original editor left, and Bob got on board. They finished shooting and came back. The producer called and asked if I'd reconsider. I said, “No, Hal is crazy. He works 24 hours a day. And he works at his house. I don't want any of that.” The producer said, “Please come and look at some of the film.” I looked at the film, I loved it, and I did it. And I started off a great relationship. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Jones] The studio was scared to death of the language in the film. The head of the editorial department at Columbia called and he said, “Bob, I'm sending up a truck. Would you have your assistants pack up the film, and we're taking it over.” I said, “You're doing what?” “We're taking over the film. It's a corporate decision.” And they said, “Sorry, you got to do it.” I said no. So, 20 minutes later I got a call from somebody else at Columbia. He said, “Bob, we're sending up a truck. Have your assistants pack up the film. We're taking it over. It's a corporate decision. It's not your decision. It's not my decision. Get to work.” I said no. Hang up. 'Bout a half an hour later, the head of Columbia calls me. “Bob, it's a corporate decision. It's not your decision. It's not my decision. Pack up the film.” I said, “John, after I hang up on you, I'm sending all my assistants home and I'm calling the police, and I'm gonna sit by the window.” Bang. And in the meantime, I called Hal's attorney. So we saved the film. Goddamn grunts. - Think they can get away with anything. - Yeah. Tellin' me how to do my job. I know my job. I know my goddamn job better than anybody else in the goddamn navy. [Dawson] His inability to really play ball- People would put that down to, “This guy's out of control. He's a drug addict.” It was Hal who introduced me to pot. All of a sudden I saw that, “Oh, man, this is good. I feel better and, uh, the world doesn't look as bad as it did before.” I think we were just so rebellious. He wasn't dealing with addiction. He was struggling with- with issues regarding authority. You understand his brilliance and the greatness of the man and his dedication professionally. Uh, those things were always intact. So you tend to take his side, and I would tend to take his side. [Foster] Most beautiful and super Julie, You are beyond a doubt the most super, far out, groovy lady I have ever met. [Towne] I don't know how he managed, but he had this wonderful habit of trading in girlfriends. I don't know, I used to tease him about it because about every two years, as it happened, he- and it would be a new, very nice, lovely girl. [Mulvehill] Whatever woman was in Hal's life at the time, I knew. Hal usually involved them in the film on one level or another. For instance, Joanie, she was his assistant and handled the phone for him and read scripts. He married Joan on the set. [Ashby speaking on tape] [laughing] I thought, Jesus, where's he gone? He's been smoking too much. [Mulvehill] Dianne did a lot of the clearances and the film gathering. Hal was known not to be a big sleeper. And so whenever we had any contact, or how I observed him, was an artist working. What attracted me to Hal was his smile, his laugh, his straightforwardness. He never slept more than two hours... ever. He'd get up, go to the next room, and do some of his work or write or we'd take naps, make love for two hours. There was no greater place to be than to the left of Hal in that bed. [Dawson] He was a great enthusiast, and he was a great romantic. And he loved women, and women loved him. [Schroeder] He was passionate about his work and definitely didn't want to compromise that in any way. The thing is that Hal really is married to the job, to his work. [Foster] My life with Joan is all fucked again, and I'm sad and once again living- [chuckles] in the office. I don't think any relationship or any- [laughs] wife or any family or anything meant as much to Hal as his work. Hal didn't talk a lot about his past. In fact, we- we didn't really do history. Obviously, there were others, weren't there? [sighs] Obviously. I didn't actually know that he was, uh, married so many times until he was gone, and every day a wife was calling. And I finally called Larry, the executor, and I said, “Exactly how many are there?” - How many? - What do you want to know for? - Because I want to know, that's all. - What difference does it make? He was married five times, and then he decided he was done. You really want to know? Yes. [sighs] There were a couple of- I mean, there were- Uh- Jesus. I-I-I- There- This- [sighs] Let's face it. I fucked 'em all. [Grant] This was Warren Beatty's film, and Hal was the director of Warren's film. [Ashby speaking on tape] He wanted to do a story about a compulsive Don Juan. I had been going with a girl who had been married, and I said, “Who were you married to?” “A guy called Gene Shacove. He's a hairdresser. Not only that, he's still doing my hair.” I met Shacove, and there was this guy, uh, surrounded by the most beautiful women in town. I thought, this fucking guy really has it made. Warren wrote Shampoo with Robert Towne, and they would often times be on the set, and they would have these big arguments. “Cut. Uh, print. Oh, just a minute. Let me talk to Bob. Bob? What's that, Bob? Oh, really. Oh. Okay, well, why don't you say this instead?” [Deschanel] Finally, at the end, they sort of turned around and, “Hal, what do you think?” Hal would just go, “Oh, well, I think you should just go out the door and come back in and say the lines.” And Warren would say- And Hal was always right. [Ashby speaking on tape] George, for Christ's sakes, don't let me drink too much. You don't do that anymore, do you? [Russell] I think that when you're coming up, really, out of the Eisenhower years, all the way up through the Hal Ashby era, there's a feeling of what's hovering around you is a kind of hypocrisy. For the people, for the country, for our Constitution. [Russell] And you can feel the Nixon election happening. You can feel people's narcissism missing the whole point of what's happening. A teenager held up a sign. 'Bring us together.” And that will be the great objective of this administration at the outset- to bring the American people together. - Hmm. - This will be an open administration. Ten days after the film was released, Nixon resigned. Watergate was the unspoken background of all this. This is where it was leading. Maybe Nixon will be better. What's the difference? They're all a bunch of jerks. [Ashby speaking on tape] [people laughing] [Ashby mutters] That's- That's basically- [Ashby chuckles] [laughing continues] I don't think there's an award for what Warren Beatty had to do to get Shampoo on, but I respect him and love him and Robert Towne. And my director, Hal Ashby, who encourages an actor to fly without a net because you know he's there to catch you. [Mulvehill] After Hal had done Shampoo, there was an attitudinal change. He'd finally gotten his due. Because Harold and Maude came and went, and The Last Detail, it did okay. And then he went off and did Shampoo. That was his first major success. - Whoo-wheel -[laughing] And, uh, of course that means more money too. And he felt like he was- he had arrived. I think that there was a slight attitudinal change. You now have new sponsors, Woody, and, uh, they've insisted that there be no controversial material on their program. Does that mean... I can't do my own songs on the show? Of course you can sing your own songs, long as it doesn't get anybody riled up. [announcer] He loved freedom as much as he loved the people he sang for. His name was Woody Guthrie. The story of this man who couldn't be bought is being recreated on film by director Hal Ashby and co-producers Robert Blumofe and Harold Leventhal. ♪ Oh, you can't scare me I'm sticking to the union ♪ ♪ I'm sticking to the union I'm sticking to the union ♪ ♪ Oh, you can't scare me I'm sticking to the union ♪ ♪ I'm sticking to the union Till the day I die ♪ [woman] The care to detail in this movie- It's like every single person gave a shit every single second. [Ashby speaking on tape] And they didn't just care about the day. They cared about this moment, what I'm capturing right here. All of that went into the fabric of that film. [Wexler] That was a difficult film to shoot, with a lot of trains and, uh, tough stuff of simulating dust and, uh, wind machines. [Ashby speaking on tape] We shot a million feet of film on Bound for Glory. And, uh, looked at every foot of it. You'd shoot all day, and then you'd go to dailies, and you'd say, “How many reels of dailies?” Twenty. I was like, “Oh, no.” I mean, it was, you know- 'Cause Hal looked at everything. He looked at everything, and he remembered everything. And Hal was under a lot of pressure to get it done. And also a lot of pressure from the family and representatives of Woody that what was getting done was not what they thought was right. [Ashby speaking on tape] I got word that Hal fired me. It was frustration. I mean, we were over schedule. Not that it was Haskell's fault, per se. And Hal was having a difficult time communicating with Haskell, and they- he- I don't know. It was- I mean, because Hal and Haskell were really, really close. Don't push me out! When he was under pressure, he did look for sustenance. His drug of choice was unambiguously marijuana. That was his thing, but he had dabbled in cocaine. David Carradine talks about his cocaine use on the set of Bound for Glory. It's kind of funny thinking of David Carradine as like the cool-headed, conservative voice of reason, but that's kind of what he was in that moment. I'd been down Hal's room to say, um, “Stop taking that stuff up your nose. I'm going to work and no one else is shooting. You know?” [Ashby speaking on tape] Bound for Glory was the first theatrical use of the Steadicam. [man shouting] I'm payin' four cents a bushel! [men shouting] [man] Four cents! So line up over here by the gate! [Wexler] When I wanted to do that shot, I mentioned it to Hal. He said, “Yeah, it'd be great. Try the shot, you know.” [man] Line up over here by the gate in single file! His openness, when all these other pressures were on him to try something that may not work. [laughing] And because he has some imagination and some belief in me. Of course, I didn't know it'd work for sure or not. And the winner is Haskell Wexler, Bound for Glory. I want to thank all the fellow workers on Bound for Glory. As all of you know better than anyone, filmmaking is a cooperative thing, and we had- we had a good crew, good people, and a good film. Thank you. Whether it's authentic about Woody Guthrie's life, it's authentic about America for me. It doesn't matter to me if it's Woody Guthrie or not. That character becomes a folkloric character to tell us something about America and about human experience. Seeing that ominous blackness swallowing up all hope for people at that time, with the world wars, with the rise of Hitler, and our economy here- the banks failing- that black cloud is not just in Oklahoma. It's not just the dust bowl. But also, it becomes the larger issues that were gonna become the struggle for people like Woody Guthrie. That don't mean nothin'. Well, if it don't, what does? [crying] I know it ain't me and the kids. You don't think nothin' about runnin' off whenever you get the urge. Oh, Mary-Ann. Don't even talk like that. Now, I truly care about you and the kids. I truly care. Well, that sure ain't the way it seems. You're spending your whole life out there, trying to fix the world! You're not doing nothin' to help our family. Oh, hell! Well, I really believe that Hal was about peace and love. I think he cared about the world. I think his movies, they were standing up and saying, you know, the war was crazy. I think he was actually trying to do some good. But, um, peace and love in his own life was hard to come by, and he didn't do a good job of that. I grew up, I think, pretty much just like any other kid... except I had a dad out there that I didn't know. I was born in September. My mom and Hal, they moved into their own apartment. I would go to Grandma Ashby's a lot when I was really little. And she just was crazy about me. Grandma was on him pretty good. I think she wanted him taking care of us, and she did not want the situation to be as it was. He wanted to work for his family. He couldn't find anything in Ogden. And so he went up north and worked in the oil fields first. He ended up, of course, leaving there and going to California and starting his career. I only think he stayed around for about nine months. [Dawson] He was 17 and, you know, most people when they're 17, those relationships don't last, and the weight of fatherhood did not fall well upon him. I have asked for this radio and television time tonight for the purpose of announcing that we, today, -have concluded an agreement- -[crowd] Liar! Liar! To end the war and bring peace with honor in Vietnam. [woman] I had spent about three years talking to members of the military- all branches of the service. I really wanted to make a movie that was about the Vietnam War from the point of view of veterans. One day I was asked to speak at a rally at Claremont College. The other speaker was a Vietnam veteran named Ron Kovic. And he said to the students, "I may have lost my body, but I've gained my mind.” And I thought right then, I can make a movie based on that concept. I believe that all of us grew up with John Wayne, that whole movie cinema image- the toy guns, the Mattel submachine guns that we got every Christmas. The whole generation was prepped and hyped and conditioned by our culture, which is so violent and which is so- which so romanticizes war. We were ready to go. We were ready to fight. We thought that the war was going to be like the John Wayne movies. But it wasn't. It was different. When we came home and tried to tell the American public about the reality of the Vietnam War, that it wasn't a war to help people, but it was a crime against humanity and against the Vietnamese people, they didn't listen to us- they threw us in jail. We didn't get nothing for it. They gave us a piece of paper that says to us we are Vietnam veterans and we can get disability, and we can get this, and we can get a job, and we ain't got- [man] Whoa, baby. [man 2] Calm down. Hal started with an idea that he had been keeping in his pocket, which was that he was gonna get a bunch of guys who were wounded. And he had me on a gurney, 'cause that's where I was in the opening of the picture. So he said, “Jon, you just stick back there. We'll just improvise a bit. You guys talk about your experience.” And they were all vets. What a smart idea. You call the draft not being forced? I ain't saying the draft in our country. I'm talking about another country that's having something forced upon them, or an individual- It's all to get you to go fight for somebody else. [Ashby speaking on tape] That was Haskell's brilliant cinematography- very unobtrusive, cameras far away. Just setting Jon Voight into the middle of it, listening, really set a tone. It just went right past artifice and, like, you were in it, it was real. You know, like all of a sudden I'm, like, into these guys. Like, who are these people? Some of us need to justify to ourselves what the fuck we did there. So if we come back and say what we did was a waste, what happened to us was a waste, some of us can't live with it. [Cholodenko] It just felt authentic. And the power of the cut to that Stones song. [fingers snapping] [Russell] Bruce Dern running on that military base to “Out of Time” by the Stones, a song I'd never fully explored or understood. But, boy, once I saw it in that movie, he explained that song to me, Hal Ashby. ♪ You're out of touch, my baby ♪ ♪ My poor, discarded baby ♪ ♪ I said, baby, baby, baby ♪ [Cholodenko] It's sort of an obvious parallel to action. With something like that, usually I would be cynical. “Yeah, yeah.” I didn't feel like that at all. I felt like somehow with that Stones song and with the setup and the authenticity- He had me. I believed it. [Ashby speaking on tape] [chuckles] The first thing I did was I got a chair. Then I went out and found a group of paraplegic basketball players, most of them vets, and tried always to be one of the team, one of the people. [man] No one ever saw Jon Voight out of his wheelchair. He would wheel himself everywhere- to the set. There were a couple of times when we were shooting upstairs, and I saw the grip sort of somewhat reluctantly carrying him in his chair up the stairs. Whoo! [Ashby speaking on tape] When we started Coming Horme, there was only 23 pages of script written. Waldo Salt had been writing the screenplay. And Waldo Salt had a heart attack. -[Jones] Hal called me one day and said, uh- -[ringing] Will you come down and rewrite the script? It was about a 200-page script with a second act that lost its structure and it didn't have an ending. It was a terrifying experience. I want to say that I'm really shocked. I'm just shocked that you'd rather write about a goddamn home run -than about what's going on in this hospital. -[woman)] Sally, please. [Fonda] While we were shooting, a lot of it was improvised. It was certainly the most improvised movie that I had ever done. What are you saying? That you're not even gonna make the effort? [screaming] What I'm saying is I do not belong in this house! A lot of what was told to me by wives and by soldiers are actually lines in the movie. And the character of Sally was based on the women that I met. And partly on me because the Vietnam War changed me very much. [chuckling] He's not gonna like the fact that I've- I've changed. And I have changed. You know, she realizes that what she has believed is a lie. And a lot of the women that I interviewed... knew that. [Jeff Wexler] When the last scene was proposed, Hal said early on the only direction he was gonna give Jon Voight was you're there, you're in the chair, of course, you're gonna talk to the high school. That was it. He said, “Do you know what you want to say?” Yeah, I did. I'm gonna improvise it. [sighs] [Ashby speaking on tape] [Dern] About a quarter of the way through shooting the film, Hal came to me one day, he said, “Dernsey-" He said, "I got the end." And I looked at him and, uh, you know, I expected him to hand me some pages. And, uh, he said, “Uh, right here. Jon is gonna go to the high school in the wheelchair. He's gonna give this eloquent speech. And Jane is gonna say her piece to you and leave. And you're gonna head out across the beach to the edge of the water, take your clothes off, and go into the sea and vanish forever.” And I said, “But, Hal. I mean, Jon's gonna get to speak at the high school.” [laughter] “Jane's gonna get to say something to me. And I don't get to say anything?” [laughter continues] [Jeff Wexler] It was so all over the map, that when it was all done, I remember talking to Pop. The reaction was, “We've just lost the movie.” But Hal was happy as hell. He knew he had it. We weren't thinking like editors. And, in fact, in the final movie, it's a brilliant scene. [Ashby speaking on tape] There's a lot of shit that I did over there- that I find fucking hard to live with. And I don't want to see people like you, man, coming back and having to face the rest of your lives with that kind of shit. It's as simple as that. I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm a lot fucking smarter now than when I went. And I'm just telling you... that there's a choice to be made here. The winner is Jon Voight in Coming Home! The winner is Jane Fonda in Coming Home. The winner is- Nancy Dowa, Waldo Saff, and Robert C. Jones for Coming Home. Coming Home! I want to thank Hal Ashby. You're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste, and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors. I'd like to thank Hal Ashby, a remarkable- a remarkable person who was so helpful in getting me to myself and encouraging my performance. - But, uh- -[static hissing] After this, I do a film that's been my ambition to do for the last seven years. [woman] Can you tell us what it is? A subject called Being There, which will be directed by Hal Ashby. And it'll come out around about electioneering time. It's non-political, but if has a lot to say about what can happen in life. It is- To me, it's a perfect movie. And in my moments of self-doubt, when I think about what I do for a living, and I think, what is the bar and how far am I from the bar, the bar is always Being There. [female newscaster] This morning the president met in the Oval Office with foreign dignitaries- [man] He learns everything from the television. He does. He learns how to shake hands and tip a cap. And then it works in the real world. It's all about artifice over substance. Mr. Gardiner, what was your reaction to the Post editorial on the president's speech? I did not read that. The fact that he's so indifferent and doesn't understand the stakes of the world he's operating in is so refreshing to everyone because they're all so freaked out about power. Look, we can give you a six-figure advance. I'll provide you with the very best ghostwriter, proofreaders. - I can't read. - Of course you can't! No one has the time. We-We glance at things. We watch television. Tsk. [muffled] I like to watch TV. Oh, sure, you do. [Deschanel] When Hal and I started talking about it, we kind of decided that it was a film about power and politics, that it was not treated like a comedy at all. I mean, we shot it to look like a film that, if Peter Sellers wasn't in the movie, it would be a serious movie. Chauncey, you have the Russian ambassador eating right out of your hand. You know that? I didn't know you spoke Russian. It's incredible. It is extremely useful to speak Russian today. I was thinking about Jerzy Kosinski's background, because he's a Holocaust survivor, he knows fascism firsthand. And the fact that he was drawn to the nature of celebrity, that he saw how celebrity can just spark and kind of shine out of nowhere, and before you know it, millions of people are following an idiot, uh, and that can be both really funny and really horrifying. [Deschanel] It was based on this book by Jerzy Kosinski, but the script that we used when we made the movie was written by Bob Jones. [Jones] So I read the three scripts that Jerzy Kosinski, the novelist, had written. The first one was bad, and the second one was terrible, and the third one was unreadable. Got rid of those and started with the book. Kosinski loved it, but he also said, “I'm not gonna share credit with anybody.” And Hal told me that, and we both laughed. “Sure, sure.” [Ashby speaking on tape] It was like a knife to the gut. And I didn't get credit. [McKay] I think the amazing part of the writing is that this childlike, ADD, savant state that he's in lines up so perfectly with what this giant, 300,000-square-foot house of power needs desperately. Do you realize, more people will be watching you tonight than all those that have seen theater plays in the last 40 years? - Oh, yes? - Yes. Why? Hell, I don't know. [laughing] It's definitely one of the more astute movies when you talk about celebrity. It has that dark edge to it. It has the fact that celebrity is a really dangerous thing- the randomness of it. It's for sure a white man's world in America. It is possible to be flooded in one part- Hell, I raised that boy since he was the size of a pissant. And I say right now he never learned to read and write. No, sir. Had no brains at all. No, he's a real gardener. He does talk like one. But I think he's brilliant. [TV audience applauding] All you got to be is white in America to get whatever you want. [TV audience cheering, whistling, applauding] Peter was terrific through that whole movie. I mean, you hear these nightmare stories about Peter Sellers, and he can be very difficult. And basically, what it got down to is that on Hal's sets, you never had a problem with the actors. They were involved in the process. They loved what Hal was doing. They loved Hal. [man] TV. Go ahead. Hello there. This is Peter Sellers speaking to you from MGM Studios, Culver City, right in the heart of Hollywood, which, as you know, is movie land. We are here- That is to say, Hal and I- Hal Ashby, our director. - Hal? - Hello. Hal has made many, many successful films such as, um, uh- Tomorrow's New Yesterday and, um- Backwards Before Dawn. Backwards Before Dawn was another huge success. You realize he was way ahead of the curve as far as media, all as a way to kind of simulate wisdom and actual intelligence. And you look at our culture now, and it's exactly what it's become. But we're well aware that billionaires want to control the government and control legislation to serve themselves. And it's also about picking someone that you can control so that they'll do your bidding. [whispering] What about Chauncey Gardiner? But what do we know of the man? Absolutely nothing. - We don't have an inkling of his past. - Correct. That could be an asset. [Bill] The last scene of Being There, one of the most magical scenes in the history of my watching movies, and combines a lot of elements, I think, that say all about Hal. It's smart. It's human. It's bizarre. [Ashby speaking on tape] It was slightly controversial because I think there were some people at Lorimar and other places who didn't like it because it was kind of like- [Ashby speaking on tape] [Mulvehill] The whole idea of it, you know, was they couldn't fathom it. It made no sense to them. [Ashby speaking on tape] [laughs] [pop song intro playing] In film school, when I started making films and thinking about who was influential to me as a filmmaker, I would cite, like, the obvious people that came out of that tradition- Coppola and Scorsese, and then there was the great French filmmakers. But I knew somewhere, like, there's some seminal films that were really humanistic that I'm- Like, who made them? Why am I missing something? I'm missing some piece of this. It's still astonishing to me why he hasn't had his due. The '70s was a very weird time. It was a very special time, I mean, in terms of, you know, the filmmaking. [Towne] It was the habit of executives at that time to kind of let us do what we wanted to do. And I think their attitude was, “Okay, you go ahead and do what you want to do. If it doesn't work, you'll never work again.” The '80s came about, and everything changed. It was just kind of the end of the character-driven drama. It must have been a shock to their system when Reagan stopped enforcing the antitrust laws so everything started to monopolize, and you had, like, what now is five companies owning all the media. [Mulvehill] The studios all became formal corporate entities. You had to deal with bureaucracy. Hal was in constant conflict with that. He was an artist, he wanted to make his films, and they're interested in-in the business. [Jewison] They were all suits, and they have only one interest- money. You know, it's really interesting that, like, I am a huge Hal Ashby fan. And I am ignorant of his films in the '80s. I don't even really remember the experience. I return constantly to his seven films of the '70s, but there's something about- there was a break somehow. [Bill] Usually you make an unsuccessful movie, so to speak, at the beginning of your career, not at the end of it. That was a tough film. It wasn't successful. It hurt me because it wasn't successful for Hal, probably more than myself. [man] Normally, director'd say “Cut.” You know, it's not anything. He would just keep rolling. A lot of footage. Tremendous amount of footage. And that was one of the problems. And we were so over budget. Lorimar was going crazy. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Mulvehill] He'd write memos, long memos, heartfelt, passionate memos. [Foster] I honestly don't think we should kiss their asses, singularly or collectively, just because it's tough to make deals at this time. I would rather have no deal at all than do this. A lot of people would say to him- and his attorneys- “When it's on paper, it's there forever. So, why don't you have a phone conversation?” But he wouldn't have it. He just didn't wanna do it. - I don't wanna talk to you. Jerry- - Please. I don't want to talk to you! - I don't wanna talk- Please, Jerry, please. - Trying to understand you. I don't want to talk to these people. He's trying to understand you, and he's being extremely kind. [squeals] [Macmanus] I mean, there was this dark place that he went to. He got to a point, and then he just ran from it. Can I try? People laugh when I say this too, but that's my favorite movie of his. And he did it for me. And the little girl, who was Angelina Jolie, at the end, was me. Your daddy's, uh- - He's a nice man. - You are too. I'm gonna get a cab. Taxi! - Can I go play with my teddy? - You sure can. And it was the little girl that didn't know her father, and the man that couldn't be her father. I think he just always ran... the other way. You know, his dad had committed suicide. When you have issues, you know, with your parents and with your childhood, and they're unbearable, you don't deal with it. And I think, you know, he didn't deal with those things. Ashby was supposed to direct Tootsie. - Some incredible footage that Haskell Wexler shot. - Yes, Jean. Things seemed to be going really well in our preparation. [Ashby] How'd that look, Haskell? [Wexler] Uh, yeah, she looks pretty good. Can we just see her profile? No, look at me. Ashby had not yet delivered Lookin' to Get Out. [Padilla] He had just finished the film. He had done his director's cut. And they wanted another one, and he said, “No, I'm working on Tootsie.” [Dawson] Columbia withdrew their offer of employment to him because Lorimar said that they would sue if Ashby worked on it. This was about them throwing around their weight and about showing him who was boss. [Foster] It seems my frustration and anger grows with each and every day. -[typing] - I have absolutely no contact with any of them, which is just as well, as all I would want to do is yell “fuck you” at them until my voice gave out. Beyond a doubt, they are all the prize assholes of all time who have not one ounce of talent aside from that of really knowing how to be really super liars, cheats, and generally bad people. Boy, oh, boy. I wish, uh- [man] Who are you? [chuckles] I'm Matt. I'm an alcoholic. [group] Hi, Matt. [man] I did a movie with Hal called 8 Million Ways to Die. He said that- “And the way I work, Jeff, the script is just a sketch. It's not really anything like the movie's gonna be.” I said, “Oh, really?” He said, “Yeah, I'm mostly interested in the substance abuse aspects of the film, not so much the cop drama.” -[man] Stoli, for the lady. - Go ahead. Have another. Care to join me? The great thing about Hal was if things weren't working, even on the page, he just had this freedom, like allowing the actors to kind of create within the space of what's happening and their characters and just filming it. [Ashby speaking on tape] They were on him, I know, like, just the studio- just on him so horribly. [Jeff Bridges] I can't blame the financiers for being a little uptight because, you know, he wasn't following a script. But you got to look at the pudding that's coming out of this guy's oven, man. He's the master. Look what he's done and he's gonna do for you if you just let him. [Dare] Were you aware of the way he works before you got involved with him? I mean, did you know he was gonna improvise? [Damon] Um, I knew that Hal was a very talented director, and when we hired Hal, we hired, um, a man whose talents we knew would eventually come out on the screen. [Jeff Bridges] We left. At the end of the movie, Hal gave it to his editor to assemble. He was gonna take two weeks off. And this producer came in and kidnapped the film, fired Hal, and proceeded to cut the film just totally against the grain. [Dare] I mean, you do agree that one of Hal's greatest skills is in editing? [Damon] Um, Hal certainly has a reputation of being a great editor. [Dare] Right. [Mulvehill] And they all think they can cut a film. They all think they know how to make a film. They figure if they can just get rid of that asshole that shot the film, then they're gonna get in the room and they're gonna make those choices because they really know what to do and how to- I mean, they're off in fantasy land. [Foster] Dear Mr. Ashby, In light of your persistent refusal to communicate with us in various production and post-production personnel, despite phone calls and written requests, and your representative's assertion that you will only talk to us at a DGA “hotline” meeting, you have presented us with no alternative but to deem your conduct tantamount to a resignation or, in the alternative, to remove you immediately from all further involvement with respect to 8 Million Ways to Die. [Dawson] Studios would use his reputation as a drug user against him to disgrace him and be the publicly given reason for the disintegration of a relationship. [Griffis] I mean, the things I read, I can't even believe, because it's not who I observed. [Mulvehill] And, uh, he was just the next thing to a junkie. It was all bullshit. But I mean, it was all stuff that they had fabricated in their own minds about, you know, where Hal was to kind of justify their own actions, I think. I live in a world I didn't make. I know that now. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Dawson] He loved the films that he made, and he was so emotionally invested in them. [Foster] Dearest Norman, Since we talked, I have, needless to say, been giving the whole thing a lot of thought. To date, my conclusion has been thus- fuck... them! [Gossett Jr.] He was so sensitive of what's right and what's wrong. He fought for us. But if you fight nose-to-nose with the head of a studio, you're going to lose. [Islam] ♪ Trouble ♪ ♪ Oh, trouble, set me free ♪ ♪ I have seen your face ♪ ♪ And it's too much Too much for me ♪ I think the nightmare for people like Hal Ashby probably was that when you start a project, people say, "I totally believe in what you want to do and I'm gonna support you.

Usually it starts with somebody kissing your ass, saying, “I'm not gonna fuck with you.” And then they fuck with you till you lose your mind.

[laughter] And everybody in the audience laughed because they knew that when you worked with Hal, you always felt that you were his favorite. And he had this remarkable, incredible sensibility that would just make everybody want to do their best work. [Jewison] Hal didn't want to die. He wanted to make another movie. 'Cause that's all he- that's all he lived for. [Ashby speaking on tape] His greatest priority in his approach to his work was to tell the truth. If executives got in his way, he was always ready to take a stand. [Ashby speaking on tape] [Macmanus] I'm really, really, really proud of you. And not just because he was this great director of the '70s or that he had this insight. He's that shining star. He was just a wonderful example of the human spirit and what we're capable of. To make seven great films in nine years is a tremendous, uh, force of will. ♪ A long, steady fine ♪ The big name that comes up, I think, more than- of the new filmmakers is Hal Ashby. ♪ Now that you're gone ♪ ♪ I have nothing but time ♪ In retrospect, when I look back, I say, “Well, now that I see all the influence he has, it seems, in a way, that he's not gone at all.” We're all artists, whether we're literal artists that paint or make movies.
