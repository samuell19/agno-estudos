Eh, fuckin' Russians, what do they want? - Having a problem with one of these mail order brides. - What happened? - It seems like over the last year, one of these broads married five different dopes. Took them for 10 grand each, and then [imitates air whooshing] flew to coop, went right back to Russia. - So? They imported those broads, that's their problem. - No, no, Tony, [chuckles] it's our problem. One of the dopes... Jackie the Viking. Jackie's adding to the headache, he's got a big mouth. - Whatever happened to good ol' fashion fucking romance! That's what they get. Trying to buy a wife. What the fuck? - So what do you wanna do? - Let Jackie know we're on the job. - And what do we tell the Russians? - Oh, what I wanna do is let them vodka-guzzling shims take care of their own shit. They might get insulted if we don't do anything. I mean, 50 grand, it's not even our money. I'm not gonna get sick over this. We'll do whatever they want. - I'm sick of this bullshit, Tommy! Dealing with these idiots, doing this petty shit! I'm doing the same thing since I'm 12 years old. - You deserve more responsibilities. I know a horse that's going off at 20 to 1. - So? - So, what was the take from Buddha? - About five grand. - So I say, we take that five grand and dump it all on this horse. - For what? - Think about it, instead of walking in there with five Gs, you show up with 100 grand. - Oh, Tommy, I don't know, I'm- - Listen to yourself! I'm sick of this petty bullshit, I deserve more responsibilities, ugh. You're all talk. The fix is in. You show your uncle Tony you can make money instead of just delivering it, then he'll show you some respect. - Back in Russia, I was the number one Russian roulette champion, '95, '96.

Your English sounds like it's getting better. - [chuckles] I trying. - Alright, let's go right to the point, Pavel. You got a problem that needs our attention. - I agree. - Mail out of brides can't steal from their husbands, especially if their husbands work for me. That makes you look bad, that makes me look bad. - I agree. What we gonna do? - What do you wanna do? - Well, I don't know. What do you want to do? - Well, the first thing we have to do is find the broad. - Broad? - Yeah. A broad. - A, abroad? - Yeah. A broad. - Abroad? - A broad! - Oh, yeah. Abroad. Hold on. This crazy bastard wants to go abroad and find her. What do I do? - [spits] Remember, [spits] respect. - Uh-huh.

Motherfuckin' incoherent Russian cocksucker! - Anthony, remember, stress kills. - Okay then, we go to Russia. - Okay then, we go to Russia. Who you wanna send? One of your best men, I'm sure. - Pavel, I'm gonna do one better, I'm gonna send my own flesh and blood. My nephew, Anthony. - Wow, that is very impressive. You guys must be mad to send a relative? - Nobody with the Santini family and gets away with it. - Well, I see that, they wanna try. - You? - Don't worry, girls. - Well, we have the son of the number one guy in Moscow, to make your nephews trip more pleasant and safe, we will send him. His name is Ivan. Send your nephew over, and they can meet. - Okay. - Da. [man laughing] [guns fires] [girls shriek] [rubble thudding] [playful curious music] - What a break. We don't lose anybody good, and we get rid of my nephew, Anthony. Even he can't make Russia any worse than it already is. [laughing] [Whiner laughing] [determined music] - Go! - Come on, come on!

[chuckles] - Have I got a surprise for you. - I have a surprise for you too. - I'm gonna tell you mine first. - Well, after you hear mine, you might not wanna tell me yours. - Hey, Hey, before you guys start surprising each other, gimme the take from Buddha to Brow. Come on, give me the take. You know, you're the last one. - That's my surprise, um... Me and Tommy took the money we got from Buddha, and we lost it all, five grand. [chuckles] - Mm-hmm. [playful foreboding music] Come here. I forgive you. - You do? - Yeah. I mean, we all make mistakes. Even I made one once. [both chuckle] But you showed me a different side of you, Anthony. You showed me you have balls and you're willin' to take a chance. - I did? - Yeah, you did, and I respect that. - You do? - That's why I have a very important job for you. Remember the Russians we were dealing with? - Yeah, about those mail order brides. - It turns out that that bride robbed a few of the guys, and one of those guys came from us. - Bastard! - Yeah. Now, it makes us look like a, like a bunch of pussies if we don't do something about it, right? - Right! - Okay, and we can't let those commie bastards think that we're a bunch of pussies, Right? - Right! How do I fit in? - Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna send you to Russia to represent the family. - Oh my God. - I want you to find this broad and bring back the money. [playful foreboding music] You know what I always say? - [Both] Don't trust broads. - Make me proud, Anthony. - You got it, Uncle Tony. [gentle bright music] - Here she is. Bitch! - Wow, she is a knockout. - Yeah, I know. She's pretty fuckin' hot. God, but don't let that fool ya, she's just a con artist with tits. - Hey, I know my job. Find the broad, bring back the money. - I don't care about money, I want her. You bring her back to me, you can keep my part of the money and I'll throw in 50 large. - It's the respect, baby! [upbeat music] [crowd cheering] - We got a deal? - Deal. - Okay. You fuckin'. - I can't believe your uncle wasn't pissed about yesterday's take. - Me either. - Nah, and he gives you the sweet-ass job of goin' to Russia. - He said I have balls bigger than his head. - Hey, I told ya. You should listen to me more often, I know what I'm talkin', huh? - You're right. When you're right, you're right. - I'm telling, man, you're gonna have a sweet-ass time going over there, drinking vodka, skiing, getting laid. You know, I heard the broads over there so poor, they give you a hand job for a pair of socks. - Hey, no way, man, this is my shot, I can't blow this. I'm going there strictly on business. - All right. Well, if you're gonna go to Russia, we should stop by Tootie's and get you some new rags. - Hey, that's a good idea.

That you thought I was some patsy you could take for some fat cash? - Okay, at first, I admit, at first, that was my plan. But then, I got to know you, okay? And you were so different from anyone else. I never met anybody like you. And you're so innocent, and genuine, and sincere, and so funny.

Our parents died 10 years ago. So I basically raised her since she was a baby. And she needed a heart operation or she was going to die. [Nina sighs] And I knew I couldn't make the money here, and couldn't steal it from here either, so I went to the US and do what I had to do to get the money. She means everything in the world to me. [girls speaking Russian] - I really do love you. [both chuckle] - My whole life, I've been screwing up. - [chuckles] I understand. - And the one time I get a chance to redeem myself... I fell in love. - Is that so bad? - Everybody back home is gonna think I'm such a loser if I don't come home with that money. - Who cares about them? What if I told you I know where to make $50,000 and even more? - I thought you said you couldn't steal from here? - I couldn't steal from here, but, um, that doesn't mean you couldn't. - Go ahead. - My friend, Ingrid, is a teller at the Bank of Moscow, and she said every month an American comes in to pick up a cash payment. Since Russian companies can't wire money under their own names directly to the US, they hire these Americans to set up US corporations for them. Once a month, one of these Americans comes here to pick up their salaries in cash. It's always a different time. The guy presenting letter, which I have a copy of, and the bank director is instructed to hand over the briefcase. Take one briefcase, walk out, be calm and be pleasant. He's due at two o'clock, you have to be in and out by 1:55. [suspenseful music] [mysterious music] Okay, you got it. - It's 2 Million. Look. - What are you doing? That's crazy! Okay, you have to give this to me. - What? - Give it to me. - Oh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. - They're looking for an American with a briefcase, okay? You do not blend in here, I do. [alarm bell ringing] Okay, we do not have time to argue, just give it to me. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. You meet me later. - Where do you want me to meet you? - Ninth column at the Bolshoi Theatre. At midnight! [Ivan speaking Russian] [phone ringing] Hello? Speak to me. It worked! You have it? Good.

You, you found Nina? - Yeah, but Nina wasn't Nina, Nina was butterfly, and she spent the money on a heart, and she made me rob a bank, and now I'm being chased all over Moscow by the KGB! - Pavel, he will kill you. Tell me where you are and I'm gonna come and get you. - I don't know where I am! Look, I'm supposed to meet her at midnight! - Midnight.
