When you wish upon a star Your dreams come true Isn't that a catchy little tune? Well, how do? Cricket's the name. Jiminy Cricket, to be precise. And I'm here to tell you one humdinger of a tale. It's a story that begins a long time ago. Actually, it's a story that begins once upon a time, a long time ago. That's right. Much better. Much more precise. Never understood that expression. How can it be "once upon a time"? Hey, who's telling this story? Me or you? Well, who are you? I'm you. Only older and wiser. Really? How do you figure? Because I'm the narrator telling this story post facto. I know exactly what's gonna happen to you on this adventure. Really? Well, let me ask you this. Am I ever gonna be warm again? Just keep walking. You'll find out. Some storyteller you are. Shall I continue? Go for it. Narrate to your heart's content. Thank you. Once upon a time, a long time ago, my travels took me to a quaint little village. "Mastro Geppetto. Wood-carver, fabricator of clocks, toys, oddments." Oddments, huh? Sounds like my kind of place. Hmm. Huh? "Maybe something here "A touch behind the ear "Not a boy. Just a toy for a puppeteer" Huh? "Thinking way back when I'm missing him again" "Heart so young, songs unsung "Oh, what might have been" "I see him in my dreams So perfectly, it seems "If I could only make These dreams come true "I may never find "This vision in my mind "Memory may hold the key "To feeling how I felt when he was here with me" There was so much laughter But we couldn't see Happily ever after was never meant to be If only this could be more than a memory But memory will have to be The way this old man's eyes can see Just how it really was When he was here With me Yeah. Hmm. Not too shabby. Whoa! Excuse me, ma'am. Well... Ha. Ah... Figaro, all finished. What do you think, huh? Oh, really? Well, I think he looks very much like him. Very much. No, Figaro, it's Signore Rizzi again. No, Signore Rizzi, I'm sorry. We have already closed at 6:04. Precisely at sunset. Oh, well, Geppetto, I'm sorry to disturb you. I saw your light was on and I thought I would ask you one more time. Please sell me the cuckoo clock with the cute duck and the little alligator on it. That clock is not for sale, as I have told you many times. I will give you 20 lira. 30 lira. Name your price, Geppetto, and I will pay. They are beyond price, Signore. I'm very sorry, but I cannot sell you any of my cuckoo clocks. But if you cannot sell your clocks, why do you have a shop? It's complicated. Perhaps a music box? Good night, Geppetto. I leave a disappointed man. They just don't understand, do they, Cleo? My clocks, they mean everything to me. My clocks are my most special creations. I made them for my beloved Constanza, and she loved every one of them. Every one of them. Oh. But never as much as she loved you, my dear boy. Hmm. My dear boy. No more of these sad thoughts, huh? Time for some happiness. This is why I gave you a smile. So that you will always be happy. What is your name? You should have a name of your own. Yes, yes. Now, what should it be? What should it be? I carved you out of wood. I made you out of pine. You're a boy made out of pine. Pine-occhio. Pine-occhio. Pinocchio. Huh? Pinocchio. Yeah. Uh... Do... Do you approve of the name "Pinocchio"? Yes, yes. You see, Figaro. Do you love the name "Pinocchio"? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Ow! Hey! Hey. No! Oh, let's dance. Whoa! Ow! You call this music? Don't you be afraid, Figaro. No. No. Why? Because he likes you. Oh! Oh! Figaro, no, no. Even Cleo thinks he's very, very handsome. Figaro, come. Don't be such a scaredy cat! Oh, Figaro. What? Oh. Oh. Yes, yes. Almost time, but... Wait for it. Wait for it. Yes. Yeah. Now, it is time for bed. Yes. Good night, Cleo, ah, my little water baby. Good night. Good night, my beautiful birthday boy. Oh. Oh, what a beautiful clear night. Ah! Beautiful. Figaro, look at Pinocchio there in the moonlight. He looks almost like a real boy. Look, Figaro. Look, look, look. It's... It's the wishing star. Oh! I haven't seen one in so... We should make a wish, huh? Yeah? Star light, star bright. First star I see tonight. I wish... Hmm. I wish... How do I say this? I wish... I wish... I wish... Figaro, do you want to know what I wished for? I wished... No, no. If I was to tell you, you would think I was... The problem with that one clock, it talks too much. Get it? Get it? It talks too much. Tick-tock, the clock tick-tocks too much? Ah. never mind. It's late. Still, If my wish came true, Figaro, that would be wonderful. Wonderful. Jumpin' jeepers. He's alive. Now see here. What's this all about? - Holy moly. You can walk. - "Holy moly. You can walk." Shut my mouth. You can talk. "Shut my mouth. You can talk." - No, you can talk. - "No, you can talk." - I know I can talk. And so can you. - "I know I can talk. And so can you." All right, all right. All right, all right, all right. Everyone can relax. I'm here now. What seems to be the... Oh, yes. I see what the problem is. As I live and breathe. A fairy! You're not really real, are you? Of course he's real! He's alive, isn't he? - And who might you be? - Jiminy Cricket. Bug, boulevardier, flâneur, man of leisure. And who might you be? Oh, the good Geppetto made a wish from the depths of his heart and so I'm here. - I'm the Blue Fairy. - "I'm the Blue Fairy." - No, I'm the Blue Fairy. - "No, I'm the Blue Fairy." Oh, I see what the problem is here. - Let's try this again. I'm the Blue Fairy. - Hello, Blue Fairy! That's more like it. Yes, I'm the Blue Fairy. - Now, what's your name? - I don't know. I heard Geppetto name him Pinocchio. My name is Pinocchio. Sounds like your head is made of white pine. Hence, Pinocchio. The perfect name for a boy with a wooden head. - I'm a boy? - Well, a wooden boy. Geppetto, who lies thither sawing wood, he's the wood-carver, I assume? Yes, I guess you could call him Pinocchio's pops. - "Pops"? - Yeah, Pops. Pappy. You know, father. I mean, that is, if Pinocchio here was a real boy. If Geppetto wanted a real boy, why would he carve a puppet? Well, sure, there are other ways to make a boy, but I don't think Geppetto gets out much, and I guess it's the best he could do with the tools he's got. Of course, I'm just a talking cricket, so I'm not one to pass judgment on what's real. - Ms. Blue Fairy, am I real? - Yes, Pinocchio, you're real, all right. A real, live, living puppet that's painted to look like a real, live, living boy. Almost what your father wished for. So when do I become a real, real, live, living boy? Because it sounds like that's what will make my father happy. "Little puppet made of pine Geppetto's wish went up the line "But his feelings were tangled And knotted like twine "Then light from a star gave life to a toy A marionette boy full of wonder and joy "But to be truly real He had to pass an ordeal" Geppetto has done his part, and I have done mine. And to be real is up to you. You have to prove that you are brave, truthful and unselfish. How do I do that? Well, by learning to choose between right and wrong. - Okay, but how do I do that? - Your conscience will tell you. "Con Shuns"? Who are they? No, no. "Conscience." Abstract, noun, singular. A conscience is that still small voice that most people refuse to listen to. And that is the entire problem with the world today. Are you my conscience? Huh? Me? No, I'm not a conscience. I'm a cricket. More of an insect than an instinct. Would you like to be his conscience? Me? No, thanks. I've, uh, got enough on my plate. Oh, really? I see a lost soul, an insect of no fixed address. An aimless vagabond hopping from hearth to hearth with no direction, no job, no prospects and no purpose in life. Now look here. Just because a fella sneaks into somebody's house to warm his backside, and sure, he might have gotten kicked out of a place or two, but... - Okay, you have a point. - Here's the thing. Do you know the difference between right and wrong? You're darn tootin', I do. I consider myself a bug of high moral standards, no matter what you may have heard. Well, that settles it then. Kneel, Mr. Cricket. I hereby appoint you Pinocchio's conscience. - Uh, temporary conscience. - Sure. Temporary conscience. Until such time as Pinocchio may grow his own. Henceforth, you are the high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong, and a trusted counselor during moments of temptation. Arise, Sir Jiminy Cricket. Hey! This is more like it. "Let your job restore your pride And let your conscience be your guide "For now, my dear Pinocchio The time has come for me to go" Oh, boy. She's rhyming again. Looks like we're about to be on our own. Pinocchio, when a boy is brave, truthful and unselfish, it makes his father proud. And the most important part about being real isn't what you're made of. It's about what's in your heart. Fate is kind She brings to those who love The sweet fulfillment of Their secret longing Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and sees you through When you wish upon a star Your dreams Come true What was that? I heard something. I heard something. I heard something. Figaro, Figaro, did you hear something, too? I heard something. You? Did you... Did you hear something, Figaro? I heard something. Yes, I did. I heard. I heard something. What about you? Cleo, did you hear anything? - Pinocchio, did you hear anything? - I sure did! All right. I heard something, too. And now that you can talk... Hello, Pops. It's me, Pinocchio! - You talk! - Yeah. And I can walk. How? How can you walk? How can you talk? The Blue Fairy. She said you made a wish. Blue Fairy? The Blue Fairy! I did make a wish. I wished... I wished that my... I know. A real boy. But guess what? I'm almost a real boy, and I can become one. All I have to do is, uh... A bunch of stuff. An almost real boy? An almost real boy. Uh-huh. An almost real boy! An almost real boy! Look... Look at you. Look. Look at you! You are an almost real boy! We can be... We can be a family. Oh, an almost real boy! Oh! We must have music. Dance. Can you dance, Pinocchio? I'll design The perfect wooden shoe And then we'll sing and dance The whole day through If you get splinters I'll be there with glue I'll take care of you Yes, I will Pinocchio, Pinocchio Holy smoke-io Pinocchio, Pinocchio My dear son made of wood Pinocchio, Pinocchio I think you... May I? Thank you. Much obliged. And you think it is good And so Pinocchio became part of Geppetto's little family. And despite a few minor blended family issues... ...they became a stable, well-adjusted household. Pinocchio! Pinocchio, I have been thinking. Maybe it is time for you to go to school. Really, Father? Really? Whoa! Father, what's that big shining thing? Oh! That's... That is the sun, my son. It goes around the Earth once a day. It's basic, simple science. You'll learn all about it in school. Ah! And here are your new schoolmates, and, ah, Signora Vitelli. Buongiorno. Geppetto. Oh, oh, oh, Pinocchio! Wait, wait. Figaro, yes. It's been so long, I nearly forgot it. This is your lesson book. And this is an apple for your teacher. Now turn around. Let me get a look at you. Oh. Very handsome, very handsome. Now, Pinocchio. This town can be very confusing. There are many, many curving streets, so pay attention. And if you get lost, just remember we are two streets down from the fountain. I'll come straight home right after school. I will be right here when you get back. And we will eat dinner precisely at the stroke of 5:00. Got it, Father. The stroke of 5:00. That's right. There you go. Oh! Oh, no! No. Ah! Figaro, Figaro, no. Off he goes. My boy. Ah! Well, buongiorno, Sofia. Ah! I have some very good garbage for you. Ah, there we are. Mmm. Yum-yum-yum-yum! Mmm! You miss him already, don't you? Yes. Well, yes. I miss him, too. Already, yes. Figaro, do you miss him? Yes? Yes? Well, going to school, it will be good for him. School? Jumpin' jeepers. What time is it? First real day on the job and I'm already late! Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Calm down. I don't like bugs. Too much work. I prefer garbage. Thanks, I guess. That's a relief. I thought I was a goner for sure. - Cricket's the name. Jiminy Cricket. - Nice to meet you. I'm Sofia. So you're new in town. It's a great little... Excuse me, Sofia. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm Pinocchio's conscience, and I overslept. Could you do me a giant favor and airlift me to the school? Asleep on the job, huh? Who knew they were outsourcing conscience work? - Back in my day... - Sofia, I really need to get to him. This little puppet is running around loose on the streets without a conscience. Can you imagine the trouble he's gonna get into? Well, I wouldn't want that on my conscience. Okay, Mr. Right or Wrong. Hold on to your hat. Well, well, well. Stromboli! So that old rascal's back in town. Gideon, remember the time I tied strings on you and passed you off as a puppet? Remember when he found out? How he beat... Oh. Gideon, listen. The merry laughter of innocent children wending their way to school. Their thirsty minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge. School, a noble institution. What would this stupid world be without it? Well, look at that. A wooden boy. A wooden boy! Look at that, Gideon. It's amazing. A living puppet without strings! Ugh. Gideon, a thing like that could be worth a fortune to someone. Let me see. Who would pay for a living... That's it. Stromboli! He'll give his eye teeth for that thing. I can't wait to get to school and learn what all this stuff is. Quick. We'll cut him off. Oh! Oh, oh, God. Oh, oh, my, my. How clumsy of me. I am terribly sorry. - I do hope you're not injured? - Injured? Damaged, broken, irreparably splintered beyond repair. I'm not broken. Thank heavens. You must be constructed of pretty sturdy oak. I'm pine. That's why I'm called... Yes, pine. Well, we can't all be constructed of quality lumber. Well, well. Quite the scholar, I see. A man of letters. I presume you're on your way to lecture at the science academy? No. I'm going to school so I can learn a bunch of stuff to be a real boy and make my father proud. A real boy? Why on earth would you want to be real when you can be famous? - Famous? - Yes, famous. I'm speaking of the theater. Bright lights. Music. Applause. Fame! Fame? But I want to be real. Yes, yes, my boy. But did you know, many people say that you're not actually real until everybody knows about you? Why, to be famous is to be real. Until then, you're just a nobody. Do you want to be a nobody? No! Nobody wants to be a nobody. Everybody who's anybody wants to be a somebody. But my father said I should go to school. Of course he did. All parents say that. But he doesn't recognize your genius. Who needs an education when one has such a personality, such a profile, such a physique? Why, he is a natural born actor. Right, Gideon? And not just an actor. An entrepreneur. Nay, an influencer. And won't your father be proud? - Really? - Oh, of course he will. Why, he'll see your name in lights. Lights six feet high! - Say, what is your name? - Pinocchio. Pinocchio. P-I-N-O... Probably a K. Never mind. Too many letters. We need a simple, strong stage name. Slab Oakley. Chad Log. I've got it. Chris Pine. No, it'd never work. We are wasting precious time. Do you want to make your father proud or not? - I sure do. - Well, then? - Okay, I'll be famous. - Capital! Hi-diddle-dee-dee An actor's life for me A high silk hat and a silver cane A watch of gold with a diamond chain Hi-diddle-dee-dee An actor's life is gay It's great to be a celebrity An actor's life for me Oh, there. I see him. Straight ahead. 12 o'clock. Pardon me, folks. Pardon me. Passing through. Thanks, Sofia. What? Jiminy, what are you doing up there? What? Who? Who are we talking to? What is a Jiminy? Wait, wait. I can't... It's where? Where are you looking? Are you saying that... Jiminy, guess what? I don't need to go to school. I'm gonna be famous instead. And that'll make Father proud. All right. Now calm down, son. Remember what I said about temptation? Well, that's him. Oh, no, that's Mr. Honest John. He's my agent. Honest John? Pinokes, as a rule of thumb, when somebody calls themselves "honest," they ain't. Especially, if they're an agent. So having just been duly assigned to you as your conscience, I'm telling you, forget all these big-headed ideas about being famous and get to school. That's what your father wants you to do. But Honest John said my father wants me to be famous. Well, it's like I said, kiddo. Honest John ain't. But you said if somebody says they're honest, they aren't. - Who am I supposed to believe? - Well, that is the age-old question. But I'd trust the guy the Blue Fairy assigned to the case. Wouldn't you? - Jiminy Cricket, temporary conscience? - Well, then, I want to go to school. Now we're talking. School's that-a-way. Hey, Pinoke. Drop the mallet. Oof! Hold up here, Pinoke. Boy, they ought to do something about all the loose gravel on this road. One of these days, a heavy wagon wheel's gonna fling one of these rocks and hurt somebody. - What in Sam Hill do we pay taxes for? - What are taxes? Nothing you need to worry about, now that you won't be famous. But here's what you do need to know about school. One, pay attention. Two, obey all the rules. And three, do whatever the teacher tells you to do. - Got it? - Got it. - Aren't you coming with me? - Uh, no, Pinoke. Most schools don't take kindly to insects. They lump me in with wasps, cockroaches and termites. I'll be waiting for you here when school lets out. - Get you home by the stroke of 3:17. - Okay, Jiminy. Whoa! See what I mean? He's a good kid, right? And here's the good news. It seems Pinocchio is serious about becoming brave, truthful and unselfish. And he listened to his conscience. I bet you were thinking I dropped the ball. But old Jiminy picked up the fumble and it's smooth sailing from here. Out! Get out. Get out and stay out. School is for real children. Not ridiculous puppets. Puppets belong in the puppet show. Ah, come on. Well, I'll be. Hey. What's the big idea? Get me out of here! Let me out. This is an outrage, an atrocity. I don't think that teacher likes me. Oh, who cares what he thinks? His pedagogy is completely outdated. Is his curriculum child-led? Brain-based for a growth mindset? I think not. He makes no room for different learning styles. He said I didn't belong. All the kids laughed at me. Of course they did. Puppets make people laugh. Oh, you poor, poor misunderstood boy. Don't you see? You don't fit in a traditional educational environment. You are misunderstood, just like every great actor who ever walked the earth. School is for ordinary, humdrum, common, boring, silly little children! Not brilliant artists like yourself. It's fame you want. Fame and fortune. - But my father... - Wanted you to go to school and you did. You went to school. You gave it the old college try. And what did the wise and learned schoolmaster say? He said I belong in a puppet show. Alas, a puppet show. I rest my case. - Now we're talking! - No! To Stromboli's. Fame awaits! Hi-diddle-dee-dee An actor's life for me A wax mustache and a beaver coat A pony cart and a billy goat Hi-diddle-dee-dum An actor's life is fun You wear your hair in a pompadour You ride around in a coach-and-four You stop and buy out a candy store An actor's life for me... No. Pinocchio, don't listen to him! No! Don't listen to him, Pinoke. No! Pinoke, no. No! It's 5:00.5:00. Pinocchio should have been home by now. He must have lost his way and... And gotten lost. Well, come on, everyone. Yes. You too, Figaro. Figaro. I haven't left the shop since... Well, but... we have to find Pinocchio. Ladies and gentlemen. To complete the performance of my great show, Stromboli the master showman and the greatest theatrical maestro on the face of the earth... That's me. And by special permission of the management... That's me too. I present to you something that you will absolutely refuse to believe. Introducing the eighth wonder of the world, the only marionette who can sing and dance without the aid of strings. The toy who thinks he's a boy. So it's true. Stromboli got his grubby hands on a magic puppet. You have my condolences. Oh, do you want them back? - You're sweet. - I'm Pinocchio. I'm here to be famous so I can be a real boy and then make my father proud. And I'm Fabiana, and I'm never gonna be famous. Not unless I can figure some way out of this two-bit, small-time sad excuse for a puppet show. Never mind. I'm just having a rough day. Sorry. - Why do I have strings? - Part of the show. One of Stromboli's last-minute brainstorms. See? Slip knots. You haven't met Sabina yet, have you? I think you two could be friends. She looks like she has strong legs. Your legs look sturdy, too. Are they made of pine? Yeah. But soon they're gonna be real. Give them a try tonight. - Break a leg. - Really? No, not really. Oh. Did you hurt your leg? It's a long story, but it gets better every day. The only marionette who can sing and dance without the aid of strings. The toy who thinks he's a boy. The one and only Pinocchio! I've got no strings To hold me down To make me fret, or make me frown... Stupid puppet. Once more. I've got no strings To hold me down To make me fret, or make me frown I had strings, but now I'm free There are no strings on me Hi-ho, the merry-o That's the only way to be I want the world to know Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings, so I have fun I'm not tied up to anyone They've got strings But you can see there are no strings on me There are no strings on me Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Grazie. Grazie. Thank you. I may not be a ballerina But I'll always dance And I may not sway in partner But I'll know romance Half-human, half-marionette I'm practicing my pirouette I'll move without apology And every step will set me free I will always dance and dream of my plié They'll see with just one glance Me land a grand jeté They'll smile and they'll all talk I'll still need help to walk But I will always Dance Start with the tango and then the salsa And there's the rumba And then we cha-cha-cha The Paso doble, the quickstep The two-step, the foxtrot Merengue, bachata, the mambo, the bomb a The plena, the samba The kathak, kabuki and more All you need is your feet And a beat and the floor You'll find your flow And that's when you let go Let it go like a child And be free and be wild Just do can-cans, not can'ts Like the girls do in France What's this nonsense? Nobody in my show performs for free. Now pack. We leave in an hour. And you... Ooh, ooh, ooh. My little Pinocchio. I was scared to death you got lost or stolen. And we wouldn't want that now, would we? In an hour we go. - There. - Let me go. Let me out of here. - This will be your home. - Help! - Where I can find you. Always. - Oh, no. No, no! Yes, yes. To me you are belong. Let me go. Let me out of here. Help! Father! Father? No parent wants a bizzaria like you. No, no! Parents want a real kid. Jiminy. Father. Help! Help! Oh, no. Help! Please. My little wooden gold mine. Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Geppetto. I'm here inside this jar! - Pinocchio! - Geppetto! Geppetto! Pinocchio! Oh, Figaro, Cleo, where can he be? Pinocchio! Geppetto! Psst. Psst. Pinocchio. Pinocchio. I'm up here. In the ceiling. Stromboli is a horrible, mean man. But we're going to help you. Leave me alone. We're going to figure out a way to get you out of that cage. Did you hear what I said? We're going to help you. Pinocchio, look at me. You can trust me. You're a real person, and the only real person I can believe is my father. I like the way you dance. We haven't been formally introduced. I'm Sabina. I'm Pinocchio. Thank you for getting my nose unstuck. Well, you know what they say. The show must go on. - You're a wonderful dancer. - Thank you. It's too bad we have to meet under these awful circumstances. Mr. Stromboli said I could go home and tell my father I got famous. But then he locked me up. Ah! So now you don't trust anybody? Well, I trust you. Sort of. Thank you. I'll try to be worthy of it. You see that key hanging on the wall? That's the key to this cage. We have to get it somehow and get you out of here. But that could get you in trouble. Pinocchio, can I trust you with something? When we get to the next village, we puppets and puppeteers are going to take back the money Stromboli stole from us and escape. - Escape? - Yes. Run away. And then we're going to start our own show. And we will treat all the members of our troupe fairly and kindly, and... What's going on in here? Pinocchio. My little Pinocchio. Are you okay? You should get some rest. Tomorrow we have a big show in Siena. The Sienese love puppets. They will give us lots of money. Just to be sure there is no funny business. Except on stage. Then lots of funny business. Well, I guess this is it. This is how it ends. Starving to death in a pickle jar. No, sirree. I thought I'd live to be 103. Of course, this never would've happened if I hadn't gotten into the conscience business. As I live and breathe. Stromboli's puppet show. I wonder if Pinoke ever got a chance to... Pinoke! Hey, Pinocchio. Over here. It's Jiminy! I can't believe it. We're so close and yet so far. Whoa! Well, I'll be. Psst. Pinocchio. Pinocchio. Listen up. Jiminy. Gee, am I glad to see you. Stromboli locked me in this cage. Locked solid. Well, Pinoke, I guess this isn't what you signed up for when you decided to be a famous actor, is it? It's not my fault. I never wanted to be famous. Sorry, kiddo. That's not the way I remember it. But I didn't want to be famous. I wanted to go to school. - Hey. - It's true. All of those people cheering and applauding. I hated it. - Whoa! - What's happening, Jiminy? Looks like some sort of fairy magic. Kind of on the nose, if you ask me. But the point is, a lie can really change a person, Pinokes. Which is why I'm telling you the 110% most honestly honest, truthiest truthiness ever. Believe me. Oops. Okay, that last part wasn't true. But everything I said up until then was. Jiminy, you okay? More or less. Now quit telling those whoppers. Jiminy, you see that key? Uh-huh. Yeah, I do. That's the key to this cage lock. Can you reach it? Impossible. No way I can reach that. Hey, Jiminy. You want to know something? I don't want to be a real boy. Ow! Whoa! Oh, Jiminy, are you okay? Yeah, but tell me, was that a real fib or a fib fib? Of course it wasn't a real fib. I had to reach the key. I'm sorry, Jiminy. Pinoke, remember what the Blue Fairy said? It's not about what you're made of on the outside. Being real is in your heart. That's what being real is all about. But thank you for the apology. Jiminy, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you outside of school. Gotcha. Thanks, Pinoke. Now, swing me towards the lock. Almost. Bull's-eye! Ah-ha! Hot dog! We did it. Yeah, hot dog. What's that? No time to explain charcuterie, pal. - Now, let's get you home. - Yeah. I've met some really nice people, Jiminy. They helped me and they didn't even have to. Well, that's what friends do. One of them was a puppet like me. Her name was Sabina. I see. A puppet friend. Sort of a peer. So peers are friends? Well, not all the time, Pinokes. You've got to be careful, because sometimes when peers get in a group, they like to pressure... Jiminy? Where'd he go? Ow! Blimey! Look what we've just fished up off the bleeding street. A little wooden boy! Look at him. He's made out of wooden slats. I'm Lampwick. What's your name, Slats? - My name's Pinocchio. - Pinocchio? - Pinocchi-who? - Pinocchio. So what's your story, Slats? Why you made out of wood? Because I'm a puppet. But I can be a real boy. Oh, I must say, for a puppet, you are very clever indeed. Only the smartest young lads know about the collection. Collection? What collection? The collection for The Island, you blockhead. You have to be on a deserted crossroads after dark. You were on the corner, so you got collected. Come on. Oh. Okay. But I need to find my conscience. Conscience? What's so funny? You. Your conscience is the last thing you want to take to Pleasure Island. Pleasure Island? Is that where you're going? You bet your sweet patootie that's where we're going. It's the greatest joy joint in the world. No cops, no parents, no rules. You can tear the place apart and nobody says a word. Did I hear you correctly? You would like to be changed, transformed, so to speak? Yes. Well, it's very fortunate that you're coming with us, because Pleasure Island will be the most life-altering experience you will ever have. You won't be a puppet anymore, that's for sure. Really? Aye. Cross my heart and hope to die. Well, Mr. Coachman, it sure sounds fun. But I don't trust you. What! - Ow! - What? Well, kids, it seems we have a doubter in our midst. A killjoy who apparently doesn't believe in having fun. I mean, who doesn't believe in transformative experiences? Shall we all turn tail and go running back to Mommy and Daddy? No! Look, you kids go. I'll go another time. Oh, I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way. It's only peer pressure Unless you're not a peer If you won't be like all these kids There's nothing for you here Don't trust me Trust all of them The time has come Don't cut and run It's sink or swim Do or die Are you with us on this ride? Now you must decide Don't be a party pooper Afraid of having fun It's all for one and one for all The game is on Don't drop the ball You take the fall And ruin it for everyone Yeah. -Real boys always want more -CHILDREN: Always want more And real girls always like The real boys more Talking all this nonsense About a so-called conscience You're not gonna need that anymore What a bore. So play, play Time to play All your troubles melt away Play, play Time to play Now it's time to play So tell us what you say Okay, then. I say we all... go. Yeah! All right, then. Pleasure Island awaits. Hyah! Whoa! Pinocchio. No! Welcome to Pleasure Island! Come right inside. - Enjoy the ride and see the show. - Get on the boat! Come on. There's so much fun here to keep you smiling. And no one is ever gonna tell you "No." Look at that, Slats. Whoa. - Root beer! - Root beer. - Look! Free root beer! - Root beer! Here you go, gents. Have a tall one. They're on the house. Better yet, have two. Bottoms up! So much root beer! Yes! A life supply of root beer! I know! Look at all that root beer! Hey, give me that root beer! That kid's crazy. Ouch. Whoa! Hey! Whoo-hoo! Whoa! Great move, Pinoke. Whoa! Look at them kids. They're swiping everything out of that joint. Give me that. Push it! Hey, Slats. Whoa! That jerk got a fire lit under him, that's for sure! Hey, I like these guys. Hey, Slats, we got to come back here and bust up some clocks. They look like my father's clocks. Oh, yeah? Watch this. Bull's-eye! - You're up, Slats. - No, thanks. Something tells me my father might not be too happy if he knew I was here. Talking all this nonsense About a so-called conscience You're not gonna need that anymore So play, play Play, play Time to play It was wrong of me to send him off to school like a real boy. Never should have done that. Never. What in blazes? Oh, Sofia, is that you? What? What does this mean? "Pleasure Island." Pleasure Island? Is this where Pinocchio is? Oh, my goodness. This is a serious crisis. A catastrophe! Oh! Now we're talking. Am I great or what? It's awfully quiet. Where do you suppose all the kids went, Lampy? They're around here somewhere. What do you care? They're all losers anyway. Four in the corner. Oh! Look at that. Another perfect shot, if I do say so myself. Huh. I wonder where everybody is. What the cuss is that all about? Ap-cray! Scratched it. Something wrong with the table. It's tilted or something. Okay, Slats. Your shot. Hey, Slats. There's something I've been meaning to ask you. How come you didn't bust any of them cuckoo clocks? Any real kid would love to smash those clocks. It just didn't feel right. Listen to Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. Well, I guess you ain't transformed into a complete jerk yet. I don't want to be a jerk. I want to be a real boy. The way you're going, you might make it to half a real boy. It looks to me like you still got a conscience inside of you. I wish I still did have a conscience. Pinocchio! What's with all the donkeys? Oh, brother. It's like I've dropped into H-E-double hockey sticks. Let's move it, you scum. The sooner these donkeys get to the salt mines, the sooner I get paid. I still say it's not right to yell right as somebody's about to make a shot. Get over it. Everybody knows psyching out your opponent is a great strategy. You gotta do what you gotta do to win. You're wrong, Lampy. I still call what you did cheating. Come on. To hear you talk, you'd think something terrible was gonna happen to us. Conscience, right. What a crock. Uh, Lampy, you might want to check your... Who do I look like to you? A jackass? You sure are... Hey, you sound just like a donkey... Did that come out of me? Uh-huh. Help! Somebody help me. I've been double-crossed. I've been played! Help me, please! Anybody! Anybody, please! Just call anybody! Help me, please. Mama! Mama! Oh, no. What's happening? What do I do? Help! Help! Jiminy! Jiminy! Jiminy! Jiminy! Pinoke, let's get out of here. The kids, they're all turning into donkey... Oh, no! You too? Oh. These brats. There's that wooden boy. Get him! Whoa! Jiminy, let's go. You said it, Pinoke. Let's skedaddle out of here. There they go! Faster! Don't let them get to the sea. Whoa! Oh, no. We're trapped. No, we're not. Positive thinking, Jiminy. Go! Bollocks. Wooden donkey would have been worth a bleeding fortune. Somebody's dropped a barrel of salt in this water. You're in the sea, Pinoke. Seawater is salty. - Now swim. Swing those arms. - Like this? Attaboy, Pinoke. Now you're cooking. Let's get out of here. - We don't want to bump into Monstro. - Who's Monstro? A sea monster. He sleeps on top of the water. So big he looks like an island. Land ho! Father? It's me, Pinocchio. I'm home. Maybe he's asleep. Look. All of his clocks are gone. What do you think happened to him? He sailed out to sea. - He sailed out to sea? - He sailed out to sea? That's right. Sailed out to sea. Am I not speaking clearly? - Sofia, how? - How do you think? In a boat. He needed to get to Pleasure Island to look for Pinocchio. So he sold all his clocks and he bought a boat. Those clocks meant everything to him. It's his life's work. Gee. He sold his clocks to find me? That's right, kiddo. You mean more to him than his beloved clocks. More than anything. Let's go. I don't see Geppetto anywhere. I hope I'm wrong, but that sure looks like Stromboli's to me. Quick. Under the pier. Look. It's Sofia. I got an idea. I'll paddle out and see if she knows which way Geppetto went. You keep out of sight. Pinocchio. Sabina? I'm so glad it's you. Look. You've got new ears. Uh, yeah. And a new tail. Pinocchio, we, the members of the New Marionette Family Theater, have a very important proposition. - You started your own puppet show? - We sure did. Last night, the Carabinieri arrested Stromboli and put him in jail. Wow. The New Marionette Family Theater! I like it. But there's more. We would be honored if you would consider joining our show. Really? You want me in your show? Yep, donkey ears and all. And we want you to be the headliner. Really? I can't think of anything more wonderful. But... Uh... I have to stay and find my father. Pinocchio, something tells me the decision you made is the right one. It sure is, Pinoke. I'm proud of you, kiddo. And look. Your donkey ears are gone! Yeah. My donkey ears are gone. And your tail. They're both gone. Well, we've got to get going. Perhaps I'll see you next year when we come back to put on a show in Siena? I hope so. Until next year. And, Pinocchio, please give my best to your father. And mine, too. - When you find him. - When you find him. I sure will. Holy moly! I almost forgot. Sofia said Geppetto left about two hours ago, headed south. She agreed to airlift us so we can search for... Hold on one gosh-darn minute. Let's get something straight here, Mr. Cricket. I said I'd airlift you, not him. I can't carry a heavy block of wood. No offense, kid. - Well, what are we gonna do? - I have an idea. No boats, nothing. Only water as far as the eye can see. We'll find him. Positive thinking. What? Pinoke, what'd she say? Yes, I heard that. But what did you... Sofia? Do you see something? Yep, yep, yep. Pinoke, I see a tiny boat. - A tiny boat? - Yes, a dinghy. - What's a dinghy? - A tiny boat. Geppetto! I see Geppetto! "Gee-pee-to." Geppetto. She sees Father! Geppetto. It's Geppetto! Father. It's me, Pinocchio! Father! Father, it's me, Pinocchio! Father, it's me! Did you hear something, Figaro? Silly me. I thought I heard Pinocchio. I must be day-dreaming. Father! It's me, Pinocchio. Father! Pinocchio? Running on the water? This is a miracle. Pinocchio! Pinocchio! You're back. Yes, Father, I'm back. I'm coming to you. Wait. No. I'm coming to you. It's a miracle. Look at this. You see, Cleo? Cleo, Figaro, look! He can run on water. Well, of course he can run on water. He's made of wood. I'm coming, Pinocchio. Father, I'm sorry I didn't come home after I got kicked out of school. You got kicked out of school? Yes, for being a puppet. So I joined the puppet show and became famous. You became famous? Well, almost famous. I danced in a puppet show and made lots of money. But then I got kidnapped and was locked in a bird cage, so I had to tell a bunch of fibs to Jiminy so my nose would grow so I could escape. But then I got scooped up by a coach full of foolish kids, and was taken to Pleasure Island, where I learned to drink... Uh, I forget what they called it. But anyway, Pleasure Island was bad because I grew donkey ears and was chased by the vapor creatures who wanted to sell me to the salt mines. But Jiminy helped me and we jumped off a cliff into the sea and swam to shore, where we found out you sold all your clocks to buy a boat so you could look for me. And now we're here! You did all that in one day? Yes. My goodness. I haven't done a fraction of that in my whole life. I'm sorry, Father. I apologize for all the trouble I caused. Oh, no, Pinocchio, my boy. All is forgiven. I'm just so happy to see you safe and sound. Now we can go home again and we'll be all together. We'll be one big happy... Monstro! It's Monstro! It's Monstro! Well, I'll be. He's asleep. Wake up! My friend's in there. Open up, you big blubber mouth. Father! Father! Pinocchio! Pinocchio, you got swallowed too? Father! Father! Here. Grab this. Oh, I just hit my boy of wood with a piece of wood. - Oh, Pinocchio. Pinocchio. - Hello, Pops. Pinocchio. Pinocchio, I'm so happy to see you. Oh. So happy to see my boy. Figaro, you're here, too. And Cleo. Yes, yes, we're all together again. Isn't it wonderful? Although, yeah, it is a bit strange to be inside the belly of a whale. But we will make do. It is a bit humid, though, isn't it? Father, I see your boat still floats. Yes, yes. That is a good little boat. So as soon as Monstro opens his mouth, we can sail out of here. Well, I don't know about that, Pinocchio. I mean, look at all this junk. It looks to me like everything comes in, but nothing goes out, except the other way, presumably, but that is not a good option. - Father, what's inside that lantern? - Ironically, whale oil. That's right. And I have an idea. Now! We did it, Father. Look at all that smoke. It's wonderful, I think. Come on, Father. Let's get our boat into position. Open up. I need to get in there. Open up, I say! Open sesame! Well, what do you know? Whoa. Whoa! No, no, no! Oh, no, oh, no, no! Father, look! Oh, oh, oh. Whoa. Oh, oh. Oh, oh! Oh, oh! I think he's beginning to get irritated by the smoke. It must be tickling his nose. Pinoke. Pinoke. Jiminy. Grab on. - Jiminy? Who's Jiminy? - My conscience. That cricket is your conscience? I sure am. And let me tell you, it's no easy job. Get ready, Father. Pinocchio! Father! Father! No! Figaro, Cleo, I've got Father. Pinoke. Jiminy, thank goodness. I thought you were a goner. Look. He sneezed us back toward land. Here he comes! Everybody, hold on! Whoa! Faster, Pinoke, faster! Spin those clodhoppers. You're almost there, Pinoke. Father? Father? Pinoke, you made it. Jiminy, Father looks like he's hurt. I have to help him. You go. I'll catch up. Father? Father, talk to me. Say something. Father, wake up. Father, Figaro is here. And Cleo. They're all here. Don't die, Father. Please don't die. When you wish upon a star Your dreams come... Pinocchio. My boy, you're here? Yes, Father, I'm here. We're all here. Oh. Cleo? Figaro? Figaro, Cleo, you're all here. Oh, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that we had all been swallowed by a whale. Yes, Father. But it wasn't a whale. It was a sea monster, and we got out. Oh! Yes! Yes, we did. Now I remember. You saved us. You swam faster than any clipper ship could sail. No real boy could ever do such a thing. Oh, Pinocchio, you honestly did try with all your heart and that makes you a truthful boy. And you know what else it makes you? Unselfish and very, very brave. Pinocchio, when you first came to me, I might have made you think I wanted somebody else. But it was you I was wishing for. You will always be my real boy. There isn't a single thing I would change about you. I am so very proud of you. And I love you so very much. I love you too, Father. Well, well, we have come quite a long way, haven't we, Son? We sure have, Father. Now let's get you home. Yes, let's get home. Come on, Cleo, Figaro. But... Pinocchio, do you know the way? We'll follow that light. So in the end, Pinocchio did prove himself brave, honest and unselfish. And since then many stories have been told about him. People say he was transformed into an honest-to-goodness real boy. Did that actually happen? Who knows? But I do know one thing for sure. In his heart, Pinocchio is as real as any real boy could ever be. When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you If your heart is in your dream No request is too extreme When you wish upon a star As dreamers do Fate is kind She brings to those who love The sweet fulfillment of Their secret longing Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and sees you through When you wish upon a star Your dreams come true
