- [Narrator] A cause, a belief. Why? Why do we give up so much for them? To feel secure? To give meaning? The sacrifices we make to serve these can shape us in profound ways as we sit in our echo chambers, waiting for an answer that we already know, the deeper we go in search of stillness within the eye of ideology. This, I write for you. (somber eerie music) (dramatic music) (quiet tense music) (quiet eerie music) (traffic whooshing) (knuckles rapping) (dog barking) (door opening) (door clicking) (man throwing up) (radio chattering) - [Father] I'm doing all right. Come on, let's go, you're all right. (man spitting) - [Radio] Please, we want to hear your stories. People are now being told to stay inside. - I'm good. I'm all right, I'm good. - [Radio] Is there any way out of that? Who can describe what is happening everywhere? (man sighs) - [Mother] You all right? - I'm so sorry, Mum. At least I've made it back before the curfew started. Did she sleep at all last night? - [Mother] On and off. (girl crying) (woman moaning) (clock ticking) (girl groaning) - Hey, hey, hey, sh, sh, sh. Hey, hey, hey. We're here, we're here. You okay? - You're okay. - You're all right. You know Grummi Grummi said that you didn't want to sleep in your own bed tonight. Is that right? - Yeah. - You know, do you remember this? Sh, sh, sh. (gentle music) (clock ticking) - [Narrator] It must have been 40 years since she last saw her father. (door thudding) (heartbeat thudding) (dramatic music) You see, fear, bankruptcy, unemployment had taken over. The streets became empty. Something terrible had happened. All children under the age of six had to be separated from their families and placed here for their safety. As they grew up, they were tasked here, deep underground, to find a cure for it. (door buzzing) (doors whooshing) (dramatic music) The rules were simple. Work alone. Focus on the task. Do not go into any restricted areas. Accept instructions without question. She knew it was a small price to pay for the comfort and security that this place brought. (door thudding) She was to send machines to the outside world from deep underground here. Machines that would help find a cure. - [Computer] Enjoy your dinner. Playing comfort music. (gentle music) (woman coughing) (lips smacking) (computer whirring) (computer whirring) (computer whirring) (computer whirring) (footsteps tapping) (computer whirring) (eerie music) As an engineer, she would work on the machines every day from her office. (computer beeping) She would command them and give them instructions. Once they had found a cure, she could go home. (quiet eerie music) (computer beeping) (computer whirring) (computer beeping) (wind whooshing) (engines revving) (engines roaring) (animals snarling) (woman moaning) (woman screaming) (bed creaking) (quiet eerie music) (computer beeping) (computer whirring) (quiet dramatic music) (heartbeat thudding) (quiet eerie music) (computer whirring) (computer whirring) The world, the world out there is grateful to you. You and you alone are power. You are more than you think. Possibilities are endless. The insurmountable feelings of joy you will feel one day, when the task is complete, when you make the world a better place, it's all you. All of this, everything, cannot exist without you. You and you are alone are the true saviors of the world. Giving light to disease and war. The one prepared to go where others would not. We are so proud of all that you are able to achieve. Now imagine that nothing more than your favorite color. How does it make you feel? Happy, content? Good. Now let the color fill your entire body. Let go of thought, your individual thought. Thought is your prisoner. Breathe.

Machinery only, machinery only. Please turn around now. Machinery only, machinery only. Please turn around now. Please head back to your quarters. Machinery only, machinery only. Please turn around now. You must turn around. Please go back to your quarters. (glass rattling) You must turn around. Please go back to your quarters. (woman gasping) (footsteps tapping) (machines whirring) (door squeaking) (door thudding) (heartbeat whooshing) (alarm blaring) (footsteps tapping) (woman gasping) (alarms blaring) - [Man] Hey, Dad, can you hear me? Are you there? Dad, is she with you. Yes, it's me, can you hear me? Yes, we don't have connection either. No, no, it's all done. Yes, we got the leaflet. Yeah, she has to go, Dad. Hey, what am I supposed to do. It's too dangerous out there. We can't let her stay here. They know what's best for us. Yes, she agrees. I understand, Dad, but it's only gonna be for a couple of days. It'll be fine. (eerie music) (alarm buzzing) (computer whirring) (computer whirring) - [Computer] Room has been stabilized. Work, thank you. (footsteps shuffling) Breathe. (eerie rattling music) You see the work that you are doing, The sacrifices that you are making are so important. The machines are getting technically stronger and are almost ready to go outside. You and you alone are working for a better future for all of us. (heartbeat thudding) Soon... - Ready to go outside. - If you keep working. - Work. - And remain focused on the task... - You and you alone. - You will find a way. - The machines are getting technically stronger. - [Computer] You will find a way. (light clicks) - [Computer] The history since day zero. That's right, the day you joined us. It's been ever such a long time since you joined us. And well, look at you now. Look at this. This is what the world used to be like before you joined us. Look how terrifying it is. Can you see the people gathering against authority? Against those who know better. The world was in a desperate place. The world was a frightening place and the world still is a frightening place. But not, crucially, in here. You are safe here. Technology will set you free. The focus on the self will set you free. When you are concerned or worried, just think about how privileged you are to be here. Just look at the desolation out there. (guns firing) (people shouting faintly) (sirens wailing) (guns firing) (people shouting) (guns firing) (computer beeping) (quiet eerie music) - [Woman] Are you happy here? Is this enough? Can you see what you're doing? (gentle music) (bed creaking) (alarm blaring) - [Man] Why are you still here? You are late. It is waiting for its instructions. The machine is waiting for its instructions. It cannot get its instructions when you are not working. Why are you not at work? And you are late. You are late. You are late! (alarm blaring) (alarm buzzing) (eerie music) (alarm buzzing) (door whooshing) (alarm blaring) Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! This is an instruction. Get up! You do not have permission to lie on the floor. You do not have permission to sleep on the floor. (alarm blaring) You are listening to me, aren't you? Now let me remind you what a privilege it is to be here. Now we are getting less and less impressed with you. You are working less and less. This has to change. (alarm blaring faintly) Why are you not working like you used to? Do you not care? Don't you want to see your family again? Then work! Work! Work! (alarm blaring) It is time to show your gratitude. Time to show how much you care. Not for yourself, but all of us. You cannot sleep unless you believe. If you believe you will sleep. Join us in recognition of work, of the self, of technology, in the machine. Believe. (alarm blaring) We are worried about your commitment. We are worried about your commitment. We think it is only right that perhaps you work on something different. Something simpler. Something that will perhaps be more beneficial for you. Please go to your new office when you are ready. You can begin your new task. You are going to go, aren't you? You aren't going to continue to lose focus, are you? (door clicking) (keys clicking) (computer beeping) (computer alarm beeping) (wind whooshing) (door squeaking) (door thudding) (lights clicking) (footsteps tapping) (man sighing) (quiet eerie music) (footsteps tapping) (footsteps tapping) (hands clapping) (footsteps tapping) (hands clapping) (footsteps tapping) - 68? Can you hear me? 68? Give it more. Still fuzzy. (medication clicking) (wind roaring) 68! Can you hear me? Nod if you can hear me. Good. Good. 68, take this. (glass clattering) It's good for you. (woman gulping) Good. (glass shattering) Good, well done, 68. You've done so, so well. Now, 68, how's the isolation work been for you? Yes, you really need to try to talk to me, 68. Good, good, good. Now the thing is, 68. I'm not exactly sure how to word this, but, well, we've had a breakthrough. We are ready to send out our first fleet of engineers. And we thought, well, as you're one of the first ones in, you'd like to be one of the first ones out. Does that sound okay to you? As you know, 68, you're one of the best. We value your commitment, we need your skills out there. (wind roaring) We have had a report that suggests that your father might still be alive. We are awaiting confirmation. You would like to see your father again, wouldn't you? If you do this little task for us, you'll be able to. (dramatic suspenseful music) (door thudding) (door squeaking) Your task it simple. Take the machine to the predetermined location outside. (leaves rustling) - [Soldier] Follow me. Follow me. Yes, okay, read the sign please. You need to do exactly as I say. You only have so much oxygen with you. Now, follow me and keep close. (eerie music) (68 gasping) Don't look at them, follow me. Hello, have I lost you? Can you hear me? Hello? Look at me, concentrate, follow me. (dramatic music) (68 gasping) (birds chirping) (68 coughing) Wait there. (suspenseful music) (engine whooshing) (birds chirping) Go ahead, let's go. (68 panting) (birds chirping) Right, the machine room is through there. (footsteps shuffling) (dramatic tense music) (68 panting) There's the machine. Now, walk towards it. - [68] What? - [Soldier] I said, walk towards it. - [68] Yes. - [Soldier] Now, calm down, focus, breathe. We're losing you, focus, breathe. - [68] My savior. - [Soldier] Guys, we're losing her. Focus, calm down. - No, I can't, I can't... - Calm down. - [68] Okay, okay. (moans) (engine droning) - [Solider] Can you hear me? (68 gasping) Good, good. Calm down and breathe. Breathe in and out, slowly, deeply. (inhaling) That's it, that's it. (birds chirping) It's just the machine you've been working on. That's all it is, it's just a machine. Remember? You need to get up and walk towards it and help it find a way to move, okay? - Okay. (birds chirping) - [Soldier] It won't hurt you, just walk towards it. Go on. (68 gasping) Good. Now we need to find a way of making it move. I think it's very simple. Just keep looking, see if you can find something that you think might make it move. You see it blinks, doesn't it? Does that help you at all? Don't forget, we've trained you for this. I'm sure you'll figure it out in a moment. Something's going to happen I'm sure. Keep trying, go on, keep trying. You'll do it. (dramatic suspenseful music) Don't give up. Something's happening. Go on, turn around, that's it. Come on, you can do it. (68 gasping) It's moving. Okay, now remember, it knows the coordinates so you must keep it very much in view. (68 panting) (birds chirping) (footsteps crunching) (68 panting) - [68] Oh. - [Soldier] 68, you cannot afford to lose sight. (birds chirping) You're trying my patience now, 68. (birds chirping) (68 panting) That's it. Well done, now keep moving, faster, faster. Well done. (dramatic music) 68? Keep it in sight and do not deviate from the path. - [68] No, I can't. - [Soldier] No, 68, I know you can hear me. Where are you going? (68 gasping) Keep it in view, 68, where are you going? Pull yourself together! Come on, 68! You've lost the machine. (dramatic music) You've lost the machine. (clock ticking) (68 groaning) Ah, 68, you're awake. Good, well done. (68 panting) - [68] I can do it, I can. - [Soldier] The machine is on the far side of that line of trees. All you need to do is carry on walking, as much as you are. (68 panting) - [68] Yes. Oh, oh. - [Soldier] See the line of trees? It's the far side of those. It's waiting for you, expecting you. But you need to keep moving, 'cause your air supply will out very soon. (dramatic music) (68 panting) Keep going, 68, keep going. (birds chirping) (gras rustling) (68 moaning) (68 gasping) (birds chirping) Now, you need to keep moving forward. (dramatic music) Keep going straight. When you reach the flat surface, you need to turn right. And then keep moving. Your air supply is running dangerously low. Our signal is very weak. And it cuts off very soon. (birds chirping) (68 gasping) (footsteps shuffling) 68, 68, your air is about to run out! You need to run, 68, before your air runs out! (68 moaning) Keep running, 68! It's very, very important that you meet your location. (footsteps tapping) keep moving, your air is about to run out. Do not stop under any circumstances. Keep going, keep moving, run! (68 moaning) - Yes. (key pad beeping) (eerie music) This it? (gate whirring) (68 moaning) Come on, come on. My air's going, come on, come on! (panting) (footsteps tapping) (eerie ominous music) (68 gasping) (68 groaning) (clock ticking) (footsteps shuffling) (68 gasping) (floorboards creaking) (footsteps tapping) (water splashing) (footsteps tapping) (wind whooshing) (metal rattling) - You're late. Would you like a drink or some food? No? (birds chirping) Take off this irritation! (68 screaming) Should we go through? It's just through here. If you'd just like to follow me through here. I won't be long. I've just got to go and get changed. I'm sorry about the mess. You can say hello to The Client if you'd like. It's the one you'll be replacing. Go ahead, you can just sit over there, no problem. That's it. I won't be long. (clock ticking) (footsteps tapping) Should we get on with it then? Yeah? Okay. Let me show you this. Have you ever seen one of these before? What about this? Have you ever seen one of these before? No? Okay. I've got a couple more in here, somewhere. Somewhere in there. Ah. Yeah, okay, so. This is a, well, we like to call it a contract termination device, okay. So, would you like me to show you how it works? Yeah, okay. So, I'm gonna walk up to him, all right. Okay, and then you're gonna, (gun clicks) I'll have already put the bullet in for you. That will be locked in. And then you're gonna put the gun against his forehead and then this here, pull it towards you and then that will be it. All right, just pull the trigger and that will get rid of it. Nothing more than wires and mesh, all the things you've been working on. There's nothing else. All right? Just take that, actually no, just hold on, why don't you take that off. Yeah, it's a bit of a mess, isn't it? All right. Okay, just, walk along there for me. (footsteps tapping) Now just very carefully, if you just, just place that right there. All right, and then, if you just pull the trigger, that's it. That's it. All right. Go on. It's just a machine. Go on. (gun firing) (high pitched alarm wailing) All right. I'll take that. All right, let's go. Sit down over here. And I'll explain everything. (clock ticking) What you've just experienced, what you have been experiencing. (dramatic ominous music) The world had changed. Something had happened. Something, though it had no name, had arrived, fear. Fear overtook rationale. The new age of reliance had begun. Those who wanted power know that to achieve it, they must have complete control and get rid of any future dissent. To understand this, they placed selected future generations into an experiment and to cause a new belief system, a dogma was given to you. You see? And how do they get this power? They get this power by focusing on trigger points to know when and why they happen. Those moments, in the human condition, when the heart doesn't just speak, it sings. It trembles. It begs! (door thudding) (dramatic music) (canister popping) Those in the age of reliance, who ignored orders, who rejected comfort and chose to think for themselves, were stamped out, crushed. (ominous music) You've had these trigger points, and the cause, the cause that you had that was imposed on you has now been born in you. You see, with all this, you have a real cause now. And so there's no way that they would let you go now. So if you would please. (gun clicking) Move, please. Go on. Go on! You see, I suppose I've always thought that, perhaps, if a blind faith in a ideology was a prison, then there was always going to be doubt that set you free. Don't you see, the thing is, for this short period, you have been free. Thank you for all your help. Thank you for all that you've done for us, thank you. (glass crashing) (dramatic music) (glass crashing) (man groaning) - Come on. (birds chirping) And so, I have written this for you. She was now free. But free to do what? Her heart spoke, but perhaps for her mind it was too late. How would she navigate the world? How could she navigate the world. A world where she was commanded to rely only on information and not on knowledge. No longer capable of reason or logic, her rights lost, our rights, our gains. For what? To feel secure? To give meaning? A belief in a made up cause, a dogma, an ideology constructed only to destroy her individualism. What too of the sacrifices she made for others? The progress of others? This, thankfully, has not happened, yet. And so, to the future. A future I fear for you. A future where others are deciding our fate for us. As technology advances, what will become of our nature and of nature itself? We are possibly on the cusp of a new industrial revolution, the rise of artificial intelligence, of machines, of perhaps, as some would have it, the eradication of death itself. Perhaps we should ask simply, do we want this? So as not to let them reach conclusions that are best for us, but instead, we should perhaps have the courage to find those that are right for us. I have one wish for you. Please do not seek refuge in the echo chamber. Be brave, question, think. Reach your own conclusions. I love you. I love you. (somber music) (birds chirping) (engine droning)
