[instrumental music] [instrumental music] [intense music] [helicopter whirring] [instrumental music] [all screaming] I got what you need. Come on. Down here. - I said come on. - Okay, okay, okay. Relax, okay? I got it. What is that? Is that coke? Yeah. It's that dust, okay? That spooky shit. It's the good shit. - What does that mean? I.. - Fuck's sake. I mean, like, what is it exactly? What do you want it to be? - I want it to be Molly. - Alright. It's Molly. But, I mean, are you just saying that, 'cause.. No. I was just saying the other things. This is real. Molly for the dolly, the whole ping ting. Oh, bruh. - Okay, so 80 bucks, right? - Yeah. - Okay, cool. Thank you. - Okay, give it up. Now. I seen all of it. Give it up. The cash, brother, quick. I said, hand it over. I'm sorry. Are you arresting us? Oh, my God. Please don't kill me. Look, I have... I have a 3.8 grade point average, okay? - His mom has a guide dog. - I'm not gonna kill you. I'm gonna give you your money back. - Stream it for me, Africa. - Yes, sir. What is it, are we gonna have to suck each other's dicks or something? No, not if you make a small donation to the Star of Six Community Farm and Charity Mission. Yes, I would love to do that. Is ten bucks good? - Each, so 20. - Great. - Thanks. - Okay. May you live to see the accidental dominance of the white race overthrown. Cool. It is not yet the day, but the day shall come. - Tell your people. - Okay. On the day of Black Jihad, Sultan will look on you with mercy. Well, thank you. Come on. Okay, cool. I'll see you guys. Fuck! The cops will bust you even if you're just dealin' sugar, bruh. Just trying to take back a smidge of what the crackers stole, Sultan. Ad hoc reparations, no! You ever seen me bop a cracker at a stoplight jack his Buick and shout "That's my forty acres and a mule?" No, but I'd like to. I wouldn't want to. Uh-huh? How old you are? Sounding so mature. You come to my shop, I give you lollipop. Can you prepare for The Day if you're in jail, brother? - No, sir. - I'm lookin' out for you. Thank you, sir. So, when we get back, you may valet the bus. Black Santa prevail. [intense music] In the name of Allah, Melchizedek Jesus, Black Santa Muhammad and General Toussaint the waters rise, brothers and sisters the drains back up the basements of South Beach brim with reeking flotsam. But the city turns away, ignores the signs. Prepare ye for the day that approaches is the day of the great inversion. On that day, the cranes of the gentrificators shall fall and we shall overthrow the injustice of the white European. Till then, Allah enjoins us to grow strong and to prepare. Are you ready to rule? - We are ready to rule. - We are ready to rule. The Almighty commands us to bring our knowledge to the streets. ♪ European you will pay ♪ European you will pay ♪ This will be your judgement day ♪♪ Projecting a vision of the future. Peace, brothers. To set a mighty example. To rescue the fallen teaching discipline of body and mind. You brothers wanna work on God's farm? The wisdom of the Star of Six. Revolution. But without the gun weapon. You know what the gun is? It's what the white man gave us to destroy each other doin' his job for him. We trust only the weapons of tradition the sword, the sling and the crossbow. Today, the economic hit man profits off the gentrification of our neighborhoods. But tomorrow, he will drown all bubble-face brown in his vile extortionate coffee. In the name of Allah, Melchizedek, Jesus, Black Santa Muhammad and General Toussaint. - Bishops. - Bishops. - Sir, bus is all clean. - All of it? Except where the baked-in chicken shit and whatnot is part of the floor. Breakfast surprise! - Oh, donuts? - Mnm-mnm. Donuts are twice a year, baby girl, on your birthday and the day that your daddy founded this mission. Mm-hmm. The day God talked to me through a duck. Usually, it was Satan talking through the duck. But one day, satan wasn't looking and the duck said, "Quickly. This is God talking. You need to build me a farm." And that's why we're here. ♪ Ta-da-da-ta ♪♪ Is this surprise from a dumpster? No, it's not from a dumpster. I picked it up from Wendy's yesterday. When they throw everything in the dumpster. Before they threw it in the dumpster. - Just before? - Look, the dates are good. And plus, we are taking from the rich to give to the poor. What don't you like about that? Nothing. Is the smart thing to say right now. [instrumental music] SWAT Team B, Team C is in position. Over. SWAT A? Psst, psst, Kendra, prepare to be amazed. Your target's approaching. Yeah. Target's approaching. [all cheering] Brother Malik the bomb in the drinks cart will do something very beautiful. The bomb will only take out the men, right? - What? - The men are the soldiers. The women are not the soldiers. Only the men. Yes, yes, of course, just the men. You... you see the... the wheel guards? - Uh-huh. - They shape the blast. Only the men die in the blast. A hundred percent? - No lady jihad? - Hundred percent. That's a conscience made of tits. Dial the number, brother. SWAT o'clock. Stand by, ladies. You missed the button. Oh, SWAT, stand by. Stand by, SWAT A. SWAT B stand by. - What's that? - It's a three. You know, like, one, two, three. Fucker's texting the jury, "I am guilty." Now five. Five? No, no, not five. Give me another. - Look, it's five. - I'm scared of fives. Five is evil, brother. The halfway digit. The saluting snake. No. Did we know he was a pentaphobe? I'm scared of fives. No fives. - Or is he just backin' out? - No way. I groomed this psycho. No, no, jihad has no off switch, Rick. It's like that feeling in a dream when you've killed a child. No. It's the unflushable number. Oh, okay, just bring up the whole number. That number is a plague of fuckin' fives. If the guy is afraid of fives then that number's a real soup sandwich. The next number is a two, so it's like a 52. That's a five, brother. It's still a five. We are dialing our own bomb here, Andy. Shall we just send the fuckin' target home? Okay, now four. You do it. This is a four. It's not even a five. Please. My fingers won't work anymore. It's just killing a few fucking kids. Jesus Christ! I dial one four, you dial one four, okay? Dial the last number, brother. Dial it. Come on. - Shazam! - Go, go, go! Go. I think God stopped it, brother. Police! Hands up, now! Police! Let me see your hands! - Get down! - On the ground! Yes! Great job, guys. Ristretto. One sugar cube. Yeah. Great job, guys. Shitty job, guys. Most of that bomb was dialed by us. What if some libtard on my jury thinks that's a little unfair to Ali Bin Weasel? Hey! Assholes, what the fuck was that fives bullshit? - This is your fault. - You saw the paperwork, Rick. Don't hide behind a piece of paper, Andy unless you're a fuckin' tampon wrapper. Right. You mean tampon? Look, I'm dropping it, alright? I'm a genius attorney, but you need to retire on a better case unless you wanna spend your twilight years on a Segway as a mall cop. For the record, this is an FBI operation in which the police played no decision-making role. Says the man with a very small badge. No, police badge is 14 percent larger than an FBI badge. And it's also heavier by weight. Brother Pure, that's what I'm gonna call you. 'Cause you're pure like the piss of a dove, man. Thank you, sir. Professor X, Farmer Africa, are not pure. - X like Malcolm X? - After the X-Wing. "Star Wars." This brother could fly if he put his mind to it. Ninety-seven percent of our brains aren't used, bruh. One hundred percent in your case. Come the day, I shall buckle those cranes with one flick of my brain, brothers. And the day is coming. Time to put nail bombs in their Whole Foods. - No, brother. - No, sure, just one. No, brother, you may not do that. No, but we may. Why may we not? We shall not start a race war we will definitely lose. The Farmer Army is not yet to scale. When General Toussaint was attacked after church did he strike the white man who hit him? Did he set him on fire? He waited ten years for the revolution then he bopped him, right? - No. - Yes, brother. I mean, that no. [indistinct chatter] Damn! What did I tell you was gonna happen if you didn't pay? - Notice of eviction. - Notice of eviction. - All out. You ain't paid. - You can't just walk in.. Yeah, yeah, it's to the end of the month that we ain't paid, Ruben. Right, but that's bullshit, okay? Look, I'm a very successful businessman, alright? I got watches showin' three different times. Ruben, Ruben, brother. How big is the biggest omelet you ever ate? No, not eggs. What about eggs that taste like eggs before science fiction? You're not payin' me in eggs again, Venus. Okay, how about some fried potatoes? I bought 'em by the flea market. You could use 'em at your restaurant. Real good ones, brother. Man said he could hardly bear to sell them. - They're wooden. - They're what? They're wooden? You didn't check the potatoes, Mo? What? But the ones he showed me were real. You should have checked 'em, alright? Since when did we have to start checking if potatoes was wood.. - Yeah, well, I checked them. - I can get you that machine. The X-ray machine. No idea what you're talkin' about. I know what you're doin', bruh. You're makin' a ray gun, some dirty cool shit. You said when you was drunk. Look, look, you want a ray gun? I got what you need. I'll take good merchandise or you're out. But, uh, look, brother. - It's bent. - Just at one end. On purpose. Moses, you know how a real ray gun works? That's the gun part. Now all you need is the rays, brother. Okay, look, I have a client who needs radioactive material that gives off rays, like fuel rods or something from an X-ray machine. This is basically just a fuckhead's paperweight. I'll unbend it. [dramatic music] - Nice building, Andy. - Thanks, Rick. Was the bureau high when they commissioned this? 'Cause it actually looks like a personality disorder. Oh, he's on a roll. You know, Bin Laden got you this. It's a shit roll. You guys should put a big picture of him up the front of the building like the Colonel Sanders logo. Shit just rolls out of his mouth. So, as to your mall cop jibe, Rick... You're gonna pitch me the next 9/11. You know, the Mexican Hezbollah is planning an attack on Orlando. Flooding the streets with alligators? - Still a threat, Rick. - It's a literal croc of shit. There's a guy who wants to attack a strip club from a balloon with flaming urine. That was an undercover cop. He had a breakdown and he blew up his own bladder. Right. What about this guy Moses Shabazz? Who? He preaches overthrow of the government on Facebook Live. He does? Cheryl has that. That's my wife. She's quite cool. - He talks about black jihad. - Right. Huh? Classic lone wolf. Uh, there's four of them, actually. Pack of lone wolves. Had to happen. - It's a uniformed militia. - Oh. Wait. Andy, he's black? - Yeah. - Fuckin' black? - Seriously? - Hold on. All these, they're totally fuckin' black. I mean, wake up, people. Come on. We're down with brown, but black is whack. - Black is whack? - Don't twist my words. I'm not racist. Black targets are no longer cool. It's not my fault. The cops have fucked the legal optics. You mean, their skin's black, but they're basically brown, right? Think ISIL Panthers. - Uh, brown blacks. - Brown blacks. Sir, if they break the law, it doesn't matter if their skin's made of bark and they worship a pig in a wing suit. Right. So I can get the local informant... Uh, my informant, Reza, he could set up a meeting between this Shabazz and, um, a rich ISIL sheikh played by the beach informant, Nur Ad-din. He's annoying, but he's a good closer. Uh, Nur Ad-din hates other informants. Flies solo. I think he would hate it more if we sent him back to Syria even though the real estate deals are supposed to be amazing right now. Right, so let's offer this Moses Shabazz some funds get him some military equipment from, uh, some catalogue. He has no license. Get him some automatic weapons. Could you walk him across the line? Of course, yeah. Brown blacks track, yes. - Right. - She means no. I mean, theoretically she could, but Reza works for us because we're shielding him from sex charges with minors and he's still at it. We shouldn't expose a female agent to that especially a very small one. That's sexist, and heightist and probably offensive to pedophiles, which is really something. I can... I can handle Reza, yeah. Good. Uh, please don't fuck it up. Won't fuck it up. Won't let you down. Won't let any of you down. Except for Stevie, 'cause he wants me to fuck it up. So I will let him down happily. [dog barking at a distance] I think we ruined with this eviction thing, Vee. Like flat tire, empty icebox ruined. Can't be a farmer without a farm. I can't even move the wheel. A farm can be anywhere, Mo. It's an attitude of mind. They make me drowsy. And they stop you from thinking that animals can talk to you or that you have five arms. Damn! Was it the heat of my hands or was it a miracle? Did you... did you blow? No. I made an effort. I mean, will God bring down the cranes if you ain't trying first? Will the gentrificators dump their condos on our heads? [blows] [both blowing] - I don't think so. - I don't think so. Your bikini comes off in my mouth. Not my style. I want to feel your hot, moaning breath on my ball sack. Doesn't sound like me either. You said them both today, Reza. How old was she? - Thirty-five? Thirty-six? - Fifteen. - A minor. - She was Canadian. They don't even have minors in Canada. I've got 800 pages of this stuff. I'm all that stands between you and 20 years in a penitentiary that uses your screams to power the lights. [speaking in foreign language] [intense music] Let up, Farmer X. Go! And go. Up! Down! Up! Down! Go! Down! Arms up! Duck walk. Ducks are strong. Strong ducks win. Ducks are mighty ducks. - Right, Brother Pure? - Sir. - Hello. - Hey, Reza. Salaam Alaikum, sister. How are you? Hello. Buk-buk-buk. - Brother Shopkeeper. - The man's up to somethin'. Yes, to help in your enterprise. And what enterprise would that be, brother? All of it, actually. Growing the fresh vegetables, playing chess keeping fit, the great inversion bringing down the cranes bringing down the government. - What sort of help? - Cash. Really quite a lot of cash. ♪ Bismillah al rahman al rahim ♪♪ Stop makin' that noise. So tell me, Reza, what cash you talkin' about? - My uncle... - Take your shirt off. - What cash, brother? - My uncle... Star jump. My uncle from the Middle East he very much admires your work. My work? From the Middle East? Burpee. They travel widely. They're very rich. We have no interest in cash. Tell me how it works. Duck pose. My uncle comes to the Holiday Inn. We don't need to get hustled by your imaginary uncle, Reza. He is not imaginary. He is real. He is a mujahideen. He has a bad limp, from a bullet to the foot. Yes. - He has a built-up shoe. - What's his name? Uncle Scam? Sultana and me, we got plenty of good finance options, bruh. - Wells Fargo. Bank of America. - The United Dollars Bank. - The big money buildin'. - We got options. - The other one next to it. - Thank you, Reza. Okay. Then I'm happy to hear you don't need me. I am weak, but I am strong. [intense music] Mr. and Mrs. Al Shabazz. - Mr. Foltz. - Hi. How you doin'? A gift from the farm. Fresh chicken eggs, eggplant and black Yaupon tea. Filter out the bark with your teeth. It's strained, but the debris, it's just fiber, so it's good. - An example of our produce. - Just some. Please, be seated. So the, uh, charitable loan, yes? Ten thousand dollars for the Star of Six Community Farm. It's the non-profit application? Correct, sir. We make a loss. Financial loss, but spiritual gain. - But, I mean, we can change. - Oh, sure. Put that as a profit if you like, if that's better. Uh, right, there might also be a problem with your 501[c][3] tax relief application. We have that, just not in writing. So the IRS might fail your organization if it's seen to be political? Yeah, that's why it's not in writing 'cause the writing is wrong. Uh, so you're not political? Well, everything's political, brother. - I mean, we're not political. - No more than a bank. Look, my farmers used to sell drugs, bruh. Now they grow kale and marshal ducks for the Almighty. That is great. You know Marcus Garvey said there would be three more after him? Elijah, Muhammad, Malcolm X and the third has yet to be revealed. Oh, okay. My mission is to change the lives of poor people using all my abilities including the untapped invisible. All the electrons in space. The mighty beast of my bloodline. You should know that I descend from a long line of powerful bears. It's not just a farm. I mean, it's a school. I mean, you lend to the nail bar and they jerk off Koreans out back. That's just what folks say. It may be racist, so.. Okay, uh, look, maybe if you could provide security we could just do a, a straight loan. Do you have security or.. What security do you have apart from the American government which is bust? Well, the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation backs up all the accounts at this bank up to $250,000. So in terms of cash for your farm it just doesn't seem like this is gonna work out. I'm... I'm sorry. [sighs] [intense music] - Hello! - Black Santa prevail. - Yes, Black Santa. - What is this? Your uncle wants us on some pyramid selling deal for cleaning products? Somethin' like that? Sultan, I assure you my uncle is good straight cash. Take this, brother. Don't be afraid to use it. Activating recording at 11:06. I have some expense receipts for you. It's mostly the usual. Rent, food, gas. This fucking orthopedic clog. Reza, take that thing. Put it right there, in the center. Tell him I will see him now. Twenty-two stress consultations and a massage and a Bobby Brown boxset for more stress because I had to kill a dog. The prophet will see you now. [speaking in foreign language] [groans] You bring this fish to me and go. He is my fish, you brute. The money they pay you should be coming to me. So my hands are crushing your balls even when I let go. [groaning] Let's go. Salaam Alaikum, prophet. - Make yourself comfortable. - Thank you. Have a seat on the table. It is our custom. - So.. - So.. Your work is very much admired by the chief sheikh of IS. The tax office? Unfortunately they do not admire my work. IS, prophet. Islamic State? Al-Qaeda, same thing. Al-Qaeda. Yes. I'm sorry for the loss of your Sheikh Osama. Though you know he never really existed. He was a figment of European paranoia which is why he still lives. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] My uncle says that his sheikh offers large sums of money to help oppressed people build armies. You have an army, prophet? - Every nation has an army. - Yes. Mm-hmm. How large is your army? Oh, large. How many could you have here tomorrow? - Four. - An army of four? Five, actually. My daughter is due for promotion. The rest would come on a first some, then more basis. Mr. Moses, are you serious? - Am... am I serious? - Yes. Give him a list of the hardware, Shopkeeper. "Ten rolls of fencing. Work boots. Overalls." - "A chicken coop?" - And a watch for my wife. And a horse. They don't do horses but a general should have a horse. Perhaps your army needs weapons too? Guns. - Guns. - No. Allah says until the day shall the bullet weapon be silent. Nothing to defend your farm? We have a crossbow. And if necessary, we'll call on the dinosaurs. The CIA has some left over from when the Europeans wiped them out. We believe that at the sound of a trumpet they will come to our aid. [foghorn blares] - Very good, brother, yes. - Is a ray gun a bullet weapon? - What? - A ray gun. You want a ray gun? X-rays? Radioactives? I can find isotopes. Ruben's gun don't use no bullets, Sultan. No, but we only permit projectiles of the visible realm. Of course. Very good, brother. I shall put this to the sheikh. So that he may fund our mission? Inshallah, inshallah. May Black Santa prevail. Yes, and Black Caesar and Black Snow White and Black T-Rex. He's gotta be good for what like...$500, right? Lord Moses, these are very serious people. They pay, like.. ...$50,000. - Fifty thousand? - Yes. But for proper army weapons. Not these things so incredibly offbeat. I need guns. Assault weapons. Destroy the government. - What did you say? - Assault weapons. Uh, destroy the government. Yes, please. Very good, brother. Nura. You know all the black brothers in jail? That is our army, waitin' for us to break 'em out. Like General Toussaint. Like Spartacus. Black Santa crashin' his sleigh into the White House. But you said guns are not allowed. Well, I just prayed to God and He told me they are. I shut my eyes and he wrote "Guns okay" on my eyelids. Guns okay. It's cash, right, from the sheikh? Not checks written on camels? American dollars, brother. And 50 Kalashnikov assault rifles for your army banana clip, folding stock. Um, Nura. How about money now, guns next year? So that we can build a rack. A good sturdy rack. Also so we have time to practice so that when we get the guns, we're good with them. You can practice with my guns, of course. Use living Americans as targets, yes. Who cares if you shoot a Kaffir, a bull's-eye through the brain or just rip half its face off? Cheeks flap, eyes burst, yes? Cheek, cheeks flap. Eyes burst. Al-Qaeda magazine. [intense music] God's miracles take many forms brothers and sisters. We do not question them. We accept God's plan for us and we are grateful. In the name of Allah, Melchizedek, Jesus, Black Santa Muhammad and General Toussaint. What? Come on, tell me this ain't good. - This ain't good. - You like your watch? Your boots, brothers? Your... your new uniforms? - And this? - You don't have to read it. 50K, Vee. We made. Reza's uncle gives you 50K, he owns your ass. I own his ass, babe. I hustled him. He's a wonky wheel. He's gonna give us guns too. - But I told him... - Guns? Yeah, but you don't have to worry, bruh. We're just gonna take 'em and bury 'em under six feet of concrete. Come on. We're goin' to my sister's. Vee. Wait. Vee! We can even fill our guns with concrete paint 'em white and use 'em for fence posts. We hustlin' this guy. You trying to save these boys from guns. You just gonna throw it all away for a hat and a horse? You make a bomb out of bamboo canes. - You see what you're doing? - He don't mean that. Do you mean that? Sugar, coconut, bleach and acetone. This ain't us, Mo. This ain't the farm. 50K, Vee. I'm savin' the farm. If you believe that, then there ain't nothin' to save. Come on, baby girl. Sir, we don't believe in guns, though, do we? Of course not, but I just talked to God and He told me unless you fire it, a gun is just a stick. Well, I suggest you ask Him again. Okay. Thank you. He said the same thing. - We done, Mo. - Vee. Fifty percent of her is my sister. She's your half-sister. Well, yeah. Black Santa be with you, Sultan. You're bein' played, Mo. But, Vee, Vee, what if I'm playin' them whoever it is that's playin' me? A violin don't play a bow. Vee! Vee! Rosa, baby, open the door. Open the door, baby. - Mom? - No. Open the door! Open the door! Open the.. Vee, no! Vee! Vee! [instrumental music] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] You think this shit gonna work out? Excuse my language. You have a long, wise face, sister horse. Is Vee comin' back? Can you answer me? No. Have I just blown everything we stand for? [thunder rumbling] Holy shit! Did I just do that? Did I? [indistinct radio chatter] Okay, guys, food's up. I got you sunflower seeds, dried cranberry chia seed bars, crispy kale. And donuts and coffee. Come on. Hey, all 50 pins drilled out on those guns, right? Arrest plan, box three. There's a video of each drilling on the red flash drive. In the right order? Serial number equals date equals yes, in the right order. So 50 AKs sounds about right, yeah? I kind of wish this asshole was gonna blow up Disney World. - It's solid. - Heads up. Your pet kiddy kisser's on level two. He's come to bitch about Nur Ad-din. Uh, what sub-tab is that in your arrest plan here? He's timeline peripheral. Can you just pay his expenses, get rid of him, please? Happy to be just peripherals guy. Don't sell yourself short, Stevie. I mean, didn't you see your special arrest plan? That's not funny because I'm not even laughing, so.. Fuck me, guys. How old are you? - Thank you, sir. - Are you five? Good one, sir. Thanks. Setting up a perimeter, we need four... - Guns in place. Check. - Okay. It's the good guys bit. It's good being the good guys. Tell SWAT to stand by. And, lo, Moses shall take the guns and, lo, Kendra shall bust his ass. Copy that. SWAT A is standing by. Why has he stopped there? What is he doing? Oh, wow! - Actual factual wow. - What? Can you chuck the CCTV up on the smart board for me? He's here? Oh, come on! Two minutes ago. One minute. Real time. Shit a pineapple. Shit a live yodeling manatee. What is your full name, sir? Moses Al Shabazz. - That was me. - I'm sorry? Me and my horse. You know, we did that. Sir, do you have an appointment? Could you make me one? - Okay, what do we do now? - I don't know, Andy. Maybe we should ask the special agent in charge of this building. Okay, uh, I'll go talk to Moses, find out what he wants. So he looks like our friend? Bang goes my rocket docket. Sure, not good. Um, We tell him everybody's busy. He leaves right now. And maybe you just blanked a walk-in confession? Okay, poker face, totally neutral. I just get him to walk back out there into our next chapter. Trust me, sir. I know how this plays. Uh, if I may, sir, I think this plays like a pennywhistle jammed up an orangutan's butt. What use is that comment to anyone? You're right, sir. Sorry. - Ow! - Meeting room seven. If he says the wrong thing, I leave it off the 302. So you're here about our community outreach program? Yes, ma'am. I believe you offer rewards for justice? As in.. If I had certain information regarding individuals selling firearms would you be interested? Uh, you mention a reward? If you can pay us $50,000 I can show you a man trading AK-47s. Fuck it! Fuck me. Uh, well, okay, look, uh there are rewards available, yes. It's a process. It starts with us needing your full criminal and employment record, your immigration status any family members' immigration status. - Good block. Okay, good block. - Smart rat. Your tax returns for the last 15 years you have those in good order, yes? Not on me right now, but, uh, what about for cash today? Could you pay someone to inform upon themselves? You wanna inform on yourself? Yes. Say if I was thinking of doing something and then I stopped before and came to you and informed you about the thing I was thinking of doing and maybe, uh, you could pay me to... Have you done something that you should inform us about? No, ma'am. That's lying to a federal agent. Five years right there. Andy, just get him back out there to blow up a skyscraper or I'll drop the case. Uh, well, Mr. Bey Al Shabazz, we appreciate your contact. Thank you so much. I was gonna take the guns but just turn them into fence posts. Fence posts? Fill it with concrete and paint it white. We don't believe in guns, but the guy was gonna pay me. My farm is broke. Well.. ...community support is very important to us. Okay. Different communities, same needs. Okay, so can you help? Not at this time, no. Oh. But, um, thank you for the information. Communities. Communities. - I let him go. - Oh, great call. We've got harpoons in him. We just sit back calmly and watch the barrels. No, I mean, I let him go. He's got the threat signature of a hot dog. Kendra, he just admitted he wanted guns. For fence posts. Yeah, I mean, like you said leave that non-material detail off the 302. He wanted guns. Sir, I don't love saying this but I made a mistake. - I think he's delusional. - Okay, well, yeah. Schizophrenia plays. Right, Rick? On the fourth circuit, but you have to fly them to Virginia and then rearrest them when they land. Sure, whatever, perfect. He did just report us as the threat. Nails of Christ, people. Just because Sheikh Alaikum reports that Abu Woowack is a terrorist doesn't mean that Sheikh Alaikum's not a terrorist too, right? I mean, he was false flaggin' us. Twice. He double false flagged us. So regular flagging. He took pictures of the building. - I think those were selfies. - Yeah. Selfie jihad is bombing reconnaissance. Okay, look, we throw him a 100K he will definitely do something for that. Andy, you're happy with that, what you just said? It's a fool proof plan, Rick. We give him an actual fake bomb and the guy tries to use it we have the next Bin Laden, even if he's Archie Bunker. I smell doubt. No, look, I am just a guy standing here talking to another guy trying to send a third guy to jail. I'm one leg down on the beach case already. Sir, I think you might have to get fitted for doggy wheels. I'm paying off Nur Ad-din tomorrow. I'm closing the case. Ah.. She's actually saving your ass, Andy. My ass is gonna be dragged to DC and beaten so badly you can drink it through a straw. Well, at least it's not your fault, sir. It's just my fault. Did it to myself, so.. Watch out for the nice ones, Kendra. They get under your skin and then, next thing you know the Statue of Liberty's wearing a burkha and we've beheaded Bruce Springsteen. [instrumental music] [intense music] I think we should have gotten Ruben his ray gun. - Do I have to go back home now? - No. We'll all live on the bus, yeah? Damn. You... you saw the cranes, right? I did that. It was a sign from God. This wasn't supposed to happen. If you did that, then I can put worms in a cracker's sandwich. You may not put worms in a cracker's sandwich, bruh. Not yet. It's not yet the day. ♪ Bastards always late ♪ Dumb morons taking too long to pay my expenses ♪♪ We should have signed off this perp with a drone strike. Bad feeling, huh? When you over crank your case into a first-class snafu. ♪ FBI Shut up. ♪ Let's go you pieces of shit ♪ Just embrace the failure, Kendra. Believe me, it helps raise your natural game. Oh, your natural game's at the FDA monitoring meat gas infractions. - Hey, Haji Connick Jr. - That's racist. You gotta own this snafu in writing. These guarantee your anonymity as an informant. They mean nothing. Every day I save you idiots from 9/11. How's that? The FBI is how America fucks itself. [speaking in foreign language] [cell phone ringing] What happened yesterday, brother? I'm very upset. Um, my horse got stuck. The tire.. The... the shoe. It's okay. I forgive you. - Do you want the guns now? - No. No. Um, what I need is.. I need some radioactives. You know, for ray guns? Can you say that again, please, brother? I need radioactive stuff. - Nuclear materials? - Yeah. Like you said at the hotel. - Can you do that? - One second, brother, okay? Shabazz, you fuckhead. I'm just going through my, uh, nuclear contacts list okay, brother? Okay. Okay, so we have to get him a fake nuke. Just.. This is the same as the guns. The fake nuke stops him getting a real one from somebody else. No, I've been outside having a cigarette for the past five minutes. Stevie, come on. Get Shabazz some lead canisters. He accepts. That proves intent. Couple of days later we show up to fill up the canisters with nukes, except we arrest him. Alright, well, that's way off protocol. It doesn't matter. Do it! Okay, brother, I fix this for you. Great. I love you, my brother. I love you too, yeah. Andy's gonna shit his mind straight through the floor. No, Andy's gonna be fine. I just need to be there to tell him. The second he gets back from DC. Catch his brains in a bucket give them a squelch and jam them back in. Alright. If this works, then it was largely my idea. Yeah, yeah, and if it doesn't, you're outside the blast zone watching my skin fall off. Conviction bonus. We are back in business. Who are these for? It's for some guys who need nukes. It's a normal nuke handover. [intense music] [sighs] I'm gonna check my clients are ready, alright? Okay. [sighs] [intense music] [exhales] [exhales] [bird squawking] [music continues] If I had told you about it, you wouldn't have come, okay? So just be quiet and keep cool, you'll be okay. Okay. We're just cuttin' a deal. Polite faces, y'all. And if it gets too honky Hitler in there just zone out, think mangoes. Mangoes. [sighs] Name's Lemmy. - Moses. - Mangoes. Nice place you got here, Lemmy. We like it. - It's not too urban. - Mangoes. Okay, look, Lemmy's a racist, okay? But he's one of the good ones. He should tread carefully. We intend to rule this country. Our plan's not unlike that. Mangoes, mangoes, mangoes. Why does your boy keep saying mangoes? Sultan, why do we keep talkin' to these inbred knuckle-draggers whose race was created by an alien fucking a pig? [laughs] Please, uh, stand outside, Farmer Africa. What my brother here was merely suggesting in his own way is that we proceed to the agenda of our meeting? Right. What materials do you got? Uranium. Uranium? To put hair on your chest and make it fall off. Ooh. Where did you get uranium? IS. IS? Islamic State. Not the tax office. Easy mistake to make. You have nukes from the Islamic State? Yes. H... how much do you want for it? - A hundred thousand dollars. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, Moses. - That's way too much... - I'll do a 100K. - You will? - Yeah. I got a backer in Maine. He can sell his yacht. So are we gonna handshake on a 100K? I think we are. Uh-huh? I'm puttin' up your rent. I'm puttin' up his rent. I don't give a shit. [intense music] For the black jihad, brothers. - Black jihad. - Black jihad. - Is it in here? - No, no, no, no, not yet. I'll come back with the uranium next week. Then we will fill them. American babies with five legs and faces growing inside their assholes. Yes. - September 11th. - September 12th. Of course. [engine revving] Look, I'll take a better idea if you got one. A better idea than sellin' nukes to Nazis? How about not sellin' nukes to Nazis? Let me out the bus, please, Sultan. - They're empty, bruh. - They don't look empty. They look the same either way when the lid's on. So that looks full? When they're actually full the lid's screwed down so you can't take it off. So we should just fill it with piss and beans. No, bruh. Who respects a nation that stockpiles piss and beans? Mashallah, brother. You know what you just said? No. - Well, you got anything, man? - About half a drip. If I push any harder, I'm gonna breach the hold. [cell phone ringing] Vee? Vee? - Daddy? - Baby girl. Are you coming to my birthday party? Sure I am. I'm gonna get you a whole box of donuts. Will it just be the holes again? No, it'll be the rings this time. - Really? - Who you talkin' to, baby girl? Daddy. You can't fix this by manipulating the child, Moses. - She called me, Vee. - Did Daddy call you? - Well, all the same. - You just called me "Daddy". - I feel good about that. - Well, don't. We're gettin' the farm back, Vee. Did you... did you take the guns? Farmer Africa, did we take the guns? Unfortunately no, sir. I... I'll tell you all about it over donuts, Vee. It'll be the icing on the donut unless the donut's already got icing. Then it'll be the icing on the icing. I'm not supposed to be talkin' to you right now. Vee, this is a very good reverse potato situation. Well, this is a reverse hello situation. Goodbye. Hello? Vee? - Is Daddy coming? - I don't know, baby girl. You're better off askin' his horse. [engine starting] And a handful of beans. No wonder most places ain't got nukes. It's hard to make a nuke. These are still piss and beans, though, right? Yes. [intense music] [engine revving] [intense music] Andy. Andy. It's unorthodox, yes, but.. Andy. Hiya. Yep? Okay. Open the gate. Open the gate. Thank you. Already Miami beach is eying 500 million dollars in.. Oh, God. Hey. Jesus wept. - Welcome back. - Oh, thank you. Uh, just a parking lot catch-up. Lots to fill you in on. Uh, good stuff, great stuff. Um, shall I get you a straw? Uh, what stuff? Uh, well, this is, like, 20 good things that are all good. I just need to tell you them in the right order. Okay, hit me. I can double-hand it. Okay. Um, so, the.. - I don't know if it's.. - It's... The long and short of this excellent news is Shabazz made a very bad move. Shabazz. You killed me on Shabazz. DC just paper-fucking crucified me on Shabazz. Yes, but, Andy, I mean this is going down for 35 years bad. - I mean, life. - Oh, God, Lord, no. Incoming moron. Save me. Quick, quick. - Um, the president called you. - Did he really? - No. - Andy, quick five. Hey, Clay. Just busy. Quick, uh, two seconds? Sure, yeah, just wanna make sure you're on top of this major nuclear threat situation we got goin' on. - Nuclear what? - Oh, you didn't hear? Well, I guess the FBI drops the ball the PD is here to pick it up. So you guys are free to do whatever it is you do down here. - What, did you shit your chest? - Clay. In my office. Start from the beginning. No, I don't think he needs to start from the beginning. What we have here is weapons-grade nuclear material four canisters. Uh, no threat. Being traded within city borders. Um, no, I don't think so, sir. This just doesn't smell right to me. Are you saying there are actual mushroom-cloud nukes here in Miami? No, he's not saying that and if you are saying that, you're mistaken. I worked nukes a lot in intel. This isn't them. Easily done, though, buddy. No problem. Don't feel bad. This is serious, Madam Agent. Canisters of uranium. Have you checked they're full? 'Cause I'll bet they're not. I can tell. Have you checked? No. He's not even cleared to hear how he's fucking this up. I might have to ask him to reprimand you. We don't have this at my PD. I'm gonna have to ask him to reprimand you. He can't reprimand me. I'm a different agency, sweet cheeks. You wouldn't last one second here. The only thing smaller than your badge is your dick. It's probably inverted like a belly button. [laughs] I'm sorry. They will do that from time to time. Just so you know, under state law I'm taking control of this in city borders. - Permission not granted. - Permission not asked. We've already gone up the line to Homeland. Seriously, dude, you're gonna look like such a fucking goober. Andy, this idiot has no idea what he's doing. He probably mounts the toilet the wrong way around. You know, you have to face away from the wall, right? Okay, okay. Now I do have to issue a reprimand. Well, I don't accept your reprimand. Agent, it's done. It happened the minute I said it. No, it didn't land. I stopped it from landing. Okay, I will accept your reprimand but you have to accept my refusal. There it is. We're settin' up the takedown. No, okay, look. There are no nukes. There are no nukes. 'Cause the canisters are mine. They're empty. This is the same thing I was trying to tell you about before, out there. This is the same thing. So this is good. Okay, there may be some new info. Can we just hold off until we.. Yeah, here's the new info. I got four undercovers posing as a Nazi cell. They caught your freaks in a honey trap and now you're pissed off that I'm ahead of you. Uh, no, Clay, you're not listening. - Okay, I'm listening. - Okay. Uh, the canisters don't contain nuclear material. If the target thought they did, if the target believed that he was trading actual nukes, we could arrest him. Okay, so that's what we're doing. No, because right now the target knows that they're empty. Doesn't track. Just so you know, this action can only be countermanded by someone of requisite rank who is fully on top of the facts not playing catch-up from a chipmunk. A chipmunk? Seriously? What if I shot him? I mean, I'm kidding. But it would end this if I did shoot him, which is a joke. You know, Cheryl and I have our anniversary dinner tonight at Nobu. I told her I'd go this year. That's great, sir, but, um, you need to call him off otherwise we're gonna look like total... Of course, I need to call him off. You know, Kendra, first you bring me Shabazz and then you take the case away from me and then you give him nukes. Yeah, I was just trying to find a way to prevent Shabazz from going on the open market and getting actual nukes. And, alright, it would have worked... I'll need, I'll need your case file and your informer's contacts. I'm being stood down? No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No. No. No, no, no, no, no. I'll buy your wife flowers. No, that's weird. I'm gonna.. I will find this Nazi takedown thing. [intense music] Okay, we just give 'em the canisters take the money, everybody's happy. - So what if we get nervous? - Nervous is good. Nervous will make them think that the fake nukes are real nukes. You just gotta be nervous like you're holdin' nukes not nervous like you're not holdin' nukes, yeah? [intense music] We've got the surveillance plane feed. - Uh, this is the takedown. - Yeah. The police chief's not answering. Uh, no, I'm on it. - Well, what's he saying? - He's not pickin' up. - Then why did you say... - Hey, Rick. Come on in. Thanks for coming. Uh, have some cake. Oh, no. I'm just comin' to the edge of your shit pit. I'm not jumpin' in. [intense music] - Clay. - Hello, Andy. Okay, you have to call this off. That is a federal order. - You wanna play rabbi? - Nope. Well, my rabbi trumps you, buddy. My rabbi's head of Homeland Security. Hello, Andy? I can't.. - Clay, don't even think of... - Breakin' up! - What an idiot. - Jesus. Clay? Hello? Cla.. God! Uh, we can call the lead undercover Nazi directly. - Yes. - He's got to have a cell phone. - Do it. - Okay, it would be somewhere.. Try not to spend this all on grape soda. Try not to knock these over makin' the beast with your sister. Okay. Uh, I don't know which number is which Nazi. Well.. Check it out. You can, well, call one at the same time as me. If you get through, just give him to one of us. - And dial. - What the fuck do I say? It's just ringing. [cell phone ringing] Ignore it. [cell phones ringing] Ignore the fucking phones. [indistinct chatter] - Do something. - I'm trying. Jesus. Shit. - I'm through. Stand down. Look. - Hello, sir. This is the FBI Special Agent In Charge Andrew J. Mudd. - Yes, sir. - I need you to let the targets go. - Bismillah Black Santa Jesus. - Comply immediately. Yes, sir. Stand down. Everyone, stand down. Guns down. - Okay. - Let 'em up. You can get up. Yeah, I'm a cop. Get on up. What about the brown guy? - Uh, you can have him. - Not you. You're goin' to jail. - Wait. - Take him away. Someone's got friends in the FBI, huh? Go. So you do have a sasquatch dick. Of course, I have. - Yeah. - Of course, I have a big dick. - Right call, sir. Need a hand? - No, we don't. - Knock next time, please. - We're good, thank you. So, uh, I am back on for Nobu. Some yellowtail.. ...and then some Cheryl tail. Are we safe? We can't be safe. - No such thing as safe. - I think we're safe. - So they're not comin' after us? - Yes, that's right. After 500 years, they just stopped comin' after us. I don't think they're comin' after us. So we're free? Better than free. They arrested Ruben, so we got the farm back. So what the fuck happened? I don't know what happened. I was, I was praying my ass off and then that happened. You made that happen? I don't know. Maybe it was the horse. That horse back there. The horse did that? I think God was working through my horse when he blew up the cranes. I'm definitely gettin' a horse. [engine starting] [intense music] [engine revving] [music continues] - Uh, sir? - Uh-huh. I think the cops are following Shabazz. Oh, you know, couple of patrol cars to see him off. You know, Clay is a bad loser. It's a fuckin' archipelago. [sirens wailing] [dramatic music] [sires wailing] [cell phone beeping] Shitty fucking Jesus! What's up? Nobu run out of starfish? No. It's reached the Oval Office. Clay has caused Homeland Security to declare a nuclear emergency on your empty canisters. Well, he's having some kind of breakdown. [groans] - Alright, we're takin' over. - Whoa-oh. Right, okay, what do you need from me, sir? Right, well, we know this emergency is groundless. - Correct. Right. - But the emergency exists. And you can't take control of something if you're saying it doesn't exist. Okay. So we have to acknowledge that the emergency exists. Uh, oh, yeah, well, n... no. Sorry, if we say, "Yes, it exists" isn't that the same as declaring a nuclear emergency ourselves? Uh, technically yourself, but, yeah. So... to stop a nuclear emergency I have to declare a nuclear emergency? Yes. The logic only works if you say it slowly. Keep the contradictory elements apart. - Well, I would look insane. - Only if you say it fast. And also, you already looked insane when you met me in the parking lot. So you're just gonna throw her under the bus? No. I would never do that to an agent. She has to do it herself. And the alternative is dancing in the woodchipper. But then this stops? If you tell me to go "Chicken Little" I have control over the cops, over everything. Then I guess we have a nuclear emergency. Good play, agent. I'm calling in a full-armed response. I hope her record will reflect the bravery not the foolishness of what she just said. - Is the woodchipper better? - No, the same. Right, control. We have to keep this off the TV. Uh, sir? - I said, knock. - Sir.. Yes, sir, but, um.. You got Miami-Dade black and whites out there sheriff's cars, dog vehicles. We're looking at a.. Ah.. Um, Kendra, can you give us a second? Just.. Yes, sir. Um.. Thank you. - Right. - Yeah. [dramatic music] Whoo! [sirens wailing] [cell phone beeps] Um, okay, they're heading to a donut shop. - Yep. Are we good in there? - Informant's in place. - What's that? - Oh, we got in there with the.. - Who's, who's where? - Okay, here's what it is. We need to arrest Shabazz for creating a nuclear threat. But we can't do it for that so we need him to do something else. And given the state of this case so far it might just be better if he got shot. No, sir... Angels walk on tightropes, Kendra. Disclosure of this snafu in court would cause more damage to national security than a shooting that's basically just another shooting. Don't worry. It won't sound so brutal on your record. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] Thank you. Hello. My sister. She is my sister. Happy birthday! Here he is. Daddy? Happy birthday, baby girl. Vee, we got the farm. - Ruben's gone. - What? - We're good, I swear to God. - Really? - Yes. - No more guns? No more bullshit? No more guns. No more bullshit. - We sweet like caramel cream. - You swear? On my own personal donuts. - Both your donuts? - The chocolate ones. Okay. [chuckles] [sirens wailing] [helicopter whirring] So, I'm gonna have to tear both of your nuts off. No, this can't be for us. This gotta be for somethin' else. For what? Like a food inspection? Like somebody just saw a fly on a cinnamon twist? Jesus. Look at this. This thing's bulletproof, right? There will be no shooting. Kendra. Kendra. - Hey, guns down. - Kendra. Everybody, guns. - Get your guns down. - Agent Chipmunk. You better put on a nuke suit or get the fuck out of here. Can't hear you, Clay. Just keep it on, alright? Andy, your rabbi won. This is your emergency. - Wrong again, Clay. - Well... We only called the emergency because we knew there wasn't one. - What? - That's right. She just said it too fast. [sirens wailing] Which part of your broken ass did you pull this out of? I ain't pulled this out of my ass, Vee. Wait. Look. I... I know her. From where? Bumblefuck, Alaska? Listen, maybe she can help. Go see. Hey. Hello! Threat is mobile. That's him. That's it. The threat is mobile. - Can I come over? - Great, great. Let him come. I'll arrest him when he gets here. For what? For wearing a shower curtain? Kendra, we can't arrest him for something until he does something we can arrest him for. But you made me call a national emergency on someone I can't even arrest, Andy. I should be arresting myself for this. Hello. Ma'am! This could be a trick. What kind of trick? A Taliban-type trick. A man who is actually a bomb. [gunshots] [all screaming] Hey! He's unarmed. Unarmed black man. Unarmed white man. Which one's more likely to have the gun? [clattering] Clay. Stand your guns down. I'm memoing this. Guns down! All guns down. - Thank you, sir. - No problem. Oh, okay, right. Our guns. Bigger. More accurate. Good. Sir, the eight seconds we just had with no guns felt really good. Shots were fired, Kendra. There's no telling how Shabazz could retaliate. Snipers and perimeter are set. - Have your entry in position. - Right. - That's the ISIL general? - ISIL general, yeah. Oh, yeah, he could throw a bar of soap at us at any second so.. See, they didn't arrest us back there because they think it's gonna be a lot more fun to shoot us. [foghorn blowing] It's just the horn they use to summon the dinosaurs. [clattering] Everyone good? - We're good. We're good. - No, not good, brother. - Shopkeeper? - I see my friend in trouble.. - I bring help. - Whoa. Wha.. This is your plan? It's fake. Oh, thanks, Stevie. Twenty-five years if he tries to use that thing. Thirty-five, you fuckin' prolapse. No one gets hurt. This is his Get-Out-Of-Jail card. His Get-Out-Of-Jail card is going to jail? My sheikh is very happy for you to use the device, Sultan. I'd be happy to use it to make sure you never sit down again. Please, save yourself. Brown cracker's right, Sultan. Or we're leavin' in zip bags. Okay. Mashallah, brother. Reza the shopkeeper? - You're under arrest. - What? I'm arresting you for attempting to supply illegal missile things. Ugh. Oh, my God. Vee, read him his rights. You have the right to remain. You may not say anything you say you will be held against you. And the thing about the lawyer. Do you understand your rights? No. Do you understand these rights? Yes, yes. Very clear. That crossbow's a threat. The toy crossbow? You can kill a dog with one of those. Okay, so I'll arrest him for having a dangerous toy. Hey, wait. No. We arrest now, the jury's with Shabazz. Alright, well, this only goes one way. Entry squad. It's time for the arterial Hail Mary. The red-ink amen. Okay. I'm arresting him anyway. - For what? - I don't know. Trying to summon the fucking dinosaurs! Kendra! So we're good with this? - Yes. - Okay. [gasps] Taxi. Are we still good now that I shot him in the head? No! No! Everybody get down! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Hands up. - Oh, shit! [indistinct yelling] Hey, don't shoot! No shooting! Moses Sultan Al Bey Al Shabazz, AKA David Ford Edwards I'm arresting you on charges related to terrorism. You can put that down. It's fake anyway. Me? Wh... what charges? Uh, behaving in a way to cause a man to be shot in the head with a toy which is worse than it sounds and planning to overthrow the government with an army. - Four people? - It's a small army. And... and intending to procure WMDs which for a certain amount of time you definitely intended to procure. Among other charges. You can put that down. I told you, it's fake. - But he.. - He works for us. Lollipop. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights as I've explained them to you? Moses, do you understand? You know I made lightning strike the cranes, right? - Lord have mercy. - It happened, Vee. And I made the cops put down their guns with the help of a horse. Right, brothers? - Yeah. - Mm-hm. Really, y... you didn't. We did. And did you put my horse out there? - Thought so. - Mo! - We good, we good. - Fuck, Moses... Almighty Allah, charge this weapon. No. Moses, stop. - You'll be okay. - It's fake. Don't hurt 'em, just... just make the tube thing knock 'em over so we can leave. - Please. - He can't do that, obviously. Bring them to their knees and turn their guns into whistles. You're making this so much worse. - May we go? - Just nice and easy. - Put it down. - May we go? Moses, come on. He says it won't hurt. Don't push the button. [button clicks] [mellow music] Andy, fourth circuit. They'll take it. Okay. Put it down. Great. Kendra? We're flying him to Virginia. I have to fuck you up a little bit right now, okay? Okay, ma'am. [grunting] She'll be okay, right? Communities? Yup. Ah! Oh! [grunting] They would've shot him. [helicopter whirring] Wait, wait.
