[music playing] Uncle Cal, when will Santa Claus be here? Yeah, we're sure awfully tired. Well, I'm afraid he isn't going to come until after you're in bed and sound asleep, kids. And it's just about time you kids were in bed anyhow. Can you tell us a story first? Yeah, a Christmas story. I want to hear about mean old Mr. Scrooge. I want to hear about the littlest angel. Well, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'll tell you what. How would you like to hear a brand new, never-before-told story of Christmas? A story that no one ever heard? That's right. Now, that actually happened to me when I was a forest ranger in Yellowstone National Park. That was many years back. Say, you climb up here on my lap. And I'll tell you all about it. Here we go. Oh boy, a new Christmas story. That's right, a brand new Christmas story. [music playing] I suppose old Nana the bear and her cubs are about bedded down for the winter. Yoo-hoo? Anyone home? Hiya, Mr. Ranger. Hey, Mom, Mr. Ranger is here! Whoops! Hey! Look out! Whoops! Sorry, Mr. Ranger. Oh, that's all right, kids. I'm used to an unusual welcome around here. About ready to call it a season, Nana? [yawning] That's for sure. I was just about to tuck the cubs in for the winter. Oh, we don't want to go to bed. Typical kids. Yep, we're not worth a darn without a good four month sleep. Oh, I hope my lumbago doesn't act up this winter. [creaking] I guess middle age is creeping up on you. So long, have a pleasant winter. Goodbye, Mr. Ranger. Oh, Chinook, Nakomi, come on in. It's hibernation time. Coming, Mom. So long, Mr. Ranger. Oh, Nakomi? Chinook? Coming, Mom! Sure looks like it's gonna snow. Ah, the first snowfall of the winter. It's almost that time of the year again. Sleigh bells and snowmen, yep, soon it'll be Christmas day. Which reminds me, about time I went out and cut me down a pine Christmas tree. There's something wonderful about this time of the year. It makes a man feel good about living. Warms him up deep down inside and all over. [SINGING] Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. [humming] Who wants to sleep when it's snowy all over everything? Nakomi! Chinook! Are you kids coming to bed? In a minute, Mom. Look, Chinook. It's Mr. Ranger! Wonder what he's doing out in the snow. Let's go find out. Whoa! Hey, this one's perfect-- about the right size and height too. What the! Oh my! [crashing] We're awfully sorry, Mr. Ranger,sir. Wh-- wh-- what happened? Well, we kind of got all snow balled up. Nakomi and Chinook, I might have known. You cubs get into everything, even snowballs. Hey, you kids better get home and start hibernating. You know how your mom is. She can be a real bear when she's angry. I made a funny! [laughter] Now, stand back, kids! What you're going to do with that axe? Why, I'm going to cut down this Christmas tree. What's a Christmas tree? And what's a Christmas? Oh, Christmas is-- well, uh, Christmas is a time for good cheer, singing carols and exchanging gifts. Everyone is bubbly and happy. People are at their best around Christmas time. Sounds like fun. How come we never had a Christmas? Oh, well, I suppose it's because you're bears. And bears hibernate through Christmas. [chopping] Timber! What else happens at Christmas, Mr. Ranger? Oh, lots of wonderful things-- marshmallow roasts, dance around a warm fireplace, playing games. Well, it's been nice. But you better be getting home before your mom misses you. Chinook? Nakomi? Will you please come home? We must get some sleep. Coming, Mom! Let's ask her about Christmas. Hey Mom, wake up! We want to talk to you! [grumbling] Tell us about, Christmas, please? Huh? What's a Christmas? You know, presents and candy. And lots of goodies! Uh, well, I really don't think I know much about it. [sighing] Awe, come on, Mom. Mr. Ranger told us this was the best time of the year. Why, of course it is, children. That's when we get our sleep. Quick! Grab her! No, you, she's out like a light. Maybe Mr. Ranger has a Christmas at his house that we can see. Come on! [music playing] Let's take the shortcut. We can cut across the lake. It's frozen over! Sure slippery. Yikes! How do you stop? Look out! [laughter] Come on, Chinook. Mr. Ranger's cabin is just over the hill. [crashing] Golly, look. Look what Mr. Ranger did to his tree. It's beautiful. He's fixing his cabin up with all kinds of pretty decorations. [SINGING]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. [humming] Bless my hat, I just get all choked up at Christmas. Oh, hi, Nakomi and Chinook. Nakomi and Chinook? But they're in hibernation, I think. What on Earth are you cubs doing here? We came to hear all about the Christmas fun everyone has while us bears are sleeping. Look! Look at tree! And look at the presents! Oh boy! Shiny balls and sparkling stuff! [thwap] Wait, you two, stay out of my decorations, please! Yippee! Yahoo! Hooray for Christmas! Now, kids, try to control yourselves. Hey, Chinook, look over here! Little white tasty looking mushy things! I bet they taste just great! As a matter of fact, they do, but just one, Chinook. Me too, Mr. Ranger? Of course. Really, you cubs should be home. Your mother will be worried sick. But we want to hear all about Christmas. Yeah, we never had one of them. Tell us about it, Mr. Ranger, please? Huh? Pretty please with honey no it? Well, now-- wait a minute, kids! Oh, tell you what, if I let you in on the story of Christmas, will you promise to go home? We promise, cross our hearts! OK, fine. Well, let's see. It all began a very long time ago. Something very wonderful happened. A little child was born to the family of Mary and Joseph in a place called Bethlehem. Is that in Yellowstone Park? Oh no, it's far, far away. But anyway, this little child brought a gift to the world of peace on Earth and goodwill toward men. And even to this day, people still give presents on this child's birthday, which we call Christmas. And over the years, many legends built up around Christmas. What kind of legends? Oh, I guess the most famous one is the story of Santa Claus. What's a Santa Claus? Can we eat it? [laughter] Oh, no, no. Here, maybe I can explain it to you more easily with a pencil and paper. First of all, this is where we live. It's called the world. You mean it's round? That's right. And at the very top is a place known as the North Pole. And this is where a little old man with a belly that shakes like a bowl full of jelly lives all year long with his eight reindeer and many, many little helpers called elves. What do the elves do up there? Well, it's said they work all year long making toys for Santa Claus to deliver to children all over the world on Christmas Eve. [music playing] And so, with Santa on his way, kids everywhere wait happily for Christmas stockings filled with goodies. Gee, what a beautiful, pretty story. Well, you cubs better be getting on home. Oh, thank you, Mr. Ranger. That was a terrific story. Good, now run along home, kids. Bye, Mr. Ranger. Bye, see you next springs. [laughter] Cute little kids, those two. Maybe Mom will let us have a Christmas. She might even let us stay up until Santa Claus comes, if we ask her real nice and sugary. Hey, look! Do you see what I see, Nakomi? Oh, boy! A beautiful little Christmas tree! Wow, it must be the prettiest one in Yellowstone Park. Come on. Let's take it home! But how? It won't shake loose. Maybe we can break it off. Keep tugging, Nakomi! I think it's gonna snap! [crash] Oh, it's too big a tree. You mean we're too little. What's a Christmas without a Christmas tree? Hey, wait! Mom could break that tree off in two seconds. Come on, Chinook! Wake up! Yoohoo, Mom! Hey, Mom, wake up! Uh, what is it? Avalanche? A forest fire? What? Can we have a Christmas tree, Mom? A what? You know, a Christmas tree like Mr. Ranger has. Listen, children, I hate to be angry. But you should have been asleep weeks ago. But, Mom, just one teensy little Christmas tree? Please, Mom? I'm sorry. It's almost a month past your bedtime already. Oh! Oh, all right, but you must promise to remain in the cave for the rest of the winter. We promise, Mom! We do! We do! Yippee, we're going to have a tree! Hooray, we found a beauty just down the slope, Mom. I'm going. I'm going. The problems of motherhood, I've got a feeling it's going to be a long winter. Whoopee! Well, let's get the old cave ready for our Christmas tree. I guess this is the tree the kids want. Isn't it a terrific Christmas tree, Mom? I'm glad you're happy with it, kids. Maybe now we can get some sleep, hm? [SINGING]Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh! Yippee! Hooray for Christmas! We want Santa Claus! Now, now, listen, kids, I don't want to spoil the fun, but this noise simply cannot continue. Just what is all this Christmas stuff all about anyway? Oh, it's terrific, Mom! Yeah, a fat holly old man in a sled is going to bring us some presents. Yeah, and his big old belly shakes like a bowl full of jelly! [laughter] And he comes down the chimney and says, ho, ho, ho. And how did you kids learn all about this? Mr. Ranger told us. Oh? He certainly can tell some whoppers. Oh no, it's true, Mom. And no matter what, we're going to stay up until Christmas Eve. Oh dear, and just when is this Christmas Eve? Well, uh, we don't know. We sort of forgot to ask. Great, it could be next July. We'll go ask Mr. Ranger, OK? Oh, no you don't. You cubs wait here. I'll have a talk with that Mr. Ranger. I'll find out all about this Christmas business once and for all. Do you think Christmas might be in July? I don't even know when July is. Ah, yes, 'tis indeed the season to be jolly. Uh-oh, good heavens, there's a bear at the door. It's old Nana. Wake up, Nana. [snoring] Huh? What? Wake up, you're, uh blocking my door, dear. What are you doing here anyhow? Oh, I just can't get any sleep with Nakomi and Chinook all excited over this thing called Christmas. They're determined to stay up until Christmas Eve, whenever that is. Oh, I see. But it seems you're the only one who knows when that is. Say, who is Santa Claus, with a bowl full of jelly, and reindeer and all? Well, it's all sort of an old legend? You mean it's not true? Have you been fibbing to my kids? Why, no, not exactly. I thought you bears would be hibernating. Now, how can I hibernate with two cubs all excited over a Santa Claus who isn't even real? I don't mind losing a little sleep. But the kids will be so disappointed. Well, maybe they won't have to be. You know, I used to be an old department store Santa. And I still have my old outfit packed away. Why don't I just show up at your place on Christmas Eve, give a couple of ho-ho-hos, drop off a few goodies, and-- And the cubs will have seen Santa. And we can all bed down for the winter. Oh, I just hope it works, or those cubs will be awfully sad and unhappy. See you tomorrow night, Mr. Ranger. Bye, Nana. I'll be there. You know, this might be fun. It ought to be a real nice old-fashioned Christmas. [music playing] [wind blowing] Ah, Christmas Eve at last. Time for old Santa to make his rounds. Say, I don't look half bad. I don't suppose the real Saint Nick would mind me standing in to bring a little Christmas cheer to Yellowstone National Park. Ho-ho-ho! I guess I've got everything, including a couple of stockings full of goodies for Chinook and Nakomi. Those cubs are in for a real treat. [laughter] [wind blowing] Oh, why did tonight have to be the night for our worst blizzard in years? [wind blowing] Mom! What do you suppose Santa will bring you? Oh, I sort of expect a good winter's rest. I sure wish Santa would hurry up. Yeah! I'm tired. Oh, I'm sure he'll be here soon, kids. Yeah, we don't want to fall asleep. Hey, Chinook! Wake up! Wake up! Do you want to miss seeing Santa? Uh-uh. Remember, Santa is coming, I hope. [wind blowing] It's no use. I got to stop before I get snowed in. I got to wait till this snowstorm passes. [wind blowing] Gee, it's getting awful late. Has it stopped snowing, Mom? Not yet. Gosh, maybe Santa can't get through. Chinook? Wake up. Oh, good, there's an old bus stop for summer visitors. At least it's got a roof. I'll wait out the storm in here. Phew! Where is Santa Claus? I can't stay awake much longer. I'm afraid I'll just have to tell them the sad truth, even if it hurts. Come here, children. Do you think Santa is coming, Mom? Shouldn't he have been here? Well, dears, I'm afraid not. Perhaps it's best you know the truth. Santa is only Mr. Ranger dressed up in a red suit and wearing a false beard. You-- you mean there's no real Santa Claus? No, no, not exactly, it's-- well, it's sort of just a nice old story that the ranger told. But rather than disappoint you, he decided to dress up like this Santa Claus and visit you tonight. But I guess he can't get through because of the bad storm outside. I guess Christmas is for people, not bears. I'm sorry, kids. Gee, no Santa? Besides, well, we're all together in our warm cave. That's sort of nice, isn't it? So let's all go to bed. And we'll talk all about this in the spring. Goodnight, kids. [music playing] Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh, I just wish there was a Santa Claus. [wind blowing] MAN: Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho! Ho-ho-ho! Great, now he shows up. Oh, it's only Mr. Ranger dressed up like Santa Claus. And he's just trying to fool us. Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas to all! And to all a goodnight! He just wanted you to have a nice Christmas, kids. This is the worst Christmas I ever had. Even if it is the only one. Well, it's all over now, kids. Let's try to forget and get some sleep. OK, Mom, goodnight. Goodnight, Mom. [snoring] Oh, dear! It's almost morning. Phew, at last the storm quit. I better get up to those bears. I'm way overdue. [music playing] Oh, I just hope they're still waiting. [clears throat] Anyone home? Santa Claus is here! Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho-ho-ho! Hey, wake up! It's me, Santa Claus! Remember? Santa? But you were already here. Uh, I was? I mean, I wasn't. I just got here. And I brought these stockings full of-- huh? Where did those other stockings come from? Didn't you bring them, Mr. Ranger? Well, no-- I mean, I'm not a ranger. Oh, you know. But how? Because a real Santa Claus was already here. Yippee! Hooray! There is a real Santa Claus! I-- I suppose there must be. Oh boy! And he brought us our Christmas stockings! SANTA: Ho-ho-ho! Up Donner! Up Blitzen! Uh-- what's that? Could it be? It's him! Santa Claus! Look! Up! In the sky Why, it is! It is! It's good old Saint Nick and all his reindeer! Bye, Santa! Bye! Merry Christmas! Isn't Christmas wonderful? Goodnight, Mr. Ranger, and thanks. Yeah, thank you, goodnight. [yawning] Goodnight, kids, goodnight, Nana. See you in the spring. [yawning] Say, do you believe in Santa Claus? [laughter] I sure do. [music playing]
