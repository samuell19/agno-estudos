THE BRIDE OF GLOMDALEN This film is based on the German version "Die brau von Daalenhof" which is somewhat shorter than the original. The rest of the material - which is missing - must be regarded as lost for ever. The inter-titles have been translated based on the German inter-title texts. This reconstruction of the film has been based on the only existing material. The Bride of Glomdalen Tore Braaten had long been a farmhand far away. Now yearning drove him back to his home district. On the other side of the river was his father's farm. Old Jacob Braaten could not keep a farmhand... ...and the farm fell more and more into disrepair. "Now, son, you are finally home again." "Father, I'm staying home now." "I will never toil for strangers again." "I will work in our own fields - I will rebuild the farm." "If you can do that, lad--". Berit, the daughter of the reachest farmer in the district, Ola Glomgaarden, had been Tore's childhood sweetheart. "Have you really no time for me?" "There is so much to do to put the farm in order... I have to work from morning till night." "Do you see any progress?" "The most important thing is missing - a young wife..." "Then you must find one..." "I knew of one, but she probably has not waited for me..." "Then you must ask her, Tore..." "It is too soon, I must get the farm in order first." "Well, then I will not disturb you." "Goodbye, Berit, I will come and visit you on Sunday." On Sunday, rich old Berger Haugsett came to Glomgaarden... to ask for Berit's hand in marriage to his son Gjermund. "But Gjermund would like to know if he will get Berit's hand in marriage." "What do you have to offer?" There are sitting there bargaining about me as though I were a head of cattle. "But I will not let them bargain about me, I will not take Gjermund." "Berit, if you are serious, dare I hope?" "Yes, Tore, I love only you and will have only you." "Where were you?" "I was with Tore." "With the farmhand?" "He is not a farmhand, he has his own farm and will soon have as much land as you." "Forget that boy - Gjermund has asked for your hand in marriage." "What do I care about that." "I have already said 'yes'". But I have not, father!" "I make the decision here, I have already given the vicar notice for the banns to be read in church." "I will not marry him, even if it means I have to leave my home." On Saturday evening all the local youth were dancing on the village green. When Gjermund saw that Berit was dancing with his rival, he was consumed with jealousy. "Stop the fighting, boys." "As far as I concerned the whole district may as well know that it is Tore I love." Next day, Ola heard what had happened, he thought it was high time to put an end to what was going on between the two of them. When Ola reached the other river bank there wa a suprise... in store for him. Instead of wasteland he found beautiful farmland. "I am telling you this business with my Berit has to come to an end!" "The daughter of a Glomgaarden farmer does not marry a pauper. Beril is going to marry Gjermund. I have organised for the banns to be read in church and there will be a wedding this month." The old man kept his word. Two weeks later Ola and Beril left for Haugsett where the wedding was to take place. On the way, they came to a farm... 64 00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,160 and Ola wanted to ask the owner if he would like to attend the wedding. Berit took advantages of this moment to flee. "Father!......." Berit was very ill, and they were extremely worried at the Braathen farm. "If only the doctor would come soon." Tore felt that he was to blame for all the unhappiness that had occured. If he had kept away from Berit, this would not have happened. If Berit were to die, he did not want to live any more. Old Braaten intended to talk to Berit's father, but at the moment any return to Glomgaarden was out of the question. "Are you going to fell logs? Why are you greeting me with an axe?" "What are you doing here?" "I bring greetings from your daughter - she is very ill." "You can return with my greetings, and tell her I no longer have a daughter. She can stay where she belongs-- if that is god enough for her." "You have no reason to talk so contemptously of us! Tore will not get my permission to marry, until you have given your consent." "Then you will wait a long time." "Do what you like, and remember that Berit is under my protection." "Where Berit is, is where her belongings should be-- bring them to Braaten." The news of the accident had spread throughout the district. The vicar's wife came to look after her godchild. "If you are well enought, Berit, come and stay with me at the vicarage." Living under the same roof as Tore made Berit doubtful. She left and went to stay at the vicarage. "Where is Berit?" "I shall find Berit, we will get work in town, and will not bother anyone here." "Talk to the vicar instead, he will advise you." When Tore came out of the vicar's office he knew he had a friend. "I have promised to help the young couple. 94 00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,040 But Berit belongs in her father's house... and Tore must ask for her hand in marriage in a proper manner." Ola Glomgaarden suffered greatly because of the separation from Berit, but due to his stubbornness he could not take the first step. "How are you, Ola?" "It looks luke a pigsty here." "I have to have a serious talk with you, Ola." "You deceived me when you said you had given your blessing to Gjermund's and Berit's marriage." "Did you give your consent?" "If I reported you, the punisment would be severe." "I have decided to perform the marriage ceremony for Tore and Berit." "I need your formal consent and that is why I have come here to speak to you." "Be sensible and say yes-- I will also talk to the Haugsett family." "If only Berit were here with me I would not feel so lonely and abandoned." "Then I can help you-- you will say 'yes' then?" "I suppose I must, when the vicar wants it that way." The vicar was not a man to put a matter of indefinitely. "I must talk to you, Gjermund." "When I read the banns in church for you and Berit, you said both of you were in agreement." "Did you tell me the truth?" "Berit's father wanted it." "And Berit?" "That is to deceive me as a vicar." "If word got out, you would all go to prison." "You will probably think otherwise when you are taken to court." The next day, Berit's chest was brought to Glomgaarden again. For the fist time in a long time Ola received the Braaten family in a friendly manner. For the first time, old Ola shook Tore by the hand. "I think Tore would like to know if he will finally have Berit's hand in marriage." "I thank you, father, I will gladly have him if you give me your blessing." The summer has arrived and the crops are ripe-- the fruit of honest labour. Berit is well again. The wedding day dawns. The landscape is bathing in sunshine. At Glomgaarden there is a great stir. 128 00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,000 The vicar's wife has come to dress the bride herself. Out of the forest came a man with an axe in his hand. It was Gjermund who was driven to this confused action by insane jealousy. "We must hurry... 132 00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,640 maybe we will manage to get the boat before the current takes hold of it." The bridal procession was to meet by the river, and then they would proceed to the village together. "The boats are gone and there are no other boats in the neighbourhood." "I will send a horse over then Tore can cross the river." Tore was afraid he would be crushed between the logs, and let go of the logs he was clinging to-- He would rather go under than be crushed by the floating logs. A few hundred meters away the waterfall roared. Tore felt how the current got hold of him and used his last ounce of strength... to avoid falling prey to the enormous forces of nature. The logs piled up right above the waterfall-- if only he could use one of them to save himself. In his hour of need he managed to get hold of a log-- "Hurry to the church and tell the vicar what has happened." "Dear children, you have now seen that God does not desert those whom He loves." "And you, Ola Glomgaarden, have learned that love... ...is a gift from God we mortals shall not interfere with."
