Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Judging from the smell of gunpowder, it hasn't been long. He's probably nearby. Episode 11 If we catch Choi Hee Gon, and ask him why, and we get an answer, would we no longer feel this way? Has Kang Chang Gil... paid for his crimes? Or, could he be just another pawn controlled and used by Choi Hee Gon... and ultimately sacrificed? Like the others. One thing's become certain... The reason why we can't stop until we capture Choi Hee Gon. We must capture him and ask... Why? What?! The morning? If you're done washing, then hurry into the office and check, please! All we need to know is who leases it out and who occupies it. Yes. To my mobile phone. I'm going to be waiting. Aigoo. What did he say? He's gone home, washed up, and is lying down. It's a murder case, but who cares whether you're on duty or not? Some of us can't even get a change of clothes! All he had to do was hit the keyboard a couple of times. What do the people in the nearby buildings say? The leaser doesn't live here, and they've never even seen the occupant. Have you found anything? No. He got in without breaking down the door, even though it required a code. He found the light stand in one go and turned on the switch. Then, he lifted the phone and called somewhere. I've escaped. Kang Ju Min assisted me. Then, letting go of his tenseness, he falls to his knees here, and leans. He opened the refrigerator door and drank water. What's he doing? - What are you doing? - Ah. I asked what you were doing, with that dumb look on your face. Kang Chang Gil was very accustomed to this place. What? He must have been hurt when he escaped as he left blood in a few spots. On the stand, the phone, the refrigerator. If he had to shuffle around to find things he needed, then there would have been blood on other items. But there were only traces of blood exactly in the areas where he needed something. Rather than go to the office and turn on all the lights, which would draw attention, he used the light on the stand and called Choi Hee Gon to let him know he escaped? Then he opened the refrigerator and drank some water. And not long after that, someone came looking for him. Then, this would be... He's been here frequently before. This might be one of the Black Society's hideouts. It's me. What happened? What happened with Chang Gil? He's dead. He was shot. I suppose it was the Black Society. There was someone who was slipping out at the scene, so we chased him. But, we lost him. If it was going to turn out like this, you should have let me kill him with my own hands. The bastard that killed Mi Hyun was sitting in front of my eyes. You know what it took for me to sit there and smile. I kept thinking of Ha Na's mother's face as I looked at Chang Gil, and I also thought about killing him, killing him and ending it. I was tempted more than once. But you know Chang Gil is just a puppet. It's not over yet. What about clues to the murderer. We're looking for them. We have to hope that we find something. But, what are we going to do about Poseidon? Since Chang Gil is dead, our only route has vanished. What are you talking about? We'll have to find another way. The fact that we're going to find Choi Hee Gon and arrest him hasn't changed. You're right. I'll call you again later. First of all, he was killed by gunfire, having been shot at 4 times. Two bullets pierced the heart, and another hit the left lung. And after he fell, it appears, he was shot again. The last bullet went to the abdomen. So, all together, 4 bullets. So, then it appears, there was no hesitation and the killer had the intent to kill from the beginning. When will the detailed results be ready? CSI is really busy, so it will probably take at least 5 days. When you examined the crime scene, did you notice anything special that stood out? Ah, there was one thing. There were no shells found, not one. The shooter probably collected them right away. Why would... If you examine the shells, you can sometimes uncover the kind of gun or even a serial number. Still, it's not common for a killer to pick up the shells at a murder scene. That sort of composure and presence of mind means that it's someone very experienced. Or a complete psychopath. Director Han, were you aware of this operation? Yes. As the quickest way to get to Choi Hee Gon... So, sticking a tracking device in his belly and setting him loose, did you think he'd race over directly to Choi Hee Gon? Director Han, when you asked for authority over Division 9, I had hoped you would restrain Captain Kwon when necessary and strengthen the team. But, what is this? Captain Kwon. Yes, sir. If it appeared the operation was too risky, you shouldn't have even started. Either that or you should've put together a more precise plan and even if it seemed foolproof, checked it again and again. There's a limit to how much I can protect you. It doesn't look good to the other agencies. And we're going to have to satisfy the media's call to take responsibility for our mistakes. Kang Ju Min. - Yes. - Whatever the case may be, you failed in transporting the criminal. He escaped in front of your eyes. Do you have anything to say? No, sir. Captain Kang Ju Min will be put on suspension indefinitely. - Take care of it. - Yes, sir. I'll do whatever I can to get you reinstated as soon as possible, so just rest in the meantime. What's wrong with you two? Have you lost all of your spirit just because the Commissioner said a few things? You're not going to go after Choi Hee Gon anymore? - Should we give up? - We can't do that. Now that we've gone and set up the game board like this, we can't even easily quit now. Live or die, come or go, even if we just stick it out on bravado alone, we absolutely must put someone away for this to end! Captain Kwon, keep your head clear. Yes, sir. So, what cards do we have left in our hand? We have a phone number that Chang Gil called from his phone. It was under the name of Captain Lee Jung Woong. That makes sense. The Black Society could have used the names of the missing or deceased to set up phones and create accounts with fake identification. We've investigated the registration for the phone number, and it led to a textile dyeing company. And they handle the largest amount of acetic anhydride in the nation. What? Acetic anhydride? Acetic anhydride... the compound used in making heroin? Yes. If they use it to manufacture drugs, they can get 10 or 20 times the return on investment. So every year, the number of uncovered smuggling cases increases. I believe that the Black Society wouldn't ignore such a profitable enterprise. It will be hard to get a warrant just based on a hunch. - We're looking further into it. - What else? We've found the shelter where Kang Chang Gil lived until he was in middle school. If you dig deeper into those two leads, do you think you'll find something? We must. Fine. Push forward. If someone else has to take responsibility again for our movements, it will be me. If they ask me to resign, I will. If they ask me to hang my head in shame, I will. So, don't stop. I'm saying don't make it so those people became sacrificed in vain. Got it? - What are you going to do? - What do you mean? Since I was suspended, I'll have to go home and rest. From what Kim Seon Woo said, Jung Deok Su is thinking of betraying Choi Hee Gon. Even though he said the opposite to me in words, I got a similar feeling from him too. If Jung Deok Su still believes you're connected with Choi Hee Gon, we may be able to get a lead that way. Why don't you see him? All right. I've got lots of time now. I'll go see him. I'm sorry. The phone number Kang Chang Gil called as soon as he got in... That's the most important clue. We're looking into it now, but judging from the way they've operated up to now, it's got to be a phone registered to a fake ID. The license plate on the truck the killer fled in also can't be traced. All the phones and vehicles with fake registrations, geez. Why didn't I check out the guy's face that night? A guy creeping out with a hat pulled down should have been checked out no matter what. You don't think you could remember enough to even get a composite drawn? No. Because I wasn't really paying attention, I can't remember his face at all. Maybe you actually did see it and just saying you didn't. Are you BS-ing maybe? There's a time to joke and a time not to. This isn't a time to joke. Sorry. Oh. What happened? Captain Kang Ju Min was put on suspension. What? Then, do we have to stop now too? No. Director Han ordered us not to stop. He said if something happens again that requires someone to take responsibility, then he'd be the one taking responsibility. Wow, our Director is pretty impressive. Hey, Min Kyuk. You should watch and learn. Ah. What happened with the inquiry into the landlord? Yes, I found the contact information and called, but I haven't been able to connect yet. I'm planning to go to the address. Are there any clues that the landlord is somehow connected to the Black Society? We'll look into it. You're doing a comparison of what's being imported to the amount utilized, right? I'm working on it. They could have it worked out perfectly in the documents. But I'm certain, there must be a clue left in there somewhere. I'm counting on you. - And the two of you... -Yes. -Yes. Go back to that shelter where Kang Chang Gil lived. Find out everything you can about Kang Chang Gil. How he grew up, who he followed, and if there were any people that wanted to adopt him. Yes, sir. It's tiring, isn't it? Go ahead and snooze for a bit. I do get tired of it. Like I'm swimming in the ocean toward an island, but even though I go and go, I don't feel I'm getting any closer. Like there's a wave pushing me away from the island. Was it like this 3 years ago too? Every time we got one step closer to the Black Society, more people would die as though it were a warning. And from everywhere, we got pressure to stop the investigation. What I'm worried about is what happens next. Up to now, it's only been Ahn Dong Chul and Park Chil Seong. But from here on, people we know around us could also be in danger. From what you're saying then, I guess, if we stop, then Choi Hee Gon will stop killing. If there's no one to confront him, then he'd stop. Here it is. [Father, deceased, Younger Sibling, deceased...] [Name: Kang Chang Gil. 11/23/89 (about 5:00 AM)...] Were you here back then? Do you remember him, by any chance? It was about when I was a general social worker. When he was released from the hospital and brought here, he couldn't properly use his left hand for a while after he suffered frostbite. Frostbite? He came over the ocean on a small fishing boat. His father died on the boat, and his younger sibling, who had arrived alive, died of pneumonia. Before he came to the center, they had to tear him away from his younger sibling's corpse. After he arrived here, he didn't speak much. Were there any peers here he was close to or an adult that he followed? I don't remember him interacting much with his peers. He wasn't really close to any of the volunteers who served here either. After he graduated from middle school, it says that he disappeared from the shelter. Was there anyone that might have taken him? Maybe someone who had brought up adoption? No. There were other children besides Chang Gil that couldn't adapt and left the shelter, but in my recollection, Kang Chang Gil was the one child that couldn't socialize with anyone. Chase me! Huh? Hi Hyung! Hey, Myung Hwa, look over there! - Hyung! - Unnie! Let's go play. Myung Sik, eat up. Myung Hwa, Myung Sik, you came again today. - Hello. - Hello. These kids like jjajangmyeon (noodles in black been sauce) better than sweet and sour. I guess they come often? Aren't you volunteers at the shelter? Us? Well, I guess you could say that. When the Director comes, he brings all of the kids here for lunch. When you say the Director, do you mean... You know, the man that's always smiling. Ah, that's right. That... Is it a long time that man has been around here? Since it was when the shelter opened, it's probably been around 20 years. Wow. That long? You must not have picked up on it, but it was also through the Director's help that I finally got settled here. My two children lived at that shelter. Our family all defected from North Korea. When we lost all our money and ended up on the streets, if we hadn't met the Director, I don't know what would have happened to us. The four of us. So, my husband and I call the Director "Father." Our Director has many children like that. Please enjoy your food. Eat up. - Did you have fun? - Yeah. Unnie will come visit again. Have fun, okay? - You too, Myung Sik. - Okay. - Go on in. - Bye. - Bye! - We'll be back! Yeah, Hyung. I caught a big one, Seon Woo. What is it? That fabric dyeing factory you talked about. Just a second, Hyung. - Where are you right now? - The harbor near the factory. Wait. I'll be right there. Yeah. Where are you going? I asked a sunbae (senior) from my hometown a favor. To look into GML Korea. Investigator Oh is looking into that. That hyung's investigation style is a little different from Investigator Oh. I guess you could say it isn't limited by the law. Get in. I'll take you to headquarters before I go. No. I want to go too. Let's go directly. [Osung Construction/Machinery] What is it you need to ask me? I'm a busy man. Is it this person? - It's him. - Look at it carefully! I'm telling you it's him! What lousy luck. Why'd he have to go and die in my building? So, the man in this picture, at the beginning of the year, paid you for a year's lease? Why do you keep asking the same questions? You must not know this, but if this office was used for criminal activity, it could become a problem for the person who leased it out too! I told you I didn't know. There are lots of offices that do business like that here in the outskirts of town. He said he wanted to use it and handed me all this cash. So, why would I have made any sort of fuss about it? Even so, who would lease to someone without knowing anything about him? Who would? I would. But, I don't have to return the cash from the guy or anything, right? I can't believe this guy! Someone has died! Forget about it. You don't have any other contact information of anything? I don't, I don't! If you're done asking your questions, why don't you leave? And since the lessee has died, there's no problem if I lease it to someone else, right? - This guy is really... - Ay, c'mon. Whoa! How can a person be like that? Is money everything? I ought to just dig up his background! That's enough of that! Just let it go now. Anyhow, this is a problem. I don't think we're going to get anything else out of this place. I'm telling you we need to dig up his background. Dig up what background? Oh! That guy is such trash! That devil is dead? I helped him escape when he was being transferred. But in a place that seemed like a hideout your guys use, he was killed. Shot by a gun. Right now, you and I are like kites without strings. Where? Where did he die? In an office that no one knows who rented it. If there's anything you know, tell me everything. So that whatever it takes, I can meet Chairman Choi Hee Gon. That's not it. If the Chairman had any intention of contacting you, you would have been contacted in some way. If you haven't been contacted, that means the Chairman... has discarded you. Is there really no way to contact him other than Chang Gil? I absolutely can't let it end like this. There's still a lot of they owe me, for my betraying the Coast Guard. There's no way? There's another safe house. - Safe house? - Where organization leaders can contact the head office if they get in trouble. However, if you take that path and the Chairman didn't want that, you could die. Just like that devil, Chang Gil. So what should I do? Should I tell you anyway? -Hyung. -Yeah. She came with you, eh? So, tell me. Is it all right? We're investigating it together. That textile dyeing factory you asked me to check out... They are unmatched in the country when it comes to using acetic anhydride. I know. We looked into that too. How and how much they are smuggling out too? Engine oil. And this time they're smuggling out about 2 tons. Excuse me? Car engine oil? It's used in cars and also other equipment. They switch cans and export it. You know the old switcheroo. Do you know what region it's getting exported to? It goes through Vietnam, but the ultimate destination is Laos. Laos? How did you find out all those details? We went into the factory too, but couldn't pick up on anything. I have quite a lot of friends. After crossing about 2 degrees of separation, I found a guy who supplies them with engine oil containers. Why would a fabric dyeing company need that many empty oil containers. The answer's clear. That alone isn't enough. If they're smuggling out the solution, we have to get their site. Do you really think I would have called you down here if that was all I got? Then? The ship that's taking out the engine oil is heading out the day after tomorrow. - From here? - Yes. I have to dig a little more to get the exact time and spot. The building owner didn't know anything about Chang Gil or the Black Society. He said it's common for buildings to be leased for 3 to 6 months with a prepayment. Also, we couldn't find any information on the phone that Chang Gil called. The phone in that office, for the last few months, only called local food delivery places and untraceable phones. The CEO and largest shareholder of GML Korea has 3 stars. (slang for 3 time convicted criminal) - Excuse me? - His name is Lee Kwon Hyuk. And he's probably a puppet figurehead. Wow, but still, it doesn't seem that investigating them will be easy. What did you find out about their use of acetic anydride? They've never been caught in quarterly audits, and on paper, there is no sign of any margin between the quantity procured and quantity used. But the strange thing is the amount of fabric procured. In relation to the amount of acetic anhydride procured, it's incredibly small. If they used the acetic anhydride on just the procured fabric, it means that roughly 10 tons remain unused. If it's 10 tons, that's no error. They've intentionally not used it. If they made heroin with 10 tons... If they used all 10 tons for the synthesis of heroin, that would be worth 800 billion won. 800 billion? That's just under a trillion. However, if they announce that the fabric was used in remanufacturing, there's no way to confirm it. I think we'll be able to catch them at the scene smuggling out the acetic anhydride. You have some other information? I asked a sunbae back home to look into it just in case. He's a good source of information. We're told that they package it as engine oil and smuggle it out. What about time and location? He said he'd dig into it a little more and give me a call. Oh! Why are there no people tonight? Have they all gone somewhere? Oh! Why is business so slow? At this rate, do you have any money left after paying me my salary? You don't, do you? I suppose Su Yoon contributes some money to living expenses. I suppose she does, but... What is it you're trying to say? Unnie. You know brother-in-law had his pension. That's not free money, you know. Half of that was taken from his salary. I'm just saying having to forfeit all the benefits is just wrong! I don't want to pull Su Yoon's father's name into an argument like that. His name has been cleared now. Even if you can't collect damages for wrongful death, shouldn't you be able to collect survivor benefits from his earned pension? They took out an amount from every piddly paycheck, and when it's time to collect, they say this and that and make it so complicated. If you're going to keep yapping nonsense, go in and trim the water parsley. Aren't they going too far, really? Brother-in-law, who died a wrongful death, not only doesn't receive a medal, but his survivors can't even collect his own pension benefits! What? What? Have I said anything that was wrong? - I'm home. - Unnie! What... -You haven't had dinner yet, right? -Right. I'm so hungry I could collapse. Go and wash up. I'll set the table for you. Okay. Come see me for a minute. Do you have something you to say to me? Um... Can you do me a favor? - What is it? - Aigoo. If she finds out I've told you this sort of thing, Unnie will shoot lasers from her eyes and beat me. Please speak freely. This family here is so proud. Even if they're starving, they can't say anything that would put others out. So, I have to do it for them. You earn a service pension too, don't you? Yes, I do. They took a bit out of Su Yoon's father's salary all his life, and because he was supposedly involved in corruption, the payments of his survivor pension benefit were suspended. Since his name has been cleared, shouldn't they reverse that? Am I wrong? No. What you say is right. Right? I said something to my Unnie. Even if he can't get a medal, the earned money should be paid. Could you look into it? Sergeant Kim Seon Woo. Did you have something to see General Affairs about? It never even crossed my mind. Though, it's probably pretty important to the people involved. Even though I see their faces every day, I never thought about it either. Granted, there's the pension issue, but it may be even more important to repair that dishonorable history. I'll look into it. Thank you. Also, how's the mood over at Division 9? There's been no big change. We're just chasing for clues to the Black Society. After the death of the man named Chang Gil, Captain Kwon, Su Yoon, and you too, must be rather upset. Captain Kwon isn't one to let his feelings show. Descend softly, land smoothly. Prep for descent. - Descend! - Descend! Descend! - Safe house? - Yeah. They must call it a safe house amongst themselves. Only the leaders know the location and entry code. So Chang Gil did follow the process. But we couldn't find anything in that office. That's probably the case. According to Jung Deok Su, no matter when or where some investigative agency infiltrates, it will be impossible for them to trace anything from those places. Also, there's another safe house. - Jung Deok Su said that? - Yeah. He also said, if Choi Hee Gon doesn't want to meet me and I go look for him, I could die like Chang Gil. If you go there, do you think you'd be able to meet Choi Hee Gon? The probability is low. I'm told that if he needs me, Choi Hee Gon will contact me. This may be the end of Poseidon. Even if it's dangerous, what if I go anyway? No, you can't. You could be in real danger. Also, the investigation up to now could go up in smoke. I think we need to be more cautious about that safe house. Do you think he'll be alright, by himself? You're hometown sunbae who said he'd get on the boat... If GML Korea is connected to the Black Society, he could be in danger. He's pretty deeply entrenched in that world. And if he senses danger, he knows to avoid it. Ah. Since Dae Seong has come, the boarding cost should have been raised, but your mom keeps turning down an increase, saying she just needs to add a spoon, making us feel bad. It's alright. She thinks it's better that the empty room is being used instead of gathering cobwebs. You don't have to worry about that. Still, that's not right. Aigoo, just be good to me, will you? Sergeant Kim! - Speak of the devil. - That piece of work. What a nice picture you guys make. But, I think you need to go somewhere with me. Where? You'll know when we get there. Let's go! We didn't have a lot of opportunity to eat this sort of thing where I lived in my youth. People didn't leave them alone to ripen. Do you know why juice came about? Because there was excess fruit. Instead of letting it rot and waste, they bottled it and started to sell them. But, after they marketed it as being good for your health, it started to sell like wildfire. Though, it's best to eat them fresh. When it comes to surplus, the surplus product is always the issue. For the sake of selling it, half of what you see on TV and newspapers all day are lies. So, who did you say it was? Kim Seon Woo and Lee Su Yoon. They came by the shelter a little while ago as well. And they continue to look into GML. When you've been farming a while, you get the hang of it. If a plant gets infected with bugs, you use insecticide. If you can't get rid of them, you need to pull the whole thing out from the roots, so they don't spread to other plants. But the order is wrong. Jung Deok Su is first. Jung Deok Su stays put in his solitary cell. Even during the one exercise outing each day, he stays in. Jo Jin Guk from Dong Jin Development has also been imprisoned. Who else has run out of luck? Kim Ju Young, Seo In Jun. The four of them. When the sun is blocked by the clouds, it's all right to wait a little while till they pass. For now, I'll find some way. You met with the Western District Prosecutor, right? Are you talking about Prosecutor Park Chang Jun? Pick some ripe ones and send him a carton. I feel we'll be inspected soon, so go and pay some respects. Yes, sir. And, Assemblyman Cha and Chairman Lee have sent their congratulations for receiving the appreciation award. I get that appreciation award every year. If they are in a position to congratulate me, tell them to donate to a shelter or welfare organization. Because, I'm fine. Yes, sir. Do you have something to say? Chang Gil... I took care of him as you asked. Sometimes you pour heart and devotion into something that eventually has to be thrown away. I suppose there's no choice. Inform Chairman Choi. About Chang Gil. - Come on. - What are we doing? - Welcome. - Hello. Where is he? You can get mad at me later. Just have a meal with him. Eh? In a couple of days, he's going back out to sea. Did you get your mother's things? I wanted to keep the house in the country, but they said they were going to tear it all down for development or something. As I was cleaning up, I found those, so I sent them. I thought you'd quit after you left the SSAT, but work is okay? I guess I asked the wrong thing. Have you forgotten why I joined the Coast Guard? Shall I remind you? Why I joined the Coast Guard? Because when Mom didn't come to the surface of the cold ocean for 5 days, when I gave up on her myself, those who never gave up and found her lodged in the boulders were the Coast Guard. And those who apologized for how long it took were the Coast Guard. When you were so busy making rounds at the gambling houses, that there was no way to contact you, the people that pulled Mom out were the Coast Guard. Even when we were putting on the funeral, I prayed to the heavens. That you'd come, even if it was late. That you'd see her off, see her depart with your own eyes. At the time, I was eleven. The age I decided to to join the Coast Guard. It's my burden to carry. My burden to carry even into the next life, my karma. When I go out this time, I think it will be for pretty long time, so I just wanted to see your face before I left. I'm sorry. I'll go. Where's your partner? Tell him to come quickly. Okay, I'll give him a call. He's not answering? No. I'll send him a text message. Sergeant Hong. Enlarge the port area. Yes, sir. We've already relayed it to the situation room and the SSAT. Are you sure this information is accurate? From what I understand, it's information from Kim Seon Woo's personal connection. Seeing as how he knows the details on how they smuggle it out, I feel it's accurate. At this quantity of acetic anhydride, an organization at least the size of the Black Society must be involved. No, at this quantity, it would be impossible for any organization other than the Black Society. What's taking so long? You don't think the Director changed his mind, do you? You think the Director is like you? What about Kim Seon Woo? He says he's on his way. Where'd you disappear to without a word? I'm sorry. Yes, Captain? What about an available vessel or helicopter? I'm continuing to look into it. They have to be perfectly out of view in nearby maritime sharecrop land. Hovercraft, sea vessel, and, if possible, gyrocopter. I will send whatever I can that can get there in time. All right. I'm counting on you. Search for any vessels that can get to Jeonggok harbor. All right. I will bring up a screen immediately. What happened with the SSAT? They've already been dispatched. And the Situation Room is on standby. We're going after them, so lead the way. Yes, sir. Maritime vessel and hovercraft, move to the following coordinates. Please stand by for follow up orders. Move to coordinates 3724 November, 1191 Echo. Gyrocopter, stay on standby on vessel 1507. - You think it'll be all right? - Yes, for now. Since this crime is in the south jurisdiction, the SSAT will provide rear backup. Division 9 and the police squad will make the arrest. Yes, sir. The truck has to arrive and they have to load some of the freight. If we go in before then, they could get out of it. Yes, we'll wait. Do you think they'll really come? They'll come. Won Taek Hyung's information is practically always accurate. Show me the situation on the water as well. Yes, all right. 1500-ton class vessel, 2100-ton class patrol boats, and a hovercraft and helicopter are currently blocking expected escape routes. The gyrocopter is on standby on vessel 1507. A truck is approaching the specified location. Kim Seon Woo, are you ready? Yes. Execute operation. - What is this? - Hey, that the hell is this? You're in room 3, you in room 4. Send some complimentary hors d'oeuvres to room 8. Yes, all right. Why are you here like this? Aren't you going into your room? Oh, that room is no fun. Do we make money by having fun? Do we, huh?! Get in that room now! Oh money, money! Yeah. - Hello. - Dae Seong? What happened? Did they catch 'em? That's an understatement. It was a complete roundup. So they caught a big one, thanks to this Hyungnim, eh? Hey, how is that thanks to you? Our Sergeant Kim did it. That Sergeant Kim, Sergeant Kim racket... you gonna marry him? How about Sergeant Hong instead of Sergeant Kim? Ah, right, I arranged for Sergeant Kim to meet his father yesterday afternoon. Hey, really? Hey, that's the best thing you've ever done. Hey, anyhow, I'm working right now, so I'll talk to you later. Yeah, all right. That kid. Who... That's it. Acetic anhydride. - Captain. - Yeah. These are documents that were in the truck. It is indeed GML Korea. Then, we have justified cause to charge in there, right? Let's go right away. Let me contact the Director and obtain a warrant. Wait just a bit. Thank goodness, really. I was worried that it might be false information. Won Taek Hyung's information is practically always accurate. How is that? Was he a part of a crime organization once? When the warrant comes out tomorrow, we'll charge into GML Korea and I'm going turn everything upside down. Why? That man we confronted there that time really gives me the creeps. What happened?! The number that you have dialed is turned off. Kim Seon Woo! Where are you going? Do you even know where to go?! What's going on? Hey! Where are you going?! Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Translator: meju Timer: momosan Editor/QC: songbill Coordinators: mily2, ay_link How did the Black Society figure out he was investigating GML Korea?
