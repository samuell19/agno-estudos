Oh, here, eat. Put it in my ear. In the other or in my hand. Or in my bottle or in my mouth or in my eyes. As you like, or in my nose. In my heart. Wherever you want, but please. So, in my eye, here. Have you seen a big Kiki? No? Well, we have... Do you want to come? It's for life. Thank you. Well... It was also a Kiki, or a squirrel? Fuck. Three grains of salt Leave me alone, Elsa! Don't you have better things to do? Judith? Juju? Judith? Look what I found. These are magic stones! - Yeah. - Did you eat any? - Taste it, it's salty. - Elsa, it's poisonous, don't eat it! How many did you eat? Two. Ah! You scared me. If you eat three, you die. Nonsense. I swear! If you eat three, you die. Elsa, no! You see? I'm not dying! - You're lying. - It is 11:38 and it will take 6 hours to work so at what time will you die? 2, 3, 4… 5! So at 5.38 p.m. I hope that you've thought about your will. - Hi Jean-Luc! - Hi! No school today? We are sick. Well, mostly her, she's dying. You're the one who signs today? Watch your fingers! It's coffee. It's a kind of coffee for grown-ups. Mama really orders weird things these days. What?! What is this thing? What exactly is a will? It's instructions for your things after your death. I made one where it says that I give you all my books and toys. Even your chemistry set? Yeah, but then if you die before me, I have to change it. How are the stones going to kill me then? So they are absorbing all the water in your body little by little. See your veins there? Well, there's blood inside. Your blood will dry up. And when you run out of blood, you die. The heart doesn't work anymore. Do you know what I mean? What kind of music do you want for your funeral? I think that's important. Finally I found something to eat. Are you hungry? Damn, it's not hard to put the empty stuff in the bin! I swear, I'm tired of her. How about some praline pancakes for the last meal of your life? I'll tell Mama. What do you want her to do? Mama's not here. Don't cry, it will speed up the poison. Your skin is so dry already… Verdet transport and logistics, hello! Hello, can I speak to Sylvia? - It's urgent please. - Please hold. Yes, Judith? Grandma, Judith says I'm going to die soon. What? But aren't you in school now? We're at home and I ate three magic stones. Judith says that if I cry, it will speed up the poison. But I can't stop it's too hard to hold it in. - Elsa, darling... - Please, come. Please, come... No, I can't, darling, I have to work. Is Mum there? Uh... OK, please put your sister on. Judith, Grandma wants to talk to you. I told on you. Hello? What's all this about, what did she eat? It's nothing, we're playing. What is it? It's not Mum's medicine I hope? No. So what is it? It's from the kitchen? From the medicine cabinet? It's something in the kitchen. OK. So where is your mum now? Well… She's sleeping. Sleeping? Is everything OK? - Yes. - How was she last night? Tell me. I just think she was up drawing late last night so we missed the bus this morning but... Look! It's no big deal, right? If she's sleeping, it's fine. It's if she can't sleep that you really need to worry, OK? Uh... really? Well, yes. Come on, sweetie, I have to go back, OK? - Have you eaten? - Yeah... You're right Kiki, we'll take it to see its mum. Come on egg. Come on Kiki. Look, you call me, if there's a problem. You know I'm here. Don't hesitate at all, OK? - Now I really have to go. - Hm. Judith, you're a big girl now, stop messing with your sister, OK? - Yeah. - Yes... You promise? Yes, I promise. Elsa! Elsa, stay with me! You know, if I pass the time limit and I'm not dead, I'm a superhero. Well… Not necessarily the time I told you. It could be a little before, a little after. It depends on many things, the heat, the atmospheric pressure, your medical history... Mama? Mama? Mama! Mama! Mama, where are you? Mama! Mama, come back! Mama! Mama come back please! Mama come back! So girls, are we sleeping in? Elsa? Mama? Come and see. Look who's gonna stop breaking our balls every morning. Do you want to touch? You'll see it's very soft. You can make pillows from it. - Mum? Isn't that Fernand's rooster? - Yeah. I couldn't take it anymore You have to protect your territory, you know. He was such a pain in the arse. It's his fault. Is he dead? Absolutely. The poor guy doesn't move anymore. Oh! Are there any potatoes left? Do you know? But you know what? We take a big pot, put in some potatoes, cut them into chips, we put oil on them, lots of oil. As much oil as possible. And we'll make a huge meal. Weren't we vegetarians, mum? For fuck's sake, what's your problem?! You're never happy! You know it hurts your guts, you get acidity and then, well, you self-digest and disappear. Well, thank you. Fucking hell, Judith... Do you know how long it takes me to fall asleep? I can't be woken up at 5am, OK? I need energy, that's all. It's quite simple. Come on, move Elsa. Move. Girls? Judith! Oh, are you listening to me... You want to eat grass like cows... - He was a pain, wasn't he? - Come on, Elsa. - Killjoy. - Come on. Are you sure you're mine? So... Mama? I am going to die. Well, yes. We are all going to die. We're all going to die, honey. That's the way life is. Can you help me? Come on. Look at your rib cage, do you want to touch it? You see here it's all hard. He is the same. This is the big place where all the organs are. If I try to break through here, I can't. But if I pierce the belly, it's very soft. So, we pull this little skin. Here, take the knife. You cut here... Careful with my fingers. No, I don't want to. - Don't you want to? - No. - Do you want me to do it? - Yes. Yeah. So... I pierce gently and we'll see... There we go. - Oh yeah! - We keep the skin, we'll eat it too. We make recipes with it, you see? We have our two pipes. I've never seen a beheaded rooster. It's not beheaded yet. The pocket is where the guts are. They are connected to his asshole which is there. - If I press some poo comes out. - It doesn't smell good. This is the last thing we'll cut... That's normal, I have an asshole, you have one, everyone has one. Here's his guts, look. - Do you want to watch? - Ew... - Ah, I don't want to see. - Is it true? Don't you? When it comes out it might be a little less gross. Just the noise, it's horrible. How it sounds... Ah, we have a piece of the oesophagus that got stuck. - Gross. - That's why it won't come off. I'll detach it. There we go! Here we can see clearly. Do you see that thing there? Red-brown? That big thing, is the liver. That's where his anger is. That's why he's alive. That must be the kidneys... Nope, that's his balls. What do we do with the balls? We throw them away. Tar and feathers is an old recipe from the Wild West. The ingredients needed are… A barrel of tar! Yes! What else? A bag of feathers! Feathers and feathers and feathers! And of course, an individual who has angered - her fellow citizens. Me! - The tar - and feathers! Tar and feathers! - No! - You do that, I'll bite you! - Tar and feathers! - Get out of our village! - Never come back! Oh no! I don't want to, I don't want to... Enough! You are being punished! We don't want to see you anymore. I swear, I cross my heart. No! You always swear - but you keep being silly! - I don't want to go, please. We don't believe you anymore! - I'm sorry. - Never! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, I swear, I promise, I will be good. Look Mama they're so cute. It never fucking stops. That's not cute. That's his fault. It's a vicious cycle. And it goes on again, and again and again. It doesn't stop. You thought it was a free-for-all? Did you think you were welcome? And that it would be easy? Wrong. You don't even deserve to be eaten. You've enjoyed yourself! Are you laughing now? It's good, right? That's it! Is it funny now? Welcome! Fucking bloody rooster! Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out! Get out! Get out! What? Gabrielle. Are you OK? Ah, everything is just fine. - Will you spy on me forever? - Gabrielle, - if you're not well I can take the girls... - No. No, no, no. I'm an adult, you leave me alone. They cannot keep missing school all the time because social services will come. That's what you'll get. I'm very worried, to be honest. You don't want them to take - the girls, do you? - No, the girls are doing just fine. - Get lost! - Gabrielle? Please answer me! - Grandma? She bought a bow. - What? She's not well, you have to come. You all piss me off! Shut up! Why are you ratting mom out? You cannot tell! No! Elsa, stop! No! Give me back the phone. No, sweetheart. You're not going to start too? What kind of attitude is that? Why are you ratting me out? Do you have anything to say? Don't you have a good life? Are you unhappy? You are killing me right now. You're breaking me in half, what are you doing to me? Don't you think that sometimes I've had enough of you? Don't you think I've had enough of myself? So what do we say? What do we say? What do we say? Thanks? No. What do we say? Please? You're welcome? Sorry! Shut up, seagulls! Gotcha. I will try to get him to eat salt. He pecks. Breaking my balls this one... If I eat some I'll be a superhero like you. Yeah. If you eat three, though. Girls, bath time! School tomorrow. Here we go... Thank you very much. It's going to be OK. Do you eat them or not? If you eat them, you'll be a superhero. Even if you cry. To Elise, my salt sister. Subtitles: Mecal Subt
