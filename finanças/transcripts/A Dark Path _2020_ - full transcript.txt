Don't you dare. Don't you dare! I think... Lily, I think you need some water. Yes. Toilet? Thanks for that. You're welcome. Come on, onto the next one, it's only 9 o'clock! Lily, would you get in the back, please? Seeing as you asked so nicely. Yeah, mind the face, I need that. Sorry! Such a graceful creature. Like a gazelle. Giving birth. Seatbelt on, fuck shite! I'm cold, can we put the heating on? You're cold? Life begins at the end of your comfort zone, you know? So that's where I've been going wrong. Look at me, heading into the future. The unknown, marriage. Scary. I'm ready for it. Yeah, you look it. So glad you came. Lily said you'd probably be busy but. Well it was just a once in a lifetime moment, I just had to come, but now I'm feeling a bit... She's still not coming? Still not part of the bride tribe. What about FOMO? Not gonna miss out on much now, I mean we've already been at it how long? Not long enough! Come on! You kids have fun. Just get changed, otherwise you'll be missing out. On more puke? Yeah, I'm good thanks. Well, if you change your mind, give us a call. Yeah. Come on! Let's get going! Oh yeah. Married. Could marry now. Nah, it's all right. Not you. What are you lot doing? Molotov cocktail. Here, have some. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I think my eyes are bleeding from hay-fever. - Fuck! - Fuck! Try not to burn the whole place down. See, this is why we need you. I'd love to see you wrecked. No you wouldn't. It's not pretty. Lily, don't do anything I would, promise? Love you. Is she all right? Yeah, she can get proper savage sometimes though. Something in her brain just flips, so don't push it. You push it. Because I'm her little sis, and that's my job. Good night? I'm never drinking with your sister ever again. Please kill me. Cirrhosis will get you first, I think. Got to see another man's dick last night. Good for you, quite the achievement. It was quite big. It was, yeah. Thanks for comin'. Pleasure. I would but if you squeeze me, I might shit my pants. So classy, Claire. Fist? Love a bit of fisting. Fist bump. What time is your flight? 9 p.m. Tell me again why we have to get a shit o'clock flight? 'Cause you lot don't know any better. I hope I don't throw up in the bus. Or on the bus. On my lap. See ya later. Safe journey. Yep, yep. Where are you goin'? Get some coffees. Bit awkward really, it's like we've said goodbye but you're still there. Yeah, deal with it. Lily! I'm ready, I'm ready. My God, my head. Serves you right. It was worth it though. Was it though? Stop being a spoil sport. Did you have three burgers last night? Might have done. Think they all ended up on my top. Don't hate me. It was a bit tight anyway. You looked hot last night. Thanks. For a change. It's time to get a funk on, the others are long gone, so drink up. This smells like arse. What? What the fuck is this? It's all they had. Tastes like rimming. How the fuck would you know? Fuck. I hope I don't get charged for this mess. It's a hotel room, what are they gonna do? Yeah, well you can pay for it. Just fucking live a little. Just fucking clean up a little. Lighten up! I took one for the team. I wanted Jess to have a good hen do. Stop being a buzz kill. Yeah, well that was yesterday, and now they fucked off and left, so. So what? So little sister, we can get a move on. Hair of the dog, might help. Help? Dutch courage. No thanks. Did you even speak to anyone last night? Suzie a bit. Forgot about Suzie. What are you so afraid of? My friends don't bite, you know. There's fun in there somewhere. Let your hair down once in a while, release the boost once in a while. Yeah, because that went so well for me the last time that happened. Sorry. You know, I wish you just wouldn't bring it up once, just one fucking time. Just never seen you like that before. Yeah, well it's not pretty. Bet it's fun to watch though. Have you seen the state you're in? Boom. How the fuck are we even related? Come on, just go. Yes capitan. What the fuck? I'm not leaving these behind. , they don't give a shit. This stuff can clean drains. Wonderful. Pretty much how we found it. Can we get some proper coffee, please? Are you trying to annoy me? No, just comes naturally. Oh, smoking more? No. You know you'll get cancer and die. Everybody dies. Yeah. I'll fucking kill you if you don't hurry up. There she is. Hulk smash. Claire, come on. Door's open. Door's open. Door's open. Coffee? Get in the car. Coffee. Get in the car, we'll get. What are you doing? Prefer to feel like I'm being chauffeured. You're such a dick. Sister, you sound like our mother. Yeah, God forbid someone should parent you. I'm on fucking holiday. Drugs and alcohol. Why don't you ask your new friend to take your home? Too old for me. More your type. No actually, not uptight enough. I'm not uptight. Yeah, of course not. Ah! There she is. Might need a new kneecap. It's not funny. See this? This is you, then boom. What are you so afraid of? Having a little fun? Being yourself for a change? You suppress the real you for long enough, that shit is gonna give you a brain aneurism. These seeds right here, they're your seeds of greatness. Or destruction. Whatever. Don't suppress the seeds, Abby. Let them grow. Are you high? Sorry I don't always figure out into your selfish plans. I'm here, aren't I? Begrudgingly. You don't do anything anymore. That's not true. When was the last time you did anything interesting? You're exhausting. It was a mistake, sorry. You should be. I am. Definitely deserves me a coffee though, doesn't it? Love you. Yeah. What are you doing? Trying to load up the videos from last night. Thanks for helping. Any time. What's the sat nav say? Sat nav says no. Shit on my face. How did that happen? Maybe after you puked on me, we had to drive back from the bar last night. I see. Do not remember that one. Really? When you were crawling all over the place. That was a mistake. Didn't help though, did it? You think. Use your phone. I mean I would, but there's no fucking signal anywhere. Ah, fuck! It's just one straight road, from what I can remember. Well, get on that road then. I'm losing the battle for wifi here. Don't worry, Bear Grylls, mate. Love you, pumpkin tits. Love you, donut nips. Did you film some of this? Yeah, obviously, until you were sick on me. Ah, steady hand. So you did participate, sort of. Steady hands. Where's the night view? It's in the menu. The moon's a dead giveaway. Oh yeah. Oo. You look freaky. Tell us what's happening. I'm looking at a map, so we can get back to the airport, because someone broke our fucking sat nav, and there's no phone signal anywhere. Or maybe you're a cheapskate, and you've run out of data and credit. Tell me, why are we even here? Something about your friend Jess wanting a cheap hen do, like dirt cheap. Love you Jess. Or maybe your insistence on a rental car, instead of public transport. They're probably home by now. Yeah probably, assuming their plane didn't crash. Shit. Time to go. Are we going to make this flight? I hope so. Still no signal anywhere. What was that? Fuck. What? Flat tire. Is it fucked? Pretty fucked, yeah. Are we gonna miss the flight? I don't know, I just wanna get this sorted so we can get going. Does your phone have any signal? No. Shit. Fuck this country and it's shitty signal. Yeah. What? I just wanted to see if you needed any help at all. Not at the moment, thank you. You ever changed a tire before? No, you? Nope. Okay. Well that tire looks all right to me. Tires aren't supposed to hiss, dick brain. I'd rather not fuck my insurance. Maybe we could flag down another car. Yeah, well if you see one, let me know. Yeah. I'll point it this way. That'll do, that'll do. - That'll do. - Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. This is gonna need some Hulk. You're good with nuts. Yes, I've been told. Anymore? No, no, no, carry on. Yeah will do. There you go. You can hold the nuts. Oo! Okay. Oh fuck. What? The spare's fucking flat as well. I mean, I can put it on for now, but we can't drive it anywhere. Oh fuck off. Can't we pump it up? Yeah, have you got a spare pump on you? No. Yeah, well me neither. Don't get angry. I'm not. It's no one's fault. Yeah, it's just unfortunate. Is now a bad time to say that I'm desperate for a piss? Probably, yeah. We can't just sit here all night. We should go up the road for 10 minutes and see if we can find anything. Anything on the map? Nothing obvious, but it's better than just sitting here, we might find some phone signal. Yeah. Let's do it. You left the lights on. Don't worry, the turn themselves off. Is our car possessed? Yeah, just like. What if we don't find anything, or anyone? Ask yourself, what would our mother do? Or father. Find someway to blame me. Yeah, he would actually. Well, best to think positive in times like this. I think we might get raped. Or murdered. Or murdered then raped, then buried, then exhumed, then raped again. So much rape. Hear about stories all the time. Alien anal, probing. That is also a very distinct possibility. Yeah it is, and it's not something to joke about. Oo! Not to worry, I have the Hulk on my side. Stop calling me the fucking Hulk. Watch out. I think someone's going green. I think the point is never really know who you are, until you're put in a situation like this. High stress. Unpredictable. Possibly dangerous. Yep, and we all know you're someone that talks too much. Someone who lightens the mood, who laughs in the face of danger. Funny. It's not the vibe I'm getting. I'd rather keep talking actually. Anything to take my mind off this fucking scary road. Lily! Go, go on. Shit. There's nothing there. Well close it, they could be back any second. At least we're not the only car stuck, I mean if they've gone to get help then. Then what? I can't see anything. They could have been gone for hours, days even. Yeah, we'll never know. What is it? I don't know. Don't touch it. I wasn't gonna touch it. Poke it with a stick or something. You should be a scientist. Well? We should get back to the car. At least it's warm in there. Yeah. I'm fucking starving. Want some? No thanks. Oh my God. That good then? It tastes like Ebola. Oh it's fucking horrid. Wash it down with some of your Eastern European moonshine then. Will do. It has a fresh taste. Like communism. Yep. Nice. I really need a wee. I'll hold it. What now? I don't know. Do you think it was one of those spiky ball things that got in the tire? I don't know, maybe. Maybe those people went to go find somebody. Yeah, the car didn't look like it had been there long. Short of walking down a dark road in the middle of the night, I'm out of ideas. I'd rather not. I'll definitely miss the flight. I don't mind, as long as you're okay. Hey you. What? What? What? I wanna know. You wanna know what? What happened when you. Lost it. Was it scary? It was the most scared I've ever been. More than now? Yeah I'd say so. Did you just go bat shit? It didn't come out of nowhere. It was more than that. It was like being taken over by it, being possessed by it. I almost had no control. Almost, but the guy did provoke you. Guys, plural. Dorm room, drunk, class A, and you can guess the rest. They were grabbing at my friend Lynn. Things got a bit heated, bit out of hand. One of them grabbed me, and pinned me down. I couldn't breathe. And Lynn was asking them to stop, she kept saying "It's not funny anymore." And then one of them locked the door, and as soon as I heard that latch click, I just lost it. Shit. I kicked and screamed my way out, I've never been the same since. Never talked about it. Haven't seen Lynn, haven't seen the guys, just all gone. Just lucky you did what you did, when you did. I almost gave up. I didn't think I had the stomach for it. I just felt so powerless. But then Hulk smash. Exactly. Seeds of greatness right there. I mean, if I hadn't gotten myself into that situation, then I wouldn't have it etched in my memory, but I learnt a few things that night. My sister is a proper badass. Lily? Lily? Lily? Lily, where you at? Fine, be a dick. Lily? Shit. Lily? Hello? Lily? Hello? Lily? Lily? Keep talking, keep talking, I'm near. What happened to you? Please. Please help me. Please. It's okay. I'm here to help, okay? Do you speak English? Yeah. What's your name? Hannah. I'm Abby. Please, we need to go. Let me help you, please. Let me help you. Here you go. I have a sister, have you seen her? I just... I don't know, just be quick. How did this happen? Just please, just wrap it up, we need to go, then I'll explain everything, please. Tighter. Another. It's this way. It's even higher. Tell me what happened to you. Give me your phone. No signal. Hey! Where do you think you're going? No, no! You're not going anywhere until we find my sister. Please, it isn't safe. We have to go. We need to go! We need to go, we need to go. We need to go, we need to go. Hannah! What happened to you? Was it an animal? What did this to you? Hannah, I can't find my sister, and now I found you. I need your help. Are you alone? No. Peter. Who's Peter? Where's Peter? Back there. Could he be in trouble? Could my sister be there? Show me. Well? Peter opened the car door to get some air. He thought he heard crying. Crying? Yeah. And then he disappeared into the darkness, and all I heard next were his screams. I didn't run to help, I didn't know what to do. He kept shouting, I had to find him, but then I saw something. I didn't know what it was, I just turned and ran. I tripped, this is as far as I've come. Shit! One second. Help, somebody help us! Abby? Abby. Shh! How did you find us? What is that thing? I don't know, we just need to go. Keep tight to me, all right. Everything else. Where are we? In a cabin. Hannah, can you move Peter? He's badly injured. Please don't leave us in here. Help me. Help us. Hannah, do you have a belt? Yeah. Okay Peter, we're gonna need you to move yourself, okay? I can't carry you. None of us can carry you. I tried to blind it. The light hurts it. I know, I saw, you were really brave, but the light also gave away our position. I'm stupid. It was me who got us lost on that road. Peter, I don't care, let's just get out of here, please. Help me up. Use the wall. Lily, take my hand. Hannah, take Lily's. I'm gonna lead you out of here. Okay go. This way. It's coming back. Please, Peter! Just go, please. I can't, not this time, I'm sorry. Please stand up. We go together. Peter, we need to go now, okay? I can't, I can't. Any second that thing's gonna turn back around. And I'll be here to face it. No, no, no, no, no, no! Peter. Peter, get up! I'm sorry. Not this time, I'm sorry. Save yourself. Please, my love, please. I can't. Just go, please. I can't leave you again. Yes you can, okay? You can. You can get help. These people will help you, okay? Go with them. Be safe. I can't leave you. Yes you can, just go, just go! Go! Peter. Hide. Hannah, hide! Peter, no! Lily, don't look. It's coming. No, no, no, no! Abby! Listen to me, you're gonna run as fast as you can and not look back, okay? What about you? I promised I'd look after you, didn't I? Yeah, it's my fault we're here. It was my mistake. This isn't your fault, Abby. None of it is. If it wasn't for me, you'd be home already, be safe. You'd be on a different plane with your friends, not stuck out with your boring sister. If we do this together, we'll be okay. Molotov cocktail? I knew you were a loony. Ready? Yeah. Good. We'll make it quick. Hey! Hey! This way! Lily wait. This way! Okay go. Please work. Fuck, fuck. Try not to burn the whole place down. See, this is why we need you though. I'd love to see you wrecked. No you wouldn't. Lily, don't do anything I would, promise? Hey, hey. Come here. Come on you fuck. Come on, we have to move. I'm going as fast I can. Are you okay? Fine. What's that sound? We have to go. What's that sound? Now! Take these and go. What? Go! Where are you going? Go to the car, lock yourself inside and keep the lights off. Oh my God. Stop, stop, stop, stop. They put them there. What do we do now? No idea.
