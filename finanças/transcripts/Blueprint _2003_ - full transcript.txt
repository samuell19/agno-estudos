The near future Hey, stop! That racket is scaring the wapitis. How about "good morning"? Don't you like music? - Morning. - Morning. The early bird as usual. All finished. Did the generator valves arrive? The boat comes in 2 days. I don't feel like complaining. How much? 68.10. This is for you. - Bye. - Bye. Siri, come back. Iris. I'll try again: Good morning. My name's Greg Lukas. Hi. - Who's that? - We call her Wapiti, because she's so shy. She comes every few weeks to get her order. Always early, so she doesn't run into anyone. - She appears and disappears again. - Does she live out there? Near the Broken Islands. Her generator is busted. Siri, don't switch off. I know you don't wanna talk... - Where'd you get this number? - We can't go on like this. I don't have much time left. Please, come back to me. You are my life. Vancouver - 20 years earlier Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. - I'm glad you could come, Prof. Fischer. - Your invitation was an honor. You know how much I admire you? - For you. - Oh, thank you. I'd like to talk to you. Flowers don't really mean much to me, but I like these. Thank you. I have MS, multiple sclerosis. Would you have ever guessed? I'm very sorry. I love my work. I'm afraid that... You heard me play. I don't want it to suddenly end. That's why I wanted to see you. But I'm not a doctor. I work in reproductive medicine. What can I do - that hasn't been done? - Become the father of my daughter. Not the usual way. With the Fischer method. We are only allowed to use animals. I've read everything about you. I know you've been waiting for just this opportunity. We'll sign a pact. Mouse, sheep or human... Where's the difference? You're serious? - I'd be put on trial for that. - Not if we keep it secret. - There are still some risks involved... - Nothing is without risk. We can realize the future. You and me. The first to do it... forever. Read this, please. - What is it? - Our... our pact. This document clarifies our relationship in regard to our... ...to the child. My rights and your rights. For example, I obtain unlimited access to all the data I need to evaluate... Hold on! No 24-hour observation of my daughter. She's no guinea pig. The experiment is meaningless if I can't study her at every stage. Alright, but under one condition. You can only see her with my permission. - We also have to reach an agreement about my publication. - Exactly. You must keep quiet about how my child was conceived until I give you permission. No other way. No. No, I can't accept that. Listen, you have the right to see her. We'll decide together when the results will be published. This is your enucleated ovum... into which I am introducing your genetic code. The little black dot that looks like an eye contains all your DNA, your life's software, if you like. With everything that makes you special. We just have to wait until the cell divides. There's nothing to stop your pregnancy now. Congratulations. M? Ster Airport - Great to have you back. The reviews are fabulous. - Wonderful. We'll have to go through our schedule and maybe cancel a few concerts. Let's concentrate on the new record and the concert in Sydney. By the way, I need a nanny. Will you take care of that? You and a baby? You don't make decisions like that in passing. It wasn't made in passing. It was made very consciously. Who's the father? - We can put off finding a nanny, huh? - I never liked that term, "put off". I'd like to be alone. Drive home to your girlfriend, if you have one now. When would I ever have time for another woman? You are my life. It's absolutely certain that MS isn't hereditary. - Absolutely certain? - Absolutely. You know that. I get scared that something could be wrong. That's unnecessary. Everything's going according to plan. - Yes? - Hello, I'm Daniela Hausmann. I've come about the job as a nanny. You're the 9th applicant, but the first to be late. This is the child's room. - I hope it likes white. - It's a she. Her name is Siri. - Have you lived here long? - 8 years. I haven't had time to decorate every room, but that will change. - Do you like music? - Music? Yes... This room is a tabernacle. And this is the monstrance. It's a mortal sin to touch it. There's one thing you should know. I have multiple sclerosis, a disease of the nervous system. The phases come at irregular intervals and without warning. They're still infrequent but they'll increase. And in the end, I'll be deranged, paralyzed or blind. Or all three. You'd spend those years - with me and my daughter. Think you could handle that? - Yes. But MS can be treated. - Not all patients end up in a wheelchair. - I know. How do you know that? My grandfather had MS. When can you start? Anytime. Provided Janeck doesn't object. - Who's Janeck? - My son. He's three. Since his father left, we decide things together. More or less. - He misses his father. - Fathers aren't so important. Sixth month. Just received new results. Amniotic fluid, ultrasound... everything is absolutely fine. Not the slightest sign of any abnormality. The I.S. Pregnancy is perfectly normal. Evolution has led us to a frontier, not a barricade... And we are crossing it. The first ones, forever! Yes, press down again. - Fischer... - Congratulations, you're a father. How's the child? How are you? We're doing great. My God, we did it! The first one... the very first... - I have to see her. I'll take the next plane. - No, we need some time alone. I'm still taking the next plane. We have a contract, Martin. You can visit only with my permission. Don't wait too long. The first days are important to me. Give her a kiss from me. I will. We'll be getting a visitor from Canada soon. May I help you? I'm Professor Fischer. I'd like to see Ms. Sellin. - Sorry, she's on a trip. - A trip? Where to? - When will she be back? - I can't say, but she asked me to give you something. She said it wouldn't be worthwhile waiting. Thank you. Regards from Iris and Siri. Close your eyes. Sleep well, my life. - There you are. - What do you want? I heard you were having trouble with your generator. I've brought you the spare part. It arrived at noon today. I'll fit it for you, if you like. Okay. Thank you. - Why are you doing this? - I think it's good to help each other. Is that a piano? - Shall I help you put it together? - No. You want mushroom salad or veggie pie? Both. I've always had a weakness for hearty vegetarian dishes. - Are you looking for something? - A mirror. I don't have a mirror. Here, try this. How do I look? I don't like beards. - Are you a photographer? - Yeah. - You like animals? - Yeah. Especially wapitis. Where are you from? From here. But I live in Toronto. I work at an architect's office. My father had a sawmill around here. He died a few months ago. You don't need to tell me. I've looking for someone to buy the sawmill. You wouldn't be interested in buying an unprofitable sawmill? There's land to go with it. You could spend the whole day yelling at people who startle the wapitis. - You own the forest? - Just part of it. You fit in really well here. How long have you been living here alone? Well, I have to go. Flying after dark is forbidden. Thanks for dinner. It's your favorite? Rudolph. He was still small when I found him. I was a kind of substitute mother. Now he's two, and he doesn't know where he belongs. Who really knows? - What's your name? - Siri. Siri? Goodbye. Goodbye. Siri Sellin, hello. No, she isn't home. And I don't know when she'll be back. Want to talk to Daniela? Daniela... - I can't talk to you now, because Siri has to go to bed. - No! Oh yes, Siri has to go to bed! - Siri! - Hey, Mom. - Mom? - Hello... hey there, honey. How are you doing? - Fine. I've brought you something. For you. - I'm going downstairs now. Good night. - Good night. It's Rudolph. He'll keep you company when I'm no there with you. Rudolph. - Why can't you always be here with me? - Oh Siri. Come here. You know that your mommy is a famous pianist. Lots of people want to see her and listen to her. Art is a gift that must be shared. - Look, I made this for you. - Oh... - Is that us? - Hmm. You see how much we look alike? Like twins. Mommy twin! But your hair's a lot different. Because I color it. You'll look just like me when you're older. What about you? Will you be dead by then? - I don't want you to die, Mommy. I want you to stay with me. - But I'm not going to die. Not as long as you're alive. You are my life. Now get to bed. Bravo, Siri. - Would you leave us alone a moment? - Okay. Isn't she wonderful? Fantastic, perfect. If I think what she'll be like in a few years... Excuse me. I have lots to do for the concert in London. Thanks for the invitation. - Will I see you again? - I'm flying back today. I'll accompany you to the door. - What's wrong? Is it Fischer? - It isn't Fischer. It's Siri. Something's wrong. As your agent, I congratulate you, but as your friend... I don't know. What you've done to her is monstrous. Monstrous? How dare you! I mean, she is my daughter! Monstrous! Didn't you listen to her? - She's everything I hoped for. Even more, a miracle. - Like you. - What do you think? - Every time I see Siri... I believed it would work, but that she's so perfect... And she's perfectly healthy. The experiment is a total success. Iris, we can't keep this secret anymore. Do you want to go to prison? What we did is illegal. - Things change. And if science needs a martyr, then... - No! We didn't mention "martyrs" in our contract. It's too soon! No one should know. Siri above all. Why don't we have papas? I have one, but - He's gone. - Where is he? I don't know. - I've never seen him before. - Don't you miss him? When I'm a famous pianist like Mom I'll find him and tell him to come back to you. Why should he listen to you? Because I'll be famous... and monstrous. Monstrous! Monstrous! I'm monstrous, too. I'm the hunchback of Notre Dame. I'll show you my secret wishing-tower. Don't be afraid... Here... look... This is the place of wishes. If you want something really badly, write a note and hide it here. And when the sun shines on it, your wishes shoot up into the sky at mega-light-speed. Wanna try it out? Here. I want to become a famous pianist and play a concert with Mommy. How stupid! - Will my wish come true? - Sure thing. But sometimes it takes a while. The hunchback says so! Don't leave my tower. Dummy! What about your hands? Can you move them? - Huh? - It was my fault, Ms. Sellin. You're so stupid! You'll never play together again! Use your head! What if you'd broken your arm or leg? Come on... And where were you? She slapped me. So... You can burn off your excess energy here instead of fooling around with Janeck! Your very first grand piano. When I got my first grand piano, I was much older than you. I didn't want to give it to you until your birthday... Look at it. Isn't it beautiful? Play. Very good. Ms. Sellin is very sick, Janeck. You can't tell, because the illness lurks like a predator waiting to strike. So she gets scared and nervous, and she doesn't know what she's doing. But you did the right thing. Honesty is always best. I'm sorry, Janeck. I should not have hit you. It is inexcusable. Mommy, what's wrong? I'm afraid, Mommy. Don't worry. I'll be fine. - You are my life. - I am your life. Good evening. Ms. Sellin... I'm a doctor. - Are you allergic to anything? - Bad reviews. I have multiple sclerosis. Give me some cortisone. - Enough of that! - Hey! Tom, how much of the North America tour is planned? - And when are we in Vancouver? - There's a chance in 3 months, but that's too soon after your breakdown... Iris, - Give yourself more time. - Time is what I don't have. Anyway, I feel great now. Don't be so wild! Daniela! Speaking of Vancouver, - Fischer tried to reach you. - Fix the Vancouver concert in 3 months, and then I'll meet him for dinner. Wait a second. Come here. What if we fly to Vancouver together? Do I have to? I'd rather stay here. It'll be a nice concert. And we'll meet Professor Fischer who you liked. I'd rather stay here. Can I go on playing? Okay. I'll call back later, Tom. Martin, sorry to keep you waiting. The audience wouldn't let me go. I wanted to bring Siri, but it didn't work out. It was her decision, not mine. I really wanted her with me. An apertif for the lady? Yes, I'll have a champagne. Thank you. Nice to see you. Iris, I can't wait any longer. Scientists the world over are doing similar... experiments. But still nobody knows that we succeeded long ago. I see. You don't want others to get the credit for your work. That's not the point. By publishing, I can challenge the ban on cloning. We can no longer keep secret what we succeeded in doing long ago. If you do that, I'll cut off the flow of information immediately. We have a contract. The time spent with Siri before she finds out is precious for her and me. If you go public now, everything will change at once. What would you do if you were me? - In a sense, you're her father. - Yes. Do you love me, Martin? If you wanted to make me feel like a good lover... you've succeeded. Or maybe you wanted to make up for Siri's conception. You are a good lover, although you're a brilliant scientist. Please, help me protect Siri for a while, okay? She's so defenseless. For a while. Sorry you weren't home. Tel: 2507283183. P.S. I don't like it either. Please... Hello, Greg Lukas here, but I'm not in at the moment. Please leave a message after the tone. Thank you. Hello, Greg Lukas. This is Siri... Thanks for the flowers. You can stop by for a coffee tomorrow if you like. Siri, this is Daniela. I wouldn't call if it weren't urgent, but we just took her to the hospital. She's in a really bad way. She needs you now. You have to forgive her. Remember everything she did for you, not only for herself... for you. Out of love. For Siri. Piano Concerto No. 1 It's your day, Siri. Could you turn it up, please? It's the first piano concerto composed by Iris Sellin, the world-famous pianist. It is dedicated to Siri, her 13 year-old daughter. Experts claim she is an equally exceptional talent, like her mother. We look forward to her first concert. But tonight it's her mother's turn with a world premiere. Just a few more minutes... I haven't been this nervous in 20 years, Tom. They loved you then, and they'll love you tonight. I'm going out now. Wait for me afterwards. The doors are shut. Why are you here? - You invited me. - But not backstage. I wanted to see you. Stop it! I'm on stage in 30 seconds. What about afterwards? You can't just show up whenever you like. No encores tonight. Neither on stage nor in bed. Go, now! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Martin Fischer, professor and director of the Center of Life Science. I've invited you here to announce something very important. What you are witnessing here is the conception of Siri Sellin, the daughter of the pianist and composer Iris Sellin. Siri is the perfect replica of her mother. She resembles her father in no way, because she has no father. Siri Sellin is a clone. The world's first cloned human. - There she is! - Siri!
