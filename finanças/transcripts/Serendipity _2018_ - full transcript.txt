I'm going to choose the middle table tonight. I think it's my lucky spot. - Hello, Sir! - Hello. - Gonna play for a while. - Good luck! Okay, see you! You really bring luck. What did I say? Luck! Happy birthday, dear papa. Happy birthday to you. You're going to live, Dad. Doctor! Wake up! Don't leave us alone! Wake up! By the way, did you know there's an assignment for today? An assignment? You always forget. What is on your mind? Besides me? You're annoying. - Am I wrong? - Yes! Think about it. If you didn't meet me, you would have dropped out. And then you would have never met me. Right? Right? Don't forget your homework is from page 17 to 27. Due tomorrow. That's too much! And all of them are hard. Here. Right here. This guy. He is a math genius. You just need to ask him to teach you. What oooh? That's enough for today. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Sir. Are you proud having a math genius as a boyfriend? I didn't know you like drawing. Once... I was bullied because of that drawing. They said... I don't understand a thing about sci-fi. That's why you're the only one who knows about this. My dad wanted to create a sci-fi movie. He said he had had enough directing for advertisements. So all this time, the person who made you like Star Wars was your dad? Maybe... He was able to look into the future. That later... There will be a guy who falls in love with me... ...because I am a fan of Han Solo. Oh, right! My father used to say... What is it? Adapt a classical myth and turn it into sci-fi. For example... Let's say they are Pandawa. This one is Bima, this is Korawa. And then the other one... - This. - Stop, stop, stop. I think I know what I need to do now. Ran. Thank you. You've given life into my fantasy. What's my reward? You want one? Of course. Okay. Wait here. Okay. How did you know I like-- Ready? One. Two. Three! Ran. We've been dating for 6 months. When are you going to tell the truth to your mom about us? What if she disapproves? And we're not allowed to date? I'm not even allowed to know where you live. Every time I drop you off here, I get worried. Can you please... ...be patient for me? - Bye! - Bye. Be careful, Ran. Mom? Arkan... Why are you home so late? What's wrong, Mom? Nothing, I'm fine. I'm fine. Mom, please. What's wrong? Later... When the time is right... I will let you know. But for now, I have a task for you. Auntie Linda is in Bandung. Can you pick her up at the hotel? Yes, Mom. I'm here at the lobby. I'll wait downstairs. Good evening, Sir. Sorry Sir, this is members only. But Sir, my girlfriend is inside. You should wait at the lobby. Please, Sir, just a minute. I have to get in. Who is it? Been bothering us for a while. Just a friend. I'll turn it off. He thinks I'm stupid and he just had to yell at me. When in fact the cards were bad. That's why I had to punch him. Beggars will stay being beggars. Where are you? I'll be at Vanda park. Sorry! I fell asleep. I think I was too tired after our day out. Tired? Fine. Fine. Then... Who is the girl in this photo? Were you sleepwalking at the hotel? Ar... - I can explain... - Explain what? About not letting me visit your place... ...because your mom would rather have you date an old man... ...who has a lot more money than I do? Is that so? Ar... - I don't know where to begin... - Then don't! What I've just seen... ...is enough to explain who you really are. Ran. Why are you crying? Look at me. Look at me! You want to play victim? I'm the victim here. Not you! Okay. No, no, no. This is not your fault. This is my fault. It's my fault for being stupid and believing whatever it is we've been through all this time. You and I... ...are over now. Ar, please listen to me! I can explain everything, just give me time! Ar! I'm forced to do this! Please listen to me! Did you guys fight? What's wrong? - Ranti. - It's Rani, idiot. How much for a night? What did you just say? Ran, if you'd go out with an old man, why not go out with us? Don't be cocky. We all know about it. Ran, take it easy. Rani! I know I was wrong. But did you really have to ruin my life? What are you talking about? I'm not following. You have no remorse at all for spreading the photo? Damn, they're all mad! This is crazy. Ran, you have to speak up. Tell them that it's not you in the photo! Ran. Am I right? It's not you, is it? I don't want to talk about it. Ran. I know you're sad. But I just want to know one thing. Please answer me. It's not you in the photo, is it? Hello? Ran? Is it really that important? Of course it is! Why so? It's important because I'm your... I've been bothering you. I'm sorry. Bye. Good morning. Good morning, Sir! We have a new student today. Introduce yourself. - Hello, guys. My name is... - Gibran! That's embarrassing. So you've been watching my channel? That means... - How do I greet my viewers? - Hey guys! Look Sir, they said hey guys. I've been teaching here for years and that is the tackiest introduction ever. Enough. Go and have a seat, next to Rani. - Over there? - Yes, next to Rani. Hey, what's up? What's up? Hey, what's up? Open page 216. Hello? A new chapter. Are you out of your mind? What? Don't beat around the bush and just be straightforward! Do you still have a relationship with that person? Who do you think you are? You come here and try to meddle with my marriage. Salim, you married my sister! - I have the right to... - This is our problem! Our problem! And I don't need to answer all your questions! Salim! I'm not finished talking. Salim! That bastard. Hello? Arkan? Did you follow your dad? - I have to teach him a lesson. I... - Don't. Don't. Just come home. Mom, I can't leave you like this. - I have to... - Come home, sweetie. Come home, okay? Mom. - I... - If you truly love me... You should come home. I beg you. Come home. Bastard! What's up? Lack of smile... ...is a sign of dehydration. Not funny. Chillax, girl. - I was joking. - I don't need jokes. Get it? But I got iced tea! Sorry! Let it go, she's always like that. Well, it was my fault. If I could, I would follow her home until she forgives me. You don't have to go that far, Gibran. She acts like that not only towards you, but to everybody. That makes me even more curious. How could someone not smile at anyone? Alright gotta go. - Bye. - Drive safe. Rani. - What are you doing, Mom? - Stop! So you're stealing now? Mom. Dad got that watch for you. I picked it for your birthday. I don't want to see you hanging out with Mr. Salim using a watch dad gave you. Rani, you don't need to talk about the past. Your dad is not here anymore. That doesn't mean you can treat him like this! Treat him like this? Like this, you say? I took care of him for three years in the hospital. I slept every night on the floor. I lied every day to your father, saying that we're okay. When in fact, debt collectors come to our house every day, yelling at me. You think living like that... It doesn't give you the excuse to live like a whore! - Rani. - Hit me! Hit me again! Dad is not here anymore. I'm no longer of value to you. It's not like that. Just ruin my life while you're at it. I don't have anyone else. Rani. Rani, wait. Rani! Rani! I need to talk to you. Rani. No need to. I don't know you anymore. Ran. Hi. What are you doing here? I don't know how much of a mess your life may be... But if you ever need a friend... I can do that. Hello? Hi. Sorry for bothering you. Are you busy? What's up? Is it about this afternoon? You don't have to worry. Your secret... ...is safe with me. Okay? You can read minds? Yep, I'm half-mutant and half-human. I'm the coolest mind reader on earth. You take some time to warm up. Meaning? We've known each other for a week. We sit next to each other. And you're laughing just now? That's a bit rude. Alright, sorry. I've been rude to you. I'm sorry. By the way... Thanks. For earlier. Ran, anytime. If you need to talk, just tell me. I'm your friend. Okay? Thank you. Yeah. Rani. I want to apologize. I know you've been wanting these shoes. Okay. I gotta go. Oh look. Are those shoes real or fake? Must be fake, right? It's real. It's also easy to get it. As long as you're willing to sell yourself. Oops. What did you just say? Ran. Acting all cocky just because you've got new kicks? I bet you sold yourself for it. Watch your mouth. You need to watch yourself. So desperate to look cool that you're being a whore for it. How dare you! Rani! Loli! Ma'am. - Loli was... - Rani hit Loli first, Ma'am. And then Loli got angry. And, well. That happened. Did you really hit her first? I asked you a question. Did you really hit her first, Rani? I did. - But... - My office, now. Everybody, go back to your classes! Rani, come with me. Alright, now you should put the books inside and sort them according to the category. What's up! Hey hey hey! I'm holding iced tea. Let's sit down, so we can look chill. - Gib, Gib. - What? I'm not finished yet. I'll help you with it. Let's go. Gib. Don't worry about it. There. Have a seat. If your stomach is empty... ...you won't be able to smile. Is my smile that important? Of course it is! Because a smile is a curve that can straighten a lot of things. Alright, eat up. Dig in. Where are the lyrics? - Just du du du du? - Yeah. For now, it's du du du du. I've had this song for three years. But I can't seem to find the right lyrics. But the melody stuck with me, so. Well, why not? Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? Repeat what you just did. Okay. What are you doing? Let me see. Wow. This is good. Sing it. Gib, my voice is very flat. It's not pretty at all, so you should sing. You wrote the lyrics, so you have to be responsible for it. Please? Just once. Okay? Just once. One, two, three, four. I want to blame time Who made me meet him Leaving a trail of pain that lasts for nights Even though it was sweet Before I felt defeat In my heart, I always ask Does he still remember me? When he is alone Or when he is in the warm embrace of his lover Is my name still written in his heart? Or is everything erased from his mind? The heartbeat is getting stronger, muffled by lips shut tight It plays bitter notes that tires the heart The sun is now black, as dark as the pain I swallow In my heart, I always ask Does he still remember me? When he is alone Or when he is in the warm embrace of his lover Is my name still written in his heart? Or is everything erased from his mind? Sorry. It's fine, I understand. So sorry. This is embarrassing. Uh-huh. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Ma'am! Mr. Wagino can't come in today. There's an assignment for you. Prepare a piece of paper for a quiz. It's about the chapter last week. Limits. I'm doomed. I thought it was for tomorrow! Don't worry. I studied. Really? I'm counting on you. For now, I'm going to change your seating. Okay, Loli switch places with Bobby. Arkan, switch with Desi. Gibran, you can take Tora's place. Tora, go to Neni's place. Neni, go to Gibran's seat. Anggia you can switch with Debby. Okay, let's start. Gib! Let's switch places. I'll feature you in my vlog. Ten more minutes. Make it quick. You don't have much time. What is your problem? Are you messing with me? Stay put, new kid. Whose fault is this? - Mine. - Mine. Which one of you caused a ruckus when changing seats? - Him. - Him. Don't make me confused. Which one of you made this note for Rani? Gibran. You wrote this for Rani, right? Yes, Ma'am. Right. But why are Rani's results exactly the same with Arkan's? That's true. See? I'm right? If you're right then what? Then you're all punished! - What? Why? - I know? The point is... This place is the most hated place... ...but people still want to keep it. Sounds familiar. There is this one guy... He hates this one girl. He hates her gut. He thinks very low of her. But he doesn't want to see this girl be with another guy. I wonder who? Hey. Hey! What? You're being rude. Let's finish this. Okay. I'm not afraid. I thought you were. Why should I be afraid? Okay. You've never seen my moves, have you? Have you seen Muhammad Ali? Have you seen Michael Jackson? What is going on? You're still fighting even after being asked to clean the restrooms? What are you trying to be? A boxer? Or members of a campaign party? Arkan, move to the other restroom and help Rani. Now. Yes Ma'am. Let me do this. I'll take care of it. It's dirty. You must be tired. Just wait over there. What's up with you today? Why are we here? Answer me. So I can stop asking you. Do you want me to forget you or not? Ra. I know I was wrong... What's up! Hey. Why do you look so sad? You're prettier when you smile. Smile! Mrs. Ida got some tea for us. Let's go and drink for a while. Okay? Let's go. Gib. Gib. Gib! Where are we going? Shouldn't you make a turn there? We're going somewhere that can make you smile again. Remember. A smile... ...is a curve that can straighten anything. Look, Ran. We're almost there. Ran? What's wrong? What is it? Oh, your battery died? Don't worry. I have a powerbank. Where is it... Here it is. Here you go. It should turn on in a while don't worry, Let's go. Come on. Careful. Ran. Okay. Ran, I took you here... ...to see the sunset. Not the sky. We could do this on the rooftop of my house. I'm just in this kind of mood. Why, because of what happened earlier? Sunsets are beautiful. But it appears just for a short period. Meanwhile, the sky... ...is always there for us. Even though it could be sunny... Sometimes cloudy... Sometimes dark. And sometimes it just gets way too hot. But we can never not see the sky. The sky is real... I like you. I want us to be more than friends. What do you think? Ran. I know... Why you can't answer. Let me take that back. I know... Who is the reason behind you not answering my question. Ran? Rani. Please look at me. Give me time. To prove that I'm better than Arkan. Gib. - I don't know... - Ran. I'm not a sunset. I'm not the sky either. That's interesting to you. But I promise, I will always be there for you. I hope so. Hello, Dad! I'm at home now. Hang on a sec, Dad. Dad, my phone is dying, I'll call you back. Okay, Dad. Idiot! Idiot, idiot, idiot. Where were you? You didn't answer my calls. I'm sorry. I left my phone with my friend. Ran. I've seen everything. I now know why Arkan left you. I understand. If you choose to leave me too. Ran. Explain everything to me. So I have a reason to leave. Or to stay with you. There's only two meetings left. - You had the audacity to... - That was my fault. I panicked. I didn't want this house to be seized. That's why I barged in when you were gambling. That's what I was going to talk about. My spiritual teacher said... ...that your daughter brings luck. She brings luck! Why don't we settle the house payment using another way? Listen. You... ...just need to accompany me every time I gamble. I'll pay you every time you come, just like if you were working. Half is for you. The other half... ...is to pay back your father's debt. I just have to accompany you? Nothing else, right? The sexiest thing in this world for me... ...is playing cards. And money. Not women. Rani. People will talk about you. Take this deal... ...or I won't give you any other chances. Mr. Andre, please don't drag my daughter into this... I'll take it. How often should I go with you? So I've never really done anything else. Other than accompanying that man who really believes in those things. All of this... He lent it to me. So that I won't look embarrassing every time I go with him. Your father's debt... How much is left? There's still 200 million left. I still have to do this for a long time. Does it really have to be like this? Is there any other way? If there was another way... You won't be seeing me like this, Gib. Ran, you gotta try. When people have problems they always try to find different ways. If I have a problem I would... I'll find a way and... If I can do it, you can too. How long are you going to keep doing this? Don't compare my life to yours. I'm different. I didn't choose this kind of life. You don't know how hard it is to be me. Sorry. I'm tired with my life. I said I'm sorry. Are you angry? It's getting late. I should go home. Gib. Please answer me. Are you upset? Get some rest. Are you seriously coming in here dressed like that? I'm giving this back. I quit. No. I'll give you 10 minutes. Dress up. I'll wait. Sir, I really... Haven't I been nice enough to your family? You can still live in a house of your own. And I have never done anything bad to you. Have some decency as a person. So this is the guy? Gib? What are you doing here? Are you looking for trouble? What is this? Two hundred million, right? You can start counting. Starting today... Rani's debts are paid. Gib! Don't worry, it's clean money. I don't have any business with you. I do, with Rani. And... Her debts are paid so you should leave her alone. Have some decency as a person. Gib. Where did you get all that money? I sold all the stuff in my studio. But I can save up to get those back. However. I can't postpone... ...saving your life. I don't know how to pay you back. By living your life. That's good enough. Uncle! Gibran! It's been a while. How are you? - I'm fine. - Who's this? - It's Rani, the one I've been telling you about. - Oh, have a seat. - What did you order? Tea? - Tea. - So this is Rani? - Yes. Okay, Rani. Gibran here, my most handsome nephew, has told me about you. This restaurant is always crowded, it's full of customers. We need more people. We have an opening... There's a position which fits the schedule for a student like you. However... You have to work very hard here. Okay? Why? Because I'm pretty strict. As a restaurant owner, I'm strict. Even the mayor of Bandung is afraid of me. How's that? Do you want to work here? It's all up to you. Yes. I'd love to. If so, you can come in tomorrow. So you start tomorrow, and this is my assistant's card. You should contact my assistant as soon as possible and all your stuff will be taken care of tomorrow. Okay? - Okay. - I'm a nice person, right? - You are. - Nice and successful. - Alright gotta go. - Okay, Uncle. - Thank you! - Keep it up. - All set? - All set! - Thank you, Gib. - Yeah. Afternoon, Ma'am. Are you the homeroom teacher of this girl? Is this Rani? Whore! Ran. Ran, hey. Move away, Gib! Gosh. I never knew you could be this evil. Evil? Ar, we both know what she is like when she's not in school, right? That doesn't mean you can take footage from my phone and spread it to everyone. Alright, I was wrong about the photo. But everyone needs to know, right? Do you want our school... Everyone? You said everyone? Listen. You can stop being a social justice warrior. I know this is not for everyone. This is about you. You and your ego. And I know for sure. Because you were the first to share that video in the chatroom. Why? Why did you do all of this? Because you're jealous? Because I choose Rani over you? I hate you. Rani? The headmaster is waiting for you. Rani. I'm sorry I can't do much. I actually oppose this treatment for you. I know I've given you a lot of punishments, but that doesn't mean that I hate you. If you have any problems, don't hesitate to contact me. Okay? Good morning. Good morning, Ma'am. I want to apologize. If I ever did something bad to you. Even though I don't know what I did wrong. I'm not a whore. But I'm sure... All of you believe what you see in the video, and not my own words. I don't know why... And who... ...spread those photos and videos. I hope this kind of thing only happens to me. Just me who gets to be alienated. Hated. And having no one to turn to in this school. Ma'am! What happened to Rani? She got dropped out because of the video. Yes? Hello. I used to be very close with Rani. But since that photo came out, I... Did you know the truth behind it? That's why I came here. Perhaps there's something that you know better than me. Everything I know about Rani... ...I have recorded. It's all in here. But... I don't know if I should upload it or not. Here. I really miss Rani. Let's go visit her. You know where she lives? Of course. - Cool. - Come on! Hey, wait up! Hello? Ran! I've missed you so much! I'm so sorry. You never told me anything! I've missed you too. I... I want to apologize. All this time... I've been causing problems for you. How did you... ...know that I work here? Jenn. - Are you... - You... You go first. I just wanted to say... ...that... What are you doing here? Trying to ruin her life a second time? I've never ruined anyone's life. - Gib. - Ran. Loli told me. The photo that was shared was from his phone. His phone! First of all, you're making no sense. You know nothing about that photo. Second... I have nothing to do with you. Gib! Whoever hurts Rani has to go through me. Gib! Gib! Gib, enough! I don't want to see you again. Ran. - Ran, okay... - Please. Don't go looking for me. Ran! I'm sorry, I couldn't hold back! Ran! Ran. I was wrong. I couldn't control my anger. I was brutal, arrogant, reckless. Anything bad that you want to say to me... I apologize. And... You've been behaving badly. Ever since you became friends with that snob. Black. Let go of me! Let go! - Shut up! - Let go! Arkan! Ar. Arkan. Arkan wake up! Ar, wake up. Arkan! Arkan! Arkan! - Let us handle this for now. - Arkan! Arkan! Arkan! Arkan... I love you, Ar. Please get well soon. Arkan... Are you the one who called? Thank you. I'll be outside, Ma'am. Rani! Rani. Are you okay? You're alright? How did you know I'm here? Gibran. Your friend, he dropped by our house. Rani. You don't have to be afraid. We've decided to not continue this relationship. It's for you. And Arkan. And for my wife. We've had our rough days. But we have the chance to repair all of this. Don't ever hate your mother. It was all my fault. I apologize. Salim and I... ...used to date for a while. But... He had to marry Arkan's mother. And... Your grandparents asked me to marry your father. I'm so sorry, Rani. I've hurt you, for so long. Mom. It's okay. Just forget about it. I love you. - Good afternoon, Sir. - Yes? We're the police. Do you mind coming with us? Two weeks later Gib. I need to talk to you. I'm sorry. I posted your video without your permission. But I fully agree with you. I'm also one of the people who caused trouble to Rani. I need to use my account. So that a person who acted so foolishly like me... ...can be seen supporting you. So... What happens after this? I have a plan. To help Rani get back to school. Okay. Guys. Guys! Hello. Okay. I don't need to explain much. Those of you who have watched the video on Arkan's Facebook should know. But I... I just want to remind you that what happened to Rani... ...can happen to all of us. Gibran, what do you mean? Not all of us are prostitutes like Rani. I mean... We can all become victims of the injustice in school. This school that prioritizes their image instead of... ...what their students are going through. They don't know. Which is exactly like what's on your rotten mind. All you can do is blame, and think of the oh-so-pure image you have in your mind. Guys. We've all treated Rani wrongly. But if we don't fix this stupidity... Aside from Rani, me, you, you, you and you. Anyone can get kicked out of this school. That's true. Without them knowing if it's right or wrong. So now I'm gonna protest. Those of you who have the guts to join me, let's shout. - What's up? - What's up! What the hell is up? What are you all doing? Sir. We're doing a protest. Protest? - Yes. - A protest? Yes, Sir! Count me in! He's with us! For those of you who believe we are a family... Who care about the welfare of fellow students... Let's protest the injustice of this school! To the field! Ma'am, are you with us? - Yes. - You are? Let's go! Once more! For those of you who care about Rani... Let's come to the field and protest, demand for justice! What happened to Rani can still happen to us all. Because this school... ...chooses image over justice. Therefore. I, we... ...would like to ask the headmaster for justice! Save Rani! Justice for Rani! Save Rani! Save Rani! Save Rani! Save Rani! Ladies and gentlemen, just so you know, if I didn't make the decision... ...our school will be viewed as having no morals. That means your children will be viewed the same way. On behalf of the committee, I am disappointed with your reasonings, Ma'am. Surely the image of this school must be upheld. That is a must. But it should be based on justice. I've been listening to Mr. Wagino and Mrs. Ida. - But it seems you didn't give a chance for a dialog... - Correction, Sir. I had a dialog with her, Sir. It wasn't a dialog, Ma'am. You made a decision without bothering to find out what actually happened. That is not a dialog, Ma'am. Ma'am. Rani was dropped out of this school because of a video. Did you also punish the person who spread the video? Well, Ma'am. I am a lawyer. I will give you some time to reevaluate this case. If within a week you cannot come up with a valid reason for us... ...on behalf of the committee... ...I will take this to the court. Afternoon, Ma'am? Mom! Mom? Mom! - Rani? - Mom! - What's wrong? - Mrs. Ida called. I can go back to school! - What's up? - What's up! Hi! - Hi, Ar. - How are you? Why didn't you come for the protest? Hey, he's the one behind it all! - They said it was fun yesterday? - Yeah! No, no, no. For me, the best part was when Loli got caught. And now she's suspended! That one girl is really something. I swear. Oh well. The good thing is that we've found the culprit. Rani! - Hi! - Hi, Ran. Hey. If you still like her... Sit next to her. If not, I will. And until she becomes my girlfriend... I won't give up. What's up. Sup. Hi. Princess Leia. Hi. Han Solo. Miss me? Serendipity. According to Webster Dictionary... It means an unexpected happiness. This hot mess unexpectedly reunited Rani with her mom... Arkan and his dad... Rani and Arkan... Me and... Well, no one. Even though I was just passing by and I tasted the bitterness... Well, I won't say even though. It tastes like shit. Bitter. So? Are you satisfied knowing all the truth? How do you feel? Happy? Sad? Somewhere in the middle? I hate being in the same class as you jerks. Assholes.
