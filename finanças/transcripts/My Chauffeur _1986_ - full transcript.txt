Our job is to hold the line. The philistines are at the door. The yahoos are at the window. They shall not pass. I'm sorry I'm late! Oh, oh, oh I'm sorry! What are you doing? I came for a job. This is Brentwood Limousine Limited. I know, I'm gonna be a driver. Madam, if you continue masturbating my driver, you are going to be a murderer. What do you want? Job. - Doing what? - Driving. Driving what? Big black limousines, woo baby! Goodbye. What do you mean, goodbye? I mean get out. Mr. Witherspoon hired me. Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. You're deluded. I've never had a lude in my life! Get me security. My name is Casey Meadows. Mr. Casey Meadows? No. It says your name. Yes. - You're female. - Yes I am. And you say that Mr. Witherspoon hired you as a driver for us? - Bingo! - When? - Yesterday. - How? This dude. What dude? I don't know, never saw him. There was this guy in a monkey suit left a note where I used to work. I just quit. Said to be here at 8:30. That's why I'm a little late because I had a little party and my dog got into some of the drinks. He had some beer and bourbon and scotch and this morning woke up, he was so sick. He had one of those hangovers you can't keep anything down, you just throw up and you throw up and you throw up so I tried to give him an Alka-Seltzer. That's why I'm a little late. Have you ever tried to give a dog an Alka-Seltzer? I put it on his tongue and I held his mouth closed. Foamed over the side. So I think it burned his tongue 3 little bit because he started barking and he tried to bite me and that's real unusual for Mr. Boomerang. Shut up! Huh? Mr. Witherspoon did not hire you. Yes he did. - He did not. - Did too. Did not. Call him up. I'm going to, thank you. Yes, Mr. Witherspoon. McBride here. Good morning sir. I have a young woman with us, Miss Meadows. She maintains that you hired her as a driver. She is a female. Very well sir. Yes, we'll put her through the trial period. Thank... It will be a very unpleasant trial period, and a short one. - Giles. - Yes sir? Get her a uniform. Hey, slow down. What's your problem? Where are you going, babe? It is babe, isn't it? A bloody female! Never thought I'd live to see the day. Jesus Mary and Joseph, will you give it a rest? She'll be the death of us yet. - You are not going to die. - Dead already. Ain't no place for a woman. I don't believe it, you above all people. I should have thought you'd against this type of segregation. Ain't segregation. What do you call it then? Nature. It's not the driving. Oh really, what is it then? White women. The what? Woman such as that don't have to work 'cause she never had to work. All she got to do is wiggle her butt and she can get anything she wants. Lord deliver me! Dropped your cards. These are men's clothes. It's a man's job. Fine. You're welcome to watch. A woman is a horrible goddamn thing to have around. That's the truth. How would you know? I've been married five times. Then you never kept a woman around long enough to find out, did you? There'll be hair curlers all over the place! Panties in the sink. Brassieres hanging on the lamps. There'“ be a goddamn douche bag “m the showed! Kiss me, stupid. Do you think the little bimbo can drive a car? Damnit men, what are you all so hot and bothered about? Afraid she'll open her jacket and flash her titties at you? You couldn't handle that, could you? I seen enough titties in my time. I haven't. Been 100 years since I seen a good titty. No such thing as a bad titty. God damnit! There now, that's my point. The little bimbo hasn't been here an hour and all you hormone graveyards can talk about is nipples! Didn't mention nipples. We were speaking of the titty as a whole. Oh shut up. Well now, looks as if the little girl is gonna put some life back in you old dinosaurs yet. If she can drive. Can you drive? I can drive anything but what you call it, stick shift. You can't drive a standard? Then you don't have a chauffer's license. - Oh yes I do. - How? - Wimoweh. - What? I used to work at Camp Wimoweh and all the counselors there used to have class two licenses. You used to be a school bus driver and now you want to drive limousines? Woo baby! Memorize this. If you can read. What is this? Dawson, better get a move on. Gotta be at the Hyatt by 10. Yes sir I think our little girl is gonna fit in just fine. - Stop! - No! - Come back here! - Why? - What'd you give me that thing for? - Those are the rules. - They're stupid. - You don't like them? - Quit. - You quit! I've been with mean old assholes like you all my life. Well you certainly talk like a lady. I'm not a lady. I can see that. You like making people look up to you, don't you? I don't make the rules around here. You don't make them but you love them! You go by the book or get out. Fine, I'm gone! What's the trouble, dear heart? Don't touch me! She's too good for us. I came here to drive, not kiss ass. Kiss... Ah yes. Henry, I left the boys deserted in there. Would you go and sit in for me? Now, Henry. Thank you, you're most gracious. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. You look like a cat's tail. Listen. Would you consider taking a little stroll with me? There's something I'd like you to see. I don't suck up to people! I don't care what that book says. Oh I agree. I drive, they can open up their own goddamn doors! I hear you. I don't say sir to anybody. I understand dear heart, really I do. Now will you take that little walk with me? There's something I'd like you to see. What is it? She's a rare and beautiful work of art, is she not? What's she cost? Ah, the money is not important, child. This your car? Mr. Witherspoon set me up with her 20 years ago. Go ahead, touch her. You can feel it in your fingertips, can you not? Take a look at that grill. One man alone with his own hands made that. I met him once. Real artist. The whole car is a rolling work of art. Just to sit in her makes you a better person and that's our real job, child. The world is dying for a bit of beauty. And for a while, we can deliver that. Will this be my car? Ah, in good time love, in good time. Do you got your first assignment? Ah, good.

Every time I look at you I feel like I know you. - You feel that way? - No. Do you believe in reincarnation? No I don't. Neither do I. But I do believe in ghosts and I believe in life on other planets and I know for a fact whales have a higher intelligence level than human beings. Shut up and get in bed here. You do not tell me what to do! I'm sorry. You do not order me around! My mistake. I saw what you did with your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend! Well good for you. Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! Fine! You have a lot to learn about women. Oh, don't tell me what I got to learn. I know about you. You don't know anything about me. I see how you treat women. Back off. You treat them like rats. That's enough! You boss everybody around. I do not! You do too! And everybody doesn't work for you and you don't own the world! You're pushing it. Didn't your dad ever teach you a little thing about humility? Wait a minute, now you're way out of line here! No you're way out of line and don't try to pull that military bullshit with me! I'm not trying to pull anything, I'm trying to get you in bed! Well then try something different! Oh no you don't, don't go to sleep. What? You did this to me last time. Did What? You're gonna wake up and be an asshole. And not talk to me anymore. No I won't. How do I know that's true? Because I'm a new man. You swear? I swear. Go to sleep. What's your full name? Dr. Jekyll. Excuse me sir. What is it, O'Brien? It's about the girl. I was wondering would you know where she is? She's on assignment. Yes but she wasn't here this morning. She left yesterday. Oh I see, an overnight job. That's right. Don't worry, O'Brien. Mr. Witherspoon's little friend is just fine. She'd better be, sir. Is that a threat? No sir, no. That is a fact. Good morning. Do you remember me? Marry me. Oh, you remember me. Down the aisle. You're one very weird man. - I mean it. - Mean what? I want you to be my wife. Right. - Say yes. - No. Why? I don't know you. You know me. I do know you. What's your name? Doesn't matter. I do like you a lot, but you're awfully odd. Who are you? You don't want to know. What are you, a convict? You'd better give me an answer. You're serious, aren't you? I'm very serious. This is all going too fast. Just slow down and let's get dressed. Get out of here and walk. Hi guys! Oh there you are. Where the hell have you been? I don't care where you've been. Look where you are now! Get your wicked little butt out of our room. For god's sake, Jenkins. - Your room? - Our room. Not you too. She got no business in here. Now goddamnit that's it, all of you! Go on now, get out of here! How come? Because you don't belong here. This is the drivers' room. This is the men's room. Where's the toilet? That's it girl, you tell 'em. You get the hell out of this room right now. Oh, what are you so worried about? I'm not gonna get girly bugs on you. We change our clothes in here. If I see something I haven't seen before, I'll throw a rock at it! You won't be throwing rocks at my John Thomas. Now go on, get out! - Now! - Move it! March! You guys. Come on darling. You and I can find much better company in a morgue. I don't want to spend time with these gentlemen. Let's go find a stranger. I've always relied on the kindness of strangers. For all my needs. Why good morning, Mr. Battle. Billy Ray. Could I get you something, sir? No, no thank you. Oh, Billy Ray, orange juice. What the hell's happened? You look like you enjoyed your trip. Good news. Good, I need some good news. I'm getting married. You and Colleen got back together? No, it's not Colleen. - Who? - It's one of your drivers. The girl? No, it's Doolittle, we're leaving for Vegas tonight. Boy, does she know who you are? Does she know you're my son? No, I spared her that. Why, don't you think you're rushing this? Yes, we are. Don't you want to try to get to know her a little better first? I can't explain this but I feel as though I've known her my whole life. Billy Ray, get O'Brien over here. - We have a problem. - Yes sir. Coffee please, very strong. And very black. God damn you LaRou Lamet! I'm sorry Charmaine! Sorry don't count. - I know. - You don't know jack shit. Do you see this dress? It's very pretty. Yes well it better be because it cost me $150 and do you see these shoes? They cost me $75 and the more money you spend on shoes the less you can walk in them, do you understand? We don't have to walk. Well how the hell are we gonna get there, crawl? We can catch the bus. This is my one opportunity to go to a party and meet somebody important and I'm not going on no goddamn bus. I trusted you. You told me that you were gonna get a car. They turned down my loan. Well what made you think the bank was gonna give you a loan anyway? I was gonna get it through my school. School my ass, you're a janitor. I go to night school. Yeah and I guess you're gonna be a lawyer. Yes I am. You a liar. Why didn't you call me this afternoon and tell me that you did not have a car? 'Cause my uncle Charles said he was gonna take us. Well your uncle Charles is off drunk somewhere as usual. Yeah I guess he is. But how could I have known? Knowing your uncle Charles you should have guessed. Mr. Lamet, your car is here. Your uncle wasn't able to come. He left instructions with me to pick you up. I'm a bit late. Please forgive me. Oh, oh, that's alright, no harm done. Thank you. You're welcome, sir. Marry me. No. I don't know what I've done to make you so mean. You just tell me what it is and I'll make it up to you. You just give me the word. I'll cut your grass, wash your dog, butter your toast. But until you tell me what I've done wrong, we're gonna be stuck out in the cold. Smart, aren't ya. Not really. Nice talking to ya, babe. It is babe, isn't it? Your excellency, do you want to wait for your bodyguard? What do you mean, what do I look like, his manicurist? I'm his body guard. I'm his American bodyguard. You see that? He's got a whole bunch of bodyguards. Those towel heads out there, those are his Arabian bodyguards. They protect him from sandstorms coming up in his face, camel farts make him nervous and I protect him from those guys 'cause there was an article in Scientific American and it said that these Iranian guys, they get the sun beating on their head and they go wacky, they get out of the sun they go apeshit and they attack their superiors, they kill generals and stuff. And so I'm here to protect him from them. Is that alright with you, your excellency? Of course it's alright, his bodyguard. Why wouldn't it be alright? Just drive, would you? Just don't ask no more questions, drive. Where to, the embassy? Embassy, come on man. What planet are you from, sugartits, Saturn with the rings around your head? The embassy club, they ain't had a party at the embassy club for 18 months and I was there, I was at that party, it was okay, but they're gone now. What do you wanna do? You wanna party, you wanna get down? 'Cause go to Alvarado and Sunset and step on it, okay? Can't go to the embassy club, no. So you're all set man, you are boarding the fun time express, what's your name man, eh? I'm Bone, I'm Bone man, nice to meet you, Bone. Now what's your name, huh? What's your name? Abdul, right? Abdul, hey, nice to meet you man. Abdul, my name's Bone, I'm gonna tell you why I'm here. I am here to save you some money. I was watching your whole operation, it's a good operation, it's real good, but you've got all them dune dumpers and camel jockeys running around. You got what, four, five of them? How much you paying them guys, like 150 a week American? I'll tell you how you can save some money. First of all you hire Bone, you already done that, you'll be taken care of. But first thing I'm gonna do is tell you how to carry your money. You don't carry your money right here. Someone could come along, they can just steal the money, they can just have the money. Next thing I'm gonna tell you is why do you have those guys along with you? You got the guys along with you so that you can make appointments. Important man like yourself you've got to be on time for all these things when you wanna buy out like whole corporations in the US, you can't be 10 minutes late. You know one of the major problems here is you ain't got a good watch. Oh yeah, this watch is, I mean this is a good watch, I'd neverjive you and say this wasn't a good watch. This is a very good watch, I like this watch, but this watch doesn't help you at all. Here's the watch I got right here, this is a calculator watch. Okay, okay. So you can figure out how many barrels of crude you're selling, but it also has got an alarm on it, okay. 80 say you got an appointment to buy out a cinema corporation in the USA, you set it for like 10 minutes before the appointment, then you can get there. Okay now I'm gonna give you this watch and you're a buddy of mine, I like you a lot, but the problem with you is I can't take this watch for this high tech thing. This is just an old piece of junk. This is an antique basically. Hold onto it for 200 years, you could sell it for 100 bucks more but now it's not really worth that much. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this watch, you take that watch, you enjoy it, put it on. All that's gonna cost you is 100 bucks which I'll take right here myself. Are you familiar with this game? This is the game called the oil baron. The oil baron and the dry wells. This here is the oil baron, see that right here? That's the oil baron, that's you. That is Abdul Clampett, okay? He's got all this crude around and these are two dry wells and all you gotta try to do is you gotta try to find you gotta try to find the oil baron. Okay there it is right there, keep your eye on it, there we go. Oil sheik's right there, okay, there he goes, and where is he? Okay he's right there. You're good at this game man, you are damn good at this game. I may be in real trouble here. Okay let's say since you're so good at it I'm a sporting guy let's do it this time for the ring. Okay, don't do it for the ring, hey, back off, I don't need that at all. All we're gonna do is do it a little bit for your money, okay. Give you a little money here, I'll put up some of my money and you put up some of your money, okay, and you hold onto that right there. Okay so here we go now you watch closely now. Keep this straight for me, would ya? I'm trying to work here. Now you see you got your oil sheik here. Okay now where's the oil sheik at, tell me, where's the oil sheik, where's the oil sheik? Ah, you got dry well again Dul, you got a dry well Abdul my man. I'll take some of your money back. And I'm hold onto this. As a matter of fact let me see these other stakes that are going up. We need a little bit to have fun with. You don't want to squander your money man. Let's play for the watch. Let me just take this watch, I like this watch and Abdul I'll take it back because you know you can always buy another one with all the money you got. Okay now watch closely. This is for the watch, this is for the watch. Straighten this out, straighten this out. Here we go. Here's the oil sheik, okay, here we go. Watch him closely, where's he at, where's he at? Where's that oil sheik? Where is he, where is he? Ah you got a dry well. Man I got the watch. But listen, we're having a lot of fun, aren't we? And I got the wallet, okay, I'll take care of that, that's part of the job as bodyguard and I'm kinda giving you entertainment here. The problem is man you're going to my club and this is the club that I hang in. And the problem is I'm gonna be walking in with a guy who's dressed like a waterbed and I don't mind that, I don't mind ever the way someone's dressed but you've got to have the proper attitude, we've got to get you a 'tude. See it doesn't matter how you dress and how you look. Even a guy like you can get laid but you've gotta have the proper 'tude. Now you work on that, okay. That goes for you too, sugartits. A lot of 'tude for us. Now just chow down on the whole thing. Blow it out now. That's good, that's good. You've got a whole box, I've got another box in my pocket here.

This one here is on Bone. Your excellency. Abdul, Abdul. Got your wallet here. You're fresh out of scratch but you've got your credit cards and those should get you home. Keep those safe 'cause people can sell them. Thank you. You kidnapped an ambassador. Not me. Who was driving? That is not fair. They had the police and the secret service looking for him all night now all you had to do was call in but now you don't bring him home til six in the morning with a pimp and a carload of naked women. He had a good time. You're running a goddamn whorehouse on wheels, woman, I can't have that. - But- - No. - But- - No. - But- - No more buts. You're fired. Now just get out. Fine. I was starting to like that little girl. How'd you find me? I've been looking for you all day, what's wrong? - I got fired. - What? - Got fired. - What for? Running a whorehouse. I can get your job back. How? You trust me. Trust you, I don't even know you. You know me. You're a class act. So are you. No, my mother was a housemaid and nobody knows who my father was. - Come here. - What? Just come over here. I think it's time you met my father. Come in, children. Father, Casey Meadows. Casey, my father, Robert Witherspoon. Mr. Roosevelt? Yes? You're Mr. Witherspoon? Afraid so. You two know each other. You're the one who sent me the letter? Yes. What letter? He hired me. Who's Mr. Roosevelt? You're Mr. Witherspoon's son? I'm afraid so. He's the one that hired me. Why have you been doing this? Who is Mr. Roosevelt? I've been keeping my eye on you for a long time. How come? You two know each other. - No. - Yes. Ha. Casey, look at this room. Don't you remember? I've been here before. Yes. My mom worked here. Yes. Oh! I played here! Yes you did. The last time you two saw each other you were five years old. Marry me! - Yes. - No. Why not? Children, sit down. What's wrong? You can't marry this girl. Why not? Because she's your sister. - You're my father? - Yes. How'd that happen? It happened very fast. One weekend. Your mother was an extraordinary woman. And your mother was out of town. Oh. Uh oh. What's wrong? We've been bad. Oh very bad. Forgive me sir? Can't it wait, Jeremy? I believe this is something you'll want to hear, sir. What is this? This is Giles, sir. Your old driver. Oh no. Oh yes. And Giles has something he wants to tell you sir. Don't you, Giles? You ain't the girl's father. How would you know? I was married to her mother. You were married to my mother? Yes. And she was pregnant before your little weekend together. Good lord. That's why you've been so mean to me, 'cause you're my father? Why didn't you tell me? Why would you want me for a father when you could have had the rich Mr. Witherspoon and all his millions? What? If I'd have kept my mouth shut you could inherit all his money. I didn't want his money. I wanted a father. For a father you wouldn't want the likes of me. I am the likes of you. How did you know all this? I had it from the girl's mother, sir. I never told you this before, but I knew her myself. You knew her too? Oh yes sir. Yes indeed. She was quite a girl. Don't forget your pal! Now you're my father too. Home, James.
