[music playing] Take me there, Ken. Take me back. Let's go-- MICK FLEETWOOD: The reality was, there would be many incarnations of Fleetwood Mac, and this Rumors incarnation is, without any question, it's a huge mind set deal involving success and a huge amount of music put out. And the only resemblance to that was the original Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, which was very short lived. So we'd had all the number one hits and the screaming girls and stuff like that. And come back from it, if you like. Gone down from it. And then come over to America and had a period where we were feeling out and so going forward. And then suddenly, again-- Mick Fleetwood was looking for a studio to record an up-and-coming album. And I think he suspected that Bob Welch was going to be leaving the band. Bob Welch was the guitarist that I replaced. But at this particular time, he was just looking for a studio. Keith Olsen had engineered the Buckingham Nicks album. And so Keith put a track from that up for Mick to listen to, really just to demonstrate his own engineering skills. Well, Mick had not only bought into Keith's engineering but also had bought into my guitar playing. Mick sort of came back and said he'd found this fantastic guitar player. And we didn't know who the girl was at the time. Because it was really only guitar player that we were interested in at the time. I was asked if I wanted to join. And I said, sort of politely, that Stevie and I were a package deal. In the next three days, I went to the record store and bought all the Fleetwood Mac records and listened to them back to front. And pretty-- I made the decision. Pretty much, you know, Lindsey said, what do you want to do, you know? I basically said, I think we can add something to this band. Once you got in the studio, there's that-- I won't say magic, but there was a core. We are doing something that is worthwhile here. This music is happening. Stevie's song, Chris's song, Lindsey's song, whatever. It's happening. [music playing] LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM: It all seemed to come together very quickly. Stevie and I had a backlog of material. And it was easy for the three people to make choices, which reflected something that-- something that would hang together with Christine's material. And certainly the vocal blend was very important. Just the personalities of the three writers, distinct yet hanging together as a trio. All of that helped to kick in the success of Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood Mac, the first album that Stevie and I were involved with with Fleetwood Mac. And it was really after Rhiannon, the second single, kicked in, that people started saying, Fleetwood Mac with hits, my, God. [music playing] She rings like a bell through the night, wouldn't you love to love her? She rules her life like a bird in flight. Who will be her lover? Once in a million years of loving like a bird rising. Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone. And your life knows no answer. And your life knows no answer. Rhiannon. Rhiannon. Rhiannon. The Fleetwood Mac album before Rumors was just starting to do well. And by the time Rhiannon came out, it was a major hit. I think it was up to almost three or four million by the time we were in the studio. Or at least over a mil. And so there was suddenly-- suddenly, it wasn't just a matter of going in and having fun and doing what we do. Do your music. Don't worry about it. Don't be self-conscious. Suddenly we had a definite reason for doing a great job. When it came time to do Rumors, Lindsey pretty much took the point on that, because he had the-- he was the one with the strongest opinion. He probably had more vision than any of us. The rest of the band had a lot of experience with blues, which is where they came from. But blues is more like a live thing. It's more-- you know, blues comes more from the heart. And it's not as forcefully created as, like, pop music, shall we say. And Lindsey really had the craft of record making. MICK FLEETWOOD: By the time we got to Sausalito to start Rumors, the roller coaster was in motion. The two challenges really. One was a musical challenge, make another Fleetwood Mac album. And two was knowing what was going on personally, which was everyone splitting up because Stevie, Lindsey, they were very much a couple. Basically, in many ways married, although they were never married. And John and Chris, who were married. JOHN MCVIE: In my personal life, you know, I was going through a divorce. Which was like a semi divorce. And then living with someone, buying a new house, not buying a new house. Said OK, do the next album in Sausalito. And I went, great. We're out of Los Angeles. This will be focused. We were all writing songs about each other, basically. Although we were unaware of it. At the time all the songs were about our own private relationships and our own troubled relationships. And I think it was Jon that suggested the name Rumors because we were writing sort of journals and diaries about one another, in which we hadn't realized until we heard all the songs all strung together. The guys had just come off a great album. And all the writers had some ideas. And we went up to Sausalito to cut the tracks. And basically, what happened, everybody would get down and start to play something. Well, for Christine, You Make Loving Fun was almost done in your head, I think. She had this great riff. And Mick, John heard that. they said, Wow. We need to come to get to the instruments. [music playing] So now they're playing and Lindsey's hot on the way over to his guitar. Christine and I somehow had a common foundation, even though she was trained and I was not. And even though her background was in the blues. We had a very similar musical sense, a very similar melodic sense in many ways. So that we could jam on the guitar and piano, and it would just spark off. She would play around me, and I would play around her. (SINGING) I never did believer in the ways of magic. But I'm beginning to wonder why. CHRISTINE MCVIE: That was about my then-boyfriend at the time who, for obvious reasons, since he was our lighting director, was not welcome in the studio. And so it was a little awkward having him come to visit, because, you know, wherever John was, he couldn't be. So I guess we couldn't have seen very much of each other when he used to come and see me. But oh, there was some very delicate moments while we were recording, sure. (SINGING) Whee, wonderful you. You make me happy with the things you do. MAN: When John and Chris broke up, me and John did a lot of traveling in station wagons together. And I knew John and Chris so well-- (SINGING) This feeling bothers me wherever I go. You've got the pressures of being on the road for a start. And living together. And seeing everybody at their best and their worst, literally their worst. And with Chris, she saw me at the worst one time too many. And bless her heart, she said, enough. I don't want to be around this person. So we talked about it. And made the decision. But at the bottom of all of that stuff was-- we have something musically that we can achieve. MICK FLEETWOOD: It was not easy for John I don't think it was easy for Chris either. But just as a man I saw a lot of pain for John And now we are as good friends as ever but at that moment, it was awful. Because you were told by someone that you adore and love, and still do, that I don't want you in my life anymore. (SINGING) Beginning to wonder why. Yeah, you make loving fun. But I've a feeling it's time to try. JOHN MCVIE: The bottom line was this is what we do. We make music and accept this as an unfortunate situation. [music playing] One of the hard things was to see John so sad. I mean, we actually didn't talk at all. John and I did not talk. Stevie and Lindsey didn't get on very well either. But they used to fight, you know. Whereas, John and I used to just avoid each other. They used to fight, although not all the time. They could, in actual fact, get on quite well, especially when they were writing songs together. John and I did not write songs together, and we did not talk, period, except for the civilities in life, like what key is this song in, you know. That would be more or less it, and so we just spent six months in that studio avoiding each other. At that time, it was at the record plant Sausalito, which was the beginning-- actually mid-70s, which was a unique time in Sausalito anyway. It was just, I guess, the end of the hippie movement. And there was a lot of drugs flying around, and far out people, and things were not based on reality in that town anyway. And here's the Record Plant, you know, situated right in the middle of all this. The record Plant back then was all wood and dark. I guess somewhat good for creating, but we never saw-- there's no windows in this place. We never saw the sun. I didn't know what time of day it was half the time. I know everybody really bitched about it first. Everybody wanted to stay in their own homes and be comfortable. And I believe Mick was very insistent about taking everybody out of that environment so that we would have nobody to count on but ourselves. Right up through here. Strange to think that the last time I saw you in this room was, like, 21 years ago. 21 year. Wow. Glad you survived, Richard. Thanks. Glad you did too. We all made it. You too, Ken. - We all - Made it, didn't we? It's great to see you. It really is. STEVIE NICKS: We really wondered whether or not we would get through Rumors. Again, you know, in this studio, in that room in there, in that tiny little room, there was five people that were totally breaking up. Whatever was going on in the band, specifically between the two couples, very much informed the material. And I think that was a very great appeal of the album. If you look at the success that Rumors enjoyed, I think that it goes a little bit beyond the music itself. I think a resonance kicks in that has to do with the interaction of the people, the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. And I think a tangible element of that is the fact that you had these dialogues shooting back and forth between members of the band about things that were happening to all of us while we were recording these songs. [music playing] (SINGING) Thunder only happens when it's raining. Players only love you when they're playing. They say women, they will come. And they will go. When the rain washed you clean, you'll know. STEVIE NICKS: Dreams was written on one of those nights where there was nothing for me to do. So I went down the hall to a studio that was here in the Record Plant that was Sly Stone Studio. And when I had nothing to do, I could take all my stuff down there. And so I would take a electric piano with me. And you know, my crocheting and my journals and my books and my art. And I'd just kind of just stay there, you know, until they needed me. So one day, sitting in Sly Stone's bed, with this big black curtain bed, fabulous, you know, totally. It wasn't my room, so it could be fabulous. It was somebody else's room. I just went in there one afternoon and wrote Dreams. And it was-- and I knew when I wrote it that it was really special. And I was really not self-conscious or insecure about showing it to the rest of the band. I knew they were going to really like it. This is pretty much what it sounded like in the first few days of working on it. (SINGING) Now here you go again, you say-- Once again, John will be-- and you can recognize that bass line anywhere. (SINGING) Well, who am I to keep you down. There you go, signature John McVie, the Fleetwood bass drum line. It's always difficult to give your song to somebody and know that they're going to take it to places you can't take it. Because, you know, they play guitar and piano and arrange music, you know. If they do a good job, then it's great, you know. If they don't, then it's not great. Then you wish you hadn't given it up. Or you wish you'd been more involved. Or you'd wish you'd been there more, you know. Or something, something goes wrong. Lindsey had an amazing way of taking my songs and making them wonderful. When he was-- when he was happy with me. When we mix these songs, we usually look for the heart and soul of a song. And we'd kind of tear this mix down in different areas and see what worked, what didn't work. And what did we build a song around. And you can see right there, that's pretty well the core of the song. [music playing] Whatever Stevie's music was, somehow, I was this soul mate that just knew exactly what to do with it. And that never went away. It just became a little bittersweet, in terms of wanting to do it. There were times when I had the urge not to want to help her. And that's a weird thing to admit, but these were the challenging things. [music playing] (SINGING) Now there you go again, you say, you want your freedom. Well, who am I to keep you down? It's only right that you should play the way you feel it. But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness. Like a heartbeat drives you mad in the stillness-- Dreams is a great example of the band just pulling it together. Stevie and Lindsey, when they were solo, lived together. And Stevie could wrap her voice around Lindsey's so well. He'd do harmonies with her. She'd do harmonies with him. It was really a great blend. When they joined Fleetwood Mac, Christine came in, and the three of them created the sound. It was amazing. And it was even more amazing for me, because they oftentimes had to sing on one microphone or on three microphones in a small room, looking at each other. And you can imagine the turmoil they were going through when all these relationships are breaking up. And through all the turmoil, they'd come out with vocals that sound like this. [lyric] Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining. What we have here is Chris and Lindsey doing the main vocal, and Stevie doing two harmonies. (SINGING) Say women, they will come and they will go. When the rain washes you clean, you'll know. You'll know. [music playing] You know I came in certainly as the new kid on the block. But I also came in as the kid who had some ideas. John and I used to butt heads quite a bit in those days. And I think a lot of that was my fault. Some of it certainly was his fault, as well. But it just took me a long time to learn to appreciate John's approach. [music playing] Well, do you want to go through it again? I'd like to get home. Well, as a songwriter, he has his-- obviously, his point of view. And as a bass player, that's what I do. Say, well, maybe it should be this way. So we definitely butted heads, as it were. But it was never an ego thing. It was always whatever came out was for the betterment of the song. Lindsey knew what the hell he was doing. And he knew why he wanted to do it. And he saw that point that he wanted to get to. And he would know, as he still does today, he knows when he hasn't got there. And he gets relatively crucified sometimes, in terms-- including himself-- on that journey. Secondhand News was considered really a front runner to be the opening track on the album from early on. And the song itself consists of a kind of Scottish Irish folk influences. And when we first started cutting it, I think, we were doing it with something that was a more literal translation of that. In other words, maybe a march time on snare with brushes, or some odd thing. But we were also very interested in keeping the pop element, since it was going to be the first song. And it was a pop album. And they were-- so we really opted for just more of a dance beat within the confines of what that was. I think I'd even heard Jive Talking by the Bee Gees, and sort of pulled a couple of textures from that, which you will hear. [music playing] (SINGING) So in other words, you have this, which was a chair, and more of a dancey snare. And that replaced the marching time. Then we also thought that maybe where I'd wanted to put a guitar solo in, that maybe the presence would be better served by the use of a vocal. So you have this. With the guitar. And that's pretty much the essence of the song, right there. Things would come out in a very raw and pure form. And so what ended up getting on the tape was emotion and feeling without a middleman. You know, it was without any tempering it was just, you know, if you are in a shitty mood, I'll-- let's do, let's to out and do this guitar anyway. I don't care, you know. Crying, fine. Let's do this drum part. You know, and a lot of that went onto the tape. Well, the machinery of it, the role of it, had already gotten so great, that there was never any consideration of, you know, do we want to stay together. Or do we want to approach this in another way. We just had to play the hand out. And the only way to do that was to take all of these feelings, say, my feelings for Stevie, and vice versa. And to sort of cram them into one corner of the room. And then to get on with whatever was going on with your process in the rest of the room. It was unfortunate that we all had to be together to get over it, you know. You would like to be able to go away and get over it, and then come back, you know. But we really-- and we did get over it. We all got over it, you know. We got over each other. It took a long time, but it did happen. [music playing] MICK FLEETWOOD: I was not spared at all. My best friend was having an affair with my wife, Jenny. And he was sort of still a friend. Yeah, because he-- and he still is. You know, he's a great chap. And I was sort of happy that-- if someone's going to do that, that it was him, rather than someone I didn't know. It's like a weird-- that was all twisted too. It was a total mess, and that's how we made that album. With John and myself, we've managed to maintain a good friendship. Time does have a habit of healing, and that's, I guess, is a cliche. But that's why it is a cliche, isn't it? Because over the years, we've been forced into working together. And spend a lot of time forgiving each other. And now I can quite safely say that I feel him to be more like a brother to me, a good brother as well. Chris? What? Smile. And so this is the front. And then on the back, we have the group shot, which you need. But the magic about the back, and one of the high points of all the images on the inner the sleeve and the entire package for me, is this top series of photos that we did at a rehearsal. Stevie, now I want your face to come over John's shoulder. When John walked across to hug Lindsey, at this particular time, nobody was getting along a lot. You know, the divorces. And if you notice, you'll see Lindsay is a little bit put off, because he doesn't know. You know, this wasn't staged. It was just-- John just spontaneously walked across and hugged him. And when John walked across, I just kept clicking and popping. And when he hugged him, Christine took a hold of Stevie, and I mean, poor Mick, out in the cold. You know, he's like everybody's hugging everybody. And poor Mick got left out in the rain. And then this to me is just the shot. You know, I don't-- this is not a big deal to me. This is a big deal. Because it's an expression of love. As this is. [music playing] (SINGING) Go your own way. Tell me why everything turned around. And it's play-- this is played majorly still on the radio. Later on we added percussion to this. You'll hear Mick playing a-- What was I playing? I know it was a cymbal thing, like a bell thing. It's right here. Just like that song that the Move did. You've got the maracas. That last five-track thing. Cymbal. [music playing] That part, to me, was really in a way the defining part of the song. It was the glue that brought the whole song into focus. And that was very, very late in the game. That almost didn't make it on the record. But to me, without that, the whole thing would not have had the counterpoint that it needed. That's the support for the vocal. And in a way, it's the one thing that kind of dis-- is disorientating as far as where the actual groove is. And you don't really know or that groove is until the first chorus kicks in. And it's kind of a surprise. So if you were to, in other words, play the track without that part, it would sound like this. And what I'll do is I'll bring that part in at some point, and you can hear the difference. [music playing] (SINGING) Loving you isn't the right thing to do. How can I ever change things that I feel. And-- If I could, baby, I'd give you my world. You can go your own way, go your own way. You can call it thunder, your lonely day. You can go your own way. Go your own way. Lindsey just kept playing these great parts, and I couldn't let them go. (SINGING) You can got your own way, go your own way. You can call it thunder. Listen to John, listen. It's like a whole orchestra going on. He's creating a whole counter-- It's that magic. You're a monster, John. Dreams was hopeful. You know, it saw the breakup coming, but it was hopeful that we would be OK. Unlike Go Your Own Way, which was not hopeful that we would be OK, you know. That was the thing Lindsey and I argued about a lot, was that I try to be somewhat optimistic in my songs, somewhere. You know, to pull out some kind of ray of light at the end of the tunnel. I don't make up stories. They have to be real. [music playing] (SINGING) Back on gold dust, woman. Take your silver spoon. Take your gray-- Gold Dust Woman was a little bit about drugs. It was about, you know, keeping going. It was about cocaine. And you know, after all these years, since I haven't done any cocaine since 1986, I can talk about it now, you know. But it was, at that point, it was-- I don't think I've ever been so tired in my whole life as I was when we were, like, doing that. You know, I think it was shocking me, the whole rock and roll life was really heavy. And it was so much work. And it was so everyday intense, you know. Being in Fleetwood Mac is like being in the army. It was like you have to be there. You have to be there. And you have to be there as on time as you can be there. And even if there's nothing you have to do, you have to be there. So Gold Dust Woman was really my kind of symbolic look at somebody going through a bad relationship and doing a lot of drugs and trying to just make it. Trying to live. You know, trying to get through it to the next thing. Stevie used to write from the center out. And I think that gave us, as musicians, sometimes an opportunity to get a little looser, a little more abstract. And this is a good example of that. The song is very dark. It's quite loose. And somewhat acrimonious. I am guessing that the acrimony was directed at me at the time. But anyway, you have parts like this. [music playing] Harpsichord. Steel drum. A Fender Rhodes. Then I think the loosest part of all. That's what-- I'd say we were under duress. I don't know exactly how to say it in any other way, except that, you know, everybody in this room, go back and think about your really serious passionate relationship of your life that completely falls apart. You don't see that person the next day. You don't see them the next morning. With us, you know, we'd spend 15 hours in the studio. And everybody is completely upset. And go home and be back to work 10 hours later. So in that room, in a tiny room with a couch that sat three people. And a chair. I mean, there was always pockets full of people that you could go and talk to. But there are obviously certain rooms in the studio that you'd just walk in the door and go, I can't possibly go in there. And so, there were elements of it that were really awkward. Steve and Christine had rented a condo that they were sharing together in Sausalito Harbor, or an area of that harbor. I don't think I ever went there. I don't believe I ever went there. It was like off bounds to men or something. Yes, I mean, Stevie and me rented a condominium. Two condominiums, actually. So we had one each. And in the same building. So we had already bonded, sort of, on the road on the first tour since we didn't have any money. And we could only afford to, you know, share rooms at that time. And so when we moved to Sausalito to make Rumors, we definitely, we were the only ones we knew. We only had each other. Not only were we good friends anyway, and had we become close since the band began. But we really didn't have anybody else. So we had each other. And we were very, very close. You know, we would like-- I would hide in her room some nights. And she would hide in my room some nights. And we would hear, you know, John would be very upset, walking up down the hall. He's screaming her name. You know, it was horrible. And all the guys, all the lads, were up at the Record Plant house, up in the hills. And God help you what went on there. You know, I mean, this was a wild, crazy time. Well, you really have to address it in terms of the times. And the times were just a lot crazier. There was a sense of expansiveness in the business. Of anything being possible. Of budgets not being important. And certainly there was a subculture of drugs that was considered almost the norm in the business back then, as opposed to today where it's a bit more of an aberration. That was sort of the last period of time when, maybe there was a kind of us and them feeling, of establishment versus anti-establishment. It was grinding to a halt as the business got tighter. But in the mid-70s, there was a sense that you could do no wrong. At the time, it didn't seem as if we were doing anything wrong. Seemed like it was all just part of the lifestyle. In retrospect, it was stupid. At that time, it's like-- that was what was, at that time. Oh, yeah, you want to do this? Yeah. Jesus. It got really bad in the end of the '70s. I mean, that's when we were all, I think, in the worst shape of all. And we were probably doing the best music of all, you know, which is a terrible balance thing. The fact is, is that sometimes misery and drugs and lots of money and cars and self-indulgent ways, you know, that it can destroy you. During the early part of the sessions in Sausalito, when Ken and I hadn't quite our foot int yet. We'd just kind of met everybody. I mean, I knew Stevie and Lindsey quite well. I didn't know the rest of the band. Ken didn't know everybody that well. And Ken conceived of this joke. A certain bag that they were keeping in the control room that we had control over while they were playing. And they asked for it at some point. They were always asking for it. They were always-- and Ken thought of this idea, which I'll let him explain what happened. Everybody's in their-- their iso booth. We knew sooner or later someone is going to say, could you bring that bag out? So, you know, I think we'd been thinking about it for a couple of days. - Yeah. So we'd set up. We'd made a duplicate bag. Put it on the console. I remember I rolled the bag up the wrong way, purposely the wrong way, so the top was-- I was holding actually the bottom of the bag. And so I walked out, in my hand, and I said, here, you guys go. And I let my hand go, so the bag would unroll. And everything started falling out. Unbelievable. With the bag. And they're all there, strapped in. Speechless. Yeah, Ken, Ken, Ken-- Stop, stop. What are you doing? Of course, Ken plays the role perfectly. He looks more like an oaf, you know-- because-- What, what are you talking-- And as they start to yell at him, he's getting real excited, like, what? What? And this stuff is flying all over the place. And they're panicking and actually genuinely getting mad. Until, I think, I started roaring with laughter in the control room. I couldn't hold it any longer. I think at that point, they realized it was a joke. But I think Fleetwood was actually getting a little upset there. Mick, I think, I remember being not so pleased. John was ready to die right over the baffle. Never going back again. Well, let's see. As I recall, this was at a time when Stevie and I had pretty much parted company. This was near the end of the making of Rumors that we did this. [music playing] I had met a young lady. It didn't turn into being anything heavy. But what it did do was sort of put a little wind in my sails, in terms of the sense of having sort of a regenerative spirit about things. And being able to sort of move on, which I hadn't really been able to do for a little while. (SINGING) Well, you don't know what it means to win. So come now and see me again. Yes. I've been down one time, I've been down two times. I've been down three times. I'm never going back again. That's the great thing about music. You know, you can be really upset, and you can go into the studio, and they play back something, and it's really good. And you know, part of you has to be happy. So there was a good-- there was a balance that kept us all from completely flipping out. The music was good enough to keep us on some sort of a even keel. I mean, how much do you have to give to a record? I mean, we gave so much during Rumors that I don't know if there was much else to wring out of us after that. Sure, we went through-- we recorded more and more records. And we did this. But as far as actually taking our bodies and wringing out every last bit of creativity, I think a lot of that went during-- you know, a lot of that happened during Rumors. I think a lot of those songs were probably maybe harder for the parties concerned than they alluded to at the time. They were talking to each other. Except the only drag was John couldn't talk back, because he doesn't sing. [laughter] [music playing] (SINGING) If you wake up, and don't want to smile. If it takes just a little while. Open your eyes, and look at the day, you'll see things in a different way. Don't stop thinking about tomorrow. Don't stop, it'll soon be here. It'll be here, better than before. Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone. Why not think about the times to come, and not about the things that you've done. If your life was bad to you, just think of what tomorrow will do. Don't stop thinking about tomorrow, don't stop-- CHRISTINE MCVIE: More laid back, not much more, but a little bit, you know. Christine McVie. Don't Stop. She's saying, hold the track back. They're looking at each other. They're checking out the feel. Everybody thinks that's the right tempo. CHRISTINE MCVIE: Rolling, ball. Don't Stop. It's a shuffle. She came down and started playing this riff. John and Mick-- Mick fell in with a high hat, shuffle thing on the drums. John came in with this killer pumping bass. Well, the victory of President-elect Bill Clinton may mean new life for the currently disbanded rock group Fleetwood Mac. When it became, you know, Bill Clinton's favorite song, that was great. That was great. That was a rush, you know, for everybody. And it was really neat that 10 years before, when that song was out, that he had, you know, that he had decided that that would be his song if he ever got to where he was going. That that would be his song. [music playing] Was that a hit or what? Later on, she went and added some tap pianos. [music playing] Lindsey added a guitar. Christine could have cut that track 10 years before it was made. And the difference would have been-- was not having this cream on the top that took it into a whole different zone where musically and rhythmically, it wasn't just a shuffle. And it's like, but that's what it is. And yet, that was this wonderful marriage where-- and we were just taking that and running with it. [music playing] Background. Everybody around a microphone. I think we even had some of the people working at the studio. Over the period of the last five years, I've come to the conclusion that I definitely have to write the lyrics first. I mean, and I've become quite prolific with lyrics these days. I mean, if ever I've got a spare bit of paper, I jot lyrics down, and I'll keep them. I'm not organized in that aspect of my life at all. I'm organized in every other department. But keeping my words, and I keep planning to put them in my computer, you know. And I never do. So it's always on bits of paper all over the house. And provided I've got lyrics, I feel that that kick starts me into the song. Songbird was a-- I mean that was a great moment for me. As I recall, everybody had gone home or were leaving. And Christine was noodling out in the studio and playing the song. And I had the mics up, and I listened. And I didn't know what she was playing, but it was gorgeous. That song required the depth of a concert hall. I had recorded Joni Mitchell at Berkeley Community Theater. Was that your idea to do it at-- - Uh-huh. - Oh, nice one. Good one. And I remember that Berkeley Community Theater was the best live recording. I mean, it had this ambience. And so well, we called over to Berkeley Community, and it was not available. I don't know what they were doing. They said, Hey, there's the Zellerbach Auditorium down the street. So we set up the truck and made the plans. We ordered the orchestral shell. Two mics go there. To go out there. I talked to the prop guy, and I said, give us three spots. Focus them on the piano. And we ordered a dozen roses, and they were laying there for her. She came out, and she just went, Oh, my God. I mean Christine is a beautiful lady. And I think that song was a real peek at her insides. You know, that's the way she's like. I believe we started doing it in the studio. And then this whole scenario came up. And it sounds like, it's just-- you should be just like Edith Piaf on an empty stage, playing and singing the song. I think it was about nobody and everybody. In retrospect, it seemed to me more like a little anthem than anything else. It was for everybody. And it was like a little prayer almost. [music playing] For you, there'll be no more crying. For you the sun will be shining. Because I feel that when I'm with you it's all right. I know it's right. To you I'll give the world. To you, I'll never be cold. Because I feel that when I'm with you it's all right. I know it's right. And the songbirds all sing like they know the score. And I love you, I love you, I love you like never before. When Chris was out the band last time, she used to do that. And me and Mick would stand in the wings, and she'd play Songbird. And grown men would weep. And I'd do it every night. So we were talking about, you know, putting the band back together. And she is here, as long as I don't have to play Songbird. And Mick's going, well, you have to. I'm saying, why, I don't want to anymore. She said, oh, you cry? [music playing] (SINGING) And the songbirds keep singing like they knew the score. And I love you, I love you, I love you like never before. Like never before. Like never before. They set up the hall with just me on the stage with the piano and some roses and champagne. And that's how it started. And continued to go on, till about 7 o'clock the following morning. You know, it was-- it took a long time. Because I had to do it in one take. I'm glad that all of the musical things that have happened to Fleetwood Mac, for the most part, have been interesting and at least somewhat successful. Certainly successful in the end that it's enabled Fleetwood Mac to continue. Whatever led up to Stevie and Lindsey joining, for instance, was a process of constantly reaching out, And changing without totally losing it. And I was definitely involved in that process. Mick's the big daddy, for sure. He became little daddy for a few years, because we were all a bit worried about him. But he's big daddy again. He's bigger than ever. He's Mighty Mick. He's great. He always has been the gel, the glue behind Fleetwood Mac. This is his life. It took a toll, looking back. On my own life. Yeah. I basically sold my soul to the company store. And I have no regrets, but if you're asking me the truth of it, I probably oversold my soul to the store. No regrets? No. No, I-- Yeah, I wished I'd spent more fatherly things with my children, for starters. That's a regret. I think it is his heart's desire. It's the thing he loves the most. And without it, Mick doesn't feel good. So you know, it's like for him, for all of the rest of us, you know, there's been times-- and lots of times, you know, where we really were ready to never see each other again, you know. And Mick is the one that-- he would never be happy that way. It's really his family, you know. [music playing] (SINGING) Ah, Daddy, you soothe me with your smile. You're letting me know-- This is a lesson in less is more. That's right. Creating much space as possible. Chris is playing an organ. I believe it is about me, Oh, Daddy. It's one of my favorite songs that she's ever recorded. I think it's a fantastic song. And I was the only father in the band at that point. I like to play, and I like to be surrounded by people. Being, hey, being a drummer, I need inherently to have a band to play with. And I'm not useless, but I'm relatively useless without that. So it's no wonder. Why would you not want to keep something going forward? That's what I've done and been party to, you know, with a lot of help from everyone. Internalized, that's probably more true than not. May very well be a form of insecurity. - Castanet thing. - Lonely castanet. So remember, throughout the whole record, every once in awhile, you'd put in this odd percussion. There's one. I don't like seeing things not all going quite right. And sometimes not great at confrontational things. So I'll always be, come on, there's a way of doing this. And sometimes you say, mate, let go of it. It's just not going to work. But often when those things were said, there were ways of making it work. But at some great cost that certainly-- my private life, my marriage, my time for children and so forth-- outside of just being a crazy man anyhow. And I was crazy. Eccentric and whatever that thing is. I wasn't quite Keith Moon. But I was I was getting there. The big fry effect. It sounds great. And Mick is not different than anybody else I know in rock and roll. All of my friends that are famous are all sorry. You know? I mean, for me the price was, you know, I never married and I never had children. Because there wasn't time. And if I had ever decided to do any of that, it would have taken Fleetwood Mac off for two years. And then the band would have broken up. So that wasn't even acceptable. That wasn't even a choice. I think the situation that you find yourself in is inherently shrouded, in a womb like. The studio itself is that. The road itself is that. And I think you can only function at your best when many of the day-to-day needs and functions are being taken care of for you. And so you do get a sense of being protected in a way. I suppose the only thing that really kept us together was the music. And it was only when we listened to them back to back, the individual songs back to back, that we realized that we got something really pretty powerful on our hands. And to a point, that sort of transcended everyone's misery and depression. Because we thought this is a really good album. We had no idea how good it was, because we'd enjoyed pretty good success with the White Fleetwood Mac album. We didn't know what we had really with Rumors, except that we knew it was a piece of work to be really proud of. And we really loved the songs back to back. And we were just kind of overawed by it, I think a bit. Rumors took about a year. And that isn't unusual by today's standards. But that was one of the most intense years that I've ever spent. One of the great shames of this record, as I look back, was the fact that we didn't have enough room or time for all the songs, you know. I mean, like, what did we have? Basically, everybody had three songs. Christine had four. Stevie had three. Lindsey had three. And we were limited to what? 24 minutes a side, for a vinyl. Which was what you could do with vinyl. It was before CD. I wish we had CD back then. But-- and I think there was one band song chain, which is-- Right. One everybody wrote. But I think a glaring example of having to leave something off-- and all the band members were prolific. They all had more songs than we could fit on. But I remember one in particular, Silver Springs, that we actually took to completion, thinking it was probably going to make it on the record. And in the end, it turned out we just didn't have the time. And it just didn't fit in the running order with the rest of the songs. And it's a beautiful song. You should play some. [music playing] (SINGING) You could be my Silver Spring. Give you Stevie by herself. (SINGING) New green, colors flashing. I would be your only dream. Your shining autumn, ocean crashing. I wrote Silver Springs about Lindsey. And we were in Maryland somewhere, driving under a freeway sign that said Silver Springs, Maryland. And I love the name. So some-- you know, that's usually how my songs that are names of stuff-- that's usually how they happen is by just loving the sound of the name. You know, so Silver Spring sounded like a pretty fabulous place to me. And you could be my Silver Springs, you know. That's just a whole symbolic thing of what you could have been to me. It's the best song that never made it to record, I reckon. Beautiful. Well, let's take it out of the box right now. Go for it. [music playing] (SINGING) Never loved me, no. Then don't say that she's pretty. And did you say that she loved you. Listen to this. [music playing] When the song was recorded, it was beautiful. But it was very long. And I am really, really touchy about shortening my songs. Because then you're going to take out a verse, or you're going to take out a chapter out of my book. And then it's not going to make sense. And I'm not going to be happy. So they did try to cut it down. And they really couldn't cut it down enough to make it work. Excellent. [music playing] (SINGING) Time casts a spell on you, but you won't forget me. When I go, I-- It's great. On the song, Christine would play like a nice simple pad, and leave it open, allowing Lindsey more room to do some nice guitar notes-- It's really well done. [music playing] (SINGING) Well, follow you down to the sound of my voice will follow you-- Some vocals there. (SINGING) Give yourself a chance. Will never get away from the sound of the woman that loved you. Woman that you fooled. I'll follow you down to-- Great song, huh? Do you remember-- do you have a recollection of when we had to break it to Stevie that we weren't going to be able to include that song in the album? I don't think she was too happy. I just went down to the Record Plant in Los Angeles. Maybe it wasn't the Record Plant. I don't know, wherever it was. I went down there, and Mick took me outside in the parking lot and said, you know, Silver Springs is not going to go on the record. And another of your songs, I Don't Want to Know, is. So you have to do a vocal on that. And I'm really sorry, but it's just the way it is. It's just the way it's got to be, Stevie. [music playing] (SINGING) I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps right on walking on down the line. I don't want to stand between you and love, Honey, I just want you to feel fine. I don't want to know the reasons why love keeps right on walking on down the line. I don't want to stand between you and love, Honey, I just want you to feel fine-- I happen to really like that song. So-- and I loved singing that song with Lindsey. Because that was one of our Everly Brothers singing things that was really close and tight and really a lot of fun to sing. So if it was going to be replaced with anything, that was a good replacement. Very few people had ever done an album that went a year over. Maybe Stevie Wonder and Songs of the Key. But I'm not sure if there were many others. So there wasn't really a precedent. So nobody warned us that the more you drag-- and it should be obvious, right? Duh. But we didn't think about it. The more you drag a tape across a tape head, that's friction. You can actually hear the taping being drug across. That's wearing the oxide off. It's wearing the tape down basically. And the first thing that goes, the high end, the high frequencies. For instance, the symbols, sibilance on the voice. Anything with high frequencies start to disappear. Well, unfortunately, it was a very subtle thing. It was almost like Chinese water torture, where you get just a little drop. And within an hour, it's like a brick hitting you, you know. It was like, here we were. And Lindsey, especially, and the rest of the band are looking at us like, well, where's the high end? Well, in those days before digital, analog tape will lose its high end if it's run over the heads repeatedly. And we had spent months and months working and reworking tunes. And the high end tends to go gradually, so you don't really notice it. One day we put up the safeties of the drum tracks. And they were so crisp and so clear compared to what we had been working on that we realized that somehow we had to get that sound of the safeties over to all the work that had subsequently been put on what we were calling our masters. What we had done is made safeties of the drum tracks right after we recorded them. And even though they were second-generation safeties, we still had fresher sounds on those safeties than we did on the actual masters. So what we had to do was take all the overdubs we'd done since, the vocals, the guitars, the bass, everything else that went on there, and sync those back in to the drum track, without a sync track. And again, in those days, there wasn't the device called SMPTE, which will lock up tape machines. So it had to be done by hand. And it took somebody with a VSO, which is a variable speed device, to be listening to the drum tracks of both machines through headphones, waiting to hear phasing, which would indicate that they were starting to drift. And manually keeping those two things in sync, which is really a task that I can't even imagine having worked. But apparently we were able to do that and get our drum sound back. Ken started off doing this by manually syncing up-- putting both tapes on the machines, wearing headphones, and listening to the snare on overheads. And he had them in mono-- I mean, stereo. So that if it was in perfect time, the snare would line up right in the center, imaging wise, in the headphones. But as soon as it started to drift, the two machines, it would sort of pull apart, and you could hear it pulling from one side to the other. And that's when you had to manually-- manually-- use the VSO, the variable speed oscillator, which changes the speed of the machine, to manually keep the other machine running in the exact time as the master. And that was hard to do. It was about a 14-hour process. You know, I don't know if I could remember all the studios we recorded this at. But I remember recording some at Criteria and in Florida or Miami. Some in Los Angeles, specifically Wally Hiders. I would have to say we probably spent the most attention to the drum tracks in recording. And in the end, we just ended up using the drums, and we'd strip everything else off, including the bass, guitar, and everything. The only instruments played live together that I can remember were on the chain, and that would have been the bass, the drums, and the lead guitar were all played together. But everything else was an overdub done at a separate time. And most of that overdub work was done in Los Angeles. Well, I remember that we did the end first. And we had John tack a base on to the end. And it sounded so good that we thought that we had to put a song to it. It just sounded really cool. [music playing] Well, the chain was an interesting song. Because they had the middle part of the chain where the solo starts, where it goes, da, da, da, da, don, don, don, don, don don. They had from that part til the end of the song. But they didn't have a song. So and-- Lindsey was very-- he wanted to finish the song himself. So he didn't let me or anybody else really help him. And finally, it just wasn't getting written. So I had another song that I had written, you know, out of the Buckingham Nicks era, that went with it perfect. So I pretty much just gave them the song, and it fit. Well Stevie's words can be pretty obscure at best, you know. I mean, sometimes, well, I didn't know what she was singing about. But , you know, in her mind, those words make complete sense. And I often used to wonder what on earth she was talking about, But then you didn't care because the words was just sounded so good. (SINGING) You don't love me now. You don't love me again. Well, I guess-- You, you, you said, you never break. You never break. You do not love me now. You don't love me now. Never, never, never, never. I can still hear you saying you would never break, never break the chain. Lindsey had that whole screaming solo. That was done in Sausalito, live. And we kept the whole thing. And then if you remember when-- Stevie came up with the words at some point. Well, Lindsey came back one day and said, I've got this great idea. We're going to lose both verses, and we're going to throw that away. Throw the-- which we actually threw the tape away. Cut in brand new tape. And he said, just the kick drum and that-- and the guitar. And it was boom. And I was going, what the heck? The man had been thinking, you see. He'd been thinking. And it was a Lindsey song, Keep Me There. And it became a Fleetwood Mac joint publishing-- Right. Song. Because everybody put their input in, and the thing just went, you know, 180 degrees. [music playing] That's a fact, that's the most important album we ever made, because it allowed this band, Fleetwood Mac, to continue for years and years and years after it. And I really feel, if we hadn't made that album, we may have-- it may have hit that the ultimate brick wall and literally stopped. It was our focus. With all the stuff that was going up and down, we did some great music. You can't imagine five more different people than this particular five. And I mean, maybe that's part of the magic of it. There was some kind of glue gluing us together. And I think it's very simply just called chemistry. To be in a big time band like Fleetwood Mac is a dream come true, with all the little nightmares along the way. But still, it's the best. If you're any good at all, you know you can be better. And you try to keep grounded in your process, in your work. And the challenge of doing that amidst the madness of the said machine-- some people can do it, and some can't. I'm not saying that I've always been able to do that. But I am saying that I've always tried to do that. And then eventually you can define yourself, or a portion of yourself, through the choices you've made. I went back, on my own, and just listened to Rumors. And I was blown away because I hadn't heard it in a while. And I really understood-- and I hate to say, I understood why it was what it was. And it just had a continuity to it. Totally. And I even-- God, I like those drum parts too. [music playing] (SINGING) Love me again. I can still- We have become naturally aware that it is 20 years since the making of this album, Rumors. It's a real trip. And we're going to go out on the road, and we're going to make some more music together. And that is great. [music playing] (SINGING) Keep us together. Chain, keep us together. Chain, keep us together. Chain, keep us together.
