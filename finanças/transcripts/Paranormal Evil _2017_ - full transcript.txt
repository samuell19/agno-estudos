Aunt Pat! Aunt Pat! Stop it! Hey. What's wrong. Oh my god, why are you shaking? It's happening again. What's happening again? I was in the tub and I thought I heard somebody or something. I don't know. It was there and it touched me and then I ran out of the bathroom, and when I came back the mirror was busted. Oh my god, are you serious? Come on Lex. What the hell are you doing taking a bath in 200 degree water for? It's obvious you opened the door too fast and you let the cold air in, and it's cracked. Are you seriously saying that right now? Look at it Paul. Look, I don't know, it's just physics. Just breath. Don't tell me to fucking breath. I'm sick of you always acting like I'm crazy, when I'm showing you these things! I'm sorry. What are you apologizing for? I don't know I just am. Just breath. Alexis? I'm getting dressed. Oh, hey Paul. Hi aunt Pat. You're almost done packing huh? What's going on? Are you okay? What happened? I must of had the bathroom too hot, and when I opened the door, I cracked the glass. Oh, well. I'll take care of that later. Just be careful in there okay? Okay. Oh, the lawyer is going to give you the deed and the keys to the house in Victorville tomorrow. Have you decided what your'e gonna do with it? You know what aunt Pat, I think I'm gonna keep it. Live in it. I mean it is the house I grew up in after all. Only if you're ready. Okay? Okay. Stay for dinner Paul, I'm making meatloaf and apple cobbler for dessert. Hmm. Homemade meatloaf or ramen noodles at the dorms. I choose homemade meatloaf. Good choice. So I was thinking that I would take a road trip with Paul, and see Dorian after we sign the paperwork. Maybe give him some money. Sweetheart, that man is gonna be locked in that nuthouse for the rest of his life. He don't need money. He needs things. I'm sure there's stuff he wants to buy. Like personal items. Besides it's his money too. Well, even after all that's happening, guess he's still your stepfather. I'm just happy you keeping us in your home. You're my family. Even though my brother doesn't deserve a daughter like you. Well, here are your keys to the house, and we're done here. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you mister. So good seeing you. Good to see you. Oh I'm gonna miss you honey. I'm gonna miss you too. We'll see each other lots okay. Alright you take care. Now be careful. Take care of my baby. You good? Yeah. Whens the last time you seen him? I think I was 15. He moved in right after my dad's overdose. He was really there for me and my mom. I guess that's why I keep trying so hard. Of course you keep trying. He's the only dad you've known. Thank you for coming. I know this isn't a normal way a guy meets his girlfriends father. I'm here for you. We don't normally do visitations like this. Have a seat Dorian. You look good, Dad. Really good. This is my boyfriend Paul. It's good to meet you sir. You're not even gonna shake his hand? I came to bring you money Dorian. I never thought I'd see you again. What happened, Dad? Why did you let her in? Dorian this is your stepdaughter. Why is she in here! Hey man she's just trying to reach out to you. You're the only family she has. Don't say anything else to him. What happened in that house? No. I didn't understand it then. What happened to my mother? I didn't understand. Tell me! Ms. King, I'm gonna have to ask you to lower your voice you're upsetting my patient. Dorian, hands in your lap. Remember your calming words. When you can talk to me like a real person you contact me. I'm not coming back here. Hey. I didn't wanna believe it. I didn't wanna believe it till it was too late. But now I see. The truth is digging it's way out it's grave. I wish it was you. I wish it was that was dead not her. No, let's go. No! Get off me! Are you okay? Alexis are you alright? It's big. Mhm. You ready? Do I have a choice? Yeah. Come on. Nice. You're aunt really kept this place up all these years. Yeah. She did. Hm. How do you feel? I feel, surprised. Surprised that I feel at home. It's been 13 years since I've been here. I'm surprised there aren't any rodents running around here. There better not be sir. Come on lets start unpacking before it gets too late. Alright. Hey. Where do you want it? I guess we should see which room we're sleeping in. Nice. It's my Dad's room. Look at this. You look just like her. Is that you? Cute. No that's my brother. Oh. I haven't seen a picture of him in ages. Joshua. You remember him at all? I do. You say I'm a crybaby, no he was a crybaby. The silence in this house was so heavy when he died. Nothing's the same after a baby's death. Yeah but my mom really blamed herself you know? He drowned in that tub right there. Jesus. Alexis, Are you sure you're ready for this? There are three rooms. This one's this biggest so I'll take this one. Kira can have my old room and I remember my mother used the other one as a sewing room after Joshua died. I think. Let's go check it out. I don't know why I'm scared. It's exactly how I left it. Do you remember it? Any of it? It's weird I don't but I feel like I lived here my whole life. Like I never left. I remember that tree. Tell Kira to keep the bed. She's a little girl anyway. Alexis. I said do you want Chinese for dinner? Yeah that's fine. Whoa. It's the basement but it's locked. You know what they say about basements. What? I didn't really have an answer prepared for that. Hey. One thing we must do is kiss in there. Every single room in this house. Every single room? Every nook. And closet. Really? Better get to it before my roommate gets here. Damn Lex! I think you drew blood. Peace offering? I'm really sorry. Forget it. How bad do you think this house is? Maintenance wise? It's not good, but it's not bad. Well that's a good thing of having a new boyfriend. I gotta be good for something. No. Wait till after we eat. No do it now. And whatever it says lets follow it with in bed. Alright. It says... New and exciting adventures await you. In bed. Hell yeah. It's about time. Hey. Kidding, do yours. It says... Hope for the best except the worst. What kind of fortune cookie is that? You forgot to say in bed. Hell no. We'll share yours. Here you can have it, I don't like the way they taste. Good lord. My roomie's here. Kira! Hey Alexis. Home sweet home huh? This place is awesome! It's got just the right amount of creepy. Come on I'll show you your room, or you can pick one there's two. I take it you already got the biggest one. Of course. Yo man you need some help? Nah, I'm good bro. Come on. It's like a time capsule in here. I know we probably should have waited. No, I like it. Hey where do you want all your crap? Right there is fine. Perfect. I'll help you unpack the car. Alright that's it. All your craps in the house. Thank you darling. Your welcome. Alright I'm heading back to LA. Why? 'Cause there's nothing to do in fumblefuck. I mean Victorville. There is plenty to do in Victorville. Oh yeah? Not in my little bed you don't. Might as well stay man, they're not gonna let you go. I feel like I've been trapped here. Now you're over the limit, you have to stay. Oh yeah? Well, in that case. Cheers. So how'd your mom get so rich? I don't know. We should invest. It's we now? Yes. We are one. One million dollars in one. You don't have any life insurance policies on me do you? You're life is full of drama already. No need to add this to the Lifetime movie. What? I'm sorry babe. Wait, what happened? I went to visit my father today and he attacked me. Shit Lex. You think he killed your mom? I don't know. I don't remember him to be that type of person. I consider him to be my father. It happens all the time. Yeah but he wasn't there when I... When you what? Can we not talk about that, I'm trying to put that all behind me. I agree, let's lighten up the mood, and play a game. Play a game? What game? Hide and seek. Hide and seek? In the dark? Yes, in the dark. What other way is there to play hide and seek? Besides it'll help me get to know the house. No but what if we... You guys are thinking too much. Hey Lex, your bedroom fits this kid perfectly. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ready or not, here I come. Who's upstairs? I found you! I found you huh! Find your own spot. No. Let's get them back. What are you talking about? Now don't play this with me, we both know what they're doing. Lets get them back. Stop. God. Crazy bitch. Son of a... Ha! Gotcha. Seriously? You didn't even try. I'm fine with all the losers alright. Wasn't even here. You're out. You lose. Let me get a chance to hide. Alexis. What happened? I saw... A what? I thought I saw a mouse. A mouse? Oh come on Lex, are you serious? I'll let you know, I'd probably scream like a girl too. I hate mice. I'll just go find some mouse traps or something. Oh man. What? It wasn't a mouse, was it? Was it? What's wrong? It wasn't a mouse. Oh come on Kira. I don't want to hear shit about a ghost. No ghosts? After what happened here? Did you guys find it? What the hell are you gonna with that? Hm, if you'd like I can demonstrate on you. How do you deal with this girl man? All she does is talk about ghosts and shit. He used to believe Ray, and I'll get you to believe too. Oh yeah? No. I'm far too sane for that shit. Listen if Alexis is seeing something she needs to let me know. If Alexis is seeing something she needs to be in a looney bin. I can't believe you would say that. I'm serious. No ghost stories. We're all adults here. Yeah, all adults playing hide and seek. Seriously, I think we should order a psychic to come in and cleanse the house. Just in case. No. You know I think that you should leave since you don't live here. You wanna be crazy, do it by yourself. Don't get in the middle of it. Ray! He's right. There are no ghosts. Ever since I've been back in this house I've been I guess you could say remembering things. That's normal. Being here is triggering childhood memories. I mean Lex, your baby brother died in here, and you found your mother dead. That's the most traumatizing thing I can think of. I don't remember being that close to my mother. What? I don't think... I don't feel like I lost somebody I love. I don't know. I don't have any fond childhood memories because of... Listen, I'm sure you and your mother were close. The memories, they're probably masked by the most daunting memory. Finding her dead, and that's very, very traumatizing Lex. You have to give yourself credit for even being able to sleep here. I have nightmares. Bad ones. Not only that, even when I'm awake. It's almost like hallucinations. Well, a drowning and a suicide occurred in this house. If your mother and brother spirits are lingering... Don't talk like that. Listen, all that psychology babble they taught you in school may help you rationalize, but Lex, there are somethings in this world that are way beyond our understanding. I think we should order a psychic to come in and cleanse the house. I do have to live here to. Oh, well thank you. I'm sure that will help you sleep at night. Anyways. You'll thank me later. Did he leave? No he's out back smoking. Stay here with her. Yeah, don't get in the middle of it. Alright, I'ma take off. Alexis is gonna kill you for smoking. I don't care. You good? Yeah. How about you? Good. I broke up with Ray. What? What the hell are you two doing here then? He doesn't know it yet. What? I do live in bumblefuck now. I don't love him. Don't you think you should... I'm gonna marry her. You know what? I don't get guys. You call her crazy and psycho behind her back hell to her face and yet, I don't get it. What? You feel like hero for sticking by the crazy chick? She's not the craziest chick I know. I'm sick of you Paul. So what are you saying? You're really gonna marry her? I guess her inheritance sealed that deal. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. What about me? I thought you wanted to be with me? She needs me. Well then next time your psycho flips out on you, don't come running into my bed. I don't have a peace offering. What you're not talking to me now? Paul? Paul? What's wrong? It was so real. What was so real? I saw my mother. The way I found her when I was eight. I was right there. It was so real. Let's go to sleep. I really hope Ray brings my mattress like he promised. He can be such a douche sometimes. You gotta tell me what you want to keep in here. I'd hate to throw away anything memorable. Just get rid of it all. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Hey. Nice touch. Like the mattress. Upstairs to the left. Oh fuck this man. I just came to drop it off. She can take it from here. Come on man. No. Let her go. Great now I have to deal with this. No you don't. No drama. No meddling. Yes I do. I don't want Ray to... To what? I don't want him to break up with her. No meddling. I have to carry this shit by myself. What a dick. You know I could talk to him if you want. No. It's fine. You have your own relationship to deal with. Hey aunt Pat. So, hows the settling coming along? Good, we're do the whole out with the old, in with the new thing. I'm not getting rid of too much, just making it mine, you know? Yeah, I understand. Hey why don't I bring you kids some dinner? No, you don't have to come all the way out here. I won't have you starving to death. I'll be fine. I'm gonna rest later anyways. Just don't forget about your old auntie okay? I'm not. I love you. Love you too honey. I'm gonna check the roof and the foundation. See if any repairs need to be made. Okay. You alright? Yeah I just hope Kira's okay. Seriously, how many times have they broken up? I'll be back. Hey. What are you doing? Just scrubbing the floor. What do you want me to do with this stuff? Just put it in the dumpster out back? Okay dokey. You gotta go. What are you doing? I'm cutting down this old bird house. The wood is rotten, besides it's bad to feed the birds... What is wrong with you? I'm not gonna get rid of everything. Can you have a little consideration and ask me before you get rid of stuff? Fine. Cuckoo. Hey. Why the hell did you leave like that? Paul, there are no pictures of me in this house. What? Pictures. There are no pictures anywhere of me in this house. They're all boxed up. I saw some hanging around somewhere. No, those are my brother. Joshua. I don't understand why they wouldn't have pictures of me hanging up everywhere. I don't know Lex. Look, try not to stress over it. Ask your aunt. I'm sure she knows what's up. She doesn't have any pictures of me this young. Let me see this picture. Were you an ugly baby? No! I was an adorable baby. Stop. Alright. You good? I'm gonna head out. Well, it was good to spend some time with you. I know. It's like you live another state. I was thinking that after you get out of your classes you could move down here. In here. Hm. Unless you know, you have to go work with your dad and I get it. No, no. It's actually not a bad idea. I can start my own construction company. Make him proud. Hey you two. Hey. Oh look. I've never seen a baby photo of you. Cute. Someone thinks it's cute. I didn't say a word. Alright, I'll see you guys later alright. Goodnight. Well, it's just me and you. Come on lets go start this new chapter in our lives. Law school for me, psycho babble school for you. Lets. Hey. What time is your first class? Did you wanna carpool? It's not till 10. You good? I'll see you later. Okay, see ya. Leave me alone! Jesus Lexi what the hell is wrong with you? I'm sorry. Let me get you a towel. I cannot deal with this. I'm sorry. Dammit. Fucking shit. Hey whats up? What's wrong? It's Alexis. How is she? Not good. Shit. Jesus Christ, Lex. Where's Alexis? Alexis. Mind if I crash here tonight? Of course not. You know I think my manifestations will go away now that I figured it out. Do you think you need to see somebody? Like a doctor or something? I'm fine. Okay. Well maybe we can focus on being a little normal now. You don't like normal, that's why you're with me. That's not why I'm with you. Hm. I don't wanna know why you're with me, I just wanna know that you are. Are you leaving? Yeah. I have class. So do you. What time is it? Six. If I leave now, I should make it to LA by tomorrow. It's not that far. See you soon babe. Oh my god. What! Hey. Are you up? Yeah. What times your first class? Wanna carpool? You're right by my job. It's not the way. Lex. I really figured it out this time. Lex. I don't like to see you like this. Hold your horses. Hold your horses. Hello? Hello, may I speak to Patricia King please? This is she. Who is this? This is nurse Amy I'm calling regarding your brother Dorian. Hey. I didn't think you'd beat me home. How are your classes? Good. Well, I don't have a lot of time. I can make you some dinner. Before I go if you'd like. It's fine. I'm telling you Ray, something's up. I don't think she went to class today. She's wearing the same clothes. I don't know what to do. Did you call her aunt? She takes some pretty heavy pills doesn't she? Yeah. Mood disorder stuff. Stuff I don't wanna deal with. I really, really should have gotten my own place. This place is starting to creep me out. She said she's already seen ghosts. Oh come on. Seriously. I think she's possessed. Alright look just, stop being as nutty as she is and call her aunt. Whatever. I wanna see you. Ha, yeah right. You miss Pauly. Would you stop that? I really wanna see you. Manana, I gotta go. She locked me away. Who Alexis? She's at the bottom of the stairs. He will be too. Alexis maybe you should lie back down. You don't see her. Not like I do. Okay, I'm calling your aunt. Don't call her. I don't wanna worry her. Besides, no one will believe you. Alexis, you're really fucking scary me. Shit. She's here. No one is here. No one is here. Lex I can't just leave you like this. Lex? Are you ready for your bath? What's up? What's the emergency now? She's babbling. I don't know what she's saying. You need to help her. I think she needs you. Okay. Stop! Stop! It's me. She's sleeping. It's never been like this. I was so scared. Thank god you came. What are you doing here? You said you missed me. Really? You hung up on me, I don't miss that. Come on babe, I'm making amends. Okay, well I'll come inside, see as that you won't let me. Shh. Paul's sleeping on the couch. What? Why the hell is he sleeping on the couch? Would you stop. What? It's 11 o'clock yo bro wake up, I got beer. I told you something happened with Lex. Shit. Damn she do that? Yes. I didn't know it was that serious. That's because you don't listen to me. It took me a while, to calm her down. Alright. That's it, You guys need to have this girl committed. It's not her. It's this house. Would you stop. It's her. She's crazy okay, just like her mother and her father. And I don't know what... Sorry I didn't mean to scare you guys. How you feeling? Much better. Thank you. Hey Ray, thanks for coming over. Hey Lexi, how you doing? Good, thanks. Good, good. I'ma take this to the fridge. I'll be back. Hey. I didn't... Hey, it's okay. I'm gonna grab a beer, do you want one? I don't think it's a good idea that you drink with the medication. Will you stop? Don't do that, okay honey. I've been going through a lot. Just been a little distraught that's all. I'm fine now. Okay. Oh fuck. I knew you'd come around Kira. Fuck, Lex. What are you doing here? Paul's in the other room. You were right about them. So let's get them back. No, no, no, no. They're fucking Ray. You and I both know it. No, no they're not. You're psycho. Why the fuck would I listen to you? Why do people always do that? Call someone else crazy. You came to me first. So wouldn't that make you crazy too? Fuck you. Fuck it man this bitch. Fuck. Fuck! Crazy ass motherfucker. I don't know if... I'm thinking of moving to Colorado after graduation. There's a company there that offered me a project manager position. A real good job. Okay. I'll come with you. I think you need to stay here. And get some help. Hey. I'll be fine. I'm making it through this. Hello? Are you okay? Yeah I'm fine aunt Pat. What's wrong? It's Dorian, you're step father, I don't know how he did it. He's out Lex. He was here in my house. He attacked me. Okay I'll send Paul to come get you. No, no he said he's coming for you. You've got to get out of that house! Lex what's wrong? It's Dorian. He's coming after me. Wait. What? We have to get out of here. He's dangerous. Oh fuck man! She locked me away. She locked me away to keep him from getting me. Oh damn man!

Not just physically but, in understanding. I don't want to harm Alexis. She's my child. But what else can I do? Who would believe the evil that's inside her? No! Josh no! I tried to tell you a million times. I think she had something to do with her father's death. I thought he was crazy when he tried to warn me about her. I really don't know how. And I know it sounds crazy but, she drowned Joshua. Then she came for me. You were next. Baby? Baby? Baby, wake up! No one would believe me. No one will believe you. No one will ever believe evil is born and lives in this child. No one will ever believe. Stop! Stop! I'm not gonna hurt you. Where is she? She lives in the house in Victorville. Dorian! Aunt Pat, what are you doing?
