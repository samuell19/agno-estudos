(girl narrator) The winter that it was too hot to snow, somebody moved into the rotting, old house next door to me. Nobody saw anyone move in. Nobody saw anyone come and go. Everybody was so busy with their Christmas shopping and hurrying around, nobody noticed anything at all, except for me and my best friend Lucas. (boy) My impossible Christmas wish is for a Redline D600 mountain bike. The Redline D600 is a really expensive bike. That's because it's made with forged alloy, which makes it light but strong for jumping berms and riding dirt hills. { never had a bike before because my social worker, Mr. McCartney, thinks it's too cumbersome, and you never know if I'll get a family with a real garage to put it in, but could ride it to school. It would save my foster dad time in the mornings. One day, I could maybe ride in a competition if practice a lot. I'm sorry, I thought it was planning hour. (boy continues) It comes in different colors with color-matched rims. 1 know I'll never get one, but if I could have one impossible wish, it would be for a Redline D600. [children clapping] (teacher) Alright! Thank you Ricky, for going first. That was very brave, very brave. And I really appreciate you sharing from your heart like that. [school bell ringing] Well, okay. Alright. Those of you that are up next week, be preparing for your speeches, okay? [cell phone ringing] [book hitting the floor] - Step off, Joey. - This isn't about you. Give me my pencils. Please? Please? Isn't Lucas polite? I've got extra you can have. Hi. Hi. Excuse me. [door shutting] Who was that guy? (Lucas) Not our business. (Lucas) Fancy bike. Man, if was a foster kid like Ricky Sanchez, I would wish for parents. He's got the Martinos. They're not his real parents. And they're not gonna buy him that bike. They've got a bunch of their own kids. Well, he was probably just too embarrassed to wish for real parents in front of the whole class. Parents are way more impossible than a bike. I guess. What are you gonna wish for? I'm gonna wish that Ricky Sanchez gets that bike. You could wish on the old Granville house for him. The old Granville house? (Lucas) My mom calls it that. {t's from some old movie she makes us watch every year. You make a wish and throw a rock at the house. If you break some glass, your wish comes true. I don't know. My mom, yeah, she just calls it an eyesore. Just look for a rock to throw. Lucas, stop. We're gonna get in trouble. Come on, Olivia. It's two wishes in one, yours and Ricky's. Go on, shout the wish! Lucas, only if you don't throw the rock. Might not work then. I wish that Ricky Sanchez got a Redline D600 mountain bike for Christm— Lucas! Sorry, I had to at least throw it. Gotta go, see you at the shop tomorrow. Yeah, see ya. (Olivia's mom) Hey, Olivia, honey. Have you finished your report? Let's go! What are you doing? I thought we were gonna watch the Auburn game together, baby? -I guess. -You guess? What do you mean you guess? 1 got popcorn, TV's on, let's go! Mom, have you ever seen anybody in that house next door? No, uh-uh. No one's ever lived there since we've been here. Yeah, well somebody left a light on. There's no power over there, it's empty. I wonder if some kids got in there. Man, I wish the owner would take care of that house. It wouldn't invite so much trouble. That's not a house light or TV. There's just no flicker. Well, it's not a ghost if that's what you're thinking, baby. Lucas thinks it's a wishing house, but you have to break some glass to get your wish. Yeah, well, Lucas is good at breaking things. -Mom? -Hmm? If you could wish for anything, what would you wish for? Well, I would wish that we would beat Alabama this year, and that my daughter would finish her report SO we can watch them do so. Let's go! Come on, baby! Okay, so out of anything in the world, that's what you'd wish for? Out of being rich, or famous, or married? [sighing] Olivia, sweetheart, it's alright to make wishes and say prayers as long as it doesn't make us unhappy with the life that we're livin". We can't always have what we want. We can't always have what we wish for, but we can be content with what we have. Are you content with what you have? Ugh! Would you get it done? Got a football game to watch! [birds chirping] (Olivia's mom) Now, we do have samples of all the cakes so you can taste the flavors. There's so many choices! (male) Daph, isn't that Steve Dalt from the newspaper? Oh! The Bayou Bengal Beignets! He can talk about Les Miles coming in and loving them. You read my mind. I just want it to be perfect. I know. Why don't you try some and see what you think? - Okay. - Alright. Chocolate marshmallow caramel. You got your classic white, you got red velvet, a little strawberry white, peanut butter chocolate. That's it. 1 don't know what everyone would like best. Well, don't over-think it. What matters is that it feels good and it tastes good. After all, in 20 years, all that matters is you and your groom, and the commitment you made to each other, right? Were you cool as a cucumber on your wedding day? Uh, well, I'm not married. Oh. (Olivia's mom) So, this one was a custom-made. They had asked for, yeah-- Olivia! Lucas! Your daddy was trying to make a good impression on that reporter. (Lucas) Sorry, Mom. Do you know where Olivia is? (Daphney) In the back, helping. (Lucas) The Redline D600, he got it. (Olivia) Who gave it to him? Anonymous gift. Mrs. Bell? Maybe that's why she's having us write the essays? Come on, Mrs. Bell's a teacher. She could never afford that bike. Don't you get it? It was our wish! Awesome bike, Ricky. Can't believe it! Canyou? (Lucas) Of course we believed it. We wished on the old Granville house for you and it came true! What's that? The house next to Olivia's. I thought that place was haunted. There was a glow in the house last night. 1 saw something. Not a ghost, more like an angel. Seriously. I'm gonna show my bike to everyone. 1 don't think we should mention to anybody else about the house, alright? They'll think we're crazy. Or they'll believe us. You really think Ricky's not gonna say anything? [window breaking] -I wish for a video game! -I wish for a girlfriend! (hopeful girl) 1 wish for a pony! (hopeful boy) { wish for a new NBA basketball! (hopeful girl) { wish for shoes! My impossible Christmas wish is for my grandma to spend Christmas with us this year. She has to have a nurse travel with her, but buying two tickets is expensive, so I guess Grandma can't come home. (Olivia) 1 wish that Carly Johnson could get a new kitty cat! (Lucas) 1 wish that Johnny Bell could fly like a bird! I wish that Adam Miggs could get a new truck for his dad! (Lucas) { wish that Brian Hitch could-- [dog barking] [laughing] Oh, my gosh. (Lucas) You think taking away the rocks will stop some people? At least seven kids from school came by yesterday. I just don't want to get in trouble. Well, more wishes are coming true. (Joey) Talking about your magic house again, Conroy? Well, the whole thing's a fat lie, ‘cause I went and I wished for a million dollars, and look at me. I'm still riding the bus to school. (Olivia) It's that guy again. Becker does have a point. Why do sometimes the wishes work and sometimes they don't? I don't know. Hey, hey, hey! Don't do that! You, don't do that! How'd you like it if people threw rocks at your house, you little knuckleheads? Kids. Oh my goodness, our quiet little neighborhood is turning into quite the circus. I'm sorry, Mom. (Olivia's mom) Sorry about what, sweetie? It isn't your fault, is it? Well, Ricky Sanchez got that bike and Jenny got the dog, so I kinda told some people. You told ‘em what? That that old house grants wishes? (Olivia) Well, yeah. You just shout up your wish and the angel hears you. Sweetheart, there's no angel. That's just some old house owned by some crotchety old landlord, doesn't take care of it. Sure, it was pretty romantic and beautiful in its day, but it's just an empty old house now. I saw something. Yeah? Well, maybe you did. (Olivia) And it's just a big coincidence about the bike and dog, Mom? (Olivia's mom) You know honey, I really don't know how to explain all that, but I gotta be honest. I think you have the wrong idea about angels. They're not genies that just grant wishes. They're messengers. In the Bible, whenever God's about to do something special, something out of the ordinary, the angels come and tell people not to afraid. Like the Christmas Story when the angel came to Mary? Yeah, exactly. But... What if, Mom? What if what, honey? What if God is about to do something really, really special? That's a good question, sweetie. [door closes] (male teacher) Hello? Someone there? You vandalize this house and I will call the police. (old woman) What are you doing here, child? You come here to rob me, break my windows? No, ma'am. Then what are you doing out here in the middle of the night? -I thought you were an angel. -An angel? Do I look like an angel to you? Maybe a little. Are you the reason these children have been coming around here throwing these rocks? Not entirely on purpose. I came here to have privacy. Please don't get me in trouble. Please don't tell that man that was here, either. He knows my teacher. Then you be on your way out of here. You're scaring an old soul. Go on, get! And she grabbed me on my shoulder and I freaked out. She was all covered in these white scarves. So, she's not an angel? No, I don't think so, although she did call herself an old soul instead of an old lady. Why would a mean old lady give a bike to Ricky? You know, all angels in the Bible aren't always playing harps. Some of them have swords made of fire. [making sword-fighting noises] I mean, it doesn't matter if she's an angel or not, right? Why are you so bummed about it? Well, some of us still have impossible Christmas wishes. That's all. (Olivia's mom) Excuse me! Are you the owner of this house? Yes, I am. (Olivia's mom) {t's a shame it's in such disrepair. You have to make it look like a crime scene, too? People are vandalizing my property. And this is the first you've noticed? Wow. Why don't you sell it to someone who'll take care of it? Make it beautiful again like it used to be, I'm sure. Yes, it was, but what I do with it is my business. You're right. Well, make sure you don't forget that chalked body outline there. Keep people away that way for sure. Do you have a better suggestion? You know... I don't think that anybody meant to cause you any trouble. Really, it's just kids that are excited about Christmas. You know kids. (male teacher) 1 don't have any kids. Well, maybe we can find a better way to keep people out and get your message across without all the "bah humbug." Well, if you can come up with an idea that works, then I'm all for it. - Deal, you got it. - Yeah. - What was your name? - My name's Melinda Mead. 1 live next door. - I'm Dr. Nathan Davis. - Dr. Nathan Davis. Alright, I'll be sure to remember that. (Nathan) Just call me Nathan. I'm used to saying the "doctor" part. Right. We'll see if we can come up with a friendlier sign, friendlier "Keep Out" sign. You take care. Yeah. So you finally met the crotchety old slumlord, huh? Yeah, but he wasn't any of those things. Alittle excessive, perhaps, but overall fine. A lot younger than I expected. Seemed pretty fuddy-duddy to me. (Melinda) Yeah, well, you weren't there. (Lucas) We saw him at school hugging Mrs. Bell. (Melinda) Really? How do you know it was the same guy? Um... We recognized his car. (Lucas) Maybe his wife and kids died and ghosts live there. Well, he said he didn't have any kids, Lucas. Maybe he did. My goodness, the two of you could make a mystery out of anything. How's it goin' over there? Almost done. Good, then you can get back to your reports and we'll hang this up after school tomorrow. (Mrs. Bell) Alright, let's continue with our oral reports, shall we? You know, I have to say, I have really enjoyed what you guys have been sharing. I hope you've learned a lot about each other. Olivia, you ready? My impossible Christmas wish is for a husband for my mom, Melinda Mead. She's not impossible to marry off or anything, she's just really busy taking care of me all the time. She works really hard at King Cakes, and then comes home and has to do all the work at home. It makes her pretty tired for anything else, plus she's gettin' kind of old, so most men her age are already married. [children laughing] The perfect husband for my mom would support her dream of going back to school for hospitality management. He would have to love kids like me, and he'd have to have a good job and a good sense of humor. But, most importantly, he'd have to put up with my mom's love of college football and her beloved LSU Tigers. [children laughing] The truth is, I think my mom is really special, but I think she'd hear it better from somebody who's not hoping for more allowance. So, that's my impossible Christmas wish. [children clapping] Seen anything? Alright, we are good to go. Who wants to make the first wish? Anybody, any takers, anybody? - You go first, Mom. - Me? You want me to go first? I'm gonna wish for a healthy baby for Daphney. I wish that I stop craving everything. (Olivia) Mr. Conroy, you should wish about that article in the paper about the beignets. - That's a good one. - Maybe I will. - Yeah, that's a good wish. - Slumlord's here. Alright. - How you doin'? - Hi. Good. What do you think? it's a lot better than that yellow caution tape, don't you think? - Yeah, it's much better. - Great. And I hope you don't mind about the lights. We saw that the power was still connected, so we-- - It looks really nice. - Good, good. And here's a special place for people to put their wishes, they still have the joy of making their wishes without all the insurance claims for you. (Nathan) Yeah. In fact, why don't you make the first wish? No, I don't have any wishes. I bet you're wishing for a delicious, home-cooked meal, aren'tyou? (Daphney's husband) Jeb Conroy. - Hey, Nathan. - My wife, Daphney. Pleasure. We see you eating at the deli downtown every night. Uh-oh. Yeah, but it's close by my office, so-- Well, I mean, they're nice in there, but the food is okay at best. Now, you come into King Cakes, we're gonna cook you an amazing meal. Chicken and sausage gumbo in a bread bow. (Melinda) Yeah, we're having a big pot of jambalaya tonight that, uh, well, you should come and join us, right? (Nathan) Tonight? No, no. I don't want to cause any trouble. -It's no trouble. - We'd love to have you. Come on, Doc. You watch college football? (Nathan) {do not. I don't have a lot of time for it. (Jeb) Big game tonight, gonna have the time of your life. It's nice of you to invite Nathan. Oh, stop. - Just saying. - There's nothing to it. He just seemed like he was alone. I'm thinkin" if we are hice to him, he'll keep fixing up the house. Well, if you're just thinking of the neighborhood. We can be nice to someone on Christmas without it seeming like a set-up. Come on, Daphney, you know me. Used to doing things on my own and I like it that way. Well, we wouldn't want any body to be alone on Christmas. (Nathan) Melinda certainly seems to have her opinions. That she does. It's good though. She has helped a lot of uncertain people make up their minds. Is she a counselor or something? In a way, yeah. She's our event and wedding coordinator at the shop. - What's her husband do? - Oh, no, she's not married. Not that we haven't tried. You really want opinions? Get her talking about LSU versus Alabama. Whoo! (Daphney) Who's hungry? (Melinda) Lucas, Olivia! Let's go. Alright my babies. Oh, we thank God for the food, if that's okay with you, Doc? Of course. (Jeb) Okay. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your many blessings. We also thank you for our new friend, Nathan. We ask your blessings on the food that we are about to receive, and also on those who made it. May we be mindful of those less fortunate tonight. And they all said-- [all] Amen. (Olivia) So Dr. Davis, how do you know Mrs. Bell? We saw you hugging her after school. (Melinda) Olivia! (Nathan) It's okay. Mrs. Bell is my sister. (Melinda) Oh, that's very nice. Did not know that. (Daphney) So, do you have any other family in town? No, just her. Well, the kids enjoyed your sister, Mrs. Bell's class this year, didn't you? She should give less homework, though. Well, as long as we're asking nosey questions, Nathan, how did you come to own the old Granville house? That's what we call it. I used to live there. My wife and I lived there, but then she left, and then did too. I would have expected that the old neighbors would have told you this. No, no one's mentioned that that I know of. Daphney, has anyone ever mentioned that to you? (Daphney) Nope, absolutely not. (Melinda) Didn't know anything like that. Oh, you know, it's really nice of you to invite me over here, but!'m so sorry, 1 have a patient emergency. I'm gonna have to leave. Of course, it's no problem. (Nathan) It was nice meeting you. (Melinda) We understand, don't we? I'll walk you to the door. Thank you, alright. You know; the house hasn't looked that good in a long time, so thanks. Well, good. - Have a good night. - Thanks. That wasn't a patient emergency. Olivia— Touchy subject? Well, you know, I really don't think it's any of our business, so let's eat. (Olivia) Come on. (Olivia) Come on. It's empty! Your wish is already coming true. The way your mom asked the doctor over. No way, not him. Why not? ‘Cause, he's not who I picked. He's a doctor. I thought girls liked that. [female humming] (Olivia) Shh. Listen. [humming] Hello! Is somebody there? What did I do? Just come with me. Looks like you have a friend outside. [door opening] Hi, Dr. Davis. You know, it's really okay to call me Nathan. Oh, "kay. Can I get you something? Yeah, Jeb told me that you had better gumbo here than at the deli by my office. Yeah, that's absolutely true, we do! (Nathan) You know, look, I really wanted to say that i'm sorry for leaving so abruptly last night. It was rude, I know. It's alright, you have patients. We understood. I didn't get a patient call. 1 just don't let people into my life, and I was uncomfortable. Not because of any of you. I mean, you and your friends were all really nice. 1 just--I'm just used to doing things on my own, and I like it that way, or at least I thought. You know, you all gave me a glimpse into what I've been missing. Well, what about your sister and her family? (Nathan) Well, you know, I see them, but you know, it's different. They have their own things to worry about and-- Look, I just really wanted to apologize to all of you. Okay, apology accepted. And maybe you can try again some other time. 1 would like to. Thanks. Friday. I'm s orry ? We could, you know, try to do it again on Friday. You know, if you're free then! could pick you up. Pick me up for what? Well, I don't want to invite myself over, but I don't cook, so we would have to go somewhere. Oh... Oh, oh. Well, all of us? Should I invite the Conroys? Maybe we could keep it small? I'm better one-on-one usually. Yeah, sure. I could do that. Great. Great. I'll pick you up at 6? Pick me up at 6. ‘Kay. Okay. Guess he really didn't want the gumbo. - You're going, right? -Oh my. [laughing] [crickets chirping] - It's a date. -No, no. That's not the way it seemed at the time. But, I thought you were in favor of that anyway. Yeah, well, he's not who I had in mind, so-- Well, I said yes and I'm not backing out now. Maybe he'll get sick or something. (Melinda) Oh my goodness. How did your oral report go today? You didn't tell me. - Good. -Yeah? - Yeah, really good. - Good. What'd you wish for? Show. I wished that we'd have snow for Christmas this year. [laughing] Snow! Good thing you wished for the impossible. Any other wishes come true today? I don't know. It was only Joey Becker's report today, and he wished for a million dollars. (Melinda) Oh my goodness, 1 don't see an angel bringing that to him anytime soon, do you? Nah, and I don't think that was his real wish anyway. No? If you were Joey Becker, what would you wish for? For my dad to stop drinking. Oh my, I had no idea. I think that's why Joey Becker acts like such a jerk all the time. (Melinda) Well, that sounds like something for good night prayers, huh? Dear God, thanks for today and all the wishes that are coming true. Please help Joey's family, and please help his dad to stop drinking, and maybe we'll see them at church sometime. Please help us have a good night's sleep. [together] Amen. Yeah, well, you never know. Dr. Davis might be a drunk too. [laughing] You're so funny. Good night, baby. I love you. I love you, too. - See you tomorrow. - See ya. (Olivia) So you haven't heard of anybody getting any wish answered? Only yours. Dr. Davis asking my mom out is not the answer to my wish. We probably broke the rules by putting up the mailbox. I'm telling you, it's all about throwing the rocks. [whistle blowing] Mrs. Bell's class. Do you think he's a PE. Coach? 1 don't think so. Alright, everybody circle up. I'm Mr. Brennan, and I usually sub over at the high school and the middle school, but Mrs. Bell had to leave unexpectedly, so I get the pleasure of revisiting the fifth grade for the next couple of days. [children cheering] Wait a minute, not so fast. You don't even know me. I could be your worst nightmare, right? Is Mrs. Bell sick? Mrs. Bell is not sick, but she did have to leave, so for now, we're gonna have some fun with geographic regions of North America! [sarcastically] Yay. On Friday afternoon, she has us do oral reports. Well, Mrs. Bell wants to grade those herself, so some of you may have to wait until after Christmas. She's gonna be gone until Christmas break? It's possible, but let's all hope that you're rid of me by then, because all the teaching and grading papers and stuff totally interferes with my college football watchin' schedule. Alright, pilgrims, head ‘em up, move ‘em out! (Olivia) So, Mr. Brennan had us label all the states, the capitals, and color which states were in the Big Ten, ACC, Pac 10. -SEC? - Of course. I was pretty good at it though, thanks to you. And they say that public education's in decline. He was so funny, Mom. He made all the spelling words into a game and we were laughing so hard. You'd really like him. Am I too dressed up? I'm too dressed up, aren't 1? Yeah, the shoes. The shoes? The shoes. (Olivia) You don't want to look like you're trying to impress him. Yeah, I shouldn't wear heels. I shouldn't wear heels. I should wear flats. Perfect. Yeah, not too impressive. Well, thank you. Do you have to go? Yes, honey, I do. (Olivia) But! told Lucas {'d be over at 6:30. Well, great. Have a great time. Itis 6:30. Okay. I feel a lecture about men coming. I'm too hungry. Well, why don't we both agree now that Dr. Davis is not the man for you. I never said he was, honey, and it's not really even a date. More for him, really. There's one thing I was never gonna do in my life was put you through a bunch of failed dating relationships ‘cause we're just fine on our own. Okay, I'm gonna put that in-- Mom, I really don't want jelly. It's okay. You're right, honey, because you know, ‘cause peanut butter is just fine all on its own, isn't it? Look at that, easy. [knocking] Hello? I'm not gonna go until you answer the door. I know you're there, ‘cause you never go anywhere else. [knocking] I need some answers. I'm not gonna leave until I get them. [knocking] Lord have mercy, child. You're gonna wake up your whole neighborhood. Canl come in? No. Well, can you come out? No. How else are we gonna talk then? I came here for privacy, not a conversation. Do you know where Dr. Davis is tonight? 1 know he visits you a lot ‘cause he owns this place. I need to know where he is. Come on. (old woman) Come on, you don't want to sit in that dusty old room. Don't touch that please. Sit down. So, you only live in the back? How come you don't want people to know that you live here? That's my business. So, what is this about Dr. Davis? (Olivia) Well, how do you know him? (old woman) We go back a ways. I knew his parents. Do you know where he is tonight? Nathan had some business that took him out of town. That's all I know. Are you a patient of his or something? Or something. I'm not an angel if that's what you're still worried about. No, ma'am. { think that seems pretty obvious, but you are collecting the wishes from the box. Well, if we left them in there, people would stop believing, wouldn't they? True... But then you'd have your privacy, and I thought that's what you wanted. You never saw any kid happier than Ricky Sanchez on that bike, but I just can't figure out how you got it to him. It was like magic. Expedite shipping. It's free for the holidays. What? (old woman) Well, I may be an old lady, but { know how to use the Internet and a credit card. Boy, do I know how to use that credit card. How did you know where to send it? (old woman) You and your friend were as loud as a herd of elephants along my fence. I heard you talking about the foster parents. {can put two and two together. Yes ma'am. (old woman) This has got to be our little secret. I don't want people thinking I'll give a gift to anyone who wants one. Of course not. What is your name, child? Olivia Mead. What's yours? Elsie Waybright. Did you need Nathan for some reason? Nothing medical. He was supposed to take my mom out to dinner tonight, but he stood her up. Oh, I'm sure he intended to call. Well, I'm sorry for bugging you. I just really wanted to know. I'm glad you got Ricky Sanchez that bike, and those other kids. They really deserved it. (Elsie) You know how I knew they deserved them? How? You wished those wishes for them. They didn't wish it for themselves. You know, I do know a lot of people here. So, in case you need any help delivering things or finding out any information, I can help you sort the wishes out. Well, what makes you think I intend to deliver any more wishes? Well, if you didn't, you'd throw the wishes away, but instead, you have them all sorted out. I wouldn't tell anybody it was from you. Come back after dinner tomorrow, and tell your mother where you're going because if she catches you out of the bed, there'll be no Christmas foryou atall. Yes ma'am. Good night. "A husband for my mom." [christmas music] [christmas music] PAY (Lucas) Is your mom mad about last night? What do you mean? Getting stood up, what else would I mean? I snuck over to the house last night. I had a meeting with the angel. I mean, her real name's Elsie Way bright and she's no angel, believe me. Did she give Ricky that bike? I couldn't say. You don't know, or you just don't want to tell me? I tell you everything, right? Who is she, and why would she want to live in that dark, dumpy place anyway? Let's find out. Elsie Waybright. Elsie's a nickname. Elizabeth? Elsa? (Olivia) "Did you mean Elsa Way?" Do "Images." Okay. (Lucas) Whoa! That's her! I mean, she's a lot older now, but that's her. She's totally famous. “Jazz and Gospel superstar Elsa Way has cancelled "her farewell concert at the New York Jazz Festival. "Singer cites personal issues that take precedence. Way was also to be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award." When was this? June. Something really big must have happened for her not to go and get her award. Why would a famous person ever want to live here? Privacy. [knocking] Miss Elsie? Hello? Miss Elsie, you should really take down those newspapers so you know it's me. (Elsie) These are the wishes from the angel box so far. I categorized them. "God," "Possible," "Stupid." Stupid? Look. Does it have to be so dark in here? I can't read them very well. Yes, it does. Alright. "I wish for a teacher who would never give us homework or tests." "I wish I was bigger than Chris Higby so I could beat him up." It's not gonna happen, even if it could. "Dear Angel, please give me a million dollars and a mansion with gold-plated toilets." Stu-pid. The middle basket we can separate as tasks, but I'm particularly interested in those who are not just asking for a present but these require a little research. Can I look at those? "I wish my dad could find a job and get sober." I know who that one is. I've been praying a lot on that one. "Dear God, please bring me home this Christmas. I'm all alone and I miss my wife so much." That's sad. You put mine in the God pile? It's not that hard! I'm sure we can do something about a lot of those. We're not gonna take that poor, sad man to heaven. No, but we can make some of them come true. Baby, some things only God can do, only God knows how to help. So, let's just concentrate on this middle basket. (Olivia) My wish isn't that impossible. It's kind of weird that you're reading all the wishes. Do you understand the people's handwriting? Why? Did you put one in? That guy's everywhere. (Olivia) Except in my house on Friday night. Wait, no, don't yell at him. Why would 1? It's not him who I wanted to come anyway. Olivia? Are you hiding? We're just late for school. My sister was making baby blankets for the church. She asked me to drop them off for her. I'm glad you have time to keep your promises for others. Tell Mrs. Bell hope she's feeling better. (Olivia) We have to figure out a way for them to meet. I'm sure they'll hit it off. Ask Mr. Brennan to come to the shop. But what if he comes while my mom's not working or your mom helps him instead of mine? There has to be a more certain way that they'll talk. I don't know, Olivia. We've been talking about this all day. Romance isn't really my superpower, so I think I'm just gonna go play soccer. (Joey) You can't play soccer, Lucas. That's my ball. No, it's the school's ball. And I rule the school. Olivia! - Hey! -owl [whistle blowing] (Mr. Brennan) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Break it up. That's enough. I guess you're gonna have to call my mom in and talk to her about this. I don't know if it requires that. { haven't been here very long, but I'm guessing that was a rare occurrence for you? Well, my mom likes to know things that's going on with me at school, and she likes to hear it firsthand. Well, I'm sure the principal would be glad to talk to her about it if it comes to that, but it won't happen again, will it? Look, I know Joey's a problem and I'll keep my eye on him, but you let a teacher handle it, okay? Alright, you can go now. Right. Oh, my mom works at King Cakes. Have you ever been there? King Cakes, yeah, you know, 1 think I've heard of it. You should come by sometime and try our gingerbread cookies we have for Christmas. It's delicious. Great bread pudding, too. Alright. Thank you. [laughing timidly] You know, that was so obvious. I was just making suggestions and helping Christmas wishes come true. Yeah, your own. For my mom. I don't remember her wishing for that or him either. Well, you should wish for Joey Becker to stop picking on you. Well, I did, but you had to jump in and now I look stupid ‘cause a girl's fighting my battles. Lucas, I have important stuff to do today. Olivia! I think this is a good time to give you some wise advice from my dad. Lucas, let go of me. "Do not get up in the business of dragons, for you are crunchy and good with ketchup." I'm just gonna go say hello. Hi, Mr. Becker. Who are you? I just wanted to let you know that they're hiring at Haussman Construction. Of course, you'd have to clean up a bit, and you know, stop drinking. Who do you think you are? Just a friend. Stay out of my business. Ready to go, Dad? Son, you think I'm a drunk? You wish was a different person or work for some construction company? Dad, just leave her alone. She didn't mean anything by it. Get in. Olivia, some things are just impossible. [crickets chirping] [knocking] - Hi. - Hi. Maybe we got our days mixed up. I realized you didn't get my message. No, I did not. What message would that be? You know, I guess I'm gonna be constantly apologizing to you. 1 asked my office to leave word at your shop Friday. I had to take my sister to the children's hospital in Jackson. Oh. Olivia did mention that Mrs. Bell wasn't there. Yeah. Would you like to come in? (Nathan) Yeah, sure. (Melinda) So, is everything okay? Well, not really, but there wasn't much more that I could do there so she sent me back home to take care of a few things here. You said the children's hospital, what-- Yeah, it's my niece, Hannah. She needs a kidney. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Oh, thanks. Well, would you like to sit down? - Sure, thank you. - Yeah. (Melinda) Well, did she get it? No, it wasn't a match. No? I'm sorry. But they want her to stay close so, you know, she can be there quickly when they do find one. But that means that, you know, they have to find an apartment there. Yeah, you must be very worried. Yeah. Well, it's—you know, this isn't my specialty, but when you're in medicine you know too much sometimes. Canl get you a coffee or tea or Sure, tea if you're offering. (Melinda) Yeah, absolutely. Excuse me? You know the day that I came to your shop to tell you that I didn't get that patient call, I went back home to watch the LSU game. Did you? (Nathan) Yes, and you know, 1 don't get a chance to watch that much football, but! was just wondering, you know, what you thought of the game? [laughing] Here's a new one. "Hannah Bell needs a kidney." How do you know that? My mom had a visitor tonight. There's this perfect place for eavesdropping between the couch and the wall if you're really quiet. I knew that's where you'd put it. That's why I reworded it. “Mrs. Bell needs money so that she could live close to the children's hospital." What can we do? Well, I'm sure she needs more than I've got, what with all the Christmas wishes we've been granting. How do you have money to buy all these presents? Is that rude to ask? Well, there's nobody to buy for but myself, and at my age, all the fun's gone out of that. Did you make it all from your singing? I know how to use the Internet too, but I'd rather get it from the real source. You can't believe everything you read on Wikipedia. Well, that was a long time ago. Well, yeah, but just this year you were supposed to sing a concert and get an award. How come you didn't go? You are a very nosey little girl. You're supposed to know things about your friends. Lucas, yeah, he's my best friend, and we know everything about each other. Are we friends now? Partners at least, but I like "friends." 1 like "friends" too. Come on, you want to see the source. (Melinda) Well, this is kind of a small area for a specialist to be practicing in, isn't it? Well, I don't know. Ear, nose, throat gets lots of business anywhere. Really? Yeah, there's a lot of ear-related symptoms and vertigo, some cancers, adenoids, tonsils, chronic sinusitis. All very exciting stuff, as you can see, But it's way more exciting than planning parties. Oh, you think so? Oh, really? Well, this is kind of a small area to, you know, survive on planning weddings. We make baked goods for funerals. We don't discriminate. They need to eat, as well. Not our dearly departed, but-that's not right. You're much funnier than you seemed the day that I met you with the caution tape. That was not particularly funny. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - For the sense of humor part. - You're welcome. 1 think that was a compliment. - For you, as well. - Really, me? Yeah, I thought the tape was funny. You thought it was funny? That's why you were putting it up? Well, afterwards. (Melinda) You know, I don't know what happened inside that old house and you certainly don't have to tell me, but I'm awfully sorry that it did. I've been sorry about it for a long time, so maybe it's time I stopped. (Elsie) Give me one of those candles, baby. Oh, alright. Here you go. Thank you. Is this your room up here? I saw it glowing from my house. Dr. Davis said that this was his house. It was. Whoa! What are these? (Elsie) Records. Music. I've heard of them. Miss Elsie! You were a diva! Pictures weren't half of it. Well, you look so beautiful. On the outside. Is this you? You were cute. No, that's my Maliyah. You have a daughter? Somewhere I do. You don't know where she is? (Elsie) She wants it that way. I wasn't always an angel, baby. I'm known for saying some very hateful words. 1 raised my hands a time or two. I drove away three husbands and a daughter. So, you're trying to make up for all that? (Elsie) Well, when you get older, you realize your chances are passing you by and you have to use the chances God gives you. Miss Elsie? Are you dying? We're all dying, baby. Some of us faster than others. But no, not the way you mean. Any more questions? Or can we get back to the business? Why do you wear so much white, even in these pictures? Well, when I was a bitty girl, my mother didn't have a very good washing machine and she would never let me wear white. But when I got some money, I bought white and I wore it all the time. Anything else? Not at the moment, but I'll probably think of some. I'm sure you will. I've answered your questions. Will you answer my question? Where is your father, baby? And why would you ask for a husband for your mother and not a father for yourself? I don't need a father. My mom's told me that ever since I was born, says I'm very self-sufficient. Well, sometimes we think we are, but it's never true, and don't be frightened by that either. One of my favorite verses says, "My grace is sufficient for you because my power is made perfect in weakness." You see, when we admit that we're weak, that gives God a chance to show us that he's strong. Sounds like an excuse to do nothing. (Elsie) Well, we do the best we can, and then we've got to be humble enough to admit that we need him, and then we put things in the God basket. So why don't you try to keep in touch with Maliyah? That would take a miracle. There was a Christmas carol that she used to love when she was about your age. I put it in one of those records in there somewhere. Sing it. I don't sing. My voice is not what it used to be. Please? (Elsie singing) I It came upon a midnight clear I ♪ That glorious song of old ♪ I With angels bending near the earth; ♪ To touch their harps of gold ♪ I Peace on the earth, goodwill to men} ♪ From heaven's all-gracious King ♪ ♪ The world in solemn stillness lay ♪ ♪ To hear the angels sing J ♪ Miss Elsie, you sure sing like an angel. You go on home to your mother. We'll have more wishes tomorrow. What about a fundraiser for Mrs. Bell? I'm no good at a bake sale. No, it's a benefit concert. You could sing. I don't sing anymore. But you just did, and it was beautiful. This is not about me. I can't be singing in public anymore. Nobody knows who I am anymore anyway. Miss Elsie, they should. Good night. [door shutting] It's like your dad is doing with the Bayou Bengal Beignets, trying to get Les Miles to do a celebrity endorsement. That gets everyone excited. Why are you making flyers? She said she wouldn't do it. I'm helping her catch the vision. She thinks that nobody remembers her, but maybe we could show her that people still love her. That way she won't be afraid to come out and sing. So, you got the church's pemission on Christmas Eve? They were already doing a Christmas program, so they're adding this. They wanted to do it. Lucas, why are you being such a Scrooge about this? Are you jealous or something? Jealous of what? That you have a new best friend? That you suddenly know what's best for everybody? If you haven't noticed, Olivia, none of it's working. It is working. (Melinda) Hey there, what can I do for ya? (Mr. Brennan) Hey, I was just out jogging and I remembered that this place has amazing gingerbread. We sure do. Best gingerbread in town. Hi, Mr. Brennan! This is my mom. - Hey, kid. -Yes, I'm her mom, Melinda. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, is this your place? No, no, Lucas' parents, the Conroys do. I'm the catering coordinator. Oh, that's why your name sounded so familiar. You know, with all the craziness, it's hard to keep everything straight. Oh, what craziness would that be? Well, you're working with my fiancée, Becca Holloway, on our wedding. (Melinda) Oh my gosh, that's right! Yes, Beccal We know Becca! Sweet girl, we love her. Yeah, yeah, well, she's into the food, and the cakes, and stuff. 1 just told her I want a "Go Tigers!" groom's cake, but otherwise, I really don't care. Oh, well, you know, you really should, ‘cause she's having a hard time making decisions. Really? Huh, I didn't realize that. Well, why don't you give me two gingerbread cookies and I'll take one to her. A peace offering. Coming up, two gingerbread men. What a small world, isn't it, that he should, yeah, huh? That's funny. Alright, there you go. That's $3. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Mrs. Mead, you have a terrific daughter. Oh, thank you. She's a real angel, isn't she? Thanks so much. See yal! (Melinda) Alright, take care. He was nice, right? Positively engaging. Be right back, Mom. You're the guy, right? The reporter that everybody's been asking to write about the Bengal Beignets? Every time I come here. Look, I already told them, beignets aren't a story. So a coach likes to eat donuts. Short notice. I'm still confirming talent, but I thought you could help get the word out. (Steve Dalt) You got Elsa Way coming to perform at your benefit concert on Christmas Eve? She's been M.I.A. since last summer. She lives here now, in the old wishing house on my street. [scoffs] It's true! Thanks anyway, kid. Don't ask me about the beignets again, alright? Miss Way? Are you alright in there? Hello? Alright, I'm coming in. Hey! Wait! Miss Way? Hello? Miss Way, are you alright? (Olivia) Stop! What are you doing? I come to check out your story. Not about this! It's none of your business. Did you see the glass? It's broken. Maybe she's hurt. She's not hurt. Miss Elsie! Miss Elsie, wake up! Please, please. Please wake up. Close that back, child. Who are you chasing that little girl? Nobody invited you here, getout. Out! Get out right now! (Steve Dalt) Are you the one answering all the angel wishes? You did this? You brought a reporter into my house when I trusted you? -No- - You told him. I didn't bring him. 1 didn't know he was gonna come here. I just wanted you to know how much people remember you. (Elsie) Well, you go out with him. You go out right now. - No, Miss Elsie. - Go. Go how. - Please. - Go right now. (Steve Dalt) Hey Bill... Remember when you said they'd give me a shot at the city desk over there if I found the next big story to break? I got it. Yeah. (Nathan) First of all, she's not dying. -I didn't say that. - Let him finish, please. (Nathan) 1 asked her permission to tell you what's going on with her so you can fully understand what you did. She has throat cancer. Now, I helped research and develop a new blue light system of PDT awhile back, and we're using it to treat her. What is that? (Nathan) Oh, it's photodynamic therapy. Photosensitive drugs are absorbed by cancer cells and then a special light kills them. The blue light. (Nathan) Yes, but it makes her sensitive to regular light for a few weeks. That explains why she was always in the dark. (Nathan) When you pulled open the curtains, you put her at risk. Is she okay? (Nathan) We're doing some tests, but it seems so. Now, whether she's emotionally okay is another thing. I just wanted her to sing for Mrs. Bell. She sings so beautifully. You heard Elsie sing? Well, how did she sound? Maybe a little raspy at first, but I thought it was because she was singing a song that she sang for Maliyah. (Melinda) Well, listen, there is going to be some form of punishment to start with. Alright, young lady? Isn't there something I can do to say sorry to her? Maybe we can get her and her daughter together for Christmas. (Melinda) Sweetheart, you overstepping into people's personal lives is exactly what got you into this trouble in the first place. You're lucky it was Miss Elsie. Going into a stranger's house at night without telling your mother— Why don't you go on upstairs? I'll be up in a minute so we can discuss consequences. Go. I'm so sorry, Miss Elsie. I'm sorry if I overstepped anything myself. - Stop. - Okay, I'm sorry. No, stop apologizing. { should be the one apologizing. It was deserved. I should have known what Olivia was doing. I should have known about Elsie. Well, she's a kid. She's gonna hide things. It's I have tried to teach her that she is smart, that she is capable, that she's self-sufficient, that she doesn't need anybody, because I've never wanted her to be embarrassed or feel lacking because she only has me and she doesn't have— I'm so sorry. I have no idea why I just did that. Well, I know why I did it, but it was completely inappropriate. I'm-- I'm sorry. Maybe just next time, give me some warning. I'll be better prepared. Okay. Next time. Don't be so hard on Olivia. I mean, she did get Elsie to sing, and she hasn't done that in a long time. ‘Kay. Good night. Good night. Okay. [crickets chirping] Are you here to talk about my punishment? I'm still thinking about that, honey. Why didn't you tell me about Elsie? I just-4 didn't want you to tell me to stop. Mom, I ruined everything. Miss Elsie's angry now, and she's never gonna come out of the house, and the wishes are over. Lucas isn't speaking to me now. Lucas will come around, I'm sure. And I wished for you to have a husband, but I messed up that, too. Miss Elsie said that some wishes were for the God basket and that we were too weak, and those were the times that God had to be strong. But I tried to do them anyway. I'm so sorry, Mom. I know you are, baby. I know you are. I should try to fix it. Olivia, honey— The right way. My sweet girl. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. 1 didn't realize that anybody else was in here. What do you have there? All the Christmas wishes I can remember from the God basket. Elsie wanted me to pray for them, which I never really did at first. May 1? Did she wish for this one about finding Maliyah? I added that, but I'm not overstepping. I figured I can ask God anything, and he can always say no if he wants to. I'm here figuring the same thing. I'm sorry, Dr. Davis. Elsie's gonna be okay. She's a strong lady. And I'm sorry that I said bad things to my mom about you, and I prayed against you, too. Why would you do that? I had somebody else in mind, and I thought you hated kids. But then I saw the nursery in your house, and I thought it was really, really sweet. Well, we had really wanted a baby, but I can't have children. Why didn't you just adopt? My ex-wife wanted her own children more than she wanted me, apparently. She married someone else? They have three kids now. I'm gonna put kids for you on the list, if you want me to. That's a tall order. It's definitely for the God basket. Maybe I should start with a wife, you know, before the kids. I'd rather do it in that order. You know, some wives already come with kids. It's kind of like a pre-packaged deal. Yes, itis. Not all of them are perfect, though. Well, neither am I. Well, I better get to it. Olivia, the pastor's gonna have a special offering on Christmas Eve for Hannah. Maybe you can encourage people to come. It really meant a lot to my sister when I told her what you were planning. I can get a lot of people to come there. Really? I mean, not on my own. With an adult's help. Okay. Let's pray together for your list. Sure. 1 think if we start by thanking him for dying to forgive our sins, compared to that, none of this will seem so impossible. You could still come, you know. You wouldn't have to sing. It'll be dark enough, and I think the press interest has died down, being that it's Christmas Eve. When I decided to move here, you promised me absolute privacy. (Nathan) Well, that was before you decided to buy a foster kid a very expensive bike. Elsie, whoever you were before, you're not that person anymore. You don't have to punish yourself or try to be strong all on your own. Did Olivia send you up here to tell me that? No. No, but thanks to the both of you, a lot of people have gotten a second chance for Christmas this year, including me. Thank you. Ready?
