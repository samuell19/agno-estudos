(Multicom Jingle) (horn blowing) (piano music) (chattering) (car doors banging) - Oh, hello sunshine. - Bradley. - Mr. Townsend asked that we pay you a visit. - No. No. (crying out) - That's enough, you sadistic bastard. Go and get the camera. (gun firing) (shutter clicking) That's another one for Mr. Townsend collection, eh? Stay. (upbeat rock music) - David, when it comes to deals, always remember where the finance comes from, including your own. Got the passports? We should be landing soon. - Good. - Hmm, interesting. - Actually, he's one of the photographers that we were discussing. - Out of the window now. Other way. That's perfect, that's good. Now with your tongue out, lick your lips. Lick you lips, that's it. Come on, put some more sex into it. Come on, you're supposed to be a Victorian hooker. - Oh. (shutter clicking) - Alright, that's one for me. Now about the shoots for Vogue huh? (dramatic music) - [Woman] Coffee? - Mmhmm. Like the stuff? - Smashing. I think she's smiling too much in this one though. By the way we had an interesting phone call this morning. - I hope it was obscene. - No, it was from the office of Howard Townsend. You know, the shipping tycoon. - What does he want? Snaps of his latest super tanker? - He wanted to discuss an assignment. He's left a number here for me to ring him back and arrange a time. - Might be interesting. - Let's ring him now and fix it. - Oh give me a minute. - No, now. (phone whirring) (dramatic music) - My name's James Compton, Mr. Townsend's expecting me. - Yes sir, would you drive straight through, park your car and someone will meet you at the front door. - Jesus. (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) - Mr. Compton do come in. - Thank you. (dramatic music) (door bangs) (clicking) - One moment sir. I shall inform Mr. Townsend's secretary that you are here. (clicking) Mr. Compton is here. (clicking) Shan't be long sir, please take a seat. (clicking) (dramatic music) - [Howard] Jacob if that shipment is not in Beirut by next Thursday I'll personally hand you over to the-- - Mr. Compton? - Mmhmm. - This way please, Mr. Townsend will see you now. (clicking) (dramatic music) - [Howard] Mr. Compton it's my pleasure. - Pleased to meet you. - I've been looking forward to meeting you for some time. Sit down, drink? - Ah, no thanks, to early for me. - [Howard] Would you mind if I do? - Not at all. - You know photography is an interest of mine, I've been following it's rise as an art form for many years now. Recently I saw your latest book. I must say I was, I was very impressed. - Thank you. - You have a special talent for photographing beautiful women. Which brings me to why I asked you here. - Yes, I was intrigued. - I have a special friend named Simone, I want some photos of her like the ones in your book. Actually I checked with a number of photographers but your work has impressed me the most, it your individuality I suppose. Are you interested? - Could be. I'll have to see the subject first. - Of course. Simone, will you come in here please? I don't think you'll be disappointed. I know that you're very expensive but fortunately I'm a wealthy man. I'll pay double your normal rates, just send an invoice when you're through. (door clicks) Ah, Simone. I want you to meet James Compton. He's gonna take some photographs of you, or at least we hope he will. - How do you do Mr. Compton? - Hello. I've seen photos of you before, somewhere. - You've got a good memory. I did do some modeling, sometime ago but I didn't stay at it long. - [James] You shoulda. You've got nice presence. - Well, maybe I could start doing some housewife ads. - Ah you can't be that old. - (scoffs) You'd be surprised. - Alright Simone that'll be enough. You can go now. - My, that was quick. Goodbye Mr. Compton. - Goodbye. (clicking) - This Beirut deal has really gone to his head. Now he's talking about wanting to finance a revolution in Africa. - Yeah, he's had that idea for years. Just the thought of it makes him feel good. - Well, I'm on to something that just might bring him back down to earth. I have to check a few things first but I just may possibly have something. Ever hear of a photographer called James Compton? (dramatic chord) - Well my dear, Mr. Compton has agreed to photograph you. I suggest you make your own arrangements regarding appointments. - Well do I go to his studio or does he come here? - Well not here, you know I don't allow other people on these premises. No, make arrangements to use Compton's studio. Charles will take you and pick you up afterwards. - As you wish Howard. - I've always admired beauty and envied those who can capture it in some way. All Mr. Compton has to do is to capture what already exists. (phone ringing) Hello. Hold on a moment. Why don't you call Compton's studio, make arrangements for the first session? What is it? How do they know? Now listen only three people knew that we were selling to both sides yourself, myself and... David, that double crossing bastard. I'll handle it. (phone clatters) Get me an outside line. (clattering) (dramatic music) (door bell ringing) - Hello, you must be Miss-- - Simone. - I'm Rhoda James's secretary. Come on in. - Oh thank you Charles, I'll see you at seven. - Thank you. - This way. Excuse the mess, we've been working overtime. Well here's the master. - Hello. How are you? - Fine but a bit nervous. - [James] Ah you'll be alright. - Excuse me James I'll just go and get those prints. - [James] Fine. Here let me take your bag. - Oh, thank you. - Well, make yourself at home. Coffee? - Oh yes please. - Milk and sugar? - Milk and no sugar. (gentle music) Thank you. Does that really sail? - Yes every Sunday. Right, now I'm gonna go slow today and give you time to warm up in front of the camera and give me a chance to see you in a variety of costumes. - Yes I am feeling a bit tense. It seems ages since I've done this sort of thing. - Alright, take your time, I'll be ready when you are. - Oh thank you. (dramatic music) - Okay, here we go. Right, sit up a bit, that's it, that's it. Turn to your left. Um, good. (camera clicking) Right, fingers through your hair. - Like this? - Mmhmm. (camera clicking) You mentioned that you modeled before. - Oh yes I did but when I was very much younger. - [James] Tell me about it. - Well, my father died when I was 17 and the family split up and I had to get a job. Modeling seemed the obvious answer. It was quite fun at first, all the bright lights and everything and then it became quite unpleasant. I started having awful rows with my agent about the pettiest things. - [James] Oh it's not always like that. - No I know it's not but it seemed like it at the time. Anyway my photographs were turning up in the strangest places in obscure magazines in America and all over the place and I wasn't being paid for them so, well I decided to get out. - Okay no more chatter, now turn to your right. That's it, let's have a profile, chin down. (camera clicking) Good, now onto me. (camera clicking) Fine that's enough sophistication let's have a smile now. Come on, come on, come on, come on, that's it. (camera clicking) (dramatic music) - Well I'm packing my things now. Look-- (thuds) Just a minute. That's okay. I tell you the plans perfect. Now we really have him by the balls. Look um, I'll meet you at eight o'clock and we can discuss it in detail okay? - [Man] Mind the roads won't you sunshine? I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. (laughs) (suspenseful music) (crying out) (whacking) (crying out) (screaming) (dramatic music) (ominous chord) - Well I like this one, this one with the umbrella and this one I think. - Oh I think I look silly in that. - No I think it's got something even if you don't think so. Anyway I've got some ideas how we can develop these into something for another time. - And talking of time, what time is it? - Ah, 6:45. - I've gotta go. - Can I give you a lift? - No thank you, it's not allowed. It's the house rules that the chauffeur takes me back. - Okay but on Wednesday we go to the south coast in my car okay? I want some shots by the ocean. - Alright. (dramatic music) - Oh, not bad for an amateur. - She's quite good. She has a certain quality of hidden vulnerability that photographs very well. - What's she doing with someone like Townsend? (camera clicking) - That's a good one. That's it, take it easy, relax. (camera clicking) That's it. (camera clicking) Good one. That's it, that's perfect. That's a good one. (camera clicking) Okay, relax a bit now. - I'm sorry I just feel so awkward. It's all those people up there, they bother me. - [James] One of the hazards of the profession. - I just feel so self conscious. - Okay, let's go further up there possibly we'll find some seclusion there. (gentle music) (chattering) (dramatic music) - You used to work in New York didn't you? - That's right. - Well what made you stay in London? - Oh I guess I was in love with the Queen or something. No it's just that the states was getting just to commercial. - So you're around to capitalism? - Oh no not at all. After all I'm an independent business man myself. It's just that there, there are limits. And you, how did you get mixed up with Townsend? Doesn't seem your type. - Oh, well I first met Howard about three years ago. It was on a flight to the Middle East he was a passenger and I was the air hostess. - Ah love at first sight. - No, not at all. We started going out and one thing led to another. - And? - [Simone] And we now have a very convenient relationship. It was a contract really. - Oh. - Well look I'm his girlfriend alright? His mistress. I have been for three years and I've been very well and he's not too demanding. I mean, when it's all over as it inevitably will be I should be financially stable for life. We're very happy like that, I'm mean, I'm not his first mistress and I'd be silly to think I'm going to be his last. - Aside from collecting beautiful women what else does Townsend do? - I don't know really, it's none of my concern. - Oh it seems a bit suspect if you ask me. - Well look, a man in his position can't be completely clean you know that. Anyway Howard has tremendous style, that's what I like about him. So I just try and ignore the other side of his life. - [James] Good thinking. (clicking) - Hi. - Hi. - How are things going with Miss Simone? - Oh she's okay. - I bet. (phone ringing) Compton Studios good morning. - Rhoda my dear how are you? - Oh hello Mr. Patterson I'm fine thank you. We haven't seen you for a long time. - Been up to me eyes in it lately old girl. Is the dear boy around? - Yes he is, hold on a minute I'll just get him. It's Ian Patterson. - Ian how are ya? And where you been hiding? - I'm in great form dear boy. Been charging around the country putting together this collection of mine. - [James] How's it going? - Well pretty well on the whole I think which is why I'm calling you. How's your diary? Got any free time reasonably soon old chap? - Well I could always fit you in. What have you in mind? - Well I'm not quite sure to tell you the truth. I rather want to get some photos of this collection of mine. The way I see it is a set of simple shots of each one plus a shot showing them all together. That's if you agree of course. - Well your choice. I'd like to take them out under the trees I think. - Anything you say. How about placing some young thing as an eye catcher? - Oh you dirty old man. Well it might liven them up a bit. Give the picture some balance. - [Ian] Balance. - Yes, depth, color, composition, that sort of thing. Anyway that's my worry, it needn't be your problem. - Thank God for that. Never could get to grips with you artistic chaps nothing concrete to get hold of, all in the mind. - That's nice, who lives there? - It used to belong to my mechanic. He was with me for years. Pity, he departed this life last year. I use it as a spare room now. - Funny world dear boy, I'd never had dreamed 20 years ago that this line of work would be so profitable. Why I've made more in five years of private practice than my entire 25 years with Scotland yard. - But surly you miss your old mates hm? - Oh they've all left or retired, most have got cushy jobs with large companies. In fact one of my formal colleagues is instrumental in my securing a very lucrative contract with CBM. - Another lager for me and me mate. So you're still in computer espionage hm? - I most certainly am. In my profession dear boy, computer espionage is the trend of the future. - Okay, that's it, oh nice profile. That's a girl. Fine. Well that's enough on that car. (gentle music) Okay well let's go in here, now I want you to lie back on the upholstery, that's it, let's pretend it's 1936 and we're selling model T Fords to the discriminating english gentry. Excellent. (dramatic music) - They're nice I'm impressed. - Thank you. - It must be fun being a photographer, meeting all different sorts of women. - Oh it's not what you think. - No? - Well I suppose I'm attracted to my models, otherwise I wouldn't get good pictures. If you get between them and the camera sometimes the pictures suffer as a result. - I see, oops. (dramatic music) (water rushing) (eerie music) (water running) (birds chirping) - [Howard] Hello. - Hello, I didn't see you there. - [Howard] Would you like a drink? - No thank you. - Anything wrong? Got something on your mind? - Wrong? No what ever gave you that idea? - Well you haven't been yourself these past few days, I thought perhaps something was worrying you. - No, nothing at all. Yes I think I will have that drink. - [Howard] Any problems with the photographer? - No it's going fine. Look I'm sorry if I'm a bit off, I don't mean to be. - I'll tell you what, let's go shopping, we haven't done that for a long time. I am celebrating a successful business deal and new clothes will put the sparkle back into you. - What a lovely idea, thank you. (whimpering) (suspenseful music) - Well gentlemen I believe we all understand one another, and know the basic reasons for our being here tonight. Mr. Mehet has been kind enough to bring a short reel of film with him for us to see, Mr. Mehet? (film clicking) - Gentlemen, this is the Essex 80 tank manufactured by a certain communist country friendly to my government. 200 of these tanks have recently been supplied to my country and I must admit that we are most pleased by their performance. (film clicking) - And gentle men it seems that for a certain price Mr. Mehet's government could actually afford to lose a dozen of these tanks without much difficulty or write them off as having been lost in combat. And I just happen to know the commander in chief of a black revolutionary army in Africa who would be most happy to purchase these lost tanks for a price that will produce a tidy little profit for all parties involved. Of course for political reasons Mr. Mehet's government can't deal directly with the revolutionaries, that's where we come in. Well gentlemen, are we interested? - Christ, last year we buy wheat from the Americans and sell it to the Russians, this year we're buying tanks from the Arabs and selling them to the Africans. My God what's this world coming too? Yes of course I'm interested. - I also am interested but what about the details? Such as what are the prices involved? How are the goods to be shipped? And most important, how are the payments to be made? (dramatic music) - Well how'd it go? - So so, disappointing at first but it'll work out. - Oh that's good. - And how are you? - I'm fine but Howard I've got a headache. - How untimely. - Yes I know I'm sorry but I'm just not in the mood. - You haven't been in the mood all week. Have you already forgotten this afternoon? - Ouch, will you please be gentle with me? (cries out) Just because you've had a bloody bad business meeting doesn't mean you can take it out on me. - You bitch. (smacks) (cries out) (crying) (dramatic music) (squeaking) - [James] That's enough. - Oh it's lovely. Can you pass me a rag? Thank you, I have to go to a reception and I mustn't look stodgy. - Do you have to leave soon? - Oh no, those things go on all night. (chatting) (gentle music) - Well gentlemen I certainly thank you for your visit and wish you a pleasant journey home. And no doubt I shall hear from your embassy about your decisions. - Right, last one. - Didn't you ever have an assistant? - I usually hire photography students but the last one just went back to collage. Why do you want the job? - Hm, it's a thought. - Excuse me. Ed, I've got a job for you. No there's no need to meet now, just listen. Simone has gone to Crompton's place. I want you to go there. - Right Mr. Townsend, we're on our way. - James? Howard's been acting very strange lately. - You mean he suspects? - Oh yes I'm certain of it. And besides us there's been some other strange goings on. - Such as? - Well first off all last week Howard's business manager committed suicide for no apparent reason. And then he had a meeting where he was showing a film of tanks and guns and I don't know what. (dramatic music) (bangs) (gasps) - Stay put sunshine, don't move, keep perfectly still. - For Christ sake, what's all this about? (whacks) - You weren't listening were you sunshine? Just be a good boy and do what you're told. - You, go get your gear and make it quick. - [James] Who the hell are you? What do you want? - [Man] Alright sunshine, all in good time, you'll find out. (fingers snapping) - [James] What you gonna do with her? - She's coming with us, you're going in another direction. Keep her in there eh? I'm gonna have a word with sunny Jim here. Now that's a bird with real form hey? A shame to spoil it it, wouldn't it? Now you listen carefully cause I'm gonna explain something to you and I do hate having to repeat myself. I want you to take this letter and give it to Mr. Townsend. Tell him that the lady with the form has fallen into the wrong hands. - You mean you're not from Townsend? - Right. Now you just do what you're told, give him the letter, tell him to read it carefully, he will quickly get the message. - He'll probably go straight to the police. - No he won't do that, no if I know him. He'll pay a great deal of attention to the envelope he might, he just might, be more than a little upset with you but the police never, not if he wants to see her alive again. - And what if he thinks I'm involved with you? - Well that's your problem isn't it? If he finds out about this little bit of beddy bies we're going to have to find ourselves a new messenger boy. Mr. Townsend can be very unpleasant when he's upset. Believe me I know. - Look, I don't know what's going on between you and Townsend but if you lay a finger on her I'll get you. - I'll bare that in mind sunshine. (door bangs) This should keep you occupied for a while. Nothings gonna happen to the lady for the time being. You'll be hearing from us as to what happens next. Mind the road sunshine. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. (dramatic chord) (engine rumbling) - [Ed] That'S his studio there. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (crickets chirping) - [James] I'll wait here for you. (dramatic music) (chattering) - Now then Compton what the hell's this all about? - Look Mr. Townsend I'm a photographer, not a clairvoyant. All I know these heavies come, they lay into me, they take Simone and then they tell me to give you this note. - When did this happen? - About an hour ago when we were working. - You expect me to believe that? You wouldn't be trying to hustle me would you? Most unwise Crompton, most unwise. - Look I know it's incredible but it's a fact, look. - Did you notice anything about them? - No it all happened so fast. One was a big guy, bald head, cockney accent. - Well, well, so that's it. 200,000 well it's a nice round figure, I suppose they will have to be told that I will pay. - Thank God for that. - Oh don't misunderstand me Mr. Crompton, what I say and what I do are two entirely different things. - [James] I can't believe it, it's like a bloody nightmare. - [Harold] Well consider yourself lucky, nightmares are things you wake up from. First I want proof that Simone is alright. A note from her plus a photograph. Then tell them I'll be ready to deal. If you have ever felt danger before, remember it and feel it now. I guarantee you have never stood so close to oblivion. If anything happens to Simone as a result of anything you do wrong there is not place anywhere and I mean anywhere that you can hide from me. That is a promise. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - This is where you'll stay. There's magazines here and there's a loo down the corridor. Now there'll be someone outside all the time so don't try anything funny. (thuds) Oh yes the ah, the windows are bolted. So have a good holiday eh? - [Man] And I want someone on Crompton from now on 24 hours a day. (upbeat music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Man] Crompton? - Yeah, yeah I'm here alone. - [Man] What did Townsend say? - Well besides being madder than hell, he says he'll pay the cash but first he wants some proof that she's alright. He wants a note in her hand writing and some photographs. - [Man] Alright we'll get them to you. And with the instructions and what to do with the money. You'll be hearing from us. (buzzes) (door bangs) - For you. (door thuds) (knocks) - Yes? - I'm just off down to the shops. Do you want something? - Oh, yes thank you, just a minute I'll make you a list. (phone whirring) - [Rhoda] Hello? - Rhoda, it's James, now look something important has happened. Now I can't really tell you about it now but we've got to cancel all appointments for the rest of the week. - [Rhoda] What, you don't mean it? - Yeah I'm afraid I do. Tell every one I've got flu and reschedule them for next week. - [Rhoda] You're joking. - Oh I wish I were, no this is for real. Now I want you to phone form your place and... (dramatic chord) - Hey you know I've been thinking. - Yeah? - We both worked for that bastard Townsend for seven years? Always doing the dirty work while he jets around in style. - So what else is new? - Well, we are getting a nice chunk of his cash as our just rewards but there might be something else we can do as revenge for our exploitation. - Such as? - Well, that is his mistress in there. (ominous music) All lonely and helpless and... You know what I mean. - Yeah I know what you mean. (ominous music) - What do you want? - Oh tell us a few things about Townsend, like what's he like in bed? What about yourself? I ah, bet your quite a hot piece of crumpet. Hey now, what's the matter baby? (whacks) (crying out) (thudding) (crying out) - Come on. Shut up. (crying out) (dramatic music) Shut up you bitch. (crying out) Could make it a lot easier on yourself if you don't resist. (dramatic music) (screaming) (thuds) - You bastards! Get the hell out of here! This is not part of the arrangement understand? I'm sorry lady. It won't happen again. Get out! (dramatic chord) (dramatic chord) (camera clicking) - That's six, that should be enough, shouldn't it? - Yeah that's alright. - Here, who's gonna develop these pictures? You don't trust them to Kodak do you? - Who do you think Crompton is genius, a plumber? We'll send the film to him, tell him to develop it. Here's a pen, write a note to Mr. Townsend and tell him you're okay. (phone ringing) - Here! What was that? - Shut up. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Yes? - [Man] Hello, Bishop's coal delivery. Checking to see if you need anything while I'm in the neighborhood. Been a bit nippy this winter hasn't it? - [Man] No we're okay. We've got all the coal we need for now. - [Man] All right, here's me card, give us a call if you need more. - [Man] Right will do, now goodbye. - [Man] Goodbye. (door thuds) (camera snaps) (suspenseful music) - Do you think he was legit? - I dunno, he looks okay. But just the same, we better stay on our toes. - Yeah. (engine rumbling) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello sunshine. Listen sunshine, in the dust bin behind your place you're gonna find a package. Now in that package is instruction on how to deliver the money, there's a note from the lady and there's a roll of film. Now I want you to develop that film and take the whole lot to Townsend. (clicks) (buzzes) (suspenseful music) - So you see how I got myself into this position. You're the only person I can trust. - Steady on old chap. Let's deal with one thing at a time, you just relax for a moment while I fix you a drink. - I know I'm being tailed but I don't know by whom. Could be Townsend or the other heavies. I suspect my phone's been tapped. Christ knows what else. Really it's not my scene at all. - Try this. Now let's take a look at this license number and see where that leads us. - Can you trace the owner? - Well that poses no problem, come dear boy let's take a look at how the other half makes a living. Might take your mind off things. You see we use this and this. It's like this dear boy, hundreds of computers in this country keep different files on everything from Scotland Yards most wanted criminals to a list of people who subscribed punch. Most of these computers are accessed by computer terminals which are then joined by ordinary telephone lines. Each terminal has it's own code and each computer has it's own phone number. This black book contains the telephone numbers of most of the top secret computers in this country. - How did you acquire the black book? - Well my dear boy, 25 years at Scotland Yard has some compensations. Actually licensed investigations are the most common, the computer files are kept for the central processes in the Home Office. I've just set the code and we dial the computer like this. (phone whirring) Now what was that number again? (clicking) (electric beeping) Mr. Harry Mosley eh? I'll have one of my men check him out, if he's not involved at least he should be able to lead us to the house, let's meet here tomorrow. (dramatic chord) (suspenseful music) - They want the money on Thursday night. They're only giving us 30 minutes notice as to where we'll meet. - Bastards. That gives me just two days. Okay I'll have the cash by Thursday afternoon. - And another thing. Would you mind telling me what the hell this is all about? - I'm still not convinced that you're not involved Crompton. But just let's just say the nature of my business causes some people to bear grudges against me. Now if those people are also politically orientated then one has to be very sure of ones footing before making reprisals. (knocking) - You up? Everything okay? 60 hours from now you are gonna be a free bird. At least from us you will be. - You don't really think you're gonna get away with this do you? You must be joking, between Howard's men and the police you don't stand a chance. - The police? (chuckles) Lady you don't know your Mr. Townsend very well. He is up to his neck in so much that there is no way he is going to go to the police. Here, I'm gonna show you something. Alright, this is last weeks evening paper. I collect these. Now who do you think originated the idea of David Green taking a leap, hm? I could also list 10 other people who owe their fate to your Mr. Townsend. And I can guarantee you that there is not a chance of it happening to me. However, if I were a gambling man and I am not, but if I were I would bet that the next name on Mr. Townsend's obituary list would be that of Mr. James Compton. (dramatic chord) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) - We found the house, it's in Hertfordshire. - Should we go there? - Yes, but first I want you to hear something. Some recordings I've made. This should amuse you. - Hello, hello Mr. Townsend it's Ed. We've follow Crompton back to his studio he's there now, came directly from your place. However before he went to you he visited a strange looking place in Soho, looked like a betting office. - [Ian] Betting office? What nonsense. - [Crompton] Nice guy I've got us involved with. - From what we've been able to observe the girl is held in an upstairs room and three men stay in the house with her. - Suppose we made some sort of a diversion, something that would momentarily move them away from her? And if we could get away with her without being seen ourselves all the evidence would point to Townsend wouldn't it? - That would put the cat among the pigeons. - Especially if they saw our car which just happened to be a Rover 2000. (knocking) - Shirley. - Yes sir? - Put on a mini skirt and heavy makeup, we've got a special assignment for you. - Okay. - That's a good girl. Rover 2000 did you say? (upbeat music) Now it's our turn. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) - Bastard. (dramatic music) - You sure you want to go through with this? We could just let Townsend pay the ransom. - Christ I'd rather she stayed with the kidnappers than went back to him. - I'm pretty sure it wouldn't go over there. - Alright, don't fucking tell me. (snoring) (engine rumbling) - Here we are. - That's it. - What time is blast off? - How about one a.m. alright? - Yeah, okay. Well let's get going. - Just a second. You almost forgot something. - [James] Is this necessary? - I think so, and remember James, no fancy heroics. I'm still not convinced the lady's worth it. (suspenseful music) (thuds) - Stick. (suspenseful music) (booms) (window shatters) - Oh my God. - Come on. (fire crackling) - [Man] Come on, move. The girl! (cries out) - [James] Ah that's it, that's it. - Go, I'll follow them. - [James] This way. (dramatic music) (fire crackling) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (cries out) Go! (engine rumbling) (gun firing) - Shit. Hey that was one of Townsend's cars, wasn't it? - And then one night I over heard them talking. They all used to work for Howard, that's how they knew his operation. - You mean there's no political connection? - Political? No, they're just ordinary gangsters after the money. Hey where are we going? - Well we can't go to my place, it's being watched. (gentle music) We could stay here for a few days, take it easy, decide what we're gonna do. - I wish I had a needle and thread. - Oh I'll get supplies when the shops open. - James I can't stay here. - [James] Hm? - It wouldn't work. - [James] What won't work? - Look I'm scared, if Howard finds out about us I don't know what he's gonna do. I've got to go today. - You're kidding, you wouldn't go back to him now, not after what's happened. - Look I don't know, I don't know anything anymore, all I know is that I must go today and it's for your safety as well. - [James] Bullshit. - Look try and understand, I got us into this mess and I know I can get us out. - That's bullshit and you know it. - It's not and you know it. Please be patient. Staying with you now is not gonna solve anything. It'll all work out. - Oh Christ. - I'll phone you. (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) - You'll have to stop at the gates. (engine rumbling) That's odd. He's usually there. Oh, do drive on. (engine rumbling) (ominous chord) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (screams) - Thank God. - What happened? - They came here, Bradley. Phone an ambulance. (eerie music) (phone whirring) (eerie music) - [Howard Voiceover] You bitch. (smacks) (eerie music) (gun fires) (eerie music) (dramatic music) (Multicom Jingle)
