Every time I think of you it's the laughter I see. Your eyes when you did something bad and hid behind dad. Do you still do that? In your last letter you said: Soraya and Fatemeh said hi. I remember who Fatemeh is. Her child was ill. How's he? Any better? How's Ali Mardani and auntie Mahin? They grocery story, the baker, The supermarket. I want you guys. I want to queue up at the baker's. Walk around, shop. I feel like that neighbourhood is life. Let me post my letter. See there? Ali sent them all. He sends one every two days.

Ask me to slow down but Once when I heard you scream you were on the ground, crying. I panicked, I was so scared. You trusted me still and got on my bike. Hi Moghadam. Hi, yes. Do you have time for a word? Sure, come in. - Thanks. Yes Mr. Fakhar. Moghadam. God bless haji Ghafour. He spoke well of you. Your friendship, morals. He said his son-in-law had a future.

Say hi. - Sure. I'll take that. Sorry. - It's ok, bye. I'm working harder on my studies especially the important ones. Let's see if I can become a good lawyer for you. Sweetest brother. Hi. Hi. Hi love. - Thanks love. You could've pulled him aside to say it. So everyone is free to do whatever. No. Do it right. In calm. People expect it of me. Not to have a go. They expect a kind word. Shouting makes it worse. Dear Mr. Ali Fakhar. Hi. As of September, you can call your sister a law student. Parastoo. Come for dinner. It's getting cold. Here you go. - Thanks. Thank you! - You thought you've no gift. Thanks. What is it? Wow. Thanks love. Do you like it? - Yes beautiful. Ali called this morning. - This morning? Yeah. - What did he say? Happy Mother's Day He's missed. Where did she go? I don't know, she probably went to get something. That's for Ali. Thanks. The sky is strange here. The stars surround the moon. Although the people are nice. There are no familiar faces. I seek refuge in the sky here. Mum sounded upset but didn't say why. She was real upset. What is it sis? I know what she said. That I lie. Or I don't say it all. No I do, I just don't explain. I know I shouldn't have drowned in my own world for long. It was a mess. It went past a simple warning. He was expelled I got a letter to bring dad in. I'd rather die than give it to dad. They brought him in eventually. I was about to burst into tears. Such a huge mess over nothing. I wish you were here. All I do is apologise. Embarrassment and apologies. I don't think I can go to uni anymore. Everything is bitter Ali. It's not some stuff. Laws of the neighbourhood. People look at you or talk to you weirdly. Forget you. Thanks, bye. Bye. Parastoo. I'll wait for your call. I've moaned in my letter so much I bore you. It's as if everything I do is wrong. I ended it I quit and decided to go quietly home. Not the truth or lies. Not up or down. Just silence. I won't ever have to explain to anyone. Where to? She's asleep upstairs. [Weaving and sales of wicker] Hi. Hi. Bye. Although you're young. You do understand me. My wife and I grew apart after we had a child. It was mutual, it didn't bother us much. She loves to care for her child. I loved that she was caring for my child. Love you dad, thanks. -I came to my senses after the next one. She sees me as an object. I'm not trying to be boring. Believe me. You know more about me than my wife. It's my job. We've had your case at our office for two years. It's hard when no one sees you. I've been married for a couple of years. But I'm a stranger in my own home. Like an object appearing at night. All mothers are the same. They care more for their kids. Excuse me! Bita. Happy birthday Parastoo. I was kidding when I said I couldn't drive. Careful not to hit people, cars are ok. You're a decent girl. Look after yourself. Thanks. - You're welcome. I love driving. Especially at night when the roads are empty. Don't worry. Thanks. It was fun. My friend lives here. No problem. Goli. It was fun. Sure. - Thanks. Hi. I'm not that free. You hung up on me after so many calls. Would I ever do that? You're my friend. - Friend? You don't even answer. You think I'm like your sissy friends. You can lead on? Give that to me. Give it. Enough. What is it? Stop it. - Sorry. What is it? - What did you expect? He takes your grudges out on me. Don't think he's in love with you. You said no, he's mad. Don't think you're smart. You'll end up like me. What's wrong with you? So pretty, and nice. Don't you want your baby? I'll get it. Baby. I long to see him. He took him to keep me here. To beg and depend on him. You'd stay anyway. You love him Bita. Shut up. - I'm not wrong. You are. - You know. Shut up. What is it? Nothing. Parisa. Get back. I'm talking to you. Where are you Bita? My kid. You don't know where it is? Where's the prescription? I forgot. Hi. - I need a cab. We don't have any available. The last one just left. Price? I'm Jirani. So you're new. The clearer the better, price? Sorry I... Need to get to a pharmacy. It's two streets from here. Is this enough? Have you run away? From what? So you're a thinker, we have to discuss everything. You didn't hear what I said. I want to get to the pharmacy. I thought you were a decent person. Pull over. - Everyone says the same. I know you all All. Same story. You have family issues. Your dad or brother have made life difficult. You want to become independent over night. Or no. The guy lied to you. You saw him with someone else. You've decided to take revenge. I said to pull over. - I'm right though. That's what the thinkers are like. What? You were probably made to marry someone when you loved someone else. Now you find her unbearable. Or the type whose wife hates him. Men who cheat on their wives, are hated by them. She doesn't love you? Don't pretend it hit home. Open it. Bitch. Get out of my car. Why would you hit me? Why? Get out bitch. Parastoo. Hi, what is it? Mum,it's Parastoo. Let me open up. She's my friend. - No she's not anymore. It's fine. What happened? You're not telling the truth. We are, we were together when she was run over. Are you feeling better? The smell of hospitals make me sick. Go home, I'm fine. I'll go for some fresh air. I'll be here. Lovely. Do you need something? Are you in pain? Could you kiss me? It's ok. This will calm you. Hi. It's Ali. Ali is here. Pray she turns out fine. Isn't she feeling better? We can't tell right now. We have to wait for her X-rays. What's her name? Nasrine. - I can put her to sleep. Thanks. Yes love. You're laughing? She just got painkiller, she's deep asleep. What happened to her? The lady with her said she was run over by a bike. What lady? A tall woman, she's outside I think. It's ok, you can take her. Just wake her up. And get her discharge letter before her doctor leaves. Ok. - These are her x-rays. She was lucky not to hit her head. - It's her back a little. She has to be careful. Nothing else. Her wounds will heal soon. Here are her x-rays. She's just scared. Sister. Parastoo. Sis. Parastoo. Sis. Parastoo. Sister. What are you doing here? Are you ok? I was looking for you in your room. I made Qorma with fish once. He thought I was mental. He said I was sea sick. It's all water. And your only food is fish The sea makes you sick. Don't forget salt. My cooking is good. Let me make you something great. I didn't add salt on purpose. Mum. - Yes love. Parastoo went to get your medicine last night. She didn't lie. I want to have a party for you. She was run over by a bike. Is Friday ok? It doesn't work. She's in her room, come in. Sorry to bother you. - No bother. Thank God two people are still friends around here. Yeah we are. But no one is like you for her. I'm glad you're back. - Thank you. Parisa. She's not ok. You didn't let me in. What happened? Nothing. Did you see Ali? Ok. Go. Did I know Ali is back? I came to see you. My mum says people talk about you a lot. Like what? - I don't know. Didn't we grow up together? We did. Why did this happen? Mum says Parastoo has changed a lot. How? Your attitude. Not going to uni. Working. How you dress. At night. Midnight. The cars. Beautiful cars. Expensive. Every night a different car. You laughing. Me laughing? Stop it. What a mess. Give me a kiss. Thanks. Here you go. - Hi. How are you? - Good. Let me see. Your dad has come home for you. Hi. - We were talking about you. Yes. He stays at work for lunch, he's here for his son. Lucky us. Yes. - Your plate. Thanks. - I can do it I will. Thanks. Tell him. - Your son has made the food today. Thanks. - Yes I love you son. Some of the herbs are different I couldn't find them here. Give me your plate. Give me yours. That's ok, not too much. Thanks. Give me. Here. Thanks. Here. Here you go. Mum. Mum. Stop. I want a word. I'm suffocating. I'm busy, get back up. - No. Here, right now. What? This is my life. Ok, go on. Go on then. Sit. Why don't you talk to me? What's with you? You love seeing me cry, begging you where my baby is? Have you forgotten your promises? No I did my best. I don't want it to work. Isn't it bad enough you did it to me, and now her. Why won't you leave her alone? Parastoo isn't stupid like me. She hates you, and you deserve it. Wait and see how she'll fall at my feet. I won't let a kid play me. You know. Have you forgotten the days Mr Moghadam has taken in a lonely poor woman. Given her a place, food. Wasn't it true? Do you know what love is? Seriously. You think I did it for company? I loved you, idiot. My baby is 2 now. Our baby. I love her. Her brother is back. And they have each other's backs. So no way. How are you? You eavesdrop now. He'll punish you. You're not stupid. Here. Wow. It's so good. Good thing I stayed, or you'd give it away. Thanks. When did you grow up so fast? Are you happy with the firm you work at? Yeah. It's a lot better than uni. Do you like the environment? - My boss is great. There it is. It smells of our childhood. - Yeah. Now smell this. It's for men. - Take it if you like it. I get up in the morning, go to different courts, police stations. File cases. Book appointments. You have to bribe, you have to have cash. Sometimes you have to smile and be friendly. To move appointments and stuff. I'm at the office until I get home. I wish mum was here. She'd get angry. Aw. Don't look at them, they're bad girls. Who? - I'm good. You look cute. You're so clumsy, you keep falling. You need a wheelchair. - No need to distract me. Tell me a story. We reach a different beach every two days. Different beaches. Different people. Corals. Shells. I wish you'd take me. It's for men. It's beautiful, attractive. Sunrise, sunset, sounds light. It's scary. At first not so much. But later it gets real scary. My biggest phobia is drowning in the sea. You swell. It swallows you, sucks your soul and brings you back. I'm afraid of drowning. More so for you. It's horrible I don't want you to drown. If you don't risk it, how will you enjoy the water? You don't get what I mean? You do. The new buildings are so ugly around here. I'm here to help. - I don't have much to do. I'm here to keep the shop open. Why did you take down our childhood photos? You know what, dad? Mum always said you prefer a girl. He loves Parastoo. Parastoo always thought mum doesn't love her. Not not love her. She thought mum loved me more. She was wrong. - What about me? Parastoo was everything to me. We all love her. But don't be too harsh. Hi, do you take orders? No, it's all we have, take whichever works for you. Do you have any new designs with delicate wood? They're not meant to be pretty. They're to stop people looking inside. It's not supposed to attract attention. No I want a new one. We don't do them. Who left it here? Thanks love. Sorry for the trouble. Use as much water you love. Don't do this to your hands at least. The stench won't go away. You were like a mother to me. I'm saying it for you. Why do you hand wash them? Don't compare me to your mum please. I wish I was as brave. The poor widow. Some of these people were mean to her. Just because she wanted to raise her son alone. The smell is killing me. There's no smell. There is and you know it. That's why no one visits. Or you don't see me as much. That's why you left Moghadam's place. When your mum died, I told him you're like my son. He said ok. Remember Omid? You'd sit in a corner. Drawing pictures, doing your homework. When you got older, you only came home to sleep. I told Moghadam to get you colour pencils, to become friends. You didn't. Even later when you worked for him. You never did. Now I know why. Take care. Let me know if you need anything. Hi. Hi Omid. You won't take the machine? I don't need it for now. I'm selling the shop. Do you have anything there? No. Bye. I was going to write you a letter a while ago. After 6 years? What were you going to say? Nothing, go on. You're holding something back now. Get lost. How are the neighbours? No one is friendly anymore. Some stick their nose in each other's lives. Rumours, accusations. I'll get your a souvenir. Wow. Your shoes, futureless worker. It's too much. It's ok. - I don't suit it. No way. Your pants. Thanks. - Your original shirt. You bought these? Supposedly. Yes, I paid a lot. Wear it, so I can see. So much. You think you're still 10, going over to my house? Causing trouble. Unlocking the mains. You used to talk different back in the day. Have you forgotten? Asking, respect, crying. What happened? You made me promise here. You've a secret with me. It's hard. But I've kept it. I have nightmares every night. You're not a man of hard work. Keep sleeping. Keep having nightmares. Good evening. - Thanks. Read the statement for me. I say a lawyer because I saw the business card. It's in her room. Is there something wrong Ali? You know better. Yes. Excuse me! Parisa. I know it's late. Ali is it you? Have you heard from Parastoo? It's ok, don't worry. Her work has taken long. Ali. Ali. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I got home and you were out, I came to find you. I was home, you didn't come. I got out. What is it? Why do you look at me like that? No. I'm not. What is it? Nothing. - What? It's my foot. Nothing. Your heels are high. Ok. I can't stand you crying. You really have a lot of nerve. It suits you. Give us a turn too. She's pretty. If you're so sensitive. Stop your sister before she gets any worse. It suits you. What happened? - I don't know, we'll talk. What did he say? - The bastard. Go. I can't, I'm sorry Bita. I promised but he goes too fast. It's ok Parastoo. I don't want you to see him anymore. He can't do anything. He has, and he'll continue to. He does this to me to get close to Monir. Monir keeps washing. And washing. I swear I feel for her too. Let me talk to the lawyer. I told you no. Not the police or the law. I want to take my baby back myself. You weren't there to see. He has a lot of audacity. Can you ask Omid? Why him? The was angry at him. The goody two shoes. Ali loves you, just take care of him. He doesn't know. Leave it to me. Look after him. Ali wait. Ali. I never made it tragic. Who knows what really happened. I'm stuck. Talk to her. - No. You have to. - No. Remember how Parastoo got up one day to see you gone? Why did you leave? - Can't you see me now? How dare you leave. - I'm stuck I got stuck. Between three people I love. Parastoo Dad. My mum. You don't get it I'm trapped I am. - Ali. There's no question in her life. In the name of God. Enough! I'm sick of this, enough. Parisa. - Let's go. Miss Parastoo Fakhar. Daughter of Mohammad-Ali Fakhar. Has become problematic due to immoral behaviour. We as the neighbours request for You're signing a petition? I'm here to sign. Move. I'm tired of this hill. Dad. Are you closing? If you had broken her leg the first night she was late, we wouldn't be here, right now. I was going to kill her the night before you came. What? Your mum agreed. For the rumours? - What? Ok. I'll do it myself. Give me 24 hours. Please Ok dad? Ok? Ali. You're late. They'll find her dead body one of these days. Hi. I'm ready. I closed the shop. I spoke to someone to sell it. We talked, I asked for 2 days. One day. Son. I'm tired. Your dad is too. I stopped him from selling the house. Calm down. - No. We spoke on the way, you've packed. I said I'd fix it. I... I wish I hadn't come. Go to your room until I say so. Go. Go to your room. Can I drink water? We played a game when we were kids. It's not a game anymore. - Shut up. I remember it. Whoever is asked a question goes under. They can stay as - I said I remember. I'll start. Parastoo ask. Omid ask. - Yes. Would you wish you had no dad? No. Question? Question? No. Ali. Why do you come home late? My work takes long sometimes. - Like how long? That's two questions. - She didn't answer fully. Do you have a question? - I do, you. What about a sister? You wish you didn't have one? No. I'm out. - You shouldn't have started. We'll carry on. - Question? Do you come straight away? No. A lot of the time no, why would I? Is it fun? Question. Why did you leave? For money? You got away from here too. You're a boy you can. Question Parastoo. You're ruining- -I've a question. I'll ask you. Do you love Parastoo? I love all of you. - Parastoo. Parastoo too. Question. Parastoo. Where were you with Bita that night? I went to get mum's medicine. The driver was a bastard. I said no, so he battered me. I left my bag in his car. Parisa didn't let me in So I went to Bita. She took me to the hospital. Then you came. Omid, question. Bita's baby. What do you want to know? - Where is it? Dead. Question. I can't ask another question? - Yeah but me first. Do you still love Parastoo? Answer. I said yes. A thousand times. What's your point? Yes. Leave me alone. Yes. Question. Question. Who's Bita? How do you know her? Moghadam's temporary wife. She has a baby with him. Had, who she can't see. He said he loved me. He said to Bita. If Parastoo stays with me, I'll give your kid back. I did a little for Bita. He went too fast so I stopped. A few days ago. Same Moghadam? There was no baby. It was born dead. It was her own fault. Moghaddam didn't want her to know. He asked me to bury it. So I did it in his own garden. Why didn't you tell her? When someone has raised you. And holds it ever your head. When he says to keep a secret. What's it to you? She's my friend. She's a mother. Bita was never my problem. Parastoo. I've a question. Yes, go on. The gold, the money, the phone. A house, why do you have them? Where did they come from? You won't say? Moghaddam gave them to me. I saved them for Bita's baby. I was never a bad person. It was a bad game. Wouldn't I tell him if he'd ask. You should've told him before. It's not fair. He says my baby is here. My baby. It's here. Hi. - Hi Ali. Is everything ok? Say hi. Parastoo. Greet them. Go. Go. Go love. Welcome. Thank you for coming. Thanks. We named you Parastoo. [a bird] I flew away. Parastoo flies. I always look for one when I see birds. Parastoo, this world isn't for me. I'm way too small. I've no expectations I don't want everything anymore. Omid. Get up. Please. Get up. Say hi to everyone. Say I've named stars after everyone. Mum Dad Parisa. Omid My classmates Mohammad Reza. Majid Akram Afsaneh Reza. I know them all. I say hi to them all at night.
