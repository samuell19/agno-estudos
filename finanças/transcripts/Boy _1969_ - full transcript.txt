And again. I guess I'm it. Hurry up and hide. On Kochi's Harimaya Bridge A monk bought a woman's hairpin On Kochi's Harimaya Bridge... I caught you! Come on, cry! Kids cry when they're caught! I'm it! Where'd you all go? I'm gonna catch everyone who's playing hooky. It's bleeding, Papa. It's bleeding. One more. Make it two. You see, the money from that company in Osaka hasn't come yet. You've been prompt in paying, so I'll give you a few more days. Thank you for your patience. Kid, ready to go? Peewee, let Papa carry you. When bad things happen, kids start bawlin'. Come on. Mama! No such luck. - You get the license number? - I messed up. Peewee, wanna sit on Papa's lap? We have to keep trying. Pinch me. Pinch my back hard. Harder! Mama! Are you okay? Mama! - I was driving carefully. - You hit her! You hit her? What happened? - She got hit! Hey, let me see your license. Stop acting like a cop. You mean you don't have one? Of course I do! I've never been in an accident before. Looks like your luck ran out. The doc said two weeks in bed. Two weeks? I can't get two weeks off work! Impossible! How am I supposed to look after two kids with a cracked hip? A cracked hip? We'll know more after the X-rays. Then we'll go to the police. Now, let's not rush into... It wasn't my fault! We'll let the police decide. Yes, that's best. It wasn't my fault either. We'll have them investigate. How dare you! Mama, are you all right? Does it hurt? Should I rub it? I've never been in this situation before. Maybe we could just... settle this privately. No, no settlement. If guys like you aren't punished, there'll be no end to accidents. Sir, could we talk over here a minute? Does it really hurt? If a woman hurts her hips, she's no longer a woman. That's too greasy. I can't eat it. Order something else. I feel like throwing up. And I'm numb from my hips to my back. You can rest for a couple of days. Two weeks. That's what the doctor said. We should keep going. We're on a roll. Then you jump in front of the cars! Come on, now. You know I'm not well. Right, the wounded veteran with a gimp hand and diabetes. Sounds perfect for getting hit by a car. What? Stop jabbering. Kid... ls it good, kid? Have this, too. I don't wanna. You can always go back to your grandparents' house on the beach. Can't we just quit this business? It's not like I enjoy it. I don't like it either. But how else are we gonna feed a family of four? Peewee. Sit down and be quiet. Brother, wake up! Going to see your real mother? She's rotting away from intestinal tuberculosis. What're you going to do in that hospital? I'm not going. - Going to the beach, then? - No. See? He's staying with his old man. You don't have to do this. I'll talk to your father. What'll it be, kid? Wonton soup. Don't be shy. Two orders of noodle broth and one wonton soup. Noodles! Not spoon! I'm using chopsticks! That's mine! I'm not the one working. I'll take the smaller dish. Here, you can have this. Kid, need to go to the restroom? Let's go. Eat that when we come back. I'll go to the station and buy tickets. Huh? When you finish the job, have me paged at the station. Got that? But what if... Don't worry. Work is work. Just do your job. I should really buy new glasses. I'm not saying I won't do it, but I'm afraid. I was afraid too. I wish I could use ninja skills! - That stuffs all fantasy. - I wish I were an alien! There are no aliens. There's no such thing. Buy that for me. No taxis or fast drivers. Just station wagons or compacts with company logos. Woman drivers are best. MY Son! Those are seagulls. Try saying that. Seagulls... That's right. You know what they do? They snap fish up and eat them! Fish... You know what fish do? The big fish eat the little fish. Little fish eat worms and seaweed. Sea-weed. Seaweed... The sea goes on and on and covers the whole world. And at the bottom of the sea... there are mountains, rivers, and roads. And amazing monsters live down there too. Monsters! Monsters... Light beams shoot from their eyes, and they breathe fire. Grr... gwah! They're nasty. But the aliens annihilate them! I'm from the Andromeda nebula. I'm an alien who's come to save the world. - Alien... - Didn't know that, did you? I may look like a normal person, but I'm a genuine alien from the Andromeda nebula. Andromeda nebula. Andromeda nebu... Good! You understand me. I've come to kill the evildoers who want to wipe out humanity! I'm a cosmic messenger of justice! We've pulled off seven jobs so far. Two other tries didn't earn us anything. I've been slowly getting better at it. Now I can take a fall without hurting myself. The worst part is the doctors' exams. I always feel like they know I'm lying. Papa taught me to hold my breath while I cry "It hurts!" We'll be at Onomichi soon. You can't see Shikoku anymore. Mama gives me a hundred yen for each job. Soon I'll have a thousand. - Does that hurt? - A little. That's a good color. MY Son! Does this hurt? Idiot! What if he'd been crippled? I'm sorry. Son, forgive me. I think it best to admit him and give him a thorough examination. We're leaving soon. We already have our tickets. So what are you saying? I'm saying I'm willing to settle if you pay in cash. I'm just a driver. Where will I get 50,000 yen in cash? Then we'll have to go to the police. Fine. Call the police. What? You hit another person's child! Don't you have a shred of conscience? OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT Will you be having lunch? - Nothing for me. - Me neither. Kid? Later. Let me know when you're ready. Really, now! Can't you do something besides yawn? - Like what? - How should I know? All my gambling buddies are in Osaka. No gambling. We don't have that kind of money. Without my buddies I can't anyway. Why not play some pachinko? You can't win at pachinko. It's no fun not having a place to call home. What are you talking about? We're staying in a nice inn. - Where are you going? - The bathroom. Kokura, Wakamatsu Tobata, Yahata... It's all right. Forget it. Aren't you gonna eat? Where's the boy? - Maybe he ran away. - Heaven forbid. You've been giving him those hundreds of yen. It's enough for a trip. If you're worried about him, take the money back. Listen... I'm pregnant. What'll we do? Not much we can do. - Should I have it? - Go ahead. - It's okay if I have it? - Nah, go get an abortion. We can't live like this with a third child! We need an apartment. You have to get a legit job. The kids have to go to school, we have to buy furniture... Stop it! Let's not rush things. We'll keep doing this work for a while. We're saving up, little by little. - I wonder how the boy feels. - It doesn't matter how he feels. I meant about me. You were separated from your parents when you were four, right? Yeah, and my adopted mom got married four times. Yeah, I remember. We'll wake the baby. I hated her. I thought I'd be better off alone. Then he's probably thinking the same. Stop it! Not till we decide if I'm having the baby. Do whatever you want. I want it. What? Fine, I'll get an abortion. I'll find a doctor tomorrow. Not here! I lived a long time in Fukui. I know a good doctor there. All right. Let's go to Fukui. - When? Right now. You pack, while I pay the bill. What's the rush? The boy's not back yet. - Maybe he ran away. - And what if he did? We'll worry about that later. I've had enough! I have a baby inside me. - You said you're getting an abortion. - I said enough! Fool. He hasn't run away. But... Go look for him if you're so worried! I'll take the baby and luggage to the station and buy tickets. Don't give me that look! You're the one who bumped into us! I'm sorry. Listen here... what's the big idea, bumping into us? - I was reading - - Little twerp! Don't play dumb! I... I didn't mean to do it. We won't beat you up if it was unintentional, but we still demand satisfaction. - Satisfaction? - Yeah, money! If you hit someone, you gotta pay their hospital bills. Only a thousand yen? You that poor? Next time watch where you're going. Stop looking at me like that! - What are you looking at? - I... Shut up! Mama! - Where have you been? - I was just... - I thought you'd run away. - What? You won't get away that easily. - What happened? - We're leaving. We have to hurry. - My hat. - What about it? - I was drying it. - What do you need that for? You tryin' to get killed? What about here? - Dear. - What? - Isn't this too expensive? - Only the best for us. Come on, kid. Don't look so down. You can't win'em all. Higashiyama is known for its flowers Nishiyama for its autumn leaves in the rain Look at the mountains in the rain At all the views of the open sea Kinosaki is a lovely place Thank you. How I envy you, all together as a family. Anyone would want a father like this. Right, little boy? That's right. - Would you like another song? - Let's see. You request something. - Maybe one of the old popular tunes. - Where are you from? - Fukui. Actually, we're from Kochi. We'll perform something in the Tosa style from that region. On Kochi's Harimaya Bridge A monk bought a woman's hairpin Yosakoi! Yosakoi! Let's show Mimase... How long has it been Since I left Kochi for the capital I remember my friends back home When I left... Even if you go back to Kochi, Grandma and Grandpa won't be pleased. They were very happy when you left. They said so in a letter they sent. And you can't go back to school. You're not enrolled. They don't even have a desk for you. Understand? As I left home I boldly vowed to return victorious How can I die before my deed is done Whenever I hear the bugle call to advance I remember that sea of waving flags The fields and forests are aflame We push through an endless wasteland In our steel helmets, hoisting the Rising Sun Brushing my horse's mane Who knows what the morrow will bring Bullets, tanks, bayonets A short night's rest in the bivouac I saw my father in a dream “Die for your country!“ he said I awoke to look up at a sky full of the enemy As I go into battle today I'll remember the bloodied, smiling face Of my comrade in arms as he slowly died “Long live the emperor!“ he said How could I ever forget his dying words I've long been ready to die... DEPARTURES FROM KINOSAKI Some bread, please. Ten... ...fifteen rolls. And five packs of gum. Two times seven is 14. Two times five is 10. So 750 yen. One child's fare to Kochi. Which Kochi? On Shikoku. That's 1,500 yen. Children are half price. It should be 750. You have to be under 12. You're already in junior high. Adult fare is 1,500. I've only got 1,000 yen. Then you can't go to Shikoku. Did you run away? No. I was just kidding when I said Shikoku. Then take a hike. One ticket for Amanohashidate. Now, listen. What? I'm serious this time. All right, then. Two hundred thirty yen. Your change is 770. Seven, eight, nine for the third day. Ten, eleven, twelve for the fourth day. Thirteen, fourteen... Grandma! Granny! I'm home. I've come back! I came back. I was on the train for days and took the boat all on my own. All I ate was bread. Fifteen rolls! I'm going to sleep. I'm so tired. Good night. Tomorrow? You can wake me up anytime. Listen, what's a doctor charge? - For what? - That thing for women, dummy. About one finger. Then for a rush job, five fingers should be enough. So let's aim for 70,000 today. - Ten times what we made on our first job - Yup. - So that means seven fingers today? - Yeah. MY Son! I want Mommy! Have her, then! Be quiet! Hey, kid... does it hurt? No. It just gave me a scare. If it hurts, just say so. Maybe a little. Good. A little pain will get the doc's attention. And it's already bruised, so you won't have to give me an injection. The kid's got it tough too, huh? - You... - What? You... What's that look? Should I really go today? Of course. That's why we came to Fukui... and are staying until tomorrow. I see. Don't go looking up any old friends. You don't have to tell me that. How could I face them? I think I'll take the baby to the department store. It'll be over in an hour. We're not working today? - You go with your mother. - OK. Why are you sending him with me? Because I can't be sure you're really going to the doctor. Why did you come back to Kinosaki? I was sure you wouldn't. - Why? Just a feeling. - Isn't it enough that I did? - Yes. It's just that... I came to this clinic once a long time go. A man came with me. - You understand these things? - A little. Run off and play for a while. - About an hour? - Two. Be back in two hours. Little brat! Trying to spy on me! You were going to tell your father, weren't you? Little bastard, say something! You wanted to punish me for being your stepmom, right? You're evil! Even worse than your father! Say something! I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? You're just being devious. You're going to tell him the second I turn my back! No, I won't. Liar! Kids hate their stepmoms. They take their real parents' side. I knew you hated me. You hate me, so you spied on me. If you hate me so much, just say so! Do I have to say that? There's nothing I can do anyway. - I don't feel or think anything. What an odd boy. You want anything? After all, I didn't spend that money. - I'd like a watch. - A wristwatch? One with the date and day of the week. - Those are expensive. - Forget it, then. No, I'll get you one, and in return you keep all this a secret. You'll really buy me one? Tell your father Mama went to the clinic while you played in the park for two hours. Yup, I played in the park. Don't let him see that. Keep it secret. What's the day today? Um... Wednesday. No, Friday. Day after tomorrow is Sunday. Every day feels like Sunday. I'll leave it set to Sunday. Soon you'll be able to go to school. Yeah... I Will. You'll go to school, I'll have the baby, and Peewee will go to kindergarten. - When will that be? - Soon. Real soon. We'll work and save up as much as we can. - Ouch! - What happened? Nothing. We'll need money, huh? - Yeah. - We'll need a lot. - Yeah, we'll need a lot. We went to a lot of places: Tsuruga... Nishimaizuru... Kanazawa, Toyama. If you look on a map, they're all on the Sea of Japan. The money we make on each job is slowly growing. That's what Papa says. Since my injuries really do hurt a lot... I don't have to lie to the doctors anymore. Saying something hurts when it really does - any kid can do that. Peewee is big and plump now. He understands more of what I say. Whenever we have some free time, he asks me to tell him about the aliens. There seem to be a lot of old injuries. - Have you been hurt before? - Dear. That hurts! Stop it! We'll take some X-rays, but I think it'll take a month for him to recover. A month! Are you kidding? I barely scraped him! Doctor, let me use your phone. Get me the police. Hey! Don't you feel bad about what you did? I'm a car mechanic. I know what a car looks like when it's hit someone. Does this hurt? Stop it! You'd drag an injured kid out in the middle of the night for an investigation? Is this how the police behave? - Get ready to go. - You reached a settlement? He'll only pay 60,000. I'll get it tonight at the station. There's no rush, then. Let him sleep. Don't be a fool. We can't dawdle. The cops might call us in again. - It's that bad? It doesn't feel safe. They took our pictures. - They've done that three times. - That's why it doesn't feel safe. Hey, get up. - We can't be seen together. - Where are we going? - Our tickets are for Fukushima. - We already passed Fukushima. - Really? - Don't play dumb. Where are we going? It doesn't matter. We'll keep changing trains for a couple days. - You can't be serious! - You think I'm joking? A man like me? They've taken his picture a number of times, but this was the second time for me. If they match it with the one from Tottori, the National Police Agency will figure out who I am. - It's the same for me. - But I have four previous offenses. We'll stop working for a while... and change our appearance. - It's already winter, huh? - Yeah, it's already winter. Can you see? Yeah, I can. You'll be a little dizzy until you're used to them. Do I have to wear these all the time? Yeah, except when you sleep. - My eyes hurt. - Of course they do. They're your mom's prescription. They aren't meant for your eyes. Your mother has to go without glasses for now. I'm going to stay in a separate hotel for a few days. It's not getting warm at all. It's broken. The kotatsu is broken. ls there another? No. It'll warm up after a while. You can have a hibachi, but you'll have to pay for charcoal. - Where's the phone? - Over there. Hello? Prince Hotel? Room 312, please. It's me. Nothing in particular. Hello? Hello? Wealthy men don't like pushy women. Mind your own business. You want the hibachi'? Mama. What's wrong? It's nothing. Go back to the room. The 13th, 14th... 15th,16th,17th... 18th,19th... I won't show it to him, all right? You can show it to him now. Come on. Let's go see your father. Third floor, right? Should I call him? Papa! Watch where you're going! Should we do a job, Mama? Mama! Are you all right? Mama! I'm so sorry. Are you all right? Why are you driving at night? Thank goodness you weren't hit. Nothing good about it. I'm four months pregnant. I'll drive you to the hospital. We're not going to the hospital. We're calling the police! Go call an ambulance. Let's go in my car. Call an ambulance. Wait, please! Perhaps some money... How dare you! We're not after your money! I know... but I'd rather not go to the police. How much? Well... as much as I can manage. Wait in the department store. I'll find two hotels. - Two? - Of course. Then he and I will work again tonight. - Again? - We did a job last night. Kid, you gotta wear your glasses. - I made him throw them away. - What? We'll do another job tonight. Go find your separate hotels. Kid, let's go. Don't you get it, idiot? I'm saving up money for the baby I'm carrying. That's why you're an idiot. It's your child. Kid, let's go. Where? - Let's just hop on a plane. - A plane? Really? Yes. An airplane! We can be aliens! - You want to fly that much? - So you were joking? No. We'll really do it. Where the hell do you think you're going? Hokkaido! Even if you say no. Why would I say no? I want to go too. Yeah, Hokkaido's just the place. Look, those are all clouds. A sea of clouds. There are monsters in that sea too. There are the ghosts of birds, and the ghosts of butterflies. - Butterflies... - That's right. The aliens will whoosh out from between those clouds. They know right away where the ghosts are hiding. The aliens come all the way from the Andromeda nebula. Andromeda nebula... We really went to Hokkaido. I was raised in Kami County in Kochi Prefecture, so I'd never seen snow before. It was pure white, as far as the eye could see, like a sea of snow. Hakodate, Iwamizawa, Obihiro... Kushiro, Abashiri... Asahikawa, Wakkanai. Papa told us not to pull any jobs, but Mama and I did anyway. We'd get off at a station and get to work. It was too cold to walk very far from the station. "Northernmost Point. Latitude 45931'. Japan's Northernmost Point. To the east of this cape lies the Sea of Okhotsk. To the west lies the Sea of Japan. This is where the two seas meet. On a clear day, with unaided eyes, one can see Sakhalin, 27 miles away." I got some steamed buns. The sake buns here have real sake. They'll warm you up. I wonder if I'll ever be able to come back here. Why not? As long as we have money. - Is this really the tip of Japan? - Yes. It isn't Japan anymore on the other side of this sea. We've gone everywhere. There's nowhere left. Just outer space. Honey, let's get a real apartment and settle down. Give me an honest answer. We've made a lot of money. You think 600,000 yen is a lot? If we rent an apartment and buy furniture, it'll be gone in three months. You can get a job. What are you saying? I'm not well! You knew that from the start. I wish Japan was bigger. Wait! Stop! We've done it for the past two days. We should lay low for five or six days. I'll get a good hotel. We'll call in some geisha. Look! We'll ruin everything if we keep going. We have to give this up sooner or later. Let's just wait three months and let the dust settle. It'll work, even if we have to start over in Kyushu. I've had enough. I want it to be over for good. That's why I'm working like crazy now. What are you doing? All right! We can stop for now. We can't risk getting caught, so we'll split up for a while. I'll do what you want. - Fine, as long as you mean it. - I'll take the boy with me. - What? - You take the baby. You think you can fool me that easily? Fool you? It's better this way. Bitch! God knows the boy and I are the ones doing the work. We can do it by ourselves. - Shut up! - How old are you? - Ten. - Where were you born? - Osaka. Whose child are you? You're mine, aren't you? I'm your father. What are you doing? SUD! Mama, let's go. You little shit! You bribed him? You bribed the kid with a watch? Pick it up. What? You little brat! Peewee! Let's get out of here! SUD! Hurry! Up here! You little brat! Come here and sit down! I died once already, in the war. Bullets went through my left arm and collarbone. You two say you're doing the work, but you've never even broken an arm! Did you ever once feel you were facing death? You get bumped by a slow-moving car and start bawling. You think I should be grateful for that? You wanna break up me and my wife and pretend I'm not your dad? Neither of you knows the terror of war. Some guy's taking a shit, and the next minute his head's blown off. I've seen it. I've seen people die with my own eyes! I didn't just see it- it was like I died myself! And you two have the nerve to say I'm not good for anything? - That's all irrelevant - - Idiot! It isn't! How would you two live with yourselves if you left a husband and father like me? Son! You think you could go on living after that? She died. In the accident earlier? I might have killed her. Idiot! It doesn't matter! - What the hell is this crap? - You jerk! What do you think you're doing? You demon! You're inhuman! Why didn't you die in the war? You call yourself a father and husband? You left the baby and ran away! You were happy when the boy really got hurt! You're a monster! You bitch! Go on, keep hitting me! Kill me, the boy, the baby! I will! I'll kill you all! You wanna strangle me? Fine. But even a thug like you wouldn't kill my unborn baby. Shut up, goddamn it! What's going on in here? Uh... it's nothing. - Shall I look after the baby? - No, it's all right. I should just die. It's better that way. Good-bye, Papa. Good-bye, Mama. Brother! Brother! Go back in. You can't come with me. Brother! Brother! Go back. You can't come with me. I'm going where no one but me can go. Brother! It's all right. Don't cry. Peewee, you know what that is? That's no ordinary snowman. It's an alien. Alien... That's right. Watch this. Even you can understand now, right? That alien came from the Andromeda nebula. Andromeda... He's a cosmic messenger of justice... who's come to kill the evildoers, the villains of the world. He isn't afraid of monsters or demons, or trains, or cars. If he strikes them, they shatter. He never gets hurt. He never cries. He has no tears to cry. He has no parents. He's all alone. No mama, no papa. When he's really afraid, other aliens come from outer space and save him. I wanted to become... an alien like him. But I can't. I'm just an ordinary kid. I can't even die the right way. You worthless, piece-of-crap alien! Is this Sunday? Everyone is getting ready for Christmas. The day Christ died? No, the day he was born, 1966 years ago. We stopped working after that. We went back to Kochi, and then to Osaka. Now we live in a real house. A Japanese-style house with Western plumbing. COUPLE FAKES ACCIDENTS WITH OWN CHILD EXTORT OVER 400,000 YEN AS MANY AS 31 CASES IN 17 PREFECTURES FEMALE SUSPECT BORN IN OSAKA EXTORTIONISTS IDENTIFIED THROUGH MATCHED PHOTOS POLICE EXPAND SEARCH NATIONWIDE The parents used their child to stage accidents and extort money from drivers in San'in, Kanto, and Hokkaido between October and December. The National Police Agency counts 16 cases, involving payments of 747,200 yen. The suspects are a middle-aged couple with a boy and a baby. The presumed father is Takeo Omura, 45, from Kochi, unemployed, with one prior conviction and three other offenses. He and his accomplice have been wanted by Gunma police since December 20. As the boy is injured and his life is considered at risk, the National Police Agency has ordered a nationwide manhunt. Are you Takeko Taniguchi? You know why I'm here. You should never have used the kid. Papa, run! You got hit by a lot of cars, huh? Did your father tell you to do that? Your mother? I love my mother. - When did you come to Osaka? - I don't remember. You went all over Japan, huh? No. I've never even been on a train. Don't lie to me. People shouldn't lie. Look, that's you in the photo. You have a hat on. That's a space alien. It must have hurt, getting hit like that. I've never been hit by a car. Then what's that scar on your elbow? I had a blister there. Why are you examining me? Nobody asked you to. The police asked me to. I have to treat you if you're badly hurt. I'm not hurt. If your wounds get worse, I might have to cut off a leg or an arm. Cut'em off if you have to. Takeo Omura, born in 1922 in Yoshidamura in Kochi. Third child of six in a family of farmers and fishermen. The father passed away when Omura was five. Moved to Osaka at age 17.

Yeah, I went to Hokkaido. THE END
