I hope he bangs his head at some point. Ra... Ra... Raccoon's balls are swinging even if there's no breeze. A cute baby raccoon sees this, grabs its stomach and goes, 'Wahaha!' You're persistent! - You're too cute for them. - I don't like persistent guys. I have a good offer for you. - Do you come here often? - Yeah, sometimes. Wanna come with me? - Where to? - I want to smoke some weed. - That stuff? - Why not? I know a good weed guy. Do you smoke weed often? When I have money. It makes me feel so good. - Which way? - Tum right there. Can we buy here? Nobody watches us here, so we can do whatever. What? What's funny? You're...? Stop it! Let's go! Bitch! Be a good boy. That all? Your approach made trapping you even easier. I've no money to give you. Stop fucking with us! - Bitch! - Bastard. Idiot! It hurts! So what do you want to do? It doesn't really matter. Looks good. Hey, Sis! Working here seems fun! Right, Sis? How much is this? Wait a minute! Yuri! Hey! Hum! Up! Hey! Give them back! - What you stole. - What? We know! - Stop fucking with us! - What are you doing? - Bitch! - Stop it! - You have guts! - I told you to stop! Let go! Let me go! - Let's go! - You deserve it! - That was so cool! - How pathetic! Wait! Give them to us! What you stole from them. What are you talking about? Don't raise your voice! It's for your health. - Run! - Bitch! I know a good place for you. Get! Hideo! I brought her! What is this? Don't waste your breath. Hideo! What's wrong? Pay her back for what she did last night! I will! Everyone! Please get out. Fine. What you did was some lowdown shit. Idiot! Don't come any closer! I'll stab you if you come any closer! I swear! Where is Mr. Tanabe? Brother! What's up with you all of a sudden? Mr. Tanabe! She's gone! Mako is gone! Mako? What's the situation? Tell me. I found her! I found Mako! Where? Where? - Welcome. - Mako! What happened? - We've been looking for you! - Did they take you to their crib? - What happened? - Welcome. Mako! What, even you? Nothing happened! They can't take me anywhere. Don't worry. Okay then... They're no big deal. But they really piss me off! I'll beat them up next time they're hanging around. That's enough. Miss! One ochazuke for me. - Me too. - Me too. Get out! What are you doing?! - Get out! - Hey! Are you daring us again? Bastard! - Stop fucking with us, bitch! - You stop fucking with us, bastard! - What are you doing? - Hey! Go home now! If you report this to the police, they'll shut the bar down tomorrow. Hey! Enough! - What are you doing? - Asshole! I got it! Don't touch me! Get out! You guys... It's not good to make a scene like that in there. As of now, don't hang out in this area or this bar. Are we clear? Wait! Why can't we go in the bar? Whatever we do is up to us. We don't take orders from you. Toru! Shit... I tried to be nice. Teach them a lesson! - Yoji! Yoji! - Yoji! Are you okay? Don't ever try something like this again! - Alright. - Get lost! - Hurry. - Shit! Shit! Okay, get inside, everyone! Get in! Drink! It'll ease the pain. With that injury, you might not be able to drive again. No way! Because of this scratch? No way! Forgive me! It was because of me... Idiot! They have yakuza backing. Listen! I won't back down like this! I know! Youngsters, who are the foundation of this country, should not live their lives like this! We are asking you to act for the sake of education and the politics of Japan! We are requesting action by the government of Japan and to know what the government is about. Everything you know comes from pre-war education... Keep the change. Please follow me. Be careful. It's too dark. Mister, hurry up! Here they are. Which one do you want? - I want her. - She is sold! Me first then. Wait a sec. She is for you. Good! Let's go together! She's kind of soft in the head but customers keep coming for her after the experience. She'll be good for you. This must be your first time here! It's alright! What is it? - Do you want to run away from here? - What's wrong? No matter how much you earn, they take a big cut in the end. You can't stay here forever. But the guys downstairs are watching us! I will take care of it. Bring other girls, too. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Hun?! Wait here, then! What?! - Why'd you have to... - Idiot! What's your problem? Get dressed! Wait! You too! Hurry up if you want to run away from here! - It won't work! She likes this job. - Someone! Help me! Stay here if you don't want to get hurt. He said we could run away from here! Make it quick! Get down here! Quiet! Be quiet! - Scary! - Be quiet! - Is it okay? - It's fine! It's fine! It's scary! ' Be Careful! Hurry up! Idiot! Don't make any noise! Quiet! Good! Go! Run quietly! - Go! - Hurry! - Hey! The ladder! - Shit! Sabu! Just leave it! - But... - It's fine, just hurry! What's with you? Run! - I don't want to go anywhere! - Okay, just hurry! - I like it here! - Whatever! Hun?! Idiots! You got tricked by those bastards! How can I ever let you manage this area again? Forgive us please. They are trying to take our girls away. We can't let them threaten our business! Take care of the situation immediately! Understood. Tanabe! To get the girls back, you need to use your sister. - Okay? - Understood. - Yuri! - Yuri! - Do you know Sari in Shinjuku? - Sari? That guy's girlfriend. Ah, the chubby one with long hair? She died... yesterday... Why? She did it five times while pregnant and dropped dead! - How passionate! - Must've been so good! - Sis, can you do it for me? - Give me the paper. Thank you. Look at me! What is this? - Cute. - Let's go. Sanae! Where is Mako? Do you know where the guys are? How can we know? I haven't seen them around in a while. - Right? - Yes. What's up? The girls in our territory ran away with them. Wow, they are good. Idiot! You guys started this mess! It's not that we wanted to. The clan is even discussing the option to use you guys for our business. You can't be serious! Why us? You need to find them! Wherever they are! - Brother! - What? Stop hanging out here. You need to find them too! Okay? Yoji! The Yasuoka clan is looking for you. Why? You guys snatched the clan': girls, right? So? You didn't tell them about us? - No. - Why? Do you hate me? No, I like you. Then why didn't you fuck me the other day? I wanted to, but not that way. You were scared, right? You didn't do it because you were scared. I wasn't scared. Idiot! Don't pretend to be a tough guy. Idiot! - I told you that I like you! - I like you too. Idiot! I'm not the one who is an idiot! Idiot! A smoke? Do you always smoke? We deliver this sometimes. - Delivery? - The Yasuoka clan is handling the business. That's right. You told me you didn't smoke. Does the Yasuoka clan even have a marijuana business? They do... whatever makes them money... That's right. I have a good idea. You guys can snatch the weed. I'll tell you the location. - But you... - What? You guys want to take down the Yasuoka clan, don't you? But why would you do that? Interesting, isn't it? I want you guys to win. I hate the Yasuoka clan. They always say that they got our back. In reality, they only think about how to use us. My brother will be mad at me. But my brother only cares about the clan anyway. I envy you guys. Hideo! Let's bring all of the weed here! Let's do it! I want to see their surprised faces! But can we really trust that information? No doubt! Why? Mako is the sister of the yakuza. The info is correct. I heard about it once at the clan's office. Yoji! Wanna do it? The problem is the buyer. We can worry about that once we have it in our hands. Hotel... Come on... - Give us the weed! - We don't have that kind of thing! You're supposed to bring them to the Yasuoka clan. We already know. - Who are you? - Doesn't matter! Give it to me! - I found it! - Alright! Hideo! How should I know? You didn't tell anyone about the weed, did you? No. What happened anyway? They snatched it. I can't believe you doubted me. There's no way I'd tell them about that. Then everything's fine. But we'd be in big trouble if you ever leaked anything to them. If I did, what would you do? What did you just say? I said if I. You care more about the clan than me. You'd take me in, right? Idiot! Am I right? - Mako! You... - I said if. Stop making jokes like that. Mako! See you. The Yasuoka clan summoned all of us to the office. Mr. Tanabe! What is this about? Not sure. Let's go anyway. Thank you very much. Do you know why you were summoned? Don't you have a clue? - We don't have any idea! - How could we know? - Explain it to us! - She's right! Did you tell anyone about the marijuana? What is this? Go! What are you doing? Since your tongues won't tell us the truth, we are asking your bodies about it. I never thought the Yasuoka guys would do something as dirty as this. - Hey! Get on it. - No! - No! - You bitch! Hey, check it out! What are you doing? Slop! Nobody knows anything I'm the one who told them! I told them! Mako! Where is their crib? I don't know. I really don't know! Tanabe! Your sister's problem is your problem. Cut off your finger. If your sister told us the truth, I would waive the punishment. Doesn't seem that way though. I will tell you! I will tell you everything! Please forgive everyone! How about 4,000 per gram? I can't make a deal like that with a newbie like you. The price won't go down even a yen. If you offer a cheaper price, I will buy exclusively from you. How much do you offer? They are not here. Did you give us false information? I told you the truth. They were really here. - I didn't lie. - Who are you guys? Hey! Where are the kids? No idea. If you hide something, it won't be good for you. Who are you guys? I want to drop by somewhere. Not that girl. The Yasuoka clan must be looking for us as we speak. That's why I'm worried about her. What if they are harassed by the clan? You're so naive. I don't think she told them about us. I just want to let her know I'm okay. Fine. But you shouldn't tell anyone about our new crib, not even the girl. Deal. Hey! Where is Mako? She went out to find you - with the Yasuoka clan. Because of you, we were in big trouble. Come to the Yasuoka clan with us! It's okay, Sanae! Stop wandering around. Leave right now! Yuri! The clan doesn't care about anyone, including them and us. We don't have to care about them. Mako! Hideo! Hey! Let's go! Mako! Don't touch me! Hey! Move! Hey! Toru! Good day, sir! - Take the rope off. - Yes, sir! You must be Toru. Actually, I'm okay with letting you manage the marijuana business if you're really interested. Taking down you guys is a very simple job for us. We can control you in any way we want. We can simply keep you in this dark room forever. But that would benefit no one. It seems you guys have a profitable buyer. Help us a bit. If you can give us more proceeds, we won't complain about that. Just take care of the other guys. Understood? That's all I wanted to say. Good day, sir. - Good day, sir. - Good day, sir. Good day, ma'am. What's up? Boss said he would forgive you this time since you told us the truth. That's all. Go home. - Hey! - Yes, sir. Did Hideo cut himself? Did he? Is he bleeding? Not your business. Forget about them. Let me see him. Let me see Hideo! Idiot! That's enough! Mako! If you keep hanging out with them, the clan will not forgive you again. If you don't want to become a call girl, don't ever hang out with them again. Understood? Hey! How did it go? Sis, it's so boring. There's nothing interesting going on. I agree. It's boring... - Wanna play a game? - That boring too. Open! Open up please! Please let me out! Toru! Hideo! There's no other way. I can't stay here forever! Open! Open! Let me out, please! Toru! Are you going to do 'what the guy wants? Open up, please! Please let me out! Toru! You betrayed us... Open! Open up, please! Please let me out! Somebody, come help me! Let me out, please! Hideo! You took so long! What happened? Where's Toru? The Yasuoka clan caught us. What? I thought we were in big trouble. That's why I came down here to talk to you. I see... You heard the story from Hideo, right? If you want to join the clan, I don't even have to answer. Toru! You won't betray us! Right? Tell me to my face! Toru! I don't think you'll betray us. Listen carefully. Otherwise, all of us will... All of us?! Hideo! Sabu! Let's go! You must know better than anyone what the yakuza is about! If you and I make a team, we will earn a lot of money. I don't want to earn money by joining those bastards! Let's go! Toru! Let's go! Toru! Hideo! Hey! Would you take us with you? Now we know the Yasuoka clan's real face. What about the others? They are scared of the clan. You will forgive Mako, right? There was no other way than telling them about you guys. Mako! Hey! Let's drink already! - What are you doing? - Yoji! A candle light party is how Toru would do it. I hate it! Everyone! Let's drink! I've been waiting! Give me one! This! No, a big one is better! Ouch! It's hot! What is this? We can't eat this because of the candle. - No way! - It's burned. Would your brother be okay with this? That's his business. This is my business. They will be very mad if they find out that you ran away with us. It won't be easy. The clan won't stop there and do nothing. There's no other way. They'll come to take you. What are you going to do then? Are you going to let me go? Idiot! Never! Sabu! I'm drunk! What? I told you I don't like drunk girls. I know a guy who deals with marijuana at a bar in Yokohama. - Who? - An American. Compared with him, the buyer of the Yasuoka clan is nothing. Can you find him? I stayed at his flat once. I ended up running away from it though. This is it. Tell me, Toru. Where is their crib? Wait! Will you hurt them? Give me one more chance... I'm the one handling the situation. Tanabe! Are things going alright? This is your last chance as well. If you can't even find your own sister, the clan won't spare you. Yes, sir. How about you, Toru? You already broke up with your mates. Why are you trying to defend them? Go! He did it! I'm hungry. I'll eat the butter. Are they still shopping? They'll be back soon. Brother! There she is! Wait! Wait! - Is this the place? - Yes. Find the others! - Kojima! - Yes, sir! - Matsuda! - What are you doing? - Be a good girl! - Wait! The Yasuoka clan! They must've caught Okazu! If the guys come back now, all of us will be in big trouble. Let's separate and tell them. There she is! Wait! Bitch! Bitch! Let me go! Brother! We got another one. - Nana! - Okazu! Mr. Tanabe! We can't find the others! Is that so? Where are the others? - They aren't here! - Bitch! - Where's Mako? - I don't know! Every single one of them is just a kid. Hey! Apparently, you don't understand what will happen if you keep challenging us. Teach their bodies a lesson. They don't seem to know the location of the others. Get on it! Stop it! Don't run! Get up! Get up! Stop resisting! Let me go! Are you going to wait here? - We'll get caught. - I'll do what I can. If they catch me, so be it. Understood. Hurry! Wait! Wait, bitch! Wait! Mako! I can protect you from them! Come with me! - No! - Mako! Mako! Mako! Nana. l. Let's find them! - Harumi! - Nana! Nana! Nana... Harumi! Okazu! What happened? Tell me what happened! - Shit! - Harumi! Where is Mako? What happened to Mako? It's unfortunate that you didn't say good-bye to Hideo. Better that way. He didn't have to see that bastard': face. It's better that way. Mako! He's not as sincere as you think. - He's playing you. - Don't touch me. I won't do anything from now on. Idiot! Don't you understand what I'm saying? What is this? I can't win... You're doing good... Here you go. Tanabe! What's up? You haven't had a sip. Sony. I'm leaving now. Enjoy. Hey! We're leaving as well! Are you already leaving? Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you. Why don't we go to Hiromi': bar? Brother... - Bitch! - Okazu! I've been looking for you. You guys need to reconsider! This is like killing yourself! If you want to join, I can still negotiate with the clan on your behalf. We can run the marijuana business together. Right? Have you been looking for us just for that? Yoji! Please understand what I'm saying! It's no use talking to me. Nana died. Harumi and Okaze got arrested. There is no way for both of us to go back. Yoji! Wait! Let me go! Hideo! Sabu! Wait a sec! He's tailing us! Hideo! Hideo! Hideo... Sabu... Toru! Was it an accident? Is it true that Hideo had an accident? Yes... It was an accident. Mr. Tanabe! Mako is acting weird! She smokes weed all day. I can't help her anymore. She's been acting weird ever since that guy died. Mako! Mako! - Hey! What's up? - Get lost! Mako! Did you really love him? He's dead. There's nothing you can do. This isn't you. Mako! He was killed. Hideo was killed by someone! Mako! Mako! That's enough! No! No! No! I didn't know you loved him that much. Had I known, I wouldn't have let it happen. So, what now? They already killed him. Mako! Brother! - Lend me your knife! - Don't be stupid! I'll end the bastard who killed Hideo! Mako! Don't be stupid! I can even kill you, my own brother! Mako! Give it to me... Give it to your brother... Give it to me... Mako! Hideo was killed! Mako... Give it to me! Mako! You're a good girl! Give it back to me! Mako! Mako! Mako! Brother! Mako... I wanted to make you happy... - One day... - Brother! Mako... Stop doing stupid shit. Nobody will cover for you this time... Got it? Are you going to introduce a new buyer? Please let me do it! I will show you what I can do! Give it a try. If it goes well, we can talk again. Good day, sir. Yasuoka Company. Yasuoka Company. Yokohama Asahi Residence. Mako! Mako! Mako! Don't touch her! Don't touch Mako! How annoying... Go away, all of you! How annoying... The End
