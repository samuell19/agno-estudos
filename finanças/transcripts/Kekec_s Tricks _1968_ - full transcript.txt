KEKCEVE UKANE (Kekec's Tricks) Directed by Screenplay by Photography Music by You're always shooting animals! You never leave the shepherds in peace and that is why they don't like to take their herds up into the mountain. Now be quiet and listen to what our elected judge Vitranc has to tell you! All clever people and all the animals follow his rules. Remember, Bedanc, what I'm going to tell you now: if I catch you just once again poaching game or learn that you have inflicted any damage on the people in the mountain or spoilt their joy and peace... We will shut you up in a rocky ravine, so you'll know. I'm tired, Brincelj. Oh, I'll play a little song for you and it will make you feel better and you will dream sweet dreams. Hey, why are you so fidgety, my fleecy dears? Is it not a good pasture? No? Well, let's try and find a better one. Look, Brincelj remembered me. Brincelj... Brincelj... Do you hear? What? Don't you really hear anything...? Kekec. Do you thing it's really Kekec? And who else could it be? Let's go...! He wanted to play a trick on us again. Kekeeeeeec! Is it you or isn't it? But wait... And if it isn't Kekec, what then...? Of course it is Kekec. And how do you know...? I know it is. And what will happen if this is Bedanc playing flute? To entice us? You're afraid, aren't you? Who? Me? Wouldn't it be better if we went back? And allow Kekec to laugh at us. He is somewhere near. Aha, Brincelj... so here's your hiding place. You've lost your voice, haven't you? And there at Vitranc's your tongue worked as if it had been greased, when you blackened me. I didn't blacken you. Shut up. "I didn't blacken you"... and you didn't spoil my traps either, or did you? Come one, get going. And be quick. Where am I going? With me, come on! With you? And why? You'll see! I will see nothing at all and I am not going to go anywhere! Open... and show yourself, do you hear me! Have you thought it over? Better get out immediately, or hits will finish up nastily! Wait, just wait a bit. I'll get you out your hiding place. H, you tried to smoke me out... A: aaaa! Wait, just wait... You reminded me very well how to drive you out... Brincelj, Brincelj, are you going to come out now, or aren't you? Kekec... Have you gone out of your wits? What's wrong, Rozle? Hey, you're not asleep in broad daylight, are you? Rozle, Mojca, open the door! Hey! Who's that, hey! Oh, that's you. I thought it was Bedanc sneaking round the house. Who? Oh, Kekec, do you know what's happened? Poor Brincelj! We must save him? Who? Who, Brincelj! Just the two of us? The two of us. How? We'll think something out. We don't even know where Bedanc took him. To his own house, where else? Do you know where this is? Vitranc knows surely! Of course, you must find Vitranc, he'll help you! Let's set off immediately. We must find Vltranc's mountain, you can see it from all around. But Vitranc's mountain is high... and far... Then let's start at once. There, that's Vitranc's peak. But wait, there is nothing there! Leave me alone! You know what, let's have a little rest. Have you seen him? Who? Bedanc. Haven't you? Not me, and you haven't either! And who was shooting hey? Some huntsman, surely. Hey, Rozle, for Heaven's sake, wait! Are you out of your senses? Rozle, Rozle, are you still alive? I don't know... Where are we? In the abyss. In the abyss! What are we going to do? We'll try the round about way. And up again? To Vitranc. To Vitranc? We're not going to abandon Brincelj in trouble, Surely? Have they already found Vitranc, they have, they haven't, yes, no, yes, no... I'm not going to move any further, uh! Uh! I'm so thirsty that I could drink a whole bucket of milk! Look there are shepherds over there! But there isn't a living soul anywhere. Then these must be wood-cutters or charcoal burners. I'll go down, and you do as you like! Kekec, Kekec... Oh, my dear Kekec, get me out of this miserable hole! Kekec, Kekec, help! You help too! What are you staring at the ceiling for! Thank you for coming, boys! Thank you for coming. I knew you wouldn't let me alone in the trouble. Wait, I'll do it, and you hold on up there! Come on, boys, quicker, quicker, quicker, quicker! Where's the key? How do I know, I don't know anything! And how did you two come here? We are shepherds. Look, look. Shepherds, you say! You're not going to take Brincelj to pasture, are you? We've lost our way... I can see that... I see that! We didn't know it was your house. You'll find that out now. Look out, over there... A high mountain peak disperses the darkness and glitters like fire. All that is bad, evil and wicked disappears in the abyss. Then all the word become pure, safe. Yes, yes, hm. Rozle, Rozle! We've gone to sleep again. Come, wake up! It cuckooed three times, it brought luck... Rozle, Kekec... Rozle, Kekec... 277, 278, 279, 280, 281. Of what? Of chamois! 197,198,199... What of 199... Foxes, 199 foxes. 333, 334, 335, 336 roe deer and their males, my dear Brincelj... And you've shot all of them? All of them. And why? Why? You fool, for their fur! And what will you do with the fur? I'll sell it. Sell? Sell... I'll be rich. Haven't you enough of them? Not yet! I'll skin whatever is alive up there in the mountain. Oh, poor deer... Oh, poor chamois... Poor foxes... And hares... Shut up, what are you squealing about! Vitranc will not allow it! You're not going to tell tales on me any longer, my dear Brincelj. And when I have finished with all this, I'll disappear over nine mountains... And what will happen to us? I'll take you with me, ha, ha, scoundrels, ha, ha! Rozle! Rozle! Kekec! Mojca! Mojca! You're not afraid of anybody, are you, Kekec? Not even Bedanc, are you? And you'll help Rozle if Bedanc leaves him in the mountains, Rozle is so afraid of him, isn't he, he is afraid of him. I am not afraid of him at all, not at all... I would beat him all black and blue so that he would Fool! Play! Into the house! Make it livelier and louder. Still wilder and gayer! Come on! Come on! Well, come on, aaaa... This is how a flute should be played, you know! And not that squeaking cooing of yours. I'll teach you... Here... Here... here... here... You won't get anything, nothing at all, until you improve. You learn, and you work! Rozle! Rozle! Kekec! Oh, but Bedanc will beat him black and blue. Rozle! Yes, Brincelj? "Go on wilder, gayer!" how can I play with joy when I am locked in like a wild animal! Oh yes, I used to play gay songs, yes, yes, but then I was free as a little bird on the tree, yes, yes. You did, too, Brincelj, that's true... Do you know what freedom is? As if I wouldn't... Real freedom? What is real freedom? You play when you wish, for whom you wish, as much as you wish, yes, yes. This is what my freedom was like, but now it is over and done with. Yes, our freedom has come to an end, for ever. For ever... Rozle, Mojca... Oh, you were left alone, it means something is wrong again. I'll search the mountain and find that scoundrel... What are you shouting at, you thief! I'll catch a deer or a bear in the pit, and you, I'll catch you in a trap and pluck those magpie feathers of yours and then you can cry as long as you want. Rozle... Brincelj! Stop you scoundrels... I'll show to you... So you will always remember me... Help me, boys, to get out of here... Save me, I'll die of this horror... Now you know what the poor deer felt in your traps. And hares... and foxes... and bears... And how I felt in your cage, yes you know... But I only joked a little with you... I almost died for hunger in your house! You set Brincelj's little hut on fire! You intended to destroy all the animals! I'll die of hunger and thirst... You'll build a new hut for Brincelj! I will. You give your word that you will no longer persecute and frighten the shepherds... I swear... That you will no longer shoot game... I won't! Boys... Boys, don't leave me alone... Oh, are you playing a trick on me? Rozle! Kekec! I have heard everything, Bedanc! And remember, you must keep all your promises or else you will... Cast
