And pure shit on a good day. (whispers) Goddamn it. (Willie) Yeah, I guess there have been a few dull bright spots here and there. (whispers) Fuck it. Like a piece of ass who didn't look me in the eye or wanna show me pictures of her fucking vacation. Or a good drunk when I didn't choke on my own vomit. - Ah! - I even almost had a friend once. Sure, he was a mouth-breathing, snot dripping 8-year-old who couldn't find his fat ass with both hands, but he was clueless enough to think I wasn't the worthless piece of shit everybody else thinks I am. Including me. I also found what was the closest thing I ever had to an actual girlfriend. She liked the job I had at the time, especially while I was in uniform. Sounds like a happy ending, don't it? - But, you see... - (unzips pants) ...you can only puke in somebody's lap so many times before the romance takes a shit. And the kid, he still creeps around every now and then and I still chase him off For his own good. So you see, happy endings are bullshit. Actually, there aren't such things as endings at all, because when some shit gets over with, some other whole thing starts that sucks ass. Merry fucking Christmas.

It's me, Thurman. - (Willie gagging) Willie, what are you doing? Did you get yourself stuck up there? - (grunts) - (groans) Okay, I'll go. But this package came to my house for you, Willie. There's a lot of money in it. And a phone. And a note. What? Chair! - Chair? - Chair! Chair. Give me the goddamn chair. - Willie, you fell. - (Willie groans) Goddamn. Are you a complete fucking retard? No. The Hungry Hoagies people tested me. I'm top of the spectrum. So they made me a full-time sandwich consultant. - Well, I'm glad you followed your passion. - What's that smell? Is the oven on? Are you making Hot Pockets? We do hot sandwiches at Hungry Hoagies now. But I always burn my hand getting them out of oven. Darlene says I should put butter on my hand, but that's stupid. We only put butter on food. Hand isn't food. ♪ Merry Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ Christmas everywhere ♪ ♪ Merry Merry Christmas ♪ I know we left on bad terms. But you gotta understand, it was only business. We were partners. And I broke that sacred bond. It's not an excuse. But Lois got all up in my kitchen. Crazy bitch had me all turned around with her magical Laotian pussy. - Don't blame it on the snapper. - I was pussy-blind. I'm ashamed. You tried to murder me, you little prick. Remember that? And not with some little nubbin-dick gun, but with adult man-sized bullets. - And now I'm here to make it up to you. - Why are you even out of the joint anyway? Some pity case on account of you're a genetic defect? You know, they used to sterilize guys like you. Keep the world from becoming some Negro Land of Oz. Shut the fuck up! Early release. Overcrowding. Well, it must've been packed to the gills if they couldn't cram your three-foot ass in there. We got a job, Willie. That two grand is just to show I'm serious. Can you still crack a safe? Or did you get carpal tunnel from jacking off? - I can crack just fine, thanks. - I'm talking millions this time. - Where at? - Chi-Town. I thought you were all done with the gooks. Chicago, you racist moron fuck! I got an associate out there who has got this thing all lined up. - What associate? - I'm not at liberty to disclose just yet. But they know your work. And they want to bring us in and put us up in some fine-ass metropolitan digs and finance the whole operation. You're outta your fucking skull. What are you gonna do? Try and kill yourself again? That's none of your goddamn business what I do. Don't let the door hit you in the ass. Or I won't let it hit me in the ass. Whatever the fuck it is. Did you even score once while I was away? I'm talking two mil here. That's a lot of fat-ass bitches and whiskey. Fuck you. Why do you have to go so soon? We just got back together. Cut that shit out. We're not back together. Guess you don't know what today is. (sighs) I don't even know what fucking year it is, kid. It's my birthday. - Today is your fucking birthday? - Uh-huh. I'm 21 . Officially a man. Goddamn. You're 21 already. That's creepy. - Are you still gonna pop my cherry? - Am I gonna what? No! Fuck no! But you said that when I was 21 that you'd pop my cherry. I said I'd get it done by somebody else. Besides that, I'm a fucking guy. You didn't turn funny, did you? Am I funny? So you haven't done it with anybody yet. Not a man or a woman or an animal or anything. No, I waited for you. - But surely, you jerked off or... - You mean masturbate, don't you? Well, if you wanna be scientific, yeah, I guess so. My friend Ronnie says, it's when you play with your wiener and think about your mother. I did it once, but it felt weird. She's in heaven with God, you know. Watching me. (car honking) Okay, so here's how it's gonna go down. He's already asked me where his cherry is. So you could tell him to put his dick in your purse and he wouldn't know any fucking difference. It's gonna be the easiest 20 bucks you ever made. Twenty bucks? (scoffs) You must be high on some strong shit, Willie. A hundred. Or I'm gonna carry my ass outta this old piece of a room right now. All right. Fifty, or I'll just go get your mother. Sixty. All right. And nothing up my ass. You done took all that, Willie. (softly) Okay. Well, let's get to it. I gotta pick up my grandson from ballet. - Can I fix you a sandwich? - (chuckles) No. - I got your sandwich, baby. - Willie, I made you a sandwich. I ain't sticking around. Just give it to Opal after. Now, listen, here's how it works. She's gonna pull her rig off. And she's gonna get on all fours. Now, you stand behind her and drop your rig. Then, you're gonna see something that looks like some kind of Japanese food. It ain't, so don't eat it. That's the bulls-eye. Then you just start tugging on your little soldier. Wait till he gets to attention, then poke him in there. Keep poking it in there till he spits up. (Willie) You're gonna need a raincoat. She'll have one, so don't worry about that. As soon as you're done, run to the bathroom, wash your crotch. That way, you don't wake up wondering why you got oatmeal in your carpet. Breathe through your mouth so that you don't puke. Shouldn't be a problem for you. You got it? - (whispers) You got 60 bucks? - No. - What you got? - I have $20. Keep it down. - (whispers) I have 20. - Give it to her after. (car honking) - Later, Opal. - Mm-hmm. Come on, baby. Come on. Get a bite of this pumpernickel bread. Damn it, Willie. Hurry up! We're gonna miss our train. You see me walking backwards, asshole? I'm coming. (Opal) Kid, get over here and take your pants off. (Thurman) No!

Randall sounds Irish. I want something whiter. I'm Davis, you're Cook. End of fucking story. You got one job this time. Open a safe. Till then, just keep your drunken deviant fucking mouth shut. You know what you need? You need some pussy. I'll see if I can find you a cat somewhere. Put that shit away. (Willie) "Giving City Foundation. Bringing food and shelter to those in need." Hold the fucking phone. I traveled all the way across the country to rob a goddamn charity? Why? You got a problem with that? Yeah, you damn right I got a problem with it. No way these assholes have 2 million bucks. Will you keep it down, man. Moron. (softly) I don't know. ("Joy to the World" playing) - I see they made you some chairs already. - Fuck you. He's Cook. I'm Davis. We're here for the orientation. Empty your pockets. Place any metal items in the tray. (thudding) - (sloshes) - What's that? - Cough medicine. - Let me see that. (guard sniffs) That's a level three contraband. I'm gonna have to compensate that. The fuck you are. All right, big shot. You can stay out here with your GD flask. - We'll get it on the way out. - Gina! (guard) Show these boys to the line-up. They're late. Meeting started ten minutes ago. But I think I can sneak you guys in. Come on. ("Joy to the World" playing) - Hey, Diane! I got two more. - Come on in, fellas. - Goddamn. - (Marcus) That's Diane Hastings. She and her husband run the joint. (Diane) So like I was saying, finish filling out these forms and you can drop them off at the front desk, please. And then, you can go to the common room and pick up your uniforms. I bet that pussy got lips like an orangutan. - Excuse me, Mr... - Um, Cook. Randall Cook. - What's up? - Have you been drinking? Uh, I don't know. Some vodka... Because we don't allow alcohol or drugs of any kind at Giving City. Why's that? You may not be aware of this, Mr. Cook, but we're a charity. When you walk out those doors, you're representing us. - So please try and make us look good. - Oh, we'll make you look great. - (Marcus) Promise. - Yeah. (Willie) Mmm. A hard-on? (Marcus) You sick fuck. I'm the one that's been in prison for ten years. It's just a semi. Don't get all bent out of shape. Shut the fuck up. Ho, ho, ho. What's up, Santas? Hey, don't forget to remind people, if they don't have cash, they can always text in their donation. Give me some. Yeah. Hey, Di. Is it the midget that's fully proportional? - Or is it the dwarf? - (Diane whispers) Regent. - What? - You can't say that word. Hey, I'm gonna be home late again tonight. End-of-the-year accounting stuff. (scoffs) See you, babe. (woman) Thank you for helping us out again. Goddamn it. Sir? This way, please. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. Don't be touching me. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, whatever. Lying little fuck. You didn't tell me I'd have to get in the fucking suit again. I thought it would be a bonus. And I just wanna remind you of something. It's Christmas. A time for forgiveness. For family. I'm gonna remind you to fuck yourself. Ronald Davis. I was told you have a suit to fit me. Oh, yes. I have it right here. No. I need a Santa suit. This is an elf suit. I'm supposed to be a Santa. Oh, sorry about the confusion. That's all we have in your size. Uh, I do have a gingerbread man costume in a child's large, if you prefer. I guess there is a God. (woman) Step right up. Don't be shy. Shitstick! What's it been? Fifteen years? Twen... Well, one thing hasn't changed. You still hit like your fucking father. Fucking associate. No goddamn way. (chuckles) Not working with that poison bitch. Never again. You tricked me, you little shithole! You know fucking well you did. But I thought your dad was the one you hated. I hate him more than anything in the goddamn world! Except her. (siren wailing) (Marcus) Willie, stop! Willie! Okay, shitstick, just give me back the money for the train ticket, then we're square. Or you could do your dumb-ass self a favor, at least hear me out before you quit. (Sunny) Boy, you been selling your blood for booze? You look like a fucking albino scarecrow. Anyway, still good to see you. Uh, I can't say I feel the same. Goddamn, what a shit hole. - You conned me, you little prick. - (Marcus) Fuck you! Make yourselves at home. Bedroom's mine. That sofa folds out, so you guys can fight over that. I got chicken feet in the fridge. - So that's what smells like nut sack. - Boy, have a beer. - I even got minis for the midget. - Don't you ever fucking call me that. Hey, listen, little man, I don't speak politically correct, so if you got a problem with that, you take it up with the Lollipop Guild. Shut the hell up! Just break it down for him, Sunny. (Sunny) I'll break it down, all right. Giving City is a charity at 98 cents every dollar goes to this A-hole at the top. Regent Hastings. He takes in tens of thousands in donations, and he squirrels them away in an offshore account. - And how are you supposed to get it? - You mean, how are we supposed to get it? These little buckets here, they're filled with cash, up to the brim, every day. And then at night, they store that cash in the safe in Regent's office. And that's our target. Right here. Christmas Eve, they have a big charity concert. So while the kids and volunteers are all singing, the money's just sitting there, waiting for an armored transfer. That's our take window. Last year, the haul was almost 2 mil. - And how do you know all this shit? - Because I work there, dumb-ass. It's a part of my release from the joint. I've been there 3 months. Just did a little digging, a little Googling, a dry hand job to Isaac in Accounting. Boom. The concert's in five days. Meantime, we wear the suit, hit the pavement, we ring the bell, just like the rest of the volunteers. (Willie) All right. Well, it looks to me like you jackals already got the whole job figured out. What do you need me for? You can crack a fucking safe. Well, I'd like to say it's because I've missed you, my angel. But I got a touch of the Parkinson's and my hearing ain't what it used to be, so I'm gonna need you on the safe. Mmm. And when do you pull your little Roy Rogers pistol out on me again? I said I was sorry. You gotta let that shit go, Willie! No, I think I'll hang on to it. (Sunny) Oh, Christ. If I cut ties with every numbnut who tried to shoot me, I never would've gotten pregnant with you. (Sunny) Come on, boy. Be just like old times. - Old times? - Mm-hmm. You mean a living fucking nightmare? Why didn't you say so? I'm in. You gotta be shitting me. Good luck with the shakes. Willie, come on. Just give it a chance. (sighs) (door closes) (gate creaks) What, you don't trust your mother? Yeah, I trust her about as far as I can throw you. And I trust you about as far as I can throw her. Come on, Willie, I need this. And I know your sorry ass does too. Look at you, man. (coughs) Okay, if you want me in on this, it's you and me against her. You got it? She don't get a fucking nickel of what's in that safe. Get me? - We'll cut her out after the grab. - Damn right. (door closes) I knew you couldn't stay away. You always were your mama's boy. You just pipe down about the family stuff, okay? I'm in this for the dough, period. You get me? Well, it's starting to feel like Christmas. (bell ringing) Spare some change. Think about somebody besides your fucking selves. We gotta get eyes on that safe. Need to know the make. Now you're asking the right questions, shitstick. The trash chute's the best way in. I'm gonna need a hand getting into position. Recon. Good. We'll go tonight. Look at those cheeks! (chuckles) That's the ugliest fucking baby on the planet. - I guess the abortion didn't take. - (chuckles) Well, bless your heart. Cheap little fucker. Fucking dimes? Are you shitting me? - This ain't no strip joint. - What a fucking Sokes family. (Marcus) This is what happens when you screw your cousins. I taught this muskrat everything he knows. - Well, you don't know shit, then, do you? - Hey, listen, before we had midget... Excuse me... little people, we had Willie. He was my original elf. Remember those times, Willie? - There ain't enough booze to forget it. - (chuckles) Well, he'd get panic attacks. It was embarrassing. I had to make him stay outside when I was turning a trick or bowling. Wait a fucking minute, you were embarrassed? Isn't that kind of like the pot calling the other cot a fuck kettle, - or whatever it was? - What the fuck you say? (laughs) He's home-schooled. (Sunny laughing) I need a refill. - And another fucking corner. - Stop it, Willie. What? We're gonna steal this shit any fucking way. Who cares? But if we get fired, we got no access to the building. And if we got no access to the building, we got no access to the safe. And if we got no access to the safe, there's no reason for me to be standing out here, freezing my fucking nuts off. You mean your nuts haven't been scraped off because they're so low to the ground already? You know every time you're passed out, I lay them on your forehead and take a picture of it. I got a whole Instagram of that shit of me tea-bagging you. Four thousand followers and counting, motherfucker. Ha-ha! - (Sunny laughs) - (bell rings) Well, knock yourselves out. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Aw, come on, we're having family time here. He's always been too goddamn soft. Probably because he was born early. Hell, I didn't even know I'd given birth until I tripped over him. (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hi, Willie. Kid, how'd you get my number? (Thurman) The cherry pop lady gave it to me. Oh, Jesus. I cleaned your apartment, Willie. And I fed your insects. They're getting really big. (Thurman) Do you want me to get you a Christmas tree? - What? Why would I want a tree? - So we can spend Christmas together. (Willie over phone) I'm in fucking Chicago, kid. So you're not coming back for Christmas? - No, I'm not coming home for Christmas. - Chicago's in the Midwest, Willie. (Thurman) They have Hungry Hoagies there too. Well, good. I'll tell them you said hello, okay? Except I don't know anyone at that Hungry Hoagies. All right, listen, you gotta quit fucking calling me, okay? - You're burning my minutes. - But what if it's an emergency? Fine! If it's an emergency, call me, all right? Otherwise, leave me the fuck alone, okay? Okay. I'll only call if it's an emergency. - Bye. - (phone snaps) (Andy Williams' "It's the Most Beautiful Time of the Year" playing) ♪ It's the most wonderful time of the year ♪ (Willie) Okay, feed the kids. Come on. Give it up. You've seen them babies with beer bellies. Ho, ho! Come on, you got Jesus and the lambikins watching over you, checking their list twice. Here you go, lady, how about a little money? You know what, you'd better hope the orphans don't riot. They'll eat your fat ass right off the bat. You know, a lot of these kids don't got any arms and legs and shit. You're lucky. See, ma'am? Yours got all their parts. - (woman) There you go. - There you go. Thank you. See you later. - Damn. Mama ain't bad. - (Jolly Santa) Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho! My spot. You are standing on my spot. Really? That's funny, I don't see your fucking name on it anywhere. Well, in fairness, I did leave it unattended, but that's only because I had to run off to the little boys' room. What are you, a fucking game show host or something? - Dial it back a notch. - But now I am back. - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! - (bell rings) 'Tis the season of giving! And if you don't have cash, you can always text XMAS 999... Bullshit. No fucking way. Fucking cash only. - Ten dollars or more. - Okay. - Hundreds are better. What? - (speaks indistinctly) I am going to have to ask you to watch your language when you're representing the suit. And I'm going to have to ask you to suck my fucking dick. I'm warning you. Nothing and no one is getting in the way of me spreading my joy! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! You know what, I think you're some kind of pervert and you're afraid I'm muscling in on your fucking fondle territory. - That's what I think. - I see what's going on here. Yes, I see. - You are hurting inside. - Is that right? And there's only one thing that can change that. - Yeah? What's that? - A hug. - Are you out of your goddamn mind? - A hug from Santa! No, I don't need no fucking hug from Santa. - Let go of me, motherfucker. - Melt all that stress away! Would you cool it, pal? You're scaring all the kids away. You know what I mean? - You are a fucking pedophile! - (grunts) (grunts) - Let go of me. - (Jolly Santa) Aw! - (thuds) - (Willie) Fuck! - (Jolly Santa) Ooh! - Fucking asshole! - Fucking shit. - (grunts) Fucking asshole. This guy's a pedophiliac, here, and he's after all your kids. - You better get out of here. - (siren wailing) - You fucking perverted fucking asshole! - (gasping) (Willie) What the fuck? Hang on a second. He's the fucking kid diddler, not me. I'm a hero! (grunts) - Sure you won't die up there? - I've done smaller spaces, trust me. Well, if you don't make it, son, I got a cigar box, make a nice casket. Who you calling "son"? Well, I'm proud to say that my pussy is color-blind, so you never know. - (bangs) - Oh! Whoa! You go, little sperm. Get up in there. Well, you don't see something like that every day. (pants) - (exhales) - (bottles clinking) Ow! Bottles! Recycle that shit! Oh! What the fuck is tha... Oh, shit! No! Hey. I always wanted to fuck me a Santa. Well, I always wanted to shit on a tattooed dick so we're perfect for each other. - Cook, let's go. - See you in my dreams, chief. (Diane) Thank you. (sighs) You're not the first volunteer to go off the rails. Lucky for you, Giving City has a high standing in the community, so you won't get charged. You can turn in your suit when you clean yourself up. Now, hang on a second. You're firing me? I rooted out a pervert. You should be throwing me a fucking parade. And we're very grateful. But you reek of whiskey. You know the rules and you're flouting them. Flouting? I never sucked jizz out of nobody's ass. I mean, with a straw. I believe that's felching. (Diane) Not that I would know. Uh, happy holidays, Mr. Cook. Consider your freedom a gift from me. Well, hang on a second. Hang on! I only had one drink. And that was just to keep warm out there. I'm freezing my nuts off. And if we're being honest here, you, you guys should be supplying us with some kind of electric underwear or some shit. Oh, well, if we're being honest, I don't like being lied to. - Please. I need this. - Why do you care so much? (scoffs) Why do I care? Why do I care. (softly) I'll tell you why I care. Because the world's a fucking shit hole. But when I put this suit on, I feel like... Well, I feel like General MacArthur must have felt when he put his uniform on and went and killed all them Filipinos. Look, I, I put up with a lot of shit from kids... (stammers) For the kids. I won't piss on the suit. I really won't. I mean, give a broke-dick motherfucker a chance, will you? Fine. I'll give you a second chance. If you give me a chance to help you. All right. (clattering) How we looking, Alice? Well, according to this report, Giving City's gonna lose a record amount of money this year. Ugh, every time you say that, my dick gets so hard. - Okay. - Hey, why don't we just do it right now. - Come on. - No. (Regent) I'll up your commission to five percent. (Alice) Make it ten, and I'll let you do that thing with my shoe. Both shoes. And you have to watch. Deal. (sighs) - (man) You can't smoke here, sir. - (Willie) So call the fucking law. And while they're rolling their fat asses down here, I'll be smoking like an old Buick, all right? Arrested? Christ! William. - Not arrested. I was detained. - Yeah. Shot of gin. What were you thinking? You could have fucked this whole thing up. - I handled it. - Mmm. Told her I'd go to an AA meeting with her. (scoffs) Don't buy their shit, William. No such thing as an alcoholic. Just a sign of a weak liver. (sighs) I said I fucking handled it. What are you, deaf? Well, you talk like you have a cock in your mouth, shitstick. (Sunny laughs) Hey, you know why we call him "shitstick"? Because even when he was a baby, he tried to butt-fuck everything. - Goddamn it. - Stuffed monkey, neighbor's dog. I'm telling you, if it had a butt, he'd try to fuck it. He's with his little nub, going. (Sunny laughs) Anyway, I think you ought to be working the sexual angle with her, because I know for a fact that that husband isn't getting it done. That guy never rocked a clit in his life. And that is one piece of motherly advice I hope you took to heart. You motorboat that O-button till she's speaking in tongues. - You know what "son" means, right? - When did you turn into such a pussy? - Don't worry, I'm fine. - I'm not worried. I just don't want you hacking up your lung in my drink, okay? Not a chance. Nah, this chassis' built to last. You know, I smoked two packs of menthols a day, washed it down with a liter of this gin... And I could still fill that shot glass with this man's jizz. - I said I don't give a shit, okay? - Fine. I get it. You're mad at me. You think I was really ready to be a mom at 13? (Sunny) Huh? We were gonna wait at least another year. I mean, the one time your son of a bitch father didn't put it in my ass, I had to go and get pregnant. - Shit happens. - That's fucking beautiful. Look, I'm not gonna pretend I was a perfect mother. Yeah, no shit. You made me take the fall for you when I was 11. Well, there's no sense in us both going down. Besides, it made a man of you. You are who you are because of me. No, I'm not anything like you. Yeah? Well, you keep telling yourself that. Now where's your fucking midget? It's getting late. (moaning) (cell phone ringtone rings) ♪ Pop that pussy Hey, pop that pussy, baby ♪ - (Alice) What... What is that? - (ringing stops) Shit! (Alice)What, do you have a speaker up there? (Regent) Dorfman, get up here. You sure it was a phone ring? Might have just been the fan turning over. Well, Dorfman, last time I checked, fans don't "Pop That Pussy." No, I suppose they don't. No, I think Diane hired someone to spy on me. - Diane? That doesn't sound like her. - I want you to watch her. Anything unusual, I wanna know about it. And cover the whole building. I'm talking microphones, cameras, everything. Copy. Ladies' room is already taken care of. (Sunny chuckles) He's fucking Alice. - (scoffs) Go figure. - Why the fuck would you call me? Well, you're the genius who left your ringer on. Because you the only two people I know. Why would you call? What's she doing with that shoe? Oh, God! He heard a noise in the fucking vent. What's the big deal? He heard "Pop That Pussy" in the vent, and that is a big fucking deal. Think she knows? - (Sunny) Who? - You know, the redheaded gal, Diane. That her husband's fooling around with the help? I'm saying, do you think she knows that her fucking husband is ripping off the goddamn charity? Who gives a shit? As long as she doesn't get in the way. - Can you crack the safe? - Of course I can crack the fucking safe. Probably take me about three minutes. Three and a half tops. Well, you shave a minute off that, you may be good for something. - What about the alarm system? - It's a Centaur 2100. We power it down, we have ten minutes before it reboots. But I'm gonna need a key to the electrical room to access it. - It's the only way in. - Ah, shit, how are we gonna get that? (keys jangle) (Marcus) Don't even think about it, Willie. That big bitch is mine. He should show you some respect. - You're the talent, not him. - (Diane) Hey, Randall! Mind giving me a hand over here? I've gotta get this stuff to the auditorium. He'd love to, darling. Strong, strapping man like him. Clitoris, son. Do it for Mama. Thanks, Sunny. She's so sweet. I wish I had a hundred volunteers like her. Oh, yeah, she's something. I'm sure they only made one of her. (coffee pours) How you doing, beautiful? - (Marcus) Gina, was it? - That's right. - Ronald. We haven't officially met. - Well, hello, Ronald. Officially. I bet you got no idea how beautiful you really are. I don't know. I think I've got some idea. - Oh, you do, do you? - Maybe a little. I don't mean to be indiscreet, but I do pretty well. So if you can't bring your A game, don't even try. Sweetheart, I'm not sure you could handle my A game. You get one hit of me and you'll be addicted. - (chuckles) I like your confidence. - I'd light you up like the Fourth of July. Look, Ronald, I'm just gonna cut to the chase here. I am strictly first-class. I'm talking Chrysler 300, factory-direct, fully loaded. And after that... lobster. Now if you think you can handle that, then maybe, just maybe, I'll pencil you in. Bye. - ♪ Joy to the world, the Lord is come ♪ - (Diane giggles) Aren't they great? Regent likes to focus on the business, but I'm like you. I am all about those kids and the Christmas concert. (Diane) We all participate. Volunteers, staff. If you're interested, you could join us. You outta your goddamn mind? I ain't dancing around with a bunch of candy canes and shit. Because I'm all about the birth of Christmas. You know, the wise guys kicked him out of the hotel and the ejaculate conception and the drummer that didn't have shit to give him but some perfume... And the King Midas or one of them threatened to cut the kid in half, turn him into gold and but, see, I... It's a heavy deal for me. Pretty damn heavy. Are you talking about the true meaning of Christmas? - Exactly. - Right. Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow night at 7:30. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, it's only scary the first time. (camera clicking) - Does this bus go to Chicago? - (bus driver) No. Son, this bus goes to the Arrowhead Premium Outlets. - Is that close to Chicago? - (bus driver) No. (sighs) Okay. How do I look? You look like one of those trolls that gang-fucked Willy Wonka. (Sunny laughs) Good one, shitstick. Hey, Shaft, you ready to stick it to this chick tonight? Bitch, let me tell you something. When I was at the pen, everyone called me tripod. (laughs) Well, if your legs are six inches long, that's not that big of a fucking deal, see. Now, if you're six foot five and they called you tripod, - then you're talking about something. - (laughs) - Miserable fucks, both of you. - Mm. (burps) - Goddamn, did you eat your own shit? - No, I've been eating caramels. (Sunny) You know how caramels make Mama belch. Remember? No. No, I don't. (Sunny) No, come on. You remember. Look, when you were a baby, I used to chew and feed you caramels, just like a mama bird does. I'd chew and chew and chew till they were all milky. Goddamn. And then I'd... (spits) spit them right in your little mouth. And you'd just, you'd just squint your little... Can't you see I'm trying to eat a fucking pizza here? I swear to God, a fucking electric oven. (Leo Delibes' "The Flower Duet" playing) (keyboard clicking) Anyway, it took this new set of teeth to finally see the light. - Jesus, I already need a fucking drink. - (shushes) (man) People ask me if I miss my old teeth. But sometimes, you have to lose something to gain something. Now, I'm dating again, and I'm ready to find The One. - (applause) - (group leader) Thank you for that, Jason. - With no teeth, he ought to try dudes. - (softly) Terrible. Would anyone else care to share? Anyone? (group leader) The stage is yours. - Hi, I'm Diane and I'm an alcoholic. - (AA group) Hi, Diane. Maybe next time, you'll feel comfortable speaking. I don't know about that. - (sighs) - (Diane) Okay. Fine. Maybe you can just talk to me if that's easier. Do you ever feel like you hit rock bottom? You gotta be shitting me. I sure did. In my late 20's. You know, some people can have one drink and they're fine. I am not that kind of person. I get wild. - I'm all ears. How wild? - What? You mean like sex stuff? That kind of thing? Yes. Alcohol led me to make some not-so-good choices. But I've cleaned up my life. - I met Regent... - Wait a minute, hang on. (chuckles) You picked that douche bag up when you were sober? He was different when he was in the Peace Corps. He helped me find focus. You don't understand, it was bad. Three-ways, five-ways... Five-ways? How many holes do you have? - Anyway, the drinking had to stop. - Yeah, I guess so. It was probably making you forget all the fun you had. I'm talking about addiction, Mr. Cook. Like sex? Or booze? Listen, I'll tell you what, I'd like to get you in that back seat there. And tear your little panties off and get that ass in my face and just fuck that pussy like you can't imagine. Excuse me? You filthy, dirty... Well, I thought that's what we were talking about here. Get out of my car! - Damn, no sweat. - (Diane) Unbelievable. - (Willie) Goddamn. - (camera clicking) - (Diane) I'm trying to help you. - (Willie) Look, I'm sorry. - I fucking read you wrong. I was just... - (tires screech) (Gina) Well, thank you, Ronald. - That was some fine crustacean. - Yeah. Maybe we should take this upstairs. - Hmm. - (Marcus) What? When it's right, it's right. I feel it, you feel it? - You're really fun, but just... - I'm not tall enough for you? - What? - Go on and say it. No! Your height has nothing to do with it. I don't even see height. What's the trouble, then, baby? You're just not my type. I'm into older guys. You know, like, older Jewish guys, older Irish guys, dads. Not my dad, other people's dads. They're the best. You know, they're usually into anal. But their wives won't give it up. But I don't mind. I'm just into, you know, more mature, experienced guys. Guys who are well-traveled, cultured and into butt stuff. Bad boys, you know. Guys who don't give a fuck and treat me like shit. A guy who if I asked him to choke me, would enjoy it just a little too much. Damn, girl, I wouldn't pick you out for that kind of shit. Christmas in general gets me so drenched. I mean, a guy breaks into your house, eats your food and then punishes you because you were naughty. I think I'm gonna go upstairs and watch It's a Wonderful Life and rub one out right now. But thanks for the lobster. Ain't that but a bitch! Done ate ten pounds of lobster and I didn't even get a chance to smell that pussy. Damn. Shit. (Diane) Fine, get in. Regent and I haven't had sex in over a decade. We stay together for the charity. I'm a good girl, Mr. Cook, but sometimes I need to be bad. Now get your filthy ass in the car. (chuckles) See, that's what I thought. (Diane moans) Oh, yeah! Fuck me like the dirty little slut that I am. - (moans) - Call me Santa. - What? - Call me Santa. Don't be weird. Tell me how dirty this is. - Call me Santa. - Shut up. And spit on me. (moans) (Diane) Fuck! - Tell me how dirty it is. (moans) - Okay. U h, it's a dumpster in an alley. It's pretty, pretty fucking dirty, I guess. - Tell me it's fucking dirty! - Okay, it's fucking dirty. - It's dirty. - (moans) Yes, it's dirty. (chuckles) - (Diane) Oh, oh, fuck me.

Fuck me, Santa! - (groans) - Oh. - (gasps) - Merry fucking Christmas. - (Willie) All right, then. - (Diane) That also... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know! Uh, it never happened. I get it. U m, I ain't exactly what you call the romantic type, you know. I don't go in for all the sappy shit. But, um, I gotta tell you, you got gigantic titties. - And that's no shit. - Um... thanks? - No sweat. - (cell phone rings) - See you. - (car door closes) - (cell phone rings) - Fuck. - This better be an emergency. - Willie, where are you? I'm in Chicago, but I can't find you anywhere. Wait, hang on a second. What are you doing in fucking Chicago? I wanted to surprise you for Christmas. The best Christmas gifts are always a surprise. Are you off of your goddamn nut? Is that what you do? (Willie over phone) You follow people all the way across the fucking country? Not everyone. Just you. - (Thurman over phone) Are you surprised? - No, this shit happens every day. - (Thurman) It does? - No. On what fucking planet...? (Willie) Never mind. What the fuck are you doing? Uh, Willie, it's really cold here. I didn't bring a coat. Only my gloves. (Willie) Goddamn it. You gotta be shitting me. Do you got a pencil or some shit to write on? (knocking on door) - (knocking continues) - Who is it? - Who the fuck are you? - Grandma Willie! (man talking on TV) (Thurman) And Willie was in such a hurry to get me my elephant that I guess he forgot to pay for it. And that made the policemen really mad. So they followed him back to the house. And Willie ran really fast and he almost got to the door, but then they shot him like eight times in the back. In the cowboy movies, they say that's not even fair. And this is the first present Willie ever got me for Christmas. With his blood. - Willie, you're home! - Goddamn, kid. Watch the spine bone. I was just telling your mom how you're a hero. Yeah, yeah. Hang on a second. You didn't bring a fucking coat, but you brought that elephant? - You didn't tell me to bring a coat. - I didn't tell you to come. - Is this your spawn? - Do I look like I made him? Well, if this ain't fetal alcohol syndrome, then what the fuck is it? - He keeps trying to make me a sandwich. - That's what he does. Elf! Hey! You get that key? You got smaller. - (sighs) - What the... Am I tripping? You might be, because, you know, certain pussy has hallucinogenic aftereffects if you eat too much of it. I found out the hard way once when I messed with my own kind. One time, I ate too much turkey bacon, I didn't poop for two weeks. For four weeks. - The key, shorty. - Okay, first of all, fuck you! See that? I told you. I knew he didn't have it in him. And second of all, what in the fuck is he doing here? - That is not how you serve a sandwich. - Willie. I'm working on it, okay? (clears throat) Hey, kid, listen. This is really not the right place for you to be, okay? Because there's not enough beds? I only counted one, plus a couch. - Exactly. - You should get bunk beds, Willie. (Willie) Yeah, maybe we'll do that. But, uh, in the meantime, let's you and me head out, all right? Bye, Elf. Bye, Willie's mom. My mom's in Jesus' house with Mary and Joseph and the talking walnut. - You 100 percent sure he's not yours? - Yeah. Well, then, cut him loose. Set some boundaries, for chrissake. You can't have every stray following you around like a lost puppy. - (Sunny) Jesus! - I said I'm going, okay? Can we get a Chicago pizza? It's like pizza, but in Chicago. Yeah, we'll get a pizza. No sweat. This is really fun, Willie. I didn't even know you had a mom. - What'd you think? I was just hatched? - Well, where were you born? I was born in the Pulaski County Juvenile Detention Center in Little Rock, Arkansas. - Oh, that sounds really nice. - Well, it wasn't nice. And she's a mean fucking bitch, so don't go getting any ideas, all right? Well, sometimes you're not nice. But you're still Santa. Listen kid, seriously. You're all grown-up and shit now, okay? - You gotta stop that. - Well, I know you're not the Santa. But you're still my Santa. Come on. Let's go. (cell phone vibrates) (cell phone vibrates) (softly) Fuck. (Willie) Fuck! Fucking pussy! (indistinct chatter) Look at all the Santas! I really get to stay here? Goddamn right. So how long is the kid staying here? Hell if I know, I ain't his fucking secretary. - You run the joint. - (chuckles) Cook, you crack me up. I what? Boarding room's downstairs on the left. Any bed that's not taken. Alrighty, here we go. Now listen, don't be sitting on any toilet seats. If you gotta take a shit just stand over it, couple of feet away, take aim and blow it in there. 'Cause I'm pretty sure crabs can jump. All right? Don't let anybody muscle up on you in the showers either, because they'll try. And if a fight breaks out, go straight for the nuts or gouge an eye out. (vomits) I don't think I like it here, Willie. Then you should go home, like I told you to start with. But it's not home if there's nobody there. What about Granny? I'm sure she misses you. - (Thurman) She died. - When? (Thurman) Two years ago. Same day as the President's Day sale at Blue Mesa Toyota and Scion where they put the "whee" in wheels. Well, Granny had a good run. She was about 150 fucking years old, anyway. Look at this, this is not so bad. Look, you got bunk beds. (Willie) Look at that. Ow! Goddamn, kid! Fuck! - Will we have Christmas together? - Fuck, I don't know. - But, Willie... - No "but, Willie." Goddamn it! I've been chasing your ass off ever since I fucking met you. Do you not take a hint? I fucking told you that I ain't that guy. Life sucks a big, giant dick, kid. But you're a fucking man now and you gotta face up to it. Welcome to the shit show. - But you're my family. - No, I'm not your family. (sighs) - Okay. I'll try to be a man. For you. - No, not for me. For you. - Even though I'm all alone. - (Willie) You're not all alone. (chuckles) Are you shitting me? I mean, look around here. (Willie) You got all these great guys. Except that one jerking off over there. And that one watching him jerk off. You know what, just kind of stay in this section right here, okay? - (breathes nervously) - You'll be fine. (man coughs) (door closes) Hey. - Where the hell have you been? - What are you, my fucking mother? I've been dealing with the kid, all right? Oh, well, don't lose your focus. We still need that key. I tried seducing the girl myself but she's strictly dickly. Concert's tomorrow night. So you better step up, buddy boy. I thought the midget was doing it. Marcus couldn't fuck his way out of a wet paper bag. I'll make sure she knows you got the hots for her. - Really? - That's what he told me. Oh, here he comes. Of course you may have to make the first move, - because he seems like the shy type. - Okay. Hey. We still good for tomorrow? The plan. - Cutting her out after the grab. Right? - Yeah, yeah.

And it's actually better because then you get to pick the people who are in your family. And you're the family I picked. And that's why I followed you to Chicago. Because I didn't want you to spend Christmas alone. So can you come? And then maybe after we can go to SantaCon or... I, I can't. I can't come. - Look, I'll try to make it. Okay? - Okay. I'll look for you, Willie. I'll look for you and I'll wave like this. Okay? Yeah. Okay, All right. Good deal. - All right. I'll see you. - Bye, Willie. (door closes) What are you, the fucking FBI? That place is gonna be crowded. He won't even know I'm not there. - Good. - (Thurman) Good night, Elf! For a minute there, I thought you were going soft. (muttering) I hate your guts, motherfucker. But business is business. Let's do this. (indistinct chattering) - Hi, thank you so much for coming. - Okay? - You look gorgeous. - Amazing. H I, good to see you. (engine revving) - Time? - Concert starts in five. (applause) As you know, Christmas is a time for giving. And we want to thank you all for being here tonight. All right, let's sync them up, boys. At 7:45, the power goes down. That's on me. You got ten minutes to get to Regent's office, crack that safe, grab the money, throw it down the garbage chute and then get the hell out of there before anybody knows what's hit them. Now please join me in welcoming the Giving City Children's Choir. (applause) And without further ado, I would like to introduce our choirmaster, Renee. (applause) You got a match? Well, send it over!

Call the police! - Let's go, come on! - I'm on it. Well, that can't be more than half a million, 600 tops. Well, fuck, that's all we got. - (gun clicks) - Perfect amount for my cut.

I'm gonna live like a king this time. - A fucking sultan! - Not in this lifetime, Sparky. - The bag goes with me. - You mean with us. - No, I mean me. - What the fuck did you just say? When I said this was my last job, I meant it was my last job with you. I knew I should've left, second I saw your miserable fucking face. Why did I forget? N ice job on the safe, though. Yeah, I'm real proud of you. Well, you know something, Mama? Maybe you're not as smart as you think you are. - Did you forget about this? - (police car sirens wailing) Oh, how could I have forgotten? Go ahead. Shoot me, shitstick. They're blanks, Willie. You really think I'd be dumb enough to put real bullets in that gun? Well, I ain't afraid of you, bitch! I'll blow a hole through your ass so...

(pants) - Hey! - (groans) - Found this on the coffee table. - Well, hoo-fucking-rah, William. Well, give me the fucking bag. I'm taking this back to the kids. I'd rather them have it than your sorry ass. - Don't test me, boy. - You're gonna shoot me too? - (fireworks exploding) - (grunts) (crowd cheering) - (groans) You fucking shot me! - I told you I would.

(Thurman) Willie! (police) Drop the weapon! Get down! The fuck is going on? Hey, goddamn it! (Willie) I caught a fucking midget-murdering fucking armed robber. I'm a goddamn hero. Don't worry, Willie. I'm okay. It's just in my butt. Willie? - (heart rate monitor flat lines) - No! (Willie) Oh, f... - (Willie groans) - (woman) Stand clear. (grunts) Oh! Fuck me! - (exhales) - (sighs) - Merry Christmas. - Yeah. (Willie) Well, I guess this is what they call a happy ending. But as far as Christmas miracles go, shit, I don't know. That asshole Regent ended up getting busted while I got off clean by ratting out my steaming pile of shit mother. Guess I did learn one thing about family from that crazy bitch.
