Where are you going, gents? And what do you have in the bag? It's just some luggage. Young man, the state charges you with two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, engaging in public violence and violence against property. It was the 6th of April, ma'am... 1652. Dube, are you still taking a dump? Fuck, Mahlangu, get out of here! Fucking shit! Ace of spades. Ace of spades. Ace of spades! Old man, 2 rand a bet. Ace of spades. -Mondy. -Come on, sweetie. You, over there. If you get this one, I'll buy you a hair relaxer for your hair push-back. -Mondy. -What? -Why didn't you come to school? -Leave me alone, I'm hustling. Come on, man. Cops! Let's get out of here! Stop! You guys are late. Brenda, sorry. Brenda. Brenda. Yo, what's the problem with your girl? You know what? How are you guys going to study when you're in jail? Hey, Brenda, Mandela is in jail, right? But he is studying. All the people that are leading us are educated. And look at you. You don't want to go study. And you're wearing a school uniform. What nonsense is that? We've got a history exam and you didn't study. Don't tell me about his-story. Let me tell you about our-story. Stop for a second. Do you know what happened in 1652, when Jan van Riebeeck landed? He flooded the entire place with Coloureds! Then Vasco da Gama came here with his big ship and dumped all his spices on us. Now everything we eat is too hot. Do you know Shaka Zulu, huh? I didn't think so. Do you know Queen Modjadji? The Rain Queen. You didn't know her. Do you even know Hlatshwayo? It's "Cetshwayo." Yes, that one. Do you know who killed King Hintsa? Harry Smith. Don't tell me I'm making a noise. Here's what I say, fuck these Boers! Fuck Bantu Education! Let them go shit-- Don't you see that there are people around? Do you want us all to die because of your noise? Get hold of yourself, there are snitches around. -Brenda. How are you? -I'm fine. Does your dad know you're here? Solly Mahlangu. What have you got there? Miles Davis. Jesus. Do you know what this is, my boy? This is hip. For sure, Bra-T. I'm gonna be there. -I'm also coming. -We're not going. -I said I'm going. -I said we're not going. Solly, Bantu Education is a joke. Don't you see they're messing with your brain? They're making sure that you understand all of their commands. "Yes, boss. No, boss. I'm sorry, boss." Hold on a second, I've got something for you. Hey, kid... beat it. Uncle London, I want to play. Come, now. The grown-ups have business to do. Hurry out. I'll buy you a sweet, okay? So, I'll see you guys at the bus stop. Behind the station. -June 16th. -Okay, Bra-T. Can I have my LP please? You'll get your album on June 16th. In Soweto. -Let's go. -Don't stress. Let's go. Let's go. -Cool, Miles Davis. -Cheers, Tommy. All right, kid. You can play now. Make sure you look after my car. Brother Lucas. How are you? Good. Are you cool? Yeah. I'm fine. Happy birthday. You didn't forget. How could I forget? Eh? Heavyweight. And the record? You can go play it. Cool. -Hello, Ma. -Hello, my child. You've grown into a man. You look just like your father. Really, Ma? How was your day? It went well, but the Boers are slave drivers. Brother, how's work? A job is a job, Solly. I do my work, I get paid. What can I say? And you? -It's okay, but the police... -Solly, they're doing their job. How does it feel to be a man now? The sack must be getting heavy now. Bra-Lucas, I don't know... -Are you a faggot? -Lucas... Work is waiting for me. I have to go. Girls will be flocking. You must go get them. Brother Lucas... Watch out world, here comes my handsome son. Oh, Ma. -Where are you off to? -I'm going to Marabastad. Okay, buy me snuff. This one is almost finished. -Okay, Ma. Yeah. -You'll buy it for me? Thank you, my boy. Don't forget your pass. Ma. -Go well. -Okay, Ma. Sol, man. How are you? Hi, Mondy. -Who are you with? -Sure, Miles Davis. So, the march on the 16th, are you in? -Mondy, I can't. -You can. -I'm working. -You're a hawker... I'm supporting my mother and brother. Your brother. He earns enough working for the enemy. Hey. Don't come with your shit. Shit? Shit is being a hawker, you sellout. Yeah? What did you say, boy? Solly-- Shit. Looks like you forgot who took care of you at initiation. And you, Bra-T... Where is my LP? Which people? Nah, Bra-T. A coward is a person that kills his own black brother. Spider was a worthless traitor. If Spider were to walk through here now, I'd kill him again. So you can get killed by just being labelled a traitor? Then kill me, Mondy just called me a snitch. -Now you're talking shit, my boy. -Am I? That's right. Be careful. -Mondy, let's go. -Fuck off. Why are you so quiet? Say something. What else did they teach you at initiation? Hey, Brenda, what happens at initiation stays there. -But why? Tell me. -It's men's talk. But who am I going to tell? -Like I said, it's men's talk. -But who am I going to tell? Like I said, it's men talk. Come here. If you won't open your mouth and tell me, I won't give it up either. -Baby, no. -I won't. Okay, you think you're better than the guys they catch every day? Brenda... Look, I lost my father to the Boers. They are cold-hearted. I've experienced it myself. I don't want to talk about this, okay? I thought you were not afraid. Brenda, I'm not afraid of anything. I'm going to the march. With or without you. Got you, little devil! Nah, man. Piss off! Soweto was a bloodbath, boy. Jesus. Are you with us? Lucky is coming with us. Yes. Solly, please don't go with them. Let's go. Solly, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you. Please forgive me for not listening to you. No, Brenda, I'm the coward. Don't say that. I let you go to the march alone, and I stayed behind. What kind of man does that? I'm sorry. They killed innocent children. There were dogs... tear gas. And stones flying... everywhere. There was so much noise. Then gunshots. Then it's quiet. Quiet. It was horrific. It was as if I could hear the skin being separated from their bodies. You could hear their breath being sucked out of their bodies. Then you'd hear gunshot after gunshot. Even now... I can hear the gunshots. Gunshots. Children falling to the ground. Gunshots. Children falling to the ground. Gunshots. I've never seen so much blood in my life. Why do those Boers hate us so much? What have we done to them? Why can't they have mercy on us? What have we done? I got tired. Angry. My family was forcefully removed from our ancestral land. It killed my father. I had to help my mother. And my manhood had been violated. I couldn't take it anymore. What would you do? Why aren't you eating your food? I'm not hungry, Ma. Solomon... This is not life. This can't be how God wants us to live. Kalushi, you don't question God. God has a way of doing things. What way is that, Ma? Look at my face. What God allows children to be beaten up and shot dead? Our land... and our father to be taken? Don't bring your father into this. Look, I know for certain that if my dad was still alive, we wouldn't be living like this. Solomon... don't talk to Ma like that. Lucas, Solomon, Jesus is alive. Have faith. Now, eat, my child. Ma... are you still waiting for Jesus? Waiting for Jesus to come back and fix our problems? Jesus is never coming back. He's dead. They told us at initiation... when you're dead, you don't come back. Lucas! You'll kill my son! What's got into your head? One of these days you're going to regret saying these things. Let him go, Ma. Let him go... Where's Solly? Hurry up. Get inside. What's with the big suitcase? What did you pack? Why are you so slow? -Ma. Ma. -Yes? -Solomon has gone. -Gone? Where to? He wrote this note... "Brother Lucas, Brother Lucas. I have left. Please don't bother looking for me." He's gone, Ma. Since when has he started writing us letters when he goes to work on the train? Today is a big church day, and I'm already late. Ma, Solomon has gone! Listen, find him. When I come back from church, I want to see both of you here. These kids will drive me mad. You're killing us. What's going on here? Tommy, this car is stuck. Maybe it's the water? No, man. I don't have time for nonsense. Hurry up, man. Let's go. Tommy, maybe if we try to fix it... We don't have time to fix it. You fucked up big time. We're marching up and down, the Boers shoot at us. Up and down, up and down. Were you with another girl? Because we were with Brenda. Let it go, okay? -We just want to know. -Hey, man. Hey, Solly, Solly... Let him go. That bag is probably full of fruit. Bra-T, we've been walking for a long time. Where is this place? Jesus! This shirt cost me 50 rand! Ah. I thought something serious was going on, man. Bra-T, this is a designer shirt. Designer shirt, my ass, mfana. You'll replace that in Mozambique. Mozambique? This is limited edition. Are you sure there are no crocodiles here? No. Just move on. Be careful of these stones. Hurry up! -Are there snakes in this water? -No, let's go. Vorster, you motherfucker! We'll be back. Hey, you! Hands up! -Get down! -Don't shoot! -Don't shoot. Don't shoot. -This is Mozambique. We know. We are ANC, comrades. Why are they taking our bags? -What? -We are ANC. We are ANC, comrades. Get down! Get down! -Shut up! How many? -Four. Shut up! Oh, hello. Hello. Mondy... Mondy... Mondy, wake up. Drink this. There you go. Like that. Where are we? We're in Mozambique. London and Lucky boy are over there. We made it. Yes, we have. Mondy. You'll get better. -Davis. -Hello, Lucky. These Shangaans will kill you. We're not in Pretoria. Whatever. Thank you. Thank you, Ma. What's the name of your tail? Don't know. I don't have a name. No, Bra-T. I think he's serious. This is simple. Let's give him a name. No, man. No. No, no. You're kidding. Yeah, man. Add some color to the poor kid. You see how dark this boy is? He's a foreigner. Like, "Black like me. Black like me." Yo. King size. -See? -So you like the name? Okay, come here. Yeah, man. Jesus. -One. -"One." -Two. -"Two." -Three. -"Three." -Four. -"Four." Five. "Bread"? But you heard him, right? I am with you, Bra-T. The food here is shit, the toilets stink... Look at this bread, you could use it as a soccer ball. And I can't take jerking off anymore. Mondy, be serious, please. I am serious. A little English and you think you got balls? Here, Cola. Go. Go. Go. Okay. Now, look here... You're naughty. Bra-T, we've been in this shithole of a country for six fucking months. It's Portuguese, FRELIMOs, kids named Coca-Cola, mosquitoes biting us, kids constantly crying, the rain doesn't want to stop... Bra-T... Do something. What are you looking at? This looks like my shirt. Answer me! Mondy, what's wrong with you? He's a kid! Have you lost your mind? Fuck off, shithead. Go cool off. Hey, Cola. Don't mind him. Okay? I have to find Mondy. This is a river when we have floods. My mom used to wash me here. It reminds me of her. That was before the war. You must miss her a lot. Yes. -How many? -Four. -Take me there. -Yes, Captain. Are you from South Africa? -I'm talking to you! -Yes. -What? -She said, "Pack your things." Let's go, let's go! -Let's go, let's go. -See you later, with your funky food. And this tail? -He can stay. He's an orphan. -No, I'm not. No, no. He's with me. If you want to survive, you better listen to me. Sorry, sister, you're making a mistake. -He stays. -He's with me. He's with me. -He's with me! -No! Solomon! -Solomon! Solomon! -Hey! He's with me! Don't leave me! Solomon! Solomon! Solomon! Don't leave me! UNITA traitors. It's between the MPLA and UNITA. Gents, you can see how it is. Let's be vigilant. -Power! -Is ours! -Is ours! -Power! I've just received word. Comrades, our commander-in-chief, O.R. Tambo, the general, has got a very important message for us. Please come closer, comrades. In the middle, it's a machine gun. -The power! -It belongs to us! -It belongs to us! -The power! -Are you scared of them? -No, we are not! We want them! Oliver Tambo! -Power! -Is ours! -Is ours! -Power! -The power! -It belongs to us! -It belongs to us! -The power! ...comrades. The mieliepap is fucking cold. Hey. That's the language of the oppressor. You know, comrades, Bantu Education is an instrument used by Verwoerd, and now by Vorster, to ensure they have an endless supply of uneducated laborers. It is there to protect the stronghold of the Boers. Finished! I agree. Are we not all free-born men? Hey, man. There you go again with your Afrikaans. Ah, piss off! Comrades. What's happening, fucker? What is your problem? Do you understand? You faggot. This is the path you need to follow. Go well. Cool, cool. Come, come. Fuck! Take cover! Bra-T. Are you okay? Yeah, Bra-T, Mondy is right. Yes, I have a problem. What makes you so special? -I have family there. -So what? What makes you so special? Hey. That's final. Are we clear? The struggle continues, comrade. Sir, what do you think? He looks like a terrorist to me. Solly, we've got a plan. We have to go to Soweto. Who is in Tembisa? Did you hear the radio? We are needed in Soweto. Man, fuck the commanders. Phineus. It's me, Mahlangu. Open. Who's that, knocking like a policeman? What do you want? Cousin, it's been a while. How are you? Cool, Phineus. Cool. Mondy. Last I saw you was at initiation. You didn't finish, you dog! Don't start with your shit. Yeah... Why are you all so serious? -Who's this? -Lucky, Phineus. Phineus, Lucky. Cool. Come in, we're drinking. Why are you so angry? It's cold outside. You're sitting around drinking. Phineus, is that manhood? We're just chilling. It's time we fight them. It's time we killed these dogs. Whoa, guys... are you guys serious? -Huh. -What the hell is this? You can see for yourself. There is nothing happening in Tembisa. Hey. Relax. We're almost there. One more person. -Where are you going, gents? -Orlando. And what do you have in the bag? It's just some luggage. Solly! Solly! See you at the meeting point. Okay, cool. Mondy! -Hurry up! Hurry up, man! -Fuck! Hurry up! Hurry up, man. -Hey! -Let go of me! -I swear I'll kill him. -Stay where you are. You'll shit yourself, asshole! Solly, get up! Run, Solly! Mondy! Run, Solly! Hey, piss off, man-- This is a terrorist attack. Who do we appoint to work on this? The prime minister asked me personally to come here all the way from Pretoria, to make sure that we... Come, men. Come, come, come! -...you, do things right. -Shut up! Come on! You're wasting my fucking time! Pick this thing up! We need someone smart. Someone with a cool head. Minister, may I introduce to you... Head Inspector Eric van Heerden. -Come, come, come! -Close, man. Close. Shut your fucking mouth! He will handle the case. Van Heerden, we don't want any problems here. You will handle this case with purpose and efficiency. -Do we understand each other? -Yes, Minister, perfectly. Good day, gentlemen. You going to talk now? You think you're clever? Who is Solomon? Are you enjoying this, Jabulani? Do you want us to stop? Tell me, who is Solomon? Byron told me I should ask you. Don't want to talk, huh? I'm asking you one more time. Who... is... Solomon? -Hi. -Hi. What's happening here? -What do you mean? -I'm trying to put the case together. You're beating the shit out of them while I'm trying to question them. We're softening these kaffirs up for questioning. Ready to talk? Come. Walk. Gentlemen, I am due back in court. Keep it brief. You went too far with the Motloung interrogation. Yes. With all due respect, Minister, he was like that when you appointed me. Yes, but what are the implications? Can the other one stand trial? What's his name again? -Mahlangu. -Yes. Can Mahlangu stand trial? Yes, Minister. But most of our witnesses point to Motloung... Man, Motloung, Mahlangu... Fucking kaffir names... I don't give a damn about your witnesses. Will someone hang for this, or not? -Minister-- -What sort of message will we be sending? Two white people are dead. Murdered in cold blood. Two good reasons why this Mahlangu dog should hang. Minister, but what if we can't prove that Mahlangu... Fuck it, van Heerden. Was he one of the fucking kaffirs running around the streets of Johannesburg, firing machine guns and throwing hand grenades, or not? -Did two white people die, or not? -Yes, Minister. Don't underestimate the long arm of the law. Come. Mondy. What have you done? Mondy. Get them! Sorry... Take them away! -Hell, that oke is dof. -Yeah, he's really dof. Ah, dof or not, I'm still gonna watch it. Yeah, you can say that again. Hell, that oke is dof. Dof or not, I'll still watch it. -Young man, speak up. -I heard! They are done with you. You can step down. It's painful for him to have been sold out by Phineus. Our own blood. Didn't they say that Mondy is the one who fired? Yes, Ma. It's their law. How's Ma? She can't hold on anymore. All of us are struggling with this. That's why she didn't come to see you. Ma said I must give you this. Tell her I said thank you. It will keep me warm. So... I apologize for leaving you on that day. It's okay, don't worry. It's in the past. Is everyone doing okay at home? They are well. I love you, Brenda. I love you with all my heart. Always. I am scared. Don't be. When you think of me, look up at the heavens... and I'll be with the stars. We're going to get you out of here. I know the majority of the warders here. -What are you talking about? -I'm talking about an escape. When I get to Mamelodi, I'll talk to Bra Frank. The windows in these cells are big enough to climb through. Bra Frank will be waiting for you. -Brother. Brother. -Brenda. Brenda. Brother Lucas, I have caused enough trouble for our family. We can get you out. It ends here. I have accepted it. It's best you do the same. I love you all. It's time. I have to go. Power! -Power! -Is ours! The struggle continues.
