Without him, koruba would still be in ruins, my dear. Don't you understand? >> Times have changed. >> Oh, darling. >> We're at peace now. Does the man realize he's disrupting our nation by his little visit? It is cabot. He has returned, my darling. Cabot! Talena: Cabot. >> Xenos. >> I do not wish to be disturbed. >> You will like it less when you hear my news. Tarl cabot has returned to gor. >> I told you, you would not be pleased. >> That old fool, the elder.

It is truly a time of great celebration. >> I'm so glad to see marienus happy again. >> My father's in love. >> You don't seem very happy about it. >> Thank you, darling. >> There's something... Something about Lara I don't like. And xenos. >> Those priest kings are very dangerous. They have unknown powers. > Um, our honored guest has no drink. >> Your highness. > So, watney Smith. Does our world please you? >> Oh, extremely. Especially when I'm in the company of such a beautiful and charming queen. >> You and cabot. Are you very friendly? >> We teach at the same school. >> Hey. I came from far away for your smile, huh. My lord. >> I trust you've enjoyed yourself, son. Talena. [Claps] Tonight, we have a very special vintage. Bring on the wine. [Cheers] Hup. [Laughter] >> Well. There's wine in the other barrel. >> Serve the wine. >> Hey, hup, my friend. >> Miss me? >> Not enough. >> Listen. Don't think we can't live without you. >> To my daughter, talena. And cabot of the earth. A man who one day could be the new king of koruba. A toast. >> To the new king. Yeah! Yeah! >> Koruba. >> Master. >> We have to talk. And be unheard. >> We have no more enemies. >> Your enemies and mine are all around US. The priest xenos. >> How could he be dangerous if marienos is king? >> Lara is in xenos power. And she controls marienos. I needed you sooner. Guard: I have gate watch tonight. Guard two: And I have prison. >> I needed you sooner. But the planets were not in the proper position. Then I summoned you through the power of the home stone. You must help US. >> How can I help you? >> Protect the throne. And the freedom of the people of koruba. And the home stone. You will inherit my powers. >> And you will always guide me. You will guide me? Of course. [Romantic music plays] >> The queen. >> Your majesty. >> Tell me, watney. Would you like to share my power with me? >> Oh, uh. >> If I stay as wife to marienos, the kingdom will descend to talena. And from the way things look. She'll be joined by that fool, cabot. >> Well, you're right. He's, he's, he's, he's an absolute fool. >> True. True. But you, you can be a master. >> Are you, uh? Are you making me an offer? >> Tell me. How do they make love on your planet? Is it very different from ours? I'd be most curious to find out. >> So would I. [Town chatter] >> Okay. I've made up my mind. I'm gonna ask her tonight. To marry me. >> Tonight? Alone? Oh, my god. >> Do you think she will accept? >> Hell, cabot. I don't know. She's really something, isn't she? >> I mean. She's really, uh, a whoa. >> Yeah. Marriage. >> But I love her. I really do. >> Well, on the other hand. If you're sure. Hey, cabot. You can't just ask her to marry you. Can you? I mean, aren't there some kind of rituals? Hey, I mean, she's a Princess. >> Yeah, you're right. She's a Princess. But look... >> Why don't you ask the king? >> That's a good idea. >> A drink, my husband. >> Darling. To US. >> Peace. [Frantic music plays] >> Good luck. >> Marienos can be a stubborn man. Especially when it comes to his daughter. >> Thank you, my friend. Marienos? >> Go. Go on. >> Marienos? >> Go, go. >> Marienos is dead! Guards! >> Marienos! Marienos. No! >> Let's call the guards. >> Guards! >> What's happened? >> The king is dead. Marienos, the king, is dead. >> Marienos is dead. He killed marienos. Guards. What have you done? >> What happened? >> Dead. My husband, the king, is dead. You're a liar. >> You did this. You murdered my father. >> That's impossible. Lara was with me. The whole evening. [Dramatic music continues] >> It is written. The wife of the king shall rule in his place. Will you accept the title of queen? >> I can hardly. In my time of grief. >> Oh, but you must. For the people. >> For the people. >> You're not the queen. You're a killer. >> Take her away. >> Don't touch her! >> Guards! Put them in chains. >> Get them! >> There are too many. Come. Seize them! You know where you're going? >> Certainly. [Music builds] >> Get them. [Swords clang] Kill him. >> Lower your weapons. Put your weapons down. I have never disobeyed an order. But, now I must. This man saved our city. >> Justice must be done. Out of our way, old man. >> Go, cabot. >> I won't leave you. >> The guards will never harm me. >> You must be safe for talena and the people of koruba. >> Go get cabot. Now. Go get cabot. Remove the body. >> I'll get the hunter. Let me out of here! >> Lara. This is incredible. To rule after so many years studying waiting, teaching people about men with power. And now, ha, if those fools like Napoleon and Hitler could do it. Why not watney Smith? King watney. I love it. What's the matter? This is a great moment for me. I mean, for US. Hey. What is this? Get your hands off me. What is, what is this a joke? Lara! I'm the future king. Lara, you promised me power. Guys, can we talk? Am I your future king? Okay, don't believe me. Okay, that's it. You're gonna lose your heads. I'm warning you. I'm gonna count to three. One, two... Help! >> You know. I'm really concerned about talena. >> Don't worry. The elder will take care of her. >> Yeah. The elder. We can't let Lara and xenos get away with this. We have to find some, some help. Some friends. >> Sure. Like your friend watney? >> Watney. Where's the nearest town? >> That way. But it's too far. We'll never make it. >> Any alternatives? >> No way. It's too dangerous. I'm not walking in the dark. [Hissing] Hot, tired, thirsty. >> About how much further do you think we have to go? >> Couple of hours. More or less. As the tarn flies. >> Need some help? Careful. [Sweeping music plays] The hunter. >> We've all heard of you, ost. Said to be the finest man hunter on gor. What do you have to say for yourself? Ost: I'm not dead yet. >> There's a prisoner loose in the desert. And I want him back alive. Bring him to me. And you shall receive fifty thousand tarsks. Dead. Nothing. The hunter is hungry. Like an animal. That's good. Now, how shall we dispose of the pathetic talena? >> What about a contest? Between talena and, uh, another woman. If she dies. >> The gods, not I, will determine her fate. You are wise, xenos. >> Remember that. >> I'll remember. But I do not like to be given orders. [Party chatter] >> Am I to be freed? >> Put her in the center. You'll have a chance. To fight your way to freedom. If you survive. Bring in her challenger. >> The challenger. [Whip cracks] >> Silence. There will be no rules. Kill her. [Thud] [Music swells] You shall never be free. Take her to her cell. >> I need a paga. >> I would love an ice cold beer. >> Beer? Huh? The drink in the cans. >> Oh, the drink in the metal. The one I told you about. Look out. Get down. Do you think they saw US? >> Either that or they're psychic. >> Better'd get out of here. There are more or less ten. Are you okay? >> He-yaw. He-yaw. [Horses gallop] >> Your last opponent was far too easy. You are going to have to encounter another before you can attain your freedom. >> Why should I trust you this time? >> Do you have a choice? >> Why don't you fight me? And deprive myself the pleasure of watching you die. Enter the ladies. [Cheering] [Clapping] Take her away. That little fighting bird must die. >> Why not wait until you've caged her mate. >> Has cabot been captured? >> Do not be too eager to have your revenge. >> Why not? Am I not queen? Who dares challenge me? >> There are still those in koruba who would have another in your place on the throne. >> Let them dare try. >> Let's move. We won't last another day without water. This way. Look. Water. >> No, cabot, no! No, cabot, no! No, cabot! Stop. It's poison. >> How do you know? That's funny. That mountain over there. >> It's... I, I saw that mountain yesterday. We're walking a circle. >> Look. Slavers. [Screaming] >> Hold my arm. Hold my arm. >> Marienos' goal was to end slavery. Lara, obviously, has no such intention. >> Yeah. I see. Let's go. They have water. >> I'm not so sure I want to end up a slave. >> Listen. As long as I have some blood left in my veins, I will always fight slavery and oppression. Remember this. [Dramatic music builds] [People screaming] [Indistinct chatter] Hold on. You should go on a diet. >> All right. >> Okay? >> Let go. [Music continues] >> They left this one to die. He's dead. >> There's nothing we can do. [Yelling] [Whips cracking] >> Come on! Let's go! Move it! >> Keep going! Keep going! >> Get your hands off her, you! [Screams] >> These are the kind of places that marienos didn't have the time to clean up. >> It's a real pity. We must change our clothes. We're too visible like this. >> But I'm hungry. >> You're always hungry. Come on move. [Women screaming] [Dramatic music] [Moaning] >> I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anything. I don't, I don't know. I don't, I don't, don't! >> Yes, sir? >> Where can I get swords? Some weapons? >> Well, the best metal on the market would be two stalls on the right hand side. Just opposite the stairs. >> Thank you. You want to buy some meat? >> No, no. >> Meat. Fresh meat. Fresh meat! Buy some fresh meat! >> Cabot. Want some? >> No. Thanks, I'm vegetarian. Thanks very much. [Indistinct chatter, yelling] >> I got 'em all! From Portsmouth, gamar, grimaldy, witness, and winters! And now, for your pleasure. Take your woman to your field. So what have I got for this piece of merchandise? Turn around, wench. Twenty, I hear over here. Twenty-five and twenty-five, I've got. Do I hear thirty-five? And twenty-five, I've got twenty-five. Fifty-five, who's gonna? [Woman wailing] [Upbeat music] >> Sir? [Unintelligible taunting] >> You know... Sooner or later, they're gonna spot US with these clothes. You pay for this? You thief. >> Take her away for the price. Bring up the next one. >> You. >> You'll never take me. >> Bitch! [Slap] [Yelps] >> What the hell do you think you're doing? Stop beating up on the merchandise! >> Get out of there! You're next! Come on! >> So who'll start me up on this slave here? Right. Back you go. Where is that slave girl with the long hair? >> This one. Up! Up, girl! >> No! No! Let me go! >> You're next. >> Get off me! >> Who'll start me off at seventy-five? Seventy-five, I'm gonna start at seventy-five. [Struggling] >> Get up in there. >> One hundred on that side up front over there. What do I hear on this side? >> I'll give you one fifty for her. >> Come here, wench. Come here, wench. What? Oh, oh, look how lively she is under these rags. Two hundred, I hear on this side. Two hundred once. Two hundred twice. Sold to this trader on my right. Take her away to the branding iron. >> This must stop. [Heroic music plays] >> Yaw! Yaw! Yaw! >> Let me go! >> Off you go. He-yaw! He-yaw! He-yaw! He-yaw! He-yaw! >> [Inaudible] You're only a cheap little slave girl. The desert will conquer them all right. All right, let's go. Allow me to give you pleasure. I'm not your master. >> Am I not beautiful? >> You're, you're very, very beautiful. But, i'm, I'm in love with >> in love? She, she feels for me and I feel for her. And we're free to express it. And now, you are free. >> A woman may be free to feel for whom she wants? >> Well, in, in my world, it is so. And it shall be here, too. >> You're a very strange warrior. >> Maybe. Maybe. Let's go to sleep now, huh? [Eerie music plays] >> Move. >> Open the gate! Guard: Out of the way. Would you like a guided tour your highness? >> Lead on. >> We work them all day and all night. They don't know the difference between the sunrise or sunset. >> Good. Let them learn as I did. >> And what did you learn? >> Power is all. Some are born to be whipped. Some born to rule. >> Work! Work! Get to work! Slave: Cave in! >> What's happening? >> The ceiling's starting to crumble. The workers will be crushed. >> Open the gates. >> Wait. >> But, your majesty it's a slide. >> We have plenty more slaves where they came from. The work mustn't stop. Send them back. >> Close the exits. [Crashing] >> Let those who are alive carry out the dead. Am I not right? >> You gave the order. >> I think you would enjoy to see me suffer. The way I now enjoy seeing others suffer. The hunter has returned. >> Go meet the hunter. And bring me back my prize. See that more slaves are sent to the mine. The work must continue. >> The enemy of the state no longer walks free. Tarl cabot is yours, your majesty. Yours. To destroy. >> I do not want him destroyed. Lead him to the cells. >> You heard the queen. Obey her. >> Ost. >> Hmm. >> Now. Are you satisfied? >> I shall never be satisfied. 'Til you kneel before me. And accept me fully. As your queen. >> I am but a humble priest, I kneel only before my god. [Slaves yelling] He must be killed. He will destroy our power. >> My power. He's a greater threat dead than alive. You see how they worship him? We must not make him a martyr. >> Dead, the people will soon forget him. Alive, his strength will grow. >> Keep moving. >> Don't worry, cabot. I'll be okay. I'll get out of here. >> I'm sorry, talena. You're alive. >> Talena. >> Come along. >> How bad did they hurt you? They can't hurt me. >> Let him go. I'm sorry, cabot. I, I... [Somber music plays] [Wincing] >> Cabot? >> Ah, and three more. >> Seven. >> Bring in the prisoner. >> Yes, sir. I have come to make a deal with you. Feed him. Enough. >> I am prepared to set you free. If, you promise to leave koruba and return to your own planet. If you give me your word. I will let you go. >> I don't deal with butchers. >> That's enough. You fool. If you don't go. I will have you killed. >> I said, no deal. >> Freedom. Or? Help him eat. >> Eat. >> Ah, there you are. I will see cabot now. >> I would not advise that your excellency. >> And why not? >> He must, remain in solitary longer. As further punishment. >> Nonsense. Go forth, get him for me. >> Haven't you guys had enough yet? >> Get up, slave. Up! >> What have you done to the prisoner? Answer me. >> He was offered an opportunity, your highness. He refused. He was then, disciplined. >> What are you talking about? What opportunity? What did you offer him? >> Freedom, your highness. If he would only return to his own planet. >> Freedom? But, he is my prisoner to be handled as I so wish. >> I know. And he will destroy US. Because you are behaving like a bitch in heat. And not like a queen. >> Get out of here. Get out of here! You disgusting worm. >> A pleasure. Your royal highness. [Ambient music plays] >> You're a lucky slave. >> There are no more slaves. >> In my empire. Nothing else. I could have had you killed. >> I'm sure that xenos would be delighted to do your dirty work. >> No one does my dirty work for me. >> Oh? Good help is hard to find these days, huh? >> Bring him. The people continue to hold their faith in you. Your love. I can make you their martyr. Or I can make you a better offer. >> Like the one you did to watney? >> I can show you pain. Or I can show you pleasure. >> With you it doesn't make any difference. >> Do you not want me? I can make you far more than a slave. With the turn I control the people. And you know that is power. And the turn will only listen to me. So, why not make it easier. You were a hero once to the people. I can make you a hero again. Together, our power. Could be invincible. And no one would stand in our way. >> Xenos? >> He's gone too far. But you. You. Can have a kingdom. You could love me. Your choice? >> Return me to my cell. Then they must know who you really are. An alien. And a murderer. Your options are limited now. You must confess to the murder of merianos. King of koruba. Confess. [Winces] >> Wake up. Wake up. [Villagers chatter] >> Sit. Sit down. >> Over here. Over here. [Jeering] >> Everybody rise. All kneel to Lara. Queen of koruba. >> Kneel. >> Kneel down. >> Send in the challengers. >> But first, my queen. We must appease the spirits above. We must drink a toast to the gods of carnage. We shall drink to the death of tarl cabot. >> I shall join you in your prayer. >> To the gods above. May they bless our land. Forever more. [Foreboding music plays] >> To the gods. May they bless koruba [people clamoring] Now. Kill him. [Crowd clamoring] >> Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Get him! Yeah, get him! [Crowd cheers] >> Stop him! [Brawling, grunting] >> Enough killing! Peace! >> Kill him! Send in the hunter! Kill him! >> Stop! Your queen Lara is the assassin. >> Lara killed merianos. >> It's true. Lara killed merianos. >> Do as I bid! Kill him! He speaks lies! Kill them all! >> Freedom! Crowd: Freedom! >> Freedom! Freedom! [Triumphant music] Talena! [Romantic music] >> This time, tarl cabot, I'm not gonna let you get away from me. >> I won't leave you anymore. I promise. >> But it seems your friend, watney, has no such plans of surrendering. He's in a hurry to get home. >> Don't worry about watney. >> What's it like to be king? >> Oh. It's a... A big responsibility. >> You mean, I'm a big responsibility. >> The stone. [Thunder cracks] I don't believe this. Where the hell am I? [Traffic sounds] Cop: What the...? Hey, who's the guy in drag? >> Where am I? What the hell? I don't, I don't believe this. [Cars honking] I do not believe this. Where's cabot? I... oh, hi. Have you guys seen cabot or talena or... Anywhere? >> Yeah, buddy. >> What? What? Hold on. Listen -- >> it must have been one hell of a party. >> I just got back from koruba. No, no, really. I was down in koruba. >> Yeah, yeah, buddy. >> I'm serious, you know. Now, now, really, see, I was looking for a good time so, we were in cabot's car and boom, all of a sudden, we're in this desert, you know? You know what I mean? And, and ten thousand nomads are chasing US. And cabot fought them, I mean. Six hundred of these guys, he takes out. I take care of the rest. Boom, I'm like, first we see Lara, you know? And we get there and marlena... And then xenos, he's a priest, you know? A real dude, you know, dressed in drag and everything. And me, well, I see Lara. Lara's great, but she's kind of turned on by... [Chatter fades] [Epic music]
