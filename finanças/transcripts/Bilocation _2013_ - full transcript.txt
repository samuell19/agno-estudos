(Russian) 19th century. A church in Europe. No. No no no no! Is this the best I can do? If I don't show all my skill and experience with this picture, it'll all be for nothing! This is my last chance. I can't give up. I can't. No matter what. No matter what. No matter what! Kirimura Nice to meet you! I'm Takamura. I just moved in on the 5th floor. I'm sorry. No, I am. Er, what's that on your face? I'm painting a picture. Oh. You're painting? Yes. That encounter changed my life. < Bilocation > - Sorry! - Sorry. - You OK? - Yeah. Quick! Shinobu! Shinobu! Oh no! It's OK. - I'll do it. - No, it's OK! It's OK, I'll do it. You just sit. Only I can decide what I'll do. No kidding! Let's eat. He and I... Masaru and I got married. A simple greeting turned into a relationship. It surprises even me. "Takamura" Here. Hang in there. You too. Take care. But I guess life's like that. Even so, I didn't give up on my art. I kept my apartment, and kept painting. This is my last chance. I can't give up. I can't. No matter what. "Drycleaners" I'm sorry, I forgot my receipt. Just write your name on that pad. OK. "Kirimura" "Takamura" Sorry, I wrote my maiden name by mistake. Why?! Stop saying that! You haven't even met her. Meet her. Just once. I'm still not used to my new last name. Must be our shabby newlywed life. I'm sorry. I'll make my parents accept you. If they don't, I'll cut ties with them. No, it's not that... We'll move somewhere bigger and start married life over. I'm happy the way things are. I need my place till the competition. By the way, did you go to Kaede Street today? Maybe it was just my poor eyesight, but I thought I saw you. I only went to the drycleaners today. "Account Balance: 98,620 yen" That's 1,480 yen. What is this? You gave me this note before. And this one just now. Same serial. They're fakes, aren't they? Fakes? We get a lot around here lately. The cops told me to report shady people. I'm innocent. Innocent? It must be a mistake! Detective! I found the culprit. No! This must be... I'm Kano, Yamanashi Police. Thank you for cooperating. I'll take it from here. What's going on?! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! That wasn't me on the security video. Don't worry. I know it wasn't you. What? Then why... Look. She's the same. A fake. Found her. She's the one. I'll bring her in now. Where are we going? Ever had this happen? Somebody you pass by on the street looks at you strangely. Like Hey, didn't I just see you before? I've been looking for you. We meet at last. Please go in. The rule's one at a time. You first. At the back, on the right. A rare newcomer today. If this is some cult, I'm not interested. Welcome. This is a meeting for people with bilocations. Bilocation. Another self that appears in your proximity. A.K.A. Simultaneously Existing Incarnations. They've been sighted and studiedaround the world since the early 19th century. Doppelgangers don't interact with humans, but bilocations do. They appear, assume physical form, and take action. They are perfect mimics, even of voices. But being fakes, they eventually disappear. Bilocations have the memories of the original person. They also obtain their new memories. Other people can't tell the difference between them. My bilocation slept with my girl. I had no idea. The original doesn't share the bilocation's experiences. They are unaware that their life is being altered. This is... ...a meeting for bilocation victims. I'm Takashi Kano. As you know, I'm a detective. Takumi Mitarai. I'm a student. Mayumi Kadokura, housewife. You'll be fine. I'm the organizer, Iizuka. Shinobu... From now on, do as I say. I'll do my utmost to protect you. Why? Why do you know my name? We've been watching you. I've never even seen this other self. And I don't believe you. Her bilocation! It's here! Find it! Believe me. I want to help. That's all. Was that the first time you saw it? From the look of it, it hasn't been around for long. It first happened to me when I was about your age. After I had my son... - Gas mask. - Yes Doctor. He had an incurable disease, which he struggled with from birth. I quit my job to stay by his side. I got little sleep or rest. And then... ...it appeared. At first, people told me they saw me somewhere. Just ordinary sightings. But then, one day... My son was found outside the hospital. He'd had a seizure, and was near death. Why did you let him out?! "Patient Leave Applicant: Mayumi Kadokura" The person who took my son... ...was me. Well, strictly speaking, it wasn't me. It was my bilocation. After that, it began to abduct my son frequently. I've done everything I can to protect him ever since. Why...does that woman try to endanger my son's life? Over and over again? Sorry, that's enough about me. What about you? What do you do? I'm...painting a picture. That's your job? No, it's not a job. It's for a competition. I want to go professional. I'm living off my savings from my old office job. Are you married? Where is he?! Where's my son?! Where is he?! Where is he?! Give him back! Give me back my son! Give him back! Give him back! Be careful. They'll take what's most dear to you. What's most dear to me... My other self... I know I saw it. If it's near me, how long has it been there? What does it want? What's most dear to me... I brought something. For your protection. It's a mirror for detecting bilocations. They have no reflection. A mirror? Look. I'm the real thing. I've already checked you. You check when you meet us too. It's the only way to tell. Alright. Mr. Kano? What are they trying to take from you? I heard that's what they do. They've... already taken it from me. I was a candidate for promotion. And I would've got it too... Don't you get it?! However, that door closed. The chief detective was attacked. By my bilocation. He'd been too hard on me, but I'd bottled my anger. His ribs were smashed. I was...demoted. I lived for that promotion. I want to kill that son of a bitch. Bye now. I'm praying that you don't become like me. Bye now. I'm praying that you don't become like me. No. No no no... Hey, wait. Wait! Wait, I said. You want to kill me? You idiots. Don't make me laugh! We'll kill you before you kill us. You OK? I'm the real me. I bought a bunch of food. Thanks. Sure you don't need a doctor? I'm fine. I fell, that's all. Anyway, I don't want to go out. Ow! Oh yeah, I saw her again. Who? Just now, on Kaede Street. Your dead ringer. It's probably my eyesight though. That's right. My other self's nearby. Which means, it must be near Masaru. Please let me join you. Aren't you still hurt? I'm fine. Alright, Shinobu. Allow me to explain the rules. We have two. They're simple. When you come here, we'll check you in the mirror at the entrance. The other rule is that when we meet, you recite the names of all members. Iizuka, Kano, Kadokura, Mitarai... Kagami. ...Kagami. It's like our code. You must say it when we meet. Where's Mr. Kano? He's too hurt to come. It really attacked you too? Kano's bilocation nearly killed me. Holy shit. Please tell me. Why are bilocations so vicious? Kano's is an exception. Why? Different origins. They're said to emerge when we're torn between conflicting emotions. Shithead! Kano endured his unreasonable boss, until it broke him. You're no detective! I'll kill that son of a bitch! No matter what! No matter what! No matter what! The conflicted emotion of the original. Fierce hatred. Kano's bilocation was born from it. Bilocations have more intense personalities. Like a concentrated version. Kano's bilocation is far more violent than himself. How long until they disappear? It's irregular. But the by-products created with them last for a fixed amount of time. By-products? For example, the items they're holding when they appear. They last exactly 23 minutes and 57.226 seconds. One thing we do know is that they can only exist near the original. Near means... Within a 1,414.2135-meter radius of the original. About 1.5 kilometers. That's their limit. Kagami's our oldest member, and he's studied them. So, they disappear if you get far away from them? It's no use. Even if you do, they reappear near you. Anyway, Kano's bilocation is dangerous. It might target us too. Be vigilant for now. If any of you encounter them, you must obey my instructions. I'm guarding you. Mr. Iizuka sent me. If it bugs you, I'll stay back. It doesn't, but... Hey, do you hate having another self? Who on earth would want that? Why not? The fake one's still you. Splitting your time would be cool. Why should I let it have its way? If you die, your other self might live on. Then it'd be the real you. That's why I don't care. There's no distinction. No difference. I was almost killed! Let my life be stolen by an impostor? Like hell I will. I'll be fine. Guard duty's over. Masaru? Hi. Hi. Hello? We've got a problem. Not painting today? I don't feel like it lately. Can I take a look? Sure. Want to meet my parents at the end of this month? I hate hiding from them like this. It's time we did something. Won't it be a disaster? We can handle it. Alright. 3 people have been shot outside Kofu Station. The shooter, a policeman, fired his service pistol 3 times. He is barricaded inside this building for unknown reasons. The suspect is Takashi Kano, aged 38, an active duty Yamanashi Police officer. Mr. Iizuka? What is this? Name our members. Iizuka, Kano, Kadokura, Mitarai, Kagami. Good. I need you here now. That bastard... It's going on a rampage. It's copied your hatred. Like some kind of transfer. Come on! Come at me! We have to act now. We'll catch it. Capture it? Capture it? It'll just vanish and then reappear. We'll kill it. If we kill it, maybe it won't come back. Even if it is a fake, you're going to kill it? It'll just disappear. I'll do it. My life's over anyway. I don't care anymore. I'm going to kill that bastard. Kano has vanished! Police were unable to find him. How can that be? It's coming. It'll materialize near me! I know where to go. Let's move. When it appears, call out. Got it? Iizuka and Kano have gone mad. Maybe you... don't know it yet, but bilocations gradually drive people crazy. I'm not sure of myself either. I don't know what mine will do. I'll be... ...stalked by it forever! Bilocation! Show yourself, fake! Who...are you? Who the hell are you?! Out of my way! Get off me! It's here! I caught it! Shoot! It's really me! Please! Believe me! It's really me! Shoot! Shoot it now! Don't! Don't! Don't shoot! Shoot. You've done it. You've done it. It can't be... He was the original? Killing me is futile. Your bilocations will have their revenge! You'll all be killed. Just as I was. This is war! What? What revenge?! They'll attack us like Kano's did? Where can we go? Calm down! Don't be rash. Act normally. And when they appear, you'd better tell me. What's up? I'm leaving. Huh? Only until the competition. I just want to paint. Don't contact me. But my parents... I can't go. I... ...love your paintings. I'm your fan. I can't see as well as most people, but some things I can see. Only one thing's true. I love you. How...can I... ...keep my sanity? Susumu? Take this mirror. When I come, look at me in it. If you don't see me, it's not me. Pay no attention to her. Can you do it? New combinations drive today's innovation revolution. They use knowledge that hasn't generally been used to date, and so it does not have to be new. In short, old knowledge suffices. For example, producing new goods, new production methods, new market development... Name our members. Iizuka, Kano, Kadokura! Situation? It's here! What do I do?! Do nothing. Are you nuts?! Listen up. Just don't attack it. I'm gonna survive. No matter what. Get this straight. I'm the real me. If I get cut, so do you! Mr. Iizuka? Situation? What should I do? It's right here! Do nothing! Get away from the door! You mustn't open it. I can't take it. How long do I have to keep running? Shinobu, I can sense it. Of all of us, you're in the most danger. But you've got to believe me. I'll do my utmost to protect you. Susumu, let's go! Quickly! You're not Mom! Susumu? Susumu?! If things keep going like this, I'll end up killing him. I'll kill him. I just can't, not that! No matter what. No matter what. No matter what. I won't let you. I'll protect my child. No matter what. No matter what. No matter what. You're not Mom! Susumu?! Susumu? Where are you? Mom! Susumu? Susumu? Mom! Susumu! Thank God! Thank God! The fake ran away. Are you OK? You're not hurt? Yeah. Why? Why did I... Iizuka can't be trusted. He's not trying to stop them attacking us, he's making it happen. Iizuka... ...must have wanted Kano dead knowing he was the original. He told me to kill him. Does he even have a bilocation of his own? It seems that he doesn't. But... ...he said his dead wife had been stalked by one. He told me that once. That asshole... He doesn't have a bilocation? Don't try to hide from me! He's the fake?! You OK? I'll kill you. I wish you never existed! I wish you never existed! I wish you never existed! Today at around 4pm near Kofu Main Street, a young woman was stabbed to death. She suffered numerous chest and stomach wounds, and was pronounced dead at a hospital. The assailant is thought to be at large. Police have begun a search based on witness reports. Name our members. Iizuka, Kagami. Did you have Kano killed... ...on purpose? I did. He was too dangerous. I had to keep you under control. Killing him equals control?! Are you mad?! I'll say it again. I'm protecting you. Protecting us? How?! Hating them is not the answer. Believe in me. I want to help. That's all. He's lost it too. What are you going to do now? Fulfill my purpose, as always. Purpose? The others are concluded. You're the last one. Time for your conclusion. What do you mean? Shinobu... If you could choose, would you be an artist? Or a wife? Which matters more? What are you talking about? Answer me. Your conclusion depends on it. Masaru. I'll come when it's time. You're married, but you don't wear a ring? My hands... Charcoal makes them dirty. Wear one. It means more than you know. Shinobu? Sorry. I told you not to call, yet here I am... What's up? I... ...don't want to burden you. But... To be honest, I want to be with you. Let's live together. Give up your apartment. Meet my parents this time. Sure. But... ...don't quit. Your paintings... I love them. Alright. The competition's soon. Hang in there. Wait. Yeah? I... ...want a wedding ring. Sure. This apartment represents who I was in my twenties. I'm giving it up. No matter what'll happen to me from now on. No more being afraid. I won't lose to myself. I'm... ...going to be with Masaru. No matter what. So long, me. Where are we going? The place where Iizuka met his wife, and where she now lies. You OK? Feeling sick? I taste cigarette smoke, even though I quit. I'm fine. This is where you'll find the truth. Iizuka's family invested in this facility. 10 years ago, he married a woman named Sayuri Mitamura. They met at this sanatorium. "Sayuri Mitamura" "Died May 17th, 2004" This is the grave of Iizuka's wife? No. Not this one. "Sayuri Iizuka" "Died May 17th, 2004" This is his wife's grave. That was Sayuri Mitamura's. She was a patient here. After 25 years shut in her room, she died in this place. How could that be? How could Iizuka have married her? She wasn't the woman he married. What are you saying? Iizuka lost his wife right before his eyes. Sayuri Mitamura killed herself. And her other self... ...realized she was free to roam the outside world and be happily married... Iizuka was in love with an illusion. She was a bilocation. "Sayuri Iizuka" "Sayuri Mitamura" Iizuka made a vow. To help you coexist with bilocations. He protects you and them, and our group gives him control. And then there's me. I belong to the group, but I have no bilocation. I'm an ordinary human. So why... ...am I part of the group? Figured it out? That riddle... ...is for you to solve. You came right on time. Who...are you? Pleasure to meet you. I'm Kagami. Kagami? Who was that young man who called me there? You're no longer in danger. It won't hunt you again. So... I don't have to obey Iizuka anymore? It wasn't his intention to protect you from your bilocation. He was trying to keep you away from someone. Someone? I don't get it. Kagami... "Kirimura" Uh-huh. What? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What? Really? You're sure? Congratulations. Your painting's been selected. At the back, on the left. Name our members. Tell me. Who is that on the 6th floor? Miss Kirimura. Your other self. She's a budding artist, and continues to live alone. You only went to the 6th floor to paint. That's why you never noticed her. Isn't that right? Mrs. Takamura. The first one of you to come here was Miss Kirimura. Kano was looking for her, and Sakaki checked her in the mirror. At the back, on the right. The room on the right. On the right? We have two support groups. One for originals, and one for bilocations. One uses the red room. The other uses the green room. Mrs. Takamura, that's the room you entered. As did Kagami. He only comes to the green room. He's an exception. Who...are you? Who...are you? Those who use the red room don't know him. Our members. Iizuka, Kano, Kadokura! Ergo, when you recite members' names, it tells me what you are. Kagami... It's the only way to distinguish between you. What about the mirror? Haven't you been using it? It's not enough. Only originals and ordinary people like Sakaki can see if there's a reflection or not. Bilocations can see their own reflections. That's because they mistake themselves for the real person. Mrs. Takamura... On that day... The day you first saw your other self... ...you saw yourself in our mirror. If you only saw your own reflection, you are the original. If you saw both reflections, Try to remember... ...what you saw in the mirror. I'm... ...the bilocation! I came to realize in time. We've got a problem. That the two of you, Shinobu Kirimura and Shinobu Takamura, were in exactly the same situation as my wife... as Sayuri had been. I won't let a tragedy like that happen again. I... ...tried to keep you away from Miss Kirimura, and your husband Masaru. Get away from the door! I tried to keep your husband and Miss Kirimura apart. I want to help. That's all. I want to help your husband. A man who fell in love with an illusion, like I did. Shinobu? Who is it? Shinobu? I don't know this man's voice... No, I do. It's the voice of my husband. Shinobu? For you. Sorry it's late. We're going to meet them next Sunday. My parents. Good morning, Miss Kirimura. This is where you'll find the truth. Huh? This... isn't mine... "Window" "by Shinobu Takamura" Who's that? Who's Shinobu Takamura?! The Grand Prize goes to Window by Shinobu Takamura! Thank you. Yours was rejected. They presumed that some other person had copied her motif. Why? Why? Why are you crying? That's you up there. This is my last chance. I can't give up. I can't. No matter what. No matter what. No matter what! The truth is, I hate this. I can't take it any more. I have to stop doing this! I have to. No matter what. No matter what. No matter what! If you'd answered the door at that moment, you probably would've married Masaru. I'm sorry. Not your bilocation... ...but you. A loving husband changed you. Your life. And your art. And now you're standing on that stage. There's no distinction between you. No difference. Are you really sure? Yes. I'll choose my own conclusion. Think you're a god, do you?! You ruined our lives! Why don't you get it?! You'll be safe if you accept it! Why won't you let go of your life?! We came to a compromise. You can't understand my pain. I want you to... ...have my life. I'm... someone who doesn't exist. I'll give up my life. It's the right thing to do. Even so, Masaru... Become Shinobu Takamura. For my sake... ...live my life! I'm begging you! Are you serious? You want me to marry some guy I've never met? Who's Takamura? If you're... If you're me, you know! I've never been with a man! For so long... For so long, art's been the only life I've known! I don't need art. That prize, my future as an artist, you can have it. You can have it all! So please... Give me time to think. Congratulations on your win. Now we can finally live like a proper married couple. I'm sorry for everything. Me too. I bet you'll choose this one. I'm sorry. Only I can decide what I'll do. No kidding! What was that? Only one thing's true. I love you. Shinobu? "Asami Mizukawa" "Kento Senga" "Sho Takada" "Kenichi Takitoh" "Yosuke Asari" "Wakana Sakai" "Kosuke Toyohara" "Executive Producer Shinichiro Inoue" "Executives in Charge of Production Naohisa Yamashita" "Masahiko Mizuguchi Kenichiro Kimura" "Hiroshi Yamamoto Junichi Katsuki Hidenori Ueki" "Produced by Takeshi Yasuda" "Based on the Novel Bilocation by Hojo Haruka" "Director of Photography Yuta Tsukinaga" "Lighting Director Masahiro Kimura" "Sound Recording by Fumihiko Yanagiya" "Production Designer Emiko Tsuyuki Toshimichi Kurokawa" "Edited by Masaki Murakami" "Music by Hiroaki Tsutsumi" "Bilocation Film Partners" "A KADOKAWA DAIEI STUDIO Film Production" "Written and Directed by Mari Asato" "2014 Bilocation Film Partners" I want you to... ...have my life. I'm... someone who doesn't exist. I'll give up my life. It's the right thing to do. Even so, Masaru... Become Shinobu Takamura. For my sake... ...live my life! I'm begging you! Are you serious? You want me to marry some guy I've never met? Who's Takamura? If you're... If you're me, you know! I've never been with a man! For so long... For so long, art's been the only life I've known!

Only one thing's true. I love you. Shinobu? What's up? What is happening? Shinobu Kirimura is dead. But Shinobu Takamura is alive. Maybe a new life makes Shinobu stays. The new life won't vanish, so does Shinobu. When human is torn between conflicting emotions, Bilocations appear. We live, Bilocations exist. They take over the lives. But I believe... This is the world we coexist with them...
