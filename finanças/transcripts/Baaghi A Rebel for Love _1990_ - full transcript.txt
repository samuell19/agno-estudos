It's for someone else. Hello! How are you? - I'm sending you Jaggu? - Do not. I came on my own. Why did you come? I like it. - What do you like? - Look at you. Meet me. - Is your house nearby? - No, in Juhu (Mumbai) Where is Juhu? Do not you know where Juhu is? The beach near Santacruz is called Juhu. Is your house near the beach? Amazing! Have not you seen the beach yet, Paro? My name is not Paro. They gave me that name. If your name is not Paro, what is it? Kaajal. Kaajal? Shit! If you had told me before, I would not have made this mistake. - That mistake? - I would not have brought this. For you would have brought Kaajal (eyeliner) - I'm glad you did not. - Why? It would not have been useful. You came here of your own free will, Kaajal? How about? It is very beautiful. Use it. Please. Thank you. Why do you say thank you? - For accepting the gift. - With a condition. The next time you come, do not bring me any presents. Are you sure you'll come back? Kaajal? Can I come back .. to see you again? Returns. Returns! Returns! For sure come back! That's all you guys. Girls tell you .. ... to every man who comes to the brothel Dhanraj. Returns! Returns! But do not run away with our girls. Today this guy tried to run away with this girl. Another more can do it soon. And what will your pimps have? Just think! Think! Think! One by one, if our girls .. Female dog! If they run away with their lovers. Who will you force to enter the business? Will you put your offer? No one will give you a penny! Stop looking at my eyes and look at my shoes. This idiot ran away with our girl. Did you think you'd escape our clutches? You could? Hey?! You could?! Son, this world is very big and long. But Dhanraj's hands are longer. Hey, lover boy! Girls like that are just for fun .. for nothing else. What do you think? That you thought? That Dhanraj opened this brothel .. ..to Romeos like you come and marry my girls? I run a brothel, not a marriage agency! Female dog! If you die That will stop the other girls from wanting to go. And my business will not suffer. You will die! Yes, you will! Give to me! Take off your gag. So every lover who comes here, can hear their cries! Dhanraj! Unfortunate! Rascal! We cursed you! May you die at the hands of a lover! Lovers, my ass! Oh God! - What? What happened, sir? - What did the world become? A girl was burned in the middle of the road .. .. after being rose with gasoline. - Oh God! - Look, this is the picture of the girl. She certainly did not even know what the world was. The second case in 6 months. There was a similar case before. Sir, the funeral pyre of whoever did this, it burned soon. Do you want me to bring you tea? Yes, and listen, send yourself to the madam above. Hey soldier! - A no, two cups of tea! - Officer! Friend! You are welcome! You are welcome! - A lot of time has passed. - Just passing by .. ..and thought about visiting. Soldier, do it for the police. Must be first class. Tell me Colonel. - Like this sister-in-law and Saajan? - Both good. - But I'm in a bad mood. - Why? - Because of your fault. - Mia? Why? - You read about this girl? Yes. What a police commissioner you are! Do something. Colonel, I can do many things but .. ... of all these crimes is Dhanraj. - Dhanraj? - He's a very big gangster. He has brothels all over town. He catches and kidnaps girls, and forces them to treat people. That sirvenguenza has a vast and flourishing business. But Colonel, the most disappointing thing is that .. .. we have no evidence against it. Because not just thugs, there are many cops involved with it. Oh I see. Yes. - Not just thugs, cops too. Yes. - Then there is only one solution. - Which? The army in charge, shoot him and kill the damn bastard. No Colonel. There is no need for the army in charge. Look, sir. You will not find another girl like that around here. I like it! I like it! Pure, sir, pure! Send you something to eat, sir? There is no need for that. Virgin! What trap did you put me in ?! This girl is absolutely crazy! Not a word, and she hit me with a bottle! What happened, sir? Sir, what happened? If she does not know how to do anything, why are you sending me with her? - Tell me, rogue! - No, sir, the girl is not crazy! But since she arrived, she has driven us crazy. I will teach you a lesson today! I will straighten it, I will not let it do what I want! Trying to make you alive? - Will you agree or not? - What are you doing? - You gonna kill her? - Yeah, I'll kill her! Trying to make herself alive, this bitch is ruining my business! Today she scare away a regular customer! She is ruining our business! The damn bitch! Who does he think he is? Jaggu! Jaggu! Calm down! Calm down! Everything will be fine! Everything will be all right, eh? When Dhanraj .. .. come and get the money, you will answer? Yes, I will respond. I will respond. Think Leela, think about it. Your love for her will end up being expensive. Love is expensive, Jaggu. But for those who know love it is not. Do not cry, daughter. Do not Cry. If there was power in the tears .. This brothel would have sunk long ago. Hello! Are you sleeping? Kaajal? You are asleep Look, I came back. Hello? Kaajal? Kaajal? What? Oh my goodness! Jaggu hit you again? No one beats that way even to an animal. Shit! What kind of man is he? I will break your bones! - That is useless. - What do you mean? I consider this to be my destiny now. It seems.. What are you beating This humiliation and this dark room is my destiny. Do not! This is not your fate Kaajal! This dark room, this humiliation is not your destiny. Outside this dark room, there is a huge world. Which is very beautiful... which is your destination. Yes, which is your destiny. I have seen nothing but these four walls, Saajan. Let's go now. But Saajan, they will not let us go. "I'll live to Jaggu alive." - Do not tell him anything. Just ask Madam Leela. Madam Leela. Madam Leela. I.. - I want to go out with Paro. - You want to run away with her? No, I just want to walk with her. Walk outside with her! Moron! Boy, do not do anything wrong. If anything happens to him, Dhanraj will not have mercy on you. - Not me.. - Forget the boss, Madam Leela. For the... I am enough. I can with 10 guys like him. Look Madam Leela, I'll just take Paro for a ride. Hey! Do you dare look at me? Do you think you're a real idiot ?! - Come on, go. "Madam, tell him not to touch me!" Jaggu, he wants to take Paro's ride. Leave it alone. If you say so Madam Leela. Come on .. give me money. Come on. Money? Where you come from? Do you think she will be free? Give me 2000Rs. Come on! - 2000Rs? - What happens? Do you leave the idea of the ride? No. I do not have 2000Rs now. - I have to make the arrangements. - Yes, good. Come back when you've done it. Come on, go. Madam Leela, take care of Paro. Saajan? You got 200Rs out of my wallet? - Yes sir. - Why? - It was an emergency, sir. - What emergency? - Why did you steal it? - Saajan? Why do not you talk? Why did you take the money? - Why did you steal it? - Enough! For the love of God! It must have been an emergency. Otherwise, he has never done this before. I know what the emergency was! He wanted money for his vices! So he started to steal! But Colonel Sood's son could never be a corrupt! I will not tolerate it! If you give the one rupee .. ... you will face my anger. Can you hear me?! From now on, he will not be given an allowance! You understand? Come on. It's enough. Come on. Go away! I have seen nothing but these four walls, Saajan. Where you come from? Do you think she will be free? Give me 2000Rs. Come on. If you give the one rupee .. ... you will face my anger. Can you hear me?! From now on, he will not be given an allowance! You understand? Curse! Curse! Curse! - Driver, stop the car. - Here? This is our Colonel's house. - How much is it? - 30.75Rs. Thank you. Saajan? Uncle Abdul. I'm sitting waiting .. with my hopes up. I do not know what time .. my beloved. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. I'm looking at your way. I'm looking at your way. Come, and let me see you.

Day and night, on the walls I write your name. Do not stifle me and die. Come and give hope to my heart. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. Uncle Abdul! Uncle Abdul! Saajan? I do not understand your drama. Are you a man or a ghost? You drive a taxi all night, and you go to university by day. How long will this be? If the Colonel finds out .. .. did not even care that I was his driver. And get me out of town. Why all this drama? Do not ask, Uncle Abdul. " He who falls into this drama will go mad. So much money? Did you put your hand in someone's pocket? It's my money won with a lot of effort. But what is your need, Lord Saajan? The need for Saajan does not, the girlfriend of Saajan needs it. Mr. Colonel. Saajan is totally absent from university in the last time. We are here to find out why. Sir, he does not concentrate on his studies. You must tell him that all this is not good. Guys, they scared me! We came with the intention of telling you everything. ... and submit to you to court martial. - You're lucky he is not. - Thank God! Come on, begin. Tell us everything in detail. - Come on, tell us. - About what? Your reason for not going to college. Come on baby, say it all at once. - Nothing, guys. Was occupied. - Listen, son. I have more experience than you I have had 35 romances and romance 36 is in process. - This is a symptom of "Amorsitis". - Hey! Is your mind okay? Do not hide it. Dinos, who is she? - Is it from our university? - Is it from your neighborhood? - Did you meet on the way? - Or in a hotel? - You came to talk about this? - No friend. We came to remind you of something important. - Today is Buddha's birthday. - Oh friends! There will be a party, and if you do not come .. ..we will see what we have been rehearsing. Which means, that we will complain to the Colonel about you. Hey, tell Buddha that today I can not friends. No, look, the party is today, and you have to come. Take her if you want. It's just our group. - You will come, right? - Sure, huh? I will go. Unemployment! Unemployment! Unemployment! He came! Unemployment! Unemployment! Unemployment! He came! And listen. Remember this. If you try to seduce the girl, or you think about running .. I'll bury you alive! Got it? Now get out! Jaggu, the boy seems to be from a respectable family. He would not retract his words.

Come and get my blessings. Come on! Come on! - Yes, you must. - Yes Yes Yes.. No no! Just kidding. Hey Tempo, Refill, come friends! - Hello Baby! - Refill!

Sorry, there is also a candidate here, Your Highness, if your Highness. - She does not want to dance with you. - Why not? - Why not? What would be the damage? - Mahesh, come on, mate. Your wife is with you, dance with her. - Hey Kitty, take care of him, come on. - Hey Kitty, leave me, let go. It is with her that I am going to dance. Mahesh! You're drunk! Long! Do not you dare threaten me. You bring a prostitute to our party and you threaten me ?! - What? - Yeah! What do you say friend Mahesh, why are you ruining the Buddha's feast? The idiot is calling her a prostitute! This idiot is ruining the party by bringing in a prostitute! If you say another word, I will kill you! Saajan! Everyone knows she's a fucking prostitute! She is a prostitute. Ask him where he comes from! - Saajan! Why do not you say something? - Who is she, my friend? I'll tell you! This damn prostitute .. .. comes from Forras Road. Say it! Say it! I am right? Yes, she comes from Forras road. Yes, she lives in the brothel of Dhanraj. But she is not a prostitute! She is as innocent as any of her sisters. They do not believe it, right? That a girl who lives in a brothel can be pure ?! Tell me! Do not believe?! Want a test? Hey? Want a test? Here is the proof! Here is the proof! Look at these marks. They are proof of your honesty! Of his dignity, his defenselessness and his virginity! Even everyone wants to know who she is? Where does it come from? Ask me! Ask me now! Answer! Why are they all so quiet? Answer! Nobody wants to ask anything? Nobody wants to ask anything? But I want to ask this respectable man .. .. why are you going to Forras road despite having a wife? Answer me, you bastard! Friend! This guy mistreats my Kaajal! She is my life! If you say something against her .. ..I'll kill you! Remember it! Saajan, relax. Take me back, Saajan. Take me back, come on. Let go. Kaajal. It is useless to cry and feel ashamed. You are above these people. Come with me. Honey, calm down. Kaajal? You are angry with me? - Do not. - So? So you're scared of these people who are not worth anything? That they have nothing but a heart, a mind that is worth nothing? Nothing! Only loud voices! To scream and mistreat! But they can not support anyone! They can not encourage anyone. They can not help anyone! Those who are like Mahesh should not fear them, Kaajal. They are like those stray dogs that bark at everyone. Why fear them? You should not even bother! I do not fear them, I fear for your reputation, Saajan. They will defame you. I was afraid of being defamed .. ..the day I step on the brothel of Dhanraj. But after meeting you .. .. overcome my fears, overcome everything. Except one. My dream of being one with you can not be shattered. There is a big difference between dreams and reality, Saajan. And the fact is, between you and me .. ..is Madam Leela, Jaggu and Dhanraj. When a girl can leave her house and come here .. ... neither Leela, nor Jaggu, nor even Dhanraj can stop it. The doors of a house and those of a prison are different, Saajan. The former open with the desire of oneself. The second, with the consent of the jailer. First tell me your wish. I'll take care of the rest. Is that what I should say? Do not. But tell me something. How did you fall into his trap? Saajan. It all seems like a nightmare to me. I wonder.. ..if what I am going to say .. ..you can listen. But it is true. It is my personal experience. A mountain station. A deep valley. A small house. My grandfather, my grandmother. Those who took care of me when my mother died. And my father, he was a very good person, Saajan. He was a teacher in a school. But all good things come to an end. He died. One day he went to school... and he never came back. When the breadwinner dies, Saajan, also the family. How could we manage the house with our grandfather's little pension? We started to live with just money. So I decided .. take my father's place. To work. Send requests to many places. I also received many calls. But I had no money for the ticket. I received a call from a Mumbai company for an interview. They sent me the money to travel. I felt that God had answered my prayers. I arrived in Mumbai and went to the place .. Where he was supposed to have the interview. There were many interviewers. They checked my application and asked me many questions. Who were my relatives, where my village was. I told them everything. They gave me 1,000Rs of advance to send home. The man who saw me met me outside the post. He offered me a ride. I sit in the car. Without realizing where I would end this trip. I found myself in the brothel of Dhanraj. Try to get away from that place. But it was in vain. So I decided to end my life. And suddenly... you entered. I saw a ray of hope in your eyes. I want to live, Saajan. I want to live. But not in that brothel, not in that darkness. I want to live, Saajan. I want to live. The darkness is already over, Kaajal. It's time for light. - Come on, come with me. - Where? To my house. - Mom, how am I as a son? - Very good son. You love Me? - That's a childish question. - Answer me, mama. For me, you are the most loved. Mama .. to the person I love, you love her? What do you mean? Kaajal? Mom, she's Kaajal. I love her. Come, daughter. Namaste. - Blessed. Be happy. This Saajan is a little crazy. He brought you here without telling you before. If he had told me before, he would have gone to your house. Mom, Kaajal has no house. Kaajal's parents died. So who are you living with, daughter? - I.. - Mama, Kaajal lives .. - in a brothel. - What nonsense are you talking about? It is true! And I decided that Kaajal should never go back to that brothel. - She will stay here. - This is a serious matter, Saajan. We can not decide on your life this way. Her fate was decided the day she was taken to that brothel. She came to appeal against that decision. Tell me, what are your orders for her? Scoundrel! You dare go to a brothel .. ..and bring a dirt from there? I'll flay you alive! Sir, listen to me, please. Kaajal comes from a respectable family. No prostitute could be respectable. At least you You should not mistreat it as the rest of the world does. I am no different from society. Even you have to live in this world. If this is your world, then I do not want it! I do not want a world that deprives a girl of her right. The right to be a mother, a sister, a wife! They keep it in a place where it is but a living body. A place where people come and offer a price. And then she is told that this is the world? I do not want a world like this! I do not want it! Do you dare raise my voice? - Do not you dare answer me! - Do not hit him. You are the dishonor of our family! You make a hell of our lives. - Please leave it! - I'll kill you! I will go. Do not! You will go where I go! Scoundrel! I will not spare your life! - I will not let you live! I'll kill you! - Yes, do not let me live, kill me! But I will not leave Kaajal! I will not leave her! I will not leave her! Go away! A rebel like you can not stay in my house. Go away! If loving and supporting someone is to be rebellious .. .. then I am a rebel against you, your law and your society! I'm a rebel! Yes, I'm a rebel! And now I will do what a rebel must do. Let's go, Kaajal! How do you feel? It feels good. The dream of love .. .. now it seems true. Let people say what they want, beloved. We will never break our promise. When someone has a partner like this (like you) .. .. why would she fear the world? It's my wish ... to spend happy and sad moments with you. How do you feel? It feels good. The dream of love .. .. now it seems true. Saajan? Saajan? Saajan arise, Saajan! What happens? Run! Saajan! DO NOT! SAAJAN !! What happened? Saajan, I had a very bad dream. Dream Jaggu killed you. Hey, it looks like you still have not stopped fearing Jaggu. Do not worry, Kaajal. Nothing will happen to us. Nothing will happen to us, Kaajal, nothing will happen to us. They are very dangerous, Saajan. They are very dangerous. Before, a girl tried to escape. But Dhanraj burns her alive. We can not escape them, Saajan. We can not! We can and we sure will! We'll go to the police, they can not hurt us. No. Sushmi said that Dhanraj bribes the police. Imagine if they catch us? God forbid. Then we'll get away from here. Far away. Where even the thoughts of Dhanraj can not reach us. Although not, what? The fear of him always obsesses us. And we will ask who will attack us and when. It is very difficult to live in fear, Saajan. It is very difficult. Where do you want to go? We can not go home, nor can we go to the police .. .. nor to another city. Where can we go? - To the brothel, Saajan. - To the brothel? Are you crazy?! I release you with so much difficulty. And you want to return to the clutches of death? - Never say that again! - Just for a while, Saajan. I'm going to see Madam Leela. She is very good, Saajan. Of her not being there, I do not know where I would be. Saajan, Madam Leela is very good in heart. She will surely help us. Once. Just once. Tell me, Saajan. Will you come? Yes..if she can not do anything for me .. .. then I'll do whatever you say. Tell me, will you come Saachan? Please? For me. - What do you say? - I beg you, Madam Leela. I do something to let go and never hurt Saajan. You're asking for something that no one ever got. It's impossible, daughter. There are many ways to get here .. ..but only one way out .. ..and that is death. Which paves the way to Dhanraj Street. You call me your daughter, Madam Leela. What kind of mother are you? You can not do anything for your daughter? Does this guy really love you? He left his house for me, Madam Leela. If I had a house of my own ..and would have arranged everything for the wedding. I would have put henna in your hands. And I would have sent you in a palanquin with him. But in the place that I am today .. .. from here do not come palanquines, from here come feretros. Ferrets of people .. and sometimes, ferrets of their dreams. I wonder how many people will be killed by you? Madam Leela, it is arranged that Kaajal will leave here. Being happy, not being happy. Now the decision is in your hands. There is only one way out. Go with Dhanraj. And try to convince him. Maybe your words from the heart can change your mind. - Where can I find it? - In the palace Dhanraj. Every day has a reception. - What job do you do for me? - I came with an order, sir. - Tell me, what's the order? - There's a girl in her brothel. If you. I will be very grateful. Why? She is your lost sister She has no relation to me, not to you. She is in your custody, please release her, sir. Why? You fell in love with her That's right, sir. You damn university students are idiots! The minute they see the girls .. They are ready to die for them. What is love? The need to satisfy the physical desire .. ..is the love for these respectable people. Love! Forget this. Everything is so stupid. Leave it like this. You seem to be from a respectable family. Marry a respectable girl. Why do you want to take a prostitute home? And ruin my business? Look, I'm not indulgent when it comes to business. Once a girl comes to my brothel .. .. she can not leave, do you understand? Lord, I beg you. Please release Kaajal, please sir. Oh! Do not make me angry, son. It will not be good for you, go! Lord, I'll do what you want. Say I will make money and I will give it to you. - But please release Kaajal. - What? - Will you give me money? - Yes sir. Get off! Are you buying a TV in installments? Sir, please do not say that. - Please do not disappoint me. - Get off! Get off! Moron! Chote, take this lover and throw him in the drain. Not me, you. Will go to the drain! Dhanraj! Hit him so much ..that he will not go to the brothel next time. - Take it away. - I will not leave without Kaajal. Dhanraj releases it. A true lover! Not like you. - Take him and hit him! Come on. - I will not leave! I will not leave! Let's look who it is. - He's our commander. - I could die. - Let's get him to the hospital. - Let's go, friends. Saajan? Saajan? I will not die. I will not die. Kaajal! Madam Leela! Balbir is here. Madam Leela, Balbir, Dhanraj's brother is here. You two of the seństans sitting here. I will go and see. Hey, Madam Leela. Come on! Come on! This brothel is honored. Tell me, what are your orders, Mr. Balbir? I came to see Laila. So here you are looking for Laila. Your Highness! Please sit down for a while. Have a drink. Bring Laila, Shirin, Heer, all before you. - Hey, stop. - There I go. Call all the girls outside. The boss is here. Forget about them. Where is she? - Who? - That boy went crazy. - What boy? - The one who went to see my brother. He said, "Sir, my girl is in her brothel." Release it! My butt! - Where is that boy? - The idiot must be dead already! Do not! Lord, tell me you're lying! Say you're lying! Tell me that Saajan is fine. Tell me that Dhanraj will release me. Tell me! Tell me! So this is the girl ?! Beautiful. Hey, guys! Take this girl! You can not take it with you. - No, you can not take it! - Get out. Come on, get her in the car. Balbir, you are not worthy of her. Let her go. - Why? She is your daughter? - Yes she is my daughter! Daughter, my ass! Back to work! This idiot alive! Come on! Come on! Release it. Release it, sirguy! Come on, Paro. - Take her, Sushmi. Yes. Hey, what's going on? Kaajal? Kaajal? Kaajal? Kaajal? Come on, Paro. Buddha, Time, Refill, Come on! Time, Refill, come, fast! Tempo! Let's move on! Chase them! Chase them! Get the car! Female dog! Are you involved with them? Sir, what does he do? She is my sister. Hey, mister! I told her she's my sister. What she did? What she did? I'll tell you! Now you know who did that! Hey, take the two with my brother! Hey, do not touch my sister! Release my sister! Tell the truth, Jaggu. Tell the truth. Look. I like the truth. Really, boss. Do not take any money. I do not touch anything, boss. Agree. You did not take the money. And your sister did not prick Chote's wheel either. - But that girl did not run? - I'm running. - From whose brothel? - Yours. And the news does not run through the market? Yes. - What did the news say? That girl from the brothel of Dhanraj fled before the men of Dhanraj! Tell me, do not we have a bad reputation in the market? And who is in charge of that brothel? Who? It's you! True? - Yes Boss! Yes. It means that you defamed yourself! Boss. Castigeme. Also punish me for the mistake of my sister, boss. I'll do that for sure! Because she fled, and others will want to do the same. My business was ruined. The brothel would be deserted. But in reality this idiot is my oldest helper. He was so small when I took him out of the drain. And her sister was so small .. in her arms. He is an old assistant of mine. And he's still a child. If it were another .. ..and put it in the freezer of an ice cream factory. He would have died frozen. But the punishment I think for him is incredible. His sister will .. - ..the place of that girl. - Do not! Do not! Boss, Sushmi is my sister, boss. My sister. Now you think of your sister? You forget those days in which you betrayed .. ..the sisters of others to the brothel? Oh, stop that. Non-money relationships are important in our business. - What? - Boss, give me another chance. - I'll trace them somehow. - That's not the problem. Where can they escape? I told Inspector D'souza .. .. ask questions. Speak you. - Say yes or no? - Brother! Sushmi! Sushmi! Sushmi! Boss, mercy, boss! Sushmi is my sister! Have mercy, boss! Hey, do not do it! Do not! Let go! Boss, stop them, boss! Brother! No, boss! That makes? She is my sister! Excuse me! Have mercy! Release me! Moron! You happily put the sisters of others in this business. Now, when it's your sister's turn, are you crying ?! Boss. Have mercy, boss. He is dead to me! It is better not to have children, than to have a child like him. - What is the crime of Saajan? - Kidnapping a girl. - What a Girl? - A girl from the brothel of Dhanraj. That prostitute? He made many enemies by taking that girl. He gave a terrible beating to Dhanraj's brother. And sent three of his men to the hospital. What? Saajan fought with Dhanraj's men? Yes. The beating of Dhanraj's brother and .. ... send three of your men to the hospital? Yes. - Saajan did all that? Yes. You lying, officer? The cops exaggerate things. There's no need for me to lie, sir. I could never have thought of that useless boy .. - .. would prove to be so brave. - What does he say, sir? Are you praising her for kidnapping a girl? To kidnap a girl, not to hit those thugs. Although the motives are wrong, official .. - he did a wonderful job. - Why not? Parents like you. They ruin their children. And the police are annoyed by those reasons. Maybe you. Do not understand, Inspector. I'll even tell him something. He wanted Saajan to join the army. Thus one day he would become a brave soldier. He did not join the army, but by this act he showed that .. ..he is brave and has courage! It is full moon night, you are with me. It is full moon night, you are with me. The air is a little cold, there is also pain in the heart. The air is a little cold, there is also pain in the heart. The pain is cruel, there is a conversation on the lips.

May God keep you happy, son. You brought back our granddaughter. I will never forget this favor in my life. But dear... where have you been all these days? You will not be able to hear my story, Grandma. It's worse than a nightmare. - What do you mean? - I'll tell you, Grandma. It's a terrible story. This little girl and a big city like Mumbai. And to add, a lot of work. All day she had to keep her head down. She did not have time to lift it. But dear, what job was it? - I.. - I'll tell you, Grandpa. His work was very difficult. She used to count the days. - Count the days? Yes. And counting the days is a very difficult job. - Tell me, what day is it today? - Saturday. Saturday. But in America, it's Friday. While in New Zealand, it is already Sunday. In a single day, three days! In a single day, three days, Grandpa! Then the hours, minutes and seconds of a day. Just think how hard it is to count the days. Yes. I am not surprised that my child did not have time to write to us. Rest, we'll talk later. Now let's go freshen up. - I'll show you around. - I'll make arrangements to eat. Saajan? Why did not you let me tell Grandfather the truth? It hurts to think about the past and the death. Why do you want to hurt these people? Share your happiness with them. The happiness of freedom that is in your smile. Of victory, which is now in the brightness of your eyes. You forgot to include a happiness, Saajan. The happiness of being with you. That is in the beating of my heart. What is going on brothers What? Saajan is narrating his love story to his girlfriend. Hero and heroine embrace. - Friend, break my head. - Why brother? Why? Hero and heroine embracing. What are we three doing here? We are characters in this story. - As? - You would not understand, my friend. Look, your character is already bad! We have much to do. I have to get Saajan and Kaajal married. - Why should you marry them? - Because I'm the eldest. You sit down. There are older people here. Leave it to them. Saajan, son? - Yes, Grandpa? - I want to talk to you. Son, you told me a story. But the state in which these have another story to tell. Only with the clothes you wear, you can not go on a long journey, son. My experience says... ..wherever you got Kaajal, she was in serious trouble. If you. Wants to listen .. then I am ready to tell you the truth. No, son, no. It is better if certain truths remain undisclosed. All I want to know is how long .. ..decide to support Kaajal? Grandfather. I promise to support Kaajal all my life. Saajan, son, today I feel relieved of weight. May God give both of them all the happiness of the world. The promise of love is the greatest of all promises. The promise of love is the greatest of all promises. Even after we die, we will not break this promise. The promise of love is the greatest of all promises. Even after we die, we will not break this promise. I will leave all the happiness of the world. I will leave all the happiness of the world. But I'll never leave your side.

If strong winds come, they should go back. We can also face storms. The promise of love is the greatest of all promises. Even after we die, we will not break this promise. The eyes met, and the eyelashes came down. I do not know where I got lost. The eyes met, and the eyelashes came down. I do not know where I got lost.

Saajan? Saajan, son, where are you? How are you? That's way to leave the house and go? I do not leave the house, mama. The Lord cast me. Fool boy! He is crabby, but he is not your enemy. No father is an enemy of his son! Talk to him, he will help you, take. Mom, I do not need anyone's help. The past past. Now Kaajal is free. And we'll get married tomorrow. What? Do you marry without our presence? - Saajan is getting married? - Yes mom! You fucking idiot! Unfortunate! What happened? I pick up the phone. Vandana. Where do I call Saajan? The operator said Ooty (Tamil Nadu) Let's go to Ooty. I want to see my son dressed as a boyfriend. I will not go. You know him. Whether we go or not .. ..he would surely marry. And she will become your daughter-in-law. - Colonel Sood's daughter-in-law. - Vandana, if he does not need us .. ..not then we either. We do need it. He is our son. Our only child. Your pain is ours. And his happiness is ours. Being his parents .. "It is our duty to go to your wedding." - Do not talk nonsense Vandana! I will not break my principles for a rebel! - Then you will not come? - Do not! Then do not come! Stay confined to the walls of your false principles! But take that picture you see every day. That speaks for itself! This shattered Lord Colonel! Lost in the front of the love of Saajan. And the politics of war says that the one who loses must surrender. Vandana. Today, for the first time in my life, I am in front of your eyes .. ..not knowing what to say. Let me decorate this part of your hair. Let me put the bindi on your forehead. Allow me to dress you with the red veil. Let me make you a girlfriend. Let me adorn you with my own hands. Let me hold you and love you. Let me adorn you with my own hands. Let me hold you and love you. Let me enhance your beauty. Let me put the garland of flowers today. How do you feel? It feels good. The dream of love .. .. now it seems true. Police? Who are married? The bride and groom get married, of course, sir. Shut up. Hey boy, what's your name? Saajan. But we did not commit any crime. We are marrying the consent of our elders. The name of the girl is Paro aka Kaajal? Yes. - Both of you come to the police station. What is it, sir? Did the kids do something wrong? This boy kidnaps the girl. The kidnappers do not take the girl to her house, Inspector. They take them out of their homes. And I brought Kaajal home. I do not know anything. Mumbai police report .. ... that you took part in a fight and you kidnapped this girl. They will be sent there now. - Officer, arrest them. - Listen to us. Why did they push us out? Come on! Come on! But do not run away with anyone. Come here! Come on! Come on! Hey! Move on! Hey! What is this? This girl is dressed as a bride. Hey, D'Souza! The sack of the wedding altar? If I had arrived a little later ..the two would already be married. Curse! That was wrong. That was very bad. You did not let a girl fulfill her one wish. You did not let her get married. Very bad. But there's no problem. I will fulfill it. I will fulfill your only desire of the heart. I'll have her marry. I will do it! You're very affectionate about becoming a girlfriend, right? Answer me! Hey! I will make you a girlfriend! Come on, talk! How will he speak? His mouth is covered. Hey! Take out the gag. Quick! She will be a girlfriend I will make you a girlfriend! Now talk! The bride of whom you will be? Speaks! His? That will not do you any good. You will be a widow before your henna dries. Find another! What do you think of this bare? Do not? Curse. Come here! Get off! What do you think of this fat man? And this short? Do not? Come here. Yes! Jaggu! Yes, he is perfect. The idiot still weeps in mourning for his sister. He will overcome his pain! What if! The idiot is also a pimp. Your child will also follow in his footsteps. And gradually, you will start a brothel like me. Chote, make arrangements for the sequel. And do not forget the music. What if! Get a priest to marry them. And here we will put a tent! Because our "Laila and Majnu" they marry. (Old love story) Why.. It should be a big wedding, right? All brothels should be witnesses to this, right? The wedding is serious, boss? Dhanraj never jokes! She will marry and everyone will see! Curse. She will marry a pimp! And a dozen boyfriends spend their night with her! Hey, call our important customers. And ask them to come and bid the price. Dhanraj! What madness is this ?! What does Madam Leela think? That I'm not going crazy for all this? I'm freaking out in anger! Wear it and dress it like a bride! As one would dress a horse for an auction in the market! Otherwise, there will be so many dead bodies here. ..which will be difficult to count. Do not kill anyone boss, or I will not be able to deal with the problem. What? Can not you take care of the problem? What will you do? I take care of you all my life. Release it. Go! Go away! - Chief, please. - Get out. Do not try to get me information! Those standing near the door and windows, listen well. Look how Dhanraj tear the tongue out of those who bark at him! And break the teeth of those who bite him! After seeing how they are both punished .. No girl dared to escape from here! Chote. Cut this lover in small pieces .. ..and put it in the freezer of our factory. Thus his love turns to ice. Come on. - Grab him. - Dhanraj! Dhanraj, I will not let you commit this injustice! They really love each other. Let them go! Do not do the curse! You cheated on me! You dishonored me! You pushed me here. Now, if you kill me .. ..I will not feel bad. But do not curse two lovers! Do not incur the curse. Release them. Madam Leela! Dhanraj! Go and dress her like a bride. Do not make me angry, or you run with the same fate. You see and saw Jaggu as a boyfriend. Go! - We never had a wedding here. - Come on. Today, the sequel of a pimp will come and everyone will remember me. Go and look! Come on, come on up. Kick the idiot! After he is your turn. Procurer! You will be the boyfriend after him! SUSHMI! Pardon Beloved, oh beloved, come now. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. What color did our love bring? What color did our love bring? The moment of our meeting became that of separation. What color did our love bring? The moment of our meeting became that of separation. Every time your thought comes, it makes my heart cry a lot. How will I live without you? Come and tell me. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. Beloved, oh beloved, come now. Hey! Stop! Stop! - Mr. Colonel. - What happens? Come on. - Who are you? - We are friends of Saajan. Friends of Saajan? Saajan is in Ooty. Saajan is not in Ooty, sir. She was getting married .. when the police arrested us all and pushed us out of the van. And they took Saajan and Kaajal. When we went to the Ooty Commissary, we found out .. - they never arrested Saajan. - What does it mean? It means that Dhanraj's men came in disguised as cops. And they have them here. Dhanraj will kill them, sir! Salvelos! They must be in the brothel, sir. - In the brothel of Dhanraj? Yes. But... I'm in uniform. I will change and I will go. Sir, this uniform is used to protect lives. And now two lives are in danger! The life of Saajan and Kaajal is in danger .. Do not! Go Go! Come on. Come on. Where is Chote? Where is Chote? Hey! Where is Chote? Chote? Hey! Where is Chote? Where is Chote? Where is Chote? Damn pimp! Where is Chote? Saajan! Aside! He is mine! Curse. Do not! Leave Dhanraj, Saajan. Or I shoot her. Dog! Where is Chote? Where is my brother Chote? Where is my brother Chote? Saajan! I'm here boy! Yes sir! You right, you left, you see over there! OK sir! - Let go! - No, I will not. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Saajan! Tempo! Stop! Buddha! Refill! Do not! Mr! Lord, get up. Sir, please stand up. Sir, I love him very much. Please do not leave us. Lord, I'll do what you want. Say I want it, sir. Mr! Unfortunate. A small bullet .. .. can not harm Colonel Sood of the Rajputana regiment. Yes, sir, yes.
