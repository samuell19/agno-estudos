Video Running Time 02:09:05 Google search name - Elan (Elaan) - 1947 Whatever happens is God's will. Allah is great. Allah is great. Wake up! Time for prayers. We offer prayers in the mosque. That's wrong! Stupid boy! Sit down. These boys are terrible. They don't study, nor do they allow others to. What a ruckus! Abdul Razzaq, you read that. Get up! Very good! Rascals! These boys from the community... they're absolutely worthless. They're not worried about anything. Take care of them else they'll go astray. If they don't improve, illiteracy will prevail. All they do is play. They'll regret it one day. Stop throwing mud, you idiots! Come here, all of you. - All of you are ungrateful. - What did I do, sir? What did you do? Your fathers owe me something. Someone sent 'laddoos'. They wanted to eat my share, too. All of you are useless. Sir, mom says it's bad to take interest. Shut up! So it's bad to take interest, really! Why did she let your father borrow money on interest? You shouldn't be watching. Go and study That was bad. Children shouldn't play such prank on their elders. And you shouldn't have watched them doing it. - Learn your lessons. - Yes. Your late father wanted you to study and become successful... and you waste time watching all that? If you do that again, I'll give you a thrashing. Get that clear. Study now. Mr Sajjad, repeat after me. 'I remember days of yore.' 'I remember days of yore.' - 'The dewdrops on...' - Read softly. He'll get away. 'Flowers bloom as dewdrops fall.' 'Flowers bloom as dewdrops fall.' 'Spending sleepless nights and...' Goodness! - Sajjad, where are you? - Behind you - Sajjad, where are you? - Behind you. - Where are you? Come and study. - I won't! When I find you, I'll slap you so hard that... Why are you crying? - You slapped me! - I didn't. - What happened? - Mom! - The teacher hit me! - No! Ma'am, believe me, - I didn't do that. - Sir... you are insulting us by calling him a liar. Please believe me, ma'am. I respect your husband a lot. - I wouldn't hit his son. - You should be patient. You hit my boy for no reason at all. - Greetings. - Greetings. I think Sajjad is lying. Javed is your sister's son and he studies so hard. I know that. But my son won't work as a clerk in some office. God has bestowed us with wealth. Why does he have to study? And I don't want people beating him. What will his future be if he doesn't study? Children of rich parents are always considered rich. Sir, please don't come here from tomorrow. - Ma'am... - I said, you won't come here! - Sir, I've lost a job. - No, you haven't. - You will come here. - Thank you, sir Son! Listen son. I've been calling out. Didn't you hear? What is it, dad? What do I say? Can't you see my face? - Your face is stained with mud. - I know that. Are you going to stand here and stare at my face... or will you bring water? Go and get water. Go! I've never seen such a dancer. I've heard a singer has been invited too. There are always singers. There was a birthday party at Mirza's house. There were singers and dancers there. God knows what was in the pilau. I'm feeling nauseous. Please make a 'paan' for me. - No formalities please. - Don't worry. I won't be formal at all. The food was so delicious we were left licking our fingers. I must admit, what a grand birthday celebration! That's very kind of you. Tell me who's wearing the most expensive outfit. - My mother's. - He's talking about us. Mine is the best. That's all right but mine are the most expensive. - It's your birthday. - It's not because of that. I wear such clothes every day. I'm not a beggar like you. Don't call me a beggar. - Why have you come here? - Your mother invited me. Go away from here. I don't want to play with you. Mom asked me to give it to you as a birthday gift. Gift! What are you doing? It's all right. - How dare you? How dare you hit him! - Sabira! Javed, apologise to your aunt. Sister, your son is so spoiled. You pamper him too much. Sabira, I apologise to you on his behalf. He's ignorant. He wouldn't have hit his rich aunt's son otherwise. Great! The pot calling the kettle black. Your son hit my son and you are taunting me! God knows I didn't say it with any bad intention. - I know, you're jealous of my wealth and comfort. - Sabira! - Don't make it an issue. - Why do you maintain ties with me? Sabira, don't say that in public. - I'm a human being. - I'm no monster either... to torture someone. I was wrong to come here. Did you invite me to humiliate me? The children were fighting. It wasn't anything for you to get so furious over. I'm your elder sister after all. So what if I'm poor? I swear I'll never step into your house again. Sister, where are you going? I've sworn never to come here again. I know what happened... but you're aware of my wife's nature. - She humiliated me. - I apologise on her behalf. May God bless you. We are poor. We don't deserve to be here. No sister. Don't go. Please don't stop me. Please let me go. What style! - Once sir approves... - you'll be rewarded What do I do, sir? I'm at your service. Don't say that, Dilnawaz. Please don't say that. Your simplicity breaks my heart. That's all very fine... but I'm here too. I desire your attention, too. Why did you humiliate sister? It was mean of you to do so. Forget that. Look at the kids playing. Good God! They're enacting a 'mujra'! So sweet! Didn't I tell you not to invite dancers home? It has a bad influence on the children. These traditions will cause our downfall. - I wonder what the repercussions will be. - Don't worry. Everything will be fine. This is how children of wealthy parents play. This isn't play. They're digging their own graves. Life seems beautiful in my embrace I am a blossoming beauty Life seems beautiful in my embrace I am like a twinkling star I'll steal your heart away Even flowers appreciate my beauty Everyone sings my praises Life seems beautiful in my embrace My cheeks are rosy My gait, intoxicating My lips are like dewy petals I am love personified Life seems beautiful in my embrace The place where I live... is surrounded by my lovers When I adorn myself and step out... men drool at the sight of me Life seems beautiful in my embrace Gentlemen, an able student of ours... Mr. Javed will now present a speech. Respected President and gentlemen... I'd like to express my gratitude to the president for my introduction. Alas! My father died when I was a child. My mother, a poor widow... strived hard to send me to this school. I'm thankful to God for giving me such wonderful teachers. Thanks to them, we students can hold our heads up high. It's not formality... but I'd like to tell you the reason for my visit. - Am I right, Mr. Ashfaque? - Yes. Uncle, I've come here to tell you about the plight of orphans. They have no one. They go without food for days. They are malnourished. If they aren't helped, they'll die a horrible death. No amount of monetary help is enough for these children. How can people speak ill of you? They talk ill of a kind person like you. They make up stories about you. I'm just an ordinary man. The poet, Ghalib says... 'People mistake my kindness for selfishness'. 'My good intentions are termed bad'. I request you donate some money for those orphans. Sure. I'll bring it right away. I'll have some tea brought. Gafoor! Yes, sir? - Bring some tea. - All right. I've heard, he has a beautiful daughter. She is really beautiful. I haven't seen her yet. Please be seated. Please accept this donation for the orphans. - Thank you. - May God bless you! That was good. But we raised only Rs. 500. What about the rest? We promised the orphanage we'd raise Rs. 3000. There's our answer. - Greetings! - Yes? - I wanted to speak to you. - All right. Your father's thumb print is required on the documents. - I'll get that done. - Very good. - Greetings. - God bless you, dear. - Did you get a reply? - Yes. Please be seated. Why do you take the trouble? You should've sent for me. You do me a huge favor by writing letters and reading them. 'Dear mom...' 'received your letter'. - 'I'll be there in a few days. I have holidays' - And? 'Earlier, you used to ask Mr. Ali to write letters'. 'I wonder who it is now'. 'Whoever it is, please convey my regards to him'. 'Your son, Javed'. Listen. - May I learn to read and write? - Why not? Ali Rehmat learned to read and write at the age of 40. Please teach me to read and write so I don't have to bother you. Sure. I'll come to your house to teach you. This letter is from mom. And this one? Mr. Shaikh... Throw it in the trash. I know what dad must've written. He must've written... 'Son, get your clothes washed for 25 paise'... 'and ask them to give you credit'... 'as we're very poor'. Poor. Dear dad... received your letter. Things are so difficult here. I'd like to tell you what they are. Let me explain. I'm trying to produce gold. If I succeed, or if a rich girl agrees to marry me... I'll be freed of you. And so on and so forth. Convey my regards to the slim and trim stepmother. Yours sincerely... your dear son. I wonder who writes the letters for Mom. It seems to be an intelligent young woman. It's possible it's a young woman... but she could be writing them with her old father's pen. Mister, her style of writing reflects youth. You should start making preparations. Love seems to have struck you. We belong to Allah and to Him shall we be returned. Let's pray Javed has fallen in love. God, help him. And if he has to be sent to heaven... make sure there's no pretty maiden there. Mom, something happened today. You have to hear it. - What happened, son? - I got some money. No matter who comes before me, I can stand up to them. - What have you done? - I've gained knowledge. I can predict the future not only of humans but monsters too. Let me demonstrate it. Khushkadam! - Yes, sir? - Come here. You've worked for us for years. Don't lie to me. Show me your hand. Not like that. Like this. - A boy was born to you. - God! What are you saying? - I'm not even married yet. - Wrong. You're married and have borne a son too. Ma'am, please tell him something. - What is he saying? - I'm right. How can you say that? In your imagination... one day, you imagined... you were married... and then you gave birth to a bonny baby boy. Isn't that true? Yes, sir. I did imagine it. So, you imagined you got married... and bore a son as well. I agree this is a sin. - May God forgive me. - Remember one thing. The more you imagine all this, it will be as good... as having that many children and having married many times. God, I imagine it so many times. Son... you can see the unforeseen. It's a gift from God. By God's grace I'm going to be a mystic. A happy mystic. Son... I'd lied to your father yesterday. - Will I... - I was just about to tell you. You took the words out of my mouth. You shouldn't interfere in a mystic's work. The lines on your palm are very fine. I have to take your thumb print. I'll do that right away. Come with me. Now it's fine. I'll go and consult my master... and tell you the details. Don't worry. Fortune is shining upon you. What can I do to pacify you? I'm so upset that even if you get me the moon... I still won't be pacified. Someone might come here. - So what? - Now... - What happened? - I've pulled a muscle. Oh! Do you want me to massage it? No matter what you do, I won't relent. Is that so? Then I'll be upset too. Go ahead and do so and make sure you do. I'll shout and gather a crowd here. Do you think that scares me? I'm asking for what's mine. There's something you're hiding in a small box. Give it to me. I'll keep it safe in the cupboard. - You are so delicate. - Sir! - Sir! - My goodness! Someone is calling out to you. - Give me the jewelry. - I won't. May God protect them. - Greetings. - You! - Yes. - Greetings. Please be seated. So, please ask him to wait outside. Take this. All right. So, the documents will cost Rs 5000... - and you'll get only Rs 2500. - Agreed. - I hope it won't be a problem. - No. All right. - Is this your mother's thumb print? - Yes. - No problem. You should sign it too. - Sure. You don't need to write about your father. I'll write it. May God protect us. May God protect us all. This boy has got a thumb print. They don't know how difficult it is to earn money. But he's like that. Here. But there's one thing. You have to pay it back within 3 months. - I'll pay it before that. - All right. Thank you very much. I was in dire need of money. An important task of the orphanage has to be done. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Take your hat. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Orphanage? I know why he needs the money. It will be used for... Come to me, I'll fulfill all your desires Come to me, my beloved Come to me, I'll fulfill all your desires Both of us are young You hold a drink in the hand With eyes mesmerising... spend time with me Come to me, my beloved I'll fulfill all your desires I had no idea this path was difficult Love doesn't come easily The pockets are empty now All that is left is me having to curse you And I will do that, come to me Come here, my beloved You dwell in my heart, my lover I'll fulfill all your desires Come to me, my beloved I'll fulfill all your desires I swear... you were amazing today. You look different. The blush on the cheeks. Delicate earrings dangling from the ears. The graceful dance. Eyes reflect worry, tension on the face. Generations of men fall for you. Tell me, why did you come here late? Dear, it took me time to collect money for your orphanage. Don't say it like that. There's no doubt we're orphans. I agree but there are men who come here... and are only fit to be fathers and grandfathers. - Right, brother. - Don't call me that! I think you're as irresistible as my favourite sweet. Mister, I'm difficult to get. - You won't be able to afford me. - Don't worry about that. I've come prepared. Not just one or two, all of 3000. - Is that true? - Absolutely. This is what took me time. Why are you pinching her? You should praise me to the heavens. Bravo, master! Porter! It's done. All right. Tell me... who's the most foolish person in the world? The most foolish? The most foolish person... Sheikh Chilli. But let me tell you, Mr. Sheikh is an intelligent man. Intelligent people are also very foolish. All right. You told me that yesterday. I've written it all down. I'll show it to you. Mom! My dear mom! - You're here! How are you? - I'm fine. - Mom, what are you doing? - This... I'll tell you. Should I? I've learned to read and write. - These are my books. Look. - Congratulations, mom. Once you complete the basic education... I'll enroll you in Aligarh College. You won't need to. I'm sure my teacher is better... - than any professor in your college. - Is that so? Speak softly. She's inside. So what? I'm here, too. You've become very naughty. I'll beat you. Does education make you humorous? - Javed has become like that. - Mom... if I have your permission, may I pass by in a 'burka'? My eyes will stay closed. Aunt, tell him that going by things happening now... it's possible men will be in 'burkas' and women will wield swords. Amazing! What a scene it will be! A woman wielding a sword. A sword with a sword. Stop this sword talk. I'll punish you. You've become very naughty. Mom, it would've been nice if the slap... had come from someone else. Naughty boy! If you don't comply with my request... I'll buy a cannon instead of a gun. You'll buy a gun? Is that what you've been taught? I'll have to comb through a jungle to find some herbs. What? Listen, this boy will bankrupt me. - You make him understand. - Mom... if you side with him, I'll be upset with you. Worthless boy! How can you speak to your mother like that? Is there going to be a rebellion here? Dad, the world has moved ahead... but you stayed confined within these four walls. - What does he mean? - Who knows? Don't make me party to your crime. I have to answer to God. - Not just that, dad. - What else? God will ask you about your cupboard. He'll order the angels... - to bring your cupboard. - So what? It contains what He's given me. He didn't give it to you. You've cheated poor and helpless people. He brings us to this earth... and orders us to provide for ourselves and for others, too. Listen, he won't go back to college. Didn't I tell you it would spoil him? Son, if you speak to your father like that... - he'll leave home. - Not just home, but the world. - May God protect us... - From a moneylender! Goodness! My goodness! Wake up! Your teacher is here. Ever since your son came, you've stopped studying. I don't like it. Wake up and study else I'll... Oh no! Come back here Come into my heart Come back to me You give meaning to life Oh beautiful maiden... come back here Come into my heart Come back to me I am crazy about you You are like the spring You are my beloved You are my love I love your coyness... and your style Smile for me Come into my heart Come back here Ever since I first saw you... I've been crazy about you You've stolen my heart away Nothing else matters Everything seems meaningless... without you Make my dreams come true Come into my heart Come to me Thank you for informing me. But I'm sad that... without asking me, you gave Sajjad Rs 6000. - Sir... - You know what he does. Mr. Khan, this happened because of your wife. She put her thumb print on the document. When did I put my thumb print on any document? The paper... My son has ruined my life. My health is deteriorating. My heart is weak. That's what brought me here. When I heard you were ailing... I thought if you passed away... I'd be as good as dead. You fooled me into doing it? Don't interfere in my work. I used the money for good. I'm providing for some orphans. May God bless you. May you have a peaceful death. May you go to heaven. Amen. I'll pray for you. Yes, sir. Please pray... that I die soon. Sir, I forgot to ask you... how you were feeling. Greetings, Mr. Sheikh. Greetings, sir. Greetings. Masood is smelting gold. Do you think he'll succeed? May he succeed! I've thought of giving him a gun. - What do you say? - You must let him buy a gun. - He will succeed. - Really? He'll smelt a lot of gold. Your house will be full of gold. May that come true. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Will you let me die in peace? What are you getting so furious over? You've marred our reputation. I want to ask you, Sabira. What is wrong with you? Is that what you're supposed to do? You put your thumb print on documents... so he can take out loans! So he can go to brothels and bring disgrace upon us! People try to defame my son. If God wills, he'll improve after marriage. I won't let any girl suffer by getting her married... - to a worthless person like him. - Dad! God, why don't you take me away? The Quran was recited here once. Now, there's nothing but ruin. Mom, tell dad... I don't like being insulted in front of strangers. He's infuriating me. Ask him to keep quiet... or I'll say things... - that may prove fatal for him. - Sajjad! Aren't you ashamed to speak like that about your father? How dare you interfere in our family matters? - It'll be better if you leave. - Aunt? He's right. Who are you to interfere in our personal matters? You're right, aunt. If it was personal, I wouldn't have interfered. But what's happening is extremely wrong and shameful. How can you cite your opinion of what's right or wrong? What makes you think I can't do it? - Quiet! - When one can't answer... You cheap person! Sonofagun! - Rascal! - Dad! Sajjad! God, please take me. Let me die. I can't live to see Sajjad ruining himself. I don't want to live. Let me die. I don't want to live. Let me die. - Uncle! - Please, my dear! Sir, please go there. - Your father is dead. - So what if he is? He was suffering. - Javed... - After that? After that? - Write. - What should I write? I don't know. - Is it private? - Private? 'Javed, I want to ask you...' 'Javed, I want to ask you...' Write. I want to ask him about marriage. It's so hot today. - It's like a furnace. - Wait... God, it's at the tip of my tongue... but I can't express it in words. - The pen doesn't seem to work. - What? - It's not working. - It's not? Should I write that he should write back? - Yes and also write... - Oh no! - I wonder why I'm perspiring so much. - Perspiring? - I am feeling uneasy. - Uneasy? - I'll write the letter tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - I hope my wish is fulfilled. - May it be. He'll surely do well in the exams. I have another wish, dear. Who can be better than you? May God fulfill this wish of mine too. Javed, congratulations. - Congratulations. - Congratulations, Javed. Congratulations, Javed. I heard of your success. - And that you stood first... - First in the university. Goodbye. Congratulations. Congratulations. We've heard that... you've finally passed the BSc exams. Mr. Sheikh, we've come to congratulate you on your success. Stop teasing me and telling me that I've passed. I know, I've passed the BSc exams. So... so... so, why are you sad? I spent 9 years at this college. The hostel, the cook... I'm sad about leaving all this and going. I came here hoping I'd be here till I die. But, it seems I'll die in some hospital abroad. Greetings. Naaz! No, teacher. Greetings. Ma'am, I won't study today. I want an off. Why? There's no festival. I won't give you off. Ma'am, the son of this student of yours... has passed his exams and is coming home. I want to make some preparations. I see! So that's the reason. I'll help you with that. Tell me, what do you want me to do? I'll go upstairs and change the pillow covers. You bring some blankets and sheets from the trunk. - Go! - Sure. Mom! Angels, what just happened? Fairies were startled... shivers went down maidens' spines. Please forgive me. Who knew, you are present everywhere all the time. Angels, apologize to her on my behalf. I'm the sort of a man who believes in equality. The mistake I made might be made by another. If you allow me, I'll stand here with a blanket over me. If someone comes and embraces me... that will be my punishment. So? Why is someone standing shyly in the garden of paradise? Why is her forehead dotted with perspiration? I'd like to ask, why she's awake? I swear... her slender neck will tire of moving left and right. Ask her not to look around. Why has she hidden her beautiful face? Ask her to move her hands away. And in the rush she dropped her earring. Tell her, it must be stuck in the stole. Yes, it's right. There it is. Right there. In the stole. No. It's there. There it is, yes. - Javed. - Mom! - I'm happy... - Mom. That you passed your exams. In the mirror... I saw the reflection of a beautiful face The whole of the universe is crazy about it That's the face I saw The eyes are mesmerising The conversations radiate love The beauty that's reflected in the flowers... that's the face I saw... In the mirror... I saw the reflection of a beautiful face The stole flies in the breeze The style is amazing My heart calls out to you May your beauty never fade and may you prosper You give meaning to my life That's the face I saw... In the mirror... I saw the reflection of a beautiful face I thought of coming earlier... but something kept me from doing so. I hope you are all right. By God's grace I am. I hear about you from Naaz. It's good to have the elders' blessings. May my husband's soul rest in peace. He used to say, children should have the elders' blessings. You are someone in whose shadow... Javed will progress in life. I hope dad gives his consent. He doesn't need anyone to help him succeed. I request you... to please be kind enough to accept Javed and help him. Lady... it'll be kind of you to give me some time to think it over. Tell him I've come from Mr. Khan's house. I am Sajjad's mother. - Khushkadam, tell him. - Greetings. Greetings. Khushkadam, ask the maids to wait for me inside. I've come here for a special purpose. If God wills, it will be good for you too. How to say it? Many people expressed the desire... to have Sajjad marry their daughters. You'll understand. Something precious can't be reduced to dirt. Children of rich parents marry into rich families. What a coincidence! Your elder sister has also come to meet me in this regard. I don't have an elder sister. I don't maintain ties with lowly people. I consider it below my dignity to even mention their names. May I say something? - She's here right now. - Oh yes. It's possible she's come here with a proposal. But they don't even have enough money to buy poison. Asking for a rich girl's hand in marriage is no joke. You must know how Javed is. He's a liar, a cheat and a rascal. He's only had a basic education. I heard, he's looking for a job that pays only a meager salary. My sister has come to you with a marriage proposal... and only a single motive. That in her old age... she gets the support of a rich family. God forbid, if something happens to you... they stand to gain from it. That must be her motive. You share blood ties with her. What can I say? But you wouldn't want your daughter to suffer. What father would want that? Congratulations to you and to me. I know, you've consented to this alliance. I'll go and meet Naaz. I'll perform a ritual... to ward off the evil eye. Sister! Sabira, I'm thankful to you. You were right. We are lowly people. We're poor. Dear, don't feel ashamed. Donate this money to the poor. 'Do you agree to marry Sajjad, son of Mr. Khan'... 'for a 'mehr' of Rs 20,000?' 'Do you agree?' 'Do you agree?' - Dad! - Dear, Sajjad is your husband now. You belong to him. No matter what the circumstances... you have to be with him. Don't even complain about him to me. May you always be happy. What a creation of God! As delicate as a flower, as beautiful as an angel The bride is a real beauty What a creation of God! She is doe-eyed... with long, black tresses She's as delicate as a reed What a creation of God! She is so demure She is so lovely The lines on her forehead are like fairies' wands What a creation of God! Tell me... did you get married to me... or to these lovely ladies? Accept the greetings of your husband. Actually, you are my servant. But these ladies tell me otherwise. I don't follow rules and traditions. I am at your service and you... Though we stay in the same neighbourhood... this is the first time I've seen you. You're like the blue moon. You're even better than that... because seeing you is more rare.. You bring joy to some and others... Your life is made... while mine is ruined I beseech you... The one dwelling in the skies, I beseech you Your life is made... while mine is ruined All the flowers... in your garden are blooming The one you wanted... is yours now What lies in store for me... is sorrow and memories of you Your life is made... while mine is ruined You must be happy... that you have something to live for What I got in return for my love... was nothing but tears Don't worry about me This world is full of miracles Of the two of us... one is happy while the other is sad I beseech you... The one dwelling in the skies, I beseech you Your life is made Son, you're still awake? Too much happiness leads to sorrow. Everything comes with a price. What happened was for the good. I'll complete my education. I'll get a scholarship from college. I've decided, mom. Mom, tell dad... that I'll go abroad with Javed to complete my education. He's an infidel! He doesn't follow any traditions. He just shows off his education. If you don't allow me to go, I'll commit suicide. Did you hear that? He's threatening me. - Do you believe in Judgement Day? - Of course. My religion speaks of it. When God questions you about why you took interest... - what will you say? - Quiet! When you are asked how many people you helped... - and how many you cheated... - Stop it! You insolent brat! Your cheating people is justified... but if I go abroad I'm labelled a sinner! No way! I will go abroad. - You'll have to give me Rs 20,000. - 20,000? - Yes. 20,000. - 20,000. Dear wife... hold me, hold me. I'm having a heart attack. Read some prayers. Yes, mom. Do that... and jingle some money near his ears. He'll be absolutely fine. Listen, tell this worthless boy that... Mom, tell this worthless boy to go abroad. And I'll leave, bidding everyone goodbye. I'll go away. Ma'am, don't! You shouldn't lift heavy things. It may harm you. What might happen? You never know. Something may happen. What will happen? I know what will. - What do you say? - Bet Rs 2000. - What do you say? - Rs 2000. Well then, I bet Rs 4000. - Rs. 8000. - That won't do. - Why? - Put up the cash. - Don't you trust me? This is gambling. Done. Show me the cards. - If you lose... - I'll get the money. Should I? Here you are. Three aces. You know why you lost? She's unlucky for you. Shut up, flunkey! I'll rip your tongue out! - Water, sir. - Move! What's wrong? Why do you cry all the time? What do you intend to do? Bring misfortune? Mom, I just couldn't help crying. Great! You talk too much. Do you speak like that to your mother-in-law? I've never seen an insolent daughter-in-law like you. I wasn't complaining. I felt sad so... Why don't you say... you want to know why your husband went to the fair? Isn't that it? But sons of rich parents do all that. When one has wealth, one should enjoy life... not serve his wife. That's not the reason for my being upset. Mom! There! Your husband is here. Why are you upset now? Come with me. I need to discuss something urgent with you. See your wife first. She may misunderstand. She may think I'm encouraging you. Come with me. I don't have time. People are waiting for me. Mom, I've decided to set up a jewelry store with Nawab Rangeela. It's a profitable business. I need some capital. - Will you sell stones now, son? - Give me the property deed... and other important documents. I'll get a loan of 40,000 against them. Son, will you be able to identify the precious stones? What are you saying? Can't I identify precious stones? You're too much. Listen... - I doubt your intentions. - What? Give the documents back to mom. There's a knife there. Slit my throat and go over my dead body. You're not the boss here. You're just my wife. What happened? Mom, she always says something or other against you. Do you think I'll tolerate that? I can give up a thousand wives for you. Wretched woman! You want me to break ties with mom? For God's sake! Believe me, I didn't say that. I'm sure you did say it. I'm not deaf. I heard it myself. God is witness. I won't let you go. I won't. Oh, my! All I can say is... I hope you didn't hurt your hand. You wretch! Cursed woman! Get out! As you sow, so shall you reap. She wanted to throw me out! Ma'am! Khushkadam... please help me up and give me support. I might deliver any moment. I'll be subject... to more torture There will be more adversities People will harass me They will torment me I came into the world crying Crying I will leave But not one complaint... will I ever utter The flowers... are in full bloom I wonder what lies in store for me It feels like a storm of sadness Where have I come from? Where am I headed? I am so unfortunate I don't know if I'll be blessed I came into the world crying Crying I will leave But not one complaint... will I ever utter May God protect us. You'll empty my coffers. But tell me something. Have you brought that? Good. This is important. No formalities. You can come to me whenever you need me. Consider this house your own. Take this. And this. And more. And this. - Go on. - Rs 10,000. - 20,000. - Enough. - What are you doing? Pick up a card. - Go ahead. I bet 20,000. - Make it 40,000. - Enough. Show. - All right, show. - Sure. Nine, ten, Joker. Same color. Ma'am, it's a boy. Sir, congratulations. It's a boy. Thank you, God. - Sir, it's a boy. - Thanks be to God. It's a boy! It's a boy! - It's a boy! - How big is he? Very big. No. He's this big. No, this big, no, he's so tiny. He's so fair, like the moon. Congratulations, son. It's a boy. I want peace right now. Ask everyone to stop celebrating. Stop the music. Stop everything! God has blessed you with a beautiful son. He's exactly like you. He has sharp features. I don't want him. I don't want a son who's brought me bad luck. He's unlucky. Throw him out... so that stray dogs can eat him up. - God! - Don't say that! God is... Where's the jewelry? Give me the keys. The jewelry is in the trunk. Look at your son at least. He is so beautiful. You haven't done anything great. Give me the keys. And bury him alive, if possible. Now look, save your tears for your father's funeral. You bring bad luck. You should've spared me today at least. How much will you torture me? Is that what you've been taught? To complain about your husband? What a woman! I'm happy that you spoke to me at least. You at least looked at me, even if with hatred. Are you even worthy of my love? You should be thankful... that I even hate a cursed woman like you. I'm among those who reject even beautiful maidens. I don't care about them. If you would only tell me what I've done... what I did wrong? I would repent for it. I would grovel at your feet and apologise. I would have kicked you if you had. Give me the keys. What is this money for? Dad sent Rs 5000 for the baby. Tell your father to send this money to some poor man's house. When I was born my grandfather gave me... Rs 20,000 and 11 sets of clothes on a golden tray. Hear that? Your grandfather was blessed with a lot of wealth. His grandfather is a poor Muslim. If that's so, why is he alive? Ask him to kill himself. Come here. May Allah watch over you Your mother dotes on you Don't cry, my son The broken toy... will be fixed Nothing is more precious than you are Not silver nor gold There's only one thing that matters... and it's difficult to get Should I tell you what it is? No matter how bad the world or what the difficulties... seek refuge in your own heart It's the heart that gets you through And it says... once broken it doesn't mend It is delicate It is like a flower... that gives us fragrance May Allah watch over you Your mother dotes on you May Allah watch over you Don't break this mirror Don't open this wound Once broken, it never mends The sadness in one's heart... will destroy the world The heart symbolises love It makes the world go round Allah loves one and all May Allah watch over you Your mother dotes on you May Allah watch over you Greetings. My son has come from abroad. I'll meet you later. - Greetings. - Where is Masood? He's there. In the next compartment. - Has he got his degree? - Yes, and something else too... - along with his degree. - Get porters for him. Porter! Porter! Daddy! Stop joking! I'm looking for my son. I'm your son. Don't you recognise me? I'm looking for my son, Masood. Look carefully. I'm your son, Masood. You look so different. - Where's the degree? - It's inside. Is it heavy? Should I call some porters for help? - Porters, come with me. - Porter! Where is it? Come quickly! - Hey porter! What are you doing? - Who are you calling a porter? - Be polite. - Shut up! - I won't put it up. Behave yourself. - Shut up! Quiet! Look at this lady. - She is my wife. - Times are bad! - Listen to me, I say! - Times have changed. - She's my wife. - Rubbish. - She's my wife. - Wife? Masood, this is your wife? Goodness gracious! Good God! How could you? Mom! Mom! Javed! My son! You're back! - I can't believe it! - Mom, I'm back, and for good. I prayed so hard. And God has answered my prayers... and has brought you back safe and sound. Mom, wipe your tears. Why do you need to cry? No crying anymore. Lord, why did you have to send this foreigner to my house? Was there no other house in this city? Lord Almighty, rid us of all evil. Lord Almighty, rid us of all evil. - Greetings, dad. - Greetings. Are you going to parade this foreigner all around town? Dad, I've brought chocolate for you. Chocolate? Goodness gracious! They've taken away all our wealth, Now they're attacking our culture too. Now, will you teach her how to behave here? She'll learn gradually, dad. I don't care how you speak or what you do... but since you're my daughter-in-law... you'll have to be in 'purdah'. No, dad. I don't like wearing a 'burka'. Goodness gracious! Is she raving? She says she can't do it. I say, she must! Masood! Cover her legs, will you? Hurry up! Cover them. Don't come here! She's naked. - Good God! Why don't you close your eyes? - Yes. - Let's get out of here. - Wait, dad. - Note down these things. - What? A new bungalow, a new car... two butlers, modern furniture... and ultra modern things. My wife and I will stay there. God, I am feeling ill. I think I'm going to die. Sir, you've won the case for me. I am so grateful to you. I'm a poor man. Here's Rs 30. I can't pay you more than this. Uncle, keep the money. You've given me my fees already. What? I haven't given you a single penny. You've added it to my account that is with God. You help the poor. May God shower his mercy on you. - May you live a billion years. - No. Don't pray for that. After my dear ones are dead and gone... what will I do alone in this world? Goodbye, uncle. Your Honor, man makes laws and changes them too. The law can be used to one's advantage. My client is poor and illiterate. Taking advantage of his illiteracy... the accused tried to cheat him of the goods. I request the court to mete out justice. Mr. Javed, do you doubt the court's decision? I only believe in divine justice. Greetings. - Greetings, Mr. Lawyer. - Hello, Mr. Rangeela. - Please be seated. - Thank you. You must've gone through the papers. I know, you're related to Sajjad. He cheated me into giving him the jewelry... saying he'd buy it if his wife liked it. It was a lie. He sold the jewelry and lost the money gambling. The one who bought it is ready to testify. Let me tell you, Mr. Rangeela, that I can't help you. Ask another lawyer to fight your case. I came here thinking that you consider him your enemy. He's harmed you in many ways. I thought this would give you a chance to get your revenge. Mr. Rangeela, you're mistaken. Sajjad didn't wrong me in any way. He's my cousin. May God guide him to the right path. Whatever. I'll make sure I have Sajjad sent to jail. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. This is so bad. Sir, for how long will you pay his bail? So, Ms. Hafizun, you have to get Rs 2000? Yes, sir. I'd left it with Mr, Sheikh for safekeeping. He refuses now. God knows what he has against poor widows. Sir, it was our life savings. No one knows what we're going through. You should've asked him to give you a receipt. We didn't know he'd do something like that. God will bless you... if you help us get our money back. We'll die of starvation. We don't have a single penny left. Please don't worry. I'll get your money back. - Good evening, sister. - No, no, no. Say, 'Greetings sister-in-law.' That's great. Greetings sister-in-law. - How are you? - Fine, by the grace of Allah. It's Javed! Greetings. Greetings, doctor. How are you? - I'm fine. Please be seated. - After you, sister-in-law. Thank you. - I've come to discuss something. - Go ahead. Someone has filed a case against your father. - Two widows. - I know about that. Dad refuses to give the widows their money. - You may mind my fighting their case. - Not at all. Please fight the case. If I were a lawyer, I'd fight this case. - May God give dad better sense. - Praise be to God. I thought you'd be upset with me. But I'm impressed by your thoughts. Great! Did you think I lost my mind after marriage? I'm sorry, but I'm still sane. - Great! Goodness Gracious! - Goodness! I have urgent work. Ma'am has instructed me not to allow anyone inside. I'm not anyone. I'm your master's father and your mistress' father-in-law. - You're ma'am's father-in-law? - Not ma'am's, but sir's. Why are you laughing? You aren't wearing a coat or tie. No way! You can't be his father. Ass! If I'm not his father, am I yours? Such cheap shoes and old pyjamas. How dare you say that about my pyjamas! You won't listen. I'll have to force my way in. Let me go, you rascal! Masood, your father is here. Time to leave. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - You're raising wild animals, son! - Greetings. Greetings. What was our enemy doing here? He's fighting a case against me. I've come to tell you that. I'm happy he's doing that. You cheated those two widows. You should know how to talk to your father. We aren't allowed to take interest or harass helpless people. I don't take interest. I only take some profit. This kind of profit is a sin for a Muslim. Listen, ma'am... please reason with your husband. Else I'll take away this bungalow... this easy chair and everything here. I don't want your money. My husband can earn. I don't sympathize with you. Go away. Go away? She asked me to go away? This place is strange. But I say... You're here as well? Goodness gracious! Goodness gracious! Hello, mom. Javed, you're late. Mom, I've paid Mr. Haji. He'll start building our new house in a few days. Mom! I have to pay Rs 20,000. - We'll have to sell this house. - What? Mom, our new house will be... one of a kind. If we sell the house, where will we live? - On the streets? - I don't like arguments. Give me the property deed. The house will be sold within 2 days. Our new house will be ready in a few months. My darling son... you've become so successful. You've made us bankrupt. I had no idea I'd see the day... when we'd be on the streets. - I won't let you sell the house. - Mom! I won't give you the deed. I won't give it to you. Mom! Look at this. The blueprint of our new house. Such a big house! I don't believe this! How could you slap me? - For the last time, give me the deed. - I won't! - I won't give it to you. - I'll set the house on fire! - I won't give it! - I'll kill you! - I won't give it to you! - I'll make sure you give it. Do what you want! I won't give you the deed. - Move out of the way. - For God's sake, fear Allah! Move! Son... you should get married now. I'll look for a girl for you. No, mom. What has anyone gained by getting married? Repeat, 'I, Sheikh Azizullah, son of Habibullah'... 'swear that I'll speak the truth.' Sir, you can't force me to do this. I'll tell you everything without swearing. - I'm an honest man. - This is court protocol. Goodness gracious! May God protect us! Think that I have sworn. I, Azizullah, son of Habibullah... will tell the truth when needed. So, Mr Azizullah... answer my questions. I don't want to talk to this man. He's from my neighbourhood and he's fighting a case against me. That's not fair. And he's my son's friend. Sir, ask this man to leave or I'm leaving. Order, order! You'll have to answer his questions. Do you know these two widows? I don't know them, neither do I know you. So, on the 10th of Shabaan... Why would these 2 widows come to my house... on the 10th of Shabaan? I'm not a beggar. And, and I was ill that day. - What was the ailment? - Ailment? Are you a doctor to ask me about my ailment? I'd strained a muscle. - Didn't they give you Rs 5000? - Yes, they did. No! Your Honor, you should've made him swear as well. He's a liar! He said it was Rs 5000 when it was only Rs 2000. - They gave you Rs 2000, right? - Yes, they did. So what? - Your Honor, he has admitted... - But... that he was given Rs 2000 by the widows. No more questions. Sir, he deceived me. This isn't fair. He lied to get the truth out. That's not fair. Order, order! You have two days to return the Rs 2000 to these widows. That's the court's order. Your Honor, listen to me... Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Goodness gracious! How rude! All of you are busy eating. No one is greeting me in return. Have you gone deaf? I greeted all of you. Goodness gracious! Listen, I am furious right now. I'm really angry. Understand? Masood, tell your father I don't want to talk to him. But, you've been upset long enough. Let's go home. Tell him, I won't go there. - You trouble your wife a lot. - Keep quiet! You stepped into the house and created a rift between us. Masood, ask this woman to keep quiet. Ma'am... he hasn't come home. - Why is he like that? - No, Khushkadam. He is a good man. He hasn't ever spoken to you nicely. He's been away for 15 days. It must be so difficult. What is life... without difficulties? What use are the eyes... if they don't well up? Ma'am, he's here. Naaz... let me speak to you for the last time. About a broken heart. About how unfortunate I am. I'm going away. Please don't say that. - Please don't. - I know... that your heart is very delicate. - What is it? - It's okay. After all the heart is a delicate thing. My heart is filled with sorrow. If anyone hears about it... even a stone-hearted person will melt. You'll get tired standing. Sit down. - I'll massage your feet. - No. I feel like kissing your feet for the last time. You're such a good wife... that even angels praise you. God! Why are you saying that? How do I tell you I have to pay Mr. Rangeela, Rs 20,000? If I don't pay it back today... I'll be sent to jail. I'm the last of my family. Our reputation will be tarnished. It's better that I kill myself. I'll ask dad for money if you allow me to. It's not right to trouble him every time. I was trying to avoid this. I know, you're so kind-hearted... that you'd ask your father to help. But the problem is, I can't even stop you... because if I don't pay back the money today... I'll kill myself and then, what will happen to you... and our child? I hope I don't go to jail. Son, I hope your mother doesn't become a widow. Please don't say that! Don't feel bad for a criminal. It doesn't matter if I'm alive or not. I'll go to dad right away and ask him for the money. Naaz... if you don't get the money, don't come back here. If you don't get it, I'll have to commit suicide. And you won't be able to see that. I don't have any money. Understand? I've willed the money I had, to my grandson. Because I know, you and your son... will have to starve because of your husband. - I've saved it for that day. - Dad... if he dies, why should we live? Naaz, he won't change. If you help him today, he'll do it again tomorrow. Just a few days ago... I paid a bail of Rs 5000 for him. Dad, he has improved now. He sounded sad. Women are foolish to believe a man's smooth talk. And he fooled me as well. He said he came to collect money for the orphanage. He pretended to be so kind and god-fearing. What pretense! What craftiness! Dad! You are unfortunate, Naaz. I got you married to him. You couldn't have fought destiny. Objecting to God's will... isn't something we should do. Alas! You didn't tell me. But I found out anyway. He tortured you. He made you cry. He even raised his hand on you. You don't remember... but you told me... that I shouldn't complain about my husband. Besides, the truth is... whatever he is, he's still my husband. He'll drink poison, he'll kill himself! Please save him one last time! Please help him! - If God wills that he should die, let him! - Dad! Will you able to see me in widow's garb? For me, your husband is as good as dead. You're a widow and he's dead. Dad! I came to ask you for money. - Please don't curse him! - Only curses for him from this house! I only hear one voice... - and it says, it's better you're a widow. - Dad! I can bear that, but I can't see you suffer. I pray that he dies. God, please let him die. Dad! Dad! God! It seems that your dad refused to give the money. Sell me off and pay off the debt. Answer me! - What reason did he give for refusing? - Reason? God knows I tried really hard. But dad told me he has willed everything to our son. - And that he has no money left. - Nothing? No money? He willed it all to our son! That means, I'll have to go to jail. Tell me. Answer me. I don't accept this! He's cheated me! How can he will everything to our son? How dare he! Mom. Mom. This cursed boy has brought me bad luck ever since he was born... and he's standing before me like a barrier. He's responsible for this. From the time he was born, I've been losing money. I won't let him live. I'll kill him. - Right now. - No! - Leave me. - No! - I'll kill him! - No! - My son! Please help! - Let me go. My child! Please save him! - Please help! - Move! I won't spare you, you cursed... Help! Someone help! He's dead? He's dead! My son is dead! Sajjad is dead! Run! Run! Run! Run! Sajjad's corpse is lying in that room. There's blood all over. Go! Make sure the killer doesn't escape. Ma'am, you'll have to come to the police station with us. You have murdered your husband. Javed, I don't believe... Naaz killed her husband. Please save her. I don't believe it either. It might be true. But I can't do anything now. I wonder what God wills... - but I'll try my best. - Javed... I hope you don't nurse any hatred against us. I was swayed. I became blind to facts. Please don't think that. I have no grudge against you or anyone else. God knows that. Come on. You have permission to see your son. But you can't speak to him. Mom! Mom! What do I have to live for? There is sorrow all around Nothing can hurt anymore Everything is over Silence should engulf... the world I don't know if I'll live... to see another dawn The day you dreaded... has finally arrived It is the day... that has become a lifetime There's nothing but sorrow This is the beginning of Life This is the end of Life Everything is an illusion It all comes to an end Life is nothing Life is nothing... but a drama... and then the curtain falls There's nothing but sorrow Life is full of sorrow There is sorrow all around Nothing can hurt anymore... now that my life is ruined Mom! Do you want to say something? God is witness... that I didn't kill my husband. If you didn't kill your husband, who did? I can only tell you... that I didn't kill my husband. Can you tell me, at the time of the murder... who was present in that part of the house besides you? It's important for the jury to know that. He was there, I was there... and our son was there. I can't tell you who else was there. In my opinion, an important testimony is still pending. Sajjad's mother has lost her senses due to the trauma. She's lost her mental balance because of her son's death. In these circumstances, I order the deceased's son... to be produced as a witness. You look dejected. It seems, you won't be able to save Naaz. I can't say anything until after the child's testimony. - He might save his mother. - How will he do that? Have faith in God. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Son, what's your name? - Riyaz. - Will you tell us what we ask you to? - Yes. - Will you tell the truth? - Yes. Mom says, it's a sin to tell lies. Mr. Javed, you may ask the child some questions. Your Honor, this child is too young. I'm sure he won't be able to say anything clearly. We'll know that only when he starts telling us. How can we assume he won't be able to tell us? Children aren't sensible. Sometimes, they're more sensible than adults. Kid, listen. You're very sweet. You're a good boy. Do you know me? - Do you know who I am? - Uncle. That's right. Can you tell me how you got those marks on your neck? - I want to go to mom. - Who hit you? I want to go to mom. I want to go to mom. I want to go to mom. - I want to go to mom. - Tell me. Who hit your father with this iron rod? You can't go to your mom till you tell me. I won't allow you to be with her. I'll strangle you to death. Mom! Don't hit him! Or, I'll kill you! Mom. If you touch him, I'll kill you! I killed Sajjad. I'll kill you too. As long as I'm around, no one can harm him! No one can kill him. I'll kill anyone who lays a finger on him. He wanted to kill him, I killed him! Grandma! Grandma, what happened? Mrs. Khan Bahadur killed Sajjad. She should've been tried in this case. But she died while confessing to the crime. The court acquits Naaz. Please accept my congratulations... on finding a new lease on life. If in grief one finds a new lease on life... I must thank you. I'll try to live with this sorrow. No one in the world is happy. Everyone is sad. Every heart is broken. Life is nothing... but full of past memories. What was destined, has happened. But you don't have to spend your life thinking of the past. You are so young. I'd suggest that you get married again. I like Javed a lot. Dad... I'll do something else in life. Please come. Dr. Masood's wife is in a burka. Welcome. - So, it's you? - Yes. - Who invited you? - I don't need an invitation. I invited myself. The people of the neighbourhood don't want you here. But I want to see them. I've stopped taking profit. Why are they upset now? I asked forgiveness from God, and He forgave me. Then why are you being rude? I'm not a traitor that you should shun me. You shouldn't boycott me. Again I am asking you all for forgiveness with God as witness. I won't take any profit from anyone. Not from anyone! Today's function is to celebrate the opening of a school. Ms. Sajjad has donated her house to convert it into a school. - We are thankful to her. - May God protect us. Let me pass. May God protect us. You carry on. Greetings. She's taken on another responsibility. She'll teach the kids herself She'll be the principal of the school. I'll request that Ms. Sajjad say a few words. Folks, I'd like to address the women. A mother's embrace is the first school for a child. If a child isn't given the right upbringing... he causes problems for himself and others. It's every mother's duty... to inculcate the thirst of learning in her child. An illiterate person is a burden to the world. Our children, our illiterate children... roam around on the streets... and wander aimlessly. If our children aren't set on the right path, we'll never progress. We'll be wiped out. I don't need to say anything else. I'll sing an anthem. Please join me. We are indebted to humanity The Quran is recited in every nation If we remain illiterate, the fear is... that we'll be ruined some day Unemployment and illiteracy Education should be our religion This is our declaration We are indebted to humanity The Quran is recited in every nation
