TBC Filmproduktion presents Chapter One: The Count and his heirs Northern Franconia, 15th century This is the tale of Count Montrak. Once, he was a warrior of God. But soon Montrak's heart should fill with hatred. Turning his back on church, he made a pact with the devil. With an enchanted ring from Lucifer he became immortal. But this came with a price: Montrak was eternally cursed and became a slave of darkness. And so he isolated himself in the depth of his castle, fearing and loathing daylight. But the count shouldn't stay in his crypt by himself for long. Around 1430 the Hussites invaded Franconia. They destroyed and despoiled houses, farmyards and castles. So it happened that the invaders discovered Montrak's hideout, but also their end. The warriors entered the dark crypt with Wladislaw as their commander, whose destiny should change soon. Driven by inconceivable blood thirst, Montrak created his first entourage in the following nights. But quickly it became known who Montrak really was. The people wanted to see him dead. Montrak only saw one way to bury the myth of vampires: Through his own death. My fellows, time has come! 1 can feel my erstwhile warriors coming down to destroy us. They will kill us! We are not enough to withstand. But Lord, you are invincible! Only with the power of the ring! But my mission is completed. Now it is on you to complete Lucifer's plan. Take my ring. Then I will be your inheritor. You cannot be a master, you are already on the dark side. Only a human can be your new leader, whose soul is pure and free of all evil. To triumph over God, you will have to take one of his creatures from him. Choose a human who is close to hatred, use him, so he will turn to the dark side. If he is angered, he will activate the ring again and enable the reincarnation of my inheritor. Yes, my Lord. Now take the ring and follow my instructions. But Lord, I can protect you from the knights. No! This is Lucifer's plan. With my death, the humans will forget our myth. We will go down in this grave, but you have to survive. Nobody will hunt you anymore. Create an army. And in the far future you will go to war with your new master. My Lord, I'll have your words written down and everybody will follow them, anytime! Conquer God and his creatures. Now go! Before it is too late! Attack!!! Kill them!!! Ah... Wladislaw! Chapter Two: The Peasant 25 years later The bailiff is here, hurry up, it's getting dark! The harvest will be poor this year. It's God's will! God's will, that we go hungry? Have faith, times will get better. Father told me that a lot of work is waiting for us. Good that he talks to you at least. We have to leave tomorrow night. They are sending us far away. Before we leave, everybody should meet in the tavern. We haven't been able to celebrate anything for so long. Oh. Hey! Listen to me, lovely people! Today is an important day for me. I have to announce something. If you care, lift your jug and drink on me! On me and my future wife Elisabeth! Give me your blessings and I'll be the happiest man in the world. Wilhelm, on your well-being and our folk! We survived the attack of the Hussites. Only a clever and diligent man like you can strengthen our village. Diligent? He should work on the field instead of enjoying wine, wife and chanting during daytime. You heard what Gottfried said. We have some hard days ahead of us. We have to till the fields. Come on, let's go, SO we can set up our camp before the break of dawn. Don't worry, beautiful Elisabeth. Your father doesn't mean it that way. You are right, Karl. He doesn't want to realize that I'll be left in the hands of somebody else. Father never liked Wilhelm. When you are on the fields tomorrow, I will talk to Gottfried. You have my blessings anyway. Thank you, Karl. What would I be without you? And bring back your husband soon and healthy. He owes me! He miserably lost against me in the drinking game. You can depend on me. Get some rest! Kill the weak and bring me the strongest! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! We are being attacked! Run! They're burning everything! Run! Please don't go! Don't leave me here by myself! Run! Run! Wilhelm! Wilhelm! Grab the weapons! Defend yourself! Wilhelm! Go, run to the village! Grab him! Listen to me! We are the heirs of the Lord... Wilhelm was chosen by Wladislaw, because in the battle he was closest to anger. He was ordered to bring the ring to the people. Destiny would choose the new holder. Wladislaw promised Wilhelm freedom and wealth, even immortality, if he accomplishes his mission. Otherwise Wladislaw's army will destroy his village for good. He has a pact with the devil! Stone him! Yes, stone him, stone him, stone him! You were kidnapped by the beasts! Now speak! What have they done to you? Let me talk to Karl! Karl has no time for you. And my Elisabeth doesn't exist for you anymore. Gottfried, leave me! We have to leave this place! Ahhhhh. Let us go! Ahhhh... They will come back for us... Ahhhh. You come back after four days and dare to lie to us? You want to set a trap! Yes, he was turned into a demon! Continue! Stone him! Pssst, be quiet! Elisabeth is coming. Wilhelm couldn't believe what they've done to him. When he looked back on his village one last time, Wladislaw appeared. Let your hate guide you! The humans want your death! Come on, stone him! Through his wrath, Wilhelm activated the evil ring. But he didn't realize what the ring could do. Forget the people! Put on the ring and be a rich man! A stranger is approaching our camp, be ready! Jeronimus come on out! A stranger is approaching us. Let's see what is going on. You must be hungry after all the exertions. Where are you going? What are you looking for? Honestly? I don't know. What are you hiding from? You probably heard about the beasts? What do you know about them? My boy, if 1 knew anything, 1 would tell you! Nobody knows anything about them. They're scared of the daylight. We should unite and fight them, but the people are in great fear. Go to sleep now. Early in the morning you have to be gone. Otherwise my fellows are going to be suspicious. Jeronimus, thank you. Do you have any provisions 1 can take on my way? Haha, yes 1 do, but you will have to pay for it. 1 don't believe you have any valuables with you, hahaha. I'm afraid not. Well, then you have to look for a tavern that welcomes you. Hahaha... Wilhelm! You failed! I warned you. Now the punishment is yours! It's up to you. Put on the ring or you will die like your wife. Goodbye! In this painful and sad night, Wilhelm decided to fight Wladislaw and his army. Just like 1 predicted, he soon found a tavern. Hey! Cheers, cheers! May I sit down? Good evening! My name is... 1 don't care who you are. 1 suppose you're not interested Yo sit with a thief. Look for another table. I see. A thief? Then you are a wanted man. Possibly. But if you want my head, you are out of your mind. So, leave! Listen to me! Even if you don't believe my story, but I am looking for men like you. We must make a pact, because only then we have a chance to survive. More and more beasts are crossing the land, my entire village was... Listen to me carefully. Put all your valuables on the table or I will kill you like a rat. I don't have anything. Put all your valuables on the table, now! Chapter Three: The bloody night Now Missed Missed Greetings from Bayreuth Good Morning! Morning, Frank! Coffee? Yes! What are your plans for today? Can you pass me the cereal? What plans? Didn't you want to apply at this cleaning company? Yeah. I will. 1 still have three applications out, so something will come in somehow. Mom, 1 am taking care of my stuff. Trust me! Frank, I don't mind you living here. Nobody could know that they had to fire you in Hamburg. But I can't stand that you are sleeping in so long every day. Well, I am really looking forward to start working at "Hohenmdtller" in the fall. Nice colleagues, great work times, a very sexy secretary and a lot of cash. Good for you. Yeah, fuck you too! Hello? See mom? He gives me shit! Could you please stop this childishness? How old are you? How about you tell me what your plans are for tonight? Well, I will go to the club with Julia. Yeah, go twerking with dumb-ass! Still better than being married to Youporn! Hey, if you don't stop, you can forget about the car for your 18th birthday. Yes! Oh by the way... I have a date today. An important one with Tanja. Damn, she is hot. Can I borrow your car? Why? You haven't taken your car to the service station yet? Oh my gosh, unbelievable. It's your own fault! Mom, please! You mean Tanja Schuberth, don't you? Yes, I do! Yeah, in your dreams. You don't have any chance with her. Shut up! Let me guess, your psycho friend is coming too? Yes, maybe. Well, then you already have a car. Then you can pick up your brother from the club. And you, Heiko, will be at the entrance at midnight. Understood? Mom, come on, you can't ask me to do this. Do you know how embarrassing this is? Yeah, okay. See? You know, dude. 1 think it's destiny, man. All the way to your place 1 thought of her. And then: Boom! There she is, passing by. Just like that. You know, I look at her and think: Wow, what a woman! But do you know the best thing about it? She will be at Tech Noir tonight. That means I have to go there, man! The problem is, that 1 need to make a move. You Know. I have to say something cool. I have to do something. Or just simply come around with a drink in my hand and say: Hey, baby. But I have no idea. That's why 1 need a good plan, man. You need to help me. I need an awesome plan so she won't turn me down. You know? Boy, first of all you smell like shit. What? You smell like shit. Second, I will hop on my horse and leave town. For good. Once again. This time for real. Dude, let's talk about this tonight. I have to take care of something. Alright, I don't mind! Man, can 1 borrow your car tonight? You again forgot to take your car to the service station, huh? Fuck you! You sound like my mother. Shall I tell you something? You are smoking your cigarette the wrong way, you idiot! Fuck you, dude! Well... Still looks better than your mother taking you there. On second thought... Bro! Yes or no? Yeah, but... 1 am coming with you if you want to borrow my car. Boom! You're going to pick me up, okay? 10 p.m., alright? Yes. Then we will talk about everything and about your problems, bro. Howdy! Do I know this Tanja? 1 don't know, maybe you've already seen her somewhere. 1 think she was with this guy whom you've been in trouble with. A guy I was in trouble with? Boy, do you know how many guys 1 had trouble with? 1 had trouble with SO many people that I don't even know whom 1 didn't have any trouble with. 1 can't remember his name right now, but 1 think you were in the same class. Well, anyway. Tanja is single again now. But we are not talking about Jens Krause right now, aren't we? Oh yes, exactly. Jens! Oh, okay! Wasn't he the guy who chained you to the heater? By, boy. That's an old story, man. After that thing in the classroom, I challenged him to a duel. Eye to eye. Jens had no chance. My revenge was relentless. Well, then, you won't have any problems when the guy is in there, right? No, not at all. But I think, ehm... I'll stay outside. You know, this dude is probably setting a trap for me and 1 am not down for that at all. I am only into one on one. Alright, then 1 will go by myself. 1 would think twice, if 1 were you. This woman can be very dangerous. I don't care. Hi! I saw you at the park today. Really? Well, you've caught my attention for a while now and 1 wanted to ask you if 1 can buy you a drink? Ehm... Ey, are you out of your mind? Why are you hitting on my girl? Give him the chance to introduce himself. At least he is brave. Sorry, 1 didn't know, that you are still together. What? Everyone knows we are together, man. So piss off, you jerk! I am so sorry. Okay, no problem. 1 am gone. Hey, wait a minute. Wait, wait! Come here! What's your name again? Frank. Okay, Franky Boy, I have a surprise for you. Damn, you're in big trouble now. That was a huge mistake! Yeah, do you know why? My friend is outside waiting for you. He will bust your ass. And you know what? This belongs to you! Tanja, it was nice meeting you. Sorry. Beer? Fuck! This dumb-ass. He spit on me in front of everybody. What? Yeah, but never mind. I fired back - straight in his face. And the girl? Still hot? Forget this bitch. 1 don't care. I just want to go home. Alright, then we will have a drink at another saloon. No, man I just want to go sleep. Are you for real? Yes, come on! Let's ride. Listen to me! 1 warned you because of this shit, but you didn't want to listen. Am I right? '1 want to know if 1 am right? '? Yes! Okay, that means 1 tried to help you again. Who borrowed you the car? You! Okay, fine! When was the last time you have done me a favor? Boy, 1 really wanted to talk to you about this thing. About what thing? That you want to run away? For two years you've been telling me that. I am almost gone, man. You're really going to do it? Hey, dumb-ass? Your faggot friend is scared, huh? And? Did you bring Heiko? No, 1 am very tired and will go to sleep now. Are you crazy? Do you know what time it is? Mom, he is old enough. He will get back home. Frank, it is 1 a.m., your brother is 17. 1 trusted you with this. Probably he's sleeping at his girlfriend's. No! - Calm down. She canceled the date. He's out alone. Okay, 1 am sorry. 1 didn't mean to, okay. Frank, it's enough! You are so unlucky at the moment - okay. I am here for you. But if you don't understand that there are also other people besides you, then 1 can't help you any further. 1 know, mom, you are so right, okay. But I just had a very bad day. 1 also have to face SO many things. And now it's enough! The best thing would be you're looking for your own place. I mean that! Mom, oh come on. Okay, did he tell you that he wanted to stop by at a friend's house? No. Can you imagine now, why 1 am so scared? Oh God, oh my God. The newspaper is full of stories with all these wolves and missing people. Oh come on, mom. Don't take that too seriously. Nobody would go out anymore. Probably he's upon the hill with his friends, partying. He is alright, 1 am sure. Don't worry about it! Then go and look for him. I beg you. Call me when you've found him, alright? Immediately! Ok! Otherwise I'll call the police. I will go now and look for him, okay? I'l find him. Oh my goodness. The person you are calling is temporarily not available. You've probably heard already, creepy monsters are striking terror in the northern Bavarian region. Fact is, more people are disappearing without a trace. Are wolves really behind this or are there really monsters? More in the news soon. Sorry, did you see this guy today? Did he buy a six pack here? No clue! Shit, where the hell is he? Come on, Mario, let's go! Mario? Oh, phone! Yes? Hey brother! 1 am at home, so don't stress out! Damn, are you crazy? Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere. We've been celebrating and we're still celebrating. Cheers! Hey... Dumbass! What's wrong? Oh, shit! Is it Halloween today? Come on, let's go! Drive faster, drive... Yes, yes... Drive faster. Shit, shit. They're coming. Shit, what's that? Shit! Shit. Shit. Shit. Mario! Shit. Mario! Come on, jump in! Shit! Shit! 1 saw you today, you were at the gas station. You are? Nicki. Nice to meet you. Shit! You belong to them, right? You are one of them. Well, basically, yes. Okay. Stop! Stop! Let me out! Stop the car! If you leave, they'll kill you. If you're lucky, they will make you one of them. What? Well, maybe it's bad luck. Depending on the way you see it. Shit! 1 can't believe this. 1 am sorry, but it is the truth. What about your wound? Did you get bitten? No! Let me go! Stop the car and let me go! I want to help you, okay! If you want to survive, you need to trust me. Okay, stop here for a second, 1 feel sick. Please, stop. Okay. 1 have to get out! 1 feel sick. Hey! Wait, I want to help you. Hey, are you okay? Your wound really doesn't look good. Fuck the wound! Stay far away from me, stay away and leave me alone! No, don't be afraid! I'm not into human blood. And if ever I want some, we have our own blood bank. Well, that's assuring. You are totally crazy! Your fucking people killed my best friend! And 1 saved you from them! Would you rather be dead, too? Nobody ever saved me from them! Dude, they have a hold on me, as well! It is too much for me right now. It is for most humans. But it is the truth. We've been living among you, for centuries. In the late middle ages there was Montrak. He was a kind count, a good man. He lived and fought for God. Montrak had a wife he loved above all else. His countess Sofia was his greatest treasure. But she got sick. My dearest! Don't sin! Montrak was so convinced that Lucifer helps him to save his beloved from death. So, he asked him to make an immortality ring. Montrak put the ring on his countess' finger. But nothing happened. On the contrary, Sofia lost all of her strength and died. Montrak never could've saved his beloved. In reality Lucifer played Montrak. He only wanted to bring evil to earth. And he could only achieve this goal with a man filled with hatred. Montrak was the perfect victim. In his rage and despair he squeezed the ring with all his power and released the curse. Put it on! Lucifer promised Montrak that he could bring back Sofia to life when he puts on the glowing ring. But it was a lie. Montrak got cursed and was transformed into a vampire. What happened then? Montrak was hunted by his own knights. He got killed to disappear out of the people's minds. But he passed the ring on to his heirs. Montrak knew that his destiny would repeat itself in form of another human. Many years later a peasant named Wilhelm was chosen to activate the ring once more. No matter how hard he fought against it, the vampires' plan worked out. That means, there's a guy out there who is wearing the ring and is running around like a super vampire? Oh damn! Great story, really good. But I am gone. If I catch any of your type, I will kill them. Okay? Shit! What did Mario do to you? I am sorry. I am so sorry. You know, vampires are creatures of human abyss. Only you humans can create evil. But you are also able to do good. Destroy evil for all time. But therefore you have to be pure, without any hatred and anger. Come on, let's go! Tell me more about yourself. You said they have a hold on you. Can't you just run away? So many vampires tried. It's almost impossible, you can't do it. When you've transformed into a damned child of the night, you're subservient. It's over. What did you do at the gas station? They forced me to bite the vender. He should have been my first victim. So you've never really bitten a human? Well, you came in and saved me from it. And why the gas station vendor? That's easy. To get free gas. We're only allowed to bite people, who are useful or in higher positions. Judges, policemen, doctors. So we have everything we need. And who is commanding you? Who is telling you what to do? Wladislaw. He is the one who is recruiting the army for the Lord. The guy with the hoody? No! That's Caspar, the army's commander. He's a psycho. Wladislaw is pulling the strings. And very soon he will awaken the Lord. You told me that a human can do something good to destroy evil. Yes. But how? Well, maybe, you can do what Wilhelm couldn't. You have to destroy the ring, otherwise we are all lost. Holy shit! Get him! No, no! Stay down. Leave her alone! My little Nicki. You disappointed me. Have you forgotten what you are? Caspar, [ want... Get them out! Chapter Four: Harry and the Huntsmen Sis Hello? Yes, finally you're picking up. When are you getting me? 1 have been waiting for you for an hour now. It's so boring here. Did 1 say, 1 was going Xo pick you up? Are you kidding me? Sorry, but 1 am getting wasted tonight. I am meeting some people. We want to party a bit. Party? You mean getting totally wasted. You know it's mom's birthday tomorrow. I don't care and you know that! Oh stop it. Everything is already all good again. Good? Nah, forget it! Gosh, Harry, don't make a drama out of it. You manage to forgive any dumb-ass, but you don't give a shit about your own family. Why don't you do we mean so little to you? Hey, that's not true. You mean a lot to me. No, that's not true, Harry. You are around and once again have no time. I was so looking forward to seeing you again. Yeah, me too. We will catch up on that. I promise! You always give me that. Take care of yourself, alright? Don't worry, sis! Don't get in any trouble again. I told you, don't worry okay? Well, take care! Susann. Hey, sis! Mister Scholz. Was that one of these darn wolves? What your sister needs now is a lot of rest. I can't believe this. Susann was at a party downtown. I talked to her. These rabid wolves are attacking more cities now. Dr. Heusmann could you come please? Excuse me for a moment please. Here. The files of the new patients. Thanks. And, did you write down the relatives? Yes. Friends, relatives, with all information. Ah, the girl, very good. The assaults by the beasts are getting more and more. But we'll manage that. Hey doctor, could you please look after my sister instead of chatting around! It's alright. You don't have to apologize to me. Everybody is doing what he can. But the truth is that 1 am tired of telling relatives those lies about wolves. Hey, are you freaking kidding me? Who the heck is this? The girl's brother. Harald Scholz. Former soldier Mr. Scholz, you served? Yes, why? And you are currently unemployed, correct? In between jobs! Good. What would you like to do in the future? Hunting down wolves! Okay. You look like, you can handle the truth. Hey, bro, we need to go! Winnie is waiting for us. The bite wound hasn't changed. That's a good sign. Is she asking for blood? No. Good. If she does, you need to let me know immediately. I am sorry. It seems like Susann is harmless. Usually the transformation is faster. Harry, you won't like this, but if she transforms into one of these things, I'll have to... No, you won't do a thing! Maybe we're lucky and the bite wasn't deep enough. Otherwise 1 have to kill her master for her to recover again. There must be a way back to normal life. Well, the thing with the master is just a tale. He is a fantasy. But what if he really exists? Pfff... Harry! It was just a thought. We already know a lot about these beasts, but nothing about their origin. There are still some mysterious facts. It must be a higher power or something like that. I know it sounds crazy, but there are so many clues. Yes. If Susann and all the others are really under this curse, fighting these monsters won't be any easier. Of course, Winnie. All we have to do is kill the master. Susann will be healthy again, I swear. Okay. But can you tell me then where we will find this master? Wow. This is amazing! Wow, wow, wow. Ah, Congressman Kuhn. Mr. Schulzendorf! Harry, may 1 introduce you 10 Mr.Kuhn, Homeland Security. He is in charge of this unit. Ah okay, the prominence from Berlin. Prominence? Gentlemen. I am glad to meet you all here. Nice! But before 1 reveal the good news, 1 have to bring up an unpleasant topic, though! The ministry of internal affairs believes that future operations are threatened. Because one of your men doesn't take discretion seriously. With all respect, 1 can promise that all my men are discreet. Good. 1 just wanted to remind you, though. Remind me? Well, you've forgotten that 1 was the one who was assigned by the government to eliminate the vampires. Oh come on, come on. Please don't talk about fabulous creatures. Biologically they are humans with a genetic mutation. With big teeth, yeah! Well, be seriously, please. Shall I tell you something? It wouldn't be wrong at all to tell the truth to the people. If we clarified the situation, at least many would have the chance to defend themselves. You know that we still cannot explain the mutation. And if we go public, they would all go crazy. Damn, I am going crazy too, right now. You said there are news? Yes, but before that 1 want to hear all facts. So, please. Well, there's not much to tell. The mutants are getting more aggressive and their skin is becoming more resistant. Their skin? Yes! Old reports say that these monsters couldn't exist in daylight 60-70 years ago. They burned in the sun just like that. I told you to be objective. I am only telling you what I've read. Of course, we are trying to get information from them. If they don't want to talk, we execute them. The easiest way is a shot to the head or heart. You have to destroy them massively. Wonderful. You guys know what you do! Keep your eyes and ears open in the fight! Of course, since there is nothing else to do in this wasteland, Right? Why... don't you fight these monsters? Ah I know, you politicians have no idea! Harry, leave it. No, I am so pissed off! We did find something else out though. And you will kiss our asses for that. Harry, eat your apple. We have an important information. One of the mutants said something about Montrak and his heirs. We have no idea who or what is behind this name, but it could be a very important clue to their origin. Really? This information doesn't quite blow me off my chair. 1 wouldn't give any meaning to that. 1 mean, these monsters are insane, we know that. Do you know how difficult it was to make one of them talk? What are your news? We found a huge blood bank in a warehouse. These beasts are probably used by some scientists. But that's just an assumption. I see, an assumption. Well, then I wouldn't give too much meaning to that. Scientists you say? Have you ever thought about that there is a second species? A species which is totally separated from these mutants? Which is nourishing from self-made blood banks? 1 am talking about civilized and intelligent vampires who have been among us, for a long time. Who observe us and laugh at government nerds like you. You are aware that this sounds totally insane? Insane? You know we have to kill these beasts with silver bullets, right? Yes, I've heard of that. Yeah, then don't tell me it sounds insane. Call it by its name. These are vampires, who have nothing to do with your profane intuition. And if you don't want to see it, then it's too late anyway. Lord, there's a rebel amongst us. She wanted to escape with a human. So? Did you catch them? Yes, Lord. Everything is fine. The human shall be the first blood victim for our master. He will be very thirsty. As you wish. And the girl? She will be executed. The command will follow in the next days. Caspar! Tell the major council to come together at the residence. Kilian shall be there too. There are news. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the High Council. Please record the following. We have reached the minimum goal. In the whole federal republic, we are politically and economically well established. We have the once in a lifetime opportunity to take over the whole world. The offensive lies ahead. But before we have to awaken our master. I am forced to do so in the next couple of days. But it's too early for that. The statistics say that our dissemination isn't enough yet. We had a goal for Europe, secure territories, step by step, that was the plan. The Master won't be pleased with our progress. But it has to be done. The mutants are the reason for it. What if they blow our cover? They're too suspicious. What if the humans find the Master's casket? Do you want to take responsibility for that? I can totally understand you. So, it's worse than assumed? A long time ago, a long time ago the mutants have been our animals. Pitiful creatures who ate godforsaken rats. They became blood thirsty monsters. They fought beside us, but now, they act on their own now. And as the Dean of the council 1 can't allow that. Two days ago they planned an attack downtown. In the last minute we managed to stop them. They got their punishment. The Master's awakening may not be threatened by anything. That is the highest priority. Lord, the plan won't leak. We will catch the mutants and cage them. Then there's nothing in the way of the Master's awakening anymore. There's a second peril point which is a thorn in my side. The vampire hunters. You will take care of them. Excuse me, but how shall 1 do that? Also, the huntsmen have helped you unconsciously all these years. They took care of the mutants so you could silently radiate. Sooner or later they will submit to you anyway. You're a pain in the neck! All hazards must be eliminated upfront. Or do you dare to disagree? No, Lord. Of course not. But alone, I have no chance against their organization. You will play the bait. You will bring them to the residence by midnight. Until then, the Master is already awakened. And then he can kill them all at once. How shall I reach out to them? Well, you are known as a vampire expert, right? Yes, that's true, Lord. So, listen what I have to say. Lachmann asks Dear viewers, welcome back to "Lachmann asks". Still here with me is Kilian Benz, historian and vampire expert. Mr. Benz, so you say, that's how 1 understood in the first part of our show, that the government is telling us lies and fairy tales? Yes, that's true. There has never been an epidemic. These stories about rabid wolves are just ridiculous. It was only told so the people won't get scared and frightened. As I said before, they were vampires, and they are more powerful than ever before. What about the witnesses who have seen the monsters? All these missing people? Come on, that's no coincidence. There is a Franconian saga to this, indeed. 1 have researched the relevant facts and interrelations in the region. Harry, will you come see me again tomorrow? Of course, what are you thinking? And now sleep. You need to rest. Frankfurt am Main Yes, please? Good afternoon! You must be Harry Scholz. I was waiting for you. Please, take a seat. Oh, excuse me. Kilian Benz. How are you? Do you want something to drink? May I ask what this is? This? Oh, we will get back to that in a bit. First of all, I am very happy you've contacted me. 1 value you and your team very much. But most of all the operations you do. You've heard about us? Of course! We are in the same business, so to speak. But, my approach is a little bit different than yours to put it that way. 1 am more of a private investigator and historian. 1 have been dealing with this phenomenon for many years now. It has become my specialty. Pardon. My business card. Well, normally I work on my own. But as you may have noticed, the situation is getting worse. What do you mean? As I said, I am a historian and expert in this matter. But I am also a business man. After we have a deal, you will receive all further information. I suggest, 1 collect all the relevant information and you will take care of the operation. You'll get half of the compensation upfront and the other half when the operation is completed. Wait a minute. My team and 1 are taking care that someone like you can still take a step outside the door. And then you want to offer me a deal? You wanted to know what this is, right? Tell me about it. 1 have been searching for the original vampire for a very long time. Until I finally found Montrak in his crypt. Was the first vampire ever. And if you might ask, Montrak is already dead. He is just a bunch of ashes. But inside his sarcophagus I found a scroll. On this scroll there was his whole story. Really? And that's the scroll? Only a part of it and unfortunately only a photograph. 1 was photographically documenting the sarcophagus and the scroll when a creepy appearance forced me to run from the crypt. 1 was able to only take this one picture. And that was the end of the scroll. But luckily, the end of the scroll contains the most important part. This is the prophecy. It says that in the middle ages Montrak was killed by a knight. But already back then a new vampire master had been created. Where is this jerk? Do we have a deal? My colleague will arrange everything. Good. This "jerk", how you call him, is asleep. His sarcophagus was in the same crypt. He waits for the day when his heirs spread enough. Then he will be awakened. What are we waiting for then? We can kill this pale anorexic in his own crypt. 1 said, his casket WAS in the same crypt. They brought it to a secret place. But I am sure that the awakening will be in the next few days. How do you know that? 1 am observing these vampires daily. I am never wrong. Where will this fucking awakening take place? There is a residence, a huge property. Some of them already arrived there. You have to be prepared very well. No problem. I will inform you about further details. Hey, Susann. Hey, calm. It's nice to see you that optimistic. The little one hears everything. Do you think? Of course, Susann can feel it. But what if something goes wrong? Nothing will go wrong. She will be okay again. We'll have this bastard soon. Of course, Harry. But we have to be prepared. You have to get used to the thought that you have to say goodbye. Why haven't 1 never spent more time with her? You have time with her now. Spend the time with her and appreciate it. You should stay with her. For the next two days. I've been waiting for so long to find the master. And now we're so close. If someone kills him, it will be me. No, I will do that. You'll take care of Susann. Don't get too crazy with all these bloodsucker stories. It's eating you up inside. That's my business! And I want to make sure! Buddy, it is more than important to me that you look after my sister. You are the only one 1 trust 100%. You don't get it, do you? It's not about that. You, you, you are totally off the rail. Come on, buddy! Don't you get it? You need a clear head for battle. And you don't have it at all. You will regret it, if you leave her now. What do you mean? Things will turn to the worst soon. And you won't be there! I'll have to release her and I am so not up for that. FUCK! Hello? Listen carefully now. I saw the whole thing. The master's casket is inside the residence now. You can't lose any time now. Around midnight they will hold the ceremony. You have to be there earlier to prevent it. My job is done. Now you have to handle the practical part. Alright. No, no, it's a secret. Three of my best men and 1. We will be there. Last Chapter: Operation Wolf Hunting My dear delegates of the countries, members of the High Council. Please take a seat. Listen to me! Ever since our being, death has never had a meaning to us. We spread our race like the great Count Montrak wanted us to. We accepted enemies and resistance, no matter at what cost. But we had to bow to the humans. Their wars always threw us back. For so many centuries we had to hide. Now! Now the time for a new era has come! Our brothers and sisters are gathering right now everywhere around the country. In a few minutes we will give the signal to our sleepers to conquer Germany! Tonight Montrak's heir will be awakened to lead us in the fight against humans! Ready when you are. Kill them! Go to the back! Let the animals out of the cage! Go and take him! Come, come here. I know exactly who you are, pathetic human. How is your sister? She cried out for you. Is she already one of us? I promise, I will take care of her. The fuck you'll do! Lord, we should continue. Bring me the human sacrifice! The silver feels good, doesn't it? 1 will rule aside the Master now. Your time is over. You dumb asshole. Where is my army? Master, your army awaits you, spread all around the country! We will go to war! But before that transform me! Drink my blood and I will be your most loyal servant! The ring! Damn it, you need to destroy the ring! Come on, you fool! Now! Destroy the ring! Destroy the ring to lift the curse. It's too late. - No, don't believe him! Destroy the ring! - Your sister is dead. Killed by the hand of your loyal friend. No, no, she isn't dead. She will make it. I can see it. Destroy the ring! - She is dead. No, don't trust him! He is lying, he's lying. Destroy the ring! No! Let your feelings go. Don't let him get to you, no! Humans are the real evil. They took your sister from you. Destroy the ring! Yes, now you have the power! Put the ring on your finger. Then you can bring back your sister. Shit! Believe me, you can bring your sister back to life. Don't listen to him. No, no! No! ll You fooll!! Noooooooo! I! ll Wilhelm inspired me to take the risk to fight evil. I was the first and over centuries many generations followed who fought the vampires. Even if Lucifer seemingly had been defeated, humanity should have been warned. Because evil will always be a part of us. Hey. Hi! Can I come in? Sure, come on in. Nicki. Wait. Nicki. What would you do if 1 got an appetite for something again? Appetite for what? You!
