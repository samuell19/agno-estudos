In the early 13th century, an heretical Christian sect, known as the Cathars, was gaining popularity in Southern France. They did not recognize the authority of the Roman Catholic Church, and believed the Pope to be the Antichrist. Thus, the Pope saw them as a serious threat to his power. In response, he waged a ruthless and barbaric 20 year crusade against them. The last surviving Cathars sought sanctuary at the castle of Montségur in the foothills of the Pyrenees. Here, a sympathetic force of about 100 knights and soldiers managed to hold off a 10,000-strong Catholic mercenary army for more than nine months. Ah, Guillaume, I pray you bear good tidings. I'm afraid not, my Lord. The eastern barbican has been captured. How? It was well defended. Somehow they gained access through a secret entrance, and overpowered our sentries. I suspect we have a traitor in our midst. Damn them! What are our options? I'd expect they'll bring in more reinforcements and then move their trebuchet closer to breach the castle walls. We must stop them quickly. It's our only chance. Our people, did we lose many? No, most of the villagers managed to get inside the castle before we sealed the main gate. What would you have us do now? We have no alternative, we must retake the barbican. Our best chance would be while they're distracted moving their trebuchet. There's a slim chance we could destroy that as well. Slim indeed. We barely have 100 knights and men at arms left. If we fail... Well, we can't fail or ultimately they'll kill us all. This castle may have offered us protection over the past year, but we're trapped with no obvious means of escape. My Lords, is it true what they're saying about today's encounter? Yes, yes, unfortunately. I will pray for their deliverance. You have 200 Parfait that are unwilling to bear arms and fight. I think we would all be better served, if you were to pray for a change of heart. We have taken vows to do no violence. Our lives are in God's hands. This we cannot alter. Then I suggest you prepare for the worst. Our time is short. O Brethren, give ear to a noble Lesson. We ought always to watch and pray, for we see this world nigh to a conclusion. We ought to strive to do good works... I fear where this is all leading. Bertrand is preparing his people for the worst. It's only a matter of time now until the castle falls. We ought to covet little, for we are at the latter end. And so we seek daily the signs to be accomplished. What will happen to us? That depends on what Lord Raymond does next and if he's able to negotiate with the Seneschal or not. With the increase of evil and the demise of good... King Louis and the Pope only want our lands and wealth. They've shown no mercy. Writings of Saint Paul. They haven't even spared children from the fires. No man living can know the end. The castle may fall, but Lord Guillaume and I will protect you. Our knights do not surrender. We have sworn to fight to the death if that is what's required. For we know not whether we shall die today or tomorrow. That's very noble, but what are a few knights against 10,000? I fear for my virtue as well as my death. For we are in the last times. Do not fear, for I will not let them take you alive. Your commitment to my end is appreciated, but unfortunately, not very comforting. Please excuse me, I must check on Meg's wellbeing. Let us meditate and pray. Before the fire consumes you, heretic, and you feel the flames, if you fail to recant tonight, why do you refuse to believe in the true and holy baptism? Burn her! It's okay. You were just having a bad dream. It was so real. I'm scared. Do you still remember where we used to play in the fields and you would hide, and I couldn't find you? That was so much fun. You could never work out where I'd gone. Yes it was. We'll have to do it again when this is all over. I'll get you some warm milk and cake, and you can tell me where you would hide. No, that would be silly, then you'd know where to find me. Ah, I thought I could trick you while you're sleepy, but you're too smart for that. Do you think we could go back home again? I hope so. An angel in the night, or am I mistaken? I think my Lord mistakes me for another. No my Lady, your kindness precedes you. A light of hope to those of us that remain. It is but a candle. What keeps you up so late? I make peace with my God, for in the morning we do battle again. I speak frankly, as I fear this may be our last moment. I pray not. If not for your skill and courage, we would have already endured a slow and horrible death. This senseless persecution needs to be stopped. King Louis and Hughes d'Arcis would burn us all for that fanatic in Rome. Yet you're here defending us. Templars are of the Catholic Order. I really don't understand. This new pope has an evil agenda. Even my fellow Templars fear to speak out against him. Now with King Louis supporting him, I don't believe anyone is safe. If you are discovered, won't that make it worse for them? So be it. I cannot with all conscience not protect the innocent. It's why our Templar Order was originally created. It's time. How's Bietta? Keeping a brave front. Are your men ready? They are ready. And you? Always. Over here! Over here! It's a trap! Retreat, it's a trap! It's an honor to die with you, my brother. This is not our time. There will be another day to fight for our honor. What were you thinking? I've never known you to run from a fight. There were too many of them, Guillaume. We would have all been slaughtered. You're too impulsive and you don't think! That was our last chance to destroy the trebuchet and force them off the mountain. They'll kill us all now at their leisure. You're right. All I could think about was staying alive to save Philippa. I'm sorry. There's no time to be sorry. Just tend to the wounded. Any news? Nothing good, we were heavily outnumbered. Have we lost many. No, but we have wounded. Fortunately, Guillaume and Simon fought a strong rear guard action allowing our men enough time to retreat. Is Pierre all right? And Raymond? Lord Raymond is on the wall with Pierre organizing defenses. He and Guillaume will be along shortly. Thank you, thank you. They will need food and rest, and the girls will help tend the wounded. Food we can provide. Rest, well, might be a bit harder to come by. I'm scared. I'm scared for us all. We must be strong. We are but a small part in a heavenly battle. God has prepared our path and we must follow where he has chosen, that is our destiny. The choice of letting good men die fighting to protect your pacifist hide seems an unlikely choice God would make. Your belief in reincarnation makes you irresponsible. "We can always fix it in the next life." Well what if this one is all we get? By the Saints, Bietta, I know that you're scared and upset, but please respect our beliefs. These beliefs have brought the full force of the Catholic church down on our heads. What if they're wrong? She is just upset. Come on girls, there is much work to do. Lord, give me strength. I'm not sure what we should do. We, we need to remove the arrow. I'm sorry, Jean. I've got to remove it. Drink this. It will help with the pain. Philippa! We need to stop the bleeding. The Bishop has been using herbs and honey for the deeper wounds. Please hurry, he's bleeding badly. What went wrong? They knew we were coming. Pierre didn't help, running for cover. At this stage, there's no point laying blame, but we can't afford to lose any more men. So, now what? We were lucky to survive. Now it's only a matter of time before they get reinforcements and try a full assault. Well we are grateful for you for getting us this far, but now myself and my followers must prepare ourselves for our martyrdom. Though perhaps if we were to surrender, you and your people might be spared. If I send a messenger to the Seneschal seeking terms of surrender, it may buy some more time. In that case, the Templar involvement cannot be revealed, that would put the whole order at risk. They need to believe that I acted as a lone wolf. What about Simon? I have a plan. His past relationship with the Seneschal could prove useful. He should be your messenger. Trust me with this. You have my word. We will need a good cover story, in case of torture and capture. I'm also led to believe that you possess an ancient artifact. One that could unlock secrets. Secrets that must never fall into enemy hands. Is this true? Yes, after the crucifixion, Mary Magdalene was brought here from Egypt. What does this have to do with our current situation? When Mary was dying, she entrusted our good men with an ancient book. Now, we believe that hidden within its writings are clues to those secrets that... How did you know? After the first crusade to the Holy Land, the Knights Templar were based on the old site of Solomon's Temple. While there, they uncovered text describing a powerful ancient relic. We believe that Mary's book may be the key to finding it. Do you still have the book? No, it was hidden nearby before we were trapped here. If the enemy know of it, and we surrender, it's only a matter of time before someone is tortured into revealing its location. Then we must make every effort to recover it now, before it's too late. Only one person knows of its whereabouts, and besides, aren't you forgetting something? We're in a completely hopeless situation, surrounded with no means of escape. No trap is ever perfect. My lady, you surprised me. Why, what have I done? A blacksmith's workshop? It's hardly the sort of place where I'd expect to find you. Gerard is being kind enough to make a sword for me. A gift for someone? No, it's for me. Since the Parfait won't fight, I need to protect myself and Meg from the invaders, and possibly Simon. I don't think Simon intends to hurt you. He's like a puppy in your presence. I'm surprised he's not with you now. He is off running an errand for me, and besides, I have a greater needs of Gerard's talents today. May I also suggest, if you feel the need for a weapon, maybe a crossbow might be a safer option for everyone. What do you need, my Lord? I need some small iron spikes that can support the weight of a knight. Yes, my Lord. I'm onto it. More heat, my friend. I'll leave you two to bond. I'm so tired of parsnips. Well, it's better than nothing. I know, but I'd do almost anything for some pork. Or fish, fresh fish. It must be a year since we've had any fish. How's Jean? Any improvement? I'm hoping some food will help him to regain his strength. Hopefully the soldiers will get tired of all this and leave, and then things can get back to normal. I don't know if that will ever happen now. Why do you think that? We've had sieges before and they eventually gave up and went away. I know, but they've never managed to get any men up the mountain before. What will happen to us if they take the castle? I think they only want the Cathars, we should be safe, because we're from a noble family. But I'm not. I'm just a servant. I'm sure father will look after you, and besides, you're not a Cathar. If only Pierre had not killed the Friars of the Inquisition. The Pope might have left us alone. Don't let Philippa hear you saying that. I don't blame him, they were doing horrible things to people, but it was still a stupid thing to do. After all, they did represent the Pope. I know. Pierre's impulsive and doesn't think things through, but he loves Philippa and he's still a good man. Do you think we could escape before the castle falls? I would prefer to take my chances rather than be captured. Every day it's getting harder to get things in from the outside. Well, our duty is to stay and support our father. However, I would understand it if you wanted to try and escape, Mary. Where would you go? I have family to the north, they would look after me. Don't be sad. That's better. So, what have you been up to? Just watching the pigeons landing on the wall. They must have a nest. I wish I were able to fly. You must be careful. There may be archers watching the windows now. I'm enjoying this wine, it's quite good. Simon. This day's full of surprises. Get him a seat and some wine. Thank you, my Lord. Bishop Petrus, you're a long way from the comforts of Rome. Indeed. I was unaware of your presence here. Skip the formalities. What brings you to Montsegur? Chance, and poor timing. I was returning from Templar duties in Toulouse, when I decided to check on the situation with Lord Raymond. Unfortunately, my departure was delayed, when you laid siege to the castle. Somewhat of an inconvenience. My apologies, but Bishop Petrus was most convincing and insistent. I think you'll find Lord Raymond will be defaulting on any outstanding debts to the Templars this year. Only if you succeed and quickly. I've heard they have some reinforcements on the way. Why are you still here? The Templars have no interest in this. It suited me at the time, but now it has been put upon me by Lord Raymond to mediate acceptable terms for their surrender. We don't negotiate with heretics, we burn them. It's God's way. Your persistence in continuing this crusade must be a costly exercise. It has dragged on, but God's work requires patience, unfortunately. I think if you want this to end quickly, you're going to have to sweeten the deal. Those reinforcements could be here by Easter. Bishop, would you and Friar Tomas kindly leave us? I need to discuss some things in private with Simon. If you must. Friar Tomas and I will tend to our flock. I respect Lord Raymond's efforts in defending the heretics, but the church has my hands tied in this matter. Our real enemy lies in Jerusalem. This is just the Devil's distraction, chasing a few misguided heretics. They're a harmless bunch. Damned if I'll get on the wrong side of the Pope to a save a few peasants. Fortune favors the strong. That may be, but I think you'll find a little more profit if you show some mercy. I see no winners in this encounter. This new Pope's fanatical. He wants to eradicate these heretics once and for all. There are spies everywhere. We both need to be cautious and watch our backs. No one is safe. Then show some compromise and this whole episode will come to a quick end. They're not all heretics, but with no hope, ordinary men can become heroes. Besides, think of the time and money you'll save. Popes don't last forever. What you say has merit. My men are restless and want to return home, but I must satisfy the demands of the Bishop. What you do with your knights is not my concern. What would you have me tell Lord Raymond? I will consider an unconditional surrender, and spare Lord Raymond and his family, along with his knights, but be careful, my archers are not very selective. I cannot guarantee your safety. I suggest you avoid any delays in leaving this area. Being a Templar may not save you. Accepted, but it would be wise to remember, nothing can save you if you make the Templars your enemy. Hopefully our next encounter will be in less hostile circumstances. Indeed. How did it go? Tense. For Lord Hughes, it's business as usual, however Bishop Petrus is another matter. He's a heartless fanatic, unlikely to yield, just another puppet to the Pope. Well, that's always been the case. It doesn't leave us much room to maneuver. After our recent loses, we don't have the men to hold them off any longer. If you're prepared to surrender, we may be able to negotiate better conditions and save the women and children. Either way, the Cathars are doomed. Save yourselves, you've done the best you can. Save the women and children if you can, but as for myself and my good people, we know there's no hope of survival, only martyrdom. Simon, when you went to their camp, how were their troops deployed? They're moving their men towards the main access, gathering for a major assault. I have an idea, it's a long shot, but with their lines depleted, it might be possible to smuggle some people out. If it helps, I can stall for more time with negotiations. Then we have a plan. What numbers are you contemplating? Not many, perhaps just a few, spread over several nights. They will need to be fit enough to travel quickly. Do what you can. My place is here with my wife and family. I have sworn to fight to the death. I have other needs for you, Simon. I can't leave. I've sworn to protect Bietta. As you have with every other pretty lady in France. Her best chance is for you to stay focused on the task ahead. So be it. What would you have me do? Listen carefully. I need you to return to their camp with Lord Raymond's terms of surrender. Then leave the area showing no further interest in the outcome. That should allay any further suspicion of Templar activity. My Lords, this inquisition will only stop when they believe that myself and my Cathars have all been destroyed. We have accepted our fate and we've made our peace with God, but others like Meg and Bietta, they might be spared. They are the last of their bloodline. Unfortunately Bertrand, many bloodlines are about to be lost, it's hardly relevant. Perhaps if all your people just promise to be good Catholics, they would be spared. No, no, no never, it's better to burn now than submit to Satan and burn forever. This duality you believe in, between good and evil, is it worth dying for? Just tell them what they want to hear. You can take it back later. Think of the children. They don't even understand what's happening. That is a decision that every Cathar must make, and also, our faith is not the only one under attack. They're blaming the Jews for killing Jesus. They're seizing and burning copies of the Talmud. It's no longer just about the Christian belief, it's about wealth and power. Was it ever anything else? We digress. If this plan's to work, it must remain confidential, otherwise those who escape will be hunted down. Indeed, secrecy is most important. I thought I might find you here. It's a beautiful night. The stars are bright and the air is crisp and fresh. It's a bit too cold for my liking. I like the cold, it's especially beautiful when it snows. It's so peaceful and quiet tonight. It seems oddly strange. They've stopped the constant bombardment with the trebuchet while talks are underway. Do you think we'll all die? Eventually, but not tonight. It's not dying that bothers me as much, as what they'll do to us first. Try not to think about it. I can't help it. They just seem to delight in the sadistic torture of so many beautiful, harmless people. The thought of slowly burning to death terrifies me. Why? How do you cope? I'm a soldier and a Templar. Death is always with us. We need to learn to deal with our mortality otherwise we would be totally consumed by fear. Bertrand tells me that in death I am born again into another life, that we are heavenly angels trapped in our earthly bodies. That's why it's easier for him. But I don't know what to believe any more. My experience is to trust only my instincts, and so far they haven't failed me yet. I've seen good men, great men, on both sides die for their faith. If there is a caring God, I haven't found him. My mother always said that we don't need to look for God, as he is everywhere, whether we believe it or not. Well if there ever was a good time for God to reveal himself, it's now. We need a miracle, and we need it now. You should get some rest. Tomorrow will be a big day. No one must know about this. You're secret is safe. Ah, Simon. I've found some rope. I hope it's enough. I need to meditate and pray. Take care. Simon, we have work to do. Lead the way. I think you'll be pleased to know that I've decided to take Bietta and Meg with us. Have you told her? No, not yet, the less people know, the better. I understand. What next? Stick to our plan. Deliver Lord Raymond's surrender document to Lord Hughes, and then when you think it's safe, meet up with us. Take care. If this fails, we'll next see you in heaven. Well, let's make this work. God be with you. And also with you. Are you sure that there's no other way? I'm worried about the girls. We have so few men left, that we were lucky to have survived the last attack. I know, those mercenaries were ruthless. Can't we wait this out until some reinforcements arrive? If they were coming, they would have been here by now. But the Lord of Toulouse, and King of Aragon have both promised to send knights. I know, but I think they've realized the futility of fighting such a large force. I just hope God hears our prayers. You can inform Lord Raymond that I will require hostages as an act of good faith. His request is somewhat unusual. I'll leave that up to you to negotiate, my Lord. I've wasted enough time here already. Suit yourself. Give my regards to Lord Guillaume and the Templars when next you see them. Rumor has it that he's been off preparing and recruiting for a new crusade to the Holy Land. Then I'd better hurry, sounds like an adventure not to be missed. Yes, riches and opportunity are there for the taking. Indeed, so once you've finished here, I expect we'll have your full support in the new crusade. Of course. God's will be done. The Pope will be delighted. He makes me feel uneasy. How sure are you of his allegiances? Simon comes from a good family. I have no reason to doubt his loyalty to the church, or the King. Besides, there's little he could do to upset your plans. We will see. Well, I will go first, and make sure it's safe. Are you sure there's no other way? If there was another way, I would take it. I can see a couple of ledges where you can stop and catch your breath. I'm scared of heights, and what about Meg? If I can manage, I'm sure you're fine. Just try not to look down. Meg's small, she can be lowered down with all our gear. We'll be careful. Good luck, and Godspeed to you both. Meg, do as you're told and hold on tight. Given the choice, I would stay and fight. Sneaking off into the night is not the Templar way. This mission gives us all some hope. Some must survive for the future. There are greater battles ahead. Be careful. Please be careful. We're almost there. Rest up and catch your breath while they lower Meg. This better work. There's no way I could get back up. Shh. You need to be quiet, just in case there are sentries down below. Will we be there soon? It won't be long, and then you can rest. I'm tired. Shh. We need to be quiet. Did you hear that? It's probably nothing. It might just be a badger. Let's not go looking for trouble. You're probably right, with my luck it's just a bear. I've got other plans for tonight. Please don't hurt me again. I'm not a Cathar. Quiet! I just want to go home. If you're good and you do as you're told, we might let you go. But only if you're good! - Aren't you going to help? - I cannot save everyone. But it's Mary, the maid from the castle. I'm sorry, but I cannot risk losing you and Meg. Come on, Meg. There's nothing we can do here. Did they accept? They're prepared to give us a 14 day truce, to allow each person time to consider their allegiances and to and make peace with God. And then what? What Raymond is trying to say, is after that 14 day period, those who have repented and swear their allegiance to the Pope will be spared. And if we don't? If you refuse, then you'll be taken and either tortured or burnt to death. That's what they've done everywhere else. There's also a demand for hostages to guarantee our compliance. Hostages are out of the question! Do you think I want to surrender? If we don't comply, they will continue their attack and kill every last one of us. We have no alternative left than to accept. Come, I'll negotiate my own terms. Take whatever you need, and may God be with you both. Let them go. She's our daughter! Philippa made her choices when she married Pierre. Is there nothing we can do to stop this? What's happening? I'm not sure. The horn, it's sounding our surrender. What should we do? Hide. Escape if you can. I can't leave you here. Forget about me, I'm done for. Get Bertrand to give me the Consolamentum. I want to make peace with God. You can't take the Consolamentum, they'll burn you as a heretic. My wound has become inflamed. It will take me long before they take this castle. I can't bear to live without you. Esclarmonde, we need to find our parents. Go without me. I need to be here with Jean. I'll come back for you, as fast as I can. Is it true? We've just surrendered? I had no alternative. But at least we had a chance. Now they'll do whatever they want with us. No, they've agreed to a short truce. This allows people the time to get their lives in order and consider their allegiances. After that, if you seek forgiveness and agree to follow the Church of Rome, you will be set free. After all they've done, you trust them? What about the others? There is no option. This way, at least our family is safe. No. No! Where's mother? I must see her. I believe she's in the chapel. She needed some time alone. Why? Out of my way! What is so important that you would disturb me in my meditation? You must stop father from surrendering the castle. I think it's too late for that, besides, it is the only option left if any of us are to survive. You don't understand. Then explain your concerns. Jean is dying and Bertrand is going to perform the Consolamentum. Well we cannot stop him if he chooses to die as a Cathar. But I think Esclarmonde is going to, as well. What! They will burn her if she does. Take me to her, quickly. It's too late! Lady Corba, you're most welcome to join us. The presence of the Holy Spirit has deeply touched our hearts tonight. If the Catholics find out that Esclarmonde has made these vows, they will burn her. Her eternal salvation is now assured, and they will both live again. Jean's getting very weak, he hasn't much time left. We should allow them some time together. This must kept secret. No one must know, not even Raymond. I understand. I will instruct the others as well. Ah, Bertrand, what have we done? We can rest here today and continue on in the night. I'm going to go for a wash in the stream so don't run off. And if you see anyone, hide. Shouldn't a lady be more cautious as to where she chooses to bathe? A gentleman would look away while a lady bathes. He would. After being cooped up in the castle for so long, I couldn't resist. Perhaps you should join me. That is not the Templar way. Oh! You're always on guard. You never sleep or take a moment to stop and just relax. Is that's why Templars don't bathe? It rusts the armor. Then it might be prudent to keep downwind from your enemy. What brings you to my camp? We're under orders, stopping anyone passing to and from Montsegur. What is your mission, Sir Knight? And who is the lady? This is Lady Bietta of Aragon. I've been commissioned to protect and escort her on her pilgrimage to Toulouse. Then you will need permission from Lord Hughes if you want to pass through this area. I am Guillaume De Sonnac, Templar Knight and Preceptor of Guyenne. Do you dare challenge my authority? You must submit to our authority or suffer the consequences. So be it. Here, Let me help. What if they're not alone? We will worry about that later. You did well to beat them both. I couldn't have done it without Meg's help. Meg, are you okay? Meg? You took your time getting here. I see you've been busy. I could've used some help. And I could've used a horse. It was a long walk. Hopefully that's the last of the sentries. Any news? I think Lord Hughes bought my story, but it still doesn't look promising for those left behind in the castle. Why? What's happened? They've been collecting large quantities of firewood and preparing an area to burn the Cathars. Say no more. Our concerns are here now. They were the sentries we saw last night. We should go back and help that servant, Mary. What? Mary? There's no time. We cannot risk putting you and Meg in any more danger. Help me to hide these bodies. I'm so tired. Try and rest. I won't leave. I love you so much. I know. They can take away everything, but they can never take away our love. That is ours forever. I am here. I always will be. We used to live near here. Why did you leave? The soldiers came and burned our homes and then killed our families. Were you hurt? No, when the soldiers came, Meg and I were here, collecting berries. We hid until they left. It was terrible. Meg still has nightmares about it. It doesn't seem to upset her being here. Her mind has shut out a lot of what happened. It's how she copes with it. We only talk about the good times. Meg always loved coming here and chasing the rabbits. Rabbits! I'm getting hungry. I still have some bread and cheese. There should also be some mushrooms and things nearby. Simon, help Bietta, and while you're at it, check out the area. Meg's looking tired. She can rest now while I set up the campsite. Meg. How many soldiers have you killed? I thought you wanted to sleep. I can't, I keep thinking about that man. I didn't mean to kill him. I just wanted to make him stop. What you did saved my life, so you did a good thing. Try not to think about it. Try to think of something else, something more pleasant. Do you like Bietta? I thought I had escaped the Inquisition. Did you not want to sleep? I think she likes you. She is kind and caring with everyone. And very intelligent for a woman, but she talks too much, just like you. Now get some sleep. Why did you become a Templar knight? Being the youngest son in my family, there wasn't much opportunity. I wanted more excitement. A chance to travel, and see the world. How's that working out? Well at the moment, a lot harder than I thought. Guillaume doesn't make anything easy. On the contrary, being a Templar is a harsh existence. Guillaume's been quite supportive, all things considered. What's he like? He's quiet, circumspect, a bit of a mystery at times. We should head back. It's safer as a group. Where's Meg? She was here a minute ago. You were supposed to be looking after her. I must have dozed off. Simon, go find her. She cannot have gone far. I'll look in the other direction. Wait. I can't afford to lose you both. She'll be back soon. Just once I leave you to look after her, just once! And you lose her. You're so useless. Apparently. Look, just calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! What if she gets caught? She will be okay. She's probably off just trying to help find food. She's all I've got now. I know, but she'll be okay. Look, trust me. I did, and look what happened. Look, while they're gone, we need to sort something out. What now? It's too dangerous in this area, we must keep moving. Just what are you wanting from me? We need to recover the Cathar relics before we run into any more surprises. Now, where exactly did you hide them? I can't tell you. Bertrand told me not to trust anyone. He may have, but he also told me to get them to a safe place, before Hughes discovers they're gone. They're somewhere near here. What do you mean somewhere? Well I don't know, exactly, I got Meg to hide them. Meg? She found a small cave nearby where she used to play. I could never find it or her. So you entrusted one of the greatest treasures in the world to a 10 year old? I thought no one would ever suspect her. You never cease to amaze me. Meg's vanished! Did she come back here? No. What do mean by vanished? I thought I saw her, one minute she was there, the next she was gone. I thought she might have come back here. We need to find her, it will be dark soon, and we cannot risk being seen with a fire at night. Where have you been? We were all so worried about you. I thought you'd want this. Guard it well. Simon, help me to secure the area before dark. How are you progressing with Bietta? That woman! A difficult creature. Not one to be underestimated. Where are they going? I've no idea, but you stay here, no more running off. That Guillaume can be so annoying. Look, Bietta's up to something. We need to be careful. What makes you think that? Think about it. She does not follow the Cathar beliefs, yet Bertrand entrusted her with their most valuable relic. I hadn't thought about that, but you're right. I think it's too easy to be distracted by her beauty. It can be a trap. She's just a woman. What could she possibly do? Never underestimate women, they can be much more cunning than men. Trust me, I know. I'll keep that in mind. What now? We need to head north to Toulouse where we have allies. Then that is a long walk. The horses are gone, they were eaten by the troops during winter. Life is never easy. We would be less conspicuous on foot though, and that does give me more time to find out what is in that book. Why don't we just take it? If we lose Bietta's trust, we will never find out what she knows about its secrets. Now that we know she's got it, we shouldn't let her out of our sight. You're right. We had better head back. Meg, let me see that amulet on your necklace. Hide it away, and don't let anyone see it. Interesting reading? Did you see anyone? It looks clear. We should be right for the evening. We'll take turns to keep watch, just in case. It's going to be a cold night, so we've been preparing a fire. We cannot risk a fire. Someone might see it. She's just a little girl. We can't let her freeze. All right then, just keep it small. I'm sorry to disturb your meals, your Grace, I have news. Well, get on with it. Two of our perimeter sentries are missing. Probably more deserters. Take some men and search the area. Let me know what you find. - Yes my Lord. - Lord Hughes, if you don't mind, I'd like to send one of my friars to accompany them. Not at all. Who do you have in mind? Tomas. Friar Tomas, you can join them. Yes, your worship. If you insist. Why the interest in a couple of missing sentries? We've had a few desert lately. No interest. I just wanted some more duck before Tomas ate everything. The man suffers from gluttony. It's getting late. I think we should head back. We need to know what happened to the sentries. They'd be long gone by now, and besides I'm getting tired and hungry. Over here! Keep the noise down. There could be anyone out here. Where are the sentries? Please, please help me. The two guards that were here. Where are they? I don't know. Please, do you have some water? Did you see which way they went? She knows nothing. Shall I set her free? No, go check on the soldiers. I'll question her. I think they went this way! I've had enough of this. What now? We need to keep searching. I hate to see them grovel. Finish her. I'm sorry. Shh. They haven't seen us. They're probably looking for those guards. We cannot risk them seeing the girls. Shh, follow me. I've got an idea. Lovely evening! Friar Tomas, isn't it a bit late for you to be out? You should put those away before you cut yourselves. I thought you'd have long left this area by now. I'm on foot, or have you forgotten what happened with the horses. Regrettable, but necessary. What keeps you up so late, and so far from the safety of your camp? Some sentries are missing. Hardly seems worth it. This time of year, they've probably all gone home to be with their families. So you haven't seen them? As Lord Hughes says, the sentries are not that selective. I've avoided them where I can. It's not that safe out here. I hadn't considered that. Take me back to the camp. Your Holiness, I don't think that wise, we haven't fully searched the area. Do as you're told. This entire episode has been a complete waste of my time. Sorry to disturb you. Sleep well, and may you have a safe journey. And you also. We found a peasant girl earlier. Friar Tomas ordered her death for no good reason. Why tell me? Your Templars have not participated in this unholy crusade. I'd ask you to pray for her soul, for I fear she was a good Christian. You have my word. You should go before you draw attention to yourself. Thank you, my Lord. Well, that worked well. Let's hope our luck holds out. I do not trust that friar. He comes off as a bit slow. Do not underestimate him. He has quite a reputation for cruelty. I know. I heard tonight that he had a peasant girl killed. It was probably Mary. Those guards had her at their camp. I should have tried to help her when I had the chance. We can't keep dragging Meg around the countryside. It's too dangerous. What do you suggest? We leave her? Of course not! If only we had horses. The only ones that are left are well guarded. We should split up. We can move faster, find help and come back here for the girls. You may be right. Bietta, you know the area a lot better than us, what do you suggest? I know! Her hiding place. Simon, take the girls there and keep them safe. I have some unfinished business. How will you find us? Leave that up to me. Forgive me, my Lord, I have failed to save another one of your innocent children. I pray that you take this girl, Mary, and let her soul find eternal peace and forgiveness in Heaven. My Lord, it's too late to save me. No, don't give up. Come on, get up. Quick, over here! Come, come. Mary... She's gone. No! I will avenge her death! I'm scared. Will they get us too? When Guillaume returns, we'll get away from all this madness. Find somewhere safe. If he returns. I've never seen him act so recklessly. Surely he knows, one man cannot save the world. I need some time alone to pray. Can you keep an eye out on Meg? Of course. Meg, would you like to go look at the pond? That's a nice necklace. Can I have a look? I'm not supposed to show it to anyone. That's okay, where did you get it from? Bietta gave it to me before we went to the castle. It was supposed to be our secret. Don't worry, I wont tell anyone. I see it's a late night for both of us. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb... My dear friend, you're always welcome. The short time we have left is better spent with friends than alone. This may be my last chance to speak with you, and I want to thank you for making us welcome and for sheltering us here in your home. The kindness and charity we've been shown, the sacrifices you've endured trying to protect us have been a gift from God. You gave us hope and precious time. My failure to keep you safe is my deepest regret. My knights were prepared to do whatever it takes if we thought it would help, and we almost succeeded. Unfortunately, it just wasn't enough. Further fighting is pointless. Enough of your family has been lost already. You have fought honorably and I want to thank you on behalf of us all. Is there anything else we can do? These are all my possessions. There's not much, but I would like you to have them. There's some cloth and some salt and herbs. Thank you, Bertrand. I will always treasure them. My time at the castle here has given me many moments of great joy, but also some of deep regret. How so? I'm not immune to self doubt. There is so much that we do that we attribute to God's will. Things that we must accept in blind faith. Like all men, I'm not infallible. My decisions were based on what I felt God wanted from me. And I just hope and pray that what we've done has not all been in vain. We've all been there, Bertrand. There are some truths that will only be revealed to us in death. Our only hope is that we have followed our conscience to the best of our abilities and that we will be forgiven for the times we have failed. These thoughts I share are for you alone. At this juncture, I cannot show fear, I must be brave for the sake of those who will soon die with me. I should return now and pray with them. I understand. And may our loving God be merciful. They're coming! They won't harm you. Lord Hughes has given his word. They only want the Cathar heretics. But how will they know who's a heretic? Won't they just kill us all like they did in Beziers? No, we will be spared, but you must submit to the clergy and pledge loyalty to the Pope. Those that refuse will be taken and executed. Esclarmonde was given the Consolamentum with her husband, Jean, when he passed away. Don't tell them! Just do what they ask. No Father. I just want to be with Jean. There's nothing left for me now. All I see is pain and suffering. But your mother and I, we love you so much. You and your sisters are all we have now. I forbid it. I love you both, you know that, but my heart is with my husband. We will be in a better place. The world has become so evil. Greetings, Lord Raymond. As agreed, I'm here to accept your formal surrender of Montsegur. It is with deep regret that we meet under such hostile circumstances considering our common nobility. Perhaps. Things may have turned out differently if you had been more careful choosing your allies. I only ask that you to treat my family with respect. I will do what I can. The church rules in these matters. My friend Bertrand and his followers have harmed no one. I implore you to treat them mercifully and with dignity. Raymond, their fate is not mine to choose. I'm only a poor soldier serving King Louis and the Pope. Bishop Petrus will deal with their heresies. It is now in the hands of God. Indeed it is. Those that have chosen to turn their back on our one true and loving God will burn for their sins. With such a loving, caring God, is there no chance of mercy? I am not without mercy. Those that seek forgiveness shall be spared, but only if they pledge allegiance the one and true God's church in Rome. I would rather burn than consort with the Devil. And burn you will. Take him away. The Pope has granted me new powers of the Inquisition. My brethren will now gather to prepare to hold court and hear the confessions. I will have my family gather their belongings and we will leave as agreed to, in our treaty. Your castle and lands are all forfeited to the Pope. Where do you plan to go? We will seek sanctuary in Toulouse. Good. You can inform the Lord of Toulouse about the consequences of being disobedient to the church. How can you call yourself a man of God? I could never submit to your authority. You disgust me! She does not mean that. She is hysterical after the death of her husband. Her impudence and blasphemy are no excuse. Guard, take her to face the Inquisition. I have nothing to hide. I have received the Consolamentum. Then you will burn with the others. Take her! No! You can't! She's my baby. Please, take me instead. Take them both and burn them! And take the other daughter to face the Inquisition. We shall get to the truth behind all this. Stop! This is not what we agreed to! Do you have no honor! Spare my family! It is God's will. I have spoken. I am sorry, this is not what I wanted, but my hands are tied. Burn! Burn! Burn in hell! At times, it seems Friar Tomas enjoys his work just a little too much. Give me some wine. It seems as though Friar Tomas has tripped and fallen into the fire. Most unfortunate. I believe he was your best inquisitor. Yes, Friar Tomas enjoyed his work. He could get a confession out of anyone. Unfortunately, he was also very clumsy. God works in mysterious ways. Wine? Indeed he does. Excuse me, your Grace, but I believe my work here is done. Drop your weapons! Simon! Quick! He's wounded. What happened? He's losing a lot of blood. We need to stop it. Help me, help me before he bleeds to death. Let him rest. Meg told me that you saw the amulet. It's obvious from your reaction you know what it is. I've been helping Guillaume search for the Magdala Rose ever since he told me about it. It's described in a manuscript found in the Holy Land. Why did Meg have it? I thought it would be safer with her. No one would expect a child to have it. I'm surprised that Bertrand ever trusted you with it. The Cathars only had the writings of Mary, and knew of my connection to her. They were never aware I had the amulet. What connection? I am the only surviving descendant of Mary. I was told by my mother that Mary Magdalene wore the Rose amulet at the crucifixion of Jesus. And that it had his blood on it. What about Meg? I thought you two were related. No. I was just living with her family at the time of the attack. They were helping me to hide from the Catholic persecution. How does the book fit into all this? I don't know yet. I haven't had much of an opportunity to study it more closely. However, I did find a drawing of the Rose along with a short quote from the teachings of Moses. What did it say? Did it mention the treasure? No. No, it just said that the life was in the blood. I'm not sure if it's significant. Nothing about any treasure. Simon. Wait here. My dear friend, it looks like my journey is almost over. There is no longer any place left for intrigue or deception. Is there anything I can do? Anything at all? Don't waste your life pursuing myths and fables. Life is short. I hope you discover what you need to know. Maybe one day you will find your treasure. I seek no treasure, my lord. My only desire was to find answers as to why this small relic is so important people would kill for it. So you have had it this the whole time? It's just an old amulet, it's nothing really. That and a book full of confusing riddles. No treasures, just a lot of senseless killing and greed. God is greater than all that, his spirit lives in all of us. If God was truly with us, he wouldn't let you die. He would know my prayers. What is happening? It all makes sense now. The blood of Jesus. The life is in the blood. You look much better. I feel like I've slept for a week. Is there any food left? Very little. We should probably move on. The mercenaries will be disbanding and I expect that the soldiers will moving back to Carcassonne. Well, then we head west. We will take the girls there. They will be safe at one of the nunneries. Now that we have the Magdala Rose and the book, we can then decipher the Scrolls of the Temple. While you've been asleep, I've been reading. There's no mention of any treasure. And there's no way you're going to dump me and Meg in a nunnery while you go off on your Templar quest. We must find the grail before the others do. It is the most powerful of all relics. The grail is just a legend. No, it exists and the Rose is the key to finding it. Then we'll find it together.
