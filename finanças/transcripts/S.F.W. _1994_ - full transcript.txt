SPAB: Some people might think the moral of my story is, "In this fucked-up world, "even a simple thing like buying a six-pack "can be harmful to your health." But I don't know about that. What I do know is that instead of getting our beer, Joe and me got some fucked-up terrorists sticking a video camera in our faces for 36 days and 36 nights. What we didn't know was that everybody in America was watching. [DOOR CLOSING] [TV TURNS ON] Hi there. Cliff Spab, as seen on TV. I'm Wendy Pfister. Welcome to our humble home. Come on in, take a seat. We got apple pie in the oven, and me and Joe are playing crazy eights. Hey, we can deal you in if you want. I like go fish. SPAB: Wendy, what's for dinner? Um, there's some Casa Blanca, um, red-hot bean and beef burritos and... [SPAB COUGHS] And some Pringles, some cupcakes and a bag of gumnuts and... No, you ate the last bag of gumnuts. [SPAB COUGHING] No, I didn't. You ate the last bag of gumnuts. No, I didn't, Joe! All right, you two, cut it out! No, I didn't! You fucking bitch, you ate the last bag of fucking gumnuts! I'm not a fucking bitch, I'm sick of you calling me a fucking bitch! Wendy, Wendy, Wendy! I'm sick of it! Let the dog in. Joe, you take out the trash! Fuck the dog! Fuck the trash! No more backtalk from you, young man, or you can forget dessert! Jesus Christ! When I was a young boy, I wouldn't even think of talking the way you kids do. This is my house.

[CLEARS THROAT] Wendy. Spab. Hey, Wendy, Spab? How about another beer? [CLEARS THROAT] That's the last one, Joe. Well, we'll just have to get some more, then. No, I mean, really, that's the last one.

For 36 days, American television was forced to broadcast uncensored video tapes of five individuals held by a terrorist group, Split Image. If the uncensored tapes weren't aired, all five hostages would die. A threat Split Image made good with the brutal killings of Kim Martin and Milt Morris. And so, every night on prime-time television, we watched with agonized fascination as the hostages, five ordinary Americans, were transformed from convenience-store shoppers into national heroes. What the ultimate goal of Split Image was, we may never know. Any further insight may have to await the recovery of the young man we came to know so well, Cliff Spab. At this moment, young Mr. Spab is in a tightly guarded hospital room, recovering from the bullet wound he suffered while risking his own life to save the only other surviving hostage, Wendy Pfister. We hope to have Cliff as our guest as soon as his health permits. How are you, Cliff? How the hell does he look? Listen, kid, you think you're up to a press conference? Cliff, the President wants to give you a medal. The President.We're talking big time. At the White House. Yes, sir, we finally hit the jackpot! In the Rose Garden. Look, kid, all that stuff I said about you being a loser? Well, forget it. Cliff, your father has something very exciting he wants to tell you. Go ahead, Bob, tell him. Well, Son, it's just that your mom and me, we... Just spit it out, Bob! They're making a TV movie all about you. The Cliff Spab Story, just the way it happened. Actually, they're making three TV movies. But our version is the authorized one. The real McCoy. And check this out. I know how you feel. You don't have to talk if you don't want to. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Sometimes it feels better to talk about it. Of course, sometimes, it feels better not to talk about it. Agent Parsley. FBI. You might have fooled the rest of the world, but you don't fool me. I'm betting you were in on this little stunt. You're nothing but a foul-mouthed, lazy, good-for-nothing, little prick hoodlum. And the world would best be rid of you. The dark side of the Pepsi generation. That is you, all the way. They're offering you $1 million. We're talking seven figures. That is a lot of money. We loved the way you handled yourself on that TV special. Very smooth. He doesn't know about the TV special. You don't know about the TV special? Cliff, you had your own TV special. Don't worry about it, Cliff. You were sensational! The best! Highest TVQ ever. Better than a real star. The Cliff Spab Special. It got a 30 share. Even better than The Wendy Special. Ultimately, it's really up to me. I haven't really found anybody that can really help me out. It's hard, because I don't think people really understand what I'm all about. You think there'll be a time when you will want to look to the future, and you will want to start to look, see if things are gonna be brighter for you? I really don't know. [PHONE RINGING] Hello.

He's a lazy, foul-mouthed, uneducated drug addict. [AUDIENCE EXCLAIMS] [LAUGHING] This guy's funny. Wendy, you met Cliff Spab at the Fun Stop. He's from working-class Madison Heights. You're from the wealthy suburb of Ozell Park. Bottom line, you and Cliff are very different people, aren't you? In what ways? I really don't think we're all that different. [LAUGHING] Wendy looks good! Mmm-hmm. I'd do her. But you're perceived differently. Well, that's what this is all about anyway, isn't it? Perceptions. I mean, I don't think people know Spab any more than they know me. Did you fuck her? I mean, with the handcuffs and everything? All right, shut the fuck up, Morrow. WENDY: They may think they know the two of us, but they don't know us at all. HOST: Okay, Wendy, I gotta ask you this. Where is Cliff Spab? I know! I know! I know! Here! HOST: Indeed, all of America is wondering, where is Cliff Spab? Where can he be? Is he on the road or has foul play befallen him? [AUDIENCE CLAPPING] Hang on. Hang on. If I was Wendy and I knew where Spab is, I would never tell anybody. Wendy? [AUDIENCE CLAPPING] Initially no network would air the hostage tapes. But after the cold-blooded executions of hostages Kim Martin and Milt Morris, the networks had no choice. And all over the world, every night, Cliff Spab and Wendy Pfister became part of our lives.

MALE TV HOST: Wendy Pfister, the courageous young woman we came to care about so deeply, has been through more in the last several months than most of us will experience in a lifetime. But through it all she has retained her dignity, refusing to be reduced to the level of her mysterious captors. And when she emerged from her terrible ordeal, she found herself strengthened. She discovered an iron will and a newfound sensitivity to the needs of others. In short, Wendy Pfister has been transformed from a typical American teenager into a genuine American heroine. Tonight, for the first time, we'll get to spend an hour with Wendy, in the privacy of her own home. What about Cliff Spab? What are your impressions of him? Her hair is terrible. I think she looks good. Really? I've been really careful with what I say about Spab. Why? Because people don't understand him. And you have to know him to really know what he's all about. Would you like to see Spab again? Could you be friends? I think we still are friends. Sure, I'd like to know how he's doing. You don't spend that much time with somebody and not find out practically everything about each other's lives. I really miss him. He saved my life. That girl is cracking up. I personally don't think she's getting very good advice. Really? And what advice would you give her? Well, first of all, I would tell her to relax. And then I would advise her to have some fun. And then I would tell her to laugh all the way to the bank. Well, here it is. Wow! Okay, I'm going to commit a little felony here. How's your pitching arm, Spab? [SNIFFLING] [BREATHING DEEPLY] Who are you, Clifford Spab? Uh, just some greasy-ass white boy from the northeast suburbs. Hello! Well, it's sure been an interesting night. The night's still young, and so are you. [LAUGHS] If you need a place to lay low, I'll protect your privacy. Thank you. But when you're ready, I'll be ready with you. Oh, that's great. Ready, um... Ready for what? Well, I mean, one of these days you're gonna want to get your life back and you may have to sue some people to get it. Well, they can all just fuck themselves. [LAUGHS] Well, we all would like that, Spab, but experience has taught me that people just don't up and fuck themselves. They need somebody else to fuck them. Mmm-hmm. And that's why God created lawyers... Huh. ...like me. And that's why Morrow brought you here. This was Morrow's idea? I mean, you guys are gonna split the profits, right? Actually we'll only split 50%. The other 50 goes to you. Oh, right. [SIGHS] Where are you going? Come on, Spab, it's a total spinout. You need to take control. [WHISTLING] Spab, I'm willing to negotiate. You little fucker! Shit. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [CAR APPROACHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] EARL: It is Spab! [LAUGHING] DOLLY: Is it Spab? [BOTH SHOUTING] Hey... [LAUGHS] Fucking Spab! Fucking A, man! I'll tell you something, Spab. You sure as hell said some shit that needed fucking said! Well, thank you, Dolly. Heard that! Thank you, Earl. I'm just saying, and this is just me saying it, but I just think that you said a whole lot of shit that a lot of people in this country think about, but don't have the fucking guts to say out loud. I'm gonna go even further and say they don't even have the fucking guts to think about it. [EARL WHOOPING] Heard that! Hey, give me a hit. [ALL SINGING UNINTELLIGIBLY] SPAB: Where'd that joint go? Where'd that joint go? Oh, thank you, honey. Thank you. I want to ask you something, baby. Did you ever think you were gonna bite it back there? Well, let me put it this way, sweetheart. EARL: I heard that. Heard that. What it boils down to, is that I'm a survivor, okay? Amen. That's what it is. And anybody who thinks I'm gonna live fast and die young, Earl, well, they don't know me now, do they? [LAUGHING] [ALL CHATTERING] [DOLLY SCREAMING] MALE ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program to bring you a special report. The Madison Heights Police have issued an All Points Bulletin for the arrest of Cliff Spab. Spab is wanted for assault and battery on a local teenager at the Crestridge Mall. If you have any information as to Cliff Spab's whereabouts, please contact the Madison Heights police department immediately. Now back to our regular programs. Fucking liars! Fuck 'em, fucking, fucking liars! Don't sweat it, Spab. We got it covered. Whoa! There ain't no fucking way they're getting you without a fight, baby. Okay, Earl, Earl, let's just put the gun down, okay, buddy? Let's just put it over there. We don't need to go this far now, do we, guys? DOLLY: Spab, man, forget about it. Forget about it, all right? You showed us the way. You opened the door. Earl? I say the motherfucking Madison Heights pigs shouldn't be allowed to get away with this kind of shit, man. [DOLLY LAUGHING] I say there's no way that our Spab should be treated with this kind of disrespect. [LAUGHING] DOLLY: Spab, you're a fucking hero. You saved Wendy Pfister's life. I say fuck kinder-gentler, that's what else I say. ♪ It's payback time in America ♪ God shed his grace on thee Motherfucker. ♪ And crown thy good ALL: ♪ With brotherhood ♪ From sea to shining sea [CAR BACKFIRES] [ALL CONTINUE SINGING] EARL: How the hell is it my fault? You were driving the whole damn time. Exactly. So why the fuck should I be paying attention to shit like that? You're supposed to be the copilot, Earl. EARL: So, watching the gas thing is the copilot's responsibility now, huh? DOLLY: Yeah, you know it. Give me a fuckin' break. You know it. I got to be dealing with... [BIRDS CHIRPING] SPAB: Everyone wanted a piece of me. The only problem was, there wasn't enough of me to go around. I guess Janet was right. I mean, this whole thing was like a circle spinning out of control. First, you get sucked in, then you get spun out. I was somewhere between getting sucked and getting spun. Actually, the whole thing sucked. If Joe was alive, he'd be laughing his ass off and telling everyone to fuck off at the same time. Joe was never subtle. Me, I had no idea what I was gonna do. The only thing I knew for sure was that road trips aren't all they're cracked up to be. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Hi there. How may I help you? Well, Pamela, I'd like a room. The only thing available tonight is a suite. Fine, that'll be just fine. All right. And your name? Robert Plant. SPAB: Hi there. Cliff Spab for Bayer Aspirin. Wendy Pfister, which do you think Joe Dice will prefer? Microwave stuffing or your potatoes lyonnaise? Oh, Joe would definitely prefer the potatoes lyonnaise. They're his favorite. Well, then, Joe, which is it gonna be? Wait, what are my choices again? Wendy's stuffing. WENDY: Or Wendy's potatoes lyonnaise. I definitely prefer Wendy's[BEEP] . WENDY: Ooh. Joe Dice, a man so mean he shot a guy for snoring too loud. [BEEP] Hi there! Hi there! Do you know me? I like shopping so much, I've been in the same[BEEP] store, for Christ knows how long. That's why I carry the American Express card. And if you go shopping in Madison Heights, don't forget your Visa card and don't forget your ammunition. All right. [BEEP] I got one more thing to say. Remember this. I'm not a hostage. I just play one on TV. Atta boy! That's Remington! ♪ Jesus Christ pose ♪ Arms held out ♪ Like it's the coming of the Lord ♪ And would it pay you more to walk on water ♪ Than to wear a crown of thorns ♪ WOMAN: ...coming from?

You know, his final words, man, I ain't never gonna forget them, goes, "So[BEEP] what?" I mean, the thought of that just sends chills right down to my spine. WOMAN: Okay, now, this is still an unconfirmed report. Authorities in Madison Heights have reason to believe that the body recovered earlier this evening, in a motel parking lot, is indeed that of Cliff Spab. An apparent suicide at the age of 20. We'll all miss you, Cliff. [REMOTE CONTROL CLICKING] [LAUGHS] [RINGING TONE] WOMAN 1: TVM. How may I direct your call? Hi there. Got a hot news scoop for you. Let me talk to somebody. One moment, please. WOMAN 2: TVM news desk, can I help you? Yeah. Cliff Spab ain't dead. He's alive and well, and I can prove it. Are you talking about the Cliff Spab? Uh-huh. Really?

Over here is Peggy, Grace and Dottie over there. Let's wave to the camera, girls, huh? So, anyway, really, you get down to it, you know, when they first asked me to be a guest VJ here on TVM they said I could talk about anything I want. As long as I didn't use words like[BEEPING] . [WENDY LAUGHS] And especially not words like mother[BEEP] . So I made a promise to them, you know, not to use words like... [BEEPING] And especially not any words like mother[BEEP] . So, anyway, I decided to play my 10 most favorite videos, where they either sing about[BEEP] , show[BEEP] or use [BEEP] in the title. "So[BEEP] what?" The clip you just saw is based, I do believe, on the personal experiences of yours truly. But before we go to that next clip, see you in a minute, girls, I'd like to share something kind of special with you all. I'd like to dedicate this to a very close friend, who I haven't seen in way too long. Wendy, if you're out there, this Bull's for you. [ALL CHEERING] All right. All right. Shut the fuck up! Time out, time out, time out, guys. Look, everybody keep quiet, so you can hear what Spab has to say, okay? Okay, Spab is ready for your questions. REPORTERS: Mr. Spab, Mr. Spab, Mr. Spab, Mr. Spab. Mr. Spab, how do you explain the behavior on those tapes? And why do you suppose that Split Image made those tapes? You know, I don't know. I never figured out what the pantyhose guys wanted. I guess they were just bored shitless, like the rest of us. Maybe they were just trying to get through it, you know. We didn't know the fucking world was watching. [ALL TALKING] Could you describe for us, the situation that led to your escape from the Fun Stop? Yeah, we ran out of beer. [ALL CHEERING] Liked that one, huh? Mr. Spab? Mr. Spab, do you consider yourself an alcoholic? I don't have to consider myself nothing with all you reporters doing it for me. Mr. Spab, exactly what is it that you're rebelling against? Well, that depends, what you got, huh? [ALL CHEERING] Mr. Spab? Mr. Spab, I would like to know why you can't be a little more serious in your answers? Hey, look, this is the way I am, okay? Don't be taking me so fucking seriously. Mr. Spab, what can you say about Joe Dice? Well, there's nothing to say about Joe, is there? He's gone. I miss him. Do you think he will care that I'm wearing a Free Cliff Spab shirt? He'll love it. You look great. He'll be glad to see you. Hey! Hey! Trippy legs! How you doing, bro? Whoa! Look at that big bottle of beer you got there. I'm a big guy. Kristen, this is Clifford. Clifford, Kristen. Hi. Hi. Let's go. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. How's everybody doing? I knew that dead guy wasn't you. Didn't I say? Yeah. It's too bad though. Your school papers and shit would've gone for twice the fucking cash, bro. [STUTTERS] Excuse me, you're Cliff Spab. Yeah, that's right. He ain't Patty Hearst, buddy, huh? He saved Wendy Pfister's life. Oh, we know, we saw it. That was something. Who do I have the pleasure of meeting? Oh, I'm Phil Connors, oh, and this is my wife, Rita. Hi, Rita. Hi, how nice to meet you. What do you say we take these guys hostage with us, huh? BOTH: Yeah! Come on, come on, Phil, Rita, come party with us! No, no, we're supposed to meet some people. ALL: Aw! What do you say, Rita? So fucking what! [ALL CHEERING] Let's party! Come on, Phil! KRISTEN: Party down! Yeah, here it is. Oh, wow. This is class. This is great. What'd I tell you, huh? Yeah. Over here. Whoo-hoo. Hey, Cliff, does this go in the bathtub? The beer ball goes at the bar, right there. Oh, we got a bar. Hey, Scott, tell Spab about the concert. What concert is that? Clifford, you want to see Spiral Jet, Friday night? They want you to introduce them. Yes, I do! Cool! Rita, where are you? How about a beer? You want a Bullseye or a Heineken? Uh, Heineken. Yeah, you look like a Heinie kinda girl to me. I hope that's good. Oh, that is good. You want a beer?No. Come on. SCOTT: Hey, Clifford, you know, Kristen there is your biggest fan. Oh, yeah?Yeah. But it's not like I want to fuck you or anything. I think we should go. No, sweetheart, let's just stay a little longer. You got to live to learn, Phil. You got to live to learn. Now, who said that? Being your brother has made me real popular with the ladies. Oh, that's great, Scott. I'm glad it's finally working for you. I just want to hang around, you know, hear what you gotta say. Mmm, well, I don't know shit. [SIGHS] See, that is so Spab. [LAUGHING] That is Spab. That is Spab, you're right. That is Spab. Tsk. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Cliff Spab. [CROWD CHEERING] [HOOTING] Yeah! Thank you! [AUDIENCE CHANTING] Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. [WHISTLING] Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. Spab. [CHANTING CONTINUES] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [YELLING] [CROWD CHANTING] No! No! [SCREAMING] No! [SCREAMING] [ELECTRICITY SURGING] CROWD: Spab! Spab! Spab! [WENDY SOBBING] [SCREAMING] [CHANTING CONTINUES] [WHISTLING] [ALL CHEERING] Hey, Wendy. Hi, Spab. This is it. Where are you supposed to go buy a beer now, huh? I heard they want to tear this down and then turn the whole place into a memorial park. God damn it! Is that what it all boils down to? A fucking memorial park? That's one way to live forever. I'd like to live forever, but only for a little while. Spab, you are so full of shit. You know, you try to come off as just some guy. But you're not just some guy. You've got a message. Yeah? What's my message? Your message is that there is no message. Nothing really matters. The message is, "So fucking what." You keep saying it, but nobody really hears you. Well, I'm sorry to break the bad news to you, Wendy. I'm full of shit. There are plenty of things that matter to me in this world. Yeah, like what? Like you. WENDY: There's something I keep thinking about. SPAB: Hmm? Maybe even trying to explain what happened in the store is just pointless, you know. I mean, how do you explain something like that to somebody? You can't. There is one way. You could lock them in a room for 36 days. They might understand then. You have to let them watch some people die. Yeah. Fuck it. Let's face it, Spab, we have this little understanding. Nobody else knows what it's all about. It's like a disease. Madison Heights Syndrome. Madison Heights Syndrome. If you don't have it, you can never understand it. Spab. Let's not even bother trying to explain it to anybody else. If you weren't in that store with us... You can shut the fuck up right now. You know, maybe Spab thought things would be the same way they always were. I mean, I know I thought once I got out of there, I'd just be going back to Ozell Park High on Monday morning. Things have just been really weird since getting out of that store. If you think about it enough, you can go nuts. That's one of Spab's favorite lines, by the way. Anyway, anyway, I guess I've talked enough, so it's time to meet the guy that made all this possible, Mr. "So fucking what" himself, Cliff Spab. [ALL CHEERING] Thank you. Thank you. ALL: So fucking what! So fucking what! So fucking what! So fucking what! Okay. So fucking what! So fucking what! So fucking what! SPAB: Standing out there on the stage of Madison Heights High, I was suddenly knocked on my ass with this strange sort of feeling. It wasn't just the cheering. I wasn't really sure what it was. So I just stood there looking stupid for what seemed like a long time trying to figure it all out. There was nothing I could do, except wait for the chanting to die down. But the noise only grew louder and louder. [CHANTING CONTINUES] Everything matters! FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Wendy Pfister and Cliff Spab were shot this morning at a Madison Heights high school assembly. Witnesses say Spab had just stepped up to the microphone, when three shots rang out. Pfister was standing nearby. After witnessing the shooting, hundreds of grief-stricken students refused to return to class, leaving the campus a virtual ghost town. Madison Heights high school senior, Barbara "Babs" Wyler, was arraigned in court today in connection with the shooting of Wendy Pfister and Cliff Spab. FEMALE REPORTER: Why did you fire the first shot? BARBARA: Everything matters. [REPORTERS CHATTERING] Are you a friend of Cliff Spab? FEMALE NEWSCASTER: ...to take total responsibility for everything they say, do and feel. Babs Wyler was a perpetrator of violence and a dangerous reactionary. The American people can rest assured that all the resources of this office will be used to make sure that Babs Wyler... ...the national scholastic merit award for her essay, "Everything Matters". It's about a new generation of young people who take total responsibility for everything they say, do and feel. This is about the first amendment. What Babs did was an act of symbolic free speech. Now the issue here is whether we should punish a brilliant, gifted young woman for bringing the message of responsibility, hope and optimism to the world? I don't think so. ...outside Madison Heights county jail, where dozens of protesters are staging an all-night vigil... MALE REPORTER: Day after day, we have watched with fascination, a straight-A student, Barbara "Babs" Wyler, an anything but ordinary young American has been catapulted from suburban obscurity to international fame. Tonight, in a live interview from Madison Heights county jail, we will learn all about Babs' philosophy for a new age, a philosophy in which everything matters. Those are the words of Barbara "Babs" Wyler, the courageous young woman we have come to care about so deeply. Babs has been through more in the past few weeks than most of us will experience in a lifetime. But through it all she has retained her dignity, refusing to be reduced to the level of her detractors. When she emerged from her terrible ordeal, she found herself strengthened and her "Everything Matters" philosophy intact. In short, Babs Wyler has been transformed from a typical American teenager into an atypical American phenomenon. Tonight, for the first time, we'll get to spend an hour with Babs in the privacy of her own home. Babs, what are your impressions of Cliff Spab? I must be very careful of what I say about Cliff Spab. But why? Because... [MONITOR BEEPING] Hey, Wendy. Spab. Wendy. Spab. Wendy. Spab. How about another beer? How about a bag of gumnuts? How about a stale burrito? How about some 3-in-1 oil for your folding chair? How about a bath in the sink? How about a song? Hey, Wendy. Spab. Wendy. Spab. Wendy. Spab. We're getting married or what?
