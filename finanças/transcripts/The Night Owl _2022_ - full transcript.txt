Thank you. Did you prepare a lot for the exam? I have to quit drinking or I can't. If you go into the palace and get married, you'll fix your life. I heard you're going to hire a drunkard this time. You know the guy who went into the palace last year? He bought a house. How much is it? It's a big deal. Oh, I'm going to be nice to the crown prince. Why? Are you going to take the exam? Yes, I can see it. Yeah, Kyungsoo should fix his life now. Of course, Kyungsoo should fix his life. Hurry up and finish it and get ready to get a five-month-old. Oh, yes, yes. Oh, he's here. He's here. He's Lee Hyung-ik from the palace. The irregularity of the pulse seems to have a problem. You need more oxygen? If you don't do the test right away, it will be difficult to get through today. Do the test right away. This thread is not the thread I usually use. I think it's more of a problem of the mind than the body. Hey, let's take a look at the body. I've seen enough. It seems to be wind. It's not safe. Is it a small dog? What do you do with that? I heard footsteps earlier, and I was limping. The short and irregular breathing interval seems to be a short temper and lack of patience, so it seems to be blowing. Can you do that without even having a diagnosis? It's all nonsense to diagnose with a thread in the first place. Writing a poem is just a premeditation from the aspect that can't diagnose the inner-body. In fact, you will have to diagnose through a conversation with a patient. If it were you, where would you be? Hey, did I tell you not to run? You're a good kid. You're a good kid. You're so good at everything. Kyungsoo, you're so lucky. I knew it would work out someday. Don't work so hard. Eat. When a person lives honestly, good things happen. Here you go. One. What's wrong? No, it's not. Thank you. Why do you always stay still? Everything will be fine as long as you become a mother. It's good, right? Yeah. When you go to the palace, you can buy a house and fix your financial problems. Everything will be fine. Kyung-jae, if you go to the palace this time, you can't come out for a while. Why? How much? If you go to the palace for the first time, you'll learn a lot, so you'll be out after a month. Instead, you can go around the house after a month. You told me to dig up the grass when I went to the mountain to dig up the grass. Hey, that's a grass digger. You said you wanted to eat that, so you're going to dig it up. Did you enjoy it or not? Young-ju, are you okay? You bastard! If you go in there and get a beating, you can pay for everything you've been pushed for. Just wait for the arrival. What are you talking about? You know that if you don't have a heart, you'll die. You've been pushed so far, but you don't have a conscience. You have to take your medicine without me. I have no one without you. Why don't you have me? Sweet sleep, sweet sleep. Hey, Hong Hyesung! You pretend you didn't hear or see anything! Oh, you don't care, do you? Anyway, you should always be careful. You know I'm handsome. So that you can understand, I'm a little bit of a woman's type. But isn't the other side of the military? Yes, this is the new shortcut. This way. If you think you have to answer, just say yes. In the palace, there are roads that we can walk on. There are roads that we can't walk on. So you have to stay alert. Especially the inner palace. You can't even talk in the inner palace. Now, be careful. This is the inner palace. Over there is the medicine room. And over there is the storage room. You can't see, right? Come this way. Here. Here. Here. Here. Sit here. That's right. That's right. Sit here for a while. I'll bring you your clothes. How dare you touch my stuff as soon as you came in? You don't even know what this is Be gentle, gentle You're touching the poison without permission Do you think I touched it because I knew it was poison? I'll give you a hard time, so let's move on this time That little rat is so stubborn. Sit down, sit down. Sit down, sit down. The inner court is a place that deals with human life, so the hierarchy is fierce. But why is there poison in the inner court? How can I make it with chemicals? Oh, my. Eat, eat, eat. You know you have to write a check every two days, right? I'm not sleepy, so I'll help you for the first few days. Don't worry too much. If you're sleepy, go to sleep I can't sleep while I'm on duty I'm going to read a book over there Oh, you don't need a light, do you? I'll turn off all the lights. You're so quick-witted. Gyeongje, it's still very cold at night, but how are you doing? It's only been a day, but it feels like it's been a full moon. The people of my hospital are all kind and good people. It's comfortable and nice to stay with Samchi's meat side dish. Hey, Jin Chang. Put all the drugs here, okay? Hey, how can you do this to So-kyung? That's why I'm making you do it. If you wait for me, I'll buy you something delicious. So you have to take your medicine and stay healthy. Why are you so excited? What are you excited about? There are only a few days left. The day the crown prince will come. It's been 8 years since the crown prince was taken to the Qing Dynasty. The crown prince was taken to the Qing Dynasty and the queen couldn't even see her parents alone. That disease at that young age. Pyeongyang. It's a secret only the people of the palace know. The Queen Mother can't cover her urine until she's over 10 years old. You must never tell anyone. Yes. Your Majesty So-yong has a severe stomachache. Your Majesty So-yong, I'll call the maid. Forget it. I have a hobby. What are you doing? I'm not going to say hello. Is this a new volunteer? Yes, your highness. Thank you. My arm is frozen and I can't digest it. I'll try it in the middle. That's right. Will it end today? You've picked a good hobby this time. I'm Hwang Song-hwa, Your Majesty. The Crown Prince's men have passed the post. I heard the Crown Prince is coming back from the palace. I guess my body is reacting first. Your body is cold because you've been over-stressed. It's best to take it easy. I'm not worried. I'm worried about my son. It's from the school across the street. Did you see everything? If you tell people that you saw me, they'll scold you. Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Did you see Her Highness? I'm So Gyeong. Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Do you really not see anything? Yes, your highness Since when? I haven't seen anything since I was born Then... Have you never seen your parents? Yes, I haven't seen anything What about the tonic? Father said he's already over the limit of the tonic It's all done If you drink it yourself, the Crown Prince will be even happier It's my hobby It's my hobby Your Majesty, the time has come to leave. Let's go! Let's go! Why isn't Ma Jung Na Eun here? If you are so loyal that you can't even greet the crown prince who has returned after 8 years, I, the king, will have to check the king's condition. Follow me. If you take one step there, your necks will fly away. The king is sick, what are you doing here? This is the king's bed. You should just mind your own business. If I can't even take care of the company of the head of the Yeomijung, I'll resign. The Crown Prince and the Cheongnara assassin have arrived. Now the world where the Qing Dynasty dominates the world has come. Since the Crown Prince came back with such a gun on his back, where could there be a deeper thing than this? Your Highness, the Crown Prince has arrived. Your Highness. You've had a hard time, son. Let's go! Welcome, Seol Gyeong-bi. Go ahead. What do you want? I want to talk to you. Go ahead. What does he want? He wants me to translate. Go ahead. Go ahead! Translate before the situation gets worse. If you think about what you did to Jim in Namsan 8 years ago... It would be right to destroy you as the King of Joseon. I'll give you the things over there as a gift. I'll organize them for you. Yes, I understand. The things over there... This is the second room... It's so pretty. It hasn't changed at all. Is there a guest? Yes. Oh, my. You startled me. We almost got in trouble. We left the Cheongnara's body in front of us and you say it's a body? The Cheongsa people speak well of Joseon. If they speak of Cheongnara, it means that they have become the owners of the country. The 8 years you've spent in Cheongnara doesn't seem like a short time. You should prepare for a new era. A new era? The name that Joseon had was ruined and now Cheongnara has become the owner of the country. Shouldn't Joseon accept the body of the late King Sok-hui and change according to the times? We must change everything. If we don't change, Joseon will die. The problem is what the King has decided. Do you know what the situation is like this year? The people of Hwanghaedo are starving. The crown prince, for the sake of Joseon, please sign the agreement. Are you telling me to drive your father out and take Yongsang? Oh, that's not possible. But it meant that you should always be prepared. What are you doing? What are you going to do now? If the road is blocked, we have to make a new road. This is the true appearance of the land where we live. People come here by boat to the border and exchange new things and books. This is Joseon. This little land. That's what they taught me. Father, the Qing Dynasty is growing day by day, accepting Western culture. Don't cling to the past and look at the future. Don't you know why I'm wearing this? Do you still have the Naman Mountain 8 years ago in your heart? No, I don't. Still. We have to follow the order. That's the way to find your and my authenticity and to reveal the future of Joseon. The order is already ruined. I saw it with my own eyes in the northern border. Father, don't pursue a false justification and accept the Qing Dynasty as a bus and a newspaper. That's the way to make Joseon work and for you. What are you talking about for me? As a bus. As a bus. We have to change it. If we can't change it, Joseon will die. Your eyes have changed Are you still sleeping because of the cough? I'm fine. Pull out a reliable doctor and keep him by your side. Treat him consistently. I heard a lot about my original hand. You took good care of the original hand. I just did what I had to do. Your Highness has been on a long journey and your body is very damaged. Can you take care of my treatment? I'm not good enough, but I'll do my best. Your Highness. Thank you. I'm your father, Cheon Bong Sa, who will help you to spit accurately. Oh, you're So Gyeong. Your Majesty, So Gyeong is better at spitting. I didn't know that. I'm looking forward to working with you, Cheon Bong Sa. Yes, mother. You're the Duke of Seosan who serves the Crown Prince. Where is the King? Yes, he has left the palace. His Majesty is coughing a lot. Follow me. Well, according to the law of the palace, I can't treat him alone. He's sick. Why does the law matter so much? Follow me. Cough, cough, cough. I heard your lung is badly damaged. Can you fix it? It's just a hobby. I think you have something to say. No, Your Majesty. Say it. You're a doctor who pretends not to have seen a patient's illness. His body is stiffened and hardened. It's because of the excessive feed, so the blood can't circulate. You need to take a load off your mind to recover your body. Open the window for me. I think I'm already coughing. Father, you must have gotten cold. Can you take a look at him? How dare a crazy man like him call the king? I beg you. Yes, In-seong. Thank you. This time, I'll do a blood test to release the clotted energy. You can see it. No, trust me. Are you trying to fool me? How dare I lie to you? You're going to lie to me until the end? I don't want to be a burden anymore. Let's go. Cough, cough, cough How did you write a letter to your brother when you couldn't see him? It's hard for you to believe me, but I know a disease that can be seen a little in bright places and a little in dark places. I deserve to die, but my sick brother dies without me. Please save me. Why did you say you couldn't see him when you could? People don't like to see the sunset. How old is your brother? He's 10 years old. You're the same age as our original hand. What would you do? Didn't you? I have a disease in my heart. What should I do to get rid of this disease? I was talking nonsense without knowing the score. Are you going to pretend you don't know and pretend you don't see? Sometimes it's better to close your eyes and live. Are you telling me to be a small dog? Do you have to live with your eyes closed for people as high as me? You have to pretend you don't know or pretend you don't see people as low as a small person to get into the palace like this. You're sick because you've seen everything so well. Seo Sang-gong, turn off the lights. It's called enlargement. You wrote the wrong letters very hard. You should know how to write properly to become a doctor. They say it's good for you to live without looking. Can I just live with my eyes closed? The more I do that, the more I have to open my eyes wide. I'm so glad you're coughing. Since there's still a little fever left, I prepared a small hot pot to cool down the fever. I guess the medical staff ran away because they were afraid of the disease. Is this the right place? Yes, it is. Mr. Choong, the Crown Prince has awarded you for your excellent physical ability. It's a very precious medicine used for the heart disease that the Blue House brought. It will be of great help to your younger brother's disease. Wow, I didn't see it that way, but it's fast, it's fast. If it goes well later, I can't pretend I don't know. I'll go home the day after tomorrow, right? Wow, you too. I'm so happy. But isn't it the crown prince who has a friendly relationship with the Qing? If only the crown prince can stand on our side, the Qing will follow our will. Oh, my son. Oh, my son. Good job. The Crown Prince has collapsed and is unconscious. Myungsoo! Myungsoo! Thumbs up if you like this video! Hit the subscribe if you want more! Sir, do you need more Myeongjucheon? Good. You have a high fever. You can rest assured now. You've had a hard time. You've had a hard time. Go to the police station and close your eyes. Did something happen between them? What's going on? Someone... ran away over that window What is it? What's going on? It's a robbery! Hurry up and get in! What is it? Sergeant Jang! Sergeant Jang! What happened? Sergeant Jang! I'll see it with my own eyes. Get out of my way! What a ridiculous thing to do. Can't you get out of the way right now? Move! It's an order. No one is allowed to enter. What a scoundrel! No, no, no. He had a symptom of scabies, so he was taken to Myeongju Village, and he was burned to death. Scabies? Yes. Fortunately, he's stable. I and the priest saw the Crown Prince sleeping, Is what you say true? Yes, sir. It's the death-wish in my will. The symptoms of the King's death are not the same as when he wrote the death-wish. Someone wrote this death-wish and poisoned the crown prince. I saw someone running away. Who did you see? Save what you saw. I was worried about the crown prince, so I went back to the Haesikyeong. I saw someone running away through the window of his palace. He ran away and hurt the Gyeongcheob. It's true. There was blood on the Gyeongcheob. Does that mean he poisoned the crown prince? Judging by the situation, the one who ran away with the wound seems to be the poisoner. Your Highness, please inform the government about this. Did you forget your promise to the government that the crown prince will inherit the next position? If you don't inform the government about the death of the king, the Wake up. Wake up. We need to find the wounded. Search the area. What happened? The world It's said to have been poisoned. But you're trying to cure that. What are you doing? Whose order is it? I'm going to kill you right now! How can I believe this? Your Majesty. That you poisoned the crown prince of Yeongi, who cherishes our Wonson so much. Your Majesty. Is there no one there? I gave poison to the princess and the crown prince. There must be poison on the tip of the needle. It's a wound I got when I went back to the palace to save the crown prince. Are you saying you gave up the small guard? I can see a little in the dark. After trying to study with these eyes, the crown prince gave it to me. Have you seen the magnifying glass that the government brought? You finally found my master. You knew I could see a little bit, but you kept it a secret. Why would I kill such a benefactor alone? Lee Young-ik poisoned the crown prince's son? Yes, your highness. I will meet the king with this letter. If you need it, I will call you. Don't get caught until then and hide well. There are still a hundred people who haven't been identified. We're looking for them one by one. Hurry. Hey. I'm from the Navy. I got tested. What's your name? I asked what your name was. What are you doing here? His Majesty has a paralysis symptom. Hurry up and go. What day is it? It's the time for the examination. Didn't you hear that His Majesty has a paralysis symptom? Yes. I will be careful and careful. Yes, Your Majesty. This is abalone soup sent from Kang Bin's mother's home. Your Majesty, you should keep your temperature as much as possible at times like this. It's a paralysis because of the weak energy. Do you want to go to the throat? I didn't mean that. I'm going to reduce the alcohol from today. I will write the crown prince's questions myself. Tell the doctor that. Yes. You're drooling well without even seeing it. Can you see it? You should drool from now on. I'm sorry, Your Majesty. Please take the crown prince's words. Yes. Are you okay? You have to wake up at times like this. You have to think about the original. What's this? This is the letter the witness gave me. Witness? What do you mean? The person who saw Lee Young-ik is not a reader, but a witness. Kang Bin, what are you talking about? Actually, this guy is the one who poisoned the crown prince. He framed the witness. It's unfair. It's a treason. Wasn't this poison in that kid's head mine? What are you doing? Yes. Who's the witness. Bring her here. The witness is. Mr. Oh Yeol-hee is not guilty. Oh Yeol-hee was with me. What? You do it. Okay. What's going on? Look at this. How dare you poison Seonhwa's son? What are you? Get him out of here right now! Look at this. This evil woman is trying to poison her own son. I'll get you punished. How can you do that to your son? I'll get you punished. How can you do that to your son? How can you do that? I'll get you punished. We need to inform the court of the death of the Crown Prince. Can you get rid of Gangbin's accusation just because you're informing the court? We need to find out who did it. Who did it? It's Cho Young-cho. We need to get rid of Gangbin's accusation and catch Cho Young-cho. We need to have a witness. A witness. A witness? A witness? You said you could do it. That's why you even gathered the eyes of a blind man. What are you doing? Be nice. How far did you see the witness? What if he speaks? Tell me. Tell me. I can hear you. If you talk like that, I can hear you from the front door. I can hear you from the front door. Speak quietly. What are you doing? If people see you with me, they'll doubt me. If you have anything to say, I'll tell you in the car. If you have anything to say, I'll tell you in the car. But did you burn all the books I sent you? Yes, Your Highness. You're not going to collect them and threaten me later, are you? How could I do that? If this goes wrong, you'll be caught and your children will be Go find the Grand Prince. What? What do you mean? You're so ridiculous. Stand up. Come here. The doctor is here. Tell him that the doctor saw everything. Sir! Sir! The king of the Seosan palace is in danger. Please save him! Is there anyone there? There is no one. Please save him. Please! Okay, okay. You go first. I'll follow you soon. You go first. I'll follow you soon. You... My Lord... You were the one who killed the Crown Prince! The King of Joseon, because of you! You saw everything and lied to me! What's there? Did you see it all? I heard it so clearly. What did you see? What did you see? Lee Hyung Ik poisoned the crown prince. The one who ordered the poisoning is the crown prince. It's a lie! I should ask Grandfather right now. No, you can't. It's a lie, Your Majesty. Even the Empress Dowager is in danger. Grandfather killed my father! That can't be true. Your Majesty, if you go to the crown prince like this, both the Empress Dowager and the Empress will die. Grandfather! What the crown prince said is all a lie. Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather! I was trapped in a corner when I found out about this. You saw everything. Why didn't you tell me? Let's go. Let's go. I didn't tell you what you saw, so my mom and dad are in jail. It's all because of me. There's a sick brother. If I tell you what I saw, my brother will die. You have to pretend you didn't see anything miserable like us to live. I closed my eyes and came all the way here, ma'am. My dad, who I met after 10 years, is also in jail. My mom and dad are also in jail. Now I have no one. I've never seen my mother's face before. Didn't you say that, too? It's what the king of this country abandoned. What do you want me to do? What should I do now? The king is the culprit, so I can't take the king. Wait a minute. If it's you, Who would believe that you saw it? There's no winner. But you're going to survive. Is there anywhere to hide? You're going to take the throne. I'm sure he gave and received something. Wait a minute. I think I saw something. My father said that my mother was poisoned by the spirit. That So-kyung definitely said that. So-kyung. This is the secret document that the Chief sent to Lee Young-ik. This is not the Chief's handwriting. No, it's not. It's the handwriting of Grandmother. Grandmother. Why can't I write like this? Try it. Isn't it so bad down there? Hey, didn't you write it with your left hand? It's the handwriting I wrote with my left hand. I definitely saw it. This can't be a witness. Isn't this letter written by Grandmother a witness? Isn't there no way to prove that this handwriting is Joo-sung's? If Joo-sung has a handwriting written with his left hand in front of people, he won't know. I can paralyze the right hand of the Lord. Do you know what that means? Guana is not a disease that can be easily cured with a single stroke. The paralysis symptoms will have increased by now. I can paralyze the right hand of the enemy I'm attacking. Whatever excuse you give, please make the Lord write with his left hand. I'm going to have to gather my own soldiers and make a truce. I'm just a messenger. Let's trust Sogyeong and replace the king of Joseon. Why did you change your mind? It's what a suicide is. What are the doctors doing at this hour? He needs to be put on a IV drip. You didn't say that. What would you do if I told you to send him to the hospital for a IV drip? Now? If you don't get it right now, you'll get paralysis all over your body. Your Highness, I'm here to ask you to open the gate. Open the gate. What's wrong with my hand? I can't get my hand to rest. It's a natural symptom that occurs during the treatment of the wind. As time passes, it will slowly... I can't do this. Take this out. Your Majesty, if you take this out now, paralysis will spread all over your body. Take it out! If you take this out now, you may not be able to use your arms and legs for the rest of your life. Your Majesty, it's time for the sun to rise soon. Paralysis of the right hand is a natural reaction that occurs during the process of the disease. Your Majesty, you have to perform the first ritual before the sun rises. I got it. I got it. I have to take this out... I came to tell you about the transfer. He's being interrogated. Interrogated? What are you doing? Who told you to drool without permission? What? I just got a letter saying to drool. Send a letter. Who is it? Didn't you say you sent it? That guy is the poisoner who killed What's your name? I'm Kyungsoo. Kyungsoo. Just once. I'll ask you one more time. Let's go. This way! What are you talking about? 500 soldiers who are on the hunt at Hongpansae in Dosong Market have gathered. What happened to the antidote? We found out from the chief. But fortunately, the soldier ran away with the antidote. Ran away? To where? I don't know. We're supposed to meet at the main battlefield, so let's go there first. No. We might lose our lives if we trust the lieutenant. We have to get rid of the soldiers right now. This way! What's going on? It's just a dog's nest. Where would Chief go? We'll find out. Go to Byulgam who's keeping the rumor If I say I sent it, I'll let you go. What's going on? I know. It's a mess. The Crown Prince is dead. I'm so scared. Shut up. I heard the Queen Mother is sick too. That's why Lee Yeong-ui was called urgently. You son of a bitch! I'm going to kill you. Sir! Sir! Your Majesty. Your Majesty. I heard you can't see. You must have run away from home, you bastard. I've never seen you, I've never heard of you. I'm just trying to help you. Why are you getting involved in this? Give me the memorial. Who told you to do this? Did Choi Dae-gang tell you to do this? Kill me and move the memorial? Or Kang Bin. She tried to kill me and take my place by kidnapping my son. Now you're going to put this guy in my place? What did you say? You said you'd give me a position of loyalty. Tell me, who told you to do this. Who told you to kill me. Did you come all the way here to find me? Or did you come all the way here to find a place to hide? You have a good face. I can't tell what you're thinking. You don't look so good. If you come down from the throne now, I'll spare your life. I'm your king. Where does the king go? Did you forget who sat on the throne? Yes, and now you're going to sleep with the crown prince and kill me. There are martyrs outside the city of Hanyang. Who will be the king who killed his son? Martyrs, come on. Give me. Then the Orangke guys will leave you alone. What if they kill us all and build the king of Orangke? I'm not going to die. We need to join forces. How many more years will I last if I endure it? If I die, I'm your crown prince anyway. How do I know when your heart will change? But do you believe in who the crown prince is? That's what it looks like. What are you going to do with the enemy? If I let him go now, I'll set up a trap to get revenge on my father. If it's a sunset, let it be a sunset. Close your eyes and live. There is no one to kill. The crown prince died of scabies. Take the prince and treat him. I brought it. The evidence is with you, sir. I saw it for sure. The chief is trying to kill that prince. I saw it. I saw it for sure. How. How can a father kill his son. What are you listening to. Kill the one who's pulling him right now. I saw it for sure. I saw it. Didn't you hear me? Didn't you hear me? Pull him right now and surrender. I saw it. Pull him right now. What are you doing. Pull him right now. What are you doing? You saw everything, didn't you? What did my ancestor do? You're a disgrace. You're a disgrace. Look at that. Look at that. You're a disgrace. You're a disgrace. Wait here while you eat this. Here. Did you hear? The king collapsed. The king? Yes. So he's looking for a name. Oh, really? Yes. A disgrace. I called a member of the committee who said he would cause a death by drooling. I'll be on my way. Oh, you're here to kill me. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I'm sorry. Who told you to kill me. It's starting again. What do you see?
