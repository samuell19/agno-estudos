Sean, get out. Hi there. How long has this been here? Tuesday. Ten twenty-three over on Tenth and Montgomery. Detective, we got a possible 187 out on Route 59. That's south of Washington township. Detective Breslin. They're right this way. Did anybody move the body? No, but ... You got a cause of death? Officially, we haven't determined death. Sir. What the fuck is that? We thought we should call you because of your background... in oral... Forensic odontology. That's someone's real bad day. Yeah. No kidding. The victim is male, early-to-mid thirties... moderate smoker, less moderate drinker... upper middle to upper class, lives in the city... and definitely not a vegetarian. You're sure of all that? The root transparency and enamel wear... put the age at about 32, plus or minus 4. Acid rasmization will be more precise. I'm waiting on the results. You see this, right here? That is lateral striated trauma. That's where the pliers slipped. The victim, he was struggling during the extraction. He could still be alive? Yeah. Be on a liquid diet, but yeah. Come and see. It was written on four trees around the pond. North, south, east and west. Any idea what it means? Means they brought a compass. How are the kids holdin' up? Fine. I image it's been a tough week for them. Karen's birthday and all. Yeah. Why don't we get out of here? I'm almost done here. Come on, I'll walk with you. Earthling, no one can help you now. What do you want from me? What is my strength that I should hope? Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass? Wherefore then has thou brought me forth out of the womb? Wherefore then has thou brought me forth out of the womb? I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave. Are not my days few? A land of darkness, as darkness itself... and to the shadow of death... without any order... and where light is as darkness. God hath delivered me to the ungodly... and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. Jesus Christ. Is that blood? No, it's paint. She's been dead about twelve hours. I don't know how long she was hanging up there alive. How'd she get in that thing? A drug injection probably. No, that's not what I mean. It takes more than one person to do this. Make sure we get a report from footprint morphology. And then there's this. Looks like they stood right here and watched. That's a tripod. They videoed the entire thing. How many kids does she have? Three, and they're downstairs. Let me do it. I'll do it. Who found her? Her daughter. Which one? The oldest one. She's adopted. Thanks for the hot tip. Hello. I'm Detective Breslin. I'm gonna be heading up the investigation. I just wanted you girls to know we're going to do everything... Where are they? Daddy! Daddy, daddy! It's gonna be all right. You need to double-check that before we do anything with it. Yeah, will do. What's up? They took something. They took what? They took something from inside of her. She was pregnant. Detective? I didn't mean to interrupt you. No, no. lt's all right Is there anything that I can do for you? Are you going to catch the person that did this? I'm going to try. Kristin... if you need anything... if you need to talk or you have any questions at all... just call that number. Anything at all. Thank you. What have you got for me? Heavy gauge fishing hooks. Ankles, backs of knees. She had two in the back of each thigh. One behind each elbow. Three up each side of the back. And then there's this. She was stabbed in the chest with an unidentified... very sharp, very long foreign object. Punctured her lung. The object lacerated one of her bronchial arteries and the bronchus... which is one of the major air passages into the lungs. So, blood starts flowing out of the severed artery... into the severed air passage. The lungs fill. You ever accidentally drink water down your air pipe? lmagine doing it continuously for an hour. So, are we looking at a torture kill here? If it was done intentionally, yeah, we would call it torture. But it wasn't. To skewer both of those spots, in just the right way? That's basically impossible to do deliberately. They probably just wanted to bleed her out. What is that? Etomidate injection. She was drugged. Yeah. So she could be hung up by the fishhooks. I understand things I see less every year, buddy. Shit. There's the Metropolitan theatre. That's where I met your mother. I know. You tell me that every single time you pass it. Yeah. Right. Do you maybe want to go to the game tonight? What game? A friend of mine has these season tickets ... and I thought you might want to go so I gave him some money. Where did you get that kind of money, Alex?. It's from you. Every time you ditch us. Oh, yeah. Right. What game is this? The Red Wings. Red Wings. If you can't go, if you have to work or something... No, no, no-- Let's go. Why not? Sean! Yeah? Guess who's in town tonight? Who? The Red Wings. Cool. We're gonna go to the game. Yes! Yes! All right! Come on! Hi, Rose. Hi, Mr. Breslin. Have fun, guys. Go get ready. The Wings have just been a dominant team at home and on the road. Dad. Dad, look! You guys look like twins. Yeah. Bres, it's Stingray. They found another dead body. Where? Eighteenth and Broadway. We got an anonymous call. We need you down here right now. I'll be right there. It's Steven Silva. 33, single. Teaches the 2nd grade. He seems to be missing all his teeth. No, thanks. Got any prints? Fingerprints? No. Footprints? Four sets. Three watching, one doing. And the tripod, just like before, except for the windows. That's ripe. Let me have some of that. Is that paint again? Yeah. What did you find out about these rigs? These rigs aren't cheap. Heavy-duty fishing hooks. Steel-reinforced lines. Custom jobs. Tailor-made for the suspension connoisseur. Connoisseur? Suspension is a...sub-culture based on ancient rituals found in several religions. It's the next step of evolution from tattoos and piercings. All right, that's where we start. Pay a visit to every tattoo parlor in the city. We're already on it. Bres? What? Look at him. A second grade teacher. Whoever's doing this is...it's inhuman. Tuck, get the paramedics up here. How the fuck did we miss this? Sloppy fucking police work. Come on! Let's go! He's a good tenant. He pays the rent, he... Just play that, will you? What happened? What happened to the picture? Hold on. What time is that? Four o'clock AM exactly. Fuck. Just fast forward again. Okay. What time was that? Seven o'clock AM exactly. Tuck? Bres. What time of death do you have on Silva? Estimated time of death between five and six. And we got an address on that tattoo parlor. It's on the corner of Main and Tenth. Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. I'm looking for something. Suspension? Yeah, we do that. Really? Banksy! What's up? Do you know who made this? Yeah. I did. And when was that? Month, month and a half ago. So, he called you. You never saw him. No. Called me, told me what he wanted. Faxed me his schematics from a Kinko's. Did it seem strange to you? Come on, man. We got doctors, lawyers, businessmen coming here and getting stuff done. Scarification. Dermal implants. Cock stretching. Whatever. It doesn't mean they want you to know about it. How many did you make? What? How many of the suspension rigs did you make? Bro, it's fucking midnight... and I'm still at work helping you out... when I wanna be at home catching a jack to Belladonna. So cut me some slack if you want my cooperation, capiche? Oh, yeah. Maybe I should. Yeah. Or maybe I should just take you outside... and search you and your car for controlled substances. How about that? Four. I made four rigs. Thank you. Stingray, wake up. I need you to listen to me. They made four rigs. We got two victims. Oh, shit. So there's two more. What did you find out about the girl in the closet? Her name's Whitney Jacobs. She's pretty dehydrated. She's still in and out of consciousness. Thy drugged her up pretty bad. What I find most interesting was her recent divorce dates. Husband - Garrison Jacobs. They share custody of two kids... currently spending the weekend with their grandparents. Two kids? Let me guess. Garrison's got a kid in the second grade, right? Yup. Garrison Jacobs must have figured out... his wife was having one too many parent-teacher conferences. And Garrison Jacobs is currently-? Unaccounted for. Let's find him. Come and see. You shouldn't be looking at those. Come and see what? I don't know. Come and see... Sean, get away from my stuff. Revelations six. You have got to be kidding. It was ceremonial. The serving tray. The teeth. They're announcing themselves. They want us to know that they're here. Who? Revelations six. "And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him"... "had a bow, and a crown was given unto him"... "and he went forth conquering." "And when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say"... "'Come and see."' "And there went out another horse that was red." "Power was given to him to take peace from the earth"... "and there was given unto him a giant sword." Remember this? Shit. "And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say"... "'Come and see,' and I beheld the black horse" "and he that sat on it had a pair of balances in his hand." They're labeling them. The fourth is the pale horse. "And his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him." It's the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The book of Revelation is the vision of the Apostle John. A vision of the end of times as revealed to him by Jesus. The horsemen are the first four of... seven prophetic elements of the apocalypse. Okay, so there's Death who rides the pale horse. Which, in fact, is green. Pestilence rides the black horse. And the red horse is? War. Yeah. What is the difference between death and war? Think of war as more of a concept. Not as man killing man, but as strife. Death is a physicality. War is state of mind. And the rider of the white horse? The rider of the white horse is the leader. Some believe that he is the anti-Christ. Others think he is Jesus Christ himself. Aidan... these people chose the horsemen as their model for a reason. If they truly understand the symbolism of the horsemen... and it sounds like they do... you should expect things to get much worse. We're looking for a four-person team. Their intent is to produce two more victims. I intend to stop them. Suspect one is the smallest. Between 100 and 115 pounds. The other three kept clear while this one tortured Marianne Spitz. The suspect spent quite a bit of time around her head. They must have had quite a conversation. The second suspect is Garrison Jacobs. His whereabouts are unknown at this time. Suspect three delivered the killing blow in both cases. I think that he's the pale horse Death. Why? Because the fourth suspect is the only one in both locations... who never moved. Not an inch. The fourth suspect is the one that we should be the most worried about. He's the ringleader. We find him and this thing ends. Breslin. Bres, we got another dead body at the Bell Hotel. What do you got for me? Hello, Garrison. Bres... remember what I told you about Spitz's puncture wound... and the chance of it being intentional? Yeah, you said it was impossible. I take it back. Yeah. It's the same. Almost to the millimeter. That means we're looking for someone with medical training. No, we're looking for a medical savant. It is all the same. Except, no rig. He checked in Monday afternoon with a single suitcase. According to registration he's staying indefinitely. Nobody lives in a hotel unless they're homeless... or they're hiding from somebody. He knew that they were coming for him next. And the only person who knew how he knew that is in a vinyl bag. Excuse me. And now the only person with a motive is in a vinyl bag. Every lead we had is in a vinyl bag. What? Sean told me that he helped you today. He was really excited. Yeah, right. Maybe next time you shouldn't be showing a 7-year-old... photographs of a murder scene. Alex, I did not show them to him, he found them... and I took them away from him. Whatever. Hey, Alex! Look, thanks for taking such good care of Sean. You've been really great with him. You have parent-teacher conferences tonight. I reminded you last week. What time? Five minutes ago. Oh, shit. Shit. Shit! Alex has so much potential, which is why it's so frustrating. He's not doing well? He does great when he's here. That's just not very often. Alex is what we call a maximum result-minimum effort student. He doesn't have to try very hard to do well, so, he doesn't. Well, that's... kind of my fault. I don't... really get to spend as much time with him as I would like. His group therapist used to say... On the other hand, if I can be frank... I think it's a good sign that Alex is trying at all. It's not often the case with children who've lost a parent. Yep. I'm sure. Alright, go get in bed. Hey... I was thinking maybe Sean and I could take you to school tomorrow. Make sure you actually go. That's good. Good night. Thank you for seeing me this morning. Of course, but Kristin... I'm not sure that I'm the person you should be talking to. I'm not trained and... I just want to talk to a normal person... not a man in a crisp suit with a tape recorder. Okay. Well I should also tell you that... I'm not very good with children. I'm not a child. No, of course you're not. Do you have any kids? I have two sons. What kind of things do you all do together? We don't really do a lot of stuff together. Why not? Well, it's a lot of things. Sean, he's young and I'm just figuring him out. And Alex, well, I was ... so focused on my job for so long that l... I sort of missed his childhood. My parents did that. They thought my mom was infertile. They were going to pick a baby. But then my mom found out about the orphanages. About us. The older ones. I remember the first time I saw her, when she came in. I was eight. I wanted her to take me with her so bad. I couldn't tell her. But she did anyway. I came here to the States. They were my parents and I was their daughter. It was just like I always dreamed it would be. The next year Teresa was born. Doctors said it was a miracle. That must have been hard. Why do people do the things they do? I don't know. I'm so sorry. Sorry? What do you have to be sorry about? I didn't know... this was inside her. Why do people do the things they do? Why are you wasting our time? I know what you're going to ask me five minutes before you do. Detective Breslin... if you'd like to come in here, I will tell you things. I wonder, Aidan, what do you think of me? You thought I was this sweet girl who had been wronged by the world. What do you think now? I still think that. Really? The moment I met you... I knew we would have a special relationship. So, why your mother? Because I hate my father. Why not him? Would you rather be dead... or live the rest of your life without your soul mate? I'd rather be dead. Well, you just might be, Kristin. Do you realize that? Why'd you turn yourself in to me? I was craving some good conversation. You're not Death. Do you know the difference between Death and War, Detective? Yes. Death is a physicality, War is a state of mind. You're right. Death is what happens at the end. War is everything else. What is everything else? You mean, you haven't found them yet? There's books, trophies... creepy-ass clown dolls. We got some clothes, cartoons... Cartoons? Yeah. She's a little old for cartoons. Here. Here's another one. Garrison Jacobs. Mary Anne Spitz. No. Why are you doing this? What does it feel like? Does it feel like you're weightless? You should feel like you don't exist. Do you feel expendable yet? Does your heart tell you that it's your time to come and see the end. Yes! Oh, God! Now you feel like I do. At war for the last ten years of my life. Fighting against the things he does, and the way you forget. No, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm your daughter and you allowed me to hurt. Now you die. The war's inside you now. War and then death. You're going to drown now, Mom. Oh my God! Oh my God! Stingray! Where the fuck are you? I didn't know you guys were here. I thought you were one of them. I know what you did. What the fuck? Did you come here tonight looking for these? She's getting under your skin, Detective. Manipulating you to believe whatever she wants you to believe. Stingray... why don't you go call Child Services... and tell them to pick up the Spitz daughters. Mr. Spitz is going to jail. Will do. Let me tell you something. She's a fucking monster. Your room is very red. Come on, Aidan. I know you understand what we're doing. No, I don't. Don't lie. You do. You saw the pictures. You know what he did to me. Then you know just as well as I do. Taking her wouldn't have been enough. He needs to know that she hurt inside like I did. Twelve hours in exchange for ten years? I think that's a pretty favorable trade. And what about the rest, Kristin? Garrison Jacobs. Steven Silva. What did they do to you? Hm? There's going to be more, isn't there? Three people does not make an apocalypse. How many more, Kristin? Four Horsemen. Four offerings. No more. Aidan... you are not going to find them. You forgot? No, I didn't forget. I would never forget that. It's just that... Alex, we can't keep doing this every year. You know, it's just... Hey, I don't know how many times I have to explain myself. Just because I don't show it doesn't mean I don't miss her. You don't know what she went through. I was there! I was there for every biopsy. Every chemotherapy. You weren't there when it mattered! That case you were working on when mom was dying? Was it worth it? Bres... The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse by Albrecht Durer. Woodcarving, 1498. Beautiful, right? Yeah. We got this from Garrison Jacobs' stomach. I think they made him eat it. Exodus 9:15. The computer that this chip came out of... I need to know where it is. Can you trace it? If this system was ever inventoried online... we can connect the chip to the lP address. And that will tell you where it is? Pretty much. If the lP was assigned by the CO... we can geo-locate all the way down to a street address. Do it. Computer guy's got a location on the chip. Let's go. Get out of the way! Halt! Damn it! He went down the fire escape! Bring 'em down. We got 'em. We just saw him running down the alley! Everybody out! Come on! Clear the room! Come on! Move it! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Bres! Come on! Fuck! Let it go, Bres! Let's go! It's evidence! Let it go! Let's go, c'mon! Fuck! Very interesting. Bres, your suspect got away. We're setting up a perimeter. We got lucky about one thing. Tell him, Terrence. They wound magnesium ribbons through the drives... around the RAM. Burns at 4,000 degrees. It's pretty smart, but... the magnesium didn't catch in this one. Gives me a good place to start. I saw a web page on this monitor-- "We are the nothing" If that was on this, would you be able to find it? Give me some time. Do it quick. Black. Red. Green. The Four Horsemen. I ordered you a coffee. Black with two sugars. So. What do you want? Mom and dad support me. I don't understand why you can't. Mom and dad support you? No. Mom and dad don't understand this. They don't understand why you're doing this. I don't understand it. It doesn't even affect them. Or you. Doesn't affect us? Hey, fuck you! It doesn't fuckin' affect us? Fuck you! You have no fuckin' idea. Do you know what it's like to walk down the street... having people say, "Oh, there goes Taylor Kurth." "You know his little brother's a faggot?" Having to suffer the indignity... of people talking shit about your own fucking blood. And knowing that they are right. Fuck you. What the fuck are you doing? Stop fucking crying. Fucking stop it. I will fucking walk out of here. What the fuck you looking at? Go fucking clean something. Knock this shit off. Right? Be a fucking man. Jesus Christ, for once in your fucking life. This isn't how I wanted tonight to go. What did you expect, Corey? That I was gonna change my mind? Tell you how happy I am that my little brother takes it up the ass? Come on. Fuck, man. I just... I didn't want it to have to come to this... Seriously, just shut the fuck up. Okay? I'm fuckin' exhausted. Just drive me home. Drive me home. I just wanna go home. Go to bed. Jesus. You alright? Don't touch me. Is that you? Yeah. Okay. Excuse me? Everything in your pockets. And do it fast. Hey, you take another step back and I'll cut you like a fucking pig. Hell follows... What's that? I said Hell follows with me. Owen Rundell -- 35, seven priors. Breaking and entering, petty theft, assault with attempt to rob. Amateur shit across the board. Tonight Mr. Rundell here tried to mug the wrong cat. Victim fought back, put a nice little hole in his side. And? Tell him. He told me not to worry... 'cause he purposely avoided hitting my organs. Did you see his face? Yeah. Could you describe him to a sketch artist? Yeah. Great. Get our best artist on this. I want this done fast - as in right now! And fax it to every medical facility in a 200 mile radius. Check it against employees, residents, candystripers, whoever. Find him. I'm on it. Hold on for him. Hello, this is Detective Breslin. Hi. This is Lee Shoemaker. I'm a registered nurse at the University hospital. I know Corey. Do you have his last name? Thank you. Kurth. Corey Kurth. K-U-R-T-H. This is dispatch. Can we have an address on Corey Kurth? 555 Canal Street. Back-up is on the way. We found green, but we have no horseman. I feel fuckin' weird. Oh, no, no, no... Jesus Christ. Holy Christ! Somebody help me. Somebody! I want to get the fuck outta here- I wanna get out. Corey? Oh Jesus Chris, what the hell is going on? Corey! Oh, shit. Corey? Corey! Oh my god, somebody get me out of this fucking thing. Help. Oh, fuck, is that you? Corey, can you get me out of this fucking thing. Oh my God. Oh, Corey- get me out of this fucking thing. There's fucking hooks in my... Corey, what the fuck are you doing? Get me out of this thing. Get me out of this fucking thing- get me outta this fuckin' thing. Jesus, man, what are you doing? What is this? I don't understand, man. I don't understand what you're doing to me. Yes, you do. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I was wrong. I didn't mean any of those things I said. I didn't mean any of it. I'm sorry. I was being stupid. I'm your brother, Corey. Come on, what are you doing? We can't both live like this anymore. Having an older brother who can't support me... and be happy for me like I am for him. I looked up to you so much! Let's talk about it. Come on. I'm sorry. No! No more talking! What the fuck are you doing? The pain needs to go away. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The pain is going to go away tonight. Let me out of this fucking thing right now! Corey, let me out of this fucking thing! I swear to God! You fucking let me out of this thing! Oh, no. Corey, stop it. Corey! What the fuck are you doing? Don't do it! My name is Detective Breslin. I'm afraid I have to ask you a few questions. Taylor, can you hear me? Taylor? I can hear you. Can you tell me what happened? Which part do you want to hear? The part where my brother hung me up? Or the part where he made me watch watch... Taylor, I need you to help me understand why he did it. 'Cause he's a fuckin' faggot. He's a fucking faggot. He's a fucking faggot. You're a fucking faggot... a fucking faggot! Can you guys get these hooks out of him. Excuse me. How did he do that to himself?. PCP? Enough to kill a small mule. It's the closest I've seen someone come to... cutting out their own heart. So, you found Corey? Yes. Tell me about it. He's dead. Corey was a remarkable person. I don't doubt that. You and Corey are from different worlds. How did two people like you and Corey meet? You want to know how people like us can meet each other? We are the nothing. How can we not meet each other? The world lives in my bedroom, Aidan. And in Corey's. And in anyone else's... who's looking for something or someone they can't find at home. So... did Taylor hurt? Oh, yeah. He's really fucked up. Does that make you happy? Is that what you think? We do what we do and all of a sudden we are happy? You don't know the first thing about hurt. But you're paying attention now, aren't you? Yes, I'm paying attention now, Kristin. I have four victims. I only have two Horsemen. I can save you a lot of time and energy right now. You're not going to catch Pestilence ever. And the Rider of the White Horse? You don't find someone like that. Someone like that finds you. Oh, really? Is that how it happened? The Rider of the White Horse found all of you? Put this all together? Created a forum to show the world? Yes. That's what a leader does. You could learn a lot from him. Don't be like that. Where's Sean? I let him go to a friend's house for dinner. I didn't expect you back. Can we talk? This place is great. Who do you come here with? Friends? Yeah, sometimes I come with friends. Recently, though, I've just been by myself. Sometimes I'll come after school or whatever... when Sean's with a friend, or you're working through dinner. We should start coming here together. Once a week. We'll come on the same day. We could make this... one of our things. Right. Dad, Sean is starting to ask a lot of questions. Like, why you're not around, things like that. I can answer those, but he's gonna start asking about Mom. Alex... I want you to know that ... I am so sorry that you had to have... that moment with your mom alone. Do you know what I would give... to have had that moment with her instead of you? It's not that you weren't there that night. It's that you never came back. Well The whole deal with your mom, it was hard on everybody. But, I'm coming back now, okay? This is me telling you that I am back. Alex, l... this case that I've been working on. It's bad. It's really bad- but it's almost over. And after this case it's all gonna be different. Everything is gonna be different? Promise. Western Division has a case they need you on. Attempted rape. Apparently he's a heck of a biter. Briefing's this afternoon. Hey Krupa. Wait - wait a minute. Yeah? I don't have time for this. There's still two Horsemen out there. They told us to expect four victims. We have four victims. No, we don't. They're not finished. Let me explain something to you. They chose the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse for a reason. Did you know the word apocalypse does not mean the end of the world? No. The literal translation of it is "the lifting of the veil." This whole time they have been trying to show us something. They're leaving clues. It all ties in together. This is the website that the computer was connected to. It's a forum. There are thousands of members on it. Do you see that date? That's new. That wasn't there. When I first saw that, that was a place to type in a password. That's tomorrow. This whole time, they have been trying to lead us to something. They're building to something. Don't you see? Building to what? I don't know but it's going to happen tomorrow. Now, we know two of them. if we could find out what connected them... then maybe that will lead us to find the other two. I need more time to find this out. We don't have more time. Just drop it! You gotta let this go. We don't have... -What I do not have time for is... Krupa! The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were sent here... to initiate hell on earth. And it's happening tomorrow! Fine. You got twenty-four hours. They've been leaving breadcrumbs for us. Well, we must have missed a couple of those crumbs, cause... Bres? Four " Come and Sees." One in each direction. Mary Anne Spitz. One, two, three, four. Silva's apartment. One, two, three, four. Garrison Jacobs' hotel room There's only three. Yeah. That's why that there's no rig, no ceremony... no paint, no necklace. Nothing taken from the body. That's why the veil hasn't been lifted yet. Garrison Jacobs is not the third victim. What was he? Garrison Jacobs is Pestilence. I was trying to get my beauty sleep. Garrison Jacobs tricked us into punishing an innocent. What did he tell you? He told us Silva molested his son. He lied to you. He was-- heartbroken and lying. So we bled him. And you could afford to kill him... because you didn't need Pestilence like you needed the others. He just operated the computers. It would have been nice...to have carried the Pestilence theme throughout. Three Horsemen just doesn't have the same ring. That means there's one less horseman. Which means there's going to be another victim. Does it eat at you, Detective Breslin? That three of the four of us are off the streets and you had nothing to do with it? We would have caught you. Really. Goodbye, Kristin. "The great day of His wrath has come." "Who shall be able to stand?" Who shall be able to stand? Maybe that's why they used the rigs? Find something? They were both in group therapy. Who were the doctors? Annette Richardson and... Annette Richardson. We'll look her up and we'll pay her a visit. Oh, God. We thought we should call you because of your background in... Forensic Odontology. Bres, what's the matter? Kristin has acted like she's known me... ever since the day she turned herself in. That's because she does. The teeth were placed on that pond... to guarantee that I would be assigned to the case. They're after me and my family. Stingray, I want you to do me a favor. Go to my house and I want you to take care of Alex. I'm gonna pick up Sean. What's going on, Bres? When Karen died Alex was in group therapy. Same doctor. This is Aidan Breslin. I'm driving there now. I'm his father. I just need someone to tell me if he's in his classroom. Bres, Bres? Stingray? It's me. At the house. What the fuck? Stingray! Stingray! Shit! Stingray. Ray. Police Emergency. How can I help you? This is Detective Aidan Breslin, 14th precinct. I have an officer badly injured, 28th and Nanty Street. You don't find someone like that. Someone like that finds you. He does great when he's here. That's just not very often. Alex?. Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex, answer me! Dad? It's gonna be alright, Alex. I'm gonna get you down! Hold on! It's gonna be okay, Alex! It's gonna be alright. I'm bleeding. I'm supposed to drown, not bleed. No you're not! Yes I am! You have to know! This won't end with us. There is no Four Horsemen. There's millions of them. They're born into this fucked up world... by parents who are unwilling to even try to understand them. I understand. And it won't end until every parent in this fucked up society... realizes that it does apply to them. They're watching us right now. They're waiting for the last Horseman to make the final sacrifice. Waiting for the sign... my death to begin the apocalypse. The veil will be lifted and the people will finally see. Alex, please tell me you didn't do these things. Tell me you didn't do this to yourself. Why? Because I'm your son? You haven't been in my room in three years. All you had to do was go in my room. Alex... I told you it would be different. It can still be different. Alex?. Alex?. Alex?. No! No! Alex! Alex! No! No! No! Alex! Alex?. Alex! Alex?. Alex?. Alex! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Look at me! Alex! Alex?. Dad. Dad... You were right. You were right. After your mom died l, I never came back. I never came back. I wasn't there for you and Sean. Please... I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. Give me a chance to be a father to you. We're gonna be alright. Whatever happens... I'm never gonna leave you again. It's gonna be alright. I'm not gonna let you die. Sean? Sean? Dad... Yeah. I had a bad dream. You did? I'm here now. Where's Alex?. Don't you worry about Alex. Alex is going to be okay. I love you, Sean. I love you too, Daddy.
