When will you have lunch with Dad? You promised. Hello? I can't hear you, I'm in the elevator. Didn't you promise we'd have dinner a week ago? It's the start of the month, I'm busy at work. I'm tired from work, dear, can't do it. Stay at work. I'll get engaged to someone else. - Come and have coffee at my place? - You must show me the apartment first. I'll take a shower and come over. Is it the beginning of the month or what? You have three minutes to get here, jerk. Calm down. Take a tissue, they're nice and soft. Calm down, please. Hello? Give us the room. - How are you, Ramzi? - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Not the first girl to complain about you. When I approach a girl, sir, then realize she's silly, I run. What can I do with you? I believe you, about the girls. But what about work? I've appointed you to every position in my company. HR, you said it wasn't your area of expertise. Accounting... How does seven plus six make 11? - I'm more of a words man. - A words man? I'm tired, wanna sit in my chair? Go ahead. - No, sir, I shouldn't. - Sit in my chair! If that's what you want, sir. Where are you going? Are you here to work or find a wife? I'll tell you something. I'll tell you why I've had enough. - Have a... - Have a seat. - Should I sit? - Yes. Thank you, I shouldn't. - No, sir, sit. You're welcome. - Thanks. Thanks, this office is your office. A question. What did you do with the HR file? I didn't do anything, I had a meeting with Murad. Fine, how was that? I didn't attend it because I was finishing my report. I wanted to ask you about that, how's it going? I wanted to do the HR file first. Where is this HR file? Am I going to work or answer all these questions? Why am I blaming him? The guy's done nothing wrong. Should he work or answer my questions? Listen. Since you're comfortable here at the company, and doing whatever you want, can I, as your manager, do one thing? - Sure, sir. - I'm going to move you to Department Ten. - Why? - It's nice, no chit-chatting, all the employees there are men. I wanted to work there, but they wouldn't agree to it. Mr. Murad, don't let my bad performance at work give you a bad impression of me. - What was that? - Okay. Don't get a bad impression of me because my performance... That's the impression you give, son. Listen, you're not fit to work, or to be a husband. Come in. Welcome, madam. You... shine more radiantly with every day that passes. - Thanks, dear. - By the way, that color really suits you. - Thanks. - Mr. Ramzi. If I may, that's my wife. Will you leave her for me? - I'm sorry, I'll leave now. - Go. This time doesn't count. We'll meet again. What is it, Mirvat? Why are you mad? I can't take your daughter Leila's craziness anymore. I've had enough! I want to know, what is this craziness? Where will this craziness end? By the way, we're not walking, we're running. It's okay, Hanoun, it's a marathon. I don't know what that is, is it a "Kidacon"? What's a "Kidacon"? I told you, it's a marathon. Marathon! Marathon, idiot! Yes, right. When will we finish? - What's the first prize? - No one will win anything. - We keep running until we die. - What? Why? Why? Excuse me, madam. - Why did you push that lady? - She was outrunning us. So what? Let her outrun us, we're running for a cause. Cause? All this for a cause? Let's stop, woman. Why are we running without a purpose? We have a purpose. We're running for the poor, the poor people who don't have water and will die of thirst. Better to die of thirst than of the exhaustion we're feeling right now. Honestly, I'm very tired. I can't keep going. - Leila, I'm thirsty. - Thirsty? I'll give you some water, but don't let the bottle touch your lips. - No, I won't. - Okay, here you go. Please, darling, some water. Sorry, madam. This last bit is for him. Let's continue for our cause. How do you get into Department Ten? I don't know. We know nothing about anyone who's gone there. No one knows if they're dead or alive. You'll have no salary left, Ramzi. You'll spend your salary on gas, or you'll get trampled on microbuses and auto-buses. - Settle things with him quick, Ramzi. - No, seems he's serious this time, Muhab. Fine, talk to him when he's calm. But don't talk to him while you're holding that thing. Murad, what do you think about Ramzi? - Ramzi? - Yes. He's an idiot. Why are you making that sound? He's polite, chic and gentle, and very handsome. What if we have him meet Leila? He's a player. He thinks all women are like you. - What? - Sorry, I didn't mean that. I mean, he thinks that when women get married they're just mothers and dull... Don't worry about it. Talk to him. She might like him. At the very least, it might get rid of her craziness. Don't forget, talk to him. What? I won't talk to him. They come here, give me orders, then leave. I won't do it! Sit down. Again? Fine. Do you ever wonder why you're not stable at work? - Because... - Because you're not stable in life. Ever wonder why you're not stable in life? - Because... - You refuse to settle down. - Ever wonder how I settled down? - I wanted to ask you first. - Marriage. - What? New responsibilities will stop you messing around here. You developed your psychological skills fast. - Do you think of me as a father? - No. Great. You won't mind the bride, then. - Leila Murad. - Isn't she dead? What? Who died? See? See what your slow mind made you think? I'm Murad and you know I have a daughter. Sure, sir. I am very honored. But I'm not ready to settle down and take on any new responsibilities. We were all like you, but we still settled down and got married. I'm not fit to work or to be a husband. If you're fit as a husband, I'll make you fit for work. Department Ten! Come on! - Department Ten! - Let's go! Quickly! I'm at your service, sir. Whatever you want. Off you go, I'll arrange for you to meet her. - Yes, sir. - Go, champion! Mr. Murad, concerning Department Ten... No, I promise you, I won't move you there. God bless you, sir. Stand there. Where's Ramzi's pretty smile? If not for marriage, then for Department Ten. - We're lost! Lost! - Calm down, people. Shahoudi sent me her location, but I don't have 3G. Can you find someone who does? - Among these people? - Yes. Guys! Does anyone have 3G? I'm connected to the Al Ayat Network, not to 3G. - You heard him. - I'm not connected to the Al Ayat Network, either. I have a connection! This way. Lola, I've found you a groom, you can meet him today. You know I'll never get married that way. Tonight at seven o'clock. You feisty girl! Hi, how are you? I'm Leila. So, prince, what do you do? Prince? I'm such a silly girl! Open FaceTime, I want to show you something. Okay. What do you think? The good old days! You remind me of Two-Face from Batman. You idiot! Is this side better, or is this side better? Right side first, and if he likes it, good, if not, show him your left side. It's my fault for even asking you. Let's talk about what's important. Is this groom handsome or as bad as you are? Listen, he's fine, he's tall and he has a beard. He's like those salesmen who work at Zara. You know what I mean? - I'll call you later. - My God! You look beautiful. - What do you think, Mom? - What's this? What have you done? What is it, Mom? I'm trying things out. Is the braid prettier than the wavy hair? I think the wavy hair's best, right? Stop it! Stop this craziness! You're killing me! Why are you like this? I tell you what, you're very tired. Leave her to me. - She's very stressed. - Yes. Yes, she's stressed. A braid and wavy hair? What do you think? The braid, right? Look, I'm a farmer and I tend to like braids more, Good job, Murad. Listen, dear. This guy works at my company. I don't want any scandals. It's enough that I agreed to meet this handsome man, this overly-pretty man. God created us all, dear. By the way, I cancelled my trip to El-Wahat specifically for this gorgeous, tanned man. - What would you have done there? - I would've saved the foxes. - Who'd save you from the foxes? - I don't know who'd save me. You know what? Let this beautiful man save me and we'll be done with it. By the way, that red color in your hair looks great. If you wear jeans, you'll look amazing. So, prince, what do you do? There's Ramzi over there! What is it, Murad? Aren't we here to meet him? Yes, right. I forgot. Can you call me Dad here, not Murad? Just so that he believes I am your father. Just once. Ramzi! Dear son. - How are you? - I really missed you. May God bless you. - Hello, dear. How are you, Ramzi? - Hello. Come on, I have work in the morning. Didn't I tell you this was a bad idea, Mirvat? When I was a kid, I was the prettiest girl in school. And I was the most popular girl in school. Tell you what, last year alone, my friends threw me about ten surprise parties. My dad's friends, my mom's friends, my friends from school, my friends from Nazlet El-Semman, my friends from the shelter. - Friends from the shelter? - Afraid so. So many men have asked me to marry them. I can't remember how many. I remember how many. I don't like handsome, tanned men. Men like Ahmed Ezz are not my type. I like men like Osama Mounir. Do you know him? Mounir, I like his show. By the way, I was the HR manager in a bank. I used to scare all the men there. One look is all it took to terrify them. All the women were so girly, they came in in the morning holding coffees. The doorman in my office was named Almani. I used to come in in the morning and shout, "Almani!" and he would bring me tea. - Your daughter is stupid and petty. - Don't let him know that. He's much stupider than she is anyway. You know? I think young men only need one thing, an opportunity. An opportunity that they can then hold onto. What's the solution, then? The opportunity. The opportunity? - Are you talking to me. - Yes. - I think we should leave now. - Let's go. Why are you standing up? Sit. You stay here, darling. Who'll drive me home, Mom? - Ramzi, of course. - I wish I could. The problem is that I live in Zayed and Maadi is on the other side of town. - What's wrong with Maadi? - It's far away. It's not further than Department Ten. Sure, sir. - Good evening. - Good evening. What can I get you? I want a green salad and the tomato soup, please. - I'd like a "Steek." - "Steek"? What's a "Steek"? A slice of grilled meat. Meat? I don't understand how you can eat meat. With our hands, like everyone eats it. It's a living creature, like you and me. It's slaughtered so that you can eat it, and you call it "Steek." Do you want someone to slaughter and eat you? Why slaughter me? Am I a buffalo? He's already dead, should we let his sacrifice be in vain? - Fine! Bring me a salad. - We have a Caesar salad with chicken. Chicken? Would you like someone to do that to you? You lay your eggs, then you're slaughtered and put in a salad? I'll have croutons with it. All right, I'll talk to you until our food is served. One time, Mom called the pharmacist at two in the morning. The pharmacist didn't show up. Do you know what I did? I took my car... ...after she tried my food, she was amazed that I'm such a good cook, and yet I'm still so fit and healthy. I look fat, but actually, I'm chubby. I'm chubby because I have health problems, not because I eat a lot. I eat very little. Just a few bites. Please, can you connect my phone to the charger for half an hour? For the sake of Department Ten. Tell me, any news about them? No, but they're late, so hopefully it's good news. When I feel sad, I'll post a dark picture on Facebook. Even though all my friends post pictures of themselves in their bikinis, I won't wear a bikini because I'm from a reserved family. - Check, please. - Why? I might start to feel hungry again after a while. And I like filling out the comment cards. I didn't like some aspects of the service here. The tomato soup was nice, but it upset my stomach. - I need to go to the restroom. - Great! Go ahead. Tell you what, get the check, fast! - Muhab, where are you right now? - Is she pretty or ugly? Hideous! You have to come and save me, right now. Pretend you want me to drive you or your dad to the hospital. - Anything. - You're doomed if she looks like her dad. Anyway, it's just one night, you'll get through it. It's the night from hell. SHITTY BOSS Wait, her dad is calling, stay alert. Son-in-law! Tell me! No! He should know about your lifestyle first. I feel like there's real chemistry between us. I feel like she's one of my family, like my sister. You know marriage between family members isn't good. Did you notice, Mom, how eager he was to drive me home? Wait, Mom. I have another call. Hanoun! How are you? So? Should I get my suit cleaned for the wedding? I'm afraid I won't be able to provide for her the way you're able to provide for her. You're a wealthy man, and, and, no one can... no one... and you... You're our only hope and... He indirectly asked for my number more than once and I ignored it. Why didn't you give it to him? We all know you want to get married. No, your salary will increase and you'll get promoted. He must like dogs. Everything is in God's hands. Come and join us. I'll wait for you. Bye. Yes, Mom. We'll continue this tomorrow, bye. Sure, where could he meet someone like you? - All right, bye. - Hang up now, bye. Okay, bye. It's going great. - Yes. - Didn't I tell you? I'm sorry I was so long. Does tomato soup cause constipation? No, it ruins appetites. My friend Muhab is coming now, he has a problem he needs help with. My friend Hanoun is coming, too. He's my best friend, I want you to meet him. He's a bit weird, but you'll like him. - Do you mind? - Not at all. Cheers to you both, relax. You're very open minded. Do you have a problem? No, sir, I don't speak German. Ask her. I graduated from Al Saeediya School. I don't have to tell you, you must protect it well. - Sure. - You don't know - how important this is. - Yes. This is so... I don't... I don't want to talk again, deal? - Sure. - And you. Don't agonize him. Why did he say, "don't circumcise him" to you? What did he mean? He didn't say "circumcise," he said "a-go-nize." Why did he say that? Am I agonizing you, Ramzi? So you got uneasy about me? Your friend is impolite, by the way. - He's your friend. - What? I swear I don't know him. What? He wasn't the friend you're waiting for? He wasn't the friend you're waiting for? My God! He left a briefcase. There's a bomb in it, for sure. - A bomb? - It's a case containing a bomb. Open it. Careful! It's been a bad night from the very start. - My God! - Don't let it explode in your face. It'll explode in your face, too. - It's full of money, - Where's the bomb? - A lot of money. - There could be a bomb underneath it. A briefcase can carry money or a bomb. It can't carry both. What will we do now? I'm very scared, Ramzi. That tomato soup has given me a terrible stomachache. Stay here until you feel better, - I'll take the bomb outside. - Are you crazy? I'll come with you. - Ramzi! Wait! - Leave me alone! I can't run in these heels. - Why should I care? - Ramzi, wait. - I said, wait. - You're getting in my car? Yes, I'm getting in your car. I'm coming with you. Ramzi, we should give this money back to whoever it belongs to. You believed me when I said I didn't know him? He's my acquaintance. Your acquaintance, man? Listen, Leila. I'll go and give the money back right now. But you should stay here to meet Hanoun. Ramzi, if you don't act responsibly, I'll ask Dad to move you to the other side of the world. - What? You really don't care? - No, not at all. I don't get why your family loves to take pictures so much. That's a nice picture. I'll send it to the family group chat. Say hi to them all, especially Hanoun. Go. Sure, I'll say hi to them. My family is very nice. My uncle is the deputy director of security in Cairo. My mom's cousin is the manager of "Where Did You Get This From?" And Abir, our housekeeper, is also Ragaa Al-Giddawy's housekeeper. What do you want, Leila? I think that money is stolen. We should return it. It'd be a shame to return it. That money is as much mine as it is yours. Nice! Very nice! Each of us will take our share, and is free to do whatever they want with it. That's nice. Some for you... some for me. Some for you... and some for me. Don't be so silly. By the way, I'm not taking this money for myself. I'm going to donate it to the shelter. Donate it to the center, do whatever you want. What center? I said, shelter. The animal shelter. They need money more than anyone and no one is taking care of them, Ramzi. You're free, go. If you don't drive me there, I'll send this cute picture of you to my family. You're a snake! Fine. But after I drive you there, we're free to do whatever we want. - Deal? - Deal. - They're not here, let's go. - Wait, man. They're asleep, it's late. - Who is it? - I want to donate some money. No, we close at eight. Can you come back tomorrow? No, I can't leave with this money. It's half a million pounds. You're going to donate half a million pounds to stray dogs? Most Egyptians can have breakfast for a pound. It's not just for food, it's for operations and treatment, too. Treatment? I have an abscessed tooth I've been wanting to fix for a month. Don't worry. You can ask for a Hollywood smile now, for you and your parents. What's that weird noise? It's very annoying. You're stepping on a cat! - You should be ashamed of yourself! - What's wrong? Why are you shouting? Nothing's wrong. This is the biggest donation we've ever received. Do you know how many animals you'll save? And how many men will die of disappointment? What's wrong with you? Did you donate anything? Mind your own business. A mouse, don't be scared! - No! Don't be scared! - Wait! What are you doing? - I'll kill it with my shoe! - That's my hamster. That's a mouse, I know exactly what it is. It's not a mouse, it's a hamster. It's their pet! They keep the white ones and kill the black ones? That's racism, madam! Ramzi, go and sit with the dogs over there. I'm so sorry, he didn't know it was your hamster. - He thought it was someone else's. - No worries. Do you need anything else from me? What you did... I'll post your picture on our page. No, don't post anything on Facebook, please. You know what they say, "A good deed dies when it's spoken about." I thank you. Ramzi! Ramzi! Let's go! They have some great wolfdogs there. Not just wolfdogs, griffons, too, right? I took this. The wolf attacked the griffon. It's chaos in there. Here, madam. It was great meeting you, Leila. Say hi to your dad for me. As we agreed, Dad can't know anything about the briefcase. Of course. And remember to take care of this marriage thing. He already hates me, thank God. Don't worry, no need to come up with any more flaws, you have enough. Most importantly, we don't know each other and we don't speak to one another. - Yes, sure. - Goodbye. So obnoxious. What? - What is it? - I'm starting to feel bad. You should. I told you not to donate it, Leila. No, I feel bad 'cause I want you to donate the briefcase. I'll have to empty it first. No, funny guy, I meant what's inside the case. What? Didn't we have an agreement? - There are no agreements in illicit acts. - Leave me alone. Your dad makes my days miserable. Don't make my nights miserable, too. If I leave you, I'll feel bad day and night. You don't feel bad when you donate half a million to dogs, but feel bad leaving the money with me? Think of me as one of those dogs. Do you know what will happen if you don't donate the money? - What? - I'll have a bad impression of you. No! No, Leila. No bad impressions. It seems being nice doesn't work with you. - Help! He's harassing me! - Stop it. Stop it! What's wrong with you, Ramzi? You've persuaded me. All right, get out of the car and I'll go and donate it, before the man in charge of donations leaves. Swear that you'll donate the money. I swear. May your dad die and the company burn if I'm lying. May your dad drown... I'll donate it now. You may leave. No, I'm coming with you, prince. AL-NOUR CHARITY FOUNDATION I don't care, I'm coming with you. Why must you come with me? I'll donate it and come right back. Great. Take your time, I'll wait for you here in the car. - Where is he? - Up there, sir. Here he is, sir. DONATIONS Peace be upon you. Peace and Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you. - I want to donate some money. - How much, son? - Five hundred thousand pounds. - Five hundred pounds? Five hundred thousand pounds. - A thousand pounds? - Five hundred thousand pounds. God enlighten you, son. What's the amount? Five hundred thousand pounds, sir. Here. Here. Here. - Here. - Fine, I need to ask you something. - What's the source of this donation? - I didn't want to waste my blessings. May God bless you, son. May He double the blessings you're donating to the poor. Let them pray for me. My name is Ramzi and my mother is Angie. May God compensate you, son. I won't pay Zakat anymore. - As you wish, son. - Great. As for Ramadan, should I fast, or are we even? Stop it. I was protecting you from going to jail. I'd rather go to jail. What's upsetting me, and hurting me, is that it turns out he was only looking for the restroom. - Who was looking for the restroom? - The security guard. - I don't understand anything, Ramzi. - You never understand anything. I'm the one to blame. I'm the one to blame. I'm the one to blame. I tell you what, I want nothing more to do with you. Tomorrow, I'll quit. I want nothing more to do with you, either. "I'm the one to blame." What is that? But you need to drive me home, because Hanoun left. May you and your dad and Hanoun die on the same day! May you die, jerk! From now on... I, I, I don't know you and you don't know me. I don't talk to you and you don't talk to me. Come on, drive me home already. Sing it. Sabir! Sabir! - Please, cover yourself. - Come cover me. Who are you? - What did you do with the money? - What money? - The association's money. - How did you know? What, Ramzi? Mrs. Sanaa's association. She's picking it up now. She's going from office to office like she's shopping in a mall. Mrs. Sanaa? Go away, Muhab. Murad isn't here? He came in late and asked for you. He wants to see you. - Does he seem mad? - He's always mad, Ramzi. - Does he seem mad at me? - He's always mad at you, Ramzi. Yes, sir. Talk to me. - What happened last night? - Could you consider me your son, and not just as the only man you rely on at work? I only rely on you... It's not the time for this. Sure. I loved her. From the bottom of my heart. But... she didn't love me in return. She didn't love me, man. She's only known you a few hours, she hasn't had time to fall for you. I've known you for ages and I don't love you. I don't think it'll ever happen. She told me, "No! Stay away. Stay away, Ramzi. You're not the one I'm waiting for. It's not you. It's not you. It's not you." I couldn't believe it. Why, God? I meet the woman I've been dreaming of, who has no flaws, and she doesn't want me. Fine, let me talk to her. We'll see. But... Son... I didn't... I... You... Please, Mr. Murad. I'm not the type of man who builds his happiness on someone else's misery. I'll live the rest of my life in my memories, engulfed in pain and hurt. I'm not the type of man who could live off a woman's money. We're poor, yes, but we will keep our dignity. Are you done? I said, let me... That's her. Where are you going? Are you shy? Hello? Forgive me, I overslept. Tell me. You're happy? He's the one? Want to talk to him? Girl! You shouldn't... Girl! Listen, girl! No, girl! We still haven't said yes. Here, mister. Here, groom. Why aren't you answering my calls? What do you want? What did you say to your dad? Can you stop being rude and come down? I'm waiting for you. - Come down where? - Ramzi. Please, don't say anything to Dad. - I'm not coming down. - Sure? Whatever you want. Let me talk to Dad so that I can ask him to screw you over. Fine, I'm coming down. I can't get rid of you! She had to say "have Dad screw you over" for you to go down? I'm on the other side, now. Where are you? Can you raise your hand so that I can see you? Yes, sir. He's the one who stole the briefcase. - She stole the briefcase. - No, he did! - Where's the briefcase? - I'll go and get you another right now. Wait! I didn't take a penny for myself. You have the blessings of many people now. And animals, too, by the way. Look, you two! Give me the million pounds or I'll kill you both! Can we give you thirty thousand and you only kill her? - You terrible man! - Wait! I have a solution. I'll go get the case now, you can keep her in the meantime. If I don't come back, she's yours. You can do whatever you want with her. Catch him, sir! He's a thief and he wants the briefcase. I'll tell you something. I'll go for half an hour and be back. You're driving me crazy! If I don't have the briefcase in an hour, you're both dead. Thank you. I'm so scared! Where were they? When I was leaving the house, they were outside. How did they find you? I wrote my name, number and address down on the comment card for evaluating the service, remember? Were you evaluating them or applying for a job? I thought I might win something. Don't you dare touch me! I'm out of control. I should tell the police. Listen, my uncle is... Yes, I know your family tree. Call your housekeeper who works for Ragaa, she'll help us. What will we tell the police? We took a million pounds. It might be drug money or laundered. - You didn't hear anything in their car? - Yes, I overheard them in the car talking about some man and saying they gave us the case by mistake. But I don't remember the man's name. Yes, Khamis Al Halawani, he's a carpenter. Great, good job! No, I think his name is Khamis Al Najar and he's a confectioner. A confectioner who sells western sweets in the East. Or eastern sweets in the West. No, they didn't talk about his business exactly. You're sure his name is Khamis? Khamis or Jomaa, one of them. Khamis or Jomaa. Don't worry, Ramzi. We'll find them. - We don't even know his name. - No. We should return the money now, because if we don't, we're dead. - How are you? - I'm great. I signed a contract with a food supplier who'll provide us with food for ten years, and a contract with an architect who'll build an extension to the dog's shelter, - and I paid all our debts. - That's really great. I wanted to ask you, did you spend all of my donation? - No, rest assured. - God bless you. It was more than enough for that. Look what we did with the rest. We're screwed. There's a small problem, sir. - What is it, son? - The owner of the money, her name's Ivone. What about her, son? - Ivone Tawadros. - What's the problem? Ivone Tawadros Armanios. - I don't see the problem. - Benyamin Hanania. Son, we don't discriminate between the donors and the receivers. At the end, we're all the sons of God. Honestly, I thought about the pros and cons, and weighed them against each other. I'll pay 50,000 pounds and take back the rest. You'll pay 50,000 and receive five million blessings. Mrs. Ivone. - Hi, sir. - Do you know what her job is? A stripper. God prevent us from evil. - Do you know what a stripper is, sir? - No, but since you're talking this way, I imagine it's something shameful. I don't think you could have spent all that money overnight. Son, we stayed up till dawn, - and made a start. - Started what? RAMZI SON OF ANGIE FOR THE POOR AND THE ORPHANS See, son? We've already started the project. Whoever donates something has the right to keep ten percent of its value. Why, son? Do you need it? Mrs. Ivone. I don't get it, Leila. You're embarrassing us. - Talking to the man while he exercises? - It's normal, don't worry. Will your dad give you a million pounds? How? He'll give me the money the second I ask him. He borrowed money for the buffet. Mrs. Souad is chasing him. He hasn't paid the association for two months. Fine, we'll tell the police. Congratulations. We found your car, but unfortunately, the radio and fire extinguisher have been stolen. That's not my car, sir. We're here about a briefcase. The briefcase? Yes, madam. We found the stolen book, and we found the card inside it, - like you said. - I didn't lose a book, sir. I'm kidding, I know who you are. I like to break the ice because we're all so stressed at work. The money you donated has saved Egypt from a big danger. This mob is one of the biggest mobs threatening Egypt's national security. But thanks to you, we've been able to put an end to its activities. - Egypt thanks you. - No need to thank us, sir. Any honest citizen would've done it for their country. On the contrary, he would've taken the briefcase and ran. They're thieves. I'm kidding. We're stressed at work. By the way, are we in danger? What's that, son? I'm the one talking, sir. I have a deep voice, I'm sorry. Danger? Not at all. Leila, you and Ramzi did the country a big favor. That's why you'll just be witnesses in this case, like witnesses at a wedding. I'm just kidding. We're so stressed at work. Sir, do we pay witnesses, or do we just say, "Thank you"? Are you asking about something, Ramzi? No, sir, she wanted to talk. All right, we better leave now, Officer. Why do you deepen your voice whenever I talk to you? I'm not, sir. That's her voice. Yes, her. Unfortunately, you can't leave, because the case isn't closed yet. You're going to be charged with impersonating someone, contempt of religion, dissipation of public funds, trespassing and damaging public property... I know, sir, because you're stressed at work. What about the mob? Because you spent all the money in the briefcase, there's no evidence against the mob. But we won't give up, Ramzi. We won't sleep so as to keep you safe. Police officers will follow the mob 24 hours a day, until we uncover something important against them. Thank God. But you parked on Talaat Harb Street, - the fine is 40 pounds. - But that's unfair. No, no violence. Listen, Leila. There's nothing in the world like a father's affection. Murad! Get off the machine and focus on me. Murad, I said I need money! Dear, I can't hear you. I need you to give me money! I need a million pounds! A million pounds? Did you need to come here for that? You could've just called me. I don't get it. I don't know why you're all staring. She's just a daughter who needs money from her dad. A million? How do you want it? In twenties or fifties? How about a check? What do you mean, please? Are you conspiring with him? Do you think I'm a fool? Take the bar! Why do you need the money? - To set up the apartment. - What? You have an apartment? No, I need another million pounds to buy the apartment. Good job, Murad! You're a beast! One more move, come on! Listen to me, please. When I put the bar down, you put the bar down, too. Are you done? It's like a haunted gym and you're the ugly ghosts. Should I hold them by myself? I understand my daughter asking me for money. But what about you? I was hoping you'd give me this small amount now and deduct repayments from my salary over the next 15 years. It's a small calculation. If you deduct 70 percent of my salary, and I work 24 hours a day, it'll take... Thirteen years and two months. I don't like those two months, make it 14 years. No, it's too much, Mr. Murad. I'm not surprised that you're asking me for money, Ramzi, but that you're so sure you'll still be working at my company in 14 years' time. You'll be dismissed from the company tomorrow morning. Here. Hold them behind me, then leave. Honestly, Murad, I don't need the money for the apartment, but for something else very important. Yes, go ahead, tell me. - Why do you need a million pounds? - Isn't that the penguin dance? Imagine, Murad, that a mob will kidnap us if we don't give them the money. A mob is asking for money and if they don't get it, they'll kidnap you? What I know... is that any self-respecting mob kidnaps first, then asks for money. - Is your dad crazy? - Why? What did he do? - We're waiting for you, sir. - Really? Don't tell me Leila's inside. No, she's waiting outside for you to get the money. Listen, son. I feel bad, there's something I've been hiding. - Leila is totally crazy. - So what should I do? What should you do? Nothing. Go. Run. Sir, I... Sir! - Let's go, he's not listening to you. - My dad's like that. He acts out a bit then gives me the money. He said he was going to take a shower. What shower, Leila? Your dad ran away. No way, my dad wouldn't run. Are you crazy? There he is. By the way, I can get 3,000 pounds. You can get the rest. If you sold me and my entire family in the flea market, you wouldn't get 3,000 pounds. We should find out what the money was for and then do what they want. That money was paid for something big and bad. It's a million pounds, do you know what that means? Since you know what a million pounds means, why did you give it to dogs? First, don't you dare touch Leila Murad, you jerk. That's rule number one. Number two, you're not reasonable enough to listen to me. I won't answer you. I shouldn't waste my energy insulting you. What will you tell him when he comes back? I don't know, but we have to do something before one o'clock. What time is it now? One o'clock. - Where are we, Ramzi? - What is this place? This mob must be serious. This place is really weird. Who's that man over there? These people are Buddhists? God forbid. - Why is he in the water? - They're infidels or atheists. You're enlightening us. He's a human being. Please, don't let them hurt me, Ramzi. Sit tight. If he knows we're not criminals, he'll set us free. Humor him, we should show him we have good intentions. Right, better than being hung. - Hung? - Yes, hung upside down and swung. Talk to him, since you know what to do. - I don't know what to do. - Let me ask you a question. Why take the money if you couldn't handle it? What do you mean, "couldn't handle it"? Ask yourself. I still didn't get nougat. - What? - I didn't get nougat. - That idiot wants nougat? - Stop. I think he's talking about drugs. The nougat is safe. It'll be here in 24 hours. They've tightened security over the last few days and we've lost our men. They even caught our bosses, Zangour Al Etr and Hobel. - How do you want your nougat? - What do you mean? I mean, we have standard nougat and nougat with nuts, you choose. - Seems you can't handle the nuts. - You'll hurt your teeth. Listen, you two. - I want nougat now, or else... - Sir, we'll get your nougat in 24 hours. I'm sorry if anything happened to you. Those people are dangerous. They wouldn't leave the staff alone until they got your number. Why did that man come to our table in the first place? I don't know, sir. But an hour before you arrived, there was a fight. A man was sitting at your table. There was a man with him who spoke in a very strange manner. I didn't understand a word he said. It was the man who said "Don't a-go-nize him". Why did they beat this man? I don't know, sir. They took him to the parking lot and beat him hard. We sent him to the hospital. He's badly injured. First, he came and beat up a man, then he came and gave us money. We can call the police, sir. No, no need for the police, it's a small matter. Can you give me the address of the hospital? EGYPTIAN RED CRESCENT HOSPITAL If they discover we're not doctors, we'll go to jail. What else can we do? Visitors aren't allowed and we don't know this man. I need you to chill out, 'cause if we're caught, we're screwed. Dr. Manar, do you see it? I see it, Dr. Isawi. When you put an X-ray up to the light, the picture becomes lighter. You... This seems to be a serious case. God help us. When was the last time you took a bath? What does that have to do with my shoulder? I mean, you can't take a bath because you can't turn the tap because of your shoulder. I've been like this for a week. In that case, Doctor, we should prescribe a portable tap. I'll prescribe you a good drug. Go and get this from the pharmacy, quick. - Yes, Doctor. - Thank you, Doctor. You're welcome. Good evening, guys. The patient who came in yesterday from a restaurant, someone sent him a briefcase. A briefcase. I like this, wait. A briefcase! - Ragab El Atar. - Yes, that's what I said, Ragab El Atar. There's no Najar or Halawani or Khamis in his name. I didn't say Khamis. Someone gave us a briefcase thinking we were you. What do they want from you? Maybe this is not letting him talk. Fifty-fifty, or else I won't say a word. So? What? What's this? This is it? Yes, it hurts, or yes, that's him? That's him. Nougat is a child and they want to kidnap him? - Yes. - Let's go. How did they put this in, feisty? Come on, take your medicine now. Drink it from the straw. Good job. - Leila. - No. Listen to me. Listen, Ramzi, there's no way I'm going to kidnap a child, even if they kill me. Are you crazy? If we let someone else kidnap him, no one knows what they'll do to him. We'll kidnap him, give him to them, then tell his parents and the police. We'll save him and save ourselves from being hung upside down. I won't let anyone hang me upside down. - Do you know what that means? - No. - Just shut up. - So what do we do now? He has training now. Let's go. This way, Doctor Manar. ONLY GUARDIANS ARE ALLOWED TO ATTEND TRAINING There's the kid. I'm sorry, only guardians are allowed in here. Yes, sir. I'm here to register my son so that he can play with these kids. - Where is he, madam? - Here. - Really? - Yes, sir, his body kept growing but his mind stopped developing when he was five. - Here's Ramadan. - Who's Ramadan? Ramadan Abou Al Alamin. - He fell down. - Oh my God! - Four chicks and a chicken. - No one understood a thing. - Does he have a uniform? - Yes, many uniforms. - Mister, mister! - Yes, stop. Stop it, behave! Mom is a cow! Sorry, when he's excited, he does it unintentionally. Fine, get him changed and come back. I'll kill you, Ramzi, I swear. What are you doing? What are you wearing? It's the training uniform of Mr. Karam Kaber. Who's Karam Kaber? He's not here, this is a Judo class, son. - Bouzou. - What's Bouzou? Hey, Said! Get him a uniform! - Go with this man, son. - Okay. Good, a bit harder. Go and sit over there. Come with me, I'm going to explain something. I'm going to teach you something. - I have measles. - No, you're fine, you can take it. Look, kids. I'll explain something and then we'll learn it all together. Where are you going? Come here. No, stop! - My body hurts. - It's fine. Thank you, Coach. Keep it together. - I'm so tired! - Get well soon. Why is he so weak, madam? Let him be a man like his friends. It's okay, Doctor, he's a mama's boy. Keep it together. If he's in pain, we can get him Voltaren for pain relief. Yes, no problem, but please, Doctor, he doesn't know how to swallow pills. Can you inject him? No, Doctor. I don't want an injection, I'm fine. Don't worry, I have something better than an injection. I have this. What? Wow! It's a suppository! What? No, Doctor, I don't want a suppository. No, you should take it. - No, Doctor! - Turn around. No, Doctor, I don't want it! - Turn around. - What are you doing? - Come on. - Mom! - Calm down, darling. - No, Doctor, no! Enough. Stop crying. - Work with me, boy. - Enough, stop it! He's stubborn, madam. I'll leave the suppository here, and leave you alone with him. Excuse me, madam. You want to give me a suppository? Why don't you want to take the suppository, Ramzi, and be a good boy? - Do it now. - What? Aren't you here to kidnap me? Do it. But I want 20 percent of what you'll get. Don't worry, darling, we'll tell the police and you'll be safe. Police? You're going to get me in trouble. - Just kidnap me and don't worry. - He's an odd boy. Quick, before Mom gets here! Are you new at this? Honestly, yes. Let's go, son. Enough, stop. Enough of your shit! Such a shitty encounter. Come on, walk quickly. "Walk quickly." Why are you talking like that? - Where's the car? - There, blind woman. - Move, we have to get out of here. - Let's go. - What? - Look. The man of the hour! Take the boy, here he is. - Here he is. - You look good. You're to have nothing more to do with this boy, understand? - Yes, sir. - Leave now. Thank you. Ramzi, I didn't understand a single word he said. He was talking like this. Most importantly, this nightmare is over. I don't know you and you don't know me. I don't talk to you and you don't talk to me. - I mourn the time I spent with you. - It was very unfortunate to meet you. I hope I never see you again. It was a pleasure, Leila. For me, too. Hey, kid! You dropped your pants! What a day! My body hurts. May you be damned, Murad, your daughter and Hanoun, too. May you all die on the same day. This nightmare is finally over, thank God. - Where's the kid? - You're kidding. No! No! No, No! Thanks, pal. Are you crazy, people? Didn't you take the kid? What did you do to him, you villains? Why are you slandering us? We didn't touch him. Why has no one touched him? You should've hanged him upside down. Ramzi Al Dousouki, also known as "Ramzi of the Plugs". - What? - I liked electricity when I was a kid. How did two losers like you fool someone like me, take a million pounds, and then lose it? I told you, sir, we kidnapped the kid and gave him to your man. - So where's the kid now? - In his villa, sir. See? In his villa, which means he's not with me. Give us a second chance and we'll get him here in two hours. No. One of you will go and the other will stay here with us. Mister! Can I go, please? Okay, I don't mind. But if you take more than an hour... we'll kill Ramzi. What guarantee do I have that you'll kill him? - You dirty woman! - So you're not a couple? I thought you were. Really? How could I date that imbecile? He kidnaps kids. Sorry, no offense. Today. He'll be here, today. Either Nougat is brought here and I forget everything, or he's not brought here... and nothing good will happen. Who are you? We're Mickey Mouse, can't you tell? We're not Mickey Mouse, we're Minnie Mouse. - Who's she? His sister or his wife? - Wife, we're Mickey's wives. - Where's Donald Duck? - Donald Duck? We asked for Donald Duck. Someone's getting the costume from the car. He'll be a bit late. - Wait outside. - Can we wait inside? I don't want any trouble, wait outside. - He's very weird. - Where can we get Donald Duck? What? This isn't a fancy-dress party. We're the only ones wearing costumes. You tricked me. Dad, you didn't give us any money, so you have to help us somehow. Must I be humiliated doing it? Can't I do it with some dignity? You won't be humiliated, Dad. Just do some of the moves you used to do at my birthdays when I was a kid. Should I sing to you, then? Put the mask on quickly. If anyone here knows you and sees you like this, they'll think badly of you. You're right. Let's go. Donald Duck is here, kids! My God! Donald Duck is here, but why are they running towards us? Come on, kids, come and sit down. What do we do now, Ramzi? We should do an act. - What act? - Any act. I prepared something for the kids. Hopefully they'll like it. Do you think, enemy of God, that Salah al-Din would kill the one who God forbids, unless guilty? Yes, sir, I think he would. He's Salah Al Din! - How? Why? As he is? - What? Think you not is him? I don't know why I feel that's a good sentence, but the words aren't in order. Esmeralda, dear, don't you want to say anything? Let me tell you something, honey Don't give me leukemia, dummy Let me tell you something, honey Listen and look at me, sonny. I'm giving a speech about Salah Al-Din, and you sing about leukemia? Dad, you told me to change the tone of my voice. Where's the kid we're kidnapping? - Kidnapping? Kidnapping who? - Don't mind him, Dad, he's silly. - Let's party and dance. - Drum roll please! Ramzi, there he is. - Where's the kid? - I don't know. I saw him come in here. Let's check upstairs. - Fine. - Arabi! Come, quick! Arabi! - Was someone in here? - No. Let's check. - I think it's the guard. - Damn it! - Let's look for the kid. - This way! - They're coming. - Quickly. - Where? - Over there, quickly. God help us. God help us. What? I don't understand what you're saying. - Me neither. - You're an idiot, Ramzi. Calm down. Sounds like they've gone, let's go. Ramzi, what are we going to do? - We should get... - What's that smell? - Did you fart? - Me? I haven't eaten since this morning. - What is it? - It's just a lion. We should find the kid fast... Come with me, easy, this way. - Don't look him in the eye. - I won't. Walk calmly and quickly. Don't look him in the eye. No eye contact. - At all. - I'm not, I swear. Easy. Easy, easy, easy. Thank God we found his brother outside. Come with me. Ramzi? Ramzi! Are you having a stroke? Let's go. This way. Ramzi. - What now? - I don't know, Ramzi. Let's stay here. - Call your dad. Tell him to come save us. - Where's my phone? - He got up! He's coming! - Leila! - Easy, Ramzi! - Call your dad, quick! - I'm not going down. - Calm down, Ramzi. I'm not going down! I don't want to die! Stop it, Ramzi. Lower your voice. Fine. Stop. Damn you, Ramzi! Ramzi, I'm as scared as you are! I'm as scared as you are, Ramzi! Stop it! Hands off me! Don't look at him, Ramzi! Look up, idiot! Look up! - You're so stupid, Ramzi! - I'm a stupid idiot! Don't put your hands on me, Ramzi! Don't shout! Stop screaming! Stop screaming, you fool! He opened his mouth, Ramzi! He opened his mouth! He'll eat you first! Stop it, Ramzi! Stop! I've been wanting to go to the restroom for an hour now. You'll die before you get to the restroom. Don't be so stupid. This lion is very nice. By the way, it's a male but it's bald. So what? Should I kiss its head 'cause it's bald? There's no such thing as a bald male. - A bald lion is called a lioness. - Never mind. Ramzi, I need to tell you something. We're both on top of the closet. Something seems off. All my married or engaged friends, in a moment of romance or boldness, they might, for example, climb a tree. Climb a tree? My friends go behind the tree. These friends of yours are so weird. Tell you what, call your dad and get him to come and save us from this shit. Don't tell him there's a lion here or he'll run. Fine, I'll call him. You keep telling me to call him. We're relaxed here. - Lola. - Murad. - Enjoy your meal. - What? We can escape while the lion eats him. Where are you, Leila? Oh my God! You tricked me and left me playing with kids downstairs, so you could be alone with my daughter, you jerk? You know... No, no! No! It's okay, Mr. Murad. I thought he'd just eat you. I didn't know he'd want to mate. - I knew. - What? - I couldn't fight him off. - Tell me what happened exactly. He approached me. I thought he'd just smell me. I didn't know he'd be so determined. What? It's a lioness. It's a lion. You, again? What are you doing here? Simba! Go, now. What are you doing up there? - Why do we find you everywhere? - I have nothing to do with them. I was wearing a Donald Duck costume. I was very much in character. You can ask the kids, they had so much fun with him. I wanted to pee, like any normal human being. But it was a wrong decision, because... He wasn't human. He was a beast. Come down. - You're blessed. - The kid is here in the villa. Find a way to get him so that we can leave. You're driving me crazy! What are you saying? Call your boss, now! - Go! - Yes, sir. Ramzi! Sabir! Sabir! Sabir! Sabir. - Please, cover yourself. - Come, cover me. - Who are you? - I'm lost. - Lost? How can I find you? - Look for me in the sun. Getting close to the sun will burn you. Burning for the sake of justice is right. Mr. Right is too young for this. - Fartaka. Fartaka. - Drums rolling in As Saksakah. Let me go now. Sabir! Sabir! Rightness, light and wisdom. Ombola! Ombola! Ombola! This is how it is! Ombola! Ombola! This is how it is! Ombola! Ombola! This is how it is! No! No! This is how it is! Ramzi! Ramzi. Ramzi. Ramzi! This man won't stop? This time, he sent someone cute. - Where did he find you? - In Damietta, dear. There's such cuteness in Damietta? And dumbness, too. These are the people who want to kidnap my son. If you were in my shoes, what would you have done? We would uncuff us and set us free. Yaser! Come with me so we can figure out what to do with them. That thing you do with your lips is so vulgar. Try to get free. Ramzi! Untie me, Ramzi, I need to go pee. I'll push you, do it in the "bool". "Bool"? Help me! He calls the pool, "bool"! Forty percent and I'll untie you. - Okay, dear. - Fine. - Come and untie us. - Come on. After that, Uncle Ramzi can sit in the "bool" for a while. - Let's go, dear. - Untie me. - No, it's fine. - Come on, Nougat. - Play in the "bool". - Leila! Leila! - Come here, Leila! - Walk quickly. Leila! You're more agile, seems the diet is working. Ramzi. I don't know how to get out, escort me out. Uncut me fast. "Uncut me"? Why do you speak like that? So weird! "Uncut me." You're so vulgar, "bool" and "uncut me"? You were going to leave me? Let's go. - Fine. - Let's go. Get in, fast. Let's go. Come on, son. - Good evening, sir. - Drive, quick. - Do you want me to turn the radio on? - Not now! Drive! The rickshaw has a Wi-Fi service. What? Really? What's the password? Drive, man! - Can you share the location on WhatsApp? - Yes, sure, right away. Is there no one here? - What is it? - My God! Is this guy possessed or what? Why can't we get rid of you? Listen, I'm not going to give him to you anymore. Tell Aman that Nougat is here. I don't know what you're talking about. Who's Nougat, anyway? You don't want the kid? What kid? You think this is an orphanage? Leave now! If this gate wasn't here, I'd kick your ass. No, I'm kidding. - Leave now! - Yes, sir. - Leave now! - Yes, sir! Go! What a pity! I wish he had opened the gate to kick your ass. Shut up! Who are these crazy people? - I feel for this opportunistic kid. - He said he didn't want the kid. Drive him home, then me, and let's be done with it. Drive you? What am I supposed to do about that genie? If I go to your house, I'll find him there, waiting for me. Listen. We should find somewhere to hide until we figure out what to do. Let's go, son. Kidnap? Seriously? Mobs and kidnapping? Do I look like a kidnapper to you? Mrs. Khouloud insists that you're behind all this. Khouloud? Yes! Khouloud is a bored woman who looks for a little action in her life. Here's my house, search it if you want. - Want a drink? - No, thanks. - Want an apple? - No, thanks. Your friend's neighborhood is very nice. - Can you smell the true Egyptian soil? - That's poo. This smell is killing me, Ramzi. - Seems like we'll die here then. - I'm suffocating. - Don't breathe. - Hello, sir. - Why isn't he answering? - He's dead. - So weird. - Be careful. - Be careful. - Flat butt. - He said, "flat butt"! - He didn't, you're hearing things. - I'll beat him up! - He didn't say anything. Won't you tell us who it is that wants to kidnap you? - How much will you pay if I tell you? - Get in. How are you, Ramzi? What's this? Come in, guys. Ramzi, I saw your friend's undershirt. God have mercy. Your spit didn't hit me, by the way. I didn't have time to clean the apartment. You took me by surprise. Clean what, dude? This apartment needs to be burned. What? Are you Tariq, son of Tariq, the grocery store owner? Welcome, guys. You didn't seem to be wealthy at the office. The wheel of fortune has turned in your favor. We're not wealthy, Ramzi, we're still poor. Tell you what, I want to leave this kid here with you. Take good care of him until we can give him to them, report them and be done with it. Yes, I'll take good care of him, but where's the kid? Didn't we come in here with a kid? I told you it's a dangerous neighborhood. They won't leave a rich kid like him alone, they'll kidnap him. They'll kill us, man! Where's the kid? - Don't worry, I'll handle it. - I told you, Leila, to watch... Now where has she gone? How many times do I have to tell you to be careful? Close the door or you'll vanish, too. Nougat! - They took the kid? - Those assholes took him from me. May God punish them! Is he your son? No, woman, I kidnapped him. May he return safely to you. Bring the kid and come here, Ramzi. Damn you! Didn't you say you didn't want him? You want to drive me crazy? No more chitchatting. Bring Nougat here now. We have to do whatever it takes to get the boy back, Muhab. I was wrong to rely on you for something like this. Calm down, Ramzi. I know where they take stolen things in this area. The kid is with Barani. Barani is the most dangerous man here. He's a thief and a criminal. You can't negotiate with him. His only weakness is he's kinky and likes sexy people. Kinky and likes sexy people. What? Why are you looking at me like that? He said the man is kinky. - You sacrifice yourself. - What? Have him "look but don't touch" till we find the boy. "Look but don't touch" is as vulgar as you are. I knew you were a low-life, but not this low. This is how it is. Don't be scared, I won't leave you. You want the kid to be lost, and us, too? Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! One, two, three Come on, God be with us Don't make us go crazy Come on, God be with us Don't make us go crazy We fight, we make up Every now and then, you start a fight We fight, we make up Every now and then You start a fight We fight, we make up We fight, we make up Come on, God be with us Don't make us go crazy Come on, God be with us Don't make us go crazy If you want to play with me Then let's play Let's dance Play with me, dear Play with me, dear Play with me, dear Good day, sir. I'm Mr. Orani, also known as Mr. Comb. Comb? Because you style your hair? Leila Makeup also known as Moudina. Welcome. I heard you were having a party, so I brought this lady here with me to have some fun. You came at the right time. Guys, I'm going to call it a night, see you later. Let's go, come on. You beauty! Welcome, come in. Come in, Mr. Comb. Such a handsome man! Welcome. Leave us alone. What will happen now, Comb? Mister. Shouldn't we agree first, mister, before I leave? Where are you going? She's leaving. - Why is she leaving? - Make her leave. - Why? - You're the one who caught my eye. You... You're so handsome. What's wrong, Ramzi? Seems this man is gay. - I like him a lot, he's nice. - Kinky! That asshole Muhab! That's what he meant. Let's leave. No, why leave? I'll look for the kid, and you make him "look but don't touch" till I find the boy. I won't let him look or touch. Don't be scared, I won't leave you. You want the kid to be lost and us, too? - May he die today! - What's wrong? Come on, Ramzi. The ball is in your court. - Bye, Barani. - No ball will enter my court! My court will stay clean forever! I'm telling you this! What's wrong? Why are you stressed? You think we're the only ones? No! There are lots of men like us. Yes, I know. You know what's a sin without question? - What? - Chantilly cream. If I give you 80 percent, will you get me out of here? Such an opportunistic kid! - Ramzi. - You found him? Yes, I found him. I found this one, too. Where will you handcuff us, sir? Come on. - Find something to cut us loose. - Stop whining, man. I don't get why you're so happy when you're kidnapped. I'm happy when I see two people in love like you, - not like Mom and Dad. - What? Cute kid. Mom is only keeping me with her to annoy Dad. Dad wants to kidnap me every day to annoy Mom. Whenever I'm with him, he just plays with his girlfriends and ignores me. Who's your dad who wants to kidnap you? Aman, the guy who sent you to kidnap me. - What? Aman is your father? - You didn't realize that? Wait a second. Your dad wants to kidnap you to annoy your mom? - Yes. - What is this bullshit? Come here, now. - Come here, right now. - Stop it, Ramzi. Easy, he's a child, it's not his fault. Easy? I've been to hell and back for three days because of a crazy couple? - It's normal. - The boy is Naji Aman Naji. They call him Nougat! You punched me? You'll pay for that. That's my phone. Tell him what I tell you to say. Mr. Aman, we've been kidnapped, sir. Tell him I want a million pounds for the kid. Barani says he wants a million pounds for the kid. Then? - Tell him I'll send him the location. - He'll send you the location. - Tell him not to be late. - Don't be late. - Tell him to take care. - You take care. Hello? Mrs. Khouloud, everything is going according to plan. The kid's father is coming. Bye. Men, the lady is coming here to give and receive. After that, a quick escape or it's prison bars. You'll stay here until this heavy weight is lifted. Come with me, kid. I can't lift any heavy weights, by the way. The heavy part is what Hogan and John Cena are going to do to us. Welcome. What's with you? Every time I see you, I find you handcuffed? Why do you go to the gym and work on your six pack if you won't use it? I only have one pack, not six. Should I leave you two alone? It's a shame. But what can I do about Aman and his petty little games? These are family issues, madam. It's none of our business. You were seen entering the villa. It's good that you're here. When Aman comes here, I'll get rid of all of you at the same time. Yaser, I'm going to check on Nougat. Cut them loose. I don't want the police to find them handcuffed. - Don't let them escape like last time. - Yes, madam. Didn't I tell you? - What? Did you step on my Abaya? - I didn't, woman. Since we got on the bus, you haven't stopped harassing me. You jerk! Someone should teach you a lesson! Do you know who you're punching? I'll show you something. - Can't we hang him upside down? - No, we can't. Help me! We'll make you pay for what you did to us! Are you with him or with her? I'm with you, I swear. Wait a second, I need to understand one thing. Why do we see you everywhere at the same time, like Bayoumi Fouad? Where's the kid? Oh my God! My brother, assholes! What? Is there more than one version of this guy? - Are you okay, Yaser? - I'm fine, thank God, and you? I'm fine, thank God. Come on, Yaser, let's find them. - Let's go. - Ramzi. I feel bad for the kid, I want to go back. His mom and dad are there, and the police. His mom and dad? His mom called the police to catch his dad in the act of kidnapping his son. They're crazy. I should tell the police about this. May they all die! Should I get myself killed for a kid? If you go there, you'll get caught. It's our only chance to run. If you're such a coward, then go. Stay here then, brave woman, but don't mention me. - I'll jump! - Come down, kid. We'll come to you. If someone comes here, I'll jump. No, stay where you are. Don't be scared. He's not scared, we are! Come down, Nougat. We'll talk about what's bothering you. I don't want to talk to you, and I don't want to live with you. - If someone gets close to me, I'll jump. - See what you've done? What I've done? This is your fault! You send weird people to kidnap him. You've made him go crazy. If you ever let me see him, I wouldn't have needed to. You're an irresponsible man! What's wrong with you? Your son is trying to kill himself. Nougat, come down, please. Weren't you saying I'm better than your mom? Come down, please, for me. I'll jump! I don't want to live with them! Fine, you can come and live with me. I want to live with you and Ramzi. I'll come down if you get married. Fine, dear, we'll get married now. Come down, please. - Promise? - I promise. Nougat! I'm sorry, Officer. We recently divorced, and you know how silly women are. Yes, but it was a fake call. Forget it, Officer, and I'll compensate you. - What are you saying? - I mean we'll make a statement. I'll drop into the station later. Thank God it's over. - Thank God. - Goodbye. Goodbye, thank you. - Let's go home, Nougat. - No, I want to stay with Leila and Ramzi. No, dear, you can't. You have to go with your mom and dad. Your mom won't fight with your dad anymore. We'll come and visit you. Let's go. I feel like you'll never change. I'll change for you, sexy. - Ramzi, I feel like crying. - I feel like shouting. What? Your voice sounds like mine now. You mustache looks like shit. - Let's leave. - Come on. All right. I don't know you, you don't know me? I don't talk to you and you don't talk to me? Seems it's true this time, Ramzi. By the way, I'll miss the way you say "Ramzi". - What day is it today? - Saturday. The weekend went by fast. You know... I'm sad because I have to go into work tomorrow. You don't need anything? All right, I'll get out. Leila, I'm thinking about changing my banking job. I've been working in the same position since I graduated. I've wanted to open my own business for years. I'd be the manager. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to order some food? No, I'm not hungry. Why are you sitting here? - What's wrong? - Leave! Do you know me? - We said, leave. - Leave or we'll kick your ass. What do you want? - Are you an idiot? - Fine. - Go! - Fine, what is it? - You didn't like the food? - Tell me... - Tell me... - Get up! - Tell me, what's... - Get up! At your service, man. And you, don't upset him. You know what? Upset him. What are you doing here? Didn't you say, "I don't talk to you and you don't talk to me"? First of all, I didn't say it in that tone. I said it in a normal way. Second, I figured I wouldn't find another woman who would call me "Ramzi", nor one who would do what you did with me. I'd never find another woman as feisty as you. He was eating meat, by the way. Yes, and I reprimanded him for that. Listen, let's agree on this once and for all. I will eat meat, on a skewer, too. Do you like it on a skewer? No, not on a skewer. - You'll eat meat on a skewer, Leila. - No way. On a skewer with onions. - Not on a skewer with onions, Ramzi. - No, I'm telling you... Was that your friend? - Wasn't he your friend? - I don't know him. What, then? Will you open the briefcase, Ramzi? Let's see what's inside. God help us. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
