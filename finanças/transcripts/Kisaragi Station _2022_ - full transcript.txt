There is a private high school near here. My older brother asked me to take care of her while he was going there, so we're on good terms lol Tsutsumi was a student, wasn't he? Eh, majoring in folklore I hid the theme of my graduation thesis, but something I just feel like I've seen it somewhere before so interview me no one has seen I want to write something new that doesn't exist there are many people like that But in the end it's half teasing A lot of people don't believe me fine We exchanged emails many times. I thought I could trust Mr. Tsutsumi lol Hayama-san, can I ask you a question? January 8, 2004 The story of how you went to another world I was late at work that night, so I had to take the last train home. I went to the nearest station, Saginomiya Station. I asked her brother to pick me up. JR is job hunting There should be no tunnel, so there is a train there's a story I don't know what happened at that time. The train was running in a place I didn't know. three young men and women and girls Five high school students were sleeping in the conductor's room I didn't see inside because the curtains were closed Wake up and you I'm a student of Hamako Elementary School. be big I'm sorry sokokohasan I'm a little older Where is this? If everyone is puzzled by this situation, That person arrived at a station with a train. After Soan what is this Kisaragi Station Is that why you got off? I thought I passed it, but yeah I've never heard of it either no I've never heard of it, and it's Kisaragi and Kacchan wait i can't go back No more trains I asked my wife I don't understand Um, do you know where the toilet is? Is that all right?

After a quick fever, I'm thirsty Are you okay and me too That Miyazaki went out with the students, wondering if there was any other means of transportation.
