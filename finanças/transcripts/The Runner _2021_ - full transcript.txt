Wake up, Aiden. I said wake up... I said wake up, goddamn it! That's right. Hey, that's my fucking shit! You need a warrant to be in here. No, we don't need a warrant, Aiden. We've got a good old-fashioned open invitation, kiddo. - Detective Wall? - What you got, Burrel? Look at that. That's a grown-up bag of coke, young man. See, I'm a tad out of touch. Not so sure what the kids are into much these days. Why don't you clarify for me? This here, uh... this here strictly for personal consumption? You dealing, Aiden? Because in this fine state, that crime carries with it - a mandatory minimum... - Of ten years. Shit! Ten years! Goddamn, Aiden, that's a long time. Does it look like I have to waste my time selling? Hmm, Detective? Maybe on your salary, but, uh... I get it now. You know, maybe you're looking for a little... A little something to help with the kids' college savings. You watch your mouth, kid. I'm onto something, right? How about you guys tell me what the fuck you want, so you can leave me the fuck alone, huh? Well, if you insist. - Officer Burrel? - Yes, sir. Tag the evidence and take it down to the car, please. Come on! You're not fuckin' serious, right? Aiden Albers, you're under arrest. - Let's... let's go. - Fuck you! Alright, alright. Get the fuck off of me! You have the right to remain silent... - Anything you say... - Fuck you! ...can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. Do you understand your rights as I've described them? Blow me. Let's go. Away we go, big guy! Fuck you! Alright, Aiden, this way. This way. You set this up? How fucking could you? I'm your son! I didn't know what else to do. Aiden, I'm sorry. - Mom. - Let's go. Let's go. Mom! Let's go. Come on, bro. Burrel! Got a runner. Hey, Mom. I'm running. I know. Me too. I need to be out the door, but I cannot find these development specs. Could you help me find them? Help you? Why would I know where you put your specs? Oh, here they are. Okay. I got them. Um, I got to catch my flight, but what are you having for dinner tonight? I can order you some delivery. No, I'm fine. I'll find something. But what about that burger place that you love so much? You know, with the chili fries? - Mom, I don't eat meat. - What? Mom, I'm vegetarian. Oh, come on, Aiden. Since when? For, like, years. Now, look, can I just go run? Well, just order the fries without the chili. - Mom... - You know what? You're so precious about this animal fat, but you'll put any goddamn thing into your body. - What? - Nothing. Nothing. Okay.

Yeah. It's not bad for an SUV. I would've went with the coupe. Got a problem, Caleb? Oh, I got all kinds of problems, Aiden. Do you have a problem? - Maybe just one. - Alright, alright. Cool out with all this bullshit. Yeah, yeah, we're cool. Just remember why we're here. So, y'all want something, or what? Heard you guys got that gym candy. - You serious, bro? - Did he fuckin' stutter? Yeah, he's serious. - Get the fuck outta here. - Nice. What's the matter, bro? What, my girlfriend's good enough for you, but my money isn't? The first right thing he said all fuckin' day. - He's hurt. - He's definitely hurt. - He's hurt. He's hurt. Look, man, I don't even know where to begin to get that shit, to be honest. I'm sure you guys can find it. You, uh... know where all that black market shit is, right? How about you guys take a fuckin' walk? Hmm? Relax, man. Alright? I'm gonna work on it. - No fuckin' promises, though. - There you go. I love the initiative, Brian. See you ladies tonight. Blake. Hey, Aiden... you better get that shit for us. You're actually gonna go to LL with that shit for Caleb? Why not? Steroids, Blake? Come on. Oh, now you want to get all high and mighty on me? Let's invite him to the party. - Who? - LL. - Get the fuck outta here. - I'm serious, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want Local Legend at your house? I been making him money for months. About time I meet him, right? No. I've been making him money. You've been watching my back, okay? So, let's... let's get that straight. Alright? I see how it is. So... I'm good enough to watch your back, but not meet your boy. - That's what it is, right? - No, no. That's not it, and you know that. So, what the fuck is it, then? Come on, you know this shit's gonna be lit. The whole fucking school's coming. He'll see what we bring to the table. He'll see where the fuck you live, man. Blake. Come on. Just make the ask. Let's see what happens. It's a bad fucking idea. There you go. Just have a little faith, bro. How we looking for tonight? Blake reached out to him, so we'll see if he bites. Listen, I'm just... Are you sure that we can... I'll get the wheels turning. Keep me updated. Same place and time. Don't be late. And stay calm. Yeah, I got it. - That was the kid? - Yeah. Yeah. SWAT's not gonna like the scramble this late in the game. For this, they'll make it work. What do you think's gonna happen to the kid? We'll see. I mean, that's above our pay grades. What, you... You feeling guilty? Maybe a little, yeah. I am. You know what? I'll be goddamned. I think you're right on this. Let's call it off. I don't want you losing sleep over this. You can tell the captain... Well, you can tell the captain that we decided to listen to our hearts. - Of course. - But, no, you're right. You're right. Let's turn our backs on the biggest potential bust this department has seen in over a decade, because you felt guilty... over a boy. A pathetic, contribution-less, opportunity-wasting boy, who, by the way, happens to be far older than plenty of other kids that have been pinched for the same crime, who have no safety net whatsoever. But you tell me... should we go on over and talk to the captain now? No, sir. Why don't we circle back to this little pow-wow after the operation, and depending on how things go, I'll have a talk with the captain about bumping you up to detective? Thank you, sir. Don't mention it. Fuckin' asshole. Wow. That's lots of booze. What are you having, like a baptism, a funeral, a wedding? - It's just a party. - You must be a popular guy. You got ID? Hmm.

I guess I never have to apologize for anything, then, right? Stop. I'm kidding. - Alright, come here. - No. Come here. Ah! I got you something. Hey. Do you like it? - You got me a necklace. - Yeah.

In two years, I'm onstage at Tisch, receiving a standing ovation for a small but pivotal role in a recent Tennessee Williams production. Mm-hmm. Wow. - In five years... - W-w-w-wait. So... you want to be an actor? Yeah... Walk in someone else's shoes. In five years, I'm bar tending at a hole in the wall in the Village, when I get a text from my manager that I've landed my first major film role. Mm-hmm. And in ten years, I am nominated for an Oscar, which I don't win, because Meryl is nominated, but that's totally fine, because at Elton John's party, she hugs me and says she loves me.

I actually had track practice, so, you know, didn't shower yet. So stupid to forget my passport. You want me to make you something to go like a snack or... I'll grab something on my way.

I'm so tired of you yelling at me. I don't know. That's the problem. So, how about you ask me a real fucking question, then, huh? I don't think you want me to ask you a real question. What is it you're dying to know? 'Cause it sure is better than you calling the cops on your own fucking son...! You were out of control, and I had no choice! - You had no choice? - No, I did not have a choice. - No fucking choice? - Yeah. - Where's my choice? - Because... - Where is mine, huh? - Stop yelling at me. Maybe if you just trusted me, just a little fucking bit. Because that has worked so well for us, Aiden? I mean, I cannot even keep track of how many times you have lied to me or stolen from me or raided my medicine cabinet. I have given you everything! And I am here by myself... Fuck! Okay?

Do you know what would happen if I tried to snatch up one of these birds? They'd fly away, Aiden. Do you know why that is? - Look, Wall... - Anticipation. A natural reaction. Observance of one's surroundings. But if it gets distracted, even for a second, by something so small as a bread crumb, I could snap its little neck before it ever knew what happened to him. Look... I know there's a lot riding on our shoulders tonight. "Our" shoulders? Yours are looking pretty light from where I'm sitting. I'm the one with my neck out. You're wrong, Aiden. It's both our necks. But us... we're just two tiny drops in a big ocean. You help me bring down this... This piece of shit tonight, and we get one step closer to taking down the entire operation. I won't have your behavior get in the way of that. - Fine. - I won't. Alright, these are my people. I know what to do. Your "people," Aiden? Aiden, these people are drains on society, scumbags not worth another thought. You? You could still do something with your life, have a real future. But tonight? Tonight, you're helping make this world a safer place. And that's what matters. Good talk. Update you later. I'll be listening. Take care, kid. Hey there, pal. Sounds like you're having fun in here. I want my lawyer. Guilty people want lawyers. You guilty, Aiden? Ha ha, funny, funny, funny, funny. Where'd you get that from? CSI, huh? You're right. That is funny, considering I got your ass ten times over. This morning... this morning was a... was a favor. Answering your cry for help. You took that favor, and you spit on it. We're just getting started, you piece of fucking shit. Oh, you sure are right about that, kiddo. You think the coke looks bad today? Huh? See, you got nothing. Yeah, I got you on tape, Aiden Albers. And that shit does not go away, no matter how much money you think you can throw at it. Bullshit. Your momma came in here today. You believe that shit? Begging me to scare some sense into you. Keep you out of prison, away from your junkie friends. Now, did I tell her that I have you on tape, buying drugs... Quit fucking playing, man. ...on three separate occasions? You see, Aiden, before today, you weren't worth the fucking paperwork. Spoiled little rich kid wants to fuck up his life? That's on him. Who gives a rat's ass? But after you decided to open that pretty little mouth of yours, I figured, "Hell, let me double-check those tapes." And it turns out there was a fourth occasion. And on said occasion, you weren't just buying for yourself. In fact, you even bragged about it. Now, that changes everything. You see, Aiden... I own you. You fuck, you waste. And you're gonna do exactly what I ask of you, because, right now, your future's looking pretty fucking dark. And if you ever want to see the light again, it's gonna be me leading you to it. You can't fucking do this. I'm doing it. I'm done, actually. You can either be tried as an adult or we can wipe the slate clean. Up to you, kiddo. What do you want? Oh, just, uh... everyone. Oh, look at this guy right here! Hey, buddy! - You need a ride? - I'm good. - Yeah, you're good. That's why you're gonna come up with what we talked about, right? Yeah, get us that juice, dawg. We're trying to win state's! Of course. Ooh, I can feel that burn. You're the fucking man. I'm so happy I don't have to break your face. - You got it. - Stay up, kid. You be safe out there on these streets, okay, G? Aiden. I'm sorry about earlier. I don't... I don't really know what that was. I haven't seen you in months. And then just out of nowhere, and you just take off like that? I, uh... I wanted to say hello... I wanted to, uh... I know that I'm probably the last person you want to hear from. And, uh... And what I... what I did can never be forgiven... but, um... I guess I just really wanted to see her. You know, I really miss her. She's different now. You know that, right? She's still her. Come here. Aiden. Layla... wow. Where have you been? I've, uh... made a bad choice. Apology accepted. Come on. I... I'm glad you're here. I... I want to play, and there's nobody to play with. Mommy's too busy. Sure. What do you want to play? Come see. This game is called "Someday." This is Mommy, and this is Daddy. They're married, and they love each other. They're mommy and daddy to a little girl named Rose. She's two and never, ever cries. She's very brave, even at night, when you shut the lights. Now, that is super brave. So... So, what do I do? Aiden, this is Someday. We can do whatever we want. We're the mommy and daddy. Right. Um, first, you come home, from work. A long day at the office. And... and you work so hard... taking care of the family. Layla, I can't... I can't play today. I'm gonna have to go away for a while. What? I wanted to tell you myself, 'cause... 'cause you might not see me much more. No... I don't want to, but I think I have to. - I think it's the only way... - You don't... you don't have to go anywhere. You just don't want to play with me. No, that's not true, Layla. So, why? Where are you going? When? I don't know. I... Soon. Maybe tonight. No! No...! I need you to know that I care about you so, so much. If you cared, you would stay with me. Stay and play Someday! Layla, please. Please don't cry. This is the worst day ever. I'm sorry. In 15 years, I'm celebrating my Golden Globe win and the cover of "People" magazine with a week at a private resort in the Maldives with husband number one, who may or may not be you.

Like, what's your picture? - I don't have one. - Aiden, this is Someday. I'm serious. I've... You know, I've always just taken one step in front of the other. I don't... I haven't thought about it. I don't know what I want. Because you don't take the time to ask yourself. Hmm? Okay. - But don't laugh. - Mm-mm. I might want to be a poet. A poet? - I told you, don't laugh. - I'm not laughing. Yeah, I mean, think about it. - It's... - Okay. You start off with something you can't touch... Mm-hmm. ...or really see, but it's... It's something you feel. It's real. Right? And every decision you take, whether big or small, it's... I mean... they're yours. And, sure, you might suck, and... and might not reach their expectations, but... but at the end of it, at the end of the day, it's... it's... It's touchable, it's see able, it's... It's you. It is you. It's beautiful. Stop. Hey, it's... Ah, it's whatever. It's... You know... they're just dreams, right? It's... It's never gonna happen anyways. Sometimes... I feel like I know you.

And I got the scholarship. Aiden? Did you hear me? That's, um... that's incredible, Liz. That's... that's so amazing. It's actually happening. And in the letter, they said I was a good candidate for work study too. It's real, bae. I actually did it. Aiden? Congrats. Are you okay? Come on. Let's celebrate. Okay. Get this shit started! We gonna party 'til the break of dawn! Exactly. You're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. - What's going on, man? - What's going on, man? - You alright? What up, pretty boy? How we doin'?

Yeah, yeah, for sure. But pleasure before business, right? You know, we're just... we're just poppin' it off back there. Kickin' back. - Kick back? - Yeah. You want us to kick back at your fuckin' high school party? Aiden! You fuckin' trippin', son? What the fuck, yo? What's wrong with your boy, yo? Yo, you need to get your head right, son. What's up with your girl, man? She want to dance and shit, right? Yo, Madonna want to dance and shit, right? What the fuck, yo? You ain't talking much now, huh? You want to kick it, you want to come correct, you want to fuckin' chill, a little pleasure before business? What kind of business you talking about, son? You want my fuckin' business? - Huh? - We're all good. We're all good. No, we ain't all good, son. We ain't all good at all, motherfucker. You understand what I'm saying? You... I'm just fucking with you, dude. He's joking. - He's joking. - Oh, man. - It's okay. It's okay. - Yo, dude... I grew up in, like, La gun a Hills, listening to, like, 311 and Incubus and shit. - He was joking. - Alright. Yeah. Yeah, you want to dance? Take your girl dancing, man. Alright. Well, Blake... A little business before pleasure. We can do that. Set him up. Enjoy, huh? - Come on. - Alright. It's okay. This is the best night ever. - I got to go. - What? Where? I'll be back. What do you... Okay. What are you doing here? Just keeping an eye on my favorite CI. The rest of the team is up on Elm. The rest of the team? Have you seen the target? Has the target made an appearance? Yeah. He's here. How many did he come in with? - What? - How many men is he with? Uh... - Three, four. Maybe four. - Okay, that's great. That's... that's good. You wired up? Yeah. I mean, no, but I was just going to. But you are fuckin' high, right? I mean, yeah. I am a little bit high. I mean, fuck it, it's a party, right? Of course I'm gonna be high. I'm getting tired of you giving me shit all the time, Wall. This might be your fucking case, but you got nothing without me, you get that? Fucking... Biggest fucking collar in my life, my goddamn CI isn't even wired up. You little piece of shit. I should have fucking... - I should have fucking... - Tha-tha-tha... Throw me, what, into fucking prison? At this point? A fucking safe haven for you. Because what that would mean, Aiden, is that you've only managed to fuck up your own little pathetic life, and not the lives of everyone around you. - No, no, this isn't my... - Do you get what this is about? Do you get it? Huh? This is about me, and fuck it, not everybody else. You think you don't pull this off and things just go back to the way they were, huh? Running around, chasing some college dorm room dealer to pinch? Kid, you throw this hail Mary even a yard short, and you can kiss it goodbye. Fuck you. Look, let me put it to you like this. If you don't deliver me this LL tonight, I mean, right fucking now, there's going to be major consequences. Fuck you! I've done everything you've fucking asked. What's that kid you're running around with... Blake, I think, is his name? Thinks you're his boy and that you got his back? You know how many times over I got him on possession, thanks to you? Wait, no, no. Fuck that. I got him on trafficking, dead to rights. He'll do 20 years, no parole, and I'll make goddamn well sure he fucking knows it was you that put him there. What's that little hot piece of ass? What's her name? The one you been running around with, what's her name, huh? What's her name? - Huh? - No, you fucking don't. I think an accessory rap might put a little damper on her plans, no? What do you think a record might do to her future? Don't need to prove it. Just the smell of smoke from a goddamn struck match in these colleges, they start looking elsewhere for their "leg up" candidates. - Fuck. - Okay. Okay, okay. Come here. Come here, come here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Look at you. Now, I'm going to need to hear you say it, Aiden. Come on, Aiden. - Say it. - I-I-I... Uh... uh... Say it. I-I don't... Fucking say it. I'm not... I won't... I'm not gonna fuck this up. Okay. Okay. See how simple that was? Now, you keep your head together, and your happy little pals just might get to keep their happy little lives. But that depends on you. Aiden... Aiden, Aiden, Aiden, Aiden. Stand up. Come on. I chose you because you're strong. You're stronger than this. Now, you know these guys. And you know what they want. But they don't have to know you. Now, you can hustle anyone. Am I right? - Yeah. - I know I'm right. Okay. Chin up, pull it together, and let's finish this. Okay? - Okay. - Look at me. Finish this. Let's go. Come on. I'm right here. Listen up. Target is Local Legend, a lieutenant for V Mob. V Mob runs drugs over state lines, across our sovereign borders. Legend and his muscle possess vital intel on how V Mob runs their organization. Our priority is to capture Legend. Without a house full of teenage hostages? Officer. You have something you want to contribute? Yeah, with all due respect, sir, there's a thousand ways this goes wrong. Unless you want to sit this one out, I advise you to do your job. Are we clear? Alright, gentlemen. Let's talk about entry points. Hey, man. Who the fuck are these people? Whatever, man. No, look, this shit is getting out of hand, bro. I don't know half of these heads in here. Just tear it apart. Fuck all that, man! Listen to me, bro. You need to control this shit. Are you alright? Tear... this shit apart! Layla? What the fuck are you doing? Caleb, what the fuck?! - What is wrong with you? - Relax! You don't even know her. - No, stop, come on. - You're fucking dead, Aiden. - You're fucking dead! - We'll get him.

I said not fucking now! Listen, Liz is messed up right now, bro. What's going on? I-I have to do this, alright? I-I have to. Well, I don't know what you're talking about, but, um... listen, you're in no shape or form to be going and talking to LL right now. Sure I am, Blake. You fucking said so yourself. I'm a monster, right? I am. I want you to get the fuck out of my face. I said get the fuck out! I'm gone, asshole. Let me help you. I'm losing my fucking mind. Stress is very dangerous. - I can't. - Yes, you can. Yes. I know you can. There's no plan anymore. I gave all of Wall's money to you. I don't even know if anything I recorded of him will help. I gotta give everything to LL, and... and I can't run. I don't know where to go. I know. So, maybe that's the only alternative, then. - Maybe. - Maybe... May. Be. I just don't want to live in pain anymore. Death is easy. Safe. No prison. No shame. No pain. No needing anymore. We can be together again, the way we used to be. Aiden, are you there? - Aiden. - Mom? Aiden, I'm so sorry it's so late, but I am stuck at this lounge. It's been a whole thing. - Anyway, we're delayed... - Hey, Mom? Yeah, honey? Remember that beach house? What does that have to do with anything? I would always fantasize about us escaping there. Come on, Aiden, no... That was ages ago. Your dad is long gone. Just... we don't really need to get into any of this. I'd really like to go there now, Mom. Aiden, I know that you've been through a lot. I knew, Mom. About you and Dad. I-I get it. I just... I just wanted you to know, I'm very sorry about how everything went. For so long, I tried pretending like I didn't care. He is the one who cheated. Aiden, I don't blame you. I don't blame you for any of this, okay? I'm... I'm so sorry, Mom. - For everything. - I don't like it. I don't like the sound of this. You're scaring me. I love you, Mom. I love you so, so much. I'm going to come home right now. Okay? Aiden? Aiden! Alright. Tip-fucking-top. Subject is on the premises. There are four targets in total. I repeat: Four targets in total. CI is getting into position. Hold for my signal. Boys. Where's the boss? Little man. It's about time. Is that really necessary? Yeah, he's straight. We dead serious about that cash, my man. You came to my fucking party. Fifty and large. It's in the bag. I thought Blake was just talking up his boy. I see what you guys got goin' on, and I want in. I can move volume, expand across fuckin' territories without it coming back on you. And if that's something you want, then, you know, I want to work. What do you know about work, Aiden? Excuse me? You work for any of this shit you got here? You work so your daddy don't fuck up your face if you look at him wrong, say the wrong thing? Nah. I bet not. I bet birthdays around this hood... Nah, fuck that. I bet a glowin' fuckin' report card gets you a brand-new car. Or a deep-sea fishing trip down to the Caribbean. Right? It sounds so nice. Did you work for what's in that bag? Or is that just the golden boy's weekly allowance? This ain't about me. It's about the money in the bag. And I don't think you give a fuck about where it came from. Now, are we talking, or are we selling? You got a spark, man. Even if you are all kinds of fucked up, 'cause, you know... which one of us isn't, right? Right. So, we cool? Yeah, we're good? Leave the cash. Blake will get you sorted out day after tomorrow. I thought I was gonna get some now. Do you really think that I would just bring 50 large worth of powder to some rich boy's mansion I don't even know? But Blake vouched for me. Are we gonna have a problem here, Aiden? Jesus, kid. Stand by, Ames. We may have to move in. Alright, roger that. We're locked and loaded. Right at the beginning of our fuckin' relationship? No. No, no problem. You're asking me to trust you. That... is you trusting me. So, I'm going to take the cash tonight. Come on, Aiden. Think, son. You give me that shit, that puritan large, I'll turn it around in 48 hours. No, fuck that. I'll turn it around even quicker. 24 hours, pure profit, nothin' else. But if not... ...then I think I'm gonna have to take that bag with me. You feel me? You ain't got a spark. You got a motherfuckin' bonfire. Let's fuckin' rule the world, little man. I am all about this kid. Give him his shit. That's pure. Ten large. You cut it up, you put it on the street... Then bring me back 50 sometime next week. Oh, and, uh... I work alone. So... Blake... leave that kid out of it, huh? Enjoy your high school party. This is your last night in the minor leagues. We got that motherfucker. Let's get my boy out. Alright, SWAT, move for the perimeter. All eyes on the house. There's that motherfucker! You're one big asshole. My mom hits harder than that. Shut the fuck up! Get him the fuck up. Put him up on the wall. Hey... try running track with a broken rib. You know what, yo? Fuck the gym candy. This... well, this is all I need. - Get off...! - Back off! Fuck you! You got to hit harder than that. Let that bitch watch. He's next! Blake, get the fuck out of here. What the fuck is that? - Yo, Caleb, he's bugged! - Aiden, you're a narc?! - Initiate. Go, go, go! - Alright, that's it! Move it, move it, move it! Oh, this is perfect. Blake, I'm sorry. I... What are you babies fighting about? Motherfuckin' sandbox? Yo! Yo! Yo! Hold on, man. Oh, it's this way? Hold on. Hold on! Dude's wearing a motherfuckin' wire! Come on! Police! Police! On the ground now! Move, move, move! Shit. Shit. Stay down. - Shit. - Stay down! Don't... move! How long, man? How long this shit been going on? Fuck! I told you to get the fuck out. I'm not gonna leave my brother. You know I got to kill you for this shit, right? - Stay down! Stay down! - Don't... move! You can kill me later. Just for now, don't die on me. - Go get some help, man! - I'm gonna get some help. Just... Aiden! Uh! Hey. Liz. Aiden... what is this? Okay, now, listen to me. We have to go on three. I can't... I ca... They'll kill us. Come on. Uh! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! This way! Now! Mother fuck...! Where the fuck you at? No... No! It was my fucking collar, man! No, Aiden! You can't stop, Aiden. I just need to sit down. Please... Please, baby. Listen to me, okay? Okay? It's okay. I'm gonna go get help, okay? Go. I'll be back, okay? Okay. Go get help.

One man is in custody and six are dead, after an anonymous tip brought police officers to the scene, in what is believed to be a drug deal gone bad. Three police officers were seriously injured but are in stable condition at St. Joseph's Hospital. More details are still coming in with multiple injuries, as the shootout happened at a local high school student's party. I need help. I need help. Town's a little different than I described it back in the day. You know, nothing stays like you remember it. It's nice. I like it. Layla and her mom disappeared. Something must have lit a fire underneath that woman. Hey, Mom... I'm not going anywhere. Hey, Mom... I love you. You're so nice. I love you too. It's okay. It's okay. I heard you were doing well. You look good. Yeah, well, you look like shit. Yeah, well... I haven't been sleeping great lately. So, I, uh... I heard you got a medal. A medal is just so no one questions whether or not it was a worthy cause. It was, right? You were really something that night, Aiden. Brave... Got that girl out. You kept your head together, when most grown men that I know wouldn't have. I wanted you to know that. My lawyer says the state's not pressing for a prison sentence. A two-year probation and 500 hours' community service is what's on the table. You got anything to do with that? I told you I'd go to bat for you. Look, I'm staying at this little motel in town. The Sea Captain. Smells like one. But it's got a great view of the harbor. I like watching those boats coming in and out. I think I'll extend for a few days. Can't remember the last time I had a vacation. You know... I don't know if I've ever had one. Sounds nice. Maybe tomorrow, come by, take you out for a bite? I, uh... I think I'd like that.
