- How much? - 500. - For the night? - I don't do that. - I've got what it takes. -You talkin' money here? I don't do that. I can't. What's it to you? I wanted to treat myself. Well? Nah. Won't be enough time. Your call. No hurry. - Alright. - "Alright," what? I got to her first. Get lost, or wait your turn. Would you stop! Summer's no time to fight. It's too nice. And hot. Wait. It's your fault too. I can't waste time like that. Understand? Since you're in a hurry, we can all go. I don't mind, really. Neither do I. Unless he's a closet fairy. She's doing them in two's now. She already does 10 for every one of mine. It's never happened to me before. I just love mornings... The detours they make just to see us on their way to work. - With rose in hand. - That's ok. Gives them something to dream about. To hell with it, I'm going. - Know what we look like? - What? Those tiny fish that follow big ones, for their scraps. - That's a bit much. - I hear that's what they do. - I never travel. - What's that got to do with it? - You mean pilot fish! - Oh? Pilots are supposed to be in front! Trust me, they're pilot fish. - Pilot... - Yeah. I have a strange feeling about today. - Say, you seen Rosa? - She's busy, hon'. Take a look at my hands. Still nice and smooth, dainty... Skilled. Let's go. She stole him from under my nose. Julien, check those legs! Whores dress like librarians these days. They're called remoras. How much? I don't go out much. - I was so proud... - It's not that bad. You done with the comparisons? I have to go. You guys were pretty wild. I hope I didn't start anything. The bastard wouldn't stop feeling me up. Didn't seem to bother you! Can we come back? Sure. Just call the office and ask for Rosa. No more than two though. So don't get any ideas! Watch out for AIDS! - Rosa's not here? - We should post signs. - "Rosa's in the stairwell." - "Rosa'll be right back." What's today's? Take a deep breath. You'll smell her prefume. Kiss me...on the cheek. If the cops come by... She's got nothing to worry about. She didn't even touch him. He's dying for it, but... They haven't booked her in two years. Either Gilbert is strong, or she's sneaky. Worse! - She's wholesome. - I wouldn't bank on that. - I bet Gilbert's on the take. - So they say. Know something? We're getting dumber by the day. I checked the Webster's. Remoras are suckers. - What's a Webster's? - A dictionary. He called us suckers! Rosa! - You stole my legionnaire. - He's a useless babbler. Know what a remora is? - A kind of hat? - Remora, not fedora! A fish that sucks on sharks to move around. There you go! Who needs Webster's? I'm glad we cleared that one up. So soon? I didn't even get to talk to her. Think it'll be long? Do you? Yes, it'l be long. Don't stick around. You're not helping us any. Let up on Rosa. She's stubborn as hell. I'm not so sure. - Maybe... - No! I'm sorry. We were closed. A party. I'll be here all day. If you want. You won't be a bother. So long, sir. Your clock is slow, Jeannot. Yes. But I'll catch up, and before you know it, I'll gain a day. See you Thursday, sweetie. See you Thursday, Max. These are in the way. Wait until she sees them! She'll see them back there. Gilbert won't be happy. - Think I'm scared of Gilbert? - No. I'm Corsican. Corsicans aren't punching bags. You're just stubborn mules! Maybe. God knows I work with a bunch of 'em. It's show time! Gilbert'll be happy. You should learn the ropes, Yvette. Rome wasn't built in a day! Look at that. About this winter... There's a fur sale going on. My mink's looking tattered. Have Pierrot make one. I have an account there. I'd like you to come pick it with me! - Last time, we... - Getting carried away? I wouldn't even know how! You know why I'm asking. If you were there, I'd feel like a lady. - Want me to marry you too? - It'd make it proper. Hit it, Rene! "We're 20 years old and we want to have fun "So let's have a party! "We're 20 years old and there's no time like now "To have fun and party! "From dusk till dawn, we'll party "Without a care in the world "Let's live like there's no tomorrow "and have all our fun tonight!" Think I didn't see you? I'll let you in, the run up and hide. Thanks, Jeannot. Stop! This isn't the time. I just can't help it. I'm sentimental. When I turned 20, I got the best gift ever. I found love. I don't know what I did with it since. - Hello, Mr. Leon. - How're things? Here you go. - Great. - Count it. The Count's gone! Go thank everyone. - Keep going. - Don't you worry. You too. "God, what a man will do when he's in love with you "God, what a man will do when he fancies you "God, how I love it when you say our love's forever "God, life would be so simple if I could believe in fantasy." We won't bother anyone. "They stroll the boulevards, asking young ladies to dine. "The secret hope of love makes their eyes shine bright. "Then it's champagne, the perfect strategy, "to end up in her love nest, all warm and cozy. "God, what a man will do when he's in love with you. "God, what a man will do when he fancies you "God, how I love it when you say our love's forever "God, life would be so simple if I could believe your fantasy." "If she happens to be cute, smart and sassy "You'll be on your knees, begging to please. "You'll sing anything for her, including opera... "God, life would be so simple if I could believe "in love." Help me, sweetie. I had a birthday lunch. Just a wing. Then pretend. Get ready. Oh, god. Ready! Jules! Rosa! Happy birthday, honey! Sorry I'm late. - Jules, it'll get cold... - You smell so good! It's not me. It's the duck. Duck a l'orange. You're an angel! They almost cut the heat off this morning. I convinced them to give us a notice. How'd you do that? I told them a pack of lies! I said you walked out on me, that the bank closed early. and I was mugged in the subway. You're lying! I know it! You pulled the little slut routine. Right? I want the details. - Horny bitch! - Jules! Please! I'm as innocent as the day you met me. I mean...I've never been with anyone else. Sweetie. Jules... What's wrong, sweetie? Tell me... Lowlife song of a bitch! Throw those out. No. Give 'em to me. Look. Guilt flowers! I cheated on you, Rosa. That's why I was late. I cheated on your with a whore. So you were with a whore... While I was stuffing the duck! Getting ready for you! Get undressed. - Not that... - Get undressed! - Well? - You mean right now? Shirt. Pants. Underwear. You reek of cheap perfume and unkempt women... How dare you rub up against me! Go...to the sink! Wash everything. Every single thing! Wash everything. Every single thing! Especially your willy! I'll punish you where you sinned. Excuse me! I warned you about this. Well, it happened! Show me. That nutcase again. You're no way near disfigured, trust me. Biting I can handle. This guy uses a razor. You said you knew him. The guy in army surplus clothes, right? Didn't notice the clothes. He kept talking about some girl in Algeria. Can you do anything about it? If it's who I think it is, he's from out of town. So if we nail the nut job, we won't ruffle any feathers. But he'll be back for more. Unless Gilbert... Gets his background check. I'll bring him to his senses. He better not have political ties. I can't afford any rifts right now. He says he's an archivist. He's boring as hell, but he's an ok guy, only can't drink. But you should. Come. - Know his name? - They call him Dede. Sometimes they call him La Balafre It's him, alright. Pierrot! Look who just walked in! Temptation personified. It's not fur season yet. I'll be buying one in two years. - You can have one now. - Thanks to Paulo! Hi, Mataf. Hi, Paulo. Doc. Looking for me? - Come have a seat. - I'm double parked. Rosa turned 20, as you know. I want to buy her a new fur. Seems hers is looking tattered. Do you have anything in my price range? I have three you might like. I'll bring them to you tonight. Where can I find you? Here. Or the hotel. Or at Simone's, down the street. I'll find you. Is 60 ok with you? I don't know. Show me the merchandise first. Think he's a fairy? What makes you say that? He looks around. He'd have to lower his eyes. As a matter of fact, he does. - You hot and bothered? - Me? - Ask Yvette... - Him with a guy? He won't even do it by the back. I tried, but there's no use. Some men ask for it, you know. And I won't do anyhting unless I try it with Paulo first. It's all the same. - Right, Mataf? - What're you smiling for? Nothing. Don't get mad, Paulo. Seems you're hung like an elephant. It's natural for Pierrot to look you over. He's intrigued. Hell, I'm intrigued. That's how it starts. Stop, Mataf! Paulo's about to go ballistic on us. You really had me going for a while! Ok. Onto serious matters. The meeting's tomorrow night. See you, Jeannot. - Well? - Where do I begin? - Was that him? - Yes He drove me back. Come on, spill the beans. I went to his house. I'm the woman of his dreams! - You believed him? - No, but I was flustered. We hopped in the sack and it started to rain. When it was over, he turned to me and said: "You won't believe this, but I saw a rainbow." And I was worried he'd stiff you. I'm afraid he did worse. God, the things he told me! You're still beautiful. How much did he give you? You nuts? I couldn't make him pay. You're so petty sometimes You don't think...? That's ok. I have no regrets. Aren't you afraid of being robbed? I'm surrounded by bodyguards. You're carefree, and you're witty. I'm young. You exude happiness. Think it's contagious? I don't know. But if it is a sickness, it passes quickly. Two bills...want something special? Actually, yes. I'd like you to obey me. I won't touch you. I'll give you orders and you'll touch yourself. You follow? - Does it bother you? - No, why? Nothing bothers you. You'll do everything I tell you, without hesitation. Look! The sun's back. Rosa! You're scaring the clients, Alex. - Did you wash? - No. Come. - I paid the guard to get lost. - Not in the kitchen! Come this way then. Come on! Pull your dress up. Pull your panties down. Hurry. - You didn't wash, right? - No. He didn't touch me. He's scared he'll catch something. I told him the mouth's just as risky. Shit. Sorry. Take you money back. No. Keep it. But promise me... You know when I'll be back, right? Yes. Save it for me, ok? I love feeling hot sperm inside of you. I know. Wipe your forehead, you're drenched. Don't tell anyone you paid off the guard. Gilbert won't like that. That was some party. I can still see you in that tight skirt with tons of makeup! Her 20th birthday party's ancient history! I'm 38, I think. I've decided to stay stuck at 35. I thought we had to walk around wearing numbers! - What was your name again? - Lise Marie. Then Gilbert told her: "You'll be Rosa La Rose." After two of his favorite movies. Gilbert was always crazy about the movies. He's not crazy about anything now. So we rent old movies and watch them at his country place. My father loved Vivianne Romance. - Figures. - What do you mean? She always played the hooker. You're not superstitious. Hats bring you luck, not bags. Got something for me? Since when do we pay up front? It's too much. Take me standing. I'm sick of undressing. That's enough. Wait. You're soft. - Leave. - "Julien." "Leave, Julien." What if I wanted to leave? - Need a rest? - No. Really leave. For good. For good... You mean quite the streets? Yes. You know you're free. How much would you want? How much? More than you can afford. But don't worry, I won't hold you prisoner. I'd stand to lose. You're profitable. But that's not what I like about you. - Know what I like? - What? What I like is that you've got heart. I've got heart too. The day you want to take back the freedom you never lost, just say the word and... We going to the country Sunday? You want to? Yep. Will you pick a good movie? - You're not leaving? - It was just a thought. I was curious. It's just as well. If you'd left, it would've been for a man, and I would've been very worried. About you. Fix my tie, will you? You have to work to survive. A lot. Wherever you go, we'll make sure you never have work. There's always a desert island. Fresh water, birds... Any chance that's enough for you? One in a thousand. Still coming to the country? No. Are you mad at me? Yes you are, and that's not nice. Did I ask who you were leaving with? Was I not discreet? You set your terms ever so innocently, and you think that's fair? I can't, Rosa. I can't accept anyone leaving me. I'm 50, you're 20. In five years I'll retire. I'll have enough money to live comfortably. I never expected you to retire with me. You have your life to live. However I will look forward to your visits. Now and then, and less and less. Until then, dignity prevents me from letting you go. Five years. Five more years, and I promise you'll be free. You can wait five years. No. Sit down. You too, Jeannot. I need money. My plan to retire in five years is too far off. I've pushed the deadline forward. I have to increase my share in the business. If you disagree, I'll understand. I'll do it without you. You expect us to believe you'll replace us in 24 hours? Yes. I'm the one who sings your praise. I tell them you're irreplaceable. Experts. And they beleive me, because I'm convincing. Gilbert. The first person to screw me... ...isn't born yet. I've heard it all before. I don't understand your attitude. What do you want, Paulo? A fistfight? I wouldn't last 10 seconds. I hate fights. And you, Mataf? Think you'll blow on me and I'll crumble? We never talked like this, Gilbert. Before Gilbert, you were satisfied making peanuts. A minimum of respect, please. Do you respect Gilbert? Yes. - Yes. - Then trust him. He's always given what you asked for. Now he's doing the asking. It's ok, Jeannot. I have another plan. Shoot. - Mataf? - Let's hear it. I want to keep things in the family. Rather tha use force to instigate fear, we'll send our ladies to the front. No forcing, no punches, just charm. Charm and happiness. The conciliatory approach. There's nothing like it. What's our role in this? Quiet surveillance, from a distance. Tell us what's bothering you, Gilbert. Rosa? Have you seen Gilbert? He's probably at the meeting. Why? It's confidential. Jeannot said the meeting's over. Already? Try Simone's. I just did. Is he at the hotel? No. I don't know where he is. All I can say is, Gilbert's thinking of you. - Understand? - I know. Problems, Rosa? My problem is Gilbert. It's like I'm pushing them away today. You're chasing them away because you're ignoring them. You're thinking of something, or someone. Does it show? - Were you spying on me? - I was looking for you. But when I saw that distant look in your eye... I didn't dare. Didn't dare what? I see where you're headed, little guy. - No means no, ok? - Look. Where'd you steal that? Bring it back! My father gave it to me! He wouldn't fork it over, so I told him what it was for. Man, he was happy! He said it's the best way to spend money. - Did he really? - You bet! He's damn right too! Right or not the answer's still "no." Rosa... Think I'd sleep with a young pup? Try girls your own age. No way. What'll my father say? I never even jerked off. I want the first time to be awesome. Only you can make it that way. Don't just stand there, males are on the horizon! Tons of 'em. I'm going to the party. You'll get me in trouble. Go! Sorry, it's an emergency. I have to talk to you. They let her out of jail! - What's her name, anyway? - France without pants! - How'd that come about? - Her name's France. You figure out the rest. She started with big guns and worked her way down! What's so wrong with that? No one said it's wrong. She's less in demand, so she sells drugs now. - Meeting's over already? - We'll talk about it later. Gilbert's losing it and we think it's serious. Rosa's behind it. - You know something? - Don't you know I read Tarot? If Gilbert's bokners, it's because of Rosa. Me and Paulo want no part of his nonsense. Rosa can do what she wants. We don't care. As long as we get our piece of the pie. From what we gather, Rosa wants out and it's making Gilbert sick. He'll do just about anything. Rosa has to be brought to her senses. We need your help. Know what you're asking us to do? Squeal on a friend. Come on! Don't mix things up here! It's not about squealing. It's about shedding light on the matter. You want us to shed light? Forget it! We're not light bulbs. Rosa's sacred to us. Sometimes! This stuff happens. It's between her and Gilbert. Set up a board meeting. We'll act as witnesses or arbitrators, but that's it. - Sometimes! - Forget it, Paulo. These drunken old tarts won't help us any! Hey! Yes, we drank! We drank! You know why? Shut up! Because some guy wanted a threesome and we said no! Know what "no" means at my age? I have morals! Morals! - Quite busting our chops! - You looking for Rosa? - She went to Simone's - Are you sure? Yeah. Let's get your buddy Dede to scare the shit out of her. Congratulations. - You squeal like a pro! - He tripped them up. You bet. She's with that painter of hers. They better not nail her. Go find them. and tell Rosa to hide until we find Gilbert. If I don't find them, I'll be on the rides. I can't take you home. I live with someone. I didn't ask you to. Something happened between us, Rosa. I should speak for myself, but... Listen to me. I'll fight anything or anyone to have you. I never felt alive, until today. Work is like a drug. It wears you out, but it doesn't make you miserable. So you say to yourself: "It's all the same, no matter who I'm with." Today, I'm sure of something. for the first time in my life. It can't go on like this. I'm not talking about love. I know it wouldn't faze you. I'm talking about living a different way. That's why I'll never leave you. I can never live the way I did before you. There's nothing we can do about it, Rosa. Can you understand that? Look at me. Rosa. Tell me one thing. Can you understand that I can't live like before, and that's why I'll never leave you? Tell me. Can you understand that? It wouldn't seem right to live any other way. I can't be the way I was before you. See? I'm not talking about love. Rosa...look at me. I'm going to the bathroom. - Wanna pour me one, buddy? - Not now. Just one. Then we're closing. Just one. But a real one! Know what I'm getting at? You know what I mean. You won't be with those lowlifes, dancing single file! You'll stay behind that counter of yours collecting tips. It's better than nothing. Wanna know what I think? I need to piss. Piss? Why the hell not? Pissing's natural. Not like the government! The government's not natural! The government isn't society. The government breeds class distinction. And the absence of freedom. pushes people to racism. Hard time digesting? Right. - Did you serve us? - Beer and coffee, right? Do me a favor. Go see the man I was sitting with, and ...ask him if... Just to get his attention. - He can't see me leave. - Don't worry about it. Just wait upstairs for a bit. I'll be right back. When I yell out "two beers," go. There's plenty more fish in the sea. - Down with power! - You're not on stage here. The only stage is the street! Then get out there! Go to Algeria or Indochina. - There's much to be done. - You're right! But you don't know why. You don't know why! They're weak countries. They need freedom, not tyranny! - Two beers. -Authority destroys. with it's violence... Yes, sweetie? Obedience and order aren't necessary for mutual respect! - Let go of me, Dede. - Enough, Dede! Harp on politics, not my customers. She's not your customer, I'll have you know. - She's mine! - Stop! No! Not him! Let's go. I don't care if he stays or goes, I'm not leaving you. I won't go with you, Julien. You tried taking off on me. It was easier for me. I've always been straight with you. You can't take off on me like that! That's downright mean. I don't deserve that, Rosa. I won't go with you, Julien. Don't you want me? Answer me! - Want to live with me? - I can't. That's not what I asked you. Don't ask me anything. Let me go. Go. I don't care. I love you. What'll it take for you to talk to me? Grab you like that lunatic? Is that it? - I love you. Don't you get it? - I love you too. We'll go to my place and figure something out. We can't hurt anyone. We both have things to settle. You settle yours, and I'l settle mine. Reminds me of a movie I watched with Gilbert. He always cried when he watched it. It's about two people who put their love to the test. So they decide to part ways and meet in six months. Six months? They were rich. They had bigger problems than we do. Give me six days. Meet me at the cafe in six days. - Do you trust me? - Do I have a choice? No, Julien. Not like that. Nicely. Total trust. In six days, at that cafe, at that table... If you're not there, it'll be my loss. If I'm not there, it'll mean nothing's possible. Love blossoms when things are calm. It wouldn't last if we always had to flee. What're you saying? - That's nonsense. - No. That's life. Don't you know? You don't know. In six days, at the very same table. If I'm not there, don't ever try and find me. Not even by chance! Now go. Hurry! Julien! Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Finally! You're in luck. I looked everywhere for you! They sent Dede to scare the hell out of you! I know. I couldn't care less. Come. We're gonna bump into Mataf and Paulo! - I lied to them. - You scared? Yes. But I'll stop being scared, if you want. You still want to make love to me? And how! In the closet. - Jeannot. - Excuse me. 50,000 pamphlets. Is that enough? Plenty. What's that? - Brass knuckles. - Take them with you. - Gilbert! - Yes? - It's Pierrot. - What does he want? - He has an appointment. - Come here. Hide the goods until tomorrow night. If anyone asks for me, I'm away for 48 hours. - He's on his way. - Great. Fancy! I carry nothing but the best. Very fancy. How much? 60. I can't, Pierrot. Here's 30,000. I can't go higher. - I'm losing money here. - I know. I'll pay you the rest in cash or services rendered. - As a matter... - Already. - Gilbert, it's Paulo and Mataf. - Ask them what they want. So? I'm quitting fur. I bought a sauna and hired a guy to run it. Is he good? I'll say. I have to grease everyone's palms though. - They saw Rosa. - And? She went to the hotel with the kid. Tell them not to do anything. I'll take care of it. Tell me the rest of your fairytale. He's someone I can trust. I get along with him on so many levels. Know what I mean? Only he's flat broke. I keep lending him money and eating away at my capital. In the long run... See? This is what women are about. Touch. Silk makes us even more naked. I only wear this with Gilbert. Never with clients. Don't crease it! Touch it gently. Lie down again. Everything's good about pleasure. Men taught me that. Everything's good. You won't forget? Undress me now. Slowly. The more you hurry, the more pleasure you lose. Come to me now. I'll never be able to forget you. I just knew it. I was right. - Why'd you let me sleep? - To look at you. To remember you better. The sun's coming up... Here. Put that back. I insist. Some other time. Not today. You're taking away part of my pleasure. Is that so? You have to get dressed now. - Expecting someone? - You could say that. What'd you do with the money? I added it to your pile. Take it back. Why? Because you're going to help me. Really? You'll do me a big favor. Anything you want. - Swear by it? - Ok. After there's no turning back. I swear. Unfold the cloth. Take it. Keep the cloth around it. - What're we playing? - We're not playing. Once you're done, I want you to wipe everything. The furniture, the bed, the door handle. Rosa? - You're scared? - No. I don't understand. Here. See this knife? I want you to stab me in the stomach, in one fell swoop. Got that? One fell swoop. I could never... Yes! It's nothing. Don't be scared. It's not to die. It's to have a chance. A fifty-fifty chance. Explain, Rosa. Please, explain. You swore. Leave, lock the door, go downstairs, exit without being seen, pretend I threw you the key, go to reception, give them the key, they'll come up, see me, rush me to the hospital, don't worry... We waited for you, Gilbert. - See? We didn't go up. - It's the best. We've always been clear on that. - Rosa answers to me. - It's risky, with a minor. Hurry! - She's hurt. - Was it Dede? Mataf, get the doctor! - Why'd she do that to me? - What, sweetie? Gilbert... She's coming to. - How is she? - Not good. You said one in a thousand. It's fifty-fifty. Don't say anything. - I'll do the talking. - Ok... You like it? It's my present to you. My birthday's passed. It's not for your birthday. It's to celebrate your freedom. I'm so hot... I'm suffocating. You shouldn't have believed me. You shouldn't have listened. We talk to give ourselves importance. To impose it. I always believed what you told me, Gilbert. It always served me well. What time is it? Nine. That's why... I feel the heat already. - Open the window, doc. - It's not a good idea, Rosa. Go on, sleep. For me. I'm too scared. Of what? You've aged... Kiss me. Let him be. I need air. The window... Please, doc.
