- As I've said, pledge, we can stay here all night, or we can just call it quits now, and you can crawl back to whatever trailer park you came from. - No, no, I, I don't wanna quit. - Then you know what you need to do. You're the last one we're waiting for. The other pledges finished this task awhile ago. Do it! Very good, pledge. You honestly had me questioning your commitment to the Delta Sigma Sigma's, but you've proven yourself to not be the whiny little slut I took you for. Now, we have one final task for you to complete that sister Hannah will explain. - What, one more task? You said that was the last one. - Oh, no, no, I said this was the last day. You very much have just one more task to complete. Sister Hannah, show her. - We as sisters share the most intimate details with each other, and we have to make sure you're comfortable in doing so. You have 45 seconds to get started, or you will fail your initiation. - This is a joke, right? - 40 seconds. - This, this isn't right. This is just sick. - So, what are you quitting? I knew it, you wasted our fucking time. - 30 seconds. - Please, I'll do anything else. - 10 seconds. - That's a good little whore. Now, keep going until we tell you to stop. Well, I guess I'll open up my gift next. Oh, it's from Angela, charming card. Hmm, it's lovely, thank you, Angela. But, one question. Why did you give me a Happy Holidays card? You're not one of those people who are like, offended by Christmas or something, are you? - Of course not. I just thought the card was nice. - Nice, well, we here at Delta Sigma Sigma celebrate Christmas, not Hanukkah, Quingua, or any of those other stupid made up holidays. So, when your card says Happy Holidays, just which holidays are you referring to exactly? - You're looking too far into it when you should be appreciating the thought behind it. That is what the Christmas season is about, correct? - Why don't you open my gift to you? - Why don't you use for us like you did a few months ago. - That was fucked up. - Oh please, liberal lezzie needed to be taken down a notch. She's been acting like she's so much better than everyone since she's been here. I'm just reminding her who's in charge. Now, who else has a present for me? Anyone, that's okay. - What're you doing, you stupid bitch? - Mm hmm. - Babe, all I was saying was I just, I, I don't get it. Come one, why would you pledge the same sorority where your sister was murdered? I mean, I, I don't get that. I'm not trying to be an ass, Danielle. I just don't get it. - Well, I guess at the time it just felt like it was a good way to honor her. You know, being part of the house she loved so much. It's, it's sentimental B.S., I know. - But, I, I don't like seeing what being in this house, especially around Christmas, is doing to you. - Well, it's my first Christmas here. You know, it's just something I gotta get through, but it'll get better, I promise. - Okay, kiddo, you gonna be ready for the party Friday night? - You mean the sorority girls dressed in slutty Mrs. Claus outfits, and drunk frat boys in Santa hats trying to lore them under the mistletoe? Ah, yeah, I wouldn't miss it. - Perfect, ah, I'm gonna head out. I'll call you later. Can, can you just try to get some rest? - Yeah, okay, adios. Hey, Kayla, more cookies for the party? - You know me, a regular Rachael Ray , but I uh, I think Rachael Ray may have made some prettier cookies. - Mm, you know, it's real uh, 1950s Rockwell Christmas of you to think college kids are gonna be all about the cookies at the party. - Come on, it's a Christmas party. There should be some decorum. - Oh, okay. - Whatever, so how's my brother doing? - Hmm, he's good, he's charming as ever. - Has he um, has he said if Grant's gonna be at the party? - Oh my God, Kayla, you just have to talk to him. - I know, I know, I, I guess I'm old fashioned. I like when the guy courts the girl. - You really were born in the wrong decade. - I know, right? So, how are you doing? I mean really. I know this time of year in this house has gotta be hard for you. - You sound like your brother. - It just means we both care about you. - And I appreciate that, but I'm fine, I promise. - Okay, but if you ever need to talk or anything, my ears are yours. So, wanna help me finish decorating these cookies? - You know, as tempting as that offer sounds, I think I'm just gonna go lay down. I've had some trouble sleeping recently. - Okay, but at least take that one you've been picking at. - Hey, thank you for being so welcoming and understanding. It means a lot. - Yeah, sure. - Oh, it's just me. - Sorry, I just. - Oh, no need to explain, girl. Fixated on my door for obvious reasons. I told you if you wanted to switch rooms, although that's kind of morbid, but I'd be more than willing. - God, no, no, I already can barely sleep in this house, so no. - I wish you would've talked to me before you decided to pledge. - I just need to go lie down, and then this party, so I can go home and get away from here for a bit, so. - Okay, but hey, we need to talk, I'm serious. This isn't good for you. - I'm fine. - Bullshit, go get some rest. We'll talk later. - Okay. - All I know is someone needs to take a fucking creative writing class. What a lame ass poem. - Be serious. - I am serious, Dani. I mean, obviously this is just some asshole trying to get a rise out of you. I mean, Mrs. Claus, come on. - Okay, but why now? - Um, duh, it's Christmastime. Your sister was murdered 10 years ago, and you, you walk around here like you're fucking girl interrupted. Not even attempting to hide the fact that being here creeps you the hell out. Obviously, someone picked up on this, and decided to give you shit. - I don't know, it just, it seems so vicious. - Sorority bitches are vicious, Dani. I mean, look at the stories about your sister. - What do you mean by that? - So, you're gonna pretend you haven't heard the stories? - You mean the hazing stories? It's not like she was the only one doing those things. I mean, every sorority and fraternity on campus was doing it. - Well, not just that, but yes, that's a good place to start. Well, what about what she supposedly did to that girl the night that she was killed? - I, I can't believe you're bringing this up right now. That girl was a fucking psychopath, and my sister, she, she played an innocent joke on her, but that does not mean that she deserves to-- - You know that's not what I mean, but you can't ignore her reputation. Whether you think it's justified or not, not many people have much nice to say about her, and as a result, would jump at the chance to terrorize you. - Christ, I can't deal with this right now. I mean, ever since coming here, I've tried to not let this whole fucked up scenario of living in the same house where my sister was murdered bother me, but. - That was your choice, Dani. - I know that, okay, but does not mean I deserve to be harassed by some asshole. - You're right, here. - What're you doing? No, don't waste your. - Sent. - Ah, fuck. - Who was that? - Well, just Jake. - And you're not gonna respond to him? - Does it matter? - Apparently not. So, are you gonna miss me over break, hmm, hmm? - Yeah, sure. - Convincing. - I'll miss fucking you. - Oh, nice, but I'm sure Grant boy has plenty of girls lined up to fuck. - Mm, yeah but, you're one of my favs. - I should go, it's gonna be getting dark soon. - You're really driving home tonight? It's like three hours away. Plus, you're gonna miss your sorority's party. - I'm not much for Christmas parties. - Alcohol and me? What's not to like? - So, is that an invitation to take me to the party, hmm? I didn't think so. Listen, you have a Merry Christmas. - You get like this every time we fuck. - Then stop fucking me, Grant. - You want some help? - Oh, no thanks. You know me, a perfectionist. - I've noticed, you know, I just don't understand why you put in so effort to a tree when no one really stays here for, hey Soph. Late day at work? - Nah, I was with Grant. I'm just gonna bring my bags. I need to get on the road. - Are you sure you can't stay here for the party? - Nope. - Can I help you? - Ah, I'm a, I'm Angela's mother. The girl that was murdered here 10 years ago. - Of course, I recognize you from the news. I thought Angela committed suici-- - She, she was murdered. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to um, Mrs. Werner, what can I do for you. - Look, is, is, is that Danielle King really living here? - Yeah, but I think she's sleeping. - Well, I need to speak to her. Please, you go get her. - I don't know if that's a good idea, I mean she's-- - Please, I, I've tried for years to gain closure for my daughter's death. This is something I need to do. - I thought you were sleeping? - I heard the doorbell. What're you doing here? - Oh, so it's true? Why child, why would you live here when your blood has caused nothing but pain and destruction. This house is forever tainted because of your sister! - What're you talking about? Your daughter murdered my sister. - Please, let's calm down, I don't think-- - Your sister was evil! I knew it! Angela knew it! You know it and your living here is a slap in the face to my daughter and her memory. - That's enough, please, I think you need to leave. - Look at you, you're just like your sister. You can't help it. Selfishness and evil run through veins. Well, I'm gonna move on knowing that fact, but believe that I wish you only pain from living here, and I pray that this Christmas fills you with anguish. - Are you okay? Please, don't, don't listen to her. - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm used to her. I just didn't think she'd come here. - Grief can make people do crazy things. - What was all that yelling about? - Never mind, remember we have a party to prepare for tomorrow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm sorry you had to deal with her. Go upstairs, shake it off. Get some rest, call Kyle. - Hey! - Hey, Danielle, are you, are you good? Kayla texted me, just told me what happened. - Of course she did. Ah yeah, I'm fine. I'm a little shaken up, but I'm fine. - Oh my God, hopefully that crazy bitch is gone, but Danielle, you have to promise me if she comes back you're gonna call the police. - Yeah, we'll see, I mean, she's mostly harmless. She's harassed my family before, but she's more annoying than anything else. - Ah shit, okay, Jake's here. I gotta go, but if anything else happens call me. Um and, if not, I'll see you tomorrow. Can you bring the sexy Santa Claus outfit. I really like that. - Yes, sir. - I love you. - Yeah, ditto. - Hello, Delta Sigma Sigma house, this is Kayla speaking. Oh hi, Mrs. Benson. No, Sophie isn't here. She left last night. She isn't home yet? That's strange, yeah, she definitely left last night. Of course, I'll ask around and get back to you. I'm sure she's fine. Bye, and please, let me know if you hear from her. - Whoa, good morning, jumpy today? - No, I'm sorry, I guess I was daydreaming. - Who called, huh? - Oh, wrong number. - Oh, so about the party tonight, don't be too surprised if not too many people show up. - So I've been told. - Well, I just wanna be real with you. You've worked so hard on all this, and I just don't want you to be hurt, because word is not too many people are coming. Most have already left campus. - You know me, constant optimist. Look, I'm sure the turnout will be fine, whether is five people or a hundred and five people. It's really about celebrating the true meaning of the holiday. - Okay, well, I'll talk to you later, okay. - Yeah, oh wait, um, Kyle's taking Danielle and me to get some last minute party stuff. Can you please put the finishing touches on the decorations? - Yeah, yeah, whatever, bye. - Thanks. Cornell, do you copy? - Yes, what is it, over. - I'm sending a call to your cellphone, a Mrs. Benson, says her daughter left campus last night, but hasn't made it home. Seems pretty upset. Sounds like she needs to talk to another woman. - Okay, oh, and that's an example of the sexism I was talking about, over. - Sure, doll. Let me know if you need anything, over and out. - Good afternoon, officer, care to make a donation? It's for the little ones in the hospital. Much appreciated, you have a blessed Christmas. - You too, sir. - Hello, Kayla, Danielle! Is that you guys? What the hell? - So, as each year passes, and a new batch of freshman infiltrate our quaint campus, the memory of that brutal murder, suicide that took place here fades, and is replaced by numerous, more salacious stories. However, that does not diminish the terrible scar that event left here. Not only on this town, but on this school as well. It should be a reminder that our actions have consequences. When we allow systems to be set up that encourage and relish in requiring young people to beg and humiliate themselves in order to gain acceptance, than we shouldn't be surprised when something like the Delta Sigma Sigma tragedy occurs. Anyway friends, that is an end to this episode. Until next week, this is Tyler signing off. - You know, this is some serious overkill for the five people that are gonna show. - Yeah, kinda looks Christmas vomited in here. - Kayla likes it. - Hey, Madison still hasn't shown up? You really can't count on anyone anymore. Guess being a sister means nothing to her. Come on, help with the snacks. Guests will be here any minute. - I got it, I got it. - Okay, uh, sparkling juice, really? You might as well just gotten them milk. - It's B-Y-O-B. If the frat boys wanna get drunk, they can do it on their own dime. - You know, you really miss the entire point of being in a sorority, don't you? - Ho, ho, ho, hoes. Who's ready to get smashed in the name of Santa? - Hell to the yes, and Jake is in the house. - I'm glad you could all make it to the Delta Sigma Sigma's traditional Christmas celebration. - Sneaky, little bastard. - So uh, who else is supposed to show up to this uh, little fiesta? - I'm not sure, anyone on campus can come. - But, most everyone's gone now for break. - Well hey, that's fine. We can have our own little party. Who actually believes that more is merrier bullshit anyways? - I don't. - So, when did your house start having this party again? I heard that after what happened they stopped doing it for awhile, out of respect or something. - I'm not sure. I just took it over this year. - So, can we talk about what happened here, you know, that murder, suicide thing? - Dude. - Oh shit, my bad, dude. Wasn't one of them like your cousin or something? - Sister, one was my sister. But that doesn't mean we don't have to talk about it. - I don't really think that's a good idea, Dani, we shouldn't-- - Now, was your sister the who was killed, or the one who killed herself? - She was um, the one who was killed. - I heard it was over some prank, is that, is that true? - Jesus, guys, it's called tact. - Seriously. - No, it's okay, really. I can talk about it. I'm not that fragile. - I don't know, are you sure? - Yeah, it was a prank. My sister and some of the other girls, it was just some typical hazing stuff. It got out of hand, but if Amber would've known the girl had issues, then she wouldn't have taken that far. - What I can't understand is why you would pledge to a sorority that allowed your sister to bully a girl leading to their deaths. Better yet, why are sororities and fraternities even allowed to exist on this campus anymore? - It's a good thing you don't have to understand it, man. Okay, Danielle is capable of-- - Sororities and frats have this type of history of abuse and bullying, which caused the deaths that happened here, and as long as sheep keep pledging these outdated institutions, then we as a society are saying it's okay. So, don't be surprised if it happens again, Danielle. - You can not be seriously blaming sororities for murder. - Yet, here he is. - Come on dude! Frats have nothing to do with murder. You wanna know how to avoid getting killed? - How? - You be ugly. - What? - Seriously, you don't see ugly people getting murdered. Serial killers just aren't interested in them, and Jason, Michael, and Freddy, they don't go after the uglies. - Then you're definitely safe, man. - Knock, knock. - Shit, definitely not the guest I had in mind. - Relax, I'm not overly concerned about your alcohol consumption, yet. Have any of you seen Sophie Benson since last evening? - No, I saw her last night before she headed home, why? - Interesting, anyone else? - No, she isn't home? - I assume you already know that since you talked to her mother this morning about her not making it home, correct? You're Kayla, right? - Is that who called this morning? You said it was a wrong number. - Wait, Kayla, why would you-- - Stop. - I need to know who the last person to speak with Sophie was and what she said. Did she say she was for sure going home? - Yes, yes, she for sure left last night with her things. - Was this before or after she was with you? - After. - Then why is her vehicle parked at your place? - What, no, she definitely headed out last night, and her car was nowhere near my place today. - Well, it's there now, plain as day. Listen, if you know where she is, please tell me. Her mother is worried sick. Fine, in light of this little development, I suggest you forget all about this little party. We'll be making sure that nobody else attends. In the meantime, I ask that none of travel too far away from here. I'm sure I'll need to talk to you again. - Are we like under arrest or something? - No, of course not. Should you be? I just need you all to be as concerned about finding your friend as I am. That means I need you to stay close, so I can get more information. And no more booze. I'll appreciate your cooperation. - Isn't she just like a rent-a-cop? Do we really have to listen to her? - Wait, so why didn't you mention talking to Sophie's mom yesterday, when she said she didn't make it home? Why did you lie about who called? - I don't know. I just assumed she shacked up with some other guy. - Kayla, you still should've told us. - Exactly. - What if, what if something bad happened to her. - Wait, are you sure that she said she was going home last night? - Yes, I texted her after we hooked up, and she responded back saying she was heading out. - I'm not gonna get involved in this if you guys did something to her. I barely knew her. - Do you think a few of us should go and see if we can find her, or? - Well, the food and the uh, the booze is here, so uh, this is where my ass is staying for the time being. - Come on, dude, you're really gonna fucking light up with Officer Snoopy Tits snooping around? - Yeah. Fuck her, seriously, she's just a rent-a-cop. What is she gonna do? - No, no, we all should stay here. - Okay, but um, can I talk to you privately? - Yeah, okay, I'm outta here, because I don't wanna be involved in another part of your sorority house drama, which involves the cops again. Fuck you. - Wait, don't go, or at least let me walk with you. - Yeah, sure, come on. - Talk about drama. - I know, right, Tyler's a little pussy. So, rent-a-cop, she's so serious. What the fuck? This is some like, Law and Order, SUV shit, right? - SVU, dumb ass. - What's up, babe, are you worried about Sophie or what? - No, no, I'm sure she's fine. I just wanted away from the craziness down there. - Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine. - Yeah, also, I wanted to give you this. - Um, no way, if I had known, I would've brought your gift. It's at home. - Just, open it. - Okay. - So you can stop being late to all of our dates. - I fucking love you. And I love this. Thank you, babe. - And uh, you can give me my present when I get back. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. - Tomorrow? - Yeah, I'm sorry, I didn't tell you sooner. I just really need to get away and clear my mind. Plus, my mom really needs me this time of year. - Uh, yeah, no, of course. That's, that is fine. You know, we will celebrate as soon as you get back. - Mm hmm. - And in the meantime, I just remembered, I actually do have a gift for you. - Really? - Yeah, it just uh, requires me to take my shirt off. - Yeah? - Maybe my pants. - Real slick. You're doing a good job with that shirt. - It's a very tight shirt. - Yeah. - All right, you know what? Fuck the shirt. - Yeah. - It's kind of cold, huh? - Oh well, take my jacket. Here you go. - Thanks, Tyler. - Yeah, of course. - Hey, thanks for staying and you know, hanging out with me. I don't know how much more of them I could take. - Then why do you live here? - Wow, you really are anti-sorority, aren't you? Well, I'm the first in my family to go to college, and I guess I just wanted to embrace the whole experience, and Greek Life just seemed to be a requirement. - But you seem so different from the rest of them. - Why, because I'm black? - No, no, no, no, that's not at all what I meant. - I'm just fucking with you. Is that a smile on Tyler Hudson's face? Alert the press. - My apologies, just being in a house where two people needlessly died just kind of dampens my spirits, you know. - Yeah, I like your podcasts. - Thank you, I really didn't think anyone around here listened to it. - Well, I do, and I think you have a great voice, among other things. - Thanks. You know I'm gay, right? - Seriously? Don't I feel like an asshole? - No, no, no, I, you don't, you're not an asshole. I'm actually incredibly flattered, and it was really sweet. - Yeah, right. Hey, I should um, probably get back to the party, you know. It is our party, so I should be in there. I'll talk to you later. - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Monica, you can be on my podcast sometime. - Sure Tyler, that'd be neat. - Monica, what can we talk about on my podcast? How about the guys that you're interested in? Or we could talk about the sorority system. Yeah, I can find out more about that family. I'm gonna text you right now. - I suppose I should go back and join this wonderfully shitty party. What the hell, you guys? - Sorry, I'm sorry, I had to do that. We're just going out back for some uh, you know. All of the time. - Whatever, but Tyler might still be out there. - I'll just tell that gay ass to come back inside. - Did everybody know? Hey, if that cop comes back your asses are gonna get busted. - Rent-a-cop. Tyler, you out here, bro? I guess not. We got the whole place to ourselves, babe. - Cool, let's go. - I don't. I was thinking we could go somewhere a little more private. - Well, like where? - In there. - Seriously, you wanna go in there? - You want that cop to come back and come bust us? - So, um, you guys are 6-1 this year, right? That's, that's really good. - Yeah, we would've actually won the last game too, if Brandt didn't fucking fumble. - Uh, yeah, geez, that sounds pretty rough. - It was pretty rough. You follow football? - Oh um, I guess I don't really like football that much, as kind of follow around the school team. - Huh well, hey, that's, that's cool. Thanks for asking. - Oh, yeah, totally. - That was great. I mean, I have missed that these last few weeks. - Yeah, I bet. - Not like that, you know. I, I, I mean how in sync I feel with you tonight. Like, you're into me and nothing else matters. - Well, tonight nothing else does. - I love you, Danielle. Well, we need to get downstairs and see the others before they start to wonder what happened. - Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's go. - Today has been a crazy fucking night. First the cop comes and then Sophie missing. - Yeah, and his face when she said Sophie's car was at his place. - I know, it's like she pulled some Gone Girl shit or something. That crazy bitch is so obsessed with him. - Well, Grant is pretty hot. I mean, I'd fuck him. - What? - What? - Does everybody wanna fuck him? Oh, like, so you know that was a one time thing. - Yeah, sorry, I just really miss you. - Hey, uh, uh, uh, stay. I got you something. - What? - This little thing. - You're such a dork. - Do I even need to ask what you two were doing? - Hell yeah, Kyle, my man. - Okay, how about we liven up this party a little bit since everyone seems to be a bit on edge. - Seriously, look, what the fuck is this? - Shh, shh. - Relax, Grant. - Just feel the vibe. - Not everything can be techno. - This is ridiculous. - Close your eyes. - Yo, this is a party, right? It's a fucking party. - How much gel do you put in your hair, Grant? Like, on a daily basis? - How much lube do you put on your pussy, bro? - A fuck ton! - Come here. - Where did you get this? - Um, I don't know actually. I got it, I got it from a guy. I was underground, yeah, in like a sewer, and he had like this mask, kind of looked like a clown. Something like that. Yeah, I got it from him and he was like, hey, do you want, you want some uh, some weed? And I'm like, yeah bro, hit me up, and then yeah, that's how I got it. Kind of tastes like seaweed. - You got it from a sewer. Are you sure it's pot? - No, I'm not. Tastes like horse butt. You think, you think Santa gets high? - Oh yeah, Santa definitely gets high. I mean, I'd have to get high if I was riding around on a sleigh all night. - Right, like, you know, he's like, Dasher, Dancer, Prancer! Dixon, whatever the rest. - Rudolph. - Rudolph, Rudolph is one them. It's like his nose is lit up. Like who, you have to be high if you thought about that. - Or he's just cold. - Yeah, you're right. - Do you think that Santa gets high with his elves? - He has to. - They have to. - Yeah, he has to get high. You know, like, they work so hard, and they're like, do, do, do, all right, we made enough toys for today, let's go take a break. You know, little weed station. All right, break time. Let's go smoke some weed. - I bet they have the best pot. - Oh, yes they do, they have to. - Yeah. - Let's go. - We gotta go. - Now. - To the North Pole. - Right now? - Yeah. - Is it North or South Pole? - It's North, it's definitely North, yeah. - But who lives in the South Pole? - Anti-Santa. - Anti-Santa, oh, fucking anti-guy. - He gives you coal. - Bleck, I hate coal. - I know, he's a jerk. - He's stupid. - Well, I'm gonna head back in. - Wait, wait. Look, I just wanna say I'm sorry. You know, I, I like what we have right now. Just being really good friends. - Oh Jake, every guy that I date, I compare them to you. I don't think I can be just friends. - Hell yeah, see, that is what I'm talking about. We might as well make the best out of this situation. - You know what, I agree. This is our party. We should be letting loose. Have some fun before we all go home for break, yes. So, Merry Christmas and have a great New Year for the Delta Sigma Sigma's. - And here's to Sophie being okay, yeah. - Okay, I got it, tell me your worst Christmas. - Ooh, this could be good. - Wait, like bad, bad, or funny bad? - Whichever you wanna share, bro. - Okay, now, I got one. Um, do you remember that incident that happened with great-grandpa a couple of years back? - Oh gross, don't even. - Well, now we have to know. - Yeah, spill it, dude. - All right, all right, all right. Um, it had to be about what, five Christmas's ago? Yeah, yeah, because it was the first time the whole family had gotten together in a really long time, and that included my great-grandpa, who was about a hundred years old. Horrible health, but my dad insisted he come. So, so, my mom prepares this crazy Christmas dinner. You know, like ham, pot roast, tons of side dishes. Honestly, it looked and smelled delicious. We unwrapped the gifts, gather around the table, my grandma wheels in my great-grandpa and-- - Wheels in? - Yes, and just as we're being served, there is a long, wet, splattering sound. Whole room fills with this horrible scent. It turned out my great-grandpa had diarrhea. Not just normal diarrhea, really, really bad diarrhea. Yo, I can't even describe the smell. It goes down his pants, all over the floor. Needless to say my appetite was gone. - Dude, that's fucking disgusting. - You are so wrong for sharing that. He was old and sick. He couldn't help it. - I mean, he asked about our worst Christmas. You were there, it was pretty bad. - Poor guy, I feel sorry for him. - Yeah, I mean, he did die like a week later, so. - Luckily, all my Christmas's have been pretty good. - So, anyone else? How about you, Danielle, shit. - My answer that obvious? Oh my God, seriously. You guys, it's okay, all right. All right, you wanna know the truth? I was upset at my sister's death, obviously, but at the time I was more upset that my Christmas was ruined. You know, that year I didn't get my presents. Instead of seeing Santa and the Christmas lights, I went to a visitation and a funeral. Instead of mourning her I was angry at her. You know, I guess that's why I pledged here. It was guilt. Like I felt like I deserved to be haunted by what happened to her. - Shit, Danielle, you had to be like what, eight years old? You were just a little kid. There's no way you had any type of knowing of what was going on. I mean, I'm pretty sure you responded pretty normal. - I mean, kids are selfish, Dani. That's just their nature. - Fuck, I would've been pissed not to receive any Christmas presents if I was eight. - Really, Grant? All right, you know what? You were a kid. Your reaction was totally natural. What matters is that you miss her now. - Yeah, shit, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to turn into some like therapy session or whatever. Please, let the festivities continue, huh, go on. - Ooh, okay, new topic. Who's had sex on Christmas Day? Masturbating? - On that note, I'm gonna go hang out with Tyler. - I thought he left already? - Apparently not, catch you later, guys. - Goodnight. - Yo, speaking of that, Jake and Alexandria headed home? - Yeah, I guess. Look anyway, how about some uh, better music and we have some fun. Play some games, some cards, beer pong, naked Twister. - Fine, I know how to be a good hostess. - Hell, yeah, woo! - Oh, okay, yeah. - Oh my God, oh my God, nope, nope. I'm sorry, but nope. Grant, come on, sit down, sit down. It's over, it is over, yup. My sister and my girlfriend and me, whole show. - Tyler, are you out here? - All right, so, what should we do now? - Ah, maybe something a little low-key. I may or may not be feeling this alcohol. - Okay, um, a movie? - Yeah. - Whatchu got? - I know Madison has a bunch of Christmas movies. We have Elf, A Christmas Story, Christmas Vacation, Prancer? - Hell no, those fucking suck, except for Christmas Vacation. - All right, so what do you suggest? - Have you guys seen Silent Night, Deadly Night? - Mm mm. - About the killer Santa who hacks the shit out of the naughty peeps. - Wow, how very um, festive sounding. - Hey, where's Madison anyway? - I don't know. Did you hear that? - Yeah. - What the heck? Hey guys, come take a look at this. - Is that Madison's phone? - Mm hmm. - Why is it here? That doesn't make any sense. - I know, right, she never leaves without it. - Okay, well, maybe she doesn't know that it's missing. She could've dropped it. - Kyle, you don't understand. Here phone is like her fifth appendage. She never leaves without it. - Yeah, well, she wouldn't have left it in the first place, so. - Just call or text her, guys. It's not that serious. Right, right. - Okay, you know what? Maybe, maybe she's still here. She could be upstairs sleeping. - Uh, I don't know. - I mean, we could at least check. - And on that note, I'm heading out. I'm not sticking around for more missing girl drama. - Yeah, whatever, man. Just get Jake and Alexandria before you go. - Uh, dude, I ain't their dad, later. - Hey, I'm gonna go check for Madison upstairs. - Okay, I'll come. - Shit! - Heading out Mr. Mosley? - Uh yeah, I was heading back to my place. That's all right, isn't it? I'm not under arrest or anything? - Of course not. - Any word from Sophie? - Unfortunately, no, her parents are understandably worried sick, and by my estimation, she's been missing for over 24 hours, so it's out of my hands now, and in the hands of the county police. - I just don't know where she could be. - You can go home, Grant, but I'll take you. Why don't you go have a seat in the patrol car? I'll be out shortly. - Okay, can I sit upfront though, since I'm not under arrest or anything? I just don't people seeing me in the back of a patrol car. - Sure, I was actually going to suggest the same thing. - Coolness, I'll see you fools later. - Merry Christmas, Grant. - Oh, and Mr. Mosley, don't touch anything. - Hey, he's gonna be okay, right? You don't actually think he did anything to Sophie, do you? - Where are the other kids who were here earlier? - Um, Monica and Tyler should be out back. I'm not sure where Jake and Alex are. - You mind if I go out back to have a quick chat with them? - No, no, not at all. - Just point me the way to the backdoor. - All right. You guys, think we should tell her about Madison's phone? - No, not until we know she's definitely not here. Listen, me and Danielle will go upstairs. You stay here, you wait for Cornell and the others. - Okay, but please, hurry back. I'm starting to get a really uneasy feeling about all of this. - Hey, let's go. - Any sexy ladies out there? I need some pussy. Over and out. Fucking sluts. - Cornell? - Who the hell are you? And what's with that creepy fucking mask, dude? This is Christmas, not Halloween. - Madison, you in there? I knew she wasn't here, Kyle. This is strange. - Students, it's campus Officer Cornell, please respond. Officer Cornell here, I'm coming in. - This is just, I don't know where she could be. - Look, something could've come up, an emergency, I don't know. - And Sophie? - I wish I knew, Danielle. Let's just go back downstairs with Kayla, okay? - Okay. - Come on. - Mm, wait. - You guys, what're you doing? Kyle, Danielle! - We'll be there in a second, okay, just wait. - Okay. This is pretty tacky. Where's the topper? - I mean, who would send that? It's definitely not Monica. - It's just a sick joke, okay. They're super drunk. They probably think it's funny. - I really don't think that-- - We will go find them and we'll give them hell. - Okay. - Kayla, where is she? - I don't like this, Kyle. Something isn't right. - Listen, she might be outside with Cornell. - I don't know. I mean, I, we said we'd be down in a minute. You heard me, right? - Okay, well, what do you want to do, Danielle? - I don't know. I guess we can just go outside and look. - Okay, I think you're letting your imagination get the best of you. All right, everything is fine, I promise. - Okay, well, let's go. - Hello? Something isn't right. We should just leave. - Calm down, Danielle, it's probably just-- - They wouldn't all just leave, Kyle! - Okay, okay, Danielle, no, you're right. This does feel a little strange, which is why we are gonna go inside, and we're gonna call the-- - No, please, let's just go. This just isn't-- - You see, it's a joke, Danielle. That's what I'm trying to tell you. You know how Jake and Grant are. How convincing they can be. They're probably inside laughing at us right now. We gotta go stop them. - Okay. - Jesus Christ, guys, quit fucking around. - Can we please just go, this isn't-- - All right, and now I'm getting fucking pissed, come on. - No, wait. - Fuck! Hey, don't look, don't look, okay. Just look at me. If we're gonna get outta her, we have to stay calm. - Okay, okay. - Just take deep breaths, deep breaths. I would never let anything happen to you, Danielle, I promise. You bitch! You little bitch, crying and whimpering, when you're the reason this happened in the first place. Coming here, flaunting what your sister did! - What the, what the fuck? - Why, why would do this? - Because your sister killed my baby, and this sorority allowed it! They encouraged it! - Your psycho fucking daughter killed my sister! - Oh, you cunt, you see you little cunt. This is why you, they have to die, so you can feel the loss and pain that I have! And you're gonna feel some pain and some loss, trust me! - Stop, lower your weapon now. I'm calling 9-1-1. Yes, we need services to the Delta Sigma Sigma sorority house ASAP. There's been a multiple homicide. - Oh, you think this is over. Well, it's just started! - Oh, why, why? - Merry Christmas, Danielle, from our family to yours. - Nothing like the bond between sisters. Am I right, Danielle? - You two are sick! - Oh no, I'm actually very sane. I'm giving my sister the greatest gift she can receive, revenge. - Mm hmm. - Before making her pain go away for good. I see you recognize the room. Fitting eh, but it ends for you the same place it ended for your bitch of a sister! And ultimately, my sweet, sweet niece. - I'm sorry. - It's too late to be sorry, Danielle. You should've been sorry before you came to this campus and pledged this house. What did you expect? You have no idea how what your sister did affected my sister, the hate that consumed her life. Even after this, she wouldn't have been healed. I had to put her out of her misery. Put this house out of its misery. This isn't going to be quick, and it will be painful. - Well, thank you for the lovely meal, sir. - Sure wish you'd stay over. - Yeah, I know, but I gotta go get some work done, if there's any chance of me getting away, so. - Fair enough, sure your okay with Christmas in Vegas? - Yeah, of course. It'll be fun. - Okay, good, because I can not think of anywhere less Christmasy than Las Vegas. - Yeah, I guess we both have legitimate reasons to hate Christmas now. - Okay, why don't you head out. Get your work done, get packed. - Yeah, okay. - Hey. - Hey. - Everything's okay. - Yeah, adios, lover boy. - Did you really have to get the car so bloody?
