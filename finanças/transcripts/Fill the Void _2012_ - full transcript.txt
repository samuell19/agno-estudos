That's not him. Mr. Shtreicher? It's Rivka Mendelman. We can't find him. Yes Thank you. All the best. He's in the dairy section. He looks just like his father. You'll have to do a lot of laundry. Doesn't he have a tissue? Shira. What do you say? This is it, Esther. It's happening. -When did you meet? -We didn't, but I feel that he is the one. I'm so excited. I want to scream. -Screaming isn't modest, sweetie. -I won't scream, I just feel like it. Scream to God. -Tell me what to say. -When is the date? Monday. First of all, stay calm. He shouldn't notice that you feel like screaming. And second.... Esther. Do you need anything? Should I go get Yochay? It's over. Let's go home. I recommend that you prepare a list of topics. If there's quiet... ...talk about the kindergarten and he'll talk about the yeshiva. Mother, where are the keys to the safe? -Let me know how much you're taking out. -Three thousand. -Hi, Dad! -Happy Purim, sweetie. Mom is in the living room. Happy Purim! There are so many people outside. My darling. Get ready. It's about to start. Happy Purim, everyone. Ten people will come in each time. Happy Purim! Happy Purim! How may I help? I'm married with 10 children. four pairs of twins and two little boys. -I'm starting to marry them off. -Congratulations! -Are they all healthy and well? -Thank God. How many boys and how many girls? All boys. I don't know how to do it. Two children each year. Next year, two more. -Happy Purim. -Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Happy Purim. Cheers. -I'm getting married. -Congratulations. Congratulations! I'm an orphan, but I work as a teacher in the heder. I'd like to buy her some jewelry. Gladly. Happy Purim. Thank you. Happy Purim. -What's up? -Hey, Frieda. I've got some news. I'm a bride. I'm a bride. I'm a bride, Shira. -What? -Yes. -Who are you marrying? -Yosef Goodman, from New York. His father is the Rabbi's third cousin. -I'm a bride. -I can't believe it! I told you, didn't I? How long have you known? They landed yesterday. We met from 7:OO to 10:15. What's he like? I don't know. -What do you mean? -He's all right. Mother, can you come out, please? Frieda... ...may you be next. Amen. -I don't deserve you. -Yochay. -I don't say it enough. -You say it every Purim. Why do I say it only on Purim, my wife? -You are everything to me. -Stop it, you're drunk. You are my Torah. I love you. She's sick. I didn't know that when we got married. What's wrong with her? She's mentally ill. May I have another drink? It's too much to take. I'm falling apart. Redemption comes in the blink of an eye. Happy Purim. Mr. Shtreicher, happy Purim. What can I do for you? Cheers. -Thank God.... -It's not enough. Go to Goldberg, tell him I sent you. Where were we? We found a match for Frenkel's orphan but there isn't a penny left. It's shocking. Whatever you could give would be fantastic. Happy Purim. A word of wisdom? How's Shira's match with the Millers coming along? Not now. We'll talk later. Rabbi Aharon, never delay a match. We'll talk. Happy Purim. Cheers! Close the window. Esther? Esther, are you all right? Esther, can you hear me? Answer me. Esther, what's going on? -What's wrong? -Esther's not answering. Esther? -She's not answering? -Esther! Break the door! She's not answering. -She's unconscious! -Call an ambulance! -Aharon, is she breathing? -Let me through! -What's the number? -101! -Hold the door open. -Dear Lord.... I need an ambulance.... My sister.... She's nine months pregnant.... May the Lord console you within Zion and Jerusalem... ...and may you know no more sorrow. Amen. This is a temporary separation. That's what consoled me when my wife passed away. You're a widower? for nine years now. May the Lord console you within Zion and Jerusalem... -...and may you know no more sorrow. -Amen. If I forget you O Jerusalem May my right hand forget her skill If I forget you O Jerusalem Let my tongue cleave to the foot of my mouth If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy May the Lord console you within Zion and Jerusalem... ...and may you know no more sorrow. Amen. We have to hurry, we've got an hour at the grave... ...and then the circumcision. May the Lord console you. Amen. You too. Hear, O Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is one! The Lord is king, the Lord shall reign forever. Save us, Lord! Give us strength, Lord! Our God and God of our fathers... ...preserve this child for his father and mother, his father... ...and his name in Israel shall be... ...Mordechay, son of Yochay. May the father rejoice in his newborn. May his mother in heaven be glad with the fruit of her womb... ...as it is written: May she who bore you rejoice. As it is said: I passed by you and saw you weltering in your blood... ...and I said to you: You shall live through your blood. May he grow up to Torah and Hupa and good deeds. How can I help? How do I cope with the panic? -What about Shira? -Not now. Never delay decisions in this matter. Seal the deal now and have the wedding in a year. We'll give it some time. It's Yochay's mother. -How are you, Shira? -Okay. Welcome. Good to see you. Mordechay. No, it's Grandma. Mordechay. -The child needs-- -Mordechay has everything he needs. Rivka, how long will you wait? A year? It's not something you or I can decide. It's Yochay's decision. I can't believe Yochay's already thinking of getting married. It's sinking in... ...slowly. Oh, God. It's tearing me apart, Rivka. They brought it up two weeks after she died. Then it was irrelevant... ...but now.... Who is she? She was widowed six months ago. She has two little children... ...and she speaks Hebrew. Where is she from? Belgium. You're not taking the baby to Belgium. I'm not doing anything. I'm just suggesting it to Yochay. He's the only one to decide. You're killing me. What do you want me to do? God, have mercy. You can't not offer it to Yochay. Tell me what to do. Have mercy. Come in. -How are you, Yochay? -Tired. Where's Mordechay? In the yard with Shira. Mr. Shtreicher... ...this is Rivka Mendelman. Little by little. Mr. Shtreicher, please check something... ...regarding my daughter, Shira. Yes? Yes, Mr. Shtreicher? What is it? The answer is no. There's nothing to think about. I can't talk right now. Thank you anyway. All the best. Is everything okay? Amen. You're like a son to me. I'll get right to the point. How do you feel about getting married? I'm planning to, right now. You're not a 19-year-old yeshiva boy. Think about Mordechay. It won't bother you if I get married? The only things that matter are you and the child. I didn't get an interesting offer yet. Why not Shira? Is that your idea? Where'd you come up with that? It feels right. -She's a baby. -She's 18. Who could be better for Mordechay? It's not enough. Is it better to marry a stranger--? You are pressuring me. -Does she know about this? -Nobody knows about it. My son is here. -I have to feel comfortable coming here. -Of course. Enough, sweetie. Congratulations. What do you think? Congratulations. You can tell he's happy. How can you tell? What's with you? Nothing. Congratulations. -May you get married next. -Amen. I'm so glad you came. All the bachelors are stupid. True. How is it that none of them has grabbed a diamond like you? They don't think I'm a diamond. Congratulations. May you get married next. You think I haven't got a life because I'm not getting married? I never got married. Then why do you cover your hair? The Rabbi said that this way people won't ask questions. Handsome boy! -We have to decide now with Pinchas. -Patience, Shira'le. I've had it, Aunt. If we stall, the Millers will move on. You're panicking. Get a hold of yourself. I don't have the patience to wait. -You're marrying him soon. -Amen. I almost got married once. To whom? His name was Nachman. He didn't mind my arms. He himself dragged a leg. -So what happened? -I didn't like him. Hello. Are your father or mother home? -They're both here. -Mr. Shtreicher, what brings you here? -Is your husband here? -He's on his way to synagogue. -Mr. Shtreicher, I didn't have time to-- -Welcome. Hello, Aharon. -Can we talk? -Of course. The match with Shira.... Believe me, it'll sink in. It's a madhouse. I don't want it. May you have only good news. I wouldn't consider this if I didn't think they'd be good for each other. It won't bring Esther back. You think I don't know that? Then let it go. I can't. It's crazy. I really am losing my mind. Lose your mind, I'm here. It will be the end of me if he moves to Belgium. -But she doesn't want this. -How do you know? Isn't it obvious? No I can't picture an empty house right now. We have to ask Shira. Please. It's pointless. Shira, what's wrong with Yochay? Shira, nobody is forcing you to do anything. It's your decision. You don't have to decide now. -You can say no right now. -No. You're pushing her. -Look at the girl for God's sake. -Think about it for a moment. He's Esther's husband, it's wrong. We spoke to Yochay, he agreed. Enough, I think we got the message. Why aren't you marrying me off to Pinchas Miller? They called it off. What? They decided to call it off. Why? They are blind, Shira'le. They don't know you. Shira! Where are you headed? To the kindergarten. Get in. I was so sorry to hear about your sister. We were abroad when it happened. How do you feel? How is your mother doing? Not that great. I'm so sorry. I'm willing to meet with Yochay. What for? Maybe all this is happening so that I marry him. What is happening? The Millers don't want me. We are not pressuring you. Yochay is a good man, but it's your decision. I know, it's just.... I won't make a decision now. No problem. We'll arrange it. Esther once told me that if anything happens to her, I should marry Yochay. I don't know how to begin. I think it's best if we're honest. What's confusing you? I'm not confused. Okay. How's that possible? I don't know. Does it scare you to be confused? Doesn't it scare you? It made me realize something. What? That we can get married. I'm Esther's little sister. You're not so little anymore. You're pretty. What? Why do you say that? What, that you're pretty or that you're not so little? Is that a good enough reason? You want more reasons? Okay. I think you'll be a great mother to Mordechay. I don't know how I know this, but I know we'll be good together. But Esther would have wanted you to marry Frieda. Esther would have wanted me to marry Frieda? Yes Says who? Esther. -That's what Esther-- -Esther is gone. Why did you let me say all the things I said? I don't know. I didn't mean to. -I should have known-- -You're so cruel. Out of respect, you tell your parents it won't work out. What happened? He wants to marry me. What did you tell him? That Frieda is more suitable for him. That Frieda is more suitable? You sat here and told him that Frieda is more suitable? Why did you say that? This is unheard of. Would you please pour me a glass of water? How dare you, Aunt? How dare you put Shira in this situation? The girl sat with him and played matchmaker. It's unheard of. Do you have any idea how hurt Yochay felt? How dare you? -But she doesn't want to marry him. -You have no right to interfere! Listen. Aside from having the baby near you... ...what other reason do you have for this match? -Yochay is a wonderful man. -He's older. He's bringing a baby with him. Shira is just a child. You have crossed all the lines. Let her marry someone her own age, to grow up with her husband. You leave Shira alone, you hear me? Stay away from her. What if I won't? I don't want to say things I'll regret. -Good Sabbath. -Good Sabbath. I want to go to the Rabbi's gathering, can I leave Mordechay here? Of course, but first come in. -I'll be late-- -I said, come in. -Good Sabbath. -Good Sabbath. I'm on my way to the gathering, I brought Mordechay. I'll join you. -Shira, get him a plate. -I already ate. -Some dessert? -No, thanks. Aharon should be here any minute. What is it you wanted to talk to us about? I understand you know about the offer from Belgium. I do. We're going to Belgium. -Have you met the woman? -I've known her since childhood. What's she like? I can't remember. Marry Frieda. -I can't. -Why not? I don't know. Tell me, how am I going to survive this? Only with a miracle. What a terrible tragedy has happened to us, Yochay. Pray for me to have the strength to survive this. I'm sorry. About what? About what happened. I know what happened to me, but tell me what happened to you. I hurt you. Very much. And you, Shira? Nothing. Are you sure? You're too close. I could have been closer. -Good morning. -Good morning. Mom, what happened? That's it. They're moving to Belgium. -It can't be. -Is it cold in here? -No. -Give me the sweater. He can't go. He has no choice. I'll marry him. -Enough, Shira. -I'm serious! -Enough. -I'm serious! Enough. -I'll marry him. -Enough. -How many times must I say it? -Come in. Everything okay? Have a seat, Frieda. -We have to go to the doctor. -Sit, Frieda. It's time to put the cards on the table. You can never know what tomorrow will bring... ...and we've been putting this matter off for too long. We all know that this is a great opportunity for all sides... ...if Frieda marries Yochay. Frieda is too close to Esther. Yochay said it himself, I suggested it myself. Shira is closer. What are you doing, Aunt? Have you no mercy? Good manners don't get you married. Yochay and Frieda have to get married! -Says who? -Says me! But he doesn't want her! Frieda. -Frieda, wait! -Leave me alone! I can't stand the humiliation anymore, I'm only human. You're right, you don't deserve this. So respect my wishes and leave me alone. What's up? father and Yochay are meeting. Shira'le, sit over there. In memory of Esther Goldberg Why do you want to marry me? for the same reasons you're willing to. Do you want to ask me anything? I can't think of anything. Maybe you would like to ask me? Why do you want to marry me? -I already said why. -You said nothing. What do you want me to say? Whatever comes to your mind. It's the right thing to do. Like you said, I will be a good mother to Mordechay. -I don't believe you. -What's not to believe? Mom could be by his side. Stop disappearing. How old were you when you married Esther? Twenty-two. Was it pleasant? When everything was new? Were you excited to marry the most beautiful woman in the world? Answer me. How wonderful was it to get married for the first time? Because I'm giving that up. And how is your wife? It's tough but she is strong. There's only one consolation... ...in times of such agony... ...we feel the Almighty much closer. -May the Lord give us strength. -Amen. May the Rabbi excuse me, but the old lady is here again. She insists upon seeing the Rabbi right now. The lady will have to wait. I will see her shortly. -How are you, Yochay? -Bless the Lord. And Mordechay? A healthy baby. What is the matter, Aharon? Yochay and my daughter Shira would like to be married. The old lady is screaming. Send her in. How can I help you? Perhaps you can help me, Rabbi. Nobody wants to help me, not even the synagogue manager. I need to buy a new oven and I don't know what to buy. Doesn't the lady have anyone to help her? No No children, neighbors? No one. It has five flames... ...and two separate compartments. The lady can see for herself. Isn't it a little too low? Low? You think it's too low? My old oven was higher than this. Maybe it can be made higher. It seems low. How does the girl feel about this match? It is not a matter of feelings. It is only a matter of feelings. A deed must be done, and I want to do it to everyone's satisfaction. Oh, Shira'le.... Shira'le, Shira'le. Rabbi Nachman of Breslev says... ...that blessed be he who says one word of truth to the Almighty... ...his entire life. Enough already. I haven't got the strength, father. Give me the strength to get up. I can't go on like this. I can't do this by myself. You must help me get up. Stop me from feeling, father. I can't handle this pain, I'm bursting. Have mercy on me. Let me get up. Give me strength. Give me strength. Give me strength. Give me strength. Help me. I can't go on like this, alone. Come here. I'm not mad at you, Shira. It doesn't feel that way. You're right. Tell me what to do. You don't have to do a thing. -Frieda's getting married! -What? Frieda's getting married! What is going on? -Frieda's getting married! -To whom? -You'll never believe this. -What? You'll never believe this. Who's the groom? Mr. Shtreicher. How did that happen? Come, they're getting engaged right now. Mr. Shtreicher? Congratulations! -Congratulations. -Thank you. Is this real? As real as it can get. I can't believe this is happening. So you play the accordion? Yes Why the accordion? It was my grandmother's. Do you like it? I can't play any other instrument. I have no rhythm. Sorry. What kind of a girl are you looking for? Someone like me, energetic, someone who manages things. -Someone who can run things. -Sorry. What kind of home do you want to have? A real home. I don't want to lie. -Good night. -Goodbye. Good night. Good luck. If only I were able to read the signs. I can't understand what they're tying to tell me. You're drunk. What do you want, Shira? You should know that the Lord loves you. It doesn't feel that way. -That's not like you. -What's not like me? Self-pity. -Go to sleep, little girl. -I'm not a little girl. Prove it. -What do you want me to say? -I don't know. -Something real. -I have nothing to-- -You don't want to say it. -I don't know what-- What are you so afraid of? -Nothing. -Yes, you are. -Am not. -You are. -You can't tell me-- -Enough already, say it! -I'm afraid of dying. -Why would you die? Because I'm evil. Shira.... You don't know me. Look at me. You are not. Shira, daughter of Rivka Mendelman Miss Mendelman, what can we do for you? Can you pass a note to the Rabbi? If you hurry up. I have to go to the evening service. -Hello, Yochay. -I'll be back later. -Rabbi. -Hello, Yochay. -How are you? -Bless the Lord. Come in. Aharon? Come in. Aharon! -Rabbi. -Hello, Aharon. How are you? Fine, and you? Come in. You too, come on. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! If I forget you O Jerusalem May my right hand forget her skill If I forget you O Jerusalem Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth Congratulations, Shira. Congratulations. You look so beautiful. Bless me. We'll be happy. Did I tell you today that I love you? My beautiful girl. My sweetheart. Our sister, may you become thousands and tens of thousands
