[haunting chimes and synth music] [bell tolling] - Good luck tomorrow. - Thanks. - Think you'll pass? - Maybe. - What? What? [container clicks] [laughs] Going home, huh? Hm? [Jan laughs] Hm? [Eva laughs] And what about your exam, huh, huh? [dog barking] - [laughs] Where did I put my key? - I don't know, maybe here? - Okay, now I really have to go. Come to Prague with me. - This weekend? - No, to live there. - Together? - Yes, I've been offered a job there when I graduate. - I'd like that. So make sure you pass. [dog barking] [Eva sighs] - [Tereza] When I called Mom, she sounded worried. I don't know why. - [Eva] Mom worries about us. - [Tereza] Yeah, I can be hard to get hold of. I get a little caught up in everything, and then another month has gone by. I'm really enjoying Prague. - Maybe just a quick call to say you're all right. That's all Mom and Dad want. - I will do. So nice to see you. Why don't you come to live here, too? We can go out, shopping. It will be such fun. - I couldn't. Eventually, I want to move to Prague. But Jan, I'm not sure that's what he wants. - Oh, Jan. - What? - Well, he's from a small town. - So? - So he acts like he's from a small town. - Tereza, don't be a snob. - [Tereza] I've felt down lately. - [Eva] Again? - [Tereza] What are you trying to say? - Tereza, you have always felt a little sorry for yourself, but you have nothing to worry about, yet you act like an injured person all the time. - What's the matter with you? When did you become a bitch? - I'm just telling the truth for once. - You know what? Don't bother. [Eva sighs] - All right, now I'm going to get some work done, so... [eerie synth music] [people hooting] [woman moans] [animal growling] [birds cawing] [air whooshing] [woman screams] [hinges squeaking] [animal roars] [wind whistling] [mysterious synth music] [bird cawing] [bird cawing] Tereza? Tereza, hold on. [birds cawing] [voices whispering] [voice hisses] [birds cawing] [voices whispering] - [Woman] Come here. - [Man] Come here. - Tereza? [voices whispering] Tereza! - [Tereza] No, help, no, no! [screams] [blood squelches] [woman screams] [Eva gasps] - Listen to me, Tereza. Something strange just happened. I had this dream about you. - Eva, I'm busy. - This is important. You have to listen to me. - I don't have to do anything you say. - I want us to be friends again. - [Tereza] We'll talk later. - No, no, this is important. Mm, in the dream, I saw you-- - I don't care about your dreams. - One day, you'll get over yourself. I hope that happens soon. [phone beeps] [thunder rumbling] [rain hissing] [wood creaking] [dramatic synth music] [wood creaking] - Your mother wanted to come here. She couldn't get a flight. - What's the matter? - She didn't want to tell you over the phone. She wanted someone here with you. - What? What did she say? - Your sister, Tereza has been killed. - No. [Eva crying] [dog barking] Don't you want to get up today? [birds chirping] [tea splashing] [mysterious synth music] [dog barking] [cup clanks] - Oh, would you like some tea? - Yes, thank you. [tea splashing] - Did it take you a long time to drive from Prague? - No, not long, a couple of hours. - Yes. Sergeant? - Yes, sorry. Is it cold? Maybe it's just me. - So, you told me on the phone that he died. - In his cell, as though he'd just stopped living. - So we are finished with the case, then? - There was maybe somebody else involved, so I'm following some things through. Uh, there was a tape. Nemec, when we arrested him, spoke almost constantly, incoherently, mainly random words. - He was mad? - Or pretending to be. We taped him alone in his cell. The tape is unusual. He mentions your name. - My name? Why? - Maybe it's better if I just play the tape. [cell phone rings] Excuse me. I have to take this. Herz. No, I told you, I told you to call and do a follow-up on that. [door clicks] [tape whines] [Lucas laughs] - When I was a boy, he spoke to me sometimes. [air whooshes] [eerie synth music] I was lonely, and I was glad. I could hear his voice. [man speaks in foreign language] Why? But you wanted to. She had beautiful eyes. And when I saw the pain there, I wanted to close them. I couldn't look into them and see the pain. So I had to end it. [man speaks in foreign language] Quickly, I made it fast. Again, now it was over. Crumpled. Limp, silent but real. [voices whispering] Useless, I was useless there. I was waste. Human waste. Why? You never told me why. [voices muttering] [voices whispering] No, not her, not Eva. [man moans] [Eva shrieks] [Eva gasps] - Oh, was I asleep? - [Herz] Yes. [mysterious synth music] - I thought I was awake. I saw Lucas Nemec. But, there was someone else. [Lucas speaking in foreign language] - Are you feeling all right? - He, he looked at me. He looked at me. Oh, I must sound completely crazy. - [Herz] Look, if you need somebody to talk to, I can arrange-- - No, no, no, no, no, it's all right. I feel good. But I really think he was there, another person in the cell. - Nemec said some very strange things. You don't know why he mentioned your name? - I don't know. - You went to school with him. You don't remember? - No. I'm not sure. Where was she found? Was it in a, an old house, almost ruined? - No, it was on the street. Why do you ask? - I'm not sure. I just wanted to know more about what happened to her. [traffic rumbling] Are we close? - [Jan] We're nearly there. - [Eva] I'm excited to see the new flat. I'm not sure we packed everything. - [Jan] We have everything that would fit in the car. [birds chirping] [mysterious synth music] [ominous synth music] [voice hisses] - Save me from him. [Tereza screams] [traffic rumbling] [train hissing] [train clanking] - [Eva] Something weird happened today. - You did some work? - Oh. - [chuckles] I'm just kidding. - Mm. - What happened? - No, it's nothing. - How is the writing? - [moans] A lot of work, but it's okay. What about you? What about your new job? - Good. - Mm. - I just got back. - New people? - They're okay. Maybe you should try unpacking. - Mm, yes, we'll get around to it. Oh, my flowers. [siren wailing] - Do you like it here? - We have just arrived. - But your impression? What do you think now? - I like it. It's all been a little fast, really. - It's a step, isn't it? I think it's going to work out. [water lapping] [mysterious synth music] [gravel crunches] [voice hisses] [eerie synth music] [door bangs] [Eva gasps] [voices whispering] [wood creaking] - Jan. - Mm. - Jan, I heard a noise. [eerie synth music] [dog barks] [faucet hissing] [water splashing] [floorboards creaking] [hinges squeaking] [voices whispering] [floorboards creaking] - [Man] You were wrong. You were wrong. [voices whispering] [Eva gasping] [door clatters] [traffic honking] [voice hisses] [engine rumbles] [train brakes squealing] - Eva! [Eva gasps] - Petra! - You must be careful. - Yes. [pants] - What's the matter? - Nothing, I thought I saw someone, but it wasn't. - Let's go to the cafe. - Yes. I was glad when Jan got his job. But it does feel a little strange to be back here after all these years, good but strange. Plus, I have been sleeping badly, weird dreams. I haven't dreamed like this since I was a child. I find myself dreaming the same things. - What kind of things? - Tereza, losing her, talking to her sometimes. I miss her so much. - I'm so sorry, Eva. - It's okay. I like talking about her. She was special. Do you remember when we were children? - Sure, I remember. We were always playing some games and laughing. Tereza was so cute, little sister following behind you. - And did we ever know someone called Lucas Nemec? - Yes, he was our friend. [dramatic synth music] - Our friend? He's the one who murdered Tereza. - Why? - I don't know. I think he went mad. Will you come over to dinner? - Yes. - Why didn't we stay in touch? - We meant to. Prague felt lonely without you and Tereza. [Eva chuckles] But you're here now. See you. - Bye. [ominous synth music] [pen scratching] [voices whispering] [coffee maker bubbling] [door slams] [Eva gasps] [gloomy synth music] [train clanking] [train bell rings] [traffic rumbling] - Ooh, I like it. It feels good here. [wine splashing] More. [wine splashing] [Petra giggles] I feel good for a change. [dramatic piano music] - What was the matter? - Doctor said it was different things, stress, maybe. - It's hard to live here. - Yeah. What happened between you and Tereza? - We had an argument. - [Petra] What about? - Tereza was angry. She had mood swings. - She's with you. - I didn't know if it was wishful thinking, but I felt her. - No, it's true. - Petra, can you feel anything now? - Yes. She's... Nothing. - [Jan] Am I interrupting? - No. No, hi, darling. - When my mother died, her clients called me and wanted to continue the sessions. I was broke, and I needed the money. - Did it work the same way? I mean, did you get a similar result? - Do you mean, am I a fake? - Jan. - Sometimes. I can't always switch on and connect. But, I make people feel better. - Sometimes, I hear these noises at night. - Most of the time, that's all they are, noises. Nothing to worry about. - Was there ever... Did anything strange happen? - [chuckles] Plenty of times. Too many, almost. - How do you cope? - [Petra] Sometimes I don't. - And, um, how does it feel? - It depends. Sometimes it feels great, and I'm happy and able to make a difference, help people. But it's hard to switch off, and that's when it's a problem. - What happens? - It's not good. How about that wine? - Of course. [wine splashing] It all seems a little farfetched. - Jan, do you have a soul? [ominous synth music] - I'm not sure. - It's a pretty big thing not to know. - But then I wonder if this is it. Nothing else. [water lapping] - Hi. - Hi. - Mm, oh, have we been shopping? - A present. - Mm-hm. Oh, let me see. Interesting. - When we were talking yesterday, it reminded me of this book. - Mm. - Come on. [lighter clicks] I was at work today, and I was looking out of the window. I saw the clouds float past. People were walking the street down below, and I imagined myself walking out of the city, following the clouds, walking into another life. Hm. But then I remembered it was my lunch hour and I was hungry. [Eva laughs] And that this was what I wanted, a suit, a career. It's interesting. - Mm-hmm. - But I'm not sure I understand all of it. - Yeah, it is complicated. - Very, and also quite weird. - What kind of stuff? - That there is 11 dimensions. - We are so small that we can't experience them. - Oh. [Eva laughs] What else? - Hm? - That there is an infinite number. - Mm-hmm. - Of these parallel universes. - That is really fucked up. [both laughing] You know, is this weird, this stuff? Or we are just high. - It is really weird, and we are really high. [both laughing] - Yes, I think energy is important, really very important. Like oral energy. [voice hisses] [both laughing] [door slams] [ominous synth music] - Are you wearing a new perfume? - [Eva] No, I'm not wearing any today. [mysterious synth music] - Eva? Would you come here for a moment and smell this? - Yeah, you're still stoned. - Maybe. I recognize it. - Yes. - [laughs] What is it? I like it. - My sister used to wear it. [shoes tapping] [glass crashes] Is this because we are high? - I'm giving up pot. - Me too. - For a while anyway. - Fuck. - She looks nice. - You saw her? - The girl? Yeah, yeah, she's very nice. Little bit confused. I don't know where she's going there, but nice, yeah. Do you have something to eat or something? - Yes, yes. You want? - Yeah, great, thank you. - What is your name? - David. - Ah, David, I'm Eva. [apple crunching] Have we met before? I think I know you. - You don't know anything about me. - No, no. - Oh, a little bird. I saw a bird sitting on the ground, so beautiful, delicate, making little chirping noises, and then it was crushed by a dog. The owner pulled it away, but the bird was lying there, crumpled and limp. And it was done, so I had to end it. I couldn't stand the pain. I hated it, though. Why it is like that? Why? Death happens all the time. [ominous synth music] Thank you for the apple. [knife thudding] [pot clangs] [pen scratching] [animal snarling] [monkey screeching] [animal growls] [siren wailing] [phone rings] - Yes? No, he's not here at the moment. Of course. Sure, bye. [gas hisses] [Eva sighs] [door clanks] Hi. - Hi. - I'm having trouble with my heating. Do you know how to fix it? - I don't think so, but I can have a look. - I'm finishing my degree and, um, Jan is working. He's a lawyer. - Did you feel that? - No, what? - Like a coldness just went past. - I'm scared in this building. In this town. Do you feel that sometimes? - You are not scared. You are just a little lonely. Once you settle in, make a few more friends, you'll be fine. - [chuckles] You think so? - Of course. - Do you have another sandwich? - No, sorry. I'll give you something nice next time. - [laughs] You know, I wasn't always like this. I had things. I even had a house I lived in, but I didn't like it. [laughs] - I'm looking for a house. - Maybe it's the same place. - Maybe. [air whooshes] Sorry, I have to go. - Talk to me for a while, please. - [Eva] No, sorry, I have no time. - She's not there. [siren wailing] [pen scratching] [train clanking] [wind whistling] [wood creaking] [pen scratching] [shoes tapping] [wood creaking] [haunting synth music] - Have you ever felt someone behind you, looking at you, and then you turn around and see them? - No. I don't think so. - That's what I have here sometimes. I feel as though I am being watched. It's not something I think or physically feel. It's more than that, as though it's a higher sense. - A higher consciousness? [chuckles] - I know it sounds strange, but-- - I've had weird feelings sometimes. [ominous synth music] I'm not sure there is anything to it. The mind triggers sensations in certain places. - Jan, it's more than that. You're not open to these at all. - That we have something in this flat? - Not only the flat. Since we've come to Prague, since my sister died, things have not felt right. - I'm here for you. You can count on me. [Eva sighs] [phone ringing] Don't get it. [phone beeps] - Hi. It's late. [drink splashing] Petra? - Mm? - I think something else is happening. I feel something. Another spirit is with me. - Really? That's wonderful. - It is? - Yeah, you have a gift. - I would just like to see my sister again. - Your sister and I spoke to someone when we were children. I'm not sure if you heard him, too. - Yes, I think I remember. I thought you were just trying to scare us. - No. - And my parents thought you were going mad. - [Petra] They didn't understand. Most people don't. - It was just kids. We had an imaginary friend. - But you feel the same thing now. - I don't know. I feel so tired. - Do you want to stay in the spare room? - Yes, thanks. I'll see you in the morning. Yes, I will. Promise. Love you. Bye. [haunting synth music] [Eva sighs] [voices whispering] [Eva panting] [voices whispering] [Eva panting] [voice hisses] [eerie synth music] [wind whistling] [shoes tapping] [wood creaking] [wind whistling] [voices whispering] [heart beating] [electricity buzzing] [wood scratching] No! [shrieks] [voices whispering] [Eva shrieks] [Eva pants] - What happened? - I saw someone. - It's fear. That's all it is. They like to scare us so they can feel alive again. You'll be fine. [train rumbling] This reminds me of when we were kids. - [laughs] Yes. - I would come round to your house. We'd all stay up and talk, have breakfast. Go for a walk in the park. [ominous synth music] I had some problems then, some things I can't remember. - What happened last night? - Oh, do you see? Birds. How wonderful to fly like that. They're so fragile, so easily crushed. Maybe that's a part of their beauty, why people are attracted to them. [water lapping] [traffic rumbling] [water bubbling] [voice whispering] [Eva gasps] [water splashes] [faucet hissing] [water splashing] [voice hisses] [voices whispering] [faucet hissing] [water splashing] [air whooshes] [voices whispering] [eerie synth music] [Eva shrieks] [water bubbles] [water bubbles] - Is one for me? - No, sorry. Do you want one? - No, that's fine. It looks good. - Mm, I am making it for someone. - Really? - Really. [birds chirping] [children giggling] [voices whispering] - [David] Did you find that house you were looking for? - No. No. How do I know you? - I don't know. I can't remember. Oh, children. It was fun when I was a child. My parents loved me, and I had friends. I had four friends, and we used to play adventures and love, [chuckles] and we all knew him. Yeah, he had very nice house. And we would play there, trying to scare each other. - You've been there. Tell me, tell me, where is it? - Oh, it's years ago. Maybe doesn't even exist. She's close. - Who? Tereza? [ominous synth music] [David chuckles] I have this for you. - What use is a fucking sandwich? You think it's really going to help me, that scrap, huh? Just to make you feel better about yourself, yeah? You need it because you could help her and you didn't, huh? Yeah, you're too selfish to give me just a couple of coins. Can't you give me a little money? - No. - Can I have a little money? - I don't have anything. - You're lying. I don't understand why you can't give me some money. I don't understand it. You really need it? Your boyfriend will give it to you, no? He'll give you some money, to fuck you, like all the others, no? Cheating on your first love. Yeah, yeah, can you give me some money? Can you give me some fucking money? Can you give me some fucking money, please? She should never have come back here. [suspenseful synth music] [both panting] [voices whispering] - Nemec wasn't alone. Christ, it's cold. You're not cold? Anyway, I'm getting closer. [wind howling] What was that? - It's a car. What are you scared of? - Nothing. [drink splashes] I have to find the other one. - I know who it is. But you wouldn't believe me. - We will find David. Don't worry. You spoke before about an old house, a ruin. Can you tell me where you saw it? - Yes, I saw. In my dreams. - Eva, try to be careful. - Thanks, bye. Sergeant Herz came around. - Did they find David? - Not yet. - I could take some time off. - Really? - We could go home. - That's great. - I'll ask tomorrow. You can have this, if you like. - What is it? - A charm. It's for protection. [Eva giggles] - I like it. Where did you get it? - Um, I picked it up in India. Or rather, um, a yogi thrust it into my hand. He looked into my eyes and told me I would need it. - Mm, maybe he knew something. - That I was foreign and had money. - Oh. - Probably. - Oh, you're skeptical. - Just realistic. [train clanking] [contemplative synth music] [train bell rings] - I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what happened. But you were nice to me, and it meant something. Maybe we knew each other once, in a future life. [chuckles] Keep looking. She needs you. [ominous synth music] [dramatic synth music] - Mm. - What's the matter? - [sighs] I feel a little weird. - Sure. Tell me about Tereza. What happened? - She had been acting strangely, angry. [sighs] I tried to understand what was happening to her, but I gave up. I stopped caring. I couldn't stand the mood swings, the depression. She called me, said she needed me to go to her, but I didn't. And then it was too late. And now she's come back. Jan, I need to take a break. - I should get my contract in a few weeks. Shall we go then? - Not sooner? - I can't. [faucet hissing] [water splashing] [haunting synth music] [voices whispering [voices whispering [door creaks] [electricity buzzing] [handle rattling] [voice hissing] [woman screams] [electricity buzzing] Unlock it. [handle rattling] [handle rattles] Eva, the door won't open. [handle rattling] Eva, open the door, please! - Trouble? - I think we should go right now, actually. - What about your work? - They'll understand. Let's get out of here. - [sighs] We'll go home. [dramatic synth music] Did you see the bracelet you gave me? - You lost it already? - It must be at home somewhere. [engine rumbling] [birds cawing] [wine splashing] Don't you feel like shaving today, hm? - Not really. - Mm, no kisses for you. - Are you sure, huh, huh? [both laughing] [ominous synth music] - Where are you? [Tereza speaks in foreign language] [Eva gasps] [spooky synth music] - Eva. Eva. Eva! [leaves crunching] Eva, where are you going? [eerie synth music] - Jan? [voices whispering] Jan? [voices whispering] [animal growls] [voices whispering] [leaves crunching] [wind whistling] [haunting synth music] [voices whispering] [wind whistling] [Eva screams] - It's me, I lost you. - [pants] Did you see them? - Who? Eva. [ominous synth music] [engine rumbling] [clock ticking] [glass clanks] [voices whispering] [voices whispering] [voices whispering] [engine roars] [Herz sighs] [voices whispering] [animal huffs] [haunting synth music] - I know you're here. [animal growls] I'm not scared of you. [voice hissing] [eerie synth music] [birds chirping] [eerie synth music] [animal growls] [Eva screaming] [Eva panting] [Eva sobs] [train clanking] - It must be sent away. And exorcism can do this, but you need to believe. Are you religious? - No, you remember? My parents were Communists. There was no religion. - Not even God? - No. Strange to believe in ghosts but not God. - Yeah. So then no religion can help you. No priest can help you. [woman crying] [woman screams] - Jan. - Mm. - Did you hear that? [haunting chimes and synth music] [wood creaking] [metal squeaks] [wood creaking] - [Klara] Hello, Eva. - How are you? I thought I heard you. Did you call out? - I haven't been feeling too well lately. - Can I get you anything? How about some tea. - Yes. Let's have some tea. - I've met people who had strange experiences. - Hm, why is it that everyone you have met has fallen under the influence of this? Maybe it's not them. Maybe it's you. You are seeing things? - I don't know. - I spoke to Sergeant Herz. - You know him? - Of course. - But how? - He asked how you were. He hasn't spoken to you since you came here? - But I call him. - Are you sure? [voice hisses] [wood thumps] - Did you hear that? [wood thumps] - What, my child? - That noise. - I can't hear anything. [wind chimes clinking] [spooky synth music] - Klara. Klara, look. - Oh, is it chilly for you? I should close the window. That's better, hm? - You didn't actually close the window. - Of course I did. - I should leave. - Why? Desperate to run after that good-for-nothing gangster? You want to keep me up all night? Selfish cow. Why are you so fucking selfish? - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about! Why have you left him with me? [wood thumps] You will join your sister soon. [metal rattling] He's here for you. [door bangs] [wood thumps] No, don't go. [Eva panting] [door slams] Eva, let me in. I need help. You know this. Eva, please. Help me. Don't leave me out here. [door thumps] Eva, your sister needs you. She's here beside me. Tereza called on me. [door thumping] You're here now. That's good. [lock clacking] [door thumping] [Eva panting] - Jan. Should I call the police about what happened last night? - I don't think you need to. - She may, I don't know. She could injure herself. - It's past that. - What? - I went around there earlier to see if she was all right. - What happened? - I just called an ambulance. - And how is she? - Not too good. She's dead. [haunting synth music] - Oh, fuck. I'm going to look. - No, Eva. The ambulance will be here any minute. [wood creaking] - [Klara] Eva. - Klara? Klara? [Klara gurgles] [voice whispering] [Klara gasping] Did you see the look on her face? - Not really. - She was horrific. - Dying is not pleasant. - Sure, but I am worried about asking him. - These were old people who died because it was their time. If anything else, it's just-- - What? Crazy? - I don't think you are crazy. But there is another reason for this. [keys clinking] - Eva. - Oh, yes, sorry, mm, I've been checking from Klara, Mrs. Stovichova. - Yes, of course, I was just there. It's unsettling. - Sergeant, I need to talk about things. - Things, yes, uh, I need to tell you things. We found Tereza in an alley next to Lucas Nemec, but that's not where she was killed. I've been looking for a crime scene. I know where she was murdered. I see him. He's after me. [train humming] [ominous synth music] [birds chirping] [water lapping] [wind whistles] [voice hisses] [wind whistling] [voices whispering] [hands smacking] - [Boy] Look behind you. [wind whistling] [eerie synth music] [voices whispering] [air whooshes] [voices whispering] [air whooshing] - I found you. [animal roars] [wind whistling] [voices whispering] - [Boy] Don't say that again. [suspenseful synth music] [knife squelching] [Herz groaning] [Herz spluttering] [dog barking] [ominous synth music] [men speaking in foreign language] [men shouting] [knife squelches] [man groaning] [suspenseful synth music] - Come here! [Eva gasps] [dog barking] [train clanking] [train humming] [David panting] [train clanking] [train humming] [vehicle honks] [ominous synth music] [wind whistling] [keys clinking] [door slams] [shoes clopping] [keys clinking] [Eva panting] [shoes clopping] [keys clinking] [lock clacking] [animal snarls] [Eva panting] [shoes clopping] [keys clinking] [lock clanking] - [pants] Fuck. [pants] [voice hissing] [shoes clopping] [Eva panting] [keys clinking] [Eva gasps] [Eva panting] [door slams] [suspenseful synth music] [door rattling] [air whooshes] [hinges squeaking] [people hooting] [wind whistling] [animal growling] [knife squelches] [Eva groaning] [bones crunching] [haunting synth music] [blood squelching] [metal groaning] [voice hissing] [wind whistling] Tereza. What does that mean? - Time is different here. - I feel calm. - There is another place, but he pulls me back. - Jan, our parents. - Try and maybe you can see them. - Eva. [sobs] Eva! Eva. Eva! [sobs] [train roaring] - Come. [train clanking] - Where are you going? [suspenseful synth music] [wind whistling] [electricity sizzling] [tape whining] [eerie organ music] [suspenseful synth music] - [Petra] Sometimes I feel that maybe it wasn't right for you to come back to Prague. [train roaring] - I know. [wind whistling] [haunting synth and chimes music] - [Jan] Where did I put my key? - I don't know, maybe here? [both laughing] - Okay, now I really have to go. Come to Prague with me. - This weekend? - No, to live there. - Together? - Yes, I've been offered a job there when I graduate. [birds chirping] - Maybe. - I'll...go. - Bye. [wind whistling] [eerie synth music] [train clanking] [haunting synth music]
