The guests commented on how sticky the floor was, but Harrison told them it was only fruit punch. Harrison's friends had no idea they were actually dancing on the blood of his parents who he killed with a hammer only one hour before. This podcast is so morbid. - Yeah. Isn't it great? - Guys, seriously? We are not celebrating Parker's dirty 30 listening to an autopsy. - Okay? - Thank you. I promised you guys a weekend that you are never gonna forget. And that starts right now. Yes! Oh, my God, Parker, you're going to love this resort. Okay, girl? Ah! - I am so excited! - We'll see. You're gonna love it! Let the birthday celebration begin. Okay. This is so gorgeous. I know. Thank you. Oh, wow! Okay, perfect. - OMG. - Ooh! - This looks expensive. - Oh, it's expensive, honey. And home sweet home! And you two wanted to get an Airbnb. You really got us this comped for the weekend? Girl, I sure did. Oh, you know what? I'm late-posting one of my pictures to social media. Bailey, can you just snap this picture of me really fast? - Oh, yeah. - But hold on, wait. Wait. Let me just grab my scarf. Oh. I actually designed that to be a belt. Nice to know it's versatile, though. You are really wasting your talent on that graphics job. You should be designing full-time. Okay. Do you guys remember that consulting job I mentioned? That design house in Barcelona? - I got it. - Oh, God! Congrats! Oh, my gosh, yes! - Wait, you're moving to Spain? - Yes, but only for six weeks. Wait, hold up. Are you taking Liam with you? So, I broke up with him last night. Liam is the best relationship you've ever been in. Yeah, I know. It's just... I wanna live, like, work in Barcelona. I think you might regret it. Well, maybe we could actually enjoy this beautiful hotel instead of hanging out at the valet stand. I'd love to help you do exactly that. - Oh. - Oh, thank you. I'm David, one of the concierges here at the Hotel Evadere. And one of your biggest admirers. - Oh. - Would you be so kind? Yes! As long as we make it, you know, repost-worthy. Let's do it. Can I tag you in the photo? And maybe you can follow me back? - What's your handle? - Jungle Gym David. Okay, well then... That body does look like a playground. Well, I'm down to play if you are. All right. Recess is over. Let's go upstairs. Follow me, ladies. Oh. I love this. Oh, I'm obsessed. You know what, I really wanna see the manager 'cause I wanna just get on the same page with him. So, where can I find him? - Right this way. - Oh, here? Okay, thank you. Oh, boy. You know, I really hope the walls in our suite are soundproof, because, ew. Sorry, Liam's texting me, making sure we made it okay. Oh, jeez, what a jerk. No wonder you didn't wanna marry him. Okay, that was messed up for me to say. Yeah. Yeah, it was. I'm sorry. It's just lonely being the only married person in our little girl group, ooh, how it happened so fast. Like, I was supposed to be the Meg the Stallion, not the Michelle Obama. Are you happy? Honestly, I-it's great. But sometimes I wonder what if I hadn't. No way! - Is that my birthday twin? - Kate? What are you doing here? I live here! Well, part-time. There's, like, ten hotels that let me stay here for free. This one's my fave. So the influencer thing seems to be working, then. It's ridiculous, I just got paid in all this Bitcoin, and I don't know what that means, but my manager says I can buy any Tesla I want. Tesla's still a thing, right? Is Simone here, too? Is she still mad at me? Why don't you ask her yourself? She's right here. Hey. Is everything okay with the room? What are you doing here? It's my birthday weekend. Yeah, you should see the insane room that they gave me. Wait. Don't tell me you're staying here for free, too? Unless you try to steal this sponsor from me, you know? Simone, that was five years ago. Don't tell me you wanna rehash all that. No, no, we're not, so... Instead of being mad at me, you should be mad at all the followers that unfriended you. But don't worry. You can buy more. Hey, the hotel won't like it if you kee... I don't care if the hotel won't like it. This hotel is lucky I'm even staying here. As I was saying... Where'd they go? Whatever. Poof. I mean, seriously, guys, what is Kate even doing here? This hotel is supposed to be my sponsorship deal, not hers. Oh, this is, this is really nice. - Super cute. - Yeah, it is. So maybe just stop all the I-hate-Kate drama. - And enjoy yourself! - Right. Simone, is something else bothering you? Because after you talked to the manager, you looked a little... Oh, my gosh, guys, look at this view! Mm! Ooh, yes! - Beautiful. Look at this. - Oh, my goodness. - Paradise. - This is gorgeous. Yes. Is that, like, a party area over there? Yes. Yes. This is... Everything is here. - That's for sure. - I cannot wait... Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Try a little harder next time. - Uh... - Jeez. Since you are VIP guests, I've laid out your luggage in your rooms. Oh. How thoughtful of you. So you could go through our stuff? Well, I'm sure your ability to turn your whole body into a human jungle gym is very impressive, but we don't wanna keep you from helping the other guests in the hotel. Well, there's one more thing. - Aww. - That's very cute. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Go ahead, girl. Make a wish. Aww. Okay. May this be the best birthday ever. You shouldn't have said it out loud! Now it's not gonna come true. Oh, girl, that is a silly myth. Well, since we're already doing cake, we might as well do presents. Mm! What is this? Wow! - Real pictures? So retro. - Mm-hmm. And I even found our first Play-Doh that we all signed. From the Cabaret. - Cabaret? - Yeah. Where we first met Kate? Okay, I'm gonna turn the page so Simone doesn't rip up the pictures. You know what? Keep teasing me. And I'm not gonna give you your birthday gift. Ooh! What is this? VIP passes to Club Celestia. - The Club Celestia? - Mm-hmm. - What is Club Celestia? - The only place to be seen. Oh, perfect, because it's gonna go perfectly with the outfits I designed. And, Bailey, before you say no, this is going to look amazing on you. What's that look for? Okay, I was just looking at all those pictures and they reminded me of all those dreams I had. And some of them came true and others... May still come true. Oh, my God. Simone, please get me the tissues. - Seriously? - Yeah. You know what, I got something a little bit stronger than tissue. But these dry tears a whole lot better. You two really are my best friends. - No... - You two are my only friends. Wait, you have, like, a million followers. Mm. Followers are not friends. Trust me. Yeah. But I say let's make a pact. No more talking about Kate or Liam and no talking about how Simone is gonna probably sleep with the concierge tonight. Um, I'm highly offended because I doubt there's gonna be any sleeping involved. Cheers. All right. This way! Let's go, birthday girl. Come on. So why don't you guys let me know when you really want to party? Oh, my God, are those ecstasy pills? - Mm-hmm. - Bailey! You're not supposed to have that stuff. You're a mom! Okay, look, a mommy in my mommy-and-me class hooked me up, and it's not like I'm asking you to freebase heroin or something. Not yet anyway. Oh, well, look at the time. - Time to go to another club. - Okay, sit down. I'm turning thirty, not three. And besides, Kate was one of our closest friends in college. And she was trying to be nice to you before you got all up in her face. Parker's right. You're the only one holding the grudge on this. You're right. Hey, Kate. Maybe it's time we made peace. So let's toast to new beginnings. - Rachel, film this. - Wow. Is this actually a ceasefire? When did they start beefing? Because I really can't remember. Was it before or after the influencer stuff? Oh, definitely before, when Kate became her understudy in Rent. Simone would've been my understudy, but I didn't have it in me to sleep with the director. Old fat guys aren't my type. That was you? You're the one who was spreading all those rumors about me sleeping with the director? My dad heard those rumors, Kate. I'm sorry, did you not want anyone to know? Mm-hmm. Oh... Did you get that? You throw that, it will be the last thing you do. - Oh, is that a threat? - I don't make threats, baby. - Only promises. - Okay, wait, everybody, stop. - What is wrong with all of you? - I didn't start it. - She started it this time. - You dumped champagne. - All over me! - It was an accident, Kate. Calm down. Okay. You know what? I'm out of here. I'm gonna go try to enjoy my birthday before you get us kicked out. You are in so much trouble. You look sad. They don't let sad people in here. Don't make me have you kicked out. It's stupid personal drama. Mm, my favorite kind. Oh, well then, you'll love my friends because they're in there fighting like a bunch of juvenile delinquents right now. Yeah, but... that's not what's really bothering you, is it? The perfect man wanted me to marry him, and I broke up with him. Why? What did he do wrong? Nothing. In-in fact, he did everything right. He would've done anything that I asked him to do. No questions asked. What a jerk. Seriously, what a jerk for asking you to run his life. Yeah, there was no adventure, you know? You want someone who's confident. A man that runs her own life. You don't seem that bad. I'm not quite sure that I could handle you. Hey, Zac, two bottles of tequila. Thank you. - Aren't you gonna pay for that? - I already did. - I own the club. - Oh? Hey. Where'd Bailey go? Um, she went to the bathroom. Where'd, um... - Oh! - Hi. Peaches! It's nice to see you. Wait a minute, is she the one who's fighting with your friends? Peaches, I pay you to draw in a crowd, not to divide it. Screw off, Antonio. Wait, so you two know each other? Antonio, could you please ask this lady to leave? No, actually, Kate, you should leave. Tell you what, why don't you both stay? If you kiss and make up, I'll comp your bottle service the rest of the evening. I'm game. Free bottles all night, no charge. That's what I said. Top shelf only. - Ah... - Love you. - Yeah. - And that's how you make peace. Hi. Excuse me, sir. Hi. Who's that? What's this? Okay. Well, since the party has already gotten started, um, you wanna, you wanna do this or no? - Okay. - Yeah. Happy birthday. Hm. - Hey. Wake up. - Hm... Wake up. We're in, we're in Kate's room. How did we get in here? - My phone is dead, guys. - Ooh. No, girl. - Sorry. - Shh! - Don't wake up Kate. - Shh! Where's the... - Okay. - Careful. - Simone! - Simone, no. - Okay. All right, yeah. - Shh! Excuse me, ladies. All right. You think somebody drugged us? Yes. You did. No, I think the question is, was it laced? Okay, I highly doubt the president of my mommy-and-me club was trying to drug us, so... Hello? Anyone in there? It's Detective Lee. - What's going on? - Hey, David, David. Um, what's going on? A dead body was found near the pool early this morning. - Oh, my God. - Someone of the hotel? Well, it's not confirmed, but word on the street is that it's Kate Alessa. - Our Kate? - Well, we're pretty sure. She fell off her balcony before dawn. Or she slipped or was pushed. We don't know yet. - Oh, my God... - Poor Kate. - To die alone like that... - I know. She was so happy to see us again and be friends. Oh, well, not me. She thought I hated her. But I mean, she, she said that she forgave me, but... Was that, um, before or after you screamed at her at the club? Thanks, Bailey, I-I feel terrible already, but thank you. Why are we arguing about this? Because the cops are gonna bring it up when they're looking for suspects. But she fell. It was an accident. So suicide? She jumped? We really better hope it's a suicide. - Bailey! - What? If it wasn't a suicide, then it was a homicide. And we were the only people in her suite this morning. Oh-ho-ho. Wait, no, no, no. - We didn't push her. - We don't know that, right? We, we don't even know how we even got there! We don't know. Okay. Why are we arguing about this right now? Kate just died. I would like more than two seconds to process this, please. Oh, is, um, 20 years to life in jail enough time to process? Okay, you know what, Bailey, your true-crime podcasts are, like, literally making you hysterical. No, they, they taught me something. And I've learned that the law does not care about who is guilty, it's just who is easiest to convict, and that is us. I'm surprised they even knocked. I forgot. They... The hotel gives us, you know, free coffee for the VIPS. A shot of tequila wouldn't be bad right now. - But, you know... - Okay, all right, look. No matter what happens, we have to stick together. Okay, we have to. No videos, no, photos. Not even a happy-birthday song. Oh, there is a text from Conor. He's like, "How'd it go, babe?" Should I just text him back, a friend from college died and I'll probably be implicated in her murder? It's cool, though. Just make sure Micah eats his greens. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Stop! I, I don't even remember recording this. - What happened last night? - I don't... Oh, my God! So, okay, can I see the video again? No, no, no, no. I-I deleted it already. Why? Don't we have to show it to the cops? - What? - So you can implicate yourself? No, she's got the right idea, and actually, we need to go on these phones and delete everything from this trip. Where are you going? Uh, I'm not gonna stick around for this. If we leave, we look guilty. Oh, God, I think I'm gonna throw up. Me, too. I love Bloody Marys. Uh, there's crepes over there. Wanna get some crepes? Hey, is that a detective? And why is she talking to Rachel? Maybe she came for brunch. Should we... Should we go talk to her first? You know, so that, like, it doesn't look like... Look like what? Like we were involved. We weren't involved, okay? We just, well, stayed overnight in her hotel room and then woke up in the morning, you know? How would that information be helpful to their investigation? Parker, what do you think? - Where are you going? - Maybe he knows what happened. Oh, my God. Sorry. Tapped out on requests. You were in Kate's suite last night, right? I was barely there, all right? Antonio asked me to bring some party favors. Drugs. To knock us out? If you're a narc, you suck at it. Look, I just really wanna know what happened. You really don't remember, do you? You know what? Good. You may not like what you remember. Did he tell you anything? Yes, Parker. Do tell! Who are you? Detective Sharon Lee. And you are Parker, Simone and Bailey. The concierge told me. - Nice guy. - Well... We would love to tell you everything that happened last night, but we were drugged and blacked out, so... Hm. Did someone roofie you? We don't really know. Well, have you done a drug test? That way you can find out what's in your system, legal or otherwise. The security footage is ready for your review. Thank you. Oh! Do you ladies have Kate's cell phone by chance? It wasn't on her person or in her hotel suite. And I already asked her assistant, but she hasn't seen it, either. Odd. Why would we even have her phone? Well, that phone could prove crucial in finding out what happened last night. Unless you ladies recorded something on your cell phones. - Did you? Hm. - No. We didn't. You know what, I'm gonna have the buffet, so... - I'm gonna go. - Well, don't go too far. This conversation isn't over yet. One for the road. - You lied to her? - Guys... - Should we get a lawyer? - No. The only thing we're getting is eggs and bacon, okay? - Chill out. Stop acting weird! - Okay. Look who's talking! Oh, my God. Wow! I'm surprised you ladies can function today after the way you stumbled in here last night. Wait, you saw us last night? Yeah. I worked a double. So I seen you all pull up with Antonio. - Who else was with us? - Kate and her friends. Eddie was there, too, Kate wanted me to come up, but I had to work until dawn, so... Did you see us taking anything or someone giving us something? Well, you were with Antonio. He's the guy all the guests call when they want something that's not on the room-service menu. - Catch my drift? - Oh. All right, I gotta get back. Oh, Simone? The manager wants to see you about your bill. Something about your credit card not going through? I don't know. I lied. This room isn't comped. I lost my sponsorship deal because they had enough influencers with Kate living here part-time and everything, so... Why didn't you just tell us? Are you lying about anything else? I didn't hurt Kate, Bailey. Parker, tell her to back off. I can't tell anyone anything right now until I get rid of this migraine. I just wanna go to the room and get some medicine. - You want me to come with you? - No. Oh, well, looks like it's just me and you, Simone. Actually, Bailey, I don't break bread with people that accuse me of lying. - But you did. You said so. - Whatever. Bailey... God! Leave me alone! Shh! Somebody killed her. I am so... - Hi. - Are you staying here, too? Something like that. What did you give me last night? Besides a good time? Look, my friends and I blacked out and David said that you deal all... Quiet. The only thing I gave you last night was too much attention. Then why can't I remember anything? You know, I can't remember anything about last night either. Antonio? Look, Parker, I need you to stay away from me. Stay away? Right. But last night... Was last night, and now it's over. It's not personal. - What was that? What was... - I need you to keep it together. - You need to... You need... - We'll talk about this. Now stop it, now. Stop it. I thought you two were staying downstairs for brunch. Oh, my God, this migraine is gonna be with me for a few hours. What areyoudoing here? What do you know about my husband? I don't even know who your husband is. You were all over him at the club last night. Antonio? Oh, my God, Antonio's your husband. You need to leave. What do you know about him and Kate? You need to leave before I call security. Go ahead. I own the hotel. Well, co-own it with Antonio. Same with Celestia. My dad gets migraines, too. Ice works best to numb the pain. I didn't know Antonio was married. I don't want any trouble. Some might say we are in an open relationship. You've got more, um, substance than my husband's usual conquests. You mean Kate? You know, if it weren't for you, Kate might still be alive. I won't take another one. It's gross. She just died. Rachel, nobody will know how devastated I am unless I post a picture proving it. Go. Okay, fine. I'm just gonna get David to take one if you're not going to. Aww, wouldn't you be more comfortable in the kiddie club section with the other mommies? Does your mommy know you're down by the pool without adult supervision? Do you want me to call the room? I can call your mommy for you, little girl! Hey. So what'd you think? It's my work outfit for the San Vernay. - It's next door. You wanna come? - Wait. You're a concierge over there, too? Nah, they pay me to model. I pretend to be a guest by the pool to make it look cooler than it is. But aren't you exhausted from being up all night? Strangely... nah. But the job pays 1000 for four hours. That'll help you with your hotel bill. Yeah, I got to figure something out besides influencing, because it's not working. It's a racket, really. Well, I know another way out, and it pays well. I didn't kill Kate. - I didn't say that you did. - Well, frankly... You're saying a lot of things that don't make sense right now, like this whole open-relationship deal. It worked until his precious Peaches wanted more. I told him he should end it with her before something or someone drove her over the edge. When Antonio picked you over her, Kate was furious. She only led you into her hotel room to get Antonio to come. He didn't want her. He didn't desire her physically anymore. Women like Kate don't take that kind of rejection easily. And Kate turning 30, well, she wasn't ready to grow up. Nor was she mature enough to let go. There were many more suitable men for her than Antonio, but she was so angry at him, had to make sure he never forgot her, even if it killed her. Okay. How do you know this happened? Because that man is my world, and I am determined to prove that Kate took her own life. So please, tell me what happened last night in her suite. I don't remember anything. All right. Well, if you do recall anything, you know where I am. Wait. How do you know that Antonio didn't kill Kate? Antonio may be a lot of things, but he is not a monster. Cairo was wild. Kate actually crawled inside a sarcophagus. Wow! I am not surprised. Kate actually did not turn down any dares in college. Yikes! We're late for the photoshoot at the pier. I hope Kate... What am I gonna do without her? She was my life for so long. Well, uh, it's gonna take time. But now you can focus on your own life. - I'm not glad she's dead. - Of course not. No one is. I have my own room. I wasn't even in her suite last night. Okay. Why are you getting so upset? Why are you even talking to me? Because this is a really terrible thing and we all just need somebody to talk to. I shouldn't even be down here. I-I need to cancel her schedule. People will still be mad at me that she can't show up. God! Kate stresses me out even when she's gone. You should see a counselor, though, at some point. So you're a hustler? I wouldn't say all that. More like a masseuse with benefits, you know? Okay, David, I know you're cute, but intercourse, it's just, it's never gonna be a massage technique. Sorry. I don't go that far, unless they pay me for it. Well, how much do they pay you? Just, uh, out of curiosity. Well, come with me next door and find out. - I'll introduce you to my frie... - Uh, no, actually. I'm just, I'm confused. Forget it. You enjoying your birthday weekend so far? - Mm-hmm. - You know, besides the, uh... You know... Yeah. Uh... All right, I'm gonna go. - Mm-hmm. - All right. Do not take what he's offering. Do not play dumb with me. He just asked you to become a hooker. I'm a whore anyway, aren't I? No, seriously. Pimping myself out for likes, views, comments. Free hotel rooms. Well, when they are free. And it's not gonna last forever, Parker. Every day I'm getting older and less on trend. And all it's gonna take is one bad photo or one wrong comment, and everyone can be take everything away from me just like that. I just, I can't, I can't do this anymore. - So don't! - So what else would I do? - Parker... - Look, we're tired, okay? And Bailey was wrong, and I propose that we find her and do what we say we've been wanting to do all along, which is go home. - Okay? - Yeah. Come on. You are not gonna believe the conversation I just had with Kate's assistant, Rachel. That girl, wow! Well, I can one-up you because I was approached by Antonio's wife. And she knows about the relationship he was having with Kate behind her back. She even knew his pet nickname for her, Peaches. Do you think she pushed her? I mean, scorned love is, like, the number-one reason for homicide. This podcast I listen to... - Okay. No more podcasts. - Always... No more confrontations, no more conspiracy theories. Simone and I agreed that it's just time that we leave. N-no, but it... No, no, no. No! We tried it your way, and it gave me a splitting headache and it gave Simone pretty much a nervous breakdown. Kate, are you drunk? You know why I stopped talking to you, Parker? It's not because you're friends with Simone. Okay, it's because you make everything about you. Who was the center of attention at my birthday party? You. It's my birthday, too! But these are my friends, Parker. Just stop! Why do you hate me? You come into town. - And you ruined my birthday. - Look at that. By stealing Antonio away from me. I didn't even know you two were together. I mean, come on! You can have him, trust me. Oh, so now you're, you're giving him to me? Kate, are you drunk? You know why I stopped talking to you, Parker? It's not because you're friends with Simone, okay? It's because you make everything about you. Who was the center of attention at my birthday party? You. It's my birthday, too! But these are my friends, Parker. Just stop! - Who posted this? - I don't know. It's already been viewed, like, 500 times. And, look, the source is anonymous. Well, who else was up there, because this didn't come from any one of our phones. Well, it wasn't Rachel because I talked to her and she said she wasn't even there. I bet it was that creep Antonio. Why? To shift the blame off him and frame you, duh! Okay, at some point we have to stop with the conspiracy theories, Bailey. No, you know, she has a point. You know, Antonio's always looking for a back to stab. And I'm not about to let him shine that focus on me, okay? My probation officer would freak out if she found out I was up there last night. Why are you on probation? That doesn't matter. What does matters is what Antonio is gonna tell the police when they ask him why a dead woman was fighting over him. So let's ask him. Wait a minute, you wanna confront Antonio? Uh, why not? His wife confronted me. Okay. Well, he's probably at the club. You know, Saturday is a big prep day. - All right, let's go. - Hold. You can't just go there without a key. A key... A key like this one. - All right. Ready? Yeah. - Yeah. I guess? Car. Hurry, I am late for my pedi appointment. You're a friend of Kate's, right? I recognized you from her posts. You were with her last night, yes? I mean, at-at the club. I wasn't at that party at her suite. I was with this new friend of mine. I have his number if you need to verify it. Okay, I'm, I'm not like going to get my nails done for funzies. Okay, we all grieve in our own ways. I know, you can't really tell because of all the Botox in my face, but... Mind if I ask you some questions? I mean, sure, but you really should be talking to those three friends of hers. Ex-friends. Theyhatedher. You know, my nails could use some TLC, too. May I join you? My treat. Fine. My car's parked right over there. Huh. Must be at lunch. Or back in storage. I'll check. Stay here. Hey. We can't go through his things. Um, it's not my fault it's unlocked, okay? Hey, Simone, look on the shelves. Parker, what's in those cabinets over there? Come on, let's go. We came here to talk to Antonio, not go through his things. Simone! Oh, my God! My bad. We came here to clear your name, Parker. There is a viral video going around of you screaming at Kate. You should be more concerned. Okay, first of all, that was taken out of context, and second of all, I don't even remember any of that. Um, that's not gonna hold up in court. But it's true! Can we just take the drug test? If we were drugged, don't we wanna know what it is? I think we just found out. - Wow! - Wait. One of these was in my purse. Did Antonio give it to you? That is not my style. We only turn 30 once. Live a little! Mm-mm. Is Kate the one who drugged us? I don't see Antonio's car anywhere. But that doesn't mean he won't be back soon. What is that doing here? You know what? Why don't you tell us? Did Kate and Antonio drug us with this stuff last night? Or did you drug us, Edward? Of course not! Is Antonio selling this? If he is, I don't wanna be here when he finds us with his stash. Let's get out of here. Come on. Better put that back. Let's go, y'all, come on! Fifteen thousand, thirty thousand, fifty thousand. What? Uh, what are you doing here? Um, uh... Waiting to talk to Antonio. What's going on with you and Antonio? Nothing. I just met the jerk last night. Wait. What are you doing here? Hm, then how did you get into his private office? Yes, Parker. How did you get in here? Are you sleeping with her? Not yet. Were you going through my things? Look, I'm just trying to figure out what happened. I'm going to leave. Or did you come here to finish what we started last... Rachel, get him off of me! - Antonio, you're hurting her! - Let me go. - Get off of her, man! - Let... Come on, let me go... Sorry... - Are you okay? - Of course she's okay. You know what, you're not gonna be. Parker, I'm gonna take you to the police department and we're gonna file a report against you. You mind if I tag along, tell them how she broke into my office? Rachel will back me up, won't... Where the hell did she go? You were trying to frame her for what happened to Kate! What? We saw the video that you posted. Wasn't me, look, just like all of you, I've no recollection what happened last night. Really? 'Cause your stash over there says something different. I confiscated that from my bartender last night. I was gonna turn it into the cops today. But after Kate's death, I couldn't take the chance of the club being implicated or get my former DJ in hot water. That's right. You're fired. Fine. Now let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Wait. What were you paying Kate for? - You are unbelievable. - I saw the invoices. Those invoices are payments that I paid to Kate to promote the club through her social media. Those invoices said merchandise, not social media. I don't have to tell you, you've to take it up with my accountant. So what now? Are we even? You wanna go downtown to settle this with the cops? Congratulations, Parker. Looks like you found the adventure you're looking for. Can we just head back to the hotel and pretend like this never happened? Seriously, fine by me. Dammit! Okay, my bag. - I gotta go get it. - Wait, wait, hold on. Wait. I think someone should. Like, go with you. No, no. I'll be quick. Okay. Well, I'm gonna take some selfies 'cause this lighting is really good. Um, I'm sorry I got you fired. Don't be. I needed to level up. Your confidence is admirable. I wish I was that bold with my achievements. What do you do? - I'm a fashion designer. - You any good? I guess. No, no, you're right. I am downright epic. You ever been to Mykonos? A buddy of mine owns a club down there. And, uh, yeah, now I have all the time in the world to sail down there. You have your own boat? It is not merely a boat. It is my home. It is my church. It is... Well, it's not much, but it's mine. Me and my pal Davey live on it together. You might have run into him working the desk at the hotel. Mm-hmm. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Uh, let's just say... He's not inviting me to play tennis anytime soon. - Okay. - Can we go? - Yeah. Where? - Well, I mean... The day is young, right? The water's gorgeous. Wait, you're not suggesting that we have, like, a river day after everything that just happened? I mean, Kate did celebrate her life, like every day was Mardi Gras, so... That's true, and keeping the party going would be like honoring Kate. - My boat's down the road. - I'm up for a swim. All right, y'all, to Kate! She was easy to hate and even easy to love. To Kate. I mean, I didn't really know that you were that close with Kate. We weren't. We barely even knew each other. Huh? Ladies, check out the view! It's dope, right? Simone, come on. Come on. I told him to keep it physical with Kate, not to fall in love. Wait, Kate was with David, too? I thought she only had a thing with Antonio. She used David to keep her thing going with Antonio. Jealousy is a strong aphrodisiac. Jealousy is also a strong motive. You think David did it? Well, didn't David work a double at the concierge desk last night? Hey, yo, gang. We got company. Mm-mm! Mm-mm! Enjoying some fun in the sun, huh? We're honoring Kate. You also were at Club Celestia. I saw you on the security tapes. - What were you doing there? - We don't have to tell you any... Bailey, stop. Let's just tell her the truth. Now, don't get too radical. We went to Antonio's office because I wanted to ask him about the video of me fighting with Kate. And did you get to talk with him? Yeah. But he didn't post the video. Anything else happen other than talking? Antonio got upset when he caught me in his office. He grabbed me and I screamed. Okay. He was hurting Parker and he's a lot stronger than me. And I didn't know what he was gonna do, so I hit him. And what did you hit him with? - Paperweight. - Round. About this big? Marble? Antonio was found dead in his office today, bludgeoned to death with a paperweight. So, Bailey Wilkinson, you are under arrest. - Wait, what? No, I-I didn't d... - Wait. No, no, no, no, Bailey... No, that's impossible. She-she didn't do it. Bailey wouldn't hurt anybody. She wouldn't kill someone. I need you to step off this boat, now. You've got it all wrong, Detective Lee. You don't know Bailey like we know her. So you've told me, repeatedly. She's like a sister to us. Why did she go back into the club by herself to see Antonio? She went into that club to get her purse. And that's hardly enough time to kill someone. Really? How long does it normally take you to kill someone? - I've never killed anyone. - But perhaps Bailey has. Was she on good terms with Kate? Or was she someone who said... What did Jaycee tell me? "I don't make threats. Only promises." She only said that 'cause she was sticking up for Parker. Was she sticking up for you when Kate got mad about you and Antonio? Statistics show that women are more protective of their peers than men. I'm sure Bailey didn't mean to kill Kate, just like she didn't mean to kill Antonio when she went back to his office. Besides Antonio's, only her prints are on the paperweight. So unless we discover something else... Eat up. There are no vending machines in lockup, ladies. Oh... - Oh, my God. - Hey! I-I know, it's-it's a lot, Don't. So I talked to Conor and he got a lawyer and they're both coming tomorrow. And Conor's being, like, so patient with me, but I can hear it in his voice, just... Oh, my God, guys, I-I can't, I can't lose everything... No, no, no, no. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna get out of here, okay? I promise. I'm so sorry. I should've just kept my big mouth shut and not said anything to that cop about what happened. No, I hit him. That is my fault. But somebody definitely went back in there and killed him after I left. And if we don't find out who that is, I... - I don't... - No, it's okay. We're gonna get you out of here. Okay, please, because it is very smelly and very scary in here. Hey, don't you ever sleep? Nah, I don't roll that way. And trust me, I am rolling. Look, I'm sorry about your friend. I can't believe she did that to Antonio. She didn't do anything. And quit being so smug about it like it's some kind of cute game or something, 'cause it's not. Sorry, she didn't mean to snap at you like that. - Oh, yes, I did. - Parker. This poor guy has probably had a really tough day. Oh, and we didn't? You gotta be kidding me. Hold on, wait. Parker, wait, um... Be smart, don't start anything. No, because of her Bailey's in jail. Uh, hey, loves, yes, I am still in mourning. It has been such a rough couple of hours. I cannot wait to go home and just chillax. Why did you say that crap to the detective? Yes, I'm gonna go home and douse myself in chocolate. - You can sponsor me. - Jaycee. Um, so anyways, thank you so much for your support. - I really apprec... - Hello! I'm talking to you. No, you're actually talking to my 100,000-plus viewers. Say hi. Come on, Parker, give us a little show. I mean, after that video of you and Kate fighting, my viewers are expecting an encore. Right, everyone? You took that video? Oh, um, by the way, everybody, I am hosting this little cabana memorial party next Saturday for Kate. Mm... You're not invited. Why would you upload that video? I'll be right back. - You really think that was me? - Who else would do that? I wasn't even in the suite last night. And you obviously don't know Kate as well as you say you did, or else you would know that that video that went viral is one of her signature peek-a-boo stories. Okay? Mind your business. Parker. These were all filmed on the same phone. Look, you see this little line right here? That's a scratch on the lens. Kate didn't take these videos. No, somebody else did. The same person who uploaded them and made sure that Kate was still trending even after her death. - Now's not really a good time. - Oh, yeah? Because it was the perfect time earlier to post this today. Are you trying to set me up? Who are you trying to protect? - Answer me! - The police were on my back. That vicious detective kept implying I had a motive to kill Kate. I-I was desperate to take the heat off me. Well, it certainly worked, because now our best friend is in jail. And not only do they think that she killed Antonio, but they also think that she killed Kate. But Bailey couldn't have killed Kate. - She was passed out long befo... - Wait. You saw us? But Bailey told us that you weren't in Kate's suite last night. I wasn't. Well, only for a little bit, just to make sure Kate... I really need you both to leave. What else did you see? I don't know what I saw. Oh, my God. I'm so stressed out, I can't even think. Knowing Antonio's dead and Kate... You know what, there's no judge and no jury here. - Where's Kate's phone? - I can't give you that phone. You told the detective you didn't have the phone, and now obviously that is a lie. Why do you keep lying? Yeah. What could possibly be in it? Kate's dead. Well, stop covering for her. I'm not covering for her. I'm covering for him. Who? Antonio. You didn't go into Antonio's office to get Kate's jacket. You took off your shoes, and you would've took off a whole lot more if you didn't catch me hiding. - Right? - God! Am I the only one that that bottle-tan creep hasn't tried to bang? Don't talk about him like that. Kate stored every message Antonio sent her on the disable app. It's an app that prevents photos and messages from being deleted from your phone. Antonio sent Kate lots of loving things and some things that could be misconstrued as threats. When Kate died, I promised him the police wouldn't get their hands on this phone. He-he was so grateful that he told me to come to his office this afternoon to thank me. With his penis? I'm sorry, but this little love story is definitely not on the level of Rose and Jack. Yes, it is. I was in love with him! Your boss was also in love with him. Is that why you had to get rid of her? And did you also kill Antonio because you found out he wasn't in love with you, and merely using you? - I didn't do any of that. - You know... You lied about everything else, how do we know you're not lying right now? Take her phone. Maybe there's something on it that can help clear your friend. The rest of you, too. What's the password? Wait. Let me guess. Peaches. Wow! Um, we really did have a wild night last night. Check out this video. Oh, my God, I'm actually... Wait, wait, are you kidding me right now? Oh, my... This is bizarre! I still don't remember any of this happening. Oh, my God! Maybe we should tell the detective. Why? So she can throw us in jail, too? Oh, my God, every time we talk to her, it just blows up in our faces. Oh, my God! I thought I got rid of this thing. Oh, jeez. You have another migraine? This entire trip has been a migraine. I'm gonna go downstairs, try to get something to kick this thing. Can you get me a soda, too? Diet! Who are you? What do you want? Yes, I'll do anything. Just, just don't show that video to... I don't have that much money on me! No, wait. I can give you half. Meet you where? Wait, who-who is this? Thank you. Elizabeth? I'm so sorry about what happened to Antonio. I mean, I can't imagine... Forgive me for asking. But why are you here? Surely no one expects you to work... I want to work. I can't go home. I can't go home, because if I go home and I see that Antonio's not there, then... that means he's really dead. So, um, I'm just gonna keep working at this hotel and... Why didn't I just divorce him when I had the chance? Then maybe this wouldn't hurt so much that he's gone. Hello? Where are you? Where are you? This is a bit odd. - How so? - Well... Here I am comforting you about your husband's death, and earlier I was... comforting my friend Bailey, who cops arrested because they think that she killed him. But she didn't. And you have to believe that. - I know she didn't kill him. - You do? The cops always look for a scapegoat in this town. They even toldme that I could be a suspect. I mean, it could easily be me in jail next. That's why I have to find out who did this. Will you help me? Yeah. Thank you. I need, I need everybody out of this lobby right now. - Did you call the police... - The police are on their way. Look, I don't know what's happening here. - This is terrible. - No, no, no. Don't touch me. Anyone who touches me just ends up dead. You still have Kate's phone? Okay, you can't show it to anyone, especially not her. - Not until we know. - Hello, everyone. Here we are again. We should start a bowling league. I, uh, need to ask a couple of questions. Oh, no. Um, could you give us a minute? Sweetheart, do not panic. I'm here. Parker, you cannot leave me alone with her, you understand that, you cannot leave me alone with her because you know what she's gonna do. We already know. She's gonna blame us just like she blamed Bailey... Maybe you should go take a hot bath. It always calms my nerves. Okay, you know what? Let's just go. Actually, can you stay and talk? No, no, no, no. She cannot. And she can't, because I'm not feeling well. I can't do this... This, this'll only take a few minutes. - I'll look after her. Okay? - No. Um... It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. David is gonna look after you, okay? Take her to our room on the 13th floor. - The room number is... - I know what room you're in. Don't worry, Simone's in good hands. Come on. A shot of tequila will do us both some good. - Tequila! - Okay. - You love tequila. You do. - I do. Okay. I got her. I got her. Mm! Let's walk. What was your relationship like with Rachel? Did you talk with her at all today? Cat got your tongue? - Do I have to answer you? - No. Not at all. But can I ask why you won't answer my questions? Because you're asking all the wrong questions. - Oh. - For instance... Is Rachel's killer the same person who killed Antonio and Kate? Isn't that enough to clear Bailey's innocence? - Parker. - No. I'm not done. Why didn't you ask Rachel about her involvement with Antonio? Or matter of fact, why didn't you ask Antonio about his arrangements with Kate? But instead, you're out here harassing me and my friends. - I don't think that's any of... - No! Instead, you come after us. Why? Because we trust the police? We tell the truth, and instead of rewarding us, you're punishing us. I'm not gonna help you with your investigation, Detective Lee. I'm gonna take matters into my own hands and clear Bailey's name. You're right. You shouldn't be answering my questions. In fact, I'd advise you to stop talking and find a lawyer, because the more you keep arguing, the more I'm starting to think all three of you are involved. You killed Kate, Bailey killed Antonio and Simone killed Rachel. If I were you, I'd find that lawyer tonight. And a good one. I can't drink anymore. And I shouldn't be laughing like this. What? You wanna cry some more? Fine. Wanna see pics of my dead cat? Stop! Seriously, stop making a joke of everything. I am, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I-I-I'm delirious. Okay. I'm sorry. You right. But, look, just take one more shot. It'll chill us both out. All right? - Uh... - Just one more, come on. One more. - Okay. - There you go. - Come on. - Hey, okay. Mm. Okay. Ooh! I hope this makes up for any inconvenience. Oh, thank you. I wish you had been the one working last night. I had to wait 45 minutes because the other concierge on duty... - Nobody could find him. - Yeah, that must've been David. He's always some place he's not supposed to be. - Well, I hope he was fired. - Probably won't happen. Everybody loves him around here. He could literally get away with murder. - Thank you. - You have a good night. Thank you for, um, for babysitting me. Yeah, I-I-I feel a lot better. - Of course. - Mm-hmm. - Um... - Mm! - Too soon? - No, no. It's too, too smelly. You mind if I shower real quick? That doesn't mean that anything's gonna happen between us, though. You sure? Not if I do this? Or get rid of this? Not to mention everything else. Okay, look, look. Go. Go, take a shower, a-a cold one 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not in the mood! - I could change that. I promise. - Just... Hey, hey, hey, when David works the concierge desk, when does he take his break? - Parker, I-I've got to go. - When does David take his break? I don't know, um, during the night shifts I usually let the staff come and go at their discretion. Well, did he go upstairs to Kate's? - Parker, you don't... - Oh, my God! Simone! E and A. Elizabeth and Antonio? You know, this shower would be a lot more fun if you joined me. Why do you have Antonio's watch? Come here. Don't worry, I'm gonna let you leave. We gonna leave together. Simone! Simone! Simone! Where's she? Where'd they go? We'll find them, together. Come on. Come on. Easy. Easy. All right. Easy. I got you, I got you, I got you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Simone, come here. Oh, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. What happened to her, man? Why are you not at the club? I got fired. Plus, the club's closed anyway. - Yo, what's wrong with her, man? - Uh, she's fine, all right? We just wanted to come back here and have a little bit more fun. She don't look fine. Ed, don't you got somewhere to go? Somethin' to do? Can we have some privacy? What's up, man? - Did you roofie her? - No, I didn't roofie her. She just had too much to drink. She's fine! - Mm. So she wanted to come here? - Yes, she wanted to come here. Bro, any more questions? - I can talk to her. - Talk to her, bro. Go ahead. Talk to her. - You okay? - Hm. She's definitely... Hey, what's going on? Get off.. I told you to stay out of it! She's headed towards the docks. Okay, I think David is taking her to the boat that he shares with Eddie. Do you track all your friends' phones on this app? Bailey made us do it after she listened to some podcast about a kidnapping in the suburbs. I thought she was paranoid. Joke's on me. Why won't the police answer? Yes, this is Elizabeth Weaver with the Evadere Hotel. A guest has been kidnapped by my concierge and-and we believe he's involved in this recent run of murders. We're tracking her phone to the Bayside Docks. No, no, we don't have time to come down and file a report. Listen, if you don't get somebody out there now, she could be dead! We're on our way... N-no. No, we don't have a gun. Y-yes, I promise. - Okay. Uh, hurry! - What? Do they not believe you? No, they did, they said they're gonna be there in ten minutes. And the dispatcher was very strict that we should not approach anyone until they arrive. You really picked the wrong place to go on a vacation. This would've all been simpler had you got a Airbnb. After all we've been through, you know what pisses me off the most? You never followed back my account. So, how you wanna go overboard? Huh? Head first or feet first? How about we flip a coin? I choose heads, my favorite. Now don't struggle too much. You might hurt yourself. Well, stop! They told us to wait! They told you to wait. Not me. Oh, my God! You really did do it? - Oh, my God! David! - Eddie. - Why? Is he dead? - No. Unt-untie him. Untie him right now. - Or what? - The police are on their way. They're gonna be here any minute. You sure about that? Yes, this is Elizabeth Weaver with the Evadere Hotel. A guest has been kidnapped by my concierge an-and we believe he's involved in this recent run of murders. You have no idea how relieved I am that you trusted me to help you. You have enough Rohypnol to knock her out? Barely. You used up most of our stash last night. You did this? You drugged us? It was always me. Call it clairvoyance or maybe a hunch, but when I saw you three show up at the hotel yesterday, I just had this feeling you would royally screw up my strategy. - Follow me, ladies. - Oh. So I had to remove you three from the equation. Compliments of the hotel. - For the birthday girls. - Thank you. Antonio basked in the freedom of our open relationship. Here we go, girls. Got some champagne. And thought I was giving him a chance to play that night. But playtime was over. Antonio's role as Sugar Daddy to his conquests was interfering with my bottom line. Mess with my heart? Fine. But mess with my money? Sorry, Charlie. If I divorced Antonio, I would lose the hotel and nightclub. But if he died, I'd keep everything. And if he died accidentally, I'd also get a hefty insurance payment. The plan was simple, once the Rophynol took effect, everyone in Kate's suite would be passed out. David would go upstairs and throw Antonio off the balcony. Everyone would assume it was a drunken fall, and David and I would split the insurance money 50-50. I didn't invite you to my party. - Where's Antonio? - I kicked him out. Listen, Kate, it's about time you ended things with him. All right? He'll never leave his wife. Oh, I'll get him back. Don't worry. Kate! So you're never gonna love me, are you? Love you? People don't love guys like you, David. They only like to look at you, keep you in a corner. You're like a nice couch, good to sit on every now and then, but at the end of the day you're just another piece of furniture that's easy to replace. David was supposed to kill Antonio, not Kate. If David was caught, he'd rat me out, too. I had to convince the police someone else wanted to kill her. But who? And there you three were, the perfect scapegoats. No one had to do my dirty work for me. You allowed me the chance to give Antonio a proper goodbye... in person. And then you had to go and steal his watch like the cheap gigolo that you are. - It's a nice watch, so what? - And that thing with Rachel? - What was that? - It was a easy $5000. I didn't know she would fight me for it. - I'll be right back. - Okay, like all narcissists... Your arrogance is your undoing. And now what? You've left me with not only two bodies to get rid of, but three? - We argue about that right now? - You are psycho! I did not tell you to do any of that. We didn't talk about any of that. E-excuse me. - We're right here. - Run! Get back inside, or I'll cut her and it's gonna be your fault. Parker, don't listen to her. You know she's gonna just kill us anyway! - Shut up. - I'm serious, Parker. Go back inside, let's talk about this. I'm a reasonable person. Let's negotiate. Oh, what are you doing? Calling 911? Very original. I'll slit all your throats before the cops get here. Well, say hi to Simon's 3.5 million followers, who are all watching you on live right now. Turn-turn that off.
