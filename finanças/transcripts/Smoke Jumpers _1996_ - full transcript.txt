- [Narrator] The following is inspired by the true story of Don and Rene Mackey, and the tragic forest fire at Storm King Mountain, Colorado in 1994. (tense music) (lighting crashing) (fire crackling) (bright upbeat music) (alarm wailing) - [Announcer] Lawson. - Yes! - [Announcer] Timmerman. Tempstead. Astral. Ryle. - All right. - [Announcer] Mackey.. - Whoa! (upbeat music) (jet engine roaring) (upbeat music) (indistinct chattering) - Mackey, you bring an apple? - A what? - Anybody got an apple for the rookie? - [Man] Yeah, I got one. Everybody does now. - Things get rough, you stick that in your mouth. I wouldn't want you to be roasted without the trimming. - [Man] He's right. - All right everybody, let's hook up, come on. (upbeat music). - After you. - [Tom] Go. (upbeat music) Go. (upbeat music) Go. (upbeat music) (Mackey laughing) - [Man] Can I get a firefighter in here. (power saw engine roaring) - [Man] I need some help over there. - [Man] I got a (indistinct). - Keep an eye up for spot fires, this bugger's hot, go. Don, Astral, if that tree falls across our line, the fire's gonna jump at us. Take it out, go. (saw buzzing) (tree cracks) - Come on, we gotta get out of here. - Thanks. (saw buzzing) - Hey guys, watch your backs. (wood cracking) Yeah! - Hey guys, good work. I do believe this line is going to hold. - Yeah. - [Man] Is that our stage down there? - Well, now we put out the fire and it started raining. The hotshots are here, we're saved. Who's the jumper in charge? - Tom Classon, good to meet you. - So how was the fire? - Well, we had fun. - Yeah, should have been here sooner. Keep telling you boys, why take the bus when we could fly? - There's still some mopping up to do. The fire line starts about 100 yards past that gully. - Yeah, but you watch out for re-burn. We wouldn't watch y'all to be taters now. - You know, one of these days cowboy, you're gonna jump outta that airplane and go splurt. And then you'll wish you'd taken the bus. - Adios. - We'll see you guys later. - You got that look. - What look is that? - [Man In Background] They're on you, right? - The look of somebody who's figured out what he wants to be when he grows up. (country music playing) - Hey, Brooke. We're outta beer. - Rhino, you can't call me rookie anymore. I made my jump. From now I want you to just call me, Mr. Mackey. - Whatever, but you're still buying. - Where's our waitress? - It ain't natural for a woman to ignore an entire table of smoke jumpers. - Absolutely. - I mean, we are after all the most desirable men on the planet. - Don't you agree, Astral? - Oh, every time I catch that distinctive smell of yours Rhino, I positively swoon. (country music continues playing) - Hey, Don. Don, beer? I had a first wildland firefighters here. Let's go buddy. (people chanting) - Oh, your waitress will get that. - Couldn't you do it? She makes them all foamy. - What are you guys celebrating? - I lost my virginity today. No, I made my first fire jump. - Oh, yeah? That's when they put the potato in your mouth, isn't? - Apple. - Why did they do that? - I don't know. Tradition, I guess. - Hmm, so how's the fire season so far? - It's hot. - Lots of dry fuel waiting to ignite. - You can pay your waitress. - Did you like to dance? - I'm a little busy right now. - I mean, after work. - Well after work, the band won't be here. - Well, we could... - Make our own music? - Don Mackey? I haven't seen you since that night we saw you went for beer. - I couldn't get away, she was all over me. - Yeah, right. - See you tomorrow night. - Night Andy. - Hi, I'm Don Mackey. - I know. I'm Rene. - So you know, I am a pretty fair country dancer. - Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Tell me about losing your virginity. - Well, her name was Suzie. She had these... - I mean your jump, wise ass. - Oh, that. It was great. It was like Christmas day, it's the best day of my life. You know what I mean? There I was jumping out of an airplane, parachuting down into what seemed like this incredibly powerful, incredibly hungry monster. Then you're down there on the ground, and you get in there and you cut a fire line with your chain saw and your Pulaski. That's this tool we use. - Oh, I know what a Pulaski is. I used to fight fire too. - Really? - (laughing) Yeah. I was on a BLM Crew for two summers. Yeah, I loved it. We'd usually get taken up the mountain in an old school bus and there'd be like a three or four hour hike to the fire. Sometimes, we'd see you guys parachuting down on the way up. - Angel's from heaven. - Oh, it's so modest. - How come you quit? - My daughter. Just got nervous about it, you know? What if something happened to me? - Daughter? - Yeah, she's five. She's with my parents from billings till next month. - So what about the father? - Long ago, went far away. - No giant lumberjack boyfriends? - Not at the moment. Turn around. - Why? - I just wanna see the label on your jeans. - Do I pass? - Not yet. Come here a minute. (country music) ♪ Too late for a kind word ♪ ♪ Too late for a smile ♪ ♪ You've gone away and won't be ♪ - So what are you do in the winter? There're no fires in the winter. - Anything to stay outdoors, go hunting, sometimes work as a guide. Go away live off the land for a few weeks. - Well, what do you know? I'm dancing with Jeremiah Johnson. ♪ And I wish knew then ♪ ♪ What I know now ♪ ♪ I take you in my arms again ♪ ♪ Make you love me somehow ♪ ♪ I wish I knew then ♪ ♪ How do keep you satisfied ♪ - Tell me about the lady bartender. - We had a certain rapport. - Sure looked like it there. She used to fight fire, you know? - Yeah? Good for her. - Classen, guess how Astral got her name? - How? - Her parents named her after a Van Morrison album. - Nothing scared and hippy parents. - Hey, hey, hey. It was a really good album, right? - When do I get to jump again? - You're on rotation. All we need is a fire. You think you can wait? - No. - It ain't much of a career, seasonal work, low pay, no benefits. - Yeah, but you get to jump outta airplanes and put out fires. - There's that and every once in a while, an appointment slot will open up, 13 guaranteed pay periods, health insurance. It's almost like a real job. - What do I gotta do to get one of those? - You stay patient. You keep your skills sharp and you wax your competition. Hey, there's your competition right there. - Rhino! - Yo! - Get those tools up here. - Coming up. (door opens and closes) - Nice. - Hey Rene. - Hey. - Brought you some flowers. - Thank you. - I always thought that yellow roses are prettier than red ones. - Me too. - Wanna go get something to eat? - I am sorry. - My friend Lori and I just made plans to go to a movie. - Well, Rene, look, if you wanna... - You should have called, earlier. - Yeah, maybe so. - But of course being a smoke jumper and all you're probably just used to parachuting it. - Flowers were nice touch though. - Glad you think so. They weren't cheap. - I tell you what, I'll make you dinner. - When? - Tomorrow night. Why don't you pick me up here around 7.00. - 7.00, all right. Nice to meet you, Lori. - You too. - As members of the most elite firefighting force in the country, smoke jumpers must keep themselves in superb condition. No ordinary mortals, they thrive on hardship. Tom, this exercise area seems to be getting quite a workout. - Well, Glenna, parachuting down to the fire is the easy part. Fighting that fire requires a lot of hard, physical work. And then we have to lug our gear out someplace to be picked up, which often means we have to walk for miles and miles with over 100 pounds on our backs. - Well, there certainly seems to be a lot of strong backs here. - Come on, they aren't butt ups. - They're push ups. - How long do we have to keep this up? - Guess till the interview is over. - Look at her man, she's salivating. She's literally drooling. - Well, the Spotter has given us our briefing. The fire down there on the ground looks pretty hot. Wish me luck. Excellent landing. From the aerial fire base in Missoula, Montana, home of the legendary smoke jumpers, this is Glenna McIntyre reporting for News Center 8. - Okay, you got it. - That was terrific. - Thank you you so much. (indistinct) - Yeah, I think that'll do it. Just a few more loose ends to wrap up. Maybe we could meet for dinner and... (alarm buzzing) - [Announcer] Classen. Madison. Rhino. - Sorry, I gotta go. - Is that a real fire? - That's right, our favorite dream. - Come on guys. - [Man] Oh, let's go. (plane engine roaring) - And there they go, these courageous young men and women risking their lives to defend our forest against fire, the eternal enemy. Is that good? Did you get that? - It's only a few acres so far, should be easy to flank. Everybody, see that burned over drainage to the east there? That'll be our primary escape route. There's also some good block on the slope just over that ridge. That'll be an excellent safe zone if we need it, all right? Let's get ready. Come on. - Here we go, rookie. Soft as a feather. - Oh man! - What's the matter? - I forgot to call somebody. - She's gonna have to wait. We got a fire to put out. (grunts) - [Man] All right, go! Go. Go. (saw engine roaring) (fire cracking) - Move back! - Take it easy, man. Get you straight up to interval man. - Sorry. - What is up with you anyway, huh? Why is it every time we get near each other, it's like duel of the Titans all of a sudden? - I don't know. Guess I'm just naturally competitive. - Behind you. - You know, I'm getting this Mackey. You think you're gonna beat me up for an appointment, don't you? - I don't know, maybe. - I don't believe you, Mackey. You just gotta throttle back, man. It's not gonna be a slide open up for at least a year. And when it does, it is going to me. - Pretty cocky attitude you got there, Timmerman. - Yeah, well, I also got leadership skills, seniority, and that indefinable magnetism that brings me the respect of men and the love of beautiful women. (Timmerman laughs sarcastically) - So, what was gonna be on the menu? - Ribeyes, big potatoes, cone on the cob. I thought he might make it home by tonight, but I guess I better go freeze those steaks, huh? - You can't count on a smoke jumper to be anywhere at any particular time except at a fire. - I've heard a lecture, Lori. - I'm just warning you, they'll break your heart in two. And that's why you gotta put 'em on the earth. So what was really on the menu? - Well, he has a 32 inch waist and a 36 inch in seam. - Guess you can't let a man with those kind of proportions escape, even if he is a smokey. - I'll say one thing, this forest fire is over! - You know, we should have just let it burn. - What are you talking about Hempstead? - I mean, think about it. Fire's a natural process, right? It clears out all the dry under brushing stuff. Whenever we put it out, we allow more fuel to collect. So the next fire that comes long will be even hotter. It's a vicious circle. - Give me a break. - Okay, I'm just telling what they said in forestry school. (upbeat music) (helicopter engine roaring) - What the hell is that? - We got a heli coming in later. Right now, I gotta get Rhino and Mackey outta here. - Oh man. - Yeah, all right. - Yes sir, take me home. - Well, I'll get you outta here, but you're not gonna like where you're going. - What do you mean? - You've been rerouted. They got a nice little fire down in Colorado. You'll only be there for a week or two. - Yeah, but I got a date. - That's life. - Bye, bye. - I'm really sorry, Rene. This is the first time I could get to a phone. - You jumping another fire? - No, they're not letting us jump out here in Colorado. We have to ride the bus in with the hotshots. - Oh, you poor baby! The bus? How could they do that to you? - I'll probably be home day after tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you Rene, really am. - Me too. - Goodbye. - Bye. (upbeat music) (plane engine roaring) - You must have some hidden charms, Mackey. - Well, I don't know too much about wine, but the guy at the liquor store did recommend this one. - I'm sure a little faith will do. - Oh, look at you, you're such a mess. I'm embarrassed to be seen with you. - Come here. - Getting pretty pathological here, Mackey. - Nothing wrong with little healthy competitive spirit. 17-16. Yeah! - Could you please play something else? Anything. (piano music) Thank you. - Hey, Mackey. - Looks like you got some company. - Who are you? - Cara. - Hi, Cara, I'm Don. Let me show you around? - Okay. - Okay. - 18-16. - Yeah, yeah, I remember. - (laughing) He's done for. - Clearly. - All right, all right. We're at 1500 feet. Streamers are in the landing spot. We got 500 yards of drift. Check the spot. You see any big boulders or snags down there? - No. - Okay. How about the wind? Is it doing anything unusual? Is it gusty? - No. - All right, get in the door. - You ready? - Ready? - Go. - Whoa! - Right, nice peel there. - I wanna do it again. - All right, come on my turn. - Yeah, I have to admit, I didn't expect you to be so good with kids. - Oh, well that's two areas in which I've exceeded your expectations. Come on Cara, let's do it again. Yeah. All right. - Good girl. - What's that? - That's Gus. We use him to keep track. - Of what? - Broken bones. Here see, July 5th, Jim Magnuson, he broke his ankle when he landed on a boulder. Here, August 8th, Tiger Ainsley cracked his collarbone when he landed in a tree. Sue Allen Snyder, September 11th, she got tagged by a falling branch. They had to put a plate in her skull. Sure gets your attention with something like this coming your way. - Hmm. - Fire that big almost looks alive. You know, like a living thing. God, I love to fight fire. - Yeah, I remember that feeling. As I recall, it was just slightly more exciting than tending bar. I could do it again. - What? - Fight fire? Cara's older now. She could stay with my parents when I'm gone. - You serious? - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't wanna be a jumper. I'm not that much old but I could get on a hotshot crew somewhere. What do you think? - You have to go through training again. - Yeah, I know that. - You really are serious? - Sure, sure. I bet I can make more money too if it's a good fire season. What do you think, hmm? - I think you should go for it. - Maybe I will. (dramatic upbeat music) - Yo, let's go! - You're standing out on the fire line. You're digging with your Pulaski. You're watching for spot fires. Seems like everything's under control. And then all of a sudden, things start to feel a little bit squirrely. The wind picks up, there's radiant heat all around you. There's the feeling of something is about to happen. You get that feeling, you get out of there. A flame front rides in on a cushion of air, maybe a foot high. But if you're caught out there with no protection, you drop to the ground, you cover your head with your hands. Maybe you'll survive, but you'll have to lie there and tolerate it while the whole backside of your body burns. And then the flames are gone. And you look around you and all that burned out grass and the blackened trees. And then you see the bodies of your friends. And you realize something, as far as that forest fire is concerned, all you are is one thing, fuel. - Did you get your hands good and clean. - Uh-huh. - Okay, good. - Is she asleep? - Yeah, your mom's been working real hard. Why don't you go on in the kitchen and start your dinner. I'll be in there in a second. - Sorry. - It's all right. You're done done in. - Don. - Hmm. - How can you not be afraid of it? - Afraid of what? - Fire. - Well, I remember once I was out hunting with my dad. We were on these switchbacks and we come around this one curve and right there in the middle of the trail, about 30 feet away from us was this grizzly. And he stood up on his hind legs. Must've been about eight feet tall. Could've killed us both easy. But that's not what I remember about it. What I remember most was this feeling I had that it was just a privilege to be standing there and looking at that bear. (people cheering) (country music) - $220 for a pair of shoes, can you believe it? - And they're so ugly too. - Oh, he made me get 'em. In fact he insisted on paying for 'em. - Oh, that's so sweet. - I know. Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamt about some incredibly handsome man coming along, take me in his arms and buying me a pair of (indistinct). - Okay, everyone. Here's to Rene. We hope that firefighting is at least as rewarding a career as bartending. We're gonna miss you and you better keep yourself safe. - [Man] Here, here! - [In Unison] Here, here! Here, here! - [Woman] Oh my goodness. - What is this? - That's a cake. - Yeah, it is. - We thought we'd give you a chance to put out a false fire here just for practice. - Yeah. - Well they didn't have any firemen. So we had to get a Ballerina. I hope you don't mind. - I forgive you. - Come on Rene, let's put out some fire. - All right. (crowd applauding) (fire cracking) - All right, we've been relieved. Get something to eat and check out. Holding up okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - This is one of those nights when an MRE and a paper sleeping bag is gonna seem like a night at a four-star hotel. I like your boots. (saw buzzing) - Thanks. - [Woman] Clear this area out! - Is that guy waving to you? - I don't know. - Well, he's waving to somebody. - Hey Rene. - Handsome man. - Hey, how're you doing? Hey. - What are you doing here? - Hit the mob last night. I caught a bus down instead of flying back to base. Can I carry something? - Yeah, how about me? - How about your pack? How're you holding up? - Okay. - You sure look sexy in your uniform. - I do, huh? - Yeah. Particularly your boots. (Rene chuckles) (soft upbeat music) - It's beautiful, huh? - Yeah. - You love me Don? - Yeah, I do. - Just curious 'cause I love you. - Been thinking about it, you know, getting married. - What's the old brain tell you? - Tells me this would be a pretty spectacular night to propose, don't you think? - If you were so inclined. - Well, I guess I'm inclined. - Well, could you be a little less romantic? It's embarrassing. (both laughing) (country music) (indistinct conversing) - It's a beautiful wedding. - Hey, thanks. Didn't you think so? - It was alright. - All right. - It's not just fire we gotta deal with, you know. There's smoke and burning snags, rocks. You know, I almost got smacked in the head by a turtle. - By a turtle? - Yep, these choppers were scooping up water out of the creek to dump on the fire. Damn if they didn't scoop up a turtle, drop it on my head. - Did you notice what species, Rhino? - What species? - Yeah, red-eared, slider, stinkpot, come on. - What do I care what kind of species it was, all right? If I hadn't been wearing my hard hat, I'd be dead today. - You know, it was probably a killer turtle. - Wow, look at that. - [Announcer] On your mark, get set, go! (crowd cheering) - Clocking in at 52 seconds. Next contestant. - Right here. - Ah, Timmerman. Oh, here we go again. Ready? On your mark, get set, go! (crowd cheering) - Come on buddy! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah! 46 seconds. - Whoa! - Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion. Whoa! - Can't allow that. - Oh, yes you can. - No, just take a minute. Hold this for a second. - Oh, man. - Wait a minute, one more contestant. - Whoa! Look out Timmerman, your title's in jeopardy. - Yep. - Okay, are you ready, sir? - I am ready. - All right. On your mark, get set, hell yeah! (crowd cheering) That Mackey must be half ape. Look at that. - Come on Don, hurry. - Oh, man. - Hey, let me help you up there old man. - You know me, always gracious in victory. (Timmerman chuckles) Ah, well that's too bad. And on his wedding day too. (both laughing) I'll get you next time. - Ooh, I don't know about that. You're a married man now. You've got all sorts of responsibilities. Me, no responsibility. I've got a snag in that appointment. Rene, you know, I was just telling your husband how fond I am or slow dancing to this kind of music. - Well, in that funny Timmerman. You know, I'm quite fond of that myself. - Shall we? - We shall. (crowd applauding) Thank you, thank you. Ah, I was right. Here, see? See a little mark down there looks like a tadpole? - Yes. - That's deer track. Didn't come far from the tree line but he cautious. Must have been a buck. - What was he doing here? - Snooping around. Okay, see he was rubbing his antlers against this tree here. (door slams shut) - Where is it? - It's over in Bob Marshall wilderness. Good thing you're off rotation. You can babysit. - Are you gonna be gone a long time? - Oh, no sweetie. This is a small fire. I'll probably be back to pick you up from school tomorrow. Then if I'm not, Don will take you over to grandma's, okay? - Okay. - Okay, you be good for me, okay? - Okay. - I love you. - Take care of yourself. Come on Cara. Let's go see if we can track us down chocolate milk. - Yeah. - Yeah. (tense music) (whooshing sound) - What was that? - I don't know. (fire rumbling) - Let's get out of here, come on. This way. - Whoa! Get out of there. Back this way. Let's go, come on, come on! Hurry up! - No, forget it, over here. - Come on, let's go down there. It's over there. Go, go! (fire rumbling) - Hurry! - Let's go, let's go, come on! - Over there! - Back over here. - We go this way. Hurry up! - Get over here! Come on this way. - Let's go, come on, hurry! Let's go. Down there, down there, come on. (fire roaring) Come on, go, go! Go, come on! (fire continues roaring) - There's a break over here. (man screams) - Come on, get up. Pull him out, pull him out. Hurry up, come on! (tense music) (car engine roaring) (helicopter rotors whirring) (car tires screeching) (distant conversing) - You're all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. Nobody expected it to be such a big deal. And then all of a sudden the trees started torching at it. We couldn't hold the line. - Is he gonna be okay? - They think so. Oh man, I was scared, Don. - I know. - My shoe lace is burnt up. - You kept your head. That's what matters? - No, I didn't. I wasn't thinking at all. I was just running. All I knew was I didn't want Cara to grow up without me. - It's all right. - No, it's not. - You're in shock. - Will you listen to me? I know I'm in shock. I know I've had a big scare and I know that it happens to everybody. But I guess I'm just not as much like you as I thought. I don't want to do it anymore, Don. I mean, I know it was great. Both of us fighting fire and it brought us together in this really special way, but we can be together in other ways. I mean, there's too much on my mind when I'm out there. There's you and Cara and somebody else, I think. I think I'm pregnant, Don. (Don laughs excitedly) - That's great. Man, what a surprise! Now on I'll fight fire for both of us. (soft upbeat music) - Hey. - Hey. She woke up, she wasn't hungry. I guess she just wanted somebody to hold her. How're you feeling? - Like I died and went to heaven. - Tom, it doesn't really hit you till you're actually standing there holding 'em. You think, "Whoa, it's a miracle." - Must be something. - Oh, it is. And I can't believe the strength of women. I've never been so proud of anyone in my whole life. She had something to do and she did it. (Tom laughs) How come you never thought about having kids, huh? - Well, it's crossed my mind from time to time but every time I try to be domestic, some woman winds up yelling at me that I'm a cold-hearted son of a bitch. - Oh, Glenna thinks you're cold-hearted? - Single-minded. But sooner or later a woman will figure that's the same thing anyway. - You know, looking down at that helpless little baby, I couldn't help thinking about those 13 pay periods. - Well, don't tell anybody, but Astral is leaving at the end of this season. - Why? - She wants to get her doctorate, which means a slot will be open at the end of this month. Of course a lot of guys are gonna want it. Not just you and Timmerman, but you know some of the jumpers from the other bases. - What do you think my chances are getting it? - Well, you're an outstanding jumper, you put in the effort, you're well respected, but who knows, you know? It's not just up to me. - All right. Come on, give the old man a hand here. - Come on, this is (indistinct). - Come on. - Get it up. Come on, old man, push. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's easy. - Come on, get it up, get it up, real strong. (alarm buzzing) - [Announcer] Astral. Tempstead. Timmerman. Classen. - That's us, get out of here. Come on. (bright upbeat music) (helicopter rotors whirring) (plane engine roars) - They're diverted again to the Wasatch mountains. - It's a bad summer for fires. - Yeah. - Looks like somebody's clocked out. - Thinks he'll be home in a week. Unless of course there's another fire. (alarm buzzing) (plane engine roars) (upbeat music) (helicopter rotors whirring) (plane engine roaring) (car engine roars) - Dad! - Hey, how you doing pumpkin? - Hey you. - Oh, look how big she got. - Three months will do that to a baby. - Oh, she's heavy as a bowling ball. - Hey, you should see my biceps. You'd be proud. - Yeah, I bet. - So you wanna come in? - Yeah, I might have time for a quick visit. (soft piano music) She sleep? - Yeah. - I thought she only got up once a night. - Yeah, well, now she gets up twice. - Sorry about being gone so long. - It's not your fault. Fires happen and you gotta put 'em out. Did get a little lonely around here this summer though. - We'll be together all winter. I think we should do some work on the house. - Tell me about the fires you fought. - We had a couple that got our attention. - You ever need your shelter? - No, nobody had to deploy all summer. There were some good fires, though. Excellent fires. - Excellent fires. Guess you don't have it outta your system yet. - No, Rene, I don't have it out of my system. - Hey you be careful now Astral, huh? Take care, okay? I hear those graduate schools are hotbed of feminism. - Come on, baby. - Bye, right now. - Take care. - Take it easy, right? - Yeah. - Bye, Askey. Take it easy now. - Mackey, oh! You ever get lonesome for a fire, tough guy, you know where to find us. - Drop your snags, all right, Mackey? - Ah the moment of truth is drawing nigh, Mackey. - Now's not the time for it, Timmerman. - No, what is this? Come on, a little nervous? You're scared? Come on. Come on, man. - Hey, hey, hey! - Mackey, let him go! - [Man] Come on, you guys.

I can't believe you let Don go hunting when you're having a baby in less than a month. - It's not that I mind him going hunting. I mean, he's earned it. Never seen anybody work as hard as he did on that house. You just think he'd wanna stick around a while and enjoy it. - Maybe you oughta call him on it. - Yeah, I could just hear myself. "Jeremiah Johnson, you come out of those woods right now and wash up for dinner." (Lori laughs) I don't wanna be like that. It's nice when we're all together, you know, watching the snowfall. - He likes it too. Just in smaller doses. - Yeah, I know he does. It's just that he's antsy all the time. Antsy for a fire. - Don't you wanna come in? - I just wanna sit out here a minute. Hand me the baby. - Yeah, okay. - Told Lori we'd pick up the kids before dinner. - Let's just sit here. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little tired. It doesn't get any easier with the third one, you know. - You did great, tough guy. - Oh, look at him. So fragile. I've been thinking, life is pretty fragile, you know? Now it's about to start all over again. I'm sorry. - It's all right. Wet winter, not gonna be much fire activity. I'll probably just be hanging out at the base most of the summer. - This summer. - Why don't you come on inside. - I haven't lost my nerve, you know? - I know. I know that. (alarm buzzing) - [Announcer] Rhino. Timmerman. Tempstead. - It's Christmas boys! (upbeat music) (plane engine roars) - Timmerman's in trouble. Timmerman. Timmerman's caught across wood. (Timmerman groans) Timmerman, where are you buddy? Timmerman! (Timmerman groans) Timmerman! Timmerman, you hear me? Timmerman! Timmerman! Timmerman! (wind blowing) Timmerman! - Over here. - How badly are you hurt? - My legs are broken. - Let's get this thing off. (helicopter rotors whirring) - One, two. (Timmerman groaning) - Thank you boys for escorting me out. - No problem. Next time we'll be a little more gentle. - Mackey. - Yeah. - I guess I'm out of the running, man. - No, no, no. It all depends on how fast spring bring back. - But it ain't gonna be fast enough. Anyway, I always thought that you got a great shot at that appointment even though I am clearly the superior being. - You take care man. - Talked to Timmerman on the phone. - Yeah. - They're moving him to some rehab hospital in Denver. - How'd he sound? - Upbeat. - You think he's gonna be back? - I doubt it. The committee met the other day about what to do with that appointment. I was pretty sure it was gonna go to you, but it didn't. You were my first choice. I want you to know that. - Appreciate that. - The problem was I was only one vote. - Just outta curiosity, who did it go to? - Hempstead. - Hempstead? - Yeah. - He doesn't even believe in fighting fires. He thinks he should just let the forest burn. - The committee was very impressed. He's a good firefighter plus he's got a degree in forestry. - Oh, a degree in forestry. That's gonna do him a lot of good when it's gotta blow up right in front of his face, yeah? - Don. - I really wanted that appointment, Tom. - Just maybe it's time for you to start looking for another line of work. - No, no, no. It's not time till I feel like it's time. Thanks for going to bed for me with the committee. Appreciate that. (telephone ringing) Hey, Hamstead. - Hey, Mackey. - Just heard about your appointment. Wanna say congratulations. - Thank you, man. - Yeah, proud of you. - Yeah. Hey, just for that, let me buy you a beer. What do you say? - No, you know, I gotta get showered. Get back to the kids. I'm really proud of you though. - All right. - Just like any other bureaucracy, all they care about are credentials and diplomas. Never asked themselves, "Hey, can this guy fight a fire?" - I thought Hempstead was a good firefighter. - He is. Not as good as me though. Probably be a year before another slot comes up. - Don, maybe you could think about another job. - Yeah, that's what everybody's telling me all of a sudden. - Look what happened to Timmerman. - Rene, I'm not gonna let your fear decide what I should do or who I should be. - All right, Don. Let's forget about fear. Let's be practical. I mean, what about a reliable income? We can't all live on my salary and tips. I mean, at the end of the summer, you'd be laid off anyway. What is the point of sitting around feeling useless? - I don't feel useless. - That's not what I meant. - For your information Rene, I can jump out of an airplane at 1200 feet and I can land in a clear size of this porch and stop a 30 acre fire in its tracks. That's a pretty useful thing to be able to do, wouldn't you say? Just 'cause I've accumulated a little more baggage than the average smoke jumper doesn't... - Baggage? - You know what I mean, responsibilities? - Oh no, you meant what you said, baggage. And I guess you're right too. It's a lot easier jumping out of that plane without a wife and three kids, isn't it? - Come on, Rene. - A lot more fun too, I bet. (thunder rumbling) - Finally I got him down. Had to pat his back for about an hour. What do you got there? - Peppermint tea. - Guess you're not gonna offer me any. - I guess you're right cowboy. (thunder clapping) - The thing is Rene, I'm a firefighter. I'm a wildland firefighter. - I know you are. I'm not asking you to stop being you. - Yes, you are. You just don't hear yourself, but that's exactly what you're asking. - No, you just don't... Look, the thing of it is, for these past few months, while you've been bouncing off the walls. Well, they've been just about the happiest time of my life. Having the kids to take care of and the house to fix up, and us being together every day. I feel complete, you know? And I just wish you could feel complete too. (thunderclap continues) - The forest ought to be pretty dry by now. Nothing but fuel. - Well, maybe you'll get your boomer somewhere after all. - Don't you wanna stay and watch the storm? - No, I'm going to bed. You watch it for me. (thunderclap continues) (car engine roars) He loves kids and he still loves me, I'm sure of that. We just don't connect anymore. - Well, you're not the first woman in the history of the world who's ever had this problem with a smoke jumper. Thing they're designed for is putting out fires. Everything else is an afterthought. - I just got this shield around me. I don't mean to put it up, but I do. - Tell the doctor why. - I suppose I'm afraid. Afraid of what'll happen to him out there on some fire. Maybe he feels it too. Maybe that's why we're keeping this distance between us. So, tell me Dr. Lori, what do we do? - Why don't you hop back there and get us a couple of beers. - Good idea. - Gotta run. There's a pretty big fire over in Big Bar. They want us in the air by 8.00. Catch you guys later. - Just some, just some coffee. - Thanks. - We gotta do something about this situation. - What do you mean? - We're both miserable, Don. - That'll get better. - No, it won't. It can't All I ever wanted was Don Mackey. But to be with him, to be with him the way I want, I'd have to change him into somebody else. And then I wouldn't have Don Mackey anymore. Look, the thing is fighting fire is what makes you feel alive. I don't wanna take that away from you, but if we keep on like this, I will. - Maybe we should think about it. Talk about it. - Oh sure. Yeah, we'll think about it. We'll talk about it. And then a year from now, we're gonna be standing out here having the same conversation all over again. - Are you talking about like ending it? - You tell me, what do you wanna do? - I don't know, I don't know. - I don't know. Not exactly the most powerful statement you could have made. Gotta go to your fire. - You're not the first smoke jumper who's had to move in here in times of domestic crisis, you know? If I were you, I'd wash the sheets, just to be on the safe side. Got the refrigerator hooked up. Most of the burners on the stove are working now. So, basically it's a little piece of heaven. - I really appreciate it, Tom. Thanks. - Here's what you can do for me. - Sure. - We got a new group of trainees coming in here next week. We need an experienced jumper to help with the training. - No problem. - Great. Should I have drinks on the veranda? (dramatic upbeat music) - What are you doing? Are you walking up there? You want me call your mum and have her come down here with some hot soup for you? You look like a bunch of rejects from the girl scouts. You know, on the real deal, you got a ton of gear on your back. This is the easy part. A wise old guy wants told me, "Fire can blow up so quick, it can even catch God by surprise." And its best is going uphill. - I don't believe we're ever gonna get rid of him. - Nope, he's one of us. The few, the proud, the diluted. - Hey, how was the movie? - Hey, it was awesome. - Daddy ate two boxes of popcorn corn all by himself. - Yeah. Hey, it's Bob man. - Yeah. - Now I need that. - Hey sweetie. - Oh, you are getting to be such a big sack of potatoes. - Will you stay here tonight? - Not tonight, sweetie. - Why not? - It's better if I stay over at Tom's. Give me a kiss. Go help your little sister. You should have come. It was actually pretty good. It's about these five little Saint Bernard puppies which had this Mohawk haircut. - Catch it on video. - No. Got the support check. - Thanks. - Maybe sometime we could all go out to eat together. - All right. - Yeah. (soft piano music) (car engine revving) - Don. - Yo, what's up? - I got a couple pieces of news. Number one, I'm leaving. They want me to head up the McCall Base. - Riding a desk? - It won't be totally administrative. I told them I wouldn't do it if I couldn't go out to an occasional fire. (plane engine roars) - When? - Two months. And don't worry, I'm not selling the house. You can use it as long as you like until you get things sorted out. - Thanks. Congratulations. This wouldn't have anything to do with Glenna, would it? - Yeah, well, she's starting to get kind of serious, you know? There's no telling what I can get myself talked into if I don't watch out. - I know what you mean. - I got another piece of news. You got an appointment. - I've got an appointment - Long time coming huh? - Perfect timing. - Better than no timing at all. (plane engine roaring) - Hey Rene, I walked by a florist on my way to the motel tonight. - [Rene Over Telephone] Yeah. - Yellow roses aren't special. Yeah, I was just thinking about the day Leslie Ann was born. That's gotta be the most fantastic day of my life. - Yeah, that was pretty great. You know what another one was? - What? - That time I came off the fire line and you were standing there waiting for me. - Yeah, that was pretty fun, wasn't it? - Oh, it was definitely fun. So where are you headed next? - They're diverting us to Colorado, over by Glenwood spring. It's pretty dry there. Lost about a hundred acres so far. - Be careful Don. - You bet. Hey Rene. - Yo. - I'd do it all over again. - Well, maybe we should do it all over again. - I could stand it if you could. - Why don't you call me when you get back from your fire. Okay? I love you, Don. - I love you too. - Bye. (plane engine roaring) - We think lightning caused it about three days ago. As of this morning, we have 31 uncontrolled fires in the area, but this is the one we want to be. - Who do we got down there so far? - We have a BLM crew and a Forest Service crew. They clearly held a spot down there and cut out a scratch line along the ridge. The IC's name is Terry Bass. You'll coordinate with him. You're the jumper in charge. Ready to jump? - Let's do it. - All right. (upbeat music) - Don, Terry Bass. - Hey. - I'm the IC. - Don Mackey, how're you doing? - Glad to have reinforcements. - Yeah. - We've got an order of hotshots coming in from Prineville, Oregon. Should be here just about noon. - Yeah, from the looks of it, you might wanna call in some more jumpers too. I sure like to keep the fire out of those drainages down there. This oak's pretty dry. - It's what I'm thinking. - All right. I'll get my people to work on the handline. - Meanwhile, why don't you send me down some of those hotshots when they arrive. - [Terry] One order of hotshots coming up. - Thanks, Terry. (fire cracking) (helicopter rotors whirring) - [Woman] I think we need a 4 inch saw. - [Mackey] Well, well, well, look who's here. Jumpers coming in from McCall. - [Man] About time. - Yeah. Let's break for lunch. - [Man] Hey, check it out. - Hey, rookie! Whoa! - Hey. Look who they lit out from behind his desk. - How're you doing old timer? - Good. - Remember Jim Thrash, Roger Roth. - Yeah, yeah. - How's your line holding? - Okay so far. Picked up on some spot fires though. Weather's squirreling. We got a cold front moving in. No telling what it'll do. You gotta run through that pinion Juniper over there. You're gonna have to bump up quick. - Good to see you, Tom. - You too, rookie. Where do you want me? - Why don't you take some guys and scout over the east. See if you can dig a scratch line. We'll work our way up, probably over. - Done. - Yo. You six guys, you come with me. The rest of you stay with Don. - [Woman] All right you guys. - You're right, squirrely as hell. - Yeah, but it's better than no fire at all. All right, let's go Fire starting to spot on the other side of the ridge line. We're gonna need some bucket traps up here pretty quick. - [Tom Over Radio] Is it getting away from you or you're okay? - It's holding, but there's no telling what's gonna happen when that front comes through. Jimmy, Roger, why don't you go down to the fire line and help out the hotshots. - Right. - Got it. Get in there, let's go. - Classen, you copy? - [Tom Over Radio] Copy. - Yeah, how's it look over there buddy? - Not good. We need more help over here. - All right, I'm gonna go up to the heli spot, talk to the IC. (helicopter rotors whirring) - How's this look? - Not great. If we don't get some rechrging in here pretty quick, we gonna lose this fire. - I'm worried about my people. I'm gonna go down and check on them. Keep me posted. - [Man] Get out, move! Up the hill. Let's go, move! IC, this is the line scout, she's making the run through here. We gotta get out. It's too unstable. - How many do we still got down there, Tom? - This is gonna hit us, I got (indistinct), go! Don, Don! - Still got people down there. Get out your shelters out at the ridge line, go! (fire cracking) Get the hell out of here, there's more coming. You gotta get out of here. Go, move, move! - [Man] There's two more (indistinct). I can't get to 'em. - No! - [Tom] "We wanted you to know that Don died while trying to get his people out of there. When he was found, he had his hands over his head in the classic defensive posture they teach you in training. But nobody could have survived that fire. Well, you know what they say about smoke jumpers? There's no you sending them to hell when they die. They'll just put it out. All our love to you and the kids. From the smoke jumpers of Missoula, Montana." - [Narrator] On July 6th, 1994, 14 firefighters lost their lives at Storm King Mountain. Three were smoke jumpers, two were helitack firefighters, and nine were hotshots from Pineville, Oregon. It was one of the worst losses of personnel in the history of fighting forest fires. Kathi Beck, Tami Beckett, Scott Blecha, Levi Brinkley, Robert Browning, Doug Dunbar, Terri Hagen, Bonnie Holtby, Rob Johnson, John Kelso, Don Mackey, Roger Roth, James Thrash and Richard Tyler were killed in the line of duty.
