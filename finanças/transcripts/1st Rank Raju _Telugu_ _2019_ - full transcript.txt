Hey Shyam... -Sir. come here, keep it there Sir namaste. -Namaste. If you want to get a job in our Khushi company you need to have really high standards. So prepare a nice list Of candidates. Okay sure. Dear lord Ganesha getting a job in this company is as good as winning the jackpot. Please bless me to get a job in this company. If you do that I’ll share your picture on Instagram Facebook and Twitter.... and make sure you get thousand likes. Please Ganesh... please Ganesh... please Ganesh. Hey man stop.. why are you not following the queue and coming from the side of the line? Sir one small information. – What is it? How many job positions are there inside? what do you mean how many positions there is only one job requirement. Only one post? Only one post? Isn’t it? Let’s go Hey guys what is this? why isn’t anyone attending the interview and where are you guys going? Sir there is already a guy who is the most reserved and deserved for this job position. What’s the point of all of us being here? Candidate? Who is that? Raju. Raju? He’s not just Raju sir, he is first rank Raju You are First Rank Raju right? Yes sir how did you know? Even when you have come to face an interview... you are still reading how to face an interview book. I find that fascinating. Ha ha thank you sir Your first in the school, first in the college as well as the University. So when did you decide that you wanted to come first in everything? that time my age is to be 0.0027 years (murmuring) Chitra Star, and Pieces Birth Sign. Date of birth is 8, total number is 8. Stop you’re dumb signs and tell me what the matter is? A person born on this date with these astrological signs cannot be good in studies ever. As per the numerological sciences... a person who has a total number of 8 can never become good at studies. Your child cannot step into college This is the fate. No... Though generations have changed won’t our fate change? In my Entire family there are only average or failure students... won’t we ever have a rank student? That is the fate and no one can ever change that. Well, I will change it even if the three worlds collide and the heavens come falling down to us, I will make my son a First Rank student and make the whole Karampudi family proud! Or else my name is not Karampudi Shoban Babu! According to the star sign of this child you can name him as YADAVA (Fool)! Yadava? what kind of name is this? No, I did not mean to name your child as Yadava(fool) I meant the first letters of his name should start with YA or DA or VA ! Priest, please tell us if there is any other letter. Okay you can use RA A name with only one letter? Everyone will tell him: come RA, Go RA, what RA? Wait once, priest name him Raju. It’s good No it’s not,Don’t need him just Raju I want him to be named as First Rank Raju What kind of name is that? Usually children make a big name and they make their parents proud, But I want my son to live up to his own name. The future of a person won’t be based upon the name of the child it will be based on their behaviour. Okay. Raju... I pray upon the Lord to grant your child with very good education and sense. No ,no need of sense good education is enough. Please bless him that he will get hundred percent marks every time. Bless him bless him. May you get Rank every time. Okay kid, now you write, (So that’s how the priest decided my name and my dad decided my fate) ( Song Humming) Daddy... – what’s the matter my boy? Matter is any substance, which has mass and occupies physical space. Good you are on the right track. Dad why are you placing the flowers in the water? kid, is this in your syllabus? – No Dad stop learning things which are not in your syllabus... and don’t mess up your brain with unnecessary information. Book knowledge is more important than general knowledge. Kid what did they teach you in today’s class? Today? Raju, what do you want to become when you grow up? I said that I wanted to become president like Abdul Kalam. No that’s not right kid. You have to say that you’ll become an engineer. But isn’t becoming president, greater than becoming an engineer? Hey kid, concentrate more on answers and stop asking so many questions, only then you can get first rank. But knowledge is always more important than general knowledge. Chicken is five rupees and an egg is three rupees. How much would it cost to buy three chickens and 2 eggs? Dad, if an egg costs three rupees how can a chicken cost just five rupees? Hey kid how many times do I have to tell you stop asking so many questions, whatever is in the book just blindly follow it. I am repeating myself one more time book knowledge is more important than... general knowledge. That was the last time, I never asked questions and my dad never gave me answers... from then on I started studying only to get First Rank. Raju K .... first rank! YEAH!! Every time I used to get first rank my dad used to distribute sweets to everyone. My dad’s wish was for me to study very well and get a job in this really prestigious company But suddenly one day... 2nd Rank... My dad, always used to distribute sweets whenever I get the first rank, however, this time initially scolded me and then called the doctor. Cool... Cool... Mani... Manormani! Namaste Doctor I can read the brain without even scanning it, I can observe it and not just that, I can even write notes on it. So who has the problem? For you or for you? Not for us, it’s for our kid.. He fell... He fell? You mean fall down? From where? From the terrace? From the tree? Or from a motorcycle? No doctor,He fell from 1st rank to 2nd rank. Cool cool... so in which course? EAMCET OR ICET? No no, in Third standard Oho in the third standard? Cool. Where is the boy? Hi... – Hi uncle. what is the matter my boy? Matter is any substance which has mass and occupies physical space. Cool... cool... what are your daily activities like? I wake up every day at 5 o’clock in the morning okay after that? I drink boost and do exercise physical exercise? No uncle... maths exercises. Maths exercises? Okay after that? I take a bath. My dad stands outside the door and asks me questions and answers regarding my subjects. Cool... Cool... What do you do after that? I go to eat breakfast and at that time my mom helps me with my revision of my syllabus. Oh wow wow, very good family. What about going to the playground and playing some physical games like kabaddi and cricket. Games in the ground? If you go and play games like this on the ground and you keep hurting yourself... how will you go to school and how will you get first rank? Why are you crying about this? It’s just a small hurt, it will heal in no time! I’m not crying about the hurt I’m crying because my kid is going to miss out on his classes. if he doesn’t go to school, the school itself will come here. (Water air and temperature other three...) If you really want to play any games play games like yoga and meditation which are indoor activities Yoga.... meditation... these are indoor games? Curse this guy... What shows do you watch on the TV? Dad, why are these two fighting? They are fighting for the prize which is a belt. But these two are not even wearing pants why do they even need a belt? Hey... our kid is watching TV and getting to much general knowledge. From today the TV is not going to work anymore. What’s your dads name? – Shobhan Babu is your moms name Vanisri? Their pair looks very nice. Okay now I’m going to use my brain and get out the sportiveness which is hiding inside him. Raju look at this what comes to your mind after seeing this? Yeah I got it uncle – what is it? This is the circle... this is the radius... this is the circumference... This is the diameter, area of circle is equal to Pi R Square, circumference is equal to 2Pi R.. Mr Mani, how did you become like this? What did I become sir? Is this the way you bring up your child? So what is the problem with my child? -What can I say about the problem? Your kid is like a text book wearing a T-shirt and a notebook which is wearing shorts. What ever I ask its just questions and answers. cool Mr Mani cool. -What do you mean by cool man? If I stay here any longer, I have to go to some psychiatrist. Sorry, Manormani cool cool. I got someone else to cure our Raju. Who..? Your kid is possessed by two devils Two devils? Oh maybe that’s why he got second rank ? First send out the second devil from him, then only one will be left, and automatically he’ll get first rank. Done Oh Ho Ho Ho Ho, Heey Chandramukhi, Bhagamati, Arundhati, Nagavalli... From then on, any time I wouldn’t study I was scared that this black magician would come into our house again. I became first rank Raju Raju... Raju... First rank Raju. (English Rap...) King of Ranks with no Common sense. King sized man, confused about the world. Just born to write exams, meeting a fool like him is our bad luck. No matter how many marks he scores, he is a Zero in the real world. He says maths problems are easy, but runs away from real life problems. Will your thinking ever change? Or is it like a dog’s tail? Raju... Raju... First rank Raju. He is...He is.. the No.1 Fool. Raju... Raju... First rank Raju. He is...He is.. the No.1 Fool. What are you doing..? -It is not cleaning. Now check it once. Lemons..Lemons... How much for Lemons? 1 For 5 or 3 For 10. If 1 is 5 rupees, in that case is it not 3 For 15 rupees? Do you think I don’t know Mathematics? I scored 100/100 in Mathematics. Take 15 and give me 3. This guy is a superb person and college topper also. He is the joker for all the students in the campus. He has not even seen a cinema ticket up till now. He knows only the exam hall ticket. He has never seen the facebook in his life If anyone will pee here then the police will take away. Is it...! okay. let them take away. It is waste, right? At least they can use it. If we heat this with 100-degree Celsius and distil we can extract Salt. Oh god! Will he stop...? His nonsense from here onwards. Or else will he continue it Like a never bendable dog’s tail. Raju... Raju... First rank Raju. He is...He is.. the No.1 Fool. Raju... Raju... First rank Raju. He is...He is.. the No.1 Fool. Hey specs guy.. any liquor shop is available here? I know where it is. Come along with me..I will show you that place. This is that one I am asking for liquor shop not for medical shop..Idiot.. 3 years have passed in my Engineering college. Don’t trouble the trouble, if you trouble the trouble, trouble will trouble you, bro, where is Nandu? – I don’t know man, why did you stop? continue.. Hey man, come here which branch are you in? – Mechanical engineering sir. if you are a mechanic then why did you come to college, you should be going to the garage. Bro, we are also in mechanical only.. -Oh is it? Why didn’t you tell me you didn’t ask me bro, ok send him.. yeah go. - Okay Sir. Hey yellow shirt, come here. hey stop, look here, which branch are you in? Computer science. what do you plan to do by studying computer science? I always wanted to be a doctor from my childhood if you study computer science, will you become a doctor? Why not? There will be science in computer science right? Hey Bro, Will it really be there? It will be there, it will be there, why won’t it be there.. maybe it will be there, just like BCom in physics. what’s your name man? – Khalil Khan so you become a doctor by studying computer science right? Yeah I’m going to become a doctor, in two months I will become a doctor! Oh okay go study computer science and become a doctor. Khudafhis (thank you) -MRO Office Good Morning sir. In my college, I was my Principal’s favourite student. He treats me as a favorite student, and I used to follow him blindly. First Rank Raju, tomorrow evening there is the freshers day program, so I have selected a nice celebrity for the event. Oh! Who is it sir? Classical Dancer Kanya Kumari, This is her phone number, once call her and find out if she is free tomorrow. Sir, but if we have a function, won’t we be missing the classes? No problem, we can keep the program only after your classes. Okay sir, -Okay ? if it’s after 7 PM no problem. Hello, is this classical dancer Kanya Kumari? Yes, tell me. Madam if you’re free tomorrow after 7 PM I would like to book you. What? If you could tell us how much you would charge, we will arrange... Hey you idiot, what the hell are you talking? Oh no don’t take me wrong madam. It’s not for me, it’s for my principal sir. He wants only you. -Oh no... give me the phone. Who the hell is your principal? What the hell are you talking man? -Madam Excuse me... What do you think of me? What is he talking about? If you call me one more time ,you will lose my respect. Disconnect the call. What is this Raju, I asked you to book the Madam, but you have booked me and got me into trouble. But Sir you only have asked me to book her right? Raja, you shouldn't book people like how you would book a cab. They will misunderstand. oh then in that situation, what should we do sir? Any time if you get confused with words, or if you can't remember the words... Just like how I do... you should manage your speech by saying something like THIS or THAT. What are you writing my boy? I’m noting down whatever you are saying sir. Very good my dear boy, you have something in you which nobody else has. Thank you sir dear students, good evening. Welcome to all. Today classical dancer Kanya Kumari has come to do 'That'... “THAT” means to entertain all of us. My best wishes to her. Just like how Charminar is for Hyderabad, Taj Mahal is for Agra, First Rank Raju is like that for our college. Since three years Raju is securing first rank consecutively. Thank you. and made sure our college got a very big “THAT”, “THAT” means a very good name. Now Raju is going to deliver a motivational speech. Good evening friends, every time our principal praises me, but I have never got an opportunity to praise him. But today I got a chance to express myself about him. Just like how Edison invented the bulb, and how Graham Bell invented the phone, Our principal sir invented me. Sir, are you a scientist? No black Raja, he meant that I have discovered him Oh ha ha -Yeah. Sir, how come he is praising you so much? -Check out his upcoming speech. The reason why I am on stage today and recieving this award is because of what I have in me... Which is... Which is... Any time you’re confused about what to say, just like me you have to manage your words by saying “ THAT” or “ THIS” “THAT” I didn’t know that I had “THAT” in me. But the person who has discovered “THAT” in me is our principal Sir What do you mean by “THAT”? He didn’t just discover... “THAT” in me but also made sure that he took “THAT” in me and made it grow bigger. Sir what is “THAT”? What? – “THAT” Our principal Sir always used to tell me you have something in you which nobody else has. But I don’t believe him, I know everyone has “THAT” in them. It will be there...it will be there..., why won’t it be there? what is “THAT”? – “THAT” But “THAT” will be hidden inside us, but you shouldn’t just hide it there, you should take it out and show it to the whole world, especially to our principal Sir. Oh no...! If you can do that, he will not just praise you... and he will recognise your merit and he will encourage you with an award like this. I swear on my mom, I have no relation to what ever he saying If in case “THAT” is not there in you, don’t worry, Just be-friend someone who has “THAT” and make sure yours grows bigger along with his. Just making it bigger won’t help you... but you have to know the right time and the right place to use it properly. Only then the world will know about us. Isn’t that right principal sir? This idiot doesn’t know the difference between single meaning and double meaning. If I let it be, he is going to continue like this... Go... go. Now I’m going to tell you how to make yours really big.. -Hey man, Raju Raju, it doesn’t look like you’re expressing yourself , it looks like you’re exposing me. Please don’t misunderstand Raju. “That” means art, “THAT” means skill, “THAT” means Knowledge. All these are there inside everyone. you must bring them out and develop your skills and show the whole world who you really are. That is what Raju meant to say, isn’t that right Raju? Yes, my “THAT” has come out of our Sir’s mouth. Oh gosh, this is just my ill fate. In my house, in the college, in the university, I have a clean “U” certificate. First time in my life, because of you, you made me a pure “A” Certificate. Sir I have an A+ grade in my Certificate. Please clap for this extraordinary genius and send him off the stage. Good morning Sir. Good morning Subbarao, what brings you here? I need to leave sir Leave..? Why? Tomorrow is my housewarming ceremony sir. You have to definitely come and attend it. Why are you giving me a visiting card for your housewarming? No sir, that is an invitation card. bigger the card size the more the cost,sir. That’s why... Hey don’t give anyone Tea or Coffee, They must’ve already drank at home and come. -Oh no nothing like that.. Hello Sir, you have come? – Yeah man, I have come Only you have come I guess? -no no even my wife has come... my cook... my servant... my gardener... my driver... and their children, we all have come.. Oh, everyone has come? Hey, this is the time for auspicious... get the cow in. This is a cow? Normally, everyone gets a big cow to the housewarming ceremony, but how come you have got a small little calf, which is your size? The cow is high budget. A calf fits my low budget. Oh, you have a lot in you Subbarao. - your blessings Sir. (Cursing while murmuring) this is my wife, Soundarya Namaste... –Namaste. Didn’t your son Raju come? – He is in some... My son doesn’t attend functions like these, He is studying at home... That’s why he’s called First Rank Raju, 99% in all his subjects What about the other one percent? That one percent belongs to him, my son, A big idiot Dad not idiot, Venky He looks like a monkey Hi uncle, give me a minute I’ll be back, bye Bye. Come inside I’ll show you my home looks good man, you build a nice house. – this is the hall, this is the kitchen, this is some sweet for you, please have it. Where is the sweet in this? It’s there, check it out carefully sir. these look like homeopathy medicine balls – Exactly sir He everyone have this... or else there may not be meals later. So have these while you can . Come on, quick... quick. today is Kartik Poornima festival, so most people will be fasting today. That’s why I planned the function today! There’s lot of matter in you, Subba Rao. -It’s all your grace Sir. Come sir, check out my son’s room. - Please come. Oh wow, there are even books in your son’s room! My son may get less marks... but he studies a lot of books. Looks like your son has a lot of habits other than studies! He is in his youthful days right, so maybe that’s why. Oh new house, new laptop. I bought it in second hand in Sultan Bazaar for his project work. Oh which project is you doing? Show me. Stop it, stop it right now. Hi Paddu darling... I’m bored working on project all alone a home... shall we go outside and get busy with practicals? Please, sweetheart... -Hey, hey man, come down immediately! Hey my dad is calling me, I’ll just call you right back Hey dad, what happened? Any problem? I’m really busy up here. What happened why are you carrying that stick? Are you cleaning the house? -Yeah man, first I will clean you up! What are the cigarette packets? What are the CDs? What are those books? Oh my god oh my god! what is that project work man? I will bloody kill you ,you idiot! Subbarao Subbarao, stop it, come here. -Go and stop him! Come here... sit -Bloody donkey! Anyways, the mistake is not his, it’s yours. I never saw anything like that, Sir Hello, I’m not talking about that. Look at his dressing... hair like a chimpanzee, that ear piercing, those torn jeans, body full of tattoos... beard like a gorilla, he looks like an example of a fool. Look at my son instead.. his lifestyle, his hairstyle, his dressing style, gentlemen, he is a gentleman! You must bring him up like that. At least now, change the way how you bring him up. though he may not become a software engineer, he will at least become a clerk, like you! Or else he will be fit for nothing! Excuse me... can you tell me the way to Vishveshwarya college? Oh, Vishveshwarya college? I know very well! Go straight, you will get 360° circle, -ok. take The circumference, you will get a diagonal Road, biscect that, and then you’ll get... Hello hello, hold on! I asked you the address in Telugu, why are you answering me in mathematics? Ha ha, thank you so much! Thanks? Hello... Vishweshwarya college... are you also from Vishweshwarya college? yeah I’m from the same college! When you are also from the same college, why don’t you sit on my bike and show me the address? But you only asked me for the address, right? You didn’t ask me to sit on your bike,right? Anyways, I’m getting really late for my class. I have the principles period today. So I can’t miss it Oh! Nice campus. Hey Mr. Peon My name is not peon, it’s sunny! Oh just like Sunny Leone, you are sunny peon! That’s a funny joke right? Yeah, the joke is really nice! Thank you. Anyways, is this a good college? Will we get a good placement here? You will definitely get a good placement here. Even I am from the same college and I got placed here right? Yeah. What is that madam? Why are you white washing your face? Come let’s go for dinner. I’m managing myself really well, that is why my boyfriend is still with me. Sorry, I’m going out for dinner with him. Look at her! She is studying so seriously! Who? Her? You only look! Mahesh? Mahesh is my boyfriend! She has been chatting from the morning. – how long will you be chatting? Will you find dinner in whatsApp? I may not get dinner but I will be getting a guy who will treat me to a dinner! so looks like everyone is busy. Bye Padhu so, you don’t have any boyfriend? What’s new in that? If you are good looking they will hit on you, all it takes a small little smile and they will come and propose to you. If you agree to them they will become a Lover boy or else they will become DevDas. But I have a lot of dreams about the kind of boyfriend that I want! Oh what are those? He should be really smart looking, just like Mahesh Babu in Pokiri movie. Oh wow! He should be really stylish, just like Allu Arjun in Arya movie. He should never lie, he should never hit on other girls. He shouldn’t follow me, only I should follow him. I should take him around everywhere. He shouldn’t propose to me... only I should propose to him. Well, all that sounds really silly! Looks like all those are just really dreams! Don’t fire the fire, if you fire , the fire will fire you – Hey man, look there. In our college 90% of the girls look really pretty. – what about the other 10%? They’re all in our class That is really true, man... There is not even one good looking girls in our class. Where is the fire, where is the fire man. - Hi... - Hi. I want you to tell it with fire. -Hi Darling... Hey, come here! - Hi are you fine? I’ll smash you! What is this man, why did she just hit you and walk away? All this is because of that First Rank Raju guy - First Rank Raju? Isn’t he just like a chocolate boy? I am mad about you, I’m madly going behind you. Because I am madly in love with you. If you say okay I’m gonna rock your world. But if you say no... I’m going to become a mad person. I hope she doesn’t think that I am mad... But sounding of this is really brilliant. If anyone could translate this in English it would be awesome! Hey, First Rank Raju... He Raju, check out that girl. She is my figure! Figure? Do you mean a diagram? Figure means....Means... Even if I tell you you won’t understand man. I’m really trying to impress that girl, but it’s now working out. I have written on this paper, what ever I feel for her. But I feel it will be better if it’s in English. Can you please translate this for me in English? -Oh that’s it. Okay. I am mad about you... so you are mad You are mad.... What!? Yes, you are mad. Sorry, I’m not getting you Shall I say it out louder? You are mad!! I am mad madly rounding your back. Because, I am mad madly wants to make love to you.. If you say yes, I will increase your madness. But if you say no, I’ll go mad. That’s why, you are mad. She thought I was mad, and she hit me really badly and left! what happened after that bro? Since the English version was not working out, I went to narrate her, my Telugu version! I am madly in love with you Hey, why is everyone spreading rumours about you in the college? He’s going to come right now, then I will deal with him! Hi Sanjana, I’ve written it in Telugu – come here dear Thanks. oh my gosh, I guess she doesn’t even know Telugu! Just because I didn’t accept your love, you and that Raju are spreading rumours about me? I’ll smash you idiot! Raju.... Hey first rank, what are you telling about us in the college? About whom? About me and my girl friend. Oh! About that, I just told everyone that you guys were sleeping together. sleeping together? Where? Without me knowing? When? Yesterday, when the chemistry classes were going on, everyone was listening to the class but both of you were sleeping. I just told that to everyone... that’s it! I slept because I was bored of the lecture. And you were spreading to everyone as if we both were sharing a bedroom! You idiot, dumbass, nerd! From then on, any where she sees me... she just hitting me and going, as if I was a bell in the temple! That’s stupid nerd, we shouldn’t leave him we should teach him a lesson! Hey, call back Raju fellow Raju, yeah... Hey, Raju He won’t respond if you call him like that. Hey, First Rank Raju! What is it? I’m getting late, anything urgent? You dumb ass nerd Hey, you are Raju right? where are you going so urgently? I should not miss the principal’s period. If you miss even one period your whole future could get spoilt! Yeah that’s true! Can you do a small help for me? Yeah okay. You see the girls there right? They’re just wasting their time. Will you tell the same thing that you told us, to them? Oh? That girl, I know her very well. I am the one who told her the address of our college. I’ll tell her this also. I will tell, I will definitely tell. What happened to today’s girls? They are not even serious about the Principal’s period! Hi Sruthi! Sruthi, I heard you’re missing your periods. What..!? College means it’s all fun and games, I know that. But it is very risky, you know. Even if you miss one period, your whole future may get spoilt. Idiot. (Guys Laughing) Are you happy? Who are those guys? It’s them! Who is that? Bro, it’s just a small issue! You just keep talking on the phone, let us deal with this. Yeah bro, I’m coming. Hey Uncle, did you come here for the parents and teachers meeting? I didn’t come here for a meeting, I came here to fight! The joke is really nice. We can keep it in the movie! Wow...! As soon as I said cinema, he pulled out bike silencer, Just because I’m wearing an In-Shirt, did you think that I was innocent? My son maybe a software guy... but I am a hardware guy! Just because you pulled out the silencer... does that mean.. we should be scared of you? Just have a look at how big our gang is! You should have a look first, dude. You’ll be shocked looking at our gang! What? There is no one behind us. I guess they got scared and went to the background! Just tell him something and manage the situation. Anyways, this guy is from the 70s. The fight like ohh ahh ooo , haha Bro, I think he is an 80s guy.. -Oh, you mean this? Outdated batch... I’m ready uncle, not just this... I even know karate!! And kung fu also, do you want to see? I don’t know any of those, but I really know how to BASH someone up... Come on dad, hit them really badly , come on ,come on... Come on dad, hit them, Yes yes.... Come on dad... hit them, Yes yes.... Hey man, if you ever mess around with my kid again... I’m going to break all your silencers! -please spare us, uncle... Get lost! -please spare us. Idiot, loafer.... Do you know how embarrassed I was? Hey, don’t take it so seriously. He may know the spelling of the word that he said but he doesn’t even know the meaning. Nandu’s batch is to be blamed in this incident. Without knowing this, you slapped him and embarrassed him in front of everyone. Anyways, he is really innocent. But who can be so innocent? I don’t believe it. Listen to me. Go and apologise to him tomorrow it self. Seriously? Just go and do it. You will only understand. Okay Hello, excuse me. Hi... -Hello... When I came to talk to you, why are you going away? I have the principal’s period today, even if we miss one period our whole future will get spoilt. Actually... actually I misunderstood you, I’m really sorry It’s okay. so does this mean that you have excuse me? Yeah. Thank god. By the way, I’m Shruti... Friends? -No thanks No thanks? Do you know how many people are waiting to befriend me? Did you know that the principal is waiting for me? Did you get shocked ? did you get shocked? what is this? When a girl as pretty as me is asking him to be friends, he’s just walking away. That’s why he is known as the first ranker. Not only will he ever give a look to women, he will never even give a book, either. How did you think a guy like him would ever be a friend to you? Don’t take it seriously. So he never befriends any women. This guy has a new character, that I have never seen. I should study him. Here you go dear, some Boost. – Thank you Mom. can you do a small favour for me? Your dad is going to be late, and even I’m not feeling too well. So can you go to the market and get whatever is there in this list? Market? Where will that be mom? Raju... Where is he going? Yeah Tomatoes... How much For these tomatoes? – Rs.20 each one is Rs. 20? This guy looks like a scapegoat Not for just one, one KG is Rs.20 Don’t keep them how much ever they ask, bargain. Rs.20 is way too much, I’ll give you 19 Rs... If you’re okay with that let me know, or else I’ll just go to the next shop. Oh okay okay, you can have it my dear boy. You look like a nice person. Yeah it’s okay. Hey boy, why are you taking the unripe ones? You can take the ripe tomatoes. You won’t charge extra for the ripe ones right? No no no... already here give me a lot of extra money, Scapegoat! Here you go, Rs.380 . Ok bye. hey boy, are you a first ranker? Yes uncle, how did you find out? By observing the few faces we can make out. You are my god! Give me four coconuts. Here are some nice unripe coconuts, you can have them. -No no I want some ripe coconuts. Ripe coconuts? what do you mean by ripe ones? you also don’t know? Okay these are fine. If you wait for one day I guess this will only become ripe. Hey boy, come here once Are you are first ranker? Yeah, How did you also find out? I found out by the fact that you placed coconuts above the tomatoes! My mom wrote it in this order only, this is only correct. I guess this is what they mean by when they say if you study too much, you will loose all your common sense. Next, give me a KG of big peppers. A KG of big papers won’t fit in that bag. Okay then, give me a KG of small peppers. Oh my gosh, you are.... – Yes I’m a first ranker. Already I became famous here, did you know that? What Geetha had said is very true! You are here. So you don’t befriend any woman? I’m gonna make sure you fall for me, with all this glamour. Sin C plus Cos C is equal Raju, I want to ask you something. Will you tell me? Oh! You can ask any question in any subject, I will answer you! No no, it’s not about the subject, it’s about an object... Object? Sin C plus Cos C By the way, how am I looking? equals to Sec C (Sexy) Really? Yes, 1/Cos C equals to Sec C (Sexy) you don’t know that also? This is just simple trigonometry. Oh no, that’s not what I meant. Raju, look at me and tell me! You look really normal to me. Hey Raju, check me out clearly and let me know... oh! Our new college ID card. I have designed this! Oh no! He is observing everything he shouldn’t see, and he’s just ignoring the things that he should be seeing! What a tube light! Raju, can I have your number? 040 2738234 -Is this a landline number? Don’t you have a mobile phone? Mobile phone? I don't need that. this is my number! Oh gosh no! You wrote it on this itself? I’ve been writing this assignment from morning. Now I have to write it all over again, shit! Did he tear it? Now please did you understand, that he is not 4G he is just a Parle G kid. Yes, I understood that. This is not enough for him, I have to try harder! Hi! Hi, are you calling me? Oh gosh, who is this guy? How do I tell him now? Date Date? With me? Oh yes, yes yes yes. Why did you write the date man? What? today? Oh my God Not that date, the other one! – Oh yeah! I got it. Okay Date does not mean this! Oh you weren’t talking to me? Shruti, get out. You really don’t know the meaning of a date? That is the meaning of a date, you have never eaten one? Oh gosh, that’s not what I meant by date. A girl and a guy going out to coffee shops, long drives, movies... It’s a lot of fun, you know! No no, all those are really bad habits. If you do all those our percentage will decrease. oh no! How do I explain to this nerd! Raju, how much is your percentage now? – 95% It looks like you’re always studying, so shouldn’t you be getting 100%. Why are you just getting 95% You’re right – where is the other 5%? Where did that 5% go? Well, that’s because you missed on something – something? Something... something... So what should I do to get a 100% ? You should listen to what I tell you to do if I do whatever you tell me, will I really get 100% ? Yes, I am a hundred percent sure! In that case, okay. So what should we do now? Hi Sruthi! – Hi I’m sorry I got a little late... – nice shirt. Thank you, my dad bought it for me. But what about you? Why did you forget to wear your pants? But that’s okay, shall we start? What are these? – Books. There is no need of all those. You can keep them inside. Oh so you’ll be starting with practicals first, is it? Yeah, something like that. sir, order. – one Boost (drink) Boost (drink)? I thought he was a lover boy, but he seems like a school boy. That won’t be available here. Two cappuccinos please. – okay madam Raju, is this the first time that you’ve come to coffee Day? Yeah this is my first time. But why isn’t anyone studying here? Everyone only does combined studies here Raju, what is your opinion about Love? Oh! Love? I know that very well. I love my mother, I love my father... I love my country, all Indians are my brothers and sis... If I let it be like this, it looks like he is going to make me a sister also! Raju, I’m not talking about parents love or prayer love. You know the love that happens between a boy and a girl, I’m talking about that... Oh! Does that also ever happen? My dad never told me about this Parents won’t tell you everything.. – Then? A few things must be told by friends only. Oh I’m so lucky... I am so lucky that I got a friend like you. Let’s talk about something else, besides these studies. Do you watch movies? No. I love movies! I watch all movies including Telugu, Hindi, English and I don’t even leave the dubbed movies Oh my god! This is Akshay Kumar’s picture. you look kind of like Akshay Kumar from an angle Oh thank you! This is also Akshay Kumar’s picture. Thank you Oh welcome! That is also Akshay Kumar’s picture that’s superb that is Nagarjuna‘s picture is it? That is Ravi Babu‘s picture. Hey Pokiri No no, I’m a gentleman This is Nani‘s picture Nani? – This is Mahesh’s picture power star! Who is power star? What happened to all these people? I’m sorry guys, he won’t watch movies. there’s absolutely no one on this planet, who doesn’t know about power Star. Oh is he really that great? You really have never seen any pictures till now? – No Come with me, I’ll take you to movie right now! Wonder woman. 2 corner seats Hey, why are we taking the corner seats? Let’s take the front seats! We can watch the movie in a better way Hey man, is this your first time? Yes, this is my first time! I heard they even switch off the lights inside! Ticket please... hey, why are you giving it to him? Oh gosh! Why did you tear them, man? Shruti, we have to buy them again now. I don’t want to go get them again! Sir, is this your first time? Yes, this is my first time. I heard they even switch off the lights inside! Looks like the tube light is slowly switching on! Eww, take your hands off me. Why are you sitting so far away? Unnecessarily you are keeping your hand or your leg on me. Isn’t one seat enough for you? That’s why I came here to set What an ill fate!! With such a dude! For what is this love? Oh god! What has happened to you girl? Can't be expressed in words... Engulfed in some strange magic... Meanwhile.. my heart has Fallen in love with him. My heart told me and I just recognised... within me- is love! Other than pumping blood, heart doesn't do a thing! What's up with me this minute... that I've fallen for you... Better don't fall and get bruised all over! What an ill fate!! With such a dude! For what is this love? Without you, the time doesn't seem to move ahead, It would have- had you changed the batteries of your wrist watch..! You aren't social with anyone- are you? What to do? After all my subject is science. What an ill fate!! With such a dude! For what is this love? Oh god! What has happened to you girl? Can't be expressed in words... Engulfed in some strange magic... Meanwhile.. my heart has Fallen in love with him. Raju? You said your boyfriend should be looking like Allu Arjun or Mahesh Babu. How did you end up loving that nerd? He may not be looking like a hero, but I am in love with his innocence! Hey, have you seen Raju? -No. I was searching for you everywhere in our college. I need to tell you something. Even I need to tell you something. No, I want to tell you something first. Actually, today is a very special day in my life. I have never proposed to anyone before this. But during this one month, I was really happy to be around you. I think... I think I’m in love with you. Are you done? Now can I tell you something? You also wanted to tell me the same thing, right? No. Then? What did you tell me? If I did everything that you said, I would be getting 100% right? But I still got only 95% Oh no. I lied to you, just to spend time with you. Don’t take it seriously. No! This is cheating! I... I am sorry Raju, I just told you that to get close to you. Because... because... I love you. What do you mean by Love? Raju, please don’t joke about this. I’m very serious. Why are you getting seriously angry? I am the one who supposed to get seriously angry! I listened to you, and came where ever you want it. Ice cream shops, coffee shops, movies I came everywhere as per your wish. But still I did not get 100% and I wasted all my time, Damn it! Oh no! I’m not understanding how to convey what I feel towards him. do you remember the first time that I hugged you? Didn’t you feel anything then? That day, you hug me and asked me if your perfume was good... and I told you it was good right then and there, right? That day, I kissed you ,you remember? Didn’t you feel anything then ,at least? Yes I felt something. I had to go home and wash it off for two hours, I felt really irritated! Do you really not have any feelings for me? What are these feelings that you’re talking about? Anyways, I told you that day itself that all these were really bad habits. You also should not be doing any of these. Just sit at home and study well, that’s enough. I saw your innocence, and I fell in love with you. I thought you were really sensitive , but now I understood that you don’t have any sense. You don’t understand any feelings. All you know or formulas and equations. Loving a person like you I feel pity for myself. I came with really high hopes, to express my feelings towards you. But now I feel very bad for telling you this... I hate you. Shruti! It’s not - I hate you, it’s I am hating you, present tense... Damn! From then on, I never waste any more time and have come all the way to the campus interview. A person like you should not be in colleges or corporate offices. But instead they should be in the research centre or Salar Jung Museum. yeah! Thank you so much Sir Thank you? Oh gosh, don’t you know the difference between a praise and an insult? If I stay longer with you, I think I’m going to get mad and die. I need to go home immediately, and get drunk and just fall asleep. Stupid idiot! Oh okay sir, bye, take care. Oh gosh! I’m just going to drink some unknown alcohol and probably die. I think he is not feeling well! Raju, you have cleared all the rounds successfully. The final round is with our MD, please come. Raju Karampudi, right? Yes Sir. Three times topper, gold medalist, good. Looks like this job is confirmed. I should ask for a good package. But I’m sorry, you’re not selected. Sir? – Yes, you can go now sir... Sir ask me any question, I can answer you. Please ask me sir correct, there is no need to question a textbook Sir, but how can you decide that I am unfit for this interview, without even interviewing me? You see you are a topper. I meet hundreds of people like you every day, I get thousands of applications from all over the country but I select only a hundred of them. So I know who is the best. So please... Sir please can you tell me why you have rejected me? Not to give you an explanation, But I’m going to tell you because you should be knowing this. But before that, you must answer a few of my questions. please ask me sir, I have prepared a lot for this interview. Tell me the names of 3 friends, ever since your childhood. Sir I don’t have three friends, but I have one friend Who is that? Kiran sir Kiran. – yes sir Then he must certainly be a second rank student ? Do you guys ever meet up outside the class? We meet in the library as well as in the lab. So you have no friends outside? So you must not even be knowing the meaning of friendship or bonding, right? All you care about is books, books and ranks. So how would you even have any friends, man? What do you do to enjoy life? What do you find fun in life? I go to the library and read the reference books, and I participated in inter-college Educational debates sir. next, I really enjoy the learning apps on the iPad sir. Are these enjoyments for you? – Yes sir what about Sundays? Every Sunday I teach welding and tinkering in the mechanical workshop sir and I really enjoy that Sir. Are you serious? – Yes sir Hey Sunny... - Sir. you don’t come to the office on Sundays right? -No sir, I do not come What do you do on that day? I take my family out for movies or I’ll be partying with my friends sir. You can go. That’s his story. You see, Machine also will hang up if it’s made to work continuously for 24 hours. I’m not talking about the studies. I am asking what do you do to chill out? Like bunking the college, friends, movies, hangouts, parties. College is a lot of fun you see. No no, All those are done only by backbench students. Backbench students? Hello...even I am a back benchstudent. And that too I am a dropout. But I have built such a big company. Even the first rank student should come to a backbencher like me for a job. Anyways, if you study for 17 hours a day, you may get good knowledge but you will never get general knowledge. A guy who has studied the world and not just his books, is what I consider to be our first ranker. And you are a zero in that. I don’t want a rank student who just sits inside four walls. But instead, I want a bright student who can work together with everyone. Hello, What are you doing? Sir I am noting down all your requirements. If you listen to me, that is enough. I have a lot of machines with me. I need a person who can work with those and not just another machine. A man can make 100 machines. But even 1000 machines combined, can never make a man. You are just a rank machine. Sir, this is not fair Sir. Getting this job is my dream since 20 years. I have sacrificed my whole life for this. My mom and dad have kept really high hopes on me sir. Everything that I have studied has gone to waste. I cannot give you this job just because you’re crying or feeling sad. And on top of that, I Hate cry babies. You can go now Hey... -Sir. Here man, take the sweet. – Sir, what’s the occasion? My son went for an interview Here, come and take the sweet. Sir, how come you are distributing the sweets before even your son get the job. He is the first rank student, who else can get the job besides him. Oh there! He has come. Take the sweet kid! Where is the joining order? How much is the package? What happened my son? – Tell me dear Oh sir, you all are here? Please take this five Star chocolate what is this for? I thought my son was good for nothing. But he got a job in the same company! Your son got a job? Yes sir, monthly 25,000 Madam... Here you go. I have to give these to a lot more people too. I will get going Sir. Dear... He shut the door! My son... my son. Raju, Raju what are you doing? - Stop Raju. Please leave me, I want to die. - No...Raju, Raju. Please leave me, I want to die. - take that off quickly, Raju. Please leave me. I don’t deserve to live what is this my son, - what have you done? Who else do we have besides you? What is this Raju Sir, sir, sir... Please stop sir. – Hey... move a side. Sir, sir, sir... Please stop sir who are you, Sir? You don’t have permission to go inside , Sir Sir Where is Mr Parthasaradhi ? you need to take an appointment to meet him. I want to meet him now Sir, you must not go in. – Satish, leave them Is he Mr Parthasaradhi? Sir, why didn’t you select my son sir? Sit down , sit down. Why should I select him? My son is the first ranker, what more eligibility do you need? This is not a corporate college to give admission based on ranks, it’s a corporate company. I’ve told your son before itself. He has 100% book knowledge but 0% general knowledge. Upon knowing that he didn’t get the job, My son was about to commit suicide sir. So what? So what? He didn’t have the basic thinking that... if he doesn’t get a job in this company, he should try in another company. If I give a person like this a job in my company... in the future, if there is any problem he will just leave everything and walk away. You see... if a system needs to work properly, the ram, hard disk, processor should be working perfectly. Even though all these are perfect, it still needs power to run. That power is the confidence inside us, which he totally lacks. And that’s not his fault. It’s yours... and the systems . Everyone influences him by telling him that if you don’t get a good rank you’re not fit for anything, and because of such influences these kids become like this specimens. He can’t even take a small deci... –Sir I don’t care about all this. What are you suggesting now sir? He still has a semester left. Before the completion of that semester, I’m going to make him a backbencher, just like you. Or else my name is not Shoban Babu Karampudi What is that smile sir? Do you think I can’t do it? Challenges are nothing new to me. I have challenged, as soon as he was born. Keep the appointment order ready! I’ll come back with video footage as proof! We will come back! What is this new attire? Shoban Babu Karampudi. Lakshmi, Lakshmi, Lakshmi... If the key has to change, the lock should change, initially! What did he say? That you were not normal, and instead, you were abnormal? Just give me a day time, I’ll bring you to this present trend! Just like me! He looks so weird right?! He looks like Sobhan Babu! Hey! Dog! Help.. Help... Daddy.. mummy... daddy. You also wear this, like actress Sridevi. -I don't want. Hey hey... what happened man? Why are you running like that? Are girls chasing you? No dad, dogs are chasing me! What is this Sir? What drama are you guys practising with these costumes? It’s not a drama man. I’m trying to change my son, to look trendy like your son! Like my son? Look at his dressing, Hair like a chimpanzee, that ear piercing, torned jeans, tattoos all over his body, he looks like an example of idiots. Life is like a roller coaster, sometimes the person who is on the top comes down, and the person who is at the bottom goes up! Life is a roller coaster. sometimes it goes up, sometimes it comes down. Ehh, just like this sir. Stop blabbering and give me a solution. How do I change him? That’s not so easy sir. It needs to be in our genes in our blood. Yeah idiots are born according to their genes and blood – correct sir ,huh? Give me an idea man. Sir, these days, just like how they teach you to cook in 30 days or to drive in 30 days, there are coaching centres to change any kind of person in 30 days. I thought coaching centres were only to correct a person.. it looks like they are there to spoil a person as well. Anyways, who is that Coach? Bobby, Bollywood Bobby. I am the ECG Do you mean a doctor? -No, director... Extraordinary creative genius. Not just that Sir, My guru has made 2 blockbuster flops in Bollywood and has come here to establish an acting school. Did they ask you? I want to give a little bit of buildup about you! Guru ji Tell the man! That I have sold two of my flats in Andheri,Bombay... and that you have kept an IP. – shut up! Will you have some coffee or tea or cold drinks? I would like to have some... – no no, my guru only takes hot Hot? Hot, without soda. He has already had. He drank early in the morning? Oh no..! he didn’t drink yet. I got it for him and he will have after pack up Did they ask you? I want to give even more buildup about you Guruji Tell them man. That I drink every day in the morning and after pack up... – Set up? (Escorts) Shut up! If you give me stupid build ups like this I will make you go and pack up. Bloody chi. -Chi? What kind of name is that? Sound so stupid my actual name is Chimpoo. But my Guruji calls me by a pet name as, Chi Chi... Chi... Sir, did you call me? No I was just saying Eww Stop it. Tell me what’s the matter? It’s nothing... -Oh there is nothing? So how come you called me? Call sheet is wasted... pack up! Bobby Sir Bobby Sir, the person I told you about over the phone is him! about him? Funny! What’s your age? Your weight? 75 Kgs You don’t have what it takes in you, you have no ease in your body, so there is no use for you in this industry, pack up! Bobby sir, he is not the candidate, it’s his son. Short film or feature film? My sons future film. Quite challenging. That’s why you have come to me! If it was a big film why would they come to you sir? – Correct. Huh? Where is your son? - Son... Oh gosh! By looking at the dressing of your son, it looks like I’m going to get colour blindness. Anyways, what’s this retro look, in these metro times! Costumes!! Bill 69,000?! Even if it is 69 lakhs, you must spend it! The better the production values the better your sons future film is going to be! Hey, you give me quantity of giving quality. Yeah, I’ll spend . I spent so much for his education, can’t I spent this much further quality. Next... – Make up your son’s training call sheet starts from tomorrow. Kid, ready kid. – Full ready. Camera. –Rolling sir Action Art... is a heart of life. Rest of everything, is a fart of life. Just how a person needs the nine apertures of his body, and or consists of nine expressions. Oh my gosh, what kind of comparison is this? Hey, Chi... Guruji. Ready? – Ready Guru Ji Good, you watch Laughter. -Good one. Peace Bravery. sympathy Sarcasm. Fear More fear. More and more fear. its fascination man, its fascination. -Sorry Guruji, I got confused. Both seemed similar. -Shut up. Romance Good one. This is how it’s done. Now let’s see you do it. Okay sir. This is laughter. One.. -This is peace This is bravery Three... This is sympathy. -fourth one. This is sarcasm -five. this is fear. -Six. this is romance Guruji, it’s supposed to be nine expressions right? But we have only shown eight. what about 9th one..? Oh no...! This is anger Do you know how to flirt? (Sight) I already have bad eyesight, right 1.5 left 1.75 Sorry Guruji Sight does not mean that. Once hit an eye (Wink your eye) I will cool it, Guruji I thought the kid was just A small book like Balasikha, but he is like a big book like Pedda Balasikha. We can’t do with a budget of Kshanam, we need a budget of Kshana Kshanam. Guruji I did not understand I thought I could wrap it up with 2-3 call sheets, but he needs 20 to 30 call sheets. This is KTM 390, racing bike. Actually, this bike... – But I already have a Scooty, right ? Hey... Hey man, this is not like a Scooty. This is a bike with a different technology. There is an accelerator here, there is a clutch here, there are five gears here. Yeah I know that all already. Just tell me how to ride it. Hey hey hey Hey... – Get on top and run. okay sir...

Do everything, all prayers like Religious rituals as well as Black magic rituals. All those must be done to you, not to my son. -The concept is not like the movie Premabhishekam, but instead it’s going to be like Arjun reddy! Okay okay, anyways, the college is going to reopen today again. Hurry up go fast. Yeah go hurry up. And on the way by some bathroom cleaning liquid and mop the whole college. Who are you man? You must always go late to the college, only then people will notice you. Yes that’s correct. With the entry of my son the whole country should notice. That’s a good dialogue. Make sure it’s not there in our movie. To keep it simple... if you show a trailer... it should go viral! All you need are some good shades. what is this attire? What is that hairstyle? What are those colours on your hair? Do you know about Raju? He is the best student of our college. He is my favourite student. Look at how decent he is and how dignified he looks. Who are you? Are you a new admission? Raj. The rockstar! Mahesh... – present sir. Divya... – present sir Raju... – he hasn’t come yet sir. First Rank Raju has not come? Present sir. wow. Let’s start the class.

Okay let’s go with Eve teasing then! What else can we write? What is this huge list dad? My son, this is your action plan for the next five months! To explain it in your words, it’s syllabus!! All the extracurricular activities that college going younsters are supposed to do during those days, are written here. You must go through them and enjoy them! What should I be doing first, dad? You must join in the hostel. What? Hostel? – Yes! Only your attire has been changed so far. Now you must change completely! If you want to be a backbencher, you must definitely join the hostel! But our principal knows that our house is right next to the college. He will not give me a room there. Here is where the twist comes in is it? Okay then do one thing, just lie lie..? Yes you must only tell lies, from here onwards! Now get going, go! Hi my son. – Hey kid, is everything okay? If you want to get a job, you must do all this. We can’t help it yeah! That’s okay dad. We only have five months left. You must complete the syllabus by then. I will video call you every day, and explain to you what you must do. You should record that, and listen to it again and do revision with it, every morning and evening. Sure, what should I be doing now? First you need to build strong friendship with the top most rogue batch in the college. Which batch is like that? Hello guys. Hey, it’s him – this guy? How come he looks so different? Hi... friends? No man, keep your friendship with yourself. We have already had enough. and if we be-friend you, your dad will come at bashes up again! What man, his dad hit you that day? You think it was just hitting? Hey man, why are you feeling bad? This is not real friendship. It’s all acting right? In this world, there may be a person without fitness, but there will never be a person without a Weakness. We have to take advantage of that. What has my life come to? I’m not even understanding the question paper! Hey man, hey... What are you writing man? Don't disturb me... Om Sai ram Didn’t you bring the cheating slip papers? Is no way, I hid the slip papers in my underwear. But still our principal caught me and took it away. Hey, if you fail this time, I’m going to handover my business to you. Be careful. We will buy your old papers, any old iron items. Hello madam, do you have any Iron items in your house to sell? Don’t worry dad, I am the rightful successor to your business! I will keep up our family’s pride. Wow! He looks like Robo 3.0 – Write, Write, Write! Bye, Raj.. Hi Raj, thanks a lot man.

Hey Nandu, hi man He is our friend, man -Hi... I am Raj, huh? Hey, move a little, man Hey, Nandu... How come he just went away like that? Who is he waiting for? Just like how we have a backlog in M1, he also has a back log love story... It’s a big story. Everyone falls for a girl by seeing her beauty, but he fell for a girl hearing her name I am Jessie... – Hi... from Kerala That girl doesn’t know how to speak in Telugu. And our guy doesn’t know any other language but Telugu. So because of this language problem... all he could do was just follow her and her Love story was stuck that way! No one ever knows when it will move forward. That’s it, that’s it. I told you right? Every person has a weakness. What is that girl's name..? -The girl’s name is, Jessie dad. Immediately, go to the girl... First Rank Raju? Yeah, that’s me. Bring up the topic of Nandu Do you know Nandu? Praise him in front of her, tell all good things about him. Since you are the college topper, she will believe whatever you say and she will go to him. Hey, look there Hi Nandu... I’m sorry. Previously, when you were following me, I Miss understood you. How come she is speaking in Telugu? – That’s what I’m not understanding. But Raj has told me all about you. I heard you were a very good person and a role model in the college. It seems that he is a role model Why are you surprised? How come you’re talking in Telugu? I am learning a little bit these days... so that there won’t be any language problem between both of us.

You guys start, I will join once he comes. Hey, once he makes the drink it’s a sin to keep it waiting. Drink up Hey he’s coming, just on the way Hey, is he the only friend? Not just him man. You, you, Bhanu, Chintu, we are all friends right? He’s also our friend yeah, but just because you think so, it doesn’t matter, he also needs to think the same. Hey, he’s a good guy. He’s really innocent. We are really lucky to have a friend like him. What’s the special, sir? My son completed half the syllabus in three months. Then, double the congratulations sir. -Thank you. Can I take an extra sweet I’m not a miser like you. Take it. what happened to you, son? Why are you like that? Dad, everything is okay but... If my friends find out the reason we are doing all this, they will feel really bad. I feel like we are betraying everyone. we are not really doing any of this. We are just doing all of this for this job. Anyways, you’re not cheating anyone. You are just enjoying with friends like everyone. No dad, I feel it’s best if you stop everything right now... Hey, are you mad? Even though I am persuading you so much, if you don’t want to listen to me then go. And Get lost. Okay dad, what do I have to do next? Love. -Love..? Yes my son. these days, there is no backbencher without a love story during the college days. According to me, there is no girl who can fall in love with our Raju. there is one girl dad! What are you talking about?! Yes dad, not just that... that girl also said “I love you to me”. Really? yeah. did you hear that Subbarao? then can I take another sweet sir? Don’t hesitate subbarao.. Please take the whole sweet box. But dad, right now she is hating me. Should I now return the sweet box ? Also puke out all the sweets that you ate so far. Tell me the reason, why? If I follow your suggestions.. can I get hundred percent.?? What is your opinion on love?? I love my mother...I love my father. Why you are choosing the corner seats, If we go for first row seats we can watch the movie clearly. I hate you No, it's not I hate you. It is I am hating you. Present tense Hey stop it.. Stop it.. Oh my god! Did you keep your iconic mark out here also.? Dad, previously you only told me to focus on rank, rather than on other extra curricular activities and that book knowledge is more important than general knowledge. Did I tell that? Yes..I only told that. I have given birth to you right, so I must have said it. Now what shall we do.. How can finish the syllabus quickly? Hello Subbarao. Guruji the his love story is very interesting. No, it is irritating me, chi chi ji Sir, see here. If you want to love a girl..It is as easy as watching Bahubali movie in the Theatre. But, If you want to love a girl that she is not showing interest toward you...It is as hard as making Bahubali movie. It's out of my creative imagination. Pack up.. Hey, Babi... It is my son's, life and death problem. Please help me Shit..shit..shit I can’t bare these type of sentiments in any way. Generally, your old generation concept is baby girls are born if we tell many lies. But our generation concept is most of the girls will fall in love if you tell many lies. The girl will fall in love easily if you simply tell her that I changed, just for you. But we have a twist here. There are more twists in your son’s love story, but less scenes. Unfortunately yes. -What is that twist? If he propose her directly she will not accept that.. but she accept if she likes him. Pack up. Guruji It will not work..That's why As an assistant director.. How dare you to tell to pack up in front of me?? Then what I can tell guruji... -Get some tea for me. Regular screenplay is not enough to bring her in our love track. We will play Sukumar's screen play. I am not getting you -That means reverse screenplay. Who is he? Why is he following me anywhere with the rose ? What do you want? -This is for you.. For what reason? This is also for you. What is that?? That is my progress card. All subjects with 99 percentage and thoroughly signed by the parents too.. So what? I will never even look at other girls. I never bunk classes like all the people in the college. I'm usually wear the formal dresses rather than the jeans and all.. I use specs for sight. I use books for marks And finally my name is Ramu. I am the bright student. Why you are telling all these things to me? For Impress to you. What...? Yes. I like you I love you also. I will slap you with my shoe so hard that it will tear. That’s why please don't buy the chappals from the footpath... and make sure to buy the footwear from branded companies. Puma is better. Idiot Thank you Stupid. Thank you so much. That is nice song. Madam order please Two cappuccino’s please... One boost (energy drink) for me Can i sit here? -No. Thank you. What are you doing here? Are you following me? -Yes I came here to know the result of yesterday’s Proposal. Hey...who is this funny guy? I am Ramu..First rank Ramu.. The bright student. Did you ever see your face in the mirror anytime? -This is a silly question. When I am standing in front of the mirror, will I see any other face like hers? Oh my god! I am getting irritated just by seeing your face and seeing your dressing style It's natural. you are looking like the exact Xerox copy of Mr.bean. Yes exactly No girl will ever be ready to fall in love with you. I am expecting this type of emotion from you.. Please continue your words.. I am scolding you.. -and I am listening to you, come on Look here...she looks like peacock and you are looking like crow. Then what about you? You are not looking like fighting hen. You just looking like a pig Hey.. how can you expect her to love you? You are mistaken,I don't want her love. Then..? -I just want her to hate me. Please hate me. Please hate me for my sake... Please tell her madam. Anyone would normally follow a girl so that they would love them, but he is following you for you to hate him.? Simple, If she loves me I will become a lover to her. If she hates me I will become clever just like him. He is my inspiration. Isn’t he our raju..?? What ?..Why has he totally changed like this ? Hello... if you hate me then I can change myself from ramu to Remo.. I want to change... come on... you have to hate me Hello why you are demanding us? -Please tell her Madam... Please hate me... Hate me. Why are you people leaving me from the middle of the scene? My dialogue is not completed yet please don't go away. Is this boost?? -Sir, boost is not available here. Then go, get lost and bring a glass of tea. Why has he changed? He changed and looks as stylish as Allu Arjun and manly like Mahesh babu.. For whom else..? -For this beauty only. Just Shut up Even though his changing dress and style changed, his character will not change. I know him very well. I just hate him. Okay leave. Can I try for his love? Go to hell The girl who thinks you have no feelings, must know that you have feelings for her. How can she know that? For that to happen... we need to plan for a cinematic scene After opening the scene, Look here.. The Girl is coming from that way Okay. While she is seeing you, you have to propose to her. Do you remember all the dialogues?? -Yeah I by-hearted them sir. By-hearting them is not enough here, you have to deliver the dialogues by the Heart. Okay...Carry on -Okay. Hey didn’t you tell about our tradition to her? Hey..Please stop it..stop it...Stop it.. That is not correct. That is old tradition. Bollywood Bobby is here. Come.. come.. come.. Give a hug dear..Give a hug dear Nice perfume...carry on. Hi Paddu Camera - It's rolling Action... Hi Raj... Hey what are you doing here.? What is this..Who is this new girl entering into scene? Where is our artist? Hey... -Tell me darling. Where are you..? I am busy with Syeraa shooting here You are looking very handsome. But she is doing well acting. -Are you okay with this? I was following you from the day you winked at me. Why are you following me..? I think... -Ha..You think? I think.. I love you. What a lovely dialogue delivery? I am sorry Sahana... You were loving me since only one month. But when I used to be first rank raju... one girl loved me. But I hurt her a lot. Now I changed myself only for her love. But the girl is not understanding that... It's a fantastic and super shot. Didn’t I tell you already? He changed himself for your love . Let’s go, we are getting late to class. She is so lucky. I already asked to cut the shot but why is she still crying.. Guruji... I guess she is a good artist. Right..! Don't forget to take the blessings in the evening time. -Okay guruji Sir will you take the blessings? Okay leave him..He is not showing interest.. Fantastic performance. You are the next Kangana Ranaut! If you come to my office room in the evening time, I will give a big break to you along with the blessings. Come, Let's do our tradition... Come, come on give a hug to me. Oh now I understood the meaning of your blessings. No sir..Still I didn’t understand..Who is she? Sir, is she not a referral from you? The scene was fail...? -Pack up... Has he changed himself for my love? Really I can't believe this. Hello... -Hello..where are you now? My bike is punctured. -Book a cab and come fast. It’s time, the show is going to start. Okay. -Come fast...bye Hey look, that girl is very hot Hey come everyone. Okay, bye. What happened baby..Your bike is punctured? I have a bike, you want a sharing ride? Or do you want to go in my car? It will be comfortable for everyone! That’s an awesome idea bro! Hey,You think you’ve come here like a hero? Just stick with that thought! you mean, you’re going to hit us? Any doubt..? Did you see how many of us are here? There are 10 of you. Come fast...I finish you all... and I can go home and sleep peacefully. No man, we will only go home, get drunk and sleep Hey man, what are you talking? -Hey leave it Bro. Guruji... -Yeah... why are these guys continuously telling so many dialogues, just like tele-branding anchors. Hey, there’s going to be a fight scene now. -Oh..Is it.! Bobby planned a big action episode with 10 fighters. He is the hero. She is the heroine. We are the villains. The hero came to save the heroine. Why do you want to get beaten up by the hero? Let’s go Hey, why are you defaming us? – Let’s go.. let’s go bro. The same thing happens in all the movies. Get in get in. – let’s go fast Hey, why are the fighters going away? That’s what I’m trying to tell Guruji. They are not our people. Then where are our people? – They still didn’t come sir. why...? you still have not given them their advance payment What is this? Why are they going away? Is there no fight now? What? It looks like you are really disappointed. – Won’t I be? You think your son is a power star or a superstar? He is just a debut hero. If we make him fight, the audience won’t accept it. Shall i drop you at the hostel? -Aha..Yaa. Oh my god! we are getting drenched in the rain Now what can I talk? The rain is really cold ,isn't it?? Yeah But it is very nice. Thanks brother Bye. What is next? Next... A little romance would have happened while they were on riding the bike... I meant to say, First physics and after that chemistry. she may naturally have been disturbed with all those romantic moments at that time. Once we begin the story... Moon light.... Balcony.. a beautiful wind effect... By that wind effect sruthi hair is flying. Wherever she is looking,.. Our hero is to be seen. why am I being disturbed so much? Anyway..I like this feeling Maybe people call this feeling as love? Even sruthi must have felt the same way ??? Really it seems like a dream. You are my truth- you are my dream... forever in me... You've become this moment- you've become an era- today! Once my heart had come to know that our souls met there hasn't been peace ever since... From this day on- love has begun. You are my truth- you are my dream... forever in me... Right now- my heart doesn't think of anything but you Even if you've been away all this while- you've been my heart beat! What a struggle it had been all these years... as soon as you've come it became very sweet... is this all your magic? You are my truth- you are my dream... forever in me... I've tried to rein my heart in vain which seems to not let go off your shadow. My age thrillingly got trapped in the sharp gaze of yours! This moment swears that there are no longer two of us. but one- Which one should I trust today? Sir, if you are suffering from BP please consume this tablet. If you have a heart problem, call the ambulance before itself. If you hear The matter which I am going to reveal you, you will be as shocked as hearing the news that Hyderabad is effected by the tsunami. But definitely I have to tell you. What happened sir? usually your son sits in the first bench and always gets the first rank. But in recent days, he is sitting in the last bench and has totally turned into a rougher and a bad person, Not attending the classes regularly and even Teasing the girls... wait a moment sir. -ok I am waiting what did you take from below you? and what is there in that? Tell me now. Not attending the classes regularly. Here... He is passing crude comments at the faculty Super. Even he is teasing the girls too...

Sir let me speak Sir, if you are suffering from B.P please consume this tablet If you get an attack with the heart stroke call the ambulance before. Why Sir? If you hear the matter which I am going to tell you... you will be as shocked as hearing the news that Hyderabad is effected by the tsunami along with Secunderabad. But definitely I have to tell you. Tell me sir The person who told him to do all these things, is none other than.... me! Oh no...! Hey chi.. Even though the scenes are going in the reverse direction... we are still getting positive results from it. Guruji you always play with the reverse screenplay. I will give a break to you Anyways, the scheduled is completed.. go and ask for the check The entire syllabus is completed but just one part is left. Sir..What about check? Which check?? Hello, that girl still didn’t propose to my son If the song is completed, it obviously means that she proposed. I want video footage. Yet, that thing is still pending... Sir, a rose is enough for a boy to propose to a girl. We can easily get that done. But a special day is need for a girl, to propose to a boy. Valentines day? There is no valentines day in the month of may! You April fool. Only Mothers day is in the month of may. Yeah that's beautiful sir.. Please go and take blessings. Next week my retirement day... How can be, we can arrange that sentimentally on that day? Absolutely fine! In the same day, please arrange your shasthi poorthi ceremony (60 years birthday) as well. Then she will come and give a flower Garland to you and give her wishes and she will go. After that...take that video and make it viral. An occasion that we are planning should have lots of joy, and fun!. Birthday..!!! Sorry guruji. -What is that? Sorry guruji. -What is that? Sorry guruji. -Hey chi. For the first time in your life, your brain chip is working !. Take my blessings What..fake birthday...?? Dad I don’t think any of this is fine. You made me play so many rouge dramas for their friendship.. Now you are telling me to do the same thing to make her fall in love ?. I feel we are cheating sruthi, really badly.. Please dad, let’s stop all of this right now, and we will reveal everything in front of others. My dear son 'Satya harischandra' (a person who always tells the truth) Have you gone mad? If she propose to you, the entire syllabus will be complete. Not only that , furthermore, you will get the job too ! After she proposes you.. If you still wish to do so, convey everything to her. We will not stop you. I don’t mean that dad... please listen to me. What dear.. You changed the living room into a trail room? I think this is for Birthday party, right? You are still not getting it? For everyone it is a birthday party. But for her it is valentines day. Happy birthday Raj! Ha Thank you What is this? Why are only juniors coming? Where is the main heroin? Even for this duplicate birthday.. Is it necessary to maintain a dress code..? Please wait and watch for few minutes .. At that time of her proposal, if you see the setup that was made by me, you will all shake and shiver! Raju is giving such a huge party. Why didn’t any of us bring him a nice gift? I thought you were bringing the gift -And I thought you brought the gift. -We all thought in the same way itself... -I think there is no need of a gift I will bring it buddy I think you are giving too much priority to him Buddy. Buddy I met the love of my life, Jessie because of him . He is the symbol of a true friend buddy. -Then what about us, man? Everyone else’s priority as a friend to me, is only, after him. Buddy go away..Go away.. -5 minutes What man? How is he the best friend, just because he set him up with his girlfriend.? Then, who are we to him? How would I know ? Are we not his friends? Don’t take it too seriously man. -Hey why shouldn’t I bother about it? Look there the heroine has arrived! -Is it? I am the director here Only I have the right to tell that. Hi... -Hi. Happy birthday day Raj. -Thank you You are looking Superb. -Thank you I know you have dressed up for Nandu.. right? Why is he giving the rose at the door itself? -That is what, I am not able to understand.. I struggled a lot to make this setup for the proposal scene. Did you not tell that to him? -Guruji I already told him that. I can't get understand why he is behaving like that. He is giving priority to him, only because of this beauty..Isn't it? I will tell you Hey waiter... come this way.. Excuse me..Where is nandu? Sorry... I don't know? Madam... juice. -Thank you Hi Mahesh... Hi.. hi.. jessie... how are you? Where is Nandu?

Please cut the ponytail off. Hey Make sure that it gets chopped off as soon as possible. I can't tolerate this type of inconvenience. What a couple? What a composition? Hey sruthi. Why is shruthi here? Dad she is not shruthi. She is Jessie. Jessie Scene is totally mixed up like yellow rice. Ethically this is not correct time for us to stay here. Can I ask for a check in this situation?? -If you ask him now, he will slap you with his shoe. Is there any flight to Mumbai right now?? Ha..Train is available guruji.. That's enough... Pack up. Please listen to me -Nandu. Please listen to me. It is not that Nandu... -Please listen me Hey Jessie once you at least please tell.

Come to auditorium...I will tell you..Come. -Hey what happened? Nandu..I am telling the truth. Please trust me. See this... We have only 5 months time. You need to complete your syllabus within that period of time. I will give my suggestions to you through the video calls. You record that and do revision. what do I have to do first? First you need to build strong friendship with the top most rogue batch in the college. If you press the switch in the downstairs... then lift automatically will come down. What is her name?? -Her name is jessie, Dad. Hey don't miss the opportunity with the miss. -You did this to me just for a job..?!! Hey, that is... I used to chant about our friendship in the whole campus everyday. Hey..Now, I get irritated by calling you my friend. Buddy I was try to tell the truth at that time itself. -What are you saying buddy? At that time, your father had beaten us for a silly reason, like ragging.. Did we say anything to you? -Hey buddy not like that..Sorry yaar..Sorry yaar Hey stop it buddy The entire college know that your love with Jessie Even though, he spoiled your love by playing the the double game. buddy what are you talking.. I can't understand. -You shut up. poor fellow..He always gives important priority to our friendship. How can you let him down? by your stupid actions... Buddy, he himself and his words are totally fraud, he himself is a cheat ! That is raju's real character. Hey Nandu..He is not our friend first rank raju. He is selfish raju. Hey don't leave him. -Hey don't leave him. Hey Nandu... Hey, No Buddy. You did a blunder mistake. It is not the correct way buddy. hey please listen me. Please don't beat me. Please listen to me yaar. Hey, please... Oh no..! Hey stop it buddy. Enough, He will die, if you hit him more. At least I want to tell the truth to Sruthi. Geetha... where is Shruthi? What happened? -Tell me where is shruthi? She got a call from auditorium. She went there. What happened? Our syllabus will be completed if she comes and proposes. Not only that, the next day you will get a job too. Sruthi please listen to me once. I loved you by seeing your innocence I came to know.. by seeing all these things You are not an innocent guy. You are a liar ... you are a cheater You are misunderstanding me..?? You know what... I hate you No..No.. I am hating you. Sruthi once listen to me Sruthi... please listen to me Sruthi... Go away. Hey raju.. Where are you going? I am sorry dad. I am unable to complete the syllabus this time. I have failed this time. why you are speaking like this? Hey why are you worrying??? it is just an acting. It is only a syllabus. Love and friends are not a syllabus dad. They are feelings. Whatever the happiness I have lost from past 22 years. Now I found it from them, 6 months of friendship. when I met and loved Sruthi.. I realised that I too have a heart and feelings in it. Right from first day, you just told how to score the marks in the exam but you didn't tell me how to lead a life. If you had told all these aspects along with the studies like other parents... today I would not have become like this. Hey..Where are you going? Even I don't know dad..Where I am going. But this is surely not the meaning of life. I want to learn what life is really about. So for that.. -Don’t worry dad.. As per your wish, I will come and attend for the job interview. I love you mom I love you dad. For the outer space(sky), clouds are their only companion For my life journey, silence is the only companion Despite the many lights, darkness is my only companion Even amongst thousands of people, solitude is my only companion Only after a lengthy soul search could I know about myself. I’m walking alone on the path to an unknown destiny. For the outer space(sky), clouds are their only companion Let me separate from the shadow of yesterday Let my vision be that the days ahead are bright and hopeful. This is how I will continue to learn about this world. Time has now taught me the life lessons. With the lessons leaned, will I ever have the companionship of a good life? For the outer space(sky), clouds are their only companion I am sorry dad I was unable to get good marks in this exam too. So they kept me in red list. In front of the entire students, the principal scolded me. And finally they threw me away from the campus with the TC. I tried number of times to get a good marks But I was incapable to score. I have a great desire towards cricket rather than academics I am unable to convey my dream to you that I want to become a good cricketer, because I am scared that you will beat me. Instead of killing my aspirations, I am killing myself. please forgive me dad. I love you mom. within few minutes our education minister Aakula shivareddy will arrive to the function. In the mean time, students who secured good ranks will be presented with the medals with our principal. Sumanth. 98.6 percentage Rashmi 98.7 percentage Hey what is this 98.6 and 98.7 ? They sound like decimals to measure the temperature of fever in the thermometer. You can see the photos of today's rank holders in tomorrow's newspaper. Rahul 32 percentage you can see his photo also in tomorrow's newspaper. but, in the suicide column Breaking news.. To the MNR corporate school function our education minister is cordially attending as a chief guest, but subsequently a strange person enters with a dead body to that place. It created a huge sensation. who are you? what is this nuisance.? Nuisance...!!!??? A student committed the suicide because of you... does this look like a nuisance for you sir.? See, He did not score good marks in his academics. To preserve our school reputation we gave the T.C for him, and sent him away. He committed the suicide, for that reason.. Then why are you questioning us as if we killed him? are you creating an issue on this right now? what is real cause? who is that student? who is that stranger? what is the relation between the stranger and student who committed suicide.? sir, This issue is not only for this person. If there are 100 students in the class room, Only one of them can getting a first rank. The issue is about remaining 99 students sir. Only in our state, every year, more than 500 students commit suicide. This issue is about all of them. He died due to lack of caliber in academics. - sir media is observing us. let it be man Everybody is getting used to accuse us see now everyone should know about this. The main aim of this school is... to create the students as good rank holders. Those who studied with us, or are studying with us and those who are going to study with us, must all definitely be rank holders, not like this failure student. A person like you should be telling the student that, "Failure is the stone to the step of the success". But you instead send away the students with the TC just because he failed in a small exam? How can we even call you as a teacher?? Every moment you compelled him to only get a first rank. But did you ever focus on him at least once, to find out in which field he has interest? If you have noticed his interests , then he surely would not have been dead today.. Rahul loves cricket. He used to play cricket around 8 hours, everyday. that's why he became an average student. It's none of my business. If you gain good marks only then can you secure quality results. plenty of admissions-plenty of money And education is my bloody business. You got it. Now a days Everybody is coming in front of the media to draw the special attention, even for silly things like these... Tell me, how much money do you want? I will give you... But don't ruin the function’s atmosphere. Will he come back to life with your money ? so, you will not leave from here.?? security... -Sir..Sir.. Poor fellow..He don't want money. Give him what he wants and send him out. In one of the well reputed corporate school, rankers can only study in that school. If the person didn't score good marks then they are unfit to study there and that is the rule of the school. Hey why they are beating like that.??? School administration was unable to answer the questions asked by the strange person. So he was beaten brutally. Is education for the ranks or to gain the knowledge. For the sake of ranks and reputation, the corporate schools are turning the students into robots. Sir please see this video. Stop it. Welcome sir..welcome Ceremony is that side sir. The young man was creating an issue..So.. please come sir..Please come sir.. I'm observing everything.. The died victim is not a puppy in our home.. He is a student in the school. There is a reason behind the issue which he raised. I think you didn't have the proper clarity in what you are trying to say, look into it once.. What is this young man? Why are you risking your life.?? who are you? why you are taking such a risk for that boy? I am a first rank student. Once upon a time, I received a medal from your hands sir. I was that first rank student. In school exams, I attained the first rank where as in life exam , I stood as a failure. I was the first rank raju sir. No one should not become like me. Education is not a business. Brother.. If I fail in the exam, I die too? Just like this? No way dear. What you learn in the school, it is just meant for exams. Afterwords, obviously we will forget it. But, lessons learned in the life will be with us throughout our life. We have to acquire the first rank in that. Look there... Those are photos displayed in your school. None of them are first rankers. But in every aspect of their life they stood in first place all the time. I am requesting the parents who are here, Kindly don't rub your first rank desires into your children’s brains. A Leopard is a fast runner . A Fish is a good swimmer But if you ask a Leopard to swim and a fish to run on the land, both will be losers. Please understand why your children are not studying well. Encourage them and search the talent in your children. Find out their interests. If this can be done, then in every school there will be a Sachin Tendulkar. And in every class, there will be an Abdul Kalam. Right now I did not have any objections to give this job. And this is my offer. Sorry sir..I am not here for this job. What!!?? Yes sir. Because of you.. I came to know not only about life, but also how to lead my life in a progressive way. Thank you sir. Sorry buddy I did a big mistake. -Hey raj..Raj.. Raj... I am so proud of you. Sorry Pardasaradhi garu... I should have behaved like that. No, no... No need of sorry you only were right at the end of the day. For children's better future, parents will go out of their way... You proved it, yet again Go man...Go.. I am sorry It's okay I love you Uhu...I am loving you. Idiot See my dear son.. If you study well and get first rank then you will grab a job in MNC company. Are you listening? -Yup daddy What is your name? -Rahul Good If you do hard work., You can only get a job in this kind of company. If you follow your heart, and do things according to your wish then this kind of company will be you own! Sir why are you telling him that?? Is that possible anywhere?? By the way.. who are you? The company you are showing now, belongs to me..
