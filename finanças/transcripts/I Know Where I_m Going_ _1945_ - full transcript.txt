When Joan was only one year old, she knew where she was going. Going right? Left? No, straight on. When she was five, she was writing, "Dear Father Christmas, I don't want a doll, "and I don't want a big red ball. "What I want is a pair of silk stockings. And I mean silk, not artificial. " She was 12 before she got her first pair of silk stockings, and they were artificial. See? All the other giris are waiting to catch the bus. And waiting. Look at her. Here she comes, straight for the milk van. Is she going to get a lift? She is. At 18, she's a working girl, and she still knows what she wants. A boy wants to take her to the movies... twice a week, if she'll let him. She would rather have a dinner at the best hotel in town, even if he can only take her once a month. There she is, that tall, skinny girl. Will he take her? He will. She's 25 now, and in one thing she's never changed. She still knows where she's going. Good evening, Miss Webster. Good evening, Leon. Hello, darling. I got your telegram. I thought you were spending your holiday at home. Oh, I'm sorry, but you see me every weekend. - Did you bring my money? - Yes. Here you are. Forty seven pounds, ten and nine. Would you sign the receipt and count the money? You don't mind my taking it all out, do you? It's your own money. As your bank manager, I'd prefer you to leave the account open. As your father, I... Nothing for me, thank you. Oh, but you must have something tonight. He'll have a sherry. And the usual for you, Miss Webster? Bring him a gin and Dubonnet. You have no consideration at all for my position. Oh, darling, be reasonable. Just think of all these giris here. They've all got fathers who have positions. Not everybody's father is a bank manager. Thank you, miss. Darling... please stop being a bank manager for once. Just be my father for tonight. Now look here, Joan, I've come all the way here from Eccleshall, and you know I don't like being seen in expensive places. - You know what my clients will say... - Daddy, I'm going to be married. What? - Your table, Miss Webster. - Thank you, Fred. Let's go in, darling. Bring your drink. Diamond, huh? Who is he? Excuse me. That's a works pass of the CCI. You can't marry Consolidated Chemical Industries. Can't I? No other name on this except your own and... - You can't mean... - Just what I do mean. Robert Bellinger's one of the wealthiest men in England. Anything wrong with the soup, Miss Webster? Oh, we were talking. It's cold now. Will you take it away? Certainly. - Excuse me. - Now here, Joan, stop acting. You're not Lady Bellinger yet. Anyway, you'll come with me to the station. - Tonight? - I'm picking up the Scotch Express there. - Going to Glasgow? - Further. The Western Isles. - Have you got your ticket? - It's all arranged. Everything's arranged. - I'm going to an Island called Kiloran. - Where is it? In the Hebrides. It takes a day and a night to get there. It's his island. We're going to be married there, away from people. - Have you ever been there? - Often. - What? - In my dreams. He's told me all about it. There's an old house, and the war's a million miles away. There are famous sands and sheep and birds and Atlantic seals. Bellinger must be nearly as old as I am. And what's wrong with you, darling? - Come on, Daddy, let's dance. - No, no, Joan. Oh, come on, Daddy. You can dance. You taught me to dance. - Good evening, Hunter. - Good evening. Follow me. Excuse me. - I hope you will be comfortable, miss. - Thanks, Mr. Hunter. I managed to prevent them from putting you over the wheel. It's lovely, Hunter. - See you in the morning, Miss Webster. - Yes, please. We get in at 6:30. I'll call you half an hour before, all right? Yes, thank you. Very good, Miss Webster. Thanks, Mr. Hunter. It was very clever of you to get a sleeper, Hunter. Sir Robert's orders. - Not so easy these days, all the same. - We have our methods, sir. - This is my father. - How do you do, sir? Here is an itinerary that I had prepared at Sir Robert's desire. Would you study it? When you arrive at Glasgow, you change to Buchanan St. Station. Mr. MacAllister, director of the Bellinger Metal Works, will meet you on your arrival at the central. - You arrive at Oban at 11:30. - Just leaving, sir. Oh, I must be off. Excuse me. - Good-bye. - Good-bye, Hunter. Good-bye, Daddy, darling. Send me a wire. I'll be back in a week. Hunter will give you the address. - Good-bye, darling. God bless you. - Good-bye, Hunter. - Good-bye, miss. My very best wishes. - Don't forget to write. Darling, don't worry about me.

Lady Bellinger's car! # You take the high road and I'll take the low road # # And I'll be in Scotland before thee # Next station, Gretna Green. You're over the border now. - Glasgow Central! - Oh! Yes? There's a gentleman to meet you. The station master's with him. - Miss Webster? - Yes. - I'm MacAllister. - How do you do? - This is Mr. Finney. - How do you do? - It's a grand day. - It is. You'll need all your time to get to Buchanan Street. Here. Miss Webster? I'm David MacBraynes's agent. It's a fine day. - Miss Webster. - How do you do, Captain? Yes, yes. I had a letter about you from Mr. Lee. It is your first visit? - Yes, it is. - 'Tis a sublime day. - Miss Webster? - Yes? Be getting in quickly, Uncle Bridie. It's a pity about the day. An hour ago, it was very pretty. Ah, but it never stays fine for long in the isles. You'll soon get used to it. Are you for Kiloran, Miss Webster? - Yes. Is it far to Port Erraig? - Quite a step if you walk. Only 40 minutes if you have a car, and you have a car. Port Erraig is down yonder behind the trees. That is Moy Castle, the ancient home of the MacLaines of Erraig. - Where do they live now? - Down there in Erraig House. Ah, but they'll all be dead now or in New Zealand. There will only be Catriona MacLaine. Is anyone allowed in the castle? Oh, yes, anyone can go in, except the lairds of Kiloran. There's a curse on them. What sort of curse? If they should ever set foot across the threshold, man, they say it's a terrible strong curse. Hear ye! - I'd better go down. - Will I take them for you? - Oh, no, I can manage. - I'd better wait a wee while. Ruairidh Mhor may not be willing to cross over to Kiloran in this weather. Oh, no, my fiance is coming over to fetch me. Oh, so the rich gentleman in spectacles is your fiance? Yes. "Well, well, a thousand blessings on you both." Thank you. But in a fog like the one that's coming up, your fiance won't see any better with six pairs of spectacles than with one. Good-bye. - Good evening. - Good evening. Oh, bad luck. No crossing today. - But isn't that the boat from Kiloran? - No. And if she was, it is not today she'd be getting back, milady. That's the ferry boat. Pity you didn't keep lain's car. That's why I was shouting. But we didn't understand. Why should I keep it, anyway? To go back to Tobermory and spend the night in a comfortable bed. But I intend to spend the night on Kiloran. Oh. Would you like to wait up at the house? I know the people. Thank you. But it's been arranged for the boat to meet me here, and I'd better be here to meet it. Good. It's the big house up the bray. Is that Gaelic you're talking? Yes, milady. What would it be but the Gaelic? - - What's that noise? - That would be the seals' signal, miss. - The seals? Yes, yes. They like the warm, foggy weather. If my boat doesn't come, will you take me? No, I will not, milady. Port Erraig, 5:15 p.m. The boat from Kiloran will meet Miss Webster... Good evening. I'm looking for the house. You'll see a wee gate up the bray. Thank you. Hello? May I be the first to welcome you to these halls, young lady? I was just going to get you. Come on in. We've lit the fire. You've met the colonel, I see. I've had that pleasure. My name's Barnstaple. Colonel Barnstaple. - The greatest hawk trainer... - Falconer, my dear Torquil. The greatest falconer in the Western Isles. In the worid, old boy. Catriona's out. She's our hostess. She's no idea you and I are here, but she'll find a corner for us. She's a grand girl, bless her heart. I've known here since we were kids. She married an Englishman called Potts. He's in the Middle East, and the kids at boarding school. - How's business, Colonel? - Fair. I've got a new line now. Eagles. I've been training a golden eagle for seven months. An eagle! Hunting with it, like a hawk? That's shaken you. Where is it? I'd like to see it. Sorry, old boy. I lost him four days ago, and I haven't got him back yet. Where did you see him last? On Golly's leap. I was trying with rabbits. And the blighter lost interest, sailed off and disappeared in a cloud. Every day I'm out after him. I've trodden that mountain almost into the ground. But I'll get him back. - Catriona! - There's the dear girl now. Torquil! Mrs. Potts! Brown stuff, this Gaelic. Still got those half-starved hounds? How do you feed 'em? Oh, we live off the country. Rabbits, dear, a stray hiker or two. What do you expect me to do? Eat them myself just when the strain's getting known? How's that for bone? Look at that head, eh? Torquil, it's good of you to come and see an old bag like me. - Good evening. - This is a fellow traveler to Kiloran. Oh, I see. Ruairidh wouldn't take you over. You're right, but I love you just the same. I came over on the midday bus just to see you. - This is Miss... - Webster. - Miss Webster. - How do you do? How do you do? I'm sorry I didn't see you. It's Torquil's fault. - You'll stay here tonight. - I don't want to be any trouble. Oh, it's no trouble at all. I haven't heard any intelligent female nonsense for months. Besides, there's nowhere else you could go. Oh, don't worry. You won't have to sleep on the floor, though the men will. I don't know which way you came, but I suppose you noticed the place was knocked about. Well, it did look a bit bleak. Oh, it's no wonder. I only just got rid of the boys. - What boys? - Well, the RAF, of course. I've had them for two years, 80 of them, no less. But surely they'll compensate you for the damage. Oh, yes, they've been very fair about that, apart from trying to sell me their concrete foundations. I wasn't having any. No, they'll pay a lump sum, or do the place up as it was. - After the war, of course. - Which are you gonna take? That's the question, Torquil, my boy. MacLaine versus Potts. - Will you have a draft? - Certainly. Help yourself. We'll get dinner. We'll make a pie. The colonel says you're a dead shot these days. My dear Torquil, I have a tip that will improve your own shooting. After scrounging a few cartridges out of the local comptroller, find a sitting rabbit, take aim, say to yourself, "If I don't shoot this rabbit, I don't eat," and you don't miss. - And she doesn't. - What's your other name? - Joan. - Mine's Catriona. Can you skin a rabbit? That's a queer girl. - What do you young chaps know about giris? - Nothing. Not a thing. Then you know as much as I do. Taming a woman must be worse than taming an eagle. Can't be done, old boy. It can't be done. - How's the war treated you? - Not bad. Saw the worid. - Been home much? - Not for four years. - Staying long? - Eight days. Not much. There's a right way and a wrong way to skin a rabbit. I only know the wrong way. Colonel, you're wanted. On parade! Hear any bells, either of you? I thought for a moment it was the old boy, back again. - Colonel! - Right! - What did he think he heard? - His eagle. A little odd, isn't he? Who isn't? Oh, it's Kiloran! It looks huge. Six inch to the mile. If the winds gets up, it'll soon blow the fog away. - Sounds as if it is. - Are you staying long on the island? - A few days. - You know anyone there? - Mm-hmm. - It's a fine island. - I know. - Been there before? No, but I've heard all about it. - Do you know it well? - I've known it for 29 years. I shouldn't have thought you as old as that. Four years older. Are you staying on the island? I've got eight days leave. I want to spend it there. Do you know Sir Robert Bellinger? No, I've never met him. Does he know you're going to Kiloran? No. Do you know him? - Very well. - Nice chap. - The nicest. - I'd like to meet him. Well, you're bound to, aren't you, on a small island like Kiloran? It's not so small. I heard you could walk it in an hour and a half. I suppose you can if you want to, but who wants to? There are better things to do. - Such as? - Shoot grouse, fish for salmon, bathe in Kiloran Bay, picnic at Pig's Paradise. - Where's that? - On the north shore. There's an eagles' aviary there. I promised to take the colonel. Oh, so the colonel's going too? Yes. He's got a permit from Bellinger. - So one does need a permit? - In wartime, for ordinary visitors. But I'm staying with a factor. He's got a house on the west side. Kiloran House is near the lake, isn't it? The loch, yes. Who is it? It's me. I'vejust been outside. It's much clearer. With luck, we'll be able to cross in the morning. - Oh, thanks for telling me. - See you in the morning. - Good night. - Uh, good night. You can see the trees now. In half an hour, you'll be able to see the shore. In half an hour, I shall be asleep. There's a grand view of Kiloran from here. At sunrise, the light shines on the sands. With a glass, you can make out the people. Have you got a match or a lighter? Thanks. Thank you. Are you engaged? Yes. I'm going to be married on Kiloran. It's an honor for Kiloran. Well, may your pulse beat as your heart would wish. - Thank you. - Is it to be soon? Tomorrow, weather permitting. - Have you got any beams in your room? - Yes. Why? Count them before you go to sleep, and your wish will come true. - As easy as that? - For only the first night. People in modern houses don't know what they're missing. Good night. I warn you, it doesn't work if you don't believe in it. One, two, three, four, five. Please, Lord, don't let the wind drop, and let it blow the fog away. Good morning, Miss Webster. Good morning. Your counting beams certainly works. Trouble is, you wished too hard. - Why? What's the matter? - We've had a gale warning. What will that mean? - Ruairidh Mhor will tell you. - How long will the gale last? Oh, just as long as the wind blows, milady. It can last for a day. It can blow for a week. It looks so near. In half an hour, we could be there. In less than a second, you could get from this worid into the next. - Can I speak to the island? - By radio, from the Coast Guard post. - Can civilians still use it? - Yes, yes. - Where is the Coast Guard post? - Tobermory. - Can we get a car? - No need. We can go by bus. Ruairidh, we'll be at the Western Isles Hotel. I think perhaps we'd better move into the hotel. We're a bit of a strain on Catriona's household. Oh, yes, of course. All right, then. Breakfast? And cheer up. Oh, I'm all right. - Very difficult. - Crazy. It was a compromise. The post office wanted it up the hill; Catriona, below. But why just here? It was a dry summer when they put it here, and they forgot the rain. Hello? - It's all right. You have a big room. - What about you? Oh, I have a small one. Now's my chance to see the castle. I suppose you've been inside hundreds of times. - No. - Haven't you, really? - Are you coming in now? - No, I don't think so. But you needn't be afraid of the curse that's on the castle. What have you heard about that? Well, I know that it's upon the lairds of Kiloran. I don't know whether the wives or the future wives... of the lairds are involved, but I'll risk it. - Coming? - I'd better introduce myself. I am MacNeil of Kiloran, and I am the laird of Kiloran. Sir Robert Bellinger has only rented it for the duration. I see. There's not much difference. It's his for the time being. Are you afraid? My father never entered Moy Castle, nor did my grandfather or his father, and nor will I. How on earth can you stand it? Aren't you curious? No. It's always been like that. Shall we go? Excuse me, sir. Are you not MacNeil of Kiloran? - Yes. - Oh, curse the heavens. I knew you when you were a boy, Kiloran. Knew your father well. My wife is from the island. Katie Clark. - Katie Clark? - Mm-hmm. Then you're John MacAllister. Yes, yes. You have your father's memory, Kiloran. - And are you back for good, Kiloran? - Only a week's leave. - Oh, dear. - But it won't be long now. Ah, no indeed. I'm waiting for the boat. How is everybody on Kiloran? Hmm, well, now. They're fine. They're very fine. And my son was after telling me about the rich man on Kiloran. Him that is your tenant, Kiloran. Like a little king, he is. Yes, yes. My wife's second cousin... was working up there the entire spring... on a swimming pond he was building. - A swimming pool. - Oh, what foolishness. And the hold wide open sea to be swimming in. - Aye, and the loch. - Money spent is money earned. Ah, yes, yes. My wife's second cousin was not complaining. Meat does not fall from an empty krill. He has no care of money, the rich man of Kiloran. He brings salmon with him from the mainland. - The waters here are full of salmon. - Who is fishing for salmon? But who would be fishing when there's no one to be buying? So he would have to start buying before anyone would start fishing. But can't he now fish for himself? No, he cannot. He has the finest tackle from Glasgow, but the fish don't know him. Yes, yes, the fish do not know him, no. What are all the guns for? Ah, we're losing lambs. There's an eagle been seen. - Aye, a golden eagle. I could hardly wish them good hunting. - Hardly. - You didn't mind what they said? I thought it was nonsense. Why shouldn't one build a swimming pool? Personally, I like swimming pools. - A matter of taste. - Exactly. I also prefer to call up the fishmonger if I want to eat some salmon... instead of wading about knee-deep in water, waiting for salmon to pass by. - Really? - Really. "The Legend of Corryvreckan"? It's the second-biggest whirlpool in Europe. It lies just northeast of Kiloran. "Corry" means cauldron or whirlpool. "Vreckan" was a prince of Norway. He sought the daughter of the lord of the isles in marriage. Hello, hello, hello. - Hello, Coast Guard. Hello, Coast Guard. - Go on. The lord of the isles refused to give away his daughter. - Of course. He was a Scotsman. - Except on one condition: Prince Vreckan must anchor his galley... in Corryvreckan for three days and nights. What was the catch? The catch was that he thought he would be drowned. It's a terrible place. When the tide's running, whirlpools form and you can hear the roar for miles. And that's true. You can hear it from Kiloran. I bet he anchored, though. What he did was to go straight back to Norway. There, he asked the advice of the old men. They told him to take three anchor ropes, one of hemp, one of... Wait a moment... - Flax. - Flax. Thank you. One of flax. And you know well what the third rope was made of, Kiloran. Of course. The third rope was made of the hair of maidens... who are faithful to their lovers. Go on. The maidens willingly gave their tresses, and Prince Vreckan sailed for the Hebrides. The first night, the hemp rope broke. The second night, the rope of flax broke. The third rope held fast. The third night... Hello, Tobermory. Hello, Tobermory. Isle of Kiloran speaking. Isle of Kiloran speaking. Over to you. Over. Hello, Kiloran. Hello, Kiloran. Tobermory speaking. Tobermory speaking. Tobermory speaking. Miss Webster's here to talk to Sir Robert Bellinger. Stand by, please. Stand by, please. - In there, my dear. - Thank you. Hello? Robert? Joan speaking. I'm here in Tobermory. I had a very good journey. Isn't it a shame about the weather? If you want Sir Robert to answer, say, "Over to you." Over to you. Hello, my dear. Robert speaking. I'm glad to hear your voice, at any rate. We're all ready here, ready and waiting. Cartier delivered the ring, I hope. I hope you like it. I take it Hunter saw you off. Over. Of course, Robert. Everything was lovely. Is there anything the matter with your voice? Have you got a cold? Over. Oh, no, I haven't got a cold. Do I sound as if I had? Now, listen, Joan, have you got a pencil? Write down a telephone number. Are you ready? 2-3-6. 236. You got it? It's the Robinson's number. They've rented the castle. Robinson's done a lot of work for me, one way or another. He's one of the best. So's his wife. They're the only people worthwhile knowing around here. Ring them. They'll be glad to put you up. I'll be over to fetch you as soon as the gale blows out. Over. Hello, Robert. I've got the number, and I'll phone them. I'd rather stay in a hotel. You don't mind, do you? Over. Right, my treasure. Do just as you like. I say, Joan, Major Foster, MacNeil's factor is here beside me. He's waiting to talk to Mr. MacNeil. Is he there? I thought he was in the Army. Over. Hello, Robert. He's here, and he's in the Navy. Well, good-bye, Robert. I hope to see you tomorrow. Over. Cheerio, my pet. It'll be a quiet wedding. But full of surprises, I promise you. Chin up. You can always ring 236. This gale can't blow forever. Good-bye. Good-bye. Go ahead, Foster. Foster speaking. Hello, Kiloran. It's good to hear you're back, even though you're stuck in Tobermory. Is there anything you want done? Over. Hello, Foster. Tell Duncan that I expect the trout to jump and the krill to perch on the end of my gun. I've read all your reports. I'm longing to talk things over. - - Good-bye, Tobermory. Over. Good-bye, Kiloran. Good-bye, Kiloran. - How much is that? - Well, it's nine pence each, Kiloran. Thank you very much. Not can change that for you, Miss Webster. - Here you are. - I'll pay you back at the hotel. Good. She wouldn't see a pound note from one pensions day to another. People around here are very poor, I suppose. - Not poor. They just haven't got money. - It's the same thing. Oh, no, something quite different. - Any messages? - No, Mr. MacNeil. - Come on, ladies and gentlemen. - Mr. MacNeil. - Yes? - I want to ask you something. Anything. Do you mind if we sit at separate tables at lunch? - You do understand, don't you? - Of course I don't mind. We are strangers. Not even properly introduced. Yes, but you understand why I'm asking you? I think you're the most proper young lady I've ever met. I take that as a compliment. Please, God. Please let the gale drop. I must get over to the island tomorrow. You know that I must. It's blowing great guns! The wind's shifting all the time! It's gone from southwest to northwest since daylight! Where is it now? Blowing from every point of the compass at once. Ruairidh says they've got savers in the northwest. But you know all that before anybody. Poor beggar. I bet you're fed up to the gills. No, it's all right. I'm a patient man. I can wait. Now, listen, Colonel. You're going to get into trouble. Eh? Blast the waterfall! Speak up. There's a good chap. What? Big bird, my foot! It's my eagle! That's what I'm trying to tell you. They're after it with shotguns. Ignorant clods! If they touch a feather of old Torquil, I'll gore 'em! I've christened him Torquil. You don't mind, do you, chap? - He reminds me of you. - Oh, thanks. What? As to this outrageous accusation, I shall refute it! If lambs are missing, ten to one it's a fox or a wild cat! I don't know anything about that. Every village bumpkin believes the eagles carry schoolchildren with satchels on their backs. Ballocks! Anything! Absolute poppycock! Talk it over with Catriona, don't do anything rash and ring me tomorrow. Hello, Peigi. It's an awful pretty day, Kiloran. It is. Is Miss Webster about? - She's away. - Away? Where? She was away in lain's car before 8:00. She went to Erraig, then she came back here, she used the telephone and she was away in the car again. The family will be down in a moment, madam. - What's your name? - Good morning, Miss Cheril. - Who's she? Miss Webster has called to see Mrs. Robinson. - Can I offer you anything, Miss Webster? - No, thank you. - Are you Joan Webster? - Yes. You're going to marry Sir Robert Bellinger? - Yes. Do you mind? - I don't mind. He's rich, isn't he? Well, I haven't counted his money. Are you rich? No. Excuse me, madam. Can I have the afternoon off? Now, Martin, that's too bad, but I'm playing bridge. I see, madam. Then that's quite all right. What do you mean? I'd intended to spend the evening at Achnacroish myself, madam. What do you mean? Has Mrs. Crozier asked you to make a fois? No, madam. I'm invited by Mr. Campbell, Mr. Crozier's head gardener. He's giving a ceilidh. It's his diamond wedding. Diamond wedding. Fancy being married to you for 60 years. Well, if Mr. Robinson doesn't mind, I don't. We leave at 4:00. - Thank you. - That's all right, Martin. Adam, surely you told me Robert was having breakfast with us! No, my dear. I said that Robert's fiancee was coming to breakfast. - Here she is. - This is wonderful! My dear, we're going to be such friends. That man woke me up and mumbled something. I had no idea you were here. I'd have been down in a flash. What did Robert say your name was? But we'll be calling you Lady Bellinger soon. Her name's Joan Webster. Good morning, Cheril darling. You, of course, know everything. If only we'd known that you were stranded here. You brought your luggage? Have the blue guest chamber open for the future Lady Bellinger, Hooper. Well, really, I do... Oh, say no more. I'm one of Robert's oldest friends, and you're going to be his wife. Now, let's have a look at you. Oh, yes, you pass with honors. That reminds me, we need a fourth at bridge. We are going this afternoon to old Rebecca Crozier's. Do you play? - No. - Oh, this generation. Mind you, Cheril plays, but we're not quite in her class. She says we play a stingy game, don't you, Cheril? Oh, fairy stories at breakfast. Are you coming with us to see Auntie Crozier, darling? - It depends. - Now, that's too bad of you. You promised. Daddy's a witness. Well, how are you, my dears? Come in. Come in. Rebecca, darling, you look wonderful! Murdoch, you go and light the lamp. I'm sorry to have kept you all standing in the wind. Cheril. Who is this charming young lady? This is Joan Webster, who's going to marry Robert Bellinger. - Oh, I congratulate him. - How do you do? Put down your things, everybody, anywhere. Undo your own buttons. How on earth can you manage with three people in a house like Achnacroish? - Oh, I always have plenty of guests. - They give so much work. Not my guests, my dear. Torquil, these are friends of mine. They've taken Sorne. The English family Robinson. - How do you do? - This is Joan Webster. - How do you do, Miss Webster? - How do you do? - Hope you've got a good long leave. - Six more days. It's certainly far enough from the war here. Plates, Torquil. - Anything else, ma'am? - No, thank you. One, two, three, four, five, and half for the little one. Did you know, Torquil, this young lady's going to be the mistress of your house? I hope you'll be very happy there. - I'm sure I shall. - Are you the owner of Kiloran? Really? How interesting. You know, we nearly took Kiloran ourselves. We found it just a little bit too expensive. Your agent asked an enormous rent for it. I'm afraid that's the only income I ever get from Kiloran. You see, for three years' rent, I can live there myself for six. - That's highland economics. - Everybody's had tea? - Rebecca! - Yes, please. If I was to let my house, I should never live to enjoy the money I would get for it. Oh, you'll outlive us all. Achnacroish is a breeding place for Methuselahs. Look at Campbell. Gardener's giving the Ceilidh. Martin's invited. Campbell's diamond wedding. Quite a start on you, my dear. I'll catch up. I shall have to put in an appearance later on. - But bridge first. Thank you. - Yes, bridge first. Have you ever seen any highland dancing? No, never. You ought to see our Oban gathering in peacetime. Of course, it's not so big or famous as Braymar or Inverness, but it has its own quality. You came through Oban? Yes. The harbor was wonderful. And that lovely green island. Imagine it full of yachts, big and small. And there's racing and highland games all day. And at night... at night, they give a ball. You can't imagine what a wonderful sight it is. The assembly rooms are all hung with special hangings in dark red. And the women wear tiaras, those that have them. Oh, the place blazes with jewels. The men... The men are more splendid than the women. With their velvet doublets and scarlet waistcoats, Their lace, cuffs and jabots. Their buttons of gold and silver, their cairngorms. Their buckle shoes and their filibegs of every shade and color. And the pipes play, and we dance. We dance all night... till the sun shines through the curtains. Lovely. What does filibeg mean? The kilt. It really means "the little kilt" as worn nowadays. Now, what about bridge? Joan doesn't play. - Do you play, Mr. MacNeil? - Oh, I'm sorry, no. - I can't see from here. - You can see more from the ladder. Do you mind going up a little further? One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Martin, it's Scottish, not a minuet. Three pipers. They must've come over from the mainland. Oh, that was fine. Do you think you could dance the Scottish? - I think so. - Good. - I suppose we ought to go back now. - Oh, no hurry. Friends and neighbors, I ask a hundred thousand blessings on my father and mother. They're 60 years married this day. Peace and happiness be with them. The pride of the great Clan Campbell. # The Campbells are coming Hurrah, hurrah # # The Campbells are coming Hurrah, hurrah # # The Campbells are coming Hurrah, hurrah # # The Campbells are coming Hurrah, hurrah # # The Campbells are coming Hurrah, hurrah # # The Campbells are coming Hurrah, hurrah ## Speech! Speech! Come on, Mr. Campbell. Well... no, no, no, no. How about you and I going outside and having a little ceilidh on our own? A ceilidh! - I went down to Erraig this morning. - I know. - I went into Moy Castle. - Did you? - Shall I tell you what it's like inside? - Yes, please. It's just as you told me in the story. I saw the hall where MacNeil feasted... and the dungeon and the thickness of the wall. It's awful. And on the ramparts at the top, there's a stone- - With a curse written on it. - You've been inside. No, but I was young once. I had a nanny. - No! - Mm-hmm. - Anyway, I've read it. - It's a terrible strong curse. - Terrible. - Leave me alone. Now you know why a MacNeil dreads to enter the castle. No! No! No! - Careful. - Yes, yes, yes. Campbell, don't be silly. It's only you I love. - You do? - Yes. Come and get it! - Buns? - Aye. Excuse me, but is you not MacNeil of Kiloran? - Yes, and you'll be a Campbell. - John Campbell of Kiloran. I must tell my father that you're here. You'll do nothing of the sort. A MacNeil at a Campbell ceilidh. Hey! Wait a minute now! Allister. That's a fine song. "Naught Brown Maidens." Do you know it? Tune up, boys! It goes, "A Rome and a brown maiden. "A ream and a brown maiden. Row, row, row, maiden. You are the maid for me." Kiloran! Is that yourself, sir? Is this the way to treat an old friend on the day of his diamond wedding? We didn't want to intrude, Mr. Campbell. Here's length of good life to you and Mrs. Campbell. Thank you indeed, Kiloran. Intrude, is it? You and your lady must come in and meet Mrs. Campbell. - Torquil, I must go. - You can't go now. It's going to be a grand ceilidh, just grand. It's very good of you, but Kiloran knows I must get back. Kiloran knows nothing of the sort. You must see the dancing. But I saw perfectly well from here, thank you. You've seen nothing yet, milady. We've got three pipers. Three of'em, just by luck. They were ordered by the rich man on Kiloran. Just by luck, they couldn't get. It was the gale stopped them. Cheer up. They are your pipers. How do you do, Mrs. Campbell? This is Miss Webster. - Good night. - Excuse me, miss. And you, sir. May I be allowed to say that you were the best dancers at the ceilidh. Thank you, Martin. Please, please, God. You know how important it is for me to get to Kiloran. Please... let the gale drop... or let me get to the island somehow. Please. Please. - Morning, Bridie. - Hello, Kiloran. Hello, Kenny. - Good morning, Miss Webster. - Wind's backing a bit. Uh-huh. It's not blowing near so hard. Oh, yes, tomorrow we'll be crossing to Kiloran, or maybe the day after. But not today? Himself is going to Tobermory by the bus to see the dentist. - Tooth aching this morning? - No, but if he doesn't go now, there's no saying when the next gale will be. It's only then himself has the time. Saw you at the ceilidh. How old are you, Bridie? - I'll be 17. - You'll be marrying soon. When the right man comes along. - How old are you, Kenny? - Eighteen. Getting on. Not thinking of taking a wife? Oh, I'll be called up soon. But anyway, I'd have to wait another three or four years. - Or even more. - Why is that, Kenny? - It takes money to get married. - How much? Twenty pounds. Himself is asking that for half a share in the boat. Who's himself? - Ruairidh Mhor. - Father. I should have thought he would've given you a share as a wedding present, Kenny. If Kenny can buy half, he'll get the other half for nothing, right enough. - Good day to you, milady. - Good day. - Good day to you, Kiloran. - I wish it was. Oh, it will be. Yes, yes, it will be. Oh, yes, yes, indeed it will be. Yes, yes, it will be. Of course, I am not saying it is not blowing as much as it was, but it is near the end of it. Indeed, it is just like the sun, milady. It seems always biggest just before it sets. - A poet, Ruairidh, boy. - Do you think we can cross today? No, no, no, milady, no. Well, will you stand by in case it drops? I'll pay you for your time, of course. You said it might blow down. It's very important. I must get across. I'll pay you anything you ask. I will take you to Kiloran as soon as it is humanly possible, milady, and I will not be wanting extra payment for that. We'll be up at the house. And I will be in Tobermory. Fine doings indeed. That girl is so foolish. She's a woman already. - Who is it? - The islanders. Oh, stay to lunch. Rabbit. Colonel's doing it. Good. - Hello, Joan. - Hello. Hello. - Torquil. - Yes? Will you do me a very great favor? Yes. Will you help me to get to Kiloran? If I had a fair-sized boat. But I haven't even a small one. But Ruairidh would listen to you. If you asked him, he'd try to get me there. - Besides, you're wasting your whole leave. - I don't mind. Yes, you do. You love Kiloran. You haven't been there for years. I don't mind. - You won't ask him? - No. You don't understand. It's his job to take us across... his duty, if you like. If he could, he would. Can't you wait till tomorrow? I can't ask him to risk his life or yours. He's been out in a gale often enough. If a ship was in danger... It's different when people are in danger and need help. Yes, but... What? I want help desperately. Do you think it will blow out tomorrow? - I don't think so. - Do you think there will be a lull? Great news. Congratulate me, young lady. Torquil the eagle is found. His good name's cleared. It was a fox killing the lambs. A shepherd saw it. - The old boy's safe and sound. - Found. I'm off there after lunch with a lure. By gad, I hope I get him back. You coming? I'd like to. What about you? We'll be back by tea time. I think I'll stay here. Any sign of your godson, Torquil? No. But I can see something else. So that's it. There ought to be a law about trees. You know, Torquil... Pot him. Please, ma'am, I'd like to be speaking to Miss Webster. - Bridie wants to speak to you. - What is it, Bridie? It's about the boat, miss. Don't be thinking of taking it out, miss. - Himself will murder Kenny. - Nonsense. I'll look after your father. Anyway, Kenny's a man. He's taken out the boat alone many times. But never in a gale! Himself would never take it out. But it's blowing out. Your father said so. It's going down all the time. - Himself would never take it out today. - What about the money? Do you want to wait another four years to marry him? Well, I would, then, if it has to be. Some folks there are can't be waiting a day to satisfy their passions. What are you saying? Some folks there are want to drown fine young men and break poor giris' hearts... so that they can be wedded one day sooner! - You'd better get out! - I'll get out when I please. Who are you to be giving orders, you that come to this city... with your airs and graces and your heart of stone? Why should you think that our lives don't matter at all... and that yours is so important? But you don't understand. Bridie, don't cry. You think that I'm risking Kenny's life when I could stay safely here. But I'm not safe here. I'm on the brink of losing everything I ever wanted. What do you think you're doing? I'm off to take Miss Webster to Kiloran. You're off to losing Ruairidh's boat and drowning. Don't be a fool, Kenny. How much did she pay you? Twenty pounds. Now who's the fool? I'll make it up to you. Come on, boy. Give her back her dirty money. Ah, Kiloran, I can't do it. I promised. She made me promise, and that's the truth of it. - Oh, Kiloran! - Where's Miss Webster? She's in the flat. Please, Kiloran, don't let her be taking Kenny. - Go on, say something. - I will. Are you a complete fool? Well? How dare you speak to me like that? Is it not enough that you've been told that you cannot sail today? Ruairidh said it was going down. Kenny said so too. What do you expect Kenny to say? You bought him! There's no need to shout! Why, the lad has never seen £20 in his life. If you must commit suicide, why can't you do it in Manchester? Don't shout at me! You're insulting! - And stop bothering about me! - What about Kenny? - Well, what about him? - What about Bridie? What about the crew? What about their wives? What about their children? Do you think I'm standing here wasting time over you? - I'm not interested in your reasons. - Are you not? Are you interested in anything but yourself? I do know how to mind own business! That won't carry you far on this island or on Kiloran. You can have this island, and you can have Kiloran! Fine! Then you won't be in any hurry to get there. You can't think you know more about these waters than Ruairidh. Why do you think he refused to take you? Because he's stubborn? Because he wanted to go to the dentist. Oh, go ahead, then! And drown yourself! - You heard, I suppose. - They heard you in Tobermory. - Torquil. - Mm-hmm? - They'll never make it. - What do you expect me to do? Lock her in her room? She'd only jump out the window. She doesn't realize the danger. And you're the last person to stop her. I? She's running away from you! Say that again. Hold on there! Give me that case. Are you the praying type? - Sometimes. Are you? - Always. If we can stay on our course and right side up, we've got a chance. Aren't we on our course? Every mile nearer Kiloran, we're two miles nearer Scaba. - Is that dangerous? - Yes. - Why? - Corryvreckan. The whirlpool. You never finished the story about the Norwegian prince. You said that two ropes broke. What happened to the one made from the hair of faithful maidens? It held until the tide turned. Nothing is stronger than love. No, nothing. - Feeling sick? - Oh, no. No, I'm all right. Go on. But one maiden was untrue to her lover. Only one. And when that strand broke, the whole rope broke with it. Kiloran! Get down under the hood and hang on! Don't worry about that! Get under! Look out! Hang on! Ohh! My dress! Don't mess about! Bail! This is the way to bail! Engine's washed out. I've gotta take it apart. - What can I do? - Keep bailing. And pray. Keep it up. Clean that. Corryvreckan. Get the cover! Hurry up. If I can get it started before the tide turns, we've got a chance. Tide's still with us. We'll do it yet. Now! Pray! Your credit must be good in heaven. They know a good prayer when they hear one. So, you're back! Big strong man. Off and bed. There's a fire in my room, and that's where you'll sleep. My dear chap, my very dear chap, you've missed the experience of a lifetime! - Have I? - You certainly have. While you've been messing about, a new chapter has been written in the history of falconry. - Oh, you've got him back. - Ah, listen to this. He was up on the warren and came to the lure like a lamb... like a hawk, I mean. Then MacGillivray suggest a hunt for this fox that's been killing the lambs. So we went off, and, by gad, we found the fox, and by Jimmy Christmas, he caught it! - Caught it? Who? - Torquil! Torquil the hunter. Torquil the fox hunter! Stooped at the blighter as though it was a rabbit. Killed him stone dead. Here he is. God fox. £20 of his allowance. I'm gonna have the brush mounted for you, Torquil. Now what have you got to say? - Where is he? - There, over the door! Isn't he a pippin? Torquil, come on! Wah, loo-loo-loo! Tally-ho! Get onto him! You must think I'm awful. I don't think anyone's awful. Not even when I'm breaking my neck to marry a rich man? Oh, what's wrong with that? I thought you didn't care about money. Who says so? I'd swim to Oban for £10. Glasgow for 20. And what about Torquil? He'd do it for 15. Oh. But I thought that you and Rebecca Crozier and Torquil... were perfectly happy without money. What else can we do? Well, you could sell Erraig, and Rebecca could sell Achnacroish... and Torquil could sell Kiloran. Yes. But money isn't everything. Now go to sleep. Thank you. Good night, Catriona. And if you count the beams, your prayers will come true. I'm not praying tonight. Now, Torquil, onto your perch. That's it. Torquil, you greedy swine! Get... Get off! I can't do anything with my hair. I wonder what happened to my wedding dress. A mermaid will marry in it. How is Kenny this morning? Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth. He's helping Ruairidh with the boat. And who's to Kiloran? Not the colonel. He's got his eagle back. Not Kiloran. The only persons I can see... are you and three pipers. - Is the boat coming? - Yes, it's coming. I'd better go down and meet him. Always the little lady doing the right thing. I'm sorry. I can't change myself. You're all right as you are. Bye-bye, Mrs. Potts. I'm for the bus. Good-bye, Catriona, and thank you for everything. Will you do something for me? It depends. I don't care where or when, but somewhere, sometime, will you have the pipers play "A Rome and a Brown Maiden"? It might be done. Will you do something for me before I go away? It depends. I want you to kiss me. Now, Mr. Torquil, I've told you a thousand times. Once upon a time, hundreds of years ago, MacNeil of Kiloran took a beautiful wife from the mainland. But she was in love with a cousin of hers, a MacLaine who held Moy Castle. After a year and a day, when her husband was away ravaging the mainland, she escaped from Kiloran... and took refuge in Moy Castle with her lover. One black night, Kiloran came. He besieged and took the castle... and killed every soul except the two lovers. There's a deep dungeon just off the back of the great hall. It's a well with nine feet of water in it... and a rounded stone... just big enough for a man to stand upon... or drown. Kiloran stripped the two lovers, chained them together... and threw them into the dungeon. He sat in the great hall... feasting upon them while they held one another... above the water till their strength failed... and they dragged one another down. Before she died, the woman cursed Kiloran... and every future MacNeil of Kiloran... if they should ever cross the threshold of the castle. There's the curse... carved in stone on the ramparts. There to this day. It's a terrible strong curse. It goes... "This is the curse of Catriona MacLaine of Erraig. "My curse on MacNeil of Kiloran... "and every MacNeil after him. "If he shall ever cross the threshold of Moy, never shall he leave it a free man. " - Hi! - Hi! I was lying to you. I'd rather swim in the sea than in a swimming pool. I know. And I'd rather catch salmon in my own stream, if somebody would teach me how. I know. And I'd rather see Ruairidh Mhor not have the hell I've raised. I was lying to you too. - I'm not really afraid of this place. - I know. "Never shall he leave it a free man. "He shall be chained to a woman till the end of his days... and he shall die in his chains. " # I know where I'm going # # And I know who's going with me # # I know who I love # # But the day knows who I'll marry # # I have stockings of silk # # Shoes of fine green leather # # Combs to buckle my hair # # And a ring for every finger # # Some say he's black # # But I say he's bonny # # The fairest of them all # # My handsome, winsomeJohnny # # I know where I'm going # # And I know who's going with me # # I know who I love # # But the day knows who I'll marry ##
