THIS STORY IS A WORK OF FICTION. THE NAMES OF CHARACTERS AND GROUPS IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS, WITH NO RELATION TO REAL PEOPLE. TOEI COMPANY, LTD. JAPAN'S DON SPRING, 1967 Abebo is a conglomerate that has the Abebo Textiles and Abebo Trading companies at its core. Your president... he slept with my wife. Talking to you underlings isn't getting me anywhere. Get your president on the phone. W-Who are you? Shut up and get your pervert president! You want this to get out into the public? CLUB KAYO Well, after having a meal with the Union leaders, they took me to her. It was a woman called Yuka. She came on to me, and I couldn't resist… I had no idea there was a yakuza connection. I'm so ashamed. There's nothing you could have done. But we need to take care of this immediately. We'll have to pay them off, I suppose. Well, about that... yesterday, they asked for ¥3 million. But today, they've raised it to ¥5 million. That's the way it is with those people. Even by paying them ¥5 million... the matter won't be settled. We need to find a solution that won't come back to haunt us later. What should we do? NAKAJIMA GROUP The Nakajima Group Head Office stands inconspicuously between high-rise buildings near Nakanoshima, Osaka. Mr. Shimabara, this is our head. Boss, this is Mr. Shimabara. He's been the director of Abebo since the previous president's time. My name is Sakura. I hear you've been taking good care of Kataoka. Please, have a seat. My name is Zenbei Shimabara... I apologize about asking you for such a difficult favor. I hear that the man threatening you is named Uchida or something like that. Is there anything else you've learned about him? Well, it seems he's being cautious and isn't saying much. He called the president's home directly last night. We're at our wits' end. For now, I've brought ¥5 million. Please use it as you see fit. I don't need you to pay us to do this job... Other than the reimbursements for any incurred expenses. Oh, of course. With all due respect, please accept this ¥5 million as a token of our appreciation. I don't need reward money either. Mr. Shimabara. I can't accept this money from you because it makes it look like you're simply paying us off instead of the other guys. The Nakajima Group deserves a little more respect than that. Uchida is one of Kyowa Clan's leaders, and is also favored by their chairman, Gensho Bun. He lives with some woman in Shiideramachi. I see, a member of that gang? They aren't just a gang - there're about 500 of them. So they're a decent-sized yakuza organization. They've caused trouble with our branches too. This isn't much, but here, please have some food. Ah, thank you. Thanks for the food. Miss, these are soba noodles from the corner place, Sarashina, right? Their kitsune soba noodles are great. They're my favorite. Chief, you're just having plain udon noodles? He was told he has high blood pressure. You went to see the doctor for that, chief? I had to drag him there. It's because he's been eating nothing but horumon-yaki. Chief, you gotta have your horumon in moderation. What's that thing called that's bad for your body? Ah, that's right. I heard you'll get high cholesterol. Chief. About the Uchida matter we discussed earlier... Sakoda, you do it. Yes. Do it properly. Gotcha! You're a big bugger! Where the hell are you? Ken. This is Brother Kuroe. Hi. This is Ken Miyazono. He just got out of juvie during New Year's, and now he's a chef apprentice. What'd you do? I got 2 years for assault and extortion. I heard you want to get a badge. Yes! Then find these guys - the Chairman of the Kyowa Clan, and one of their leaders. - Big brother, did they cause trouble? - Yeah. These scum are defying the Nakajima Group. You go teach them a lesson, okay? Yes. This guy Uchida mainly drinks in Minami. - Do it properly, got it? - Yes. Others are looking for them too - it's a contest. - Yes! - Good. Umm, big brother... can I bring him with me? His name's Yoshio Takeda. Back home in Awajishima, he was like my younger brother. He arrived yesterday and I'm looking after him. His mother asked me to take care of him too. Yoshio, pay your respects! Well, alright. Listen up. A real yakuza doesn't snitch. Even if he gets caught. Remember that. - Darling! - What? I want a watch with diamonds. Miss. A watch with diamonds, a car, whatever you want - get him to buy it for you. Thanks to you, we now have a money-growing tree called Abebo! Buy it for me! We've found that scum, Uchida. Chairman Bun's here as well. Yes, 5 or 6 guys. Hey, they're leaving. - Thank you very much! - Come again! Shit! They're leaving. Idiot! Go after them now! Yes! Yoshio, let's go! I said, let's go! Yoshio, get a taxi. There's none here. Damn it! What the hell are ya doing?! I'm from the Sakoda Group! Uchida, I'm coming for you! Let's go! Call an ambulance! - Poor guy. - He's just a kid! Big brother... Let me go, brother. Let me go. I beg you, brother. - You! - What do you want?! What the hell?! What the hell ya think you're doing?! Do you know who you're messing with?! - Where's the chairman? - I'd rather die than tell you! Let me go! No! No! This is a settlement from President Abe. Take it and sign here. W-Who are you? That doesn't matter. Just sign! How could you? I'm going to tell my man about what you did to me! Go ahead, tell him. Stop! Bastards! Sakoda. What's the meaning of all this? What the hell did I do to you? Tell me. These fucking scum killed one of our young men. Uchida, is that true? Chairman, we had no choice. We did nothing! They started it! I need your help. They're after me. Want a drink? MIDNIGHT YAKUZA GUN BATTLE GENSHO BUN (CHAIRMAN), RAIZO UCHIDA (LEADER), ICHIRO KONISHI (YOUNG MAN) NAKAJIMA GROUP YAKUZA MEMBER CONFESSES TO AUTHORITIES REVENGE FOR BLOOD, BY BLOOD Mr. Shimabara, is this what you call "a solution that won't come back to haunt us later"? Look what you've done. The police will surely investigate the Nakajima Group. What will you do if they say something about us? No need to worry about that. Those guys won't say anything about us. You can't trust them. They're yakuza, after all. We can trust them precisely because they're yakuza. It's their way of making us indebted to them - that's how they earn a living. That means... We'll need to spend a great deal of money to pay off that debt... I see. I'm finally starting to understand how this works. Those guys did this on purpose, to jack up the price of this job. That's correct. How can you just sit there, acting so nonchalantly? Do you even know how much they would make us pay? I'm guessing at least ¥100 million. 100 million? President, this incident has made me understand - how far the Nakajima Group is willing to go to get things done. Being able to take advantage of that going forward would be worth the cost by itself. Well now, wouldn't that be too dangerous? They aren't mere extortionists causing trouble at stockholder meetings. President, we both know that the former conglomerates stand in our way of growth. Our company won't be able to grow by any ordinary means. Please, let me handle the relationship with the Nakajima Group. Here's the receipt for the settlement paid to the woman. Please look it over. Thank you. So long. Let's get going. Mr. Sakura, I want to show you this before you go. This is a handpicked list of the 100 best companies that we do business with. Okay? 70 of them are listed in the 1st or 2nd Sections of the Osaka Securities Exchange. Mr. Sakura, with these 100 companies, I think we could start something like a Nakajima Group "membership club." What do you say? We'll charge companies a 100,000 per month membership fee, amounting to 1.2 million a year. Multiply by 100 companies, and that's ¥120 million total. Leave the details to us. We simply want you to prepare an account for us to wire the membership fees. Mr. Sakura. It'll be similar to how celebrities have fan clubs. Please think about it. Large yakuza organizations are made up of a hodgepodge of different groups structured like a pyramid. Therefore, controlling and maintaining the organization is extremely difficult. In the case of the Nakajima Group, it is run by an executive committee consisting of the top 15 leaders. But it is the second-in-command, leading the executive committee, who has absolute authority and responsibility. So... it's been decided that we'll be setting up this new thing at the Head Office. Everyone, please take note. "Naniwa Institute of Politics and Economics?" What's this about? Well... From this point forward, the chief believes we should advance into the financial world. Matsueda over there will accompany the boss and become the one responsible for this research institute. I hope you all take good care of him. That's quite a promotion. Well, do a good job. Thank you. Matsueda's also got a university degree, so I'd say he's the right man for the job. Chief, the boss' attendant is an important job, doubling as both secretary and bodyguard. I'm not saying anything about Matsueda, but... It should've at least been communicated with the executive committee. Kaneda. Don't be so formal. This was a direct order from the boss. No! All due respect, chief, but I'll use this opportunity to ask something else on my mind. What the hell happened with Abebo? Don't you think you're keeping us all out of the loop? That's right. Whenever something happens, we're always prepared to lay down our lives as well... Are you all making demands to the chief? This isn't a demand. It's an opinion. You keep your mouth shut! Before making such accusations, why don't you shed some blood for a change? What'd you just say?! Stop it. Save that energy for our enemies. Over the past few years, we've had a few hiccups - from Hiroshima, to Kyushu, to Sanin. The Head Office's hands were tied too, but finally, things are falling into place. Japan is big. The war is just beginning. Sakura completely separated his family life with his daily life as head of the Nakajima Group. Toshiko, what's the matter? You seem down. No, it's nothing. Things aren't going well between Ichinomiya and Big Sis. She said his parents got scared when they found out about you. Makiko, stop it! What's the point of hiding it from him? It's the truth. And what has Ichinomiya said about this? He told me not to worry. But Father, I think his parents really have an issue with me. Ichinomiya is their only son... so his parents are especially protective. Perhaps I should go and visit the parents. It's fine, I've left it to Ichinomiya to figure out. How depressing! If it were up to me, and someone said something bad about Dad, I'd beat them up - even if it was my boyfriend's parents. Watch your mouth. But I'm really annoyed. The newspapers and police always treat Dad like a bad guy too. Stop it! Dad, can I borrow your car? Call a taxi. Sure, you can take it. Merci, papa. All she does is go out at night! It's because you spoil her. Can one of you take me to Umeda? Yes, ma'am. You, over there. Go. But don't forget that she's the boss' daughter. Yes. Higure, right? What's your first name? It's Michio. Michio Higure? What a romantic name. Michio, let's go for a drive. Take me to the wharf, okay? What do you want? We're adults! Creeps... Hey, Michio. Let's go to a hotel. Hmm? I can't hold back any longer... please? Miss, please stop. Dr. Ichinomiya, Dr. Ichinomiya, you have a visitor. Please come to the office. - Who is it? - They're over there. - Thanks. I'm Ichinomiya. My name is Sakura. I apologize for coming to you unannounced. Ah, no worries. I'm pleased to meet you. No, forgive me for not coming to greet you sooner and thanking you for taking good care of my Toshiko. Not at all. Dr. Ichinomiya, if you have the time, could I take you out for lunch? Thank you very much... But I have a surgery scheduled from 1 o'clock. There won't be enough time for me to go out. If you don't mind, how about you join me at the staff cafeteria? It's nothing fancy though. Is anyone sitting here? Please take a seat. Are you okay with the lunch set? Yes. Toshiko used to work at the pharmacy here. That's how she met him. He's very personable. It's a waste to keep him as a doctor. Oh, thank you. Let's eat. Looks delicious. It's pretty good. Thanks, but you're just being polite. No, I never give lip service. Dr. Ichinomiya. I came here today to talk about Toshiko. I hear that because of me, your parents are against you and her being together. I don't think Toshiko will be happy in that type of marriage. With all due respect, this is an issue between me and Toshiko. But I am Toshiko's father. Toshiko is my precious daughter. Mr. Sakura, Toshiko is the only one for me. My heart's set on her. As long as we make a happy home together... I believe my parents will be happy for us. I'm a man too. I'll never betray you or Toshiko. Please have faith in me. President, forgive me for dropping in suddenly. This is Toshiko, my daughter. My name is Toshiko. I'm pleased to meet you. My name's Abe. Please, have a seat. - This is my wife, Mitsu. - What a pretty young lady. My daughter here will soon be married to a doctor named Ichinomiya. And I was wondering if I could ask you and your wife to oversee the wedding. Well, of course. Since she's your daughter, I'll be happy to take on that role. Mitsu, why don't you show the young lady around the garden? Very well. Toshiko, shall we? It seems like there's more to this than you're letting on. President, the truth is... That girl is Sakura's daughter. Sakura? Yes, Sakura asked if I could stand-in as her parent. It seems the guy's parents showed their disapproval of the marriage because she's the daughter of a yakuza. That's understandable. Any normal parent would think twice. Well, Sakura says that he doesn't mind if he can't be at the wedding. When it comes to his own daughter, he's more timid than the average parent. Well, how selfish of him. He's the type that doesn't hesitate to commit murder. Yet he wants to see his daughter marry a decent man? Well, president, Toshiko was a war orphan... And was adopted by Sakura and his wife. That girl? He has a younger daughter as well. That daughter was brought to Sakura by an anonymous drifter when she was a child. A drifter... like in yakuza movies? Both his daughters had unfortunate beginnings. In order to raise the two girls, Tatsumi said that Sakura and his wife chose not to have their own children. Michio, promise that you'll never try to break up with me again. Miss, I don't know what to do. - Miss... - Why? I'm just a girl. My dad has nothing to do with me. I'm just a girl! Miss, will you... d-die with me? I will, I will die with you! I don't care if I die as long as I'm with you! When the rain falls in the evening GIFU, AUTUMN 1967 My heart is soaked too I feel even lonelier YANAGASE SHOPPING STREET Because I'm all alone Even if I curse him For his cruel behavior That man Will never return Don't overdo it. You'll get a fever. I don't care if I do. You're really good at this, aren't you? My first man was a tattooist. Are the Dharma names on your back for his children? No, I don't know who the father was. I aborted two babies, so I had both their names tattooed on me. Maybe I should also get a Dharma name tattooed on me. Whose? My big brother's. That fool. He tried to act brave... Hello, baby I'm also a fool Oh, here, please take this. GIFU, MIURA GROUP OFFICE This is the authorization letter from Shimabara, director of Abebo, and Morimoto, president of Ogaki Kenshi. Since the fall of last year, Ogaki Kenshi has been on the brink of bankruptcy. So, we've started restructuring the company, on the condition of a merger. 3 years ago, we were having trouble making ends meet, so we borrowed ¥10 million from Miura Trading in Gifu, at a 10% interest rate per month. The following year, we still couldn't get our finances straight, so I negotiated with them, and they agreed to postpone the repayment for 2 years if I wrote a promissory note. But, they demanded that I write a promissory note of ¥300 million, which is four times the legal amount. And when is the payment due? This November 30th. It's a promissory note from the Bank of Nagoya. If we cannot pay the full amount, it is likely that they will demand to take over Ogaki's factory. So, we were wondering if you'd be able to buy back the promissory note... Mr. Tatsumi... And we've prepared ¥100 million for it. Then, how much are you going to pay to buy it out? Well, let's see. How about ¥10 million? - ¥10 million? - Yes. You're joking, right? We're talking about a promissory note of ¥300 million. But you do understand - if they can't pay it, it's as good as scrap paper. And if this negotiation doesn't go well, Abebo says they'll pull out of the Ogaki Kenshi restructuring. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. Leave. Ah, but Miura... how should I put this? Sometimes, you have to lose to win again. Can we both make a compromise this time? Enough already! ¥10 million would only get us back the principal. I'll tell you something. The Nakajima Group has no influence east of Osaka. Leave now before you get hurt! I still think you'd be better off - even if you only get back the principal. Drop it! You startled me... I see. Well, in that case... Just remember that I warned you. THE ICHINOMIYA-SHIMABARA FAMILY WEDDING RECEPTION Toshiko. You look beautiful. Father. Mother. Thank you for everything... Up to now. This is supposed to be a celebration. I don't want you to cry. That's right, Big Sis. You'll ruin your make-up. Thank you. Place your bets. Please place your bets. GIFU, MIURA GROUP GAMBLING DEN Come on. Please hurry up, sir. - Please. - Please. 50. Sir... if you keep placing bets like that, we'll have a problem. Could you make up the difference? Oh, okay. In that case, why don't I bet this coat of arms? Sir, you need to stop joking around. If you don't have money, we can write up an IOU. - Who the fuck are you? - Me? I'm Ryutaro Ueki, a junior of the Miura Group. A junior, huh? A Miura Group junior is calling Nakajima Group's coat of arms a joke? Hey! Are you looking for a fight? Shut up, scum. I don't give a fuck about who you're with. We're the Miura Group of Gifu. Don't even think about fucking with us! - You hick! - What the fuck did you say?! Get him! Congressman Ono, thank you for coming all this way. Mr. Sakura, congratulations. I heard the groom is a fine man. I'm happy for you. Mr. Sakura, your hard work has paid off. Isn't that Deputy Leader Ono of the Democratic Party? Yes, it looks like it. And the guy next to him must be the Vice Minister of Transportation, Naramoto. Are they all acquainted with Mr. Sakura? Well, yes... Congressman Oyama. Thank you for coming all this way. I didn't think you'd make it. Well, since your name wasn't on the invitation, I didn't pay it much mind. Then I heard about the situation and rushed over. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Congratulations to you too, Mrs. Sakura. It must be difficult sending off your precious daughter like this. It's no easy feat. - I admire you for that. - I am honored by your kind words. Help! Help me... Leave! I'll kill this broad if you guys don't leave! Son of a bitch! Tatsumi speaking. One of Miyanoura's young men got killed by Miura Group's yobs. Happened a few moments ago. The Head Office received an inquiry from the Gifu Police too. What do you say? It's a little earlier than planned, but should we let the battle begin? Alright. Do it. Allow me to make a toast. Cheers. Cheers. Hey! Go get all the young men! Yes, sir! Is that right? Understood. 5 million would be enough, yes? Alright. I'll have it delivered to Sakoda's place right away. At last, the Nakajima Group is expanding east. I heard Mr. Sakura's daughter and her husband are going to Hawaii for their honeymoon. - Yes... - Miss. How much funeral offering shall we give to Himeji's Imagawa? ¥100,000 should be enough, right, honey? Yeah. Hawaii must be nice. The land of everlasting summer, the island of passion - perfect for a honeymoon! Miss, where did you go for your honeymoon? I wish I went on a honeymoon! I didn't have a wedding ceremony either. - Really? - We got together. That's it. We didn't even have any proper clothing to wear. Kiyo, how about we go for a walk? A walk? Maybe have dinner at a hotel restaurant and then watch a movie. - You and I? - Who else would it be? This must be another one of your jokes. Honey, what's wrong with you tonight? Miss, don't say such things. Sometimes you should go on dates with the chief. - I'll finish up here. - Stop teasing me. How could I be in the mood for a date when we're in the red like this? Baseball season's almost done too, right? I'll try and bridge the gap with cycle racing. - Please do. - Yes. Hey. No horumon-yaki, alright? Yeah, I know... Oh, big brother. What a surprise. What is it? Sorry to disturb you at this hour. What's the matter? I got word from Murata that he saw the boss' daughter and Higure coming out of a hotel in Sannomiya. Look what you've done. I'm truly sorry! I'm ready to face any consequences. You idiot! You're not some small-time yakuza. Take responsibility for this on your own! Ah, big brother. What's done is done. Let's have a little chat, shall we? Big brother, I won't lie. I had no intention whatsoever of sleeping with her. It's true, please believe me. She forced me against my will. Big brother! Big brother! You know it too, right? That girl's so promiscuous. She told me she'd kill herself if I didn't comply. There was nothing I could do! Big brother! I won't ever see her again... I beg you. Please forgive me, big brother... Big brother, wait! Big brother! GIFU RAILWAY HOTEL Who is it? Hi, I've come to talk about our business. Who are you? Is Mr. Miura there? Don't open the door! Get out! Or I'll shoot... Old man. That's no way to greet someone, is it? We came all this way just for you. Miura, thanks for the other day. I thought I'd drop by again. Regarding the promissory note from the other day... We've offered ¥10 million plus the life of one of our young men. Now, why don't you hand over the promissory note? You guys are just going to kill me once you take the promissory note. I know how you lot operate. I won't give you the promissory note! I'll never give it up! Help! You piece of shit! Please make them stop. I'm begging you. Miura, that man's Tsunekichi Sakoda. He won't hesitate to shoot if he needs to. The promissory note is in a safety deposit box at the Nagara branch of the Bank of Nagoya. You better not be lying, old man! It's the truth. Sir Yamashita... Thank you. Oh, welcome! Thank you. Hey, you. Let me escape from the emergency exit... I'm being chased by bad guys. - Is everything okay? - Quick, let me out. My life's in danger. Shall I call the police? Please. Really? That's good to hear! You did well! KINJO CLAN ATSUTA BRANCH No, west is risky. Head east. I'm planning to meet Kinjo Clan's Masui in Atami too. Masae, is that you? Come to Tokoen in Atami, alright? No way! We don't know what they'll do to you if you stay there. Miura, the chairman was impressed by you. He said you have nerves of steel. I can't believe how well you handled the situation, given the kind of people they are. I deal with sly foxes every day, so compared to that, the Nakajima Group was no big deal. What would be Tatsumi's next move? An unpaid promissory note wouldn't look good to Abebo, would it? Perhaps Tatsumi's going to hand over his own neck instead of the ¥300 million. Well then, brother. I'm leaving first thing in the morning tomorrow. You can stay here for a while. I'll leave these guys behind, just in case. I appreciate it. Thanks for all your help. - Well, let's call it a night. - Good night. Good night. Masae... Sorry for being late. I guess you fell asleep. Hey... listen. Wake up. Daddy's home! Darling... Masae... Who?! What happened, brother?! This bizarre case caught the attention of the public, and the police investigated the case as a personal grudge or perverted act, but they never found a suspect. In the new year, Ryutaro Ueki was chosen as the successor of the Miura Group. The ¥300 million promissory note that had been safely resting in the bank safe until then was handed over to Kataoka of the Nakajima Group, in exchange for ¥10 million in cash. 1968 That year, the Nakajima Group expanded with tremendous momentum from the Kinki region to the east. Sakoda and his squad fought at the frontlines, carrying out raids for the Nakajima Group. But they faced strong resistance from the Kinjo clan-related groups in the Chubu and Kanto regions. Therefore, Nakajima Group's area of influence stretched north along the Sea of Japan, and consequently, Eastern Japan was split in two between them and the Kinjo Clan. Alright, place your bets. Both Ato and Saki. Same here. EARLY SPRING, 1969 Saki. Any more for Ato? Ato. Here's one for Ato. People of Echigo Takada! It's my great pleasure to introduce Bansui Ono, the candidate for the House of Representatives! This is Deputy Leader Bansui Ono of the Democratic Party! ECHIGO TAKADA Thank you for the warm welcome! This is Bansui Ono. Thank you for your support! This isn't enough. I'll bring the rest this evening. Politics for the people. Building a world for the people. This is your Japan Cooperative Party candidate for the House of Representatives. It's not much, but please accept it as a donation to your campaign. Well, well... thanks as always for your help. How are things, Congressman Ono? Well... I'm quite optimistic because the reformists are all bark and no bite. But as the US-Japan Security Treaty review is coming up next year, we must have an absolute majority. I hope you'll seize the Prime Minister's seat this time. The Prime Minister's seat must be really comfortable to sit on, since no one wants to give it up that easily, huh? Rather than that, Mr. Sakura, I'm eagerly hoping to see you reach the top of the yakuza world. In order to do that, perhaps you need to change your tactics and look to politics instead of violent fighting. For example, you could run as a candidate in the next House of Councilors election. Me? Yes, you. If you run in any national constituency, you'll certainly be elected. Don't you agree, Tatsumi? I'm not very good at understanding these things... You're going to have to do better than that. You guys need to become a little more cognizant of the current state of affairs. The truth is, the Metropolitan Police Department is starting to get quite concerned about your group's activities. It's gotten to where I'm not sure if I can hold them back, even with my power. Congressman Ono and Boss Sakura are both from our prefecture. And now, they are both important men, or rather, great heroes who carry the fate of Japan on their shoulders. Their relationship is reminiscent of the one between Katsu Kaishu and Chuji Kunisada at the end of the Edo era. It's not Chujii, it's Jirocho Shimizu! Both men made their way out of poverty... Chief, one for good health? Thank you very much. I, Fujio Nozaki, am so honored to have you and the chief come out to such a remote countryside like this. We're counting on you. You're vital to the Nakajima Group in the Hokuriku region. Of course. I'll devote my life. Let me offer you a drink in return. Oh, it's you. I have to see my missus - let me through. Your wife is working right now. "Work," you say? I have to get the money from her to pay you guys back! We'll forget about your debt, so go home, get out of here. - You idiot! - Hey! Bastards! Who the fuck are you making her sleep with?! You asshole! Get up! When did I say you could prostitute my wife?! Alright, I'll tell you who she's sleeping with. She's with Shuhei Tatsumi of the Nakajima Group. Still want to get your wife back? Get out of my sight! - Take a look at these, will you? - What's this? Oh, they're building plans. Ichinomiya Hospital? I thought it might be time for you to open your own practice. It's still only a blueprint, but the site is near my office. I was shocked. It was quite sudden. There's a reason he did that. The boss heard that you were in a difficult position at the university. You were supposed to become an associate professor this spring, right? - Did Toshiko tell him? - No, not her. The boss has been looking out for you from the moment you met him. I see... How's everything at the university? Well, after I married Toshiko, my seniors started treating me differently. At a faculty meeting, one of the professors said I should be let go, otherwise there'd be an increase in yakuza patients, and it'd hurt the university's integrity. That's awful. He's usually more understanding. But when you enter a competitive environment like a university, you become a demon and try to eliminate anyone who gets in the way. But isn't that how society is in general? A father can be a good-natured man at home, yet do things for a company that are borderline criminal if it means eliminating the competition. That's also a kind of violence. I guess when men get swallowed up by organizations, they can become savages. Hey! Isn't that Makiko? I've heard she hasn't been home in a while. Murata! It's marijuana. A type of cannabis imported from Vietnam. Miss, let's go home. Maki, your mother's worried. No... Miss. Hey, you... what the fuck are you doing to my girl? It's nothing to do with you. Stay out of it. What the fuck did you say?! You want trouble?! You! You called my mom, didn't you? She said she'll return home shortly. Wait! I have something I want to ask you. What is it? You killed Michio, didn't you? What are you saying? The other day you said he went back home. But really, you killed him because my dad told you, right? Miss... You mustn't say such silly things. Matsueda, sleep with me. If you don't, I'll tell the police you killed Michio. That's fine. Tell the police whatever you like. But you should also have a bit more decency. Think about your parents. I'm absolutely fine. I'm asking you to sleep with me because I like you. What's wrong with that? Miss. Something's wrong with you. TOKYO P HOTEL That's Kinjo Clan's boss, Iwami. Well, then. Mr. Sakura, thank you for coming all this way for us. - Not at all. Congratulations. - Thank you very much. At last we've achieved our long-time goal of expanding to the capital, and we've finally joined the ranks of the first-class companies. Please, enjoy. What was that? He's so full of himself. I wonder how he'd react if we exposed that incident with the girl? Mr. Sakura. Hello, Mr. Oyama. Thank you for the other day. Don't mention it. Congratulations on your recent tremendous success. This is a celebration for you too. Mr. Sakura, let me introduce you to Kinjo Clan's Eizou Iwami. Iwami, this is Mr. Sakura of the Nakajima Group. Iwami. A pleasure to meet you. It's nice to meet you. I've heard many things about you from my predecessors and I've long hoped to meet you one day. I look forward to working with you in the future. Likewise. Mr. Sakura, I'd like to see you after the party. - Do you mind? - No. Iwami. Is that alright, chief? I'd now like to take some time to hear the congratulatory addresses from our guests. First, please welcome Congressman Kikuo Oyama. Mr. Sakura, I'm thinking about leveraging both your influence and Iwami's, to create something called the Japanese Allies Association. With the US-Japan Security Treaty review looming next year, the left-wing bunch are planning to use that opportunity to turn Japan into a socialist country. As men who are concerned about the future of Japan, yakuza and patriots should join forces to create the Japanese Allies Association. United together, we'll demand action from the Conservative Party, to protect Japan from communist ideologies. I'm sure you're aware by now, but ever since that elite bureaucrat Naitou became Prime Minister, the yakuza's relationship with party members like Ono and Tagawa has more frequently been taken up in the news. This is the elite bureaucrats' attempt at tainting the party's image. It's also a sign that they'll ride the wave of public opinion and start coming after the yakuza. It goes without saying that their first target will be the Nakajima Group. So here's my idea... If you change your group into a political organization, you can weather these attacks from the judiciary. You'll help me, right? Well, I appreciate the invitation, but I'm just a man who makes a living by doing what I like. Stop. Don't overthink it. I just need you to show me the yakuza spirit - that you're willing to help in the face of this national crisis. With all due respect... right now, my hands are full trying to feed my crew of 10,000 members. Therefore, I'll have to pass on this offer. Yakuza nowadays... they all try to show off by working with politicians and what not. It's laughable. That's true. I'm glad our boss didn't take the offer. He's different from the rest. When his daughter got married, I was worried he'd abandon the life of a yakuza, but I guess I was mistaken. Hey, Umehara. Let's go out for a drink. Sure. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight anyway. Let's go. Who's that? Yes, Tatsumi speaking. Thanks for the other day. Can I bring Umehara with me? Alright. We'll be over right away. What was that about? We got invited to a dinner party at Akasaka. They're having yuba tofu. I asked to meet with you today because Congressman Taguchi needs your help. Tatsumi. This is a huge job. So listen carefully. Have a look at this. Sanzen Oil is planning to build an oil refinery in Yokohama’s Sugita District. Abebo Development and Abebo Land are trying to single-handedly undertake 2.8 million square meters of land acquisition and landfill, as well as negotiations of compensation for 1,300 fishermen. Abebo's doing the work for Sanzen? The financial world's a mystery, isn't it? Sanzen is trying to compete with companies like Sumii and Marui. With this opportunity, they're trying to bring Abebo to their side and gain the upper hand. I've known this information for some time now, and I was conducting an investigation in secret. You'll find some shocking information about fraud and conspiracy in this document! And... I thought I'd pass this on to you and Iwami. In other words, you're telling us to betray Abebo? Abebo isn't being loyal either. They even asked Iwami to become their consultant. That must just be for formality's sake. You fool. Don't be so naive. Abebo is saying that they don't care if they cut ties with the Nakajima Group. Impossible. The financial world is a hive of corruption. I understand what you're saying... I'd like to know how you really feel about this, Iwami. Work is work. Thanks for the offer, but I won't be able to accept it. Why not? As for us, we have no intention of betraying Abebo. You and Sakura - it seems like people from the west aren't very flexible. We're just simple people. We get it from the boss. All Nakajima Group members are the same. If that's case, we'll let it go. However, from now on, the Kinjo Clan will be overseeing Abebo in the Kanto region. Mark my words. We'll continue to protect Abebo, whether it's in Kansai or Kanto. Abebo's also expecting the same. No, you're wrong about that. We received a formal request from Abebo. I haven't heard about anything like that. Well, you've heard it now. Indeed. I'll be sure to make note of it. Well, thanks for your hospitality. Let's get going. Excuse us. What a fucking bastard. Iwami, don't let your guard down. Tatsumi's been boasting since the post-war days, that he'd make Sakura the number one boss in Japan. Then why don't we get rid of him now? Doing such a thing would ruin Kanto's reputation. Don't worry, I won't let any of these Kansai bastards set even one foot on Kanto soil. CHIVALRY WINTER, 1970 In the world of the yakuza, a ceremony is held on December 13th to begin preparations for the New Year. It is customary for all leaders to assemble at this ceremony and conduct the yearly review. That year, the Nakajima Group consisted of 50 leaders under the second-in-command, Shuhei Tatsumi, and more than 12,000 members. Congratulations, boss. Congratulations. Congratulations. You've done well for us this past year. Continue doing your best in the new year as well. Yes, sir! This is the president of Sanzen Oil, President Wachi. Wachi. Pleasure to meet you. Tatsumi. Seiji Kataoka. I've worked with Abebo for quite a while now. I look forward to continuing this partnership. Mr. Tatsumi. Sanzen Oil and we, Abebo, are being blackmailed by a certain person. Oil refineries are the main cause of pollution! Listen, Mr. President. Even if I did receive the ¥500 million from you, I'm not trying to misappropriate! I'm trying to use it for the welfare of the people suffering from pollution! Regarding the problem with pollution, these days each company is taking their own measures to combat it. In terms of compensation for local residents... Shut up, shut up, shut up! You may've been able to cheat the poor with smoke and mirrors, but I won't be fooled! Listen, if you're not willing to pay me out, then I'll expose everything the scoundrels at Abebo have done over the past 3 years to construct the oil refinery! I'll bring everything to light at the National Diet! Look at this. From construction permits to land acquisitions, landfill, compensation for local residents... How many billions have been handed out to corrupt politicians and officials to complete everything?! I have proof of everything, down to every single detail! OSAKA R HOTEL I'm sorry for being late. I've come to pick up Congressman Taguchi. Do you work for the city of Osaka? Yes, I'm Hatakeyama, the general affairs section manager. A section manager?! How rude! Tell your director to come! Unfortunately, the director and department head are both on a business trip. What?! On a business trip?! Does the city not care about foreign businesses?! Good grief, local governments are really slacking off these days! My apologies! So, where are you planning to take me to? First, we'll have dinner at Tsuruya. After that, we'd like to show you around Kita. Geisha? Or gambling? Whatever you're interested in. I see. Just the other day, Congressman Fukunaga and I... - Yes? - We went to Korea together. So I don't want a Korean girl, okay? Yes, yes, I understand. I'll be waiting at the entrance. Hello, this is Congressman Taguchi's secretary. Please wait a moment. - Sir, it's a call from Abebo's secretary. - What do they want? They're saying they would like to talk to you directly... It's a young lady. A lady? What do you want now? I'm not accepting any postponements. I don't care what your idiot president says. I'm coming to get the money tomorrow, you got that? It's not about that. The director instructed me to show you around the Osakan night life. I'm at the entrance now. Alright... are you alone? Yes. - Are you Congressman Taguchi? - Yes. That's me. My name is Kyoko Koyama. I'll be your companion for tonight. Shall we? Sir, the car is ready for you. Idiot, I've no business with a worthless low-ranking official like you. Get out! Oh, um... Bastards, who the fuck are you?! Do you know who I am? I'm a member of the National Diet! Congressman Taguchi. Will you sign this for us? What is that? - Read it to him. - Yes. "I have reflected deeply" "on my past actions" "and swear that I will never coerce people to provide money or goods for me again." "To the attention of Abebo Co. Ltd., Sanzen Oil Co. Ltd.," "and the Naniwa Institute of Politics and Economics." Alright, I get it now. You lot are Abebo's muscle! Don't underestimate me, punks! I won't surrender to such threats! - Well, well... - What the hell are ya doing?! You'll see, come on! Alright! What are ya doing?! Who do ya think I am?! I'm a member of the National Diet! Stop it! It's dangerous! Stop it! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Please, stop it! Help me! Please, please! There we go! Sir... please. Sit up! No! I won't sign! I won't give in... I won't surrender to violence! What did you say?! Wanna go again? Go! Please stop! Stop, please! Please stop, please stop! Go! Tatsumi, it was you, bastard! Don't you dare! How dare you insult me, a congressman?! I won't stay quiet about this. This is a clear challenge by the yakuza to the National Diet! You've just started a war between the Japanese government and the Nakajima Group! You idiot! It's a disgrace to have the name of our country coming out of your filthy mouth. What the hell? I won't let this slide! I'll have you prosecuted in the National Diet! Do whatever you like. But remember, from that day onward, 10,000 Nakajima Group members will be after your neck. Be ready for that. AGAINST CORPORATE CONSTRUCTION YOKOHAMA CONSTRUCTION UNION DEATH TO THOSE WHO STEAL FISHERMEN'S LIVELIHOODS! SUGITA LOCAL FISHING INDUSTRY UNION GET RID OF THE NUISANCES SUGITA NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION Hey. Good morning. I've heard that the landfill in Yokohama has begun. Yes. We were given a contract to transport the dirt and sand. Since it's a big project that'll take 3 years to complete, I'm thinking of letting the teams take turns with the contract. What about Kinjo Clan's movements? No one's paying them any mind. They must've gathered after hearing about what you said to Oyama. KANEDA TRANSPORT Watch out! Be careful! Get out of here! The woman with long hair smokes a cigarette And blows out blue smoke like the devil Every time the worn-out door opens She mumbles With misty eyes And a glass in her hand Where were you all at ten this evening? We were here the whole time. Hey, old man, if it's about drugs, we've quit... Hey, what are you doing? What's this about? What's the matter? Did something happen? Some punks attacked Kaneda Transport. Hey! What does that have to do with us? At any rate, we're gonna need you to come with us to the station. Officer! What's the matter?! Kaori, what's the matter?! Honey, it hurts! - Oh no, I think she's in labor! - You're in labor?! - Are you okay? - She's in labor! Hey! You have a patrol car, right? Officer! Lend us the patrol car! - Idiot, I'll get in trouble for doing that! - Please let us use it! What do you mean you'll get in trouble? What'll you do if the kid dies?! Officer! I'll report you to the papers as the demon cop! Alright, I got it. Hey, let's take her. Hey, be gentle with her! Outta the way! My baby's gonna be born! Move outta the way! My baby's gonna be born! Please! Quick, carry her gently! Be careful! Kaori, are you okay?! Stay strong! Move aside. Quickly, outta the way. Alright! Let's go! Hey, you guys, don't go causing any trouble. We've already got our hands full with boisterous students this year. God dammit. What's the meaning of this? Mr. Tatsumi, regarding the construction site in Yokohama... We'd like to cancel the contract we had for dirt and sand transportation. What do you mean? What's the reason? There isn't really a specific reason, but we've realized that things in the east must be handled with the east. Otherwise, there will be disputes, like we saw the other day. I hope you understand the situation we are in as well. Shimabara. Are you being coerced into this by the Kinjo Clan? Are you thinking about dumping the Nakajima Group for the Kinjo Clan? Not at all. I'm saying this of my own volition. As for our relationship, we hope we can continue as we did before. Mr. Tatsumi, I hope you accept this. No, I cannot. Unlike how it is in your world, in ours, if we pull out at this point and look weak, then we'll lose our way of putting food on the table. So, no. I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. Big brother... Right. That evening, around 200 Nakajima Group members set off for Yokosuka. Their preparation and departure was swift - as if they had been waiting for it to happen. What the fuck do you want this early in the morning? What's this? Apples. They're apples. Watch yourself. What do you want? We're just trying to get to work! You trying to get us fired? We're all just colleagues. Good luck finding whatever you're looking for. Be careful, it's heavy. - Is that everything? - Yes. The Nakajima Group is getting serious. Sakoda's underling, Munakata, marched into Yokosuka with his 200 men. Tatsumi's declaring war on us. And I'm ready for it too. No! Don't do that, Iwami. Not at this critical juncture. Stupid disputes will be the cause of Japan's downfall. Iwami, you mustn't. Why don't you just talk to them and figure it out? These bastards aren't smart enough to see the bigger picture. I'm going to fight this out until I see Issei Sakura surrendering to you. ICHINOMIYA HOSPITAL Everything looks good. You're in great shape. How's Tatsumi doing? I'm concerned he hasn't come in for a check-up lately. After all, heart disease is like having a ticking time bomb. Excuse me, miss. I just got a call from Kita Police. They have Makiko in custody. We had to take her in, since she was severely intoxicated last night. She was screaming and crying out, "I'm the daughter of Nakajima Group's leader!" I sincerely apologize for the trouble. Makiko! Listen, marijuana's a drug too. You'll ruin yourself if you don't stop. Got it? Besides, the next time you're caught, you'll have to go to prison. Makiko. Apologize to the detective. For what? They can't even catch my dad! Makiko! - Miss! - Let me go! Makiko, that's enough! Mom, I'm not going home! I'm not your real child anyway! Miss Sakura! Stop it! Get outta the way! Ouch, what are you doing?! Give it back! - Hey! - Hey! - What did you just do?! - Stop it! It's their fault! They aren't allowed pictures without permission! Makiko! TERRIFYING YAKUZA FAMILY DAUGHTER OF NAKAJIMA GROUP ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA POSSESSION Yes, on charges of tax evasion. That's right. It's a raid on the Naniwa Institute of Politics and Economics. Yes. It's probably just the cops harassing us. Yes. Alright, I understand. In any case, we have to deal with it. Go to Tokyo with Umehara as soon as you can. Okay. ONO BANSUI ONO RESIDENCE, TOKYO Chief! We were told that Congressman Ono just had a stroke. He's in critical condition. Upon receiving news of Bansui Ono's critical condition, Sakura was suddenly admitted to a private room on the 4th floor of the Ichinomiya Hospital, where he was ordered to bed rest due to high blood pressure. Tatsumi was appointed the interim acting head. I know it's not the most convenient, but please stay here for now. How is it in Yokosuka? It's calmed down considerably. Tatsumi, don't underestimate Tokyo. I know, boss. Just watch. We'll crush Yokosuka before long. No, eventually you'll encounter a problem you cannot solve. The current police activity is an example of that. It's just proof that the Nakajima Group is getting bigger. So it's expected for us to receive a bit of backlash. Don't push yourself. If Congressman Ono doesn't make it, I'll go to his funeral. No, you mustn't. Please, leave that to me. I can't allow my boss to head east right now. Don't be silly. Even if I die, Tatsumi, I know I have you to take over. Did the boss say anything about Oyama? Oyama or not, they're all just human. What's there to be afraid of? In any case, perhaps it's best to observe the situation for the time being? Don't be foolish. Is there such a thing as rest in a yakuza fight? Don't leave the boss' side, alright? Yes. I'll see you in a bit. If nothing's done about this, there's gonna be more of these, and there'll be no turning back! I want all members of your group to pull out... Except for those directly involved with the construction! But, officer... You haven't even done anything about the incident with the Kaneda Group. I can't help but notice that the police keep looking out for the Kanto region yakuza. Don't be foolish! This is all happening because you guys invaded another turf! Listen up. Take your crew back to Osaka by midnight! This is an order. MATSUYA INN The cops said that if we don't pull out by midnight, they'll arrest all of us. I'm fucking pissed. I don't know if many of us will make it, but I'm thinking of forcing our way through the riot squad, and raiding Kinjo Clan's Head Office in Tokyo. You can do that another time. In any case, just bring the body home for now. I have to go to Tokyo in two days because Congressman Ono passed away. Chief, don't be absurd! Why do you have to go to that funeral? Just send one of the junior leaders or someone instead. I can't do that... If I don't go, the boss will insist on going himself. We can't let him go to Tokyo now, can we? Understood. Then, I'll have Miyanoura take care of Munakata's body, and I'll stay behind. No, there's no way I'll let you come to Tokyo alone, chief. What are you doing?! - Let me get rid of it! - Stop it! You idiot! I did say I wanted a child! But what is this?! You had a black baby?! You really think I'd accept it as my own?! You idiot! Hey, Kaori... I even got congratulations from my boss and my big brother. What the hell were you thinking?! If you want to be with me, you have to kill that baby. Kill it, alright?! You idiot! What were you thinking?! Why does it matter if it's black or white? It's still a baby. Shut up! Hey, fellow. It's alright. What the fuck do you want? Besides, how are you gonna live if you get dumped by Kaori? How far are you going? Anywhere but here. I'm going to Hokkaido... do you want to come with me? I'll come with you. What is it, big brother? Tatsumi's coming to Tokyo tomorrow. Tatsumi from the Nakajima Group? Yes, that's the one. The guys in Tokyo and Yokohama are out for blood. We're not gonna just sit back and watch. You know what he looks like, right? I've seen him in the newspaper a lot. MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MR. BANSUI ONO Chief! It's that car! Get him! Don't let him get away! Chief, are you alright?! I'm fine. Hey, Harita! Stay with us! - Let's go! - Move out of the way! Tatsumi! You bastard! Chief! You fucker! You piece of shit! - Chief! - Hey! Watch out for any others! - Where's the car?! - Hurry! Chief! Get him to the doctor, now! - I'll leave the rest to you. - I understand. As for the recent series of events, we, the Kinjo Clan, have no knowledge of them. You journalists like to cook up stories. "A decisive war for supremacy," "A struggle for power..." But we don't believe in such old-fashioned heroic ideals. It seems the hitman who was arrested confessed to receiving money from a Kinjo Clan leader. Nonsense. No such thing happened. How do you plan to deal with the Nakajima Group in the future? Perhaps you can sign a peace agreement and define one another's territory? I've made a similar offer to them several times through Congressman Oyama. But it seems that they're extremely stubborn. Hey, Iwami. How dare you fire your gun at my chief. Don't miss. Don't miss the target. You bastard! Bastard, get off of me! Let me go! That crazy son of a bitch. FIRST CIVILIAN LIFE CLAIMED. WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING? CIVILIANS LIVING IN FEAR How are you doing? Oh, I've healed up well. I'm not talking about your wound. I'm talking about your heart condition. Oh, there's nothing to worry about. It's a condition I've had for a long time. About Sakoda... We'll have to expel him. Expel? Yes. Boss, isn't that a little harsh? Considering Sakoda's position and accomplishments, everyone will lose morale if we expel him now. I know what he did was wrong, but Sakoda risked his life for the Nakajima Group. Tatsumi, it's been 25 years since I took over the Nakajima Group. I'm not exaggerating when I say that we wouldn't be here today without your hard work. But now, the Nakajima Group is at an important turning point. If we are to lead 15,000 members in this day and age, then we cannot have men like Sakoda. We have to make that clear to the world. Prepare for Sakoda's expulsion immediately! Boss! That's not right! What?! 4TH CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION I haven't noticed anything at all. I just leave those things up to our director, Shimabara. But I've heard once or twice, that Shimabara was being threatened by the yakuza. I've known Mr. Kataoka of the Nakajima Group through our stockholder meetings. And that's how I've also met Mr. Sakura and Mr. Tatsumi. I was just trying to be cordial with them, but... Then, somehow, they cleverly talked us into paying a consultation fee, and I introduced them to other companies too. Consequently, I ended up playing a role in raising funds for the yakuza. And I deeply regret that. If it's about my expulsion, I already know. The detective gave me this. EXPULSION NOTICE Sakoda. I understand how you feel about it. But I have no regrets leaving a group that'd expel me - for doing what I've done. I guess when you become successful, you start to care more about appearances than how you really feel. Chief. Please take good care... Of my wife and kids. We need to make Tatsumi issue a letter of disbandment no matter what. If Tatsumi disbands his group, the Nakajima Group will collapse. For that to happen, we need an arrest warrant for Sakura as soon as possible. Hitting Sakura with an arrest warrant will surely get Tatsumi to cave. Word is that Tatsumi's heart condition has worsened after getting shot in Tokyo. Whatever shape he's in, I'm sure even he feels weak. We need to corner these guys. At all costs. You threatened Abebo's director, didn't you? They said you stole hundreds of millions from them with this receipt. Who ordered you to do this? Was it Tatsumi? Or Sakura? Cat got your tongue, punk?! Huh, you punk?! How about that? Hey, why don't you have some tea? Maybe it'll help you talk. You little shit! Take this! Roughly ¥500 million was transferred to the Naniwa Institute of Politics and Economics over the past 4 years. On paper, Shirou Matsueda's the head, but you're the one who was actually pulling the strings, right? Where'd you hide that money? I don't know what you're talking about! What did you say again? Naniwa Politics? What the fuck is that? Kataoka! Don't think we're stupid! Ouch, that hurt! This is police brutality! Ma'am. If you would just say that you received money from Kataoka, then we'll end the investigation into your husband. He'll still be charged for tax evasion, but he'll probably just have to pay a fine. But if you're going to continue to be this stubborn, we'll have to go after him for his other crimes - like extortion and inciting a murder. Ma'am. You have a daughter named Makiko, right? Well, we received a call from Hyogo, saying that she's been arrested for possession of heroin. Normally, she'd get locked up 4-5 years for that. But I can easily change that. I don't know anything. Listen, we only need 10 minutes. We just want to ask him a few questions. Absolutely not. He's on bed rest, so I won't allow that. Don't give me that! We know he's feigning illness. Outta the way! Absolutely not. Hey! This is obstruction of justice. What obstruction of justice? This is my hospital. I'll sue you both for trespassing. What'd you say?! Doc, you're even outdoing the yakuza. What's this? What do you want? Is Shuhei Tatsumi here? I'm Tatsumi. Shuhei Tatsumi. You're under arrest for insurance fraud charges. "Fraud?" Tatsumi. Frankly, I don't care about your insurance fraud. What we want is that you disband the Tatsumi Group. You've already made a name for yourself. Why not just retire and mark an honorable end to your career? Alright. Let's make a deal. Currently, we at the 4th division are working with the 2nd division to gather evidence against Sakura for tax evasion. But I'll let it slide - so long as you give a letter of disbandment. Listen. This isn't going to be simply a mere tax evasion charge. We're also charging him for extortion and for inciting murder. He'll easily get 10 years. You and Sakura will never be able to recover. You better think long and hard about it. Long and hard... Sakoda just took his life. He left a note for you. Have a look. CHIEF, I'M FED UP. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. Poor Sakoda... Sakura won't hesitate to abandon you as well - if he no longer finds you useful. The saying goes, "A general climbs to fame on the bodies of thousands of nameless soldiers." What do you say, Tatsumi? Haven't you had enough of this yakuza nonsense? Isn't it time you opened your eyes? “I, the Kataoka Group leader, Seiji Kataoka," "with respect to the good people of society..." Sakoda's death shook the Nakajima Group members to their core. And many prominent juniors of Sakura, such as Kataoka, Umehara, and Kaneda released letters of disbandment, one after another. Tatsumi. It seems like your heart condition isn't very good, so I've decided to release you on special grounds today. Also, now that we have letters from Kataoka and Kaneda, we're finally ready to request a warrant for Sakura. Here it is. ARREST WARRANT Boss. I request your permission for me to retire. I'm in such poor health... that I can't be of any use to you. And if the Tatsumi name is removed from the Nakajima Group, then perhaps, the public's perception of the group will change. You're saying you'll disband the Tatsumi Group? Yes. Tatsumi! Unlike Sakoda, I see you as one of my own! You disbanding the Tatsumi Group would mean my admission of defeat to the police and society. No... I won't surrender! Never! So long as you live, you must continue to fight alongside me. Boss. No, don't say another thing. Rest well, and take care of yourself, alright? Yes... You idiot! How could you allow Tatsumi to get so weak? - Make him well! - Yes. I've prepared a room for you on the 3rd floor. Let's head there first. Kiyo, let's go home. - Chief! - Honey! I'm fine. I can walk on my own. Chief! Honey! Tatsumi's growing weak, both in the heart and body. Keep an eye on him. Doctor! Isn't there anything you can do? Let's give him a shot of morphine. Hurry! Tanimoto... hey! Call the 4th Division's chief. Tell him to come tomorrow morning - I'll be releasing a letter of disbandment. Do it now. Brother, please. Don't go through with this. You'll be tarnishing your own name by doing so. Kiyo, bring me something to write on. - A pencil too. - You cannot do that. Please, get some rest. Hey! I was just told that Tatsumi's going to release a letter of disbandment. Really? I've given you a lot of grief. Oh, what are you saying? I'm just happy that you're finally doing this. To tell you the truth, I was getting fed up with them. You sacrificed so much and gave the group your all. And yet everyone's being so selfish now. Even the boss - does he know of all the hardships you endured? Thankfully, it's all over now. Let's just forget about everything and live together peacefully. Right? Yes. Kiyo. Bring me a pencil and paper. Honey. Bring it now. Disbandment, right? "Dis..." Honey? Honey? Oh no... Honey... Kiyo... give me a hand. I can't die without writing this... What are you saying? Stop it, please! Help me hold myself up. Stop it! How many years have we been together, dear?! - Stop it! - Kiyo! "Pledge..." "I..." "I..." "Tatsumi..." "Shuhei... " "Am..." Honey! Kiyo, I don't know how to write the kanji character... "On this occasion..." What's the kanji character for occasion? The character... "This occasion..." Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! I have to write this. "Disbandment..." - Doctor, please help him! - Have him lie down on his stomach. Brother, let's get you on the bed. It's fine, stop it. Brother, come on... Leave me alone! Give me his hand. Honey? Honey! Honey! Tatsumi just passed away. I'm sure it was hard on you. No one will be able to hurt you anymore. I'm Fukushima from Osaka Police HQ. We want to see Tatsumi. Mr. Tatsumi... Has passed away. - What? - Are you making stuff up again?! Where's Tatsumi's room? Tell us now! It's on the 3rd floor. Chief! Hey! Wait, hey! When did he pass away? - At 4 this morning. - What was the cause of death? Please ask Dr. Ichinomiya. - Is there a letter of disbandment? - There's nothing of the sort. What was the cause of death? Tell me! Sir... Just know that I'm a member of the Sakura family. You did well. THE END
