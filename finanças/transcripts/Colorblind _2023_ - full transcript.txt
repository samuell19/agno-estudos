[soft piano music plays] [music fades] [Magdalene] Monet. Monet! Hey. [grunts] Can you watch these boxes while I get the other ones up? What if someone tries to take something? [Magdalene] You just ask them politely to freeze, while you're sketching for the police. [she chuckles] [she coughs] [door creaks shut] [she coughs] Can you help your mama out, please? Mom, I'm painting. Is that how you gonna be the man of the house? Mom, why can't you have more sons, so we can take turns being the man? It's exhausting. Yeah, I'm exhausted already. [chuckles] [sighs] I wish you don't ever have to grow up to be a man in this world. Especially a Black man. Sorry, babe, let me just put that there for a sec. Are these my toys? Hey, be careful. Those are fragile, okay? -[box crashes on floor] -Monet! Jesus, not this one. [Monet] Sorry. You know, your dad got this for me as a wedding gift. If you look on the bright side, now it's gonna remind you more of Dad when you look at it. Your tongue is a good enough reminder. [he chuckles] Mom, why everything looks different here? [Magdalene] What do you mean, baby? The homes, the people, the streets. Everything is much brighter. It's not like back home. Yeah, it's different, but... you'll have a brighter future. And you'll go to a different school and see brighter looking kids. Do you know what? I bet you shine brighter than all of them. [she chuckles] What if they don't like me, 'cause we don't look alike? Hey, what do I always tell you? You can only see the true color of a diamond through a shining light. There's a... There's a rainbow in everyone if we just look beyond our deceiving sight. Right. [chuckles] All right, let me see your masterpiece. I think that girl across the street could see my rainbow. Stay here. I'll be right back, okay? I'm scared of cops. Baby, hey. They smell fear, remember? What you gonna be, a lion or a lamb? A lion. That's my boy. I'll be right back. [door clicks open] [door clicks shut] Hey, officer. Everything okay? Are these your items? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I just moved here. Anything wrong, officer... Clinton? Well, you know, you're blocking the public path. [Officer Clinton] May I check your ID? It's my hair. I-- I used to straighten it back then. You know, my mom used to say a Black woman should never ever straighten her hair. You ever see a lion playing with its mane? Ma'am, ma'am. Please, step aside. I need to check the content of the boxes. [Magdalene] May I ask why? [Officer Clinton] We've had a few concerning calls from neighbors. I'm just doing my job. What a warm welcome. Hey, can you just be a little more gentle? That's my son's toys. -How old is your son? -Nine. Isn't he too young to be around guns? Leave my toys alone! [Magdalene] Monet, stop! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, stop! Don't you fucking point your gun at my son. This is how you're raising your child? Leave my mom alone! Hey, it's-- it's just a game. Okay? We're just playing a game. [Monet] So, she's not a real cop? No. Certainly not. [somber music plays] Look at you growing all big and tall. [chuckles] [sighs] All right. ♪ [chuckles] [sighs] [sniffles] [Magdalene] Hey, can you stop that please? -But it's fun. -Yeah, well, not for me. [Magdalene sighs and clears throat] Okay, hey, come here, come here, come here. Do me a favor. Okay. Can you show me where this color is? I don't know. Okay, look, we know that the card says what? Green? Right, so, if the label's green, take this and match it with something else in this apartment. Mmm. Close. I can't tell. [Magdalene] Try again. Try a little harder. Mmm... [Magdalene groans] Okay. -I can't tell. -Okay. What do we know for sure is green? -The tree. -That's right. [Magdalene] Careful. Good one! -[Monet] Thank you. -Mm-hmm. Okay, what else? I don't know. Give me a clue. [Magdalene laughs] Is the sky always blue? -Not always. -Mom, look at the sun. Hey, don't look up there too long, okay? I like how bright it is. Yeah, but, Monet, you're gonna go blind if you stare too long. I'm already blind. Monet, you're not blind. Says the blind. Monet, we're colorblind. Well, that's still blind. -[indistinct] -Monet, I don't want to hear it. [Magdalene] Stop. Please. Okay, listen, there are people that can see color, but that doesn't make them any different than we are. People label colors just like we do. They just do it in their minds. But, look, we got a better imagination, right? [Monet] Mmm. [Monet] What colors do you see in the sky? I see pink and red. Like a giant pomegranate. Like a giant pomegranate. Where'd you get all that imagination? Can we eat pomegranates tonight? [groans] Baby, I don't think there are enough pomegranates on this planet to satisfy your appetite. We haven't had any since we moved here. All right, all right, um, when we're done furnishing the apartment, I'll run out and grab some pomegranates, okay? Can you come help me with this map? Grab that side. Did you know that where we originally come from, there's tons of pomegranate trees? Can we move back? Maybe. One day. [slow piano instrumental plays] Yes? Can I help you? Hi, Mr. Walton. Sorry to bother you. How do you know my name? I'm the new tenant downstairs. New tenant? Yes, I'm Magdalene. The rental management told me just to pay you directly-- Hold on, there must be some kind of mistake. I'm expecting a Magdalene Whyte. Yeah, that's me. W-H-Y-T-E. I know it's weird seeing a Black person with a white last name, like, literally Whyte. [laughs] Huh, strange. But management informed me that an old white woman was here looking for an apartment for her daughter. Yes, that was my mom, she was helping me out. She used to live around this area. Your mom? Is this some kind of a joke? [she sighs] All right, let me explain before you think I'm crazy. So, I was adopted by a white woman. She couldn't have any kids of her own, so, she raised me... and she gave me the good Catholic name, Magdalene, and, of course, I took her last name and so here we are. [Walton] Huh. Believe me, if I could pick a Black family, I would, for everyone's convenience and clarity. [chuckles] [clears throat] Right, uh, so, here is this month's rent and deposit. -Thanks. -Wait, wait. I want to count it first. Make sure you didn't give me more than I asked for. [both chuckling awkwardly] We good? We good? Um, there was a boy in the application. That's my son, Monet. -Monet? -Mm-hmm. I named him after my favorite artist. French impressionist artist? Was going blind through his career, but still painted anyway? -No? -No. Don't know. [Magdalene] Mm-hmm. Where's the father? He's not with us. Oh. So, you have a man or someone to look after? Look, um, are we good? Can I go? -So I can-- -Yeah, I, uh. -I'll just get your receipt. -Thanks. Got a nice place. Could use some color, though. I'd love to give you one of my paintings. [Walton] I hate colors. Of course. -You paint, huh? -Yup. Professionally? Yeah, that's why I moved here. I got an invitation from the city's Contemporary Art Gallery and I hope to use that to help pay for my son's education. Hmm. You know, the gallery's closed, yeah? Look, you'll get your money on time, okay? Well, I'm gonna need last month's rent. What do you mean? Well, you said you paint, right? So? I'm gonna need last month's rent in case something happens. [sighs] In case what happens? Look. I'm a retired firefighter. I assess risk for a living. Given this current situation, it seems highly unlikely to be able to keep up with the rent. And, uh, your damage deposit won't be enough to clean the cheap paint off my expensive furniture. I'm sorry, cheap paint? Yeah. My apartment, my rules. You're lucky I accepted your application. -Unknowingly. -Still. A lot of landlords in this neighborhood wouldn't be so open-minded. Well, thank you for your open-mindedness, but I don't have that kind of money for you. I mean, there must be some kind of renters' protection, or some human rights. Look, you do what you have to do... but I'm a firefighter and you don't play with fire. [sighs] [eerie music plays] [wheezing and coughing] [inhaling] [gasping and coughing] [panting] ♪ [gasping for air] [Mr. Walton chuckles] Uh, bet you don't have colored neighbor problems where you are, Mr. Jackson. [sighs] All right. [plays mellow piano melody] [coughing] -Sorry. [coughs] -Asthma, huh? Damn. I think I heard this is a good brand. Yeah, it gets worse in the winter. [she clears throat] Uh, you know what? I-- I'll take that another time. Okay, well... I think I'm gonna need one of these inhalers my damn self. -[he laughs] -Excuse me? Well, girl... you so fine... [sighs] ...you're taking my breath away. [laughs] Oh, Lord. All right. I bet you say that to all the ladies -that come in here. -Oh, no, no, no. Just to a fine sister like you with a sense of humor. See, I can't be myself around these other folks. -If you know what I mean. -Yeah. The name's Benyah. You new here, right? Yeah. Magdalene. Just moved in. With my son, actually. These are all for him. -[she chuckles] -He must love pomegranates. Oh, he's obsessed with them. Jesus, $25? What is this? Some forbidden fruit? -Uh. -It's not even red. [chuckles] Well... let me tell you a secret. You see, I call these diaspora pomegranates. Taken from their native land. Trying to blend into their new home for over 400 years. But don't be deceived by their exterior... because deep down, they haven't forgotten who they are, their true colors. They know who they are and where they come from. Do you? That one's coming out of your pocket, Benyah. Oh, yeah, don't worry about that, Alvin, I'll put all these on my-- on my tab. -Oh, no, I can't allow that. -Yes, you can. Just consider it a welcome gift. [chuckles] Okay. Thanks. [Magdalene laughs] Wow. You okay? Ooh, okay, okay, okay. Don't drip it. -You'll spill everywhere. -So good. Did you do your homework? No homework, it's winter break. Okay, school is closed, but education is not. You don't stop learning just 'cause they tell you to. But I want to be a painter like you. Oh, baby. This world is too cruel to artists. Plus, I want to make sure you get an education that I wasn't able to have, okay? So that when the opportunities come, you just catch it. [cartoon sound effects on TV] [orchestral cartoon music plays] Let me show you what I learned today. You see this pomegranate? See all the seeds stick together? That's how we gotta stick together. You know, sometimes life, it's gonna be tough on you. It's going to squeeze you... pressure you to every last drop exactly. But... even then... we stay together. Like a pomegranate. -Like a pomegranate. -Mm-hmm, lock it in. -Like a pomegranate seed, baby. -Like a pomegranate. [both laugh] All right, here you go. -To our new home. -And my new friends. -Cheers. -[glasses clink] Oh. Oh! Excuse me. Where did you learn that from? I've seen how you drink. Wait, so you're telling me I'm raising a little spy? What else have you seen? [playful piano music plays] [laughs] Oh, wow. Okay. Just gonna embarrass me like that, huh? Okay, great. Go to your room.

[knocking on door] -Yes? -Hi, I'm Monet. Hello. What do you want? My Mom asked me to bring this dish to you, but don't eat the flower though, that's just the symbol of peace, I guess. Yeah, well, that's very nice of your Mom, but I'd rather be alone in peace. Thank you very much. You can eat alone in peace. Here. [sighs] Okay, tell you what. You stay here. I'll be back with the plate. Holy moly, was that ever good! Oh, delicious! Man, oh, man. [groans] [sighs] There you go. All in one go, all done. Delicious. That was fast. Yeah, well, you tell your Mom, thanks very much, but, uh, I'd rather see the overdue rent on a plate next time. She said sometimes people need kindness more than money. Is that so? You wait here. [chuckles] I'll give you a symbol of peace. [tea kettle whistles] Peace out. [gentle music playing] [sighs] How'd it go? Why did he give you these? As a symbol of peace, I guess. Did-- did I do something wrong? No, baby, you didn't. No. Listen. I don't ever want you talking to that man again. You understand? But you said kindness goes a long way. Yeah, I was wrong. He's a giant and giants have the smallest hearts. Come here. Come here. Okay. Hold still, hold still. Don't move, don't move. Voila! Now, you just gotta keep it on for ten minutes, okay? Can I keep it on longer? [Magdalene] No, baby, no, you can't. Do bright people have bright colors? What? My friend Abby used to tell me that. Let me show you something. I want you to think about... how much you love me. Really feel it, okay? Okay. Now, still feel the same love for me? Okay, good. How about... now? Still feel the same love for me? Okay, see? Doesn't matter how you look on the outside. If someone has love in their heart for you or hate... the outside doesn't change. On the inside... you still feel the same. You understand? Yep. Why do we have to look different? [Magdalene] Hmm, well... Look, you think these masks look different, but they're not. They have the same essence, just different colors. Listen. What's really important... and the most important thing is... having fun. -[water splashing] -[both laughing] Okay, okay, okay, okay! You know, Shelby, we gotta get you a mate. Yeah. No, me. Me? [laughs] I'm not alone. I don't-- I don't need anyone. You worry about yourself. Yeah. Yeah. You know, she would have made a great mother, you know. Look at that. Yeah. And you would have made a great babysitter. Here you go. Good boy. [sighs] Are you going to your new gallery tomorrow? -Uh, yes, but not for long. -Can I come? No, baby, children aren't allowed. But you said I wasn't a child anymore. I said you need to stop acting like a child. I am technically the man of this house. Hmm, well, technically you'll still be my child even when you have great peach fuzz growing on your booty. -[Magdalene laughs] -That's gross! Mom, I wish I'd met Dad. What was he like? Well, he was... very cute... and curious. Just like you. [giggles] [grunts] Okay! [sighs] Mom, what happens when people die? [Magdalene] Let me show you something. So over here. There are just lights... and then you cross over to the other side... they become a rainbow. See that? Your Daddy could be up there in all those colors. All right, it's time for bed. -[Monet] Good night, Mom. -Thank you. [birds chirping] Now let's find my babies a new home. Now, which one? [hums] [road din] [sighs] Just freezing my ass off all day. [woman] Not the best time to sell. Yeah, tell me about it, I've been here all day and nothing. This would be a lot easier if it was in my gallery. [woman] Your gallery? Yeah, that's-- that's why I moved here. These pieces are supposed to be in my exhibition for the, uh, Contemporary Art Gallery. [woman] Oh, you mean the MOCA Gallery? Yes. You know it? [woman] Everyone knows it, it's very prestigious. It's too sad they had to close down. Well, you know what? Art must go on, right? [laughs] You know what? I would love to give you a discount since you're my first customer here. [woman] Well, let me see. Hey, guys. [woman] How much for the yellow and green one right there? Uh... yellow and green. Um... [clears throat] Uh, this one? [woman] No, the-- no, the one that's mainly yellow with the green line, right-- right there, over there. Do you mind pointing out which one exactly you wanted? [woman] Are you sure they're yours? Oh, yeah, they're mine. I-- I painted them. [woman] I-- I don't want to get in any trouble. What-- what trouble? There's no trouble. I painted them, they're mine. I-- I'm colorblind. Oh, come on! [thunder cracks] Of course. Thank you. [soft music playing] [groans] I started as a surrealist, but after today? Yeah, that rain turned me into an impressionist. [laughs] To my new mentor, the rain. [knocking on door] [Monet] Mom, I need to pee. Baby, let me spend a little more time in this surreal reality before you drag me back. [sighs] [Monet] I need to pee! Okay, it's open. Come in. Some privacy, please. Boy, ain't nobody looking at you. Hey, and lift up the lid. You said you weren't looking! I-- I have ears, so I can hear. What are you still doing up? I had a nightmare. Oh, come here, tell me what happened. You know what you were? So colorful. Wait. You dream in colors? [Magdalene chuckles] That's weird. What happened? [Monet] You were laid down still without breathing, so calm and so silent, then slowly a huge rainbow coming out of your mouth. [laughs] Okay. A rainbow? Out of my mouth? You really dreaming in colors? Yeah, I swear to Dad. Okay. Okay, all right. I believe you. I don't think I can go back to sleep. Oh, okay, baby. Go back to bed. I'm gonna come in there in just a minute, okay? Okay. [chuckles] My baby's seeing colors. Okay. [sighs] What should I name this one? Oh, good Lord. Yikes. Gosh. Okay, how's it going over here, baby? It doesn't look as happy. [Magdalene] Yeah, I told you not to pick it. Flowers are never as happy when they're separated from the soil. [Monet] What do we do? Um... why don't we take it outside, on the patio? Get some sunlight. Wait, wait hold on. I'll give you your coat. Here. [door creaks open] [Monet] Good morning. -Nice flag. -What's that? Nice flag. -[Magdalene coughs] -I have the same one, see? [Walton] Oh, yeah. It's not the same thing, Monet. It looks the same. It's not the same, it's a different color. [Monet] But it looks the same. But it's a different color with different meeting, okay? [Monet] It looks the same. [Magdalene] All right, but it's different. Come on, let's just keep fixing this. [coughing] Excuse me, do you mind putting that out? [Walton] What's that? I have asthma, so you mind while we're out here if you could just put that out? Hey, I'm just sitting up here having a smoke on my side. Keep your smoke to your side then. Hey, talk to the wind, kid. Monet, let's go. When are you gonna pay the rent? -Talk to the wind, giant! -[Magdalene] Monet! Sorry about that. Soon. Monet, careful, careful, careful, you'll get your shirt dirty. I just washed that. [coughs] Hey, guys. How can help you? How much is this one? You know what? I can give that to you for 550. 510, we got a deal. Yeah, okay. Sure. Thanks. You only got hundreds? You have enough change? You know what, these days, all I got is change. Let me check. Okay. 20, 40, 90. Here you go. I'd take that other one if you can make the same deal. You-- you want one too? Okay, yeah, sure. [laughing] Where do you get this money from? [train rattling] Rich neighborhood, dude, rich kids. You sell on the street, you gotta have mutual trust. Yeah, yeah, of course. One sec. Thanks. [sighs] There you go. Thanks. Hey, thank you guys so much. Thank you. [laughs] You know what? Hey, when the gallery opens, I'll invite you out, and you can appreciate those on the wall. [squealing with joy, laughing] 'Cause what? I'm an artist, duh! All right, let's pack this up, okay.

When you're old enough, I'll show you around the neighborhood. [Monet] I won't go anywhere without my mom. Right, of course. Now, listen to me, Monet, um, do you have any relatives or other family in town that we could call to come watch over you? Nobody at all? Only my grandma back home. But she's far, far away. Okay, well, in that case then, um, your mom probably wants you to stay with Mr. Walton over there until she comes back. -The giant? No, thanks. -[officer] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just for a few hours. I'd rather be alone. Well, I-- I don't think that's such a good idea, okay? It's just for a little while. If you don't help me, then I can't help to bring your mom back. You understand me? Promise you bring her back. Oh, uh, Monet, one last thing. Do you know if your mom is colorblind? Uh... Is she? It's very important for us to know. No, she-- she's not weak. [officer] Okay, good. Now, why don't you pack up some stuff, Mr. Walton will come by to get you. All right? It'll be fun. I promise. [sighs] Okay, um... look, I need you to babysit the kid 'til we figure out the situation. No fucking way. I don't think so. Look, I can't bring him with me, all right? There's too much responsibility. Besides, we don't want to see this kid watch his mom going through this kind of an ordeal. -It's not his fault. -Hey, it's not my fault either. I'm the victim here. You're a retired firefighter, correct? [Walton sighs] Yes. Well, just think of this as a fire drill, all right? Look, I'm trying to put out a fire here. -[Walton sighs] -[officer] All right? Hey, you want to kick them out when she comes back? Great. But until then, I need you to babysit this kid, to take care of him, 'til the smoke clears. Will I get my money back pretty soon? Yeah, I'll do everything in my power. [sighs] Yeah. [indistinct chattering on radio] I'll be right there. I gotta go, okay? I have all your contact info, I will be in touch. -Remember, fire drill. -Yeah. [Walton sighs] [drink glugging] What? Can you pass the pepper, please? It's the red one. Hello. The red one. What, you not hungry? I'm starving. What are you waiting for? Eat. I can't eat. What do you mean you can't eat? 'Cause it's not fried chicken? I'm vegan. I'm sorry, what? I can't eat meat. I'm vegan. [laughing] That's ridiculous. A Black vegan kid. What a messed-up world we live in, I tell you. So I can't be Black, because I'm vegan, or I can't be vegan, because I'm Black? Oh, well, excuse me for not being prepared to, uh, take care of a Black vegan kid. What, do you want some ice cream, Your Majesty? Is it made with non-dairy milk? Oh, for fuck's sakes, come on. You said the F-word. -Yeah, so what? -You need to rinse your mouth. [Walton sighs] There. Happy? Oh, what do vegan kids eat? Ah, ooh. There. That vegan enough for you? [Walton sighs] [knife clacking on wood] Do you want to go to juvie? Okay, "They say Black lives matter, well, I say all lives matter. [sighs] [indistinct]. Blue lives matter, police lives matter. [mumbling] No Black people--" what? What are you memorizing? You wouldn't understand. [Monet] I heard you practicing it. It's about all lives matter, right? What? You eavesdropping on me? I know how hard it is to memorize something. I used to be the same at school, but they taught us a trick that really helped. A trick? Apparently, some people are better at looking skills, and some better at listening skills. I guess, you're the first kind, so it's best for you to listen to memorize. But it's true, it's true, you know, when I was a kid... I was a great listener. I used to spend hours listening to the piano. So what's this trick? Have someone read it to you over and over until it gets into your big, giant head. -"They say Black lives matter." -[Walton] "Black lives matter." -"We say all lives matter." -[Walton] "All lives matter." -"Police lives matter." -[Walton] "Police lives." -"Law matters." -[Walton] "Law matters." [Monet] "Order matters." [Walton] Yeah. -"Blue lives matter." -[Walton] "Blue lives matter." "Let Black lives matter to Blacks and their own Black neighborhood." [Walton] "Let Black lives matter to Blacks and their own Black neighborhood." "Let them keep their crimes away from us in their streets." [Walton] "Let them keep their crimes, uh, out of our neighborhood, off our streets." Is that right? Just forget it. Move on. "We're offering a peaceful solution." [Walton] "We're offering a future solution." Peaceful. [Walton] "A peaceful solution," yeah. Seg-- gus-- What's segregation? Um, well, it's, uh, you know, Whites with Whites and Blacks with Blacks. No mixing, you get it? No mixing, then, how do you get a colorful palette? -A what? -[Monet] My mom mixes black and white to get gray. Then, she mixes yellow and blue to get green. Then, she paints a whole colorful garden with her palate. Yeah, but that's different. We're talking about people, not paints. So paint can mix, but not people? Well, they can mix, but they shouldn't. Look at me. You know when you're doing your laundry, you have your whites and you have your colors, and you keep them separate, right? You don't mix them, because if you put the whites with the colors, the colors will stain the white. So you gotta keep them separate. So law and order, you see? -So is my skin stained? -[Walton] No, no. That's not what I meant. What I'm saying is that you and I are not the same, and we never will be, okay? So did God make us different? Yeah, I think so. Does God like each of us differently? I don't know, I'm not God. Why couldn't God make everyone the same color, and make them all the same? Why go through so much trouble to make us different? [sighs] Look, can we get back to work, please? If we're not the same, why not divide us from the beginning, and put each color in a different color planet, so we'd never know the other one existed? Then we'd never know that we're different. God sounds like a jerk that wants us to fight on purpose. Maybe God is the one who's colorblind. Jesus Christ, kid. I'm asking you to help me with my speech, not give me one. I'm sorry. I just miss my mom. She always says question things... until I understand them. Yeah, I know. I know, but some questions just... just can't be answered. The truck is blue. The wall is white. The light bulb is yellow. The plant is green. The tree is green. The people are all white. People, white, people, white, people, white, people, white, people, white, people, white, people, white, people, white. Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Stay away from that tree. Is this a family tree? I said, stay away from that tree. What about my family? When's my mom coming back? [Walton] I don't know just stay away from that tree. It's a sacred tree. I miss her and I'm bored. What do you do when you're at home and bored? [Monet grunts] I paint with my mom. Yeah, well, you can't paint here and I'm not your mom. Do you have any games to play? Uh. No. Only chess. And that's not a kid's game. I can play chess. [Walton] You can play chess? [scoffs] You're a lot smarter than you look. [quiet piano instrumental] Well, I guess we don't have to assign colors now, do we? -Let's go. -[Walton laughs] Good choice. Okay. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait. White always goes first. [Monet] I'm sorry, I forgot. Do you see everything black and white, too? -[Walton] Huh? -Nothing. [Walton murmuring] That's it. You can't keep running away, I'm gonna catch you. Now, I'm gonna punish your queen. Queen. And... checkmate. [laughing triumphantly] [phone ringing] Hold on a second, I got a phone call. Yeah, Walton here. Oh, hello, officer. Yes, yes. Uh, yeah, I've been waiting for your call. Is it my mom? What? The boy's right here, yeah. Hospital? What are you talking about? I thought I said she took him down to the station? What have you guys done? What? All right, well, keep me posted. I'm not a babysitter. Oh, hey, you can't do that. Queen's off the board. My mom says, no matter how many times you fall on your face you still have to get back up to win. Well, I'll-- I'll make an exception this time, okay? Did they say when my mom's coming back? Uh, no, but I'm sure she'll be home soon. -What's wrong? -[Walton sighs] Uh, I don't know, I'm just a little tired. I think it's time for my nap. What about the game? -You won. -Huh? I win? Yeah, you did. ["Symphony No. 5" by Beethoven playing] The black queen claims her island. Out the white soldiers, out the white castle. Out the white bishops. Out the white king, your time is up. Why don't you make yourself busy while I take a nap, huh? Don't wake me up. What if I'm hungry? Well, there's some, uh, some candies in the blue jar on the counter, but just take them quietly and don't wake me up 'cause I get really grumpy, okay? Mm-hmm. [Walton sighs] [Walton snoring softly] [floorboard creaks] [Monet grunts softly] [Monet grunts] [Monet gasps] -[jar clanking] -[Walton gasps] Oh, my God. My sweet Candy. What the hell have you done? I told you the fucking blue jar. Are you blind or stupid? No, I-- I'm sorry, the tortoise scared me. Sorry's not gonna cut it. You know what? If it weren't for that nigger drunk driver, my wife would be alive and you people can't even leave her in peace in her own house! I'll clean it up. Well, no, no, you'll clean it up by getting the hell out of my neighborhood. -Come on. -I'm not going! Now, look at you. You know what? Go back to the jungle where you came from. Maybe you'll find your mother there, huh? I'm going! Out! Get out. Oh, Shelby. Oh, you poor old thing. Look at you. It's tricky going through for-- All right, man, I got you. You okay? You're good? Yeah, of course you are. Yeah. [Walton sighs] [reporter] Magdalene Whyte, a Black artist, who was recently arrested for counterfeit money, is now in critical condition after the police locked her up unattended in the car to freeze. According to the witness footage, she was abandoned for 30 minutes and freezing temperatures before the officer showed up. The medical staff at the hospital confirmed that Magdalene had a history of asthma, which is believed to worsen her condition. It was also later revealed that she was in fact colorblind, a condition that may have played a crucial factor in her arrest and may also prove her innocence. A peaceful protest outside the hospital is now turning into a violent clash between the police and the protestors as they are becoming aware that Magdalene Whyte unfortunately just went into a coma. Let's see what they have to say. [indistinct shouting] [reporter] What do you have to say? Magdalene is still in a coma, but her brothers and sisters have just woken up. [chanting] We are wide awake!

What are you doing in here? Come on. -Let's get you out of here. -I'm not going with you! -You have to come! -I am not going! -You have to get up. Come on. -I'm not going! -Monet, stop it. Stop it! -Not going with you! -There's too much smoke. -Not going, I'm not going! All right, take it easy. Here we go, come on. Let's go upstairs, get upstairs. [fire alarm keeps beeping] Breathe in, breathe out. There you go. You're doing good. All you need is a little fresh air. [Walton laughs] You're gonna be just fine. That's it. Keep breathing, keep breathing. Yeah, you want a-- you want a glass of water? I'll get you a glass of water. Hang on. [Monet sighs] There you go. Sip it slowly now. Now, what were you doing with all those candles? I was trying to pray for my mom. You know, you're lucky I'm a firefighter. You could be dead. -I'm sorry. -No, no, I'm sorry. I overreacted. I shouldn't have left you alone. [Walton sighs] So you're a real firefighter? Yeah, I'm-- Yes. Well, I was. How many lives have you saved? [Walton sighs] Let me see. Well. [sighs] Not as many as I wished I could have. Is this your wife's room? Monet-- why didn't you tell the truth? [Monet] What truth? That you and your mom are both colorblind? It would have changed everything, cleared up any misunderstandings if we knew. My mom says nothing changes as long as other person's still colorblind. [Walton sighs] I miss her. Do you ever miss your mom? My mom? [scoffs] Yeah, I haven't thought about my mom in a very, very long time. I can't even remember what it's like to be a kid. -[Walton chuckle] -Do you want to remember? Try it. What? Me? Uh-huh. Yes, you. Yeah, let's see. Hang on. I do red here, you do blue here. [Walton] Okay, okay, okay. So, what do you think? You're just like a robot. Let it loose. Hey, I'm a piano player, not a painter. I can only play the piano with these hands. Then imagine you're playing piano with paint. [Walton] What does that mean? Hey, hey, hey, be careful. Don't get it on the floor now. Whoa, whoa, are you-- are you out of your mind? Come on! Come on, try it. You know something? I'm trying really, really hard to like you, but it's getting very difficult, boy. You told me not to get on the floor. See? I didn't. Come on! Okay, okay. I got it, I got it, ready? -[Walton humming] -[piano music playing] -Fun, right? -[Walton grunts] It is kind of fun, actually. Nice play, high five. [indistinct] What color is this? Purple! Hey, you put blue and red together and you get purple. Oh. [Walton] Yeah, oh. Oh, Candace, my wife... always wanted to have kids. [chuckles] Now I know why. Why didn't you? Well, we almost did. And then, uh... and a drunk driver... bad car accident... You know, the kid we would have had-- had a grandchild about your age now. -[electricity crackles] -[Walton sighs] -[Monet] What happened? -[Walton] Oh, this old building. I'll be back in a minute. [match crackles] And now we are cavemen. [Walton laughing] You know this-- I don't know what it is, it's very strange, but you look awfully familiar to me. Maybe you've seen my dad. My mom says we look the same. Well, maybe. I wish you could have saved him, too. [Walton] Saved who? Your dad? Yeah. He died from burning in a fire. Oh, that's horrible. I'm so very sorry. It's okay. I wasn't born yet. The firefighters tried, but they couldn't get there in time. When did he die? While my mom was pregnant with me. That was back home, right? [Monet] No. When my mom and dad used to be students here. They used to work at a painting studio downtown. -[Walton] Mm-hmm. -One day... everything caught on fire... and burned everything. No, no, that doesn't seem possible. It can be if you're not careful. The paint caught on fire. Everything got burnt. -You want to come see? -[Walton sighs] Yeah, sure. Just don't tell my mom. She would kill me. [Walton breathes heavily] Is this your dad? He was so burnt, they couldn't bury him, so they put him in that jar. Was your wife burnt too? No. Do you have a picture? [somber instrumental music] Oh. It's-- it's-- [sobbing] Oh. [sobbing] [Walton panting] It's okay. My mom says he's in a better place now. Yeah. I-- I don't feel so good.
