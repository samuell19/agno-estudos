Max. Max. Max. Roxanne? What's wrong? Hello? Hello. - Max, where the heck are you? - PJ? - You should have been here an hour ago. - What? Hold on. Oh, no! Maybe we should call the whole thing off. No way, man. It's now or never. You better get a move on. Meet at my locker. Mornin', Son. Dad! Oops. I forgot. Mornin', Son. Came to see if you had any dirty... clothes. There they are. Help yourself. Max. Thought we talked about this. I'm sorry, Dad. I'll take care of it later. - What's the big rush? - I'm running late. - I could drive you on my way to work. - No, thanks. - I... need the exercise. - Come on, Max. Dad! Dad, you ruined it. Sorry about that. Who was he, anyway? It's only Powerline, Dad, the biggest rock star on the planet. Not bigger than Xavier Cugat, the mambo king. Everybody, mambo! Dad! There's no time for this! What if the neighbours see us? Maxie, wait up! You forgot your lunch.

And now, without further ado, Principal Mazur. Thank you, Stacey, and good morning, boys and girls. You know, every year on the last day of school, I have several youngsters approach me and say, "Principal Mazur, what can we do to not waste our summer vacation? We don't want to waste our free time sleeping or visiting friends." Say, Roxanne, about Stacey's party... How you... How you doing down there, Bobby? Don't give me that attitude, you guys. I'm doing it all for you. This is nuts. I don't know why I let you guys talk me into this. If my dad finds out, he's gonna nuke my entire existence. I hope this works.

Who's next over here? Step aside, Goof. Let a pro show you how it's done. OK. Who's next over here? Hello, precious. You lucky woman. Now, you come on there, honey. It's picture time. Peekaboo! - She's so cute. - Peekaboo! Gosh, Pete, you sure are good with kids. Yeah. They love me. Why, PJ, he's been begging me to take him on vacation this summer. - Really? Where you going? - Camping. Nothing like the great outdoors to strengthen the bond between a father and a son. Max would never go for anything like that. - I don't know, Goof. - Gimme! Something's wrong when a kid won't spend time with his parents. For all you know, he's running around with some gang and stealing stuff and causing riots and... Gimme! Max is a good kid. He'd never get mixed up in something like that. I'm a failure. Complete loser. My one chance to impress Roxanne, and I blew it. Max, look. It's a leaning tower of cheese-a. Oh, man. My dad is gonna smash me like a bug. Hey, PJ! Detention! Hey, PJ! Detention! Robert Zimmeruski. OK. I'm coming. Max, here. Guard this with your life, dude. Hey, Maz-ur! What's up, bro? The air-conditioning went on the fritz, and the place would be like a sauna. Then I thought, "Use it." So my theme's gonna be, "Powerline goes rain forest." Too much? Roxanne, are you listening? Stacey, I don't want to... Talk to him. Tap him. - Gosh, I'm sorry. - It's OK. Really. I liked your dance. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, it's from Powerline's new video. I know. He's totally a genius. He's doing a concert next week in LA. Yeah. Stacey's showing it at her party. - Yeah. - Yeah. Roxanne, I was... sort of kind of thinking that maybe I'd... ask you to go with me. That is, to the party. If you don't want to, I'd completely understand. Well, I was sort of kind of thinking that... I'd love to. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Good. - Great. - Terrific. - Wonderful. - All right. - OK. Come on. We don't want to belabour the moment now, do we? I'd better be going. I'll call you later. OK. Bye. Oh! Bye. See? I told you men are easy to deal with. Yes! She said yes! Everybody, mambo! But it's not my break yet. Yeah! Dance with her. Groove with her. - Miss Maples! - Yes, sir! Get that boy's father on the phone at once! Right away, sir! Hello? Yes, Mr Goof. This is Principal Mazur. I'm calling in regard to your son, Maximilian. Max? Oh, my gosh. Is he hurt? No, Mr Goof. He's in trouble! Trouble? What kind of trouble? - Dressed like a gang member, - Gang member? your son caused the entire student body to break into a riotous frenzy! - Riot? Couldn't be my... - If I were you, Mr Goof, I'd seriously reevaluate the way you're raising your child before he ends up in the electric chair! Electric chair? What am I gonna do? Blue light special on aisle 3. Blue light special on aisle 3. Lake Destiny. OK, kiddo. Now, smile! Lake Destiny, Idaho! - Lake who? What? - You were right, Pete. Nothing like the outdoors to strengthen the bond between father and son. - You said so yourself. - Yeah, but... I'm going fishin'! I'm going fishin' with my boy! Yeah. OK, precious, give me a big smi... Fishy! Fishy! - Cool concert, lad. - What? You wailed, bud. - Hey, Max. Wicked dance. - Thanks. Forget it, girl. He's Roxanne's. Way to go, man! I just heard about you and Roxanne. - Oh, Peej, get off. - You stud! See? I told you our plan would work. Max. Max. - Peej, knock it off. - Max. Max! Maxi-mum. Max-imum! Max! Max! Max! Max! Max! It's a piece of cake. Going somewhere, Pop? - Sure are, pal-o-roony. - Cool. Have a good time. If you'll be gonna be gone more than a month, drop a line. But, Max, this isn't just my vacation. It's a vacation with me and my best buddy. - Donald Duck? - No, silly. With you. Are you OK, Maxie? - What did you say? - That's right. A vacation, Son. We'll spend some real quality time together. I'm gonna be sick. Got a present for ya. Dad, stop! I can't go! I got things to do! You look just like I did at your age. Please don't say that. Wait. I saved the best for last. It's been handed down from Goof to Goof to Goof. And now it's yours, Son. - A stick? - No, silly. A fishing pole. Fishing? We're going fishing? Yup. Just like my dad and me did. Two best buddies fishin' on Lake Destiny, away from it all. I don't want to be "away from it all," Dad. - Like it all. - Look, Maxie. We're using the same map me and my dad used. We'll take the same route and make the same stops and see the same sights. But that trip would take weeks, Dad! Exactly! Gettin' there is half the fun! Put the map away. It's not gonna happen... Careful, Son. You'll wrinkle my past. And our future. What the map says, Max, we will follow. That's very mystical and everything, Dad, but, seriously, there's this party I have to go to. There'll be time for parties when you're older. When I was your age, I'd never even been invited to a party. Look at me now! Great, Dad. - Hop in, Maxie. - No. All right then. Guess I'll just have to go all alone, that's all. Just sit in the boat all alone and... talk to myself. All alone. - I guess so. - Come on. - Hop in. - No, Dad. - Just hop right in there. - No. Come on, Maxie. Go for it! I'll just buckle you up, and we're ready for takeoff. - Set for adventure? - Why are you doing this to me, Dad? 'Cause I don't want you to end up in the electric chair. - Electric chair? - I'm not giving up on you. Together, we're gonna work this out. Work this... But, Dad... No "buts" about it, Maxie boy. Your old pop knows best. But... Goodbye, house. Goodbye, mailbox. Goodbye, pile of broken wood. Goodbye, hopes. Goodbye, dreams. Goodbye, Roxanne. Roxanne! I gotta stop somewhere first to talk to someone. - Well... - Turn here! Watch out! Here! Pull over! Make it quick, Maxie boy. We gotta put some road behind us. You get and cancel your first date in less than an hour. Must be some kind of lame-o record. Hi. Is Roxanne home? My name is Max. Does Roxanne live here? Does she even live on this block? Wait! It's OK, Daddy. Max is a friend from school. Go on. Go on. Good Daddy. Hey, Max. How ya been? You want to... have a seat? Daddy! He'll be better behaved when you pick me up for the party. Yeah, that's sort of why I came by. I'm really looking forward to it. - Yeah. I was, too. - Was? My dad's on this stupid father-son kick, and... Don't worry about it. It's just a dumb party. No, it's not. I really wanted to go with you... - No, I understand. - My dad surprised me. - Things happen. - I have no choice. - I'm sure I can find someone else. - Someone else? I'll just talk to you later. Roxanne... My dad is... My dad's taking me to the Powerline concert in LA! Your dad's taking you across the country just to see a concert? Well, you see, my dad... knew... ...knows Powerline. They played together in a band. Yeah! Come on, Son! Let's get the show on the road! Just a minute, you party... animal, you. You're really serious. Absolutely. So... you aren't still thinking of going with someone else, are you? - Well, I guess... - Because I was hoping I could... ...wave to you onstage when we join Powerline for the final number. This is incredible. I wouldn't miss our date for anything that wasn't incredible, Roxanne. Have a great time at the concert. I'll see you on TV. I'm in deep sludge. Day one. Well, here we are. Out on the open road, retracing the steps of my boyhood. And here's Maxie! Say hi, Max. - How about a wave? - Not now, Dad. What a kidder! Fun games I used to play with my dad. "Road bingo, 20 quest..." Hey, Maxie, let's play a game. Think of a name, and I'll guess who it is. Man or woman? Oh, man. Man? That's a toughy. Let's see. - Walt Disney. - Right. I'm good at this.

Here you go, sport. What say we get our picture taken? You have got to be kidding. All right. But you're missing out. Hiya, Son! Hey, everyone, check out the dork! Say "sassafras." "Sassy-fras"! Get it! Get it! That's the spirit, Maxie! No! Dad, stop! Please! This is embarrassing! It's Dork and Dork Junior! Max! Hey. What the heck you tryin' to do? Trying to get away from you. Me? What'd I do? - Forget it. - I thought we was havin' fun. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Let's just go. Well, come on! You dropped your hat. This is the stupidest vacation! You drag me from home! You jam me in this car, then drive a million miles away to see some stupid rat show! Call me when the trip's over. Hey, Max. You wanna get in some fishin' practice?

Didn't expect to run into you. Apparently not. You're just jealous, man, 'cause you ain't got the moves. You can keep the moves. But I wouldn't mind having this RV. You are so lucky, man. Me? Come on. You're the star. - What do you... - Going to the Powerline concert. - It's unbelievable, man. - Who told you about that? Come on. Everybody in town knows about it, Max. You are gonna be famous, buddy. Especially with Roxanne. There's... only one person who doesn't know about it yet, Pee. Who? My dad. Tell me, Goof. Is that kid of yours still giving you guff? I don't know what's wrong. Seems like everything I try only drives Max further away. Maybe I ought to just back off. Wrong, Goof. Look. If you keep 'em under your thumb, they'll never end up in the gutter. Too bad, Pete. Almost. Almost? Watch this. PJ! Yes, sir! Coming, sir! Strike-ola! Thank you! Yes! And the crowd goes wild. High five, Son. Psych! Say, Goof, why don't you two stay for dinner. - Cool! - No thanks, Pete. Max and I have some fish to catch. We can do that tomorrow. So, what are we having? But, Max, I thought... Under your thumb, Goof. - Maximilian. - What? Get your gear, little man. We're goin' fishin'. And I mean now! Dad, I don't even know how to fish. Come on. That never stopped me. Let me show you a family secret, handed down through about 12 or 13 Goof generations. The perfect cast. The perfect what? The perfect cast. My dad taught it to me when I was about your age. OK, now. Watch carefully. You gotta be loose. Relax. With your feet apart, aim. Ten o'clock. Two o'clock. Quarter to three. Twist, over, pas de deux, I'm a little teapot. And the windup... and let her fly! The perfect cast. And now we reel her in. Quick, get the camera! Must be over three pounds. I don't want to miss this. Look, Max. Dad? It's Bigfoot! Could you back up a bit, Mr. Foot? You're out of focus. What's the idea? Bigfoot! Behold the legendary Bigfoot. Fabled, but seldom... - It's locked! - Quick, the sunroof. Hurry up! Hurry up! I can't believe it. Bigfoot. And I got the only video. We're gonna be famous! Let's just get out of here. Is he gone yet? Nope. Still here. Gee, Max, was that Bigfoot or your stomach? Man, I'm starving. Alphabet soup, comin' up. Dad? Dad! Stop playing around! He's coming! It's nice to know this thing's good for something. What's so funny? Hi Dad soup. Huh? Don't tell me you don't remember Hi Dad soup. Oh, come on. Sure you do. You used to spell things out using the letters, like "Hi Dad" or "Maxie" or... - Ambidextrous? - Yeah, that's...? Little words like... Hasta la vista? Like "bye-bye." Or "I pledge allegiance..." Or "I love you..." Is it... soup yet? I almost forgot. Where'd you learn to do that? Your granddad taught me that when we went to Yosemite. - You two did a lot together. - Yep. - You and I have... - Dad, I'm sorry... How's the soup? Not bad. What? Nothin'. We might as well get some shut-eye. I don't think we're going anywhere tonight. Hi, Maxie. Dear Roxanne: Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd drop you a line. Dad and I are having a great time. We're only days away from LA, and I can hardly wait for the big concert. More Hi Dad soup, please. Dear Roxanne: I'm sorry I lied, but I'm not really going to the Powerline concert. You may never want to see me again... Oh, man. I'm dead no matter what I do. How many cups of sugar does it take to get to the moon? Three and a half? - Pick up! - Hold your horses. - Short stack? - Right here. Here you go. Eggs? Eggs? Eggs! - Yeah. Right here. Sorry. - Here you go, cutie. Max, I think we need to talk about this. Seems to me you need to start taking some responsibility around here. Excuse me. Can I have your attention, please? I, Goofy, hereby dub my son, Maximilian, official navigator and head "which-wayer" of this here road trip. Isn't that nice? Seriously? I'm not even looking at the map anymore. In fact, you can pick all the stops from here to Lake Destiny. Trust you wholeheartedly, Son. To the open road. To the open road. Oh, boy! Check out the bed. Check out the dresser. Coral! Nice lamp. Classy choice there, navigator. This is the police! We've got the place surrounded! You Goofs come out with your hands up! You should have seen the look on your face! - You really had him fooled, Pete. - Me? You jumped out of your skin. I was just pretending for your sake. - Right. Sure. - Did too. Did not! Oh, ain't this sweet? Don't let him fool you with that buddy-buddy act now. Under your thumb. So, since we're all being palsy-walsy here, how about letting me hook up the RV? - Well... - It's a tiny extension cord. - You'll hardly notice it. - Okay. Great! PJ! Hey, Goof, why don't you order us some pizza. This might take a while. - I mean it. They... - Here you go, kids. I'm gonna check out the hot tub. - OK, sir. - All right. I can't believe you. Whatever made you think your dad would fall for a stupid idea like that? It wasn't stupid. It was really stupid. Changing the map? I didn't know what I was doing. I was panicked. Taking a break from the MTV generation? Can't say as I blame you. People are always putting too much water in these things. So, you and your son seem to be getting along just hunky-dory. Yeah. It's been great. It's funny, but none of your techniques worked for me. Harder I tried, the worse it got. Once I eased up, things just clicked. Oh, that's swell. So, there's... no problems then? Not a one. I just hate to be the bearer of bad news, but... What is it, Pete? Your kid's dupin' you. What do you mean? I heard the little mutant telling PJ he changed the map. You're heading straight to LA, pal. - What? - You tried, Goof. He's just a bad kid, that's all. - I don't believe you. - What? I don't believe you. Don't take my word for it. Check your map. I don't need to check the map. I trust my son. Maybe Max isn't all the things that you think a son should be, but he loves me. My son respects me. Yeah. Check the map, Goof. Hey, Dad. Sorry about the mess. I'll clean it up. - I think I better go. - See you, Peej. Don't forget. Powerline. Here you go, navigator. Just follow my route on the map, Son. Here comes our junction. Max, this is it. Left or right? Come on, Max! Left! How about a song, Dad? A game? A game. Yeah. A game. A man or a woman? A man? Walt Disney. Dad. Listen, about my directions... Will you listen to me? I got to tell you something, Dad. Why bother? I'm probably too stupid to understand anyway, right? Forget it. The car! - What, now you want to drive, too? - No, Dad. The car! Look! The car! - What did you do now? - Nothing. I only touched it. - You locked it. - I locked it? It's your door. You locked it. You distracted me. You should've put the brake on. Why don't you just put it on yourself? See? You ruin everything. Well, you ruined the vacation. I ruined it? I never wanted to go... ...on this stupid vacation! - Look where you got us, Dad. - Where I got us? - You should've let me stay at home. - Why? So you'd end up in prison? Prison? What are you talking about? - Your principal called me. - It's not what you think. You even lied to me. I had to. You were ruining my life. I was only trying to take my boy fishing, OK? I'm not your little boy anymore, Dad. I've grown up. I've got my own life now. I know that. I just wanted to be part of it. You're my son, Max.

I saw you on TV. - You were great. - Yeah? I mean, no. No. I mean... Roxanne, I lied to you. I don't even know Powerline. What are you talking about? A billion people saw you dance. Yeah, well, I never met him before the concert, that is. You mean, that story about Powerline and your dad... Why would you make that up? I don't know. I guess I just wanted you to like me. I already liked you. From the very first time I heard you laugh. So, you wanna do something tonight? Definitely. No, I can't. What? I'm kind of doing something with my dad. Honest. How about tomorrow? Deal. Roxanne, I'd like you to meet my dad. Enchantée, mademoiselle.
