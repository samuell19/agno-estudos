You, uh, got any idea, lieutenant? Some. Oh, terrific! Put that down. "Some." Look, for the strong silent type, I go to the movies. From you I desire only a statement. No statement. Look. Listen, give us a break, will you? She was hit by a flying saucer. Graham, what's the matter with you? - You get a good look at her? - Sure. A woman walks along the streets of this town, minding her own business. Maybe coming home from the job. Some ape jumps out of the dark and does that to her. Well, sure, but you handle these all the time. That's right. It runs in cycles. We had a slew of 'em last year. Now maybe it's starting again. That's what's the matter with me. No! No! Girls, stop. Remember what we were going to do? The hands out stretched, and it was going to be one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Huh? You got that? Let's try it again. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Good! Leonard, if you'll tell me which of my girls you're trying to dazzle, I'll excuse her and we can go on with our practice. I'm sorry, Ms. Conway. Alright, girls. Don't eat him alive. We need him for next Saturday's game. Alright, from the top. We'll go through it one more and then it's off to the Sugar Shop and the sodas are on me. Alright? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Oh, I've forgotten my purse. Go on without me. I'll catch up. Let me get it for you. Well, alright, Sandy. Thank you. It's on the bench near the locker room tunnel. Well, come on, let's go. I still say he'd have to be crazy to come back here after what he did here last night. Who's he? Oh, um, I know him. He's Bennett. Bennett. He's okay. Owns a big lumberyard. Here, here, sit down. Sit down. Don't let me disturb anybody. Look, I brought you a sweater now. I thought you might need it. I'm okay, dad. Now you put that on before you leave here. You know, you kids are all the same. You think just because you've got so much pep and muscle- Dad, please. Alright now. By the way, I've got the car outside. - I'll give you a lift home, hm? - Yeah, sure. And don't let me hurry you. You take your time and I'll... And I'll have a soda myself. And let me know when you're through, hm? Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice of you. Kids. You know, if you could harness all of this energy, it would run our power plant for a year. I'm Lois Conway. Music department. Oh, I'm Bennett. Uh, Leonard's father. Yes, I guessed as much. You have a fine boy, Mr. Bennett. Oh. Well, he's a great athlete. Great. Oh, I'll have a lemon and lime, please. You know, lime is good for the stomach. I made Leonard take some every morning. Well, doesn't he like it? That's immaterial. Are you married, Ms. Conway? No. Why not? You look as though you ought to be. Well, I have my story, Mr. Bennett. Just like a lot of people do. You know, I brought that boy up myself. We run a real bachelor house. Not even a cleaning woman. You must be very proud of him. Yes. He's doing the things that I never could. Oh, I- I had rheumatic fever as a lad. It wrecked my heart. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Why, you're just saying that. Politeness. You can't be sorry unless you know what it's like, what it feels like. You've gotta sit on the sidelines watching others do the things you wanna do. But that boy is going to get everything he wants out of life. He knows how to win. He knows the secret of it. Do you know what he did when he was only seven years old? The Diving Trophy? No. That proves you're still a newcomer. Why, that story's legend here. Tell her, son. Well, it was the 20 foot board. And on the next to the last dive, Len hit bottom and broke his wrist. When his turn came up again he started to climb up to the board. When everybody was yelling, "No, don't do it!" But he just didn't pay any attention to 'em. He dived anyway. And he won. Crowd cheered that boy for ten minutes. Oh, well, I've gotta get him on home. I'll pay for the drinks. Oh, no, no, no, I always treat my bunch. - Please, I- I'd rather- - That's alright. This is on me. Well, good day, Ms. Conway. It's very nice meeting one of Leonard's teachers. Oh, no, no. I'm not one of Leonard's teachers. - No? - No. Well, it's- it's very nice, anyway. Well, thank you, Mr. Bennett. Goodbye. No, Sandy. Honestly, no. What? And let's let it end right there, shall we? - But, Ms. Conway, what- - Bye-bye, Sandy. Morning. Kids, kids! Honestly, I sometimes get a feeling that they're always the same ones, that they never grow up. Some of them grow up fast enough. Sandy. Come here a moment, please. I wanna talk to you. What is the meaning of that? Sandy, how could you? Ms. Conway, I... I don't know what you're talking about. Of course you don't. Sandy, I'm sorry. Go on to your class. Sometimes I just don't understand you. Ms. Conway, can I ask your advice about something? It's a matter of life or death. Certainly, Janet. What is it? Well, suddenly for no reason at all, my father says I'm too young to wear lipstick. Well, I try to respect my father, but he's ancient. He's 38. See me after school. I'll see if I can give you some tips. - Lois, help! - Goodbye. - Lois, help! - What are you doing? Moving the lab? Oh. No, I had these things in my own lab. I hope they're not breakable. I don't think they are. I thought I'd show the kids an interesting experiment. Who knows? Maybe they'll try it at home and blow themselves sky high, and I'll never see their dear, earnest, scrubby little faces again. - What's the matter? - Oh, nothing. Well, you usually willing to humor my feeble attempts at levity with wild bursts of laughter. What is it? Trouble? No. Well, yes, it is too, sort of. It's... Well, it- it's not with the top brass. It... Oh, it isn't trouble at all. It- it's just something that's kind of annoying. Well, what? I've gotten a note from one of the boys. Oh, don't tell me you haven't received notes before. This one is different. Written in blood? In fire! I'm surprised the sentiment didn't burn the paper. Well, children feel very deeply. - This was hardly a child. - Mm. - Do you want my advice? - Yes. What should I do? I don't even know who sent the note. My advice is to quit teaching and look about for a husband. Are you being cynical or kindly? I'm sorry. I spoke too soon. Well, come around again in a few years. Hmm. In a few years I'm going to be just like him. Of course. All of us. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. One of our boys thinks he's fallen madly in love with me. Not knowing who the boy is, this is the only way I have of reaching him. Whoever you are, I must warn you. If you don't stop sending these notes I'm going to take this matter to Mr. Pendleton. You will be found out and you may be expelled. Of course that means no diploma. No diploma, no college. And I must say. With all these pretty girls around here, if I'm the best he can do, things must be getting pretty tough. Alright. Let's have a little music now. Let's start with 22. Are you in there? Lois: I've come here because I'm your teacher and I want to help you, to keep you out of trouble if I can. So let's just turn on the lights, and... Oh, come now. Young man, listen to me, please. You must stop this nonsense with these notes. It's not the right kind of thinking for a high school... Put that light out, please. Stalker: Don't make like a teacher. Is that what we're here for? Put that out. Stalker: Oh, so you want us to be in the dark. Okay. But not yet. Come here. - Come here. - You young idiot. Stalker: Come here. You are an idiot. Stalker: Sure, an idiot over you. Please take that light off of me. Stalker: But I'd like to look at you. I'd like to take a real good look at you. Please... Stalker: Okay. Oh, no you don't. What's that perfume? I smell it whenever you pass. Now listen to me. You're gonna march right... Stalker: You wouldn't fix yourself up the way you do if you didn't want me to notice. That's true. You're right. All women want to be attractive to men. But I am a lot older than you are. And I am still your teacher. Now, if you'll just give me that flashlight. We'll forget this ever happened at all. Stalker: I'll give you the flashlight. Sure I'll give you the flashlight. Now, look here, young man. You're only inviting trouble. Sooner or later you're going to be found out. Those notes you wrote, I still have some of them. And you can be traced, you know? Stalker: Quit kidding! You tore them up! No, not the last ones. They're at home. Stalker: So you think you're gonna get me in a mess? Young man, you're in a mess right now. Stalker: Okay. Then I might as well get something from it. Hey! Hey! - What's the trouble? - Woman ran outta here. What's the trouble, miss? You better come with us. Graham: Any identification? Tommy: No identification. Says she dropped her bag in the locker room when the guy grabbed her. So we had a look. What about the night watchman? Tommy: Said she come flying outta there like she'd seen a snake. He didn't go in. He wants to live to collect his pension. Think he's dumb like us? Okay, Tommy. Oh, yeah. We gave her the drunk test. Clean as a whistle. Stop hating him. He's a good cop. - Am I under arrest? - No. Well, then I'd like to go home. I'd like to talk. There's nothing to talk about. I don't want to file a complaint. And I don't want any police investigation. That was a high school boy, not a criminal. What's his name? Lois: I don't know his name. What does he look like? Lois: I don't know. Will you cut it out? You don't even know that much about him, yet you went to meet him at night in a stadium tunnel? Yes. Ms. Lois Conway. Is that just your professional name? What do you mean? Is it Ms. or Mrs.? Are you married? No! Why is everybody so concerned about it? Why does anybody with enough brains to get a teaching job go out in the night the way you did? What were you trying to do? Get yourself killed? - Oh, stop! - What's his name? - Who is he? - I told you, I- I don't believe what you told me! Don't you dare shout at me! Okay, teacher, you can go home now. Do you ever read the papers? And did you read what happened near your school the other night? A woman was murdered. - What? - That's right. We found her body in an alley. Well... if you mean to imply that, that you might've found another one tomorrow morning in the stadium, it completes the picture I have of your mentality. That was a high school student in the locker room. A child! Just a boy! Graham: Tell the matron I said to give you a needle and thread. Goodnight, Ms. Conway. - Yes? - The key to my house. It was in that purse I dropped on the... Get in through a window. - I lock my windows. - Well, ask the landlord. He happens to be out of town. I'll send a man with you to pick the lock. Thank you very much... Sergeant. Five seconds. Wanna time it? You won't open that lock in five minutes. I live alone. I selected it with great care. I'm glad you're on the right side. Practice. Anything else? No. Goodnight and thank you. Goodnight. I know you're here. I- I don't want to catch you. I just want you to go. I'm going to turn the light out. I won't see your face. The door is open. I- I'm not standing in your way now. Go on right out! Go on! Run! Run! Bennett: Leonard? Leonard? Dad? I didn't mean to wake you. Just felt like talking. Why, sure. - Would you rather sleep? - No, no, whatever you say, dad. Well... Well, what do we talk about, hm? The big game on Saturday? Whatever you say, dad. Anything. Dad? Hm? Oh, I was just looking at this window. Your mother used to waste hours out of every day, just sitting here looking out. There was something out there she wanted more than she wanted us. Do you know what it was she wanted, Leonard? - No. - Sure you do. I told you about that a hundred times before you were even five years old. Oh, you, you don't remember. Well, I guess I don't. Don't you remember my telling you the... well... kind of a woman she was? Not then, but you told me later. Yes, another hundred times. Yes, this was her room... till she ran away. After that I rearranged the whole house to get the sight and smell of women out of it. And I made this room over for you because I wanted someone in here I could trust. It's a wonder my heart stood up under those days, Leonard. It was a miracle. That's what the doctors called it, a miracle. I don't know how she could do it. I don't know how she could walk out on a sick man and a baby. Women can do things like that. I've been drumming that into your head ever since you were knee-high. You know, the thing that surprises me is that for a clever boy, you sometimes act as though your head was kind of thick. Well, that's not bad in football. No. No. If you knock down what I've spent years in building up... I'll break every bone in your body. Dad? Dad, what did I do now? Bennett: Goodnight. Woman on PA: All students, attention please. All students, here are two bulletins. One: More volunteers are required for the winter drama festival. Please consult the bulletin board in the auditorium for further details. Two: On the sale of tickets for Saturday's game all orders must be in not later than noon today. Hello, Leonard. Go right in. I'll bet I'm in some kind of mess. Not you. Pendleton: Come in. - Good morning, Leonard. - Good morning, Mr. Pendleton. Uh, all set for the big game tomorrow? - Yes, sir. - We're going to win? Sure. That's the spirit. - Sit down. - Thank you. - Leonard? - Yes, sir. - Where were you last night? - Home. Pendleton: From ten to approximately half past eleven? Leonard: Home. Pendleton: Not in the stadium? Leonard: At night? What for? One of our teachers has brought a very serious charge against you. Against me? Ms. Conway of the music department charges that you were in locker room B. Oh, no, sir. Not me. Uh, not I. Leonard: Yes, sir. But she says you were there and that you, um... assaulted her. What did I do? Uh... Assaulted her. You mean like that stuff I've been reading in the papers? Well, somebody's kidding somebody. Pendleton: Ms. Conway claims that you've been writing her notes. Notes that were impudent when they weren't downright indecent. Well, she's crazy. Well, no, sir. I- I mean I think she's got me mixed up with someone else. Hm. Would you like to continue, Ms. Conway? To cap it all, Leonard, you broke into my house last night and stole the notes from my desk. Leonard, I saw you. Well, I know this is a gag, but I guess, I'm slow. There's no use denying it, Leonard. I saw you, just as I see you now. Look, if you'll just tell the truth- I don't get this. I don't get any of it. I think you do, Leonard. I sent- I sent her notes? I tried something in the stadium last night? Well, gee, Mr. Pendleton, what was she doing there at night? That's what I'd like to know. How can you say I broke into your house? I don't even know where you live. You found my address in my purse. Mr. Pendleton, do you believe any of this? Well, I- I don't know what to believe. Um... Next to my father I've always counted on you. But I guess teachers just stick together. Pendleton: We're not through, Leonard. Mr. Pendleton, I've got some rights. And one of them is not to listen to anything I don't wanna hear. I don't wanna say this, but you make me. I do pretty well with girls my own age. As a matter of fact, he doesn't. Doesn't what? I found out his father doesn't allow him to go with girls. But that isn't the only lie he told. Well, he certainly looked innocent. Do you think I'm lying? No, uh... But one of us has to be. Ms. Conway, your charges aren't supported by a shred of evidence. What do you expect me to do? Nothing, Mr. Pendleton. I'm sorry about the whole thing. Well, he does happen to be a sort of a minor God around here. This could assume the proportions of a- of a scandal. I understand, Mr. Pendleton. I said I was sorry. Oh, please, teacher. I'm too young to get married. Here comes the bride! Here comes the bride! Boys! Boys! Stop this! Stop this fighting! Stop it, for goodness sake! Get up. Get up, Sandy. Go on. Everybody, go on to your classes. Oh, Sandy, your nose! Thank you, Sandy, but you really shouldn't. Oh, you poor boy! Come on, we'll fix that nose. Come in, Sandy. Sit over there. Lean your head way back up. - Does it hurt? - No. He didn't hit me here, I... I just get nosebleeds all the time. Yeah. That's why I don't go out for sports. Well, maybe it's lucky for the others you don't. You have a touch of tiger in you, Sandy. - You startled me. - Uh, I kinda startled myself. But if that blabbermouth tries anything again, I'll- Sandy. Now, listen. You're sweet and brave. And the nicest thing since Galahad. But I must insist that you let me handle my problem in my own fashion. - Ms. Conway? - Hm? Pendleton: What's the trouble? - No trouble. Just a nosebleed. Oh, well, that's really too bad. Wouldn't it be better to go upstairs to the nurse, Sandy? She's there to take care of these things. Yes, sir. Be careful. Don't bump into anything. He's my favorite student. Ms. Conway, at the moment you are a target for gossip. A boy is involved. Don't you see, then, how unwise it was to bring Sandy in here instead of sending him to the nurse? The students talk. The talk spreads. You think this is outrageous. It is. It's outrageous that we should have to live this way. But we do, Ms. Conway. We do have to. One more of those and I'll jump right into mashed potatoes. Now, if you're gonna react every time somebody laughs or makes an innocent remark... Well, Prof, the little savages are talking about it. Every class I held this morning was completely out of control. Lois, I warned you before about going out on a limb. Yes, I know you did. If it snaps off, nobody's gonna break your fall. Man on PA: Attention, everybody. Oh, brother, attention. Fiash, hot off the wires. What slick chick teacher is making with soft music in the direction of what member of what football team? See who's in my office. Man on PA: And what kind of line is she handing out? That he's the one making a play for her? Behave, teacher! You want everybody to laugh? Now, no more night trips to the stadium. This is The Eye, signing off. Leonard, will you please step outside? Now, look here, Leonard, this all started as an adventure, an impulse, just a wild idea. But do you have any idea where this might end? What do you think you're doing? Playing tease-me with some kid? First, coming around to the stadium right on time, and then because you get cold feet trying to get me in trouble. The reason I went to the stadium was to try to talk some sense into you about- I've got plenty of sense. I know this school isn't big enough to hold us both. It's either you or me. And all I care about is me. Ms. Conway wanted to talk to me. - Earthquake, Ms. Conway? - What? You look as though you just felt one. Was that what that was? Uh, Ms. Conway. Oh, hello, Mr. Pendleton. As to tomorrow night's dance after the game... - Yes, I'll be there. - Well, of course. I'm one of the chaperones, you know. Yes, I was looking at the list. Hmm, chaperone. I'd be more inclined to sympathize with the youngsters than to police them. Would you? Well, as a matter of fact, I was thinking of asking Prof to substitute for you. He has years of experience at that sort of thing. Uh, he'd had much more authority with the boys. I hope we'll have good weather for the game. Are you just considering this, Mr. Pendleton or have you already decided? Suppose you let Prof take your place? You've already decided. When? After that loudspeaker episode? Must you always argue, Ms. Conway? I'm sorry. I'll simply come to the dance. But not as a chaperone. With my ruined reputation, Mr. Pendleton? How could I? Come on. Come on, we're blocking traffic. What do you people do in case of fire? It's just an old friend. As soon as the blood begins to flow in my veins again I intend to tear you into little pieces. - Oh, relax. - Relax? Did you see the look on Mr. Pendleton's face? - Who's he? - He's our principal. - As if you didn't know. - Oh. He's the man who's now deciding to separate me from the school system. You'll find somebody to take care of you. Not if I'm continually hauled into police cars as though I'm under arrest. I'm just giving you a lift home while I ask you a few questions. I could have walked. Look, Ms. Conway, the town's going through another epidemic of assault cases. One of them ended in murder. Now, maybe living in a school room everything's sweet and clean and full of sunshine but to me, kids are like everybody else. They can go bad. So, just throw them all into jail. Don't give them a chance, just put them away. - That's all I have time for. - You have a lovely attitude. That's what I say! Now, I want to see those notes he sent you. I don't have them. They were stolen. - What? - They were. I had them locked in my desk at home and he broke it open and stole 'em. How did he get in? Remember? I dropped it at the stadium. I found it when I got home. He must have picked it up. My key was in it. So he burglarized your house? This nice, innocent, clean-cut boy? I ought to drag you up to the reform school and show you some of the angel faces roosting there. - May I get out now? - No! If you want to think that kids are your own private bailiwick, that no one else knows anything about 'em, okay. But burglary, breaking and entering that's police business. Sarge, we're gonna stop off at headquarters for a fingerprint outfit. Ten bucks says she knows the kid's name. A teacher mustn't be swayed by personal feelings any more than a doctor or a nurse. If some poor youngster seems to be nothing but a rotten little demon, we- we don't throw him down a well and- and toss rocks in after him, you know. He needs us more than the others do. - Very noble. - Oh, shut up. Only thing I remember about my teachers is that one of them smelled of snuff and another had red hair on her knuckles. What does your psychiatrist say about that? Say, somebody ought to rescue you. You've got the vinegar in your voice- - Vinegar? - Yeah. Listen to it. Can you make decent coffee? I invented it. Probably, uh, tastes of chalk. Cream and sugar. No arsenic. Nice kitchen. Uh-huh. If you're looking for Jack the Ripper, he just left. Very efficient. You do alright for somebody living alone. No one around to criticize. And now comes the question, why am I not married? That's right. Why? Well, I have a broken heart. Maybe you don't have now, but I bet you did have. Yes, I did have. All over? - Uh-huh. All over. - Good. You going to that big game tomorrow? Oh, certainly. I haven't seen a football game in ten years. I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up. Why? Well, why did you get into the car when I told you to? You knew you didn't have to. Hello, Mr. Bennett. Oh, that music teacher. Yes. Ms. Conway. Lois Conway. I'm sorry to be coming here so late in the evening. Am I disturbing you? No. Come in. Thank you. You want to talk about the boy? Yes, I do. How much has he told you? He never told me anything. Everybody in this town knows me, knows my boy. Anything that happens concerning us, I hear about it. Well, this is the first time I've ever had to go running to a parent and believe me, Mr. Bennett, it's a last resort. Oh, okay. - Won't you come in? - Thank you. This is very difficult for me. Uh... I- I know how popular your son is. They tell me you live alone, Ms. Conway. Yes. House all to yourself. No relatives, no friends. It's what they call free, emancipated womanhood, hm? That has nothing to do with Leonard. You came here to discuss him, didn't you? I'm quite willing so long as the discussion is honest. Did you ever invite him to your house, Ms. Conway? Why, no. There's a boy in one of your classes named Sandy Krupp. - Sandy has nothing to do- - You invited him. I hire Sandy Krupp to come to my house every Saturday morning to cut the lawn and cultivate the garden. That's all, Ms. Conway. - This is not all, Mr. Bennett. - I say it is. Women are pretty much the same whoever they are and whatever they are. And the only good thing here is that this boy has a father who's on his toes looking out for him. Goodnight, Ms. Conway. I'd like you to go. Mr. Bennett, I feel I must warn you. The matter isn't closed simply because that's the way you want it. The police are in this thing, too. Why? Because, oddly enough, they're the only ones who believe my side of the story. But we don't want the police. That would be... Well, the police give everything a very unhealthy atmosphere. It's funny you should use that word. That's just exactly what I was thinking. Unhealthy. Uh, Ms. Conway, it's quite possible I was wrong about you. Wrong about the boy. Humans are very likely to act like... humans. What do you want me to do? I think a good beginning would be to call in Leonard. He's upstairs studying. I'd like to tell him and I'd like you to back me up that no one is going to hurt him if he just admits the truth. Of course not. We want the truth. That's all we're interested in. Bring him down then, please. He's studying with all his heart. You know, I don't know if anyone realizes the full worth of that boy. Here, look at some of his trophies. The boy's already asleep and I don't want to disturb him. He has a big day ahead. Well, when are we going to have our talk with him? Well, I don't know. Monday maybe. Someday next week. - I have a business, Ms. Conway. - Oh. Yes, of course you do, Mr. Bennett. One more thing... Where was Leonard between 10:00 and 11:30 last night? Here asleep. How do you know? I went into his room. I saw him. That's what I thought. Goodnight, Mr. Bennett. Goodnight. Goodnight. Come back soon. Who's that? Hey, you! Hi. You crazy kid. What're you doing here? We're closed. Come on, let's go somewhere. - Unh-unh. - Why not? I've got a date. He'll be here any minute. Well, so what? Give him a stand-up. - Unh-unh. - Why not? I've had one date with you, Leonard. - So? - You move too fast. Oh. Well, they hand out trophies for that. I don't think I'd look good in silver. No, Leonard. A couple of laughs here in the Sugar Shop, okay, but no more dates. Why? What's the matter with me? Am I poison? Look, Leonard. You know how your father is. - You told me yourself. - Forget my father. We're talking about us. There is no "Us." I'm too old for you. I have other problems. Now, go home, sonny. What's age go to do with this? Look at the way Ms. Conway chases after me. Yeah, I heard that story. It may be good enough for the school to swallow, but not me. I've been out with you... for the last time. I bet if I come around there, you'll change that record in about one minute. There's my date. Be out in a minute! Come on, I've gotta lock up. Do you always look so grim? - Sorry. - It's a little better. You know, a day off should do you worlds of good. One, two, three... Crowd: Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! - Did you ever play football? - Yeah, a little. First time I ever went out with a detective. First time with a teacher. Player: One, two, three, four, five. And that's the boy you wanted me to discipline. - Shame on you. - Oh. Detective Lieutenant Graham, this is our principal, Mr. Pendleton. Oh, so this is the man we thought was arresting you! Well, well, well, well. Oh, don't lock her up, she's a thorn in my side, but we can't do without her. Good for you, Ms. Conway. I'm very happy to see this. Crowd: Rah! Rah! Rah! Is it a crime to strangle a principal? This Bennett boy, why did you want him disciplined? Oh, that- that's school business. I- it's none of yours. Excuse me, I... I'll be right back. I just remembered something. Crowd: Rah! Rah! Rah! Ben! Ben! Ben! I'm doing you out of a fare. How's this? About right? Who's arguing? What happened to my cab? Why I can't imagine. Probably got tired of waiting and left. So, I guess, it's up to the police department to get you to the dance. No, thank you. I'll walk. I'm not wearing prowl cars with this dress. Well, yeah. Well, I'll tell you. Uh, we won't use the siren. Come on. Matter of fact, we were heading for the school anyway. Oh? You know those fingerprints the kid burglar left on your desk? Funny thing, they're the same as Leonard Bennett's. You knew that all the time. What are you going to do? I got him dead to rights on a burglary charge. You're not going to arrest that child for burglary? Look, I don't care if he stole all the blackboard erasers in Ogden High, I want to hold him for questioning. Well, not about me. As far as I'm concerned the whole thing never happened at all. Graham: Only it did. And it happened to other woman. One of them was killed. I don't think I like what's going to happen tonight. If what he tried with you was only a fool prank I'll throw the fear into him and let him go. But if he's this jumping jack we're looking for I wanna know about it. You're probably going to think I'm being noble again. But you feel sorry for him. You would, too, if you knew his father. That's for the teachers and psychiatrists. I suppose you do a pretty good job. My job is to bring in the son. Must it be tonight when he's up on a cloud and everybody's so happy? I didn't arrange this. He did, the minute he sent that first note. There weren't any notes. Now, wait a minute. It was all my imagination. Like the fingerprints? His fingerprints were on my desk because... Well, uh, I couldn't get it open and Leonard was passing by and I called him in and, and asked him to... - Jimmy? - Yes. That was the word he used. Jimmy it open. Now, Mr. Detective, where's your case? - Julie, what a lovely dress. - Thank you, Ms. Conway. You think this kid is innocent of everything but what he tried with you. You think, if I take him downtown it'll hurt him hurt the school, bust everything. Even if later we let him go. Well, if you understand- I understand that you look at your job the way I look at mine. We're both very noble. Except one of us is wrong. Do you ever pray? - Mm, yes, I- - Good. Now, you just pray that this kid isn't the one I'm looking for. Because if he is, and he leaves any bodies lying around after tonight... Teacher, that terrific conscience you have is gonna give you a real bad time. Hello, Ms. Conway. Oh, hello, Sandy. Hello, girls. They think they're being modern. That's a tribal dance straight from the Congo. Yes. Astonishing coordination. We're certainly proud of your son tonight. Leonard, could you excuse yourself a moment, please? Oh, Ms. Conway. - It's terribly important. - Alright. Excuse me, fellas. Leonard... Something very serious has happened. The other night when you broke into my desk- I don't know what you're talking about! Don't talk. Just listen to me. You left fingerprints. The police have identified them. My fingerprints? That's a laugh. You can lie about a lot of things but fingerprints don't lie. Think about it, Leonard. You've read detective stories. My father's watching us. I can't even go to a dance by myself. He's gotta tag along to keep an eye on me. Ms. Conway, I could tell you a couple of things. Well, I'd like to listen. Oh, you don't know how I wish it never happened. Maybe we can clear up this whole miserable business. Hello, Mr. Bennett. Ms. Conway, I'm a man who comes straight to the point. And the point here... And any intelligent woman ought to realize it is that you and this boy shouldn't be hanging around in corners. Not after all that talk. Come on, Leonard. Well, I was just saying something to Ms. Conway. Okay, dad. He's only 18, Ms. Conway. That's very young. You were talking to that teacher. Well, sure, but just school stuff. What about? Well, she's mad because I'm not in the Glee Club. Gee, dad, with all the things I've gotta do how can she expect me to be in that too? Leonard, you have your mother's eyes especially when you're telling a lie. - Dad, if every time I- - Yes. You asking for another session like the one we had when you came home last night? No. Alright, then. - There you go. - Thank you. Ms. Conway, I've gotta talk to you. - Well, alright, Leonard. - Privately. Meet me in the cloakroom. Sandy, here. Take over for me, will you? - Hello, Ms. Conway. - Hello, girls. Having fun? - Wonderful. - Good. Lois: Leonard. Leonard! The people who teach our children. I don't suppose any explanation is necessary, Ms. Conway. Explanation? She has a sick mind or a corrupt one. The only explanation is the one the school board is going to make to the newspapers. And I'll see to it that one is made. Pendleton: The less publicity- I believe in publicity. This thing needs airing and lots of it. I want to see you Monday morning, Ms. Conway. In my office. Hi. Care for some coffee? Could care, but not much here. How did you- You should get that lock fixed. It's too easy. I'm gonna put a swinging door in there. It'll make it simpler for everyone. Hey, Vinegar. I'm sorry. I just had to hit at someone. What happened? Oh. Tell me what happened. Go ahead and arrest him. Put him in jail. I don't care what happens to that boy. Did he go after you again? Oh, no. It... They... How- how did this happen? I get cold on that side. Do you mind? No. I'm delighted to help. Have you got a hanky? Yes. What's good for tar-and-feathers? - Removing them, that is? - Whose? Mine, soon. What did he try this time? It was the neatest, dirtiest double-cross you've ever seen. He enticed me into the cloakroom to talk to me. To ask me for help. And do you know who was there? The principal. Yes, and Mr. Bennett, how did you know? That game's so old. - Where're you going? - To bring him in. Hmm. Come here. Well, I gotta go. Mm-hm. - I argue all the time. - Yeah, honey, I know. I think she's crazy. Teacher's get that way, you know. They begin to imagine things. I once had a history teacher like that. She was always talking about Napoleon. Were you carrying a weapon when you broke into Ms. Conway's house? I didn't break into Ms. Conway's house. I don't do that kind of thing! Who put your fingerprints on her desk? You know that can be done. They make a... They make a rubber impression of the fingerprint. Then they can put it wherever they like. I read about that. Graham: You read a lot of that kind of stuff? Well, when I was a youngster. Graham: You're not a youngster now, are you? Well, I guess, you still could call me one. I wouldn't think of it. But, why? I'm only 18. So was Billy the Kid. Briggs: For heaven's sake, what's going on? Get my boy out of here! Hello, Graham. What's the charge? Now make it good. I was holding four jacks when the phone rang. - Burglary. - That's a lie. At least it's absurd. Leonard? Well, I didn't do it, Mr. Briggs. Of course, you didn't, sonny, and you go right on believing that. There's also a suspicion of criminal assault. Well, now, that is ridiculous. Sonny, what'd you say into that recorder? Mr. Briggs, I don't know what kind of a grudge Ms. Conway's got against me, but- Look, they have a corrupt evil-minded teacher at that school. She proved her immorality by trying to make advances to Leonard at the school dance a few hours ago. And, now, to save her skin, they're trying to defame a decent boy. You don't have any fingerprints of my son. That's another lie! To confuse and frighten him! Well, we don't scare. We don't scare two cents worth! Hey, wait a minute. Now, I recognize you. I thought there was something. You were with her at the game. I saw you. He was with that school teacher at the football game. He knows her. Why, he's been working with her. Well, that explains a lot of things! It certainly does! To everyone except me and I'm only the counselor here. Then you better do some counseling. Tell Mr. Bennett that he's yelling on city property and if he doesn't cut it out and go home, I'll have him booked. I don't leave here without my son. Graham: Tell him. Mr. Bennett, you can't get the boy out without a writ of habeas corpus. This is Sunday morning and if I can't find a judge to issue such a writ, Leonard stays until Monday. Counselor, you're an optimist. I'm changing that suspicion of criminal assault into suspicion of homicide in connection with the killing of that woman near the school. You're crazy. Oh, you're really stickin' your neck out. This weasel could stay here until I grow fond of him. Do you know how long that might be? What do I know about homicide? What is he talking about? Graham, I have to believe Mr. Bennett. There is something personal here. You're prejudiced against that boy. Leonard, don't be afraid of them. That's what they want. Don't let them put any words into your mouth and don't sign any papers. Wait for me to show up, whenever I can. I'll tell you how things are going and don't believe anyone but me. Yes, dad. They can talk, but they can't prove much without witnesses. She said, she saw my face. Reputable witnesses, Leonard. Reputable. Leonard on tape: Now, I'd like to ask a question, lieutenant. Did anybody ever see those notes? Graham on tape: She was decent enough to tear 'em up. Those you didn't steal. Leonard on tape: I didn't steal anything. Graham on tape: Then how did your fingerprints get on that desk? Leonard on tape: Alright, I'll tell you. Graham on tape: The truth? Leonard on tape: Yeah. Leonard on tape: She called me into that house. I was passing by and she came out and asked me if I'd help her move some furniture. Graham: As simple as all that? Leonard on tape: Yeah. Graham on tape: Then, why didn't you say all this before? Leonard on tape: Well, I didn't want my father to know what a fool I was, going into her house. She's got a reputation. Graham on tape: What kind of reputation? Wait a minute! Don't turn that off! - Why? I want to hear it. - It's not necessary. - I'd like to hear it! - Why? When you know the truth, why listen to a lie? What makes you so sure it is a lie? - Well, I- I could be wrong. - You could be very wrong. Maybe I did invite that boy into the cloakroom. That's what everybody else believes. Why don't you? I'm stuck. I gotta marry you. See that you do. Well, uh, what happens next? I'm going back to put him through the wringer again. - Oh. - It's a good day for it. Rainy Sunday. Gets 'em depressed and lonesome. You think he'll ever tell the truth? Well, of course. Some just take more time than others. Well, I hope he hurries. I have my meeting with Mr. Pendleton in the morning. That's right. Well, happy suspension! Well, thank you. Well, that's a very pretty sight. It felt good, too. What do you want? Never mind. Yes. Woman on intercom: Ms. Conway to see you. Send her in. Come in, please. Uh, Ms. Conway. Sit down, please. Good morning. That's a standard phrase, gentlemen. A form of greeting. Actually, it's a very unpleasant morning, isn't it? It's certainly unpleasant for Leonard. The telephone in my home never once stopped ringing yesterday. This telephone has been ringing all morning. Parents, newspapers, general busy-bodies. All shouting for my head or yours? They think they have good reason to shout. Can't you prove that they haven't? Mr. Pendleton, I've told you the truth. Give me something to substantiate it. Some evidence. Anything with which to defend you. So, I'm to be suspended. For how long? Pendleton: The Civil Service Board convenes next month. I'll have something to say at my hearing. I sincerely hope it helps. Gentlemen, don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for yourselves. Woman on intercom: Yes, Mr. Pendleton? I don't want to be disturbed. Well, how goes it? I was just going to go find a park bench and have a good cry. Come on, I'll take you home. - You look awful. - Thanks. What've you been doing? If you ever came to pick me up for a date looking like that, I- I'd throw you out. I bet you'd like to start on Pendleton. He suspended me. No imagination. No spine! No eyes. I'd want to keep you around just to watch you when you walked away. You're good for me. Anything to tell me about Leonard? Another session from midnight till dawn. Nothing... yet. Dad, they were at me all the time. You've gotta get me out of here. I can't take much more. Yes, it's the suspicion of homicide. What have I got to do with killing anybody? It's a legal trick. It's what enables them to keep you here, while that detective tries to make a reputation for himself and clean up hers, his woman's name. Her reputation's okay. I heard Graham say it would stand up anywhere. I heard him say if it's a toss-up as to who's lying, I lose! Don't talk nonsense. What sort of reputation could you poss- Well, what about my fingerprints on her desk? That's against me, but there's nothing against her. Leonard, when will you learn? Everybody does bad things. Everybody has something hidden. Everybody. - Hello. - Hi. What're you doing? Oh, hi. I'm practicing waste motion. I'm preparing my little case for the Civil Service Board. At least, I intend to go down with all flags flying! I can't budge that kid. I can't get through to him. Come on over, will you? Just to sit in front of him. Sometimes if they keep looking at their victim long enough, these characters begin to understand the meaning of what they did. What do you say? Can you take some more? Well, it might be easier than trying to find a new job. I'll be there in 15 minutes. Graham on phone: Good. I'll see you. Okay, Bye. But it doesn't seem strange to you that a kid with your looks, the big hero of Ogden High was never known to have a girlfriend? Well, I never had time to go with girls. I hope you had time to think about them. And with your father always around watching, that's about all you could do. Leave my father out of this! You're pretty loyal to him, aren't you? - Why shouldn't I be? - That's a good question. Look what all he's doing for you. Do you have any idea the way your father's running around, trying to get out of this jam? He'll do anything. That cloakroom business at the dance, that was a pretty smart play. - That wasn't his idea! - Then it was yours. I didn't say that! The only thing that impresses me about you, Leonard, is that you're almost professional. But not quite. Lieutenant Graham. Who? Oh, hi, Knudsen. You in town or... Lakedale, huh? Ms. Conway, tell him to leave me alone. You're not in school now. Ms. Conway can't do anything. Yeah. You've lost me my job, my reputation and most of my friends. What would you like me to do for you, Leonard? But I never had anything to do with killing that woman near the school. You've got to believe me. Okay. Thanks. Look, I'll swear it by anything you say. See you. Don't bother. They got that guy. The murderer? The- the one you call the... - Full confession. - There you see? You see! But I get the pushing around! I'm the one who spends three days in this crummy jail! - Shut up! - Wait a minute. Are you disappointed? Did you want him to be guilty? Want him to be? He is. He broke into your house! Have you forgotten what he tried with you? I'll keep him here until he rots! That's what you say. Do you know what you've done to her? Stop it! What are you doing? Do you want revenge? I don't. All I want is my job back and for things to be as they were. I'm not going to press charges. Let him go. - Let him- - Yes. Let him go. Okay, kid. Beat it. Leonard, wait. Don't you think you ought to take him home? - Take him home? - I don't need anybody. Be quiet. What's the matter with you? You know it's late at night. You didn't even ask him if he has bus fare. We're miles from his house. - I can hitch a ride. - That's all you need. You've just gotten out of trouble. Take him home. Why do I always get stuck with the nutty ones? Come on, I'll drop you off on the way. Okay, kid. Go. Graham: Be right back, Bob. - Oh! - What's the matter? Oh, it's my key. I... It's here somewhere. Oh, here it is. - That's enough. - It's only the beginning. I know. That's what I mean. You have another stop to make and you look dead for sleep. - One for the road. Okay? - Okay. Out. When I picked you up today, you said you were gonna have yourself a good cry. How do you feel now? I don't feel like crying. That's all over. Go. What's on your mind, kid? There's something about her that gets under your skin. I mean... Well, who else after you've played her a lousy trick would, would worry about you getting a lift home? Do you understand what I mean? Right. Okay. I sent her those notes. And you made a pass at her in the stadium? And the burglary in her house? Just the way she said. Everything was just the way she said. - Let me out here, will you? - What for? I want to walk. I'll walk home. Come on back with me and tell her all this. No. No more tonight, please. I just want to walk home. Okay, kid. Pull over, Bob. Bob: Alright, sir. Operator. Operator. Oh, please, operator! Operator. Put that down! You won't call the police! You won't call the police! You won't, you won't. You don't have to call anyone. You don't have to. I just came to talk to you about Leonard. Oh? Well, that's fine, Mr. Bennett. I believe you. But, now, you, you really must go. Bennett: That closet, I- I, I guess I just, I didn't know what I was doing. Lois: Yes, I- I understand. But we can talk about that tomorrow. It- it's very late, now, Mr. Bennett. Well, you won't talk about it to anyone else? You won't talk about it to anyone else? Oh, no. No, I won't talk about it to anybody else. Now, Mr. Bennett, you really should go home. Your boy is waiting for you. - They let him go? - Yes, they did. They- they let him go. They had to let him go. You've nothing on that boy? You're right. They had nothing on him. I'm glad. We didn't want to hurt you. It's just... Well, it's hard to explain. You're so close. You see, I'm kind of embarrassed. I'm not accustomed to, uh, standing in the dark close to a pretty young woman. You are very pretty. That perfume you're wearing is very exciting. Is very exciting. Get out of here! Who do you think you are? Talking to me like that? You're not in the classroom now. Browbeating a lot of helpless children. Yes, and getting away with it because they are helpless. And getting away with it outside the classroom too, because you're a woman. And you're just like every woman! You're dirty! You lie! And cheat! You ought to be wiped off the face of the Earth every one of you! Every one of you! You cheat! You cheat! Lois? Lois! Honey. Honey. Honey, are you... What are you doing here? Leonard! You're okay, kid? Yeah, I'm alright. - Hi. - Hi. - Oh! Thank you. - You're welcome. I just got this picture from your problem child. He says he'll complete basic training and his high school credits in another month. - Good. Oh... - Excuse me. - Oh, hi, Sandy. - Oh, hi. I guess if you love them, they grow up.
