[wind rushing eerily] NETFLIX PRESENTS - [insects chirring] - [owl hoots] [vehicle approaches] LOWER SILESIA, 1957 [door creaks open] [car idling] [baby wailing] [agitated breathing] [ominous music playing] [cries] [in Latin] O Lord, show us thy grace and destroy this evil seed forever and ever. [blade rasps] [dark, foreboding music playing] I'm sorry. [crying] [ominous music building] It's the militia! Drop it, you hear me? Step away from the baby or we'll fire! Oh God, you don't understand. [officer] Drop the knife! [gunshots] [music swells, trails off] 30 YEARS LATER [unsettling, mysterious music playing] [dog barking in distance] [dog baying] [music warbling dissonantly] [match rasps] [haunting music playing] [caws] - Praise be to Jesus Christ. - Now and forever, amen. - Father Marek. - I know, I know. We've been expecting you. Do come in. This way. [door creaks] [door locks] [monk] I'm happy, so very happy that you've been assigned here to us. It's hard to find an exorcist these days. At least, one who's willing... One who'd serve God in the middle of nowhere. Especially since we're the only sanatorium like this in Poland. - Sanatorium? - Sanatorium. That's what we call it. After all, here, we heal the tormented. This is Brother Dawid. Our resident jack of all trades. God bless. Habit. Thank you, Brother. Rosary beads. Uh, I've brought my own, if that's not a problem. And we're also going to need to search your luggage. Of course. Standard procedure here at the sanitorium. For all newcomers and visitors. You understand. It's so no one from the outside brings in anything that might disrupt the harmony of our existence. [Marek] Mmm. And do you get many visitors? Visiting time is once a year on Christmas. But nobody really ever comes here. You know, the outside world is eager to forget those who are suffering. Besides... more often than not, they have nobody, so they're most vulnerable. Cigarettes. I'm sorry, but we'll have to take those, all right? [unsettling music continuing] There's no electricity or phones, but you'll be comfortable here, Father. Bathroom's over there. Oh, and one more thing. [clears throat] We don't generally leave our rooms after dark. Everyone should remain in their quarters. I think now I've got it all. Thank you, Prior. Father, it's good you came. The Evil One... He manifests his presence here in these walls. All the time, in fact. It won't be easy, but... I've a hunch that this may be your calling. Well, I guess there's a reason I'm here. That's right. [door closes heavily] [unsettling music continuing] ANOTHER WOMAN GOES MISSING [bell tolling] Oh, almighty God, your son, he promised the disciples who united in his name that he'd stay among them. Bless both us and this food that we are about to eat, and show us your grace by supporting our monastic family here on our daily path towards your life. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. [disturbing music playing] [sniffs] [water sloshes] [distressed wailing in distance] Eat. [wailing continues in distance] [distressing music builds] [low rumbling] [rumbling, clattering intensify] [man wailing in distance] Can you tell me, Father, how many hours elapsed between Judas' betrayal and Peter's third denial of Jesus? Six. That's why the time of exorcism is so significant. Satan has mocked the Creator so many times that one must know him well to know when he is weakest. It was at 6:00 a.m. when the apostle denied Jesus and Satan thought he'd beaten God. That's right. [wailing, screaming continue in distance] We record all of our exorcisms so that nothing escapes us. Some cases we find are very complex. Sometimes it even comes to... Well, things happen. [sinister music playing] [sinister music continuing] [door hinge creaking] [door locks] Soon it'll be okay. We'll help you. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I command you, Satan, to depart from this innocent soul. [unsettling music continuing] [in Latin] In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Holy Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do you, O Prince of the heavenly host, cast Satan and all evil spirits, who wander through the world seeking the ruin of souls, into hell by the power of God.

[continues praying in Latin] [woman wailing, groaning] [shrieks] [prior in English] Crucifix! [continues praying in Latin] [woman snarling, wailing] [disturbing music intensifies] [continues praying in Latin] [horrifying music playing] [music trails off] [mirror shatters] [hinge creaking] [low, guttural growling] [mysterious clattering] [gurgling, rustling] [suspenseful music playing] [Dawid] Can I help you, Father? [Marek] What's in there? The prior's office. You can't enter unless the prior invites you. Mmm, of course. [bell tolling] [inhales sharply] [ominous music playing] [retching] [wet rustling] [pop] [foreboding music playing] [cracking] [fly buzzing] [music intensifies] [panting] [lock tumbling, clicking] [foreboding music plays] [creaking, thumping] [wall clatters] [suspenseful music playing] [clattering] [bed frame clatters] Fuck. [door opening in distance] [footsteps approaching] [footsteps receding] [suspenseful music continuing] [machinery clanking, whirring] [wind rushing] [suspenseful music continuing] [prior] Grace and peace from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, be with you all. Now and forever, and unto the ages of ages. [brothers] Amen. And leading our penitential act this time... Brother Marek. [tense music playing] Brethren... let us acknowledge our sins, and so prepare to celebrate the sacred mysteries... In Latin, please, Brother. [clears throat] [haltingly] Fratres... Agnoscamus... peccata nostra... Peccata nostra... "Ut apti simus"... [solemn choral vocalizations] Ut apti simus... [exhales] That's enough. Let Brother Piotr finish. [in Latin] Brethren, let us acknowledge our sins, and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. [brothers] I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers, that I have greatly sinned, in my thoughts, and in my words, in what I have done, and in what I have failed to do. Through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. [ominous music plays] [unexpected crunching] [gags, coughs] [suspenseful music plays] [wailing] [wailing continues] [chilling music playing] Marek, go to the church and wait for me in the confessional. [wailing continues in distance] [footsteps approaching] [confessional door opens] [Piotr] They're watching you. Your every step. They know that you're here looking for something. You're playing with fire, 'cause in here any insubordination is met with brutal punishment. I learned this the hard way, because I tried to escape and they caught me. There's no getting out. It's a one-way ticket. You have to follow orders and keep your head down. Don't snoop around or ask questions. This isn't a normal monastery. [Piotr breathes shakily] I... I had to tell you. I've gotta go. If they catch us here, it'd be over for me. [Marek] Wait. I'm not a priest. I'm militia. - What? - Eight women went missing in this area. The station got an anonymous tip that they all were sent here 'cause they were possessed, but none came back. The militia can't run a normal investigation. After Father Popiełuszko, they don't want to meddle in church affairs, so they sent me in disguise. I saw the tape recordings. All those possessions and exorcisms... They're a scam, right? Mmm, yeah. The prior fakes the possessions using different tricks. That way he milks the Curia and the Vatican for money. The more excising we do, the better. Then he claims all the women went insane and died during their exorcisms. What do they really do to these women? No idea. Maybe they drug them. You saw her, that last girl. What happened when they exorcised her. Later, they bury them in the little graveyard in the courtyard. Will you get us out? I will. When? When I finish what I started. Just be careful. They see everything. [ominous music playing] [wet rustling] [wet squelching] [fleshy crunching] [jarring stinger] [retching] [gagging] [shuddering gasps] [buzzing] [buzzing intensifies] [door clattering] [horrifying shriek] [chilling music plays] [music intensifies, subsides] [bird trilling] [tense music playing] [creaks] [birds trilling] [wolf howling in distance] [grunting] [jarring stinger] [bird cawing] [inhales blearily] What now? Huh? Ah, fuck... [ragged breathing] [menacing music playing] [door opens] [door closes] I had sincerely hoped that our collaboration would've gone smoothly. But I'm sad to say I'm very disappointed in you, Father. Never mind. Let's just hope you're hungry. [in Latin] In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. [in English] What the fuck do you want? [gagging] [stifled retching] [music continues] [muffled gagging] There's no point in trying to resist. You're going to eat it all. All four portions. What for? Medicinal purposes. [gagging] [music intensifies] [Marek wails] [tense music playing] [jarring stinger] [suspenseful music playing] [Dawid growling] [Marek grunts] [Dawid growling] [muffled gunshot] [water droplets leaking] [gags] [flies buzzing] [wet palpations] [dissonant, horrifying music playing] [startled yelp] It's me. Easy, it's me. Jesus, they did a number on you. [Marek breathing raggedly] Oh God... Dear Lord... They've really done it. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Stop! Just wait. Hold on. I was trying to find you. - I need to show you something. - I've already seen enough. No. You haven't. It's important. It's something to do... with you. And with this... You need to see it. Please. [eerie music playing] Look right here. [speaking Latin] "The eclipse marks the birth of The Chosen One." [speaking Latin] He has to be slain right after being born. They describe a ritual within. A dagger. And a prayer. If he isn't slain after birth, then... the Chosen One will devour seven sinners and drink the blood of an innocent. And then... [speaking Latin] "When the ritual is complete, the Chosen One will become a demon and the world as we know it will end." Get it? They think you're the Chosen One. They're completing the ritual. Hey. What's this book? It's a thousand years old, at least. [chilling music plays] You know that sign. I knew it. All of it fits. I'm a militia officer, not some backwater fairy tale dragon! I know that. But they're fanatics! They won't listen to reason. They killed those women. They'll kill us both. Now you know everything. I know how to escape. There's a hidden passage underground. Come on. An underground passage? A tunnel that leads outside the monastery. Follow me. It was my escape plan when they caught me last time. Look what they did to me. [menacing music playing] Please trust me. Let's get out of here. Lead the way. The flashlight. I didn't plan it well back then. [clattering in distance] [squeaking] [blow landing] [Marek grunting] [malevolent music playing] I fucking knew it. [prior] Marek. Marek. [muffled struggling] You almost got away. But in the end, my will prevailed. You see, you didn't end up here by chance. I brought you to us. A few anonymous tips, a couple of bribes, and you got the case of the missing women. Sorry for deceiving you, but we had to. After all, you wouldn't take part in this of your own free will, would you? You, an officer of the Citizen's Militia, would surely never have believed our good intentions. It might not be obvious upon first glance, but we really do mean well. [whimpering] God and the Devil sit side by side. They have an understanding. Forever. Since the start. But the Devil isn't evil. Humans are. They've deserved punishment for a long time. And punished they shall be. That well is a gateway to Hell. That's why our monastery was built here. For 800 years, our brotherhood has waited for you. The Chosen One. Once we complete the ritual, the Evil One will enter your body and a new order on Earth will commence. He will reign supreme. And we shall be his apostles, helping him to run a new, better world. There's only one thing missing. One final element. The blood of an innocent. [sinister music playing] [sinister music continues] Leave her alone, you fucker! No! No! [blood splattering] [woman gagging] No! No... [woman continues gagging] This is the moment. The most important one of all time. [Marek whimpering] [weakly] And forgive us our trespasses, and lead us into... [whimpers] ...and deliver us from evil. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace... [blood splattering] [shudders, moans] [in Latin] Come to us, Lord. Come to us, Lord. Come to us, Lord. Come to us, Lord. [sinister music intensifies] Come to us, Lord? Come to us, Lord. Come to us, Lord. Come to us, Lord. [despondent chuckle] [Marek cackling weakly] [in English] Did we forget something? Maybe we missed a step. Well... I don't know. I doubt it. There aren't any instructions. Just some notes from 800 years ago. Perhaps he was meant to eat the sinners whole, and we interpreted it in a way that... In a way that was symbolic. Impossible. And there were seven of them. A cardinal sin per woman. The eighth one was a virgin too. And he's the Chosen One. All of it adds up. You said this would work. You're blaming me for this? No, I'm not. What should we do then? Brothers! Brothers... Perhaps... Perhaps this whole thing... was a mistake on our part. [brother] So now what? [Piotr] Let's all go to our rooms. We'll meet tomorrow, like nothing happened. We meant well. We're in this together. No need for concern. Everything can be... explained. Except for him. Fuck. They'll be looking for this guy. I'm sorry it has come to this. [blade rasps] [low, disturbing music playing] Antoni, untie him. Throw him in the well. - [Marek's body thuds] - Go back to your rooms, brothers.

Sit down. [ominous music playing] You see, Piotr? I was supposed to be the Devil's apostle, and fuck all happened. Oh, yeah. I know. You're a loyal sub-prior. An excellent deputy. [prior snoring] I know. [sinister music swells] [prior choking, gasping] [muffled struggling] [music intensifies] [muffled screaming] [muffled screaming continues] [muffled screaming stops] [brother] Brother Antoni! What happened? I came to get him, 'cause I was worried. I found him like this when I came in. [Piotr sniveling] Sweet Lord... Last night, I should've stayed with him. He wasn't young. It's not your fault, okay? Piotr, come. Now... you will take over his duties. I know. [brother] Who'll notify the Curia? [Piotr] I will.
