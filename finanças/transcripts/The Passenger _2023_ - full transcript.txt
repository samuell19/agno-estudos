...outside the wild card, but a win today against Washington could put them back in position, so we're-- Hey, Benson. Hey. Do you know who's working today? Oh. All right. Time to wake up and act like you give a shit. No, I don't... Benson, you are cleaning the dining room today. Jess will be on drive-through. Bradley, front window. Chris, you're in the kitchen with me. Mm. Chris? Chris? W... What? I'm talking to you is what. Get your dick out of your ear and listen when I'm talking. All right? Your work's been shit lately. For fuck's sake, there's still... there's still food under the heat lamp from you closing last night. My bad. Yeah, it is your bad. It sure is. It's also fucking unsanitary and it's fucking disgusting. Right? Meeting adjourned. Let's get it started. Business as usual, all right? Move, move, move. Bradley. Hey. Hang tight. Come see. I want to talk to you. My office. Sit down. Just... Uh... What's your last name, Bradley? It's Bradley. What? Uh. Bradley's my last name. Then what's your first name? Randy. How come your name tag says "Bradley"? Mm. Well, you gave it to me. Huh. All right, listen, Bradley. You've been here, what, a year now? Uh. Yeah, I guess so. You like it? Sure. Yeah. What are your... plans for the future? What do you mean? What do you want to do? Um... I don't kn-- You taking any classes now? Uh. Community college, something like that? Not really, no. Okay. Right. Fuck it. Look, these pricks here, they don't give two shits about what we do. All right? But I see you, and you don't fit in. You do what I say. You don't talk back. You do shit around here I wouldn't even do. So let me ask you... Why do you work so fucking hard at this job? I-- I... I don't... I don't know. Look. I got some scoop on a new spot opening up west of Reading. They're gonna be opening some manager positions. I could put in a good word for you. This... this is not some charity bullshit, okay? I recommend someone halfway decent, it makes me look good. I recommend some fuckup that loses their shit, quits after two months, I get reamed up the ass. Know what I'm saying? Okay. Yeah. So... I need to know what you want to do. Oh, um... W-- Well, I guess-- I don't need an answer right now. - Yeah? - Yeah. Think it over. - Got it? - Yeah. All right. All right, go ahead. Thank you. - Close the goddamn door. - Sorry. What are you up to back there, huh? Sucking Hardy's dick? Wasn't talking about me, was he? Mm-mm. I swear. Good to hear. If you're lying... you're dead. Yeah, can I get a large Double meal with a side of pussy, please? A large side of pussy with some pussy nuggets. - "Pussy nuggets"? - And sweet and sour sauce. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. I said some pussy. Oh, yeah? Pussy... Pussy, pussy. Give me some pussy! Give me some pussy! Hey. Hey, could you-- Could you cut that out? - What'd you say? - It's just-- What, Bradley? It's just-- - Why do you fucking care? - Yeah. What is it? It's just a little disrespectful. That's all. Mr. Chivalry here thinks it's disrespectful. I'm gonna say "pussy" whenever I feel like saying "pussy." Don't give me a fucking sermon about something you haven't even seen firsthand. - I... I didn't mean... - Oh, no. What's got you all high and mighty? Got a new girlfriend? Huh? Does he have a new girlfriend? I doubt it. No, that can't be it. No. Boyfriend? Come on, Bradley, tell me what's on your mind. Did you ask a girl out and she turned you down? Told you she'd never fuck a loser like you? Can you please just knock it off? Sure, buddy. I'll knock it off. Okay. If you do me this favor. Hmm? Ew. Eat this burger, and then I'll shut up. Come on. Eat the burger. Then you won't hear shit the rest of the day. Chris. Hmm? Stop. What? You should stop now. Chris, don't. Benson. Why do you fucking care? Because you made your point. You made it a while ago. And now you're just being a dick. I've never had a problem with you. But if you try to tell me what I can and cannot fucking do, I will have no problem turning your peaceful redneck existence into a living hell. Do we understand each other? Sure. Good to hear. Now, where were we? Come on, you know what to do. Oh, my God. Hmm. Swallow. So weird. The fuck you waiting for? Take another one. Oh, my God. Come on. - More, more, more. - How's that taste? It's a... Okay. - See? - That's gross. Come on. - What a guy. - Come on, let's go. Good job, Bradley. Let's do it in the freezer today. Chris, no. There's still a rash on my ass from last time. Hey, where were you, buddy? What the f... What the fuck is go... Stop! What are you planning on doing back there, Hardy? Please don't... don't... don't do this. Hey. Shit. Shut the fuck up! Help me move these two to the back. Bradley, don't make me do some "count to ten" bullshit. Look at this fucking mess. Take a leg. Fuck. Fucking move. Goddamn. Where's your phone? In my jacket. Go. Walk. Move all that shit out the front seat. Bradley, I could've killed you a hundred times by now. Will you get in the fucking car? Jesus Christ. I know what you're thinking, Bradley. I've already done the math. Next shift starts at 2:00. It's 8:30 now. That's five and a half hours before anybody gets inside. That is assuming, of course, some potential customer doesn't fucking freak 'cause they can't get their curly fry fix, they break a window or some shit. So chances are, five and a half hours before anybody steps inside. Now, if we're lucky, it's gonna be fucking Donnie. You know, he'll take it as a blessing, sees the store's closed, he's gonna take his ass home. But if it's Carla, then she may know that something's up. She may call headquarters, may call the cops. But I'm thinking... still gonna be like at least an hour before they figure out what's in the freezer, then another hour for them to clean the shit out of their pants and... figure out what to do about a triple homicide in a town of 10,000 people. So that's at least... seven hours from now. Seven hours. Man, who knows where we're gonna be in seven hours? You hungry? Let's get something to eat. Put that on. Take a seat. Here you go. Thank you. - This uh... egg dish? - Mm-hmm? What is that? Oh, that's the specialty. All righty... Benson. Benson. Why are we here? Hmm? Wh... why... Why are... are you doing this? What do you mean? Oh, you mean like... Wondering when you were gonna ask me that. What can I get for you gentlemen this fine morning? Well... Marsha... Marsha, Marsha, Marsha, uh, I got a question for you. Does the short stack come with hash browns? No, just toast. That's a shame. But the omelets do? Correct, sir. Okay. Well, then it's gonna be a, uh, western omelet kind of morning for me. And for Mister... Bradley, what is your last name? It's Bradley. Your name is "Bradley Bradley"? No, my last-- My first name is Randy. Randy? Well, two first names, that's really special. It's very special, Randy. Uh. What are you eating? Um... I'm fine, thanks. You know what, let's just get him a cinnamon bun. He can snack on that. Western omelet, cinnamon bun. Coming right up. Thanks. Actually, you know what? Hold up. I got another question for you, Marsha. Shoot. How long have you worked here? 'Bout six years now. And in the dining industry overall? Guessing 19, maybe 20 years. Right. - Long time, huh? - It is a long time. You lived around here your whole life? Why, as a matter of fact, I have. You got any kids? Yes. Two boys. Eighteen and twenty-two. When's the last time you talked to them? Well... You got a husband? Well, that's just-- When was the last time you've done something, Marsha? I-- Like, really done something. Something that mattered. Nothing springs to mind? I'm going to go place your order. Okay. Good chat, Marsh. Don't look at me like that. You think that affected her life in any way? What about me? What about you what? What does this have to do with me? You mean why are you here right now? Because, Randy, I have been watching you, and I know for a fact that you are better than this shit. You have a full-sized, honest-to-God, functioning human brain. And yet, today, I watched you eat a day-old cheeseburger because a walking dick with arms fucking told you to. You are twenty years old, and you are already more pathetic than every person in this godforsaken town, and that bugs the living shit out of me. But there's something about you. Hmm? There's something fixable. And I believe that. I mean, hell, when you were standing there... watching me, waiting for me to kill you. That was the only thing I believed. Does that answer your question? Thanks, Marsha. So, what now, then? I'm gonna eat my omelet is "What now then?" What the fuck are you doing? Let's go. I'm actually twenty-one. What? Before, you said I was twenty, but I'm actually twenty-one. So, how long you been out of high school? What is it, like three years? Two. I got held back a year. When? Second grade. Shut the fuck up. What? What do you mean, "What?" How the fuck do you fail second grade? Uh. I... I didn't fail. I just got held back. For what? What'd you do? You colored outside the lines? My mom just didn't think that I was ready. Sounds like a crock of bullshit to me, Randy. Yeah, maybe. No, fucking definitely. That's some over-parenting bullshit. You need to stand up for yourself. Don't let them decide what's right for you. Well, I was only seven. Still. Bring that. This way. Let's go. Hey, Ma. I'll be right back. Hey. Give me that. I got you some breakfast. Thank you. Benny, did you get me some cigarettes? No, Ma, I forgot your cigarettes. Benny, I asked you before you left. Yeah, well, you know... ...you can always get 'em yourself, Ma. Benny, you know I can't get my cigarettes-- Here's some fucking cigarettes. Eat your breakfast. Don't touch anything. I'll be right back. Who are you? Uh. I'm... I'm... I'm a friend. F... from work. What's all over your shirt? Um... It's ketchup. I-- I-- I spilled a big... big thing of ketchup at work. Doesn't look like ketchup. Well, it's... it's just dried now. It's from a while ago. Doesn't look like ketchup. Phone. Hmm? Hand me the phone. I need to make a call. Okay. Okay. Come on now. Hand me the damn phone. Give me the phone. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck did I say to you? What the fuck did I say to you? I said don't fucking touch anything. - You think I'm fucking with you? - I'm just-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. She... she... she wanted the phone. She said she needed to call somebody. Who the fuck do you need to call? I want to call someone. Shit. Fucking no phone calls! Put 'em on. I just wanted to make a damn phone call, Benny. Come on. Walk. Randy, I think I may have been sending you some mixed messages. I think that when I talked to you about making your own decisions, you may have taken that as a call to action. And maybe it was. And maybe that's my fault. But there's certain decisions... Certain decisions that are bad decisions. Stupid decisions. And... and they put me in a difficult position. They put me in a bind. Because it forces me to hurt you... ...when what I really want to do is help you. You believe me, don't you? Because I really fucking do. So let's just forget about everything that happened. We'll forget about everything in that house, and from now on, the rest of today is about you. And if I'm gonna help you... like, really help you... ...then I can't have you getting in my way. I need you to work with me, not against me. Okay? So, we square? Yeah. We're square. Super. Oh, fuck, man. Let me ask you something. That stuff Chris was saying about you not having a girlfriend. Is that true? Uh. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. Are you gay? No, I'm not gay. You a virgin? Uh... - Yeah. - That's good. It is? Yeah, definitely. Look, you start having sex, there's a chance that whoever you're fucking is gonna get pregnant. Then some poor kid's gonna be stuck with you as a father. Now, that's nothing personal. Too many guys start fucking too early, they end up with kids they don't want. Those kids grow up, and they find out they only exist because they had horny teenage parents. They start doing crack, they join a cult, or worse, they start having their own unprotected sex. I'm beginning to think that most of today's problems are a direct result from the fact that teenagers can't stop themselves from fucking each other. So, really, you're doing the world a favor. Yeah. I guess so. You ever had one? A girlfriend? Uh. Yeah, yeah, I... I had one. It was a couple years ago. What was her name? Lisa. Lisa, like the Simpson. What happened? Her... her cat died. What do you mean? Her cat died, and then we just sort of stopped dating after that. Because her cat died? Yeah. Or... kind of. What-- What are you-- What are you saying to me? What are you trying to say? Like, you're saying she said, "I can't date you because my cat died"? No, - I didn't-- - Then what the fuck did she say? We never really talked about it after. But you were never like, "Hey, you remember that time you broke up with me because of your fucking cat?" No, not really. This is, like, unbelievable! Randy, no! Wait, where are we... where are we going now? I need cigarettes. That is unbelievable. Let's go! You know, I saw you eyeballing the gun when that pig drove by. I need you to remember what we talked about. I remember. Do you? 'Cause I'm not so sure. Top that off. I'm gonna go pay inside. Get in the car. I got an idea. So, this Lisa... ...you said she works at the mall? Yeah. Think she's working today? I don't-- Uh. I don't know. Maybe, yeah. Sometimes, she works on the weekends. Then that's where we're going. Really? Yes. Yes! Fuck yes! Okay... We're gonna go meet Lisa. Look, this... This makes so much sense. We got to... You got to go and talk to this Lisa... figure out what her deal is, figure out why she dumped you... I-- I-- ...and then, you know, you can go, you can make up... I-- ...you can become best friends, you can punch her in the fucking face. Okay, but you-- I don't care, but it is imperative that you talk to her, because this is gonna help you figure out your shit. Okay, um, but she-- Well, she might not-- W... what if she's not there? Don't cross bridges before you get to 'em, Randy. Hello? Is anyone here? Just a second. Hey, how can I... Randy. Lisa, hi. Uh. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Oh, I'm good. Yeah. Since when do you listen to Motörhead? Uh. I don't know. Just recently. Really? Yeah. I-- I-- I like their, um... I really like their music. Okay. So... ...what's up? Well, uh, you know, I was just stopping by, and I was actually kinda wondering if we could talk for a bit. Oh. Now's not really a good time. Um, I know it looks dead in here, but, uh, I've got a party of second graders in an hour, so... Uh. Well, it... it... it wouldn't... It wouldn't be that long. I'm sorry, but I'm... I'm working. I'm here to help customers. Well, we can be customers. You want to decorate stuffed animals? Yeah. Sure. If you talk to me while I do it. - Which one? Uh. T-- What? Which stuffed animal do you want to decorate? Oh. Um... Uh. Uh. I... How about the, um... crocodile? You want one, too? Let me get a giraffe. Okay. Let me go get them from the back. Excuse me. You're gonna be a good boy, right, Randy? Randy, this is fucking weird. Yeah, I guess it kind of is. You want to tell me what's going on? Yeah. Um... I was wondering... I was wondering why you broke up with me after Oreo died. This is what you wanted to talk to me about? Well, we never really talked about it. No, I guess we didn't. So... It wasn't that I cared so much about Oreo. I mean, I did, but... I... I wanted you to care about him. Or I guess I wanted you to care about the fact I cared about him. I wanted you to care about something, Randy. I... I had no idea whether you liked anything. You were always so closed off. We... we never talked about what you wanted to do or how you felt about your family or your friends. We never even talked about what happened to you in second grade. Look, I... I know it was unfair of me to just walk away like that, but... ...you didn't even try to chase after me. Kind of just assumed it didn't matter to you. Well, it did. Listen, Randy. I appreciate you coming here, really. I think it's good that... that you're trying to change things up, but... this just doesn't seem like the right way to do it. I don't get this. And I really don't get him. Yeah, I guess I'm just kind of in a weird place right now. No kidding. You're spending your Saturday gluing sequins on a crocodile. How's it going? Oh, look at you. Fucking Picasso. That's pretty good, Randy. What are you doing later? Uh... I just started my shift, so... So, like, if we came back later tonight, you might still be here? Uh, we should probably get going. Right? Before all those kids show up? Right, the kids. Got the, uh, kids coming. Right. You keep up the good work, huh? Come on, Randy. Uh, see you later, Randy. Let's go. Um... Yeah, I'll... see you. I'm sure she's a lovely girl, Randy, but honestly, I don't think she's worth the fuss. Why not? Well, for starters, she works in a shopping mall. Well, what's wrong with shopping malls? Oh, I don't know. They're just the embodiment of corporate greed and everything else that's fucked-up in the world. Well, we work in fast food. Isn't that, like, the same thing? No, it's not. People go to fast food places 'cause they need something to eat. A mall serves absolutely no purpose. They just lump together every form of consumption into one giant, glittering, air-conditioned asshole. Besides, I don't work in fast food anymore. What the fuck is that? That's my cell phone. Says "Mom." Yeah, uh, I should answer that. I don't think that's a good idea. No, I promise it'll be much worse if I don't. Okay. Now make it quick. What? Just, it's for precaution. Mm. Hi, Mom. That was four rings before picking up, Randy. Is something wrong? Uh, no, Mom. - Are you avoiding me? - Of course not, Mom. Uh. It just took me a second. Where are you? It sounds like you're outside somewhere. No, I'm... Well, yes, I'm-- I'm outside of the mall. - I'm... I'm with a friend. - Why are you at the mall? He-- He just-- He-- He-- He wanted me to help him pick out some stuff. Well, you've been out of work for a while. When were you planning on telling me this? I was just about to call you. Do I know this friend? What's his name? Hi... his... his name is Benson. You... You don't know him but he's a nice guy. Try not to be too long. End the call. Okay, well, listen, Mom, I... I should probably-- - End the call. - Don't forget, we need you to come home for dinner. We're hosting Haley's dance team tonight. Uh. Right, right. Okay, yeah, I-- Hang up the phone. - I have to go. - And I need you to wear that white button-down shirt that I left out for you. Okay. Bye, Mom. Is she always like that? Yeah, pretty much. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you, Randy, but you're never gonna figure it out if your mom's dragging you around by your dick all day. She's a little too involved... ...in how you make decisions. Yeah. Guess so. I mean, she held you back in second grade for Christ's sake. Who the fuck does that? Yeah. It's just micromanaging bullshit. Listen, you're a fucking adult, Randy. You need to have a little self-respect. Well, there's something I should tell you. What? About when I got held back. It wasn't just 'cause of my mom. What do you mean? Um, there was, um... there was an incident. An incident? Yeah. Um... What, like a fire? No, not exactly. What the fuck are you talking about, then? I had this teacher. Miss Beard. And she was, like, this... Everyone loved her. I mean, I loved her. Only, there was this game we would play. Um... it was a... You know when you're, like, kicking field goals but you're using your fingers? Yeah. And... and the football's an eraser? Well, we used to do it with a... with a folded-up piece of paper, but yeah. Right. Well, we did it with erasers. Okay. And like I said, w... we'd all play it, and, um... it got really disruptive, I guess, and one day, Miss Beard had just had it with us and... I was the one she caught doing it, and so... she yelled. And something about it just made me so angry because... I was being singled out even though we'd all done it. It just seemed so unfair, and I... I... I'd never-- Sure. I'd never felt that angry before. Yeah. And so I... I took the eraser, and I put it to the end of this stupid plastic ruler, and I pulled it back like it was a catapult, and I shot it, and it went flying through the air. It was, like, I'd never seen something fly so fast. Um. And it hit her in the eye. Like, right in the eye. You knocked out your teacher's eye? No, I didn't... It didn't knock it out. It just... There was, um... Apparently, there were some bits of lead... still on the eraser and... and they got stuck in her eye, and they had to remove it. So you knocked out your teacher's eye? I wasn't trying to. Oh, my God. My God! Well, it gets worse. How... How the fuck does it get worse than you knocking out your teacher's eye? Well, when she came back, she had... she had to wear an eye patch and-- And all the kids started calling her Blackbeard. - They wouldn't just-- - That's fucking incredible. They wouldn't stop. They wouldn't stop. And... and then all the other teachers started calling her Blackbeard behind her back. Like, her life totally fell apart. And... and... and then we heard she wouldn't even, like, leave the house. And then after that, she took a leave of absence. And so my mom... she decided it might be best for me if... ...if I took second grade all over again. That's pretty fucked-up. Yeah. It is. Yeah. What's she do now? I think she's back to teaching. You really fucked up her life, huh? Yeah, I guess I did. God, hey. Hey. Hey. Come on. It was an accident. Forget about it. It's not the kind of thing you just forget. And besides, it wasn't an accident. You're seven years old, Randy. You're not trying to take your teacher's eye out. No, listen, Miss Beard was... she was... she was special. - Randy. - And because of me, her life was ruined. You know why I let Chris walk all over me? Why I ate that cheeseburger today? Because nothing good comes from me making my own decisions. The one time I let myself react the way I wanted to, I ruined a person's life. So... yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe I'm a waste of space. But at least I don't get in the way of other... people trying to be happy. So, there you go. You said she still works at your old elementary school? Benson, we don't need to do this. It's not like... Benson. Benson. I'm telling you, we... we can't do this. I don't see why not. Well, it's Saturday. No one's even here. Relax. We're just gonna check it out. Okay, wait. Benson, please, please-- No! Cool your jets, Randy. You-- You can't just m... mess with other people's lives. I'm not messing with anybody. I'm doing this for your own good. You say nothing good comes from you ever reacting? Well, how about never reacting at all? - Do you think that's safer? - Mm-hmm. Because it's not. Let me show you. Do you see what happens when you do nothing? Now, I've spent all day listening to you come up with excuse after excuse for being the sad little person that you are. And now we're gonna do something about it. We're gonna find this fucking cyclops teacher of yours, and we're gonna see if she's really worth you throwing your entire life away over. Please don't do this. We're already here. We've come all this way, and there is no way that I am leaving... ...until I see a woman with an eye patch. Let's go. - May I help you? - Yes. Uh, we were wondering... does Miss Patricia Beard still work here? Yes, she does. Wonderful. She wouldn't happen to be here today, would she? Well, n... no, gentlemen. It's Saturday. We really only have the janitorial staff and a few administrators that pop in. Yeah, of course. Of course. That makes sense. Um. Well, then you wouldn't be able to give us her address, would you? I'm sorry, but who exactly am I speaking with? Oh. We're, um-- We're former students. We're just looking to get in touch with her. Well, it's really not within my discretion to provide you with our faculty's personal information. And I totally get that. I do. I totally get it. Um, listen, this is-- I'm sorry, but I can't. No, I... I understand. This is a very special situation. You see, this... ...is Randy Bradley. Hi. Come on, miss. You've worked here long enough, right? The Randy Bradley, with the... Oh. Yeah. Well, I... I don't know. Look, we're moving to the city tomorrow, and Randy here, he was just... Well, he was hoping to have a chance to pay his respects before we took off. Please, miss, it's a small favor. But it would mean a lot. Well... All right. I suppose I can make an exception. Thank you. Let's see. Let's see. Carol, I left the schedule on my desk. Of course, Mr. Sheppard. Have a good evening. I'll see you on Monday. Mr. Sheppard. Yes? - Elliot Sheppard? - Yes, that's right. You used to teach third grade at Central Elementary. Yes. Yes, I did. That's been quite a while ago. I'm sorry, uh, d... do I...? No. No, no, no, no. No, I just knew somebody who... who used to go there. Well... ...nice to meet you. I'll see you, Carol. Have a good night, Mr. Sheppard. 1737 Hazel Drive, Centerwood. It's just past the diner. Just follow Snowbank. Okay. Thank you. A... and, Mr. Bradley, I really think you're doing the right thing. Good for you. Stay. Hey, Sheppard. Wait. No. Stand up! Wait, Benson. Benson, Benson, no. - Don't. They'll hear. - Come on, Benson. Benson, you can't. You... Look, look, look. We have Miss Beard's address. We have to go find her. You... you said-- You said you were doing... doing this for me. You... you told me to... you told me to do something. We're doing something. Let's go! Randy! - That... that guy-- - You bring him up again, and I'll kill you. Things got fucked-up back there. You were right to intervene. You're learning, huh? Look, I told you I was doing this for you, and I meant it. So let's just forget about it, huh? Forget about him. Everything's cool. Everything's cool, right? Randy? Yeah. Definitely. Good. This is it? This is it. Do we really need... Quiet, Crisco. May I help you? It's a little late for visitors. Hi. W-- Uh, we... Uh, we... Uh. Hi. Randy? Randy Bradley, is that you? Yeah. Hi. Uh. H... How are you? I'm doing well, Randy. How are you? This is so unexpected. Uh, yeah, I guess it is. Sorry. No, there's no reason to apologize. Hello. This is Benson. Hi. So, what brings you out this way? Um... I, um... I wanted to, uh... I needed-- I'm sorry. Do you want to maybe come inside for a minute? - Okay. - Okay. Yeah. Be careful, the walls are still a little wet. You can have a seat if you want. I'm good. Can I use your restroom? Sure. It's right through there, just first door on the left. All right. Here you go. He's interesting. Yeah. Is he always so quiet? Not really. Are you feeling any better? Yeah. Thank you. I just wasn't expecting... I don't know what I was expecting. Well... I must say it's a bit of a shock for me, too. I don't normally get visits from former students. We were at the school before we came here. They had your address. I hope that's okay. Of course. Miss Beard... I know it's, um... too late for me to do anything about it, but, um, I just... I... I wanted to... I needed to tell you... how sorry I am for, um... about the... about what happened. I know it doesn't make it any better, but I've... felt absolutely terrible about it for a really... really long time and, um, if it was... Sorry. If there was, uh, some... some way I could, um... Uh, if I... Is that... My daughter. You have a daughter? Yes. Tessa. So... you're married? Divorced. She's at her dad's for the weekend. After the sabbatical... I traveled for a bit. Got involved with this guy. Wound up in a marriage that probably never should've been. When you get older, you'll see that such things tend to happen pretty easily if you let them. But I... I can't complain. If things hadn't happened the way they did, I wouldn't have her. Wow, that's, uh... I... I think I expected you to be less... Happy? Well... ...If you showed up here ten years ago, you might have found more of what you were expecting. After I lost the eye, I spent a lot of time being miserable. It took me a while to realize that I was actually pretty lucky that things happened the way they did. "Lucky"? Yeah. Of course, my life wasn't perfect. Mm. If all it took was for one bad thing to happen for me to lose my job, my coworkers, my fiancé, then none of those things were worth really having in the first place. And they all would've disappointed me eventually. Yeah, but weren't you h... happier before? Maybe I thought so at the time. But I wouldn't want to go back. The truth is... everyone gets hurt, Randy. Not everyone is ready for it. You know, I... I always wondered... ...if I would get a chance to see you again. You were such a sweet little kid. I was worried that whole... ...experience might have shook you up a bit. No. I... I guess I kind of always assumed you... ...hated me. For what happened? Of course not. It takes a lot of energy to hate a seven-year-old. Anyway, it was really brave of you to come see me. Most people wouldn't have. Let's go. Get up. Let's go. I'm sorry. I was just cleaning up, but if you'd like - some tea, there's-- - No, no. I'm good. I'm good. We're actually gonna get going. Oh. But you have to at least tell me how you know Randy here. Uh, we work together. Well, we used to work together. Randy's real sorry about your eye. He told you that, right? Yes, he did. Good. Can we go? Sorry, uh, let me just answer that, and then I'll see you two out. Hello? Hi, Carol. What? Wait. Slow down. Oh, my God, that's horrible. Uh, is he... Oh, God. Yeah, of course. I will. Has anyone called Susan? Everything okay? Uh. Someone just assaulted our... vice principal in the parking lot. Hmm. Is he alive? Apparently, he was when the ambulance got there, but... No, he didn't make it to the hospital. I can't believe it. Outside of a elementary school. Randy, you were just there. Did you hear anything about that? - Um-- - No. No, we didn't hear anything about it. Shit. No, no, Benson. No, no. Oh, my God. What are you doing? Put it away. - Shut up. - I don't understand. You can't kill her. Well, we can't fucking leave her here, can we? Look, Benson, please-- Hey! I am not getting caught on account of that fucking shit stain of an old man! Do you fucking understand me? This isn't what you want. You don't know me! You don't know what the fuck I want! You're the reason we fucking came here in the first place! This is your fucking fault! Okay, okay, fine, yes, it's my fault, but... We're here because you wanted to help me, Benson. Uh. How is-- How is killing her gonna help me? My daughter, her name is Tessa. Don't say her name. Shut up. - She's eight. - Don't say her name. She's about to have a birthday. Shut up! - Shut the fuck up! - I was gonna take her to... Will you shut this fucking dog up! Quiet, Crisco. Quiet, baby. Benson, you... you can't. Stop telling me what I can and can't do, Randy. Okay, let's go. Empty your pockets. Wait, wait, she's coming with us? Empty your fucking-- - She's coming with us. - Empty your pockets. Can't we just... Shut up! Where are you taking us? You're the one who attacked Elliot? Why would you do that? Will you shut the fuck up? But why are you-- Will you shut the fuck up? Just shut up! I was gonna fucking shoot you. You're lucky Randy here talked me out of it. Just shut the fuck up. You see, Randy here, he was my little experiment for the day. Right, Randy? And he had a few things that he needed to work out, and I was gonna help him with those things. Turns out that you're one of them. Now, if you want to know why this is happening... you can thank him. Benson. What, Randy? I... I need to use the bathroom. I can't help you, bro. I... I haven't gone all day. I kind of really need to go. Well, then look in the back seat! Find a soda bottle or some shit. I don't know. It's not a bottle situation, Benson. Of course it's not. Are you fucking serious? Benson. Can I go? I want my coffee first. You could just let us go, you know. You could leave right now, and no one would have to know that this happened. Stop talking. You don't want to make things worse for yourself by taking hostages. You have no idea what's really happening right now. I'm gonna get my food, I'm gonna get my coffee, and then I'm going to decide where we're going, and then we are going to go there, because I'm deciding. Not you. No more talking. Ready to order? Yeah. I'll take a coffee. And y'all? Well, what about food? Just give us another minute, will you? Sure thing. Can I go now? Please. You can see the bathroom right there. Two minutes. Go. 9-1-1. What is your emergency? I... Uh. There's... there's a situation at the Kutzburg Diner. What kind of situation, sir? What's wrong? There's a... there's a... a man with a gun. Is anyone hurt? Uh. No, no. Not yet. But there's a man with a gun? And he's dangerous? Well, he... he might... Uh. No, he... he's not necessarily gonna hurt anyone, so-- But he has a gun? And he's threatening people with the gun? Uh, no. Uh. Well, yes, he has a gun but he... Yeah, I'm... I'm in the bathroom right now. I have to go back out there. Please stay on the line if you can. What's the address? Uh, I don't... I don't know. It's the Kutzburg Diner. It's off of Route 100. Just come quick. Benson. What? I need to talk to you. We need another minute. You don't know me. You don't know me at all. And for you to insinuate that I've wasted my life or... or that I'm not a good mother is wrong. To say those things to someone you don't even know, that's wrong. Come on, Marsha. - It's time to head home. - No! I've sacrificed a lot in life. I have. For you to come in here and say those things is wrong. You're wrong. Leave these men alone. I want this man to leave! I don't want him served in this restaurant! Sweetheart. I'm not going! He's going! Take back what you said! Shut the fuck up! Back up! Back the fuck up! You, get the fuck out of here now! On the ground. On the ground! Don't fucking look at me! Get on the ground. I was making a fucking point. It had nothing to do with you. Do you fucking understand me? I don't give a fuck about your life! Benson. What? You have to stop. - What the f... What? - There's no... there's no point to what you're doing. You told me... Benson, you told me this woman would never do anything about what you said, and she just did, and you shot her for it. Are you fucking kidding me right now? You're doing this shit right now? You've got this whole fucked-up worldview, like you've got it all figured out, Benson, Fuck! But I've been sitting next to you all day, watching you drive around the same roads you've been driving around your whole life-- Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you to talk to me like this right now? After everything I've fucking done for you! Listen, Benson. I am fucking listening to you, Randy! No. Listen. Listen. Oh, shit. - Fuck. Okay. - What the f... Who called 'em? Who called 'em? Who the fuck called 'em?! Who called 'em? It was you. It was you, wasn't it? It was you, wasn't it, you fucking bitch? - You fucking bitch! - No, Benson, wai-- Randy. Oh, God. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Fuck. Fuck. Stupid. Get a fucking-- Get something! Okay. Shit! Goddamn it! Why the fuck did you do that, you fucking idiot? Here. Here. Fuck. Fuck, Randy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Fuck. Oh, fuck, fuck. I did it. I did it. I did it. I called the... cops. I called... I called the cops. I c... I called the cops. It was me. It was me. You're still in charge, Benson. You know, when I was a kid... ...I went to the zoo on a class trip. And when I came home... I decided I wanted to be a giraffe when I grew up. Hmm. I was never in charge, Randy. Benson. - Hands up! - Get on the ground! - Get on the fucking ground now! - Get your hands up now! - Gun! Gun! Gun! - Gun! Gun! Do not move! Stay right there. Do not move your fucking hands! Okay, don't move. Now you're just playing with the eraser. Flick it right through. - Like this? - Yeah. Nice. That was... that was pretty impressive, I must say. Give it a really good flick. - That was a really good flick. - I'm home. Mom! Hi, baby. Can you help me put this away in the kitchen? Yeah. Just a second. Hi, Mom. Hi. Randy. Hey, how's-- It's fine, Mom. I'm just, uh... just finishing up. I was just, um... Will you be home for dinner? Uh. I told you, Mom, I'm meeting friends. Okay, then. Uh, sounds... sounds good. All right, then. I'll see you tonight, Mom. I love you. I love you. Bye. Here you go. Are you sure you're good for next Tuesday? Yep. I'll be here. Okay. - Bye, Randy. - Bye. Uh, hey, Miss Beard. Yes? Thanks for... Thank you. You too. Okay. So... if you can do a good job cleaning up, we can make popcorn for dessert. - Yeah. - Yeah.
