(exiting rock music) (yelling and shouting) (thudding) (gun cranking) (gunshots booming) (men yelling) (upbeat jazz music) - There's no one here! Look, I can see nothing! (woman speaking French) Nothing here. (birds chirping) - Well, I'm going, old man. - I knew it. Jacques! - A university in the United States actually accepted me. What do you think of that? - [Woman] Jacques! You bastard! Why are running away?! - Oh no! - [Woman] How could you do this?! (woman yelling in French) - I thought we settled this last night? Why drag it out? It's hard enough on me as it is. - And what am I supposed to do with this while you're gone? (moaning) (woman laughing) - Thank you. (faint speaking) Okay, thank you. (office commotion) Hello, Mr. Jacques Montaigne. - Ah, Mr. Montaigne. Yes, we were expecting you two days ago. (sighing) - Yes, I was detained. - Mmmmm. Well wait over there. The dean will see you as soon as possible. - Thank you. (students chattering) - Yes. Mr. Montaigne, the dean will see you now. (students groaning) - [Male Student] What is this? This sucks, I've been waiting all day. - When our football team was suspended for recruiting violations, the chairman of your department actually celebrated. And I think you should know he does not appreciate the pressure he's been receiving from the Olympic committee. - I can understand that. I don't like being pushed around either. - No, I don't supposed you do. Well, at any rate, he gives a party every year for the new graduate students on the first day of classes. Now that's today, in case you're unaware, and you are expected to attend. That party begins at 7:30 in the graduate library. If I were you, I would make every effort to be there. - Well, I'll be sure to make it. - Where are you staying? - I was hoping to live where the other students live. - I don't think you wanna do that. - Why not? I'm here to learn and I'll learn more from students who can help me with my English. (laughing) - You don't need to convince me of your seriousness, Mr. Montaigne. Nobody with your kind of background would even apply to this graduate program unless he were serious. But I suppose that's your business. Eleanor will direct you to student housing and if there's anything more I can do for you, please let me know. - Thank you. - [Eleanor] I doubt that you're going to find anything at this late date, Mr. Montaigne. - Excuse me. - [Eleanor] But you might give the student ghetto a try. You're so late, I just don't know. - Full up. - [Eleanor] However, the student ghettos within walking distance. You said you didn't have a car. Now here, here's a map of the area. You're here. The main residential area is here. - No, no. I'm sorry, pal, I rented the last one this morning. Know what I mean? - [Eleanor] You probably don't wanna venture out much past fourth street. We do have a couple of listings on the sheet for those streets but you're into pretty rough territory out there. (rhythmic steel drum music) (kids shouting) (ominous music) (banging) (metal banging) - Hey, kids, leave him alone! Okay, you're all right. - So what do you want, a fucking medal?! - Hey. Hey, kids, come on. Come on. Okay, do you know here this address is? - Hey, I can't read, man. (laughing) - Okay. Okay, hey, come on. Come here. Come on. Okay, you know where this address is? - Yeah, it's a great big old house. There's an old sign in front. You can't miss it! (upbeat music) (Spanish radio commotion) - Jesús. (yelling in Spanish) That sign don't mean nothing, aye! - Didn't you hear, man? Nobody home there. - Where you going, aye? (knocking) - [Woman] Yes? - Hi, I'm a new student at the university and they tell me you have rooms for rent. - But they made a big mistake, didn't they? - Hey, Maria. Looking like a million bucks. - I'll give you 20. - Hi. - Who are you? - My name is Jacques Montaigne and I'm looking for a room to rent. - [Old Woman] The university sends him, Maria - Come inside for a minute. - Thank you. (door creaking) (speaking Spanish) - I'm sorry, we haven't rented rooms for over a year. - Please make an exception. There are no other places left and I have to be back on campus for a meeting in half an hour. - It's not safe here. I told them to take us off the list. We can't afford the liability. - I'll pay your insurance. Please, this is very important to me. - You're not a drug dealer, are you? - Maria. - Oh, it's all right. No, I'm not, I've saved for many years to go to school here. Let me just stay for a couple days until I can find another place, okay? This is great, thank you. - You're welcome. The bathroom is down the hall on the left and there's some fresh towels in the cupboard by the sink. Here. This is to the front door. Please, don't lose it. - There won't be any trouble, I promise you. - Oh. Are you going to wear this to the reception tonight? - Yeah. - Well, why don't I have Mother Ordonez press it for you? - Thank you. (speaking Spanish) (upbeat rock music) (knocking) - Hey, Jesús. - [Jesús] What? - He's back, man. Check it out. Hey, bato! Where you going? Wait a minute. We wanna talk to you, man, come here! - [Jesús] Get over here. - Hey! What's the language you speak, bato? - You gonna be saying at the Ordonez house our what? - I think if you do, things are gonna go very hard for you, man! - Don't mess with me. (pleasant jazz music) Hello. - Glad to have you aboard. - Thank you, sir, glad to be here. - I need another drink. - There are only a couple left. - Who else is there? - Let's see, there's... Yeah, there's the Browning woman. - Hi, what have we got here? - You taught her father here in '59. And there's Mr. Montaigne. He's been waiting for about two or three hours now. - Let's let him wait some more, shall we? Now, which one is the Browning woman? - Chairman Rice, what an honor to finally meet you. - Makes me sound a little like a leader of a communist country, doesn't it? Dr. Rice is sufficient, Miss-- - Browning, Ann Jeanette Browning. - Remember her father. - Oh, yes. I remember your father telling me once how much he hoped he have a boy. How disappointed he must've been when you arrived. But then, I'm sure you're doing everything in your power to make up for it. (chuckling) Now then, where's our "jock?" Mr. Montaigne. - Dr. Rice. - Welcome to the engineering department. Now I'm sure you've been told but in case you haven't, you should know that I think you are an intellectual imposter. And I think that everyone else will know that before I'm through with you. I don't care what the Olympic committee wants. You're in for a rough year, sir, and you'd better be prepared for it. Neanderthals should stay in the arena where they belong! - Mr. Montaigne, Sara Reichert, second year Environmental Stress Analysis and other structural trivia. I hope you didn't take any of that seriously. - Is he always that friendly? (giggling) - That's nothing. When I was first introduced to him last year, he asked me how I was expected to lead and think at the same time. (Sara giggling) - Pleasant fellow. - Listen, I have this idea. I always have to find someone to escort me back to my apartments, so, well, if you'll do that for me, then I'll fill you in on all the department gossip I know. - All right. (Sara giggling) - What's this about the Olympic committee? Are you a gymnast or something? What? ♪ Well I finally tracked you down in London ♪ ♪ You said meet me in Paris town ♪ ♪ But when I got to your chateau ♪ ♪ Across the channel ♪ A frilly hanging dress was all I found ♪ ♪ I've been running ♪ Running blue ♪ My love for you ♪ Has got me living out the running blues ♪ (upbeat rock 'n roll music) - You can count on him testing you at his first seminar. Now that's tomorrow afternoon, you know. If you can take the heat that he gives you then, he'll leave you alone for the rest of the semester. I know because I couldn't so I have to take it again. I hope this isn't too far out of your way. I kinda thought you might have a car. - No, not at all. I live a few more blocks away. - So, how long you been with-- (thugs shouting) (beat music) - Fuck you, man! Fuck you! (engine revving) Let's take Goldilocks home! Fucking puta! Fuck her, home, fuck her! Fuck you, man, fuck you! (clattering) - Are you okay? - Hold it! Hold it! (thugs shouting) (thudding) - Behind you, man! Get him up, get him! Fuck you! Get him, get the fucker right there! (thudding) Hit him harder! Come on, homes! Come on, come on, come on! (thudding) (thugs shouting) (thudding) - It's okay, man, I don't wanna fight, man. - [Thug] Come on, Frenchy! - Come on, you ain't so tough, come here, man! (thudding) Come on, man! Bring him over here! Bring him over here, man! Come on, I want the guy! Bring him over here! I'm gonna fuck him up! I gonna kick his ass, man, I'm gonna kick his ass! Come on! What're you looking at?! Get up! Get up! (thudding) (groaning) Queer, come here, man! Come... Come on, man, come on! Come on, you and me, huh?! You and me! Stick him, Spider! Spider, man, come on! Check him, home! Stick him, stick him, home! (exciting rock music) - Don't fuck with me! - Don't worry about it, homes! Don't worry about it! Come on, come on, homes! Get out of here! Get out of here! (guys shouting) - It's okay, man, we'll take it from here. You oughta get those things registered. - I think I better go with them and see if I can do something. See you in class tomorrow? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks for the escort. - [Man] Let's go back in the house! - [Guy] Okay, come on, Mary, let's go! (students chattering) (faint talk radio commotion) - [Radio Host] Now wait a minute, Joe, wait a minute. I know you do but we got a lot of calls coming in. All the lines are lit up. We gotta give somebody else a chance, okay? (Chuy speaking Spanish) - [Jesús] You're in the wrong neighborhood, homes. Hey, get over here! - [Chuy] We've been looking all over for you. - [Jesús] We're gonna kick your ass. We're gonna fuck you up, aye. - Oh, shit. - Get him! (grunting) (thudding) (fighting commotion) (thudding) (thugs grunting and groaning) - [Thug] Come on, homes, get in there! (fighting commotion) - [Chuy] No, take it easy! Stop! Stop! Wait a minute! (fighting commotion) (dramatic music) (woman speaking French) - You are never going to get out of here. You will never do anything with your life. You will never amount to anything! You will end up in the gutter with all the scum that you know! (dramatic music) (muffled beat music) (thugs laughing) - Martin! You are late tonight, homes. You mamacita be very angry with you, homes. Do you like my new Uzi, here, ese? (speaking Spanish) I don't anybody gonna give this homeboy a problema. What do you think, huh, homes? I think too I'm getting really tired of you not wanting to join us! You know, that shit really pisses me off knowing you don't wanna be a member with us. Maybe you think you're too good for us, homes. Like your old man! Maybe we gotta teach you and your mom a lesson like I did your father, punk! (ominous music) Get him, homes! - [Thug] Let's go after him, come on! (thugs yelling) (banging) (screaming) (thudding) (thugs shouting) - [Maria] Martin! - He lives here? - You know him? - [Angel] What, you scared of him or something?! - [Maria] He's my son. - [Angel] Get back on that porch and pull him out! Get on him! Get on him, homes! (thugs shouting) (banging) - That's enough! (gagging) Get the fuck out of here! Leave them alone! Let them alone! (thugs shouting in Spanish) I'm very sorry. I thought he was breaking in and I heard you scream. I think I should leave. I've made a mistake, I shouldn't have stayed here. - That won't be necessary. I can see how it could happen. Martin is partly to blame. We can settle it in the morning, all right? - That's not how to deal with them. You can't kill them all, you know? Goodnight. - I didn't know who he was. Who is he anyway? - He's a graduate student at the university. I rented a room to him today. If you'd been home this afternoon, you would've known that, mijo! You were supposed to call me, where were you?! - I've been walking, ma. - You are supposed to call me when you're late! Put the gun away! I was up half the night worry about you, then you come flying through the window with a gun! What's the matter with you?! - [Martin] They were chasing me! - [Maria] You scare me to death with a gun in your hand?! (dramatic music) (Martin and Maria arguing) (French yelling echoing) - Fuck me, you want to fuck me?! Fuck me now! - Jacques! Jacques! (speaking French) You did what you had to do. Come away, you can't stay. (suspenseful music) (gunshot booming) Go! Go! (gunshot booming) (groaning) (dramatic music) - I'm sorry about last night. - No problem. - You don't have to leave on my account. She won't say so, but I know my mother will feel safer with someone in the house besides me. - Are you going to school? - Yeah. - [Maria] Are you sure it's safe? You don't have to go if you're afraid. - I'm not afraid, Mom, problem. I'll be all right. - I'm sorry I can't talk, I'm late for work. I left your money with Mother Ordonez. I'm sure that you can find some place more pleasant than this. (faint Spanish talk radio) - Now remember, you go through the backyard. (faint Spanish talk radio) Ah, good morning, Senor Montaigne! - Hey, buenos días, señora. - [Chuy] No more Frenchy, man. And where's Martin? - [Jesus] We wanna talk to him, man. This is it, no more, no more... - It's all right, we will walk together. (yelling Spanish) - We told you, Maria, no more. - [Maria] Buenos días, Frank! Cómo estás? - Muy bien, señora, muy bien. (speaking Spanish) - He's a veteran? - He's a nice man. (ominous music) He was a good friend of my husband and he tried to be helpful to Martin. - Oh God, I forgot something. Will you be all right, alone? - Of course, you've been very kind. It's just a few blocks from here. - I'll talk to you later. (foreboding music) - [Angel] Come on, open the fucking door, homes! (thugs shouting) - Martin, put the gun down! (thudding) (groaning) (thuds shouting) - Grandma, call the police! Call the police! (thugs shouting) (thudding) - Guys, over here! Get him! (thudding) - [Grandma] No, Martin! (thudding) - Get him! Yeah, get him! - Come on, homes, get over here! Come on, come over here, homes! - That's it, fuck him up, homes! (thudding) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Hey! (thudding) (groaning) (yelping) (moaning) - Come on, get in there, get in there, get in there! Get in there! (thudding) (swishing) (grunting) (suspenseful beat music) (yelping) Where is he?! Where is he?! (suspenseful music) (thudding) (groaning) (thugs shouting) Hey, Martin! Come on! Come on! (gagging) - Shit. - Where'd he go? Where'd he go? - I don't know, man! - [Jacques] No, get out of here! Get out of here! - But my grandma! - Where is she?! - In the kitchen! (dramatic music) - Let's get him! Oh shit! (gunshots booming) - Hey, come on, man! - Get over here, man, what the fuck happened here?! What happened?! Get over here! - Hey, where can take her?! - [Chuy] Angel! Angel! It's Frenchy! - Bring her here! - Stay there and wait for me on the porch! - He's not gonna do nothing, homes! - [Chuy] He's got the old lady! - [Angel] I don't care about the Frenchy and old lady! I want Martin! - Martin! - Set her down right there. What happened? - [Jacques] I don't know, she just fainted. - What's your problem, huh?! What's wrong with you?! - Angel! Angel! - Come on! Come on! Come on! (ominous music) There he goes! Get him! (suspenseful music) What the hell is your problem, homes?! Why didn't you grab him, man?! - Martin! - What the hell is wrong with you, man?! Move! Move! Move! Stop right here, man! Go get him, man, go get him! Move! Move! (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) There he goes, man! Back it up! Back it up! Move! Move! (suspenseful music) - [Jacques] Martin! (tires screeching) Martin! (suspenseful music) - Come on, homes, come on! There he goes! Come on, get in, get in! Come on! Move! Move! Come on! Go, move! (suspenseful music) - Where are we? So what?! So why are we stopping here? - We can't go in here. - Who says? (rap beat music) (tires screeching) - Hey, whoa, motherfuckers! (tires screeching) Come on, motherfuckers! What's up with you, man?! What you doing in my hood?! - Fuck you, man! Fuck you, motherfuckers! I'll fuck you up! I'm gonna fuck you up big time, homes! Get the fuck out of here! Crank it up! - Get out of here, man! Punk motherfucker! (engine rumbling) What's up with you, man?! (tires screeching) I'll take you out, punk! I'll take you out! - Fuck you too! (engine revving) - Hey, man, you want me to go after homeboy?! - No, no! Anybody that fucking brave gets a free pass from me anytime, homeboy. - Shit, I heard that man. - Let me see. Yep, now you're beautiful. How do you feel? - All right. - Your friend is over there. Are you sure you don't want me to call the police? - No cops. - No, it's okay, he's gonna be all right. - Okay. - Thank you. So what did you do? - Nothing. The guy with the Uzi wants me to join his gang. - And you don't want to? Why not? I thought every kid wanted to join a gang. - My mother and my grandma don't want me to. - And what about your father? - My father's dead. - So what you gonna do? - I don't know. Probably join 'em. They're gonna kill me if I don't. What is this, man, a social survey or something? Or are you collecting real life experiences for your classes? - I've got better things to do than waste my time with you, believe me. I don't take shit from anybody! - Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy there, will you? - Sorry, sir. Look, that's not the way to deal with it. Why don't you fight back? I know you know how. What's your problem? Come on. - It's not just me. They said they'll hurt my mother and my grandmother too. Don't you understand? - Man, they got you good. Look, we gonna find you a place to hide out for a few days until you can make sense again. All right? Come on. Thank you, sir. Come on, Henry, where the hell are you? Here we go. You know where this address is? How far? - About a mile. - Come on, let's go. What's wrong? Let's go. - Who are you? (ominous music) - I can't believe it! Why didn't you call us?! You look great! - God, you look so beautiful. - You know, Henry will be so happy to see you. Oh my, why don't you go in and see him? - Okay. - Go. - Let's go, Martin. (thudding) (yelling) - Jacques. You arrive at last. I was wondering if you had chickened out. So how's college life? - Cream but I can't talk right now. I have this kid with me, he needs a place to hang out for a day or two. Can you help him? - I suppose. Who is he? - I'll fill you in when I get back. Listen, I'm gonna be late for my first class. Can someone give me a ride back to the campus? - This is a great start, Montaigne. Just great. So why'd you give up fighting, Jacques? - Oh, you gotta give it up sometime, Henry, or you'll end up like Muhammad Ali, you know? (chuckling) Take a right here, will you? I've gotta pick up something where I'm staying first. Henry, pull up just right there. - [Henry] Here? - [Jacques] Where the ambulance is. God, what's going on here? - [Henry] You took a room in this house? (dramatic music) (crying) - Who is it? - It's Marin's grandmother, man. Heart attack. Happened just a little after you left. She comes running out of the house into the street, man, screaming hysterically, man, calling out for Martin. She just collapsed, man. You know they're gonna ask where Martin is. So I told 'em that I thought you lost him. - Right. - Yeah. (dramatic music) - Where's Martin? I heard that you were with him today. - I don't know, I couldn't keep up with him but I'm sure he's all right. I'm sorry, Maria. - Is this your boarder? Why don't you take her in? Can I talk to you for a minute? (dramatic music) They say you took the old lady out of the house before the gang broke in. Was she all right then? - Yeah, she fainted. They didn't touch her, if that's what you mean. Can I go inside? I left my briefcase. - We've got your briefcase. Found it in the back. Gensen, bring his briefcase. - Do you need me for anything else? - No. No, you're free to go. - Thank you, sir. - [Officer] Okay, clear the way here, folks. Would you step back, please? (dramatic music) - The kid, his name is Martin Ordonez, isn't it? - You know him? - I knew his father. We both went to South Central Neighborhoods Committee back in the late '70s. We had one of our first gang resistance meetings in that house. - He fought the gangs? - He tried to. They finally shot him down on his own front steps in 1984. He became a folk hero among the Hispanics in the city. - Did his son see him get killed? - The whole neighborhood saw him get killed. He was giving a speech on community solidarity. That was the end of any active resistance in this part of town. It just took the heart out of everybody. In my opinion, he'd be better off joining the gang. - And never even try to avenge his father's murder? - His father was a fool! We all were! It's just not like other places. They just kill the whole family if he doesn't. There's no reason to it anymore, Jacques. There's no code, no honor, no loyalties, no nothing! - Don't you remember what it was like, Henry? When we first met in Hong Kong, when you were fire! Before you became a fat cat business man. - Do what you have to do, Jacques. I'll hide him for awhile but you make sure you tell his mother where he is. He's a minor and I'm not a kidnapper. And I'm not telling him about his grandmother either, that's your problem. When do you want me to pick you up? - Oh, don't bother. - [Henry] What're you gonna do? - I will get there by myself. - [Henry] Okay, fine. - We'll start with that equation and see what you can do with it. - Well, Mr. Montaigne, so glad you could join us. - My apologies. I got lost. - Is that the guy? - [Professor] Whenever you're ready. - Hi. What's wrong? - Nothing. Do you know who our guest is? - No. - Predo Ordonez's son. Martin. Martin. Why don't you come down and watch the next class? We could get something to eat after that. - Where's Jacques? - I dropped him off at his first class. He'll be back in awhile. I knew your father, you know? - You did? - What is wrong with that equation? Anybody. - Perhaps our learned Frenchman can give us the answer. - Mr. Montaigne? Are you with us? - The power is wrong. - Yes. Where, exactly? - On the first cosine you have it on the third. It should be on the fifth. (student chuckling) - [Girl] I can't believe this. - Exactly. - Leave it to the fucking frog. - That's Mr. Frog to you. Rag head. (students mumbling) (giggling) - He's a big celebrity in Europe. What is it by now? Four? - Five. - Five world titles. The U.S. Olympic team has hired him to come here and train our demonstration teams for Spain. - Is that why he's going to the university? - No, no, no. Jacques is one of those guys who has to be studying something all the time. It's engineering this time, I think. - Mm-hmm. - If he's so smart, what's he doing living in a barrio with a bunch of dumbass Chicanos? - He was born in a ghetto in France and he was living in a ghetto in Hong Kong when we met him. He probably feels more at home. And I don't think that your father would appreciate you calling your neighbors "dumbass Chicanos." - Well they are. - Let's see, that makes your father a "dumbass Chicano," doesn't it? - No! - No? He lived in that neighborhood. You live in that neighborhood. That makes you a "dumbass Chicanos." I rest my case. All right, Henry, I need to work off a little steam. Choose me your best. - Why don't you fight me? (people laughing) - I fight fighters. Come on, let's go. - You're in a great mood. What's eating you? Your professor wrap your knuckles for being late? - You know what's wrong with professors, Henry? They've got no imagination. They are too tight in the head. They're so predictable. You don't teach your boys to be like that, do you? Well, let's find out. (thudding) (exciting music) (exciting music) (thudding) (clapping) Are you watching this, kid? It's fun and safe, isn't it? (groaning) (ominous music) The only reason he's not dead, Martin, is because I don't want him dead. When I want him dead, he dies! Do you understand what I'm talking about? Joining a gang never protect anyone. If a gang wants you, your family dead, then just do it! The only reason I don't kill Henry is because I'm afraid of him! I know if I kill him, I will be killed by his wife, his son, someone will do the job. (ominous music) I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. (somber music) - Take care. - I'd like to stay if that's all right with you. - I want to thank you for trying to help Marin today. The neighbors told me what you did. - Mrs. Ordonez. - Maria. - Maria, just let me know if you need anything, okay? - They brought some food. Please, can you tell me where Martin is? (distant beat music) (tires screeching) (thug commotion) - Órale, Martin! Hey, Martin! Come on out! We wanna talk with you, ese! - We know you're in there, Martin! There's no use in hiding. - We're gonna find you sometime! (thugs shouting) - We don't have any negotiations with you, lady. We just want to speak to your mijo. (thugs laughing) - You are so brave. I am so impressed with the bravery of men who frighten an old woman to death. I don't know where my son is. Maybe your "brave" men shot him in the back like they did my husband. Maybe now you would like to shoot an unarmed woman to death too! - Maybe if you're very nice to us. Maybe we don't kill you. (laughing) (sinister music) Oh, fuck, ow! Shit! - Just go back inside. Now! - [Angel] Shit! - The cops on their way. (thugs shouting) (glass shattering) (huffing) - They never come, the police. - [Jacques] I know. - They'll be back. They won't come in. My husband killed one of them once when they tried. They're afraid to come in the dark. She was basically a political refugee. Came to this country in the '30s. She was happy here. Till the last 10 years when the gangs got so crazy. - And what about your parents? - They're dead. They just died from working. First Papa and then a few years later, Momma died too. Everything. Everything was for this house. So that they could leave something for me. And now this house is like a coffin for us. A coffin in a graveyard. - Why didn't you leave? - At first it was because of my husband. He didn't want to give in to them. And then, when he was killed, his mother couldn't bear to leave his memory. Later, when I tried to sell the house, there were no buyers. Nobody wants to live here anymore. - And now, if I can find a buyer for you, would you leave then? (gunshots popping) (screaming) (glass shattering) Get down! Stay down! (gunshots popping) (glass shattering) Get back! (gunshots popping) (water fizzling) (glass shattering) (car engine revving) (tires screeching) (ominous music) - That's okay, we'll take it from here, sir. You go on ahead. - Thank you. - Yes sir, goodnight. (dramatic music) - Martin, they're here. - Thanks, Henry, I know this is asking a lot of you. - Jacques, as long as I've know you, you've been in deep shit. I expect this. - Martin! - What do you know about this gang? - I don't. But I do have a friend who will know something about it. - No, it can't be true! I'm gonna kill 'em! - No, Martin! - I'm gonna kill 'em! - Martin, please! For me, for your grandmother. Please don't do anything. - Not yet. - I need to talk to your friend now. - Henry. - I'll be back in awhile. (foreboding music) Is he on his way? - Henry, relax, Mr. Park will be here any minute. Okay, Henry. - This had better be good, Henry. - Who is the homeboy with the white Chevy flashing the Uzi these days? - Which one? - Cruises the four street barrio area. - Was there a woman driver? - That's the one. (speaking foreign language) - [Henry] Is that all he is? - You mean, is he working for anybody? No. He's just a wild dog collecting fleas. - How many fleas? - 20, 25. - Can he be... intimidated? - In my opinion, he's nothing without the Uzi. But then again, I don't know anybody who's challenged him. (ominous music) (knife clicking) (gasping) - Don't say a word! Now you listen to me, creep. You lay off the Ordonez family or you're going to be riding with Pancho Villa. You got that? - Yeah. - You got that?! (Angel groaning) Good. So now, don't let me disturb you. (gasping) (laughing) (smacking) (tries screeching) (crickets chirping) - Open the fucking door, man! Who the hell is the Frenchy, huh?! - I don't know, I told you, he rents a room in the house next door, that's all I know, man. Let go of me, for Christ sakes, I didn't do nothing. - And then how the fuck does he know where I live?! - I don't know! I don't know, I swear, man! - Angel, he's got friends in Chinatown. You know the gook that runs the gum on Main? He came by earlier. Too Martin and Maria away. Right after you split. - [Chuy] Nah, she's with the Frenchman. - You mean they know about us, homes? (speaking foreign language) That's cool. Now everybody's gonna know who we are. - So what did the Frenchman want? - What? - You said the Frenchman knows where you live. I figured he came by for something. - Yeah, she sends him over here to beg for mercy. She wants to make a deal, so I tell him I think it's too bad about their house. I think they need some protection, man. I tell them to pay me once a month, one, two hundred dollars, I guarantee that nothing happens to her mijo anymore, man. - And she went for it? - Yeah, I think she can handle it, man. But we gotta wait till the old lady's funeral so we can collect the first payment. Hey, man, your old lady, she make a lot of noise when you fuck her, homes. - [Chuy] Yeah. - That's good. Because I need to fuck me a girl real bad. But I don't want any singing. Do you mind if I borrow your old lady, homes? (ominous music) So now I don't think we bother the Ordonez or the Frenchy anymore. You got that? Now we start to hit up the rest of the neighborhood for protection money. Tomorrow you start on the ones that take in the old ladies after they get the heart attacks, homes. (helicopter buzzing) Get over here! - [Radio Announcer] Good morning, Los Angeles. This is Air Watch Two with the 6AM report. All freeways in the downtown area are clear at this hour. Now to Barbara-- - And Henry and I will go with you to and from your work for a few days. At least until after the funeral. And then we see how things are. - What about Martin? What's going to happen to him? - Well, if you can convince him, he should probably stay with us for awhile. Unless you have some there relatives. (foreboding music) - I'll be right back. (ominous music) (glass crunching) - I'll get a few things. Be ready in a minute. (sinister music) - God, in your own room? Did she see? I can't believe this. - Henry, someone has to kill this man. - Yeah. - I put some of Martin's things in there. - Henry's going to have someone come in and board up the broken windows for you today. - Thank you. - Goodbye. I'll meet you right here at six. - If I'm late, you can come into my office. It's in the Career Planning Center. - Okay. Bye. - There he is! There's Frenchy right there! - That's him, that's the guy! - Yeah, that's the guy, homes, relax! Hey, I thought you said you did this before! (tires screeching) Christ, man, just do it, let's not take all day! - [Boy] Gotta get him closer, man. Jesus, I lost him. - [Jesus] All right, puta, how's this? (gunshots booming) (groaning) (ominous music) (tires screeching) (clattering) - I got him, I got him! Jesus, I got him! (suspenseful music) - Don't move! Don't move! Hold on! Come here! Come here! And call the police! Call the police! Come here! Shit, keep the gun on him. Don't let go! - Let me go! Let me go! (clattering) (suspenseful music) - I give up, man! I give, ugh. (groaning) I give up, man! (groaning) - Call security! Tell them that guy was involved in the drive-by shooting! - I don't give a damn, man! I just wanna know if you got him! Okay, that's good. That's real good. You lie to me, man, and you're the one dead! Okay, okay, man, that's good. That's okay, man. Okay, I need you to do something else for me, all right, homes? I need you to call the cops, all right, man? - Just for a couple of hours. - Yes, of course. I'll just be a few minutes. I need a few hours off. - All right, Mrs. Ordonez, but this is two days now and we'll expect you to make up the hours. - I will, I'll come back as soon as I can and I'll stay late tonight until I'm caught up. - Very well. - Thank you. - Tell Chang to take over my classes today. I have to go back to the Ordonez's house for awhile. - I wanna go with you. - I don't think that's a very good idea yet, Martin. - Henry! Do I call you that or so I have to call you "Master" or something? - Just Henry. - Well listen, Henry, you've been very nice to me, letting me stay here and all. But I have to go home now. - It's not a burden, Martin. You and your mother can stay with us as long as you need to. - Look, I have to! - Okay. (men chattering) I guess you better get you trash cans in here. You don't mind us giving you a helping hand here, do you? I promised your mother that I-- - No! No, that's okay. Thanks. (ominous music) (exciting bongo drum music) (yelling Spanish) - What's up, man? (door creaking) (gun cranking) (ominous music) - Oh my God! Shit, fuck, goddamn! No! (gunshot booming) - Angel, what the hell's the matter with you, man?! Oh shit! - I'm gonna kill 'em! I'm gonna kill all of 'em! Then we're gonna burn down this whole fucking neighborhood! Shut up! (shouting in Spanish) Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! (sinister music) - So what do you think? - Where'd you get it? - I bought it from a dealer. - Come here. What'd you do with the girl? - I took her home. - Jesus, what's the matter with you? What the hell are you doing? You're not helping these people, you're making it worse. - What are we supposed to do? Just sit by and watch while punks like them just take over? - It's not your fight. It's his. They're killing each other. If he wants to join the gang, that's is business. - Is that your advice? Did you tell him that? I know how they got to him, Henry. How did they get to you? How much protection do you pay your lug-head goons? What was his name? Mr. Park? - I've got a wife and children, Jacques! It's not just me anymore and it's not just him. What're they gonna do when you leave, huh? Because you're gonna leave, Jacques. You always leave. - Yeah right. Tell him his mother is expecting someone to take her home tonight, okay? (engine buzzing) (upbeat Latin music) - There goes that son-of-a-bitch we got in a fight with the other day! (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) Watch where he goes. (ominous tempo music) - I owe you one, Tony. - Yeah you do. If you don't pay up, I'll come get you the same way. (speaking Spanish) (tires screeching) - This program, if you do it right, it'll work for you. Now just watch, this one and that. There you go, excuse me. So, what do you think? Will this baby do what you need? Because if it doesn't, I've got some other programs I could show you. - No, this will do. Thanks for the demonstration. - Oh, right. And now you know what we've got and we're open 24 hours a day now. Take one of those flyers by the door. - Thank you. - I'll give you the rules and stuff. Oh yes, you're welcome. (ominous tempo music) (explosion booming) - That's it, let's go! (engine revving) (exciting rock music) (tires squealing) (crickets chirping) - Okay, that's the last of it. (exiting rock music) (tires screeching) (engine rumbling) - What's going on here? - I don't know. (gunshots popping) (booming) (exciting rock music) - [Thug] Hey, come on, man! Hey, man! Yo, he's dead! - [Jacques] Call security! - Think I should help this guy out? (thudding) - [Jacques] Thanks! - He's fucked up. (laughing) - I know. (whimpering) (thudding) (groaning) (thudding) (yelling) (gasping) (grunting) (yelping) - Tell me what's happening! - It wasn't anything personal, man! You understand that, don't you? - Than what was it?! - Angel wanted you and the gook out of the way. - Why?! - Because he's gonna do the Ordonez kid and the mother tonight. - Oh my God, can I trust you to stay here until the police come?! - Yeah! - Can I?! - Yeah! - Sure I can! Die! (crunching) (ominous music) - Martin, wait up. Do you drive? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You go pick up your mother. I'll get a ride back with the boys. I'll come by and pick it up tomorrow, all right? - Hey, somebody's coming, we gotta get out of here. - [Angel] Shoot the motherfucker, man! (ominous music) - Hey, buddy, is that your car over there? (booming) (suspenseful music) (yelling Spanish) - Let's go! Come on! Come on! (tires screeching) (Angel yelling Spanish) (explosion booming) (alarm ringing) (Angel yelling Spanish) - Where's Sue Kim? - Henry! - Where are the kids? - They're upstairs. They're okay, they're bringing them down. - Okay, get out of here! (police radio commotion) (distant police sirens) - Officer, my mother works here, I was supposed to pick her up! - Officers responded when campus security-- - My mother works here, I was supposed to pick her up! I have to go inside. - What's your name, boy? - Martin, Martin Ordonez. My mother's Maria Ordonez, she works here. - Okay, I think you better wait here for a minute. - [Officer] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What is it?! What's happened?! - [Officer] Just take it Easy. Take it easy. - Martin? - [Martin] What do you mean, take it easy?! - It's all right, ma'am. Try not to move, you're gonna be okay. - That's my son. - [Martin] Why can't I go in there?! - I want to talk to my son. - She's very weak but she's gonna be all right. She can't talk for long. - Oh God, Momma. (dramatic music) - You have to go home, Martin. - No, Mom, I'm gonna stay with you. I'm not going anywhere. - She's just fainted. She's been in and out since we got here. - You have to go home. He said they're going to burn down the house. Go home. Get help. Go home. - [Medic] All right, that's enough. Her blood pressure's dropping, let's get her out of here. - She's in shock. I wouldn't take anything she said too seriously. (dramatic music) - I'll be going with the ambulance back to the hospital. Is there some place we can reach your father? - [Officer] My father's dead. - Oh, I see. Is there someone else, aunt or uncle? - Just me. Are you going with her? - Yeah, until a responsible party arrives. - Okay, you tell her, when she wakes up again, you tell her that I'm doing what she said. I'm going home. You'll do that? - [Officer] But you're coming back to the hospital, right? - Right, when I've done what she asked me to. - Hey, hey, wait a minute! - Find out at this time. Police believe... (faint beat music) - Hey, Jesus! Gook's back, man. - [Jesus] What's he doing? - I don't know, I don't know, man. - [Jesus] Is he getting out? - Nah, he changed his mind. He's driving down the road.
