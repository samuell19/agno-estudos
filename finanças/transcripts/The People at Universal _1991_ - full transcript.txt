THE PEOPLE OF LA UNIVERSAL You've reached "The Universal" P.I. Agency. No secret can resist us. Please leave a message and we'll get back to you. Nice voice honey. Hey your aunt's a drag. She must think I'm not going to pay her. Fortunately I didn't answer because... ...I'd have told her to go to hell. Sometimes I think my aunt is right. About what? That's Clemente. He'll have to wait. Are you done yet? Almost there. Now! Now! No, uncle, I had a rough time with that dog. What's its breed? What a drag. But it's work. Work? It took a dump on my bed and almost ate my partridge. What's with the haircut? Just right for the earring. Now they'll think you're a pussy. No pussy uncle. This is for men. For men? Fabiola. Come here. Let me show you Pepito's surprise. Look at that haircut. Perfect for the earring. Come on, uncle. No, he looks great. He's still young. Where did you get money for the haircut? What do you mean where? Working. Sure, the dog paid for it. Don't answer! It's Fabiola's aunt, she has been calling to annoy me. She's getting up early to collect? - You know her. - We owe her, don't we? We're gonna pay her. - When? - When? When they pay for that dog. - Somebody answer. - Hey uncle. - Or I'll find another agency. - Sounds foreigner. This is Sergeant Hernandez, owner of "La Universal". Yes, that's right. Yes? We work around the clock, anywhere in the city. Yes, my pleasure. Could it be later? No. Yes, my pleasure. Yes I know where it is. I'll be there at 10 o'clock. I'll be there at 10 a.m. My pleasure. What's up uncle? We've got work? An imprisoned foreigner. They've got lots of money. And we'll get more if he's imprisoned. This is what you owe me, Sergeant! It's been four months. Pay me with your motorcycle. I can't give you anymore credit. I can't give you anymore credit, sergeant! Sergeant! Sergeant! Son of a bitch. He almost didn't leave us alone. Not here Pepito. Not here. We're exposed in a shop window. Then let's go to bed. No, not to bed. - What about stains? - To bed... Who'll stand Diógenes? What's up partner. Easy. Of course Sergeant. Hey man, please help the sergeant. Hey! Gaston Arzuaga. Gaston or Gastón? Gastón Arzuaga. The Spaniard. Sergeant. And where did you serve? To the Infantry, in Putumayo. Putumayo? Me too! Hey man. This is for the cigarettes. Okay. Maybe we even know the same people. Do you remember Chato? Of course. Remember Parrot's leg? Funny, isn't he? Thank you. Hey pal. - Are you from "La Universal"? - Yes. You swine, you're late. We were gonna hire somebody else. The lady arrived a long time ago. You're not our only client. We cancelled two appointments to be here. If you don't like it, scram! There are other agencies, we don't have to wait, or what? Key. Don Gastón. The detective you asked for. In the brown suit? Give me a cigarrette. I don't smoke. Hey, sergeant. The man will have to wait. He's talking to the moneyman. Don't worry it's the last time I'll need you. What do you mean last time? Did you get a parole? Give me the tool. Take a look at his woman. You'll have to watch her. Let's kill the fucker! I can't sign this, François. Do you think I'm stupid? I do you a favor and you treat me like this? Well, I'll see you Saturday. François! François! Wait a minute. Margarita, would you shut up? I just came to see you. Don't get mad. We're talking business. Wait for me in the cell, I'll be right there. Sit down. I do you a favor. I get you the money. Each week I have to come to this prison. Anything else I do, I make three times more money. I won't do any more business with you. Besides I lost money with that movie. I know about that. You don't have to remind me, François. No, there's no need to but... ...every time you fall in love with the leading actress... ...I have to lose money? I won't let anybody into my private life, François. That's my business. Well, that is your right. See you on Saturday. I'll buy you lunch. See you later. Bye. Fucking asshole. Rocha! May God protect you sir. Thanks. I hope God keeps you here for a long time. Your fucking mama is gonna stay here. This is... Do your thing! Everything you wish. I know that. - A promise is a debt. - Devil! There. - Thanks. - Fat boy. - You'll have the pack tonight. - Tonight! You collect but never keep your promises. Easy, Mr. Gastón. You can count on me. Why did you take so long? I had to do some things. Nobody must disturb us. Okay. She can handle it, right? All of it. ...it's not lion, it's plane. No, look. I have a plane called Pepito. No! Not Pepito! My boy deaf! What happened to you? - What happened? - My ear. The hole? Does it hurt? Yes. I'll put some medicine on it, poor baby. Want mommy to cure it? Yes. - I'll sing it to you. - Okay. I have a plane called Pepito. Little Pepito. I have a plane called Pepito. Sometimes it doesn't... Who is it? Who is it? The Rosales Brothers. Who is it? The Rosales Brothers. One moment please. How are you doing Mr. Gregorio? I've got a surprise for you. Mr. Clemente. Just as I promised. We recovered him in 72 hours. The dog's a little thin. You should've seen when we found him. He looked like hell. Covered in sludged... ...really sad... ...so we cleaned and combed him, and look at him now. Mrs. Fabiola. How you doing? I'm glad. How did you find him? Work secrets. - Good. - What? Pay! Here's 40,000. Mr. Clemente. I wanted to talk to you about that. The thing is the operation cost 20,000 pesos more. We had to pay the guy who had him, so... But we settled for 40,000... Yes but... Well... I didn't call you because I said to myself, I don't think... ...the Rosales will have a problem if I charge... ...20.000 lousy pesos more, after having such an animal! A magnificent animal! It's worth 60,000! Yes. Beautiful. Lend me ten. Okay but you owe me 30. We'll settle it later. Here's 59. We're not going to fight over 1,000 pesos. Okay, let's have it. Please give me an invoice. A what? An invoice. You don't want an invoice. You'll have to pay taxes... It's more expensive, 14%... Yeah, that's not for you. Why should we pay the government some tax money? We should spend it on the dog. Don't you love me anymore? It's been a while since you've been able to fuck me. It's this fucking jail. I can't fuck! Yes, It's claustrophobic. I can't even close my house curtains. I can't fuck. I can't fuck. I've to get out of here! I've to get out of here! I need to get out of here! Easy. Rocha! Come over here! The Spaniard's wife is here. Where? She's with Gonzalez. Hold her while I tip the man. Okay, count on me. Tell me you love me, Margarita. I love you. Who have you been with, Margarita? No one. Who have you been with? I'll kill him, Margarita! No, don't say that. Don't behave like this. Tell me whose pussy is this, Margarita? Tell me, whose is it? - Yours. - Tell me. You know it's yours. I'm all yours. Boss. Your wife's here. Shit! What's she doing here? Wasn't she coming later? Yes, in the afternoon. I don't know. Margarita, get dressed! Why should I hide and not the other way around? Who is your woman? You Margarita, but get dressed now. I don't want to. Then don't get dressed, fuck. Just don't go, Margarita. Wait for me, I won't be long. Margarita. I need to get out of here and she's my ticket out. Ticket out? She wants to take you to Spain and leave me here. You're coming to Spain with me. Didn't I give you the ticket? Yes, but you're pleasing her and you haven't given me... ...roses or anything lately. I give you anything you want, Margarita. Yes, but I saw some very nice clothes. Here. And a pair of shoes "to die for". Buy them. Without the stamp you can't get in. That's what I'm saying. Mr. Boix from the embassy. Manuel Boix, please to meet you, Mr. Arzuaga. Hello. Well it's settled. These are mere formalities. Pick it up. Double up. No, You didn't make it! They're from Salamanca, Mr. Arzuaga. The sausages, they're from Salamanca. Look. I brought some oil. It's Carbonell. And some hair lotion... ...'cause your... ...hair is a mess. You can't keep it up. Okay. Let's stop this non sense. Come on! Let's get on to business. Let's wrap it up. Mr. Manuel Boix works at the embassy. He'll validate your signature, so... ...you can sign these. This is a routine procedure, we've done it before... ...and there hasn't been any trouble. I hope we can get you out of this native hell. Well if the bank doesn't make up anymore stories... ...I hope next time you come to take me out... ...and not to bring anymore sausages from Salamanca. Sure. We've got tickets for Tuesday. What's that noise? Aren't those your balls? I don't know. They must be playing with them. They get bored. Hey Gastón, your balls are still making noise. Who's playing with them in your cell. I don't know, It's not important. They get bored. With this authorization Mrs. Begona can go to the bank... ...get the money to pay bail and you're out of here. That sound is making me nuts. Tell them to stop! What are they doing? I don't know. I won't stay here. The bail has been completely arranged. So much stories, so much paper work. Escobar's escape was a lot easier. What do you care? Leave them alone. Ok Mr. Gastón, but before you leave for Spain... ...let's meet at my hotel... ...so we can talk about my check. Sign here. Mrs. Begona. Here. Not here, here, where? Here. Thank you. Hey Gastón. Gastón! Who's that staring at me? What a nerve! You know her? Gastón! Who's this girl? How the hell should I know? Would you concentrate on this please? Sign here. If this is how you work, you're useless to me. I couldn't get here earlier. So why the hell do you compromise? You screw it up, and then... ...everything's ok. Calm down Mr. Calm down. It wasn't my fault. It was something important. I need you to watch my woman around the clock. Which one? I said my woman, not my wife. Don't be mistaken. My wife is a respectable woman. I want you to find out who's the... ...son of a bitch that is fucking her. Here's her address. Tap her phone. Tap... Tap her phone. Tap it. On your next visit I want detailed information. - This Saturday or the next one? - On Saturday. How much will it cost? Only for 4 days. Thirteenth floor... ...around the clock... ...2 agents at least. I'll charge you 200,000 for four days. And for tapping her phone I'll charge 50,000... ...that's what my man charges me. Here's 50,000 for the phone tap. When I have more information we'll talk about money. I need 80,000 to begin with, Mister. Here's 20,000 more... ...and if you don't want it, give me my 50,000... ...I've got many cards. - Ok, It's a deal. I'll manage with 70,000. Would you please sign here? What's this? I guarantee my work, Mr. Fucking signatures. Go to work. Devil. Come here. Hey Fabiola, what have you two being doing all day? Look at this mess. This desk is full of dust and old papers... ...and your wearing curlers here, in the office. Can't you see I've been cleaning after the dog. I haven't had any time. They just took it away. So you received the Rosales in the middle of this mess? They must think we are assholes. Yes uncle... but they paid. Look. The dog left us 40,000 pesos. They didn't leave a tip? Yes, the fleas. How was prison? It was fine. A Spaniard, we have to follow someone. Seems his woman is fucking someone else. How much did you settle for? 100.000 pesos for following her... ...and 20.000 pesos for the phone tap. Just that? No uncle. And I had to talk him into it. "The Hercules" and three more agencies were behind it. But I charged less for the phone tap and fucked them. Did you get something in advance? No, 20.000 lousy pesos. Just that? Just that? For the phone tap. We're not going to tap phones now, are we? Only if we were morons. When we could split it? Fabiola. Take the dog's money to your aunt and calm her. And we'll split the 20.000 among us, Clemente. I want to pay you 10.000 from last month. You mean two months ago, uncle. That's right I owe you. Easy kid, as soon as I get some money I'll pay you. Don't worry uncle, at worst I'll come here... ...to sleep with you two. So what's up, uncle? There are 29 floors. Pair numbers on this side. This one's difficult, isn't it? Wait and see. We'll have to do it from that terrace. It's a vulture's job. Not for vultures, for men. Too much for you? No way. We have to fool him. Who, the security guard? Who else? Let's get to it. That's what I'm telling you boss. I'm sorry... ...but you can't go in. Because then, why are they paying me to watch that door. You understand? Pal. It's a very simple job. A 24-hour follow up. I'm the law. I work for our country. I'll cooperate, boss. Everything for Colombia. Am I right? That's it pal. Go up sometime... ...she's a very pretty girl... ...maybe she'll show you something! - 18, 17, 16. - Shit. I missed it again. Start from there. Two, three, four, five, six... Next to the lamp. Next to... I was saying that, behind the lamp. There's nobody there. I know there's nobody there. That's what we are here for. Get your watch, we'll get synchronized. 18:14, 18:15... Let's see if that works until tomorrow... I'll come at 6:00 o'clock and take the shift. And stay sharp! I won't stay here until 6:00 in the morning... ...all night, freezing my ass! No, poor baby. We need men around here. Stay sharp. ...and pay attention. - Look! A woman came out. Is that her? Show me. Yes, it's her. That's her. Her hair is standing on end? Yeah, it's her. You can't see anything with this. Let me see. You have your own. It's a special manual that teaches you how to succeed. Love me and don't kill me... ... this book will teach a Christian mother... ... to teach her children... Careful! So obvious. You know what? I'll stay here. You might screw up this deal, so go home. What deal? You want to stay and watch the girl. What girl? It's work. I demand your respect. Go! Return at 6:00 for the morning shift. And Diógenes? I left him there, working he says. He was glued to the binoculars... ...looking at the girl we're watching. You liked her too? No, what's wrong with you, you're everything to me. What's with the hair? You like it? A lot! What did you spray on? You smell really nice. My aunt gave me this perfume. Yes? Come here. What will we give each other with the Rosales's 20,000. And with death stalking, there was an empty skull... I felt goosebumps... When I looked at the skull... His holes were looking directly at me... Pal. Pal. I'm leaving now. The boy will be here in no time. If he arrives at 6:00 o'clock tell him I left a bit earlier. And if he arrives after 6:00, tell him I left on time. That's not my problem. He's my nephew and I don't want to set a bad example. You're very kind, boss. I understand about the bad example. I'm also a father. Turn it off. Fabiola, my uncle. Hurry! Get dressed! Those aren't the ones, dummy! Are those it? Get dressed! The socks! The shoes! The socks, dummy! Hurry up! What do we do? Almost done. Move it! I told you, you see! You told me? You wanted it as bad as me. Hurry, Clemente hurry. We're fucked! Oh my God, the sheets. Fuck! Diógenes? Diógenes... Why did you turn on the light? To greet you, to take a look at you. No, I'm not talking about right now. When I was arriving I saw the light go on and off. Why? The motorcycle's sound woke me up, so I turned it on... ...to see what was the time, but when I saw it was... ...4:00 o'clock, I decided to go back to sleep... ...I didn't expect you until 6:00, at the end of your shift. Yes? How did you know my shift ended at 6:00 in the morning? And where would you be at this hour? Were you somewhere else? Were you drinking again? Drinking no... ...working. Freezing my ass in that building's terrace. And considering the lights went off at eleven... ...I told myself it would be stupid to continue... ...freezing myself, so I came here. But if Clemente asks tell him I arrived a bit after 6:00. I don't want him to think the cold scared me off. Is she pretty? Who? The girl you're watching. Why are you smiling, and why are you so happy. What smile... happy? The happy one was Clemente. He was glued to his binoculars, he was so distracted... ...I had to sent him home. Are you jealous? Come here, are you jealous honey? Come here. The one I love you is you. The one I love is you. Clemente! Clemente! That's what pisses me off. Having to stand them all over each other in jail... ...what about me? I told you... ...you can't trust a murderer. If you want... ...come with me to Paris and I'll introduce you... ...to five producers at least. So, that's what you tell all of us. I know Gastón really loves me. Loves you? As soon as he's out of jail he'll leave the country... ...he's gone with his wife, leaving you here all alone. He also gave me a ticket. He gave you a ticket? What's a ticket compared to what you're gonna do for him... ...in exchange for testifying for him. Of course. He knows I love him very much. You love him? Then what are you doing in bed with me? Now, that's different. Different, why? Flesh demands it! Don't you like it? Very much. Can I touch your ass? Okay, but be gentle. Take it easy Gastón. We haven't been able to get out of the hotel. My mother has diarrhea and I have a headache. Maybe it's the weather or something. Move it. Go to the bank to see if there is a new story. You don't know them... ... they'll say everything. It's Thursday, and we're missing things... ... don't you want me out on Saturday? Of course, we really want to. Look... ...when we have the money we'll let you know. What's that music? Rocha? I'm leaving you now. My mother is very sick you know. Bye. Fuck! The flesh and the spirit are always fighting... ... flesh pulls down and the spirit pulls up. Put Sergeant Hernandez on. Right at this moment he's in a meeting. Is this urgent? Diógenes. Sweetie. Wake up. It's urgent. It's the Spaniard. Wake up. Hello. Of course, since yesterday. We have a lot of leads but no evidence. Take it easy. Right now she's under surveillance. Let's wait until Saturday please. Let's wait to meet in person. These are things I can't tell you this on the phone. Sweetheart. We need information or we'll loose the deal... No, we need the money. Make some breakfast while I shower, I'll go see... ...what news Clemente has for me. Yes sweetie. Clemente! Clemente! Who is it? Phone! Coming. Hello. Who is it? Hi love. What's up my love? Fuck! ...And you'll get to see that woman you like so much. No, we'll speak about it later, you've got to run. Hi boss. Has my uncle arrived? No. I haven't seen him. But, many people come in here. If he asks you, please tell him I arrived at 6 sharp. Ok? As you wish. Did anything happen in the girl's apartment? I don't know. I'm being paid only to watch this place. Yes. What's up boss? What's up Sergeant? How's the boy? Very good. That boy's really something. You've given him a good example. He arrived at six sharp. You didn't tell him I left earlier, did you? Not a word. I'm a man of my word. Thanks man. My pleasure. What are you doing down there? I told you to stay here. This is really boring. Do you have any new information? Nothing has happened. Nobody has gone in or outside the apartment. Hey uncle, why... ...why didn't you wait for me? How about it? I left the building at six and you haven't arrived. No, yes. Since when do I have to answer to you? Ease up. Show me some respect. You're the one who has some explaining to do. We need something, the Spaniard called. - Do you know how to handle it? - Of course. Well open it here and keep it in 100. Leave it in automatic and press here. Let's see a smile. - Here. - Let me take one. Don't start fucking around, it's for the job. Move it man. Snap out of it. Stay sharp or you won't get anywhere. I have to do something but I'll be back soon, stay sharp! 72nd Street, nine-twenty. We've to go this way. Nine-twenty has to be that way. That's what I'm saying, lady. Without the bank stamp, I can't give you clearance. I have an authorization to deal some money... ...and we're in an emergency situation... ...we've been to window two and now here to obtain... ...clearance or something like that. We don't know what that is... ...don't know. That's what I'm saying, lady. I can't help you. I'm really sorry. We've been to the audit... ...and they said that they only put on stamp on Mondays. It's incredible. We want to know what we could do to speed up the process. That's what I'm saying lady... ...without the audit's stamp, I can't help you. Can you please give me a list of the things I have to do... ...instead of having to run around the building? I'm aging here! You're messing with us. That's what I'm saying, lady. That's what I'm saying, lady. That's what I'm saying, lady. With this, you won't have any more trouble. Thank you. You're welcome. My pleasure. Thanks, good bye. Finally. What is this? This can't be. Six months bonds? This can't be. What a country, after 500 years... ...they still haven't got banks! Please! What are we gonna do? What's up? Hello, Margarita. Has François arrived? Yes, for a while now. He's around. Okay. TALK DIRTY TO ME DR. X. - Good morning. - What's up Pipe? - How are you? - Okay. Ticket. TODAY: TALK DIRTY TO ME DR. CONTINOULY SINCE 11:00 A.M. Ticket. Hello. I bought some clothes. That Maria... ...damages everything when she cleans. Can you imagine? You know what? The money Gastón gave me wasn't enough. And I want some shoes. Would you buy them for me? Gastón never has any money. I'm always lending him. GENTLEMEN. LADIES. NICE TITS. ANA'S HOT. What's up man? - What's up? - What about, man? Ladies, man... ...gentleman. There's a lot of people over there or what? If you want to pee, over there... ...or get out! What's up? You're on second gear. Such a ladies man. And at the end nothing. Look at those eyes! Cat! Step on me, step on me. Are you alone? Scram! AII the kids know it's fun! What they have forbidden... ... the older ones say... ... don't be bad, be obedient. ... like everyone, you know forbidden is more fun. I paid my ticket. Sit down! The crowd is getting hot! Yes? Fernando... ...he was so beautiful! Do you want it here? Or is it too cold? Do you want to listen to your heartbeat? Yes, doctor. Poor guy. What a terrible way to die. Yes. I had never thought about death before... ...but now, I wake up at night, sweating... ...scared. We're all scared of death... ...let's not talk about it. Yes. The dead are dead... ...and we must go on and live with the living. Right. Look. Let me see. Let me see what you bought. A beautiful dress. Nice. I want the matching shoes. But they are so expensive. How much are they? $80,000 Okay... ...I'll buy them for you. You're so cute. Okay. She's definitely a bitch. Knowing that won't help if we can't catch her with someone. Look. Look. Where did you get that? I bet you took it from the cinema. She's an actress, fucks 20 times in this movie. These people are such perverts. Uncle, take a look at what they gave me. Fernando "tough" Lopez... ...and Gastón Arzuaga, he's the one that hired us. Take a look at this. Look. Seems Arzuaga is imprisoned for "tough" Lopez death. How did you get that uncle? Wisdom comes with baldness, son. You're right. So who is this François Bassil? I don't know. Hey uncle, you know what? I'll stay tonight and check on the girl. No, I'll stay. Give me the poster then, for my room. I'll return it in the morning. Give me the camera. ...But everything turned out fine, baby No, I'm nervous Pepito. Maybe Diógenes returns early again. But my uncle is crazy about that girl's poster. No, is that movie too strong? They fuck all the time. And they show everything? Let me show you what I learned. They're perverts. But they have a good time. Okay Pepito... ...but as soon as we're done, you leave. Okay sweetie, as soon as I come, I'll go. Margarita, there's a man on the terrace, maybe he's a spy. It must be a security guard or something. A security guard with binoculars? - Binoculars? - Yes! Wait. Let's go see. That's so obvious. See? I'm right. Do you think Gastón hired someone to watch me over? He's capable of anything. You know what? Let's call the police. - With all due respect. - Can you take us there? He's the security supervisor... ...if you want to talk to him, do it yourself. Yes, let's talk. So you can see I'm not making it up. Because the problem's no one says anything... Good night. - Good night. - Sergeant. These gentlemen want to talk to you. Please identify yourself. Of course. The sergeant's the law. Calm down we're checking. I'm a sergeant. I.D. Please. I was in the Putumayo for two and a half years. Putumayo. I'm the security supervisor here. This gentleman knows me. I told you who he was. And the binoculars? My work tools. - At this hour? - Then again you need them. What does that means? Let's have some light on here. It's a magazine I'm reading. Allow me sergeant. The sergeant's a man with weaknesses. I have to entertain myself up here. ...to entertain himself. Margarita Quiroz. She was the one who called. That's right. I hope you're not stalking her, are you? No, I'm not. I have a decent job. Some people, when they retire... Look, I have a PI agency, "The Universal", here... ...at your service. I told you he was cool. I'm watching her for 24 hours. Working... Partner... Isn't she in the movie I told you about. Of course, she's an actress. The girl's an actress. She's with someone else. Actress. She can really fuck. She fucks everyone. Okay Sergeant and what's our cut? If you can feed one, you can feed two... ...and if you can feed two, you can feed four. Sergeant. For you two. We'll talk later. She can have it. - Who is it? - The law, ma'am. Good night ma'am. Ma'am, he's the gentleman you reported as a suspect. We already check his I.D. And it's okay. Besides the guard identifies him as an honorable man. I have a decent job. The only one I could get was at night... ...and since I'm not afraid to work, I had to accept it. What do you do? I'm the security supervisor across the street. Tell me something, aren't you an actress? How did you figure it out? I've seen you at the Lido, miss. Can I ask for your autograph, miss? Would it be okay miss, if you sign one for me too? Sanchez Urquijo Felipe, miss. I'm Ochoa León Hector. Felipe. H, ctor. Kisses... ...and hughes. Thank you miss. Okay. Thank you guys. See you. At your service miss. At your service. Hi, stop hidding. I don't believe them. Gastón sent him. We have to be careful. That man is a nut case. You have to be careful, he won't do anything to me. We'll see. Gets up, kills and eats. Eats and kills. What do I have to do? I have a client for you. You owe me one. The deal's good. Belts are made of leather. Pinilla. Call the boss. Don Gastón. I have the man for you. The man gets out on Saturday. Don't delay him too much, the guards are watching. Go on, Rocha. Send him this way. At your service. I need you to kill someone. I don't know who he is yet. I'll know on Saturday. What do I have to do? Is he important? To me he is. How much will you charge me? That depends. If I have to find him, 200,000. If you tell me where he is, 100,000. If he's with someone, 200,000 more. If he's alone, 100,000. But I'm telling you one thing... ...if he has children or family, I won't do it. I consider it cursed money. Easy, he doesn't have any children. I wouldn't mess with him if he did. 300,000 then. I only have 150,000. Take it or leave it. Do something for me... ...let him have all the bullets. Give me the bullets. I've given you enough. I'm no Santa. Hey, pussy! Hey, pussy! Why don't you kill her instead? Motherfucker! Easy boss. I'll find out his name and we'll deal with him. Fabiola. Fabiola. What? What is this doing on your night table? Tell me. Clemente lit me a cigarette with it at six... ...when we changed shifts. Tell me. Did he come here afterwards? - I don't know. - Tell me. What time is it? Ask Clemente, maybe he has two of them. So, Did he or didn't he come afterwards? Diógenes, if you don't trust me, find out, you are a P.I. Yes, sure. Tell me something I can believe. You left your lighter on my night table. And Diógenes found it. Baby you're careless. I have to take care of everything. Who is it? Uncle Diógenes. Coming. Hi uncle, what are you doing here? Stop wasting my time, get dressed and start your shift. Yes, uncle. The actress saw me and sent the police over. - She can't be left alone. - Yes uncle, all right. Baby. Get dressed baby. I have to go to work. Hurry up! Wait a minute uncle. Have some coffee. Uncle, say Hi. Good night, miss. Good night, sir. Look what you left behind. Thanks uncle. I thought I'd lost it. I thought you coming here when we changed shifts? Yes. I was, but I had to make a long distance call... ...and considering public phones don't work, so... ...I went to the agency to make the call. I'll pay for it. I was tired, so I came home to rest to be ready at six. Thanks. Good-bye, sir. Good-bye, miss. So, baby? Wait a minute baby. Just a minute uncle, I'll walk her to the door. Just a minute. Don't start with me. Baby! Diógenes! - Do you think I'm stupid? - What's wrong with you? - Think I'm a fool? - Are you drunk? - Fool? - Diógenes, let me go. But what's wrong? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! - Let me go! ...something different... Let me go! What's up, uncle? Give me the camera. See something? No, nothing. See you at 18:00 hours. It's already eleven o'clock. Okay, I'll be back at 18:00 hours. Watch it when you leave. Don't let her see you. Okay. Ready boss. I have the patient. Who, the tall one? Let's do it, get him, now! Let's do some therapy on the tall guy. Not now Propio, not now! Grab him! The iron, devil, the iron... Who do I have to kill to please you? I didn't understand you clearly last night, pussy! Your lucky I'm leaving on Saturday... ...or I'd break your fucking neck! Be careful, motherfucker. When you let go your tongue, you let go your ass, fucker. Gonorrhea. Asshole. You creep. Prick. Fighting again. Take him to solitaire. Fabiola? Hello sweetheart. How was it last night, Okay? What woman? Wait a minute, let me explain. One minute... Wait! Why are you following me? No, why? I've been watching you for a long time. At the drugstore, at the shops, at the supermarket. To be honest... ...I wanted to ask you for an autograph. Only the officers got one last night. Who are you? Diógenes Hernandez at your service. Did you like my movies? Isn't that nice? What's that? To be an actress, to be able to change characters. It's not that great. To be honest... Come with me to my place and I'll give you a poster. I could never imagine you're a fan. From the start. When I called the police... ...I thought you were a P. I my husband hired to follow me. Is your husband a jealous man? Very much. I get so nervous sometimes. Are you nervous? A little... Do I make you nervous? A little... I'll be back soon. It'll just be a minute. How can you think that Fabiola? It was just someone to fool my uncle with. Don't you get it? To fool... Where did you find her, inside your cabinet? What cabinet? She's a neighbour, she was helping me out. What do you want? You want my uncle to find out! Is she younger? Are you tired of the wrinkles? No sweetie, you know... ...since I met you I haven't been with anyone else. Give me a kiss. Did you need a young girlfriend? Fresh flesh or what? Fucking shit!! Hi. Hi. What's with the faces? I don't want to go with you like this. Where's the attorney? He's not coming. We couldn't do anything. We couldn't pay bail. What? They didn't give us the money. We've been running around offices... ...thinking they'd give us something and at the end... ...they gave us some bonds. - Cashable in six months. Besides, no one wants to buy them. Fuck God! Hey Gastón we've done everything we could. Tomorrow is Saturday. Rocha. Not here. I need a cigarette. Cigarette. François. François, It's Gastón. I need to ask you a favor. Yes, listen to me. I'm in deep shit. Gastón, not again please. I've been helping you for the last three months. I've been handling your affairs. What else do you want? What will I do with those bonds, I don't want them. Well, just to help you, send your wife with the bonds... ...and let's see what can I do with them. Okay François. François, one thing, don't tell them about Margarita. Of course, how can you think that? Don't you trust me? Don't you know me? Okay. Okay, bye. Hello? Don't get jealous on me... ...who was I supposed to be talking with? Will you be released this weekend? That's nice, I'll pick you up. See, It's always the same... ...you're jealous and you go out with her all the time... ...one minute... Hello? I just came out of the shower, I'm all wet. Clemente! Fernandez! If you want to call, it's free. Is it free lady? It's free, you don't need coins. Lady can you please help me? I'll dial the number, and you'll ask for someone. Is it to wrong someone? I don't like pranks. On the contrary, lady. Okay. A good deed... My pleasure. Whom do you want to speak with? - Clemente Fernandez, Pepe. - Okay. It's ringing. Hello, "The Universal" P. I agency at your service? Is Clemente Fernandez there? Pepe? From a friend. It's from a friend. Pepe. Phone. A friend. Hello? This is Clemente Fernandez... Hello? What's wrong with you sir... No, It's my problem lady. Yes but, I feel I can help you. Hello? There's no one there. Why are you hanging up? You want me to leave so you can speak? Fabiola, no one's there. See for yourself! Was she last night's girl, or a new one? No one there? So I'm crazy. Why are you like this. No one was there! Like what? Don't give out my number, get it? Tell them not to call you here. No one was there, sweetheart. So I'm the crazy one. I'm stupid, don't touch me. No one was on the fucking phone! You know what? You need to get closer to God. Take this rosary. It's not enough but... ...the virgin can help you. She's your guide towards God. Keep it and ask the virgin to lead you towards God. He's going to solve your problems. - You're very kind. - God loves you, think about it. Fabiola... ...Hi. I'm going to be late. Clemente will replace me at 18:00. Is he over there? No? I have something to do... See you tonight. Pepe. Why did she asked for Pepe? - Why Pepe? - I don't know why. She almost called you Pepito. Do they all call you Pepe? - Will you calm down? - Your name is... ...Clemente Fernandez. She didn't ask for Mr. Fernandez, or Fernandez... Pepe, Pepe... Stop it, are you crazy? Sargeant. Just 'cause you're passing by, you think you're not paying? I've been waiting for weeks. I need you to pay up! What are you looking at? They're always together! Don't fuck with me now. Fabiola! Open up! Fabiola! Clemente! Were you suppose to be early today? Diógenes. Are you crazy? What's wrong with you? Clemente please! Clemente, don't hit your uncle! Clemente! Stop fighting! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Fuck, stop it! Leave him Diógenes! You're gonna kill him, Diógenes! Careful, you're gonna kill him! Stop it! You're gonna kill him! How long have you been fucking him, you bitch? My gun... I'll kill this pussy! Uncle, how can you think that! Are you crazy? Having sex with who? Show some Respect! Uncle! Don't hit me! Don't you hit me! Look! What are you doing? Where the fuck is my gun? I'll kill this pussy! He's a son of a bitch! Fucker! Shoot him man! Go in and see for yourself! Hitting women, aren't we? Sick! Fucker! Fucker! Look at how you left me! Don't even think I'm a moron. You were having it! You wouldn't believe... You did pay me! I'll pay you later! Pussy! Here, if it gets cold. Slut! Bitch! - Slut! - Fucking murderer. All dwarfs like to fight. Pussy! Yes, It's here. It can't be. Have you seen the movie? It can't be. Yes. Look at the name in the poster: Gastón Arzuaga. What kind of business does your husband have? No, he hands out the money. It's his business. What do you think is feeding us? Nice business! Hey! Hey! Hey! Mr. Bassil's office? Yes, that way. Thank you. It can't be! It's here. Peanuts, sweets, cigarettes... Tickets. No. We're going to Mr. Bassil's office. That's what I'm saying. You have to buy the tickets... May be you didn't understand. We're not here for the movie, we're going to an office. That's what I'm saying. Buy the tickets to come in. Buy the tickets 'cause if I hear him say... "That's what I'm saying" again, I'll go mad. They saw all the posters and they didn't say a thing? Aljure, stop the projection and put in reel four. Do it! I'm trying to get over him. Yes, come in. Mr. Bassil please? It's me. What can I do for you? We represent Gastón Arzuaga, you know him, don't you? Of course. Come in. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Hello. Hello. And Margarita? Who's Margarita? ...Gastón's wife. She's coming to sell me some bonds. No, I'm his wife, and here are the bonds. I knew something like this would happen. Shut up mother. Who is Margarita? Well... It's her, the actress in the movie, look. ... like everyone, same as always is boring. Do you want it here? Or is it too cold? Do you want to listen to your heartbeat? Yes, Doctor! Hey. Wasn't she the woman we saw in jail last time? Yes, of course. Of course. Of course it's her. Now I understand everything. That's why she was looking at me. The actor... ...he's the actor who was killed... ...the reason why Gastón's in jail. Shut up girl. Gastón doesn't deserve you. I've told you before. He has never deserved you. Look ladies. Calm down. I didn't want to tell you, I was very naive. I never meant to upset you. Calm down! Actually I should thank you. I really thank you very much. I had to find out eventually. I always... ...gave Gastón some advice but... ...he never listened to me... ...and now... ...he's in jail. If he's in jail for her, let her get him out. It's incredible. It's unbelievable. It was about time, after 10 years. One thing is to be unfaithful and another to be a murderer. He was capable of killing for her. He never would have killed for me! Okay. Take it easy. You want a brandy or something? No, all I want to do is... ...to settle the bond thing. The bonds. I don't want them. They're from the government. And cashable in six months. Nobody buys them. But if you want... ...I'll buy them just because I want to help you. I'll give you 50% of their value now. In cash. Is it ok? Yes, whatever. I just want to get out of here. You want them in pesos or dollars? No, in dollars. What do we want pesos for? We want to get out of here as soon as possible. Are you with someone? No, alone. Alone? What are you going to do with all that cash? If you want to, I'll go with you. At last! At last, a gentleman. My pleasure! Do you like emeralds? Very much. I'll give you this one as a present. Beautiful. Fabiola. Don't press so hard, baby! How could you let him hit you like this... ...if he's smaller than you? I also hit him hard. Clemente, go to the station and drop the charges. No. Later. We can be alone for a while. You're right. We'll be alone at least one time. Right! Sergeant Hernandez? Sergeant Hernandez? Sergeant Hernandez? How about that! How about that the law's in jail. Here he is, there's a leak. Sergeant Hernandez? - Sergeant Hernandez? - Here Sergeant. Doctors can die too. Are you deaf or what? No, sergeant. Denying what he is. - Denying our institution? - No, sergeant. Wear your uniform with pride. - I respect it. - He plays in both sides. And you, stop fucking around. Open! Easy brother. Let's kick the shit out of this snitch. Talk it over with your wife. The law taught you, you can fix everything by talking. Don't play the rough side. That's what got you in here with those rats. Careful. Don't let anyone hit you like that. It's not manful. Thanks, serge. Believe me. I don't like this. Even worst considering I'm the law... ...I've always been at the good side of justice. Thanks. I felt goosebumps... As I looked at the skull... It's sphere look as if... ... it was laughing at me... ... and I was laughing at it. Looking at it, so bald and angry. Hi uncle! The girl hasn't left since I arrived. Uncle. I've never disrespected you. If I cause you any distress please forgive me. I don't want to fight or endanger our friendship. On the contrary. I'm grateful. You're the only one who has helped since I came here. You know there's nothing between Fabiola and me. Your woman is sacred to me. Ask me for any proof, Anything... ...anything... ...anything... ...as long as we fix this without violence. Excuse me for kicking your ass, son. I apologize for hitting you too. Apology, my ass. You didn't touch me. Don't laugh you big pussy. You're drunk. I'd better stay. Take those binoculars off. Don't be a snitch. Working too hard, are we? I expect you at the office at 09:00. Go directly home. Okay. Snitch. Snitch! Snitch! What a snitch! You're all drunk... ...and you look like shit, poor baby. No, know what? I didn't fell down. No? No, I got home... ...and found my nephew fucking my woman. Who did this to you, your nephew or your wife? I wouldn't let a woman do this to me. What really pisses me off is I didn't catch them doing it... ...I just got close to the door and heard the moans. I threw down the door and turned the place into a riot. Luckely I didn't find my gun or who knows... ...what would have happened. Fuck me 'cause I'll kill you. No. They all came over me. My nephew got his share too. Did you hit your wife? I wouldn't hit a woman. Why did you do that? We were doing the same thing yesterday. It is different. No, It's not. Nobody knows anybody else's thirst. You know what? Want to know something. I'm a private P. I hired by Gastón Arzuaga to spy you. I already knew that. That's why I brought you over here. I thought... ..."He knows too much, he must be neutralized". Easy girl, we've sinned together. It's in our best interest to keep this to ourselves. Yes, you're right. When you left yesterday I was worried... ...you would tell Gastón all about François. I'll tell the Spaniard you go to bed early and alone. What a lie! I was worried, I thought you hated it. Gastón couldn't do it the last two times. That's what I'm saying, Begona. It's unbelievable. It's incredible. Unbelievable. How could he? I can't be at ease 'cause we left him alone. Don't say stupid things. He has someone to care for him. When he gets out he'll go back to you. And if he doesn't, it'll be better. Don't say that. He's the girl's father. Well... Hey, Give me some dollars. I'm going to buy matching earrings for the emerald... ...that fat man gave me. Hey. Here. Buy some more emeralds. They're cheap here. We can sell them over there. It's pretty. You like it? Thanks, Mr. Gastón. So nice of you. Thank you Mr. Gastón, I'll use this a lot. Mr. Gastón could you please give me your blanket. I really need it, cause mine is all... What happened to the Chinese balls, man? Please give me your address 'cause I want to visit you. You'll have to swim. And the robe? It'll be very useful. You like the robe? It's yours Rocha. Be careful with the Brandy, Rocha. François. Shut up you sound like chicken! - Easy, I'm leaving. - What are you doing here? I have a letter from your wife. From Margarita? Why isn't she here? Well... I don't know, maybe she'll come this afternoon. I have to go. I'll see you this afternoon. I'll see you this afternoon. François. Thanks François. Bye. Thank you François. Mr. Gastón. No one has told me, I'll let you out and get in trouble. Did they say anything? Don Gastón. I want you to remember about the blanket. Did they say something, Mr. Gastón. Fuck Begona! Fuck her mother! Fuck Colombia! Fuck God! François! François! - Motherfucker! - What's up? - What did you tell Begona? - Nothing. What did you tell her? Motherfucker! Son of a bitch! What does she say? How did she know about Margarita? - I didn't do anything! - Motherfucker! You were the only one who knew about her. Hands off! Fuck you! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! My money! My money! Motherfucker! Motherfucker! This guy's crazy. Guard, open the door. Can you spare some bread. Bread. For the little dog... ... for the prettiest dog in Bogota. Can you give us bread... ... for Susanita. The prettiest dog... ... called Susanita! Can you spare some bread. For the little dog... ... for the prettiest dog in Bogota... ... called Susanita. Can you give us bread... ... bread... ... for the little dog... ... for the prettiest dog in Bogota... Can you... Hi uncle. How was it last night? Okay. Everything was normal. Is your phone working? Yes it is, they fixed it. Everything's okay. Go home, then. I'll go to jail to see the Spaniard and I'll call you. Home? If you want uncle, I'll watch over the girl... ...while you see the Spaniard in jail. No problem. No, it's not necessary. Go home and wait for my call, got it? Okay Uncle. I'll wait for your call. You'll call me, right? Don't forget. Do you want an egg or are you leaving again? This morning you left without a word... ...you left breakfast on the table... Fabiola. I'm sorry but... ...I really love you very much... ...it hurts to think you're with another... ...you know... ...you know as a man it hurts to know... ...someone's messing with your woman. We have to be serious around him, Fabiola. If he sees guilt he'll know for sure. We'll get into deep shit with my uncle. No Clemente. That's an excuse. You're going to leave me... ... for the one who called the other day, Clemente. No, you're gonna use this to leave me. No, I'll do anything, anything you ask. Promise you won't go? No baby, I won't go. Clemente, don't touch me like that. No, they can see us through the window. Take your clothes off! Take your clothes off! Clemente, I think Diogenes is gonna be late. No, don't do that to me, please. Fast! Fast! I knew it. I knew it. Margarita. Clemente Fernandez. Who is he? He's a Gigolo. An actor. She's with him all day long. How did you get this picture? It's my job, isn't it? Women. Women. You're 100,000 short. It's all I have... ...next week I'll give you the rest. Give me your watch. We'll talk next week. Mr. Gastón. Rocha. I need you to do something for me. Mr. Gastón. We need money. The boys don't have any money and they're loosing it. Since you're gonna be here longer. Rocha. Give me a couple of days. You have to do something for me. Go to section five, talk to Propio, tell him to come... ...I need to speak with him 'cause I can't go out. Calm down. A man never kneels down. I'll help you. But give me something. Something at least. Take this baby Jesus so he protects you. - Yes mom. - Daddy. - Wait a minute, baby. - Daddy. It's not this way. Are we almost there? Yes mom, we're near. ...82... ...84, a bit further... ...86. It's over here, mom. Don't stop in front! What am I, stupid? No mom, you're blessing. When we stop, son. - Okay, mom. - Don't be late, ok? No, I'll waste this Fernandez fast. Hello, "The Universal" at your service? He's not available at the moment. Do you want to leave a message? How is he? What's up? Someone shot Clemente. Did they kill him, or what? They don't know. Let's go then. The dead one's here. The dead one's here? Get his eyes! Hey lady, no! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Let them in, they're the people of La Universal. - Excuse me! - Let me in! You, go there. Clemente, what did they do to you? Mister, help me! Clemente, my love. My God! My God! Lady! Easy! Take it easy! Let me go! Let me go, don't touch me! Don't touch me! Fuck off! Don't touch me! Kids have to stay out. Clemente! Clemente my love! Give him some air! Fast! Fast! Clemente! Easy serge. She'll get over it. You know women. - Give him eternal rest. - Eternal light shine on him. Give him eternal rest. Eternal light shine on him. - Give him eternal rest. - Eternal light shine on him. - Give him eternal rest. - Eternal light shine on him. - May he rest in peace. - Amen. In the name of the father, the son and the Holy Ghost. Ever since I was a boy. I wanted to do something, to own something. I don't have anything, but I have everything. Here, have some. I started working with the law. Sergeant Hernandez! Time goes by, I get married and I fall in love, Fabiola. But no children. Why do you want kids, they're an inconvenience. The world... ...seems boring. I have to start from scratch again. From scratch. Easy, you'll work it out. Work it out? I remember when I was a kid my mother use to say... ...by the time you grab your head, it'll be too late. Why? Who is it? I don't know. François is in Girardot... ...and Gastón's in jail. What a weird day. Who is it? Flowers from Mr. Gastón Arzuaga. Coming! They're very pretty. Can you put them there? Is here okay? - Buy yourself a soda. - Thanks. Could you sign the receipt? - Thank you. - Okay. Have a good day. Gastón's so sweet. Since he couldn't get out... ...he sent me Orchids... ...my favorites. They're bad luck. Yes? Which ones do you like? I prefer Marguerites. Do you like this one? I love it! Yes? It's so delicious. Sergeant! Delicious! Sergeant! So obvious! A dead man is a dead man. And it's worth money. That Fernandez is still alive, so... So? What do we care? How can we charge him? Shut up! What do we care if he's half alive? Anyway the other one was fucking his woman. That's got to cost something. If he doesn't want to pay for Fernandez as a whole... ...He'll have to pay half. That's two and a half. - Okay, mom. - Understood? - Yes mom. Take me home. - What's with the accent? Are you from the valley? I have to take a shower, I stink. You have reached "The Universal" PI agency. No secret can resist us. Please leave a message and we'll get back to you. Sergeant Hernandez. I need to know who's the man they found with her. Find out. I'll call you later. And about your money...
