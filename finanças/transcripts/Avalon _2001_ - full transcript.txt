You're not ready for Class A yet. You might want work a little more on B. Well played, Ash. As always. You're still as good as ever were. Talk to me for one clip of 7.62mm... ...and two clips of PPK. You'll be advanced to the next level soon. You just have two or three missions left to complete This won't be any easy. And off cours you'll have a time handicap to deal with. You know that, don 't you? Give me the rest of my points in cash. Playing solo gets more dangerous the further you go. Are you sure you don't want to try a team? Good game, Ash. Shoot perfectally! Remaids me of Ash! This guy is better. He is much faster. Move! Ash... The circults haven't been cleared yet. Even you have to wait your turn, after all. Fine, I just have to ask you, then. Ask me! I need some help. I can't advice lndividual players, Ash. You know that as well as I do. It wouldn't be fair I want information about another player. A 'Bishop' who just cleared Class A. The terminal shows nothing on this guy. I just would like to know who he is, thats all. Why are you interested? Because he is hunting me. I tought you never made personal contact with another player under any circunstances. Every one for thenselfs. Is not how you play the game? 'Avalon... '...faraway isle of legend... '...of apple groves... '...and mist... 'Avalon... 'When will that day come? 'Avalon... 'Isle of faery... '...where heroes go... 'Avalon... 'A hero takes ship... '...and sets sail... '...to that isle of legend... 'Avalon... 'To the Nine Sisters... '...and Avalon... 'There together... '...on that holy isle. 'O Arthur... '...your ship sets sail... '...over the misty water to Avalon.' It's you... You're looking well. I hear things, you know? People is always teling you what is going on. I don't know why, I gess because they know I used to be a bigshot. Wizard, my name still means a lot, you know. It's a blessing and a curse... Anyway, I make around the different tops, I hear things... ...sometimes things I really wish I didn't hear, I know what I mean?. Maybe it's karma. Anyway, I start to hear about this solo player... ...who was suppose to be really good, and that it's a woman, too. So, I started wondering just would may be, and what do you know? How long did you take? For what? For you track me down. I little, Just dumb luck. Rather then cross my mind is meaning like this.... You know, maybe is like fate giving us a second chance or somethig. I wish I was a Warrior like you. Then I could play solo. I'm a thief and who in the hell ever heard about of a solo Thief? We are not like a team. We scout our supplies,... snoop around, scalp head... We're like tour guides. How do you know any team won't be lock to have you, Stunner. God how long it's been since anyone called me that. Look at all of us, the hole Wizard crew... we still hate each other. and everybody else... ...they don't like us much either. Is like a curse. I thoght a team Wizard was good to make my carrer, but instead is been like... ...a kiss of dead. Merge us to go... I don't wanna hear it. OK then. Whatever you say. I don't have time to rehash the old days. Ash... No need to thank me. I wasn't going to. Have you heard about Murphy? Oops, I gess it. You haven't heard it... Hey, if you'll throw this... Our old friend Murfy went solo, too. And then... He never came back. You came visiting him... or what is left of him. They got them out of the clinic with the rest of the jelly fish... The unreturned, is the way they like to call them. Personally I wouldn't go near the place. Too much reality, you know hat I mean? You must've heard the stories... About the hidden character in the field Class A levels of the game. A 'neutral character' that appears out of nowhere. A little girl... ...with sad eyes, who doesn't say a word. Some people think she's a hysteric planted by the programmers. Some think she's a bug in the system. They call her 'the ghost'. Whatever she is one thing for sure... ...no one who goes after her ever make its back. So... Why would anybody with any sense go after her, right? C'mon Ash, even someone who keeps to youself as much as you, must have heard of a special A ...a secret level you can't reset to scape... ... a level that go to be played to the end... It's a killer... ... who agree that the difficult is out of the charts... But then... the number of experience points you could get. They say this girl "the ghost" is the only gate to that level. So thats why players go looking for her. And go after her when they find her. If they want to get to Special A... ...they've got to chase the ghost. Just like Murphy did. Stunner! Split off! I need you to draw off the way! Copper! Cuisinart! Masher! We need cover now! Murphy.! We 're almost down with ammo! We go to pull back! Can you hold yourself? This team does not call reset! Just do your job, dammit. Ash! Ash! Here Arthur lies, King once and King to be. My ID data What for?! That is cool... What is taking so long? That is cool! That's cool! Ruins 666! Those would be the coordenates. Is very busy out there in Class A today. Watch out for time-lags. Have you heard of 'the Nine Sisters'? No Ash. Live it be... You are giving an adivice? If so, is not for your sake, mearly for the sake of the game - Avalon... You have a gift... Players of your caliber bring instability to the whole network. If you get lost, the game would suffer. There are forces at work... Forces you don't understand... Stay focused in the game... Don't be distracted Lets sleep in ghost's lime. I misfocused as I every was, game master And my object has not changed. You should know it by now... To be the first to reach the highest level of Avalon... But now I find the game has changed... And somehow they hold the key... This bishop and the nine sisters A key can open doors... or it can lock you in. Some riddle may not be worth the risk of solving... Nobody win the game without solving it. That's the only thing about the riddle I know for sure. I think Murphy new that too. Alright, log me on. Wait, wait! Hold your fire! I'm Jill, of team 'The Nine Sisters'. It's a honor to meet the great 'Ash'. Welcome, Ash. What bring someone like you to our naked woods. I want information. And I expect you want something in return, won't you? Cut to the chase, hein? I'm about to take all your gear. What do you say? People will pay good cash for the data that is stored on that equipment. You know selling the player's data is against the rules. Ye, well, the guys got a word on living. Even Avalon! What is 'Special A'. You wouldn't really! OK, the real "Nine Sisters"... The ones we took our name from... they are the only ones who might know. Even if they do, I don't think they''ll tell you... So, who are those 'Nine Sisters' I keep hearing about? They're the ones who originally programmed this game. Murphy! A time-lag! Bastards! Sorry I messed up your game room. It's all right. Everyone mess days like that. From Scythia to Camelot C. Scott Littleton & Linda A. Malcor The Legend of King Arthur Richard Cavendish The Chronicles of King Arthur Andrea Hopkins A Kaleidoscope of Arthurian Legend Toshiyuki Takamiya Ash... ...you look a little pale. You are recovering from a reset or what? OK, come down! Look, I though of something. You're interested in find the gate to Special A? You know, the ghost? I think I can help you, if you are. You wanna get some breakfast, Ash? You really need to eat more, you know? So, anyway, like I was saying... .. there was this team that lost a few people, and... They told me that... ...when the ghost appears... ...there's always a Bishop around somewhere. They said that's the one common link between all the sitings. Bishop? Don't ask me why... ...but the ghost never appears without one of them around. So, a Bishop? Any kind of Bishop? No, that's the thing. Some fools think they hookup with any old Bishop, and go 'ghost hunting'. Doesn't work like that! They found that out the hard way... So, what kind of bishop? Exactly! He has to be... really good. At list... Class A Level 12 or higher. And the other bishop, you are just wasting your time... So? You thinking about it? Won't make the switch? 'Warrior' to bishop? This is the only way to find the ghost, ahn? As a solo or never... Well, Murphy was solo after all. Ye, but, my god, a Level-12 Bishop... Hey... ...what level are you? 12? 13? Of course you need more then that... To switch the bishop you need double the experience points. You know that is not a piece of cake. Look at Murphy. ...took him forever... whole lot a time, whole of a cash... Stiling ended up with about as many points as anyone, I gess... Even so... Didn't do much good in the end, did he? I wouldn't be able to do it... You could if you have a team... Of course, with your recent record, who's would want to join you? Forguet it. You are right. I mean, look at you... you're less perfect. why mess the things up? Ash... You are right... I don't think you couldn't do it, even if you try it. Maybe if... Murphy was still here... Thanks. Seeing you around. How did you find me? As the good book says... Seek and ye shall find. Actually... it's you who is been looking for me, isn't Ash? Real meat... ...real vegetables... ...rice... It's a very lucky dog, you've got. He eats better than most humans, I know. Real alcohol... ...cigarettes... ...knowledge you can't get from a terminal. Behold, the fruits of Avalon... ...the privilege of a solo player. Of course, for the best players the game itself is own reward, isn't it? I've checked you out, Ash. You talked to Stunner? The ability to analyze data... ...is one of the most important skills of a Bishop. You were a Warrior in team Wizard. The team disbanded. Is always been speculation as to exactly why. The details... remains something of a mystery... There been many theories, but the most popular one... ...is that a certain Warrior... disobeyed orders... ...panicked on the fire... ...and called 'reset'. Ash! Do you ready me ? Aim for the cockpit! Take out the pilot! Coming, Ash? Ash, are you there? Ash! The team is cutted off... ...is in danger of being wiped out. Someone cracks in the pression. It happens all the time. The only unusual thing on this case... ...is that it was never suppose to happen to the invincible Wizard. I want us to form a team. Standard setup of six members. Me and two other Warriors, a Thief, of course... ...and, if possible, a Mage. And me? Aren't you going to ask what I want? And would you tell me? I will. Once we're in Avalon. Be at Flak Tower 22... ...tomorrow... midnight. I'd like to close now. I'm suppose to meet someone in Avalon at midnight. He is going to help me find Special A. You want find what you're thinking you are looking for, you know. Not inside Avalon. Even though it looks real... even though it feels real... Avalon is still only a game... ...but a game you cannot win is no longer a game... Why do you suppose it's hidden on a secret level? There is a reason they keep it of limits... Who are you? Just like you, I was once approached by a Bishop. Though in my case, he was looking for a administrator. Not a player. Who is 'Bishop'? Someone with special access previleges. He doesn't logon from a hub, but his own terminal. He comes and goes as he pleases. People can you do that? You and I can't. But, of course, just about anything is possible... when you are one of the people running the game. Take my advice, Ash. Don't try to get in Special A. I must! Why? Murphy's in there. Ah, I see... Use Room 9. The Game Master's waiting. Thank you. I've input your coordinates. As you know, I'd prefer you didn't go through this Ash. I'm sorry. I have to. A good game master... ...does not intervene. Tell me something... What am I talking to when I talk to you? Are you accessing the system from a terminal somewhere? ...or are you part of the system itself? You mean: Am I real? Does it matter? All right. Log me on. I want to thank you for helping me. There is no need, you're been here as a benefit to me as well. So, did you find out who I am? You know what I think? You're one of the Nine Sisters... ...the ones who originally design the program. I'm their successor. The "Nine Sisters" created Avalon... My job is to preserve it. Then it's true! You're not a player. You're on the inside. Would you like to join me? Before I join the team, I'd like to know who owns it. Don't worry about them. They're only ciphers, mass of data. They don't really exist. Ash... Witch is the greatter challenger? Which is the better game? Witch you do choose, keeping one choice? The sort of game you think you can win? But Can't... or alternativally... one that seens to be impossible, but isn't. maintaining a precise delicate balance somewhere in between... ... through every level of the game... That's what keeps it going... ...and it's all up to us... Right. Now we're all here. It's time to go. Good to be working with you again, Ash. Did you pick your lunch? I'm sure there is nothing in front of us. I don 't like lt... Ash...go up top. Mechanic, Ivan, Brody...forward. Give me a break! Big troble up hear, they gonna citadel! How we are suppose to pass that? Come down. This is a field Class A mission. Did you think it will be simple? We just have to change our tatics... Even that thing has a wick spot... Ash... ...we'll get out in front and slow down it. You go around behind it... and aim for the grill. Bishop! What the hell are you trying? To get the rest of team killed? Forget about the size. Just get it down! They're are decoys! Keep moving! Don't waste your fire! Where is the ghost? Stunner! That was my only chance... Looks like... I screw up again... Again'? You saw her, right? The ghost... Wait until she leaves the wall, and take your shot. That's when you can get her... The ghost is the gate... get the ghost and you are in. You will made the Special A. Say hello to Murphy. It wasn't your fault, Ash. You know that, don't you? What happen to the wizard then. I was the one who get scared... I'm the one who call for Reset... I always, I always I wanted to tell Murphy that. Ash! Get moved! The ghost won't wait for you forever. I was right. I knew you'll be the player to make it thought the gate. Is this 'Special A'? We call lt 'Class Real'. Its design is far more sophisticated then any level of the game you've seen. However, the one thing you have to do in order to complete it... ...is quite simple... So, there is another mission? For the unreturned is here, an illegal player. Track him down and eliminate him from the game. In essence you will be acting as a debuger, removing a virus from the system. Before it can spread. Your only weapon is that pistol... ...and one clip that is in it. The other people you see are neutrals, not players... If you kill or injure a neutral... you loose the game. There's no time limit. And there is no way to exit... before the level is completed. If you get back safely... ...you can then, be one of us. Any questions? Yes, why have you brought me here? You brought yourself, Ash. Remember that! Only you know why... Now you have everything you need so. If there are no more questions, lets begin. Look behind you. You may find more then one familiar face here. Good hunting, Ash. 'Avalon, faraway isle of legend... '...of apple groves and mist... 'Avalon, when will that day come? 'Isle of faery, where heroes go...' Why did you come, Ash? Was because of me? Why not? That surprises you? Do you ever know our team is disbanded? I always had suspicions, but I kept my mouth shut. I even let people think I called 'reset'. Why coundn't you left me alone? Stunner told me you were lost. But I suspected you know just what you were doing. He travels fast as he travels alone... Right? The rest of us was content to being a team, but you weren't. You wanted to go all the way... We were just holding you back... You had to find a way to get rid of us. ...you set us up to loose, knowing that cut tear us apart... Is that what you wanted? For this you abandoned us all? ...to spend the rest of your life as a hollow shell in a hospital bed staring at nothing? How can you be so sure? Do I look like a hollow shell? Do I? Reality is... only what we tell ourselfs. That's all! I choose this one. I'd prefer this reality... What you call choice, I call something else... I call it running away! But, what if this world is where we really belong? For example: Tell me, how do you explain what's happened to your hair? That streak of grey... How could it disappear? ...could it be the determinant part of the game? Not reallity... Imagine what is like to actually be shot? To experience that pain... We are not in the game now, Ash. Does it really have to be this way? When one of us dies... ...and that body doesn't vanish as usual... ...then you know what is real. '...so many of the brave are cut down... '...and heroes lay fallen. 'As bright, shining death approaches... '...the spectres appear... '...and shroud them in darkness... '...as black night ends. Ash... Don't listen what they tell you. Never go back! This world... Right here... ...is where you belong. 'Avalon, the heroes set out... '...for that isle of legend... 'Avalon, isle of spirits... 'Avalon, heaven of shadows... 'Now, with the Nine Sisters... '...across the misty water... '...the ship sets sail... '...to Avalon.' Subs by Caradecuica
