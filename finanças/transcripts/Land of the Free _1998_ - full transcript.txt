[music playing] AIDAN: We can do it. It's up to us, the people, to make this country great. [cheering] [chanting "carvell"] I am here-- I am here to speak for you, all of you-- the old, the sick, you who've been ignored by your country. I will be your voice. I will be your conscience. I have felt your pain. I know what you want-- pride in your country, health for your children, security. What happened to those men in Washington? Why have they forgotten you? Because they've been there too long, with their hands out, their fingers taking your money, your freedom, your opportunity. And if you leave them in office, they will take your life. [cheering] My triumph will be your triumph. [cheering] Together, we will make a difference. [cheering] [chanting "carvell"] Thank you. [chanting "carvell"] [music playing] [gunshot] [gunfire] [music playing] [horn honking] [tires screeching] [music playing] [horn honking] [music playing] [horn honking] [tires screeching] [music playing] [tires screeching] [music playing] [gunshot] What the hell'd you do that for? [music playing] REPORTER: OK. He's been called a maverick by "The Washington Post" and a true patriot by "The Wall Street Journal." Along with his trademark million-dollar smile, he's here today, among other things, to talk about his number one bestselling book, "Land of the Free." California's candidate for the US Senate and founder of Free America, Aidan Carvell. Thank you, Barney, and welcome to my home. You are pitching the most controversial program on drugs, crime, and education, and you're still leading in the polls. How are you doing that? I simply want freedom and fairness. The voters want freedom and fairness. I can't please everyone. But the American public seems to be responding. Responding indeed. Your closest competition is what, 20 points behind? Well, I'm very pleased with the way the campaign is going. And I credit, uh, much of my success to my book. Is this a shameless plug? Shameless. Gentlemen hate to break this up, but we've got a 5 o'clock with the environmentalists. Tree huggers. Oh, Frank Jennings, my campaign manager. Yeah. Well, the way the campaign is going, you ought to be able to write your own ticket. Well, I'm just trying to put the civil back in civilization. I gave him that one. - Aidan, thank you. - Thanks for coming. FRANK: No, Stu. He can't make it. He's in Long Beach all day. So forget about it. All right. Then try to get us in on Friday. Oh, that's a good idea, the kind of bitch and moan thing. That's always worked well for you in the past. [beep] Jerk. Who are you talking to? One of your ex-boyfriends, I think. Oh, not a chance. I only had one boyfriend, and I married him. - Oh, who's that? - Yeah. FRANK: Hey, duck. Tommy Jeffers has a rocket with real fireworks inside. Mom said I could get one. It said ages 10 and up on the box. Well, if you're mom says it's OK, it's all right with me. Cool. ANNIE: I'm gonna take him to school. You have any lunch plans? Well, what do you got in mind? The usual. I am available. Hey, you know, maybe I can make it over and see your soccer practice today, huh? Give. - Quack. That a boy. [phone ringing] All right. Come on, pal. Bye. - Bye. Get out of here. Jennings. FITZPATRICK: Frank, this is Fitz. Hey, Fitz. My favorite gumshoe. What's up? FITZPATRICK: You got a few minutes today to talk? Um, you know, the campaign's killing me. I don't think I have any time today at all. FITZPATRICK: You need to find the time for me. Sounds serious. FITZPATRICK: Meet me in an hour at the bridge. Yeah, sure. OK. FITZPATRICK: An interesting name came across my desk-- Aidan Carvell. Well, I guess I'm doing my job then, huh? What I read wasn't for mass consumption. So I thought I'd look into the details. You know anything about the Northern Militia? The what? All right. There's these guys in the office. All right? They're very good at what they do. Now, they've linked that militia's funding to campaign contributions. Yeah, that's right-- your campaign. This is ridiculous. Carvell's interested in a seat in the Senate, not in some kind of a war. See, this is exactly the kind of thing that happens when you start shaking things up in Washington. All right. Did you ever hear anything unusual or see anything? Uh, conversations, documents, anything that would implicate Carvell or anyone on the campaign? No. Oh, damn it. Oh. Ah, an Annapolis man with dirty shoes. That'll never do, sailor. Yeah. Hey, Fitz. Yeah? You don't really believe any of this shit, do you? All right, look, maybe our information's wrong. OK? Maybe someone's using Carvell's money, an insider. But if this fiction becomes fact, major shit's gonna go down. These are dangerous people. I'd just hate to see you get burned. Yeah, thanks. All right, I tell you what-- um, I'll let you know if I hear anything more. Oh, and, uh, you owe me a shoeshine. FRANK: They're religious extremists, Carla. They have to say that. No. No, listen. Listen to me. Use the quote from "The LA Times" to launch the campaign. Spin. Spin, Carla. This is why I hired you. All right, look-- yeah. Get some rest. I'll call you tomorrow. [music playing] Hey. Talk to me. Hi. The, uh, ratings from the talk show are through the roof. Networks have been running our sound bites all day. Everything's just great. Love it. Car's ready. I'll be right there. I'm going to Colorado. I'll be back Sunday. Well, I'll pack. No, no, no. It's a family thing. You got a copy of Friday night's speech I can look at on the plane? FRANK: Uh, I'm working on it as we speak. Can I see it now? Uh, well, you can see it when it's done. Better be great. It'll be great. It'll be incredible. [music playing] Over there. [music playing] Agent Luckenbill, FBI! That's Agent Green. You're Frank Jennings, aren't you? You all right? What do you want? Fitzpatrick said we should talk to you. Said we could help each other. If this is gonna be a conversation about this, uh, secret militia stuff, you got the wrong man. Yeah? We can trace six arms transactions back to his campaign accounts, Frank. So he can what, blow up all the districts that don't vote for him? I mean, come on, guys. Give me a break. It appears that this group is responsible for several high-tech military ordinance burglaries. We think Aidan Carvell is up to his ass involved. Well, you're wrong. Aidan Carvell is an honest man, and he loves his country. We did a little homework on you, Lieutenant. Snuck a peak at your Naval records. Quite impressive. Graduated with honors from the Academy, Naval Intelligence for five years. It also said you're a principled man with extremely high standards. AGENT GREEN: Please understand what it is we're dealing with here. This group is stockpiling weapons. I mean, as crazy as this sounds, these people are trying to take over the country. You're right. It does sound crazy, and I don't believe it. Matt McCaster, Carvell's security chief? Ex FBI. Foiled a political assassination attempt eight years ago. Got a big promotion until the Bureau found out he staged the whole thing. That sound familiar? [music playing] Can you guys prove any of this? Not yet. That's why we need your help. We need access to Carvell's computer. AGENT GREEN: And on the off chance Carvell comes up clean, we pack up and leave. No harm, no foul. Think about it. [music playing] Keep in touch. [music playing] Hey. Hi. What are you doing up so early? Mmm, couldn't stop thinking about what you told me last night. I just can't believe what's going on. Aidan's been like a second father to me. Well, can you talk to him? Um, maybe there's a-- a logical explanation. Yeah, maybe. Problem is, what if there's not? [music playing] I love you, honey. [music playing] My triumph is your triumph. [music playing] [door closing] [music playing] Well, working late? [elevator dinging] Yeah. [music playing] Hey, Frank. How'd you do? I got into the computer, but the data was encrypted. Came up with this roster and what I think are some financial reports for the Northern California Committee. I think your people can probably do something with this. I hope so. Listen, Frank, we're gonna need you to wear a wire till we get a court order to bug Carvell's office. Forget about it. You got the disk. I'm done. I'm through. I'll call you. [music playing] [phone ringing] FITZPATRICK (ON MACHINE): Fitzpatrick. Leave a message. [beep] FRANK: Hey, Fitz, it's Jennings. Give me a call, will you? It's important. [music playing] Oh, my god. I'm dying. How 'bout a saucer of milk for my little sex kitten? Uh, how 'bout a double orange juice in the shower? Mmm, OK. [music playing] [gunshot] [music playing] Got a problem. Frank Jennings was in your office last night accessing information. - Are you sure? - Our FBI source confirmed it. Well, you'd better find out what he was looking for. What the hell happened here? You accessed some of our confidential files. I want you to tell me about it. Well, I didn't do it. You got it all wrong. Oh, no, no. No, see, you got it all wrong. Oh, goddamn it! [music playing] Come on, Frank. Look, there's nowhere to go. [elevator dinging] [music playing] Shut down the elevators. [music playing] [fire alarm ringing] [music playing] MATT (ON RADIO): Block all the lobby exits. [music playing] MAN: On my way down south stairwell, 14th floor. MATT (ON RADIO): Seal off the garage. [music playing] MAN: I'm on 13 and descending. I don't see him. MATT (ON RADIO): He must be going up. Get after him! [music playing] Security base, this is security one. Over. MAN: He's in the south stairwell going up. MATT (ON RADIO): Don't let him out of here. [music playing] MAN: Hold it right there, pal! [music playing] That's the guy! We got him cornered on the roof. [music playing] This is not good. It's not good. Oh, shit! [music playing] Aidan? We've got trouble. You're making a big mistake. What's going on? Why have you been arrested? Like two of our illustrious forefathers, Washington and Jefferson, I've been unjustly accused. But our constitution assures my imminent freedom. So please go back to work. We're gonna need every penny to pay for these lawyers. MAN (ON RADIO): You're on with City Talk. MAN (ON RADIO): The charges against Carvell are crazy. I wouldn't be surprised to find out the whole thing was a setup by the CIA. WOMAN (ON RADIO): The American people are behind Carvell. He fights for the working class-- MAN (ON RADIO): Carvell would run the country the way it should be run. WOMAN (ON RADIO): Polls say Carvell lost 10 points. I don't believe it. They tell us what they want us to here. MAN (ON RADIO): Maybe Frank Jennings is telling the truth. Maybe some of this stuff about Carvell is true. MAN (ON RADIO): Hey, hey. Frank Jennings is a weak man who's trying to make a name for himself by dragging a great man through the gutter. Frank Jennings belongs in jail. FRANK: You don't understand. This is not about a Senate race anymore. Fitz and Helene are dead. They're murdered. I have to testify! Frank, you have a son to think about. I know that I have a son to think about. I'm terrified. What's gonna happen when you testify? The FBI will protect us. Well, then why don't you let the FBI hang him? Aidan Carvell is not your responsibility! These people are dead because of me! This is my responsibility. Mr. Carvell, what will this do to your campaign? Will you go to jail? First of all, let me tell my people from free America that I am absolutely innocent of these ridiculous charges brought against me by our corrupt government. These are evil people trying to defame me. But I will not be silenced, and the truth will be heard. I will fight. And with your help, we all will win. [cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Excuse me. Tell me about Jennings. We sent him a message. [music playing] Trust me, the witness protection program works. I can't believe this is happening. This is turning into a goddamn nightmare. No, it's-- it's not gonna be that bad. You'll see. No, it'll be like our family no longer exists. Randy's gonna have no friends, no school. Come on, honey. It'll be OK. Excuse me. [music playing] What is it? [music playing] Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! Oh, god! [music playing] JUDGE: Will the foreman please read the grand jury's decision? The grand jury orders Aidan Carvell held to answer to the charges of conspiracy to commit murder and treason against the US government. Said defendant will stand trial in the US district court in Los Angeles, California. Well done, Frank. I think that idiot could have argued-- Carvell, I want to talk to you. --a little more forcefully. Stop! You're gonna look at me! I believed in you. Well, Frank, you don't have to stop believing. Free America's still the best thing for this country. It's a-- it's a funny thing. Even though you're no longer on my side, you're still working for me. All this publicity has pushed membership to an all-time high. There's no mountain high enough, Frank. Nothing will stop us. [music playing] FRANK: When are we going back to LA? Well, the trial starts next week, so we'll leave on Monday. Did you make arrangements for Annie and Randy? Yeah. I'll assign a couple of my guys to take care of 'em. I think they're gonna be safer here, Frank. Thanks, Thornton. You know, this whole witness protection thing's been a lot better since you've been involved. And we've kind of fallen apart a little bit, you know? I owe you one. - Oh, that's no problem. [horn honking] Looks like we're even. I think the motivation behind the government's action is pretty clear. By making me the bad guy, they take the attention off themselves and their incompetence. REPORTER: Indications are, however, that the government has a very solid case. They're-- they're wasting their time. A few people out there, enemies of this great country, can't stem the tide of change and advancement. Stop trying to hurt me. You cannot succeed. You will not succeed. Nobody, nothing can stop America's path to greatness. REPORTER: And that's all from here. Now back to you in the studio. You all right? Sorry to make you wait. But I just didn't want to miss a word that man says. He's just what this country needs. [music playing] RANDY: Here, Dad, catch! FRANK: All right. Come on. Good job. ANNIE: But why do I always have to be in the middle? FRANK: All right. Let's go. Come on. Get her. - No fair! - Throw it. - Catch! - All right. Good job. - Yeah. Hey, want the ball? Here. No! - Don't let Mom get it! Look what happened. Hey, come here. - Here. All right. Sure. Ready, hut! Oh. Nice miss. Good job, bud. Who taught you how to run, Jerry Lewis? Dad, can I get an ice cream? An ice cream? Yeah, I guess so. You want an ice cream? - Yeah, sure. - Dad, you want one? - No, thanks. Go ahead. [music playing] You know, I think we got some ice cream at home. Maybe we'll just have it there. - Dad. No, come on. Let's go. It's OK. But Dad, you said. What is it? Probably paranoia. [music playing] Let's go. [music playing] Come on. Back this way. [music playing] Hold it. You know, I think we lost 'em. RANDY: Who? I don't know. Come on, let's-- let's go. [music playing] Honey? Yeah, I see 'em. [music playing] They're gone. Maybe. You know, maybe they weren't even following us. Yeah, maybe not. Can we stop for ice cream? Sure. Maybe we should go to a hotel or something. FRANK: Oh, it was probably nothing. There's three messages. [beep] [dial tone] [beep] [dial tone] [beep] [dial tone] [beep] That's it. What are you doing? I'm calling Thornton. RANDY: You want chocolate sauce, Dad? Yeah, sure. Uh, Thornton, this is Jack Springer. I need to talk to you immediately. This is an emergency. Well, he's supposed to be there. Goddamn right he is. I'll page him. Maybe we should call the police. No, we just wait. Police are just gonna ask questions. [music playing] All right. I'll make something. [music playing] Dinner's almost ready. Why hasn't Thornton called back? I don't know. Frank. All right. Take Randy. Get in the bathroom. Lay down in the bathtub. Go on. Randy, come on. Come on with me, sweetie. Go, now. [music playing] You go around back. Yeah. [music playing] [knocking] [music playing] Medford police. This is Officer Halbert. Mr. Springer, we need to talk to you. Please open the door. [music playing] We need to talk to you, Mr. Springer. Please open the door. [music playing] [phone ringing] [music playing] Thornton. MAN: This is Officer Halbert. Were We're out on your front porch. We realize you have your family inside, and we understand your cautions. If you'd like to come out onto the front porch, you can check our IDs. Please, we only want to help you. [glass breaking] [music playing] FRANK: Don't move. [gunshot] [music playing] Get out of here! Leave my family alone! [music playing] OK, you all right? Come on. We got to go, now. OK, come on. Hurry. Behind me. Go. Out the back door. [music playing] Get to the car. Hurry! [music playing] [gunfire] [music playing] Let's go to the police. Those guys said they were the police. We just need to call Thornton. Yeah, Frank. I got your message. I went to your house right away. There were cops everywhere. What the hell's going on? Well, that's exactly what the question is. What the hell is going on? My family's in danger. THORNTON: OK, look, Frank, you've got to hang up. This-- this line could be tapped. Meet me at the emergency location, half an hour. All right? Be careful. OK. It's OK. Get down. All right, come on. I'll be back. You guys be quiet. You son of a bitch! [music playing] He's coming down the alley. Get him. [music playing] What happened? Stay down. [music playing] There he is. He just came out of the parking garage. [music playing] Shit. [music playing] Shit! RANDY: Dad! That was cool! Everybody OK? Yeah. Yeah. I think we're starting to overheat. I think it's had enough. Yeah, well, I can relate to that. Oh, I know it's not that funny. I just-- it's the only emotional I have left. Well? Said it's gonna take about, uh, four hours to fix it. Oh. Why don't we go find a hotel and get some sleep, huh? OK, good. Maybe I can get a hot bath. - Would you please? You need one. - Thank you so much. [music playing] [shower running] [music playing] RANDY: [crying] [music playing] Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. It's OK, little guy. We're OK. It's all right. Come here. Come on. It's OK. Come on. Quack. [music playing] Oh, come here. It's gonna be all right, son. Everything's gonna be OK, son. I'll protect us. I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you. OK, come on, now. That's it. Try to get some sleep. That's it. I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna be right here. Daddy? Yes. I love you. Love you, too. [music playing] Go to sleep. [music playing] He loves you. He loves you so much. [music playing] And so do I. [music playing] Yeah, Agent Green please. It's an emergency. Honey? What are you doing? Thornton's here. He saw the car. All right. He should have been here by now. Take Richards. Check the bus depot. Check all the car rental agencies. We're gonna check out the motels. Go, go, go, go. Go. All right. OK. We'll wait here. Just hurry. They're sending some agents over. How do we know we can trust 'em? We don't. I'll get Randy up. [music playing] Anne, hurry up. We've got to go. OK, you ready? All right, now. Go, go. - Let's go, Randy. Go, go. [music playing] Son of a bitch. Come on. Well, you said you wanted a bigger car. Let's go. Turn around! Let's go back and join the party. FRANK: All right Now, look, we're gonna do exactly what he says, OK? Get to the bus! Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. [engine starting] [bus driving away] Yeah, he paid with a credit card. Call Visa. Have 'em put a flag on the account. Go, go. You've been a good friend to Free America. Mmm, but, uh, who's gonna pay for the broken door? Well, you've got the account number. Use it. Put this on there, too. What do you got? They've stolen a bus, and they're headed down 128. A bus. Very creative. Are they following us? Not yet. OK, I got him. He's heading through the city. I spoke too soon. Here they come. [music playing] Hang on, Randy. [music playing] It looks like he's heading towards the freeway. [music playing] Go on, go on! Closer. Get closer! [music playing] I'm gonna need a little help. Come on. - Get down on the floor. Randy, get down. Get down. Get on the floor. Get on the floor, Randy. [music playing] THORNTON: Where the hell are you, boy scout? MAN: We just passed the Fairview exit. [music playing] Oh, my god. Frank? [music playing] Son of a-- [music playing] [inaudible] [music playing] Frank! Frank! Piece of shit! Annie! [music playing] Annie! Annie, Annie, Annie. Oh, good. Annie! My god. - Where's Randy? Where's Randy? - He's here. He's here. No, get him out! Get him out! Get him out! Get him out of here! Get him out of here! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, come on, Frank. It's been a long day. We're all tired. What do you say? Come on out! We'll talk about this like grown-ups, huh? [music playing] Oh, the little lady. [music playing] FRANK: Hold on, baby! I'm coming! Hold on! Frank, I'm stuck. I'm stuck, Frank. Go. Go. Get out. You get out. - No. You get out. No, we're out together. Leave me. Hold still, now. That's it. Come on. Come on! Hang on. Hang on! Come on! [music playing] Oh, no. [music playing] Come on, my little duck. Quack. [music playing] Hi. How's Randy? He's the same. [music playing] You know, he's lying there so peaceful, like he's asleep. I just keep waiting for him to wake up. He'll wake up. I know. I'm sorry, honey. I meant I feel like I could just reach out, and I could just shake him. And he'd wake up, and he'd start getting ready for school. He'll wake up. [music playing] I want you to know I, uh-- I told Agent Green I'm not gonna testify. What? I'm getting you and Randy out of here. That's-- that's all that matters. Carvell isn't even important anymore. I just-- And you think Carvell's just gonna leave us alone? When he knows I'm not gonna testify, yeah. He'll-- he'll leave us alone. This isn't about whether you testify or not. He's out to destroy you. He thinks that you betrayed him. He's at war. He takes your defection personally. He's not gonna back down now. What-- what are you saying? I'm saying you have to testify. It's out only hope. [music playing] All rise. The people call Mr. Frank Jennings. Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth in this matter pending before the court? I do. State your name. Frank Jennings. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Not guilty! You bet. You bet. Thank you for coming out. Thank you very much. Uh, Mr. Carvell. Mr. Carvell, it would seem that Frank Jennings's testimony today was a very damaging moment for you. The-- the government really scored big. Any comment on that? Frank Jennings is a pathetic man. - You think so? - Oh, yes. I fell for his false credibility. But I can assure you that the government's plot to defame me is coming apart at the seams. But more important than me are these people who come out to support me and their great country. Bless you. Bless you all. Bless you all. Keep the faith in a free America. So you think you have a chance, hey? Uh, this man has confidence that never stops, no matter what goes on. I mean, despite Judge Bamber's surprise ruling today not to allow the computer records into evidence on a technicality, it sure seems that the prosecution's case is stronger than ever. And a conviction seems very, very likely. All rise. Will the defendant please rise and face the bench? To the charge of conspiring to commit murder and to the charge of treason against the United States of America, the defendant is found not guilty. [cheering] No. Court is adjourned. Best defense money could buy. [music playing] What the hell happened? We just got decked. We had a lock on a conviction. Ah. Mr. Carvell. Mr. Carvell, you, uh-- you are obviously very pleased with this verdict. Does this mean you're going to continue your campaign for the Senate? Yes, I'm very pleased. And yes, yes, yes, I'm going to continue my campaign. I have felt the iron fist of out-of-control officials who think that once elected, they don't have to answer to the people. I say that's wrong. I say free America, then live in a free America. That sick bastard. I think I'm gonna puke. Thank you. Oh, Frank. Isn't it amazing? I mean how justice works? Who'd have thought? Frank, I'm sorry about your family. But hey, things will get worse. AGENT LUCKENBILL: The DA thinks the judge took a dive. How sure is he? Oh, he's sure. He's convinced Bamber is on Carvell's payroll. Damn it. I put everything on the line for you guys, and you come up with a crooked judge. Frank, everything remains the same. We have a deal. We'll take care of you. Yeah, what, like maybe, uh, another witness protection program? We're opening a new investigation, Frank. We're prepared to go the distance. Carvell will go to jail. Yeah. You know, you guys are so full of shit. You're right Carvell is crazed. He won't stop. I'm gonna sell all the stocks, clear the bank accounts, get our passports in order-- What? Just listen to me for a second. As soon as Randy's well, we're leaving. We're leaving the country. Oh, you can't do anything to that man. You know that, Frank. Tell me you know that. Anne, I'm just going to get our money. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I know you. You're up to something. - All right, look. I don't have time for this again. I'm meeting with the stock broker in 20 minutes. I love you. - Frank-- - I love you. Frank. I called about putting together some packages for me. Target? 12,000 square foot house. I'm gonna need 'em by 6:00 PM. Uh, sorry, partner. Uh, I can't hear you unless you're looking at me. I said I'm gonna need them by 6:00 PM. Cash on delivery. $10,000. OK. Hey, uh, where's the party? Maybe I could come along and help you out. Maybe next time, huh? Next time. [music playing] MAN: Here's the tape you requested of the Northern California Committee. As you can see, the money's been well spent. I'll be sending you tapes of the Minnesota and Alabama committees early next week. [music playing] They're looking good. Yeah. So talk to me. Our friend sold his stock and closed his bank accounts. He's getting ready to run. AIDAN: Do they know where he is now? MATT: No, but we'll find him. It won't take long. Watch his wife and kid. He's not going anywhere without them. [music playing] [camera shooting] [music playing] Questions? No, I-- I think I got it. Don't get cocky. These detonators are a delicate proposition. Very bad for the complexion. Drink? No, thanks. Hey, uh, I can help out. I'm a very good helper. I just love it when they go boom. [music playing] We got him. Hotel Dawn on Eighth. [music playing] Honey? I'm sorry I didn't call you earlier. Things got a little hectic. What's the matter? You sound funny? No, I'm fine. I just got something caught in my throat. I-- I think I'm coming down with a cold or something. I wish I could get out of this chair and make you some chicken soup. You should come see Randy. I think he's doing better. No, I-- I think I should stay in a hotel tonight. I don't want you and Randy catching what I have. But Frank-- Honey, listen-- I want you to know how much I love you. And I want you to tell Randy that I love him, too. Frank? Look, I'll, I'll, I'll-- I'll call you in the morning. I got to go. [music playing] Five all clear. Huh? [music playing] MAN (ON RADIO): Security base one, come in. Security base one. [music playing] Five's offline and late checking in. Check it out. Find him. Let me know what's happening. [music playing] MAN: Let's double-check that door. MAN: Right. [music playing] All secure. [music playing] Do you know what happened to the man? We're still checking. Check faster. Everything's covered. Don't worry. [music playing] We've got an intruder off the kitchen. Lock has been picked. Is it all right if I start worrying now? Find him. This is unit one, over. I want all units to check in immediately. [music playing] Check every nook and cranny. We don't know what he's up to. MAN: You, check the basement. Archer, you check the guest rooms. You come with me. [music playing] We've got a problem. There's a bomb in the hall closet. [music playing] How much time do we have? Three minutes and 12 seconds. I want a man stationed out front and a man in back in case he's still in here. What about the chopper? It's on the way. Let's go. [music playing] Goddamn it. My antiques, my house.
