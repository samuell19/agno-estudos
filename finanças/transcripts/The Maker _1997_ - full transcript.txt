When was this tomato slice on the tree? Plant. Whatever. I mean, when was this cream in the cow? JOSH: It's a non-dairy creamer. We just take things in without thinking about where it even comes from. We just consume. Get the check, huh, Bella? (SINGING) Whenever you want to. You can do what you want to. There's no one to stop you. You're sick. It's only jealously that makes you see these things. Jealousy? JOSH: Of our love, Bella. Thanks for coming on the show, sir, and be sure to stop by next time you're in town. You're just having a bad reaction to true emotion. BELLA: I mean, don't get me wrong. She's cute and everything. And I guess with the, you know, the gun and the cuffs, it's a bit of a power-trippy thing. But you never talk to her. Talk? Bella, our love is beyond words. Set me as a seal upon her heart for my love is as strong as death. Death Race 2000. It's from the Bible. The Bible? It's a book. No way. You mean it was a book before it was a movie?

Ambrose Pare, 1540. Fuck! What about flush toilets? - Sir John Harington, 1589. - God damn it! Down I thought I nailed the shitter question. You just cruise, don't you? It's a blessing and a curse. Are you gonna cruise through college, too? Three hots and a cot and all you have to do is read books and write papers? Doesn't sound so bad. Neither does ice water enemas if you just say the words and don't think about their meaning. (LAUGHING) Could it be the package, gentlemen? Our package has arrived. [rock music] [vocalizing] [tires squeal] Climb aboard the raft, Tuck, honey! [tires squeal] It's the postman! (CHEERING) What's that mean, anyway? The postman always rings twice.

You ready? Cryogenics. I can't afford a whole body. But I could foot the bill to have your heads frozen. You know, after you go beyond. They say all you need is the head, and they'll get you a new body later. What do you say? I'll take a wing, Josh. Would you come in here a minute? What's in here is for you, Josh. You were nearly two years old when your parents died. I must say, we have felt blessed to have you in our house these years. You are our son, Josh. I think you know that. It hasn't always been easy. You've had a tough time. I know it's still tough. I see the trouble in you, Josh. But I look beyond that, and I see a fine man. These are the adoption papers making you our son. Somewhere in there its says that we are responsible for you until you're 18. You are free. It's for you. What's this, Josh? It's from the college. Oh, that's-- that's wonderful, Josh.

I'm so happy. Yes. Oh, dear God. Josh, it's your brother. Happy birthday, Josh. I cannot believe he was adopted. Let alone, a brother. Yeah, well all this went down way before you moved in. Josh was only two when it happened. Walter was 12. Parents died in a car wreck. Fuck. He was in the car when it happened. And his brother was at a friend's place. No shit? Yeah, so the Minnell's adopted them both And 10 years ago, a day after his 18th birthday, Walter just split. Hey, Josh, man. You want some of this? How's it going, baby? Top of the world, ma. That good, huh? This [inaudible] powder is 100% guaranteed, man. Let's do it. Who's got the straw? Well, I don't have it. Nobody's got a straw? Wait a second. Anybody have a belt? We've got to have something. I've got s dime. That is not helping us here, Ike. Why don't you go look and see if you can find a piece of paper or something. Get down to business here. I've got something. Yo, Walter. Bella. You went to school with my brother, Eddie. Eddie Soto? Yeah. You're little Bella? Yeah. How's Eddie doing? He killed himself, man. Nah, I'm just fucking with ya. Do you want some of this? No, no, thanks. It's all for you. Eddie said you were a real partier. Eddie said that, did he? Yeah. Well, I guess I used to be a real partier. How'd you know we'd be down here? Your? Mom says you hang out here. My mom? My mom's dead, Josh. Come on. SIMON: Hey man, be careful with that stuff. Are you angry with me? I used to have parents. They died. I got new ones. I used to have a brother. Hey Josh, you still get that dream? I'm going to spend a couple of nights over at the Holiday Inn. [knocking on door] Come on in. Want a sandwich? I just came to give this back to you. Well, that's all right, Josh. Keep it. It's a birthday present. I don't want it. Well, why did you come up here, Josh? You could have left that at the front desk. You could have stuck it in the mail. What was it you wanted to see here, Josh? Why did you ask me about that dream? What difference does it make? You don't get it anymore, right? I'm out of here. [engine not turning over] You're flooding it. Fuck. Where are you going? I'm going to call a tow truck. Why don't you just let it sit there? We'll come back and jump start it later. Come on, college boy. Do the smart thing. Get in. Come on, I'll give you a lift home. We'll come back and jump start it later. I got to covered, Walter. You've got it covered? It is 1,000 degrees out here, Josh. You're going to have to pay some schmuck $75 to jump start your car, and you've got it covered? You have $75? Left that $100 up in my hotel room. [music playing] Harm from shock. Reaching around, put your hand to the clock. Should I [inaudible] No one, I mean no one, makes a better air conditioner than the hard-working men and women of the US of A, Josh. [inaudible] me? This isn't the way home. I know. I have to do a little business. Just take a few minutes, then I'll drop you off. Business? Yeah, you might find it interesting. I don't think so. I have to be somewhere. Where? You have to meet those friends of yours? They seem like a real supportive little crew. What the fuck would you know about support? Relax. I have to meet this guy, Josh. Look at some papers. It's only going to take a few minutes. Then I'll take you home. Two icy cold Cokes, extra sugary, mixed with all the freon in here. You'll be fine. You know, Josh. One day freon is going to be against the law. [music playing] (SINGING) Come to the parking lot. I was born the son of man who [inaudible] for the day.

OK, how about you? We're all right. I'll be seeing you. Hey, is this a hippie? Right? I thought we was done with hippie? Come on, fellas. Oh, this isn't hippie. This is that grunge look from Seattle. You from Seattle? No, I hail from Carthage. I'm traveling to Jerusalem to see the infant King I'm following the star. Look, it shines above us even now. Mint? Mint? Jesus, guys, you don't want to do this. Hold him. Let's just hold it right there. That's right. Let's all take it nice and easy. Detective Walter Schmeiss, County Sheriff's Department. What? Is it play time? Nobody told me. You say something? Why don't we take a walk over to me car and talk about this? Hey, detective, let's see a badge. This is police business now. You boys don't want to get involved. You don't badge us, you're no cop. I said this is police business. You don't want to get involved. You ain't no cop. If it will make you happy, I'll show you my badge. Run, Josh. Run. Yeah, you drive. County Sheriff's department? This is police business? You boys don't want to get involved. You boys? That name, Schmeiss, Detective Walter Schmeiss. Detective Schmeiss? What? Schmeiss is my name, Walter Schmeiss. After I left, I changed my name back. It was our parents' name, Josh. It was your name. Say it, what do you feel? Nothing. Yeah, you feel nothing. That's not what I meant, Walter. Hey Josh, you still get those bad dreams? Not anymore. You used to scare the shit out of me. Middle of the night, you moving around like you were awake, screaming like a fucking monkey. They're gone. I'm glad to hear that, Josh. Say Josh, you sleeping with that girl, Bella? Sleeping? Women are a big thing, Josh. You can't just go sticking your little toe in the water. That's a beautiful image, Walter. So tell me, what exactly is it that you do, Walter? It's a transfer and storage business. Look at him back from the dead. Hey, Walter. How you doing? It's good to see you, man. You must be Josh. Must be. Felice A Beato. He looks like you used to before you got old and fat. Gentlemen, come on in. Where's the old lady? Oh, she's out back. Walter, I got to show you something. Josh, I've got to talk to your brother for just a minute. So please, make yourself at home. (WHISPERING) This is what I was talking about. See this? he flies in, and then he'll meet us here. WALTER: You have one of these? FELICE A BEATO: Yeah, I got your back. Hey, come on. Hoof around with me a little bit, huh? He's going to be a little while. And meanwhile, we're just getting fatter. Grab the bag. Hold the bag for me. Come on, just hold on to the bag. Don't we need gloves or something? Why? So Walter told me that you had some trouble over at a rest stop, is that true? Just some assholes. Yeah? Come here. Jump into the ring with me. Come on, come on. Just move around a little to get the blood flowing. Yeah, I showed Walter a few things. Did he do all right? - Yeah, I guess so. Put your hands up. Guard up. Stand kind of sideways. Don't make yourself such a big target. There you go. That's how you do it. Thumbs in. Hey, pay attention. Come on, focus, focus. Let me ask you something. This rest stop, what did it look like? Birds, trees, and grass, I guess. You guess? First rule, environmental awareness, OK? You've got to be accountable for everything in, on, and around you. When I walk into a room I look around, OK? I notice the objects. Try to sit with my arm close to something small and heavy. Something happens, you go ballistic. You invade their space and make it your own. [grunting] Coffee cup. The bridge of the nose makes a hell of an impression. [inaudible] Ow, fuck. I always work out with a cup on. Yeah, I heard he was on the pipe. Crack. Yeah, but they busted his ass. Cop breaks down his door, right? Policeman runs in, and the policeman splits his pants. They caught it all on that show, Cops. Cops? On TV. All right, I'll meet you at the airport. Right, right. WALTER: Here they are right here. One's David and the other one is Steven. MOTHER: Oh, they're so precious. WALTER: You know, sometimes they're like a couple little animals. I don't know how I feel about being a grandfather. I have to be somewhere. Josh? You should bring them with you. [loud music] [inaudible] Diet root beer? Starting slow. I guess. You seen Bella? Hey, Josh, you want a hit? No thanks. Excuse me. Hey, Simon. Have you seen Bella? No. You all right? Yeah, man. I just think I need to sit down for a minute, you know? Simon, you are sitting down. Josh? Was it-- take brown acid earth. Don't take brown acid. Josh, I took the brown acid, man. What? Oh, shit. Oh my God, you didn't see me. You didn't see me. You didn't see me. Damn. Did you see that? That was a cheerleader, a cheerleader, man. It's taken me an entire week just to get her alone. Maybe you shouldn't use my car. But the hood was still warm. I mean, how was I to know you'd be in and out of there in under an hour? Give me some of that. [gags and spits] Disgusting. What is up with that? Diet root beer. Ugh. Everything ace in there, pal? It's just this Walter thing. It's kind of a fucking freak-out. Talk to me. The first five years he was gone, I missed him every day. Every morning, Bella, I would get up and check his bed and see if he was back. I just stopped. And now-- What's this? I'm sweating. Your eyes are sweating? Why'd he have to come back? Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Hey, take it easy, man. Fuck you. Hey, I have an idea. Do you want to hit the post office? No. I'm just going to sack out. Go find your cheerleader. I would, but she's probably off sucking some quarterback's cock right now trying to prove to herself that she's still normal. Good night, Bella. Goodnight, Josh. Goodnight of the Living Dead. Goodnight of the living Grateful Dead. Goodnight of the living Grateful Dead Kennedys. I've got to pee, got to pee, got to pee, got to pee. [police sirens] Got to pee. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. You know you ran a stop sign back there? Yes sir, ma'am. You doing OK there? You been drinking this evening? - No. Can I see your driver's license? You want to step out of the car for me, Josh? You want to hold out your hands, close your eyes for me? You want to go ahead and touch your nose with each hand. You can open your eyes now. I'd like you to walk that line for me. I'd like to but-- look, I have to pee badly. You have to what? I had five diet root beers, and I'm going to piss my pants if I don't pee. Look, I'm going to pee against the fence. And I'll come back and walk the line. I'm afraid I can't let you do that. I'm going to pee, and then I'll come back and walk the line on my hands. Look, I feel for you. I do. But if you go pee in those bushes, I'm going to have to arrest you for public urination. What? Public urination, I'm going to have to arrest you. Look, I'm going to pee. And then you can cuff me. Oh, thank you, God. Hello, Josh. After dinner they asked me if I wanted to spend the night. If you don't like it I'll leave. How come you told them you had a wife and kids? Well, makes my job easier if people think I'm just a normal guy with a suburban life. Transfer and storage? Transfer and storage, that's me. Did you get high tonight, Josh? Not that I'm against drugs, Josh. On the contrary, I'm all for them. I wish more people would use them. People who are using can be made to do anything you want. You know what I mean, Josh? Hey, do you remember these? The Bandito brothers, together forever. Together forever. Si, together forever. Sworn by the sacred blood oath. You remember the sacred blood oath, don't you, Josh? Fucking [inaudible], Walter. OK, here you go, dear. Fresh squeezed. Thank you very much. What are these appointments you have? WALTER: Well, you know, it's transfer and storage. Oh, Josh, Walter has some business meetings set up today, and he'd like you to go along. - What do you say, Josh? Would you like to go to work with your big brother? As long as you're both home in time for dinner. JOSH: You didn't tell me we were going out of town, Walter. WALTER: Well, we're taking the show on the road, Josh. With this job, you get to see the world. [music playing] (SINGING) Confession, [inaudible].. Absolution, everything is perfect here. Fuck it up and speak it. Yeah, [inaudible] So then I call the moving company from the switch box, and cancel the moving reservations. When the moving company calls back to confirm, I take the call. Tell them we changed our minds. Sorry to call and cancel, but we just love the house too much. We don't want to leave. It's simple. Basically we pull up, and they gave us everything they own. Most times you get lemonade. Sometimes you can get tip. Hey, guy. I got to go to work. My wife's still busy packing her precious [inaudible].. So if you break anything, you deal with her, OK? OK. It's a simple trick, Josh. You want to take it, or do you want to pass? Lemonade? I'll take it. Nice one, Walter. I'll take the brass duck bookends, Pat. [sobbing] Oh. Thank you. Will you finish this? Yeah. I have to find a Prozac that hasn't been packed away. WOMAN: Guys, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. This is just for moving me out. Understand that there will be more when you move me back in. How's it going in there, Bob? Fine. We get paid by the hour. Let's not take advantage. WOMAN: Don't break anything. [inaudible] A $10 tip, $10? Hey, she was well-intentioned. I think it was a nice gesture. Shit. No. What the fuck is going on? It's stuck? No, I think we hit something. We're stuck. Oh, man. The landing gear is dug it. Oh, damn. All this stolen shit and we're stuck? You think you can back it down? All right. No, the wheel is just spinning. I don't know about this grade. It's too steep. I don't trust the brakes. Turn it off. Yeah, turn it off. You got to give it some weight off the back end. Yeah, you're dug in all right. Yeah, trucks get stuck here all the time. You got a compound low in there? Yeah. I used to drive trucks full-time. If you don't think it'd be a problem with your insurance, I can give it a shot. I don't know, man. Hey, no problem. I mean, I'm just waiting on my ride to work. Well, what do you want to do? [police siren] Let's move that truck. Well, why don't you get off your ass and give us a hand? We've got precinct briefing in 15 minutes. Hey, this truck is just begging me to drive it out of here. One call, man. Get one of those jumbo wreckers out here. Drag this truck right up the hill. And what's the fun in that? Here. Get behind and watch for cars. It's all right, Chuck. Let him try. Take it easy. What the hell is he looking at, Walter? He's just looking. No, he's not just looking. He can see that I've been in, man. He's going to fuck with me. Take it easy. FELICE A BEATO: He's going to fuck with me, Walter. He's going to fuck with me. Take it easy. Shit. He's going to fuck with me Walter, he's going to fuck with me. Hey, before you pulled up, I saw that gun in his ankle. I thought it was a heist. But you're cops. My girlfriend's a cop. Always after me to get my hair cut. - How old are you? - Not as old as she is. [inaudible] Here? Over there. How you doing? What's new, pussycat? Nice desk. My guys brought it up so I'd be comfortable. [plane flying overhead] There used to be 500 homes out here. They tore them all down after they built that runway. You can still hear all the little kids playing hide and fucking go seek if you listen real close. [plane flying overhead] So why don't you just hijack the truck? Hijacking is interfering with interstate commerce. That's a federal offense, hard time. Most of this trick, we're just operating without a license, just a fine. I think I'm going to pass. But mostly hijacking involves guns. You'll never see Walter play the gun unless he's got his back against the wall. I'll take it. You want a bump? No thank you. I mean, you know, just to deal the deal kind of thing. All right. Somebody get me something. Somebody fucking get me something. This is silk. It's a fucking piece of silk. What's wrong with you? I didn't realize he was so far into the coke. As long as he keeps enough of that shit out of his nose to keep buying what we're selling. People who are using can be made to do anything. Yeah, that's what worries me. Next time I say we forgo the middle man and go straight to the source. I'm with you. Man, when that cop pulled up and locked that fucking look on me, I thought the trip was going south there for sure. Josh didn't. And because you were the maker, Josh, here's your bonus. I guess he was the maker. Maker? Any trick, any situation at all, somebody makes the rules. You always want to be the maker, Josh. You always want to have them play to you. [plane flying overhead] [sobbing] All right, I start. 44, 54, or 64, 79, 79. I cannot believe you. Old man's luck. That's what that is. Come on, let's do it again. Opening new territories? It's impossible. But you should have seen Josh. A natural. Give him a haircut and a suit-- whoo. This is fine for the summer. Come the fall, I don't want it interfering with your school plans. Root beer. Diet root beer. You better take it easy with those. Got a monkey on my back. I everybody's got their addictions. What's yours? I collect the caps from minor league baseball teams. Single, double, or triple A? Can I have another beer, and another shot, and another one of those. What do you make of this? Well, I can't make a positive ID. But it looks familiar. It' Japanese, very rare. Netsuke. Oh. I want you to have it. To thank you for the other night. I can't take this. Thank you. I can't. Three words, ready? Three words? Dance with me? Are you serious? [slow music playing] (SINGING) You've got a smile on your face and I can't seem to leave [inaudible].. I know [inaudible] and it's obvious you've been going out-- You were at the blood drive, weren't you? Mhm. (WHISPERING) You know, I'm too old for you. How old are you? 25. So when I'm 137, you'll be 144. You're very funny. Strange funny or haha funny? I'll get back to you on that. Run with me. Maybe you better slow down. We could go to Mexico, live under pseudonyms. I'll wear ultra dark sunglasses and you can wear a big hat. How big? We'll write trashy novels using only one name. No one will know if the author is a man or a woman. They'll be amazed how we get both sexes right. Strange funny, definitely strange funny. We'll go to the dog track. The locals there will know us. They'll protect us. From who? Those snooping reporters. Damn them. Except every once in a while, a grainy picture of us will appear in an obscure paper. Me and my big hat. Me and my ultra dark sunglasses. MAN OFFICER: Pat, yo, Pat. Come on, you on the team or what? I'm sorry, I have to do this. You're a funny kid. MAN OFFICER: Come on. All right. On your mark, get set, go. WALTER: Hey. Another trick? Are you doing anything else? I was going to go pick up a lazy karaoke machine. But I guess I can do that later. Are we meeting Felice there? Nope. This one's just you and me. What? What? - Rise and shine. We're here. Trick time? Grad that envelope, will you? So what's the trick? It wasn't right. What wasn't right? What they told us. We always knew it was a lie, didn't we, Josh? I don't think I like this trick, Walter. The car crash, Josh, it wasn't a car crash. Dad was in the life, Josh, all the way. It wasn't a car crash. That's just what they told us. It's all right. Let it come out, Josh. Let it come out. Dad took too much from the wrong man, Josh. One day you and Mom were in a car, and they brought you here. And when dear old daddy didn't give the man what he wanted-- husband and wife found slain in a deal gone bad. That's the word they used, Josh. Slain. You remember this place, don't you, Josh? That's Right. Let it in, Josh. [inaudible] Your brother said you were sick all night. Got food poisoning. It feels like death, huh? You left this at the bar yesterday. You should have told me you were Walter's brother. You know Walter? Yeah. He was a couple of years ahead of me in high school. I had such a crush on him. Long hair, always brooding, real bad boy. 10 years, he comes back a square John with a wife and a job. Who'd have thunk it, huh? So I got to go. You feel better. I'll take you out for a root beer. You can tell me all about Mexico. Mexico? Yeah, you and your ultra dark sunglasses. You and your big hat. Hi, Josh. Come with me, Josh. Come with you? Oh, the Bandito Brothers ride again. Mystery, intrigue, excitement. Let me think about it for a minute. WALTER: Fuck. Nobody knows, Josh. Nobody knows. You fuck. It's who you are. it's why you've always felt empty. Shut up. You're my only family, Josh. You're all I've got. Fuck, I need you. What are you going to do Josh? Huh? You going to go to college? Fuck you. You are lost, Josh. I know what that's like. But now you know. Go ahead, go to school. Live that life you're pretending. But you'll always be pretending. Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You want to live your life, or do you want to just pretend? Stop it. Oh my God. Where did you get these? Did you give these to him? I want you out of this house. I know what it's like, Josh. I want you out of this house, Walter. We're the same. I know you, Josh. It's in our blood. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me who I am? Because that's not who you are. You're not that. Then who the hell am I? Hey Josh. Where you been, man? Have you seen Bella? Fuck, man. You have been away. Parents sent her to a fucking rehab clinic, man. Where? They ain't telling. Said we're a bad influence. Her parents flipped out when they found out she was a carpet muncher. Hey, we were just going to go over to Wa Wa and pull a few [inaudible] off the whipped cream cans. Man, you want to come? Fucker. [conversation on tv] How come in these soaps, when someone dies at sea, they show them two years later with a parrot. You know in Texas, they can't hang a man with a beer. They have to use a rope. Anyone around now? It's 3:15 in the afternoon. WALTER: Worst case scenario, it goes wrong. [knocking at door] How about security on this level? [knocking continues] Well, Josh, I didn't expect to see you here. So when's the next trick? Felice and I just getting ready to plan one. You could take it, or you can pass. I'll take it. It's OK, Josh. This is my friend, Rubicon Beziqui. Good to know you, Josh. Always be the maker, huh, Walter? What can I say? I wasn't getting in. You're a tough guy to convince, Josh. We going to do this or what? Did you delay the ambulance? Got us 15 minutes. Better be cool with the clock. Here's your paperwork. Make sure they sign, give them the receipt, you're good to go. So what's the trick? He wants to know what the trick is. You can't learn anything, Josh, if somebody answers all the questions for you. Think. We're in a hospital. Can you inject it? No. Can you swallow it? You mean like pills? Yeah, like pills. No. Walter. Josh. OK, we're on the roof. You want to tell us what they're thinking down there. RUBICON BEZIQUI: They're thinking you just landed, boss. OK, so what's the trick? The trick is to move fast and short, but not reckless. Come one, let's go. Let's do it. It's all set to go, nurse. You're ambulance? Up, up, and away. Take that. Here, here, and here. What a world, huh? Hey, baby, goodnight. Night. Walter? Ah, mi corazon. A heart? We're stealing a human heart? What about the person who needs this? The person who's buying it needs it too, Josh. Don't ever stop playing the middle of a trick. Hey, I need some help over here. This guy is stroking out. I need some help over here. Josh, take this to the ambulance. MAN: I need some help over here. I'll be right back. Let's roll. Where's your little bro? He's not here? Isn't this the part where we all get in and leave? Josh, about what happened up there, trying to stop play like that. If you try to renege in the middle of a trick, somebody is going to take all your points. Tell me where you were, Walter. What? I want to know what you had for breakfast. I want to know what you wore, what it looked like. What's he saying, Walter? I don't know. What are you saying, Josh? I want to know where you were when you left me at home. I want to know who you saw, what they said. It's just that I have no picture Walter, in my hand. All those years of yours are just blank. Did you listen to music? Did you read books? Did you have a dog? Josh. Did you have a dog, Walter? Hey, yo, we're there. Let's go. Grab that box. You're gonna deal with [inaudible]?? No, we'll do this ourselves. We got us a mean old man out of Tejas with a bum ticker and a bundle of cash. [inaudible] out a plane here in 47 minutes. So let's move it, gentlemen. WALTER: Let's go. Start my car. This will only take a second. [gunshots] Fucking [inaudible]. Fuck. Josh? [felice yelling] [inaudible] Josh. [engine revs] Walter! Walter. Walter. WALTER: Stop the car, stop the car. JOSH: What, Walter? Fuck it man, put it in reverse. Walter. Not only were you going to steal from me. Not only were you going to shoot me in the back. But you were going to humiliate me in front of my own brother. I fucked up. Yeah. [inaudible] fucked! But I'm the fence, man. You're supposed to go through me. I got debts I got to get clear. JOSH: Walter. Are you clear? [inaudible] Hey, hey, hey, Felice, man, I got no guns. What the fuck? My guns are empty. Hey, man, I'm the fucking fence, all right? God damn you. Walter. Walter. Walter? God damn it. Walter, you're shot. Scarney? You got to get him. Your shot, Walter. We're going to the fucking hospital. You got to go out there and get Scarney, or we're both fucking dead. I can't do this Walter. He made us murderers, Josh. Now it's us or him. He understands that, OK? Here, take it. Go on. You can do this, Josh. Go on. [groaning] You don't want to do this to me. Don't do this to me and Mrs. Jones. I got a lot of cash. Everything you ever wanted. Anything I ever wanted, dead or alive. Yeah. Here. That's $100,000. Just take it and I'm gone. Gone with the wind. How old are you, anyway? Shut up. You know, I have son. He's about your age. Shut up. You want me to tell you what his name is? Come on, kid. Fuck. [gunshots] You get him? Atta boy. Where are you going? I'm taking you to the hospital. No, you took this trick, Josh. You said you were in. Turn left up here. Turn left. You believe this shit? Lucky fucking shot. Well, even a blind chicken gets a piece of corn every once in awhile, huh? Fuck. Felice, Walter. And Rubicon. They're out. Felice is out. Rubicon is out. And Scarney's out. We're still in. [sirens] It's OK. They don't see us, Josh. We're square Joe's in an American car. We're on our way home. From work. We work together. Family business. That's right. We're brothers. We just finished this trick, then we counted the points. And it's over. It's over now. No, it's not over. It's over now. I left the heart at the hospital when you were dealing with the doctor. You left the heart at the hospital? I couldn't take it. You couldn't take a simple trick. I couldn't take someone's life. Christ. Everybody wants to do tricks, Josh. Every greedy little suck wants the big tricks. Most times you take the trick, you win. But to take the trick and lose, they get all your points. I was right about you. You're the maker, Josh. Walter? Walter? Walter? No. [horn honking] [upbeat music playing] Come on, Walter. Come on. It's over now. It's all right. SCARNEY: Hey, kid. I know you're in there. I can't let you keep that cash. Look, you don't even have to see me. Just slide it on out. Hey, I gave you that money. It was a moment of weakness. But you shouldn't have taken advantage of it. Talk to me. We really don't have to have these kind of problems. Hey, kid. How am I going to take this trick, Walter? SCARNEY: Hey, kid. How am I going to be the maker, Walter? SCARNEY: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Good God almighty. Fucking brothers. Suck on this, Walter. I think I'm clear now, Walter. Yeah, fucking brothers. [sirens] He's unarmed. Josh? They shot each other, huh? Come on, Josh, You ready? [music playing] Momma gripped onto the milkman's hands. And then she finally gave birth. Years go by, still I don't know who shall inherit this earth. And no one will know my name until it's on a stone. This could be your lucky day in hell. Never know who it might be at your doorbell. This could be your lucky day in hell, in hell, in hell. You're riding like a queen in her golden carriage. Drawn by a team of hand-picked [inaudible].. You're the kind of [inaudible] conversation that I can't forget, forget, forget. I believe in the innocence, yeah. I believe in the innocence. I believe in the innocence. Yeah, I believe in consequence. [inaudible] you look like a child, you look like a thief. I believe in her, I believe in [inaudible].. I believe in the innocence. Yeah, I believe in the innocence. I believe in the innocence. Yeah, I believe [inaudible]. I believe in the innocence. I believe in the innocence, yeah, I believe. I believe in the innocence, yeah. I believe in the innocence.
