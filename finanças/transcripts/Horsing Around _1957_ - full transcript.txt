Oh, isn't that awful? So what? We got troubles of our own. Yeah, our sister, Bertie, refuses to eat, and you're worried about Schnapps. You're right. But Bertie is unhappy here. After all, this is a tough place for her to bring up her baby. Ah, she's just stubborn. She's not. It's just hard for her to readjust herself. Remember, she's not like us. She died and was reincarnated. Reincarnated or not, she's still our little sister, and we've gotta to do everything possible to make her happy. Well, let's go in and talk to her. Right. [BOING] Ow! Ooh, you backbiter, that hurts. Shut up! Not so loud. Not in the head. You know it's soft. Oh. Make bigger circles. Oh. Come on. BERTIE: ♪ Rock and roll, my baby ♪ ♪ Sleep I don't mean maybe ♪ ♪ You will grow Real big of course ♪ ♪ And be a great big Circus horse ♪ ♪ La, la, la La, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la La, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la La, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la La, la, la ♪ Look, Bertie, you gotta eat something, sis. You're very kind brother dear, but I can't eat. I've been living here for a week when I should be out trying to find my mate. You know every child needs his father. Well come and eat something first, then after lunch, we'll figure out a way to find the kid's pappy. All right, Bertie, now come on, come on. We gotta eat something, come on. Thanks a lot. Come on. Have potatoes? Mm. Ah, Bertie. You're glad you came in here now, huh? And how. Ha. How's the salad? Mm, I love this horseradish dressing. BERTIE: Mm, it's delicious. Hey, what's the idea of spreading mashed potatoes on your bread? Why don't you use butter? That's fattening. Oh. [GRUNTS] Ooh, that hurts. I'm sorry, Joe. "I'm sorry, Joe. I'm sorry, Joe." Can't you ever say anything like "I'm glad" for once? Yeah, so I'm glad I'm sorry once. That's better. Here, Bertie, have a drumstick. Thanks. Mm, it's delicious. Boy, you must like them. How about another one? Uh-huh. Mm. Here's your iced tea. Thanks. Larry, here's your iced tea. And Bertie, here is yours. BERTIE: Mm, thank you. Yummy, yummy. Say, fellas, when are we gonna find my mate? Soon as we finish eating. Say, incidentally, where would we find him and what's his name? Everybody knows my mate. He's the famous circus horse, Schnapps. Schnapps, he's your mate? Yup, that's him. My baby's a blue blood. Oy. Moe, what will we do? Shh. [COLT NEIGHING] [NEIGHING] Oh, my baby is hungry. I better take care of him. [COLT NEIGHING] Coming, darling. [COLT NEIGHING] Mother's coming. Hey, fellas, we mustn't let Bertie know about Schnapps. Right, and we gotta get to that circus before they destroy him. Joe, get rid of the dishes. Right. Boy, we're in an awful mess and don't know how we're gonna get out of it. LARRY: There's gotta be a way. Now, that circus is at the fairgrounds at Winkelberg and that's a long way from here, and we don't even own a car. Hey, why don't we rent a wagon? After all, our sister is a horse. Boy, that's really horse sense. [CHUCKLES] But we can't take the baby with us, so we'll have to get a babysitter. Where are you going to get a babysitter? There's a horse at Santa Anita owes me a $5 favor, so I'll get her to sit with the colt. [LAUGHS] Now we're really getting some place. I think Bertie will go for that. Yeah. Let's go tell her. [DISHES CRASHING] MAN: Oh! Hey! What the Sam Hill you doing up there? What's the idea of throwing the dishes out the window? You told me to get rid of them, so I did. So you did. Heh-heh-heh. Oof!
