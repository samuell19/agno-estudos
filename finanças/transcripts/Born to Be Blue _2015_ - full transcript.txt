(DOOR OPENS) (JAZZ MUSIC) (WOMEN SCREAM) Chet Baker. Come on. Give us a smile. - (EXCITED CHATTER) - Are you coming to the show? Who do you like better, me or Miles Davis? MC: We're proud to present the man voted number one in the nation for both trumpet and vocals. All the way from the sunny shores of California. The James Dean of jazz, the Prince of Cool. The man Time magazine credits with inventing West Coast swing. (APPLAUSE) That's right, folks. And he's here playing a double bill with our very own Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie! (APPLAUSE) Making his Birdland debut, Chet Baker and his quartet! (CHEERING) It's going to be great. It's going to be great. - How do I look? - Perfect. (CHEERING CONTINUES) (PIANO BEGINS) (WOMEN SHOUT AND WHOOP) (CHEERING) Yeah, baby! Yeah! Thank you. - Thank you very much. - WOMAN: We love you, Chet! (BAND PLAYS AT A FAST TEMPO) (INDISTINCT VOICES) Shh! Elaine? Honey? (LAUGHS) Yeah! And then you wait till it melts. I can't believe you never tried it before. - You're so square. - I hate needles. - Will you do it for me? - Yeah. - Hello, fear. - Hello, fear. Tight... - Hello, death. - Hello, death. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. Oh, hey, babe. - Hey... You better... - ELAINE: Get out. Get out! And take your shit with you! And you, too! I should have known! - Stop it! - Just come here... - Goddamn it! It's, like, a week! - CHET: I'm sorry. - You're such a child. - But you love me, hm? What is this shit? What is this shit? You did this because of Miles? Chet? Say something! Shh... See? Once you're here, it's like you're crawling back inside your momma's womb. Hm? The clinking and clanging... it all melts away. And you can hear. This is the scene where you're meant to do heroin for the first time. - I know what scene it is. - You made up lines. Well, he told me to make up lines. He said he wanted it to be improv. - But that's way off script, come on. - Well, the whole thing is fake. If you want it to be real, - there should be puke everywhere. - MAN: Cut! It wasn't like this at all. I was 22, for fuck's sake. That was way, way off script, Chet. - I dunno what the fuck I'm doing. - Know your lines! Can we just do the make-out part again? I lost a nail. (BELL RINGS) Do you want to rehearse the scene or do you want to pick up on Monday? - We'll pick it up Monday. - Alright, folks, that's a wrap. - See you next week. - Unprofessional, Chet. - Jane? Jane, that was great. - I don't think so. - Keep doing what you're doing. - You sure? Yeah, just keep improvising, you'll be OK. Alright. Appreciate it. Thanks, Ellie. MAN: What I'm doing is trying to make him look like a nice guy. No, no, what you're doing is making me look like a clown! - Oh, are you Dick Bock? - Yes. Yeah, I... - Chettie! - Hey, Dick. Why didn't you tell me you were back in the US? - And now you're shooting a movie? - Well, I... I thought you had another couple of years in jail. Well, I was supposed to, you know, but then this director, he's like... He's super talented. Oh, yeah, and he offered you a lot of money? Well, he paid somebody, that's for sure. I could've played myself, Chet. Dick, you're not... you're not an actor. - DICK: Neither are you. - Well, that's true! (CHUCKLES) Don't tell anyone! A lot's, uh... - A lot's changed since you left. - Yeah. I see. DICK: Jazz is dying. Dylan went electric. You sold Pacific, Dick. No, I built it up. You tore it down. I built it up. - CHET: We built it up. - You tore it down. CHET: And you sold it out. I sold...? At least I didn't abandon my wife and kid and become the world's biggest junkie. I did fuck everything up, didn't I? I miss you, Dick. I really do. - Chet! - DICK: I just wish you would've called. Two seconds, OK? I should've called. I'm sorry. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) You remember that old pharmacist that used to give us prescriptions for those morphines? Yeah. Oh, you liked him! I have to be high before I get my finger outta my ass! - Chet! - Yeah, two seconds. - What happened to him? - He's in jail. Aren't you on... Aren't you on the straight and narrow? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Clean as a hound's tooth. - Great. Alright. Let's get together. Alright? Let's talk about doing another record. - I would like that very much, Dick. - We're grown-ups now. - Let's do another record. - Let's do it. That'd be great. Alright. Hey, Nick, is everything OK? It's going great. It's gonna be great. Look, tomorrow, the studio booked another press conference. - Another press...? - The afternoon, one o'clock. - WOMAN: Hi, Chet. - One o'clock? OK. How's it going with you and Jane? Everything OK? I don't know. I mean, you tell me. I think it's great. I can trust what you're doing, like when you play music. This movie will re-launch your career, Chettie - Jane! - Hey, Nick. What's wrong? I don't know. I mean, do you think it's working? I think it's great. What the two of you are doing... The improvisation is fantastic. I need to know more than just that I'm playing "the women of Chet Baker". And you're doing it brilliantly. Ask him, it's his story. All I know is that they have big tits. - Like... It's not a lot to go on! - Well, it's his story. Ask him. - MAN: Nick, you coming? - They did have big tits. Hang on a second. We'll talk about this Monday, OK? - OK. Sounds good. - Alright. Big scenes. Europe next week. Ciao. Don't be insecure about your tits. Your tits are great. OK, so, the script... Uh... I don't understand why these women would stay with you. - You don't understand that? - No. Don't get it. Maybe we should go to dinner, get some real food... What, you saying that I ain't real, mister? I'm saying that maybe you need to get deeper into character. I don't date actors I'm working with, Chet. I already told you that. - Yeah, but I'm not an actor. - Yeah, that's for sure! No, we can get together and do those kazoon exercises some time. It's kaizen, you dummy! I don't care. We'll just rehearse while we eat, you know. We could order in if we want. You know everything about me, and I don't even know your last name. - It's on the call sheet every day. - It is? - Hm-hm. - Can l...? I don't like this thing. - What? I've got food on my face? - Beauty mark. You're prettier without it. Come on, let's go out. Have some laughs. - You don't strike me as funny. - I'm funny. What's heavier, a full moon or a half moon? A full moon, because it's lighter! Not so good. - It's not funny? - No. - I have better material. Top shelf. - Azuka. - What's that mean? - That's my last name. It's African, and it means "past glory." Now, see... You're not following through. - Just show me. - Alright, alright, alright... Just lay it out there. Well, that's another goose egg for you. Come on! You are really competitive. I guess they didn't teach you about bowling back there at acting school? Very funny! I was supposed to be an academic, actually, like my parents. - And my brothers. - But then what happened? Oh, I fell in love with musicals on Broadway. I studied jazz. - CHET: Did you? What instrument? - Piano. Voice. I've never been with a woman who knew anything at all about music. - So, what did Elaine like to do? - Elaine? Mostly she liked to fuck. She liked to fuck, and I liked fucking her. What? What? I don't know. Your songs are so romantic. But I guess you never wrote them, right? Uh-uh. One time we did it seven times in two hours. What do you think about that? Sounds like you fuck too fast. Oh! I do better when I'm high. So you're really a junkie? I got some habits. So, what, your parents didn't love you enough or something? CHET: No. It's nobody's fault. So why are you such a fuck-up, then? Huh? CHET: You want to know? Do you want to know the truth? Yeah, I want to know the truth. It makes me happy. I love to get high. Well, at least you're honest. What about you, huh? Why are you such a fuck-up? - I'm not a fuck-up. - Oh, yeah, you are. Yeah, you're an actress, aren't you? - All actresses are fuck-ups? - Yeah, well... What is it they say about Hollywood? They'll pay you two grand for a kiss and two bucks for your soul. - You know who said that? - No. Marilyn Monroe. Closing time, folks. We sing, you know that song... # I've never been in love before # Now all at once, it's you... You know that, right? # It's you, forevermore # I've never been in love before it I thought my heart # Was safe # I thought I... Why don't you come back with me to my place so we can sing? That's not a good idea. - Listen, I know all about you. - What do you know? I know you're trouble. Trouble's good for you. That's why your playing touches people. It's like what Chekhov said. When his patients were in a fever, you know what kind of food they liked to eat? Something sour. And my dad read me all the philosophers before I was a teenager, but Chekhov...? He thought that the feelings that we experience when we're in love are our normal state. That being in love shows a person who he should really be. I love... Remember me, Chettie? MAN: Fuck him up! JANE: Oh, Chet! Chet! Did you forget what you owe us, Chet? Fucking junkie! - Come here! - JANE: Stop it! Help! Stop! No more jazz, motherfucker! (MAN LAUGHS) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Help! Help! (TRUMPET PLAYS) MAN: He's got severe trauma to the neck, possible fracture of the cheek. He's lost all his front teeth. Chet? It's Jane. You look like shit. You're going to be OK. MAN: You know what an embouchure is? It's like a piano player not having any hands. Twenty-eight years of practice, gone! He'll never play again. RADIO: From Hollywood, in a dramatic U-turn, the studio is now shelving the Chet Baker movie which was meant to launch the recently paroled jazz legend's comeback. JANE: They haven't called me. They can't shelve the movie that quickly. DICK: That was no stranger. That was Chet's dealer. Do you think the studio's gonna have anything to do with this? Just wake up. OK, wait... Somebody must be able to help. I mean, somehow. Yeah, how many people have called? How many people have come to visit? We're all here. This is everybody. And I'm leaving. I looked after you for 13 years, Chet. Alright? But I'm done. I'm done. JANE: This is such a mess. How long have you known him? Five weeks. OK. Get clean, Chet. (GROANS) MAN: I spoke to your parole officer who says you'll be starting methadone treatment, so, unfortunately, I can't prescribe any pain medication. Just hang in there. And avoid any stress to your mouth, OK? (TENTATIVE, UNSTEADY SOUND) (WAVERING PITCH) (INTERMITTENT SOUND) (PLAYS POORLY) (PITCH CONTROL IMPROVES) (TRIES HIGHER NOTES) (APPLAUSE I WHISTLING) (APPLAUSE) - How'd we do? - Brilliant, Chettie. - Sensational! Amazing! - Where's Elaine? Ah, Elaine, did you hear that? Huh? Come on, Miles asked to see you. Come on, come on! Chettie, Miles! Chet just wanted to say hi before your set, Miles. This is Elaine. How are you doing? Hi. - You dig the show? - MILES: It was nice. Yeah. A lot of pretty faces. It was, um... sweet. Like candy. Must be real hard posing for all these pretty pictures. I'm just trying to sell records, right? Right. Let me tell you something. I never trust a cat who'd let loot or love affect his art. You think them silly white girls out there understand a lick about yo ass? DICK: He's number one in the polls, Miles. (CHUCKLES) Is this your great white hope, sweetheart? Standing right here? Is this it? You want some advice, Baker? Go back home to the beach, man. This ain't the place for you. Come back when you've lived a little. - WOMAN: Hello, fear. - CHET: Hello, fear. - WOMAN: Hello, death. - CHET: Hello, death. WOMAN: Fuck you. CHET: Fuck you. (RATTLE OF COINS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) (DOOR OPENS) JANE: Hey, Chet. You home? You left the door open. I didn't get the job, so don't ask. What did you do? What did you do? Wake up! Wake up! Come on, Chet. (DIALS TELEPHONE) Come on, come on. - Why did you wake me up? - (HANGS UP PHONE) (SHE BREATH ES HEAVILY) (CHET MOANS) You're going to kill yourself because you can't play trumpet any more? Yes. Am I supposed to feel sorry for you? Play something else. Sing. Maybe we haven't been introduced. My name's Chet Baker. I'm one of the greatest trumpet players of my generation. One of the best jazz improvisationalists. - So it's trumpet or nothing? - Yes. So maybe I should kill myself, too, because I don't look like Vivien Leigh. You should find one thing and be better at it - than anybody else in the world. - That's easy for you to say. "I'm blessed with a rare gift." Have some humility. - You're missing the point. - It's love. Ever been in love, Chet? - I've been married. Twice. - Yeah, I played those women. I didn't feel real love. You wanna feel real love? You ought to. One time. No, I don't want to get high with you, Chet. I was just kidding. How did you get into it anyway? When I was released from the army, a little while later, I came home one day and there was a note on my door saying auditions with Charlie Parker at the Tiffany Club, 3pm. Right, so I grabbed my horn and I run over there. I could see 30 or 40 trumpet players, all sitting there. Every trumpet player in LA was there. And there he was, big as a house. When he was somebody, right? And then after a while, he says... "ls Chet Baker here?" Somebody must've told him about me. And I said, "Yeah. Yeah, Bird. I'm here." And so I came up and we played two tunes. We played Cheryl, and The Song Is You. He took the microphone, he said, "Thanks for coming, everybody. This audition is over." - He gave you the job just like that? - Just like that. He said I was "Bixellated." (CHUCKLES) He was a big fat junkie by then, right? Don't talk shit about Bird. It was an honor to score for him. - Some role model. - Yeah, he was. He was. He never hurt anybody but himself. Just like me. If anyone's gonna hurt you, it's gonna be me. No. No, no... (GENTLE JAZZ ON RADIO) I don't date zombies, Chet. You want me to stick around, you have to promise me you'll stay clean. - On the methadone. - I love methadone. - Methadone is amazing. - I'm serious. I am, too. I mean methadone... No, I see you scratching your face like that again, then I'll know you're not clean. I'm clean. Listen to me. I had my teeth done, just for you. (CHUCKLES) JANE: I miss your missing tooth. - Yeah? - Hmm. How did you lose it anyway? CHET: Oh, come on, you read the script, right? I was 12 years old. I threw the rock off the side, and it ricocheted and broke my tooth. You're your own worst enemy. Hm-hmm. Well, you need to better prepare for your roles, ma'am. No, I couldn't play for more than a year. I had to hole up inside that stupid barn and practice every day. Yeah, but you managed, right? Yeah, but that was one tooth. I mean, what are you saying? You think I should go back down there? Well, you need to recover, Chet. Not just your jaw. But I love this apartment. You're losing this at the end of the month. Oh. That's true. Would you come with me? Hm? I'm not dropping my life for you. (CHICKENS CLUCK) WOMAN: What... What a surprise, Chettie! - Hi, Momma. - Give me a hug! Aw... - Give me back my hat. - Oh, you need a haircut, boy! And that jacket... You're going to freeze to death. How are your teeth? Are they healing? Let me see. CHET: This is Jane. Ah. You look like Chettie's ex-wife. - Mom, I told you... - Well, I played Elaine in the movie. - Yeah. - Nice to meet you, Mrs Baker. I never did like her. CHET: We were thinking about visiting a little bit, if that's OK. Yeah, that would be wonderful. You can stay as long as you want. Stay until after Christmas. Hiya, Dad. Hey, Junior. - MOTHER: He's going to stay with us. - Yeah. I can hear, Vera. You trying to dry out again? That's a lovely farmhouse that you have, Mr Baker. FATHER: Thank you. You know, you look like a nice colored girl. If I was you, I'd get in that car and... I'll get my stuff. Uh, you can have your old room, alright? FATHER: Hey, Chesney! Filling station up the road's hiring! Must've been lonely out here. No brothers or sisters. I had my trumpet. And the radio. That's all you need now. - And some time. - And you. Right? (PRACTICES TUNE) VERA: Don't stop, honey. It sounds good. CHET: I got no chops, Mom. It's real progress. It is! FATHER: Yeah. Time to hang it up, son. MAN ON PHONE". Mr Baker, my name is Officer Reid. I'm taking over as your parole officer. You should've received a letter to that effect. I understand you've agreed to try this new treatment called methadone. CHET: Oh, yeah, Officer. I just love it. Just as addictive as heroin, without the high. Hey, it's legal, and it's keeping you clean. CHET". There is that. REID: You've got to find a steady job and be patient, Mr Baker. I'll see you when you get back to LA. That's me. Mr Patient. (LINE GOES DEAD) (WHISPERS) Hey, Miles. Hey, Dizzy. There's a little white cat on the West Coast gonna eat you up. ELAINE: Forget about Birdland. (PLAYS WITH MORE SECURE PITCH) I think I need to get better glue for these bastards. Checkmate! I need to see this... nonsense. - Checkmate? - Victory is mine. - I let you win. - You're such a sore loser. You better settle my prize. Yeah, you'll get your prize. JANE: Horn's not the only thing that tongue's good for. Have you been with other trumpet players? Trombone, alto sax... Yeah. Just not trumpet. Never trumpet. Shh! My mother! Shh! - (GRUNTS) - Chet, easy! Easy, Chet. Just slow down, slow down, OK? Pretend you're playing me. Just relax, OK? Just breathe. Just breathe. Alright. That's better. That's better. Hope you can hold that note all night. - Chettie? Why don't you stay longer? - I wish we could, Ma. No, he got to run back to the big city. He's gonna to stay clean this time. (WHISPERS) Do it. Hey, Dad. I got this for you. I know it's your favorite. You remember you used to play it for me on the banjo? It's got that tune we loved, Born to Be Blue. - Oh, my goodness! - Yeah, right? That's a pretty tune. - Thank you. - Alright. I based my recording off the way you used to play it. FATHER: Hm. But... why'd you have to sing it like a girl? Well, I sold a lot of that record. How many records did you sell? Oh, that's right. You quit, right? L didn't quit. Yeah. But I never embarrassed my family. I never dragged the Baker name through the mud. Goodbye, Dad. (JAZZ ON RADIO) JANE: You alright, Chet? CHET: Would it be OK, if, uh, you know, I moved in with you? (PLAYS TRUMPET) JANE: Chet, I'm trying to sleep! WAITRESS: Are you pizza 14, Henry? MAN: That's us, thank you. (WOMEN SCREAM) (MUSIC FINISHES I LIGHT APPLAUSE) (CHATTER I LAUGHTER) (PLAYS WELL) (CHATTER I LAUGHTER) (SLIDES OFF NOTE) (CHATTER CONTINUES) - Nice. - OK. Hey, thanks a lot. You guys are here every Sunday? Yeah. You might want to practice more on your own, first. You know that's Chet Baker, right? MAN: That's Chet Baker? Holy fuck, that's Chet Baker. Nice fucking going. (REHEARSES TUNE) MAN: Whenever you're ready, Miss Azuka. Heaven gave us friendship that we may open our hearts and escape the secrets that weigh upon us. I can try it a different way. I've got a lot of ideas. MAN: No, I think, uh... I don't think it's gonna work out. (KNOCKS AT DOOR) (DOG BARKS) Yes? - Hey, yeah, is... ls Dick around? - I'll see. You'll never guess who's at the door. - Chet? - Hey, Dick. Am I getting you at a bad time? You meditating or something? - You should try some. - No, it's just corny man. - I heard you were clean. - I am. I'm clean. Ever since the accident. Accident? How much do you need? Dick... I just need a session, man. I heard you were playing some pizza parlor. Yeah, yeah... I didn't think that that would be... possible. You know, it hurts a little bit. But, uh, you know... I'm blowing pretty... pretty well, Dick. Pretty well. Good enough for a solo record, you know, like old times. Not gonna happen, Chet. CHET: I got a probation officer breathing down my neck. If I fall this time, I'm going to do some real time, you know. - Jane's pregnant. I mean I'm... - You and Jane are together? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No. I can't help you this time, uh... Dick, you haven't even heard me play. Good to see you, Chet. Take care. (SIGHS) DICK: Chet! Give me the plant. Give me the plant. Jane really pregnant? That's a start. I'm sorry, Chet, it's not like the old days. Stay clean. (WAVES CRASH) (APPLAUSE I WHOOPING) - Did you like that? - Yeah, man, it was really good. Would you sign this for me? Oh, yeah, sure. - I'll get you a beer, OK? - Yeah. Yeah, great. - What's your name? - Sarah. - Sarah? - Sarah with an "h." Yeah, OK. And what's this here? That's just, um... a little gift to help you relax up there. - And you look like such a good girl. - I am a good girl. - Are you with her? - Uh... - Yeah, you know... - Yeah. You should call me if you ever want to explore other instruments. OK. Well, thank you, Sarah with an "h." - OK. - Here's your record. - Thank you. - And here's your pen. Thank you. Hey, thanks. What was that about? Oh, nothing. We were talking about Miles and how he likes to piss everybody off. - Yes, so do you, Chet. - Yeah. - What did she give you? - Uh, some pamphlet. What did she give you, Chet? She gave me dope, OK? I didn't ask for it. She just gave it to me. Baker, Baker, Baker... I'm Officer Reid. We spoke on the phone about your parole, yeah? This isn't going to cut it. What, you don't like the music? You got any requests? Yeah. I got a request. How about you get a real job? A real job? Is that Cole Porter? I don't know A Real Job. You know something? When I was a boy, my dad, he used to say to me that if a man sits in a barber chair long enough, eventually he's going to get a haircut. CHET: Wow, that's... That's very meaningful. It's... - It's wisdom like that that really... - Keeps you outta prison. You do want to stay out of prison, don't you? Yes. Well, then, why don't you do us both a favor and get a real job by the end of the week? - CHET: What am I gonna do? - You'll think of something. You think maybe we could get some, like, proper gigs? You're not ready. What are you going to do with that? Just go throw it away. I didn't ask for it. The dumb chick just gave it to me. No. I trust you. You went and saw Dick, right? What did he say? I told you, he said no. I mean, you know, I'm not going to beg him. At this point, I'd do anything. JANE: Thanks for changing your mind, Dick. DICK: I'm glad you called. You know, it's almost worth it to see Chet in a sombrero. JANE: How is he doing? DICK: Oh, he's... struggling. You said he'd never play again. Well, I don't know what's worse; Chet not playing or Chet playing mediocre. Well, it's going to take time, Dick. You know that. DICK: How are you doing? I'm still here. Give him a contract over the summer. What are you? His new manager? You jealous? No. Time here costs money. JANE: So, put him in the back. Mix him out. Oh, right, and of course, keep paying him. Listen, we need to eat. So, get us to do stuff. We can paint walls, fix things, - whatever you need. - Chet Baker, handyman. - He pumped gas in Oklahoma. - You serious? You know, this is the first time I've seen him sweat. Everything came so easily for him, musically. I think that was one of the problems. You think he'll ever play high level again? DICK: Kill it. - Yeah. - Somebody's out of tune. It's not me. Somebody's outta tune. (NO SOUND) MAN: Next. I mean, did you do the line about the vegetables, like we talked about? I mean, that was funny. And they didn't like that? This isn't what I came here for. Hey, come on, people don't know anything about talent. Nothing at all. I mean, think about it, most musicians today... I mean, their playing is 100 years ahead of where the listeners' ears are. I'm not talking about talent, I just want to get a job. You will, I promise. It was easier in New York. Can we just be blue tonight? But I don't want to be blue. # We'll have a blue room # For-two room # A new room # Where every day's a holiday # Because you're married to me # Not like a hall room... # A ballroom... Does Baker show up every day? You... You read my report. I mean, he's been playing sessions and he's been helping out around here. We painted those walls over there. OK. Just he's got this probation review coming up tomorrow and he's still short of hours, so... You guys take a break. Chet, can you come up here for a second? CHET: Who's in trouble now? - Hey, Mr Baker. - Hey, Officer Reid. I was just saying you've got this review tomorrow, and you're still shy of a few hours. So I'm not sure how we're going to work that out. He can do some work later. There's some dry-walling to do. - I mean, if that helps. - Yeah, that helps. Can I stick around, make sure it happens? - DICK: Sure. - CHET: I can't dry-wall tonight. - Your parents are flying in. - Doesn't matter who's flying in. I don't wanna break my promise to Jane. I won't stand up in front of Judge Hays tomorrow and say you're shy of hours. I have to say something. Do you realize it's people like you that killed Billie Holiday? - What? - Do you realize that? No, it's true, it's true. What does that have to do with anything? Just do the hours. - Cops harassing her day and night. - Holiday died of a heroin overdose. Dick, can I go back to work, please? - She was a junkie and... - JANE: It's not worth it. That went pretty well, I thought. CHET: OK, round two. Here we go. Alright. Are we set? Hit it. REID: You know, I've been working with junkie musicians for over 20 years. I have never seen anyone work this hard before. - Yeah. - Or stayed clean this long, right? - Yeah, that's a miracle. - Must be love. That's why you give him the hours. Write it out. Give him a tick. REID: Give him a tick? You gotta promise me one thing first. Get him some half-decent clothes to meet your parents in. It's a deal. Nice! MAN: I bought our boat about 12 years ago. - I love being out on the water. - CHET: Yeah, me, too. I used to have a Pacific cat. It was a 19-foot catamaran. - Wow. - Yeah. And now you're squatting in the back of my daughter's van? CHET: Yeah. That's true. Some of my colleagues found out Junebug was living with Chet Baker and all they could talk about was wasted talent. CHET: Oh, they must be critics, huh? Real talent, Chamberlain, Bird, always flourishes. But then there's the type that promises more than they can fulfill. I listened to your records. I see you here today, Mr Baker, and I wonder if that's all there is. A white man's promise. I'm going to be a good husband to your daughter, sir. - Are you asking for her hand? - Uh, yeah. I guess so, yeah. Elsie told me you've asked for Junebug's hand twice already. - But you never bothered to call me. - Well, we don't really have a phone. Uh, hey... So your father has some colleagues at work that know everything there is to know about Chet Baker, huh? I mean, here's the deal, alright? I don't mind if you wanna give me a lecture about being responsible or anything like that. But if you start talking to me about music or talent or Bird... you know, I might have to say "Fuck you!" JANE'S FATHER: Let's cut the crap. You were a drug addict, right? Yeah. Would you want your daughter to marry a man like you? JANE: Dad! You know, why don't we head back? Get some ice cream. I'm going to go for a swim. Where are you going? JANE: Chet! Chet! Chet! What are you doing? Huh? (CHET PLAYS OVER THE RAINBOW) What'd I tell you? Surprise, surprise, man. DICK: Maybe poor technique will actually give his sound, uh, character. Like the old Chet, but deeper. Nick! It's so good to see you. Good to see you. Chet sounds so amazing. You should get him a gig. Hmm... (PLAYS PIANO) This is, uh, Danny Friedman. - Hey, Chet. - Hey, Dan. - Dizzy's promoter. - Been a while. Yeah, I know who he is. That was something else, man. He's doing this West Coast tour. He might be able to help you get a gig. - That'd be OK. - Wow. You know, this is the first place I saw you recording in. - Right... - That's it, you and Mulligan. - Trading solos. - Mm-hm. Wow. This was the birth of West Coast swing, baby. That's what they say. I got an idea, bear with me. Why don't we do a gig here? Yeah, yeah, that could be nice. A couple more execs and promoters. He dims the lights, it's fun. Play some tunes. Dick, what'd I tell you? I'm only here until Monday. - OK, well. - We'd do Birdland if you want. In a couple of weeks? - I wish. - You're out Monday. - Is Sunday good for you? - Yeah. After four. - After four. - Yeah. So...? What are you thinking? Be fun. - Eight o'clock? - That'd be good. That'd be good. Alright. Chet, it's good to see you, man. We'll have a good time. - See you Sunday. - Alright, see you, D. - We'll have fun. - It'll be nice. - I'll see you guys Sunday. - Hey, say hi to Dizzy. I will, brother. Did you just do that? You did that. Now I see why I pay you the big bucks, Dick. You make some big bucks, then you pay me. You're not half as bad as everyone says. Hey, Jane! - Jane! - She left. - She left? - Yeah. - Where did she go? - Uh, with that... - She left with that director Nick? - Yeah. How's she supposed to get an acting gig if she never leaves the studio? Come on, Chet. Try to be happy for more than ten seconds at a time, alright? Forget about that movie. You've got a big show to think about. ACTOR PLAYING DICK: He's just jealous, Chettie. - What a jerk! - Don't let him get to your head. Why the fuck would you bring up the polls? - Honey, calm down... - Don't touch me! Get off me! Good night. Don't be there all night. See you later. He's married with kids! So that mean he doesn't like to have sex, huh? Did he hit on you? Yeah. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna go for it! He knows that! Come on, all guys do the same thing. They play games, right? Just remember I haven't had a job since you screwed up the last one. Alright. But... So you two went off and you rehearsed together? Yeah. That's exactly what I did. But I was helping you with that audition. Hey, Chet, just calm down. He's the director, he can get me the job. Oh, so he's the big shot? So he's important? - Come on, I can't do this all the time. - No, no, you... Are you leaving me? Huh? Is that what you're doing? Is that what's happening? - Don't be silly, Chet. - I know that... I'm pregnant. So why don't you ask me again? Two seconds... Here. Hold this, OK? And hold this. Alright. Have it back. Will you marry me? What is that? This is extremely valuable, alright? This is a valve ring. Yeah, I will. It's the valve ring to the first trumpet my dad gave me. You can put it on a chain, you know? That way... you won't lose it. You're not gonna lose it, are you? No, I won't. Beautiful. - I love you. - I love you, too. Settle, people. We are recording tonight's performance, so... be quiet. And if you could hold your applause until after every song, it'd be much appreciated. Not too quiet. Chet? - Ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. (TAKES DEEP BREATH) - (DOUBLE BASS NOTE) - Hold on. I'm not ready. - I wasn't ready. - (CHUCKLING I MURMURS) Can we try it again? GUEST: This is a waste of time, man. DICK: OK, quiet again, everyone. Please. This'll be take two. # My funny Valentine # Sweet comic Valentine # You make me smile # With my heart it Your looks are laughable it Unphotographable # Yet you're my favorite work of art # ls your figure # Less than Greek? # ls your mouth # A little weak? # When you open it to speak # Are you smart? # But don't change a hair for me # Not if you care for me # Stay, little Valentine # Stay it Each day is Valentine's # D8)' Bob, Leonard. Hey, Bill. Well, Bob, thanks for staying. I really appreciate that. Dizzy and Danny are over there. Oh, shit. So I see. Excuse me for a second. - Hi, Mr Baker. - Please, don't arrest me now. - Dizzy Gillespie's over there. - Dizzy...? Get outta here! That is him. Jane told me the good news. Just wanna say congratulations. - Thanks. - When's the big day? - As soon as possible. - OK, I see you wanna go. - OK, thanks for coming. - Keep your nose clean, alright. Hey, man! Excellent show, excellent show! - Beautiful, beautiful stuff. - Thank you, thank you. You're not going clean, are you? I'm having a little party... I'm having a little party and... (WHISPERS) - OK. Yeah, yeah. - Please. Can we do it? - Jane. - Oh! Baby! You were so good. - Chettie... - Oh, hey, Danny. - Look who's here, my friend. - Oh, wow! Hey, Dizzy. - It's been a long time, Chettie. - Yeah, it sure has. Wow...! Danny boy said I ought to come by. Well, thanks for coming. What did you think? Well, you really pared it down, man. A little bit under the centre. Yeah. Always been like that. It was almost flat. Somehow it was still nice. - Thanks. - But you know, hey. You really shouldn't sing. - You know that, right? - Yeah. Danny was saying he's thinking about Birdland. - Look, you've come a long way, but... - But what? - Well, they only do special events now. - Dizzy... Come on, you've still got pull there. Everybody respects you. You got the key to the gate, you know? - You ain't ready for Birdland, man. - I'm ready. Miles said, "Come back once you've lived a little, you know?" Miles, yeah. That sounds like something he would've said back in the day. I lived a little. Look, you done your time, Chettie. Makes for some ragged phrases, but your playing is... Honest. It's honest. You got a sound that's all your own, ain't no denying that. And I'm ready to play Birdland. It's not your playing that I'm worried about. All things be ready if your mind be so. Are you sure you're ready to come back? I've learned three different embouchures, right? I got a left, I got a centre and I got a right. And if you let me sing... OK, I can play two full sets before my teeth fall out. OK? Eyes on the prize. God, you're a glutton beggar. I'll get you Birdland. But don't say I didn't warn you. - That's amazing! New York City! - We fly tomorrow. But I've got my call-back, you know that. Well, you're gonna miss that. This is a big deal, baby. Well, no, it's a big deal for me, too. I know, I know. I can't play Birdland without you. - Yeah, you can. - No, no, come on, it'll be so much fun. - You can do it. - We get a fancy hotel. It'll be fun. We can fuck. A little drinking, a little dancing, a little night life! Sounds all great, but you know I gotta get this job. This is important to me. And besides, I think it'll be really good for you, too. To go alone. No, that wouldn't be good for me, at all. I don't want to go alone. But I'm always there for you, Chet. But I gotta do this for me, right? You know how I gotta spark off you. No, you've got to have more faith in yourself, Chet. Your best music was when you were clean. - Before all the drugs. - Yeah, not with the methadone. That shit's worse than a condom. - God, you think that's such a joke. - No, c'mon! Dick says if this show goes well, I'll be able to take care of everything. I mean, fuck that audition, we could be on tour in Europe, you know. - Fuck that audition? - You know what I mean. No, I don't know what you mean. - Come on. - What if it doesn't go well? Why would you say that? Come on, you're the one person who believes in me. Why would you say that? - Do you believe in me? - Yeah, I believe in you. - That's not the point. - That's exactly the point. Oh, please don't do this, please don't do this! - Please, please, come with me! - It's just a few days. I think you can go alone. Are you serious? I'm not some groupie, Chet. I'll go alone. (CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Chet. - Where were you, man? - Well, I'm here now, alright? Oh, shit. Miles is here, too? Why, everybody's here. (MUMBLES SONG LYRICS) - You want that done all the way up? - Yeah, I like it tight. # And though they'll think us rather rude... - You want that tight or you want it...? - Yeah, tight. # Crazy (VOMITS) A little bit nervous! That's... That's good. Here, rinse... Rinse your mouth. With Miles and Dizzy out there, you've every reason to be. I'm not nervous, I'm sick. You need an aspirin? You getting a cold or something like that? I'm not getting a cold. I ran out of methadone, you know. What'd you say? Two days ago, I ran out of methadone. You... You stopped taking your medicine? - Chet, come on! - Don't give me a hard time. You've got every cat on the East Coast out there waiting for you to play the biggest gig of your career and... I don't want a career, Dick! I told you that. If I wanted a career, I'd get a fucking job! OK? I wanna play! - All I wanna do is play! - Hey, hey... Where's Jane? - Where's Jane? - She's in LA. She has an audition. OK. OK... Look at me. It's going to be alright. Jazz cats from all over the world, someone out there has some methadone. - You think? - Yeah, relax. Good? # Let's get lost... Sit down. You're making me feel nervous. You'll be fine. - You look good. - Thanks, Dick. Dick, where the fuck is Chet? He... We need a little more time, OK? Dick? Where the fuck...? Fuck me! Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go. (DOOR OPENS) Chettie, I found some methadone. I didn't take no for an answer. Remember Johnny Rad... Fuck. It's all going to start again. Jane will leave you. I don't think I can play otherwise. Don't risk it. Don't play, then. Or... Take the methadone. I mean, you've been playing great on it. You have. You sounded great. You said that if I really nail this show, there'll be lots of gigs, right? Maybe a European tour? DICK: But I thought you didn't want a career. I want my life back. Dick, come on. I want to play music the way that I want to play it. You know this is my last chance. - DICK: No. - Yes. - DICK: No. - Yes. DICK: No, but it is a chance. But if you... If you sing with the tongue of angels but you have no love, then you're a clanging cymbal. What...? What does that mean? I don't want you to be empty out there. It gives me confidence. It does. Time gets wider, you know. Not just longer. And I can... Oh... I can get inside every note. I can. - DICK: Every pretty note. - Yeah. DICK: But that's you. That's all you. It's always been you. Your choice. Come on, cat. I didn't think you were coming. - They changed my dates. - Nice. - How's he doing? - Great. Is he coming out soon? I ain't got time, man. This dude can't play anyhow. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on. Miles, it's my fault. Sit. Hello, Dizzy. Hello, Miles. There's a little white cat on the West Coast... gonna eat you up. (APPLAUSE) # I've never been # In love before # Now all at once # It's you # It's you forevermore # I've never been # In love before # I thought my heart was safe # I thought I knew the score # But this is why it That's all too strange # And strong # I'm full of foolish song # And out my song must pour # So please forgive # This helpless haze I'm in # I've really never been # In love # Before Will you give this to Chet? I'm sorry. Don't be sorry for me. (SILENCE) (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE BUILDS I WHISTLING) Thanks. Born to Be Blue. (PIANO INTRO) (TRUMPET BEGINS) Subtitles: BTI Studios English SDH
