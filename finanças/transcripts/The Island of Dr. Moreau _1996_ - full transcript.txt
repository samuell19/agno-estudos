Our plane crashed in the endless Southern Pacific... and we drifted for days between life and death. On the sixth or seventh day, the two men who had survived with me... began to fight over the last canteen of water. They fought like beasts, not men. Positively no other survivors. Run preliminary tests? What's the point? Okay, Okay Feeling better? Where am I? You're on a seafaring vessel named the Ombak Penari. Who are you? My name is Montgomery. And you are? Edward Douglas. I was on my way to Jakarta. My plane... went down. I'm working on uh...an assignment for the United Nations. I'm working on the peace settlement. There was a lot of blood on that life raft. You were the only survivor. Yeah. I need to get to a radio... -Whoa, whoa, whoa! - You need to calm. Just be calm. - I'm still hydrating you. There's no radio on this vessel. I'm gonna pay the captain of the ship to take you to Timor... which is about four days after they drop me off... - at my little island paradise. - What are you giving me? Oh, you'll like it. I like it. It's a little Jimi Hendrix. Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Well, I'm more like a vet. Excuse me All right. all right. Don't be rude. There you are. - What's going on? Where are we? - This is Moreau's Island. There's been a change of plans. You've got to come with us. - Well, maybe I should stay on here. - If you come ashore, we've got a radio... and we'll get you off the island in a couple days. Of course, the choice is yours. You can stay on the boat here, but these guys are real party animals. Captain Penari here has taken quite a shine to you, if you know what I mean. It's really best if you come with me. Can I give you a hand with the rest of the things? No, that's all right. The others will take it. The others? The islanders? Yes,... the islanders. How did this get here? Well, the Dutch were the first whites to settle the island in 1890. They had a coffee plantation. And then the Americans took it over in World War II. Japanese bought it and tried a hotel resort... which went belly-up. I used to have a rabbit as a little boy... called Keasey. Died... from my own neglect, I'm sorry to say. I've never been very good with animals. He's a beauty. He, she... What's going on in your head? Oh, good lord! - Hold him - Oh, please. We don't actually eat meat here... but I'm sure the doctor will make an exception for you... our special, unexpected guest. It'll be our little secret, okay? Come on. That's a very impressive communications centre The only problem is nobody can fix it but me, and it was down before we left. I'll get it up and running soon. Don't worry. I'm gonna have to ask you to restrict your movements to the main house. The people who fund this project are afraid you're gonna sprain an ankle and sue us. Well, it's a litigious world. Yes. Uh, Stay right here... I won't be long. Eh!.. I'm sorry. - It's all right. - Who are you? I uh.. I just got here. I came on the boat this morning with uh ..Montgomery. Come from the sea? Well, originally, I'm from England. England? That's another island. - Yes. - I've read about it in many books. My name's Edward Douglas. Edward Douglas. You have such beautiful hands. - So beautiful. - Well, thank you. Are you from this island? My father brought me here. Dr. Moreau? And where are you from originally? Getting acquainted? She's beautiful. Yeah. She's a pussycat. I've arranged some quarters for you upstairs. Wonderful. I saw the Nobel Prize. I think I remember Moreau. Didn't he vanish or something? I thought he was dead. No. He's still working. What exactly did he win his prize for? He invented Velcro. I see. And how long has he been here? Seventeen years. He became obsessed with his... animal research. Animal rights activists drove him out of the States. It got so bad you couldn't cage a rat without reading him his rights. And how long have you been here? I wrote a.... paper that was published... and.... we started correspondence....So - about 10 years ago, I came out... helped him with his work. Eventually... [Laughs]... Let me show you to your room. Well, it's...nice very agreeable. Look, I don't want to be an imposition here. And as soon as you can get this com sat equipment working... I can...uh... They'll send a plane for me. - Why have you locked the door? - This is for your own good. Montgomery! Montgomery! Oh, my no No! Listen. Listen. I can help you to get off this island... but only if you promise never to do or say anything that will hurt my father. We must go. Now! Eddie, there's a lot of unstable phenomenon out there. - It's all right. - You from boat! He's a 5-finger man. He's a 5-finger man, like you. See? Look. Look. Good. My name Assassimon. Assassimon! Assassimon, you must help us find Sayer of the Law.... Quick. Come, come. Come! hurry! Come! Come! The punishment to those who break the law was terrible. None can leave It is a hard way. The way of being a man. Sooner or later, we all want a thing that is bad: To walk on all fours... to suck up drink from a stream... to jabber instead of saying the words... to go snuffling at the earth and claw the bark of trees... to eat flesh or fish, to make love to more than one... every which way. These are all bad things. These are not the things that men do. We are men, are we not? We are all men We are men because the father has made us men! Sayer of the Law. Another 5-man has come to hear the law and the wisdom. The father sent for you? You are here to help him in his work? The other 5-man is looking for us. Please help us. Montgomery. The father! The father! Bring the 5-man. No! No! Release him. Give him the gun. What? Give him the gun. He's very frightened. Give it to him. - No! - No, no, no. No! Douglas, no! He won't hurt her. Mr. Douglas, I beg you, please do not confuse them. Move back. Move back! Stop! For god's sake, stop! Calm yourself, Mr. Douglas. Don't add more pain to their already diminished lives. Why have you done this? Don't you feel the heat.... because I do? I, I, I can't tolerate the sun... and what it's doing to me, and what it's doing to all of us... to all life on earth. We must return to the compound. Keep the weapon if it comforts you. Mr. Douglas, first of all, for the sake of propriety... I would like to present my children. Hello. I am Waggoi. How do you do, sir. I'm Azazello. My name is M'Ling. You've already met my beautiful daughter, Aissa. Majai, would you present yourself, please? He means you no harm, Mr. Douglas. He's just trying to be polite. He just wants to shake your hand. Thank you. This is the most outrageous spectacle... I have ever witnessed. Look at yourself! I understand that I must be shocking to you. However, I must also point out... that I have an allergy to the sun, and that's why I've put this medication on. Look at these people! Look at him! Mr. Douglas... I don't think that I have the intellectual ability... to condense 17 years of study and experiment... into 17 minutes of explanation. For the moment, it will have to suffice to say... that the people that you witnessed before... living under my care and protection... are animals that have been fused with human genes... in the course of a series of scientific studies... designed by myself. Well, has it ever occurred to you you might have totally lost your mind? I mean, this is just Satanic. Judge not, Mr. Douglas, that ye be not judged... for by these judgments shall ye also be judged... and let he who hath not sinned cast the first stone. There is no peace, saith the lord, unto the wicked. I think perhaps this is not the time to continue. We will have dinner at 8:00. I hope that you'll be in another state of mind to be slightly more receptive. "Somewhere in sands of the desert... the shape with lion body and the head of a man... is moving its slow thighs. The darkness drops again... but now I know that 20 centuries of stony sleep... were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle... and what rough beast, its hour come round at last... slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?" M'Ling, that was just beautiful. Thank you so much. Shall we toast? Your health. Thank you. Well, Mr. Douglas, very good of you to join us. Please tell me. Is the devil still pursuing you? Well, perhaps you could explain to me what you mean by the devil. You seem to be on terms with him. Well, permit me, Mr. Douglas, to tell you something of the devil... as I've come to know him. The devil is that element in human nature... that impels us to destroy and debase. And what are you about upon this island but destruction and debasement? Oh, well, I can tell you very plainly. No, please don't do that. For 17 years, I have been striving... to create some measure of refinement... in the human species, you see. And it is here, on this very island... that I, sir, have found the very essence of the devil. What do you mean? I have seen the devil in my microscope... and I have chained him. And I suppose you could say, in a sense, metaphorically speaking... I have cut him to pieces. The devil, Mr. Douglas, I have found... is nothing more than a tiresome collection of genes. And it is with great assurance that I can tell you... that Lucifer, son of morning... is no more. Well, I don't see how any of this specious nonsense... justifies these monstrous disfigurements. Well, very simply, they represent a stage in the process... of the eradication of destructive elements... found in the human psyche. And I have almost achieved perfection, you see... of a divine creature that is pure, harmonious... absolutely incapable of malice. And if in my tinkering, I have fallen short of the human form... by the odd snout, claw, or hoof... it really is of no great import. I am closer... than you could possibly imagine, sir. Aah Oh.... ooh What is that? Rabbit fricassee, master. Stop that! Oh, god! Get this out of my sight! Azazello, who's responsible for this? Mr. Montgomery requested it. Go into the kitchen. Leave. All of you, go into the kitchen and wash your hands. Mr. Montgomery considers this a sort of amusement, I suppose. No one saw me kill it... except you. Well, I have no way of knowing. What do you mean? We saw one in the forest with its head torn off. - And who was responsible for that? - It was Lo-Mai. Good god. You bloody fool. All right, I want everyone outside... in the compound tomorrow. Well, Mr. Douglas, perhaps we can entertain you a little more than you anticipated. We're going to have a trial tomorrow. Not to kill for pleasure. Not to kill. Not to kill for hatred. Not to kill anything, anytime. That is the law. That law has been broken! None escape. None escape. None shall escape. Who is he? Who has done this? Evil is he who breaks the law. Do you hear, Lo-Mai? Do you hear? Lo-Mai? I forgive you, my son. Father. Lo-Mai has broken the law. He killed a living thing. Why? Oh, my god. What have you done? I am sorry, Father. I thought you wanted me to protect the law. Where did you get this gun? The law is not to kill... for any reason! See that his body is shown all manner of respect. Yes, master. [ He screams in frustration ] [ He is emitting sound of sorrow and longing ] Lo-Mai. [ A scream of sorrow ] [Screams in pain ] I saw very little of Moreau as the crisis broke. Oh, god. He was in the laboratory working away... in pursuit of his dream to create a perfect human race. Nothing was said of my attempted escape. Montgomery, who had once been a brilliant neurosurgeon... was reduced to being the beast people's jailer... and now he had become mine too. It's turned completely yellow. Now No It's almost opaque. See? Nothing. So we'll simply have to increase the dosage. [Clears throat] Would you get the inoculation gun, M'Ling? You... boar me. Go, go, go. Good girl. Good girl. - Hi, sweetie. - What is it you're giving them, exactly? It's a combination of endorphins and hormones. It's keeps them from retrogressing. Retrogressing into what? Well... It isn't pretty. Well, it certainly seems to improve their mood. Oh, that's my contribution. I add a little methamphetamine... some morphine, some 'shrooms, and some other shit. Keeps them mellow. Keeps them... Well, keeps them coming back for more. Well, it hasn't brought him back. - What? - There. Hyena. Come! Come! It's okay. Come on. Come get your shot. Come on. Hyena. Hyena. Look. Look at my hands. Look, okay? It's okay. It's okay. We won't hurt you. That's right. That's right. Come on. Hyena, come! That's right. That's right. Come on. What? Pain... no more. What? No. Christ. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - You don't understand. - What's going on? - Christ. He pulled it out. What? - His implant. He pulled out his implant. They all have implants. It's how we shock them into submission. We have to find him. Dart him and get him back to the compound. A hunt, master? Hunt? Yeah. Yeah, a hunt. Azazello likes a good hunt. Get him! Get him! Move it! Move it! [A peal of laughter] This is Biostation Helix calling on all channels. Is anybody receiving me? Are you certain you know how to use this? Yes. I make many calls for the doctor. I read the books and learn. I make it work. Not without this, you don't. Fetch. Who do you think you're gonna call? What are you gonna say if you get somebody on the horn? "Mayday, mayday. I'm being held captive by a pig lady"? You gonna sell Aissa to the circus? You know, she's not like us. She's very delicate. They all are... but she needs her shots too... and she's not gonna get them off this island. There's so much you don't understand. Why don't you smoke this? Maybe you'll start. There's no way off the island. You must face the fact. Why was I brought here? I was brought here, wasn't I? I can't find Hyena-Swine. I think we should before the others get the same idea. Oh, my word. You startled me. How are you? Well I... I think I'm just simply going to perish from this heat. I...I cannot bear it. The longer that I'm here, the worse it gets. And, I mean, this damn Montgomery won't fix anything. I'm dying of heat. I think that... Yes, my caloric converter is empty. Would you fill it, please? Yes. That's much better. Oh, god, yes. Oh, yes, god. Oh, please. Forcefully. Forcefully. Oh, no. Oh, my god. Not so strong. You have no idea how strong you can be. You must be very, very careful. Father, I must talk to you. Of course. What is it? I'm changing. Well, that's nothing to be frightened of, darling. Let me see. Yes. Yes, there are a few changes. However, let me have a look. Yes. Yes, your ears are developing. - I'm hideous. - No, no, no. Darling, how can you say that? You're an absolute angel. You're beautiful inside. You're beautiful outside. You're an extraordinary creature. Help me. These small things are just a question of chemical imbalances, that's all. - No, no, no. Don't be upset, darling. - I want to be like you! Will I never be like you? Well, I hope not. I mean, how would you look if you were like me? You see? I've made you smile. Mine! What a surprise. I didn't mean to startle you. I just thought I heard someone stirring about down here... and I thought I'd come have a look. No, no. I did hear it, probably. But I heard... Would you like a biscuit? No? I was listening to this music. It was rather interesting. And did... Were you playing? - No? - Well, perhaps it was you. Well, in any event, you see, it reminded me of a man named Schoenberg... this sort of music... and I would like to demonstrate something which might be of interest to you. You can all just relax. And... Well, you see... there is a sort of music called tone music... and it sounds... sort of like that, you see? But there is another kind of music... and there was a man named George Gershwin... who played this... Lovely. I know, my son. I know. Father, I must ask a question. Please. What am I? We call you father... yet we are not like you. What are we? Father! You are my children. You are all my children, you see? Now, I think perhaps it might be helpful if you would go over there... and then we could discuss this, and I could explain to you exactly. Now, be calm. Be calm, please. I want to tell you something very important. I want to tell you something very important... and I just... Everyone, be calm. And just relax and be seated if you would, please. Because... you see, one of the things... Tell me. Why you make the pain... if we are your children? You see, you are my children... but law is necessary. If there is no more pain... ...then is there no more law? There is always law. - Pain no more. - Good god. What are you doing? To walk on all fours... that is the law. Please. To slurp up our drink, that is the law. We are not men. To eat flesh and fish anytime... ...that is the law! Now I am the law! None shall escape. That is the law! Father! Is there still law? There is still law. Yes. But how can there be law without the father? He hasn't left us. That is what I will tell the others. That his spirit is watching over us. We must wait for a sign. It's all right. Were it not for you... I should say that your father had failed... terribly. But you're not the same as them. Nor are you the same as me. You are something far, far finer. It's a process. I'm changing. There's a serum Montgomery used to give me. It's in the lab. It can stop my regression. Please. Help me. "Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged. And with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye... but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye. Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam that is in thine own eye... and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote of thy brother's eye. Neither cast ye your pearls before swine... lest they trample them under their feet... and then, give not that which is holy unto the dogs." What does she need? - Animal or man? - What am I looking for? You're very angry. "Neither test nor start...." Listen. Listen.., Don't fuck around. What do I need? What do I need? Tell me what I need! Where is it? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Where is it? Shut up! Where is it? Where is the serum? Who's the animal? Who's the animal? Be calm. Calm. We've got to think and reason this through together. Tell me. I destroyed the serum. All of it. Hyena. Kill him. I have the fire that kills. I know where there's more. Fire that kills. I know where there's more. Now show us And though I give my body to be burned... and have not charity, I am nothing. And though... I give all my gifts to feed the poor... and though I give my body to be burned... and have not charity, I am nothing. You know, Sherlock Holmes... once asked Dr. Watson: "Did you notice the remarkable thing... about the dog barking in the middle of the night?" Dr. Watson said, "I heard no dog barking." Sherlock said, "That's the remarkable thing." Aah.... Little woofer. Well... things didn't work out. Moreau wanted to turn animals into humans and humans into gods. But it's instinct and reason, instinct and reason. What's instinct to a dog? To hunt. To kill, master. To run with the pack. I want to go to dog heaven. Douglas. He said... ...he was closer to his goal... than I could possibly imagine. Do you remember? See, I was led to believe... he had saved my life... when, in fact... all the time... he intended to take it. He intended to... What? Use me. He intended to use my DNA to stop your regression. Well, anyway... he is dead... and Montgomery is... insane... ...and has... He's destroyed all the serum. Go. Go! The guns! How do you do, sir? I believe we've met. Drip, drap, drip, drap. And where are you going in the woods today, little girl? Oh, my little kitten. Fetch! Nicely now, little kitten, or I'll hurt you. Remember... remember how the master whipped me? But he never touched your soft skin, did he? No! Come on. Come on. Tell them that I am the law. Do not believe him. He is not the law! Hyena! Good doggie. 5-man... please tell them... that I am god. You're right. - You are a god. - No! Again. You are a god. You're all gods. Tell them... to obey me like they did the father. You all killed the father. You all ate his flesh. So who is the new father? Who is god number one? Who should they obey? Him? Or him? You see, there must be... a god number one. Father. Father. Why? You! Stay. Douglas, you stay here. You stay with us. I'll be back. I'll come back. There must be people who can... Doctors, scientists... who might understand what Moreau was trying to do. Perhaps they could develop a serum, stop the regression. No. No more scientists... no more laboratories, no more experiments. I thought you would be able to understand that. We have to be what we are... not what the father tried to make us. To go on two legs... ...is very hard. Perhaps four is better anyway. This is a true record of what I saw. I set it down leaving out only the latitude and longitude of the island... as a warning to all who would follow in Moreau's footsteps. Most times, I keep the memory far in the back of my mind... a distant cloud. But there are times when the little cloud spreads... until it obscures the sky. At those times, I look about me at my fellow man... and I'm reminded of some likeness to the beast people... and I feel as though the animal is surging up in them... and they're neither wholly animal nor wholly man... but an unstable combination of both... as unstable as anything Moreau created. And I go... in fear.
