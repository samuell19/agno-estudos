It's open! Hey, Henry. Hey. The hershey people emailed. I just forwarded it to you. What's going on in here? A minor panic over this dish for the conference. Well, it smells great. Don't worry, you always freak out before these things, and end up making something amazing. Ah... Can I have some, I skipped breakfast. Yes, you can, but do me a favor, okay? Don't skip breakfast. You always get hangry with the clients. "Hangry?" Hungry plus angry equals "hangry." Oh, speaking of clients, I got a weird call for you today. From a Kathleen Evans? She says she's a journalist, she met you at a party. She's desperate to talk with you. She said it was quite urgent. They always say that. No, it sounded serious. She was just confirming that she'd see you at the event this weekend. Hmm. Did she leave a number? No, she wants to talk to you in person. Does she sound cute? You know, Lucy, most people would kill to come with me this weekend. Obviously, I'd tag along if I could, but I'm going to be the only single girl at a bridal shower. Oh, wow. Isn't it gorgeous? I can deliver it to the station for you if you want. No, no. I've got it. Yeah. Thought you might say that. The cross-checks on the St. Vincent case. Thank you. Price, you all right? You're looking kind of pale. I'm fine. I'm just a little tired. All right. There you are, price. I need to have a word with you. I just got off the phone with hr, who are all over me because apparently you have six weeks of vacation time you haven't used up yet. I, uh... You've also racked up too much overtime, and you haven't used your rollover days, which the union is on my back about. I need you to take a vacation. Well, I can't take one now, I've got cases. Well, the boys can take over. - Done. - No, no, no... Munro? Let go. Where's the birthday girl? Henry? What are you doing here? There she is. What are you up to? Oh, just bringing you a triple chocolate cake from portolla's on your special day. That's my favorite place. How did you know that? I listen. It's your birthday? Happy birthday! I got you a little, uh, you know, uh... Yeah, something in the car... Yeah... - A card. - Uh, flowers! Flowers... Chocolate. Yeah, you'll love it. Nice to see you again, Maggie. Yeah, hi. So, if we didn't know, how did you know? We're Facebook friends. You should try it sometime. - Facebook? - Friends. All right, guys, I'll get some plates. So what's new in the gourmet world? Where are you jetting off to this week? Well, this weekend, I'm staying local, actually. I'm attending a gourmet conference at the larkspur pines resort. Fancy. Man, I picked the wrong job. You know what, I have a second suite paid for and sitting empty all weekend. My assistant had to cancel on me. You're welcome to it. Tempting, but I work all weekend. That's too bad. We have top chefs coming in from all over the country, serving incredible food and wine. There's a free spa package. You're making it worse. Well, that's perfect because price is taking some forced r&r. Wait, what? As of 6:00 tonight, you are on vacation, whether you like it or not. Now, if you want to stay home and watch paint dry, that's up to you, but only a crazy person turns down a free vacation. That is a great idea. I'm not going away with you. Away with me? No, we'd be going in tandem, not together. I'm going to be working the whole event, so you'd hardly even see me. A selling point for sure. Thank you, but no thank you. Why? What are you afraid of? Being surrounded by a hotel full of pretentious foodies tops the list. Ah. Okay, I get it. What do you get? It's not your thing. You'd be uncomfortable. You don't think I could fit in? No, I'm sure you could, it's just not your scene. How do you know what my scene is? For the record, I fit in everywhere. Sure. You just can't relax enough to actually enjoy it. That is so true. That is so not true. What about the holiday office party, hmm? We do karaoke. My cyndi lauper blew the roof off. Look, I know you like to think of me as boring, old uptight Maggie, but you have never spent any downtime with me. Great, come with me. Let your hair down. Fine, I will. - Really? - Yeah. Great! That's settled. What, did you go home for these? I'll pick you up tomorrow. Perfect. There you go. Thank you. Mom, this shirt is tragic. When did you become the fashion police? When you started committing fashion crimes. See? I don't have anything to wear. I shouldn't even go. Of course you're going. Please go, Mom. Why are you so happy to see me leave? Ah, when Mom's away, all the rules go out the window? We're spending all day tomorrow at the boardwalk. First, we're going on the giant dipper, then the undertow... Then the fireball, then the cliff hanger... And then we're gonna go see a double feature. And get popcorn with extra butter. And sour patch kids for dessert. Wow, you guys have it all worked out, huh? Yes, we do, so there's no point in arguing. Get packing. Say hi to Henry for us. I'm going to miss you guys. So, what is this weekend about exactly, anyway? Oh, it's just a gathering of chefs from around the country, all trying to outdo one another while acting very nonchalant about the whole thing. So, are you nervous? Me? No. No... No? I mean, you must be feeling the pressure a little bit. No. No pressure. I'm just going to enjoy the weekend. That's all. Hmm. Well, then, that makes two of us. I already booked a massage for when we first arrive. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Way to embrace the experience. Thank you. I'm just sorry there's no karaoke. Cyndi lauper? I would literally pay to see that. Because you assume I'm terrible. No, no, not at all. You'd never do anything in public if you weren't great at it. Oh, come on, that was a compliment. Wrapped up in a put down. My ex-husband used to do that. It was really annoying. All I'm saying is that I'm glad you haven't completely shut the door to having fun in life... You literally just did it again! You make me sound like I am a total drudge. When, in fact, I am a fun person. Okay. A really fun person. - Great. I believe you. - Good. Of course, if that were true, you wouldn't be quite so defensive. You know you have a ridiculously clean car. Thank you. That wasn't a compliment. Not bad. I told you. By the way, I gave you the presidential suite. I'm taking Lucy's room. You're welcome. Henry... Henry Ross? I'm Evelynn de witt. Of course. Nice to meet you finally in person. Hi. Detective price. Uh, Maggie price. Off duty and ready to relax. Well, you've come to the right place. The bellman will take your bags. If you'll follow me, please. All right. I'm sorry, I was under the impression that you were bringing your assistant. I booked two separate suites. Yeah. Oh. Oh, no, we're not... No, no, no. No, no, we work together. No, we don't. Well, sometimes, we do. One time we did, and not by choice. Okay, well, the welcome reception is at 6:00. I hope you can both join us. Oh, and, just a little fyi, Danielle stark will be joining us at the conference this weekend. Wait, the Danielle stark? She's preparing to play a chef in her next movie. Well, look, I mean, if she would like some tips, I would be more than happy to show her a couple of things. Mm-hmm. Just... Shall I show you upstairs? Actually, I'd like to first check on my food deliveries, make sure that everything has arrived for my presentation tomorrow morning. Of course. Would you like to see the kitchen? Uh... I'd love to, but, um, I actually have a massage booked, and a presidential suite to settle into. Hmm. I gave her my room. Smart move. No, honestly, it's not like that. I'm really not trying to... Wow. This I could get used to. Yeah. So, you're sure... Yes, the rest of your ingredients will arrive this afternoon, I promise. We have more deliveries coming. Lucas, look who I have. Oh... Henry Ross! The gourmet detective himself, great to finally meet you. It's a pleasure. Gretchen, get over here. Oh. Gretchen is my sous-chef and my wife. Hi. It's nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. Lucas, I have read all of your reviews. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So, where did you study? I don't really believe in culinary schools. I learned everything I needed to know from mentors in real kitchens, in the real world. I hear you, I came up exactly the same way. How did you end up here? That was all me. I stole him away from a wealthy family in Colorado. They used to throw these huge fundraisers, which is a great training ground for working here. We're very lucky to have them. Well, the reception starts in about an hour, and I still have some preparations to make. If you'll excuse me. Of course. Henry, I'm sure we'll have a chance to catch up over the weekend, but I gotta... Yeah, yup, go. Hey! Who's watching this? How hard it is to keep stirring a pot? Just like this... Pick it up, please. So... a private chef. Sounds like a dream job. It was. Must be a big change coming to a busy place like this from a private home. Ashford was much quieter. Everything now is... Busy, as you can see. If you'll excuse me, I need to get back to work. Of course. Oh, wow, these are some tight shoulders. How long has it been since your last massage? Um... I think my daughter was six? So, I've got my work cut out for me. Definitely. Well, feel free to dig in. I'm spending the weekend with someone who drives me completely crazy. Sounds like there's a story there. Oh, no. No story. He's just a friend. Sort of. I mean, don't get me wrong, he did give up the presidential suite for me, which was a bit surprising, but most of the time, he's just quite opinionated and a total snob. And he's one of those people who thinks they have your number, when really they do not know you at all, and you just want to, like... Sorry. Put me on a massage table, and, apparently, I start over-sharing. Oh, don't worry about it. You'd be amazed what people tell me in this room. I'm sure. Your friend is attracting a lot of attention. Better get in line. Next time you're in New York, you give me a call, and I'll get you into any show you want to see. Well, I might just take you up on that. Here's Henry. Why are you standing there empty-handed? - Thank you, Lucas. - My pleasure. Do you know Maggie price? Oh, Maggie and I go way back. High school sweethearts, in fact. Really? He's joking. Do you all know each other? Henry, Michael castellano. - Michael. - Pleasure. He owns two restaurants in New York. - And this is... - Eric helberg. You know, I keep reading about your new restaurant. I have to confess, though, I haven't been over to marin county yet to see it myself. I would be honored if you dropped by, to be honest, I'm actually a pretty big fan of yours. Ah. Yeah, I've been reading the gourmet detective blog since college. Wow. I don't feel old at all. Eric was just inviting me over to his restaurant, and promised me the chef's table in his kitchen. Well, aren't you the belle of the ball? I'm just keeping the door open to fun. Didn't take you long, did it? Michael, come over with me, please, I'd love to introduce you to a friend of mine. Maggie, can I get you another drink? Well, that would be lovely, thank you. There she is. Danielle stark. Oh, good. Henry was wanting to give her some cooking tips. Here's your chance. Why don't you go introduce yourself? Oh, well, um... She, uh... You know, she looks a little busy. I think I'll wait a bit. Are you nervous? What? You are. No. You're too nervous to go and introduce yourself to a movie star, aren't you? That's too bad. I thought you were going to show her your moves. I meant show her some cooking tips. Of course. Hi. Here you are. Hi. This is Kathleen Evans, she is writing a profile on me for "modern trends magazine." Kathleen, this is Henry Ross. I believe we've met, right? That's right, yeah. Kathleen, this is Maggie price. - Hi. - Nice meeting you. You too. Mm! Have you tried these? Oh. No, I haven't... Uh, my assistant said that you wanted to talk to me about something? Yes, but, um, I can't talk here. Can I call you later, and we can set up a time to meet? Yeah, of course. - Perfect. - You! Danielle... You have a lot of nerve showing up here. Well, I didn't know you'd be here. Why don't we go talk outside? Oh, now you want to be discreet? That's pretty funny. Come on, Danielle, we don't want to cause a scene. Do you know what that little video and your article cost me? The studio took away my three-picture deal, and no one would hire me for three years because of you. You ruined me. So, one of us is leaving this hotel, and it's not gonna be me. Danielle, let's go outside for some air, all right? How dare you show your face anywhere near my client after everything you did. You're lucky we didn't sue you. I didn't make her behave that way. No, you just taped it and put it online. You need to pack your bags and leave. Hey, man, why don't you calm down? Hey... Eric, it's fine. I'm not going anywhere. Well, we'll see about that. Who was that guy? Danielle's manager, John Harper. He's a little over-protective. Journalists aren't always the most popular people in the room. If you'll excuse me. As fun as this is, I have a date with a hot bath and a good book, so good night. Good night. Awkward. I can't believe it's only 8:00. I guess that massage really knocked me out. Turns out relaxation is exhausting. Ah... Well, I guess this is good night. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Okay. So, just tell me, though, is the suite amazing? Incredible. Yeah. I knew it would be. Well, I'm just going to be down the hall, in my very un-presidential suite if you need me. Good to know. Yup. Good night. Hey, Henry. Hmm? Thank you. For the room. You're welcome. Oh, my god. Maggie! Maggie! What? There's a woman in the mineral baths, face down. - What? - Please, come on! Okay, hold on. She was right here. I'm telling you. That you saw a woman relaxing in a hot tub? No, Maggie, I'm telling you, there was a woman floating face down, right here. Well, you were pretty high up, Henry. Hey, look at this. This is Kathleen's. She was wearing this this evening. She wanted to talk to me about something. She called Lucy and said that it was urgent that she see me this weekend. About what? I have no idea. Well, maybe she just had too much to drink and she fell in the pool, and came to and pulled herself out, or somebody helped her. Well, if that's the case, she couldn't have got very far. Ms. Evans? It's Evelynn de witt. Look, we checked the locker room down in the spa, the front desk has called her on her cell and in her room. She's not answering. We'd really just appreciate it if you would let us look inside her room, Ms. De witt. Ms. Price, I... Detective price. If you don't mind. Thank you. Hello? Ms. Evans? Henry, are you sure about what you saw? Maybe Ms. Evans stumbled... Well, then she'd be up here getting changed. She's not walking around the hotel soaking wet. Wait, there's her computer charger. Maggie, do you see her computer anywhere or her cell phone? This looks like her computer bag, but it's empty. Look, I think we need to call this in. Whoa, wait a minute. The police? No, we're not calling anybody yet, okay? We don't have a body. Without a body, this is a missing persons case at best. And even then, not until she's been gone for 24 hours. Maggie, somebody moved her. Somebody may have moved her, and if something did happen here, then whoever did it is probably staying at this hotel, in which case, they're not going to want to attract attention by leaving. Are there security cameras at the mineral bath? No. What about inside the spa doors? No, most of the cameras cover the front desk, the lobby, and some of the hallways. I need you to keep this under wraps for the time being, and just keep the conference going as planned, if possible. That's fine. Just please let me know if you find her. Of course. So... So, I think the best plan is for us to start looking into this quietly. I can do that. I mean, under the radar. I can do that, too. Just follow my lead. Fine. Okay, I checked every locker, there's nothing in there. There's no towel, there's no clothes, there's no cell phone. Take a look at this. Looks like a men's 10 or 11 to me or maybe a woman wearing a man's shoe to throw us off. Okay... Uh, if she was killed, then whoever killed her must have left her in the mineral baths for a minute. Maybe he needed to get a coat, or something to cover her up to get her out of here? I heard people laughing over there on the terrace. That's what brought me out on my balcony. That might have scared him off for a minute. He came back here, tracked these prints all over the place, pulled her out and went to hide the body? It's not likely that he went back into the hotel, which means that she is... Out there. That's going to be easy, trying to find a hidden body in over 50 acres of woods, in the dark. We have to go look for her. Now. We don't even know if she really was killed. I think what we need to do is just get focused and try to figure out who may have done this. At least then we'll know where to start. Come on, let's go back inside. Oh, wow. Seriously? This is what I gave up? Yup. Oh, come on, there's an upstairs? Hey, Bailey, it's price. I need you to run a background check for me. You serious? You're supposed to be on vacation. I know, I know. Just please... Oh, come on, you gotta be kidding me. Look at this place. Okay, what's the name? Kathleen Evans. She's a reporter for "modern trends magazine." What's going on? Well, I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out. What? And you're not going to tell us, are you? Nope. You have a funny way of relaxing, price. So I've been told. Hey, listen, don't tell forsyth I called, okay? All right. You got it. Thank you. Okay, that bathroom is bigger than my first apartment. You could fit six people in that shower. Do you want to trade suites again? Kinda. Too bad. Check this out. I think I found something. Excuse me, you're talking while I'm rehearsing? Do you understand what rehearsing is? I am the reason people come to the movie! All of you have your jobs because of me! Any if anybody talks while I'm trying to work again, I will have you fired. Do you understand me? Fired! Are you recording this? Yikes. Wow. Doesn't look like this article is very flattering either. Danielle said this bad publicity cost her a three-picture deal. Okay, so, Kathleen tanks this woman's career, then they bump into each other at a spa, and all of a sudden, Danielle goes into an outrage and kills her? I don't know, it just doesn't make sense. I think I have a better theory. The manager? Exactly. Yeah, we should definitely question him. I think I know where to find him. Really? Where? Um... right down there, carrying what appears to be a dead body. Where? Look. They were heading this way. There they are. - Hey! - What are you doing? Who is that? What's it to you? Look, we're just getting some air. Is that okay with you? It's still early. Let's go back inside. Look, I was going to bring her upstairs to her room as soon as I could get her vertical. But I'd appreciate it if you could, you know, be discreet about this. Of course. She must be pretty upset about what happened at the reception. Yeah, you could say that. She's got quite a temper, doesn't she? She's emotional. That's what makes her a good actress. Oh, hey, I know, I'm a huge fan of hers. In fact, I wanted to talk to her about her next picture. Evelyn mentioned that Danielle might want to learn a few tricks of the trade from me, but then you two left the reception so early. Well, we went up to my room so she could cool off a bit, and then she went down to the bar. You didn't go with her? I can't babysit her every minute, which I regret now, because the bartender called me and told me she was making a scene. Look, the last thing we need is people pulling out their phones and putting more of her antics online. Yeah, we saw that video of hers. Feisty. You're understandably protective. Although you were kind of hard on Kathleen, if you don't mind my saying. I mean you basically th... threatened her. She's got a lot of nerve showing her face around here. And not just Danielle. She wrote an article about Michael castellano, too, and it ruined his life. He was telling me all about it. It's so easy to hide at home behind your computer, but people like her need to realize that their targets are real people, and words have consequences. Look, it's getting cold, and I've got to get Danielle upstairs. If you'll excuse me? Of course. Dani, come on, we've got to go. Dani? Okay, that back there is called antagonizing a suspect. What? I thought we were doing good cop-bad cop. I'm just saying you're lucky that he didn't get scared away. Hey, I got information out of him. Henry, can you please just let me take the lead? All right, I'm going to call Michael castellano and invite down to the bar for a drink, but first, I'm going to freshen up. Sounds like a plan, all right, I will meet you down at the bar. Uh... no. I didn't mean us. I meant just me. But we're a team. I just I think that I'll get more answers out of Michael if I handle him on my own. Are you sure? Because I really think this good cop-bad cop thing is working for us. Henry, let me question him alone. If I learn anything new, I will call you. Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning. Uh-huh. You sure that's all this is? Just questioning? Oh, please. He's very charming. I'm going now. Just remember he is a suspect in a murder investigation. Are you jealous? No. I am just looking out for you. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Goodnight. I got it. You're laughing at me. No. It's not funny. I was already 5'8" by the time I was in middle school. You should have seen my junior prom date. He literally came up to my shoulder. You're breaking my heart. I'm serious. Have you seen these shoes? Size 10. You wouldn't understand, you look like you have normal-sized feet. Size 11. See? Men's 11. Perfectly average. There's nothing average about you. Or this place, because it is so beautiful. Yeah, this is my third visit, and it never, ever disappoints. No, because it's so elegant here. That argument at the reception was a bit awkward, wasn't it? Danielle stark really lit into that journalist. I guess that's movie stars for you. Kathleen had it coming. Really? Oh, yeah, I've been on the receiving end of her so-called journalism. You're kidding me. What happened? Well, let's just say that certain things that I thought were off the record were clearly not. And the article cost me my marriage. Oh, that's terrible. Yeah, you don't know the half of it. You know, I have a small confession to make. I, um, I looked for you after the reception. You did? I thought maybe we could, you know, take a walk around the grounds, or something. I was up in my room. You should have called me. Oh, well, I would have, but, um, you know, I didn't know if maybe you had a guest, or... No, I was totally alone. Trust me, a call from you would have been most welcome. Gretchen. - Hi. - Oh, hi. How can I help you? Wow. That... Is a beautiful terrine. Thank you. Those aren't easy to make. It's Lucas's. It's one of his signature dishes. I'm just finishing it off for tomorrow. If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were spying on my kitchen, Henry. No, I'm just admiring your work. I told him it was yours, Lucas. Oh, she's very talented in her own right. I bet. How can I help you? I just wanted to check on the rest of my order, see if it had arrived for my presentation tomorrow. Sure thing, I'll take you right back. Okay. So, about last night. Just so you know, I wasn't spying on you. Of course not. Maggie, I just happened to see you, that's all. Yeah. Okay. So, here's what we know. I read Kathleen's article that she wrote about Michael, where she broadly hinted that he was having an affair. Which I'm guessing was probably true, since right after the article came out, his wife filed for divorce. Oh, and... He's a size 11. Not entirely sure how you got him to tell you he's a size 11, but okay. Which means we now have three suspects with motive. We have Danielle, John and Michael. However, Danielle we can cross off the list, because I spoke to the bartender last night, and he confirmed that she was, indeed, making a scene in the bar at the time of the murder. However, Michael told me that he was up in his hotel room alone. So neither he nor John have an alibi. Nope. There's also something going on between Eric and Kathleen. What makes you say that? Well, I saw them at the reception last night. Eric put his hand on her back, and she just... pulled away. Maybe they were dating and got into a fight? Well, murder always comes down to one of two things, love or money. So, it is a murder? What it is... Is strange. And unless she magically appears today, yes, I believe it is. Okay. You know, I'm giving my presentation this morning, right after breakfast. Everyone's going to be there. Why don't you come watch and do a little snooping around? Yeah, that's a good idea. You know, I also want to ask Evelynn if she'll let us into the security room after that. Did you just admit that I had a good idea? Hey, hey, come on, I told you, it's fine! Oh, man, come on... Stop calling me about this. It's done. I took care of it. Nah, she never saw it coming. Nah, good riddance. She deserved it. Hey, guys, it's me. I need you to run another background. His name is Michael castellano. He's a well known chef out of New York City. Another background check? Are you sure this isn't an investigation? Nope. Not yet. Oh, and another thing. Can you call the editor of "modern trends magazine"? Try not to raise any alarm bells, but see if you can find out what Kathleen was working on. Price, what's going on? That's price? Yeah, hi. I was just calling in to let you guys know I'm having a great time, relaxing, et cetera. Good. See, I told you you would appreciate some time off. You were 100% right. I will see you back at work. Bye. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Wow. Delicious. Mm. This may be the best omelet I've ever had. Better than the one that I made you? How your ego can be both enormous and fragile at the same time is beyond me. It's a gift. Henry, Maggie, good morning. Ah, good morning, Eric. Hi. Are you coming to my presentation later? Yeah, absolutely. I wouldn't miss that. Listen, have you, um, have you seen Kathleen anywhere? Because I was supposed to meet her for breakfast, but she didn't show up. I've been calling her and texting her, and she's just not answering. Uh, no, I haven't seen her, I'm sorry. I didn't know that you two were an item? Me and Kathleen? No. No... Ah. My mistake. Anyways, if you do see her, can you just... Have her text me? Of course. We'll let her know that you're looking for her. Great. Thank you. Okay. Lying. Totally. Hey... I was hoping you'd come. I saved you a seat. Oh, thank you. So, I was thinking maybe we could go for that walk later? Just take in the grounds? That's an idea... I don't know if you're aware of this, but, um, our hotel suites are across the hall from one another. Are they now? Well, that's convenient. Okay, welcome, everyone. In keeping with the spring theme of the conference, today, I am going to be making my spicy shrimp panzanella. It's a versatile dish, and it also makes use of the tail-end winter Greens, which are still available. I heard the weirdest thing this morning. You were in the hallway on your phone. I couldn't help but overhear you say something a little strange. You said, uh, "good riddance? She never saw it coming"? So, what are you, eavesdropping on me now? Who were you talking to? Why do you need to know? Um, call it professional curiosity. You've got to be kidding me. You're a cop? Detective, actually. Did I not mention that last night? No, you failed to mention it. Can you please keep your voice down? I need to know if you really were alone in your hotel room from 6:30 to 8:00, and I need to know who you were talking to. What's going on here? Now, before I begin, I am going to need an assistant. I'm not at liberty to say, but I need you to answer the questions. Oh, really? Danielle... What do you say, huh? Are you going to charge me with something? Because if you are, I think I should go call my lawyer, and if you're not, we're done here. It was nice meeting you, detective. For those of you that don't know, Danielle is here at the conference learning how to look like a professional chef in preparation for her next role. So, Danielle, let's get you suited up with this apron first, okay? Would you mind tying that for me, please? Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Okay, I'm just, uh, I'm going around. Ooh. So, uh, Danielle, how do you feel about spice? I like my panzanella with a little kick. Oh, I say the hotter, the better. Well, you and me both. And what is your experience like with shrimp? Ordering it? Tons. Cooking it, not so much. All right, let's get to the basics here. I'm going to show you the best way to peel these so that they don't fall apart. I can be gentle. I can see that. Where was I? Oh, yes, I almost forgot... The most important ingredient... Premium aged rum. The darker, the better. Okay, how much of this do we need? No, it's not for the shrimp, it's for you and me. It makes cooking way more fun. Here you go. Bottoms up. Hey! So Danielle's totally fun. Yeah, it looked like you guys were having a great time. - How'd I do? - Great. Yeah? I mean, I tried to be informative yet still entertaining. You nailed it. Ready to get back to the case? Because Evelynn's been waiting. Yeah. Of course. Okay, what we need to know is where Michael castellano and John Harper were between 7:00 and 8:00. Now, do you have cameras on every floor covering the hallways? Yes, but they don't cover every room. Right. Michael was practically across the hall from me in 708. Can we check that, please? That whole wing isn't covered. Of course not. That would be too easy. What room was John, Danielle's manager, in? Room 507. 507 I'll check that one. There's 507 there. This is at 6:35 P.M. So, there they are entering the room together. Can you speed that up? All right, stop. 7:32, she leaves the room alone. Now, the bartender said that he remembers her being into the bar around 7:30, and that he called John to see if he could come down and get her around 8:45. Let's check and see if John leaves the room before then. Okay, there's John, leaving the room... Okay, here's John leaving the elevator... And entering the bar right there. So, John was telling the truth, he didn't leave his room all evening until he went down to collect her. Now, he's on the fifth floor, so it's not like he jumped off the balcony. Okay. Can we have a look at when Kathleen left her room? That would have been between 6:45 and 7:45. She was in 304. Sure, just give me a second. There she is. 7:30, leaving her room. Wait, who is talking to? There, you see? I told you they were an item. Not a very happy one. Let's follow where she goes. 7:40, she enters the spa. Evelynn, was there anyone working the spa desk last night? The receptionist leaves at 6:30. Look, there's Eric. Oh, my god, he followed her into the spa. Fast-forward for us. Let's see if he comes back out. Stop. That's us. 8:02. Eric never came back out. Okay, great. Thanks, munro. All right, the boys are doing a check on Eric. Okay, what number is Eric's room again? Evelynn said 306. Okay, it's this one up here. He must not be in. Oh, thank you, uh, listen, could I get a couple of extra packets of coffee, please? Sure. There you go. Thank you. You're a life-saver. Eric? Hello? Eric? Here we go, Eric's shoes. 20 bucks says that these are a size 10. Well, that's inconvenient. Size 12. Hey, look at this. This looks like Kathleen's day planner. What would this be doing here? Looks like a bunch of interview questions for Eric. No, wait, wait. Wait, stop. What does that say right here? "While clearly a talented chef, the first thing one notices about Eric helberg is his ego. He appears to care more about his PR and growing celebrity than he does about food. Whether or not he'll be a lasting fixture on the bay area's culinary scene, or just another flash in the pan, only time will tell." Ouch. Where did you get that? I think you know exactly where we got that. What were you doing in my room? We're more interested in knowing what you were doing last night when you walked into the spa right after Kathleen. Okay, what's going on here? Sfpd. We need to ask you a couple of questions. Where's Kathleen? Is she all right? This needs to stay between us, but Kathleen's been missing since last night. Oh, my god. A hotel security camera caught you and Kathleen fighting right out side her door before she left for the mineral baths. What were you two fighting about? About what was in there. She left her notebook in my room, and I was dumb enough to read it. Can you please tell me what is going on? Just answer the questions. Yeah, you were right. Kathleen and I were together, and I guess I'm an idiot because I thought that she actually liked me. The camera showed you following Kathleen right into the spa. Yeah? So? I was upset. I wanted to talk to her, she didn't want to talk to me, so I left. How did you leave? I walked off the terrace and then I walked along one of the paths. - To where? - I don't know. Just around the property. I needed to clear my head. - How long were you gone? - About an hour. And then I went back to my room. All right. Look, Eric... Since you were close with Kathleen, did she say anything to you about another article, or maybe another story she was working on? Anything that could have put her in danger? Actually, yeah. She said that she was working on something big. She didn't want to talk to me about it, but I know that she keeps everything in her computer, and there's a lot of notes in that book. But that is... That's everything I know. All right. Well, if you think of anything, let us know. Of course. I just want to help. Okay. So, what do you think? I still don't trust him. I think we need to figure out what the killer did with the body in the middle of the night. He would have taken it as far away from the hotel as possible. Not too far, because he'd have to be able to get there quickly. An out building maybe? Exactly. Let's go for a drive. Where? There. Henry... Let me drive. Nope, I'm driving! Come on, Henry, give me a break. No, I'm driving. You always drive. What are you talking about? You drove us here. To the resort. On the other case, you always drove the squad car. Of course, I drove the squad car, it's my car. I can't believe we're even having this conversation. It's ridiculous. You're very controlling, you know that? How am I being controlling? I'm letting you drive! Just saying. Oh, my... You might want to put it in forward, genius. I know that. Sorry! You keep walls up between yourself and other people, do you know that? What walls? I don't have walls. Really? Really. Seriously. What walls are you talking about? What walls? Well, you don't share anything about yourself. I do too. I share with a lot of people, just not people that I work with. Oh, so that's what I am, just some guy you work with? No, Henry, you're in a category all on your own. Thank you. That wasn't a compliment, Henry. So, come on, you must be a little glad you came, right? You mean, in spite of this whole murder? Sure. And you have to admit, we're a pretty great team. Let's not get carried away. We haven't solved anything yet. Munro, what do you got? Well, I pulled something up on Eric helberg. This guy is no angel, that's for sure. He's got one dui, and one prior for domestic abuse, coupled with a restraining order. Restraining order, huh? Yeah, filed by his ex-girlfriend. We also followed up with Kathleen's editor like you asked. Get this. Kathleen received several death threats three months ago. Three months ago? That's when her article came out on Michael. Speaking of castellano, turns out his wife owned everything, including both restaurants. When she found out about the affair, she basically fired him. He's filed for a chapter eleven. Really? Wow, okay, thanks guys. Call me if you get anything else. So Eric's not such a nice guy after all. Maggie? And get this, Michael has more motive than we thought. Kathleen didn't just destroy his marriage, she also ruined him financially. Maggie! What? I think we just found Kathleen. Well, judging from the cyanosis and petechiae from around her mouth and eyes, I'd say it's a pretty good bet the victim died of asphyxiation by drowning. I also noticed there was some bruising around her neck. Someone held her under? Yeah, it looks like it. Oh, my god. Poor Kathleen. I will also run a DNA check for underneath her fingernails. She would obviously have been struggling. We should keep an eye out for anybody walking around with scratch marks. Yeah. Price! I'd like you to come with me... What the hell is going on here? Hey, captain. The boys tell me that you've been calling in for background checks for the last 24 hours. Tell me you haven't been hiding a murder investigation while on vacation. Captain, I need you to trust me on this. I have purposely been keeping this quiet because I believe the killer is still here. Which is exactly why we need to lock this place down. I don't want him to get spooked. I'm telling you, we're onto something. We used the rear service entrance to keep a low profile. Forensics is almost done. They're going to be out of here in a couple of hours. Oh, price... Captain, please, we can use the element of surprise to our advantage. My instincts are telling me that this is the right play. I just need 24 hours. Your instincts, huh? I'm so close to cracking this, I'm telling you. Okay, you've got 24 hours, price, and not a moment longer. But if you screw this up, it's on you. What do you want us to do? Go to Kathleen's office, and take the death threats into evidence, see what the lab guys find out on them. You got it. Let's go find Michael. Lead the way. Excuse me, Michael. We need to ask you a few more questions. You know what? I think I'm going to call my lawyer now. That's a good idea. Because we found Kathleen's body. She was murdered. What? Your wife has a controlling interest in your restaurants. When Kathleen exposed your affair, you didn't just lose your marriage, you lost everything. She cut you off financially, and now you're virtually bankrupt. We also learned that Kathleen received several death threats at exactly the same time her article on you was written. All of which points at you being our number one suspect in the death of Kathleen Evans. Now, hold on a second, okay, just hold on. Now, everything that you just said is true, but I didn't do anything to Kathleen. Really? Because that phone call this morning sounded pretty incriminating. I was on the phone with my investors, okay? We just closed the deal on a new restaurant. The "good riddance" was in reference to my ex-wife. You still have no alibi for last night between 7:00 and 8:00 P.M. I just told you, I was in my room, making calls. You don't believe me, check my phone records. Hold on. I do have an alibi. Somebody was complaining about my cigar smoke on my balcony. The front desk must have called up at least a couple of times. They even sent somebody up to my room. Check with the concierge, he'll back me up. Michael's telling the truth. A person in the room above him called downstairs twice. We log all complaints. A member of our staff went up and spoke with Michael personally at 8:00. Okay. We know that Kathleen didn't enter the spa until a quarter to 8:00. There's no way that Michael could have killed her then was back up on his balcony five minutes later smoking a cigar. How long am I supposed to act like there's nothing going on here? I know that this is difficult. Please just bear with us a little bit longer. All right, but I'm getting very uncomfortable with this. We understand. Thank you for your patience. What about Evelynn? Does she have any motive for hurting Kathleen? I'm impressed. You're starting to view the world like a detective. Everyone's a suspect. Well, she is acting pretty calm for someone who just had a murder happen in her hotel. I agree. But I did a basic check on her. No priors came up. I think I'm going to go up to my suite and start going through Kathleen's notebook. See if I can find anything useful in there. Okay. While you do that, I'm going to go sit in on some more presentations. To investigate. - Mm-hmm. - For the case. We're supposed to... Act natural. Yeah. Bring me a doggie bag. There you have it. Spring halibut with vierge sauce along with fried gnocchi and asparagus. Thank you. Thank you. This recipe, along with all of my other favorites, will be on my restaurant's website. Please come check us out. Thank you, everyone. Excuse me, I'll be with you in just a minute. Henry, tell me that you found Kathleen. Uh... no, not yet. Well, we need to do something then. We are. The police are in involved. But, listen, Eric, I have to ask you some more questions. Detective price discovered that you have a prior for domestic assault. That your ex-girlfriend filed a restraining order against you. Yeah, look... That was my old girlfriend. She was really angry when we broke up, and she started accusing me of all these things. My restaurant had just opened up, I couldn't afford that kind of negative publicity. My lawyer told me to just take a plea agreement, have it all go away. I did. I regret it, because I was completely innocent. How did you get that scratch? I don't know. I must have done it this morning. What are we going to do about Kathleen? That's what Maggie's working on right now. The key in beef Wellington, as in life, is balance. Many delicate ingredients... Filet mignon, pate, truffle, pastry... In just the right proportions. And the arrowroot, please. Quickly. No, I said the arrowroot. Are you sure you don't want the madeira and then the truffles? Traditionally, yes. But if my wife would allow me a little leeway, this is my take on the dish. Thank you. I guess now that we know Michael has a confirmed alibi, that makes Eric our number one suspect. I don't know, I just don't think he's got the eyes of a killer, you know? You have a lot of experience looking into the eyes of a killer? I have a feeling if I keep hanging out with you, I will. You know, I saw something today at Lucas' presentation. He made a mistake, and Gretchen corrected him. I actually think that, of the two of them, she's the real talent. He's just good at putting on a show. I'll tell you one thing I know, though, that is an unhappy marriage. He strikes me as someone with a fragile ego. I kind of recognize the type. Is that a reference to your ex-husband? Yeah, actually. His name was Richard. We were married for 13 years. Wow, that's a long time. What happened? Another woman is what happened. I knew things weren't perfect between us, but, um, I kind of thought we were okay. He met her while we were on vacation in Hawaii. People wonder why I'm against vacationing. What about you? You ever been married? Uh, no. Why not? You don't want to be tied down? No, it's not that. I just haven't met the right woman yet, that's all. Yeah, it's getting late. See you tomorrow? Sounds good. Enjoy your room. Will do. What is going on with you? You want to do this now? Yeah, I do! This is not the time. It doesn't matter, Lucas. Why won't you listen to me? I don't know what you're talking about! You know exactly what I'm talking about. Just calm down. How am I supposed to calm down? What about our plans? Everything you promised me? Baby, you know I love you. I don't know anything anymore. Wait. Come here. Come here. I have to go to work. I know. Meet me later. I want to talk about this. Okay? Okay. Come on. Come on, Henry. Come on, come on. Hello? Hey, it's me. I've been looking for you. Where are you? Um... I'm at the gym. Why? I have something important to tell you, I'll be right down. No, no, no, don't do that. Yeah, I'll be there in two minutes. No! Wait! Wait, hold on. Uh... I may not be at the gym. I'll give you two a moment. Thanks, Ruby. Really? I thought we were investigating a murder, but, apparently, you still have time for a massage. Well, it was already paid for. I didn't want it to go to waste. Listen, I saw something very interesting this morning. I went down to the kitchen, and I nearly walked in on Lucas and Evelynn kissing. What? I know. They were fighting about something. I don't know what it was, but I did hear Evelynn mention that they had some sort of plan. Interesting. So... Gretchen is secretly the better cook, and he is having an affair with his boss. What does any of this have to do with Kathleen's murder? I know. Cucumber water. Want some? No, thank you. So, Ruby, how long have you worked here? About four years. Four years. And you were telling me earlier about how you're plugged into all the gossip around here. What could you tell me about Lucas and Evelynn? Like what? Like... How long they've been having an affair? Oh... You've heard about that. Yeah. I don't know how long it's been going on exactly. For years, though. Do you think Gretchen knows? It's an open secret around here, so I have to imagine she does. That seems like a pretty dangerous move, starting an affair with your head chef. Oh, you don't know Evelynn. She's the kind of person who gets what she wants. What does that mean? Well... You're probably going to find this out anyway, so... There's always been talk about Evelynn's dead husband. He died under pretty mysterious circumstances. She inherited a lot of money, including larkspur. What kind of mysterious circumstances? It was a boating accident. He fell overboard. No one ever charged her with his death, but people around here talk. She chartered a boat for his birthday. He didn't know how to swim. When did this happen? I don't know, several years ago. Before I worked here. Thanks, Ruby. Hey... Here's a link to the article on Evelynn's husband. "Max de witt, owner of the larkspur pines resort and spa drowned off the coast of San Francisco yesterday, when he fell off a boat he had chartered with his wife. He is survived by his wife, Evelynn de witt." Look at the date. Six years ago. Kathleen was investigating a six-year cover-up. We need to find Evelynn. White female, 40s, possible cardiac arrest. BP 82 over 55 and dropping, difficulty breathing... Victim called herself in with nausea, tremors, blurred vision... Everything's fine, guys. Let's please let the paramedics do their job, okay? We need to keep this whole area back here clear. Thank you. Okay, this may not be a heart attack. Excuse me. Maggie, I think she may have been poisoned with tetrahydrozoline. Eye drops. You need to pump her stomach immediately. Look, the symptoms are exactly the same as a heart attack, right? The dizziness, the low blood pressure, the nausea. Maggie, I tasted the saline in her drink. Trust me. You're sure. Yes. He works with us. If he says he detects the drug, then you should believe him. Reason to suspect tetrahydrozoline poisoning. We'll intubate and perform gastric lavage en route. Let's get her moving. I just heard. What's going on, Henry? What happened? Well, Maggie's on the phone with the hospital now seeing how Evelynn's doing. How did she seem to you this morning? Um, I don't think I saw her this morning. No, I think you did. The two of you were in the kitchen together. Um... Well... She seemed like she was feeling fine. Hmm. Did she? Yeah. Maggie, what did the hospital say? Is she all right? Yeah, they pumped her stomach, her vitals are stabilizing. So, that was a good call. Looks like she's going to be okay. Thank god. Lucas, if you'll excuse us a minute. Yeah, sure. Okay. How did you know she was poisoned? I saw this empty bottle of eye drops, and then I tasted the saline in her drink. I worked at a restaurant once, where a waiter was poisoned by his ex-girlfriend using eye drops. You know, people think that it just causes stomach upset, but it's actually a very dangerous prank. It causes symptoms similar to a heart attack, and if you consume enough of it, it can be fatal. Hmm. I'm going to bag these things up for evidence and get them checked for prints. Wait. What was the name of the drug you mentioned to the paramedic? Tetrahydrozoline. "Tetra." I couldn't find out what "tetra" meant. On its own, nothing comes up, but let's cross-reference tetrahydrozoline with these names. Shoot. A whole bunch of results adding up to nothing. Let's go back to basics. It's like you say, murder always comes down to one of two things... Love or money. Who would want to kill Evelynn? Gretchen, the betrayed wife. Ashford. Add ashford to your search. Ooh, look at this. "Mysterious eye drops, ashford, england." England? Not Colorado? April 6, 2009. Six years ago. "Restaurateur Edward Taylor collapsed while jogging through the countryside earlier this week. While his death was initially attributed to a heart attack, the autopsy revealed Taylor had been poisoned with tetrahydrozoline, the main ingredient in eye drops. Police are looking for two suspects, Bob Smith and Linda French, co-owners with Taylor of the belle Aurora, a popular local bistro. An arrest warrant has been issued for French and Smith, whose whereabouts are unknown." Click on their names. Yeah. Oh, my god. Look at that. They lied to Evelynn about Colorado. Excuse me, have you seen Lucas or Gretchen? They don't work Sundays, but Gretchen was just in here. She went down to the storage room. Yeah? Where's that? Down in the basement. Thank you. Munro, I need you and Bailey to get to larkspur a.S.A.P. I'm about to apprehend two fugitives wanted for murder. Their aliases are Gretchen and Lucas Miller. I'm headed into the hotel basement now. We're on our way. Maggie, wait for back-up. I can't. They're a flight risk. Aren't you full of surprises? You should go back to your room and stay there. Not a chance. Freeze! Sfpd. Put your hands up. I have to leave. You don't know what he's like. Stop. You mean Lucas? He killed Kathleen, and I'm next. And I think he's the one that poisoned Evelynn. I'm so scared. You don't have to worry about Lucas, but we need you to come with us, okay? That's not going to happen. Put the gun down. Put it down! Kick it over to me. You killed Kathleen because she was onto you. What I don't understand is why you killed that man in england. I poisoned him. But it was an accident... - Gretchen, don't. - What do you care? You haven't cared about me for years. Edward kept making advances. He didn't care that I was a married woman. He didn't even care that we were business partners. He just, he wouldn't stop. I swear to you, I didn't mean to kill him, I just... I just wanted to teach him a lesson. And I heard that eye drops can make a person sick. But I used too much. And then when the autopsy revealed that he'd been poisoned, they suspected us right away. Of course they did. We were his business partners. What did you think would happen? He wasn't supposed to die! They suspected us because Ed's will left the restaurant to us. We didn't even know that. Then the police found Gretchen's fingerprints all over his water bottle, and that was enough. They wanted to convict us. We had to run. We had no choice. And now I have to do it again. Come with me. All of you. Move! Hurry it up. Enough. Step away. Okay, you're coming with me. Walk. Don't do this! Don't! Don't! Don't do this again! Move. So why would you kill Kathleen in such a public place? I didn't want to kill her. I just needed to talk to her. We met by the mineral baths and I begged her not to print the story, but she didn't care. She didn't care what it would to do to us. We started to argue, and I pushed her, and she just fell into the water. So you held her under? I didn't have time to think. I couldn't just let her ruin everything. And when Kathleen started asking questions, Evelynn got suspicious and started digging into your past. Why would you use the eye drops again? Didn't you realize that that would lead us right to you? I'm not a cold-blooded killer, despite what you might think. I'm not an expert in how to get rid of somebody. I never wanted to hurt her. I love Evelynn. But she wouldn't stop asking questions. So you silenced her. If you don't stop talking, I'll silence you, too. Okay. Let's go. Open the door. There's nowhere to run, Lucas. Back-up is already on the way. That's why you're coming with me, as insurance. To where? None of your business. I've disappeared once, I can do it again. Keep moving. Hey, chef. Hey. Just keep moving. Okay... I'm sorry, I have to leave you here. No! No, please don't leave me here. Don't leave me! Freeze! Drop the weapon! Drop it! Lucas, don't do anything stupid, okay? It's over. I'm warning you, back off. Lucas, just put the gun down. We can talk this through. I'm not going to prison. Just let me walk out of here, I promise I'll let her go unharmed. That's not the way this works, Lucas. Put the gun down... Stay back! No, Lucas, wait! Lucas! I am so buying a set of those. Really? Come on, get up! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney... Did you see that? Huh? The frying pan? Right? Oh, brother. Well... We did it again. You know what this means? We're a good team? That I should run in the other direction when I see you coming. You are bad luck. Wait a second. I had never even seen a dead body before I met you. Maybe you're the bad luck. Henry... Bailey and munro told me that you saved the day. Thank you. It's my pleasure, captain. I'm the one who had to wrestle the gun away from Lucas. You nearly got yourself shot. And yet here I am, unscathed. Oh, and just so you know, price, this weekend does not count toward your vacation days. - But I... - Ah, talk to hr. I have a feeling that I'll be seeing you again. You know, I really like her. So... should we pack up? Yes. I think I've had enough of this place. You had me worried there for a moment. I had it all under control. Clearly. You had him right where you wanted him. I did. If you'd given me another moment, I would have disarmed him. Oh, is that what I was watching? Yeah, that's what you were watching. Who brings a frying pan to a gun fight? That frying pan saved your life. No, it didn't. It saved your life. No, no, no, that was all part of my plan to distract him... Oh, sure it was. Look, you should just thank me for escaping...
