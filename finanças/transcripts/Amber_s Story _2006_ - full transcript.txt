MY BABY GIRL IS OUT THERE ALL ALONE, AND YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS OR WHO TOOK HER. WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? GET OUT THERE AND FIND HER. DO SOMETHING, DAMN IT. DO SOMETHING! [SNIFFLES] YOU GOT KIDS, DETECTIVE? THREE. ONE'S IN COLLEGE, HOUSTON. SHE'S LIVING THERE. TWO IN HIGH SCHOOL. YEAH, THEY'RE HOME. IT'S HARD TO PICTURE YOU AS A FATHER. I GOTTA LEAVE IT BEHIND SOME DAYS. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT... ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS KEEP THEM SAFE, YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW-- EVERYTHING OUT THERE, I GUESS. KEEP THEM SAFE. [SOBBING] DONNA. DONNA, IT'S BEEN 48 HOURS. I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN. DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN? THERE'RE ALL KINDS OF STATISTICS ABOUT THIS. I DON'T WANT STATISTICS. FAMILY ABDUCTIONS, NON-FAMILY ABDUCTIONS. I WANT MY DAUGHTER. IN NON-FAMILY ABDUCTIONS-- WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER, DAMN IT? AFTER 24 HOURS... I DON'T CARE HOW MANY HOURS IT'S BEEN. THE CHANCES OF RECOVERING THE CHILD ALIVE... DON'T YOU SAY THAT. DON'T YOU SAY THAT. SHE'S ALIVE, DETECTIVE. IF AT ALL... [SOBS] ARE VERY SMALL. [SNIFFLES] SHE HAS TO BE ALIVE. MM-MM.

THREE, FOUR DAYS, PROBABLY FOUR. SATURDAY NIGHT. YEAH. THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT. LET THE CORONER CONFIRM IT. THERE'S NO BLOOD. I'D GUESS HE KILLED HER SOMEWHERE ELSE, THEN DROPPED HER HERE. ANY SIGNS OF RESTRAINT? NOT THAT I CAN SEE. ANYTHING ELSE, I WANT TO KNOW RIGHT AWAY. I MEAN NOW. OKAY, DETECTIVE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE TOOK HER AT THE WINN DIXIE ON SATURDAY, KILLED HER SOMEWHERE ELSE FOUR, FIVE, SIX HOURS LATER, DROPPED HER HERE AT DUSK THAT NIGHT. I WANT EVERY BLADE OF GRASS THAT'S TURNED WRONG. GRIFF, THEY'RE ALL TURNED WRONG. LOOK AT THIS PLACE. DO IT ANYWAY. HE LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND, AND I WANT IT. WE DON'T TELL DONNA UNTIL WE MAKE A POSITIVE I.D. SON OF A BITCH. GOD-DARN SON OF A BITCH!

JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. YOU KNOW, WE WERE READING THE BIGGEST BEAR. LORD, HE LOVES THAT BOOK. MY GOD. AMBER LOVED IT, TOO. THAT BIG OL' THING KEEPS COMING HOME NO MATTER WHAT LITTLE JOHNNY ORCHARD DOES TO IT. WELL, AMBER'S COMING HOME, TOO. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP BELIEVING THAT. CLEAR ACROSS THE STATE, EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT HER. TOOK 'EM FOUR DAYS TO FIND OUT, MAMA. EVERYBODY'S PRAYING FOR HER. ALL OF TEXAS. NEWS IS ON. [SETTING DISHES ON COUNTER] [GRANDMA]: EVERYONE, THE NEWS IS ON. POLICE RECEIVED THE 9-1-1 EMERGENCY CALL AROUND 7:30 THIS EVENING. [FEMALE REPORTER]: WE NOW GO TO ASHLEY CHAMBERS WHO IS LIVE AT THE SCENE. [CHAMBERS]: EARLIER TODAY, A MAN WALKING HIS DOG CAME UPON A PALE, WHITE FEMALE CHILD, DEAD IN A CREEK BED. AS OF NOW, THERE IS STILL NO OFFICIAL IDENTIFICATION OF THE BODY, BUT POLICE BELIEVE IT COULD BE AMBER HAGERMAN, WHO WAS ABDUCTED FROM THE WINN DIXIE ON EAST ABRAM STREET LAST SATURDAY AT APPROXIMATELY 3:30 IN THE AFTERNOON. DESPITE BEING ABDUCTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, ARLINGTON POLICE WERE ABLE ONLY TO TRACK DOWN ONE EYE-WITNESS... [SIREN WAILING] [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [DOORS SHUT] THIS IS PART OF THE CRIME SCENE NOW. MOVE EVERYBODY OFF THE LAWN AND AWAY FROM THE HOUSE. NO EXCEPTIONS. BABY, I NEED YOU TO WAKE UP FOR A MINUTE, OKAY? THINGS ARE GOING TO GET REALLY BAD AROUND HERE. IF YOU GET CONFUSED OR ANYTHING, I JUST NEED YOU TO TALK TO ME, OKAY? I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT. OKAY, YOU CAN GO TO SLEEP NOW. [♪♪♪] [SNIFFLES] DONNA. OH... OH, NO. DONNA... IT'S NOT HER. WE HAVE THE FINGERPRINTS. IT'S A MISTAKE. IT'S A POSITIVE I.D. NO. NO. I WANT TO SEE HER. I WANT TO SEE MY BABY. I WANT TO SEE HER. I'M VERY SORRY. OH! NO! [SOBBING LOUDLY] [♪♪♪] WE STARTED PASO IN APRIL, THREE MONTHS AFTER AMBER WAS MURDERED. WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO CALL IT "PEOPLE AGAINST SEX OFFENDERS," AND THAT IF WE WERE GOING TO GET TOGETHER, WE WERE GOING TO REALLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS WE WERE GOING TO DO AT THE TIME. BUT WE KEPT MEETING, 'CAUSE WE WERE NEVER GOING TO LET ANYBODY FORGET AMBER. AND THEN, ONE DAY, WE ALL JUST KIND OF SAID THAT WE HAVE THIS EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM FOR BAD WEATHER... WHY CAN'T WE HAVE ONE FOR ABDUCTED CHILDREN? 20% OF THE KIDS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN IN NON-FAMILY ABDUCTIONS... ARE FOUND DEAD. [SIGHING] THREE OUT OF FOUR OF THEM, 75%... ARE FOUND DEAD WITHIN THE FIRST THREE HOURS. I KNOW THAT THESE JUST MIGHT BE FACTS TO YOU, BUT THEY'RE MORE THAN THAT TO ME, TO US. [SOBS] MY PRECIOUS LITTLE NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL... WAS JUST RIDING HER BIKE. SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO NO ONE, AND YET SHE PAID THE MOST TERRIBLE PRICE WITHIN THOSE FIRST THREE HOURS. [INHALES SHARPLY] CONGRESSMAN FROST... SO WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP US. FOR AMBER, YOU KNOW? AND FOR ALL THE OTHER INNOCENT CHILDREN. DONNA, I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS MYSELF. KEEPING OUR KIDS SAFE HAS GOT TO BE OUR FIRST PRIORITY. [SIGHING] I'M NOT GOING TO LIE TO Y'ALL. POLITICS IS A COMPLICATED BUSINESS. I CAN'T PROMISE THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT I CAN PROMISE THAT I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE IT REAL. SEEMS LIKE, FIRST OFF, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET THE POLICE ON BOARD, THEN WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIND A RADIO STATION TO SIGN UP. THEN WE'RE GOING TO NEED A BILL. [♪♪♪] [HORN HONKS] I AM SO SORRY THAT I'M LATE. YOU KNOW, I STARTED DOING SOMETHING AND I LOST TRACK OF TIME. I-- I-- LET'S GO, LITTLE ONE. HI, GLEN. COME ON. HOW WAS SCHOOL? OKAY. HERE. SEE YOU TOMORROW, NICHOLE. BYE-BYE. HERE WE ARE. SO, HOW DID YOU DO ON YOUR SPELLING TEST? GOOD. E...VA...POR...A...TION? E-V-A... P-O-R... A...T-I... O-N. HEY! PRE...CI...PI...TATION. GOT IT RIGHT. [PAPERS RUSTLING] [CHUCKLES PROUDLY] OH, MY GOO-- YOU GOT THEM ALL RIGHT! THEY'RE ALL-- IT'S-- WELL, PERFECT. OH! OH, MY GOSH. I THINK A REWARD IS IN STORE FOR YOU, YOUNG LADY. MOMMY SAID NO MORE SHOPPING. OH, COME ON! LOOK, Y-Y-Y-YOU WORKED HARD. YOU-- YOU DESERVE SOMETHING PRETTY. WE WON'T BE LONG. [ENGINE TURNS OVER] [TELEPHONE RINGING] HEY, LINDA. HEY. YOU DOING VEGAS NEXT? NO. ATLANTA. YOU? I GOT VEGAS, SEATTLE, SAN DIEGO, DENVER. I'M GOING TO BE GONE 10 DAYS THIS MONTH. NO IDEA WHY I DO THIS. I KNOW WHY I DO IT. NICE HOUSE, NICE CAR, NICE TRUCK, ONE DAUGHTER IN COLLEGE, ONE AT HOME. NO HUSBAND. WAIT A MINUTE, SCRATCH THAT-- EX-HUSBAND. I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING. [BOTH LAUGHING] 514 AND 672, DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING? YES. UH... 514 TO DENVER... 672 TO SAN DIEGO. GREAT. SO WHO WATCHES NICHOLE? HER DAD WHEN I'M OUT OF TOWN. WELL, WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE HERE? I'VE GOT THIS GUY NAMED GLEN WHO PICKS HER UP AFTER SCHOOL. HE JUST LIVES AROUND THE CORNER FROM US, BASICALLY BEHIND THE HOUSE. HE PICKS HER UP, THEN TAKES HER BACK TO HIS PLACE. I SPEND THANKSGIVING WITH HIM, HE HELPS NICHOLE WITH HER READING, HE HELPS WITH HER HOMEWORK, HE HAS HER WAITING OUT FRONT FOR ME WHEN I GO TO PICK HER UP. THEN WHY DON'T YOU SOUND HAPPY? HE GIVES HER JUNK FOOD WHEN I TELL HIM NOT TO. OH, COME ON. ALL KIDS LOVE TO EAT JUNK FOOD. YEAH. LISTEN. HE TAKES HER SHOPPING, WHEN I TELL HIM NOT TO DO THAT EITHER. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I'M GOING TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE. THEY'VE GOT THIS GREAT NEW AFTERCARE PROGRAM AT THE SCHOOL I'M THINKING ABOUT. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. HOW MANY BABYSITTERS DID YOU BURN THROUGH BEFORE THIS GUY? FIVE. AND YOU'VE KNOWN HIM HOW LONG? TEN YEARS. SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? YOU'VE KNOWN HIM FOREVER. GIVE HIM A BREAK. HE DOES THINGS I DON'T WANT HIM TO DO. IS THAT A CRIME? OH... VERY NICE. ISN'T THAT NICE, HUH? TURN AROUND. ISN'T THAT NICE? OKAY. JUST THESE. THEN WE'LL PICK ONE, AND WE'RE DONE. YOU LOOK ADORABLE, SWEETHEART. SHE'S CUTE. THANK YOU. IS SHE YOURS? YEAH, SHE MIGHT AS WELL BE. I WATCH HER EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL. HER MOTHER WORKS VERY LONG HOURS AND TRAVELS ALL THE TIME. I'M JUST LIKE A PARENT TO HER, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. I'M... I'M JUST LIKE A PARENT. HOW'RE YOU DOING, NICHOLE? COME ON, GLEN, WHERE IS SHE? [CELLPHONE AUTODIALS] [SIGHING] GLEN, HI. IT'S SHARON. I'M SITTING OUT FRONT. WHERE'S NICHOLE? GLEN? [HONKING] OH! SORRY. [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] [SIGHING] COME ON. [ENGINE STARTS NEARBY] [♪♪♪] [POUNDING] GLEN? [YELLING]: I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! GLEN, OPEN THE DAMN DOOR! SHARON, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT. NO. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT AT ALL. YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE EVERY RIGHT, GLEN. SHE IS MY DAUGHTER. THAT'S ENOUGH. LET'S GO. BUT YOU'RE NEVER THERE FOR HER. YOU'RE WORKING. YOU'RE ALWAYS WORKING-- WORKING, WORKING, WORKING. I AM THE ONE WHO'S RAISING HER. SEE THIS? YOU THINK IT'S EASY BEING A PARENT? WELL, TRUST ME, IT'S NOT. BUT DO YOU APPRECIATE ME? NO, NO, NO, NO-- NO, NO. Y-Y-Y-Y-YOU-- YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME. YOU TREAT ME LIKE DIRT-- LIKE THE DIRT ON THE TOP OF YOUR SHOES. GLEN, YOU ARE SICK. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON IN HERE, BUT IT IS NOT RIGHT. I-I-I-I'M UNDER PRESSURE. OKAY, WELL, NOT ANYMORE. FROM NOW ON, SHE GOES TO AFTERCARE AT THE SCHOOL, GLEN. DO YOU HEAR ME? YOU ARE DONE. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, SHARON. THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. OUT OF OUR WAY. SHARON! THAT'S-- THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE! [STAMMERS] SHARON! [♪♪♪] [DONNA]: IT WAS JUST OVER A YEAR AGO THAT WE STARTED WORKING ON THIS WITH CONGRESSMAN FROST, AND NOW AMBER ALERTS HAVE SPREAD ALL ACROSS TEXAS. COMMUNITIES FROM OTHER STATES ARE CALLING THE ARLINGTON POLICE DEPARTMENT AND RADIO STATION KRLD TO FIND OUT HOW THEY CAN PUT IT TOGETHER SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE AMBER ALERTS, TOO. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN GETTING AMBER ALERTS SET UP ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO, WHEN ATTORNEY GENERAL STOVALL INVITED ME TO COME TO HERE TO TALK TO Y'ALL ABOUT AMBER AND AMBER ALERT, IT TOOK ME ALL OF ONE SECOND TO SAY YES. EXCEPT SHE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT SHE'D BE SCHEDULING FOUR SCHOOLS IN THE SAME DAY, FOLLOWED BY A ROOM FULL OF STATE SENATORS AT THE CAPITOL, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME 'CAUSE MY HEAD'S SPINNING JUST A LITTLE BIT. UM... I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT THE STATISTICS ARE OVERWHELMING, BUT WHAT IS THE COST, IN HARD DOLLARS, BASED UPON IMPLEMENTING THE STATE-WIDE ALERT SYSTEM, AND HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT COST WITH THE STATISTICS? STATISTICS? HOW DO WE RECONCILE THE STATISTICS? YES. WELL... FIRST, I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEM. [VOICE BREAKING]: AMBER LOVED SCHOOL. HER FAVORITE SUBJECT WAS CREATIVE WRITING. HER TEACHER SAID SHE WAS A LITTLE PERFECTIONIST. HER FAVORITE FOOD WAS RICE-A-RONI AND SPAGHETTI. AND BLUE BELL VANILLA ICE CREAM. IT HAD TO BE BLUE BELL. [SNIFFLES] THE DAY THAT SHE WAS ABDUCTED, WE WERE SELLING GIRL SCOUT COOKIES, ME AND AMBER AND RICKY. [SNIFFLES] SHE WAS LAUGHING AND... SMILING, AND SHE WAS JUST SO HAPPY AND FULL OF LIFE. SHE WASN'T A STATISTIC TO ME, SENATOR. SHE WAS MY BABY. [SNIFFLES, SOBS] SHE WAS TAKEN AND MURDERED FOR NO REASON, AND NO ONE KNEW FOR HOURS OR HOURS, AND NO ONE COULD HELP US FIND HER. SO... I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN JUST SIT ON OUR HANDS AND DO NOTHING. I MEAN, THESE ARE CHILDREN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, NOT NUMBERS. YOUR CHILDREN... AND YOUR FRIENDS' CHILDREN. [SNIFFS] SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THEM SAFE, BECAUSE WE'RE RESPONSIBLE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN TAKE SIDES ON THIS. AND WE CAN'T DO NOTHING. IT'S TOO IMPORTANT. YOU WEREN'T WAITING TOO LONG, WERE YOU, SWEETIE? I'M SORRY I'M LATE. SO DID YOU HAVE FUN? YEP! AND DO YOU LIKE THE NEW PROGRAM? YEAH. YEAH? YEAH?YEAH. YEAH! WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR DINNER? UH... [MOCKINGLY]: "UH..." [GIGGLES] OKAY, YOU'RE IN, YOUR SEATBELT IS ON. [ENGINE STARTS] [♪♪♪] GOOD GIRL. GOOD GIRL! HI! HI! ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT FOR THE JUDGES? NO. OKAY. GOOD. VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT, NOW HOW DO WE FINISH? I HEARD HER SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CHIN-- HOW ARE YOU GOING TO-- PERFECT! LET'S DO IT AGAIN. YOU READY? [BOTH LAUGHING] WHAT WAS THAT? A SOMERSAULT. OH, WAS IT? [♪♪♪] WHY DON'T WE BOTH STAY HOME TOMORROW? I'LL MISS SCHOOL, AND YOU'LL MISS WORK. OH, I CAN'T DO THAT, SWEETHEART. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR ALL THE THINGS I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR. LIKE ME? YEAH, LIKE YOU, AND YOUR SISTER AND THIS HOUSE AND OUR CAR. WHEN YOU'RE A RESPONSIBLE GROWN-UP, YOU HAVE TO GO TO WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY, EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO. EVEN IF, MORE THAN ANYTHING, YOU WANT TO STAY HOME WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. MWAH! OH, NOW LOOK WHAT I DID. YOU HAVE TO WASH THAT OFF. LOOK AT THIS BIG HUGE RED LIPSTICK. MARCH. BACK IN. [BOTH GIGGLING] [♪♪♪] I'M MAKING A NOTE THAT THIS MONEY... IS FOR... AN MP3 PLAYER. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. [♪♪♪] "IT WOULD BE SOMETHING, INDEED," SAID DR. TEDDY BEAR. "BUT I DIDN'T DO IT. BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT--" [♪♪♪] NICHOLE. NICHOLE, NICHOLE, WAKE UP. NICHOLE.

THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO? YES, SIR. DID THEY EVER CATCH THE GUY? NO. THEY NEVER DID. WELL, AS IMPOSSIBLE AS THIS IS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND-- I MEAN, THE LOSS YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH AND THE PAIN YOU'VE HAD TO ENDURE, YOU HAVE FOUND A WAY TO KEEP GOING, A WAY TO KEEP YOUR DAUGHTER ALIVE, AND A WAY FOR YOU AND AMBER TO SAVE OTHER CHILDREN. YES. THANKS. WITH THE HELP OF THE PUBLIC AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, RADIO AND TELEVISION STATIONS, POLICE DEPARTMENTS, AND THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE FROM THE NATIONAL CENTER OF MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SET UP AMBER ALERT SYSTEMS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NOW, FOR THOSE LISTENERS WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT FOR US? YES, SIR. AN AMBER ALERT IS AN S.O.S. BROADCAST IMMEDIATELY OVER A VERY WIDE AREA TO ALERT THE PUBLIC THAT A CHILD HAS BEEN ABDUCTED AND IS IN GREAT DANGER. AND IS IT WORKING? OH, YES. EVERY DAY, AND EVERY TIME IT SAVES ANOTHER CHILD, I THINK OF AMBER. I LOOK UP AND I SAY, "YOU DID IT AGAIN, BABY GIRL." EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY. [INHALES SHARPLY] UH... ARE A DOZEN STATES ENOUGH, THOUGH? NO, WE'RE ADDING NEW ONES ALL THE TIME, BECAUSE KIDS ARE TAKEN EVERY DAY IN EVERY STATE. WE'D LIKE THERE TO BE AMBER ALERT SYSTEMS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, FROM COAST TO COAST. NOW, CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE ONE YET? NOT YET. LINDA, IT'S 7:00, YOU'RE NOT EVEN UP YET. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME LATE. OKAY, JUST BE READY AND I'LL PICK YOU UP IN 20. NO, JUST BE READY. OKAY. [PHONE BEEPS] NICHOLE? [SIGHS] [TEDDY BEAR SQUEAKS] OH, GEEZ.

DON'T WORRY. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO HURT YOU. YOU'RE A DAUGHTER TO ME, NICHOLE. JUST LIKE MY DAUGHTER. BUT I SWEAR TO GOD... IF YOU DO ANYTHING, I... I'D...

I HEAR HIM IN THE BACK THERE. RIGHT. TELL HIM IT'S DONNA NORRIS NOW, IN CASE HE FORGOT. MM-HMM. HOLD ON A SEC, MAMA. HOLD ON. [TURNS UP VOLUME] THE AMBER ALERT CONTINUES TO BE A POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT, BROADCASTERS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. CALIFORNIA IS JOINING SOME 33 STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN PASSING INTO LAW A STATE-WIDE AMBER ALERT PLAN... [SHARON]: SHE'S AWAY IN COLLEGE. I HAVE TO TELL HER, I HAVE TO CALL HER. LET US CALL HER, ALL RIGHT? LET US DO THAT FOR YOU. DO YOU HAVE HER NUMBER IN THE HOUSE? YEAH, IT'S ON A... ON A DESK, IN THE KITCHEN, IT'S IN MY LITTLE PHONE BOOK.

I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO MAKE A LIST OF THOSE PEOPLE FOR ME. SHARON? WHAT? SHARON. I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR HELP. I NEED YOU TO BE HERE WITH ME IN THIS, ALL RIGHT? OKAY. NOW WHO'S MAD AT YOU? WHAT? WHO DO YOU THINK COULD'VE TAKEN HER? UM... TERRY? TELL ME. BOYFRIEND. UH, WE BROKE UP LAST MONTH. HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM, I SAID NO, AND HE GOT REALLY ANGRY. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THAT BEFORE.

WHEN WAS HE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE FOR THE PHILIPPINES? THIS MORNING! HE LEFT THIS MORNING. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL FIND HIM, AND THEN WE'LL KNOW. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE? A FRIEND, SOMEBODY FROM WORK, A RELATIVE, A BABY-SITTER? GLEN. GLEN WHO? PARK. GLEN PARK. HE USED TO WATCH NICHOLE FOR ME AFTER SCHOOL, UNTIL I GOT OFF OF WORK. I LET HIM GO, AND HE DID NOT HANDLE THAT VERY WELL AT ALL. HE JUST LIVES AROUND THE BLOCK. OKAY, THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S VERY GOOD. OKAY, NOW, SHARON, WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS JUST STAY RIGHT HERE FOR NOW. I'M GOING TO GET EVERYBODY GOING ON THIS, ALL RIGHT? [SOBBING] [SIGHING] SHARON. WHAT?
