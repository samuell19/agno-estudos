Plus two billion, which we lent to municipal facilities. The total that Russia owes the allies is: 14 billion, 720 million 398 thousand 649 francs. I don't calculate the interest for now. Yes!

But there are pretty ones among Russian girls. - As for me, they are too cold. - Aha. Corporal, one girl kissed me so that l am still shaking. - And she slipped a note into my pocket. - Five. Eh, I wish I would read in foreign language Now, give me your love letter. It is in your language. I wish I read our language - Cow. - Good letter.

Are you already with her '? Not yet. But I am sure. Well, then hurry up! Within one one week, you must prove to your Fekla that you are a nice boy.

Juv, you shouldn't have slept when they were reading the order! Everything is clearly stated therein. "To Russia for two Weeks for being on honorary guard." Wipe your ass with this order.

You wait, a Women tamer! Easy! I brought Michael! He knows Russian business well. Do you know what the bolsheviks means? But I can explain, what the bolsheviks stand for. It is a party, like your Sindicalists. But it's better. That's correct. Bolsheviks is a party for poor people. Then Why are we fighting against the bolsheviks'? Cause we had five revolutions. Let someone stand at the door. Come on. Tell me, is Fekla an aristocratic name'? Congratulations! A proletarian girl loves you. Easy! Are the owners expelled from Russia, miner? Yes. And the whole country belongs to workers? Yes, it does. And this city as well? No, this city is occupied by the Whites now. For the time being. But there are also bolsheviks. They are being hunted. A price tag of 10000 was placed on the head of a bolshevik. - Not bad! - Good money. - It will be enough for a long time. - L'd like to see a live bolshevik. At least to hold 10000 in my hands. That would have been enough for me for the rest of my life. Brave guy. Tell me, Michael, are there girls among bolsheviks'? - There are, there are. - Ah'? There are.

Mom is spying again. -She sneezes. Shame on you, mother! You'? Is Mr. Voronov here'? Mr. Voronov is not here. How long do you know Michel? - Who... - Voronov. - You're kidding! - Do you like him'? - Not at all. - You can open up to me, I am his friend. You are not a flower girl. And this folder with notes which you have is also for the sake of appearance. You are a member ofthe underground movement. Do you see how astute I am'? It is impossible to be a revolutionary without that. In a Jacobean club Danton also said that... "The person, who bears the title of French King, escaped". And I heard with amazement, that he wasn't still deprieved ofthe crown". That's excellent! Excellent? l have a very serious proposal to the underground organization.

Jenechka, Are you really going to the Cinema? Send this letter. L'll do that if I'm going there, Michel. And if l am not going'? You are going, Jenechka. You are going. Good bye, Aleksandra. Perhaps we'll never see each other again. Only for your sake, Michel. Only for your sake. -Good... -Bye... What are you doing? Are you mad'? You know that my life is confidential after all! And you come to me without permission. You may be shadowed. What did that fellow tell you'? Nothing special. He said he was a revolutionary. Okay. He was lying. Stupid fellow! And what else'? He said I was a member ofthe underground organization. He said that? The appartment is failed. Thank you! Of course, I don't know comrade Brodskey. So, I have a private affair for you. What sort of private affair can you have for me'? Go back, right now! I decided to break the allies command headquarters. What's happened'? I made a detailed plan ofthe headquarters. This is the generais office. This is his lavatory. L'll be able to penetrate there as a plumber. L'll put a land mine to the water tank. The General will come in the lavatory.

This is a map of South America, madam. Do you remember'? Corrida. Bulls, madam. Flamenko. Pampass. Cordeliers, madam! Southern America, madam. It is a very, very rich country. It is all filled up with volcanoes, crocodiles, Indians and lianas, madam. There is the Amazon river. But here are predators-lions, tigers, hyenas. And palms are smelling sweet here. Palms, madam. Palms, madam. Please give me my son back! You stole my son. I don't understand, madam. The Gipsy were stealing our children before, but now the communists do. You enticed Jenia with resounding Words, he followed you. -Like a child after gipsy violin. Sanka! Suitcase! - What for '? Get off quickly! Why do you need children from the different class? Workers are prolific. I had the only son and you stole him. Where does she take the boxes? What's going on'? Jenia is not a thing, madam, which can be stolen. - Yes, he is a thing. - No, he's not a thing. - I tell you: he is a thing. - But I tell you that he is not a thing. It was me, who made him.

This is good money. - And that is a good guy! You have the Wares, madam, after all! - Okay, 250. - I laugh at you, madam. A price tag of some thousands rubles was fixed on my head. Thus, does this mean that a boy from a decent bourgeois family is cheaper? Than a ragamuffin-bolshevik'? - 10000 and not a kopeck less! - What for'? Feel sorry for the poor mother. You are not a mother, madam. You are a monster. Your mother love extends no further than 250 rubles. -300. - Okay. You don't want it friendly'? - No. - You don't want'? - No. Help! Raping! Robbery! Fire! Back! Into the wardrobe, madam! Michel, Michel, Michel, open please! Michel, beware. You don't know what is a deceived woman. Hey, are you still here'? Sit to the car, right now! Michel, I have carried out your assignment, I delivered the letter. You poke your nose too deeply into other people's affairs. - I am simply interested in revolution. - Your curiousity is suspicious. Don't dare to pester Sanka with obscene conversations. This is not a girl from mummy's saloon, is it clear'? She is not a small girl, and l am already not a child. I see that you are a completely perfect son of a bitch. Stop that. Let's go! Michel, I loved you. Take care-l am dangerous! - Kolka! Lackey! Spineless creature! Lackey! - Open, Jenechka! Help!

The bolsheviks wanted to dump us into the Black sea Hush! And we will dump them into the White one. Very pretty, nevertheless they are very pretty. - Yes. Who'? - What?

What are you talking about! This is the imagination ofthe average person. The counterespionage is a clean, comfortable room... In which an intelligent person in White dressing gown is sitting.

What is left is a bullet through the forehead. And don't you know Evgeney Brodskey'? I am a vallain, Colonel. We would have paid two times more for him. - Hello. - Hi, guys. We have them.

The officer is the officer. Here is the officer. Look at him closely. Chicken neck. Under the snow White uniform is a dirty body Some small thoughts about women. He eats when he is hungry. And scratches himself if it itches him. He will end his dirty life. And he will be driven into the ground, like everybody. You, for some reason, make a divine creature out of him. You serve him like dogs, or like the bolt of a rifle. He is setting you and us against each other. And he is making money from that fratricidal dump. As well as ranks, awards. _ Right'? 'RQW-Shut up! You see: right. Please sorry, it seems, I delayed you. Good bye. -Seize!-Whom should I seize? -Him!- Yes sir! - Fire! - Yes sir! I order! Aim above the head. - And how else Fire! Follow me.

Is this very important for our revolution'? - Very, but it... - Exactly!. Evgeney is a hero, one can say, and you... You were calling him a lier just because, his mum belongs to the bourgeois class. And he broke off from her. Well, Why am I telling you all these? You don't have heart. That is it. Only dryness in the soul. It is not possible to tell you a word. You do not want to hear any proposals I cannot live without revolution, here is Where it is in me. And for you it is just the same as civil service. The only interest is foreign clothes. That you are changing all the time. No more will l pester you. It is important for me to reach comrade Brodskey. That's it. Turn back. Sanka. Crazy The allies are already two months here.

Song: "The thunder has thundered -isolation is going on The provincial investigation is sending out telegrams That the whole district is filled up with thieves, That the critical moment has set-in. And the dark element is oppressing. Not that correlation of forces-the managers lament," Aha. And more slowly? "In all hide outs people are drinking not Wines, but poisons, In all the town murders and round-ups, They are ordering people to stake everything. And apply the reserve variant!" So. I don't like this. "And in response they are advised with Ieg" For me also. Gaston is missing. Celestine and Juv did not come. - "Respect that drama at least a little" -We need to disappear. Only one by one. - You are the first. - "Four from the side-your people are not here! Do not argue with us!" Let the police go, he is going his normal duty round, The situation is not appropriate and the trick Won't work!" - Now you, Sania. - No, you! It is more important that you remain free. As a disciplinary measure, I order you to leave without arguments. Go, Sania, go. Bravo! Bravo! -Go back! Round-up! Mama, I have dollars. Be quiet! Everyone should remain Where he is. We are talking about arresting a few state criminals. There will be commotion. - Yes'? - Yeah! Dear Artists I implore you to continue. Music! Your documents! Clean work. I beg your pardon!

Commissioner's ugly face! We shall still talk with you. Well, Why are you standing? Run away! And what about you'? Red bellied swine! Run, Sania! And you Why are you standing, blockhead'? Run for the girl. Sanka is in the car! -That Way to him, do itl. Michel, stand firm! Eh, Come here quickly. I am not involved, gentlemen. Michel, run. - Beat communists. Save Russia! Ah, what a man.

The chemists is closed. See the attendant. Open it please, or I throw a bomb! This is illegal! I protest, madam. What is this? The chemisfs is closed, madam, I told you that.

I will come back for you. Eh, old man. You remember what I said. No problem What a young girl. Why do you need all these? These bolsheviks hid here, they are in the chemist shop. Sometime ago, our work was the most peaceful. Fish oil. Castor oil. People were dying moderately. I ask you: Where have old good sicknesses all gone to'? Where is sciatica? Where is haemorrhoids'? I see only wounds. Pricked, out, fragmented wounds. It is already three years as I have not seen the analysis of urine. People stopped being interested in their urines. They are interested in politics. Nothing good will come offthat. The chemisfs is closed. Please go. I can show will power! Old man! We need cocaine! - Where is your prescription? - Lady, please. I have understood everything. Oh, gentlemen, this place is out of bounds! The Chemist's is closed. Closed. Eh, chemist, give me some opium. I have diarrhoea. Oh! Finally I can see someone with a decent illness. Take your opium. 4 pills more. Have you gone mad'? Such a dose can kill an elephant. It is either you will give them to me now. Or l will teach you such a lesson! And now, now I already see. You have a prescription. Here you are. Oh, what are you doing'? Don't disturb me old man. I have sentenced myself.

O.K. - Please. - What is this? - This is Curare. - Cu... Will curare take me'? Well, what are we talking about? - How does it work? - Firstly the lowerjaw will drop. Then, the eyes will drop. And a magnificent violet foam will come out from the mouth. It is enough! I don't want torture. Solomon. Give me an easy death. As easy as the kiss of a sister. Then I advise you to take good herring dish with onions. You are a fool, Solomon. And yourjokes are foolish. Without pain. Without smell. Without taste. Yes, really without odour. No, this is similar to a chemical experiment. - I'II hang myself! - Yeah! Hang. Trickster! I'll hang myself! Jenka, stop talking. Stop thee-and-thouing me please. - Arrogant man! - Ha-ha! - Napoleon! - Hi-hi! Everyone wants to become a Napoleon. It is impossible to Walk along the streets without meeting Napoleons. Let me tell you secretly. I am not against becoming a Napoleon myself. Between us. I have more chance of achieving this than you, than anyone else. I am offering you to become my Murat. What? Also not bad. Iam not going to rob my mum. You are not going. But she has already robbed you. While you were subtly worrying about Whether to report on her or not.
