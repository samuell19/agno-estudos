(Nippon Television 60th Anniversary Special Film) I'm Gon! I'm 12 years old! I wanted to become a Hunter so I can find my father, Ging. I took the Hunter Exam and made some great friends along the way! I'm Killua. I'm 12, just like Gon. I'm a member of the Zoldycks, a family of assassins. Would you say that I'm your friend, Gon? We're friends, of course! (Gon and Killua's Huncyclopedia) Next is Kurapika. His goal is to capture the Phantom Troupe, who massacred his Kurta Clan, and taking back the Scarlet Eyes they stole. But the Phantom Troupe is made up of incredibly strong Nen users. Capturing them won't be easy. Then, this guy's Leorio. We thought he became a Hunter just to get rich, but his dream is actually to become a doctor and care for the poor. These three are my friends. Now I'll introduce one more person. This is Hisoka. He's a strong, creepy magician we met during the Hunter Exam! And he knows my big brother, Illumi, too. He's a really mysterious guy. Hisoka lives for fighting strong people, so to fight Chrollo, the leader of the Phantom Troupe, he replaced the #4 of the Troupe and became a member. Scary! All right, Hunter x Hunter the Movie... ...is starting now! Hey, over here! - Come here! - Hey! What are you thinking about? Brother... How long have you been there? From the very beginning, as usual. I'm always watching you. Especially when my adorable little brother is on an important mission. I can do this on my own. That won't do. As your big brother, it's my duty to mold you into the perfect assassin. His ride is coming. Expose your bloodlust only at the moment you kill. Until then, imagine yourself as nothing but an object. Okay. Are you scared? Not really. That's what I expect from a fellow Zoldyck. Hey, get that ball for us! Just so you know, you do not need any friends. You'll only end up getting betrayed by them. And even if your friends don't betray you, you will be the one betraying them. Then, one day... ...you will kill them. Just like this. S-stop! Stop! Sir, is something wrong? Oh, no. It's nothing. It would take some more time until we arrive at Shanha City. Please sit back and feel free to take a nap. Oh, okay. Thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'll never betray Gon. (Hunter x Hunter: Phantom Rouge) Killua, is something wrong? Huh? What do you mean? You were staring at my face, aren't you? I wasn't. - You're lying! - I'm not. You're being suspicious here. Oh come on, I said I didn't stare at you! Gentlemen, please. Some passengers are still asleep, so please talk quietly. Right, okay, we'll be careful. Thank you for your cooperation. You were snoring. Huh? I was snoring? You, on the other hand, were grinding your teeth. I was?! You're lying! You are the one who's lying. Wh-what?! I mean, you lied to me first! Shut up! You were the one who started talking about stupid stuff! It's not stupid, it's true! I told you, I wasn't looking at you! Gentlemen! Please sit down! - O-okay. - Sorry. We're finally here! Hey! Gon, Killua! Leorio! 'Sup? Huh? A survivor of the Kurta Clan? Yeah, somebody saw one in this town. But wasn't the Kurta Clan... ...wiped out by the Phantom Troupe five years ago? Yeah, there's a high chance of this being just a rumor, but I told Kurapika just in case, and he wanted to look into it. So I tagged along. - Why? - What do you mean, why? He can get pretty crazy when it comes to the Kurta Clan. So a level-headed person like me needs to be with him. You sure care a lot about your friend. H-hey, don't say that. I-it's embarrassing. So, what happened? You see... We went and looked around but couldn't find anything. When we gave up and headed back to the inn, we met a boy whom Kurapika seemed to know. Are you...?! Huh? That voice... Kurapika? Pairo... You're alive? Kurapika? Is that you, Kurapika? Come closer. I want to have a good look at your face. Pairo... My eyes only reflect darkness. I tried my best to help, but he ended up getting his eyes stolen. Then what happened to Kurapika? I gave him some first aid. Right now, he's at the hospital up on the hill. Kurapika! For now, his life's not in danger. But he hasn't woken up. Why not? Who knows? Kurapika... Leorio, Kurapika moved! What? Kurapika, are you awake? Kurapika! - Is that you, Gon? - Yeah. Kurapika. Thank goodness. Sorry I made you all worry. Leorio, what happened to me after all that? You've been unconscious since then. It's been three days since then. I see. Don't push yourself now! You don't have any broken bones, but some of them are cracked. You took quite the beating. But I have to go now, or... You won't find that Pairo guy anyway. It was a ploy to steal your eye all along. I refuse to believe that was the real Pairo. Kurapika... No, perhaps Pairo did escape that tragedy and... No! If Pairo was your friend, he wouldn't have done all this to you! You're right... I too want to think of it that way. Hey. Could you tell us more about Pairo? He's a member of the Kurta Clan like you, right? Pairo was an irreplaceable friend. We shared the same dream. The same dream? All I knew of the world back then were the 128 members of my clan and the beautiful forest surrounding our village. But that was only until I read that book... A girl named Sheila gave it to us after we saved her in the forest. It was about the perilous adventures of a main character who worked as a Hunter. With a dictionary in hand, we became absorbed in its story and began to dream of the outside world. But to actually go outside, we needed to take an exam. After passing the language and common knowledge exams, I challenged myself to the final exam, but... The final exam tests your self-control. We'll send you to shop in a neighboring town. A neighboring town? Do you mean we'll get to go outside? Only as a part of the exam. You'll have 24 hours to return from shopping safely without triggering your Scarlet Eyes. However, you'll be going with a partner who'll share responsibility with you. Choose one carefully. Huh? A partner? Uh... I'll take Pairo. Huh? Do you understand the mission? You'll be buying supplies for the clan in bulk, so there'll be heavy lifting involved. Pairo can't even see well, he'll... Even so, I'm taking Pairo. If I can go with him, I'll have no regrets no matter what happens. Suit yourself... Awesome! Pairo, we're going together! Huh? Are you sure you want to take me? Of course. It has to be you. Okay. Then you two will have to put in these eye drops. Should your eyes turn scarlet within the next 24 hours even once, they'll stay that way until the drops wear off, even if you manage to calm down. If your Scarlet Eyes do activate midway, stop shopping and come back immediately, okay? All right, now take these eye drops. Okay. Oh! Pairo, let me do it. It's okay. I can find them by myself. As your partner, I'll carry my own weight. Oh, found them. Watch where you're going, you brat! Oh man, you got his clothes dirty! Pairo! Are you okay? Are you hurt? I'm okay. I just tripped. Hey, you with that kid? Look at this! He ruined my expensive suit with that wine! What're you gonna do about this? You liar! I saw it. You're the one who... Whoa, whoa, whoa. You might want to be careful with what you're saying. So, wanna repeat that again? No, Well... I'm sorry! It was my fault. I don't need an apology. Gimme money. - What?! - Wait! Um, if you need money... This is all we have. That's... That's the money Pairo's been saving up little by little! Hey, what the hell is this? They're just a bunch of one Jenny coins. This chump change is barely worth anything! You bastards... Kurapika, don't! Let's apologize and hope they'll forgive us! I'm so sorry. Please, forgive me. Sorry. Forgive me. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Please forgive me. - Let them go already! - They're just kids! Shut it! You got a problem with it? Here, Pairo. Thanks, Kurapika. Must suck to be you. You've gotta take care of that trash and all. You're losing out on what's fun in life because of him! Damn right. Huh? D-damn you... Stand up. Stand up! I said stand up! Stand up! F-forgive me! - Don't do this, Kurapika! - Let me go, Pairo! That's enough! Stop! Please, forgive us! We were doing it just because we were asked to! What?! What do you mean? Y-yesterday, a strange old guy asked us to try and make you angry. Huh? Did he have pointy hair? T-that's right! That's the Elder! And the stuff about Pairo? Did he tell you to mention Pairo's condition too? N-no, we didn't do it on purpose... Sorry, please forgive us. That's not gonna cut it! Kurapika! M-miss... He's a red-eyed monster! What's up with the color of his eyes? I've never seen eyes like that! - Are they servants of the Devil? - R-really? Get out! Get out of here! Red-eyed devil! - Get out of this town! - Get out! - Get out of our town! - Get out! I guess we're just not fit to go to the outside world. Huh? That's not true. I mean, my eyes turned scarlet. Kurapika, look! Huh? They're back to normal! Huh? What's that? I switched the Elder's eye drops with these. Back then, I pretended to drop them and swapped it. Oh, back there! Then I... You pass! After passing the exam, I departed on a journey to the outside world in search of a doctor who could cure Pairo's eyes. Six weeks after that,... ...the massacre of the Kurta Clan was in the news. Massacre? All 128 villagers were killed, and next to the scene of the carnage, there was a message, presumably left by the bandits. "We'll accept anything you leave, but don't ever take anything away from us." And that was the Phantom Troupe, huh? Kurapika... - I see something. - What?! Your beauty turns me on so much. It makes me queasy enough to throw up. I'm being carried up some stairs. Kurapika! What do you see now? The setting sun! The setting sun? That means he can't be too far away. Tell me more details. We might be able to locate him. Right... A mountain ridge on the horizon... There's a strange rocky mountain. It has a circular hole in it. Anything else? A river! I see a river to the right. Wait. Someone showed up. - What?! - Is he the culprit? How does he look? He has lip piercings. He's wearing a black robe, like a priest. Come now, it's time to sleep. There's a spider tattoo on his palm! A spider tattoo? I can't see anymore. A spider tattoo is the mark of the Phantom Troupe, isn't it? Surprisingly, his number was four, just like Hisoka. Why would there be two #4's? That must mean a new #4 joined in Hisoka's place. Hang on, guys. Let's focus on getting Kurapika's eyes back first. We should find out where we can get this view and pin down his location! What the hell is this? Heck, the drawing's so bad I can't even tell what's what. Yeah. But that's not a problem! The Hunters' information website should be perfect for times like this! Yeah, that's the right action to take. Oh, come on! The search results are coming up. There are too many that fit the category. We need to narrow it down a little. Why don't you just try places that are within ten minutes from here? I'll try that. The Totoria district, huh? Is that man's hideout somewhere in there? Yeah, but the range's still a bit broad. We'll have to check the spots one by one. - This many should be doable. - Yeah. As much as I'd like to go with you... Leorio, you stay here and watch over Kurapika. Yeah, you can leave that to me. - Killua, let's go right away! - Yeah! Wait, hey! You forgot your Hunter License! Hold on to it for me! Fine, I'll do it. All right, we're off. I'm counting on you! Call me if you find out anything! Okay! We'll find it for sure! Is this entire area the Totoria district? Yeah, checking each place one by one will take at least a couple of days. Let's hurry. I'll start with that town. Then I'll start from that side. So, where should we meet up? Do you see the clock tower right in the center of that town? Yeah. Why don't we meet there tonight at nine? Okay. Not here. Not here either. That's amazing! - Thanks. - You're welcome. Wh-whoa! S-stop! L-look out! Oh God! You okay? Oh, thanks! See you, mister! Man, I'm really sorry about that, guys. We're fine! I should give you a proper thank you. Thank you. My name's Retz. I'm a puppeteer. I'm Gon! Your performance was amazing! It looked just like the puppet was alive! Th-thanks. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. You've got an interesting name, Gon. - So do you, Retz. - Yeah? It's nice that both our names are easy to remember. Yeah, both our names are super short. Oh yeah, are you familiar with the area? Huh? Well, more or less. I'm looking for a certain place. Do you know this place? I think I'll regroup with Gon for today. Oh, Killua! How'd it go? - What about you? - I couldn't find it. I see. Neither could I. Oh, let me introduce him, Killua. This is Retz, a puppeteer. We met earlier today and became friends! Nice to meet you! Friends? Retz is amazing! His puppet moves like it's alive! Never mind that, we have an important task to do. Oh yeah, I asked Retz about that too. He had a few places that came to mind and helped me look around. We tried a bunch of places together, but we didn't have any luck today. - Really? - Yeah. But don't worry, he said he'll help me again tomorrow. U-umm, it was getting late, so I just thought we'd check out the rest tomorrow... You don't sound very dependable. Gon, why did you bring someone like this along? - Huh? - What do you mean?! He said he had "places that came to mind"? Sound suspicious. Maybe he's actually just a pickpocket or something. Killua! What's your problem? I'm helping Gon because he asked me to! I don't want to hear that from you! Apologize! Shut up! Retz! Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Killua, cut it out! Hey, are you... ...a girl? What?! A girl?! I wasn't trying to fool you or anything. It's dangerous for a girl to travel alone, so I usually pretend to be a boy. - I see. - That's nothing uncommon. Stop acting like a know-it-all. You didn't realize it at first either! Shut it! You two really get along well. I'm jealous. Not really. - Are you traveling by yourself, Retz? - Yeah. My big brother is also a puppeteer, and I want to follow in his footsteps once I've grown up, so I'm training by going around and performing in the streets. I guess you can call this guy my best friend. Did you make that doll yourself? Yeah, I did! Wow! That's amazing! I'm sure you'll become a great puppeteer! Thanks! That puppet has pretty eyes. - You guys do too. - Huh? Gon, your eyes are so clear and transparent. Killua, your eyes hold darkness but are still pure. Cut that out! You're giving me the creeps. - Hah, you're embarrassed! - I'm not! The eyes are the toughest part when making a doll. Whether the doll's dead or alive depends on them. Once given the best eyes, even dolls can become vessel for a soul. That's what people say, anyway. A soul? I knew it, she's... Killua. Is something wrong? It's nothing. All right, let's chow down and get a good night's sleep! Oh, this is good! Hey, that's mine! - It's mine now! - Oh, come on! Pairo... I'm going to find a doctor that can cure your eyes. Then we'll go out and see the world all we want. We'll always be together, Pairo. Forever and ever. Who's there? You're...! How wonderful. The smell of antiseptics mixed with your blood... Hisoka?! Bastard, why are you here?! Could you keep it down? Don't worry. Hisoka would've already killed me if he wanted to. Since he didn't, he's not here to kill me. Indeed. What brings you here? I thought I'd tell you about the guy who stole your eyes. What?! That guy is... U-Uvogin?! I thought Kurapika got rid of him! What's going on? Found you! I heard you were looking for the chain user's eyes! How come he knows that? Come on down! Yeah right, as if we'll ever do that! Uh-oh! Isn't that... We've gotta run! Hurry! Big Bang... Impact! - Are you okay, Retz? - Yeah. - Retz, run away. - But... There's no time to spare! Hurry! Okay! How come he's back? I don't know, but if he has something to do with Kurapika's eyes, - we've gotta fight him! - Yeah! I just can't get enough of this feeling. Let's have one hell of a fight! - First, test the opponent's ability! - First, test the opponent's ability! Boost aura on the arms for defense! Ren! Take this! H-he's so powerful! He's got more than just brute strength. Enough talk! That tickles. You little flies! He's coming! Rock Storm! Killua... Gon... We don't stand a chance against him. Don't fight opponents you can't defeat. Come on, there's got to be more than just that. First, we've got to do something about his punch! Run away. Killua, are you listening?! Y-yeah. Let's attack his right arm together! Got it. That should've smashed his bones! It's not working. I knew it, we can't win against him. I just can't get enough of fighting. Killua, you should run! All right, shall we finish this? Hurry! Die! You two. Why the hell are you getting overpowered by a mere puppet? - Nobunaga! - A puppet? My body is made of steel. Not even your sword can pierce my heart. Shut up. You're just a puppet. Thanks to that, I can indulge in the joy of fighting once again. And I've been ordered to kill anyone who gets in my way. Even if it's my former partner! I told you to shut up! Is that your En? Sorry, but that isn't going to work for me! What's wrong? Is dodging all you can do? You were stronger when you were working with me! Big Bang... You always let your guard down when you do that. Impac... Without Uvo's eyes, your power's nothing to me. This is good. To die by your sword is grea... I said shut up. Way to screw with us when you're just an ex-Troupe member! I know you're there, Omokage! - Omo... - ...kage? His name is Omokage. Omokage? I told you, haven't I? A couple of years ago, I replaced the #4 of the Phantom Troupe. Yeah. That's him. He's the guy who stole your eyes. A self-proclaimed "Divine Puppeteer," he's a Nen user of the Specialist type. He slips into people's hearts and creates puppets from their deepest attachments and obsessions. Puppets? These puppets become slaves that obey every single one of Omokage's orders. However, even when they're under Omokage's control, they still retain the original's memories. The original's memories? The puppets are made with a copy of a person's heart. As such, the puppet may have to go against its own will to obey Omokage's orders. He loves watching such tragedies unfold. So that Omokage guy sent a puppet of Pairo to steal Kurapika's eyes? Probably. He's a collector, after all. He dragged my best friend for such a stupid thing? The Omokage I defeated to join the Troupe was a puppet of himself. If you knew that, why did you... ...let him go without killing him, you ask? You want to know why? It'd be a waste to kill him off when I could get so much fun out of him. Still as disgusting as ever, aren't you? Why are you telling all that to us? Just like Gon, you're my unripe fruit. I won't let others pick you before you're ripened. Can you not say things as creepy as that? Be careful. Omokage is a dangerous man. Bastard... You've got some nerve to show up in front of me. I went and revived Uvo. It's unfortunate you feel that way. I was expecting a word of thanks. How dare you! Your rage is proof that you're alive. However, it's not eternal. The Shadow Beasts, huh? Bastard, he even made a puppet of Paku! Are you the one who stole Kurapika's eyes? Then give Kurapika's eyes back! Gon! One day, your eyes will also be a part of my collection. Do enjoy what little life you have left. Wait! You'll be fighting us! We've been ordered to steal your eyes. Nen threads! I didn't ask for your help! Rest in peace. What's that? That bastard Omokage dug out Uvo's body and stole his eyes. And he even made a copy of Paku. It's not over yet. - Let's go. - Yeah. Looks like you guys are also after Omokage, but try not to get in our way too much. The spider cleans up after its own mess. Found it! Thank goodness. He's not broken. - That's great, Retz. - Yeah. Gon. Let's get going. Huh? O-okay. But we need to find some clothes for Retz first. Wonderful! My special Heaven's Angels outfit is complete! So beautiful! - Huh? - Wow... Ah, you look very, very excellent! Haven't had such a nice material that ignited my spirit in a while. You look wonderful, mademoiselle. You look just like a doll. Is something wrong? Oh, uh, nothing. Very well then, enjoy! I like it. It looks great on you. This is kind of embarrassing. I've never dressed like this before. I couldn't care less about that. Just hurry up and tell me where those places "you had in mind" already. You're so annoying. I'm about to take you there! You'll get into danger again if you come along, so just tell us where it is! - I'll be fine. - You might even die! They'll hold you like this and strangle you and... That's still better than not getting anywhere. What? I'm not living up to the fullest in my daily life. I've always wondered when I'll get to live for real. What are you talking about? You're not "living for real"? When I'm with you two, I feel like I'll get somewhere. Like you'll... ...get somewhere? Gon, can we talk? Sorry. We'll be right back. Soul Doll. What's up, Killua? I still can't trust her. I see. But you know... What do you mean, but? I get the feeling that there's something inside Retz's heart. So I wanna wait and see a little longer. You'll just end up getting betrayed. You will betray your friends. I won't betray them! Killua! Please. Will you let me help? You're both doing this to get your friend's eyes back, right? I want to help you two. As your friend. As a friend... Please! I'll leave right after we get there. You're fine with that, right? Killua, it's not like we have other clues. Let's have her help. Fine. Okay, Retz, lead the way. Okay! Huh? Retz, where's your doll? Oh, I asked the shop owner to hold on to it so that it's safe. Let's go. This way. Right over there. I see. That place does look fishy. Yeah. The view from here also matches what Kurapika saw. Yeah. Thanks, Retz. You can go back now. What? I already came here, I'll accompany you all the way! No. To be honest, you'll drag us down. What?! I helped you get here! Retz. He didn't mean for it to sound that way. There's a chance you might get hurt, and we don't want that. Okay? Fine. This is kinda nice. I... I always pretend to be a boy, so this is the first time anyone's ever been this kind to me. Gon. What are you doing? Let's go! Okay! All right, Retz. We're off! Be careful, Gon! Oh, and you too, Killua! What Kurapika saw was from the floor above, wasn't it? Yeah. We should look for a staircase. Wh-who's there? You're... Brother! Why is my big brother here? Killua, calm down! That's just a puppet! I know... But... Kil, why didn't you follow my advice? Why did you ignore my advice and made a friend? I told you so many times, Kil. Any friend you make will eventually betray you. Or did you make friends to betray them yourself? - N-no! - Killua! That's enough. I'll stop having expectations of you. My eyes will no longer be watching you. After all, my eyes reflect nothing but darkness. That's why I was told to take your eyes. As if I'd let you! What?! K-Kil... You can't defy me. I've told you so, so many times. Do not fight enemies you can't defeat. Killua, pull yourself together! You're in the way. Damn it! Kil, I will say this one more time. You cannot defy me. Do not fight enemies you cannot defeat. You do not need any friends. Any friend you make will eventually betray you. Then, one day... ...you will kill them. Damn it! And you'd run away again. But that is fine. Leaving behind your dear friend and running away is a horrible thing to do, but that's the correct choice. Shut up! Don't say another word! It's just like I told you. You have no right to make friends. You! I said, you're in the way. Gon! Are you all ri...?! How silly, Kil. You're bound to betray your friend anyway. T-that's not true! Then kill me. If you don't, I'll kill this kid. What?! I shouldn't be fooled. This is nothing more than a puppet! Gon! Come on, Kil. Hurry up and kill me. Hurry up and kill me. Kil! Come on. Hurry up. Kill me. Killua... No... I can't move... It's all right. That's good. You made the correct choice. Do not fight enemies you cannot defeat. K-Killua! Stop it! Soul Call! Gon! Not the ones I was ordered to take, but this isn't bad. Such strange eyes. Everything looks so bright. What am I doing? Gon! Hang in there, Gon! R-Retz! Right, Gon... At the very least, I need to get Gon's eyes back. G-give Gon's eyes back! I can't do that, Kil. I was told to bring these eyes. Don't give me tha...! Bye. Gon, hang in there! Gon! I-I'm all right, Retz. Retz... You'll just end up getting betrayed. I was the one who betrayed him! When Uvogin attacked us, and when my brother almost took my eyes, Gon always protected me, and yet... Yet I... It's just like my brother said! Killua, where are you going?! I have no right to be Gon's friend! Gon's Hunter License... That reminds me. I first met him at the Hunter Exam. I started talking to him just because he was my age, but he turned out to be as physically capable as me. He seems to be a laid-back kid, but he always sticks to his principles. He's the polar opposite of me. Before I knew it, he became an irreplaceable friend. And yet I... I betrayed him! I'm just the worst... I don't care anymore. Killua! Killua, are you all right? Gon... How did you find me? I followed your smell. The rain made that a little difficult, though. Why would you go that far for someone like me? What are you saying, Killua? I mean, I ditched you and ran away. No, you didn't. You tried to fight alongside me, right? But... Besides, if it's you, I don't mind getting betrayed. Huh? I'd still believe in you regardless. Gon, you... Fine, then. Where's Retz? I was focused on finding you, so I'm not sure. She's probably back with Omokage now. Huh? When I first met her, I somehow noticed one thing. I don't think Retz's eyes are her own. Then Retz's eyes originally belonged to... Omokage, probably. Only he could create a puppet of Illumi from your heart. Gon, you knew that much, but you still... No, there's still something I'm not sure about. But I did figure out where Omokage is. We'll get to Omokage if we follow his Nen in my eyes. Wait, is that why you let him take your eyes? Yeah! Why would you do something crazy like that?! You can say that again. Gon, you sure you're all right? Leorio! Kurapika! How did you get here? I used the GPS tracker in Gon's phone. Gon, you idiot. Why would you go that far? Don't worry about it. We're friends, right? I'm glad I have great friends like you. It's still too early to thank us. - Right, Gon? - Yeah. All right, guys. Follow me. Okay. It's time for the main show. - Right. - Yep! Let's go settle this! Yeah!! Beautiful. Everything certainly looks bright through these eyes. These eyes are quite wonderful. But unfortunately, Retz, these eyes don't fit you. Still, they're a great addition to my collection. Brother, you should stop doing this. Retz, what's wrong? I did all this for you. But I never asked for such a thing. It's only thanks to you that I became the Divine Puppeteer. Human eyes are necessary to make a doll come alive. You understand, don't you? I could perfect this technique because you became my first sacrifice. Back then I hadn't quite perfected the process, so your eyes were lost. I feel really sorry for that. Retz... That's why I revived you as a doll and started looking for eyes that fit you. I don't need any. Give Gon his eyes back. You got attached to him, huh? That's no surprise. You did spend time with those two by your own will, aside from a couple of orders. We have visitors. I'm taking my eyes back. Soul Call. He's here. There's no mistaking it. Taking your eyes back from Omokage will be very tough. What should we do? Gon and Kurapika can't see. Is it up to just the two of us? Don't worry. I'll use Nen if I need to fight. Yeah. And since he is dangerous, all of us need to work together if we want to win. Knew you'd say that. All right. Let's go! Yeah!! I don't sense anyone here. Welcome to my mansion of dolls! He also uses Zetsu! So you're Omokage? Answer me! Were you one of the Spiders when they attacked the Kurta Clan? Pairo can tell you about that. Omokage, I'm asking you! It was wonderful. I still remember it quite well. They treated us so warmly. Just as warm... ...as their fresh blood! You bastard! Do you have any other Scarlet Eyes besides mine? Unfortunately, yours are all I have. However, those now belong to Pairo. Look! Pairo's delicate body with Kurapika's passionate eyes. And also, Illumi's insanity with Gon's honest eyes. Two types of beauty that are opposite in nature can only coexist... ...within dolls. You scum! Is Retz here too? She is my precious little sister who sparked my love of dolls. Little sister? Or rather, she's now my creation, a work of the Divine Puppeteer. My living doll. Retz! If you pity Retz, give her more eyes. That's not gonna make Retz happy! Even though she's obtained eternal life? If she can only live as your toy companion, it doesn't count as being alive! Same goes for Pairo! How about you give Kurapika and Gon their eyes back right now, old man? Don't get the wrong idea. The reason I gave you hints to bring you here is not to return your eyes but to take them. Killua! Leorio! I'm also taking your eyes! All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. Now, my dolls, awaken! Show me a great performance! - They're coming. - I know. Killua, we won't lose this time! Yeah! It's great to see you made new friends. I thought I was your only friend, Kurapika. You're not Pairo! The real Pairo is dead. Yes, but here I am, alive, controlled by a strong will that I can't defy. I have to take your friends' eyes. I won't let you! Of course you wouldn't. But you see, I was ordered to kill everyone in my way. Even if I don't want to. Leorio! Is it okay if I live as Pairo? You're just a puppet created from my memories! But I remember it all. The Elder, even your parents. Even if you die, I'll make sure you come back as a doll. Then we can live together. Just like back then. Damn you... K-Kurapika, pull yourself together! You can't get over the death of someone you love unless you accept it! That's how we got over the death of our comrades! Pairo might've been your best friend, but right now you have us! Live in the present, Kurapika! Don't get in our way. What are you... Leorio! We'll be together, right, Kurapika? Forever and ever. And ever. Apologies, Leorio. I won't hesitate anymore. He's coming. Gon! Are you all right, Gon? Kil, do you still not understand? You're just a passionless puppet of darkness. That's not true! Killua's not a puppet of darkness! Gon! You can only feel joy after you've killed someone. No! You don't know a thing about Killua! Even if you make friends, you'll get an urge to kill them. You are a killer by nature, after all. Killua's not a killer. He's my best friend! Gon... We can fight him! We can win if we fight together! Yeah! I'm going to believe in Gon! Haven't I taught you not to fight enemies you cannot defeat? Let's go, Killua! Yeah! Gon! We did it! Yeah! Kurapika... Did you enjoy the outside world? What's wrong? I've suffered through many sad and painful times. But I made friends with whom I could share them. I see. I'm glad for you. Pairo! Leorio, thanks. Don't mention it. Tragedy has a taste as sweet as honey. Grief is a testament to life. Only my puppets could make that blissful experience possible. Be grateful. You're not getting away now! Get down here! Do you want to know why I joined the Spiders? I wanted puppets of its members. I left once I was done creating the ones I desired. The Phantom Troupe... My favourite six. And also... Chrollo! You stand absolutely no chance against them! Oh no! Indoor Fish. Why are you having a hard time against puppets? Hisoka! Cutting off Omokage's Nen will be faster than destroying the dolls one by one. Trying to play an ally of justice, Hisoka? I shall add you to my collection as well. Omokage! I won't let you do that anymore! I don't remember asking your permission. You have no right to insult the deceased! I will avenge Pairo. You're making Retz sad too! Retz? Yeah! Retz is sad! Can't you tell? Silence! You know nothing. I don't care about your reasons. In the end, all of you will become part of my collection! You simply can't understand the beauty of my dolls! Emperor Time. Very well. I'll take you on. Doll Catcher! Now, shall we begin? Double Machine Gun! Then I'll have some fun myself with... ...you! Maybe fighting dolls can be fun if it's one against three. I can assimilate my puppets to use their Nen abilities! You... Chain Jail! I know that one. That's the Nen ability that brought down Uvogin. Let's go! Damn it! At this rate, we'll be toast! Kurapika's Chain Jail is our only shot at winning! But I can't approach him! Don't worry! Killua and I will do something! How? We'll concentrate both of our Nen on a single point and become a shield for Kurapika! - Gon! - Both of your Nen? If Killua's with me, I can do it! Yeah. If Gon's with me, I can do it! Yeah! Don't forget about me! Okay! Let's do it! Your knife is quite dangerous. Thanks for the fun. Now then, you're the only one left. Bungee Gum! Guess that's all a soulless doll can amount to. How disappointing. I'm done over here. Damn you, Hisoka! How dare you ruin my puppets?! - Let's go, Killua! - Yeah! Here it goes! Bring it! Fall and perish like rotten apples, you mere humans! Drown in your own lukewarm blood! Chain Jail! - We did it! - He's now in a state of Zetsu! I can only use this ability on the Spiders. But as you took part in the Kurta Clan massacre and still have your spider tattoo, I'll regard you as one of them. Do you think this is enough to restrain me? Shut up! Judgment Chain! I'll set out a condition. If you agree to it, I'll set you free. What if I don't? This chain will pierce your body and crush your heart. Why can't you understand the allure of my puppets? They have eternal life, and they can also hold your beautiful eyes forever. Isn't that wonderful? Pairo never wished for anything like that! You just forced your twisted desires upon him. Yeah! And you've been tormenting Retz out of pure selfishness! I've been tormenting Retz, you say? Retz never wanted anybody else's eyes! Silence! Silence, silence! That's enough, Omokage. The condition is that you never use your Nen abilities again! Meaning I won't be able to make any more dolls? Now it's all up to you to say yes or no. If I can't make dolls, I'm as good as dead. But don't think you've won. Even if I die, my dolls will live on. And they will kill you. My answer is simply, no! Then die! Killua! Kurapika, you shouldn't kill any more people. I'll be the only one with blood on my hands. Stop it. I don't want you to kill a man for me. This is all I know how to do. So let me do it. Retz! Retz... Why did you... I'm sure this is what I would've done if I were still alive. What are you saying, Retz? You have eternal life. No. Brother... You're not a Divine Puppeteer. Creating a perfect copy, down to the heart, ...may have been a mistake. You putrid, rotten humans shall die... Ripper Cyclotron! Even if that was just a puppet, it still leaves a bad taste. The real ones? The ones that will finish you off... ...will be us. We're not going to let stupid puppets steal our prey. I can kill you right now if you like. - Don't. - If you kill the chain user, the chain wrapped around the boss's heart will only get tighter. Phinks, you guys know about it too, right? It's frustrating, but we'll have to settle the score another day. That's not up to you! I'm not going to just let you go! - Kurapika! - He used too much Nen. I'll settle scores with you once the stuff with our boss is cleared up. We'll make sure your experience will be worse than hell itself. Remember that. Hisoka, the same goes for you. I'm honored. Kurapika, are you okay? Just a little tired. Retz! I will accompany my big brother, and fade into memory. Retz... Gon, Killua, thank you. I finally got to live for real, thanks to you two. For real? Retz! What the heck? I guess this is how it should be. Memories are something you should keep to yourself. Yeah. Live for real, huh? I wonder what that means. Living life her way, maybe? Like how your goal is to become a doctor, right? Or how I'll find the eyes of my brethren. Everything else is second to that. And I'll meet my dad! I'll... Wait, I got nothing! I want you by my side, Killua. I like it best when you're with me! Ugh, fine. For now, I'll stay with Gon. In time, my real life will begin. Please head to gate three for a flight to Yorknew City. Please head to gate six for a flight to Kakin. Gon, Killua, Leorio... Let me say this one more time. Thank you for all the help. What are you acting so distant for? We just did what we should. Just call us whenever you need help. We're friends, after all! Thanks. All right. See you again!!
