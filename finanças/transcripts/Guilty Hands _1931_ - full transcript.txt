You mean a man has a right to commit murder? Not legally of course. - You can't mean morally. My dear sir, we haven't morals anymore, just laws. A man isn't punished for committing a murder. We've put him in jail for is mistakes. Because he has been caught. Of course it is possible to commit a murder and not be caught. Yeah. I have read books about that. Detective stories. The perfect murder. The perfect alibi. I am not talking about books. It is possible to commit a murder and not be caught. I believe that under certain conditions murder is justifiable. Speaking as an expert? - Yeah. For ten years I was district attorney of New York. And in that time I sent over fifty men to the electric chair. Thank you. Now I have retired to private practice I've kept a hundred of them out of it. I guess I am old-fashioned. It seems all wrong to me. The bible says: "Thou shalt not commit murder". Well, the bible says "a life for a life" too, doesn't it? Well, doesn't it? - Yes. What I can't understand is you, a lawyer, advocating murder. Now my dear sir, I didn't say any such thing. No, no, no. I simply said that in certain cases murder was justifiable. And I voiced the belief that a clever man in such a case .. Could commit a murder so skilfully .. If you know what I mean. So brilliantly that he could get away with it. Mr Grant, what would you call a justifiable murder? A justifiable murder? - Yeah. Well. A justifiable murder is .. A murder that is justifiable. That's your answer. Well this is my station. It has been very interesting. - Thank you. I hope I'll see you again sometime. Thank you, Mr Grant. Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. Have a good day. Daddy, Daddy! Hey, wait a minute. Who is this beautiful woman I see? Is this .. Is this my daughter? - Yes. How are you, kid? Glad to see me? Don't be silly, Say, what are you doing here? Aunt Madge and I came down a week ago. I thought you were in East Hampton. Well now, I wrote you. Don't you ever read your mail? Oh, busy, busy, busy. Gee, I'm glad to see you. Glad to see you. - Carry your bags, sir? I guess you'll have to. There's nobody around. Give it to me. I'll take it from here. How did you know I was coming? - Mr Rich told me. Come on, hurry up. We've got ten miles of rough water ahead of us. Don't you just love it, father? Yes, it's heavenly. Just too precious. [ Door knocks ] Who is it? Mr Grant, sir. - Grant? Come in, come in. Hello, Rich. Drag up a chair, Willis. You are late. Well, if you will live in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. I know. Alright, Willis. I've heard the train was late too. What is it this time? - A lot of things. I want you to make a new will. Sit down. More ladies, huh? - The last of the ladies. I want you to attend to them. This one too? No, she is dead. She committed suicide, didn't she? - Nothing of the sort. She was leaning out of a window at my apartment. She slipped and fell. She was sixteen, wasn't she? That was the only time she fell. - I tell you it was an accident. Alright. It was an accident. Maisy Tevis. Five thousand dollars. Gertrude Smith. Passage to Europe and five thousand dollars? She has a promising voice. Did he live up the rest of her promises? Yeah. - Oh well. Helen Sprague. A polite note of goodbye. And kind regards to her mother. She lived with her mother, eh? - Why shouldn't she? She should. Marcella Day. What do you want to do with this one? Nothing. Louise Day. Five thousand dollars. That was another day, huh? Alight, alright. Just attend to them. Alright. How long does the doctor give you? Doctor? What doctor? Well, you said you wanted me to make you a new will. I thought you were dying. Aren't you? - Certainly not. I've ever felt better in my life. Strong as a bull. Strong as an ox, is the correct quotation. Not that it matters. What about this will? - I'll tell you more about it tomorrow. Is that all there is to this? - Nearly all. And you brought me all the way from New York just for that? Well, as a matter of fact Grant I am going to get married. Do you think that is a good thing to do? - Well, why not? I'm strong. I am only forty-five. Well, forty-seven. I've got all the money that anyone would need. Is there any reason why I shouldn't get married? There are fifteen reasons right there. Not counting Humpty Dumpty. - Humpty Dumpty? The girl that we can't put together again. Tell me. Who is the very lucky lady? Well that is one of the reasons I sent for you, Grant. It's your daughter. I don't think that is funny. - I'm serious. Your daughter and I are going to be married. You'd better play around with these, old man. Your daughter and I are going to be married. My daughter is not going to do anything of the sort. Why not? Well, I hate to get sentimental about it but .. I've been mother and father .. Aunt Mary and Grandma Smith and cousin Willy to that girl. And sometimes when I look at her. It seems as if my wife had come back. No, Rich. You can't have her. - How are you going to stop us? She wants to get married. We love each other. Oh, don't be silly. We are going to get married and nothing you can do or say will stop it. Not anything. She is of age. - I'll stop you. - How? You know, it's a funny thing. Only a few hours ago I was telling a couple of men .. That there were times when I thought murder was justified. Of course, I was talking from a .. Purely impersonal point of view. Now, here we are. Oh don't be heroic. - I don't mean to be heroic. You know, it is a very interesting thing, Rich. I never thought of this much before but .. You ought to have been killed years ago. You are no good you know. The world would be much better off without you. You mean that, don't you. - Oh, yes. Have you ever seen a man in the electric chair? I've sent dozens of them there. And I've kept dozens of them out of it too. I don't suppose there is anybody in the world .. That knows any more about murder than I do. I can kill you and nobody will know anything about it. Pah! Yes, I can. - I'd like to see you do it. Oh, you will be there but you won't see it. I am not afraid of you. I don't believe a word you've said. Not a single word. I am going to marry your daughter. I'll kill you before you can. I don't care how smart you are. I don't care how carefully you've planned it. You will get caught. You will pay for it. And if you get away from the police, I will get you. After you are dead? - After I am dead I will get you. I will come back after I am dead and I will get you. Alright old man. Meet you in hell. You've no right to say that. Well, I'll take the right. A month ago you were in love with me. - I wasn't. I liked you. I respected you but .. Now that isn't true. Look here Barbara, what's it all about anyway? I don't know, Tommy. Honestly I don't know. Why, he is old enough to be your father. What difference does that make if you love a person? But it isn't love. Barbara, don't you know what this man Rich is like? Don't you know what he is? Are you going to tell me that all over again? You've told me and told me and told me. I am sick of the sound of your voice. I am sorry, father. Why don't you pick on someone your own size you big bully. What's this, a new dress? Oh father, what a lover you would make. Why? Because I noticed your dress? I got to pay for it. What is she doing, son? Giving you a dressing down? No, sir. Why didn't you punch her in the nose? See, look here. I want to see you. Well, after dinner, father? - No. You come to my bungalow in about three minutes. You know. It's the same one I always have. Give me time to take a shower. Go on. He knows. Yes. I've got to go and talk to him. I'd rather be spanked. Well, I hope you are spanked. Tommy. I didn't mean what I said. I do love you. Well that is, sort of. But this other thing, it is .. it's different. I'm carried out of myself. I can't give him up. I hope he beats you. - You would. Want me to wait for you? - No thanks. See you again before dinner? - Maybe. Father. My dear. I won't look. Come in, come in, come in. Here. Have a cigarette. - Thanks. It works. Hey. Don't go through my pockets like that. Alright father, I won't. Nothing in them anyway except a lot of worthless old papers. Here, let me do that. Go on. Where did you get the idea you could tie a necktie? Somebody put that in a book about fifty years ago and .. Ever since that time all the women have wanted to tie a necktie. And there never was one of them that could. Look at it. How's that? Perfect. Well, how about giving the old man a little kiss? Help yourself. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Say, why didn't you tell me about you and Rich? You know, that's the first time in your life you ever kept anything from me. Well Gordon told me not to. He said he wanted to talk to you about it. Oh, I see. Sister. I'm not going to let you marry that man. Why? - What? Why can't I marry him? - Because you don't love him. I'm crazy about him. That's what I say. Now look here. You're a very beautiful woman. And you are a good woman. - Thank you, sir. Don't talk like a fool. Now darling, can't you see that I'm trying to do this thing decently? Yes, father. There is no doubt in your mind that I love you? Is there? You know I would do anything in the world for your happiness. Don't you? - Of course. We've got that far. You know Rich is old enough to be your father don't you? I don't care. - And he is no good. He is going to be good. All the rest of his life. Did you fall for that line of talk? Well, he is absolutely sincere. And after all, all men have pasts. You probably had a past yourself. That hasn't got anything to do with it. This man Rich is rotten clear through. Now look here, Babs. I'm not going to mince words. Rich isn't fit to marry any woman. He will just bring you shame and disaster. I tell you the thing is indecent. What are you laughing at? - You should just see yourself. Go and look in the mirror. Oh. How can anyone argue with their shirt-tails out. How you ever find anything in this grip is beyond me. I probably won't be able to find a thing by the time you get through with it. That reminds me, I must dress. Father is this plugged in? - I don't know. It looks like it. [ Music ] Stop that thing! Will you please take it off? - Alright, you old meanie. Yeah, that's better. Now. Tomorrow we'll go away from here and we'll forget all about this man Rich. And all about the whole episode. - No. Well then, I'll take you. I won't go. Now Barbara dear, what has got into you? I don't know, father. Honestly I don't know. Maybe you are right. I'm probably wrecking my entire life. And I can't help it. I don't want to help it. Barbara, this man you want to marry is a beast about women. I mean that literally. He is just like an animal. So that your wedding night, instead of being a thing of beauty that you will .. Remember all your life long with great happiness will be a horror and a shame. So that no matter what happens afterwards .. Even after he's gone and dead the memory of that time will stay with you. And spoil your life. It's a thing you can't live down. A horror you will never forget. I won't let it happen. That's not true. I don't believe you. Of course you don't. How could your mind even frame such a thought? But you believe it now, now that I've told you, don't you? No. I don't believe it. And nothing I can say to you will .. Make you change your mind? No matter how much I beg you? I'm afraid not. Alright. I won't say another word. Not another word. Yes I will. One word. You know I love you don't you? Yes, of course I know that. You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. Or cause you any unhappiness. Yes. Alright kid. Run along. Don't worry, father. Everything is going to be alright. Sure. Everything is going to be alright. We are all friends here. So I know that you will all rejoice with me. In the great happiness that has come into my life. I am about to be married. The loveliest girl in the world has consented to make me happy. At ten o'clock tomorrow morning. The daughter of my old friend here, will become my wife. To the bride. - Speech. Speech. Why, I .. I .. Oh father, won't you say something for me. Thank you, my dear. All the happiness. I am glad to have this chance to talk to you. I am not an old-fashioned father. I know the day of asking a parent's consent to his child's marriage is gone. I suppose I should be happy to even be told of my daughter's marriage. Well, I am happy. And I don't have to tell her that. My one thought in life is her happiness welfare and contentment. It is going to seem funny. To hear my old friend and client call me Papa. But I expect to get used to that. It is one of the penalties of my extreme age. But, my son. I want to assure you. That my one thought now and always is Barbara's happiness. You may remember that only this afternoon .. I told you to what lengths I would go to ensure that happiness. I am glad to tell you that again. Please do remember. All the hours of your life. There are no lengths to which I will not go to ensure my child's happiness. Now, you'll remember that my boy, won't you. All the rest of your life. And now everybody get up. I will drink a royal toast. Break your glasses. To my old friend Gordon Rich on his .. The eve of his wedding. All the happiness in the world. And a long, long life. I do love classical music. Do you know the peanut vendor? I positively have never met him. Aren't you witty. It's a song. Eleven o'clock. Oh is it? I hadn't realized. It doesn't seem possible. Goodnight, old man. Pleasant dreams. We must have a nice long talk. Yes, of course. Any time you say. There is the boat. You will excuse me. Your boat is here. I am sorry you can't all stay. There will be four or five boats at my dock at 8 o'clock in the morning. I hope you can all come back for the wedding. Now come on, kid. You and I will go in the garden and have a little love scene all by ourselves. Oh, you great big heathen. You are not going? Oh, the child is just going to take me to my bungalow. Well? That child. A mere child. - I know but I can't help it. I find myself lying awake at night thinking about her. I tell you I have got to marry her. - But why marry the girl? Can't you see it's the only thing I can do. How do you know? - Oh, don't be a fool. You think I don't know women? In her case it has got to be marriage. I see. Well, I .. I guess that's the end of us. Probably not. You've seen me before carried away by some girl. Not once but a great many times. - It's just that I .. But I have always come back to you. No, darling. Please. You are a peach, daddy. Miss Grant, would you like your wrap? - Yes, thank you. And you didn't mean what you said this afternoon did you. No, my dear child. Of course I didn't. I'm kind of weak-minded about you. And if marrying Rich tomorrow is going to make you happy, why hop to it, kid. Darn it. Kiss me and go to bed. And everything is going to be alright? Everything is going to be alright. Goodnight, darling. - Goodnight. Pleasant dreams. - The same to you. Alright, Come in. Shut that door. I want you to watch Mr Grant all night. - Yes, sir. All night. Understand? - Yes. When he goes to his bungalow, watch it. - Yes. If he leaves, come to me right away. - Yes, sir. If I'm asleep, wake me up and tell me if he leaves his bungalow. Understand? I certainly will. - Alright. That will do. Barbara? - Yes? Barbara, I want to see you. But I am not dressed, dear. Please come to the door, dear. I only want to say goodnight. Goodnight, dear. You are lovely. Lovely. No, no! Go. Alright, girly. I hope it don't rain. I wouldn't want to stand out here all night in the rain. I wonder if he is in there. Reckon I'd better go around the house and find out. What for? If he is there, there he is. And there he is. Yes, sir. That is just where he is. There. [ Gunshot! ] Darling. I want to see you. I want to talk to you. Oh, let me in. Please. I have to see you. Darling, it is Marjorie. That guy has got something on his mind. Just walking and walking. It's alright as long as him doing the walking. He looks kinda funny. Maybe he has got a pain or something. I'm going in there and asking him what is the matter. Is that your business? Man, I'll make it my business. I'm just going in there and asking him what's the matter. Has he got a pain or is he going to walk all night or what? And what do you think he will do to you? He's going to look you in your big black eye and say: boy, get out of here. That's what you think. I'm going to do it. Say that. - What you going to do? Get out. Right. I done warned you. Now, I'm telling you. What's the matter, boys? Jimmy here .. - He told me it was you. [ Female scream! ] What's that? Murder! I heard someone scream. What's the trouble? - Shush. There is nothing we can do. He's gone. - What's happened? Why, what's the matter? Gordon. Oh, Gordon! Oh, no. I heard a woman scream. Why doesn't somebody ..? - It's no use, Mr Grant. He is dead. You sure? - Positive. It's alright, dear. You had better take her away, son. I think all you ladies had better .. Yes, but what I want to know is .. - There's things we've all got to know. Suppose we meet downstairs? Willis, will you ask them all to meet us in the .. In the trophy room. - Yes, sir. Say, what are you going to do? I want to close those staring eyes. They are not staring at you. - It's not decent. Don't do that! You mustn't do anything until the Coroner comes. Oh. I see. No, Mr Hastings. Do you want your fingerprints all over the doorknob? Oh. I am sorry. Well, what did I tell you? Sorry. Please. My nerves. That's a brave girl. Well, suppose we all sit down. And who discovered the suicide? I did, sir. How did you discover .. - Just a minute, Miss West. How did you .. What were you doing? I wasn't doing anything. I was just sitting in my room. Thinking about things. I heard a woman scream. - So did I. Scream? Why, she yelled. Well, rather. She cried out it was murder. Yes. I heard that too. Go on. I hadn't even started to undress. I ran out into the hall. The door to the room was open. So I rushed over to that and saw Mr Rich lying on the floor. Where was the woman who screamed? I don't know. I didn't see anyone. Barbara, did you .. - No father. Miss West? Why, no. I heard the scream and came out as soon as I could. I see. Somebody screamed and Tommy came running out of his room and .. Saw Rich lying on the floor. Is that it? - Yes, sir. I see. Thank you. Well, after all none of these things are really very important. For some unknown reason. My old friend killed himself. Why do you say he killed himself? My dear young lady, you saw the pistol in his hand. The powder marks on his shirt front. Huh? The places where it was burned. You must know that he held the gun close against his own heart. I say he didn't kill himself! I say he was murdered. Now, Miss West. You knew Rich very well, didn't you? Do you suppose that he'd allow anyone to get close enough to him .. To put a gun against his heart and kill him? Do you suppose he'd do that and not put up a fight or make any kind of outcry? No, I do not. Did anyone here hear a cry? I asked if anyone heard an outcry. Did anyone hear the sounds of a quarrel? Well, I haven't been asleep at all. I heard no cries, no sound of any quarrel. In fact I didn't even hear a shot. [ Thunderclap ] That's why you didn't hear any shots. It's been thundering all evening. I'm afraid Miss West, you are wrong in your assertions. You all knew him. We've all been friends of his for years. I tell you he did not kill himself. - In spite of what we've seen? I don't care what we've seen. It was the last thing he would have done. Mr Scott .. you've known him for years. If you hadn't been here .. If someone telegraphed you that he'd committed suicide, what would you say? I wouldn't believe them. - Of course you wouldn't. And you, Mr Wilson. How long have you known Gordon? 20 years. And he was a cowardly sort of .. He was afraid of things, right? No. He was a fighter. Not afraid of anything. Always wanted his own way and always took it. Now, Mr Grant. Do you still say that he committed suicide? Well, we have to face facts. - Why should he kill himself? He was getting the woman he wanted wasn't he? Men don't kill themselves all the time like that. He was murdered. Why should anyone want to kill him? He had no enemies. We were all his friends here. This is monstrous. If this man killed himself. Let us behave with decency and kindness as to his memory. If he was killed, then we will find it out. I tell you the law doesn't let things like that happen. Lordy, Lordy, Lordy. Lordy. Excuse me, folks. Alright now, Jimmy. Keep your shirt on. What is it? The boss told me to come up and see him this evening. I goes in the room and .. bam! There he is lying dead on the floor. When did he tell you to come and see him? And he tells me to watch this gentlemen's bungalow. And he says. If this gentleman leaves the bungalow for me to come up and tell him. He says: Jimmy, no matter what time it is you come and tell me. I goes up there and nobody will never tell him no more. Father. Now that's alright. Jimmy, when did he tell you this? - About an hour, an hour and a half ago. He certainly did. And you say Mr Grant left the bungalow? Yes, sir. - I knew it. Jimmy, when did Mr Grant leave? Right after I heard you scream, Miss Marjorie. I ..? Why, I .. I didn't scream. It certainly sounded like you, Miss. Goodness knows, I've heard you often enough. I certainly did. Are you sure he asked you to watch Mr Grant all night? Yes, sir. Did he tell you why? - No, sir. Because he was afraid of him. Doesn't that prove it? Daddy, daddy. Why don't you say something? Sit down. It's perfectly alright. Sit down. You say Mr Rich told you to watch my bungalow? Yes, sir. What did you do? Me and Johnny, we goes to the bungalow and we stands around there and .. And stands around there and pretty soon we sees you come in. And you pulled down the shades. I suppose the next thing I did, I jumped out the back window? No, sir. You just .. Walks up and down, up and down. And you're sure it was I? Yes, sir. It was you alright. And then Johnny says. Maybe there is something wrong with him. We ought to and bust in there and see. So, in we bust and there you was. You're sure I never left the place? - No sir, you didn't. You were just walking up and down. - I see. Aright. Let's say Rich was murdered. There is my alibi. Where is yours? And yours? And yours. I was in my room. - I was taking a bath. I slipped and nearly broke my neck when that woman screamed. I was in bed. I was asleep. It woke me up. There you are, you see. All of you. He was murdered. I say he was murdered. Alright. I say Rich committed suicide. You say he was murdered. Aright. I wasn't in the house. All the rest of you were. You see Miss West where your absurd charges are leading us? Every one of you will leave this place under suspicion. No-one will leave this place. Mr Grant, you must do something about this. You've been a district attorney. You've defended murder cases. If anybody can find out who killed Rich, you are the man. Me? You want me to do this? - Who's better fitted than you, sir? Nobody. That's true. Nobody. But I want you to understand what this means. In the morning we will send for the police. I will pry into your hearts. I'll question you all exactly as if you were on trial. Now, to clear yourselves. Go on. Hunt and search and pry. Investigate. Bring me the murderer of Rich. Oh, what is he doing? Does it take him all this time to dress? It seems to me we've been here for hours. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting terribly nervous. Well, we thought you would never come. Yes, I notice that everybody seems a little bit nervous. Well these murder investigations are nervous things. I will admit that. Mr Grant, I can't see the reason for this delay. We've all been sitting here for hours. What have you found out? What have you done? Nothing. Not a thing. I've gone over the ground very carefully and mapped out a plan of action. Come on, Babs. I will take you first. - Yes, father. Father, sure you don't think that I .. Think? What do you think? What do you think I think? Well, I haven't got much to ask you dear. I think. What are you looking at me like that for? Well, I .. What is it? What's the matter with you? Oh Dad, there is something I must ask you. I'd rather die than say what I have got to say but .. But there is a cruel, wicked thought in my mind and I must know. Did you kill Gordon? Why do you ask that? Don you see, Dad? It was because of what you said tonight about him. And then at dinner when you were drinking his health. And those two men. You heard them say Gordon told them to watch you. Why did he ask them to do that? Why was he afraid of you? You heard Marjorie say he was killed. So you think I killed him, huh? No, no. Only .. - Now, my darling. Listen, Barbara. Look at me. Do you think I would let you go through all the rest of your life .. With the shameful knowledge that your father was a murderer? Do you seriously think that now? Come here, look at me. Now, I have never lied to you, have I? Huh? Never in my life. Now this is the truth. On my honor. Gordon Rich was entirely responsible for his own death. Dad! Why, Dad? Why did he do it then? I've been thinking that and wondering about it myself. See, I knew so many things about him. I knew his life so intimately. Do you really want to know why I think Rich killed himself? Yes, father. You wait here. I will be right back. Come here. You know about these? His women? This one he was sending Europe to have her voice cultivated. He gave five thousand dollars to that one. He gave five thousand to that one. He gave ten thousand to that one. He gave .. oh, what does it matter? Look here. This is the little 16-year old girl that jumped from a window on the 24th floor. She wanted to stay honest. Why are you telling me all these things? Because I think that is the reason he killed himself. I think he was afraid to face life with you and the memories .. Of this 16-year old child and the way her little body looked .. All crumpled up on the pavement where they found it 24 stories below. Don't, father. You know, I think I worried him. I think he killed himself to rid himself of the memory of those women. Don't you see? - And that's what I meant to him. That's all I meant to him. Just one of those. Of course, I wasn't going to marry him. What? You were so right. He was terrible. What happened? Only a few hours ago you though he was wonderful and marvellous. Well, I didn't understand. I didn't believe you. Well, what happened? I am ashamed to tell you. But I wasn't going to marry him. I was going to tell you that as soon as I saw you. Say that again. Why father, you look so funny. Say that again. I wasn't going to marry him. Why father, what are you laughing at? What is funny about it? That is something you will never know. Father! Well, it's just a little joke of my own. You wouldn't understand it. You wouldn't think it was funny. Run along and tell Mr Hastings I want to see him, will you. Hurry up, dear. Get Mr Hastings. You know him. Rich. Thank you. Just a few questions, Mr Hastings. Well Mr Grant, there is nothing I can tell you. Nothing at all. But there is one thing I think we ought to do. We are not showing any respect for that poor dead fellow upstairs. His eyes should be closed. And that ugly looking weapon taken out of his hand. Do you want to destroy the proof that Rich committed suicide? No. No, of course not. I hadn't thought of that. - Well think of it constantly. Do you still believe Mr Hastings that a murderer never escapes? I still believe this murderer will not escape. Oh, of course. Providing there is a murderer. Quite so. Mr Hastings. Who do you think discovered Rich's suicide? What woman screamed? I am not sure. - Who do you think it was? I don't like to accuse anyone unless I am certain. Oh, hang it, man. I am sorry. Excuse me, I didn't mean that. What I meant was that I can't do this thing all alone. I must have some help. Now, who screamed? Miss West, I think. But was it Miss West? Yes. - Thank you. You have no idea of the value of one little fact. One simple clue. You wanted to see me? Very much indeed. Thank you, Mr Hastings. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Now let's have a nice little talk. - What about? Why are you so certain that Rich was killed? I've gone into all that. - But you have no proof. All you have is your opinion of Rich. - Yes. Haven't you anything to tell me? Haven't you any facts that point to a murder? I don't need facts. Then why do you persist in this statement? Why do you want to drag our friends into an ugly police investigation? Why not let the facts speak for themselves? Mr Grant. Why are you so anxious to pretend it was suicide? I? - You. Why did you deny that it was you that found the body? That it was your scream that roused all of us? Alright. I don't deny it. I've loved Gordon for five years. I've been everything in the world to him. And I am going to stand before the world and say that I loved him. I knew him better than anyone else and he was not a suicide. Who killed him? I don't know. - Why was he killed? I can't imagine. I was making a new will for him. His old one left everything to you. Yes. You profited by his death. You alone. Yes. And yet you can't think of any reason why he was killed? No. Can you think of any reason why he killed himself? No. But when you tell me why he was killed I'll tell you why he killed himself. Hello, chief. Better be something important to wake me at this time of the morning. This man says that Gordon Rich was found murdered. He's got a letter for you. He won't give it to anyone except you. Here. How long has he been here? I telephoned as soon as he arrived. Where you live? I live with one of Mr Rich's aunts. I am Mr Rich's boatman, sir. How far is his house? - About ten miles. Why didn't they telephone? - They got no phone, sir. How did you get here? - I got a little pop boat. You're going back in the police boat with us. Have Captain Trask, Dr Higgins and the photographer meet me there in an hour. Wait a minute. Better send out a special alarm. All coastguard stations, all police stations with a radius of fifty miles. Tell them to pick up any launches or speedboats coming from the outside. Make them give a full account of themselves. Hold all suspicious persons. - I've got you. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Come in. Oh, Babs. Tommy, have you seen father? Did he question you? Why certainly. Of course he questioned me. Some of them downstairs think I did it. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I were arrested for this murder. Oh Tommy, you couldn't have. Oh, couldn't I? What questions did father ask you? He wanted to know if I loved you. And what did you tell him? You know Babs, you oughtn't to be in my bedroom at 3 o'clock in the morning. Isn't it terrible. - Yes, but supposing .. Oh, bosh! Alright, alright. What difference does it make if we talk in your bedroom or the sitting room? Or the kitchen or the lawn or the garage? Hey, hey. Suppose someone should come in this room now and find us. Are you so frightened? It's a clean bed isn't it? Clean pillows. Clean linen. A clean bed. For clean people. Tommy, come here. Come here. No, no. Not there. Stand here. That's right. Now kiss me. Tommy, is that the very best you can do? The same. But different. I don't understand. - I'm glad you don't, darling. Hmm. Come out of here. Gordon, I've got him. I've got him. I've got him. He wasn't in his room. And I can prove it. Oh, my darling. I knew you weren't a suicide. I won't let them make a coward of you. I just had to come back and .. And tell you. Goodbye, my dear. Give me that. Really, Miss West. You shouldn't go on like that. Those people downstairs will hear us. Think what that will mean. To find us up here. In this room. Murderer! It's true. I killed him. You admit it? What else can I do? You found me out. You were very clever. No-one suspected me but you. You'll tell that to the others, and to the police? No. Then I will. Let go of me. Will you let go of me. - Wait a minute. The man has gone. Nothing but good has come of his death. My daughter has been saved from a great unhappiness. She'll surely marry the man she loves and have a long, happy normal life. That's all you think about. That's all that matters to you. Your daughter. What do I care about her. But you are better off yourself. You will inherit all this money. As a matter of fact you are a very attractive woman. There's no reason why you shouldn't have a long happy life. If you will just forget. I'll forget when they put you in the chair and kill you. They will never do that. I can tell the police. I can make another paper figure and show them the shadow on the window. Charges. Nothing but charges. - Charges they'll believe. Charges that will be dragged through the courts. Charges of murder. Miss West, have you any idea of what charges really can mean? Have you ever seen a murder trial? No. I will wait for yours. - Wait for mine. Sit down. I will show you yours. - Don't be ridiculous. If you were on trial I'd be prosecuting. - Well? Well, there you are and here I am. You were in love with Rich. I heard you say it. Alright. He made a will in your favor. You would know. You drew it up yourself. - I'm warning you. Rich left you all his money. - Yes. You quarrelled with him because he was going to marry another woman. That is a lie. - You can't prove it's a lie. When I put you on trial you can't prove it is a lie. And what are you going to do when I say I heard you and Rich quarrelling? Huh? Have you thought of that? - I'm not afraid of you. You quarrelled with Rich because he was casting you off. I say I didn't. And then you went to his room and tried to make it up. I did not. - I heard you. When I was killing him I heard you cry out to him that you wanted to come in. And when I killed him .. I left no trace. And when you cried out to him you left your finger marks all over the door. It was locked. - I can prove it was open. A dozen witnesses will prove it was open. I was nowhere near him when he was killed. A minister of the gospel heard you scream and will swear to it. And right after that they all rushed out and found the door open and you gone. Why did you run away? Huh? Why did you run away? You screamed and ran away. - What does all this amount to? What does it amount to? It amounts to a lot. If only you've got the imagination to realize it. It amounts to what I can do to a jury. It amounts to what I can do in summing up. And I've done it a hundred times and you know it. May it please the court. Gentlemen of the jury. This woman Marjorie West is accused of the murder of her protector Gordon Rich. You all know how Mr Rich was killed and the murder made to look like a suicide. There has been no denial of certain facts. Rich was tired of this woman and he discarded her. He was on the eve of a marriage with a beautiful innocent girl who adored him. Life stretched out before him happily. That is what this woman couldn't bear. The thought that another was to take her place. That her fortune was to be swept away. Look at her. There is no murder in her face. But there was murder in her heart. When in the dark of night she crept from her room to his. What? The door was locked but he opened it to her. No. He had done it hundreds of times before. Who else could have come to him at that hour? And so. With a pistol concealed in the folds of her wrap she came to this man. And he, poor unsuspecting fool, let her come within striking distance. And before he could move or cry out or give an alarm. She placed the pistol close against his breast and fired. And then to hide this murder. She knelt beside the dead body .. And placed the pistol in his own hand and left him there. Left him lying there with the stigma of suicide on him. Who else could have killed him? Who else could have gained by his death? Who in all the world but this woman hated him? Look at her. The woman who was fired with jealousy. Insane with rage. She killed her lover to gain the millions .. He left her in the will he didn't live long enough to destroy. And I can prove it! - You wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare? I killed Rich to save my daughter. I risked my life to bring her happiness and contentment and save her from shame. And rather than fail in this. I swear I will send you to the electric chair. [ Police siren ] There is the police boat. [ Police siren ] Dawn is here too. You know how the fussy police are about people destroying evidence. And wandering around the scene of a crime. I think you had better wait outside. Hey. Get your powder. This is Mr Hastings. Chief of police? - That's right. Mott is the name. This is a very shocking affair. - Mr Grant is not with us at the moment. But if you gentlemen would come in and sit down I've no doubt we will find him. Well, well, well. Bill Mott. Right back at you, Dick. How are you? Fine. What are you doing here? - Well, what are you doing here? I am Rich's attorney. - Oh. Come on upstairs a minute. A pretty sensational murder isn't it. - Murder? Nothing of the sort. The plainest suicide you ever saw. You've been over the ground, have you? - Yeah, I've covered it pretty well. That's funny you know. Miss West wrote me that .. Well you know, she is very overwrought. Poor woman. You see, he was her lover. Well, she can't see why he killed himself. So that's it, eh? - Well, why did he? Well I don't know. You can search me. Come on. Take a look at it yourself. You don't want to lose a bet, do you. You never can tell what is going to happen. By the way I don't see how you horn in on this. What is the idea? - Oh, sort of bush-leaguing. You remember when I quit the New York department .. I brought my wife down here for her health. Before I knew it .. They made her chief of police. - Oh, that's nice. How is she by the way? - She is fine now. Great. He's dead anyhow. Shot through the left lung. Anything been disturbed, Grant? - No. No. Everything is exactly as you see it. Did you hear about my boy? - No. What's the matter? Don't you read the newspapers? He made the football team. - Well, what do you know about that. Better hold the shirt as an exhibit. It shows the powder stains here and here where it was burned. A pretty clear case, don't you think? I guess I'll have to report it that way. That's the way I figured it. Suicide. Do you know of any motive? - I'll tell you about it later. Funny the way he hangs on to that pistol. Yeah. I thought of that myself. But there it is. You can't go behind that. It's his alright. - Yeah? - Yeah. I can prove that. I was with him when he bought it. I guess you won't find anything on it but his own fingerprints. Look here, both of you. You'll probably never see a thing like that again. Final contracting of the muscles. In Rigor Mortis. It is the most marked case I've ever seen. Just what is rigor mortis, doctor? It's a medical term for the hardening and stiffening of muscles after death. You can almost see the fingers tightening. In this case it is very far advanced. In a few minutes I couldn't bend the arm like this. May I take a picture now, sir? - Sure. Go ahead. Move out of the way. - Excuse me. I guess that's all. No need to question these folks. Looks like a clear case to me. What do you say, Don? I guess that is the verdict. Death by suicide. Yes. That's what I thought too. We'd better take care of this body. Come on boys. Lend a hand here will you. Don't touch him! I've got to tell you that .. You did it, Rich. I didn't think he could. Dick! You're hit. See if you can't do something. Go on, kid. It was an accident. It couldn't have been anything else. I tell you .. it couldn't have been. Oh daddy, daddy. It's alright, kid. It's alright, Tommy is here. Tommy! You'll look after her won't you, Tommy? - Sure. 0h brace up, kid. Now brace up. How about giving the old man a kiss? Thank you, dear. Thank you, sir. Oh daddy. Daddy. Darling. You were going to say something. What was it? Well, well? What was it? I .. I don't know, chief. I just can't remember. Now. I guess that is all. Come on, we must get these bodies out of here. Donaldson, give me a hand here. (R0_s)
