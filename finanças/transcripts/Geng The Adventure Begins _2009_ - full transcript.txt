It never ends. Exactly! One war after another. - World War, Cold War, Civil War, Gulf War. - We now go live, state-side with news - from our reporter Rokiah. - There's no end to it. - Hey, move! - The villagers of Kampung Durian Runtuh have reported on the case of missing durian fruits in their orchards. - I've seen this place before... - In Malaysia, - we live in peace and harmony. - The villagers believe that this is tied - to the mystery surrounding the village. - We should all be thankful. To get a better understanding of this mystery, I have Senini bin Khamis here. Or better known as Tok Dalang. - That's my grandpa! - Sir, when did this incident start? Okay, is this thing on? I can start, right? It has been going on for quite some time. What is actually happening in this village? Well, every durian season, the durians go missing. But this time, the peels are scattered all over the place. It someone stole the durians, they wouldn't leave the skins around. Look at that... and that! If it was an animal, there would be holes. But these were peeled perfectly! I believe this is the work of the Durian Ghost! - Why do you believe that it was a ghost? - Of course it was a ghost! I've put out many traps but none were set off. I even have proof. Follow me. Look at this. Look! No persons or animals could've made these prints! But, isn't this a human footprint? Nonsense! Look at this. This toe is slightly longer. But this is your footprint. Oh, yeah. Not this one. It's over here. Look at this. It's different. - This is definitely the Durian Ghost's. - But, sir... If it's a ghost, how can there be footprints? There you go. The "mystery" of the Durian Ghost. Back to you at the studio. - Wow, my grandpa is famous now! - Hey, Badrol... does he know that we're going there? Yes, he does. Yesterday I-- Why are you bringing all those things? You know the phrase, "Prepare an umbrella before it rains"? That's right. My umbrella! Whatever, Lim. I'm going to bed. I'll have to wait forever before you finish packing. Hey, Badrol... where's my umbrella? MAY 16TH - GOING HOME DURIAN RUNTUH VILLAGE 1 BASKET What is it? Hey, mister... what happened? A tire was punctured. How long are we to wait? - Hello? - Yeah. - What's going on? - One of the tires blew again. - Where are you? - Same place. - Where's that? - At Batu Lima. Why does it always blow up...? You're lucky you're my father. What do we do now, mister? We wait. How long do we have to wait? Not that long. They'll be here tomorrow. Tomorrow? How much further do we have to go? See for yourself. DURIAN RUNTUH VILLAGE Gosh, I'm so tired, Badrol. When are we going to get there? You said we were almost there. Stop complaining. I'm tired too. You're just tired. I'm so thirsty. MYSTERY OF THE DURIAN GHOST? Why did you stop? Come on up. Peace be with you, Uncle. Peace be with you too. Thank you, Uncle. - What are you names? - I'm Badrol. This is Lim. My name is Singh. Just call me Singh. This is Pak Mail. - Where are you boys heading? - We're going to Durian Runtuh Village. That's where we're going as well. - Why are you going there? - To see my grandpa. He has a durian orchard. Durian? Yummy. I found a really big durian the other day. - As big as this truck. - Are you sure? Of course. Why would I lie? Boss! He thinks I'm lying. Here, look! What do you think? Nice, isn't it? I love taking pictures. Wherever I go... - I must bring my camera. - Wow! Whose house is that? It's huge. - Hey, don't ever go near that house. - Why, Uncle? That house was been abandoned a long time ago. - People say that place is cursed. - Cursed? Haunted. Have you ever heard of the Durian Ghost? There's been sightings of the Durian Ghost around there at night. So don't even think of going there. - What's Uncle Muthu doing? - Hey, what's Uncle Muthu doing? Let's go look. Higher, Uncle, Higher! Boss, one teh tarik please. - Get lost. - Hey, don't you have any snacks? I'm starving. They are not here yet, sweetie. Sweetie. Grandma! Grandma is here! Yay! Grandma is here! Yay! - Grandma is here! - I see my two grandsons are here. You need to go home with Ros, okay? - Okay, Grandma. - Okay. - Let's play tag. - Okay. - Tag! You're it! - Hey, Salleh. What's the matter with you? My name is Sally. S-I-L-L-Y. Silly? - Whatever. - Have you finished my dress? Not yet, Mak Uda. The buttons keep falling off. They're absolutely devastating to my beautiful nails. Well, just get it done quick. I'm planning to wear it to a wedding. - Ah Tong. - There she goes again gossiping. Did you watch TV last night? It was scary. Tok Dalang was talking about the Durian Ghost. There's no such thing as ghosts. It was a fox that ate those durians. I've been living here for so long. Grandma's been here even longer. There's no ghosts. Even more, no ghosts that eat durian. Rubbish. You know, Ah Tong... you never believe what people tell you. I need to tell my old man. - One day the ghost will come get you. - Hey, Salleh! Aren't you waiting for your snacks? It's fine. I'm full just looking at you. It's been a long journey. Uncle, are we there yet? It's been a long journey. Oh, we're almost there. Here we are. DURIAN RUNTUH VILLAGE That Mak Uda is always talking about ghosts. She's crazy. Muthu, how much do I owe you? Darn kids. I don't remember where my grandfather's house is. Let's just ask someone. You can't catch me! Hey, get down! Naughty kids!

It's okay, Uncle. - Do you know where is Tok Dalang's house? - Tok Dalang's house? Sure. Just walk straight ahead. When you see Uncle Samad's chicken coup, turn left. Then when you see the bridge, turn right. Wait, is that right? I'm also confused. Do you understand? Oh, no. You don't understand? Hey, come over here Upin, Ipin. No. You scolded us just now! Hey! Just come here. You two, go show them the way to Tok Dalang's house. Tok Dalang's house? Let's go. - It's easy. - Just follow them. - Thank you, Uncle. - Uncle Muthu. Oh, Ros.

Grandpa, this is my friend, Lim. - Mom and Dad send their love. - Peace be with you. That's it? What else, Grandpa? They should have sent along some money or a check... Something better than sending their love. Whatever. Come on in. SHADOW PLAY COMPETITION 2007 CHAMPION 2007 Shadow Play champion! Badrol's grandpa must be really good. - I'm cuter. - Hey, Lim. What would you like to drink? Anything is fine. - Just plain water? - You just said anything is fine. Allah is great. Finished your drinks? Why don't you two go for a walk around the village. I'm going to the mosque. We're tired, Grandpa. We've been walking all day. You're too young to be tired. Just take my bike. I can walk to the mosque. I'll be going now. The bike keys are by the door. The other bike is in the garage. Let's go unpack first. - It's been a while since I rode a bike. - I'm tired. Come on, just for a little while. Besides, we won't be walking. What's wrong with this bike? Great, it works. Hey, what are you doing? Go get your own bike. - What bike? - The one in the garage. Here are the keys. Still not tired after a whole day of walking. Now he wants to go for a ride. Don't be nervous. You must be calm when you drive. You have to imagine that driving is like... Everything okay? Yeah! You like eating my dust. You're just lucky. - I gave you a chance back there. - Whatever. - Yeah, right. - Hey! You've ruined my radio! You call that a radio? Sapy! See? You've made Sapy angry. Sapy! Go! I thought it was going to eat me. - I'm telling my dad! - Okay, we'll... - replace your radio. - No! Just tell us what you want. We'll get it for you. Okay? I want that. You mean this? Don't cry. We'll lend you a radio tomorrow morning, okay? - What's your name? - Raju. Where at tomorrow morning? At Tok Dalang's house. Okay. You promise? Yes, I promise.

We'll be out tomorrow morning anyway. - What are you worried about? - Oh, yeah. That's right. - Grandpa. - Yes? The other day you were on TV... what were you talking about? The Durian Ghost. What's with the Durian Ghost? It's like this. There's an old house deep in the jungle. It's haunted. Nobody dares to go near it. Oh, that's the house that Pak Mail was talking about. Right Badrol? If nobody dares to go near, how do they know it's haunted? Be quiet. What do you know? What does the ghost look like? It's horrifying! It's eyes are glowing red with razor sharp teeth. If it catches you... There was this one time, Pak Dollah... You remember him? He saw three of them! That's three, Grandpa. Have you seen it yourself? That's enough. I'm going to the orchard now. Going to the orchard? Aren't you scared? No. If I see it, I'll fight them off. Your grandpa is so brave. I'm much braver. Jeez! Grandpa! I'll be going now. Come on, let's go in.

Do you see it? - Yeah. - That's the one. Oh, my God. I'm dead. - That was fast. - Shut up. Can I borrow your radio? You! I can't even use the toilet in peace. Out of the way. Were there a lot of durians, Grandpa? Of course. And big ones too. But I only brought back one. - Only one. - That's not enough. This is mine. If you want to eat, go get it yourself. Grandpa, how do we get to your orchard? - You've forgotten? - I know! Oh, Raju. When did you get here? - At four this morning. - Go with them to the orchard then. He knows the way around the village.

Peace be with you. And peace be with you too. Dalang, have you seen my grandchildren, Ros and her brothers? - They haven't been back since morning. - Tok Dalang, have you seen Raju? This morning he told me he was going to your house. I told him to feed the cow. But now, the boy, the cow and the cart is missing. Listen, let's gather here after Maghrib. - We'll go look for them at the orchard. - Oh, okay. - I'll come back later. - Where can they be? - Lim, hurry up and get the fire going. - Hold on. I found it! Oh, what's that? Is that a pistol? - Don't disturb me. - We were just asking. What is Raju up to? Wow, fire. Oh, it's nice and warm. You brought too many useless things. Useless? What do you know? You're just a kid. A kid? Let's see. Hey, what are you doing? Don't. All my precious things. What's this? You even brought your robot? What? Robot! I want to play. Don't touch it!

I'm worried, Ah Tong. The Durian Ghost. There are no ghosts. How many times must I tell you? Ah Tong, don't say that so loud! The ghost will come. Oh no! We're done for! Where's the ghost? Tell it to come out. I'll shoot it. - Raju, what was that thing just now? - I have no idea, sis. I think it might be the Durian Ghost. - Durian Ghost? - Sis, where are we? I don't know either. It's so dark. How are we going to find the way out? I can't see anything. Hey, Raju... See if there's a flashlight in the bag. There's no flashlight. But what is this? Let's go, Upin, Ipin. We have to find the way out. Kak Ros, wait for me. Quick, Raju. You're so slow. Which way is out? What's that, sis? What's wrong, Oopet? Run! Stop chasing me! Run! Run! Oh, no! What do we do now?

There's so many of them. - They are so pretty. - Quick, Upin, catch one! Wow... They're so pretty. Pretty, pretty, pretty. Kak Ros, Oopet said he lost his mother back in the cave. - It's mother? - Oopet... how did it happen? When he woke up, he tried to find his mother. But he got lost. No wonder you were in the orchard. So you're the one who ate all those durians! - Oopet asking us to help find its mother. - What? Find his mother? How can we find its mother when we're lost as well? - But we have to help him, sis. - He must really be missing her. Fine, we'll help him look for her. Don't worry, Oopet, we'll look for your mother together. Yeah, you'll see her again soon. Hey, Upin, there's a firefly in your hair. Lower your head, Upin. - I caught a firefly! - Let me see!

Just you wait. Quick, Oopet, quick! Oopet! Let go of my brother. If you want him, come and get him. Good shot, Ipin. You're really getting on my nerves. You missed. Is that all? - Throw some more. - Go on. It's not like you can hit us. - How dare you. - You want to fight? Come on. - Upin. - Let's go. Badrol! Badrol! You darn boys! You think you can get away? You darn kids are so annoying. - Where is the way out? - Quick, move the boxes away. Kak Ros! Let's go, Oopet. Get out. Quick. - Wait for me. - Quick, Raju! - Raju, where's Oopet? - What? Oopet?

Run! Oopet is so happy to see his mother again. Come on, Ipin. Oopet! We can go visit your home, Oopet? What's wrong, Oopet? - Oopet's mother said we can't follow. - Why not? Then how can we play with Oopet again? This place is dangerous. We shouldn't have come. No one has ever come this far before. Oopet... we have to say goodbye now. - Badrol! - That sounds like my grandpa. - Ros! - They're looking for us. - Badrol! - Oopet, quick, run! Raju! - Badrol! - Quick, run! Run! Run! Oopet, don't turn around. Go home! It's okay. Don't be sad, Oopet. You can finally go home. We'll see each other again someday. Stop crying. That’s embarrassing. Don't forget us. Go now. Oopet! - Bye, Oopet. - See you again! Bye-bye. See you! - Badrol! - Raju! - Lim! - What happened here? Where are my grandchildren? What kind of mask is this? Don't wear it. It could be cursed. Hey, stop playing around. Grandpa! Grandma! - Badrol! - Upin. Ipin. Raju! Dad! - Grandpa! - Oh, my darlings. Are you all okay? - We're fine, Grandma. - Grandma! We were chased by a huge snake! - It had big sharp teeth! - Okay, dear. The most important thing is that you are all safe. - Raju, I was so worried! - Dad, where's Sapy? What? Sapy? You're the best at troubling others! - I can't even ask about Sapy? - No! - Hey, this belongs to you? - Thank you very much. - What a headache. - Hey, Salleh! What are you doing here? Grandpa, this is your Durian Ghost! - Him? The ghost? - He was pretending to scare the villagers. - He's one of the poachers. - Yeah! So that's what you've been doing. No wonder you couldn't finish my dress! It wasn't my fault. I was just following the others. You're just following is it? Now you can follow me to jail. Jail? What did I do wrong? Of course you're wrong. It's against the law to catch protected animals. I didn't know. I only followed orders from Pak Mail and Singh. What? Pak Mail and Singh? Who are they? How dare they scare the villagers like that. - Now you follow me. - Why me? - Hey, be quiet. - Badrol! Look what I found. Durian! - Brother Lim, crack it open. Quick. - Okay. - Where's Raju? - Raju is over there. - Raju, come let's eat some durian. - It's okay, bro. - Here, you can have it. - Really? Of course. We're a gang. We're all a gang. Sis, look. - What is this place? - Yeah, boss. This place looks unusual. - We'll be rich if we sell this. - You're right, boss. Slowly. THE END Ipin, how did Grandma get here? Hey, Tok Dalang! What are you doing? - Fall, fall, fall. Uda, help me out. - No, Mak Uda! - Quick, Uda. - No! - Uda! - Think about the future, Mak Uda! Mak Uda! Subtitle translation by Yves Liu
