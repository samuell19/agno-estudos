♪♪ (Mozart's "Requiem Mass in D Minor-Lacrimosa" plays) Miss Mitchell? (coughs) I expect an answer to my question, Miss Mitchell. If you'd care to join us. Is English your first language? (chuckles, coughs) Since Miss Mitchell seems to be carrying on a parallel seminar in a different language, perhaps someone else would be kind enough to answer my question? Dante looks into the face of God and says... All'alta fantasia qui manco possa. Correct, Miss Peterson. EMERSON: All'alta... fantasia... qui... manco... possa. (coughs) After the Tuscan Guelphs defeated the Ghibellines in 1289 at the Battle of Campaldino and Vicopisano... Something funny, Miss Mitchell? It was my fault, Professor Emerson. I was asking what page we were on. Hardly an appropriate question from a doctoral student, Paul. We began with the first canto. I trust you can find it without her help. And Miss Mitchell? See me in my office after class. Sorry about that. I'm, uh, Paul Norris. I'm Julia Mitchell. I'm sorry the Professor was such a prick. I don't know what's eating him. You're new? I just arrived from Saint Joseph's University. And you're here for your Master's? Yes. It probably doesn't seem like it. I'm supposed to be studying to be a Dante specialist (whistles) So you're here for Emerson? He's, uh, difficult to work with. I'm writing my dissertation with him. And there's also Christa Peterson. Christa? She's his other PhD student, but her goal is to be the future Mrs. Emerson. She just started the program and she's already baking him cookies. She doesn't seem to be aware of the University's strict non-fraternization policy. Anyway, you better go. Emerson hates waiting. It's down here, take a left. It's the corner office. Good Luck. EMERSON: I'm sorry I didn't call you back. I was in my seminar. It's the first lecture of the year, asshole, and the last time I talked to her, she said she was fine. Of course I wanted to be there. I loved her, too. I don't know what time because I don't know what kind of flight I can get, but I'll be there. Just... Just tell them I'm sorry. (sighs) I'm so sorry. (exhales) JULIA: "I'm Sorry. Julia Mitchell." (phone rings) Hey, Dad. MAN: Those Canadians treating you right? Yes, they're all pretty nice. Is everything okay? Grace Clark died earlier today. Did you hear what I said? Um... yes, I heard. I knew you'd take the news hard. She was like a mother to you, and you and her daughter Rachel were such good friend's in high school. Have you heard from her? Um... no, I haven't. I'm not even sure when they found out Grace was sick again. I was over to their house earlier. Gabriel wasn't there. Which has caused... quite a problem. Son of a bitch. Are you sending flowers? I guess, I'm not good at that sort of thing, but I could ask Deb if she would help. Ask her to send something from me. Grace loved gardenias. Get Deb to sign the card. Will do. Do you need any money? I'm fine. I'm sorry about Harvard. Maybe next year. Maybe. Talk to you later, Dad. JULIA: "Dear Rachel... I'm so sorry to hear about Grace. I'm... (sighs) Frightened Rabbit. Paul, hi. How was your meeting with Emerson? I didn't go. That's... not good. His office door was closed. I think he was on the phone. I left a note. Let's hope that's what was going on. Otherwise, I'd say you just took your life into your own hands. Let me know if there's any fallout, and I'll see what I can do. Oh, my God. Excuse me Miss Mitchell, can you come here for a minute? Yes, Mrs. Jenkins. Have you had some sort of problem with Professor Emerson? Um, I don't think so. I received two urgent e-mails asking me to set up an appointment to see him when he returns. Professors normally prefer to schedule their own appointments, but he insisted I schedule it and have it documented in your file. He said it was serious. Can you meet him at 4pm tomorrow in his office? (sighs) (groans) (moans) (scoffs) Hey, Julia. Wanna go for coffee some time? Um, yes, sure. It'd be easier if I had your number. EMERSON: Now, Miss Mitchell. Give him hell, Rabbit. Please be seated, Miss Mitchell. Move the chair. I won't crane my neck in order to see you. Are you a comedian, Miss Mitchell? I expect an answer when I ask a question, Miss Mitchell. Surely, you've learned your lesson by now? Perhaps you're not too bright. I beg your pardon, Dr. Emerson? It's Professor Emerson. Even chiropractors and podiatrists refer to themselves as doctors. Would you stop fussing with that ridiculous abomination of a bag and sit in a chair like a human being? I'm sure you thought this was funny. I can explain... I'm not interested in your excuses. I asked you to come to the last appointment. You didn't, did you? You were on the phone and the door was closed... It wasn't closed. I suppose this was meant to be funny too? It's not what you think. I wanted to say I was sorry, and it was for your family, who I... Leave my family out of it! I see that you came here on scholarship to study Dante. I'm the only professor in this department who is supervising theses in that field, and since this... is not going to work, you'll have to change your topic. Find another supervisor or transfer departments, or better yet, university. I'll inform the director of my decision, effective immediately. Now if you'll excuse me. That is all, Miss Mitchell. ♪♪ (Chopin's "Nocturne in E Flat Major, Op. 9 No.2" plays) (water splashes) (tires screech) You'll catch pneumonia and die.

I'll walk you in. One can't be too careful. Would you like a tea? May I take your coat, Professor? Where would you put it? That was rude. Uh... Forgive me. Would you like English Breakfast or Lady Grey? English breakfast. You should change into some dry clothes. (Emerson clears his throat) Why do you live here? It's a quiet street in a nice neighborhood. I needed to be able to walk to school. This was one of the nicer apartments I looked at. Why didn't you move into the graduate student residence? I was expecting to go to a different university, but that didn't work out. Where were you going to go? Miss Mitchell? Harvard. Harvard? What the hell are you doing here then? My father couldn't afford the parental contribution. The fellowship they offered wasn't enough, and the living expenses in Cambridge was than Toronto. I have thousands of dollars in student loans. I decided not to add to them. That's why I'm here. That wasn't in the file Mrs. Jenkins gave me. You should have said something. This is a terrible place to live. There isn't even a proper kitchen. What do you eat here? I cook soup and couscous on the hot plate. Couscous is very nutritious. You can't live off of that. A dog eats better. Forgive me. Um... I don't know what's gotten into me. You just lost your mom. I can't be here. I need to go. (knock on door) When was the last time you had steak? Uh, it's been a while. I'm starving, and you're joining me for dinner. Are you sure Professor? I thought this... wasn't going to work. Never mind that now. Um... Except... I could change. But I have one condition. Let's hear it. Tell me why, after everything you've said to me, should I join you? Because Emerson is an ass. But at least now he knows it. I'll change. (exhales) (exhales) Vanilla. What? Nothing. May I? Thank you. Ah, Professore Emerson. Cosi bello vederti. Antonio. E 'bello vederti anche tu. Stai guardando bene. Grazie, grazie. And who is this lovely lady? Antonio, this is Julianne Mitchell. Julia.

And I have a beautiful bottle of wine from my family's vineyard in Tuscany. Please don't go to any trouble. No trouble. E 'fatto. How did you come by your Tuscan accent? I spent my junior year in Florence. Impressive for only a year abroad. I started studying Italian when I was seventeen. I could order for you. Thank you, Professor Emerson.

Julia Mitchell? Is that you? Rachel? (both laughing) I can't believe it's you. You, too. Rachel, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry for everything. About your mom and... everything. I got your email, and the gardenias you sent were so beautiful. You remembered they were her favorite. How's your dad? He's... so lost. We all are. That's why I'm here. Why didn't you tell me you were here? I wasn't sure I'd be staying. The first couple of weeks have been really, um, rough. Rachel, we need to go. I'm making a home cooked meal, and you're coming over. I'm sure Miss Mitchell has other plans. Miss Mitchell? Julia's been my best friend since high school. What? I forgot you two never met. Regardless, your attitude is a little bit much. Do you wanna do me a favor and remove the pole from your keister? Why don't we meet for lunch instead? I'm sure The Pro... Your brother wants you all to himself. He's Gabriel. What is going on between you two? Rachel, she's my student. There are rules. She's my friend. I say screw the rules. Can someone please tell me what's going on? Gabriel Owen Emerson, were you an ass to Julia? You two will just have to kiss and make up. I'm only here for a week, and I expect to spend lots of time with both of you. (sighs) RACHEL: I... cannot believe I just ran into you. So I tried it, and I applied it to my head, and, of course, it did work. So, a week later, it grows back this big. So, my first day of seventh grade, I had a cowlick. Which was the best idea I'd ever had. Welcome. Gabriel, want to give Julia the grand tour while I start dinner? I'd like to show you something. Your study is so... beautiful. That's my favorite chair. Put these on. This is one of my most precious possessions. A shrunken head of a former grad student? (gasps) Is that Botticelli's original Dante and Beatrice and the fixed stars of Paradise? Sadly, no. That would be beyond the reach of my small fortune. The originals date from the 15th century. These reproductions are from the 16th century. I didn't know copies existed. They were probably done by a former student of Botticelli's. Botticelli prepared one hundred illustrations, but only ninety-two of them survived. I have the full complement. I went to see the originals when they were on loan to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Where did you get these? Why aren't they in a museum? They aren't in a museum because I refuse to give them up. And no one knows I have them but my lawyer, my insurance agent, and now you. RACHEL: Gabriel, stop boring Julia with your antique crap, and get her a drink. Hey, what is going on between you two? Why is he acting so weird? And why didn't you tell him who you are? I thought he'd remember me. He doesn't. So... what are we having with the wine? Couscous. (laughs) I'm so sorry. Stop. Stop! Stop, woman! Stop! For God sakes. Stop! You'll shred yourself to ribbons. This way. Hold out your hands. You don't listen, do you? You don't do what you're told. This is going to sting. There. (hisses through her teeth) I'm so sorry. Accidents happen. Is she all right? Yes, but she hates couscous. All right, then I'll make Rice Pilaf instead. There's something you need to know about Julia. I shouldn't know anything about her. She's my student. Her friendship with you already presents a conflict of interest. She's been broken, you jackass. That's why I haven't seen her in a year. She's finally crawled out of her shell, and you're forcing her back in there with your arrogance and condescension. So just cut it with the Mr. Darcy, Mr. Rochester, stuck-uppity bullshit. Treat her like the treasure that she is. Fine. (telephone rings) Ugh, it's Aaron. I've been trying to get 'em all day. Hi. I'm good. You are not gonna believe who I ran into. Did you know Rachel got engaged this summer? That's wonderful. Aaron's great. She ended the engagement last week. They're still together, but... she doesn't feel like planning a wedding now that Grace is gone. That's why she's here. To get away from it all. I know the feeling. Were you ever going to tell me who you are? You let me make an ass out of myself. I would have treated you better, if I'd known. Really? Would you? And found some other grad student to rip apart? If that's the case, I'm glad your anger was directed at me and not anyone else. This doesn't change anything. I am glad you're Rachel's friend, but... you're still my student, which means that we need to be professional, and you will be careful how you speak to me now and in the future. Yes, Professor Emerson. I have a bad temper, I can be destructive. It would be inadvisable for me to lose my temper around someone like you. Wrath is one of the seven deadly sins. I have all seven. Somehow, I doubt that. You're only a magnet for mishap, while I'm a magnet for sin. Sin isn't attracted to a human being. It's the other way around. Not in my experience. Sin seems to find me even when I'm not looking for it. I'm not very good at resisting temptation. Hey, Rach! I'm here. What happened? Gabriel is what happened. Is he hurt? (chuckles bitterly) Oh, he's fine. He's been here less than 24 hours, and he's shoved my parents, made my mom cry, and sent Scott to the emergency room. It'll be okay. It's not okay, Aaron. Gabriel shoved Scott into a table. Scott's not just gonna forgive that. My mom's in her room, hysterical. I can't even be here another second. I'll check on your mom. My family is so broken. Rachel. (door closes) You're a bit late for the show. You're hurt. You're cold. Thank you. Beer? Ever have a beer before? Then I'm glad I'm your first. What are you doing here? I was invited to dinner. I guess I ruined that. Will you tell me what happened? Will you tell me why you haven't run away yet? You smell like vanilla. It's my shampoo. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I didn't mean... The prodigal son returns... More like demon. The demon Gabriel. JULIA: You're all the Clark's talk about. Maybe Grace invited you over because she knew I needed an angel to watch over me. The sun is setting. Would you like to go for a walk? Have you ever held a boy's hand? Then I'm glad I'm your first. You're very quiet. Talk to me. I promise I won't bite. Why did you come home? I lost something. And you're trying to find it here? What I lost is lost forever. I came home for money. I was... I was fucked up even before I destroyed everything and everyone. Before you ever arrived. This is it. This is paradise. You'll catch pneumonia and die. You're Beatrice. Who's Beatrice? Dante's Beatrice. Dante was a poet. And Beatrice was his muse. He met her when she was young... and loved her from afar his whole life. She was his guide through Paradise. I'm writing a book about them. There's a famous painting by Henry Holiday. You look like his Beatrice. Your family loves you. You should make up with them. They aren't my family. Not really. And it's too late anyway. You haven't had dinner. For you, Beatrice. Have you ever looked up at the stars with a boy lying next to you? You're beautiful, Beatrice. My brown-eyed angel. I think you're beautiful, too. Have you ever been kissed? Then I'm glad I'm your first. Open your eyes. Gabriel? What are you thinking? About how I waited for you for so long, and you never came. It's okay because you're here now. Apparuit iam beatitudo vestra. That's pretty. What does it mean? Now your blessedness appears. But it should be "Now my blessedness appears." Now that you're here. For the rest of my life, I'll dream of hearing your voice breathe my name. Do you have to leave? Yes, but not tonight. Will you come back? I'll be thrown out of Paradise tomorrow, Beatrice. Our only hope is that you find me one day. Look for me in Hell. What's this for? Aren't you going shopping with Julianne? It's Julia. And no. She's working on a project with a guy named Paul, and then he's taking her to dinner. Angel fucker. What? Take it. Buy something nice for your friend. Gabriel, I know you have money to waste, but jeepers, this is a bit much. She carries a loathsome excuse for a bookbag. Spend the money on buying her a decent briefcase, because if I see that bag one more time, I'm going to burn it. Okay, I'll buy her a briefcase. I'd rather buy her shoes. - Shoes? - Yeah. She likes pretty things. She just can't afford them. She's pretty cute, huh? Spend the money on whatever you like, but you must replace the book bag. I have an account at Holt Renfrew. Oh. I'll buy her something fabulous. Should I add lingerie to the list? How old are we? Do you like her, like her? She's my student. Should I tell her that the briefcase and shoes are from you? Are you crazy? I could get fired for that. Someone will jump to the wrong conclusion, and I'll be hauled in before the judicial committee! Why are you wound so tight? Are you having girl troubles? And, by the way, what are with those photos in your bedroom... I am not having this conversation. Don't bark at me. I'm sorry, okay? Just... just don't tell her it's from me. She wouldn't accept them if she knew. She... she hates me. Julia is not the type of girl to hate anybody. She's far too forgiving for that. But you're probably right. She probably wouldn't accept charity. Tell her it's for a backlog of Christmas presents. Or tell her it's from Grace. PAUL: I'll show you the Dante collection, then my study carrel which is next to it. Well, not mine. Emerson shares his with me. Here it is. Pretty impressive, right? The carrel's just down here. Can I ask you a personal question? Why didn't you go to Harvard? I overheard Emerson asking Greg Matthews, the chair of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard, about you. He was wondering why they didn't have enough funding for their grad students. He sounded pretty pissed. He was checking up on me? Of course. Well, from what I could hear, Matthews said to send you back for your PhD. Said you were highly ranked in their admissions pool. So, if it isn't too personal, why didn't you go to Harvard? I couldn't afford it. I didn't want to come here. I had no other choice. I was hoping to finish my MA quickly and go to Harvard next year. If I win a larger fellowship. I can relate. You should use this carrel for studying. Emerson is rarely here. I'll give you my extra key. Emerson hates me. He won't like this. I insist. Please, Rabbit. Thank you. Do you like Mozart's Requiem? Not really. Emerson ruined it for me. He was playing one track from the damn thing over and over again while I was cataloging part of his personal library. Lacrimosa, Lacrimosa, Lacri-frickin-mosa. I couldn't take it anymore. It's so damned depressing. I love Mozart's Requiem, and Lacrimosa is my favorite part. Uh, I've got tickets to a German film on Saturday. Wanna go? Sure. Is it subtitled? Good, because I only know how to swear in German. ♪♪ (Mozart's "Requiem Mass in D Minor-Lacrimosa" plays) (no audible dialogue) (knock on door) ♪♪ (Mozart's Requiem continues) (telephone rings) Hello.

It's so funny that you say that. Gabriel said almost the exact same thing. Gabriel would come with us? He isn't happy about it, but he didn't say no. I have nothing to wear. Hmm, I happen to know a certain delivery was made today. That was you!? Do you like everything? It's too much. I can't accept it. The shoes are... Julia, please. I'm so happy that we're friends again. Apart from running into you, and getting a chance to get close to Gabriel again, nothing good has happened to me since my mom got sick. Please, just think of it as a belated birthday present, and early Christmas gift from me and my mom. Thank you, Rachel. Ok, so we're gonna pick you up at 9. Be ready. Bye! Gabriel, Julia is gonna come! (laughs) - Ethan. - Mr. Emerson. This is my sister Rachel and her friend, Julianne. Julia looks so beautiful, right, Gabriel? Really, really gorgeous. Please, Rachel, What? Isn't she beautiful? You both look fine. So, how was your date with Paul? It was really nice. Are you gonna see him again? Yes. Tomorrow he's taking me to a double-feature at the Film Festival, and then afterward, to Chinatown. Is he cute? He's handsome and kind. He treats me like a princess. Angel fucker. Alicia!

Just move your body. You look great, by the way. My brother is an idiot. She's with me. I was fine. And he was nice. He put his hands on you. We were dancing. I tripped. I didn't hear you asking me to dance. That would rather defeat the purpose of watching, don't you think? I promised you a taste. No. I insist. Let me feed you. I can feed myself. Of course you can, but why should you... when I'm here to do it for you? (coughs) That's awful! It tastes like a campfire. That's the peat. It's an acquired taste.

But you do remind me of Beatrice, from Holiday's painting. Isn't it funny that you own it? Gabriel. Your dress is lovely. And those shoes are... exquisite. Rachel and Grace are very generous. Unlike me. I never said that. I was hungry and you fed me. That was generous. Promise me you'll tell me if you're starving. I won't let you starve. I promise, but I'm okay.

I may have picked it out, but Gabriel's actually the one who bought it. What? Why? Just open it. It's Italian. We both know you and Gabriel have a thing. For Italy. I was not supposed to tell you it was from him. He would kill me if he found out that I told you. I don't need his charity. It's not charity. He hates your knapsack. I have a lifetime guarantee. I can just go get a new one. This is way too expensive. It's not like he's gonna miss the money. Professors don't make that much. Julia. Gabriel's, like, super rich. What? So, you know my parents adopted Gabriel when he was nine? My mother found him wandering a hospital in Sunbury. His mother had just died. Pneumonia, I think. He was poor and starving. My parents adopted him after his family rejected him. I'm so sorry, Rachel. I didn't know. So, a few years ago, his biological father died, and for some reason left him a huge inheritance. I think he's trying to stick it to his old man and spend the money faster than it accumulates interest. Gabriel pretends to be whole, but deep down he hates himself. I did tell him to be nicer to you, so I think his behavior will improve. He ignores me, mostly. Uh, don't you notice how he stares at you? He does? Gabriel has been on the outs for so long. He's finally letting me back into his life. If you refuse this bag he's gonna know that I told you. Please... Okay. I'll take the bag. For you. Good. If you want, you can pretend it's another birthday present from me. I don't really celebrate my birthday anymore. (sighs) Have you heard from him? Not since I changed my number. I could run him over with my car for what he did to you. I wish Gabriel had taken a page from your book and learned a thing or two about how to deal with heartbreak. Can you watch over him for me? If you see him start to act strangely, or if he gets in trouble, call me? With our mom gone, I just... I worry about him. Sure. I am so glad that you're around. You can be his guardian angel. So, Paul seems nice. What does the "V" stand for? (sighs) You, uh, promise not to tell anyone? Of course! It's Virgil. Virgil? You're studying to become a Dante specialist, and your middle name is Virgil? Don't laugh. It's a family name. After my great-grandfather, a dairy farmer from Essex, Vermont, who I can guarantee you never read Dante. I think it's a beautiful name. Little Rabbit. Isn't this cozy? Slumming with M.A. students, Paul? Two coffees, Christa? Pulling an all-nighter? Oh, you have no idea. One for me and one for Gabriel. Oh, Professor Emerson to you. You've never called him Gabriel to his face. I dare you to do it the next time you see him. You dare me? Funny. After our meeting, we'll probably head over to Lobby for drinks. He likes to go there after work to, you know, unwind. You're not his type. Excuse me? I said, don't believe the hype. As if they'd let you in. PAUL: That's enough Christa. I just meant you have to pass some kind of standard I.Q. test first. And from what Gabriel says, you're not very bright. Oh, really? And what else does Gabriel say? Paul. Miss Mitchell, you're looking smart, as always. Miss Peterson. Now, where were we? I'm sorry. I should never have kissed you. It's okay. I've wanted to kiss you since the first day I saw you, but... Julia, the kiss doesn't have to change anything. Just think of it as a moment between friends. Would that make it better? You've been nothing but nice to me. I'm nice to you because I want to be. Don't feel obligated to do anything you don't want to do. I'll be your friend no matter what. And if one day, you want more... I'm not ready. I know. (sighs) Looks like Emerson's giving Christa hell. You should have given her hell for how she talked to you. I try not to lower myself to her level. I like to think goodness can expose evil for what it really is. Not that I think I'm good. I don't think I'm good. I'm not making any sense. Of course, you're making sense. We talked about this in my Aquinas seminar. Evil is its own punishment. Refill? "Dear, Miss Mitchell, "Congratulations, you are the recipient "of the M. P. Emerson Bursary in the amount of $5000 per semester." (gasps) Shh, Julianne. Julianne, it's just me. What are you doing in my carrel? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I borrowed Paul's key. I'm so sorry. I'll get out of your way. I'm sorry. Julianne, it's all right. You're welcome to be here. Julianne? Julianne? Are you ok? What happened? I think you grew light-headed when you stood up too quickly. It's warm in here. I don't mind you using the carrel. I'm glad Paul offered it. Is he here? He's at Princeton presenting a paper. Ah, yes, that's right. (sighs) That's a fine briefcase you have. Thank you. There appears to be something alive in it. May I? (chuckles) Oh, this is, um... nice. R? Who is R? It's a nickname. Why not B? Beautiful. Have you had dinner? No. Join me? Are you sure? I am not the kind of person who makes idle invitations. If I invite you to dinner, then I'm sure. Now, are you coming or not? You can talk about your thesis proposal. Thank you, Professor. ♪ So, in time ♪ ♪ The color fades ♪ Their Caesar salads are quite good, as is their Neapolitan pizza. But they're quite large. Are you the type to share? I mean, would you share with me? Or order whatever you like. Perhaps you don't like pizza and salad. I'd like to share with you. Thank you. Are you cold? Thank you. Better? Better. So, let's hear it. I see the wheels turning in that little mind of yours, so out with it. I can't accept these. What makes you think they're from me? You can accept them. And you will. I don't think this is very professional, Professor Emerson. It looks like you're trying to buy me. Buy you? If I wanted you at all, I certainly wouldn't have to buy you. Watch it. I meant... you are not the type of woman who could be bought, are you? Why do you do that? Provoke me? I don't. I'm not... You are my professor. And your best friend's older brother. Can't we just be Julianne and Gabriel for an evening? It might not seem obvious to you, but I'm trying to be human here. You are? You wish to be professional, then act like it. Accept the bursary, like a normal grad student, and be profoundly grateful. I don't want to play Héloise to your Abelard. I would never seduce a student. Then thank you. Never be ashamed to accept a gift when there are no strings attached. Grace used to say that. (cell phone vibrates) Paulina, what is it? Excuse me. I'm sorry. I gotta go. I... The waiter will pack up your meal. Good night, Julianne. I'll see you on Wednesday. If I'm still here. Julia! - Hey, Ethan. - Hey. First of all, thanks for helping me with my girlfriend the other day. I scored major points. Glad I could help. I could use your help again, though. Sure. Give me your cell. - No, actually, it's Mr. Emerson. - What? Ok, so he's inside, super drunk. He does not do well with getting cut off. I need to get him into a cab, so maybe you can come inside, persuade him to leave? I'll try. He's with one of his students. Yeah, not sure what I can do about that. (whispering) (whispering) Are you kidding me? Don't they teach you how to carry a tray in waitress school? Professor. Miss Mitchell. To what do I owe this unexpected delight? Can you help me get a cab? I need to go home. Of course. Anything for you. And I do mean anything. But first, a drink. I already have one! Does it pair well with couscous? I'm sorry. I shouldn't make fun of your poverty. It's past your bedtime. You shouldn't be in a place like this. Time to get me home then. JULIA: Okay. After you. On second thought, I can walk. Then I have time for another drink. No! Let's go. (elevator dings) (laughs) You picked me up, you naughty little kitty. I didn't pick you up, I'm dropping you off. And if you keep this up, I will drop you. Good night, Professor. I've lost my keys. But I've found my glasses. I feel sick. Come on, Professor. Let's get you to bed. (laughs) What's so funny? You, Miss Mitchell. You're taking me to bed, but you haven't even kissed me yet. Don't you think we should canoodle first? I haven't even had a chance to pet you, you naughty little kitty. And you're a virgin, aren't you? You've never canoodled a day in your life. I'm taking you to your bedroom so you can sleep it off. - Now come on. - Then kiss me good night, and I'll go to bed like a good little boy. Please don't hurt me. Never. Beautiful Julianne. Sweet like candy. I'm sorry, Julianne. I'm sorry I was a bad boy. It's all right. Come on. (vomiting) Mmm-mm. (belches) Mmm-mm. (vomiting continues) Are you gonna be all right for a minute? (Gabriel grunting, retching) (Gabriel panting) Gabriel, you've thrown up all over yourself. Do you want to stay like this or... Let me. Julianne... Please don't leave me. I'm not going leave you. Sleep now. Ti amo, Dante. Eccomi Beatrice. (cell phone vibrates) Hello. WOMAN: Who the hell is this? Who's this? It's Paulina. Put Gabriel on. He's, um, indisposed at the moment. Indisposed? Listen you little slut, roll him over and put the phone in his hand, I'm calling from... Please call back tomorrow. (hangs up) Beatrice. You found me. You remember? I thought you had forgotten me. Never. I missed you so much. I should have waited. I love you. I love you so much, it hurts. "I'd given up hope, until you looked "into my eyes last night and finally saw me. "Apparuit iam beatitudo vestra. Your Beatrice." What the hell are you doing? (gasps) I asked you a question! What the fuck are you doing in my clothes? Don't you remember last night? No, thankfully I don't! And get the fuck up off that floor! Don't you dare speak to me like that, you lousy drunk. Who the fuck do you think you are? I should have let Gollum have you! I should have let you fuck her brains out in front of everyone on top of the bar at Lobby. What are... What are you talking about? Hau ab! Verpiss dich! How did you learn to swear in German? Bite me, Gabriel! What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm getting the hell out of here before I take one of your stupid bow ties and strangle you with it! Who's Gollum? Christa-fucking-Peterson! I saved you from fucking her! Did you and I have sex? (scoffs) In your dreams. That's not an answer. Of course you would have to be drunk to want to fuck me. Who said anything about fucking? Whatever happened, consider yourself lucky you don't remember. Julianne, just please... tell me... tell me I wasn't rough with you. You didn't hurt me. You wanted someone to put you to bed and keep you company. You were actually more of a gentleman last night than you have been this morning. I think I like you better when you're drunk. Julianne, I think very highly of you. You're beautiful, you're innocent and sweet. But what happened last night can't happen again. I apologize for kissing you. Oh, that? I'd forgotten all about it. It was nothing. I'm just glad I didn't hurt you. You hurt me. You hurt me. Why did you sign the note the way you did? You begged me to come after you. To look for you in Hell. Well, that's exactly where I found you, and you can stay there for all I care. Beatrice? You were my first kiss. I fell asleep in your arms in your precious orchard. Beatrice, wait! Wait! Wait! Beatrice! I'm not your Beatrice anymore. ♪♪
