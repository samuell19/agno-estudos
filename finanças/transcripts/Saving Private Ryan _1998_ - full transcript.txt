Dad. Clear the ramp! 30 seconds! God be with you! Port side stick, starboard side stick, move fast and clear those murder holes. I want to see plenty of beach between men. Five men is a juicy opportunity. One man is a waste of ammo. Keep the sand out of your weapons. Keep those actions clear. And I'll see you on the beach. Clear the murder holes! Over the side! Port and starboard, over... Jesus. Thank you... I said, what the hell do we do now, sir? Captain Miller! Captain Miller! -Captain Miller! -Sergeant Horvath! Move your men off the beach! Go! Okay, you guys! -Get on my ass! Follow me! -Sir! What's the rallying point? Anywhere but here! The seawall! Move up to the seawall! Sir, I'm staying! Clear this beach! Make way for the others! This is all we got between us and the Almighty. Every inch of this beach has been pre-sighted! You stay here, you're dead men! Mama! Mama! Stay down! Stay down! What are you guys? 104th Medical Battalion, sir! Here to set up field operations! Get rid of that crap! Grab yourselves some weapons. Follow me. -I'm hit! I'm hit! -Briggs! Get me out of here. I'm hit low. God! -Medic! -Navy Beach Battalion, sir. I gotta clear these obstacles, make holes for the tanks. All the armour is foundering in the Channel. Orders, sir. You go somewhere else. I'm clearing this one! Come on, Briggs! Medic! Move! Move! Move! Come on! Move! Shore party. No armour has made it ashore. We got no DD tanks on the beach. Dog One is not open. -Who's in command here? -You are, sir! -Sergeant Horvath! -Sir! You recognise where we are? Right where we're supposed to be, but no one else is! Nobody's where they're supposed to be. Shore party. First wave, ineffective. We do not hold the beach. Say again, we do not hold the beach. We're all mixed up, sir. We got the leftovers from Fox Company, Able Company and George Company! Plus we got some Navy demo guys and a beachmaster! Shore party. Shore party. CATF , CATF ... -Reiben here, sir! -Did you see anybody else? -Jackson, but that's about it. -Mellish here. Caparzo! We got DeForest back there with Wade. He's hurt so bad he says he sprung 100 leaks. Wade says he's all used up. -Move on to somebody you can help. -Let's go! He's battalion surgeon, sir! -Get his attention. -Wade! -Yo, Doc! -Wade! -Wade! Wade! Wade! -Wade! -Wade! Wade! Wade! -Too risky, Doc. Too risky. -Wade! -All right. Get him off the beach. I got it! We stopped the bleeding! We stopped the bleeding! Fuck! Just give us a fucking chance, you son of a bitch! -Son of a fucking cocksucker! -Wade! Come on. Come on. Wade! It's Mellish! Wade! -Mellish! -Let's go! We found Miller! -Fuck it! -Let's move! Let's move! This is all? This is all that's made it? We got scattered pretty bad, sir. There's bound to be more. -Not enough. It's not enough. -Dog One exit... It's gotta be that cut on the right. -Or is that one on the left? Shit! -No. No, no, no. Vierville is to the west of us. This is Dog One. They're killing us! And we don't have a fucking chance, and that ain't fair! Gather weapons and ammo! Come on, let's drag them in off the sand! Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben, where's your BAR? Bottom of the channel, sir. The bitch tried to drown me. Find a replacement. Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores! Grenades, grenades! Get me some grenades. Get them over here! Bangalores up the line! Bangalores up the line! Heads up! Bangers coming your way! Come on, come on, come on! -Jackson here, sir! -Reiben back, sir! Oh, my God! One more. Give me one more. Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm gonna die! Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God! Keep it moving. Keep it moving. Almost got it. -Jesus! Lucky bastard. -Come on. -Move it! -Keep it moving. You got it? God! God, help me! You're not gonna die. You're not gonna die. You're fine. Don't look at it. Don't look at it. Bangalores! Clear the shingle! -Fire in the hole! -Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole! We're in business! Defilade! Other side of the hole! That's it! Let's go! Inspected. Morphine. Routine. Priority. He's gone. Son of a... -Get in there. -Fuck. I can't move. -Mellish. -Yes, sir. Give me your bayonet. Two MG42s and two mortars. Add 20, left 30. There's a little defilade over there, but it's the perfect fire position if we get some goddamn armour on the beach. We gotta open up this draw! We gotta get this draw open. Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war! Grab some cover and put some fire on that crew. Davis, Debernardo, Young, Valk, get ready. Covering fire! Go, go, go! Goddamn firing squad. It's the only way we can get everybody the hell out of here. Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes! You're next! Why don't we just hand out blindfolds, Cap? All we can do here is die. Covering fire! Go, go, go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Go, God damn it! -Jackson. -Sir. -Do you see that impact crater? -Yes, sir. That should give you complete defilade from that machine-gun position. Get in there and give me some fire discipline. Wait for my command. Go! Captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset. I thought you were my mother. Be not thou far from me, O Lord. O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee. I detest my sins for having offended thee, O Lord. I detest my sins for having offended thee, O Lord. Listen to me, Lord. All my strength, haste thee to help me. -Dog One exit! Right here! -We're in business! Move! Move! -Reiben. -Let's go, Sarge. Go! Reiben. The place is full of 'em! Come on, Doyle! Sarge? -Flame! -Doyle, do it! Don't shoot! Let them burn! I'll give you "comrade," you son of a bitch! Lie down! Cease fire! Cease fire! Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire! Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3. Say again, Dog One is open. Send in the dozers. I'm waiting for you to tie in my flanks. Over. What? What? I'm sorry, I can't understand what you're saying. What did he say? What did he say? "Look, I washed for supper." God damn it! -Hey, Fish. -Yeah? Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife. And now it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right? Keep it moving! That's quite a view. Yes, it is. Quite a view. "Dear Mr Brian Boyd, "no doubt by now you have received full information..." -"Dear Mrs Jensen..." -"...untimely death of your son." "...no words of mine can ever relieve the grief..." "Our outfit has felt his loss tremendously." "He was a fine soldier and he believed very strongly in..." "It's no secret any more that we were involved "in one of the most important operations of this war." "Al was the one who held us all together. "He was always the first to volunteer..." "...came to a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed..." "Your husband served in a combat unit "whose dangerous duty is to place itself..." "...which we all cherish and hold so dear. "The loss of Lee and others like him is a distinct blow to the regiment." "I fully understand your desire "to learn as much as possible regarding the circumstances "leding to his death." Colonel, I've got something you should know about. Yes. These two men died in Normandy. This one at Omaha Beach. -Sean Ryan. -This man at Utah. Peter Ryan. This man was killed last week in New Guinea. Daniel Ryan. The three men are brothers, sir. I've just learned that, this afternoon, their mother is going to be getting all three telegrams. That's not all. There's a fourth brother. The youngest. He parachuted in with the 101 st Airborne, night before the invasion. He's somewhere in Normandy. We don't know where. -Is he alive? -We don't know. Come with me. God damn it. All four of them were in the same company in the 29th Division, but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau. Any contact with the fourth son, James? No, sir. He was dropped about 1 5 miles inland near Neuville. But that's still deep behind German lines. Now, Mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped. General, first reports out of Ike's people at SHAEF said the 101 st is scattered all to hell and gone. There's misdrops all over Normandy. Now, assuming Private Ryan even survived the jump, he could be anywhere. In fact, he's probably KIA. And frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flathatting throughout swarms of German reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be KIA, too. I have a letter here, written a long time ago to a Mrs Bixby in Boston. So bear with me. "Dear Madam, "I have been shown in the files of the War Department "a statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts "that you are the mother of five "sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. "I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine "that would attempt to beguile you from the grief "of a loss so overwhelming. "But I cannot refrain from tendering to you "the consolation that may be found "in the thanks of the republic they died to save. "I pray that Our Heavenly Father "may assuage the anguish of your bereavement "and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved lost, "and the solemn pride that must be yours "to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom. "Yours very sincerely and respectfully, "Abraham Lincoln." That boy is alive. We are gonna send somebody to find him, and we are gonna get him the hell out of there. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. We expected 32 tanks to float to the beach. Twenty-seven didn't make it. -Miller, Charlie Company. -Go on in, Captain. I understand your situation. But if we don't offload those duel-drive Shermans by 0600, we're gonna have an entire division stuck at Carentan with its pants around its ankles. Well, you let me know then. Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville until we can get some armour up there. Yes, sir. Runner! Airborne was supposed to win an open door for the rest of us. Instead they misdropped, scattered all their sticks into the wind. -What's your situation? -Yes, sir. Sector four is secure. We... We took out towed 88s here, here and here. They'd already gotten four of our Shermans and a number of our deuce and a halves. These two minefields are actually one big one. We tried to make our way up through the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed, high-density field, little bit of everything. Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s, pot mines. A-200s, the little wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up. This road here, they placed big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s, I guess for our tanks, from here right up to the edge of the village. Right here. So we marked them, called the engineers. Resistance? We had higher support expectations, sir. There was an under-strength company without artillery. Wehrmacht 346 Infantry, Von Luck Kampfgruppe. We ended up with 23 prisoners. We turned them over to MPs from the 29th. What about our casualties? Well, the figures were 35 dead, times two wounded. They just didn't wanna give up those 88s. It was a tough assignment. That's why you got it. Yes, sir. John... I've got another one for you. -Yes, sir. -This one's straight from the top. You and I are taking a squad over to Neuville on a public-relations mission. You leading a squad? Some private in the 101 st lost three brothers, and he's got a ticket home. How come Neuville? They think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops. It's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war. Like finding a needle in a stack of needles. But what about the company? We take the pick of the litter and the rest get folded into Baker. Jesus Christ. They took away your company? It wasn't my company. It was the Army's. So they told me, anyway. Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson, Wade, Beasley and Caparzo. Beasley's dead. All right, Mellish, then. We got anybody speaks French? -Not that I know of. -What about Talbot? -This morning. -Oh. All right. I'm gonna go try to dig up another interpreter. Assemble at battalion motor pool on the beach. Yes, sir. -Sarge, what we gonna do? -Okay, listen up... -What? -What are we gonna do? You're going home wrapped in an American flag with a hunk of cheese in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass. -Now, listen up. -I thought you liked it in the ass. -What? -I thought you liked it in the ass. Attention! As you were. I'm looking for Corporal Upham, Timothy E. Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir. I understand you speak French and German. -Yes, sir. -How's your accent? Just a slight one in French, but my German's clean. -Has a touch of Bavarian, sir. -Very good. You've been reassigned to me. Grab your gear. -We're going to a place called Neuville. -Yes, sir. -When was this updated? -Updated as of 0830 hour this morning. -Sir... -This is the 1 2th SS Panzer. These are the two axes that advance south. -Sir, there are Germans in Neuville. -There are artillery up here, sir. -That's what I understand. Corporal. -Yes, sir. Sir, there are a lot of Germans in Neuville. You have a problem with that, Corporal? No, sir. Just if you consider I've never been in combat, sir. I make maps and I translate. And that's... I need someone who speaks French and German. -Yes, sir. -My two guys were killed. Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't held a weapon since basic training, sir. Did you fire the weapon in basic training? Yes, sir. -Well, then, get your gear. -Yes, sir. Sir, may I bring... May I bring my typewriter, sir? Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir. -That a souvenir? -No, sir. Take your time, Corporal. You should look on the bright side of things, Corporal. Yes, sir. For one thing, you don't need to carry those. -You'll need that. -I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir. Hey. You want your head blown off, you fancy little fuck? Don't you ever fucking touch me with those little rat claws again. Get the fuck back in formation. I was just wondering where you're from, that's... -Caparzo, is it? -Hey, drop dead, Corporal. Got you. And another thing. Every time you salute the captain, you make him a target for the Germans. So do us a favour. Don't do it. Especially when I'm standing next to him, capisci? Corporal, what's your book about? -Hey. Watch your rifle. -Sorry. Actually, it's about the... It's supposed to be about the bonds of brotherhood that develop between soldiers during war. Brotherhood? What do you know about brotherhood? Get a load of this guy, Fish. Why don't you ask the captain where he's from? Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you everything you wanna know about him. You wanna explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense of risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy. Twenty degrees. Anybody wanna answer that? Reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother. Hey, doc. I got a mother, all right? I mean, you got a mother. Sarge has got a mother. I mean, shit, I bet even the captain's got a mother. Well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers. "Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do and die" What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Corporal, huh? We're all supposed to die. Is that it? Upham's talking about our duty as soldiers. -Yes, sir. -We all have orders we have to follow. And that supersedes everything, including your mothers. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Even if you think the mission's FUBAR, sir? Especially if you think the mission's FUBAR. -What's FUBAR? -Oh, it's German. Yeah. Never heard of that. Sir, I have an opinion on this matter. Well, by all means, share it with the squad. Well, from my way of thinking, sir, this entire mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. Yeah. Go on. Well, it seems to me, sir, that God gave me a special gift, made me a fine instrument of warfare. Reiben, pay attention. Now, this is the way to gripe! Continue, Jackson. Well, what I mean by that, sir, is if you was to put me and this here sniper rifle anywhere, up to and including one mile ofAdolf Hitler with a clear line of sight, sir... Pack your bags, fellas. War's over. Amen. Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin. So, Captain, what about you? I mean, you don't gripe at all? I don't gripe to you, Reiben. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command. Gripes go up, not down. Always up. You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers, so on, so on and so on. I don't gripe to you. I don't gripe in front of you. You should know that as a Ranger. I'm sorry, sir, but... Let's say you weren't a captain, or maybe I was a major. What would you say then? Well, in that case, I'd say this is an excellent mission, sir, with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan, and am willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to ease her suffering. -He's good. -I love him. Right. -Thunder! -Flash! Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go. Go, go, go, go, go! -You guys are a sight for sore eyes. -Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up. How many are you? Just eight of us. We're not your relief. Sorry. You're not the relief, what do you mean, sir? We're here for a Private Ryan. Who? Ryan? What for? -Is he here? -Well, I don't know. Maybe with a mixed unit on the other side of town. It's hard to get to. The Germans punched a hole in our centre a few hours ago, they cut us right in two. -What's his name again? -Ryan. James Ryan. He dropped in with 101st. -Goldman, get me a runner up here. -Runner! Come on. Jonesy, make a hole up there! We got stopped by some intense rifle action from the eastward. The Germans have been reinforcing two regiments all day. The streets have been quiet for about 45 minutes. Most of the German fire now is concentrated to the westward. Who's that on the loudspeaker? That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf, our friendly neighbourhood morale officer. The Statue of Liberty is kaput. -"The Statue of Liberty is kaput." -...kaput. That's disconcerting. Take the second left... Your father was circumcised by my rabbi, you prick! Private Ryan, James, probably misdropped with the 101 . -Got that? -Cover! Go! -You sadistic fucking animals! -Get down. They know we're not in direct contact. They're gonna single out the runners. Yeah. Why do they keep shooting him up like that? Long as his lungs have breath in them, he still carries the message. -We'd do the same thing. -No, we wouldn't! -Wade! Get them ready to travel. -Yes, sir. -Boyd! -Come on! Try again. See if you can let Captain Hamill know we're coming. What's the rest of Neuville look like? Next block's got two-storey buildings, both sides of the street. -There's a lot of windows. -...copy? Over. And then there's a wide open square with pretty good cover on the left. -Show me. -Sarge, hold right here. Yes, sir! All right. Let's stay out of this enfilade and use the buildings. Try a left hook. Shoot and scoot, two of yours, two of mine. Hastings, Goldman, up front! -Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals. -They're still jamming us. Short runs. High and low at the corners. It's gonna be tight. Be prepared for close contact. -Go. Upham. -Yes, sir. -You stay with Sergeant Horvath. -Stay right here. I'll wear him like underwear, Captain! Stay with me. All right, past the end of the block to the left. Those are the gates to the square. Good. Reiben, where's the captain from? You figure that one out, you got yourself a nice prize. 300 bucks, last I heard. Company's got a pool. 5 bucks gets you in. Easy. It's around this corner. Defilade right up to those gates. Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living. I've been with him since Kasserine Pass, but I don't have a clue. My ankles are killing me. I'll need a wheelchair before this war is over. Oh, that's it. Oh, my God. Got ankles like an old woman. Like an old... Oh, God. Reiben, so, you don't even know where he went to school? Captain didn't go to school. They assembled him at OCS out of spare body parts of dead Gls. You gotta pay attention to detail. I know exactly where he's from and exactly what he did 'cause I pay attention to detail. Hey, Upham, careful you don't step in the bullshit. -Do it. -Thunder! Thunder, or we will fire on you! Upham, tell them to show themselves. Ask them if they know where the Germans are. -What's he saying? -Something about the children. -They want us to take the children. -No, no, no. We can't take the kids. We can't take the kids. We can't! We can't take the kids! No! They think they'll be safe with us. It's not gonna be safe when they're with us! -It's okay. It's okay. -Are you nuts? Listen to the captain! -Are you nuts? Listen to the captain! -They think they'll be safe with us, sir. Caparzo! Put that kid back! It's okay. -Caparzo! Put that little girl back! -It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Caparzo, give that kid back now! Upham, how do you say, "It's okay"? I can't. She reminds me of my niece, sir. Caparzo, get the kid back up there! Captain, the decent thing to do is to at least take her down the road to the next town. We're not here to do the decent thing! We're here to follow fucking orders! Sarge, take this goddamn kid! Cover! Cover! God damn it! Where'd that come from? He was on the ground before we heard the shot. That's where I'd be. I didn't see it. Four hundred fifty yards, Captain. Maybe a shade under. I wouldn't venture out there, fellas! This sniper's got talent! Please don't cry. I'm gonna take you back to your mama and papa. Please don't cry. Come on. Carpy. -Captain. -Hold on, Caparzo. Help me up. I can walk. I can walk. Caparzo, stay still! Two clicks, left wind. Fish! Captain, can you see him from there? How is he? Wade, you stay put. Where's he shot, Captain? -Captain, can you see him from there? -You stay there! Damn it, stay down! What's the matter with you? Am I gonna take care of you if you get hit? Huh? -Fish, come over here. -Carpy, put your head down. Why can't you put your head down? O my God, I trust in thee. Let me not be ashamed. Let not my enemies triumph over me. Copy it. Copy it and send it for me. Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself. Put it down! -It's got blood! -I see it. Carpy, I see it. It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish. We got him. Stay down. -How bad is it? -Chest, maybe lung shot. Get that 30 up the street! Detail! -Clear up! -Clear down! That's why we can't take children. Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check. Upham, canteens. Fill them up. -Sergeant Hill. -Yes, sir. Gather your men. We'll form up at the northwest corner of the square. -Jackson! -Sir. Mellish, check the tower, hustle back here. Right now. Go! Fuck Ryan. -Thunder! -Flash! Come on in. Hey, guys, we're looking for Captain Hamill. Somewhere down there across the square. Across the square. Go easy. Watch for snipers. Sit down. Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill, bring him in here. What? Up there? How the hell should I know? Would you go look, please? Thank you, you moron. All right. You guys just flake out here for a while. Let me get this goddamn hitchhiker out of my boot. Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons! -Drop them now! -Drop the fucking weapons! -I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you! -Drop! Drop! Drop them! Now! Put them down! Clear up! -Shit. Shit! -Clear up! Clear down! -Enough to make you old. -Let's hope so. Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 101 st. John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you. We're here looking for a Private James Ryan. He's part of your outfit. Any chance at all you policed him up? -How was the road in? -Scenic. -We lost most of our ammo. -Not to mention one of our men. Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka to the right side of the road. -Yes, sir! -And get Ryan up here. Ryan! Ryan, front and centre! Ryan! Here comes our boy. Told you he was an asshole. -Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered. -At ease. Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers. He wants a word with you. This way. All right. Take a knee. Private, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. Well, there isn't any real easy way to say this, so... So I'll just say it. Your brothers are dead. We have orders to come get you because you're going home. Oh, my God. My brothers are dead. I was supposed to take them fishing when we got home. I'm so sorry, James. I can't tell you how much. -How... How did they die? -They were killed in action. That can't be. They're... That... That can't be. My brothers are still in grammar school. -You're James Ryan? -Yeah. James Francis Ryan from Iowa? James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota. What? Does that mean my brothers are okay? Yeah, I'm sure they're fine. Are you sure they're okay, though? We're looking for a different Private Ryan. This is just a big foul-up. How do you know? How can you be sure? How do you know the foul-up isn't that his brothers are okay and that... Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble. I just wrote them a letter right before I left. I got to get home. I got to get home right now. -I wanna go home. -Easy, now. -So, where in the hell is our Ryan? -I don't know. Are you in touch with your CO? -That figures. -What unit's your Ryan in? Baker Company, 506th. The guy with the broken foot, he's 506, right? Yeah. Charlie, I think. -You think? -Yeah. Ryan? Don't know... Man! -Where was your drop zone? -Just inside of Vierville. Vierville? How the hell did you end up way up here? You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire. Pilot went crazy trying to get out of there, turning every which way. Took more fire on the drop. Got messy. I ended up here. I haven't seen a single guy from my stick, sir. God knows where they are. Anybody from Baker Company have, like, a big mouth? Talk about where the drop zone might've been? No, sir, but I know Baker Company had the same rally point as us. Show me. My men are beat. We're gonna hold up here for about three hours. We'll pull out after dark. Got anything left in this town like a three-star hotel? Something with clean sheets and soft pillows and room service? -How about a nice, comfy church? -We'll take that. What have you heard? How's it all falling together? Well, we got the beachhead secure. Problem is Monty's taking his time moving on Caen. We can't pull out till he's ready, so... -That guy's overrated. -No argument here. You gotta take Caen, so you can take Saint-Lô. You got to take Saint-Lô to take Valognes. Valognes, you got Cherbourg. -Cherbourg, you got Paris. -Paris, you get Berlin. And then that big boat home. We sure as hell could use you around here, but I understand what you're doing. -You do? -Yeah. I got a couple of brothers myself. -Good luck. -Thank you. No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home. What's with your hand? I don't know. It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for embarkation. It comes and goes. Well, you may have to get yourself a new line of work. This one doesn't seem to agree with you any more. What? -What? -Nothing. What was the name of that kid at Anzio? The one that was always walking around on his hands, you know? And he was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze. -Vecchio. -Vecchio. Yeah, Vecchio. He was a goofy kid. Remember, he used to pee a "V" on everybody's jacket for Vecchio, for victory. He was so short. He was a midget, wasn't he? "How did you get to be a Ranger?" He got shot in the foot once, didn't he, when he was walking on his hands? Yeah. He could walk faster on his hands. He could run faster on his hands than... Vecchio. Yeah. Caparzo. You see, when you end up killing one of your men, you tell yourself it happened so you could save the lives of two or three or 10 others. Maybe 100 others. Do you know how many men I've lost under my command? -How many? -Ninety-four. But that means I've saved the lives of 10 times that many, doesn't it? Maybe even 20, right? Twenty times as many? And that's how simple it is. That's how you... That's how you rationalise making the choice between the mission and the men. Except this time, the mission is a man. This Ryan better be worth it. He'd better go home, cure some disease, or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something. 'Cause the truth is I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans for one Vecchio or one Caparzo. Amen. Look. There it goes again. Sir, are you all right? Now, look, we're gonna move out in two hours. Why don't you get some sleep? -I don't know how he does it. -What's that? Falls asleep like that. I mean, look at him. The guy's lights out the minute his head hits the pack. Clear conscience. Yeah. What's that saying? "If God's on our side, who the hell could be on theirs?" "If God be for us, who could be against us?" Yeah, what did I say? Well, actually, the trick to falling asleep is trying to stay awake. How is that, Wade? Well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day. So the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home. So what I used to do, I used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as I could, but it never worked 'cause the harder I tried, the faster I'd fall asleep. Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have mattered none in my house. My ma, she would've come home, shook me awake, chatted me up till dawn. I swear, that woman was never too tired to talk. Yeah. That's probably the only time she could get a word in. Funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and I'd pretend to be asleep. -Who? Your mum? -Yeah. She'd stand in the doorway, looking at me. And I'd just keep my eyes shut. And I knew she just wanted to find out about my day, that she came home early just to talk to me. And I still wouldn't move. I'd still pretend to just be asleep. I don't know why I did that. We only got a couple of hours. Shut up and go to sleep. Captain? Sir? Corporal? How you doing there? Are you all right? Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir. Really? How is that? "War educates the senses, "calls into action the will, "perfects the physical constitution, "brings men into such swift and close collision "in critical moments that man measures man." Yeah. Well, I guess that's Emerson's way of finding the bright side. -You know Emerson, sir? -I know some. So, where are you from, Captain? What'd you do before the war? What's the pool up to? You know, I think it's around 300, sir. Well, when it gets up to 500, I'll give you the answers, and we'll split the money. How about that? Well, if that's the way you feel, sir. I feel it's my duty under your command to suggest that we wait until it gets up to 1 ,000, sir. What if we don't live that long? -500? -500 would be good, yeah. -Yes, sir. -Yeah. -Get some sleep, Corporal. -Yes, sir. Who's got sulfa powder? Medic! My buddy's bleeding! He needs a tourniquet! -Wade. -Yes, sir? -See what you can do. -Yes, sir. Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer. How we doing here? All right. Yeah, doing all right. Don't worry about it. Doc's in town.
