This is one of the true stories that originated during the catastrophic 1969 earthquake in Banja Luka. In the main roles And for the first time on film Production Design Costumes Director of Photography Composer Screenplay and Direction I'm superintendent here. I'm willing to help. What was your name? - What's my name? What was your name? - Stojan Husic. Not anymore. You're 6574 now. Repeat it. 6 - 5 - 7 - 4. Yes. March on. Who are you now? 6 - 5 - 7 - 4. A DAY LONGER THAN A YEAR It all depends on you, Ramo. - I'll do my best. You must succeed. You must ask the governor and make him let you go. Clear? If he agrees, it'll be clear to him later. Agreed? - Agreed. - Good luck. - Thanks. Come on. What is it you want, Ramo? Please, comrade governor, let me go home, for a day or two? My kid's seriously ill... just to see him. I've never asked for anything. The superintendent knows I'm not lying. Please, understand me. I can't sleep nights. I just want to cry. Who told you? I got a letter. - His wife came too. My kid has to be taken to the hospital and there's no money, nothing. Please. Ramo, wait over there. Go on, wait there. Go. How is his behavior? - Exemplary. How much longer? - Five years. Check his story and let him go for two days. It's a bit irregular. Others are given regular leave when they're in trouble. Trouble isn't regular, superintendent. I'm just saying, we have better inmates but we never let them go. I said to check and let him go for a couple days. In any case, inform his police precinct about him. Understood, comrade governor, I'll check right away. When will you be back, Ramo? If there's no complications, in two days. Breathe some ozone for us too. Drop in on my people, it's on your way. I don't have permission, Zmijanjac. Don't forget anything. - Don't you worry. Call on my wife, while your organ works. She hasn't seen one for three years now. With you, even longer! His organ's in his belly. Meho! Stop shitting, damn you. Be serious. His kid's ill. You pack like you're going for good. Ramo! - Here. Let's go. Ramo isn't back yet. - He escaped on his own. Is he that mean? Someone must've squealed on us. Shh! Irons is listening. You're sure it's him? - No one else, the bastard. I'll strangle him. Yes. Banja Luka prison here. You haven't heard from Ramo? I know. The police haven't heard from him either. I know that too. He didn't go home? He wrote a postcard to the governor. A real nice man, is he? Official and Lucara are talking. Only they can shorten my sentence. Be careful. They're dangerous. They can also shorten your head. Any news? Ciao amigo, governor. Thank you like a brother. Thankful to the grave, your Ramo. Farewell. What does Irons say to this? Talk with him right away. Don't worry, I'll find out. So he fooled me. Shall we put him on the wanted list, comrade governor, or shall we wait a bit? Let me do that. All police stations of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On October 21st, 1969, an inmate of Banja Luka prison, Ramo Idrizovic, escaped, son of Adil and mother Nafa, born October 10th, 1934 in Laktasi, and sentenced to prison for six years. Do everything necessary to arrest him and bring him to Banja Luka prison at once. Official, you don't know where Ramo is? They say he escaped. Who was planning to escape with him? Escape? I'm fine here. Careful, Official. I know you were planning to escape with Lucara. Ramo is out to scout for you. It was your idea. - No, yours. You're a humane person. I'm here because I'm not. You'll kiss the sky in solitary, Official, if we don't find Ramo. I'm telling you. Like you say, sir. I say 10 days of solitary to start with. Like you say. - Take off your cap. Your cap! Yes. 5 more days for not learning anything in 5 years. Damn rascal. Take him away! Who's the informer, damn him? I'll nail him to the floor. It's not me. May I burn like a cigar. Listen, Irons. If you squeal on us, I'll beat you until you start shitting. Stop it. I haven't said a word... though I know a lot. I don't mind getting life because of you. I'm fed up with your tricks. Damn you, scoundrel. Lucara, to report. Official, follow me. Come on, faster. You hit quite well. Miss Zorica, you got it again. - Stay with me. We'll put some bandages tonight and it'll do you good. And on with our news broadcast: Still no results in the search for escaped convict Ramo Idrizovic. All who know anything about this dangerous criminal should report to the nearest police station. Yes. Irons claims that they were connected with Ramo's escape? And Official refuses to admit it? Don't worry, he'll admit, sooner or later. Give them their breakfast. I'm coming now. Any news about Ramo? Alright. Bye. Excuse me for barging in. Hold it. Hold it! Where is Ramo? Where is Ramo? Speak, monkey, where is Ramo? I think he's in my left ball. Interesting. Where is Ramo? He's in the right one now. Help! Open the doors! Fatima! Fatima! Run to the plains, I must go to the prison. Open up! Run there! Any deaths here? We don't know. - Any deaths in town? The town's destroyed. - Go to the hospital. What'll we do with the men, comrade governor? Wait! What to do? No one enters the building. Take care of the wounded. Get away from that wall. Come here! Get them in line, no panic. Line up. Close that gate. Come on, faster, hurry up. Five years. Four. Eleven. Fourteen. A triple murderer. Five. Seven. Six years. Ten. A double murderer. The town's destroyed. There are many wounded, and dead too. From this moment on, there's no governor, no convicts and no guards. We're all equal. I'm releasing you to help the town and your families. But please, come back in 7 days. I have nothing more to say. You're free. Comrade governor, you're wanted. - Thank you. Why not wait a bit? - Release them all? - All. Lucara and Official too? - I said everyone. They're just human garbage. - Don't insult them. Do you need help? - Thanks, no. Understood. The situation is delicate. You must think of the consequences. Forget theory now. They're people. I said you're free. Oh, my children! Stop! Stop, I'll shoot! Stop, I'm shooting! Convicts! Go there quickly. Unit halt. Left turn. Ready. Follow me, shooters. Stay put. No one go back. Where are you going? There. - Get back. Wait, I'll explain. No explanations. Get back! We're free. - Get back! Ready! Aim! Shall we run, Official? What is it? Ramo escaped without you? You mentioned a beating too? Listen, Official, maybe you and Lucara are stronger than me in prison. But I'll wait and settle accounts when we're alone. This iron bar up my sleeve made me famous in prison. - Beat it, Irons. You'll remember me. That's it, master. But without this mob. Alija! Follow me. What are you doing there? - What do you want? Run away. - Where to? As far from here as possible. Get lost. To work! Official. We've waited for this for 6 months now. A man could get killed here. No thanks, we can manage. Fool... you deserved it. Grandma Kate, earthquake, run! - Who are you? I'm Aga, your grandson. Earthquake, you hear? Run! What earthquake? It's a lie. They're frightening the people. It's all just propaganda. What propaganda? Get up. - Leave me alone, child. What are you doing? - Come on, hurry. - People! What is this? Don't go in the house. Stop! Take her to the hospital, quickly. Hurry, what are you waiting for? The hospital, over there. Quickly! Comrade, where's the hospital? - There. Please, where is the hospital? - To the left. Stop! Drive quickly. Faster, faster. Faster, faster! Sorry, you can't go inside. Please. Doctor, how is the little one? OTC to all radio amateurs in Yugoslavia. Attention.

OTC to all amateurs in Yugoslavia. Banja Luka calling. We urgently need medical crews, drugs, food, blankets and tents. We're singing for free now, raising the morale. Bless you, son. Look, Stole. Professor, take him to the hospital. Alright. Meho, look for Lucara. We'll take care of him. Long live the earthquake! - Long live! We're all equal now! There are no rich and no poor! No sane and no sick! Hit us hard, God, turn us into dust! Hit us, oh God, before it's too late! God, if you're there, look upon us! Is it, Professor? Is that ours? Our kitty. Comrade girl! - Zorica! Uncle! - Uncle! You're being rude. Miss, pardon me! - Beautiful, pardon me! Zorki, Zorki! - Ciao, ciao, Zorki! Is he crazy? If not for the earthquake, I wouldn't know he was insane. Crazy, my balls. He's homosexual. How? I screwed him for three years and he insisted he was a bookkeeper. URGENT CASE - ZAGREB HOSPITAL Faster, or he'll die. Hurry. I told you we'd meet again, scoundrel. Where are you going? Pardon. Doctor, patch this one up and give him back to me. What's with him? - A slight case of chicken pox. Oh, God. WE WILL BUILD BANJA LUKA OUR REGION ALL FOR ALL ALL FOR BANJA LUKA Who's in charge here? People, wait for help in your villages. We can't divide it easily. Who's in charge here? Answer the question. Dule, there's some canned food, if they want. What canned food? - People, help is coming soon. What help? What cans? We're not looking for help. We came from the mountain and brought bread and salt for you. That's the custom. Here you are. - Thank you. Let's have our orders. This is my war unit. Look at them, all heroes. Report to headquarters. Brigade, attention! Brigade, forward march! Sing! There are still real people. And I offered them cans, fool. Official, they're mine from Zmijanje, relatives, neighbors. May I ask them about my kids? Why are you asking me? You're free to go if you want. I'll be right back. Hold on! Let's go. Wait. We're a part of these people. A darker part, but still a part. For half an hour I searched for the hospital. I searched, I asked. By my freedom, I searched. When I arrived, it was too late. For the first time in my life, I wanted to do an honest job. I'm just sorry, Official, that no one will believe me. You believe me, don't you? You believe me? Mommy, here's the old man! It's my Meho! Are they all alive? - Everything's destroyed. Meho, all we had is gone. What will become of the children? It'll be alright. Woe is me! Look, look! Everything's demolished? - Everything. We'll get a new house for free. Why are you here? - I was released. Where's the boy? - Upstairs. Don't scold him, please. Who are you looking for, convict? - Him. My father. Where are you going? Your mother says she hasn't seen you for days. And you for years, Official. Aren't you the Official? - I am. He was the true Official, once. C'est la vie, papa. Dragan! Help! Good evening. After the catastrophic earthquake that destroyed Banja Luka and Bosanska Krajina, the situation is still very critical. Seismic stations recorded 30 weaker shocks and no one can say for certain whether the danger is over. In Banja Luka, time is measured in minutes. People are being evacuated from the town. Thousands of fires burn everywhere. The dead were buried yesterday. Help is needed with blood plasma, blankets and food. According to the first evaluation, in the city not a single building was untouched. Hundreds were destroyed. The medical center no longer exists. The City Council meets in a park. Soon after the catastrophe, help began arriving from around the world, at first from nearby towns: Prijedor, Jajce, Bosanska Gradiska, Doboj, Slavonski Brod, Nova Gradiska, and then from Zagreb, Belgrade, Sarajevo, Skopje. All Yugoslavia shares the pain of Banja Luka. Crews of sanitary experts, seismologists, construction workers, mining teams, together with truck loads of food, bread, water, blankets, tents, medicines, building materials. Convoys by truck and rail are pouring into Banja Luka from all over Yugoslavia. And as help arrives daily, the first trains with children leave Banja Luka for safer places. Banja Luka has become the conscience and duty of all of us. Cars from all over the country are seen. Banja Luka today is the largest Yugoslav town. Mitar, what have you done? I chopped down the tree of that shit who's to blame for my three years in prison. If he sees you... He's in town. Tell no one I was here. Get inside. The kids... I saw them through the window. There's no time. I must go back now. Come in, Mitar! Official. I want to talk to you as a man. You've been in prison ten years, like me. And now you save those who convicted us our whole lives. We've received more beatings than anybody. We have nothing in common with them except the sky we see, but ours is darker. The state will give them new flats. Their lives won't change. All they'll build for us are new cells. Let's escape, Official. It can't be worse than here. They released us on our word. The first time someone was kind with me, with us. I gave my word and I intend to keep it. If I escape, I'll escape when I get back to prison, on my own. With you, never. You talk nonsense, Official. They've given us up for good. When they set us free, for them we remain just "Official" and "Irons". We can't be friends to them. Get lost. Hello, Eagle? This is Falcon. Do you hear me? Allow only with passes, only with passes. Is it alright? - Yes. Hello. This is a modest present for the suffering population of Banja Luka. - Thank you. I'd like a receipt. - Over there. Thank you. That's Baccara. We spent 6 years in jail together. He's the worst bastard and he's giving gifts. People can change. - Maybe it's not Baccara? Baccara! It must be him. Let's go. Kokan here, others as agreed. Is comrade Baccara free? - Who am I speaking with? I'm from the Banja Luka reconstruction committee. I came to thank him. Baccara! You didn't expect me? - No. Aren't you happy to see me? - No. It must be something big if you're here to grab it. What is it you're after? You don't seem to trust me. Maybe you want me to give you over to the police? The prison's empty. We're all released. I've never doubted your abilities. What do you want? What do you offer? I need to get to the viscose factory. They recovered the paychecks, but the safes are still buried. I could take a man's head off but not his paycheck. How will you get out? - It's alright. Everything's alright. You think I'm giving wallets away for free? It's all accounted for. There were some thefts in town. A big robbery happened last night. I doubt it was unorganized. You suspect my men? - Everybody's suspicious. They wouldn't do that. - Are you certain? - Yes. I'm not. I don't believe two hundred people can change overnight. I trust them. They baked the first bread here. They're helping people, working. What do you want? Bring them back to prison. - I can't. I take all responsibility, and that's it. Then our talk is over. - It sure is. Bye. Ciao, amigo governor. It's a sad Sunday for the white roses, my dearest is flooding them with her tears. It's a sad Sunday for the white roses, my dearest is flooding them with her tears. Last Sunday, I was lost without you. Last Sunday, I was lost without you. The days are longer than years. Get up, everyone. Lucara, wake them up. Come on, get up. What are you waiting for? Gather us all together. - What's up? Some vultures are plundering the town. Everyone suspects us. We don't know who it is, but if we catch him, we'll judge him ourselves. Who's missing? The drivers are out of town. The bakers are at work. Where's Irons? I know about him. Where is Zmijanjac? Lucara. Go to the station with two men. - Yes. You'll cover all the roads. Meho, with me. Others, go as agreed. Maybe he's the thief. I don't think so. Paragraph 141, heavy assault. I'm not sure. He's been gone a long time. I was with my people. We were talking, and passed the night. Why are you lying? Where were you? I went to my village. To see my kids, wife, house. Everything's destroyed there. So the others came. Where are the stolen goods? Speak up, liar! What goods? Baccara's in town. I know exactly where he is. Let's hurry. - Are you certain? He's there with his gang. We have to hurry. - Should we believe you? By my freedom. Everyone follow me. Baccara, this way! Follow me! Surround them! There! Why are you with them? Get away quick! Speak up! Following my chance. - You can get killed. One must prove he's a man. As Official used to say. You forgot, my old man? Go back home! Where are you going? Not there! Come back! You! - Me. Bang, and I've got it. My little naughty one. It doesn't bang, it whispers. Hear? I hear nothing. I see nothing. God, why have you punished me like this? He punished you real hard. I've robbed half my homeland, but I've never seen anything like this during my fertile experience. My poor little orphans, just shining. Precious. - Beautiful. Beautiful, Tough, but our honesty is more precious. Police! Where do they come from? - Screw them. Then we must. - We gave our words. We must be honest. - We've always been honest. Unfortunately. How is he? - He needs hospital care. He's doomed to escape in an ambulance. So it seems. I'd better go with him. He's fox, he'll escape from you too. What are you doing here? Nurse, what's this? Don't you see he's dying? Give him some air! Get back, people! Give a little light, give some air! Let's go, let's go, there. Doctor, we want to know what will happen, how is he? Who are you? Want me to let him die and go to prison because of him? Let's go, get back! Where are you going? - But I told you... I'm his brother, if he needs blood I can give it, same blood type! And I'm... his aunt. Ciao, amigo! It got lost in the grass. Pardon. Name and surname. What? Name, name... Banja Luka prison, room 11. Name. - Name? It's nothing. I found it in the grass. The grass must've been high. Somewhat less high. Less so? - Well, this high. Give them your name. What's you name? - Miloje! That's it. Miloje. And your surname? - Nothing. How could you say grass? Why not mud? Damn you, Tough! Professor, there was no mud around. I can't lie. Stealing again? - Self-defense! They're free now. What are you waiting for? Go on! What am I here, a guard, a kapo? You can all go to hell. Go on. - I only said... And I say that we all gave our word. Calm down. Another day and we go back. Everybody is tired. Go rest. Meho! Take the children away, Meho! In a flower field where the sun shines, a baby duck walks with daddy duck. And once she saw there in the golden grain, a red poppy standing. And the duck asked her daddy, Tell me, daddy, tell me now, will I ever be able to reach the red poppy? And the old duck wisely answered, You won't do that because your mother made you small. People, a son! A son! May he be happy and live long! - Thanks, thanks! People! People! My son is born! My first born! My first son! My son is over there! You scared me, I thought, another earthquake! What's the matter? - People, a son! Wait, give him to me. Zaim! A son! Jovo! Jovo! Look how big he is! Jovo! Like the godfather! Godfather! - Will you call him Jovan, like me? He was born in first class, let him be called First! He was born during the earthquake, let him be called Quake! That's it! Good man, I don't understand you. I congratulate you, good father! Let me try, to see if I've forgotten! Brother, have a drink, my son is born! Maybe you know him, comrade? He has no identity card. A scoundrel, stealing right now. And the duck asked her daddy, WE'LL BE GOOD! SEE YOU, MOTHER! Will I ever be able to reach the red poppy? And the old duck wisely answered, You won't do that because your mother made you small. And reaching for poppies isn't really a joke, because you are so small, because you are so small. Now you've learned what you didn't know before, yes, while you're so small, you can't pick poppies. And reaching for poppies isn't really a joke, because you are so small, because you are so small. Now you've learned what you didn't know before, yes, while you're so small, you can't pick poppies. Is there a Svetlana here? - There are three Svetlanas. Hadzic. - Not here. Are you Svetlana Hadzic? - Yes. Do you know me? - No. Maybe it's better like that. Thanks, uncle. In a few years she'll become pretty. Wedding, flowers, cheers. And me the best man. Music will play in our street. Life is in front of us, old boy. However it is, it's ours. Let's go. One morning, as dawn broke, it dawned, it dawned, there played on our street a tambura, a tambura. What's the time? They should be back by now. God will pay you for this. Shall I wait? Wait. - How long? Five or six years. Damn you, bastard. Open up! Excuse me, I'm a bit late. What's up, Meho? Am I the only fool around? - Not the only one. They might've used the side door. What side door? - I'll go see. Comrade superintendent, 198 men are present. Irons is in the hospital, Stole is absent but justified. Ramo, back to the ranks. Attention! Left turn! To your rooms. What do you want, Ramo? I'd like to ask you, governor... - To go home? I sure would like. You'll all be free sooner. How are the kids? Fine. But not too healthy. Have you finished all jobs at home? I did my best. Planning another kid? - That's to be seen. Ciao, Ramo! Ciao, amigo governor! You kept your word, did you? - Everything's fine. What's fine? We've never had a chance like this, never. Our escape is prepared. No one will get us ever. Bravo, Ramo. - Agreed. Good luck. - We'll see.
