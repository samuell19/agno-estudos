- Come on Sarah, eat! - Yeah, now they think that it might be a nut allergy, of all things, it's crazy. Hailey, would you get your brother for school please? Yeah, no, I can come pick you guys up. - Cameron get down here now! - I just need to drop some paperwork off at the school. Please don't yell in the house. - Mom, I don't wanna go to school. - You need to go to school. And you need to eat your breakfast. - I'm not hungry. - We go through this same thing every morning. - Why do you have that stupid stuffed animal on the table? - Shut up! - Whatever. - Tell me about it. Now there's somebody at the door. It's been a crazy morning. God knows who's here so early in the morning. Great, nobody's here! - Mommy, mommy, mommy! - Hailey? Cameron? Hailey! Hailey! Cameron! - Susan, is everything okay? - Hailey, where are you! - Thank you so much. Y'all ready for the big festival? Y'all got your wheelbarrows ready for the race? This year's first place prize, gonna be $2,000. So who's gonna win that big race? - I don't know why you haven't broken up with that penis yet. He treats you like shit, girl! Bye, I'm gonna go to the little girl's room. Girl, where did you get that necklace? It is fabulous. - I don't know, my grandma gave it to me. Ouch! - Oh my God, I'm so sorry. My nail must have got caught in your hair, bye. - You have to go there. It's quite the place. So, aliens and hybrinoids are basically the same thing. Except in the game version the hybrinoids have super human power. I mean, you really have to understand quantum physics to realize how the molecular field is changed in space, allowing for this to happen. - Wait, I thought hybrinoids and aliens were the same thing? - What, no, no, no, no. You obviously haven't been playing this game for very long. I've already invested 82 hours and 17 minutes. I'd say that makes me the table expert here. Unless one of you subterranean Zandoids wants to challenge, the Master? - So if hybrinoids and aliens aren't the same thing does that mean they can't live on Zandar? - I can't believe you make me come to this shit hole every week. How do people listen to this crap? This is a bunch of whiners if you ask me. - Move. - And of all the nights I forgot my damn iPod at the house. - Yeah, well what else are we gonna do in this hick town? Seriously, where else are we gonna play pool? - Well, how do people listen to this backwoods shit? - It's not like we live in Vegas. Okay, sweet, rack 'em up Cowboy. Hey, you wanna go like, smoke or something? - Yeah dude, let's do it. - I'm sick of this shit. - I'm sick of this shit. - Seriously, screw this country music bullshit. - Yeah, screw it. - Everyone here just fucking sucks. - You just fucking suck. - You suck too. - I believe so. - Like, seriously dude. She's a bitch. - Yeah, she's gnarly. - Sarah, your father wants you home now. You give me hit of that, yes? Okay, you go. Get out of here, get out of here. - Wait, stop, we can't, Heather. - Audrey, baby, Heather and I are just together for show. Cheer captain and quarterback. And besides, it doesn't matter. We've practically broken up at this point anyway. - God Tanner, I've had a crush on you for so long. I've been to every single game. - Yeah, so you know that I tend to score. I've got great hands. ♪ All things are built in fire ♪ ♪ tonight ♪ - What? - I can't. - You can't what? - I can't do it like this. I mean, Heather is inside. - And what did I just tell you about Heather and I? We're the ones with something real between us. Are you going to tell me you don't feel the same? And we've both been looking forward to this for so long. It's such a beautiful night. So romantic here under the stars. ♪ I'm living in a masquerade ♪ - I thought I was different - You are different. You are beautiful. - Tanner stop! - Are you fucking kidding me? You're the one that wanted this! - Tanner, I, I just want it to be special. - Special? What do you want, dinner and candlelight? The stars aren't good enough for you? I'm done with you. Get the hell out of my Jeep. Go back to your freak camp. - Asshole! - Bitch, you got black lipstick on my shirt! - Audrey, wait, hey where are you going? Dude, seriously, you can't walk home. Don't let that dickhead fuck with you. - Audrey Lowrey, the biggest cock tease in this fucking town. - Are you happy stud? So lucky I don't have my knives on me tonight. ♪ Tear it out, tread against my will ♪ - There you are babe. I was just coming to find you. - After you made it with that skank? - What, who? - That slut freak. - You thought I'd choose a Goth over you? - Yeah, pretty much anything that would put out. - Babe, come on. I choose you. - A Goth, Tanner, really? - Exactly. Why would I go for the 1/2 dead zombie chick when I've got you? The most beautiful, sweetest, sexiest girl in town. - I am? Of course you are. - Here, let me make it up to you? - Don't fuck up again. - Let's get you home. I've been thinking about you all night and I'm dying to explore what's hiding under that sexy little dress. ♪ So rip it up ♪ ♪ Tear it out, tread again ♪ - Oh my God. Audrey, is that you? Are you okay? - Hi Mr. Henderson. - Are you coming from teen night? That's quite a walk. - Yeah, I needed the fresh air. - Well, can I at least offer you a ride since I almost killed you? - No, but honestly, I really need the walk. - Okay then, see you at school tomorrow. Watch out for the drunks! - Rex is that you? Rex, don't do that to me. Holy shit, what are you doing? Go home, go home. - Audrey, what are you doing out here so late? - Hi Officer Powell. - It's way past curfew. What are you doing out here all alone? - I got ditched at the Pioneer and had to walk. - I'm sorry, are you all right? - Yeah, just a bad night. A stupid guy. - Well, we're not all that bad. He's the one that lost out. - Well, thanks for stopping. This is me. - You get some rest. We'll see you at the festival. - Rex. Holy shit, you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here? - Nice of you to show up. So where's your slut friend? - My slut friend. Right. Your dick of a boyfriend has been trying to nail Audrey for weeks, you know. You're just too caught up in your dumb bimbo squad to notice what's going on. So shut your fucking mouth before I strangle your scrawny little neck. - Yeah, just like a Goth. Well, tell your whore of a friend I'll be looking for her in the hallways later. - Why don't you tell your dick stick to find her? He was the one that sent her running off into the woods last night. - The woods? - He better hope nothing happened to her. - Ohhh, Little Goth Riding Hood alone in the woods. - What? - Your little slut didn't make it back home last night. And you're late. Did you spend the night with her? - What the hell are you talking about Heather? I was on the phone with you until I passed out. - In an open air Jeep no less, classy. - Nothing happened. - Right. - So where is she? - Oh, so you do care about her? - No, I just happen to have-- - You're a douchebag Tanner. - Why do you have to be such an attention whore, Tristan? - If you guys focused on school, as much as you guys focused on gossiping you'd actually be smart. - Calm down. - Hey, hey, hey! Everyone settle down. Thank you, please explain what's going on here. - Okay, well these two bitches here. - Oh these two bitches? - I am not a bitch. You're the bitch. - Stop, well, since you've all shown just how well you get along together, you, you, you, you, you, and you have just been put together on a festival team. - Seriously? - We're already on teams. - Now you're on different teams. You will be getting together. Everyone, pull your books out to chapter six. - Yeah, so now I can't be on the team. - But you were in charge this whole time. - It is just like you to always desert on us. - Well you can thank Gothitude here and her hussy friend. - You're such a, whatever. - Just like Heather. - Super. - Fricking sucks man. - Fuck dude. - You're always just chasing tail. Look where it got you. Damn, we had a real chance of winning this. - I know, I'm sorry. - Bro, you have all your priorities out of whack. You have the hottest chick in school. And one of these days you're just gonna fuck up and lose her. - Oh please, you all know what a piece of ass Audrey Lowery is? - Yeah, well that piece of ass just cost you the competition. - No worries, we got this. - So when are the freaks and geeks supposed to get here? - I think I just heard them pull up. - Hey, we can still win this thing. We just have to work a lot harder. - Hello? - At least they figured out how to use the back door. - Hey Heather. - Seriously? You got more on the floor than you did in your mouth. Stop eating like a pig. 30 second rule! - What do you call yourselves? Your name, do you have one? - You're kidding, right? We have, like, four classes together. Jack, my name's Jack. - And you are? - I'm Brianna, we have Mr. Henderson's class together. I'm friends with Jack. - Yeah. - Hi Tanner, I'm Brianna. - Hello. - It's open. - Rear entry, just what I'd expect from a rich bitch. Oh and look, designer fag. - Oh, this coming from death warmed over. - Fits her. Her life sucks. Her friend's life sucks. So why not make everyone else around her miserable? - I see you took dickless back, good call. - So, did you hear from Audrey? - You mean your brainless forest hussy? - I thought fags were supposed to be sensitive? No, no one has heard from her. - Seriously? Where do you think she is? - Do you even care how you're making me look, here? - A real Mother Teresa. - And the new girl scores! - Trist! - What honey? I didn't know the shy girl had it in her. I call it like I see it. - I mean, maybe something serious did happen. - Seriously, she's probably off screwing someone else's boyfriend. Who cares what happened to her. - Fuck you. - No, you shut your fucking mouth. - Is this how we're supposed to win a race? What was Mr. Henderson thinking, putting us together? - Fuck Henderson. - Okay, I think we all just need to settle down and maybe crack open a bottle of bubbly to celebrate us coming together. - You don't drink, do you? - Look, we have to figure out what we're doing for the festival so we're just gonna have to get along, like it or not. - Not, but if I have to work with you losers, then I might as well be completely shit faced. Anybody got a chaser? - We didn't really know Audrey that well but we had a class together. She seems really nice. Did you call her parents? - Her fucking parents don't give a shit. Seriously, they're out of town all the time on vacation. Like, she's been alone since she was 14. - Here. - No thank you. - Go ahead, give it a try. Just a little sip, little sip sip. - Drink up, it's there. - Do you even drink? - I'm sure she just went to Denver to blow off some steam. I mean, let's be honest, who doesn't get claustrophobic in this small town? - Yeah, maybe. I mean, she has a cousin who lives there. - There you go. - So, how long have you guys been together? - Oh, no, no, we're not together. - Really? But you guys would be so cute. - Okay, okay, can we cut the shit and get focused? With enough of these, maybe we can actually find a way to work together and try to win this thing, who's with me? - I'm in. - Okay then, we need to pick a theme and we need to practice the race. It's my last year. I want that trophy and I want that cash. All right, now that we're on the same page let's pick a theme. - I say we go with sexy vampires. - Yeah, because that's not overdone. - Okay, werewolves. But they have to be sexy werewolves. - Isn't that the same thing? - Anyone have any other ideas? - Warlocks. Warlocks are always good. - Those aren't sexy. - Okay, well how about we just go with hockey masks? Simple and we don't have to wear makeup. - What, no makeup? Nah, that's not gonna work for me honey, sorry. - No, I think it's a great idea. I mean, it's easy and we don't have time to get costumes anyway. - You'd look good in a mask. - Oh, like the transparent one you wear? - Look, we don't have time for this shit, okay. Hockey masks it is. So, who's gonna be in the wheelbarrow? - I've always wanted to be pulled around in a chariot. - Okay, so we're making great headway. What about a wheelbarrow? - Well the rules say we have to build one. - Way ahead of you. I had one built from my previous team. They brought it over this morning. - Black? - It's-- - Super creepy! - Super crappy! - It's not crappy, it's light. The lighter it is, the faster we can push it. - Are you sure it can carry four people in it? It looks too flimsy to me. - It looks like it wouldn't even hold horse manure. What? It doesn't. - What do you want it to look like? - Like a wheelbarrow? - Oh, there's a wheelbarrow outside grandpa's shed. - Well maybe we should go take it. - Seriously? - Shit, why not? Apparently this ain't up to snuff. Maybe we should go steal it. - Wait, why the hell is there a wheelbarrow outside that creepy shed? - Oh, The Body Keepers. They use it to bring in dry ice for grandpa. - Body keepers? - Yeah, since 1993, these people, the keeper's of the bodies, have been changing the dry ice around his coffin to keep him frozen. You know, there used to be two bodies in there. But no one knows what happened to the second one. Legend has it that this guy, grandpa, was frozen in Norway. And not just because he wanted to be brought back to life later. Apparently he was some professor who was trying to re-innervate people. But when he didn't succeed, he started to harvest souls instead. This guy, he became a serial killer. He collected bodies, kids mostly. He figured out a way to extract souls from his victims. The bodies were kept on ice so they wouldn't decay. That way you can move their souls back and forth, any time he wanted to. These people were left in a state of purgatory because this professor guy, he created a living hell on earth for them. - What, that's bullshit! Where did you read this crap? I mean, how could somebody move souls? - I'm just telling you what I read. - Okay, go on Jack. - So, to stop this guy, they cryogenically froze him alive, so that they could freeze his soul, encasing him forever. - You guys actually believe that shit? Come on, everybody knows it's just some old dead guy who wants to be brought back to life someday. - I think Jack's on to something. I say we go. Who wants to go take a look at the dead guy? Steal a wheelbarrow? - I'm in. - Yeah, me too. - This is stupid. - This is a bad idea guys. We can't do this. - Shut the fuck up. - You shut the fuck up Tanner, okay? This is sacrilegious. This kind of shit gets people killed. - Okay then, it's settled. - Now? - Well we can't very well break into a shed during the day, can we? - Well I can't wear this. Come on. - Fuck! - Ahh, this is sick. - Don't they have, like, some sort of security for this? - I don't know. Let's find out. ♪ You know I'm a bad bitch ♪ ♪ And you don't wanna mess with this ♪ ♪ Yeah, cause I'm a bad bitch ♪ ♪ Oh baby ♪ - Best song ever. - You know it girl. - So, where the hell is the wheelbarrow? - Must be inside. - Oh no, no way in. Let's bail. - We're breaking in. - Ah look, one for the geeks. - When did you learn how to pick a lock? - I haven't yet. But I carry this just in case of the Zombie Apocalypse. - Zombie apocalypse? - Everyone knows a zombie can't break through a locked door. Yeah, I read in Zombie Massacre, a Survival's Guide for the Average Teen, that if we just locked all the doors we'd be safe from the zombie apocalypse. But of course, that means if someone were being trapped on the other side of these doors we'd be screwed. So, voila! Zombie survivor gear number one. I got this bad boy from the Zombie Network website. And if you get a pair of goggles along-- - Jack! - Sorry. - So can you pick the lock or not? - Locks are surprisingly easy to pick. You just have to twist this thing until you hear a click. Then you move the tumbler to the side, dammit. - Give me that. - Why am I not surprised? - Prom queens first. - That's it? This piece of shit? Has it always looked like this? - No, originally it was in a much smaller place. They must have moved it after they stopped giving tours. No, stop! That stuff will burn you if you touch it without gloves. - Did somebody say gloves? - There's the wheelbarrow. Now let's get it and get out of here. - Baby, come on, just a peak. Holy shit! - Do you think he's actually in there? - Well, we've come this far. Let's find out. - Oh this ought to be good. - Okay guys, we can't do this. All right, we need to get out of here. This isn't funny anymore. - God will strike us down. You need to change your panties or something, man. - Shut the fuck up Tanner! - Calm down, calm down. We are just gonna take a look and close it back up. - Tanner, please don't. - You asshole, that's not funny! - No, that shit was hilarious. You got us Jack. Well played sir. I applaud you. - I almost peed my pants Jack. That was so mean. - Didn't you guys just see that? - See what? - Something grabbed me and started to pull me in but then it just let go. - Okay, Jack you're just fucking with us. Okay, there's nothing in there. This is bullshit. This is absolute tourist bullshit that the town just made up to try and raise some money. I'm getting the hell out of here. - Trist! - They opened it. - They opened it, make the call. - Little shits. This better be important. - I don't understand why we went there in the first place. That's just so stupid. But you were hilarious. - You scared my school pride, peeing my pants. - Fuck dude, the look on your face was priceless. You should be a fucking actor, man. - Jack, I give you credit. Queen boy here oughta check his delicates. - Whatever, I'm out. I've had enough of this freak show for one night. - Bye, text me when you get home okay? - I will. - Bye guys, drive safe. - Are you okay Jack? - Yeah, I'm fine. Let's get you home. - Jack! - Fuck dude! You look white as a ghost. Well Casper, here, obviously ain't taking you anywhere. I'll give you a ride. - The hell you will. You can't leave me here alone. I'm too tired to go with you. - So what, they're gonna walk? After what happened to Audrey? - Oh all right. You both can stay here. You too, it's late and my brother and parents are in Grand Junction for the weekend. Jack you can take my brother's room. Brianna and Ivy, you guys can have my room. It's the beautiful pink one. Tanner and I will take the master. Come on, I'll show you guys. - Are you okay Jack? - I'm fine, I'll catch up with you guys in a minute. I'm gonna call my mom. Hello, Mom? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just not feeling too well is all. So the team and I decided to stay at Heather's house tonight. Okay, I love you too. Bye. - Um, yeah, you can take the bed. I can't sleep anyways. I think I'll just chill here for a while. - Okay. - Here you go. Jesus, jack you look like shit! - Good, that explains why I feel this way. - Good night. - Good night. - So I'm kind of worried about that geek in my brother's room. - Who, Jack? - Yeah, what are you watching? - What the hell! Is someone there? - Yes, they're coming for you. He will find you. - What are you talking about? - You've been touched. He decays all who he touches. He's coming for you. - Who, who will come for me? - Turn it off. So, I really do wanna talk about Ja--. What was that? - What? - I don't, I think I heard something coming from outside. - I didn't hear anything. - Wait. There it is again. It's coming from under the bed. - Sweetie, you're just a little freaked out. - You must have heard that? - No, nothing. - It's coming from under the bed. - Babe, there's nothing under the bed. - Would you just look? Please? Tanner, there's someone in the bed with you. - Help me. - Stay out of the shed. - The shed, what? - There's dead people in there. They took our souls. Don't let them take yours. - Well don't you just look like a million bucks? - Yeah, I didn't sleep well. Where are the other girls? - Ready to do this shit? - Well look at you. - Keep it in your pants, big boy. Heather's going to be here any minute. - Seriously jock strap. So where's cheer bitch and the geeks? - Oh, speak of the devil. - All right, babe, looking fine as ever. - Where the hell were you last night? - I couldn't sleep, so I went home for a few hours before I had to come back here. Where is Jack? - I think he went home last night too. We drove by his house but no one answered. - Weird. - Yeah, it was a weird night. - Well at least we got the hottest chicks on our team. Tristan, give me a hand. - Let's go. Let's go you guys. I can't do this by myself. - Um, I'm not a guy. - We probably need Jack. Oh my God, she just flipped us off. - Who. - Her. - Hello everyone. Welcome to another year of Halloween Fest. And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. The wheelbarrow races. Here are the rules. Each team must push their wheelbarrow from this goal line to that one and back again. But this year we're gonna mix it up a little bit. Instead of filling the wheelbarrow with dirt we're gonna fill it with one dirt bag. That's right, one member of the team must be in the wheelbarrow at all times. The winning team will receive a check for $2,000 and a beautiful trophy. First team up, Henderson's misfits. - Tanner, the wheel is broken. - Classic, what a piece of shit you built. - I could have built a better wheelbarrow than this out of glitter and a glue gun. - Okay, okay, we'll make it work. Go over there with Heather. - Oh, this is so stupid. - Take your marks. - Ready, set, go! - Great Tanner, your piece of shit creation cut me. - Oh, I ripped your tights. I'm so sorry about that. - Wow, Tristan thanks. - Police suspect foul play. And there are no new leads in this case. Let's hope this, is not another case that goes unsolved. So if you have any information on Audrey Lowrey, please contact the sheriff's department immediately. Back to you Amy. - Come on, I'm sure she's okay. She'll show up. - Ugh, there's nothing to do here. - Hey, a psychic. We should do that. - Welcome, see what the future holds for you. Come on in. - Why not? - Come on in. So, what'll it be this evening? A peek into the future? A Tarot card reading? A palm reading? Or how would you like to speak with the dead? - You can speak with the dead? - I have since I was a child. You know, most clairvoyant's don't realize that they have the gift. They'll be visited by spirits in their dreams. And they won't realize that those dreams are real. So, what'll it be? - My best friend has been missing. She has hasn't been seen or heard from in two days now. Can you tell us what happened to her? - Definitely, I'll give it my best. Give me your hands child. Yes, yes. I see her, a pretty girl. Long blond hair. Yeah, she was last seen with you. And she left alone and hasn't been heard from since. Yeah, Pioneer Inn teen night. Yes, yes, yes, my vision's becoming more clear. I see a river. Danger, darkness, running, fear. She knows who they are. They've taken her. There's more than one. So many children. There's a room full of death. Coldness, ice. - I had a dream last night. Two kids came into my room and told me about the shed. We should have never gone in there. - Trapped, their souls are trapped. He's overtaking their bodies. - Stop! - Are you okay? - Please, please just make her stop. - The dead are disturbed. There's something unnatural going on. You, you are in danger. He is trying to overtake you. He's coming for all of you. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Holy shit, what an act! - Seriously. - Well, how do you think she knew all that stuff? - Okay, so she guessed what Audrey looked like. The rest was just made up. - Well she said we were in danger. What do you think that meant? - Look Bri, you just need to calm down okay? It was all just in fun. - Seriously, it's Halloween. She's supposed to scare us. - Well this calls for a drink. Come on, let's find some soda for this rum. - Wait, Heather and Tanner already left. They're actually at their house waiting for us. And I think it's party time. Topping the news today, two murders and a robbery, in less than 24 hours. Several city citizens were in a panic after a gun battle on some of their busy streets. - Dammit Jack, you're never borrowing my car again. - So you pull a block and follow the instructions. If you crash the tower you have to take two shots. Who wants to go first? - Take off an article of clothing. - This should be good. - Okay, you're gonna have to help me though. It's like, really tight. Pull it off. Right through my little head like we're giving birth. - Okay, take two shots. - That's two. - That's a double shot. - Tanner, you go. He always picks from the top. - Take four shots. - Make them count, no sips. - Ugh! - Kiss the person to your left. - Enough kissing! - That's two more shots for you. - Okay. - Got this. Kiss a girl. Yeah, not happening. - Oh no! - There is a penalty for that. - Definitely. - Pour up. Apologize to the freaks and geeks. They're not so bad. - Tanner, that's so sweet. Now read what it really says. Kiss a guy! - Kiss Tristan, kiss Tristan, kiss Tristan! - Not a chance. - Well come on, he's kind of girly. - Take four more shots. - This one's so full. - Maybe you should see who's on the bottle? - She's out. - All right, this one's a goner. - Don't bother her. She's cute when she sleeps. - We need to get her to bed, come on. - I'll take her to my room. Come on, come on. - Good night Brianna. - You know, I saw footprints in that shed and drag marks next to them. They led to a back room. - No shit? I had a dream about Audrey last night. - And? - I don't know. It was just a dream but it was so real. She was asking for my help. - Help? Shit Tanner, what if it wasn't a dream? What if it was, like, a premonition or something? There's no fucking way Audrey ran away, okay? I know her, she just wouldn't do that. I think, well, I think her disappearance might have something to do with that shed and those drag marks. - Okay then, let's do this. - Hold it. Oh, gotta go. - Wait, Heather's got a camcorder in here somewhere. - Hello? Is someone there? - Jack, where the hell have you been? - Mom? I'm so sorry. They took me. - What? What are you talking about? Who took you? Where are you Jack? - The body keepers, Mom. It's real, it's all real. They took me and they put me in-- - I can't hear you. Where are you Jack? - The body keepers, Mom. The shed. I need help. - Jack, what are you saying? Are you all right? - Mom, I'm tied up. - Jack, Jack? Jack! Jack, Jack! Jack! - 9-1-1, what's the nature of your emergency? - My son, Jack. He's in trouble. He's been taken. I think he might be at the old shed. Please send somebody right now, please. - Three 32 Robert. Need certified at 535 Pine Grove, 535 Pine Grove. - Help me. - Oh my God. Audrey? How did you get here? God, you're hurt, let's get you out of here. - Gi meg din sjel. - What? You're not making any sense. - Gi meg din sjel. Gi meg din sjel! - Hey Ivy, I don't know. Okay, let's do this. - Shit! Tanner, we've got to get back into that shed. Impressive. - Yeah, I always had it in my car. I just didn't wanna make Jack feel bad. Here. Where did you see those footprints? - This way. - What is that smell? - It smells like rotten meat or something. - Oh God. - Please tell me you're getting this. - I'm getting this. - Shit, look at this. - What is all this? It looks like they thawed grandpa out about five years ago. Just about the time they moved him here. It says here, they've been trying to use organ replacements to re, re, rein-- - re-innervate. This is some sick shit. Looks like they were trying to revive grandpa with fresh organs. - Yeah and when that didn't work, it's like they were trying to search for a new way to, soul transformation? - Harvesting souls. - Looks like they've been searching for host bodies to inhabit. Audrey's name is listed here. - This is her necklace. - You're sure? - Yes, I'm sure. She was wearing it at the Pioneer. - Henderson, what is he doing here? - At least it's not Audrey. - Jack, jack, wake up buddy! Jack, wake up, let's get out of here! Come on Jack. What the fuck is going on? - What the fuck? - Oh you silly, silly girl. Grandpa was right. Being the gay BFF made it so easy to collect everyone's DNA. I fucking told you not to go in that shed. If you would have just listened to me none of this would be happening. Now I have to do all this cluster fuck. - You killed Mr. Henderson and Jack, too, didn't you? Why? - Mr. Henderson provided my great grandfather with a great host body, for years. But his body became riddled with cancer. You see, diseased bodies reject the soul. - So Audrey was the perfect specimen? You sick fuck, you're dead! - No one else should have been involved. - What about Jack? - He got in the way. - What did you do to Jack? - He touched my farfar. He doesn't like his body to be disturbed. So, he was eliminated. You people treat my great grandfather like he's some sort of freak show. He was a brilliant man. Well worth the cost of a few useless lives. - I'll show you useless lives. No, please stop! No, no please stop! - You love death so much, Ivy. Well, guess what? Now you get to experience it firsthand. - Let her go. - Naughty boy, would you care to watch? No wait, we know you would. - You've fucking lost it, you sick son of a bitch. - No, I found it. So shut up because it's too late. You see, farfar realized that the only way to keep his own body alive was through blood transfusion with genetically matching blood. It seems Goth girl here's the perfect match. The irony is, your poorly constructed wheelbarrow cut her, giving me the perfect sample. And not only that but you brought her to our doorstep. So you see Tanner, in the end of things you are the hero. Now this, you're gonna wanna see. You wanted to see my grandfather so bad? Well now I guess all that's left to show you is what re-innervation looks like. - Now comes the fun part. - Now then, over here on my little table I have several knives. Don't worry, I keep their edges extremely sharp. You like knives, don't you Ivy? You won't feel the initial incision but you might feel a little pain from the blood loss. - Stop, Tristan, please! - I'm sorry Tanner. I wasn't asking you. Why are you so scared Ivy? Don't you like blood? Don't worry babe. This is a bloodletting tube. So just do me a favor, sit still. - Freeze, don't move! They're taking off! Call for back up. - Requesting backup, 575 Hidden Trail Road at the old shed. - 10-4, all units be advised, we have a pursuit in progress. All units on non essential call are directed to clear and standby to assist. - You stay here. He's gone. - All right Miss McCoy. Walk me through what happened last night. And when you found Brianna Miller dead in your bathroom. - We were drinking last night. And she had a lot to drink so I put her to bed. When I woke up this morning everybody was gone, so I went to check on her. I thought she was passed out but, or at least I thought she was. But she wasn't breathing and I didn't know what to do. So I called you guys-- - Okay, calm down. We found your boyfriend, Tanner. - Well can I see him? Where was he? - No, just sit down. We need to know when exactly you all broke into that shed. We found several dead bodies in that shed. We need to know exactly when you entered that shed. - We were just going in there for a wheelbarrow, that's all. There were no, we didn't see any dead bodies. - What's your relationship with Tristan Swensen? - He's my best friend. Where is he? - He's missing. And so is the body of his dead grandfather. - His grandfather? - Have a seat. We need to show you both something. We need to know if either one of you recognize any of the teens on this video. - Help me, help me! - Help me. - Well, the boy in this video is Craig Westerman. He's been missing for almost two years now. Did either of you recognize any of the other teens on this video? No, okay. Tell us what you know about this shed. - Ivy and I, we went back to the shed after we broke in the first night. We were looking for Audrey Lowrey. That's where we found Jack, and Mr. Henderson, and that room with everything else. The jars, the body parts, and they kept saying body keepers, they kept saying body keepers, body keepers-- - Whoa, slow down son. Tell me about Jack. - We found him dead. Slumped over in that chair. He'd been missing since Friday night. - And Mr. Henderson? - I don't know how he got in the shed. - Well, we do. Seems this operation's been going on for some time now. It turns out Tristan Swensen is the great grandson of grandpa Swensen. When the family moved him here years ago they tried to bring him back to life. And they've been running a type of butcher shop out of that shed, ever since. We found several bodies in there, including the two missing children from Eldora. The other's we haven't identified yet.
