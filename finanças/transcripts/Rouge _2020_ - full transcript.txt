Nour, what happened? Nour? Tell us what happened to her. Nour? Ready? One, two, three... Show her out, she's in shock. Go on, we've got this. Take the gurney too. Prepare for intubation. Get her on the monitor. Can you hear me? Madam? No response. Check her vitals. Prepare to intubate. Nour! Hey. Victor, open up! Just push it. Nice to meet you. This is Victor. - Nour, right? - Yes. Victor will get your union card too. - No union for me. - What? Just kidding! Scared you. Take a picture of us at the plant. - No, Dad! - C'mon! C'mon. The cafeteria's there, remember? The locker rooms... and the union office. Hey, Steph. And look who's in here. Hello? Come give me a kiss! - How are you? - Good, you? Human Resources. Hi, guys. That's accounting, and this is the director's office. Mr. Perez? Miss Hamadi, the prodigal child! - Nice to have you. - Thanks for the job. You should thank your father. I hope you'll be happy here. - I'll let you settle in. - Thanks. It's way in the back. Nice and calm at least. Here it is. I'll let you settle in. See you at the cafeteria. See you later. Your room's a mess. I know, I need to unpack. Give me that. Did you expect to be forever in pink Crocs, wiping old asses? I liked it there. ER was my thing. And my crocs were green. I'm just thrilled to see your face, little sis! I'm so glad you came back. C'mon. Dad made you a dinner worthy of Top Chef. Don't leave me alone in there, please! - Paulo and I will play. - At the wedding. We're ready, right? If your dad wants to. - We'll be ready. - Sure. Depending on the mood. We'll rattle off 3 or 4 tunes! That many! - Then we'll let rip, Paulo. - I'm in. The band should play first. - Then, depending... - You guys should play first. No, cut it out! - Did you like it, pumpkin? - Delicious. "Are you happy, pumpkin?" - "And you, kitten?" - Stop it! Kitten! Kitten! - It's a surprise. - Let's just give them a sneak preview. - Wait. - Don't worry. One, two, three, four... It'll be beautiful, honey. - Kitten, you look a bit stiff. - Shut up! Will you lead? I'll try! Wow, Dad's a good dancer! See, Greg? Slim's doing all the work! So beautiful. I'm leading now. No, liar! ...22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. I stop at 30. I put my hand on the forehead, tip the head back, open the mouth... and blow. There. I put notes in their lockers. They all said they'd come. But no one did. They were being nice to Slim's kid. They don't care about CPR. You expect laborers to suck on a mannequin? So why am I here? Next time I'll make them come. Notes in lockers! Dad! Your mask! - Your masks, guys. - No biggie. Dad! Yeah? - I've got more. - Bring 'em over. There we go. We'll double them up. One next to the other. - There. - Nice. Give me another one. Careful. - Hang on. - Got it. Awesome! - Fuck the fascists. - One more? They're eating out of his hands. It's not his daughter's wedding. Just be cool like this, for Sofia. See how calm he is? He sure is. A real class act. Your speech will be great, Dad. - Thanks, hon. - He looks like you. Slimane Obama! Want me to come with you tomorrow? No, it's ok. Are you sure? I can take the day off. Don't worry, I'll be fine. I was pushing the gurney when I got called away for the child accident victim. His life was in danger. So... I set the brake on the gurney. The patient was lying down. She was tired, but I spoke to her. She spoke normally. So you left her alone here? Yes. But she'd been seen by a doctor. He said her condition was stable. When her condition worsened, she was treated. Two hours later. Because she was left in the hallway. We had 5 other emergencies. Ms. Hamadi handled the priority, as her job requires. We're sorry, but if we had more staff... Stop using that excuse. - We see 50 emergencies in 5 hours... - We're here to evaluate this case! My client needs to know if you did your job right or not. I did all I could. Ok, you can get dressed. Did the prior nurse run tests on you? No, but he was nice. Being a nurse here is pretty relaxed. - Nobody bugs you. - I'm not here to relax. You haven't seen the occupational doctor in 15 years! "Exercise, don't smoke or drink, "stop eating bread, sugar and fat..." "Stop living to stay alive." Does your breathing feel labored? I told you, I can't smell anymore. I'm talking about your lungs. - Does the left side hurt? - Cut it out, Nour. I came to humor you. I'm used to it, I don't care. I'll put you down to see the doctor Thursday at 2 pm. He'll run additional tests. It's important. Promise me you'll go, ok? - You wear me out. - Here. You're like your dad. Always giving orders. Hello? Hello. This is Nour Hamadi. I took over your job at the plant. Right, Slim's daughter. How's it going? Good, great. I'm calling about Paulo Gonçalves who works in the cafeteria. Apparently he hasn't been seen by us since 2004. Maybe. I didn't note down every consultation. And the computer files? I never got the hang of that! But don't worry, it's up to date. I gotta go, I'm driving. Someone's tired! Shit. Asshole. What's this? - What's this? - What? Don't mess with me. You're messing with us. Putting up Green Party posters. Will those assholes grant our dumping rights? Will they save our jobs? See if the workers vote for you next time. Asshole. Fight back, Slim. All you talk about is merging your electoral lists... That's why we're here. To renew local politics, get people involved. No, we're here to discuss ideas and brainstorm, not to sign up on lists. But we must start establishing local electoral lists that better represent the people. By supporting the Arkalu plant, are you protecting the people? Excuse me? Arkalu dumps its waste in the nature reserve right nearby. Their dumping rights are up for extension. Similar factories have polluted India, - Malaysia, Hungary... - What are you on about? You're totally off-topic. Someone has to mention it. City Hall never does. And the Arkalu website is inaccessible to the public. - Listen... - If Arkalu pollutes, don't we have a right to know, Mr. Green-Party councilor? Listen, I'm studying this case very closely. But we must let the commission finish running their tests. If the prefecture decides to extend the dumping rights, I'll accept their decision. You know the State protects Big Industry. No. You're making baseless accusations. We have the extreme Right, the extreme Left... You want us to be the extreme Greens? Please. Any danger must be stopped. Stop this nonsense. You're out of line. This is heavy industry, a ranked chemical plant. Not some DIY lab. We run extensive tests and conform to standards. - This isn't China or North Korea. - Can we see the results? Get elected and you can! I'm a journalist. Yeah? Who for? - I'm freelance. - Right! So you have 2 readers? They don't need chemical analysis charts! You're wrong. Politicians protecting the plant to get votes make headlines! No, please. I can't let you say that. Just tell us. Does the plant pollute or not? Listen up! I've worked there for 29 years. They just hired my daughter. She and her sister grew up right by the plant. If I suspected danger of any kind, would I have kept quiet? You know, miss, my father worked there too. We now have 214 employees and their families. That means schools, libraries and businesses. If Arkalu meets the criteria, their rights must be extended. Bravo! We're citizens of this town. We have a right to know. Can the town be bought? This is neither the time nor the place! Calm down. Let's move on. Hey, Mr. Delhors. You know you can't get elected without our workers. We'll put up your posters. But you're gonna have to take risks. - You can count on me. - No, listen... You don't seem to understand. The plant is in danger. Many workers don't trust the Greens. But they trust the fascists, who woo them daily with empty promises. Nobody here wants an extreme Right councilor, understand? C'mon, hon. Let me through, please. What happened? - What's your name? - Karim. You'll be ok, Karim. He got burned. Breathe. - I'm applying compresses. - My eyes are glued shut! The medics are coming. - It burns! - I'm rinsing your arm with water. It stings, I know. That's normal. Don't worry. It's just water. Breathe. Good. Lift your head. We're taking care of you. Good job. You ok, hon? Been here all day? You don't have to stay, they're on it. Have you seen him? No, they're removing skin from his forearms. How bad is it? His arms will be ok, but it got in his eyes too. He was using cheap plastic goggles. The temps use those. All the workers need proper protective eyewear! How long will he be on disability? - Ask the doctors. - They must've told you. How long? 2 or 3 months, I think. Ok. I expected worse. We won't declare the accident. What? That's impossible. No, honey. We can't have occupational medicine on our back. Not with the inspection coming up. That's not ok, Dad. No way. What's not ok is some incompetent temp bringing the plant down. Trust me. This accident never happened. We'll take care of him. You'll nurse him at home. We'll count it as work time. Coffee? I'll go get some. If a guy got burned at your school, you'd say nothing? Who cares? You don't report it? Dad's been working there 30 years. He knows his job. I know my job too! What'd the temp say? Is he doing better? He'll be ok, but that's not the point. What is the point? Why get involved? Greg! Steph, give Inès a turn, she's been waiting forever! They always ignore the girls! I know you mean well. But you just started working there. Let them handle it. Hi sweetie, how are you? - Hey there. - Hi. - Come in. - Thanks. How are your eyes? Better. They sting less. I use the drops. Another week of resting them, and you should be alright. You work permanently at the plant? Yes, I'm an employee there. If you see the workers' rep, Slimane, tell him we really appreciate the money and everything. Ok, I'll... I'll tell him. He was so great. He even gave our girl a present. Turn your arm over for me. Thanks. Hi. Hi. You still write like a star pupil. I went to see Karim. The temp. - So how's he doing? - Better. Yeah? - They thank you for helping them. - Great. That was quick. Perez was on the case this time. What with the pressure he's under... Usually these things take forever. Usually? So this is standard procedure? - Accidents go unreported? - No. Perez is your pal. You cut a deal? No, Perez is not my pal. We work together, but we don't hang out or pal around. He's not my pal. Why? No reason. So this is my job? Handling what's not up to spec? Settle down. Tell me what else I need to know. - I'm just trying to understand. - Understand what? Want my job? Seriously, take my job! C'mon. Sit right here, honey. Prepare for the inspectors coming to fuck with the plant! - Workers, budgets, safety... - I know it's tense. Then why are you on my back? Not happy I got you a job? Nour... May I? You ok? I'm sorry we argued. I'm glad you're here. It's good. It's good for me. This one. - This one's fine... - Nour! - What? - The inspectors! - Our nurse, Ms. Hamadi! - Mr. Perez, hello. We have medical staff on site at all times to monitor our employees' health and develop meaningful risk prevention strategies. Thank you for your time. Let's go see the loading zone. Goodbye. Thank you. Naturally, all of our employees get CPR training and have annual consultations with the occupational doctor. - Paulo? - Hey doc! How's it going? Why'd you miss your appointment? - Stop that nonsense! - I'm serious. You need to see the doctor. Don't worry. I'm on you. The kid buggin' you? Slim's daughter? You're Slim's daughter? Bug this guy too. He never sees the doctor. I sure don't. I don't trust those guys. When they closed the lake, they wanted to declare our crew unfit for work so they could fire us. Luckily your dad fought to keep us. He pushed them to transfer us here. - You were at the lake too? - What a newbie! All of us here were at the lake! Abdou and Kader were, too. They're janitors now. Your dad ensured our future. Yep. The kitchen is our early retirement! Hello? This is Nour Hamadi. I'm calling back about Paulo Gonçalves. Why was there no follow-up? He has anosmia and breathing difficulties... I don't remember. I don't know every case by heart. Right, but prior to that he was seen annually. He worked outside the plant, at a site called The Lake. Right, the former dumping grounds. It's been closed for years. Temps do the dumping now. Why are you involved? If you have questions, ask your father. Goodbye. No, I... I have no files for you. Does your temp agency monitor your health? - Who's your team leader? - It was Karim. - Karim is a temp. - So? He ran our team. We're glad you're his nurse. He's cool. Should've made him use eyewear! - He did. - It wasn't the right eyewear. The gloves were wrong too. - That's what they gave us. - Gloves are a hassle. It takes twice as long to shut the valves. When pipes leak, time is tight. If the alarm goes off, the engineer comes. More time lost. You get yelled at, and the agency stops calling you. What comes out of the pipes? No idea, we're not engineers. You don't know what's in them? Whatever they're dumping, it's inert. What does inert mean? That it's not toxic? It means it's inert. - Can you show me? - We're not allowed. Ask the higher-ups. They're under a lot of pressure with the inspection. They're verifying every day. Bye. ...Hungarian ecologists. On the banks of the Danube 60km north of Budapest, over 6 million tons of red soil is stocked from communist-era alumina production. The sludge contains toxic heavy metals. This ecologist is checking for pollution by infiltration and many other problems. Authorization to experiment on the red soil to see if the waste can be treated has been granted... If dust from the red soil spreads... Don't forget we're doing Sofia's wedding menu tomorrow. It's a chemical plant, of course it's not clean. But it adheres to the standards. It's legal. Perez is strict about that. Perez says what suits him. - Ever been to the lake? - That was 20 years ago. Was the waste dumped there toxic? Are you kidding? 50 tests were done on the lake. And the injured temp? You're confusing things. He was burnt by lye in the waste. Let me explain. When liquid lye meets co2, it turns into dirt, ok? It's inert. No danger. - Nothing else in it? - Nothing. - Do my laces, please. - Seriously? Please, I'll rip the suit! C'mon. C'mon, no biggie. You worry too much, Nour. - Did the meeting upset you? - Other foot. The Greens don't understand the plant. And closing won't change a thing. Americans won't start riding bikes. Russians won't stop drilling for oil in Siberia. We're tiny in this. Closing won't change a thing. Get it? It doesn't matter. So, how do I look? Great. - What do you think? - Perfect. When I'm the boss I'll hire you to iron my shirts. Dummy! Nour? - Emma. - Hi. Strange to meet in a bowling alley. I'd rather no one see us, ma'am. Drop the ma'am. You wanted to talk about something? At the meeting you said there's a problem with the plant. With the waste. What exactly is the problem? Excuse me? What information do you have? Hang on. Did they send you? No. They send their nice little nurse to investigate me. - Not at all, far from it. - Then what? I saw your website, the articles, documents, photos... So I reached out. I... I wonder what's going on, I... It's hard to get information. That alone suggests wrongdoing. The inspectors have full access. Won't they uncover any problems? No. The inspection is a formality. Even if they find something, we'll never know. The parent company has a dozen plants in the region, and political ties. The authorization will be renewed for sure. Been working there long? I only just started, but... my whole family works there. That explains a lot. So you know the plant well? If you're worried, maybe you can find out where the waste is going. It used to be the lake. Now we know it goes into quarries at the reserve, but where? No idea. I know it's a secured area, but I don't have access. I've heard about the lake. Heard about it? Never seen it? - Are you sure about this? - Don't worry. What does "protected zone" mean? Nothing. The village was deserted 15 years ago. I remember my dad saying, "I'm going to the lake. "To see the guys." They dumped out here in nature for over 50 years. The site is just about perfect. Hidden behind trees, no nearby roads... No one gave a shit. It must've been authorized? It's clearly toxic. Look at the vegetation. That was before. Maybe it's better now, maybe the waste is clean. No, nothing's been done. They haven't invested, I checked. And why use quarries if it's clean now? They purchased old cement quarries for 1 symbolic euro. They dump it 300 meters below. No one stops them. Why not, if it's toxic? Asbestos took 40 years. - That's different. - It's exactly the same. - I know this is hard for you. - Can we go? Soso... Soso, my baby, my little girl... you're getting married. Your life will go on without us. Before you fly away, I want to tell you how proud I am of the woman you've become. And that thief stealing you away? I love him like a son. My dear, beloved Sofia, I see your mother's eyes in yours. You've already given me the best gift, my granddaughter Zoé. She brings back the memory of your tiny hand in mine. Your unrelenting smile and good humor always calm my anger. My dear Sofia, I admire your sweet presence and determined energy. You carried me through the storm that devastated us. But we all made it out more united than ever. You're leaving, and I'm happy, despite my pain, to tell you, my love, my baby, my daughter... I love you. There. I didn't hold back. - It's beautiful. - Yeah? I'll learn it by heart. It couldn't wait for our weekly meeting? It's about a team at the plant. They were monitored until 2004. I did a quick summary. There are cases of chronic bronchitis, respiratory illnesses, 12 pulmonary infections - and 2 cancers. - Listen. You're new to occupational medicine. Factory workers are 10 times more likely to die of cancer. That's just the sad truth. And it's complex. Workers may smoke, have a family history of cancer or mold in their basement. I know it's hard to determine causality, but it's clear that... No, it's not clear. You're a nurse, not a pulmonologist. Sure, but these workers are sick. We can't pretend they're not. At the cafeteria, they're no longer exposed. Monitoring is not mandatory. We can't force them to consult. For those still working, could we run some tests urgently? - Urgently? - Yes. Leave it here, I'll take a look. Thanks. Nour! Come. Come, please. - Can't you mind your business? - It is my business! It's my job, it's why I'm here. All the guys who worked at the lake are sick! Think this is a jewelry shop? Look! This is where we work, honey. So? Is it normal to be sick? I should look the other way? Sit by while you all die? - Nonsense. - Seriously! If it was so toxic we'd all be dead now. The plant is our bread and butter, you know that! Dogs don't bite the hand that feeds. I'm not a dog, Dad. Ms. Hamadi, do you know who pays your salary? Who finances the tests you requested? I'm responsible for my employees' health. If the inspectors catch wind of this, imagine the consequences. I verified the files before requesting tests. What did you verify? You aren't qualified. My wife teaches French, she'll teach you to write. We're all here to solve a problem. But be polite. I know what I'm saying. The men who worked at the lake... Right, in the 1990s. We obviously know all that. It's unfortunate. Conditions were different back then. Workers got exposed. You weren't even born. You treat waste differently now? We no longer have any problems. The director of the nature reserve is even on our supervisory board. Does that reassure you? Your father and I will overlook your misguided enthusiasm. The employees will be tested, in good time. But stop making these mistakes. I'm trusting you. - So I... - Thank you. He's lying. He's lying, Dad. Nothing's changed in 20 years. The plant makes it the same way, so it pollutes the same way! You always complain that they don't invest enough. Look at that uniform. You had it when I was in high school. That's different. Dad, they get so much public money, but never change a thing! Stop it, honey. Treat the scrapes, put up posters, but don't sabotage my job. We left anyway. Took the caravan, the kids and everything we could. But it was too late. Six months later, my husband... was dead and buried. Did experts confirm it was linked to the plant? What else could it be? We saw specialists, they told us. Aggressive cancer at 29 is not normal! But we don't have concrete proof. They did quick tests at our houses. See? Their calculations are all wrong. They said we didn't really live there, we were only exposed part-time. - Was your health monitored? - Hardly! I got a blood test 2 years ago for an infection and shortness of breath. Seeing the results, the doc asked if I worked in heavy industry. Heavy industry, me? I was a park ranger! What made you leave so fast? We got a letter from the mayor's office. "Stop drinking from the tap, avoid the river, stop gardening." No details, no explanations. Did they propose compensation? Not a penny. They denied the pollution. But at night, they went house to house offering everyone various sums so we'd leave. Not much, just enough to make us fight. City Hall did nothing. We didn't take their crap lying down. We sued them. We knew nothing. We learned about legal proceedings, illnesses, chemical processes... - So what happened? - Nothing. We ran out of money for the lawyers. End of story. My dad knows all this. Not necessarily, not in detail. Yes he does. - He sees things differently. - Yeah? But he doesn't see them? They're invisible? They're hidden behind his big fat plant. You can see things your own way. You came today for a reason. In any case, you're not betraying your colleagues. You're helping them. The case is very compelling, but there's no proof. An injured temp was paid off. Sick workers were transferred. Talk about a cover-up! That's not proof. Is your source credible? Of course. She's reading the article now. Chill, we'll publish. We can't bury this! Settle down. Just reword a few things. We'll only publish what we're sure about. Ok? The article is a conditional warning, not a condemnation. Can you keep investigating? - Sure, I'm still mining my source. - Good. When you have more, we'll do a feature and a podcast. Ok, I'll rework it and send it to you. Bye. What do you think? Planning to mine me for long? - It's just an expression. - But it says it all. I'm not at your service. It's already super hard... - I know it's hard. - No, you don't. "Health Scandal at Arkalu" Good headline. Why add "An Employee Talks?" It gives the article credibility and weight. They'll all know it's me. They will anyway. The temp, the medical files... it all leads back to you. I'd rather you don't put it. It won't matter. Maybe not, but still. Ok. Thanks. The article's great otherwise. The personal accounts, the video of the lake... Very well done. I'll be going. I'm no use anymore. Wait, Nour. Thanks for everything. Hey, you! I love you. Got a light? I didn't want to discuss it tonight. The others don't know yet. I saw Perez this morning. We'll try to suppress that shit you two wrote. I don't get you anymore. What was I supposed to do? You should be the one doing it. Fighting. For your coworkers' health. Keeping them safe. From Perez, and from the plant itself. You knew what happened to them. You stood by while the people at the lake were poisoned. That reporter manipulated you. - Dad, I won't close my eyes. - She wanted a scoop! She doesn't give a damn about you. Or about us! The plant will close and she'll move on. How could you betray me like this? - On your sister's wedding day? - It's perfect. All your coworkers are here. All united. Let's tell them, "Thanks to Slim, your job is safe, "but you'll die before you retire." And you'll say, "If I hired my daughter, the plant is clean!" - Shut up. - You strut around. I've fought for years! 4 new owners, 4 times we saved the plant! We all want new machines, good filters, clean waste and all. But that's not how it works. We get the crumbs. Now some ecologist wants to save woodchucks. I don't give a shit about woodchucks. I want to save my coworkers, their families, their jobs. You act strong, but you're so naive. - You don't get it. - Yes I do. I totally get it. You're lying to us. You have been for years. Your plant is disgusting. Keep fighting to keep your stupid badge. Your stupid salary and your stupid year-end gift basket! Don't change a thing! We'll talk about it at Paulo's funeral. How can you utter such trash? You weren't so clever when you forgot that old lady in ER. Don't ruin your sister's wedding. This is all I've got. Will it be ok? You think you're clever. "I'm a strong woman, I make radical decisions." But you've dropped the ball. I'm fighting in a different way, ok? So I can sleep at night. Are you angling for another Seveso? Who's talking about that? It's totally different. Those Arkalu bastards are the same as at Montedison. Except the Corsicans bypassed legislation to stop them. They blew up the boats. End of story. No more sludge. But this is long-term pollution, as my article says. Yeah, your awesome article. Your readers will discuss it around their fire pits. You're such a jerk. Not agreeing doesn't make me a jerk! Meanwhile that plant keeps killing. Words won't smash Big Industry. We gotta take action. - Great. - Is it dangerous? Yes. Must it be stopped? Yes. Is there a political solution? No. Are you serious, JB? Your revolution is too bourgeois. Fuck you! Nour, meet JB, the father of my child. Nour works at Arkalu. Swell. Fuck, Emma... - Sorry. - No I am, I didn't mean to... Don't be sorry. It's his fault. He just came to get some things. Cup of tea? Sure. Did you manage to sleep? What's all that? The article. The comments. It's going viral. All thanks to you. Dad 3 missed calls Where are you? Fire at the factory National Police. Keep moving, please. You can't stay here, ma'am. Keep moving. You're here? I spent the night at the plant. I'm not behind the fire. I had nothing to do with it. I know. Nour, where are you going? Hi, honey. Soso? What do you want? Got a minute so I can explain? Explain what? - See what your friends did? - They're not my friends. Do you realize the trouble you've caused? I'm sorry, I... Sorry means nothing. Greg is coming down. - He's ballistic. - How can he not understand? Has he ever told you the truth? You wreak havoc wherever you go! Shit. 3 colleagues are hospitalized. You plotted against us from the start. The plant is closed for 2 days. We've been furloughed. Happy now? Your big mouth will cost us everything. Everything! Come in. White lead or arsenic? According to the article in Climax, Arkalu allegedly dumps large quantities of both in quarries in a nearby nature reserve. The plant is currently under inspection. The results will be published soon. Will their dumping rights be extended 10 more years? No one has claimed responsibility for the arson, but environmental groups have come out against Arkalu since Climax posted their revelations. Any day now, the prefecture could extend the rights. We have to go over their heads. The decision has to become political, go up to the minister. We can only take action with you if there's concrete proof that they're lying about the toxicity. I've been researching for weeks... The plant and the prefecture will never cooperate. Take over, if you're so clever. Set off fireworks like you did for the nuclear plant. Seriously, why don't you? So... - You won't do anything? - It's up to you. Whistleblowers are rare. I'm not a whistleblower. It's up to you guys now. No, like I said, we can only act if there's concrete proof of pollution. We can help you logistically. But the real question is, can you get samples of the waste they dump? I'm supposed to steal samples? It wouldn't be stealing. As an employee, you have the right to report a public health risk in the context of your job. I will not rob the plant. - It's heavily guarded. - There's no other way. They're right, without proof we're sunk. I know, but it's impossible. - There must be a way. - I'm telling you, it's off-limits. I'd do it myself if I weren't pregnant. Dammit Emma, I'm losing my whole family right now. This isn't just some plant to me. I'm not just chasing a scoop for my newspaper. Is that what you think? I'm just chasing a scoop? - I don't care about you? - I don't know why you're doing it! - This isn't what reporters do. - Yeah? Then what do we do? I'm doing it because if we don't, nobody will. I'm doing this for my baby. For your father. He's like the others. Silent for years, afraid of repercussions, unemployment. Trust me. If you do nothing and he dies young, you'll regret it. Here's a waterproof bag. You'll find a place to access the waste. The question is, what will you find? Follow the procedure carefully. Collect it as cleanly as you can. Try to fill all of these, ok? Get it pure. Screw the lids on tight. Look. A list of pathologies. Out of these 23 employees, 2 even have cancer. This is disgusting. Think you could get samples of the waste? Why? - To find out what it is. - Why do you care? It keeps me awake at night. My dad and brother-in-law work there. Look at your arms. Don't you wonder if they're poisoning us? - I'll never go back there. - No one's asking you to. Then how? Maybe you could ask one of the guys you worked with. No way. They won't risk losing their jobs. Where do the engineers take samples? Don't be crazy. There are cameras. - You need a special badge. - I'll have one. Where is it? - It takes strength to open the valve. - Don't worry. Where is it? Good evening, everyone. Thank you so much. And thanks to our communication team for organizing this wonderful event so quickly. So... this is Arkalu. It's a subsidiary of world-leader Unicom. And it's you, your hard work, your commitment. Thank you. Are you ready? I'm ready. Thank you for coming tonight. We're prepared to fight, all together, for the future of the plant. Even at night, if we must, with extinguishers and water buckets! And now, live from Vancouver, please welcome Vijay Singh, President of Unicom. We decided yesterday with the board to invest in your plant starting next year. Life is winning, thanks to you. Thanks to local officials like Ms. Renzoni, thanks to Mr. Perez. Thanks to all of our efforts, your region will grow and thrive toward a bright future. Finally some good news. Arkalu's efforts at transparence have convinced the prefecture. The plant will go on. Our town will survive. Thank you so much. Good evening. I don't know if I can speak for all the employees. We've all made huge sacrifices these past few years. So I just want to say, guys... it's good to see us all still here tonight. Thank you, we understand. Stop! Nour! Stop! Nour, please come back. Come back now. She's burnt, don't touch her. What is it, Jeff? What? What the fuck was she doing there? I was at the conference! Victor, open up! Open up! Slim, Slim! Where is she? - Where is she? - I don't get it! How'd she access the waste zone? I have no idea, I don't get it either. Where's your badge? Your daughter will not get away with this, or the fire! - She wasn't involved in the fire. - Wake up, Hamadi! She had professional material to take samples! She didn't act alone, she's working with some sort of group. You don't know your own daughter. Can't you see I fight every day to save the plant? And you hire a little shit who breaks in to bring us down! How could you be so stupid? Calm down! Let him go! I've worked here 30 years! This is my home! This is my home! You're not the one shoveling dirt into the ovens day and night! You're not alone, there's 223 of us! Your daughter burned her face. The medics took her to the hospital. - No, sir! - My daughter's in there. You can't see her. - My daughter... - Calm down, sir. Sir. - Why can't I? - I can't let you. - Where are the doctors? - That way. Happy now? - Get what you wanted, bitch? - Out you go! I'm sorry about your daughter. Are you fucking kidding me? You got your victim, a great story! - Nour did what she felt was right. - According to who? She's paying for your friends. No one should pay for that plant. Not her, not you, not your colleagues. Not the locals. No one! Within 7 years it'll be sold and relocated overseas. You'll have lost everything. And your home town will be polluted for centuries. What could we do? Is it our fault? We'd all like it to be clean. Yeah? History will remember otherwise. You'll come across as... the boss's minions. Aging laborers afraid to let go. And you know it. It takes politicians and money to stop pollution. The leaders must be pressured. No choice but to act. The truth has to come out. And Nour found it. She found the truth. To save the workers. To save you, her dad. Because you lied to her. You should've told her the truth. What could I have done? We have no right to speak out. RISK ASSESSMENT An Arkalu employee got the case reopened by giving the press confidential documents... ...heavy metals and above-average radioactivity levels, even though the prefecture approved the dumping... Anne Sylvain turned in this damning report. Witnesses are testifying. You're following the red soil case closely... The waste is loaded with heavy metals and radiation... If toxicity is proven, this is a scandal of national proportions. The Minister of Ecological Transition is about to make a statement. based on actual events RED SOIL Subtitles by Sionann O'Neill Subtitling: Média Solution
