Set free! Set free! Moon Shining high above Upon Parisian roofs See How a man can suffer from love Bright Solitary star Fading away With the coming of day Hear Rising up to you the song of the earth Listen to the cry Of a man in pain For whom A million stars Mean nothing compared To the eyes of the one He loves A deadly love Moon Moon Shining high above Before The break of day Hear The howling heart of the human beast lt's the plaint Of Quasimodo Who cries ln mad despair His voice Up hill and down dale Flies up To you Moon! Watch Over this strange world That joins lts voice with choirs of angels Moon Shining high above To Shed your light upon my pen See How a man can suffer from love Love l leave you a whistle so you can call me During the day, you must stay here but you can walk at night On the roofs of the cathedral under the stars You don't hear me you're already asleep lt's a nasty world out there You're beautiful when you sleep ln your sleep Esmeralda Are you dreaming of your sun? God this world is unfair he's so handsome and l'm so ugly Even if l gave you the moon you'd still refuse to love me And he, without making a move without a word or a glance And he, without making a move without a word or a glance Put some tenderness into your big black eyes You'll give yourself to him and believe all of his oaths You love him for his stature without looking at what's inside God this world is unfair he a lord and l a lout He'll give you the moon when you've asked for nothing God this world is unfair go love your shining knight The satin of your dark skin is not made for tramps My ugliness is an insult to your brazen beauty An error of mother nature's didn't grant me any favors God this world is unfair our fate is not theirs We don't have a fortune but them, do they have hearts? They're born into lace to make love and war But we poor earthworms our lives are filled with beauty And on which side is God on the side of monstrances Or on the side of those who pray morning and night This Jesus that we so adore has He always preferred The three wise men and their gold above us poor shepherds? God this life is cruel for two searching hearts l so ugly and you so fair how could you possibly love me? The night is so lovely And l am so lonely l don't want to die l want to sing again to dance and laugh l don't want to die Die Before having loved To live For the one you love Love More than the love itself To give Without expectation Free To choose how you live Without excommunication Without interdictions Free Without a God or a country The only baptism The rain that falls from the sky To live For the one you love Love More than the love itself To give Without expectation The two worlds that now separate us One day will unite Oh! l'd love to believe it Even at the cost of my life l'd give my life To change history To live For the one you love Love More than the love itself To give Without expectation Love Like the night loves the day Love Until you die of love Until you die of love Asylum!
