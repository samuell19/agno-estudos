(bright music) (gentle music) - "So how do you feel about opening the Chase "in the summer," says he. "Well, whatever your pleasure, Mr. Smythe," says I. "Will you be wanting the west wing or the east?" "Oh, the entire house," says he. Americans are coming, no less. (ax creaks) "Oh, it'll be wonderful to see the place alive again," says he. "Oh, it will, it will," replies myself. All 63 rooms, wonderful! - Ma'am. - Aggie. You're not thinking you're finished now, are you? - Well, I'm finished downstairs, ma'am. - Upstairs. - Upstairs? Alone? - March. (gentle music) Go on. (gentle music) (clears throat) Your tea, sir. - Ah, Mrs. Umney. So very kind. Quite a family history. As a barrister, I've read a great many, but never one like this. If even only half the stories are true-- - All true, sir. - Yes, quite. Well, er, perhaps I should speak to the staff before the Americans arrive and explain about the new ownership? - There's no staff, sir. Just me and Aggie Pinkley. Mr. Huston left a fortnight ago. Nobody stays. Only me, I stay. (tense music) (pail crashes) (door slams) (Aggie shouts) - What on earth? (Aggie screaming) (door slams) - Aggie Pinkley just resigned. (playful music) - It's humongous! - Look at this. This is a dream! - What an electric bill! - It's beautiful! - It's ours. (playful music) - Yes? - Oh, good morning. We're the Otises. - [Umney] Are you now? - Yes. (chuckles) Who are you? - I'm Mrs. Umney, the housekeeper. Well, I suppose you want to come in. - I think after 7,000 miles that's the general idea, yes. - Not a very good one. You'd be better off in the hotel in the village. - Well, we're not staying in a hotel. We own this place. - Follow me. - Whoa! - Look! - Oh, wow! - Mr. and Mrs. Otis, welcome to Canterville Chase. - Thank you. - I'm Smythe of Smythe and Jennings. - Oh, how do you do? I'm John. - Ah. - This is my wife, Lucy. And these are the kids. That one's Rob. Uh, that's-- - Hi, Mr. Smythe. - Willie there and this is our youngest, Virginia. - Hi, Mr. Smythe. Sir. - (laughs) Charming, charming. Now may I kiss the hand of the new Lady de Canterville? - Oh! - You're a Lady now, Mom? - Well, yes, I guess so, sweetheart. - Your Lady Mother is the last known blood kin of the de Canterville line. We had quite a time finding her. Now, you must be dreadfully tired. Please, come, make yourselves comfortable. - Ah. Oh, this is so beautiful! - Yeah, look at this book. - [John] What is that, son? - Until three weeks ago, I didn't even know I had any English relations. It's been quite an adjustment for all of us. - Why don't we sit down and discuss the transfer of ownership while the children explore? - Can we, Dad? - [John] All right. - All right, let's go, Rob! - [John] Slowly, slowly. - What a beautiful book! - [Smythe] It's a history of the de Cantervilles. - They must have been wonderful! (object slams) Is it all right if I go out into the gardens? - Certainly, child. Take the book with you. It has, er, a plan of the grounds inside. (door creaks) - Hey, Rob! - What do you want? - Take a look at this! - Wow, what a creep. (playful music) - Sir Simon de Canterville, 1548 to... They don't have another number. What do you think, he never died? - Well, sure he did. (gentle music) - Oh, Mister Gardener! Mr. Gardener? Mr. Gardener, you don't have to run away. Just wanted to ask you about the flowers. (birds singing) Mr. Gardener! Mr. Gardener? (birds singing) - So, we'll have the completed papers ready for your signature in a few days and... Oh. - Here, Mom. They're for you. - Oh, Virginia, how thoughtful. They're beautiful. Where did you pick them? - I didn't, the gardener did. He just left them there. - The gardener? (Mrs. Umney clears throat) - You got to see this, Dad, this place is really weird. - Everything is weird to my sons. - Dad, there's blood on the floor. - In the library, there's blood on the floor, honest. See? It's blood, isn't it? - Of course it's blood. That's where the murder occurred. (all gasp) - [Willie] Murder? - The Lady Eleanor. She was killed in 1590 by himself, Sir Simon. - Er, Mrs. Umney, Mrs. Umney. I'm sure the Otises will find these stories far more interesting after they've had a chance to rest. - Oh, then I shouldn't even tell them about his ghost! - [Kids] Ghost? - Mrs. Umney, all old English manors have ghost stories attached to them. I'm sure you don't believe in them. - Well! - Well, whatever that mess is on the floor, I'm sure we can clean it up later. - [Umney] Well, we'll see about that, that spot of blood-- - Mrs. Umney. Mrs. Umney, thank you. - Well, I know, but they'll have to know about the spot of blood. When it comes back-- - I know. - Look, they're going to be very surprised if they-- - Fine, I'll tell them! (door thuds shut) (Smythe sighs) Now, how about a little drink to celebrate? - Righto. (Smythe laughs) You sure you want to stay? - Of course I do. - [John] Good. I think I'll tidy up. - Sure is one weird looking dude. - He looks so sad. (gentle music) (wind howling) (page rustles) - Well, you can read more in the morning, okay, sweetheart? - Okay. It's so interesting, though. Did you know that Sir Simon once acted in Shakespeare's company? - [Lucy] Really? - Yeah, but he had to use another name, of course, because noblemen didn't do those sorts of things in those days. - That sounds fascinating, honey, and you can tell us all about it in the morning. But right night it's time for your old mom and dad to get some rest. (Lucy laughs) - Okay. - Goodnight, honey. - You want me to leave the light on? - No I'm fine. - Okay. (light clicks off) Goodnight. Aw. (laughs) Goodnight, Virginia. - Hey, Dad, what's with these lights? - Oh, it's the wind. Or wiring, probably. We'll sort it out tomorrow. - Maybe it's the ghost. - Oh, we've had enough talk about all of that. Everything's going to be just fine. Now, can I have a hug? - Goodnight. - Goodnight, both of you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mom. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Dad. - [John] You boys sleep tight. We've got a lot of unpacking to do tomorrow. (wind howling) (thunder crashing) (wind howling) (door creaks and slams) - Go on, you bloody banshee. (ghostly laughing echoing) Shut up your howl. You'll not shiver my bones, Sir Simon de Canterville. (wind howling outside) (ghostly laugh echoing) (rain falling) (creaking objects nearby) - What was that? - It's just the wind. (wind howling outside) (creaking objects nearby) (door bangs nearby) - What's that? - John. - Hmm? - John, listen. (ghostly voice moaning) - Ha! You're in good voice tonight, you stagnant bag of bones! (laughs) Do your work well, they'll not last the week. (laughs) (thunder crashes) (dramatic music) (thunder crashes) (dramatic music) (birds singing) - Mrs. Umney, did you hear anything last night? - Sir Simon. He often cackles in the dark. - Mrs. Umney, please don't scare the children. - [Rob] Well, who's scared? - Hey, Dad, Rob and me found an old tree. Looks like it's turned to stone. - That's a part of it. - [Virginia] Part of what, Mrs. Umney? - The murderous curse. That almond tree is the key. - Well, why would he want to kill his wife for no reason? - He's a beast, child. And he's just starting in on you Otises. Whenever he finds somebody he doesn't like, he really gets going. - Why shouldn't he like us? - He's never liked any of the de Cantervilles. He's haunted them to their deaths. Now, you're a nice family. Leave while you can. - Mrs. Umney, we have no intention of leaving. We are here to stay. (Mrs. Umney clears throat) No amount of scrubbing can ever make it go away. Lord knows I've tried. - Well, Lord knows you didn't try quite hard enough, Mrs. Umney. Look. There. That's not too ghostly is it? - Not for now. - All right! - Okay! - All right, come on, go on, hit it! (children chattering) - Okay, now swing at it. - Can I play? - Sorry, sis, have to wait your turn. All right, now, here let me show you. Here, here, swing like this. Just go woo, yeah. You've got it. - Your nieces are adorable, Mr. Smythe. - (laughs) They seem to have taken to your sons as well. The girls were terribly eager to meet with them. Mrs. Otis, despite your inheritance, I find it strange that you would choose to live at the Chase. - Well, it's not every family who gets a chance to live an adventure like this. - (laughs) We English have learned to live with the musty old spirits that roam our ancient halls. - [Virginia] Well, Sir Simon wasn't a musty old spirit. - [Smythe] Oh? - He was a scholar and a painter and an actor. And he was knighted in the king's service. (Lucy laughs) - [Lucy] Virginia was reading about him last night. - Well, if you read a little more, you'll find that the ghost of Canterville Chase is a scoundrel and a rogue! (laughs) - Then you do believe in his existence? Well, I shouldn't worry, Mr. Smythe. Sir Simon has not come up against the Canterville Otises before. Has he? - Nope. (Lucy laughs) (wind howling) - (laughing) Did you see the look on his face when I told him there was no spook who was a match for the Otises of Ohio? (both laugh) Oh, I really want us to stay here. Do you think it's going to be too much for us? - No, we'll work something out. Lady de Canterville, you are terrific. (gentle music) (ghostly laugh echoing) (eerie music) (Sir Simon laughing) (wind blowing) - You hear that? - Of course I heard that. Just go to sleep. (wind howling) (door slams) - He's here! (footsteps echoing) - John? - I hear it. It's got to be Rob and Willie. It's like they're tearing the house down. (Sir Simon laughing) (eerie music) (Sir Simon moaning) (eerie music) (Sir Simon moaning) - What's going on, Dad? - Nothing, boys, just stay with your mother. Everything's going to be okay. - [Lucy] John, be careful. - All right. Hey, you! You there? Wherever you are. Uh, listen. Can we talk? (suspenseful music) All right, now, look, Sir Simon, or whatever your name is. (John chuckles) Uh. (clears throat) I've heard your story. Now you hear mine. Uh... Look, if you have to haunt this place, could you do it someplace away from my family? Please? (wind howling outside) (playful music) Look, uh... We're really beginning to love this place. And uh, my wife and I have decided that we're not moving out. So, I think it'd be better if you'd just cooperate and hold it down. I guess that's all. (door slams) - [Rob] Did you really talk to the ghost, Dad? - All's quiet. Come on, everybody, let's get back to bed. - In you go, Virginia. - Did you see the ghost, Mommy? - Well, I saw something, sweetheart, but, oh, I think it was harmless. - I wish I could have seen the ghost. - Oh. Ah, goodnight, honey. - Goodnight. You were very brave! (laughs) - I was scared out of my wits. (both laugh) - Do you think it worked? - I don't know, we'll have to wait and see. - Oh John, he looked so terrible. Do you think it's safe for us to stay here? - Oh, come on, how can a little wind and flickering lights hurt us? If we stand our ground, he's just going to have to learn to live with us. Come on, the show's over. (gentle music) For tonight. (birds singing) - [Willie] Where'd you get the keys? - Mrs. Umney left them on a hook inside the pantry. - Wow! No one's been in here in years. - Now, the book said that Lady Eleanor's brothers locked him up here in one of these rooms. He's got to be here somewhere. Oh! (coughs) - Well, what do we do when we find him? - Well, you heard Dad at breakfast. We stand up to him. Only, we take care of him. - Right. (eerie music) - Now, he's got to be up here somewhere. If we have to search this whole house, we're gonna find him. - I don't know. Maybe we should leave it to Dad. Rob. Rob! - What is it? - That, that thing. It wasn't there when we came in. - Well, sure it was. Ghosts don't haunt in the daytime. It's only a clock. (Sir Simon cackling) - You're the Otises, eh? The brave intrepid clan from the Colonies, eh? Well, let's test your gibbets on my pike! - Go, go, go! (Sir Simon laughing) - Well, if it's war he wants, it's war he's gonna get. - I thought we just lost the war there. - Rob, Willie, your friends are here. (pop music) (gentle music) Sir Simon? Sir Simon? (wind howling) (door slams) - Shouldn't you two be getting ready for bed? - Oh, yeah. - Uh, yeah. - We were just going. - Well, you should. I feel an ominous presence tonight. (footsteps banging) - Beware this night, you dwellers in mortal flesh. Quiet ye bones that support it. On this night, I, Sir Simon de Canterville, come to shiver your souls, to show you the maw of eternity and the damnation that comes to claim it. (quietly) Maw of eternity... Damnation that comes to claim it. (helmet clanks) - Come on, we got to get this finished. (wind howling) (Sir Simon crashes) - We got him! - All right! - I told you we could nail him! - What the devil do you boys think you're doing? - We got him, Dad! - He won't bother the Otises again, you can count on it. - [John] Get down there and clean that up. - But it was him, the ghost. We set a trap for him. - All I see is a mess. Go. - But Dad-- - You heard your dad, go. (John sighs) (gentle music) (Sir Simon groans) - Sir Simon. You're hurt. - Vexed. Distressed, but... But not hurt, child. The Earl of Canterville Chase is immune to such mortal sensations. - You talk! - Talk? Talk, indeed! I howl and terrorize! Why, I could boil your blood with a look! - Then it was you in the library. Why didn't you answer when I called? - Child, I don't speak with every blasted mortal on demand! Beware! In this very room, I drove the wicked Earl of Sussex to throw himself from that window! - You've forgotten, I've seen you out of costume. - Oh, ah. So you have, so you have. - If you are a ghost, how can you bump into things? - Oh, I do it sometimes for effect. Can't keep it up for long, I begin to fade. Oh, confound those pestering brothers of yours! In 500 years of dignified haunting, I am never been subject to such impudence! - Dignified haunting? You've hardly been a gentleman. You've frightened my mother, my father hasn't had a night of rest, and now my brothers are all in trouble because of you. - Oh, what's the use? I'm losing my touch. I can't even pull off a good scare anymore. The people of your century are so cruel and unfeeling. I thought you were different. - Oh, but I am. So different that nobody even wants me for a friend. - But why do you want to be like the rest? When I was alive, I was different and proud of it. - Mrs. Umney said you murdered your wife. - Ah, Mrs. Umney! Mrs. Umney! Garrulous old witch! Mrs. Umney will get hers if I can think up a fate vile enough. - Did you? Kill your wife, I mean. - The fair Eleanor? My royal lady? (chuckles) What a greedy and curious creature she was. No, I was merely the first to get about the work. - That's terrible. Your own wife. - Hmm. You never tasted her cooking. - You don't kill someone 'cause they can't cook! - Child, you know nothing of the evil of wives and wicked brothers. When Eleanor's brothers, Harold and Wormsley, locked me up in their impromptu architecture, they thought they'd have the Canterville Emerald all to themselves. Ah. (laughs) But I fooled them. Just as I fooled her. Oh, yes. It was for this and for this alone that my royal lady married me. (chuckles) They stood outside my prison for eight days, hoping I'd give them some clue, the wretches! - You should have given it to them. - Ah! I wouldn't give them the scales off a kipper! - [John] Okay, boys, back to bed. And no more funny stuff, I mean it. - Are you all right? I thought I heard voices. - No, Mom, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight, Sir Simon. (gentle music) (dramatic music) - You know, Rob, I don't know why Dad didn't believe us. When he saw the ghost I believed him. - You know, when you get older, Willie, you'll understand that parents really believe you. But sometimes they don't want to let you know it. - Rob, Willie! - Yeah, Mom? - Last night was one thing, but your father warned you, no more practical jokes. - Mom-- - Enough, enough. You get some soap and water and a bucket and you clean up this mess or your father's going to hear about it. - You know, the next time you do something like this, Willie, you should really tell me about it first. - Me? Gee, you're beginning to sound like Dad. (gentle music) - According to that great big, thick book, today's your birthday. I guess that people that do awful things like you, they still have to have a birthday. But I know that after 500 years, you can't have many friends. But anyway, happy birthday. I won't wish you anymore because I know how tired you are. (gentle music) (door thuds shut) - Ah! - Hi, Mrs. Umney. - Well, you're looking sad, child. Is something wrong? - Oh, my brothers said the bloodstain came back again. - Oh. It'll always come back. - Is there any way he can ever rest? - None at all. Unless... - Unless what? - No. - Unless what, Mrs. Umney? - The prophecy. - The prophecy? What's that? - Come on, I'll show you. (door thuds shut) It's been there for centuries. - "When a golden girl can win prayer "from out the lips of sin, "When the barren almond bears, "and the little child gives away its tears, "Then shall all the house be still "and peace come back to Canterville." What does that mean? - The Lord only knows. It's been a riddle for ages, otherwise we'd have gotten rid of old Sir Simon de Canterville and his shenanigans. Ha! - I wouldn't, my child. That chime has not played its tune since the night of Lady Eleanor's death. - Well, I bet you could make it play. - I came to thank you for the flowers. This gives you no warrant, you understand. But you are such a confounding creature. - [Virginia] Then you were there! - As I am here now. But you breathe one word of what I'm about to tell you and I'll haunt you all the way back to your precious Ohio. (sighs) My Lady, her death was not quite as it's been told. - Then it wasn't her cooking, was it? - No. But deserved, nonetheless. She was a beauty, my royal lady. But in beauty there may be a flaw. I loved her as no man ever quested after his love. - You loved her? - Very much. More than she returned, sad to say. No. It was this she prized, not me. I knew once she wore this she'd have no need of me. So I hid it! Up there, behind that shield. (chuckles) With her brothers, she searched every room in the house, every nook and cranny. Then, that fateful night, she climbed this chair, this very one. - [Virginia] Then you didn't murder the Lady Eleanor! - Oh, heavens, no. I bought this chain for her beautiful neck. But the falling sword, the one on the right, fell on her and killed her. Had I not the presence of mind to recover the stone, Harold and Wormsley would have grabbed it up and been off to London in a waddle of twiddle. - I knew you didn't do it! I knew you were innocent! - Nay, nay, child, nay. Innocence is a word, a luxury of the young. No, no, I tempted her. I tempted my royal lady and now I'm doomed to roam these halls! For 500 years, I have not breathed a word of this secret to a soul! And if you tell it, for the next 500 I'll be known as a lout and a fraud. - Oh, but I wouldn't. Friends don't tell secrets. - Oh. (music box chiming) - Thank you! That's very pretty. - Oh, no. No, no, no, no. For such a delicate creature, you astound me. It's a galliard, not a fling. You dance it with elegance, not as though you were stamping out a fire. Here, let me show you. (gentle music) - Oh, you're hand's cold. - Sorry. (gentle music) - You dance very well. (gentle music) - [Lucy] Virginia? - In here, Mother. - Till later, my lady. - Virginia, what are you doing in here alone? - Oh, Mother, you should have seen it! Sir Simon was here and we danced! It was wonderful! It was like none of the stories I've ever read! - Sir Simon was in here? Dancing with you? - Yeah, we're friends now. I got to go tell Mrs. Umney. Mrs. Umney! Mrs. Umney! (door slams) (wind howling) (pop music on boombox) (thunder crashing) - (shudders) Blast this curse of mine! The child has friends here! I'll not spoil her joy for a mere clatter and a bang. I won't do it! (thunder crashes) Ah! Oh! Oh, very well. So be it, so be it. (pop music on boombox) (thunder crashing) (boombox stops) - [Kid] Oh, hey! - [Girl] What a bummer! - It's just a storm, kids. Sit tight, I can fix it. - I'll go with you. (thunder crashing) (kids chattering) (Sir Simon moaning) (thunder crashes) - Stop, Sir Simon, they're my friends. - I can't help it. It's my curse. (moaning) (boombox plays pop music) - Hey, look. He's just a raggedy old man. - [Virginia] Stop. - He's not scary, he's pretty funny looking. (children laughing) - Stop! Stop! You don't understand! He's my friend. (lightning crashes) (children screaming) Sir Simon, stop! (children screaming) Stop, Sir Simon! Sir Simon, Stop! (children screaming) (thunder crashing) (dramatic music) - Virginia! - [Lucy] Virginia! (dramatic music) - I have to go to him. - Virginia, Virginia, you just rest. - I could sit up with her through the night if you'd like. Well, it'd be no trouble. - Thank you, Mrs. Umney. - I'll be right back. - Doctor said just to let her rest. - Sleep well, my little one. Resist that long darkness I have so craved. You have no guilt but the guilt which I have given you. (thunder crashing) This night, I come to, to pray for a young girl. Oh, Lord forgive my unworthiness. A sinner, a murderer I am called. Fraud that I am. I would suffer a thousand years of torment that she be spared pain and doubt. It was I who betrayed our friendship. Because I couldn't resist this damnable curse that shackles me. Forgive me and spare her. (dramatic music) - Sir Simon. (dramatic music) (Mrs. Umney coughs) (dramatic music) Sir Simon? - [Sir Simon] The vault. - (quietly) Open up. (dramatic music) Sir Simon? (eerie music) Sir Simon? - Ah! What are you doing in this devil's place, child? You should be in your room, resting. - I had a dream. You were in trouble. - Well, trouble, perhaps. I was praying for you, you mischievous wart! - You prayed? - Oh, dry your eyes. You're better? - [Virginia] Oh, much better. - Ah. - Sir Simon, don't you see? - [Sir Simon] See? See what? - The storm. It stopped. But it stopped because you prayed. - Ah! I haven't prayed in 500 years. I hardly think my prayers would stop a shower now. - You don't understand, do you? Sir Simon, the prophecy. The curse is broken. You're free. You prayed from the lips of sin and I cried. I'm a child, right? - Yeah, not the child it requires. Don't bother yourself. That stone-pitted almond tree wouldn't bear fruit if the Lord himself returned and did somersaults. Now, go on back to your room and rest. Huh? (gentle music) - [Virginia] Blossoms mean fruit, don't they? - Yes. Yes. It's done. I'm free. Now we must say farewell, Virginia Otis. - I don't want you to die. - Oh, child, I died so many years ago. Oh, what you've given me is rest. Peace, at last. And I've given you so little but tears. Here. - I couldn't. - Virginia. I tried so hard to earn the love of a royal lady. Now I finally found one who deserves my gift. Take it. Now, go along. - I'll miss you, Sir Simon. - And I you, my royal lady. (dramatic music) - You're warm. - Yes. Now go. (dramatic music) - [Virginia] Goodbye, Sir Simon. (dramatic music) - Virginia! - She's not in here. - Nor there either. - Where could she be? - Don't worry, hon, we'll... - Mother? - Virginia! Honey, where have you been? - With Sir Simon. He's gone now. But he was here. And he wasn't mean or cruel. But he needed a child to help. - Oh, sweetheart, it's all right. - Whatever happened, pumpkin, you're safe with us. - You don't believe me, do you? I'll show you. - Where did that come from? - That's the Canterville Emerald. The curse is broken. - Yes, it is, Mrs. Umney. Come, everyone. Come look. (dramatic music) See? It's the almond tree. (bright orchestral music)
