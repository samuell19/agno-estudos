The Dream Sincerely Your Cousin Hans "I dreamt terrible things... It was horrible...!" "Your wife says that her cousin has arrived." "You must excuse me... I cannot eat with you." "I can't touch the knife!" "You left this key lying in the caf?!" "Is there some reason you're reluctant to enter your house?" "Sorry, it's part of my job." "My friend left his house last night, greatly agitated... ...and has not yet returned. We're very concerned..." "We fear an accident... since the murder in the neighboring house... ...my husband has been completely distraught..." "We've received no reports of any accidents... ...Incidentally, the murderer was arrested today in Munich!" "...and worst of all... ...last night I felt a sudden compulsion to kill my wife... ...whom I love more than anything...!" "Do you know of no one who can help you?" "You mean Dr. Orth. He lives just across the way." "I didn't expect that we would meet again so soon." "I'm coming to you because I'm totally distraught!... ...Tormented by inexplicable fears...! ...It is impossible for me to touch a knife...!" "We do know of such illneses... and also of the possibility of their cure." "But that's not all...!" "I am happily married and yet... yesterday evening... ...I was overcome with an almost irresistible urge... ...to kill my wife... isn't that crazy...?" "No... but it may be a sign of serious psychological illness!" "There's no reason to despair." "Perhaps I can help you. There is a method... ...called psychoanalysis... ...that I like to apply with such illnesses." "I've reserved a room at a hotel. Believe me, it's better that way." "I'm taking charge of your husband's treatment." "It is better during the treatment period, which will... ...last several months, that your husband does not live at home." "That is everything, doctor!" No... that is by no means everything. You can be cured... ...only when we have worked together to uncover... ...the 'unconscious' psychological conflicts which led to your illness!" "You will start by telling me everything you see in your mind's eye!" "Don't hold back anything because you think it is unimportant or nonsensical!" "Thoughts will come up that you may not wish to express... ...Tell them to me anyway." "A few day ago... in the morning... ...in my wife's bedroom... I suddenly heard..." "HELP!!!" "Last night... with a razor...!" "The impressions of that morning shook you greatly... ...psychologically... ...Had you recently quarreled with your wife?" "No!" "I grew up with my wife... Marriage to her has given... ...my life its meaning." "We were deeply in love, and wanted children... but..." "Did something... happen... to cause you to give up hope of progeny?" "I don't know... but lately... ...I have been plagued by terrible fantasies... ...I have seen my wife in shameful situations...!" "What are the characteristics of this man who has appeared to you in these fantasies?" "Wait a minute...!" "I think I recognize him now... it's my childhood friend... ...my wife's cousin." "Did your wife give you a reason to be jealous of her cousin?" "He is my best friend. Shortly after our wedding... ...he left us... to go to the tropics... ...I was never consciously jealous of him... "As he took his leave from us... I felt a strange emotion stirring in me..." "Then, years went by. On the day... ...before the outbreak of my illness... ...we received a letter from him that he was returning..." Months passed of arduous work by doctor and patient... ...Finally today... an important new memory... ...rose to consciousness in the parient. "On the night before the outbreak of my illness there was a bad storm." "I had terrible dreams that night!" "Since we have learned to interpret it... ...the dream has become the most important door... ...to our knowledge of the unconscious!" "The images are muddled..." "I don't want to look at them!" "You may not give in to this resistance!" "Arriving today at 10:30 a.m. ... Cousin Hans." "When I got the telephone message that our cousin had arrives..." "That is a typical mistake to make when receiving news... ...that is 'unconsciously' unwelcome." "In the dream I stood before an Indian idol..." Sincerely Your Cousin Hans "Why is this exotic image in your dream?" "In the dream, a small Italian city... ...one I saw frequently on our honeymoon... ...emerged before my eyes... ...A bell tower grew steeply up out of the ground..." "The laughing of these three women's heads was terrible!" "Did you recognize the women?" "These humiliations hit you in your most vulnerable spot!" "Then, in the dream, I stood before a prison cell... ...and looked through the bars." "What did you see?" "In your nightmare, the small wound on your wife's neck... ...flowed together with the crime in the nearby house... ...for this reason you saw yourself condemned as a murderer." "These dream fantasies led, in your consciousness... ...to a morbid aversion to touching a knife." "So this psychological illness kept you from killing your wife!" "Were you finished with your dream of the trial?" "No... I saw water... turbulent, dark water!" "It has long been known that dreams of water... ...signify 'imminent' or 'wished for' birth...!" "She gives the doll to her cousin!" "Did you ever experience anything similar... ...in your childhood?" "Back then she gave 'our' doll to her cousin!" "The pain that you experienced when your wife gave 'our doll'... ...to her cousin has remained awake in your childless marriage!!" "In the dream I got into a furious rage..." "Have you notices what you're holding in your hand?" "I am able to touch a knife again..." "I've got a lot to apologize for!" Epilogue THE END
