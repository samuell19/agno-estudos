Is there anything I can help you with? Kick the barrel away, perhaps? Don't jump! It can go wrong. Ropes are so bad nowadays. It's Depression quality. Tell me, brother... Why are you tired of life? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why! Because I don't have any money. Excuse me, ma'am, Could you help me with some money towards food and a bed. Bertil Waller puts on a good party. Imagine, the only child and so charming. Eh? I think that depends what you mean. I love you, Maria. And I love you, Bertil. - I'm so happy. - So am I. Our rich uncle seems to be in good humour tonight. We managed to clean up a quarter of a million on it. Have a cushion, Uncle. You'll feel more comfortable. No, I'm fine, thank you. Would you like something to drink, Uncle? No, and nothing to drink, either. I can look after myself! Your dad looks worried tonight. Not at all, Bertil... Daddy's beaming like the sun itself. I can feel a draught. I'll go shut the door. Excuse me, can you spare some change? What? Can you help me with a little money? Heard that before. What was that about? Probably just a beggar. Come back inside. What did I tell you? You can't trust rope... It's made of paper. It could have gone badly for you. You might have killed yourself. What is there to live for... ...when everything circulates around... money? I've never had any money... ...and have no chance of ever having any. Why waste your time on that in this wonderful world. Why brood about why you don't have money today, or how you shall get some tomorrow? The present moment is all you know that you actually have. Obviously you should enjoy it then. Enjoy it? How do you do that when you've nothing to eat and don't have work? Work!? Piffle! Does a cat work? No, and no again! Why must it be that we human beings are the ones that have to work? Look at these millionaire sons... They sleep their way to success. I'm not a millionaire's son. I'm just hungry. Don't you worry... Your hunger will soon be satisfied. Come with me. "Evening News". Really? We’ll send you the usual fiver. Where to? My boy... One gets dead, and one gets bread. While we're waiting for the fiver, we'll go down to the sea... and count the waves Robbery and murder. Embezzlement. Corruption scandal. Young man hangs himself for lack of money. Money money money! Money... I have an idea... yes! Money... the theme for a film! I can already see how the money will roll in. MONEY A tragi-comic tale You all know why you've been summoned here. I'm going to read the last will and testament of the late Kurt Bergdahl. I hereby declare my final will and testament. My dear relatives... I'm sure you're all glad that I've popped off at last. I've seen the disappointed looks on your faces when you've seen me looking remarkably well, instead of one foot in the grave. You, Beatrice, are sure to be biting your nails in anxiety, thinking about your share of the money. I've fooled you all many times before, and I'm not changing now. My personal fortune, amounting to 1.5 million kronor, I give in full to my charwoman's son, Harry Orvar Larsson... who was always nice to me when he was a child. I ask my lawyer to use press and radio to find him. Should Harry Orvar Larsson, or his heirs or beneficiaries not be found within months of the reading of this will at noon today, my entire estate goes to my wife's brother, Anton Bodin. What is it, Daddy? I'd really hoped that... What? No, it's nothing, child. Harry Orvar Larsson... Here you are, my friend... Something cool to drink... No, my friend... ...you have drunk the cup of tragedy dry. Out of the cup will sprout a little flower, called comedy.. It'll be the mother of comedy! I'll give you a little something... that people leave behind them too quickly... The spirit of a child. I can't thank you too much for restoring my faith in life. I only hope I get a chance to do something good for you. Don't worry yourself about that. You end up comparing what you gave with what you got, and it always leads to a breakdown of even the most solid friendships. It's not much of a life, if you can't show obligation-free affection to a friend. What's news? Look at this... Leading financier shoots himself. Unfortunate investments. There, you see what happens! You should have a stock exchange full of nothing but cobwebs. Think about the financier’s family... ...one day, rolling in money, and next day, nothing. Look at that sky! Oh for a blue sky! Look at that cloud! The one that looks like a cow? Forgeries detected... You're quite alone, when something like this happens. Alone? How can you feel you're alone? I've no intention of leaving you. I want to marry you. Admittedly, you haven't much income... Oh Bertil, don't talk like that! Discussions about income and money... I'm fed up with them. It's just been a nightmare. Police investigation... Creditors... Malicious people... All with one thought... Money, money, money! I've decided to put my former life behind me. Start a new life. Maybe I'll come back to you... when I've had time to forget all this. No Maria... My mind is quite made up! Please go now. I'll wait for you... ...no matter how long it takes. Yes, Birger? I don't feel like just walking. I want to do something useful... work. I've heard there's work to be found in the forest. I don't think a man has a right to waste his time like this. Time passes... time... There's a time for everything. Birth has its time. Death has its time. Planting a crop has its time. Harvesting the crop has its time. Crying has its time. Being happy has its time. There's a time for kicking a stone away, too. Collecting stones has its time. I just don't have time any longer. To embrace has its time. To disengage also has its time. War has its time. And peace has its time. What benefit for his effort, does the one who works, get? It's like grasping for the wind. I must have something to occupy myself. I want to start a regular life. Goodbye. Goodbye my friend. Look after yourself. I'm not one who'd rip apart your attire, to keep you from going. Thank you for these wonderful days we've had together. Farewell. You take the low road... and I'll take the high road. Maybe we'll see each other. If not, we'll never meet again. Farewell, my friend. Thanks for the grub! It tasted like chicken. Thanks, sweetheart! Don't get fresh! You know what we have to do? Yes, but... Enjoy your meal? Fantastic! How about that porridge! I think it was burnt... and sticky... But it tasted bloody great! No, no, no... We'll clear the table. But that's my job! Get to it, boys! What will I do, then? Sing us a little song! Alright, then, I will! What would you like me to sing? A love song. Why not? Love between two people is the most beautiful thing there is. The maiden dreamt of her handsome knight To a faraway land he had traveled Where he wanted to find a crown of gold But the shadows fall so long By day she stood watching out from her tower Spin, my bridesmaids, spin! Was that I heard, his horn a-blowing? Never have I felt so sad And roses of the reddest silk there is She sews on the mantel so many Where was his sword now lifted, his lance now lowered? But the shadows fall so long Oh, shall I never be my lover's bride? Spin, my bridesmaids, spin! And then on the door a rapping was heard And proudly, the knight strode in. The knight...? Did you get lost in the forest? No, I'm looking for work. As what? That was silly of me, sorry. As a lumberjack. He wants a job as a lumberjack! So you're strong, are you? Yes, I'm quite strong. We'll shake on that! You're as strong as a bear! As a teddy bear! You should be ashamed of yourselves! He's just a poor lost soul. Let him stay and help you in the forest. Don't you have something he could do? Sure there is. Right, boys? Yeah, sure! Help him with his hat. I'll fix him something to eat. Idiot! You ruined my fine nose. You'll live to regret that! How nice you've become friends. Harry Orvar Larsson. Bluebeard the Knight. Harry Orvar Larsson. Harry Orvar Larsson. Snow White Harry Orvar Larsson. Napoleon. Harry Orv... Harry Orvar Larsson. Harry Orvar Larsson. Count Piper. Come and eat now. Taste alright? Tastes wonderful. What's your name? Just call me Harry. Eat up now, Harry. You'll have your work cut out for you in the morning. So, let's get to work. Where's Harry? Harry! Where's that little scoundrel got to? Come out! Go around! Find out! What shall I find out? Cut down the pines over there. Hurry up! Go and help Charley saw. Chow time! Where's Harry? Here he comes. You look exhausted. That was crazy! Sit down and rest and I'll get you a sandwich. Sit down! Sit still! Is there something wrong with the sandwich? It's so peaceful here in the forest... ...like being in another world. Do you think I'm a bit sentimental? Yeah... No, not at all! Yes? What's on your mind, Sigurd? I'd like to... I'd really like to... ...leave you these flowers. May I leave some flowers? Thank you so much! Such lovely flowers! What would that be there? It's the lucky horseshoe ...that will bring happiness and good luck to all of us. Lucky horseshoe! Would someone like to fetch some firewood? I'll do that! Harry! Turn on the radio. The sought-after heir to millions, Harry Orvar Larsson- has still not been seen or heard from... ...despite repeated appeals. Harry Orvar Larsson is about 25 years old, 170cm tall, clean shaven, good teeth, blue eyes, dark wavy hair. Larsson should contact the lawyer Mr Enwall, telephone 63 34 68 before 12 noon on June 1, this year. After that, the inheritance will go to others. The amount is 1.5 million kronor The program will continue with our regular recorded music. We begin with 'Harlequin's Milieu'. Here's the firewood. Now we'll see... 170...that's right. Dark wavy hair, that's right. Blue eyes... that's right. Good teeth. How old are you? 24. What did you say your name was? Harry Orvar Larsson. That's right! That doesn't matter. I'll pick it up... Harry Orvar needn't bother. We'll do that, dear boy! He should sit down. Little dumpling! Give him a seat... Get some sandwiches and coffee from the kitchen! Are you comfy? I'll set the table again. Give him lots of butter! Two lumps of sugar? One... and two... Cream... Would you have a newspaper? Newspaper! Here's your newspaper! How would you like a cigar? Yes thanks. Can I cut it for you? No, I'll do it myself. It's uneven. Here are some flowers. Doesn't he look stupid! A light! A fingerbowl! I'll fetch one from the kitchen. What are you looking for? A fingerbowl. - A fingerbowl?! - Yes, that's right. Who needs a fingerbowl? Harry. Buying price... 205... Selling... 210. Reimersholm... Buying 21. Selling 22. Have they really dropped that much? Yes, they've gone down. That was a terrible cigar. You clear the table and do the dishes... while I take a walk in the forest. Would you like to join me for a walk in the forest? Love to! My hat... What's this all about? I haven't the faintest idea... Not a clue. They must have realised they can't play games with me. I can be tough. You must have charmed them... They're treating you as though you were a millionaire. It'll be a massage next! Boy, did I have trouble controlling my temper! How about a smile? That's better. Hey, boys... I have an idea. You know... I've a feeling I've met you before. Maybe we met in another world. Exactly... in a better world. An ideal one. That's a fault of mine. What is? Walking around, dreaming, and weaving patterns in my mind. Then I weave an image of you... ...as an angel, a gleaming, lovely angel... ...floating around, to music. And all around it is love and harmony. You must have come from a better world... ...as you have such beautiful soft hands. Harry... No, we shan't talk about that. - What's not to talk about? - Nothing. Just a memory. I've come to realise... The friends you have when you have money... ...disappear when you no longer have it. I'm your friend, despite having no money. Yes, I have 62 cents... Thanks, Harry. Oh, how lovely it is in the forest! It's so fresh, so healthy and nice. What a joy it is to work till you're tired... ...and feel refreshed at the same time. The way to live... The right way to live. You should live for the moment and get everything you can out of this wonderful life. Maria... Who knows what the future holds? And after he has written a will in favor of us... then! One and a half million divided by six. How much is that? One, two, three, four, five. -No, it's six! - Five! - Six! - Five! - Six! - Count it yourself! One, two, three, four, five. Yes, there are only five of us. Money... money! We stand up, when a lady comes into the room. Thank you for a wonderful walk in the forest. Thanks yourself. Tonight I've made a discovery. So have we. Goodnight, everyone! Have you have made a bed for me? Where do you want to sleep? Back, back, back... Good. Keep your distance... - Is this good for you? - Oh, it'll do for now. A lullaby! A lullaby! Sleep you little willow tree, for it is still winter Birch and heather, you sleep too, roses and the hyacinth Spring is still so far away, when the mountain ashes flower Sleep you little willow tree, for it is still winter He's sleeping... The candle. Good morning! We've brought you breakfast in bed. Hope you had a good sleep. Excellent. And you? Didn't sleep a wink. It was a terrible night. Really? Why was that? I had such a dreadful dream. I dreamt I had to cut down a large tree. I chopped and chopped, but it was stubborn. Then... I steeled myself for an almighty swing of the axe... ...which came down... ...then spun away... ...and beheaded... ...YOU, Harry! Ours is a hazardous job. You really have to have a will. Yes, I'll certainly write mine. The one that inherits my 501 kronor 62 ore shall be my best friend. So who would that be? That's you, Harry. I can do better than any perhaps. No! I'll leave my tools and my 837.50 to you, Harry. You shouldn't be so nice to me. I'm just not used to so much love. Forgive us if we've been nasty to you. We're so regretful for our behaviour... You have something we lack but would love to have, namely... Which is what? He didn't mean anything by it. Now we have to get our little laddie dressed. When I'm dead, I'll leave you my kit and my silver snuff box. And I'll bequeath you my sculpture that I've been carving for 15 years. My dear, dear friends... I really don't know what to say. I'd love to write my will to your benefit... but I barely own what I stand up in. You have my friendship till the day I die. We can't wait for that. Harry, the first day I saw you, wearing this coat... Such a lovely jacket... always wanted one like it. It's yours, Sigge! No, not until you're dead. I'd like to have your trousers. And I’d like to have your shoes. Nothing left for you, Charley! Birger and I can each have a shoe. You can all share everything of mine. Here you have our wills, all six of them. No, I can't do it. Well, if you're going to insist... No, sit down... Now we have to write it out. It's unnecessary... You're getting it all, anyhow. - It's just to be safe. - Yes, of course. I can't write with this pen. Not with this either... We don't have a competent witness. Just a moment. Come in. Well, look who's turned up! Great to see you. What a nice surprise! Yes, but didn't you invite us...? Now that you're here you can witness a document that we're being written. I hereby declare... my last will to be... ...that everything I own shall be equally shared... ...between the six Sint brothers... ...except for my inheritance... WHAT? All that I inherited from my mother... was this medallion... and I'd really like Maria to have it. That alright with you? No, that's nice. Sigge, I have a request of you... Will you give this to Maria, if...? Yes, she'll get it in the morning. I mean, IF anything should happen to you... tomorrow. You're just too kind, Sigge. Now write! You really are, Sigge! Write... ...from my... But you're... ...mother Yes, yes, that's fine... ...her medallion. Yours faithfully... Harry Or... ...var Larsson. Now it needs to be witnessed. Sit down and sign it! G. Karlsson. No, no! Surname, too... Thanks for your help, boys! No, this is something I'll do myself. Now it's time to get to work. I'm not feeling so good. Don't joke, guys. You're late today. We're just on our way. Here you are. Off you go! You lead the way! Get moving! One tap, and it's all done. Isn't he too far to the right? Yes, he is. Hey, boys... You have to be careful where they fall. That could have turned out bad. What a bad luck! Fate is against us. Calm down, boys...! Tomorrow is another day! I've thought of you all day, Maria. Especially when that tree fell. You've become my guardian angel. I'm be happy to be that in reality. Would you like that? Peacefulness surrounds you. You're unscathed by anything. You're really embarrassing me. Maria, there's something good in everybody. Maria... Maria, there's something I want to ask you... ...but I don't know if I dare. What? Tell me, will you... Will you come dancing with me on Saturday? Love to. Just promise me that you'll be really careful in the forest in future. Now we'll allot the jobs... Harry, you climb up and lop the top off. Boys, the time is ripe! Yes, it's ripe! Hope I have time... Quick! A couple more blows... Look at our little canary sitting up there. He'll soon have his wings clipped! God, how beautiful the world is! It's so good to be alive! Thank God I'm in time! Boys, you have to be careful... I might've been killed. Go and strip the bark off that fir! I've got another idea... Hail-fellows-well-met! You masters of the fallen fir! How could you not admire this wondrous peaceful day?! How kisses not the sun upon our souls? No! Look here my friends... I see you are hell-bent with a fallen fir. How great it is to see you again, dear friend! Let me embrace you... You son of a complex society! Allow the roving apostle of indolence clasp you to his breast! Why are you here? Looking for work? Work? I do not take that despicable word to my lips. Do pigs fly? Do eagles swim in the ocean? I'm sorry... I spoke without thinking. Forget it, my friend! I'm on my way to The Ambassador... I might find some friendly people to stake me... ...to quench my thirst there, and sate the hunger I bear. Come, dear friend. Out of the way, lumberjacks! DANCING EVENING He must be dead tonight. At noon tomorrow, it's too late. No, not too fast! It has to be a neat job! I'll call for you later. - Why? - To pay. You pay now. Two beers! Didn't you hear me? Two beers! Are you paying? It costs 60 ore. This is 62. Keep the change! Don't push your luck! I'd have been more generous if I'd accepted Sigge's loan. It's fine as it is. Shall we dance? How about getting the songstress over? What'll it be? You're the epitome of slowness. You are equal to the snail. You are the very incarnation of my philosophy of life. Toot-toot! "Hurry slowly..." That's enough... What do you want? My newly acquired brother here wants to shout me a glass... ...of your fragrant nectar. Isn't that so, son of a lumberjack? Yes, of course. Okay, one beer. Execute that request... ..you ale-bearer, of down-at-heel shoes and wrinkled stockings. Six beers! BEER FROM THE CITY BREWERY 6 beers for table 7! Nice weather lately. Yes, it's been beautiful weather lately. - Yesterday was nice too. - Yes, yesterday was nice. It might be nice tomorrow, too, But that depends on the weather. Harry, what are you thinking about? Allow me to cut in... This table is taken. Yes, it's taken! Maybe we could get a corner of it? Sure you can. Well, there are other tables. No, sit down. Of course you'll sit here. No, no, no, no! Read that! CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL FORBIDDEN ON THESE PREMISES Maria, come into my arms, Maria. I love you, Maria! I love you! Here we go again... Out with the old faithful! Okay, boys, the usual. Why do people have to fight? Why does blood have to flow? Why should so many suffer just for others' excess pride? Peace is now, and always will be the highest poetry of all our lives Why should only the strong then go and knock down all the weak? Okay, we'll go again. Fire! Out of control! Maria! FIRE INSURANCE POLICY Have you seen Maria? Not since the fire started. Have you seen Maria? She's probably still in there. Oh, sorry, I'll fill it up! Have you seen my friend Harry Orvar? Yes, he's still inside. We tried to help him, but... Console yourselves, oh wanderers... Today you're red, tomorrow dead. C'est la vie, n'est pas? That won't be any help? Won't it? It's kerosene. Don't be stupid! What did I tell you? She's still out to it. So we'll shoot off to catch the train. This is going to make us millionaires! Are you sure Harry got burned up? I shoved him into the fire myself. And we're his heirs! We shan't inherit everything. He left this medallion to Maria. What a laugh... that he never knew he was a millionaire! Thanks for what you left us, Harry Orvar Larsson.! What on earth are you doing there?! How did you end up in the beer? Stop that! Come on, I'll help you up. - Shall we dance? - OK Harry...? Harry! Are you hurt? Are you hurt, Harry? Is he hurt? Hurt? He's as full as a goog. He stinks of cheap booze. It was nice of you to help him home. Oh, that's alright, don't mention it! Harry, listen to me. You're a millionaire. Just look at you! Where did you get the alcohol from? Harry... where have you been? Harry, can't you listen to me? If we are not there before noon, then we're going to lose the money. Come on! We have to catch the train! Excuse me! I only take 5. One stays behind. That's you. Serviced to right time. Calm down... We let him get the money, and then... We have the will. We'd just be looking after our interests. I'm Harry Orvar Larsson, the millionaire's heir. Really? I'm sorry, but you've come too late. The new heir Anton Bodin has already claimed the inheritance. That's my old friend, the philosopher. He doesn't like money. He despises money. Is he your friend? Maybe he's willing to share with you. No, no... Money, money... I'm sorry, I'll take care of that. Thanks. I can't walk much more. I'm hungry, too. Does money really mean so much to you, Maria? Money means an awful lot, Harry. Always has, always will. Money makes people happy. People fight over money. Countries go to war over money. Money has taken control of us. We can't eat without it. I think I've got... Yes I think... No, it was the lumberjacks' wills. What's this...? The toy... Like to earn a fiver? Would I ever! Take over my job. I have to go to the maternity hospital. We're fixed for dinner, Maria! ROYAL MINT BANKNOTE DESTRUCTION DEPARTMENT Put all this into the oven. You'll be paid afterwards. I was throwing money in! Money... What's this stupidity? You can't burn money, can you? It's condemned money... It has to be destroyed! They're to be destroyed! Show me your hand! Other hand! Both hands! What is this? They'll be burnt. They're my wills! Get on with your work! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Burn it! Farewell! It's hard, Maria. Maria! Bertil! Where on earth have you been? I've been trying to find you... Why? I love you. If you only knew how I've cursed myself. Maria, let me look after you. I can even clean up your dad's affairs. I can give you security... ...tenderness and love. Maria... I love you so much! Congratulate me! It was a boy! Is it done? I know I said a fiver, but here's ten. Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria... Maria... Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
