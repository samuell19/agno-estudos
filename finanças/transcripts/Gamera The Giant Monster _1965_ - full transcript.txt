A DAIEI MOTION PICTURE COMPANY PRODUCTION Doctor, we're at the Eskimo encampment. Wow, it's cold. Did they know we were coming? Yes, Dr. Williams of Columbia University contacted them. I see. Oh! That devil's bird! Silent engines to evade detection, you suppose? I wonder which country they belong to? Even in this peaceful Eskimo encampment, the Cold War rages on. CHIDORI MARU This is rough going! Man, it's cold! Skipper, do you think that Dr. Hidaka's party will learn anything from the Eskimos? I certainly hope he succeeds. Skipper, what the hell are they? Several unidentified aircraft, Skipper, what's going on? I have no idea. Are the Superpowers testing A-bombs in the Arctic? No, there was nothing announced to the press. I bet those planes were all carrying nuclear weapons. I'm going to get the scoop on this. At this distance, we should be safe from the fallout.

APANAY (Abdul Apanay) RICHARDSON STRAHAN RONSON BROWN (Hank Brown) HARTMAN Directed by NORIAKI YUASA I seem to remember something... Hey, Doctor! Why bother with this turtle business when World War III could be breaking out? I suppose that you're right. Have we gotten through to the Chidori Maru? No, I haven't been able to with the atmospheric interference. That's unfortunate. Let's return to the Chidori Maru, Mr. Hidaka! This is a legendary stone, handed down from our fathers. Then, this is one of the turtles that lived on the Atlantis Continent? Yes. It is the Devil's Envoy... Gamera! Gamera? Then my assumption was correct! But don't these lines, representing waves, seem odd? Mr. Chief, are these waves? I don't know. Anyhow, it is very frightening. Well, this could be an ominous sign. If they aren't waves, what are they? The implications could be enormous, so I must be cautious. I'm a novice, but they must be waves, since turtles are aquatic. I certainly hope so. The mushroom cloud has dissipated, hasn't it? These tests might change the Earth's axis. They're going to increase typhoons in Japan. Skipper. All hands, abandon ship! All hands, abandon ship! S.O.S. Gigantic turtle sighted. Height, approximately 60 meters. Have you gotten through? We're being jammed, Sir! Very well, evacuate. On the double, abandon ship! Helmsman, abandon ship! On the double! All right, go on ahead. Hey, abandon ship! Have discovered lm here the Chidori Maru sank. But I didn't see either crew or this turtle, NEW YORK Ladies and gentlemen of the world, several thousand years ago, the great continent of Atlantis was said to have stretched to the Arctic Ocean. This was the habitat of a mammoth chelonian, or turtle, known as Gamera. This ancient Eskimo stone tablet tells of the legend. These Gamera were trapped deep in the glaciers and hibernated for thousands of years. Gamera was awoken from beneath his icy tomb by the detonation of an unnamed country's A-bomb. The complement of the Chidori Maru, who witnessed this event, perished. The two of us were off ship with a photographer and were spared. Therefore, we can presume that Gamera is aggressive. However, Gamera was exposed to a massive dose of radiation, so we've surmised that the creature will eventually succumb to this exposure. Frankly, as a zoologist, I regret losing such an invaluable specimen, although, for the sake of mankind the world over I sincerely hope that it has expired and is now at the bottom of the sea. A 60-METER TALL MONSTER? GAMERA REVIVED BY A-BOMB! AMERICA FRANCE GERMANY SOVIET UNION CHINA Oh! A will-d-the-wisp! Strange, I've never heard of one tumbling before. Perhaps it's one of those "Flying saucers" they talk about nowadays? Recently, a rash of flying saucer sightings have been flooding in from around the world. In Japan, an old farmer in nigata Prefecture reported one such sighting. SAUCER-SHAPED OBJECT SEEN OVER CALIFORNIA The whole world is talking about these flying saucers. The Gamera furor is old hat. With the lethal amount of radiation Gamera was exposed to, it's most likely dead by now. I suppose that this is best for the sake of mankind, right? All save for those, excluding three of us, who perished aboard the Chidori Maru, Precisely, no? We ventured out to the Eskimo encampment to gather data on Gamera, and we were spared, weren't we? I never had a chance to tell you this before. When you were preparing to leave the Chidori Maru for the Eskimo encampment, all of the photographers drew lots to see who'd go with both of you. I see. You drew the lucky one, right? Is that so? If I recall, there were eight photographers aboard. The seven who remained paid with their lives. That's right. So, my fate, my very life, was spared by that draw. Oh, my... After we drew, one of the other photographers ordered me a bottle of whiskey to trade places with him. He tried his damndest. He probably wanted to be out in the open and on the dog sleds, right? Yeah, but there was another reason. All of the photographers wanted... Kyoko, they really wanted to go along with you. What? In the end, I was spared, right? Kyoko. Kyoko, you're my Goddess of Good Luck! Oh, my... That's not... No, no, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. HOKKAIDO Miss Sakurai. Oh, Mr. Ueda. I've been meaning to call on you. Has Toshio done something? Well, I thought that I should inform you directly... It's this. Oh, not again! Yes. Toshio seems absorbed in drawing and writing about turtles, doesn't he? While that isn't bad in of itself he brings turtles with him to school and refuses to play with the other children, which is a problem. He brings turtles to school? Right. Due to your father's work, Toshio has had to transfer schools. Ours would be his third transfer am I right? Yes. When he was a baby, we lost our mother... Please tell him to keep the turtles at home, so I don't have to. I'm so sorry to have caused you any trouble. Oh, he really did it this time! Say, Father? Hmm? Will you be working late tonight, again? Well, there's no rest for lighthouse keepers! But you're always taking naps, though. May I be excused? Toshio! What are you doing with this? Were you going to feed this to your turtle? Father, please talk to him! Toshio. Your sister and I know how you feel about your little turtle. Come over here. Now, wouldn't it be terrible if you grew up to hate human beings? That's not right. We can't live in seclusion, can we? Let the turtle go free. Then it can return to its home. You need to forget all about turtles. If you let it go, he'll buy you whatever you like. That's right, I will. What's the thing that you want most? The thing I want most is... What? What is it? To keep my turtle! Toshio! Your sister and I are doing this for your own sake! You'd better mind us, or I'll set it free while you're at school! Now, as your father, I don't want to be mean, do I? So, you're going to have to do this yourself. You understand, don't you? Pee-wee! Behave yourself! I'll come and see you tomorrow morning, okay? Toshio! It's time for your bath! Big sis! What's the matter? Funny kid. What? Toshio? What is it? Father! Gamera! It's a turtle! Hey, run for it! Toshio! Toshio! Toshio! Father! Toshio! Save me! Save me! Toshio! Toshio! Toshio! Are you all right, Toshio? Toshio! To-chan! Please be all right! Toshio, you're safe now! He's all right. Was that the same Gamera from the newspapers, just now? Gamera just went away. How did I get down here? Gamera. It was Gamera who saved you! What? Gamera saved me? Thank goodness for that! Thank goodness! Yes, thank goodness! You're Dr. Hidaka? Yes. Do you know that Gamera was seen in Hokkaido? No, I did not. So, you were wrong that it was at the bottom of the sea? Mr. Hidaka, please go to the information desk, You'll have to excuse me. I have to go. Hey! Please. Thank you. Hello? This is Hidaka. Yes. I understand. I'll leave immediately. Ms. Yamamoto, that was Dr. Murase in Hokkaido. Gamera was seen in his vicinity. What? Purchase a pair of tickets, please. Yes, Doctor. Doctor! And me? We'll see you later! Ah, Doctor! Here's a special news bulletin, Search planes of the Self Defense Forces are on the hunt for Gamera... Scary, isn't it? We will inform you when the creature is found... Where's Toshio? Please keep your televisions and radios switched on... He's fast asleep. He's gone. Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee! Pee-wee, where did you go? Oh, I've got it! I bet Pee-wee changed into Gamera! Hey! You... Mr. Aovagi.. The three of us escaped death together, so we're in this all the way, right? But, what about your job at the newspaper? Oh, they just assigned me to Hokkaido to get pictures of Gamera. Kyoko, you're my Goddess of Good Luck, right? I'll follow you wherever it takes me! Mr. Aoyagi, Gamera hasn't been... Located yet? We must find it soon, before the situation gets worse. What was that sound? It could be an eruption, couldn't it? Strange. Ah! Gamera sighted! Heading directly for the geothermal power plant! Experiencing radio interference! Acknowledge! Are you receiving me? Acknowledge! What was that? What's that noise? What is it? What's up? What was that? An earthquake? WITH WISDOM, WITH STRENGTH 7th DIVISION ARMORED COMMAND: HIGASHI-CHITOSE AIR BASE This way. Let me introduce myself. I'm Dr. Hidaka from the Zoology Department of Tokyo University. I'm his assistant, Yamamoto. And you are? I'm from the Nitto Shimbun, Out of the question.. The press is barred. But Aoyagi has been with us since we started our Gamera research at the Eskimo encampment. He's become our colleague. When it comes to the subject of Gamera, he may have some helpful insight. I see. You can stay. Lieutenant. Yes, Sir! At 17:30, the target, designated "Gamera" demolished the lighthouse at Cape Erimo. It then submerged into the sea, only to reappear 15 minutes later near the Geothermal Power Plant, here. "Geothermal Power Plant"? Please allow me to explain. By boring into the fissures of the Chishima volcanic zone, we release steam reaching temperatures of 1,0000. Then, by channeling this steam into turbine generators, we create electricity. So here you're harnessing this perpetual flow of 1,0000 steam? That's correct. 1,0000 could kill a man instantaneously, right? So, could this be applied against Gamera? It's most unlikely. Gamera was able to withstand the nuclear heat of an A-bomb, so I hardly think that 1000C would have an effect. Then, Doctor, can you please provide us with another countermeasure? Well, then... Do you know this station's maximum output? Yes, Sir. It's 350,000 kilowatts per hour 350,000 kilowatts? It just might work. Command car, command car. please come in, This is the command car, over All units are in position, Roger and out. Doctor, can we commence our attack now? Please hold off. Perhaps we can kill it without artillery. Is that even possible? Please. Thank you. We're ready, Sir. Everything is all set. Doctor, it's approaching the high-tension lines. Connect all switches. Please use the entire 350,000-kilowatt output. It seems that electricity has no effect. You ain't kidding. I don't know what makes Gamera tick, but he seems to be growing stronger from the electricity. Doctor, what does this mean? It means that we've failed. Commander please commence your attack. Commence attack. Commence attack. It looks like it's consuming the flames. Please, cease fire. We can't destroy it. But if we do.. I understand. I need a car. Until I return, please evacuate the local populace. Very well. Thank you. HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES PALEONTOLOGY DEPARTMENT A fire-eating turtle? Yes. Yes. Plato's writings and other ancient legends throughout the world have mentioned fire-eating creatures. These accounts are apocryphal to us now, aren't they? Gamera must have an Achilles' heel, right? Unknown. At the moment, there is only one thing I can say for certain. What is that? Cellular tissues of Gamera's body must be so dense that they are more resilient than our strongest alloys. Also, it has the ability to consume inorganic matter and then processes it into organic matter. Then, Doctor, you're saying that all conventional weapons are ineffective against Gamera? Precisely. Therefore, the energy released by nuclear fusion will only succeed in nourishing it. Then A-bombs and other nuclear weapons are also useless? Now, the markings on this legendary stone.. I can only presume they are ocean waves. We also came to the same conclusion. Perhaps a greater truth lies within this rudimentary form of Eskimo expression. Commander, I suggest nuclear missile support from the U.S. Forces. Yes, it seems we have no choice. Contact the U.S. Forces' command HQ, ASAP. Don't be mean to him! Stop shooting him! Gamera doesn't want to be bad! Oh, Doctor! Well, has the situation changed? Yes, we're going to take it out this time. The U.S. Forces will be launching a nuclear missile strike against it. Commander, the nuclear missiles are standing by and ready for launch. Very good! Stand by to launch. Please wait for a moment. Please don't shoot him! Don't shoot! Toshio! Don't shoot him anymore! Commander, this boy has a point. Please call off the nuclear missile launch. And why is that? This is our last option. Gamera is wallowing in that inferno out there. Massive radioactivity would only further elate it. But, Sir.. And it will end up causing more destruction. I see. Very well. You, call off the attack. Yes, Sir! Mister, thank you. Thank you for saving Gamera. Gamera's not really bad. All turtles are good, aren't they? Certainly. And I pray that you're right. Commander! Oh. The plant has been completely depleted and is beyond repair. Carry on. Doctor, you just heard the report. It seems that after consuming all of that energy, it is virtually unstoppable. Hidaka, do you have any possible suggestions? Yes. Sometimes an opposite strategy can be applied. Perhaps it may succumb under direct exposure to extremely low temperatures. We may want to try devising some sort of strategy against Gamera that we could dub "Operation Deep Freeze." "Operation Deep Freeze"? That's one possible solution, isn't it? There may be something we can use, but I can't guarantee its value. Our weapons lab is in the midst of testing an experimental bomb that freezes its target, which may work. My! It freezes anything it comes into contact with? That's right. It's a top-secret military project. One possible application would be in jungle warfare, freezing all forms of flora and fauna. Commander, what's the progress on practical research? We have completed several test bombs. Please allow the use of these freeze bombs against Gamera. I concur Unfortunately, there is one drawback at this juncture. What is that? The freeze bombs are only effective for ten minutes. Past that time, the ice begins to thaw. So, we can ensnare Gamera for only ten minutes. Yes, to the second, I'm sorry to say. Gamera is on the move. Gamera is on the move. Gamera is on the move, It seems that we have no time to lose. Let's give it a go. We have to risk everything on ten minutes! Gamera is heading towards Hell's Rock. Roger that. We must do something. Below Hell's Rock is a hot springs resort. Let's hurry. Yes, Sir. The freeze bombs are only effective for ten minutes, so you must complete your work within that time. Do I make myself clear? If the dynamite is placed incorrectly, we will only be making Gamera happy We only have one chance at this. Please be careful. We're ready, Dr. Hidaka. Please proceed. So, that's the freeze bomb. It looks as though he's slowing down. Oh, the freeze bombs are as good as we had hoped! Doctor, we're counting minus ten minutes! I understand! Move out! Hurry! On the double! Pick up the pace! There's less than ten minutes left! Gamera's movements are increasing! The freeze bombs are only effective for ten minutes. How much time do we have left? Just about five minutes. Hurry, we're out of time! Men, fall back! Yes, Sir! Clear the area! Hurry, move it! On the double! We only have three minutes left. Doctor, our ten minutes are up! It's all right! We'll make it. All clear! Ready and standing by! Ready? Stand by to detonate! Detonate! It's turned over on its back! Doctor, what's our next move? Once on their backs, turtles are unable to right themselves. Now we just have to wait for it to perish from starvation. Hurrah! Congratulations to you, Doctor! If it expires right here, we will have an invaluable specimen to work with! Hey, look! Gamera's pulling in all fours! Looks like he's ashamed of losing! A turtle that can f-fly? Ms. Yamamoto, the Eskimo stone! Yes, Sir! Doctor, the legend has been solved. These patterns aren't waves.. They're clouds! This was to indicate that Gamera had the ability to fly! GAMERA VANISHES INTO THE SKY! FLYING SAUCER IDENTIFIED AS GAMERA! That's exactly what I saw that night! Then you really saw Gamera? Right, Grandpa? Yeah, that's right! We see many terrible things if we live too long, right? That's true. Are you all right? I'm good! Watch it, Kid! What're you doing with these stones? Did you bring them from Hokkaido? Have you been hiding these from your sister? Tosh-chan! It's Gamera's house! What? "Gamera's House"? Pee-wee turned into Gamera. DEFENSE AGENCY GAMERA COUNTERMEASURES HQ Now, Gamera has been continuously flying around the world. It's frustrating that we can't predict its next appearance, isn't it? Well, it could be worse. We should be grateful that it hasn't attacked any populated areas yet. True. Come in. Go ahead. Hello! How do you do? Toshio, what brings you here? Well, I told them to call on us if they ever came to Tokyo. But I didn't expect to see them so soon. Yes. The truth is, Gamera destroyed our lighthouse. The lighthouse and our living quarters are now being rebuilt, so for the time being, we're going to stay with our uncle in Tsukiji. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that. Toshio, you can see quite a bit of Tokyo from here. Look over there, and you can see Tokyo Tower. Doctor? Where is Gamera right now? Well... We're searching for it, too. Wherever he is, I bet he's feeling lonely. Gamera's not bad. Honest. He's a gentle animal. Please excuse him.. He's overly fond of turtles. No, but it's still true! Gamera's lonely and he doesn't have any friends. He's probably hungry and looking for food, too. Pee-wee's small and Gamera's big, but they are really the same. Really they are! I just know they are! UOKUNI FISH SHOP Oh, uncle! Isn't it a shame we arrive just when your business drops off? I feel terrible about it. You shouldn't feel bad. It's not your fault. Business is down because all we have is this canned crap here. Ichiro-chan, wait up! Toshio! Gimme back my stones! Search me! I don't have 'em! You're a liar! You took them from me! I don't know what you're talking about! Ichiro, if you have them, give them back! I don't know anything about them! I saw you. You went and threw them in the river, didn't you? Hey, you'd better 'fess up! Well, Toshio-chan wouldn't show them to me, so I tossed 'em out. You're such a brat! Always getting into trouble! Toshio-chan, don't worry! I'll buy you some new stones, okay? They can't be replaced! Toshio! For a freeloader, he's a real jerk. Haven't you done enough, you idiot! It's all right, Uncle. It's best that they were thrown away, after all. Listen, Tosh-chan. You're a big boy, and you shouldn't act like this. Crying won't bring them back. At the river, there are a lot of others just like them. Toshkchan, you understand, don't you? Tosh-chan? What? Asleep already? In our findings on Gamera, we've ascertained that firstly, it is attracted to and consumes fire. Secondly, via jets, it can propel itself through the air. Additionally, it also seems to possess an internal power plant of sorts. This emits a signal frequency that can jam radio communications. Here is the aftermath of its attack on the geothermal power plant. All communications were disrupted by an unusual radio frequency. We assume that this was due to the presence of Gamera. In order to store up its energy reserves, Gamera consumes inorganic resources. Not only does it consume petroleum, as well as other mineral and fossil fuels, but Gamera may also seek out A-bombs and other nuclear energy sources for nourishment. Mr. Director. Have you heard the news? This is serious. Currently, we have 33,000 grams of uranium and 300,000 curies of isotope. It's highly probable that Gamera's natural instincts will lead it here. We must conceal this "Food source" from it, shouldn't we? Yes, out of Gamera's reach... But where? TSUKIJI FISH MARKET With all of the fishing dried up, I've gotta think about a better gig. Yeah. It's weird that all of the fish off of the Pacific Coast died. It really is. This is the first time it's ever happened. Something must really be wrong with the Earth, huh? NEWS ANCHOR MR. ONO In Tokyo, the Koto district was struck with unusual tidal flooding. 260 homes were seriously damaged, while an additional 1,000 homes suffered minor damage. Now, let's go to our filmed report. The cause of the sudden flooding is still unknown. While meteorologists are at a loss as to why only this area of Tokyo Bay was affected, this disaster is still under investigation by authorities. The flooding and the current fishing crisis are posing serious social and economic repercussions. Meanwhile, faulty radio communications are responsible for a series of shipping accidents in Tokyo Bay. A Greek oil tanker relying on a faulty radio beacon, collided with another vessel. However, this accident has been attributed to poor atmospheric conditions. Now, our cameras take you to the Defense Agency's Gamera Countermeasures HQ for a press conference with Dr. Hidaka. While we have not determined the cause of these mysterious incidents in Tokyo Bay... Now, this is strictly my personal opinion, but I am certain that Gamera is behind these incidents. Will you please elaborate? Yes. Based on our data and a preponderance of evidence, we should assume that, at this very moment, Gamera is hiding at the bottom of Tokyo Bay. In order to Investigate these mysterious incidents, an enclave of international scientists, including American and Soviets, has convened in Japan. Gentlemen, as it currently stands, I regret to inform you that we have not surmised a method of eradicating Gamera. All conventional means have proven to be absolutely ineffective against it. Mr. Murase, before we departed New York, the U.N. apprised us of a potential solution. Would you please share with us? It is to utilize the expansive project you're building off of Izu at Oshima Island that has been dubbed the "Z Plan." Oh, the Z Plan? The Z Plan is practically infallible! It's our best solution concerning Gamera. On Oshima Island, a massive international research project is being undertaken. America and the Soviet Union have also both committed their technical expertise to this project, The purpose of this research center is human progress through scientific advancement. Construction of which is taking place atop a mountain over looking the sea. Then, suddenly... This is Haneda Control Tower. This is Haneda Control Tower. This is Haneda Control Tower. This is Haneda Control Tower. Please respond. This is Haneda Control Tower. What the hell is that? It's Gamera! Everyone, please evacuate! Evacuate! Gamera's coming! Hurry, everyone! Hey, didn't you hear that? It's Gamera! Clear out! Do any of you care about your fives? Man, what's the big deal? What's Gamera? Nothing's gonna stop this shindig! So let's dance! You fools! Think about your families! Even you have parents, don't you? It's Gamera! Citizens of Tokyo! Citizens of Tokyo! You are hereby ordered to evacuate! Please evacuate to the suburbs! I repeat: Citizens of Tokyo! This is a special news bulletin! This is a special news bulletin! At 7:30 PM, Gamera appeared at Haneda Airport and... Tosh-chan, give me a hand! It's too dangerous here! We're being evacuated to Hachioji in the morning, Tosh-chan! Hey, Toshio! Please, Gamera, don't do anything bad. We're leaving in ten minutes. Do you know where Toshio's gotten to? No, I don't. Toshio! Mr. Hidaka, while Plan Z is in our hands, you are indispensable for your knowledge of Gamera. We, all of the world's scientists, are at your disposal in full cooperation and technical support. On the behalf of the Japanese people, I thank you. It will take another 24 hours before Z Plan will be ready. What can we do to keep Gamera at bay until then? Well, as a zoologist, I believe that its violence stems from a limited energy supply. At present, it is at an oil refinery, consuming fire, its primary nourishment. Those fires should burn out within eight hours. Hidaka, in order to ensure minimal damage, Gamera should be confined to that area. I concur. Then we must bring in more petroleum to keep the fires burning. At this rate, we'll lose all of our storage tanks. Yeah. Got it. Hey! Move 'em out! Right! Hello? This is the refinery. Ah, yes! Dr. Hidaka? Yeah, got it. Everyone, listen up! We have to keep at it for another 24 hours, so please do your best! Right! Only 24 hours more! Do your best! Right! Gamera! Chief, there's a kid on that tank wagon! Damn it. Gamera! Kid, you're in serious danger Get down! Come on! I don't want to! I don't want to! Let go of me! Let go of me! I don't want to! I don't want to! Are you out of your mind? I don't want to! Let go of me! Hey. Hey! Let go of me! Let go of me! What's wrong with you, Boy? Go on home! Mister, Gamera's my friend! I know, I know. Now, go on home! Are you all right, Chief? I'm fine. Go! Gentlemen, I'm proud to announce that the Z Plan at Oshima is now ready. The technical prowess of the entire world has been concentrated on achieving and completing this project. Now, the pressing question is how we will be able to lure Gamera to Oshima? We cannot implement Z Plan if we cannot lure Gamera to the island. I do have an idea that may work. Mr. Hidaka, you have the floor In order to ensure that Gamera will land at Oshima, we... And thus, the Z Plan was set into motion. Evacuation of the residents has begun, and Oshima is designated as off-limits to civilians and the press. GAMERA COUNTERMEASURES HQ So, Aoyagi, it's goodbye for the time being? We're a team. Shutting me out now isn't fair, is it? The media is being barred, so I guess you're resigned to it? I really hate saying goodbye to my Goddess of Good Luck. By the way, Dr. Murase's in Kawasaki. You should be able to get direct reports from there. Right. Well, then... Goodbye. Man your posts! Now hear this! Man your posts! MARITIME SAFETY AGENCY, KAWASAKI Have Hidaka and the others landed at Oshima? Yes. We're shipping over materials and supplies now. I hope that Gamera can be lured to Oshima. TO PLAN Z RESEARCH CENTER, OSHIMA ISLAND Ready! Take her away! Sir, you have a visitor. Nobuyo? What is it? We were preparing to evacuate to Hachioji, but Toshio disappeared. All he could talk about was Gamera, so I thought... Toshio? Hello? Yes, yes, that's right. The last shipment is here. Take it to the temporary HQ. Yes, Sir! Hello? How's it coming along? Yes, this is step one of the Z Plan. Don't! Don't! Let go of me! What's with giving us the business? Knock it off! What's going on? Doctor, we have a stowaway! A stowaway? My! Toshio? Now, go on! I was worried about Gamera. Toshio, you can stay now, but don't get in the way. Toshio, shall we go over there? Well... Everyone, we are about to commence. Mr. Hidaka, is it possible to lure Gamera here? Absolutely. We'll have to begin now, due to a typhoon warning. Hello, this is Oshima. We are commencing Z Plan. Hurry! On the double! Take up your positions! There's good news, Nobuyo! Toshio's on Oshima Island! I'm so relieved! Hello, this is Oshima. This is Oshima. The tanker has arrived. Please commence, Doctor. All right. Understood. Please begin. Begin! Stand by! It's moving towards it! Doctor! It's a success! Hidaka, we've done it! Gamera is moving away from us! I understand! Everyone, Gamera is on its way! Hello? Hello? Yes, we're at the ready! Doctor, is it here? Now, have patience. Here's a typhoon bulletin. It has suddenly changed direction, bearing NE, and is now headed for the Japanese coastline. Its central pressure is 960 millibars with a maximum speed of 50 meters per second... Dr. Hidaka, what shall we do? It should be nominal if it reaches the island. Gamera! Gamera's approaching! Gamera's approaching! Gamera's approaching! Gamera! Don't come here! Gamera, don't come here! Don't come here! Gamera, this way! Keep coming this way! Damn it! It's beginning to rain! Damn it! The fire's... Damn it! Damn it! That's all we had! We were so close! Mr. Hidaka, how about using the fuel for the Z Plan? We can't risk it! But.. It would deplete the fuel intended for Z Plan! Doctor! Who're you? What're you doing? You, stop it right there! Oh, it's Mr. Aoyagi! Let me go! Let me go! We've got to burn it! Have you lost your mind? Or are you after another scoop? The island's off-limits to the press, right? Since I wanted to help you, I came over as a laborer. But to start setting fires! No! Doctor, make it burn bigger and brighter! Gamera loves fire, so create a bonfire to lure him ashore! Now I see! All right! Everyone, give us a hand! Keep it burning! Damn it! We've lost. Doctor! Gamera! We did the best we could. Unfortunately, we can't beat the elements. Damn it, this is maddening! That's it! Gamera's coming! The eruption has subsided. Right. It's a fortunate break for the Z Plan. Let's set her down. It's Dr. Murase. Big sis! Big sis! Toshio! Your big sis.. I'm sorry, but scold me later! We're going to miss the Z Plan! Wow, it's impressive! Isn't it! I like it here. Hurry along, Toshio! Or you'll be left behind! Hidaka, congratulations! We've finally done it. Thank you! We are commencing Operation Z! Step one! Now, step two! Step three! Z Plan, begin countdown. People of all nations. people of all nations! The scientists of the world completed the interplanetary Z Plan rocket and have successfully launched Gamera to Mars. We could not vanquish Gamera on Earth. And so it was dispatched to the barren Martian plains. The Z Plan was mankind's last hope. And under a fellowship without ideological borders, it was a resounding success. Mr. Hidaka, congratulations! Thank you! Mr. Murase, congratulations! Ms. Yamamoto, take a break from our research and be Aoyagi's Goddess for a change. Doctor, I'm sorry! Toshio, are you lonely now that Gamera's gone? No, I'm not, Doctor. I'll become a scientist like you, and go and visit him one day! Gamera, goodbye! THE END
