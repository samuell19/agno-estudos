[ can pops open ] [ spitting ] [ outer door opens ] [ outer door closes ] [ knocking on door ] - Vince! - Hey, man. - This is great! - Yeah! This is great, man! How are you?! - I can't complain. - Yeah. Cool, cool. Totally, it is. I'm very psyched. Oh. You should be, Johnny. This is a great thing. - Thanks, man. - It's great to be alive! Totally. Vince: Shit. Clear! [ laughing ] - What's up, man? - Nothing much. - John: You're not dressed. - Lay off. It's not that I don't like it-- - Vince: What? - Nothing. - Vince: So? - John: So nothing. - Okay. - Okay. Excellent. [ John laughing ] I swear to God, man, you get stranger every year. You look good, John. Where's Leah? She didn't make the trip. Why not? We broke up. Shut up. - I'm serious. - Shut up! - Man, I'm serious. - You broke up? - We broke up. - Why? Uh, complicated. Why? Oh, she didn't like the way I dress. - Come on. Don't joke, man. - Actually I'm not. Tell me what happened. Oh, I get stranger every year. - Come on, Vince! - What, man?! She thinks I am a dick! She sends her apologies for not coming. She says she's sure it's gonna go, you know, fine. I don't believe it. She does. - Why did you break up? - Hey, hey, I don't know! - John: Sorry, man. - Yeah, man. Me too. [ punches wall ] Well... what, is it permanent? Vince: Permanent as a dead horse, amigo. Vince. [ flushing toilet ] Come on, what did you do? Why did you say that? - Because I know you. - What, you think I'm a dick? Uh... no. Uh... but I do know that occasionally... you have a tendency to act in a phallic fashion. - I'm not like that anymore. - You're not a dick? - Vince: No. - You're not a dick anymore? [ grunting ] - You see what I mean? - Hey, I'm just asking what happened. Well, a lot of things. Like? Like, I don't know. Like she says I'm reckless. All right? - What, in general? - Vince: Yeah. Okay, you weren't specifically reckless recently? Not particularly specifically. No. - Be honest, Vince. - I am. - Did you fuck around? - No! - Vince! - I didn't. So what happened? Uh... she thinks I have violent tendencies. - Oh boy. - John, I never touched her. I never said you did. Yeah, well, she thinks I have "unresolved issues, which occasionally manifest themselves in potentially violent ways." What? John: I think it's fair to say she has a point. Yeah, well, no one's saying she doesn't have a point. - John: So? - So what, she's got to break up? She's probably scared. God. Of what? I never threatened her. You sometimes present a threatening appearance. [ breathes deeply ] Dude, we've been going together for three years! So what? So, I mean you'd think she'd be used to it by now. That's a tricky one, Vin. Jesus! What's tricky? I'm just saying, it's tricky. Women these days have no reason to hang around... potentially violent guys. It's not an attractive quality to them anymore. Too many other guys out there with resolved violent tendencies. - Oh, so I'm out of fashion. - John: Look, don't be a fool. Well, don't be a politically correct fuck. Hey, I'm not. I'm telling you, you're an idiot if you think chicks are gonna put up with your bullshit. What bullshit? - Uh... like playing rough. - I didn't play rough with her. - Vince. - Vince: What? - I love you. - Oh great. - But come on... - Vince: What? - You don't not play rough. - I totally do not play rough! [ grunting ] Fuck! Okay, man. Look, I'm just sorry you broke up. All right? I'm sorry for you both. Don't be sorry for that bitch. Fine, Vince. I'm just sorry for you. Okay? Next subject. Vince: Well... she says if I get my act together, keep going to the meetings... stop being a dick... then she might consider talking to me again. Good. That's great, man. Should we get some dinner? Vince: I got to wait for a call. From whom? Vince: None of your business. - From Leah? - Vince: No. Okay. Vince: Hey, you ready for your big day tomorrow? - You're mad. - Vince: I'm not mad. Hey, buddy, you're allowed to be. Vince: I'm not mad. Don't be a fag, okay? I'll find somebody else. That's true. Vince: ...who appreciates my dark side. Yeah, you know, but the thing is, if you could maybe find a way to learn something from all this, then you wouldn't have as large a dark side. Learn what? Learn to deal with some of your violent tendencies. Oh yeah? How? By acknowledging them. Right? John: By making some type of... truce with yourself, where you're not in constant battle to prove your integrity or self-worth, you know, whatever it is you think nobody gets about you. I don't think there's anything to get about me. Vince, your idea of manhood is putting on Eddie Cochrane and screwing your girl. Okay? Hey, I'm a simple man. Well, it's not like that anymore. Women want other things. Yeah, well, what do they want? I don't know, guys who don't put their fists through windows, who don't throw phones across the room... who don't stalk their girlfriends across 16 states. All right, all right. All right. Where they got you staying? John: Uh, they got me over in town, at the Radisson. Nice. Yeah, it's nice. Lansing Film Festival! Yeah... that and Cannes. Hey, still it's a good gig. It's a good cheap thrill. Why you got to dump on it? It's a good gig. I got big expectations. I spent two years of my life on this film. I want it to be... you know, at a theater near you. Yeah, well it is. It's playing right over-- Yeah, but you had to come all the way to the middle of fucking Michigan to be there. For one screening. All you need is one of those guys from... whatever, right, Disney, to be there tomorrow. They see it, they like it, boom! Next thing you know, you're directing Free Willy IV. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey! - Hey! Dude, come on. I'm starving. Yeah. What time is it? John: It's quarter of. You want a beer? John: Aren't you supposed to be getting your act together? I'll wait till I get back. Oh, this is, this is good. Okay, Vince! Right here. This is what she's talking about. Right here. [ burps ] John... if I wanted to hang out with my mom... Well put. Vince: And besides, what Leah don't know won't hurt her. What do you got going on in that bag, Vince? Uh... beer. How much? Vince: Hmmm... A lot. [ screaming ] - Jesus, man. - [ laughing ] I don't know why I said you had violent tendencies. Oh, why? John: The warm beer, the boxers, the Motor Palace. Who needs Betty Ford? We can't all be at the Radisson, can we? - You wanna come stay with me? - No. I thought you'd be with Leah, that's why I didn't offer earlier. Vince: It's not a problem. It's not a problem. They gave me a double. 11th floor, overlooking the park. Still, you probably want to get laid. That's true. It's your big weekend, man. Chicks are gonna flock to you. Oh, you're right. No. I'll be fine here. Cool. Should I twist your arm? Little bit more. - Prick! - Putz. - Suck ass! - Schmuck! Ahh! Ahh! I appreciate you coming all the way out here, man. Seriously. We've come a long way. Vince: Since? I don't know. High school. You think? Some of us. Dude, I'm totally giving you shit. - No, but you're right. - No, man. I'm not! Let's face it, you are. John: I'm right only in that I think you can do better than you are. Vince: Why? Because I believe in you. If I didn't, we wouldn't still be friends. And I probably couldn't say that to you. Why not? Because it sounds totally pretentious. - You're right. - But the thing is, I mean it. John: No, look, I'm sorry, but it's like this whole thing with Leah. If it is permanent, then you should view it as an opportunity to... change. Change what? I don't know. Find a new job... - I like my job. - What is your job? - Volunteer firefighter. - Oh, right. How do you make your money? - Lay off, John. - I'm just saying... What? It's just a little immature. Well, you try doing it. - That's not the point. - Besides... the majority of my clients happen to be, like, over 50. Okay? So, if that's not mature, then I am baffled as to what is. Okay. Private dope delivery to ex-hippies does not a mature man make, Vince. It's no different than standing on the corner and selling to teenagers. Why are you lecturing me? - Hey, I'm not lecturing anybody. - You are. - I'm just pointing a few things out. - Such as? Such as, yes, I think you can do better. Better than what? Better than-- better than pissing your life away. Vince, look, you're smart, right? So why are you still dealing drugs? Because I am smart. All right? If I were dumb I would've gotten caught. Besides, I am a firefighter. - You deal to the fire chief. - He needs me. That's not the point. Why is what you do better? Why is what I do better? Yeah. Why is what you do better? Okay. What I'm trying to do is better because... ...it's an attempt at figuring things out. I would like to eventually become good enough at it to the point where I can contribute-- All right, fuck you. Seriously, where I can contribute to a larger debate about why this country's so fucked up. Like for example, why is it that a 50-whatever-year-old fire chief feels the need to get stoned every night? Right? What is it about life in America that's driving that urge in him? He likes it? Fine, but then there's something slightly wrong with the fact that someone with that type of responsibility is constantly high. I'm serious. Maybe there's something worth exploring there. His firehouse happens to have the best record in the city. If my house was on fire, I wouldn't want his high ass anywhere near it. Listen, man, you are so up yourself. If the guy has a good record, it's because he's lucky. - That's it. - Says who? It's obvious, man. He's living this big, luck-driven lie. - Get real, are you high? - No. I'm serious. You're making movies about guys who rob Popeye's Fried Chicken. Hey! Hey, I am telling a story... which aims to resonate the notion of where our society's headed if we're not careful. If it sounds a little pompous, it's only because I haven't fully honed my skills yet. It doesn't sound pompous. It sounds... like you're talking out of your ass. Why? Because you have no idea where society is headed, okay? You are just like everybody else, all right? You're just following the latest trend which you hope will get you laid until that trend switches to something else, at which point you'll drop the old one and start making movies about, you know, whatever-- turtles getting caught in fishing nets. You don't like my work? I like it, like I like a shot of whiskey first thing in the morning. It's good for about 10 minutes and then I want my coffee. Wow. What? Now you're all sensitive? Did I say something to piss you off? Or is it that you're just a dick? Well, both. Well at least you're finally admitting it. Unlike... some of us. What? That I'm a dick? Yeah. - When? - I was speaking figuratively. When was I figuratively a dick? High school. What? I was too shy to be a dick in high school. Hey, buddy, give yourself a little credit. I think you held your own. That's because everyone's a dick in high school. It's the white male football-playing prerogative. The trick is to evolve into something else once you're out. John, you're wearing $200 shoes. Okay, first of all, that's not true. Oh, what? $150? I'm less shy than I was in high school. Oh, great, so now you're an overt dick. No, I'm a thoughtful person who happens to like nice shoes. And is, occasionally full of shit. Is there something I'm not doing that you want me to do? I don't want you to do anything. No? Because it seems like I'm being asked to do something by a 28-year-old pot dealer who doesn't have the guts to progress with the rest of society. Which would be fine if it was a legitimate rebellion, instead of just some lonely guy hanging out in a motel room wearing boxer shorts acting like a potentially violent dick. You want to get high? No. Come on, John, let's get high. - I'm not getting high. - Oh, why? Only potentially violent dicks get high? - No. - So, let's get high. - I'm not getting high. - Well, I am. Fine. What do you got going on in that bag, Vince? - Pot. - How much? A lot. P for party. A for all night long. R for reefer. T for turn me on. Y for why not? P-A-R-T-Y. Party, party. Let's get high. - Jesus... - [ Vince giggling hysterically ] You know who's out here? - Where? - Here. Lansing. Who? Amy. Amy Randall? Mm-hmm. [ exhales ] Yeah. Tracy told me that a couple of years ago. When I found out that you got this thing, I looked her up on the Net... and she's out here. She's like an assistant district attorney or something. Did you call her? I thought about it. You should, man. Especially now that Leah's... - Out of the picture? - Yeah. Vince: Huh. John: Huh. I wonder if she's-- Still hot? - Yeah. - Not a very appropriate thing to say. Yeah. Okay, you know what? Here's the thing about being appropriate. It's better to try to do that than to be a complete asshole. The choice to respect people is actually a good one, despite people like you, who insist on calling fat people "fat" to their faces. What if they are fat? If they are fat, they probably realize it without you having to remind them. You know, it basically just... comes down to having a couple of manners. Oh, is that what it is? Yep. Then why did you ask if she was still hot, Miss Manners? Because she is. She was. That's-- no, no, that's not a bad word. If the word is essentially a compliment, saying it isn't bad manners. Human beings like to be called attractive. I'm not labelling Amy Randall anything she doesn't know. - I'm sure she's smart too. - Well, then I think we should call her up. And if we find out she weighs 320 pounds, I think that we should say to her, "Gee, we're really glad we dated you in high school instead of now, because back then, you were really hot. And now... I'm sure you realize about now." - John: You know what, Vince? - What? Why don't you just shut up for awhile? Well, I see. So, I made a point, so I should shut up. John: No, it's that you like being rude for the sake of it. Either that or you do it to prove nobody can make you be nice. Either way, it gets tiresome. And you and I don't see each other often enough to make worthwhile this little competition for who's more "authentic," okay? It's not about that anymore, we're just-- we should accept the fact that we're different from each other, and let the friendship go from there. Accept the fact we're different from each other? - John: Yeah. - Would you like to make me? - Make you what? - Accept that fact. No. - Why not? - Because it's stupid. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. No, it's not. How else will I know you're different? - You'll just have to trust me. - No. Prove it. Or else what? Or else, I'll kick your ass. Well, I guess this means you are potentially violent. Only when it comes to you, John. You know, it's funny how you get this way - whenever we talk about Amy Randall. - No, I don't. I don't even think you realize it. - Fuck off, John. - Okay, you know what? - I'm out of here. - Fuck off. - Thanks for coming. - Fuck off! Vince! - Fuck you, John. - Look... I'm sorry you still feel bad about Amy Randall, and every time you get stoned and drunk around me, - this comes up. - Fuck you. It was over 10 years ago. I've explained this to you a million times-- that I thought it was okay for me to be with her because you had broken up, and that I now have a... better understanding as to the fragility of human emotions. And thus, if the situation arose again, I would not let what happened happen. But these things do happen, especially in high school. And I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings. That's not what I'm talking about. What are you talking about? What happened. - So am I. - So... what happened? We slept together. How? - What do you mean, how? - How did you sleep together? Oh, okay, so now this is about that? Is it? I don't know. You tell me. We slept together. Yeah, how? Vince... - you know how. - No, I don't. I mean, I have an idea... but I don't actually know, because... we've never talked about it. We laughed about it. We thought it was kind of funny, but you never exactly told me what happened. Okay... - So what do you want to know? - I want to know what happened. We slept together. How? What do you mean, how? How? You're gonna have to be more specific. In what fashion... - did you sleep with her? - Jesus... We had sex. - And... - And that was it. Was it good sex? - I've had better since. - [ Vince chuckling ] Was it fun? It was all right. Was it on the rough side? It's hard to say... We were both drunk. Did you rape her? Did I rape her? No. Kind of? No. Was it kind of like a date rape? Was it kind of like a date rape? Yeah. Did you kind of force her to have sex with you? No, man. John? I'm not sure what you want me to say. I want you to tell me what happened, all right? You're a filmmaker, okay? Lay out the scene for me. Show me the dailies. You know what? Can we talk about this when you're not high? Maybe the only reason I'm high is so that you would get high, and for once tell me the truth, instead of changing the subject. Okay. It was a little rough, which is something that doesn't make me proud. - Okay? - Did you talk to her after that? - No. - No? Why not? I wouldn't know what to tell her. I'm a completely different person. - Well, maybe she is too. - Maybe. - Maybe she's fat. - That's really not funny. I didn't say it was. - Does anybody know what happened? - I didn't tell anyone. Why not? Maybe you should. Wait-- look, I don't actually consider it a crime. It was not a good thing. It was morally somewhat questionable... and yeah, yeah, I wish it hadn't happened. But it's nothing where I need to turn myself in to the police - 10 years later. - Nobody's talking about the police. - What are you talking about? - I don't know... Her. I think she already knows. Maybe you should apologize. Oh... Jesus! You think I should apologize to her? Yeah, why not? Look, it wasn't even date rape. It was something that got a little out of hand. I thought you weren't sure what date rape was. - I'm sorry, okay? - Don't apologize to me. I'm not. I'm-- what I'm trying to say... is that 10 years ago, I did something... wrong. And that when I think about it now, the person who did that seems like a complete stranger to me. This dumb, drunk high school senior who thought she was being prudish... and needed some coercion. It was bad. I regret it. But it was a far cry from rape. And I don't think she'd call it that either. What do you think she'd call it? - I have no idea. - What if she called it rape? Listen to me. I highly, highly doubt that she even remembers it. You remember it. Yeah, I remember it because it was a pivotal thing for me. - Your first rape? - Don't be an asshole. Look, just tell me why it was pivotal for you. I don't know. It was one of the first times in my life that I looked at myself objectively and made a conscious decision to try to avoid becoming a certain type of person. For her it may have been nothing important one way or the other. For me, it constituted something more significant. Or so you'd like to think. Why are you suddenly so high and mighty? I'm not high and mighty. I'm too high to be high and mighty. Besides, I'm just a lowly, drug-dealing, boxer-wearing scum of the earth, right? - You said it. - No, actually you did. - I didn't mean it like that. - How did you mean it? That you should change your life a little. - This coming from a rapist. - You're an idiot. I'm sorry. This coming from a low-budget film maker who makes movies about, "Where society is possibly headed if he could just forget about the date rape he didn't kind of do." You're seriously disturbed. No, actually, I am high and mighty. I was wrong before. Look, what do you want me to say? - I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing to me. I'm not! I'm apologizing in general. It's something I wish hadn't happened. I don't think I'm an evil person. No one's saying you're evil. It sure as hell feels like it. Do you think you're evil? No. So then, you're not evil. I'm the evil one. You're the morally conscious movie-maker. Whatever. Whatever. - All right, can we stop now? - Totally. Thank you. Jesus. I just think you should call her. - I am not going to call her. - Why not? You should. Just stop, okay? To call her now would be to trivialize the entire thing. I mean, what do I say? "Oh, hey, how's it going? How's your life? Oh, by the way, sorry about the date rape 10 years ago." So you did date rape her? No, I didn't. What did you do? I coerced her to have sex with me. How? Verbally. You verbally coerced her? Yeah, by applying excessive linguistic pressure, I persuaded her to have sex with me. Ah... And then, things got rough? No, things got rough in that, after a while, they became aggressively playful. They did? We did. Meaning what? Meaning that I probably thought I was still being playful, but others might interpret my actions as being... - rough. - I.e., rape. No. Rough. Look, John... only you two know what happened. So only you two can interpret your actions. So why don't you just tell me the facts - and interpret them later? - I am telling you, I argued her into it. You're fucking lying. - What is your problem? - I just don't know how you can sit there with your oldest friend... - and continually tell lies. - Okay, Vince, what makes you think I'm lying? Because only you would come up with "excessive linguistic pressure." Okay? That's not a normal expression. That is a sign of "excessive bullshit," all right? If you had really done only that, you'd be more specific. You'd said you told her if she didn't put out, you'd tell everybody she had VD, or smelled bad, or had a penis, or any of the normal things that guys say. But instead, you come up with your typical crap, which sounds... mature, all right, but contains nothing. And it's bullshit, because the reason why you are where you are today... is because you always insist on getting things your way. That is what you're good at. So why don't you own up and admit what you did? Vince, fuck off. Fine, I'll call her. - Don't do that. - Why not? John: Because I would like you not to. - Why not? - Vince. Vince! You've already made your point. - What's my point? - Your point is that... nobody's perfect, including me, so it offends you when I tell you how you should live your life. That's not my point. - It should be. - Well, it's not. - Why not? - 'Cause I haven't got to my point yet. All right. So get to it. Maybe I don't have one. Then I'm gonna leave. - Wrong. - Right. Admit it. - Admit what?! - Admit what you did to Amy. - What makes you think I did something? - Because I know. - How? - Cause she told me. - Told you what? - What you did. - What did she say? - What? - What did she say? - Nothing. It was obvious, so just tell me what you did - and I'll let you go. - Would you stop being a dick? - Tell me what you did. - Why do you care? - 'Cause I want to hear it. - What would that change? - I don't know. - So why does it matter? We know I did something wrong. - So tell me what you did. - I pinned her arms back and stuck my dick in, okay? For Christ's fucking sakes, shit happens! I already said I'm sorry. Thank you. - What did you just do? - Taped our conversation. Why? Wanted to make sure I heard you right. Tape: So tell me what you did! I pinned her arms back and stuck my dick in, okay? For Christ's fucking sakes, shit happens!... Whoo... you're right. You know? You are a completely different person. I can't believe you just did that. Beer? You're mad? - How could you do something like that? - Like what? - I'm not messing around, Vince! - No, what? It offends you? It offends me fucking immensely. Why? I-- I'm-- All I'm doing is suggest you call up and apologize for the actions of a drunk high school senior. You know that you just ended our friendship. Come on, man. It's a cheap little tape recorder. - It's K-Mart. - Why did you do that? - I'm trying to make a point. - Which is what? - There's something wrong here. - What? Where? With you and I? And everyone else. So, okay, what is it? Do you think everyone should call up and apologize for things they've done wrong in their lives? I don't know. Yeah. You honestly think that would help? You don't think it'd just end up being a bunch of... hypocrites wandering around, raping people, and then apologizing later? - You got a better idea? - Yeah. Not do it next time. - That's it, huh? - Yeah. - You don't think she'd want that? - Want what? The tape. Why would she want that? To know that you admitted it. - Vince. - What? John: Look... I doubt she remembers it happening. Well, then she might want to be reminded. Why? Because if you pinned my arms back and fucked me without permission... I'd want to be reminded. Don't talk like that. That's what you said, right? That's what's on the tape. - This is ridiculous! - Why? Because my apologizing now won't make any difference to her. She's probably dealt with the whole issue and moved on. All right. Maybe she has. But if you're such a different guy than you were 10 years ago, technically you shouldn't mind apologizing for something that the real you didn't even do. Now, on the other hand, if you still are the kind of guy who would do something like that, then I understand you don't want to apologize. You wouldn't want to come across like a hypocrite. Give me the tape, Vince. No way. - Why not? - Because, as you imply to me on a daily fucking basis whenever we spend the day together, I wouldn't have the guts to tell her all the interesting tidbits of information that this tape herewith contains. It'll be much easier to simply hand it to her. If I even have the guts to do that. [ laughing ] You know something? I don't really think I'm hungry. I think I'm gonna skip dinner. You won't give her that tape. It's hard to say. Will you stop being a dick, Vince?! I'm sorry, did you want to do that line? - What will you do with the tape? - Here's what I was thinking. I was thinking about adapting it into a movie. Maybe you could help me with this, and maybe I could have the world premiere at next year's Lansing Festival. Dude, I'm totally psyched! Listen, really you should get going. I'll just tell her you said hi. - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Shit. - She'll be calling at any minute. - Why? She said she'd call at 8:00. Wait a minute. I thought you said you didn't call her. I said I thought about calling her. And then, you see, I actually did, and it's cool. We're hooking up for dinner. Really, you should get going. I probably won't go through with this whole thing. Unless she sees the tape sitting there and we're talking and she keeps pestering me about what's on it. [ phone ringing ] Hello? Hey, Amy. How are you? You still up for some chow? Cool. Hey, did I tell you why I was out here? Yeah, right, the film festival. But the reason for that is-- you remember John Salter, right? Yeah, yeah. Well, he actually made a movie that's being shown as part of the festival. Yeah, and I'm out here for that. He's out here too. He's over at the Radisson. 11th floor, overlooking the park. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know how you want to work this because I'm over here at the Motor Palace on Saginaw. Yeah. Exactly. Cool. Cool. Uh-huh. Well, you know, the thing is I don't have wheels, so... Really? Well, that would be great. 'Cause if you want to just come here and then we'll just take it from there. And you know where it is? Oh, wow. Well, terrific. Then I'll see you in a few, right? Yeah, it's room 19. 19, right. Yeah, yeah, me too. All right. Okay. Bye-bye. Dude, do you think I could borrow a few bucks? Vince... why are you doing this? Well... at first, it was a moral crusade, but now... I don't know, except for that you don't want me to. And that's worth more than our entire friendship? John, come on. I highly doubt if I weren't one of your oldest friends, I would even possess the power to make you think twice about something like this. That's assuming you are thinking twice. There are better ways to go about making someone do that. How? Convincing him with a really good argument? Applying excessive linguistic pressure? Huh? I'm not a very moral guy, John. Much less a... highly articulate poet-filmmaker, all right? I can barely pay my rent, much less convince somebody like you to stop being an asshole. No one's asking you to be articulate, Vince. You pick what is potentially the most important weekend of my life to bring up something I haven't thought about in 10 years! Yeah. I guess so. So, are you staying? Give me the tape, Vince. Mmmm... no. - Just give me the tape. - Why? Because it doesn't belong to you. I bought it... at K-Mart. What's on it doesn't belong to you. Bullshit, all right? I had to be like Aldrich fucking Ames to make this tape. This is the most planned out thing I've done in my whole life. No. It's mine, Vince. I'm going to give it to you, you're gonna destroy it. No, I'm not. What will you do with it? Put it in your closet and not think about it for another 10 years? You know, where did you get this whole self-righteous thing? It's not like you to have a spine. What can I say? I... am a fireman. I'm not leaving until you give it up. Fine, stay as long as you want. Just don't touch my coke. Tell me something. Have you ever done anything you regretted? Yeah. You have. That you never apologized for? Um hmm. So... why are you doing this? It must be... that I have guilt, all right, for all the things I never apologized for... and that I'm taking it out on you. Okay, so then it's irrational. Yeah, I agree. So give me the tape. No fucking way. You know something? I wasn't going to give her the tape at all, except now, with the way that you're acting, it's like I have no choice. [ Vince chuckling ] Listen, you should really get going. She called me from her cell. She's a couple of minutes away. Okay, that's it.
