Or in all these years, have you ever once seen me cry? Hey! How can you not cry? You're lying! Oh yeah! What are you saying? I don't know, I've been this way since I was a child. Even when I was born, apparently I didn't cry. Somehow they kept saying that about me and I ended up never crying. I've tried to, many times. But I couldn't get a single tear. Basically I am a supernatural being. Go away you idiot! Love you Henceforth even you will not shed a tear, nor will I let that happen. He's the first person to like every girl's picture.

Because of me Can you leave? Everything is done... Idiot... Look here, all this is pretty normal Not for me See, it's not a big deal. I have a contact who's a doctor. He's like a friend to me, He will understand. What will he understand? We'll get an abortion Sindhu Why are you shaking your head? I don't understand It means I cannot get an abortion Oh, so what do you want to do now? Anything in the world except an abortion Okay, now just calm down and go home... I cannot go home Hey! Are you kidding me? Just calm down and get yourself home, whatever it is... I said I cannot go home! Bro, Just chill! Sleep over it and we'll decide in the morning. I've ordered food for you both, do you have cash? Yes Okay then, I'll see you both in the morning. Bye Thanks Anna! Hey, Chill! Chill man! Chill man! Moron keeps sulking. Hey, Open the door! Sindhu! Hello! Where are you son? In Amith's house, Why what's wrong? Buy a packet of curd on the way home. Ma, I'll come only in the morning, I have work to do. Just eat and sleep. I'm asking for curd to eat, don't you know he won't eat without curd. Yeah right, as if he can't sleep one day without curd! Anyway, don't get drunk with your friends. As if... Hang up ma Sir I'm not here as a politician, I am here as a father to a girl child. Won't I empathise with this man's pain? In a single evening, that guy has kidnapped his daughter. Serve the side dish. Enough. Yes, continue Actually this girl is not at all interested in him. He has coerced her sir. We will file a complaint in that guy's name. Hope you take care of the rest. This girl won't even move a finger without her dad's approval. Such a precious daughter Can't you see I am working hard for this case Ahem, I can see sir. We cannot just do what you tell us. Look at the girl, she hasn't uttered a word since she got here. Ask her to say something Dear tell him Weren't you forced to go with him dear? We will handle all this, just say it! Dear listen to your uncle, tell us. Say yes. Sir, I am pregnant! Oh my! What is this? What's wrong? What's happening? Such a precious daughter! Uncle!! [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Excuse me, Mr. Manikandan Looks like they'll file an FIR against me too Hey! What have you done? Oh she said it Yeah Is she even a woman? Look at what she's done! I dreamed of a grand wedding for her She is no longer my daughter, she doesn't deserve to be. The way he screams he is going get a heart attack. Did he go yet? The way he screams he'll be gone soon. Hey do something Yeah yeah dad is going to come do something alright Do you have any idea of the trouble you caused? He's coming You shut up, I'll talk to him Yeah as if He's gonna get you beaten up too Dad, he went long back, why were you inside for so long? He's planning the wedding procession for the couple that's why Hey! Do you have any brains? Didn't you see his face? He lost his dignity As the father of the boy, even I feel like jumping off a cliff. How do you think he feels? Anticipating all this, I brought him up with a lot of restrictions. Did he ever listen to me? In the end, my worst fears have come true. Dad, let's bring him home and handle this. Why? So that even more people can get to know And destroy all my self respect? Correct uncle! Yeah, He will have a few useless friends Who will stand by his side now, right? That's true uncle! I knew it! Didn't I say it long back, That he is roaming around with some girl. We should get to the bottom of it. His mother supported him saying they were deeply in love. Never knew that the love was so deep. I'll go deal with her next. Dad But there's something I don't get, Even after all that has happened. That girl inside has complete trust in him. He has never been an obedient child, But may he listen to this one thing I have to say. The girl inside who is trusting him, ask him not to betray her & never break her trust. Dad, dad! Okay, you guys just crash in the villa for today, We'll see later. No need bro, Don't want to trouble you. I'll take care bro. So it wasn't troublesome to bring me to the police station? Sorry bro Why do you talk this way It's supposed to be for my mom and dad when they visit. But they are not coming any time soon. The villa is empty. That's not it bro, It doesn't feel right. What? Nothing! Just checking if you are such a gentleman, but it doesn't look like it. Bro get me a job somehow in Suresh uncle's warehouse. Don't be stupid Bro please It's not such a big deal. Bro please understand Okay let's see Thanks bro Cow is still stealing my snacks Why are you so angry with me babe? Why did you mention abortion? I said it in some anger in the moment I said it my mistake Why would you shut me out for so long? The first time in my life, I am terrified! In a week's time we have our finals, we have to write. I still don't understand what happened or what's happening. I've asked for a job with Amith's uncle, I can earn about 10k. Somehow if we can save up for a bike, I can do some food delivery...

No I don't understand You do know where we are right? Do you even realise what we are going through? At this point how can you think of doing this? We don't need to go at all, don't piss me off Hey, what's with you Nothing I'm asking you You're acting like a stubborn child Sindhu Already I'm stressed with all the expenses with no idea how to manage Now you want to do this and that for your friends Oh God please!

Here you go Drop me on the way Your BP is still high, Hemoglobin levels are extremely low. You've lost a lot of weight. Do you realise how extremely weak you are?

Shut up! Was I the one who asked to keep the baby? I should have abandoned you just like other deadbeats do. Life itself has changed. She wants me to change. You're acting as if I cheated you or forced you to endure this alone. I also suffering with you. It's all your fault. If you'd just managed a little bit and stayed at Amith's house, This wouldn't have happened. It's all your fault. I have to take the harassment of all these people And work at a job that I hate. I told you long back! If only you had listened to me and aborted this rubbish, We won't be in all this trouble. Why are you speaking like this? Don't I adjust and stay with you. You don't have to adjust for anything, if you don't like it, just walk away. Where can I go? Do you want me to die. Say it... I'll die... Alright, die! Instead of tormenting me like this, Better to kill me with one blow and then you can die. Women are all the same bro, Don't feel bad, we need to adjust. Shut up and watch the road. Okay! You're getting a call. Where was the phone? Charging. Put it back. Hey, it's your wife. Are you even human? Oh God! Look at the state of my girl... Be careful... Please... Where the hell were you? Switch on your phone... Go inside... Where's Sindhu? We got a call from the hospital When we got here, only the baby was here. I asked the reception, they say everyone left. I tried calling Sindhu, her phone is switched off. Where's Sindhu Hey! She left Sindhu is not at her house. Looks like they moved out, the watchman was right. What do you want to do?

Okay you go to school now, Once you come back home in the evening, We can discuss this. Even after the discount, it's 999. My budget is only 400. Okay buy a Ludo board. Ludo board? You can't get all that here. You don't talk like the shop owner. Ask around they'll definitely have it. Okay shop keeper. Hi How are you I'm supposed to ask you that. All that is okay, But you should go home and talk it out to your family. Yeah yeah... Everyone's fine right? What are you up to now? Are you working? Yes, (ELSAT) BPO. Trying for a better job. Your child is a boy right? Yeah... Aditya If you don't mind, There's an opening at my office. Would you like a referral? God never appears directly, it's through you right? Do you want a job or not? Of course I do... Please refer me, it'll be a blessing. On one condition, call me akka. How many chances do you need? You keep giving excuses. Look here... this is how you should do it, I have to teach everyone everything I believe you've been given enough time... I need one person, just one person to tell me what the problem is... You, what do you think is the problem? Why is the performance bad? Yes you! Hope you have something to say... Excuse me, how long have you worked here? About 3 years. In these three years, has anyone taught you how to vaccum? No Has anyone demonstrated it for you? At least did they provide any feedback, positive or constructive? No Nothing. I think this is the problem mam. If you ask exactly what you need, I think you'll get it. If you teach them, it might get done faster. If someone does a good job and they are given positive feedback. It's very encouraging. They feel motivated to do better. It's just a communication gap. Once that's sorted. Everything can be resolved. Bullshit! Utter nonsense. Well at least you tried. What's your name Manikandan. Which process do you belong to? Mam he doesn't even belong to our company. What... Who are you? I came here for an interview. I'm Sanjana's brother. Whoa, Sanjana's brother... Oh so my brother in law. Hey... What is this... Looks like a senior position. I didn't even apply for it. So what? You deserve it my friend. You have a positive attitude and I believe it's a good fit. All the best. We'll meet the next time you're here. I hope you don't disappoint me. I think all the gods work in this office. Thank you so much, I'll make an offering on your behalf too. All other details will be mailed to you. Let this week pass, plan to join next Monday. Sure mam. Thank you. What is this. Such an expensive treat. Better job, better treat. You haven't informed him? I thought the HR would have let him know. Hi Manikandan. Hi sir. Please sit. Can I get you a coffee or tea? No sir. I'm good. Actually we've offered this role to someone else. Sorry we didn't inform you. I really thought they would have let you know. Sir, I have the appointment letter in my hand. How can that be? It might be a mistake, maybe a typing error. Can you please recheck for my sake? Actually this job is through my sister Sanjana's referral. You can speak to her too. She's the one who referred someone for the role. It's because of her that someone else has been given this position. I don't understand Please don't get offended. But I think she didn't like that you were going to earn more than her. Sorry for wasting your time. Hey, Come sit... I was a little busy... Sorry... The position went to someone else, Because of HR recommendation. I'm sorry. Did I ask you for a job? You all want us to be successful because of you, But not more successful than you. Hey... Please don't say that... Hey... What happened to you? Sanjay shoved me. Why did he do that? He always bullies me Why didn't you tell me If I tell you, he'll hit me more. Show me who this Sanjay is... There he is, the one who's hiding. Why are you hiding? If your grandson lays a finger on my son again, I'll bury you. Grandson? What the hell are you saying? Are you blind? Look at his face, does he look like a grandson to me? Yes, of course. What nonsense... Get lost... Hey, I'll never forget this, You insulted me in front of my son. I'll not spare you... Come... Don't tell your mother any of this... Sir please sir... I need to go sir... You please tell him sir... I was just making reels with this flower. He just brought me here. Shut up and sit down! In front of my son who was born after trying to conceive for 13 years, This bloody idiot called my own son, my grandson & caused me emotional damage. Hence, I would like to request the most grievous punishment under every possible law in our country. Please lock him up for at least 6 months to shut him up completely. I am unable to overcome this trauma. Dad, I feel hungry. When will we go home? Ah, Amith uncle will come pick you up now. You go have your dinner and go to bed. Dad will come home soon. I'll be with you dad. You're not supposed to be here son If you stay here, that uncle will scold you. You go with Amith uncle I'll be there before you know it We'll go together dad. Take this With this complaint… I'll ask the uncle myself... Sir, Can I please stay here with my dad? Son, you're not allowed here Please Won't you listen to me? I promise I will behave No son... Uncle please, I wanna stay with dad Sir I forgot my signature Give it to me for a moment You want to stay here? Okay, come let's go home Come, Don't tell your mother any of this Listen, most of the problems in this world are because of fathers. Why do you get so aggressive So what, if you lose this job? It's not like you lost your life? Just move on to the next one You aggression got displaced and now landed on me. I so happen to be tender hearted and am able to take it. What if I was a ruffian? What would have happened? With one strike I would have landed in a jail cell. Then my son will be abandoned. Why risk it all? See, you take this card, Venugopal IT man. Go meet him tomorrow, I'll let him know. Sir, just now I've been completely screwed over. I need a break before it happens again. Oh God! Don't mess with my head. This is not the same, that's a relative. I'm a friend. Sometimes friends are closer than a brother… or something like that Hey, where's my order? Nothing better be missing on my plate… Hi, I'm here to meet Mr.Venugopal He is here. Please head to the 7th floor. Hmm He has never vouched for someone so much. They will take you to the manager, they'll tell you what to do. Please wait in here, they'll join you. I cannot work there What? So you came here all the way just to tell me that you quit? You could have finished this in one phone call. This is exactly why I never recommend anyone for a job Sir, all these years when I pictured the moment when I see her again I imagined that I'll give her a tight slap Today, she's right there, next to me And I can't even look at her I'm unable to even face her Sir I appreciate what you did for me, I swear I'll never forget it. But I'll consider this the last favor from you. Please forgive me, but I can never work there. Look at you, you're shivering! You look like you saw a ghost. Sir I cannot handle 8hrs each day in that place. Just the way she looked at me was too much After struggling for 4 years, I've just started to feel like myself again In just one glace, I went back to where I started. As far as I am concerned The issue is with you, not her. She's clearly forgotten everything, moved on And living life to the fullest Look at you like a weenie So pathetic! I actually feel sorry for you How long can you run away? Face your fears man! See, My mother used to say, The finger can only be bent this way, if you stretch it on the other side, You'll end up with a broken finger. This is the fact of life At least for 30 days try to stick it out Post which you can change the team I'm basically a scholar in this This groundbreaking Gokul has this philosophy for you. Trust me Everyone take an hour break for lunch You better be back in one hour. Don't over think this Just join the job for now We'll handle it Machan, do it for Adithya's sake He's becoming big, not a kid anymore He knows and understands things now In this ego battle, don't let your son lose When are you getting a haircut? Why does it matter you inconsiderate fool Is someone already in dreamland? Adi... Do you know what a mother is? You do? Yeah Then how come you never asked me about it?

If you have 4 hours for a task, Doesn't mean you should do it in the 4th hour. It should be done ahead of time. You want to issue a memo? Go ahead Mani? You won't issue memos for all this right? Why do you ask? Actually, I have planned an emergency tomorrow. I need 3 hours permission Can you check to see if your ID number is correct? I'll get back to work. I'll complete 4 hours work in just 1hour. We'll eat and continue? Pappad? No thanks Who's that? That's the groom chosen for her by the family. Sir I can understand why you're so shocked. Are you wondering how I'm so calm about it? See this groom is chosen by her family. Sindhu isn't interested in him even one bit. How do you know that? Once this fool came to office, to me to know more about her He drops in once in awhile. And we share notes See the irony, He comes to me for advice on how to court her But he doesn't realize that I'm just a spectator He just pops up suddenly and asks Sindhu to consider him. But somehow I get the feeling that Sindhu is already smitten with someone else. Who? Someone But I feel sorry for Sindhu On one hand this fool On the other hand, her supervisor What about her supervisor? He has his eye on her He's a disgusting pervert He keeps torturing her You'll get to know He's in Delhi, He'll be back soon His face is made to be punched He pissed me off so badly that I should have broken his face Why didn't you? Didn't I tell you I'm just a spectator, here to see Sindhu Why lose that privilege? Why don't you send a written complaint? Who will do it? We'll end up being blacklisted It's unnecessary trouble Better to leave it One day he'll get what he deserves You calm down, I'll handle it Not bad, you know so much. What? All information regarding Sindhu is always at my fingertips So you know everything about her? Agent Sara van an Only if you move aside can someone get in the way The way things are moving You'll be announcing their wedding banns Today, I saw a forward message that applies to you It's supposed to be for you See, it says True love bears a million wounds and yet does not break Nor does it hate. You forward it to me, I'll put it up as a status. You stay in touch on WhatsApp so that... The bike is mine sir The bike may belong to you but this parking lot is mine. You can't just leave it here to go do your business You need to pay a fine of 1000rs Unless you give it, I'll stay put I promised my girl I'll take her on a date. She'll be waiting. Why didn't you say that first? Your girl will be waiting and I can't bear that thought Look at him, going full swing You should be like that Whatever you lose in life, You may never get back You have a chance to get back a lost life Don't let it slip Don't you know the difference between KBI and TBI? What kind of education did you get? If it's your money, you'll know the worth. You know how to post on Instagram like clockwork You know how to colour co-ordinate your outfits? All this comes naturally to you? But work? Just by changing pictures online, doesn't mean the job gets done You need to focus on your work What did you do? She made an error while crediting the payment How much longer? 6 Hours We can deal with it. I'll take responsibility! Machan why do you cry so much for this Don't you know she's like that She won't take it to heart You shut up She doesn't even follow me on Instagram So you're not upset about the scolding Hey! Machan... Go get tea! Hello bro. Oh new girlfriend? You just have to log in and escalate a SWIFT mail I have a contact in the bank so don't worry about it. Once you send the email, He'll process it and reverse the payment It should be done in 3 hours I usually charge 15k for this Since you are in Mani's team, 13k will do. Better if it's in cash Can I Gpay 6k? Okay sure At least let me in on the joke next time Dude, how come you're online during working hours? Payment is reversed, alright? Happy? Do you want to check once It's all accurate You were about to say something Thanks, On Sindhu's behalf Turn around. Come on turn around. Yes! She turned Mani, I think she's looking at me Can you check? Is she looking? Yes she is Yess O Beautiful one, The trapped fish's struggle is the same as my battle in love. The fish fights to take a breath and I fight to live in your love. In your love... Huh? Is it nice? Yes Amazing Shall I confess to her then? Yes definitely, Say it just like you told me. Tell me. Joshua is threatening to commit suicide here in the bathroom, Is it? Come right away Oh super, I'll be there Sir, come let's go to the restroom I don't need to, you go ahead Sir Joshua is attempting suicide It will be fun, let's go watch You psycho The one is suicidal is mad, why am I mad? I swear I'll kill myself. Make the call right now. Ask that groom to go back home If I say that my dad will kill himself I don't care if you don't love me You cannot love someone else You definitely cannot marry someone else You and I can stay single for the rest of our lives Joshua drop the knife Joshua please What happened? Joshua has been love with Deepika even without her knowledge Step back! Once he knew some prospective groom is visiting her today He's been threatening to kill himself Just listen to me you fool I had a doubt if people who threaten to do it will actually do it I think I'll get some clarity today Sir sir sir, don't come near me I will kill myself, Sir... Sir, go outside I'll do it Yeah you can go ahead, I came to pee Machan, there's an opening here. You were enquiring about a job right Send me your resume, might get a spot selection You know right? You won't die instantly by slitting your throat It's a slow death Obviously all the guys outside will try to play the hero Using you to get with other girls If you hit the right vein it's okay If you miss, you'll probably get paralyzed for life Then you can't pee standing up I feel sorry just thinking of how this is probably the last time you'll be in a restroom I know you decided to die But before you do Think if the reason is really worth it Sir, If I don't do it now, I'll become the laughing stock What do I do now? You were acting so long, keep up the performance for a bit more Hey come here come on Hold him. Grab it. Take it away. Take him out. Hello! No opening now, I'll call you if someone dies Come on Yo Daddy! Tell me Sadhana is asking you out for dinner Enjoy! You completed your homework? Nope Who's gonna complete it? Do it Naughty! But... I'm unsure... unsure how to tell you Keep thinking about it I'll finish up with a phone call and get back You don't have to pay Dinner is on me Come on, you've got this! Did you have something to tell me? We'll leave then? Wipe your tears man I had a sense, Why does she look at me only when I'm with him. He had this weird look on his face, looked me in the eye and said “So you know everything about her?” He gave me so many hints I even pointed my fingers at his face Do you have any right to laugh at me? Rightfully we should hold a funeral service for you today As if you are qualified You also got snubbed Shut up You know how he handled the whole thing. He's super sweet, he made sure I didn't get hurt I feel bad for him, He's been through a lot We should do something about it We can mind our own business They both deserve to be together This is new What's new? Women usually plot to separate a couple You plan to bring them together Hey, I'm serious We should do something Someone come up with a plan Idea? Why is everyone staring at me You're the one who's using a straw for a beer You can think of something new Oh my Gosh! You guys are asking me to set my love up with someone else. Not someone else! With her soul mate! If you have genuine love, make a good plan. Hitting a man where it hurt! You questioned my love? Wait and watch This Saturday, there's a team outing. What! When was this announced? Not yet, it's going to be announced. We need to book a beach side resort And somehow make Mani and Sindhu join If it's just us, they'll know something is up So let's invite the other teams too You create a new WhatsApp group And post about the team outing on Saturday Hey, Sara van a there isn't a single reply in the group It's as silent as a grave Post that there's free lunch See how they'll pile in now Wow! The entire company is in bro How did you do it? It's not a big deal, now the important part of the plan. Somehow we need to get them both in the same room And lock them up inside. By the time they come out, They'll be professing their love for each other This is the worst plan I've heard, dipshit Yeah right, as if you could come up with anything better. Just for this, you're in charge of bringing Sindhu, Go beg! Hey, I'll take care of it You go get ready It's alright I got it You don't need to do all this As long as you study well, I'm happy What do you want to do when you grow up Work Work is right, What kind of work?

Son please speak to me I've been pleading for so long I admit I was wrong But please don't stop talking to me I'm your mother right Please speak to me I can forgive even your husband But never you, you old lady Please left your leg Higher Your brother is the kind of person who turns his underwear Inside out and reuses it for 4 days. Look at the way he's bringing up his son I was at the doorstep like a dog, calling out for you You didn't even bother Okay leave that, did you try reaching me even once in all these 4 years?
