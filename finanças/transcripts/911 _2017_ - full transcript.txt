♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Chantelle ♪ - Oh, so pretty. - That's right. ♪ Happy birthday to you... Let's go up a bit. ♪ Youuuuu! Tickle Monster! Ah, it's your birthday, Chantelle. Dada love you so much, so much. You look so cute. Happy birthday, love. Oh, man. All right, I gotta go, I gotta go. It's so hard. Let me get out of here. Go, all right, bye-bye-bye. Okay, bye. Well, it's somebody's birthday! Mmmm! Hmm. Oh! Today... today Mommy gets her life back. Yes, wish me luck. Mwah! Ahh! Don't miss me too much. Yo, three's up! There you go. - Hey, Nicki. - Hey! Hey! So, did you open the envelope? Hmm, we decided that we're gonna be surprised. Well, you know, in the old days, you didn't have a choice, you had to wait. It was a very long time ago, but... What? I can't make it to the baby shower. So I thought I would bring this to you. Well, thank you. Karen, you got her coffee? - Sure do. - Thank you. - Have a really good time. - Thank you, I wish you could be there. - Me too, me too. - There you go, miss. Thank you, darling. All right, kids, bye. Jeffrey, I'm sure you're aware, there's no smoking in here. I used to have three floors in this building. You got an ashtray? You see? I can be reasonable. Good. Well, are we or are we not going to execute this divorce agreement today? Can I-- can I please just have a moment with my wife? Seriously? So this is what you brought us in here for, eight o'clock this morning, go through this again? Come on, Lloyd. We're talking about 17 years. What's one more day? Give us a moment. It's okay. All right, it's your call. Mr. Cage, I highly advise you to, please, not blindside us with something we can't fix later. Come on, you heard the man. Give them the time. - We'll be outside. - Thank you. Really, Jeffrey? You're gonna do this in the ninth hour? It's the eleventh. What? You're supposed to say the eleventh hour, not the ninth. Are you kidding me? Is this some big joke to you? Come on, you used to love my sense of humor. Yeah, you used to be funny. Don't... don't make me do the weekend dad thing, please, Eve. My God, Jeffrey, you hardly spend time with J.J. as it is. You were away for business when he was born. You were in Toronto when he took his first steps, in Hong Kong when he said his first words, in San Francisco for his first day of school. Shall I continue? All right, so then sign the damn papers and let's get on with this. Why do you think I work all the time? I do it for him, I do it for us. Jeffrey, there is no more "us." Then why are you still wearing your ring? Bad habit. Hey, Eddie, you there? Copy. It's Stu. Pick up. No, man, this is Eddie's sister, Edwina. How are you? Sammy up on the 35th is having trouble with his lock again. Can you see what's going on? Copy? He's having trouble with the lock, or did he forget his damn keys again? Man, don't bust my balls. Bring your tools just in case. Oh, and the toilet on 43rd is having issues. Come on, buddy, are you kidding me? I just unclogged that yesterday. Well, you're gonna have to unclog it again. Copy? You know, I promise you, I'm gonna take a picture of whatever I find, I'm gonna send it to your ass. Get back to me when your shit don't stink, amigo. Yeah, right, when my shit don't stink, when my shit don't stink. One cup of coffee. One cup of coffee. Katie back now, thank you so much. Good morning, everybody. For the second time in two weeks, the U.S. has lost an unmanned supply plane over Iraq. Whoo! Well... You know how sometimes you just don't want to get out of bed? - Yep. - That was me today. - Whoo! Sorry. - You're late. I know I'm late. Everything okay? Yep. - I don't have to think about anything? - No. - All right. Good, good, good. Nice. Alright. I see you. What are your guys now? Oh, I think my Mets are 71 and 73. We're almost playing .500 baseball. Hmm. My Yanks are 85 and 57. When you gonna come over to the pinstripes? When you pay me my hundred dollars, honey. Ooh, okay, that'll be tomorrow. - Uh-huh. - Right after I hit the trifecta in the sixth. Okay, Scarlett. Actually, you sounded more like Annie. ♪ Tomorrow, tomorrow, I'll pay you tomorrow ♪ - I've heard of her. - Mm-hmm. Mm. Ha ha ha! Look. It's Captain Crapper. Heh heh heh! You're lucky I'm a little out of shape, don't kick your ass, Charlie. - Your body ain't seen a push-up in 20 years. - Try 25, Frankie. Oh, my mistake. Hey, we still on for Thursday? You gotta ask? Have I ever missed poker night? Poker? What about pizza night? I'm at pizza night, you know that. Are you kidding me? You know I'll show up to that anytime. - Frankie. - Yeah. You wanna hold this for a second? I gotta tie my shoe. Matter of fact, I gotta go. We hung out together on Sunday night at a fashion show, and she'll be joining us this morning to tell us about a personal style show that she is hosting and producing. It is called "Tracey Ullman's Visible Panty Lines." ♪ Bah-da-bah-da-bah... Katie, we're also going to have more of our week-long special series on living longer, living better after the age of 50. This morning we'll focus on the role your mood... Excuse me. - Sorry, sir. - You're fine. Oh, shit, this one's going up. You really don't have to walk me to my car. I am perfectly capable of getting there myself. It's something a good husband does. Oh, and that's supposed to be you all of a sudden? Hey. Uh... um... okay, what time-- what time is your mom coming through? Uh, I'll be there like 15 minutes, something like 15 minutes after she gets there, yeah, I'll be there. Hello? Hello? Hello, hello, hello? Damn. Not a cloud in the sky. Have a good day, everyone. Wait. Is this one going down? At some point. I'll take the next one. Perfect. Shit! What the fuck was that? What the hell was that? Oh, man. Where are my elevators? What the hell? Jeffrey, what's going on? I don't have a clue. Maybe one of the cables snapped. No, no, no, I heard something. Sounded like an explosion. Let me try the intercom. Metzie? Hello? Metzie, come on, girlfriend, hello? Something's going on. ...check the circuit breakers right now. Is there an outage? It's crazy. Is anybody there? Can anybody hear me? Damn. What's going on? - Metzie, you feel that? - Yeah, what was it? They say a small-engine plane hit the building. - Come on. - The fire department's trying to figure it out. Look, half my elevators are not working. Nothing on the console is working at all. Try rebooting the communication link. - I did that. - Well, try it again. - Well, how many times should I do it? - I'm telling you, look at the board! - Again. - They'll come up. - Look at the board! Where are you going? I'm gonna go see what's going on. Son of a... Metzie! Metzie, come on, baby girl! Who is Metzie? Metzie's the elevator dispatcher. She's usually "Johnny on the Spot" All the circuits are busy. - I can't get no reception either. Intercom is down. All the cell towers are jammed. But why do so many people need to make calls at the same time? If it is a broken cable, can we fall? That only happened once, in 1945. The Empire State Building got hit by a B-25 bomber and the elevator fell roughly 80 stories. But.. The lady survived. Survived? Eighty-story fall? That's bullshit. Were you a witness? In '45? Sure, I look great for my age, don't you think? Um,, how did she make it? Apparently she laid on the floor, on her back, and didn't break a single bone. It was a miracle. Un milagro. Well, perhaps. I think of it more as random. Besides, all these modern elevators have brakes in case something like that happens. - How do we know this one-- - Because they all do. He reads a lot. How much? Six newspapers a day, even on Sundays. The crosswords. I gather you guys know each other? Well, I've got a piece of paper at home - that says we're married. - Oh, really? - She's got one in her purse... - You're gonna do this-- See, this is exactly what the shrink talks about... trying to say that we're not. When you're oversharing with strangers. Don't have to do that. That's so sad. You two seem like a good match. - We are. - We're not. So, uh, Eddie... You look like someone who knows his way around this building. - Yeah, a bit. - How long you been working here? I've been working here 20 years. I'm a custodial engineer. - Hmm. A janitor? - Excuse me. Custodial engineer, okay, buddy? Okay, okay, so how much do you actually know about the elevators in this building? I know they go up and I know they go down, that's about it. All right, anybody want to give me a hand, try to pry the doors open? I'll help you out, but I don't know why. Careful. Yeah, it feels like it's stuck on something. It's probably one of the ones that have a lock on it. What? What? What does that mean? Some of the elevators, they have locks that prevent the doors from opening. A lock engages when the elevator's disabled or in between landings. Why do they want us to be stuck in here? It's an insurance issue. Part of the training you get when you work here. We're not supposed to encourage people to climb out of these things. The protocol is, you wait for help. That's the insurance part. That way nobody's gonna fall down the shaft. Wait, so-- so... so we can't unlock it, we're stuck in here? Yeah, I mean, I don't think so, I mean, I don't know. I don't see how we could open this from the inside anyway. I mean, that's the whole idea, right? Hey, everyone... I'm freaking out. I don't do well in small places. - None of us do. - Look at me, just breathe. You've gotta breathe. Look at me, calm down. What do you say, Eddie, should we give it a shot? Ready? Yeah. You just said, the reason why this thing is locked, so... can we just, like, wait for the people to come and get us out of here? I mean, I know it's terrible, but we've only been in here for like a few minutes. Let me see if I've got this straight. The dude that rides a bicycle all over Manhattan is the dude that's now making safety an issue? Whatever, dude. I'm the dude with a reason for what I'm saying. Guys, could we please not do the "dude" thing? Listen, we've gotta stay calm, okay? Someone will come. I think... I'm sorry, what is your name? Michael. - Michael, hi, I'm Eve. - Hello. This is Jeffrey. You are...? - Tina. - Okay. You know I'm Eddie. Yes. We just have to keep calm, you guys. Look, guys, I think we're just gonna have to wait this out. That's what we'll have to do. Because of insurance? - Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - Exac-- - Thanks. Okay, okay. So, what floor are we on, exactly? Uh, let's see. I got on the 35th floor, went up a little bit. I wanna say we're somewhere between the 38th, 37th floor. That's it. Anybody want one? Helps you relax. No, I'm good. As Matt just mentioned, we have a breaking news story Apparently a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center here in New York City. Nora, come here. I need you to take all of this, take it right into there. We need a supervisor here. Is there a supervisor? Guys, we've got 32 elevators off the grid. All the upper floors are gone. No security cameras anywhere. I did manage to find two folks in shaft 6 on floors 8 and 13. All right, we've got an inferno on the North Tower on 90 and above. Can any of my guys take the elevators? You cannot take the elevators. They are down. Nothing is working. - Ninety floors of stairs? - Ninety floors. - There's gotta be a better way. - I'm sorry, guys, I don't have it for you. You just gotta do what you can do. Alright, we'll make do. Tell the captain we're going 90, we're taking the stairs. Go, fellas! We're taking the stairs! ...behind me, and it is unbelievable. When the fire first... - Fuck! - What the fuck? Hey! You gotta tell us what's going on in here, Eddie. - I'm trying. - Yo. What is going on in here, man? Jeffrey, what's going on? - We're okay. We're okay. Do you hear that? Shit. That was very interesting. I think I'll take you up on taking one of those. About the last few times you took prescription meds. - What happened? - I'm allergic to them. I break out in airbags, okay? Totally different situation. - Okay. Were you here in '93? My friend Paulie got hurt pretty bad. Man, I started riding in '93. That was... just crazy. Intercom's dead. Phone lines are down. The noises, the shockwave. I thought about that. - Really? - What? I didn't wanna say anything about it. Wait, what happened in '93? A group of Jihadists drove a van into the basement of the North Tower, about a thousand pounds of explosives on board. Yeah, six people died, hundreds got hurt. My friend Paulie lost his leg. The bad guys thought if they detonated the bomb that the North Tower would topple into the South, bringing them both down. Look, I understand how we're all feeling. I understand the protocol. But my gut is telling me... We have to get out of here. We have to get out of here now. Fuck this shit. Wanna give me a hand, please? Try that shit one more time. Come on, one, two... - Come on. Come on, come on! - Christ. - Two, three! - Pull! Harder. Oh, it's not working. Fuck! Please, can... anybody... hear me? Hello? Metzie, it's Eddie! - It's Eddie! - Eddie! Where the hell are you? Man, I am so happy to hear your voice right now, listen. Metzie, we're on the 38th, 37th floor somewhere, in the North Tower. What the fuck is going on out there?! Baby, you're not gonna believe this. Some fool hit the tower with like a little propeller plane or something. Get the fuck out, are you kidding me? No, I'm telling you the truth. Somebody hit the damn thing with a little plane! No shit. Is there a lot of damage? I don't know, baby, I don't know. It's some sort of... I don't know. It hit the 90th floor. All the elevators seem to be down. I'm watching a live feed outside the building, and I can tell you, it doesn't look good. Listen, there's five of us in here, including me. We're all good right now. Well, do you have any water? You have stuff to drink? - Uh... - I got this. Yeah, we got some water. And a granola bar. I'm just saying, you know, it might take a little while to get to you. - Excuse me, let me talk to her. - Yeah, go. Metzie? Yeah, hi, this is Jeffrey Cage. Oh, Jeff... Well, I'd be a lot better if we had a sense of timing on when to expect some help. I think the first order of business is going to be getting the flames contained. I think once they do that, they can do everything else, but they have to go up to ninety-something to put the flames out, so, sir, you're just gonna have to sit tight. - What? - So are you saying that not one single elevator is operational at this point? No, sir, what I'm saying is not one single elevator is operational yet. That's what I'm saying. Yet. I don't understand. What does that mean? Metzie, we're gonna hang here tight, all right? Just do me a favor, please, just get somebody up here as soon as you can, okay? I will, baby. And, Eddie? Yeah? Don't forget you owe me money, okay? Yeah, okay. All right. So, guys, this is great. Right? I mean, we're getting out of here. - She's sending help. It's great. - Yeah. Yeah, but didn't she say they need to contain the fires first? Man, it's gonna take the firefighters all day to go up and down the stairs, all day. And we're talking about what, a minute a floor? We're looking at an hour and a half, maybe two, just for them to make it to the flames. You know, I'm not worried about it. We've got billionaire Jeffrey Cage in the elevator. They're gonna be sprinting up the stairs just to get him out. You mean get us out. Well, I'm-- I'm just saying, you know, membership in your club has its privileges. Whatever it takes, right? Right. - Yeah, man. - Right. You know, I remember seeing you around. You probably don't remember me, but I remember you. The King of Wall Street, man. You were the shit, Mr. Cage. Yeah, man. Thank you. Making money hand over first. Come on. Yeah, man, pretty cool. I'm sorry we had to meet this way. Me too. - I'm just gonna chill out over here if you need anything. Okay. Thank you. How in the hell does that happen? How do you accidentally crash a plane into one of the largest buildings in New York City? Excuse me. Jeffrey. Can we just do this? I need you to sign this. I just do. Really? In here? Right now? Why not? We're not going anywhere. You can't run away. What difference does it make? All these people know our business, anyway. You mean just like all your friends do? I mean, Christ, even Nancy knew you were filing before I did. A woman is gonna talk to her friends first before she makes any big life decisions. - Excuse me? - Sorry. Come on. The writing was on the wall for years. You just never slowed down long enough to read it. Okay, okay, all right, fine. Okay, okay, so... Tell me, what's it say? Okay, it says, I'm tired of fighting with you. I'm tired of feeling lonely all the time. I'm tired of looking into our son's sad little face full of disappointment because his father is not there again, and I have to explain to him why not, why isn't he sharing his life with him, why isn't he here. I can't do it. I really can't do it. You've got to do this for us, please. I-I promise you, all of that is going to change. Yeah. I've heard this before. And I believed it the first hundred times. I'm sorry, I just... I don't have any belief left in me anymore. You guys, you guys are so lucky. You get to fight in one language. At home, my wifey, she comes at me in Spanish and in English. Let me tell you something, don't ever get a Puerto Rican girl mad at you. Nah. She starts with all that Spanglish stuff, untranslatable, trust me, okay? I'm not kidding on that. What do you fight about? Oh, what don't we fight about? Kids, money, work. My girlfriend from the ninth grade. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I don't love her. I mean, shit, I've been with her for, what, 23 years... Yeah, 23 years. I mean, that alone reserves her a space in heaven. You know, these are my kids right here. Everybody, that's Christian. MJ, my little princess right there. She's nine. Ooh, what I wouldn't do for them. Mr. Cage, you got any kids? J.J. He's eight. What about you, mister man? You got any kids? Yep. Boys? Girls? Girl. Actually, today is her birthday and we had a party planned out for her and everything, but as you can see, I'm stuck in a goddamn elevator with y'all, so... What's her name? Chantelle. Oh, that's a beautiful name. Well... maybe they'll get us out of here and you'll still make it in time. Please, please, please, just stop. I get it. I don't mean to disrespect you, no disrespect, but it's okay. I know something about missing birthdays, so I'm okay. ...like confetti. Um, the area is swarmed with - emergency vehicles and sirens. - Have you-- Obviously, we're very sensitive to this in this neighborhood. Because of the incident that occurred in the early 1990s, have you seen any evidence, Ellie, yet of people being taken out of the building? You say that emergency vehicles are there, understandably so, but of course a major concern is human loss. I mean, do you know if there were many people in the building? Oh, another one just hit! Something else just hit! What the fuck?! Metzie! Metzie, what the hell is that? Metzie! There it is right there. Again, I'm looking from south to north, and it went into the one on the right. Eddie, stand by. That appears to be at least a 727. It was at least a 727. It was a jet. I couldn't believe my eyes, watching it right above me. And now you have to move from talk about a possible accident to talk about something deliberate that has happened here. We're going to immediately check with air-traffic control in the area to find out if they had contact with either of these planes before the accident. But what we've just seen is about the most shocking videotape I've ever seen. Eddie. Yeah. Listen, baby, I... I need you... to try to get the hell out of that elevator. What happened to the help you said was coming? I think their hands are full. What do you mean their hands are full? Baby, I think we're under attack. - What? - Under attack? '93, guys. Listen, have you-- have you tried opening the doors? Yeah. I think... I think we got... We got one of the new ones with a lock. Oh, what about the hatch? There's a hatch on the roof. There's an escape hatch on the roof. Did you try that? No hatch. I mean... There is. It's there, it's behind the roof's paneling. You just... It's probably locked, All right, wait, wait, how... How am I supposed to get, how? Listen to me. I'm telling you, you need to get out of the elevator. You understand me? Get out of the elevator. Metzie. Metzie, when you say "under attack," what the hell does that actually mean? The explosion you felt was from the South Tower, was from another plane. And not by accident, man. On purpose. Holy shit. - Okay, okay, um... - Holy shit. Call Frankie on his cell phone! I've been calling him, I've been calling him. He was here for a few minutes and then he went outside to see what was going on, and I ain't seen him since, Who is Frankie? - Okay, Frankie, Frankie, he's the elevator supervisor. He knows his way in and out of them. He knows everything about this shit! Okay, okay, Metzie, listen, listen! We're gonna-- we're gonna try and figure this out. Okay, we're gonna try and figure this out. Just please, please, get in touch with Frankie. All right, we're gonna try and figure this out in here. Okay, I'll get back to you. - Watch your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. - There you go. - Got it. Push it, push it. - Okay, all right. - Yes! Okay, all right. Okay, right there. I think I could get to that, guys. - Is that the...? Can I get a hand, please? - Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. You should take that off, bro. Take that off, come on. Here we go. - Alright, we got you here. We got you here. Okay, please? - I'll go in the front, I'll go in front. - Okay, ready? Here we go. - Yeah. - One... Wait. - Got ya, got ya... Move over a little bit. Right, and one, two... - Okay, come on! - You nearly got it! I think I can get this. Will it open? - Can you open it? - Gimme the mallet! - The what? - The mallet, the hammer! Okay, okay. - Come on, come on! - Hit it harder! Come on, you bastard! Open up, you son of a bitch! Bitch! Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. Eve, in my back pocket, there's a knife. Take it out. - I got it. - Come on, you got it? I'm opening it for you. Here, it's open. Okay, okay, all right. - Anything, Eddie? - Shit. - You feel anything? - Open up! - Did you hit anything? - Is it working? Shit. - Come on, Ed, what have you got? - Damn it! - Anything? Shit! Damn it! Okay, okay, let me down, easy. Easy. - You okay? - My knee, my knee. Wait. Wait, wait, guys. You hearing this? Oh, man. She's talking to us. She's not happy. - Who is? - The building. All right, maybe we should empty everything onto the floor. Dump our pockets, purses, everything. - Why? - I don't know why. Maybe one of us has something we can use. I've got water. I've got... Shit, I've got shit. I've got shit. It's just envelopes, nothing. I got a bunch of losing freakin' tickets. - Nail file? - How big? Small. I got some mints. Oh, man. What if we make some noise? Well, all right then. Let's make some noise. Can you hear us?! Anyone! Help! - Help! Help! - Anyone! Anybody! Help! ...through the buildings and then went into the upper floors of the World Trade Center tower. I want to just mention that when the impact hit the first tower, we hoped that people who were in the second tower... - Metzie! - Yeah, go for Metzie. You get hold of Frankie? No! Literally, all the elevator mechanics were evacuated once the second tower got hit. What about a channel? You try a channel? You think I haven't tried that? I've tried everything. Listen, there is so much chaos down here, it's not even funny. People are jumping. They're jumping off the buildings? Oh my God. - I told the firemen where you were. They know exactly where you are and so as soon as they get to you, they'll be able to take care of it. I mean, listen... Every department from all over the city is here trying to figure this out. I just need you to hang in there. Hang in there? What the fuck do you mean "hang in there"? That's all we're doing is hanging in here. Where is the help, lady?! We need help, okay? We need help! - We have to get out of here now. - Okay, guys, guys, please! Please, let's stay focused. Now, why is this... this Frankie guy and all the mechanics so goddamn important? Because they're the only ones that work these things. We need them to release the locks. Okay, okay. So, we don't need them to release the lock. We need the information inside their heads to release the lock. Frankie, Frankie, Frank, Frank... Frankie's office! Frankie's office! He's got all the manuals up there along the wall. Wait, say that again? Frankie's office, the manuals to how these things work are right there behind his desk! Oh, shit. You're in a new elevator, hang tight. They're in a new elevator, retrofit, nobody knew. Damn, I gave them bad information. Shit! What floor are we on, Mike? Not sure, I stopped counting at 72. Keep goin', guys. Just keep moving! I hope she finds those manuals, man. Think she's gonna find them? Honestly, I don't know. She's got to make it all the way down to the basement floor and then back up. It might be a while before she gets back to us. I don't wanna die today. Nobody's gonna die. Nobody's gonna die, mija, you hear me? You're gonna get through this. We're all gonna get through this. What? Which one is that? Whose phone is that? - Shit! My phone. - Come on, where is it? It's my phone! Yeah, yeah, I got it. - Fuck! Where is it? - Eve, find it! Ahh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hello! - Eve, where are you? Oh, Mom, hi! Where the hell are you? Are you in that building? Y-Yeah... just listen. We're... we're still in the North Tower. All right? And we're stuck. How is J.J. doing? He's fine. Are you together? Yes. We're technically still married. - Can you-- please-- can you have her call my wife for me? - Yes. Me too, me too? Mom, listen-- listen to me. I need you to concentrate. Get a pen and a paper. You're gonna write down some numbers. Yes, of course, of course. Of course. Let me find some paper. I'm... okay, hang on. Hang on. Okay, go. You got it? Yeah, hold on. Um, 212... 356-5567. I'm Michael. My wife's name is Holly. Okay, Michael. Yeah, uh, Eddie. And my number is 212-773-2755, and my wife's name is Gloria. Okay, I've got it. Okay. I'm okay. No one? Anything else? Mom, can you put J.J. on the phone, please? Of course, he's right here. J.J. I'm on the North Lawn at the White house... Mom? Hi, hiya, sweetheart. Mom and Dad, are you guys watching this? Dad, your old building's on fire. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, buddy, we're watching it on television. Will the firemen put the fire out? Well... yeah, of course they will. That's... that's what they do, kiddo. Listen, baby, I need you to do something for me. You have to stay inside, okay? You and Nanna need to stay home. I don't want you going anywhere, alright? We were gonna go to the park. J.J., your mother said to stay put. We're not moving until we see them right in front of us. Come home soon, okay? I love you guys. I love you more, buddy. I love you so much. Um, be good. Can you put Nanna on the phone for a second, please? Here you go. Eve? Mom, will you please put on one of his shows? I don't want him watching this shit on TV, do you understand? And, um... Listen, you have to make sure you give him his medication, he needs it. Eve? Hello? Hello? Hello! Shit! The thing... It's okay. It's okay. She doesn't give him his thing! It's all right. Oh, my God. Okay. It's gonna be okay, right? Yes. Okay. I'm sorry. ...President Bush to arrive there, Bob? Well, Katie, he's coming back directly and you figure it's about a two-hour flight, so, uh, you can do the math. The reason I said that it was so surreal was that, within just about 20 minutes ago, they were still conducting tours. You had hordes of tourists and others still in the White House on tour, lining up outside to get in. There seemed to be absolutely no unusual... Yes, thank you, God. Thank you, thank you! Today, we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I have spoken to the vice-president, to the governor of New York, to the director of the FBI, and have ordered that the full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation... to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act. Terrorism against our nation will not stand. And now if you'll join me in a moment of silence. May God bless the victims, their families, and America. Thank you very much. Okay. Guys better get on it. Call your families, let 'em know you're all right. Go on now, I got it. I got this. I've just got to talk to them. Go ahead, man. So... went to my doctor this morning. He said that he was gonna need a, uh... a urine sample and blood sample and a stool sample. And I said, "You know what? Why don't you just take my underwear?" Take my underwear? No? No. Jeffrey? Really? You're gonna do that now? Mr. Cage, you have jets and stuff? No, I don't have jets and stuff. What is with you and money? I just never had money like that, that's all. Well, unless you're an airline, it's a little excessive to have more than one jet. So you have a jet? Who gets the jet? That, I get to keep. Yeah, of course you do. Can it make it all the way to Hawaii? If we left from here, we'd have to stop in Los Angeles to refuel. See, I always wanted to go to Hawaii. I promised my wife for our 10th wedding anniversary, yeah. Just that we never had that kind of cash, so... We go to Orchard Beach. Yeah. And what happened? You lose it all? I guess you could say that. How much? That depends who I'm lying to. What are we talking, tables, sports, ponies? All of them. A few tough beats, you know. Started looking around... Next thing, I'm hiding from my bookie at the racetrack. And all I'm thinking is like, "Yo, I'm gonna double my daughter's college fund with this one bet." Walk into my house with a big stack, be this hero. Yeah. I mean that's... what I'm always thinking in my mind, you know, a hero. Just that it never goes down like that. So... But you're still chasing it. Shit, isn't that-- isn't that what we're all doing? Chasing that big brass ring? Not me. Don't kid yourself, mija. That's what people in this whole city are doing all the time, okay. Oh, please. You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. I came here today to tell him it was over. Who? Your boyfriend? If you want to call him that. He's far from being a boy and sure as shit isn't my friend. Is he good-looking at least? Let's say he's older. A lot older. The silver fox type? He's definitely not a ten. But then neither am I. Oh. To me you're a... you're a ten. Oh, yeah. Are you hitting on me? Is this you fucking hitting on me, Eddie? Cause you've had your eyes all over me since you've got into this elevator. Tina. - Don't think I haven't noticed! What?! Calm down. That's not what's happening here. And, sweetheart, do I have to remind you you have had a couple of pills? Sure, it's the pills, it's not the pills. It doesn't matter what it is. It's nice to go out to dinners and buy nice clothes and have a sweet apartment in downtown. But at the end, you don't own any of it. None of it. It owns you. He... owns you. Shit... it's gonna sound awful, but he's up there, and I'm here. And... part of me just... hopes the son of a bitch dies. What? What, are we going around the room now, it's my turn? No, I pass. No, thank you. Uh... I mean, I love my wife, I love my baby girl. You know, I ain't havin' no affairs. I don't have no sugar mamas. I don't have no gay shit going on. None of that. You guys can relax. You know, with me, what you see is exactly what you get. So... next. How did you hurt your knee? I'm a messenger. I'm a bike messenger in New York City. I'm not sitting in the back of no black limousine like you. Did you get hit? Yeah, hit-and-run. Cabbie. Pakistani motherfucker, too. So, if it was a hit-and-run, then how did you know where he was from? I mean, I just know. I mean, I... I know. Did you even see his face? I'm on my bike, like, eight, nine hours a day. I see these guys all the time in their cabs. Like what do you mean? The only ones worse than the Pakis be the Filipinos. - Oh, my God. - Crazy behind the wheel. Asian. With that Asian vibe. Well, the Philippines are considered to be part of Asia, so... Anyway, like I said, I don't wanna talk about my shit. So you didn't have any shit. You say you were perfect. Wait a minute, I never said I was per-- I never said any of those type of words. Fuckin' never. What I said was that what you see is what you get. That's what I said, Eduardo. The name is Eddie, okay? It's short for Edwin. There's no fucking Eduardo here. - You could have fooled me. - Oh, really? Oh, so that's how it's gonna be? We're gonna do this Black-Latino shit here? I ain't doin' shit. You doin' somethin' right now. Hey, hey, hey, hey, fellas. Fellas, come on. - What? Tell him. - Tell him! Hey, hey, I am telling both of you. - Well, yessir, boss. - Wow. You're really gonna go there, too. Not everybody has, you know, their own private plane, so I should just hush, right? Do you know why I have my own jet, Michael? Uh... let me think. White... rich guy. You know, for your information, this guy doesn't come from money. His dad worked in a factory. His mom died when he was 12. He went to a public school, and when he barely graduated, he went to work alongside his father and all of his brothers, and that was it, that was decided, that's as far as this guy was gonna go. But you know what he did? He refused to accept that story, because he imagined something bigger for himself. So, at 18 years old, with $60 in his pocket, he hopped on a bus to New York City, and that's where... I met you. Yes... that's where he met me. So, Michael... you could be mad at everything that you don't have or envious of people who have way more than they need, but you have no idea what people go through to get to where they are, or how much money they give to charity, or how they fund kids so they can all go to college. That's who this guy is. All right? That's who he is. Then why are you divorcing him? Hello. - Hello? - Sí, yes? Is that... Is this Eddie's wife, Gloria? Yes. Who is this? Yes, um... You don't know me. I'm calling you... for your husband. You probably know what's going on. He's... At present he's in an elevator and the elevator's stopped, and they're stuck with a group of people, amongst them my daughter. Everybody's safe and... he wanted you to know that... that he loves you very much. Can you grab that water? What are you doing? You guys have all seen those hotel safety videos, right? I'm just gonna make some handkerchiefs. We can filter the smoke. It's the most expensive hankie I've ever had. Italian? Nah, it's David August. Made in America. Just like me. - Eddie. - Yeah? Whaddya say we... try and pry those doors open again? We could try. But we open it, there's gonna be more smoke coming in. Well, you got any better suggestions? - All right. - Okay. Then we'll pry something in there. - Michael. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's see if we can get them open. Stick something-- Your helmet, your bag, something. Eddie, go, go! Ready? Okay... One... two... Three. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Fuck, it's like fuckin' 50 degrees warmer out here. - Can you see anything? - Can we get out? Between floors, a landing, anything? - Gimme a screwdriver. - A screwdriver. Oh, shit. Where's the screwdriver? - It's here, it's here! - Fuckin' screwdriver. Some water? Water? - I'll be goddamned! - What's going on? This is sheetrock. - It's soft. - That's good. These shafts don't have cement. It's drywall. Maybe I could... I could keep... I could keep digging at it, and maybe... maybe we could get all the way through. Son of a bitch! What's going on? Fuck. Oh, man. I'm losing my breath, man. - No, no, no. - I can't breathe. My heart's racing. You're fine, brother, you're fine. Are you a doctor now? I don't think so. I can't... What's going on? What's it feel like? Are you constricted? Is your arm okay? Okay, wait, wait. I feel... Feel like I'm having a heart attack. I feel... my heart. Does that run in your family? I can't breathe. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm Puerto Rican, okay? Fuckin' heart disease is a birthright with us. Eddie, look at me. Take these. What's that? That's for a heart attack? I'm having a heart attack. I'm having a heart attack. - No, you're not having a heart attack. - I can feel. Be quiet. You have to be quiet. Okay. Oh, God, please. - Don't breathe too hard. - Please, please. Have you ever had a heart attack? Help me down. Please help me down. - Let me sit down. - Okay, alright. Relax. It's gonna be okay. Between a panic attack and a heart attack. - You good? - Okay? You can relax? You okay? - Good? - I wanna get outta here! I know, I know. Oh, I'm so the wrong person for this. ...what steps are taken next. David, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we're looking at live pictures of the Pentagon where there is billowing smoke... Come on. ...just reported that he heard an explosion, and right now we're looking at an aerial view of the Pentagon. Officially, nobody knows exactly what happened. I think the picture is pretty clear. Hey, uh, can you hear me, guys? Hello? Metzie, this is Jeffrey! Hey, Jeffrey, um... I don't want to make you nervous or anything, but I am not sure what I'm looking at. I got these blueprints and it says that... the solenoid... is in, like, the locking thing? And it's like a cylinder, and it's probably about... four inches long and it's kind of... You know, it's a locking thing. Do you see it? How many stable positions does it have? I don't know how many stable positions it has. Give me some paper and a pen. Okay, right. All right, hold on, hold on. Hold on. Okay, Metzie. Tell me the diagram, please! The blocking system is called the solenoid. There's a blocking solenoid and it looks like a cylinder. And below it, just below it, there's like a little plunger thing, and then the solenoid itself is four inches long with one-inch diameter and it's at the top of the door on the left side. Okay, I got it. Now, can you tell me how it's mounted, please? It's... at the top of the door on the left side. That's what it says in the book. Okay. Okay. All right, got that. ...sources are confirming the report that one of the planes was a hijacked flight, an American flight from Boston to Los Angeles. They are also now looking into what's going on at the Pentagon. They don't have any details but they have now put government buildings around the city of Washington on a heightened state of alert. Okay. I know what we're looking for. But it doesn't matter, we can't see it. Yeah, listen. Uh, anybody got a mirror? I have a mirror, I have a mirror in my bag. All right, come here. And flashlight. - I got that. - With the mirror. All right, okay. All right. - Where do you want me? - Point it out here. Out here. Come on, come on. All right, all right. Can you point it up a little bit? Tell me where. - A little bit to the right. Okay, okay, just a tick to the left. Right there? Right there... Okay, there. - You see it? - Yes. Can you reach it? I'm gonna need a good three, four more feet, at least. All right, okay, I know what we gotta do. We gotta figure out how I'm gonna get up there. All right. Just, just, just, just... just hop on my knee. Hop on my knee. You gotta... help me up there, brace me. Ready? One, two, three, go! Okay, okay. Can you hand me the pliers? Pliers. Hold it, hold it. Okay. Listen, Eddie. We make it out of here and you wanna still keep gambling, you look me up. I will put you in a whole different casino and you'll bring home a lot more winners than losers. That's a bet, Jeff. That's a bet, okay? Okay. Okay. All right, guys. Eve, a little more this way, please. A little more. - Yes! - Right there. Hold it! Hold it, okay. I can feel... Shit, I can feel... Okay, I've got something here. Okay, guys, I need about another inch. I feel... Oh, shit, I can feel... There. - Okay. - Hold it. I got it. - Fuck! - Shit! Shit! All right. Give me, uh... - What do you need? - Screwdriver! Screwdriver. - Screwdriver - Hurry up! - Okay. - Okay? Oh, God. All right. - You still need the mirror? - Where's the mirror? - I don't know. I got it, I know what I'm looking for. Okay, good. Hold on, guys. Okay, okay, almost... almost... Guys, I need another inch, please. Open the door! Open the door! Right there! Metzie! Metzie, we did it! We got it! What did you do? We opened the door. - We opened the door. - Yes, okay. Hey, listen! What can you see? Okay, we're in between floors. All right, we can't get to the floor above us and we can't get to the landing below us, so we're gonna have to dig our way out of here. Dig your way...? Hold on a minute. The shaft walls, they're soft. - They ain't cement. - I know. You're in the mechanical shaft. We're gonna go through the wall! There you go. There you go. Can I get that mallet, please? Cover your faces. Oh, shit. Okay, here we go, guys. Here we go, here we go. Fuck! ...and they said, quote, that this was "clearly terrorist related, no question about it." They said that they couldn't give any details now, not because they didn't want to share it but because they just don't know yet, they're in the earliest stages. So do they know, Jamie, for example, if a plane... It's okay, Grandma. Dad doesn't work in those buildings anymore. Why are you upset? Oh, some terrible people did some terrible things today, sweetheart. Yeah, but Mom and Dad are okay, right? Mom and Dad had a serious meeting today. Where was the meeting? Well, you spoke to them. Remember? Yeah. Dad said he and Mom are coming home. Did he say that? Well then, that's exactly what's gonna happen. They're probably on their way home now. Everything is going to be all right. Everything's going to be fine. - Grandma. - Nanna needs a hug. Nanna needs a hug right away. Stand back, stand back, stand back. Michael... did you ever hear the one about the billionaire who hires a bike messenger? No. You just did. Straight in, straight in! Looks good. Come on. - There you go. - Into the wall. Gotta get through there, man. - What's in there? - Here, let me get that. - There you go. - Come on, you can do it. - Yeah! What's that? - See anything? Come here and take a look at this. Take a look. What do you see? What's there? What's in there? What is it? It's a janitor's closet. What? Go, go, go, go, go! That's a janitor's closet! Go! Wait, wait, I got it. I got it. Okay, okay. Which one of you ladies wanna go first? Me... first? - Come on. - I'll go, I'll go. - Here, Eve, Eve, Eve. - What? Your belt. - Why? - So you don't get stuck. Hurry up, hurry! Go! Ready? One, two, three! Up you go! Up you go! There you go, Eve! You got it? - Come on, guys! - Come on, get in there! Come on, Eve! She's gonna get cut in half! Get her in, get her in! Everybody lay down! Shit. Hold me. Are you okay? - You better hurry! - Eve... It's fine up here. You have to hurry! Eve, please listen to me! This crate is going down. I know, that's why you have to hurry! You have to come now! I love you. And I swear I will never ignore you again. That's my promise. - Now go! - Jeffrey! - Run as fast as you fucking can! - I will see you in the lobby. I will see you in the lobby. Promise me. I hope. I will see you in the lobby, Jeffrey! Oh... It'll be okay. Dios. They say it's not the fall that kills you. What is it, then? It's the sudden stop at the end. Please get out of my way! Go down, everybody down! Wait, there's some people stuck in the elevator. I think they're down in the lobby. Ma'am, there's people downstairs that can help them. MAN We're going up. To the top, let's go! The FAA has banned all takeoffs at all airports across America.
