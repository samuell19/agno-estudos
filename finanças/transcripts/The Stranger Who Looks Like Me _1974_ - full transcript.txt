(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) -Oh, one for me. -No, you don't get one. Ah, this is good. Just give me a hug. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Pictures everybody. The photographer is here! Four generations! Blood line in this picture only! Over here come on along, along... Get over there around Gramma Dupre. MAN: Here we go. Here we go. MAN: Gramma in the middle. Your mother's family never stands still. Half of them will be blurred. Goodbye, goodbye. No in-laws. The in-laws are later, later! All the Dupre's come along. Go ahead. No, I kinda stay back when they say all blood relatives. -Why, because you're adopted? -Yeah. They don't mean you. You're one of them. Oh, look at those faces out there. JOANNE: They're all from the same great big tree. Johnny, glasses off, glasses off! (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) -PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile. -MAN: Oh yes. PHOTOGRAPHER: Fine, that's good. One more! Well, there you are. Wait a minute. -All right! -Will you take the pictures! You know we'll never be able to stand still this long. (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) GARY: Pick a date and we'll spring it on these wild Frenchmen of yours. JOANNE: Gary, there's something I need to do first. JOANNE: I need to find out where my own roots go. I've been writing and calling for some time now. But it looks like I'm gonna have to go out there to Los Angeles. See that's where I was born. And that's where my original parents might still be living. -I'd really hoped that you would understand. -Yeah. I have to know how I began. I mean, who's responsible for me. Jo, listen, you began the day we adopted you. That's when your life began. That's when we began. Our life began. Dad, I love you both. JOANNE: But, I... I need to know who I am. We can't stop you. We want you to do what... -We want you to be happy, Jo. -MR. DENVER: You know that. JOANNE: Yeah, I know. But I can't help being afraid. Afraid of what? Of the woman who gave birth to you. I've always been afraid of her, whoever she is. I've always felt that she was out there somewhere. And now look, she's pulling you away from us. JOANNE: No, she's not! That's me. That's my need, Mom. I've always been afraid of her. No, that's, ah... That's not what's happening. Jo, what's happening? Nothing has to happen. MR. DENVER: Nothing at all. Just make up your mind that you started... Your life started the day that we adopted you. Forget anything else. Erase it out of your mind. I can't. I'm sorry. But I can't. -Your birth certificate. -Yeah, it's the only clue I've got. Except for the agency, but they haven't told me anything. (SIGHS) All that gives me is the name of the doctor and the date. Reminds me of the day we brought you home. It's as if you're erasing 22 years. Oh, no, Mom! I'm not doing that. (BOTH SIGH) Now look at that sad face of yours. Now... Now that's the same face old Gramma Dupre makes, when she's feeling bad. That very same expression. But, like what about me? When I, ah... When I smile, do I smile like somebody else? I mean, who... Whose eyes do I have? What's my heritage? You have our heritage, honey. Your parents didn't give you one. You have our heritage. (SIGHS) This should be the happiest time of my life. I should be planning my daughter's wedding. Instead you're telling me I don't have a daughter. Mom, I'm... And I'm not your real mother. You are my mother. No, I just raised you for 22 years. Fed you, changed your diapers. Held you when you cried. Uh... You are my mother. (WHISPERS) Then don't do this. Don't try to find her. I have to. -JOANNE: Is Mom up, yet? -MR. DENVER: No. She fell asleep, finally. Did you call a cab? Yeah, it, ah, it should be here any minute, now. Oh, good. (SIGHS) You know, Jo, I... I still think it's wrong of you to go. Well suppose you do find them? What do you expect, huh? To be welcomed? To be embraced? No. Believe me, there's nothing for you out there. Just my roots. Then what good is that? I've got roots, you know that. You know my parents, my family. Do you suppose that I could go there, even today, and be welcome, huh? No. No, it's only here with your mother's family. Because we've... We've got something very special. I know. There's nothing for you in Los Angeles. You won't find anything. Well let me try, huh? (CAB HONKING) Wish me luck, Dad. Wish me luck. Say goodbye to Mom, for me. (ENGINE STARTING) (PLANE WHIRRING) ANNOUNCER: Flight 254, departing for Philadelphia and Washington, is now boarding at gate 14, The East Concourse. Flight 254 departing for Philadelphia and Washington, is now boarding at gate 14, The East Concourse. ANNOUNCER: The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking. (ENGINE STARTING) Operator, yes, I would like to place a long distance call, please. (PHONE RINGING) -Hello. -JOANNE: Hello, Mom, it's me... (EXCLAIMING) We were worried. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. How about you and Dad? MRS. DENVER: We're okay. Umm, Los Angeles is beautiful. JOANNA: Aren't you going to even ask me about Disneyland? We want you to come home, Joanne. (SIGHS) Hey, I just got here, ah... Anyway, I might find out I'm really a princess or something, right? MRS. DENVER: Joanne... It's hard for me to talk to you. All I want to say is "come home." Goodbye, Mom. I'll keep in touch, okay? Bye. I'm sorry, the court has ordered that records be treated as private matters. Yeah, private, yes, between us. Now that's, that's you, the natural parents, the adoptive parents and me. No, no. Each party is kept separated from the other. We have an agreement. We've promised anonymity. Well I'm, I'm not a child anymore. I'm about to be married and I want the facts of my birth. Well that's really not possible. -I'm sorry, but... -No, it is possible. Some people have found out. I've seen half a dozen of you A.I.S. people, you do have a point... Well I, I'm not A.I.S., or whatever. I am a law student and I know that you can find out. I wish I could help you. But I can't. Who is that? -You mean Miss Denver? -Should she be in our file room? Miss Denver, would you like us to call the police? (CLANGING) Yeah, hello, ah, I'd like a number please for A.I.S. No, I, I don't know what it is. Yeah, A.I.S. What is it? Adoptees In Search? No kidding. Yeah, what is it? There are more than five million of us in the U.S. Well, that's adoptees! That's not our membership. There are literally thousands of us who are searching for our parents, trying to round out our identities. So it's only natural we should organize and help each other. I started this group. You're adopted. Yes, and about to give birth, as you can see. So, I asked myself, "What will this child inherit from my side?" The answers are locked away in sealed files. CAROL: That's one of the things we hope to change. There are some cases before the courts now. We feel it's our civil right to be told the particulars of our birth. CAROL: No more sealed files. MIKE: Long live the cause. CAROL: Mike is a clinical psychologist and a great help to us, when we can steal him away from his work. Where was I? The garage! -The garage? -Well I mean it was the garage. Now it's A.I.S. headquarters, the nerve center, the command post. -Hi, Chris. -Hi. New member here. What's her name? She talks. Her name is Joanne Denver. How does it look for her? Well, she only has her birth certificate, no name. Let me see that. (SIGHS) Doesn't even list the hospital. Dr. Joren? That's... That's not too common, that's a plus. I tried the adoption agency, but they wouldn't help. What'd you expect? -Is this it? -Yeah, that's ah, that's all. Think I have a chance? Well, sure. First hospital you call could be the right one. Right? -Right. -But it won't be, right? CAROL: Right. So, if you're serious, you stick to it. You know, they treat this as if it's classified information, the bureaucratic idiots. "I'm sorry I can't help you." And they always say, "I'm sorry." Oh, you want to get started, huh? Yeah, what do we do, pass out guns? This is very serious to me, what is to you? Well, it isn't a war. There's something that is my right to have and people are keeping me from that. How long have you been searching? About eight hours. Hmm, you figure you'll give it about a week? -No, at least a week and a half. -Oh, a vacation! Nice, nice. -Hey, I'm just kidding. -Come, come to L. A. see some of the sights, maybe Disneyland, maybe you'll run into old Mom and Dad at Disneyland. -Yeah, could happen. -Well sure. Listen lucky things happen to people all the time. I've been at this for five years. Look, I'm sorry, don't fly off at me. You know, I could be your sister. Oh, no, no, no. -You're just a tourist, passing through. -No, I'm not. -Oh, yes. -No, I'm not. I've decided you're not my brother. -Can I go out this way? -Yes, but... Yeah, well I'll come by tomorrow, okay? (PHONE RINGING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who is it? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Hi! -Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I have a real bad temper. And that I didn't mean to come down so hard on you, okay? Hey, uh, it's still early and this... This room keeps getting smaller. Pardon? Well, would you like to go out for some coffee or something? I have somebody waiting, ah... I'm double-parked. Well bring him. My treat! It's a girl. Oh. -But, ah, some other time. -Sure, I... Okay, well... Thank you for coming by. -So long. -Okay. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who, uh, what? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Yeah, uh, yeah. What're you doing? Well, ah... I, I was just... -What're you doing here? -I didn't have to work today. So, I thought we'd get started. You've got a thousand calls to make. Oh, right. Well, come on in. I'll just... Give me ten minutes, okay? Don't take too long, this isn't a vacation. I know. Hey, you want to get some breakfast? Oh, that depends. JOANNE: Depends on whether or not you have a girl double-parked out there. (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Yeah, sometime I'll show you the house we're working on now. I'd like to see it. It's got some nice little touches. (CLEARS THROAT) Sometimes I... I make my own changes in the design. I like to visualize people living in the house, especially kids. And, um... Oh, like I'll build little hiding places for them, you know? Little private nooks for them to... To discover. That's nice. Did you grow up in a house like that? No. No. My... My adoptive parents got separated really early, so I just lived, uh... All around the place. Mostly with my so-called relatives. -Were they nice? -No. Oh. Neither was I. Oh. Hey, Joanne, I've got some info on some part-time jobs, if you're interested. Oh terrific! Thank you, Louise. Make a list of all the hospitals. I'm gonna look for anybody with the doctor's name Joren. Thank you. For what? You're gonna help me look all over the country for the Spauldings. Who are the Spauldings? My parents, Alec and Anne. Their address listed in the hospital records was phony. My father listed his occupation as a machinist. Uh, maybe that was phony too, But, ah, I guess I've called over 500 factories and machine shops. "Did you employ an Alec Spaulding 25 years ago, wife, Anne. "If so, please reply and give me his most current address." Hi! -Hi. -Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, that's okay. I like watching people here, anyway. What're we going to be doing at the library? Just checking through some phone books. What phone books? Portland phone book, Seattle phone book. We're looking for the Spauldings, Alec and Anne. Spauldings, there are gonna be a million Spauldings. There are. Why couldn't you have a less common name? -What would you like? -I don't know, Rumplestiltskin? People-watching in this city is really something special. My parents could still be here. So, I can't help studying faces and, and wondering if I'm looking at one of them. It's silly. Not so silly. Wonder what I'd say to them? CHRIS: "Remember me?" JOANNE: Just say, "Hey look at me. I'm all right. I made it." That's right. Excuse me, you gentlemen wouldn't happen to be my father, would you? No, I don't think you are. No, no, no. Well, why did you give me up? I wouldn't have eaten that much, you know. -(CLEARS THROAT) -You wonder that, too? Sure. Listen, my, my parents were married when I was born. I know that much. You know, when a couple has a baby it's usually an event, right? They didn't even take me back from the hospital. (SCOFFING) Some event. Yeah, sure, I wonder why. Sometimes, sometimes I wonder maybe she's looking for me, too. -Any luck? -Not yet. Hello, yes, I would like to know if there is or was a Dr. C. Joren practicing in your hospital. In obstetrics. C. Joren. J-O-R-E-N. I see, um, what about in the past? Do your records go back 22 years? Yeah, I know, but this is important. Well, this is very important. Well, how about if I come in and look myself? (HAMMERING) -Hi. -Hi. -Oh, thank you. -Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) A letter came for you at A.I.S., and Carol thought it might be important, so... So, how do you like the house? Well, it has a very open feeling. Plenty of air, you know. It's a good house. I'm sure it is. Do you like the smell of new wood? Mmm-hmm. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm not gonna use any paint or stain on it, you know. I'm just gonna leave it natural so that the wood can breathe. -It's better that way. -Yeah, it's a good idea. I think if I wasn't doing this for a living, I'd probably do it for fun. -(LAUGHS) Would you? -Yeah. You, uh, built a house for yourself yet? No, I think that's more for families, you know. Thanks for bringing the letter. Oh, yes, I forgot. No, go ahead. You, you open it. Swanson's Tool and Die. Uh, dear Mr. Schroeder, our records show we employed an Alec Spaulding... From 1947 to 1958. Wife's name, Anne, no children. Address: 49 Dalton Lane, San Diego. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) Chris, that's fantastic! CHRIS: You're gonna come with me, aren't you? Yeah. (CAR DOOR OPENING) Hello. -Hi. -Excuse me, uh... Does a man named Spaulding live here? Nope. That's the man I bought the house from. His name was Spaulding. -When was that? Oh, it's been 15 or 20 years ago. Do you know where he is? What city? I don't know. Is, ah, is there anybody around here that might know? Oh, I don't think any of these people were here then. Did you know Spaulding? I only met him once or twice. Well, what does he look like? Oh, he was, uh, dark. And kind of husky, as I remember. And, and his wife? Well, I can't really... I can't get a picture of her. I'm usually pretty good at that, but it's been a long time ago. Did he ever mention a son? No, it was just he and his wife, as far as I remember. (DOG BARKING) He used to live here, sort of. Oh, maybe you'd like to just walk through the place? Come on, come on. If you'll excuse me for just a minute, I'll be right with you. They lived here when I was born. 1948. They must've gone up to L. A. to have me and then they, uh... Came back here. It's a funny feeling being here. (SIGHS) Knowing that, uh... She was here with me when she was pregnant. Just sitting there... Looking at the walls, looking out the window. Just sitting there. Oh, you know, this is my favorite room. This dining room. You know, that Spaulding did all these built-ins. All this wood trim. -He did this? -Yes. He did, uh... All the... All this by himself? It's pretty good work. So... One day... Maybe while he was working on the house, and she was looking out the window... (SIGHS) They decided not to keep me. I wish they hadn't decided to do that. (CRYING) (CRYING) The idea of this meeting is to get other points of view. Let Mrs. Quayle finish. And so, you're trying to find... Trying to find your real parents. What are you trying to find from your real parents? You said the same thing. What is it that you really want from your real parents? It's just to touch. To see that person, to ask why. Um, I don't wanna... You mean to ask why, because they made a mistake? And to know... And to put them down, in other words, right? No, no, I don't wanna do that. I have a dreadful fear of doing that. Uh, I do, I don't wanna push them away by approaching them hostilely or to make them defensive. I... Did you ever think they might have done it -for your well-being, for the best for you? -(CHRIS SCOFFS) That's unbelievable. -Well it's... -Why is that unbelievable? Why? I mean if you're not equipped, at that time, emotionally... To open the door and walk out of the house is, uh... -It's not opening... -That's helping somehow, right? It's not opening the door and walking out, not at all. -MIKE: Chris... -Good luck to you. MIKE: Chris, what would you think if somebody knocked on your door and opened it, without you saying "Come in"? You happen to be looking for your real parents. What if you were satisfied and they were searching you out? Would you want your own privacy? I don't understand what you... MIKE: Well, you're searching for someone... You're searching, you're searching, right? WOMAN: There's something else... MIKE: I'm trying to understand another point of view. Are you always trying to understand another point of view? MIKE: Exactly. You're very emotional about it, Chris, and I guess you have had a bad experience someplace. Two things I'd like to say... Number one, I really kind of object to the use of the word "real parent," in relation to the birth parents. Uh, the real parents are people like me and my husband. -And we've just adopted a baby. -Yeah, okay. I'm their parent. Ah, the other, you know, the other people are birth parents and it's true, they cannot be denied. But I'm the parent. And I would like to feel that my relationship with my child... If my child grows up and is in the position that some of you are in and wants to find the birth parents, will not wipe out or eradicate what we have been to each other. Or what we will be as a family. JOANNE: That's terrific in theory... CHRIS: Can I say one thing about... Uh, there's a lot of guilt pressure put on you. Uh, personally speaking, I guess, I didn't want to make this into a personal forum. My parents made me feel very guilty about wanting to come and look. And I feel like there's a terrible gap there, now, because of that. And, uh, it's not taking anything away from them. It's not negating any kind of life we've had together. You're looking for something they can't give you. They can't give you who had you. They can't give you biological identity or whatever else you want to call it. It's like a great big question mark. And you go and you try and find out, and everybody says, "Well, it's personal, "they're sealed files." Well I'm personal. -I'm the personal part, you know that's... -MAN: Right, I hate it. I'm the one, you know. And I have to live with that question mark, you know. Who the hell am I? I, I, I! You talk about your guilt. What kind of, I'll use the word, pain, is felt by the adopted parents? MIKE: Are you concerned with what they feel? Or is your concern much more important? No, I'm concerned. I'm concerned, but I think you're saying, that what I need to know is not important because you take it for granted. Because you take for granted all the things that I need to know for one instant. I can forget them again. I can not tell someone. I have to give them that pain, because I must get rid of my own. -I need... -MAN: That's small. I can't see any reason to inflict pain. WOMAN: You haven't felt it, Michael. That's I, I, I, again. It's I, I, I when you're talking about you, when all I can talk about is I, I, I! That's what I feel, you don't feel it, Michael. You're not adopted. You can see it, but you cannot feel it. Yes, this is upsetting me terribly, because, uh... Since we've had the baby such a short time, but we feel so close to the situation. You know, there's so much feeling pouring out. And you think of devoting your energy and your time and your love, and then the kid grows up... -And all of a sudden... -WOMAN: They don't go away. They don't go away because they're looking for a biological parent. Well, that doesn't make them go away from you. It's not a threat to you. Maybe I can't understand that at this moment... (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) It just terrifies me. I think part of the problem is that we're really in a transition period. You know, we're coming into a time where things are changing. And this is, this is an example of how things are changing. The laws and the mores that prevailed before were quite different. Adoption, the whole question of adoption was a big secret. Everything is being opened up more in this society and adoption is part of that. And I think this kind of thing is healthy. I personally don't feel... I don't share your feeling of being threatened. At least I don't, right now. You know, I don't know how I'll feel when my baby grows up, and maybe puts the hard question... You kinda have everything all kinda together? WOMAN: Nope, not right, now I do. You're feeling really comfortable, right? -WOMAN: Right now, my baby's little. -Are you now? -She's trying. -WOMAN: Now, wait a minute. -Wait a minute, I just want to finish. -I... I don't like this. Let me just finish my point. I was gonna say, okay so you're looking. And even if you, you find the person and even if you, if you have a relationship, or if you don't, or if they throw you out or they don't want to see you. Okay, so maybe you have to do that. -Maybe you have to... -Now, don't just... Don't just toss things off like that, I mean, you know... Maybe they'll wanna see you, maybe they won't, I mean... She's not suffering for it, you are. But she, she's for you. She's saying she understands. If you're suffering for it, you've gotta do something about it, that's what she said. (ALL TALKING AT ONCE) -Michael! -MICHAEL: Yes, yes, yes. It's like, all of us are getting so angry about everything, and getting so upset about it. But, the point and the reason why we're upset is because even no matter what your reasons are. No matter how much we go, "I, I, I," we're not allowed to. And that's why everyone's getting so upset. That's why it has to be "I, I, I," cause there's no we. Exactly. I mean, I found out I was I was adopted and it didn't bother me that much. And I thought, "Okay, I'll find my parents. Do it." And you find out you can't do it. I seem to be the bad one here. Because I'm a mother who gave up her child for adoption. -MAN: Why'd... -WOMAN: That doesn't make you a bad guy. I don't know. -MAN: Why'd you do that? -WOMAN: I think it's an unknown quantity. Well, I couldn't at the time. -I, I... -MAN: Couldn't what? I couldn't take care of the child. MAN: Do you have any regrets? WOMAN: Would you want to see the child, now? No, no. It would be a stranger. Listen, I can understand. I can understand you having a really hard life, you know. -And having not... -I didn't say that. I didn't say that. Well you said that it, that it was impossible for you to keep your child. I would guess that would mean that you had... I said that I, myself was not emotionally equipped at that time to take care of a child. That somebody else could do it better than I could. Okay, so you give up then, the responsibility of... -And take on a lot of guilt, at that time... -Of this child. Okay, whatever, you know guilt. -You know, that's a whole other story. -WOMAN: Oh, that's not fair. But, wait a second, now. Just let me, just let me get the thought out. I mean you say, I can understand you giving up the responsibility, but then you, you, you also deny the birth. It's, as if you must have made some adjustment in your head... WOMAN: Now, wait a minute. That, that person just wasn't! JOANNE: I want to ask you something. And I don't wanna put a guilt thing on you or make you feel bad or defensive about it. Don't you wonder... Ah, you say you don't, you don't want to see the child. WOMAN: Don't you want to look at her once? Just look at her face, once? I feel that so strongly in me for wanting to see my parents so very much. Ah, how can... And I, I guess I feel I want that on the other side, too. I think you should be aware that, in essence, this is a projection on your part. Your wanting to see and, uh... That, I think, is the basic problem. Projecting your needs and your wants, and your fears onto another person... Who gave birth to you and has given that up. And wishes to remain private. Ah, I know it's uncomfortable for you here. And, ah, it's like you know, any one of us could have been your child. But going back to what Michael said about projecting, which I don't think I'm doing, isn't there an ounce of instinct, a grain of instinct that makes you want to once look at your child in the eyes. Just once, now, when she's grown up? I could be your daughter. I wish you were my mother. I wish you were my mother. It's not that bad, is it? That's all I want, is this. I mean you could be my mother, and it wouldn't be that bad. We could just sit and talk and look at each other, like now. I'm sorry, I just... I would like to know my mother's reaction if someone went to her and asked her that. Probably very like my own. It doesn't alter the fact that I'm obviously not your mother. Uh, I had a boy child, and uh... If I was not equipped to, to raise you... Then I shouldn't have raised you. And I felt it was right. Oh, oh! Hey, why don't you shut up, you know, I wonder about you. If you did find your parents, what would happen? I wonder what would happen with you, because I think you're obsessed. I don't think it would change anything in you. (GASPS) I don't want you to feel like we, we're beating up on you, or anything. It's just that... It's like, you're on one side of a big file cabinet and we're on the other side. And somehow we both want to talk to each other somewhere inside. And they won't let us. So don't, don't feel like we're beating up on you. And if you've been frustrated as long as Chris, that's a lot of phone calls. Well, I go back to my original premise, that all of you are looking possibly for something else. Good morning! Joanne, you have a note. Oh, thank you. Oh, my... (LAUGHS) She found it! Ah, Carol did some telephoning for me and, and she found the hospital I was born in! -WOMAN 1: Terrific! Congratulations! -WOMAN 2: Marvelous. WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Kaufman, telephone please. Dr. Kaufman. Dr. Weitz, telephone please. Dr. Weitz. Mrs. Weiner? That's me. I'm Joanne Denver. You told me to be here at noon. Mmm, you're ten minutes early. Luckily today's meatloaf day in the cafeteria, and I always eat lunch at my desk on meatloaf day. So, if you'll just give me one minute to digest, I'll be right with you. What do you need? The records of my birth here, 22 years ago. Yeah? You two getting married? Well, yes. It's supposed to be a secret. -Congratulations. -Thank you. She's lovely. Yeah, she is, isn't she? Now, your name is Denver? Well, actually I have... I have the date and the time of birth, and the doctor's name, and if you could supply me with the name of the parent, or parents and an address... Oh, you're adopted? JOANNE: Yes. Well, then, we can't examine the records. CHRIS: Wait a minute. Listen. You can examine the records... I'm going to the cafeteria, and don't say anything about the meatloaf. Well, you'll hate it. Just once, would you let me approach it with an open mind? (CHRIS CLEARING THROAT) It's dry. He'll hate it. There's no law that says she can't have the facts of her birth. Can't I at least have a name? I really can't do it. I'm sorry. Well, you see, he won't marry me unless we can find out my real last name. Well, then he's not worth it, honey, believe me. CHRIS: You're not gonna give her the name, right? MRS. WEINER: I told you, I'm sorry. Come on. Why'd you let her off so easy? Because I may want to come back and try again. And if you're gonna make her mad, she's never gonna help. Right? (SIGHS) "I'm sorry," she says. She could care less. Come on. Hey, wait a minute. There's someone I want to talk to. Would you wait for me? They don't give a damn. Oh, will you wait? Okay. I'll wait in the car. WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Warner, maternity please. Dr. Warner. Miss Hampton, telephone please. Miss Hampton. Hello. Don't look up. Just... Just pretend we're not talking. You've been chosen by your country to perform a secret mission. I've been waiting for this moment all my life. Shh! Sorry. Do you have a name or a number? That's your mission, to find out my name. It's in the hospital records. Is this a test? No. Well, you've got to know your name. I'm adopted. I'll give you this. It has my birth date, and the time, and the name of the doctor. Now, you tell me everything else that's in the records. Okay? (SIGHING) It's not so simple. Did you think being a secret agent was easy? (BOB CHUCKLES) This is very important to my country, right? It's very important. Meatloaf was dry, wasn't it? I haven't eaten it yet. It'll be dry. BOB: Got a pencil? Oh, yeah. Only one name was listed. Your mother's. (CLEARS THROAT) Emma Verko. Verko? BOB: V-E-R-K-O. Address. West Wheeler Drive, Los Angeles. How did I do? Your country's very proud of you. Good luck, Miss Verko. Thank you. My name is Verko, and I have an address, my mother's address. Let's go see if she's home. CHRIS: This is 820, West Wheeler Drive. Maybe it was East Wheeler Drive. That's a park. There's a telephone booth, come on. There's about a dozen Verkos, but I don't see an Emma. Let's start at the top. What are you going to say? -WOMAN: Hello. -Hello. Hi. (CLEARS THROAT) I'm new in town and my name is Verko, too. And I was just wondering if, you know, we might be related. And do you know an Emma Verko? -WOMAN: Emma? -Mmm-hmm. WOMAN: No. All right, thank you. Goodbye. No, wait. Call after 5:00, so you get people home. And make sure you call from A.I.S. Well, there aren't that many left. Well, there was at least a dozen there. And there's probably more in the valley. Come on. Take your time. Enjoy the moment. You got the name you started with. Yeah. Verko. Verko... Well, it's not as bad as Spaulding. Come on! -It's not as common, anyway. -No. What do you think that is? Is that Slavic? Could be. So you know you're half Yugoslavian, you know your mother's name is Emma. That's not bad for one day. Do you think maybe I have people in Europe? Sure! Probably a town. -Verko, Yugoslavia. -Oh. No, your father's the mayor. They're gonna have a big parade for you when you arrive. You'll probably get the key to the city. Hello. You're early this morning. You make any coffee? Hey, what's wrong? It's a dead end. There's no trace of them after San Diego. So, it's back to the library, right? More cities, more phone calls, more letters. I'll help you. CHRIS: Help yourself. So, what are you gonna do then, just stop? They're stopping me. People who act as if my adoption is a state secret. A lawyer who's protecting my records as if they were classified information. I'm not trying to steal something. I just want to find somebody! I wanna just find out how I got all screwed up. I wanna know why they gave me away. What about this lawyer? Can we go talk to him again? Talk to him? I've begged him! I... I practically threatened him. I broke his door down. Well, let's try again. Come on. I'll go with you. Hey! Come on. Tourist. -Hello. -Hi. -A new lady. -Yeah. Did the dragon retire? Did you want to see Mr. Gilbert? No. I just need some information. Uh... Mr. Gilbert helped my parents with a matter about 25 years ago. Anne and Alec Spaulding. And, I just thought maybe you might be able to find it for me. SECRETARY: Twenty-five years ago? Mmm-hmm. An adoption. Well, I don't know, but I'll check. If the records aren't here, they're probably in our file room. Oh, Gloria... Yes, I'm trying to find some records for Mr. Spaulding. Do you know where they might be? Last time, I told you never to come back here. He's only asking for one piece of information. No. Nobody cares about this but me. I care about doing my job. I care about people bursting in here and threatening me. I should've called the police the last time. Oh, well... Well, go ahead! If this man ever comes in here again... No, no, no. I think you ought to call the police, right away 'cause I'm a real dangerous person. I might hurt somebody. This is my office. I pay rent on this place. Yeah, right, the world would stop if you showed me the records, right? -You have no right to those records! -Yes, I do! Just who do you think you are? (SHOUTING) I don't know! All right, let's go. Out! -(JOANNE GASPING) -Don't do that! -(GASPING) -Chris! Chris. Chris. Wait! (JOANNE CRYING OUT) Do you hit out at everybody? I'm sorry. Do you blame everything on being adopted? You take it all and you hang it on that one hook, it's gonna kill you. -(SHOUTING) It is a hook! -No, it's a crutch. It's just an excuse. It's gonna kill you. I don't wanna hear it anymore. (DOOR SLAMMING) -Goodnight, Chris. -Goodnight, Chris. Um... My name is Joanne Verko. And, I'm tracing my family tree, and I was wondering if you know of an Emma Verko. Hello, Mrs. Verko? Hi. My name happens to be Verko, too. And I'm tracing my family tree, sort of, and I was just wondering, do you know an Emma Verko? Uh-huh. Oh, your husband might know? Well, fine, thanks. I'll call back then. (CLEARING THROAT) -MAN: Hello? -Mr. Verko? -Yes. -Hi. My name happens to be Verko, too, and I'm sort of looking for my family tree. And I was wondering, do you happen to know anyone named Emma Verko? -What's your name? -Chris. -Chris, huh? -Mmm-hmm. What's your dad's name? Why, do you know Emma? Yeah, I... I know Emma. Emma's my sister. But I don't remember a Chris. Where does your sister live now? She's living in Pasadena. You think we're related? -Yeah, just a minute. -Uh... Well now... My father has a cousin, name of Emma. That's all I know. What did you say your father's name was? John. No, no. No, I'm sorry. I don't know... Now, tell me, is Emma still Emma Verko? No. She's married now. Her name is Emma Cutler. Now, 20 years ago, she lived in Los Angeles, right? Uh-huh. And she has moved to Ridgeton Street? That's 409. West Ridgeton, uh-huh. Hey, thank you very much. (SQUEALS EXCITEDLY) Sure you don't want to call first? No. Know what you're going to say? I'm a... I'm a distant cousin, or I'm selling magazines. I just want to be with her for a while, you know. This is Ridgeton Street. There it is. You're anxious just to look at her, right? That's what I want to do. Just stare. For about a day. Yeah, I want to look at her. I want to ask her about my father. And I want to touch her, you know? Just... Touch her. Yes? Uh... Are you Emma Cutler? Yes. Well, what do you want? Um... I'm Joanne Denver. But I... But I'm adopted, and I've wanted for a long time... I've just wanted to meet you. How old are you? I was born May 10, 1952, Saint Agnes Hospital. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to shock you like that. What do you want? I just wanted to meet you. To... To see you. And I'd like to know about me. I... I couldn't help it. I couldn't keep you. I understand. You see, I was... I wasn't married. Please, you... You don't have to go into all of that. I mean, it was the only thing I could do. Believe me. I do, I really do. I'm sorry. I... I didn't come here to... To make you feel... Nowadays, it's different. See, I know that. It's different. I mean, a single woman can keep a child. They're very open about it. (SIGHING) But... It wasn't like that for me. I understand. I did the best I could for you. It was for you, believe me. You look nice. So do you. How did you find me? It wasn't easy, I guess I was just lucky. Lucky? Can you tell me something about my father? Look, somebody gave you a life, right? You have parents? It... It's been a good life. Nice people. Fine. Fine. Then you ask them anything you want to about their lives. Not me. Not me. See, I don't have to tell you something I don't like to remember. That's... That's why I let you go. Understand? I didn't like my life then, and I wanted to forget about it. And I have forgotten about it. Now, what do you want from me? Why did you come here? I'm sorry that's such a bad memory. It's a bad memory. And I haven't forgotten it. None of it. (TEARFULLY) Why did you come looking for me? I had... I had to see what you looked like. And I had to know what happened. I got pregnant and the man wouldn't marry me, that's what happened. What was his name? I don't want to think about him. I mean, he didn't want me. He didn't want you. So what was I supposed to do? I wanted a chance you know, to get married. And, with an illegitimate child, you know... Well, that wouldn't have been very good for either one of us. So... And I was right. See, I was right. -You did okay, didn't you? -Yeah. See. Better than I could've done for you. So, I was right, what I did. Are these your children? Yes. My husband knows about you. But the kids don't. And I... I don't want them to know. And I don't want my husband to know that you were here. (TEARFULLY) All right. All right, Emma. And you won't come back again, will you? No. Not if you don't want me to. I'm sorry you were disappointed. Oh, I wasn't disappointed. That's all it was, you know. That's... Listen, I don't want you to think I was some kind of a tramp. No, I don't think that. That's all there is to tell. (CHUCKLES HALF-HEARTEDLY) I can't even think. I can't believe you're standing there, and I'm talking to you. -I know. -(SOBBING) Emma. Did you ever have a name for me? You go. Okay? Please! (SOBBING) Please! Please! Carolyn. (CRYING) -(CRYING) -Aw... -Come on. -ATTENDANT: Hi. How are you? WOMAN ON PA: Passenger Warren Travers, flight 728, please pick up the white courtesy telephone. Passenger Warren Travers, flight 728, please pick up the white courtesy telephone. I want to be here when you find what you want. Get your law degree. Was it worth it? All the hunting? She... She didn't give me what I was hoping she would, but she sure took something away. That... That question, that takes up a lot of space, you know. And that's gone, so I guess that's... That's worthwhile. Well, keep in touch. I'll phone. No, no, no. You just write to me. Save your money. I'll start a letter on the plane. I've got a lot to say. I'm not going to let you get away from me for very long, you know. Oh, good. (CHUCKLES) I'm nervous about going home. Are your parents going to meet you? No, I didn't call them. I... I wouldn't know what to say to them. You sure you want to go home? Yeah. I want to be welcomed. I want to be hugged hello. I just don't know how they feel about it. You better... You better call. I'll wait for you here. WOMAN ON PA: Attention, last call for boarding all passengers for flight... -Hello. -Hello, Dad. Hey, Jo! (CHUCKLING) God, it's good to hear you. How are you? It's Joanne, honey, come here. I'm fine. It's good to hear you, too. Yeah, well, listen, we've been thinking a lot about you. We only had two letters. I'm finished here. You're finished? That's wonderful! When are you coming? Listen, you better talk to your mother. When are you coming home? Hi, Mom. I'm getting on the plane now, so it it'll be... She's coming now. What time do you arrive? About 6:00. We'll meet you. Jo, we're glad. Yeah, me too. Okay, honey, we'll see you soon. Okay.
