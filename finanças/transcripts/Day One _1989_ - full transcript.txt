CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY ACORN MEDIA [VIOLIN PLAYS SLOW-TEMPO CLASSICAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN GERMAN] [MAN SPEAKING GERMAN OVER P.A.] I WISH YOU'D THINK IT OVER, LAD. THERE IS NO PLACE BUT BERLIN TO BE A PHYSICIST TODAY. ALL THE BEST PEOPLE ARE HERE. THIS WEEK, ALL THE JEWISH LAWYERS AND JUDGES ARE DISMISSED. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE THEM TO GET TO THE PHYSICISTS? ENGLAND WILL BE SMARTER THAN WE ARE. THEY'LL HAVE ROOM FOR A MAN OF CONSCIENCE. AUF WIEDERSEHEN. I WILL MISS YOU. AS SOON AS YOU FINISH YOUR STUDIES, THE MOMENT YOU GET YOUR DEGREE, LEAVE GERMANY, PLEASE. UNTIL THEN, I WILL WORRY ABOUT YOU. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] HE'S REALLY MAKING TOO MUCH OF THIS POLITICAL BUSINESS, YOU KNOW? MMM. TO SAVE MANKIND, MAYBE FIRST HE HAS TO SAVE HIMSELF, HMM? [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [MAN SPEAKING GERMAN OVER P.A.] SAY, WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN? FROM NOW ON, NOBODY LEAVES GERMANY WITHOUT CLEARANCE. CLEARANCE? WHO FROM? NAZIS. YOU MEAN THAT WAS THE LAST TRAIN? [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [HORNS HONKING] [BELLS TOLLING] [HORN HONKS] FOR GOD'S SAKES, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING. Dr. Szilard: WHEN YOU SAY THAT ANY IDEA OF ATOMIC ENERGY IS A MERE DELUSION, HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE READ H.G. WELLS, WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT AN ATOMIC REACTION THAT UNLEASHES A LIMITLESS POWER AND LEADS TO GLOBAL WARFARE? SIR, IF YOU WOULD JUST BE SEATED... 200 CITIES DESTROYED BY THE "UNQUENCHABLE CRIMSON CONFLAGRATIONS OF THE ATOMIC BOMBS." [CROWD MURMURING] MR. WELLS IS A WRITER OF SCIENCE FICTION WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION. TO SPLIT THE ATOM, TO CAUSE A CHAIN REACTION, TO RELEASE UNLIMITED POWER CANNOT BE. CANNOT? LORD RUTHERFORD, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL TO BE THE WORLD'S GREATEST PHYSICIST. BUT "CANNOT" IS A WORD ONE DOES NOT OFTEN HEAR IN SCIENCE. ON THE CONTRARY, SIR, WHEN ONE IS DEALING WITH A FIXED, IMMUTABLE, IRREDUCIBLE, ABSOLUTE LAW OF PHYSICS, ONE WHICH SAYS SOMETHING CANNOT BE, THEN IT CANNOT BE. IF YOU WERE A STUDENT OF SCIENTIFIC FACT, UNLIKE YOUR MR. WELLS, YOU'D KNOW THAT. ACTUALLY, LORD RUTHERFORD, I AM A PHYSICIST MYSELF. THAT CANNOT BE, EITHER. IT WOULD VIOLATE THE ABSOLUTE, IRREDUCIBLE, IMMUTABLE LAW OF COMMON SENSE. [LAUGHTER] GOOD DAY. [HORN HONKS] IT'S SAFE TO CROSS NOW, SIR. SIR? A FOREIGNER. HE'LL WORK IT OUT FOR HIMSELF. SPLITTING THE ATOM... CAUSE A CHAIN REACTION... CANNOT. IT'S THE EXPLANATION, THE PROOF, HOW THE CHAIN REACTION WORKS. IN PRINCIPLE, YOU'RE SAYING. YEAH, IN PRINCIPLE, OF COURSE. I SEE. AND WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU WISH TO DO WITH IT? I WISH TO ASSIGN THE PATENT TO YOU, TO THE BRITISH WAR OFFICE. WHAT IS IT WE HAVE HERE? IT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH A CHAIN REACTION IS ACHIEVED, RELEASING UNLIMITED POWER TO ILLUMINATE CITIES, RUN SHIPS, CREATE FANTASTIC NEW EXPLOSIVES. "FANTASTIC," YOU SAY. EXCUSE ME, SIR. I HAVE LIVED IN GERMANY. HAVE YOU? HARDLY. I TAKE HITLER SERIOUSLY. I WAS ON THE LAST TRAIN OUT OF BERLIN JUST BEFORE THEY SEALED IT OFF. EVEN IN ENGLAND, I KEEP TWO SUITCASES PACKED AT ALL TIMES. REALLY? I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE ME SERIOUSLY, BECAUSE MY SUITCASES AND I ARE RUNNING OUT OF PLACES TO GO NEXT. YES, OF COURSE. WELL, SIR, VERY GOOD. THANK YOU. IT'S ALL COMPLETE HERE, IS IT? EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE SPLITTABLE ELEMENT. I WOULD START WITH BERYLLIUM AND URANIUM. WELL, THAT SHOULD DO IT THEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED, MR... DR. SZILARD. DR. SZILARD. SORRY. WELL, VERY GOOD TO THINK OF US, I MUST SAY. [SIGHS] [BELL TOLLING] HEY! SZILARD! HOW ARE YOU? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] DR. FERMI, SZILARD, MY OLD HUNGARIAN FRIEND. SZILARD, FERMI, MY NEW ITALIAN FRIEND. COME. SO, HE HAS TOLD YOU? YEAH. WHAT DID HE SAY? NUTS. WHAT DOES IT MEAN, "NUTS"? WHY DO YOU SAY "NUTS"? A CHAIN REACTION IN URANIUM IS ONLY A REMOTE POSSIBILITY. HOW REMOTE? WELL... 10%. 10%? IT'S NOT A REMOTE POSSIBILITY IF IT MEANS WE MAY DIE OF IT. LISTEN, FERMI, YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WORLD. AUSTRIA'S GONE. CZECHOSLOVAKIA? GONE. WHO'S NEXT, HUH? ENGLAND? FRANCE? WE ARE REFUGEES, HUH? AFTER AMERICA, WHERE DO WE GO? PLEASE, GOD, WE NEED TO KNOW. DOES FISSION PRODUCE THE NEUTRONS TO RELEASE THIS ENERGY? DO THE EXPERIMENTS YOURSELF. I DON'T CARE. BECAUSE UNLESS YOU THINK THE PHYSICISTS IN GERMANY ARE IDIOTS, WHICH THEY'RE NOT, UNLESS YOU THINK THAT HITLER DOES NOT CARE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD, WHICH HE DOES... BASTA, BASTA. ENOUGH, SZILARD. I WILL DO THE EXPERIMENTS. AND YOU CAN USE THE LAB, TOO. BARIUM IS READY? YEAH. URANIUM? EVERYTHING IS IN PLACE, WIGNER. REMOVE THE CADMIUM SHIELD. [BUZZING] THE WORLD IS HEADED FOR TROUBLE. THE WORLD IS HEADED FOR GRIEF. A URANIUM CHAIN REACTION HAD NEVER, TILL THIS MOMENT, OCCURRED TO ME. AND YOU SAY HAHN HAS ALREADY SPLIT THE ATOM IN BERLIN? I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME A MOMENT TO GRASP THE IMPLICATIONS. IT'S... VERY FRIGHTENING, ISN'T IT? YES, PROFESSOR EINSTEIN, IT IS. WELL, WHAT CAN I DO? PLEASE, YOU MUST TELL ME. WELL, WHAT WE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS GETTING THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY ATTENTION. IT'S A HARD THING TO PUT THIS IDEA ACROSS TO A MILITARY MIND. DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD APPROACH PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT DIRECTLY? YEAH. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING, ALEX. I WASN'T AWARE OF ANY OF THIS. YOU WANT MY REACTION? IT SEEMS A LITTLE PREMATURE TO ME FOR US TO GET INVOLVED IN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. I DON'T THINK SO. THEY JUST WANT FUNDING FOR SOME EXPERIMENTS. I UNDERSTAND THE GERMANS ARE WORKING ON IT. THEIR PHYSICISTS ARE EXCELLENT. AH, IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE, TOO. THAT'S ANOTHER THING. I'M NOT CONVINCED THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET INVOLVED IN SUCH A COSTLY ENTERPRISE. MR. PRESIDENT, MAY I TELL YOU A STORY? AH! ALEX, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR STORIES. TELL ME TWO. JUST ONE, BUT THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE. DURING THE NAPOLEONIC WARS, A YOUNG AMERICAN INVENTOR OFFERED TO BUILD A FLEET OF STEAMSHIPS WITH WHICH NAPOLEON COULD INVADE ENGLAND. SHIPS WITHOUT SAILS? THIS SEEMED TO THE GREAT NAPOLEON SO IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SENT FULTON AWAY. HAD NAPOLEON MORE IMAGINATION AND HUMILITY, HISTORY WOULD HAVE TAKEN A VERY DIFFERENT COURSE. GET GENERAL WATSON, PLEASE. SO, WHAT YOU'RE AFTER IS TO SEE THAT THE NAZIS DON'T BLOW US UP. PRECISELY. SIR? AH. THIS REQUIRES ACTION. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED, BUT FERMI AND SZILARD HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR AN ANSWER FROM US FOR OVER A YEAR. FOR OVER A YEAR? IT SAYS THE GERMANS ARE WAY AHEAD... SEEMS TO BE TRUE. BUREAUCRACY. F.D.R. SENT IT TO A COMMITTEE. THEY SAT ON IT. WHAT ARE THEY ASKING FOR? SZILARD SAYS HE NEEDS $40,000 TO EXPERIMENT ON A CHAIN REACTION IN GRAPHITE. YOU THINK SZILARD AND FERMI WILL BE WILLING TO MOVE TO CHICAGO, ARTHUR, WORK WITH YOU ON DESIGNING A BOMB? THE WAY THEY FEEL ABOUT HITLER, I THINK THEY'LL DO ANYTHING WE ASK THEM TO. WHAT WE NEED NOW IS EMERGENCY FUNDING TO GET US STARTED. I'LL TALK TO THE PRESIDENT TOMORROW. ERNEST, START URANIUM PRODUCTION AT BERKELEY. IF WE'RE MAKING BOMBS, BETTER GET A MILITARY MAN IN TO HEAD IT UP. THIS COULD TURN OUT TO BE A PRETTY BIG PROJECT. GOOD IDEA. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WE'VE SAT ON THIS A YEAR. CLOSER TO TWO. HOPE WE HAVEN'T LOST TOO MUCH TIME. WE COULD BE IN THE WAR ANY DAY NOW OURSELVES. [HORN HONKING] SORRY I'M LATE. COLONEL. WELL, THAT'S THE LAST TIME I'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY ON MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS. HAVE YOU GOTTEN THE WORD? I GOT MY OVERSEAS COMMAND. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. LET'S HAVE SOME LUNCH. GROVES, OVERSEAS COMBAT IS OFF. THE SECRETARY OF WAR HAS SELECTED YOU FOR A VERY IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT. YOU CAN'T LEAVE WASHINGTON. SIR, I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER IN WASHINGTON. I AM SICK OF WASHINGTON. I'VE BEEN ANGLING FOR MONTHS TO GET THIS COMBAT-ENGINEERS JOB. OUR PROBLEM IS WE NEED AN ORGANIZER AND BUILDER. YOU BUILT THE PENTAGON. YOU CAN BUILD ANYTHING. WITH RESPECT, SIR, I'D LIKE TO GET OUT OF THE CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS AND SEE SOME ACTION IN THIS WAR. IF YOU DO THIS JOB RIGHT, IT COULD WIN THE WAR. OH, THAT THING. [SIGHS] BASIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE DONE. YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE ROUGH DESIGNS, PUT THEM INTO FINAL SHAPE, BUILD SOME PLANS, AND ORGANIZE AN OPERATING FORCE, AND YOUR JOB WILL BE FINISHED AND THE WAR OVER. PART OF THE DEAL IS YOU'LL BE MADE A BRIGADIER GENERAL. [SIGHS] WELL, I'D WANT THAT TO BE OFFICIAL BEFORE I STARTED THE JOB. I'LL BE WORKING WITH A BUNCH OF ACADEMICS AND SCIENTISTS. MY POSITION WITH THEM WILL BE A LOT STRONGER IF THEY THINK THEY'RE DEALING WITH A GENERAL RIGHT FROM THE START, RATHER THAN SOME NEWLY PROMOTED COLONEL. OH, COLONEL NICHOLS IS ALREADY HERE, SIR. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS? Nichols: THEY JUST PUT ME ON IT A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO, SIR. WELL, THEY TELL ME THAT THEY'VE GOT ROUGH DESIGNS COMPLETED. ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS SLAP IT ALL TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT, WHERE ARE THE PLANS? MAYBE IN SOME SCIENTIST'S HEAD SOMEWHERE, SIR. THEY DON'T EXIST. WHAT ABOUT FACTORIES, PRODUCTION FACILITIES? NO, WE'D HAVE TO ACQUIRE PLANNED SITES FIRST. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE FACTORY SITES? NO, SIR. RAW MATERIALS? NOPE, AND NO PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT EITHER. WE'RE GONNA NEED ALL THE URANIUM ORE WE CAN GET. WE MAY BE LUCKY THERE. THE BELGIANS MAY HAVE SENT SOME TO NEW YORK BEFORE THE NAZIS GOT THEIR HOOKS ON IT. GET IT. I'M GONNA GO SEE BUSH. OH, SHALL I CALL AND TELL HIM YOU'RE COMING? NO, I'D LIKE TO SURPRISE HIM! YES, SIR. I'M GOING TO GET THE URANIUM. I'D BETTER. ARTHUR COMPTON AT CHICAGO COULD GIVE YOU A STATUS REPORT ON DESIGN. WHAT ABOUT URANIUM RESEARCH? THAT'S BEING DONE BY LAWRENCE AT BERKELEY. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WORKING ON PLUTONIUM, AS WELL. TELL ME, WHAT EXACTLY IS PLUTONIUM? I MEAN, IS IT A GAS, A SOLID, ELECTRIC SUBSTANCE, WHAT? YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK LAWRENCE DIRECTLY. I'M NOT SURE ANY OF US REALLY KNOWS VERY MUCH ABOUT IT YET. I CAN SEE THAT. IS THIS MEETING REALLY NECESSARY? NO, I COULD TELL THE SECRETARY OF WAR, THE ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF, AND THE PRESIDENT'S SCIENCE ADVISOR THAT YOU'RE TOO BUSY. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] AH, GENERAL SOMERVELL, GOOD TO SEE YOU. COLONEL GROVES, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE MET THE SECRETARY OF WAR, COLONEL STIMSON. IT'S GENERAL GROVES NOW, COLONEL. OF COURSE. YES, WELL, OUR HEARTIEST CONGRATULATIONS. WELL, LET'S GET STARTED, SHALL WE? GENERAL. OUR FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS TO PUT TOGETHER A TOP POLICY GROUP TO OVERSEE THE ATOMIC PROJECT ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. GENERAL MARSHALL AND I SHALL BE FAR TOO BUSY TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED. BUT WE THOUGHT A COMMITTEE OF SOME SEVEN TO NINE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY... THAT'S TOO MANY. EXCUSE ME, SIR, THAT'S TOO MANY. I COULD KEEP THREE PEOPLE REASONABLY WELL-INFORMED AND, OF COURSE, GET THEIR ADVICE. ALL RIGHT. THREE OFFICERS IT IS. FINE. WELL, THAT'S SETTLED. NOW, I THINK WE'D BETTER HAVE A CODE NAME. WE GOT AN OFFICE IN NEW YORK... MANHATTAN. WHAT ABOUT "MANHATTAN"? "MANHATTAN ENGINEERING DISTRICT." "MANHATTAN PROJECT." IS THAT OBSCURE ENOUGH? WELL, GENERAL GROVES, AS HEAD OF THE MANHATTAN PROJECT, PERHAPS YOU'D BE WILLING TO TELL US A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'M GOING TO TENNESSEE THIS AFTERNOON TO INSPECT A LARGE SITE WHERE WE HOPE TO PRODUCE PURIFIED URANIUM... OAK RIDGE. THEN THE LABORATORIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND BERKELEY... AS A MATTER OF FACT, IF I'M NO LONGER NEEDED HERE, GENTLEMEN, I WOULD LIKE TO BE EXCUSED. I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF UNIFORM BEFORE I GO. I'M SURE WE ALL AGREE, GENTLEMEN... THE FEWER QUESTIONS I'M ASKED ABOUT WHERE I'M GOING OR WHAT I'M DOING, THE BETTER OUR SECURITY WILL BE. SO, IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE... THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, GENERAL. [LAUGHTER] WELL, I TOLD YOU, WITH GROVES IN CHARGE, YOU'D START TO GET THINGS DONE. [LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [LAUGHTER] WHY IS EVERYONE JUST SITTING AROUND TALKING? WHY AREN'T THEY WORKING? THEY ARE... EXCHANGING IDEAS, GENERAL. THIS WAY. IS THIS CASE, WE CAN EXPRESS THE FLUX JUST AS A... NO, NO, NO, NO. NOT EVEN AS AN ESTIMATE. [INDISTINCT ARGUING] GENTLEMEN, I WANT YOU ALL TO MEET GENERAL GROVES, WHO'S HEADING UP OUR ATOMIC EFFORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. HE'D LIKE A BRIEFING OF WHAT WE'RE DOING DOWN HERE. SO, WHY DON'T, LEO, YOU AND ENRICO HANDLE THIS? GENERAL, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET ENRICO FERMI. I'VE HEARD OF YOU. LEO SZILARD. I'VE HEARD OF YOU, TOO. EUGENE WIGNER. PLEASE, DON'T GET UP. DR. VINCENT. DOCTOR. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? Dr. Vincent: WE'RE CONSIDERING DIFFERENT METHODS FOR REACTOR COOLING. Dr. Szilard: THERE ARE FOUR METHODS WE ARE CONSIDERING. WATER AND AIR, OF COURSE. THAT'S RIGHT. AND HELIUM AND HEAVY WATER. ACCORDING TO YOUR NUMBERS, WHICH ARE THE LIKELIEST TWO? AT THIS POINT, I WOULD SAY HELIUM AND AIR. MM-HMM. AND THE LIKELIEST ONE? UH, HELIUM. WELL, WHY NOT JUST DROP THE OTHER THREE... WORK ON HELIUM? CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES... THAT'S THE WAY WE DO IT IN THE ARMY. [LAUGHS] WELL, MAYBE WE COULD DO THAT. WELL, WE DON'T NEED TO DECIDE ABOUT COOLING SYSTEMS TODAY. WHAT I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT AWAY, GENTLEMEN, IS HOW MUCH URANIUM OR PLUTONIUM WILL ONE OF THESE BOMBS REQUIRE? THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CONCENTRATING ON, ISN'T IT? NO, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS, GENERAL. THE COOLING SYSTEM IS PART OF THE WHOLE PROCESS. I UNDERSTAND THAT, DOCTOR. GOOD. WHY DON'T WE DO THE NUMBERS FOR YOU... SHOW YOU WHERE WE ARE? LET ME DO THAT FOR YOU. WHAT WE CALCULATE IS THE CRITICAL MASS FOR A URANIUM BOMB. THE CRITICAL MASS IS THE MASS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE CHAIN REACTION. IF WE CONSIDER ONLY THE FREE PARTS OF THE NEUTRON IN THE URANIUM, IT SHOULD BE IN THE ORDER OF THE CRITICAL RADIUS AND CAN BE CHARACTERIZED BY THE CROSS-SECTION FOR FISSION FOR THE NEUTRONS TIMES THE NUMBER OF ATOMS PER CUBIC CENTIMETER, WHERE "N" IS EQUAL TO 6 TIMES 10 TO THE 23 OVER 235, THE MASS NUMBER FOR URANIUM... THIS SYMBOL IS THE DENSITY IN GRAMS PER CUBIC CENTIMETERS. WHICH IS EQUAL TO 4 PI OVER 3 TIMES 235 OVER 6 TIMES 10 TO THE 24th TIMES... Groves: JUST A MINUTE, PROFESSOR VINCENT. I DON'T SEE HOW YOU MOVED FROM THE SECOND EQUATION TO THE FOURTH. IN THE SECOND EQUATION, YOU HAVE 10 TO THE 23rd POWER, AND THEN SOMEHOW IN THE FOURTH IT BECOMES 10 TO THE 24th? YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S WRONG. YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DOCTOR. JUST A SECOND. ACTUALLY, IT BRINGS UP A VERY GOOD POINT. WHEN YOU DO GET YOUR FIGURES, GENTLEMEN, JUST HOW ACCURATE WILL THEY BE? AT THE MOMENT, WITHIN... WITHIN A FACTOR OF 10. A FACTOR OF 10? THAT'S IDIOTIC. THEY'RE UNUSABLE. IT'S LIKE TELLING A WEDDING CATERER TO HAVE FOOD READY FOR 10 GUESTS OR 1,000 GUESTS. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME, IF I'M SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF BOMBS PER MONTH, HOW DO I BUILD A FACTORY BASED ON SUCH IMPRECISE INFORMATION? SHALL I DESIGN FOR 3 BOMBS A MONTH, 3/10 OF A BOMB, OR 30 BOMBS? I NEED ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS, GENTLEMEN. WHEN AM I GONNA GET THEM? WE ARE ALL WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO GET YOU THOSE ANSWERS, GENERAL. IT SURE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME! WELL, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT READY FOR ME HERE. I'LL GO ON TO BERKELEY. I'LL BE BACK HERE IN A FEW DAYS. MAYBE YOU'LL BE READY BY THEN. GENTLEMEN, LET ME POINT SOMETHING OUT TO YOU. WHEN I WAS AT WEST POINT, I TOOK ALGEBRA, DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY, AND TRIGONOMETRY. I DID VERY WELL IN THOSE COURSES. AND THEN I TOOK THEM AGAIN. NOW, YOU MAY KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE A PhD. BUT I HAVE 10 YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION AFTER I ENTERED COLLEGE... 10 YEARS. I BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO PhDs, WOULDN'T IT? LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, DR. COMPTON. THEY HAVE WORK TO DO. THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. HOW CAN YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE THAT? Groves: THEY DON'T HAVE THE FIRST IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. IT'S A SLOPPY, UNDISCIPLINED, DISORGANIZED MOB. THEY DON'T DO ANY REAL WORK AT ALL, ALL DAY LONG. THEY JUST SIT THERE AND GOSSIP. I THINK I MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON THEM. TOO MUCH THEORY AT CHICAGO. OUT HERE, YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE URANIUM PREPARATION GOING ON. WELL... WELL, THIS IS MORE LIKE IT. HOW MUCH URANIUM DO YOU GET? WELL, ACTUALLY, WE DON'T GET ANY YET. THIS IS STILL ALL EXPERIMENTAL, YOU SEE. WELL, WHEN YOU DO START TO GET URANIUM, DOCTOR, HOW PURE WILL IT HAVE TO BE? AH, WELL, I'M ONLY THE EXPERIMENTALIST HERE, GENERAL. YOU'LL WANT TO ASK OUR THEORETICIAN, DR. OPPENHEIMER. YOU KNOW, DR. LAWRENCE, YOU'D BETTER DO A GOOD JOB HERE. YOUR REPUTATION DEPENDS ON IT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, GENERAL, MY REPUTATION IS ALREADY MADE. I'VE WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN PHYSICS. IT'S YOUR REPUTATION THAT DEPENDS ON THIS PROJECT. I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE OPPENHEIMER WORKS. THEY TELL ME YOU'RE THE EXPERT ON ALL THIS, DR. OPPENHEIMER. THERE ARE NO EXPERTS, GENERAL. THIS FIELD IS TOO NEW. IF I MAY, LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, WHICH PROVES THAT NONE OF US SO-CALLED EXPERTS REALLY KNOWS VERY MUCH. GO AHEAD. I HEAD UP A STUDY GROUP ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE BOMB, AND ONE OF OUR PHYSICISTS, EDWARD TELLER, MADE SOME CALCULATIONS WHICH SHOWED THAT WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF, IT WOULD SET FIRE TO THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE. WELL, THE WHOLE SKY WOULD CATCH FIRE, AND WE'D DESTROY THE WORLD. SO, NATURALLY, I TOOK THE NEXT TRAIN BACK TO CHICAGO TO TELL ARTHUR COMPTON WHAT WE'D FOUND. AND COMPTON SAID THAT THAT WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE CATASTROPHE, AND IT'S BETTER TO RISK SLAVERY UNDER THE NAZIS THAT RUN THE CHANCE OF DRAWING THE FINAL CURTAIN ON MANKIND. WE COULDN'T MAKE THE BOMB. BUT I CAME BACK HERE. WE DID SOME MORE FIGURING AND FOUND A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT EDWARD TELLER HADN'T TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. WE REFIGURED THE ODDS. NOW WE THINK THE CHANCES ARE 3 IN A MILLION WE'LL DESTROY THE WORLD. AND ON THAT BASIS, COMPTON SAID, "GO AHEAD." SO, YOU SEE, NONE OF US KNOWS VERY MUCH, REALLY. IT'S ALL TOO NEW. HMM. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THE PROJECT? ABOUT A YEAR. WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO? WHAT'S YOUR JOB? WELL, MY TITLE, THEY TELL ME WITH A STRAIGHT FACE, IS "COORDINATOR OF RAPID RUPTURE." BUT WHAT I ACTUALLY DO IS LEAD THE SEMINARS ON BOMB-DESIGN THEORY... WHAT WILL HAVE TO GO INTO IT. AT THE MOMENT, WE'RE CONCERNED WITH THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DETONATION. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE? LESS THAN A MILLIONTH OF A SECOND. TELL ME, DR. OPPENHEIMER, THIS ATOMIC-FISSION BOMB... DO YOU THINK IT COULD BE DONE? YES. YES. TECHNICALLY, IT'S A SWEET PROBLEM, AND, YES, IT CAN BE DONE. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO BUILD? I'D GUESS TWO YEARS. WELL, HE GIVES YOU STRAIGHT ANSWERS... UNLIKE THOSE GUYS IN CHICAGO. I LIKE TALKING TO YOU. DOCTOR, HOW ABOUT MEETING ME IN CHICAGO ON THURSDAY? I'VE GOT TO TAKE THE TRAIN DOWN TO WASHINGTON. YOU COULD RIDE DOWN WITH ME. WE COULD HAVE A REAL TALK. FINE, CERTAINLY. JUST GIVE ME MY ORDERS, GENERAL. [BELL TOLLING] Man: WE NOW MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH IT. IT IS TIME TO BUILD A NUCLEAR REACTOR. AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS... CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS AND SO FORTH... WE THINK THE PLACE TO BUILD IT IS RIGHT HERE. HERE? YOU MEAN ON CAMPUS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO? THE SQUASH COURTS, UNDER THE STANDS AT STAGG FIELD. THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE? THERE'S NO PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVE, NO. WHO'LL DO THE EXPERIMENT? FERMI AND SZILARD. FERMI WILL BE IN CHARGE. WHAT ARE THE RISKS? WE HAVE COMPUTED WITH GREATEST OF CARE. WE ARE CERTAIN THERE WOULD BE NO RUNAWAY REACTION TO RELEASE LETHAL AMOUNTS OF RADIATION. WE ALSO HAVE RULED OUT AN ATOMIC EXPLOSION. ON PAPER. OF COURSE, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN AT ALL. SIR, WE WILL ALLOW THE REACTION TO GROW ONLY VERY SLOWLY SO IT CANNOT GET OUT OF CONTROL. BUT IF IT DOES... THE LIKELIHOOD... IF IT DOES, YOU COULD RADIOACTIVELY POISON OR BLOW UP CHICAGO. IF YOU'RE WRONG. BUT NONE OF YOU THINKS YOU'RE WRONG. ALL RIGHT, PROCEED... FOR NOW... FOR NOW! INFORM ME IMMEDIATELY OF ANY AND ALL DEVELOPMENTS. ALL RIGHT, THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS IS A NEW POLICY. BEGINNING TODAY, ALL SCIENTISTS WILL NOT... I REPEAT... NOT DISCUSS WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES WHAT THEY'RE WORKING ON. NOW, THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS. THE FIRST, OF COURSE, IS SECURITY. WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY VITAL SECRETS FALLING INTO ENEMY HANDS. THE SECOND IS TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFICIENCY BY MAKING PEOPLE STICK TO THEIR KNITTING! EACH MAN WILL KNOW ONLY WHAT HE NEEDS TO KNOW IN ORDER TO DO HIS JOB AND NOTHING ELSE. YES, DR. SZILARD? GENERAL, THAT WON'T WORK. LET ME TELL YOU HOW WE FUNCTION HERE. WE HELP EACH OTHER. WE BUILD ON EACH OTHER'S THEORIES. I KNOW, TO YOU, IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE WASTING TIME, BUT REALLY, IT SPEEDS THINGS UP. IT MAKES THE WORK GO FASTER, NOT TO MENTION BETTER. OUR JOB IS TO BUILD A BOMB HERE, NOT TO ENABLE YOU TO SATISFY YOUR INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY. YEAH? WELL, IF WE CAN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER, IT COULD DELAY OUR WORK. IT COULD HELP THE GERMANS, WHICH I'M SURE NONE OF US WANTS. YOU HAVE ONE JOB HERE... ONE... TO BUILD AN ATOMIC BOMB THAT WILL END THE WAR AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. NOW, GET ON WITH IT. DR. COMPTON, MAY I SEE YOU? [SIGHS] I WANT MR. SZILARD FIRED. I WANT HIM OFF THIS PROJECT TODAY. GENERAL, I CAN'T DO THAT. EVERYONE ELSE WILL QUIT. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT, I WANT MR. SZILARD FOLLOWED... 24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE, 'ROUND THE CLOCK. Lansdale: WE GOT A MORE IMMEDIATE SECURITY PROBLEM THAN JUST SZILARD, GENERAL. WHO'S THAT? OPPENHEIMER. HE DATED FOR THREE YEARS ONE JEAN TATLOCK. SHE'S AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. HE JOINED WITH HER, THROUGH HER, SUCH LEFT-WING ORGANIZATIONS AS FRIENDS OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE, CONSUMERS UNION, AMERICAN COMMITTEE FOR DEMOCRACY AND INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM, HELP SET UP A BRANCH OF THE TEACHERS' UNION. A LOT OF HIS FRIENDS ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. IS HE A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY? WE HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKING FOR VERY LONG YET. BUT HIS WIFE, KITTY, WAS. HIS BROTHER IS. KITTY WAS MARRIED TO JOE DALLET. COME IN. MR. OPPENHEIMER, COME IN, COME IN. HAVE YOU HAD YOUR DINNER? JUST FINISHED. WELL, HOW ABOUT SOME CHOCOLATE? UM, NO. YOU KNOW COLONEL NICHOLS. HAVE YOU MET COLONEL LANSDALE YET? HE'S HEAD OF OUR SECURITY. COLONEL. DOCTOR. SECURITY. YOU'VE GOT AN INTERESTING JOB. YOU NEED TOP SECURITY ON A JOB LIKE THIS. THE TRICK IS TO GET IT WITHOUT DEPRESSING THE SCIENTISTS WHO DO THE WORK. WELL, AT THE MOMENT, WE'RE JUST ASKING THEM TO FILL OUT A FEW QUESTIONNAIRES. WELL, WHEN YOU GET TO MINE, YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT I'M NOT A COMMUNIST. BUT I'VE BELONGED TO PROBABLY EVERY COMMUNIST-FUNDED ORGANIZATION ON THE WEST COAST. DO YOU BELONG NOW? NO, NOW I'M NOT INVOLVED IN ANYTHING. THE ONLY THING I WANT TO DO IS HELP BUILD THIS BOMB AND TO WIN THE WAR. THE ONLY SECURITY PROBLEM THAT BOTHERS ME RIGHT NOW ARE ALL THOSE YAKKERS THAT WE'VE GOT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO KEEP SECRETS IN A PLACE LIKE THAT? YOUR PEOPLE THAT WAY OUT THERE IN BERKELEY, DOCTOR? OH, WE TALK, TRY TO HELP EACH OTHER WITH IDEAS. BUT IF THAT'S A PROBLEM... AND I CAN SEE HOW IT WOULD BE HERE... WHY NOT GET ALL THE SCIENTISTS TOGETHER IN ONE FAR-OFF PLACE? BRING THEM IN FROM CHICAGO, BERKELEY, WHATEVER, TO A PLACE YOU CAN CONTROL, MAKE IT AS SECURE AS POSSIBLE, AND IT WOULD HELP US WITH BOMB DESIGN, TOO, HAVING EVERYBODY TOGETHER. DID YOU JUST COME UP WITH THIS IDEA? WHAT IF WE TOOK ALL THE SCIENTISTS, PUT THEM INTO UNIFORM, SWEAR THEM IN, GIVE THEM COMMISSIONS, MAKE THEM OFFICERS? THEY'D BE SUBJECT TO MILITARY DISCIPLINE. HOW WOULD THAT BE? I'D BE PROUD TO BE AN OFFICER. WHO WOULDN'T? THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I LIKE THE WAY YOU THINK, DOCTOR. YOU'VE GOT SOME GOOD IDEAS. WHEN YOU TALK, YOU MAKE SENSE. SOME FAR-OFF PLACE? HMM. NEED A GOOD MAN TO HEAD THAT UP. YEAH. GOT ANY IDEAS ABOUT THAT? YOU NEED A THEORETICIAN, AN EXPERIMENTALIST, AND AN ADMINISTRATOR ALL IN ONE. LAWRENCE, MY BOSS AT BERKELEY... HE'S THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD FOR IT. THEN McMILLAN. HE'S DOING RADAR WORK IN BOSTON. PANOFSKY FROM PASADENA. ROBBY FROM COLUMBIA. OH, YOU COULD GET ANYBODY YOU WANTED. AFTER ALL, YOU'RE OFFERING THEM THE BEST, SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT JOB IN THE WORLD TODAY. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] I KNOW OPPENHEIMER'S BRILLIANT. EVERYONE SAYS HE'S A GENIUS. BUT SECURITY SAYS ABSOLUTELY NO. COMPTON AND LAWRENCE BOTH HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP QUALITIES. BUSH AND COLEMAN SAY HE'S NOT A GOOD ADMINISTRATOR. HE SAYS HIMSELF THAT WHAT WE NEED IS AN EXPERIMENTALIST, AND HE'S ONLY A THEORETICIAN. HE'S NEVER WON THE NOBEL PRIZE. HE WON'T HAVE THE PRESTIGE AMONG THE OTHER SCIENTISTS. IS THERE NOBODY ELSE YOU'D BE SATISFIED WITH? GENERAL... WHAT IF HE REALLY IS A COMMUNIST? IF HE'S A COMMUNIST, I'LL BLOW THE WHOLE DEAL SKY-HIGH. I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S... [SIGHS] THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT OPPENHEIMER. HE HAS ABILITY. [CHUCKLES] MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT HE AGREES WITH ME. [CHUCKLES] WHATEVER IT IS, HE'S THE MAN. I WANT HIM. ALL RIGHT, NOW. IF THE REACTION STARTS TO RUN OUT OF CONTROL, YOU CUT THE ROPE INSTANTLY. YOU, YOU, AND YOU, DOUSE THE PILE INSTANTLY. YOU MAY STEP UP THERE. STEP CLOSER. GEORGE WILL PULL OUT THE ROD A LITTLE AT A TIME. WE SHALL TAKE MEASUREMENTS AND VERIFY THAT THE PILE WILL KEEP ON ACTING AS WE HAVE CALCULATED. READY? GO AHEAD, GEORGE. [CLICKING] [CLICKING INTENSIFIES] IT SHOULD LEVEL OFF IN FIVE SECONDS. PULL IT OUT ANOTHER FOOT. [CLICKING INTENSIFIES] IT WILL LEVEL OFF NOW. ONE MORE FOOT. THIS WILL DO IT. NOW THE PILE WITH CHAIN REACT. [CLICKING INTENSIFIES] THE PILE HAS GONE CRITICAL. [CLICKING CONTINUES] ZIP IN! [CLICKING STOPS] [SIGHS] THE PILE IS SECURE. YES! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WAIT A MINUTE! I CAN'T HEAR! BEDLAM IN HERE! ARE YOU STILL THERE, JIM? ENRICO! ENRICO! WE'VE GOT DR. CONANT ON THE LINE IN WASHINGTON. LET'S OPEN A BOTTLE. THE ITALIAN NAVIGATOR HAS LANDED IN THE NEW WORLD. AND THE NATIVES WERE FRIENDLY! [LAUGHTER] NO MORE EXPERIMENTS. NOW WE START TO PRODUCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LEO. HEY, CONGRATULATIONS. WHAT? WHAT? THIS DAY WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A BLACK MARK AGAINST MANKIND. WE'RE OUT OF MARTINIS. WANT SOME HELP? WOULD YOU HELP SHAKESPEARE TO WRITE OR CARUSO TO SING? GO! DON'T BE SO CHINTZY ON THE GIN THIS TIME. NO, IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH A BOMB WOULD EVER BE USED. ROBERT, WHO ARE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE ARGUING WITH TELLER? THEY'RE FROM LOS ALAMOS. I GOT THEM AS A JOB LOT AT PRINCETON. [LAUGHS] AS I WAS SAYING, THE BOMB WOULD NEVER BE USED ON PEOPLE. AS SOON AS WE GET IT, WE'D ONLY USE IT TO DICTATE PEACE TERMS. AMEN. TWO OR THREE YEARS IN THE DESERT, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE, KITTY, YOU'LL ROT ON THE VINE THERE. YEAH? LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. I'LL BE ALONE WITH 1,000 HORNY MEN. I WAS WONDERING, OPPIE. BY ANY CHANCE, DO YOU KNOW A FRIEND OF MINE FROM AROUND HERE, CHARLES SATTERLEE? OH, VAGUELY. ENGINEER FOR UNIFIED OIL. MM-HMM. USED TO LIVE IN RUSSIA. HOW'S THIS? THE HAND OF THE MASTER. CHARLES WAS SAYING THAT HE THINKS IT'S A DAMN SHAME. EVEN THOUGH THE RUSSIANS AND AMERICANS ARE ALLIES, THERE'S NO... OH, THANK YOU. THERE'S NO SHARING OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION BETWEEN THEM. HE HAPPENED TO MENTION THAT HE HAD WAYS OF GETTING TECHNICAL INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS... IF ANYONE WERE INTERESTED. I WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT, HAAKON. NOTHING AT ALL. OF COURSE NOT. OF COURSE NOT. I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT... YOU KNOW, BETWEEN FRIENDS. WELL, LET'S REJOIN THE PARTY, SHALL WE? I'M GLAD THAT BERKELEY IS STILL GOING TO BE HOME. NOT SELLING THE HOUSE, EH? THAT'S GOOD. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.] Woman: HEY, FOLKS. WELCOME TO THE LOS ALAMOS WALDORF. CONNIE TROWBRIDGE. I'M AN OLD-TIMER HERE... BEEN HERE SINCE THURSDAY. [CRYING] AW, THEY ALWAYS CRY WHEN THEY GET OFF THAT BUMPY ROAD FROM SANTA FE. I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU THERE'S A BRIEFING FOR THE MEN IN THE MAIN HALL IN FIVE MINUTES. WHERE'S THAT? UH, IT'S THATAWAY. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] GENTLEMEN. GENTLEMEN! FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME, I'M GENERAL GROVES. YOU ARE HERE TO BUILD AN ATOMIC BOMB. IF YOU SUCCEED, YOU WILL WIN THE WAR AND SAVE COUNTLESS AMERICAN LIVES. IF YOU FAIL... I WILL HAVE TO APPEAR BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE AND JUSTIFY YOUR SQUANDERING OF THEIR MONEY. SO, DON'T FAIL. [LAUGHTER] DR. OPPENHEIMER WILL BRIEF YOU ON YOUR ASSIGNMENTS. Oppenheimer: WELCOME, GENTLEMEN. EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR. WHEN I CALL A MEETING FOR 1400 HOURS, WE START AT 1400 HOURS. GO AHEAD, DOCTOR. Oppenheimer: WELL, UM... WELL, I'M EXCITED. WHAT ABOUT YOU? [LAUGHTER] WE'RE GATHERED HERE TOGETHER TO LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN, TO CREATE THE HITHERTO IMPOSSIBLE. AND TO ACCOMPLISH OUR TASK, WE'VE ASSEMBLED IN THIS ROOM THE VERY BEST MEN, EACH CHOSEN INDIVIDUALLY TO WORK WITH US. THERE'S NOT ONE OF YOU I'M NOT HONORED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH. EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU IN YOUR LABORS, WE WILL. COME SEE ME OR ED CONDON HERE, WHO'S COME DOWN FROM WESTINGHOUSE TO LEND A HAND ON ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS. HEY, FELLAS. HEY. HI, ED. ED HELPED PREPARE THOSE ORGANIZATIONAL CHARTS YOU ALL HAVE IN YOUR PACKETS, WHICH PROVE HOW ORGANIZED WE ARE... ON PAPER. [LAUGHTER] AS YOU KNOW, SOME OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A YEAR OR MORE. I'VE ASKED BOB SERBER TO TELL YOU WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW, TOO. BOB, IT'S YOURS. DON'T CALL IT A BOMB, BOB. CALL IT A GADGET, HUH? THE U-235 URANIUM BOMB WILL HAVE A CRITICAL MASS OF 15 KILOGRAMS. THE PLUTONIUM BOMB ABOUT 5 KILOGRAMS. MANUFACTURING PLANTS AT OAK RIDGE, TENNESSEE, AND HANFORD, WASHINGTON, WILL MAKE THE MATERIALS. BUT WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE THE GADGET READY BY THEN... TWO YEARS OR LESS. HOW MUCH U-235 DO WE HAVE SO FAR? JUST MINUTE SMEARS. CAN WE GET SOME TO FOOL AROUND WITH? YES. WHEN, WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE. HOW ABOUT PLUTONIUM? IT DOESN'T EXIST YET. SO, OKAY, WE'LL DO "LET'S PRETEND" FOR A WHILE. Oppenheimer: WE'LL STAY IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH OAK RIDGE AND HANFORD AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET AND WHEN WE CAN GET IT. MEANWHILE, WE'VE GOT A LITTLE CATCHING UP TO DO. ATTEN-HUT! BE SEATED. WELCOME TO LOS ALAMOS... WHERE, AT GREAT EXPENSE, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS GATHERED THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF CRACKPOTS THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. [LAUGHTER] HOWEVER, THESE CRACKPOTS ARE ENGAGED ON A MISSION OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO YOUR COUNTRY. YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE TO MAINTAIN SECURITY HERE. SPECIFICALLY, THAT MEANS KEEPING THE GERMANS, THE RUSSIANS, OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER, FROM LEARNING ABOUT OUR EFFORTS. HOW YOU WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT MISSION WILL BE THE ASSIGNMENT OF COLONEL PASH... CAPTAIN DeSILVA... AND COLONEL LANSDALE. COLONEL LANSDALE WILL NOW TAKE OVER THE BRIEFING. [CLEARS THROAT] THERE ARE FOUR AREAS WE'LL BE CONCENTRATING ON. NOT ONE LETTER GOES IN OR OUT THAT WE DON'T READ... NOT ONE PHONE CALL WE DON'T HEAR... NOT ONE OFFICE WE DON'T MONITOR. PERSONAL SURVEILLANCE... THAT ONE'S GONNA BE A LITTLE TRICKIER. [INDISTINCT ARGUING] WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT EXPLOSION. AND WHAT I'M THINKING IS THAT MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT IMPLOSION. [PEOPLE MURMURING] WH-WHAT I MEAN IS, INSTEAD OF EXPLODING OUT, MAYBE... MAYBE WE OUGHT TO BE SQUEEZING A MASS IN ON ITSELF FROM ALL SIDES AT ONCE. N-NOT DRIVE IT APART TO GET FISSION... TOGETHER. NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO SET OFF A ZILLION CHEMICAL EXPLOSIONS AT THE SAME TIME. THEY'D HAVE TO BE UNIFORM AND SO VIOLENT... THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DEGREE OF COMPRESSION ANYTHING LIKE IT. IT MUST BE EXPLOSION... THE GUN METHOD. [INDISTINCT ARGUING] IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. YOU'VE NEVER WORKED ON EXPLOSIVES, HAVE YOU, NIEDERMAYER? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM? NOTHING. [LAUGHTER] SIT DOWN, GOOFUS. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Serber: OKAY, LET'S KEEP GOING HERE. Fermi: LET'S GET BACK TO THE GUN METHOD. FIRST, THE MAIN PROBLEM IS HOW TO AVOID PRE-DETONATION. YOU TOLD ME IF I CAME HERE, I COULD WORK ON THE FUSION WEAPON AND I COULD WORK ON MY OWN. EDWARD, THAT'S RIGHT, I DID. AND YOU CAN. INSTEAD YOU HAVE ME WORKING IN THE THEORETICAL DIVISION UNDER HANS BETHE. FIRST BETHE, THEN TELLER ASSISTING. EVERYTHING I PROMISED YOU, YOU'LL GET. THIS IS JUST UNTIL WE GET STARTED. IT'S JUST FOR ORGANIZATIONAL PURPOSES. HELP ME OUT WITH THIS, EDWARD. YOU HAVE CHEATED ME. I WANT YOU TO WORK ON YOUR OWN. YOU'RE ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT, INNOVATIVE MEN WE HAVE, AND YOU CAN HELP US TREMENDOUSLY IN THE THEORETICAL DIVISION. [MURMURING] HELLO. HI. NIEDERMAYER, I WANT YOU TO WORK ON IMPLOSION. WHAT DID YOU SAY? I'M MAKING YOU GROUP LEADER... IMPLOSION EXPERIMENTATION. WAR RESEARCH ISN'T LIKE COLLEGE RESEARCH. DON'T HAVE TO BE CHEAP. USE AS MANY MEN AND AS MUCH EQUIPMENT AS YOU NEED. MYSELF, I DON'T THINK IMPLOSION WILL WORK. IT'S JUST TOO COMPLICATED. IT'S TOO HARD TO GET A SYMMETRICAL SHOCK WAVE. PROVE ME WRONG. AND IF YOU DO, I'LL GIVE YOU A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THAT MISTAKE FOR THREE DAYS. OPPIE, I HAVE AN IDEA I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. WE KNOW IT MAY TAKE US TWO YEARS TO COME UP WITH THE BOMB, YEAH? WE DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE THAT LONG. WE STARTED LATE, LATER THAN GERMANY. SO, WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF TAKING THE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL WE ARE NOW PRODUCING AND DROP IT ON GERMANY... POISON THEIR FOOD SUPPLY. THIS WE COULD DO NOW. WHAT WOULD YOU USE, STRONTIUM-90? STRONTIUM-90. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. WHAT DO I THINK? I THINK YOU SHOULD START WORK RIGHT NOW. ON WHAT SCALE? I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD EVEN ATTEMPT A PLAN UNLESS WE CAN POISON FOOD SUFFICIENT TO KILL... HALF A MILLION PEOPLE. I HAVE TO GO TO CHICAGO TOMORROW AND SEE HOW THE PLUTONIUM'S COMING. THEN I'LL TAKE IT UP WITH WASHINGTON. NOT A WORD TO ANYONE, ENRICO. OPPIE, YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND CHICAGO? THERE THEY THINK THEY HAVE TO BUILD THE BOMB BECAUSE OF HITLER. HERE, EVERYONE WANTS TO BUILD IT. THAT'S BECAUSE I'M HERE AND SZILARD'S THERE. YOU SURPRISED HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME HERE WITH US? AH, LEO IS LEO. HE'S A CITY PERSON. WHAT WOULD HE DO WITHOUT HIS HOT PASTRAMI? A MILLION IDEAS A DAY, A THOUSAND OF THEM GOOD. LET HIM DRIVE EVERYONE IN CHICAGO CRAZY. [LAUGHS] SO, WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED TO SEE ME ABOUT, COLONEL? OH, I JUST THOUGHT WE SHOULD GET BETTER ACQUAINTED. SOCIALLY? PERSONALLY? SEXUALLY? [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] YOU'VE MADE MARTINIS BEFORE. ONCE OR TWICE. SO, WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU? KITTY? MRS. OPPENHEIMER? IT DEPENDS WHY YOU'RE HERE. WELL, I HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH SECURITY ON THIS PROJECT. AND NATURALLY, I'VE BEEN DEVELOPING CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT YOU... YOUR PAST, SOME OF YOUR ASSOCIATIONS, RELATIONSHIPS. AND I WONDERED IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT. IT'S PAST. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHO I AM NOW. NOW THE ONLY THINGS THAT MATTER TO ME ARE ROBERT AND HIS WORK. I UNDERSTAND THAT. THEN YOU DON'T MIND TALKING. IT'LL HELP TO SET OUR MINDS TO REST. WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE. THEN YOU WERE, VERY BRIEFLY, A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, IS THAT RIGHT? WHAT DID YOU DO FOR THEM? TYPED LETTERS, MIMEOED LEAFLETS... GENERAL OFFICE WORK. WHY THEM? PLEASE, I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND... IT WAS THE '30s. IT SEEMED TO A LOT OF US THAT COMMUNISM WAS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO FASCISM. THE DEMOCRACIES WEREN'T DOING A THING TO HELP IN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR. HITLER CAME IN ON THE SIDE OF FRANCO. WHO WAS GOING TO FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY IN SPAIN? AMERICA? BRITAIN? THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED. THE COMMUNISTS DID. THEN IT WAS THE DEPRESSION. THE PARTY CARED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE STARVING WHEN A LOT OF OTHERS DIDN'T. THE PARTY WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE LITTLE GUY. SO DID A LOT OF US. THAT'S NOT THAT HARD TO UNDERSTAND, IS IT? NO. YOU KNOW, IN A LOT OF PLACES, ESPECIALLY WHERE I WAS, IT WAS HARD TO MEET PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T IN THE PARTY OR AT LEAST ON THE EDGES. AROUND THE UNIVERSITIES. MM-HMM. INCLUDING OPPENHEIMER. HE WAS NEVER, NEVER A MEMBER OF THE PARTY. WHY IS THAT? OBVIOUSLY, HE CARED FOR THE SAME THINGS YOU... HE NEVER WAS THAT INVOLVED. IT WAS SO LONG AGO. IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. WE WERE DIFFERENT. NOW THE DEPRESSION'S OVER. THE WAR... WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER. ROBERT'S A PHYSICIST. HE'S A BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT SCIENTIST. HE'S AN AMERICAN. HE'D NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT THIS COUNTRY. HE WANTS TO WIN THE WAR. THAT'S ALL HE WANTS. AND HE CAN DO IT. THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. HE CAN DO IT. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] [SZILARD WHISTLING] LEO, WHAT'S THE QUESTION? HUH? YOU SOUND LIKE YOU ALREADY HAVE THE ANSWER. NO, I JUST GOT SOME VERY GOOD NEWS ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE FROM GERMANY. SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU TO CIVILIZATION, ROBERT? I MISS YOU. AW. SO, HOW'S THE PASTRAMI IN CHICAGO THESE DAYS? HOW ARE ALL YOUR LITTLE HOT DOGS IN LOS ALAMOS? [CHUCKLES] COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. NAH! NOBODY CAN THINK STRAIGHT IN A PLACE LIKE THAT. EVERYBODY WHO GOES THERE WILL GO CRAZY. YOU WATCH. HMM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M SEEING ARTHUR, CHECKING WHEN WE CAN EXPECT SOME CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE WORKER BEES. CHEERS. Trude: AFTER I GOT MY DEGREE IN BERLIN, YOU REMEMBER HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS TO ME. I REMEMBER. IT WAS TOO IMPORTANT, HUH? YEAH, WELL, I WOUND UP IN AUSTRIA IN PUBLIC HEALTH. I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU, THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF AUSTRIA HAS BEEN NOT TOO GOOD SINCE HITLER TOOK OVER. [ SIGHS] THEN ENGLAND, AND THEN HERE. AY-YI-YI-YI-YI. IT WASN'T SO BAD, LEO. I GUESS MY IMAGINATION GOT THE WORST OF ME, HUH? YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE ALWAYS FIGURED IN MY IMAGINATION, TRUDE. I HAVE? YEAH. MORE THAN YOU KNOW. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN MINE, TOO. YOU KNOW, I WAS AFRAID YOU'D BE MARRIED BY NOW OR HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. NO. LEO, PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME. Man: SUBJECT SZILARD IS OF JEWISH EXTRACTION. HE HAS A FONDNESS FOR DELICACIES AND FREQUENTLY EATS HIS BREAKFAST IN DRUGSTORES AND OTHER MEALS IN RESTAURANTS. HE WALKS A GREAT DEAL WHEN HE CANNOT SECURE A TAXI. HE USUALLY IS SHAVEN IN A BARBERSHOP. HE SPEAKS OCCASIONALLY IN A FOREIGN TONGUE AND ASSOCIATES MOSTLY WITH PEOPLE OF JEWISH EXTRACTION. HIS IS INCLINED TO BE RATHER ABSENTMINDED AND WILL START OUT A DOOR, TURN AROUND AND COME BACK, GO OUT ON A STREET WITHOUT HIS COAT OR HAT, AND FREQUENTLY LOOKS UP AND DOWN THE STREET AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW FOR SURE WHERE HE WANTED TO GO. [PROJECTOR STOPS] RECENTLY, SUBJECT HAS STARTED SHARING HIS HOTEL ROOM WITH THIS WOMAN, A REFUGEE FROM GERMANY VIA AUSTRIA, A DOCTOR NAMED GERTRUDE "TRUDE" WEISS. WHAT ELSE DO THEY TALK ABOUT? Dr. Weiss: TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON? Dr. Szilard: THIS WILL BE HARD FOR YOU TO BELIEVE, BUT I CANNOT SAY. YEAH, I KNOW. WHEN HAVE I EVER BEEN QUIET ABOUT ANYTHING? IT'S JUST THAT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE SO SECRET THESE DAYS. I DON'T HAVE TO KNOW ANYTHING. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. I JUST WANT TO BE NEAR YOU. DON'T TALK. COME HERE, LEO. COME HERE. [CHUCKLING] IF YOU KNEW HOW LONG I'VE PRAYED FOR THIS. THAT'S ALL? YES, SIR. FOR NOW. ALL RIGHT, KEEP ON HIM. WE'LL MAINTAIN SURVEILLANCE UNTIL WE'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT HE'S 100% RELIABLE. YES, SIR. [DOOR CLOSES] ALL RIGHT, NOW I'VE GOT SOMETHING. OPPENHEIMER'S BEEN HEAD OF THE MOST SECRET PROJECT OF THE WAR FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW. YOU STILL HAVEN'T ISSUED HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE. WHY NOT? WE DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. MAY WE TELL YOU WHY? WELL, I THINK YOU'D BETTER. SIR, HE'S JUST A REAL BAD RISK. HIS WIFE WAS A COMMUNIST. HE KNOWS COMMUNISTS. HE ASSOCIATES WITH THEM. HE'S HIRED A LOT OF THEM FROM THE COLLEGES TO WORK AT LOS ALAMOS... ALL LEFTIES. WHERE WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE GET OUR SCIENTISTS IF NOT FROM THE COLLEGES? HE BELONGS TO A LOT OF FRONT ORGANIZATIONS. HE WAS AT BERKELEY. EVERYBODY WHO WAS AT BERKELEY JOINED SOME SCREWBALL ORGANIZATION OR ANOTHER IN THE '30s. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ON HIM THAT'S NEW... SINCE HE'S JOINED THE PROJECT? WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT HIM RECENTLY? I WANT HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE ISSUED, AND I WANT IT ISSUED TODAY. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. SIR. IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO STOP LOOKING, DOES IT? Groves: WHO KNEW OPPENHEIMER WAS IN CHICAGO? I DIDN'T. NO OUTSIDE CONTACT. NO OUTSIDE CONTACT! WE HAD A FIRM AGREEMENT. Oppenheimer: YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK I VIOLATED IT. I HAD TO FIND OUT WHEN THE PLUTONIUM WAS GONNA BE READY. YOU'RE NOT TO SPEAK TO ANYONE OUTSIDE LOS ALAMOS! NOT EVEN COMPTON? HE'S THE HEAD OF THE LAB THERE. HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN TELL US WHEN TO EXPECT... YOU SPOKE TO LEO SZILARD, DIDN'T YOU? [SIGHS] BAD ENOUGH YOU ALL WANT TO TALK TO EACH OTHER DOWN HERE! [SIGHS] WHO ELSE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO CHICAGO? JUST ED. JUST ED... THE RESPONSIBLE MAN, THE CORPORATE EXECUTIVE WITH ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE, WHO SHOULD HAVE HAD BETTER JUDGMENT. GENERAL, NOW IT'S COME UP, YOU OUGHT TO KNOW... I THINK YOUR POLICY HERE IS DEAD WRONG. I THINK IT IS SLOWING US DOWN AND FOR NO GOOD REASON. WELL, ANYBODY WHO THINKS THAT SHOULD LEAVE. SCIENTISTS HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER. IF THEY CAN'T... OPPIE, WOULD YOU TELL HIM? UM, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING... DON'T DRAG HIM INTO IT, CONDON. IT'S MY POLICY, IT'S MY DECISION, AND IT'S FINAL. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING. YOU AGREE WITH ME. GENERAL, IF IT'S MY RESIGNATION YOU WANT, YOU CAN HAVE IT. ED, LISTEN. LET'S DON'T DO ANYTHING RASH. IF THESE ARE THE RULES, THEN WE CAN LEARN TO LIVE WITH THEM. [CHUCKLES] I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TRY. GOODBYE, OPPIE. GOOD LUCK. FORGET ABOUT CONDON. HE PROBABLY QUIT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE PROJECT WOULD FAIL. WELL, IT'S NOT GOING TO FAIL. [DOOR CLOSES] I WAS JUST TELLING THEM, OPPIE. IF THIS PIPE COLLAPSES EVENLY BUT DOESN'T GET TWISTED AND DEFORMED, THEN THAT'S SUCCESSFUL IMPLOSION. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. I DON'T KNOW. I WOULDN'T STAND SO CLOSE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE NOT... WE'RE NOT USING THAT MUCH EXPLOSIVE. I'M JUST SAYING, I WOULDN'T. ALL SET? GO AHEAD. [EXPLOSION] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! [SIREN WAILING] Man: YOU ALL RIGHT? I'VE SEEN BETTER-LOOKING PIPES. BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. WHY DON'T THEY DO IT OUT IN SOME FIELD SOMEWHERE? I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING. NO, NOT AT ALL. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. KITTY'S PROBABLY GOT SOME COFFEE READY. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME? NO, THANKS. SO, WHAT'S UP? WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WENT TO BERKELEY THIS WEEK. WAIT, WAIT, WHOA, WHOA. THAT WAS CLEARED. I HAD PERMISSION. THERE WAS SOMEBODY THAT I HAD TO... NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT, DOCTOR. YOU MENTIONED TO SECURITY THERE THEY OUGHT TO KEEP AN EYE ON A MAN NAMED CHARLES SATTERLEE, WORKS FOR UNIFIED OIL. I WONDERED WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT. YOU KNOW SATTERLEE PERSONALLY? UM, NO, SOMEBODY JUST MENTIONED HE KNEW SOMETHING. WHO MENTIONED IT? WAS A FRIEND OF YOURS? YOU DON'T MIND TELLING ME? WELL, I'VE... I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A GOOD DEAL, AND I FEEL I SHOULDN'T. I'D JUST BET DOLLARS TO DOUGHNUTS HE ISN'T PERSONALLY INVOLVED. I UNDERSTAND PERSONAL LOYALTY. BUT IN A CASE LIKE THIS... I'D REGARD IT AS A LOW TRICK TO INVOLVE SOMEONE WHEN I'D BET ANYTHING HE'S NOT INVOLVED WITH IT. OKAY, BOB, DON'T THINK IT'S THE LAST TIME I'M GONNA ASK YOU, BECAUSE IT'S NOT. Dr. Szilard: NO, NO. THE WAR SHOULD BE OVER BY NOW. IF WE HAD LISTENED TO US WHEN WE FIRST TOLD THEM, IF THAT IDIOT GROVES TREATED US LIKE GROWN MEN INSTEAD OF LIKE SPIES OR CHILDREN... [GROANS] MILITARY GENIUSES. BELIEVE ME, IN GERMANY, THEY'RE WORKING FIVE TIMES AS FAST AS WE ARE. AND ONE DAY VERY SOON, HITLER WILL DROP A BOMB ON US. LEO! YEAH, YEAH, ONE BOMB... RIGHT ON CHICAGO, STOP OUR WORK AND KILL EVERYONE INVOLVED. IT'S POSSIBLE BUT NOT PROBABLE. YOU KNOW HITLER. HE LOVES THE GRAND GESTURE, HUH? CHRISTMAS DAY WILL BE THE PERFECT TIME TO DO IT. BOOM. MERRY CHRISTMAS. NO, I DON'T WANT HIM FIRED. I WANT HIM ARRESTED. I WANT HIM LOCKED UP. I WANT LEO SZILARD INTERNED FOR AS LONG AS THE WAR LASTS. I CAN'T SIGN THAT, GENERAL. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING. THE MAN HAS ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF SECURITY WHATSOEVER. HE'S ALWAYS STIRRING THINGS UP, WORKING EVERYONE UP INTO A STATE OF REBELLION ALL THE TIME. ONE THING WE HAVE TO CONCERN OURSELVES WITH IS HOW FAR ALONG ARE THE GERMANS. WE'RE NOT GETTING HARD EVIDENCE THERE. GENERAL... ANY REASON YOU CAN'T TAKE OVER FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE, TOO? NO, SIR. GOOD. ANYTHING ELSE WE HAVE TO GO OVER? GENTLEMEN. Stimson: GENERAL. Man: I DO NOT GET THE FEELING GENERAL GROVES MUCH LIKES LEO SZILARD. [LAUGHTER] WHAT ELSE? THIS IDEA THAT OPPENHEIMER AND FERMI HAVE OF POISONING GERMANY'S FOOD SUPPLY. WHY DON'T WE JUST SIT ON THAT, HUH? OF COURSE. WHY DON'T WE? OH, GENTLEMEN, COME IN, COME IN, COME IN. DR... I'M SORRY, IS IT PRONOUNCED "GOOD-SCHMIDT"? "HOUSE-SCHMIDT." THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SIT DOWN. COLONEL PASH, NICE TO SEE YOU. GENTLEMEN, I'M ASSEMBLING AN INTELLIGENCE TEAM THAT WILL ENTER EUROPE WITH OUR INVASION FORCES. THIS TEAM WILL HAVE ONE MISSION... TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THE GERMANS KNOW ABOUT THE ATOMIC BOMB AND WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE. DOCTOR, LET ME ASK YOU. IF YOU WERE A MEMBER OF THIS TEAM, WHERE WOULD YOU START? WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK FOR? UH, WELL, SIR... WE ARE ALWAYS TOLD THAT ONLY A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE WORLD UNDERSTAND EINSTEIN. IF FOLLOWS THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THAT DOZEN MUST BE INCLUDED IN ANY ATOMIC-BOMB PROJECT, SINCE ITS CONSTRUCTION IS CLOSELY TIED UP WITH EINSTEIN'S THEORY. SO, I'D LOOK FOR WERNER HEISENBERG. YOU JUST MADE THE TEAM. COLONEL PASH, I WANT YOU TO BE THE MILITARY HEAD OF THIS TEAM. DOCTOR, I'D LIKE YOU TO BE SCIENTIFIC. WHEN OUR TROOPS ENTER EUROPE, I EXPECT YOU BOTH TO BE RIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE PARADE. GENERAL, I AM FLATTERED, OF COURSE, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY... DOCTOR, YOU'RE EUROPEAN. YOU SPEAK THE LANGUAGES. YOU KNOW THE SCIENTISTS. YOU EVEN KNOW ATOMIC PHYSICS. YOU'RE NOT WORKING ON OUR PROJECT, SO I CAN SPARE YOU. YOU DO WANT TO HELP YOUR ADOPTED COUNTRY, DON'T YOU, DOCTOR? YES, SIR, IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S... I ONLY WISH I WAS GOING WITH YOU. YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE MORE COMBAT IN THIS WAR THAN COLONEL NICHOLS AND I PUT TOGETHER. WE, ON THE OTHER HAND, MUST GO TO NEW YORK TO ENTERTAIN SOME BRITISHERS, WHO, IN THE SPIRIT OF ALLIED COOPERATION, HAVE VOLUNTEERED THEIR SERVICES IN AID OF THE BELEAGUERED COLONISTS. CAREFUL, LADS. REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THESE CHAPS GAVE US A TEA PARTY. [LAUGHTER] WHERE EXACTLY IN AMERICA WILL WE BE WORKING, GENERAL? UH, I'D RATHER NOT SAY. LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS. [LAUGHTER] DID I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY? ON WHAT PROBLEMS DO YOU IMAGINE WE COULD BE MOST HELPFUL, SIR? WE'LL TELL YOU WHATEVER YOU NEED TO KNOW WHENEVER YOU NEED TO KNOW IT. GENERAL, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE MET MY COLLEAGUE. [German accent] DR. KLAUS FUCHS. ARE YOU BRITISH, DR. FUCHS? OF SOMEWHAT RECENT VINTAGE. A REFUGEE FROM HITLER. WHAT DO YOU DO? I'M A PHYSICIST AND THEORETICIAN. WELL, WELCOME TO AMERICA. THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME. [STEAM WHISTLE BLOWING] I'M RAYMOND. KLAUS FUCHS. USE YOUR CODE NAME. DIDN'T THEY TEACH YOU? THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS I HAVE TO ASK YOU. ARE YOU HUNGRY? YEAH. LET'S GET SOMETHING TO EAT. MOSCOW HAS A LOT OF QUESTIONS. ♪ SILENT NIGHT ♪ ♪ HOLY NIGHT ♪ ♪ ALL IS CALM ♪ ♪ ALL IS BRIGHT ♪ Groves: SOUNDS NICE. Oppenheimer: I ALWAYS LIKED THIS TIME OF YEAR. A LITTLE FAMILY TIME. MY FATHER WAS AN ARMY CHAPLAIN. WE [CHUCKLES] WE WERE NEVER TOO MUCH ON HAVING FUN WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. HE WAS A PRETTY STRICT DADDY. BUT CHRISTMAS WAS SPECIAL. MERRY CHRISTMAS. MERRY CHRISTMAS. WELL, WE ALWAYS DID EVERYTHING AT CHRISTMAS... ALWAYS DID IT TOGETHER. DO YOU CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS? FOR THE CHILDREN... AN EXCUSE TO GIVE THEM PRESENTS. I WASN'T SURE, YOU BEING JEWISH AND ALL. YOU HAVE A LITTLE BOY. YEAH. YEAH, MY BOY'S AT WEST POINT... NATURALLY. [LAUGHS] HE'S STILL GOT THREE YEARS TO GO, THANK GOD. MY LITTLE GIRL... MY LITTLE GIRL IS NOT SO LITTLE ANYMORE. SHE'S ALL GROWN UP, JUST AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE CAN BE. I'M GONNA HAVE MY HANDS FULL WHEN THE BOYS DISCOVER HER. IS IT ROUGH ON YOUR FAMILY KNOWING YOU'RE 2,000 MILES AWAY ON CHRISTMAS? OH, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE I AM... WHERE I AM OR WHAT I'M DOING. MY WIFE IS ARMY ALL THE WAY, GOD BLESS HER. I MEAN, SHE KNOWS I DO SOMETHING, BUT SHE'D NEVER ASK WHAT. I'D NEVER TELL HER. MERRY CHRISTMAS. YOU MUST FIND THAT STRANGE. NO. [CHUCKLES] YOU KNOW WHY LEO SZILARD IS SUCH A PAIN IN THE REAR END? BECAUSE HE NEVER PLAYED BASEBALL WHEN HE WAS A KID. NO, IT'S TRUE. I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. HE NEVER LEARNED HOW TO COOPERATE, HOW TO BE PART OF A TEAM. SEE, THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU. YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY WE GET ALONG SO WELL. [CLEARS THROAT] ROBERT... DO YOU TRUST ME ENOUGH TO DO ME A FAVOR IF I SAID THAT IT WAS PERSONALLY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME? OF COURSE I DO. IT'S A TOUGH ONE. DON'T SAY YES IF YOU DON'T MEAN IT. I NEVER SAY ANYTHING I DON'T MEAN. ALL RIGHT. I NEED THE NAME, ROBERT. I NEED THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO TOLD YOU THAT SATTERLEE HAD A RUSSIAN CONTACT. NOW, POLITICS IS ONE THING. ESPIONAGE IS SOMETHING ELSE. WELL, ESPIONAGE... ARE YOU... IF YOU ORDER ME. BUT HE WAS JUST SAYING THAT HE KNEW SATTERLEE KNEW OF A WAY TO... THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME. CHEVALIER. HAAKON CHEVALIER. HOW DO YOU SPELL THAT? H-A-A-K-O-N C-H-E-V-A-L-I-E-R. WHERE WOULD I FIND HIM? BERKELEY. BUT I'D BET ANYTHING IN THE WORLD HE'S NOT INVOLVED. HE'S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN... WHAT DOES HE DO? IS HE A TEACHER? NOT PHYSICS? FRENCH. ROBERT. [CLEARS THROAT] [SIGHS] I KNOW THIS WAS HARD FOR YOU, ROBERT. BUT YOU TRUSTED ME, AND I APPRECIATE THAT. IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME. YOU DID THE RIGHT THING. ♪ OH, COME LET US ADORE HIM ♪ ♪ CHRIST THE LORD ♪ [CLICKING] [SIGHS] DAMN IT. DAMN IT. THAT METHOD WON'T WORK. WE CAN'T GET THE PLUTONIUM PURE ENOUGH. BESIDES, THERE'S TOO MUCH 240 IN IT. WELL, PAL, YOUR IMPLOSION THEORY'S LOOKING BETTER ALL THE TIME. EVERYBODY OUT. OUT! [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] USE MORE MEN. WORK FASTER. I NEVER WORKED WITH MORE THAN TWO OR THREE GUYS... START. [DOOR CLOSES] OPPIE, WE THINK THAT IMPLOSION CAN WORK. DOC HAS AN IDEA. IT'S REALLY RATHER SIMPLE, SIR... I MEAN, IN THEORY. IN PRACTICE, IT'LL BE FANTASTICALLY COMPLICATED. YOU SEE, WE HAVE THE EXPLOSIVE. AND IF YOU SURROUND IT WITH LENSES AND THEN DETONATE THEM ALL AT ONCE... YOU COULD THEORETICALLY GET SIMULTANEOUS DETONATION AND A SYMMETRICAL SHOCK WAVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK, ROBERT? [SIGHS] EXPLOSIVE LENSES, HUH? I THINK, UH, IT'S BRILLIANT. BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT WORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OH, IT'S LIKE STARTING OVER FROM SCRATCH, ISN'T IT? I'M AFRAID SO, ROBERT. WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED NEW TEAMS AND WORKSHOPS, MACHINING, MOLDING EQUIPMENT, AND HUNDREDS OF SKILLED, NEW MEN... UH, 400, 600... WITH HOUSING FOR THEIR FAMILIES. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS JUST DRESS REHEARSAL FOR THIS, WASN'T IT? AMATEUR HOUR. [CHUCKLES] ALL RIGHT. NIEDERMAYER OBVIOUSLY CAN'T HANDLE IT. WHO'S THE BEST THEORETICIAN TO WORK ON THIS? LET'S GET A LOOK. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] I HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE, SETH. I'M BRINGING IN 600 NEW MEN TO WORK ON IMPLOSION. WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE? KISTIAKOWSKY. LIKE THAT, HUH? SWELL, THANKS A LOT. SETH. SETH! [CHEERING] [HORNS HONKING] Man: MOVE IT OUT! MOVE IT OUT! FREEZE IT RIGHT THERE, HANS! [SPEAKING GERMAN] GOUDSMIT? SAMUEL GOUDSMIT? ANY EXPERIENCES WITH PLUTONIUM? NO, WE HAD NO FACTORIES TO MAKE URANIUM OR PLUTONIUM. WE HAD NO URANIUM BURNERS, NOTHING. WE NEVER STARTED. THE ABILITY WE HAD, THE MEN WE HAD, BUT THE RESOURCES... THOSE WE DID NOT. WHAT?! NO RESOURCES. WHY WAS THAT? REICHSMINISTER SPIER. WE TOLD HIM TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE READY TO MAKE THE BOMB. ALL HE WAS INTERESTED IN WAS ATOMIC ENERGY FOR POWER. YEAH, BECAUSE THAT WAS SO MUCH EASIER AND QUICKER. EVERYTHING HAD TO BE SO QUICK. DO YOU REMEMBER AN ORDER FROM HITLER IN 1942 BEARING ON THIS DECISION NOT TO PROCEED? YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. "START NO PROJECTS WHICH DOES NOT GUARANTEE WEAPONS READY FOR FIELD USE IN SIX WEEKS." SIX WEEKS. OUR FUHRER, THE GENIUS, SO SURE OF THE FINAL VICTORY. WHY BOTHER? I MEAN, WHO ARE WE FIGHTING? SHOPKEEPERS, FARMERS. YOU SEE, WE WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO NEEDED THE RESOURCES. THERE WERE OTHERS, AS WELL. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND. WE DID NOT ALL WANT TO COOPERATE. WE DID NOT WANT HITLER TO GET THE BOMB. I REMEMBER SCHUMANN, WHO SAID... A VERY BAD PHYSICIST. YEAH, BUT A GOOD TECHNICIAN. SCHUMANN SAID, "NEVER BREATH A WORD ABOUT ATOMIC BOMB "TO THE HIGHER-UPS. "IF THE FUHRER HEARS OF IT, HE WILL SAY, "'OH, WELL, HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED... SIX MONTHS? THEN, IF WE DO NOT HAVE ATOMIC BOMB IN SIX MONTHS..." WALK AWAY FOR A BIT, WILL YOU, PLEASE, SOLDIER? STILL, THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. THERE ARE NOT MAKING THE BOMB. THEY NEVER EVEN STARTED. ARE YOU SURE? THAT COULD BE A TRICK. WE HAVE PURCHASE ORDERS, EMPLOYMENT FIGURES, ACQUISITIONS FEES, EVERYTHING. THESE ARE THEIR TOP PEOPLE. YOU CAN SEE HERE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. AIN'T THAT GONNA MAKE THEM HAPPY DOWN ON THE FARM IN D.C.? YOU KNOW WHAT'S WONDERFUL? THE GERMANS HAVE NO ATOM BOMB. NOW WE WON'T HAVE TO USE OURS. SAM, YOU UNDERSTAND, IF WE'VE GOT A BOMB, WE'RE GONNA USE IT. Dr. Szilard: IT'S AMAZING... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. WE WERE SO SURE THE GERMANS WERE BUILDING THE BOMB. THAT THEY ARE NOT CHANGES EVERYTHING. WHY WERE WE BUILDING THE BOMB IN THE FIRST PLACE, HUH? FOR ONE REASON... TO PREVENT THEM FROM DROPPING THE BOMB ON US. WE WERE BUILDING THE BOMB SO IT WOULD NOT BE USED. YOU SEE... IF WE STARTED THIS TO PREVENT THEM FROM DROPPING THE BOMB ON US... AS MEN OF CONSCIENCE, WE MUST NOW PREVENT AMERICA FROM DROPPING THE BOMB ON SOMEONE ELSE. Groves: TWO YEARS. TWO YEARS AND $2 BILLION. 100,000 PEOPLE ON THE PAYROLL IN 16 STATES, AND THE WHOLE SHOOTING MATCH DEPENDS ON A COUPLE OF SCREWBALLS PLAYING IN THE SAND WITH A BIG FIRECRACKER. HECK, I'M THE LEAST PESSIMISTIC MAN YOU'LL EVER MEET. BUT AFTER ALL THE CORNERS I'VE CUT AND ALL THE TOES I'VE STEPPED ON, IF THIS THING DOESN'T WORK, I MIGHT JUST AS WELL BUY A HOUSE ON CAPITOL HILL. I'M GONNA SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE TESTIFYING BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. IF THIS THING WORKS, IF THAT PIPE STAYS IN ONE NICE, SMOOTH PIECE, SETH, SO WE CAN FINALLY BUILD THIS THING, I'M STILL GONNA GIVE YOU THAT BOTTLE OF WHISKEY. EVERYBODY READY? [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Groves: I'VE BEEN WITH THIS THING LONGER THAN ANYBODY... 2 1/2 YEARS NOW. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I FEEL, GENERAL. NOW, I REALIZE THE WAR AGAINST GERMANY MAY BE OVER BEFORE WE'RE READY TO GO, BUT I THINK JAPAN IS A BETTER TARGET FOR US ANYWAY, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. IF WE DID DROP THE GADGET ON GERMANY, SUPPOSE IT DIDN'T GO OFF? AND THE GERMANS... THE GERMANS MIGHT BE ABLE TO RECOVER IT. THEY COULD USE IT AS A MODEL TO BUILD THEIR OWN. THE JAPANESE COULD NEVER DO THAT. ALSO, THE JAPANESE USE WOOD AND PAPER IN THEIR BUILDING CONSTRUCTION. OUR BOMBS WOULD BE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AGAINST JAPAN. IN ANY CASE, WE NEED TO START PLANNING BOMBING OPERATIONS RIGHT AWAY. DON'T LIKE TO GET TOO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS. ANY REASON YOU CAN'T HANDLE THIS YOURSELF? NO, SIR. I'D BE GLAD TO. PROFESSOR, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I CANNOT TELL YOU, THINGS I CANNOT TELL TRUDE OR ANYONE. BUT YOU MUST KNOW, WE ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED WITH WHAT GERMANY MIGHT DO WITH US. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT THE UNITED STATES WILL DO WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. AND I'M NOT SPEAKING NOW ABOUT THE MORAL QUESTIONS, THE WAVE OF REVULSION AND HORROR THAT WILL SWEEP THE WORLD. ONLY THAT IF WE DROP THE BOMB, AN ARMS RACE WILL HAVE STARTED, AND WE WILL HAVE STARTED IT. IN A FEW YEARS, WE WILL BE AHEAD OF RUSSIA. THEN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROCKETS, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO DROP ATOMIC BOMBS ON CITIES FROM GREAT DISTANCES. IN THE EVENT OF A WAR, ALL OUR MAJOR CITIES WOULD VANISH WITHIN A FEW HOURS. YEAH, YEAH. [SIGHS] WE HAVE NO INFLUENCE WITH ROOSEVELT. WOULD YOU WRITE ANOTHER LETTER... TELL HIM THESE THINGS AND ASK HIM TO SEE ME? OF COURSE I WILL. THANK YOU. THE TEST TOWER'S GONNA BE DOWN WHERE GEORGE IS. WEATHER SHACK OVER THERE AND ALL THAT OTHER STUFF. WHERE IS THE CONTROL CENTER GOING TO BE? OVER THERE, ABOUT FIVE MILES. THAT SHOULD BE FAR ENOUGH, HUH? THAT'S WHERE YOU AND I ARE GONNA BE WATCHING FROM. SORRY I'M LATE. WE ARE JUST READING THE LETTER LEO AND EINSTEIN ARE GIVING TO ROOSEVELT. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON RADIO] NICE TO SEE YOU. Man: Just announced that President Roosevelt is dead. The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage. All is we know so far is that the President died... TRUDE, WHAT DID THEY SAY? HE'S DEAD. THEY JUST SAID THAT PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT IS DEAD. The President died of a cerebral hemorrhage. All we know so far is that the President died at Warm Springs in Georgia. THANKS. ADMIRAL LEAHY, YOU WERE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S CHIEF OF STAFF. I'D LIKE YOU TO SAY ON AS MINE. I WANT THE TRUTH. I WANT THE FACTS AT ALL TIMES. YOU HAVE MY PLEDGE, MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. YOU CAN COUNT ON ME. YES, SIR. [SIGHS] AIN'T THIS THE DAMNDEST AWFUL THING, JIMMY? THERE IS ONE FACT WE BOTH KNOW... THAT YOU'RE MORE QUALIFIED TO BE HERE THAN I AM. I WAS HIS VICE PRESIDENT. BUT YOU'RE THE MAN THE COUNTRY CALLED "ASSISTANT PRESIDENT." NOW I NEED YOU TO HELP ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT DEALING WITH STALIN AND THE RUSSIANS AND... [SIGHS] EVERYTHING ELSE. I WANT YOU TO BE MY SECRETARY OF STATE. WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME? YES, I WILL, HARRY. THAT'S FINE. I WILL. I'LL DO IT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. MR. PRESIDENT, THE FIRST THING YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW IS THAT WE'RE PERFECTING AN EXPLOSIVE GREAT ENOUGH TO DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD, WIPE OUT ENTIRE CITIES AND PEOPLE ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. AND THIS PUTS THE UNITED STATES INTO A POSITION OF DICTATING ITS OWN TERMS AT THE END OF THE WAR. Groves: LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS. I GO TO WASHINGTON FOR TWO WEEKS, AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AND TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE. IT'S SUNDAY, GENERAL, DAY OF REST. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF IT'S A SUNDAY. I WOULDN'T CARE IF WE WERE BURIED UNDER SIX FEET OF SNOW. BUT WE'LL HAVE A FULL CREW WORKING NEXT SUNDAY, AND EVERY SUNDAY UNTIL THIS TOWER IS FINISHED. WHEN YOU'RE READY TO TEST, WE'LL BE READY FOR YOU. I PROMISE YOU THAT. GOOD. ROBERT. DON'T YOU EVER WORRY THE WAR WILL BE OVER BEFORE THE BOMB IS READY TO DROP? BEFORE GENERAL GROVES GETS HERE, MR. PRESIDENT, I'VE PUT SOME THOUGHTS DOWN ON PAPER. JUST GO AHEAD AND TELL ME. IT'S ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MOST TERRIBLE WEAPON, BY WHICH MODERN CIVILIZATION COULD BE COMPLETELY DESTROYED. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE PROBLEM OF THE PROPER USE OF THIS WEAPON CAN BE SOLVED, WHY, WE'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE WORLD PEACE AND OUR CIVILIZATION. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SECRETARY. HAVE A SEAT. THANK YOU, SIR. SORRY I'M LATE. I THOUGHT IF ANYBODY SAW ME WALK IN HERE WITH THE SECRETARY, THEY MIGHT PUT 2 AND 2 TOGETHER. SECRETARY STIMSON WAS JUST CATCHING ME UP. YES, SIR. WELL, I'VE PREPARED A VERY DETAILED REPORT FOR YOU, COVERING EVERY ASPECT... HOW LONG IS IT? 24 PAGES. I DON'T LIKE TO READ LONG REPORTS. WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN TELL YOU THIS IN ANY MORE CONCISE LANGUAGE, MR. PRESIDENT. THIS IS A BIG PROJECT. MM-HMM. YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO KNOW. ALL RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT. SOMETIME IN EARLY JULY, OUR SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE WILL BE TESTING AN IMPLOSION WEAPON AT ALAMOGORDO, NEW MEXICO. AROUND AUGUST 1st, A URANIUM BOMB CALLED "LITTLE BOY" SHOULD BE READY. IT WON'T NEED ANY TESTING. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF SELECTING SPECIFIC TARGETS IN JAPAN RIGHT NOW. THAT'S THE STORY. ALL RIGHT. YOUR PRESENT COURSE IS SOUND. CONTINUE ON AS YOU'RE DOING NOW. YES, SIR. MR. PRESIDENT, THERE WILL BE VARIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HANDLING OF THE BOMB... POLITICAL, SCIENTIFIC, DIPLOMATIC. MAY I RESPECTFULLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU ASSEMBLE A COMMITTEE OF MILITARY AND SCIENTIFIC EXPERTS TO STUDY THESE MATTERS AND REPORT BACK TO YOU? THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. JUST MAKE SURE THAT SECRETARY OF STATE JIMMY BYRNES IS ON THAT COMMITTEE. YES, SIR. Pres. Truman: I ONLY WISH THAT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT HAD LIVED TO WITNESS THIS DAY. GENERAL EISENHOWER INFORMS ME THAT THE FORCES OF GERMANY HAVE SURRENDERED TO THE UNITED NATIONS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [HORNS HONKING] WHAT HAPPENS NOW, OPPIE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WHAT HAPPENS NOW?" HERE, WITH THE BOMB, WITH US, NOW THAT GERMANY SURRENDERED. WELL, THERE'S STILL A WAR ON, BOB. JAPAN HASN'T SURRENDERED. A BUNCH OF US HAVE BEEN... WELL, TO COME STRAIGHT OUT WITH IT, WE DON'T MUST LIKE THE IDEA OF DROPPING IT ON JAPAN, OPPIE. THEY'RE NO REAL THREAT TO US. THEY NEVER WERE AN ATOMIC THREAT. WE DON'T NEED THE BOMB TO BEAT JAPAN. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. WE'RE SCIENTISTS, NOT SOLDIERS. I DO KNOW THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. ONE I'VE BEEN GIVING SOME REAL THOUGHT TO IS A DEMONSTRATION. INVITE THE JAPANESE TO SEE THE TEST. LET THEM SEE WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF THEY DON'T SURRENDER. LOOK, NOBODY KNOWS THIS YET, BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST PUT TOGETHER A COMMITTEE TO ADVISE HIM ON THE USE OF THE BOMB, AND I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SERVE. I PROMISE YOU THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS WE EXPLORE IN DEPTH. AND EVEN THOUGH I CANNOT GUARANTEE THE RESULTS, WELL, YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL, AND YOU KNOW WE'LL BE HEARD. FAIR ENOUGH? Groves: SURE, I KNOW SOME OF THEM DON'T WANT TO USE THE BOMB AGAINST JAPAN. SAME THING AS CHICAGO. IT'S WORSE IN CHICAGO. [SIGHS] NOW, LISTEN, ROBERT... I'M NOT A PREJUDICED MAN. YOU KNOW THAT. I'VE PUT A LOT OF JEWS INTO POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY ON THIS PROJECT, AS YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE, AND THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING NOISE ABOUT NOT USING THE BOMB AGAINST JAPAN ARE JEWS WHO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY TO ESCAPE HITLER'S PERSECUTION. TO THEM, HITLER IS THE ONE REAL ENEMY OF THIS WAR. WELL, NOW HITLER'S DEAD. GERMANY'S DESTROYED. AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED, THEIR WAR IS OVER. ROBERT... OUR WAR IS NOT OVER. AH, COLONEL TIBBETS. HAVE YOU MET CAPTAIN PARSONS? PAUL TIBBETS. DEKE PARSONS, HEAD ORDNANCE UNIT. I'VE BEEN TOLD I'LL BE FLYING THE PLANE WITH THE BOMB. I'LL BE GOING WITH YOU. I'LL BE ARMING THE BOMB. GOOD. THEN IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, CAPTAIN, I CAN BLAME YOU. ANYTHING GOES WRONG, COLONEL, NEITHER OF US WILL BE AROUND TO BE BLAMED. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, LET'S GET STARTED. WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO. YOU'RE HERE TO HELP ME SELECT THE BEST TARGET CITIES IN JAPAN FOR THE MISSION. SPECIFICALLY I WANT TO LOOK AT KYOTO, HIROSHIMA, NAGASAKI, AND YOKOHAMA. MATT CONNELLY WAS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS AT FIRST, 'CAUSE THIS APPOINTMENT CAME THROUGH KANSAS CITY. BUT WHEN YOU HAD THIS LETTER FROM EINSTEIN... ALL RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO KNOW YOUR CONCERNS, GENTLEMEN. WE DO NOT KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT'S PLANS FOR USE OF THE ATOMIC BOMBS, MR BYRNES. AND WE WISH TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU. POLICY ISN'T THE SCIENTISTS' BUSINESS. WELL, IN THIS RESPECT IT IS, SIR. WE KNOW THE FACTS ON WHICH THIS POLICY HAS TO BE BASED. WE KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT RUSSIA MIGHT BECOME AN ATOMIC POWER AND SOON, ESPECIALLY IF WE DROP THE BOMB. GENERAL GROVES TELLS ME IT'LL BE 20 YEARS BEFORE THE RUSSIANS HAVE THE BOMB. YEAH? WE FEEL THREE OR FOUR YEARS. THREE OR FOUR? UH-HUH. GROVES TELLS ME THERE'S NO URANIUM IN RUSSIA. SIT DOWN. THERE'S CERTAINLY THERE'S URANIUM IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA TO WHICH THE RUSSIANS HAVE ACCESS, AND RUSSIA IS A VAST COUNTRY. I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SAY IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY THERE IS NO URANIUM IN RUSSIA. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING? I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE TO DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE BOMB BY TESTING IT OR USING IT BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT HAS DECIDED HOW TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION AFTER THE WAR. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT. OF COURSE, YOU DON'T SHOW PEOPLE IT'LL WORK. WE'VE SPENT $2 BILLION DEVELOPING THIS BOMB. CONGRESS IS GONNA WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE GOT FOR ALL THAT MONEY. AND THERE'S ANOTHER PRETTY GOOD REASON FOR FINDING OUT WHAT THE BOMB CAN DO, ISN'T THERE? YOU'RE BOTH FROM HUNGARY, AREN'T YOU? YEAH, ORIGINALLY. AREN'T YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE RUSSIANS BEING IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY? I SURE AM. THEY'VE MOVED TROOPS INTO HUNGARY, ROMANIA. IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO PERSUADE THEM TO GET THEIR TROOPS OUT OF THERE. WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THEY MIGHT BE MORE MANAGEABLE IF THEY KNOW WHAT AMERICA'S GOT. MANAGEABLE, HUH? SETTING OFF AN ATOMIC BOMB MIGHT IMPRESS THEM A LITTLE. I DON'T THINK IT WILL MAKE THEM MORE MANAGEABLE, MR. BYRNES. I THINK IT WILL MAKE THEM BUILD ATOMIC BOMBS THEMSELVES. SEE, I AM LESS CONCERNED ABOUT HUNGARY RIGHT NOW THAN I AM ABOUT STARTING AN ARMS RACE THAT MIGHT END WITH BOTH AMERICA AND RUSSIA DESTROYED. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] [HORN HONKING] [HORN HONKS] ROBERT? ROBERT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN WASHINGTON? A MEETING. YOU? I... I CAME TO SEE JAMES BYRNES ABOUT NOT DROPPING THE BOMB. I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SAVED MY BREATH. THE ATOMIC BOMB IS SHIT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? WELL, IT'S A WEAPON THAT HAS NO MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE. IT WILL MAKE A BANG, A VERY BIG BANG, BUT IT'S A WEAPON THAT HAS NO USE IN WAR. WHAT IS ITS USE, THEN... DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL? NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RUSSIANS, BUT IF WE TELL THEM WHAT WE INTEND TO DO... AND THEN DROP THE BOMB ON JAPAN, DON'T YOU THINK THEY'LL GET THE POINT? OH, YEAH, I THINK THEY WILL GET THE POINT VERY WELL. WELL, WE'LL SEE. NOTHING'S DECIDED YET. SO? SO... HE WILL PLAY BALL WITH THEM. HE WILL NOT OPPOSE THE BOMB HE WORKED SO HARD TO MAKE. HE MUST PROVE TO THEM HE IS A PATRIOT... AS GOOD AN AMERICAN AS ANY OF THEM. GENTLEMEN, IN OUR HANDS, WE EXPECT SOON TO HAVE A WEAPON OF WHOLLY UNPRECEDENTED DESTRUCTIVE POWER. NOW, BEFORE WE BEGIN, LET ME SAY THAT IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS PROJECT NOT BE CONSIDERED SIMPLY IN TERMS OF MILITARY WEAPONS, BUT AS A NEW RELATIONSHIP OF MAN TO THE UNIVERSE. IT IS THIS COMMITTEE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO RECOMMEND ACTION THAT MAY TURN THE COURSE OF CIVILIZATION. GENERAL MARSHALL, WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING? I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE THE ADVANCES IN THIS PROJECT HAVE BEEN FOSTERED BY THE NEEDS OF THE WAR, THE IMPLICATIONS GO FAR BEYOND THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT WAR. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED MUST BE CONTROLLED TO MAKE IT AN ASSURANCE OF FUTURE PEACE RATHER THAN A MENACE TO CIVILIZATION. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. AND THAT BEING SAID, IT IS OUR HIGH TASK TO BRING THIS WAR TO A PROMPT AND SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION. DR. OPPENHEIMER, PERHAPS YOU'LL TELL US THE STATUS OF THE BOMB. WE ARE PREPARING THE TESTS FOR THE PLUTONIUM BOMB NOW. IF IT WORKS, YOU'LL HAVE A BOMB READY FOR USE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS... SAY, BY AUGUST 1st. URANIUM. OH, THE URANIUM BOMB WILL BE READY AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. WELL, HOW POWERFUL WILL THIS BOMB BE? WE THINK BETWEEN 2,000 AND 20,000 TONS OF TNT. WHAT DOES YOUR RESEARCH SHOW FOR THE FUTURE? EDWARD TELLER IS AT LOS ALAMOS NOW, WORKING ON THE SUPERBOMB. WITH HYDROGEN, ONE BOMB CAN EQUAL 10 MILLION TO 100 MILLION TONS OF TNT. HOW MUCH? 100 MILLION TONS OF TNT IN ONE BOMB? HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO... ANYTHING? ALL SIDES TOGETHER IN THIS WAR WILL USE APPROXIMATELY THE EQUIVALENT OF 3 MILLION TONS OVERALL. HOW LONG WILL THE HYDROGEN BOMB TAKE TO DEVELOP? A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS. HOW LONG BEFORE RUSSIA GETS THE BOMB? TWO TO FIVE YEARS. I THINK SIX. 20. WELL, NOW, YOU CAN'T CONCEAL SECRETS OF NATURE, GENERAL. THE RUSSIANS ARE GOING TO KNOW HOW NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. THAT MAY NOT BE THE COMPLETE NEGATIVE IT APPEARS, GENTLEMEN. RUSSIA'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY FRIENDLY TO SCIENCE. JUST FOR A THOUGHT, MAYBE WE COULD OPEN UP THIS SUBJECT WITH THEM OURSELVES IN A TENTATIVE WAY, ON VERY GENERAL TERMS, WITHOUT GIVING THEM ANY DETAILS, OF COURSE. ASK IF THEY'D MAYBE COOPERATE WITH US ON SOME SORT OF INTERNATIONAL CONTROLS, BEFORE WE USE THE BOMB. IT'S A BEGINNING. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD PREJUDGE RUSSIA ON THIS. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHARGES BACK AND FORTH ABOUT OUR RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS. FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE, MOST OF THESE CHARGES AGAINST RUSSIA ARE UNFOUNDED. THEY'VE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE WITH US FIGHTING THE WAR. WHEN THEY SEEM NOT TO WANT TO COOPERATE, IT COMES FROM A NEED TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN SECURITY. I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO INVITE, SAY, TWO PROMINENT RUSSIAN SCIENTISTS TO WITNESS THE TEST. I THINK THAT'S AN EXTREMELY GOOD IDEA. NO. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. STALIN WOULD WANT TO GET INTO A PARTNERSHIP WITH US. WE DON'T WANT THAT. WE'LL JUST PUSH AHEAD AS FAST AS POSSIBLE WITH OUR OWN PRODUCTION AND RESEARCH TO MAKE CERTAIN WE STAY AHEAD, AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE'LL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BETTER OUR POLITICAL RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA. THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM DR. OPPENHEIMER WHAT HE EXPECTS WHEN THE BOMB IS DROPPED ON JAPAN. WELL, A BRILLIANT LIGHT WILL RISE 10,000 TO 20,000 FEET, PROBABLY KILL 20,000 PEOPLE. THE RADIATION WILL BE DANGEROUS TO LIFE FOR ABOUT 2/3 OF A MILE. AND WHAT KIND OF TARGET WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE? I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT A MILITARY TARGET... SAY A LARGE NAVAL INSTALLATION WITH NO CIVILIANS, IF POSSIBLE. COULD WE PRECEDE THAT WITH A WARNING? I THINK WE SHOULD. THE PROBLEM WITH A WARNING IS THAT YOU THROW AWAY THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE AND THE SHOCK VALUE... ONE OF THE BIGGEST PARTS OF THIS THING. MR. SECRETARY, WOULD YOU OBLIGE ME BY TAKING A SHORT BREAK HERE? OH, YES, YES, OF COURSE. THE FACILITIES ARE THROUGH THERE FOR THOSE WHO NEED THEM, AND WE HAVE SOME COFFEE AND DOUGHNUTS. WHAT ABOUT THE DEMONSTRATION IDEA... SHOWING THE JAPANESE WHAT WE'VE GOT BEFORE WE DROP IT? I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, ERNEST. IT WON'T WORK. WHY NOT? JUST TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH IT. WHAT IF IT'S A DUD? WE DON'T KNOW THE BOMB WILL GO OFF. AS WELL AS WE KNOW ANYTHING. AND IF IT DOESN'T, THEN THEY HAVE THE THING. I MEAN, HOW WOULD YOU SET A DEMONSTRATION UP? THE JAPANESE WOULD PROBABLY THINK IT'S A TRICK... WON'T EVEN COME. WHAT DO YOU DO, BLOW UP SOME BUILDINGS OR TREES? TALKING ABOUT A DEMONSTRATION? WELL, THAT'S FINE. CERTAINLY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL DISCUSS, BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THERE ARE BOYS DYING OUT THERE EVERY DAY. TELL ME, ERNEST... YOUR FRIENDS THERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO AND BERKELEY, LIKE MR. SZILARD AND OTHERS, DO THEY HAVE ANY RELATIVES FIGHTING IN THE PACIFIC? OR CAN THEY AFFORD TO BE SOFT? THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE COFFEE, I WONDER IF YOU'D BRING IT BACK TO THE TABLE, PLEASE? DR. OPPENHEIMER, BEFORE WE BROKE, YOU EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT AN ATOMIC BOMB WOULD KILL 20,000 PEOPLE. WELL, THAT'S NO WORSE THAN A CONVENTIONAL FIRE-BOMB RAID, IS IT? NOW, THAT WOULD BE A BOMB DROPPED ON A CITY. I TAKE IT THAT'S THE KIND OF TARGET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE? YES. I'D BE INTERESTED IN DR. OPPENHEIMER'S VIEWS ON A POSSIBLE PRIOR DEMONSTRATION OF THE BOMB AS A WARNING TO THE JAPANESE, AN INDUCEMENT TO THEM TO SURRENDER BEFORE WE ACTUALLY USE IT. MR. BYRNES, WE'RE SCIENTISTS. WE POSSESS NO CLAIM TO SPECIAL COMPETENCE IN SOLVING POLITICAL, SOCIAL, OR MILITARY PROBLEMS. AND WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE AMONG OURSELVES. BUT IT IS MY BELIEF THE DEMONSTRATION HAS RISKS. COULD BE A DUD. IT WOULD DISSIPATE THE SHOCK VALUE, AND IT WOULD TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME TO SET UP. I JUST DON'T FAVOR THAT IDEA. HOW ABOUT AT LEAST GIVING THE JAPANESE A WARNING? I ASSUME YOU'RE NOT FLYING THE AIRCRAFT, ARE YOU, SIR? NO. WHAT CONCERNS ME IS IF THE JAPANESE KNOW IN ADVANCE, THEY'LL JUST MOVE AMERICAN BOYS, PRISONERS OF WAR, INTO ALL THEIR CITIES. Groves: WITH RESPECT, GENTLEMEN, THE JAPANESE PEOPLE, MILITARY OR CIVILIAN, ARE NOT GONNA BE WARNED. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE DEMONSTRATED TO. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE NEGOTIATED INTO SURRENDER OR ANYTHING LIKE IT. NOW, LET'S NOT FORGET SAIPAN HERE. THE BATTLE FOR SAIPAN WAS WON, AND 22,000 JAPANESE CIVILIANS KILLED THEMSELVES... CIVILIANS... THROWING THEMSELVES OFF OF CLIFFS, HOLDING THEIR CHILDREN IN THEIR ARMS RATHER THAN SURRENDERING. THE JAPANESE ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE SHOCKED INTO QUITTING THIS WAR. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE... CRUSHED. WELL, WITH THAT IN MIND, AND BEARING IN MIND THAT WE WANT TO AVOID MOUNTING AN INVASION OF JAPAN IN WHICH A HALF-MILLION TO A MILLION AMERICAN LIVES COULD BE LOST, WHAT KIND OF CITY, WHAT KIND OF TARGET DO WE WANT TO RECOMMEND? WHERE DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT MILLION FIGURE, HENRY? IS THAT A CIVILIAN ESTIMATE? YES. WELL, IT SOUNDED AWFULLY HIGH TO ME. LET ME WORK ON IT, GET YOU A MILITARY ESTIMATE. ALL RIGHT, VERY WELL. I WAS IMPRESSED BY SOMETHING DR. OPPENHEIMER AND GENERAL GROVES SAID ABOUT SHOCK VALUE. I THINK SHOCK VALUE WILL END THIS WAR QUICKLY. I THINK WE OUGHT TO USE THE BOMB ON A VITAL WAR PLAN, ONE THAT EMPLOYS A LARGE NUMBER OF WORKERS AND IS CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY THEIR HOUSES. SOUNDS RIGHT TO ME. Stimson: ANYONE? Oppenheimer: I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER ATTACKING SEVERAL CITIES AT ONCE. WHY JUST ONE? THEN I TAKE IT WE'RE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT... THAT WE CAN'T GIVE JAPAN ANY WARNING, THAT WE SHOULD NOT CONCENTRATE ON A CIVILIAN AREA, AND THAT WE SHOULD SEEK TO MAKE A PROFOUND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPRESSION ON AS MANY OF THE INHABITANTS AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S OUR REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT. WHAT DO WE SAY TO SZILARD? OF COURSE THEY CAN GIVE A WARNING IF THEY WANT. OF COURSE THEY CAN HAVE A DEMONSTRATION. WHAT? THEY CAN DROP IT IN THE WOODS NEAR A CITY. THEY CAN WARN THE JAPANESE TO CLEAR OUT THE CITY AND THEN DROP IT. WHAT? THEY CAN BLOW UP MOUNT FUJI IF THEY WANT. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT! THEY WANT TO DROP THE BOMB TO SHOW EVERYONE WHAT THEY DID, TO GET THEIR $2 BILLION WORTH, TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR IT. [INDISTINCT TALKING] LISTEN, LISTEN! WE ARE NOT IN THE ARMY. WE ARE THE MEN WHO CONCEIVED THIS BOMB AND DESIGNED IT AND BUILT IT. AND BEFORE GOD AND THE WORLD, WE HAVE THE DUTY TO SEE THAT IT IS USED WISELY. WE WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. I-I HAVE A PETITION TO PRESIDENT TRUMAN... STATING THAT WE ARE SACRIFICING EVERYTHING GOOD AND MORAL THAT WE BELIEVE IN IF WE DROP THIS BOMB ON PEOPLE. WHO WILL SIGN THIS PETITION WITH ME? I WILL. GOOD. GOOD. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] THANK YOU. I'M SENDING A COPY TO LOS ALAMOS, AS WELL, AND ASK THEM TO SIGN. THOUGH I'M SURE MANY OF THE BOYS THERE WILL BE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT KIND OF THING A MORAL ISSUE IS. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, EDWARD, I DON'T THINK A WHOLE LOT OF SCIENTISTS LIKE SZILARD WHO USE THEIR PRESTIGE FOR POLITICAL PRONOUNCEMENTS. TELLER, DON'T BOTHER ME WITH YOUR CONSCIENTIOUS SCRUPLES. THIS IS SUPERB PHYSICS. SO, TELL ME, OPPIE. I NEED YOUR ADVICE. YOU WOULDN'T SIGN? I'VE JUST COME BACK FROM WASHINGTON. I WISH YOU'D BEEN THERE WITH ME. YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THE DEEP CONCERN, THE THOROUGHNESS, THE WISDOM THESE QUESTIONS ARE BEING HANDLED WITH BACK THERE. AND, OF COURSE, THEY HAVE INFORMATION WE DON'T. WITHOUT THE BOMB, THEY'D HAVE TO INVADE JAPAN. A MILLION AMERICAN CASUALTIES. OUR FATE IS IN THE HANDS OF THE BEST AND MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MEN IN THIS NATION. BEFORE YOU LEAVE, GENERAL, IS YOUR REPORT ON THE TARGET CITIES READY? YES, SIR, I'LL BE SHOWING IT TO GENERAL MARSHALL FOR HIS APPROVAL FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. YES, WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE IT. WELL, OF COURSE, SIR. WELL, MY IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR IS GENERAL MARSHALL, AND THIS IS A MILITARY OPERATIONAL REPORT, MR. SECRETARY. YES, AND I'M THE SECRETARY OF WAR. YOUR REPORT IS ALL FINISHED, ISN'T IT? WELL, I'D LIKE TO GO OVER IT ONE MORE TIME AND MAKE SURE I'VE GOT IT JUST RIGHT. YEAH, WELL, I'D LIKE TO SEE IT NOW. I HAVEN'T GOT THE REPORT WITH ME, MR. SECRETARY. IT'S ACROSS THE RIVER. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO GET IT. I HAVE ALL DAY. THERE'S THE TELEPHONE. YOU CAN CALL THEM UP AND TELL THEM TO BRING IT RIGHT OVER. THIS IS A QUESTION I'M SETTLING MYSELF. WHAT ARE THE TARGETS? THE PRIMARY IS KYOTO. I WILL NOT APPROVE KYOTO. SIR, KYOTO IS PERFECT FOR US. WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT YET. WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF THE BOMB MUCH MORE ACCURATELY. I'VE BEEN TO KYOTO. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CITY. HAS DEEP RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE JAPANESE... A VERY ANCIENT CULTURE. SIR, WHEN YOU READ THE DESCRIPTION AS TO WHY KYOTO IS SUCH A DESIRABLE MILITARY TARGET FOR US, I'M SURE YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. I MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT. I DON'T WANT KYOTO BOMBED. REPORT'S ON ITS WAY OVER, SIR. WELL, I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. YOU NEED ME FOR ANYTHING ELSE? NO. NO, THANK YOU. IF YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE REPORT WITH ME, MR. SECRETARY, I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE. VERY WELL. THANK YOU. THE MILITARY ARE COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY CIVILIANS. IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DESIGNATING TARGETS! NOW, HOW DO WE END IT? SIR, IF SEA AND AIR POWER DON'T DO IT BY NOVEMBER, WE THINK WE'LL HAVE TO INVADE JAPAN. NOW, HOW EXPENSIVE WOULD THAT BE? HOW MANY CASUALTIES? COULD BE AS MANY AS A MILLION. THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE AN INVASION OF JAPAN SHOULD EXCEED OUR INVASION OF THE PHILIPPINES. HOW MANY WAS THAT? FIRST MONTH, 31,000 CASUALTIES, 7,000 DEAD. WHAT IF IT'S ANOTHER OKINAWA? THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF, SIR, MORE THAN THE PHILIPPINES. OKINAWA IS A SMALL ISLAND. WE LOST 10,000 DEAD, 40,000 WOUNDED. THAT'S WHAT I THINK WILL HAPPEN, ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE, IF WE HAVE TO INVADE JAPAN. [INDISTINCT TALKING] I WANT TO END THIS WAR QUICKLY. I WANT TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. I DON'T WANT ANOTHER OKINAWA. ANYBODY THINK THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INVASION? McCloy: WELL, I THINK YOU'VE GOT AN ALTERNATIVE. I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE OUR HEADS EXAMINED IF WE DON'T OFFER THEM HONORABLE SURRENDER TERMS, NEGOTIATE A PEACE. WHY DO WE HAVE TO INVADE THEM? WELL, NOW, THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT. Bart: WELL, YES, SIR. FOR GOD'S SAKE, LET'S NOT ORGANIZE AN ARMY TO GO INTO JAPAN, KILL A MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S RIDICULOUS. YES, THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD IN STOCK, AND THEIR FUEL RESERVES ARE PRACTICALLY EXHAUSTED ALREADY. IF WE MINE ALL THEIR HARBORS, ISOLATE THEM FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD... Man #2: BLOCKADING IS A COWARDLY ACT. IT'S NOT WORTHY OF THE AIR FORCE. WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK WE CAN GIVE THEM SURRENDER TERMS THEY'LL ACCEPT THAT WILL LEAVE US SAFE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE WITH NO INVASION. NOW, THAT INTERESTS ME. I'M VERY GLAD THE SUBJECT CAME UP. DON'T YOU THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO TELL THE JAPANESE THAT WE HAVE THE ATOMIC BOMB AND THAT WE PLAN TO USE IT? I SURE DON'T. WHAT IF IT DOESN'T GO OFF? WHAT HAPPENS TO AMERICAN PRESTIGE? I THINK THE MORAL POSITION THAT WE HAVE WOULD TRANSCEND ANY TEMPORARY DISADVANTAGE THAT MIGHT FOLLOW A DUD. YOU DO? NOT ME. CAN'T WE AT LEAST ISSUE THEM A WARNING... APPROACH THEM WITH TERMS OF PEACE? NO, NO, NO. EVERYTHING I KNOW TELLS ME THE JAP WON'T QUIT. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE BEATEN. THEY'LL FIGHT UNTIL THEY EAT STONES. MR. PRESIDENT, WHY'D WE BUILD THIS BOMB IF NOT TO USE IT? WHY'D WE SPEND 3 YEARS AND $2 BILLION? WHETHER WE INVADE OR NOT, 7,000 LIVES OR A MILLION, LET'S END THIS THING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH NO MORE AMERICAN DEATHS. WHY WAIT THREE MONTHS OR THREE DAYS OR THREE MINUTES FOR THEM TO SURRENDER? OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO SAVE AMERICAN BOYS' LIVES. THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON RIGHT THERE. BUT THERE'S OTHER WAYS. WELL, IF YOU DON'T MENTION THE BOMB TO THE JAPANESE, AT LEAST IN GENERAL TERMS EXPLAIN TO THEM ITS CAPACITY... SOMETHING THAT IN ONE BLOW, COULD WIPE OUT A CITY. SURELY, THEY'LL UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT'S INTERESTING, McCLOY. YOU GIVE THAT FURTHER THOUGHT, RIGHT? GIVE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH TO MY SECRETARY OF STATE HERE. THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN. VERY INFORMATIVE. GOOD LUCK AT POTSDAM, MR. PRESIDENT. THANK YOU, GENERAL. GOOD LUCK, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. GOOD LUCK, SIR. I'VE BEEN LISTENING FOR THREE WEEKS... HOW IT COST $2 BILLION, IT'S GONNA TERRIFY THE RUSSIANS, SAVE ALL THESE AMERICAN LIVES. DO YOU THINK IT WOULD MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IF THEY WERE WHITE INSTEAD OF YELLOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK, JIMMY? I THINK STALIN MEANS TO STAY IN EASTERN EUROPE, AND AT YALTA, HE PROMISED ROOSEVELT TO COME INTO THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN THREE MONTHS AFTER GERMANY SURRENDERED. ONLY NOW, WE DON'T WANT HIM IN. ONCE HE GETS INTO JAPAN, HOW DO WE GET HIM OUT? IT'LL BE JUST LIKE EUROPE. WE WANT TO SEND HIM A MESSAGE. I ONLY HOPE THIS BOMB TEST COMES OFF BEFORE YOU AND JOE MEET IN POTSDAM. IF IT DOES, I CERTAINLY HAVE A HAMMER ON THOSE BOYS. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] COME. MR. PRESIDENT, MAY I SEE YOU FOR A MOMENT, SIR? WHY, CERTAINLY, BART. WHAT IS IT? SIR, THE STAKES ARE SO TREMENDOUS. WE JUST HAVE TO GIVE THE JAPANESE TWO OR THREE DAYS' WARNING. WE'RE A GREAT HUMANITARIAN NATION, MR. PRESIDENT. OUR PEOPLE BELIEVE IN FAIR PLAY. THE NAVY KNOWS THE JAPANESE ARE LICKED. THE ARMY JUST WANTS TO BE IN ON THE KILL. IF WE LET THE JAPANESE KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT, IF WE AT LEAST TRY. ALL THESE QUESTIONS... THEY'VE ALL RECEIVED VERY CAREFUL STUDY. YOU'VE MADE UP YOUR MINDS, THEN. SIR, I FIND MYSELF IN SUCH STRONG DISAGREEMENT ABOUT DROPPING THE BOMB, ESPECIALLY WITHOUT GIVING ANY WARNING, THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RESIGN FROM THE COMMITTEE. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF IT. I'M ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO RESIGN AS UNDERSECRETARY OF THE NAVY, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, MR. PRESIDENT. LISTEN, SAM, CHECK THAT HOIST FOR ME, WILL YOU? I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE WHEN THE GEIGER GETS HERE. SURE THING, KEN. GET OFF. [TELEPHONE RINGS] YES, KEN? YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. WE'LL GET STARTED. WE GO IF THE WEATHER HOLDS. GET GOING WITH THE ASSEMBLY. I'LL GET THE PLUTONIUM. WILL YOU CALL ME IF IT'S A SUCCESS? YES, YES, OF COURSE. ROBERT... WHAT'S THIS? IT'S A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER. I FOUND IT IN THE BACKYARD. UH, I'LL HAVE TO USE CODE. I'LL SAY... "YOU CAN CHANGE THE SHEETS." NOW, JUST BEFORE YOU... I KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND ANY OF YOU WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET CARELESS AND FISSION STARTS HERE. OPPIE, WHY DON'T YOU WAIT OUTSIDE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? UNTIL THE ASSEMBLY'S DONE. FINE. FINE. OKAY, EASY DOES IT, GUYS. TAKE HER SLOWLY. [COUGHING] EASY DOES IT. LET'S GO. OKAY, LET'S GO! LET'S PUT IT IN THE TENT. WE'LL ATTEMPT THE CORE THERE. I DON'T WANT ANY SAND MUCKING UP THE WORKS. I DON'T LIKE THIS WIND. NO. DON'T KNOW HOW FAR IT'LL BLOW THE FALLOUT. THEY'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT AN ATTEMPT NOW. GOD, THIS WEATHER, HUH? I HATE IT. HATE IT. GET THE HOIST READY. EASY, EASY. SLOWLY. SLOWLY. SLOWLY. EASY. CAREFUL. OVER THE MIDDLE. KEEP COMING, SLOWLY. GENTLY. MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE. MORE, PLEASE. GENTLY. OH. SLOW. SLOWLY. MORE, A LITTLE MORE. GOD ALMIGHTY, OPPIE, YOU OUGHT TO WAIT OUTSIDE. PLEASE. WHEN DOES GROVES GET HERE? WHO CARES? IT'S STUCK. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IT'S STUCK. OF COURSE IT'S STUCK, YOU SIMPLE MORONS. YOU ONLY HAD 2 1/2 YEARS TO MEASURE IT. OF COURSE IT'S STUCK. THE PLUTONIUM JUST EXPANDED A LITTLE WHEN IT HEATED UP. ONCE THE ASSEMBLY HEATS UP, IT WILL EXPAND, AND THE CORE WILL FIT. OPPIE, YOU'VE GOT TO RELAX. COME ON. I BET YOU A MONTH'S SALARY AGAINST $10 IT WILL WORK. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE THAT BET. I'M SORRY. [METAL CREAKING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] AH, MR. PRESIDENT. WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH BERLIN. YOU SEEN IT YET? YES, AND NOT PRETTY, IS IT? IT'S TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE. OLD MEN, OLD WOMEN, LITTLE CHILDREN PULLING CARTS WITH THEIR FEW THINGS ON THEM TO WHO KNOWS WHERE. JUST TERRIBLE. SIR, I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW ALLAN DULLES OF THE O.S.S. MR. PRESIDENT. DULLES, NICE TO SEE YOU. JIMMY BYRNES. MR. BYRNES. IS STALIN HERE YET? NO, SIR, NOT YET. SOME JAPANESE CABLES THAT WE'VE INTERCEPTED... I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR, SIR. AND DULLES HAS JUST RETURNED FROM SWITZERLAND WITH INFORMATION ALONG THE SAME LINES. THE JAPANESE HAVE ASKED THE RUSSIANS TO MEDIATE AN END TO THE WAR WITH US. THIS IS FROM FOREIGN MINISTER TOGO TO THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR IN MOSCOW. "HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR, MINDFUL OF THE FACT "THAT THE WAR DAILY BRINGS EVIL AND SACRIFICE "UPON THE PEOPLES OF ALL BELLIGERENT POWERS, "DESIRES FROM HIS HEART THAT IT MAY BE QUICKLY TERMINATED. "HIS MAJESTY IS DEEPLY RELUCTANT TO HAVE ANY FURTHER BLOOD LOST "AMONG THE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES, "AND JAPAN IS DEFEATED. "WE MUST FACE THE FACT AND ACT ACCORDINGLY. "AND SINCE THE LOSS OF ONE DAY "MAY RESULT IN 1,000 YEARS OF REGRET, IT IS REQUESTED THAT YOU IMMEDIATELY HAVE A TALK"... HENRY, IF THEY WANT TO SURRENDER, LET THEM SURRENDER... UNCONDITIONALLY. YES, WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL, IF YOU TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR EMPEROR. DULLES HAS BEEN APPROACHED BY THE JAPANESE ALREADY DIRECTLY IN SWITZERLAND. THEY WANT TO SURRENDER IF THEY CAN RETAIN THE EMPEROR. WHO WAS THIS? MILITARY PEOPLE? YES, SIR. I DON'T THINK, AFTER PEARL HARBOR, JAPANESE HAVE ANY MILITARY HONOR. MR. PRESIDENT, THEY HAVE A DOZEN DIFFERENT FACTIONS OVER THERE SQUABBLING AMONG THEMSELVES AND AN ARMY THAT DOESN'T SUPPORT SURRENDER. LET THEM COME TO SOME AGREEMENT BETWEEN THEMSELVES. THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US. IN THE MEANTIME, WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEW MEXICO FIRST? [THUNDER CRASHING] [HORN HONKING] OPPENHEIMER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THAT TOWER WITH ALL THIS LIGHTNING AROUND?! CHECKING THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS! I'LL MEET YOU IN THE WEATHER SHACK! I BET THEY CALL IT OFF. IT'D BE CRAZY TO GO IN THIS WIND AND RAIN. YOU BET THAT? I INVITE BETS. AGAINST, FIRST, THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL HUMAN LIFE, AND SECOND, THAT OF HUMAN LIFE JUST IN NEW MEXICO. ATTEN-HUT! CARRY ON. GENTLEMEN, WOULD YOU WAIT OUTSIDE, PLEASE? WE'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE WEATHER IN HERE. YOU WANT US TO WAIT IN THE RAIN? YES. PLEASE. ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS IT WITH THIS WEATHER? IT'S PRETTY BAD, GENERAL. ZERO HOUR IS ONLY SEVEN HOURS AWAY, AND WE'VE GOT RAIN, WIND, AND LIGHTNING. LIEUTENANT, I CAN SEE THAT IT'S BAD. WHAT'S YOUR FORECAST? I'M NOT REALLY SURE. I THINK IT MAY LIFT. HOW ABOUT YOU, JACK? Jack: I THINK IT'S GOING TO CLEAR UP. YOU THINK? YOU THINK? CAPTAIN, I WANT YOU TO SIT DOWN, I WANT YOU TO WRITE YOUR FORECAST OUT IN LONGHAND, AND THEN I WANT YOU TO SIGN IT. AND IT BETTER BE ACCURATE, OR I WILL HANG YOU WITH IT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES, SIR. DO IT. WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS TESTING IN THIS WEATHER? WELL, THE WIND OR RAIN COULD BLOW THE RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT AND DROP IT ON A TOWN... OR ON OURSELVES. THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO ESCAPE. OUR EVACUATION ROUTES STINK. HOW ARE THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS HOLDING UP? SO FAR, ALL RIGHT, BUT THEY'LL START TO DETERIORATE SOON. PROBABLY HOLDING UP A LOT BETTER THAN YOU ARE. AH, I HATE TO POSTPONE. THEY'RE WAITING FOR US IN POTSDAM. YES, BUT IF IT DOESN'T CLEAR UP, I THINK WE HAVE TO. WHERE ARE THE GUARDS? WE PULLED THEM AFTER THE BOMB WAS ASSEMBLED IN CASE LIGHTNING HIT THE TOWER. WHERE'S KISTIAKOWSKY? YOU CHASED HIM OUT. GET HIM IN HERE. KISTIAKOWSKY! YOU KNOW HOW TO USE A RIFLE OR A MACHINE GUN? A RIFLE, SIR? YES. YOU AND YOUR MEN GET RIFLES AND GUARD THE TOWER. AGAINST WHAT, SIR? AGAINST WHAT? SABOTAGE... JAP PARATROOPERS, YOUR OWN PEOPLE... I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A PERFECT NIGHT FOR THEM. JUST DO IT. [SIGHS] I'M GONNA SACK OUT TILL ABOUT 1:00. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOOK AT IT THEN. YOU OUGHT TO DO THE SAME. YOU NEED TO RELAX. [THUNDER CRASHING] HERE COMES GENERAL PATTON. TELL HIM THE JAPANESE PARATROOPERS JUST LANDED BEHIND THAT HILL. YOU TELL HIM. ATTEN-HUT! YOU SAID IT WAS GONNA CLEAR. I THOUGHT IT WAS. WE'RE WAITING HERE ON THE PHONE. IT STILL MIGHT, GENERAL. IT'S HARD TO TELL FOR SURE. GET OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE NO USE TO ANYONE. I'LL FORECAST THE WEATHER MYSELF. YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT WE KNOW. WE'VE GOT TO GO IN THE DARK, WHEN PEOPLE ARE ASLEEP. OTHERWISE, WE GOT TOO MANY QUESTIONS. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IF WE GO IN THE RAIN IS OUR OBSERVATION PLANES CAN'T TAKE OFF. THE MEN HAVE BEEN UP FOR TWO NIGHTS STRAIGHT. IT WILL BE HARD TO GET THEM UP TO PITCH AGAIN IF WE CALL IT OFF. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S SAFE. I WANT IT TO BE SAFE, TOO. THEY'RE COUNTING ON US AT POTSDAM. [TELEPHONE RINGS] OPPENHEIMER. IT'S CLEARING. THEY SAY THE RAIN AND WIND WILL BOTH STOP BETWEEN 5:00 AND 6:00 A.M. HOW SURE ARE YOU? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY SAY THEY'RE PRETTY SURE. GENERAL? WE'LL GO AT 5:30. [ALARMS BLARING] Man: COMING UP ON "T" MINUS 2 MINUTES 30. IF YOU WATCH, LOOK THROUGH THIS SMOKED GLASS. ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY DO WHAT I DO! NOW, LAY DOWN BUT FACE AWAY FROM THE TOWER. AND KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED TIGHTLY UNTIL AFTER THE FLASH. THEN, AND ONLY THEN, USE THE SMOKED GLASS TO LOOK AT THE FIREBALL... ASSUMING THERE IS ONE. OPPIE, LET'S GO. "T" MINUS TWO MINUTES. MINUS ONE MINUTE 50. MINUS ONE MINUTE 40. HERE... SUNTAN LOTION TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE ULTRAVIOLET EMISSIONS. WHAT'S LIKELY TO HAPPEN, OPPIE, IS THAT AT MINUS 5 SECONDS, I'LL PANIC AND SAY, "GENTLEMEN, THIS CAN'T GO ON," THEN PULL THE SWITCH. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. SORRY. "T" MINUS ONE MINUTE. MINUS 40. [BLARING CONTINUES] MINUS 30. I'M GOING OUTSIDE. I WANT TO SEE THIS FOR MYSELF. MINUS 20. MINUS 15. 10, 9... 8, 7... 6, 5... 4... 3, 2, 1. [RUMBLING] Man: MY GOD. IT'S BRIGHTER THAN A STAR! IT'S BRIGHTER THAN TWO STARS. THE WAR IS OVER. THE WAR'S OVER WHEN WE DROP TWO BOMBS ON JAPAN. [CHEERING] [LAUGHS] WHOO-HOO! [CHEERING] WE DID IT! I WON THE BET! YOU OWE ME $10! I DON'T HAVE IT. [LAUGHS] AHH. I GOT TO GET BACK TO LOS ALAMOS RIGHT AWAY. THEY'VE GOT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS IN POTSDAM FIRST THING. YOU BETTER GET GOING, TOO. YOU'VE GOT A DATE WITH A B-29. YES, SIR. MR. COLT, THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THIS THING OVER AND FRY HUNDREDS OF JAPANESE. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW THE BHAGAVAD-GITA? "I AM BECOME DEATH... THE SHATTERER OF WORLDS." YEAH. NOW WE'RE ALL SONS OF BITCHES. I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE FIGURES. IT WORKED. IT WORKS. AS POWERFUL AS 20,000 TONS OF TNT. DETAILS ARE JUST COMING IN. LISTEN TO THIS. "FLASH SEEN 250 MILES AWAY, HEARD 100 MILES AWAY. "STEEL TOWER EVAPORATED. "SOLDIER STANDING 10,000 FEET AWAY WAS KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET. "WINDOW BROKEN 125 MILES AWAY. "LEFT A CRATER 1,200 FEET WIDE "IN WHICH EVERYTHING DISAPPEARED... DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY." WELL... WELL, WELL, WELL, NOW. I MET WITH STALIN THIS MORNING. HE SAID HE HAD SOME MORE QUESTIONS TO PRESENT, AND I TOLD HIM TO FIRE AWAY, AND HE DID, TOO. IT WAS DYNAMITE. BUT NOW I HAVE SOME DYNAMITE, TOO. THIS GIVES ME A COMPLETELY NEW FEELING OF CONFIDENCE. WELL, NOW... THIS WILL KEEP THE RUSSIANS STRAIGHT. HENRY, YOU LEAVE THOSE REPORTS WITH US, BRING THE REST AS THEY COME IN. YES. YES, OF COURSE. THEY SAW THE FLASH IN ALBUQUERQUE. GOOD MORNING, GENERAL. IT WAS SEEN IN EL PASO, TEXAS! A GIRL IN A SMALL TOWN 20 MILES AWAY WHO'D BEEN BLINDED AT BIRTH SAW THE LIGHT. OH, MY. ISN'T IT AMAZING? ALL RIGHT, TAKE A MEMO TO GENERAL MARSHALL IN POTSDAM. "PROBABLE DATE OF FIRST BOMBING... "ONE WEEK, WEATHER PERMITTING. "AT LEAST THREE DAYS NEEDED FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE BOMBING. APPROVED TARGETS... HIROSHIMA, NAGASAKI, KOKURA, NIIGATA." THAT'S N-I-I-G-A-T-A. GET THAT OUT RIGHT AWAY. YES, SIR. OH, IT WAS SOMETHING. IT WAS... IT WAS... IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT. WE DID IT. WE REALLY DID IT. WE DEVELOPED A WEAPON THAT COULD END THIS WAR. WE COULD SAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES. AND ISN'T THAT SOMETHING? IT IS AMAZING, GENERAL. IT SURE IS. IT SURE AS SHOOTING IS. [CHUCKLES] ALL RIGHT, SO, WHAT HAPPENED HERE WHILE I WAS IN NEW MEXICO? Nichols: WELL, WE GOT THIS PETITION THAT SZILARD HANDED AROUND ASKING PRESIDENT TRUMAN NOT TO DROP THE BOMB. HE GOT 68 OF THE OTHER SCIENTISTS TO SIGN IT. WANT TO SEND IT TO THE PRESIDENT IN POTSDAM? [SCOFFS] LEO SZILARD AND HIS HOBBYHORSE. WELL, OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS TO BE CLASSIFIED SECRET. AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, THE SECURITY ACT STATES THAT ALL SECRET DOCUMENTS CAN ONLY BE MOVED FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER UNDER ARMED MILITARY GUARD. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T SPARE ANY SOLDIERS RIGHT NOW TO PROTECT THIS DOCUMENT. SO, IN THE MEANTIME, WHY DON'T I JUST KEEP IT IN HERE... FOR SAFEKEEPING? SIR, DO YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO ASK THE PRESIDENT FOR A SPECIFIC ORDER AUTHORIZING DROPPING THE BOMB? I'M NOT ASKING ANYONE FOR A DAMN THING. I'VE GOT ALL THE AUTHORIZATION I NEED. BESIDES, TRUMAN'S LIKE A KID ON A TOBOGGAN. WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU, IKE? IT'LL END THE WAR. HAS IT BEEN FINALLY DECIDED TO USE IT? I JUST FIND THAT VERY, VERY DEPRESSING. TELL ME WHY. WELL, YOU KNOW, JAPAN IS ALREADY DEFEATED. DROPPING THE ATOMIC BOMB NOW IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY. WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT TO SAVE AMERICAN LIVES. JAPAN IS RIGHT NOW, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO SURRENDER WITHOUT LOSING FACE. IT'S MORE THAN THAT. I THINK AMERICA SHOULDN'T DO IT. I THINK WE'LL SHOCK WORLD OPINION. WOULD YOU TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT? AFTER ALL, AS SUPREME COMMANDER OF THE ALLIED FORCES THAT WON THE WAR, HE OUGHT TO KNOW YOUR FEELINGS. I'LL TELL HIM JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU. Downey: ALMIGHTY FATHER, WHO WILL HEAR THE PRAYER OF THEM THAT LOVE THEE, WE PRAY THEE TO BE WITH THOSE WHO BRAVE THE HEIGHTS OF THY HEAVEN AND CARRY THE BATTLE TO OUR ENEMIES. GUARD AND PROTECT THEM AS THEY FLY THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS. MAY THEY, AS WELL AS WE, KNOW THY STRENGTH AND POWER, AND ARMED WITH THY MIGHT, THAT THEY BRING THIS WAR TO A RAPID END. MAY THE MEN WHO FLY THIS NIGHT BE KEPT SAFE IN THY CARE. MAY THEY BE RETURNED SAFELY TO US. WE SHALL GO FORWARD TRUSTING IN THEE, KNOWING THAT WE ARE IN THY CARE NOW AND FOREVER. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, AMEN. Tibbets: Distance to Iwo Jima, R.V. 622 miles. This is the captain. We are carrying the world's first atomic bomb. When the bomb is dropped, Lieutenant Beser will record our reactions to what we see. This recording is being made for history. Watch your language and don't clutter up the intercom. Lewis: Cloud cover less than 3/10 at all altitudes. Advice, bomb primary. Position north tip Saipan, 4,700. Hiroshima dead ahead. 10 minutes to A.P. Bombs fully armed, Colonel. Open bomb door. We're about to start the bomb run. Put on your goggles. On glasses. Bomb away. Stand by for the tone break. And the turn. Look at that son of a bitch go. Hell. Okay, okay, that was the reflected shock wave. It bounced back from the ground. Won't be any more. Stay calm. My God. What have we done? OH, THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME, GENERAL. DAMNED IF THIS ISN'T THE GREATEST THING IN HISTORY. GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE JUST DROPPED AN ATOMIC BOMB ON JAPAN. NOW, THAT'S 2,000 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY BOMB EVER USED IN THE HISTORY OF WARFARE. WE HAVE WON THE GAMBLE. YOU'RE GOING HOME, BOYS! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Marshall: I THINK IN OUR STATEMENT, WE SHOULD GUARD AGAINST TOO MUCH GRATIFICATION OVER OUR SUCCESS. IT UNDOUBTEDLY INVOLVES A GREAT NUMBER OF JAPANESE CASUALTIES. I WASN'T THINKING SO MUCH OF JAPANESE CASUALTIES, GENERAL, AS I WAS ABOUT AMERICANS ON THE BATAAN DEATH MARCH. FATHER, EXCUSE ME. WOULD YOU SAY A SPECIAL PRAYER FOR THE DEAD OF HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI, AND START A COLLECTION FOR THE SURVIVORS? [MAN COUGHS] THE REACTION HAS BEGUN. WHAT DID THEY EXPECT? I MADE A GREAT MISTAKE WHEN I SIGNED THE LETTER TO PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT RECOMMENDING THAT AN ATOMIC BOMB BE MADE. THE WORLD IS NOT YET READY FOR IT. THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE WANTED TO SAVE OUR PEOPLE AND JAPANESE, AS WELL, AND WIN THE WAR. NOW, I'D SAY, YOU QUESTION ANY YOUNG MAN WHO WAS OVER THERE AND ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT IT, AND HE'LL TELL YOU OFF, AND HE WON'T USE POLITE LANGUAGE, EITHER. ALL THESE YOUNGSTERS I'M TALKING ABOUT WOULD HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED. THE JAPANESE ONLY SURRENDERED BECAUSE THE BOMBS WERE DROPPED. IN MY OPINION, THE USE OF THIS BARBAROUS WEAPON WAS OF NO MATERIAL ASSISTANCE IN OUR WAR AGAINST JAPAN. THE JAPANESE WERE ALREADY DEFEATED AND READY TO SURRENDER BECAUSE OF AN EFFECTIVE SEA BLOCKADE AND A SUCCESSFUL BOMBING WITH CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS. MY OWN FEELING IS THAT IN BEING THE FIRST TO USE IT, WE ADOPTED AN ETHICAL STANDARD COMMON TO THE BARBARIANS OF THE DARK AGES. I-I WAS NOT TAUGHT TO MAKE WAR IN THAT FASHION. WARS CANNOT BE WON BY DESTROYING WOMEN AND CHILDREN. BEFORE THE ATOM BOMB WAS USED, I WOULD HAVE SAID, YES, I WAS SURE WE COULD KEEP THE PEACE WITH RUSSIA. I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED AND DISTURBED ALL OVER. EVERYONE FEELS INSECURE AGAIN. IT WASN'T NECESSARY TO HIT THEM WITH THAT AWFUL THING. NOBODY IS MORE DISTURBED OVER THE USE OF THE BOMB THAN I AM, BUT I WAS GREATLY DISTURBED OVER THE UNWARRANTED ATTACK BY THE JAPANESE ON PEARL HARBOR AND THEIR MURDER OF OUR PRISONERS OF WAR. THE ONLY LANGUAGE THEY SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND WAS THE ONE WE USED TO BOMBARD THEM. WHEN YOU DEAL WITH A BEAST, YOU HAVE TO TREAT THEM AS A BEAST. [APPLAUSE] IT IS WITH APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE THAT I ACCEPT THIS CERTIFICATE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE LOS ALAMOS LABORATORY, FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHOSE WORK AND WHOSE HEARTS HAVE MADE IT. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT IN YEARS TO COME, WE MAY LOOK AT THIS CERTIFICATE AND ALL THAT IT SIGNIFIES WITH PRIDE. TODAY, THAT PRIDE MUST BE TEMPERED WITH A PROFOUND CONCERN. IF ATOMIC BOMBS ARE TO BE ADDED TO THE ARSENALS OF NATIONS PREPARING FOR WAR, THEN A TIME WILL COME WHEN MANKIND WILL CURSE THE NAMES OF LOS ALAMOS AND HIROSHIMA. THE PEOPLES OF THIS WORLD MUST UNITE, OR THEY WILL PERISH. THIS WAR THAT HAS RAVAGED SO MUCH OF THE EARTH HAS WRITTEN THESE WORDS. THE ATOMIC BOMB HAS SPELLED THEM OUT FOR ALL MEN TO UNDERSTAND. OTHER MEN HAVE SPOKEN THESE WORDS IN OTHER TIMES, OF OTHER WARS, OF OTHER WEAPONS. THEY HAVE NOT PREVAILED. AND THERE ARE SOME MISLED BY A FALSE SENSE OF HUMAN HISTORY, WHO WILL HOLD THAT WE WILL NOT PREVAIL TODAY. IT IS NOT FOR US TO BELIEVE THAT. BY OUR WORKS, WE ARE COMMITTED... COMMITTED TO A WORLD UNITED BEFORE THIS COMMON PERIL IN LAW AND IN HUMANITY. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY ACORN MEDIA
