[upbeat instrumental music] [footsteps thudding] - Come along. [gentle instrumental music] [footsteps thudding] [whistle trills] [upbeat instrumental music] No, no, no, no. Give it. [gentle instrumental music] Ready? [whistle trills] - Over here. Come on, pass. Give it to me. Come on. [music drowns out male speaking] [upbeat instrumental music] Let's go! [child speaks indistinctly] - Off! [indistinct chattering] - Miss, it's not fair. He hit me first. [upbeat instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] - Goal! Yay! - Score, score. [indistinct chattering] - No, no, no, no, no, kick off. Kick off. [indistinct chattering] Here. [indistinct chattering] [gentle instrumental music] [engines rumbling] [mellow instrumental music] [gentle instrumental music] [mellow instrumental music] [plane engine roars] [gentle instrumental music] [shutter clicking] - She's really very pretty. Lucky fellow. - Thank you. [shutter clicking] - What does she teach? - French. French and football. - Ah, of course, she is French. - Yeah. [shutter clicks] - And the uncle's English? - Yeah, she's lived with him since her parents died. [shutter clicks] - Get on with him? - Yes. Don't know how he got to be a minister, but why, I like him. [shutter clicks] - Ah, the happy couple. [clicking] You look very good together. Can't have been unpleasant. - Ah, it's been fine. Where's it all leading? - Where does three month's courtship usually lead, hmm? Congratulations. [ringing] - He wants to marry me. - Blast, Fabienne, how could you? Over 8,000 and a free bowl to come. Who wants to marry you? - John does. John Fenton. - Fenton? Marriage? I'm not sure I like the fellow. - Of course you do. - He's too, what's the word? [machine rumbles] Smooth, I suppose. Like a television commercial. [machine clanks] I see him riding out of the sea, not a hair out of place, smoking a menthol cigarette. - That's because he always beats you at this. - Yeah. Who's affairs? England versus France. The crowd intense with excitement. Do you love him? - I don't know. It's so sudden. He attracts me, makes me laugh with joke, and he's very good in bed. - Yeah, yes, yes. England one, France nil. In bed? Whose bed? When? - My bed tonight. - But I was having dinner. I had guest for dinner, the Argentine ambassador. And you were making love just a floor away? - Pay attention, Uncle. - Oh. - France equalized. - Oh, right against the run of play. Here we go now. Down the wing, shoot! [game table clatters] Goal! England two, France one. Fabienne, you have no defense. - Oh, I know. It has always been my trouble. [church bells tolling] [indistinct chattering] - Good luck, Miss. - Miss me. - Where are they going for their honeymoon, or is it a secret? - No secret, Romania. He's got business there or something. - Oh, how original. [car engine turns over] [engine roars] - Gaining a nephew? - Yes. [gentle instrumental music] [plane engine roars] ♪ La la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la la la la ♪ - Keep the change. [car door slams shut] - It looks funny, like Paris a long time ago. - Well, the food taste of it came from Paris a long time ago [chuckles]. Fenton, Mr. And Mrs. - For how long, sir? - Forever, I hope. - No, Madame, I mean, for how long- - Just two or three days. - Ah, Mr. Fenton, welcome back again. - Hello. - Nice to see you. Madame, [speaks in a foreign language]. - What does that mean? [phone rings] - That means nothing but the best. [male speaks indistinctly] [phone continues ringing] [mysterious dramatic music] [object clatters] Mmm, that's nice. Very sexy. [gentle instrumental music] - I was coming to turn down the beds. - Perfect timing. [door slams shut] [intense dramatic music] Waiter? [object clatters] - Coming, sir. - Waiter? - Coming, sir! Yes, sir? - We'd like something to drink. - What can I offer you, champagne? - French? - Bulgarian. - There's nothing sacred. I think we'll just have two of your genuine Rumanian Irish coffees. - But perhaps not for one hour, [door clatters open] or two? [door slams shut] - 118 want two coffees, but there's no hurry. [door slams shut] [gentle instrumental music] - I'm sorry. It's an odd place for a honeymoon. As soon as I've cleared up this business, we'll go to Crete or somewhere, get some sun. - It's a perfect place. [gentle instrumental music] [lamp switch clicks] [gentle instrumental music] [mysterious dramatic music] [John gasps] - John Fenton? - What the hell do you want? - You are under arrest. [footsteps thudding] [banging at door] [bell rings] [banging at door] [bell rings] - I want to see the ambassador! - Good god almighty, you'll wake the whole damned household. - I demand to see him! It's my right! - Two o'clock in the morning? - Where is he? - You're not even English. You've got a foreign accent. - I'm French and also English. I demand my rights as a French-British subject! - You people really have the most frightful cheek. I suppose you've lost your money, or your passport, or you've been raped by some Gypsy violinist? - My husband has been arrested by the Secret Police from hotel. We're on our honeymoon, and they just barged in - Oh, look. - In the middle- - I do apologize. I didn't mean to shout at you like that. I was a bit upset myself, all that noise at the door. I thought we were being stormed again. - Please, let me see the ambassador? - We're leaving no stone unturned. I'm going to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at once. And in London, the Foreign Secretary is sending a note. - Sending a note? Should be sending the Army. - Your husband has been arrested on charges of espionage against the Soviet Union. - My husband? That's ridiculous. - They claim to have found evidence. [Fabienne chuckles] - When can I see him? - He's already been taken to Moscow. I'm sorry. We must get her back to London. There's a plane at noon. - Well, I think I've got [speaks indistinctly]. You check in to London over there. But actually, we've got half an hour before we- - You've been very kind. Please, don't wait. I can manage perfectly well. - Oh, all right. If you're sure? - Yes. - Well, look- - Goodbye. - You know, good luck. - Thank you. - And- - Thank you. - Yes, Miss. - When's the next plane to Moscow? - Oh, there is not one now until this evening. - This evening? How far is it? Can I rent a car? - You cannot drive to Moscow. - The train then! When's the next train? - There is one at three o'clock, but it's still quicker to wait for the plane. - I'll wait. [male speaks indistinctly over PA] - Good morning, Mrs. Fenton. We met in the hotel. - Oh, yes. You're the waiter. Hello. - It's a long wait for the Moscow plane. [indistinct chattering in the distance] Sorry to hear about what happened to your husband. - You speak English very well. - Thank you. - Could I buy you a drink? - Oh, no, thank you. - Please? Got a lot of time. Come on. [plane engine roars] What does your husband do? - Business. Imports and exports. - With the Eastern block? - Mostly. [plane engine whirs] - Drink. Here. Romanian style, it brings you luck. Like this. [Andrej exhales loudly] [glass clanks] [Fabienne gasps and coughs] That's good. Is he innocent? - Well, of course he is. - Sometimes it makes no difference, if it suits their purpose. Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, they found a mummy in Egypt. None of the world's scientists could agree how old is he, so the Russians said, "We'll take it back to Moscow", and submit it to a secret test." They came back in two days with a full report. The mummy was a man. He died of pneumonia at the age of 38, and he was a prune and raisin merchant. Everyone was astonished. "How'd you find out?", they asked. "Easy", said the Russians. "The mommy made a full confession." [Andrej laughs] [laugh echoing] [male speaks indistinctly] [intense eerie tones] [plane engine roars] - Psst. Psst. This man, he's kidnapping me. I have been drugged and kidnapped. - Take no notice. - Where are you taking me? - Miss? - To the Secret Police, I suppose. - Please, no speak English. - Where are we going? Are we going to Moscow? - Moscow [chuckles]? I hope not. We're due back in Manchester at four o'clock. - Are you feeling better, Miss? We're just starting our approach to London. Now, would you fasten your seatbelts, please? [plane engine roars] - No sign at the moment. Mrs. John Fenton, wife of the British businessman detained by the Russian's on charges of espionage, arrived back at Heathrow late this afternoon. [phone rings] Mrs. Fenton was met by her uncle, Sir Trevor Dawson, the Shadow Foreign Secretary. [object clangs] There is feeling amongst diplomatic sources, the charges against Mr. Fenton will be serious. [footsteps thudding] [doorbell rings] [door clatters open] - Is Haldane here? - In the library, sir. - Help Bowlan with the luggage, and get rid of those bloody press people. - Very good, sir. - And bring the whiskey with you. - Very good, sir. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you'll all have to- [footsteps thudding] - Haldane, good of you to come. My dear, this is Commander Haldane, who's going to be - Thank you. - A great help to us. He is in a position to... Haven't you got a drink? - Scotch. - Oh, Beech did leave you a drop, did he? [Haldane chuckles] The Commander knows things, my dear. - I should hope so. He's head of British intelligence. - Who told you that? You're not supposed to know that. Did you tell her that? - I didn't know she knew. - Uncle, everybody knows. - It's supposed to be a closely guarded secret. - How's Commander Haldane going to get my husband back? - You'll see. You'll see. - Only a handful of people know, the Prime Minister, my wife. Mandy? No, she wouldn't. Hmm? - How are you going to get my husband back? - Ah, well, nothing to worry about there. John's arrest is a typical Soviet tactic. Some months ago, we arrested an extremely important agent of theirs. His name is Webb, amongst others. Obviously, the Russian's want him back very badly. They've offered to exchange him for John. - You mean all the charges against John were made up? - Quite monstrous, but effective. If we don't accept, John's likely to end up with 15 years. - You see, the Russian's are relying on the fact that because John is married to you, I'd use my position to accelerate an exchange, which I must say, I regard as an insult to my professional integrity. - Certainly. - But you will pull ropes. You must do. - Strings, strings. - Oh, Uncle, pull whatever you like, but I want John back. - Don't worry. It's all arranged for next Thursday. [somber instrumental music] [car door clatters open] - Well, he's here, sir. - Can I see? [somber instrumental music] Why, yes. - Where's the wretched Russian? - Oh, what a bloody dark. I could've been in Berlin now with Hilda. [man speaks in a foreign language] [engine rumbles] [car door slams shut] - Brr! [golfclubs clanging] Careful with that. My wok whisk is in there. Where's my number six? My number six? Ah. And watch my LPs, huh? I don't want them scratched. Oh. Now, where's "The Sound of Music?" That was for my mother. I am not leaving the West without "The Sound of Music." [door slams shut] - Please hurry. I've been waiting for hours. - You're the wife? - Yes. - Ah. Delighted. - You're Webb, one presumes? - Certainly not! Who told you that? Oh, yes, yes, of course I am. Excuse me, force of habit. [Webb chuckles] I'm glad that it is me that brings you and your husband together. - If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have been apart. - Not me, my dear lady. Politics. - May we get on? My feet are freezing. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, have I got everything? Ah, thank you, thank you. Just a few souvenirs of Western decadence. Here, split this between the two of you. - Let's get this unbearable man outta here, back where he belongs. - Yes, but it's just that I seem to have mislaid the movement orders. Ha! - Are you sure you won't miss the decadent West? [Webb scoffs] - Good Lord, no. At home, I shall be a big star. They'll give me a pension. Thank you [laughs]. A flat near Red Square, girls, beef vodka, [grunts] and a season ticket to the Bolshoi [laughs]. - Farewell, filthy imperialist swine. [dramatic instrumental music] [gear clatters] [dramatic instrumental music] [eerie dramatic music] - It will soon be all over. [gear clatters] [eerie dramatic music] [gear clatters] [eerie dramatic music] [creaking] [Webb shutters] - Oh. [water splashing] [Webb yells] [Webb shouts indistinctly] [intense dramatic music] - Unfortunate, of course, from your point of view, but a fitting end, wouldn't you think? - Red's the ball, in off the side. [ball clanks] - How's she taking it? - Oh, quite calmly. quite calmly. [door slams shut] - Did I disturb your game? - No, just relaxing, my dear [chuckles]. Pressures of the day. - Would any of those pressures have anything to do with my husband? - We're leaving no stone unturned. - No stone unturned! We're sending notes and writing memos! Ta-ta-dah-dah-dah-dah. You've lost a spy, [ball clanks] so use another! - I'd like nothing better, but we haven't got one, at least no one that important. - You haven't got one? Such a disgrace. What do you do all day? - It's been very quiet recently. - All right, if you two aren't prepared to help, I'll find someone myself. - Fabienne, there's no possible way for you to- - Why not? I live in the house of the Governor Minister. You go to parties. You give receptions. I have to do something. While you stand here playing billiards, poor John is famishing to death. - Starving. - To death! He's in federal prison! [door clatters open] [door slams shut] - Got a lot of spirit, that girl. - Certainly buggered up our game. - Now, there was a certain irony about his death caused by his own greed. He'd been corrupted by your society. [John sighs] - I could be in London now at a nice restaurant, and my loving bride eager to make up for lost time. - Don't think I'm not upset. Of course, I am. I'm as upset as you are. He was bringing me six bottles of malt whiskey, plain Grand. - Well, haven't they got anybody else they could swap for me? - Pustyaki, small fry, dispensables. - What do they do all day? - They are very incompetent. They only caught Webb because he got careless. He was supposed to be a welder at the missile factory. - Well, what went wrong? - He was living in a suite at the Hilton. - So Stefan, when do I get home? I mean, how long are you going to keep here? - Don't complain. For a man with a 15 year sentence, you're very comfortable. We don't even torture you. - Have you seen Russian television? - John, John, you came into this with your eyes wide open, focused firmly on the 50,000 pounds we're paying you. We've had a setback. It's an occupational hazard. - Yes, but this isn't my occupation. I'm not a, well, spy. I'm a- - A corrupt businessman. - Yes. - What's your hurry? We look after you. Cigars, vodka, girls. - Girls? Two civil engineers and a discus thrower. [John sighs] - Bronze medalist. [indistinct chattering] [car door slams] [engine whirs] [indistinct chattering] [upbeat instrumental music] [cork pops] [upbeat instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] - I'm not happy, Fabienne. The third-rate champagne I shall have to drink, the people I'm gonna have to meet. Oh, how good of you to come. Very nice of you to come. [Fabienne speaks indistinctly] I can't see how a reception for the Hungarian State Myman Dance Company is going to attract sinister figures from the world of espionage. - Uncle, cultural attaches, ministers of tourism. - Nice of you to come. - It's a well know fact, - Nice of you to come. - They're all spies. - Fabienne, really. - And watch out for homosexuals. - I beg your pardon? - It's also a well know fact that most people involved in espionage are homosexuals. - Yes, well, I'm not surprised. There're everywhere. In my grandfather's day, they used to horse feed homosexuals, then, they accepted them. Now, they're fashionable. And before long, they'll be compulsory. - Champagne, sherry, or spirits? - No. [Fabienne mumbles] [car door slams] [footsteps thudding] [indistinct chattering in the distance] [metal jingles] - Fabienne, I think if we just circulate. - Victoria? I need you. - Excuse us, Mummy. - I'll take care of her. - Trevor. - Celia, how wonderful. - What a wonderful party. - Isn't it very ghastly? But you may have saved my evening. Where's your George? - Getting sloshed somewhere. - Ah. Beech, we're going to slip away. I'm gonna show you the greenhouse. - At this time of night? - What better time? Tomatoes by moonlight. - Champagne, sir? - No, I don't care much for this caterer's stuff. Have you got anything in your stolen reserve, Beech? - Veuve Clicquot, '64? - Splendid. [upbeat music] [door clatters] [indistinct chattering the distance] [footsteps thudding] - I need a Russian, or a Czech, or Romanian, Bulgarian, East German, or Hungarian. - No Chinese? No, I wouldn't take a Chinese. If you see someone who looks suspicious. - The only person that looks suspicious is your uncle with my mother. - Ah, keep your eyes open. - I am, for Daddy [laughs]. - Mmm, please, Victoria. - Oh, really, Fabienne. The sort of person you're looking for is hardly likely to turn up at your uncle's party. [door slams] - You're not helping. [upbeat instrumental music] [indistinct chattering] Beech? Who's that man? - An Albanian, Miss. - How can you tell? - One can always tell an Albanian. It must be their bandit upbringing. It's the way they enter a room, taking advantage of the natural cover. [footsteps thudding] [doors clattering] - It's a lie! I never touched her! Even if I did, I plead diplomatic immunity. [door slams] [faint gentle instrumental music] - Please, I must know, where is the bathroom? - Oh, straight ahead. [door clatters] - She's a liar! I never touched her! [door clatters] [clicking] [door slams] [lock clanks] [faint gentle instrumental music] [door clatters] [door slams] [object thudding] [knocking at door] - Who's in here? [knocking at door] Open the door. [object thuds] [glass shatters] [knocking at door] [door clatters open] What are you doing locked in my friend's bedroom? - Sshh, I was waiting for your friend. - My friend's downstairs looking for Eastern Europeans. Are you one? - Hungarian, if it helps? - Yes, that'll do. Do you work at the Embassy or something? - I'm the Naval attache. [both laughing] - You've got one too. [Victoria giggles] [door slams] Oh. [Victoria moans] [gentle instrumental music] [door clatters] [Victoria giggles] - Victoria? [Victoria moans] Victoria, you're not helping. - If you'll excuse me. - Where are you going? - Duty calls. Thank you, Mrs. Fenton, for a lovely party. - You? [door slams] Stop! Wait a minute! I want to talk to you. Wait! [footsteps thudding] [door slams] [door jiggles] You're a fool, Victoria! I wanted that man. - I rather did myself. [indistinct chattering] - Oh, sorry! [metal clangs] Uncle, Uncle! Did you see him? - What? Some idiot threw this through the greenhouse roof, and Celia's hurt her knee. [engine roars] - All right, but I really don't see what you can do. - I know you will say, I'm imaging things, but we are being followed. [footsteps thudding] - Men like that are always following girls. - He's been with us all morning. - Fabienne. - I'll prove it. You go this way, and I'll go that way, and we'll see who he follows. - All right, but I'm having a lunch at San Lorenzo. Shall I see you there? - If I'm not there in half an hour, you'll know what to do. - Yes, order your cantelloni. [somber instrumental music] [upbeat quirky music] [footsteps thudding] [upbeat instrumental music] [footsteps thudding] [upbeat mellow music] [footsteps thudding] [indistinct chattering] [cash register dings] [indistinct chattering] - Anybody's seat? - Help yourself. [indistinct chattering] [cash register dings faintly] [indistinct chattering] Haven't we met somewhere before? - You were following me in the park. - Oh, god. - I probably look different without glasses. - I told them. I warned them. I said, "Don't put me on outside jobs." "Don't put me on following and things like that." "I'll only make a mess of it." See, I'm a behind-the-scenes man. I deal in broad concepts. But I'm not cut out for this outdoor, man in a trench coat stuff. I catch colds, and bicycles knock me over. - And people spot you. - Apparently. - Mmm-hmm. Do you always wear that hat? - It was part of my disguise. - It looks ridiculous. Who asked you to follow me? - I can't tell you that. It's more than my life's worth. These lips are sealed. - It was that Hungarian, wasn't it? - Not necessarily. - Are you going to follow me all day? - I'm supposed to. I was just writing my report. - But you lost me? - Well, I'm making it up. - Ah. Did I have a nice time? - Not bad. [Fabienne giggles] - I'd never buy shoes there [chuckles], and you missed out lunch. May I? I'm going to San Lorenzo, okay? See you later. - Thank you. - Hey, wait. [upbeat instrumental music] - From Senora Fenton. [upbeat instrumental music] - I had a word with the Home Secretary today? - Oh, yeah? - About another matter. - Oh, did you? Hmm, any joy? - Seemed quite optimistic. - Two seats, center court, women's doubles. - Quite optimistic. - Good. - You couldn't get a big spy. What about few little ones? - Oh, really, Fabienne? You might just as well put an advertisement in the "Times". "Wanted: suspicious-looking Eastern European homosexuals." No, come on. We'll get John back through normal channels. - I can't wait that long. - I hope she's not gonna do anything foolish. - Don't worry, I put someone on her. - Really? You mean some sorta shadow? - Yes. Been with her two days now, just in case. [glass clangs] [object thuds] - Invite him in, ma'am? Into the house? Across the threshold, as it were? - Yes, but give me a moment to change. Oh, where was the brandy? In your room, I suppose? - Only because I've been dusting the decanter, ma'am. - Oh, of course. [mysterious dramatic music] [metal jangles] [clicking] [rustling] [glasses clang] [clattering] [eerie dramatic music] [door slams] [glasses clanging] [thudding] - Mrs. Fenton will receive you upstairs, sir. Third floor. Should I take your pummel, sir? - I brought it with me because I didn't want it stolen. - It will be quite safe with us, sir. I assure you. [footsteps thudding] [knocking at door] [rustling] [door rattles and thuds] [knocking at door] - Come in. [door clatters open] [gentle instrumental music] Close the door. [door slams] [glass clinking] [liquid sloshing] You must be freezing out there. [glasses clank] Have some brandy. - Oh, thank you. Very nice of you. I'm not due off 'til eight. I was going straight home to have a hot bath. [liquid sloshing] - If you like, tomorrow night, you can follow me to the pictures. - Oh, can we go to the Classic? It's "The Mummy's Curse" and "Attack of the Crab People." - If you tell me who you work for. - Can't, out of the question. - What is your name? [gentle instrumental music] [rustling] - Baxter. Baxter Clarke. - You're obviously English. - Don't jump to conclusions, not in this game. It could just be part of the cover, a cunning device. I'm nothing like I appear to be. - Baxter, come and sit down beside me. [glass clanks] You must be tired. - Weary. Weary and cynical. [Baxter hiccups] Sometimes I can hardly live with myself. Can I come and live with you? - If you tell me things. - Hey, you're not trying to wheedle things out of me, are you? - I don't know. I don't know what I want. But when you sit near me, I feel so alive inside. - Yes. [Fabienne giggles] I have this effect on women. There was this friend of my mother's. Every time- - Why don't you kiss me? - I think I will. [Fabienne gasps] This isn't just work, you know? I mean, I do want you. - So do I, from the first time I saw you, even wearing your hat. - I feel quite excited. - Why don't you take a shower? You're so tense. It'll help you relax. - As long as it doesn't damper my ardor. [clicking] [gentle instrumental music] [water rushing] Right, I shall return wet and sexy, and then wheedle away. [gentle instrumental music] [door clatters] [water rushing] [Baxter hums] [water splashing] Mrs. Fenton! [door slams] Where are you? Mrs. Fenton? [door clatters] [footsteps thudding] [door rattles] [Baxter mumbles] - Allow me, please. [lock clicks] Goodnight. [door slams] - I've got one. - Huh? - No thanks to you. Come and see. - I had a double six. [footsteps thudding] - Clarke! - Sir, I can explain. No, I can't. So really this all came out for the best, because I'm back in filing where I belong. I enclosed a photo of myself as a memento. It was taken on a cycling holiday when I cut my knee, hence the bandage. I wish you the best of luck. Please ring me if ever you need anything decoded. Sincere wishes, Yours faithfully, Baxter Clarke. P.S., I love you. [children shouting indistinctly] - Tackle him! [mysterious dramatic music] - Kick it now! [whistle trills] [children shouting indistinctly] - Goal kick. - Goal kick. [child shouts indistinctly] - No, no, no, no. [children all chattering indistinctly] Kick off. [children shouting indistinctly] [whistle trills] - Get on with it. - It was a goal kick, Mister. - Don't argue with the referee. Goal kick! [children shout indistinctly] - Who are you? - It's time we had a little talk. - I'm listening. - Come on. [child shouts indistinctly] - Here we go again. - Why did you drug me at the airport? And you had something to do with my husband's arrest. - That was just my bad luck. - You're bad luck? - How did I know he was gonna get arrested? - Oh, I'm sorry he made things so difficult for you. - I don't want apologies. I just want what I put in your suitcase. - My suitcase? - And it's not there now! - Gone? - Gone where? Do I make an offer? - I'm not sure I know what you're talking about. - I guess it better be a pretty large offer? - I must think about this very carefully. Where do I get in touch with you? [Andrej chuckles] - You don't. I get in touch with you. Tomorrow. [indistinct chattering] [whistle trills] [child speaks indistinctly] - You two, do you think you could follow that man without being seen? - Who is he? - I don't know, but he may be just the man I'm looking for. [engine rumbles] - Here! - Sorry, thanks. [engine rumbles] [indistinct chattering] - 1644, please. [indistinct chattering] Thank you. [doorbell rings] - We want to see Mrs. Fenton. - About what? - We have information of a confidential nature. - I'll give you confidential! Get off those steps! Get out, out, out! - Beech? - Get! Madam? - It's all right. Let them in. - Into the house, Madame? - Yes, let them in. - Hey, wipe your bleedin' feet! [door slams] [indistinct chattering] [phone ringing] - 1644, please. Thank you. - I'm always forgettin my key, and it's such a long way down. Thank you. - That's all right, Madame. [door slams] [dramatic instrumental music] [papers rustling] [dramatic instrumental music] [objects clattering] [lock clicks] - I thought I heard you go out. - Oh, [chuckles] there's something in my room I want. - Time for a drink? - Oh, no, not tonight, Madame. - Madame? - That's rather formal after last night. - On the other hand, [door slams] perhaps we will have that drink. Where's your husband? - Out of sight, out of mind [chuckles]. [door slams] - It's good news week. - He's not out for a week, just an hour. - Oh. [fabric rustling] [giggles] You know, I was expecting another French girl tonight. She also has a husband out of sight. - Oh, I hope she doesn't disturb us. - She better not. - What's she like? - Freckles everywhere. She hasn't got legs as good as yours. [laughs] [knocking at door] - Simone? - Oh, la la! - Simone? [female speaks indistinctly] - Quick, in there. [door rattles] No there, darling. Here. [door clatters] [door slams] - My wife's in here, isn't she? - Certainly not. - There's no good denying it. - What Kind of a man do you think I am? - That's her perfume, isn't it? - Now, that's ridiculous. - I'm not new to this, you know? I've sniffed her out of many a hotel bedroom. Simone? Ah, I'm terribly sorry. - You should be. - I thought you were my wife. - And I thought you were my husband, that's why I'm in the wardrobe. I think I have to go, darling. - I'll go with you, darling. - No, no, no. - I don't know how to apologize. - You know how jealous my husband is. - It's my wife, you see. - He's got a young blood on his mother's side. - It happens all the time. I hope I haven't ruined your evening. - Don't follow me! This is goodbye forever! - Forever? Never. - She even had an affair with our marriage guidance counselor. - Go away! Leave me alone! - Ah, you can't mean that? - Tell him not to come. My husband may be in the lobby. - Her husband may be in the lobby. - A man has to do what a man has to do. [bell dinging] [doors clattering] - I hope I haven't... Mother was right, I should never have married a convent girl. [door clatters] [motor whirs] - What were you doing in my wardrobe? What were you doing in my wardrobe? - Hiding. There was a woman. - I mean, she had an invitation. - You knew I was there. - Of course. - You knew I was there, but you were still going to make love with that woman. - Look, I didn't complain when you were seducing that boy on a bicycle while I was hiding in the shower. [bell dings] - Kon Tiki Lounge. [doors clattering] Your floor, sir, Kon Tiki Lounge. - What? No, no, no, no, no. Drive on. [door clatters] - Do I sense a lack of trust? - Why should I trust a spy? First, you're a waiter, then, you're a diplomat, you drug me in Bucharest, broke into my uncle's house, and have affairs with other men's wives. And no one's complained about my legs before. [bell dings] - Ground floor. [doors clattering] [footsteps thudding] - She said he was a spy. - A lot of them about this time a year. [doors clattering] [laughing] [indistinct chattering] - Just a minute. Our affair's making progress. We're in complete harmony. Neither of us trust the other an inch. We don't like each other very much. Sure, I knew you were in the wardrobe, but let me tell you the point of that exercise. Whenever you think, he wouldn't do that, he would. You know what I want. - Yes. - Do we have a deal? - Yes, yes, definitely. I've got what you want. - The price? - 1,000 pounds. - When do I collect? - I'll call you tomorrow. I need time to arrange things. [indistinct chattering] - Call me at seven at this number, and remember, I would. ♪ La la la la la la la la la ♪ La la la la la la la la [John groans] - I see you're up to three a day. - Huh? Right. Well, what news from the outside world? - News from England. It seems the conscience of the nation, so stirred by your arrest, has turned its attention to the garbage strike. - Yeah. - But your little wife has been very active. - Well, how do you know? - We have someone watching her. - What for? - Because she intends to catch a spy herself to exchange for her loved one. - Do they care? - Perhaps not. Do you know this man? - Hmm? [John speaks indistinctly] No, can't say I do. Hey, that's taken in the park. That's where I met her. What's he up to with my wife? - I don't know. We can't follow her everywhere. - Who is he? - A man we would be most willing to exchange for you, an enemy of Russia. - But the British aren't gonna change me for an enemy of Russia. I'm not missed that much. - They might, if they think he's an enemy of Britain. Just the question of making things seem what they're not. - You're the experts. - So your wife may solve all our problems with a little help from her friends. - I found a spy, Baxter. - Would you like some banana? - I found a spy, a real one. No, thanks. - Well, I'm very pleased for you. Have you wheedled anything out of him yet? - I don't need to. I am going to frame him. - That's a bit dirty, isn't it? - It's a dirty game, Baxter, as you should know. - True. None of us are clean in this business. How are you going to frame him then? - He thinks I have something he wants. I'll use it as bait to get him out of London, and while he's away, evidence can be planted in his room. - What sort of evidence? - Oh, government papers, secret files, anything you can get. You're the perfect person. You have access to all sorts of things. All you have to do, is steal something secret, and plant it in this man's room. - Is that all? - Yes! - Oh, I thought you wanted something difficult. - No. - All you want is for me to steal something top secret from government files, for which I could get 25 years, but with remission for good conduct, I should be out by my early 40s. - He's the one who will go to prison. You can be the one to give the tip-off. You'll get all the credit for catching him. You will be a hero. Baxter, do you want to be a foreign clerk all your life? Just a number, and a grade at the ministry of whatever? - Yes. - You said you loved me. - Well, I do, in principle. - Who else can I turn to? You sent me a letter offering help if ever I should need it. - Yes. - And now, when I need it, who's turning me down? Rejecting me? - Ah, bloody hell. [ball thuds] - Hello? - It's me. - Are we in business? - Yes. Listen to me very carefully. I have what you want. I'm in Paris. - Paris? - Yes, there is a plane to Orly at eight o'clock. I will be waiting for you. - Why Paris? - We're in no position to ask questions. [phone clatters] [phone rings] Hello? - How's the weather in Paris? - This is a recorded announcement. Mrs. Fenton is not in at the moment. Please leave your name and your number, and she'll ring you when I get back. I mean, when she gets back. [phone clatters] [alarm buzzing] [phone clatters] Who's there? - I came as soon as I could. [Fabienne gasps] [phone clatters] [indistinct chattering] - Beech! - How's your 88? - Beech? Beech? Wake up, wake up! [Beech mumbles] I am being attacked. Beech! - Mr. Trevor's is not at home. - Over here for the beer. [Fabienne yells] - Anything you see is in the drawing room. [intense dramatic music] [phone clatters] [phone dial clanks] - Ha! [Fabienne screams] - Young lady, it seems to take a long time for anything to sink in your pretty French head. There are a few things you're going to tell me first. Have you got my package? Have you? [Fabienne yells] - No, no, not here. - Well, who has? What was all this Paris crap? What was that a setup for? - I was scared of you, of dealing with you alone, and had to get someone to help me in Paris. - It's going to be a long, hard night. So much I wanna know. So much you're gonna tell me. [smacking] [Fabienne screams] [muffled screaming] - What about the girl? - Can't leave her here to talk, take her with you. [phone clatters] [Andrej groans] - Hey! - Don't draw the curtains, Beech. - Hey, it's time for Madame to get up. [Fabienne gasp and moans] - What? Oh, my head. I feel terrible. I feel sick. - Chloroform. - Where are we going? - I don't know, but I don't intend to arrive there. [engine rumbling increases] [door clattering] Come on! - I can't! We'll kill ourselves! [Fabienne yells] [intense dramatic music] [gunshots firing] [cows mooing] Are they dangerous? - Well, at least they don't have guns. [cows mooing] [dramatic instrumental music] Just hit me, cow. [intense dramatic music] [cows mooing] [intense dramatic music] [groaning] [cows mooing] [Fabienne groans] - Hey! [gunshot firing] [metal clanging] - All together. [smacking] [male groaning] Thanks for giving me a hand. Get rid of these. - I'm worn out. I won't! I can't go any further! - Oh, shut up, and keep walking. - Where are we? Where are we? - Scotland, at the Loch Awe. - How do you know? [bird cawing] [rattling] - I highly recommended it. [Fabienne sighs] [door rattling] [glass shattering] [lock clicks] [door clatters] [footsteps thudding] [bell rings] [door slams] - I'm cold. - We'll start a fire. - Do you know who those men were? - You have been trying to set me up for something, and I'm gonna find out what. - I've never seen them before, honestly. - Let's get this straight, all I want is what I put in that suitcase. - I don't know anything about the suitcase, or what was in it. I was making it up. I was making it all up. - Why? [Andrej scoffs] No hurry, we'll hole up for the winter. You'll tell me. - I'm no use to you. - And we've got till May 4th. [object thuds] Let's get some heat in here. [object clattering] - You can't keep me here like this. They'll find me. My uncle is a very important man. There'll be an outcry. It'll be on the newspapers with my picture, "Politician's niece abduced." - Abducted. - All the police will be looking for me, [Andrej chuckles] and the Air Force, and the Army with helicopters. Oh, well. - Trout. [water splashing] Now, I like mine grilled on the bone, with a little parsley and lemon. [water splashing] That one was yours. [crackling] They keep a real fine cellar here. This is from Levallois. That's a good French wine. Oughta remind you of home, hmm? Do you want some? - No, thank you. - You know, I like France. I've traveled all around it. Normandy, Brittany, crossed the Camard. [bottle clattering] - Following someone, I suppose? - I had a girl with me. [cork pops] - How wonderful for her. - Yes, I think it was. [glass clanking] - I'm sure you're a great lover, especially with [speaks indistinctly]. - I'm very particular. They have to be awake. [clattering] - With you, I would find it hard to be awake. - You've had a lot of experience, huh? [metal clanging] - Enough. - Say, tell me, you know when your husband was arrested on your honeymoon, was it before? After? During? - Our marriage was consumed. - Ah, thank God it wasn't consummated. - You have a dirty mind. - Well, that's better than having a clean record. - I have not got a clean record! I have had many lovers. - How many? - 87. - Name the last two. - I can't remember names [chuckles]. Anyway, it was hours ago. - You better clean up now, and get your mind off sex. [Fabienne imitates blabbering noises] - You're such a child. - I am not a child! I'm a woman with a will of my own, a strong will. I am very determined. I am getting up now, and I'm leaving, and nothing is going to stop me, especially you! [footsteps thudding] [door clatters] [door slams] [footsteps thudding] - What's the matter? - It's raining. [rain pattering] [crickets chirping] [footsteps thudding] [fire crackles] I'm not sleeping in here with you! - Sleep in there and freeze to death. - I'd rather do that than, than- - Than, than what? A girl with your experience, hey, I can be number 88. [clattering] We could be nice and warm. You'd only have one bed to make up in the morning. Hmm? [Andrej laughing] Good night, Mrs. Fenton. [fire crackling] [mellow instrumental music] [door creaks] [door creaks] [water splashing] Hey! [Fabienne yells] [water splashing] [boat clatters] You forgot something. - I've forgotten you! [oars clattering] [Andrej chuckles] [water splashing] - Good try, but don't try it again. Sorry about keeping you here, but it's up to you. [fire crackling] [quirky instrumental music] [birds chirping] [wood cracking] [clattering] [Fabienne groans] [mellow instrumental music] - Truce? - Suffering from shock and exposure? - I'm suffering from something. [glass clinking] - Oh, yes. Of course it's been hours since you took a lover. - Days. [liquid sloshing] - This much of a truce? [glasses clinking] [liquid sloshing] [furniture creaking] [glasses clinking] [mellow jazz music] Why? - Don't ask questions. Not now. [mellow jazz music] [quirky instrumental music] [furniture creaking] - Geez, I can see the headlines now, "Politician's niece abduced." [rustling] What's the matter? - Nothing. - Why are you shaking? - I'm shaking nothing. I'm just cold. - Yeah? Nervous? [Fabienne giggles] - I'm not nervous, I'm just cold. - Well, why'd you move your bed from the fireplace? Stay right where you are. [objects clattering] [thudding] [furniture creaking] Better? - Mm-hmm, much. - You know, we could be friends. I'd like that. We've told each other a lot of lies, but that isn't. [mellow jazz music] [gentle instrumental music] [intense crashing] [Andrej yells] [thudding] [water dripping] [eerie dramatic music] - That was an even better try, hmm? [Andrej laughs] - You never give up. - I have now. [cork squeaks] - Why? - Things have changed. - Is that why you came back, hmm? Truce? - What about truth? - Yeah, I guess it's about time I started telling you the truth. [engine whirs] [tires crunching] [car doors slam] [door closes softly] [metal clanging] [object clattering] [footsteps thudding] [groans] [intense dramatic music] [engine revs] [thudding] No, you don't. [engine revving] [tires crunching] [intense dramatic music] [engine roars] [metal clatters] - 55 pence, please. - Here you are. Keep the change, - Oh. - And could we leave now please? - We'd better just wait for those two men running down the hill. - We're in an awful hurry. - They're in a hurry as well. - Please, it's very urgent. - Oh, why didn't you say so? [metal creaking and clattering] [heavy breathing] [motor whirring] [water splashing] [motor rumbling] - Why did those men want you? - Well, first of all, let me tell you, I'm not a spy. No, you see what I do, is I smuggle manuscripts out of Russia, you know, political memoirs, novels. Works that are banned by the Soviets, I help to get them published in the West. - Is that what you put in my case? - Yes. - The whole manuscript? - Well, on microfilm, of course. - Why? - Well, I'd thought they'd caught me in Bucharest with a hotel full of Secret Police. Well, how did I know they were there to arrest your husband? - Why didn't you tell me that before? What you do is- - Make money. I'm not a boy scout doing good deeds. I get paid very, very well, or I used to. [Fabienne gasps and moans] Now, what's your angle? - I thought you were a spy, you see? That's why I pretended to have what you wanted. I was going to get you arrested and swapped for John. [Andrej laughs] - Don't worry about it. How can you get me arrested? I'm not a spy. - You may be now. [engine rumbling] [footsteps thudding] [doorbell buzzing] [knocking at door] [door clatters] [Fabienne sighs] - Oh, it's you. - Baxter, I must know, did you do it? - Well, you see, the thing is, my mother came down last Tuesday, and she's not been at all well. She's had this thing right down her side, me aunt. She's not really me aunt, but that's what we call her, and it was the night porter. - Did you or didn't you? - No. - You didn't. - My nerves saved me. If you never speak to me again, I don't blame you. I've let you down. I'm pathetic. - Of course you're not. You're wonderful. - Am I? - Baxter? - Oh. Did I interrupt something? Who is she? - One of the net ball players. We were just about to kick off. [Fabienne giggles] - I'll go. Goodnight. [door slams] - Who was that? - Pardon? - Who was that? - Yesterday's woman. [dramatic instrumental music] - Hey, now, look. You do not have to stay. You are a woman with a will of your own, and very determined. Ah, you're getting up now and leaving? Nothing's gonna stop you, especially me. [Andrej clears throat] - But it may be raining. [Andrej laughs] [gentle instrumental music] [door clatters] - Andrej Sterrans? - What do you mean barging in here? - You're under arrest. - How can they arrest an innocent man? It's as bad as over there. The Secret Police barge in in the middle of the night. - We don't have Secret Police. We have the Special Branch. - Demand to do the same thing. - Fabienne, evidence was found in his room, conclusive evidence that the man's a Soviet agent. - Planted evidence. Uncle, isn't it obvious? That's why the Russians got him out of the way. I was with him. We were forced to go to Scotland. - Good grief, girl. The Russian Embassy's already admitted that he's a spy. - But that's because they want him. I've told you what he does. - Proof positive, and don't go on about that story of lost luggage. I'm going to read the sporting page. - Morning, Trevor. Morning, Fabienne. Splendid news. - What? - Chap we arrested last night. The Russians have agreed to swap him for John. [sighing] - No. - Why ever not? This man means nothing to us. - Just a man. [sighing] [somber orchestral music] [engine rumbling] - That means the bloody ice has melted. That's something. - There he is. - Still don't like the fella. Still looks too smooth. - Look! John's suitcase, - Huh? - I forgot there was another one. He must've taken it to Moscow. You put all my clothing in that suitcase. Don't you see? Soon they'll [indistinct], they'll know who you are. - When the case is here, I'll be there. - You must be the first Soviet prisoner to put on weight. When they take the photographs, suck your cheeks in. - Come along, sir. [engine rumbling] - Andrej, you must do something. - Nothing I can do. Wheels in motion. Don't you want John back? - Yes, of course I do. - But for the reason and for the right man. - Welcome home, comrade. - Yeah. Great to be back. [engine rumbling] - Welcome home, sir. - Oh, good to be back. What have I missed? - Oh nothing much really, sir. Weather's been pretty off in England. Oh, Princess Anne's taking her pilot's license. [engine rumbling] - Good to catch you, comrade. - But you didn't get the manuscript. - But we stopped the flow. - I must tell you, only in self-preservation, that at this very moment the manuscript is making its way toward the West with my file. Here he comes. - What are you talking about? - Fenton was my partner and he has the manuscript in that case. - Ridiculous. - He's made quite a fool of you. - Absurd. - Worth a look? - Stop! - Pardon? - Stop! [engine rumbling] Open the case. - I can't open the case. You know why, - Open it. - I'm sorry, this isn't on my operational schedule. - Why don't you open the case? - John's case is full of money. What does it mean? - What the hell's going on? Close it up, please. - What does this mean? - Means the exchange is off. - Take him back. - I'm afraid it means he's being paid for his hardship, unless he's done an awful lot of overtime in the salt mines. - Mmmm. [speaking foreign language] - Sorry about this, sir. Appears to be some sort of hitch. [engine rumbling] - I really must protest. I'm in- [screaming] [quirky orchestral music] [engine rumbling] - Get after them. He's just around. - Get after who? We'll sort it out when we get there. [suspenseful orchestral music] [man shouting indistinctly] [man shouting indistinctly] [engine rumbling] [grunting] [engine rumbling] [grunting] [grunting] [man shouting indistinctly] [engine rumbling] [suspenseful orchestral music] - Oh thank God, thank God. [sighing] Oh my God. [suspenseful orchestral music] [grunting] - Nice of you to drop in. - Got a lot of spirit, that girl. - Must be English. [suspenseful orchestral music] [engine rumbling] - Look out! [all shouting] [explosion booming] [all chattering] [all chattering] [engine rumbling] [man shouting] [man speaking foreign language] [gun firing] [dramatic orchestral music] [engine rumbling] [Fabienne shouting indistinctly] [engine rumbling] - Getting away and it's all your fault. How could you ever marry a guy like that in the first place? What the hell are you doing? No time for fireworks. Oh, you can't hit 'em with that. That's used for distress signals. Don't you understand? It's a flare gun. - What? - Don't point it at me. Point it at him. Now look what the hell you're doing, you dummy. [explosion booming] [engine rumbling] - I got him, I got him! [grunting] - Here, take this. - But how does it work? [engine rumbling] [coughing] [groaning] - Just take that. - Help. [screaming] [engine rumbling] [light jazz music] - Come on, we better get back. I think you've lost a husband. - You've lost a manuscript. - Eh, it wasn't much of a book. - He wasn't much of a husband. I wonder what they'll do with him. - Depends on who they are. Wait a minute. Which bank are we are on? - The West of course. - Sure? - Oh, naturally. It's obvious. - I hope you're right because if you're not the whole thing starts all over again. Double. - Halt! [Fabienne gasping] - You are sure this is the West? [chuckling] - Of course. - Mmm, okay. [light orchestral music] [dreamy chiming music]
