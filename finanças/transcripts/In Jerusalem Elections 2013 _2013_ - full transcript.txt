- Okay this is different kinds of flags which I found in different kinds of locations. This flag I think was from an operation we had in a place known as The Village of Kabatiya where we had to go inside the village and arrest terrorists and terrorist supporters. I found-- What's it stand for? - This, you can more or less understand from the rifles and flags and, once again, you can see the more or less the map of Israel, the green thing in the middle that they see the entire country as their own. I have here a more interesting flag. What is this? Oh yeah this is like a scarf that tie up here. Mostly they tie it on their children because you know when they teach them to hate one very small so it stucks, so a kind of psychological effect. Obviously claims for independence and it's more than legitimate for any nation to have their own country and have independence. I think if I remember this is like an improvised rocket they tried to fire on us. What about the ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel? - They don't really work, they don't pay taxes, they don't actually, they don't go into the army service, they don't really do anything but just, you know, take more, more, and more, and more money. And have extremely great political influence for some weird reason I can't understand. So tell us about the election. - Oh what can I tell you about the elections? Everybody thinks that Bibi Netanyahu is gonna win, again, because nobody else seems to be able to lead the country right now. House prices is one of the big issues in Jerusalem today. All young people, when they get married, want to buy a house and the house prices have risen so much in the last very few years, that nobody can afford to buy one anymore, it's one of the main issues is the fact that the middle classes have so little buying power anymore. And it's one of the big issues in the election now. About house prices and the price of other things too. Generally speaking, every Israeli supports the building of the wall because it protects them and it makes them feel safer from terrorist attacks. On the other hand, all the Arabs are against the wall because it excludes them and it stops them from coming into Israel legally or illegally to work, which is very important to them because there are very, very few jobs available in their local areas. - This is being broadcasted in the Shuk Mahane Yehuda in Jerusalem, Israel. - Only Bibi because I love Bibi, Bibi is good for Israel. Every, every, Europe is down for the money. Bibi brings up. In Israel, everything good. Look in Spain, look in Greece, look in everywhere, it's not good, but in Israel, it's very good. Look everyone-- - Even America knows we want Bibi. Can you bring details of the truth? - I can, most of the time. Especially to Obama. Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom. - Shalom, shabbat shalom. - You want to know about the elections. So I'm also confused because I'm, I'm 50 years old but I'm confused but I know who I'm gonna vote for. Um, I'm religious and I'm going to vote for the Jewish House. We want more Jewish and more tradition to be in Israel, that it will not be forgotten. Like what, give me an example. - All the Jewish tradition that goes with us 2000 years, all the things we have and we have a very Jewish, a very rich Jewish culture and I think that education of the religious people is something very... it's high, high moral and not to be like all the world, to be unique. I am a Palestinian. You consider yourself Palestinian? - Yeah. What do you think about the Israeli elections? We don't care about it at all actually. Is there a reason for that? - Of course, there's a lot of reasons. First of all, we are live under occupation. About the governments, they are our enemies. They never treat us as it should be. Even, at least, at least through the useless nation rules, I mean United Nations, I call it useless nation. You see. Actually, no justice. Do you believe that Palestinians should have their own state? - No, to have the state, we have many, many, we have long wait actually. First of all, we don't have the basic to create a state. Or does somebody think we have a state? Okay, then mention it in United Nation. But instead of a state, what is it? Nothing. What we have, everything controlled by the occupiers. We live under occupation. In Ramallah or Nablus, Gaza Strip, everywhere. We are surrounded completely. It's a huge cage. The history repeated itself. What the Nazi they did, against the Jews, as here the Israeli government, they did it against the Palestinians. At the moment, are there any parties which tell the truth? - Politician? This is a new word was call it politician but the origin of the name is Polchik. They are liars! They say low, which low? Low to me, low. It mean low. They are liars. Show me any politician or any responsible person, get into the elections and he make his promises, not just here in the country. All over the world and one of them he kept 10 percent of his promises. No one. They run after their interests and then they tell you 'Sorry dear, go fuck yourself.' I reached a point and he is ready to throw on you the first one. - I think that Israel right now is pretty much in same place as government of Iran and the people of Iran, meaning that there is very very far bridge, there's not even bridge, there is huge gap between the government and the people themselves. What is more important, security or the economy? - I don't think it should be two different questions. I think that if you make a maintainable peace process and peace treaty with Palestinians, through negotiation of course, not unilateral action, then you get a strong economy because you can open up markets to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and people there want to buy Israel product just like we want to, we want to consume their products. I think there is a strong possibility for a new economy in the Middle East based on mutual respect. Because if you sign a good treaty, when I mean good, I say that the Palestinians can live with, you also signed an Arab initiative with 22 other nations. Even Syria is signed on that. That if you sign a peace treaty with Palestinians, Israel can keep the Golan Heights and you have 28 million people more on your border that you can barter with, you can trade with, you can do business with. You can buy oil. We pay four times the amount for oil than our border, than our next door neighbor Jordan for the same amount of oil. Why do we do that? Why not just buy oil from Saudi Arabia? We're that close. Why should we get our oil from America or from Finland? Heaven knows why. - The salaries are not high enough in order to even pay for your basic needs, basic lively goods, hardly covers the bills and the rent, and the bills keep getting higher and higher. No one actually even bothers about the question of who will be a good Prime Minister, all we're bothering, all we're thinking about is who do we want to go into the Parliament and who would be good to be in a coalition, what parties. But to think of a head, um, I'm really not sure that we have a good, um, not really amongst the candidates for that now. Tell us about the story when you lived in Jerusalem working with Palestinians. - Uh, about 10 years ago I was living in Jerusalem working in a restaurant and I met and worked a lot with Palestinians. It always struck me as amazing how their lives, how much different their lives were from mine. I mean, we used to share our food and laugh and what you do with your colleagues and then I hear about how it took them four or five hours to get into Jerusalem from Ramallah because of checkpoints and uh, and uh what really stuck in my mind, how whenever we started to talk about politics or their lives or the situation between Israelis and Palestinians, they would say, uh, 'Oh, don't worry there will be another war,' and 'We'll kill you all, there's gonna be blood up to here,' and they were serious when they said it. And one of them was very religious as well. And right after that we'd sit down and have lunch together that they made and we'd still be friends, but there was all this unbridgeable abyss between us. And that really illustrated to me the complexity of this, of the conflict. Actually the other cook used to be a journalist and they told me about all of their family members who were injured or died, it was the days of Second Intifada and so, yeah this is very sad. Do you think the rich should be taxed more? - The rich will be taxed more? First of all, the rich, it is not logic, I mean, it is a kind of populism. Not so many rich people here and if they, people that have fortune, the fortune will be taxed, the fortune will leave the country. And if what Shelia Chamovitz says in a populist way that she will tax the companies, that is completely idiot because the companies, the money do not go to the owners of the companies, if the company, if the money remains in the company, that is very good because the company have to invest the money in the creation of workplaces so she will take this money to the government. And then she will give it back to the companies in order to create work. That's stupid. In a religious street about, very religious street, woman are not wearing trousers, pants. Uh and cars are not driving Saturday, so if they take over here, this area, my wife will not be able to dress the way she dresses and I will not be able to go to, to my orienteering sport the way I did this morning by car. That is sudden danger to our way of life and I am, in a way, afraid and worried that maybe within 40 years or 50 years my grandchildren will live in a different country. Struggle is about ideas, about ideologies. Are you gonna be voting in this election? - No. Why not? - Because I don't like politics, that's it. Do you want to see Israel, um, improve its relations with Arab countries? - No. I don't believe. Why? - Because this is a big lie, okay. Like after all these years, and it's history, about the wars between Palestinians and us. Suddenly everything's gonna be fine and peace? Look, they divided they're two different countries now. For me, when we were occupied for example, when used to live in Ramallah or something in the West Bank, everything was fine. There were no walls, nothing, dividing two countries. It's making, it's making this Jewish and, even more difficult so I don't believe. It's a dream. I don't believe there's something called peace between both countries. It's through for me and it's a long history story so. Do you think Israel should improve its relations with other Arab countries such as Syria, Jordan, or even know you, Saudi Arabia? - I don't think that, uh, I don't think that there are any, that this is gonna happen because Israel is dreaming of being, you know, the strongest country in the Middle East or something, if not the whole world, okay, and They don't do anything, they don't plan for anything except for their own benefit, that's it. They don't, like, they don't even dream of peace because they're peaceful okay, because they have certain benefits. Do you believe there can be peace for the Israelis? - No, I don't believe. - Like Obama says, vote. Don't hate, just vote. Are you gonna be voting? - I'm not gonna tell you who I'll vote for, but I'm going to be voting. And I suggest every Israeli vote. Do you think Israeli Arabs should go to the army? - I think they should do service to help their people. I think they should do things that will be constructive. I don't think we should give them guns. That would be a very dangerous thing to do. Why? Why? What do you mean why? These people threatened to kill us. Do you wanna see some videos of it? Give me an example. - Okay, they raise their children saying that they should go, that children should sacrifice their life to kill a Jew. Every day we're learning these things, every day we see these things. And you want to give them a gun? No, not in my life. Is that Arab Israelis in Israel who-- - What? Excuse me. What? Is that Arabs who are Israeli citizens? - Also sure, of course it is. Go look in the ones who have been locked up for terrorism. They brag about murdering Jews. Do you think Shelia Yermalovich, I think that's her name, can be a good Prime Minister? She's a labor, left-wing centrist. - No, of course not. They think that you can give land for peace. I think we should give peace for peace. I read and someone told me, that if you give each household 500,000 dollars, it may be possible but the problem is many Arabs may not want or Palestinians may not accept it. - So first take the ones that will go. And then let's deal with the other ones. But when they see that the other ones are having a good life somewhere else, they'll wanna go too. They want a good life is what they want. How do you feel about an Arab moving and living next door? - I live next door to Arabs for 26 years. Next, the wall, the other side they live. These particular Arabs are very nice people. But on my street, I'm very leery about who I bump into. When I walked home two nights ago, an Arab young man grabbed my beard in the market. Now that's not a friendly, nice thing to do, is it? I don't know who the boy was. Now what happens if you report that to the police? I mean, they've got cameras all over the place. - Yeah, what happens? They'll say don't go there anymore. But you live there. That's right. Aren't the neighborhoods segregated? - What? No segregated, they live wherever they want. Can you live wherever you want? - I bought a home from a Jewish person who bought it from a Jewish person. Which parties tell the truth and why? - Which parties? Politicians are not known for telling the truth, no matter what party they're in. And which party lie the most? - Which party what? Which parties lie the most in your opinion? - I've never counted all the lies. Politicians don't tell the truth, everybody knows that. Can you tell us, do you think the rich should be taxed more? - I think that the tax system should be fair. I don't believe in raising more taxes for wealthy people. I think work, constructive, productive work, should be provided and, for instance here in Israel if they would make more land available for more Jewish housing, that would lower the price of the houses and that would stir up a lot of commercial business in the building trade and people buying homes. How do you think this can be done? - What's the problem? The government just has to say okay, you can build here. The land's here. Yeah obviously the big issue is with the land. - But you have the Jewish land. God gave it to us. When you go abroad, do people ever question your beliefs in terms of the land belonging to the Jews? - Of course they do. Wherever you go people, it depends on where you're going. It depends on where you go and who the people are. Most of the world likes to buy Arab propaganda. Do you think there should be non-religious civil marriage in Israel? - For the non-Jewish people, definitely. And then for Jewish people? - Jewish people should get married in a kosher holy way. I don't believe in legislating religion. That's my own belief. Now most religious people say they should do that. I think it's my job to bring them in and show them how this is a better way to do things, better for them, better for their children and their family. Some people want separation between religion and state. - Most countries in the world, other than Arab countries. Now let's say you wanna go over to Saudi Arabia. Huh, and you asked that question. They'd pull out a knife! What are you trying to do? There's no freedom in any Arab country where the Arabs are in charge. Not on any matters. The women are not even allowed to drive a car! But this doesn't bother you for some reason. But if we say that you have to get married, Jews have to marry Jews in a kosher way, for some reason you feel that limits our, limits people's freedom. So you're saying it's similar to some elements in Arab society? - What? Are you similar in some Arab-- - No, not similar at all. We're not, we're not killing people. We're not cutting off people's heads. Are you reading the newspapers? Okay. So in short, you do believe religion should have an influence over the state? - I think that it's up to the religious people to influence the nonreligious people in a loving, intelligent way. As I said, I don't believe in legislating religion. See I grew up in America where there's a separation to some degree between religion and state. Could we change? - Are you asking if this is the best form of government? I mean, elections for Prime Minister. - This is the only free country in the Middle East and people are peacefully voting in governments. All the other countries are coming with wars. And you're asking us if we should change? I think you should ask them if they should change. If they want to change the government, how do they do it? They start a war. If we want to change the government, we vote for somebody else, right? Is that true? Some Israeli Arabs say that they feel that they don't have full equality here in Israeli society. - That's what they feel because they wanna teach you that, however if they were in any other Arab country, they'd have less. They'd have shorter life spans, go look it up, I'm not making these things up. They'd have a lower standard of living. Look up the facts, because you're just buying what somebody else told you. They can vote if they want, but they don't wanna vote. So they're not voting. They have people that can exit. There are Arabs in the government. There are Arab policemen. There are Bedouin soldiers. If they want, they can contribute and they can cooperate. You said that he thinks that he's being discriminated against because it costs him five times as much to pay for 100 square meters in the city than if it were sold to Jewish people. He thinks that the garbage is not being collected properly, there should be garbage places for-- - And you believe him right? You think he's telling you the truth. Now the taxes on my apartment are almost twice the taxes of the apartment next door because they're Arabs and we're Jews. So this is called the Jewish home in the Jewish quarter, and right, the next house over, that's called the Arab quarter and the taxes are much, much, much lower. Now is that fair? I pay 100 dollars, 125 dollars a month, and all I get from the city are lights at night and take out the garbage. That's a lot of money. Are you saying that you are made to pay more? - I pay much more than they are. Of course, it's a known thing. They pay lower, it's called arnona, the tax. Where is this, is this on the website? - Go to Arnona and see what the different rates are in the old city. And you'll see that the Jewish quarter is about twice as high as the other quarters. So you're telling me that many of the, what Arabs and Palestinians say are blatant lies? Of course, it's a known thing. Are you that naive? Well I think if you would check and do some research, especially before you interview, half the interview you would not have had to ask. Especially the secular Jews, they live just to try to change many things for the country. - And so do the nonreligious trying to dictate many things for the country, that's not new. They want their program put in effect and these people want their program put in effect. Do you think the negative press about Israel is a form of media antisemitism? - Of course it is. But you know what? God sends it to us, because when people hate us, we get stronger, we come together. And when people are nice to us, we disappear. So God sends us these people to hate us. That's a known thing. Goes all the way back to the history of Egypt, 3000 years ago. The more they hit us, the more we multiply. I mean, some people might see that as being racist. Have you ever been to an Islamic country? Huh? I've been to no place else. - Okay, if you go to an Islamic country, you're not allowed any other belief. You're not allowed, I mean, they're coming to England now, did you see the video now on England where they have Muslim patrols walking down the street telling non-Muslims not to drink alcohol and making them put their drinks down? These are YouTube videos now. When they come to your neighborhood, you let me know about it, okay? Okay, have a good life. About 15 years ago, maybe it was 20, the Swedish newspaper interviewed me. For half an hour, we walked all through the old city and I answered all their questions. Then he asked me, well what should we do about the Arabs. I said, well they should live in peace. He said, what if they don't wanna live in peace? What if they want war? I said then we should be very tough with these Arabs. He took the 30 minute interview and all he showed was me saying we have to be tough with these Arabs. I have it on film at my house if you wanna see it. Please don't do that to this. Are you an Israeli? - Yes, of course. Do you wanna sit there? - Is my daughter, she's my daughter. - I'm his daughter. Can I ask you the questions? Maybe you can sit there too. Yeah, okay, yeah. Where are you from? - From the BBC? I'm freelance. - I've been at the House of Common in time of fear. I met with the Lord when they shoot the first bullet into Iraq and they took to them. - Okay. - And then in America, 26 time and I've been in 44 states in America. - Okay. - No passport. - No passport? - Without any passport? - No. He's writing a documentary. - Oh. Let's go on to different themes. What do you people think of Netanyahu? Is he gonna solve the Palestinian and Israeli conflicts? - Who knows? No one would still have a problem here. All of them are same. - No one, yes. - All of them are same. Only one, God, aw United States of America. But as long as the capital head in United States has occupation from the Jewish lobby, you don't disrupt anything. Obama is no interesting story. - No, no Obama nothing, all of them are bullshit. You know who is a good statesman? Me and you. - It's very, very clear that the Israelis failed, the Arabs failed, the Christians failed to up themselves from such conflict. We keep forgetting that we are human beings and not this or that. - Yes, my name is Columbo. I believe in lotto, not in direction. Just lotto in my life. Hello? Hello. Okay, I want to go to Tel Aviv to Ben Gurion Airport, yes. Come outside. Um, excuse me, I don't know. Hello? You go to the airport? Yes, yes, I am, my name is Roberto. In this moment we are in Jerusalem. - One, two, mm.
