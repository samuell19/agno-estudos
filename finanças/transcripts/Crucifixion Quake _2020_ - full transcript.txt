You get up in the morning, you're thinking about your high school friend from 20 years ago or your college friend, and you wake up and that's all you can think about is like gosh I wonder how so-and-so's doing, I haven't seen her in years, I'd love to see her. And you go to work, and you get out of your car, and you're walking down the street, and you turn the corner and there she is. That would be a situation where these two people had connected at one point in their lives and then they separated, and then suddenly they met in a very meaningful way at a time when something very meaningful was happening perhaps. Why did you wake up thinking about that person? Are you responsible for that happening or is there some benevolent force that is somehow making that happen in order to do something for you. I'm certain that everybody thinks I'm obsessed, maybe. But I don't care what that looks like from the outside. I know it's been 20 years but I'm close now, I really am. I always ask myself what happens after I die? And then something happened. Something happened that made me realize we all need to know this. We all need to know this badly, since then I just couldn't stop. The last time I almost died was over 20 years ago, 1996. But I didn't die. I was supposed to be on that flight. John and Charlie were on that flight. They were dead like everybody else but I was alive, my life had been spared and I didn't know why. They were better than me. John was young, Charlie left two kids. Why them? I feel guilty. They're the ones who should still be alive. Here I was still in this world when I was supposed to be gone, what does that mean? Was I born again? Was this my baptism? I don't know but since then everything changed. From now on I needed to find a purpose for my existence. I need to do something that wasn't just about me. I was determined to remember this not to let it slip away within a week when my life went back to normal because this is what we do. We're distracted, not paying attention, not open to see whatever's waiting for us. We just keep going with our lives. And this is what happened to me. But looking back I know now that my life changed on that flight. I called my parents, I told them, "I wasn't on the flight that crashed." I hung up and I thought about myself. I had to find meaning for my life. I did read it once, it was about 20 years ago. I remember the night I got to Matthew. Now from the six hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour, and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit, and behold the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom and the earth shook and the rocks were split. When the centurion and those who were who were with him keeping watch over Jesus saw the earthquake and what took place they were filled with awe and said, "Truly this was the Son of God." This is a vivid description of an earthquake. I'm a geologist so everything became clear, from that moment I had a goal. - The Bible isn't a scientific book, it is a book that tells us not how things happened by why, which is probably more important so it's a book of faith. And read in that context so it's a story of salvation God's love for humanity. - You know when you ask what is the Bible, it's not an easy question because you got Jews who would say, "It's the Old Testament." Of course they don't call it the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Bible. Christians have also the New Testament, which is an additional 27 books that they put together. And there are other religious traditions, Roman Catholics have an additional 14 books they call the Apocrypha. - The New Testament is basically the story of Christ. You have the Four Gospels giving us the words and the deeds of Jesus written down obviously not at the time but afterward. Then you have the Book of Acts, then you have the various letters, and then you have the final book the Book of Apocalypse or Revelation. - The Gospels don't tell four entirely different stories about Jesus, they tell the same story in four different ways. Why four? It's rather like having four portraits of the same person because a portrait brings out some characteristics of an individual but it can't bring out every characteristic. And so Christians have said, "That it takes Four Gospels to tell the one Gospel of Jesus Christ." The crucifixion is the part of the story of Jesus's life in which the Four Gospels are more closely aligned in their narrative similarities than in any other place. The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, top to bottom. This was the Son of God. - According to Luke, and to Mark, and to Matthew all of them say, "That at the death of Jesus the temple curtain was torn." - That's in Mark, Matthew repeats it, Luke repeats it but normally that's understand as in the temple if you go inside the outer chamber the holy room there is a curtain. But Josephus tells us, this is the Jewish historian of the period who knew, and lived, and saw the temple that there was another curtain, a huge curtain that was probably 30 feet across, very heavy that was in front outside the temple complex. - Inner curtain and outer curtain, the curtain was ripped, well doesn't say which one. The significance though it says, "From top to bottom." means they were not done by a human hand, is that now because of Jesus's death the barrier between God and humanity is now gone. - When we look at Mark's description of the tearing of the temple curtain the centurion who's standing by sees all of these events and declares, "Now that was the Son of God." The only tearing of the temple curtain you could see from Golgotha would be the giant 80 foot really public curtain. - So the question is is it a theology point the blood of Christ is now covering our sins, is that Mark means or does he have some memory right as Jesus died of this huge curtain somehow being torn? But the only think that could tear the huge curtain in the front of the temple would possibly be a seismic event. - The Gospel of Matthew adds a new accent to that story that Mark and Luke don't have. And Matthew's accent is that there was also an earthquake. - Now that's a real problem because if all we had was Matthew I would completely dismiss it as embellishment, theological exaggeration, theological embellishment, making it more supernatural because that's what he does throughout. Mark doesn't say there as an earthquake but he does say, "That the veil of temple was rent." Now if he saying that big outer curtain was rent then you got an earthquake in Mark as well. But he doesn't use the word earthquake. - Because of that article I lost my reputation, my colleagues were worried about their reputation. Scientist don't like their integrity questioned and that article questioned it in a very substantial way because it strongly implied that my colleagues and I were trying to prove the Bible. So after the news article came out nobody wanted to work with me, nobody returned my calls. 13 years of developing contacts went down the drain in the 48 hours it took that article to go viral. I had to swallow a lot of things in my life. And right now I feel like a failure. But I'm not going down without a fight. I'm going back to the Dead Sea, there's more work for me to do there. I don't know if this is my last chance to figure this story out but it sure feels like it. I better be ready. I know everybody thought I wanted to prove what happened at the crucifixion and that article was a result but that's not what I did. It's more complicated than that. I have to go back more than 20 years to explain what I did. It all started the night I read Matthew. - When you are passionate about something that fills you with joy and excitement, and motivation it awakens you to possibilities that you didn't know existed, to a purpose or a meaning that you didn't have before. It's as if the universe is conspiring to help you. This has been the intuition of mystics, spirit people around the year for hundreds of years, you can say thousands of years. There's tradition for that belief. Some people say, "Well, it was my purpose, I couldn't help it, I had to do that, it's what I was born for." It's like you have spiritual awakening in a way, not in any traditional sense about any traditional God image but you're having a spiritual experience. When I first read that account in Matthew I thought this could be studied but not by me. I wasn't an earthquake geologist, not yet. I didn't have the skills and I didn't feel confident. I wanted to pass the idea on to someone with those skills. I thought they would jump to study such an earthquake as it's in the middle of the most influential story in human history but they weren't interested. I was shocked by their indifference. But someone gave me a name. Someone was already studying the earthquake history of the Dead Sea. So in 1999 I made my first trip to the Dead Sea and I spoke to Amotz Agnon of Hebrew University He told me, "There was evidence of an earthquake from 33 A.D. in the sediments in the Dead Sea. Revital Bookman was working in Nahal Zeelim, Claudia Migowski was working in Ein Gedi, and Elisa Kagan would later work in Ein Feshka. Their advisors were Moti Stein and Amotz Agnon. - Paleoseismic studies started in Zeelim under PhD work of Revital Bookman. We were interested in this research because we found we can date earthquakes that happen in prehistorical times, which is exactly what Revital did. - When you look at the walls of the gullies you see mostly horizontal layers, very thin layers, which we call lamina. And every once and a while you see that some of them are not horizontal and they're actually quite deformed, mixed up, or folded in different ways. - We see the disassembly, instead of the layers are looking like this flat, right, and we have beautiful laminated sections that are not disturbed, we have disturbances like pressures that we see fragments of layers within other layers, and we see folds and this kind of stuff. - And this indicates that at the time when these layers were actually on the lake bottom something happened to them. - And our interpretation this all is related to earthquake activity. - These deformations were caused by earthquakes. - Later on Claudia Migowski worked on the drill in Ein Gedi so she got really most of the story. - This was extremely successful so in Ein Gedi probably covered 20 meters... - Most of the paleoseismic studies in the world are done on cores. When people started studying these lake sediments here only a few meters were exposed in the river beds and in order to get view of the entire Holocene the best way to do it was to drill cores into the shores. They didn't even have to go into the lake, they drilled the cores on the shores of the Dead Sea. - The idea with the core is that you are limited to a very narrow width of a few centimeters the holes that you stick in the ground gives you. - Even when Revital started working they were working in very, very small narrow lake beds with just you know a few meters of exposures and as time went by the lake, the Dead Sea has been going down and the rivers have been incising more and more and the river bed walls exposures have been getting deeper and deeper. - The valley now is something like 10 meters, the wall is 10 meters wide. At that time was less than four meters. - I don't know if this is a true story but the Zeelim Gully where most of my work was done and a lot of us were he could just jump over from one side to the other. - We could jump, we could jump from one side of the valley, it wasn't a valley, it was just a trench like this. - However the most drastic and very, very quick lake level drop has been happening the past 10's of years up until today and and still the lake level's dropping more than a meter a year and doesn't seem to be stopping. - Today the Dead Sea is at 432 meters below sea level, so when you stand now in the Dead Sea just imagine there was a lake that its surface elevation was 250 meters above your head. Let me repeat it, you stand now on the shores of the Dead Sea and the surface of that lake was 250 meters above your head. - Recently obviously it's been going down, down, down therefore the lake sediments are now exposed in many places. Elisa Kagan moved in working in Ein Feshka, which turn out to have many more seismites so this give a whole new dimension. - What I mostly did was study the exposures. The advantage of an exposure is that instead of just having a few centimeters of view you have a very large view of what you're looking at. You can choose where you wanna work. It's much easier to find material for dating when you have a core that's only this thin you have to get pretty lucky. The exposures, the geological lake bed exposures in the geologist field is becoming more and more available to us. There's almost no need in the Holocene to look at the cores if you wanna look at the lake margin. - And this was actually the beginning of the saga that continues now for more than 25 years. - I went to the Dead Sea to look for evidence of the earthquake. I looked everywhere for days, I couldn't find it. I went back the next year in 2000, I still couldn't find it. They were studying all the earthquakes that could be seen but all I cared about was this one earthquake. I don't know if they liked that. Plenty of people are going to the Holy Land to try to prove the Bible. I think they were afraid that I was one of them. I felt like they were keeping me at arm's length. Someone even told me I wasn't allowed to study this but I wouldn't listen. You're gonna need a lot more than that to stop me. But still I couldn't find it. I felt like an idiot. I came back again in 2001 and this time I begged Amotz for help. He helped me. Nobody's helped me more than Amotz over the last 20 years. He arranged for his PhD student Revital to meet me the field and she showed it to me in Nahal Zeelim there it was, right in front of me. I started to work on it. I still felt inadequate but if nobody else was gonna study this it had to be me. I took a deep dive into radiocarbon dating, which is how you dated the earthquakes. You took pieces of old plants lying at different depths in a section and ya sent them to the lab. The lab results and subsequent analysis told you the approximate age when that depth of sediments was deposited. - Revital and Elisa were my students, my PhD students and so they came with the data and we interpreted it. - We could recover the entire Holocene period, which is the past 10,000 years. And they identified at least for the past 2,00 years so even more, all the historical aspects. In our... the first layer that is not disrupted was deposited immediately after the event. Then we can say something about the year or perhaps the season when the ground shaking event happened. Basically the best way to date them is using carbon-14, go in the field look at the area, look at the layers that we wanna date and we can go along the exposures until we find small twigs, seeds, logs, any kind of organic material that we can find in there. The sampling for radiocarbon is done in the field when you recognize without contaminating it with your fingers or anything you pull it out with tweezers and you keep it in a aluminum foil. Problem with dating recently with radiocarbon is that radiocarbon is not sufficiently accurate. There are calibration issues that give you a range of dates. - Radiocarbon dating method like everything in science has its limitation. When we go through the past 2,000 years we have all this arguments but then we have the dating because we are dating the earth and then we can compare them to the historical documents. The geologist were using what was known as earthquake catalogs or historical catalogs to know when and where an earthquake was reported. I had never heard about these catalogs before. Like everybody else I assumed that they were correct because historians must have worked on them. So I started to study them collecting dozens of historical catalogs looking for evidence of this earthquake. I was looking for every single mention I could find for an earthquake in 33 A.D. At the same time I needed to know if Matthew was reliable. - Now when people open the Bible and they see the Gospel according to Matthew or even if you got a Greek text, it would say in Greek the Gospel, according to Matthew. But the problem is those headings are from the fourth century, they're very late. They're attributed authorship. - The designation of the authorship of the Gospels is actually kind of unusual. They use a Greek phrase which is, which means according to. That did not usually mean author that meant source. It meant according to so-and-so. - The Four Gospels that we have with regard to the New Testament, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, none of them gives the name of its author. - So the Gospels use this structure which normally would suggest that these people, these names are not the people who wrote the books but are the people who here the source for the material in the books. - But the idea that many readers have is that's Matthew one of the 12 apostles. There's no evidence that that would be the case. There were two of Jesus's disciples that were called Matthew and we might even have a third Matthew, and so that name cannot automatically be assumed to come from Matthew the Apostle of Jesus. - So most of us in the academic world would say it anonymous. - We're pretty sure these Gospels originally circulated anonymously and someone later gave them names. And even the person, whoever that was who gave them those names is trying to suggest that these names are the sources for the books rather than the actual authors and that got quickly forgot. The Christian apologist of the time just started really selling these Gospels as written by these authors and made up legends about them and so on. But mainstream scholars generally don't believe the legends and things like that. - In the 19th century scholars began to do very serious literary criticism on the relationship of the first three gospels to each other. These Gospels are called synoptic Gospels that is to say when you compare them they look alike, they follow a similar form, a similar development of the narrative. They even use similar stories. And the church has been much exercised over the question of what is the sequence of those Gospels. - Matthew has a lot of priority, mainly because it's first but that's actually quite misleading historically speaking because he definitely is not the earliest Gospel. And early Christians thought he was but as scholars we now have pretty well established the chronology that Mark, the shortest, is actually the earliest. - Well that's again, that's a matter of opinion, I think the juries out on that. But in the 1800's there was an effort on the part of the German government to discredit Christianity and so they came up with this theory that Mark was the very first Gospel is the shortest, to adding things that can't be original, which is not necessarily true. - When Matthew comes to record the death of Jesus it's in the next to the last chapter, chapter 27 of Matthew, his source is Mark, that's really all he has, he doesn't have independent sources. And if you compare them side by side you can see he's just going through and editing, it's literally a second edition. But when he comes to very death of Jesus he presents a whole interpolation that Mark does not have, his source does not have and it's extremely embellished and supernatural. Mark simple has Jesus die and he breathes his last, and the centurion says, "Truly this is the Son of God", and it's basically all over. But Matthew has a great earthquake, people being raised from the dead, angel come from heaven, he's in dazzling apparel, there's another earthquake, and people fall over dead. So you can see if you just take Mark and Matthew side by side he is essentially retelling the story of Mark but in an extremely supernatural embellished way. After all for Matthew this is the virgin born Son of God. He can't have an ending like Mark has. It's gotta be a glory hallelujah ending and he certainly provides that. We're trying to match an earthquake in a section to an earthquake recorded in these catalogs. But I started to realize that most of these catalogs were just referring to other catalogs. So I needed to go beyond the catalogs and read the original source documents, the ancient books, the ancient letters, old margin notes, whatever, that are the source of every single entry in every single catalog. At first I felt lost reading the historical source documents, they weren't in English, it was archaic, and I didn't initially understand the context. The old text could be a mess, sometimes they described an earthquakes that were too large to believed or the date of an earthquake from two different historical sources didn't always agree. Sometimes they didn't even describe a real earthquake. But none of the other geologists were reading the historical source documents. They were relying solely on the historical earthquake catalogs. - There are many historical catalog all over the world. And the ones here the Middle East and in the Mediterranean are one of the best ones in the world because the civilizations have existed here continuously throughout the past 2,000, 3,000 or more years. - So this was the purpose of Revital work. So she described the... She actually discovered most of the historical earthworks. She found that these seismites, these deformations that she sees were the same time as historical earthquakes that she could compare them to historical earthquakes and she could see that almost all of the historical earthquakes known from historical records that historians have been collecting all these years she could actually see them in the geological record. - And when we put all of them together then we see that one by one we can match the past 2,000 years. - I found out that almost all the catalogs have been compiled by scientists not by historians. They contained errors, sometimes significant errors. I tried to tell this to Revital but she cut me off, "I'm a geologist not a historian," she said, "That's not my job." - Nothing an be more accurate than this because you get historical documents of people that are describing the situation and you have the exact date of this. - Nobody listened to me. In 2002 completed my thesis and I knew that it was more correct than the other study in Nahal Zeelim. I studied the historical source documents for every earthquake in the section and now I knew what the source for the 33 A.D. earthquake. But Bodhi Stein asked me, "To wait to publish it till Revital completed her PhD." I agreed, and their article was published. An article that said among other things, "That there was an earthquake in 33 A.D." I waited two years before I published my thesis, it was 2004, same year that my daughter was born. No one read it, no one sited it. But most important the historical errors that I pointed out were ignored. I didn't give up, I kept working. I knew we hadn't figured this earthquake out, there was a lot more work to be done. Every year I went to the Dead Sea and I took samples. I brought them back and I studied them. I knew I was looked upon as an intruder, someone who came to the Holy Land with the wrong purpose. I felt the pressure but I persisted. Something began to change in me, probably in my attitude. For the first time I began to think that I was on the road to being the only person in the world who understood this earthquake, the crucifixion quake. I went through every catalog that mentioned the 33 A.D. earthquake and followed every single reference back and they all lead to one source, only one source. - When you get over to the New Testament you have your Gospels, to me those are mostly literature. Are they based on fact? Well, of course there's some fact but the question is what kind of fact? Have they reversed fact? - They're not a biography in the modern sense of the word but they are historical. That's as far as what the church teaches. Others may disagree with that of course but as far as what we believe as Catholics. - I would say you should approach them as literature. They are great literature, no doubt about that they are great literature, and they will be here a thousand years from now and they will be considered great literature. Faith requires no reason. Matthew wants us to know that the appearance of Jesus Christ in this world and the report that he makes about him is a historically verified account. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, they all do the same thing. Our scholars have been arguing about this for the last hundred or 200 years, and I wouldn't even try to got there. I just know that his crucifixion was among many others, so many crucifixions that there was not enough wood for the crosses, nor enough hills or places to place them up on. There's so much evidence has been destroyed, it's so ambiguous and difficult to really figure out what really happened that we can't be sure. I do think though the evidence kind of tends to suggest that he didn't exist really and that the character of Jesus walking around Galilee as a historical person gathering disciples is a story that was created later. - Just because something is literature doesn't mean it doesn't have historical references in it. The question is what's the spin? What's the attitude? How is it presented? That's more the literary aspect of something. Now was there an earthquake in the 30's? Probably, if it's referred to there probably was. That's nothing to do with the spin so to speak, if you wanna call it that or the way the narration is framed or the way the narrators present their facts. Be careful what is literary and what is real history. - I don't need to believe that the Gospels are entirely mythical and fictional. I could fully believe that there's history in there and that it's just been exaggerated because that's completed compatible with my atheism so there's no threat to me to suggest that there's real historical facts in the Gospels. It just so happens that the more I look at the Gospels the more I realize that that's not the case. - And interesting enough the church does not require that we have the scientific evidence. You have it, great, right, additional proofs wonderful. But our faith isn't based upon the scientific evidence. - Faith is not foully. it's not guessing, it's not flipping a coin. Faith is making a judicious commitment to something that you have reason to trust. What the historical veracity and reliability cannot do is convince us of the meaning. And we know this from our lives, for example, if someone says to you or to me I love you, that is a statement that cannot be proven historically. In order to rightly interpret that statement we have to know a lot about that person. Is he or she a truthful person? Is my experience been one of loving or has it not been and so forth. And it's only on the basis of that larger objective context that then we can understand the statement I love you. A person that you trust you will believe. A person that you do not trust, no matter how sincerely that person claims to say it you will not trust. When scholars work hard to reconstruct the context of the New Testament they, we, I, need to be aware that at best we are creating that context in which readers then can make a right judgment, a judicious judgment on the claims of the text. But the claims of the text cannot be proven. In the same way that if I say to someone or someone says to you, I love you, we cannot say to that person prove it. - My main paper from 2004, which was published in the International Journal was a result of the work of Amotz Agnon, of Revital Bookman, and Morti Stein. All the colleagues they're very happy with my results. In 2007 I made contact with the Germans who did the first work on the Ein Gedi core. I was able to exam the exact same core that Claudia Migowski studied for her PhD. - Claudia sent me the data and we meet occasionally from Germany, again working on the interpretations, suggesting methods of screening, of understanding what we were are looking at. - Claudia was reviewing the catalogs in her way and then Elisa Kagan she in her paper, she again reviewed the catalogs. She came up with the date of 33 A.D. for this earthquake but I knew that geology wasn't that precise so I worked out a new date 26 to 36 A.D. - I took all the dates they had and tried to match it with my results. I was just having my own earthquakes and then the historical catalog and was trying to match those. - If the matching is more or less okay and it's more or less okay then it gives support to both sides. Supporting the historical document, supporting the interpretations. I had to make a distinction that the other people weren't making. I started to call the earthquake described in Matthew the crucifixion quake. And the best year for this supposed earthquake is 33 A.D. But I called the earthquake that I saw in the sediments the Jerusalem quake because I knew that it shook Jerusalem but I didn't know if it had an relationship with the crucifixion quake. - On the basic of science is that you know you can really, comes new data and you can change your interpretation. Otherwise it's not science, that's the definition of science. This is how we have to talk about this earthquake. It struck during the reign of Pontius Pilate but we don't know in which of those 10 years at least not yet. - Several very strong earthquakes, which anchored my matching. And there was one earthquake, which I estimated to 33 A.D. - I kept getting asked, "Why was I the only one coming up with a range of 10 years when this earthquake had already been precisely dated multiple times to 33 A.D?" It was because I understood where 33 A.D. came from. And I did not realize that it was only the Bible which said that. And so I checked what was the reference on those catalogs, on the 33 A.D., do you remember what was there? - I cannot comment on it. I really cannot comment. - The Bible, I don't know. Exactly. Is there one that was 33? - I don't know. I don't remember the numbers. - Okay. - This is like a, you know somebody telling jokes by numbers. - I don't really feel comfortable talking about this specific earthquake but I what I can say is that I looked at my, the geological records that I saw on the different sides and I had, I did not think about the historical earthquakes, I dated them independently. I was not trying to find any specific earthquake. - We're in another conversation now, even one single word was not related to religion. So this is out of the blue question now, it's not related to our conversation at all. I can put it in a very simple way science is science and religion is religion, that's all. - Yeah, I remember about this earthquake popping in some of the outcrops. I need to look at the tables to give you a responsible answer because I never memorized. - In this table you can see for every seismic the different historical earthquakes that fit into this time period, right, those are the different options for that event. And then when I actually decide what to choose here, Ein Feshka I correlated to 33 A.D. I don't know what you're, why you're, you wanna see it? - If you have such a lot of earthquakes to match up you take it for granted that they have the catalog and they have the facts, historical facts. - This is the way it worked out with the dating. - We mainly looked at catalogs and when they conflict we might look into sources. Honestly it's not something standard for us to look. - I was not involved in looking at the catalogs. - Okay. - I trusted her. - Trusted her. - Yeah. - The Discovery News article said, "That I determined an exact date for the earthquake, April 3, 33 A.D." The same year as everybody else. But that's not what I did it's more complicated than that. I never came up with such a precise date, I did the opposite. I dated the earthquake to a 10 year time span based only on the geology. They wrote an article about an article I had recently gotten published in a scientific journal. Based on what they wrote I'm certain they didn't even bother to read my article, all they read was the abstract. They fabricated quotes from me from an interview that never even took place. Everything was falling apart. Do you know what that feels like? You put 13 years of time, money, and effort into something and within 48 hours it's all gone. - My name is Etan Campbell. I was born in Wilmington, Delaware. I moved to the State of Israel in 1968 with my parents and three brothers. And for the most part I've been here for the last 50 years. And it's been quite an experience. At one point when I was younger I had this question mark in my mind, what was I missing in the United States? And I went back, I was there for maybe a year, a little over and I had this intense craving to get back to Israel. I think there's a special energy here in this country. It takes us all back so far in our memories to historical events, the Bible. Remember that the three major religions were born in the desert and people come and wanna feel and take part in the little way of understanding this chapter in history. Everyone can find that little thread that pulls him into the nucleus of the country. There is nothing like feeling the land with your legs, touching the stones with your hands. Keep tuned, and keep open, and aware you will feel this. Jerusalem is a very intense spiritual city. I feel it very strongly when I go there. I can visit Jerusalem, I wouldn't wanna live in Jerusalem. There's an energy that comes through and it can be felt. It taps into each one of us, moves between everyone and when it's done in a collective way as you would feel in Jerusalem it becomes extremely intense. To me it's overwhelming. - The human psyche is composed of energies that we don't know very much about. Energies from our unconscious selves. And these energies that everybody shares in common, universal energies are called archetypes. Humans need a mother, they need a father, they need to know who mother and father are. They wanna be nurtured by mother and father. So mother and father are archetypes that every human being shares. Now Carl Jung said, "That we all our born with a God image." A religious function is another name he called it. He also called it the Essential Self, self with capital S. And he believed that archetype of the self was our core and our circumference. He believe that every human need to believe that there is spiritual purpose and meaning to life. If we didn't then there would be no such thing as religion. Everyone whether they believe in organized religion or not, whether they believe in the same God or not everybody has a yearning to be related to something benevolent, that's greater than them. And so we believe in the God of our culture but that God is just our culture's God image of a bigger power that we all want to be connected to. Everybody has that basic need. That comes from the archetype of the self. So an archetype is a very real emotional and physical power that can influence every aspect of our lives for good or for ill. We can use that archetypal energy consciously or we can allow it to swamp us to the point that our dark side comes out, our shadow. - Well there is definitely the good God and there, we as Catholics believe in a thing called demons. So yes, there is bad energy too. And we have to make choice what we wanna be part of. The energy of those archetypes that are shared by large amount of people, when you've got enough people that energy can get very big and very powerful until we have mass hysteria. It's a lot harder for an individual to resist a mass movement of energy than it is to join it. I felt I was finished but I couldn't quit this. 26 to 36 A.D. is not an answer, it's a question. Everything I'd been doing up to that moment had prepared me to do this serious work to figure this story out. I needed to work out specific timing but nobody wanted to work with me now. They were afraid of what I might do to their reputation. I felt alone, deflated, defeated but also angry. - It's a natural human response to being ignored. And a natural human response is too be hurt and to get angry. Is that negative, it depends on how you use it. If you are so caught up in it that you cannot look at the situation objectively anymore because the archetype has taken over, the anger, that emotion is very powerful. You start thinking about it and you dwell on it. That anger could be a not a good thing for you. I was angry about the indifference. I was angry about the lies that had been broadcast in the media. If felt like the whole world was against me, everything bad was happening while my life was falling apart. I started receiving threats. At first they were anonymous, then they weren't anonymous. And then they moved into violence, I didn't know how to deal with that. My anger was increasing. I realized I needed to deal with it. Driving helped, finding places to be alone and think. I needed a discipline, a spiritual practice to challenge my anger otherwise it was going to eat me up. I needed to focus my mind and find peace to complete my mission. I locked myself in the lab to work on the sediments. I worked every single day. I wanted to find the truth. I made progress but I wanted perfection so I started to work at night too. I got obsessed, worked for nine months straight. It was just me, my lab, and the data that were sitting there in the sediments. I couldn't quit, I couldn't stop working. I couldn't stop reading history looking for clues in the text. I just couldn't stop. My father died, he died needlessly due to negligence and indifference at a hospital. It was awful, I cried. I still miss him but life goes on. My daughter, my mother, and I we mourned his loss and we moved on. On the other hand anger can often be a great motivator. If you have a great deal of passion about something and other people don't think it's important and they dismiss you and you're angry about that that can make you even more determined to try to prove it to people. That's a matter of how conscious you are. A consciousness means that you are learning to paying attention to your feelings and what you're doing with those feelings so it's up to every individual to do enough inner work. The violence toward me kept going. I want it to stop but it won't. But then a miracle happened, my spiritual practice taught me how to discipline my mind so that I could handle it and make it go away. I trained my soul to accept and deflect the violence. I had this discipline I followed every day for years, this spiritual practice and slowly my anger subsided replaced by determination and peace. My mission was keeping me alive. I wasn't gonna let anybody stop me. I would persist until I succeeded. This may be my last trip. I need to collect all the data required because I don't know if I'm gonna make it back. I had to step back and look at the big picture, at all these other events recorded on the day that Jesus died because I think it is only by looking at everything that we can figure out if this text is reliable. I realize that there were other parts of the text, which would or could have left a mark in the sediments. The key is to determine if they happened together on the same day. Was it a conjunction of events on one momentous day or bits and pieces of oral history that occurred at different points in time cobbled together into one dramatic narrative to make a point. I don't know the answer to that but I think the sediments do. If we could only figure out how to read them. I wanna know what happened on that day. I wanna know the specific timing. I wanna know what was in the air because it's possible now. So I better get ready. - It appears to be a law of the universe that when you awaken to a great passion the universe begins to open doors. And so yes that would be very much like what happened to your geologist. He suddenly awakened to this exciting new possibility and that's when his life took a different direction. He began to find his purpose in life and when that happens to somebody there's no stopping him. I gotta go. And this time I have to date an entire section so I can be sure that I'm working on the right earthquake. I have to do exactly what Revital did and that's not easy. I think now I finally gonna understand what they went through, all that work, all that thinking and wondering, did I get this date right, did I get that date right? Geology is an interpretive science. We deal with a lot of uncertainty. Until now I based my work on what Revital, Claudia, and Elisa did matching approximate dates from geology to sometimes also approximate dates from history. Now I have to provide my dates and just like I saw mistakes in their work I know I am gonna make mistakes. There's no way to do geology without making at least some mistakes. What if there's something I'm not considering like they did when they dealt with the catalogs, the more you do this, the more you know there's always something you're not considering. I'm worried. - The Gospels and also outside the Gospels there's a writing by a Roman historian called Tacitus and he tells us that Christ was crucified when Pontius Pilate was governing Judea and when Tiberius was a Roman emperor and the Gospels say the same thing. And we know from Roman records when Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judea, and we know when Tiberius was the emperor, and so from these dates we know that the crucifixion must have been in the 10 year period A.D. 26 to 36. We know the crucifixion was on a Friday because all four Gospels say, "That Jesus was crucified on the eve of the Sabbath." And so the eve of the Sabbath was a Friday so Jesus was crucified on a Friday, and all early literature says the same thing. And then Matthew's Gospel tells us the time that Jesus died. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice my God, my God. - He said, "That Jesus died at the ninth hour." And the Jewish people they calculated their hours of sunlight from when the sun rose in the morning, which at Easter time was six o'clock in the morning so from six o'clock in the morning you add on nine hours... that's three o'clock in the afternoon. So we know that Jesus died at 3:00 p.m. on a Friday in this 10 year period A.D. 26 to 36. One of the major apparent discrepancies in the Gospels is that Matthew, Mark, and Luke say, "That the last supper that Jesus had was a Passover meal." And John's Gospel equally clearly says, "It was before the Passover meal." And this is a very strange mistake to make because Jewish people were very familiar with Passover, a very special meal so they would never mistake an ordinary meal for a Passover meal. I came up with this theory that the reason for this is that they're both using different calendars. So Matthew, Mark, and Luke were using a calendar which in fact was an ancient calendar, which Jesus chose to use and John was describing events according to the official Jewish calendar in that first century A.D. We have solar calendar in the west today, then the Jewish people had a lunar calendar. And the first day of the month in their calendar was when new crescent moon could first been seen. And the Jewish month is from one observation of the new moon to the next observation of the new moon so the new light from the new moon meant a new month basically. And the first month of their lunar year they called Nissan, and in our calendar that corresponds to March-April. And so the Gospels say, "That Jesus was crucified in the month of Nissan." So we know he was crucified in March or April in our terms. When the moon is invisible that's when it's called conjunction, when the Moon, and the Sun, and the Earth are in a straight line and then you can't see the Moon. And then it starts again as a new moon. We see to start with a faintly growing crescent moon and then the moon grows to a quarter moon, and then a half moon, and then the full moon. And the full moon's in the middle of month and in Jewish terms that would have been either 14 or 15 the sun, the full moon and that corresponds with the Gospels say it's a Passover time and so we know that was a full moon when Jesus was crucified. If John's Gospel is correct then Jesus was crucified exactly when the first Passover lambs were slain. On the other hand if the Synoptics are correct it would appear that Jesus was crucified a day later on 15 Nissan. And so these are the two possibilities that come out of the Gospels we consider Jesus was either crucified on Nissan 14 or Nissan 15. And what we can do we can now use a astronomy to calculate when that would have been. So Newton was very great scientist, in fact he's one of the greatest scientist in the world but what most people don't know is he actually wrote more about religion than he wrote about science. And he was really interested in religion. He had decided first I think, he was the first person to say, "Let's try to reconstruct the Jewish calendar," in the first century A.D. He was using what were called orreries, this mechanical simulation and he just wound it backwards in time to the first century A.D. And so he reconstructed the Jewish calendar at that time. He was the first person to come up with a date for the crucifixion using this scientific method, a date in April A.D. 34 and that is indeed still a possible date for the crucifixion so what he did was very scientific. Our method is more accurate because we understand the equations in motion of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon around the Earth, we understand it more accurately. So Newton happened to get one of the right dates but other ones, possible dates he got wrong because he assumed that the Earth's rate of rotation that you can measure now and he measured it, well, you know once every 24 hours it goes around that varies in time and he didn't know that, he thought it was constant. And it varies in time because of our tides, it's called lunar friction. And he just didn't know that, we know that now and we can take this account in our calculations of the ancient Jewish calendar. What I tried to do was to reconstruct the Jewish calendar in the first century A.D. So just as today we can use astronomy to calculate when the first crescent moon would be seen, we can use astronomy to wind the equations back as it were. I was fortunate to work with a very good astrophysicist in Oxford University called Dr. Graeme Waddington. So I explained the problem to him and he calculated the calendars. He wrote a new set of computer programs and we checked this programs against over 1,000 recent and old observations of the new moon and it gave the correct result every time so I have a lot of confidence in this calendar. Today we use what's called the Gregorian calendar but before this reform people used what was called a Julian calendar, which Julius Caesar inaugurated back in Rome. And so the convention is from the first century A.D. we always refer the dates back to the Julian calendar because that's what the Roman's used at the time and we transferred our dates in the Jewish calendar to this Roman Julian calendar. We got a calendar then we could ask this question in this period A.D. 26 to 36 when did Nissan 14 or Nissan 15 because we're not sure what's right, fall on a Friday? We find that eliminates every year apart from A.D. 27, A.D. 30, A.D. 33, and A.D. 34 so those are the four possible years for the crucifixion. I feel a lot of responsibility after every thing that happened. I can't mess this up, I have to do it right. I wanna do it right. I don't wanna tell the world the wrong thing. I feel the pressure. The only solution I have is that I have to be open to present all my data so that if I do make a mistake someone could correct it. Even though you desperately want to achieve perfection you can't and you know that, and that makes you worry. Everyday, all day, I'm bothered by this. I'm worried. The greatest clue we have in the Biblical account is the time of year. It's not very specific about the year he died, it gives us clues that we have to do detective work on. But it's very specific on the time of year and that's in the spring, late March, early April. What if there's a way to ask the sediment in what season of the year this earthquake occurred. - A palynologist is somebody who works with pollen grains. It can be modern day pollen grains that we find in the air and cause allergy or it can be fossil pollen grains we find in sediments when it has fall into the water and is trapped in the mud at the bottom of lakes or the sea. Most people use palynology to reconstruct ancient vegetation and ancient climate but we can also use it for something completely different look at natural hazards and events such as earthquakes. My main specialty is to work with fossil pollen grains, those that are trapped in the sediments at the bottom of a lake or the sea. If there is not too much air, if the environment is poor in oxygen then the pollen grains can survive millions of years in the sediment that turns over the ages into rocks. The advantage of the Dead Sea is that it's dead, there's no life in the Dead Sea therefore there are no shells and worms that could mix up the layers. In most lakes everything is mixed up but the Dead Sea is exceptional there are very few lakes like that in the world that their layers are well preserved and that's very bottom source of information. We can use the study of pollen grains to find out when those layers were formed especially at what season of the year. Different plants will bloom at different times of the year and produce pollen in the air and so when the mud layer is forming at the bottom of the lake if we look at the pollen in it we can say when that mud layer has formed. He was going to send me blocks of sediments is true of the age, I bring it to the lab and there I will make a pollen slide, a very thin layer of glycerol where the pollen grains are swimming, then analyze the slide with my microscope. And then I can start making some statistics on them to try to see if we have more pollen grains from spring blooms or more pollen grains from autumn blooms. No we cannot provide absolute ages. We cannot say it was 30 A.D or 33 A.D. or something like that's, we cannot do that but we can say it was in spring, it was in winter, or in autumn. We have to be very careful here and trying really to keep to the fact not to jump to hypothesis too quickly. We are working in a field between science and religion and so the limit between the two sometimes can be a bit blurry and some people do not hesitate to mix the two. This is the way I'm working right now I will go there and I will not focus only on this earthquake, right now this is not only thing I see. I started to have a wider vision. We have a lot of questions but I think it's possible to have an answer now. I've been waiting 20 years for an answer, it's time now. And the only place where we can find this answer is in the big picture. We have to put all the evidence together and see if they all match. We have clear evidence of an earthquake in the 10 year time period of 26 to 36 A.D. Clues in the text give us four possible dates for the crucifixion in the same 10 year time period. We can now work out the season of the year studying the pollen to see if it matches with the story on one of these dates. But there's also something else for 10 years I've been staring at this dark layer in the sediments. I wasn't sure what it was but now I think I know what it is and this is the other thing I wanna find out during my trip. This could be a crucial clue to solve this mystery. - I definitely see Matthew expanded, embellishing, making everything more supernatural, more dramatic because he wants a powerful Jesus who is the cosmic center of everything. Mark's not quite like that but Mark does have two events right when Jesus dies that we can't simply overlook. And one is that around noon there's darkness till about three in the afternoon. After the six hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. - The question is what might that darkness have been due to? And there was an early idea it was due to an eclipse of the Sun. - There's no evidence was an eclipse that could have occurred, certainly could not have occurred during a Passover that's actually astronomically impossible, the Moon is in the wrong place for there to be a solar eclipse and solar eclipses don't last three hours. - We can rule that out because you can only have an eclipse of the Sun at new moon time and we know the crucifixion was at full moon time so it couldn't have been an eclipse of the Sun. - So we don't really have any eclipses that you can map onto there and more over Mark isn't describing an eclipse, he says, "A three hour darkness." It's not an eclipse this is a supernatural event he's conveying here. - There's ancient writing called, the Sibylline Oracles, it's in the Apocrypha. The quote says there's something like, "Dust arose in the Sun's light failed at midday." So this actually says it was a dust storm and you can't have dust storms which last for three hours. - You know you're in a dust storm if you're in a high wind event and your visibility starts to drop, the particles are becoming suspended in the air and they're blocking out the transmittance of light. So you usually observe it as like a brown pall in the air. And if you're in a really strong dust storm you're going to be physically impacted. And at really high levels you'll have trouble breathing. It can actually start to affect your lung functioning. - If there was such a dust storm Mark clearly is not writing it that way. He doesn't say there was a dust storm and the dust, you know blotted out the Sun. He just says basically there was darkness over the earth. In fact the term he uses normally meant the entire world. - The seasons of dust storms today we know from records are the same season of dust storms you know thousands of years ago they're recorded in Egyptian literature and they are in the spring so these happen in the spring. So it really does fit Passover in Nissan, which is March or April in our calender. - I would include the Dead Sea area in the Middle east. Yeah, I would think that you would likely have more than one dust event in a year. - We can't know that he's getting it from a real event and since we don't have any independent documentation of such an event, no historian records there being a dust storm, far as I know there's no geological evidence of it. - If it's dark from 12 to three it is possible to have a dust event that would last long enough to potentially obscure the Sun but it would have to be a very intense dust storm I think. - Because we can't show that we can't know that. It's still possible, certainly possible but we just don't know. And again you have the same problem it might not been the same day or the same year, they might of just been moved to the time to fit. - A, it's too speculative because you have no idea on what the winds were doing so you know you can speculate if the wind stayed at 25 meters per second for three hours straight then the obscuration would last, could potential last that long but I don't want to put any affirmation from myself on that story. This dark layer appears to be a dust storm deposit and we can study it. It's not gonna be easy but it could contain the chronological key to unlock this mystery. What if there's evidence of a massive dust storm on the same day as the Jerusalem quake? What if there's evidence that there wasn't a dust storm on that day or on a different day a few years later? Chronology, synchronicity is the place where I can find an answer. Having a purpose in your life and believing that you are moving in the direction that you are meant to is a very good thing. But I think that you have to release your attachment to the outcome 'cause you aren't gonna be able to control the outcome. I'm calling myself an earthquake geologist but am I really an earthquake geologist? Can I pull this off? I think I can. I think I can because I'm desperate, I'm hungry, I need to figure this out. The world needs to figure this out. I just hope and pray that I can play my part and not screw it up. - One of the things that needs to be considered besides the Gospels is the Book of Acts because in the second chapter of the Book of Acts right after Jesus's death and he ascends to heaven and leaves the followers of Jesus have this experience in which it's described as the Holy Spirit is poured out upon them. And they explain this based on a prophecy from Joel Chapter 2, which says, "In the last days I'll pour out my spirit on all flesh." Now I don't take that as historical video tape of what happened that day but I do think it's instructive in that this community at this time is thinking they're in the apocalyptic period. Apocalyptic means revelatory. The ancient Jews believed that at the end of time God was going to intercede in this world, he was going to initiate something that would conclude history. We would call the final judgment or the second coming of Christ. These magnificent events at the end of time will be accompanied by extraordinary signs. The Sun'll be darkened, the Moon'll turn to blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord. - So the author of the Book of Acts is doing the same thing that he does and other writers do with the Gospels is he's creating a fictional story that sells a particular narrative that he wants people to believe. - There are two other documents which really specify this, one is what's called the Report of Pilate, which is a report of Pilate about the crucifixion. And this report says, "At his crucifixion the Sun was darken and the Moon was even turned into Blood." And then 400 years later a very Orthodox bishop writes, "That at the crucifixion the Moon appeared like Blood." So we have three references the moon being like blood and scientifically we know a blood red moon is an eclipse moon. - There's a lot of stuff that happens in Acts that doesn't make any plausible sense. It's rewriting history to tell the version of history that that author wants to have been true rather than the version of history that actually happened. And this makes it really difficult for us to figure what if anything in Acts about the history of the church is actually true. - What scientist can do is they can calculate eclipses in the future. We can also calculate past eclipses. And so Graeme Waddington calculated past eclipses which were visible from Jerusalem in the years A.D. 26 to 36 and he found one eclipse and only one eclipse. Chronology, chronology, synchronicity, synchronicity, this is place where I can find it. We have clear evidence of an earthquake in the 10 year time period of 26 to 36 A.D. We can now work out the season of the year studying the pollen to see if it matches with the story on one of these dates. - The date was in spring, it was in winter, or in autumn. - The clues in the text give us four possible dates for the crucifixion in the same 10 year time period. - We got a calendar then we can ask the question, in this period A.D. 26 to 36 when did Nissan 14 or Nissan 15 fall on a Friday? We find that eliminates every year apart from A.D. 27, A.D. 30, A.D. 33, and A.D. 34 so those are the four possible years for crucifixion. A.D. 27 is really too early. - Well in the Gospel of Luke we're told that John the Baptist, the one who came before Jesus, prepared Jesus way, he started his ministry in the year, 14th year of Tiberius Caesar. And we know from historical Roman documents what year that was and that was in fact A.D. 29. So if John the Baptist starts in A.D. 29 Jesus couldn't have died in 27 A.D.. - And then we can rule A.D. 34 because the Apostle Paul was converted after the crucifixion. - He was converted about 34 A.D., 18 months after Jesus's crucifixion so Jesus could not have been crucified. - And so that just means we got two possible years which are A.D. 30 and A.D 33 so we just look at small pieces of evidence. In John's Gospel he says, "In the first year of the ministry of Jesus the Jews questioned Jesus." And Jesus says, "I can destroy this temple in three days." - How can you do this? It took 46 years. And apparently the Greek word for temple is the inner sanctuary. That inner sanctuary was finished in the year 31. - So the crucifixion cannot of been A.D. 30. So we can rule that out and we're just left this one date and Jesus died on Friday third of April A.D. 33 at three o'clock in the afternoon. Jesus died on Friday third of April A.D. 33 at three o'clock in the afternoon. Chronology, chronology, synchronicity. There was evidence of a dust storm in the sediments. - There's darkness- - It would have to be- - At around noon. - Very intense dust. There's darkness till about three in the afternoon. - All of them say at the death of Jesus the temple curtain was torn. Maybe there was a lunar eclipse on that same night. - We can also calculate past eclipses. And they found one eclipses and only one eclipses. And that was on the third of April A.D. 33 so it's remarkable, that's exactly the same date as reduced from the Bible. If we put it all together what does this mean? - A synchronicity is a meaningful coincidence between mind and matter that cannot be explained by cause and effect. You get up in the morning you're thinking about your high school friend from 20 years ago or your college friend. And you wake up and that's all you can think about is like gosh I wonder how so-and-so's doing, I haven't seen her in years, I'd love to see her. And you go to work and you get out of your car and you're walking down the street and you turn the corner and there she is. You didn't make that happen, you didn't call 'em, there was no physical observable cause and effect relationship. We don't consciously make it happen something else makes a meaningful coincidence happen. The story of the passion of Jesus Christ is a very interesting example of some very overwhelming synchronicities. Had that not been so we would have no such thing as Christianity today. - Let's say we have an actual historian who was there and documents in his diary and we have the diary that Jesus was killed on exactly that day and there was an earthquake just then and there was a dust storm I think at best that would be an amazing coincidence. And then you would have reverse causation, you would have like that coincidence caused people to believe that Jesus was the real Messiah and cause Christianity. So rather than it being the proof that Christianity is true it's actually the series of coincidences that caused this religion to flourish. - I think when miracles are miracles of timing that things happen at just the right time in which no physical laws are broken. With the earthquake no physical laws were broken it was a natural earthquake, a natural eclipse as it were but the timing was just remarkable it likes synchronicity, it's like things really happen at the right time and God arranging the time is perfect. - I've told you that you have a problem when you're looking at the Gospels of separating literature from history. All the elements you've talked to me about could be real elements but to me these are all literary elements. I think that if this story's a factual story it raises our expectations that the whole story is true a lunar eclipse on the evening of crucifixion does suggest that you know there is a God and this is his perfect timing. I'm looking back at 20 years now when I first started this everybody thought I was trying to prove the text. But I wasn't trying to prove the text I was trying to determine something about the text to figure out the truth about the text. I didn't know the answers. - And then there's the whole idea you speak about of God's Son. You can become a Son of God but only in a symbolic way. It's a title that is given in terms of your behavior, you become like unto a Son of Gun. So was Jesus Son of God? Did all these elements occur at his crucifixion, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? To me these are all literary elements that these scientist or quasi scientists, whatever they may be are trying to work out and see if they can then work out and therefore I would not rely on any of their final conclusions even though they may be based on some important data. - As a Catholic priest I have no fear of science, it would only affirm my faith. I mean all these things really happened in the same day the old say coincidences are the footprints of God. God can use nature. A historical fact does not prove that Jesus is the Son of God. It can show that the Gospel of Matthew is historically accurate at that particular point but the claims of the document itself cannot be proven. They must be accepted by faith. Early on it felt like I was serving a higher power, something external seemed to be driving me to persist. It's as if the universe is conspiring to help you. It's like you have a spiritual awakening in a way. Now thought that drive seems more abstract, it's a higher purpose not necessarily a higher power. I don't know if I have any help beyond myself. I still wanna know the truth. I still have plan. I still know how to do this. But I don't know if I'll like the outcome. People will use my results for their own purposes, for their own belief, for their own disbelief. My instincts are driving me. My instincts tell me that there's something we don't know, something we can figure out. My instincts tell me that knowing the truth is a good thing. My instincts tell me to keep going even if the path is lonely, even if nobody understands me. But I'm not sad, I'm happy. I found peace. One reason that they would do this like have big climatic events, the eclipses, earthquakes conjoined with the death of someone is specifically to sell that idea, that this proves that the heavens agree that this was an important person. So we're gonna put an eclipse in there, we're gonna put an earthquake in there. And all of this stuff, it's all of a piece, it's the same kind of language that they're speaking, it's not historical writing, it's myth writing. - So you're saying if we have an interest in something and we want to spread that information that we have found that we might exaggerate. Sure. - The last time I almost died was over 20 years ago but I didn't die. - Are you asking me can we use it right now in telling this story? What if I didn't tell you exactly the truth about the story? Maybe I just exaggerated to make it stronger. I was supposed to be on that flight. My life had been spared Here I was still alive. I was supposed to be gone. What does that mean? - That's a human tendency, probably everybody does it more or less. It depends on what you're looking for in the story you're telling. If it were me and I was trying to convey the truth about a circumstance I'd feel guilty about stretching the truth and I'd wonder should I have done that. - When he comes to the very death of Jesus he presents a whole interpolation. - Be careful what is literary and what real history. - And it's extremely embellished and supernatural. - We as Catholics believe there are historical documents. - It's rewriting history to tell the version of history that that author wants to have been true. - On the other hand if I say, I'm telling you a really good story did it happen, did it not happen? I don't know you be the judge. But here's the way I see it, it's different. - Can you see it now? If you put all the pieces together it starts to make sense. I used to wonder if everything was supernatural and embellished. I see two ways to approach it, one everything is fiction, two everything is real or it's based on real events but the author compressed the timing to make a point. So if this is the case the next question is how much did they distort the timing of these events? Does everything happen at the same time or is the timing the fictional part? Cut. Okay, good. Let's do one more.
