His name is "Joseph." Joseph! Hey. (Sighs) How was school? Okay. Good. What'd you learn? Nothing. Fabulous. We're gonna have a great Christmas, huh? Yeah, I guess so. Hey, how about we go to the mall tomorrow, see Santa? Umm. There's no such thing as Santa. Oh, yeah? Who's the guy in the red suit with the white beard? Someone paid to look like that. Well, maybe you should get the lights and stuff out of the garage anyway. You know, in case you're wrong. You mean you got the tree? I got the tree. Otherwise how would Santa know to come? I've gotta get going. Listen, we'll put on the lights when I get home from work, okay? Okay. ( Slot machines ringing ) Sorry I'm late. Traffic. That's okay. Looks busy. Jackie... Yeah?

You know, you should get out more yourself. I haven't had a date since 1971. And what am I missing? Reno ain't Vegas. It's not like the old days, when there was glamor... And men were men.

Now... How about gettin' on top? Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm happy just like this. Good, baby. You like this? Mm-hmm. You're just saying that, right? No, I don't like it. Why do you make me do such dirty things, you bad boy? (Laughs) No, no. Sorry. I meant really. Oh. I mean...It must be tough, doing this. It's all right. Doing it with men, for money. That's the job description, all right. You're funny. Thanks. Did you do it with a lot of men tonight? No. Well, don't say that for my benefit. I don't mind if you did. Well, what? Um...Do you want me to say that I did? You're not exactly a little girl. Sorry. No, I'm just sayin' someone your age should work hard before she's too old for the job. Ohh. Forget it. I'm sorry. If you'd wanted a young girl, you should have been specific. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Here. Come on. Come on. There. That's better. I like mature women. You're just what I asked for. Great. Don't be like that. This is a nice room... I'm an okay guy, aren't I? I mean...At your age, you could be standing on street corners giving bums $5 blow jobs. I'm outta here. Cut the bullshit!

Christ, it's all over the place. What'd you do, try and roll him? Look, you gotta take the service elevator. Get the hell out of here. That's your cut. Anyone asks you anything, you just keep your mouth shut. I can't believe you fucked this up! This was a sweet gig. Look... No, let me see. Oh, beautiful. Get off the floor and get her a washcloth. This doesn't look good, Tommy. This kind of shit can't go on here. I know that. She fucked it up, it should have been okay. Hey...put this on your face so you don't drip anymore. It's okay. It's over. She's a whore, she's not calling the cops. She doesn't want her kid to see her picture in the paper. No, it's over. I'll say when it's over! She's going out the back. The trick's gone, no one's calling the cops. You callin' the cops? See? She's a whore. She doesn't want her kid to see her. She's a whore... (Cab dispatcher on radio) Where to? 4227 merritt. Nose bleed? Seen more than one nose bleed on this job. Let me see. Let me see your nose. Leave me alone. Come on, just let me see. Um...that's busted. Maybe we should get you to a doctor right away. No. Look, don't worry. Real doctor, no cops. You got fifty bucks? If you don't, I do. It's Jackie, right? Adam. Comptech 324. What? I'm in your computer class. ( Starts car ) What's your view here During the day, doc? The back of fedco. That's not so bad. Cracked at the septal conjunction. What should I do? I'd leave it alone. But I can't breathe. Well, wait for the swelling to settle down and then breathe. What's it gonna look like? Listen, you're lucky. There have been girls come by here with noses that looked like run-over tomatoes. A little bump on the nose isn't gonna kill your sex life. Now keep your head up, and no aspirin. Now... no lectures. Please. No, that's not my business. But did your friend tell you about my fee? Yeah. Fifty dollars, right? That's it. Well, I feel better, anyways. Good for you. You're gonna be all right? I can't go in like this. I'd have to think of something to say, and I'm too tired to think. Look, I'm on till 7 A.M. You can hang around my place till I get off. It ain't much, but you can have it to yourself. It's cleaner than it looks. Just don't look too close. The couch folds out into a bed. Clean sheets. I don't think I'll be doing much sleeping. Yeah, well, just in case. And maybe if you're around in the morning we can have some breakfast. ( Sighs ) Keep your head up. ( Laughs ) I mean for the bleeding. Oh, right. Thanks. Yeah. ( Phone rings ) Radio: We're back... ( Phone rings ) Triple a. Jackie: No car trouble tonight, Sarah. Don't tell me... you got lucky. (Coughs) Yeah, lucky. So you won't be back tonight? Listen, give Joseph oatmeal in the morning. He has to be on the bus at eight. So don't snooze away till noon. I don't want him missing that bus. Hey. I took care of all you crazy chorus girls for twenty-seven years. I can get one little boy off to school. Sarah. He'll be on the bus. Have fun. Ohh. Sarah: Joey! Hang on a second! Joey! Honey! Want a... okay! Have a nice day! ( Laughs, groans ) Jackie... I slipped and fell. I made a real fool of myself. Slipped and fell? Yes, I slipped and fell. What happened in here? Uh... I couldn't find the oatmeal. Damnit, Sarah. I get confused now and then. Yeah, you get drunk now and then. Did Joseph get his shot? He got his shot. So, now, tell me. I slipped, I fell. Bullshit. You got smacked. All right, I got smacked. I've already had a doctor check it out. What'd he say? Did you call the cops? Look, when you moved in here we agreed we would help each other out, with the rent, with the housework, and we also agreed that we would stay out if each other's business. So I shouldn't worry? He was a bad guy, Sarah. It happens. Look, I'm tired, my head is killing me, and I've gotta be at work in an hour. Don't forget who you are. What the hell does that mean? You know what it means. ( Sighs ) Just because you're not in the show anymore doesn't mean you give up your pride. ( Crying ) (Slot machine bells ringing) What happened to you? Oh, just a little Fender-bender. I'll be fine. You don't look fine. Frieda, I'll be fine. Excuse me. What size is this? Oh. ( Tapping on keyboard ) Adam: May I sit down? Okay. Hey, your nose looks better. Yeah. Look, if you, uh... you ever hit a woman? No. Never? Never. Well, you're still young. You're pretty pissed off. Let's change the subject, okay? Okay. Married? Nope. Kids? One. My son. How old? Eight. That's a cool age. Like to fish? My son? No, you. Nope. As conversations go, this isn't going that well, is it? No, not really. Look, I came out here on a bus four months ago. I met a few people, seen a few things. I bought a guitar, thought I'd learn how to play, but I haven't. Spent Thanksgiving by myself. And you? I'm taking computer classes so I can get a job in the hotels... reservations, management, something like that. Make enough money to support me and my son, fix up my house a little. Other than that... I really don't know. Like most people. You think? Oh, yeah. ( Sighs ) ( Joseph grunts ) What? Does it still hurt? Not so much. How'd you fall down? Joseph, I'd like to forget about it, okay? Okay. Sorry. No problem. So talk to me. Tell me about your day. Matt brought a rattlesnake to school. A live one? Pickled in a jar. It was kind of white, and it stared at you. They don't have eyelids. Hmm. Do you remember the one in Vegas? The one that dad killed? Came in off the desert, curled up on the hood of the car. That's because they're cold-blooded and they seek out heat. Really? Yeah, and they're more afraid of US than we're afraid of them. Are you thinking about dad? Honestly, I didn't know what I was thinking about. Guess I was just listening to you. You're a pretty interesting kid. I'd better be. It's not like I'm gonna be a big sports star or anything. Well, you never know what you're gonna end up. ( Sighs ) Do you like it here? Pretty much. Good. Is it on sale? Yes, 20% off. The dressing rooms are right over there. ( Speaks Japanese ) I'm gonna try it on. ( Japanese ) But it's on sale! 20% off. ( Japanese ) Ohh. You're making people very uncomfortable. Oh, come on, he was in a hurry. You don't look good at all. Frieda. I'm worried about you. Take a couple of weeks off. Do something for yourself. Listen, I really can't afford to do that. Marcie's all set to cover for you. Are you firing me? Not yet. Well, if you are, I need to know that now, not in two weeks. Great. So that's it. You don't even have the nerve to tell me to my face. Sure, I do. You're fired. I remember your first night in the show. You were such a baby. First time in Vegas. I was sewing for a lot of girls then, but I kept an eye out for you. ( Clatter ) I would have had somebody take care of this in a heartbeat. Take care of what? That guy who smacked you. So what happened? He was trying to get fresh with you and you wouldn't let him? Something like that. I figured. Somebody oughta clean his clock big-time. You don't let this shit go by. What's with all this gangster talk? Hey, you could use a gangster. Yeah. Well, bugsy's dead, in case you forgot. Too bad, because then there was gentlemen. But I know a guy. Big Sam. "Big Sam." Hey, he'll do what has to be done. What has to be done is, you need to deposit your disability check tomorrow. Do you think you could do that? You know, you're not turning out to be such an easy person to live with. Hiya, sweetie. Hey. ( Both laugh warmly ) Well, as always, you look fabulous. Yeah, well, don't look too close. I've had a little work done. No! You'd never know it. I'll take a vodka gimlet, please. Honey. It's a little bump on the nose. Everybody gets so excited. You okay? I guess so. I don't know. I miss the show, daria. I miss the people, the life. I mean, everything else just seems so... Tell me about it. I thought you were on at the lido. Oh, I was...for about a month. And then it was just like Vegas. My butt let me down. You've got a great butt. Yeah, like a rock... but it ain't nineteen. Whose is? A nineteen-year-old's. We probably should have been like everybody else who jumped in line to marry some rich guy. But, oh, when I was up there, it was so great. And I just thought, what's the rush? I mean, we got forever. Yeah. We weren't so brilliant, were we? No. No, and, uh, I had to go and fall for Rick. That was real smart. Is he helping you out at all? Sometimes he calls to talk to Joseph... From god knows where. So who gave you that nose? A trick. Look, I've had my moments too. You know, when I, uh, when I first started, I thought I would feel like shit, but it was really weird, I, uh... Didn't feel anything. Do you ever think about getting out of this town, away from the shows? The old life. Yeah. Then what? Beats me. Ha ha ha ha! Yeah. We got company. Jackie, say hello to big Sam. Hi. Hey. Hiya. Please, sit down. Excuse me. ( Muttering ) Big Sam? Don't worry. He can get the job done. The job? He'll nail that bastard. Sarah, you didn't tell him what happened? Of course I did. Damnit, Sarah! Damnit! Don't you ever listen to me? Some justice needs to get done. You had no right to embarrass me with this. Why should you be embarrassed? A date turns out to be a prick, it's not your fault. You should be embarrassed for going quietly like this. You forget about this! And send him home. I already paid him. What? A hundred bucks. Down payment. Where'd you get a hundred bucks? From the jewelry box. That money? That money? Sarah, I got laid off at the gift shop. That's all we've got. You're gonna have to get it back. Why don't you just listen to what the man has to say? Sarah. Oh. Thanks. It's a hard subject to sort of ease into. I know. So I'll just tell you, and you just tell me. I see what he did, and it pisses me off. Sam... Big Sam... I understand. It's the human response. You want me to smash his face into shreds. Look, I appreciate your... Kindness, but I don't know if I can do this. You're a nice lady. That's why there are people like me. If you're worried about me, uh, maybe going over the top, I'm always fair. He broke your nose; I'll break his nose. He's not a small man. You think I do it? I appreciate that also. But, um, look at me. I'm old. I could get hurt. Ah, well, you haven't decided. When and if you should be ready, I'm easy to find. The gold dust. Ask around. Sam, um... Oh... ( Chuckles ) I have to think about it. Pay me when you get serious. I'll keep the beer. ( Dog barking ) ( Knocks on door ) Hello there, sweet thing. Hi, daria. You're a little cutie-pie, you know that? Come on in. Well, happy holidays to you, too. Jackie? Back here. I brought sweet potatoes. On the table. Oh, there you are. Love you. Listen, you remember my little brother Phil, the one that had a crush on you? Oh, god, how could I forget? Well, he's now managing a hotel in Tucson. I told him you were looking for something, studying computers and all that, and he said he had something in reservations. Tucson. Whatever. I just thought I'd tell you. Thanks. ( Doorbell ) Oh, look at you! Come here! Oh, it's so good to see you! Both: Merry Christmas. You look fabulous. I'm afraid I've gained weight, but don't worry about it. What have you got in the bag? ( Laugher, chatter ) You want to do your part? Please. Thank you, and yourself? Fascinating! Please continue with whatever you've been saying, which I've only half been listening to, and already forgot. ( Doorbell ) Sarah, don't have a good time. Okay. Hello. Adam, from Jackie's computer class. Sarah. Jackie's dearest lifelong, overprotective friend. Pleased to meet you. Hmm. Uh...? Hi. Glad you could make it. Don't let all the girls scare ya. Those are all your buddies? Buddies? They all worked in the line together. The line? Dancing, singing. Showgirls. Didn't you ever see a show? Uh...sort of. Sort of. Geez. You never saw anything like her or you wouldn't say "sort of." Sarah. Believe me, there was nothing "sort of" about her. Sarah. All right. ( TV on ) ( Knock on door ) I'm awake. Too loud? Not really. How's your glucose? I feel all right. Who's that guy? Adam? He's from my computer class. He was alone for the holidays, so I invited him. Come on down if you want to. Not till daria leaves. Does daria bother you? She thinks i'm a real cute kid. Wouldn't that bother you? She doesn't have any kids what would she know? You okay? All right. ( Laughter, chatter, music ) Oh, come on, sugar, that's strip music. I ain't no stripper. Not yet, anyway. ( Rock music plays ) Show 'em how it's done, daria. All: Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! You get this one! Whoooo! Get ready for the real thing. Oh, no. Whoo! You got it! Good job! Make him into a man, honey! Whoo! Go! Go! Oh, thank you, Adam. Ohh. ( All laugh ) These look great. Oh, thank you. What daria was doing before, stripping, that's not what I did. No, I was in the show, the chorus. Yeah? Well, that's... that mask is nice. Isn't that beautiful? Sarah made that. Yeah? Mm-hmm. When I was a kid back in Pittsburgh, my girlfriend and I used to go up in the hills at night and pretend the lights were stage lights and the whole city was our audience. Those pictures in your bathroom. Those from back in Texas? Uh-huh. Your girlfriend? No. Wife. I got her pregnant, and... We had to get married, so we did. Hmm. So you have a kid. No. Due next month. Why aren't you there? ( Sighs ) She's with her folks. Guess I took off unexpectedly. I like her a lot; I don't love her. I send her what I can, it's not much, but... That's the way it is. So.... So. Uh, thanks for having me. Thanks for coming. ( Chuckles ) I'm freezing. Sorry. It's not your fault. No. But I am freezing. Better get back inside. Maybe... Good night. 'Night. Well, there's gotta be somebody who can talk to me about this job. I left my name and number yesterday, and no one called. Well, when is the manager going to be in? Well, I'm sorry, there's gotta be somebody there that who can talk to me about this job. No, but I am currently working on a degree in... no, I'm currently working on a degree in... no. No. Fine. I don't understand. You've got an ad in today's paper. Ahh. Never mind. Okay, thanks anyway. Okay, thanks anyway. Okay, thanks anyway. Shit. Ha ha ha ha ha! Wait... what? What are you doing here? I'm applying for a job. A straight job. I got laid off over at the summit. I know. You know? Look, Jackie, you can't be here. There ain't any jobs in here for you. How did you know I got laid off? It gets around. You got a name now, you know. No, I don't know. It's all over town. Tell me, why would I have a name? Well, he knows you. You pissed off the wrong guy. Look, I just need a job. Check it out. You're not allowed on the property. Go on. That's it. You want me to call 'em over? This is bullshit, Tommy. Yeah. Well? Aha ha! All, right, come on. Spiral. All right, spiral. Good one. All right, comin' atcha. Ready? All right, well, that was a good one. Come on, get it back here. Come on. Where are you? Jackie. Good one! Yeah? That was Melanie on the phone. She wants US to come to the show at the lido tonight. She's on at the lido? Her...(coughs)...her daughter. Her daughter's in the line. Do I have to go too? No. Don't worry, I'm not going either. Can't afford it. She's picking up the tab. Can you stand the excitement? Okay, you ready? All right, let's go. Man: Ladies and gentlemen, the lido is proud to present "Hawaiian thighs." ( Music, cheers, applause ) Oh, god. Look at the feathers. Try keeping them on the backing instead of on the floor. Waiter: Ma'am? Minimum? Two drinks. I'll have a vodka Martini, up. Both of them now. Yes, ma'am. She's gorgeous. Well, that'll be over soon enough. She'll never make it out of the line. Definitely not feature material. No. Not in Vegas, anyway. Not in the old days. I gotta pee. Okay. Where's your date? Do I know you? Come on. Get your hands off me. No unescorted women. That's the hotel policy. You're outta here. I saw a show, I'm having a drink. ( Chuckles ) Let's keep it friendly. I know you from the horizon, all right? What are you talking about? Let's walk. No! Make a scene, don't make a scene; Either way it's going to end up the same. This is private property. What about the debutantes working the tables? They look like nice girls to me. Come on. Hey! What the hell's going on? What are you supposed to be? I'm her friend, pinhead. She's leaving, and that's it. Hey! Jackie! No, no, no! No working girls at the lido, everybody knows that. Oh, come on. Unless they're on your goddamn list. You know I'm not working tonight, you see that I'm with a girlfriend. Come on. Listen close. Working, not working... you're not welcome. It's a simple message. Don't be too dumb to get it. Let her go or I'm calling the police! What the hell are you doing?! What we always do with friends like yours. Ohhh! Jackie! Honey! Jackie! Honey! ( Coughing ) What a way to treat a lady. You didn't think the three of US could get by on a part-time job at a gift shop and your disability check, did you? What are you talking about? They throw a girl in the pool, they figure by the time she goes home, changes, does her makeup, her working night is over. I can't work. I can hardly... I'm not asking you to go to work! Well... I'll move over with jeanine. I'll never be a burden... that's not what I'm saying, Sarah. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm just trying to tell you, that's...that's all. I've just fucking had it. ( Sighs ) Race announcer: We now have Four more to go. It's a longshot. Just for pennies comes up, and now your favorite, attleborough.... Hello there. You said I could... Yeah. Uh, this is Stan. Hi, Stan. I'm Jackie. He's happy to see you. He's had a stroke or two. I don't know what he's thinking, but ask him odds, he's razor sharp. Maybe we could go someplace else to talk? Um, Stan, I got business. You've decided. His name it Tommy adler. Tommy, the bellman at the horizon? He smacked you? I didn't think Tommy was that kind. No. Um... It was a trick he set me up with. I see. I thought we were talking about doing the guy who smacked you. I don't know who he is. But tommmy's got me eighty-sixed all over town, and I can't get a job anywhere, straight or anything. That can't be. What, you don't believe me? Tommy ain't big enough to get you eighty-sixed in the whole town. Well, he's got it set up that I can't out, have a drink, breathe...i mean nothing, without being hassled. And I've got a life here. Maybe if he knew that there would be consequences... What? So he can set you up with some more tricks? Is that what you want? It's a nice room here. Fills up a little in the evening. Otherwise it's just me and a few of the old guys. So... Say you give me a hundred up front. Promise me four hundred on installment. I'll take a walk some morning down pioneer Avenue. There's some guys hanging out. Any one of 'em wouldn't mind swinging on the guy, just for the fun of it, anyway. Later, I'll tell ya it's done. What happens? You get a warm glow? The whole world is bright? Or maybe you're thinking, "I'm out five hundred bucks and nothing has changed." Keep your money till you can bring me the right name. Tommy is, forgive me for saying so, bullshit. TV: Double the weather to win! (Knock on door) Come in. Close the door. So, nice Christmas Eve at home? Guess so. I got a date. Don't get excited. Do I know him? ( Laughs ) There he is. Kid, do you want to see him? That's big Sam? I don't want to seem like I'm dying to see him. On the other hand, if I wait for him to get to the front door I could be here all evening. ( Big Sam grunting ) You got your arthritis medicine? And my pepper spray. Don't stay up, Joey. The sooner you get to sleep, the sooner Santa will get here. All right, whatever. I think I'll go watch a little TV now. 'Night. You want me to come with you? That's all right. Okay. ( Knocking ) Thought y'all might be Home tonight. Come on in. We're just hanging out. Yeah? Yeah. Hi. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Joseph, we've got company. Come on down if you're bored. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. Hey, Adam. Hey, Joseph. See ya later. Hey, I got you a little something. Maybe you'd like to open it before I leave so I can see what it is. You don't know what it is? Not exactly. Actually, I've had it for a while, I just wrapped it up. What are you talking about? Got a hammer? Wow. A rock. You're supposed to kind of bust it open with the hammer. And? Just give it a whack with the hammer. Cool! This guy in Mexico gave it to me. Sometimes when you bust it open it can turn out to be nothing. But for some reason I never opened it up before. Thanks, Adam. He's asleep. This is good. Kind of gets to you, doesn't it? Yes. Mmm. What are you thinking? I'm thinking that this champagne is making me dizzy. What are you really thinking? Um, the other night when you left, I, uh, guess I didn't want you to go. I didn't want to go. I thought... I've got enough trouble in my life, I don't need this. You're a good guy... too young... and i'm... What? You're what? Not worth it. How did I end up feeling so worthless? A lot of people like to do that to each other around here. I guess most of my life I've... Pretty much gotten by on how I look. But that's all. That's not all. You know that's not all. Adam... God, you're beautiful. I don't look the way I used to. I don't care about the way you used to. You're beautiful now. You can't stay. Joseph. ( Sighs ) What? Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if he saw you with somebody who treated you nice. I don't need to be told how to take care of my son. That's not what I was saying. I just... what would you know about it, anyway? Look, I'm sorry. This just wasn't supposed to happen. What does that mean? I just can't get involved with someone right now. Whatever. ( TV on ) Hey. Hi. How was your evening? To tell you the truth, even I get tired of hearing about the old days. He looked so cute. ( Laughs ) Old Sam, he's still Trying for it. You gotta love him for that. He knows all about the show. He understands dreams. I told him I was with it a long time. Twenty years at the sands. And the bergere for five years before then. Merry Christmas, sweetie. Speaking of, Sam said he had a little present for you. A little tidbit he said you'd know what to do with. He talks to a few of the girls, and they say they heard about a little arrangement with Tommy over at the horizon. There's these two girls there, and these other girls say that these two sometimes steal chips. The casino won't cash chips for any of the working girls, so these two run it through Tommy. He's scamming the house. He'd be dead in the desert if they found out. I want the word taken off me, Tommy. What's the matter, is somebody watching? Let's go outside. We've been over this before. You gonna call security? If that's what it takes. Good, that'll give me a chance to explain how you've been selling back their own chips to them. I want the word taken off. It's not up to me. There's nothing I can do. Look, I like you, Jackie, I really do. If there was anything I could do you know I would. Okay. I gave you your chance. It's the trick who did it, not me. Yeah? Yeah. He's a heavy guy. He put out the word. So give me a his name. You're gonna get US both a trip to the dump. No, Tommy, just you, when the casino finds out about the chips. I don't know his name. Look, maybe you need some cash. I can spot you a few bucks. Henry Rinaldi. That's his name. You sure about that? Yeah. It's Tommy over at the horizon. Yeah, fine, fine. I, uh, I turned up something I thought Mr. Rinaldi might want to know. (Announcer calling race) Coming down along the inside, but now Mali star is coming on fast. Mali star! I wish you'd brought me another name. But Rinaldi, he's got too much juice. You know him? He's the biggest concessionaire in Reno. Linens, glassware...the whole town runs on his stuff. If Rinaldi don't want you to work in Reno, you won't work in Reno. I'm sorry. You won't do it? I gotta live here too. Woman: Yeah, baby, that's it. Lucky seven. Look, about the other night. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. No, no. I'm sorry. I overreacted and it was stupid and I didn't want it to end like that. I mean... I like you. I like you, too. So what do we do now? ( Sniffling ) I don't know. Don't, don't, don't. Come on. You okay? No. I'm such a mess. It's all right. God, I'm so...- it's okay. It's okay. Ever been to Tucson? Tucson? No. Daria's brother offered me a job there in a hotel. Yeah? Yeah, when she mentioned it I just wrote it off. I mean, here there's people who knew me when I was something. You know, in Tucson or... Anywhere, I'd just be... You. Yeah, me. Well, wouldn't that be a disaster. Joseph, do you really like it here? What? Last week you said you liked it here. Are we gonna move again? I'm just thinking about things. Okay. What's for dinner? How about I go out and get US some burgers? Cool. Okay. Oh, can I have a diet soda as well? Thanks. If people knew where burgers came from, they wouldn't eat them. I know where they come from. Yeah, but if you thought about it... I don't want to think about it. I know here they come from. They come from big, dead cows that are raised in awful, inhumane circumstances. But guess what? They're not human, so I don't give a big one, I'm trying to eat here. Try and understand me on this one, Joey. Joseph. We are the human beings, so we have to eat, and we eat everything... ( Sarah drones on ) Ohh! You fucking whore! ( Overlapping voices ) Joseph: Okay, but... Sarah: But nothing. We're just trying to eat here. Aaaah! Jackie! Honey! Mom! Oh, honey. Hang on a second, honey. She's...she's all right, don't worry about it. Mom! Mommy! Mom! ( Car starts ) ( Tires screech ) ( Thunder crashing ) Radio: The stock market Surged 78 points to record levels today on rumors of federal reserve.. ...off 39 points. Some analysts are predicting a continuation of... ...and option contracts... ( Gunshot ) No, no, no!, no! Please! Don't! No, please, don't! Don't! Shut up! Please, don't shoot! Shut up! You just shut your fucking mouth! I'll give you anything! Please don't shoot me! No! ( Crying ) Please don't shoot me. Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me! I'll give you anything! Please! Please! Please! Please, please, please! How does it feel, asshole? How does it feel, you disgusting piece of shit? You know what? You're not fucking worth it. ( Rinaldi whimpering ) Sweetie? Hey, baby. Oh, I love you, baby. I love you, too. It's over. Oh, my baby. Oh... You okay? Listen, it looks like I can't move in with jeanine after all. I thought it was all arranged. I don't have a choice. Well, why? What happened? It's big Sam. He says either I move in with him or suffer the consequences. Ha ha ha ha! He's turning out to be a pretty desperate character. Oh, my god. Yeah. My mother will be spinning in her grave. I'm really happy for you. Yeah. Oh... Oh! ( Both laughing ) You. Ha ha ha ha! You little slut. Go ahead. Hey, Adam. So why you goin' to Texas? Gonna have a kid. You? Hey, anything's possible. Maybe one of these days I'll bring my kid by and we can all go fishin'. Give me a break. Hey, could happen. So you gonna say goodbye to mom? Yeah. Hey, be good. Hey. Hey. You all packed? Yeah. Drive safe. We'll be all right. I know. I meant that about coming to visit sometime. Any time. Seriously. Seriously? Seriously. Yeah. Okay.
