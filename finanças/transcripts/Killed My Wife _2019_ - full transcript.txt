Shit. Shit. Damn. My head hurts... Who is it? Mr. CHAE? That's me. Your wife Miyoung was murdered last night. What? I'm lieutenant CHOI from Unnam district police. May I come in? Hold on. Miyoung... My wife... She is dead? Yes. They are investigating the scene now. I have some questions for you. Where were you last night? Last night& I had drinks with a friend. Drinks. I sometimes can't remember& Hey, what are you saying? This is just a formality. Detectives asked me to question you. Just basic detective work. Asking about alibi at the time of crime. We heard you two were recently separated. Did you fight a lot? What the heck are you saying? We keep all possibilities open. Usually the victim knows the criminal. Are you saying, "I killed her?" That's not what I'm saying. Shit. You think you can just say whatever you want? [music] It's a misunderstanding. This isn't blood... is it? The friend I drank with yesterday is Jinsu. He works at a large firm. You can talk to him on the phone. Wait... Let me find my phone. You can check my story... What the?! Freeze! No. Hey, hey... Freeze! Don't move. Sir... This is a misunderstanding! It's a misunderstanding! You bastard. No... no way! No... no way! Killed My Wife Shit. Yesterday... 8 hours before the incident. We had an opening, so I thought you would get the job. Yeah. Why would they hire someone who was fired? That's what I talked to HR about. I wanted to let them know you were fired without cause. They told me you had credit issues. Why didn't you tell me? You used up all your severance pay too, right? So that's why you two are separated. No, that's not it. No, no. After that... I can't remember. Shit. What happened to my phone? Hello? Jinsu, are you busy? I told you yesterday. We have an audit this morning. I have something to ask you. About what? I'm very busy now. Come to the office later. Let's have lunch. Hey Jinsu. - Mr. PARK. Hello? I don't have money... Huh? I have to remember. What's going on? Murder? What happened? The woman who just moved in to 106. What about her. It's a murder.. Murder? Her husband wasn't with her? They are separated. Control the residents of this apartment. Yes, sir Hi. Hello. Did you get fingerprint off the door keypad? Yes, sir. Forensic team is nearly done. Let's go in. Honey. I was here last night! I got knocked out by a bum... "Mother-in-Law" Yes, boss. No way. I am at the husband's, but he wasn't here. So, I'm asking around the neighborhood. Yes? What is it? You saw him go out last night? OK. I need to hang up now. Yes. Can't remember because he was drunk? Yeah, right. What's this? "Sejung Construction, PARK Jinsu" PARK Jinsu? Ah, Miyong. 3 months ago, Miyoung signed up for 3 insurance policies. Who is listed as the beneficiary? CHAE Jungho. The husband. Do people often sign up for 3 life insurance policies at once? Yeah. That way you get around $500k. Just 1 policy would only cover the funeral cost. $500k isn't even that much these days. Do you have insurance? No. What? I think the police think I'm the killer. You know what sucks more? I totally can't remember anything. I couldn't answer the police man's questions. I remember going to the rice wine place. Ok. I went to another place with you, right? Where did we go? You can't even remember that? You keep having these blanks in your memory. Ok, ok. That's not the problem here. So, after rice wine, we bought cigarettes... 7 hours before the incident Where do you wanna go now? Let's go to a fun place. Your treat. Fun place? How about you treating me for a change. What are you talking about? I always treat you. Those kids... Hey, hey. Forget it. Those kids will become criminals& Kids are scary these days. Just look away. What the fuck? Sorry. I will buy nice liquor. Let's go. Nice liquor? Yeah. Let's go, go. Hey, don't be like this. What do you know about married life? You aren't even married& Hey. What can I get you? Another bottle, please. Sure. Love needs money, you know? Love needs money, you know? You don't know shit. So just shut up. Then... Then what? Just go home. Tell her that you are sorry. Now? At this hour? Did he really go home? Did anything happen at the bar? What thing? But I left before you did. I told you I had an audit in the morning and you told me to go. I did? So... You know, how... I get angry when I'm drunk. I get angry when I'm drunk. Nothing happened last night. You drank a lot but we just played darts and had fun. Female in her 30s was murdered at her house in Unnam. Police& Hey, you are on the news. The Segment is over. What are you going to do now?

Forensics are working on foot and finger prints. We are checking phone and banking records. Ok. Sir, sir! Which district is this? The uniform looks great on you. You making fun of me? I'm not joking. The police station is very quiet since you left. Where are you going? Buzz off. Sir. Good bye, sir. Lieutenant, why are you so late? Chief is really mad& Cause of death? It looks like blunt weapon trauma to the head is the cause of death. We haven't found the murder weapon yet& Detective PARK thinks it's an unplanned murder. Who would carefully plan to murder his wife? We are going back to the station. We are not working together, but thank you for coming. Let's go. Call me. Let's have a drink. Go. Asshole. You need to calm down. Kimchi restaurant. Restaurant! Good bye. Dickhead. World is full of dickheads. Lieutenant, what did the victim's husband say? He wasn't home. I put out a warrant, so he will be found soon. You know that PARK PARK Jinsu? Did you call him? He doesn't answer. I left a message. Keep calling& I'm gonna check out the scene. If the chief asks, tell him I got here a while back. Yes, sir. Dismissed. Is there some ointment? What's this? Where did he get this money? It's got to be dirty money& 3 hours before the incident Honey. Honey, you didn't change the pass code yet? I told you not to come here drunk. Honey... Always drunk. You are not even going to remember this tomorrow& Did I just leave& Come on. Come on& I couldn't have done it You went to the bar? Did you go to Miyoung after that? Is this the right way? Let's go that way. Excuse me. Hey, it's you. You really came. Do you know me? What do you mean? Wait here. I will be right back. I have some questions. Just wait here. You drank a lot but we just played darts and had fun. Bullseye! I'm sorry. I made you wait a long time. That's ok. Where shall we go? What?! Too fast. Stop. Next, next. What's this? Who's this? It's a girl. Yes. That guy. Did you see it? Hey, that's him for sure. Go back. Yes, that's him. We thought we got him, so we followed him. There was nothing. What? Check this out.

Yeah. I wasn't working last night& How can I check the CCTV over there? -CCTV? -Yeah. I should ask the store manager. Then call him and ask! What? Lieutenant, we met with PARK Jinsu. Yeah? What did he say? He says he met with CHAE Jungho yesterday. So? They went to a bar and then he went home. Bar? Yes. Also Jungho owes some money to loan sharks& That's why they were separated& I'm his only close friend. So, I bought him drinks and told him to shape up. I thought that would be enough, but he just gave up. $50 bills make our jobs so much easier. What are you doing? Sign over here. Oh yes& Thumb print here. Thank you. Do you have any other security deposit? Isn't this enough for now? I'll pay you back soon. I'm sure you will. I told him to go home and see his wife. I hate to say this& But he may have killed his wife and not remember a thing. Jinsu said that? Yes. Where's this bar that they went to? Yeah? Go ahead. I will be there soon. Lieutenant. What now? About the CCTV& How did you know Jinsu was involved with Jungho? When did you join the force? It's been 1 year 6 month and 20 days! I've worked 20 years. You even tipped me. Tip? Did I win some money? Yeah. You won a lot of money. I suck today. Hurry up. 6 hours before the incident Let's go again. $100! I didn't school you enough? Let's go. Whatever. Jinsu, you can't win against me tonight. You know why? Today is my lucky day. It looked like he was losing on purpose. You didn't notice it, and you were really happy& Jinsu, that bastard& What? Never mind. Did I leave after that? I wouldn't be waiting here at this hour if you did. 5 hours before the incident You know what's hot these days? Lottery ticket and Porter. Economy is bad, so they buy Lottery for a jackpot chance. Others buy Porter to make a living. What do they do with a Porter? They can deliver packages and house moving jobs. You wouldn't know about it, right? What? How much do you earn working here? Isn't this job hard? Apply for an accounting clerk at our company. You are pretty, so you won't be fired. What's pretty got to do with the job? That's everything! Dirty bastard. Face is good& Body is& What are you doing? Why? I need to check you out to see if you are fit for the job. Are you okay? I'm not okay. Did we do something to you? What did we do? Bring me another bottle. You broke it, you pay for it. I'm sorry. What kind of attitude is that? Everyone is looking at me. I'm so embarrassed. I just wanted to enjoy a drink. Why are you looking at me like that? You bitch. Hey man. Be quiet. What did you say? There were many people in the bar, but no one helped& They were just watching, so I was really scared& This is on me, so enjoy it. Okay. Shouldn"t you be going? I heard your friend say Tell her that you are sorry! I Love you! Trust me! Ah, right& What did you do so wrong? How old are you? I'm twenty... I told you that it was on me several times. You kept insisting that you would pay... But it was a check that your friend gave you... So, I told you to come back tomorrow afternoon and treat me to lunch... I see...

He killed a person? Lieutenant, he is just a suspect-- Really? Why would he run away if he didn't do it? Welcome. Can I charge my phone? We don't do that... You can plug it into my charger.

Ok. Ok. Thank you. KIM Sojin... Hey Jinsu. Where are you? The police is looking for you. Can you call the police? Ask them if a loan shark named KIM Sojin visited my wife yesterday. Can you find out for me? Why? Is the loan shark the murderer? Why don't you just go to the police and tell them the truth? I will be arrested if I go there. I will go when I have a clear alibi. Hey!! Where are you going? We got the phone records for Miyoung. Last call before her death was with karaoke bar. I'm on my way there. Do you have to take this car? What? I will go. You find out more about Jung ho. What? Lieutenant... Sir... Does he even know the address? Someone was killed! I don't care if you pimped out a girl! Just look the other way this once. Shit. Shit. Hurry up and talk. Do you want to close up shop? It was about one month ago. Ms. KIM brought over a girl. She told me to pimp her out. Good night! Let's talk tomorrow! Tomorrow... Hello? Miyoung, can you do a job now? Yes. Just take care of this client. Ok. Her husband is addicted to gambling. She needed to earn money to pay off her husband's loan. Ms. KIM... Back. Go back a little! Wh-What? Why? They are under the legal age. No way... That's strange... Wait a minute. Yes, lieutenant? Have you heard of Ms. KIM? Ms. KIM? You mean the loan shark, KIM Sojin? Yeah... the loan shark. She used to work for credit cooperative before starting private loan business. She's famous for cutting off arms of debtors for insurance money. How do you know all this? I've been in the force 1 year 6 month and 20 days. Shut up!! Tell me the truth! Actually, PARK Jinsu called me. He told me that Ms. KIM may have visited Miyoung yesterday. He said that? Yes. Also, we just got the convenience store CCTV footage. You are still at that store? Yes... The store manager kept refusing to show us the footage. So, I wasted a lot of time. He sold some liquor and cigarettes to underage kids. Got it. Ok. Copy the footage and send it over to criminal affairs. Hang up! If KIM Sojin threatened Miyoung... CHAE Jungho came to the apartment at midnight. 40 minutes later at 12:40, he is shown leaving on the convenience store CCTV... 20 minutes after that at 1am Miyoung leaves. She comes back home at 2:37. Then the husband is not the killer. But he comes back later. At 4am I told you. Usually the husband is the killer. The estimated time of death is between 3 and 4. 30 minute is enough. Wasn't the loan shark Ms. KIM there too? Ms. KIM... We thought she was a resident here. She came at 3:30 and left 20 minutes later. So we have two suspects? We will be right there. Keep an eye on him. That guy is coming to us. Get your weapons. We won't fail again. Here... If you fail again, you are all dead. I'm gonna hire real fighters to replace you. Yes, ma'am. We will be right back. Call Mr. HWANG. We got a job to do tonight. Mr. HWANG? We are gonna take an eyeball. Tell him to prep for that. [music] Ms. KIM! He is in there. How did... I... Don't come. I am not sure why you came back, but thank you. Ms. KIM. You should have come earlier It's too complicated now. I got you. We are a legit licensed business. We pay taxes on time. No cash exchange for coins! We don't give cash. That'd be suicide. We just run a normal business, but you keep investigating. This isn't right Do you know Ms. KIM? Who? I don't know her. I have no idea. We are a very legit business. Organ collection memorandum, physical exam papers, all set? Yes, ma'am. [Ms. Kim] Get things ready for Mr. HWANG. We don't want to open late like last time. Yes, ma'am.
