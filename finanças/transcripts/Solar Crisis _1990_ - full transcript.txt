It will be the greatest explosive force in the history of mankind. Looking good, Freddy. How you feeling? Terrible. The suspension coils need to be reduced to 2.3%. Reduce coils 2.3. How's that? Yes, better, and thank you, Captain. Thank you for what? For always listening to me and taking me seriously. Sometimes I feel that everyone has grown tired of my constant complaints. They listen to me because I outrank them. Thank you for having me programmed to analyze. I recognize my explosive potential, and I am pleased that you're commanding our mission and for your attention. Goodbye, Captain. We will rendezvous in 38 hours, 13 minutes, 52 seconds. Please mark. Easy does it. Have a safe flight, Freddy. Take good care of yourself. That's what I do best. Chicago, handoff complete. As soon as you get him locked in the cargo bay, you're clear for departure. Treat him gentle, fellas. United Command Starship U.S.S. Helios has arrived. It will shortly begin its journey to the sun. Moving into position. Here it is straight... I don't give a Martian's ass about anything except the performance of my ship. We're traveling 148,800,000 kilometers on a God-damned modified space buggy that's still untested. I've been assigned to this ship since command ordered her into emergency service. Helios will perform as programmed. That's terrific. The project officer gives me her complete assurance. I'm a biogene. I know the Helios like my own heartbeat. We're all specialists. If we weren't, we wouldn't be here. At the odds we're facing, this ship must give us 100% if we're to have just a chance to succeed, a chance to give old mother earth another 10,000 years. All right, Alex, get on with it. Yes, sir. Lieutenant Meeks. It's Bobby. What? Well, darling, my friends call me Bobby. For Christ's sake, Meeks... He's just stroking. Engines are fired up and ready to go. Sir, if I may? Accelerometers indicate momentum converters are operating at peak dynamic saturation. McBride. The big bang left New Trinity aboard cargo ship Chicago. Big bang? The antimatter bomb. Our rendezvous time with the Chicago is now at 33 hours, 9 minutes. Both navigational systems are locked. Skipper, operations are in standby mode. Mission launch will begin at 0600. All right. Navigational coordinates are filed and stand approved by command. One way in. One way out. Mr. Borg. Yes, Dr. Minami. I helped design the ra probe, and I know its limitations. After the explosive is installed in the ra and the Helios is in position to launch it, the ra will need a pilot to guide it to the target area, and I am the most qualified. Dr. Minami, I don't have the authority to make that decision. Hell, I'm just watching the store here. What you're asking is up to the commander of the mission. Yes, sir. I will speak to Captain Kelso. The target area is Region 17. Minami, that's... 15 million frigging degrees. Repent thy sins! Find your salvation! Armageddon is upon us! Armageddon is upon us! Repent! Repent thy sins! Find your salvation! Claire, face the reality. I'm not going to share your guilt. You may be an authority on meteorology, but you're brain-dead when it comes to handling a man like Teague. You're walking on the backs of every suffering human being on this planet. That's a compliment, isn't it? At least I'm moving forward, aren't I? I'm warning you, Dr. Haas... Don't shake the God damn tree. Tell your Mr. Teague the tree's already dead. In Skytown, the Helios approaches countdown. If the chaos in the world continues, IXL will have will have an economic headlock on the food and fuel resources of every nation on earth. You talk as if we had weeks or months. If this Starfire theory occurs, what the hell does it matter? Teague is gambling that Starfire will never happen. By the time the sun's destructive force recedes and life continues as before, this board of directors will control the most powerful financial base the world's ever seen. While everyone is worried about dying, IXL makes a killing. Let's go to Rhonda Hatson live at Skytown where the Helios awaits final countdown. How can you smoke in this heat? In only a few minutes, 16 courageous men and women will journey to the sun, and the prayers of all of us... Sit down, please. I'm not the emperor, but, God damn, I'm hoping someday to be. Dr. Haas, what are the prognosises? Is that a word, "prognosises"? Please run the disc. A consortium of scientists headed by Dr. Griffin and Dr. Paije have determined that Starfire is certain. A mega-flare explosion will vaporize the earth's atmosphere and destroy all life. I told them they were mistaken. The fact is... They are not mistaken. I discovered that my staff and I have miscalculated. The Starfire theory is correct. It is imperative that we support the Helios expedition. It is possible that this antimatter device... A bomb... Could divert the mega flare away from earth and into space. A large solar flare will take place within 48 hours. Dr. Haas, are you absolutely convinced that this catastrophe will happen? There seems to be no question. Doesn't it appear the sunspot group is merging? Looking at the Fraunhofer lines... Is that your expert conclusion? I don't call myself an expert, but... That's right, Dr. Beeson, you're not an expert. Dr. Beeson disagrees with my calculations, she along with a diminishing minority of scientists. They are wrong, and I am right. And what if you're wrong, Dr. Haas? Well, IXL invests in the future, an optimistic future, and I refuse to believe that a mega flare or even God himself, for that matter, is going to end it. That's not how I see it. I see it in terms of the status quo. Yes, sir. I believe the board sees it exactly that way. Thank you, gentlemen, Dr. Haas. Sorry I have to run. I'm on a tight schedule. Call me if there are any new developments. We must abort this ra expedition. Mr. Teague... The expedition will be taken care of. Jesus! They're charting over 200-knot winds down there. Damn it. There's so much electromagnetic interference, communications are almost impossible. What about the optical receivers? They're acceptable, but I'm having a hell of a time decoding. Shuttle's in from New Trinity. Is Kelso aboard? Yeah, yeah. Is he on the money? He can cut it as commander. We used to have a few drinks, few laughs. We used to be friends. Friends? We started in the service together. We flew some missions. Then his wife died. Things changed. Now he's a top dog. Hell, who knows why anything changes? Let's put it this way... That cutting edge between them was competition. It just took off in the wrong direction. Come on, you know, where I come from, you buddy up and give your new friends a great big ol' hug. How's that? Good. Good? How about if I squeeze tighter? Well, I suppose you'll all be wanting friendship. Bobby, I think the lady's got the idea. Yeah. Sorry. Alex, out there, our only security blanket is each other. We all have needs. I just want you to know that we will care about you. Captain Kelso? Hi. I'm Alex Noffe. Captain Kelso... Steve Kelso. Hi. I just thought I should introduce myself since we're going to be working together. Yes. Alex Noffe? Right. Sure. Alex. Command sent me your emergency report. You handled it very well. Thank you. Every system has been monitored and personally verified. My procedure will include all personnel both physically and psychologically. Psychologically? Well, a psychological study of ship personnel under stress will prove very beneficial. Lady, that's nonsense. Did I say something inappropriate? No. Just not too realistic. I was being very realistic. Maybe it's a poor choice of words. Yes, it was. Captain Borg has called a navigational sequence at 1600 hours. Will there be any more questions? No. No? Nice having you aboard, Commander. Captain Kelso reporting as ordered, sir. Knock it off. Hey, you really look lousy. Are you working out? I've been on New Trinity the past three months working with enough antimatter to destroy the earth and the moon. I didn't want you there. Dad, why do you... You volunteered just like you volunteered for that crazy suicide mission. It's not a suicide mission. You're trying so hard to convince everyone you're not protected by your old man. We have to go through this all over again? What am I going to tell your son? I tried getting him here. I couldn't get the call through. He ran away from that stupid military academy I told you not to send him to. Wait a minute. Is he O.K.? Have you heard from him? I just told you he's AWOL. Don't blame the boy. I probably would have done the same thing. I just had it in my head to take a dropship down and find him myself. You can't do that. I can do anything I want to. I'm the admiral. I've got to get over to the Solab. Hold it, damn it! You tell me you love me before you leave this room. I love you. I love you, too. Tango, tango! This is Beddington Control. We have neg... Great. The Starfire scenario is on threshold. I don't have to tell you what those at home are facing. If this monster sun flare reaches the Mercury orbit, the earth's surface would become glasslike. Estimated deaths... 50%, and if this monster flare reaches the Venus orbit, the earth's surface would become magma. Estimated deaths... 90%, 90% of human life... And if this megalo flare reaches the earth... Complete destruction. Alex. These magnetic tubes are like elastic bands. Stretched beyond the threshold, they snap... causing a solar flare. This tube, as you can see, is giant and wound much more tightly than any before. And if it snaps... This is the region we need to penetrate, region 17. Here we will prematurely trigger the flare on the far side of the sun. The Helios and the Ra are both protected from the sun's heat by electromagnetic barriers using the superconductive coils. It's going to be damn hot. We won't burn up, though. The barriers will work. As you were. Now, we don't have much time. Originally the Helios was to travel to New Trinity where we'd load our antimatter device into the probe Ra and then proceed to the sun. Once in orbit, trigger the flare, and then home free. Good Lord willing. To save time, the space barge Chicago is going to carry our bomb to meet us en route. We will rendezvous with the Chicago, then on to the sun. With 5 tons of antimatter? A miracle. Now for the bad news. Since we haven't completed testing the guidance system on the probe and we don't know what the electromagnetic interference is going to do, we can't afford sending it into the sun without human backup. Originally the probe was built with a pilot's seat. We were hoping we'd never have to use it, but we cannot risk a malfunction or a computer error, so one of us is going to have to pilot the Ra. O.K., loading process begins as of now. Good luck. The transmission and communication interruptions are once again predicted over much of the north and south midlatitude regions. Helios, with the solar penetrator Ra, will leave Skytown today to rendezvous with the Chicago and carry the antimatter to the sun. A worldwide vigil... Economists predict that even if the solar instabilities end with the Helios mission, it may take years before world financial markets recover. Scientists warn of the possibility of the total collapse of the global food chain. Hah! You like baseball? Yes, sir. Who's winning? Who's winning what, sir? Baseball! Dodgers. How long does it take this thing to fill back up? Are you shitting me? Ha ha! I knew it. I knew they'd kick ass. I knew it. I'm Mike Kelso, sir. Hear that note? I hear a lot of them, sir. A lot of notes out there, kid. You got to find the one you like and grab on to it. Makes sense. Shit! Wait! Where are you going? Sir, where are you going? Where the hell are you going? Up there. There's nothing up there but pain. My dad and my grandpa are up there... Skytown. I've got to get to Red Sands and catch a shuttle. Damn it. Please, sir, you have to listen to me. I'm running out of time. My dad is the commander of the mission to the sun. You have to understand this is probably the last chance I'll ever get to see him again. I escaped from Beddington. They're looking for me right now. You got to understand. This school's real heavy on discipline. If I don't make that space shuttle, I'm going to be in serious trouble. Sir? Will you please take me to Red Sands, sir? You requested a list of all personnel who can pilot the Ra. Is your name on the list? There are five us, including you. I should be at my station. Ra alignment looks good. Inertial stabilizer full on. 30 meters. Docking system switching from Skytown control to Helios control on my mark. Mark. Handoff acknowledged. Initiate terminal docking sequence. Helios docking collar is green. We'll switch to external power upon hookup. 15. Inertial stabilizers drifting. Confirm and correct. Slow her down to 78. Confirmed. Looking nice and center. Just keep bringing her on in. Pads open and ready. And we have a marriage. Helios, we have a major problem. Confirmed. Emergency! What are you doing? What happened? Outside fuel line ruptured. I want a damage report! We have a jam-up. What's going on up there? Problem's not up here. We're losing pressure. Try a system's bypass. That's not it. It's internal. We need to open this thing up. If we lose her... We lose the mission. We lose everything. Lamare, increase magnification. We have it located, captain. Try it now. Lights on all panels are green. Confirmed, Helios. Connectors free and clear. Docking collar's open and tracking. Ra is locked into docking sequence. It was a hard dock. Switching Ra over to external power. It worked? Perfectly. Looking good. Entering loading dock. Decrease forward motion 20%. IXL maintenance crew is needed at control bay level B for launching changeover. Preflight checks will be done on level D. Captain. Yes. Kelso here. The admiral asked for flight clearance on dropship bay number 5. We thought that since you're his son... Dropship deployment. Prepare for hatch closure and depressurization. Please clear the docking area. Caution. Dad! What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm going down to find your son. There's already an army down there searching for him. I'm going after my grandson. Dad, get the hell out of there! If you'd thought about the boy, gave him a little time... Thought about him? I have done nothing but think about him. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm under a lot of pressure. How the hell can he say that to me? Ha ha. Sir, I wanted to thank you. I wanted to thank you for helping me out. You know, sir? Sir, it'd be a lot easier if I knew your name. You are in violation! Clear the highway! You are in violation! Clear the highway! Hang on! Well, we got a patch? Yup! I got a patch. I just don't got any air. Hey, sir! We got somebody coming! There's a truck headed this way, sir! You are in violation! Clear the highway! You are in violation! Clear the highway! Those things won't stop for nothing. Unless... unless something stands in its path, and then I think... That they're programmed to stop, I think. Hey, hey, hey! Look, look, look! Hey! Hey, look! You are in violation! Clear the highway! Get out of the way, sir! Clear the highway! Please! You are in violation! God. God. Sorry about your bike, sir. Maybe they only stop for living people. That's something we don't want to find out. Those things go from point a to point Z, and that's all they know. Great. Here comes another one. Rarr! Rarr! Sir, stop! You don't know what you're doing! Rarr! Stop, please! Get away from me! No! Please! Sir, you don't know what you're doing! Clear the highway! You are in violation! Clear the highway! Please! You are in violation! Clear the highway! You are in violation! Clear the highway! Let's go. You are in violation! Clear the highway! Let's go. Come on. Born? We're all created in one way or another. Honey, I'd say your way was a hell of a lot better. Where did this creation happen? In a laboratory in Oxford, England. Mother? Unknown. What about the babymaker? You know, the old man. Sorry. Also unknown. I was fertilized in a test tube. All right, let's hop to it. We're about to fly into Abraham's Bosom. The whole galaxy is heaven to you. You call it heaven? My mom told me that heaven feeds the stars. Did you know that? No. When you're out there, it's staggering. It's timeless, ageless. Maybe it's even eternal. There's only one problem. While the captain's busy storming the gates of heaven, the rest of us are headed straight to hell. Alex Noffe, biogenetically-enhanced human, biogene labs, Oxford, England. Specialization... logician. Bred and trained for enhanced physical and mental capabilities. Status... experimental prototype. Medical aid is currently being flown in. Millions of dollars have been donated from public and private sources. The death toll here is in the hundreds of thousands. Mr. Teague's office. Claire, you wouldn't believe the view. Mark coordinates 4-5-12-9-12-1... And 8. Nexus. Biogene now coded Delilah. Tell Mr. Teague he can play her like a piano. Too bad, Delilah. I am the only one that can ever free you. Initiate the rcs and give me an immediate scan range. Range 9-800. Hold on, Chicago. Delta, come back. At EP-171. Talk to me. Use the backup sequence. Rendezvous point set at vector 05.007. Your environmental, sir. Switching to internal power, sir. Helios, you have docking collar disengaged. Lock in course and initialize nab sequence. Go right till we have clearance. Let's roll. Navigational panels have been calibrated. All lights are green. Engines powering up to standby. Squibs armed and ready. Go for internal power. Helios to Skytower control. Separation is complete. Bow connectors disengaged, and she's free as a bird. All systems are automated. Meeks, I need a straight-up reading. Roger, T.C. We're on line. We reach Max in... 21 seconds. Hey, T.C., did I ever tell you I'm mad about you? I know you, Meeks. All you want to do is chew face. Captain! Alex, you're shaking like a leaf. Let go of me. Let go of me! Get a medic! You looked... Looked what? Skytower control to Helios. Begin pitch-over maneuver. We have confirmation of complete antenna deployment. Helios is clear. Switching over control. Good luck and Godspeed. Aft thruster level is 0012. We're clear. We got a green on coolant turbos. I'm all ears. What's this sudden emergency, as you put it? Our... Thank you. Our beautiful Dr. Beeson here... Tells me there's a strong possibility the ra mission might actually succeed. Does she? Are you Teague's personal adviser now, too, Claire? Not really. Teague, I'm pleading with you. The ra mission is our only chance for survival. Dr. Haas, hi. My company invests in the future. I've invested my ass in food, seeds, water. I've invested my ass in you. Teague, I'm begging you. There's no doubt that Starfire will happen. The Ra mission, even though the risk factor is enormous, it can succeed. It won't succeed. I've made sure of it. I wasn't going to tell you anything, but when Claire unwittingly spilled the beans, it would be a mistake to think that anything would slip by you. You're committing murder against the world. I'm warning you. I won't keep quiet. I won't. Teague, we're running out of time! It's murder! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Stop! Hey! Teague, please! No! Teague! No, I'll die out here! Teague, please! Sir? Yeah, what? I don't mean to pry or anything, but... You never told me what your name was. That's 'cause... I like the way you call me sir. There's a kind of a... Majestic ring to it. So, what do you do? I'm a creator. My name is Travis. Travis. I... I don't remember my last name. I know that it starts with an "R." It's kind of, really simple, like Ryan or Randy. Rob... Rob... Robe... Rhodes? Get down! You are in violation! Clear the highway! You are in violation! Clear the highway! Obstruction of a robotic transport vehicle is prohibited by law. Failure to comply will result in a declaration of an emergency and a notification of IXL security. I repeat. You are... failure to comply... Ha ha ha ha! Hey, would you look at that? It's old Travis. Hey, colonel... What in the hell are you doing in there? I didn't know you were a colonel. Check this out. I got a dropship coming in from Skytown unscheduled. Admiral, good to see you again, sir. Commander, I don't believe what they just told me. You still haven't found him. That's correct, sir, but we... No buts! I want five choppers out at all times. I want a vertol for me personally... Sir, they found his chopper charred in the middle of Gila Flats. We've had violent sandstorms, sir, and the chances of him surviving that kind of heat, those conditions, they're just... How do you know it's his chopper? Do they have nameplates on those things? No. Commander, I want you... I want you to... Comb that desert till you find him. Commander. I know. Take this. See what you can do. How's she doing? Still trying. Bridge, air lock. Yeah, what is it? We got a major problem here. We got a serious vibration problem in the engine coolant turbo. The bleed valves are jammed open, and they're dumping coolant into the ionization chamber. I tried to equalize it. Get Alex on it. She's on it. Still can't figure it out. Emergency coolant status. We're in trouble down here! We got a radiation leak... Sir. How's it looking? The coolant leaking into the ionization chamber is causing a buildup of pressure. If we don't equalize it within 15 minutes, one of those engines will blow a vertol-sized hole through this ship. Don't tell me what might happen. Give me a solution. What if we shut off the turbo pumps? No, we'd overheat. The tanks would burst and... Sayonara. Emergency shutdown procedures in effect. Get a man suited up. Get him out there. We'll fix it manually. That would be a dead man. Once the pressure equalizes, the plasma and coolant will trigger an explosion. Whoever's out there will get killed. What do you suggest, Commander? Give me an alternative. O.K., captain. Which one? It's your pick. All crew evacuate lower engineering level. Emergency. Radiation level in engineering bay unacceptable for human maintenance operation. Thermal levels exceed design limits. Correct and verify. Shit, I'll do it. No way. We need you here. Somebody else. Lieutenant Meeks. Yes, sir. Listen to me, Meeks. Everyone dies. Everyone's soul goes someplace. I'll tell you one thing. Yours is going straight to heaven nonstop. You hear me? O.K. Now, try not to look directly into the engine ports. And move quickly. The radiation... Shit. I wish there was another way, Meeks. Hey... Maybe I'll make it. All right, Lieutenant, get ready for depressurization. Clear air lock for depressurization. Let's go, Lieutenant. Tunnel access closed. Pressurization equalized. Seal it once he gets through. You O.K., buddy? I'm sound. O.K., Meeks, engine access panels disengaged. You should have a clear shot through. Radiation levels in turbo areas... What could have caused this? I don't know. Meeks, we lost the sensor at 250-C. It's going to get hotter, buddy. Warning. Warning. Radiation at third level is hazardous. Go for it, Bobby. There it is. The turbo pump's staring right at me. That's good. Come on. You're looking good. Come on. Come on. Right on. Come on now. You're doing great. There's a problem, Captain. Engine status critical. The isolator valve is wide open. Meeks, we've got a frozen isolator valve. Isolator valve's frozen. It's not stuck. It's on lock hold. What? Cut it! Bio-status critical. Heart rate... 190. Blood pressure... 165/110. Approaching terminal status. Man. Come on, man. Come on, Meeks. Hurts to breathe. It hurts to breathe. Let me get in there. Meeks, Meeks, you're almost there. Just breathe slowly. Slowly fill your lungs. My oxygen tanks are roasting. I can't take this. God, help me. You're almost there. Almost there. Help me. Talk to me, somebody! Help me. Help me! Bullshit! Get him out of there! There's no other way. Get him out of there! God, help me! Help me! 30 seconds. God! Help! Help me! Help me! Shit! Green lights on C-2 section. Thermal and radiation levels decreasing. Coolant flow is back to normal, sir. Immediate maintenance inspection required in engine access areas c-3 and C-4. I'm sorry, sir. Emergency situation canceled in engineering sections. Emergency situation canceled in life support area. Borg! Sir! Engineering access to all radiation containment systems operational. All right. Everybody back to work. And are within operational limits in engineering sections. Life support systems restored in all areas. Initiating radiation dispersion systems in engine area C-2. Bio dat. Lieutenant Jetson Tracy Meeks. Born Chicago, Illinois, February 17, 2021. Specialization... Cryogenics and propulsions. Alex. Help me! Alex? Alex, I need to talk to you. How could you let him suffer like that? Why didn't you pull him out? I had no choice. I don't know what's happening. My friend's dead. We're all going to be dead. You're wrong. We are going to live. We are going to make it, and you got to believe that. Help me. Townsend, take your unit to the back side. Sir, we contacted his friends. We heard he might have gone... Probably went AWOL. No, he didn't go AWOL. Of course not, sir. That's not the way it's going to look. That's not what I mean... With me. First time I heard about those damn solar flares, I thought, "get him up to Skytown "where I can keep an eye on him. Call his school, have them send him up." "No, no," he said, "dad wouldn't like that. I'd have to go AWOL." "O.K.," I told him. "You do that." That's what I would have done... And he did. He's my grandson. He's just a kid. Now my son's flying into that inferno, that bloody suicide mission. I... I could have ordered him off that. I could have, but I didn't. Now maybe I lost them both. Gurney, get away from here a minute, will you? Sir... We'll find him for you. I promise. Needle nose 1, we're going to need some daylight sprayed on Q2. Give us a hand. Fighting has broken out in Casablanca after a demonstration of the IFD. Toobig states that he doesn't want to see any more violence and has alerted the military... Two ice waters. Please. Can I get mine with lemon, if you got it. We don't have any lemons. It's 2.50 including tip. Large families of locusts have been migrating through Atchison, Kansas, devouring all vegetation that stands in their path. Exterminating squads are at the scene. Rioters have been flooding the downtown streets of Tokyo in an uproar, setting fires, leaving behind a trail of badly beaten bodies. Riot squads have been fighting hard to suppress the violence but with little to no avail. You see... The way I figure it... This solar crisis has brought the whole world together, and if this mission succeeds... Which, of course, it will... Imagine what the world's going to be like. United world. Travis... You O.K.? Don't cry. Ooh... Thank God. Please, you... you got to help me. Please, I've got to tell somebody. Please help. Freddy's giving us a green light, sir. O.K., bring him on in. Reduce containment vectors 2.7 degrees left. Suspension coils nearing end of travel should also be lowered, 3.14 to be precise. Spider zone 2, ready to hand off for manipulator.

Shall I process your entire file? No, Freddy, that won't be necessary. I find we're a lot alike, aren't we, Alex? Alike? No, Freddy, you're wrong. We're not alike at all. Red Sands? What do you guys want to go there for? Skytown. My friend's the one that's going there. No shit, space. All right, but you know this baby only holds two. Yeow! Sounds great. Thanks, man. You went to the academy at Beddington? Yes, sir. I was a cadet. But... but that's crazy. Who would want to do that? Teague. What did he say? Hey, kid! Hey. Hey... Let's go. I'm sorry about this. I found somebody to take you to Red Sands. Let's go. You don't rob a dying man. I'm going to try and notify somebody he knows. "Dr. Gunther Haas, IXL corp." Travis. Yeah? That guy in there... He told me something. What did he tell you? He spoke Latin to me. He said that some guy named Teague from IXL was trying to sabotage the Helios mission. No kidding? Ooh. Vaya con dios, friend. Where are you going to go now? There's a beautiful note out there. I can hear it. I'm going to reach out and grab it while I'm still young and... And the chicks dig me. Excuse me, sir. There's a message coming through for you. It's a lead, and it seems valid. He got sunstroke pretty bad. Is he sleeping now? He's dead now. I'm the one that called you. I didn't know what else to do. I mean, there's no doctors here. When did you find him? They brought him in from the desert. He was shaking really bad. He was delirious. He spoke to this kid wearing a uniform... You know, one of those military school uniforms. What did he say to the kid? Well, I couldn't tell because they were speaking in a different language. The cadet, where did he go? Well, I don't know. I mean, he came in with that old man. He was there just a second ago. How can I help you? We're looking for that kid you were hanging out with. Yeah, I just met him at the bar. I never did catch his name. Maybe I... Maybe I just didn't ask. Shoot... We were hoping you did. Jesus Christ! You all right, kid? What the hell was that? What are you guys, crazy? You almost killed us here. What's going on here? Now, soldier boy, you tell me every word that fool Haas told you. Hello, Freddy. Hello, Dr. Minami. We're going to run through a quick system check. Are you set? Yes, sir. Good. Did you know I only had 10 annihilation events during the loading? They had the suspension coils set too high, but I told them to decrease their bandwidth. That was smart of you, Freddy. Yes, I feel that it was, Dr. Minami. I don't think that people really understand how sensitive I am. They think that I complain too much. I can hear them bantering. I have good ears. Do you think they're right? Do you think that I complain too much, Dr. Minami? No, no, not at all, Freddy. I wish that I was a ranked officer, then I would be taken more seriously. No, people do take you seriously, Freddy. O.K., but I'll tell you what, I'll put in a good word with the captain, have him make you... An ensign... Or better yet... A lieutenant. That would be wonderful... A lieutenant. Good. Minami? Hi, Alex. Hi, Freddy. Hello, Alex. My computer card's messed up. I don't know what's wrong. Mind if I borrow yours? Sure, but just get it back to me when you're through. Alex, did you know Dr. Minami will see to it that I become a ranked officer? That'll be very nice for you, but it soon won't make any difference. It matters to me. I'm told I'm to be a hero. Isn't that true, Dr. Minami? Yes, Freddy. We'll both be heroes. Lieutenant? Sir? Kill the battery. Yes, sir. I don't know if it was Beddington or not. I do know that it was one of those cute little military school uniforms. Where was he going? I don't know. He was hanging out with this old guy. The old guy, is this the one who died? No. It was this other guy. He had white hair and a face like rotten leather. What's the big commotion with this kid anyway? This is the second time I've been questioned... Second time? When was the first? These corporate types came in asking questions... Corporate types? Like from that big company, something with letters. IXL corporation? Yeah. They took his wallet. Find out about that bunch. Everything. And that guy that wrote the book. Teague. Teague, yeah. He runs the company. Can I go now, sir? Yes. Thank you very much. Are you all right, sir? Yeah. Go ahead. I'll be right with you. Give me a scotch straight up. Sir, do you think you should? No, I shouldn't. Yes, sir. Corporal, let's get these men out of here. That's O.K. On the house. Thanks. Excuse me. I like your hat. Step aside, son. Take it off. I don't think so. Thanks. O.K., that's enough. Calm down. What do you know about the Ra mission? He didn't hear you. Travis? Travis? Travis. Can you hear me? Talk to me. I want you to concentrate on living. Can you do that? Travis? Tell me what your last name is. Can you remember? Richards. Travis... James... Richards. Travis? Travis? Travis James Richards. Sir. Monitors show proton flux levels at counter saturation. Region 17 is showing accelerated merging. We will care about you... Care about you... Care about you... God. We just blew an oxygen tank. Captain, we need you down here immediately. Coming. Auto-pressure emission standby. Malfunction in system 12. What's the problem? This ship's the God damned problem! Nothing works. Nothing! Borg! Borg! Shut off that oxygen! Get that valve shut down! But, sir, we'll have no air! It won't go off! Get back! We're losing pressure on the port engine. What's the damage? The emergency bypass valves are jammed. Then blow them apart! Just get me an answer! Watch his head, watch his head. Captain... It's someone on the ship. There's too much going wrong. Someone is sabotaging... I don't think I'm going to make it. Borg, we're all going to make it. Harvard. Captain, how bad is it? Minami, why don't you tell me? How would I know that? It's bad, O.K.? It's real bad. Harvard, how long to come up with a printout of the crew security I.D.S. Which have accessed, altered, or reprogrammed systems in the last 24 hours? Why? I asked you a question, Lieutenant. How long? It'd take a while. Do it. Captain, the tanks are back on. We lost 63% of the oxygen. That's not enough to get us back home. I guess we don't go home, do we? Why are you trying to sabotage the Helios expedition? That's what Haas told you? I'll tell you why. Because the world isn't going to be engulfed in flames. I don't think it's right to mess around with nature anyway. You ever read nostradamus? Several things are supposed to occur first. Yeah, if I recall. One is that the antichrist will walk the face of the planet. Only thing is... He doesn't walk. He flies high above infernos so he doesn't have to witness the suffering at eye level. My dad told me one thing that I'll never forget. He said that you can be as smart and as brilliant as you like. But never let your ambitions grow bigger than your heart. Sounds like a good man. He is. Only the way you've arranged things, I'll never get to see him again. Right. The son of bitch has cornered everything edible on earth... Meat, fish, grain stockpiled up to his ass. It's not against the law, admiral, for a corporation or an individual to invest in futures. Futures? Where is he? Could be anywhere. He's an extremely busy man. How would you get hold of him? He carries a portable phone, but that doesn't tell me where he is. Set up a tracker. Can you get a fix on that portable phone, son? I can do that, sir. Scientists. The world's full of experts and scientists who say God has spoken through them. One thing I've learned... No one knows anything. All their theories change like the tide. Don't look at me like that. I'm not that predictable. Water, water everywhere! Kill the kid. Take care of Mr. Teague. I'll call in to be picked up. Make it easy on yourself, kid. Hey, kid! A coward dies a thousand deaths. Remember, kid... Only the end results get tallied. My grandfather said the same thing. Back off. I don't want to shoot you. You don't have a choice. Skytown, this is Helios. Do you read me? Skytown, this is Helios. Do you copy? Keep on it. Mike! Mike! Mike. Grandpa. You said I'd be O.K. Thank God. I thought I'd lost you. Come on. Anything? I'd give these instruments a hand job if it would help me get through. Damn it, I need a damage report on the aft thrusters. We're working on it! Well, that is not good enough! Kelso, get out of my face. I'm handling it! No, no, no. Forget that. Listen to me. It is vital you get that message to Helios. Repeat... vital you... This is admiral Kelso. Kelso. Admiral Kelso. Who am I talking to? Avery, sir. We're trying to get the message through. All we're getting is static. Too many ions bouncing around out there. They're just too close, sir. Keep trying, son. Yes, sir. Keep trying. At this speed, we're going to crawl into that solar flare. Borg may be hurt, but he sure as hell isn't dead. Sir, something's coming through. Must be a code. All I can make out is... "Delilah." What or who in God's name is Delilah? We're hours behind schedule. If we don't move, earth is history. Why don't you get behind and push? Alex, status on available power. Alex! We're rerouting. How long? I don't know. What do you think will keep this ship together when we do get it? She'll hold. She'll hold. Weather report says rain. Good news for the farmers. Hold it! Don't waste it! It's a damn hologram. They got a fix on him. He just took off. Get a new tracker. I want confirmation. Destroy him. Yeah. Harvard. Sir. Tell me whose security card this number belongs to... Delta tango 9800 dash 17 kilo Lima... Dash unsf. Ken Minami, sir. Minami? Why, that doesn't make any sense. Captain, we're approaching critical orbit. All right, T.C. Call down there. I want Minami pulled off the Ra immediately. Do it. But if he doesn't pilot the Ra, then who does? 90%. 90%! Pilot the bomb. Complete destruction. That's right. We'll both be heroes. She'll hold. You awake? Manual detonation in t minus 6 minutes, 10 seconds, and counting. Freddy. Cancel manual detonation. Manual detonation, T-minus six minutes and counting. Freddy, you're my friend. Stop it. 5, 9, 4, 4, 9, 12, 12, 5, 1, 1. You've injured your friend. Help me. Help me. Nexus. Nexus. Delilah. Delilah. Free, free. Nexus, Nexus. Delilah, Delilah. Delilah. Is he alive? If he is, I say we blow that bastard out the air lock! Shut up, McBride! Manual detonation, T- minus 5 minutes, 40 seconds, and counting. We've got code blocks all over the place. I repeat, logic pathways are blocked. Minami's dead. We've got to abort Ra, sir! No! With less than five minutes, there's not enough time! Disarm it. That's the only way. Bridge! Kelso. Sir! I need Alex down here now! Shut up, everybody! Shut up! T.C., find her! Yes, sir. Manual detonation, T-minus five minutes and counting. Manual detonation, T-minus 4 minutes, 30 seconds. Her right eye... She's got blood in it. The right eye. Alex, listen to me. Wake up. Freddy's set to detonate. What's the matter with her? What is it? It's strange, sir. Her right eye isn't dilating. Everything seems fine. Get her into the probe. I want her near Freddy. Everybody else, get back to your stations. Back to stations! Back to stations! Let's go! Now! Harvard, how's it coming? Not good, sir. We've got several systems backups, but I can't get into any of them. Some code won't allow me. Can you break the code? Man, we won't even go home in body bags. McBride! Now, look! Everyone get their shit together! That's an order! Manual detonation, T-minus 2 minutes, 45 seconds, and counting. Come on. Alex, Freddy's set to be detonated. You have got to wake up! You've got to come out of this! Alex, wake up! Bridge, Kelso. What's going on up there? We're close to something, sir. I think we just might have it. Manual detonation, T-minus 2 minutes, 20 seconds, and counting. Alteration. Backup systems accessed. Please verify security signature code with authorized voice sample. This is lieutenant Gordon Harvard Clark. This is the way my voice sounds. Mark... two minutes, and counting. Voice sample not recognized. God help us. Come on, come on. Suck it up. Harvard, can we enter new voice I.D.S? Sir, we keep getting the same thing every time we try... unrecognized. There's only two people on this ship Freddy will respond to in this situation... Ken Minami and Alex Noffe... And they're both out of commission. I don't have any ideas left. Harvard, find prerecorded tapes on either Alex or Minami! Maybe we can trick the computer! Where would I find prerecorded tape, sir? Alex' bio. There's a voice sample on Alex' bio. Manual detonation, T-minus one minute and counting. Backup systems accessed. Please verify security signature code with authorized voice sample. Alex Noffe... Biogenetically enhanced human. Fertilization date... may 1, 2025. Recognized. Alex Noffe. Prerecorded sample. Please verify with live voice sample. Manual detonation, T-minus 30 seconds and counting. Ca... Manual detonation, T-minus 10 seconds... 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2... Cancel manual detonation code! Alex Noffe. Recognized. Manual detonation mode canceled. Captain? Freddy, what happened? I was programmed manually to detonate. I know that, Freddy. Who? Who reprogrammed you? Alex Noffe, sir. Why? I don't know why. They got inside my head. I couldn't stop them. I couldn't. I'm sorry. Who, Alex? I don't know! I didn't want to. Captain, sir, we're approaching region 17. If we don't launch Ra within the next few minutes, we'll lose our window. Sir? Sir, we're all set to launch here. We just need to know if we have a pilot. Do we have a pilot? Hello, sir! We have a pilot. Sir, who? Who's the pilot? Harvard, how much oxygen do we have left? We're at 31%... Enough to get us a third of the way. All right. Listen to me carefully. Shut down all nonessential systems. Set up a rendezvous with the Chicago. They'll get you home. Yes, sir. If this ship blows, at least I'll have the satisfaction of watching this come out by the roots. Out of here. It's the wrong decision. The decision has been made! I can't trust you! I don't understand it. I don't understand why I didn't see it. I tried to tell you. You have to believe that. Please try to understand that for some insane reason, somebody or something wanted us to fail. People are dead because of you! What's going on inside your crazy head? I was programmed to. I don't know the reasons. You would have murdered us. I never knew that I could feel such sorrow, such shame... Or that I could feel about any man the way I feel about you, Steve. I could never lie to you. Please let me pilot the Ra. Let my life mean something. Impossible. One minute to target. It is possible. Countdown procedures for ra have been initialized and are in full effect. Captain. Captain. Hello, sir. Do you read? Crew to emergency stations. Cautioned... Maintenance operation in cargo bay area now terminated in preparation for cargo bay door... Forgive me. Cargo bay area cleared and pressurized. Crew to emergency stations. Something's going on. All external codes are to be evacuated... Alex! Alex! Alex! Too late. Get out of there! Damn her! God damn it! We've got to get out of here! Son of a bitch! Cargo bay area cleared and pressurized. Auto systems checked and initiated. Antimatter confinement active within range. Deflections enabled. We'll keep in contact as long as we can. Do you read me? Copy and respond. Stand by. Hull field strength, 20%. Alex, you have systems go. Photosphere temperature, 6,420 degrees and climbing. Reverse thrust deactivated. Freddy? Yes, Alex? I wish you could see what I'm seeing. Describe it. She's gone, Steve. It's over and done. Take us home. Forgive me. Captioning made possible by vidmark entertainment captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
