Uncle, come! Help me! You're a strong one. Becassine, why is your hand clasped? My tooth is in it. I don't want to lose it. Goodnight, Pa. Goodnight, Ma. Morning, Trumpet. Becassine, you look sad as stone. Are stones sad? Yes. Then so am I. The tooth fairy didn't come. Yes, she did. Your parents' snoring scared her. Go pinch their noses so they stop scaring her. Go on. What's wrong? The tooth fairy didn't come? Yes but she's mean. She left me a goat turd. A goat turd? Let me see. My goodness, how amazing! This is wonderful. What's wonderful? This is the seed of a very rare tree. - Very rare? - Yep! A tree that's... blue. Later, you can tell it your secrets and it will console you. Can it console the rabbit too? The blue tree will only console you. Take good care of it. Think where you want to plant it. It's important. What's your favorite spot? D 17 GUINGOIG Farewell, little seed turd. "The marriage of the Prince and Princess, "the splendor of which was... esse.. "essep... "esseptional, "was held in the King and Queen's castle." I'm sorry... I was dreaming of a duck. I caught a big duck. You hunt, Uncle? But now I'm more in a camouflage phase to sense and observe the prey. But tomorrow I'll hunt. I'll shoot up a storm, trust me. "Beests and burds, tyme to run! "Uncle Corentin is hunting tomoro" I'm not even scared. Marquise, help me! "Beests..." Becassine? Becassine? - Feeling better? - Yes. I don't have any half-pint clothes! Yes, I do. There's always this. It's pretty, picturesque. - It's beautiful! - Yes. It'll do the trick for now. Step over there. Try it on. You're stunning! Your parents must be worried. They're already out in the fields. They're brave. They want me to learn a trade. You're the right age. You're a big girl now. If you do well, you can go to Paris. Pretty girls like you run the show there. I'd like to go to Paris, but to see Paris. The Eiffel Tower, the department stores... cars... Wait. For you. What a pretty umbrella! With a duck head. I found it in Paris. At the Samaritaine. An enormous store. Don't open it indoors! It brings bad luck. If I open it outside, it'll get wet. Get going. It's simple, miss. You sew these initials "RG", idem on the other napkins. Yes, ma'am. RG - IDEM D 17 PARIS 473 Pull harder than that! Hello, Marie. Move it, you ass! Uncle, I know you're there. I'm going to Paris. You're leaving today? Yes. Tell me. Will you water my blue tree? Yes. The second I see the Eiffel tower, I climb it! Goodbye, Becassine. Move! Run! Well done! Run! Stop! That's it. Sure you want to leave? You'll still tend to old lady Loingebeuil's calves? I'm sick of calves, harvests, laundry, grape-picking.... Look at Riteuche's daughter. She found a job in a fancy area. Paris is far. You can't afford the train. I'll do odd jobs along the way. Come here! PARIS Signs for Paris already? It's not that far! There it is! Here I come, Paris! Here I come! What a beautiful car! It was the Marquise. Come on... it's the crank! First I'll check the carburetor. If you'd been more forceful... I think it's the carburetor, sir. You didn't check before? I checked everything, Marquise. But flukes... Or the sparkplugs. I knew this ride was a bad idea. - It was your idea. - Mine? - You want a slap? - No. Too late. That's the third time. Enough already! Give me that child immediately! Never touch it again. Marquise, at that age, they're raised like calves. Besides, a smack never hurt anyone. Take me. You're dismissed. Leave the car now. And my pay? Come by tomorrow for your pay. Get going. Let go! Criminal! Dirty wretch! Stop, she scares me. She's evil. Marie! She's crazy. Hey! Don't tell my dad. He slap again me for losing the job. All right. Find this binkie, Cyprien. In the distance did appear hummingbird that grew near She sat upon the branch Oh little rascal, here you are... Such silly words. Well, you could sing along. I can do birdsongs. - So do it. - I will. Watch me. What a sweetie! Too cute. Little darling! Sugar plum! It's a little girl. Hello, little girl. Does your heart ache? - No. - Dried sausage. I don't know which one is the binkie. She is love, like all loves reunited. - Where are you going? - Paris. The Guingois station is 8 miles behind. Paris is 285 miles ahead. I'm in no rush. - What's your name? - Loulotte! - Louise-Charlotte, but we say... - Loulotte. You're the father? Miss... Adalbert, that's enough. She's a poor thing we adopted, the child of my former gardeners who... Just awful. It was just awful. Why don't you come to the house? We don't have a nurse to help with Loulotte tonight. We can't pay her. Step into the car, Miss...? Becassine. This is Mr. Proey-Minans, my right-hand man, my... Anyway. Let's get going, Cyprien! King of the crank! What a slowpoke! What's she doing? Thank you, miss. It's nothing. Like pumping water from a well. This girl is good. Learn from her, Cyprien. Can you go faster? Put him down. Yes, ma'am. Hilarion, see to Miss Becassine, who'll see to Loulotte tonight. Yes, ma'am. Hilarion, take this junk. Oh, no... Dick! How could you? Where do you think you are? Marquise, help me! Follow me, please, Miss Becassine. You can just call me Becassine. Yes, miss. I'll show you to your room. Give her a peck instead. A little peck! See, that wasn't hard. Water! No water. Water. So this is "running water". It runs. It's extraordinary. A magpie in the pear tree I hear the magpie sing A magpie in the pear tree I hear it sing and sing I hear, I hear, I hear the magpie singing I hear, I hear, I hear the magpie sing I hear, I hear I hear the cat scratching I hear, I hear, I hear the cat scratch Little peck. Sleep time. The Marquise wants to extend your stay with Loulotte. I must show you the rest of the house. Get dressed. The kitchen. Madeleine! Meet Madeleine, our cook. Queen of sautéed potatoes... And flan! This is Becassine. Welcome, Becassine, enjoy my cuisine. Hello, Madeleine. If Madeleine bothers you, tell her. Her one flaw is she hates to be alone. She often abandons the stove. Pathetic little clown! You didn't want to know. That's no way to leave a fragile woman! A sensitive one! Miss Chestnut, our housekeeper. Meet Becassine. Becassine. Hello, Becassine. Hello, Miss Chestnut. What's "Becassine"? A flock of woodcocks flew over when I was born.. A flock of woodcocks? We've seen 3 nurses fly straight into the gutter. So watch out, Miss Becassine! And where does "Chestnut" come from? That's her real name. You'll learn quickly. Good day. I take laundry on Thursdays. The shower is down the hallway. And I'm Hilarion, butler. Grand Cross, Brotherhood of Valets. Medal of Honor for my work as a butler for twenty years with the Marquise. He acted in the Bloke troupe in Trebeurdun. - Really? - Yes. I used to be an actor. I even played big parts. Blokes Playing Leapfrog! Blokes Making Crepes! And Racine! And Corneille! And Sophocles! Don't forget you're on trial. Staff dinner is served at 7pm. Madam will set your wages later. - Yes, because... - Because? Because, as soon as I'm able to, I... I'll pay for my train ticket to Paris. Paris... of course. Magnificent. What a life! Well. - Can she touch? - No, please. Why? Only I touch Fast Lady. - Is that her name? - Yes. - She must zoom! - Yes. Up to 60. That's high. It's Seraphin! I'm sorry! Here! - No problem. Thanks... - I'm sorry. I hear the horse trotting There's a horse, in the path, I hear the horse trot And fart and fart I hear the fart farting... Can you feel what's touching you? The wind. I need to celerize the bottle. What? Celery? To clean the bottle in hot water. Hurry, Loulotte's crying. Madam is eating. I have no time. Serve the rabbit now. Her soft-boiled egg was hard. The potatoes are mush. What were you discussing with Cyprien? I can't spend 3 minutes with an egg! You mustn't mix everything up! She's hungry! She's very hungry. Very, very, hungry! Fine. Let me do it. A potato fell in and swelled up! I can mash it with a fork. A bottle of mashed potatoes? Pour in the milk. Blends are good. And the potatoes? Pacifier with rabbit is not a good idea. - A pacifier full of sauce! - A pacifier full of sauce! Don't get yourself into a stew! What's that potato in the bottle? We couldn't get it out. - Reminds me of you. - How so? Potato head! It's late. She should be asleep. A potato head who loves you. Yes. - Can I help you? - Yes. Look, I drew my idea. I want to make this. Let's see. AUTOMATIC NIGHT BOTTLE I don't get a thing. What's it for? It's for Loulotte, not me. If you help me, I crank up the car. Uncle! You scared me! The Quillouch girl said you were here. - So you stole her job? - Not true. The Marquise fired her. Beware of her. You're still around? I was hired by this angel. - She looks like a weasel! - Uncle! Go see your parents. They're worried. I have a lot of work. Afraid to say you're not in Paris? How's the blue tree? I water it every day. Great. Does he always look upset? It's a girl. Her name is Loulotte. I must go feed her. Goodbye, Uncle. Goodbye, Becasse. You scratched me. A magpie in the pear tree I hear the magpie sing. A magpie in the pear tree I hear it sing and sing. I hear, I hear I hear the magpie sing. It's gorgeous! And the same view at night. What a marvelous idea! Dick has to see it. Day... and night. Look! Yes! It's magical. Next, I'll show you a very impressive view AUTOMATIC NIGHT BOTTLE from the pyramid in Guancha... Becassine? You're going to Paris to look for work? Yes! Come, come closer. See how pretty this is. Look. By day... The big greenhouse! And the same view by night. All those tiny lights! And now something exceptional. The grand theater of the Comédie Française. By day... And by night! That enormous chandelier... - Becassine? - Yes? You've made enough now to buy a ticket to Paris. It's great. You finished your first month. We're happy with you. I'm happy with you too. And Loulotte. And now... Mexico! Why are you here? It's time for her bottle. It's totomatic. What do you mean, totomatic? She had her bottle. AUTOMATIC NIGHT BOTTLE Wow! You really threw me for a loop. Meaning? Nothing. It's an image, a metaphor. Hi, Marie! Hey. Loser! Back to work! Not tall for its age. It takes its time. It'll live a long life. It must get bored all alone. I'm sure it chats with everyone. Even with mushrooms. I lost Seraphin. Look around. There he is. Tell me we'll never lose touch. I swear, on the life of that tree, we'll never lose touch. And I swear on your life. Tonight, a spectacular international marionette show! Guignol and his friends are coming for your pleasure! Spectacular marionette show tonight! Where is the show? I don't know. I'm looking. Not far. Come to the chateau. Straight ahead on the right. Good idea, Becassine. - Are there people there? - Yes. We're full! In that case... See you at the chateau tonight! See you tonight! Goodbye, see you and thanks again. Goodbye. See you tonight. Please, Marquise, say yes! They're all quacks. Give them this, they want that. He'll pass the hat 3 times. Now that he's out front. He looks like a nice man. It's yes, Loulotte. Madam? Tell Madeleine her soft-boiled egg is hard again. I was so thrilled to dunk my asparagus. Indeed. You've gone mad. Go tell Madeleine now. The Marquise said we can have the show tonight. Excellent news. Let's set it up. Madam's egg was hard again. She's the hard one. I can't do 3 minutes exactly. Especially if you're not there. What's this? That's a cage for the show. You'll see tonight. Ever seen a marionette show? - No. - No? What's that? It's a balloon that flies. You'll see later. What's that? An idea. For what? An egg-ejector. Let's see. It's basic... very basic. But doable. Can you build it for me? In exchange for what? Flan? -There's no... -Nope. I'll explain. I had a monkey named Bubu, very high-strung. One day he came unglued. Tonight you'll replace Bubu. -What's your name? -Loulotte. I'll give you a signal, like this, before the show... and you'll turn the crank. And... Is all well, Mr. Puppeteer? Yes. Some trouble with a marionette. The plestacle! The plestacle! The plestacle! Yes! I'll go back in. Sit down. Hello, my friends! Thank you for joining us for a grand spectacle. So, I'm the gendarme. And now I must look for the bandit. Have you seen the bandit? You haven't seen him? Is there anyone here who can count to 3? Me! Well, in that case, we'll count 1, 2, 3 and you'll tell me if you see the bandit. One, two, three. It's you! There! Here he is! Wait! I'll slap you! He's pulling my hair! That hurts! Let go of me! You want a slap? I'm going to cudgel you! How stupid. How utterly stupid. Take this! Look closely. You'll see a pretty chandelier. Here it comes! Now we'll turn it on... - Here it is. - That's pretty. You are my prisoner. I'll throw a bag of farts at you! - And the show is over. - Well done. Well done. - That was lovely. - Well... It was. The plot is pretty thin. But you laughed! I saw. I laughed because it's stupid. Now if you don't mind, for the artistes, I'll pass around... Like I said. 10 cents, okay... 15 francs, many thanks! One tiny cent, that's all? Well. Marquise, sir... Not much, for a man so well-attired. A banknote. Don't even think of it! But I am... thinking of it. And you, miss. Thank you. - You too, miss. - Here, Loulotte. Thank you! Did you enjoy the show? Good. Enjoy the rest of your evening. A little more music? I'm hungry, Becassine. Come on! You're crazy! Yes, Madeleine? Excuse me, Marquise. Have Hilarion make up a room for Mr. Rastaquoueros. He'll stay a bit before going to Paris, where he has much to do. Now this is important so we can keep in touch. Please, have a telephone installed. You ask a lot! It's very expensive. Yes but, with the deals I propose, you must be reactive. Decide over the phone and immediately I'll invest in Paris. The speed. Especially... if we expand to the American market. You're here. Perfect timing. Let me show you something. Yes! Come and see. Get out. No, don't do that. Stop it. Don't touch. Come and see. So... First, I'll give you back your blueprint. I followed it to a T. And I finished your egg-ejector. Look here! Watch this. Careful. Nice try. It still needs some adjusting. But when it works, it'll be... How can I thank you, Becassine? I'd really like... Watch the road. Now shift into third. Wait! Step on the clutch first. Pull the stick towards you... Very good. Put it into gear and accelerate. There you go. Excellent! You're doing well. Very good! Piece of cake. Careful! There's no speed limit, but slow down. It's the car, not me. Watch out! -Where's the brake? -It's there! -Careful! -There... no, it's fine. Careful, Becassine! Careful! A Fichet 1905. Easy as pie. Go on, little Rasta. Let's stop on the 8. Go on, Granny, your turn. Let's try the 7. Ladies and gents, tonight, a little game. A lottery that's a bit unique. You buy a balloon which lets you make a wish by slipping a small coin into this envelope. Again? Or else, a banknote. The longer your balloon flies, the more chances your wish will come true. One franc for a balloon... Plus the money you put inside. I'll start. I want a wish too. You have no money. She'll make a drawing instead. Yes, sure. For you, kid, that'll do. I have no paper. AN EGG-EJECTOR Here, Loulotte. See the sea - You'd like a car? - Yes. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, miss. - You're welcome. Perfect! Ready... Let go! It'll go all the way to America? Or maybe to Paris. It looks like all your wishes will come true. Cyprien! Madam lent him the car to invest her money in Paris. A puppeteer! Now we're in trouble. If he's a puppeteer, I'm a jazz drummer. He cuts a fine figure. 257 LI5 GUINGOIS I'll tell Cyprien. Too bad, I'll get a ruler. Marquise? Anyone there? Yes. It's Becassine who's here. Where are you? In Guing... in Paris. This is Mr. Rastaquoueros. Can you put on the Marquise? It's urgent. How do I put the Marquise on? Go get her! I have a fabulous deal for her. I'll be right back, Mr. Rastaclacos. Marquise? Rastacoulos on the line! It's fabulous! Cyprien is a non-stop toucher-upper. It's a major flaw. Who wants a toucher-upper? I understand. Toucher-uppers are nit-pickers. And nit-pickers never stop nit-picking. I didn't get that. Tell him love doesn't have to be perfect. Just intense. Where's the Marquise? It's urgent. Out with Hilarion. Why? Who's out with Hilarion? The Marquise, dummy! Rastaeros said put her on. He's in Paris. A fabulous deal. Yeah, right. Puppeteer! We know his deals. If he's a puppeteer, I'm a ballerina. Really? You're a ballerina? No. He'll end up driving the Marquise to ruin. He's a rake. He gardens? Madame is already in debt and he keeps asking for money. She's seduced by his deals which are scams. Tell him she's out. There. All of it. Here. - Watch your finger. - Yes. Think of a sphere. The Versailles gardens are spherical. - Versailles? - Yes. That's it. I'm a driver-mechanic, not... Here comes the apostle. I bet he pawned Fast Lady. 100 francs for a tandem bike. 50 francs per passenger. Good deal. And... 4 free bike clips. I'll go put it away. Madam lost tons of money. We may all be fired. Loulotte may go to boarding school. Not boarding school! I'm shaking too much. You go... If word gets out you're broke, creditors will come knocking. I can get another loan. The bank will give us no more credit, literally and figuratively. We can get by a few months until I settle this in Paris. You mean the Guingois casino? In the meantime, we must rebuild trust. But whose trust? That of your neighbors, merchants, contractors, leasers, creditors... Why not sell another painting? - Good idea. - Not enough? What are you doing here? Put that down. Where's Madeleine? She's sobbing, Madam. Bad timing. In sum... I'll ask the question once again. The situation is serious. Very serious. How do we rebuild trust? Oh, yes! I've got it. With fireworks. What? As Zambo said, "The only way to attract money is to show it." Absurd. What an amazing idea. So? They're having a big party. - What? - What? A party? That's absurd! Not now! As if we could afford it! DRIVER'S MANUAL "Basic safety requires the driver, "before making a turn, to signal with his arm "to warn the car behind "of his change in direction." What's this story? I don't understand. The driver's manual. If ever your wish comes true. Are you leaving? Am I going to boarding school? No, honey, no boarding school. I love you so much. I'll never leave you. Mr. Rastaquoueros has a good idea to regain our prestige. Is it good to get our prestige regained? It would be great. Get ready. LAUGH LAUGH LOUDER LOUDER Sorry. MAKE CONVERSATIONS APPLAUD Well done. MORE AND MORE APPLAUDS I shouldn't say it, but it will be very high society. The Marquise is expecting the Duke of... Canoodle. And the Prince of Doohickey. Our bike ride? We're not ready. I'll let you work. It's all very pretty. What am I doing? Write a nice article. My new voice? Your reporters will have to stay at the gate. We cannot invite everyone. Perfect. Goodbye... Not bad... Your turn, my dear. Hilarion... we have 20 to do and you're touching up. No, sir, I'm searching. And... finding. It's going to be a big party, a huge party! Lots of high society folk! Honk! So many people! So many cars! Lots of automobiles! Will Lord Arditi will be there? The Marquise has bounced back. The Prince of Doohickey! Mr. and Mrs. Louis Blériot. To your success, Marquise. Allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Allgood from the Noprob Bank. What a pleasure! Champagne! There's enough for everyone. Let's drink up! Not too much, miss. To you, Your Lordship! What a party! What fun! The Marquise must be doing well. That's not what I hear. Something is askew. - Don't you? - Yes. I'll clear this up. -Love you, Loulotte. -Me too. Saving the basics. - Where are you going? - To store all this. Then to the States. - Where? - The States. New York. Because business. But I'll be back, I promise. All right... When? My God! We're in a fine mess. Bankruptcy! The fake party was a disaster. Everyone she owed money to came knocking. Mr. Proey-Minans couldn't help, despite his connections. The phone bill we received was enormous! They cut off the eclectricity. The Marquise had to dismiss everyone to pay her debts. And it's not over. Except me. Now I must do everything. Cleaning, serving... cooking. At least I still tend to Loulotte. That's all that matters. The Marquise was judged dissolvent. Insolvent. Disinvolvant to raise Loulotte. That means boarding school. I'm totally against it. How will I manage? And the puppeteer? Rastacarros? No news. He must be in Nude York by now. But he'll come back. If I find him, I'll stick a riffle up his ass. If he's a businessman, I'm a clarinetist. Really? You are? No, I'm not a clarinetist. He'll be back. He promised me. Bongenre Boarding School Marquise, Becassine... We'll see you next weekend. I'm just staying a week? Maybe a bit more, but... Let's not be childish! Yes, let's! Becassine! Don't you start up too. My little Loulotte. My little baby. I love you, poopsy. Stop this nonsense. Put her down. That's enough. Please, you know we have no choice. Loulotte... We don't live far. Not too far. And we'll come visit often. Her bag, please. Vive la France. Louise-Charlotte, be a big girl. Give me your doll. We'll put it away. You can have it at bedtime. Take that, Miss Bongenre! Becassine, you clumsy oaf! You think you can clown around with a pile of porcelain? Loulotte will think we forgot her. Stop crying like a child. Go to your room. I can't see you! "My Loulotte, my treasure. "Life here is hard without you. "I'm all alone with the Marquise and I miss you a lot. "I feel roached "and I drink a product to feel better "but it makes me even worse. "This evening, I had a very good idea. "As soon as my work allows me to, "and if Madam agrees, "I'll come to the boarding school and get a job there. "That way, we'll always be together. "Give Seraphin a kiss from me. "Yours, Becassine." Darn. I have no stamps. And no money to buy one. And no mailbox. I'll deliver it myself. Tomorrow. No, Becassine. Not tomorrow. Now. Tomorrow you work. You have chores to do. Hello, blue tree. BONGENRE BOARDING SCHOOL Stop sticking out your tongue. No swelling. Come on, Becassine, drink your porridge. Just a little, to make me happy. Yes. It's Uncle Corentin who took me down from the tree. He followed the line and that's how he found you. Go on, swallow... very good. Speaking of lines, as mayor, I have certain privileges. Watch this. Yes, good day, ma'am. I'm the mayor of Clocher-les-Becasses and I'd like to speak to Miss Loulotte, please. Louise-Charlotte. I'll get her. I'll hold the line. Louise-Charlotte, telephone! Yes? Loulotte! Becassine? My Loulotte! -Becassine! -My Loulotte Phone calls are expensive. Are you well? Do they take good care of you? I ate profiteroles. That's wonderful! We almost picnicked in the forest. We prepared the bags. That's good... but why "almost"? It was raining so we picnicked indoors. That's still good. Not as... We'll go to the forest together. When? What else do you do? We do math. Bravo, my little darling. I want us to be together. I know, honey. Me too, you know. What do I hear? It's Seraphin giving you a kiss. How is he? He's sick. He's vomiting. What is he vomiting? Cotton. I'm sure someone can fix him. Have you made friends? No, we get in fights. They're all mean because I have no Mommy or Daddy, just a fake Granny. But I said I have my friend Becassine. Time's up! So... Louise-Charlotte must go to class. Goodbye. Loulotte? Is anyone there? No one fixed Seraphin. Who is Seraphin? Her binkie. The Rasta Egg-Timer "Already 100,000 sold." This advertisement... It's my ejector! No way! Unbelievable! How wonderful! You drive me crazy, my wild beast. By accepting my hand, Hermine, we'll strengthen a situation that's fragile both emotionally and economically. Of course, Adalbert, but... my newfound solitude and austerity are doing me good. Look, Madam. The same as my invention. The Rasta timer? What is it? That Greek puppeteer again! "Great American invention." Good old Rastaquoueros! I have more inventions for him. Floors with springs, the totomatic night bottle... He stole your idea. "Already 100,000 sold." Making money off you after ruining you! Put it in an international context. There's a recession! He did what he could, with real passion for business. Your Mr. Passion disappeared without a trace! He promised me he'd be back. And he will. Never trust the words of a gentleman thief. A gentleman grief. You're not funny. You never are. No, you're here. Rastaquoueros! With Fast Lady! What a character! Come, Rastaquoueros, my gentle thief! My gentle relief! Sorry! I'm so overjoyed! It's your money, Becassine! Your wish in the balloon landed in New York, where a rich industrialist developed your egg-timer. The balloon landed in America? Loulotte's wish! Since my name was on the balloon, I asserted our rights. Thank you! You're fantastic! I'm so happy! I have presents for everyone. Here's your egg-ejector. For the Marquise, an album of Greek music! For me? For Loulotte, a mini "Fast Lady". -It's gorgeous! -Yes. Here, sweetie! -It's a $100 note. -Thank you -What is she doing? -No idea. Good old Becassine. I owe so much to her. Speaking of that, before paying her, I'd like to suggest a smart investment opportunity. No way, Greeko. Only risk-free investments now. We start saving and working. We'll repair the chateau, plant vines. What would you say to a trip to Greece? Yes, why not? Stop acting like children! They're exhausting. It's easier to play lousy than well! I came for Loulotte. I have a permission slip. You should have called. Louise-Charlotte is in bed, asleep. She lost a tooth. It hurt all night. Loulotte? Becassine! Becassine! My little Loulotte. My little pearl of love. A magpie in the pear tree I hear the magpie sing A magpie in the pear tree I hear it sing and sing. D 17, PARIS
