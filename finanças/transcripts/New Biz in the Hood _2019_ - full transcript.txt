Sorry, I have no more power. I see- What did he not do to me? I'll take him to me for a week I'll take him to the office, it's going to calm him down To La Courneuve? In his life he did not leave Paris Exactly, it will do him good You know, it changed me a lot well I don't know what to do Rest a bit Talk to you soon and keep up the good content If I may still call you that Thanks No problem We are together in parenting Here Hands. Take your hands out of your pockets How are you, Arthur? Good, and how are you? -Excellent Pay attention, all of you The one who does not know, this is Arthur My son will be with us for a week If you have something to photocopy, if you want coffee Someone to carry heavy things. Do not hesitate to ask him. Hello, Arthur! How did you grow up? Want to help me with the bills? Not really Do not argue, this is not a vacation. Go. Samy, can you transport the models to the factory? Cool! Can I go, too? -Sure Thanks, Fred! Hey, take it easy Bring the keys! -moment Bring the keys! cool This is a spaceship Hello, Jean-Yves How are you? Fred Bartel speaking Fred Bartel Yes, we did not speak for a long time I've heard your business is good To be honest, I'm calling about it I have a juicy deal And I'm looking for partners. I was wondering if maybe... Not much Two hundred thousand Hi, Stephanie, how are you? It's Fred Fred Bartel When did you go bankrupt? I'm also happy for lunch, of course But the truth is ... before December I can't I'm really busy Hello, Grandpa! It's Fred Good morning, can I have a pack of Marlboro Lite? Everything is good? Join us for coffee Sure Christina, one more coffee, please Are you okay? Not bad Cash flow problems, like everyone else Here, too Thanks There is one in the neighboring district that breaks our prices I do not know what they put in cannabis. Everyone goes to them From what I have seen, yours is actually good A bomb. -So what's our problem. -Do not know.. Maybe the price... or the marketing, the packaging The ancillary products, you understand Did you not understand? Show me your product Show me. -Show him Well, that's what I mean We're not in Poland. Look at this So what? - I want to cry Only it.. Look, wrap it up ... on some beautiful paper Like, neat It's a little more appealing, right? He is right. Now I want to buy Okay, but that's not all The most important is that people come. Buy your cannabis Not just cannabis! YOUR cannabis You need a brand, a name, a label Something impressive? What's your first name? My name? Bibiche. Why Bibichit, that's what it's called Bibishit! What? And now... You have a brand Smoke your cannabis and say "What an excellent cannabis" "Yes, it is!" Where can I get "Bibichit"? You'll sell piles That's smart Another thing. Customer loyalty When you buy a carton of cigarettes, you get a lighter This is how you do it. Buy cannabis for 50 euros, get a lighter Cannabis for 100 euros, get a T-shirt, hat, no matter what Customer Loyalty No way, just for that! Too bad I did not go to school This is my career ...excuse me Who's that? Do you like Barry White? -Love him I got married to this sound. "Let the music play" You know that with us, in the neighborhoods He's the boss. Like Michelle Sardo for you Michelle Sardo? What a cliche!

I was waiting for you. Follow me You are lucky Usually we do not find them And without a scratch. -What happened? The Cue What did they do? We stopped them in your car Driving around the Gagarin Towers Obviously. They work for me I gave them the vehicle as part of the job Why did you stop them, exactly? This is our job. -This is not your job. It's ridiculous! Pakistani and Arab in SUV Obviously they're thieves Not Pakistani, Indian Calm down, please. - I'm not worried Leave! I will not leave! -This is racism Okay, release them. -You are welcome And you, replace a thread When my employees did nothing! Especially when they're innocent. Go ahead, go Handcuffs? seriously? Thanks, Fred, you were great Why did you go to Gagarin? It's not on the way Samy wanted to change shoes. In honor of the customer My dad wants to talk to you How are you, Mr. Banaisa? What happened?

Light Hare Not just light, I would say Yes, it's delicious. - It is. This is your family, pictured? Yes, I have six children. - Six Yes, and everyone's married, Hamdulla Everyone except this brat I'm young. I've got time At your age, I already had three children You're just playing on the PlayStation! On the phone, on WhatsApp.. Seriously, I'm lucky I found him He's awesome!

My tongue is on fire Give your father bread No, you need oil Mother, the Olive oil. -Universal medicine, Mom Oil everywhere He told you about his girlfriend? He's in love Is he in love? - You did not tell them He's talking nonsense It's Leila They call her Elodie Elodie? Listen, when you put the product on display...

Two hundred thousand That's what you need, isn 't it? -Yes but.. I can not take 200 thousand in cash. No way This is not a gift.
