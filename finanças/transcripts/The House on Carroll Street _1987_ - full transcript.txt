This hearing will come to order. The witness will please state her full name. Emily Crane. - Where do you reside, Miss Crane? - New York City. Would you mind speaking into the microphone? Excuse me. New York City. - Where are you employed? - Assistant picture editor at Life magazine. Miss Crane, are you a member of the board of an organisation called Liberty Watch? - Yes. - Does your subpoena direct you to bring here all books, ledgers, records and papers - relating to that organisation? - Yes, it does. Did you bring them? - I have a statement... - Please answer the question. Your questions will be answered... We will consider your statement in due time, Miss Crane. "We are an organisation devoted to civil liberties..." - We know about your... Miss Crane. - "We make no political..." We know about your organisation. That is why you are here. - "We have no religious qualifications..." - Do you deny... Do you deny... Miss Crane! Do you deny the committee the materials requested in your subpoena? In our files are the names of people we've helped or who've helped us. - I won't be a part of getting them... - A great publication. Life magazine. You agree? Yes. A circulation of millions. Each week a picture view of worid events and you select those pictures. I'm impressed. - I don't decide what goes in the magazine. - But you can suggest. The witness' work at Life magazine is irrelevant. I fail to see how any of this relates. Do you recognise these petitions - the Stockholm peace petition, Worid Disarmament, Ban The Bomb? Your signature on all of them. You write a lovely hand. - These are your signatures? - None of this is relevant to the inquiry. You got others to sign them, didn't you? Did they know what they were signing? I never lied to anyone! How did you persuade them, a beautiful woman such as yourself? I object to this line of questioning! - These questions are hardly germane. - The witness is in a position to distort information received by millions of Americans. That's ridiculous! She's refused to surrender her files to this committee as ordered in her subpoena. Miss Crane, you know we have a legal right to those records. You want to smear people. Then you withhold materials requested in your subpoena. I will not give you their names. I believe a citation is called for. I don't want to do this, Miss Crane, but you don't leave us much choice. The law is very clear. You're sure you won't reconsider? I'm truly sorry. I move we cite this witness as being in contempt of Congress and take steps to bring this to the Senate floor. All in favour. Motion carried. This hearing is adjourned. Everybody, please... Senator Byington. - Get some shots of the family. Here she comes. They call this spring, I'm freezin' to death. It doesn't feel cold to me. Where you come from, 20 below is a heat wave. Where I come from, people aren't colder than the weather. It's a dry cold. It doesn't feel the same. So your nose drops off. I'm puttin' on the heat. That'll look suspicious - motor running, not moving. What are they gonna do, call the cops? These are for you. - Payday. - Thanks, Tommy. It's four times what I make, Warren. - Think of it as a bonus. - It's not a bonus, is it? You weren't supposed to get that before you were told. So tell me now. It wasn't my decisión. We're reorganising your department, cutting back. - You know how they get upstairs... - Warren. We've always been honest with each other. They can't afford to offend public opinion. They make public opinion. Why the hell couldn't you cooperate? Your goddamn testimony. What's the big deal? Don't you know the climate? You had a future here. Thanks for the truth. If you quote me, I'll deny it. Miss Crane, Special Agent Cochran, FBI. We'd like to talk to you, please. I have nothing to say. Legs are still holdin' up. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Could you tell me where this street is, please? It's same like this street. You know? Like this. - Parallel? - Yes, parallel. You go around corner. On the left, first street. Thank you. - Yes? - Good afternoon. - I've come about the ad. - You're too early. The ad said 3:00. Please? All right. Thank you. Well. At least you've got spunk, coming early. - You're not afraid of being turned away. - I need the job. Come along. Read this to me. "But there was no one there, "no one to see the slight, small girl just turned 19, "whose hair was blacker than the wing feathers of a rain crow, "and whose eyes, oddly, were the exact colour "of the evening sky come harvest time." That will be enough. I think you'll do. Your voice has a certain cultivation. - Have you been to college? - Yes. - Graduated? - Yes. - Cum laude. - My eyes have begun to fail. I require someone to read to me. Your hours will be decided by how I feel. - The salary will be $50 a week. - That's not very much. The door is right behind you. You will also be fed. "...l'll take nothing with me except a few clothes. "I'm leaving you everything, "even the child you've taught to hate me. "'Lynn doesn't... ' Court began, but the door flew open "and Lynn came into the room. 'Let her go, Daddy,' she cried, "'I do hate her. I do! I do!"' ... approximately two weeks. Under no circumstances does he go outside. Dr Teperson said it's too dangerous. He has been here long enough. - He wishes to know about his assistants. - Tell Dr Teperson they're coming. Rome wasn't built in a day. Tell him what I said. The assistants will be here. I guarantee it. There's a little problem getting them out. All fixed now. Very good? - You didn't tell me about this group. - A favour for important people. - I certified they were genuine refugees. - 100% genuine, from the old country. - What are they, rocket scientists? - There's none left. These are doctors. - What kind? - Research. That's all. What kind of research? Where? Rest assured. - These are only technicians. - Meaning? Test tubes, blood samples. Think I didn't make sure? - These men are clean. - Then why the secrecy? The false names? They're technicians in an area vital to national security. Simple as that. I've trusted you, Ray. Would I abuse that trust? This won't harm your reputation. We're not talking about my reputation. We're talking about a presidential hopeful the country's taken to its heart. You have a noble ambition, Senator. I'm helping you reach the pinnacle. This other thing is of small importance. But if these men are war criminals... They're not. I assure you of that. Hello. We met the other day. Remember? I asked you for an address. - Parallel. - Oh, yes. I found the house. Thank you. Do you live in the neighbourhood? I was looking for a job at that address when we met. - Reading. - You're a reader? Uh-huh. I read aloud. Not this book. This is for my own pleasure. May I see? Certainly. - "Dickinson." Dickinson? - Hmm. - Should I know about this Dickinson? - She's a wonderful poet. I'm named after her. - You're named after Dickinson? - No. My first name. Emily. Emily Crane. Do you know Mr Edgar Allan Poe? Uh-huh. I practise my English with his poems, for the sound. "To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells "From the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells." - I think that's very beautiful. - Yes, it's very beautiful. - Where did you learn to speak English? - Many places. - During the war? - During, after. Do you translate? Is that what you do? Why do you think that? I heard you translating, the other day. I couldn't help it. The window was open. The other man was yelling... - What man? - Dr Teperson. - He's a tall man... - You saw him. - I didn't mean... - Do you know German? - No, no. I... - Do you know this name, Teperson? No. Should I? Thank you for your Dickinson. - Do you translate for Mr Salwen? - I do not know... - But I saw you... - You're making a mistake. Excuse me, please. Goodbye. - I know nothing of her. - You talked long enough. We talked of poems. She's reader. What else did she say? Nothing. I've told you. Emily Crane? She's named after poet Dickinson. Hi, Ray. Here's the file you sent for. You're working on this one? Yep. Spot-checking. See if she'll talk. Routine. - Lean on her. - Why? She's nothing special. - Washington wants it. - Emily Crane. Maybe she's hooked into something bigger. - Like what? - Like go and find out. Good morning. Er... Ready to talk to us, Miss Crane? Miss Crane? Guess not. - You are late. - I'm sorry they bothered you. Not bother. They disturbed me. - I dislike being disturbed. - I should have told you... I have no interest in your troubles, Miss Crane. Would you like me to leave? You will be informed when I do. Please continue reading. Thank you. It's very nice of you to come. - Are you from the office? - No. He was such a lovely man. "...though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, "I fear no harm: For you are with me: "Your staff and rod comfort me. "Thou setest a table before me in the presence of my enemies." She's wrong, your Dickinson. She has poem - "heart asks pleasure first." You know it? - "And then excuse from pain." - Wrong. First comes pain. - Why you follow me? - I wasn't. I... Are you from the government? What you want? I don't know. Please? - When I saw you with Mr Salwen... - There was no Mr Salwen. - I can help you. - Why you think I need help? - I think that you're afraid. - Of what? Something. Someone. Thank you. Are you here illegally? Maybe I can help. You know nothing of me. Why should you help? You look like you expect everyone to hurt you. How can you help? I know a lawyer. If you need a place to stay, we'll find you one. Here's my name and number. Emily Crane, remember? There. Please call. Marilyn, do you have the name of that immigration lawyer? - Which one? - You remember, the nice one. - What do you need it for? - I just need some information. - You must mean Bill Robinson. - Right. - How are you? OK? - Yeah, fine. Thanks. Bye. Who is it? Federal Bureau of Investigation. - I have nothing to say. - We've got a search warrant. Your organisation failed to register under the Subversive Activities Control Act after appearing on the Subversive Activities list, giving us the right to search your residence for your membership records. - I'm calling my lawyer. - We're coming in. You resist, that's a felony. You want that? Mr Engels, please. When will he be back? Can he be reached? Will you please tell him that I called? Miss Crane. No, he has the number. As soon as possible, please. Thank you. Don't touch those. Aren't there enough counterfeiters to go around? Treasury department handles counterfeiters. That's not where it was. - Look, lady... - Crane. Miss Crane. Miss Crane, I don't get a kick out of this. Of course not. You just take orders, right? - You don't know how lucky you are. - To have you in my home? Who do you think protects you, Miss Crane? We didn't break down your door. We used a search warrant, not a gun. - We're not subhuman... - You finished? Yeah, I'm finished. Be seeing you, Miss Crane. - How long you been with the Bureau? - Since law school. Why? - One of those farm states? - Kansas. You know that. - They have good-lookin' giris out there? - Come on, Joe. She got me mad. That's all. - This is a job, Mike. Cigarette? - No. You don't get mad or personal. Even if you come from the sticks where everybody says hello. I don't like this city. - Alan? Hello... - Emily Crane? I tried to reach you, but... - Who is this? - You're Emily Crane who reads Dickinson? Yes. Oh! Yes. I thought you were somebody else. - You think still you can help me? - Yes, I could try. I would like meet again with you. OK. I don't think that we should meet here. Erm... I'll tell you what. Near Sheridan Square, there's a bookstore. You can't miss it. It's quite large and sells used books. - You're alone? - Of course. Are you all right? Bad things are happening in that house. I wish not to be part. - Shouldn't you go to the police? - No. Of no use. - You say you can help. - I've called my friend. He's expecting us. He's good man? You trust him? Absolutely. Come on. We'll catch a cab. OK, sonny, let's go. - May I help you? - US lmmigration. He's an illegal alien. - They're not lmmigration. - Take it easy. No one will hurt you. - Where are you taking him? - Downtown. - No. - Don't worry, I'll call the lawyer. - They're not lmmigration! - Calm down. - Help me. - I'll call from their office. Can't do that, Miss Crane. Regulations. How do you know my name? Run! I don't know. Check here. I'll go this way. This way! Hurry! Come on. Please take your seats. The performance will continue in two minutes. - I have information... - Excuse me. Those are our seats. Excuse me. Honey. Mind if I start off with an old gag that always gets a laugh? - Excuse us, but those are our seats. - My stomach can't take it. - Some other pearl? - I'm fit to pop! - How about one that's a scream? - Go right ahead. But don't you dare to shift your load and say you are pooped. Can I help you? Unless you see that I am sick already. Why do I have to pack this stuff around? - You can't come back here. - We just want to get out. - How do you get out? - Down there. No! You can't go up there! Come down here! That should just about do it. Have you seen the captain? We're going out to the hospital. Nothing. Nobody knows who he is, where he lived. No ID. Fingerprints, clothes... Zilch. Nothing. He didn't exist. I told you before. Go to that house. I sent someone. They never heard of the boy. They're lying. Look, Miss Crane, we ran a check on you. You're in a little trouble yourself. You want my advice? Don't look for more. - He was trying to get away. - Away from who? Who murdered him? A fact or two. - Talk to Ray Salwen. - Why? - I saw him with the boy. - You think you did. - I know I did. - It's just your say-so. Why should I lie? Everybody lies. Go back to that house. Talk to Salwen. In the back. OK, get the next witness. OK. - You can go. - You got permissión from the FBI? Don't crowd your luck. We could book you as a material witness. You know any of these names - Samuel Hürwitz, David Bistrong, Jesse Sackadorf? They mean anything to you? Kid had 'em in his pocket. Good night, Miss Crane. Stay out of trouble. Up here? You don't mind? I was in the neighbourhood. Normally I would have called first, but these are not normal times. I can close the door if you want to get out. No? OK. Tell me, do you like reading to that crazy old lady? It's a job beneath your capabilities. You're an intelligent young woman. You had a promising future. - What do you want? - I'd like to help you. Why? "Y"... is a crooked letter. My mother used to say that to me when I asked too many questions. Emily... Can I call you Emily? You don't mind? The question is what do you want? I'm concerned for your welfare. Like you were concerned for that boy's welfare. I sought you out, Emily. I didn't have to come here. You're not important enough to buy off. Then why try? Nobody wants another mistake. Do you know these gentlemen - Hürwitz, Sackadorf, Bistrong, Teperson? Don't stay too long in a hot tub, Emily. You could catch a cold. I disapprove of snooping, Miss Crane. I beg your pardon. You show an unseemly interest in that house. - I didn't mean to... - What one means is irrelevant. What matters is what one does. I believe that house is connected with something terrible. Does it concern you? No, not exactly... Then you have no reason to pry. I do not know who lives in that house, nor do I care. However, it seems apparent they are no longer in residence. The shades are now always pulled down. No windows are ever open, even though the days are mild. Garbage is not put out. The house is almost certainly empty. But how can you really tell? I should imagine a rock through a window would do the trick. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just like lying here. Don't move. All right. That's not where I need it. - He pulled a dirty trick. - I know. I teach dirty tricks. Why didn't you just shoot him? I don't have a gun. - What? - I don't have a gun. They're too heavy to wear. Oh, that's better. You put 'em on your belt right here, you end up walkin' around like this. What are you doing here, anyway? You bellyached to the cops about this house. I thought I'd take a look. - Sorry about the other day. - Hm? I didn't mean to get personal. I was personal, too. Yeah, but you're not sorry. Did you hear something? You OK? Well, to tell you the truth, I do feel a little shaky. I think I should go home. Blood sugar. It drops when you get scared. You need something to eat. No. No, really, I should just go home. I'll stay till you get upstairs. Come to the window and wave. You've got a great act, Cochran. - Good night. - Want to give me that book you lifted? - This is the one you took? - Yes. - Emily Dickinson. - That's it. Here. I'd like to talk to you, Miss Crane. I've been waiting for you to show up. Here. This is the book that I took. It was owned by somebody named Laura Moulton. She wrote her name and the date, 1851. It was published in 1904, so she couldn't have written it in 1851. What does it mean? I can't figure it out. You comin', lady? I know it has something to do with the murder. So find out. Do something useful. ... drops too low. Ball two Fine crowd on hand here today. Well over 6,000... Thanks. We're delighted to see the youngsters in the ballpark. It's a fast ball! 2 and 1 the count. - Ink's modern. - What? The ink. It's modern. Lab says it was written within the year. - Look at that. The Duke went 4 for 4. - What's so special about 1851? 3 balls, 1 strike. Here's the pitch... Poe died in 1849. I looked it up. Poe's the shortstop for the Tigers, right? - It's a fly ball to right centre... - What do you think? He'll win the batting title going away. - Who? - Duke Snider. No. He won't beat Stan "The Man" Musial. - ... 36 RBis... - Suppose it isn't the year? Suppose... Suppose it's the month, day and then year? 1-8-51. January 8, 1951. - It's been and gone. - Right. Look at the handwriting. It's not American. Americans put the month first. Europeans put the day. It could also mean August 1, 1951. - That's tomorrow. - Right. Maybe she's on to something. You're a dumb hick. Why else did they want us to lean on her? - You know why? - I know two things. The Dodgers will win and what I learned in the navy - keep your mouth shut, your bowels open and never volunteer. - There was a murder. - A police matter. She'd have been next if I hadn't been there. - Make a wager? - We're already betting on the Pennant. Batting crown. You got Musial. I'll take Snider. - You call me dumb? - Come on. Deal? You got a woman's name and a date. Tomorrow. The lady's birthday? A rendezvous somewhere? Love nest? A rendezvous, you don't put down the year. You know what year it is. So... Maybe it's not a woman. All right. Through here. These three here. How did you figure out it was a ship? I've got a smart partner. I checked the manifest. She's carrying furniture and refugees. The cargo was shaken down before it was loaded. - You did all that? - It was my day off. I had time. - You keep surprising me. - Sometimes I surprise myself. Maybe I was wrong about you. Any of 'em look familiar? Uh-uh. That woman - I know her. I saw her with the boy at the house. We've got to follow them. Wait! Wait! Wait! - No. - Why not? You see that guy? He's government. Whatever this is, it's official. - Come on. - Official? You're official, aren't you? You're government. Official just makes it worse. - Freda, I am right? - No. Erm... Cecilia Ostrovsky? No. Why don't you try again? I never forget a face. On the names, I'm not so hot. - Er... Stephanie? - Connie. Sure, that's who, Connie. You're a friend of Stephanie's. I remember you. You remember me? I am Boria. Right, yes, yes. Where you been, Connie? I haven't seen you around lately. - I moved. - Oh, sure. I don't blame you. - This lousy town is a dump. - Yes. - You want to dance with me, Connie? - No, thanks. Maybe later. I got to dance right now. Later, I ain't even going to be able to stand up. Oh! Well, look me up if you can make it, Boria. Wonderful party, isn't it? - I said, it's a wonderful party. - Oh, yes, very wonderful. How was your trip? Was it smooth? Yes, very smooth. Oh, I'm sorry, please forgive me. Connie Ostrovsky. Sackadorf. Sackadorf. Well, you must be Mr Bistrong. - Hürwitz. - Oh. And Dr Teperson. Have you seen him since you've arrived? I am Teperson. - Do I know you? - Miss Ostrovsky, Dr Teperson. - We have met before, yes? - Yes. Erm... Mrs - I can't remember her name. She introduced us. - I was thinking before today. - No, I don't think so. I certainly would have remembered. Will you gentlemen please excuse me? Pardon me. Cochran, let's dance. You see that tall man, the one with the men from the boat? He's the one I saw at the window. He's watching us. He recognised me but I don't think he knows from where. The boy had the names of those men in his pocket. He was getting them from the cemetery. They're dead people. They're being smuggled in as people who are dead. Why are they smuggled in? Who are they? - People who can't get in normally. - Why? Which side were they on? Come on, let's get out of here. - I've gotta find out. - No! Wait... Cochran. - Simpson. - You part of the wedding? Yeah, kind of. You here officially? This is hands-off for you people. You know that. Gentlemen, would you please pay attention for a moment? Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to use the Brooklyn house. You'll be spending the night here. You'll leave for Chicago tomorrow. You'll be leaving on the Chicago express, which departs at 6:00. Tell them there is nothing to worry about. In Chicago, it will be impossible to trace you. Hold it! Boria! You're still standing. Let's dance. You're out of your jurisdiction. I recommend the hamburger, no kidding. It happens to be famous. - No, thank you. - You like it medium-rare? - Nothing. Thank you. - "From nothing comes nothing." Shakespeare - King Lear. I have a head full of useless quotations. Medium. You like cottage fries? Cottage fries. Emily. Nobody wants to hurt you. I tried to make that plain before. There's been enough strong arm already. I'm offering you a bargain. 100% clearance, FBI off your case, no names, membership lists. Between us, we got that list a long time ago. All I want in return is the simple truth from you. Who else knows? That woman that you read to? Now, think before you speak. I'll make a deal with you. I'll tell you who knows if you'll tell me who killed the boy. Curiosity killed the cat, Emily. He was killed years ago. You don't survive a childhood like that - the camps, the wars. He arrived here dead. Unknown, unwanted, illegal. I took pity on him. - He worked for you? - Odd jobs. Like getting names off tombstones? Be careful that your reach does not exceed your grasp. Who killed him? Ketchup. Not blood. Everything's a joke to you, isn't it? Bringing in Nazis disguised as Jews, it's such a funny idea. Who else could think of it? Who has that kind of humour? Jew killers into Jews? Eat before it gets cold. You're an educated person, Emily. You should know the lessons of history. What does a map of the worid tell you? After the first war, one sixth of the worid. After the second, what? Half? The stain is spreading. You think the war is over. Worid War II, sure. Worid War III? Batter's up. I'd like to go home now. We haven't heard your part of the deal. Who killed the boy? You killed him, Emily. With the best of intentions, of course. You killed him with kindness. You're a do-gooder. Your hand goes out in charity. What's it matter, a boy falls by the wayside? Without you, he'd still be alive. No one else knows. Don't turn on the light! I'm in the kitchen. There's a man... They had it wired to the stove. It would have exploded if you boiled water. This is as far as I got with it. Shouldn't we leave? They usually blow up about a minute after being detached. It's been about 30 seconds. Do you want to start counting? One, two, three... four... five... six... I was never very good at bomb disposal. I almost flunked the course. ...nine... - It's kind of like a crossword puzzle. ...11... 12... I was never really good at those, either. ...13, 14... 15... 16... 17... 18... 19... 20... - Shit! - What's wrong? Nothing. Keep counting. - I cut the wrong wire. ...24... - Sorry about the language. - Don't give it a second thought. 25, 26, 27... - Cochran, let's get out of here. - I hate confessing to defeat. Let's go. No! No, come on! Go! 35, 36, 37... 38, 39... 40, 41... Ah! 42... - 43... - Right here. 44, 45, 46, 47... - Maybe I cut the right wire. - 48... He knew he was gonna kill me... while he was ordering me dinner. "The famous hamburger." He sat there and he made jokes. And he looked at me... and the whole time, he was only waiting till he knew it was time. What would they have said, Cochran? Gas leak? Smoking in bed? - It's OK, Emily. - No! Shh, shh, come on, come on. You're OK. It's the only place I could think of. Anyone I know? Do you know any bank robbers? No, not personally. It's just I didn't know where else you'd be safe. You sleep OK? Fine. Thank you. You make sounds when you sleep. I know. I squeak. No. You don't squeak. Erm... We're oil and water, Cochran. Not last night, we weren't. In the dark... all this disappeared. It's morning now. We can make it night again. Why couldn't we have met in Worid War II when we were on the same side? I hated New York till I met you. But all I've done is get you in trouble, you and everyone else. Well, lose a horse, lose a buggy. We try to stop them, don't we? They're leaving today at 6:00. - You can't. You've been warned off. - Just don't confuse me. Are you doing this for me? I don't know why I'm doing this. I do and I don't. All right, now I'm confused. I don't think you're that confused. You don't know me very well. I confuse easily. Ask anyone. You're tender, Cochran. That's what did it. Uh-uh. No. Hold it. Library. Wentworth speaking. Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Mike. - Yeah? Your boss wants you. Cochran, I've been looking for you. Come in. We've a few things to talk about. Merchant Limited to Boston, now loading for 5:15 departure. Available on track 15. - Agent Hackett. - May I speak to Cochran? No. He's in conference, Miss Crane. Tell him I'm at Grand Central. Our people might be on the train. Miss Crane, if... She called. She's at Grand Central. - Damn it! - What happened? - I'm off the case. - What else? I can't tell anybody what I know and I gotta stay away from her. Northwest Unlimited to St Louis on track 32, loading for a 5:45 departure. Stops at Poughkeepsie, Albany, Schenectady, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo... - How are you, Benny? - How about that haircut? - Next trip. - You said that last time. A manicure too. - You're too old for a manicure. - Not if you sit on my lap! All talk. He's not married any more. He's separated. Excuse me! May I help you, miss? I thought some friends might have boarded early. - Four men? - Yes. - Government people? - Are they here? Uh-huh. I just wanted to know if they were on board. Follow me. Is this the one? You can't play tricks on the Chicago Express. Why can't you stay in one place? Cochran, why do you keep on scaring me? Everybody else does. Why not me? Let's go. I lost her. She disappeared down one of the tunnels. I chased her down the tracks, then she walked into one of the side tunnels. I can't find her. You're a schmuck. I don't want to take a chance. We'll go up and around. They'll be on the train. Come on. Get out of here! The Chicago Express, train 25, now available for boarding. Nobody took me off the case. Hey, come back here! You know... none of this had to happen. None of it! What was such a necessity? Why couldn't you just stop? A boy from nowhere? I refuse to believe that. Why, Emily? Why do this to yourself? We could have lived and let live. It wasn't personal with me. Emily, didn't you know what you were doing? Those Nazis. Who cares any more? A footnote of history. Don't turn away. Emily. Emily. Emily! You are hurting your country. These men will serve America in her moment of need. Do you have the right to interfere? Look in your heart. Don't turn away, you stupid girl! Listen to me! Salwen! Get out of here. I'm givin' you a break. You have no right. Watch. You, you, you and you - - under arrest. - You're crazy. Keep your hands on the table. I want you safe for trial. These men are legitimate refugees. They have papers. Sackadorf, Bistrong, Hürwitz... - Exactly. ...and Teperson. Stay out of this. The real name over there is Gerhardt Kunst. In charge of experiments in how long a man can survive in ice-water before he freezes to death. Subject to experiments were prisoners in Auschwitz. - Should I do the others? - Fool. You think you've stopped anything? You know what they'll do to you? Maybe they'll give him a medal. Emily. - How are you feeling? - I'm all right. I'm OK. We had to wrap up the case. It took till this morning. I waited for you. I guess I could have called. I'm being transferred. Butte, Montana. That's too bad. I could have been canned. It could have been worse. I don't think much of the big city, so... I'll give you a call from Butte. That would be nice. Safer, anyway. You know... it really wouldn't have worked. Oil and water. Opposite sides. You're right. Take good care of yourself, Cochran. You, too. Miss Crane. I'd still like to talk to you. I have nothing to say. Subtitles by ECI
