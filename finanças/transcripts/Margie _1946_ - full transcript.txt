I had thought a home and ring and everything Margie, you've been my inspiration Days are never blue After all is said and done, there is really only one Oh, Margie, Margie, it's you! Can you imagine, Mother? It actually still works! Well, after all, you'd hardly call it an antique It's a wedding present, and a very lovely one, too No kidding! Gee, when I get married, I hope people don't give me a lot of old junk - All I want is a mink coat - Yes, dear, we'll make a note of that Golly, Mother! What's that? Just an old pair of bloomers I used to wear when I was about your age Gee, they're hideous! I mean...well, they're so bulky! When you wear a dress, how do you ever get them from showing? Well, sometimes it was quite a problem What was this old chain for, Mother? That was treasured possession of your great-grandmothers' Golly, Mother, what was this? It's was a boy I used to know. He became the champion flagpole sitter of Ohio. - The what? - Flagpole sitter - It was quite a craze in those days - But, what on earth for? I don't know, darling. Some college boys started it and pretty soon all over the country boys were sitting on flagpoles Trying to stay there longer than anyone else How perfectly idiotic! What's this? That was another craze. Eating live goldfish. I knew that boy, too Live goldfish, how perfectly ghastly! Didn't it make them sick? I imagine it must have. - Alright, now, Joyce. That's enough - Oh no, Mother! Let's look at the rest of it Darling, you know we only came up here to pick out your old cotton dress ... Yes, I know, but there's lots of time Oh, please, Mother Tell me all about the crazy and idiotic things you did when you were my age Oh, just a second, I want to change the record Rudy Vallee Was he pretty terrific in his day? Yes, indeed! He was the Frank Sinatra of the time Honestly? My time is your time Your time is my time We just seem to . . . Did the kids scream when he sang like they do for Frankie? No, darling. That's something that belongs exclusively to your generation Oh well, he probably didn't send the way Frankie does - You in any of these, Mother? - No, I took those. They're mostly of Central High. - Gee, it hasn't changed a great deal, has it? - Hardly at all I simply adore Central High. Did you like it when you went? Um huh Tell me about when you went to high school What would you like me to tell? Oh, some simply terrific event that happened in your life Well, I'm not so sure a terrific event of those days will seem so terrific to you in 1946 There's no time like our time . . . And no one like you Your time is my time We just seem to synchronize and sympathize we're harmonizing... One steps and two steps Old steps and new steps There's no time like our time And no one like you! Come on, Vi! Hurry up, I'm waiting! Hi, Marybelle. Have you seen the new French teacher? - Oh boy, I'll say I have! Isn't he something? - Well, I only got a glimpse of him but I went straight to the office to see if I couldn't drop biology and take French instead You and a million others. All the girls have been storming the office all day. - Come on, let's go. - Just a minute, Charlie. Do you want a ride home with us, Marybelle? Charlie's got the car - No thanks, I'm waiting for someone. - Okay, goodbye! Honestly, that Johnikins is the most unpunctual boy! Did you see what she did? She put rouge on her knee. - Isn't that awful? - Uh huh! Marybelle is so stuck up. Thinks she's so cute. She is cute! I mean, if you like that type - Hi, Johnny - Hello, Red Hi beautiful! Am I late? Johnikins, you're terrible! If you keep me waiting like this again, I just won't let you take me home, that's all Ah, banana oil! Come on, let's go! Oh, uh, just a second, Johnnykins... I promised to pickup Margie Ah, gee wiz! Do we always have to drag Margie MacDuff along? Well, I can't help it. Her grandmother practically makes me. After all, she does live next door to me Well, she doesn't live next door to me. Far as I'm concerned, she's a pain in the neck! Shh! There she is. Hi, Margie! - Come on! - Hi, Johnny Well, gee, come on, MacDuff! Don't just stand there like a bump non the log! Okay, Margie, let's go! Hey, psst, Marybelle? Come here a minute What's the matter? Come here! Just a minute, Johnikins So long, Margie! What's the matter? - Do you have a safety pin? - A safety pin? Good night, Margie and Marybelle! What do you want a safety pin for? The elastic in my bloomers just broke I felt it Gee wiz, what are you two girls gabbing about? - Take him away! Take him away! - Do you want us to wait for you? No, just go on home - Why don't you go into the ladies room? - I'm going to And if you dare tell Johnny Green what's the matter . . . - I'll kill you! - I won't Well? Oh, alright, Johnny I'll tell your grandmother what happened - Margie decided to wait for something - What's she waiting for, the fall? Oh, Johnikins, you're a scream! You don't know how funny that is! Hello, Johnny! Hello, Marybelle! Hey, Margie! Here I am! - Hi, Marge - Hello, Roy I'm so glad you waited How come you didn't go home with Marybelle? What's the matter, Marge? Anything wrong? Margie, aren't you going home? - No, I've got some things to do - Okay, I'll come with you Why do you walk so funny? Anything wrong, Margie? Anything I can do? Yeah, go home and don't bother me! Call me up tonight, Roy Oh, hello Margie! - Miss Palmer - Come here, dear I got those books for you - Books? - Yes dear, for next week's debate Oh yes, the debate - I'm doing some more research - Very well, dear - Miss Palmer! - Oh, hello... Ralph - So this is where you hang out - Every other day from 3 to 5 - But how was your first day? - Standing room only! I never heard of a high school with such a passion to acquire French! Mostly girls I imagine Yes, I think they're in the majority Your ears should be burned to a crisp. You've been the one topic of conversation all day All the girls think you're just too darling for words Ah, come on. Cut it out, Isabel Well, it's quite a nice library you have here! Do I need a card? Oh no, my dear. We trust the faculty! What is it, Alice? - Hello - Hello - Do you like poetry, too? - Poetry? - Yes, isn't there poetry on your side? - Huh uh, political philosophy Oh, I see Hello Hello You're in one of my French classes, I believe - Yes, sir! - I was looking for Keats. Do you like Keats? I don't know, sir. What are Keats? No, no, no! Keats, the poet. K-E-A-T-S Yes, sir, I adore Keats Oh, hello! Do you two know each other? Margie, this is Mr. Fontayne, the new French teacher Margie is our champion debater, Mr. Fontayne. We're very proud of her. Why, just image, she's the youngest student in her class. Well, that's remarkable. I'll remember that. And make a point of attending the next debate Why, what's the matter, dear? Why are you frowning? Why did you have to go and tell him that I'm a debater and younger than other people? When a person meets another person for the first time . . . She doesn't want to be known as a debater and younger than other people! Oh, but I'm sure he'll appreciate you being so smart Don't you think he's cute? I don't know! I don't generally notice how our teachers look - Good night, Miss Palmer - Oh, good night, Margie - Good night - Good night, Mr. Fontayne Do you live far from school? Oh, about ten blocks Of course, I generally . . . Oh, good night, Susan . . . Mary . . . have several boys waiting to walk home with me, but today I was late tonight I'm quite sure you will never lack for escorts, Margie - Thank you, Mr. Fontayne - You're welcome Hi ya, Margie. I figured you'd come if I waited long enough Well, hello Roy! You didn't have to wait for me Have you met Mr. Fontayne? This is Roy Hornsdale. He writes poetry. - Hello, Roy. - Hello, sure we met. Come on, Margie! See you tomorrow What did he want? He merely happened to be in the library and escorted me to the door - I don't trust Frenchmen - He isn't French - Then why does he teach it? - Oh, Roy, don't be so juvenile! Marybelle! Yes, Mrs. McSweeney? - Have you seen Margie? - Not since I left school - She didn't come home with you? - Uh uh Well, where is she? What happened? Just a minute Well, it's her own fault! Oh, you know each other, don't you? This is Margie's grandmother, Mrs. McSweeney and this is Johnny Green Hi Young man, haven't you any manners? Your parents would be doing you a greater service If they taught you to stand up when you're introduced to an old lady! Take your hat off! And if you didn't use so much lip goo, maybe you could manage to kiss a boy Without getting it all over his face - Boy, is she always like that? - Look at your face! Mother says she's the most outspoken woman she's ever met Gosh! I'm certainly glad she's not my grandmother I know, poor Margie... Oh, golly! - That's awful! - What's awful? I forgot today was Wednesday That was my father. I missed seeing him. You know, Margie, I've been to your house several times and I haven't met your father Well, you see, he doesn't live with us Why doesn't he? I mean, are your folks divorced? My mother died when I was a baby. I live with my grandmother. Oh, but it's not Papa's fault. I mean . . . What does a man know about girls? Papa's a very wonderful man, but he's pretty busy He has a terrific business Of course, he pays for everything, but . . . Well, I mean . . . - Papa's a widower - Yeah, he would be! I mean, if your mother . . . Yeah, of course, I see Look! Boy, some car! Isn't it a peach? It belongs to Johnikins We girls all call him Johnikins - Johnnykins, of all the dumb nicknames. - It is not dumb! He's got a crush on Marybelle They got pulled out today in English Lit for holding hands Just a drugstore cowboy, if you ask me I'll see you tonight - Hello, Johnny - Hi, McDuff I thought, "We girls all called him Johnnykins"? A person only uses a person's nickname when she's alone with a person - Hi, Marge! - Hi, Marybelle I think Marybelle peroxides her hair and she uses too much makeup Marybelle Tenor happens to be one of my very best friends You'd never know it! Alright, Grandma! I'll be in in a minute Well, thanks a lot, Roy, for walking home with me. I guess you'd better be going now. - Goodbye! - I'm in no hurry Oh, well, would you care to come in and say hello to my grandmother? - Sure, why not? - Okay, wait a sec - Really, Margie! Do you realize . . . - I know, Grandma - But I couldn't help it. You see, I was walking . . . - Yes, I know Why don't you ever bother to repair the elastic in your bloomers? Please! Come on in, Roy - Look, Grandma, it's Roy Hornsdale - Hello, Mrs. McSweeney Mr. Hornsdale has been kind enough to escort me home fom school Well, how nice! Come in, Roy, come in. Sit down by the fire. Let me take your books. - Thanks, Mrs. McSweeney - Why don't you take off your overcoat? So, if Margie doesn't get to ride home with Marybelle and that Johnny Green . . . She nearly always has to walk home alone You know, Mrs. McSweeney, I've always wanted ask you . . . Why do you keep this old lock and chain hanging up here? - Young man, how old are you? - 17, going on 18 When you were still a gleam in your father's eye I lashed myself to the railing of the White House with that very chain And, it took four cops to chop through it with a hacksaw - I spent two days in jail - Gee wiz! What for? For a very noble cause Oh, really, Grandma. Why, I don't think Mr. Hornsdale is very interested in politics. Then, it's high time he took an interest I was campaigning for the right of women to vote They called us Suffragettes in those days Oh, yeah, I read about that My father says a woman's place is in the home You tell your father to wake up. This is no longer the dark ages! A woman's place is wherever she makes it Now, I've raised Margie to take a deep interest in politics Someday I hope some that . . . Someday I hope that Margie will be the first woman President of the United States! Gosh! It's not so foolish as you seem to think, young man A woman president couldn't be any worse than some of the men we've had in the White House Now, you take for example . . . Please, Grandma, we mustn't keep Mr. Hornsdale any longer Why, he's frightfully late as it is - Well, goodbye! Come and see us again - Bye, Mrs. McSweeney I'm sorry you have to go. Grandma! I don't want to be the first woman president of the United States. Do you hear me? Why, I wouldn't be the first woman president of the United State if you paid me And I wish you wouldn't keep telling that to people What's wrong, honey? First, Ms. Palmer tells people that I'm a debater And younger than other people And then, you have to go and tell Roy that you were chained to the White House, and sent to jail And then, about me being the first woman president He'll probably never come back! Oh, fiddlesticks! I bet a cookie he'll phone right after dinner - You think so? - I am sure of it. - Grandma? - Huh? Do you think Roy's Adam's Apple is very noticeable? Why, no, dear Oh, you're just trying to be nice You can't help notice it, I guess. It hits you right in the eye. Beggars can't be choosers I guess Roy is better than nobody Well, you wouldn't want a silly, vain, conceited boy like Johnny Green as a beau, would you? Yes!, Yes I would! A cup of coffee, a sandwich and you A cozy corner, a table for two A chance to whisper, and cuddle and coo With lots of huggin' and kissin' in view I don't need music, lobster or wine Whenever your eyes look into mine The things I long for are simple and few A cup of coffee, a sandwich and you A cup of coffee, a sandwich and you A cozy corner, a table for two A chance to whisper, and cuddle and coo ...and kissin' in view I don't need music, lobster or wine Whenever your eyes look into mine The things I long for are simple and few A cup of coffee, a sandwich and you Johnikins, stop! Miss Margie, have you done gone crazy? Oh, hello, Cynthia - Why do you wave your arms around like that for? - I'm rehearsing my speech for the debate You wasn't debatin', you was shadow boxin' Don't be silly, Cynthia Of course, I know my speech by heart. I'm merely practicing my gestures. You trip over that gesture and spill ink all over this carpet . . . And your old grandmother will flail you alive We got a new French teacher at school today. His name is Mr. Fontayne. Oh. he's frightfully handsome! Do you know anything about Frenchmen? All I know is they eat frog legs and snails I don't believe that! At least, I'm sure Mr. Fontayne doesn't - Every girl in school has got a crush on him already - Including you, Miss Margie I've got more sense than to get a crush on a teacher Fat chance I'd have anyway Cynthia? Do you think a woman could learn to love a man with an Adam's Apple? A friend of mine's husband's got a gouiter and she's got six kids Don't seem to trouble her none Psst! Miss Margie! They the kissin'ist couple! How can people waste their time like that? Why, I think it's disgusting! Goodnight, Miss Margie Goodnight, Cynthia Still I feel the thrill of your charm Lips that once were mine Tender eyes that shine They will light My way, tonight I'll see you in my dreams Lips that once were mine Tender eyes that shine They will light my way tonight I'll see you in my dreams Oh boy, was I lucky! I got the last plate of frankfurters What's the matter with you, Margie? Gone into a coma? Hello Isn't that disgusting! If I was him, I wouldn't make a public exhibition of myself If you were he, you would have something to be proud of - Are you the captain of the football team? - Can he write poetry? I don't know what you see in him? Margie, that theme you turned in . . . Don't get up . . . It's excellent, the best yet Golly, I mean, thank you You're quite welcome. Oh, by the way, when is that debate? - Wednesday, Mr. Fontayne. - I'll be there Hello, Mr. Fontayne - Wouldn't that curl your hair! - What's the matter? What's Margie MacDuff got that I haven't got? He never stops to talk to me Gee wiz! Are you still mooning over a French teacher? You're wasting your time. He's got a yen for Miss Palmer . . . Just watch You know, Ralph, I can always tell when you come into the cafeteria without even turning around - Yeah, how? - By the flutter of all the little girls' hearts Well, I don't see what he sees in her. She's old! She must be 25, at least You know, Isabel, there are times when I regret that I took your suggestion to join the faculty here Oh, get along with you. You know you love it. "Oh, Mr. Fontayne. What's the French for I adore you?" - How would you like a good punch in the nose? - I would much prefer a glass of milk. Oh, sure - I don't get it - Don't get what? - What are you looking up? - Crush! - What? - The French for "crush" You know You slay me, Margie! I never thought you'd be so sophomoric as to fall for a teacher Don't be so childish. Who's falling? He merely happens to be an excellent teacher But, gee wiz, Margie . . . Don't create a scene! - Can I get you something? - No, thank you! Oh, I'm so sorry! - It's my fault - Oh, no, no. It was my fault Here, look at your pretty dress! Let me . . . Now, why couldn't that have happened to me? Okay, Roy! I'll be down in a sec! Look, my father let me use the car today Oh, that's wonderful! Here it is, honey - You'd better take a spare handkerchief, Margie. - I won't need one No, but Roy will. That boy always has the sniffles - Gosh, I almost forgot! - Forgot what? My ice skates. We're going skating after the debate - You're coming, aren't you, Grandma? - I wouldn't miss it for anything! Grandma? Do you suppose . . . ? What is it, Margie? I was just wondering . . . Never mind. It doesn't matter. Alright, Roy! I'll be out in a minute! What were you just wondering about, honey? I just wondered if . . . If maybe Papa would like to come and hear me debate? I mean, it is Wednesday, anyway, and it would only mean a few hours earlier Because he always does come here on Wednesdays and . . . And he's never heard me debate I think that's a splendid idea, Margie Your father should hear you Why don't you ask him? You ask him, Grandma . . . Please! - Come on, call him up! - No, no! I'll do nothing of the sort You stop by his office and ask him yourself Since Roy brought his car, you've plenty of time No, I don't want to stop in his office . . . - Now, now, now, rubbish! You do as I say! - Alright, I will Bye, Grandma Goodbye, dear - Will it be long? - Huh uh Should I go with you? I'd like to see your father. I haven't met him yet Uh, huh uh! No! You'd better just wait here I won't be a minute Margie! Is your father an undertaker? Mortician! Good morning Hello Can I be of service to you? I'm . . . I'm Margie MacDuff. Could I speak to my father for a minute? - Isn't he in? - No, I'm afraid not You see, he's on . . . on a call I wondered if you could you give him a message from me? Of course, I'd be delighted Are you really the daughter of Angus MacDuff? Why, surely. Why not? Hasn't he ever mentioned me? Well, you see, I've only been employed here for a short time And to be very frank with you, I didn't even know Mr. MacDuff was married Why, of course, he was married! Otherwise, how could I be here? No, I wasn't questioning the fact, Miss MacDuff. I just wasn't aware of it Now, what message would you like me to give to your father? Well . . . Would you tell him that it's the debate today, and that it's . . . "Should we take the Marines out of Nicaragua" And that it's at 4 o'clock in the auditorium And, would he like to come and hear me debate, because he never has? I'm very sorry he wasn't in And I really have to fly now, because I don't want to be late for school I didn't know your father was an under . . . . . . that your father had his business on Ridge Street? That's not what you were going to say Well, no. I'm sure it's a very interesting business I bet it's a good business, too. I mean . . . Gee wiz! People are always dying! He can't help being in the business he's in It's alright I don't mind, honest Yes, you do! Everybody minds! I mind! I'd give anything on earth if he was just a plumber, or something Is he coming to hear you debate? I don't know I went in to ask him, but . . . He was out on a call And our next speaker is Arnold Harrison, captain of the Polytech team Mr. Chairman Honorable judges Worthy opponents Ladies and gentlemen My worthy opposition, the Central High orators, Have spoken to you of the high cost Of keeping the Marines in Nicaragua The cost! Yes, I said the cost! Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that my opponents . . . Have been like Rip Van Winkle . . . asleep for 20 years Don't they know that America has at last abolished poverty? That the cost is immaterial? Don't they know that prosperity is here to stay Ladies and gentlemen, this is 1928 Yes, 1928! This country is rolling in money The cost of keeping the Marines in Nicaragua . . . Is a mere bagatelle, a few million dollars And this the richest country in the world Oh boy! I couldn't take that anymore! That's cruelty to animals Come on. jitterbug There's someone in the corridor! Pardon me, is there a debate going on here? - And how! Right in there. - Thank you, thank you - Do you know who that was? - No. Mr. MacDuff! Margie's father He's an undertaker Poor Margie. A lunatic for a grandmother and an undertaker for a father Oh, Johnikins! My worthy opponents Where have you been last five years? Look, why don't we go inside, get our things, and go skating now, huh? What's the use. The band won't be there until six. Have to wait for the others, anyhow It's the faculty! - Wonder what they talk about in those meetings? - Boy, I'd hate to tell you - Got your car here, Ralph? - Uh huh - Can you drive me home? - I promised to hear the rest of that debate High school debates are pretty dull I don't know, I hear we've got some pretty good speakers After all, you know I'm a member of the faculty Also, you're a glutton for punishment - See you later? - Maybe. What's that, a new kind of necking? Hello, Mr. Fontayne Is the debate over? No, Mr. Fontayne. It's like Old Man River . . . It just keeps rolling along Do you see the notice from the principal's office saying students are expected to attend debates? Well, it didn't say positively Well, I'll make it positively for you Come on, beautiful. It's not my idea! And I say to you Leave the Marines in Nicaragua! Oh, Mr. Fontayne She'll be so happy that you came to hear her debate You know, she's got a school girl crush on you And now for the Central High team, Marjorie MacDuff Mr. Chairman Honorable judges Worthy opponents Ladies and gentlemen The arguments advanced by our opponents of Polytechnic High Are based upon a familiar but rather ignoble symbol The dollar sign! They have argued that we should keep the Marines in Nicaragua Because American occupation of that republic below of the Rio Grande Will raise the standard of living of the Nicaraguans And enable them to buy American plumbing Ladies and gentlemen Would you turn in liberty for a bathtub? Would you? This country of ours, our wonderful United States of America Was founded by men who traded their property Their very lives, all they had For the priceless gift of freedom All that our opponents can talk about It how much money the United States has Well, I don't care how much money we have Maybe we are the richest country in the world But I don't think that means so much Unless we share the freedom we have, and bring it to other people Where is the conscience, the heart of America? Where is the conscience, the heart of America? If we can say, "Give us Liberty or give us Death" Then we have no right to tell the people of Nicaragua That they should take bathtubs instead of freedom Ladies and gentlemen, I say to you . . . Take the Marines out of Nicaragua! We Americans fought in '76, in 1860, and in 1918 To make the world safe for democracy And we'd do it again, and again, and again, if we had to Don't let us ever forget our brave past Don't let the flag of the United States mean bathtubs and plumbing Instead of liberty to the people of South America! I say to you, take the Marines out of Nicaragua And bring them home to defend liberty always But never plumbing! He came! My father came! Your daughter is almost as good a skater as she is a debater, Mr. MacDuff Hi, Margie Why don't you turn his loose and let him break his neck?! Go away! Go away! Don't you pay any attention to him, Roy! You're doing beautifully - Isn't it fun? - Not for me! You know, Margie would look awfully nice in a skating outfit like Marybelle Tenor's You approve of a young girl exposing her bare legs? Sure! In my day, Mr. Fontayne, they didn't admit such young men as you to the faculty Always keep in mind, Mrs. Mc Sweeney, that I studied in Paris, France Angus, what are you mumbling about? She's right. She's right. The child is right! What? What child? My child, Margie! We should take the Marines out of Nicaragua. It never occured to me before - But, she's absolutely right - A convert Yes, I'm going to write to my congressman about it. I might even send a telegram to my senator Why did we send the Marines in the first place? Tell me that! I didn't send them there, Mr. MacDuff Don't they skate divinely? - A couple of show-offs - They are not! They're the best skaters by far, and they know people like to watch Come on, let's go! Let's sit down a second, my skate is loose I'll fix it for you You know, Margie, that was a pretty good speech you made Thank you Sure While you were speaking, you looked . . . Well, you looked sort of intense and full of fire You made me think in this poem "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" - That's you, Margie - Gosh! - Anything wrong? - Oh no, Roy is just tightening my skate. - With poetry? - Excuse me, Johnikins, I'll be back in a minute Oh, isn't the ice simply wonderful today? - It's getting a little rough, I think - Oh, I think it's wonderful! Well don't stand there like a bump on a log! Can't you see she wants to skate with you? Oh, don't be silly, Roy. He doesn't want to skate with me. Oh, it's okay. Come on, I don't mind The girl is right! Frank imperialism, that's what it is!! Why don't we let the Nicaraguans mind their own business? Oh, never mind that now, Angus. Sit down! Look! Margie is waving to you! Hi, Margie It's three o'clock in the morning We've danced the whole night through And then like soon will be morning Just one more waltz with you That melody's so entrapping Seems to be made for us two I could keep right on dancing forever here with you Wha's the matter, MacDuff? - What's the matter? You sick? - No, go away! Well, if you don't feel so good, hang on to me I wonder what she's trying to do? Margie, you're losing something Something's happened to Margie! I think she sprained her ankle - Are you alright, Margie? Are you alright? - Yes, she's alright, Angus. Stop worrying! Where do you hurt, honey? - I wish all the people would go away - Of course! Clear out of here, everybody! This isn't a free show. Give the child some air! - Grandma, my ankle hurts - I'll get a doctor - There's no need, Angus. She'll be alright. - What about that ankle? It's alright, Mr. MacDuff. I can fix that. Margie, stop fidgetting. What are you looking for? - Grandma, my bloomers are gone. - What? - Roy, have you got . . . - Grandma! Please! Now, Margie . . . When you get home, I want you to soak that in some hot water and Epsom Salts. Don't put any weight on it Mr. Fontayne, do you teach French or first aid? - I'm going to drive you home, honey - Thank you, Papa Thank you very much sir. You've been very helpful, very helpful. You know, I can't figure out what happened to her. She was skating beautifully. - I guess she must have lost her equalibrium - Yes, and her best embroidered ones, too Come on Why don't you sit down, Papa, and make yourself comfortable? Yes, Angus, sit down. You had a very large dinner and you should digest it It was excellent dinner, Grandma, especially the pie I baked it That's why I had two helpings Three, to be exact As the old saying goes, I hate to eat and run, but business first Business first - We're glad you could stay for dinner, Angus - So am I, Grandma, so am I And, Angus, we want you to come and see us more often Thank you, Grandma, I will. I will. You're absolutely right. We should take the Marines out of Nicaragua - Goodnight, Angus - Goodnight, Grandma Grandma, Papa kissed me! - Good evening, Mr. MacDuff. How's Margie's ankle? - Much better, thank you. Much better. Gee, he must have lots of money. That's a gorgeous car! I bet he uses it in the funerals Come on, Johnny. Let's go back into the house. What for? Your parents are hogging the living room Mother had one of her headaches coming on. Maybe it'll get worse and they'll go to bed. So many wonderful things have happened today At your age, Margie, wonderful things happen every day Call losing your best bloomers wonderful? Golly, no! That was awful! But just before it happened, I got to skate with Johnny Green That boy hasn't got an ounze of brains I wonder what did happen to your bloomers? Couldn't have just walked away Grandma, please! Let's not talk about it. - I'll never be able to face anyone again - Oh, stop . . . I wonder who on earth that could be Couldn't be Roy. He wanted to come, but I was afraid he'd see me and I didn't want him to Good evening. Can I speak to Miss Marjorie MacDuff, please? It's Mr. Fontayne! - Well, what if it is? Don't be so nervous. - I bet he saw. Oh, fiddlesticks! - Good evening, Mr. Fontayne. How very nice of you. - Good evening, Mrs. McSweeney, I... - Take off your coat - Thank you I happened to be taking a walk in this neighborhood. I often take a walk after dinner . . . And it occured to me to drop in and see how the invalid is getting along Well, she's doing fine. Come on in. - Well, has he doctor been here? - No, Grandma fixed it. - Sit down - Thank you - It doesn't hurt much anymore - Are you sure? Oh, yes See? I can step on it. Well, that's fine Mr. Fontayne, what does "La Belle Dame Sans Merci" mean? Well, that's the title of a poem by Keats Yes, I know, but . . . what does it mean in English? Well, roughly translated it means "The Beautiful Lady Without Pity" If someone said that to you, would you take it as a compliment? There's no question about it Margie! If your foot really doen't hurt,why don't you go up to your room and get Mr. Fontayne's muffler? - Yes, Grandma - That's probably the real reason why he came Oh, Margie? Just a minute I have something for you I believe you lost your handkerchief Thank you, Mr. Fontayne. That was very tactfull of you. Remember, Mrs. McSweeney. I studied in Paris, France. Hey, Margie? - What did Mr. Fontayne want? - He just came to call on me, that's all Well, aren't you excited? I mean, gosh, Mr. Fontayne! Did you know he was coming? Oh, naturally! People don't let people call on people unless they have permission. Did he bring you anything? I mean, candy or flowers? He has brought me a lovely gift What? When a person receives an intimate gift from a gentleman friend . . . She doesn't go around blabbing what it is How do you mean intimate? What did he bring you? Never mind. You never show me what Johnikins brings you Margie, do you suppose he's going to invite you to the Prom? I really don't know what his motives are Look, Marybelle, I really gotta fly. Men hate to be kept waiting, you know. Goodbye Yes, I'm . . . Wait... You understand, don't you, Margie? Yes, I understand Goodbye, Roy Well, it's all off Roy has a temperature Roy was my only hope Oh, it doesn't matter anyway I'd just as soon stay home Margie, would you like me to call Marybelle's mother? What for? Well, honey, Marybelle's going to the Prom with Johnny And I'm sure they will be glad to take you along Without an escort? I'd rather die! Why, I don't think that matters so much - Marybelle would understand - Well, I'll bet Johnny wouldn't He doesn't like me tagging along even to come home from school Here she comes now Now, if only she'd catch a cold. It's a wonder she doesn't Matby we could get Johnny to take you to the Prom A lot of good that would do. I know fives girls he'd ask before me What do I mean five? I can think of at least ten! Margie, twenty years from now, you'll look at Johnny Green And you'll wonder what you ever saw in him Twenty years from now, I'll be an old woman and it won't matter what I think That girl is coming over here to gloat over you. - Don't you tell her that you haven't got an escort - But it's true, isn't it? But, you could pretend, couldn't you? Hello, Cynthia. Don't bother coming up. I'll just barge in Yes, Miss Marybelle, you barge in all the time Margie! May I come in? - Hello, Marybelle - Hi, Mrs. McSweeney. Hi, Margie. Brrr, is it cold! - Aren't your legs freezing? - Oh, sure, but they'll thaw out These just came from Johnikins. I simply had to show them to you Aren't they simply divine? Aren't they simply too gorgeous for words? Two orchids! Yes, they're beautiful I suppose you're going with Roy? No, his cold is worse - Oh, that's too bad - But, I'm still going Who with? You'll find out Margie MacDuff I believe you've been holding out on us You're not going with Mr. Fontayne? Are you? They say Frenchmen dance very well What time is he coming for you? I really couldn't say Margie, do you think this ribbon is too much? Yes, I do! It looks terrible You're right, Margie. It's much more . . . As Mr. Fontayne would say, much more chic without the ribbon Well, so long, Margie I'm going to take a two-hour bubble bath in a simply terrific perfume I have Which absolutely is guaranteed to intoxicate men by its fragrance Goodbye Bye Though April showers, may come your way They bring the flowers that bloom in May So when it's raining, have no regrets Because it isn't raining rain, you know It's raining violets And when you see clouds upon the hills You soon you will seecrowds of daffodils So keep on looking the blue bird And listen for his song Whenever April showers come along If I may make a suggestion, Mr MacDuff You would be well advised to take one bolt each of our #47 - It's one of our best sellers - Very well, sir. One bolt each. And now, Mr. MacDuff, I'd like to show you a new line which we are just handling These are perfumed, hand-dipped candles made especially for us in Nicaragua Nicaragua? Made, no doubt, at the point of our bayonets! I beg your pardon, sir? Have we taken the Marines out of Nicaragua yet? No! Oh, but these particular candles . . . Don't talk to me about candles, sir. I'm not interested! Until you can bring me word that our Marines have been withdrawn Yes, yes, of course, Mr. MacDuff. Now these candles are remarkably cheap Nothing is cheap if it betrays the heart and the conscience of America If we can say, "Give us Liberty or give us Death" Then we've no right to tell the people of Nicaragua That they must buy our bathtubs or send us candles instead of enjoying freedom - But, as I was saying, these . . . - Never mind what you were saying, sir I say to you, take the Marines out of Nicaragua Yes, yes, indeed, Mr. MacDuff We Americans fought in 1776, and in 1860, and in 1918, to make the world safe for democracy And we'll do it again, and again, and again So that the flag of the United States, instead of standing for plumbing And bathtubs, and hand-dipped candles Will stand for the liberty of the people of South America! Are you quoting from something? I most certainly am. I am quoting from my daughter! Good day, sir! Get me Walnut 6513 I'll get it, Cynthia Hello Why, hello Angus Hello, Grandma, I hope I didn't disturb anybody Angus MacDuff, stop dithering around You don't have to apologize to call up here. What's on your mind? Why, not a thing, Grandma, not a thing I was just wondering how you were? That's good. And, how's Margie? She's fine Hold the line a second Angus Have you any important engagement tonight? What? Sounds very dull to me. Who is he? Well, yes, he is rather dull, Grandma, but . . . Well, Mr. VanBuren is president of the Forest Acres Mortician Service A rather important competitor And a proposed meeting was to discuss a possible merger of our interests Well, how about merging your interests with Margie's for a change And see Mr. Van Buren on Monday? No, no, of course she's not sick. She's fine. But, you see, it's like this . . . She was going to this high school prom tonight Only this boy's tonsils are swollen and his mother won't let him go out That's a little out of my line, Grandma I haven't danced in 20 years Well, I can assure you it will do you more good to have another fling at it Than merging with another mortician Now,, don't be later than 7 o'clock And Angus . . . Don't you dare show up here without a corsage for her Roses? No, orchids. And Angus? Three orchids! Good bye Grandma? - Yes, dear - Do you mind if I wear my robe down for dinner? I think I'll go to bed directly after we've eaten, anyway You'll do no such thing! You're going to that prom Who's going to take me? Was that Roy on the phone? Are his tonsils better? No, it wasn't Roy. But you're going to have an escort. Now, go on upstairs and get dressed But, who, Grandma? You've simply just got to tell me! - Golly, a person doesn't want to go to a prom . . . - Never mind! You'll find out, and you'll be proud You didn't call anyone, did you? If you called and made somebody take me, I'll never forgive you I didn't call anybody. He called me! And he's a great admirer of yours - Cross your heart? - Cross my heart and hope to die! - Go get ready and fix your hair nice. - Oh, I wonder who it is? Oh, it's not Joe Kelly, is it? He's only 15 and his hands are always clammy Is it Joe Kelly? He's much older than 15 and his hands are not clammy - Grandma? - Yes, dear? Do you remember that bubble bath I gave you last Christmas? I remember, Margie. Would you lend me a couple of packages? I know Marybelle is taking a bubble bath And she says it simply intoxicates men with its exotic fragrance - And so, I thought that . . . - Help yourself, honey Because it isn't raining rainbows, it's raining violets And when you see clouds upon the hills You soon will see crowds of daffodils So keep on looking for a blue bird And listening for his song Whenever April showers come along Oh, Grandma, your dress is so pretty! - Miss Margie, I'll never get you fastened up - I'm sorry, Cynthia Grandma, do you think I look sophisticated? Well, yes. Enough so for your age Cynthia, look at my shoes. Real high heels! - They show off your prety ankles, too - Do you think so? I quite agree with Cynthia.

Oh no! - If you have company . . . - No, I'm free all evening Go on down I've brought along a French theme of Margie's She was anxious to know what grades I'd given her - On a Saturday night, Mr. Fontayne? - It is Saturday? You know, I lose all track of time Who is it Cynthia? Who is it? It's that Mr. Fontayne Oh no! You're joking. It can't be. It's him. I seen him with my own eyes. And he brung some flowers for you, too. Oh, it can't be true. I must be dreaming! It's true, alright. He's down there talking to your grandma. Now, come on, hurry up. Let's get things together. Oh, Cynthia. You don't suppose Grandma bribed him to take me on account she knew I didn't have a date? He don't need no bribe, honey He's a young man, ain't he? And you're a pretty girl. I've been trying to tell you that all along. Do you really think he likes me? I've had a crush on him since the first day he came My diary's simply full of him. I've got a terrible crush! Well, he's downstairs and it looks like a two-way crush to me Your granddaughter writes and exceptional theme Now, as a rule, I don't drop around to the homes of my pupils to bring them their grades, but . . . Well, Margie is an enchanting child Child, indeed! Don't be so patronizing! I doubt if you're eight years older Now, Mrs. McSweeney I'll confess that I did lie just a little bit about my age to get on the faculty at Central High Margie is going to the Prom tonight. She's all excited. - Who's taking her? - Her father - How about you? - I'm taking Miss Palmer Oh, the librarian - I know about her - We're just good friends, of course Between you and me, I'd much rather be taking Margie MacDuff - Good evening, Margie - Good evening, Mr. Fontayne! - How pretty you look - Thank you You look really pretty, too. I mean... You look wonderful Why doesn't Cynthia answer that phone? Why, how perfectly lovely of you to bring me flowers Margie, look, this French theme of yours is . . . They're beautiful I am afraid I'm going to wake up and find out this is all a dream Margie, I don't know how to tell you this . . . - It's Wanda Bailey. - Excuse me for a moment. Grandma, look! Isn't it wonderful? Mrs. McSweeney, I am terribly embarassed. I had no idea that . . . Oh, I understand. It's all my fault. No, mine aren't orchids. They're camellias, and they are simply gorgeous! Look, Wanda, I really have to fly now because Mr. Fontayne is waiting Okay, I'll see you at the Prom. Bye Wanda thought I couldn't go to the Prom on account of Roy's tonsils But when I told her that Mr. Fontayne was taking me, she was absolutely speechless You know, I'm gonna put this card in my scrapbook and keep it forever . . . - Ms. Palmer? - I'm sorry, Margie. That's what I was trying to explain to you. I merely stopped by to bring you your French theme It's excellent Honey, it's all my fault. I should have told you This is terrible. I'll call up Miss Palmer and explain. She'lll understand. Do not be silly! She wouldn't go with you now in a million years Margie Margie Open your window. I want to ask you something Margie, Wanda just phoned and she said that you said that Mr. Fontayne was at your house now Absotively, he's here. Well, aren't you thrilled to death? She said that you said that he brought you a gorgeous corsage of camillias Oh, they're not bad Say, listen, Margie. We have a big table for eight. Why don't you and Mr. Fontayne sit with us? Why don't you, Margie? I think it would be fun to have him at our table Well, it's okay by me, but . . . He's probably made other arrangements Well, why don't you go on down and ask him? Go on down and ask him. He won't mind, just so he's sitting next to you Honestly, Marybelle, you're so funny You're so gullible, just as bad as Wanda She fell for it, too Fell for what? Honestly, it's a scream. I'm not going with Mr. Fontayne He just happened to drop by and I pretended he was taking me just for fun Well, you don't really think I'd be seen at the Prom with a teacher, do you? Didn't he bring you a corsage? Oh, that was absolutely priceless He had a florist box with him and I pretended to think they were for me just to see what he would do And he was so fussed, so embarassed, it was all I could do to keep from . . . . . . to keep from bursting out laughing Honestly, Marybelle. It was a scream! Next year, if Margie has forgiven me by then, maybe you'll let me really take her to the Prom Well, we'll see. Good night. There, there, honey, don't cry anymore. - I wish I was dead! - Were dead. Alright. Were dead, then I'll never be able to face anyone again! Ever! Oh, rubbish! Of course, you will.

Well, you wouldn't want him to go to the Prom in a tweed suit, would you? He's taking you! That was the big surprise Honestly, Papa? You're taking me? Are you sure you want to? I've waiting over 16 years for the privilege Orchids! Three of them! Grandma? I hope you won't be disappointed, Margie. I'm not a very good dancer I'd rather be going to the Prom with you than anyone else in the whole world A penny for your thoughts, Angug?

Who am I going to read poetry to now? Not me! Hey, kids, look! - Mr. Fontayne, how you've changed! - I beg your pardon? I want to explain to you what happened Honey, it doesn't matter.

You know, Margie, you really had them all fooled.
