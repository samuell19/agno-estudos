[English subtitles are available.] In 1945, we won the war. And now, the beauties at home are awaiting us. Shut up, Bill. This place feels a little odd. Did you just see what I've seen? Are you OK? What the hell is that? That's just one ugly-ass bird. Andrew, you have to see this. Incoming! Andrew! Answer me! Open the parachute! Negative! Negative! no chute ! no chute! You're a lucky bastard! Although you're the head of the family the kid is ours So we should give him a name together. OK. You give him the surname, and I his first name. Honey, his surname is a sure thing. Make your choice then. Excuse me, sir. Hello. Hi, did you name your daughter by yourself? Why should I tell you? What's there to argue about? Perhaps your kid will change his own name one day. Whoa What the heck does he mean? Uncle, I See you around. Go. Who is he? I'm talking to you. Please be quiet, sir. Thank you. Didn't you hear me? Who's that guy? Didn't you hear the stewardess? Turbulence is normal. Please don't panic. Ladies and gentlemen, as the cabin is depressurized please wear an aerobic mask Please pull down the mask and breathe normally at the mouth and nose Ladies and gentlemen, as the cabin is depressurized mayday mayday. This is flight GZ261.The cabin is depressurized. Please allow the plane to lower its altitude and keep it at Have we deviated to the sea of Dragon Triangle due to the magnetic interference Descending Captain speaking. The situation is under control. We're safe now Are you still in the mood for that? None of your business Is it a bird? Horizontal tail is out of control. I'm working on it! Prepare for sea landing. This is captain speaking. Brace for impact! Get down! Don't come out. Got it. What is it? What's that? What? What's that? Come on, look. It's going to blow up. Hang on! Dad! Hang on! Hang on! Don't worry! Hang on! Get ready for impact! We made it! oh my god Yiyi. Yiyi. Wake up. Come on. Get up. Let's go. Are you okay? Yiyi. I have a stomachache. Do you have any medicine? How do you feel? Be careful. How do you feel? How come? Yiyi Are you okay? Are you all right? Here. Put it on. Hey guys. If you have a chance to see this video I just want to tell you Just a while ago, we had an air crash But what you might never imagine is that, oh my god, I saw a weird creature! Busted. Let me check. It's broken. My cell phone has no reception either. Where are we supposed to be now? Perhaps we are in the sea of Dragon Triangle in the North Pacific between Indonesia and the Philippines. I've read the flight information before the plane crashed. Now we are somewhere in the sea of Dragon Triangle Suppose the rescue team learns of our coordinates, however… it's gonna take at least 24 hours… What? 24 hours? But all I've got is just this bottle of water! What do you do? Well, I'm a… -I'm asking him. I'm a college student at the University of Melbourne What major? History. Why history? You haven't even figured out yourself. Mister, don't always treat me differently. That's what college students are like these days. I won't allow you to go out with my daughter. Am I clear? We must stick it out. We're now working on it. There must be someone to save us. Don't lose your heart. Darling, will our baby be all right? Yes. Sit down here. Thank you. Thank you. Have a rest, honey. Easy. Let me see if there's a doctor. OK. Tension between father and daughter? You can have tension with your dad. But you can't with me. Not with me. You got it? My dad and I have just finished my mom's funeral in Australia. Oh. Thank you. Hey, girl. I'm pregnant. How long have you been together? It's been a year. A year? Don't you know she is still underage? Underage? Yiyi was born in 2000. She's 19 years old now. Mister, don't you even know how old your daughter is? Hey, look. A knife. There's a notebook here. Seems it's left behind by someone with the air force back in World War II The location of water is recorded here. What about the plane? The plane… It's crashed. Its communication equipment should still be working then. You are telling me. Hold on. It says that, on this island, there's a… a giant crocodile! Yiyi. Open your mouth. Have a sip. Drink some water. Drink. Open your mouth. Get up! Get up! Get up! -What Are you doing? -Listen to me. You better turn your back on them. It's a waste of resources. Should I… Should I watch them die… It's just they could still move, but they are essentially no different from corpses. Give It back to me. -Give It to me. Give it back to me. Give it to me. What are you doing? Give It back to me. -What Are you doing? Calm down, everyone. Maybe Mr. Lin has found water. Shut the hell up! It's not like everyone is so naïve as you. If, between you and your wife, only one of you can survive at last, you'll definitely choose yourself. How come there is such a huge crocodile on the island? The notebook says it's an estuarine crocodile. Since there's no natural predators it has already dominated this island. Are you nuts? Don't fight! Stop it, guys. Stop it! Don't fight! Cool it! No fighting! Li Zhi! Li Zhi, stop it! Stop, Li Zhi! Stop it! Alright. Can you cut it out? Stop it! Why did you hit me? Li Zhi! Darling. A Croc… crocodile! A crocodile! Crocodile! Crocodile! Oh shit. Li Zhi! Li Zhi! Run, honey! Run! Yiyi. Why are a few bodies gone? Was that giant crocodile here already? Yiyi. Judging from the footprints, it couldn't be a big croc. The bodies… and the supplies. They should be all right. It seems the bodies on the beach have bought them some time. And a crocodile won't take the supplies away. Give me a hand! Now! Go! Move! Run! Slowly, honey. Slowly, slowly. Seems it didn't come after us. Have a break. Have a break. Get a rest. Slowly, honey. Sit down here. Lean against here. Are you all right? Yes. Honey, I can't make it. Let me give you a massage. Honey. Look, we just found the water by accident. So that girl's father and others could have been…. Shut up! What do you mean? I just mean that could be possible. Anyway, honey, from now on, I won't move a step away from you. Shut up! Go have a look. Well… Me? Go ahead! Thank you for saving me. Alright. Don't mention it. Honey. Let's go get some water. Slowly, slowly… Watch your step. Slow down. Nobody move! Yiyi. Yiyi. Are you all right? -Are you okay? -Yes, I am. We found a cabin over there. There are a lot of things in there we can use. Look. If a crocodile or something comes out, then I… Then you what? I don't even believe you stand a chance against a crab. -Mister. -Shhh. What's wrong? Don't move! Help! Help! Help… Run! Run! Look out! Come over here! Go! Yiyi! This way! I can't make it. You just attempted to save that man. You wanna kill yourself? Brat. Let me tell you, bravery and impulse are different. What about bravery and fear? What did you say? Can you just stop fighting? Now we're running randomly, with no sense of direction. That's OK. Although there's no cell phone reception, we can still use the compass in the phone. And even if the phone's battery is dead, we can also get us oriented by a plant's rings or the direction in which it grows. What do you know? I insist everyone should stay close to me. Lin Hao, let's go to the cabin! Let's go! Go! There's really a cabin here. Are you doing fine? -You don't have to care. Easy. Easy. It's okay. What a mess today! A prehistoric crocodile. A unknown island. Who cares? Let's take shelter here tonight. OK. Let's go! You got injured. I'm fine. Get in now. Don't you hear me? Come on, get in, now. We are guarding outside tonight. You hear me? Why do you come out? Get back in now. I found this, and this. See if you can use it to reduce inflammation. Now give it to me. Cheng Jie found it in the house. Do it for me. Here we go. -Bear with it. -Come on! Her dad must be a former soldier. Really? This is the airplane food I picked up today. Let's share it. Did you… start smoking? So what? Take out the cigarette. Is it bad to smoke? When my mother and I were suffering, who were you? Hey, look, your communication skill sucks. You haven't met her for a long time? Four or five years. I haven't met my son for more than a year. I just quit my job so as to go home to be with him. I even brought him a present. He graduated last year. I didn't make it to attend the ceremony. My wife still complained about that. I don't see it's a big deal. Just talk to your daughter properly. It's just smoking. I smoke too. If we hadn't had the air cra… What the hell is that? So the notebook's writer didn't make it at last. It's not like being bitten by a croc. So we must find the wreckage tomorrow. If the communication goes well, we'll be able to leave. Otherwise, if we hang in here for long, we'll die in one way or another. You're quite a stubborn girl. But your dad seems a bit annoying. Although you hate him so much, he didn't stop doing whatever he can for you. Mister. I'm trying to grab some fruits. It's our second day on this desert island. I haven't eaten for two days. You know, I'm risking my life to shoot this video. If I can make it home, you have to give me big presents The battery is dead. Look at the time. Why the waste of power? Waste? Do you know how fierce the competition between cam girls is now? With these videos, I can… What… what's this? This is… It's… What's this? Yuck! What's this green stuff? What's this? -It could be some kind of fruit. Aren't you hungry? Maybe you can eat some. Are you crazy? Why don't you eat it yourself? Take me somewhere to wash it off! Come on! You're awake. Your dad went out to get you some fruit. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Do not make any noise. Darling! -What's this? -A spider! Such size! Oh my god! Such big spiders. Keep calm, everyone. These spiders seem still dormant. So long as we don't wake them up, they should be no threat. Yes. We can't make even a little noise. This cabin is age-old. It's not firm enough. Let's sneak out. No way! My dad isn't back yet! Do you expect him to come back? It's the jaws of death here. Now what? Your dad is awesome. I'm sure he's doing fine. Go! Come! Watch out. Be careful. Take off the clothes. Slowly, slowly. It's Mr. Lu. We gotta wake him up! No! That's gonna kill us! It's all spiders here. I'm going ahead. Don't touch me. Go away! Go away! Don't come over… Back off! Back off! Back off! Up there! Run! Go! Run! Move it! Move it! Come on! Come on! Come on! Yiyi! Run back to the cabin! Now! Move! Move! Yiyi! Yiyi! Yiyi! Yiyi! Back off! OK. Let's go! Move your ass! Come on! Move! This way! This way! Come on! Move it! Move it! Get down! Are they all gone? No. We are surrounded. Yiyi. Dad! Dad! Mister! Get moving! Go! Dad! Come on! Now! Get in here! It's too foggy! We can't see it. It can't see us either. I… I didn't expect it. Go… go! My hometown is Nan... Nan… They must be the fruits he found for us. Cheng Jie! Cheng Jie! Use the axe in your hand! Get going! You'll be all right. We got water. -It's a pond. I feel better now. Are you crazy? I didn't mean to spook you. Liqi. It's such a wonderful place here. Let's have fun. What fun? I'll tell you what, Cao Fang, stay away from me. What do you take me for? Don't play hard to get. Stop pretending. Fuck off! So you're not giving face, huh? Forget it. It's not fun. Don't touch me. Who touched you? Let go of me! Let go! Let go of me! Help me! Help! I'm sorry. Why? I didn't blame you. From now on, I'll never… Although you're a bit rash, you saved my life anyway. I found it. Come on. It's the nose of a WWII carrier. This carrier was meant to transport nuclear materials. Do you mean the creatures on this island are all mutated caused by radiation? It's so beat-up. Can it be fixed? I'll give it a try. Look, honey. -Where did you find it? -In the plane's cabin. Don't fool around. I got it through. Hello! Hello! We are the survivors of Flight GZ261… Yes,in the Dragon triangle sea the crash time is around 13:00... Yes, we're in the... southeast... Please, as soon as possible... And there's a… Hello?! Hello! How is it going? The rescue team is on the way. It's just at sea nearby. They have basically located us based on the time of the crash and sunshine duration. Great! Brat! Your major can't be history! The rescue team should be coming from the southeast. OK. Let's set out now. We won't take a rest tonight. You know the direction. Show us the way. Roger that! I have to go back. I staked everything and finally got a matching heart. I can't die this way. We got another survivor here. Don't bother. I'm the only one left. Where's the girl with you? That girl shooting video. She's eaten by a croc. Yesterday, I saw you turn away from the dying stewardess. I'm warning you, stay away from my daughter. There're only five of you left. Where are we going now? The rescue team is coming from the southeast. We have to swim there. I can't swim. Then I'm taking the lead. If things turn out all right, I'll pull you guys across the river. Yiyi. Don't worry. I'll be okay. Watch out for danger. All right. Get on the raft! Come on! Be careful! Come on! Come on! It's the giant croc! Come on! Li Zhi! Li Zhi! Come on! Li Zhi! Come on! Hurry up! Yiyi! Yiyi!

Come on! Darling! Go! Go! Move! Move! Go! Go! Li Zhi! Go! Let me go! Go! Li Zhi! Let go of me! Darling! Come on! Move it! Move! Go! Go! Go! What are you doing? Get moving, Yiyi! I don't want to die! Do not come after me! Dad! Yiyi! No kidding! It’s almost time... for my heart transplant. Mister. Don't go, you two. Cheng Jie, watch her over. Mister. What're you doing here? To save Yiyi. It's dangerous ahead. You're waiting here. Danger lies in there. Wait for us at the entrance. Yiyi! Yiyi! Yiyi! Yiyi! Yiyi! Yiyi! Dad! Yiyi! Dad! Dad! Yiyi! Yiyi! Dad!

Throw it over to blow the croc up! No way! You'll be involved! Hurry up! Come on, damned croc! Bloody green-skinned monster! Come on! Brat, what are you doing? How was it, uncle? Isn't it cool? What for? I was cooler than you. Brat. Who allows you to call me "uncle"? Get up. It's killed at last. Finally we killed it! Finally! Grab the kill. Let's go. Yiyi is out there. Let's go. Dad. Are you okay? Not really, if you get more excited! Let's move. Uncle doesn't want to stop bleeding with gunpowder anymore. What did you call me? Uncle. Wrong again. Let's go.
