(ominous music) - [Narrator] My name is Captain Brookes. I am a witness. I am part of the filth of it all. Each night, shadows long since dead watch me try to flee. All seems fine as the ship sets sail, but at the deepest point in mid-ocean a blackness settles upon our souls. There's an old saying amongst sailors. We have a corpse in the cargo. (many indistinct voices) - No, thank you. - You can see, everything you want. - I said no. - Is nice, you can buy it for your girlfriend. - Yeah, my girlfriend. - Yeah, you can do it, no? - I can't buy this crap. (muffled upbeat music) How much is it? I'll give you five. Okay, 10, more than it's worth. All right, my last offer, 15. 'Cause it's your lucky day. 15 for a fucking bangle! - It's not for you, and it's not for sale. - Fuck you. (shouting) Piss off. (shouting in foreign language) Very funny. - Passport? - Okay? What? - Visa. - I'm from Germany, it's a European passport so I don't need a visa. I don't understand. - Come with us. (shouting) (intense music) (horns honking) (mellow guitar music) (singing in foreign language) - Hey, listen, patience, sunshine. Don't fuckin' touch me, I'll fuckin' beat you, all right? Oh, you fuckin' watch what you're doing, sunshine, and take your fuckin' stuff. Thank you very much, thank you. You fuckin' blinter cunt. - Blind as a bat, aren't ya? My name is Chris. - Hi. - A pleasure. - Are you guys together? - We work down at the docks, on a ship. - Them too? - You? - Trying to get home. (laughing) - You might wanna see this. - What is this? - An export license. You'll have no problems, don't worry. - I like to worry. - I swear you'll have no problems. - How many can you get? - As many as you can pay for. - Fuckin' scare it, you mad bastard. - How much is it worth? - About $700. - Fuck, better than the last time. - Aye, if they survive. - Make them survive. We lose the birds, we lose the fucking ship. - Where you heading? - Marseilles, France. - On a ship, you understand? On a ship. - I wish you the best. - No. - Come on, man, have a drink. - I said no. - You put the money up your ass, you wanker. Come here. (boat horn blowing) - I'm with them. Heading for Marseilles. (laughing and singing drunkenly) (dog barking) (squeaking) (rumbling) (birds squawking) - Move it, move it! Get that back up there, now! Incoming, incoming! Incoming! Keep going, left, then. All right? - Did we get enough of this stuff to last for 10 days? - They'll be fine. - What? - They'll be fine. - What do you fuckin' know about it? You don't, for fuck's... They know. I can tell, I can tell. - Herman. - I can tell, you know? - Herman. Just let it go, okay? Just let it go, it'll go. Okay? (rumbling) (ominous music) (birds singing) - Shut up! (gasping) Are you an animal, yes, I'm an animal. Are you a machine, yes I'm a machine. (thudding) I saw you! I fucking saw you! Come down here! Now, now! Fuck you. Come here! What the fuck you laughing at? Come here. Closer. Closer. One word, and I'll cut your fucking throat. (ominous music) - So. - It's a long story. - Cut it short. - I picked up a truck in Spain with spare parts. - All stolen. - I'm not a thief. I just helped my mate to drive it down, and he went back to pick another truck and I stayed there and I was curious to see the place, I bummed around, and got mugged, and some stupid bastards stole my money and my passport. - What kind of passport? - What difference does it make? I'll work my way. - My little cheruby friend, you are a stowaway. Fines, police. Courts, immigration. You're about as welcome as a hedgehog stuffed up my ass. - What passport? - German. A European passport. - How much money was in his wallet? - About $50, I'll pay him back, I'm sorry. But when I heard Marseilles, I couldn't believe my luck. I took a chance. I want to get home. - So you risk our home. - What do you mean? - You can work with the Baptist. - I don't need him. - In the kitchen. - I prefer not. - In the kitchen. Take him to his bunk. Room number nine. Room number nine. - If you don't mind, Captain. - I do mind. (loud engine noises) (ominous music) - You're in there. - What's wrong? - You shouldn't be here. - Who the fuck are you? - Name is Chris. (muffled radio chatter) - Can I help you? - No, I just heard the voices. Nobody was here, so... Any normal people on this boat? - Just one. - Who's that? - You. - Why you called the Baptist? - I used to baptize people. - Not any more? - I'm doing nothing any more. I cook, that's it. - You're no ordinary cook. What are you doing here? - You be careful. Seven days to go. Head down. Mouth shut. Get off this boat. - Hey, Fifi. Toilet time. What the fuck are you laughing at? Toilets. (muttering angrily) - "Rebecca. "For nothing is sacred that shall not be made manifest." (shouting) What the fuck is wrong with him? - I don't know, I don't know. (singing incoherently) - Jump, jump, jump, jump! - Can't go home, can't go home, can't go home. They've come back, they've come back. They've come back! - You have to come down. Down. You have to come down. - Excuse me. Tweety. Can you pass the salt? - Quack, quack, quack. Whatever you're on. - Cheep cheep. Thank you. (squawking) (squawking) (squawking) (clicking) - Stop it! Fucking leave him alone. - We found it by the birds. Wasn't there this morning. - This yours? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Go and look. - Luis. - Yeah. - The two Franks. And you. - No, no. - Now. - Not me, not me! No! (shouting) - Come on. I'll take you. - Where are we going? What are you doing? - Lock the door, shut your eyes, and go to sleep. Now! (birds chirping) (ominous music) (rumbling) (door creaking) (muffled voices) - [Male Voice] I don't trust him, we should just get rid of him. (splashing) (shouting in a foreign language) (splashing) (splashing) (chatting in a foreign language) - What did I tell you last night? Where did you sleep? - The captain wants to see you. (ominous music) - [Brookes] Come in, Chris. Do you have family, Chris? - Yeah. - You must miss them. - We are close. - Did you sleep well last night, Chris? You seem tired. - Fine, thanks. - Sweet dreams? - I never dream. - Ah. Clear conscience. - And you? - Didn't sleep a wink. Why did you stick up for Herman? - I don't know. - There's always one. - It just happened. - One against the gang. Takes courage. I admire that. What was the moment? What was the moment when you just thought, enough? - What fucking difference does it make? (ominous music) God. Fuck. (squawking) - You know, don't you. They know, they know too. - What? - Don't, don't pretend. I know that you know. You know! - What are you talking about? - About the boy, the boy. - What boy? - The boy! And Rebecca! Don't pretend, you know, you know! - I don't understand, I'm sorry. (sighing) - They've come back. - Who? - Come back. - It's nothing, Herman. Just cool it. - You know. - Herman. Herman? (banging) - Fucking liar. - Search the place again. Find 'em. (knocking) Down there. Only yourself with Herman. Did he mutter anything that might help us? He does mutter, doesn't he? You're a curious lad. What did you ask him? - Why he climbed the mast. - What did he say? - He told me about the birds. How they can fly back home thousands of miles to the same old nest. - He swore they sense something that we miss. What do you make of that? What's in the hold, Chris? I said, what's in the hold? - What do you mean? - What's in the hold, Chris? - Cocoa. The hold is full of cocoa. - Chocolate. Have you ever asked yourself why you've never sunk your teeth into a bar of African chocolate? Go feed the birds. (squawking) (rumbling) (ominous music) (rumbling) (footsteps) - Ooh, right on the edge. - Somebody's down there. Who was Rebecca? - You shut the door, turned the lock, and went to sleep. Don't ask me anything. (ominous music) (whistling) (squawking) - What the fuck is that? Herman? Is it you? Shut up! What the fuck is this? You, go there. (rumbling) (metallic creaking) (groaning) - Who are you? (whispering in a foreign language) What do you want from me? Huh? Subira? Are you called Subira? Yeah? - [Rhombus] Chris! Where the fuck are you? - We landed in Europe with the stowaways. They were arrested in the dock, ship tied up. Couldn't pay the fine. A big fuckin' fine. We lost her. Our ship. Rebecca. Our home. We swore if it happened again we would take measures. Family measures, to defend our ship. 18 months ago it happened again. Stowaways. Herman found them. One by one we threw them over. We all agreed, all took a turn. All but one. He refused. - What happened? - He called the coast guards. The last thing he ever did. - God. - Tell me the truth, Chris. What happened down there? - I swear I didn't see a thing. - The men say you lie. I believe you. They're scared. Scared of you. When we're scared, we change. I thought maybe... Maybe we could help one another. (whistling) (thumping) (squawking) - Where is Luis? (door opening) - The fuck? Frank? What do you want from me? (shouting) No, no! No! - Where the fuck is Luis? Where's Herman? - I swear I don't know! - I don't believe you! - I didn't see anything! But I heard something! I don't know who took Luis, but I heard footsteps! I swear! I brought down some food! - Where did you leave it? (breathing heavily) Where did you leave the food? - Behind the water barrel. - He's a fucking liar. - No, wait, wait, wait. We'll soon find out. Chris. (door slamming) (electronic beeping) - What is it? - I want you to see something. - What are they doing? - Thanks to you, we found him with the barrel. This is how it is, Chris, this is how it works. - You can't do that. Stop them! Stop it! Stop it! No! (splashing) - You're either with us or you're against us. - Ah, Filio, Filio, I feel I've got that chicken flu coming. (coughs) (laughing) I just want to ram-bam-boom sing my song, baby. (cheering) Ah, Chrissy, you're one of us now, baby. You are one of us. How does it feel to be one of us tonight? (laughing) - Take a little drink, Chris. Sorry, Fifi. - Chris, Chris, Chris! (all chanting) (cheering) - Another one for the road! (all chanting) (cheering) - [Rhombus] Our little Fifi! - Where is he? - Get up. Get up! Come on. (gasping) That's better. Don't let them break you. (shivering) - Get your fucking hands off me! - I tried to protect you from all this. I tried, I really, really tried. - All I did is leave some food. - It's okay, it's okay. Take it easy. - I don't understand what's going on. - You will. - I don't know what happened to the others, I swear. - Christopher. Why are you willing to risk your life for people you don't even know? You don't know yourself, do you? - What are you going to do with me? - Depends on you. (ominous music) (birds chirping) (speaking foreign language) - I don't understand. I don't understand! I don't know where he is. I don't, I don't know! Yeah, but I don't know where he is. I don't know where he is. I don't know! I don't know! Back off! (crying) (ominous music) - Jesus Christ. Everybody up! Up, up, up! - Herman, Luis, and the two Franks. - Fuck off! Get the weapons. This time, every square fucking inch. Go! (intense music) - Nothing. - Forecastle, nothing. - Nothing, okay. Search the place again. - There's no one here. (groaning) (squawking) (distant thumping) - Fuck. - What are you doing? Come back here. Come back here! What the fuck are you doing? Okay. Okay. Okay. Fuck off, all. - You'd better take it down. - You've known all along? She's a girl. Her name is Subira. Don't even speak the language. - Anybody else? - No. - See if you can find her. I'll meet you by the barrel. - Subira. Subira! I wanna help you. It's okay. Someone's gonna help us, okay? No, no, no, it's a friend, it's fine. (dramatic music) Fuck. Baptist. - Run, run! Run, run! (shouting in a foreign language) - Are you all right? - Captain. (speaking foreign language) - I know his name! Abrahim. Now, how did I find him? Hmmm? Ask Chris. - No. Don't listen. (speaking foreign language) Don't listen to him. He's lying. (speaking foreign language) Don't listen to him, I swear. - We'll find them, Captain. - No. No, she'll find me. How's Ramazan shaping up in the kitchen, is he capable? - This is all wrong. - Neither right nor wrong. Jesus. What did Chris do to you? - He might save us all. - I chose you first, you were my favorite. You were the closest to me. - I've been quiet too long, hmm? It's not too late. Even for you. It's never too late. - Yeah, yeah. - You can be a good man. - Mm-hmm. It's time. Cut the engines. Subira. Such a beautiful name. - Chris! Look at my new whore! Nice, very nice. Captain wanna see you. - Fuck. - [Rhombus] Come out, Chris, or she's gonna die! - What happened to the Baptist? - In vain, as always. - Let her go. It's not her fault, let her go. I beg you. - She doesn't beg. - What the fuck is wrong with you? What's wrong? Stop this madness. - It's too late. - What happened in room number nine? - Gulls, Chris. Gulls. Self-centered, single-minded survivors. Will you gull with us? - What the fuck are you talking about? - All bar one went against the gang. Fighting, kicking, screaming. He wouldn't shut up. And then he made that call. - What happened in room number nine? - Gulls. They devour their own. - He was your son. - I broke his neck in room number nine. And I threw him in the sea. No fucking getting back from there, is there? - Yes. By letting her go. And me too. - I can't. It's gull day. - No. - Take them up. - No, I know you can. You can do it. You can save us. Save yourself. Do it for me. Think of your son! - Gull with us, Chris. You're either with us, or you're against us. - Subira. Subira. Subira! - Leave him, leave him, Ramazan, leave him. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. (breathing heavily) - Rot in Hell, Brookes. - Chris! Where are you? Where are you? Oh, Chris. Get him out. Ralph. I want everyone off this ship. - What about the girl, Captain? - Leave her be. Just leave her be. Take the keys to the safe, take the money, and go. Go. All of you. Save your miserable souls. Everybody. (somber music) (ominous music)
