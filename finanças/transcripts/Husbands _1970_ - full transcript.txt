Throw the way she counts. One, two, three, four, nine. Here we go! Come on up here and let's finish this one over here. Go! I suppose this is proper, all these big cars and chauffeurs. Black shiny cars. Seems dopey for a guy like that. Well, I guess that's what they do. People get symbolic over death. They get very formal, and it's really ridiculous. Because it's probably the most humiliating thing in the world. But I feel very relaxed. People die of tensions. That's all they die of, Gus. That's the truth. Did you know that? I know it, and it's something I'm never gonna forget. Don't believe truth. Just don't believe truth. Archie, I'm telling you, don't believe truth. That is the truth now. You see, the truth will never kill you. Lies will. Not cigarettes, not alcohol. Lies, Gus. Lies and tensions. That'll kill you. That'll kill you before cancer in the heart. Did you know that? Now, give me a cigarette, will you? Give me a cigarette. - What, now? - Yeah, now. And give me a match, too. I don't have any matches. I don't know if I have a match. I don't think I have a match. - I don't have any. - I don't have a match. Harry! You got a match? Let us be grateful for the smiles. Let us not think of sadness. Let us bury this man who has gone noisily through life and made a quiet exit. Who found time for the smallest child and for the oldest man. Who found time in his life to make room for your lives. A man who was respected and honored and loved by the fellow members of his community. When we speak of a man that's naive and full of innocence, we think naturally of Stuart Jackson. I recognize some, I don't know others, but I know one thing. That you're all saddened. Saddened by the loss of what we all consider a great, great friend. Not a friend in need particularly, not a friend giving to a friend. Not really there to listen, but a person who made you feel that you belonged. This was a man beloved by his dear wife and beloved by his two children, who now have a great void to fill in their lives. This Stuart... This Stuart, a man with so many friends, as you see here today, that are deeply, deeply affected by his loss. Let us offer God our prayers for his eternal soul. And now a silent prayer. A silent moment to recognize Stuart Jackson. - I'm so glad... - It's okay. I'm glad you could come. I didn't like it. I didn't like what he said. - I'm not going home. - It moved me, but I resent it, - 'cause what he said, he said nothing. - You know what I resented? - I mean, say this, just say he was funny. - Gus, you know what I resented? Say he was a funny man. There's a dead man laying there, - and she's moved, you know that. - 'Cause if you can't say the right thing - when a man dies... - But you don't talk about insurance... ...then what the hell is it all about? Not at a time like that. You don't talk about insurance, you understand? - Not at a funeral. - One thing, he was a clown. Say he was a clown, say he died too young, and that's all, and that's it. - You understand what I mean, Gus? - Look, it's done! It was done wrong, but it's done, so be it! Well, I'm not going home. So we'll... I'm gonna get very drunk. Whatever. That's right. Your coat's seen enough. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Gussie. - Yeah. - Gussie. - What? Well, what are we gonna do? Well, we can do anything we wanna do. So what do you wanna do? I mean, what do you prefer to do? I mean, if you had a preference? Well, I'd be a professional athlete because they really put out. And they got no excuses, and they feel good, and they get sweaty. You know, you have a beer, and you're with guys you like. I was gonna be a basketball player. I had all the moves. I was quick enough. Too short. I love baseball. I love golf. I love pool. I love track. I love Ping-Pong. I love volleyball. I love badminton. What else is there? - Football. - Lacrosse! Now there's a hell of a game! What are we gonna do? Harry, you don't care. Archie, I'd like to know how you feel. You know, it's a terribly... It's a terribly sad thing when a man reaches around 27, the years are going by, and then he realizes that he's never gonna be a professional athlete anymore. And then you reach 30! And then you know it's over, and then you begin to watch other athletes and you begin to see when they're gonna give out. - Do you ever feel that way? - I felt that. - Well, the legs go at 35. The legs. - I got a hell of an idea. Let's have a light breakfast. You know what I mean? Why a light breakfast? Why not a heavy breakfast? Oh, Harry... - Harry, Harry, Harry. - I'm hungry. - Light breakfast. - Everything's light. - You get your money? - I got everything. - Okay. - Where we going? We got 40 stops. You're right. Forty more stops. The man is right again. I love basketball. But I'm too short. You want to play? Without my shoes, I'm shorter! I want to play. I'll race you to the corner. Walking, no running. - For how much? - A dime. - A dime. You're on. Yeah. - You ready? - Get set! - Get set! Go! Give back the ball. Got it! Ball! Come on. Come on, Harry. Come on, Harry. Put it up. I hate basketball. And besides, I have a theory about people who play to win. It's the only reason to play. Otherwise why keep score? First, we have to play games, then we have to see who wins. We've been up for 24 hours. And we're gonna get ourselves the same as Stuart. It's good for you. Sweat it all out. - Wanna go home, Harry? - No! I'm never going home. All right, then. Let's have a drink. - Here's to Joe. Here's to Joe. - Here's to Joe. - Joe. - Here's to Joe. To Joe. To Joe. All right, next. Charlie? I'm not any Joe, but... Maybe the original soul... - I'm sorry. - All right, next. Okay. That was terrific. I'm sorry. Gus, you broke the rules. - Who's next? - Gotta keep the rules. No talking. - Tony, Tony's next. - No, Gwen. - Gwen. - Gwen is next. Gwen, you go. Look at me! That's better. Don't know anymore. Give her a hand. Let's have a drink. Terrific. Terrific. Terrific. Beautiful. Okay. - We're terrific. - Terrific. - Who's next? - He's next. No, no, ladies first. Now, this is First World War. Wonderful. Wonderful. - All right. - Leola. - All right. Who's next? - My Leola's next. - Who's next? Who's next? - No, no, ladies first. Leola. Well, go ahead, John. - Please. Please. John. - Go, John. Go, John. I love it. I love it. I'd like to hear that one again. Can I hear that one again? Bill was all right, but... I mean, I have nothing against Bill. It's just that I have a song that means, well, it takes life. You'll see what I mean. It means life. Shut up, Gus, shut up. Shut up, Gus! Shut up, you moron. Bravo! Let's drink to that. Come on... You're an angel. Okay. All right. You're right. You know something? She felt a rejection. Let's sit down. Hold it here. Here, here, here. - Violence is out. - Sit down. - Wait a minute... - Violence is out. This contest is not over. And this contest is going to continue. Look, just to show you how wild this party is... - Who threw that glass? - Wait a minute. Number one, who threw that glass? I'm gonna leave here. I'm gonna leave here. Leola! Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Unreal, unreal! No passion. One more time. One more time. Start it again. Come on. Gus, do you hear, Gus? - Start it again, honestly. - Honestly. - Honestly, but I had too much beer. - With soul. Soul. - Soul? - With soul. - With passion. - That's what Harry does all the time. I don't believe he does that. The man is insane! - I'm telling you... - From the beginning. - Did you hear what he said? - Worse. - Did you hear what he said? - Worse. - What? - Worse! No feeling, he said. - Vomit. - No feeling. A little feeling. A little feeling. - I don't care. Loud, soft, do it. - Go get her, Archie. No, too cute! Too cute! No cute! Real, from the heart! From the heart! From the heart! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! - I'll kill myself. - He's right. This man is right. The man is right. When the man is right, he's right. One more time. It's not that we're criticizing you. - It's that... - We're criticizing you. Whatever your life is, it's been... - Obviously. - You're not speaking to us. Do you understand? You're not speaking to us. - No? - You're not talking to all these people. - Look at... - You're not speaking to anybody. Not only us. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. Wait a minute. - Get him. - You are terrible! You are impossible! You're wrong! You have no heart! - You're wrong. - No. A lot of people won't agree with this, but I think you're terrible. - Really? - I think you're terrible. - You know why? - Terrible! 'Cause you wanna be terrible. You know why? - 'Cause you don't like us. You know why? - Right. Right. Because you got some bitterness in your heart... - Totally. - ...'cause you've been told by your mother... - Where's the warmth? Where's the warmth? - ...to be that way. - Where is the warmth? - Give us a kiss. - Right. - Kiss him, he's my friend! Here, here's a face, kiss him. Suck him. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it, Archie. - Don't do that again. - No, I... Don't do it again. Ever. Ever! - One more time. - Do it better. - Do it better. - One more time. Would you do it better? - Can you do it better? - We love you! I'll take off my clothes if you do it better. - Take off your clothes. - Take off your clothes. - I'll take off my clothes if you do it better. - Take off... - If you do it better. Give her a chance. - Take off your clothes. - Give her a chance. - Wait a minute. I'll take off my clothes if you do it better. - That's how much I want it. - Take off your clothes. No, I don't want you to take off your clothes. I'll take off my clothes. Here they come, baby. Here they come! Here they come! Here they come! Now, do it better! Now, do it better! He's drunk. I broke my zipper. I think he's fantastic. Let's give him a big hand. Let's give him... Sing it. Sing it once. Sing it once. Come on! Come here. - All right. - Ready. - I'm sorry. - That's life. - Now let us sing it, and you listen. - That's life. - Life. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Eleven. Why don't you sing it again, all right? - To me, to me. - Kiss him, my friend. Kiss him, he's my friend. She has to get it out. - Better! - Hey, that's nice. Now let's see them... Show him and close your eyes. When you sleep, do you close your eyes? Relax. Close your eyes. You're asleep. - All right. - You're asleep. Ready? - Yeah. - Ready. Kiss her. I'm telling you. I'm gonna fuck her. I got you now. - Telephone. - Please. - She can't be honest. - Give me that mouth. Look here. Put that in your mouth. There you go. - I don't... That's all right. - You're all right. - Now sing it. - Have fun! - All right. - Have fun when you're singing that song. Have fun when you're singing that song. - Where's the song? - Listen to her. - I... - No! - Fuck it. Fuck it. - Here, here, here. Whisper, whisper. Quiet. I don't wanna hear you. I don't wanna hear you. - Nobody hears you. - Just talk it. Talk. - Nobody hears you. - You just told me not to talk. Just talk it. Talk it. Talk it. Let her talk. Too loud. - No, no, no, no, no. - Tell her... - I'm gonna leave. - Listen. Can't you do this? - Can't you do this? Can't you do this? - Why? - Go. Do it. - Do it! Let's do it together. - Can't you do what I just did? - Let's do it for her. - No, 'cause you scare me. - Wait a minute, sweetheart. - Sweetheart, let's do it for you. - Here we go. Together. - No, we don't scare you. That's the trouble. - Shut... I don't want to hurt you, I swear to God, but I feel like Jack the Ripper. - We don't scare her, that's the trouble. - Okay, don't be scared. - You don't even hear this. - Watch this now. - No, don't you sing. Don't you sing. - Okay. All right. Don't you sing. God almighty, don't you sing. - I'll show you how to sing it. - Ready. - Go ahead, would you sing her? - Sing it for me, Archie. L just did it. Now do that. - That's... - You're getting it. You're getting it. You're getting it. You're getting it. Wait a minute. - No, I don't think I can do it now. - That's better. - That's terrific. That's honesty. - You're terrific. - You're terrific. We love you. - That's honesty. - I like that very much. - You think we're kidding you? We love you. - No, why... - We love you. Sing it to us like you love us. - I forgot the words now. - Good. That's good. You're beautiful. Bravo! Bravo! - Listen. - What are you doing here singing? Why don't you sing us all a song? - In your suit. - In your... - In your suit. In your suit. - Come on. - Wait 'til I have a shooter. - He's gonna have a shooter. - I'm gonna have a shooter. - I'll have a shooter. Come on. Sit down here. - Harry looks lovely. - Looks lovely. I'm miraculous, and I'm very gracious. I think you're the most gracious guy in the world. Now will you sing something, because we got a prize going here? Right. No rush there. What a humor you have. Too much. Can't see his eyes. Depression song. No, I can't spare a dime. No, don't hold back. Have another drink. - I've made my decision. - Where are you going? - I got the winner. - Listen. - Yeah? Who's the winner? - What's your name? - I'm not telling. - Red. - Red. - Red what? - Where you from, Red? - Where am I from? - Where you from? - Wherever that nutty in the room is. - You're from... You're from... - I'm telling you... Hey, man, hold it now. Wait a minute. Don't get... - Where are you from, that's all? - You're from... You can guess the rest of your life, you'll never know where I'm from. You're from the Southwest. - Yeah, you're from... - New York! Manhattan, baby. He's won the friendship award. You're terrific. You're terrific. Oh, my God. - This guy's terrific. - Give him a big hand. - Brooklyn. - He hates it. It's Brooklyn, right? That's Brooklyn, of course. What would it be? Love your hat. Love your hat. He could've done this, look... Need any help? We're gonna forget what we know. Nothing else in my favor. Can you imagine, after all we've been through, not to be able to vomit? I didn't... I figured this thing out, psychologically. This thing of vomiting... This thing of vomiting is psychological. Are you all right? Gus, are you all right? Shit. Shit, vomit. Vomit, shit. Have you had enough? That's better. Get it out. You know, you guys look terrible. I have such pains and heat here. Suffocating! My eyes are tearing. I get the feeling you want to be alone. So, why do I get the feeling that you want to be alone? At first, there were four of us. And now there are three of us, and you want to be alone. All right. Then I might as well be alone. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. Gus, I feel sick. And I don't like to be sick in front of people. I mean, people barging in on you when you're sick... - I agree with you. - I asked you not to say anything. Now, you're either going to be quiet, or you're gonna go. - Okay? - Okay. Gus, nothing! Silence! Silence? - Boy, I feel like screaming. - I don't care what you feel. I don't care... I want to tell you how I feel! Listen, Gus. Gus, I want to tell you how I really feel. I mean, I want to tell you what's really bothering me. I'm going to tell you now what it is. What it must be. 'Cause it's not the sickness. I can live with that. No, here's what it is. It's a tremendous need. An anxiety. It's a... You see, that's what happens. I forget what it is. I mean, what is it? It's got to be important. Right? 'Cause, well, like, what are you feeling? I mean, what are we supposed to be feeling? 'Cause what I'm feeling... I don't know what I'm feeling! You see what I mean? In other words... You see, it's... I've got to find out because I know what it is. No, no, it's a... - There's a need there. And there's anxiety. - It's guilt. - Guilt? - Guilt. Guilt? - That would be terrible. - It's terrible. God, oh, God. God. - That would be terrible. - What is it? Just say what it is. - I'm not gonna say it. It's not that. - Just say, "I'm guilty," that's all. I never had bad thoughts. I swear to God I never had a bad thought. If I died yesterday, I'm clean. Gus, I'm an idealist. - I'm a positive person. I mean, as long as... - You're an idealist, you are. As long as you've known me, I've always tried to see the good side of everything. I mean, whenever possible, is that right? You want to be alone? You want to be alone? Be alone! - Let the dead lie. - Let the dead lie? - Let the dead lie! - Let it go. It's a proper thought. No, it isn't. What a smell! What a terrible smell. I really hate it. I hate vomit. You get all the blood out of it, just disgusting. - Hey, you got something on your mouth. - Just disgusting. Right there. Right there, right there, right there! Right there! Get me a paper! I know it's there. Get me some paper! Hand me the paper! Got something on your foot! You got something on your foot there! You got something on your foot there, too! You got something on that foot there! Right there! Right there. - Where? - Right there. Come here. Come over here. Come over here. Oh, you stink. Oh, you stink. Oh, that silly son of a bitch is on the door. I feel very good. Very good. - What are you guys doing in here? - Having a private moment. - Private moment about what? - About Stuart. About Stuart? Expect me to believe that? Every time my back is turned you guys are whispering about... Every time my back is turned you guys are talking. Talking. Whispering about me. - Are you kidding? - Talking behind my back. I've been onto you for a long time. I just have too much class to spell it out! - Why don't you spell it out? - I could never talk to you. - You're insensitive! - I'm insensitive? - And you're insensitive! - I'm insensitive? You're sensitive? You can't even vomit. Make your point. Harry. You get to work on time. You fawn over your wife. You're absorbed by yourself and you have no sense of humor. I have no sense of humor? I have no sense of humor? I have no sense of humor? You're clutching at straws. You have nothing. If I said what was really on my mind, you'd be crying. - Say it. - Harry, you're a phony. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm a phony? I'm a phony? Nobody calls me a phony! Bite his finger! Bite his finger! I'm a phony, huh? I'm a phony? No! Nobody calls me a phony! Nobody calls me a phony! No! Nobody calls me a phony! No! Nobody calls me a phony! - No, nobody calls me a phony! - Good friends don't fight! Good friends... - Nobody! - Come here. Come on. Hey, Archie, come here. Shake hands! Come on, now, shake hands! Give me a dime, Archie. Harry, I'll not only give you a dime, I'll give you my life. Now, you want a dime, you got a dime. Give it to me. He won't call her. I'll call my wife and tell her about my friends. What did you do, darling? Went to a funeral. How was it? Marvelous! How's that for a two-day venture? What's my number? I forgot my number. Gus, what's my number? Seven, four, three, two... I know it. I know it. Seven, four, what? Seven, four, three, what? - Seven, four, three... - I know it! I know it. I know it. Loved the answer. "I know it." Give me a beer. God damn! You guys going to work today? Gus? You going to work today? I don't know, Harry. - Archie? - I'm thinking about it. Louder! I can never hear you! Harry, I said I was thinking about it! - Are you going to work today? - I'm thinking about it. Well, I'm going to work today! I'm going to go right home and go to work. - You know, you've got an awful lot to learn. - Let's go home. Gus. You know absolutely nothing about people. Arch. You know you screwed up tonight. - What do you want? - Let's go. I don't know why I bother with you anyway. I hate this man. I hate him. I really hate him. Let's get out of here. Gus, Archie, look what I did to the phone booth. I kicked the hell out of it. Yeah. Like I've been telling my wife for years. Aside from sex, and she's very good at it, God damn it, I like you guys better. I really do. Now, who the hell else could put up with me, huh? I'm a jerk. I know it. So let's go home and get it over with. Gus, I love you. Archie... - Don't do that to me, I'll kill you! - I could kiss you on the mouth. I love you. I love you both. - Get away from me. - Now, let's go home and get it over with. You fairy! Fairy Harry! I wouldn't be surprised! Might be better off! - You're amazing! - He's amazing! You are amazing! I know. What do you want us to do? You want us to go home with you? - Let's go home. - Let's go home. We'll never make the 8:02. We're late. We got 10 minutes. Shave, shower, 10 minutes! Let the cab go! We'll take my car. That's the difference between him and us. If my wife opens her mouth to me about anything, I finish that fast. - You're right. - I walk right in there... I know I'm right. And I spell it out. And that's what you have to do. Right, that's what you have to do. I'm not going to shower for her. If I want to stink, I'll stink. That's my privilege, - and I'm not showering for him. - Right. - I wouldn't shower for you. - Don't. - I'm not going to shave, either. - Don't shave. If I want to be dirty, I'll be dirty. Look, if you want to be dirty, you be dirty. You go ahead and be dirty. You have to be free. You have to be an individual. Where is she? Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I'll talk to her tonight. - Tell her I love her. - All right, Harry, I'll tell her. I love you, too. - You're a bad boy. - I'm not a bad boy! You understand me. If she wasn't your daughter, you'd be on my side. I'm not allowed to say anything. All right, don't say anything. Who the hell asked you to say anything? - Don't say anything. - I didn't say anything! Then don't! I know what side you're on. Just say goodbye for me. Yeah. Terrible. No sensitivity left. You wanna be alone, you can't even be alone in your own house. Look, you don't have to hide from me anymore. I know you don't love me. I just don't like being in a closet. So let's end the suspense. - You know how I feel. - Tell me. I don't want a scene. What about the children? We have three children. They'll do just fine. Mother! Mother, sit down! Look, I love you, and I love the children. I'm telling you that right in front of your mother. I just... I'm just uncomfortable in front of you. That's it. There's nothing personal. Nothing personal. Harry... I just can't stand you. - Annie! - You stay out of this! You stay out of this! Stay out of this. Annie. Annie. - Ma, get the knife. - Annie. - I'll kill him! - Give me that knife. Give me that knife! Give me that knife! Give it to me! - Down on your knees. Down on your knees. - No. Down on your knees. Down on your knees! Now, I'm calm. I'm very calm. You love me? Say you love me. Say you love... Just say you love good old Harry. You love Harry, don't you? Poor working stiff. You love me. Say you love me. Say you love me! Say it! I love you. - Again. - I love you. That's better. That's not so hard, is it? I love you, too. - I'm gonna call the police on him. - Annie. I'll kill him. - I'm gonna call the police on him. - You'll call the police? You're going to call the police? I know how to get to you. - I know how to get to you. - Oh, Harry! Harry! - I know how to get to you! - Don't you hurt my mother! Shut up! Shut up! Get away from me! - Hey, hey! - You satisfied? You satisfied? I'll kill her! I'll kill her! I'll kill her! I'll kill her! I'll kill her! - Open the door! - I'll kill her! I'll kill her! - Open the door. - I'm a funny guy, right? Yeah, yeah, come on! Jesus Christ. All right. All right. I'm freezing. Must be emotional. I must be going nuts. I hate that house. I only lived there because of a woman. You know. The legs, the breasts, the mouth. Well, not anymore. No, sir. Gus. Archie. I'm confused, I tell you. Because I know I'm going to go in that house and I know I'm not going to go in that house, because if I go in that house, I'll only say I'm sorry. So that's it. I'm going away. I got... This and this is... You had a lot of hair then, Harry. I got older. She gets younger. They all get younger. You get older. Well, that's it. I'll go to Africa, Russia, China! I don't care. I don't care. You're not the first guy to ever punch his wife out. - Here he goes again. - I have to agree with him. - You going to start? - Listen, you worry about your family, we worry about our family. That's the way it is. Well, what's wrong with that? Well, you're not worried about our family when you go on like that because... You're going to put me down again, right? - We have our problems, Harry. - All right, I get it. I get it. - I know who my friends are. - It's not all one way, you know! - I'll just go to work and think it over! - Wait a minute. - I'll go to work and think it over, that's all. - Wait a minute. Wait! I'm going to work! You want to go to work? I'll drive you. - Are you going to work? - Harry. - Archie. - I'll get in the car with you. After that, I don't know, because you can be violent. Okay, that's all I ask. Harry, you're a fantastic man, but you can be violent. You guys smell, you know that? How can you go to work like that? You put your fingers in people's mouths all day long. Look at your fingernails. You were right there. Shave, take a shower, something! Change your underwear! We don't like your underwear. Your underwear. What is that, Bahama underwear you got? Child. Children. Will you cut it out? Oh, just cut it out. Just cut it out. I'm in no mood. - Listen... - Lay off! - Harry! - I'm warning you, lay off! Harry, listen. Now, get away from me! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - Look, what are you, an idiot? What are you, an idiot? Wait a... Get your hands off! Doctor will be with you in just a minute. - Good morning. - Good morning. Archie, listen to me. I'm either going to change him into me, or I'm going to change him into... I don't know what I'm going to change him into. His basic problem... Listen to this. He went into the house this morning because he was supposed to. I can't put my finger on what's wrong with that. - That's wrong. Right? - Damn right, it's wrong. - Right. - It's everything. It's the way he walks, the way he dresses, what he thinks, what he doesn't think. It's deeper than that. He's going through a change of life. - Listen to me! I've watched him all week... - I have no time, Archie, I'm... He's definitely going through a change of life. - Could you just hold it one second? - Yeah, but think about that, would you? Tray, please. - Hello. - Hello. You saw my x-rays last Tuesday. - They took x-rays. - Yeah, I saw that. I'm very nervous. I hate dentists. Did Harry tell you that? No, we didn't get around to that yet. You see, once I went to a dentist, and he hurt me. I think I'm allergic to Novocain. I think so, you know? You know, I hate needles and drills, you know? You don't give a gas, do you? No, I really don't know what you're saying. Just open, please. I just want to check your gums. Something wrong, is there? Miss Hines, Miss Hines, what's the matter? I'm sorry, I'm so nervous. I can't stop laughing. Let the doctor check you, Miss Hines. Let the doctor check you, Miss Hines. Relax. I don't want him to do anything. I want to be like this. I'm making an ass out of myself. I told myself that I wouldn't... Look, just open a minute. Hold it, darling. Darling, darling. Take it easy now. I feel... All right, just open now. Just say... Nice and gentle. - I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean... - That's okay, just open, please. Open, open. Say "ah." That's nice. You're in nice shape. Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, there's nothing really wrong? - Just open... - I can't stand this anymore. I got to go. - I got to go, Gus! - Close your mouth for a minute. Okay. Just one second. I can't stand it, either. Hello? - Harry, it's for you. It's Archie and Gus. - Can't talk. Oh, your secretary has it. - It's Mr. Black and Gus to meet you. - I told you to take a message. - But they said it's very important. - I can't talk to them. - They're on their way over to see... - Tell them not to come. Tell them I'm busy. I'm a man of responsibilities. Tell them I'm a man who is responsible. I'm not a bum. And no more calls! So the point is that your product is supposed to make ours... - Harry! - Hi, Harry. - Harry! - Ed Weintraub. Oh, Harry! The times we had together, weren't they wonderful, huh? - Wonderful, wonderful. - Yeah, they're good. Where should we go to? - I don't know... - Let's go! Right this way, Mr. Weintraub. - You guys going with me or not? - Where? Where you going? London. London, England. London, England. London. London, England. Come on, Harry, you're not... The hell with you. I don't need you. You're being serious. - You're a jerk, right? - Right! - I'm a jerk, right? You're a jerk, right? - Yeah, yeah! I'm going to London. - I'm going to London. - You're going to London? - I'm going to London. - Well, if you're going to London and you're going to London, I'm going to London. Okay. All right, you know what we do with this jerk? - We take him to London, right? - Right. We take him to London, we take him to a hotel, we tuck him in, and then we come back home. - That's all right. - Let's call our wives. All right. Hello, Jeanie? It's your Golden Greek. This is your sweet potato. You're sore at me, aren't you, huh? No... We're going to go away with him. We're going to go to London with him. Yeah, we're just going to tuck him in bed, and get him into a hotel, and then we're going to come right back. There is no problem, it's just that, sweetheart, we need our passports. Yeah, Archie and I, we don't have the passports. You know where my passport is? Well, will you go... Will you go over to Archie's house and ask Kate for his passport? Oh, I love you. Yeah, you're terrific. Yeah, you're really terrific. Yeah, I love you, too. Jealous. Can you imagine that? All the women are around me in my office all day long, she's jealous over some foreign country I've never been to before. - I'm very excited. - So am I. Why do you look so worried? I'm not worried. That's good because we're in the middle of the ocean. No sense in being worried in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, right? Right. - How are you, Archie? - Good. Thank you. I had a wonderful flight. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Thank you for flying Pan Am. Goodbye. Hope you had a nice flight. Goodbye, sir. Hope you had a nice flight. Goodbye now, sir. Goodbye, sir. Wet! You have a connecting door, sir, but we'll have to go around. - Everything all right, gentlemen? - What? - What? - What's all right? Excuse me, please. This way, sir. I'll take this one. - American money all right? - Yes, sir. - There you go. - Thank you very much, sir. - There you go. - Thank you, sir. Good day, sir. - Oh, the key. - Have a good day, sir. Look at the bathroom. I like your room, Arch. Look at the rain. It rains a lot in London. I like the rain. Let's take a shower. Let's take a shower and get some sleep, and then we'll order some clothes and get some clothes... That's right. That's right. We'll take an hour's nap. All I need is an hour. We need some clothes. I sleep an hour, I feel like I slept 12. - Oh, boy. - Rain is fantastic. - Then we get some women. - We need some sleep. Harry, my wife is not so good in bed. Maybe that's the answer. I mean, I don't enjoy it that much. I'm very slow. Well, maybe that's the answer. May I ask a question? What does that mean, slow? He's saying you're great in bed, and he stinks in bed, is that right? - Archie! - I never said that. - I don't care. - He doesn't care. If I cared, I wouldn't have any. I don't care either, because there's going to be no more talk. Go out and get it. Is that wrong? Oh, my God. My arm. Oh, my God. There's a cab. Come on. Here we go. - Come on in. - It's England. It's England. We're in England. - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - Do you wish to play? - Yes, we'd like to play craps. - You have craps here? - We got craps. Got everything. - All right, that's what we like. - We need chips. - Chips, right. Get some chips, that's all. - The cashier can help you there, sir. Thank you. - We only have American money. - I see. Can I have it, please? - What? - Can I have it, please? Give him the money. But we're running low on cash. Traveler's checks all right? Traveler's checks, American. Can I see your passport, sir? Just a formality, sir. Show him the passport, Harry. We've got passports. Wait a minute, wait a minute, everything all right here? - Everything's all right. - That's very good, sir. Thank you. - $200 all right? - "$200?" Yes, sir. Would you sign, please? Here you are, sir. $200. - Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. It's your fault we came to London, right? Harry, come on, what about our chips?

Yeah. - Sixteen. - Hello. - Nineteen, thirteen. - Card. Nineteen. You know, the English... People tell you the English are cold and reserved. I really like them. I mean, they're warm. They're giving. They give. At least, I hope they give. Know what I mean? - Here. - Too late, sir. - Fourteen. - Card. Well, you keep them here then, and if you win, I win. I'd rather you played for me anyway. That's why I don't have any of those masculine pretensions, you know, that the man has to run things. I don't believe that's necessarily true. If a woman has a brain, give her the opportunity to use it, along with other parts. - Fourteen. - Card. Right? - You think I'm charming? - Your bet again. Say. You're not going to believe this. I'm looking for a woman. What do you think? What do you say? Well, I don't know anything about that. Because I'm going to tell you the reason. There are these two guys. There's two guys, and they want me to do this thing, and... - Go away. - You mean it now, don't you? - I certainly did mean it. Yes. - Or we'll call the manager. Here's the thing that I'm going to tell you. I'm going to tell you a... I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something now. I... Excuse me, ma'am, don't leave. Don't leave. Listen to me. Here's the thing. I'm looking for... I'm looking for a girl. - Do you know any? - Well, yes, but not the sort... - Come on, lad. - Why are you telling us all this? Because I don't know anybody else in London. That's a joke. It's a joke! I don't think it's very funny. I'm sorry, but we are waiting for somebody. - Right, right. - If you don't mind. - Thank you. - Right. Awful. Right? Awful! - Yes. - Just awful! He's mad. Why don't you sit down? I'll buy you a drink. What do you drink? That's terrific. - What do you drink? - I'll have a whiskey, please. You'll have a whiskey. ls that like Scotch? - Yes, same thing. - Two Scotch. I could drink you under the table. - Bet you couldn't. - Yeah, I can drink you right under the table. I bet you couldn't. Thank you. - How did you know I was a Leo? - How did I know you were a Leo? There were certain indications. I looked into your eyes, I saw it right away. Leo. You must be a... You must be a Sagittarian. Aren't you? Give me a cigarette there, please. That's the most amazing thing I've ever heard. - But you're very short. - I'm a Sagittarian, and I'm short. - Short Sagittarian. - You have such observation powers, I can't believe it, but I have a lot of charm, don't I? Thing is I'm quite tall. Yes, I believe that, but you're also very intelligent and you're... You have a biting tongue. And you're... You... You... I don't know what you do. Let's see. You're a... Gosh, I don't know anything about you. You're a... You're a... Just give me an hour, and I'll think of it. You're... Do you like art, theater, music, language, religion, politics? - No, I don't like politics. - What languages do you speak? - None. - None? - English, I'm afraid. - Do you understand French? - No. - I'm going to give you a little bit of French. Sounds awful. What is it? It was so dirty, I can't tell you. You like Italian? You're making it up. It's not real. It's not real? It's not real to you, but it's real to me. Now watch, can you understand this better? I love you. Or can you understand this better? It doesn't matter if I repeat it again and again. You like... What else do you like? What are the Romance languages that interest you? - What, the sound of them, you mean? - Absolutely. - 'Cause I can't understand them. - Excuse me. I can't understand them, so it's only the sound I can... That you can understand. Excuse me, can we have another Scotch? You can understand... Two doubles, please. You can understand Latin? - No, some Latin. A little Latin. - English, you can understand. Yes. Let me tell you something. Don't move, this is called a whisper. - How you doing? - Fine. Good. Listen, you busy, or you going to leave? All right. I'm doing fine. What did you say? Well, I was just wondering if you were going to hang around or not. Here's the thing. We don't know one another, but my name is Black. I'm Mr. Black. I'm from New York. I just got into town. - Queen. - I'm new here. And I just wondered and wondered if you were a friendly person, or what do you think? Listen, I'm a hell of a guy, and... I uh... I think you're a lovely lady. You interest me. I do? I see, well, I'm going to tell you something now. I'm not very interesting. I'm a very ordinary guy. I got a family. I got two kids, so that... - And that makes it difficult. - But your family is here with you. No. No. No. No, my family is in New York. Yeah. Look, I'll see you around. - I could satisfy you. - Don't do that. Don't do that. - I'm very rich. - Take your hand off there. - Do you want girls? - Take your hand... - I can give you girls. - I don't want any girls. - Do you want boys? - No. - I can give you boys. - Listen to me, listen to me. I'm a very rough guy. Good. Lady... you got your hand on my hand. You've got your hand on my hand. Take your hand off my hand. Take your hand off my hand. Listen to me. You want me to get rough with you? Because I can lose my head if I have to. Lady, I'm not alone. Are you going to take your hand off my hand? No. - You're not? - No. You want me to call my friends? Don't make me lose my head. Take your hand off my hand. Take your hand off my hand. I will take my hand off your hand, but you got to take your hand off my hand first. That's right. That's right. Now, come here. You're terrific. I'll see you around. - He wants bobs. - Give him $3. - You got bobs? - Give him $3. Here take this. That's enough. Come on in. Take your coat? No, no. Can I keep it on? Yes. Take this off. - Who wants a drink? Anyone want a drink? - Yes, please. I think I'll have a whiskey. Whiskey. Harry? Hello, room service. This is Room 426. Mr. Black. Mr. Archie Black. We'd like a bottle of... Bell's. A bottle of Bell's whiskey. And we'd like a... - Anyone want anything to eat? - No, thank you. You want something to drink? I'd like a shrimp cocktail. - A double-shrimp cocktail. - Coca-Cola, please. - One Coca-Cola. - And we'd like... What kind of salad do you have? - I'd like a... - One Coca-Cola. Oh, and one Coca-Cola. I would like a Belgian endive salad. Yeah, a Belgian endive with tomato, and lemon and oil dressing. Anybody want a salad? What kind of soup do you have? Turtle soup. I don't want any soup. Anyone want any soup? Turtle soup? - Not for me, thank you. - No. Okay, well, that's about the order. Bring some olives and some nuts and lots of ice, all right? Thank you. Thank you. Well, can I use your loo, please? - My loo? - Well, anybody's loo. - Well, now. - A loo. Hey, come here. That's Archie's loo, so we don't want to use that loo, so... And that's Harry's, and the one after that is mine. And you'll find it's much more comfortable, and the heat is always on. - All right, Leo? - Yeah. You're inscrutable. - Have a match? - Yeah. Oh, my, my, my', my- Oh, my, my. my... - You all right? - I'm all right. I'm all right. - Is anything the matter, Harry? - That's all right. It's all right. - Do you want me to go home? - No, no, no, no, no. Sit up. Sit up. Now, bend forward. Lean forward. Right. Oh, that's good. Oh, you're wonderful. My wife used to do that for me. Get up. On your feet. Now, walk. Will you excuse us a moment, please? Which is your room? - It's in there. - Go on in. Excuse us. - I'm going in there. - Come on. I left my cigarettes. Sorry. You want the door closed? 'Cause I'll be happy to close it for you, Archie. I want to apologize for the behavior inside. I thought it was crude. And I want to apologize for locking the door, too. - That wasn't necessary. Right? - Fine. I think you're too complicated for your own good. - You think I'm complicated? - Yes, I think you're complicated. Why do you think I'm complicated? Well... Go ahead, be honest. Go ahead, be honest. I don't like your American bluntness. Banging people on backs and calling them "pal." You don't even know them. And I don't like your silly, sniggering, schoolboy friends, either. I think you're nuts. It's okay, 'cause I like nuts. I'm a nut myself. God! That's my throat you're shaking. Get off! - This is called the Greek scissor grip. - Get off me! It's good for Greeks and scissors. You know any Greeks? Any good Greek restaurants, huh? I love it. All right, just relax another second. Relax. Just one second. Relax. Ready? - Just get off of me. - Okay. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Please, sweetheart. Lie down. Just lie down. Lie down a second. - Let me get comfortable, please. - No, no, please. Let go. You're hurting my arm. Thank you. Now. Now. Sweetheart, don't do that. It doesn't make any sense what you're doing here. See, just take that down. What's wrong with your stomach, darling? - Nothing wrong with it. - There is, there's something terribly... There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't want to be touched. - Can I... Can I... - No, I don't want to be touched. - Let me take your shoes off! - I don't want... - Please, let me just take your... - I don't want my shoes taken off! - I don't want my shoes taken off. - I only took one off. The other one stays on. - Just let me take this one. - Get off me. I'm a shoe eater. - Oh, I love that kind of half violence... - Get off me! ...half indolence. Darling, I see everything. I swear. Now put your skirts down. Go ahead. Please, please. And this one, too. I can't stand that. Please. Please. I just wanna see... I'm so drunk. - Stay there, please. Just lie still. - Do you love me? No, I don't. - Please, just lie still. - See that light? - Yon light? - Yes. Yon English light heads blazing bright! Oh, you're mad! Please, lie down. Please, lie down. - Lie down? Lie down. - Yes. Yes, lie down. All right, I will. Just relax a moment. Just relax. Look, it's not that important. Just relax. I'm gonna get you in one second. I'm gonna go mad. - I'm gonna go mad. - No, please, don't go mad. - Please, don't go mad. - I'm going to go mad. You're not going to achieve anything by going mad. I'm not gonna go mad. I'm not gonna go mad. - Now, get off me! - Did someone get on you? - I don't want... I don't want... - Did you know I was schizophrenic? I kill women in bed, then I pick my nose. God. - I'm mad! I'm mad! I'm mad! - Get off me! I'm half mad, half man. I'm half mad, half man. Do you understand what that means? Will you kiss my lip? - Get off me! - Here. This lip. - I don't want to kiss your... - I love you. I don't want anything to do with you. Get off me! Get off... Okay, watch out. I'm not gonna do anything. ...me! I can't go through this anymore. I'm exhausted, sheerly exhausted. You're bigger than I am. You beat the shit out of me. I'm just tired. Oh, please. No, I can't. I can't. I can't go on anymore. Honestly, I can't. - Don't. - Please. - Don't go on anymore. - Please. - I'm getting... - Look, just relax, please. - Archie! Hurry! - Oh, gosh... - I'm about to enter... - You're mad! - ...the portals of hell! - Get off me! You're strangling me! Get up... - How can I get you... I can't even help you. - Let me get...

I'm almost choking! Get off. I'm gonna choke! - I can't help you. - Get off! All right, now, look. Can you help me up? Just push on my neck. Push on my neck. That's it! Now, I'll get you out if you'll help me. Now, just stay there. Don't move 'cause you're in a dangerous spot. Careful! Oh, God! You scream like a fishwife. Now, let me take you to a more comfortable spot. Oh, please, leave me alone. More comfortable, more comfortable. You'll love it. You'll love it. Please, just come over here. I can't work out of the light. I'm a dentist. - Now! - Oh, I think you're out of your tiny mind! Darling, I can't kiss you from here. It is physically impossible. Even your elbow is out of my reach. - Could you help me? - Pass it... - Could you help me? - ...my dear. All right then, I'm gonna get brutal. I'm gonna get like a maniac again! I'm gonna... You love it, don't you? Lookit! Lookit! You love it! You love it! You love it! I love it. It's about time. One kiss, one kiss. Just one kiss for my mother. Kiss me like my mother, will you? I've always been a mother-kisser! You like it? You know this one? I... I don't want to... See, I don't want to make it uncomfortable for you. That's what I'm thinking about. Not making it uncomfortable for you. I'm trying... If we could laugh... If you could laugh, you see, that would be better. That would be better if... See, I like to laugh like... It's... Laughing is good, you know. But we don't have to laugh. No, we could talk. You talk? If you talk, say what's on your mind... I'm a terrific listener. I'll listen to whatever you have to say. I'm sure there are things that you would like to tell me. Get it out. Could be broken English, I don't care. Don't do that! Don't... When I say don't, don't! What are you, making a sucker out of me? Come up in this room and lie down. Who are you kidding? What do you think, I'm a fool? I'm no fool. Come near you, and I suck wind! Make a sucker out of me. Talk to you, and you don't answer me. Who you kidding? You probably speak English. Speak Chinese, anything! Just say something! Lie there. Don't get up, you don't leave, just lie there. Terrific. Just lie there like a virgin. I want to go to bed. You lie there. I'm afraid to talk to you. I'm afraid you'll break, and you give me tongue. Order Coca-Cola, and then give me tongue. Boy, I can tell you were in the chorus. The way you kiss. Is that the way to kiss in Japan? Where you from? ls that where you're from? Japan? What's the difference? I'm an American. I'm from New York. You're Oriental, and I'm from New York. Order Coca-Cola, and then give me tongue. That's the part I don't get. Give me tongue and order Coca-Cola, I could understand that. What's the difference? Probably part of the tradition in your country. I don't know about that. I took a chance. All my life, guys have been telling me, "Archie, take a chance." Well, I took a chance. Tell me, "Let it out, let it out." Suck wind! Next time I let it out, it's gonna be in a sailboat. - In all the years I've been married... - I know. I know. I just... You know, it's goddamned strange. That's all. It's a strange thing. - What's so strange? - Well, I feel... I feel so goddamned disloyal. I feel like my heart is breaking. You're terrific. You're a wonderful girl. - Hello. - Hi, Mary. - Do you want a coffee? - Coffee, coffee, yes, coffee. Can we have two, please? Black or white? - White. - Two whites. This is my friend, Gus Demetri. I live around here. - Do I embarrass you? - Terribly. Oh, Gus, you're so laconic! Come on, wake up! Do something! Come on! - Do something? Jesus. - Look, move your feet or something. - They're too bruised. - Go on. And now your hands. And laugh. Now say something funny. Say something funny, so I can attack you. Go. Let's see. I hate aggressive women. - Come on, don't get sensitive on me. - All right. So, you don't like me. All right. - Just don't get sensitive, that's all. - I don't care anyway. I mean, who are you? You're nobody, are you? Just met you. Doesn't matter. I don't need you anyway. Gus, stop. - I know what it was. - What was it? Big Mary tired little Gussie out last night. Couldn't take the pace. No. Big Mary tired little Gussie out this morning, not last night. I hate your silly little white hands. Your silly, stupid, little white hands. I hate men with little white hands! - I have little white hands, but they're... - I hate yours especially! They're heavily marked. They're beautiful hands. They have beautiful signs in them.
