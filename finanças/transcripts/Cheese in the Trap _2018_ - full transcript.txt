Sorry. That's why you need to be careful. Park Hae Jin Oh Yeon Seo Park Ki Woong Yoo In Young Cheese In The Trap Seol? I ordered a fresh one. You didn't have to. Thanks. Let's work here tonight. You're prepared, so it shouldn't take long. His smile, his voice, his kindness What're you looking at? He's noticed by everyone. Thanks for walking me home. See you tomorrow. He treats me well, but I feel uncomfortable. I'm sure he has a side no one knows about. If he's kind to you, then enjoy it. But something feels wrong. Remember last semester? He's probably just being nicer now. Ooh! What if he likes you? Are you crazy? Hey! What's wrong with Seol? She's pretty, smart, and nice! But didn't you hear? There is a rumor that Yoo Jeong only dates celebs. Seol is as good as any celebrity! Hey! That's too far. Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hi. See you after class? What? Why? The assignment. We agreed to look at what we've done. Oh... yeah. See ya. Maybe I'm being too sensitive, but Sunbae Yoo Jeong is different from last year. The dubious senior suddenly turns Mr. Nice Guy Chapter 1: The Dubious Senior 1 year ago, an orientation party Seol! Did you apply for a dorm room? - Hey, Seol. - Hey, Eun Taek. I have to wait til next semester. The money I saved from work went to my family. But you commute 4 hours a day. It's okay. It's okay. Let's eat! Seol! You're back at school? Hey. Yeah. Hello Sunbae. It's good to see you! Eat up! Why's he so loud? His mouth is like a megaphone. Yoo Jeong! Come on! Hey! - Sorry, I'm late. - It's okay. Seol! This is Yoo Jeong! Have you met? We're in the same grade. - Ah... hello. - So... have you heard anything about work study? I should be asking you that, right? - I'll find out about it. - Okay. - Sunbae. Congratulations. - Thanks. We still have time. Yoo Jeong! Let me pour you a glass. I'm talking to Sang Cheol. Just one glass. Just one. Please, just one. - That's okay. - Just have one... - Are you okay? - I'm sorry. Hey! What's the matter with you?! We were talking! No, it's okay. Go clean up. Sorry. Really, I'm sorry. - Yoo Jeong, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm alright. Good. Isn't that... expensive? Jeez. He uses someone else's towel to wipe up a mess but his own for his hands? Is he really okay? Doesn't seem like it. I should take my time drinking. I drank. Do I report everything to you? Or to my father? Is it his girlfriend? I'm leaving soon. Are they fighting? More students are coming back. Are they talking about me? They're lame, like you guys. It's new. I'll give it to Bo Ra. Oh, you startled me! This is... Why? Don't be so sensitive about it. It's just uncomfortable. Do I need a reason? Can you be uncomfortable without one? I'm not uncomfortable. That... day... Never mind. Whatever! I'm just uncomfortable and awkward around Yoo Jeong. Yoo Jeong, did you offend Seol? She said she's uncomfortable around you. Weird. Why would she feel that way? Sorry. That's why you should be careful. This person who... Nice. I'll put it with the rest. Okay. Good work. - Seol? - Yeah? Want to go eat? Eat? Bon Appetit! Is this okay? I wanted to buy something delicious. This is fine. Tasty and easy. So you're uncomfortable around me? Not uncomfortable, just... I don't really know you yet. Really uncomfortable. I've never had one of these. Thanks for the food. I'll treat you to something better next time. N-Next... time? See you tomorrow. Don't rip it off. Go slow. The other side too. Wrap the rice carefully. Easy, right? You're leaving? When are you coming back? When I miss you. Stop crying. You're a grown ass man. Where are you going? Seoul. See ya! Chapter 2: Uninvited Guest Next, we'll finish up with the serum. Let's open it As you see, it's black, and contains fine glitter. This serum will help brighten up your skin tone. Also, this mask pack is soaked in luscious essence... Is this delivery guy crazy? Just put it down... Long time, no see... sis. Wow... great place. And this chair... But it's really messy in here for a woman... no, a human, right? If you leave food out, it'll rot, you idiot! I almost forget your face, then you show up at my door. Bummer. I gotta check in on you. Data Processing for Accounting Accounting? The president wants me certified so I can work at his company. A job? Funny, right? I laughed so hard he took my credit card away. Now he wants you to stop following him around like a loser, loser. You think he actually expects you to get a certification? It's just a way for him to get rid of you. What? You crazy jerk... You're just mad because he treats me like his own child. His own child? Hey. Do you still really believe that? You saw that I'm alive. Now, fuck off. I'm already getting sick of you. We were like puppies that Yoo Jeong's father got him. We served our purpose, and got thrown out. There are no more crumbs on his table! Find your own way to make a living! And stop chasing him like a dog! I told you to fuck off! Stop! Are you crazy?! Do you want to kill me? What? Are you going to hit me? Do it then! Just like old times! - You brat! - Hit me! Hit me! More! Hit me! You little psycho bitch! - You defy your aunt? - Huh?! Let go! Let go! You're not going to behave? Hit me again! You wicked brat! Who taught you manners? I should throw you in an orphanage! Are you not going to answer me? Hey! Answer me! - Mister! - What?! Mister, help us! Since our grandpa died, she's hit us every day! Look! She's gonna kill us! Please, take us away! Please! Alright. Come with me. This is my number. Call if you need anything. Crazy jerk... Thank you. Concentrate! Okay? $200. Where is he? It's unlike him to skip class. I have to get the assignment material from him. Yoo Jeong: I have the material. Come to the 3rd floor after class. Which way to the business administration department? So... handsome. Hey! Which way to business admin? I'm sorry! What the hell? Has he finally lost his mind? The train for Bonghwasan is now arriving. Thank you for using Seoul Metro. What's your relationship with Yoo Jeong? Who are you? Me? I'm... a friend. What's your relationship with Yoo Jeong? Why does this keep happening? Put a bell on people... Hey! I asked about Yoo Jeong It's nothing! I wanna talk to you. - Let go! - Let's talk! I said let go! Where are you going?! Don't ignore me! So... do you have human or dog hair? Anyway... is your family rich? They run a noodle shop in Uijeongbu. Then you're not dating Yoo Jeong. Are you ambidextrous? What? Oh... I used to use my left, but I broke it. So I started using my right. I see. Yoo Jeong did this. Sorry? Your surprise proves you don't know him that well. Transportation Costs $35. Phone Bill $65. Meal $150. Coffee $30. Misc. $100. Total $870. Still need $19 more. Hello, Seol. Yoo Jeong isn't friends with just anyone. No, he isn't. He's friendly to everyone but very picky about friends. Yoo Jeong, let's go eat. I already ate, but let's go tomorrow. Just eat more! And that's exactly what he's doing with me. Subaenim, hello... When we're alone, he ignores me. - Sunbaenim, hello! - Hello. But when others are around... Hello, Seol. "Hello, Seol." Hello, Seol. Voila! Wow... I practiced. What's the right reaction... Great job. I met a friend of yours yesterday. A friend? Yeah. Tall, sharp chin, well-defined features. He asked about my relationship with you. He's not a friend. If you meet him again, ignore him. Really? Why say that? There's no class tomorrow, right? Yeah. And part time workers have the day off too? How did he know that? - Shall we go to the movies? - Why? I mean... why you and me? Our assignment includes a movie. Oh, the art house movie... Damn, I can't think of an excuse. Want to go? Yes, Father. University Hospital You check into a hospital for slipping in the bathroom? You're still here? The guy I want doesn't come, the guy I don't does. You called Yoo Jeong? He answered? You seem alright. Yoo Jeong! The bathroom tile came loose. I tripped and fell. Ow! I really hurt my back. I can't move. When I check out, will you visit me? I knew it was a joke. What joke? I hurt myself. You didn't even call Father. Shouldn't you start with hello? He's cared for you since you were young, so call him. It's good manners. You're the asshole lecturing before saying hi. You refrain from calling Dad. Oh, the president adores me. He doesn't have time for your yapping. He doesn't? Well, that's all I know to do. So be nice to me about it. Because if you're not, you'll get burned. But you know that, right? Professor Baek was a prudent, respectable man. You two aren't much like your grandfather, huh? But you're like each other. Is that because you're siblings? We are siblings, idiot. Of course we're similar. He's mocking us, dumbass. Crazy asshole... Hey! Yoo Jeong! Hey! Hey! Yoo Jeong! Hey! Hey! Listen when I'm talking to you. You're both adults now. How much longer are you going to beg from us? Especially your sister. When are you going to stop mooching off us? So what the hell do we do? We were like your dogs, like your little toys. As a price for that, we're mooching off you. So what? You're not the victim, and we're just getting back what we gave. That's... just your level. Well, what're you going to do that your father adores my sister?? Adores? That's sweet. What? Once I start at the company, you'll no longer receive financial support. You have until then to figure something out. Also, quit lurking in my shadow. Lurking? Ah... dog hair. Why a dress... Student. Oh, damn! Did I scare you? Sorry. Room 905? Um... yeah, but... you can't be up here. It's a girls' dorm. Well, the security guard was gone. People might get the wrong idea. But thanks. You're welcome. You look pretty today. I'm tired because I think too much. I get headaches when I have to think 2 or 3 times about simple things. When a bunch of strangers live together, it happens. But won't it be worse once you start working? True. I tried to change, but it didn't work. A person can't really change. So now, I just try to adapt. Am I talking too much? No. I feel close to you when you tell me your thoughts. I like it. Are you okay? There... in that building... There's nothing there. I think this happened last year too. Last year? That's why you should be careful. Seol, I know you think I'm different from last year, but that was the past. I've changed. I don't know how you were, but last year, I - Let's talk about what will happen rather than what has. Seol, do you want to go out with me? What? Why that face? You knew, didn't you? I'm not... good at this. I'm too preoccupied. I see... Wait! I don't dislike you. Really? Then let's go out. Okay... What just happened? - Oh, damn! - What?! What's wrong?! What's with you? This the first time you've seen my facial mask? Did something happen? Did... Yoo Jeong say something? Yeah... What did he say? I thought you two were getting along. He wants to date. Holy shit! Oh! Holy shit! Everybody! Can we all sit together? You're keeping it secret, right? I didn't ask, but I think I should. Our Seol is finally dating someone! Seol! You gotta boyfriend? Why's his voice so loud? You're not exactly quiet. Hey! Yoo Jeong's here. Hey, hi. Oh, Yoo Jeong. Sit here. Don't come over... - Hello! - Hey, Kids, can I sit over here? Yoo Jeong! Don't sit next to Seol! She's got a boyfriend now!! I know. Really? How? It's me. I'm the boyfriend. What?! Yoo Jeong, is that true? So... where do you live? Cheongdam-dong Do you live alone? Yeah. Ah... you live by yourself. Siblings? An only child. You? I have a younger brother studying in America. What about you? Do you want to study abroad? My parents want me to graduate, get a job, and get married. They're old-fashioned like that. When's your birthday?! I ask a lot of questions, huh? Not on campus... What're we doing? I don't know. What're we... I don't know. Let's go study. Go... study? Yeah. ♫ The light went on. I got a signal ♫ ♫ I fell with a thud. Give my heart a hug now. ♫ ♫ My feeling is growing bigger and bigger ♫ ♫ I will show you ♫ ♫ Thump thump come closer and hold me tight ♫ ♫ I suspect your tone of voice, your gaze and your behavior ♫ ♫ Whether you are looking at me or thinking about something else ♫ Seol ♫ Maybe you feel just like me ♫ ♫ Everyday I looked forward all day ♫ ♫ I'm serious about everything, you tone of voice, your gaze, your behavior ♫ This one's not working. ♫ I fell with a thud.

I was confused. Why me? Does he even really like me? Confusing but... it feels good. I like it. Dunhill. Which kind? Original. If I say Dunhill, then I mean original. Here. I shouldn't even pay you, idiot. Chapter 3: The Stalker Sports Day, 1 year ago Move move move! If you don't get into the top 3, you're dead! Bo Ra, look. You're blocking my view. Why aren't you answering my calls? Why are you ignoring my feelings? Do you think you're a farmer or something? Women are cattle and you have to prod them? You're mad, huh? That's why I wasn't sure about you. Let's go talk somewhere. Don't! I just wanna talk. I said don't! I just wanna talk! Don't be such a bitch! Serves you right, Yeong Gon. I knew it. You little bastard! Shit! Did you see that? He's scared. He fell back, totally scared. Does he have anger issues or something? Maybe he's psycho? Hey! Shut up! Just... shut up! You think that's cool? Huh? Throwing basketballs at people's heads?! You dimwits! Get off me! Let's walk, Yeong Gon. I said get off! What, you're a nice guy now? Yeong Gon, knock it off! Shut up, you morons! You think he hangs out with you guys because he likes you? You throw yourselves at him, so he has to deal with you. He pities you! Friendly? Nice?! He's a total phony, and you can't even see it! So shut it! Sunbae... I... I'm sorry. I got angry and spoke out of line. But they wouldn't be quiet. Let's talk later. I'm sorry, Sunbae. I'm sorry, but I'm not the only one at fault. I got it. We'll talk later. Are you okay? You shouldn't have lashed out. That was your fault. Apologize to Bora when you see her. If you let your emotions take over, people get scared. Your ways can feel too aggressive to some girls. Here. I feel better when I eat sweets. Cheer up. I didn't know then that you should only comfort those who know how to accept it. Seol! Did you change your number? Why can't I reach you? Did you block me? I heard you're dating Yoo Jeong. I'm late for class. You don't have class first period. Let go! How'd you know about Yoo Jeong and about my class? It was easy. You're still doing that? Seol! You live in this area? So good to see you. What... are you doing here? My friend lives nearby. Come on, I'll walk you home. This is me. I'm going in. Really? You wanna get a beer first? No, sorry. It's late, and I'm tired. Bye! He'd hang around around her house and pretend to run into her. A total stalker. Oh Yeong Gon Thank you. What? Doing what? You - Don't ever raise your hand on a woman, asshole! Ah, shit! Who the hell are you? You got a lot of irons in the fire, don't you? I knew you were easy, but I didn't know you were cheap. Do I gotta knock your teeth out to shut you up?! Baek In Ho! Wait. There are many things I don't tolerate. Hitting women tops the list. What's wrong with you? Hong Seol, you watch yourself and think twice about Yoo Jeong. Think about what happened last year. This jerk's still flapping his lips! Why? Why? Why?! What?! What did he say? What happened last year? Something with you and Yoo Jeong? Mind your own business. I saved your ass! What? Blood! Blood! I'm bleeding! Yo, mop head! I'm hungry. Thanks! But I have no money to spend on you. That loser... looks like a dirty Q-tip. Bastard! What're you staring at?! Ah, it's Yoo Jeong. Been a while, Sunbae! Thought you were taking the year off? And miss all the fun here? Oh, I heard you're dating Seol. Congrats. Thanks. I'm surprised. I can be surprised, right? What do you want? Your taste is very unique. You were coaching me on how I can get her, then the next semester, you're dating her? Is that what you're into? What're you talking about? Don't play dumb. Shall I show Seol our texts? Suit yourself. You got balls! Worthy of your name! Well, let me show you something interesting. Seol was hanging out with some guy. Is she a little... easy? I'm not going to listen to this any more. See ya. Nice glasses. What's for lunch? Curry? Come with me. - Where? - It's a secret. News! Yeong Gon is dating Da Yeong! - Really? Da Yeong? - Yeah. That's good. You never know. It's Yeong Gon. Where are you going? Somewhere with Hong. You can't come. More news! Last night, 'Red Brick' struck again! It's dangerous without me. Whatever! Come on! Sunbae Eun Taek, have you eaten? - Me? - Yeah. - Not yet. - Want to grab a bite? - I... gotta go. - What? Come on. Great weather. Open the door wide. This suitcase is big. I knew you'd end up like this. He said if I get the certificate, he'll let me back in the condo. Then it's gone. Better start that studying. That's it. - Get dressed. - Why? We're going shopping. Hey... why are you going, and why do I have to come? How do you shop without a bag carrier? Try them on. I'm alright. Really. Don't be like that. I want to buy you something. These shoes are $200. Okay, then. We'll call it a gift for dating Yoo Jeong and your birthday. My birthday's not til... So pretty... Hey! Hello? Ring it up. Hey?! We saw them first! Find something else. They don't suit you. Can you believe her?! - Are you going to ring them up or what? - Give it! What're you doing?! What the hell?! I'm in a bad mood. So if you keep messing with me, I'll break all your bones. Got it? Hey! Hey! Let go! How about that, huh? Let's see... Hey. Oh! Shit! You... scared me! Why are you here? My dorm. Enjoy your food. I'm... I'm... sorry about earlier. Buy me a meal, and we'll call it even. Here. What's this? Apple bread. For you. Oh... well... Baek In Ho! Apple... juice... Did you not catch it on purpose? Are you drunk?! Do you not see my nose bleed? Every time we meet, I bleed! And you must compensate the victim, right? Ugh... fine, have it your way. But who was that woman before? My sister. Let's drink. Cheers! Campus is really dead tonight. Where's everybody? People aren't going out because of 'Red Brick'. 'Red brick'? Like... a red mask? When you look at me like that, I feel stupid. Stop making that face, and I'll stop looking. If I stop, will you dump Yoo Jeong and date me? You act out when drunk, huh? You little... There you are! Sunbae! What're you doing here? What're you doing here? I'm talking to her. I threw a juice box at him, and he got a nosebleed. Well done. Didn't I tell you no lurking? You can hear, right? Juice box? Nosebleed? You seem relaxed. Shouldn't you be finding a job? Since your sister's homeless now. You son of a bitch!! Oh... It's okay. You're not going to hit me? - I really wanted to sue your ass. - What? Finding all kinds of ways to take from people. But you're good at it, huh? You and your sister. You bastard! I asked you not to hang around. Yeah... That's right. The respectable Yoo Jeong and his demands. But what can you do? I'm not one to obey. Are you near the university because you want to play piano again? You're begging for a beating. I'll give you Professor Noh's number. I'll support you again too. Hey... you... how can you do that to me? Because I can. Aren't you sorry at all?! How about you? You jerks... are so noisy. Seol? Dog hair? Dog hair? You ass! These curls are natural. Scam artist... Seol, you're drunk. You quit too! Who finds fault in a person just to act self-righteous? Look! Here's a bottle! There are stones! Why only use words? Huh? Pansies... Just go. I'm not comfortable with you taking her home. You pay a lot of attention to someone else's girlfriends. Stop following me, In Ho. Know your boundaries. I heard he's gets money from Yoo Jeong's family! He acts rich, but he's really a charity case? Acting like he's something just because he plays piano. Is he Yoo Jeong's brother? - Total lie! - He pretended to be adopted! Yoo Jeong! It's a misunderstanding. I didn't want to say those things. You should know your boundaries. How could he do this? What's wrong? What's wrong? Yoo Jeong... you son of a bitch... Credit transactions stopped at customer's request. Yoo Jeong, you son of a bitch! You kicked me out, and now you're canceling my card?! Get certified then we'll talk. Bye. Hey... Seol: I'm sorry. Yoo Jeong: You hungry? Simple would have been fine. This is my hangover cure. Can... I ask about you and Baek In Ho? Why? I'm curious why you told me to ignore him and why he says you're the reason he hurt his hand. He said that? It wasn't me, but he won't listen to that. So I let him believe whatever he wants. That's your way? They're the grandchildren of a professor my father admired. When he died, my father took them in. Nice to meet you. We lived in the same house, like friends, like siblings. And then? Every relationship has intentions. If something happens at school, don't be confrontational. It just creates ripples. From the time I was a child, my father thought I was the one with a problem. He always thought I was odd. In Ho and In Ha, who reported to my father, were not my friends. Yoo Jeong. You thought I was your friend? The intention of the relationship... Yoo Jeong! Let me see your homework! Yoo Jeong, let's go eat! Where's... my wallet? Sorry, I was busy, so I didn't do our presentation. Always smiling, though the situations are bad. I'm perhaps the same. Sorry, Seol. I was sick yesterday. Seol, my computer isn't working. Here's our presentation script. Awesome! You rock! Thanks, Seol! Why did I consider him selfish? Thanks for driving me home. I was afraid to tell you. I thought you'd think I was odd. I think that's how most see me. We started off wrong. We considered each other strange and unpleasant, but really we're not. Because we were in a different relationship. Because of your difficult time, I didn't see that. I wonder... why did I grab his hand again the other day? Let's talk. No. Does Da Yeong know you're doing this? I tried to protect you. Yoo Jeong: Seol was nice to you. Yeong Gon. Right? What do I do? So? Do you still think I'm crazy? This is Yoo Jeong's true face! Seol! Hey! Give it back! Give it back! Let go! Let go of me! - Yoo Jeong: Send her a gift. - Yeong Gon: Don't know her address. - Yoo Jeong: Just follow her home. - Yeong Gon: What kind of present? Are you nuts? I'm trying to help her! You bastard! Are you that sick? Stalking, threatening, and now harassing? What did she do to you? All she asked was you leave her alone! You bitch! Come on! You think I'm afraid of assholes like you? You'll pay for this. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm okay. I'll meet Yeong Gon, talk to him in a way he understands. Okay. Words that became shackles, words that ask about the past. There was something I wanted to ask him. One Year Ago Advice? So unlike you. Let me see. I'm an expert on dating. Sunbae, it didn't work. I did what you said, and she accused me of stalking. What did I tell you to do? What? You... said I should just follow her home. I did? What's the matter with you? That's... what you told me! Yeong Gon, you idiot. I was joking. He's a total phony, and you can't even see it! So shut it! You fucking asshole! Seohan University Business Administration Department My name is Hong Seol. Should I wait in front of your dorm tonight? The party you have called is not available. After the beep... Don't call or text me! Delete What is it? I don't know. Someone's texting me weird stuff. A guy? Don't know. I'll be at your dorm tonight. What's this? What? What about me? 28 yrs old, 180cm What time? Meet at the gate? I'm getting similar texts. You too? Seohan University Sextagram Bora, Biz admin, Sex addict, Wants strangers, 010-6619-4719 Seol, Biz Admin... Holy shit! The IP address is... Mexico. Mexico? It'll take a long time to trace it. Ugh, it has to be Yeong Gon! When you catch him, call me at the number I gave you. Wait til we secure evidence. Don't worry. It's nothing too serious. Thanks for walking me home. I'll see you tomorrow. Try to get some rest. Yeah. Questions kept piling up. I should've asked right away. Did he really send those texts to Yeong Gon? How is he so calm in such circumstances? Seol. And why am I so disappointed by his rationality? Is she late because of the rain? Where are you? Oh, shit! She's not answering? No, but we agreed to meet here. It's late. Let's go back. I'll walk you. Bora! Bora... Seol... don't have strength... to walk... I'm so sorry. I should've been there. Luckily, no bones were broken. They want to watch her a few days, but she's okay. How can you be so calm? This could've happened to me. But you... how are you so calm? Emotion solves nothing. But I'm angry when my friend's hurt! When something unjust happens, I get upset! I can't be like you. - Do you know where Yeong Gon is? - No. Haha, not interested in him. Min Ji, where's Yeong Gon? - Call Yeong Gon - I really don't want to - Did Yeong Gon come to school today? - I think I saw him this morning. Has anyone seen Yeong Gon? Have you seen Yeong Gon? No, I haven't. - Guys, has anybody seen Yeong Gon? - Not me - Did he go to a PC cafe? - He wasn't in class today. If anyone sees Yeong Gon, text me. Have you seen Yeong Gon? No, I haven't. Seol! What're you doing? Hey. Wanna get some barbeque and beer? Next time. Well... Yeong Gon is buying. So, I just showed them. Hey! What's up? Looking for me? You piece of shit! Why'd you do that?! Do you know Bo Ra's hurt because of you?! Hey! Don't come in here shouting at him? Right? Just waltzes in yelling. Because of what you posted online! Hey! Stalking, harassing! They're crimes! Fuck off! What? You got proof? Can you prove it? That it was me? For any of those things? Let's say you can. So what?! It was a joke, okay? Why are you freaking out over a little joke? You little shit! I told you not to hit women! In Ho Wait... I dislocated my shoulder. I said I dislocated my shoulder! And I said don't hit women! Didn't I tell you? Not to hit women, huh?! It was once. Just once, okay? Just once... Huh? Huh? You piece of shit! I told you not to! Should I thank you? I didn't do it for you. You'll get out soon. I don't need your help. Who are you going to use this time? You never dirty your own hands, do you? That's how you technically didn't do this. Who you staring at, loser? Hard to look down on people from the floor, huh? You think I'll just let this go? You bastards! Yoo Jeong, what're you doing after class? Nothing. We found a cool new place. Do you want to come with us? Sure. What're you reading? Are you studying? OK! Let's fight! All the way! You fucker! Hey. He must be hurting. You think playing piano makes you superior? What if you can't play no more? No, no! Don't! Did you do this? You still don't get it? You did it. Don't blame others. I'm going away. - Bo Ra. - What? Just for a while. Abroad, maybe. What about me? Hey, I'm not dying. I'll be back. Yoo Jeong Introducing my girlfriend Idiots... You didn't go to the hospital? No, man. I'm like the phoenix. Besides, he wasn't that tough. Seol! Did you apologize to Yeong Gon? Why should I? Because you got him beat up by a gangster, who's apparently your friend. Hey, I'm alright! Really! Oh? There are two. Yours? Chapter 4: In Ha Yeong Gon! Who are you? You asshole! You call yourself a man?! Taking pictures of me sleeping, then posting them online?! My hair color! The mole near my ear! Who are you going to use this time? You never dirty your own hands, do you? Your glasses cam! Did you think I wouldn't find out?! I don't even know this woman! Why are you doing this to me? Oh, it's a joke. Why are you freaking out over a little joke? What're you doing here?
