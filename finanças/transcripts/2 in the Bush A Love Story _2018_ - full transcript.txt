Morning Kenneth! Do you wanna talk about it? No. You want some coffee? Where's it from? Um, I made it, I just made it over there... No, the beans, where are the beans from? Oh, I found a bag in the back of the cabinet, I thought... Where were the beans grown? Grown? Yes, sourced. Like, like Columbia? Like Columbia? Lesson for the day, Millions and millions of people die every year picking coffee beans. And they're never compensated for it. Yes. So, the bag that you found,your blood is on their hands. Or their blood is on your hands, either or, you're a murderer. It's a metaphor. Here's one that's not. Go sit down. It's not bad. Hey Claire, I'm so sorry, he's not available until the 28th. Yes, I received the script. I am printing it out right now. OK, great, talk soon. Claire called. She wants to know if you can shoot any earlier than the 28th. I told her you're booked but... Does Archimedes look depressed to you? I'm sorry? Archimedes. He seems... languid. Uh, languid? Yes, I'm concerned. Um, what do you want me to tell Claire? This is really bumming me out. I'm gonna take a walk. Um, OK. When will you be back? I don't know. Later. Uh, cause it's almost 2, and you have that meeting at 3... Emily, I really can't deal with this right now. My fish is sick. Honey, I'm home. I was able to get off work a little early today. So I stopped by that Chinese place you like. I thought we could both use a little treat. Kate? Peter: Oh shit. Peter! Peter, she's choking! Peter, help her! Peter: OK! Kate: Peter, save her! OK! Superhuman strength! I got it! I know the Heimlich! Come here! I know the Heimlich, stop! Emily: I'm not choking... Clear the airway! Clear the airway! OK, uh, Staying Alive, I don't know the song! Oh you're breathing. You're breathing! I saved your life. Get off. Look, we were gonna to tell you, we just didn't know how. How long? 3 months. And how many times? Look, that's, it's just not really important... It's 7. Peter. Actually, I think it's 8. Count the time with the vibrator, does that? I don't think that counts. Because I wasn't, I wasn't inside of her, it was the... Oh my god! Please shut up! I mean, how did this even happen? I thought that you were mostly gay, like 80%? I know, but maybe it's more like 70? 70? How? Kate: Sorry. Emily: And you! Peter, you were my best friend. I'm still your best friend, like, that doesn't have to change. OK, it's just, big deal, I like to have sex with your girlfriend every once and awhile. Oh, I'm gonna kill you! Emily, Emily! Guys, break it up! OK! I'm fine! I'm fine. I mean, I don't even know how I'm going to begin to forgive you. We're definitely going to couples' counseling, that's for sure... Emily, Emily, we're not going back to couples' counseling... Yeah, I know you don't think it works, but if you believe in it... No, I mean I want to be with Peter. And I don't want to be with you anymore. Oh. Kate: I think it's best if I stay with Peter tonight. Look I know this isn't the best time to talk about it, um, But my name is on the lease. I'm going to give you a few days to find a new place. And then Peter's going to move in here with me. Emily: You're kicking me out of my own life. I know. I'm so sorry. Hey. Um, I know, um, we haven't talked in a while but, I really, I really need you... right now, um, If you could give me a call when you get a chance... OK, bye. Why would you tell your mom that you wanted to put a kiddie pool on the roof? Why wouldn't I tell my mom? Remember, she was a huge asset in the whole venture. God, If I told my mom that, she would ask what kind of drugs I was on. My mom was the one that showed me how to roll up my first joint. I'm so jealous! Besides, how could you even forget that? I mean like, It was a poor college student's hot tub underneath the stars. With a killer view of the skyline. Indeed. I'm sorry. For what? For dropping out of your life. Well, you're here now,that's what matters. Rosa: That bitch! Excuse me? No, not you... Kate. I can't believe she did that to you! I knew it was coming. What? You knew he was, Oh! No, no. I never could have imagined that. We weren't happy. We hadn't been happy for a long time. She's still a bitch. True. Voilà. Here we go. Arroz con camarones, And kale salad. So you've been binge-watching cooking shows again? Only on weekends, girl who's got time? You know, this isn't so bad. Mm-hmm. I have you. Mm-hmm. I have this amazing meal. Right? At least I still have my job. Emily: What do you mean he cancelled? What exactly did he say when he, Um, Claire, I'm gonna have to call you back, sorry. Hey Kenneth, why did you cancel on Claire... I really can't talk right now Emily. What are you doing, you don't leave until the 28th. I'm flying out tonight. Where are you going? I'm going to Papua New Guinea. I've dreamt of doing this for years, I finally secured funding last night. It's going to be amazing Emily, people and places you can't begin to imagine. Um, wait, so you're shooting a documentary? Not just any documentary, I'm going to film throughout the entire country. From the shores of Port Moresby to deep inside the mountains and rainforests. I'm going to capture forgotten languages, cultures untouched by the modern world. This is going to be one of the most authentic and important stories ever told. OK. All right, cool. Um, OK, well I'll just need a couple of days to get everything together. I can just meet you there. Um, shit I gotta get my passport. Do they have a vaccine for malaria? What are you talking about? You're not going. I'm not? No, what would you even do there? Update my calendar while I spear fish? I could help. I could, I could shoot, I could... Don't be ridiculous, you're not a filmmaker. Well I want to be, that's why I took this job. Kenneth: Do you? What's your story? Until you have a story that burns so bright inside of you, that it feels like it's going to consume you, if you don't get it out, You are not a filmmaker. You see, Emily, this is my dream. You go find yours. Um, so what's gonna happen to the company? I am shutting this place down. You can go home if you want. I'll pay you to the end of the week. That's fair, right? Woah, what are you doing? I'm taking him. Archimedes? You can't! Yes, I can. He's more mine than yours anyway. I feed him, I take care of him. You just show up. You're a bad fish-dad! And your first documentary? It was overrated. How dare you. I'll come back for everything else later. Goodbye friend. And Emily. Rosa: Hello? Emily: Hey. How you doing in there? Good. Yeah? Uh huh. Are you sure? Not really. Can I come in? Yeah. Hey. What's wrong? I'm a loser. No, you're not. I lost my job, today. And I lost my girlfriend, and my apartment. So, by definition, I am a fucking loser. Well, you still got me, eh? That's a lot. It's a hundred and eighty pounds of awesome, and everything! Emily: What are you doing! Give me your foot. No, don't, don't, don't! Hello? Rosa: Hello? Can I please have a new life? Why are you adding cilantro? You need to balance the acidity! Ever heard of it? God, it's simple. Oh you're just now searing the scallops? Nobody likes quinoa! It's so hot in here. Which of these fonts do you think best represents me? Um, That one. Really? Yeah, definitely, mm-hmm. OK, now, which shade of white do you think best represents me? What the fuck? Come on. Yes! Rosa: I smell something cooking... Perfect timing! I just finished making dinner. Oooh, I love breakfast for dinner! Hey, Emily: Voilà. How'd you get them to be so pink? Puréed beets baby. Rosa: Mmmm. You getting that? Oh yeah. Oh man, this is good. Um, well as much as I support your culinary explorations... Thank you. I think we need to talk about this. Talk about what? I think you're falling down the rabbit hole of cooking shows. Yeah. No, I'm serious. Hey, trust me, I've been there all right? It's starts off like this, first you're watching a couple episodes, and then BAM! You're making complete 7 course meals with wine pairings for your cat. You don't have a cat. That's not the point! The point is, even though your dick-shaped pancakes are amazing, they're really good. I think they're a cry for help, and I'm here to help. They're supposed to be hearts. Really? I guess I, I'm just not used to having this much time on my hands. Well, see, OK, right there, that's why I'm here to help, OK? I found you a job. You found me a job? Rosa: Mm-hmm. What? What is it? Uh, It's for a friend of mine, she needs a personal assistant. OK, I can do that. Rosa: Yep! Um, what kind of assisting? Well... it's uh... it's a little unconventional really. Nikki: Just one more minute. Oh, take your time! I am so sorry for the wait. It's, it's totally cool. No worries. I just had to get ready for my next appointment. Thank you so much for squeezing me... in. So, how much did Rosa tell you about the job? Not enough. I'm sorry? Uh, just that you need an assistant, for your business. Well, that's true. Oh, uh, here's my resume. Wow, you have a lot of experience. Yes, I am very good at assisting. Mm-hmm. Well the job is pretty simple. You just need to keep the space stocked, uh, answer some emails. Book appointments, update the calendar, and then there's some light laundry and cleaning. Great. I can do that. So, how much do you know about BDSM? Um, I'm not, I'm not sure. Are you familiar with CBT? NT? GS? AW? FF? Pegging? Oh! Yes! Pegging, I know that one, I know that one. OK, good. I can teach you the rest. Great. So if you don't know anything about BDSM, why would you wanna work here? Well I am, uh, a very hard worker. Um, I am never late. I, Uh, to be honest, I just really need a job. Can you be discreet? Discreet is my middle name. Actually, it's Agnes. So what's your tolerance for weird, Emily Agnes? This chest of drawers is full of toys, and they need to be washed after every use. May I? That's a cock cage. Oh. Yeah, I had a guy wear it for a week once. A whole week? These especially need to be cleaned after every use. Emily: Wow. Especially this one. It's very popular. A two-hander. Nikki: Yeah, it won't bite. Wow. Nikki: Yeah, mm-hmm. Support the head. OK, that's fine. So this is the area for medical play. Oh, is there a dungeon dog? A punishment puppy? That's a chuck. His name's Chuck? That's so cute, I love people names for dogs... Emily, there is no dog. Oh, oh. OK, yeah. OK. And this is the office where you'll be spending most of your time. Thank you. I really appreciate this. Well just let me know if you need anything or have any questions. I will. Great. Hey! Hey, how'd it go? Come here you, how was it? It was interesting. Yeah, yeah, and Nikki, did you love Nikki? Isn't she cool? And sexy as fuck? Just wish I could be her for like a day, right? She's amazing. She is really cool. Yeah, I'm so glad. What are you doing? You had a good day, you had such a great day. Emily: What? What is this for? Oh, you're gonna need hugs, lots of hugs. Why? Um... Kate dropped some stuff off for you today. Some boxes. Hey, you don't have to open them right now, OK? They'll be there when you're ready. So will I. Hello, I have an appointment. Oh, right. Lady Violet. I have you down, uh, for 2 hours. Excellent. Nikki told me me you were a little new to all of this? Yeah, a little. Well, I just wanted to let you know, my client's a screamer. No problem. Screamer? Hey. Hi. I'm Ben. Emily. Um, Nikki sent me to fix the toilet. Oh. Oh, oh. Uh, thank God. Um, here, it's right this way. Here's your problem. Is that a butt plug? Yep. In the toilet? It happens more often than you'd think. So, where would you like me to put this? I'll go get a garbage bag. Cool. Oh here, let me help you. What are you doing in here? You are not supposed to be in here when someone has the space booked. I'm sorry, I, I heard a loud noise. I was worried. It's just this stupid swing. You can go home. But just let... But what? I said go home. Is everything OK? It's just been a really shitty day. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have taken it out on you. You wanna talk about it? No, I wanna drink about it. A Bloody Mary? At night? That's when they taste the best. Can I ask what happened? It's just this client I've been seeing for awhile. He's into forced femme, and we usually have a pretty good time but, I don't know, I guess I should've seen it coming. What did he do? Lately he's been getting more and more attached, too attached and, He told me he loves me. I know. Of course he doesn't love me, he doesn't know anything about me but... What he loves is this idea of me, this persona. And today he asked for my real name. But you didn't give it to him, did you? No, but when I refused, he said he knows what my car looks like. And that he could copy down the license plate number and take it to a private investigator. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I mean, I can't go to the cops or anything. I guess I could call his wife or his work. But I don't know how serious he was being or if he was just trying to scare me. Why would he be trying to scare you? I mean, isn't he paying you to be in control? That's just the thing. These guys, they like to be dressed up and humiliated... But they still want some kind of control, some kind of power over you. Does this kind of thing happen a lot? It used to. Back when I worked at this commercial dungeon. The other dommes and I jokingly called it "the factory"... It was like the fast food of the S and M world, and we were the fry cooks of cock and ball torture. It was always, how many guys can you see and how much can you get them to pay? The owners were these really shady dudes, and if you wanted to quit, They would threaten to tell your family, your school, your 9-5 gig. Anything to keep you scared and willing to put up with their shit. I'm so sorry. Don't be. It's the reason I decided to start my own space. I wanted to give myself and my friends the ability to manage ourselves and pick our own clients. I'm not anybody's boss, they just rent from me, but it's still my space. And it wasn't easy, it took time, it took sacrifice, but I did it. And I won't let anyone take it away from me. You know, you're kind of my hero. Shut up. I'm serious, it's inspiring. Stop it, you'll make me blush. Oh, I love this song. You wanna dance? My lady? Oooh, such a gentleman. I don't know how to dance, I just wanted to... You just wanted to try? Emily: Yeah. Good job. Thank you. For what? For being nice to me. You should take a shower, you have sex hair. Oh my god, you have sex hair! What happened? Tell me everything! Tell me everything! Wait, wait, wait! Who was it? Was it a guy or a girl? Tell me! You know you really fucked up. I did? I mean... I did. You shouldn't have left before breakfast. I'm sorry, how can I make it up to you? Hmm, I'm sure you'll think of something. What are you doing tonight? I don't have plans, but you do. I do? Booked you for a double with Mistress Snow. Tomorrow? It's a date. No kissing in the dungeon. Put this away. Don't look at me. Hey, are you busy? Um, not really. Great, do you want to make 100 bucks? Um, sure. OK, in 5 minutes, I want you to just walk through that room, and start just laughing. Um, that's all I have to do? I'm in. See? Even she thinks your tiny dick is hilarious. Did I tell you to fucking stop? Make that little dick twirl. Make it twirl bitch! Make that fucking dick twirl bitch! Hey, butt plug guy! Please don't ever call me that again. Emily: Sorry. I'm actually here in my other professional capacity. Oh, and what's that? I just finished this painting for Nikki. I was hoping I can hang it up for her. Yeah, of course. Is the space available? Maybe give it another 20 minutes. Hmm, now a little bit... I think that's good. OK. Wow, that is really beautiful. Thank you. What is it? It's a man having sex with a duck. Hmm. I'm just kidding, it's whatever you want it to be. Well, it's definitely not a man having sex with a duck. A goose? Maybe. A consenting goose. "A Consenting Goose". I think you've just given it a title. Would you like to grab a cup of coffee with me? Uh, I prefer tea. Tea, then? No. No? I just, I have to be here for another, um, for another 2 hours so... Well then in 2 hours you should meet me at the corner. Why? It'll be an adventure? Um, sure. So what did you want to be when you grew up? A firetruck. I'm serious. Did you always know you wanted to be a painter? I always knew I had something in me that wanted to get out. Painting was just the form it happened to take. Cool. What about you? What do you want to be when you grow up? Well I thought I wanted to be a documentarian. Wanted to be? Yeah, I, I did everything I was supposed to do. I went to school, got a job working for an award-winning documentary filmmaker. So what happened? A series of disappointments. I see. So what are you gonna do now? I don't know... I'm still trying to figure that out. Well, do you still want to be a documentary filmmaker? Yes, but it's not that easy. Why not? You need money, and equipment, and people who believe in you. I believe in you. You barely know me. I know enough. I should, I should probably get inside. Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much for today. It was the most fun that I've had in a really long time, and I really needed it. It's been my pleasure. OK. OK, I'm gonna go. Ben: OK. All right. Bye. See ya. See ya later. Bye. Bye. So I met a guy, Mm-hmm. Do we like this guy? Like, wanna see him naked, like him? Hmm... interesting. Who's the guy? What's his name? Do I know him? His name's Ben, he's a painter, and he does odd jobs around the dungeon. Oh I know Ben. Emily: Yeah? Yeah, nice guy, and you should want to see him naked. Emily: Right? It's just kind of complicated. I should say so, I didn't know you were into that kind of thing. Why wouldn't I be? Just cause I was dating a woman for 3 years doesn't mean I'm not still bisexual. No, I know you're bisexual, I'm talking about Nikki. What about Nikki? I know, what am I going to do about Nikki? I have feelings for her too. Wait, how do you know about Nikki? Everyone knows. Everyone? Yeah, it's not like it's a secret. What's wrong? Um, no, I just, um, I thought she would talk to me before we started telling people. It's, it's cool. Oh shit. Oh shit, you don't know. Emily: What? I don't know what? What are you talking about? Ben and Nikki. They're, they're together. They're a couple. Like, partners. Emily: Oh shit. Rosa: Shit. Oh, shit. Oh shit. Nikki: We need to talk. I am so, so, so sorry. I had no idea that you and Ben were a couple. And I never would have done anything if I knew, but, not that anything happened... It's my fault. Come again? Actually, it's both our faults. I guess I'm just so used to everybody knowing that Ben and I are open. Open? In an open relationship. We see other people. Oh. It's just normally we pursue outside relationships separately, you know, individually of each other, but, He met you, and then I met you, and we were both interested, and, We, we weren't trying to trick you or manipulate you or anything like that. It's just, we didn't have a chance to talk about it until last night. Um, uh, no that's, that's cool. I get it. Kind of. It's just after you and I slept together, I should have said that I was in an open relationship and I'm really sorry. No, no. It's, it's cool. Um, Ben and I were talking and, um, we both really like you. And we want to pursue a relationship with you. The 3 of us, like, the 3 of us? Like... Yeah, that, or you could date us individually, or you could date just one of us and the other would be supportive. You know, I'm sorry, um... I think that I might be a little too traditional for that. And that's OK too. OK. Thank you, for being so understanding. Yeah... no problem. I'll just leave you to that. What up mopey pants? I don't know how to date. What are you talking about, of course you do. The world has changed Rosa. I mean, back when I was dating, we were in college. I was the wild one. Bisexual. Dating guys and girls interchangeably. But now, people are experimenting with sadomasochism, and polyamory, and, I don't know, I just feel like I'm boring. Oh, honey you are anything but boring. Here, I'll help you. Give me your phone. Give me your phone. What are you gonna do? Gimme. Ugh, stop, dating app? No, I don't want that... Hey, how do you expect to get back on the horse if you don't ride a few first? That literally makes no sense. Doesn't matter. OK, what matters is that you need to get back out there, OK? Have a little fun, make a few mistakes. Fuck your way to emotional stability. That sounds like a terrible idea. Well, at least it's not boring. Have fun. What's that? Ugh! God, it's a penis. Ugh! God damn it! What's up? This dating app. I mean, do guys really think that a woman will have sex with them if they send them a photo of their penis? Is there anything in the photo that shows scale? No. Then absolutely not. Here, you're gonna need it. Thank you. Hey, what's a unicorn? Rosa: Look it up! Unicorn, Oh shit. Bartender: Bloody Mary and rum and coke. Thank you. So Emily, good to finally meet you. Yeah, it's good to meet you too. You look just like your picture. Oh, you too, I'm really glad you're not fat. Can I ask you something? Ask away. How would you describe the sky to a blind person? This might sound unusual, but do you shave or wax? Uh, I just have really sensitive skin so I need to ask. Do you want to hear one of my poems? I'd love to. I call it, your vagina makes me hungry. You ever been slapped in the face? Like, really hard? No. Me neither. Your tongue, like velveteen. Tu cuerpo, tus labios, tengo hambre. The sky is, is blue. I don't know what blue looks like. It's just your skin is so... precious. Emily: Thank you. Oh, you used to be fat, so you probably got low self-esteem. That's perfect! I just always wondered what it would be like to, to, to be blind. Emily: Yeah, uh. You, you resisting, the, the poem? Did it? Emily: Oh no, no, no. Oh, um. I'm like, so glad I met you tonight. I'm so glad I met you. Oh, yeah, it's my boyfriend, hang on just a sec. Hey boo. Ainsley, are you sure that you don't want anything besides water? I'm trying to be better about not using alcohol to have sex or to lessen my inhibitions. Plus I don't turn 21 for another 3 weeks so, don't worry about it. So Adam... Actually, it's pronounced Atom. Oh, Adam. No, Atom. Like, like A-T-O-M. You know how an atom is like, like a fundamental part of everything? That's me. Fundamental. I don't, don't really know what that means. Well, I mean it's all really in the title. Your vagina makes me hungry? Yeah. So you're in marketing? No, now I'm in dog poo. I'm sorry, what? Dog poo. Like, artisanal, organic dog shampoo. Me? Oh, nothing much, just hanging out with the girls. Wanna meet up later? Give me like, an hour. Maybe two. Maybe I need to like, go out with a blind person. I don't know. So many people won't date you until you can legally drink in a bar. It's like, serious ageism. Do you like being slapped in the face? Not the face. This'll probably be my last one. I think then I might have to go... home. Small bill then. Do you wanna split it? Maybe? I've always thought that I was an old soul. And you know when I talked to you, I felt like the ages of our souls matched up. Can, can somebody like... it's fine... You know what, I'll get you, I'll get you another one. Atom: Yeah, OK! You know, she's busy, so I'll just, I'll be right back... Atom: Busy? It's dead in here. Is this your room? Yeah, it's mine. God, you have great boobs. Thank you. Oh, seriously. You have like, the best boobs. Seriously, thank you. Hey, how do you feel about porn? Um, what? Like, do you want me to put some porn on? No, that's, that's OK. OK, cool. What was that? Oh, that's Artemis. Who's Artemis? My cat. Emily: Oh. Are you sure you don't want to go check on her? Shush, it's just a hairball. Am I your uncle baby? Am I your uncle? Are you my uncle? Atom: Mm-hmm. Am I your uncle? Tell me I'm your uncle. I need you to call me Uncle Jerry. OK. Uncle Jerry? That doesn't, that sounds really bad. Do, do you wanna go check on her? I can wait... No, no, no, that's not Artemis. Who is it then? It's Gaia, my other cat. Oh, um, how many um, how many cats do you have? Four. Oh yeah! Mmm. Ahhh. Oh my nose! Oh my god! I am so sorry! Could you go get something for me please? OK, um, I'll go get something! I'm going to ruin this fucking dress. Fuck this. The good news is, I don't think it's broken. I think you should go. Again, I really... Mmm. Eh. Shit. Ainsley: Athena! So what you're saying is, you got more pussy than you asked for. Oh come on, it wasn't that bad. OK, it was bad. I just keep thinking of how easy it was with Ben and Nikki. You know? Yeah, but they're a couple. I thought you weren't into that kind of thing. Unless... you're thinking about it aren't you? Emily: No, no I'm not. Oh my God, yes you are! You're totally thinking about it! Oh my God. OK, maybe a little. Oooh, I knew it. So, um, what? Are you gonna date them, as a couple, together? No, but I was thinking maybe like, separately? At least at first. Oh, you do realize you're gonna have to tell me everything that happens, right? Emily: Yeah, mm-hmm. Every single thing. Especially when it comes to sex, right? The threesomes, and the sex swings, and are you into spanking? Emily: All right I'm walking away now. I'm walking away now! Oh my God, I'm so proud of you! Look at you embracing bisexuality, and kink, and non-monogamy! My baby's so grown up! Celebrations! So, I've given it some thought, And I would like to try to date, both of you. Individually. We would love to. Great. So, how does this work? Well, first I think we should start off with some ground rules. Rules? Just two really. OK, what are they? Nikki: The first rule is, if anyone feels jealous or uncomfortable. We talk about it. These feelings are normal, and there are no judgements. Ben: The second is the acknowledgement that there are three relationships here. One between you and Nikki. One between you and I. And one between Nikki and I. Each of those relationships deserve respect. If anyone feels like they can't do that, we go back to rule number 1. We talk about it. Wow. Is it what you expected? Pretty much. Well I just need to grab something before we go. OK. How long have you lived here? Uh, a couple years. Why don't you live with Nikki? Sorry. I probably shouldn't ask that. No, it's OK. It's just... well, it's complicated. I understand. Ah! For me? Ben: Mm-hmm. Thank you. It's not the best camera, but I thought at least it's a start. I can't accept this. No, don't think of it as a gift. Think of it as an investment. I do. Besides, everyone needs someone to believe in them. What about the concert? Fuck the concert. Rosa: Wow. Best thing a guy ever got me was a mixtape. Mixtape? Oh, he was very into analogue. God. Just feels wrong. What does? Feeling this happy? What? Why would that feel wrong? Because it's two different people making me this happy. Girl, you need to let that shit go. Look, just because you haven't read this in a book, or seen it in a movie to tell you it's right, doesn't mean it's wrong. OK? Only you know what's right for you. Thank you. You're welcome. I think I really needed to hear that. Rosa: Mm-hmm. Besides, what does society know anyway? What's that saying? One in the hand? Beats two in the bush? Rosa: Exactly. I think I would disagree with that. Of course you would. I'm trying to be deep here... I am deep! Nikki: Nice camera. He told you? Mm-hmm. OK. So, I have this idea. You could totally say no, but, Uh, I wanna make a little documentary. Um, like about you and your space. OK. It, it's, it's only going to be a couple minutes long, Um, you don't have to use your real name, or we can change it, Or you can use your dominatrix name if you want to, If you wanna blur your face we can totally do that... We don't have to use the name of the space, unless you're into that, You can put it on your website, We actually don't really need to show it to anybody, Maybe it could be like, very avant garde, you know? And uh, um, I just, I really just wanna get some practice. And, again, you can, you can totally say no. Yes. Really? Of course. I trust you. And it would be really nice to have some video for the website. Thank you. Of course. OK, don't mind if I do. Am I to be the subject of your next documentary? No, I'm just practicing. I'm shooting Nikki at the dungeon tomorrow. Oh. Oooh, yeah, right there. That's the shot. I hate being on camera. Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. You hate being on camera? It's so, it's so bad? OK. I think we got it. Really? I don't know that I was excited enough. You were plenty excited, I could definitely see that. Nikki, um, could we do a little CBT? Sure Bob. Oh good. So you're sure you've got everything you need? Definitely. Great. How's it coming? Get it? Coming? It's coming along fine. Thank you for asking. I'm so good. You're dumb. So, what do you think? I think it's very artistic. What do you mean, artistic? No, I mean, I love it. I think it's perfect for the website. You know you don't, you don't have to like it. I know, but I do. But, I just don't think that this is the documentary you had described to me earlier. How so? I think that this is what you thought I wanted for the website, rather than what I think you wanted for yourself. Does that make sense? Yes. You are very wise. That's what they pay me the big bucks for. Come here. Do not be discouraged. OK. I'm sorry, wait, just one more time. You should just take this back. I'm sorry, I must have lost the receipt. I'm serious. I'm no good at this. Please, take it before I do more damage to the name of cinema. Well, if you insist. Hey! Look, you're going to fuck up sometimes. That's just the way it goes. You can't let that stop you. Not if you really want this. Now, do you want this? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Cause I mean, it can be mine. Emily: No! I mean, I can even name it. Now the secret to a great paella, is in the stock. You've got to start with the ickiest bits you can find. Have I ever told you I have a thing for women who fondle disembodied heads? No, but I can see why. Thank you for making me dinner. I'm sure you'll find a way to make it up to me. Oh, I could think of so many ways. Oh, I'm gonna wash these first. Yes, please. So, I'm throwing a party next weekend. Actually, it's a fundraiser. Oh yeah? For what? Sex Workers United. Oh, is that like a dominatrix thing? Sort of. They provide legal and social services for current and former sex workers. So it's not just dommes, but escorts, porn actors, strippers. That's awesome. I was wondering if you would like to come. I would love to. There's just one thing. What's up? Ben is donating some of his art to the silent auction. Um, would you be OK if he came as well? I, I totally understand if that's too weird for you, but it'd be really important for me to have both of you there. But you totally don't have to. I want to. Really? I wouldn't miss it for the world. Clean hands. Nikki: Oooh, yay! Thank you. I promise. Nikki: Not so fishy anymore. Holy shit. I know, right? Nikki knows how to throw one hell of a party. Let's go get some drinks. Ben: Hey! Hey! Hi! How are you? Good. How are you? Oh, you remember Rosa? Of course I do, how are you? Great, great. Thank you. I'd be even better if I had what they were having. Here, I want to show you something. Emily: Oh that's right, Nikki said you donated some of your paintings. Ben: Yeah, I try to do it every year. How many years have you been doing it? I don't know, like, 3 or 4? I really love your use of negative space here. Really? Rosa: Yeah. Thank you. Rosa: You're welcome. I have no idea what that means but artists love it when I say that. So where's Nikki? Oh you know, making the rounds. She's in full hostess mode. Oooh, let's go dance, yeah. Rosa: No, but don't dance like that. Good evening you fine and fabulous people. I just heard that we have reached our fundraising goal! A toast to everyone who helped make this such a great success. Thank you so much, you fucking rock! Let's party! I'm so glad you could make it! Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss it. It's the event of the year! Hi. Emily: Hi. You know how I said before that you're kind of my hero? Yeah? You are most definitely my hero. Shut up. Well I couldn't have done it without such talented and generous donors. Come here. OK. I really feel like the 4th wheel here, so I'm gonna go dance. Grace: Nikki! Grace, hi! Hello. Ben, always a pleasure. Good to see you too David. We are so impressed with everything you've done here. Well thank you. A truly spectacular night. You really outdid yourselves. Oh, no, it was all Nikki. I just paint. Oh, don't you just love them? David and I were just talking about how you two are our favorite couple. Nikki: Well, I don't know about that. No, seriously, you guys are the best. So creative, so supportive of one another. I mean, how long have you guys been together? It's been forever hasn't it? Yeah, when you gonna finally make an honest woman outta her? Yeah, that's not horribly offensive. Have you seen the paintings that Ben did? Yeah, we just... Hey you know what? Let's go look at them again. Come on, it'll be great, let's go. She really threw herself on that grenade. Yeah, I'm trying to figure out when we first met them. I think we shared a tent in Bali. You guys went to Bali? Yeah. A couple of years ago. We went with a group of people. Cool. Yeah, it was pretty awesome. Are you OK? Of course. I was just thinking about how special you are to me. You're special to me too. I'm gonna get a refill, do you want anything? I'm good. OK, cool. Hi. Hey. Is this the first one of these you've been to? Yeah. It's pretty great. How do you know Nikki? Um, it's kind of a long story, but I guess she's kind of my girlfriend. Oh, really? Emily: Mm-hmm. So you know about her and Ben? Uh, yeah. I'm dating him too. How funny. I guess they weren't as into sharing when I was dating her. You dated Nikki. Yes, but just for a little bit in my 20s. Back when I was wild and crazy. But I guess I wasn't girlfriend material. Let's be honest though, that was never gonna work. Um, why's that? Oh you know, the whole love triangle thing. It's fun for a little bit, and the sex is great, but that kind of thing never lasts. Somebody gets jealous, and God, I mean, how the hell do you figure out the holidays? Um, guess I never really thought that far ahead. Yeah, well, fortunately I got out before things got too serious. Then I met my husband and it was just so much easier to do all those big, grown-up things, you know? Buy a condo, adopt a dog, get married, babies. Yeah, um, I don't really know if I want all of those things, so. You will, just gotta get this out of your system first. Everything OK? Yeah, let's dance. Are you eating all my kale again? Maybe. Nikki: 5 years of my life. Another potato? You want another potato? May I? Nikki: You may. Sure I can't help with anything? Nikki: Oh no. We've got this. You just relax and enjoy. You're in for a treat. Nikki makes the best breakfast potatoes. Yeah, but they can't hold a candle to your eggs. Here, try one. Good? Mm-hmm. It's perfect. Potato kiss. Yeah, I like it. I can't do this. Nikki: Do what? Have breakfast? Ben: Do you want me to make something else? No, um, I can't, I can't, I can't do this. This. What's this about? Is this about last night? No, it's not, it's not just about last night. Nikki: Then where is this coming from? Look, you guys have been a couple for a really long time. Way before, way before me. Nikki: What does that have to do with anything? Look, the food's almost ready. Let's just sit down and talk about this. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. OK, well we're in a relationship so you're going to have to talk about it. Yeah, those are the rules. Fuck the rules. What do they even mean anyway? How do they even fucking work in real life? No, what, what is this about? Why are you acting like this? I just finally see what I am to you. And what is that? Just another one of your toys. I'm just some toy for you to play with. Until you get bored, and then just gonna throw me away. How can you say that? You know us. I don't, I don't know, I don't know anything. You do, please, let's just calm down. I'm afraid someone's gonna say something they'll later regret. Don't you know how much we care about you? How much you mean to us? All I know is that this is never going to work. Emily please, we need you to be able to talk to us, we want this to work... Will you stop saying that? We? We? God, don't you see? You guys have been a "we" for so long. And then I'm... I'm always gonna be on the outside. Emily, that is not true. Isn't it though? I mean... it's only a matter of time before this blows up in our faces. You should be thanking me for saving us all the trouble. You know what? No. Nikki. No, I'm not gonna let you do this. It's already done. You know what? Ever since you broke up with your ex you've been hiding. You hide at Rosa's, you hide at the dungeon. When was the last time you sent out your resume? Or looked for an apartment for yourself? You don't have the right... Yes! I do have the right. What are you trying to do here? What are you waiting for? Are you scared? Are you so scared that you're not even willing to give this a shot? You have to be willing to fight for things, to fuck up, to fail, to get hurt. Emily: Shut up. Please shut up. No, you have to make a decision Emily. Are you gonna give us, give this a real shot? Or are you gonna walk out that door, and give up on everything before we've even had a chance to try. Oh, hey. I didn't expect you home so early. It's noon. Anyway, this is, um, What was your name again? Guy? Rosa: Guy! Such a strong, masculine name. How could I forget? You're so... this is Guy, Emily. Hi Guy. Hi. Guy was just leaving. I was? You were! We had a great time though. Wasn't it fun? We had a fun time, we'll do it again sometime, yeah? Yeah. But you'll call me, right? Oh, definitely. For sure. Yes. Absolutely. Guy: Really? Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah, thanks a lot! What's wrong? Tell me. Just sign here, and here. Thank you again Claire. No thanks needed. You know I always thought that your talents were wasted on Kenneth. Have you heard from him lately? Um, no. I thought he was still in Papua New Guinea. He's back now. I heard he contracted malaria and had to be flown out of there. Lost over a month of shooting time. I'm sorry to hear that. Hmm, yeah, his investors are pissed... But he seems to think he'll be able to shore up enough funds to go back there next year. Well I hope it works out for him. I know it was really important to him, so. Welcome to the team Emily. How does the title, Associate Producer sound? It sounds great. OK, last page, right? And then it's official? Claire: Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh, hi. My name is Emily. I was wondering if there was somebody that I could get in touch with in regards to a documentary I'm making? OK, great. Thank you so much. Bye. Oh, gross! Rosa: Oh Daddy. Guy: Oh Daddy. Rosa: You like it when I call you Daddy. That one time. So, what do you think? I'm so fucking proud of you. For real? Yes! Do you wanna watch it again? Yes! Yes! So, you thinking of inviting Nikki and Ben? I don't know. Do you think I should? I think it's up to you. I don't know if they would even want to come though, you know? I know I wouldn't want to speak to me ever again. Well, there's only one way to find out. Go ahead. Rosa: Just take deep breaths, you're gonna be fine. Rosa: Hey, welcome. Hi Emily: Hi. Emily: God, I am so nervous. Rosa: I know you're nervous. Emily: Hi. Thank you for... Rosa: Coming, coming, coming. Emily: Yes, thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Rosa: Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming. Rosa: Yes, you'll be fine. Rosa: Welcome. Thank you for coming. Emily: Hi, thank you for coming. Rosa: Hi, welcome. See, look at all the people who got tickets. Emily: Hi. I got to..I, Ready? OK, come on. Uh, I want to thank you all for coming. It, it really means so much to me that you're here. Uh, this short film is the first chapter in what I hope will one day be a feature length documentary. Um, I especially want to thank two people... Nikki and Ben, if it wasn't for your inspiration and your support, I wouldn't be standing here right now. So, without further adieu, this is "Only Rights Can Stop The Wrongs". Sex work is just like any other work, what's the saying? Sex work is work. Sex work is work! Uh, at it's core, the exchange is a sexual one. But like, I think more than that, like it's about personal connection. Sex work is a lot of things that are good, and a lot of things that are not good. People should know the difference between sex work, sex trafficking, and survival work. So I think it's just really important to listen to sex workers, to listen to all aspects of our experience. And I wish that people would have the nuance to talk about it. We shouldn't be working to end sex work. We should be working to afford everyone who decides to do sex work, have it be safe, and be legal. I'm doing it because I love it, and it's interesting. Not to be all sentimental, I just love sex work. Isn't she great? She's awesome. Claire: Yeah. I'm so proud of you. Emily: Thank you. Aw, no problem. Excuse me. Emily: Love you. I'm sorry Claire, you were saying? I just think this film has a lot of potential. Really? Mm-hmm. Needs work, but we can take care of that. We? Yeah, our company. We love to support emerging talent. That would be amazing. Thank you. Thank me at the premiere for the feature. Nice job. Oh, gotta go. Thank you for coming. Thank you for inviting us. So, is it worth your initial investment? Every penny. Yeah, you're kind of my hero. Shut up. Um, I was gonna text earlier... um. It's OK. No, it's not. You were right, I was just scared. And then I went and ruined everything. Everything isn't ruined. Here. We have a present for you. What's this for? You know, Ben and I were talking, and you have a valid point. It's not fair for us to ask you to join us in a relationship. We should all start something new together. And... open. I don't understand. This is your room. If you want it. What? We each have our own room. You can paint it however you'd like. Uh, room? I, I don't know what you guys are talking about. Remember when you asked me why Nikki and I don't live together? Well, it's not really that complicated, we just never wanted to. But that all changed when we met you. With you it's different. We're different. And we want to live with you. Why? Because we're in love with you. And if I say no? We would understand. But, we can't do this without you. There is no us without you. So, what do you say? I think I'm gonna like it here.
