Nice run? Yeah, thanks. - She up yet? - What do you think? - Sienna. - Hmm? Come on. We got packing to do. Go away. Three days. That's it, and then you'll feel better. Sienna. I've invested too much time in your recovery for you mess things up again, okay? - Get up. - Ah. Five minutes. So this is it? This is the place you learned to be... a medic. We used to spend weeks up here trekking through this forest. I hated it. And you wanted to come back. Why? I strangely missed it. The air, the nature, secludedness. It's nice. I'm not sure Sienna would ever like it. Yeah, well, she's nearly over the hill. These next few days will be rough for her, so... - We have to make an effort. - Yes, Sarge. It's Captain to you. Permission to ask a question, Captain? Hmm. What is it? You know that... what we talked about? I think I'm ready to start trying. Maybe even right now. My sister is right there. She's not gonna hear. But seriously there's never perfect time or a place... when there's a perfect person Hmm? Did you just rehearse that? No... Come on. Guys, guys. You have to see this. - Oh, God. - Sienna. Guys, come on. This better be good. Hailey! What could possibly... Wait. Oh, my God. I have to call Lyssa. - Is that what I think it is? - I think so. It's beautiful. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don't know if it's friendly. I don't see the Army anywhere. What if it just got here? If they were here to take over the world they would have done it already. Wooh, wooh, wait, wait. Sienna? Sienna. Josh, Josh? You okay? Baby, wake up. What happened? I don't know. I guess they are not friendly. No, not at all. Oh, my phone's not working. How long were we are for? I don't know, it's night. Few hours? We need to go to the car. We need to check the car radio. Yeah, good idea. Let's just hope it still works. Come on. Let's get packed up. Get the stuff to the car. - We have to go now. - Go? But where? We're staying. We're staying, it's safer. - Okay. - What? We can't go back. What's the point? I'm going to sort out the wood for the fire. Go to the car, check the radio. See if you can find out what's going on. I need you to go to the car. I need you to grab the lighter fluid. Can you do that? The walk will do you good. It'll keep you warm. Josh, look after her. You'll be fine. I'll be fine. Okay Come on. You okay. Is the radio working, then? No, it's dead. Can you not just start the car? There's no point. What do you want from cars that got computers. So whatever that was... would have fried everything... along with our phones. Yes. Okay, let's head back to camp. Let's go. The car is dead. Managed to get it going? You got any food? I have some marshmallows... some bread... some cheese, some soup. You got any water? Guys, there's something out there. Guys, there's something there. Who is there? Stop. Stop! Stop. Stop. Stay back, stay back. Stop! Is she okay? Is she... Check her pulse. There's more of them. We need to go. Give me the bag. Pack the tents up. Pack up the tent. Be careful. Come on. - Your hand. - Don't worry about. Let's pack up the tent and let's just go. Sienna, pack up the tent. - Okay. - We need to keep going. Your sister's not going to go any further. Look, the further we are away the safer we'll be. Come on. Hailey, I'm tired, I'm hungry and we haven't seen one of those things in a while. We're staying here. Are we staying or going? It's broken We need to keep moving. We can't just walk in the dark. I'm not leaving her. If we carry on walking she'll follow us. Come on. You need to pick her up and get out of here. Who are you? Those things are everywhere. What are they? I don't know, mate. But they don't stop. So you shouldn't either. Stay quiet and find a place to hide. Where are you hiding? I've been in my holiday home. Is it far? All right. You three look like you need a hand. Stay quiet. Stay out of sight. Run faster, please. We're faster than them. You don't get it. They don't stop. Wait, wait, wait. This trail. If we follow this trail we can make it to the coast in about three or four days. Three or four days? If we keep up the pace, we can stay ahead of those creatures. Ad you even trust this man? He seems to know where he's going so I'm gonna take my chances - Hailey? - She's right, Josh. Come on. Josh, come on. Come on love. They are coming. You owe me one. Why have they stopped her? They're outnumbered. Okay, we're clear. Josh, keep a lookout. - Map. - Yeah. All right? I'm sorry I brought you here. - I did it for you. - I can't... I can't do this anymore. I need you to do something to make it. I need to dig deep because we need to get the hell out of here. You can, you can. Have I ever lied to you? Have I? I promise you. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. I swear. Okay? It's okay. You've got this. Right, it's just up here. - We call it Emerald Ridge. - Who is we? Me and my business associates. We need to discuss terms before we get there. - Terms? - Yeah, terms. So what do you want? My house, my rules. So you do as I say when I say it. Secondly, we're splitting these supplies and thirdly, you stay out of my tent. Specially her. Fine. Lead the way. Hailey, give me some lights. Give me the flares, give me the flares. Where is he going? To find the key ring. Don't just leave me here. Liam! What are you doing, you stupid prick? Get off me. Josh. Get off him. Josh, you're gonna kill him. Stop it. Stop it. You two, stop. Everyone knows where we are now. You're on your own. What the hell are you playing at? It wasn't me. I wasn't in control. You just say the word and I walk away, I promise. We stick together. Let's go before he steals our stuff. Guys. - Where are you going? - Over there. He's going to get us all killed. You can't just leave us here with no food. Watch me. He was just trying to help. Please. I think it's an old Army compound but a landslide blocked the only route in except one. Welcome to Paradise. Right, you lot set up out here. Josh, your hands. Sienna. - Sienna, come... - Calm down. What happened to his hand since last night? It'll get better tomorrow. Hailey, he's turning into one of them. Be quiet, please. If that stuff in his hand changes him we'll deal with it, okay? I promise. Do you really want to be stuck with Liam? Haily, you can't hide this forever. - And if Liam sees it... - He won't find out. - Okay? - Okay. Everything all right out here in Paradise? I found this old radio. Get it fixed. See if we can find out anything useful. Care to give us a house tour? This ain't the Four Seasons, mate. Stay out. What kind of a person needs a hideout? The kind that survives. You do realize that's an old short wave radio. We're going to need a battery and antenna. - We'll get more luck... - Look, I'm just trying to help. I'm sorry. What's up? What strange is that is in the middle of the forest and it only has a short wave, a few miles max? So whoever originally put that in that tent was in range of a bigger base. Exactly. So why don't we lead them out? I have to figure out what it is first. I'll get some supplies. You can tell Sienna. She'll be more compliant with you. And Liam? I can try. You really think we can tear him away from Paradise. I like you better than your man cave. When was the last time you ate something? What do you care? Let's just say I've seen what going cold turkey can do to a person. Where did you get those? Lets' say there's a good reason why you need to stay out of my tent. We might as well have some fun, hadn't we Before they kill us... or worse. Is someone enjoying herself? Sienna. Don't mind me. Just trying to keep us going. Sienna. Hailey, Hailey. Look at me. Look at me. Ow. Liam. Liam. What? What did you give her? Look, I've seen withdrawal before. Now isn't the time for her to go cold turkey. You seem to think of Sienna better than I do. You expect me to believe you did that for any other reason than to take advantage of her? You dose my sister again... And you'll what? Is there anything else in there you're hiding from us? More food, drugs... weapons? Any secrets you've got you should be worried about. The water is contaminated. Thought you should know. Just wait for the rain. Yeah, what if it doesn't rain? Yeah, you seem to know it all. Know of any other freshwater we could use? It's a bit of a trek. I'm going to need a hand. If you don't think you could do it by yourself then let's go. You two can go. We're staying here considering she can't go anywhere. Josh, can I have a word? Josh. Lads night out Josh. Listen. Listen. Look. It's not safe out there. So, be careful. Be careful of him. Hey. Please. Right. I found some things that can carry water. We'll line your back with these. I found this. You best hang onto this as well. Come on, partner. Sienna. Give me the bottle. No - Sienna, give me the bottle. - No. - Sienna. - No. What are you doing? Hailey said she heard some of those things earlier. When? I don't know. A few hours. We better get to move on. We are in the middle of the forest. What could those things want? I dunno mate. If I were a betting man I'd say they're looking for us two. Do you think we'll make it back to camp? We can try. Come on. What did you do to me? I can't keep doing this. I'm tired. It'll pass. It always does. You killed me. Are you joking? Sienna, you're killing yourself. We only have each other, Sienna. And you keep doing shit like this. You're not only gonna get yourself killed but me too. What a shame that would be. So you know the forest well? Not bad for a druggie. I never called you that. But you did drug Sienna. I didn't force her, mate. You took advantage. You knew she was vulnerable. What are you going to do? Report me? I'm not trying to start a fight. You sure about that? If you was in my position would you not try to do the same thing? I'm just trying to get Sienna and Hailey to safety. Safety? I've taken you three to safety and now I'm taking you to water. So I'm doing a much better job than you, mate. That's for Sienna. Liam, stop. You two abandoned her. Liam, stop. I'm just asking you to do one thing, just one thing. If something happens to me... then you're going to be what they only have. Let's get the water and get out of here. Finally. Come on. It's clear. I think you're understanding, mate. That's going to be a lot tougher getting back especially carrying these water bottles. - It's your... - Sh, sh, sh. She's looking the house. She will live? Something is not right. Be careful. She's been shot. There's no blood. Just get the water and go. You have to Let's have a look. I'm fine. You're not good with a swollen arm. Stay off. I'm fine. I'm fine. Whatever you say, mate. Go. Oh, you, Josh. Josh! Josh. Jooosh! Liam. Liam! Liam. Help me. Josh. Josh. Josh. Here, the gun. Where is Josh? Liam. What the hell happened out there? Liam knows. - Huh? - He knows. Oh, shit. What happened to your face? I don't take it personally. I need to see if it was. I cannot control myself. We need to get out of here. Yeah. Yeah, we do. I guess we all have to thank you for all of this. Sorry. You're just after another fix. So you want? It's your choice. Like you said Okay. Okay. Where is Josh? We didn't hear about. Get out. Something happened to his tent. So? So we're going to go find him. Oh, shit. Josh? Josh. Josh. Josh, can you hear me? Hailey. Hailey. Josh, I will take you back. Okay? This way. Come on. Liam. Liam. Hailey. Someone helps. He's too far. He needs to go now. Just go and call Hailey. You need to let him rest in peace. Hailey. Stop calling your sister. Sienna, you have to let me go. Josh? Josh. Hailey. Josh, wake up. Hailey. Josh. What the hell happened to him? - He's gone into the tunnel. - He's turning, Hailey. We need to get him in your tent. He needs somewhere warm. He is not going in my tent. Liam, he's going in your tent. Please, dont' be stupid, just help me. Liam, please, come on. Christ. Move the bed. Move the bed. Stay with me. We need to keep him awake. Every time he falls asleep he gets worse. Do you have any stimulant or anything? Yes. Hey, baby. Stay awake. Look at me. Please, stay awake. Baby, come on. Stay with me. Come on. Haley. Haley. Haley! What the hell are you doing? He's too far gone. It's not like you said. He still has time. You don't get it, Hailey. I've seen this before. Liam, please. Liam, wait. Just let her say goodbye. It's too dangerous. Tie him up, just... Just give me this. Please. One hour. One hour and then I'm doing it. It's time. All is changing if you like it or not. We need to adapt and learn. Haley. Come on, Hailey. It's time. Get off Josh, please. Last chance. I can make it painless. I've seen those things rip my friends apart. You have no idea how dangerous he is. This is the best thing for him and the best thing for us. Please, may I? Put your hands behind your back. Put your hands behind your back. When it's near the end I'll give him some Quick and painless. You can say goodbye. Don't worry. I won't abandon you. She can check on him. Hailey. Help me. Hailey. Help me. Come on, Sienna. We have to go. We can't stay here. Sienna. I've got a better idea. Please. What are you doing? Bend on your knees. Liam, just let her go. Liam. No! She's done nothing for you. She was going to run away with that thing take all of our supplies and leave us here to run. He's lying, it was for you. I swear, I promise, Sienna. Bullshit. Sienna. Make another move, and I put one in your leg. To this world. Survive. And that's... Hailey. Run, run. Sienna, come on. We have to go. - Please, get up. - No. He was giving lot of shit helping you. But you won't be here if you run. I'm not going anywhere. If you're staying, I'm staying. If you're done, I'm done. Sorry about Josh. Me too. Sienna? Sienna. Sienna. Sienna. I'm sorry.
