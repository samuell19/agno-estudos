This is the 10th borough police station. Yes, ma'am. We're 5 minutes from the Gare du Nord. -I'm to stand guard all night? -Who knows when he'll show up? -Do we have his description? -No. All we know is that he's very discreet and takes all he can from the covered market. Couldn't it close at night? It could, but that's up to the mayor. -Take it up with him. -We really do it all, don't we? -What enthusiasm! -This isn't very challenging. French? Only a little. MAIGRET SEES RED "3405-JC75" I'll get you some help. OK... Hey! What are you doing? -Identity check? -In a way. -For a hit-and-run? -Even better. Ah, here: -3405-JC75, Chevrolet. -That's the one. -It belongs to Luigi Pozzo. -Italian? No. American. He owns the Manhattan Bar. I'll be right with you, Inspector. Forgive me, Inspector. It's very busy. What can I get you? Nothing. Can I ask you something? Ask away. I have nothing to hide. -Where were you last night? -Here. -Sure? -Ask anyone. -You do own a Chevrolet? -Yes. -3405-JC75? -Indeed. Where was it last night at 10:30 PM? Here, like me. Sorry, parked in the rear. Are you sure? I could go check. I haven't used it... -Are you sure? -As sure as my name is Pozzo. Please have a seat. What can I get you? -Beer. -Waiter, 3 beers. -Tell me, Pozzo... -Listen, Inspector, I only use the Chevrolet to take my family out on Sundays. That's odd, because I saw your family vehicle myself last night at 10:30 PM. There were 3 men inside firing at a fourth. -What do you make of that? -I don't understand. My car? Your car. Follow me to the parking lot. You'll see you're mistaken. -Yes? -Lily? -Speaking. -Get me Bill. Bill, it's for you. I give you my word, it was there, like every night. It's gone now. Just like I said. Did your Pozzo make a call when you were at his bar? Not to my knowledge. Let's take it from the top. Tell me everything that happened chronologically. They forced me into their car and we headed for Marly. Did they say anything on the way? In English. I didn't understand a thing. Then? They made me get out of the car and interrogated me. -The 3 of them interrogated you? -No. Their apparent boss stayed in the car, the driver translated the questions and the boxer hit me until I lied down. Did they stop once they found out you were a policeman? It gave them extra motivation. They wanted to know who had taken the body. When did you start talking? When I felt I was losing my teeth. -I'm sorry. -You're only human. What did you tell them? Everything. I told them their victim wasn't dead and that men in a light DS19 grabbed him. -Did that seem to suffice? -I guess, they knocked me out. They asked me if I had contacted the FBI, but I told them that I wasn't high up enough to deal with the FBI. Your fans of the open air are no beginners. They've got nerve! They could do hard time for knocking a pig out. Say, I haven't seen your official report. That's because I haven't written one. I thought there were rules against hiding such an event. I know. You wanted to investigate this yourself, didn't you? It's just... Spit it out. I've never been lucky: pickpockets, ridiculous hideouts and shadowing, that's my lot. Your lot? Please! That's usually how we catch bigger fish. -Sure, but... -"Sure, but..." Listen, Lognon, we'll drive this case home together. But don't think it's in the bag. All we have is this. So? Remember, boss, all you had was a button in the Morin case. Sure, but it was a French button. -These are American sunglasses. -That's a tough nut. What's the motive? It's easy when it's in the 14th borough, -but it might be in the US. -So what should we do? We'll do what we can. And if we find the man to whom those glasses belong, we'll know more. Stay here. Lucas, get me the wiretap department. Torrence, go take care of Lognon in my office. Wiretap department. Try to wind him up a bit. This is Commissioner Maigret. -This is Lambert, sir. -Tap the Manhattan's phone ASAP. On Anatole de la Forge St. in the 17th borough. -Intercept all their calls. -Gotcha. Where's your boss? Over there. Mr. Pozzo? Commissioner Maigret, judicial police. I hope you didn't come all this way just for my car. -I did. Good news, we found it. -That's surprising. -Where is it? -In the judicial police's yard. -Two Pimms. -Excuse me. 9.50 francs. Well, I'm thrilled because it's a very nice car. Eight cylinders. As tough as nails. It's a nice piece of work, but the resale value is nil. What can I get you? A lager. On tap if you have it, no foam. Nice joint. Want to see my new bowling alley? No, thank you. My age and position don't allow it. Tell me, Pozzo, -you like boxing, huh? -Do I "like" it? You're talking to a manager. Well I used to be one a long time ago. -A lot of Americans come here. -Some. Americans stole your car. How do you know? People heard them. They had nasal voices. The inspector who came here yesterday told me. He was kidnapped right at your door. -He was kidnapped? -Yes, by 3 Americans. -What do you make of that? -How should I know? -Is that so? -When I know nothing, -I say nothing. -You're an American citizen? -Yes. -Born in Sicily. Palermo. You really don't seem to want to cooperate with the authorities. That's not very wise for a foreigner. What if the government were to suspend your license? I'd make a formal complaint to the embassy. In my opinion the embassy has better to do than to settle disputes for small merchants. You need grounds for that. You know, the government can find grounds for anything. Commissioner, can I give you a piece of advice? I prefer confessions to advice, but go ahead, you're never too old to learn. No, thanks. You see, Mr. Maigret, you might have always triumphed in Paris because you only had amateur foes. While 9 out of 10 times, Americans are professionals, therefore hardened and organized. You think I'll fall flat on my face? I wouldn't dare say it, Commissioner. Thanks for that piece of advice. That being said, you should know that though I might be indulgent with amateur gangsters, I wage war on professional criminals. -How much do I owe you? -You're my guest. Thank you, but I am not your guest. Then 7 francs. That register trick is a new one. You think they used the same code for me? I'm almost certain of it. When you told Pozzo about his car, he punched in 27.30. His boy made the call and 5 minutes later, the Americans picked you up. So these guys must live close to the Manhattan. Indeed, Lucas. 27.30. Know what I mean? Yes. But how will we find the right exchange? There aren't that many around there. -There's Etoile, Wagram... -Carnot, Laborde... -Balzac. -Galvani. And Elysee. That's 7 numbers to call. Show me what you can do, boys. Have you tried the hospitals again? -Yes, nothing to report. -This might take a while. Our friend Pozzo must have punched in more numbers and sent the Americans running. I'm sorry. Nuns! "Lily Laure, unemployed." What did you find for 27.30? A butcher shop for Carnot. A bailiff for Elysee. How great would it be to incriminate a bailiff? A retired general for Wagram. -Nuns for Laborde. -We're getting off topic. Finally I got a bistro for Balzac. -We could check that out. -Think I got it. Galvani 27.30: Lily Laure, 28B Brunel St. Unemployed. Brunel St., that's right next to Pozzo's. I'll check this out. Actually, Lognon, it's your case. Sort this out and I'll meet you later. -Thank you, Commissioner. -But be careful. -Should we continue the wiretap? -Yes. Keep me posted. Give me the address. Thanks. You say you don't know him though you have his picture. Yes. Watch it! -Be reasonable, kid. -I'm not your "kid." My dad was burly. I'd like to go back to bed now. I work nights. Getting interrogated in the morning gives me wrinkles! That's probably your boss. I'm warning you, change your attitude or you'll be in big trouble. -Miss. -Here. My driver. -Did miss tell you his name? -No. -She said it's Charles Trenet. -Did she? Where's the kitchen? This way. And the fridge is full. What are you doing? -Is she French? -Belgian. -Where does she work? -At Pozzo's. I can speak for myself. It would seem you have a lot of beds. What is "Charles Trenet's" real name? I thought you could speak for yourself. I don't care if you don't. I'll just take the picture, look through our records and know his name. -You want to make me talk. -I'd like to. His name is Bill Larner. We haven't seen each other in 2 years. Sure. And no one slept here last night. -No one slept here. -Fine. See, Lognon? Your driver slept here with her, the 2nd man on the couch and the 3rd one on that mattress. So let's be serious. That tag says this is American. Not to mention bed sheets, the fridge and cigar butts. -I had some friends over. -Listen closely, what Mr. Bill Larner didn't tell you is that the 2 men he brought here are wanted for murder. That makes you an accessory. You could get 5 to 10 years for that. -In jail? -And that's no picnic. And this. "Algin, Miller's, Missouri." Is this yours? -What do you think? -It's Bill's, then? -No. Bill is healthy. -Let's discuss who isn't. I don't know anything. Well, I know everything. You got a phone call yesterday morning from Pozzo's and your guests took off right after. How do you know? I'm the one asking questions here. Sorry. Did they say anything before leaving? No. Not even a thank-you. -Who's the boxer? -I only know his first name. -Charlie. -And the other guy? Cicero. Bill brought them here 2 days ago. They'd just arrived. -From where? -America, of course. -They're Americans. -Did they fly or take a boat? -Bill didn't tell me. -You don't know where they went? Bill took them to the countryside. The countryside? Any idea where? No. -Sure? -I swear! I'll go since you can't be of more help. Lognon, I need to speak with her alone. Of course, boss. I need to leave one of my men here. -No, not him! -Yes, him. And I need to ask you a favor. Don't be too rude to him. That won't be easy. Please try. Say, Mr. Maigret, is Bill in trouble? Say you won't bother him. I'm sure he has nothing to do with this. Unfortunately, miss, love and justice are 2 different things. I told her to behave or we'd arrest her. -Thanks, Commissioner. -Take her to the Manhattan and go to bed, I'll send someone to pick her up after her shift. You think she told us the truth? Of course. It's obvious she doesn't know where they are. Yes... Have a seat, Inspector. Are you married? Yes. -Do you have children? -No. None. Excuse me. -Fill her up. -Yes, sir. Bidoine speaking. Ah, it's you, Bill? I'll be at the doctor's in 45 minutes. -How's Curtis? -Not well. He'll be out for a few days. Keep them busy until then. Hello, doc. Tony Cicero, Dr. Fezin. Which of these gentlemen is sick? Neither one, but they'll pay you in dollars. This way. That way. -The key. -What about it? But... He had a work accident. He's being discharged today. -Time to pack, old chap. -Already? -Jules! -Harry! I'm happy to see you. It's a rare pleasure since I'm rarely in France. I heard you left the intelligence agency. Yes. Diplomacy has its upside. It's for liars. -Like police work. -Unfortunately. Remember your last trip to the US? Do I remember? It was 6 years ago. Yes. You gave a conference in Chicago. -Every mobster was there. -And policeman. -Indeed. -I remember it well. You know Hollywood came calling. -They wanted you to act? -Yes siree. Joking aside, Harry, I have to tell you this visit is motivated by self-interest. Ah. Can I offer you something to drink? -Please. -Sorry, all I have is whisky. Perfect. I hear it's great for arteriosclerosis. I'm listening. I know you're no longer with the FBI, but you must have contacts there. -I might. -I need a tip. Anything I can do to help, Jules. Two of your fellow citizens arrived yesterday in Cherbourg. One is called Tony Cicero and the other, Charlie Cinaglia. So? So... they're driving me nuts. They think Paris is like Chicago during Prohibition. -That's unfortunate. -Indeed it is. So if you could give me some information about them... Give me a minute. I'll try to find out what I can. Thank you. They are indeed in France. We learned of their presence here as soon as they landed. They belong to a powerful racketeering gang led by a man named Walter Douglas. led by a man named Walter Douglas. Would that Walter Douglas be from St. Louis by any chance? Would that Walter Douglas be from St. Louis by any chance? Yes. Do you know what they're doing in France apart from shooting pedestrians? Sorry, Jules, I know nothing about that. That's too bad. Listen, I think you'd better drop this case. I can't just let gunmen shoot people on the street. These guys also shoot at law enforcement. So why aren't you stopping them? We lack evidence against Douglas and all of his men. Whenever we have a witness, they die just before the trial. That's why it'd be better for you to stay... out. These are pros. So I hear. With your permission, Harry, I'd still like my little inspectors to look into this. They might not be very athletic, but they've got principles. You sure are French, never doubting yourself. Oh, I'm filled with doubt. But I never give up. Harry, call me if you hear anything. -Farewell. -Farewell. -Is the boss here? -No, not yet. -I'll wait, then. -Can I get you anything? No, thanks. You can go back to whatever you were doing. -There's a picture missing. -Maybe. The boss changes them from time to time. He should really change them all. -They're all old guys. -Maybe he doesn't like youth. Dunno. I'd be surprised. He has a whole collection in this drawer. Tell me, Commissioner, you also like boxing? Yes. Especially champs like your pal Charlie. You know him? Not personally, but that might soon change. When did you see him last? Yesterday? The day before? Don't tell me he's in Paris! Ten years ago, in Sunrise, he called me "Daddy Pozzo." Now he's in Paris and he doesn't even visit. That's not very nice. Stop pulling my leg, Pozzo. -I don't follow. -Too bad. By that I mean, too bad for you because Charlie was seen in your car. Commissioner, I think you're going too far with your... theories. I might be wrong. It might have been Cicero. -I beg your pardon? -Tony Cicero. C-i-c-e-r-o. Cicero. Doesn't ring a bell. Let me help you, then. He's from St. Louis. St. Louis? Oh my! That's where I got my American citizenship. -What a small world. -It sure is. My investigation is progressing well. Treat me like an adult, will you? Otherwise I'll have you stand in that corner. -A beer, Commissioner? -Please. Just the way you like it: lager, on tap, no foam. -I'll try something else. -How about a Hungarian beer? No. I'd like a special one for 27.30. 27.30? That's expensive for... hop. And worth 5 years at a quiet exchange, far from city noise. 27.30 francs also means Galvani 27.30. And does that ring a bell? Sure. Galvani 27.30 is one of my employees' number. I sometimes call her to ask how she's doing. That's normal. Listen here, Pozzo. Fess up or I might just take you downtown. The boxer and his 2 friends stayed with your employee. Did you arrest Lily? For the time being she's with my colleague Lognon. You know, the guy who was kidnapped outside your bar. Listen, Commissioner, can we speak man to man? That would be advisable. Have a seat, Commissioner. So? Let me tell you what I know of this funny business. But don't... interrupt me constantly. Bill is the only one I know. -Bill Larner? -Yes. Lily's friend. Now, that Bill must be real sorry. -Why? -The 2 others scare him. -They scare me too. -Then don't see them. I don't! Helping a friend in need is one thing, but letting these 2 mafiosi in my bar, that's another! They never came here. What about Galvani? I assure you, that was only to help Bill. -I swear. -I'll surprise you, Pozzo, when I say I believe you. But, you'll have to pay. 27.30 francs, in fact. Are you shutting down my bar? Say, is your pal Bill into sports? Chasing girls is pretty much his favorite sport. -Ah, he also plays golf. -How odd! That's a gentleman's sport. And most people play it in the countryside. Can you hook up the phone in the booth? It's already hooked. Put Lucas on. -Lucas? -Yes. Call all the golf clubs around Paris and find out where Bill Larner plays. -How do you spell that? -Larner. L-a-r-n-e-r. -Larner. -That's it. Thanks. What will you do with that? I'm attached to it. It's been autographed. It's a souvenir. Was a souvenir. Now it's evidence. THIS MAN IS DANGEROUS "We ask anyone who's see this man to call Commissioner Maigret "of the judicial police at Turbigo 92-0." All we have to do is wait. It might take a while. -You don't like waiting, huh? -Not really. I know. Young people think doing nothing is a waste of time, but when you get older, you realize you made a career of waiting. Yes? What a great idea! -Who's the thoughtful one? -I am. That's nice, Lucas. Eugene, add this to my bill. -No, boss, it's on me. -Shut up. -Want something to eat? -Thanks. A drink is all I need. In the meantime, let's plan this. Groussard, take the first shift. Me? Yes. I know it's not fun, but it's your turn, pal. Torrence, go to the Manhattan, but be careful. Breton inspectors stand out in an American bar. I'll have 2 men posted outside. That way no one will pay attention to us. You're right. The Manhattan is our only trap, if we want it to work, we have to lay off a bit. Lognon is at Lily's. We have to find someone to take over for him. You think the 2 Americans will go back to Galvani? Not those 2, the other 2, in the DS. Those 2 vanished. Of course, now that they have the guy, they'll lay low. Don't forget, that guy is at the heart of all this. Finding him won't be easy. It'll be hard work. Hard and traditional work. Thanks, doc. Look at yourself, sir. What did he say? He wants to go to the Manhattan. To the Manhattan? I thought it was a... dirty place. What's going on? Cicero was clear. He wants to eliminate all the witnesses. Starting with Lily, I'm sure. I took your deal so I could go back to America. But only if Lily's with me. You have Curtis. Now save Lily or the deal's off. Alright. I'll tell the boss. OK. "Shut up, you!" Hoodlums! I'll see if he's in. It's for you, boss. She said she read the paper. She sounds foreign. Foreign? Hello? Please slow down, ma'am. Yes, I can hear you. She says she can't leave her room. That she's in danger. Crazies love headlines. Maybe she's sleep-deprived. Where? Sorry. Where? I'm on my way. You're going? Yes, doctor. This "crazy woman" is at the Flandres Hotel, which is right by the covered market, which is where the guy was picked up. Good evening. Mrs. Curtis's room? -Mrs. Curtis? -Yes. Please hurry. -There's no panic! -Stop wasting time. Police. Room #17, first floor. -Should I announce you? -No need. -I'm listening. -Get me the police station and have the owner come up to room 17. A she? Fine. Mrs. Robert? Go up to room 17. -Yes? -Is this the police station? Hold the line while I transfer the call. -Bonfils? -Yes, Jules. -I need you. -OK, Jules. -There's a body here. -Where? At the Flandres Hotel by the covered market. I'll send 2 men. You can count on me, Commissioner. That was Maigret. There's been a murder at the Flandres Hotel. Send 2 men there. Maigret found a body. We're not gonna sleep tonight! Forensics? This is Commissioner Maigret. I'm calling to report a crime at Flandres Hotel, on Compiegne St. Flandres Hotel, Compiegne St. It's by the Gare du Nord. I'll be waiting for you. Room 17, first floor. Hurry. "John Curtis and wife, Montreal, Canada." Yes, Inspector. Your record says they arrived 3 weeks ago. -My records are in order, sir. -I never said they weren't. -Who slept in there? -The husband. They had separate rooms. -Where's the husband? -Out. -Where? -I don't know. -Since when? -Monday. -Did he bring a suitcase? -I don't think so. -Did he tell you he was leaving? -Not at all. Tell me everything you know. I don't know anything. There's been a crime in your hotel. So gather your thoughts. There's always something. Did you see him leave Monday? Yes. The next morning, Lucienne told me #17 hadn't come back, -and his wife seemed worried. -Who's Lucienne? The cleaning girl. Come in. Commissioner, my colleague is downstairs. Stay in the hallway. Did the Curtises have a lot of visitors? Not that I know of. Except for tonight's 2 visitors. Did they get mail? Did they use the phone a lot? They never used the phone or received letters. Tell me about the husband. He was short and skinny. He had bad eyes. -Bad eyes? -He wore black glasses that he never took off. Not even at night. Are you sure? Positive. That struck me. -Does your Lucienne live here? -Yes, on the 7th floor. Tell her to come see me. Very well, Inspector. Don't touch the doorknob. Guard, close the door. Come on, go upstairs. -This way, gentlemen. -Thanks. -The forensics team, sir. -Good evening. The lady's in the bathroom. Take a picture of the doorframe. Yes, sir. -Take that suitcase too. -Yes, sir. Answer their questions and try to be nice. You never know with the police. -Come in, miss. -Want me to leave? If you don't mind. Excuse me. -She's quite the businesswoman. -Yes. She almost fired me for a delinquent account. -Can you believe it? -Is that so? -You're Commissioner Maigret? -Yes. -You're looking for clues? -Tell me about the Curtises. Tell you? That won't be easy. I saw right away they were an odd couple. Why? Because they slept in separate rooms? -Yes. -It's often the case as we get older. At what time do you clean the rooms? Anytime. Can be morning or afternoon. Depends if the clients are sleeping afterwards or not. Not clients who come here to make whoopee. -Those 2. -Ah, them? I waited for her to leave, but he was always here. -Did she often go out? -To buy him food. -He never went outside? -Sure, at night. -Did he look like he was hiding? -Yes! Whenever I knocked, I had to say, "It's Lucienne," -or he wouldn't open. -Did you sleep with him? -No! -He wasn't your type? Not at all. Couldn't know what he's thinking behind his sunglasses. -He never took them off? -Never. Thanks, sweetie. You can go. -Is it gonna be in the papers? -Probably. -Maybe they'll talk about me. -Maybe in the crime section. Sorry I couldn't give you the front page or the arts section. -Gentlemen. -Goodbye, Commissioner. Can you describe the 2 guys who came by earlier? Well-dressed. Looked Italian-American. -Did one look like a boxer? -Yes. -What did they talk about? -Don't know. It was in English. They didn't want to be announced. -Did you see them leave? -No. I was in the kitchen. -What about you? -No. Hope this won't affect business. I doubt it. Good night. Good night. Taxi! A beer and a phone token, please. Thank you. This is Maigret. Get me the commissioner. Yes, sir. Commissioner, Maigret calling for you. Hello? You again? Told you he'd be bothering us all night. What's up? Bonfils, this is serious. You have to act fast. -I'm shadowed by 2 guys. -Really? Listen carefully, I'll leave this place in 15 minutes and try to lead them towards the market. That doesn't leave us much time. Don't worry, we'll be there. -Are you armed? -No. For 30 years I've been telling you never to go out unarmed! Let it go! In 15 minutes, got it? -Yes, got it. -Good. -How much do I owe you? -With the token? Two francs. -There you go. -Thanks. Did he get you? Take him away. Hurry! Warn police HQ the commissioner is coming. Hello, Manhattan Bar? Get me Lily. Hold the line. Lily? I've been trying to get a hold of you since 7 PM. I have a message from Bill: Leave the Manhattan right away. -Cicero's after you. -Cops are tailing me. They want to eliminate you. You have to go. Head to Garneau Avenue Take the back door. Got it? Garneau Ave. -Take the back door. -He's here. Friends... Got it? Over there. Why are you here instead of Bill? That's all. That faucet doesn't work. Try the other one. Commissioner? I heard a very interesting call from the Manhattan. -Go ahead. I'm listening. -Rolling. Lily? I've been trying to get a hold of you since 7 PM. I have a message from Bill: Leave the Manhattan right away. -Cicero's after you. -Cops are tailing me. They want to eliminate you. You have to go. Head to Garneau Avenue. Take the back door. -He's here. -That's it. Thanks. -Got a gun? -Yes. -Gimme. -Wake up Lognon and Lucas and have them come to the Manhattan. -Armed? -To the teeth. -Farewell. -Farewell. -Boss. -We came in when we heard shots. The guy fired in the air as a diversion. The room was pitch black. When Pozzo turned the lights back on, Lily had vanished. The guy must have taken advantage of the panic to follow her. See, Commissioner, I had nothing to do with this. And you didn't see a thing, I bet. I turned the lights off to help Lily. Find bullet holes and stop the bowling alley. Check everyone's ID, be they American or not. -Gather your employees. -Right away. The telegraph operator too! Did Lily leave dressed like that? Where are the lockers? Go back to the main room. -Where's the boss? -By the lockers. Interesting. This one isn't from St. Louis. "Dubuc Drugstore, Lamorlaye, Oise." It's French. Isn't there a golf club in Lamorlaye? -I think so. -What's up? Time to play golf. -Call the gendarmerie. -And the riot squad. I'll see you tomorrow at the police station. Are you familiar with Lamorlaye? Yes, Commissioner. Well, I drove through it several times. Find that drug store. Algin... Algin... Here. Bought this very afternoon. Dr. Fezin asked for some and I gave it to him myself. You know that doctor? Vaguely. He comes in from time to time. He lives nearby. His estate is called "L'enclos." It's by the golf course. Thank you. Use your skeleton key. Torrence, take 2 men with you and go to the back of the house. Lognon and Lucas, you're with me. This is no time to screw up. Be careful. There. Yes. I'll be done in a minute. Police! -That was close! -Search the whole house. That's the boxer! No need to crow. I had just tended to him! This guy is dangerous and you know it, doc. What is he doing at your place? He had been wounded. I'm a doctor. You treat just anyone, huh? Yes, anyone, even animals. But not pigs. The College of Physicians mustn't like you very much. Social Security either. I hate filling out forms. I don't want to live in a Kafkaesque world. You should change your policy before you find yourself -in handcuffs. -I just found this. This is for you, Lognon. Lucas, go search upstairs. Did you buy this algin at Dubuc Drugstore? -No point denying it. -Tell me about Cicero, then. Cicero? Ah, the tall one. Interesting patient. His congenital coxalgia affects his mind. He's maladjusted, neurotic, obsessive -and a hypochondriac. -I don't care about that. -and a hypochondriac. -I don't care about that. -I want to know where he is. -I don't know that. -What about Bill Larner? -Could be together. The 3 of them left for Paris tonight, but only this one came back, with a 6.35 bullet -in his left shoulder blade. -What about Lily Laure? Don't know her. Excuse me. -What did he say? -He's insulting me -by calling me a bastard. -Let me worsen his coxalgia! He isn't the one with coxalgia. Well, I can still rough you up! I'm this close to punching your patient! -Please, go over there. -It was locked, so we had to force the door open. Go ahead. I'll join you in a minute. Lucas, go see Torrence downstairs. Doc, do you have a car? Oh no. When I saw the state of the roads last Easter, I knew I better sell my car if I wanted to live. -So why is your garage locked? -When they arrived, they took the keys. Which is annoying: My climbing epiphyllum must be suffocating. It's not the only one. Come with me. Wait for me here, Lognon. This way. Bill... Yes, they took care of him. Using this. Go call Compiegne, Torrence. Lucas. Where and how did you meet him? I didn't really know him. Some people you only know as acquaintances. Could you be any more precise? Stick to facts. Facts... He sold a bad car to someone from the golf club. When the car started, the rear axle fell to the ground. They got into a fight and I stitched him up. He recuperated here, in my house. You didn't think him bringing you 2 killers was strange? Hospitality is unconditional for me. When I open my door, I don't ask for a passport. Bill Larner was a scoundrel, but a type I liked, who hated the establishment, but incapable of doing any harm. -He loved life too much. -But he was killed here, so you can stop the eulogy for now. What did the other 2 have against him? Bill had been living in France for 3 years and was homesick. But he was banned from going back to America. So he became an informant to redeem himself. -Indeed. -For? Am I in big trouble? You are, no matter what you say. So talking can't do any harm. Funny, I always wanted to get into big trouble. It was a dream, like going to China. You'll go to jail in Fresne or Clermont. It's closer, but as exotic. Now please stop daydreaming and tell me who did Bill Larner -play golf with. -Some kind of cop. What do you mean? Working for an American intelligence agency. Bill told me. He came to see him here 2 weeks ago. He was with another tall, elegant American. They had a car. What kind of car? -A Citroen DS. -What color? -Grey. -Sure? Yes. Lucas, we have to leave now. Lognon, take the 2 men downtown -and you, stay here. -OK, Commissioner. 7 Bonneau St. Slow down. This is Bonneau St. Number 7 is on my side. Numbers 15, 13... -Who is it? -Police! -Mr. McDonald, please. -Second floor, to your right. Thank you. It's Maigret. -What is it? -Judicial police. -Mr. McDonald? -He's still sleeping. Let's wake him. -What are you doing here? -Mr. Maigret! I have some good news. Your Bill checked out early. Otherwise I'd have arrested him. -I don't believe you. -You should. Some situations call for blind trust. Lucas, tell her how we shipped him to New York. -OK, Commissioner. -Who are you calling? Cicero must be nearby. If he saw us come in here, he must have fled. We have to warn Lognon, call airports, stations and ports! I'm convinced of the contrary. If he goes back to America without having killed his mark, that'd be the death of him. I'm sure he's in one of these cars. But I don't know which one. Take some men, look for him discretely. OK, sir. -I sent the girl home. -Well done. -Here's Mr. Curtis. -Sir! Look at this. Mr. Curtis is actually Polar and he's not from Canada but from Saint-Etienne. Polar, who robbed the bank in Villeurbanne? No! In Villefranche-sur-Saone! Sentenced to 20 years of forced labor by the courts. And who escaped the following year. See, Mr. Maigret, I know this case. That may be, but in the meantime, arrest everyone except Mr. McDonald, who has diplomatic immunity as he works for the embassy. I'll have to call Washington. I already called the Interior Dept. You don't want to cause a diplomatic incident. -Nor a miscarriage of justice. -This case isn't what you think. -I'm with the FBI. -And I with the judicial police. -To each his own. -Jules! The time for "Jules" is over. To discuss the case, call Commissioner Maigret's office after 8. Are you Cicero? Well... I figured out a few things, but I'd like you to tell me the whole tale. First question: Mrs. Curtis wasn't your mistress, -but was she your wife? -No. I worked with her. It was best to be married for my new identity. This marriage was just for show. So you used her as beard, so to speak. Yes? Mr. McDonald just arrived. Make him wait with his fellow Americans. Let's get back to the subject. Why are you back in France and why did the 2 Americans want to kill you? With all due respect, I'd prefer to let Mr. McDonald answer this. As far as I know he works for the FBI at the embassy, but he's no lawyer. I didn't mean it like that. But my case is... unique. Well, if this is a "unique case..." Lognon, can you come in here? And bring Mr. McDonald and his right-hand man. You, sit over there! Please have a seat. Lognon, sit by my side. I haven't slept a wink and I need affection. So? Listen, Jules, -we're colleagues. -No, competitors. Have you spoken with Washington? -Yes. -Was the line any good? Not too much static? -No. -Good. Now tell me the truth. Because you don't fool me. I would like you to hand Polar over to me. Why would I do such a thing? So he can testify. Polar sought refuge in the US. He'd lived a peaceful life in St. Louise but... He witnessed a murder. The murderer was Walter Douglas. Ah, the untouchable Douglas. We finally had a witness, but Douglas was trying to have him killed. So he came back to France but Douglas found out and sent his killers after him. Exactly. Now tell me, why did you try to get in my way? I was ordered not to let you arrest him. That wouldn't have stopped him from testifying. It would have. I have to go back to America to testify. I traded my testimony for freedom. Isn't that blackmail? He's been rehabilitated. In 6 months, he could benefit from the statute of limitations. You want him to rot in jail? What good would that do? Douglas would run free. And that guy's a killer. A real one. -So what do you say? -Mr. Maigret. Don't "Mr. Maigret" me! -You want to go back to America? -I do! You might think you're free, but you risk getting killed, before or after that trial. While here, you can do a bit of jail, testify safely against Douglas by proxy and get a remission of sentence. -Really? -Yes and no. It's to show Mr. McDonald that any arbitrary reasoning can be twisted to anyone's advantage. Think what you will, but will you hand him over or not? I would, but it's not up to me. -Who is it up to? -Lognon. Me? Of course. Isn't this your case? You know all the facts. So what do you say? -There are pros and... -And cons, yes, you're right. There are many pros. -So what do you think? -And you, Commissioner? I'd hand him over. -That may be the best thing. -Yes. Fine, go home, Polar. Lognon, take care of the 2 gentlemen. Torrence, send these guys to jail with all the care reserved for pros. Lucas, take the doctor's deposition. With all the leniency due to a man lost in the barbarian time of the machines. We have nothing more to say to each other. Must I remind you that Cicero and Cinaglia are American? So what? You'll need to testify at their trial. Never! Or I'll take Polar back. Your choice. Go through the official channels to get them. Alert the chancery because I warn you, I will do everything in my power to make this as hard as I can. I'm keeping these 2! They killed one of my men and I want to make them pay! Harry, you know the way. Jules, shall we make peace? We were never at war. We were only doing our jobs. Boss? They're looking for you. For a crime at 129 Bagnolet St. -What kind? -Crime of passion. Good. Put Lognon on it. This might be the case he's been waiting for. I'm off to sleep. Good night.
