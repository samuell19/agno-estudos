Okay, so far I'd say everything looks real nice. Much, much romantic. Well, it's a very special day for Derek and me. We've been married a whole year. Now, Bridget. Each setting needs a knife. That's one way to do it. Why don't you light the candles? Hot flowers! Hot flowers! Maybe it's a good thing Derek's late. Derek always late. Sometimes he not come ever. I know. Odette awaits you for dinner, sir. -Right. Now, the King of Lincolnshire... -He arrives on Sunday, sir. -Give him the red carpet, Rogers. -Yes, Derek. Trumpets, banners, banquets, the whole thing. You'll need to present him with a gift. Good catch. Don't let me forget that. It needs to be a half shade darker, guys. Don't forget. Your mother's birthday is coming up. I'll have to think of something there. And, Rogers, those shrubs down by the lake, they really need to be trimmed. Yes. Yes, yes, I'll take care of it. Odette awaits you for dinner, sir. Thanks. I'll be there in just two minutes. More like 20. There. Now all we need is a prince. Odette, I'm sorry. I can't make it for dinner. Someone started another fire in the western fields. I've got to go. Wait! Wait! Wait! I saw the brute who started the fire. He's a huge fellow with an ugly face. He's got powerful arms and he's deadly with a bow and arrow. Don't lose him, Puffin. Brom and I'll follow. No fear. I hate it when he says that. -I'm going to help put out the fire. -No, it's too dangerous, Odette. They'll need these blankets. You better go with her, Brom. Oh, well, I'd rather go with you, but, if you say so. Speed. You and Jean-Bob take the rivers. -See if you can slow this guy down. -Right away, sir. Speak for yourself. Slow down! Slow down! Slow down! Speed! Speed, slow down for... Jeesh! Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Hang on. Darn. Excuse me, monsieur. You have missed my stop. I want to get off. I said I want to get off. But not that bad. No one hurts the prince. Not while Puffin's around. -Jean-Bob. What are you doing? -Just stretching my legs. Better take cover. Puffin. Careful, Derek. He ka-pewed me into a tree. I've sprained me tail. I won't be flying for a while. I'll tell you that much. I'll get you home, Puffin. Why would someone wanna burn our fields? I'll tell you why. To lead a daring young prince into a trap. Don't tell anyone, Puffin. Especially Odette. -I don't want her to worry. -Me beak is sealed. Thank you. We're awful lucky to have a princess like you, madam. I'm the one who's lucky. You're an angel. That's why I married her. You're so good, Odette. You're so kind. That was an interesting way to spend our anniversary. Yeah. -Today's our anniversary? -Well, yesterday, by now. -Odette, I'm so sorry. -You've been busy. Yeah, but that's no excuse. Do you hate me? -No, I don't hate you. But, Derek... -I'm gonna do better, Odette. I promise, from now on, you come first. Everything else will just have to wait. I can see why I married you. You're so good at saying you're wrong. Here he comes. Well, too bad you didn't live to see this day, old partner of mine. We could've shared it all. But, no, you had to betray me. We conquered the forbidden arts together and then you drove me underground. Thought you were real smart, didn't you? Until you met Prince Derek. But, today... Today, Derek met his match, me. Now that he's out of the way, I'm gonna go back to our old castle and get the forbidden arts proving that I was always the greater man. Hurry up, Knuckles. Today we conquer the world. Well, it... Well, what? What? It didn't work. He beat the trap. He didn't beat the trap. No one beats a Clavius trap. You didn't set it right, nitwit. If we don't finish off Derek, I can't get into his castle and get the forbidden arts. Capisci? Derek's been living in there for a whole year, he's probably found it all anyhow. No, no, no, no, no. He'll never find the forbidden arts. Rothbart and I were the only ones who knew where it was. Now don't you look at me like that. I will get the forbidden arts. I will prove my greatness and I will destroy Derek, the boy you were too weak to defeat! More birthday wishes. I love it. I love how my fellow royals shower me with praise and respect. The Duke of Wixom. "Dearest Uberta, "don't be sad. Don't be blue. We still think you're nifty. "You're still here, you're still kicking, even though you're 50!" That he should even mention the very number! "So, you're turning..." I've got a number for you, buddy! Eighty six! Where is Derek's letter? Surely he wouldn't treat me so impolitely. Where is it? He's so busy with his new kingdom, he's forgotten his old mother. Wait. My birthday isn't until tomorrow. A message from Prince Derek. Yes. Let me guess. He's holding a ball in my honor. No. He's established a new holiday. Uberta's Day! Actually, someone has set his fields afire. -Uberta. -It's more than I can bear. No one was hurt, dear Queen. Don't you know what this means, Chamberlain? -War? -No! Now Derek is sure to forget my birthday. These are... These are the choices for Sunday's dinner with the King of Lincolnshire. I'm thinking he'd like my fettuccine Alfredo. I'm thinking he'd be crazy not to. Thank you, sir. There you go, guys. Are we ready, Bridget? It smells awfully good. Tell Odette I'll be right there. Good morning, Prince Derek. Good morning, fellows. What have we got? Here are all the clues from the strange events of last night. A piece of the suspect's clothing. Excellent. Find out who makes this kind of cloth, Brom. And more importantly, who buys it. If you really want answers, I might have to get rough. -Try not to hurt anyone. -Including yourself. Now, here's an arrow from the trap and most impressively a mold of the suspect's footprint. Good work, Rogers. Only got one of them? Makes my job a little tougher. That's gonna be some picnic. Derek's trying to make up for forgetting our anniversary. -No. -Oh, sorry. I'll be grounded for two weeks with this bum tail. You know, no one ever told me what happened last night. Your prince almost got me killed is what. There you go! Exaggerating again. Exaggerating? How'd you like to have arrows... Arrows? You're a funny one, Jean-Bob. Don't pick on Jean-Bob. It's all right, Odette. You can't expect much from these commoners. Don't tell me the little fellow still thinks he's a prince? I don't think. I know. But Odette gave you the kiss and you're still green and funny-Iooking. Something went wrong. That's all. I am a prince. Laugh your beaks off. You'll see. Odette, I'm really sorry, but some big clues have come up. I got to go after this guy. Of course. What about your mother's birthday? You were going to surprise her first thing in the morning. I just can't. Surely these clues can wait a couple of days, can't they? I've got the guy's footprint. He's not going to change his feet. Mother's just going to have to understand. I've got to do what's best for the kingdom. It's the wrong kind of magic Now you see him, now you don't Used to be he'd drop anything for me But not lately, he won't He used to slay dragons To keep me from harm And come running to my open arms I want the magic of love again The look of longing in his eyes All the wonder and surprise Of knowing that the best Is yet to come I need the magic of love again Give me a magic wand to wave Tell me the magic words to say To bring back the magic of love No illusions He's a man who has many dreams But it's so confusing To be always in between I want the magic of love again That subtle sorcery of the heart The fire his smile used to start That makes me feel I'll never get enough Give me a magic wand to wave Repeat the miracle that gave us The wonderful magic Of love Happy birthday to me Happy birthday to me Happy birthday, poor Uberta Happy big 50 to me Chamberlain! "Happy birthday, Mother." I knew he'd remember. Hello, down there. Hello! How cute. What are you doing here, Uberta? They're having a big party for you over at Swan Lake! A party? Oh, well, Derek didn't need to do that. Go on. Get in, Your Highness. Welcome aboard, dear Queen. And now, I'd like to point out some safety features. But there are none! And here we go! Have a safe trip. It's lovely. I can see everything. There's the Duke of Wixom's home. He sent me the most obnoxious birthday card. There he is. What I wouldn't give for an overripe melon. There's Swan Lake. I can't wait. Why are we flying away from it? There's been a little change in our flight plans. Our new destination, my place. No one spoils my birthday! Stop it! Don't you know the rules? You'll take me to Derek's or I'll throw you out like a jar of bad mayonnaise. May I offer you a seat? When Derek finds out about this you will be in significant trouble. I'm not scared of your little boy. In fact, I've got a ransom note that tells him exactly how to find me. Whatever it is you have planned, you will never get away with it because you are a bad person and bad people stand no chance against good people, like my son, Prince Derek. Did your parents ignore you as a child? Tell Queen Uberta. What dark secret lurks inside that tiny, twisted mind of yours? Come on. Out with it! Don't you ever shut up? Have you any idea the penalty for kidnapping? Where's a gag? Give me anything, a sock. I'm not even talking about kidnapping a queen. Just your basic kidnapping. I don't hear you. I'm not listening. I am talking to you! Get her in the pen. Yes. Get her in the pen! Don't touch me! I may be a hostage, but I am still the Queen and it is still my birthday. You will walk five steps behind me. No more, no less. Come. One, two, three, four, five. Sorry. Bow. Now, I am sure it is well past lunch. My favorite birthday treat is cucumber sandwiches and peppermint tea. Go. -What are you doing? -You know, I was just getting her cucumber sandwiches and some peppermint tea. I see. Fascinating. Get to work on the trap. Make sure to slice the cucumbers thinly. She is the Queen. Really? How nice. How thoughtful. And what are you? Miss Suzy Homemaker? And what am I? A piece of lint? Do I have to remind you that I am about to become the most powerful man in the world? All right. Don't bring me lunch. But my birthday dinner better be awfully special! I came as quickly as I could. If I'd been there for her birthday, this wouldn't have happened. It's my fault. -I've got to go after her. -Yes. Yes, of course. You must. -I want you two to go to Mother's castle. -What? Me with him? The note says I have to come alone. If I don't, he'll attack Mother's kingdom. Don't worry, Derek. If anything happens, my quiver is full. You mean you're filled with quivering, don't you? That map's taking you in to another trap, Derek. Don't let anything happen to Odette. Derek will find the Queen and come clompity-clomping back before you know it. You can't hide from the Prince. -He is brave. -Brave? -He's a fool. -Jean-Bob. All this jumping into danger. He's a prince like me. Too important for risking his life. I've been a moving target I've been a sitting duck I've almost been an alligator's food And all because somebody with more courage than good sense had to be rescued from his own ineptitude Well, if commoners with not so much to live for want to jeopardize their lives maybe that should be allowed But a prince is born for higher things and shouldn't risk his life like an ordinary member of the crowd But, Jean-Bob that's what you do for a friend Oh, that's what you do for a friend That's what you do for a friend, my friend That's what you do for a friend You hang on through the hard times Make them laugh when they're feeling low And when danger is near, you say No fear And you go where you have to go And you never back down And you never back out Keep fighting even when you're filled with doubt That's what you do for a friend Oh, that's what you do for a friend That's what you do for a friend, my friend That's what you do for a friend This is ridiculous Zipping into danger, dashing into traps Rushing into an untimely end You foolhardy heroes will end up with your backs against the wall in deep trouble once again Now, some may think it noble to die like that and be immortalized in songs about the past And you may think it wise to have a harrowing demise so that life's exciting right up to the last But, Jean-Bob that's what you do for a friend Oh, that's what you do for a friend That's what you do for a friend, my friend That's what you do for a friend And you even stick your neck out No matter how scary it gets You go out on a limb when the chances are slim And you do it with no regret Help! Help! And you never give up You never give in You keep on trying Through thick and thin That's what you do for a friend Oh, that's what you do for a friend That's what you do for a friend, my friend That's what you do for a friend Cute. Catchy. Didn't work. Nope. That's not going to work. Put the seascape back in the center and put the portrait of the ugly man above the couch. And get rid of that tacky velvet thing altogether. Yes, Your Highness. What is this? If I'm going to spend my birthday here everything must be perfect. You're driving me nuts with this birthday thing. Let go of my servant. Your servant? I taught him everything he knows. And furthermore, this ain't your castle, lady. Let go. Lady? Your Highness is the proper way for one of your class to address one of mine. Not so hard. Don't hurt him. He hasn't finished my cake. You are a hostage! And you're supposed to be minding the traps. I was serving Her Majesty. It's time for a little worker retraining. Your job is to put an end to Derek. Now, don't come back here until you've done it, or else... What's going on here? You haven't been excused. The gifts need to be wrapped. The cake needs to be frosted. Who's going to sing Happy Birthday? I had a feeling you'd be alone. -Who are you? -Only the guy... Derek's looking for. What? Get out. I just got here. Besides, I came to pick up something. The forbidden arts. What are you talking about? Derek destroyed all that when Rothbart died. You'd like to think so, wouldn't you? I don't know who you are but when Derek comes back... Derek ain't coming back. He's walking into a trap. A Clavius trap. -No! -Yes. You see, me and old Rothbart worked on the forbidden arts together. -Clavius. -You know him? They're here all right. Safe and tucked away. And once I get them, this world will never be the same. Now, now, now. I can see I'm going to have to lock you up in the tower. Let go of me. -Unhand me. Let me at him. -Me know how to get forbidden arts. -You do? -Deep under castle. Spooky-spook. Yeah. We'll get it before he does. Okay, that's one idea. Any others? Come on, Jean-Bob, let's... Down to the cellar. No fear. Did you know that saying makes me want to hit you with something? Me tail. Sure. Let's all take this hidden stairway into the rat-infested underground. That's nice. Come. Come. Chop-chop, Bridget, before Clavius gets here. Me look for rock-rock. Rock-rock. Rock-rock. She's calling a rock. We're dead. I'll help you find it. Yeah, let the turtle help. That'll get things cooking. The forbidden arts. No! No! Hurry, we got the forbidden arts. Hurry, we got the forbidden arts. -Unlock lock. -There's no time. Hurry! Derek's in danger. All right! All right! This morning I was relaxing, minding my own business, suddenly, I'm an amphibian locksmith on the run. Why don't I learn my lesson? I am so dumb! Yep, you're dumb all right. We've got to do something. Derek's headed for a trap. I wish I could fly, Odette, I'd...out that window. That's it. Change me into a swan. You must know something about the forbidden arts. It's the only way to save Derek. If Clavius get orb, Odette be swan for much-much time. -You could be stuck as a swan forever. -Derek will die if I don't. Fly on, Princess! We'll keep this orb away from Clavius, even if it costs us our lives. Our lives? Your lives. Do it! Someone's gonna pay for this. What? It's you! Rothbart's little stooge! Frog-frog. No, no! If that thing hits the ground, this whole place will explode. Remember, you're grounded. But I can glide. -Hurry, Speed! -I'm coming. Set! Hut! -Speed! -Coming. No! Not again! Speed! Get down here fast! Your turn! Let's give them the old... Speed. I don't want that thing in here. -Have no fear. -Speak for yourself. Derek. No. Toodleoo. Sticky situation, huh? You can't let me die like this. Wanna bet? Help me! Help me! I beg you. Please. Goodbye, hero boy. Derek! Derek. Odette, how did you... What happened? There's no time to explain. We have to get back to the castle. Odette, thank you. So that's where they're hiding it. Kind of spooky. Come, come. Coast clear. -Are you sure it's safe? -Yeah, sure, sure. -And bring the orb. -Bring orb-orb. Good work, Bridget, I was afraid old Clavius was going to find us. Everyone in for a dip? I should've known it was a trick. Now Odette will be a swan forever. Not to mention the bad guy's got the orb and he's probably gonna blow the whole kingdom to bits. Thank you both for that cheery little update. Come on, frog-frog. You can do it, buddy. No fear, little fella. Shut up with the "no fear" stuff, or I'll jump on purpose. Clavius is taking off. Drop chain-chain, quick! All right, Jean-Bob, crank us up. Sure. And after that, I'll fly around the world and reverse the earth's rotation. Eat your heart out, Rothbart. This world is about to see the reign of Clavius! Just a skoosh more. -What am I, a Slinky? -You keep forgetting, Jean-Bob. No fear! That does it! Derek, that's him. -He's got the orb. -What? The forbidden arts. As long as he has it, I'm stuck as a swan. Let's go. Are you still mad at us, Jean-Bob? Why should I be mad? I like hanging on for dear life. Next to snorkeling, it's one of my favorite activities. How dare you leave in the middle of my birthday? Well, I hope you brought a gift to say you're sorry. A fish bowl wasn't exactly what I had in mind. All right, we gotta get that orb. Jean-Bob, you're in charge of distracting Clavius. Okay. And you're in charge of coming up with a better idea. You gotta be in charge of something. I'll be in charge of two things, running and hiding. Your Highness, I am going to make this a birthday you will never forget. Let the powers of the forbidden arts flow into me. It's stronger than I thought. It's mine! It's finally mine. The power to create. Wretched crook. The power to change. Despicable! The power to destroy. You horrid man! You horrid man! The power of the forbidden arts is mine. All mine. You may not like my newfound power But I think it's totally hot And you may hate the way I use it But am I concerned? I'm not! 'Cause the power to create is mine And the power to change, oh, joy! The power to rearrange your life And the power to destroy! Now I give the orders and you're gonna take 'em Things are gonna be the way that I make 'em I'll be the one who gets every break You gotta love it You gotta love it Every day's gonna be a vacation Now I'm the king of gratification I'll do whatever I want everyday You gotta love it You gotta love it I'll take aim at any target I'll stake claim to every wealth And I think I'll fill the cup of power And drink it to my health Yeah, I won the wish of every human Everything anyone could consume And thousands of lifetimes all in one room You gotta love it Yeah! You gotta love it You gotta love this power of mine What's he got? Frog-seeking missiles? I'll take aim at any target I'll stake claim to every wealth And I think I'll fill the cup of power And drink it to my health I've won the wish of every human Everything anyone could consume And thousands of lifetimes all in one room You gotta love it Yeah! You gotta love it You gotta love this power of mine Rock 'n' roll! Oh, no. Fly across and make sure Mother's okay. Be careful. -I thought you were dead. -So did I. I should've taken care of you how I know best. With these! I beg you, grab my hand. I'm slipping! Please! You can't let me die like this. Thank you. Thank you. Sucker. Get off me! Now, you're gonna join your little friend. -Bye-bye, birdie. -No! -Now what? -I didn't plan any further than this. You can change yourself into whatever you like. You'll always be a third-rate villain inside. -You're pushing it, Highness. -On the other hand, no matter what you do to me, I will always remain a queen whose birthday it is. -Furthermore... -That does it! I warned you not to yak so much. But no! Yak, yak, yak! So that's what you get. A yak! No, I can't shut her up! I hope you like bread and water because that's the daily fare in prison. You're up to about five life sentences, bub! Keep it up! Keep it up! You're only digging yourself deeper and deeper and deeper! I can't take it! That does it! You're getting the guillotine! What doesn't talk? A fly! Yes, yes, a fly! Go ahead. I'll fly right out of here. Who cares? You'll be a fly. I'll buzz around your ear at night for the rest of my life. Which will be about three to five days. So long, Your Flyness. Watch out for spider webs. Don't you dare hurt my mother. -What? -You heard me. It's over. Far from it. I'll distract him. Odette, free Mother, and then get everyone into the balloon. -What about the orb? -Leave the orb to me. You want to have a little swashbuckling? Jean-Bob's lock and key, at your service. I'm being rescued by little animals? Well, I'll go with it. I'm out of here. Did you really think you could beat the forbidden arts? I'm a prince. Hey, hey! Look, look! I'm a prince! I'm... I'm... I'm a frog again. Knock it off, Jean-Bob, and get in the balloon. Now I'm gonna finish you one piece at a time. Help! Derek needs help! Blast me and this whole place will blow. Wake up, little buddy. Oh, no. Quick, everyone. Into the balloon. It doesn't matter where you go. I will get that orb. It doesn't matter where you go. I will get that orb. It is my destiny, Prince Derek. Sorry, Clavius. But this orb will change Odette back to a princess. And then I'll make sure it's destroyed forever. No! Save yourself, Odette. Go. -No, Derek. -Go! Don't worry, Odette. We'll find a way to change you back. There's got to be a way. The moon will rise any minute, Odette. Do you really think it'll change her back? Me don't know if it be moonlight or if it be Rothbart spell that had change her back before. Well, it's our only hope. For Jean-Bob, too. It will work, Odette. It has to. Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. Come on. Come on. You saved us all, Jean-Bob. You had no fear... I'll rip your beak off if you say it again. You're a prince in my eyes. I was a prince in everyone's eyes, no? Are you going to tell me you didn't see me as a prince? I think he's still got some damage in the attic. I don't believe this. I was a prince. Don't push your luck, Jean-Bob. But, I don't think... Hey, you out there. Quit smooching and tell me something. Did you or did you not see me as a prince in the mountain? This is not happening. It's a conspiracy. I was a prince, I tell you. A prince! Happy Birthday! Fifty and loving it. Derek. Derek. -Derek! -What is it, Rogers? The King... The King of Lincolnshire has arrived, sir. What? He wasn't supposed to be here until tomorrow. That's what I said. And he told me, "When you're the richest king in the world, you can arrive when you like." -You take care of it, Rogers. -Me? He'll ask where you are. What do I say? Tell him I'm on a picnic with a princess. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself! Where is everybody? Derek?
