I was with her for two weeks And I couldn't get her into bed Suddenly it came to me... I wrote her a love letter "Come to my place tonight or I will cut my wrists" And did she? She came running to save me Would it work for me? It's worth a try, don't you think? - I'll get started - Here you go What should I write? "If you don't come to my place, by midnight... ...I'll cut my wrists" Add a few things, like "I love you", etc... Sign it Now go and give it to her... ...then go home and wait You?
