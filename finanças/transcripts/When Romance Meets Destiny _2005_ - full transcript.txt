1997... when a bag of chips was 40 cents... She was a freshman, I was a senior... For someone my age, losing your heart to a 19 year old was a little embarrassing... - Hello Kwangshik. - Hey there. Hi. KWANGSHIK I hid my true feelings for months... But I decided to confess my love through a song during a club trip. That was the trend back then in the 90s... Kwangshik, why did you get up? Are you gonna sing? Well, I thought, maybe... Since I have something to say to everyone, can't you sing afterwards? Sure, whatever. Hey, since you're ready to play... 7 years since I joined this club... Some of you may wonder why a senior like me would tag along... There's a reason why I put up with all your glances and remarks... Kwangshik, slower man... So this is it... I, Yoongyung... I really like Go Yoongyung. - What is this? - What? - Man, you're like a high school kid! - Act your age! Fine! If you have a problem with me and Yoongyung, take me away and kill me. And in my stead, make her the happiest person in the world. One! Two! Three! Let's go! Could there be anything more tragic than that during your 20s? She's born to be slim. - If your boobs... - Hey! - Bro! - What? A machine like this would be cool. You put it over a woman's body, it turns on just like this photometer. Kissing probability, 60%. Fondling, 80%. - Sex, 90%... something like that. - Crazy kid. Don't men get ashamed because they can't read a woman's mind? Why can't they make a machine like that? It would sell really well. Stop hanging out with my brother Kwangtae! Hey, Mr. Peace Keeper. Quick! Peace keeper? What do you mean? - Do you want to know why? - Trash your cigarette in a rental studio. Back in college, there was a very pretty freshman girl in our school club. You know how guys are, - We only paid attention to her. - So what happened? So all the other girls in the club became jealous, and they all decided to quit the club. But this guy bought the other girls lunch, took them to the movies, wrote reports for them... And kept the peace at our club. I heard that back then he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Excuse me, Do you know what your husband did yesterday at his bachelor party? Excuse me? You reek of alcohol. - How much did you drink this time? - I don't remember. Stop drinking and falling asleep at the store. And get rid of that futon bed. What would the customers think? How cool man... Longjohns with the layer of air. You always wear that man. It keeps you seven degrees warmer. I got one for you too so wear it. Got it? Not much use for that, right? When was the last time? Hey, I use it everyday. Every two hours. Pissing aside... Wow, it looks really swollen. Get rid of your dyed hair. It doesn't look good. Jiyoung and Sunmin, switch places please. Good. Kwangsuk! You should be in this picture too! Kwangshik, not Kwangsuk. Kwangshik, join us! No thanks. I'll just take the pictures. You've hurt his pride. I'm sorry Kwangshik. Please come take the picture with us. Boss, I'll take it. Hey look, Yoongyung's here. Thank you. Who, um... Kwangshik. Let's see... Yoongyung, right? Go Yoongyung. How have you been? Oh well, you know... You remembered my name. Yoo Kwangshik, Photo Club member. You don't wear glasses anymore? No. I had Lasik surgery done. I heard that you had gone to America. My whole family emigrated and I came back by myself last year. Now I'm living alone on Ilwon street. I run a photo studio in Jamsil. It's pretty close to Ilwon, no? It can be close but can also be far. Right, Ilwon is a long street, could be far... If I think it's close, I'll stop by sometime. When? A month passed, and she must not have thought that Jamsil was close by. Hello? You wanted passport photos, right? Yes. I didn't even realize that my passport had expired. I wanted to spend Christmas with my family. I have to get this done so I can at least see them on New Year's Day. They could always come and see you in Korea. That's a little hard. I always thought that your photographs were unique back in college. Now, you're taking these kinds of pictures. I guess my taste has changed. I really wanted to learn photography too. - But... - Back in college, I asked you to teach me photography. When? I don't remember that. I thought I did. Are you sure you don't remember? Yes. I usually remember everything. I have a very good memory. You used to live in Boondang. I remember taking the #1005-1 bus to go there. - Forget it! - Mr. Ahn. You were at the wedding last time, right? You were in a navy suit. There are so many people here with good memories. Ilwoong, wait for the photos to finish and bring them later. Yes boss. - How much is it? - Don't worry. Think of it as a Christmas present. But I haven't prepared a present for you. Then, will you take this? It's enough for me. They're Hotchkiss staples. Hotch... staples. Do you know that there are five thousand staples in that box? Five thousand. But no matter how many times you use it you won't use more than 100 staples a year. So since I just bought a box with five thousand staples, I won't buy another one for fifty years. I may never buy staples again in my whole life. But since I gave you half of them today, I may buy another box in twenty-five years when I'm an old woman I'll be able to think of you again then! You'll remember me as the one who made you buy another box of staples before you died. Do you keep in touch with other girls from the club? You were close with many of them. - When was I...? - Back in college, you went out to eat with so many different girls. It was so I could eat with you. And you went to the movies with a different girl each week. It was so I could go with you. This is the couples special. The special Xmas holiday cocktail. This drink will make you so hot, hot she'll say, 'I don't want to go home tonight.' Hope you two have a HOT Christmas! You know, we're not a couple. Do you think you will say that after drinking this? Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you - Is Jesus turning 2004 years old today? - Right, if he is alive right now. Do you know that when Jesus turned 1997, we were together too? Were we? When I was a freshman, a group of us hung out together on Christmas. Oh, that's right. We did. You took me home that night. I did? Shouldn't someone else have taken you home instead? Myungchan drank too much so you took me home. We took the #1005-1 bus. Did I really? Of course. How could I forget? Where is your house? Over there. Sambo Apartment. I'll let you take it from here. Good night. Thank you for coming with me this far. Did you know that I got very nervous then? I wouldn't have it you hadn't come, but you came all the way to Boondang. We were only 200 meters from my house. Well, you know. Hey boss! - How did you find us? - Not many options in this hood. - The photos... - Right. I airbrushed out some of the marks on your face. I didn't think I had a lot of marks on my face. Does my face not take makeup well? Aren't you going back? I don't need your name. There's just one thing I really want. Your phone number. I, I, really want Your phone number. 'As Time Passes By' has been reserved. Your phone number. I really want. Your phone number. Give it away Stop Hey stop, unresistable attraction stop! ASA I saw you, the world have stopped. Just ten minutes, I'm not a bad guy Yo, Come on! Same old, same old story. I don't like it either I won't say anything I am not jealous for anybody I have everything that I need Wow, you're really good. - You should sing one too. - You think so? What a stupid love 'As Time Passes By?has been reserved. Tomorrow seems so far I know the result but I am afraid Any sudden chance could send you away that I haven't heard of 'As Time Passes By' has been cancelled. You promise the future but I promise 'good-bye' I forgot completely that we are together now This stupid love holds me tightly... As Time Passes By You... You asked for a room replacement, right? - Is the big room free now? - Yes! Ilwon street is pretty close. Will you walk me to my door tonight? You know... actually... 7 years ago... when we got off that bus... I drank too much beer that night. I thought I would burst on that bus. When I got off the bus, I knew I couldn't walk you to your door. But I watched you until you went inside. I know. You acted so strange that I got curious. So I turned around while crossing the crosswalk. I know you followed me to my house later. But I didn't turn around because I thought you would be embarrassed. After that day, I thought of you every time I went to the bathroom... every two hours. - We're here. - Right. Kiss her you idiot! Merry Christmas. You too. I'm going. It's this way. Do you like seeing her by yourself? - You like it? - I didn't meet her. - You like it? - Do you think it's her first time? So what if I meet her? - So what if I see her? - Yeah I slept with her. So what if I see her? - Let's meet her together. - What are you doing! - Should we just die like this? - I'll let you die tonight. Please look this way... Man, this is hard. Oh, it's cold. Hmm? Do you want some? - No, it's OK. - Please, have some. We're cold and hungry, and you're offering us chocolate? Well, today is Valentine's Day. You know that girl Yoongyung... She was the girl that all the guys in the club liked, right? Yoongyung? Oh, that Yoongyung? Why? Then you must have liked her too, right? Me? No, she was like a little sister to me. Oh, that's right. You were the club's peace keeper. I wonder when she will come back from America. Didn't she say that she would be back after the holidays? Well now. I wonder when she will be back. She said she wanted to learn photography, so I told her I would teach her. When did you say that? Do you think I had no time to say that? - Oh! I'm so sorry! - Oh, it's OK. When did you two get in yesterday? I couldn't reach you on the phone... Don't get me started. We spent all day in the woods. On Valentine's Day of all days... You slept at the store again yesterday, didn't you? Hey. Some woman told me to give you this. I'm going to the sauna! She didn't have to... I told her not to send it here to the studio. Oh, who could it be? Have some chocolate. You're doing alright. You can have more if you want. Thanks. Not bad. Teach me photography - Yoongyung She wanted to learn photography so I told her I would teach her. You told people not to smoke in the studio. Oh. Do you want more chocolate instead? No thanks. It tastes pretty bad. Well, I told Yoon-gyung to come out. Do you want to have a drink with us? Oh, is she back? Yeah. I told her I wanted to see her and she asked me to bring you. You can see her by yourself. Ilwoong may be young, but he is very mature. He is relatively honest. And his brain works pretty fast. He wasn't even a photography major but after being my assistant for a year, he's better than people who majored in it. Stop saying those things. It looks like someone put you up to it And his father is in the military. A regiment commander, right? A one star! He comes from a good family. So maybe that's why he has good business sense. Wow, all this is just off the top of my head. I think there would be a lot more if we dug deeper. Ilwoong will... teach you photography really well. Even when learning how to shoot pool, it's better to learn from an amateur. Because an amateur can come down to the level of a novice. Oh come on. I shoot pool better than an amateur. How does a guy who always wears longjohns get sick for a week at the end of winter? Can't even hold a spoon. Are you ok with leaving Ilwoong in charge of the studio? At least one of us has to succeed with our stores. People are talking about how those young guys are wasting their parents' insurance money. You don't even know that. You turned your cell phone off again. Hey! Is there something else bothering you besides this cold? You just worry about yourself. Alright. Kwangshik! You are really weird! Yoongyung OK. I'll go see. Where did you say the boiler was? Left at the bottom of the stairs. Good. What is it? What's wrong? How would I know? Do I look like MacGyver? So you aren't MacGyver? Meow! Damn cat! Gotta call the repairman. I can't fix it on my own. But you said we didn't need a repairman. It's cold... What'll I do? We have no choice. I'll just have to become a human boiler... Stop kidding around! I'm starving, you got Ramen? - Boiler is working - Yes, boiler... I told you that he's a humanoid boiler. Don't go to far! Hey big brother... What are you doing here? Nothing. - You're drunk. - I'm not. Yes you are. Hey, what's wrong? Feeling bad? Kwangtae... You know I like shrimp, right? I... And I really like fried rice too. But I can't stand shrimp fried rice at all. Shrimp is good as shrimp. And fried rice is good as fried rice. But shrimp fried rice is a tragic mix! Hey man, I have no idea what you're talking about. Two people I like as individuals are seeing each other. It's a serious relationship. So your shrimp fried rice... this is about them? The same thing happened 7 years ago. So history is repeating itself. So who is the shrimp, and who is the fried rice? Kwangtae! Kwangtae! You little shit! It feels like the film keeps getting cut. That's what happens when you drink. No. My condition is a bit more severe. Did you see the movie Memento? That's like my life. Sometimes, I can't remember anything I said or did when I was drunk. I'm like that too. The promises I make while I'm drinking are forgotten the next day. 'Tomorrow, I will treat my patients with more care.' 'I'll stop going to see those girls at the room salons.' I'll call my sister whom I haven't seen in years.' That's what I think when I drink. But I forget everything when I sober up. That's what alcohol does to you. - How old are you? - Twenty-six. Your liver looks like it's 45 years old. Cut down on your drinking. KWANGTAE In my opinion, the magic number is 12 in male-female relationships. Enjoy your video! Problems always arise after you sleep with her 12 times. Men start to get bored around that time, and women start to get attached. So the point is, the cool thing to do is break up before the 12th time. That might work one or two times, but it's a bother to keep count after the 10th time. I use this method. Every time I make it with a new chick, and get a new card stamped. - You know coffee house coupons? - They only hold 10 stamps. Starbucks only has 10. But Coffee Bin has 12. So I break up cleanly before I get my 12th stamp and that free cup of coffee. Don't forget. Magic number 12. Hey! What the hell? You son of a bitch! Calm down, calm down. This isn't the first time. Calm down! Isn't it that bitch Joo-young? Huh? Is she Joo Young? Damn...! You son of a bitch! Hey! Just keeping living that way! - Didn't you say you broke up with her? - We did. Then what the hell is this? Shit... You slept more than 12 times, right? How can you talk like that in a situation like this? You have to do it right when you break up with a girl. 'The only thing he wants was sex' You can't let them think that. - Just keep your head down. - What you guys doing? She might throw another stone! Jam. Na. Poong. Chung What? You decided later that it never happened? You're just saying that because I can't remember, right? Oh, forget it, you bastard. And hey, hey, hey. Where is the race route? Huh? What? Oh. OK, OK. We'll look at the situation. OK. Right. The house wives marathon club. Yeah, well, just about. OK, OK. Bye. - 4! - 4! - 3! - 3! - 2! - 2! - 1! - 1! You look different from the other runners. I take it this isn't your first time? Who are you? Our eyes met back there while we were stretching! Actually, this is my first marathon. But I'm OK. It isn't so hard. Oh don't worry about me. My heart is pretty strong. Oh, hey. Well... Do you want to have some tea after we finish? If you want to, keep running as you are now. And if you don't want to, tumble three times. OK, OK. Then I'll be waiting for you at the finish line. Don't push yourself so hard. PULL You can just push it lightly. Why do you pull so hard? That's what the sign says. It's a kind of a business contract, no? What are you talking about? Business contract. You should stick to basic rules. Or is your personal rule to break such rules? Every time we went to the sauna together my older brother asks the same question... What are you thinking about these days? Hello, hello. Not her, the one behind her in the pink. No, further behind. Yes, yes, yes. You are number 1972, right? From the marathon. You were number 1972, right? Look out your window. Your window. You see the #705 bus, right? #705. Look here! Over here! Here! Here! Who are you? Come on, from the marathon. Oh, that's right. I had yellow hair back then. - Number 1718? - Yes, yes, that's right. Yes, yes... What? Hey. I'm curious about something. Did you wait for me at the end of the marathon? No. Were you serious back then? Of course not. I was kidding, right. That's good. I was worried about putting someone out... Well then... have a good time! Driver! Stop! I thought about it, and it was just too cruel. - What was cruel? - What if I had really waited? How could you just leave? Huh? I thought you said you were kidding. But you didn't know at the time. Right? Then shouldn't you have at least waited? Huh? Isn't that what a promise is supposed to be? I never said I waited. And because you talked too much, you couldn't finish the race, right? I washed my contact lenses in that water... Lee Gyungjae Artistic, bookbinding... What is this? Just think of it as helping people to read books for a long time. 4 hours and 43 minutes! That's the time of the last runner that day. 10,000 Videos - You want me to bind this? - Yes! Is it no good? It isn't that, but... When I first saw you... I wasn't trying playing around with a one-liner... - Gyungjae? - Yes? Will you slap me on the cheek? What? Slap me on the cheek. Why would I do that? Try it. What could happen? Come on. Since you hit my cheek, I'm going to hit your cheek too. Stop laughing. You're making me feel bad. Why are people here? On Christmas Eve? Stop it. Just watch the movie. Let me go! Come on! I saw this on video already. And who comes to a drive-in to watch a movie? Oh, wait, wait, wait. OK, I'll stop. Gyungjae, just let me touch them each once. Everyone is doing it here. Just once... I'll have to leave if you keep doing this. Come on. What? Is my face a stamp? All you do is put spit on it. Then we won't kiss anymore either. Do you know what I heard about dating in the West? Couples on average sleep together on their third date. Doesn't Korea also belong among developed nations? But we're so far behind them in this area. We should be trying to catch up with them! And that can only happen if people like us can change. That's all you think about when you see me, right? Look. We're still talking as if we don't know each other. That's because there is no progress. - That's why we can't get closer. - Then let's start talking frankly Kwangtae. What the hell? - Weren't you feeding me a scenario - Scenario? When did I? You said you waited for me for two hours after the marathon. So we could have tea! Are you stupid? Did you believe me? Developed nations, developed nation, Korea is, Developed nations, developed nation. Alright... - I'll do it. - Thanks. All I need to do is taking a shower. I am naked, I am naked. Nice longjohns... Oh my God. All because of my brother. Hold on... I'm done, done. All done. I just have to take this off. Forget it. The mood is gone. I can do it. I can revive the mood, all of it, again... - Stop - Were they fake ones? Hey! They can't be imported because of the company bankrupted? They are the best in the market! Are you saying I won't be able to use Japanese apple-flavored condoms anymore? Yes, my heart is breaking. Do not walk through the bumpy road Actually I tried to switch before. I've used it for more than five years. I feel like I'm losing a friend. Do I have to hear this at the start of the new year? How about a new year's resolution? Aren't you supposed to make something like that? Kwangtae! Let's... Let's stop drinking. Wow, you already slept with her five times? It was so hard getting the first stamp. I wish I could start a coupon with someone... - Who is it? - I met her while working at a wedding... She went to school with your brother. If you mess with someone you know, it could get messy later. I don't know... I don't even know when she is coming back from America. I miss her. You don't want to see her. You want to do her. It's not like that with her. Men have two types of feelings for a woman. The feeling below your waist and the feeling above your waist. I think I have feelings above for her. Oh shit, I found it. Japanese fruit flavored condom!! How many guys have you slept with before me? Why do guys always want to know that? Guys? Well, what? What other guys asked you that? Tell me. You're my third. That's what women always say. It's obvious you aren't the first one. And if they say you're second, that's right after the first, too much to bear. So saying you're the third is the safest reply. Anything more makes the girl look too experienced. But hey, that doesn't make sense. Sex is something men and women do together. So their averages should be the same. But when asked? Men always have many more partners. Guys pay for sex. That doesn't count. Truth is, women lie and say a lower number. Then? Do you want me to be honest too? Yes, you know I'm a modern guy. So let's try this method... Is your number closer to a basketball team or a soccer team? - How many on a basketball team? - 5 And 11 on a soccer team? Then it's somewhere in between those two. So... Which team is it closer to? You're really cute... let's go... What are we doing at a motel on Valentine's Day? Fine, forget it. Just forget about the chocolate I got you. What am I, some high school kid? Would I take a present like that from a high school kid? Stop thinking that you have to do something special just because it's Valentine's Day. It's way cooler to spend today like any other day. - You're a real bastard. - So are you! Are you here to take a picture? The guys aren't here right now... Did Kwangshik go somewhere? His phone doesn't work... Yeah, he's on a business trip. Now where was exactly did he go...? Sorry, not sure... Who are you? You could say I'm like his younger sister. Hey, then we must be related. I'm Kwangshik's younger brother, Yoo Kwangtae. Ilwoong's friend Kwangtae? Oh, you must be the one he was waiting for. What? If you like chocolate... Would you like some? Or may not... Will you deliver this for me? - I'm sure Ilwoong will really like it. - No. It's for Kwangshik. For my brother? Not Ilwoong? I didn't have time to prepare one for Ilwoong. - I'll see you next time. - Right...? Have a good night! When did you two get in yesterday? I couldn't reach you on the phone Don't start. We spent all day in the woods, on Valentine's Day of all days... You slept at the store again, right? Hey, where do I put this video 'We Just Got Married? ' In the horror section. Right, the horror section. - Yeah, I took that family photo like an artist. - Good Job. You feel free since Kwangshik isn't here. How is it going with my brother's schoolmate? Nothing bad happened for a week so it can't be too bad! Don't ask. It's driving me nuts. She isn't opening her heart up to me. Then make her open her body up to you first. What's wrong with her? Didn't she give you chocolate for Valentine's Day? That's right. I don't get it... - She lives by herself? - Yeah. Hmm... then go over to her place. And break the boiler. Just take one part out. It should be easy. - And then? - When a boiler breaks, women always call a guy before calling the landlord or the repairman. So you want me to win points by fixing her boiler? Idiot! You can't fix it right away. You'll end up sleeping over that night. - Where did you learn a trick like that - Hey, you bastard. Hey, hey. Going to island for the day and missing the last boat back? It's the same kind of thing She knows what you're doing but she'll go along, if she has even the smallest feelings for you. I'm going. Don't take out a major part of the boiler. It will kill you. That woman is the wife of director Felini. Man, she's ugly. Maybe she's deformed. Oh, I'm sleepy. Hey, lift your butt a little. - I'm trying to wake up. - Just go to sleep then! Oh, it's over. Let's go. Hey, did you cry? Huh? - Let's stop seeing each other! - What are you talking about? Do you know that you only touch me in three places? Three places? Here... here... What's the matter? Huh? I know you want to end this about now too... How can love turn into this? Because it wasn't love. Was it love for you? Why did you meet me? I like to fix old books and preserve them for a long time. And you have a lot of things to be fixed... But I don't want to fix it anymore. So you want to break up? Your coupon is full. Your next cup of coffee is free. Please pick up your drink at the next counter. - Shit! You got stamped! - Yeah, I guess so. Man, you look so happy. I'm ending and you're starting. Good for you! Ilwoong is... yeah... Ilwoong is... yeah. I'm down and out but Ilwoong is... Hey, Who's the shrimp and who's the fried rice? Is it... Ilwoong and that schoolmate of yours? That Yoongyung or whoever? So you're acting like this because of them? Do they know? That you're like this? I doubt it. I never showed my feelings to her... Why not? I don't know. Maybe it's just my character. Just forget about her. They... from today... they got stamped. Let's be strong. Actually, I broke up with someone today too. How does a guy who broke up with someone look completely ok? I'm just made like that, I guess. Hey. Did you ever tell a woman that you loved her? Well you know... at my age... Did you? Well you know... with all the women I've dated... I've never said "I love you" to anyone... Me too... WHEN ROMANCE MEETS DESTINY 3 months later Hey brother... Why did Mom and Dad go to the department store on the day it collapsed? They didn't like shopping too much. Dad liked eating at the department store noodle shop. Damn noodles. Excuse me... Do you have any leftover soju that I could borrow? Sorry, none left. - Well, will one bottle be enough? - Yes. Hey, I was going to drink that. My God. Here you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. What if heaven decides that two people are supposed to be together? But those two people don't know that they are destined to be together. So that woman and I could be fated by heaven to be together... But by accident of fate, these two see each other for the last time... Seeing that, wouldn't Got be frustrated? He would think, I made these two for each other, but they are walking away like idiots. Then I wish He would give some kind of signal. Like now when I gave that woman the soju, I wish a whistle would sound and everything would stop. Then she isn't meant for you. I didn't hear anything. I'm talking hypothetically! To be or not to be, Just like hamlet She really stinks. Why did my brother get worked up over a girl like that? I'm the busiest guy in the world Playing a both ways is hard to do Hey! This is all thanks to you. Something like that! Must see the movie that I saw Must say something sweet that I said Excuse me, sir. - Sir! - Yes? - Where are we? - Sucho street. Did I ask to come here? Hi. What are you doing here? Your hairstyle... really cool. - You're drunk again, aren't you? - A little. - Looks like more than a little. - Really, just a little. So why haven't you worked on the book I gave you? - It's been over six months. - You really wanted me to bind that book? I thought you brought it just as an excuse to meet me. Are you entering another marathon? There sure are a lot of them... Hey, should we do it together? Like last time? You're different from the others... Some tea after the race? Stop it. You're being ridiculous. - If I do it, will you love me? - Why are you like this? Just try to remember tomorrow what you're saying Kwangtae. I will, I will remember. When is it? I'm putting the date in my phone right now. Kwangtae, I'm waiting for someone. So do me a favor and leave. - A guy? - That's none of your business. We just broke up and you're already - inviting men over... - You're really funny. If you're finished, get out! Damn it... Gyungjae, hey! Lee Gyungjae, hey! What are you doing with the lights out! Lee Gyungjae! What are you doing with the lights out! What are you doing? - What does he do? - What do you care? - I'm so curious, it's killing me. - He is a member in my marathon club. You slept with him, right? You haven't yet. Right, you haven't slept with him. A guy comes and leaves... That means you haven't sleep together. But, you're going to, right? - Kwangtae! You're being ridiculous! - Lee Gyungjae! Don't sleep with him! Don't sleep... Ok, I got it... You said it, right? Before you met me... Basketball, soccer team... I get it. I understand, everything... Why am I getting so worked up about you sleeping with someone else? - I don't know. I hate this. - Didn't you want to be cool and end it? Think about the time we spent together. I have no fond memories with you. That's right, Gyungjae and I had no real memories. No special places, no memorable conversations... Just motel, car, motel... That was it. PULL Ilwoong will like it. Kwangshik... It's for Kwangshik... Oh shit. Hey big brother... I have a confession. Last month, I took your credit card and spent $400 at a nightclub. When you see Boss 667 on your statement, know that it was me. And, there's one more thing! But maybe it isn't so bad. It's... Last Valentine's Yoongyung brought a basket of chocolate for you, but I was drunk and gave it to Ilwoong instead. Sounds like an excuse, but my little mistake made things turn out like this... You don't think fate is so easy to break, right? Anyway, I've confessed! So my sin is absolved! Mommy! I've been good since then. Right? Good brother, have compassion! You're a compassionate guy, right? Give me back my $400! Your photos are getting better. - Did you see them? - Yeah. In the dark room. Oh, I told him not to let you see them It's embarrassing... On Valentine's Day... when you gave Ilwoong chocolate... That was really... from what country? I'm not sure. Maybe from the Netherlands? So that's why it tasted so good. That's what they're known for. Finding your soul mate... I think it includes accidents of fate. - Hiddink must be living well back home... - Kwangshik... I want to thank you. For what? For many things. I've heard 'Thank you' from many women. Those words don't hold any passion. They just mean, 'You're a really nice person.' You're a really nice person. I can think of you as a good brother, right? She like me as a brother! I thought of all the girls I've known in my life. I always lost the chance to love them as a man rather than as an older brother. Because it would be like incest... What's this? Here she goes. - What? You bastard! - Hey, man. You're getting married? My father is getting discharged this year. He says one of his kids should get married while he's still in service. Do you think marriage is a joke? - That's how people get married. - What do you know about marriage? Listen, after you sleep with a woman. You wanna leave or want her to. But after you're married, you're gonna wake up with her every morning... Isn't that fuckin scary? Yoongyung's parents went to the U.S. Because their business here failed. She keeps saying that she has to go back because she's worried about them. I can't keep her here just by saying that I love her. That's why... I said we should get married. - Have a drink! - No thanks! From now, you and I won't hang out anymore. From now, you're not part of our club anymore. Got it? What happens when one of us leaves? Kwangtae! It's just you and me now. You're jealous right? Shit, I'm getting drunk. I was just wondering... Do you know... how my brother feels about you? You've noticed, right? Why? Just wondering... Well I'm not stupid, so I had a hunch. But... women can't act on a hunch. I love Ilwoong. 10,000 Videos My brother disappeared to somewhere. Maybe he thought that was the way of keeping the peace. One day, in a dream... I saw him in Iraq in a peace keeper's uniform Kwangshik, be strong! Salute! Marriage/ Kim Ilwoong Ko Yunkyung I'm gonna preside. Eudong, presiding at a wedding is what successful businessmen like myself do. - I passed the civil service exam. - Let's talk again after you pass interview. We request that you turn off your cell phones, or put them on silent mode. But if we hear your phone during the ceremony, members of the special forces here will shoot you on the spot. Groom, please come forward. Bride, please come forward. No matter how strong and great the warriors are on the front lines, without the help from the rear guard, victory will never be achieved. Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much for that. Now, the Army choral group will... Yes, so now... brother! No! Hey man! Even though... you smile at me... - can't hide that tired expression. - Sing a song! Can't hide it. With those sad You turn to look at me. And tired eyes you just look at me. I know it too. Our love ends here Even if we both want it this can't last forever. As time goes by my heart breaks and longs for you Even if we forget remember that our love that our love was more precious than anything. As time goes by my heart breaks and longs for you Even if we forget remember that our love was more precious than anything. More precious than anything. Encore! Encore! Is this fate? No, it isn't. If it's meant to happen, it will happen somehow. I kept her in my heart for seven years... but I never thought anything would really happen between us. Maybe I liked that feeling of missing someone. I guess I liked living on that one-way street. I won't do stupid things like this anymore. Marathon with Gyungjae Hey, what are you doing? Wake up! What's up with you and your brother today? You can take it from here. Me? Pull Push How much would the world change if everyone did what they promised while they were drunk? That drunken promise. I want to keep it this time.
