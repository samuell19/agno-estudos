Adele Karnstein, the hour's arrived. Be strong and have faith. God will save you if you're innocent. There she is, the witch! God, protect us from her evil! Where are her daughters? Witches' daughters are devil's daughters. The young one lives in the castle but no one has ever seen the eldest. Kurt, did you give the order to have the eldest daughter of the witch brought here? Yes, sir. But she can't be found. The search has been impeded because no one knows her at the castle. She has to be tried by divine justice. Like her mother, she's also suspected of being a witch. Grumalda, bring the youngest. Kurt, intensify the search. I want that girl here at the castle today. Who are you and what do you want? - I have to speak with count Humboldt. - Out! No, please. It's a matter of life and death! What's going on? Come here, girl! I'm Helen Rochefort, Adele Karnstein's eldest daughter. Calm yourself. I have little time but I will listen to you. Come. Advise my son and Von Klage: They must wait for me for the trial. What you have told me, it's very disturbing. If Von Klage knew that you were here, he would put you on trial. The woman for whom you're begging mercy is a witch and she killed my brother Franz. No, it's not true. I think I can prove she's innocent. I can tell who killed your brother. It's someone living under your own roof and that you are now protecting. First of all, you accuse one of my household of murder, then me of protecting him. Why won't you reveal the name of the real culprit? If you want me to suspend the trial, you must tell me who it is. - If not, God will judge her. - She's innocent, I swear. Just help me save her. Please, delay the trial for a few days and I'll do anything you ask. What can a man ask of a beautiful woman like you? You heard it yourself: They will wait for me for the trial. I'll order to suspend it. Please, just give me a kiss... a kiss. I'm afraid, give that order. Don't be afraid. Without me they can't proceed. They will wait for me. I'd like you too to... Adele Karnstein, in the name of count Humboldt and of his son Kurt, we accuse you of having brought about, by your evil power and Satan's help, the death of count Franz, their kinsman and lord of this domain. No, it wasn't me! We aren't here to judge you but to rely on a supreme justice. - No, I'm innocent! - Enough! If you are really innocent, God will protect you from fire and restore you to us untouched. But if you're guilty, you'll burn to death. Human judgment is fallible but God's judgment never is. Elisabeth Karnstein, if your mother is saved, innocence shall prevail. If she's guilty, the weight of her sins will never re?ect upon you. Adele, if you're guilty, look for the last time upon your daughter. - Mother! - Lisabeth... Take her away from here! Start the ritual! Let the judgment of God begin for the greater glory of God. She has climbed onto the stake by herself. That proves she's guilty. I'm innocent. Oh Lord, you know I'm not guilty of this crime. Forgive all my sins. Humboldt! You will pay for this with your life! Let me go! I curse you and your descendants! Your bodies will be tortured like mine has been tortured today. I will haunt you to your grave! My curse shall be upon you! You murderer! I'll accuse you of adultery and send you to death! A pestilence shall befall you. Mothers shall see their children die, and husbands their wives. Humboldt! I will haunt you wherever you are, you cursed! You will not escape my vengeance! My curse will be on you and your son! And you, Kurt! You will suffer this death of mine on the last day of this century! Helen, remember that your mother died innocent. You must avenge me because they destroyed my body and soul. My soul will never rest until Humboldt and Kurt have paid with their lives. Remember... at the end of this century... No! You murderer! Now our secret is safe. Lisabeth. Come with me. Listen, Lisabeth... This is very important. I know that you should think about just playing at your age but you have seen your mother burned to death. And your eyes are still filled with horror. Lisabeth... I think that... if you one day... Lisabeth... I secretly collected your mother's ashes. Now she rests in peace over there along with the body of a woman found drowned under the waterfall. This is our secret, you are not to tell it to anyone else. So now you know where you can pray for your mother in your moments of greatest despair. Lisabeth... are you listening to me? Do you understand? Leave me alone! Don't touch me! Have you noticed her face? As each day passes, she grows more and more like that witch. What's odd about that? She's her daughter. Just as she predicted, pestilence is spreading in our domain by the end of this century. - And she will come to take me away. - What are you so afraid of... if your soul is cleared from sin? Your mind is tormented, Humboldt. Yes, yes... It's just that her face constantly reminds me of that witch... What matters isn't the resemblance of the face but that of the spirit. Up till now Lisabeth has not forgone her obligations to you. This is what is destroying you, Humboldt. Why do you keep hanging around Lisabeth? I commanded you're never to speak with her. Stop, please. I'm not a baby now. And I'm very tired of... being 'forbidden'. Until I'm alive, you will do as you're told because it's me who give orders here! Only the fact that you're my father prevents my helping you join your brother. You are like him, you'd even be able to disinherit me. Just the same as he did. - How did you learn of that? - I heard everything! You begged of him that his will was in my favor but he refused. Then he was accused by you of being Adele's lover. My poor Franz... I'm sure I could have convinced him eventually had he not died at the hands of that witch. You've been blind to everything. I killed him. I poisoned him that very night. It's me you should thank for everything you have and that one day will be mine. I thought you knew it and accused Adele to divert suspicion from me. You killed Franz... Go away! Get out of here, you murderer! Have pity on me... Forgive me... I'm responsible for your death, Franz, and that of Adele Karnstein. I sent her to the stake with the accusation of killing you. I beg you, I can never hope for her pardon, so I'm asking you for yours. No... no! No... You'll be mine whether you like it or not. Leave me alone! You're drunk. Don't you ever do a thing like that to me again. Leave me alone or I'll call for help. You know well that Von Klage is very severe. He's the one who rules here, not you and your father. Lisabeth, I swear by the devil that I will have you whatever it costs. I intend to marry Lisabeth. You're mad, mad! How can you ask such a thing? Are you really in love with the girl? I'm going to marry her. Why do you oppose it? For this could well be appeasing to her mother's spirit. Yes, you're right... It might be the answer. In the name of God... I unite you with the sacred chains of matrimony till death do you part. There are many people dying like ?ies in the streets, shouldn't you recite an exorcism? May you be spared from the scourge of plague! Both from the one that disfigures the body and from the one that ravages the souls. Amen. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. You're my wife, Lisabeth. You haven't possessed me yet. What if I should refuse? You can't refuse, I'm your master. I hate you. I always get what I want. Now you're mine. You're repulsive. I felt your body trembling, you had a thrill of pleasure. I managed to make you mine. No, Kurt, I'm not yours because I'm not in love with you. You've had my body but not my soul. I will never be completely yours. I'll make you regret those words. He's dead! He's dead! You can't take him away! I won't let you! Go away! I'm infected too! No, you can't take him away! To the square, there's two more dead! Let's go to the castle and we'll be safe! The plague has not penetrated those walls yet. To the castle! 31th December 1499. The plague continues to rage on. The countryside is littered with fires and the roads with dead. Kurt... you must do something. People are trying to attack and force the castle gates. Our soldiers will keep them away. Don't worry. - Are you afraid? - No. I'm not afraid of death. I expected this day to come eventually. My mother predicted it, or had you forgotten? Open the gates, in the name of God! - We want to get in! - Go away! Open it. Open the... open... Father... I'm dying... I don't want to die... I don't want to die... Father! Von Klage is reciting the Apocalypse in the chapel. We are all there. Come along. Mother, I know you must be avenged. But I can't hate him, Kurt is my husband. I can't succeed without your help. I beg you, don't leave me alone. I can't do it. - Father, what is it? - I feel death coming. "Then the Angel opened the 6th seal and the whole Earth trembled. The sun turned black... The moon became the color of blood and a great rumbling was heard throughout the land." Humboldt, you will pay for this with your life! With your life! Lord God, forgive my sins and return my soul to peace. Amen. "And when the Angel opened the 7th seal there was a great celestial silence." It's raining! It's raining! The rain will save us from the plague! Oh, Lord! Thank you, God. The plague is over! It's over! God, please, save us! "And on the Day of Judgment the dead will return to life." Humboldt, I curse you and your son! He will also know my vengeance! No! Go away! Father... This is the ring count Franz wore when he was buried. That's odd... - How are you feeling today? - I'm fine, thank you. - Can I do something for you? - You've already done too much for me. I still cannot understand... It all happened at once... Don't you remember what happened? No... I can recall the carriage overturning, and that I came here looking for help, that's all. You looked like you were mad with terror. You fainted in the doorway of the chapel. Where are you from? And where are you going to? I traveled very far. Lam looking for my father. Or at least for what is left of him. My name's Mary. It would be best if you remained here. The countryside is still scattered with fires and people are mad with fear. No, I must leave at once. The domain of Brazville is very far away. Your journey will be dangerous. The countryside is swarming with raiders. A risk that I will have to take. Please, stay. I beg you. Count Kurt, my husband. If the plague hadn't taken many of my soldiers, I would offer you an escort to accompany you to your destination. We might also send a message on ahead that your friends can dispatch some soldiers to escort you. You will have to excuse us. We're holding a requiem in honor of count Humboldt. He died yesterday. Were you related? My father. I'm so sorry. I would prefer you won't leave at once. I must go. Who will deliver the message to Brazville? You can give it to Von Klage. Tomorrow he will get a man there. May he rest in peace, amen. Do you feel at ease here? Yes, thank you. You are all so wonderfully kind. I beg of you to stay awhile. Since your arrival I've known a happiness that I have long forgotten. I feel as though I have suddenly been awakened. It has been a beautiful experience for me too. Why did you do that? I love you, Mary. I want you to be mine. Yes, I'd like that too but I can't do it because adultery is punishable by death. If Von Klage knew it, it'd be the end for both of us. Grumalda, since that woman arrived. Kurt has changed. He's keeping me at a distance. You don't have any more time to lose. You have to confront him, talk to him. I'll try. Assuming he doesn't behave as usual at night. He no longer comes to my room. You should knock first. You're acting as if I were your mistress. I'm your wife, don't you forget it. And that torment it causes reminding me of that. This is your way of taking revenge on me. And what should I take revenge for? That you forced me to marry you? No, you're wrong. You don't really need much time to get used to certain things. And you often end up taking pleasure in them. Now, even if I had the intention, I wouldn't permit you to treat me like an old shoe. Kurt, I won't let you have that woman. Don't be a liar. You know well who I'm talking about. I'm not afraid of you. She will be mine just like you were mine. Just lay a finger on her, and you'll regret it. Not now, Lisabeth. Don't kill him now. It's not the right time yet. I must go away. I won't let you leave here. It's pointless going on. What do you mean? - What about your wife? - I hate her. The fact she exists is an obstacle to our happiness. Stop, Kurt. What do you want to do? Edmond. Here is the message. - Ride fast. - Yes, sir. Did you inform Kurt of your departure? Well, the count did ask me if I was leaving for Brazville. When I said yes he wanted me to give him the message but I said I didn't have it with me. That message must be delivered to count Meister as quick as possible. Here. A drop of it will help you on your way. Thank you, sir. Any news of Edmond? Who, the servant? No, nothing. Don't worry about him, he's very capable. He has only been gone two days. He'll probably arrive with the escort. If I were you, I wouldn't wait for him. May I ask why? Grumalda, tell us what you know. He was poisoned. His body was found in the woods. The innocent's blood will fall upon his murderer. Amen. Kurt! I had to poison him to prevent him getting your message through. What? How could you push it that far? Tell me it isn't true. I'll do anything to keep you. You're mad, Kurt. Besides, I'm going. Too late. Tonight I will kill Lisabeth. Don't count on me. I won't be guilty of such a crime. We shouldn't have done it. But now that we got this far, we have to act coolly. No one would suspect anything. They'll think she died naturally in her sleep. The poison leaves traces but if you are suffocated by your own breath... Then nobody can accuse us. We'll be able to live together for always. - For always. - Yes, for always. Stay here. I'll go. No, don't leave me alone. Calm down. We're upset over nothing. No, there was a shadow, I saw it well. No... Here, quickly! Who's there? What do you want? I couldn't sleep so I climbed to the top of the tower. I wanted to get some fresh air. Suddenly I heard voices in the corridor so I came down to see who was there. You didn't hear voices outside? No. You scared me coming in here. I didn't want to wake you, that's why I didn't knock. Now you can go back to bed. Good night. Good night. Thank you. But there's no time to lose. It'll soon be finished. Come. Now lock the gate and put the key back in the latch. Then if anyone comes, there won't be anything suspicious. Be careful! Quick, give me the sealing wax. Damn! - What do we do now? - Come on. There must be another way out of here. It's Lisabeth's room. We couldn't have been luckier. This will make it much easier to get her back here. Mary... Mary. It's time to be going. Are you ready? I hope it will soon be over. She's dead. I'll come back later. What is it? Anybody would think you've just seen a ghost. - Who were you talking to? - Your wife. - Is she all right? - She was fine a while ago. And she seemed to have... a good appetite. - What is it? - She's not there. She went away. She will accuse us. Get in. You are so easily panicked, like a child. And what's more, by a servant. But Grumalda told me... She told you what she wanted you to believe. Lisabeth's dead. You saw her yourself, she was cold and breathless. Grumalda too saw her. Grumalda discovered everything and now she wants to blackmail us. So we're going to satisfy her. It won't be the end of the world offering that hag some money. Old people suffer from all kind of ailments, they can die any moment. It's stained with blood. Oh, is that you, sir? What happened? First I heard footsteps and then the door upstairs, so I came down to investigate. Have you seen anyone? You may think me mad but in past nights I've heard some funny things. - What do you mean? - It's difficult to say. It's like as if there's something around here but... when I come to look for it it's completely disappeared. What about just now? Didn't you see anyone? There was a shadow. I hid myself to attack it, but it was you instead. Go look in the garden, I'll go upstairs. Your wife was in the chapel, Kurt. She begged me to ask your pardon but she's not feeling very well and will rather eat dinner in her room. What's wrong? Don't worry, I'm just a little... distracted. If I had known it before, I would have joined her. Why don't you join her in her room? You might take her dinner to her, wives are pleased by such attentions. You don't need to stand on ceremony for me. By the way, Kurt... I have something to tell you. I've been thinking it's your responsibility as a vassal to announce a celebration for the passing of the plague. In this way we will also celebrate the end of the century. - Do you agree? - May I go and see to your wife? Yes, I'll go see her later. You haven't answered me yet. Yes, I agree. It's a marvelous idea. I think we should have a real symbolic representation. Everyone will participate and lift a prayer of thanksgiving. You will get help from baron Von Lest, he's a man of intelligence. It's a wonderful idea, indeed. I hope everyone can participate in all serenity. Lisabeth has assured me of her participation.Will you be there? With great pleasure. I wouldn't miss it for anything. Please, excuse me. I have to inspect a list of tributes. Your wife is very tired, she's sleeping. She begged me to tell you that she doesn't want to be disturbed. Good night. It's a conspiracy. Von Klage... he also wants to take the power in the domain. Now he sees this is his chance and he doesn't want to miss it. That's why he planned the celebration. He will assemble the people and the notables and then accuse me in front of everyone. If what you say it's true, then it's the end for both of us. We wouldn't stand a chance. Perhaps we should leave. And lose it all to Von Klage? Is that what you want? No, I'll never leave it to that schemer. Every time I think of Lisabeth I lose control of my senses. She's the cause of all our troubles. I curse the day she was brought to this castle. No, go away! I don't want you! Kurt... Kurt, can you hear me? I'm Mary. Calm down, sir, you had only a bad dream. No... it was her. I saw her. Quiet! We can leave now. Let him sleep. "From Adele Karnstein I had a daughter who I recognize as my heir. She was given the name of Lisabeth. In the event of my death, I order she is brought up at the castle and appoint my brother Humboldt as her guardian until the age of 18. Signed: Franz Martin Weil." Lisabeth! Lisabeth! - Mary! - Kurt! Mary... what are you doing here? I heard a rustling, it was rhythmical, nagging... it's hard to explain. See there what is it? Let's get away from here or I should go mad. Our Lord has spared our lives. We must thank Him for His infinite mercy. This symbol of evil will burn tonight. And your hair will burn with it. With this gesture we will mortify even the smallest of our sins, that is... man's preoccupation with vanity. Who is it? Who is it? The celebration is ready to proceed. We're only waiting for you. Go away! Go away, you all! Go to hell! I don't want to see anyone. Get out of here! Enough! Mary, tonight... you're more beautiful than ever. You must go down. Or your absence will arouse suspicions. Suspicions? Von Klage knows and so do all the others! I'm sure he concocted everything to make us responsible in front of everyone. Do you regret the things you did to make me yours? No, I swear it. You're worth any risk. Quick, get ready. I agree, Mary. I'll be down in a while and we'll confront them together. This is a pleasure, my lord. I hope all is to your satisfaction. But I can't see count Kurt and his wife. They'll be here shortly, don't worry. You know what it meant not seeing someone in the past months... The plague is finished, baron Von Lest. There's count Kurt. My lord. - It's good to have you here. - The pleasure's all mine - Thank you. Come. Milady... Stay away from me. They could become suspicious with your wife's not here. I can't keep away. I can't help it. Look out! - Where is your wife? - She's unwell. I don't think she will be down in the garden. Your Lord. Your wife asked me to give it to you. Good evening. Bring me something to drink. Don't act foolishly! Let us all go to the garden. Go with two men and bring the effigy here. And be sure the scythe is put in place. - Yes, your Lord. - Well, it won't be long now. I've just seen your wife. She's more beautiful than ever. Where did you see her? Where? In the courtyard. What's wrong with him? Lisabeth! Lisabeth, please stop... Stop! You're dead, Lisabeth. You're dead! Lisabeth... You can't be here... you're dead. No, Kurt, I'm alive. It can't be true... I killed you. Death doesn't reinstate life. No one can return from eternal rest. Leave me alone! Whose on earth is this body? That's my body. Death can sometimes reinstate life. But it's not like that with Lisabeth as she's not yet dead. But I was allowed to for appeasing my soul and avenge our mother. I'm Helen Karnstein, the eldest daughter of Adele. I'm her stepsister. You hoped I had helped you kill her. Now you will succumb to your own crimes and scheming. And what did you all that for? For that poor body. Look inside that casket, Kurt. Come on, look at the woman you reserved your embraces to. But I... Go, Lisabeth! Take me away with you. You must keep on living. You can't escape your fate. No one can. So your revenge is not over yet? Get me out of here! Leave me alone! You won't escape. You're going to meet your fate, Kurt. No, get me out of here! Just go, I will not stop you. Leave me alone! You're free, Kurt. Get out, you can go. Go away, 90 away! Kurt Sebastian Weil, the time has come. Have strength... and faith. God will save you if you're innocent. I didn't think death could be so heavy! Sometimes a plague would be a good help to laugh behind these lords' back. The effigy is a symbol of death. And they are taunting it because death failed to snatch them. But it can be dangerous to taunt death. No, you've said it right: It's just a game. - Have you seen Kurt? - No. - Maybe he went upstairs to his wife. - Maybe. I can't move. I can't speak. I can't cry out my terror. They're going to kill me. I'm doomed to a terrible death. My gagged mouth can't utter a sound. We would be very pleased that your gentle hand could set fire to the pyre. Here's womanly beauty and grace destroying death and terror. My mind is crowded with vague and terrible memories of my past. Frightening images... an unbearable nightmare. Whereas it is the bright memory of a horrible reality experienced hour after hour. The morbid moments of the most reprehensible and dishonorable passions, of the most shameful seductions. Today the burning memory of those embraces makes me tremble with anguish. I wouldn't do it, Kurt... even though you tried to kill me. I don't want to die! But remember what happened to my mother! I don't want to die!
