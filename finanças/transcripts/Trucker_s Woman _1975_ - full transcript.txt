* I pulled in exit 52, just around the bend * Know I'm coming home to you * Exit 52 * Made a run to up a load * I usually take my time * But knowing what's just waitin' on me * (brakes squeal) * In a couple of miles, I'll be turning off on exit 52 (brakes screeching) (engine roaring) * Exit 52 * Left you on a sunny day * All night having fun (brakes screeching) (glass breaking) * The only thing I had on my mind * Was making love to you * I have two days driving * And two speeding tickets there in exit 52 * Exit 52, you know I'm coming home to you * Exit 52 * Exit 52 * Exit 52 (church bell rings) - [Voiceover] Although it is a time of deepest sorrow, we know that your long-time associate and deeply respected friend, Jim Kelly, has gone to his eternal reward. To his son, Mike Kelly, we extend our heartfelt sympathies. We wish him well as he chooses to continue now in the same business venture as was his father's. Jim Kelly, you have served us well on this earth. We now commend your spirit to our Father in heaven. May your soul and the souls of all the faithfully parted, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen. (church bell rings) - You know, I hate to say this, but I think Jim would be sort of disappointed in us, not having a good ol' fashioned Irish wake for him. - Maybe so. - Plus, the other fellows are all on the road and you couldn't expect them all to be here, anyway. - No, I suppose not. - Just the same, I don't see why those bigwigs from Midtown Terminal couldn't have showed up. Those low-down... - What's the matter, buddy? What's eatin' you? - Nothing, except your father did such a damn good job of serving the terminal. They think a basket of flowers can make up for it. - What do you mean? Make up for what? - Oh, nothing. Just forget it, just forget it. Come on, let's go, huh? * I'll hit the road again * And I'll hit this one more gig * And I'll push this big gas pedal to the floor * No girl can make me wait * If I don't believe I'll be late * And I got to get this load on up the road * Well I just got back from Philly * And I think it's kind of silly * How they're sending me back truckin' all alone * They make 'em swim in Richmond * And it might be hard to discipline * To make it to the Mason-Dixon line * I'm just a foot-mashin', gear jammin' * Trucker named Kelly * Movin' my big rig along the line * I'm just a foot-mashin', gear jammin' * Trucker named Kelly (blows horn) (blows horn harder) (engine roars) (country music) - What'll you have? - Coffee - sweet and brunette. Just like you, honey. * You'll wake up and she'll feel the pillow for me * He'll look at the clock that's on the stand * She'll rub the sleep from her eyes like a child * Hi there. - Hi. - The name's Kelly, ma'am. Mike Kelly. You know, say, for a little ol' gal, you sure can handle those wheels you're drivin'. - Oh, you, um... Must be the driver of that truck, hmm? - Yep. Mind if I join you? - What if I say no? - Well, being the gentleman I am, I might question that a bit. In a nice way, you understand. - Okay, on one condition. - Name it. - Please don't call me "a little ol' gal". - Okay. I can buy that. What should I call you then? - My name's Karen. - Fine, Karen. You got a deal. You can call me Mike. - You old man. You kook! - Excuse me a minute, Karen. Hey now, take it easy! He didn't mean anything by it. Everybody's entitled to one mistake, eh? - Okay, stud. He made his, you made yours. Now don't put your nose in my business again. (intimidating music) - Wouldn't you know it? No sooner do I meet a good lookin' chic like you and some bum comes along and makes me look like a redneck truck driver. - I don't know. I think that was very gallant of you, saving an old man from a beating like that. - Ah, now you're making fun of me. - No. But I am curious about something. - What's that? - You just don't strike me like a typical truck driver. Is trucking a sideline or a hobby with you? - Well, I probably coulda been teaching in some high school or another one day, but my old man had an accident, I had to drop out of college. But I got my own rig now. And if I make enough money, maybe I can get back on the intellectual grind someday. - See? I knew there was something different about you. - Hmm. - It's a pity we have to call it off so soon. - Call it off? What do you mean? We're just getting to know each other. - Sorry, I've got to be going. - Well was it something I said? At least let me impress you with my knowledge of some of the better eating spots in this area. - You know, Kelly? I could probably learn to like you. In due time. - Well, hold on now. At least let me walk you to your car. Okay, old timer? Come on, pa, get up here. That's right. That's right. That's... Easy, take it easy. Well, wise guy. Now you've made your one mistake. How'd you like to try that on me? - Okay, stud. I can proudly kill you. (intense music) (groaning) - Hey, Karen, hold on a minute! Sure wish you didn't have to cut out so soon. - Ah, I think I'd better. The cops should be arriving any minute now after that little get together inside. Hey, I think you'd want to be getting out of here yourself. - Yeah, you've got a point there. I'm sorry about that. - It's okay. You restored my faith in chivalry. - But I was sure hoping we'd get to know each other, just a little bit better. - You know, that thought crossed my mind, too, Kelly. But that's the way it goes. - Well, hey, where can I look you up? - Who knows? If you're a good little boy, maybe I'll look you up. So long, Kelly. (engine roars) (horns honking) (light upbeat music) (knock on the door) (knock on the door) Okay, okay. Hold your horses! I'm coming. Who is it? - [Voiceover] Kelly. - Kelly? What the hell are you doing here? - Well didn't you say you wanted to get better acquainted? - [Karen] Yeah, but... - Come on, why don't you open the door and let a fellow in? - [Karen] Oh no, I know what you've got on your mind. You're not gettin' in here! - Oh, come on, quit acting like a kid and let me in. - Not until hell freezes over. I've heard about you truck drivers and your women. For your information, I'm no truck stop woman, you hear me? And I'm gonna call the manager if you don't get the hell out of here. And I mean it! Well? You leaving, Kelly? Kelly, dammit, I know you're out there. Kelly? Hey! Put me down, Kelly! Put me... You better put me down, Kelly. I thought you said you were a gentleman. I'll call the manager! Oh no, Kelly. I'll scream so loud, it'll wake up everybody in the motel. - Now, now, now, now. We wouldn't want that to happen now. And you're right. We wouldn't want to give us truck drivers a bad reputation. Oh, actually though, Karen. We're not like that at all. - You aren't? - No ma'am, no ma'am. We're actually very, very considerate and gentle and compassionate and soft-spoken and subtle. - Subtle? - Yeah. Like this. (romantic orchestra music) (birds chirping) Hey, Karen! When we get to Springdale, I got a couple friends I'd like you to meet. - Sorry to disappoint you Kelly, but I may not be going to Springdale. - What do you mean you might not be going? Can't just skip out of my life like that. - You know what your trouble is, Kelly? You got your ego in the wrong place. - Now hold on just a minute. - Sorry, but I gotta be going! - Hey! (engine roars) Hey, Karen. You're not going to drive off like this without telling me who you are. - [Karen] No... I'm gonna drive off and leave you like this. (laughs) - You know, George? I thought I saw a streaker. - Oh, Ethel. (phone rings) - Yeah? Yes, sir, Mr. Fontaine. Right, sure. Yeah, I just sent a load to them this morning. They ought to get it in a couple of days. Why are they coming down here? Sure, it's all right with me. Fine, sir. Just give me a call and I'll come right out. - Did you here about the frustrated dog? He couldn't get his down up. * That's my home on the range Hey, gently will you put this in the cab? Thanks. - Hey, Ben, how's it going? - Oh, about the same. How was your trip? - Oh, pretty tiring, but otherwise all right. Say, Diesel Joe... I got some trouble with my electrical system. You think you can do something for me? - Sure. - Okay, well you know where it is. Here, Fred. Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? I thought by now you'd be loaded and gone. - Well, I should be. But let me show you something. Two of Fontaine's drivers got there ahead of me. Same thing as usual. And, hell, they just come in last night. - Come on, Ben. (knock on the door) Frankie, we want to know how the hell Simmons and Andrews got to the top of the list on the trip board. - Maybe it's their turn out. - Ben tells me they just got in last night. And now they're being loaded up to go out again? How long do you think we're gonna put up with this crap? - Look, Kelly, you're starting to sound like your ol' man. Now if you don't like the way we do business around here, why don't you do your hauling somewhere else? - You know, Frankie? You might have a pretty good idea there. We just might do that. Come on, Ben. Let's get the hell out of here. - That bossy comic. If I didn't need the work, I'd a jam that clipboard right down his throat. - Come on, buddy, now. Take it easy, relax. - Eh, I know. I know that every time I talk to that jerk, he gets my balls into an uproar. - Ah, just take it easy. You'll live longer. - Ah, all right, all right. Hey, how about going to the club for dinner tonight, huh? I could stand a change of scenery. - Yeah, well that's the best offer I've had today. But, first, I want to go down again and take a look at my dad's truck. - Oh look, Mike, I feel the same as you do, but do you think you should be going down there every time you get back into town? - I just can't help it. I gotta find out what caused that accident. I know that if I just keep on nosying around, I'll find out. - All right. Okay, I'll see you later, huh? - Okay, buddy. (birds chirping) * Take my hand * And put it into yours * And we'll walk away together * Out among the flowers and trees * Hello, buddy. - Hi, Mike. How'd it go? - Eh, not too good. I need to know what I was looking for and it's pretty much of a mess down there. But I still don't believe my dad's death was an accident, so... He was just too smart for that. By the way, listen. When I got back from college, you started talking to me about Frankie and my old man and we never really got around to it. - Nah, nah, you're right. But you gotta remember that everything I say is strictly my own opinion. I think that Frankie knows a lot more about that accident than is on the police report. Because he and Jim never got along at all. - I know, I know. Say, what about that plan that my dad had that had a whole new terminal set up? - I believe it was a lot of illegal freight being trucked to and from that terminal. And Jim had caught on to it. That's why he wanted to go out and take the independents with him. - You think that stuff is still going through here? - All I can say is there's a lot of Fontaine's trucks that are going out to unknown destinations. - Well, what do you think we ought to do about it? - Well, Mike, that's sort of up to you. You see... All the boys really looked up to your father. They would have done anything for him. And I think you're the only one that can pick up where he left off. - Are you telling me that these truckers would jump at the chance to start a whole new terminal of their own? - Yeah, sure, I believe they would. - Okay. Well, if you think these guys will listen, you can get them all together and I'll talk to them. That is, if they will listen to a newcomer like myself. - They'll listen. (overlapping chatter) - Something funny going on out here, boss. That Kelly kid and Ben Turner having some kind of meeting. All the independent drivers are here. - Tell you what you do. You call a couple of the other boys and have them meet me down there as soon as possible. - Okay, boss. - All right, now we all know we're not gonna get any fair deals from Fontaine and Frankie. And there are a lot of other things going on down there at that terminal that I don't think any of you fellows want anything to do with. So, now my ol' man came up with a plan explaining what to do and he had it printed up. Now I think we ought to go along with what Jim said... And set up our own terminal. Now that way, we're all gonna get a fair deal. (chattering) (foreboding music) - I understand you and the other boys are having a little meeting? - [Ben] So what? - You wouldn't be trying to start some more trouble for us like your old man did, now, would you? - You know, Frankie, I'm glad you brought that up. I've been meaning to ask you where were you the night my old man got killed? - Now what's that supposed to mean? - It means I never have thought my old man's death was an accident. - You know, Kelly... If I were you, I don't believe I'd be saying things I couldn't prove. - Got one word of advice for you, Frankie. You better hope the day never comes when I can prove it. (anxious music) You got me all loaded out and ready to go? - Sure, you're really loaded this time. - All right. What's my first stop? - Here's your weight bill. - Mmm-hmm. Okay. See you in a few days. - Yeah? Good. (engine roars) (slow anxious music) - Get me the warehouse on the phone. Never mind, I'll do it. Frankie? Jake Fontaine here. Yeah. What did you find out about last night? Oh. That again? Who's got 'em all riled up this time? Kelly's boy, huh? Well... He gets too loud, you're gonna have to do something about it. Good. Good. By the way, you know you have to be over here at noon. Those Synicka people are gonna be here from upstate for a meeting. And Frankie... Bring me a copy of that information Kelly is circulating. (upbeat country music) - What seems to be the trouble, officer? - [Officer] Routine spot check. You carrying any cargo? - Sure am, just got loaded up about half an hour ago. - [Officer] I'll have to ask you to step down. Let me see your weight bill and your operator's license, please. - Okay. Make it fast, though, will you? Got a long way to ride. - Lieutenant! This looks like the one. - Well, Mr. Kelly... I'm afraid I'm gonna have to put you under arrest and take you down to headquarters. - Headquarters? What for? - Mr. Kelly, you're carrying stolen goods. - You're crazy! - I would like at this time to inform you of your constitutional rights. You have the right to remain silent. (phone rings) - McDonald. Already? Yeah, what'd you get? Good. Yeah. Who's the driver? Where was he out at? What do you mean Jim Kelly's boy? Hell, that can't be right. Something's not copacetic. You booked him yet? Well don't, he's been set up. Yeah, where you got him? Okay. Hello, Kelly. - Hello, Lieutenant. Would you mind telling me why your people dragged me down here? - You had a chance to call your attorney yet? - Attorney? I never needed an attorney before and I don't need one now. - Eh, suit yourself. But you were caught hauling stolen goods. - Ah, don't give me that bullshit, Lieutenant. You know me better than that. - Maybe. But what was that stuff doing on your truck? - How the hell do I know? I don't load the damn thing! - All right, Kelly, all right, calm down now. Look, how do you think that freight got on your truck? - How do I... Well I'll tell you Lieutenant. I think a colony of little ants had nothing to do in their spare time, so they kind of just had a conference and sneaked -- - Okay, Kelly, okay. If that's the way you want it, I'm gonna tell it to you just like it is. Now look. You may not know it, but you could be in a lot of trouble. Now, both you and I know that somebody set you up. But it don't matter a damn what you and I think, it's what the court thinks! - Hell, don't you have any pull around here, Lieutenant? Can't you fix it? - It's not that simple. They caught you hauling illegal freight. For all they know, you put it on there. - Like hell I did! - Okay, Kelly. Maybe I can help ya. But you're gonna have to help me. - Meaning what? - It's simple. I'll go to bat for you, if you'll do some other cover work for me. - Oh no, no. You got people that you pay to be informers. That's not in my bag. - Okay, Kelly. I hope you know a damn good lawyer. 'Cause you're gonna need it. Book Mike Kelly. - Hold on, Lieutenant. - You change your mind already? - Well, let's just say I'm willing to consider it. What's the deal? - Kelly, for a long time now, we've been suspecting that stolen goods have been transported through Midtown Terminal. But suspecting and proving are two different things. - Well, how do I fit in? - Well, Kelly, what we need to know is when that warehouse is full of hijacked freight and, if possible, where it came from and where it's going. - Look, Lieutenant, if they're doing what you say, then they're not gonna let me just sneak in there and start nosying around. Besides, Ben Turner and myself are trying to organize the independents to start our own terminal. Now what am I supposed to tell Ben? - You're a bright boy! You ought to be able to figure out something. Now, Kelly, what we've talked about goes no further than this room. Understand? - Thanks, Lieutenant. Now how the hell do I get out of here? - (sighs) Well, I'm gonna go down and get the judge to set bond for you. And, before the case comes up, I'll have the charges drop. That is, if you cooperate. - Okay, okay. Can I go now? - Yeah, you can go. Oh, Kelly. - Hmm? - Keep your pants zipped. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Frankie is with Fontaine out there? Well what is Fontaine's address? Ah, come on now, sugar. You owe me a little favor now, remember? Well of course it's in the ritzy district, where else? Yeah, that's it. Uh-huh. All right, thanks doll. No, not tonight sweetheart. I've got a real long run to make and I... I won't be back for a couple, maybe three days. But I'll tell you what I will do. Soon as I get back, I'll give you a call and we'll have one of our swingin' times. (laughs) You're a doll. Yeah, but listen honey. I really appreciate this. Bye-bye. (engine roars) - Okay, take care of it. - Uh, like I was saying, Mr. Fontaine, I hated to lose that freight, but that was the only way to take care of that Kelly bum. - You think it'll work, huh? - I'll almost stake my life on it, Mr. -- - Almost? - Uh, that's just an expression. (fast suspenseful music) (groaning in pain) - Who the hell do you think you are? Get that damn rig off my lawn before I call the cops. - Why you old goat. If it weren't for your age, I'd belt you one. On second thought... - Bravo! Bravo! I see you've taken to beating up old men yourself now, Kelly. - What the hell are you doing here? - You just can't believe it, can you? - You mean you and him? - Mm-hmm. My daddy. - Now I get it. Wouldn't tell me your last name, huh? Thought I wouldn't have anything to do with you if I knew. - You wouldn't dare. Kelly, put me down! - [Kelly] Like father, like daughter. - [Karen] Kelly! - I'm warning you, Jake. Next time you try to set me up, you won't get off so easy. - What the hell is going on around here? I thought you told me you'd taken care of him? - I thought I had, Mr. Fontaine. I don't understand how he got out so soon. - Well you better quit fooling around and do something about it before he gets us in more trouble. And, in the meantime, if I was you, I wouldn't let him come back to the terminal, either. - Look, Mr. Fontaine, if we try to keep Kelly out, we're only looking for trouble from the other drivers. The only thing I know how to do now is to let him have an accident, just like his old man. - Okay, but make sure you don't botch up the job this time. - No wonder you guys ain't gettin' any good stuff. You let these punks push you around. That had happened up north... He'd be wearing some over shoes now. - Doesn't happen that often. - Eh, enough of that. The boss wants us to tell ya, he ain't happy with the cheap goods you been sending up there. We need better stuff. And more of it. (engine roars) (country music) - [Voiceover] Boy, look at the chassy on that. (laughs) Bassy chassy. I sure would like to finance that. - Buster, you couldn't finance the front or rear bumper on this chassy. Get on back to your table. * Said we're just going where you're going * Life reaching for the sky * I need a real good woman * To make love, gonna getcha by * - Couldn't get here any sooner. Whatcha got? (giggling) - My girls tell me they got a couple truckloads of colored TV sets. - How long they been here? - At least half an hour, I suppose. - Get rid of 'em. * She tells me that she loves me * And I have two golden birds - All right guys, time to get out. Come on. - What's going on here? - Time to move it. Come on. Now! Come on, get out of here. Beat it, now. No, we've got a place of business to run. Now get out. - News, girls. - [Waitress] Now! (inaudible conversation) - Let's go. (engine roars) (water trickling) - As soon as that stuff's transferred, put that truck in the river. Take the railroad outta here and Smokey won't see ya. But keep your CBs turned on. And don't leave any tracks around here. - Yeah, yeah, boss. (country music) - Just coffee, sweetheart. - Mike Kelly. - Maggie! (laughs) - Mike, you look more like yourself than the last time I saw ya. - Yeah, you look a hundred times better. - You coming or going? - No, I'm just getting on back in. Got loaded about a half hour ago. - From the looks of you, I'd say you could use something stronger than coffee. - Maybe. What do you got in mind? - (laughs) Come on. (slow romantic music) Something bothering you, Kelly? You don't seem like your old self. - No. It's nothing. - Am I boring you? Would you rather I just left? - (sighs) No, it's not you. It's personal. - Is she that important to you? - Yeah. How'd you know it was a "she"? - We women know these things. - Hmm. - You want to talk it over? - No, I don't think so. - Listen, Kelly. If I cared about someone... Cared that much... It'd take a lot to keep me from them. Go after her. It gets real lonely out there. (horn honks) - I got your note, Lieutenant. - [Lieutenant] That's obvious. What the hell took you so long? You shacked up somewhere? - Aw, Lieutenant. - Come on, let's get going. What the hell's a big idea going out to Jake Fontaine's yesterday morning? - What are you getting at, Lieutenant? - Ah, come on, Kelly, dammit. Don't play dumb with me. I know you went out there yesterday and beat up on Fontaine and three of his men. You even threw his daughter in the pool. What the hell you trying to do? Clear the whole deal? - Oh, no, it was personal. - Personal? Look, I don't give a damn what you call it, but you're no good to me unless you're hauling freight out of Midtown Terminal. - Well then I'm no good to you anymore. Because I don't haul out of Midtown, anymore. - The hell you don't! We got a deal. You're going right back in there and behave yourself, just like always. You understand? - You really mean that, don't you? - Damn right, I do. Got those charges dropped. - Man, when you got a guy with a hairy short, you sure know how to put the squeeze on him. - Hi, Joe. You putting the chi boss on some poor trucker's rig? - The way you monkeys tool these things down the road, you'd think they last forever. - I'm just checkin', that's all. I want to be sure you know the difference between a solenoid and a thurgood stroker. - What? - The thurgood striker, where it's attached to the batton valve down there. - Yeah, sure. - See, I knew you knew your business. - You damn bet ya. I'm the best they got around here. Old man Fontaine would have gotten somebody better a long time ago. - That's right, Diesel Joe, you're the best. And I want you to know those guys really appreciate you. Too bad ol' Jim Kelly isn't around anymore to appreciate you, too. - Yeah. - That's what the guys were saying the other night. Too bad about ol' Jim. You know, he was the best friend I ever had in a business. And I was wondering, since you're such a whiz on these machines, do you mind figuring out what caused his accident? - I don't know nothing! What are you trying to say? - Oh, uh... Well, Mike's been going down to the wreck almost every day and it just dawned on me that you're the only one ever worked on Jim's truck. I hear you been throwing an awful lot of money around lately, Joe. - Don't you go accuse me of nothin'. I ain't had nothing to do with Jim Kelly's accident. - I never said you did. But you sure got awful nervous all of a sudden. - You best get out of here, old man, before I bust your skull! - Okay, I'm going, I'm going. But if I was you, I'd get me some good answers to what I was doing on the old man's truck the day of the accident. - Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Flaming Pit. I'm Alan Mitch Miller and I'll be your host for the entire evening. And right now, for your listening and dancing pleasure, how about a nice big hand for Peggy Linville and the Castaways. (applause) * Come and share the sun with me * It's all I have to give you * But it's mine and it's free * Come and chase the gentle beams in the eve * For one day, the sun may no longer be there. * I'm sitting here, remembering a boy I used to know * Though we parted long, long ago * I can see his smiling eyes, kinda sad but very wise * Looking through my memories * Saying what he said to me * Come and share the sun with me * It's all I have to give you * But it's mine and it's free - You know, it just isn't like Diesel Joe to go into a rage and threaten me like he did. Mike, the more I think about it, the more I think that he had something to do with Jim's accident or knows an awful lot about it. - Well, now that you got him shook up, it might be a good time for me to talk to him. If he knows anything, I might be able to get it out of him now. Say, how you doing signing up those drivers who weren't at the meeting the other night? - Not bad at all. Signed up four more. And that puts us over the 20 mark. - Say, that's great. With that many, it shouldn't be long before we'll be in business for ourselves. And then we'll show Fontaine how a legitimate operation should be run. - Yeah, even if we go broke trying, huh? Say, I have to get up real early for a run tomorrow and us old timers need our beauty sleep. All night, that is. See you later, huh? - All right, ol' buddy. * Everything but love can be * Is mine because you shared the sun with me * Come and share the sun with me * It's all I have to give you - Hello, Mr. Kelly. How'd you like to buy a girl a drink to make up for throwing her in the pool? - Well, I might, but I really don't know you, do I, lady? - Oh, come on, Mike. Don't be sore. Look, I don't know what's wrong between you and Jake, but believe me, I've had nothing to do with it. Honest. It's not my fault. Mind if I sit down? - Suit yourself. If you're telling the truth, why didn't you want me to know who you were? - Well maybe I didn't know if I ever wanted to see you again or not. - Then what are you doing here? - Dammit, Mike! You can't blame me for something I don't know anything about. If you want to act like a jackass, be one. So long! - Hey, Karen. Come on, wait a minute. - What do you want? - Move over. - The hell I will, what do you want? - I said move over! - Now what? - Now we'll go get that drink you said I promised you. Never let it be said that Mike Kelly ever refused an offer from a lady. - I'm afraid you're a little late this time. - What do you mean? - Haven't you heard? I can't go anywhere without daddy's watchdogs following me. I'm afraid he won't be too happy when he finds out I've been out with you tonight, Kelly. - Now that's just too bad! (engine revs) (fast country music) (brakes screech) (horn honking continuously) (cows mooing) (phone rings) - Yeah. Oh, boy! You lunkheads! Oh, let me think. He's got an apartment at 331 Ridgeway. Now nothing's got to happen to the old man's daughter, understand? All right. - Well now, ma'am. (glasses clink) Here's that little drink I owe ya. - Hmm, I'll tell you what. After a ride like that, I sure could use one. (slow romantic music) You know, Kelly, I just can't figure you out. - Well why keep trying to figure me out? Why not just admit you're crazy about me? - Uh-oh, here comes that ego again. (sighs) I think I'm the crazy one, Kelly. I think I'm falling in love with you. (birds chirping) - Well, a good, good morning to you. You mind? I have to take the lady where she wants to go. Gee, I guess I forgot to say please. - See? You have no manners! (laughs) - Please? Please! (fast chasing music) (tires squeal) (train bell dings) (tires screech) - [Voiceover] Unit 15.

(fast chasing music continues) (train whistle blows) (police siren wails) (train whistle blows) (police siren wails) (train horn blows) police radio chatter) - Karen, I want to talk to you! Where the hell have you been all night? - What are you asking me for? That's what you pay your watchdogs for, isn't it? - Don't get smart with me! You were out with Kelly all night, weren't you? - Sure, I was out with him. So what? - I told you not to have anything to do with him. - Daddy, you've told me how to dress, where to go to school, what to eat almost all my life. Now you're gonna tell me who I can go out with? - You're damn right! And no daughter of mine is associating with a truck driving clod! - You know, daddy? I'm beginning to believe some of the things that Kelly and the other fellows have been saying about you. You really want to control everything and everybody around you no matter what, don't you? - Karen, don't you get smart with me. (gasps) Karen, you come back here, I'm not done with you yet. (crying) Look, baby. All I want to do is tell you how sorry I am about what happened. - You, sorry? - Sure, I'm sorry. It's just that I was worried about you when you didn't come home all night. And then the boys told me that you were out with Kelly. Naturally, it upset me. I lost my temper, I guess. You know how much I love you and I'm really sorry. - Oh, daddy. I wish I could believe that. - You're all I've got. Can't you understand why I want to protect you? - Protect me? All you're trying to do is control me. - You've got it all wrong, baby. And matter of fact, when you get down to it, I really don't have that much against Kelly. He's just a stubborn young man who doesn't know his way around life yet. So as long as you're going to keep seeing him, why don't you try and get him to see things our way? - I don't know, daddy. I just don't know. - Look, baby. I've got to go down to the terminal for a while. Why don't you rest and think about what I said and we'll talk about it later? - Maybe. - Frankie! I want to talk to you inside. - [Frankie] Morning, Mr. Fontaine. - I want to know what you're doing about that hot-headed Mike Kelly. - Well I haven't had a chance to do anything about him yet, Mr. Fontaine. - Well you better take care of him immediately. - Why, is something wrong? Is he bothering you again? - He's not only interfering in my business, now he's in my private life and I want him stopped. - Permanently? - Permanently. - All right, Mr. Fontaine. I'll take care of him today. - Good. In the meantime, what I wanted to talk to you over the phone was those two Syndaca men are going to be here tonight with the pay-off for last month's shipments. I want you to make sure it's right and bring it to me as soon as they leave. - Yes sir, Mr. Fontaine. Tell Diesel Joe to come and see me. (suspenseful music) (engine starts) (foreboding music) (tires screech) (tires screech) (tires screech) (dog barking) - [Kelly] Hey, how are ya? - What can I do for you, Mac? - Say, name's Kelly. Uh, I got my rig down the road a little ways and it's got some stripped out fittings and some damaged cylinders. Think you might be able to do something for me? - Nah. Been working on this here rig here for three days. Got one been sitting over there for two. Seems like I'm gonna be tied up for a while. Sorry about that, Mac. - Uh, do you think somebody else around here might be able to help me? - No, I... Don't rightly think so. - Say, uh, is that pickup over there yours? - No. Matter of fact, I hadn't thought of that. Some guy named Joe drove it in a little while ago. He said he was some kind of a mechanic. - He didn't happen to say his name was Diesel Joe, did he? - Yeah. Joe Diesel, something like that. - Where'd he go? - Last time I saw him, he got a bottle out of his truck there and went on inside. - Well, thanks, Mike. - Don't mention it. (chattering) - Where's Diesel Joe, Buck? - Sorry, Kelly, can't help you, I don't know. - Now, listen, don't give me a hard time. I know he's here, just tell me where he is. - Okay, okay, hold on, Kelly. Number two. - All right. How long's he been here? - Since about noon. Bouncing with a broad. (anticipatory music) - Joe! Open up in there. Joe! Open up! - Gee, honey. If I'd known you'd been so handsome, you wouldn't have had to burst the door down. I would have let you in. - Get out of here, honey. Split! - What the hell? Kelly, how'd the hell you get here? - Listen, I'm beginning to put the pieces together. I got a couple of questions and I think you know the answers. - I ain't answering any questions from you! (fast music) Stop him, he's trying to kill me! Buck, stop it! - What's going on here? - Diesel Joe helped kill my ol' man. - You mean Jim Kelly? - Yeah. Is this thing loaded? - Sure, what do you think I do? Hit him in the head with it? (screams in pain) (gun shoots) - I've got one more left here. That's enough to blow the top of your head off. Now, who paid you to jimmy my brakes? - Listen, don't kill me! Frankie did. Frankie paid me. - Did Frankie pay you to kill my ol' man? - No one was supposed to get hurt. He just wanted to scare him. I swear, Kelly, I swear. Don't kill me! Please don't kill me. Please! - Get up. Get in that truck. You're gonna drive me to town. - [Diesel Joe] What about my leg? - That's your problem, man! Get in that truck. - All right, all right. Boys, boys, boys! Tiny just called, Trendy called, and Mike Kelly's got the goods on Fontaine. And he's headed now for Midtown Terminal. Are we gonna let him go all by himself? (overlapping chatter) All right, follow my rig. Come on! - You can tell your boss he's got a grade A shipment of refrigerators headed his way. - Hmm, that's fine. Don't you want to count the money? - We'll even up if we have to make adjustments. - Whatever happened to that punk... Kelly? - Oh, by now he must have had an accident, just like his old man, you know what I mean? (laughs) (clears throat) (tires screech) (intense music) - Frankie! Frankie! - Remember, I thought you said you took care of that dude. - I don't know what went wrong, but it won't happen this time. - [Voiceover] Hey, let's go! Come on, let's go. (overlapping talking) (yelling) (yells in pain) (groans) (gun shoots) (gun shoots) (yells) (sirens wail) (yelling) (slow calculated music) (engine roaring) (gun shots) (engine roars) (groaning) - Take it easy, Mike. You'll kill him. - Mike, you hurt? - Sure I'm hurt. What do you expect with all that lead flying around in there? - Yeah, we'll take care of that for you. You okay, otherwise? - Yeah, I guess so. Look, you'll find all those stolen freezers and TV sets in section E back there. I guess that should wrap it up for ya. - Yeah, except for one pleasant chore. (anxious music) (cheering and applause) - [Ben] Hi. - Well, things will be different now that Karen's the new boss. And you'll be in charge of the office. All the drivers, even Fontaine's, will get a fair shake now. - Yeah, but you know it should be you and Karen up there running the terminal instead of -- - Ah, no! You know me. I got too many places to go and things to see before I settle down to a desk job. Well, we got these wheels rollin'. Ah, where is Karen, by the way? - She said she'd be right back, she had an errand to run. - Oh. Tell her I'll see her when I get back. - Take it easy now. - Okay, you bet. (engine roars) - [Voiceover] Whew! - What the hell are you doing back there? - Hello, Kelly. - Don't you know that now you're the boss, you can't do things like this? - Oh, come on, Kelly. Isn't it okay if the boss checks up on the drivers once in a while? Hey, what are you stopping here for? We've got a long ride ahead. - I know it. - Okay, let's get movin'. - I'm bushed. - This early in the day? - I can always muster up enough strength for an emergency. - This is no emergency. - Oh, it wouldn't be if you hadn't sneaked on board, sexy. - Now, Kelly, you're not getting any silly ideas, are you? - I can feel something developing. - That ego again? - Well, I wouldn't object if you'd want to step out a moment, excuse yourself. Freshen up a little bit. Put on some of that sweet smellin' stuff for me. - Okay, lover boy. I'll be right back. Don't get started without me. - Who, me? And miss all the fun and games? (engine roars) - Kelly! Kelly, what in the hell are you doing? Kelly, you dirty liar, come back here! Kelly, you're fired! Kelly! * I'm just a foot-mashin', gear jammin' * Trucker named Kelly * Pulling my big rig along the line * I'm just a foot-mashin', gear jammin' * Trucker named Kelly * Somewhere up the road I'll leave that sweet lovin' * Warm-huggin', soft-kissin' woman I call mine *
