Delicious mother. - What about the father? - No, it's mostly the mother. - Is he out there too? - Yes, they keep watch. - I just wanna pee. - It's the other way. - Have we not seen each other ...? - Talk to your hand, roof fire. - In stereo. - And surround sound. Remember to get your mother out of there. Just do it now. The toilet is in the entrance hall. Uh, there is one, who has thrown up on the carpet. Oh no, not again. And then there was just ... Pardon? That, oh ... Phillip Eberfrø! At your service. I got a whole shock. I should have just suffered. - What are you doing there? - It is your card. Ho-ho, platinum card. Yeah, just that was mine. You have to get up there a little more a month, I think. Don't you call Phillip Eber seed? Yes, but with a Swedish island. And I change name here to the first. My numerologist has suggested Sysmund Pejderhagl. There is so much written about him toy giant. The card is probably his. Then you have to go over Hamburger Rice Allé. - Aren't you Sunes little brother? - Yeah. Cardboard. So greet your stepfather. He's still the knot, - - Because I did not grant municipalities support for his Nixi Dixi dolls. - Do you want a food? - Yes, why not? Ouch! No, I'm just gonna ... Nice to meet you. It lacks pesto.

Otherwise, I thought you were like that a little rolling with a ninety doll. No, no, it's just a gift for my cousin. - You're a little sweet, you are. - You can be that yourself. - Shall we Dance? - Uh, yes, clearly. I just have to pee. - Are you waiting here? - Yes Yes. Yes! - Don't dance now, right? - Yeah. Man, I helped you, and you promised to help me. - Not right in the middle of the party. - Fuck the party, this is important! - Jessica ... - Flush that bag!

You don't have to sound like I'm couldn't breathe without you. - It was totally cool, man. - Especially when he flew through the air. - There he is. Wild fight, Ash. - You hadn't seen it come. - Especially that kung-fu at last. - It was something I found myself. - Fat, man. Six, Ash. - Yes, we are seen in there. Well, can you do it yourself? So clear it here! No! Wait! Sorry. (Askes voice) Help, I've peeed in the pants! No, it's not ... Off! (Askes voice) Now I'm going to fuck too! No no! I just want to emphasize ... (Askes voice) Jessica, it's me, Ash. I don't want to dance anyway. You are under my standard. What? I'm a bit of an overcoring for you. You have to settle for Odysseus. What? (Toilet flushing) - Are you an overscoring? - No, no, I haven't ... Am I below your standard? What did you say with that that you had pissed in the pants? No, it was the ninja. It's all due to my ninjada doll. So my cousin's. Jessica ... See you, overscoring. - Odysseus, shall we sneak? - Now I'm just thinking about it. Yes please! - Come home. - Odysseus? The lady will sneak. If not I do That is, there is just another who does. Well, did you dance? What are you doing? I had promised to help you. - I need your help now. - So why are you crushing my life? Sorry I went over the line. It's just important, this one. How can that be short mean life or death? It's a nating. An honor story. Human, if you help me now, I'll probably do everything well again. - Do you promise? - Trust on me. Okay. I just have a hard time seeing, how Jessica will be good again. It was also some strange thing to do tell her. Lets go! - Can't he lie to sleep? - One may well hope. Came. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm a secret. Came. Don't call. He hates when calling. - Lucky he has a cat. - A big cat. Are you afraid of big cats? (heavy snoring) You think this is okay? He gets wildly happy about getting the card again. - Can't we just put it to him? - I want to make sure he's here. - Piss. I think he's out. - One suitcase. Maybe he is traveling. Because there is a suitcase here? Are you related to Glenn? - Maybe should travel. - We just have to find out. Bingo! (Snarl) - What did you say? - There are bingo! (Growling) - A plane ticket to Thailand. - He must visit his slave factory. - Can you see when he travels? - What is this going on? (Toilet flushing) I don't pay a penny, if not, it's okay. Yes, we look at it out there. It is well. We see you. Was there anything, basse? Hello? Anyone here? Hello? - Now I have you! - What the hell? - Stop! - Let go of me!

Save me! - It was good, you came. - What happens, Mr Eberfrø? - They throw with knives. - We go up and check out. Block the door quickly. - May I have an explanation! - Shouldn't we get away first? What is this going on? It has not a skid with the card to do. Phillip Eberfrø is evil. He killed a boy. And he uses child slaves to make his toys. - Do you want to kill him or what? - Something in that style. Did you see the flight times? Remember them. And take the collar. - So from that one? - Yes, unless you have one yourself. It's called Bingo. - So help me! - Here, just behind the ear. - It's the guard! Close up! - I just need clothes. What are you doing? We turn in the door! Give me the collar. Grab. Come on, besides. What? I can't. Bingo! There is a blast! That's how, bingo! (barking and screaming) (Sirens) - It's you, right? Taiko Kamakura. - Nakamura. - You took advantage of me. - You promised to help me. By submitting a card, not to kill people. - He killed a little boy. - And now you want to kill him? It's called justice! - And what about the other children's slaves? - That kind of thing happens all the time. Well then everything is in beautiful order. Just tell me when he is flying. No. I do not want something to do with it. (sword being pulled) Say it! No. Do what you want. I'm done. Man, I can't kill you. We've been through too much. But maybe it is easier for me with ... ...
