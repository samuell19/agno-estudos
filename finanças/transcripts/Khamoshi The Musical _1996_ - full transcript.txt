Timings by Bluerain_20 Joseph, you look very happy today. Your daughter is coming? Son-in-law too! It's good. Very good. SILENCE an album by... Annie and Raj. "Let it go." "Let it go." "Let it go." "Let it go." "Life's so sweet, isn't it?" "The spring of our love's here. So, celebrate." "Hey, friends, sing and dance." "Come, let's have some fun." "Let your hair down." "Enjoy. We've no sorrows." "Let it go." "Let it, let it go." "Let it go. Leave it." "Let it go." "Let it go." "Let it go." "Let it go." Annie... car... an accident! Can't say anything for 24 hours. But there is hope if she comes to in the meantime. She will be kept under observation. Sister, have one more Nexamethazone injection ready. Today while death is so close... I can see through my whole life. An absolute and rich life... which we all lived. Always lived together... through thick and thin. Joseph! Joseph! It's a girl. And, there began.. ..an impossible dream. If my papa could call me by my name once. I saw this dream the day I was born. But life is meaningless... without an impossible dream. Joseph! Yes, my son! She can hear. She can hear! There is rhythm in her voice! This house has got voice after so many years. After many years! My sweet child! My birth brought new beginning of voice in my parent's life. In their silent life... even the sound of my cries was a source of joy for them. Mariamma used to say that... At the time of my birth I cried in rhythm of shells. So I was christened Annie. Annie Joseph Briganza. Our house was full of silence as well as sounds. Mariamma introduced me the rhythm hidden in it. Noise of waves. No... the rhythm. Since childhood my life had divided in two different worlds. On one side there was the silence of my parent's life... And on the other side there was Mariamma's music. "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Sing and the whole world will sing with you." "Sing along." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Sing along with me, the world will sing with us." "Sing along." "The heart beats with every tune." "And flames erupt, with every breath." "The heart beats with every tune." "And flames erupt, with every breath." "Silence seems to have spoken today." "The eyes get moist." "It's like rain without clouds." "Sing along." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Sing along with me, the world will sing with us." "Sing along." "Then, someday, he'll take you away." "A prince will come and lift your veil." "Then someday, he'll take you away." "A prince will come and lift your veil." "You'll blossom into a beautiful maiden." "And your life will be like the season of spring." "Sing along." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Listen to the notes of the season." "Listen to what the air around sings." "Sing and the whole world will sing with you." "Sing along." "Sing along." Did you sell the soap? Don't worry. We stole two fish. For eating. Annie. Stealing? This is not stealing. Everybody does it in childhood. It's just a play. This is not stealing. Do fishermen ask the sea before taking the fishes? Is it wrong? Then what is right? Is it right if children sleep hungry? No! Papa! Please! What are you doing? Listen to me! No, Papa! No! You couldn't sell soap so you're taking it out on children. Damn the people. Do people feed your hungry children? You have not been disgraced. One day your daughter will become your voice. Remember this! I am the wife of a freedom fighter. What did we get after independence? Only this house. But they didn't realise we needed food also. Your father didn't give his life for the sake of truth. He gave up his life because he couldn't face the truth. What's the truth? The truth is that he died because of you. You are deaf and dumb. He couldn't stand the truth. So he died there. Did you hear me? Did you! We are from Super clean factory It's new product of our factory. Three rupees for one piece Two pieces for five. It's gentle to your hands too. We are from Super clean factory. This is a new product of our factory. You... We are from Super clean factory. It's a new product. Please give us one more chance. Two for three rupees, one for five. Wrong! One for 3, 2 for five. Correct? We are from Super clean factory. This soap will be kind to your hands too along with your clothes. Please give one more chance. If you use it once, you'll want to buy it again and again. One for three, two for five. Only three packets! You sold only three packets in ten days? Enough! No more business with you. You are fired. We do work hard but people don't understand. What can we do? Give us one more chance. You are not worth a second chance. You've always been fired from every employment. The only alternative left for you is begging. Hey, girlie! Tell him. I pitied you because you were deaf. You take this little girl with you on work. You don't understand what she says. Neither can you explain anything to people, and you want another chance! He has got no choice but begging. Take this money as alms and get out of here. I don't want to see your faces again. Help me! Papa, please don't do it! I took sympathy for this mute and now he is beating me! The deaf is beating me! Let him go, guys He can do nothing to me! I took pity on this bloody deaf! No, Papa, please don't. Someone please help me, he's going to kill me. Suddenly I felt grown up to see my father's helplessness. I began to understand why I couldn't steal fish even for a game. We are different. People don't understand us. No! Mom, No! Please, No! Mama, please don't kill it! Please! Eventually the music vanished from our life... and silence was everywhere. Papa was jobless and we parted away from our dear things. Come on! Be careful. This side please. Please keep it straight. Watch it, man! It's very delicate. I watched my piano being taken away. I was parting from a dear friend. I felt as if it was urging me to stop it. It wanted to be with me. Don't cry, my child. What parts away comes back sooner or later. Remember this. Listen! Music is alive as long as our heart goes on ticking. Now, not just us.. ..but the whole world will sing with our piano. "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "We would sing alone before." "But the whole world sings today." "What a joyous moment. Shun your tears and smile." "Smile with love." "Forget the past." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Why grieve over what's lost?" "Isn't what we have not enough?" "It's good, right? It's the truth, right?" "Music's on and the whole world dances." "Smile with love." "Forget the past." "We would sing alone before." "But the whole world sings today." "What a joyous moment. Shun your tears and smile." "Smile with love." "Forget the past." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "We've heard that.." "..what goes, does return." "It's good, right? It's the truth, right?" "The whole world is dancing to our tunes." "Smile with love." "Forget the past." "We would sing alone before." "But the whole world sings today." "What a joyous moment. Shun your tears and smile." "Smile with love." "Forget the past." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." "Let's take this away with pomp and splendour." "Watch your step." Mariamma passed away. But her memories were always with me. I can still hear her songs. Her song's became my strength. It was my guiding light throughout my life. It guided me in difficult times. Thank you. Thank you, Mother Mariamma. Come on, children. Willy became our friend. Because of him there was piano in our life once again. Happiness was returning in our life. You see, this is how it is played. Papa was working in a toy factory, where even an ordinary pipe seemed a bugle to us children. You scared me! Now this box will sing. I don't believe this box can sing. By God it can! You are joking, right? You don't believe too? No! Why? Mummy says never listen to people who can hear and speak. Ain't I your friend, Willy? I never tell lies. Just a minute. Put it here like this. And here it goes. Really! It is indeed singing. What if we fix it in our parent's throats? Will they be able to speak? No. It cannot be fixed in any body's throat. It can sing other's voices. One day it will sing our Annie's songs. Remember this! It is going to happen one day. Sam! Sam! Mom is calling for prayer. I won't come. You go! Come down! Sam! Sam! Mom! Papa! Mummy, Papa. Papa, papa Sam, Sam! Come on, hurry up. That day... I heard papa's silent cries for the first time in my life. I never forgot those cries. The cries of helplessness. And anger towards God. There was sadness in our house after this incident. I was lonely. Mummy and Papa kicked God out of their life. They had only one hope, Only one truth. And that was me! They lost faith in God. But I was sure God would come back in our house. "Ask my heart what's in these eyes." "Let me find out what's behind the face." "Ask my heart what's in these eyes." "Let me find out what's behind the face." "In spite of her silence, her face gives away her true feelings." "Ask my heart what's in these eyes." "Watch, she'll now set her tresses right." "Her scarf will fall due to the breeze." "Watch, she'll now set her tresses right." "Her scarf will fall due to the breeze." "And then, suddenly, she'll turn back and see." "Ask my heart what's in these eyes." "Let me find out what's behind the face." "Ask my heart what's in these eyes." PLEASE SING NO SAD SONG FOR ME. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, no! Please stay still. If you leave, my music will be incomplete. Thank you. Just for a few minutes. It's over. Would you like to hear my music? Just think. A beautiful girl went in a light house... with this tune on her lips. Her voice was full of magic. People used to come to hear her voice from far off places. And her voice became popular in the whole world. The flute comes at this note. Flowers would blossom at her voice. Even the impossible would become possible. It would seem like all the seasons had joined hands. And her voice reached such heights... that no one could ever imagine. The whole world sang with her. When she would sing, everything else would stop. It would take people's sorrows away. The whole world was mesmerised. And then suddenly... she stopped singing. Why? No one knows. There was no answer to people's questions. Something will be always be amiss in my life till I get back that voice. So tell me, what do you think about this tune? Like it? Thank you. Hang on... thank you. See! Mariamma also wants you to stay here. Weather is so pleasant. I can do anything in such weather. For example, I can guess your name. Auntie Sophia... No? Khatima... No? Usha Dai... No? Then? Annie. Annie! Annie... You look very beautiful when you laugh. You look very ugly. Thank you very much, Mariamma. A nice tune indeed Where did you hear it? It's the voice of my heart. I've composed it for a very pretty girl. Oh, I see! Willy? Yes. You can sell this piano now. No, my son. I will not sell this piano. Tell me some thing.. if this piano were very dear to you, a memento of somebody's love... or somebody's possession... Would you have sold it? God bless you. There you are! You always leave your shop unattended. Accounts are ready. There were so many mistakes. Mistakes can be corrected. You go now. I will come soon. Don't take too long. Yeah, yeah, I am coming. What's this, Willy Uncle. You've even left the piano open! You know what... Your voice is more beautiful than you. You must be wondering as to why I'm here. I came to buy this piano. But now I know, this piano is very dear to somebody. Now you must be thinking about the goings-on of my mind. I'm thinking that how will I be able to go away... after being so close to you. Today I am very happy. Because I have heard your voice. I have found the voice I have been looking for. You still have this with you? Uncle Willy has still been keeping this safely. You remember Sam and I used to hear it? And how we used to dance! Papa, shall we dance? Please, Papa. Just once. Yeah! One, two, three and... turn. Mummy, do join us. Mummy. Mummy! Stop. Mummy's sewing machine is making too much noise. Papa! Just a minute. Mummy! Mummy. Please stop it for a while, the music... Mama, look at me. Can't you stop it for a while? But why? Why can't you stop it? Is it very urgent? What difference would it make if you were to stop this for a while? Mummy! But why? Why do you hate music so? Why doesn't Mama listen... Father, I have a confession to make. Speak, my child. For the first time in my life, I yelled at my parents. I love them too much. I didn't even think once what would happen to them. They have nobody except me. And I know this very well. If you feel sorry, God will definitely forgive you. Father, I'm very afraid. I feel that there is a whole new world out there beckoning me, if I step into it, I will be away from my parents. That world is full of happiness. But I don't want such happiness which I can't share with my parents. Whenever I hear the sound of waves... I hear music, I hear a song... Whispering of leaves. I feel like I am committing a sin. Annie, I cannot understand your sin. Music is a God given gift. It's not a sin. Whatever you want to confess, say it frankly. Father, these days I am being attracted towards somebody. So, this is the problem! Who is this boy? Is he from our village? No, he is an outsider. What is his name? I don't know. You don't know even his name and you're getting so upset! Father, actually l... Just a moment. Father, I have to speak to you. Wait for some time a confession is in progress. There seem to be more sinners than priests, I guess. Am I right? Right. Good. So, some sinners must wait. Right? Me a sinner! Sorry, my child. Ok, tell me where did you meet this guy. In the cemetery. Cemetery?! If it would have been a funeral then I must have been present there. No. I just went there... Without any reason, to the graveyard? And then? Then he met me in Willy's shop. I just happen to meet him so suddenly every time. Just like that! It seems as if he is present here too, somewhere. Just a minute. Sorry for the disturbance. Can't you wait even for a while? Have you heard about something called patience? No. No? Anyway, tell me what do you have to say. I have to confess something. I know. You didn't obviously come here for a cup of tea! No? You are here to confess a sin. - No. No? I came to confess my love. Father, how can meeting a lovely girl be termed as a Sin? And that too, in the graveyard. In the graveyard? According to me it would have been by the grace of God. She happens to meet me suddenly. Everywhere. All of a sudden, anywhere! Yes, when I lift up my eyes, I find her there. On the way when I turn back, I find her in front of me. When I see her I wish her scarf to fly away. It does fly. Right. I go in a shop and find her playing my tune on the piano. In Willy's shop. Right, Father. It's truly a miracle. Of course, It is. When did you meet her? Three days ago. Since then I have been very excited. I know nothing about him. Except that he composes music. I know nothing about her. Except her name. Annie. What! Do you know her? Oh Father, you are not father, you are a grandfather! I must touch your feet. Go back in the confession stand. Sorry, I got a little excited. Love isn't impatience. It's not meant for only enjoyment, it's not a sin either. It is an enduring sorrow, and patience. Can you do it for our Annie. Father, I love Annie immensely. I can do anything for her. Good. She is here. This thing did cross my mind. Go and express your love. "My darling, I'm crazy about you." "I love you." "Love, my lovely maiden, is no crime." "For love is worship." "So, come on, let's burn our hearts in love." "May it never be extinguished." "This is our destination. Come, don't go anywhere." "No matter where you go, you have to come back here." "This heart is the destination of your heart." "My darling, I'm crazy about you." "I love you." "Let's meet in a way." "That even the Lord above will be pleased." "I met." - "We met." "You." - "You." "The Lord." - "The Lord." "Will smile." - "Will smile." "So, come, let's burn our hearts in love." "May it never be extinguished." "Let's burn our hearts in love." "May it never be extinguished." "Let's burn our hearts in love." "My darling, I'm crazy about you." "I love you." I am mad at you. Why didn't you tell me... that you had been promoted? Even then... at least you should have told me and Mummy. Sun? It gives light to whole universe. And yet speaks nothing. Papa, I am very happy. I am proud of you. How do you feel? Papa, we ought to celebrate. We will indeed. We will buy a car later, first of all I want a red dress with frills. Papa, listen to me. I need a new dress. I want to look beautiful in the coming carnival. Papa, please. You've always worn clothes sewn by mom. But I won't let it happen to me Mom will listen to me. First I will talk about promotion. Mom will be very happy. Then, I will tell her about the new dress. It's a bet. If I lose, you give me nine punches. Alright, but if I win I will give you nine. Today, I scolded Papa. He didn't tell us about his promotion. We will celebrate. Papa promised me a new dress... Mom has already had it ready. So pretty! Shall we go up? What is it? I am scared. Hold my hand, then you won't. Shall we go? Now what? Do you trust me? Then close your eyes. Come on, now. You trust me so much. And you don't even know my name! I know Really, what is it? Raj. In my childhood, Mariamma used to speak about this prince. He would come in a plane and take me somewhere. In the world of magic. In the world of music. Where there will be no darkness. Only happiness and joy. Did you say something? No. Nothing at all. Do you know why did I bring you here? Don't you know why I brought you here? Nobody can see us here, no one can hear us. No one can hear, no one can see. Come closer. Come close to me, Annie. And say. Say what? I've brought you here so that... so that you can say, "I love you". You were scared, right? Please say it. Say it. Oh, come on. Say it. Say that you love me. Okay, Say, "I"... I... "Love"... Okay say, "I hate you". I hate you. Again. I hate you. Again. I hate you. Again. I hate you. Again. I love you. Again. I Love you. All right. I hate you too. Freedom. Flight. Eventually Papa bought one second hand car. The whole world became a steering wheel for him. Which he could control as he liked. Papa was as excited as a child. Your dream has come true. To own a car. Today my dream will come true. Annie will sing. Yes, she will sing. Papa, he wants me to sing. I don't know, I haven't decided yet. Hey, listen! Let me explain. Raj heard Annie's voice. He liked it very much. Raj wants to record Annie's voice. I will explain you everything later. Let's go. I told you not to buy this junk. Now I have to push it to start. Didn't you tell them about Raj? I did not get a chance. Chance... you ain't going to get one without going for it. Raj is an outsider. He doesn't even know I live in a different world. I don't know whether my parents will approve of him. It's not about Raj... They won't let any boy come in your life. They have to live their life on their own without you. You have to explain it to them. I cannot do that. What? Are you going to look after them your entire life? Can you live without Raj? My normal life was slipping away... And Raj was attracting me in his own world. I lived in anticipated fear, whether these two different worlds could become one! Annie, welcome to the world of music. I always wanted to bring you here. To this recording studio. This is not only a recording studio... This is our church. This is our world, our earth, our sky. Can you feel the silence? This silence is full of music. The history of music. I get overwhelmed whenever I come here. Since childhood I always wanted just one thing. Music. Only music. Listen carefully. You feel as if you hear old songs here. The voices of great artistes. What do you hear? I hear Mariamma's voice. I hear her songs. The buoyant laughter of Sam. That childhood rain. Those dreams. Your dreams will come true. We will work hard towards them. And then one day... You will be standing in front of the microphone. And... Drums over here. Saxophones over there. Flutes, violins, trumpets, guitars. Annie, you will be surrounded by music. And everything will be silent. And your voice accompanied by a perfect rhythm, will reach Mariamma. And the whole world will sing with you. Mama! Papa? Can't you hear? Look over there. Mom needs help. I am sorry, Papa. I shouldn't have shouted at you. For a moment I forgot that you couldn't hear. I am sorry. Nothing will happen. I am with you. I will never leave you alone now. Never. After mom's heart attack, I realised... I had to be there for my parents. Every time, every moment. I decided to break up with Raj. But there remained many unsung songs, Many things which we wanted to share, but couldn't! Annie? Annie. Don't take that bus, I am coming. After all, what is the matter? Annie, I love you... and you love me too. Then what's wrong with you? I waited for you at the rehearsal hall but you didn't turn up. You saw me on the road and just ignored me. Why all this? Why don't you speak? You have to answer. I can't live without you. Neither can you without me. Then what is it that is creating the distance between us? Why don't you say something, Annie? Did the cat get your tongue? Are you a mute? Yes, I am indeed dumb. It's just between both of us. Annie! Annie? Where are you taking me? Annie, what are you doing? They will wake up. They won't. Shout! Cry! No one will hear you. My parents are mute. Had I not reached in time... anything could have happened to mom. I can't sing, Raj. I cannot sing! Sorry, Annie. Annie, I am not taking you away from them. Actually I want to give them their son back. And you will sing for them, not for me. Because you are their voice. They cannot hear you. But would at least be able to feel it. Even if you were like them... I would have loved you. Yes. Do you know why? Because I love you. I love you. Eh what! Just now you were asking me to shout. We waited till Mama was better. Raj always used to dispel any fears that I had. I now wanted to sing, without any fear. I wished to experience life with Raj without any burden on my heart. Happy birthday, Papa. Sorry, I got late at the rehearsal. Your favourite flower. This isn't your favourite flower? Yes, your favourite is... It's Mama's. My favourite? Not you? Music? No, Papa, you both are dear to me, not the music. Today I was late because it was the last day of rehearsal. I rehearsed with a full orchestra. There is a recording tomorrow. I'm very nervous. You will have to accompany me. What is so funny? People? They will laugh at you. Why? Because you cannot hear, And are going for your daughter's programme. Over there nobody knows you. Papa, I don't feel at all ashamed of you. No, nothing doing. You will have to come with me. Tomorrow is a very big day for me. I will not sing if you won't come. No! You hate music, right? So, you won't come. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. "This heart's listening to.." "..what your heart's saying." "This heart's listening to.." "..what your heart's saying." "Oh, my loved one." "I'm here, wherever you are." "This heart's listening to.." "..what your heart's saying." "Your words echo in my song." "How will anyone know this?" "Your words echo in my song." "How will anyone know this?" "In the melody, in the tune." "Just you, nothing else." "This heart's listening to.." "..what your heart's saying." "This heart's listening to.." "..what your heart's saying." "Oh, my loved one." "I'm here, wherever you are." "This heart's listening to.." "..what your heart's saying." "Without love." "You and I mean nothing." "Without love." "You and I mean nothing." "This earth is us and so is this sky." "Where do we have to go now?" "Where have to go?" "Where do we have to go?" "Where have to go?" You always say that my shop is crowded. This is just one, but I've enough space for ten christmas trees. Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way. Willy? Where's the piano? I sold it. I sold it, my child. Somebody offered a good price I couldn't refuse. For the first time in my life I made so much profit. It looks so beautiful in the piano's place. We will decorate it. This is the happiest christmas of my life. Merry Christmas, Willy. Mariamma was right. Whatever parts away, comes back sooner or later. My piano also came back. Thank you, Papa. Uncle Willy, You lied to me. You fooled me. I didn't lie. Look Joseph! Hold her. Hold her please. Just let me get my hands... Merry Christmas. Just a minute. This is the biggest Christmas of my life. Thank you. "I'm on top of the world today." "And the sky's beneath me." "I'm ahead today, while the world is behind." "I'm on top of the world today." "And the sky's beneath me." "I'm ahead today, while the world is behind." "Tell me, oh, Lord." "What do I do now?" "Should I walk ahead, or tread backwards?" "I'm on top of the world today." "And the sky's beneath me." "I'm ahead today, while the world is behind." "Tell me, oh, Lord." "What do I do now?" "Should I walk ahead, or tread backwards?" "I'm on top of the world today." "And the sky's beneath me."

"Should I walk on my head, or on my feet?" Papa, he came to say that the people liked our song very much. He could wait till tomorrow. But he wanted to share with us this happiness today. You hate him. But I love him very much. Too much. Raj, you don't understand. Papa is very angry. He won't listen to anything. Last night he was mad at me. He doesn't want me to have anything to do with you again. He says you can't come to our house. And neither can I sing hereafter. Annie, your hands are so pretty. Your hands are very ugly. Very funny! You shouldn't have come home at that hour. That's why Papa is annoyed. He is right. Hey, don't you go changing yourself. Yesterday you were singing "I'm on top of the world today, and the sky's beneath." Okay, tomorrow I'll talk to your dad about our marriage. I don't foresee marriage anywhere in the near future. Near future? I see marriage right now. I will show you. Raj is standing here wearing a black suit, looking handsome. Come, fatty. Annie is here, standing near him in a white dress, looking just okay. The priest says, Raj, do you accept Annie to be your wife? I do. Annie, do you accept Raj as your husband? Try to understand. Do you? It's not that simple... Do you? Do you? I do. And now you may kiss the bride for...one hour. It's not that easy as you make it sound. Annie, I say stop otherwise... Otherwise what? Or else, I will follow you. Annie? I... do love... your daughter. It's good. It'll work. Looks like Uncle is sleeping. Hello, sir. I am Raj. I came to speak to you about Annie. Your daughter Annie. About Annie. You know, l... Do you understand what I am saying? Looks like he doesn't. Sir, Annie and l... Okay, let me put it down for you. What do you read; English or Hindi? Here. Mr. Joseph! Uncle! Please listen to me. Sir, slowly. I have an ailing knee. Sir, please listen to me. Sir, only two minutes. Oh, I see. You prefer to talk while walking? Okay. Let's just sit down. You know, Sir, l... I like Annie very much. Sir, I love her too much. Sir, I wish to marry Annie. I will keep her happy. I know you wouldn't want her to leave Goa. But I too like it here. Sir, I love Goa. We will get along very well. Sir! Please, sir. Okay then! Go ahead. Keep your daughter in your own world. Like father, like daughter! Both giving me a tough time! Go. Sorry, Sir! Sir, I love your daughter, sir. Sir, please listen to me. I love her a lot. I cannot live without Annie. Please help me, Sir. Sir, this is my first marriage. Sir, please listen to me. Sir, please. Sir, please. Okay, sir. Kill me. I cannot live without your daughter. You might as well kill me. Come on, break my head. Papa, please talk to Raj once. He wants to see you. So what if he is from Hindu caste? Why can't we marry? You and mom also loved each other. I am asking for your permission... But you eloped with Mom. Papa! Mama. They are here. Now it all depends on you. Don't be nervous, okay? Smile please. Hello Annie. My parents. I've heard your song. You are as beautiful as your voice. I won't flatter you. Hello. Hello. Meet my parents. Hello. Glad to meet you. Raj always talks about you folks. That's why we decided to... decided to see you. Really, it's a very lovely place. As beautiful as you are. Shall we go in? Please come in. Your wife? Yeah she is very beautiful indeed. He meant that Mama cooks very well. He meant that his wife cooks very well. Yes, very tasty food. Very nice. Excuse me, may I have some water? Water, water. Thank you. Excuse me Sure. What's wrong with you? Didn't you promise not to be angry! I know that outsiders never visit us. It's hard for you. But it's hard for them also. So is it for me. Why are you losing heart? It is a good opportunity to open up to people. Mom, we all are a family now. Nobody is mocking you. Just a minute. You have to trust them. You have to try and reach out to them. You never talk to others. You are confined to your own world. Why, mom? Why? Don't hide yourself from others. Share your feelings with them. Say something. Very strange people! They are making so much noise. Mother, what seems noise to you... is in fact a silence for them. Check out my dive jump here. Oh, my elbow, my elbow! Come, come. One minute. Here. Cover yourself. C'mon. Was I exposed? Yeah, you know that thing...! That? Hiccup. Hiccup! I think somebody's missing you badly. Must be my parents. No! No, Please! No, I have to go. No, look, please don't go. I mean, you've just come. I got to go. Tomorrow I am leaving. You will have to spend whole day with me. Without your hiccups and without your Mama and Papa, okay? Okay. Annie, my shirt! I will keep it with me. I won't leave tomorrow if you don't come. You have to come. Joseph! Be careful! Mom, please. Why do you employ such handicapped people? Joseph has been working here since last 15 years. He is a good craftsman. That's okay but any accident can happen. Like it happened today. You cannot alert him because he can't hear. Doctor, would his hand be alright? Yes, but it will take time to heal. Do you have any other problem? Any other problem? Papa, any other complication? No, he is all right. But his hand must be taken care of. Or, he'll be further handicapped. No, nothing will happen. I will come home for the dressing. Call me if there is any emergency. Papa thanks you. Thank you. Annie, I have to speak to you. Come. Look Annie, we will pay for this treatment. But we can't employ him further. What did you say? He will have pension though. We have our own problems... Papa's hand got burnt... and you're saying you want to sack him! He's worked at your place for 15 years. This thing occurred at the job. He is in such an agony and you want to talk of pension! What do you think you are, huh? Papa says that he will return to work soon. Raj. Raj. Listen to me. Mother was very upset. I couldn't leave her alone. Suddenly Papa... Mother! Papa! And what about me? Am I not a part of your life? You knew I wouldn't leave without seeing you. And yet you didn't come! You were right. We live in two different worlds. We can never be together. Take care of your parents. I am going. You are leaving? Now that I need you most and you're leaving me alone? Papa's hand got burnt. His hand got burnt today. And you know what these hands mean to him! They are his voice. But you will never understand! "Lovers meet in an embrace." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "Wonder what the heart says." "That makes my body sway." "And the heartbeats speak." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "Wonder what the heart says." "That makes my body sway." "And the heartbeats speak." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "These soft lips open and shut.." "These soft lips open and shut.." "They ask me to allow impatience to soar." "Currents pass through every fibre of the body." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "Wonder what the heart says." "That makes my body sway." "And the heartbeats speak." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "The sky too is fond of this lovely mystery." "The sky too is fond of this lovely mystery." "It's fond of the sound of our sighs." "Tears of bliss roll down the cheeks." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "Lovers meet in an embrace." "Wonder what the heart says." "'That makes my body sway." "And the heartbeats speak." "In an embrace." I know what you're thinking. You're wondering if I will ever return. Right? You're just thinking that. Look at me, Annie. Hello! Not now. Later when I come back. You're really pretty when you smile. You look very... very ugly. I love you. I had my fears when I saw Raj leaving. What if he didn't return! Now you're always with me. Not only in my dreams, but in my body too. Raj, my mind is full of aspirations and fear. I have started loving myself. Because he is in my body now. I wish you were here! How will I explain to Mom and Dad? I have made a mistake. Abortion? For the fear of what people might say! Wise thing? Is abortion a wise thing to do? I won't go against the church. I will not go against God. You don't have faith in God. But you have faith in life. You want to kill my love? We will soon marry, don't you go getting upset. Raj will surely come back. He will accept me. I don't care about people. You just accept me as I am. I will stay here. In this house with my baby. You are right. I wish I had died instead of Sam. Papa! What are you doing? Don't fight because of me. Listen to me! I am not irresponsible. For twenty years I forgot my existence and lived for you. And you call me irresponsible! I am not. For you I was not your child, I was only a voice. Two soaps for five rupees. I didn't know the meaning of this. But I kept on saying it on your insistence. And I'm irresponsible? People used to taunt you and only I could hear. I even couldn't cry because you were there. And I am irresponsible! When you took me to buy a coffin for Mariamma. At that time I didn't know what death was. And you blamed me for Sam's death. And I am irresponsible! I am irresponsible. I didn't get to enjoy my childhood. And now that I want to attain motherhood, you want to take away that too from me. Whole life I supported you, looked after you. Now it's your turn. Until you bear this responsibility... I will not return home. Did you hear? Did you hear me? Two for five rupees, sir. Please buy it. Give us one more chance. Speak with smile. Who taught me this? I am sorry. It was a mistake on my part. No, mama. It's not your mistake. I shouldn't have said all that. Sorry, Mama. I am sorry. Papa has agreed? Being a mother yourself you're suggesting abortion? So what if my child were like you? So what if he's born deaf? My child will be a part of me. I would never curse my child. No, mother! I know your life has been that of hardships. Even then you lived your life so courageously. I was never sorry that you were my parents. I am proud of you. If my child were like you, I'd be proud of it too. After all it'd be my own child, my own flesh and blood. Goa! Yeah. Okay everybody! Bye! See you. Have a nice time. A frilly frock for Annie! Yeah. Annie! Driver, please stop the bus. Annie, I love you. Raj! Raj! Listen, she needs to get on the bus. Hey, watch out there. Sorry. Thank you. Stop! Stop the bus. Thank you, driver. Annie! Annie! Stop the bus. Stop the bus please. What are you doing? You are stepping on my feet. Raj. Stop the bus. Annie, I miss you. Excuse me, please stop the bus. Stop the bus! What is it? Nothing. I love you. You look lovely when you smile. You look very... ugly. Beautiful. Papa, it was a mistake on our part. Please forgive us. We never wanted to go away from you. We always wanted to come close to you. I know one day he will forgive me. "Let's get lost in each other." "And be unable to find ourselves." You may kiss the bride. "Two bodies." "Two bodies." "Met in such a way." - "Met in such a way." "That they were unaware." "So, come on. Let's burn our hearts in love." "And may it never be extinguished." "Let's burn our hearts in love." "And may it never be extinguished." "Let's burn our hearts in love." "My darling, I'm crazy about you." "I love you." It all seems just like yesterday. Our wedding. Papa and Mom were not there. The happiest moment of my life, was so incomplete without them. Hello. Yeah, Raj also says that he looks like Papa. Mom, where is Papa? Annie taught me. Sam. Your son Sam. In the name of the Father the Son and the holy ghost. I hereby baptise you. God bless you my son. Dear little Sam's father and mother. This light is.. Once again we had faith in God. And all the joys of life came back. Sam has come back in our lives. Our best wishes are with him. Annie grew up in our tiny village. Today she has become famous. Singing Star. We are happy for Raj and Annie's success. But we are sad to see them leaving, on such a occasion I want... Actually all of us wish... Joseph to come on stage and share his feelings with us. Come Joseph. Come on, Joseph. Don't be shy. Come on. Everybody wants to hear you. Go. Come on. Today... I am very happy. I don't believe that... you all wish to hear me. There are so many more things that I want to say, but I feel at a loss to express myself. Since childhood people have been calling me handicapped. They'd come at our place... look at me and call me deaf and dumb. They pitied me. Some people even made fun of me, laugh at me. But today I have no complaints to God. I am happy. I am deaf and dumb that's why I got Flavy. I am proud of my Flavy. Whether I was wrong or right... Flavy always stood by me. She's like the rays of the sun in my life. At times, she's like the cool shade. And at times, like the harsh heat. But keep shining like this always. I'm always with you. Thank you. Flavy provided me the most beautiful dream of my life. Our daughter Annie. We were fortunate to have Annie in our life. But I wouldn't know if the same would be true for her. She had to suffer a lot for our sake. She became our voice. She had to struggle hard. I used to take her with me to sell soap. Two for five rupees, two for five rupees. I would scold her. I would tell her to smile to speak louder. And I kicked her out of the house... when she was pregnant. But never did she complain. Always kept silent. Forgive me. Thank you. And then God sent Raj for Annie. He came in her life like Prince Charming. Raj gave her so much happiness, which we weren't able to. I always hated Raj. I don't know why. Okay. I won't be able to continue. Do you think trees can speak and hear? Sure they can. The same way I and Flavy communicate. I have talked to trees. I ask, "How are you? Are your parents fine?" Even today I can hear Mariamma's voice. Her songs. Her voice is always with us. She can't go far away. The same way Annie will always be with us. We will feel her in the rays of sun. She would become a bird and come to see me. Annie lives in my heart. She can never go away. Papa! Doctors say Annie is in poor condition. They have almost given up on her. Do something, Papa! I can't live without her. And I know neither can you. Papa, call her back. She is slowly drifting away. Say something. Talk to her. She will come back to hear your voice. Say something. Talk, Father. Papa, please. Papa. Say something. Speak out. She always wanted to hear her name called out from your lips. Throughout her life she has been your voice. Speak today. You will have to bring her back. You will have to! You'll have to. I cannot live without her. - Raj. - For once.- Control yourself, Raj. Call her "Annie" once and she will come back. Papa, bring her back! Come on. Come, sit here. Annie? Papa! Annie, you look beautiful when you smile. You look very ugly. Timings by Bluerain_20
