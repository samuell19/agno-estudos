Hi. I'm Gianna Rossi. I'm here for an interview with Lei Yeung. Tell me about yourself. Well, I graduated magna cum laude from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. I just read that on your resume. Tell me something about you I don't already know. Why the restaurant industry? My family has run a restaurant in Little Italy for three generations now. So why not work there? - We don't have your magic. - We? Yeah. I have three brothers. They can't all take over for Rossi's when our dad retires. The oldest will, and the other two, well, they want their own Rossi's. And your contribution is a degree in restaurant management and a lot of heart. I want to to help them realize their dreams. I want to help other people achieve theirs, too. Thank you, Gianna. I appreciate you coming in today. Ms. Yeung, I really want this job. I work hard. I'm proactive and forward-thinking. I'll make you glad you hired me. I believe you. I just don't think that I would be the right boss for you. - I don't understand. - You don't have to. Trust me. There are a hundred restaurateurs in New York who can give you what you're looking for. Ms. Yeung, we have a lot in common. Ian Pembry underestimated you, isn't that right? Well, I had a man in my life who underestimated me. You proved everybody wrong. I just want to do the same. I hope you do. Thank you for your time. I'm telling you, she's an idiot. You're lucky you didn't get that job today. - Angelo's right. - I'm always right, Nico. Only when you're repeating what I said. It's good to see you smile. - You know, everything happens... - For a reason. I know, Mom. - It still sucks. - I know. Eat your fettuccine before it gets cold. Red or white? How about champagne? Lots of rave reviews about this place online. Best Italian food ever. A lot of them say a great place got even greater over the past couple of years. Am I right in assuming that's due to your influence? You're right. Ian underestimated me, but he did not take advantage of me. Blaming him would give him too much credit. I left the door open and he walked through it. He taught me a lot. And I've come to realize that he got just as much out of that as I did. I've been getting too used to the way I've always done things. I need fresh eyes. I want to feed off of someone else's hunger. - You want a protege. - Exactly. I'm in, if you want me. I'll need you on weekends, and I might call in the middle of the night. - I work all the time. - I won't complain. I will. I still need to see her every once in a while. My brother Angelo. - Hi. - Hi. That's my brother Nico and my mom. Hi. Nice to meet you. Welcome to Rossi's. Mrs. Rossi. - And my brother Vin and my dad. - Hey. - How's the panna cotta? - You'll never have better. I'm counting on it. Welcome to Savor, Gianna. God, what a rush. It never gets old. Ladies. Stacy, Chad. You both look fabulous. I hope your rooms are comfortable. They're all right. Don't listen to her. They're great. I slept like a rock. I didn't. Ian kept calling. He knows something's up. Of course he does. He's a smart man... which is why I'm surprised he didn't do more to keep you both happy. Ian did a lot for us. I feel disloyal. You shouldn't. You haven't signed anything yet. But if you feel that your identity as the Williams twins has more potential than Stacy Williams, then you should absolutely go with your gut. Got you this far, after all. Don't be an ass, Stace. You, me, dueling kitchens. This casino deal is a perfect opportunity for us. Yes, but it may not be the only opportunity. Ian says we have to at least give him a chance to deliver. You told him. It wasn't your decision to make. This is my career, too. The Mondego deal is exclusive to Savor, of course. What is Ian offering you? Ian, what an interesting surprise. Lei, a pleasure, as always. I would like to introduce my associate, Jackson Rutledge. Gia... So... what's on the table? What are the chances that Jackson Rutledge is related to Senator Rutledge, or any of the other Rutledges for that matter? A hundred percent. Jackson and the senator are brothers. What the hell is Ian doing with a Rutledge? I don't know. Jackson is the only one of the Rutledge males not serving in political office somewhere in the country. He manages Rutledge Capital, a venture capital firm. Is he married? Any children? Neither. He plays the field. A lot. Prefers pedigreed blondes in public, but won't turn down a roll in the hay with something flashier in a pinch. You got that from a five minute search? No. I got that from five weeks in his bed. Ah. So he's the one. Well, this just got interesting. It wasn't serious. More like an extended one-night stand. I don't even think he even recognized me back there. You're not a woman that a man forgets, Gianna. Drive. I think we can work around this Rutledge situation, but are you up for it? If this is gonna get personal, then we need to talk about that now. - I'm not indifferent to him. - I can see that. Let's keep you on this for now. You'll throw Rutledge off balance, and we'll need that. And you're my "in" with Chad Williams. - He likes doing business with you. - Thank you. Any idea why Rutledge would have a sudden interest in the restaurant industry? If I had to make a guess, I'd say one of the Rutledges owed Pembry a favor. We'll need to figure out what chip he's cashing in. Yeah. He's here? Have him sent up. I'll be around in a minute to show him to the conference room. Rutledge is about to arrive at reception. Interesting. Is Ian with him? LaConnie didn't say so. You can stay for the meeting with Rutledge or not, your choice. Maybe I should use this time to reach out to Chad, see where he's at with this. I know we wanted to take the Williams twins together, but even if we get just one, it'll hurt Pembry. Good plan. Forgive me for asking, Gianna, but did you love Jackson? I thought we loved each other. A Long Island and a whiskey on the rocks. You've been paying attention. With as much staring as you you've been doing, you should be buying me a drink. How about dinner instead? You hungry? I could eat. Let's go someplace where we can actually hear each other. You wanna talk? We'll start there, see what happens. Hello, Mr. Rutledge. Ms. Yeung will be with you in just a moment. I'll show you to the conference room. How long are you going to pretend you don't know me, Gia? Please step back. You changed so much. Enough that you didn't recognize me earlier. Jesus. You think I didn't know it was you? You could never hide from me, Gia. I'd recognize you blindfolded. What are you doing here, Jax? I'm gonna offer Lei Yeung whatever it takes to make her go play in someone else's sandbox. It won't work. This is personal. Business should never be personal. Nothing's personal, right? Things were between us once. No, they weren't. There should be no hard feelings then. Good. There's no reason not to pick up where we left off. My meeting with Yeung shouldn't take long. When I'm done, we can head to a hotel and get reacquainted. Fuck you. There you are. You almost had me fooled into thinking the Gia I knew was gone. Don't toy with me, Jax. It's beneath you. I want you beneath me. Mr. Rutledge. I'm going to assume this is a pleasant surprise. It can be. I'll leave you two to it then. Hey, it's Gianna. I was hoping you'd call. Do you have dinner plans? I can break them. Smart, bringing me here. Showing me you got the business in your blood, too. It's not just a job. Introducing me to your folks? Plan on keeping me around a while? I'd like to. I think we could work really well together. Me, too. Stacy knows that what you're offering is exactly what we're looking for. - But... - But what? She's sleeping with Ian, and it's screwing everything up. Chad, the Mondego resort chain is five-star all the way. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. Don't let Stacy take it away from you. You know, you could make it on your own, too. Give it to me straight, Gianna. I know you'd say damn near anything to close this deal. I wouldn't screw you over, Chad. In fact, it doesn't get Lei or me any good if you're not successful. Plus, now I'll know how to track you down through your folks. Thirty years in the same location. My brother Nico just opened Rossi's Two in Jersey. Yeah? Fuck. - You invited Stacy, too? - No. - We could sneak out the back. - Is he meeting you? No. They don't have to sit with us. All right. I'll make sure he's seated somewhere else. Good. He's got your back. That's the Rossi way. Stacey and I used to be like that... before Ian showed up. Stacey can take Ian's deal if she wants to. I'm gonna stick with you and the Mondego. Okay. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Gianna. I have to applaud you for your choice in men. Can I pick 'em or what? How'd it go? As expected. You guessed right, by the way. Jackson said he's stepped in as a favor for someone. I haven't had a chance to check for more details yet. I've been with Chad since I left. - How is Chad? - He's on board but I think we'd be wise to get a contract drawn up ASAP. Jax isn't going home gracefully. He crashed dinner hour at Rossi's, bringing Stacy along for the show. - I'm sorry, but I like him. - Happens. Ian called, by the way. He asked if I'd see him tonight. Maybe that's why Jax is with Stacy. - Baby-sitting duty. - Could be. I said no, in any case. I feel like our men are circling the wagons, which means we need to keep doing what we're doing. I have not had this much fun in years. I gotta go, Lei. I'll call you later. Are you thinking about fucking Chad Williams because you want to, or because you want him to sign on the dotted line? - Gia? - Don't call me that. And what would you prefer? Let's see. I'd prefer not see or hear from you again. - Why not? - I'd think that'd be obvious. Not to me. We know each other. We get along well. Very, very well. Please. I'm not fucking you again. Why not? Tell me why you're so angry at me. You fell off the face of the earth for two years. It had to end, and it did. Quietly. No messy scenes. No ugly memories. Neat and tidy. So why rehash and screw it up, right? - Can we be friends? - No. Can we do business together? Please. You made this personal from the get-go. God, you are sexy as hell when you're angry at me. You know, I shoulda pissed you off more often. - Back off, Jax. - I did, and it didn't take. Actually, it did. Go back to your world and forget about me again. My world. Right. Have lunch with me tomorrow. We need to talk. - I've got nothing to say to you. - Then listen. No, you listen. You've got no right invading my life like this. None of this is your business anyway, so quit butting in. Damn it, Gia, I didn't know that you were in love with me. If that's true, then you didn't know me at all. - Gianna, you in there? - Yeah. Hang on. Don't fuck him. - You got a death wish, Rutledge? - Leave it alone, Vin. Sexy. Bye. Gia... I found something... an article tying Pembry with the Rutledges. A tiny mention of Pembry supporting and contributing to Rutledge campaigns. I lived with Ian for five years. He never once voted. He's too much of a tight-ass to spend the kind of money it takes to get the Rutledges' personal attention. Would Jackson tell you what sparked his interest in Ian if you asked him? - Maybe. - Aren't you curious? Not enough to go out of my way to talk to Jackson. I guess the best solution is to just get this wrapped up. I'm talking with Mondego today about moving forward with just Chad. I think I have an appealing alternative to Stacy. Isabelle specializes in regional Italian, while Inez has a flair for regional French. Dueling kitchens, international. Awesome. You can get that here. Good morning, Gianna Rossi speaking. Miss Rossi, Ian Pembry. Mr. Pembry, I was just thinking about you. Would you be available for lunch sometime? Well, I'm flattered you'd choose me over Jackson, but I was hoping for dinner instead. I have an event this evening, and I need a date. What about Stacy? She's wonderful, of course, but I'd prefer to take you. You'll want to come along too, Lei, and look out for your girl, which is fine. The more the merrier. It's a formal event. I'll arrange transportation. You're assuming I don't have plans on a Friday night. Don't be offended, Miss Rossi. It's a compliment to your dedication. Lei wouldn't have hired you if you didn't put the job first. I'll see you tonight. Well, what do you think? I think we need to go shopping. Get you something stunning to wear. Wow! Who are you and what have you done with my sister? Shut up. She looks like a movie star, like a real, you know, goddesses, like Raquel Welch or Sophia Loren. - Who? - What's the matter with you? Oh, yeah, the one with the ample bosom. Oh, my God. - Tell her she looks good. - You look great. - You look great. - Knockout. Thank you. You're sexy. You play it down at work, which I understand and appreciate, but don't waste it. It's a terrible myth that a successful woman can't be sexy without losing her credibility. Don't buy into it. Ladies. You're toying with one of my people. You never used to be cruel. I used to have a heart, and then someone broke it. Shall we? - What event is this? - It's a private fund-raiser. - For a Rutledge? - Of course. I took the liberty of pairing you up with Chad, Lei. I just met the governor of Louisiana. He knew who I was. How do politics and the food-service industry mix? Strange bedfellows, I'll admit, but everyone eats. Not everyone votes. You were always much more conscientious than I in that regard, Lei. What about you, Gianna? Isn't politics one of those subjects it's wiser not to discuss? Shall we dance? So, tell me how you know Jackson. I don't know him. Yesterday was not the first time that you'd met. Since I'm sure you knew that before you brought him into the mix, I'm interested in how you two know each other. I know his father, Parker Rutledge. He introduced us. Speak of the devil. What was the reason you brought us here, Ian? How ambitious are you, Gia? I'm loyal to Lei. Well, I was, too, but unfortunately, you'll find that she's not quite as loyal in return. Parker, Gianna Rossi. Gianna, Parker Rutledge and his lovely wife, Regina. - Hello. - Miss Rossi, a pleasure. - Regina, dance with me. - Sure. Gianna. That's an unusual name. It's a family name. I bet you were surprised to see Jackson again. I'm more surprised that Ian felt the need to involve him in our business. Oh, I involved Jackson. Ian did me the wonderful favor of introducing me to Regina, and I've looked out for him ever since. I wasn't aware of you, though. I assume Ian was. Excuse me. I'm cutting in. - I didn't think you'd show. - You didn't give me a choice. You look amazing. I'm glad you approve. Breathe, Gia, I've got you. I don't want to be here. That makes two of us. Your father knew who I was. Clearly I wasn't the dirty little secret I thought I was. Not dirty. Except when you wanted me to be. A little rough, a lot hard. Jesus. You used to turn me inside out. You've been drinking. Driven to it. I didn't know it'd be so damn hard to see you again. Isn't that Ted? And Allison. She's as happy to see me now as she was when you introduced me to her in Vegas. She's more miserable now. Rutledge life will do that to you. - I want champagne. - Is that right. Yep. Come with me. Wow. Whose house is this? It's a Rutledge estate. Of course it is. Pretend we crashed this party. Seems like we've been pretending all along. I don't feel like I know you at all. So get to know me. I'm going to kiss you. - No, you're not. - Try to stop me. - Jackson. - Shut up, Gia. Gia. Christ, I want you. You had me. I made the right decision walking away. That doesn't mean I don't regret it. - You'll hurt me. - I'll worship you. You remember how it was. Hours. My hands and mouth on you. My cock inside you. - I need more than sex, Jax. - I'll give you everything I got. - Yeah. For how long? - Christ, Gia, just take what I can give you. - No. It's not enough, Jax. - It has to be. Christ. Don't ask me to turn you into one of them. What are you talking about, Jax? Mind if we join you? Oh, my God. You got Chad to sign. It's a tentative agreement, based on getting Isabelle and Inez on board, and you overseeing the first restaurant, but it's got him on the hook. Wow. I can't believe you had this on you. Did you know he was gonna be there? I suspected, knowing Ian. Oh, by the way, Parker Rutledge explained the connection. Ian introduced Parker to the latest Mrs. Rutledge. Did he? Let's enjoy the weekend. Turn your phone off, forget about work. We'll hit it fresh on Monday. Gia, Christ, I want you. You remember how it was. Don't disappear. See me again. - This better be good. - Nico, hi. Sorry. I'll call back tomorrow. Gianna, what's up? Nothing. I'll call back tomorrow. Bye. Don't hang up on me. Listen, one sec. One sec. It's about Jackson? I thought maybe I could come visit. Now? You're busy. By the time you get here, I won't be. All right. Hey. It's good to see you. No, it's not. I'm sorry I crashed tonight. It's all right. I got mine, she got here, so, you know. - Nico. Do you mind? Gross. - Want some beers or something? Come on, Nico. Is it serious? No, it's nothing serious. I ain't got time for that. Just a little something on the side. Rossi's Two is keeping me too busy. So Jax is back, huh? Vincent owes me a hundred bucks. Are you kidding me? You bet on Jax? Bet on you. He was gonzo over you, which means he was either going to put a ring on your finger or run scared. Then I figured he'd run and come back once the fear wore off. You still love him? Yeah. Damn it. And him, where's he coming from? Should I knock a little sense into him? God, I missed you. Time to get drunk. Where's my drink order? Pick it up, Rossi. What, are you slower in Jersey? You're lagging, I'm waiting. Let's go. Hear this? She's rushing greatness. What are you doing here? Have dinner with me. You followed me to Jersey just to ask me out? Order up. Jackson, I was just talking to Gianna how I'm gonna kick your ass. It's good to see you, too, man. I missed you. Don't fuck with me, Jax. It's not cool. You missed me, too. Yeah, I did. Back up. Hey. You training him? Tried to. Failed miserably. I've been asking her to try again. Give it a shot, girl. Trying is half the fun. Yeah, I've been trying to tell her that. I've been patronizing this establishment for a long time. You okay? Yeah. I'm gonna step out for a bit. Just like that, huh? Give him hell. You staying somewhere? Got a hotel room close, yes. Let me grab my purse. There's no rush. In three days you popped up where I'm at four different times. Now you're gonna cock block yourself? You got a point. I'll go get the car. Bye, Gia. Hurry up, Jax. I can't even feel my legs. - Hey. - Hey. I'm sorry we didn't take it to the bedroom. It's okay. I'm not complaining. I'll get you there as soon as I can walk. Getting old, Rutledge? Out of practice. Yeah. Right. Escorting a woman somewhere and fucking her are two different things. Hey. Don't check out on me now. I'm here. I'm in this. Yeah. For how long? The weekend? Gia. I don't have the time or the patience to pretend like we're building something here when we're not. Who's pretending? I can't do this. Not with you. I fell for you the last time. I can't do it again. You're still in love with me. Give me a chance to make that something you don't regret. You can't just walk away without a goodbye like last time. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you're through when you've had enough. And I want monogamy. Damn straight. I'm not sharing you with anyone. I was talking about you being monogamous. That's a given. What else? I'm hungry. I want you to take me back to Rossi's Two for dinner. You always did get hungry after sex. And I'm not spending the night with you, Jax. I came here to spend the weekend with my brother. Fair enough. So... Regina's your stepmom, huh? Yeah. Yeah, my mom died ten years ago. I'm sorry to hear that, Jax. Not as sorry as I was. Got a bottle of our finest here. I'm fairly certain you can serve yourselves. I think we can manage. Thank you. Your mom looks great. She's happy. Her kids are all right, business is good, and she's about to be a grandmother. How's Angelo dealing with impending fatherhood? Good. It threw off his plans to open another Rossi's, but that's probably for the best. His wife Denise has her own business, so I think it would've been a strain for them to juggle two startups and a new baby. Do you like her? Oh, yeah. She's great. How's Allison and Ted doing? They barely talk to each other. But she knows how to work the press, and she's very active in handling his campaign. He made a good choice with her. Wow. I thought political marriages were a Hollywood stereotype. You've got to be very pragmatic about relationships. Marrying for love never works out well. Mom and Dad were a love match, and they made each other miserable. Now, Regina and Dad... they'll be just fine. She knows how to play the game. Ian introduced them, right? Which he called in as a favor and got you to step in. You can't save him, Jax. Lei's too good. Well, I was never asked to save anyone. I'm just supposed to keep Lei at bay, and I can do that. Mind if I join you two? The more Rossis, the merrier. Hey, can we get another wine glass and a place setting, please? Thank you. You know, I forgot how much I like Jax. You two going to work it out? No. It's temporary. But this time I know the rules. Maybe I don't like him so much. You know he's in love with you. My offer to knock some sense into him still stands. Might be easier to knock sense into me. Can do that, too. You're gonna be fine. You'll get through it. Come on, sis. Let's go. Come on. What the... You found us. I missed waking up next to you. Rutledge. Well, well, well. Kick back, killer. Hi. I'm Denise, Angelo's wife. - A pleasure. - I have heard a lot about you, none of it good. I hope you prove the guys wrong. Oh, she doesn't talk about you at all. Hey, are we playing ball or what? Let's do this. - That's my girl. - Hey, Jax, you're with Gia. I'm sweating vodka. I need a break. Lose the shirt, pretty boy. - Ready? - Yep. Look out, sis. Put it in the hoop. - Punch it in. - Nice job. - Atta girl. - Wake up! - Here we go. - Vince. You guys are fucking pathetic. Down, down. - Look at that form. - Look at that. Put it up, homes. - What are you doing? - She puts it in again. I swear, she got all the athletic style anyway. Hey, Gia. Whoever sent you those might be a keeper. Thanks, LaConnie. Gia get in here. Ian got to Isabelle over the weekend and signed her. What? How did he know about our plans? That's a good question. I haven't told a soul, no one. I believe you. Did you see Jackson Rutledge this weekend? I did, but we didn't talk business, Lei. Rutledge Capital made a significant investment in Pembry Ventures. Isabelle says she spoke to Jackson himself on Sunday, and he confirmed it. She spoke with Jackson yesterday? I went ahead and signed Inez. Good call. We should probably take Chad back on a site tour of the Mondego in Atlanta. Let him get a sense that things are really moving forward. - Do you want to do that? - Yeah. I think I could use a few days away. You okay? I'm fine. I'm having dinner with Jackson tonight, actually. That should be interesting. Oh, you can bet on it. Hello, gorgeous. You fucked me over, Jax. Right after you fucked me literally. - Get in the car, Gia. - You're an asshole. Always have been. Took you a long time to figure it out. Don't lose your confidence now. What, are you angling for a kiss-off screw? I'm not ending things. I want you. That's not news. For future reference, the slap was overkill. You had me down for the count with the kiss. It's just a minor setback you'll have no problem overcoming. You're damn right. This isn't you. No? How long have you had this place? About a year. A year? You want a drink? Definitely. You won't throw it in my face? I'm tempted. I am sorry. Then why did you do it? Why do I do anything? Because I'm a Rutledge. We fuck people over, Gia. That's just who we are. That's a cop-out. That's the truth. If you want to walk out, I won't stop you, but I would like for you to stay. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment. I'm going to match your backstabbing move... and raise you one round of angry sex. Gia. I can play this game. And I can win. God! Jesus. Just like that. Keep going. Damn it. Finish me. It's tough when you're working toward something and the excitement builds and you can almost taste it, then someone takes it away from you, isn't it? Get back here. Suck me or fuck me. I think you need to cool off a bit first. I think you should get your gorgeous ass back to bed first. Gia. Gia. Oh, I think you should get that. I don't think so. Jackson! I know you're here. We need to talk! Give me a minute! You stay here. Don't you want me to say hi? I won't give him the satisfaction. What I do is my business. Gia, don't go. I'll ride down with you, Miss Rossi. Give me five minutes. How about I call you later? It's all right, Jackson. I'll show her out. I meant what I said. You always do. How are you, Gianna? I've been better. How about you? You make it awkward to say it's been a good day so far. A good day for your friend Ian, too. Please don't hold that against Jackson. Just business, right? You're a practical woman. I'd like to get to know you better, Gianna. Would you and Jackson come for dinner with my wife and me? Something quiet at our house in the Hamptons, maybe. - I'd like that. - Good. I'll let Regina know. And don't let Jackson talk you out of it. He wants to keep you all to himself. Does he? Oh, he's very protective of you. What would he have to protect me from? Hey. You still talk to Deanna? Yeah. Why? I need someone to catch me up on the Rutledges. The guy's a douche. He doesn't deserve you. Will you just ask her, please? Fine, but only because I hope she digs up something that convinces you he's bad news. - Thank you. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't think you're getting off with a simple thank-you. I've got a basket of laundry over there that needs washing. - Are you kidding me? - Nope. Better hurry. I'm out of Rossi's T-shirts, and my shift starts in two hours. - Vincent. - Hey. You were supposed to call. So were you. Took you two years to get around to it. Why did you leave? It was time to go. Your dad invited us to dinner, by the way. - We're not going. - I'll go without you. The hell you will. Those pictures you've got framed in your penthouse. How long have you been following me, Jax? You're fucking a Rutledge. Surveillance and invasion of privacy come with the territory. I wasn't fucking you at the time those pictures in your office was taken. You were in my office? What the fuck, Gia? What do you think you're doing? Processing the fact that you're in love with me, Jax. But still, you bailed. Now you're sabotaging my work and your own chances with me. Gia. I'm on to you, Jax. I'm going to figure you out. Your mystery man days are numbered. Hey, Deanna. Thanks meeting me. How have you been? I'm good. You? Chasing a story, as always. So Vincent says you wanted me to look into something? Yeah. Jackson Rutledge. Right. Care to tell me why? We've been seeing each other again. And what did you want to know? I mean, things like ex-girlfriends you can just find with a Google search. No, that's not what I'm interested in. I don't understand why he'll do anything for his family when he doesn't always seem to like them. He certainly spends a lot of time warning me away from them. At first I thought he was hiding me, but now I feel like he's protecting me. If he cares about you, that may well be what he's doing. You gotta figure the Rutledges, they're like tiger sharks, they swim around in the same womb, but they just cannibalize each other until only the strongest comes out alive. Okay, so who's the strongest shark in that family? - Parker Rutledge? - Without a doubt. What do you know about Jax's mom? Leslie Rutledge? Talk about an enigma. Almost never seen in public the last five years of her life, and she avoided the spotlight even before that. Yeah, I could poke around, see what turns up. It might take some time, though, because whenever you turn over a Rutledge stone, security teams just come crawling out. I'd appreciate anything you could find. - Yeah, sure thing. Okay. - Thanks, Deanna. Gia, I like what I see. Thanks for flying me to Atlanta. This is all starting to feel real. Good. I'm glad you're happy. How much say are the other chefs gonna get in this whole process? Well, in their menus, a lot. But you're the celebrity here, so they're riding your coattails for now. I hope that's not gonna be a problem. I suspect it'll be easier than working with your sister. Speaking of which, I don't know how I feel about... whatever's going on between you and Jackson Rutledge. Rutledge helped break apart the deal that I had with Stacy, then he nabbed Isabelle. Now he's financing Pembry. You're the gal that has all my info. You know my entire plan, and... now you're with him. Chad, I would never do that. But he would. That doesn't mean I can't handle him. With that said, I understand your concern. And you have to do what you feel is best. Open the door, Gia. Jax? What are you doing in Atlanta? You weren't answering your cell. News flash, I'm avoiding you. Good luck with that. Turn around and fly home. I'm working, and I don't trust you around my work. Chad just fired me because of you, thank you. You can't run from me, and you can't pull that shit you did yesterday. - We need to talk. - I agree, but I don't have the patience to run around in circles, so, unless you've got real answers for me, I'm not giving you any more of my time. You're going to give me a hell of a lot more than time, Gia. Wow. You really ought to do something about that ego. Baby, I will crawl on my hands and knees if that's what it takes. Open the door. You've got a great family, Gia. I've always known where I stood with them, good or bad. My family is not like yours. Don't fall for my dad's charms. He only gives the time of day to people who are useful. Well, I don't have anything. You have me. Is he the reason you stayed away the past couple of years? I stayed away because it's the best thing for you. I've seen what can happen. I've seen the stress rip people apart. Well, I guess I have more faith in you than you have in yourself. I think you can take him, Jax. I trust that you'd watch out for me. You really think I'd protect you from the big bad wolf? I am the big bad wolf, baby. You want to be with me? You want to be my girlfriend? You want to go to parties with me, events, have dinner with my family? - Yeah. - Fine. Your life is about to change completely. Your privacy is a thing of the past. Every questionable thing that you've ever done is about to become tomorrow's news. Your brothers' lives are up for grabs, too. Same goes for your parents and friends. You go outside, photographers will follow. From what you wear to how you vote, everything is fair game. You can't scare me. Oh, I will. If you want it all, that's what you'll get... The good and the really fucking ugly. Bring it on. I will tell you what to wear, what to say, how to act. It's what I do, Gia. Image is everything in politics and business, although I suspect you've already figured that out, haven't you? You've laid a lot of the groundwork for me. Sometimes, I barely even recognize you. You know, I'd face all that and more for a guy who really loved me, but I won't put up with shit from a jerk. I give it to you straight, and you flip. You could have said something like "Listen, Gia, "sharing my life with you won't be easy, but I love you, and I'll do whatever it takes to make our private life worth the public hell." - I don't know. - Fuck! This isn't a goddamn romance novel! I love you. I love you so much that it's driving me crazy. I want you in my home. I want to wake up to you. To go to sleep holding you. To come home from work... and eat dinner with you. I want what we had in Vegas, but things were different then. I had you all to myself. It won't be like that now. I get it. I can deal with it, okay? I hope so. Because I'm not going to be able to let you go after this, Gia. For better or worse, you're mine. You're making my head spin. I'm just returning the favor, babe. Hey! Oh! She's moving in, and she doesn't even have a ring. It's the twenty-first century. If he wants the milk, he should get the cow. - You're calling me a cow? - No. If he wants you around so bad, he should put a ring on it. Before she even knows what she's getting into? Hey. Jackson, there's something wrong with your view. Too much sky. You can't spy on your neighbors. I've got all the view I need right here. Yikes. Little too much cheese on that pizza. Okay! With the hands, buddy! Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a beer. I'm gonna love watching you get ready for work every morning. You've still got too many clothes on. You've ruined me for other women, Gia. Good. Hey. Everything all right? You up for one of those mind-numbingly boring affairs I warned you about? I'm up for anything that puts you in a tux. When is it? Tonight. You couldn't give me more notice? I'll need to go shopping. I've got a stylist coming with some options within the hour. I love that dress on you. In a couple of hours, we can fly back to New York... or we can grab a room here in the hotel. Or we can join the mile-high club. After all, what's the point of taking a private jet if we don't get naughty in it? And once again I have an erection in public. Thank you very much. Give me a second, babe. Well, you clean up nicely. That's a beautiful dress. Gretchen must be partial to it. She suggested it to me, as well, but it's not my style. You're smart to let Jackson dress you. But then you're obviously smarter than I gave you credit for, or you wouldn't be here. Can you go be a bitch somewhere else, Allison? You're not a woman who likes pretense or bullshit, so I'm not gonna shovel any your way. Besides, have to get along, Our men our brothers, after all. We don't have to do anything. I suggest we do our best to avoid one another. That's not how this works, Gianna. You and I are going to be best friends. As far as public knowledge goes. We'll have lunch and shop together. Ted and I will have dinner with you and Jackson. We'll go to galleries and exhibitions. Ball games, all sorts of things where we'll smile for the camera and look tighter than sisters. I'll let Jackson explain it to you. I'll plan for us to have dinner in the city soon. Enjoy yourself, Gianna. And again, you look stunning. That dress was made for you. Jackson. Dance with me. You're the most beautiful woman here. Flattery will get you everywhere. I'd rather not work with stylists that are also working with Allison. I don't like her, Jax. She's not my favorite person either, but she's family. I would never ask you to sit quietly while someone insults you. I respect you more than that, Jax. It's not about respect, Gia. Whether we like her or not, we've all got to work together. I couldn't be happier. Okay, great, we'll talk tomorrow. That was Chad. What did he say? He just had a meeting with Jackson Rutledge. Oh no. Jackson offered to make a three million dollar investment in Chad, for a thirty percent share. What? Jackson is offering to guarantee that he won't sabotage Chad, to the tune of a few million dollars. He didn't say anything about wanting to work with anyone else. There's no reason to, if the offer is legit. You and Jackson have been busy the last couple of weeks. Look at this shot of the two of you. That's not that movie star, what's his name, behind you, is it? Yeah. It is. It's been a whirlwind. - Did hell just freeze over? - Hmm? What's going on, Gia? That's the second time he's been in here this week. Ted Rutledge? I didn't know anything about this. Yeah? Can Jackson say that? What are you doing here? Picking you up. I'm not coming home. I'm not leaving you here to drink and stew over whatever's got you pissed off. Why did you interfere with Chad? I solve problems, Gia. You know that. So first you create them and then you fix them? While I have no input. No control. Is that what you think? Christ, Gia, you've got me by the balls. I don't appreciate Rutledges coming in here and jerking my family and me around. I've talked to your dad about this. What exactly did you talk to my dad about? Having Rossi's featured as a thriving and expanding small business in various materials. Political materials. What else? Why didn't you tell me? We don't talk about work. I don't want my family being used, Jax. And I don't want my girlfriend making assumptions about my motives. - Well... - And before you begin to argue further... Let me be clear: There is no scenario where I walk out of here without you. I'm sleeping in the guest room tonight. I'm sorry. Thank you for that. I'm sorry, too. But that doesn't fix the problem we're having with the way we communicate. Jax, if you don't start including me, we won't make it far. Fair enough. Just remember, when things get rough, don't forget I need you. So, does he have a brother? You okay? Rutledge problems. Let me know if you need to talk. - Hello? - Gianna? Oh, hey, Deanna. How are you? Excellent, excellent. So I looked into the Rutledges, focusing on Leslie Rutledge as you suggested. And you've got great instincts, I just hit a gold mine on that one. Oh? The family had her committed to a sanatorium for a few months. It was... Oh, thanks. It was after she was released that she disappeared from public view. There was, like, a few rumors back then, nothing concrete, but now I've got a reliable source. Ugh. I can't confirm what kind of mental illness she had, but the real story here is that she was expendable. She had a problem, the family just packed her up, -out of sight. -You don't know that. Uh. Yeah. I do. Anyway. More details will emerge after the story breaks. They always do. What do you mean after the story breaks? Well, it's news and about to be public knowledge. That wasn't the deal, Deanna. What deal? We didn't have one. You can't run this story. It's already done, Gianna. Your name isn't mentioned, so don't worry about that. Listen, I've got to go. I just wanted to give you a head's up, say thanks and take care, all right? - I'm taking this. - No. Deanna? I don't think so, okay? Good day to you. What's going on? We're trying to put out a fire. Sorry we've taken over, but Jackson prefers to handle some issues from his home office. Is there anything I can do? Just take care of my son. We need those records now. And don't think whatever this is won't blow back on you, too. - Hey. - Hey. Baby. I'm sorry, I know we have things to talk about but something's come up and I've got to get a handle on it. What's wrong? We got a tip today about an article going out, I'm trying to get information on the reporter and her piece. Deanna Johnson. You know her? She used to date Vin. Fuck. I need all the information that you have on her right now. Jax, we got to talk. I know, look, and we will. But I can't right now. This is my fault. No, it's not. I should've told you about Ted and... She's written an article about your mother. About how your family had her committed to an institution. You talked to her. Weeks ago. And then earlier this afternoon. I'm so sorry, Jax. I never should have contacted her. I had no idea she was gonna write an article. Sit down and tell me what the fuck you're talking about. I contacted Deanna as a friend. This was before we ever talked about never having privacy again. Do you realize what you've done? How much damage you might have caused? My mother's disease was never supposed to be fodder for the fucking media. Jax, I know this is incredibly personal, and painful, but a lot of families deal with mental illness. She wasn't crazy, Gia. She was a drunk. She couldn't handle the pressure. She was weak. She married the wrong man for what she wanted. You said your parents loved each other. You told me that before. Parker is trying to change the world. She would've preferred that he change a light bulb. What, she didn't like politics? She didn't like the life that goes along with it. Agendas require allies, and allies require compromise. She didn't like some of the compromises that had to be made. Alcohol was liquid courage for her. She used it as a crutch. Jax, when you said someone in your life had been torn up by the stress, you were talking about your mother, weren't you? She was a lot like you. Her family... her expectations of what a relationship with my father would be like. She thought that being politically active and aware was a choice, not a responsibility. Well, if she was kept in the dark like me, I don't blame her for not being on the same page as the rest of you guys. My dad told her everything, and that was his mistake. He wanted her approval, but all he did was alienate her. Sometimes the end justifies the means, but the means can be ugly. You're so angry with her, Jax. Yeah, and I have a right to be. She tried to make me choose between her and my father's vision. No one should be forced in that position, least of all a teenager. I can't get into this with you right now. I've got to do... something. Damage control, if that's even possible. What can I do? You can go and stay with your brothers for the night. And pack a bag with a couple days' worth of clothes. Wow. Did you cut your mom off like this, too? Is that how you deal with the people in your life who love you when they inconvenience you? For all of her faults, she never sabotaged us. That's not fair, Jax. I made a mistake, and I can't begin to explain how sorry I am. But I made it because I love you, not because I wanted to hurt you. This whole relationship has been a mistake. You know what, Jackson? Fuck you. I understand why he did it. I'd be seriously pissed off if some chick I was seeing sicced an investigator after me. We're not seeing each other, Nico, we live together. That's worse. You got to go to a woman who's outside of your relationship for news on the guy you're shacked up with? That's whack shit, Gianna. Can you please stop being so negative for one minute and just help me find a way out of this mess? The solution to being with the wrong guy is to leave. There. Problem solved. I'm thinking Deanna is the problem. I never liked that bitch. Vincent never liked her much either. He only put up with her because she was crazy in bed. Liked the kink and the bondage. TMI, Nico. Seriously? And it's kinda uncool that you guys are sharing that level of detail with each other. Whatever happened to privacy? I never asked to see those photos she was sexting him. Anyway, he should've warned you about her. She'd once told him she got her career started by sleeping with prominent married men, and then using pillow talk and extortion, if necessary to get leads out of them. So, should I head up there this weekend and help you move your stuff out? Um, on, not yet. Let me call you back. Ti amo, fratello. Love you, too. Hey, what's up, Gianna? Hello to you, too, Deanna. I'll make this quick. Kill the Rutledge story or I post X-rated photos of you on every revenge porn site known to man. Bullshit. Is it? You want to take that chance? Okay, those photos are private property. You're throwing privacy in my face? Okay, two totally different things, Gianna. The Rutledges gave up any expectation of privacy when they decided to take a stab at running this country. You're taking it too far. And you're not? There are laws against revenge porn, Gianna. If you post those pictures, it will... it's gonna come back against you and the Rutledges. And then you will be the enemy. There's laws against extortion, too. That didn't stop you. Okay, I don't know what you think you've got on me. I've got enough. Kill the Rutledge story, or I kill your reputation. Your choice. Jesus, Gia. I didn't expect you to... Look, I don't want... fuck. We're gonna get through this, right? I'm sorry. I was pissed off at everything and everyone, except for you. You just made an easy target. And I was an asshole. I'm sorry, too. I don't know what I was thinking contacting her. I should have talked to you. When you wanted answers, I should've been the one to give them to you. I've got to take care of some things. I know what needs to be done. You, however, are out of it. No more, Gia. I can't have you getting involved in this nonsense. It's just too much, Hey, Gianna! Oh, God. It's Vincent. I'll take care of this. Yo, Gianna, I know you're in here, where is she? Shit. Vincent. You wanna tell me why I'm getting crazy calls from Deanna at work? Yeah, did she tell you what she's been up to? She's a reporter, Gianna. Writing news pieces is what she does. Is that the bull she fed you? No, what she's doing is wrong. And you're right? Back off, Rutledge. You put her up to this. - I did? - That's a lie. - He had nothing to do with this. - The fuck he did. You would never have done something like this if it weren't for him. How did you know about the pictures? I have your password. And you used it? You could have called me. I could've talked to her. You didn't have to do that. No, it wouldn't have worked. Vin, if I had any other choice, I wouldn't have threatened her. So you went with abusing my trust and putting me in the middle without giving me a heads-up? You cut me out, Gianna, instead of coming to me for help. That's not how this family works. That's how he handles dirt, not you. I didn't have enough time, Vincent. I was going to tell you. It's too late. Congratulations, douchebag. You just ruined the perfect girl. Vincent, wait! Come on! Let me handle this. He hit you? Promise me you won't leave. Wait for me to come back. - What, tonight? - No. Gia, I need more time. What? You can trust me. I love you. It's been two weeks, Angelo. He's just being stubborn. You know how Vincent gets. He misses you. Try calling him again. He hangs up every time he hears my voice. Well, then go to Rossi's and see him. Work this out. You're both miserable. I'm sick of it. Is Jackson still calling? Every night. He tells me he misses me, won't tell me anything else. Won't tell you where he is? No. He says he's "protecting” me. I know you don't want to hear this, but you shouldn't be with him, Gianna. He was changing you into something you're not. I love him, Angelo. As much as you love Denise. And you might be surprised what you'd do if somebody was threatening to spread her personal information all over the place. No I wouldn't be. I get that part of what you did. But Jackson's world, it's different and you know it. It's not the life for you. I love you, G. I don't want to see you hurt. Thanks. I'm sorry. Vincent, I need you to forgive me. I did that a while ago. You did? Why won't you talk to me? To punish you. Plus, I don't want to hear any excuses about what you did. Jax had nothing to do with how I handled Deanna. I don't know why he told you that. Because he knows he did. You handled the situation like a Rutledge, not a Rossi and you learned how to do that from him. You're right. Oh, shit, come on. Cut it out. I missed you. For fuck's sake, I was right here. Come here. I miss Jax, too. I haven't seen him since that night. He won't tell me where he is. I don't know what to do, man. Well, for starters, stop crying tough girl. Then stop worrying about Jax. The guy needs time to figure his shit out. Without me? It's his deal. However it goes, it'll be up to him to lay it out for you whenever he's ready. Okay? Yeah. Come on, let's get you a drink. Gianna. I was hoping to find you here. We need to talk. Is everything all right? I'm afraid not. Jackson gave me strict orders not to bother you, but we do need to talk. He's making a terrible mistake. How? He can't just walk away. The game is in his blood. And more than that, he has a responsibility to this country. He has what it takes to change the world in profound and necessary ways. He told me how you handled that reporter. You're an asset, Gianna. You're what he needs to reach the next level. I'm sorry, I'm not sure I'm completely clear on what we're talking about. With you at his side, he could make it all the way to the White House. The White House? Come on, are you kidding me? You don't believe he can do it? Yeah, Jackson can do anything he wants. He's amazing. Agreed. And as long as I'm in his life, I'll support him in whatever he chooses to do. But... But what? Do you know he blames the stress of a public, political life for his mother's alcoholism? He's stronger than she was. I think he's more worried about me, Parker. I know, I know. And that's why you've got to talk to him. Tell him you can handle it. Hang on. What I tell Jackson is my business. Period. No one else's. - Fair enough. - I just need to know where he is. He's in D.C. and I can get you there. Ready when you are. Gia. What are you doing? I have to take a call in a minute. What are you doing in D.C.? What are you doing in D.C.? Parker. He'll realize that I'm serious eventually. In the meantime, the bedroom's in there. Get naked and wait for me. Dream on. I've been doing nothing but dreaming of you the past two weeks. I've always seen white picket fences in your eyes when you look at me. I was positive I wasn't that guy. I was wrong. Jax... Hello? No, you heard right. That's why I wanted to touch base with you about reaching out to Parker moving forward. No, he won't be keeping me up to speed. I'm out. I'm getting married... Yes. Yes, that is a good thing, thank you. Good luck in your next election, Senator. You're still dressed. I don't sleep with engaged guys. I didn't say that I was engaged, yet. Didn't say I wanted to sleep, either. You're awfully sure of yourself. You're crazy about me. Or just plain crazy. So... this is where you've been, huh? I had to see my way clear of everything except you and Rutledge Capital. Jax, I didn't ask you to do that. No. But it had to be done. And I wanted to give you time to make things right with your family. My family put me in that position, not you. Seeing you and Vincent hurting like that, it shredded me, Gia. We worked everything out. I'm glad. But it wouldn't have been the last time. All that bullshit that I was feeding you about being strong and dealing with it? I said the same things to my mother the last time we spoke. I think they killed her. They killed in her the hope that she could save me from the life that she hated. I was young. Thoughtless. High on my own sense of self-importance and so convinced that my father was some sort of goddamned national hero. I didn't care that his ambition was destroying our family. I'm not going to do that to us. Nothing is worth losing you. I'm going to marry a sweet girl from a great family, and I'm going to keep her protected and happy. We'll have a few kids, a couple of dogs and the occasional barbecue with her obnoxiously overprotective brothers. Is that gonna be enough excitement for you? Absolutely. The only time I've ever been happy is with you. Your dad is going to have a hard time letting you go. Just so long as you don't let me go. Not a chance. Oh no, now she's gonna be a Rutledge. He's gonna be a Rossi. My baby girl.
