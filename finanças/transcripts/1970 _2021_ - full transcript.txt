Hello? - Warsaw, 16. - Gdańsk, please. - Of course. - Thank you. - Warsaw, 19. - Gdańsk, please. I will connect you. Hello? Was someone supposed to call Gdańsk? Hello? Gdańsk here. - I've lost Gdańsk. - It was connected. - Please connect again. - Very well. - Hello? - I have a call. Put it through. Weren't you on a call? - It got cut off. - One moment. Hello? PRODUCER DIRECTED BY Matejewski here. The Gdańsk shipyard, is that Remontowa or Lenina? - Both. - Really? - Yes. - And both are down? Partially working. Some have left. - Some are working and some not? - Yes. - And they're making trouble. - Yes. Assholes. When do we end this? Pietrzak here. What's the situation? They're installing speakers in the shipyards. - They want to start... - Agitating. We're installing equipment to jam them. Yes. That's the situation. Very tense. Świtała, hello. The workers are arriving at the main premises. - Yes? - In Gdańsk and Gdynia. They're not working but assembling around the management. They are demanding answers to their earlier postulates. In Gdańsk, in the Lenin shipyard, they have a committee. - Matejewski here. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What's new? - Who is this? - Kania here. I didn't recognize your voice. There's trouble in Gdańsk. Really? - A few thousand want to walk out of the shipyard. Demanding higher salaries and lower prices. They have slogans: ''Away with socialism'', ''Give us bread and wages'', ''Away with Gomułka'' is most common. Generally ''Away''. We'll have a meeting with the Chief soon. Comrade Sławczyk? - Who is this? - It's Pietrzak. Keep it short, I don't have time for speeches. In Gdańsk they aren't out on the streets yet. There's a large group of people on the move from Gdynia. Moving between Lenina and Remontowa shipyards. - What about Tczew? - Tczew? 500 aren't working. EQUALIZE COMMUNIST PARTY SALARIES WITH WORKERS' WAGES A FIAT - 300,000PLN BUTTER - 10PLN NAILS - 100PLN SAUSAGE - 20PLN WE DEMAND A 50% WAGE INCREASE ON STRIKE FOR ECONOMIC NOT POLICAL REASONS! Matejewski here. - I spoke directly with the shipyard. - Yes. It's all down. No one is working. He says they're coming back now. Groups of 10, 15 or 5 people. Back to their divisions, just sitting, not working. The situation is getting worse. There are threats that... if their demands aren't met, firstly, they'll go on strike, then they will burn and loot. They're also shouting hostile slogans. The strike committee in Gdynia were all arrested at night. We've locked them all up. Strike leaders in Gdynia. All arrested. Matejewski here. At 10 o'clock, so quite soon, they will meet at the port. They will march into the city from there. March into the city. PARIS COMMUNE SHIPYARD Końcewicz here, what's going on? Management of the Paris Commune shipyard are being held hostage, until the strike committee are released. If their demands are not met, regardless of the actions of the military, they'll walk into the city tomorrow. The W2 division of the Northern shipyard, it works for the military, are getting ready to walk out. - Ship Equipment Factory... - Yes? Approximately 100 people are not working. A sit-down strike. YES TO THE STRIKE! NO TO VANDALISM FIGHTING FOR BREAD NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT! LONG LIVE THE POLISH LABOUR FORCE! WE STAND WITH THE WORKERS NOT THE PARTY! SHIPBUILDERS, REMAIN CALM AND PRUDENT! - Matejewski. - Yes. Comrade Minister, a group of nearly 4,000 people, is approaching the Provincial Committee. As they passed a group of militia officers, - there were seven cars there. - Yes. They approached the militia and said if they won't let them pass, they'll get their crowbars and force their way in. Who do you think they are? Workers? Workers and a lot of young people. SHIPBUILDERS WANT THEIR DEMANDS TO BE MET They are angry and cursing the price hikes. The reason is simple. No meat was sold on Monday, on Tuesday meat was sold, everyone counted how much they'd spent. And so reality clashed with the theory. Two handwritten pamphlets: ''The price hikes are a result of an economic crisis in Poland''. ''Traitors of Marxism and Leninism of the Polish nation have caused this''. ''We must resist exploitation. Let's hold a general strike''. ''It will be supported by teachers, railway workers, clerks, and the labor force''. Day before yesterday there were no such slogans or appeals. Yes. - Pietrzak here. - What's on the air? Nothing about Gdańsk or events in Poland. Last evening there was broad commentary on Radio Free Europe. - What about? - The price increases. I don't give a shit about that. And Gdańsk? - Nothing at all! - Fine. Bye. - Just a quick question, sir. - I don't have the time for a Q&A, Comrade. Things are bad in Gdańsk. It's bad but we're not shooting yet. Bye. Good evening, Matejewski here. What's the situation? There are some 40,000-50,000 people marching. There are 40,000-50,000 people there? - Yes, in groups. - In smaller groups. - On the streets? - Yes. - Are they aggressive? - Yes, they are. I think you should have them dispersed! Do it vigorously! Bye! Hello? Our telegraph operators in Gdynia are on strike. They've informed they aren't accepting telegrams. But if they're on strike, I will have to halt all telegraph traffic, not only here but also internationally, as they might send something out. So I want to inform you that... Of course. Cut off their telegraph. - Cutting off telegraph traffic. - Of course. It's me speaking, Henryk. Yes, Stanisław calling. - Stasiu? - Yes. Listen. When are we getting more reinforcements? If you mean the militia... It's all there. That's all we're providing. In terms of the military, they should be there within the hour. - Listen. - Yes? In an hour things can get really ugly here. Świtała here. Who could inform us, within 10 minutes, what exactly is the current situation? One second please, I just ate some bread. The situation, in general, is currently very critical. According to my colleagues' assessment, approximately 50,000 people have gathered around the Provincial Committee. It'll get worse in the afternoon, the evening. In the afternoon? By then we'll move in all our forces there. - You'll get everyone from Piła. - Yes. - All of Piła, that's 500 people. - Yes. We're gathering chemicals and will send you another batch. Pietrzak. Comrade, are you already printing the pamphlets? They're printing! We'd already have 20,000 but... Kosicki came and made changes. He'll go in 10 minutes and then there will be 30,000 coming out per hour. When you'll have the first batch ready, let us know. We'll fly them to Gdańsk. - Siedlak please, Pietrzak here. - Good day. Of course. We heard there will be a rally at the print house at 11:00. At Dom Słowa Polskiego? How many people work there? - A few thousand. - What the fuck are you saying? You should have all the data right in front of you. How many employees? What's a couple thousand?! Fuck! We've had a revolution for four days! - Yes, sir. - For God's sake. - Yes? - Matejewski. How's things? - Reinforcements are being sent. - Yes. - Did they get inside? - No, they didn't. It was just reported they got in and shots were fired. Is that true? No, Comrade. I don't know anything about that. Please leave this area! Militia officers! Begin checking ID cards! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves! Thieves! So they're talking now. Any decisions? Indeed. Decisions will be made now. - I heard they will send the 16th Division. - Right. - An armoured division. - Yes. With tanks, we'll have Poznań all over again. - They'll surround it and that's it. - Well, maybe they won't need... - What? - Maybe it won't be necessary. - Exactly. - Yes. Let's hope. They have ten militia officers as hostages. So, ten officers are held hostage at the shipyard? - Got it. - Yes. - Hello? - Heniek? - Yes? - Matejewski here. Get a scribe and let's read out the latest directive. Yes, go on. Here it goes. By whom, you know. ''The use of weapons is allowed in the following instances.'' ''If the situation poses a threat to human life or health.'' ''If the following occur:'' ''an aggressive attack,'' ''on armed forces or the citizens' militia.'' ''If there are cases of arson,'' ''or other acts of aggression.'' ''Warn over the PA system, .'' Yes. ''of possible use of weapons'' ''by law enforcement officers.'' ''After the warning, if crowd aggression persists,'' ''warning shots, then shoot at the feet.'' Await further instructions. Come with us! Listen, what are the consequences of these actions? Our actions. These shootings. There aren't any. - Any casualties? - No, none. No? - Wounded militia? - Yes, 61. I see, 61. How many seriously? - Ten. - Ten seriously wounded. The Finnish consul is likely to have left Gdańsk. - He could have some photos. - Yes. I need approval to stop him under some pretense and take them away. Maybe a car accident. If he has a camera or a case, I would steal them. He could have something. I know that employees from other consulates, are on the streets, at first they were afraid, but are taking photos. - I report to Wiesław every 30 minutes. - Yes. I need only confirmed information. - The Central Railway Station is on fire. - The Railway Station? - Yes. - Understood. Got it. Is it crowded there? - Of course. - Got it. - Hello? - Yes? They're preparing to storm the prison. - The prison? - Yes. A division will be there in an hour. I spoke to Jaruzelski. Good. Now use the resources at hand. It's all you've got. Głowacki called and said things are bad. Yes. One building is gone, they've no chemical weapons. - And the army? - Hasn't made it yet. God damn it. Has Piła landed yet? Comrade Minister, I just spoke to... General Staff in charge of the flight and was told they didn't land, I mean, take off yet. - Piła hasn't taken off? - No. - You mean again? - No, first time, Comrade Minister. I don't understand. What is happening? An anonymous call was placed, that aircraft 003, which is en route to Gdańsk, has a bomb on board. Sociologically, this is a totally new phenomenon. In the past you needed a company to break up a crowd of 1,000. Now a battalion is useless. Yes, indeed. Different nature. Were they throwing Molotovs? Yes. It smashed some windows. Yes? Are people on fire in the Committee? The fire is on the second floor. There's no escape route. Are there soldiers and militia on site? Mainly soldiers, damn it. - And people are on fire? - Yes! Right now! Our forces are handling the crowd. - It's 20,000 strong! - Our soldiers are disarmed? How do you stand with guns and ammunition? Not great. What do you need, besides offensive weapons? The army has arrived. I don't know if they have enough manpower to disperse the crowd. The firemen couldn't get through. One access road was surrounded. I don't know if they were able to use the other one. Firemen can't get to them. How big is the crowd? About 8,000. - And 150 soldiers? - Yes. - The situation in Gdańsk is tragic? - Yes, it is. - I have more calls to make. - I understand. Take care. Things are not going well. Bye. - What's the current situation? - It's become critical. Yes. The second wing, the second floor is on fire. Either we'll shoot or... We can't evacuate... Yes. There's a crowd in front of the building. It's a deadlock. - The building is going up in flames. - So it'll burn. - We can't do anything to save these people. - You can't save those three men? The lower floors are on fire. They're on the fourth floor. What about a helicopter? The pilot said there's too much smoke. There has been no support, we won't last much longer. - Have you decided to use your weapons? - Not yet. But there is an order in case they break down the gates. We'll fire a series of warning shots. Then we'll resort to our weapons. - Karpik? - Yes? I send our warmest regards. Our hearts and souls are with you. Comrade General, we could use some chemical weapons. - Did they put out the fire? - No! It's still on fire? - They haven't started yet. - Yes? We want to get out two militia officers with a chopper. Rescue them? It's circling above the building. - How many people? - The Chief and two militia. They could jump. - The third floor? They'll die. - What if they use a life net? Whenever we make the space another wave of the crowd appears. Make enough space. We can't let three people die. That's what we want to do. They broke the rescue ladders. - Are the flames far? - Not very. Right. Not much time left. Fuck this! Sure. I believe you. - General Matejewski. - It's getting worse. They've cut their water off and now they can't put the fire out. - The situation is critical. - Indeed. I want to tell you that we've never seen such an aggressive and hostile crowd. - Unbelievable. - Yes. A new phenomenon. What's the scale of it all? It's tens of thousands of people! Henryk, those three people are still in the building. The building is on fire. They will most likely die soon. I'm aware of all the difficulties of staging a rescue operation. The crowd, the barricade, the trees. The helicopter can't approach. Henryk, I wanted to shake you up a bit. We think that in this situation one cannot wait with folded arms. Maybe the military could help. You need to get them out. Let them have half the city. Screw that! We'll take it back two hours later. We have the moral obligation to save them from burning alive. Do everything you can. Are there many of them? Quite a few teens, they're throwing rocks. Rocks? That's not so bad. Is the Committee on fire? - It's on fire? - Yes. The fire department has some access and is working. - Can you send us chemical agents? - They're on a plane. If we don't get them in time, we'll be sorry. We need to keep some, we don't know what will happen in Kraków tonight. Good idea. It's quite a commotion out there. - Excuse me? - I can hear the noise. - I don't understand. - What's with the noise? It's the protestors. They're throwing rocks. Put a wardrobe in the window. You don't want rocks flying in. The curtains protect us! Curtains are fine for little pebbles! If the army doesn't hit them hard, we'll last a few minutes. - It'll soon be over. - Alright. Hello? Hello? Hello? They lost contact with them 10 or 20 minutes ago. Damn it. - Yes? - Put me through. The Minister is in the bathroom. - What? - He's in the bathroom. I need him urgently. - The crowd is still attacking us. - Yes. The soldiers entered and stopped. The crowd surrounded the soldiers. Yes. They are agitating, throwing rocks. Understood. I can hear the shouting. - Excuse me? - I can hear the shouting. - I don't understand. - I can hear the crowd shouting. - What's happening by the Committee? - I can't say right now. Don't pick up if you don't have anything to say. - Yes? - We have the First Secretary here, we're fighting them off, we put out the fire twice. You'll need to decide when to use firearms! You have 30 combat vehicles nearby. And six tanks. They're on the streets already and should get through to you easily. Consider whether you could use a helicopter from the airbase? Fill it with chemicals and drop them at the crowd? Yes, sir. - Consider that option. - Yes, sir. Hello? - They've put it out? - Yes. - We're attacking now! - Got I! - First sign of defeat. - I understand. This afternoon we need to hit them with all we've got. Forcefully! - You got the three men out of the Committee? - Two. - Two? - Yes. Great. Congratulations, Henryk! They did a good job there! Comrade Minister, the army deployed its arms. They shot in the air. But due to combat vehicle use, there are 6 civilians dead and 19 officers wounded. And two Committee employees are wounded. Excuse me, Comrade Minister. Gdańsk called Comrade Pietrzak, asking for 2,000 flash-bangs. They're sending them flash-bangs. That's a little dangerous on the plane. I don't know what to do. I'm not the expert here! You decide! Don't ask me! You need to find out if it's possible. And then report. Yes, sir. - Pietrzak for Comrade Siedlak. - Of course. I just want you to know that Number One, said clearly today at 1:30pm. What? - He expects order in Gdańsk by tomorrow. - Yes. Strzelecki has asked the social and political authorities, to ask the people to maintain order and return to work. Those who walked out on their work, have created the conditions for street brawls. They provided cover for people, who have nothing in common with any of you. The answer to the question: ''What to do?'' is one: Return to your work! Starting tomorrow! Starting immediately! They were shooting... wanted people to join a national strike. We came to the local Committee... they persuaded people to work... - we want bread... - we started to attack... - they came to us... - not to increase prices before Christmas... we're not destroying anything, we're just demonstrating... In Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot a curfew is in place between 6pm and 5am. All public gatherings are forbidden, regardless of the time of day. Persons violating paragraph 1 of this decree are subject to appropriate penalties. Do not let yourselves be provoked by irresponsible troublemakers. Out of spite for the ruling Party, they have an agenda and it is at our expense. Members of the labour force! We appeal to your civic consciousness. Let us all ensure peace reigns in our city. Let us ensure peace for all factories, plants and institutions. Świtała here. - The crowd didn't react! - Yes? No reaction. They're just standing, no one ran away. We have two military divisions here! We need to fucking squash this! We can't negotiate when there are tanks on the streets! They'll cover them with pamphlets and spit on them, like in Czechoslovakia. But they're not giving up, so I'm suggesting... After 5-10 seconds from the warning, according to Wiesław's decision - shoot at the feet. - Yes. - That's the decision. Don't waste your energy on chasing all the groups, when you see a bigger one, just kick the crap out of them, get it? Gestapo! Gestapo! Gestapo! They are shooting! Murderers! Poles shooting Poles! They were going to work at 6 am and he was shooting then too! Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! Motherfuckers! Matejewski. - Were shots fired? - Yes. There are wounded. More shots now. Some people were taken to hospital. Pietrzak here. How are things? Today, in two larger brawls, there were 120 civilians wounded, of that 17 are in serious condition, of that 3 people have died. - Civilians? - Yes. I understand. They died from gunshot wounds or in fights? Gunshot wounds. - Hello? - Do you know how many are wounded? - Well? - It's 60. - So 60 wounded, and dead? - 11 dead. - Today? - Yes. Understood. THOSE GUILTY OF BLOODSHED MUST BE PUNISHED MILITIA! DON'T SHOOT AT THE WORKERS! INSTEAD OF A MASSACRE WE WEANT A PRICE CUT WORKERS' BLOOD WILL NOT BE SPILLED IN VEIN! PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORKERS' MASSACRE DOWN WITH THE ROTTING, RULING ELITE FAMILIES, DON'T WORRY - WE WILL PREVAIL WE CONDEMN THE MURDERS OF THE POLISH PEOPLE SZCZECIN ON STRIKE WE DEMAND IMPROVED LIVING CONDITIONS WE WANT A GROCERY STORE WE DEMAND FREEDOM OF SPEECH - Hello. - Greetings! - What's going on? - The Prime Minister will speak at 20:30. - Where? - On the radio, and television. Damn it. - Take care! - Bye. Citizens! The tragic events in the Gdańsk area, have made a deep impact on us all, but the duty of People's Party representatives, representatives of the State, their superior duty, regardless of the sorrow, is to think of the State. This will become clear to those who today were swept away by other emotions, as always they were used, by anarchists, hoodlums and criminals, as well as enemies of socialism, enemies of Poland. Lack of consideration has painful consequences, as does lack of sense of responsibility from people who walked out on their work, giving opportunity to louts, bullies and enemies, to vandalise, loot and kill. We ask of everyone, maintain your post, oppose any anarchist actions and defend order, rules and discipline! Building a house is no small task, it requires work, and toil. It is easy to set it on fire. Comrade Nowak, Świtała here. What's the latest? Comrade Minister, we've got three groups of 200-300 people. We keep on chasing them, they then disperse. We're arresting them, beating them with batons. They keep on regrouping. We can't handle them. Break up this scum, Comrade Nowak. We're doing our best. We should have sufficient forces. - These hoodlums need to be arrested. - Yes. Take the most prominent ones and prepare their biographies for show. For the press, radio and television. - Fine. - A criminal past, the rock throwing... And as many arrests as possible. - I said, they should report at least 500. - Rather 2,000. They're arresting these assholes like crazy now. They're working well. They've arrested 2,000 people and still going strong. A group of university students tried to build a barricade. We broke it down, arrested 12 and took them downtown. Right now, we are singling out people and catching them. The Committee building is being cleaned up. There's peace in Gdynia, Gdańsk, Słupsk and Elbląg. The market square is calm as well. Student dormitories are peaceful too. Comrade, each officer should get 200PLN extra. For expenses on duty. It's for emergency expenses, not a bonus or anything. God forbid, that would be embarrassing. Głowacki, congratulations! You have nerves of steel! Warm greetings from us. Keep fighting these bastards! I must tell you that these activities have our highest regard. One could use a holiday now! Warmest regards from me and the Minister! How's the Ministry of Interior? On a warpath Comrade General, as you can see. You wouldn't have managed without the army. The army is an essential part of the society. - Indeed. - Yes. - Us too. - Yes. Warm greetings, hope it all goes well now. - Thank you. - Goodbye.
