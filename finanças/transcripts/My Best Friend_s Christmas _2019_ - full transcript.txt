I want to thank you all for another wonderful year at Genuine Article. I couldn't ask for a better team. And as we head into the holiday season, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on what's truly important. Cue the champagne. So, let's raise a glass. To residuals, the gift that keeps on giving all year long. Cue the mailboxes, Katrina. To mailbox money! Now let's get this party started. And cue the music. Look at us winning. This party's a hit. Well, your smile certainly lit up the entire room. But, I mean, why else do you think I hired you. I thought it was my mother's well-connected business friends. Or it was your amazing work ethic and your Ivy League education. Hey, everything I've learned thus far, I've learned from you. - So, thank you. - Oh, thank you. Aww! Two turtle doves. That's sweet. Thank you. They're not just any turtle doves, they're turtle love doves. They bring good luck in love. Oh! So what are you implying, I need better luck and love? No. It would just be nice to see you give it a try for once is all. Okay. Thank you. Incoming. 9 o'clock. Ashley, I cannot thank you enough for putting all this together so quickly. - Everything is perfection. - I'm glad to hear it. And the holiday bonuses in the mini mailboxes? You're sheer genius. - I do what I can. - And all this food is beyond. Are they all Liam's personal recipes? Uh, his and his mom's. She has this amazing restaurant in Nashville... What's his story anyway? Are he and your assistant a thing or what? Oh, no. Definitely not. I tried. He said that she can't be contained. Oh, okay. So what about you and him then? Oh, me and Liam? Oh, wow. No. I mean, yes, we make a great team in business, but we are just friends. I don't think about him like that. I only use him for his "I hate crostini." Oh. Well, I suppose you won't mind if we somehow find ourselves under the mistletoe tonight. Oh, no. Go get him. Hmm. I must go and try the desserts anyway. Candy cane truffles look absolutely divine. - Those are always a hit. - Ooh. What was that all about? I think Deborah might have a crush. But what do you expect when you make your famous candy cane truffles? Hmm. She certainly looks, uh, thrilled. Hmm. Well, everybody does. Turned out great. Old parties by Ashley strikes again. Oh, your little catering thing helped. Oh? Well, that's why I do it, you know, for your unbridled praise and gratitude. Ashley, we need help. - Okay. Mm-hmm. Be right there. - Thanks. So, apparently, there's been a poi incident in the kitchen, which one of us goes? Sounds awful. - You go. - Oh. Well, fine. Looks like you have plans already anyways. Uh, suddenly, I'm very free, actually, so... Cheers. To another job well done and... to our third year in business together. Has it really been three years? - Wow, doesn't feel like it. - Mm-hmm. I know, time flies. Got to admit, pretty excited for a break. You don't know how to take a break. You're probably gonna be blowin' up my phone with a New Year's gig for us to throw together last minute. Or maybe Kwanzaa. That's only two weeks away. Oh, yeah, sure. So, uh, when're you headin' home? Supposed to be mid next week. Are you sure you don't wanna come? You know how much my parents love you. I mean, that does sound amazing. Oh, your dad's bad jokes. Ooh, competitive baking with your mother. Ah, well, she does make a better pound cake. Hm. That's true. And as much as I'd love to try my hand at that again, I already said that I'd water your plants while you're away, and since I'm a man of my word, I must decline. Hmm. Okay, if that's what you want. I just don't like the idea of you spending the holidays alone. Trust me, if I didn't want to be alone, I'd be spending the holidays in Hawaii with my mom, dad, and annoying sister, but why would I do that when I have my very own luau right here. Okay, fine, plus, I forgot about my plants anyways, so, yes, please stay. And we'll have, uh, New Year's again in two weeks like we always do, yeah? - Yeah. - Whether it's over a gig or... Ooh, a super expensive bottle of champs left over from this party. Let me go pull the van around. Oh, okay, yeah. I'll just keep an eye on things here. Oh. So helpful. - Hm. You're welcome. - Thank you. - Hey, let me just... - Oh, yeah, thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yes. Cute. Oh. That looks like the Lodge. But he never goes home for the holidays. Does he? All right, let's do this. Wow! Why do you look so guilty? I'm not guilty. What? - I don't look guilty. - Huh. You were stalking Grant again, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Mm-hmm. He liked my photo first, okay? I know, it's sad! I'm sad. Yeah, it's not sad. Creepy maybe, but not sad. You know, my sister always says, "It's only creepy if they're not cute," and you are, so... Ash, you guys were high school sweethearts. If you really think that there's still something there, then why don't you stop being such a weirdo and talk to him? And say what? I haven't seen him since high school, and we do talk... kind of. You communicate exclusively through comments on social media. That's not talking, that's distancing. Well, it's not a perfect relationship. But I just can't reach out to him anyways, I mean, he lives in New York now and I don't even have his real number anymore. You know, I don't even know why I bother. You always have some silly excuse. Can't I just have my crush? You can, if that makes you happy. It does. Then why do you complain so much? - Do I? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - I-I complain a lot? Oh, all the time. Hm. Okay. Didn't realize. Sorry. Oh. Whoa! Got to be faster than that, creeper. Yeah? No, you don't. No, you don't. Hm. Maybe he's come home. - Hey there! - Oh, my! Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! We have to document this. I hardly ever get to wear earmuffs. - Okay. - Oh, my goodness. I mean, I saw the photos, you know, but this place is not that busted up at all! Well, you know, I've been remodeling it for months now. You don't think I would go through all that trouble then build some dump. No, no, no, no, baby. No, no, of course not. - Not on purpose. - What? All I'm saying is that you and I have very different definitions of rustic. - How was your flight? - Uneventful. As was that terrible drive from LA. And dark. Harmony doesn't have much of a nightlife, does it? Hey, it's not Manhattan. Nightlife usually ends at 9:00 p.m., not 9:00 a.m. - Oh. - But it's nice. Yeah, I mean, I could, I could do... quiet for a couple of weeks. So, um, is there a bellhop or something? Well, for now, you're lookin' at him. - Oh, rr-r-r! Such service. - Yes, ma'am. All right, so, um, be a dear and please take my luggage to my room. And I hope you got me a room with a sunny view of the snowscape? Uh, it has a snowed since... It's quaint. You're gonna love it. You're gonna love it. - Quaint, okay. - Okay, I got it. Let's go. Thanks. My driver brought it up. Should be light. - Okay. - It's fine, it's fine. Is this all just shoes? Now where did I put... my tablet? - Mornin', sunshine. - Morning. You left your tote in the van by the leftover Hawaiian ham last night. - Classic Ashley. - Is there any other? I knew you'd be lost without your tablet and me. True story. - Whoa, you've already packed? - Yeah. I thought you weren't leaving till next week. Yeah. Well, plans changed, I'm leaving today. Um, why is that? Um, I don't know. I just don't have any more work, so I figured, why not? Well, then, I, uh... I guess I'm glad I brought you this. Aww. But we never exchange ornaments until Christmas Eve's eve. I know, but I knew that we weren't going to be able to exchange gifts this year since you're gonna stay home through Christmas, so I brought it with me so that you can take it with you when you go. Well, same to you. It's that one right there. You didn't think you were gonna catch me unprepared, did ya? I wonder how many of these ornaments are from me. Oh. Well, that would be exactly 32. Twenty-eight for each and every holiday event we've done together, and then the four that you've just given me for Christmas. Wow, I am super generous. And only 28 ornaments ahead of you. Man, they've really added up over the last four years, huh? This one is still my favorite, though. Ah, yes, well, it's not every day that you get to throw a sweet 16 for an old Chinese Crested. - That's true. - As for me... this one. - That one's your favorite? - Yeah. The big birthday party with the petting zoo? - Yeah. - You were mauled by a goose. I know, but despite it being a complete disaster, it was the first job that we ever did together. And the smoked goose that you served at the second event, that was a nice touch. That's when I knew we'd be a good team. Uh, well, I should probably let you finish packing. Okay. Thanks. I'm glad that I got to see you before I left. Me, too. Make sure you tell your family Merry Christmas for me, yeah? Yeah, will do. And if you change your mind about coming... - I'll make sure to call. - Okay. - Merry Christmas, Ash. - Merry Christmas. - I'll see you for New Year's? - Yeah. Okay. Don't kill my plants. - I'll try not to. - Okay. There she is! - Hi, sweetheart! - Hi, mom. - Oh, I'm so happy you're home. - Oh, thank you. - Hi. Gwen. Hi. - Hey, little sis. Oh, you look so grown-up in your fancy rags, I, I love it. I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Don't get used to it. You're still a little bug as far as I'm concerned. - Hi, Martin. - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? - Good. Hope my sister's treating you well. Well, when I'm on my best behavior, yeah. Yeah, that sounds about right. Uh, where's dad? He's at home, untangling the Christmas lights. He's gonna meet us at the tree lot. What? It's less than two weeks till Christmas, and you're just now hanging the lights and getting a tree? Excuse me, we were waiting for you. I mean, it is a special occasion with you coming home for Christmas so early. And it's a well-known fact that you are a far better decorator than the rest of us. Uh... Okay, so, why are you here so early? Not that I blame you, because why anyone would spend Christmas in the city is beyond me. I don't know. I just, I needed to come, I guess. Plus, it's nice to be home. Aww, we're so happy to have you, little Ladybug. It's gonna be a very good Christmas. I can feel it. Yeah. Me, too. So, tell us everything about LA. Oh, everything's great. We just had this big agency gig last night and it was a ton of fun, big success. So, yeah, it's good. And Liam, how is he? Liam, he's-he's fine. He certainly is. Oh, God, honey. Oh! Honey, I'll get some club soda, it'll come right off. Um, jeez. - Oh, no. - Your sweater. - Ooh, I love that smell. - Me, too. Vinny, Pearl? Good to see you. - Oh, my! - Hi. Is this Ashley all grown up? - Yes. Thank you. - Welcome home. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Let's go now before your ma catches us. Vinny, excuse us, we have a tree to sort out. Yeah? I'm telling you, the difference is incredible. We're no longer a Monterrey pine family. From here on out, it's only Scotch pines for the Seevers. You're really movin' up in the world. Huh, dad? I think so, I think so. But I need your help in convincing the rest of the family to spend some extra cash because they're still stuck in the past. Uh, well, I'll do my best. I know you will, honey. I know you will. Should we look in here? Uh-huh. This one's small, but I like her shape. Hey, Winston? Come look! You see what I'm sayin'? I gotta diffuse this before it gets out of hand. You pick our perfect Scotch pine. Okay. This Monterey pine is a bargain. That tree, I-it's got naked spots all over its northern expanse, honey. All right, thanks, Cliff. I'll, uh, meet you back at my truck. Hello? Wait, who is back there? Wait... Ashley? Grant, hi... Wow! It's so good to see you. What's it been, like, ten years? Oh, my... Uh, must be. Yeah, hey. It's really good to see you. Oh, my gosh! What are you doin' in the trees? Oh, that. I was just getting a closer look. I'm a real stickler when it comes to finding that perfect Scotch pine. You know, uh... Yep! Hey, just like I thought, no, uh, squirrels, so we'll take her. Box it up, please. Thanks. Uh, you have a little somethin' on your... Oh, I-it's designer. But, um, what are you doing home for Christmas? I thought your parents moved to San Antonio last year. - Uh, they did. - Yeah. Yeah, but I'm actually not gonna see 'em this year. - Which is a major bummer. - Hmm. But, uh... No, I, uh, moved back recently. You moved back to Harmony? Yeah, I did. I know, crazy, right? Yeah. I mean, you're so close to LA now. - I am. Yeah. - Yeah. Uh, anyway, I should, uh, probably go pay for my tree. Oh, yeah, I should probably go find my family. Yeah, so, uh, you know, I really wanna catch up, though. Are you, like, free tonight for dinner? Yes! I mean, I think so. Probably, I... If I have something, I could just move some things around. No biggie. Okay. Well, great. I have so much to tell you. You know, I feel like I've been living in our past. Really? Wow, I mean... Yeah, something about being back here I think makes me feel that way, too. Okay. Well, that's great. Um, uh, yeah, so can I pick you up at the... Where are you staying? Pick you up, like, 7:00? Yeah, sure, cool. I'm at my parents' house. Same place. Do you remember? I do. Of course. Okay. Um, well, I will see you then. See you then. Looking forward to it, um, Ladybug. You too, Mr. Hines. I mean, can you believe it? It's a date, right? He is picking you up for dinner? - That sounds promising. - Yeah. I mean, it's like a dream come true. And he moved all the way from across the country. It's better than a dream come true. Liam, this is a Christmas miracle. I'm happy for ya, Ash. - Thank you. - I hope it is a date. But maybe, uh, temper your expectations on the off chance that he just wants to catch up as friends. Liam, I really need you to be the wind beneath my wings right now. I mean, he even remembered my nickname. Only my closest loved ones call me "Ladybug," and he remembered. Uh, okay, fine. It is most definitely a date and he's probably gonna show up in a horse-drawn carriage or something. Thank you. That's exactly what I needed. So, how's home? Are my plants still alive? Um, you know, it's only been a day, but somehow I've managed to kill them all. Even the succulents. Oh, it's fine, it's not as exciting as your romantic rendezvous, however, which you should definitely be prepping for instead of talking to me. You're so right. I was just being polite. Anyways, I gotta go. Okay. Go have fun. And let me know how it goes, all right? Okay. I'll tell you everything after. Thanks, Lee. Bye. Come on, dad. It looks great. I mean, nobody can tell the difference. - I certainly can't. - Well, I can. Oh, honey. Oh, come on now. I tell you what. I promise, next year, we will spring for a Scotch pine. I'll even let you get it flocked. - Okay. - It's not what you think. - Oh. - I'll get it. I'll get it. Whoa, someone threw on a designer dress - and smells like... - winter spice? Honey, I thought we were decorating the tree tonight. Oh, uh, I'm sorry, mom. I actually made plans. - Can we do it tomorrow? - Well, I suppose so. But, what plans? With who? Well, I don't wanna jinx it and he's waiting outside, but I will give you every single detail later. I promise. - Love you. - Love you, too. Love you, honey. Wow. - Hi. - Hi. - You look great. Uh-huh. - Oh, thank you. Um... Y-you do, too. - Thank you. - Um, shall we? - Yeah. - Okay. So, what now? - What... - We spy from the window. Duh! - Is that Grant Hines? - It looks like it. Oh, my goodness. It's like prom all over again. Only now he drives a better car. Hmm. Okay, don't peek. All right. You're gonna love this. All right... Ready? All right. Open. Oh, it's the Lodge. - I missed this place. - Right? I've been doin' some work on it. - You wanna see? - Yeah. Come. Wow! You have really spruced this place up. I mean, the flowers and the candles... Yeah, it'll be for all the weddings and anniversaries, and romantic retreats this place'll bring. Yeah, it's very romantic. - Here, come sit. - Okay. - Oh! Thank you. - Yeah. So, I mean, how've you been? I mean, from what I see online, yeah, you've been, like, killing it. Thank you. Oh, yeah. I wish someone had told me how hard it would be to start my own business from nearly nothing, but it's good. I mean, okay, success aside, how are things going according to the life plan? Don't tell me you forgot. In school, you had a list of things that you wanted to accomplish by the time you were 30. - Oh, my gosh! Yeah. - Yeah. I can't believe you remember that. I have not thought about that in so long. Of course, and it was exhaustive. I mean, you had to start your own business, have a Lex SUV, a mansion in the Valley. Married, three kids... Two dogs and a... Oh. And... Wait, it was a closet with a... - Shoe station. - Yeah, a shoe station. Yup. Yeah. So tell me, how are we doing? Ah, well, um, cute house in the Valley, check. No husband, no dogs, but I do have a special spot for shoes. Wait, so you're telling me no one has locked up all this fabulousness yet? Hm. Okay, well, clearly there's a lot of foolish guys in LA. Um, so, earlier you mentioned wanting to tell me something? Yeah, I'm-I'm reopening the Lodge. - That was it. - Oh! Cool. Yay! Yeah, after five years of it being shut down, we're gonna have a grand opening in the new year. Great, awesome. That's... I, I'm really glad that I can be here to celebrate that with you. Yeah, me too. Yeah. Yeah, I-I know that we have a lotta history... and I'm just, I'm really glad that you reached out over social media to, you know, so we can stay, sort of, friends. And I know how much this place means to you. And we have a lotta good memories here and maybe tonight we could make some more. I'd love that. So would we. - We? - Dinner's ready! Ashley! Come here, Ladybug! Come, come, come, come, come, come! Oh! - Oh! Oh! Oh, thank you. - Mwah! You're so beautiful! Oh! Ashley, this is, this is Bella Vega. Hi! When Grant told me that I'd get to meet you, I got so excited. You're the only person on the planet that knows about us. Because of work, we had to keep everything private. - You know what I mean? - Okay. - Anyway, you guys ready to eat? - Yes. Um, it's only Thai food. I hope you like Thai. It's the only thing that's open in a ten-mile radius. This looks amazing, Bella. Thank you. - You promise? - Yes. Okay, should we eat? Um... I actually, uh, don't think that I can. - Wait, a-are you okay? - She doesn't look so good. No, yeah. Um, uh, I think I've g... I think I've gotta go. Sorry. Uh, sorry. It was lovely, a lovely, lovely night. Um, so... Oops! So great to meet you, Bella. Can we at least give you a ride? No, no-no. No? Uh... I'll, I'm gonna call a car, it's fine. Thank you. Sorry, thank you. They must think I'm crazy. You're not crazy. I bought him an edible arrangement from his favorite bakery in anticipation of our rekindled romance. Okay. You're a little crazy. But, that's still cute. So, you said he has a girlfriend now, yeah? Yeah, a super sweet, super nice, super famous one. Have you seen how many followers Bella Vega has? I mean, they pay her to be pretty and to promote pretty things. It's literally her job. So, wait a minute, what about all those flirty messages that you and Grant were sendin' each other all this time? Well, apparently, they were just platonic winky face emojis. Ashley, listen, I know you may feel bad right now, but this is gonna pass. And, honestly, Grant can't be that great if he's gonna choose her over you. She may be amazing online, but you're amazin' everywhere. - All the time. - Thanks, Lee. You always know exactly what to say to make me feel better. I wish you were here. Hey, you say the word, I'm there. Well, whatever that word is, yes. I guess I should turn in, though. Thanks for talking. - Night, Lee. - Yeah, uh, night, Ash. Coming! Coming! Coming! Coming! - Hey! - Hi! - Morning, sleepy head. - Good morning. Hey, um, sorry it's so early. Um, we just, we wanted to check on you after last night. Yeah, we were so worried, we felt badly and we just wanted to pop by and see how you're doing. Yeah, fine. Totally good. Sorry about that. Yeah, I'm fine. I mean, do you have any idea what made you so sick? Yeah, uh, um, it was... altitude poisoning. Oh, yeah. Altitude poisoning. - Uh-huh, you know. - Yeah. I've heard of that, yeah. Yeah, I think my body just needed some time to readjust, you know, the elevation and... Okay, well, we, um, wanted to see how you're doing, and I brought some freshly-squeezed juice. Some tonic to just flush that altitude poisoning right out. Wow! Thank you. That's actually... That's very sweet of you. Thank you. But you guys should go. Yeah, I'm... Uh, let me grab my coat. I just don't wanna get you sick, you know? We don't wanna inf-infect you. From, uh, altitude poisoning? Well, you know, you can't be too safe. Oh, yeah. But thank you so much for stopping by. - Okay. - So much. - I really appreciate it. - Hi. Did one of you order the Happy Holiday basket of baked goods? No. I don't think so. I think you have the wrong address. But thank you very much. Have a great day. - You sure? - Yes. The address matches for a "Ashley Seever?" That's you! Description reads, "Thanks for the perfect date, Mr... " Oh, hi! How are you? Yes. I f... Sorry, I totally forgot. - Um, do you want me to... - Please. Thanks. Okay, bye. Have a great day. I had a date yesterday before I came over. And I totally... Yeah, so good. So that's why you were dressed up like that last night. - Yeah. - That's totally why. It-it looks like it went great. - Mm... - Um... who's the lucky fella? Um... - Uh, hi. - Hey. - Liam? - Oh, hello, everybody! - Hi! - This weather. Ashley, look who I ran into in town. Yeah. Um... Liam. Um, guys, meet my boyfriend Liam. - Your boyfriend? - You sneaky guy! - We had no idea. - Yeah. Oh, and... this is for you, my wonderful, wonderful boyfriend. - Wow! Yum! - Yeah. Uh-huh. Yum. I just wanted to come up and spend Christmas with you guys, so... surprise! Well, we're so glad you're here! Welcome, welcome! - Yeah. - He's handsome! Uh-uh... I, uh... Liam, I'm Grant. I... um, I went to school with, uh, Ashley. Uh, you... Thanks. - Yeah, nice to meet you. - Yes. Yeah. Well, I'm Bella Vega. It's very nice to meet you, Liam. - Ooh! - You too, I... You're cute. Well, this has been great. Thank you so much for stopping by. - Appreciate it. - Uh, sorry. Please, drink that tonic. It'll flush it right out. - I will. Yes. - Okay? Here you go. Good to see you. Honey, take that around. - Bye. - Bye. See ya. - Okay. - Bye now. So, what is going on here? Um, I would love to tell you all about it, but first, I think I need to talk to my boyfriend. - Right, babe? - Right, babe. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Hm. I've always liked him for her. - Let's have breakfast. Shall we? - Hm... Oh, my gosh! We're dating now? Yeah, I don't know. I panicked. I mean, he asked about the basket and I couldn't tell him it was for him. That would've sent me down a whole shame spiral. And then it's like you magically appeared and saved the day. So, why did you magically appear? Well, I knew that you felt bad and, you know, after I talked last night, I felt awful, and, and you said, whatever the word is, you were sayin' it, so I drove up first thing this morning. It's actually really nice. Um, who's watching my plants, though? Oh, Katrina's taking care of them. - Okay. - Wait. Now will you focus, please? - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. Thank you. - Focusing. - All right. - So, we've lied to Grant... - Uh-huh. His girlfriend and your entire family about bein' in a fake relationship. - Yeah. - Wait. What are we supposed to do now? Well, I don't know, but I would rather have altitude poisoning than explain this to Grant. So... Hm. Well, maybe we can fake a breakup. No! That's too suspicious. And, plus, I don't wanna spend Christmas being fake sad about a fake breakup. Mm, yeah, and your family is kind of hosting me for the holiday, so that'd be sort of awkward. - Right. - Maybe I could just leave again. No, I don't want you to leave. I like having you here. Which, I guess, leaves us with only one option. - You want us to keep pretending? - Just through Christmas. All we have to do is spend a bunch of time together, which we already do, and sprinkle in some hugs and some hand holdings, and when we get back to LA, we can stop pretending, and in another few months I'll just call 'em and I'll be, like, "Oh, hey, we broke up. Sorry." You know how crazy this all sounds, right? I know. But did you see my mom's face when I blurted it out? She was so excited. Trust me, this is the right thing. Okay. Fine. I will be your fake boyfriend for Christmas. Really? Yeah, sure, I mean, I already know all things Ash, so how hard could it be, really? Maybe a little harder than you think. Bella already invited us to go ice skating tonight. Okay. I mean, that's pretty casual, right? It's couples' night on the ice. Okay. Perfect. Um, I guess we better put on a good show then, huh? Yeah. - I forgot how good you were. - Hey, guys. - You did? - I did. Well, here, let me remind you. - Ooh! - Guys? Guys, guys, guys? - Oh! - Aah! We need to take a breather in-in case I break something. - So... Whoa! Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay. Spicy eggnog malts on me! Okay. Do you, uh, do you want some help? - No. No, I'm good. - You sure? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you sit. No, no, skate, skate. - Yeah, I'll go. I'll go. - Go skate. Aah! You can't carry them all on your own anyways. I'll be back. You boys behave. Okay, come on. Easy. Whoa! Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Mm! This is so good! How many calories do you think are in... Don't ask. Just drink. He's really great on the ice, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Can I, uh, can I ask for your opinion on something? Yeah. So, uh... you and Ashley, huh? How long has that been going on? Oh, uh... it's, uh, pretty fresh. I mean, we've been working together for years, but, uh... it honestly feels like we've just started this relationship. Ashley always had a way of keeping things fresh. Oh, that's right. She mentioned that you guys went out in school, yeah? We did. "Mr. and Mrs. Harmony High." - Ah. - She was really something. So, I know Grant and I have only been together for, like, three months, but I kinda feel like there's something off. Does that make sense at all? Off how? Well, I feel like, like we're not moving. Like we're always toeing the line between dating and being in a relationship, you know? But you came out here for Christmas, so... Oh, yeah, right. But, you know, and partially that's my fault. You see, my publicist, um, doesn't think that being in a relationship is good for my brand. And so, even the dating has been... quiet. But what am I supposed to do when he just up and moves back here? Like, I literally have to force my way into spending Christmas with him, especially, since my family lives in Tokyo. Tokyo? Yeah, that's why I speak fluent Japanese. Can I ask you a weird question? Uh... why exactly did you and Ashley breakup? Well, trust me, neither of us wanted to. But I got accepted in Boston, and she got accepted over in LA. We talked about doin' the long-distance thing, but, I was just more of a realist. We came to a point where it wasn't realistic anymore. Anyway, I'm sorry. I don't mean to just unload all of this on to you, I just... I have nobody else to talk to. And, um, you know, you and Grant tick pretty close. Yeah. Honestly, anytime. I totally understand how you feel. He can be frustratingly sweet and charming. And that can make it hard to tell where you stand with him sometimes. Right. I know. It's just, I feel like I'm pushing too hard. You know, maybe if I just, I step back? Maybe you should. Yeah. I mean, this whole party thing was my idea. I am literally volunteered to spend Christmas Eve hosting this-this big event just to impress him. Well, do you still think it'll work? Maybe. I don't know. But what I do know is that I am in way over my head. - Oh. - Yeah. And all I really have is a great guest list. And I do mean great. I mean, I have a ton of influencer friends who are gonna plug this place until it's booked up at least a year in advance. But, wrangling everything else feels like a real rodeo. - Yeah. - All right. All of you holiday lovebirds, it's seven oh seven, and you know what time that is. It's time for a ho-ho-ho... - Yeah? - Yeah. So, grab that special Mr. and Ms. Claus in your life and head to the rink. - Oh, look. - Hi! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! Ladies, you heard the DJ Santa. No, it's a hard pass for me. I'm still enjoying my malt. Yeah, I need to take a break, too. I've nearly fallen three times, and those guys up there keep laughing at me. But why don't you go skate with Grant? Hey-yo, Ladybug, game if you are. Ooh! - Bye! - Okay. Okay, come on. Oh! It's been a while since we did this. Yeah. We used to skate circles around every other couple. Hey, I think we still got it. - Yeah? - Yeah. Come on. Aren't they cute? It's, uh, real cute. Oh, yeah. Thanks again for inviting us tonight. - That was so fun. - Oh, of course. I just, I hope that we get to hang out again before the holidays. Oh, I was thinking... I don't know if Grant told you, but I'm an event planner, so I'm sure you'll have great plans for the Christmas party. But if there's anything that you need help with, just let me know. - Ashley, are you serious? - Yes! I love the Lodge. I have so many great memories there. And, plus, my job is awesome, so it doesn't even feel like work. Hm, I guess that means you're gonna be spending a lot more time there, too. Oh, wow, yeah, I didn't even really think about that. I'm so excited! Yes! I think the more, the merrier. Uh, if Grant's okay with it. Are you okay? Uh, yeah, sure! I mean, I think it's a great idea. Plus, we'll get to relive all those old memories like we'd hoped. Only, now, we'll go make some them all new. So, it's settled. We'll come by tomorrow and get a jump on things. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. Everything's... I know, it's gonna be great! This was supposed to be a holiday break. I just don't understand why. What do you mean? Grant is my friend and this is important to him. Not to mention, we literally do this for a living. Okay. You sure that's all? There is nothing else prompting this saccharine, sweet proposal? Because yesterday you couldn't wait to escape the two of them. I don't know what you're getting at, but just because you're my fake boyfriend, it does not mean you can be fake jealous. I am not jealous. - No? Okay. - Fake or otherwise. I just don't want you to make a giant mistake. - Oh. Thank you. - Wait a minute. You're not actually thinking that you still have a chance with him now that you know he's taken, right? Kind of taken. Bella said it herself. They're very loosey-goosey. Plus, you saw how he was with me tonight. Clearly, there's still something there. Wow! Um... You are really wrapped up in all this nostalgia, aren't you? Spirit of the season. Holiday romance. Plus, I mean, around every corner. Wow, you're really making this into something it's not, aren't you? And it's not any of your concern. Okay. If you say so. Just don't come runnin' to me when this all blows up in your face. Oh, I won't, because the only thing blowing up will be my phone after we send out the invites. - Hm. Great. - Great. Good. - Fine. - Fine. Wait, wait, can I get some marshmallows in this? Thank you. It's good. - Cheers! - Yay! Holiday party! I cannot thank you guys enough for helping me with this. Oh, of course. We're happy to. And I gotta say, this place is pretty spectacular. Oh, my gosh, you should've seen the Lodge in its prime. I mean, this place was the staple of Harmony. When Grant and I were dating, we threw some pretty amazing parties here. We sure did. I mean, especially at Christmas time, sometimes I felt like the entire town was here. - Oh. - I think they were. Um, anyways, I was up all night thinking of ideas for the party, but I don't wanna step on anyone's toes, so why don't we start with you guys telling me what you think needs the most help and we'll go from there. Honestly, it's probably a good question for her, because she's been handling the party and I've been making sure everything is in order for the real opening. You, I'll-I'll... Okay. Um... Well... Um... It's not a lot. You know, it's, um, we just, we're just tying up some loose ends, so we're... Okay. Um, like what? - Yeah, like... Hm? - Like what? I told you. I told you about the guest list. We have the guest list. It's a great guest list. - Perfect. - Beautiful. Yeah. - And what else? - And then, we have the venue. The venue is... - Oh, it's great. Yeah. - Yeah. So, no decorations or... - That's it. - Oh. Okay. Well, I mean, this is like a big, grand opening Christmas Eve shindig, right? So, we probably want more than just your average household items, right? I mean, we need to be thinking bigger here, right? - Absolutely. - Okay. - Absolutely. - What about food? - Yeah. - Do, do you have a caterer? No. No, we have the restaurant. So, the restaurant will handle it. So... With, uh, less than a week's notice? This is their busiest time of year. Eight days. It's not a week. - Well... - Yeah. Luckily, we have Liam, who is a rock star. - Fantastic. - Okay. Great. So, music. Oh, music! Mus... Yes! My, um... Okay. My CrossFit playlist is literally the jam. Yeah? So, I was thinking we just plug that into the speakers and just let it, like, rock the space. It'll fill in beautifully. - And that could be awesome. - Mm-hm. Um, or maybe we could ask the local DJ Vinnie, the guy who played at the ice rink, in the Santa suit. I mean, don't be fooled by the hat. He can really turn it out for a party. I think he'd be great. I think that's a, that's a, that's a great idea. I think that's a great idea. - I think it's great. - I think it's great. - Okay. Um... - Great. And then we can do holiday Christmas beverages. We'll need tables, chairs, place settings... Maybe we can just take these tables and move them to the gray room. - Love it. Okay. - Yeah? Cool. Okay, well, I think that-that's pretty much it for now, right... Oh, of course. Theme. I mean, I'm sure you guys at least have a theme already, right? Yeah, it's Christmas. Christmas is the theme. That's fine! Okay, we'll figure it out. We have worked with a lot less before. - It'll be fine, so... - Mm-hmm. Yeah. We have a lot of work to do, so who wants to go shopping? - I do.

I don't know what would've happened if she didn't help me. Ah. And... we now have our theme. "Home for the holidays." That feels good, doesn't it? It really does. Reminds me so much of how my parents decorated it for the holidays. That's exactly what I was going for. I remember when your parents had me over for Christmas, and it just felt so warm and magical and it just felt like home. Uh, well, then... I think I'm gonna start cleanin' up. Gotta get back to your parents. Ah, Liam, let me help you with that. Oh, no, it's fine. I got it. No. No, no, no, no. It's okay. I will help you. You're such a dear. - Here you go. - Thank you. The place looks really great, Ashley. It brings back a lotta memories. A lot of really good ones, too. You know, I wish it was spring because I would love to throw a party over in that garden. That was always my favorite place here. Oh, mine too. Do you remember over here... You know... right there is where you and I... Our first kiss. Right before prom. That is not the kind of night that you forget, even in our old age. It's weird, you know? I know we haven't seen each other in years, but... seeing you back here just makes me feel, like... I don't know, just, like, not a day has gone by, especially the more that I see you. Yeah. I mean, this place is like a time capsule to the past. To a place where it kinda feels like we never really left. Yeah, well, we certainly really never stayed and say goodbye. Oh, well, that's because I didn't know we were gonna have one of those. All right. Yeah, I-I, um... I don't know, it just sorta happened. I'm sorry for the way things turned out. Oh, don't be. That's life. Plus, we both turned out okay, didn't we? Did we though? I know, lately, being back here just makes me... I don't know. I'm not so sure. Hey, Grant, can you come here, please? - I should... - Yeah. Go ahead. Mm... You have been unusually smiley the past half hour. Did something happen that I should know about? No. Okay, but you can't tell anyone. Grant and I had a moment. - A moment? - Uh-huh. Uh, what does that mean? I don't know. There was just a spark and it was perfect. - Um, Ash? - Mm. You know I care about you, right? I know what you're going to say. It's not just my imagination. He felt it, too. Okay, then what about Bella? Oh. Well, she's more friend than girlfriend, and they live in two different states, and she has no intention of moving out of New York. And you have no intention of leaving LA. So what? But that's less than three hours away. We could make that work for a while. Ash... what if this is just residual sparks, huh? I mean, how much do you have in common with him anymore anyway? You've been back in his life, uh, what, a few days and all of that you know about him is from his social media. Okay. Look. I know you are just looking out for me, and I appreciate that, but please just be happy for me, once. You're the one who's always telling me, "Don't work so much" and, "Go out on more dates." That's what I'm doing. I'm just giving something a chance. All right. Fine. I just don't wanna see you hurt. Well, thank you, but I know everything is gonna turn out perfect. I can just feel it. - They're here. - Good evening, family. Well, somebody's in a good mood. Did you buy her something special for Christmas or what? Nope. There's just so much magic in the air and joy and peace and love and all that good stuff. Can't you feel it? Hot buttered rum from Frittella's, am I right? - All right. - Yeah... Not an ounce of alcohol running through her veins, so... I'm just happy to be home. And what a Christmas it has already been. Okay. We've been waiting two days. Jackets off. Let's decorate this tree. Fine. As the baby of the family, it's usually my job to put the star on the top, but I'll let you do it. Oh, thank you. What a kind and considerate girlfriend you are. I know. Liam, Ashley tells me that you like ornaments even more than she does, which I find hard to believe. I actually do. I mean, they all tell a story, right? Oh, reel it in, ornament nerd. Let's start with these, shall we? You seem giddy. I take it things are going well with Liam. That's definitely it. Your mom and I always knew you'd end up together. - Okay, dad. - That's true! It's true! - Here you go, sweetie. - Thank you. Um, wait a minute. This guy has to have a story. Oh, that's a Christmas story for the ages. Have you ever been fishing in Cancun at Christmas time? - Hm. - Oh, yeah, we have. So, what do you think, front and center, or? - Yeah. That's good. - All right. Here we go. Um... Well, looks like we get to do it together this year after all, huh? You brought them! Thank you. May I? The poi incident. Uh... I love it. - Thank you. - Of course. Your turn. You always get me ornaments that remind me of our memories, so I thought I had to do the same for you. - Oh, my gosh, you remember that? - Mm-hmm. - Oh! - A good one. Yeah. - The banana... - Banana... - It's perfect. - Mm. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Well, what are you waiting for? Are you gonna kiss or hang 'em up? - Uh... - Yeah. - Let's see, what do you, what... - Here? - I think that's perfect. - Okay. What about, um, here? Yes. Perfect. - I think it looks pretty good. - Hmm. It really does. - Thank you for helping. - Kidding me? I love your family. It's been great. Oh, all except for the part where your dad got really mad 'cause his fish ornament was too heavy for the branches. Anyway, I know I kinda crashed your family Christmas, but... thank you for having me. I had a really good time, you know, despite the whole "we're dating" thing. Right. Yes. But it was great. And I'm sorry that we haven't been able to spend some more one-on-one time together lately, but it was nice hanging out, just us tonight, a little bit. Having you here makes it feel like my whole family's together. - Oh, goodness. - Oh, God. I think that's our cue to turn in. - Goodnight, everybody. - Goodnight. Yeah, goodnight. Yeah. I'm pretty tired, too. Oh, yeah. M-me, too. Uh, see ya in the morning? Yeah. Bright and early. Early. Right. Goodnight, Ash. Goodnight, Lee. You are... Hey, guys! - Hey! - Hey! - Hi! - Hi! We were actually just out shopping for the Christmas party. Oh, yeah? Uh, did you guys find anything good? Yeah, actually, we started off at the grocery store and stalked upon all the supplies that we need, because Liam is making his famous turkey and dumplings, and his stellar pumpkin cakes with butter cream cheese icing. - Oh! - Oh, my God. That sounds amazing. Liam. And then we picked up a bunch of goodies from the gift shop so that we can make swag bags for all the guests in which I will then label "Especially delivered by Santa himself." I love the idea! Oh, m-me too, Ash. I mean, I love it. Thank you. Um... Uh, do you guys want to join us? I mean, we haven't even ordered yet. No, no, no, that's okay. No, no, no, please! Please, Liam! Please, Ashley, please, sit! - Yeah, okay. It'll be fun. - Sure. Perfect. This food is really great. I gotta say I'm impressed with old Harmony. - Yeah. - Mm. Yeah. I mean, Ash and I would come here when we were kids. It was our fav. That's great. Ash and I actually have a spot like this back home, too. We basically moved into the Gwendal the last year, didn't we? Mm-hmm. Uh, it's so good. And they have this slightly-charred sourdough that they bring out for first, and it is the best bread... The best bread you'll ever butter. Hey! You said that the first time we went there four years ago, and I'll never forget it 'cause it's totally true. Oh! Okay, everyone. This next one is a personal favorite of mine, so I wanna see all of you out here on the dance floor, you hear me? Let's get into that holiday spirit. What do you think, guys? Shall we? Don't tell me you can't dance. Oh, on the contrary, I was born a dance TV OG. - Shall we? - Are we really gonna do this? Yes, ma'am, we are. ♪ Don't hang my stocking on the fireplace this Christmas ♪ ♪ There'll be one less cup of cocoa to make ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm needed far away and I can't find a sleigh... ♪ Isn't that DJ Santa over there? - Hi, Vinnie! - Hi, guys, how are you all?

Not to mention, I turned down at least two personal appearances and at least one closet's worth full of couture just to be here with you. I know. I know, okay? I-I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean anything by that. It just, it... that came out wrong. - Okay. - Okay?

No, looks, uh, looks pretty good. Mm, no. It's wonderful. You're just jelly 'cause you can't even bake ready-made pizza without burning the edges on every side. Sorry, Grant, I think that means it's three to one and all of these make the cut. Yeah. Which means, our menu is done. Hm, these Christmas Santa stocking stuffers are such a cute idea. I love it. Yeah. These beauty supplies are gonna be a treat. Your guests will wanna keep coming back for too. Nice. Liam, nice work. You keep that up and we'll be done in no time. Oh, my baby bear, it's not a race. Okay? It's okay. So, this will be our buffet station, and with the chairs out, it will force people to mingle as they jingle. - Ooh. - Wow. Uh, ho. Nice work, Grant. Oh. It's okay. It's cute. All right, I think this is the last one. Oh, my gosh, I can't believe your parents kept all these for so long. Right! These are perfect for the party. Vintage like the Lodge. Yeah, well, they're the same ones they used when they first opened. I'm gonna take some of the empties down to the cellar. I'll help. Hm. What are you doing? Go ahead. I'll just be a few minutes. Are you sure? It's freezing out here. Yeah. I'm fine. I'm still a mountain girl at heart. Plus, I got my boots. All right, Ladybug. Don't let your wings freeze shut. Looks nice, doesn't it? Even more beautiful than I remembered. Ash, I'm not imagining this, am I? Imagining what? I don't know. I mean, maybe... Maybe it's just us both being back here... or maybe it's me seeing you with someone else for the first time in, like, forever, but... - No. - I kind of feel, it's... I know what you mean, and I felt it, too. You do? I knew you did. You know, look, I know our lives went in different directions when we were younger, Ash, but... I mean, it brought us back here. And I don't know what that means, but... I know how it makes me feel. Liam calls me Ash. Grant, it's my fault. I'm the one that's making you feel this way. I was hoping to see you when I got here. I was hoping to run into you and I was hoping that you'd be single. But then, I met Bella, and she's so sweet, and she's wonderful and... - But you love Liam. - No. I mean, yes, of course, I love Liam but I'm not in love with Liam. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. - That-that was... - Grant? Um, Bella. Wait, no, no, no. Bella. Bella, Bella! Bella! Bella! - Listen... - I don't... I didn't mean for any of that to happen. Grant, Grant, please, just stop! Just stop! No! I saw the way you've been looking at Ashley lately. You still have feelings for her which means, I got really bad feelings for you. - Can we just talk about it? - No! If you'd just let me explain what's on. No! I will not hear anything you have to say. Listen, listen, just, can you please calm down? Nothing. No, don't you dare touch me. I swear to God, if you touch me... Bella, just... Bella... I don't care. - Listen to me. - I'm leaving. - Calm down, okay? Please. - No. My God, what's wrong with you? I just wanna talk about this. Please? Okay... What's goin' on in there? Uh, Grant kissed me in the garden. - I know, I know, okay? - I don't care. I do not care. Do not. Where're you gonna go? Y-you can't just leave the Lodge. Just, please just stay. You are deader than fish! - Bella, come on. Bella! - No! - Can you just listen to me? - No! Bella, come on, can you just, please stay here tonight until you have somewhere else to stay? All right, you can have the master bedroom with the big closet, it's all yours. You don't even have a plane ticket till next week. Where are you gonna go? There are plenty of bed and breakfasts out there. I'm gonna come back tomorrow to pick up my coats! Bella, what are you... Come, just listen to me. Why did you let him do that, Ash? I don't know. I have to stop her. So, you're gonna leave? You're leaving? I will hear nothing you have to say. Nothing! - Bella... - Bella, wait. What you saw there is on me, okay? Grant never would have kissed me if I didn't confuse him into being jealous of me and Liam. And I did it on purpose. I don't understand. Why would you cheat on Liam? He's wonderful. And why would you try to take Grant away from me when you know he's mine? I didn't cheat on Liam... because he's not my boyfriend. The truth is, we're just friends. We were just pretending to go out so that I wouldn't look like a fool in front of the two of you. It wasn't planned. I just... I dug myself into a hole and he was sweet enough to go along with it. Grant... I messed up. When I first got here, I thought maybe you still had feelings for me, because I definitely still had them for you. And then, you invited me to dinner and... I made a mistake. And when I realized that, I was mortified. I shouldn't have let it get so out of hand. I'm sorry. No, you knew. You knew. You set me up to get hurt because you thought I was some silly social media hashtag without any real feelings. You two deserve each other. - Bella, this is... - Grant, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? Just go home, Ashley. Party's off. Let's go. - Just get outta here. - Liam, I can't just go. I have to do something. I really think you've done enough. I'll be out by the car. I don't understand why you have to leave too. I know you don't. And that's the problem. If you have something to say to me, Liam, just say it! Please! Being here this week... it's been great. I've loved to getting to see all of Harmony. Being around your family where you grew up, but it has also been torture. When I held you on the dance floor... that, that just felt right. Then I thought maybe we could be something more than friends, maybe you felt it, too, but... Why didn't you just tell me that then? Because I don't wanna be a backup plan, Ash. Your second choice, after Grant, the one that got away. You're not a backup plan. You know you mean more to me than that. You know you do. I think we need some time to cool off. - I'm leaving in the morning. - Please don't leave like this. Maybe when you get back to LA after the new year, we can just pretend that none of this ever happened. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. Nobody to blame but myself. Did you try talking to Grant? Yeah. He won't respond. I basically crushed his whole plan to have a big grand opening for the Lodge, so... Seems like you need some of my hot cocoa coffee and a good old-fashioned Christmas miracle. Thank you. Sweetheart, there's got to be some way to save this party. It was supposed to be tonight, and it's kinda hard to have a party without a host. Plus, half the guest list is just Bella's influencer friends who are supposed to plug the Lodge and... Liam left, so we don't have food. I've never seen him look so disappointed. You and Liam will always be friends. He will forgive you. I promise. I think he was right though. I don't know if I wanna just be friends anymore. Did you tell him that? Well, then, young lady, I think you've got some more work to do before Christmas. You can't not tell him how you feel. I just wish I could take everything back and make it right. Yeah, you'll think of something. If you put your mind to it, there is not a thing not one thing that a Seever cannot do. Especially our little Ladybug. Well, everything I learned, I learned from you two, so... And me. So, what happened here? Why all the sad faces? The little Ladybug's home for the holidays. I need happy faces, now. Come on, y'all heard her. Smiles up! "Home for the holidays." That is our theme. Oh, my gosh. Home for the holidays. I can fix this. I can fix this! I can fix this.

Maybe he thought he did. But it wasn't real. It was just a fantasy. And I know that because I felt the exact same way. Yeah? Well, it still doesn't excuse what you did. I know. But I want you to know that that was some insecure little schoolgirl tryin' to steal Grant back. Some silly girl that could never compete with the Bella Vega. Hmph! And that girl is not the real me. Yeah? Well... if you were really dating Liam, I'd try to steal him from you just to exact my revenge. That's fair. Even though Grant is totally dead to me. Bella... I-I know Grant still cares a lot for you. I can see it in the way that he is with you. And I know him better than anyone. You really think so? I really, really do. I mean, I even considered moving here just to be close to him. I mean, I think I kind of already did. - I just haven't told him yet. - Oh, good. Don't throw away your chance at love over one mistake that wasn't even entirely his fault. Trust me. What I did cost me something real with Liam. Don't make the same mistake I did. - What's this? - A peace offering. If you still care for Grant, at all, please consider it. At least one couple deserves to be happy. Anyway, the choice is yours, but thank you for hearing me out. And, Bella, if I never see you again, I really am sorry. And I actually think we would have made great friends if I hadn't royally screwed everything up. Anyway... Merry Christmas. Hey, Grant. Ash, what are you doing here? You hired me to do a job and I intend to see it through. Ashley, no one's gonna come. I mean, we haven't given them any notice. They will show up. They'll remember. Those people love this place just as much as we always did. They'll come. I know that they will. Look, I haven't forgiven you for what you did. And, you know, I haven't forgiven myself. You don't have to forgive me now, or ever. But don't let the Lodge suffer for my mistake. Our mistake. Our mistake. Now you should go get ready before people start showing up because as much as I love this mountain man bachelor look, it's not really appropriate for the party. You're ridiculous, little Ladybug. So are you, Mr. Hines. Now go get ready. You've got a party to host. ♪ Ho ho-oh ho ♪ H-ho ho-oh ho ho ♪ He brings smiles everywhere ♪ He go-o-o-o-o-o-oes ♪ Smiles everywhere he go-o-o-oes ♪ ♪ Ho ho-oh ho h-ho ho-oh ho ho ♪ ♪ He brings smiles everywhere ♪ He go-o-o-o-o-o-oes ♪ Smiles everywhere he go-o-o-oes ♪ ♪ Don't look up the chimney ♪ He's not under the tree ♪ You can't buy it in a store his gift is free ♪ ♪ It's all over children's faces ♪ ♪ It's not about the toys ♪ It's just once-a-year delivery ♪ ♪ Of smiles love and joy ♪ Ho ho-oh ho h-ho ho-oh ho ho ♪ ♪ He brings smiles everywhere... ♪ This is so beautiful.

Ashley, I-I... I don't know what to say. I mean, this is all just, it's amazing. Well, this place is amazing and everyone remembered. But, unfortunately, I think it might mean you're gonna have to do this every year. Well, there's definitely worse problems to have. It looks like some of Bella's influencer friends came. I wish she was here to see this. I mean, this was originally her idea. Finally getting the credit I'm due? Bella. I'll let you two catch up. Wait, how did you... I didn't think I'd see you again. I wasn't planning on it. But Ashley did pay me a visit and she told me everything. And she said that I would be stupid if I let you off the hook that easily. - She did? - She did. Well, I'm happy that you're here. I just, I didn't want you to leave. And I was... It was just in my head, and I was consumed with... No, I know, I know, and I'm sorry, I've been waffling abou... You know what, it wasn't your fault. No, no. I spoke to my publicist and I told her that I don't want to keep my feelings a secret anymore. But I'm telling you, I am not moving here. - Okay. - But I will stay in town. And help you until you get this beautiful place up and running. - You will? - Yeah. I will. Under one condition. Okay, what's that? Name it. I want you to teach me how to ice skate like you did with Ashley, 'cause it was so dreamy! All right. Deal. - Mm. - Mm. - Whoo. - Ooh. Cute lights. Eating cake on the clock. Hm. What are you doing here? Well, I almost went home... until I realized that I was driving away from the only person that I wanted to spend Christmas with. And how did you know I would be here? Interestingly enough, Bella told me. Did she? Texted me a picture of the invite actually. Sorry, I know that I'm not technically invited, but, hey, crashin' anyway. Liam, when you tried to tell me how you felt when we were dancing... and probably countless other times... I just... I didn't realize. Same. I think it was always there. We just didn't see it. Well, that's okay. Because now we do. I have some good news. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Most of the people in the town still think we're together, so if you still wanted to come to the party, you could probably attend as my fake boyfriend. Huh. - I could do that. - Mm. Or I could, I don't know, maybe come in as your real boyfriend. I think that could be arranged. - Yeah? - Hm. Merry Christmas, Ash.
