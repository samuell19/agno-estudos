(dramatic intro music) - [Narrator] In 1900, when these films were made along New York's Fifth Avenue, two newly-born inventions were just beginning to shape and expand our lives, the automobile and the motion picture. (celebratory music) We are traveling up turn of the century Broadway, a street already world famous for its swank restaurants, legitimate theaters, and electric lights. The first movie houses were not to be found here, but on the side streets. The Lowly Nickelodeon catered to the common man, and from the beginning, comedy was king. As one showman pointed out, "You can get an onion to make you cry, "but nobody has discovered a vegetable to make you laugh." Films had to be hand-cranked by the weary projectionist. In this early French comedy, someone steals into the Paris Conservatory and makes the great master clock run fast, which speeds up time everywhere in the city. (upbeat quirky music) (upbeat quirky music) (cancan music) (upbeat quirky music) (upbeat quirky music) (upbeat quirky music) (cancan music) (woman screeching) What a difference two decades made. This is Fifth Avenue in the 1920s. The automobile had driven the horse from the street to the racetrack. And this is Broadway and evolution through the roaring '20s as it might've been viewed if we were writing H. G. Wells's "Time Machine." It's 1920, Marion Davies is playing at the Globe. Stage attractions still dominate the Great White Way, like "Cinderella on Broadway" at the Winter Garden. 1921, "Midnight" "Photoplays" and Chalmers underwear. 1923, the cast of the "Ziegfeld Follies" includes Fanny Brice, Bert Wheeler and Paul Whiteman. In 1924, Broadway offers onstage the Marx Brothers, Fred Astaire, and Will Rogers. 1925, on screen Lon Chaney is in the "Phantom of the Opera." In 1926 May West makes headlines when her show is closed and she is sentenced to jail. The moving sign above the Capitol Theater in the distance proclaims, Erich von Stroheim's production, "The Merry Widow" starting Mae Murray and John Gilbert. At the Astor, "The Big Parade" is in its second year. As 1926 ends, "Beau Geste" starting Ronald Coleman is that the Criterion. In 1927, the Criterion features "Old Ironsides" with Wallace Beery and Charles Farrell. Also in 1927 signs for the "Student Prince" and for Cecil de Mille "King of Kings" light up the Broadway sky. 1928, "White Shadows in the South Seas," "Lost in the Arctic" and the contest to find new kids for "Our Gang" comedy. 1929, silent films and the prosperous '20s bow out together. The lights of Broadway take on a special glow before the depression dims them and World War II blacks them out. The sign for the part talkie "Noah's Ark" combines electric bulbs and clouds of steam in a display stretching almost a block. Movie theaters had progressed from shabby Nickelodeon to shining palace. The old hand crank projectionist was only a memory. Through these early movie years Oliver Hardy, first of our four clowns played a part in the growth of silent comedy from rough beginnings to what many today consider a lost art. Here he supports Billy West whose impersonation of Charlie Chaplin was so exact it was uncanny. (upbeat quirky music) The girl is Leatrice Joy. (dramatic music) Enter a sissy, he's Billy Quirk, the film comedy pioneer once leading man to Mary Pickford. (quirky music) (dramatic music) (mellow quirky music) (claps hands) (mellow quirky music) (sizzling quirky music) (tinkly quirky music) (mellow quirky music) (dramatic music) Oliver falls for Leatrice and invites her to the Barbers Ball where trouble develops at once and Billy West proves that when his body is in action it's almost impossible to tell him apart from Charlie Chaplin's little friend. (upbeat quirky music) (feet stomping on the ground) The police arrive, they're looking for a bay rum addict with a mustache. (daunting quirky music) (dramatic music) (feet stomping) (slow quirky music) In "The Hobo," Charlie, I mean, Billy has just collected a big reward. It looks like he's also won the girl from young Oliver Hardy, here minus mustache. (dramatic music) (quirky music) (car door bangs) (engine whirring) (dramatic music) As every movie goer of 1917 expected, the romantic tables are turned so that Billy can give us a typical Charlie Chaplin pathos ending. (mellow music) (sorrowful music) 10 years later in "No Man's Law," an offbeat Hal Roach Western of 1927, Oliver Hardy plays the grubby villain, Sharkey Nye. The girl he's leering at his lovely Barbara Kent. The other prong of this triangle is the girl's guardian stallion, Rex the Wonder Horse. (dramatic music) Running through the woods, Barbara Kent will remind some moviegoers of Hedy Lamarr in "Ecstasy" made a decade after this. But don't be concerned, Barbara is wearing a flesh-colored bathing suit. This is still a family picture. (anticipatory music) (upbeat quirky music) (dramatic music) (leering music) (dramatic music) (horse neighing) (dramatic music) (intense music) (horse neighing) (horse neighing) Barbara orders Rex let Hardy alone, she shouldn't have.

(light upbeat music) (dramatic music) (Rex neighing) (quirky music) (bumbling music) The second of our four clowns is Stan Laurel. Before teaming with Oliver Hardy and perfecting the character of Oliver's beloved, dimwitted friend, Stan often played brash go getters like this patent medicine salesman and bird impersonator. (Laurel chirping) (light tinkly music) (dramatic music) (window bangs shut) (upbeat quirky music) (foot crushing in the door) (upbeat mischievous music) (drum roll music) (upbeat quirky music) (door slams) On a corner nearby, happy Harry, yesterday's playboy in need refreshment.

(upbeat quirky music) It's worse than mice or moths. It's tunneling convict Oliver Hardy, and his burrowing cellmate Stan Laurel.

While he was a very talented fellow from Baltimore, Maryland, he starred in, produced, wrote or directed an amazing 155 films for Hal Roach Studios, most of which were shorts. And he also appeared with many of the top comedy stars of the day, including Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, of course. In the late '30s he directed some of the early "Three Stooges" pictures. But success didn't make Charley Chase very happy, he was always a very heavy drinker and he had an unhappy marriage and that made it a lot worse, and he was just 46 years old when he died of a heart attack. Now I come from Baltimore and he was one of our very big stars. We were very proud of him. He was a very talented man and his name is remembered by movie buffs around the world. Now watch this.
