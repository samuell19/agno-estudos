Here the sea is always looks like a lake. Ours is another matter! - Yes. Oh, I know. I know the sea Baltic, Adriatic. Another Pacific Ocean. - Monsieur traveled all over the world? - Yes. Once I got tired of the ponds and I chose the ocean. Settled on a sailboat. And then I was harpoon whaler ... - Have you seen the whales? “Yes, like you now.” If they allowed me to continue, I would have a car today as wide as a bus! In the meantime, you lick alien cars. Wow ... Accident. But I’ll definitely go back there, to the far north, where in the purple sea White whales live. You saw all this in the movies! Not! I never lie. I even came up with a way how kill whales so they don't suffer! This idea came to my mind there, a night that lasts six months. “Does the night last half a year?” - Yes. Oh, I liked it there so much. It was so beautiful! Then why are you there not left? They did not believe me. A! Wipe your lips too much lipstick. Here they’re not used to it. - Done. - That's better. It's here! You just have to enter that door and turn to the foreman. - And you will not go? - Oh no. Go without me first. If anything goes wrong, I will intervene. “Do you know the owner?” - Not bad. It's me. - You also have megalomania? - If you want, yes. Mania of greatness is my weakness. Who is the foreman? “There is that short brunette.” - Thanks. Hey, be careful! I pull out the cable. Wait, I’m picking up to make it easier to get it. Hold on. Cool! Pack faster. - A bit more... - Do not sleep! - Go help me! - Yes now.

And the owner is me. What is your name? Lina. Handsomely! And me - Henri. Go to the warehouse at the pier. They will give you equipment for work. Hey Henri! All this is nice, but what can we do with it? - We will see. Not often to our home such girls come in. I wonder where is she from? - From the bus. I saw them with Guillaume out of it. “Guillaume is back?” - Yes. Yeah, this one will never stop surprise me! At least once he brought us not a problem. - Hey Guillaume! - A! Already tired of Narbonne? - No cigarettes? - There is. Listen, and your girlfriend well built! Oh, she is not my girlfriend. Will you take her? We will see. I love to know who am I dealing with. “I know her well.” - A? Yes, and her whole family. I know her father, mother, her two younger brothers ... Twins! Her father was a guard ... - What? He guarded the bank safes where i worked. Yes man with principles didn't get along very well with my daughter. Alright alright don't tell me her life. Maybe someday she herself will tell me. So more charm. Damn Guillaume! I’m still glad to see you with your weekly stubble and empty-handed! Guillaume! Guillaume! - Where are you? - I'm here! - Can you give me the pliers? - Where are your pliers here? On that thing. Oh yes. Again the problems with the clunker? Oh, now it will work! Problems with the exhaust pipe only. Wait, I will help you. “Do you understand this?” - Still would! Everything is good? - Yes. Oh you're back and the view is not at all upset. Not. You know last night I quit the bank. How, again ?! I didn't work out with attorneys. Spoiled old man not versed in modern methods. Do you know me. I immediately wished carry out a complete restructuring ... They didn’t believe you? Not. How did you guess? - Have you seen mom? - ABOUT! So we must warn her! Maybe first let's deal with the mechanics? No, that's better! Mother? Mother! - What happened? - Guillaume is back! Guillaume? Oh my God! Again?! Francine! Francine! Oh poor Madame Rosa! Calm down, think about the fit! Oh, I will have it now! Guillaume is back! Ah, my poor, take courage! Strange she never I’m not happy about that. Only at first. Then she will get used to it. A! Here you are! Where is your suitcase? At the club, as usual? What are these leaky pants? And the new costume that I gave to you for christmas? Bet you sold it? Well yes. You see, two suits for work - this is too much. Oh yes, for work. By the way, let's talk about work! We are so hard have attached you to this bank! What happened this time? Tell me! They did not believe me. And my 20 thousand francs? Grandpa, you know what am I... Yes, he knows all too well, poor grandpa, put your savings in your stupid things! He had 3 years do without tobacco. And my 20 thousand francs? I do not drive you out of the house just because I'm your mother! But this time I advise you bring some benefit! If you can! Didn't bring me mine 20 thousand francs - get out! Marinette, follow the wash. And where are you going? I’ll run faster around to did not give loans to your brother. And let me be ashamed! Oh la la! C'mon, don’t worry. The hardest thing is behind. No, yes with her but with the rest ... The rest do not count. And then, I'm here. - Oh you, my Marinettochka! You know, I brought you a present from gar ... from the bank! - Receipt? - No ... Uh ... Wrench. But Guillaume ... Well, mastering a profession? - I probably still have one! “You will learn quickly.” Wait! Not certainly in that way. - But as? “I'll show you.” Take the glove there. - Oh, how ugly. And a hole. - But the hand will protect. So, you see? In small movements. It is necessary to tear mussels. You took a punt for Charlot? Come here! Take it to the warehouse. - What is it? - The end of the working day. - You hurry? - Yes. I need to set a room in Sett. And it's not that simple. “Perhaps there is a way to accommodate you.” Yes? Near the warehouse there is a hut, with beds. We have female workers coming from far away. They spend the night there. Well ... if they are comfortable. - It works for me. Maybe we’ll go to the cinema together in the evening after dinner? Oh no! I'm too tired. The day was so long. Okay, I didn’t say anything. Oh, don't be offended. Let's go another time. Fool, you scared me! Since when mechanics began to cook? You see, it’s on fire! - Forgot to close the valve? Are not you afraid that your ratatouille will smell like gasoline? Well you nuts! I have clean hands. - Show me! - Not. No no! Stop doing that! Marinette! Henri! Aren't you ashamed at your age? Should i follow for her appearance! - My view? - Yes. Better watch the view their new workers. What new female workers? The hiring ended on Tuesday. - I do not know. - Dad! You know you left us bbw anarin. It was necessary to replace it. And as if by chance, you found one whose hands are clean! Probably not really bothered them. This can be understood! This woman is so beautiful! “How do you know, Grandpa?” - She came in. A blouse was pressed in the wind to the body - it was so beautiful! Beautiful in all places. You still have excellent eyesight grandpa. Rose, you did not find in your washing my embroidered shawl? If I found would return to you. Don’t worry, cousin. Your beloved maybe use my handkerchief. “I'm not worried, cousin.” - Not true! “Guillaume is back?” - And you do not hear the device? He set to work. - Yes. He was not left in the bank. What a heavy cross! Here’s what I’ll tell you - be careful. You are not the first one to him like, son of Messardieu. Hey Mussel Pearls is back! Mussel Pearls? Would you be local would know the story, baby. - What story? - Oh, a long story. Anyway, someone this sound amuses, but not me. Many lost money on these devices Guillaume. He is trying to get pearls, miserable coot! Mussel Pearls ... That's how I found out that he actually was the son of Ferro. To those who are nicknamed Mussel pearls. I also wanted to laugh. You talked about the sixth ...? “I'll tell her a lot more!” - I recognize you! One martini! - The bar has a place. - No thanks. I have a few words for Paulette. “Marcel is here?” I'll explain it later, when we will be alone. You can talk with Anutan. This is a friend and a good adviser. - Marcel was arrested yesterday. - Honest mother! We will never be left alone! But this time it was all on the ointment! - How did it happen? - Marcel passed the Greek. - Poor mom! Similar emotions at her age - it will kill her! - Stop playing and don’t worry. We will get your brother out. We must go to Narbonne. And whether the lawyer Molinoro wants do it again? I pulled him out of trouble so that... One good turn deserves another. - We must go the first bus! “I can't go to Narbonne.” - And you too? Yes. - You need to go. - I can’t leave the baby alone! You know Marcel! Don't worry chick Trust me. Until you be gone I'll look after her. And you baby wait for my return. Yes? Yesterday I went to the hostel, you were not there. - I was with friends. - What friends? When you arrived, you did not know anyone. - I met you. “Do you think your father would like that?” “To my father?” My father always wanted so that I get connections. Even in the bar of Antoine? - Yes. There or where else. - Guillaume told me something else. Anyway, it’s better not to go there anymore. - Why? - Because... Antoine is a scoundrel. And he’s going to all port strollers. - So what? “These people are not for you.” How do you know? Hello? Yes, my little one! Good, chick. And you have? Why? Do not despair. Release before trial? Everything is better than nothing. C'mon, you! Do not rush! Yes, sometimes she comes in. Still at the mussel farm. Be calm, I look after her. I, too! See you later! She can't get him out. All the better. - Why? “So she will grumble in Narbonne.” And you and I for now - in complete peace. I will not come again, Antoine. - What is the matter with you? “I don't want anymore, that's all.” Does Messardieu take care of you? That is unlikely. Dad Anutan you still need it. Oh, there is no pearl. Guillaume, and what is a pearl? By Big Illustrated encyclopedias, children, it's a solid pearly round body, formed inside some shells, especially in "meleagrin", which is called in common people pearl jewel. You know that. Only in my opinion ... “Oh, Guillaume, I have something here!” Oh no, this is a piece of shell. - Do you know how to make pearls? - I'm trying. It doesn’t work out yet. - And when will it work? - Christopher Columbus did not immediately discover America! Mussel Pearls ... “Why is it shiny?” - It's mother of pearl! You know, when people eat mussels, they throw them away without looking. But there, you see, - what a beautiful rainbow! Guillaume! - Will you come back? - Yes Yes. “Can you do me a favor?” - Of course. I need 5 thousand francs. “But I haven't!” - Who would doubt that. I would like you to I asked them from a friend of mine. - Okay. Who is he? “Antoine, the owner of the pier bar.” - A! - Yes. Do you really want to? I need this money and only he can lend them to me. I wanted to say you definitely want so that I ask for money? Why should I be shy? - Okay, I went. - Wait! I will wait for you with money at Tivoli pier at 7 o’clock. But since you'll be in Sette why don’t you ask? Because Antoine won't let me go and I have other things to do. You ask too many questions. - Sorry! If he asks you, say that I will come to his house later. - What do you want to pour? - Nothing, I'm without money. “Then why come?” - Well ... I wanted to ask you ... Could you lend me 5 thousand francs? - You're laughing? And who will return them to me? Your mother? From here I can hear her screaming. Yelling, yelling but always returns. I do not like scandals. By the way, the girl from Narbonne, Lina ... Still on a mussel farm? “Still, yes.” You will see her tell me to come in. I have a request for her. - I don’t know if I will see ... - Try hard! Are you promising - I promise. Listen up! - Yes? So 5 thousand francs? Will you give? Oh you... Doing nothing "for it!" You too. What time is he waiting for me? I lent them you don't owe him anything. And ... what are you doing? Why? Did you do it for Henry? Not. For you. Where are you going? I didn’t ask you for anything! Antoine is mine personal bank, okay? It's disgusting. Am I disgusting to you? Who do you take yourself for? You are a loser, insignificance! Everyone laughs at you! I don't want to owe you do you hear You don’t owe me anything. 5 thousand francs Antoine I give you. Give me this one. Convenient these mirrors! You see yourself from head to toe. And you objected to me when I ordered them from Marseille. Or maybe I don’t have to watch on yourself from head to toe? You're wrong. At my age you must have been nice too. And also alone. Instead of admiring yourself I'd rather think of Marinette. Poor thing because of you terribly worried. Why? You are seen too often with a new employee. And what does the baby mechanic have to do with it? If you haven’t figured it out yet, you are a complete fool. - Marinette ?! - Yeah. You're laughing? She is almost like a sister! Or rather, like a brother, so ... - Well, you know, baby, I often saw you glide look over the body of his "brother"! Her corsage, really starts to fill up. It's time! But only a collar on a neck she will not put on me. Let him take Pierrot. He looks at her like a pompous thrush! - Marinette! Aren't you going to dinner? - Not. But you didn’t eat anything at lunch! What happened to you? Nothing. It's all your mania hanging around in the sun without a hat. Here you feel bad! And the appetite is gone! Oh listen you won't force me to feed! No, you heard her Talking to me ?! As if we were little Henry He didn’t come and didn’t even apologize! - Maybe they detained him? - Detained? Not hard to guess, WHO detained him. ABOUT! Taxi! Stopped near us. - At such an hour? Who could it be? - This is Guillaume! - Oh my God! What did he do again ?! I feel approaching disaster! Well no. Let's wait for the news. Hello everybody! - Where are you from? - From Nimes. From Nimes! By taxi! It can't be! - He is joking. “No, I know him.” He is not joking! When Henry is not, he is capable of anything! - Calm down, mom. What did you do in Nimes ?! - I went for garlands for the baptism of Buck. You will not find in Sette, so I went to Him. - By taxi! But also faster than on the train, mom! I'm all so sick, exhausted so you don’t spend extra centime ...! And monsieur! Who assigned you the garlands? - Francine. - Sorry, but I did not send you to Him! Bon appetit, ladies and gentlemen. Who will pay me? And you, why did you carry him? Do not you know this gypsy ?! “Marinette saw me pick him up.” “Yes, but I thought he was going to Sett.” But there were no garlands in Sette, had to go to another place! Okay, round-trip, two dinners and 6 aperitifs, it turns out ... 28 thousand 980 francs exactly. - Exactly ?! And 6 aperitifs! Oh no, I'm sleeping! Well, will you pay? The counter is working. The counter is working ... Oh, Messardieu, give him money! Faster! I can’t get up. I feel, now I will have an attack! 28 thousand francs ... - Here, under the calculation. - Thank you very much and see you soon! - Bye! Do you even understand how much did your garlands cost us ?! - Garlands? No, I didn’t buy them. - Did not buy?! And why? - Dear too. Oh, disappear! Don't get in trouble! And so - 20 years! 20 years I haven’t been sleeping at night, shaking, what else will he think up ?! Go away Go away, said! - Come on, mother ... Nothing! I don't want to shake anymore. He will gradually destroy me! If his father sees us from heaven, he rolls over in a coffin! Calm down, Rose. Better take your pills. Calm down, calm down ... I do not want to calm down! Leave me alone! - Well, what are you, Rose ... Aren't you tired of waiting for him? - Whom? - Henry. Not. He will not come. - You think? - He has another! I know. So that's why you didn’t open her mouth for the whole evening? What do you want? Maybe I have something ... So you never Do not get tired of waiting for him? When you want something your best you will definitely achieve. You just have to pay. Any price! Oh stop it come on we want to sleep! Voila! I thought you were with Henry? - Yes. We went to the movies. A! What did you watch? Very sad movie. I cried like that! This is a story about a billionaire, which is not allowed to marry a loved one. And then, for his sake, she gives up everything. But he is the last bastard. She got everything from him in every way. How did he mock over the poor thing! Yes, that happens sometimes. Listen, do you want a peach? Where did you get him? I did not steal it. I brought it to you from Nimes. How beautiful! What is it? This is a mother of pearl powder. To make it a gem you need to put a little inside the oyster, it hurts them and they produce a pearl. - You are bulling me? - Not. It is very easy to understand. Here we have, when we have a wound, then the blood is flowing. And they make pearls. And to achieve this, are you so noisy with these motors Yes. Oysters only I’m not very lucky so I try with mussels. - Pearls! Real pearls! “I studied this question for a long time, you know.” And then I decided and invented all these machines. Yes, I invented them. And I'm sure what I can do! Believe me. Well hopefully when you succeed you will give me a necklace. Beautiful necklace. I promise! “And you believed him?” - Why not? Unlucky talker! At first, everyone believed him. But not me. And my father bought himself. Of course, I disturbed him. But his mother and even cousin Francine, despite to their stinginess, - everyone invested. And even some farm workers lent him his savings. 17. It lasted 2 years but, in the end, everyone understood. - Pearls from Mussels! - Funny, is not it? Pretty nickname from which everyone laughs. But let's not talk about him. Talk about you. - About me? About us. Why when I say I love you do you always have an unbelieving look? Because you said it many to me. Yes. But this time is the truth. You and I are meeting kiss and ... And if I'm not like that, what do you think? You are not like the others. That's it! That's why I like you. What happened to you? “Well, Lina, is everything all right?” Can I tell her a few words? You are welcome. It means, with your permission, a few words in private! But not to long. We have a lot of work. - Henri! - Lina! - Marcel was released! - Marcel ?! He is waiting for you in Narbonne. Well well! And is that all your joy? But ... why did you decide I'm not happy?

Interestingly, Marcel will think, when he sees you with sunburn on your face? There is something to attract customers! - Customers? - Yes, customers! Her customers! Since she didn’t have the courage to tell you I must tell you myself! You never heard of lina from Mush Quarter to Narbonne? Anyone can get it just pay. Why do you want to leave? There is no reason.

Well, throwing old friends? Since you don’t come to us, we ourselves have come this way. Get away from her! She doesn't want to know you anymore! I'm sorry, but I'm talking with mademoiselle! - Marcel, please do not attract attention. - You're right. And then the rest are so educated! We do not need a scandal. - Then get out! I politely speak with you no rudeness! Marcel, be quiet! People around! I am well brought up but I won’t allow myself to be fooled! Lina wants to start a new life - this is her business. Not every day seems such a case. But how am I ?! When I picked her up she had nothing to change. That I sheltered, fed dressed, brought up. Can you imagine how much this is? at current prices? Uncle!

Uncle! Jojo, shut up! No need to annoy uncle! Son! Uncle says about serious things! Take Lina if you want. But I want to get compensation. 100 thousand francs. Scoundrel! - Listen, I will not tolerate ...! - Marcel! Blessing! My sister is right - this is not the place to cling to us like movers! However ... think about it! Where will you find so much money? If you think that I will give at least we give to this bastard ... 100 thousand francs? 100 thousand blows in the face - yes! - Hold on, gentlemen. - Thanks! Thanks. Where have you been? I’ve been waiting for you for 2 hours. I will not allow this! Caution! Watch out, Henry. He has a peaceful look, but you you don’t know what he is capable of! I tell you, I'm not afraid of him! And I'm afraid. He doesn't often punish but if it starts ... can say he gets pleasure from it. I do not like, when you say so. Lea, I tell you about her told. The girl he was with to me. so accepted, you know. - 100 000?! Wow requests! And why? - He did not want to tell me. - And you, of course, did not insist! I thought he would come to you. to explain. I hope we are not going to give them to him? I dont know. Poor baby. When he came ask them, he had such a face ... such a look ... Oh but speech not about life or death! And will you succumb to this comedy ?! When you gave 300 thousand francs to Guillaume on his story with pearls, did you also think it was a comedy? - I gave a story with a pearl, not sexual intercourse! - Shh! Marinette! Okay, I get it. I have gone. - Good afternoon! - Hello. - Hi, Pierrot! - Hello, Marinette. Do you know why Henry need 100 thousand francs? “So he will pay?” - Pay for what? Why then was portraying a dodger and swear that he won’t give a penny? - Not a penny to whom? - I do not know... Oh listen, just started go on! I said, I don’t know anything. Nothing at all! If you want to know more contact Lina. To Lina? Okay, I'm going. No, Marinette! - What are you up to? - I said nothing. You didn’t say anything, but you arranged so she knows everything. So what? I find it stupid that she is going through because of the type who wanted to spit on her. This money that asks Henry this is for you? Do not want to answer? - Not. Why? Because it's my business not yours. If it's not something obscene, you would have no reason to be silent. I am silent because of you it does not concern. That's all. Why are you here? Because of you, everything is awry! Until you come here, Henry was happy! Henry is already big, he can take care of your happiness. Don't worry about him nor about his money. 100 thousand francs! For people earning by my work, it’s a lot! It's about you you can’t understand. I can’t understand and do you know? - Not. “So you know?” Nobody told me anything. Then where are you going? Believe me. "Believe me"! Only you know how to say it! You make me and mom a laughing stock! With your pearls, with your mussels, your laziness! Nobody will believe you anymore! No one! Here you go! He was given half a million! As I think - my temperature rises! And it is still unknown what will he do with it! He himself knows. No one could argue with him! Henry for 4 years did not get his interest. Messardier refused to give me 200 francs for the purchase of tickets for the national lottery. So they need it! C'mon, Grandpa, Messardieu always They gave you stamps for your collection. Nothing, I'm not offended. When I had to return the money to the workers because of the stupid things of Guillaume, they are us too all ears buzzed. Now it's their turn! Guillaume! Yes? - Listen, Guillaume ... - What's the matter? - Are you mad at me? - No, I'm not angry. And why be angry with you? - You know, this is not true. - What? “What I told you.” - A! What did you say... I believe you. I always believed you. Just stupid people laughing at those who is not like them. Not like them ... This does not mean that it is better. And for me it’s better! One day you will do something which will shock everyone. Except me. And me. People say you are a loser. But this is not true. Just you follow for your fantasies. Yes I know. But it pisses me off what mussels think like them! This is so upsetting! Why don’t they make pearls ?! What persistence? But somehow I did it. Very beautiful pearls. - Oh, listen, Guillaume, they were with a pinhead, they were almost invisible! Yes, but how shiny! What if instead of mother of pearl to try almond oil? - Oh, you know, I ... - No ideas? But funny! They say that the inventor no one is needed that he is always alone with his passion. But this is not true! For me, everything is completely wrong! I believe that we are much stronger if there is one next to us ... - Who believes in us? - Yes. A! Here! This time you said it! Hey rosetta be careful when you pick up the basket. Why so? Bend down, the wind will blow and show us the whole landscape! - It's not for you! - And for whom? - Hey, Francois! - What? You work here or doing bullshit? Not everyone has 100 thousand francs, to do bullshit! - Repeat! - Leave me alone! Repeat, I want to laugh too! What? I'm not afraid to say what your beautiful eyes all the girls are yours! Only no one has paid yet in a brothel so expensive! Stop it! Stop! Stop, are you crazy ?! Leave me alone! Henri! - What have you done! - I shut his mouth! You didn't deserve it Mr. Messardieu. My son, too, Mr. Commissioner. In such cases, I have seen many ready to do the same as him. Only they didn’t, Mr. Messardier. Just like you. You lived so that you won respect for the entire neighborhood. And that is the difference. You know who this girl is for which you committed the murder? Yes. Then you have to imagine what will she bring you to. - She is not guilty. - She is an adult. Her dossier proves this. - Her file? Yes. She is 4 years old registered with the morale police. We have a file on her. This is not news for you, is not it? Not. Having escaped from the colony for minors, she found a waitress place in one of the bars of Marseille. There she met with a certain Marcel Angelatti, a pimp who attached it to the sidewalk. Still nothing new for you? Then she was implicated in the "Case of the Company", She has two criminal records for theft. Did you know that too? As I see, your information not as complete as you thought. Henri ... "Don't leave me, Henry! Never Throw Again. " "If you leave me now, you don’t even can you imagine what will happen to me. " "You don't know how low I can fall. - Not! No, I'll never leave you! " Mademoiselle Lina in the dating room. I asked 100 times to tell her I don’t want to see her. Let it leave me alone! I'm sorry, but I do not believe. Unfortunately, with our poor knowledge we do not believe in the possibility of success. You see, it was always important to me succeed where others have failed. Noble ambitions! Only usually I fail what the others do. They say "there is no prophet in his own country." Well listen, really sorry because i was hoping what you as engineers besides the Japanese ... - We also have mussels. “But you have no pearls.” You eat them. - Yes, yes, for sure! Guillaume! - Will you allow it? - You are welcome. “Well, did it work?” - Oh, what are you! These Japanese are generally little to understand. - Just do not be discouraged. - Never! As soon as they go outside, I will forget about them. You don't take them to Sett? - What for? “You can't let them go like that!” Maybe they have any thoughts? - You think? - Try to put pressure on the ride. “Maybe you're right.” - Listen, since you're going to Sett, maybe you go to Lina? - To Lina? I don’t even know where she lives. At the hotel at Kontfors Street, 14. Why do you need so I see Lina? To give her money. But with one condition: Let it go far anywhere and right away! Do not be shy! You didn’t notice that Messardier is bigger doesn't go to Sett, out of fear of meeting her? Are you sure. What exactly is it because of him do you want her to leave? She must disappear. She has done so much evil. Come in! Good evening! Oh, such a surprise! Come in. Fell yourself like at your own home. Got a cigarette? Thanks. I was too lazy to go after them. How nice! How is everything all right? Yes almost. Is the family okay? Mother? Younger sister? By the way, it is she ... me... She sent me to ... Looks like it not so easy to say? Oh no. Oh yes! She thinks you now constrained by means and because of this you can’t get back to your Narbonne. So she asked me ... take you some money to relieve... - What kind heart she has! - Oh yeah. Already leaving? Will you come to visit me again? Why not? Before you leave? My departure? What kind of departure? - How? Aren't you leaving? “Oh yes, of course!” At the end of the week. Or a month. Or at the end of the year. Here is how! - Do you want a drink? - Not. And I want. Take me a drink somewhere. Yes, I’m happy, only ... I treat you! - Here is how? “I'll just wear a dress.” - I'm waiting for you outside. - Why? You do not know, How is a woman? No, but there is Henry. Henri? Woo! He is no more. And I am a whore. I would like to know why are you spying on me. And you still ask? Oh yes, this is your habit. You always spy on everyone. Not for everyone! Then why follow me? To stop you cum like henry! A! That's the problem! - Yes, that’s what I will not give you break your life. And what's in it, in this slut, why are you all running after her like little dogs ?! Looks like you hate her because everyone loves her? Are you pleased that they love her? You like to wait for her while love her? I think no one ever really didn’t love her. Fool! Admit that you just want to sleep with her! - Yes. Yes it's true. But not only that. In any case, you do not understand. Of course! Where to me! You again? I told you, do not come at this time! - I need to talk to you. “Then come back later.” - Well, listen ... - Wait a minute. Look what I brought you. Remember, you asked me? See, I have not forgotten! - Did you finally succeed? - Not. Bought from a jeweler. So reliable, you know? - He's artificial! - Naturally. You only know ... the glass is covered with a film, which is called moonlight. Moonlight? Yes, it is made of flowers, revealing only at night. - Oh, what are you talking about again! “You don't want him?” Lets go faster! Lina, you know this cannot go on. But you knew who I was. What are you complaining about? Lina! Guillaume! Guillaume ... What's wrong with you? “I want you to be only mine.” - Fool! When they want a woman to be only him, marry her! No, I definitely can’t, it hurts me too much! Finish instead of me. A little bit more, and I will end up in a cemetery. But how calmly I will be there! Stop whistling! You are in this state because that Guillaume is packing his things? You usually prefer so that he is far away. Unfortunately, he is not far away. And very close! But this woman is good about him cares. He is happy. What did you say?! Since they are together He has changed a lot. He works, she has a beneficial effect on him. I hope you didn’t go to them? I went. - You are pleased! - I? You. I'm glad your brother hit the paws of Lina. Because so you imagine what can you get Henri! - Yes. - Nothing else counts! Nothing! The term was reduced to me, in a year it’s over. Henri! Are you still thinking about Lina? What a strange question. Are you afraid that I will I take her? No, that’s not the point. You know, we are with her see you again. - A! - Yes. AND...? Uh ... yes. Naturally. Look where I am. Doesn't that say anything to you? We live in a hotel. “And what do you live on?” - I now work on a mussel farm. This was what Lina wanted. Your father is very pleased with me. I think it all adds up ... All is well. “Why are you telling me all this?” It was she who asked me. I think we will get married. Getting married? Here is the Pearl of the Mussels! It was easy for her to turn you around. Well, this story does not concern me! You are already an adult, you yourself know what you are doing. I wish you happiness! Oh, happiness! You know me ... If only she were happy! He goes to her every night. after work. And walk with her arm in full view of the whole city! - What would you like? She is his wife. - Oh, his wife ... His wife! Wife for everyone! “I would like her to be mine!” - What are you, grandpa! “Francine, say yes, don't talk!” And we never decided about Guillaume. What is there to decide? No one will let him settle here with this creature! While I'm alive Lina will not cross the threshold of this house! Only over my dead body. If you do not accept it, doesn't she exist? She thought of him! Wants come back here and piss us off. This is definitely not Guillaume invented. 20 years he was reproached for that he does not know what he wants. Now he knows! Its share is 5 million. You're still lucky that your Henry is in prison! Not under your roof this Lina will live! But when Uncle Arissi married the girl, which I picked up at the port, i was little but i I remember your reaction well. And now you are all kind to her. Even you. Listen, you have no right shut the door in front of my brother. Let this slut bring her here. I will not talk to her! I won’t even see her! I'll lock myself in my room and they will only carry me forward with my feet! They all gathered at the train station, waiting for me. Will search on my face jail marks and what they call shame. My father, Marinette, they will all be there together, in one fit, with the right to continue blame me. Even her. Even Guillaume. “Nothing has changed here.” - Perhaps! “What did Grandpa Thiero die from?” - From grief. After Guillaume's Wedding he looked like a shadow. No, Frasina, he died at 88. It's enough! And then, he had indigestion. - Thanks. - And he loved Lina very much. He hated her. Even the rose begins pay tribute to her. And no offense if she helps her. Thank you soon Guillaume why did he bring her here ?! He doesn't need so much, cousin. But by doing so, he proved that he is a man. The man! You think it's just - to marry such a lina? And Henry has not changed, huh? No, he has not changed. Perhaps a little thin. Maybe. I have not noticed. I hope he won’t be offended that I replaced him on a farm in his absence. Why? You are the same boss like him. Not too long ago, having said this, you would make people laugh. - Guillaume! - Yes? There is one thing about which I would like to ask you. This is your story about pearl mussels ... did you really believe that? Well ... I believed for quite some time, and then... And then I pretended. But if you're into it anymore did not believe why did you keep locking with your cars? Because I was lonely I was sad... So Pierrot, these baskets can be removed. Today we don’t need them, they do not belong here. It was Guillaume who told them to endure. Ah, here is how? Okay, then I am silent. He believes that if you take them out in the evening, it saves time. This is his idea. Ah, so he has ideas? Wow! He now seems big boss? Ever since he got married he succeeds, no? - Pierrot, the car broke down again. “Why don’t you fix it?” - In my dress? “You're going to order a new one.” And cousin Francine? Goes to the tailor too? You forgot that on the first Friday months I go to confession? Tell me, Henry, maybe you can take us. in your car? Who will refuse such a beautiful girl? What are you saying? Wait, you will spin me! And you break my hair. You know, you have changed so much! Manners, hairstyle - you're different. You have become a young woman. I was already her before you left. Did not you notice? Not like today. That's not for long. With you, it’s possible. But with Francine ... She needs to pray so much ... - How stupid you are! I am waiting for you. I’ll smoke it for now. - We only have 2 dresses to try on. - 2 dresses and coats! “Is that all?” - 2 summer dresses. This is in this magazine you chose your wedding dress? What do you need? “Why are you avoiding me from my return?” “I am not avoiding you.” “But we have something to say to each other!” - I do not think so. Are you ... are you happy with Guillaume? Since when are you interested in my happiness ?! I want to know, do you love him Do you like Answer me! What is the difference now ?! Lina! I need to see you. “You see me every day.” Not so see. Alone! It can't be between us it was all over! You yourself wanted this! I'll never get used to the thought that you belong to another! Why did you get married for Guillaume? I married him because he invited me to become his wife! Is that enough for you? Imagine this idea he first came to mind. “That's what you wanted!” - Not. Not with you. I haven’t asked so much. And you think that I will leave you to him without trying ... I know you well enough to understand that you will try to ruin everything again. Lina! I wanted to forget you there. I could not. I thought of you day and night ... And you? And I think about my husband. I am a good wife! Well, are you going? We have been waiting for him for more than an hour. “Maybe something happened to him?” Nothing happened to him. He's just laughing at you. With this fog I'll pick it up pneumonia! Let's wait a little longer. His car is still here. You are upset in vain. You cannot force a person to love yourself. But I don’t care. I love him. And if a loved one Doesn't love you? Gotta have pride hide it. You see! This must be stated! Is this Guillaume? “I forbid you to say that it’s Guillaume!” Do you hear You have no right! My poor Francine! Okay, let's go home. Listen Pierrot Any news from Henri? No, no. I think he left in Him or in Narbonne. But as far as I know him he will call me soon. Already 4 days from him, neither hearing nor spirit. I am starting to worry. His car is still in the same place outside. The windshield is full of fines. And the keys, for sure, stayed with him. What's the matter? What you need? - I'm after him. - A! Spare me from him! Oh, New Earth! There will be no bottle of rum for an old friend? Let's go. Get up - Are you glad? There will be something to tell. Blazer! Hey! He’s been here for 3 days, and paid nothing! Do not get tired, I was already looking. 2 thousand? Didn't you screw up? Don’t you stay? At last! - Good evening. - Good evening! - I am thirsty. - The refrigerator has cold water. I do not want water. Do not drink! You never killed anyone. I should know. - You act like a child! - Well no! Not. No, I'm acting like a man! I spent 3 days with a whore. It remains only to marry her. - What are you talking about? You so admire those who picks up wives on the panel. Ah, here it is! What do I admire? By doing what they want and when they want. Then why don't they give us bring your favorite here? I obeyed you. If you really loved her I didn’t have to obey me. You're not mad at me but for yourself. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Do you hear? One! - Lina. Yes? Why do not you Love Me? I never promised love you. Do you still love Henri? If this is what bothers you, you can be calm. He will never get me. I’m not asking you this. Be content with what can i give you. Not very happy, eh? Not. I am not very happy. Is the length suitable? What do you think? I do not see. Only Henry has a big mirror and he doesn’t want to be bothered. “What is the matter with him?” - Ah, he smokes, smokes. The house stank of this smoke. And he answers any questions with rudeness. Okay, I'm going to him. You weren’t at work today? When a company has many bosses, nothing works. So I'm resting. “Aren't you sick?” I've had enough! Got it, got it! That's what is happening to me! I want me to left alone! What happened to you? You cry? I used to cry because you did not love me. Now i'm crying because you are unhappy. Are you crazy? Unhappy! I just have a bad mood. What thoughts have brought you in such a state! Are you sad because of me? From the age of 5 I hide when I cry and everyone thinks I have no heart. Poor mechanic! Hey, it's over. Smile to show that you are not angry with me. Marinette! I'm coming! Are you coming to dinner tonight? You know, if I come, it’s only because of you. See you! Already come? And Guillaume went to the warehouse. I saw him. And ... he will be back soon. Let not be in a hurry. - Let me go! “I've been waiting for you too long!” Lina! Who are you talking to there? With Henry. I want you! I can’t lose you. You loved me too! Yes. So do I. So why? Never! You made your choice, Henry. Nothing to return. - Lina! You are early, my boy! - Pour you a glass? - Yes please. Wow, I can't take it anymore! A whole hour at the stove! Lyonochka, bring bread. Ah, good that I have it! And then Marinette is now just spinning in front of the mirror. - The very age! She wants to please the boys. - And it turns out for me. Pierrot invited me to dance on Saturday night. I hope you agreed? But no. I refused. Henri, and you never me did not invite to dancing. “You know, I don’t know how to dance.” - I'll teach you! You see it's so simple under the phonograph. Thanks. - See how simple it is? “Yes, simple.” And nice. - With me? “Especially with you.” Henri! Do you even love me a little bit? - Naturally! Oh I know that no girls should asking the boys about it. But I need to know. You know, I’d have enough and very little. Ah, you are my mechanic! Kiss Me. They’ve been dancing for half an hour! Yes I see. So what? “And how long will you endure this?” “But that doesn't concern me!” And then, they do nothing wrong. - Do not do? Can't you see how Henry behaves? Oh no, you don’t see. You don’t see anything at all. Sometimes I ask myself Do you even see me? You only know that you are silent and look a look that makes you feel guilty! - Well, the music is over. - Yes. - Good night. - Good dreams. Are you proud of yourself? What are you doing in my room? Wouldn’t be such a fool I would understand that you are wasting your time! - Looking at you, I would say the opposite. - No, he breaks the comedy! - How do you know? - He's cheating on you. He doesn't think of you for a second. He only wants me to be jealous! - As I see, he succeeds. - Why are you persisting? He is just a doll, a rag! How can you love him? And you? Be calm, I see him like this what he really is. I know that he is you still loves. But also despises. I will wait as long as necessary. I am patient. “You will never wait.” - Why? I am only 18 years old and I am not a whore! See, you still love him. What's happening? Nothing. Nothing happens. - When will you remake this barn? - Next month. Move this wall away. Pierrot! Give Antoine two donkeys. What gender He is our good customer. Do you know Guillaume? - Yes. We saw each other once upon a time. “Did you know Lina too once?” - You see ... - No, you're wrong! He is not familiar with my wife. He does not know Madame Ferro. Is not it, Antoine? This is true. I don’t know her. Whom do you hope to deceive? We do not change the skin, changing surname. Your wife is just Lina. When will you already understand? - She's right - people do not change. - Oh no, she's not right! People change! Here you are before was not a scoundrel! Anyway, she wants me. She told me herself. True? Yes it's true. Even if true didn't have to say that, Lina. Would you rather live in a lie? You can lie with words, Guillaume, you can lie without saying anything. You know this method very well. Now you have to tell the truth. Say something. Something true. Go away! Leave both. Guillaume! Pushing his wife into the arms of Henry did you think what would happen to me Aren't you tired of suffering? But to suffer next to your loved one - this is bullshit. You will see what it means to suffer alone. You will see! You don't ask where did i come from Not. I have not been with Henry. What's the difference! I told you never I will not belong to him. Never! You also told me be content with what I have. But this is not enough for me. - I don `t want to leave! “You are leaving.” “Are you persecuting me?” - Yes, love. “You are afraid of what might happen.” So you want to get rid of me! - Nothing can happen. They are all right in saying that you are just a loser! You're not even capable hold on to your wife! Listen. Listen to me carefully. I am capable of anything. I am able to fight against the whole world! But what can I do, when does truth stand in front of me? What is the truth? That you don't love me Guillaume! Like this. Once you told me: "Because I was lonely and sad!" No exaggeration. You should not feel sorry for me. Sometimes when we search we are very happy. There are even times when you’re starting to think that you’re about to find it. No, I lived my life looking for pearls that are not there. You cry! I had a whaling mussel pearls and you. And I had poverty nasty things and then ... you. - And he. - Who is he"? Lina! I was mad at you, Guillaume! You took it all, not a word without saying, hands down. I could not understand Do you love me for who I am. What should I tell him, Guillaume? Say you're bigger than him do not love. Only... He still loves you. “No, he never loved me.” Любить меня - это ещё и любить ту Лину. He failed ... And you? I? Oh i think i love you from that night in the garage remember when you walked in so self-confident? I swaggered. We were both so poor! And now? Believe me! He didn’t even notice me. He may have me never noticed. He will never love me. Henry ... END
