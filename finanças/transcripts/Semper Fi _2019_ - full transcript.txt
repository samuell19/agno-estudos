Yeah. Woo! Oh, fuck, man. Jesus Christ. - Sorry. - Fucking idiot. Hey, hey, hey. I thought I told you guys to settle down? We'll settle down when you cut your hair. That seems like a fair deal to me. Don't make me call the cops, smart ass, all right? Hey, when's the last time you oiled these lanes, bud? Yeah, homie. They're gripping like crazy so we can't shoot well. Tony, will you dance with me? I think we got off on a wrong foot - and I'd love to... - Get the fuck off me. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get the fuck off of me. Whoa. Look, if you rednecks don't like the way I run this place, you can get the fuck out. Finally, I'm a redneck. Fuck, yeah. Congrats. I'm calling the cops. Fuck off. Hey. Hey. Come on.

Five minutes, McKowski. Hi. Hi. - Fucking sick. - Fuck. Are you wearing cologne? Fuck yourself. Can you smell it all the way up there? Yeah. Fuck yeah. I can smell it. I thought we were fucking going by a candle shop or some shit. I'm right next to him. I feel like I'm gonna pass out. Fucking smells like glitter. It's part of my fucking morning ritual, okay? What is your morning ritual? Walk us through that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I get up in whose ever house I'm in, get home, usually. Crawl out a window. - Crawl out a window. - Crawl out a window. Put on my crisp white strips. - For about half an hour. - Fuck you. You got to let those things set in, you know. Then I do the hair. That's a good... That's a good 15 minutes in itself. Yeah, it's got a good coiff to it. And then, uh... Yeah. Just as I'm going out the door maybe a little spray and walk into it. Walk out of the door, you know. What, uh... What's your cologne called? What's it called? It's called Transcendence. No! No, Cal. Please don't make us do a squat thrust, man. Come on. It's one weekend a month. You can do this. Fuck. Has anybody seen my cover? Oh, come on. Fuck. Fuck. No, I think I left it back at the... God damn it. Where's your cover, marine? Fuck me. Hold on. Staff Sergeant Callahan, a word. Staff Sergeant, what's up with your Devil Dog? - Sorry, sir. - Aren't you two related? Half-brother. When are you gonna get your shit together? No. When are you gonna stop sleeping with men for money? - Hey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you don't have a cover now. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on? He took my cover. Well, he started it. Ask him. Come on. Sorry. Give me 20 on the obstacle course. - All right, Staff Sergeant. - Come here. The fuck is wrong with you? Man, he's just always on my shit. - He's jumping in my face. - What the fuck? You can't drill without a cover. Yeah. I know. I had my cover laid out for me... - Go field day the head. - ...and I just spaced... What? No. Come on. Let me do the obstacle course, Cal. - Staff Sergeant. - Staff Sergeant, - let me do the obstacle course. - Now. All right, gents. We're going white light. Real world. We're in condition one. Hammered pairs, single brain. Single brain. - Give me one. - Yeah! Brace, brace front! Close door right! Clear. Moving! Brace, brace front. Move! All clear! Clear! - Room all clear. - Callahan, dig your fucking corners! The lazy way is the dead way. And Yoo-hoo, you're finger fucking your safety. Get the gun in the fight. Mama and Papa were laying in bed. Mama and Papa were laying in bed. Papa rolled over and this is what he said. Papa rolled over and this is what he said. - I want some. - I want some. - I need some. - I need some. - Get some. - Get some. - Get some. - Get some. - Grease some. - Grease some. I've heard some grumbling, not enough gear, how they're calling up a bunch of old reservists. I know, uh, some of you got full-time jobs you don't wanna leave. I think we got, what? Two, is it, that are expecting? But, uh, at some point, we all signed on the dotted line. You took an oath to serve your country in its time of need, and now's that time. We clear? Yes. Back in the fight. What? Just wish you'd look out for me. Really? Didn't I just get you a job at the diner? Just feels like whenever it's between me or someone else, you side with the other guy. What do you expect, man? You know, I petitioned the Marine Corps to forgive your felonies. What do you do? You get in a fight the second we got out there. I'm starving. Yeah. Well, there's lasagna. That lasagna is still in here. I made this, like, two weeks ago. It's disgusting. You know I got that job at the diner 'cause I'm good, right? I'm good at cooking. And the Marines need people right now. It's not like some felony waiver is a big favor to me, man. You always got a smart-ass response, don't you? Yeah. Brains is my burden, homie. Yeah, well, you got one more offense, you're going back in. You know that, right? Soy comprehende. You know, you're really starting to piss me off. Can I remind you of what you were like at my age? Oh, I got my shit together though, didn't I? At least I finished high school in four years. I actually read books. You read, like, magazines like Guns & Ammo. - Don't worry. I'm moving out. - Mm-hmm. I'm serious. I got a business plan for a fleet of food trucks. I'm gonna make a mil by the time I'm 30. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What do you know about running a business? Lots. There's this book called The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People, and it teaches all the secrets of success. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What are they? I haven't read the book yet but when I get into... You haven't read the book. I just got the book. How am I supposed to read it... - I'm sorry. - ...when I just bought it. - I'm sorry. That wasn't cool. - No. It's not funny. - The fuck are you laughing at? - Hey, come here. Don't... I'm not gonna fucking tell you. - Don't do that, all right? - Fuck off. I just wanna know about the habits... Get the fuck off me! What? Fuck. You're fucking deranged, man! Teddy. Hey. You all right? What happened? - You okay? - Go away. - Let me take a look. - Go away. I think the chicken's done. So, uh, what... How do you guys... You guys know Jaeger? You just, uh... - Oh, he just came up to us. - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. He does that. - Thank you. - Water, vodka, vodka. Thank you, sir. - So you really don't drink? - Uh, I used to. He'll have a drink with a side of communion wafers. What do you do for fun? I mean, I'm having fun right now. Are you? - Yeah. - Obviously. Oh! - There he is. - What up, Snowball? - What's up, baby? - And Milk. - Hi. - Bro. - Can I get a beer, please? - Yeah. Here's your beer. Bam. CO, sidebar. Clara's in the AO, can I tag out? All right. Will you cover me while I move? Yeah. Ladies, have you seen his tats? - Whoa. - No. Let's see them. - Check them out. - Wow. That is sexy. - Thanks. - What does it mean? I got them a while back. Yo, yo, yo. Come. Come with me. With me. - It's your lucky day. - Oh, really? Show me. Show me. Ladies, look who I just bumped into. Everybody, this is Snowball. - Hi, ladies. - Uh, and this Oyster. These guys happen to be related. - No. Where are you going? - Uh, that's Val. Hello, ma'am. I'm Oyster. - And this is Carrie. - Hello. Carrie is an English major. I speak English. That's great. You're coming back, right? Nice meeting you. - Amazing. - Yeah, I've been doing it wrong. - Seven to 11. - Oh, hi. - Oh, hi. Good to see you. - You too. - How are you? - Great. Great. - Hey, Clara. - Hi, Cal. How are you? You gonna buy a round of those for your two favorite servicemen? - Maybe next round. - Mm. What you, uh, doing in town? - My mother's 60th. - Oh, nice. When are you guys shipping out? Uh, any day. Wow. I can't believe they're actually sending in reservists. Yeah, you know, if you were going off to war, I would definitely... I would do the patriotic thing. You know, I'd buy you a drink. I'd invite you back to my place. Can my boyfriend come? I mean, I guess he could hold the camera. Only you would use this bullshit war as an excuse to get laid. Only you. - Usually works. - Not tonight. - Do you wanna get out of here? - No. You sure? I don't how we ever broke up. You're so charming. Ah, well, there was a time when it wasn't beneath you to date a guy who didn't have a masters. Time to go. Have fun tonight. It went well. Just got a text from the ball and chain. What's he say? "Look, don't get so drunk you can't fuck me later." Oh. You know, um, in World War II they invented wife swapping, because, you know, the life spans were so short. So I'm here for you, bro. Rachel would never fuck a Mexican. That's literally not what every mariachi in town says. Yo, can I get ten bucks, because I really wanna buy these lovely ladies a few alcoholic beverages, and I have had a few more than they have had. Go panhandle somewhere else. All right. I'm out of here. I'm spent. You, easy on the booze, and don't make a fucking - racket later, okay? - Oh, will you get a wife? Then you can boss your wife around, so you don't have to boss me around. You get your own another place, do whatever the fuck you want. All right, Staff Sergeant. All right, Staff Sergeant. - All right. All right. - Staff Sergeant. - Mailbox. - We're racing. - No, I'm gonna stick around. - Are we running? - Oh, yeah. - Stay gold, pony boy. Last time we only went to Milk's and I gave up. - What up, Dwyer? - What's up, dude? DJ, hey, can I get $10 because I got these beautiful honeys back there, and I wanna buy them some drinks. - I'm a little low on cash. - Oh, yeah, man. - Yeah. - That's a good friend. - There you go. - Thank you. But you better hurry up before Daley gets all of that shit, huh? Always Ben fucking Daley. I'm gonna kill this kid. Really? I'm not letting you win this time, Milk. - Shit. - Hey. Thanks, Captain Planet. All right. I got to fucking beat you, man. Get ready to be smoked. - Mark. - Set. Go. You're going down, Milky. Where are the prettiest girls at the bar doing with a couple of scoobs? What... What's a scoob? Just please leave. Bye-bye. Fuck off, Oyster. Sorry. - Yikes. - What's a scoob? I don't know. Just kind of came to me. Come on, man. Fuck. Get the fuck off me. Get the fuck off me. Ben? Yo? Ben! - Ben. - Yo? Get up. Ben? Stop. Get down. Callahan. What? Get back. Thank you. Tell me. He slammed Ben Daley's head into a urinal. - Your brother's record... - Yeah, I know. - And fleeing the scene... - I'll find him, all right? Just let me find him first. Oyster! - Baker Six to headquarters. - Go ahead, Baker Six. Yeah, I got that Bronco at 35 Riverside Drive. Copy that. Teddy, get out here. Hear me out, all right? - I'm listening. Yeah. - All right. - There were two of them. - Uh-huh. They fucking jumped him, all right? - That's great. - It was self-defense, brother. He can explain at the fucking station. You're gonna fucking arresting him? What do you think I gotta do? I gotta fucking take him in. You're not gonna fucking take him to the station. - Talk to him. - He explain it - at the fucking station. - You think - they're gonna believe him, Cal? - What's that? What the fuck is that? Huh? What's he gonna do, jump the border? What are you... What the fuck are you doing getting involved? Why are you behaving like a fucking cop? - I am a fucking cop. - He's your fucking brother. Sit down, all right? Just sit down and stay out of it, please. Teddy, get out here. He's got your fucking passport, bro, come out here. - Sit the fuck. - Yeah, I fucking heard you. All right? - What are you thinking? - Give it to me. All right. Easy. Easy, guys. - Don't fucking... No, no, no. - What the fuck are you thinking? - Hey. Hey. - You can't run from this shit. - Easy. Easy. - All right? What do you think's gonna fucking happen? - Look, Oyster! - Fuck. Fuck. Motherfucker. Get the fuck off me! No, no, no. Cal. You stupid motherfucker! I told you they're gonna fucking take me to jail. You fucking loser! You fucking fuck! - You stupid motherfucker! - Hey. You know they're gonna put me in there! - Take it easy. - You fucking piece of shit. All right? Come on. Calm down. Ben Daley just passed away. No, no, no. Oh, God. No. Fuck. No. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - No, no, no. - That's my brother. No, no, no! No, no! Get your hands off me! No! Get your fucking hands off me! No! No! Look at me. Look at me. Fuck! You stupid fucking animal! Good. I just wanna point out real quick that we're pulling fucking security for porta potties, man. Are you aware of that? Get the fuck back up there. - Go, go, go. - Up, up. More, more, more. - More, more, more. - Level with the window. Snowball, put some dick skin on it, bro. Working on it. Fuck. Fucking piece of shit. Couldn't they give us real fucking shovels? I've had fucking hard-ons bigger than this thing. One more. That's a fucking lie. You know, Animal Company 17's first sergeant made 'em do 150,000 of these. - Fuck. - Why, why? Oh, they burned down their guard shack smoking. Shucked the shack. Fuck off. One, two three. Yo, Cal, who's that? Is that Captain Vera? Put your fucking foot down. Turn around. Quiet. Pull up your fucking jumpsuit. I want all this shit off of this railing now! You got five seconds or it's mine! Five, four, three, two, one. Something funny, fellas? Who wants to tell me a joke? How about you? You got some funny jokes you wanna tell? No, sir. Bring it in. School circle on the LT. Listen up, gents. We are losing Marines to IEDs. Now, this is an ECM. The ECM is gonna jam any wireless signal for 300 meters. That means the Haji should not be able to command detonate any of their IEDs. Sir, we still plan to keep on the IPs in the dark - until we step off? - No. Higher up wants us to treat the Iraqi police like a partner force. So, that's what we're gonna do. Are we good to go? Dismiss. - Ready? - Hit it. One, two, three. You fucking suck. That sucks, man. Oh, Jesus. It's gonna fucking annoy them to death. All right. What? This is it? Where are the rest of the IPs? These are their team leaders. Fuck me. Okay. All right. All right, listen up. Who here is more loyal to the Mahdi militia than to your own country, huh? Raise your hand. I don't care if you're Shia, Sunni, Baathist, all right? Your loyalty is now to the Iraqi police. Now, somehow, the militia, they know our routes. They know our departure times. We can't have it, okay? So, from this point on, you're gonna go on missions alongside us. You got it? Good. All right. What do you want me to see? Is he putting fucking apples into the pancakes? Fucking sneaking snacks to his friends. Where the fuck did he get an apple from? Come on. Am I in trouble? You're not in trouble, kid. Get over there. - Over here? - Yeah. That's good enough. Look, the boys and me, we saw you making those apple pancakes. I'm sorry about that, sir. I was just trying... - Somebody was talking... - Shut up. They look good. The inmates aren't gonna help you in here. The guards are gonna help you. So, if you wanna do something special, you take care of the guards. And then we take care of you. Which is why you're here. All right? I got two boys outside. They got birthdays coming up. How about you make some apple pies for them? You can do it, a couple of apple pies? You want me to... Yes, sir. Okay. So, what do you need? Uh, for apple pies, apples. All right, grab some apples. You know what, put them in those sacks right there. Yeah, sure. Put three or four on one side, put three or four on the other side. Here's one. Boys. Happy birthday, boys. And what else do you need for the pie? Not just apples, huh? Yeah, I probably need some, uh, cinnamon. Is it your birthday? Or one of your birthdays? Yeah, both of them got birthdays - coming up, yeah. - Cool. So, we're going to need... What did you say? - I just... - Cinnamon? Cinnamon, yeah, sugar. - Sugar, cinnamon, sugar. - Butter, milk. Boys, hold the bags open, he's got a lot more to put in there. Sugar is right over here. Yeah, how much you need? Uh... Oh, fuck! The IED jammer is fucking with our comms. I don't think hitting it's gonna help. Yeah, but it makes me feel better. Hey, guys. Remember that time when the recruiter promised us cool missions, like delivering shit paper to a bunch of action movie guys? I heard that. What would you rather do, firewatch? - No. - Yo, where'd the Iraqi police go? Yo, those motherfuckers peeled off. Nick 2, this is Nick 4. Nick 2, this is Nick 4. This way? Holy shit. Contact front. Standby for blood. Go, go. Twenty-five and five, punch out. Set up security. Hey. Eyes on that gun! Cover that dead space. Run some security. Cover that overhead. I'm here. I'm here, brother. I'm here. I got you. Jaeger... Hey, hey. Focus on me. Hey. Just breathe. Find me a CCP. We need these Marines off the street. Stay with me, okay? That's it. Okay. I got you. - Is my dick okay? - Your dick is fine. Focus on me. Okay. I'm gonna need a CASEVAC, stand by for night line. - Stay with me, okay? - Shit. Okay. I got you. Here. What? What? I'll take it from here, Sergeant Callahan. On you. Go, go, go, go. Wait, Cal. Get that bird inbound. Copenhagen, Copenhagen. - Get the fuck down here. - All right, all right. What the fuck are you doing here in the middle of the night? What's going on? Milk, where's his bed? Fuck, he didn't... He didn't fucking sleep here. No fucking bed up here, bro. What's he saying? Hey. Hey. Where is your bed? Hey, if you're sleeping show me your bed. Hey. Where is your bed? You trigger that? Did you trigger that shit? Where is your fucking bed? You trigger that shit? Where is your fucking bed? - How is he? - He's alive. - It's the last house. - I know. Thanks. Congratulations. Thank you. Call me if you need anything. My practice is only an hour away. You have a visitor. Who came to visit me? I don't fucking know. Come read the fucking paper. No? Fine by me. It's been denied. - Hello? - Hey, Snowball. You awake? Yeah, what's up? I need your help. Yeah, what do you need, man? I know, I know, I know. Hear me out. Hear us out, right? Listen, he just wants to talk. All right? And he wants to help. Uh-huh. Hear him out for me. Let's talk. Let's go. - Is it okay? - Sit down. Sit. Look, I don't think it's right. Fuck yeah. Okay. I don't think you deserve this sentence and, uh... This an apology? You mean I don't need to serve 25 years for fucking defending myself? Look, Clara says there's, uh, a second appeal that we can go after. It's, uh... It's kind of a long shot, but... No, the second appeal is pre-denied. Nichols says it's pre-denied. - It's pre-denied, bro? - What do you mean? What? - Why are we pre-denied? - Why are we pre-denied? What do you mean "we"? Since when has it been "we"? Like you and me? Pre-denied? You're the one that held me down because you wanted to teach me a lesson. - Okay. That's not what happened. - You're the one who's resented me since I was a little kid. - And obviously that's why... - Really? ...you put me in there, that's obviously... - This is not what I came here. - ...why you held me down, because you can't fucking deal with me. It's not what we came here for, bro. Right? Because I'm... I'm just a fuck up to you. - Bro... - I'm a fuck up and I'm a loser to you. Bro, I did everything I could to give you a shot. And you're fucking blaming me? Really? - Everything you could... - Everything I could. - ...to give me a shot. - Yeah, - I did everything I could... - Yeah, holding me down... ...and you're still a fuck up. ...on the fucking ground, you're holding me down, that's everything you could... Oh, you're gonna blame me for that? - Yeah, I'm gonna blame you. - You're gonna blame me? I'm gonna blame you. You could've let me go! - I worked my ass off... - You could've let me go! - ...to be your legal guardian... - Guys? - ...and what do you fucking do? - Guys! - You throw shit at me! - Guys. - I didn't throw shit at you. - You know, I worked my ass off to be your legal guardian. You understand that? That ever occur to you, you know? Who the fuck fed you? Who the fuck put the fucking lights on? Guys, let's not do this. It was me, all right? Why do you think I didn't go active duty? - You think that was for me? - I don't wanna hear how much you resent me anymore. I don't feel like it! - I don't resent you! - Why are you coming here - to make me feel like shit! - I'm just saying I fucking - sacrificed a lot... - Guys, guys! ...and you're fucking throwing shit... - This is not an apology! - Whoa, whoa! I'm the one who's stuck in here! - Visitation is over. - Good. - It's over, happy? - Sir... Sir, I'm sorry. I apologize, visitation is over. It's over. Get up. Let's go. Wait right here. Keep your chin up in there, okay? Yo, why is your chest all fucked up? Hey, back way from the inmate. Back off, sir. - No contact with the inmates. - There's bruises on his chest. I'm sorry, sir, you cannot touch the inmate, back up, please. No contact with the inmates. Let's go, I'm sorry. Oyster, who did that to you, bro? Oyster! Jesus Christ. Hey. - Who's the officer in charge? - Sergeant Capros. - Yeah, I want a word with him. - Regarding? - I wanna file a complaint. - A complaint? - What's your complaint? - I wanna file a complaint. - Go get Sergeant Capros. - He's not around, pal. - Well, go find him, pal. - All right. Hey, you need to get the fuck out my face... - Come on, bro. - ...pal. Thank you, sir. - Thank you. - No, thank you. And don't never get in my fucking face like that again. We got it, we got it, thank you. They need to know what's going on, all right? I think they're the ones doing it, bro. Nichols! Nichols! Hey, Cal. What, you don't return my calls? No, I'm sorry. Listen, I filed the complaint with the warden myself, but I need you to do the petition of transfer. I know. I got it. - I got the message. - No, ASAP, all right, okay? All right. I got them, I got them. - I'm on it. I'm on it. - No, I can't have him in there - a day longer. - Right, I got... I got... Why was the second appeal pre-denied, huh? The facts of the case have been adjudicated already, but they're not gonna hear a second appeal until there's new evidence. Our hands are tied, that's it. What if, uh... What if Dwyer recants his testimony? Why would he do that? I don't... I don't see it happening. No, but what if he did? I'm sorry, Cal. I'm really sorry. I did everything I could. I'm... I got to go, okay? I... I'll file the request for transfer first thing in the morning. I got them, okay? Not you, you stay. It would be a good idea to deny any charges that you made against us. I didn't report anything, I don't know what you're talking about. - You are going to deny... - I didn't report any... - ...any charges made against us. - I didn't report anything. I didn't report anything, I don't know anything about any charges, anybody asked me anything, I won't... - No, no, we didn't say you. - ...say a word. Your nutjob brother. He's a little shit bag like you, ain't he? Don't you fucking talk about my brother. We're done. Hey, what's up, Stacey, how you doing? - What's the problem? - Oh, nothing. Uh, Dwyer here? - Why, what's he done? - Just get him. Okay. D.J.! D.J.! - D.J.! - What? Cal is here. What the fuck did you do? Man, chill out. What's up, Dwyer, how you doing? - Hey, what's up? - Come out here. Let's have a chat. - What you want, man? - Come and have a chat. Why'd you testify against Oyster, hmm? They had possession charges on me, threatening to go after me if I didn't cooperate. Okay. I understand. I can help you out with that. - Mm-hmm. - All right? I need you to do something for me, all right? You got to recant your testimony... - Stop. - ...and say they pressured you. No, dude, I can't do that, I can't go back to jail, man. - Shh. Shh. Shh. - Look, they asked me if Oyster threatened to kill Daley, - he did say it, so... - Just listen. ...I said yes, man. What the fuck are you doing? If you don't recant I will fuck up your world, understand? I will fuck up the rest of... Fuck. Get off me. Fuck. Get the fuck off of him! Fuck you, man! Fuck, fuck! Fuck off, you fucking psycho! Get the fuck off my property! Get the fuck off my property! - Fuck you! - Get the fuck off of our property! You psycho! Dwyer's wife is pressing charges. They want me to throw you off the force. The DA used his rap sheet to make him testify. And what am I supposed to do is by... - Bullshit. - That's coercion. It doesn't give you the right to beat him up, this isn't Iraq. I can lean on Dwyer to drop the charge against you. But I need to give you a two-week suspension so you can screw your head back on. How is he? He won't see me. I'll give the warden a call. Show up with your badge, you'll get to see him. You're not gonna take my badge? Give me a break, Cal. You know we all think his sentence is unfair. Thank you. How you doing? You all right? We're, uh, working on a transfer to La Belle. It's, uh... It's down in Pennsylvania I figured me and the boys will come visit. Did you really wanna be my guardian? Because you could have been my guardian when... you turned 18 but you waited two more years. I was a mess at 18, I was... I was drunk for a year after Mom died. And I didn't wait. I was... I was trying to make it through the police academy. And I told you that he was doing shit to me. I was really clear about what was going on. Yeah, I didn't know who the fuck I was, let alone how to be your dad. I didn't need you to be my dad. I just needed... you to be my brother. I just... I needed somebody to joke around with or... you know, be my wingman at the bar. Like telling me, you know, some of the things that I was feeling and thinking weren't weird or wrong, you know? I just needed someone to have my back. I'm sorry, Teddy, I am. I'm... Do you remember what you said when I totaled the Mazda? You came to visit me in the hospital, and my arm was in a sling. And I said to you, "I'm really sorry, Cal." And do you remember what you said to me? You said, "I do not accept your apology." Guard, I wanna go. I don't. Do not accept your apology. Lets go. Check out time, bitch! - Yeah! Motherfuckers! - Yeah. Yo, where's all the female nurses, man? Hoo-hoo! You need help, bro? Yeah, I do, man. Thanks. Give me a hand. Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You are a fucking idiot! I should have known better. My phone is soaked! I got to redo my hair! Look. Look at his fucking hairdo, man. So that's what you really look like, huh, Milk? Sorry, Sarge, you needed new phone anyway, man. I did you a fucking favor. I've never seen two mermaids making love like that. That shit was beautiful. Wow. Graceful. Graceful. - Thank you. - Welcome, man. Anytime. Really good to see you, man. Missed you, brother. You too, bro. Don't cry, you fucking dicks. Milk had my weed in his pocket. That shit's making me sad. Oh, shit. Well, now I am sorry. - Yeah. What are we drinking? - Yeah. Yeah. Let's get the fuck out of here. Yeah. Where is this hangout? Yeah, I'll show you. I'm doing drums. I got drums. Stand up bass, bro. Stand up bass. ♪ I believe in a thing called love ♪ ♪ Just listen to the rhythm of my heart ♪ ♪ There's a chance we could make it now ♪ ♪ We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down ♪ ♪ I believe in a thing called love ♪ ♪ Ooh! The boys are kinda worried about you. They said you might be going a little Lindsay Lohan. I'm just having trouble sleeping. Yeah, that's it? - That's it. - That's it. Okay. Check this out. I still have all these tiny pieces of shrapnel on my back and my leg. - Jesus Christ. - It's from my fucking leg. Holy fuck! That's right, it takes years to come out sometimes. - It's... - Oh, man. Yeah. I like to keep it around. Can't complain though, man, honestly. I'm getting, like, two grand a month. I might be going to college on this fucking IED. You should. How's Oyster? It's not good. Hello. Oh, look what we got here. That's not mine. That was not there before. It's in your cell. You got a little contraband. A little weed, huh? That's not mine. That's obviously not mine. - Well, who the fuck? - I don't know whose that is - but it's not mine! - It's in your cell. - It's in your toilet. - It's not mine! You know that's not mine. You know that's not Jodie's. You know somebody must have planted that shit! Give me an evidence bag, Sarge. We found contraband. Pick up your shit. Oh, I am being polite, I assure you. I understand, but... But when I tried to see him today, I was told to call this number. Well, how can I find out if he's in solitary? Why the fuck would he be put there? Yeah. I think so. It's a specialty. But I've never seen... I've never seen pasta like this. Oh, thank you. - How is it going here? - Ah, it's just fucked up, bro. What's fucked up? If I shot that guy here, I'd be in jail too. Go on, man. Give it a rest, huh? I almost forgot how annoying you are when you drink. Don't break anything, huh? Hmm. Do you want to take these home? Okay. They're hot and fresh. Is this the anti-war welcoming section? Am I... Am I in the right place? Yeah. - It's a shitty turnout, huh? - Mm. - Hi. - Hi. I, uh, heard about you and... Stewart. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Seriously, did you drag her into this or... How did you get her here? She's been helping out for months. Yeah. Mostly legal stuff, but help where I can. - What? - Enjoy. Yeah. Jane Fonda's giving jarheads free legal advice? - You serious? - Uh-huh. Amazing. - It is. Yeah. - What changed your mind? I haven't changed my mind. It's still a stupid war. Do you like my brother more than me? - Of course not. - Do you? - No. - Hi, Cal. 'Cause I understand. I get it. I've been thinking. He's a fun guy. - I'm not fun. - You are fun, bro. - I love you. - I love you too. Yeah. He's my best friend. He's my best friend. I see that. He's in love with you. Shh. - That's my night, so... - Wow. What? What did you say? Everybody's trying to have a good time. - What? - You should take it easy. What's up? What, bro? - It's all good. - That's what I thought. That's what I thought. Now, what was that? It's all right. It's all right. Sorry. Fuck you. Fuck you. What the hell are you doing? Fuck. Sit down. - Fuck. - What the fuck? You good? You all right? - You okay? - Yeah. Freaking leg almost fell off. It's not fucking funny. What the fuck is wrong with you? Do not go fucking dark on us, bro. We all got fucking problems. All these boys. We need you. All right? Now, do you know how much you mean to us, Cal? Now, you got us home. Yeah, he's right. You got us home, Cal. No, we love you. No, we're right here. We're not going anywhere. The fuck are you looking at? You're good. You're good. - Wanna get up? - Yeah. - Come on. - Come on. Help me up. Wanna sit on the fucking Jamaican dirt all day? - Come on. - Come on. - Come on. - Wanna go dance? - Yeah? - Yeah. Get some shots? I'll move this dumpster. - What? - Yeah. You wanna move the dumpster? - I'll move the dumpster. - All right. - You're moving the dumpster? - All right. Move the dumpster! Just move it. All right. Hold on. Hold on. Go. Wait. No. Wait. That wasn't me. Just roll with me, like 10 to 15... - Does this person have a record? - No record. Okay. Five to eight. Maybe? I'd say five to eight. Aiding and abetting, of course trespassing, destruction of state property. Consecutive sentences can add up. Okay. So say it's non-violent. So what's that? A class C? I don't know. It would depend on the perp and the circumstances... or juvenile rights practice. I don't really have a lot of experience in adult criminal cases. - Cal... - Hmm. Why did you drive all the way down here? I wanted to tell you something that I thought you might appreciate. Uh, right after, uh, Jaeger got blown up, he was, uh... He was about to get lifted out and, uh, and right before he passed out, I'm with him and, uh... he starts... I mean, he was... He just started saying your name. A lot of times. And, uh... yeah, I just thought you might like to know that. Mm-hmm. What's the fucking deal here? Why are we called like troops at 10:00 p.m.? Bring the boys here at 2200, you know? There he is. Hey, baby boy. All right. What's with the suspense, man? Pins and needles here, man. Getting married? No. No. He's auditioning for American Idol. - Motherfucker. - Cool. I'm gonna break him out. Get the fuck out of here, man. Cal, what are you talking about, man? His, uh... His transfer's been approved. I found out they're gonna move him next week to La Belle, so... I'm gonna do it. It's five inmates, two COs. What the fuck? What are you... What the fuck are you saying? Bro, you're fucking tripping, man. Yeah, I can pull it off. Get him across the border before an APB goes out. Feds aren't gonna track him to Canada. Are you being fucking serious right now? You're gonna get fucking killed is what you're gonna get. - Fucking listen to yourself. - Oh, yeah. Who the fuck do you think you are? We're all fucking here for you, and we all fucking miss him. Yeah. I miss him too, you know? We all do. Let's get a fucking shot, go to Gigi's, - get you a fucking lap dance. - Yeah. You need to get fucking laid, bro. Yeah, man. I'm not asking. I don't need anything from you guys. I wanted to let you know. Yeah, I just wanna let you know. - This is bullshit. - Cal. Go fucking talk to him. Yeah, he'll listen to you. Fuck. Snowball, you taking a nap or what? Dude, my bad. I'm on it. Got two new payloads. Copy that. Rogo. Moving arm to the left. I did some thinking and, uh, I'm on board. What are you fucking saying? You were supposed to talk him out of it. - He needs us. - You were supposed - to talk him out it. - Couple years of jail - is nothing to him. - Listen to me. Now, this isn't how we do things. We love Cal. He's our fucking brother, but this is fucking wrong, bro. - He's right. - Oh, he's right? - Yeah. - The fuck are you talking about? This is how we do things, Milk. This is how we always... Dude, what are you saying to me? I'm in. - You're fucking in? - Yeah, I'm in. - Fuck you. - Yeah? You piece of shit. We fucking... We... You fuckin' leave me like this, you motherfucker. - Whoa. Chill. - I'm not leaving you anywhere. Fuck you. I'm just fucking standing up for Oyster, bro. He's gonna get fucking killed in there. - You're right. - He's gonna get killed in there. Somebody's gonna get fucking killed. Well, at least this is a fucking fighting chance. We owe him that much. Now, I failed him in that fucking bar. I'm not gonna fail him again. I'm not leaving him in there 25 years to fucking rot. Fuck that. You do whatever the fuck you want, man, but I'm in. I'm in. You guys are out of your fucking mind. Yo, Milk. Yo? Putting him on a train won't work, Cal. Even if the border patrol let's them through before the APB goes out, his passport's gonna be in the system, right? So they're gonna know he's Canada. Check that out. See that refinery across the river? That's Sorko. That's my company's sister refinery. I've been to the other side just to work for a day. We take a crew boat to Canada everyday - without any border patrol. - Hmm. Listen, don't get me wrong, the security is tight, but all we need to do is get him on that boat with a uniform and an ID card, a legit one which I can get, and then he can just walk out on the other side. - He just swipes through? - He swipes through. That's it. The company is just gonna think he's another employee. - No fucking way. - Well, well, well. - Yo. - How you doing, boys? How the fuck did you know we were here? You spying on us? - Jaeger. - Oh, nice. You in? I'm in. Are you sure? All right. I want to run through this one more time. Eyes on, Jaeger. Okay. That's the overpass. Now, this is the service road. And this is river road coming underneath. That's fucking abandoned. That becomes the highway. And we got trees in this ravine. All right. Bus is gonna be coming straight down here. It's gonna turn onto US 90, okay? Now, Jaeger, I want you posted up top. I need you to shoot out the front right tire. - Yeah. All right. - Okay? He's gonna feel way more than a flat in the back. Once he hits the tire, Milk, you jam the radio. All right? Now, you're tailing the bus since prison, so don't get made, but don't fall too far behind either. I figure, what, you can see it, you can jam it? - You got it. - Okay. I figure the bus will come to a stop somewhere right around here. Me, I'm gonna be posted up here under the overpass. I'll be tailing him on the service road. Snowball, you'll be over here on this road with me. Now, I'm gonna cut through the trees, drop a flare. I'll board and extract Oyster. All right. Now, once I get him to you, you gotta haul ass out of there. - Yeah. - All right? I'm gonna take him to the dock and I'm gonna put him on the 8:30 a.m. Sorko ferry over to Canada. Takes about 10, 15 minutes, so he should be scanning in on the Canadian side... ...9:00 a.m. at the latest. - Badges good to go? - Yeah. Looks good. All right. What the fuck? Hey, what's up? You okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. I need to talk in person. All right. What's the matter? I'm worried about Cal. I think he's up to something. What? Why do you think that? He came to my office today and gave me power of attorney, that means that I can sign things for him if he dies. - Yeah. I know what it means. - And the other night he was asking me about sentences for a prison break. A prison break? What are you talking about? Did you know Oyster is getting transferred tomorrow morning? Look, whatever you're thinking, I'm sure everything's fine. Just... I can't do this right now, okay? I got to get up early. I'm sorry. No. You're right. It's okay. I, uh... I'm sorry I came over without calling. What time you have to get up? Uh, 7:30. I got the early shift at the garage. So you're alarm's set for 7:30? - Yeah. - 7:15? - Yeah. - Which is it? What? Clara. Clara, what's going on? Why are you cleaning your rifle? What the fuck? I'm going on a hunting trip. So you hunt with a silencer. Jesus. Enough. What is this? This is insane. You're going to get caught. - What do you care? - I care... I care about Cal. Maybe I don't wanna see him get hurt. - Oh, you care about Cal? - And I care about you. Well, why don't go fucking go to stupid old Cal's bedroom? Maybe I don't wanna see you doing something stupid. - Ow. Fuck. Shit. - Oh, my God. I'm sorry. No. Nothing. It's fine. I just, uh... I got a little shrapnel. Fuck. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no. It's not you. Will you get those, um... Some tweezers on the table there? Just fucking sometimes I step on it wrong. Do you need help? No. I got it. - Let me help you. - No. It's fine. - I can do it. - I got it. I have a better angle. Pull your shorts up. Yeah. - Does it hurt? - No. Feels great. I'm sorry. You got it. Thanks. There's four channels. Now, you turn the knobs to adjust for frequency... then press enter. The fuck are you doing here, hmm? - No. No. - Take it easy. - Take it easy. - Jaeger? - Calm down. - Jaeger? Calm down. Shh. Shh. Keep your voice down. - No. Fuck this. Fuck, Clara... - Listen, I'll be his alibi. If he needs one, God forbid... I'm his alibi. Now, listen... you bring him back to me. You hear me? Let's go. Where the fuck is Milk? - He's out. - What? What? Yeah. He's out. He's out. What the fuck are you talking about? He's out? - Listen. Listen. Listen. - Rachel? - No, no, no, no. - Dude, he's got a family. It doesn't matter right now, all right? I got the jammer. I can operate it, all right? I can do both, all right? I'll scope it out. I'll fucking jam it. I'll be the getaway car. - Cal, he's right. - We're good. We're gonna make this work. This is not fucking good. This is not fucking good. All right? Your vehicle can't get IDed. This is a fucking disaster. You're the overpass, right? - Yeah. - I can jam it - from there. - Yeah. If I can see it, I can jam it. That's even fucking better, bro. And I'll go with you when you take Oyster out. As soon as you shoot out at that tire, I'm fucking down there with you. - Fuck! - Hey! Hey. Hey. Focus. Focus, all right? - Are we calling this? - We're not... - No. - We're not fucking calling it. The plan stays the same. You should get him off that bus, all right? We'll get him across. All right. Big Bird's wheels up at 0700. See you there. I'll see you. I'll see you. Turn around. Face the wall. One man, one seat. Kilo Actual, this is Kilo Two. Radio check.
