"Children Care Center" "Tsai" Ready... start! 39 seconds. "Ar Dee" Ready... start! Ready... start! Ready and start! What's mine is yours. What's yours is mine. Here... Thanks! Did you make that? Yes! Hey, that's my candy! So? Tsai! Help! Help! Dee! Tsai! Police! Out of the car! A car hit the crowd at noon today in downtown, leaving 5 people dead and 18 injured. The driver was Miu Kwok Lung, the CEO of a listed company. Someone at the scene recorded Miu crashed into the crowd at high speed and stopped after hitting a tour bus head-on. Miu then used a cutter and killed himself by cutting his cervical aorta. He was pronounced dead on the scene. A task force has been set up to investigate. The Police allegedly got an anonymous tip predicting the accident at the scene. Since the accident earlier this month involving a heavy goods vehicle in Taipo, this is the second such accident in a month. The Police received an anonymous tip on both incidents. Hello, Bill? I just saw the news. You were right. If we could decode the file sooner, we could have minimized the casualties. What should we do with the data? I'll keep digging. This is too big for us. We didn't hack into an ordinary database. It's probably a secret service file. Bill, keep the file safe. Hello? Relax! I'm a cop! Stop the bus! Open the door! Don't! There's a bomb. Control, where is Ching To? No.25 bus on the Eastern Corridor. OK Two suspicious vehicles are in pursuit. To, in position. Jump! No! Suspicious vehicles closing in. Listen to me. On my count to three, let's jump. One. You tricked me. You said on your count to three! You looked so cool when you jumped in. Could do better if you got me a chopper. Who do you think you are? Tom Cruise? What about you? Fukuyama Masaharu? Yiu Ho Yee, independent reporter? That's just your cover. M.I.T. grad. Electrical Engineering and IT major. Up-and-coming hacker, who specializes in malware. You were arrested in the U.S. in 2016. But the NSA hired you instead and dropped all charges against you. We found out prior to the crash in downtown, in a cafe' in Wanchai, you tipped off the Police about the crash, despite being surrounded by CCTV. That means you didn't want people to die. If we're on the same side, why not work together? Go ahead and detain me if you have proof. That won't be necessary. Sign your name and you're free to go. We'll tell the media you left the precinct. Someone just tried to kill me. I'm dead if I walk out of here. Probably just cripple you. These people have backing. Bodyguards won't help. Good Luck! Sir! About 2 weeks ago, I wanted to write about human trafficking I managed to hack into an overseas database. Bill! But they caught on. We only managed to download part of the file. They started their attack. Our security system will crash in 30 seconds. Most of those files were encrypted. After we decoded them, we found out someone intends to disrupt Taipo and downtown. I believe the Police is covering up for them. What makes you say that? Among the files I hacked into, I found archive footages and texts. The texts were in English, but incomplete like the archives. I deduced from the texts, there's an underground organization abroad. This organization kidnaps children and trains them into field agents. These agents have already infiltrated the Police around the world. What's up? The Security Wing (SW) will take over. To, take a break. Grace, kill the mic. If SW wants us to hand over the case, the ACP should call us. He's on his way. Then let's wait till he's here. Excuse me, we need to continue. No! She's involved in two major attacks. This is definitely our case. Cheng, the girl just started to talk. If you pull the plug now, everything will go down the drain. Chong, pack up everything and keep them under wraps. Yes, Sir! Sorry! The girl mentioned dirty cops on the force. I was thinking who should I guard against and you waltzed in. Should I guard against you? Aren't you a cop? Ching To, CIB. 6 years ago, he went undercover. Since his return, he's often out of line. Should I guard against him too? I won't dismiss your doubts. But who knows who's dirty? Cheng Sir! What did you tell her? By protocol, everything related to the case, I can only report to my commanding officer. SW will take over the case. We're waiting to hear from the ACP. Yes, Sir! You wore us out. We need a break. Care for a late snack? Don't forget what I said. What did he say? Nothing important. Such an attitude. You know about him and his poker face. SW is a sensitive department. He's not entirely wrong. Still! You were his mentor. Don't say that. That's ancient history. He now holds a key position. Not me. I'm old school. Once a mentor, always a mentor. Thank you. When you see me every day, kneel, kowtow, serve me tea, and address me as Shifu. Pour you a libation and burn incense too? What about the guy who went after Yiu Ho Yee? He must have had military training. Any update on the crash in downtown? According to the assessment of the task force terrorists had the dirt on Miu Kwok Lung. He did it to protect his family. Miu was in finance and loan. His clients are mostly Europeans. After the incident, the stock price of his company and his partners" companies took a dive. Someone intends to use the attack to disrupt the economy. We should alert INTERPOL. I suggest we contact the Myanmar Police to get the hard disk Yiu Ho Yee mentioned, because it contains deployment plans of suspected terrorists that may endanger other countries. Agree. Me too. I'll contact the Myanmar Police. Cheng Sir, put Yiu Ho Yee in a safe house ASAP. Yes, Sir! Keep this case to yourselves. No one else must know about it. Yes, Sir! Hey! - About the case... - Tonight... Sorry, go ahead! Sorry, I took your case. Don't be silly. It's under your department. What were you saying? It's not important. Here's the elevator. Happy birthday to you... Wait! Make a wish! Think hard... it'll come true. - Close your eyes. - Make a wish first. The longer the better. You're late. Here's your present. This piece of second-hand trash? Some friend you are! It took me all night to bid for it. Give it back if you don't want it. If I don't mind this crap, don't nag. Why does an old man like kiddie stuff? Everyone has a child inside. But not you. You won't understand. I don't think you'd wear it. Of course not. I'd keep it for 20 years and auction it. Cheng! Happy birthday! Thank you. I meant to remind you in the elevator. No need. I remember. Thank you Yip Sir, let's take a picture. OK... Let me just take one picture. I have to go. Happy birthday. You can't wait for me to take one picture? When was the last time we had a drink? "Hong Kong Police Force Organisation Chart" The girl mentioned dirty cops on the force. I was thinking who should I guard against and you waltzed in. Should I guard against you? After we decoded them, we found out someone intends to disrupt Taipo and downtown. I believe the Police is covering up for them. I deduced from the text, there's an underground organization abroad. This organization kidnaps children and trains them into field agents. This organization kidnaps children and trains them into field agents. These agents have already infiltrated the Police around the world. Ching-ching always loves to eat ice cream every day. What do you think, Sir? Morning! Ching-ching, if you want ice cream, tell Daddy, OK? OK! What flavor do you like? Durian and chocolate. You're so greedy. Bye, Daddy! Bye! Sir, you come back and have dinner tonight? Cheng Sir, I spoke to the Myanmar Police. You leave for Myanmar in an hour. Bring back Yiu Ho Yee's hacked files. In case there's mole among us, we should limit the people involved. But considering your backup, I picked someone for you. I hope you won't object. I trust your arrangement. Send them in. Sir! Sir! Cheng Sir and Ching Sir go to Myanmar. The local elite force will help you. Yip Sir will hold down the fort at CIB, monitor the operation and provide backup. Yes, Sir! Too low tech, right? No, I played with it when I was little. Everyone from our generation did. Better than cell phones. I'm quite attached to it. Do you recognize me? 2 years ago in Fanling, I was under you in an anti-terrorist drill. I don't recall. How unlike you. Maybe it's an occupational hazard. CIB's top criterion in choosing an undercover is the ability to recognize a face. I was a UC for several years. You don't look like it. As a UC, you're too obvious. The more you try to cover up, the easier it is to blow your cover. Obvious can be intentional. Today, we have a joint operation with the Hong Kong Police. The objective is to safeguard the evidence of their case and arrest all related suspects. Intel shows target is in a crowded place. In order not to alert the target, we'll go inside disguised as civilians. If we encounter any attack or resistance, we swear to protect our people against the enemy. Yes, Sir! North Gate secure. Roger that! Keep quiet! Get out! Keep quiet! Get out! Go... Alpha Team in position. Breaching in 3 seconds. What's going on? No visual. No comms either. To, do you copy? Men down. Send backup. Cheng, talk to me! Are we back up? ...hard disk... How much longer? Still no visual. Comms back up. To, do you copy? What's the status? Ambushed by an assassin. We're in pursuit to retrieve the hard disk. Locate them. Visual not steady. John, are you there yet? I have the hard disk. B Point! Reload! Go! Go! Hop on! Landing! Wait for me! I have the hard disk. They're not on board. They outgun us. Chopper is hit. Pending your order! Yip Sir! Pull out! John, pull out. Pull out! Go! Yip Sir, the hard disk is a blank. Ambush and CIB comms went dead. It's possible we have a mole. Regarding the operation, 15 people in the know, including us. What about Yiu Ho Yee? Why didn't the assassin kill her but want to kidnap her? If someone threatened Miu Kwok Lung, she might be threatened as well. Is it possible Yiu Ho Yee is a terrorist? Yip Sir, what's your take? Anything is possible. Does that include the missing Ching To? Should we suspect him? Myanmar Police cleared the scene. But still no sign of him. The point is, he was the last person to touch the hard disk I'm afraid I can't keep up. While I worry about my colleague's safety, you're questioning his loyalty. You don't give a damn about his safety, because you're anxious to get answers? Maybe I dropped the ball. Ching To worked for me for a long time. He's my buddy. I will not suspect him. What if I told you I have intel Ching To is on the take? I can vouch for him. Safe house! Yes, Sir! Hold it! What now? Any word on To? Pending the Myanmar Police's report. - You came back with John. - Didn't I make myself clear? Why didn't anyone stay behind to find out? It's a human life. So you noticed? Then why did you order them to pull out? To disappeared because of you. I must find him. I will let them know he's not a dirty cop. He came back for me. He can't be dirty. It's useless for me to stay in Myanmar. Yiu Ho Yee is our only lead. Trust me. Sorry! I'm sorry! Cheng Sir is here. Why is the hard disk a blank? Did you make it up? What do you mean? There were heavy casualties in Myanmar. Start telling us the truth. What about Bill? Dead. Who are you? What's your connection with the terrorists? You want to bury Hong Kong with you? Bill is dead. I won't say another word. On account of your possible false statement, and connection to two terrorist attacks, you're now under arrest. Yes, the hacked files will be treated as a permanent leak. Our Hong Kong agent has confirmed the hacker knew nothing about our list of agents, and is clueless about details and timeline of our global operation. The hacker has shut down the entire data system. We won't be able to execute any plan unless the system is unlocked. All of our efforts over the years will just go down the drain. Tung, you should really know, the aftermath of this will indeed be terrible if this incident is not reversed immediately. Grasp your time. Mr. Tung, HQ has reverted. They still can't unlock the files. We must find the hacker. Did we get what I want in Myanmar? I have the hard disk. Car 1, in 400m reroute to... Get down! Why you? What do you want? I didn't really know at first. I'm actually a greedy and righteous cop. It's so bloody contradictory. Until Yiu Ho Yee gave me the answer. I haven't been a sell-out yet because the price was not right. Cut the crap! You have Yiu Ho Yee, hand her over. I just told you, I chose money. You know how much she's worth on the market. I'm giving you a chance to work with me. I can plead your case in the future. I recorded this just now. You were next to your aide when he was shot. Why did the gunners shoot at him and not you? Is it possible you sent those thugs? Quit your good cop act. Aren't you tired? Tsai! Blanks? You're Tsai? Emma, does Ching-ching still have the fever? Better. I think it's the water. Why did we move here? She can't adapt. Honey, Anyway, I'll support whatever reason it is. We'll talk when you get home. Emma? Poor baby. Don't cry. We're not against having a family. But you can't turn your back and walk away. Take your pick. Mr. Tung, I won't do it again. Emma! We taught you people you love will suffer. See? Honey! 5 more years. We'll let you go in 5 years. You drew a good lot. You're with Cheng Sir. Really? We taught you people you love will suffer. See? Do you recognize me? 2 years ago in Fanling, I was under you in an anti-terrorist drill. I don't recall. Dee! Tsai! Drink some water. Just kill me. Don't waste your time. In 2013, you became an independent reporter, and went to the Philippines to cover the red light district. You were there for 3 years. In 2017, you fell off the grid and became active only recently. You disappeared because of her. An M.I.T. honor student became a reporter because you needed an excuse to look for someone in unusual places. Unfortunately, by the time you found her, she was already dead. Why did you dig that up? My little sister died tragically. It was horrible. You grabbed her. When she ran away from the camp, you sent her to a brothel. She was only 8 years old! Why didn't you just kill her? Even if you kill me, I won't unlock the files Ching To is not the bad guy. He's been acting on my orders. In order to secure your hard disk in Myanmar, he had to disappear. I have the hard disk. I have the hard disk. Good job. He took you here on my order to protect you He's part of a counter terrorist ghost team under the Hong Kong Police. IFF, the Invisible Frontline Force. Because the IFF is highly confidential, it is outside the establishment, and they report directly to me. If it's highly confidential, why are you telling me? I want you to help us fight terrorists. I want to know why they wish to capture you. Because I locked their data system. I didn't have time to download everything. But it dawned on me to send them a virus to paralyze their system, stop them from operating it and deny them access to their database. The only way to unlock it, is my iris. We're currently outside the home of missing SP of Police, Cheng Chun Yin. The Police is inside combing for evidence. Regarding the kidnapping of Yiu Ho Yee the key witness to the crash in downtown... Relax! Your daughter is safe with us. Thank you so much. Did you know someone is looking for a buyer for Yiu Ho Yee? I didn't know. They also claim to have the hard disk. Who is it? Probably the missing cop from Myanmar. Your old partner. He's with CIB. He's not my partner. Find out where he stands. Set up a meeting with him in your name. See. Wait to hear from me. "03:00 Cheung Sha Wan Cooked Food Market" When Cheng escaped through the window, he left behind a blood sample. Based on his DNA we confirm he's your childhood friend Tsai. What's mine is yours. What's yours is mine. Over the years, while looking for you friend, you have been feeding us intel about this secret organization. Why? I'm sure they kidnapped my friend. He's innocent. If he didn't come back to save me back then, I would have been the bad guy. Sir! Here's your chance. We intend to set up a new task force, that may help you find your friend. Sir, strictly speaking, he's a victim. Can I speak to him before the operation? Back then, he might have been a victim. But today, you have no idea what he has become. If you're soft with him, will he reciprocate? Sir, he must have his reasons. He took bullets for me in Myanmar. The other day when he fired those shots, he aimed to miss. He didn't know they were blanks. I think he never intended to kill me. OK! 5 minutes. Leung Sir will breach in 5 minutes. Yes, Sir! Thank you, Sir! Follow your orders. Do you still play this? Yiu Ho Yee, the hard disk. Name your price. When we were little, inside the orphanage, we were great with the Rubik's Cube. We were naughty and the teachers hated us. But they also knew we were smart. It drove them crazy. Don't try my patience. This is your file. We have been apart for so long, many things have become fuzzy. I only remember the way you laughed when you were happy. He's an old friend?! Sounds like he wants to catch up. First you tell me you want money. Now you talk about the good ole' days. Make up your mind. We're running out of time. Tsai, let me help you. Name your price. Ching Sir, your Boss from CIB is here. "Private number” "I am Ching Sir's snitch."” "03:00 Cheung Sha Wan Cooked Food Market" I'm so happy to see you both. To, I thought I got you killed. Seeing you alive and in one piece, I'm SO relieved. And you, Cheng! I thought you were kidnapped by terrorists. When in fact you had a date. Care to share this happy occasion with me? I will tell you what you want to know. But right now, you need to leave. You said I'm your Shifu, right? But your snitch knows more than I do. Should I answer you when you call me Shifu? Cheng, do you know what people said about you behind your back? But you still have my vote. You think I suspect you both? No! The answer is no! Because I trained both of you. If I had doubts about either of you, then I must be a complete failure. But the fact is, I am a failure. Suspicious character at Exit A. 3 more at Exit C. All teams regroup. If you have nothing to say, call the boys and we'll celebrate. No thanks. You should leave. I told you to leave! Time to say goodbye. Make Ching To Kill him. Kill him! Are you nuts? Tell him you'll trade if he takes him out. Go! Put pressure on it. Press! Is this an operation? Yes! This is an operation. They want the swap in Spain. Ching Sir will pose as the seller and hand over Yiu Ho Yee. The local G.E.O. will back us up. We'll split into 3 teams. A Team, Ching Sir, Johnson and Chiu. B Team, assault team and sniper team. C Team, tech support and BG team. Leung Sir, last night at 19:00, the nanny and Cheng Chun Yin's daughter left the flat with two men. She's probably still in Hong Kong. Keep looking. I need an exact location. Yes, Sir! It's Mr. Tung. Yes? We still don't know Ching To's motive, but I think he's tied to the Hong Kong Police Don't underestimate him. Yes. Mr. Tung! Yes? It has been 5 years. When can I leave with my daughter? The nerve of you to bring that up! We made you an SP and invested so much resources in you. What have you done for us? Now you even blew your cover. We still won't give up on you, but will help you start over. Have you considered how much time and resources were wasted on you? Never bring up leaving again. Do you and your daughter want the gifts we have given you? Yes! Very good! This specialty from the Philippines, is part of my childhood memory. Have a candy. Sugar can help you relax. Thanks for risking your life to help us. I should say, I have waited too long for this. If you have doubts, it's not too late to say no. Don't worry, my sister will be watching over me. I'm well prepared for this. Mr. Tung, we've got the location. Target's locked. C Team, ready? In position. OK, wait for your order over there. Ching Sir, 9 o'clock. 5 o'clock. Two targets at 3 o'clock. 10 o'clock. Mr. Tung, he's here. Any minute now. I'll give you half the money. You killed my buddy. That made me very upset. It's now a different deal. Your life is part of the package. Sorry! I can't help you. Demon, give him the other phone. Talk to me. You have no right to settle the score. I don't? I'll drop the phone now, and talk to you after I ride on a bull. You want to play games? I'm happy to oblige. If you don't hand over Yiu Ho Yee, fine! I'll make Hong Kong foot the bill. I'm partial to deadly games. Apart from this one, there are three more. All set to go off during rush hour. Boom! Boom! Boom! If you don't work for the Hong Kong Police, you don't give a damn. Looks like you have tricks up your sleeves. Yes, I can call off the trade. Demon, Cheng, leave! Fine! You better not grovel on your knees. You think you can pull a fast one in the tunnel? You can't fool me. Target's locked. You have no bargaining chip. I solved all the problems. System unlocked. Restoring. If you wish to kneel, there's still time. Restoring failed. Someone is hacking in at ultra high speed. Exit point at your 12 o'clock, 800m away. You wanted to call it off. Now you want to continue? You think you have the real Yiu Ho Yee? C Team, ready? In position. OK, wait for your order over there. Roger. The real one is viewing your secrets. Didn't you notice a blip on your monitors? During the blip, we inserted a pre-recorded visual. You thugs are too dead to play the endgame. Still don't get it? The iris scan didn't unlock anything. It's in fact, another virus. Kill the girl! Ching Sir, I found the bombs. I can track them to their base. Armor integrity 15%. Evacuate... Go! Go! Run, Ho Yee! Go! Sis, help me! Armor integrity 5%. Evacuate... Armor integrity 3%. Evacuate... Their base is not in Spain. It's in Hong Kong...! Call CTRU! Armor integrity 1%. Evacuate... Police! Freeze! There's a bomb! Clear out! Demon, Cheng! Kill that cop! W-A-L-L Reload! Go! Destroy the system. Your daughter is safe. Don't be afraid. I'm a Policeman. Come here. After all these years, this is the only thing I can do for you. For 30 years, you took the heat for me. If you hadn't come back for me, the one they have taken should have been me. All these years... how could you stand it? How could you? Dee, it's OK. It's over. It's OK. We're brothers. Whatever I still owe you, in the next life... Come on... didn't you want to save your pal? Dee, see you around. Let go! Let go! Let go!
