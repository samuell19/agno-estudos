- Sorry for the delay, Belmonte. - It's okay. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Over here. - Let's go. Let's go. It's very interesting, Belmonte. Very interesting. I think it's not finished, right? No. I don't think so. Well, you can finish it at home. That's the one my wife chose, right? No, she chose that one. That one? I really like this one. I will take this one as well. - I will take both. - Both? Yes, of course. This one. I'll take both. Excellent. Same price, I imagine. It would be double. No, for each painting. Yes, the same. All right. Will you deliver them? Of course, just tell me where to and when. I'll take care of it. Perfect. All right. - Bearer check? - Crossed check. Belmonte, is everything okay? Yes. Should I call Celeste? No, I was just watching her. - Her mom is picking her up today, right? - Yes. See you. Thank you. Mom. - I thought you were coming with Celeste. - She's at school. Celeste is having a baby brother. What do you mean, a baby brother? Mom, Jeanne is pregnant. Sorry, how is Jeanne? - I don't know, she's fine. - And Celeste, how did she take it? She's happy. Dad. - Javi. - And Marcelo? In the chamber. Son of a bitch, fuck you. You scared me. Fucker, who else could it be? I don't know, I had a vision. - What are you doing here, Marcelo? - I'm looking for a client's coat. Dad can't find it. He doesn't know where it is. Why are Mom and Dad here? We agreed they wouldn't come anymore, that you'd take care of this. I don't know, Javi. They don't come for two days, then they come to check what I'm doing. - They don't trust I can do things right. - What things? There's nothing to do here. They look after the clients and the store, the temperature of the chamber, and the phone calls. What phone calls? It's been ages since that phone rang. Javi, what do you want? - Could you deposit that into your account? - Again? You're a pain in the ass. I don't want to have all that money at home. Did you sell the car? Hey. I told Mom about Jeanne. Did she give birth? Not yet. - And what did Mom tell you? - What is she supposed to say? Nothing. And you? What are you up to? Javi, don't you want to come home for dinner, to be with the kids? No, I just came to give you that. I'm very busy. Okay, call me later. See you. - See you. - Bye, Marce. Look. Look at the current. Today it's going to the other side. Hi. - How did it go? - Well. Yes? Sure? Dad... Dad, what is a quarantine? Dad... Dad... - What? - What is a quarantine? - To be old, like your dad. - Come on. Nothing. In the old days, some people isolated others, or something like that. - That. - And for how long? It depends. Quarantine means for 40 days. But it could be for 40 days, for 20, 100, the rest of your life. And why did they get isolated? Imagine that... when people from other places arrived, before going to the port, they were sent to an island where they checked that no one was sick, so that... they didn't arrive with a lethal disease they could transmit to another person, and that person to another, until all ended up dead. And was it like a health prison? Yes, something like that. And a lot of people died, because they all got infected. Yes. I guess a lot of people died. A lot. - Can I finish my homework tomorrow? - No. - Why? - Because you can't, Celeste. If you finish it now, you can have ice cream. Can I have some? - Yes, but you have to finish it. - Okay. - Yes? - Yes. Hello, Celeste, honey. Javi... Hello. Are you there? - Hello. - Jeanne. How are you? I was serving ice cream. She's in the bedroom. She's okay. Yes, she ate. Yes. Do you want to talk to her? Okay, wait. She's asleep. Yes. She's asleep. What, do you want me to wake her up? Yes, she's okay. Yes, she did her homework. Yes. Fine. And how are you? What, do you still feel nauseous? I don't know. I don't know how many weeks it is. How could I know how many weeks? But are you okay? Okay. Good to hear. No. You know what? I want Celeste to stay longer with me. More time. Jeanne. Jeanne, it's just one more day. No, Jeanne. Jeanne. If not now, when? Okay, let's talk, but not at the printer. Bye, Dad. Celeste. Bye. - Javi! - Jessie! - How are you? - Fine, and you? Fine. Do you always come here? - Every time I can, yes. - Good. And your daughter? She's great, all grown-up. - Is she? - Yes. Are you working? Well, now I'm here. No, I'm always working. Javi. - Yes. - Did you come alone? Yes, it is what it is. - Your dad is downstairs. - Yes, I saw him. - Did you? - Yes, I saw him. - Okay. - How is your family? - Very well. - I'm glad. - Okay, see you. - Yes, goodbye. I think it's starting. I'd better get going. Dad. - Hello. - How are you? So, did you like it? Yes. The other day, I met with the mother of a friend of yours. - What friend? - Regueiro. Francisco Regueiro. He's not my friend. He's not my enemy, but he's not my friend. His mother told me her son was your friend. She must have told you that to get a discount. What? Yes. Shall we? Let's go. And this one? - Over there, on the living room wall. - Where? - Over here. - You tell me. Please, over here. It'll look good here. I think so, too. Thank you, Mrs. Conde. No need to thank me. I think... Is that okay? My friends had better luck with you, Belmonte. What friends? Mrs. Conde, you are beautiful. I'm sorry. Sure. - Just a bit. - No. - Come on. - No. - Just a little bit. - No, Javi. Come on, don't be mean. Javi. Just a bit. Little baby. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Look, if you want me to go with you to the doctor or anything, let me know. Okay, thank you, but no. I won't need that. I mean, in case Dionisio disappears again. He won't disappear. He has in the past. He's going through a process. I'm also going through a process. Did you think about what I asked? I need to spend more time with Celeste, and I think she needs it as well. Yes, Javi, but I want Celeste to be... with her baby brother, to have a schedule, order... all of that. - But one thing doesn't replace the other. - You know what, Javi? I want to start a family. Javi. What? Javi. What? - Don't be like that. - How do you want me to be? - Listen. - No, Jeanne. Wait. Javi, wait. What? If you want, next weekend, you pick her up on Friday and bring her back on Monday. Okay? Yes. Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Will you take care? Bye. Dad, I have a craving. - A craving? For what? - For a sandwich cookie. - Can I have one? - Okay. Let's go. - Do you have homework? - Yes. Do you want to paint? Okay. - Charcoal? - Okay. Celeste... - What? - Let's go. Okay. Did you see that boat, the big one over there? - Yes. What country is it from? - I don't know, I can't see the flag. Check the letters on its side. Is it Italian? It's Chinese. How can you be so sure? Because it's Chinese. Do you remember Juanse? Yes. He gave me a pen with three colors. That's great. - Do you want to see it? - Sure. It's great. I wrote three letters. A gray one, a blue one, and the pink one will be the last one, and I'll write that I like him since last year. Do you like him that much? - No? - But I won't tell him to marry me. Don't be jealous. - I'm not jealous, but... - Are you dizzy? - Are you dizzy? - No. - No. - None of us. - Are you sure? - Yes. If you don't leave us here in quarantine, we'll be back soon. Go. Don't worry, the tie is fine. Honey. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Excuse me. - What where you thinking about? - Nothing. Nothing. Aren't you cold with short sleeves? No. I'm sorry. And? Only these paintings will be in the video? We talked about this. You know the work I like the most is with nudes. Besides, it's the most humorous. But you have a lot of material, a lot to show. The people that come to the museum are older people, families, you know. You don't want to provoke, like you've been doing for a while. You're not 20 anymore, am I right? No, I'm not 20. They'll call you from the printer for some sketches for the catalog. Do you need anything else from us? No, I don't think so. Do you want to see the presentation again? The interview will be that long? The interview is locked. Usually, it's 17 minutes. This lasts 23 because it's very good, right? Impressive. Thank you very much, Aguerre. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. - Can we give Juanse a ride? - Of course, hop in. Your parents can't come today? - No, I came by bus. - Okay. And also, Celeste wanted me to meet you. It's very nice to meet you, Juanse. Nice to meet you, Celeste's dad. - Did you tell your parents? - Yes. - Fine. - Come on, Dad. Let's go. Bye, Juanse. Zacarías, Zenón, Zeus, Zo... Zoilo? - Zoilo. - Zoilo. - You don't like any of... - No. They are old and kind of boring. Very boring. Besides, this list is missing one name with Z. - Which one? - Zorro. Zorro isn't a name, it's an animal in Spanish. - Yes, it is! It's a name. - No! Yes, it is a name. Once, Dad showed me the Zorro from TV. Well, but that Zorro has a real name, I think. - Dad! - What? - What's the name of the Zorro from TV? - Don Diego de la Vega. You were right. But still, zorro is fox in Spanish. - You were right. - Javi, can you pass me that coat? I love fox fur coats. I'll show you. Are there fox fur coats? Thank you! - Look at this. - It's so nice! It's very soft. Yes. - Red fox fur coat. - Where is it from? From the north of Africa, from a country called Morocco. Wow. What are you two up to? Nothing. Shall we tell him? We will go together on an expedition to Morocco, - and we will rent a motorhome. - What? But you won't go because you're not a girl. You're so mean. - Okay, get ready, we have to go. - Why now? Fine, I'm coming. When my brother is born, will you come visit him? - Of course. Do you want me to come? - Yes. Then I'll come. And will you go to Mom's house? Yes. You have to call me and I'll go. We could have tea together or do whatever you want. - Is that okay? - Great. Honey. Show me those teeth. - Will it take long? - I don't think so. It will take three more visits to your granny. Celeste, come give Grandpa a kiss. We have to go. Dad... I want to go to sleep. Do you want to go to bed? Go, honey. Dad! Dad! Dad, come here! What is it? I want to go home. But you are home. Home with Mom. Why? What happened? I want to sleep in my room. But you have your room here. I'll take you there. No. I want to go to Mom. Are you sure? Yes. But we'll wake her up this late. Do you want to wake her up? Your mom is pregnant. She has to rest. - Try to sleep here. - I can't. - I'll get into bed with you. - No. Celeste, please. I'm afraid. Of what? My baby brother will come, and what if Mom... - What? - What if she doesn't love me anymore? Celeste, please. Don't be silly. Your mother will always love you. - But I want to be with Mom. - Your brother will also love you. I want to be with Mom. Okay, let's go. This is... Uruguay's national radio broadcast. All the voices. Bravo! Dad. Hello. - How are you? - Hello. Rodrigo. - Javier. I'm his son. - Nice to meet you. I'll be going. See you later, okay? - Goodbye. - Thank you. - Belmonte, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Hi, Belmonte. - How are you? - Have you met Javier, my youngest son? Nice to meet you. Hi, Javier. How are you? Fine. And? Are you working on an exhibition or something? Yes, he's preparing an exhibition at the visual arts museum of Parque Rodó. That's great! And are you working abroad? In the future, in Buenos Aires. It's all going great for you! Going? Going where? What does "going" mean? - Okay, let's go inside. - Come on. - Bye, see you later. - Goodbye. - Why do you talk about my stuff? - What did I say? - About the exhibition. - They will know anyways. It'll be in the newspapers. They'll read about it. Then let them buy the newspaper. Don't tell them. When Celeste does something that makes you proud, you'll tell everybody. No. - No, because I'm not a nosy old lady. - Neither am I. - You aren't? - I've known that woman since forever. - Yes, sure. - Of course. What are you doing here? My aunt forced me to come. And you'd rather be at home watching cartoons? No, I came because I like it. I play the piano. Okay. Okay, well... I'll go sit. What, you'll listen from here? It's the people, they distract me. No, I'm lying. I wanted to see you. Here I am. But I'll go sit. But I wanted to kidnap you. Another day, okay? Your perfume distracts me. - Okay. - I'm lying. I like it. Good luck, Belmonte. - Good luck, whatever your name is. - Mónica. See you later, Mónica. You won't meet anyone like this. I bet. I don't want to meet anyone. Why would I want that? I already know a lot of people. Don't you want us to introduce you to a friend of Magda? To whom? I don't want to be with anyone. What for? What do you mean, "What for"? Javi, don't you want to fall in love again? Fall in love? Marcelo, do you hear what you're saying? What are you talking about? Well... did you know Jeanne called me? What for? What did she say? Why did she call you? Did she talk about me? What did she say? Why did she call you? Why did you pick up? I'm fine. I don't want anyone meddling in my life. Who are you, the enemy? Okay, five minutes. Mrs. Eugenia, the taxi will be here in five minutes. Thank you very much. Goodbye, Eugenia Ruiz de Mendoza. Javi... What should we do about Dad? What should we do with what? If the guy comes here for him, Mom will know. You're meddling in Dad's life. You meddle in mine. Why don't you keep it to yourself? Why don't you stop meddling in everybody's life? - Hello? - Belmonte. Who? Belmonte! Rodolfo! Rodolfo! Rodolfo! - Javi. - How are you? - Fine. - Have you seen Jeanne down here? - Wait, I'll call her. - Thank you. Jeanne, it's from downstairs. Javi is here, he's looking for you. Yes. Is she coming down? She's coming. Thank you. Are you okay? Okay with what? No... Nothing. Everything. With what? The catalog will be ready soon. I'm not here for the catalog, I'm here to see my wife. - Jeanne. - She's coming. Thank you. What is it? - What are you doing here? - What is it with what? Why did you come here? To see you. - Javier, I'm working. - If I don't see you here, then where? Javier, what do you need? Celeste, the other night... - Did she say anything? - What about the other night? Nothing, I took her to your house crying. Javier, she missed her mom. She's a girl. That's what happened. Okay, I wanted to see you. Javier, I'm working. But are you okay? What is it? It's like an internal dialogue. Like two brothers fighting. I don't like it. - You don't like it? - No. Why? Because you're not that bad, Dad. That is an animal-person, right? Yes, it's a hybrid. What's a hybrid? It's a mixture of two different things. Why is he covering his face? Is he afraid? No, he's embarrassed. I want to put this one in the entrance hall. Dad... What? Why do you always draw naked men? Because I'm a man. But why are they naked? Look, this is one of our options. The text with the image. Okay? And this is another option with the same idea of... But with the text and the image superimposed. Is everything okay? Let me know before you go. I want to tell you something. Okay. We also have three options for the cover, with your signature on all three. Here. This might be the only acceptable one. It's all too saturated. And this detail, I don't know who picked it... And these texts that pretend to diagnose me, I want them as far as possible from the images, from my work. Thank you. It will be okay. It will be okay. Trust them. They are working well, they will print the catalog, it will help you sell... - Take advantage of it. - Who wants to sell more paintings? Javi... Javi, I need to count on you. What for? For these coming days. I need you to take care of Celeste, to be present. Can you do that? - Yes. - Will you be able to do that? Yes, of course. - Yes? - Yes. Okay. - And what, you'll let me know? - I'll call you. Okay. - Okay? - Yes. Good. Bye, Javi. - Talk to you later. - Yes. Belmonte. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? - Fine. And you? - And your aunt? My aunt? - They let you go out on your own? - Yes, today I had permission. - Really? - Yes. Are you a big girl? - Yes? - Yes. - Will you stay here? - I don't know. Do you want to go somewhere else? - Do you? - Yes. Are you sure? Okay, then. - Let's go. - Come on. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Yes? - Yes. Let's go. Wait. What else do you want, Belmonte? And where that smiley moon is, there would be a nude. What size would that nude be? Honestly, I don't remember. Small or big? Medium-sized, more or less like that painting. And there... there would be an impossible position. And there, there would be an animal-person. - A what? - An animal-person. - What are those? - They have four legs and... a human head... I don't know them. Dad! What? What are the animal-persons called? Hybrids. Yes, and there... It would be a hybrid... Another one on its side... - And then... - What size? I have no idea. Then, there would be a nude... - And... could you excuse me for a second? - Of course. Is something wrong? No. What are you thinking about? I don't know, nothing. Do you want to come help me? No, you continue. Are you mad at me? No, I'm not mad. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Mom. Mom. Is there anyone home? I've made up my mind. I want my brother to be named Eusebio. There's no one home. I left a message. They'll listen to it when they get back. - Cheese? - Yes. More? - Enough. - Okay. What, you don't want to compete? You're not up for it? No cheating. - No cheating. - Okay? Ready, go! I'm winning. I won. Ouch! Now finish it. Finish everything. Why did you choose Eusebio? I was thinking and... I think I dreamt something about Eusebio... And I thought about it. Hello? Dionisio. How are you? What? Oh, you are in the bedroom? How is Jeanne? The baby? Okay. Yes. Yes, she's picked a name. She wants him to be named Eusebio. - Yes. We'll go there. I'll take her. - Let's go. Easy. OPENING JAVIER BELMONTE THURSDAY, AUGUST 7, 7:00 P.M. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF VISUAL ARTS
