Together Biohazard Remediation. This is she. I'm so sorry to meet you like this. Yeah, we, we take care of all that for you. Mm-hmm. No, it'll all be different in a few hours. You'll get to come home and not see what happened. Okay, can I just get your name again? Yeah, I think we can do it in six. Hey, people need to live here, man. Okay, they can't do this themselves. - I didn't sign up for this shit. I clean normal shit, like dirt, debris, dog doo-doo. You got all the wrong D's in that motherfucker. Death, disaster, DNA, no, fuck that. I'll see you for dinner tomorrow. - Hello. - Hey, is this Clayton? - Yeah, who's this? - Julia, from Together Biohazard Remediation. You submitted your resume through our website. - Now you call me. - Look, I got four hours to wipe out what happened here. These people have a kid, and I know that this is super short notice, but I need a tech, like right now. Are you still there? Hello. - I can do that. - Oh, amazing, hey, do you have a HEPA filter? - Yeah, mine's in the shop. - Okay, just your PPE then. - PP, D. Got it. - Hey. Hey. Glad you came? Where's your PPE? - Oh, I just, I left in such a rush, I musta forgot it. - Someone just ran off with mine. All right, let me check the van. Here, you sign this. What's the matter? You sick? - I just have allergies. Am I allowed to ask what happened here? - The decedent stabbed her husband to death and then shot herself. So, what do you think? - I don't know. Relationships are hard. People can be animals, I guess. - But seriously, what's your plan here? - I'll make them disappear. With a scrubby and soap and detergent. - Okay, we have four hours. Don't forget, it's under here too. You're not some gore freak, are you? - You gotta be one yourself running a business like this. - I'm the boss, and I asked first. - Blood is blood. Doesn't matter to me. What matters is that I stop families from seeing it. You? - Gore freak. - Everything I do is guaranteed. I got one price, one price only. That includes disinfecting, cleaning, deodorizing. Whatever you need, I can do it. I'll even dispose of the waste. I see you got distracted, huh? I'm done in there. Do you need help with this? - Hey. - Whoa. - Look, I don't have to help. - It needs to break down first. Sorry, just don't, don't start without me. Fuck. - Oh, fuck. Hey. Before you start judging me, I need to share something with you, okay? I have this very bad addiction. It's like a curse, or a disease, or a cancer. - That's someone's existence you ate. - They're dead. It's not like I'm messing with someone's life. I saw what you did. Where's the real letter? Wait. No, no, no, don't do that, don't do that. Julia, please, please, please, please. Look, I know I'm not acting like myself, okay, but listen. Something strange is happening to me, and I'm really scared. And I need your help, you gotta believe me. Please. I'm sick, okay! And you were late responding to my resume. - Will you leave? For the family's sake, please, just take my bag, never contact me again. - Let me help you. I got this. You need me. - Hello. - Hi, Karen. - I'm sorry, I didn't realize you'd still be here. Is it safe to come in? - It is now. - Oh, I don't plan to stay. Olive, my granddaughter, she'll be staying with me now, and she says she needs her lamb to fall asleep tonight. Is it okay if I go to her room to get it? - Absolutely. - Of course you can. - Thank you. - If you're really serious about this, you should avoid eating food sprayed with chemicals. - Bless you. This is what she needs. - Thank you. - If you'll just please the leave the key in the mailbox when you leave. - Karen, I think you should have this. - Best of luck. - Look, I'm telling you the truth here. Okay, I don't know if it was a burner phone or a fake name or something, but the point is, he's out there. Holy shit. Hello. - I have our next job. Turn around. - Holy shit. Hey. - Is there anything in here? Please, I'm so hungry. I'm not gonna eat you. Please. I don't wanna be a stain for you to clean. - What the fuck? - People can be animals. - Mom? - Those were your father's last words. He lost control that night. - What are you talking about? Dad killed himself. Didn't he? - I, I needed to protect you. Feed him. - What? - Feed him. Don't do what I did. - Please, let me help you. - If you don't, it'll haunt you for the rest of your life. - Please. - Together Biohazard Remediation. This is she. I'm so sorry to meet you like this.
