"this is a Persian tale" that begins in the United States at a cabaret in Florida, in the middle of a tornado. What a tornado! "Engaged for next show, David Balkis... "in the Gay Paris Cabaret in Paris. "Triumphal reception" Paris! EMPIRE OF THE NIGHT A FILM BY PIERRE GRIMBLAT Just think, he's sending us his private plane, and we'll land on his property. Hello Paris! I'm very... -Did I hurt you? -No, no, no worries. Excuse me. Be careful. Say, I thought you had already brought him from Saint Helena. -Who is it? -It's the emperor of... Must you absolutely play that little tune? Absolutely. We played this when... -A big client, I understand. -No, not at all, he was the... What did Balkis say, in his telegram? -"Triumphal reception." -Yes, well... He had us arrive in Paris like a gas bill. Maybe he forgot. But even when one has the memory as small as that of an ant, one can't forget Eddie Parker. This Balkis is a... -True or false? -That's true. He may be the biggest boss of the cabarets of the world, but I'll grab him by the... I'll tell him... Right? Not fair play, Eddie, but you'll still have to tell him. -Yes. Do you have my poster? -Yes. Here. What a village! You have to get your Sunday coffin out to get three photographers, I'm going back to my mother's. Yes. Because Paris may not always be Paris. And if at home, General Motors decides to make Eiffel Towers, we'll all have one this year. Maybe the triumphal reception was waiting for us at Gay Paris. Not bad! Very intelligent. Forwards! The triumphal reception at the Gay Paris! Gay Paris! -Come one young man, we're awaited. -Yes, Eddie. Can you see something, Eddie? He's like the friend who traveled with us. Same overcoat. TO OUR RESPECTED BROTHER They tired a bit, but these are flowers from his country. The one-eyed man has only one eye, but he still cries. She's the wife of our well-loved wife, Gaspard. Let's go to David's study. The sooner we fix the present, the sooner we can cry the past. Non! This is the chair of our respected brother. I thank you for having come so quickly. We were looking forward to relieving you of a heavy weight, my dear sister. A scepter that just a human hand can... hold. Meaning? Our empire of the night, our revered brother built it cabaret after cabaret, theater after theater. He was a conqueror, but he was also a great lord, since he had insisted on keeping, as manager, the bosses of his former establishments. But his death will awaken dormant appetites. Talk about an apartment! -Did you see the tenant's name? -No. DAVID BALKIS EMPEROR OF THE NIGHT To start, we'll have to license all the numbers. The show formula is a prestigious formula. You must eat the cucumber when it's green, and the melon when it's yellow. -Alright, come. -Where? Eat a melon. But license them quickly. Let's not stay bent over the spring until its pure water becomes brackish by our tears. Amen. Hey, everyone. My condolences, Mrs. Balkis. Who are you? Eddie Parker! -Don't know him. -Doesn't know! One, two! Still don't know. We don't need anyone. We'll always need Eddie Parker. So there. What is it? A contract with your brother's autograph, at the bottom. I'm hired for six months. Well then... You're now unhired for an unlimited time. These aren't proceedings, Melchior. Thank you, ma'am. Because you're big, Mr. Balkis, I'll still leave you five seconds to pick all this up. I appreciate your generosity a lot. -Mr...? -Parker. If in five seconds you haven't picked this up, I believe it will take adding an extension to your brother's coffin. One... two... No! Melchior, you forget that we're in Paris. Calm yourself, dear sister. Balthazar! Gaspard's chain. When a dog helps you cross a river, don't ask about scabies. We'll continue our interview later. Here is 500 dollars. Tell this cowboy to go home. See you later, at the castle, for the funeral, my dear sister. He was, despite his power, the softest, the tenderest, most generous of men. All those delegated here know that well. The Gay Paris, the central thing in its cabarets is the night capital of the world. Each midnight, on the five continents, the tenants bow in the direction of Gay Paris. And if Lindbergh ventured over the Atlantic, we now know it by the little story, it was to pass a night at the Gay Paris. You, the musicians, you, the guards, you, the staff, you, the artists, you, the dedicated administrators of the establishments he had collected by way of persistence and patience, you knew his goodness. You knew his work. And the statistics proved it. Every three minutes, from the heart of cities, or at the far end of savannas, a pilgrim, I mean a tourist, sets off to come to the Gay Paris. How many weren't able to achieve their dreams? How many strayed on the way? And now the emperor is no longer here. But you don't remain alone with your child, Mrs. Balkis. Come from the Orient like kings magi whose names they bear, the brothers of the emperor are here, and well here. Courage. The world is quite empty now. Would you like to take our car, dear sister? I'd rather stay at the castle. All right, but go home slowly. See you later, at Gay Paris. I sympathize. Whoever takes steps that are too large won't reach the door. Do you need a locksmith? Why are you here? I needed to see you. You're not against it, I hope? What is it? Well, they ripped up my pretty contract, but I found the telegram announcing my engagement. Hold. My mother always told me that... My mother always told me... It's not very important. Be assured, your contract will be respected. Good. Give me the keys. What is there in this room? I don't know. We never lived here. My husband bought it for our son, for later. Ah well, for later... Well, I hope that your son will have many wives, a lot of children, and especially a lot of minions to take care of them. Back from America, my husband would come spend an hour or two here, in the afternoon. He'd lock himself in this room. No one was allowed to go in. Are you sure that your husband didn't have a big blue beard? It's appalling. Say, your husband didn't seem to carry me in his heart. -What was there between you two? -Nothing. I never knew him. Never. Say, has your husband been making a killing on my stage body? A few months ago. Well before I committed. He never spoke to you of me? No, never. I don't understand anything anymore. Were you happy with him? -He was a good husband. -I see. -Let's go. -Yes. This room gives me the blues. I really don't know why. If at least he had glued all these posters on the walls of Paris. Please, Mr. Parker, I don't want to joke. I'm not joking. I feel in the Middle Ages, bewitched by sorcerers. My husband was no kind of wizard. There's something in this story that I don't understand. Tell me, do I look a little like your husband's tax collector? In any case, the main thing is for us to agree. Alright? Your brothers-in-law didn't come from the East specially to express their condolences to you. How do you know? The speaker on stage was plugged in this morning. I heard everything. They want to take your son's inheritance. Let's imagine it. But how does that concern you? Well, I'll tell you. If they manage, my show is down and I don't want that. You have to trust Eddie Parker. It's so difficult to know who to trust. Where did you land? On an airfield. In this case, I think the best would be for you to live in the city of artists. The city of artists, what is that? A housing project that my husband created for artists working in his establishments. Well, your husband wasn't a bad horse. He was an extraordinary man, excessive in his generosity and in his hate. As said the other one this morning in his speech. About that, what is he selling, other than his word salad? -Mr. Krosse? -Krosse, yes. He was my husband's right arm. With such a right arm, I'd have gotten a left hook. Why do you say that? Because I have instinct. There is, in the city of artists, tons of very strange people. There you'll find the most beautiful collection of phenomena that you've ever seen. Is that right? I know all about bizarre phenomena. Greetings. Mr. Stravenusku! Hello. How is the doctor? I'll bring him to the vet. Youth is great. He came to the funeral, and relapsed. That's Doctor Mabuse doing as he pleases. Isn't that right, doctor? Mrs. Elsa, without bothering, may I ask you to lend me 5,000 francs? Your imprudence is costing us dearly, Doctor Mabuse. Thank you, my friends. What do we say, doctor, what do we say? Little jerk! -Does your name have a "k"? -Yes, my friends. Mr. Stravenusku, you've noticed? -What? -Look, I can do this. You're progressing with giant footsteps, Mr. Stroem. Not Stroem, Str?m. Seems the burial was beautiful. Very impressive, my dear, in the end. Such a man, I wonder what would have happened without him after my accident. Elsa, the alarm. The other. We have the Chinese. See you next year, Sir. Till next year, Ma'am. Hey, Lucien. Not Stroem, Str?m! No problem, until next year. See you next year. Next year. With Mr. Balkis's death, will there be a next one? See you next year. Until next year! -Hello, Victor! -Hello, Juliette! Hello, May-May! Hey, acrobats! -You weren't at the funeral? -No, I was at the studio. A man that you loved so! Alright, help me get father in. -Forward, everyone! -What did you film? The scenario was marvelous! A tall guy on a lounge chair, crying, and I say: "A simple application of capricious balm "and you're healed!" He has us apply some, throws the covers, and we sleep. Is it any good? The capricious balm? In the palm of your hand, a pinpoint of balm. Not more. Right away, you'll feel better. It's the suppleness of your 20 years, in your hand. A light massage, and the pain flies away. Thanks to the capricious balm, happiness appears. You're now like heroes of your dreams. Like them, you come in, and the stunned world asks: "Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?" Hey. Are you the boss of the motel? I'm come from Mrs. Balkis. We'll need two rooms with a view on the sea. Give them the Chinese's rooms. Did you have problems? A work accident. I threw myself well, but landed badly. Ludovic Str?m, the only acrobat to ever succeed the triple Nelson back, without help. It's an achievement. I thought the Rockefellers did it too. I said, without help. Without help. Under which name? Remind you of something? Here you go. Nice period furniture. On your contract, you can... Go, go get the rest of the bags. Come on, go! You have nice suitcases. I travel a lot, you know. -I come from very far. -You come from so far? Know Hollywood? As well as Hollywood knows me. Is it nice? More than nice, it's... -It's Hollywood. -Yes, that's it. That's right. Paris isn't bad either. You know, Irma read in the coffee grounds that I'd love an American. Really? She told you that? That's marvelous. My friends! My good friends, listen up! As a tribute to the memory of our venerated emperor, all the Balkis establishments will take a break tonight. Now, we'll have to grease our elbows, because despite the death of the emperor, life goes on, alas. Thus, you have seen it, the Chinese went away, the Russian came. It's the nature of things. Things being what they are, and the era as it is, Balkis Brothers, Sirs, I say it in black and white, it's been decided to validate your contracts, until the end of the month. I'll explain, doctor. My friends, be calm, please, let me be calm. -Did he look after Balkis's affairs? -Yes. So I'll have to interview him. By the way, Gentlemen here are the Balkis Brothers. Slowly, slowly! Yes, go ahead, it'll get through! It'll get through easily! Go ahead! Go ahead! Damn...damn... You have comprehensive cover, right? It's our car, Gaspard. Say, fat guy, your thing here, is that to tame fleas, or to fish your casts? OK, put your workshop in the pocket. I'm coming. Don't go. Would you hold this two minutes? It's time for my personal fitness. So, what were we saying? Little, little one. Well done! Well done! Well done! Well done! Your intellectual forgot his pen. At home, we turn the key. It's old-fashioned, but it'll work. Second omission: you were going to leave without me. You have everything you need to console yourself in the catalogue. Here, here is your hat. Do you hold it against my friends for being so pretty? I don't share your tastes. If you could share theirs, it wouldn't be too bad. Nor have I your taste in sharing. I understand. At your age, I was like you. Anyone there? May I get in? Go ahead. I'm exhausted. The other mosquito bit me. Come on... A little smile! Come on. Thanks to the pill things, you can see life in pink. -You remind me of someone. -Who? My photographer. I'll see him now. Could you drop me off at Krosse's? An appointment? He's the one who has one with me, but doesn't know it yet. It'll be his party. Start it up! You have your driving license, on one condition: show me Paris. The Sacr?-C?ur, coquettishly planted on the Montmartre hill since 1886, -constructed by architect... -Fine, fine. Next. The Arc de Triomphe, 50m high by 45 wide. To the right, Rude's famous La Marseillaise. Notice... Say, what is that little thing, in the sky? Lower your eyes a little, it's the Eiffel Tower, constructed by 300 acrobats. My word, it looks like it's... Of course. We also have our Statue of Liberty. She's smaller. Last stop! Mr. Krosse's place, your future friend. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. What do you want with Mr. Krosse? Do you have a meeting? How's it going at home? Is your wife still in love with the neighbor downstairs? Mr. Krosse only receives on appointment! Bring her to the movies, it'll change her ideas. I bet we're here for the same reason. Do you sometimes knock, Mr. Parker? Yes. I spoke to Mr. Krosse about the billiard room. Extravagant! I admit that I don't understand this story. Who decided to hire me? Mr. Balkis. And in my soul and consciousness I had formally advised him to do it, in black and white. Why so? For a thousand reasons, Mrs. Balkis, one of which at least is good: this guy is totally finished. You mustn't say it, Mr. Krosse. Oh, no? No, for a thousand reasons, one of which at least is good: with this thing, I can make you spit your 32 teeth out, whether they are original or second-hand. Menaces? Mister, please. You haven't produced for four years, in New York. Can't be everywhere at once. But the bother is that you weren't elsewhere either. Barely arrived, to be chased out, as you didn't stop seducing the wife or girlfriends of the director. That proves that I'm pleasing. You, you can't understand that. Insinuation in front of a witness. Continue, my boy, continue, continue. Mrs. Balkis, would you close your eyes, please? I think that you had better start your rehearsals, Eddie. Close your eyes please, Mrs. Balkis. And now plug your ears. Can you hear me? No, she can't hear anymore, she can't see. There's no more witness, I'll continue. Parker... Mr. Krosse, you are awful. Things you say can't be said in front of a woman. Parker... There are old slippers in a trash can more appealing than you. Could you write that in black and white? Enough. Blows... and... injuries. Taxi! OK, Paris, don't let yourself be intimidated by your meter, it's urgent. Attention! Zero, one, two, three, four and five, six, seven and eight and one, two, three, four, five, six and eight! And eight and one, two, three and four and five, six, seven and eight! And one, two, three and four and five, six and seven and eight and one, two, three and four and five, six, seven and eight! And one, two, three! Who are those clients? Balkis establishment managers. There's a conference. And eight! And eight and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight! And one, two, three, four, five... FRENCH GAS Hey, Sir! Hey! You must have taken the wrong path. Hey! Hey, can you hear me? Driver! Driver! Suppleness! Be supple! When Eddie Parker sees this... You talk a lot about your Eddie Parker, but when will we see him reappear? The emperor was on time. Indeed, I appreciated his accuracy a lot. He was on time, alright, but to dictate his wishes to us. His four wills. Maybe things will change? They had better, guys! He was nice with us, like with dogs, he was! Good mash, but to the kennel. We get flab and ankylosis. We can work our deltoids, but doesn't hold a candle to life before. Each labored for his apple. We'd pig out, some would even pig out a lot. Are you sending steam my way? I'll send it where I want! Don't talk about kicking, will you? It puts ants in my slats. Come, men, we didn't come here looking for skates! Is that to put drops in your nose? I prefer prevention. I have people outside, in case I take too long to go out. Not just you took precautions. You're surely not the only one; I don't know what's going on, the street is full of ugly villains! These gentlemen! It's fine, it's not heavy! He who hits the powerful has snakes come out. Good evening. A pleasure. Hello. Gentlemen, I know your problem. I took the liberty of uniting you for each one to discuss freely. -But us... -But, but, but! Your brother directed his empire with a totalitarianism that didn't fit with our era. -Indeed, and... -that according to me, Please! We plan to make of the empire of the night a democracy by giving managers of our cabarets their autonomy back. -Bravo! -Silence! This, inside a federation that my brothers and I will take the lead of. If you are a friend of the captain, you can wipe your hands off on the sails. -Alright! -Alright! No! Not alright! Dear Melchior, you are very careless with things that aren't yours. The emperor is dead. But he has a son. And the son of a dead emperor is another emperor, Melchior. This emperor, my dear sister, is just old enough to sit on a chamber pot, not to sit on a throne. Ma'am! Ma'am, the child! -What, "the child"? -The child disappeared. Sir, when is tea served at the castle? No kidding! You're Eddie Parker? You had a lot of success with the ladies. You ran after castle life for a long time. Now you have it. Are you happy? Come now, don't look so stuck. Thanks, old man. It was a simple rehearsal. Well. And when will the gala be held? In ten minutes the alarm will ring. So more bullets will be fired, and this time, they'll be fired at you. Thank these men, Mr. Balkis, not for the bullets, for the 10 minutes. Use them to meditate on your life. On your death. He was playing in the nursery, ma'am, like a little angel. I heard a noise, I hurried. The window was wide open! The child! We have to warn the police! If you can't care for children, care for their mother. I'm going, sir. No screams, no phoning. Tears... are the best relief. Poor child, young and absent. His reign begins badly. I just learned, Mrs. Balkis. We are in a very confused situation, Mrs. Balkis. That can clear up. You're the ones who kidnapped him, aren't you? It's you! Who says I'm not allowed? Allowed? My child! Would you like to read this, Krosse? It's the emperor's writing. -Indeed, and it's from two years ago. -Yes. Yes, yes. "Recent events opened my eyes about my wife..." How? "...at my death, my son must be entrusted to my brothers "in view of preparing him to ascend to the throne. David Balkis." David never wrote that. Yet it is there, look. It's there, black on white, it's... The managers have already asked to get in contact with us. Look at them. Sharks, octopuses, the jellyfish. Coming up from the bottom of the sea where David relegated them. They smell the good smell of blood and power. Could you stand up to them? Yes, the underworld is stirring, my dear sister. Each sees himself succeeding the emperor. Stir up the mud, water becomes cloudy. Give me my child back. It'd go against our revered brother's will. Give and take, we'll give you the child but we'll care for his interests. Watchful faces don't they control your conduct? If I may offer some advice, Mrs. Balkis, I think that indeed... -Fine. -Maybe we should put it in black and white, it's... Rule of thumb. Write, Krosse. David, I feel alone. I the undersigned Genevi?ve Balkis... Do you mind? I don't like fish. We have nothing to hide from our allies. So, speak to me about the castle party. Write! What's going on? Writing your memoirs? They have my son. "...I entrust to Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard Balkis "the care of managing all establishments "of Patrick Balkis, heir." You have to add something else. If by misfortune, Patrick Balkis passes... God will protect him! Of course, Ma'am, only... We must do something. Ma'am! You're crazy, they have my son! But I have you now. We can now speak with them. Oh no, the boss lady! He's starting again! Eddie! Sailing! I said: sailing! Alright, more sailing! We'll start with a few rounds. Mirka, point your feet! Point them! Are you going pull a long face? Careful, Mirka. Hard in the hands! Hard! Pull a long face, old man, a long face! Without my face I wouldn't have gotten here. Alright, get yourselves down. Supple. Supple! Not bad. Alright, let's start over while I'm still warm. An intermission, please. Eddie! I have two words to say to you all. You know, the delicious Balkis Brothers want to steal the empire, so they kidnapped the kid. And to give him back, they asked the mother to sign an act relinquishing all the cabarets. The wretches did that? She signed? No, she didn't have the time. -What have you done? -I kidnapped her. I'll bring her here. Believe me, it's better for you. Well, I'll take her elsewhere. Not at all, not at all! Her husband created this city and she'll be denied asylum? Lowlifes! Wretches! Scoundrels! Poor souls! Cowards! Gypsies! Hold me back, Elsa! Hold me! You're holding me? Really something, isn't it? Just decide quickly, because it won't be long before they arrive. Ma'am Balkis, please. -Alright, quickly! -We haven't seen her. Listen well, all of you. Kidnapping is a crime! Being an accessory to kidnapping too. And these crimes are severely punished by the law. By these Balkis gentlemen. We know she is here. We've been warned. Well, I will refer to these... gentlemen. That's it, they're here! Where is Mrs. Balkis? I've just found a great hiding spot for Genevi?ve but with her city clothes, it won't do at all. -What's happening to her? -Concussion. It's crazy how well black suits you. Alright! Contrary to what was said, the Balkis establishments will open tonight! At the call of their name, the artists must present themselves immediately! The Telbergs! The Sivanovs! The Motel Brothers! Soon it'll just be us in the complex. You'll hide me here? Better: You'll disappear in the magic cupboard. Enter. -Eddie... -We can do it all at the music hall. Don't be scared, I'll come get you out. Disappearance! -Can you hear me? -Yes. Well, see you later. I'll give your charming brothers-in-law tea on a big tray. See you later, Eddie. Mrs. Algaz! Alright! Gentlemen, search the room. Excuse me! You don't see it on the shelf, ask for it inside. You're the one scaring them, Mr. Balkis. You look too much like a big cat. Tell us where you hid her. The fox knows a lot, but the one who catches it knows more. I think that we shouldn't have freed our younger brother. Don't be scared, I would just like to speak to you. You are not like the others. What is your name? Help! What is your name? You learned how to play piano, Mr. Marco! Yes, and the accounting. And tarot. And throw-fishing. And hockey on grass. In total, instead of a raise, I stayed manager like the others. And yet! Sir! If I give you a way of winning 100,000 dollars, you'd let me go? A hundred thousand dollars? This guy is crazy. You can talk, rabbit. These are things that had better be said in your ear. Don't come closer, otherwise... Gaspard! -You're here, Mrs. Balkis? -Yes! I wouldn't want you to take my question badly but the 5,000 francs, did you give them? -That I did! -It's strange, I can't find them. Try as I may, all my pockets... Yet I have a sense of order. Nothing here either. Maybe here. Sadly, no. Dear ma'am, I... Doctor Mabuse, you will be fined! Professor, would you show me how the magic cupboard works? The magicians union is formal, the secrets must be kept. We're sworn. -So do the trick for me. -No way. I already did my number tonight, at the Circ?. Small crowd of connoisseurs. Triumphal. Obviously, you don't have your stage. Excuse me, young man? Fine, come. If you're interested, ma'am... Disappearance! And now, you have the right to doubt your senses. Appearance! Are they gone? -A real court! -It is one. And it'll condemn you to death. Right, general counsel? Exactly. The ripe fruit falls on its own. The floor goes to the defense. I pass. If someone doesn't agree, raise your hand. Please, your honor? You gave the verdict before even reading the charge sheet. It's so brief. Meddling with what wasn't his business, is that enough? I'd be difficult. Do you care for life, Mr. Parker? As much as me. So have mercy on Mrs. Balkis. It's not in my prices. Life is too short for me to be a brute. Keep your head. Better than keeping his hat. When we see yours, we don't think this. Still no news? No. Looks like you blame me. He'd not be in this story -if you hadn't turned his head... -What? Exactly what I'm wondering. So you don't think he is capable of unselfish generosity?? -You're in love with him. -Me? Don't deny it. And you, maybe? -You forget... -Who you are? What happened. With a husband the age of your grandpa, widowhood mustn't be much harder than marriage. Jealousy is beautiful. It's hot, it's alive. No, I wasn't thinking of my husband. I was thinking of my son. We just called, they're all at Gay Paris, it's bad for Eddie. Gentlemen, no questions? Is there anyone whose abilities could apply in the present case? Why not you, my dear? It seems to me that you have a criminal record that can't take any more. Yours isn't exactly new either. I think I remember that my cousin Castellani did not die of measles. Hints, Paulo, I'm rather against them! No need to search, gentlemen, the deal is settled. This is our father's knife, Gaspard. Don't bother, Figaro, I shave with an electric razor. Speed it up and I'll put his tonsils in the shop. -Where is the little Balkis? -No! Speak. He's at Krosse's. Don't tell Balthazar I told you. Quickly, I have my car. No, it's not fast enough. We'll take this. Be careful! DEATH OF THE EMPEROR OF THE NIGHT I'm tired of being followed. I'll show you how to get rid of a follower or followers. It can always serve. First of all, a boot kick. Not so elegant, but, as you see, very efficient. Then... Yes, a hip turn. Always, always efficient. A kick. It hurts. A throw over the shoulder. Well done, Eddie! -You're marvelous. -Thank you. It's the least of things. It got me in shape. Quick, we're going to Krosse's. You want to go there? It's where they hid the kid. Ah yes, your famous Don Quixote night mission. I've had enough of the night. A country for the blind. I'm lucky. They have the little one, but I have Mrs. Balkis. We each have half of the ticket. What are you hoping? Once out of trouble, the Empress will make you manager? Paris is my last chance, Juliette. -Your last chance? -Yes. If I miss my chance, well, on posters, my name will be smaller than the printer's. -You understand? -Eddie... Disappointed to not have Constantine? I'm just Eddie Parker. I'd like to show you the day. -I bet that you've never seen him. -Never, my love. Said to 12,000 women. To many more, but in English. I think that there's not much hope now. With Eddie, there always is. Juliette, our poor little Juliette! Stop that, it's echoing in here. Mrs. Balkis, I've done great things. They've always turned against me. The triple Nelson first, it busted my kidneys. Then Juliette. She breaks my heart. I'm plaster. -Don't say that! -Shut up. A block of plaster that you covered with graffiti like on a urinal. Genevi?ve, I think I know where the kid is. Come in, my friends. We need you here. Excuse me, the cleaning has not yet been done. My son! We were just going to ask for news from Mr. Parker. And it's we who bring it to you. Listen to that! Look, my billiard partners. What is it? These are your brother's secret bodyguards. To you, to you, to you, to you! And to our most respected Sovereign, we come to say this: You will have to find yourself at dawn in front of the tomb of our revered master. The child will be returned to its mom. And David's last wishes will be made known. But... he's not dead, then? He's testing us? Any fighting must cease from here on in. They are now useless. At dawn. At dawn. I'm listening to you. David! You're not dead? No, not yet, Krosse. Hello, my dear! Are you OK? You're not hurt? I want my son to learn how to read in what will be written. The emperor of Paris cabarets learned one day that he'd die. Doctors say I just have one month left. Secretly he warned his faithful advisor. Isn't that right, Krosse? The confidant immediately tells the brothers who run the Orient cabarets. Scheming, conspiracy, fake reports! You took advantage my wife's trip in America to make me think that she had been unfaithful, and granted favors to a facilitator of journals of dubious reputation. Wretch! The emperor's suffering was without limit. Hours... Hours of cultivating my hate on the image of this man. So David Balkis, whose end is close, hired the fake lover. He announced his death -and lived. -I saw... the greed of my brothers, the cowardice of my managers, the betrayal of my confidant. But I also saw your loyalty, my beloved wife. And I discovered the loyalty of this man that we used, and that I nearly had killed. I said no! You call me the emperor, well, emperors have the right to choose their deaths. I'm going to leave. Melchior, swear you'll never kill my child. Swear it to me. He refused to get healed. He's gone forever after having had his brothers swear loyalty to him. He should have brought them. I knew he was watching you. I recognized him in the castle staircase. Don't cry, Mrs. Balkis. I was sure he'd come back one last time to say goodbye to you. -My boy! -This time I'll bring him back. Come, my little prince. You know, little one, we're not out of the woods, you and I. There are still two uncles left. When the emperor asked me to not touch the child, I was empty handed. But for the mother and Parker, I had my glove. Now, I swear that their opening show will go down in history. And I, I swear that whatever happens, my show will continue. I took precautions. Who doesn't have armor? Miss. Who doesn't have their armor? May everything go well! With Eddie, you can feel at ease. You dislocated your knee, my brother, while playing his golf? Exactly, my dear. Look at this swelling. You're right to wear an orthopedic splint. I myself don't feel very well. I'm coming down with a terrible bit of heart disease. Keep going, keep going! Stall them, I have a score to settle. Now, that's boxing! Good evening, Mr. Balkis. So were you hurt? Does your back hurt? Very well, very well, very well. And can you feel your legs? No. Very well, very well. And your head, can you still shake your head? -No. -Sensational. Just like me. That's great, isn't it! Hands up, come on! Come on! Quickly, quickly! Come, let's clear the area. Ladies and gentlemen, let us explain: They want to take the bread from our mouths. We don't have security. Careful, gateway 3! Careful, careful, bearing 8! Careful with the garden. Beware of the bottles! Look, guys! I can do this now! Go. I also know pretty proverbs. Never four without five. You were singing, I'm very happy about it. Well, you can dance now. Might isn't always right. "La Fontaine." Mr. Parker has a kind of talent. This talent, you're thinking of our 5,000 francs? My dear, see here, I wouldn't want to disappear before having... Professor! Professor! Well, where is he? Professor! Remember this, because tomorrow it'll have to be redone perfectly. Noted? It's noted. With this show, you'll be sold out for two years. Do you hear that? Paris has made your happiness, Eddie! I'm leaving it with a heavy heart. -You're leaving us? -Yes. Yes, they want me elsewhere. I don't know who, or know where, but I must go. With me! Better not. Both of us aren't your age. And who will help me run the business? Mr. Krosse is here. -Right, Mr. Krosse? -I'm all for Mrs. Balkis. Mr. Krosse will advise you. Isn't that right, -Mr. Krosse? -With joy. He'll look over your business. -Isn't that right, Mr. Krosse? -Yes. Because Mr. Krosse knows well that my shoe will never be more than an hour's flight from his behind. -Right, Mr. Krosse? -Yes, yes. That's obvious. Good. Well, see you in two years, my lovelies. -In two years? -In two years. Eddie! And what if I should need you? You read the newspapers. Anywhere I go, -noise will spread. -More than that! One, two! I had told you all that, -he was an idiot... -Yes, Eddie, you told me. THE END Alexandra Joslyn Subtitling: Hiventy
