I am Folsom Prison. At one time they called me Bloody Folsom. And I earned the name. I've been standing here, in California, since 1878. My own prisoners built me. Shutting themselves off from the free world. Every block of my granite is cemented by their tears their pain, and the blood of many men. This is a story from my rough, tough past. It happened not long after the turn of the century. At the time I tell about, I had within my walls a thousand dangerous men that other prisons couldn't hold. But, I held them. If I couldn't break a man's spirit I broke his bones. I kept many of them in a cell house that wasn't fit for animals, let alone men. It's cells were more like tombs and the doors were made of solid iron. Secured by bars that only dynamite could budge. Two men, and often more were crowded into those airless crypts. They slept when they could sleep on mattresses alive with vermin. They froze on winter nights and their bodies were drainedof sweat in the breathless heat of summer. Every morning, while it was still dark my guards made the rounds turning out the inmate kitchen workers so they could cook the slop that was fed my prisoners under the name of breakfast. Is it any wonder that after a sleepless night a man sometimes went berserk and fought the hated walls that shut him in? Knock it off, you! Let a guy get some sleep! Pipe down, you wing ding! This was a common thing in those old days. I had so little work for them to do. Idleness and brutal restrain is a combination that rots a man's mind. Every Sunday morning a long line of prisoners waited before the gate which led to the office of the Captain of the Guard. These men had dared to break my rules rules no man could keep under such conditions. And they were there to be sentenced to punishment. First in line was the man whose mind had cracked under the awful strain. His feet were touching the dead line and every prisoner knew that it meant just that. That the convict who stepped across that line without being ordered to do so, invited hot lead from the riffles of the guards in the towers. Trigger happy morons who needed no second invitation. In every prison population there is always a leader. And Chuck Daniels, doing a life term, was just that. My warden at that time was of the old school. In the language of the prison world, a con hater. To him convicts were brutes. And brute force was the only thing that would keep them in line. Pete Donovan. - Pete Donovan! Close the gate. Pete... I see you had a little trouble this morning? What have you got to say for yourself? Nothing. Destroying prison property is a serious offence. Haven't you got any explanation to offer? You try sleeping in one of them sweat boxes. According to regulations, I should put you in solitary. Go ahead. Drop 30 days on me. A concrete bed will be better than that stinking mattress, I've been sleeping on. Ten days solitary. - Wait a minute. He can do 10 days standing on his head. Getting temperamental again, eh? Mark him down for 30. 'It'll take that long to cool off a big boy like Pete.' Get him out of here. Chick Fullis. I think 10 days is enough, Warden. Ten days? What do you think we're running here? A flop house for these guys? Fullis, why'd you start a fight with Maticy in the yard? I didn't start anything. - The report say-- The report's all wrong, Captain. What about it, Sergeant? All I know is Maticy's in the hospital. Somebody gave him a pretty good workin' over. Maticy says it was Fullis. Any witnesses? - None that would talk. It wasn't me. You think I'm stupid? I just did 30 in the hole. I don't wanna go back. That's the trouble with this joint. You blink an eye, the roof falls in on you. Wait a minute. Who are you yelling at, con? Give him another 30. That'll teach him some manners. Get out of here. Drop out of line. - What's wrong, Chuck? I'll tell you later. Go to the other end of the yard, wait for me. See you over there. The students are sure nervous this morning. Yeah. Don't try it, Jeff. Call it off. Why? - It looks bad. Why is Rickey standing up there watching us? And look at them bulls in 16. I got to hunch, somebody tipped 'em off. Give it up, Jeff. - It's too late now. You won't get another chance. I'm going. - Well, not me. Take my advice, Jeff. Call it off. Anything wrong? No. Give the signal when I go through the gate. Jeff Riordan. - 'Riordan!' Shut that gate! They've made a break to the Captain's office. Open the gate, Joe. Get outside that gate or we'll kill these guys. Get away from that gate, we're coming through. Go ahead, fire! 'Fire, I tell you! Fire!' Fire! Come on, get in there! 'Hold your fire. Hold your fire!' 'Hold your fire! Quite, you fellas. Everybody back! You two are responsible for this. I'll take care of you personally. Alright. Okay, boys. The game's over. What's the score? Three dead. Four, maybe five. I had a bid to that party. - Yeah, so did I. I passed it up. When I go, I go alone. How're you going, boy? Oh, you'll find out. After I've gone. Doc Hayden just phoned. Captain Baxter died during the night. Two officers dead. Lax discipline is the answer. If Baxter hadn't been so soft, he'd be alive today. So, we're clamping down the lid. As of now, all privileges are cancelled. The men not assigned a job will be locked in their cells 24 hours a day. Stop the tobacco issue. Lights out in the cells the minute the men get back from supper. Sherman, tell the mess sergeant to cut the con's meals to the bone. No meat, no sugar. Beans, three times a day. And close the canteen till further orders. Sergeant, you're acting Captain of the Guard. I'll recommend you to the board, make your promotion permanent. Thank you very much, sir. I want you to take the men who instigated this riot. They've about three weeks before they come to trial. And give 'em six hours a day on the hooks. Right. Now... I'll talk to Jeff Riordan. Take the cuffs off him. Go ahead. Jeff, isn't dangerous. Not now. Wait outside. Jeff, you're a bigger fool than I thought you were. Nobody ever escapes what they've done. Nobody. Six of you got through the gate. There were others who couldn't make it. Others who were all set to go. Who were they? Didn't your stool pigeon tell you that? Oh, he told us there was a break coming. But, he couldn't tell us when or who would be in on it. I'll make a deal with you. The name of the stool pigeon for the names of those who missed out. I know the name of the stool pigeon. Look, you are no hoodlum like the others. Why protect? Officers have been killed. That means a death sentence. I can get you a commutation. Yunoski was in on it, wasn't he? 'Daly? Tinker?' Pardue? Daniels? You're not even warm, Warden. Not Daniels? Your good friend. You wouldn't go without him. He didn't know anything about it. Neither did the others. You're wasting my time and your life, Jeff. Now, you know you're going to tell me. Sit down. Don't you know hospitality when you sit? That was a mistake, Jeff. Now, we're really going to have a good time. Not Daniels? - Not Daniels. Two. Two. Three. Five. 'Three.' 'Two.' Two. Got it from an orderly in the hospital. He got it from a guy who works in administration. Jeff, wouldn't talk. No matter what they did to him. Chuck thinks somebody tipped the warden out about the break. That's what it looks like. - Yeah, but who? That's one thing that can't be covered up. The name of the stool pigeon. Somebody knows who he is and somebody will find out. Yeah, that'll be the end of him. The end of him? Yeah. But not the end of Rickey. Turning men against each other tormenting them till they fight back and get shot down. We'll have him in our necks till we get out. Get me? Out. I told you guys not to smoke in here. You know what we got stashed in this cell. Wanna be carried out of here in a basket? Good morning. Good morning. What can I do for you? I'm Frazier, Sacramento Press. I want to see the warden. Well, he hasn't come back from lunch. His house is across the street. Why don't you step over, send your name in? Yeah, thanks. I will. Take this man over to the warden's house. Thank you. Warden Rickey? - Yes. I'm Frazier, Jim Frazier. Sacramento Press. Well? I'd-I'd like a few minutes of your time, Warden. What for? Well, it's been reported to my paper that one of your inmates were so badly beaten by-by a prison officer that he is now paralyzed. Anything in it? - No. I have to have more proof than that to kill this story. In other words, you don't believe me. That's about it. Alright, Mr. Frazier, come with me. Get in. Why do they have to search yourcar? How do we know when somebody's stashed a gun under the hood? You better shake this guy down, too. He's a newspaper man. Yeah, I might have a typewriter taped to my skin. 'Okay.' After you, Mr. Frazier. - Thank you. What's the name of man you had the report on? Riordan, Jeff Riordan. Number 16. Just a moment. What is this? Those are the men who started that riot a few weeks ago. 'How long have they been getting this treatment?' Oh, about two weeks, I guess. Riordan's in here. Riordan, move your leg. See? He's not paralyzed. 'Leave him alone.' What did he do? - He was top man in the riot. Don't you think he ought to be in the hospital? Perhaps you're right. You should report Riordan's condition to the Captain's office. Phone the hospital and have them send a stretcher down right away. Any other suggestions, Mr. Frazier? 'We have to get down here' and show ourselves to the gate guard. What for? So that he can see that there's nobody in the car holding a gun on us. We lost a warden that way, once. A good warden? - Not bad, as wardens go. It's only fair to warn you that the story I'm gonna write will tell just exactly what I saw here today. Go ahead, write it. But write this, too. Those men murdered Captain Baxter and a guard. They tried to use Sergeant Hart and me as hostages. And if they'd got away with it, we would've had our throats cut. What would you do in a case like that? Put him in the bridal suite and give him breakfast in bed? Okay. Drop in again, Mr. Frazier. anytime. Thanks. Maybe I will. What do you want? Mr. Rickey, sir, the word's out, I tipped you off about.. You know. - Uh-huh. You gotta help me. Get me away from the yard. You'll be alright. We'll protect you. I don't think you can. They'll kill me, Warden. They'll kill me! Alright, if it worries you that much I'll have you transferred to the ranch. Thank you, sir. Shall I have him transferred right away, Warden? No. Forget about it. Leave him where he is. Hello. - Hello. I'll be glad to give you a lift, if you're going my way. Well, I-- - Now don't misunderstand me. I mean a lift. It's awfully nice of you, but... I'm going to the prison. Well, so am I. Come on, get in. My husband's in Folsom. - Oh? What does he do? He works in the quarry. He's a convict. Oh, I see. What's his name? - Red Pardue. He's getting out soon. - Well, that's good news. Oh, it is for me. It's tough going bringing up a couple of kids without a father. Two kids? You? - Mmm-hmm. A boy and a girl. You got children? - Uh-uh. You should have. - Oh, I gotta get a wife first. That would be better. They're such fun. What, wives? - No, kids. Well, here we are. Have a nice visit. - We will. Thanks for the ride. Every time I come up here to see him they tell me they've got him in the hole. But if he's in the hole, how'd you get in here? Just as to see somebody else. I've got lots of friends livin' in this place. I'm crazy about you, kid. - I'm the same way about you. You're not gonna ditch me? - Never. If I could only-- - Hey. What's going on here? Have a heart will you? We're on our honeymoon. Don't wear what you're wearing now. Get something simple, you understand? Okay, Chuck. Tell the people you rent from that your husband's in the hospital. Lung trouble or something. And you need a place for him to get well in. But Placerville was close to Folsom. Don't be stupid, that's just the first stop. I'll tell you what, Molly. - Yes, Joe? Send me some yarn. I learning how to knit. 'The way things happened, Janie' There I was, all set to go with that mob. I told you it was crazy. Couple of weeks later I get a letter from the board telling me they've granted my parole. You could be dead now. You should thank God on your knees. I did. Just think Janie. Six more months and I'll be coming home. I haven't been able to think of anything else since I got your letter. You told the kids? - Of course. Jinny is too young to understand. She hardly knows me. - But the boy.. What did he say? Oh, what all kids say when they're glad. He ain't ashamed I'm a con? - He boasts about it, Red. Oh, no. Look, that's bad. - I know. You say, he's crazy about football? Okay, you tell him life's just like that. That you can't play the game without the rules. And if you break the rules, you gotta pay the penalty. Tell him, a thief's not only a snide player. but he's a chump who gets at the neck every time. And tell him... I love him. I love them both. Well, I see you've heard the bad news. Yeah, hear some guy's moving into the Baxter's quarters. They also tell me he's gonna be the new Captain of the Guard. That's right. - Well, what happens to me? What about my promotion? Well, I thought I could get the board to leave things as they are. Put the new man in your old spot. I even talked to them on the phone. No does. I know how you feel, Cliff. But I'm not happy either. After all the years I've put in here. It makes me feel like a sap. I know. I know. But listen to what the board wrote to me. Get this. "You've been working too hard, Ben and you're tired. "Your staff has let you down. "What you need in Folsom is a transfusion. "New blood, young blood. "So, we're sending Mark Benson as your new Captain of the Guard." New blood! Young blood! What do they think I am? Old? Mark Benson. Didn't he used to work at Quentin? Yeah, he was a sergeant. University guy. They made him superintendent of the road camps. I met him a couple of times. Heard him sound off once at a meeting of the Prison Association. Cons are mentally sick. Early influences, society's to blame. You know, that line. - Yeah, I know. What are we supposed to do? Give him a shove in the arm? You know what he wants to use on cons? No, what? - Psychology. No kidding! - Fact. You know what that is? Well, it's uh-- - Here. "The science which treats of the mind of men "and any of its aspects. "Systematic knowledge and investigation of the phenomena of consciousness and behavior." Well, he better not try that stuff in here. Oh, I want him to try. I'm gonna give him all the rope he needs and then watch him hang himself. Yeah? Mr. Benson is here, Warden. Oh, come in. come in. Hi, Mark. Welcome to Folsom. - Thank you, Warden. It's gonna be a pleasure to work with you. You've met Captain.. Uh, Sergeant Hart? No, I haven't. But I've heard about him. I'm gonna need a lot of help from you, Sergeant. That's what I'm here for. Of course it'll take me a few days to orient myself. You know, this is a pretty big reservation. Yes, it is. So take all the time you want. Now that we've got new blood in here. I'm gonna take it easy. You know your job, so I'm giving you a free hand. Folsom means maximum security and we're stuck with it. But outside of that I welcome any suggestions you have to offer. Oh, that's very kind of you, Warden. I really hadn't expected you-- I know. I've got a tough reputation. But my bark is worse than my bite. Right, Cliff? - That's right, Warden. You've been here before? - Just once. Hart will show you around. - Sure. I know we're gonna get along fine together. Just fine. Thank you, Warden. - See you later. This is the guard relief. The day shift just got on duty. Boys, I want you to meet Mr. Benson, the new Captain. How are you? - Hello, Captain. That's all, fellows. Well, the Folsom's guard line hasn't changed much since I saw it last. Any high school men among 'em? - Yeah, couple, I guess. It's tough to get good men. Yeah, at only $60 a month and their keep you can't buy much for that kind of dough. Let's go see the canning plant first, huh? Here's a guy I think you should know. Rouf, meet the new captain. Rouf Morcher, the oldest con in the pen. Yup, I've been here since 1895. He was eligible for parole 13 years before he applied for it. Then when he got it, he didn't wanna leave. Why not, Roux? Well, you see, Captain I wanted to take my dog Jojo with me. 'I got the warden's permission to take him.' And everything went fine until we got to the front gate. Then he wouldn't move. 'Nothing I could do would make him stir his stubs.' So, I figured, if Jojo didn't like it outside maybe I wouldn't like it neither. No, sir! Sergeant, do you permit dogs in here? No, Jojo's the only one. He's a good ratter. The joint's full of rats. We manufacture and repair all the shoes we use in the place. Hello, Leo. How's it going? Okay, sir. He's Mr. Benson, new Captain of the yard. Hi. How old are you, Leo? Twenty, Captain. He's doing life, murder, first. Tell him how it happened, Leo. I killed my wife. She was 18, five bullets. For every bullet, I quoted a word from the marriage service. "Until-death-do-us-part." Funny thing about it, she didn't do what he thought she did. He knows that, I suppose. He does now. That's a stiff climb. - Sure is. My name is, Brody. - Mine's Benson. I'm the new Captain of the Guard. Glad to know you, sir. Got a good view of the yard from here. Wow! I see some old friends of mine from the Sierra road camp. Yeah, there's Hop Rand and Marty McCain. Hop's got rabbit blood in him. Always taking it out on the lam. That's how come he finally landed in here. That's the noon call, for mess. How much are we allowed per day, to feed the inmates? Fourteen cents per man. Oh. That's less than five cents a meal, isn't it? That's right. What kinda food can be bought for that money? Ha ha, beans. Beans for breakfast, dinner, and supper. Yeah. What I wouldn't give to crash out of this joint and get some decent chow for a change. Yeah, me too. Why aren't the men permitted to talk while they're eating? Warden's orders. That's bad, for morale. I didn't like the looks of the food I saw on those tables either. I don't think the cons like the looks of it. Kinda hot, ain't it? Yeah. Can I get you guys some water? We'll get our own water. Yeah. He's right on time. Tink said we could expect him through here at about 10:30. But watch yourselves now. This is it, stool pigeon. Stay away! stay away! Hey, come on here! - He fell in! 'Get a rope, get a rope. Hurry up.' I don't think he can swim. Who was it? - Gebhardt, he fell in. He can't swim! He'll go over the dam! There's a man in the river! Who was it? - Gebhardt. He slipped, fell in the mill race. We tried to grab him, but it was too late. Alright, get 'em back on the job. Come on, let's go. Who was he, Sergeant? Stool pigeon. That was no accident, Sergeant. Should we go back? Well, did you see everything? I saw an inmate kill one. On of the men on the track gang. He fell into the mill race and was swept over the dam. Who was it? - Gebhardt. Oh. An accident? Yes, Warden, it was an accident. 'Here's his file card.' Evans, bring in your book. O-1342, Carl Gebhardt. Mm, stool pigeon. They... come and go. Uh, wire this man's wife. "I regret to inform you, uh, your husband died as a.." Uh, correction. "Your husband died accidentally, as of this date." "He has, uh, $2 on the prison books." "Please inform us, what you wish done with his body." Sign my name that's all. - Yes, warden. Well, Benson. What do you think of Folsom? It's quite a place, warden. No, no. I wouldn't do that. Yeah. Okay. I'll take care of myself. Yeah, I'll call you later on it. Right, goodbye. Like your new office? - Close to the yard. You picked it. Say, you remember that wire we sent to the wife of the con that was killed down with the dam. The one with the $2 on the prison books? Here's her answer. "You keep the body, send me the $2." Warden, I sent you a list of changes the other day that I... wanted to make. Well, why don't you make 'em? - I was waiting for your okay. I'm giving you a free hand. What more do you want? Well, it's fine. Oh, there's... one other thing. What about those men being punished in the hall? What about them? Well, they'd be coming up for trial in a few weeks. They'll all get the death sentence. Don't you think that's punishment enough? Look, Captain. That's one department I want you to keep your hands off. Is that clear? It's quite clear. Okay. Forget it. What's for breakfast this morning? Same old slop. Bread, mush, skimmed milk and black coffee. Argh! You wanted to see us, Captain? Yes, I did. Sergeant, how can prisoners respect men who have no respect for their own appearance? From now on, the officers of the guard line will report for duty in uniforms that are at least clean. And they'll conduct themselves like officers. Not like thugs. Yes, sir. Stuart. If a pure food inspector was showin' through the prison canteen plat, he'd have apoplexy. The place reeks of filth. And as for discipline..the workers are either bullied by the guards or left to do as they please. The same thing applies to all the shops. Clean 'em up. - Yes, sir. Also, I want that silence sign taken out of the mess hall. Let the men talk while they eat. And as of today, we're taking beans off the prison menu. How can you run a prison without beans? Beans are good wholesome food. Well, they might be if they weren't spoiled. According to the record, ten barrels of rejected food mostly beans were thrown into the ranch hogs last week. Is that right, Stuart? Yes, but what am I gonna feed 'em if I can't feed 'em beans? Feed 'em the ranch hogs. Then they'll get the beans in a more palatable form. Don't you ever feed meat to the inmates? Sometimes. Make it three times a week. What do they get for dessert? Each man gets a... pint of ice cream every fourth of July. Give 'em a pint every Sunday. We've got a dairy herd on the ranch. Put the milk to work. That's all, Stuart. Oh, and don't forget. Meat for dinner. - Meat! Will that be all, Mr. Benson? That's all, Sergeant. What's so funny? I've been reading your file card. That's quite a score, Chuck. You crashed the walls of more jail houses than in any man in the country. What would you do if you were serving a life sentence? Oh, I am afraid, my answer might incriminate me. Besides, I am on the opposing team. How do you like it in here? - Not so good. The jail is full of suspicious characters. You're due to go up pretty soon ain't you, Red? 127 days, 12 hours, 31 minutes, 11 seconds. You can see, he hasn't given it much thought. I see by your file card that you're a licensed dynamite man outside. That's right. I have got a friend in Redwood City in lumber business. I think, I can get you a job out there. Come and see me in a couple of days, will you? Thanks, Captain. I will. - So long, fellas. Not a bad guy. Your move. 'Say, Mr. Benson.' Yes, Stinker? - Uh, that's Tinker not Stinker. That's what I said. - Oh, uh. I would like to talk to you about getting out of here. Alright. I'm-I'm not a confirmed criminal like the rest of the guys in here. I should be on the outside. Maybe, you're right at that, Tinker. You'd probably do more good for the law outside than you would inside. That's what I have been trying to tell everybody. I'll bet that you can keep at least 10 policemen working all the time. All men called for the quarry detail answer to your names. McCain. - Yes. Ryan. - Here. Masters. - Yes. White. - Here. 'Pardue.' - Here. 'Tinker. Tinker!' Here, present, here, here I am. Have a light? 'No!' 'Ferretti.' - Here. 'Daniels.' - Yeah. 'White.' - Here. 'Uneski.' - Here. 'Mesnic.' - Yeah. 'Dailey.' - Here. 'Swede.' - 'Here.' 'Montgomery.' - 'Here.' Let's go. Okay. Alright, come on. We're gonna blow out that big edge up there. Chuck and I'll go ahead with the wire. You fellas follow with those cases. Okay, here's yours. Take it. Walk easy, Tinker. - What's the set up here? Pardue is top powder man. That was his job on the outside. We help them, come on. Uhh. Say Nick... what's in this? - Nitro. What's that? - Dynamite. Dynamite? Hey, hey, watch out for a blast. Uhh, hey, if anything happens to me, I'm gonna quit this job. 'What do you want?' - This is 60% dynamite, Sarge. We use this stuff, it will shatter the rock. The case is marked 40. - They used the wrong stencil. We've got three other cases. - They're all the same, 60. The product company doesn't deliver till tomorrow. Can't you borrow some in town? - Yeah, we might. Put the cover back on that case, Chuck. 'While you're about it, you better get some number six' 'number eight detonator caps. We're running short.' 'I'll have to send you in with the truck to handle the stuff.' Tinker, Ferretti get back to your drilling. You heard, what he said? - Yeah, yeah, I heard him. Hey, where're you going? I got a date, with a guy named Ferretti. Pardue is a licensed dynamite man, Captain. It's safer to let him handle it. Yes, sir, I have a guard I can spare. You go with him, Michaels, get the pick-up truck at the garage. Here's an order for the keys. Stop at the Captain's office on your way up and pick up a pass for Pardue. I'll phone, the stuff will be ready by the time you reach. Where you bound for? - Down to village. Alright. Okay. Wait here a minute. Going to phone my wife, see if she wants anything in town. Cover that truck. Okay, Red. Let's go. Hold it, Red get away from there. What's the matter? I got words that shake this down again. Alright, alright, don't get nervous screw I'm getting out. I know you are. You can kiss that parole good bye, Red. Ah, he didn't know anything about it. I'll bet he didn't, he was driving the truck, wasn't he? Come on inside both of you. I'd have done the same thing in your place. We got to face it, Red. There are no secrets in the prison. 'Only the guards know what happened.' The inmates will figure out that you-- Turned stool pigeon? - I wouldn't put it that way. You're not a con. - That's what I'm getting at. Well. I'm glad to see, one of you cons has a brain in his head. This note you sent up to the tower has gone into the book. Your mind really worked fast didn't it, Red? It had to Warden. I wonder what would've happened if I posted this on the bulletin board out in the yard. 'They'll turn on you like a pack of wolves.' Now, but you don't need to worry. I've told everybody who knows to keep their mouth shut. I think we owe Red a word of thanks. Sure, sure and I appreciate it. Well, Michael's waiting for you in the truck. You go on into town get your dynamite and go right back to your job as if nothing had happened. Yes, sir. You're not going to send him back to the yard, are you? Back to his old job? - Why not? Cons don't know anything about this. Well, they'll find out soon enough. Ferretti was found in the truck, they're liable to suspect, Red. Oh-oh. Let me tell you something. The minute I move Red out of his regular spot every con in Folsom will know he turned Ferretti in. You didn't think of that, did you? You know why? Because that's something you'll learn from experience not from books on psychology. He's going out in a few months, we owe him protection. I need him in the quarry. What do you want me to do, play nurse maid to the guy? I still think, you're risking his life. And I say, I'm still Warden here. You seem to forget that once in a while. That's a bad habit, Mr. Benson. Hey, Peter, I've been looking for you. Where you've been? - To school. Can I carry your books? What'd you study today? - Home Economics. It's all about marriage. That's what you ought to do, get married. Me? Give up my freedom? You're crazy. We missed you since you got transferred, Red. Hey, that's neat. The air from the vent makes it go round. What do you know. What you got it for? Something to look at when I'm trying to sleep. What're you holed up in here for, Red? I don't feel right. You know what day this is? The Placerville Tigers are playing our team this afternoon. You ought to be sitting on top of the world the break you got the other day. You know, Ferretti had made it. Could have dropped the axe on you. What's the matter with you anyway? Nothing. - You sure? I turned Ferretti in. What are you talking about? - I turned him in. I spotted him behind the seat in the cab. I didn't know what to do, Chuck. I thought of my parole, my wife and kids. I had to do it. Does, Ferretti know? - No. Who does? Rickey, Benson, half a dozen guards, you. Ferretti knew that if he did make it, you'd take the rap. That's like sneakin' up behind a guy in the dark and sticking a knife in his back. The other cons won't see it that way. No, they believe what they read about themselves that cons don't talk. 75 percent of the prisoners in every stir I've ever been in, squeal on each other all the time. That's the code of the underworld. Try to make them believe that. To them I'll be a stool pigeon. But not to me, Red. You're the kind of a guy I'd tie to every time. Didn't I take you in on this break I've been planning for years, you're the first guy I told about it. If it wasn't for your parole. You'll be gone with us when we go. Now come on, let's go out and watch that game. Hey, Jennings look what you do. Well, Tinker, you ain't been down here in a long time. Have you missed me? Sent him to do that plumbing job you've been cracking about. It's about time. How would this place ever operate without my hands. Yeah, get in there. Call me when you're through with him. Right. Number nine, Tinker. Got a leaky waste trapped in this one. Can you fix it? A guy can pick a lock, can fix almost anything. See if you can pick that one. 'Sing out when you've finished.' How long they gonna keep you down here? I'll be lucky if I ever get out of here. Nick, how come you got caught? Pardue turned me in. Pardue... no kidding. I didn't know anything about it till a couple of days ago. Pardue, why that don't seem possible. I didn't think he knew I was in the truck, he must've got wise. You see, I got a friend in the captains' office. One of the con clerks. Finally figured out a way to tip me off. You want me to spread the word in the yard? That'll fix him good. - Daniels will cover up for him. Yeah, I guess he would at that. Look, Tinker. I've got close to 300 under prison books. You stop Pardue from going out and it's yours. Have it sent anywhere you say. You know, I've got good connections outside. They can't help me, because I'm in on murder first. They could spring you out in a parole. It'll be a cinch. Accidents happen all the time. What about it, Tinker? What about it? Hey, Jennings, the job's done. Let me out of here. 300 bucks, Tinker. I assure it'll buy a raincheck for you. You'll have to stand still, Red, if you want me to get it right. You know what this means, don't you? I do. You'll be going out tomorrow. But don't worry, I'll have it ready for you. It means my wife'll see me for the first time in five years.. ...without a prison uniform. She's coming up to get me. What's the matter? Don't you think you can find the way home? She'll wear a new dress, blue, like her eyes. She'll straighten my tie and say, "Red, you big lug." And then she won't be able to talk, and neither will I. Red, Noonan wants you over in the quarry. Come on. I'm coming. My last job before I sign out. Right. Tell the sarge we're all ready to blast. She's all wired except this hole. Alright. Everybody stand clear! All clear? - All clear! Keep your head down. What's the matter? - Flying piece of rock got me. I told you to keep your head down. Dobby here got hit. He had to see the fireworks. Go tell Officer Broath to take you in to the doctor. How'd it go? Not so good. One side didn't blow at all. Must be a break in the cable. It's old stuff. I'll find it. It's a break alright, Sarge. - Yeah. Looks like we got a jinx on this job. Hurry it up, Red. 'That explosion got Red.' It wasn't my fault. He kept yanking on the wire. Why didn't you stop him? - I started to. He gave it another yank and it flipped over and made contact. I tried to grab it, but it was too late. He did it himself. I couldn't help it. I never had no trouble with Red. I was no friend of Ferretti's either. So you knew about that, huh? Okay, Tinker. Okay. Come in. Mrs. Pardue, Mr. Benson. I remember you. You gave me a ride to the prison, didn't you? That's right. This isn't my office, Mrs. Pardue but I had you brought here so we wouldn't be disturbed. It's about your husband, Red. Won't you sit down? What's the matter, Captain Benson? Has Red done something wrong? You're not keeping him here any longer, are you? Is he hurt? Tell me! I'm going to tell you, Mrs. Pardue. I'm going to tell you exactly what happened. Well, Benson, what's new? I just finished telling Pardue's wife that he's going out today. What's that? In a box. - Oh, I see. How did she take it? In a way you wouldn't understand. You see... she loved him. You told her it was an accident, of course? I told her it was murder. What do you mean murder? We couldn't prove that in a thousand years. I told her you killed him, Warden. You wouldn't dare say that. When you sent that man back to the yard.. ...you knew that sooner or later the men inside would find out what had happened. He had to take that chance! - The chance you made him take! In your twisted mind a convicted man is no longer human. He's a thing to be kicked around, to be thrown away. That's how you show your courage. By stepping on men who can't strike back. Why, you phony reformer.. You're all worked up, Captain, or you wouldn't say such things. I face these cons, thieves, murderers, all alone, unarmed.. ...that's why they have respect for me. They hate you, Rickey. They despise you. Maybe, but not to my face. I had you figured right, Benson. Your psychology is just another name for weakness. It takes guts to run a prison. No, it takes brains. Brains and understanding, and all you have is beef. You talk that way to me! Listen, I got news for you. From now on, I run this prison my way. That's the only way you understand. There's a change coming, a big change. Only you're too blind to see it. Yeah? There are men in this country who're making a science of phrenology. Not weak men, strong men. Strong, because they're right, Rickey. Before long the prisons of this state will be in their hands. Tell that to the board! - They know it! And they know that you and your kind are on their way out. You're dated Rickey. You're a back number. You have no fear of thieves and murderers because you think the way they do. You're as much a psychopathic case, as any man in here. And you're making the same blunders every dictator made since time began. Study the records.. ...and you'll see they all went down in disaster. Give me Sergeant Hart. - 'Hart speaking.' Hello, Hart, the Warden speaking. Mr. Benson has just resigned I want you to take his place and I want you to revoke every change made by Benson while he was captain. From now on, the rule is rigid discipline. And the tougher, the better. That's all for now. Well, they seem to be taking it alright, don't they? What else can they do but take it? I'll be late for dinner. You're in charge, Sergeant. You mean Captain, don't you? - Yeah, Captain. Keep your eyes open. - Right. This might be the time for it. Are you ready? Pass the word on to McCain and Ryan as we go out. They know what to do. Eh, who you steppin' on, big foot? Alright! Two. Four. Two. Did it work? - It sure did. They counted him. Now, they're all yours. - Okay. Alright, Cliff. - 'Goodnight.' Collins calling, from the gun gallery at No. 1. Everything's quiet. Get back! Drop that! Drop that stick. Are you crazy, Daniels? - I said drop it. That's it. Now, get on back to 197. Come on. Alright, you gotta open this. Hurry up! Come on. Here, get McCain and Ryan. - Right. Listen, everybody! 'We're going out.' 'Those of you who wanna go along, be ready!' Those that don't, play low or you'll get hurt! Alright, let's go. Get him down there. Chuck. 'What's the matter, Tinker? You getting nervous?' Fray and I wanna be out. Let us out of here, will you? Take it easy. We'll get around to you boys. At the desk. Where's the hot stuff? - We got it. Give here. Smell that screw. Get on the phone, get Hart. - What will I say to him? Exactly, what I tell you to and nothing else. Give me Captain Hart's office. Hart speaking. - 'This is Castle, Mr. Hart.' 'I'm in the old block.' 'There's something wrong with the gun guy, Collins.' Yeah? What's the matter? - I don't know-- He's got a stroke. Tell him to get over here. Maybe he's got a stroke. You better get over here. Okay. He's on his way. He's got the key to the door to the administration building. That's the way we are going out. Now, come on. We'll meet him there. You too. Come on. Drop this. Get 'em up! Frisk him. - Alright. He's okay. I want the key to the door to the administration building. You're out of luck, Daniels. I haven't got it. Where is it? - The Warden has it. Where's he? - He's home, having dinner. Good, well go call him up. At the desk! Call Rickey and tell him you need that key. Tell him to send it to Cellblock 1. Well, go on! Get at it. Hart speaking. Connect me with the Warden's home. What do you want, Wong? Mr. Hart's on the phone, Warden. A man can't even eat his dinner in peace. Hello, Cliff. What do you want? I'm in old cell block, number one, Warden. There's a break going on here. The cons have got guns! Hello? Cliff? Cliff? Operator? Operator? This the Warden, there's a break going on in Block No. 1. Turn on the alarm! We'll come when we're ready for you! Call Towers 18 and 21 and tell him to keep that searchlight on Cell house No. 1. Yes, sir. Get me Tower 18. What're you doing here? - I came to help you. I don't need your help. I can thank you for what's happening. I understand these men leading the riot. Let me talk to them. You wanna get killed? - No, they'll listen. No, that's out. - Maybe stable the position. Why should I? - It'll affect the rioters. Troops mean they're beaten. - I've asked for no help, yet. But you'll save lives, you haven't enough men to handle it. I know what I'm doing and I don't want your advice. Warden, they're sending a man out under a white flag. He's talking to one of the screws. Now, they're taking him to the Captain's office. Well. Warden, I've got nothing to do with this. They opened my cell and sent me with a message. That's all. How'd you get out? Through the gun gallery. - How did you get up there? They got a rope. If you don't make a deal with them.. ...they're gonna start killing the guards, one at a time. Yeah? They want the keys to the administration building. And that you let 'em out of the front gate. How many? - Oh, there's six of 'em. Once the way is cleared, they'll take a couple hundred with them. They told me to tell you if I ain't back in ten minutes they're gonna start killing guards, anyhow. Very fair offer, eh, Mr. Benson? Just about what I had expected. If you don't send him back, they'll kill those men. Don't worry. I'm sendin' him back. He's coming back. You stay here, Leo. Keep your eyes open. Come on, you two. The guy who we sent is on his way back. You stick here and keep this door covered. Is that you, Ed? - Yeah. What's the Warden's answer? - I got it right here! 'Chuck! Chuck!' It was Rickey! I got him! Make sure. - Okay. Rickey, huh? So, that's the way they want it. Alright, they'll get it. Come on. Don't bunch up around here. Ferretti. Tom. Go down and cover those windows at the other end. Go, get going. Get out of here! Get back you guys! Come on! 'Hold your fire!' Hold your fire! Hold your fire! They stopped shooting. What does that mean? - We'll find out. Keep that opening covered. They cut the lights. - Take it easy. 'Daniels.' - Hold it. 'I wanna talk to you.' - It's Benson. What do you want? The Warden? You're too late, he's dead. - You're gonna surrender. What for? So you can string us all up? 'You've committed murder.' - That's what you call it. 'If this thing goes on we'll be forced to attack the cell house' with explosives! Every man in there will die. I want you to send out Sergeant Hart and the guards. Also the men who are still locked in their cells. Then you ring leaders must come out alone. Unarmed and with your hands over your head. 'I'm offering you, your only chance, Daniels.' 'You've got five minutes.' Look who's out there. One minute! We might as well face it. Turn all those guys loose in the cell blocks. Three minutes! Better turn those guns over to us. Go on, get out of here, while you got the chance. Hey, Chuck. You're sending us out with the others, ain't you? Yes, Tinker, we're sending you out. The both of you. Sending you out, just like you sent out Red Pardue. 'Four minutes!' Get ready to duck, you guys. - No, not this time. Don't Nick, that's dynamite. There you have a story from my notorious past. Today, the picture is an entirely different one. Through the years that followed my board of directors gave me modern new buildings to house my growing population. But what is more important, they gave me a change of heart administrators who were merciful, as well as just. Today under the direction of an enlightened phrenologist my guards are chosen by competitive examination and without political interference. My walls are still impregnable but the prisoners inside them are treated as individuals for what they are and for what ails them. I am still overcrowded. There is still the evil of two men in a cell but that will be corrected by a legislation. In my prison hospital you will find every modern appliance.. ...every expert medical care.. ...to correct a man's thinking you must keep his body fit. And by the same token you must occupy his mind. Eleven million license plates were produced this year.. ...inmates are paid a nominal wage. And are given a chance to regain their self respect. I can't keep all the men you send to me. A great majority will one day be sent out on parole. Their care, their rehabilitation is you problem, as well as mine. You can't lock them up and forget them. Sooner or later, one of them may be your next door neighbor. If they send you to me now, I'll be just. I'll be humane. But don't get me wrong. I'm no pushover. You will still find that there is no substitute for freedom.
