I suppose theydon't give your music a little appreciation. You should listen to myold record sometime-- Yeah, but theyjust send me to sleep. What about yours? Yours can't even wait! - That's my favorite. Look at this, justlike in the magazine. - I made it just for you. - Oh, Peter, isn'tthat beautiful? - It's lovely, Barbara. - Look at that, she's talented. - Well anyway, I'm sorryI don't call it music. - Oh, Daddy! - No, the tunes aren't tunes, the lyrics, you can't hear them. I mean-- - Really? What's your ideaof music, huh Bob? Operetta? â™ª When I'm calling you - Oh Lord. That sounds like Mrs.Duncan's dog howling. - Oh, really. Well, you know, Julie andher friends are younger, they want something witha little life in it, do you mind? - No, well, life is onething, and noise is another. - It's not noise. You're such an old fuddy-duddy. Isn't he, Auntie Helen? - Yes. - What do you think, Peter? - If it isn't in a bookthat's at least 50 years old, Peter doesn't evenknow that it exists. - Now honey, that isa slight exaggeration. - No, no, no. Book selling is notonly his profession, but it's his religion. His one true faith. Books. - There is some truthin that, actually. - Ah, there sure is. - Well, now, who hasroom for some trifle? - Well, I think Icould force myself. - Great.- Mhm, that's me. Going to be bad. - Well, I'm veryglad to hear it. - So, Bob, you're notgonna recognize your wife? What? Tomorrow. - I'm taking them with medown to London tomorrow, you remember. - Oh, yes. - Now you'll be sittingthere, sipping your tea, minding your own business, and in will walk this gorgeous, drop dead platinum blonde, hair piled up in a French twist. How would you like aFrench twist, hey, Bob? - Well frankly, I don'tthink it would suit me. - Oh, really. Well, I think it would suit you, I think it wouldlook great on you with a little hat, little veil. - Uncle Peter! - Julie, you blinded me. - Well, I just realizedwe don't have any pictures of you and UnclePeter in the album. - Oh, but Julie, youshouldn't take pictures without asking permission. - Yeah. You caught me withmy mouth open. - How else would she catch you? - What's that supposed to mean? I never shut up? No. - Look, I've justgot one more exposure left on this roll. Mom, Auntie Helen? - Oh, no, no.- Come on. - Let's show her whatglamour's all about. Come on, Barb. Loosen up! I've seen morelaughs at a funeral. - No, it's no problem,I'll take her. - Go on, go on. Oh I know, but youshouldn't have to! - I'll drop heroff at the school. - Yes, but she should be able to get to school on her own. - Mom, it's muchtoo cold to walk! - Well, look at you! Button up, it won't be too cold. Look at your scarf. Oh, Julie, at leastkeep your chest covered. - Look, I'm fine. - Now get in. There you go. Bye bye now. - Have a nice time in London. - Yes, thank you. Morning. - Good morning. - Hi, honey. Ready? - Every morningit's the same thing. Julie gets up 15 minutes late, gobbles down herbreakfast, and then it's-- - No, no, no, get in the front. - No, you get in the front! - Oh, will you just relax and get in the frontand ride with Peter? - All right. - You're our guest. - Thank you. - Okay, off we go. - Next stop, London. - Oh now, look at thesebook binder shoes. These would be good for Peter. Of course, I'd neverbuy those shoes. I mean, if he tried to buyshoes for me, I'd kill him. - Oh, look at the kitty. - It's very cute,you should get that. - No, I'd never wear. - Oh, you might. It's cute. - Mm, cashmere. I love cashmere. Now look, that would bea pretty color on you, with your eyes. - It would, wouldn't it? It's very nice. - And that would be nice on you. - Orange? - Yes. Something bright. - You know, we should comeback after the holidays, when they have the sales. - No, no, we should get it now. They might be gone by then. You know, as my AuntSophie used to say, "If it talks to you, buy it." - Good woman, Sophie. Oh, that would be pretty on you. - No, no, this is for you-- - For me? - Look how beautiful, yes. - Oh, I couldn'twear that color. - Oh, Barbara, I'm surethat Bob would love this. - Bob? - Yes, in fact, I knowfrom personal experience that he would lovethis nightgown. - Oh, you do? - Yes, I do. You see, Bob and Ihave been, well-- You vamp, you. - No, really, really,look at this on you. It would be sogreat, this color. - But don't youthink I look better in softer colors? - No, no, I thinkyou need color, and patterns, and prints, and-- - Really? - Barbara, yes. Look at that hat. - Don't you like my hat? - Not really. It makes you looklike the queen mom. - Well, she's anattractive woman. - Yes, but, is thatthe kind of image that you're trying to project? - You're right. All right. - There, you see? Better already. - Is it? - Yes, you look great. - Good. - Did I hear you say that you bought me some new socks? - Oh yes, love. Right over there in the back. Oh wait, Julie. Honestly, I haveto do this here. - Hello, hello! What's all this then? Don't tell me you're seriouslyconsidering wearing this. - Oh, that sneak. - Helen. - Yeah, she must'veput that in the bag when I wasn't looking. - Oh, it's beautiful.- Bit much. - Well, I think youshould wear it, Mom. Julie! - Well, if you don'twant to wear it, I'd be glad to! - You won't, my girl. - I bet that's her now. "Sweetheart, I'mright out of coffee. "Do you have any?" - Oh God, I wish you wereallowed to use the telephone. - Come on, Julie,get back to work. - Mr. Jackson. - Yes? - Ah, good evening. My name's Stewart. I'm investigating a certainmatter in this neighborhood and well, I wanted to havea little word with you and your family. This is my identification,by the way. - Ah. The Metropolitan Police. - Yes, yes. If you want confirmation,ring Scotland Yard. Whitehall, 1212. Ask for Superintendent Watts. Is theresomething wrong? - No, this is Mr. Stewart,he's from the police. - On an inquiry. Well, youbetter come in. Thank you very much. I'll justmake that call. - Ah, yes, of course. Thank you. - Is something wrong? - Wrong? - Well, if you'rehere on an inquiry-- - Oh, no, no, no, I was justexplaining to your husband, I'm gathering somebackground information. Oh, good evening. I wonder, is SuperintendentWatts there-- - Jackson. Are these paintings yours? - Afraid so. - No, they're charming. - Oh, thank you. - What are you studying? - Oh, history. - Oh. - I'm writing anessay on the Tudors. - Oh, the Tudors. Oh, I used to be able torattle all that off by heart. You know, the Tudorsand the Stuarts, no relation, I'm afraid. - May I get you sometea, Mr. Stewart? - No thank you, no, no. - Thank you verymuch, Superintendent. Right. Bye. - Ah, well. Now I hope SuperintendentWatts managed to convince you that I wasn't going to run off with the family silver. - No, he didn't tell mewhat you had come for. - Ah, well, if you hadn'trobbed me of my little speech... May we sit down? - Oh, please. - First of all, I must apologize for barging in on you like this. The fact is, we need your help, on a very delicate matter. - Are you a policeman? - Technically, yes. Only I work mostlywith the civil service, which as you know, cancover the multitude of sins. - What sort of an inquiry? - Well, that's ratherdifficult to explain precisely, because so much ofmy work does consist of confidential matters. But one thing I can tell you, we have become interestedin a particular chap, and this chap has been seenregularly in the neighborhood. We want to know alittle more about him, and I'm afraid that means asking rather a lot ofboring questions. - Does this chaplive around here? - He comes here most weekends. We think he has friendsin this neighborhood. - Well, what's his name? What's he look like? - Powell. Lawrence Powell is his name. At least that's his nameat the moment. Have you seen him? - No. Doesn't look familiar to me. - Mr. Jackson? - No. - Miss Jackson? - No. Doesn't look likea very nice man. What's he done? - Well, I'm afraid I can'ttell you that, Miss Jackson. - Oh, it's confidential? - Yes, that's right. But has someoneactually seen him around here? - Oh, we've been keeping aneye on him for some time. - You mean, you followed him? - To this neighborhood, yes. And that's what bringsme to your door, in fact. We're looking for a few places, where we can keep an eye out, on the occasionalSaturday and Sunday. We want to know an awful lotmore about this Mr. Powell. Now, the problem is, how can our people observewithout being observed? In these quietstreets where everyone knows everyone else,you see the difficulty. Now, our peoplemust be concealed. Well, it's the only way. And we're looking for aplace here, in Hartley, a room, somewhere, where we can keep aneye on the neighborhood. - What do you mean, a room here? Just fora day or two, yes. - Well, I don't know about that. - Well, I'd do it myself. Just me. One Saturday, one Sunday. - Where would youwatch from, here? - Upstairs. Yeah, I thought thebay window upstairs. - In our bedroom? - That's perfect! - Good look outpost,hey, Miss Jackson? - Oh, yes! - I mean, couldn'tyou watch from a car? A parked car? Couldn't you do that? - These roads aroundhere are very empty. An unfamiliar vehicle parkedfor any length of time-- - Mm, yes, I see. - If there was areasonable alternative, I do assure you, we wouldn'tbe bothering you like this. Did you build this, Mr. Jackson? - Yes. Yes, I have. I work in the aircraft industry. - Yes, I know. - You know? - Well, we wouldn't dream ofacting a favor like this of you if we didn't knowsomething about you. - Oh, you mean youhad us screened? - Well, as your work involvessome classified material, we knew, well, whatwe needed to know. What is that? - That we could trust you. Presumablythis man has committed a crime of some sort. - We have every reasonto believe that he has been involved in some formof illegal activity, yes. - Yes, well I mean,wouldn't it be dangerous? - Oh, there's no needto worry about that, he's not a thug. No, there's no danger ofany physical violence. - What do you think? - I don't know. It's up to you. - All right, then. All right. - All right. - Thank you. Thank you very much indeed. When wouldyou want to do this? - Well, I'll let youknow as soon as possible, and I will do my best togive as much notice as I can. Now, I've taken up quiteenough of your time. Oh, by the way,yes, if anybody asks who was visiting you tonight, just say it wasyour insurance man. - Why should anyone ask? - Well, you know how curiouspeople sometimes are. Yes, while we'reon that subject, it is very importantnot to tell anyone about any of this. And I do mean absolutely nobody. No family, no friends,no school chums. Better safe than sorry, aye? Goodnight, thanks again. Yes, well I'll-- Goodnight. - See you out. - Oh, Mom, isn't it exciting? I wonder what this man,this pal could've done. - Mhm. - What can you doin Hartley Drive? It's so boring. - Please hold still. Last pin. All right. - Ow! - Ah, what? - Nothing.- All right. Is that all right?- Just undo it. Would you, please?- Yes. - It's gonna be very nice. Well... Knowing you, you're gonnahave it all stitched together by the time I getacross the street. - Careful, careful. Oh, hardly. - You know, before I forget, I have this for Julie. - What is it? - Well, a friend of minesent it to me from Toronto. You know, you can't evenget this record here yet. - Is it another one ofthose rock n' roll things? - Yes, it is. I think you would evenlike this one, Barbara. - I doubt it. I don't understand, halfthe boys in the neighborhood are trying to look likerock n' roll singers. I don't know why. That Malcolm Granger thatJulie's been spending time with. Ugh. - Oh, I've seen him. He's a good looking boy. - Yeah, so he's not gonnahave those locks for very long if he keeps on speedingabout on that motorbike. He's just reckless,completely irresponsible. - This is great, isn't it? â™ª Come on, baby - Now look, I want toshow you some steps. Watch this. â™ª Come on, baby - Good, get intoit, get into it. That's right, let go, let go. Very good. Now let's see. Can you try? Good, Barb. Very good. Now swim! Just go with it, that's it, yes. Oh! â™ª Oh, baby, baby, twist - Stop, Mom, you were great! Just wait 'til I tell Dad! - Oh, don't be silly. - What is that record anyway? - Well, a friend of minesent it over for you, do you like it? - Oh, Auntie Helen! Thank you! You're welcome. Well, you see now, you'rea very, very good dancer. Really, you've got the moves. We should go down to that club, what do you callit, the Jazz Club? - Oh yeah, you've already got me going to the art class. Answer the phone,will you, Julie? - Okay. - But you're enjoying theart class, aren't you? - Well, yes, but youcan't just do everything that you enjoy, can you? Why not? - Here. Helen, if everyonehad your attitude-- - Oh, then theEarth would crack, and the sky would fall. - Well, no, but I meanBob does, on occasion, like to find me at home. I am his wife, after all. - Yes, but you don't haveto be just a housewife, you can be your own person too. - It's for you, Mom. - Who is it? - I don't know, he didn't say. - Oh, well, make thetea, will you, love? Hello. - It's Mr. Stewart here, I wonder if you rememberme the other evening. Is this a good moment? - I want to talk toyou a minute, kiddo. - What? - Well, I thought youweren't supposed to go charging around town on thebacks of motorcycles, hm? - When did you see me? - The other afternoon, withyoung mister what's his name? - Malcolm. - Yeah, Mr. Malcolm. I thought all of thatwas strictly forbidden. - He was only bringingme home from school, and he's very careful. And it's so exciting,Auntie Helen. - Well, your Momdoesn't think so. - Oh, she keeps treatingme as if I were 12 or 13. - Honey, worrying is whatbeing a mother is all about. It goes with the territory. Particularly with yourmother, for some reason. - Yes, but I'm old enoughto take care of myself. - What about this Malcolm? What about him? - Well, he's kinda cute. - Yeah. Well? Well, what? - You know what I mean. - He wants to, but I don't know. - Well, this is onepoint where I see eye to eye with yourmother, you know? - Yeah, but Momdoesn't say anything. - How do you feel? - I don't know. I don't think I'm ready yet. - Well then, don't letMalcolm talk you into anything that you don't want to do. You know, it's a veryimportant lesson. If you want to sayno, just say no. If you have anyproblems with that, you just come talk to meabout it anytime you want. - Thanks, Auntie Helen. Look, about the motorbike-- - I won't say anything. But shouldn't you wear a helmet? You be careful. - Yeah, I will. Thank you. - Yes, I'll tell him whenhe comes in, Mr. Stewart. Bye. - So, what's cooking? - Shepherd's pie, actually. - Mm! - Who was that onthe phone, Mom? - It was someonefor your father. - I thought Irecognized his voice. - Yes, hang your clothesup, will you, Julie? - All right, Barb, we'reall alone now, fess up. - What? - Who was on the phone? - It was one of my lovers. - Really? Which one? - The Italian one. - Oh, that Italian waiterfrom the other day? You slipped him your number? - How did it go? Did you talk to Julie? - Oh, yes I did, she'sgonna be all right. She's not gonna letMalcolm talk her into anything she doesn't want to do. - You sure? - Oh yeah, she'll be all right. Trust her. - I do. - You're very lucky tohave Julie, you know. - Yes. And I'm very lucky to have you. Frankly, I don't know whatI ever did without you. Here's your tea. - Well, thank you. - Oh, Mr. Stewart rang up today. - Oh, did he? What did he want? - He wants to come this weekend. - What, Saturday and Sunday? - Mhm. - Does that meanhe's going to start looking out of the windows then? - I gather that's the idea. - Right. I wonder if we'll get tosee him arrest someone. - Julie, please don'ttalk with your mouth full. - Wow. He's not wastingmuch time, is he? - There you go. Here, I'll put it in your bag. All right. Come on,Julie, it'll be great. - You can't just swoopdown and expect me to drop everything. - Why not? - Well, maybe Ihave plans today. - But that's thetrouble see, plans. What about being spontaneous? - Malcolm, I can't go. - All right. What about tomorrow? - Well, let's wait'til tomorrow, I'll see how spontaneous I feel. - Okay then. I'll call you tomorrow. - All right. That'sthe boyfriend, is he? That's Malcolm, yes. - You don't entirely approve. - Oh, well, I don'tsuppose he's a bad boy. He's a carpenter's apprentice. But that motorbike ofhis, I can't bear it. I mean, it is so dangerous. Who'sthat lady coming out of the house opposite? - That's Helen. Helen Schaefer. She's afriend of your daughter's? - Oh, all of us, actually. Helen, and Peter,and Bob, and Julie, and I, we're all friends. Here's a portrait I didof her in art class. - Oh, that's very good. - Thank you. We go to art class together. Or art class, as she would say. Oh, they'reAmericans, are they? The Schaefers? Don't lether hear you say that. Oh, asore subject, aye? - Oh, once they had a party, they were introducedas an American couple. And Helen said, "NotAmerican, Canadian!" And she was quitefierce about it. - Well, I supposeit's having the States just to the south gettingall the attention, aye? If I were Canadian, I expectI'd be touchy about it too. Yes, well, shespent most of her early life on a farm in Canada. Oh, did she? - Mhm, she was broughtup by her Aunt Sophie, whom she never stops quoting. Well, is there anything elseI could get you, Mr. Stewart? - No thanks, no, no. - How's Sherlock Holmesdoing upstairs then? - All right, I think. - Yeah? - I don't have tofeed him, do I? - No, no, he wouldn'texpect us to feed him. What are we having? - Chopped potatoesand Brussels sprouts. - Oh. Well, I suppose youbetter offer him some. - Well, I've only gotsix chops, little ones. Well, I suppose Julie andI could each have one. - No, he could have my sprouts. - That's very generous of you. Mr. Stewart. We thought you might be hungry. - Oh, that's very nice of you. - Is it all right here? - It is, yes, thank you. You shouldn't of bothered. - Oh, no bother,hope you enjoy it. Have you seen him? - No, not yet. But, well, there'sthe rest of the day. And there's always tomorrow. - Well. - Here we are. - Oh, sorry. - That's all right. - Have you finished then? - Yes, for today. - Did you see him? - No, I'm afraid not. - You'll be bytomorrow, same time? - Yes, if that's all right. - Oh yes, of course. - Dominoes, aye? - Perhaps he's been inanother street, Mr. Stewart. Or maybe he won't even comedown here this weekend. - Oh no, he'll turnup, Miss Jackson. He's wandering about,we've seen his car. Oh, yes, thanks for the chops. Not at all. - Very nice. - There's your lemonbarley there, Mr. Stewart. - Oh, that's nice, thank you. - Any sign of him? - No, I'm afraid not. That's the troublewith a job like mine. The boredom factor'sextremely high. - Well, you musttell that to Julie. She's convinced that it's allvery romantic and exciting. - Oh, she's a nice girl. And she's making a damngood job of your car. Oh, those must be the Duncansyou've been telling me about, from number 39, was it? Yes. They've lived here evenlonger than we have. He's not been well. - Ah. - Do you havefamily, Mr. Stewart? - Two boys and three girls. - Five? - Yeah, we're gluttonsfor punishment. Well, it's not so badnow they're growing up, but you know, whenthey were small, why don't you tryreasoning with five kids and hanging on to your sanity. All in all, I think it'sbeen worth it, though. Just a minute. What is it? - There he is. - Powell? Where? - Coming out of theSchaefer's house. I must phone the office. I'll tell them, I'lltell them right away. Yes, well, it confirmswhat I thought all along. Yes, I think thatwe've got to be going, still, which isan open question. Excuse me a minute. Mr. Jackson. - Yeah? - Something's happened. Your wife is upstairs. I want to talk toyou both about it, and I don't want yourdaughter to be involved. - Why, what's happened? - Well, your wife will tell you. Excuse me, I haveto finish this call. Mr. Ellis? - Stewart says he wantsa word with us up here. Do you know what it's about? - We saw Powell comingout of Helen and Peter's. - Mr and Mrs. Jackson. A colleague of mine, Mr. Ellis, he would very muchlike you to have dinner with him on Thursday. About seven o'clock, hesuggests his country club, near Gerard's Cross. I'll be there too. - My wife tells meyou've seen Powell, coming out of Helenand Peter's house. - Yes. Well, isthat what Mr. Ellis wants to see us about? - Well, that ispart of the reason. In the meantime of course, you mustn't say anythingabout this to anybody. - Not even to Helen and Peter? - We're seeing them fordinner on Wednesday evening. - Yes, but you'llhave to go ahead as if nothing had happened. - But something has happened. We've seen Powell comingout of their house, he's a criminal, isn't he? - It's crucially importantthat he does not know we're watching him. And that meansthat the Schaefers mustn't suspect anything either. - Why, you thinkthat they'd tell him? - Well yes, ofcourse they might. I mean, without meaning to. And then where would we be? All of which of course,means yes, do see them, go ahead, go to dinner,have a good time, but don't say anything about it. I appreciate that youhaven't been told too much about all this. And I think I mustwarn you now that you are now subjectto the provisions of the Official Secrets Act. - Official Secrets Act? - What's that? - Well, it just aboutcovers everything to do with police work. I had thought of bringingthe declaration along for both of you to sign,just in case we saw him, but I realized ofcourse that in your case there was no need to do that. But even without signing,well, Mr. Jackson, I don't have to remind youthat it is a criminal offense to talk about it to anyone. - Criminal offense? Mom,when are we eating? - Uh, soon. Julie, could you setthe table please, love? Okay. - I think I must askyou not to say anything to your daughter about all this, or about the dinner on Thursday. - Well, I'll have totell her something about where we're going. - Well, you're havingdinner with your boss. She'll believe that, won't she? - Julie lives in this house too. If it concerns us,it concerns her. - I do appreciatethat, Mrs. Jackson, but it really wouldbe much better if she didn't knowanything at all about it. I'll take this down, shall I? I'm afraid I can't giveyou any more information about all this,nothing 'til Thursday. - I'll take that. - Anyway, thank you both again. Thank you very much indeed. - Well, it doesn't seem right. I mean, if Powell's a criminal,they should be warned. - Look, the best waythat we can help them is to get this businesssorted out, right? - I don't know. - Yeah, well, now that iswhat Stewart is tying to do. We have to trust him. - Why? - Well, because hehas the authority. All right, well look,let's put it this way. I mean, he is doing a job, and it is up to usnot to jeopardize it. Anyway, you heard what he said, about the Official Secrets Act. - If it were theother way around-- What? - Well, if Helenknew that someone who came to our house regularly, someone we trusted,were a criminal, well, don't youthink she'd warn us? - I don't know. - Well, she would, Bob,you know she would. You'vereally captured her. Oh,it's just a drawing. No really, thedetails are just great. I mean, they're muchbetter than mine. Mine are so messy and so easy. Yes, butyours are so free. You're comingalong amazingly, Barbara. Oh, don'tlook at that one. Looks like Stan Laurel. It does not. That's great. And thisis from life class. Oh, very good. - Ah, yes. Well, I must say I preferred it when you were doing flowers. At least you couldput those on the wall. - Now, why couldn't youhang that on the wall, Bob? - Oh, naked men, yeah. - Bob. The museums are filledwith studies like this. - I know, but museumsare full of things that I wouldn't wantin my home, thank you. - Well, perhaps you'dprefer naked women. Maybe I should pose forBarbara in the nude, huh? How would you like to haveme in your wall, naked, Bob? - Helen, please. Your wife, Peter. That's the reason we have walls, so that we don't seeour neighbors withouttheir clothes on. - Yeah.- Well put, Bob. - Listen, if I can'ttempt you with the flesh, how about a little booze, huh? Want some, Barb? - Yes, I'll help. - No, no, you stay thereand entertain the troops, I'll be right back. - So I see you've beento the National Gallery. - Oh, well, our teachersays you can learn a lot from sketching in museums. - Oh, I know whatyou would love. Hold on. This is a book of drawings from the Clark Institutein Massachusetts. - Uh huh. Ooh! Yes. Beautiful. - You like it? - Oh, yes! - It's yours. - What? - The book, it's a present. - Oh, Peter, I couldn't,it's much too expensive. - Oh, please. It's my way of saying thank you for being such agood friend to Helen. You've done a lot for her. - It's really morethe other way around. - Oh, but you see, that'spart of what I mean. You know I'm in theshop most of the time, she can get awfully lonely here. - Yes. It's a shame that youdecided against adoption. - Well, we keep hoping. You know, it's the luckof the draw, right? - Helen would makea wonderful mother. - Oh, Bob. Since I'm handing out the books, this just came in,you're gonna love it. All about the first flightsacross the Atlantic. - Here we are. - God, a book about aircrafts. - A cheap little wine withdelusions of grandeur. Barbara. - Thank you. - And I made some littledoo dads here too. There you go. There's this great PeterSellers movie out now. Let's go see it. Want to?- Oh, lovely. - How about tomorrow.?- Of course. - Oh, goodie. - No, no, we can't,you're forgetting. It's Thursday. - Oh, yes. What's Thursday? - Well, boringly enough, we're spending theevening with my boss. - So, we'll bring him along. - He doesn't likegoing to the cinema. - He doesn't like the cinema, what kind of a guy is this? I don't think you shouldbe working for this guy. Why don'twe go on Saturday? Give yourself a breakfrom the weekend. - Sorry, Bob. You know, the weekends,we just can't do it. - Your weekend retreatfrom the world. That's right. - Well, Peter ownsme on the weekends. He has me chained to theaccounts, and everything else. But um, we'll go to themovies another time, we'll do it another time. - All right. - To something important. - To art. - And naked men. - Mr. And Mrs. Jackson. How kind of you to join us. This is Mr. Ellis. - How do you do?- How do you do? Mr. Jackson. - Hello. - Now please, come andmake yourself comfortable. - Thank you. - Good evening madam, sir. Drink for your guest, sir? - Mrs. Jackson. - Oh, nothing for me, thank you. - Oh, come along now, the government'spaying after all. I mean, it's notevery day they give us a treat like this,is it, Stewart? - No, it's a rareopportunity, Mrs. Jackson. - Well, I'll have agin and tonic, please. Certainly, madam. Mr. Jackson? - I'd like a scotchplease, scotch and soda. - Stewart. Oh, of course. You don't drink, do you? - Soda water, please.- Yes. - Ah, Mr. Stewarthas his principles. I on the other hand, willhave another pink gin. - Very good, sir. And I'll bring the menu. - Ah, yes, I think you'llenjoy the food here. We've got a wonderfulItalian chef. Well, I'm delighted to meet you, because Mr. Stewart'sbeen telling me how wonderfulcooperative you've been, and thanks to you, andsome other kind people, we've found out a gooddeal about Mr. Powell. One thing, we ascertained heentered the country illegally with a false passportand an assumed name. - But surely you haven'tgone to so much effort to watch him forsomething so small? - There's a strong possibility that he may be working covertly for a foreign government. - What do you mean, he's a spy? - Possibility exists. - We don't want tojump to any conclusions until we know a little bit more. What woulda spy be doing in Helen and Peter's house? - Well, quite. Ah, hereare the drinks. A gin for the lady. Soda water here. You wanted iceand lemon, Mrs. Jackson? - That's fine. Whiskyfor the gentlemen. - Oh, I must say, I'venever enjoyed drinking soda water on its own. It must be rather like eatingmustard as a main course. We'llorder in a minute. Very good, sir. - Your very good healths. - Cheers. - Mr. and Mrs. Jacksonhave known the Schaefers for nearly three years? - Yes. So you know them well? - They're our very best friends. - And they've never talkedto you about Mr. Powell? - No. - No, never. - That's strange,don't you think? - Why strange? - Well, this man comes to seethem almost every weekend. One would've thought thatafter nearly three years, you're their friends,he's their friend, that they'd ofintroduced you to him, or mentioned his nameat the very least. - Well, perhaps it's aprofessional relationship. - What is it that Mr.Schaefer does again? - A book teller. - Yeah, well, itdoesn't really work, because Mr. Powell isthe director of a firm that makes anti-burglardevices for cars. What's it called? - Allo SecurityProducts Limited. - Yes, lad. And he's a bit ofa man around town, plenty of girlfriends. Not at all a likely companion for a book seller and his wife. - You seem to know anawful lot about him. - Not enough, alas. - Are you sure youdidn't know which house he had been visiting? What do you mean? - Well, it does seem anextraordinary coincidence that you selected thehouse just exactly opposite Helen and Peter's. I mean, it seems almosttoo good to be true. - We all deserve a little luck from time to time, Mrs.Jackson, or where would we be? - Excuse me, waiter. Another bottleplease, thank you. - Would you liketo have wine, sir? - Thank you very much. Ah, yes. I think you'd like this. Now if you'd leavethe bottle with me-- Certainly, sir. - Thanks so much. Thank you. - Mrs. Jackson. - None for me, thank you. - Oh. - So, what happens now? - Well, clearly wehave to find out what this fellowPowell is up to, that's very important. - Yes.- Crucially important. - Oh, yes. - Which means alas, chancewe'll sing a little longer on your hospitality. - In what way? - Well, we think that Powell may be under a lot of pressure, and this may make him dosomething rash, even reckless. Well, if he does, wewant to know about it. Now this means keepinga 24 hour watch on all the places he'slikely to turn up at, and I'm afraidthat this includes keeping somebody in your house. As from tomorrow. If that's possible. - A 24 hour watchfrom our bedroom? I'm afraid so, yes. - But where are we to sleep? - You have a spare bedroom? - Solution presents itself. - You want to move usout of our bedroom? Oh, justfor a week or so. - But Mr. Ellis, he can't, I mean you can't do that. I mean, no, it'sout of the question. - Well, we wouldn'task you to do it if it wasn'tabsolutely necessary. - There must be aneasier way to find out what you want to know. Well, weonly wish there were. - Well, why don't yougo over and ask them? Ask Helen and Peter whatthey know about this man? Yes, of course. - That could reallyupset the apple cart. - Why, what do you mean? - If in fact they wereinvolved with him in some way-- - Well, they're not. I know they're not. - Supposing they are. - But they're not. Mr. Stewart, youdon't know Helen. But if you did, Imean you would see how silly all of this is. I mean, she couldn'tkeep a secret if her life depended on it. Whatever is on her mind comesstraight out of her mouth. I mean, she isexactly the opposite of what you're hinting at. I mean, she's open, andgenerous, and spontaneous. And Peter, he's sodistracted by his books that I don't think he's even realized that television's been invented. And these are thepeople that you suspect of being involvedin some kind of-- - Yeah, but Mrs. Jackson, try and see it fromour point of view. You saw Powellleaving their house. Now, doesn't that openup a lot of questions? Of course it does, and wemust answer those questions. - But what about Julie? She'll be awfully upset. She calls them AuntieHelen and Uncle Peter. She's very fond of them. - She loves them. - Well, surely there's no reason to trouble the child about this. - She's not a child, she's 16. - I mean, we'd haveto tell her something. Just say it'sa routine investigation. - A 24 hour watch, routine? - I'm sure that the twoof you will think of something to say to her. - Mr. Ellis, I don'tthink you understand. Helen and Peter areour best friends. - I do understand that. - No, but I mean we seethem almost every day. Helen especially, she'salways popping in. - You've told me. - Well, you can't expectme to go on talking to her and having cups of tea with her while I know someone's spyingon her from our bedroom. I can't do that. I can't. I won't. I'm sorry, I can't. - Well, I'm afraidthat you must try. - Why should I? - Because it's a questionof national security. - Well, it's a hell of athing to ask, you know. - I know. But I must insist. - Insist? - Earnestly request. - It's not fair. - I agree. But being fair hasa very low priority just at the moment,Mrs. Jackson. - What do you think? - You know what I think. We'll put anothertelephone in your bedroom. No bell, just alittle red light. And would you be theone to watch then, Mr. Stewart? No, no, no. We shall put intwo of our girls. - Palmer? - We shall do ourbest to make it as easy as possible for you. - If there was something wrong, if they were involved in some-- You thinkyou would've guessed. - I'd of felt somethinginstinctively. - Mrs. Jackson. People like Powelland his colleagues spend their livesdeceiving people like you. It's their job,their profession. And they do it with theutmost skill and conviction. If they didn't,they'd be finished. Why don't you try alittle of the melon, it's very good. - "Thank you very muchfor all your support." - Oh now, be reasonable. There was nothing I could do. - Well, you could'vesaid no, couldn't you? - Well, hardly. - You're always the samewith people like that. Just like your mom. - What? What about it? - Oh, that time wewent to visit her and her roof was leaking, you asked her why shedidn't tell the landlord, get him to fix it. She said, "I didn'twant to be any bother." - Yeah, so? - Well, it was alwaysthe same with her, "I don't want to be any bother." Even when she was ill and dying. I mean, she wouldn'tcall the doctor after six o'clockin the evening. Just lie in bed allalone and miserable. More afraid of being abother than anything else. When I think of howmuch that poor woman found to be afraid of, the landlord, thedoctor, the postman, the bus inspectors,anybody in a uniform, and now you and me,with Ellis and Stewart. - Ah, I see. - We were like schoolchildren standing in frontof their headmaster. - The fact that he hasthe legal authority-- - Oh, authority again! Do they have theauthority to make us lie to our daughter? We're not lying to her. - Well, we're nottelling her the truth. We've already toldher that we're having dinner with your boss. And now we're going tobe spying on our friends. - What if Helen and Peter are really involvedwith this matter? - Oh, don't be ridiculous. - Well, I never seethem at the weekends. Well, they work. - What, every weekend? - They do their accounts. And besides, they liketo be alone together. - Yes, but they aren'talone, are they? We've just heard that they'rewith this man, Powell. So why haven't they told us? - Well, do they expect us totell them everyone we see? - Yes, but the peoplewe see aren't criminals. - How do we know? And besides, justbecause they see him doesn't mean they'reinvolved with him. - All right, all right,if they're not involved, Stewart will find that out,they'll be the better for it. - Oh, I see. We're deceiving themfor their own good. Well, now that Iunderstand that, I feel much better. - Now, now, see, you're being-- - Please stop tryingto manipulate me. You, Stewart, Ellis, all of you, just stop it. - What makes you so certainthat Helen and Peter haven't been manipulating us? All of these years. I mean, what if they'vebeen our friends because it's beenconvenient for them? Because it servestheir purposes? - No. It's not possible. I can't believe that. I can't. - Do you want meto ring Stewart? Tell him we'vechanged our minds? Do you want me to do that? - It's too late, isn't it? Now we have to find out. Yes? - Mrs. Jackson? - Yes. - Hello, I'm Thelma. Mr. Stewart saidyou'd be expecting me. - Oh, yes, of course, come in. - He told me to usethe garden gate, I hope you don't mind. - Oh, not at all. This is the room thatMr. Stewart used. - He just moved thedressing table, didn't he? To get a better view? - Yes, he pushed it over there. - Now, the rest of theroom has got to stay as much the same aspossible, just in case. - Of what? - Security reasons. - Oh. Well, I'll just movea few personal things. - It's best to leaveeverything just the way it is. - I see. All right then. - Oh, let me giveyou a hand with that. - Oh, that's allright, I can get it. - No, I know it's inconvenient having to shift your bedrooms. - That's very kind of you. Now, I will have toget our night clothes out of that room. - Yeah, well that's all right, as long as you put them backfirst thing in the morning. - Oh yes, I see. - Don't feel you've got torun around after us, you know. I'll be bringing inme own sandwiches. - I see. - Now, that could be theman with the telephone. Yeah, it is. I told him to come to the back. Well, I hope you don't mind. - That's it. Just take it out of thesocket whenever you want. - Right. - You want it there? - Mm, fine. - Oh. - Oh, dear. Mrs. Jackson. - Yes? - I'm so sorry, Mrs. Jackson. This just got knocked off. Oh. - Not too precious, I hope. - Oh, just sentimental value. - Well, the department willreplace anything we damage, just send us the bill. - Yeah. Oh, well look, it canbe glued back together. See? It'll be all right. It'll be fine. - Hey, Barb! Barb. Hey. How you doing? - Good, and you? - Oh, fine I guess. I'm in the middle of one ofmy rare and famous attempts of cooking dinner. - Oh. Sounds exciting. - Well, we'll seewhat Peter says after I serve it to him tonight. - Yes. - Hi, Mrs. Duncan,how are you doing? So, how was last night? - Last night? - Yes, your eveningwith the boss. I saw you stepping out. - Oh. - He must've taken yousome place pretty fancy, you were really dressed up. How'd it go? - Oh, well, it was Bob's boss. - So, is there apromotion in the works? - Um, possibly. - Well great, 'cause I'vegot some very good ideas about how we couldspend his raise. Oh by the way, I'm startingan early Christmas list, now what do you think for Julie? - Oh, you mustn't bother. - Oh, it's no bother, andI get a kick out of it. I've got this great idea. One of those little sweatersets with the chain across, aren't those cute? - Oh yes, that would be lovely. Only it mustn't be extravagant. - Actually, oh all right, then I won't get herthe diamond tiara. Yes. Helen, we're having somespecial friends coming in a week from tomorrow, and, well, the thing is, knowthat your weekends are sacred and all that, but Bob and I were wondering if you couldn't make anexception this time. - Well, I wish thatwe could say yes. - You see, these arepeople that we particularly want you to meet. - Oh, and I know thatwe'd love to meet them, but why don't youinvite them over one night duringthe week we could. - But you see, Saturdayis the only day they can get away, they don't livearound here, you see. - Well, I really justdon't think we could. I can't get Peter to budge. - Oh, come on, Helen. You're not just a housewife,you're a person too. - Well, the truth is, I reallyenjoy this time with Peter. You know, during the weekhe's so tired and, well, thanks for the thought anyway. All right,Mrs. Schaefer. Anything special Icould do for you? Potatoes. Potatoes? - Well, I better be going in. Hello. - Mrs. Jackson, I'm Sally. Thelma and I are taking turns. - Oh. Yes, of course. It's straight throughhere, and up the stairs. - Yes, I know, Thelma'stold me all the layout. - She's cheerful, isn't she? - She's not here onthat sort of call. - Mom, can Maureen comeover tomorrow night? I've got a historytest on Friday, I thought we'd do somerevision upstairs in my room. You mean here? - Yeah, in my bedroom. - Oh no, I'm afraid not. - Why? - Well, what if Maureen wereto see Thelma, or this Sally? - Well, she wouldn'ttell anyone. - Mr. Stewart said nobodyis to know they're here. Not Maureen, not Malcolm,not any of the neighbors. - Well, not even Auntie Helen? - Especially not her. - Why especially? - Well, you knowhow Auntie Helen is. If it happens, shetalks about it. - Great, so now you're sayingI can't have any friends over. - Not while thisis going on, no. We can't take the risk. The risk of what? - Really, you know asmuch about it as I do. - Do I? Hasn't Mr. Stewart saidanything more to you? - Well, he saidwhatever he could. - Which is what? We're taking over your house, and you can't do anythingwithout our permission, and yes there's a verygood reason for it, we might just see some man walking along thestreet one day. - Julie, this is veryinconvenient for all of us, but it won't go on forever. - I don't believe you. - What do you meanyou don't believe me? - Well, you just sit there and let them takeover our lives. - I'm afraid I have no choice. - Don't you? - No, I don't! Do your homework. - What is it? - I'm sorry. - What are you doing,where are you going? - I'm just going to get asleeping pill, I can't sleep. I left it in the other room. - What time is it? It's the middleof the night, I'm afraid. - Turn it off! - Oh! - They could see me, thatcould ruin everything. - Sorry. Was theresomething you wanted? - No, no, that's all right. - Mom, what's going on? - Oh, nothing. What are you doing up? - Well, I just feel solocked up being in there, I keep wonderingwhat she's doing. - She's not doing a thing. She's sitting and staringout of our window. Let's go have some cocoa. - Oh, isn't that awful? - It's a stroke. - Yeah. He had one last year, didn't he? - Yeah. - Listen, I'll callthe hospital tomorrow and find out what the story is. Mrs. Duncan is gonnastay at the hospital, she might want someoneto run some errands, huh? Maybe make some phonecalls or, I don't know, check on the house. - Yes, well, thatsounds like a good idea. - It must be such aterrible thing, huh? - Awful. - Yeah. So, you coming toart class tomorrow? - Oh, I don't know. - Well, you missed the last one. You have to keep your hand in, you don't want tolose your nice touch. - Yes. Well, I'll try. - Oh, good! And then afterwardswe'll go to the pub and we'll have a nice chat. I miss you. - Really, why? - Well, because I'm used totalking to you after class. - Well, you couldtalk to other people. - Barb, you're justbeing mean today. - Well, your dresswill be ready soon. - Well, good. I can't wait to wear it. - And you'll have it inplenty of time for Christmas. - Hey Barb, are you all right? Really, you know, you look alittle greener on the gill, or something. - No, I just have aheadache, that's all. - Oh. - Well, let me take care of you. Come on, I'll fixyou a cup of tea. - No, I don't want acup of tea, thank you. You don't? How about an aspirin. - No, I've already taken one. - So? Take another one. - No, I don't want one. - Barbara, I seeyou have a headache, and I'm gonna help you. Now sit down. - Helen, come back downstairs! I know where the pillsare, I'll get them. - Oh, they're in your bedroom, I know this house likethe back of my hand. - Helen, please, will youlet me take care of myself? - Now look, Barb, it'slike my Aunt Sophie said, you take care of your friends, and they'll take care of you. - Helen! - Okay, now let mesee what you've got. - Aspirin. You take two of theseand a glass of water and you'll be ready toshake, rattle, and roll. Okay? Come here, Barbara, I'llgive you the glass of water. I want you to be betterfor art class tomorrow. And I want you totake two of these now and two of theselater, all right? You really do look pale. Think you might begetting the flu? Ugh, you're so clammy. Maybe I should callyour doctor for you.

Well, call me ifyou need anything. Julie! Hi, Julie! - Hi, Auntie Helen! - What's going on? You're standing outhere in the cold for the hell of it? - No, it's just-- - Oh, I get it. Our friend Malcolm, huh? Going for a littlespin on the forbidden? - Afraid so. - Ah, if your mom knew I knew. Well... How's she doing anyway? She was looking a little rocky the other day when I saw her. - I think what happened withMr. Duncan upset her a lot. I mean, we've knownthem since I was tiny. - Is that all? I mean, you all seemkinda down in the dumps. Even you, Julie. What's wrong? - Horrible, stupid,boring exams. - Well, you're not worriedabout those, are you? - No, I mean, I knowI'll pass and everything, it's just so boringto have to do them. - Oh yeah. There he is. - Hello, Malcolm! - Hi. I know who you are, you'reMalcolm Granger, aren't you? - Yeah. - This is my Auntie Helen. It's okay, she won't tell. - All right, off you go! Haven't you got a helmet? - Evening. - Can I take your coat? - No, no, no, no. Sorry to arrive without warning. - Now you don't drink, do you? - No I don't, no. - Can I offer yousomething else? - Well, grapefruit juice, yes, if you've got one, thank you. - Right. Orange juice? - Orange juice, yes. That'll be splendid, thank you. Now my girls tellme that your wife is becomingincreasingly unhappy. - Well, yes. - You should've told me before. There's not much I can do. You understand that, don't you? Of course you do,you're a sensible man. - Now look, I want toknow what is going on. - I've told you. - This is my house, andI have to know more. I have to. - Fair enough. The west have been developingsome underwater weapons. Very effective, very secret. Russia wants toknow where they are, and how they work. They've sent spies to find out. Powell is in chargeof this operation. Now he's a very important man, make no mistake about that. Almost certainly ahigh ranking officer in the KGB. Soviet intelligence. - The KGB? I thought you saidthis wasn't dangerous. It's not. - Well I mean,what about Barbara? And Julie? They're here on theirown most of the time. I mean, what happens ifthis man gets suspicious, or panics, or something! - There'll be no violence, I can assure you of that. The KGB don't send whole liaison on an operation like this. - How can you be sure on that? Because I am. - Well, how can you be? - Because it's my job to be, and I'm good at my job. It's like bird watching. You know, whenyou're bird watching, you get to watch theintimate details, the habits, the markingsof your favorite species. Well, that's what I'm doing when I'm watchingpeople involved withRussian intelligence. I get to know theirhabits, and their markings. I know how they operate. - But isn't it asecret organization? I mean, how can you? - You'd be surprisedwhat you can find out if you try hard enough. I know more aboutthe KGB chairman than I do about mynext door neighboor. Alexander Nikolayevich Shelepin. I know what heeats for breakfast. I know he has apiano in his flat, I know he has realscotch in his sideboard, and I know where he works. It's a harmless lookingbuilding in Jajinski Square, but behind thatbuilding is a courtyard, and in that courtyardis Lubyanka Prison. Hundreds of people havedied there, thousands. He's got an officeon the third floor. And from his window, he canlook down on the Marx Prospect, and he can see the peoplehurrying down the street. Now, he's in control of thosepeople, and he knows it, and they know it too. - And what streetdoes your office look down on, Mr. Stewart. - There is a difference. Shelepin's control is absolute. I can only request. But I repeat, there isabsolutely no danger to you and your family. - What about Helen and Peter? Are they part of this? - Well, I'm afraid there'sno doubt about that now. Ah, they've been inthis game a long time. They started off inAmerica in New York. They called themselvesthe Yelens then. They were about to bearrested by the FBI. Well, they must'vesensed something, because suddenly theydisappeared without a trace. Now there they are, living across the road from you, back to their old trade. - Look, can't youleave the house now? You and your people? - No. - Well, why can't you? I mean, if you know it all. - Knowing is not the sameas catching, Mr. Jackson. I've been on thiscase a long time. I want to see itthrough to the end. - That's Barbara. I don't think she could cope if she knew aboutHelen and Peter. - Then perhaps itwould be better if she were not told. Mrs. Jackson. Christmas shopping? - Mr. Stewart. - I just dropped in to seeif everything's all right. I trust that it is. - I thought the girlswere to be gone last week. - Well, no, I'm terribly sorry. - First it was you for two days, then it was thegirls for a week, which turned into two weeks. Now I can't rememberwhat it's like not to have them here. How much longer? - It's a verydelicate situation. I mean, we can't makeany firm promises. I'm sorry. - I don't think youunderstand what it's like. Every time I see Helen,every time she comes around, I feel quite ill. I can't sleep. - Oh, I'm sorry. - You must've known itwould take this long, you could've told us. - Well, we never know howlong these jobs will take. We have to tread very wobbly. - How do you mean? - Well, one false move, and we might frighten them away. - Frighten who away? - Mrs. Jackson. As you know, Powell is engaged in an espionage conspiracy. Quite to what extent, of course, we don't know, we're notsure, we have no proof. - Oh, I do begyou to be patient. Now, all we have todo is keep on watching for a little longer. - But do you meanwatching Powell, or watching Helen and Peter? - I mean watchingeveryone who has been in regular contact with him. Everyone, and anyone. Ah, I must be off. I am sorry, Mrs. Jackson. It's easy to say, I know, but I do mean it. Goodbye, I'll see myself out. - What did he come here for? - God knows. Did hesay anything to you? - No, no, nothing special. You know what he's like, hm? I'll make you a cup of tea, do you want a cup of tea? - No. Thank you. And now we have timefor just one more sound... - Yes? - I'm off now. Gonna try and get someChristmas shopping done. That's nice. Who's it for? - Helen, actually. I promised to make hera dress for Christmas. - I wish I was like that. Clever with my hands. Well, see you tomorrow. Thanks again forthe lovely lunch. - Thelma? Is there any news? - News? - Nobody tells us anything. - Nothing, as far as I know. - Mr. Stewart came tosee us the other night. - Yes? - Did you know he was coming? - Well, yes. - You didn't say anything. I suppose he told you not to. Did he? Has he said anything to you about Helen and Peter? Is there anything I should know? Are they in somekind of trouble? - I really couldn't say. - The thing is, you'rein our home, our bedroom. - I'm sorry, I do tryto keep out of the way. - Oh no, you've beenawfully considerate. It's just that it'sbeen weeks now, and we know nothing more thanyou did when you first came. I think you ought to, don't you? - It's not my placeto express an opinion. But youhave one, don't you? - I'm not in a position to. - Do you think it'sall right to just let everything go on this way? - Mrs. Jackson, if therewas anything I could do, then I would do it. - But there is, andyou're not doing it! - I'm home, Mom! I'll just put the kettle on. - Yes. - I better be going. The shops will be packed. - Thelma, I'm sorry, Iknow it's not up to you. - It really isn't. I'll see you tomorrow. - Yes, tomorrow. Night, Julie. Night. Oh, Julie,there's something I've been meaning to tell you. I've got a spare helmetyou can borrow if you like. What? I mean, youreally shouldn't ride around on the back of those things without wearing a helmet. - Julie! - He was only givingme a ride home. How manytimes have we told you? - Yes, I know! - How many times? Yes, I'm sorry! - You promised! You gave me your word. - I'm not a child anymore. - What do you mean by that? Well, I'm oldenough to take care of myself. - That motorbike is dangerous. - No, it's not! Auntie Helen said that-- - Auntie Helen said what? - Nothing. - What? - Well, she said if I took care, it'd be okay. - What has it gotto do with her? - Well, nothing. - You will do as I say! Do you hear me? You will do as I say, and you will neverlie to me again. Never! - Who's that? - I'll go and see. Barbara. Is Helen here? Yeah sure, go on in. - Hi, Barb. I'm glad you came over, I'm-- - Helen, I'm angry,and I'm hurt. I've just had adreadful row with Julie about the motorbike. - What about the motorbike? - She said that yousaid it was all right if she took care. - Well, I was only tryingto tell her to be careful. - I don't want herriding that bike, and she knows it,and you know it. And thanks to you, shedeliberately deceived me, she lied to me. - Now listen, Barbara. I certainly didn'ttell her to lie to you. - Well, what do youthink she understood when you told her to take care? That's her Auntie Helen,giving her permission to do something she knowsshe's not meant to do. - Yeah, you're right. You're right. It was dumb. Okay, now,let's see what we can do to put this right. - The way to put it rightwas not to have done it in the first place. - I'm sorry. I really am, it willnever happen again. I promise you that, ever. - Thank you. - Would you like a cup of tea? - No, I said whatI came here to say. We won't refer to it again. - So take your coat off,sit down, relax, stay. - No thanks, I havemore wrapping to do. I'll just say goodnight. I'll see you out. Thank you. I'm sorry to makesuch a fuss, Peter. Don't apologize,Barbara, you were right. Oh, hang on. - I've got to talk to Barbara. Mm, mince pies, huh? Well, Christmas wouldnot be Christmas without your mince pies. Oh, Barbara, I couldjust kick myself. You know, the last thingin the world I wanted to do was to start troublebetween you and Julie. It seems like wheneverI talk to Julie, I let her sway metoo much, you know? You can imagine whatkind of a mother I would've made, I probably would'veraised the biggest bunch of spoiled brats theworld has ever known. So I'm sorry. I'll shape up, I promise. Well, I guess this means Idon't get my dress either, huh? - Oh. Thanks for reminding me. Excuse me a minute. Merry Christmas. - Well, thank you. I can't wait to wear it. - Well, I really betterget back to my baking. - Wow. You really are madat me, aren't you? - No, I'm not mad at you. - No? Then why the chill? - Well, I'm just very busy. - I know you, Barb. I mean, aren't weeven friends anymore? - Oh, what a silly thing to say. I'm not an idiot, I know when I'mbeing frozen out. - Well, I can'timagine what you mean. - "Well, I can'timagine what you mean." What kind of stick figuretalk is that anyway? - Well, I'm sorry,it happens to be the way that I speak. - Barbara, what thehell is going on? - I just have to getthese in the oven. - Look, would youjust look at me when I'm talking to you? - Yes. Oh, that was astupid thing to do. I'm all right, I'mall right, please. - I've never seen you so jumpy. - I was juststartled, that's all. - Well, you should dress that, put some ointmenton it or something. - It's fine. I can hardly feel it. See? It's all right. - I can't believe thisis all just about Julie. I mean, this has beengoing on for weeks. Really, Barbara, if thiswas me doing this to you, you wouldn't stand for it. Now, I know that there'ssomething bothering you. Come on, Barb. Really? Is there something thatyou want to tell me? There is, there is somethingthat you want to tell me, isn't there? Yes. Go ahead. You know you can tell me. Whatever it is, you can tell me. You can tell me anything. It's just me, Helen. Please Barbara, tell me,what is bothering you? Go ahead. - Bob and I have... Um... Been having problems. - What? - When he comes homeat night, I'm not here. - But that doesn'thappen that often. - More than he's used to. - You mean, the art classes? Spending time with me? - Yes. Yes, he needs to have someattention paid to him too. - But he can't be upsetthat you have interests, I mean, that you'redoing things. If it makes you happy, how can he be upset? - Helen, you'veasked me to tell you, and I've told you. - I see. Well... I'm sorry, Barbara. I go overboard sometimes,I've done this before. I see that I've reallymessed thing up now, and it's up to me tostraighten them out somehow. - No. Really, you've been very sweet, but there's nothingfor you to do, just, you know, takeit a little bit easier. - Take it a little bit easier. Just a little bit. - Yes, well, we'llget through Christmas, and we'll fix this, we will. Now there. Wasn't I right tomake you tell me this? Everything's gonna be all right. - Well... I better get backto my baking now. - Yes, well, takecare of your hand. - I will. And don't forget your present. - Oh, right, right. Thanks. - Malcolm! Malcolm!- Go on! Come on! - Unit Two, testing,are you receiving me? Unit Tworeceiving you, poor reception. - Unit Three, testing,you receiving me? UnitThree receiving you,strength positive. - Mr. Jackson. I'm sorry to disturbyour Saturday but... Ah, Mr. Jackson, yes, Ithought you'd both like to know that it's nearly over. Powell will be here shortly. He'll go straight tothe Schaefers house, and of course, weshall arrest him. - But what aboutHelen and Peter? - Yes. We shall be picking them up too. That is the plan. - Yes, yes! Oh! - You still haven't toldus what they've done. - They're Powell'stransmitting station. He brings them information, and they send it directto the KGB headquarters. Either in books,posted by Mr. Schaefer to fictitious clients atvarious parts of Europe, or presumably by radio. I'm sure we'llfind a transmitter in that house oftheirs somewhere. I'm sorry to put it to youso bluntly, Mrs. Jackson, but I'm afraid there's no longer any doubt at all. Your friends arecommunist agents with many years ofexperience behind them. And they're Americans, bythe way, not Canadians. - Americans? You mean, she's notfrom a farm in Canada? - No, there's nofarm, I'm afraid. There's no Aunt Sophie either. I wish there wassomething I could do to soften the blow. - You know what I wish. I wished you'd never come here. I'm sure. - I wish you'd neverset foot in this house. - Now let's not startblaming Mr. Stewart, it's not his fault. - I mean, Helen mayhave lied to us, but you've gone onebetter, you've made us lie. We've even lied toour own daughter. - I'm sure she'll realizethat you were just doing your best to protect her. - Oh please, stopmaking excuses! People like you canalways make excuses for everything, itjust makes me feel ill. - Now come pn, there's nopoint in upsetting yourself. - I'm not upsetting myself! Let's face it. I've betrayed Helen, justas much as she betrayed me. - Oh now, come on, Barbara, let's not forgethow this started. Helen and Peter camehere pretending to be what they weren't. That's where the betrayal began. Pretending to be our friends. - Weren't they our friends then? Was even that alie, our friendship? - I'm sure that wasperfectly genuine, there's no reason to doubt that. - No reason? There's every reasonto doubt everything she's ever said or done. I've never had many friends. Not close friends, notwhat you'd call close. I mean, Helen, she couldbe loud, and tactless, and overwhelming, but my God, I loved her. Unit Four here. Test Four, guvnor, receiving. - Receiving, Unit Four. Make sure you stay in that tent. You must try notto judge yourself too harshly, Mrs. Jackson. I mean, it won'tdo anyone any good, and least of all, yourself. - What will happen to them? - Well, they'llbe sent for trial, and imprisoned, I suppose. Now I'm sorry to giveyou so much pain, but there's reallynothing I could do. Unit Three,approaching position, sir. - Acknowledged, Unit Three. Nothing I can do. Absolutely nothinganybody could do. - You could'vetold us the truth. You knew about Helen andPeter before you came here. Why couldn't you tell us? - I had to be careful. You might've warned them. - Well, what makesyou think I won't now? - Well-- - If I were braveenough, I would. If I were brave enough, I'vego over there to that door, bang on it, and say get out,get out, get out, get out! - Mr. Stewart, Mrs. Schaefer'scoming across the road. - Yes, yes, we know. - Listen, we don't haveto answer the door. - Yes you do, becauseyour car's outside, and she knows you're here. Central to all units,Central to all units. I'm going off the air. Repeat, off the air. Oh, hi, Bob. Hi. How are things on yourside of the street? Oh, sunny, sunny. Is Barbara home? No, no,actually she's not, she's just went down theroad to borrow something. Will she be back soon? - Uh, not right now,I'm not sure of it. Shall I get herto give you a ring when she comes back? Or you can leave a message. - Oh, no, actually see, Iwanted to show her something. - Oh. Well, like I say, she's not... - She's not here. Well, you know, it'sno great secret, I just want toshow her the dress. - Oh, you'rewearing a new dress. - Yes, yes. This is the dress thatBarbara made for me, see? - Yes, I remember. - I just wantedto show it to her. You know, how it turned out. So? - Well, you know me, I don'tnotice this sort of thing. - Oh, Bob. Well... You know, Bob, aslong as we're alone, I wonder if I could talkto you about something. Yes, sure. What about? - You know, I get it fromBarbara that you might feel, that I've been, well,monopolizing her, or I don't know, gettingin the way, or something. - In the way? Of what? - Oh, between you and her. - Barbara said that? - Not exactly, but I thinkthat's what she meant. You know, art classes,our little excursions. That it was bothering you. - Yes, I know, I understand. - Because, really, Iwould be very sorry to ever do anything like that. - No, no, I understand, and I appreciate your feelings. - Oh, good. I just wanted to getthat off my chest. So... You don't mind ifI wait, do you? - For Barbara? - Well, you sayshe'll be back soon. - Yes. Well, maybe. Oh. I have so much Christmasshopping left to do. Expensive time. - There she is. Well, hi, Barb. - Helen's come overto show you the dress. - You opened it early. - Yes. I couldn't wait 'til Christmas. It turned out allright, didn't it? I mean, it's a littletight right here, but you could fixthat, couldn't you? It looks okay, doesn't it? - Lovely. - Barb, what is it? - She's not feeling her best. - What's wrong? - Well, she's notbeen sleeping well. Why don't you go andhave a lie down, my love. - I don't want to lie down. Just leave me alone. Well, there you are. You could see what it's like. I think it might bebetter if you went. - Well, okay. Is that what you want, Barbara? You want me to go? - Yes please. Go, go, please! - Listen, don't say anythingyou'll be sorry for. - Well, why wouldshe say anything that she would be sorry for? Now what's going on here? Something is going onhere, isn't it, isn't it? Yes. Now, I want you totell me what it is. Come on, Barb. You can tell me, what is it? We've never had any secretsbetween us, have we? - Haven't we? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Bob's right, perhaps Ibetter just lie down. I really thinkit would be better if you went now, Helen. Now please, come on. - I'll check backwith you later. - Aunt Helen, please! - Central to all, over. Any developments, Unit One? Negative. - Unit Two. Negative. - Unit Three, you're in positionat the back of the house, can you see it? Yes, sir. I'm going upstairs. - Want me to come with you? - No, thank you. - No, we're standingby here, sir. Okay, where is he now? What's his ETA at this location? Right, I will. Right. UnitTwo to central. Main suspectentering the street. - Central to all mobiles. Main suspect on way to house. Unit Three, stand ready. Central to all units. Wait for my signal. Unit Four, it's all yours. All units. Go! Sally? They need us over there now. Coming! - Dad? Dad. What's happening overat Auntie Helen's house? There's police everywhere. - Yes, I know. They've been arrested. - Arrested? - I'm sorry, Julie, thisis difficult to understand. They were the people thatMr. Stewart's been watching. - Auntie Helen and Uncle Peter? - They were workingfor the Russians. - But Powell,Stewart said that-- - Yeah, he's a spy. They were working for him. - I don't believe it. You knew, didn't you? Both of you. You knew what Stewartwas doing all along. Why didn't you sayanything to me? Why? - Oh, Julie. - How could you? They're our friends,our friends! - You okay? - Yeah. I feel a little bit scared. - Sit over there. And you sir, sit right there. - Hi, Julie. - Hello, Auntie Helen. They have this rule,if you're under 18, you have to have someone older to come and visit. Malcolm volunteered. Now that I'm here, Idon't know what to say. - Why did you come? What happened there, Julie? - I didn't know what wasgoing on, Auntie Helen. They didn't tell me. All they said that theywere looking for some man who came and visited sometimes. Then one day I got home, and you and UnclePeter were gone. It was all so sudden. I didn't get a chanceto say anything to you. - Well, what didyou want to say? - Goodbye, I suppose. Since then I'vejust kept thinking who it is I thought I'dbe saying goodbye to. I mean... I thought you weremy Auntie Helen who grew up on a farm in Canada, and had an Aunt Sophie. And then I find out you're not. You're not a lot ofthings you said you were, and I couldn't helpfeeling stupid. - What I feel about youJulie, has always been real. Is that what you want to know? I've missed you. I miss Peter. They don't let ussee each other. I don't regret what I did. We believed in it. - Mom hasn't been very well. - No? She hasn'tbeen the same since. - Well, who has? Oh, all that time. Your mother... In and out of yourhouse, your kitchen. That dress. Oh, I did sense thatsomething had changed toward the end, but the possibilitythat your mother could knife me in the back, it never really occurred to me. She really had mefooled, didn't she? I'll never forgive her for that. Never. - Hello, Mom. - You've been gone all day. - I was visiting a friend. - Only one I know. - No. Oh, Mom, your tea's cold. - Is it? Shall Imake you another? - No, love. Don't make a fuss. A fewweeks after that, Mom died of a heart attack. She once told me that shethought of Helen every night before she went to sleep. Every night, I suppose,until she died.
