Let me get my bag. - Okay, okay. - Abami? - Mm? - Someone's looking for you. - Ah. - -Ah, ah… Ah, ah… - Sam, Sam! - What's up? Ah, ah, I see you now. - What's up? - Here's the material I promised you. Don't be angry. I forgot we had that tutorial. It's fine. I'm not angry. I mean, if you want to fail Dr. Dede's course again, it's your party. There's no need for that, now. I had this gig tonight. Calm down. - Mm-hmm. Sam, I said I understand. I mean, a gig is so much more important than a tutorial that will help you avoid another carryover. You owe me 30 bucks for that printout. Bye! Oh! Almost forgot. My mom gave me this letter to give you from your mom. Take it now. Come on. I hope to see you at the next fellowship. - Yeah. - Sam! - Mm? - Fellowship. I'll come. Bye. - Tej! - Mm? Do we still have that test tomorrow? Sam, Sam, Sam… Guy, please wake up. Help me zip up, please. This girl… Where are you going to this early morning? Uh-uh. - Are you jealous? - Jealous about? Calm down, silly. Hope you know that all your goods, they belong to me? Please… I'm going to hustle. We need to pay our band. The gate fee we get isn't enough. Hustler! That's me! - I'll be back in the evening. - Mm. Mm. Mm. Try not to miss me, yeah? It'll be hard, but try. Bad girl! That's me. Number one. - -See you. - -Oh shit. Mama… My dear son, I don't know if you've been getting my letters. I am sending this one through Deaconess Ajayi's daughter. Samuel, my son, it's been almost three years since you have come home. - -You and your devil music! There's a way that seems right to a man and the end thereof is destruction! Never again! Never! I miss you, my son. Please, come home. But seriously, did you find the test difficult? I… You don't study. You need to stop cheating off me. - Who said I haven't studied? For what now? Please, be on your way. I'll see you later. Are you sure? Get out! Bye. A-student! Babes! I've been waiting inside this car for over ten minutes. Sorry, now. Ah-ah. Mm! Dr. Dede wants to kill us with tests this semester. Stop lying. It's not Dr. Dede. So it was Dr. Dede you were talking to for over ten minutes? Get out, please. What does that girl want? She keeps following you everywhere like a fly. What is it? She's my friend. Calm down. - Your friend? - You know. She just wants... Really? Wants me to go to fellowship. She wants to save your soul? - You? I die! I die! My guy, she wants to fuck out your destiny, not save your soul. Go and fuck her. Give her something good, quick. Take her to a corner. She'll leave you alone. - I swear, I hate you. I love you too. Joy! We're going to be late for fellowship again. - Teju, I'm so sorry. - Mm. Mm. I hope I'm not late for Rapture because of you. You can never be late for Rapture. Never. - We still have to freshen up. - I know. So, tell me about the boy you wanted to invite. - The family friend? - Mm-hmm. Ugh, he's not coming. Thank you all for coming. As I close this service, may God continue to always bless you. Amen. I'll see you next week. - Hey, Teju. - Ugh. Where are you rushing to? I promised my friend I'd go for their social night. - Social night? - Yes. You know what happens at those places. You can't go alone. - No, it's okay. - No, I'm coming with you. - Ugh. - Oh! Baby, I'm coming. Samuel! This is never going to work for you. You are a Covenant Child. You are a Covenant Child. Never call me that again. There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is destruction. I'm not a Covenant Child! Sam. - Teju. - You didn't think I would come, did you? - Did you? - Ah-ah. Don't you see me standing here? I didn't see you in the crowd. How am I sure you didn't come in after the concert ended? - How dare you? - We were here, right on time too. Right? Sam, this is my beautiful friend, Joy. - Joy. - Mm-hmm. Why are you smiling? I don't know, if someone pointed you out in the crowd and asked me to guess your name, I'd have said "Joy." Why is that? What makes me a "Joy"? I can't tell. But there's just… something. - Sam. - Teju. I'm here to confirm that our deal is still on. I agreed to come to your show. Now you agreed to come to our next prayer meeting. - -Mm-hmm. Anyway, Joy Obah, it's getting late. Let's go. Hey, hey, hey… Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Joy Obah? - Mm-hmm. Two more syllables to yours and you have my last name. - What? - Really? Will you be at the fellowship? Hey, Reks! Okay, so, um, Teju... - Teju and Joy. - Let's… Yeah. Whatever. I bought fuel, let's go home. All right, let's bounce. Can you imagine? Oh, my God! We have made it, my guy! Remember a deal I told you about a few weeks ago? [Sam] Um… - Sorry, which one? The repackaged drugs one. - Eh? - My guy, I just got a supplier now. All we need to do is just deliver to those chemists, then we take our cut. - Get it? - How much? In two months, you can make up to one million naira. - That's a lie. - I swear. Know what we can do with that money? We can leave this dirty hostel and buy a new car. Plenty of things! Let's enjoy life! Reks! Criminal! That's me. - Number one! - Of course! - Go-getter! The baddest! - Yes! - Give me your cigarette, let me smoke - Take, take, take. Ah-ah. - Hoo! A lion doesn't give birth to a goat. I don't have parents, I have to hustle. My sister, I don't judge you. Who's your sister? After proper love-making, you'll know I'm not. - It's you and I. - Ah. - -Abami! Abami! - What do you mean? - Be on time. Yes! Yo, Teju. What's up? You're missing too many classes. Look… Didn't know we had class. Well, if you were at the last one, you would know about this one. See? That Rekya girl, she's a bad influence on you. Leave Rekya out of this. She and I are close. Why are you giving me attitude? What's wrong with you? 'Cause I didn't come to fellowship? No. But why did you miss it? I'm busy. I have gigs. I have rehearsals to plan. I'm hustling. I promise, next one, I'll come. Really? - You prom... For real, really? - I promise. Ooh! - But only one condition. - What? Give me Joy's room number. - Please! - Joy? Yes. Teju! Teju, now! ♪ Hey, Joy girl! ♪ Sam? She remembers me! I'm surprised you remember me. You're the most unforgettable person in the world. Story. Hop in. Let me drop you off. I don't know. Please come. I won't bite. I promise. Uh… Would you like me to change the music? Uh… Why? Because I'm a Christian, I can't listen to Fela? Well, do you? Yes! My dad was actually a radio man for several years. He worked at FRCN, and he had so many LPs. - Interesting. - Mm-hmm. We even used to have this big old thing in our living room, a radiogram. We used to have one. That radiogram became my personal property at some point. I would listen to record after record. - Jimmy Cliff, the Everly Brothers… …Skeeter Davis, Christy Essien-Igbokwe, Oliver De Coque. - Oliver De Coque? - Mm-hmm! You don't look like someone who's into all that old stuff. Oh, I listen to everything. I love music. I don't really have a good singing voice, but I like to torture them with special numbers at the fellowship from time to time. But, you know, the Bible did say you can make a joyful noise to the Lord. Oh… But my dad, he has a marvelous voice. - -Man… I'm in trouble. I inherited… I can't even breathe properly just looking at this girl. - She's not even my spec. - But I remember… So skinny. Yet I'm losing my mind over her. He was telling stories… Jesus, what am I going to do? - I'm fucked. - …Michael Jackson. - Fucked! - Yeah. - Michael Jackson? - Yes. - -He interviewed Michael Jackson. - You're lying. - I'm telling you! Ah… I think it was, actually, maybe, when he had just released "Bad," or maybe it might have been… Hey, Joy… this might sound crazy, but, um… I like you very much. Like, very, very much. Sam… Thank you for the ride, but I have to go. Wait, hold on. I know this may be all so sudden, you know? But… I feel like there's something, you know? And it's even, like, frightening for me, the… "bad guy," "bad boy." You're not a bad guy, Sam. You know what? Let's be friends. For now. I'd be cool with us being friends. Would you do that for me?

Why're you punishing her? - I'm not punishing her. - Then reply. She's worried about you. She doesn't want my letters, Rekya. She wants me! She wants me to come back home. I can't go back. I thought you understood. I don't understand, though. I told her to forget about me. Or that she never gave birth to me. What? - Because I'm even dead. You joking? I'm not the son she prayed for. She named me "Samuel." - Rekya, Samuel! - Uh-huh. Do you know who Samuel is? A biblical prophet. That's not me. And that will never be me. Sam, do you have any sense? You listening to what you're saying? Your mother should pretend you're dead? Are you joking? For what? Why can't you just pretend to be what they want you to be? Will it kill you?

Or should I say, Brother Abami? You and I both know that that boy is no brother of yours. - But you've been hanging out with him... - He's just a friend. Friend? The Bible says in the book of James 4:4 that friendship with the world is enmity with God. A boy who smokes, drinks, womanizes, and performs the devil's music at worldly gatherings? That's someone you call your friend? Uh… Pastor BJ… I don't know what you think is going on, - but I'm just trying to... - Save him? Sister Joy, do you know who that boy is? What do you mean? Have you ever heard of Prophet Josiah Obalolu? My mom used to watch his TV services. Samuel is his first son! That boy is a total disgrace to his father's name. - And pain in his mother's heart. He was brought up in the ways of the Lord. But ever since he came to this university, he has totally forgotten the Lord. That is someone you want to save? All he's going to do is pull you from the light into darkness. Focus on the Lord, Sister Joy. - Focus on the Lord. - Hey! Pastor BJ! Babes. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Babes, what's wrong? Sam… I can't meet you again. Why? I don't understand. Meet me how? I didn't know you were Prophet Josiah Obalolu's son. So? So? You didn't tell me! Why did I need to tell you?

Yes, of course. - It's such a pleasure to meet you. - It's nice to meet you too, Pastor Zach. This has been such a surprise for me and all of us graduating students. - God is good. - The work she's done... - And, oh, of course, Brother Sam. - I'm Sam. Uh, hi. Nice to meet you, brother. - Thank you. - Is it okay if she shows me around? Ah, but of course! Please show Pastor Zach around while I make the final preparations. - You don't mind? - Yes, I don't. - I hope you don't mind. - No. Not at all. - Wonderful. - We can make our way. Ah, thank you very much, our wonderful choir, for that amazing ministration. - -Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Now, brothers and sisters, the moment we have all been waiting for is here. And I will need you all to get up on your feet because we need to show him what we're made of in Amazing Grace Fellowship. - Yes! - Now, with a resounding applause, let us make welcome our guest speaker for today, all the way from Abuja, Pastor Zach Agu. Praise God, somebody! Praise the Lord! - Hallelujah! - Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, thank you. Keep it coming! Keep it coming! Yes! - Somebody say, "God is good." - God is good! - Say, "God is good all the time." - God is good all the time. I had so much fun. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Hey, but what did you think about that fake pastor? Pastor Zach? How is he a fake pastor? I don't know. I just could see through his fake acts. "Coulda, woulda, shoulda…" I mean, who talks like that, you know? Uh, I… I didn't notice. Mm. Whatever. It's fine. Tonight is about you and I. Okay? I'm gonna miss you, Sam. I'll miss you too. But… I know we'll see each other soon. Hey, I got you a gift. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Come here. - Sam! Every time you wear it, I want you to know that you have my heart. Always. You're beautiful. It's been four months. Four months of sending her emails, writing her countlessly. She's not replied once. - It's like I'm going crazy or something. - Ah! Don't say that. You're not going crazy, in Jesus' name. Ah, but, Brother Sam, uh, correct me if I'm wrong, the last time we had this conversation, you made me understand that you guys had been in touch. - What's up with that? - I lied. Eh, but, please, anything you have, number, address, what... I just need to contact her. I can't keep living like this. Please. Eh? Brother Sam, the first few months of Youth Service is always very challenging and tough. Give me a few days. I'll ask one of the sisters in the church. I'm not giving you any guarantees. But if they've heard something, I will let you know, okay? Thank you. - It's okay, Sam. - Don't forget. It's okay. Remain blessed, Brother Sam. Where is Joy? Excuse me? You've been avoiding me. You still don't know? I'm going to be upfront with you. Joy is married. What? Joy is married. Hey! Listen, listen, Brother Sam, I can't help you with this. Who she marry? Who did she marry?! Zach? Ha! I messed up! Listen, listen, Brother Sam, Brother Sam, it's obvious Pastor Joy has moved on with her life. Do the same, and find Christ while you're at it. Fuck you! Black sheep. Sam! Sam, can you hear me? What? Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Wake up! Are you okay? Sam? Teju… - Oh, Sam… It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. - Okay. - You got it? Let me see. The answer is… You got it! Well done. You got it. Stop it! Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, for waking us up this morning. Thank you, Lord, for allowing us to get to and from our destination safely. Thank you, Lord, for protecting us. In the mighty name of Jesus, Lord God, we thank you. We thank you for this Sunday service. We thank you for allowing us to get here safely. Allow the Spirit to move within my husband... Mr. and Mrs. Obalolu. - I will marry. - Guy, you're playing with me? - You're playing with me! - Is that how sweet marriage is? You look good. - How are you? - Fine. Uh… - Reverend wants to see you. - Reverend? What's she want? Don't know, but you need to hurry up. Service is about to start, all right? Good morning. Minister Sammy! Yes, Ma? Bishop's chair? Sorry, Ma. Are you mad? There has been concerns about the song you have been singing. - Not spiritual enough... - Not spiritual enough? Let me finish! What song do you want to sing today? It's an original song. Can't you people sing simple Nigerian praise songs? But… we perform Nigerian praise songs. That is another problem. "Perform!" That is so carnal and disgusting! Minister Sam, we don't pay you a fat salary for you to dress fancy and ridiculous. We pay you to lead us into the presence of God. Please, change the song. Ahem, Minister Sammy, before you glide back, remove those things from your neck. It is too shiny and it's entering the eyes of girls. - Before you minister. Do you hear me? - Somebody say, "Yeah!" - Yeah! ♪ He be the god Of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ♪ ♪ He be the lion for the people of Judah ♪ ♪ Jehovah-jireh ♪ ♪ Jehovah-nissi ♪ ♪ Elohim, Adonai Jehovah-shammah ♪ - It was amazing. - I know. - I felt the Spirit in todays' service. - And the song. - Yes! - In fact, I need to speak to Sam. - Well, he's... he's over there. - I know. - Later. - Thank you. Sammy? Um, Reverend wants to see you. - Mm-hmm? - Yeah. What does Reverend want? She want my blood? Ah-ah! Leave these girls alone. So you don't get exposed. I can't take it anymore. It took every ounce of self-control in me not to punch that bitch in the face. - Ah, Samuel… - You're not listening, and you never have! When it comes to church, you don't care! Eh? You don't have to deal with her as a boss. Three years? Three years of dealing with that bullshit! Samuel, the kind of language that comes out of your mouth sometimes… That woman is an anointed woman of God. - You have to be careful. - Anointed, my ass. Jesus! Samuel! See, Teju, you know me. You know my story. Three years ago, when you told me to do this church music director bullshit, I told you I don't like church business. Well, actually, you tell me every single day, actually. - Every day, you tell me. - Good. So, now I'm telling you for the last time. This time for real. I'm not going back there. I'm sorry. - -Okay, so then what are you going to do? Anything. We'll figure out something. Anything's better than that church thing. Samuel… Teju, please, let me have my afternoon nap. Mm, Sam, Sam… Samuel… - Are you listening? - I already know what you'll say. - Are you listening? - Hmm? - I'm listening. Six months. - Six... - Just stick with it. Just another six months. Between now and... and December, that's it. You can use the time to plan and to think about what you want to do. Save, a new business… Just... Just six months. - Mm? - Six months? Six months. Just plan before that time I don't take a gun and put one in her head. Sam, you can't say that kind of stuff. Samuel… Marrying you was the best decision I ever made. Really? Yeah. Really. Stop! Joy? I did it, Sam. I left Zach. It was a mistake leaving you and marrying him. Biggest mistake of my life. But, what about Teju? Shh. She's gone too. Oh, Joy… Mwah! Good morning, baby. Let me go make you some breakfast. Hmm? Some of you have been in this church for more than five years. Yet there's nothing to show for it in your lives. - You are a disgrace to the body of Christ. Yes! When we tell you what works, you say "no", you will do it your own way. "Sow seed." "No." "Pay your tithes." "No." "Give to the building project." - "No." How can the work of God go forward without your money? No! Yet you want God to bless you. - Guy… …it is time. Time for what? It's time to clean up. I am asking all of you. Are you a fool? Are you a fool? Somebody, praise the Lord. Church business is big business now, my brother. - Bigger than oil and gas. - What can we say? - Amen to Jesus. - Amen! Thanks, everyone, for your contribution towards the success of today's service. We recognize and we appreciate what you do towards ensuring that the work of God is advanced in this assembly. And guess what? God Almighty recognizes you too. That is why we should strive for better, so that our God will be further glorified. Amen? Amen! - Amen. - Eh, Mummy? Um… Like the Bishop has already said, we appreciate you people. Um… The only problem is there are things we have spoken about in the past that are still cropping up today. Yes. It's as if you people are dense on purpose. Why are you looking at yourselves like that? Don't make me angry today. Yes! Sound people, it's as if you people are demonic. Yes! I mean, all throughout the message today, there was one whining sound coming out from one of the speakers. - Daddy, didn't you hear it? - Mm-hmm. Eh. We pay you people a lot of money, and yet, we cannot preach God's words without one demon crying from one of the speakers. - Mama, it's not... We're not... - Excuse me, let me finish. Minister Sammy thinks I am funny. I've become a comedian. Right? I am, uh… What is that comedian? Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. - I'm sorry, Ma. - Ah, you're sorry? You are not sorry. I have given you a long rope, and you will soon hang yourself with it. Yes. Look at yourself. He thinks he's… he's Michael Jackson, dressing very carnal. Please. You people should just pack your stuff and go. I am done. I don't want you people to kill me before my time. Uh, hey, Minister Sammy and Sister Teju, come back, your own case is different. Daddy. Uh-huh. A very serious matter has been brought to our attention, Minister Sam. As it is, you are under investigation for sexual misdemeanor with young female members. What?! Eh! Our sources are reliable. And, uh, Mommy and I, we have had calls in the past to observe some things. It's only that, uh, the evidence is, uh, not quite enough to go on at the moment. Sam! So, Minister Sam, you are advised to conduct yourself with uttermost discretion for the time being. This matter will be visited again soon, pending the outcome of the investigations. - You may go. Mommy, they can go, right? - Yes. You may go. All I am saying is that there is no smoke without fire. People wouldn't just make stuff up, they must've seen something! - Seen what?! Who told you that there's no smoke without fire, eh? So people don't make stuff up anymore? People have been jealous of you before. Oh, it's because they're jealous. Is that why you stopped sleeping with me? Don't fucking do that, Teju. Don't! You want to investigate me when we should be investigating you! Every day, every Sunday! Tithe, offering, give, give, serve, serve, church seed. You want to investigate me, fuck you! - Sam, please just calm down. - Shut up! You call yourself my wife, but you believe them over me. If it's true, where's the evidence? Hmm? Where are the ladies that are accusing me?! Sam… Sam, I didn't say that I believe them. I just feel that… We need to understand why they came to such conclusions. - That's... That's all I'm saying. You know what? I cannot continue to endure a marriage without trust. Sam… Sam, where are you going? This marriage was a mistake from the beginning. Sam… Sam? Sam, are you home? Sam?! Sam! Sam? Sam! Sam. Sam, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hello, Brother Sam. - Yes, we need to talk. - Talk about what? What are we going to do? The baby is growing. Who is "we"? Listen, Jojo. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. - I've already arranged what you should do. Don't call me again. Hello? Hello? Uh, good day, Ma. - Yes? - I have a delivery for you. - Uh, okay, is that it? - Yeah, that's all. - Okay, thank you. - All right, welcome. Bye. Hello, Sam, I've been trying to reach you, but obviously you've made yourself unreachable. Well, I've decided to do what you wish. After all, what will I do with a baby at this age? What?! What… Hello? Sammy King. Reks?! Reks, you're in this country? You're in town? You're alive?! - Wow! - This is your house? - Yes, of course. You, eh? You've always been a bad bitch! You know, now. You know me, babe. Come on. Hey! This, babe! - Man! - Mm. So, you've been abroad all this while? Ah, guy, the first opportunity I could take… - I left immediately! Guy, it was risky! I had to transport some sensitive stuff, but as God would have it… We've made it! I'm enjoying life now. - -I'm enjoying, I swear. And now? I'm into music. Yes. Guy, I have like two songs on radio, trust me! I'm becoming a star. I'm having a video shoot in two weeks. Will you come? Of course I'll come. - Anything for you. Ah. - God! You look so different. - You look different too, now. Wait, what? It's been like nine years since… Ugh. God! I feel old. No, now, that's not what I mean. So, church? You?! A church boy? Oh, please! You, this criminal! I can't believe you married that cringey church girl. Stop, don't do that. At the end of the day, man, I was at a very bad place, and Teju was there for me. - Mm. - You left me. Please… It's that girl that messed you up. - Ah… - Joy. Eh! Joy! That's the girl that fucked you up. That's her. - -She's a witch. You see that church matter? - Biggest regret of my life, I swear. - Are you joking? But there's money in church! - Eh? - Uh-huh? The kind of money in church business surpasses prostitution, politics, gambling, anything! Church is where the money is. Guy, if I could be a hypocrite, I'd become a pastor myself. I swear. Pastor Reksy, you get me? - But, guy, you can do this thing, now! - You can! Like… Pastor Sammy King. Guy, it'll work, I swear! The kind of money you'll make, don't waste this opportunity! Guy, don't overthink it, just do it! Teju? - Teju, wake up. - Mm… What's wrong? What's the matter? Teju, I just heard from God. What? I just heard from God. He called my name three times. "Samuel. Samuel. Samuel." Are you serious? Told me to get into ministry, just like my father. Oh, Sam. Sam… I've always known that there's a calling on your life. Ever since we were kids. You know, I've run away from this for so long. And… - I've said yes to the Lord, finally. Sam… I can't do this on my own. I need you. Sam, of course. - You're in? - I'll always be here, always. Oh, thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Lord! Amen. - Amen. - Amen! Put this one up there. "Enemies of Satan Ministries." - Ah! - You're not taking this thing seriously. - I am! I'm very serious. I wrote a couple down. Let me… Lay it on me. - "Run For Your Life Ministry." - "Helicopter of Jesus Ministries." - What?! No! That does not work. Okay, okay. "Atomic Bomb Bible Brigade Ministry." Does that even sound right to you? - "Laboratory of Christ". No! Whoa! Teju, I'm tired. "Vineyard of Love Ministries". I like that. "Vineyard of Love Ministries". "Vineyard of Love Ministries". I love that. We got it. Ah… Mm… - Hello, ma'am, welcome. - Good day. - Yes. - Good day, welcome. Ah! Senator Bolaji! - Good morning! How are you? - Good morning! - Please, uh, come in, sir. - I have heard about this church. - Oh, really? - I've been looking forward to coming. - That's why I'm here today. - Oh! Great to have you here. Dear, please. Of course. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you so much. Man of God! Babe! Babe, I can't believe you actually did it. I'm so proud of you, I swear! Look, this level that you've gotten to, we're going to take it higher. - Ooh… - We will cash out! - Reks, you've come again! - What happened? Who are they? See, you just landed the juiciest gig of all time! - Eh? In the name of God PLC! - I didn't get into this thing for money. Don't try me tonight! I'll hurt you! - -Don't try me tonight! Where are you going? Whoever doesn't own a church is in big trouble! You'll cash out, I swear. Ah… Gosh! Money is so sweet! Trust me. - -It's sweet! - Praise the Lord. - Hallelujah! You know, the Bible does say that we shall not despise the days of little beginnings. And so today, I want to take the time to specially appreciate every single one of you for worshipping with us here at the Vineyard Of Love Church. - Put your hands together for yourselves. Now, I want you to tell your neighbor to tell your friend to tell another friend that great things are happening here at the Vineyard of Love Church. - Amen? - Amen! - Hello. - Hi. Hi. Thank you so much for starting this beautiful church. Oh! Glory to God. They're lots of us, you know, from Triumphant Church. Triumphant Church? We came straight here when we heard you started this church. Amazing! God bless you. - Thank you. - Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Hello. A face from Triumphant Way, if I reckon? No. Never been. But I reckon, you know a few young ladies. Oh, pardon? Uh, I mean… I just like your church, it's youth-oriented. It's nice. Thank… God... God bless you. Hello, sir. - Hello, Pastor. - Hope you enjoyed service? - Marvelous. - God bless you, Daddy. Inspector, sir, I just want to understand what you mean when you say "evidence." I mean, she was my sister, and I was aware she was dating Sammy King. And I'm also aware that he was the one that got her pregnant. I mean… I just wish I could have done something more. - I just wished I could have... - Miss Es… Miss Esiri! Calm down, please. But I'm trying now. I'm trying. I'm trying. And I cannot let that murderer get away with my sister's death. As I have said times without number, we cannot just make a case out of Mr. King cheating on his wife or getting your sister pregnant. If you can prove that Mr. King forced your sister to have an abortion against her will, then we have a case. Not with word of mouth, but with evidence. What about phone conversations? Do you have any pictures of them together? Letters? Did your sister keep a journal? Miss Esiri, I would love to help you, but… you need to come to me with one of these. If I can lay my hand on any of them, I promise you, I will reopen the case. Whoa! What? Oh, no, no, no. Nothing. It's... It's fine, it's just… I mean, it's, uh… Tito is in town. Oh, okay. That's nice. Hello? Yeah, I just wanted to find out if there were any mistakes about the money that came into the account. Is that why you called me? See how you're shaking just because of 50 million naira. Yeah, I know, but, Reks, it's… What kind of business are we into? Please relax. Don't worry, you'll never get that chicken change from me again. Yeah. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. No problem. Pastor Tito is in town, he's visiting our parish soon. Oh! That's nice.

So good to see you, Joy. It's good to see you too, Sam. It's a… It's a nice place you have. Oh, please, um, join us. Have a seat. - Sure, sure. - Yes. Who would have thought, right? Sam becoming a pastor and doing so well. You know, that... that church is… That church is impressive. Hello? Hi, Sam, uh, I'm fine. How are you? Uh, how's your wife? Pastor Sam, it's such a pleasure to meet you. - Ah. I'm Bolanle Austen Peters, my daughter attends your church. - Oh! We love parents at our church. - Thank you for all that you do. - Oh, you should come... - Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh. - See you later. - Peace be with you. Joy. I don't know why I'm here, Sam. I… I shouldn't be here. Thanks for agreeing to see me. This is so unreal. You look and seem so different. You… You look the same. Age hasn't done anything to you. You look beautiful. - Sorry. I… - Joy, relax. Mm? We're just two old friends catching up, eh? - Sorry if I seem a bit uptight. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. This is all just a lot. I mean, seeing you in that big church… …pastoring so effortlessly. I mean… Don't be surprised, Joy. You planted the seed in me. You said that I was destined for great things. I did, didn't I? You also said that we were destined to be together. Sam… That was such a long time ago, and everything happened so quickly and I... No! Joy, Joy, don't... don't beat yourself up about it. Yes, when you left, there was… pain, depression. But… that pain made me who I am today. So, thanks to you. So, um… how is Zach? He's still a pastor, right? How's the ministry? Well, uh, after a few years, Zach grew more and more… disenchanted with pastoring at the church. Money was tight, and, um, it just became more and more impractical to rely on tithes and offerings for a living, so… One day, he said he was quitting. Joy, I'm so sorry. I know how much ministry meant to you. But, Joy, Joy, look at me. It's never too late to turn around. Head in the right direction. Sam… Sam, I'm so happy for you. I really am. - Joy? And I'm sorry for how everything turned out, but… I'm committed to Zach. He's my husband and I love him. - Joy, don't go. - I shouldn't have come. - This was a mistake. - Joy! Pastor Sam, this man says he's your brother. Daniel? Oh, Danny… Daniel! All these years… But you didn't look back once. You've made it very clear that you no longer wanted to have anything to do with your family. And we've respected your wishes all these years. The only reason I'm here is because our mother made me promise to. Mama… How is she? She died. Mama is dead? I just want to know. What is your problem? Hmm? What did they do to you that… that was so unforgivable? Huh? All these years, you didn't look back once. You never even came home. Our father has sat at the gate, day after day, waiting for you to come back. Our mother died of a broken heart. But look at you. Samuel! - -Their almighty firstborn son. Hmm? Is this it? - This? This is why? Daniel. What? I'm sorry. Please. I'm sorry I failed you. Forgive me. Please, come. Why? Samuel, why?! Why?! Oh, Daniel. Why? - Listen… I need... I need you to go get Dad. Go get Dad. Whatever… Whatever you need. Do you need money? Are you... Are you listening to yourself? You're even more foolish than I imagined. Now, listen to me very carefully, Samuel. You have very little time to change your ways, your time is coming. See… There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof is destruction. H... How dare you say that to me?! How dare you?! Mm. God, Sam! What's up now? What's up? You're so distant. What's going on? Talk to me, now. I need money. That's why you don't want to give me... No. I need a lot of money. A substantial amount of raw cash. Like, how much are you… How much are you talking? - Enough to leave the country. - Huh? What happened? Do you have any opportunities coming soon? Things are on ground, but it's not small... I want in. I want in. Slow down, now. What happened? See, look… Give me the details. Shit. Tell me. It's not all these small play. It's not powder business again, it's... Reks, I don't care about the details. Just let me know how much I can put in… and how much I stand to gain. But I need this money, like, yesterday. Sam, please stop. Just stop texting me. I'm committed to Zach. Don't text me again. Hey, babe. Hi, darling. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Who was, uh… Who was that on the phone? - Just… …sit down. We need to talk. I… heard the phone call. Zach, I've never cheated on you. - I've never! - I'm not… Let me talk, please. The truth is… none of us are perfect. Especially not me, and… I know I killed your dream when I left the ministry. And somehow I didn't see how unhappy it made you. Obviously, Sam did, and… I guess he sought to take advantage. Babe, I… I need you to understand. Okay, me leaving the ministry, it had... It had nothing to do with letting you down or just… I just couldn't do it anymore. 'Cause it was too much for me. I couldn't… The… The pressure to just be that person that everyone wants you to be. That... That man of God who's the best dressed, has the biggest church, uh, newer technology, bigger buildings. It's just… For me, it was too much. And I couldn't handle it. I felt like I was getting to that point where… …I would be manipulating people for money, and it just... It just didn't sit right with me. I felt like I could serve God just as well from the congregation as… from the pulpit. But that was my decision. I should've… I should've thought about what it would do for you as well. And I'm sorry. And we'll figure it out. - Okay? - Mm. No matter what. Whatever you need… I'm going to pay attention. I love you. I love you too. - Yes? - Pastor Sammy King? May I speak with you for a few moments? Yes… It's regarding your acquaintance with one Miss Rekya Danbo. You're familiar with this name, right? Um… Vaguely. Miss Danbo is dead. Re… Rek… Rek… Rekya? Miss Danbo was involved with a drug and human organ trafficking syndicate. We called because your name appeared on a list we believe to be her client contacts. Me? Um… Officer, I'm a pastor. Um… What will I have to do with drugs and human trafficking? - You know? - That's what we're trying to find out. Pastor Sammy King, when was the last time you were in contact with Miss Danbo? Reks… Dan… Miss Danbo and I were friends from... from school, university. And, um… she only just comes to church, you know, from time to time. All right. Thank you for your time, Pastor, we'll be in touch. Meanwhile, please do not leave town pending the conclusion of our investigation. Yes. No problem. Sam? What's going on? Nothing. Who were you talking to? Uh, wrong number. I overhead the phone conversation. Why were you denying knowing Rekya? The same Rekya whose name is all over all of these disturbing documents. Samuel, I've seen and read all the text messages. I mean… what is this all about? About what? About the papers! Your passport was there. Who's relocating to Canada? The church bank statements… What… Sam, what is happening?! Teju, you're confused. I'm confused? I'm confused? So! So you're really leaving?! You're really leaving?! Without me?! After everything I've done for you?! Huh? Joy?! Rekya?! Josephine?! Yeah! I know about all of them. But I did that for us. I did that for you and me. Because I thought that you were redeemable. Oh, the least you can do is give me answers. Sam! Give me answers! What… Sam! Yes! I'm leaving. I'm leaving you, Teju. I'm leaving you, this church, the house, this country, everything! I'm miserable. I'm miserable! Teju! It's… - I want to be happy! Is that too much to ask? Go be happy… Sam. Because I'm done! But please remember… …I made you. And I… have the power… to destroy you. Hello? Who is this? Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Who are you?! Leave me alone! Leave me! Inspector. I think you're going to need this. I have evidence that my husband is into money laundering and human organ trafficking. From our sermon… …if anyone of you has 100 sheep and loses one, will he not abandon the 99 in the open field and go after the one that is lost? And when he finds him, he... he... he joyfully picks him and puts him on his shoulder and goes home. When he gets home, will he be quiet? He will call his family, his friends and his neighbors to come and celebrate with him. I have found my lost sheep! Glory be to God. He loves us all equally.
