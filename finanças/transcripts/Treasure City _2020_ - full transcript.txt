“As if just then, everything was possible: the ugly approaches the beautiful, ...and vice versa, the ruthless and the weak.” (Thomas Bernhard) - Thank you. - Thanks. What's wrong? My mom was sick and I had to stay with her. What's wrong with her? I don't know. She couldn't get out of bed. But she's better now. You could have called. My battery was dead. Someone kicked the charger under the bed. What about the others? - Left already. - Yeah? Why? - We went over everything. - Did it go well? Uhm, yeah. - Did you pay the bills? - Of course. I paid them last week. Here are the receipts. What's wrong? Nothing, just... Just what? Nothing I just had some... Doesn't matter. - We have to talk. - Sure. - You know why, right? - Yes. I think so. What do you think? - I screwed up with Dina. - Dorottya... What? Dorottya, let's not do this. It makes no sense. It's not that? I already apologized! You being late is just one thing. Dina was really upset. It doesn't matter now. But there's a bunch of other things... This is not about me calling you out on lying or anything. My mom was really sick... Maybe so, but after everything I have real trouble... ...believing you even when you tell the truth. Like? - I don't want to go into specifics. - Okay. So for example, I ask you to write a letter... Then you say you wrote it when you didn't... ...and I start to doubt anything you say is true. I understand. I end up... ...doing twice the work, always checking whether you did what you said you did. I am always wondering: is she telling the truth? - I know, I apologize - No need to apologize... - I'm telling you cause I love you. - I love you too. It's not about that. -I really don't want to... - What? - Doesn't matter. - You don't want what? To disappoint you. How? Whatever. Okay, whatever. Right. You can't disappoint. - No one requires anything of you. - I know. - No one hates you. - I know. Or if you screw up, no one will hate you. - We all make mistakes. - I know. I understand someone lying because they feel guilty... ...for failing to do something. But some of your lies just make no sense to me. Why did you claim to be the interpreter at the Zagreb conference? I didn't. Ivan asked you about the interpreter in Zagreb. Yes. You told Ivan that he was awful... ...and you had to take over and save the day. Yes. But that never happened. You don't even speak English. I speak a bit. I'm not sure. Whenever we are with foreigners... ...you tend to disappear. Now Ivan will never use that interpreter again. And that's a huge fucking problem... ...because your senseless lie has ruined things for someone else. - I understand. - But why? Something overpowers me. What? I keep feeling that some force is compelling me. And I have no power over it. - That's why you lie? - Yes. Right. Maybe this is just another of your fantasies... - It's not. - Then you have to see a shrink. I have... The same thing would just happen again. - What? - I lie to the shrink too... ...and things just get worse. Then you need to find a good psychiatrist. Do you need my help? No... My dad knows some people that I can ask. And will you ask them? Yes. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Will you give me another chance? This is not about giving anyone chances... What are we talking about now? I am really sorry this is happening and I don't understand it. You're like a member of the family. - This isn't about another chance... - This is everything for me. You're the most important to me, really. These application fees had to be paid a long time ago too... - ...otherwise we could lose our funding. - But I paid them. - You said you paid them 2 weeks ago. - Yes! I mailed them myself two weeks ago. Dorottya! Look at the postmark! You paid these today. Few hours earlier... Jim Stark presents A film by Látókép-Production and Art-Játék Association In coproduction with Filmtett In coproduction with Bord Cadre Films and Sovereign Films Cast Costume Designer Set Designer Sound Designer Music Editor Director of Photography Line Producer Co-Producer Co-Producers Co-Producer Produced by Produced by Written and Directed by TREASURE CITY The number of violent attacks committed by migrants are on the rise in Germany. Among the latest victims are doctors, caretakers and even a policeman. By recent surveys a growing number of Germans think... ...that migrants are not fit to be integrated into the German society. Brussels wants to legislate forced migration... ...and to provide debit cards for migrants. This is dangerous. You have the right to know what they are planning in Brussels. This was brought to you by the Hungarian Government. - May I help you? - We're just looking. Pretty, right? Yes. What is this called? Dendrobium. And this one? That's a Guzmania. - And this? - A Money plant. Are you looking for a potted plant? I'm not sure yet. - Is this shade tolerant? - No. - Sun-loving? - Well if it's not shade tolerant... And what is this called? Croton. - It's shade tolerant? - Where would you put it? - I'm not sure yet. - Then I can't tell you. You can't tell me if it's shade tolerant or not? I could, but putting it in the basement or on the roof makes a difference. Sorry, why do you care where I put it? If you just tell me what kind of plant you want... I yet don't know what I want. ...then I wouldn't have to name every plant in the store. Do you have a problem naming the plants in the store? No, we'd just get somewhere. - Oh you're in a hurry? - Not at all. I politely asked about the plants but you... - And I answered politely. - That's polite? - I answered politely. - I asked the plant's name... ...and you said "CROTON!" That's polite? - I just said “croton”. - That's polite? You think it's polite. I think it's nasty. Is this your idea of good customer service? Do you think you live in the Wild West? Okay. Which one do you want? We're going back in time... - Which one do you want? - I haven't decided. Who taught you to serve customers like this? Are you here to buy something or to argue? Am I supposed to feel honored to talk to you? Please don't paw that! That's what you're taught at the flower school? Don't paw? Croton? Don't listen to her Johanna. What is is this manner? Do you even know what your job is? - I know. - Yeah? Do you? Do you know your job is to be nice to customers? Not to sneak up on us to make nasty comments and faces. How do I know you're not here to steal? - Give me the complaint book. - We don't have one. - I want the complaint book. - There isn't one. - What do you mean? - There isn't. - Where can I make a complaint? - You can't. - Call your manager. - I absolutely will not. - Give me his number immediately! - Like I'd give it to every idiot... Idiot? - Let's leave, Johanna. - Stop! You have to pay for that. - Who are you grabbing? A double-trunked Clivia? That'll be 4500 forints. - Let go of my arm! - Pay for it first. - I won't. You broke it. - Pay or I call the police. Pay for it yourself. That will teach you about service you dirty little cunt. - You hit me in front of the child? - You ruined that plant! - She broke the plant! - I didn't! You did it, you little shit. There are no witnesses, right Johanna? Let's get the fuck out of here. - You're not going anywhere, migrant bitch. - Migrant-hating asshole! Stupid gypsy whore Pay for what you broke. Yeah-yeah? Migrant-hater! I'll wreck your store you fascist turd! Alright, you gypsy bitch! - Gypsy hating big mouth... - She came in and broke this. - A five-trunked clivia. - Shoot into my hole too! Then she tried to leave. Your slut of a mother wanted to leave! I've got the fucking evidence. I'm calling the police. Blabber on you Nazi fuck. Oh my God. How can I be like this? Oh, God. Why do people like me even exist? Who am I? I love you so much. I love you too. Forgive me! Forgive me... Please excuse me. I'll pay for it. - No need. - Please forgive me, I'll pay. I said no need. Let me buy a plant then. What is this called? Stargazer lily. - Great, thanks. How much? - 11990 Forints. Excuse me, how much? - Márk! - Lay off him. Márk! Lord Jesus, please bless these gifts bestowed on us by you. Amen. Amen. Enjoy. - What’s wrong?... - I told you not to put parsley in it. - You know I’m allergic to it. - Without a little, it has no taste. - Listen, Márk… - Leave this to us. You want me to start throwing things on the floor too? - You lied. - Please don't talk to me like that... ...because I don't talk like that to you either. Now clean it up! - You tried to poison me. - That's enough... Your mother means well and you provoke her. - Stay out of this. - She means well... - Don't talk back!...And clean it up! - I only talk the way you talk to me. Do you even know what you're doing? You spit out the soup and throw food on the floor? - Unbelievable... Stay out of this. - What kind of attitude is this? Who do you think should clean it up for you? Pick it up, bring the mop, clean up and apologize. If you slam the door again, I will smack you across the room. - Do you see what you’re doing? - What is he doing? - That’s his business. His and mine. - Not only yours. I'm also at the table. I live here too. Why do you have to threaten and humiliate him like that? What humiliation? You yell just like me. - You can but I can’t? - If you were smarter just once... - You won't let us build a relationship. - What relationship? - Any kind of relationship. - You always put him down. - You won't let him defend himself. - I won’t let you hurt him. Who's hurting him? Let him defend himself... Let him hate me or love me, fight and make up with me... But you won’t let him. I can only love him the way you want me to. You won’t let anything real to develop. You insert yourself before anything real can happen. What am I to him? A shadow... ...always kept away from by his mother. - You isolate yourself. - I'm afraid to do anything else. You've never even bothered to do anything for him. This “never-nothing” is so untrue. - When did you ever him a story? - I read to him. I did. I always wrestled with him... rode bikes with him. IF you were in the mood, but never when he was. This “never” is completely false and incredibly unfair. It's exactly you who locks him into a shell. You won't let him make connections, not in school, not anywhere. You stand in front of him, shielding him. You always have to insert yourself. He'll need your protection and be calling you... ...even when he’s 50. At least he'll have someone to talk to. And it definitely won't be you, because he doesn't trust you. Sure... Because you convinced him that I can't be trusted. You project your imagination onto me. You discredit me... ...make me a laughing stock. That's your perverse joy. You know what you have achieved with all this? You’re not hurting me, you're hurting him. He's got no male role model. Because the man is destroyed right in front of him. The man he sees is ridiculed, put down, worthless... ...that is what a man is. He will only understand who I am when I am gone. If even. We can't continue like this... with this kind of parenting. So we have to punish him? He has to learn that he can't act like this. - And he can't go out today. - You can't decide that. - Then who decides? You? - We decided and promised this. - He broke the rules. - Your arbitrary rules? Unbelievable. - He spit and threw food on the floor! - He didn’t throw it just… He almost broke the door. We just have to just accept this? - He’s a teenager... with raging hormones. - We have to accept that? His body, his soul is in transition. Is this so hard to grasp? Before that it was his teacher's fault or his classmates'. - There's always something. - Because he’s human... with emotions. And luckily he can express them. But you attack him so he has to suppress these emotions. - I’ve only been returning for years. - He should swallow, feel ashamed... - I just return your serves. - ...be a good servant. I'm tired of this garbage you picked up on the internet. - Just leave him alone, please. - I want to talk to him. Just don't. He doesn't need more humiliation. - How do you know I will do that? - Because you always do. - Hey, what are you doing? - Let go of me! There's no need for this... Done! We're all done. - Let's give them our papers! - Here's our IDs. There. We're done. Okay, we've finished. We came here today... ...because the one party-state is dismantling our legal institutions. RIGHT! THAT'S RIGHT! This country has earned its liberty by sweat and blood. Those in power are selling off our rights. We stand before the National Court of Audit... ...responsible for the purity and transparency of our public life. Under the current regime, this rotten institution... - ...has never fulfilled its duties. - THAT'S RIGHT! - It is a corrupt, lying fraud. - THAT'S RIGHT! HURRAH! - You are all communists! - You're all filthy, rotten communists! - Shut up already! Your mothers should have killed you in the womb. Go home and watch TV! You're completely crazy. What else do you need? [ACTIVIST]: We won't let saggy-balled, corrupt mercenaries destroy our lives. WE WON'T LET IT GO! WE WON'T LET IT GO! People are fed up with you Mr. Prime Minister. While you're making production reports, people are leaving the country! Hundreds of people left the country in the past years. The car's here, but they've vanished. - They must have gone to the woods. - I hope they won't get lost. I'd rather this day isn't about chasing after them - What's wrong? - Nothing, just my head's about to split. - You don't want to take some meds? - I've checked but we're out. - We had a pill left. - I took it this morning. Well, then... I don't know. Should I massage your hand? Yeah. WE WON'T LET IT GO! WE WON'T LET IT GO! While you claim to protect the country from terrorists... ...seven people commit suicide every single day. Two thousand people commit suicide each year in this miserable country. We are number one in the world, Mr. Prime Minister! You should think about this! People shouldn't fear of strangers, but they should fear of themselves! You keep fighting going to war with everyone. You incite hatred. Since day one you try to turn people against each other. We want to cooperate! - Have I been asleep long? - A few minutes. I had a terrible dream. - Yeah? What? - I can't remember, something stupid. But I woke up with a horrible feeling. It was clear to me that this is over. This what? Us. You don't love me anymore? I love you but this is not true love any more. Everything that happened, happened. From now on it's all reruns. Done. And if you fell in love with someone? That'd also just be a rerun. Won't you close the door? Where have you been? - We were down by the river. - The woods here are really beautiful. Another round? Why are you looking at me? Drink, if you want to. - Happy birthday. Cheers! - Thank you. It's good, you can clearly taste the quince. -Shall we dance? - Now? - I would. Will you put some music on? - Sure. - When was the last time you danced? - Can't remember. You? You just danced on New Year's, then on your birthday... ...you dance all the time. - Good evening. - Good evening. - What may I bring you? - What would you like? - Ginger ale. - Sadly, we're out. The gentleman at that table is drinking the last one. Then orange juice, please. I can't recommend it. - It's not good? - No. Plus it's old. I'd be happy to make you a lemonade from real lemons. - Is that okay? - Yes. For the lady? I'm not sure, some... I'm not sure what I feel like. Not sure, maybe some... Cherry pie? Cherry pie, yes! Is it fresh? Fresh. Plus our coffee machine is also very good. - I'll take an espresso and a pie. - Splendid. - I'll be right back. - Thank you. - It's incredible how he guessed it. -What? I almost said cherry pie... ...but then he said it. Don't look. - You know him? - No. Is he looking at you or me? I don't know. Oh, it fell? Very kind, thank you. Thank you. Are you cold? Should I turn off the AC? Yes, please. Very kind of you. Every waiter should act like this. This should be a standard. Where could have I seen you before? - I don't know. - Have you worked here long? - Two years. - Did I not come for that long? - Student work? - No... I am a waiter. - Do you like the lemonade? - Yes. - And the pie? - Very good, yes. It matches the dress. Oh, right. I hadn't noticed. Very pretty. The dress may be but the contents... - Forget it... Just forget it. - Very pretty. It's a mere... She'll be much prettier. She's also very pretty. May I? Sure. - How old are you? - Eleven. You're not eleven yet... you will be in October. I'm in my eleventh year. This place hasn't changed a bit... in 20 years. At least some things are permanent. A little change doesn't hurt now and then. - Do you wish for a change? - No, of course not... Why would I? Still, it's so empty. - Is it always this empty? - At this time of the day... But at least I can talk to the guests. Yes. But you wouldn't want to spend your life here, right? Why not? Well, I don't know... - What did you want to become as a child? - A waiter. A waiter? But why? My father was a waiter too. Just like my grandfather. - They also worked here. - I see. The parents and grandparents of today's guests used to come here. - I used to come here too. - You said that already. Then you came to my father. Yes... perhaps. - Do you know him? - No. It's his first time here. He has been staring since we entered. Is he bothering you? Could you ask why he is staring? My daughter is scared. Certainly. - Why did you say I was scared? - Well, just because... You always blame things on me. He says you were his teacher in high school. He said that? - Is it true? - It's true I am a teacher... ...but I don't recall him. He says he he confessed his love to you one time. That's a mistake... ...and a shameless one. No one ever confessed their love to me. Ridiculous. - No one has ever confessed their love? - Never. Not that I remember. Or so long ago I can't remember. Could it be true? Why would have anyone confessed? Because you are very attractive. I only used to be... once. You still are. - And kind. - I'm not kind. She's kind. You are. Very kind. Did you like the pie? Yes. - And the lemonade? - Yes. May I bring something else? Did he pay? Of course. - Anything else? - Sadly we have to leave... - ...my daughter is tired. - I'm not tired. - May I ask for the guestbook? - Certainly. - Could you wrap this up for me? - Certainly. Would you give me your name? Dénes. "Dear Dénes..." - What's up, darling? - Dorottya never came. - What do you mean? - She didn't. - Did you try calling? - Her phone is off... - ...and she doesn't answer my texts. - Listen I can't talk now. - I should have left ten minutes ago. - What can I do from here? - Can't I just go alone? - Definitely not. How? There's a train in 20 minutes. It's safe. Don't be ridiculous. I've been on a train alone before. Yes, only not at night. I can take care of myself. You talk to me like I'm a child. - Because that's what you are. - I'm not a child. - Listen, Dina, how would you get home? - I'll take a cab. - For a small fortune... give me a break! - I'll use my pocket money. Should I recite a poem? Sir, don't touch me, please! I'll be on my way home! Don't touch me! I will do as I please, this is a free country. - Do you admit to committing vandalism? I won't admit to it. Vandalism is the deliberate destruction of public or private property. We acted for the public's good. - Do you admit to committing misdemeanor? - To that I admit to, yes. - Dina, I said, no. - You won't even listen to me. I know what you want to say, and no! Right, I need to hang up, bye. - Can we leave then? - No. We gave you the papers, confessed to the misdemeanor. Why can't we leave? Tell me the reason for not letting us go! - Alright. I have a family, I need to go. - So why don't you take care of them? - Why are you making a scene here? - What? Why are we "making a scene?" That's exactly why we're "making a scene", because of this mentality! Let me be! Let go of me! LET HER GO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I just want you to know… Every blessed day, as long as I remember, you've caused a scandal somehow. Your mother and I got along very well before you were born. We never fought. But now we fight every day, solely because of your behaviour It hurts me deeply. And it hurts her too. It hurts everyone. So if you want us to stop fighting... ...for us to be a normal family, then please behave like a normal person. No one will put up with this for you. No community likes a person who creates nothing but conflicts. Such people end up outcast. I'm only saying this so you can prepare yourself... ...that you'll be facing this everywhere if you don't change your ways. That's for sure. Now go and clean that dirt up until you can eat off that floor. Then we can go. - Peace be with you, reverend. - Peace be with you. Fasten your seatbelt. What road should we take? Through the main square, by the zoo? Yeah, yeah. - Behind the Palace of Culture, right? - Yeah. Evening workout? No. Athlete? No... I was on a filmshoot. Uh-huh. What did you do there? I was an extra. Uh-huh... What kind of a movie? I don't know. - What did you have to do? - Nothing. - Are they paying well? - No. - Y-you could have turned here. - Really? - I thought it's a one-way. - No, it's a two-way. Anyway, we'll go around. - But it's a long way... - I know. Cigarette? Oh, sorry, you're an athlete... I'm not an athlete. - Would you like one, then? - Yes, please. Thanks. It's not very healthy. No. It's either do sports, or destroy yourself. Both together are dangerous. Well, yeah. Going home? Yes. - A girlfriend waiting, a wife? - No. No wife? Not any more. Divorce? Yes. Got a kid? I do. - Boy, girl? - Girl. - How old is she? - She just started the school. And you? How old are you? Twenty-three. - Then she came early. - Well, yeah. And the parents? What did they said? What could have they... Her father wanted me dead. Her brother threatened me to marry her. - So that's why you married her? - No, not just because of this. Did you ever want other women? No. There are a lot of pretty women in this city. Yeah, a lot. It's a good mix around here. Pretty faces, pretty eyes, right? - Proportionate bodies. - Yes. Been to any whores? I heard the prices are good. All the way for 5000. Uh-huh. I can take you to a good place... introduce you to someone. I don't know. You have to try it once. No,no... not today. - Hallo, darling. - Hi! - Has Dorottya checked in? - No. - She texted me back. - Yeah, and what? Her mom is sick. She has to stay home with her. I asked her to go there, but her cell is off again. - It's too late now anyway. - I'll tell her off when I see her. Please don't! - It's not the first time she's done this. - Don't tell her off. Okay, I won't. - I'm so sorry about this. - Whatever. - What are you up to? - Sitting. - Where? - On a chair. - What are these noises? - What noises? - Some loudspeaker... - Maybe the TV. What are you up to? - I’ll tell you later. - When are you coming home? Not sure, I still have a meeting about tomorrow's schedule. - Did you eat? - Yes. Okay, don’t stay up too late. There’s school tomorrow. - Kisses, good night! - Good night! - He didn't like it. - How do you know? - He kept fuckin' sighing. - Let him sigh. Not in front of the audience! Who was that chick with him? I saw her at the protest the other day, wandering on the stage. She's eager to learn, to volunteer… Alma. So little emotion doesn't work... Intimate and quiet isn't the same as emotionless. It's there only it's withheld. You understand? You need to mobilise a lot more from within. You need to dig deep inside. The pool is there in front of you but instead of jumping in... ...you go around and think that you swam across. But everyone wants you to jump. The ending depends on you. If you just go through the motions... ...of going from A to B, why bother? Ervin. - Ervin! - Yes? In the third scene, you stopped acting naturally. These false notes keep coming back. I can't even imitate it. - You're not in a music hall! - I thought because of the AC... Oh stop screwing around... You're too conscious of the audience. Anything to get a laugh. Where are you? I can't reach you. Where are you? I can't reach you. Sorry, my mum got sick, I had to stay home. - You were watching the audience again. - I wasn't. You were. I don't know what to do about this. - Gimme a fucking break, I wasn't. - I was right across from you... - ...I saw you eyeballing the bald guy. - You're shitting me! - You think I'm making this up? - I was staring at Alma the whole time. No. You kept peaking sideways like a hen. Totally amateur. - I wasn't fucking peeking. - Do you think when she's talking... ...they aren't watching you, waiting for your reactions. That's like saying someone else's lines, like in some carnival show. I wasn't watching! I wasn't! Goddamn, give me a break!... - ...You keep fucking with me! - Just shut up! I don’t care, he keeps giving me shit. That you're focused on the audience means you're not engaged. I'm a thousand percent engaged. Like this! All we see is your fear of forgetting your lines. Where? I fuckin' recited everything neat and sharp. - At best you conveyed the plot. - What plot?! Words come out of you all jumbled up. - Where? - Throughout. You have never said it all correctly. You're screwing with these three. That's fuckin rough... ...I don’t even remember this. You forgot to make your entrance. I just thought I had more time because I had to take a shit. Anyway, your lack of concentration is chronic. You need to sleep it off... ...then repeat the lines a hundred times. Or more. You know how fuckin’ hard this is for me? - It’s the same back home. - What? What’s in this bloody fuckin' play. - It’s eating me up for fuck's sake. - You just don't know your lines... I thought I did. We rehearsed a lot. Then you have to see a shrink or a neurologist... ...because you might have a neurological problem. - Maybe even dyspraxia? - Gimme a fucking break... You've known me forever for fuck’s sake. Tomorrow we start an hour early. I want to look at some scenes. - And you yawn during rehearsals. - When? Gimme a break already. Fuckin' hell. - What’s up? - He comes in, totally unprepared... You have to force his lines out of him. He fucks it up, then denies it. - That's it, he’s like that. - He is. Idiot. Must be neurological. I've never seen anyone screw up so many times. - He puts his heart in it. - But why does he deny his mistakes? - He's defending himself. - He should just apologize. So how did you like it? I got goosebumps, really... ...in the first twenty minutes I completely forgot that... ...the audience is around me. Then I looked around to realize... ...that I’m in still in the theatre. Really, thank you so much. It’s interesting what you say. Extremely, extremely subtle and... ...so delicate. Very touching. Can't remember the last time I felt this way. Thanks. - I'm glad. Can you give me a lift? - Yeah, sure. - Where are you going? - Uhm... downtown. - Want a ride? - If there is room. Thanks. - Sure. We’re only two. - Thanks! - Which one is your coat? - This green one. - Here. - Thanks. Watching some of these scenes... ...my childhood, my parents totally came back. - You live with your parents? - No! Um... My dad left and my mum has died, so I live with my grandma. What is this? Put it on, please. Is the train delayed? Yeah... A train hit a herd of boar and we have to wait until they clean it up. Is this a tawny owl? No. It's a little owl. Her wing is broken. - Are those her feathers? - No, a parrot’s. I put them in the same cage, so they would make friends. But she ate it. I thought she was ill... She seemed so helpless. A bird of prey... That's her nature. What are you reading? Astrology. - Is that your job? - No, this is just... And what are those books? Tarot, palmistry, so on... - You can read palms? - Uh-huh. May I read yours? - I don’t know. - May I? Come, give me your hand. Very interesting. Something bad? Not bad... well, I’m not sure. This little curve here... ...means a great change coming to your life in two years. - What change? - You’ll get to know an older boy. - What kind of boy? - An athlete. Handball. Football, maybe. And this turnout means... ...you'll have a little girl. You get married and live together six years. Outcast, in poverty. Friends and family turn away from you. Your husband’s kind but dull. You’re destined for more. After six years you separate... You get a degree and remarry. Later you remarry twice more and bear nine children in all. You travel, get several degrees, and you always land on your feet. People will love you because you are so righteous... ...and fill their lives with meaning. From your nine children... ...you'll have 41 grandchildren, and 53 great-grandchildren. Old age will bring you to Brazil, to a house full of animals. Parrots,jaguars, poison frogs and blue pigeons wander around your kitchen. Then one day... ...a white sailboat shows up at your house, but with no one on board. The ship floats there for weeks.... Until I get on board and sail down the Amazon. Yeah, you sail down the Amazon. How did you know? I read it on the internet. Everyone has been sharing that story on Facebook. Really? I won’t have a husband, just a child. The girl’s about right. Let’s arm wrestle? Okay. - Hey, Johanna. - Hey. - Mommy? - In the kitchen. - Hi. - Hi. - How was it? Good. - Where's this plant from? - Bought it. Why? - For our anniversary. - What anniversary? It’s 20 years today that we met. Fuck. I forgot. How can I be such a dick! I mixed up the months. Don’t worry. - I’m sorry. I didn't buy anything. - Don’t worry. - Should I pick up some bubbly? - Bought that too. Where is it? Groups of drug trafficking migrant youth terrorize... ...the locals, in the center of Brest, France. The police has advised the public that... ... these gangs are organized and extremely violent. It is reported that public toilets had to be closed, to put an end to the ever growing brutality. The frenzied migrants dragged pedestrians into the toilets, to assault and to rob them. French authorities detained a male migrant... ...who killed his Holocaust-survivor neighbour. The murderer stabbed his elderly victim 11 times, then set her on fire. The victim is presumed to have been alive when the arson happened. According to the victim's family, she has loved the assailant like a son. And now to Sweden... This footage shows migrants vandalising downtown Malmö. This has become a daily sight in the Scandinavian city. - Should we take you all the way? -Don't bother. - When will you be done? - Don't know yet. Should we wait? Where are you going? - He didn't ask us to wait. - He didn't say we shouldn't wait. He shrugged. He didn't care. Yeah, he didn’t want to say it, but wanted us to wait. How do you know his thoughts? Why do you have to be the one to say what he likes? - He'll call if he needs us. - Is it so hard to wait? Are we really supposed to park by the side of road and just wait... - Yeah, that would be the right thing to do - All right then. Don’t roll it down please, I'm freezing. The heating's on. -And I’m suffocating. - You play with the ventilation... ...open all the windows. You scratch around like a hen. Seriously, this comfort-hysteria… This is the limit of my territory. -I’m so fed up with this. -Me too. I'm sick of it. Me too. Hi. Sorry. No problem. -Some things came up. -No problem, I was late too. Good evening, sir. What may I bring you? Nothing. Music, perhaps? No, no thank you. What’s this? Pond turtle. I found it when I was a kid on the highway. A truck ran over it. Thanks. Souvenir. Yes, I know. What’s this? Cigar-cutter. Thanks. Used to be my granddad’s. He's dead? Not yet. Thank you. I need to go soon. Me too. Then let's agree on how we can separate on friendly terms. - Oh, here comes this fateful tone… -Ok, mock me. I'm not, but try to think about what this would mean in practice. We separate. And then? Where should I go? - I’ve nowhere to go. - Then we'll move. To where? From what money? - I’ll take care of that. - Take care how? Then we'll just starve. - Just to increase my guilt. - You don’t have to feel guilty. But I will. You can’t decide that. Are you really so selfish you'd expose your child to that? I’m that selfish. Have you thought of how this might hurt him? What about the congregation? Did you think of that? I don't care. Do you ever consider that we are the role models to them? You just want to preserve the perfect facade. I don’t give a shit. You don't care about hurting them? About undermining their faith. That everything falls apart just because you’re fed up? What a selfish act. Because I'm a damned selfish pest. That's what you say... ...but you act like I said it. You just said that I’m a selfish nobody. No. I said it would be a“selfish act.” Which makes me a miserable, selfish pest. I never said “miserable” nor “pest”. I don’t use those words. - You say miserable all the time... - Not in ages. - You say it every day. - Now comes the humiliation... - ...it's me, this mean, dirty… -You’re incredibly vulgar lately. I'm vulgar, if I want to be vulgar! Don’t tell me how to speak! You're the one aggravating things by using all these words. I’m the aggressive bitch… Stop it already! I've never said that. - Here come the threats. - I’m not threatening, but you provoke... Mockery, humiliation, threats, one follows the other... - It's not me you have to answer to. - I don't answer to anyone. - You have to answer to God. - You never believed in Him. - How does one end up here? - You never believed in anything. What’s going on with you? - What's in your head? - You can't admit it. - What? - That you don't believe. I’m searching! I’ve been searching for my relationship with Him my whole life. You’re searching for a relationship... ...in short, you have been lying your whole life. Just remember, I'm not the one who started this. You started all of this, you understand? I'm just countering your attacks. Twenty years? That's rugh. I always thought this would be temporary. - What? - Like it wouldn't last. What? Everything that happened so far would be temporary. As if I've been waiting for things to fall into place. - But nothing ever did. - You're never satisfied. - What didn't fall into place? - Nothing. You have your life... ...and a beautiful child. Both of you are healthy. What's missing? - Who do you expect to fix it for you? - I expect no one. - Starting tomorrow I'll be a shopclerk. - What? - What’s this nonsense again? - Everything I do is nonsense for you. - It's what it is. - What will a new job fix? I don't want this life any more. I was never free. You always did whatever you felt like. No one forced you to do anything. I was never really free. - That was all on you. - Yes, on me. You've always had more freedom than me. I never let myself be free. Once, when I was still teaching at the other school... ...there was a boy who confessed his love to me. And? He was 16. I was 28. Yes? Poor thing had no mother or father. He wasn't a gypsy but lived in a slum... ...in a shack he built himself. Yeah. And? He never missed a day of school. Not sure why, but I took pity on him... ...so one day in the hallway I let him kiss me. Yeah? He got confused... I kind of fell in love with him... He used to stand outside under our window. Kind of how? I felt his intensity but I ignored it. - You had sex with him. - No! Yes. - You never told me... fuck. - You were aggressive back then. You fucked him and you say you were never free. - I knew you'd react like this - How should I?... - ...You’re my wife. - What gives you exclusive rights to me? You remember the last time we made love? A long fucking time ago. But not because of me, that's sure... Perhaps because of me. Definitely, since you sleep on the couch. Because I can't sleep with the TV on. And I can only sleep with the TV on. So that's the problem. Perhaps. Perhaps just that. How many times did you have sex with him? Once. Where? Right here, on this couch. For fuck's sake... You're such a slut. Where’s mum? She left. Where to? That way. Forgive me. I said really stupid things to you. I apologize. - You said that already. - Yes, I know. Forgive me as well... - ...both of you. - Of course we're not mad at you. I’m proud of you. Proud? Why? Because you’ve got character. You’re brave and honest. Our family is full of cowardly and dishonest people. When you have a problem, never bury it inside. Shall we look for her? She will come back. So... how much time is involved? - Two or three times a week. - That works for me. How much acting experience do you have? I played a small part in a play... nothing I want to talk about. Why? - It was an awful experience. - Yeah? Why? Not sure. - It didn't go well? - Yeah, but I... - I had to undress and... - You felt ashamed? Not even that... but it was totally gratuitous. I see. You had toget completely naked? Yes. For how long? Yeah, pretty long... - Like 20 minutes. - Hm, so... You just stood there or...? I had a love scene with a guy. He told me he hated it too... I see. I don’t want to play this down, but it’s a complex issue... ... because theatre is about people. Souls and bodies. These things need to be shown. Yes, I know. - Sometimes illustrations are not enough. - I know, but... ...perhaps on this level it wasn’t worth it. I felt nothing but fear and shame. How old were you? Sixteen. I wasn't comfortable with my body at all and... ...it was all so miserable. This stuff is very human. - First, you have to accept yourself. - Yeah. Once you do that, there's nothing to be afraid of... ...because then you answer to no one. You don't have to live up to anyone else's expectations. If you accept yourself, there’s nothing to be afraid of. You enter the theatre, what do you see? Actors seem to accept themselves... ...but it's all just an act. This is why I hate the theatre. Behind it all, there’s nothing but fear. The actor goes on stage in terror. And acts like he isn't afraid. But look closely: they're shitting their pants. Why? They fear the audience, the critics... They fear each other. All they care about is who liked what, who said what... ...there's nothing behind it but fear. They fear the humiliation... ...of being humiliated. People love humiliating each other. It starts in elementary school, continues at the university, and blooms on the stage. Totally... Wherever I went, it was like that. So horrible. Has this affected your sex life? - I mean… -No, fortunately not. So you can relax, no hang-ups? No, not at all... ...luckily everything works fine. - No problems with that then. - None. Have you tried a threesome? What? No. Not that. Haven’t even thought of it? Maybe... I'm not sure. When? During masturbation? I guess… Did it arouse you? I think yes, maybe... Nothing to be ashamed of. No one will condemn you for that. These are not some dark desires. Do you want to try it? I don’t think so. Don’t be ashamed. This is completely natural. This is the most fundamental human right. We do threesomes too. Everyone does. Every girl has tried it. Kiss it. I can’t do this now. Come on, I'll help you. No. I’m sorry... I’m sorry, sir. Don’t be childish. Forgive me. All right, get out. I’m really sorry... I'm so lame. Just get out. You hung up. What's up? What's going on? Answer please! Okay, you messed up. I'll be at the café. Are you still there? ...after she defaced the offices of the Commission of Election Integrity. Then she was sentenced to a one year probation. Later she threw paint at the President's office. She was sentenced for 300 hours of community service. The activist went live on the biggest social platform... ...then their group sprayed orange paint on the building of the National Court of Audit While being questioned by the police, she escaped custody... ...reseized a paint can and continued defacing the building. This is a dangerous time to stand by the road. - I almost hit you. - You didn’t hit me. No, 'cause I spotted you at the last second. Cars speed up around that blind curve. Very dangerous. I know. Why are out alone at night? I went for a walk. - Alone? - Yes. - Where are you parents? - At home. Shouldn't you go home? - They may be looking for you. - They aren't. - How do you know? - I know. - What’s your name? - Johanna. And yours? Henrik. - It’s your real name? - It is. Strange name… but it suits you. Thank you. And what are you? What do you mean? What’s your occupation? You know, our family is very old. Artisans, millers, instrument makers... They came here 300 years ago. Honest, hard working people. They were esteemed but they never mixed with anyone, and... - But what's your occupation? - I'm about to tell you... Okay, don't tell me then. And what do you want to be, when you grow up? - A wizard. - Wizard? You mean a magician? No. A wizard. The wizards on the TV are just magicians, you know. And their magic is just made up of well rehearsed tricks. I know, but I want to be a real wizard. - Like Harry Potter? - He is a fictional character. Yes, that’s true. - Wizard then. - Yes. How do you plan to learn wizardry? I already have. - What kind of sorcery do you do? - All kinds. Such as? Like... I can control electricity. What's this? What's happening? Did you touch something? For God's sake, I can't see anything. I'm driving now. Don’t do this again, okay? You scared me to death. I picked you up and you do this to me? You stopped because I made you stop. You wanted to pass me by. - That's not true. - It is. You didn’t even think of stopping. - Would you take your shades off? - No. - Why? - Because. - Please! - I said, no. You have babyish eyes. - I’m just tired. - Why? - Because I can’t sleep. - Why? - Don't know. - Guilty conscience? I don’t know. Maybe. Why? I don’t know. - You should take a nap. - I told you, I can't. But you can. Subtitles created by Bálint Erkel
