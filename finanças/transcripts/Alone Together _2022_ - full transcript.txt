Bill de Blasio, New York city's mayor, is closing all New York City public schools, affecting more than one million students starting tomorrow. During this public health crisis, major retailers are also going dark. Bars and restaurants could be next in New York City. Every option is on the table. It's so weird. No, there aren't many people out at all. Have you been watching the news? Yeah. I'm gonna get outta town. How are you? New York City transit discourages the use of subway trains, except for essential workers. All trains will stop in 24 hours. Attention. The 5 Train from Grand Central Station is delayed. It will arrive in 25 minutes. Yeah, so my train was delayed. No, I mean, it shouldn't be that big of a deal. It's just kind of a pain in the butt, but, you know. - What? - Spare any change? No, sorry. - What'd you say? - Can you spare any change? - I don't know. - I got the COVID. I have to call you back. Oh, sorry. The world's ending, bitch. Shouldn't have to ask you twice. Selfish! Hi. I'm trying to get to Hudson. I missed the-50 and the seven o'clock is sold out. I need a ticket on the-42. Yeah, canceled. What? What, are you hard of hearing? No. Fuck. Okay. I'm trying to get to my Airbnb, all right? And it's not my fault that my train was delayed. Yeah well it's not my fault that I'm about to be out of work. So? Look, I'm sorry. It's just been a really long day, okay? Yeah, well maybe call a Lyft. You think they go that far? Yeah. Thanks. Good luck, sweetie. You look tired. Yeah, I guess I am. You like the country? Oh, uh, no. I like the city, but you know, with everything that's going on... I have some hand sanitizer if you want. You do? Where did you find it because every place I went to, they were sold out. My wife found it for me. Good woman. Take it. I've got extra. That's really nice. Thank you. It's nothin'. Are you married? Uh, no. I mean, not yet. But I do want a husband and kids someday. Mm. Someday, huh? Yeah, someday. Why is that funny? Oh, I'm not laughing at you. It's just that people think they have all the time in the world, keep putting things off. I met my wife, married her right away. We have four kids. That's nice. Yeah, it's not always easy, but the good stuff never is. Oh my God, is that a deer? Yep. I haven't seen a deer since I was a kid. Nice house. Yeah. You need help with the bag? No, I got it. - Thank you. - Okay, good luck. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No. No, no, no, no. No. Shit. Shit.

This is 34 Cherry Lane, right? 34, yeah. Yeah, it is. My boyfriend booked this place on Airbnb for a week. I hate to break it to you, but I reserved this Airbnb. What? Yeah, my friend Jimmy hooked me up. I booked the Airbnb. I booked it yesterday. Oh, well... We booked it on Sunday. Well, I don't what to tell you. I signed for this yesterday. I got an email confirmation, if you want to check it out. You have a car. I do. Obviously there's been this huge misunderstanding and you know, I'm sure your friend Jimmy is very nice. Oh, you're sure about that? No, I'm not. I don't know him, I don't know you, but you seem nice, so I'm sure you have very nice friends. Okay? And you seem very logical. Logical? - Yeah. - Right. You know, I mean, well and since you have a car and you know, obviously owner, Tim, double booked us and I don't have a car, otherwise I would drive to a hotel tonight, so. So? So I think you need to drive to a hotel tonight and we can resolve this whole thing tomorrow. Oh, you're saying I should leave? Well, I booked it on Sunday, you booked it yesterday. I had it first. Do you even have an email confirmation. I mean you didn't even book it yourself. Well, it was booked. I'm fucking exhausted, okay? It's been a really long day and I, I really need to charge my phone. I need to get in the bath and just get a good night's sleep. Did you come from the city? Yes. Why? Yeah. Upper West Side? -Yes. What? Nothing. How did you know where I was from? Yeah, well lucky guess, I think. Where are you from? Wisconsin? From Wisconsin? No, why? Well you drink beer. Oh, only people from Wisconsin drink beer? No, that's, that's not what I meant. Do you want a beer? No. No. I want some sleep. All right. All right. What are you doing? You know what, it's late, you came a long way. Hey, don't worry. I'll take the couch. Where's the bedroom? Yeah, I think second on the left, upstairs. Yeah, I think there's only one bathroom. Oh, gross. Gross, ew. I hope I don't get it, god. Please don't give it to me from this gross, disgusting person. My husband and I are going through a divorce and he must have also booked it. There's nothing I can do. Well, maybe a refund. You know what? Gotta call you back. My mother's on the other line. Yeah, sure. No. No. I know I packed that wine opener. God. Where is that wine opener? I know I put it- Hey, do you always talk to yourself? Oh, um, sorry. What are you doing up here? I gotta pee. Oh. Yeah, don't worry. I'll be, I'll be two seconds. Oh, there you are. -Shit! Fuck! Shit. Oh, man. Do you need some help or something? Oh, yeah. I just spilled a little... Oh, you know, I'm downstairs, so. All right, good night. Night. New York just told all non-essential workers in the state to simply stay home. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, is joining us right now. Governor, do you have, right now, all the protective equipment that you need to fight this highly contagious and deadly virus? No, I don't have enough gloves. -I don't have enough PPE. We don't have enough ventilators. The ventilators are the long pole in the tent here. This is unique. We don't have... Hey. You okay? Hang on for a second. So we're in a scramble. Yeah, no, I'm good. How you doin'? I have called you like five times. Yeah, well more like 10 times, but okay. So why didn't you call me back? I've been, uh, I've been busy. I know that, but I worry and you can't do that to me. I'm your mother. I'm sorry, mom. I am, I'm sorry. You know, I was, I wasn't thinkin'. So are you okay? Mm, I'm good. I'm fine. I'm okay. You're not at work, are you? You know, there's a curfew right now. No, work's closed, so. Well even your place? Yeah, even my place. What are you gonna do? Do you have savings? Your rent is ridiculous. I got a bunch of savings. I got a load of all that stuff. You know, I do well. You know that. I know, I know. I'm just little over worried these days. After all, it's my job. Yeah, I do. You know what? Well, let's not get worried. Let's not get worried until there's something to worry about. You're right. You are so totally right and I am delighted to hear from you. So, you with Evelyn? No, no, I'm not. Ooh, did something happen? I don't know. She said she wanted other things and all that shit, so that's it, you know, we're not together. But I thought you two were so happy? Yeah we were, you know, we were happy sometimes. There is no happiness in trying to make someone who's unhappy happy. Sweetie, you're better off. Hm? All right. Thanks, mom. All right. I, uh, I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Bye, bye, bye, - Bye. - Okay, bye-bye. I mean, honey, I wanna be there with you. That's why I, um, I booked the place. For you and me. I mean, I wasn't planning on being here at all, you know? I was on my way to the train. My dad called. I was gonna stop by there and when I got there and I saw how, you know, scared they were, I just feel like it's the right thing to do. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. I am so glad you are out of the city. You're much safer out there. Yeah. Well how is it? You got wifi password and everything? Um, yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Well, I miss you. All right? Yeah, I miss you too. Goodnight. Goodnight. The numbers are still increasing. What are we doing? We're reducing the spread and increasing hospital capacity at the same. We are now working with hospitals to reconfigure the space in the hospital to get more beds and to find more staff. We're gathering ventilators. Ventilators are the most important piece of equipment and the piece of equipment that is most scarce. I remember the night I met my wife like it was yesterday. Most beautiful girl I ever saw. What's your name, sweetheart? I'm your granddaughter, June. June, like the bug. Junie? Remember Donna? I'm her daughter. I don't know you. That's okay. I know you. And I just wanted to say I love you, grandpa. Okay. Will you sing me that song again? Again? Okay. ♪ Blue moon ♪ ♪ I saw you standing alone ♪ ♪ Without a feel in your heart ♪ ♪ Without a love of my own ♪ ♪ Blue moon ♪ ♪ I saw you standing alone ♪ ♪ Without a dream in your heart ♪ ♪ Without a love of my own ♪ Bye. -Oh, so-sorry! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa, whoa! - Sorry! Oh my god. God. It's Carol from the office. Thank you to this man who inspires me? #Grateful? Do you think they're together? No, I do not think they're together. This is John we're talking about. He's like the nicest man I've ever met in my life. Well then why did she post it? She probably has a crush, which you need to get used to. You know... I know, but it's just, he did book us a house out of town and then he didn't show up, so. Look, you know how close he is with his family. I don't think he, like, did it on purpose to get you out of town. You know, things have been going good with you guys, right? I guess it's just, you know, my feelings are hurt. Okay, look, you just need to breathe. Take a deep breath, let it out, and just, you know? Like we're all super sensitive right now. - Yeah. - The whole world is just feeling like one big, emotional wound and you're, you know, by yourself with sheep and that fuckin' sucks. But I mean, do I really wanna be with somebody who doesn't wanna be with me during a fucking pandemic? You need to learn how to talk to him, babe. Like, you need to speak up. Well, maybe we're just growing apart. You know, maybe I created this fantasy that he can't live up to. This is John we're talking about. He's pragmatic, you know? He's a pragmatic individual and he really thinks things through before taking action. I just, I feel like I hate being always, always on his watch, you know? It's like, I'm not getting any younger. Okay, changing gears. How is the place? Um, it's good. I mean, there's somebody else here. Who is it? Well, some guy. Some guy? You're like in the wilderness alone with some guy in some random house? You are a lucky bitch. Like you might actually make a friend in the middle of this shit storm, you know? Like what other person can say that? You've reached Domino's. Due to the pandemic, we're closed. Hi, this is Papa John's. We're closed until further notice. Great. Hello, you've reached New Garden. In response to COVID, we are temporarily closed. Stay safe. Hey. Oh, hey. Sorry. Hi. I went out and got some food. Yeah, there's a Big Mac in there if you're hungry. Oh, really? Yeah. That's so nice of you. Um... I'm a vegan, or I'm trying to be. Oh, okay. I mean, it's good for the environment. Oh, cool. Well, yeah, there is some fries if you want those. Yep, whatever. Thank you. How long have you been a vegan? Hm... Um, my boyfriend and I started about a month ago? Mm-hm? He thought it would be healthier for us. I mean, I have to go out a lot for work, so I can't do it all the time, but I try. All right, cool. I don't usually look like this. Why, what do you usually look like? Well, I usually, you know, brush my hair and I do wear makeup. Right. No, I get it, I wear makeup, too. Oh. Sorry, that was a horrible joke. -I don't wear makeup. Bad joke. Okay. It wasn't bad. You don't need to wear makeup. Really? What do you do for a living? Uh, I kind of restore things. I, yeah, I just kind of repair things. Anything, really. Old motorcycles mainly, but just kind of old stuff. Really? Yeah, no, I have a shop downtown. Well it's shut down, but, yeah, I mainly work out of there. Huh. I haven't ridden for a long time. On motorcycles? You like motorcycles? I'm kind of scared to be honest. My grandfather likes to ride. Ah, cool. And he used to take me when I was little. - Ah, that's cool. - Mm-hm. Yeah, that's cool. Did he teach you how to ride yourself? No, I just rode in the back. Right. Hm. So, yeah, where are you from? Upper West Side. Remember? No, originally, where are you from? Originally? Indiana. - Mm. - Heard of it? Indiana, yes, I've heard of it. I have heard of it. Although I have not heard of an Indiana girl who preferred wine over beer, but... Well, I moved to the city after college and I've been there for a while. You know, just trying to create a new life for myself. How'd that work out? - Good. - Yeah? Yeah. I mean, I work in journalism. Um... I mean, I wanted to have at least one book written by now, but that hasn't happened yet. All right. It might. It could. And what did you write about? Oh, well, you know, I mean before all this COVID stuff, I was working very steadily writing food reviews. You went to college for that? Sorry that came out so wrong. -That sounded horrible. Like, horrible. No, you're right. You're right. I did. Let me say it again. Really, you went to college for that? Interesting. - And it sounds ridiculous. - That was horrible. And you know what? I'm still paying off my college loans. Oh, wow. - Still. - Fuck. - Yeah. - That's gotta suck. So you wanna play some Crazy Eights? Crazy what? What the fuck is Crazy Eights? What's that? - Crazy Eights. - What is Crazy Eights? You don't know what Crazy Eights is? No, I've never heard of it. Where are you from? I'm from New York. We play Blackjack and poker. I never heard of Crazy Eights. Well I, yeah, I grew up 10th and Avenue C. Oh, there's a really great fried chicken place over there. I wrote about it. All right. One of those pop ups? Yeah, they're good. They're good. Yeah, fuck, let's hope those places survive. Shit. Well, how long do you think this is gonna last? I dunno, you know, for, for New York to shut down like that? I would... I would say a while. Well, my work said two weeks. You know, sometimes I just think, like, you know, what the fuck, you know? Like, we're so conditioned every day to achieve things and to find the perfect mate, get the big apartment and to go to the best restaurants. And then the world shuts down and you're like, what was all that for? You know? The only thing that matters are essential workers and I'm not essential. All right, let me ask you. First of all, why are you doing that to yourself in the first place? -Well it just seems like a lot. That's a lot of pressure. I don't know, I guess, I guess it's just what I was taught. I mean, if you wanna have any sort of life that's worthwhile and valuable, you know, you have to break your back making it happen or devote all your time to a man that's gonna do it for you and with you and... That's a little, it's a little black and white to me. It is. Yeah. There's a lot of gray area in between that you're that you're not touching on that you're missing out on here. Yeah, like that's... Yeah. For a man. - What? - It's true. All right, personally, I don't give that much of a fuck about what people think about me. Obviously I care, but I just, you know, I know that people are gonna judge you no matter what so you might as well do what you want in life. You might as well just do what you want, 'cause I have seen enough shit to know that you gotta try and find something like happiness and not depend on anyone for fuckin' anything. Or at least try. - I want some of that. - You can have it. Oh my God. Do you want me to leave in the morning? Uh, no. I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to. - You sure? - No, yeah, of course. Yeah, you seem somewhat normal-ish? Honestly, do your thing. Whatever. All right, what's your favorite book? My favorite book? Yeah, your favorite book. Mm. No one's ever asked me that before. What? Really? You're, you're a writer. All writers read, don't they? Writers read. What's your favorite book? You know what, I love that book "Transit." I mean, it's not really plot driven. It's just, it's all of her connections with other people and I don't know, it just reveals a lot about what she's going through, right, and who she is, and I don't know. Just human connection. I like that sort of thing. Did they make a movie out of that book? - No? - No. -It sounds good. It does. How about you? What's your favorite book? Oh. Moby Dick. Oh, light reading. Yeah. Mm-hm. I like the adventure. I miss adventure. And I like a plot. -Like a big plot. Oh yeah. Hey, um just calling to see how your parents are doing and how you're doing. And I, um, I miss you. Okay, bye. Wearing a mask is now recommended by the CDC now that recent information shows how asymptomatic carriers of the coronavirus can infect others so easily. Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Well, they're saying we have to wear masks now. What? Yeah, they're saying the virus is, like, spreading through the air, so we have to wear face masks. That's what they're saying. Can I help? Yeah, sure, here. Yeah, cut me a piece outta that. Let me see. - Wait. - Can you see it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There. Here, try it on. - Is it over the nose? - Yeah, you gotta just cover all mouth, nose. -It's lightweight, aerodynamic. It's fashionable, looks great with any outfit. Let's see it. Adorbs. All right. It's cool. Flatten the curve, flatten the curve, flatten the curve. I don't believe we're going to be able to flatten the curve enough to meet the capacity of the healthcare system. Mm, oh my god. I forgot how good these are. Mm-hm. I guess I don't have to worry about being a vegan tonight. No, you shouldn't have to worry about it. No, just be yourself. If you want to be a vegan, be a vegan. If you don't, you know, eat a fuckin' Big Mac. Yeah, you're right. But you know, when you spend so much time with somebody, you can sort of start to mold into the same person. You know? Like you start to like all the same things and dislike all the same things. Yeah, but like, aren't you just dating yourself at a certain point? Hm. Maybe. I mean, is that to make you happy or is that to make them happy? Maybe neither. But you're right. I mean, if you become the same person, then, you are sort of dating yourself. Yeah, or losing yourself. Yeah, I mean, I guess that can depend on the dynamic. I mean, you know, if two people really dig each other and they hold onto their own identities, then sure, you know, I think of course two people can grow together and they can have fun together, have a meaningful relationship. Fuck, what do I know, you know? Hey, it's Ev. You have some stuff here and you can pick it up sooner than later. Bye. Oh, wow. Charlie. Uh, yeah? Yeah? You wanna karaoke? God no. Come on. That's the worst idea I've ever heard. It'll be fun. I order things when I'm nervous. Oh the suspense is killing me.

So what is your favorite television show to binge watch 'cause we're gonna have a lot of time now. Oh, a TV show to binge?

You know, it just, just is what it is. You know what I mean? Like... I love it. It's perfect. You know, this reminds me of this place in Florida that my mom took me and my brother to right after my dad passed. Yeah, she wanted us to experience the beach down south. You know, we spent an entire summer in a place like this, room two. It's really beautiful. Yeah, it was cool. You know, it was probably like one of the best times the three of us had together. Yeah, beautiful. Hey, you know what, if shit really did hit the fan, like seriously hit the fan, like the world was gonna end, I would totally hide out here. Yeah? All right. Here, one of you. - No. - Yeah. Look at the camera. Smile, wave. There it is. No, he was just the best, you know? Like, he raised me since I was about three. Right. Yeah, my parents split up not long after I was born. And I guess my dad was fine, you know? And then he got laid off and then he started to lose it and he got really jealous and paranoid and he, I guess, came over to our house one night and luckily I was asleep and it was not his visitation night and he came over anyway and my mom went outside in the driveway and, um, yeah, he shot her and then shot himself. It's like what you think happens to everybody else - until it happens to you. - Damn. That's... But my grandpa just stepped in. Like, didn't even think about it, you know? He just stepped in. He taught me how to brush my teeth, how to tie my shoes. Bought me knee socks. He played Barbies with me. Like who does that? That's heroic, actually. It's heroic. That moment alone was heroic. He was your guy. - He was my guy. - He was your guy. He taught me fractions. Yeah, he sounds great. But you know what's fucked up? Like, I don't know, I mean I wasn't there when my parents died and I wasn't there when my grandpa passed. Like I never got to say goodbye. What about you? Did you, um, did you get to say goodbye to your dad? I did, yeah. I did. Yeah. Didn't make it any less complicated, but I, you know, I did at least get that. Well, I guess we have a lot to be grateful for, you know? I mean, it's like we have our health. And yeah, we have pretty nice lives. Yeah, gratitude's important. Yeah, but you know, I'm not sure emotional pain kind of works like that, you know? That kind of suffering is it's still suffering no matter where you come from or who you are. You know, if it hurts, it hurts. Yeah. Not many people say that. It's nice to... Talk. No, it is. It is. I don't open up enough, so it's... Yeah, it feels nice. So tell me about you. Uh-oh. What happened in the car? What do you mean? In the car when you got some message and you deflated like a balloon. - I did not. - A little bit. Not for the first time. I had a relationship that fucking tanked and uh, yeah, it's, come on, man, it's not that interesting. Definitely not. A while back, I got a pocket dial, you know, a voice message thing. And it was from my girlfriend's phone and I heard my girlfriend telling her friend about how she cheats on me. Yeah, not cheat, cheats. That's an important detail. Like routinely? Like it's part of her daily schedule? No, like the whole scam, the whole way she worked it. How to pull it off, how to get away with it, what you can do, what you shouldn't do, what you should do. Like, it-it was calculated and horrible and my jaw was just like on the floor and I thought it was a joke. Ew. Who does that? I know. I asked her, you know, and she just kind of laughed it off. It made me feel like an idiot for, like, even bringing it up or asking. Oh, so she decided to gaslight you? Yeah, you know, she made me feel like I was all messed up for like even mentioning it even though I had this full, hard evidence recording of her saying it out loud to her friends. You know, I tried to forget about it and I did, I tried, but you can't forget about that stuff. You can't. Once it's in your head, you can't get rid of it. You know, then she starts picking all these stupid fights, like these pointless arguments just to cause problems. And then she's like really awesome and nice and she's warm and fuzzy and it's great. And then she's like cold and distant and you know, eventually she stops responding to my texts and my calls and then she sends me this like cold, like ice cold text saying that it's over and that she didn't want to do it anymore. I'm like whoa, like... Ow. Ow. I'm so sorry. That's horrible. Yeah, well, thank you. I'm not trying to change the subject, I'm really not, but I think I may have just like landed the perfect s'mores. -Do you see how it's- -Ooh, it's drippy. - I want one. - Off like spike here? That tells me that it's like the perfect, perfect time to get on it. Oh yeah. - Oh yeah. - Watch your fingers. - Don't burn 'em. - I'm not. Oh yeah. This is good. You see that? Look. - Mm. - Not too burnt. Incredible. - Hey June? - Yeah? - June? - What? Here, check it out. Look what I found. Are we allowed to use it? I actually don't know but who cares? We're we're in a lockdown. Who cares? I'll be right out. Yeah well hurry you up. - Come on, hurry up. - Okay. That's really good. What? Did you go to art school or something? No, God no. No, I mean, I took a few art classes after school. My mom was trying to keep us busy, but I mean, no, not really. How is your mom? My mom? Mm-hm. Yeah, she's, she's good, I think. Maybe we should call her. What, you want to call my mom? Yeah, check on her. Oh. Hey ma, just checking in. How are ya? Eh, managing. Yeah. Look, I want you to meet somebody. I want you to meet June. Hi. Hi, June. Where are you from? I'm from the city. Yeah, we're locked down together, mom. So we're keeping each other company. - We are. - My goodness. Aren't you two lucky young people. Yeah, so how you doin'? You doin' okay? What's going on? What's shakin'? I'm fine. The building isn't letting anybody in who doesn't live here, so of course Jean came over to have our weekly supper together and they wouldn't let her in. So it's just, it's hard to give up your rituals. What are you guys up to? What are we doing? We're painting. We're painting. The house? No, not the house. That's what I said. No, not the house. We're doing masterpieces right here. - Isn't that beautiful? - Oh, beautiful. Isn't that amazing? Look, we just wanted to say hi. We're checking in. I wanted you to meet June, June, I wanted you to meet my mom. - Nice meeting you. - There it is. Can't believe this, it's so weird, but there it is. Yeah, we're gonna sign out, ma, okay? So sweet. Thank you so much for giving a ring. It's so good to see both of you. Nice to meet you, June. Nice meeting you. Bye ma, love you. I love you too, sweetheart. Love you. All right. There it is. We did it. Damn, you're actually really beautiful. How old were you? - 17. - 17? That's... Amateur. That's not that old, actually. Amateur, just like, totally amateur. You'll learn the ways, like when you've been doing it as long as I have. -Thank you. You'll figure it out. Wait, did you order pizza for breakfast? Yeah. Postmates, actually. - Oh, nice. - Mm-hm, mm-hm. Should... Do you think that's a owner? Liz. Oh, god. She's crazy. You should get it. Hey. Hey, can I help you? Um, who are you? I'm Charlie. Who are you? I must have the wrong house. Oh, okay, what house were you looking for? This is strange. John. June. What the fuck is going on? Yeah, no, there were- Why don't we just have... Let's talk. What's going on, June? Well I, I left you a message. Yeah, I got that. I thought you were hurting. I didn't think that you had moved on. I was hurting. Okay. Well I'm sorry that I stayed. I said that I was gonna make it up to you and you said that you understood. Yeah, I know. Look, we've been together for a year and you can't even talk to me? You leave me messages and you don't even take my calls? Look, this is just a really hard time. Yeah, I know it's a hard time, that's why I'm here. Well, now you're here. The world shuts down and you leave me. Baby, you don't know how I feel about you? Have I not told you enough? Have I not been there enough for you? Talk to me. I don't know. Yes, I mean, you've been there. John... I'm just... Look, I'm just scared, okay? It's a really scary time. I mean, Jesus, it feels like the fucking world is ending. It's falling apart. But it doesn't mean that we have to. We've been together for a year. We've shared our lives together. We've been through two major trials. Holidays and just regular days. Look at me. We are real. Yeah, but we haven't experienced this intense time. Look, what matters is that we're here together now and we can move forward. Look sometimes when, when things are really stressful and we can't think clearly, we can become vulnerable in certain situations. And you know what? I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, ma. Hey, how you doing? You okay? Yeah, I'm good. I'm just working on next week's lesson plan. How are you? Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm fine. They're doing this food program in the building and you pick a elderly person's name and you can go out and buy groceries for them so they don't have to go out. You know, maybe you could see if they're doing that kind of thing in your building because it feels so nice and right now we really should be looking out for one another, right? Oh, definitely, of course. So when are you coming back? It's funny. It's, um... It's kind of hard for me to say out loud, but we just lost... My dad. What? From COVID? Oh yeah. I'm so sorry. What's eating me up is that we can't even give him a funeral. Man. -I lost- -Mom is devastated. Um... When did it happen? Three days ago. You know, he wasn't feeling well and he went into the hospital. There wasn't enough beds and 24 hours later, he was gone. I needed to see you. Yeah, you know what? I'm not even, I'm not even worried, you know? I've got a bunch of savings, so I'm okay. I'm good. Charlie, you still didn't answer my question. When can I see you? Charlie? Yeah, I'm probably gonna head back today. Okay. Charlie... Charlie? Can you wait? So, so what's going on? Is he staying or? No, no, I mean, well, yes, but it's really complicated. His dad just died and I feel terrible. It's cool, I get it. Yeah. Get what? Fuckin', I just, I don't know, I thought you guys were fucking done or something, so- No we are. We were. Yeah well he's right in there. We might still be, but his father just died. He doesn't have anybody. Yeah, all right. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. - It's fine. - I'm so sorry. Hey, you know what? It's all okay, it's all good. Real life just came knocking, so it's what happens. It's okay. It's not okay. All right, look, I need you to do me a favor. What? All right, you gotta promise not to forget yourself. Just don't forget yourself. You know what I mean? All right, bye. What the fuck do you want? Bye, Charlie. Yeah, bye. I'll see ya. I see a lot of ingredients but no food. We have to cook. You know I don't cook. Well, we could try to cook together. No, I'm not good at it. Just do my usual. I know you're gonna come up with somethin'. - Hey, Charlie. - Hey, Richie. Yeah, it's good to see ya. Hey. Surprise. What's this? I forgot how much I love Indian food. Your favorite. John, how did you get this? Uber Eats is a client of ours, so they're still delivering. Hey sweetie. Hey. - How are you? - Good. Where were you? The shower. Oh. No, before that. I woke up and you weren't here. Oh. I went for a bike ride. When did you start bike riding? I've always ridden bikes. I've never seen you ride a bike. Well, I wanted some fresh air. How's work? Well, they just closed down the courthouse so obviously I can't see new clients, so it's slow, and I'm just doing a little house keeping on these pending cases. And the new assistant? She's good. You know, but we may have to let go all the assistants, you know, depending on how this, you know, how long this pandemic lasts. Well, my work said that it would be a month without pay and I haven't gotten any new updates. Well, honey, it's gonna be longer than that. Well, that's why I started writing. Hmm. Well, you know what? You're gonna be fine. Okay? You're gonna be fine, you have nothing to worry about, 'cause I'm gonna take care of you. Okay? 100%. Plus, you know, it was a dead end job, anyway. What? Honey, magazines and newspapers are dying. Yeah, but there's online and I did have a following. Not compared to Yelp. That's not nice. I'm just... Honey, I'm just stating the facts. June, I'm not trying to upset you. Maybe you can start a cookbook. A cookbook? Yes. You write restaurant reviews. People trust you. That's big. And food brings people together. That's a beautiful thing. Don't underestimate that, hon. I'll think about it. All right, all right, listen to me. People are gonna be home for a while. You know a cookbook will bring people hope and comfort. True. Yeah. What? Nothing. You're right. People are gonna wanna cook, they're not gonna wanna read a novel. Wait, you gonna write a novel? No. I don't know. Um... No, I write food reviews and that's a big leap to writing novels. You know what? I think I'm gonna, um... Think I'm gonna go for a walk. Okay. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Hey. Hey. You wanna come to bed? Um, I'm gonna finish this movie. Hey. What's with the bags? My mom is back at her apartment by herself so I thought we should be there with her. My grandpa died. It was about a week ago. June, I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me? It's just a... Stressful time. Yeah. Honey, I get that. I know we've never gone through this before. Yeah. I'm thinking that we're not what each other needs right now. I gotta go. The big picture is the situation is painfully clear now. The public has to be responsible. Stay at home. I know the isolation can be boring and oppressive. It is better than the alternative. As governor of New York, I am asking healthcare professionals across the country, if you don't have a healthcare crisis in your community, please come help us in New York now. Hey, ma? Charlie. Ma? Hi honey. - Where are? - Where are you? Well, I just went out for a little walk in the neighborhood. Well I came by the house. You're not there. I'm just walking around. I'm trying to find you.

I love you. Love you too, Charlie. - You ride safe. - I will. If you're sick, stay home. We need to reduce the... Oh, god. And we need federal government to actually help rather than hinder. Tell the American people the truth. We don't have enough tests. We can't test everybody who wants a test. We don't have the capacity. 3,000 fatalities. We have 108 cases in New York. We only have... The real danger is twofold. One, if it continues to spread, we're going to have to take drastic containment measures, which means you basically shut down everything, which is what China did. That's bad for the economy... Hi. Hey. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. Really? Yeah. Well I wanted to see you, too. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Oh God. I think I love you. I do.
