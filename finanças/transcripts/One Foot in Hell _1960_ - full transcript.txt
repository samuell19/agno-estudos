Mitch! Mitch! Oh, please, Mitch. Hurry. The more you're jostled around, the quicker the baby comes. I don't care, Mitch. Please hurry. All right, then. Let me help you, Ellie. Here. That's the girl. You'll have a doctor in a few minutes. All right, all right. Now stop that racket. Sorry, mister. My wife's very sick.What's the matter with her? I-It's her time. Could we have a room, please? Oh, now don't get your tail flappin'. She's not the only woman ever to birth a baby. Room 8, upstairs to your right.Oh, thanks. That'll be two dollars.I'll pay you later, after I get her to bed. You'll pay me now. Rules of the hotel. Mitch!It's all right, honey. Please get me a doctor.I can't leave the premises. Doc Seltzer lives up the street, the other side. Come on, honey. Oh, Mitch. Mitch. Try to rest. I'll get the doctor. Be right back. She's a real sick girl, mister. You go wake Sam Giller at the general store... and get this medicine.Yes, sir. Y'all feel like yellin', ma'am, you go right ahead and yell. Don't even try to hold it back. This town's too quiet anyway. Or maybe-- Maybe if we talk, it'll help. You like to talk, ma'am? Yes. Hurry, mister, please hurry. She's very sick. And they say, "Haste makes waste." Never truer than a situation like this. Have to pour real careful like... or no tellin' what's goin' to happen. You realize that?Yes, but hurry, please. I'm comin', comin'. That'll be $1.87.Sure. The hotel took all my money. I'll pay you tomorrow. Oh, no. Wakin' me out of bed, expecting credit... when I never even saw you before in my whole life? I'll pay you tomorrow on my word of honor. Can't feed my family on a stranger's word of honor. You tell Doc Seltzer, if he wants credit, let him come in and ask for it. Look, I've got a pair of mules down there and a wagon in front of the hotel. You keep 'em till I pay you.Mules and a wagon for $1.87? Where did you steal 'em, Reb? Give me that medicine.Yeah, sure. Of course. Didn't mean any offense. Here. Take it. Help! Sheriff! Sheriff! Stop him, Sheriff. Help! Hold on there, mister! This medicine. It's for my wife. He's got a gun, Ole. A gun. Please, Sheriff. Please don't. My wife--Go on inside. Go on, move! Move before I put a hole through ya. He robbed me, Ole. He held a gun on me. This medicine-- The doctor sent me for it. Simmer down. Now get over to these posters so's I can get a good look at ya. What else'd he take, Sam?Taking it at the point of a gun. That's the main thing. Nobody's got a right--I meant no harm. My wife is sick at the hotel. She's gonna have a baby. Please, Sheriff, let me go. I gotta get this medicine to her. All right. Let's go have a look.Thank you. You walk in front of me.Thank you. George?Oh. This man stayin' here?Woke me up and checked in a while ago. Room 8. All right. Go on.What'd he do? Well, he threatened Sam with a gun, for one thing. The sheriff stopped me. Here's the medicine. Sorry. Medicine's no use now. She died a couple of minutes ago. A dollar and... 87 cents. Ellie! God, Ellie. "All the way from Atlanta," she said. They were burned out in the war. The two of them-- should've been three-- wanted to start a new life. Came all the way west, here, to us. To us, my hospitable friends-- That's a long way to come... just to lay down and die. I'll see her grave's looked after, Mitch. Thank you. Why don't you stay here, Mitch? Give the town another chance. Yeah. Same chance they gave Ellie. Sure, sure. I know. I don't think your wife would feel that way. Maybe she might rest more peacefully if she knew you were settling down-- Save your preaching, will you?That's not preaching. That's not my kind of thing, Mitch. I'm just trying to make sense. Now the town's offering you a choice of jobs: anything from banking to store clerking to deputy sheriffing. You're-- You're wasting your time. So look, I got-- I got lots of it to waste. You see, Mitch, I want you to change your mind. I want folks around here to have another chance from you. I like them. I like this town. Now you can't blame me for that, can you? No, I'm not blaming you for anything. This is a fine place to light, Mitch. Where else would you get a choice of jobs?Yeah, I know. Now, uh, personally, I'd, uh-- I'd recommend between bank and sheriff. They pay about the same. But it's a matter of whether a man likes sittin' down while he's working... or movin' around where there's more excitement. "That I will uphold the laws of Arizona Territory at all times"-- That I will uphold the laws of Arizona Territory at all times-- That's fine. Wonderful. Anything I can do for you at any time, boy, let me know. Thank you. Sure wish you'd taken that job with me, Mitch.This is fine, Mitch, just fine. Ole.Mark. Mitch. Right away. Coffee?Had my rations a while back. Shake hands with our bread and butter, Mark Dobbs. Buys all our cattle. This is my new deputy, Mitch Barrett. Nice to meet you, Barrett.Well, thanks. Sure bought yourself a handful of cattle this trip. More than $80,000 worth. I'm making your town healthy rich. Be back as soon as we lock up this loot in the bank. See you in September, Barrett. Hello. Hi, Frank.Hi, Mitch. Been keepin' you busy, Mitch?You tell 'im, Mitch. How's it goin', Mitch? Hot and dusty. Would-- Would anybody want their picture sketched? Hit the trail, panhandler. Draw your pictures somewhere else. Listen. I gotta have a drink. I just gotta. I got money. I'll pay you later. You don't get nothin' unless I see some money sittin' on that bar. Money. But I tell ya, I got money. I got two years' lieutenant's pay comin' to me. I was a lieutenant in the Virginia 44th. I fought. Did you fight? Any of you? Did any of you fight? Took everything we had-- our homes and our land-- everything. But did any of you fight? Oh-ho, no. You didn't fight. Money? Huh. Why you're just nothin' but poor white trash to me. I had 50 better than you plowin' my fields. Fifty! I'm gonna bust your head wide open. Come on. Come on! Nobody chases me. I made the Yankees back up at Manassas and again at Shenandoah. But nobody makes meback up. Come on. You hear me? Come on. You yellow-bellied hunk o' trash. Better go sleep it off, soldier. You make a lot of noise for one drink. Whiskey and a glass. The war is over. Well. How about this? Thank you. Take a look, everybody. We have a gentleman among us. All right, sir. I'll drink this to you, then I'll take care of your yellow-bellied friend. What does he owe you?A bottle of whiskey. We'll keep him jugged until he pays up. He's pretty good. Come on, Scotty. Help me, will ya? That's it. Up, boy. Let's go. Don't make practical sense, Mitch. Can't go gettin' soft for every saddle tramp drifts into town. Yeah, but he's different. He's got talent. Yep, for drinkin'. You mean that you're really gonna put up two bucks of your own money... for that stew bum in there? Maybe so. I'll see. All right, Santa Claus. I'm goin' down to Sam Giller's, see if he's got a shipment of them new repeatin' rifles. You know, I told the sheriff I'd pay your freight out of jail. You see, I was at Manassas and Shenandoah too. Third Cavalry. Hoorah for our side. Hoorah, hoorah, hoora-a-ah! Virginia, 44th. They used a lot of liquid fire, didn't they? We burned more Yankee bottoms than you can count. Y-You got a drink on you, mister? You know how to put it together? What?Liquid fire. How do you think I got to be a lieutenant in the 44th? What are you gonna do when you get out of here? Me? I'm gonna buy me a railroad. - No, no. No, no. - No railroads for me. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna build me a whole herd of boats-- lots and lots of boats in little, little bottles-- Big, big boats in little, little bottles. Ah, this place stinks. You hear me? It stinks-- dirty, rotten, filthy stink. Hey, everybody! Hey, this place stinks! You hear me, everybody? It stinks! It stinks! Keats.Yeah? Lots of good men had it tougher than you, but they went on living. They didn't lay down and try to die. Don't you preach to me, mister. I don't cotton to no preachin'. My folks worked their lives out tryin' to make something out of a lot of worn-out dirt... nobody else would spit on. They farmed that land with their hands because they didn't have tools. And they built a home too, and a good 'un. They didn't rest until they had a place that people would point to... and say, "That there's the Keats' place." You know what was left of that place when I come back from the war? It was right back to dirt again. Not a piece of wood there that-- that was not burnt. And there wasn't a crop there left standin', not-- not one little thing-- not so much to show for 30 years of work and sweat. So don't you start preachin' to me, mister, because I don't want nobody preachin' to me! I'm not preaching, Keats. You know, I had a farm like yours once, before the Yanks came in. So, while I'm not preaching, did you ever dream of rebuilding your place... so the grass is green, the color back in the ground? When you got enough whiskey, you don't have to dream... about things not worth dreamin'. You know, I read something a long time ago: "Follow the rainbow, but don't wait for the gold at the end." "Look for the silver in between." - Yeah, I know. - I went to school once too. So what are you? Are you some kind of a do-gooder or somethin'? You wanna save my soul, mister?No, I want a few men... with anger and guts enough to follow that rainbow and grab a pot full of gold-- not petty silver in between. Gold enough to... build five farms. What kind of a pitch is this? You talk too much crazy talk, mister. Oh, no. What I gotta do, I'm gonna do myself, my own way. Please, just leave me be, will you, mister? Get outta here. Sure, I'll do that. But it's Yankee gold. When they burned your farm, what'd they do-- burn your guts out too? W-Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're wasting my time.Did you say, "Yankee gold"? Yes, $100,000's worth. Right in this town. That's kinda funny talk from a lawman-- tryin' to take his own town. Now look who's preaching. Wearing this tin star doesn't change my feelings about this town. What are you tellin' me all this for?Because I need help. I need somebody who can sketch-- make detailed plans-- and somebody who knows how to put together liquid fire. Somebody who can give and take orders. Tryin' to make me feel important, mister? You've got to feel important, or you're no use to us. Are you with us or not? I don't know. I never figured on anything like this. What do you figure on? Getting your place back or... rotting here in jail and feeling sorry for yourself? Shut up.You know any better way to get healthy... than by using Yankee money? No, I reckon not. What about it? Do I buy you out of here or no? Well, mister, you just hired yourself a man. Sofa's yours. Well. Who's the gal? It's my wife. You didn't say there's a Mrs. Barrett. She's dead. Oh. I'm sorry. Doesn't happen to be a... small drink around here anyplace, does there? In the cabinet. Ride into town whenever you have to. Study Main Street-- every window, post-- everything. That's easy enough. But stay out of the saloons. Who, me? Oh, home drinkin' just suits me fine. Just be reasonable. Sure. Soon as you can, get me a list of what you need for liquid fire. Kerosene, percussion caps, bottles-- That's all.Fine. I'll pick 'em up in easy stages at Grand Forks and Hempstead. You know somethin'? The way you plan things-- sort of slow and careful-- you must want that money awful bad. Not as much as I once wanted $1.87. Rustled them right from under my nose. Six of my best. Not long ago. They drove 'em for the pass. Let's go.Won't need you, Sim. You stay and tend to your chores. I ain't a-scared to go along.Last thing in the world we'd be thinkin'. Only two rustlers in on this. Hardly enough for Mitch and me to do. We'll be seeing you right quick. Night's movin' in pretty fast.We got 'em, Ole. Tracks are fresh as daisies. Come on, boy. All right, boys. Stand up and come out high! How 'bout you, mister? You ready to come out? Soon be dark enough for him to break out. I'm gonna climb down. Keep him busy. All finished, Ole. Don't let killin' them two upset you none. They had a rope waitin' for 'em anyway. I'm not bothered about them. I was just thinking about my first night in Blue Springs. No sense thinkin' about the past. I try not to, but it doesn't put me to sleep. Mitch, I can't tell you how many times I've been ashamed of that night. Every time I used to go to the graveyard, I'd tell Ellie how ashamed you and... Giller and Caldwell were. That ain't fair. If there was anything I could do to change things, don't you think I would? Oh, sure. But you should've known her. She was so pretty. She loved to laugh. You know, I loved every minute of being with her. She wanted that baby so bad. Mitch, you gotta stop talkin' that way. This happened a long time ago. You gotta try and forget. I aim to... the only way I know how. Yeah, but Mitch, you-- Mitch, don't. You're crazy. You don't know what-- You don't know what you're doin'. Ellie screamed. Why don't you scream? No. Oh, no. The horses are hobbled in Mesa Canyon. No horses are worth this. Nothing is worth this. It's our job. You'd better take a shovel. I didn't bury the rustlers. Sorry, Mitch. I know how you felt about Ole. No, I don't think so. Nobody will ever know that. That I will uphold the laws of Arizona Territory at all times-- "So help me God."So help me God. Congratulations, Sheriff. You're gonna do a wonderful job. This is the sketch you wanted me to draw for you, Sheriff. Caught me lookin' my natural best. How's about letting it hang in my store, Mitch?No sale. Say, young fella, what'll you charge to do a picture of me-- just me alone? Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Mr. Giller. I don't think folks would stand... for two likenesses of you in one town. You see? Now you can't just lob it in there soft like. You gotta slam it in there real hard. Watch. You try one. Fine job, Dan. Good enough for a drink or two?Sure, in my saddlebag. Well, everything's set on this end. Now we tie up the other end. Where's that? The border-- Royce City. That hellhole? There's nothin' there but lice. That's what we're lookin' for, isn't it? Human lice? Present company not excepted. Right. You take the wagon and paintings, and I'll meet you in four days in Royce City.

I'm the girl you told folks about back in Blue Springs-- the bride you're bringing back from St. Louis. My friend has dreams when he's drunk. You'd be surprised at the dreams I hear and the offers I get. You're wasting your time listening to this one. I wonder if they'd think so back in Blue Springs? I mean the people who run the bank.

It isn't gonna work.Look, Mr. Barrett, I happen to need this break badly enough to do anything to get it. Anything. I have to have a chance to get enough money together to leave places like this. And when it's over, I'll head east. I promise you that. I dream too, Mr. Barrett. Someday I'll start living brand-new... in a place where no one ever heard of Julie Reynolds. Find some other way.

You get on your horse and go to my place. Lieutenant. You and me are gonna get together again real soon. I'll be lookin' forward to that. How much longer we gotta wait? Until Saturday. Four more days. I want you to rehearse until you know all the answers. The big one's all that matters to me: When do we divvy the 100,000? When it's safe, in about a week... and when I've convinced the posse the chase is hopeless. After the robbery, you go to the miner's cabin up over the ridge... and wait for me. Harry, you go the hotel in Basin City. And get out of that clown outfit. I'm anything and everything I have to be to get this job over with. What about the money? Who becomes custodian? It'll be here with Julie, Dan and myself. Why here? Because anyplace I own, the posse won't look. I've got a picture for you to study. Be right back. Well, if nothing else, we're becoming art students. What difference does it make? What he says goes. He's smart.Madmen frequently are. Him mad? I should be that crazy. Wouldn't surprise me at all. Don't mention this one to Keats. Some things he hasn't any stomach for. Yeah. Lots of things. I aim to find out what they are. You do what you like after this is over. That's your business. This is a painting he made of a sketch when I was sworn in. Stu, this is your man. He's the hotel man, Caldwell. I want you to get to know his face as well as you know your own gun. This one's your study, Harry: Sam Giller, runs the general store. You haven't too much time. The cattle have been rounded up and are heading toward town. We wait 10 minutes and then we move in behind the bank. Good morning, sir.Good morning. Well, what can I do for you, mister?Just passing through. I promised my sister I'd give her a gift. A gun. Sure thing. You came to the right place. You were recommended by your sheriff.Mitch? One of my closest friends.Really? Amazing. Simply amazing. Something smallish. My sister has a certain delicacy. Mm-hmm. Got a dandy. Here you are. Sixteen dollars. Hmm. That'd be $16 plus $1.87, won't it? What?Your close friend, Mitch Barrett, asked me to pay what he's owed you for so long-- ever since the death of his wife. One dollar and 87 cents, wasn't it? What are you doing that for, mister?Hand sweat. Oh.Nice-lookin' beef. Yeah, we raise the finest in the country. The noisiest too. I guess we'd yell some too if we was headin' for the slaughterhouse. That's right. Never thought of that before. Wish I had time to hear you yell. Stampede!Come on! Let Harry in the back door. - Don't do it, Mitch. Don't. - A hundred thousand dollars. Town's bread and butter. Best kind of swap I could make for $1.87. We got it all.All right, boys. Give me the liquid fire stuff. Hightail outta here. Stu! You forgot something. Oh yeah. Gotta make you look like a hero for the neighbors. So long, Mitch. How long you gonna be with us, Mr. Lancaster? As briefly as I find endurable. Have the saddlebags moved to my quarters while I seek some refreshments. Before I swear the posse in, there's a couple of things I wanna say. This town has been hit hard. We're broke. And four men are dead. Any man who's in this just for an exciting day or two can step out. I don't want him. All right. Let's get on with it. Raise your right hand. Do you have to come bargin' in like that? What do you want me to do, whistle six bars of "Dixie"? I'm sorry. I-- I guess that all waitin' and no whiskey is makin' Dan a dull boy. I got the best cure in the world for that. Oh, you do? What?In the shed. You pick up that ax, start chopping some wood, and then I can iron those clothes. Okay, Doctor. Anything you say. Ho! Ho.Ho. Take half the men, Doc. We'll meet you on the other side. Search all the caves and anything that looks like a hideout. All right, boys. Come on. Follow me. Bye, Doc.Good-bye. Eating time! I'm on my way! How much are you gonna chop? We already have enough to last a month. Why this is just like old times. I used to chop maybe about one or two cords at a time back home. Mmm! Smells good. What is it?Wash up and find out. Hey! You're dripping water all over the clean floor. I'm sorry. Did I get you wet?No. Put your shirt on. No gentleman comes to the table half-dressed. Just brushing up on some manners I used to have. While I'm on that subject, I-- There's something else. That-- That cheap talk that I made to you a while back... about your-- about your not being a lady. I know what I am. Well, I was drunk as a skunk. And a lot meaner. This isn't why I brought it up now, but I just wanted to say to you that... I have never known any girl... that's much of a lady as you are, Julie. Not anytime or anyplace. That's a very nice thing for you to say. No nicer than you. Look, we better eat. Thing's will get cold. The men are pretty beat. Yeah. It's kinda rough on 'em. It's rougher on you with a... bride waitin' at home. Oh, excuse it. I-- I didn't mean to make smart talk. Doc. About Julie and me. She doesn't like the house. She doesn't like the town. She doesn't like anything. Including me. She's threatening to go back east. I-- I'm real sorry to hear that, Mitch. Maybe, uh-- Maybe you want me to talk to her. No. No, I don't want that. I don't want her to change her mind... because somebody talked her into it. I-I just couldn't live with it, Doc. I know. Well, maybe she'll come around in a little bit. Yeah. If she does, I'll-- I'll be waiting. What's that for?Habit, I guess. Posse quit? Almost. They're searching the ridge.Here? Nah, there's nothin' to worry about. When I lead them this way, you'll be over the ridge and back to my cabin. Coffee hot? I don't like riding these hills with a posse loose. Too bad your mind isn't as quick as your gun. If anybody catches up with you, you're a trail rider.Yeah. I guess that figures. Then get started. I'll cover your tracks and join the posse. Gray belly at your place? Yeah, with Julie. I wanna keep him in one piece until we split the money. A hundred thousand dollars. That's a nice thought to keep me company on the ride across. Get goin'. Mitch! Mitch! You shouldn't have taken this chance. Only way I could be certain he was one of them. And he sure hits hard.Here. Let me take a look at ya. Hurry up, Doc. He's still alive. Who are the others with you? Come on, boy. Square yourself. Tell the truth. What? Basin City? Who's there? Who?It's no use, Mitch. He's dead. Too bad. Thought he was gonna tell us more. All right. We'll comb Basin City tomorrow. You know somethin', Julie? These past few days, bein' here with you-- they've been good days. I know. I was hopin' they'd never end. We'd better be gettin' back. Mitch might be coming. Don't run away from me, Julie. Please, don't. What's the crazy sense of talkin', Dan? It's too late for that or anything else. No! It isn't. We been runnin' away all our lives. Runnin' from other people, from ourselves. When are we gonna stop? Not till I get far enough away so that nobody'll know me, anything about me. That's all I want, Dan. I don't believe that, Julie. I think what you want is what we've had right here together. You've been happy. I know you've been happy. It'll be over soon. That's the way it's gotta be. Julie, listen to me. Look at me, Julie. I-I haven't had a drop of liquor since I've been here, have I? And I didn't mind it a bit, did I? That's just because of you. It's because I wanted to be right with ya. I wanted to be with ya. I love you, Julie. I love you. And I know that past anything else in the world, I love you. Aw, Dan. Stop it, will you? Listen to me and try to understand something. Being here with you is probably... the only true happiness that I've ever known. Dan, you don't really love me. Julie, now youstop. Stop being ashamed for what's past. I wanna have a new life with you. Just you and me. Well, there's some things you don't scrub off. Do you remember that night in Royce City when that man, Luke, grabbed me? Do you remember he started to say something about my father? Well, I never saw my father one sober day of his life. Not one. When he didn't have money for liquor, then he needed me. It's nice to be needed. He brought his friends to the house. And they liked me. Honey. Honey, don't. Don't. Julie, Julie. I love you. I love you. Listen. Listen to me. Back home where I come from-- that's-- that's deep in Virginia-- I still got a piece of land there. I'm gonna work that piece of land with my two hands. And I want your two hands with me, workin' it with me. We'll turn that earth, plow, and we'll plant. And we won't stop until we have a place that we can be really proud of-- a place that folks'll look at and say, "There's the Keats' place." We're together now for always and always.Yes. Yes. I'm gonna ride into town and talk to Mitch. What we gotta do now, we can do for ourselves. We're gonna start fresh and clean. We'll let the others keep the money. You don't want the money, do ya, Julie? Oh, no. I've got what I've always wanted... all my life, right here. Just got two of 'em. Who gunned 'em, Jonesey? Mitch. Went in after 'em single-handed while we backed him up. A couple of you men, uh, take 'em around to the rear. Say, Doc. Where's Mitch?Runnin' down the hideout of the others. Look, I told you. He went to town. I told both of you to stay put. But why are you so upset? He'll be back. You think so?I know so. Probably on his way to Virginia by now. And it won't be funny for him when I catch up with him. Look, I told ya he'd be back, all right? You sound like a protective mother. Or is "mother" the wrong word for it? We're in love. That's what he went into town to tell you. When he finds out that you're not there, he'll come back, Mitch. He'll find out other things too. Stu and Ivers are dead. Dead? How? With you leading the posse, Mitch, how? With me leading the posse. Oh, Dan. He can't hear ya.He'll come back. He'll come back, Mitch.His kinda people never change. I told you. I told-- One sound out of you and I'll kill him from here. Dan! Dan, stop! Mitch is-- Throw your gun out, Keats, or I'll kill her right now. Now come on in. That's far enough. You must've drunk a pint of guts to ride up here. The money's all yours, Mitch. We don't want a penny of it. The money's not yours to want. At least let Julie go. She can't hurt ya any. That's not what I planned. She was tired of living, just as you were tired. I hired a lot of tired people. The scum of the earth. What about after us, Mitch? You didn't tell us about wanting to kill all those people in town. Innocent people. Good people. You got rid of everybody that ever touched you, everybody that loved ya, that wanted to help ya. How you gonna live now? How you gonna live without anybody to hate? I got $100,000. I don't need anybody. All the money in the world isn't gonna help you, Mitch. Everything you ever had, ever really wanted, is dead-- is buried in that cemetery up on the hill! Shut up. Killin' us isn't gonna change things, Mitch. Your wife is dead and she's not gonna come back, and you've got nothin'. Nothin'!I said, shut up! Let Dan go, Mitch. I'll stay with you here. Anywhere you ask. I'll be good to you, Mitch. I'll make you forget her. I swear to you, I'll make you forget her.You-- You cheap tramp, you. Make me forget Ellie? Oh, honey. Don't cry, honey. You didn't have any choice. You had no choice at all. So we figured by comin' here and tellin' you everything that happened, we'd run much less risk of a lynchin' party. We're not a lynching town, son. I can't tell you how... important this money is to the town. Difference between security and panic, I guess. You and Julie will be tried in court, fair and square-- if you're still here after I get back with Judge Swain. We'll be here. Could take three, four hours for me to find the judge. Couple of horses could be long gone by that time. No, Doc, we're through with runnin'. Could take two, three, maybe as much as five years out of your lives. We're expecting it. I've been, uh, braggin' for a long time about my town, my neighbors being kindly and understanding folks. I sure aim to prove it to you both. Dan. Tell me about Virginia again, Dan. What'll it be like? That's gonna take time, Julie. A lifetime. Not even Doc Seltzer can walk that slow.
