Go in the house. Bring them eggs with you. Miss Blodgett said you should fix the front step. Mm-hmm. How was your day? It was fine. How's your supper? It's good. "How was your day, Duncan?" Good. "Did you tell your father about old red hen?" "I had to bury another one" "of my chickens today, Edgar... old age." "Duncan played the minister. Should've seen him..." just don't. "Now, Edgar," "death's as much a part of life as living." Stop, stop it. Stop it! I'm going to have a smoke. That it? That's all of it. Look at that. Follows him like a little puppy dog. That chicken belongs with the others. Nacnud Egdum... that's my name backwards. Duncan Mudge is Nacnud Egdum. You go... M-U-D-G-E, E-G-D-U-M. Egdum. Egg dumb, huh? Yeah, it's kind of funny. You can do anything. Juster Pelkey is, uh... how about taking some chickens home? That would be great. Ok. Go grab him two good ones. They are not yours to give. You mind your manners and get the man his chickens. Hey... you hear me? I don't want to cause trouble... You ain't trouble. Sorry, Juster. That's ok, Duncan. How come Duncan don't help you? He helps out. Cousin Jessica, you're going to go live at Juster's house. It's ok, it's ok. Marilla the Gorilla is going with you. I know... I know. I'll miss you too.

You better get these home. Hey, girl. What the hell you doing? I was just petting her. She'll suck your dick if you let her. Well, I wouldn't let her. I'm just kidding you, Duncan. I know. Hey! She ain't gonna milk herself. No shit. Really? I'm just talking to my friend over here. You're a god damn smart ass, ain't you? What are you waiting for? Let's go. He's just mad 'cause he lost his license. Nice chicken. Do you want to hold her? No. I got to go in. Come on. Do you need any eggs? We're leaving shortly. I'm almost ready. on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame and I love that old cross where the dearest and best for a world of lost sinners was slain so, I?ll cherish the old rugged cross till the moment, at last I lay down I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown Where's my eggs, young man? Oh, I forgot. Um... I?ll bring them by after church. Duncan's it. I can't get over it. He's the spitting image of Lydia. You must see it, Edgar. Yeah, I see it. More and more like her every time I see him. Good morning. How are you? Tracey! Tracey! Where's your brother? We're leaving. Oh, he went off downstairs. I'll go get him. Thanks... come on, let's go.

He was just down there, um... by himself. Thanks, Duncan. Bye, Duncan. Edgar, glad you're here. 'Morning, reverend. How are you boys making out? Uh, we're fine, reverend. Doing just fine. What did I tell you about that chicken? Hey, chicken boy! Look, the egg lady. You're an asshole. "I'll have a dozen." "you're an asshole, Travis." We need more beer. All right, Travis, 'fess up. I told you, I?m broke till Monday, man. What, are you kidding me? Scotty, you never have money. When's the last time you bought the beer? Hmm, let me see, never. Fuck! Easy on my wheels, big fella. I'm trying. What should I do? Turn him upside down and shake him? I got money. How much? That'll do. I want some gum. Get some chips. I'm starving. Nice turd, Duncan. Hey, Travis, check out his turd! Oh, that's a nice one, pumpkin. Duncan, bring your chicken over here. Ha, ha, oh, my god. She is so cute. Can I hold her? Sure. Hey, who cuts your hair, Duncan? Your grandma, ha, ha... No. My dad. Right, ha... Ok. Aww, she's sweet. What's her name? Chicken. Me and my mom ordered a box of baby chicks in the mail and they were all supposed to be road island reds and girls, but... one of them turned out to be a rooster and one of them turned out to be white. Hmm. She was my mom's favorite. Your mom was so pretty. Yeah. Gross, Tonya. Shut up, April. Uh, chickens are filthy. God, you're such a girl. They have diseases. It's kind of... Eww... Put the tailgate up. Later, chicken boy. Why don't you come with us? Ok. Hold on. Duncan's coming with us. No way. Fuck you, Travis. He bought the beer. Brent... Help him with his bike. Jesus Christ. Give me the fucking bike. Come on. Let's go... What the fuck is that about? Whoo! Go, go, go, go, go... yaa! Oh... Ahh! Stop it! Hey, lay off the beer, ha... Scotty, you need a beer? You bought it. Whoo! Drink it up, brother. Hey, Duncan, How's the beer? Good. Hey, that hat is fucking cool, man. It was my mom's. Fuckin' geek. Look at him, look. Chicken boy! Oof! Fuck. Spell joke. J-O-K-E. Spell smoke. S-M-O-K-E. What's the white part of an egg? Weirdo. The yolk. Nope... albumen. The The white part... right. Ha, ha, come on. everybody knows wheelin' and dealin'... ... yes I do, I smell cowshit, how 'bout you? I smell cowplop, yes I do I smell cowplop, how 'bout you? I smell cowshit, yes I do I smell cowshit, how 'bout you? Scotty, let me sit up front... my hair's getting all tangled in my face. I smell cowplop, yes I do I smell cowplop, how 'bout you? Gimme that hat. Gimme it. Put this on. There you go. That better? Pff, get off me. What's the matter with you? You're a fuckin' bitch. Oh, my god. It's Perry... Perry smells like cowshit. You do smell like cowshit, man. Pff... Ow! Ass! Can we go get it? Brent! Let me out. I'm going home. What's the matter, Perry? Your vagina sore? Seriously, let me out of the fucking car. I'm leaving. All right. Take it easy. I want to go get it. Hey, Scotty, is there any more beer up there? Whoo! That's why they make fun of you, you know? That and the chicken. I want to go find it. Forget it. It's gone. How come you have to act like that in front of people? I don't know. My mom died. Yeah, I know. It's big, huh? Yeah. A lot of girls won't let me fuck them when they first see the size of it. You have to get them wet so you don't hurt them. Yeah. Yeah... You ever fuck a girl, Duncan? No. I did it with this girl once. She wouldn't let me put it in her. So I just kept rubbing down there, playing with her nipples. She had these big nipples, man. Stuck out like that. Ha, ha, big, hard ones. Big cow nipples. I'd rub one between my fingers and whisper "let me fuck you." No, I can't. So, I?d pinch them real hard when she said that. Hard, so she'd moan. Just to punish her a little. But you could tell she was loving it, 'cause her pussy was sopping wet. Ha, and I just kept licking on those nipples, flicking my tongue on them, pulling them. Just teasing the hell out of her. She started grabbing on that big dick. I was sliding two fingers in and out of her. "Let me fuck you." But she didn't say nothing. Just kept moaning and moving her ass. So I slide in another finger. Fuck me, fuck me. She said it that time. "Fuck me, Perry." I like to look them right in the eyes the first time they feel that dick going up in there. Pretty soon, I could feel her underneath me, sliding her ass down on that big dick. It's funny... first, they don't let you fuck them, then they're fucking themselves on your own cock. Yeah. People do weird stuff sometimes. Fuck! Perry! My dad. I better go before he comes out. Perry! Bye, Perry. Where you been? I was out riding around with my friends. I've been thinking that I want you to help me out more around here. There's no reason to pay Juster when I got a good, strong boy like you. How you feeling? Had supper? I'm fine. All right, well, we got to bale the rest of that first cut tomorrow. Yes, sir. Uh... I think your mother would want you to have this. Thank you. No more, all right. We got to get up at 5:00. Dad... you're not throwing it out, are you? I'm just putting some things in storage. We got to get an early start tomorrow. We got to get all this in the barn before it rains. Hey. No, thank you. Why don't you go get cleaned up? You can go see those friends of yours. What about dinner? I'll fix my own. Hey, Perry. What's up? They're cute, aren't they? Want some help? I got it. Why aren't you helping your dad? What did you do to your lip? Nothing. It's fucked-up, you know? You have this idea that your life will automatically be different when you grow up. Then you start getting older and you realize it's all going to be the same shit. You know what I mean? Sort of. It's a fucking joke. Yeah... I know what you mean. Ha... That chicken know any tricks? No. You should teach her some. Like what? I don't know. Roll over, sit... it's your chicken. Give me your bike. Take your clothes off. Aren't you going in? I'm waiting till I?m more sweaty. I'm going in. That's far. Is it deep? Deep enough. Hey, ahh! Are you crazy? You almost killed me! You're ok. You can swim, right? Yeah. Duncan! Ha, ha... oh, it's fucking cold! It's freezing. That was kind of fun. That wasn't so bad, was it? Whoo! It's neat. Yeah, it's my hideout. Really? Wow. Nobody but me. Did you ever bring a girl up here? Fuck, no. Duncan. Duncan! He's got to be here. His bike is here. Duncan buddy, ha. Where are you? Duncan? Come out, come out, wherever you are. Fudge boy! Dude, dude, put it on the tracks. No, no, wait. I got a better idea. Throw it in. My bike! I'll get it. Ha-ha... oops, sorry, man. Dinky, where are you? He's got to be below. Oh, shit! You're supposed to watch for trains. Fuck, I didn't hear it. Run, you stupid fucks! It's like a rock, huh? Yeah. I better get your bike. Me and my mom made a little cemetery for them when they get old. She won't let my dad eat them. She doesn't believe in it. And he listens to her? He used to. You guys gave them a lot of names. Yeah. I never knew anyone that died before. Are your grandparents still alive? My mom's are. I never met my dad's. They're probably dead. I always thought, if you're a good person, when you died, you'd just go straight to heaven. Like a reward or something. But then they just put you in the ground, and bugs and worms eat you. There's definitely a heaven. There has to be. Were they in love? Who? Your parents. Guess so. Want to know a secret? Yeah. Never mind. Tell me. I'm not going to tell anybody. You can calm a chicken by putting its head in your mouth. My mom showed me. Your mom was a weirdo, too, huh? No. I didn't mean that. You think I?m weird? Yeah. A little. Don't you? I don't know. Want to try it? See, that's what I?m talking about, Duncan. That's weird. Duncan! Coming. Is that it? That's it. Today was kind of fun. Hey, Mr. Mudge. Hey, Duncan. Hey, Duncan, you want to do something? We're just cruising around. Come with us, Duncan. Where's Perry? We're going to pick him up. Can I? Yeah. Go ahead. Let me get ready. How you been, Mr. Mudge? Just fine. Good. Good to hear. Duncan! Bye, dad. Ok. Hey, you got money, right? Hold on a minute. Buy something for your friends there. Wow, thank you. Scotty, get the fuck out. Please. Yeah, right. Hop in, buddy. Hey, Duncan, where's your chicken. I don't know. Bummer. She's probably around somewhere. Bye, dad. Careful, now. come on, get up hey, hey come on, get up hey, hey, hey, hey come on, get up hey, hey Take a pull, Duncan. Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink... drink, drink, drink, drink, drink... Pumpkin! Dandelion wine. How you feel, buddy? How you feeling? How you feeling? Tingly. Tingly, huh? Hey, Duncan. Do her again, man. Yeah, do it. Come on. Naw, I shouldn't have done it. Come on, do it. Do it... do it. Come on, man, do it. Took an awful spill off my bike today. I need you to fix those tires, Edgar. They're awful wobbly. Hey. Hello. Who is that guy? Leave him alone. He's a freak. Freak! Hold on... To Duncan. To drunken Mudge. To the chicken boy. Chicken boy! Chicken boy, ha-ha. Hey. Uh-uh. Come on. To the chicken boy. Chicken boy! Moo. Fuck off. Ahh! Oh, jeez. Perry, stop it. Shit! Hurry, do something. That's enough! Don't talk like that to a lady, you fucking faggot. Perry. Perry! You fucking kicked his ass. You beat the shit out of him. Motherfucker! Teach that boy some manners. You see that, Scotty? Fuck, yeah, I saw it. You're insane, Peraldo. I'm cold. Brent, take me home. It's time to hook up or pass out. Guess which one you're doing. Come on, Brent. I'm getting all bitten up. You're going to have to wait till I sober up. I already fucked up one truck like that. Are you kidding me? Perry, make him take me home. I'm freezing. Perry, I?m talking to you. Come here, baby. I'll warm you up. Get over here. April! Get off of me. You like that? What's the matter with you? You're taking forever. Nothing. Keep doing it. April? Let's go. - We're leaving. - I got to go. - You're kidding me. - No. Sorry. April, come on. I got us a ride. You're a fucking bitch. Fuck you. Ha, pervert. Fucking tease. You're in the shithouse with me, man. No, no, I?m sorry, Perry. I didn't, I didn't mean to. Forget it. I'm, I?m sorry, Perry. I know something we could do. Hurry the fuck... Duncan was watching. Shut up. I'm tired. They're going to fucking leave. My dad put all her stuff out here. Why? He wants to forget her, I guess. She sure had a lot of shit. Yeah. Hey, thanks, Perry. For what? Being nice. My knuckle is bleeding. You see me hit that guy? The fucker cut me. Here, fix your hairdo. Pew, oh, it stinks. My mom could play that. Yee-haw! Shh! My dad. Ha-ha, oh, oops. Check this out. Try it on. Mm-mm. What else is there? Come on. It's funny. Uh, I?m not supposed to. Just try it on. All right, let's get out of here if you don't want to have any fun. Well, you don't think it's weird? Uh-uh. It's just the two of us. Who cares? You really want me to? I don't want you to. I just thought it would be funny. Like hallowe'en or something. Me and my mom used to go trick-or-treating. This old lady, miss McGee, who lived up the road from us... Not over your clothes. It won't look right. And, uh, ha... well, everyone used to think she was a witch, 'cause her house, it did look kind of haunted. But, um... so, one year we go up there, and we go on her porch, and she just comes running out of there waving her broomstick at us and yelling and saying that, if we didn't get out, she'd call the constable. Turn around. Looks good. Ha... yeah. Mm... don't take it off. You got to do the back up. It was weird, 'cause she really did look like a witch, but... we just felt kind of bad for her, though. Even though she didn't give us any candy. I remember that old lady. She was a fucking bitch. You sure swear a lot, Perry. What? Bitch? Perry. Ha-ha, are you a bitch? No. Quit it. Bitch. Ha-ha-ha. Huh? Quit it, Perry. Huh? Say it. Say it. I'm a bitch. Take it out. Take it out! Go on. Tastes like pee. Keep doing it. Ow! Fuck, that hurt. Perry. What the fuck is the matter with you? I'm sorry. Would you stop fucking saying that? All right? I'm not mad at you. What are you doing? What are you doing? Perry, what are you doing? Shh. Perry? Hold still. I'm not going to hurt you. All right? Perry. Spread your legs. Further. That's it. Shh. I'm just going to put it in a little. Perry... ah, ah. That's not so bad, right? You ok? God, you're fucking tight. It feels just like a pussy. Ahh! Ah, ahh! Ah... ah, ahh... ahhh. My dad says we might be getting a new car. It's about time. You seen our old one? My mom can hardly drive it 'cause the steering wheel shakes so bad. You hear it coming from a mile away 'cause the muffler fell off. It's fucking embarrassing. Don't tell my dad, ok? That's why she drives the truck. Can you undo it? I was trying to take it off. I couldn't get it off. You go on home, Perry. Go in the house. And take that thing off. I can't... I said, take it off! I can't undo it. I'm sorry. Don't talk to me. Get up. I'm up. Hey! Wash up before you sit down. You hear me? Get up. Move it. Not so easy, is it? Hmm? I do it every goddamn day. You're weak. How you ever going to take care of yourself, huh? Hmm? Get up. Goddamn it, Duncan, get your filthy ass off your mother's sofa... now! In case you haven't noticed, she's dead. What's the matter with you? Huh? What's the matter with you? You can't even get into trouble like a normal boy. All right. Goddamn, all right. All right. Dad, you can't. Dad, you can't. You can't. Go... go on! Put them down. Do it. Please? Put it down. Please, dad. I should have done this from the start. Perry. Perry? What the fuck are you doing? I need to talk to you. Jesus, Duncan. You smell like shit. What did your dad say? Nothing. Nothing? He burned all my mom's stuff. He didn't say anything about me? No. You sure? He's only mad at me. I didn't tell him what you did. We can't do nothing no more. It ain't right. I didn't tell him, Perry. We can't do nothing no more. It's queer. I ain't no queer. I know. I'm sorry, Perry. You're always sorry. What are you sorry about? You act like a goddamn girl sometimes, Duncan. Shit. Perry. What? Did you ever... Did you ever think about kissing me? You're crazy, Duncan. No. No way. Is that what you want? Huh? No. You're a fucking faggot, Duncan. Stay the fuck away from me. Where the hell you been, Perry? Just out smoking. Just out smoking, huh? Yeah. What does "lights out" mean, Perry? I know I, I know I... I know I?ve said it, but I just... just can't seem to remember. Out wandering around time? Out raising hell time? Just out smoking time? Bedtime. Look at that. Yeah, guess that's it. Bedtime. Jump. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Thank you. One dollar. Oh, I thought they were 75. One dollar. Thank you. Chicken? Chick, chick? What are you doing? Hey, chicken boy. I like your chicken. Don't you guys like his chicken? Hell, yeah. Let me see her? Sure, Duncan, buddy. I'm just kidding. Let me see her. Give her to me, Travis. You want her? Ha-ha-ha. Are we hanging out tonight, Duncan? It ain't a party without you. Please? Hey, Scotty, let me see her? How you doing? It's good to see you. Scotty, give her to me. Scotty, please. Something is wrong with her, Duncan. Scotty, please. She don't look too good. Is she sick, Scotty? I think she might be. Aw, chicken boy lost his chick. Take her, Perry. You want her? Trav... what the fuck you looking at? Perry, what happened? What are you, a moron? What do you think happened? Happy now? Perry, put your shirt down, man. Faggot. I'm not a faggot. Oh, ha, the truth hurts, doesn't it, ass humper? I'm not! Scotty, Scotty... Scotty, no. Scotty. Scotty? Scotty, don't. What's wrong, chicken? We're just fucking with you. Oh, Perry. Break its neck. Kill it, fucking kill it. Kill it. Perry... Perry... Perry, no. Let him go. What the fuck are you talking about, man? What? Let him go. Brent, what the fuck, Brent? Whoa. What the fuck are you doing, Perry? You ain't no fucking fun any more, Peraldo. Yeah, dude, you're such a wet noodle or wet blanket or whatever. Wet something, man. Wet something. Let's get out of here. I'm not a faggot, Perry. Why don't you show us how you suck it, fudge boy? Woo, yeah! Why don't you suck it like your mother showed you? Excuse me, Mrs. Mudge, can you teach me how to suck a dick? Oh, shit, he did it. Ha-ha-ha. Motherfuck, tastes like chicken. Oh, fuck. You weren't kidding, Perry. Hey, Duncan, what are you doing later? You got any plans? Faggot. Oh, shit, man. Shit. Oh, god. Fucking a, ha-ha-ha. Oh, Jesus Christ. You are cold-blooded, chicken boy. What did you go and do? Huh? What happened? What happened? I got to go deal with it. Let me go. Let me go. No. Let me go. Let me go! No. Let me go. Shh, shh. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Shh, no. Shh, shh, shh.
