She should be here by now. Her parents must want her to look her best. They're keen for their daughter to marry the Kazusaya heir, so it requires effort. The girl is reputed to be a real beauty. That's right. What can be the delay? She's here! Young master. That's Mr. Oumi's daughter. Miss. The young master of the Kazusaya family is over there. She's the Goddess Saraswati incarnate. She'll make a beautiful bride! He doesn't look all that smart. In fact he looks stupid. Watch it! Mother, she's gorgeous. You like her? - Take care of it, will you? - Yes, ma'am. Look, Mother. The festivities are under way! Here comes the parade. Miss, would you like to see the parade? They're energetic! Thanks for coming. The young master's taken with you. I'll take you to him. Miss, we should accept his kind offer. We've got the sucker hooked. Stop, porter. Hey! You can come out now. - Is it safe? - Yes. Oh, this kimono is so uncomfortable! I feel stiff all over. Hey, dummy! Hand over my sandals. Come on, move it! It's good to stretch. Everything went as planned, thanks to you. Show me your appreciation. In shiny gold, like you promised. There's no rush. Shohei and I always keep our word. - Hand it over! - Relax. Have this, Okichi. You've earned it. Don't expect any thanks. I'll just count it. Shohei, Senta! You said I'd make a fortune... It's only 5 ryo! I'm sorry but that's all we have. That's bull. I was central in your scheme to con the Kazusaya family. Even if another bride takes my place I'm the imposter who lured him into it. If I'm found, they'll have me beheaded. 5 ryo won't make up for the risk I took! You think it's not enough? Come on, where's your heart? We conned a powerful and rich merchant family! I deserve 30 but I'll give you a discount. How about 20? Now! 20! You think I have that much on me? Well, I don't! You cheap liar. Judging by that fat purse of yours, I'd say you have 50. 20 out of 50 is nothing. Hand it over now! I need it to help my only brother. Cut the bull and pay up! Bastards! Darn! I won't let you have it. Watch it! Bastards! I'll tell Kazusaya about your scam! No, you won't. It's the police! Yamakichi Inn Okichi... It's time I left. Oh, Brother! Don't go yet! Do you really have to go? Yes. Our father left this inn to me. For me to carry on his legacy. I felt indebted to our parents. But you know how things soured. I did my best to keep the inn running. But the economy is bad. Father left me this place... So I didn't want to take out a mortgage on it. I tried everything to save it but... business at the inn was slow. I wasn't capable of reviving it. I was broke and I suppose I became desperate. Now I have nowhere to go because I'm a fugitive from the law. Not only am I a felon. I involved you in those honey trap schemes. You never wanted to do it but you did it for me. Okichi, I'm so sorry. Wait, Brother! You are right. I did it for you. I pose as a rich girl and get called Dame. Today I conned an honest family out of 20 ryo. Brother. I'm tired of trickery and deceit. Please put crime behind you. Please live your life honestly. Sorry, Okichi.. We only live once. We better do it right. Brother, let's redeem ourselves. And live with dignity. I'll be away 3 years... maybe 5. When my crimes have been forgotten I'll be back. Okichi... Until then, so long. I'll leave the inn and the family shrine to you. Make sure you take good care of them. Okay, Okichi? I'll use the money to get out of Edo. Okichi, take care of yourself. You too, dear brother. I saw you in action by the creek. It wasn't much to see. Your brother, Nisaburo, is wanted for a murder. And you let him escape! He's my brother, my flesh and blood. Let him be, Deputy. I'll do you a favor if you do me one. Will it be money or...? Which will it be? Show us the bride! Hey, keep it down! I heard she's very lovely. Is she really? I want to see her! It'll be your turn next year! Don't tease me! Ladies, is there a wedding on? How nice! The performance is over. Prepare the banquet. Girls, let's get going! Get the sake ready. Put that there. - Can the food be served? - Yes! Thank you. Are we ready? The vows are over so please remove the veil. Dad, it's the wrong bride! This isn't the young lady we met! The wrong bride! They don't even look alike! What's going on? We were conned. It was a ruse! - We were conned? - We were! Shh! We don't want this to get out. Everybody, be quiet. We were conned. - What? - Chief. That's bull! It makes no sense but it's true. Come on. She is the daughter of a samurai! How dare you say that she's the wrong bride! You dishonor my family! You leave me no option but to kill the Kazusaya family right here! All of you! As a samurai I'm honor-bound to kill my daughter myself. We've been humiliated by merchants! My lord, please pull yourself together! It's just a bluff! Chief, calm down. We don't want any more embarrassment. Back off, Master. We've done nothing wrong. Give this to him. - Lord! - I'll kill them! - Take this and leave. - Listen to him. - You fraud! - Chief, stop! This should settle it. - Bishop, come and get your share. - Great! I hope it's a lot. I want it so bad, I could grow another hand! What's the rush? Don't worry, I'll be fair. We only get 10 ryo each? Hey, Shohei! Senta! You lured them in with Dame Okichi and you got our stellar performances all for 10 ryo? You can do better than that. Give us a break. If we'd stayed around we could have got 20 more. But we didn't want to blow our covers. Lucky none of us got arrested. Right? 10 is good. That's bull. As usual. Don't say that! It's just for now. Okay? Rich men like Kazusaya have pride. We'll go back for more. Monk and Bishop, listen to him. Senta makes sense. We'll blackmail them. We have ourselves a money tree. A tree...? Speaking of trees, the lumberyard owner's son wants a wife. You mean, Kadomasa? Now that's a rich family. I think the son's name is Hanjiro. We hook him with Okichi. Monk is the bride and Bishop is the maid. A little change in the cast. But Okichi's trying to distance herself from us. I guess she won't be part of it. You think so? Leave it to me, I'll persuade her. That's the way! Go for it. She'll listen to you. The Kadomasa family is loaded, too! We'll squeeze lots of money out of them. 10 is not enough. Right, Bishop? Right. Hey, Okichi. I'm not a fool. You promised me a lump payment of 15 ryo if I let you off. Remember that? Give me more time. It's not much to ask. I can't. I won't wait. I've heard that one already. You helped a wanted murderer escape. Then there are your own crimes. Come on. Get up, I'm taking you in. - Let go! - Come on. - Damn you! - Just come. Come on, Okichi. The promised 15 ryo. Now I've paid you, you can't arrest her. What's that? Deputy, I know your plan. Take that money for now. Maybe next time... you can seduce her. Does that mean I have to be part of your plot? Is that why you bribed the deputy? That's right. Listen, Okichi. The Kadomasa family owns a lumberyard. It's a huge business! I know I owe you. But I'm done with scams. Don't say that! his will be your last one. Come on, Okichi, please. Come on, do it for me. Do your best to trick the son. He'll make us rich! Be quiet. - Thank you for that. - It's nothing. Sei, got a minute? What is it, ma'am? I have something to ask. I wonder if you'd do me a big favor. - Would you? - Of course. Where's the young master? Maybe he's at the dock. Young master, a visitor came to the shop looking for you. Who is it? A stranger. Ma'am. It's the young master. Young master. Do you recognize me? You're my fiancee, Mr. Nagato's daughter! Miss Ohana. That's not who I really am. It's a fake name designed to deceive you. I'm part of a scheme to blackmail your family for money. Oh, Heavens! Send someone to cancel the engagement immediately. Or the blackmailers will give your family trouble. Wait just a second! Please wait! Wait! Who are you? Can you tell me your name? What's your name? I've thought of you every minute since we met. I look forward to our wedding so much I dream of you each night. No matter who you say you are, I can't give you up. Please tell me your name. Young master, you've been thinking of me... I only want to marry you. It'd be best for both of us if I told you nothing and we part ways. We shouldn't meet again. Let me go! I appreciate how you feel about me. But I pretended to be the daughter of a noble family. I trick men into engagement to extort money from them. I'm Dame Okichi, the outlaw. I've heard about Dame Okichi. It's you! That should wake you from 100 years of romance. If my parents were alive and my brother was reliable I wouldn't be a con artist. Whatever anybody says about you, I won't give up. Damn you! Hey, Okichi. You double-crossed us! This is the end, you two! Watch out! Young master. Okichi. I tried to persuade him but the young master won't come home. So our son is with the woman named Okichi? The two are living at an inn like a couple. The woman he's with is a fraudster known as Dame Okichi. The whole thing must be her scheme. What should we do? Can't we pay her off and tell her to stay away? I suggested that but he's under her control. Say no more! As of this moment Hanjiro is no longer our son. I disown him forever. To meet is when parting begins That's how the world goes I tell myself so Upon returning home Life tends to get cloudy As if it were the sky And it clouds over the Moon Would you come out If I begged you to? Hey. Your overseer has come here on a few occasions asking you to go home. You really should go home. To meet is when parting begins. You're the Kadomasa's only son. I have no family of my own. I'm nobody. My life has been harsh. Our life together will never work out. Enough of that. Because I lost all my family I can imagine how your parents are feeling. You're the heir to a successful family business. It must break your father's heart that I'm keeping you in this shabby inn. Go home for his sake. I won't leave you to go home. Just think of this as a dream and give it up. You can afford to marry a girl from a good family. Look around at the world. Open your heart to its possibilities. Be the great man you deserve to be. Please go home to your parents. Nothing could make me go. You mean that you'll stay with me for the rest of your life? You mean it? Yes, I promise. Sei, it's time to go. I've eaten, drunk sake and heard her play. It's closing time. It's time for me to go back to my love. You boasting again? - Say hello to Okichi. - Say it yourself. You're tough! I'm gone. Nisaburo! You can't run! I can't... I can't cause more trouble for Okichi. If he wasn't here Okichi would be all mine. Let's not argue. I'll sing. Damn it. Okichi. You're hiding your brother. What's he done this time? Don't play dumb. These eyes of mine can see through everything. Give him to me or else...! My brother hasn't come here! Liar! Nobody's visited me. Shut up. So you won't tell me where he is. Then you're coming with me to the jail. She won't! - Young master! - Get off me! No, don't! This has happened because I'm a sinful woman. I hope you can forgive me. It looks like there's no end to my misery. Hide! Before we leave Edo for good, you should see your parents. Thank you. Kadomasa Lumber It's cloudy now. I guess it'll rain. Kinsuke! Young master! I'm glad you are back! Master really misses you! Follow me inside. Come to my shack. Sorry it's so grimy. Make yourself at home. Kinsuke. Listen. I have to pack for a long absence. Sir? I'm in a hurry. Can you arrange for me to see my parents? Even from afar? I will, sir. Once we leave Edo, it isn't certain when we can return. So spend some time with your parents before we go. - Hanjiro! - Mother! I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've put you through. You have your home right here. Why would you want to leave Edo? Hanjiro. Why don't we put this all behind us so you can come back and take over the business? Your father is getting old. He talks about you every day and he cries every day. I'm sorry, Mother. Your son can no longer return here to live. Have you done something wrong? Yes, Father... Young master, hold on! I'm the one who's been keeping him from you. If anybody should be blamed it's me, Okichi. I hope you understand. I'll go to jail for you. For me? We met because I pretended to be someone. Destiny brought us together in irregular circumstances. For a short time you gave me a normal and fulfilling life. It's my trade to pretend to be someone. I'll pretend that I killed the officer and go to jail for the crime. And you... Take care of your parents. They're getting old. I hope you understand. Hanjiro, don't go. Okichi. Hanjiro, stop. Okichi. The End
