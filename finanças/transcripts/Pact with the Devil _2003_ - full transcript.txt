[plastic rustling] Mr. Wooten, Mr. Wooten? Are you all right? [officers chattering] - Yes, I think so. - Why don't we talk over here. [chattering over police radio] [grunting] So you knew both the victims? - Yes, yes. Actually, I was there when they first met, oh, must be 20 years ago now. [upbeat electronic music] I was managing Bae Connelly at the time. I discovered Bae in Berlin, she had a marvelous eye. So I brought her back to New York and under my guidance. - Hey, how ya doing? - [Henry] She quickly became the top fashion photographer of the time. - See you later. - [Henry] Everyone wanted Bae's photographs. - Oh, please give him that. - [Henry] I'd convinced her to shoot the first Sauvage campaign. - Oh Christine, forget about your hair. Please go out for the rare one, yes, thank you. - Hey, yeah! Henry! - Christine, hey! - Hey! - Mm, wow, you've gone all native. Oh listen here, a souvenir from last night. - Oh my. [laughs] [people chattering] - [Henry] Remember Sauvage, the scent that drives your lover wild. Oh, they haven't sold it now for what, 10 years. Made a big splash back then. My old pal, Nino Barrachi's first hit fragrance. [laughs] - Check the flood lighting again, please Vince. - Hello, beautiful. - Woo! [laughs] - [Man] That's not bad, that's not bad. - What the hell are you doing here? - I thought I'd give you a little moral support. - [Man] Okay, Tony? - I think it's you who need the moral support, my dear. [laughs] - [grunts] God, what the hell is this crap! I asked for Pellegrino, Jesus! - That bitch, Christine cut it out, let's get going here! Louis, go and get her the Pellegrino. Please! - Okay. - Okay, positions everybody, let's get moving. Hit those drums. [upbeat drum music] Oh, here we go everybody. [camera clicking] Come on, loosen up a little bit. [camera clicking] Please some more, that's better, now get into it. Listen, I want you to be wild. Come on, think Sauvage, give to that to me. Yes, and more. Perfect, you look beautiful. Okay now all together, yeah, come on, be wild! Yes, once more! [camera clicking] Simmer everybody, loosen up please. Come on, I said loosen up a little bit more. Yes, okay, let's try it together again. Oh, come on you can loosen more. Yes, please don't smile, I don't want you smiling, okay? So, please, yeah, that's great. Now think Sauvage, do that, will you. That's right. Perfect, that's beautiful. Okay, now together, yeah. [camera clicking] [people gasping] [camera clicking] - I knew in that first moment, he was something special. As you can see, he had quite a look. [officers chattering] [stretcher rattling] - Go on, Mr. Wooten. - Well, after Nino's shoot had finished, I went over to Dorian and introduced myself. Good shoot Bae, good shoot, I'll see you tomorrow. We'll get the contacts, mm? - Bye. [people chattering] - Louis, right? How do you do? Henry. - Hi, nice camera. - Oh yes, old faithful, be my guest. - Thanks. - Have you been working for Bae long? - Oh, just today, they needed an extra gofer. Low guy on the totem pole. Is Bae a friend of yours? - Old friend and client. Actually, I'm her manager. So, you like photography do you? - Oh kind of, I'm more into the street stuff, mostly people. - Ah, well are you showing in any galleries? I'd love to come down and take a look. - Well, I've been in a couple of group shows, that's about it, for now. - For now? - Well, I've got plans. [laughing] - Excellent, a young man with plans. [chuckles] I've always maintained that one's aim in life should be self-development. Realizing one's potential to the maximum. I mean, that's what we're here for, right Louis? - Yeah, yeah I guess so. - Then, why is it, Louis, that nowadays, young people are afraid to show their feelings? And why do they forget to live life to its fullest and have no fear? - Well, I don't know if I could really answer-- - Pay no attention to him, Louis. Henry's always going on about something or another. [laughing] - Thanks for the gig, Bae. - Welcome. - Good to meet you, Henry. - Yes. - Oh. Oh, thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - Louis, you ought to try getting in front of the camera. - [laughs] Right. [camera clicks] [intense rock music] I learned from Bae that Louis and his girlfriend Sybil were considering marriage, an institution I'm not a champion of. Marriage makes one unselfish and unselfish people are colorless. They lack individuality and above all, they aren't egotistical. The quality that I have every intention of nurturing in Louis. - [James] Sybil, Sybil, how are you? Hey, I'm sorry I missed you. - So long, hey. - Listen. - James, I've gotta go. - Grab some cash. - Can I help you, please. - [James] Sybil, come on! - No, no I can't. - Hey hey! - Just lend me ten bucks. - You gotta go. - Be back! - [Louis] Hey, get out of the purse! - [James] Come on! - [Sybil] I can't! - Look Sybil, hey. - [Sybil] Louis. - [James] You've been there, help them! - Look, here this is all I got. - Louis, come on. - I'm sorry. - 25 cents! What am I supposed to do with 25 cents? [upbeat music] [coin clinking] - Shut up, garbage! You stink! ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ [camera clicking] ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ ♪ Yes, too much, too much, too much confusion ♪ - [Henry] I showed Nino Barrachi the photo of Louis that I had taken at Bae's shoot. Nino agreed with me, Louis was the face of tomorrow and the perfect image for his Sauvage fragrance. - Go on. - Then, with a little persuasion made to Bae, and a lot of flattery directed towards Louis, I was able to get them to give it a whirl. - Come one Louis, yes. Once more and come on, once more. [camera clicking] Yes, yes, go on like that. Just a second, great. Okay. Yes, okay once more. [camera clicking dramatically] Okay and. [camera clicking dramatically] Come on, let's try to have some fun. [camera clicking dramatically] Yes, that's it. [camera clicking dramatically] That's great. Oh! - Ow. - [Bae] Are you okay? - Yes, yes. - Just a second. Listen, your tomorrow kid needs to relax and get natural. - Being natural is just a pose Bae, and the most irritating one I know. Louis, just take a break. - Yeah. - [Henry] Good work. Here, wet your whistle with this. - I don't know, man. - Go on, just knock it back. - [sighs] I can't relax, I-- - It's all right, don't worry. You'll get into it. - I think maybe you'd be better off. - Ah ah ah, please Louis, do not think. Intellect destroys the harmony of any face. Beauty is a form of genius Louis, it needs no explanation. It's one of the great facts of this world like sunlight or springtime or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. Beauty cannot be questioned. It has the divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who possess it. [dramatic music] You wanna be a photographer right? - Right. - Well this is what you do. First, we establish you as a world class supermodel. Well then you could do whatever the hell you want. If it's photography, fine. Of course, it's up to you Louis. You have to take that first step. - Supermodel. Okay, oh. Okay. - Fine, fine, Bae! Back to work. [upbeat pop music] - [Bae] Yes, here we go. - Yes. - [Henry] In front of the camera, he was a natural. He was born to be looked at. - [Bae] That's it! - [Henry] He loved to be photographed, to be watched. It made him feel alive. - [Bae] Beautiful. ♪ Turned on by life, ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Shining my light - [Bae] Okay, now you're into it, that's great. ♪ Melting into the desire - [Bae] Okay, that one looks great. ♪ Taking me higher, fight ♪ Ride ♪ Teases me - Yes! ♪ Ride ♪ Pleases me ♪ Fight, ride - [Bae] You're great, man. ♪ Tease me - Whew! - Yeah? - [Bae] That was great. - All right! - That was great, I'm just gonna pick a light. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ Ooh ooh [camera clicking] ♪ Teases me - I got Bae to blow up the shot I'd taken of Louis and then invited him over to my place for drinks. [laughing] Yeah, oh, I could come by this afternoon, five o'clock? Yeah, good! Yes, yes, yes. Well I told you he really is the face of tomorrow. And you got him first, Nino. Well, just have the papers ready. Certified check, yeah. [chuckles] Thanks Nino. Okay, [laughs] ciao. [phone beeps] Congratulations Louis, you're now officially the new face of Sauvage. [laughs] - You're kidding me. - Well done. [laughing] Nino sends his congratulations, too. He thinks this is some of the best work that Bae's ever done. I must say, I tend to agree with him. She's really captured something. - What's wrong? - Nothing, hm. Age, makes me rather sad. - Why, is it all that terrible? - Hm, by 50 every man has the face he deserves. How's that for terrifying? [laughing] You know, I think that Bae must be some kind of sadist at heart. Oh you wait, when you get old, wrinkled, and gray you'll curse her every time you look at this face. - Henry, are you tripping out on me? - [chuckles] Come on, let's have a drink to celebrate. - Of course you could always turn the tables around like Dorian Gray. - [Louis] Like who? - The hero of a brilliant Oscar Wilde novel. Champagne? - Yeah. - Yes, Dorian was so handsome. Huh, glasses. He was so handsome that an artist painted his portrait. So Dorian made a wish. [cork popping] Ah, whoa, whew! [laughing] He makes a wish that the portrait grows old while he stays young forever. [gentle classical piano music] - Oh, like a pact with the devil. - [laughing] Yeah, kind of. - So what, it works, Dorian never gets any older? - Yes, but it doesn't have a happy ending. - It sounds great to me. - Well, you like the idea, do you? - Wait a minute. If this picture changed instead of me, yeah, I could deal with that. - [laughs] Well then, I guess that makes you the perfect candidate to be the new Dorian, what do you think? - What do I think about what? - Your new professional name, Dorian. - Dorian? A little pretentious. Dorian, but I kinda like it. - I thought you would, hmm, well. Here's to you Dorian, a star is born. [glasses clinking] [wind roaring] [dramatic, eerie music] [rain splattering] [lock clicking] [steps tapping] [somber orchestral music] [bottles clinking] - [Henry] Age makes me rather sad. By 50, every man has a face that he deserves. How's that for terrifying [laughs]. You know, I think Bae must be a kind of sadist at heart. Now you wait, when you get old, wrinkled, and gray. You'll curse her every time you look at this face. [grunting] [bottle cap clinking] [tense music] Dorian made a wish, that the portrait grows old while he stays young forever, forever, forever. - [Louis] Like a pact with the devil. - [Henry] Yes. But it doesn't have a happy ending. - Sounds great to me. [dramatic music] It's a deal. [thunder roaring] - A bargain then. A bargain then. - Forever. - Forever. [eerie droning] ♪ Come on [upbeat dance music] [crowd yelling] - Dancing with Mr. D, huh? - [Woman] Hey there's Dorian. - [Woman] Oh, he so hot! [laughing] - [Louis] So what do you think of all this? - Decadence fascinates me. [chuckles] [spray bottle hissing] - Yeah? What about art? - Art? Art is a sickness. - And love? - Love? - Yeah, what about love? - Love is an illusion. [woman laughing] - Wait a minute, then what do you believe in, Henry? Cheers. - Let me refill your glass. - [Sybil] Louis! - Champagne, please. - Hey, where's Sybil. - She was around here somewhere. - Louis! - [Trina] Henry. - Oh, hello Trina, how are you, darling? Good to see you. - [Sybil] Louis! - [Man] Hey. - [Sybil] Louis! - You gonna introduce me? Hi, I'm Trina Rousch. - Hi. - Are you as good as you look? - I think so. [laughing] - Louis! Dorian! [laughing] - I like a man with a future, but not a woman with a past. Trina baby, you're hogging our star. - Okay, you want 10% of this action too, Henry? - Oh, what did the poet say? Shove it where the sun don't shine. - Henry [laughs]. - Ugh, Dorian! - Where'd you say you saw her? - Um... Here, there she is. - Syb! Sybil, what's wrong? - [Sybil] I have to get out of here. - What are you talking about? Look we're going places together. - No, we're not. - Listen, look, the doors are open, we're in, we are on our way. No more hassles, no more struggles, the world is ours. - No Louis, the world is yours. - [Louis] Look, nothing can stop us now. - I can't-- - No stop, listen to me, I love you. Okay? [sighing] - I love you, too. - Let's get out of here okay? - [Sibyl] Okay. [crowd shouting] - So I was thinking of taking Syb away for awhile. - Now wait a minute, we just got some momentum here. The Sauvage campaign is just the beginning for you. - I know but this modeling thing, it isn't for me, I want to take pictures. - Wait a minute, we had an agreement. This is just the first step Dorian. - It's not just that, it's Syb. She doesn't like what's happening. - Hmm, hmm. - She's afraid of losing me. - Yeah, well you remember last night every woman in that disco wanted you. - Yeah, I felt like a piece of meat. - Now wait a minute, you just listen to me. You stop thinking like that right now. The gods have been so kind to you. For what they gave, they can soon taketh away. Don't squander the gold of your days. For a season, the world belongs to you. - [sighs] I don't know what I wanna do. - That's why you've got a manager. [key jingling] - What is this for? - Oh, that looks like the key to your new loft. - [Man] Yeah, can I get the door for you? - Say goodbye to Brooklyn, say hello to Manhattan. Top floorm and you're very lucky you bought it cheap. Friends of mine are renovating the building. [laughing] - Looks like a great place. - Ah. Think Syb will like it? - Yeah, yeah, of course she will. - Open the door [laughs]. - Well at least check it out. - [Sibyl] I just don't want to move right now. - What, you like this junkie infested pit better? - What's that supposed to mean? You think I'm back on the needle again? - Look, maybe I oughtta just get outta your hair for awhile. - And go where? - Henry's, he's having a few people over for dinner tonight. - Louis, it's after midnight. - So what? Come with me Syb. - Come as what? As Dorian's girl? Another joke for Henry's snob friends to laugh at? - Hey they're my friends, too, you know? - Friends, Louis, they drool over you like some pinup boy. God, is that all you want to be, some mindless model toy? - All right, right, I'm not a real artist. Not like you and your performance theater, right? - You're pathetic, go on, forget your photography, forget your dreams, just throw it all away and go uptown to your jerk-off party. You know what? That's where you belong, up with Henry and all of his sell-out phonies. Louis, if you really think that this modeling crap is gonna be some short cut to success as a photographer, then you are a fool! - Shut up! [Sibyl screaming] Shut up! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Baby, come on you know. - No! [photograph clattering] Get out! - Baby, please you know I wouldn't-- - Get out! [gasping] [door thudding] [gasping] Oh, Louis.

You know, top model's real life, the naked truth behind the glamor, that sort of bull, ha. I think she'll go along with it under one condition. She wants Bae to do the photographs so if we can sign Bae on, we've got ourselves a six figure deal. - So what's the title of the book? - Hold on, Dorian, A Model Life. - Diana thinks it's going to be huge. Especially if you do the photographs. - Me? What? - No, no, no, I want you Bae. You're the best. - Your tastes, your aesthetic. - Come on, I really wanna work with you again. What do you say? - All the artistic decisions will be yours. And Dorian's of course. No interference from anyone. - Please. [gentle, soulful music] - Okay. - There you go, there you go, come here. We're gonna have a great time. [gentle, soulful music] - [Henry] Dorian and Bae got to work together again. It was heaven for them. [camera clicks] Somehow, Bae was able to help Dorian temper his ways and bring out the Louis that was buried deep inside him. - [Bae] What do you really want Dorian? - [Louis] To finish this book, mm-hm. - [Bae] And then? - Sell a billion copies, get rich and famous. License my name out to sheets, towels, underwear. Retire to a life with pure access. - That's what Henry wants. I thought you wanted to take pictures? - I do. - [Bae] So what changed? - Nothing, I'm still going to but not until the time's right. - When would that be? - I'm not sure, Henry-- - [clicks tongue] Henry. - How long have you known Henry for? - Hm, for an eternity. I was one of his first clients. - [Louis] Really? Has he had many clients? - Only a very select few. - I guess that makes me one of the lucky few, right? - Guess so. - Henry says you're a hermit. And me I've got to stay out there and make the scene be visible. - Sure thing. - Look, we're a team. [pinball table ringing] I'm happy right now having fun. Good times, excitement. - Dorian. - That's what I like, Bae, it's what comes easy for me. Walk into a room, and I can feel people's eyes all over me. It's what Henry says the world's all about. - Be careful. - I thought you liked Henry. - I do. - I do but what? - [Bae] I don't like what he does to you. What he wants you to be. You're better than that, Dorian. - Henry's all right, he only offers me choices. I'm the one that makes the decisions. - Are you sure of that? - Yeah, of course I am. - He works for me.

Nobody's ever captured you like that. It's like you two were meant for each other. [gentle piano music] - Excuse me. - I'm sorry, I didn't realize you two were an item. - Fling. [laughing] Henry! - Dorian, Trina. May I introduce you to Mariella Steiner, she's married to one of my oldest friends, Rolf. - Oh good for you, honey, one of the richest men in Europe, very impressive. [clears throat] - Dorian, Henry told me this would be the book launching of the season. - Well, we certainly hope so, Enchante. - It's quite the book. - Oh, you've read it? - No, I looked at the pictures. [laughing] - Oh, you must meet the photographer. - Yes, unfortunately our dear Bae had to leave. - Well, I think it's going to be a huge success. Everyone loves to read about the dark side of New York. - Oh, so it's that kind of book, is it? Well, I just might have to read it then. - Why read, when I can show you the real thing? - Are you offering to be our guide? - Our guide? - Yes, my husband is coming to pick me up in a few minutes. [wine glasses clinks] [upbeat rock music] [woman sighing] ♪ I want you to get down on your knees ♪ - Rolf, don't think you've had enough to drink? - No, I'm fine thank you. I'm sorry I missed your book launching my friend, but, you know, in my world business always comes first. - Well. - Business always comes first? - First after you, [speaking in foreign language]. - You're a wise man, Rolf. - [chuckles] Yeah, let's have a toast, to whatever the night may bring. - Yes, indeed. ♪ I want you to get down on your chin ♪ ♪ I want you to overexpose my skin ♪ ♪ I want to know every twisted tale ♪ ♪ I wanna see you rip you, rip you, rip you ♪ - Dorian! ♪ I want you ♪ Cause you're my fashion victim ♪ - Dorian! ♪ Fashion victim ♪ And I'll take you, and I'll make you ♪ ♪ And I'll shake and I'll bake you ♪ ♪ And I'll use and overuse you till I'm gone ♪ [knocking] - Dorian? ♪ Fashion victim ♪ So long [mirror sliding] - Dorian! [dramatic music] [phone ringing] Hello. - [Louis] Henry. - Oh, and where have you been? - [Louis] I'm taking a vacation. - [sighs] What are you talking about? You've got a screen test at Fox next week. Not to mention the L.A. launch of the book. You haven't got time for a goddamn vacation. - [Louis] Yes, well I need a vacation, so I'm taking one, understand? - I see, so where are you going? - [Louis] Germany. - Germany, well why not? Oh, I see, so you're going with that Eurotrash bimbo and her billionaire impotent husband, are you? Look here Dorian, we have a contract. - [Louis] Body and soul, Henry? - Body and soul, Dorian. [thunder roaring] - So he just walked out on you? - Yes. - But you were still handling his dough, the book, modeling? - Well, I still had power of attorney, yes. He didn't need any money. He was living in a huge mansion in the Bavaria for God's sake. I even heard that he tried photography again, but without my influence, that got nowhere fast. He reverted back to being the toy boy he was always meant to be. [camera flash clicking] [upbeat pop music] That's how Dorian spent the next few years. He lived like kept man, a two bit gigolo. And made out like a bandit. He should've realized there was a catch. He wasn't really in the driver's seat, Rolf was. - [Rolf] Mariella love, my sweet I wanted to talk with you privately before our guest joins us. - [Mariella] Very well Rolf, about what? - [Rolf] You know, [speaking in foreign language] sometimes what you want and what I need are not the same. And I think that our dear friend Dorian has fallen into that category. - [Mariella] What do you mean? - I put a sleeping pill in his drink. He'll be sleeping for hours. - Mm, absolutely beautiful. - Gracias. - [Rolf] You know that I'm always happy to give you whatever your heart desires. - [Mariella] Yes. - But to put it delicately, I feel that Dorian has overstayed his welcome. - Are you saying you want him to leave? - [Rolf] I'm afraid so. - Dorian. - Yes. - Fly away with us. - It's time for us to say [speaking in foreign language] to Dorian. - I don't know if it's such a good idea. When are you leaving? - Another week. - [Louis] Hmm, a nice sophisticated, Euro triangle. Sounds cozy. - [Mariella] Rolf, please don't. - Please don't? I know the two of you have gotten rather close. - But it's not--. - No buts. - Rolf likes you. - Oh, and I like him great. - He's my husband and I love him, but I want you. - Do I detect a schoolgirl crush on Dorian? Grow up, he's not worthy of our attention. He's so common. - He is our friend. - I got contracts, Mariella, obligations. - I know. I am your husband, and I want him to leave. - Mariella, [mumbles]. - But he. - Don't ever contradict me, you understand? - Yes. - Now compose yourself before he arrives. - [Rolf] Let me show you something I'm sure you'll find interesting. [sighing] [door clattering] - Dorian, come in. Sit down. Mm-hm, enjoy the show. [tense, dramatic music] How about some sound? [woman moaning] - Rolf. - Turn it off. I said turn it off! [thudding] - Impotent son of a [grunts]. You don't deserve her. I'm taking her with me. - You really think so, you fool. You really think she'll leave all this for you? Take a look at her facem tell me if I'm wrong. Look at her! - I wish for once, you will stop deciding things for me. [dramatic music] Oh my! - After all I've done for you. This is how you'll repay me? - Please, please! [gun clicks] Please. - [Louis] Whoa! - Stop! - Stop it! This is crazy, stop it, please! Stop! - No! - Stop! - [Mariella] Stop it! This is crazy stop! Please, please! [gun firing] [screams] Oh! No! No, no! [crying] [dramatic music] - Henry? You okay? [sobbing] Henry! [sobbing] - Dorian, Dorian! Dorian, what are we going to do? Rolf is. What, what? - Get out, get out! - What is this? Oh my God, it's blood, the picture is bleeding, Dorian. - It's Rolf's blood. - What? - The picture is bleeding Rolf's blood. - What, Dorian, Dorian! Listen to me. Who is it in this picture? Who is it? - It's me. Me in the picture. - No, no. No, oh no! - Mariella! - No! - Mariella! - No! - Mariella, Mariella! - No, no! Mariella, Mariella, no! [dramatic music] [singing in foreign language] [heavy breathing] [painting growling] [grunting] ♪ Ah - He didn't even wait for the funerals, just took off. That was about 10 years ago. - Do you ever hear from him? - No. - What about Bae, Ms. Conick? - I don't think so. She would've told me if she had. Of course, there were rumors. Someone would run into him at some flesh pot somewhere on the planet. Some dive where they sell any kind of pleasure. You know, boys, girls, whatever they like. Pretty sordid stuff. [camera flash clicking] [upbeat music] From what I could gather, Dorian was caught in a mad race that took him spiraling into the depths of hell. Eventually landed in the midst of a perverted sex scandal in Bangkok, but charges where never laid against him. I then heard that he left Thailand soon after, to continue his depraved ways in other remote parts of the world. [crowd shouting] [woman moaning] And then about a week ago, Bae had a big retrospective in Tribeca. So I hosted a party for her at my house. [camera flash clicking] [crowd chattering] [light piano music] - [Diana] Bae darling, I loved it. It was just fabulous. - Thank you, Diana. - And you're taking it on the road? - Yes, L.A., Chicago, Dallas and maybe even Paris and London in the fall. - Oh. Oh my God, look. - Dorian. - Hello, Bae, Trina, Diana. - I don't believe it. - Dorian, look at you? - Dammit, he's still gorgeous. Dorian, I'm gonna kill you, you haven't aged a bit in 20 years. Who'd you go to, that Brazilian doctor? - Good Lord [chuckles], look what the cat dragged in. Hello Dorian. - Hello Henry. It's good to see you. - And you. - Honestly Dorian, look at yourself! - How do you look so good? - Genetics, I guess. [laughing] - Look, I'm going for a drink later on, would you care to join me? - No, I can't, I just dropped by to say hi. - Glad you turned up. - Well, where are you staying? - In the loft, just got the place all cleaned up. - Henry, we have to get going. - Mm, oh, some things never change. Well, I'm going to drive Trina home, so will you be here when I get back? - No, but I will call. - We have to talk, Dorian. - Henry, would you mind dropping me off along the way, I need my beauty sleep. - Of course not, Diana, oh Bae tomorrow. - Yes, goodbye. - Bye-bye! [speaking in foreign language] - Great to see you, Dorian. You're looking great, hm. - You must have a lot of these from the old days, huh? - Every shot I ever took of you. - I'd like to borrow your proofs. - Which ones? - All of them, just for a little while, it's really important. - Well okay, are you all right? - Yeah, yeah, it's just, it's kind of weird being back after all these years. - What are you going to do with them? - I tell you what, I'll show you when I'm done. So I can drop by tomorrow and pick those up? - Of course, call me, same old number. - I remember. - [Photographer] Spread, excellent. - [Man] Here. - Excuse me, aren't you Dorian? - No, no pictures, no pictures. - Hey Louis, you don't remember me? James, I used to live next door to you and Sybil? [camera flash clicking] - You, you're the guy who killed her! - [James] Hey! - You're the guy who put the needle in her arm! - I couldn't say no to her, man. She was hurting too much and after that guy came to see her. - What guy? - The grey haired guy. - Who Henry, Henry? - Yeah, was freaked out, man. She came to me for help, and he paid for her drugs, man. [crowd gasping] It's all right, it's all right. [crowd chattering] [upbeat rock music] - [Henry] I can believe anything. - [Mariella] Get out, get out! [eerie, monstrous screaming] [singing drowned out by music] - [Henry] There are no limits, with that sweet smile, the boyish grin. [man shouting] Forever Dorian, forever. [shouting] You'll go all the way. We could rule this business. What do you do? You want to play? - [Louis] No, no! Get down! [upbeat rock music] - [Henry] Yes, yes! - [Louis] No! - [Sibyl] Go on, forget your photography! Forget your dreams, just throw it all away and go uptown to your jerkoff party. [shouting] [heavy breathing] [shouting] - [Henry] Look here Dorian, we had a contract. [women shouting over each other] [shouting] - [Voiceover] Mariella, Mariella! [screaming] [singers shouting rhythmically] - [Henry] Dorian came to Bae's studio and took away all the photographs that she'd taken of him. Then on New Year's Eve, Bae had a premonition and she insisted that I call him. [phone rings] - Nothing. - Good luck. [dramatic, melancholy music] [door clanking] [Dorian coughing] [door knocking] [door clattering] [keys jingling] - Dorian? Dorian? Dorian? [dramatic music] - Hello Bae. - Dorian, what. - I've been working for days, then I crashed. - Why is it so hot in here? - I love the desert. Have you ever seen two scorpions fight to the death? It's beautiful. - Let's get some light into here. - No, I like it dark! - No, no, you're hurting me! - Ow! [grunting] - What's wrong with you? Dorian. My pictures. - Yeah, I've got some shit to work out. Don't like what I did with your shots? [screams] I've got you! [Bae screaming] - What have I done to you? - Remember this, recognize your great work of art? - No, that's not mine, Henry shot it. - Henry! - I tried to warn you. - Warn me, about what? Henry, you knew. - Ow, you're not the first caught in Henry's trap. He's been hunting forever. - You promised me, Bae. - Ow! - What did you trade your soul for, huh? - I did it for my art. - Your art? [screams] Was it worth it? [sobbing] Why Bae? Why? - Dorian, I'm so sorry. [dramatic music] I have to set you free. - No! - [screams] I have to do this! [Louis speaking drowned out by music] I have to go! [phone beeping] [phone ringing] - Come on Bae. Damn. [eerie electronic music] [knocking] - Ah, there is someone home. - Ah. [door clattering] I thought you had a key to this place. - Where's Bae? - Drink? - I lent Bae my key, she wants to see you. Of course, naturally, you weren't answering your phone. What's that smell? - Oh, just a little eating in. So you went to see Sybil, [clears throat] the night she died, didn't you? - Did I, huh? [chuckles] Did Bae come over here? - Yeah, you want that drink? - [chuckles] Well, where is she now? - She's over there. [tense music] - Bae. Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me, I hate it. - She tried to cut my picture. - Poor Dorian. It's a good thing you stopped her. When that picture dies, so do you. - What are you gonna do, Henry, call the police? - [laughs] The police, good Lord no, of course not, no. No, actually, I was looking for that drink you offered me. We can toast our future together, because this goes on forever, remember? How does that quotation go? What does it profit a man, if to gain the whole world and lose his soul? [dramatic, eerie music] Soul. [sighs] Oh Dorian. How lucky you are. What an exquisite life you've had. You've drunk deeply of everything. Nothing has ever been hidden from you. And it's all being no more than the sound of music to you. But it hasn't marred you, you're still just the same. - No, I am not the same, Henry. - Yes. Yes, you are. You are perfect. Flawless. I wish I could change places with you. The world cried out against us both. But it has always worshiped you. I'm so glad that you haven't had any talent. You never carved a statue or painted or picture or produced anything outside yourself. Your life has been your art. Your days are your sonnets. [tense, dramatic music] [photograph growling] - No! No! - [Henry] Dorian, stop it, Dorian, stop it! - Give it to me, Henry! - Stop it, no! - Henry, it's over! - Don't be a fool, no! [groaning] Dorian! - Henry! [grunting] - [Henry] Dorian! - No! [grunts] [groans] [eerie squeaking] [sighing] [phone beeping] - Yes, can you send an ambulance to 122 Spring, top floor loft. Yes, yes it's an emergency. - Mr. Wooten. Mr. Wooten. Where's the picture? - Do you want to see it? - Yeah. Son of a bitch. I think we're gonna wrap this up for now. I may have some questions later. Would you like a lift home? - Thanks, I'll take a cab. - All right. [tense music] Mr. Wooten. Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. [door clanking] Taxi! [car engine revving] Hi. - [Taxi Driver] Hey. - Deliver this to 354 East 83rd. - [Taxi Driver] Yeah, right.
