Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - How are you? Goodness! - Enrique! How’ve you been? It’s been a long time. And in the end I went for the red. - You look gorgeous. Thank you! - Where were you? - Talking with Cristian. - Hey, what’s up? I’m happy to see you. Alejandra... Alejandra, honey. - Am I intruding? - Well, that depends... - Come on. You were dodging me for three days. - Sandra, you’re so dogged with this. I’ve told you that I can’t. - Help me, please. I can’t do another year studying and working at the same time. Catering is just wearing my feet out! One more year of serving weddings and I’ll be flat out of toes. - What if something happens to the camera? Do you know how hard it is for me to pay for it? - Look, I'll arrange the interviews for your days off, and it’ll work! - And what's in it for me apart from losing my day off? - My eternal gratitude! You owe me. Pas très à l’aise avec pablo. Well, remember that! Remember who introduced you to him. Thank you so much, my friend. I love you. - You’re really hard-headed, you know... Besides, I don't understand what the rush is all about. If you still don't know what you’re going to do the project over. - Alright, alright. That was the day before yesterday. Now I got it... Crystal clear! - Of course. Unmistakably clear! Of course. Transparent. - It's just that... I am not convinced by any of the topics. I only know that it should be practical and audio-visual. Just think about it, I can also give it a more cinematic approach... - Look. Here is the topic for your project. That missing painter. Yeah... nobody talks much about her. - You know? I know her-Well, I knew her. My parents were friends with her family at the beach. - Really?! Not only the camera, but also the content. I don't owe you anything now. It’s been three months since Alejandra López went missing and no clues have yet been found to guide the police as to her whereabouts. - Any statement, please? Look, I have nothing to say. Please respect my family's privacy. Thank you very much. -Please, Arturo. Would you like to make a statement? - All I want is for them to find my daughter, please. We cannot go on living like this. It’s a nightmare. Her name is Alejandra. My daughter's name is Alejandra. - Please... - Let's go, Mom. Sorry, my mother needs to rest. Hello. Elena. Carmelo, qu’est-ce que tu fais ici? I need to talk to you for a moment, just a minute. - I don't have the time now. Get out of my way, Carmelo. - Elena, wait. Calm down just for a moment. -I said I can’t right now. I am in a hurry. - I'm just asking you for a minute, listen to me. Look. Yesterday a journalist called me saying that she was investigating Alejandra's disappearance... - That's none of your business... -How is it none of my business?! It's affecting my health! - Your health? - Yes. I’m waiting for some test results and I’m really scared. Look, Elena. I just want to see your parents... - Come on, Carmelo. My parents don't want to see you. Leave them alone. And I'm sure you’re fine. You’re just psychosomatic with all this. - Elena, please, I’m begging you. I already told you what you’d have to do if you really wanted to help. -I'll do anything. -Give us back my sister's personal belongings. Especially her notebooks and sketches; you know my father wants them. - Elena, let's not start with that again. Alejandra is... She was, my wife. And these things were left in our house. - I'm driving, what the hell do you want? Yes, I have a copy on my home computer, yes. I am on my way there. Well, have them wait! Yes, have them wait. They can wait. - I just want to find Alejandra. And nobody is doing anything... - The police are handling it. - The police?! Well, that journalist... Carmelo, please. She’s just a student. - Yes, alright. Yes, don't tell me again. Fuck! I'm heading home to get the backup. Well, what else do you want me to do? Shit. Yes, yes. I can hear the yelling. That girl is crazy, man! - she called us too. Don't make a big deal of it. - But she says there is new information-I don't know, the police must have told you something. - Look, let's do something. You bring me my sister's drawings and we'll talk. - That's all I have left of her. - Carmelo, you have to go; I promise to have coffee with you tomorrow. I swear. - But where? When? Uhm... at five? Yes, at five o'clock at the café where Alejandra always went. At the Avelino. Bring my sister's drawings. That way my parents will relax and I can convince them to see you, okay? - But will you do it? - I will try. I can’t promise anything, but I will try to convince them. Goodbye. - Yes, alright. Yes. I'm looking for it, OK. Of course, of course it has to be here, damnit. Hey, can you wait?! It doesn’t seem to be here. I don't know, I don't know, it's not here. It’s not here. Do you really think I did it to annoy you or what? Which is my job too, you know. Yes, yes. I know it’s money. And I really need it too. Damnit! OK man, I get it. I'm on my way. OK. Fucking computer. Fuck me. Fuck! -Julio, Julio. Please calm down. -Calm down, me? Look, you haven't seen me upset, you haven't seen me upset! - Honey, please stop. -Just stop. You want me to stop? You really want me to stop? I’ll stop. - Did you have to smash it? Savage. - But what do you care? It was mine. -I don't like it when you behave like this. - Like what? -Like a wild beast. - You didn't seem to mind it too much a little while ago. -You pig, you're a pig. Get out. I want you to leave. -Leave? What do you mean? Psycho. -Get your stuff right now and get out of here! This is not right. - Hey, take it easy. - No. I want it to end. This is not right. - You’re the one that wanted it. You really wanted it. -Not true. My sister is missing. And all I can think of is to hook up with her boyfriend. - Hey, stop the car and don’t get things mixed up. Alejandra and I were nothing when she vanished. Alejandra wanted to leave me but I was the one who left her. Because no one dumps me. Do you get that? Nobody breaks up with ME. - Come on, are you ready? Let's record the call. -Record a police inspector? Like this? Without his permission? Girl... I don’t know. - Record him, no way. Record me. Well... Girl... I don’t know. - Record him, no way. Record me. - Well... However you want. - Alright, let’s get started. -Yes? - Hello, good morning. Is this Inspector Garcia? - Yes. Who is this? Is this Inspector Garcia? - Yes. Who is this? -Look. My name is Sandra Fuentes. I study journalism and, well... I am doing my final degree project on the disappearance of Alejandra López de Lemos and... -One second. Juan, send me the file on Alejandra López de Lemos. Yes. Continue. -Well, I understand that you are handling the case and I would like to ask you a few questions. - The press office already sent out all that information. - Right. I've got it all here. But my project is focused on how the media influences research of this kind. And... I would need to do a video interview with you, because the project is an audio-visual report. -E-mail a request to our press department at the police station and they’ll contact you if it checks out. -I only need ten minutes of your time. -So the sooner you send that request, the sooner you’ll get an answer. - Just a moment, please. Let me ask you just one question. Is the case closed? -We don’t close cases. That’s the court’s job. This case is provisionally closed for lack of evidence. This does not mean that it cannot be reopened should any evidence related to the initial investigation come to light. -But, it was closed anyway? Because no body has been found. - The corpse is the key piece of evidence in a possible homicide case. However, missing persons cases such as this, where we don’t know the conclusion; it’s just one of the investigation's hypotheses. - So what is the main hypothesis they are working on? - Nothing can be ruled out, Miss. Now you must excuse me. I have a lot of work to do. But look. Let's do one thing. You send that e-mail and we will see what I can do. - Right. Of course. Thank you very much, Inspector. Thank you very much. - Goodbye, good day. - Goodbye, goodbye. - Good job! -Why are there pages missing from this notebook, Carmelo? Did you tear them out? - No. -Well, they’re not there. -Well, I don't know. I have nothing else. Alejandra took everything to her new studio. -I remember my sister showing me a series of drawings that are not here. It was what she was working on. When she disappeared. -Yes, I knew that. But... I don't know. -I'm talking about a series of drawings, let's say... Erotic ones. -I don't like this accusing tone you are using, Elena. Look, I've brought you everything I've found. What more do you want? - No, no. no. What is it that YOU want? You are the one planted on my doorstep. -What I wanted... I just wanted to tell you I miss you all very much. I loved your sister with all my heart. And I still love her. I’m only asking for the chance to go back and spend some time with your parents. Is that so much to ask? - It's been two years now. Time enough for you to rebuild your life. -The only thing going on here is that you still think I had something to do with Alejandra's disappearance. -Believe me, if that were the case I wouldn't be sitting here. -I've brought you the drawings for nothing... -They're not all here! You know this perfectly well. -You and I made a deal. -Look for the rest of the drawings I told you about, Carmelo. Bring them to me and I’ll consider speaking with my parents about talking to you. -I did my part. -What part was that? - Ana, you gave me such a fright, where did you come in from? -Sorry, María. I came in through the door. - Why didn't you let me know you were coming? -Well, you won't believe who I saw this afternoon. - Who? - Alejandra's ex-husband and sister together, having coffee. - Carmelo and Elena? - Yes, yes. It's strange, isn't it? - Well, maybe... I don't know. - Carmelo brought her some drawings. - Drawings? What drawings? - Well, I don't know. From where I was I couldn't see them. Yesterday a journalist called me to ask for an interview. - A journalist? - Well, a student, yes. She wants to interview us. She was very pushy, but I liked her. - How did that girl get your phone number? And how did she know we were her friends? -Because we are your friends. And she said something that I can't stop thinking about... - What? - Well, what my friend, the lawyer, told me, that the police go as far as they have to go, that everything else is a private initiative. - But the prices of detectives are outrageous. - Not for a woman with a husband rotten with money. -And stingy as a rat, who doesn't even want to spend the thirty euros for the airport taxi fare. I have to pick him up myself. Besides, I told you to check with Alejandra's parents beforehand. -We have to do it, for her. We will not be able to close this chapter until they find a body to bury. - Don't say that. - What do you think she would have done for us? -Ana, please… -We owe it to her. She was an illuminated soul. She taught us so much. She would have done the same for us. You're so stubborn. -And remember to review tomorrow's agenda. -Excuse me, Professor Arturo. Professor Arturo. -These are my working hours, come back during visiting hours. -But, Professor Arturo, we’re not students. -Professor Arturo, we’re your daughter Alejandra's friends, Ana and María. Don't you remember us? She gave us painting lessons. -Yes, of course I remember. Well, what do you want? -Sorry to bother you, we thought it would be better to talk about it in person. -We wanted to discuss a matter. - What matter? -The investigation into your daughter's disappearance. - That's in the hands of the police, I can't do anything about it. - Exactly what we came here to talk about. We believe that, the investigation... - Now, wait, you believe, you may have hunches, impressions, but you don’t have enough information to form an opinion. - But there is clearly no progress. - Progress... well... - But, you see... - Let's see, do you know anything new? - No. But we thought we could do something on a private basis. - The best thing you can both do is to stay out of it. - But, it’s been over a year and we want to have the consent of the family. - The family is doing everything possible. - Well, we’re resolved to hiring a private detective. - Ana, please. - You are going to do what? - A detective, with your permission. - You don’t have it, of course. - We are going to do it anyway. - So why did you come here to bother me? - Ana, shut up for a moment. Professor Arturo, please forgive my friend. Having a detective doesn’t mean interfering with the police; in fact, they complement each other. And we will cover all the costs. - What are you talking about? - We are just trying to find Alejandra. - No one wants to find my daughter more than I do. And leave me alone, I have an Academia meeting. And you should at least have the humility to see that you two poor dupes are just playing Agatha Christie. - I know Álvaro can't make it at that time and Mercedes can't either, but it's the only time I can. Exactly. - Professor Arturo, good afternoon. Good afternoon. - My name is Laura Leiva, mind if I speak to you for a moment. - Alright, but only for a moment. ...Go ahead, talk. I am listening. - Speak, speak. I am listening. - The thing is... Well, forgive me for dropping in on you like this. But, I am finishing my Master's degree in Asset Management. I would be very interested in having you direct my thesis. - Impossible. - Impossible… - Yes, look, Miss... - Laura, Laura Leiva. - Miss Leiva, it is impossible for me because right now I have three theses on the table. - But, you are the foremost authority on the subject I want to discuss, Professor Arturo. Romanticism paintings in Seville. -Well, until a couple of years or more from now, it won’t be possible. - And you don't have an opening? I just can't wait that long. You see, I was your student years ago. Isn’t there a way? -Miss, I'm telling you it's impossible. You see, I was your student years ago. Isn’t there a way? -Miss, I'm telling you it's impossible. -I urgently need to get started, Professor Arturo. I just don't have that kind of time. I was looking after a sick relative, you know? - A sick relative? -Yes, my father, who died last year, was bedridden for three years. - My goodness, I'm so sorry. - Thank you. - And you were looking after him for all three years? - Yes. - Stop by my office tomorrow at eleven o'clock and we'll see what we can do. - Thank you very much, Professor Arturo, thank you! -Goodbye. -Flora. Flora. Hey, sleepyhead, wake up, it's already late. I see you’ve taken your medication, very good. Please come here. -Good morning. -Look, I'm bringing you someone to look after you. - Another one? - Flora, it's Laura. - I don't want any more nurses, Arturo. - She’s not a nurse. She comes from the University. And she can keep you company when Elena and I can't. - She is also a very well-read girl. She is very interested in art. - Have you spoken to Carmelo yet? - With Carmelo? - Yes, with your son-in-law. He called yesterday. - He is not my son-in-law and I have nothing to say to him. - Yes, with your son-in-law. He called yesterday. - He is not my son-in-law and I have nothing to say to him. - Please, you have to talk to him. He told me he knows something. He says he has something important to tell us. - Flora, don’t start. Please, don’t start. - The bathroom is over there on the right. Can you get some water? - Arturo… - Do me a favour and calm down. - Listen to me. He knows something, I'm sure he knows something. Please… - Stop it now. - I can't let it be. We need to find our child. - Do you want to? You’ll see how Laura keeps you company. - But, she can't help me find my daughter either. - But many people are. For example, the police. - Yes, but the days just keep on passing. One day, and then the next, and no... - Enough. That's it. That's it. You have to get over it. OK? Alright… - What did you say your name was? - My name is Laura. I will help you in any way I can. -Don't treat me like I'm crazy. Hand me the glasses. Come closer. You have a nice face, Laura. I’m sorry I can’t look after you as well as I should. - No, it's my job to look after you. - Did you know my little girl? - No, she doesn’t. - Flora, you can talk to me about anything. I am sorry for what happened, but I don't know your daughter. - Alejandra has hair like this, just like yours, Deep black, long and... - When Alejandra disappeared you had been separated for six months, right? - How was the relationship with her during this time? - Well, bad, to be honest. Separations are always complicated. - Do you still love her? - If you don't mind, I'm not going to answer that. - Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to ask that. - Who can forget the love of their life? -the person you have loved the most... Who can do that? Especially in such circumstances. - And how did you find out that Alejandra had disappeared? - I heard about it on television. No one in the family had the courtesy to call me. - I’ve read comments that you are still the primary suspect, how do you cope with all the pressure from the media? - Could you hand me the document I signed earlier, please? - Yes, of course. Here you are. - Thank you. - But Carmelo, what's going on, why did you break it? - Because I've changed my mind. Your questions are insulting. - So I have nothing more to say. And you, turn the camera off. Go and interview Alejandra's last lover He’s a piece of work. - And in the end what? Are we just going to sit back and do nothing? - The mother and Elena are also there. - We can call Elena, the sister. - Sûr, et on découvrira ce qu'elle faisait avec Carmelo l'autre jour.- Right, and then also find out what Carmelo and her were up to the other day. - I'm going to call her. - She’s not answering. - Elena, the telephone! Elena, where are you? - Alejandra, Alejandra, is that you? - Elena? I am Ana, Alejandra's friend. - Ana? Which Ana? - Excuse me, are you Elena's mother, Flora? - But where is Alejandra? They don't want to tell me. - I don't know, Flora! I miss her a lot too. - Everybody knows but nobody wants to tell me. - Everybody? Who is everybody? Qui est tout le monde, Flora Who is everybody, Flora? - Do you know where my Alejandra is? - I'm going to find her, Flora. We will look for her and we’ll find her, I promise. I promise. - Why are you crying? - I’m crying with joy, Flora, with joy. Goodbye, goodbye. - María, I… Maria this chain is the only thing I have that might be worth something. Use it to find her, okay? She loved me very much. Alejandra opened her home to me when I had nothing and helped me find my way in life. Maria, let's find her, please. - Ana, I will hire the detective immediately. Alejandra is like our sister. Forgive me for being slow to make this decision and for not believing you. I'm afraid that Alejandra is dead. - Interpol has been working further and has indications that Alejandra López de Lemos may be in Colombia. All other information is confidential. We will continue to report as investigations progress. - Professor Arturo, I thought you were out. I didn’t hear you come in. - Hello Laura, how are you today? - Fine, fine. The new treatment is going much better for her, I've managed to get her to sleep a little less, and distract her by reading. - Well, I'm glad to hear it. That is good. - Are you all right? - No, my shoulder, just a bit bothered. - That's got to be a muscle spasm. I took a chiropractic massage course; do you mind...? - Ok… What a relief! I can't thank you enough. - You are under a lot of stress, weighed down with worries… The body normally suffers from this, and it is normal. Better? - Yes. You see, Laura, we need you to spend more time in the house because I have a trip and you know my wife can't be alone. - Don't worry. She is in good hands. - Your questions are offensive and I have nothing more to say, and turn the camera off. Go and interview Alejandra's last lover. That, that… - Well, write the conclusions and that's it. - I have no conclusions. We still need to interview the family, and I want to… - They don't want to talk to you. Don't insist anymore; you're incredibly stubborn. - Well, then... with her friends. - I can’t anymore, Sandra. It’s over. - What do you mean, it's over? - What are you trying to say? Find Alejandra by yourself. I managed to get an appointment with the detective. With all the work I've put in, you can't leave me stranded now, come on. - I can't meet up anymore. - But why not? - Because I want to spend the little free time I have with my boyfriend, if you don't mind. - With your boyfriend? - Yes, with my boyfriend. Besides, he told me that you are manipulative and are abusing me. - Manipulative? What the hell are you talking about, Pilar?! - Just what I said. Look, I was doing you a favour, but I can't meet up with you anymore. Ok? If you don't get it... - Do you understand what I'm saying? Fuck you and your fucking boyfriend! - Professor Arturo! Professor Arturo… - What is it? - Your wife. -Flora, what's going on? What are you doing? - I’m leaving. I heard on the radio that she’s in Colombia, so I'm going to Colombia to look for my daughter. -No, no. Calm down. Wait a second. - Calm down? Wait?; I'm not waiting! I won’t keep waiting any longer. - Please, calm down. - My daughter is in Colombia. I have to go and look for her. Nobody is doing anything. You’re not doing anything. Nobody is. Our girl... - Listen to me. Listen to me! You’re right-I will do something. This is long overdue. - You are not going to do anything. Nobody does anything and you... - Look me in the eyes, look at me! Have I ever lied to you? I told you I'm going to do something and I'm going to do it. -What a surprise, Professor Arturo! What are you doing here, is something wrong? - Does something have to be wrong for me to come to my house? -No, no. Of course not. Make yourself at home, of course. - That's right. I am at home. I’m the one that pays for it. - Yes, I was just surprised to see you here. - I'm still surprised to see you here. - What's going on, do you have any plans to keep the house? Because I see that you are very comfortable. First with Alejandra and now with Elena. You young people think you know everything. But you don't have a clue. - What do you mean by that? I have a copy of the keys because your daughter Elena gave them to me. I have a flat near the bar. -Great! I would expect no less. Do you want a drink? -No, thank you. I've been serving drinks all fucking night. - Relax man. Relax. Have you heard the latest news about Alejandra? -Yes, Elena told me. -Look, I'm going to look for my daughter wherever I can. You're going to help me, aren't you? -Do you want me to come with you to Colombia? -To Colombia? No, man, no. The police don’t have a clue. If anyone knows where she is, it’s Carmelo. - Carmelo? That bastard? - That bastard knows more than he's telling. - And how do you know? - I don't know, but I'm going to find out. I think it just takes a little more nudging. - And what do I have to do with all this? - I may be a bit older, but I'm no slouch. But I can't do it alone. I need your help. -Professor Arturo, I… I can't help you. - Why not? - Because I have a record. - A record. - Yes, a record. I beat up a jealous husband and almost killed him. The last thing I need is to stand before a judge again. - Do you think this will be enough to overlook this... this record? Carmelo goes to a country house he inherited from his grandparents, every Friday. It is secluded, surrounded by orange trees and there is hardly any coverage. I know this because my wife could never locate Alejandra when they spent the weekends there. It is an ideal place to have a quiet chat with him. - Stop! Professor Arturo, what are you planning to do? What's that baseball bat for, Julio? - Who are you? How do you know our names? - I know a lot of things and I know what you intend to do. - Who says so? - That's coming from someone who has a gun license. So you can both turn around and go back to where you came from. Don't make me repeat myself. They looked set to give him a beating. - Those two? Yes. - But, Professor Arturo…? - I knew it. I knew it. So much righteousness always hides something shady. - Are you sure? Absolutely. They were also very determined and emboldened. It was funny to watch them trying to maintain what little dignity they had left. - And how do you know they were going to beat up Carmelo? - Julio was holding a baseball bat. - I don't think they were going to play at that time of night. - And this clears them of suspicion. - Sure, if they were going to provoke Carmelo by force. By force, you said. Such a confession would not be valid. It does not prove anyone's innocence. In any case, these developments may seem quite new, but we are at the same point: a stalemate. My contacts managed to get me the notification from the Colombian police, it’s a customs report. A woman with a Spanish passport crossed the border a month ago, her name is Alejandra López de Lemos. It may be a coincidence, but I need you to sign your approval for the extra expenses to Colombia. This avenue is worth investigating. - If you have to investigate, investigate. The sooner the better. - You always preferred her. The prettiest. The one who fit in everywhere. The apple of your eye. Your little princess. You never noticed the effort I made to get your attention. I traded my youth in for books and those eternal civil service exams. I am still unsatisfied and don't know what to do with my life. I am now with Julio. With my sister’s leftovers. And I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or still revelling in my misfortune, in my jealousy. I still dream about Alejandra every night. And sometimes I feel that... her disappearance has a sense of guilt for everyone. Because of their selfishness, because of your frivolity, Because of Dad's arrogance, Because of my envy. Our family is a script for a cheap opera, a rural drama. Perhaps we deserved everything that happened to us. I'm going to make dinner. - How are you doing, sweetheart? I made your favourite, teriyaki chicken salad. - My back hurts a lot. - You still have that? Let's see, are you doing your stretches? - I am suffocating. I can't breathe. I'm drowning. I need some sun. To breathe fresh air. - But here you do practically the same thing you did at home. Drawing, lying in bed and reading all day. Nothing else. - I don't have internet. I don't have television. Did you forget to buy my charcoal fixative again? - There are things I can't do. I am closely watched. - Jerk. The humidity is getting to me, just so you know. My joints ache. I have rheumatism. - Please, my grandfather was in hiding here for thirty years after the war and never complained of rheumatism. - I don't give a shit what happened to your grandfather. I wish they had shot him. I wish they had shot him! That hurts. Give me a massage. How's that? - It's nice, isn't it? - Yes. Yes, it’s nice. - So that later you can say that I never did anything for you. - A confirmed cynic! Think I forget who you are? - And who exactly am I? - An immature lunatic, a disturbed nutcase, a psychopath. You think your manners make me forget that you are a criminal? A kidnapper! You're going to get a good sentence for it. - I am already sentenced, Alejandra. I told you a thousand times, this confinement is just temporary. And this hole is hardly filthy. My grandfather was here throughout... - Fuck off, you and your fucking grandfather! My grandfather was here throughout... What a dirty tongue you have! One day I'm going to wash it with bleach. - Just let me go, Carmelo. - It’ll be over soon enough, really. - What will be over soon enough? But, what will be over? How long have I been here? I need to get out. Help! - Alejandra... Alejandra, please hear me out... Can we talk? - No. No, we can't talk, Carmelo. Everything has already been said and more than said. - Alejandra, please… - I'll take these books too. And my Gala too, of course. - No way! The dog is from home! - We'll see about that! - Alexandra please, I beg you... Go back home. - I can't, I'm running late. But why can’t I return... - I've told you a thousand times, I don't love you anymore. You even disgust me a bit… - How can you say that? - It is the truth. I look at you and I see you... ugly, almost disgusting. What do you want me to say if that's how I feel? - I don't know you anymore, Alejandra... And we've been married for five years? - And now that I think about it, I remember it all as a bad dream. What is left of that great artist I fell in love with in college who was going to be the new Picasso? You can’t even sell a single painting at the flea market in the Museum Square! You live in the country, off your parents’ inheritance. - And who do you think you are? Because you are nothing more than a cheap painting teacher for unemployed women! Look at you! The professor's spoiled brat! Your entire life has been given to you! You haven't been through half of what I've had to go through! - The poor little traumatised orphan is out! You were late! You want me to cry about it? - No! What I want is for you to listen to me! You want me to cry about it? - No! What I want is for you to listen to me! - Fuck you, Carmelo! Take your fucking books! I want you to listen to me! - Fuck you, Carmelo! Take your fucking books! You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer right now, - because I'm going to keep everything! - Yeah? But first you're going to listen to me! You're going to listen to me! - No Carmelo, let me go! Because I'm going to keep everything! - Yeah? But first you're going to listen to me! You're going to listen to me! - No Carmelo, let me go! - No, no, no... you have to listen to me! - Let me go, Carmelo! But first you're going to listen to me! You're going to listen to me! - No Carmelo, let me go! - No, no, no... you have to listen to me! - Let me go, Carmelo! - Let me go, let go of me! - No, no, no... you have to listen to me! - Let me go, Carmelo! Let me go, let go of me! Carmelo! Let go of me! You're choking me! You are choking me, Carmelo! You are choking me, Carmelo! - Alejandra? Alejandra? - I never meant to kidnap you. I just wanted us to simmer down and to be able to talk calmly. I wanted to convince you to come home, to give me a second chance... We all deserve a second chance. Then I thought of bringing you to the only place where we could be alone. Alejandra, calm down... Really, you don't have much more time left here. - How can I believe you after being locked up here for so long...? - I don't have much more time left either... Neither here, nor anywhere else. I have cancer. I have little time left to live. I'm going to get my punishment. I have been condemned to death for a long time. And it has arrived... - What are you saying, Carmelo? Come here... Come here... Come here, Carmelo. Sit down. - It’s true... That's the real reason I've had you here all this time. A few months ago I was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and I wanted to spend the last days of my life with you. - Why didn't you tell me? - And then what? Would you have come back home, to look after me, if I had asked you to? - I don't know, Carmelo. But now I'll never know. But how much time do you have left? - I don’t know... I am waiting for a second opinion. I was told three or four months, but... It's been more than six. - More than six? Are you feeling well? Sometimes I get a bit of a headache. But I think it's more the stress than the cancer. - But what if you suddenly die...? What'll happen to me?! - No, no, no, no... calm down. Don't worry, my lawyer has the manuscript of my confession in an envelope with your whereabouts, that would be opened the day after my death. But that won’t happen. That's not going to happen, I swear I'll get you home first. I swear. Besides, as I have already told you, you have very little time left here, Alejandra. Here you have days left... hours... It's up to you. - Up to me? - Alejandra, I am so sorry for what I have done to you. Believe me. - Carmelo... this is not right. This is not fair to me. - You...? You're going to talk to me... of what is right? - No! Carmelo. Carmelo, please listen to me for a second. You’ve already held me against my will for way too long, please Carmelo. Carmelo no... no! - I would be very happy if you put on the dress I bought you. I have not yet had you as I want to have you before I leave, but I will have you… - But let's see: Carmelo has always been the prime suspect, hasn't he? Are you sure he had nothing to do with the disappearance...? - Curiosity killed the cat. - Sorry, sorry... - Of course Carmelo was the prime suspect. From the very first minute of the investigation! Switch off the camera. - But are we done yet? - Please turn off the recording. What I'm about to tell you, I've never said this before. Are we clear? We bugged Carmelo's houses without the judge's knowledge. - Houses...? - Yes, one in the city and the other in the countryside. We listened to it for months, And do you know what we discovered? - What? - Absolutely nothing incriminating. And do you know what we discovered? - What? - Absolutely nothing incriminating. So we had to drop that line of investigation. - Shit... that’s too much... - And now if you will excuse me. Duty calls. - But Inspector, we've only just started! We are not finished. - I told you ten minutes and we've been chatting for more than half an hour. - I can wait here until you come back. I am not in a hurry. - No, but I am. I’m in a hurry to get home. And now I'm going to a meeting... I'm afraid it's going to be a while. - But when will I be able to interview you again? - You've got plenty of material, young lady. Besides, you already know more than the judge. I hope your investigation goes well. - Thank you very much, Inspector. - Professor Arturo, good afternoon. - Hello, Laura. How is everything? - I'm fine. Your wife is sleeping. She took her sedative. She was just very agitated today. Well, she’ll be able to rest until dinner then, right? She takes too many sleeping pills, don't you think? - Yes. Yes, perhaps... But, it’s just that, she doesn't want to live. The doctor recommends sedation to keep her from doing something crazy. - Now I understand why she took the sedatives out of the bedroom and left them in your office, of course. - I don't really know what to do anymore. This situation is over my head. - Yes, I understand. You, however, seem so full of life. It doesn't have to be easy, does it? - No, it is not. The only thing that makes my day a little brighter is knowing that you are here. You’ve brought some life into this house. - That's flattering. Thank you. I have always admired you, Professor. And for me there is also a time of the day that I love... when you walk through that door. You also bring something to this house. A sense of... firmness, of... strength, and intelligence. - Laura? Laura, are you there? - Professor, what's wrong? Professor, is something wrong? Professor, are you all right? - Professor? Silly professor. But what happened? - What has happened? - What had to happen has happened. - It's... What about my wife? - Your wife is fast asleep and hasn’t heard a thing. She won't ever know. - But what are you saying? This can't happen again. - Well, we'll see about that. - No, Laura... No... Laura, stop it! Sorry. This is all my fault. Flora and I... it's been a long time since... You are so young. Sorry. I have been selfish. Look, the best thing to do is to leave this house to avert more serious problems. -No, no. Forgive me. It was my fault. I feel something very strong since attending your first class. The only thing I will ask is that you don’t tell me to leave this house. I need to be close to you, do you understand? I need... The only thing I will ask is that you don’t tell me to leave this house. I need to be close to you, do you understand? I need... to be around you. - Laura, don't insist. Please... Laura, stop it! to be near you. - Laura, don't insist. Please... Laura, stop it! Hey, look, if... if it's a question of money... - Are you going to throw me out like a whore? But who do you think I am, professor? - Please keep your voice down. - Laura? - I didn't mean to offend you, I just wanted to help you. Look, let's do one thing... Look, if you want, finish this week and I'll pay you for the whole month. But only this week. It will be the best thing for everyone. - Oops, what are you doing here? - Nothing, looking for some cufflinks I thought I'd left around here. - Oops, what are you doing here? - Nothing, looking for some cufflinks I thought I'd left around here. - Hey, have you seen Laura? - No. - I'm just very hungry. - That’s good! Well, let's go to the kitchen and have some of the cakes I brought you and some pennyroyal. Afterwards, I have to go out and do some shopping. - But then, has the tumour disappeared? - Excuse me, Mr Aguado, what did you say? - Yes, doctor, the tumour you diagnosed me with. Is it still there, is it malignant? Tell me something, please. I am ready. Is it still there? Is it malignant? Tell me something, please. I am ready. - Mr Aguado, I diagnosed you with migraines, headaches. Perhaps triggered by the stress you told me you were going through because of your separation. - I didn't... I didn't understand that, no. No way. - Mr Aguado, perhaps you should make an appointment with a psychologist. You have to mourn and bury the past once and for all. And bury the past once and for all. And bury the past once and for all. - Get undressed. Come on, girls, clothes off. Let's take the photos. - How? - Come on, don't be shy. Didn't you want to be the muses for my next painting? - Come on, don't be shy. Didn't you want to be the muses for my next painting? - But were you serious? - Absolutely. From these photos I will make studies that I will turn into a large format painting. Come on, what's the matter? - But I don't know if I have a tummy for photos. - Don't worry, no one will see these photos, except me. - Surprise! Look, I baked your favourite cake. - Yummy... I want to try it. - I made it for you because today is a very special day … I couldn't help myself. - I couldn't help myself. - Serves me right for trusting you. Next time I'll bring you some slaps. You're very funny. - Look, I had made it for you to celebrate our wedding anniversary tomorrow. Today is the sixth. Don’t you remember? - But how can I remember if I don't know what day it is? - Alejandra, I have been thinking it over. And this is a mistake, this... This is a serious mistake. - Let go of me now, Carmelo. - That's my point. Look, I was thinking of releasing you for our anniversary, tomorrow. - Really? - Yes. - Why not now? - Because before I would like to... ask you one last favour. I would like to sleep with you one last time. - Just sleep? - Yes, yes. I just want to feel your body next to mine. Like when we were in love. - So then, We sleep together and you'll let me go tomorrow? Promise? I accept. - Perfect. - Look, I'm here with my mother and my niece - how beautiful! Hey, look at the pictures I found of your daughter with her friends. These women are a bit naughty, aren't they? Well, almost as much as her husband. It has to run in the family. This one is the best. I say... - Give me that... - Get off me! Damnit! - But, Laura, what's going on here, what are you doing? - Just what we needed. The honourable dean! Our coming honorary holy week officer! The irreproachable husband. - What are you talking about? - We all have something to hide, don't we? Your daughter, for example, taking dirty pictures with her friends. Do you know the friends in these photos? Perhaps... you had them hidden because you took them. They might even be why Alejandra went missing. - Give them to me... - Don't come closer or I'll scream. Did you tell your wife what we did the other day? Don't come any closer! Otherwise I will post the photos for everyone to see. So stay away. - But who are you? Why are you doing this to me? - Who am I? I’m Laura Leiva. Do you remember me now, professor? When I begged you to pass me, when I knelt before you as I did ten years ago now. - Laura Leiva… - You're remembering now, aren't you? I am that poor girl who desperately needed your pass. But no. You did not consent, not even by a mere tenth. By one tenth, Professor. ‘This exam is not for passing’. Don’t you remember? They took my scholarship away and I had to go back to the village to work in crappy jobs. - Laura, I understand, but this is not the way. Let's talk about it like civilised people to work in crappy jobs. - Laura, I understand, but this is not the way. Let's talk about it like civilised people. - No, no, now listen to me in a civilised manner. I understand, but this is not the way. Let's talk about it like civilised people. No, no, now listen to me in a civilised manner. Because that's what works for you. To begin with, you're going to have to admit me into your department because otherwise I will, in a “civilized manner”... make sure everyone can see these photos. - But what have we done to you, why do you want to hurt us? - Ask your husband, Miss! - But what have we done to you? Why do you want to hurt us? - Ask your husband, Miss! - Stop it, damnit. Stop... What do you think? I don't have a copy of the photo? Now you're going to find out who I am. - Why, Arturo? What have we done to deserve this punishment? - See how beautiful you look in the dress I bought you? And now, promise me you won't do anything foolish? You’re going to behave, right? - Yes. Yes, I’ll behave. If you want us to sleep together, I have to be relaxed, don't I? - Put this on, it’s cold outside. - I'm sorry to have to tie you up, but sometimes you're very naughty. Quelqu'un arrive!- Someone is coming! - Shhh. Don’t you dare raise your voice. Don't do anything foolish or you will regret it. You promised. Shhh... Just a second, I’m coming. Shhh... - What are you doing here? Back to your usual nonsense? Look, I think it was perfectly clear the other day that no... - Yes, yes. Sorry. Look, we got off to a bad start the other day. I apologise for disturbing you you and for turning up here so unexpectedly. It’s just... I've been calling you, but it keeps going to voicemail or there's no coverage. I am just begging you to give me another chance, please. And that we finish what we started. - Look, I don't even know how you found me and forgive me, but I just don't feel like talking to you for another second. So... I apologise... - I take full responsibility, but I have the questions written down here. Then you can see them first and tell me whether you like them or not. If you don't like one, we'll skip it and I assure you that this time you will have... - Help! Help! Help! Carmelo! Carmelo, no! Carmelo, please! Help! Carmelo! Carmelo, please! Carmelo... Carmelo! Carmelo! Stop! Carmelo! Carmelo, please... - You stink. You smell rotten. Look, in contrast, this smells nice. Smell it. And you, on the other hand, don't smell good because you've gone out here. Why did you have to leave here? - Carmelo... - I want you to be clean for me. I want you to be... very clean for me. I don't want to see even a single tear! I have already had enough. - Please... - No begging! Not anymore. That poor girl is dead because of you. Why did you have to shout? You're starting to smell clean. That's what it feels like when someone hurts you even though you haven’t done anything to deserve it. Now... there is no escape. Sooner or later they’ll come looking for us and they will pull us apart. Or someone will miss that girl and... then come. But now I get it, we can leave together. Always together. As you once made me swear, Like Romeo and Juliet. Together for eternity. I am going to fix everything. - Julio? Julio! That guy is stupid. - Hello, Elena. - Hello. - Hello. What are you doing here? Is something wrong? - We have to tell you something. - We had wanted to do this for a long time, But we couldn't wait any longer. - You're scaring me. - Elena, your father and Julio tried to intimidate Carmelo. - They tried to beat him up to get something out of him. - And how do you know? - We hired a private detective a month ago. - A private detective? - Yes, to look for any clues to help find your sister. - Why didn't you tell me? - We called you! Your mother didn't tell you anything, did she? - My mother… My poor mother is more out of it than here. OK, so did this detective find out anything? - He even went to Colombia following an Interpol lead, But he confirmed that... it was a dead end. He comes back today. - He told us that everyone is a priori a suspect, you, me, Maria… Your father. - My father? - Ana, What are you suggesting? - Elena, no offence, but we think your father is hiding something. - Of course he is hiding something, from you. - How so? - You in the photos you took with my sister, those that my father found in this house. He hid them from the police so they wouldn’t see them, and to protect your and my sister's privacy. - Now I understand why your father was furious when he saw us. - We really messed up taking those shots. We drank and you know how persuasive Alejandra was. - Yes, but my father was afraid they would be leaked to the press, Family honour above all else. And he kept them. I don't know how that man keeps everything. - Carmelo. Carmelo, please forgive me. Please forgive me. Forgive me... I’m sorry… Now... - I attached the car's exhaust pipe to the room ventilation duct. And so, where life used to come in for my grandfather, now death will come in for us. Relax, it will be painless. Just don't fight it and everything will be fine. We'll fall asleep and that's it. I'm going to start the car. Only a few hours ago, law enforcement officials arrested famous Art History professor and former dean of the University of Seville, Arturo López de Lemos, a renowned figure in religious brotherhoods and a leading candidate to be the official Pregonero of the upcoming Holy Week. He now faces rape charges after being accused by a student. - My God, I know where she is! - Elena, you have to come and see this! - My God, I know where she is! - On TV! - I know where she is! - I know where Alejandra is! Look, you have to see this. Do you see this drawing? Look, what happens when I swipe my finger at it. Alejandra always put fixative when she finished a drawing. This is a golden rule for any professional, But this one... there’s no..., it doesn't have it, do you understand? It is recent, it was done recently. Look, even the colour is much lighter. It was in the folder Carmelo brought me. Look, even the colour is much lighter. It was in the folder Carmelo brought me. Do you know which house this is? It is Carmelo's house in the countryside. Alejandra is alive. That bastard is holding her captive and she's telling us where. Alejandra is alive. That bastard is holding her captive and she's telling us where. - Elena, some shocking news just came on television. - News? What news? - Elena… Elena. No, you listen to me. Her father is currently being questioned. And that does not mean he is guilty. What you are telling me doesn’t make any sense. They’re also trying to divert attention away from her father. I think her family has enough problems as it is. So, take it easy. Come and see me and we'll talk about it. - Well, what did he say? - He didn't even listen to me. He hung up on me, he doesn't believe me. What should we do now? My god, my mother will be all alone. Who knows what might happen to her. I have to go. Ana, get out of the way, we're leaving. - But are you crazy? Where the hell do you think you are going? We are leaving, yes. We are going. But, we're going to that bastard's house. With or without the help of the police or their fucking grannies. We're going there now! Your sister may be in danger. Elena, I believe you. You've been brilliant. Something neither the police nor the private detectives could figure out, You did it. Your mother has to hold on a little longer, Seeing your sister again will breathe life back into her. - Well, that's that. I started up the car. So, in a few minutes, the tube will be filled and the gas will flow into the room. The best thing to do is to relax, as I have already told you. Hey, hey, take it easy. Death, death is not so terrible. We will move on together from one life to another. Don't worry, don't worry, please. I will help you. Shhh... - Come on, come on Julio, pick up. - Do you have any experience? No. Not a lot, not a lot. - Whatever. And you have clothes...? You know... some spandex? - Like, tight and stuff, Yes, yes. I’ve got something. It's yours. -? - Your phone is vibrating. - Yes. It doesn’t matter, I’m unavailable. Where were we? - Julio, where are you? Because I called you three times already. Let’s go to Carmelo's house, the one he has in the countryside. Alejandra is there, I just know it. He is holding her there. Julio, I fear for her life. The police ignored us. For God's sake, where are you! - You know what I mean? This is very unpleasant. I thought it would be different. Hey, look, I have a confession to make. I don't have cancer. No way. It was just a headache that you gave me. And look, I'm thinking, That I still have a lot of things left to experience in life. - Hello? Is anyone there? Carmelo, are you at home? Carmelo! - Nobody is around. - The door was open. - Shhh. I'm listening to something, just a moment. It's a car. A car engine can be heard. - Just what is this? Look! Alejandra… Remove that, remove that. Alejandra is here! Alejandra! -Alejandra, - Alejandra, please. - Alejandra… Breathe with me. Alejandra, Alejandra, please breathe with me. Look at me. Breathe with me, please Alejandra. Breathe... - I am so sorry you are here, especially you, sister-in-law. But, your sister has to learn how hard things can be sometimes. It' s not like that, Alejandra! - No! - I'm so glad to see you! My dear friend. - You’re hurt… - You know I've always been very hard headed. - They have him inside. - Just a moment, please. You can continue. I am sorry I did not listen to you. It was difficult to think of such a possibility at the time. - I don't know, I'm not the professional. I understand the difficulties of your job, but... all I know is that you didn't want to believe me. The simplest thing was to think that my father was guilty. I guess simplicity is not always the right thing to do in your job. - Your father's accuser seems to be unsure about her statement. She contradicts herself, I think it's more an issue of... personal revenge or blackmail. I don't know, but I suspect that your father is not responsible for any rape. - I hope you will get your investigations on the right track this time, Inspector. My family has suffered enough, don't you think? - If you will excuse me... don't worry, I'm fine. Just a bit dizzy and my head hurts a bit. - Ana, you are the heroine of the day. You are my heroine.
