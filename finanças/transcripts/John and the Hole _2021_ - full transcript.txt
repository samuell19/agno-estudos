That was supposed to be a bunker. - A bunker? - Mm-hm. What's a bunker? Sometimes people... They build these underground homes. Why? In case something bad happens. Something bad? Yeah, like a big storm. Like a bunker is a house underneath the earth where you can hide from a big storm. Exactly. They started building it... When was this? - But after a week... - A month. They worked on it for at least a month. I don't think so. There's almost nothing there. No, they worked on it for a month, and then they ran out of money or something. They didn't get their permits approved. How long ago? - Hmm, a few years. - Five, at least. Five, already? My God! They're gonna finish it? I don't know. I'm pretty sure they still own the land.

He asked me what it feels like. When do you stop being a kid? It was... you know, one of those weird questions he comes up with every once in a while. Like when he asked me... why does the water in the pool not feel like real water? Why people are allergic to nuts when nuts are a natural thing. I didn't know what to tell him. I have no idea what it feels like to be an adult. I said something about... responsibilities. I told him you never stop being a kid. That you get older... And grow up, but... You're still a kid inside. A kid with more responsibilities. I don't think he liked that. I think he was... you know, disappointed. [spoon tapping] - What are you doing? - What? What did you just do?

Don't go. Is there anything you need, John? Yes. - What? - Stay. Stay a little while. I don't have much time. Just a little while. Okay. - What do you... - Sit. I'm 13 years old. I know. How old are you? You don't ask that to a lady. - Why not? - You just don't. It's rude. Okay. My mom is 50. I know. We had a big party in this house. I was here. Don't you remember? Are you also 50?

I'm leaving and I'm not coming back. There's money for you in a shoe box under the bed. It should last you ten months, maybe a year, if you don't misuse it. - Can I come with you? - No. Why not? Because you're old enough to be on your own now. I'm 12. - I thought you were 13. - I'm 12. Well... You know Grandma was 15 when she had me. - I never met Grandma. - Here, eat that. You told me we were having chicken. We're not having chicken. There's no time to cook a chicken. I'm leaving soon. - Don't. - I have to. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. They're picking me up, Lily. Who's picking you up? That's none of your business. - Dad? - No. - Stop it! - Take me with you! There is no room in the car! I can ride in the trunk. I can hold my breath for almost a minute. - Okay, promise me something. - What? Promise me you will not quit school. I can go to school wherever you're going. - You promise me. - No! You promise me or I'm taking the money. - Take it, I don't need it. - Yes, you do. - I have the house. - What house? This house. You don't have this house, Lily. Yes I do, and I'm going to sell it. We don't own the house, Lily. We pay rent every month and the money that I've left you is enough so that you can continue to pay rent every month for the next year, if you don't misuse it, as I said. - I'm going to misuse it. - Well... Do whatever you want, it's your money now. - And where will I go? - When? When the money's gone. That's not my problem. This is your life. You get to make your own decisions now. I don't want to make my own decisions. Well, you have to. Okay. Enough. That's enough. You are not gonna stop me from going. I can work for you. - What? - I can do whatever you want. I can be your assistant. You are no assistant, Lily. My daughter is nobody's assistant. You're nobody's assistant, Lily.

These qualies... are tough. Very tough. There are very good players out there. There are kids your age who train every day, every hour, like professionals. You know what I'm saying? Do you? Yes. You know, I had my experience with parents who don't support their children, who don't believe in their potential. And let me tell you, I shouted at them more than once. This is your life, John. This is what you want to do. This could be who you are. I want to. You want to what? I wanna be who I am. Are you gonna ask your mother to send me the checks? Yes. Today? Great. Finish picking up your stuff and get outta here. I need to use the court. [sighing] Did you hear that? Yes. It's like I have a dog inside. A starving dog. [sighing] He has to bring us something today. When was the last time he brought us anything? Two days. Almost two and a half. [sighing] He's trying to kill us. He's gonna let us die here, starve to death. - Don't say that. - Why not? It's the truth. What if something happened to him? What if he never comes back? - Shh! - [Anna] What? No, not you, the dog. I think it's the first time... The first time I've been... hungry. Like really... really hungry. It's about to become... a pain. A new kind of pain. I've never been hungry before. I'm always hungry.
