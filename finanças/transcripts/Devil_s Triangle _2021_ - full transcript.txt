Many years ago, the once great city of Atlantis ruled the planet above. But after countless uprisings and costly wars, King Nereus made a decision to withdraw from the world and disappear from history. We built a paradise under the sea, a world in harmony with all around us. As the outsiders developed more advanced means of transportation, the chances of discovering our underwater kingdom became too great. We spoke to the wind, the sea, and the creatures around us, asking for their protection from those who live on land. Yes, as any parasite that enters our body, we destroyed each and every creature and vessel that ventured too close. But the outsiders could never stay away, leave well enough alone. In secret, they gathered their great forces with one objective: to invade and destroy our kingdom. But no weapons of man are a match for the Hydra, our great protector. Many lives were lost and the outsiders, humiliated, retreated back to land. Yet we know the outsiders will return. They will never be content unless they can own what is not theirs, unless they can destroy all that is good. And for that day, we prepare. I don't like the look of that weather. Planes fly in and out of storms all the time. Come on. You barely got any sleep last night. Just try and get at least a few hours in before we land. Despite you taking out my points on whale migration, algae blooms and sea lion populations, I do know what I'm talking about, and this is a lot of turbulence. I only took out those points 'cause we have yet to verify them yet. We're the first speakers up. We set the tone for the whole conference. We're not published, nor do we have any funding. And they're not gonna give it to us if we don't have anything to present. I know, but it's just... Never mind. Plus, you slept on the couch, so how do you know if I got any sleep last night? Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing rougher than usual turbulence. Please keep your seatbelts on all times. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. We'll be experiencing some moderate turbulence. We ask that everyone remain seated with your seatbelts fastened until we get through this rough patch. Thank you. There's something going on. We'll be fine. Look, Sam has gotten us back home safely, right? Yeah. This is normal, right? Yeah, yeah. This is normal. It's just turbulence. - Excuse me? - Yes? This is normal, right? It's rougher than usual, but we should be fine. See? I'll get you a complimentary drink after this is over, okay? Yes. Thank you. First thing I'm doing when we get there is taking a long drag of this bad boy. Start our honeymoon vacation off right, then head straight to the beach. Mm, sounds perfect. I can't wait. Me either. Did you see that? Remain seated, please. Hey, wait! Are we gonna be okay? - Remain seated... - I'm really scared! - Are we being attacked? - No. Keep your seatbelt on! What is going on? It's just very rough turbulence, madam. Please stay in your seat and keep your seatbelt fastened. Justin. Justin! Justin, wake up! - What? - I saw something. Captain! Captain, can you hear me? Captain, I'm gonna enact the emergency override! Captain! That is not thunder and lightning! Ma'am, please sit down! Hey, sit down and relax and let the flight attendant do her job! Thank you. - Good? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, my God. Ah! Are you okay? - What is happening? - I don't know. - Justin! - Midge! We don't know what's out there! I know there's survivors out there! So I gotta go. Do you see anyone else? Uh... Oh, look! I think there's survivors! Let go of me. My God! There's other survivors! Are you hurt? I think I cut my leg pretty bad. Have you seen anyone else? There was Rose back there. I was with her. There's no one back there! Something has my leg! What? We have to swim! Come on! Please, help me! Help me! Del! Ah! Oh, my God! Owen! Owen! Come on, get up! Help! Someone help! - Help! - I'm coming! Help! Help! It's my husband! Please, help! Okay, it's all right. We're gonna pull him up here together, okay? We can do it. We can do it! On three, we're gonna pull him. Right here, right here! Grab him right here! One, two, three... Okay, again! We can do this. Are you ready? One, two, three... Okay, okay. Hey, you need to shade his face so that he doesn't get heatstroke, okay? - Here. - Okay. Here. Look what he did to his hands. Hey, I'm gonna go look for my husband. You gonna be okay? - Okay. - Okay. I'll be right back. - Baby, you're going to make it. - Del? It's okay. Come on, wake up. Del! Del! Vera! - Del? - I'm here. - Baby! - Vera! - Del! - Vera, Vera! - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good. Okay, baby, I got you. I'm gonna get you out, okay? Hey, hey, I need your help! - I'm stuck under the chairs. - Please. Sorry, sweetie. Okay. Oh, God! Hey. What's your name? Ruth. My name is Vera. This is my husband, Del. I'm gonna need your help, okay? We need to lift this off him, okay? We're gonna pull it off, okay? Wait, wait! You're bleeding. - It's okay. - Really badly. It's okay, it's okay. You ready? Go! Pull! It's not working! Hey... are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Oh, baby... Are you okay? Oh, my God! It's fine. It's fine. Is he okay? Oh, my God. Oh! - We're gonna be okay. - Yes, yes, yes. I just... I gotta find Ruth. Baby, I'm right here, I'm right here. I gotta find her. - I'm right here, come on. - I just... I just gotta find... I can't find... Come on. Look, baby. We made it to the beach. Yeah. I can't find... Is there anyone else? Um... I don't know. Um... I saw a survivor but... they didn't make it. But we should patrol the beach for others. What we can do is we'll find some sticks and we'll make a signal fire. And we can find some rocks and we'll make a visible message. Remember, it'll be just like our expedition off the coast of Nova Scotia. That's right. We were stranded in the dead of winter and we were surrounded by ice. And we made it out okay. But we're in the middle of the ocean. The closest civilization is... God knows how far! It's okay. We're marine biologists. We spend most of our lives on the ocean. Our chances of survival are good. Based on our flight trajectory, that puts us somewhere around... The Devil's Triangle. That's not good. Also known as the Bermuda Triangle. Oh, that's not good. It's okay. It's just a myth. It's okay. We're in the Sargasso Sea. Sargasso Sea? It's roughly between Bermuda and the Floridian Coast. It's a well-studied and traveled route. Yeah. Signaling a passing ship is gonna be our best bet. I don't see anybody. It's early in the day, so just... Ah! - Where are we? - Relax, relax. - Where are we? - We're friends, relax! - Who are you? - We're friends! We're friends! He's still in shock! - Oh, my God! - Probably still in shock. Oh, no! Oh, no! Come here, come here. You two, stay with him! I'm gonna go search the beach for survivors! No, Vera! Not in your condition! I'm fine, I'm fine! It's okay. - They need you more than I do! - No! I don't want you going out and putting yourself in harm's... I don't need your help right now, okay? Trust me! I will be right back. 30 minutes, okay? 30 minutes! If you're not back in 30 minutes, I'm coming to look for you. Deal? Okay. I will check the shoreline and I will check the rocks. And I will be back in 30 minutes, okay? Okay, and if you guys feel up to it, look for some fresh water and food, okay? I'll be right back. Oh, my God. - Are you okay? - Midge! Justin! - Hey, hey. - Who are you? Who are you? - You're safe. - Where are we? You're safe. - The plane! - It crashed, it crashed. The Triangle, but it's bad luck! We're on an island in the Sargasso Sea. What? The captain and I, we saw it on navigation, the Devil's Triangle. It's really important that you tell me if you or the captain sent out any sort of signal, - some sort of distress signal. - No. - Does anybody know we're here? - No. No, no, no. We tried, but we couldn't before the missiles hit us. Yeah, we saw them from our window, too. I guess someone really doesn't want us flying over their ocean. Hey, you're gonna need medical attention. I know, I know. What's your name? - I'm Vera. - I'm Sam. Here. Come on. It'll be safer with the others. - Okay? - The others? Is there a blonde woman, a woman with short blonde hair? And she's about 5'5. She would have been with my brother, Justin. He's wearing a black shirt. I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay, come on. Oh, my God! Watch out! - Go! Save yourselves! - Hey, who are you? Get away from this island! You made a mistake! Run! Run! Run! Oh! Oh! Oh! Vera! No! Ah! You trespass over our sacred land! No, please! This is just a misunderstanding! Ah! No! No! Silence! Oh, my God! By order of the King, your punishment for fleeing is death by Hydra. Please, I will no longer flee. Please, please don't expose me to the Hydra! I'm a good worker! I'm sorry to the King... You risked exposing our world! No! I'm sorry to the King and my people. Please! Please! Get her up! No! No! No! No! No! Stop! What are you doing to her? Oh, God! You offend our gods and pollute our shores! We'd happily leave your land, but we don't know how. You shot us down! It's you! She needs medical attention! Please! Achilles. Take this one back to command. Take this one prisoner. Cadmus, join me on the bridge. We have new orders from the palace. Achilles, take the new prisoners to the medical bay until arrival. The God King will want them presentable before trial. What? A God King, what is that? Move. Vera! Oh, my God, what happened to her? Hey! What'd you do to my wife? Quiet! Oh, what is that? Silence. No, no. You'll be okay. And what is this? Why is he in here? He's in the healing capsule. His wounds are much worse than yours. He'll be okay. It's an Synechocochus Elongotus. What? What is it? Blue-green algae. It's not typically blue-green. It's usually a dark green... Maybe it's a hybrid with some sort of toxin. You need to get it off me. It's making me... It's a natural anesthetic, a pain killer. But it'll... it'll make us very... very drowsy. Ruth? Ruth? I'm not... I'm not gonna let them kill us! Just... Please... Let us go! Please... Please... Let us go. Pseudoliparis Swirei? Hey, you're awake. Those are rare snailfish only found at depths of 26,000 feet. So what? That puts us like 5,000 feet shy of the depth of the Marianas Trench in what appears to be a World War II era sub. Where are they taking us? I don't know. But for some reason, they want to keep us alive, apparently. Hey, I was so worried about you. You lost so much blood, I thought I was gonna lose you. Honestly, I feel fine. I feel completely healed. Yeah, me too. I've never seen anything like this. The healing properties alone go against any existing science we know. Yeah, but why? Why do they want to keep us alive? I don't know. No, no! Where are you? What happened to her? She had a brother and sister on the flight and I don't think they made it. Where are we? Where are we? Relax. We don't know exactly, but we're on a submarine deep under water. Prisoners must remain silent! Where are you taking us? You will soon see: a place as majestic and beautiful as Olympus. And that place would be? Atlantis. Del? Yeah, I'm seeing it. Please. Please, I'll do anything. Please, just let us go. - Hey! - Keep quiet! Attacking innocent civilians? Is that the kind of people you are? - Vera, don't! - Oh! - Hey! Leave her alone! - Move! Or the next hit of my spear will be across your brow! Punishment is swift and cruel for the uncivilized. Now move! This one's good. Go. Go. Go. You look familiar. Keep moving! And you would be correct. Bring the outsiders forward. The God King and his household thank you for your service. We do not take kindly to intruders in the Atlantean territory. You shall not dare turn your backs upon His Highness at any time for it's an affront to the gods. And, therefore, an affront to our King. You will be fed to the Hydra in the grand harbor where he sleeps beneath our tower of light, as is our custom. And what if we don't give a damn about your custom? Silence! Know your place in a house of royalty. Mainlanders... you stand accused of crimes against the deep. Such vile offenses include: trespassing, destruction of precious resources and property, resisting arrest and, worst of all, an attempt to harm the only one of its kind: the Hydra. You now stand in the presence of Nereus the Second, descendant of Poseidon, Commander of the Seven Seas, the God King of Atlantis! You people look most changed since the last time your kind has come this way. More... discomposed and haggard. Well, be you so uneducated that summoning a response is strenuous? Speak, I say. I guess we will cut to the heart of the matter. How do you all plead for your crimes? Speak! Not guilty! We're not guilty! We were not intending to... You will address his highness as "My Lord", "My King", "Your Eminence", or "Lord Supreme". Unless, you wish to be fed to the Hydra. Okay. Yes, My... My King. So you plead not guilty. I'm curious. Who do you think should bear the brunt of the responsibility of the crimes at your feet? I do. It's my fault. Sam, what are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed. Our airplane was attacked in the night. I assume one of your people had a hand in it. We protect our people and our lands from vile humans as we see fit. I'm a pilot. It's my fault our plane crashed into your land. That is not true! Your missiles hit our plane! Dozens are dead because of you! You are the guilty one! Silence! Proceed. I implore you to see our side and take mercy on us. We don't mean you or your people any harm. Spare my friends. Send them back to the mainland safely. Take me, punish me. I have nothing else to lose. You say you're a pilot. Yes. Former military for the American forces. And you can command all kinds of craft, yes? Yes, a wide range. Oh, my friends, my friends! Please forgive a king his theatrics. It's so rare that we have people who do not wish ill will to my fine city. Erastos, remove these shackles at once! Sire, I must advise against this. Must I repeat myself? These are not our prisoners. They are our guests. Move. Cadmus? How fortunate it is that you found us in such dire circumstances. I hope my scouts have not rattled you beyond repair. Nothing beyond a few bruised egos. And humorous, too! We will make a court jester of you yet. And what manner of personage are you two? Oh... um... uh... This is Ruth, my wife. - Hi. - And I'm Owen... Owen Dubois. It's French. They are fools. Please, forgive my advisor. He has the biting wit of an eel. Wait. Forgive me for the question, Your Highness. But how do you all speak English? If the rumors are true, it's been a millennia since Atlantis sank. You should all be speaking some sort of Phoenician. Well, you are not the first of your kind to pass this way. We have collected many things over the past century to better understand a potential enemy. I thought you just called us your friends. You're right. You are not our enemies. Now, come! You must be weary. We will make bedchambers for your stay. No, no, no. We can't stay. We need to get back to the mainland immediately. Nonsense! No one turns down an invitation from the King. Guards, please show our guests to their chambers. Well, when in Atlantis. Atlantis. Who would have thought the legends are true? Hey, could you... - Yeah. I got you. - Thanks. Yeah. I don't know. Something just still feels off about it. Look, the King won't let us leave. I know, but we need to make them feel at ease with us if we want to keep those chains off us. If we want to survive here, we've got to... We got to play nice. Exactly. Big smiles, best behavior. And in the meantime, we make a plan to escape. We're gonna need weapons to get past the guards. And we're gonna need a craft to get to the surface. I saw one in the harbor, but I have no idea how we're gonna get it with the Hydra guarding it. So let's gather some intel and we'll make a plan tonight. And I want to talk to that vendor from the market. He looked so familiar. Yeah. I was gonna say the same thing. It's like... I recognize his face from books or articles or like really old photographs, like black and white ones. Same. Let's see if we can find him later. Deal. Hey, and I know we've been fighting lately. And I know we haven't been working well together. But we need to work together now. You with me? I'm with you 100%. We're gonna get outta here together. Okay. You ready? I'm ready. Let's go. Midge, are you okay? Yeah. Oh, where are we? Midge, I think we're the only ones that survived. I know. Sam! I can't believe she's gone! She really tried, Midge. God, I'm never flying again. I'll never be in a cockpit again. Okay. All right. We have to figure out where we are so we can get outta here. Well, it looks like there's footsteps. So maybe someone's been here before? Okay. All right, let's follow it. Come on. Get down, get down, get down! She looks military. Maybe she'll help us. I do not want to deal with her. Should we go around? Yeah. - Don't let her see you. - Okay. - Stay low. - All right. Keep down. One more step and I'll slice your throats. Who are you? That is none of your concern, mainlander! Look, please, our plane crashed and... Silence! Do you not think we already know this? Who do you think shot your plane down? Why? What did we ever do to you? Your people. You pollute our lands, you destroy our oceans! We will rise again. Until then, our King will be very pleased we have more survivors. Come with me! You'll die for this! Justin, what did you do? I... I don't know. Is she dead? I don't know, Midge! She's not alone! Others are gonna come looking for her! We gotta go! We gotta go! Okay! May I have your attention, please? The King sends his regards, but he will not be joining us. He's tending to an urgent matter with Archimedes. Your city is beautiful. I'm particularly interested in the lighting. It's powered by some form of bioluminescent algae, correct? Well, you must be well-learned. My husband and I have dedicated our lives to the study of the ocean. Marine biology, as our people call it. Well, Atlanteans value the scientific mind above all else. And we wish to make certain that you all receive a tour of our fine kingdom. Uh, we wish to stay here, Your Highness. Is my hospitality not good enough for you? No. We would just rather wait for Sam so we may celebrate the good fortune with the King of Atlantis together. You're all new to the city, so I'm only going to say this once. You would be wise not to turn down an offer from the King. I meant no disrespect. Yeah. It would be an honor to take a tour of your scientific facilities. And you two, our guards have just informed us that you've both been wed. Yeah. We were on our way to our honeymoon when our plane crashed. Well, Atlantis boasts of many sights and secrets of the ancient world, a fine and beautiful place for a honeymoon. The guards, of course, will show you anywhere you wish to go within the confines of the kingdom. Thank you. Go into the marketplace. Pick out something nice, anything you like. The King will insist that you have a proper wedding gift. Thank you. When we're alone, we need to make a plan. Welcome to our very own pearl of the deep, Atlantean Science. All of our greatest minds have passed through these hallowed halls at one time or another. Del, look at this. That's the beach we crashed on. This is our defense map. - Defense map? - Yes. We've programmed a minefield of cutting edge weaponry to safeguard our borders, but only used when absolutely necessary. This is our chief scientist, Archimedes, a prodigy among our collection of great minds. I'll leave you in her able hands. And what are these hexagons along the cumulonimbus? Wind bombs. From this table, my team and I have the ability to manipulate the elements of the triangle. With the hexagons, we pump the air full of enhanced substances that act as ice nuclei, which help to alter the formations of clouds from the microphysical level. So it's cloud seeding. Precisely. It forces the... Forces the flow of precipitation. It's not my area of expertise, but I know enough about it to know that the science is somewhat debatable. I guess not anymore. Yes. And luckily for my team and I, the weather in the region does the rest of the work for us turning these altered clouds into small hurricanes which appear as the hexagons you see before you. Over the years, we've had to protect our city, keeping it hidden from the world above. We exist in seclusion far away, no threat to you at all. Yet even after you outsiders failed to penetrate our world, you tried and tried again. Then finally, the day came when your science could take you deep below the surface, closer to us than ever before. It was the first time in many years that we felt fear. In secret, you came. You sent a submarine vessel to spy upon our city. Once again, our sisters and brothers of the sea protected us, ensuring that the outsiders would never return to tell of what they had seen. Though it would end in disaster for your kind. We knew Atlantis would never be the same. We would now have to learn of your science, learn of your means of invasion and your means of destruction. And we pray that it does not make us what you are. Perhaps you'll find this next wonder of ours a bit more interesting. Come. This room houses the main power source for our entire civilization, our light and machines, the simulations of night and day, sun, moon and stars, powered by a rare form of ocean floor algae with which my team has been able to communicate. Communicate? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you trying to tell us that this wall is sentient? Correct. I've heard of some biochemical reactions among undersea plant life. But nothing that resembles an intelligible language. That is merely the beginning. They have a rich language they speak with to one another. All we had to simply do was learn it. They are so highly reactive. Their bioelectric communication can connect with our neurology through touch. Isn't it beautiful? They provide us with many resources: bioelectric energy, bioluminescence, bioelectric weapons, as you've no doubt experienced first-hand while here in Atlantis. Like the spears. Yes, the spears. Even the Hydra responds to the algae. Without it, we would be at its mercy. That is amazing. The King will be most pleased to hear of your approval, and Archimedes is yours. Perhaps one day we may work together to bridge our peoples through a higher understanding and advanced drive. Maybe... one day. Yes, yes. Thank you. It's obvious that there is much here that we don't understand. Come. There are many more sights to see. Aren't you coming? No, not at this time. But please, this is all for you. Proceed. Oh, now, would you look at that? I'll give you 15 American coins for the gold necklace. Try again, my friend. Come on. Fifteen rare coins? The necklace has gotta be worth that. Do you think the value of gold is worth the loss of your backside? Fifty. Fifty? Um... just one second. I wanted to get you a solid gold necklace. You didn't have to use your own money. The King said he wanted to get us a wedding gift. I just... I wanted to get you something nice. Honey, I would love a gold necklace. I would love to lay on the beaches here, to dine in the gorgeous palaces, to live like... like a queen for the rest of my life. And we can. Forget that we were in a plane crash, right? We are friends of the King. We can live like that for the rest of our lives if we stay here. Owen, this isn't our home. We have lives up there. And jobs... and debt? And friends and family? We need to find Del and Vera. They know the ocean. They can help us get out of here and maybe we can help them. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah, you're right. As much as I don't wanna leave this place, we have to. And finding them will help. I promise we, you and I, will get back home. Okay. Let's go. - It's cold. - I know. Search them. What is it? Do you hear something? No. Could have sworn I heard something. Hello? Who's out there? Show yourselves! Look out! - Run, Justin! - Midge! Let go of me! Justin! Back off! I'm warning you! Run, Justin! I'm warning you! Shh, shh. Don't move or I will kill you. - Midge! - Pitiful! No more threats from you, weak mainlander! It was all my fault. I could have done something... anything when I had the chance. I could have saved everyone, including my brother and sister. I failed. You say your craft spun out of control, a terrible accident caused by our more aggressive defenses. You are not the genius of such tragedy. And I give you my humblest apologies for the misfortunes that we have brought upon you. No. That's okay. It's not your fault. You were just protecting your people, which is what I should have been doing while I had the chance. I had hundreds of people's lives in my hands. I failed. The worst part is, is I don't even know what happened to Midge and Justin. Who? My family. Ah, you seek closure, as do we all after a brush with Hades. You know, I used to think about settling down someday, raising a family, growing old somewhere green and beautiful. But I don't know, I guess after serving in the military so long, something changed. Seeing all that violence, war, hate, I mean, what kind of person would I be to raise children in a world like this, you know? That's when I became completely dependent on my siblings. They mean everything to me. Sorry. I don't know why I'm unloading on you. What does a king care about the misfortunes of a pilot? On the contrary, as King, it's my sacred duty to safeguard the happiness of all my people. I may not be able to bring the dead back to life. But perhaps I can give you something to lift your spirits. Come with me. I want to show you something. Look at that! An impressive sight, is it not? Yeah, you could say that. I suspect that this would be a gift best suitable for someone like you, a military woman. You say you can command all kinds of craft, yes? Well, yeah. I mean, I have friends in all branches of the military. And they certainly taught me things. But I'm only trained to fly planes. Well, we have collected it all, the jewels of a lost world repurposed for an Atlantean fleet. I can see why this place is a paradise. It's beautiful. Yes, a paradise, far from your troubles and experiences from the mainland. But as all things that have life, this great paradise has an expiration date. What do you mean? Atlantis is dying, Samantha. It's already begun. We are but 1% of what we used to be. I don't understand. I did not want to trouble you or your friends. But as the oceans are beginning to be crippled more and more each day and Mother Earth being drained of her natural resources, our brightest minds have already predicted an imminent doomsday. Doomsday? From climate change? I'm afraid this way of life that my family has safeguarded for so many centuries is on the verge of collapse, Samantha. The ocean is a delicate ecosystem, something that your mainland destruction is quickly tipping into murkier waters. After the oceans fall, thereafter so will Atlantis. And your surface world will not survive much longer after that. As the air is heated, so is the ocean. The great shift will stop the currents. The marine life will perish. Ecosystems on land that are connected to the ocean will collapse and your cities will flood. No! Our governments have been making this fight a top priority. Climate change affects all of us. We have hosted a handful of humans in the past, Samantha, in secret. They do not listen. Your governments are lying to you. No. Or simply they do not understand the destruction they are causing. No, you're wrong! You have to be wrong! There's got to be something we can do! Maybe your tech can do something, something to stop this or I can! I'll do anything I can to help! We have to record this, all of it. Any information we find could help us escape. Turn the flash off! My phone! That vile thing blinded me, you mainland scum! Get away from me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, cool down, all right? I know you're a black belt in Hapkido and can kick ass now that you're finally healed. But we have to keep a low profile. I'm just get the phone, okay? I'm just gonna get the phone. I'm just gonna get the phone. Just getting the phone. All right, stand down, stand down, stand down. I'm sure the mainlanders meant no harm. I think we all can agree we don't need any broken bones today. Thank you. We have to maintain ourselves on this island, not at the cost of our dignity! You understand that? Yes, sir. Of course. - You? - Yes. Thank you. I'm Ruth. I am called Pluto. That's right! We were talking earlier about the necklaces. You said your name is, um, Pluto? I just said it. You didn't hear me? No, I got it. I am named after the gods who released the Hounds of Hell. So you understand you have to maintain dignity here. Go. Yes, sir. Thank you, Pluto, thank you. Hey, that guy back there, I know this sounds crazy. But I think he's a famous admiral from World War II. What? What are you talking about? Listen to me. So my grandfather, he used to tell me all these stories of his time in the military and show me photos. And that guy was in the pictures. I just... I just can't remember his name. Well, he said his name was Pluto. I heard him, but, look, I don't think he's an Atlantean. Didn't you hear the way he talked to those guards? Okay. Well, what? You wanna go talk to him? No, no. Let's get the others and then we'll come back. Well, wait. Why don't we get the necklace? You're so bad! Dropped my phone again. Damn it! The screen is completely cracked. Owen, look at this. Owen? What are you doing? Shh! Keep your voice down. My forces are willing and ready to assist you in all the things you may need to undertake this mission. What's the King doing with Sam? Wait. Let me get this straight. You want me to captain one of those, your updated World War II Allied sub? And deliver our best chances of survival, yes. I would not ask you this if it was not absolutely critical. This has the potential of saving all mankind and saving the planet, Samantha. Well, why not ask one of your own commanders to do it? Why do you need me? I believe you can agree that your governments are a little hostile to outsiders. Once they see us coming, they're naturally going to feel we are invaders. And they're gonna blow us from the water. This responsibility is best suited for one of their own. And, besides, my sentries cannot survive above the surface for too long due to their life living under the surface. But what is this thing that'll save the planet from climate change? It is our most ambitious technological achievement yet. It has the ability to repair the ice caps, to dilute the pollution from your cities and machines, heal nature from the ground up. You will be a hero not only to your peers, but in the history books. People from all different creeds and color will know you. I don't think I can do that, Your Highness. I only just today found out that Atlantis is real, that all of this is real. And now you're expecting me to believe that the world is going to end? You're right. I'm sorry. This is such a colossal weight to carry. I should not have burdened you with such a heavy cargo and so soon after losing loved ones. I'm sorry. I understand if you cannot undertake such a heroic effort. Wait. How does this thing work, the device? My scientists will brief you on the details later. But it is absolutely essential that it's activated on dry land. If I do this, if I take on this mission, if I helm your sub, I humbly ask for just one favor in return. Name your price, your heart's desire. My family. I know you may not be able to bring the dead back to life. But what if they're still out there just drifting aimlessly? I need to know if they're alive... Or, you know. I ask that you send your scouts to search for them. And if they don't find anything, then I'll know. You are a fierce one for the ones you love. Consider the bargain set. I will send my forces immediately. Thank you. You're welcome. You must be tired. Return to your chambers. We launch at dawn. Did the mainlander prove useful? Quite useful. Now go. Make the necessary changes to the command sub so we launch at dawn. Is the weapon ready for deployment? Weapon? Yes, My King, as requested. Archimedes and her team have integrated the nuclear bomb's core with the crystallized algae. This will increase the destructive fallout 100-fold. Hmm. Good, good. Yes, summon me to the harbor once all has been made ready. I wish to see the bomb loaded myself. Now go. We have to get to the others and warn them. Come on. Come on, it's okay. I'm kinda scared. Ruth, run! Run, go, I'm right behind you! - Get the others! - Stop! It'll slow 'em down. Show me what you got, merman. Is that all you got? You don't want this. Aah! No! There she is! And up ahead is our advanced weapons foundry. It's here we take the sunken remains of your wars and upgrade them into refined offensive accessories. This technology is unprecedented. Is your ammunition similar to the artillery we use? Yes. Well, with the exception of the biological spears. The spears are tipped with crystallized algae that charge electromagnetically with our power grid. Other weapons such as this grenade contain concentrated crystallized bioluminescent algae, much more powerful than your explosives and completely separate from our power grid. That's the weaponized mineral that you mentioned earlier. Yes. Its unique properties reinforce the casing, propel the projectile further, explode with greater force... But I thought you said the algae was sentient. We do what we must to protect our city. I assume it's very volatile. It merely requires an ignition source. And yet you rely on the enforcement of an undersea creature, the Hydra? Right. Where is the Hydra right now? Just out in open water? Like where we first saw it when we were on the island? No. The Hydra's in its guard post where we feed it and tend to it. We only send it to the open ocean if we feel the borders of our city need protecting. May I? Of course. It's truly remarkable how streamlined your defenses are. Elegant. Imagine with these findings what we could publish for our work, not to mention all the people that we could help back home. There you go again. V... Talking about publishing before helping people. Del is right. One must make sure one can trust the findings, correct? Of course. You know, I've been meaning to... - Ruth! What's... - Shh, shh! They cannot know that I'm here. - What's wrong? - Who can't know you're here? Where's Owen? They killed him. What? The King. He fed him to that monster in the harbor, the Hydra. They murdered him. No more playing nice. Right. We gotta get out of here right now. - Yeah, yeah! - Wait, wait, wait. We cannot go without Sam! Where is she? We have to get to her before they... - Before what? - The King. He has her wrapped around his little finger. She is gonna captain a submarine to the coast and nuke the mainland. No! She thinks she's gonna save the world, something about ending climate change. We have to find her. Well, what about the chambers, where they brought us when we first got here? Yes, yes, let's go. Come on. Someone's coming! Someone's coming! - Hide, hide, hide! - This way. We need to find them. With their knowledge and our tech, Atlantis will be unstoppable. I told the King not to trust those mainlanders. Wait! Take this. Make yourself useful? Hello. Vera, Vera, wait! What are you doing? How did you know to stab that into the control panel? Archimedes said it charges electromagnetically. So any forceful impact between an electromagnet and a conductor will cause a pulse. I thought you were a marine biologist. I minored in electrical engineering. It's good to have options. Archimedes also said that the algae is highly reactive. Is there anything on him? Anything we can use? No. No keys, no weapons, nothing. Can we just steal a submarine to get out of this place? That's the plan and, if we can find some weapons, even better. Archimedes showed us how to work the city's power source. If we can get back to the main generator, I can try and shut down the power and we can use that time to steal a submarine. Hey, Ruth, if we run into some trouble, do you think you can take them down? Yeah they're pretty tough, but if we take out their tech, I got this. Let's go. Come on. No, no, no! Don't touch it. It'll still be charged. Come on. The coast is clear. Let's go. In here! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, the generator should be just up ahead. Halt! You two, keep going! Watch out! No! Are you okay? We gotta go! Okay, um... Okay, we'll secure the room while you take care of the generator. Okay. Vera, are you sure about this? No. I don't want you getting hurt. I'm not sure, but what's the job of a scientist if not to jump into the unknown for the betterment of the planet? Absolutely. I mean, if the spears are connected to the algae power grid, if we knock it out, then it should at least disable them... momentarily. My thoughts exactly, and I believe you. Believe me about what? That you weren't just interested in getting your work published. Oh, damn it! Someone's coming! Yeah, I know. Vera? Vera? They're coming! We need to hide! Come on! Are they here? They must have heard us coming. How could you let them out of your sight? The King will be most displeased with your performance, Archimedes. Of the two of us, whom was bettered by the outsiders? I'm certain I don't know what you mean. Your incompetence seems to say otherwise. - Don't condescend me! - Enough! I want guards posted on every major passageway! We can't let them escape! What they could do with that information... Okay, we don't have much time. Ruth is right, this whole place is gonna be crawling with guards soon. I know, I know. Archimedes said the algae's bioelectric communication interacts with our neurology. So I just need it to feel what I want it to do just as much as I need to verbalize it. Let's distract Atlantis. Come on. I mean you and the ocean no harm. Shut everything down. Shut everything down! Come on! The King has been notified. Now we will regroup with the rest of the team. We will find these mainlanders and... Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam? It's Vera. - Where is she? - She should be here. I thought you said she came back to her chambers. She did. Do you think something happened to her? I don't know. Well, we gotta move. She's gotta be somewhere. Let's go. I hope you three are enjoying your escapade. Well, my forces and I don't take too kindly to you shutting down our power. I don't think your friends of Atlantis after all. You people are murderers. Filthy, disgusting monsters! Is it true? You guys are planning on dropping a nuclear bomb on North America and triggering a worldwide flood? We do what we must for the preservation of our people. So that's how you justify killing billions of innocent people? We're providing a mercy for the planet. You're the ones polluting the oceans! We're merely providing a solution. You're sick. Enough. Lock them away in the dungeons. Archimedes! I bring news from the surface. The King wishes to see us at once. Go. Preparations are almost complete, My King. My team and I have made some last-minute upgrades to the weapon as specified. Its destructive power should now encompass all of the enemy's coastline, leaving us a sizeable part of the west to salvage and conquer at a later time. Good. Once again, you make me proud, Archimedes. Atlantis owes you a debt of gratitude. You honor me and my house. Your Majesty, the pilot, as requested. Samantha, I trust you are rested and refreshed. Relatively. What a day we have ahead of us. I hope you're prepared. Isn't it magnificent? I've had my scientists fitting your craft all night long for your daring adventure. Are you not amazed by the sights around us? I'd prefer to find out what exactly that is. It's merely a precautionary measure. I know a nuke when I see one. I do not seek to pull the wool over your eyes, Samantha. The warhead is merely the submarine's arsenal, particularly decorative. Funny, calling a weapon of mass destruction decorative. Do I detect a tone of suspicion in your voice? Well, I find it hard to believe that a peaceful planet-saving mission requires such destructive cargo unless forcing hostility on mainland was your intention all along. These assumed delusions do not sit well on your brow, Samantha. Now come. Let me show you the upgraded features to the bridge. I know what you're planning, whether you're willing to admit or not. And I'm letting you have a chance before you have the blood of millions on your hands. Erastos, bring me the prisoner. With pleasure, sire. Come on! Come on! Just a little bit more. Come on, come on. Oh, stupid thing! - V? - Oh, good. You're awake. How long was I out for? I don't know, an hour or so. You can thank her snake of an advisor for that. How's Ruth doing? She's, um... she's still processing. Just... Just leave her be for now. - Okay? Okay. - Yeah. Yeah, thank you. If I could just get the right sequence or feeling... it's... it's hard to explain. You won't get out of here that way. Why did they arrest you? I was looking for you at the palace. They didn't like that. How did you end up in Atlantis? We'd lost our way. We were trying to outmaneuver a Nazi submarine. We were following orders. We were diving through the region when we got lost in the triangle. Suddenly everything went black. Everything went dark. Those who were able to get out of the sub first were eaten by the sharks. There were hundreds waiting for us. Only a few of us were able to make it to the shore. My righthand man, Horn, and I jumped together. I almost didn't make it to shore. A shark came for me but Horn saw it first. He got in the way. I tried to save him. I will never forget the screams. I blacked out for a long period of time. I don't know exactly how long. The Atlanteans, they kept me alive. Now I know why. They wanted military information, tactics about what we're doing while we're there. I lost a lot of my memory when I was there, but they fed me algae, something to make me remember my past. But they misdirected me. They thought I was a petty officer, not a commander. And that's why they never asked you to pilot their world-destroying craft. But a lot of my memory did come back. It was all a lie, the way they treated you, the way they treated me. They will pay for it. I'm gonna help you get out of here. And I'm coming with you. Deal! - Sam! - Midge! Oh, my God, I thought I lost you! I thought I lost you too! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Where's Justin? Where is he? Is he okay? Midge? Midge, where's Justin? That's enough for now. Erastos! Erastos, take the prisoner away. No! No! Bring her back! Bring her back right now! I've upheld my end of the bargain, a lovely family reunited once again. What did you do to my brother? The boy was hurt. So I guess you're now using Midge to keep me in line, huh? Is that it? I knew I liked you above your friends the moment you stepped foot into the palace. You keep up considerably well. And if I refuse? I advise you not to find out what resides on the other side of that thought. The sub leaves in one hour with you commanding it. If you want your sister to live, I advise you do not test me any further. So we can't go back to the power room since that'll be secured by now. So Plan A is a no-go. Okay. So Plan B. Plan B is we use as much of their tech against them as possible. And we break into the weapons room and we use their weapons to get to the sub in the harbor. The admiral can pilot us out of here with Sam's help. Shh! Someone's coming. Last meal! What do you mean, last meal? Well, you guys are scheduled to be executed within the hour. Death by Hydra, I assume. - Shut your mouth. - You'll be joining them. Hey... She's out cold. Barely! Ruth... It's for Owen. These people need to pay for what they did. - Let's go. - Yeah. Okay, this is it. Grab whatever you want. They must be at the sub. Pluto? Think that suits you. A hammer. That's a good choice. They used to call me that back in the academy. But we're gonna have to hit 'em with something harder than that. All right. That works. All right, let's get outta here! My Lord, there's been a breach in the dungeons. And I've been alerted of an explosion in the weapons vault. Dispatch the guards to safeguard the entrance to the harbor. I do not want anyone to interfere with this launch. Yes, My King. My children! Standing before you is our champion. She shall go forth on our behalf to help usher in a new era of prosperity and power for all Atlantean folk. A glorious age when my kingdom once again shall rule over all mankind, an age free from the cruel grip of destructive governments. May the gods on high Olympus watch over us and keep our endeavors forever in their minds. Sam! Whatever they're forcing you to do, don't! They're just gonna kill me anyway! It doesn't have to be like this. You can still call it off. Please take our good captain to the command bridge. Where is everybody? There they are. Shoot the prisoners! Don't let them pin us down! We'll die if we stay here! It is a shame finding ourselves on opposite sides of the board. I thought we would be comrades of learning. Do it! Ah! Keep moving! Push them back! We can't let them breach the harbor! We must keep fighting! Is there another way back to the harbor? Pluto, are you all right? You three, you get ready to run. Wait, what? What are you talking about? No! Go, go! Let them go. Prison rats. Let's see what strength you have, mainlander. Show me. Let me see you embarrass yourself. I won't do it! I refuse to be a part of your heinous plan! What a waste. Kill the girl! - Sam! - No! Stop! Leave them alone! Midge! Atlanteans! Do your city proud! Remove these outsiders from my sight! Highest marks to you. I did not think you could keep up with an Atlantean. It's all talk. Show me something! All right, I'll honor you with a swift death! Catch! You should have stayed away from me! V, we've got company! Lay down here. Uh... uh... Stay with me, Midge! I'm not going to lose you again! - That stuff feels good. - Yeah? Okay, good. Grab the vest. Yeah. Good call. Sam! Ah! Sam! Sam! You will take this sub to its final destination! Guards, take her! Come on. Back off! Vera. Drop the weapons. Now! Do me a favor... give my regards to Hades. - Sam! - Run! Stupid girl! You will not stop me. Many have tried. You are merely just a name on a long failed list. Stop or burn! This is for you, Owen. You disappoint me, Sam. You had so much potential. Sam, look at this. Midge! Pluto? No... No! No! No! No! Go sit there. Just take it easy. I don't understand. How am I alive? - Sam, are you okay? - Oh, my God. These are my friends, and this is... Out here, they call me Pluto. I was an admiral in World War II. All right! Everybody strap yourselves in! Are you ready and prepared to launch? Yes, sir. We're gonna get out of here. Full throttle! Fools! No! No! I'm your King! No! Man the torpedoes! We need to be clear of the city! We're clear of the dome! Ready... Now! Hang on to something! - We're not gonna make it! - Just hang on! - I love you, V. - I love you too. Everyone okay? We all okay? Yeah. You are never flying me anywhere again. I love you too. I never saw anything so beautiful. Thank all of you. Thank you.
