(audience cheering) Mr. Chuck Wells from California handed up $200,000 as the Mr. Rossi's group made it a winner-take-all pot of $400,000 dollars. (audience cheering) (bell ringing) (audience applauding) California has won the first fight, looks like an extremely strong team from California. (audience applauding and cheering) We see Mr. Wells at ringside looking at bit determined, but now he seems to be checking the scoreboard. (bell ringing) (crowd cheering) (boxers grunting) (audience cheering) Mr. Wells looking restless and slightly worried about his fight. (audience cheering) (boxers grunting) (audience cheering) (bell ringing) The local team is starting to fight back. They've won this fight. But given up with the California kid. - I don't know, something's gone wrong here. - [Radio Announcer] Mr. Rossi now looks a bit (bell ringing) more sure of his investment. (audience cheering) (boxers grunting) (audience whistling) (audience cheering) - [Coach] One minute, you got one minute! He's got one minute! - And brother you're beginning to look a little worried. - Yeah, man, something strange is going down here. Tell my fighter's getting hurt pretty bad. You gotta stick around, we're gonna use your help. - I'm sitting right over there. All you gotta do is wave. (patting leg) (audience cheering) (boxers grunting) (audience cheering) (audience yelling) (bell ringing) - [Announcer] Referee stopping the fight. (audience cheering) Could not continue on so a technical knock out, the New Jersey team. (audience applauding and whistling) (bell ringing) (audience cheering) - So what's up? - Look man, my fighters are telling me there's something hard in the gloves so I'm gonna go check it out. If I'm not back in 10, find me. - So you want me to go with you? - I'm just gonna take a look right now. (audience cheering) (suspenseful music) - None of these damn things equal out, I want no part of this. - Yeah, just like in the first fight. Pet's my best fighter, personally trained by me. - I don't care who trained him. Look, it's my ass on the line, not yours if we lose. So you just shut the hell up. - Eh. - Now look, I want you to put these things in. - What about the ref? - Ah, don't worry, he's one of us. Go! Put these damn things in. (audience cheering) - You're on your Rossi. - On my own? What do you mean? - You guaranteed me a sure thing when I gave you the 100 grand for this karate tournament. - Look, it's in the bag. We can't lose. - I don't like the odds. It's down to one deciding fight. I don't place my bets that way Rossi. - Look, I've taken care of everything. We'll win. Look I guarantee it. - You already have, in writing. You blow this Rossi, I'll take more than my hundred grand from you. (suspenseful music) (footsteps clicking) - Well my fighters are right man. Those cats got enough metal to be robots. - I think it's time we drop a dime. - Yeah that's my thought too. So why don't you handle the rank, til I get back okay? - You got it. (suspenseful music) - [Announcer] This is the championship fight ladies and gentlemen. (crowd cheering drowns out announcer) (bell ringing) - Mr. Rossi? - Yeah? - We just saw that Chuck fellow hanging out here in the hall. I think he was spying on you. - Well don't worry about it, there's nothing he can do. But to be on the safe side, keep him out of the way til after the fights. (suspenseful music) (audience cheering and whistling) (boxers thudding) (audience cheering and whistling) (suspenseful music) (yelling and grunting) (suspenseful music) (audience cheering) (thudding) (audience cheering) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - What the hell are you doing? You're a hit man now? Who the hell told you you're a hit man? - Told me to keep him out of the way. - He said keep him out of the way, not kill him. (suspenseful music) - Come on, let's get out of here. (audience cheering and whistling) (bell ringing) (audience applauding) (audience chanting) - [Radio Announcer] There you have it ladies and gentlemen. The team from California wins the tournament and the $400,000 dollar pot. - No, no, he went to make a telephone call and I haven't seen him since. - Listen I've got to go to work now, so you guys come by the club later. Okay? - Yeah, right, okay. - [Radio Announcer] This is Larry Downes from WPIZ saying good night until next week when again, live here at the arena. The musical sensation of CBS recording star, Rodney Tiburn. Until then, stay well. (audience applauding) - Yeah Teri. - [Teri On Phone] Ralph, you found Chuck yet? - No, not yet. Relax now, he's bound to be around someplace. Listen I'm on my way over there soon as I finish up some business, okay? - [Teri Over Phone] Well you be careful yourself. I don't like what I feel about this whole trouble. - Take it easy, take it easy. Things gonna be all right. I'm gonna see the promoter of this fight, see when we get our money. (patrons talking) - I'm glad you could come out with me tonight. (glasses clink) You're very pretty. Thank you very much. (speaking quietly) - Mr. Spangler? - Yes? - You're the promoter of a karate tournament, is that right? - Yes I am. - Can I talk with you in private? - Discussing business after hours is not one of my policies. Why don't you call my secretary in the morning and arrange an appointment? - Discussion we have to have has to be handled right now. It's a small little problem with the $400,000 dollars for winning the tournament. - Oh yeah. Wow, I remember now, you're the PR man from California. Yes, yes, but the money, I don't have the money. And I didn't say you could sit. - I didn't ask. Now look, this place seems to be a pretty nice little set up here and I'd hate very much to mess up my new linen suit. Understand what I'm talking about? - Of course, of course. Laura, would you mind going to the car and get my attache case? I'm gonna make a few a few calls. Thank you. Kid from (mumbling). Look, what is your name? Well anyway, violence is not one of my... It's not my nature. - I'm very happy to hear that. It's about our money. Where is it and when can I get it? - Are you referring to the bet you made between your organization and the company of one Mr. Mario, right? Well it appears that you're right in stating that the money is yours however-- - Wait wait wait, wait. That word, however, usually precedes something I really don't want to hear. - I understand but believe me, the money is in the bank and you'll get it tomorrow. I'm trying to make out with this chick you see and I'd like to have dinner in private if you don't mind. - Hey, not a problem, I can understand that. I'm an easy man to get along with. It's a bitch when a bill collector comes around isn't it? Mr. Hanson, I'll be back if the debt isn't paid. - Thank you so much for dropping by. Good evening. Yes, thank you darling for getting it. Friend of mine from California. Look would you mind bringing that back because, you know what I really need? I need by other book, just a telephone book. I don't need that. Do you mind? Thank you. I'll make it up to you tonight. Eileen, phone please? - Yeah Teri. - [Teri Over Phone] Yes? Any word from Chuck yet? - [Teri Over Phone] No. - Look I'm on my way over there okay? - [Teri Over Phone] Okay bye. - Bye bye. (phone ringing) - It's Mario? Yeah this is Joe Spangler. Look, you may have some trouble heading your way. I suggest you take the $400,000 dollars out of the bank early tomorrow. No, no problem, it's my pleasure. Thank you Mr. Mario. Good night, have a pleasant night, thank you. (gentle piano music) (soft rock music) - Have you heard from Chuck? - No, I haven't heard from him. I'm worried 'cause they just towed his truck in a few minutes ago. - Towed it where? - The garage. - Which garage? - It's right next door. - Better check it out. Talk to you later. - [Teri] Okay. (gentle music) (gentle foot steps) (smacking) - Where's the driver of this car? - I don't remember. I suggest you mind your own business. - Listen, I don't the time or the patience to deal with any of your smart ass answers okay? (slams hood) - I don't remember getting any better. Car was left in the parking lot after the fight. So I pulled it in here. - Okay, let him go. I'll make a full investigation. - What the hell are you going to investigate sheriff? (slams hood) Get out of here. - Now why do you think someone would run and hurt your friend? - You mean kill him, don't you sheriff? - You got somebody in mind? - Maybe, but I don't want to go jumping to conclusions. - Show me where you found the car. I'll get the squad car. (slow mysterious music) - Chuck, my god you're hurt. Wait here I'll go get-- - No. I just need a place to hide right now. - Who are you talking to? - Oh my god, it's Chuck. Look, he's hurt, just keep quiet about this, okay? - What the hell's going on out here? We need our beer. - Hey, hey, hey, get back inside. Making all this noise don't make me work no faster. - I'll be okay. Call Ralph and tell him to bring a car here. And one more thing, call these numbers, tell them I need their help. Don't tell him what happened to me okay? I don't want them coming here shooting up to town. Just tell 'em we got problems. (mysterious music) (soft music) - Hey man, kind of all alone, ain't ya? Are you gonna fight all by yourself (laughing)? (soft piano music) - I talked to Chuck. - You did? Where is he? - He hurt, needs help. I was gonna call you. - What do you mean you're gonna call me? - Where is he? - He's outside around back. No no no, it's better to wait until closing. He wants you to bring a car around back and park it. - Okay. (gentle music) (mysterious music) - Hey, were are you going so fast? (moaning) - You get back inside you bonehead or I'm gonna tell Mr. Rossi you're out here bothering us and we can't get our work done 'cause of you! Are you okay? - Yeah. - I hope you know what you're doing. - Well what other choice is there? To turn them over to those men? Yes hello operator, I'd like to make two person-to-person phone calls. - It's closing time, come on everybody out of here. Come on. Come on. (gentle music) It's all right Teri, why don't y'all go on home. I'll close up. (soft music) - Now you let me know if you hear anything about your friend. - Yeah, okay. (upbeat music) (car engine starting) (upbeat rock music) - Come on man. You okay? - Mr. Rossi said he's trying to blow me away man. - Rossi? Why in the hell would he do something like that? - I don't know yet. Did we win? - Damn that man, yeah we won but what's going on? - That's the reason right there. - What? - Rossi doesn't tend to pay up. - He doesn't huh? - Where we going? - To my grandfather's cabin, it hasn't been used in a long time so it'll be safe there. - Okay, come on man.

(soft music) (keys rattling) - [J] Man, what are we looking for? - Hey, that's a good question man. I don't know yet. But Chuck's room seems like a good place to look for it. - Yeah, it's a good place to look for it all right. We don't know what we're looking for. I have no information. Messin' around. - Find something? - Yeah, a contract on the fight. It was signed by Mr. Rossi. Says that the money's in escrow down at the bank. Think we better take a walk down to the bank and check on that $200,000 dollars? - Yeah, okay. Look here, I'm gonna check on the car downstairs, change clothes, then I'm going to talk to this karate trainer that was at the tournament. Maybe he can give us some more information. - Yeah, it's okay. - I'm in 109. (soft music) - See the lady over there. (soft music) - Yes this contract is correct. The money was placed in escrow here. - Was put in escrow? Where is it now? - And who are you? - I want four names on that contract, I'm here to collect $200,000 dollars. When I have it, I'll be very happy to leave. - Well, you see, it's not here. - And where is it then? - Well, Mr. J, I can't answer that for you right now. I suggest you fill out this form and I'll look into it for you. - After I fill it out, where do I sign? (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna whisper this to you sir, in about five seconds, I'm gonna make an ink blotter out of you. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give you one more chance. Where's the money? - It was picked up by Mr. Mario. - And who's Mr. Mario? - He put up the money for the fight for Mr. Rossi. - And where can I find this Mr. Mario? - That's his card there on the desk. - Why couldn't you have done this in the first place? (man yelling in foreign language) - Hey can I talk to you for a minute? Aren't you the trainer at the karate tournament the other night? - [Trainer] Who are you? A cop? - No man, I'm not a cop. Why? You afraid of cops? I just want some answers, that's all. One of my friends seems to be in a little trouble. I'm just trying to help him out. - Who's your friend? - His name's Chuck. Karate fighter from California. - Yeah well I don't know anything about that. - What that? - Look I'm busy, I don't have time to talk. (broom swishing) - Everybody in this town's a cop, you ask questions, you get struck. (suspenseful music) Can we talk now? - Look it wasn't my idea. I just did what they told me. - What is it you did? - The fight against your friend was rigged. - Where's my friend now? - I don't know. - Just when you were doing so good. - No really, I don't know. He got wise the fight was rigged so they were afraid he would talk, they went after him. - Come on let's go. I know a few people who would like to hear your story. (pensive music) - You're not taking him nowhere. Let's see how well you know martial arts. - You may be good and kung-fu, but I'm an expert in gun-fu. Some other time mojo. Right now, I got more important things to do. Back off! (suspenseful music) Let's go. (suspenseful music) (dog growling) (suspenseful music) - Come in Mr. J. - I see you expected me. - You gave my banker quite a scare. He's not used to your rough tactics. - Yeah he had a problem answering my questions. I hope I don't have the same situation here. - The money you want's on the table. You're legally entitled to that money, your contract states that. The problem is I'm a bad loser. I don't always play by the rules, I usually make up my own. I got the money, you got the contract. The way I see it is we both need something from each other. My suggestion is why don't you just leave the contract here and leave as quietly as you can. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) Now get the money. (beeper beeping) - [Man] Hey, let's go. - We're on the fifth floor, it's a long way down to the street. - Yeah I know, I saw your folks downstairs but I hope you're in shape brother because you're gonna go with me. - Me, you got the cash. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - This thing ain't moving. We'll take the stairs, you wait here in case he does... (suspenseful music) - You stay here. We're going up. (suspenseful music) You watch this floor. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Go ahead. Go ahead. I might hit you. Might miss you. Now come on! (suspenseful music) - Nobody passed you? - No one. - They've gotta be in the garage. You go from the inside and I'll come around from the outside. (suspenseful music) - You stay here and be quiet. You might stay alive. I'll be right over there. (suspenseful music) - [Man] Mr. Mario, you okay? - Yeah. I'm all right. (suspenseful music) - Look out! (gun shooting) (suspenseful music) (gun shooting) (slow intense music) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - Here are your gun permits back. - Thank you sheriff. Can we go now? - Now I hope you fellas have finished playing detective. Leave the rest to us okay? Everywhere you go, a lot of dead bodies get left behind. - Better them than us sheriff. - See you later. Look, I've changed my mind. Maybe it's a good idea if you fellas do leave town. With a few more facts from that trainer in there, we can bring the other men to justice. - Okay that's fine with us, except the trainer was not around when the shooting started. - If you help us find Chuck, we'll be very happy to leave town. - That's my job. We'll get him. - Meantime sheriff if we find him first, we'll send up a smoke signal flight. (radio chatter) (upbeat music) (car engine starting) (upbeat music) (door closes) (water running) (gun clicks) - You always enter the shower with your gun? - Sometimes, it's a habit. Makes me feel more comfortable. Something you forget to tell us? - Come on in, the water's fine. - No, I don't think I'd be too safe in there. - You don't need that gun in here. (slow jazzy music) - So, you're from around here huh? - [Sally] Yeah, been planning all my life to leave but never have. - Well I don't think you'll have any problem doing that. - [Sally] What makes you say that? - Well you got some pretty strong persuasive powers, - Is it nice where you live? - Yeah, it's nice. - Did I miss something brother? - No man she just wanted to, you know-- - Yeah I know what she wanted man. - It was hard for me to talk at the bar. Some of those men there worked for Mr. Rossi. - Who's Mr. Rossi and why are you afraid of him? - Well from what I understand, Mr. Rossi had a bet with your friend and he had it fixed so he couldn't lose. - Yeah we know about the bet. Who's Teri? - She's a good friend of this Chuck. I think they have a thing going. - Do you know where she's at now? - [Sally] I think she's in big trouble, they brought your friend's car in and it had been all shot up. - Shot up? What happened to Chuck? - They went looking for him after the fight. They didn't find him. Later that night he came to the bar. - Is he hurt? - Yeah, he'd been shot. After work, Teri and a friend of his, I think his name is Ralph, they put him in the trunk of their car and drove off. About an hour later, Mr. Rossi drove up. That's all I know. - Chuck shot, Ralph missing, hey man-- - Yeah we gonna have start with that attendant, down at the station. That's if you can pull yourself away brother. - Look, I want to thank you for all the information. - Sure, anytime. If I remember anything else, I think I'll come back. - Yeah, you do that. (door closing) (suspenseful music) - Hey man, somebody's messing around. - Hey, you in the car, get out of there! (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (upbeat intense music) (guns firing) (tires squealing) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (upbeat music) (sirens wailing) (fire crackling) (police radio chattering) - You two couldn't wait to start shooting at people again could you? So who were you shooting at? - Two of your good citizens sheriff that shot at us. - Well why were they shooting at you? - Well we didn't get close enough to ask sheriff. - Well you come back to the office with me. I'll have to fill out a report. - For what? Hey man, you know the same thing we do. Two dudes shot at us, we shot back. - Now will you be staying at this hotel in case I need to see you again? - There doesn't seem to asleep in this town sheriff. (sirens wailing) (suspenseful music) - Can I help you? - You work here huh? - Yeah why? - We work for truth or consequences. - Hey what is this? Who the hell are you? - Who the hell am I? The owner of the vehicle over there, where is he? - I don't know. Please I don't have nothing to do with it. I got this call and told me I should go down and tell Mr. Rossi where this boy was. So I went down to his house that night to tell him. - Now tell us. - They found his girlfriend's car off Highway 42. - You told Rossi all of this? - Yes sir, that's exactly what I told him. - Keep your voice down, keep your mouth closed. Okay? (suspenseful music) (mumbling) (water splashing) (birds singing) (doors opening) (doors closing) - Hey Cal. Looks like a piece of a woman's blouse. - Yeah. - What do you think this is? - Looks like blood man. - Better check this place out. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) - J, looks like something Chuck might wear. (suspenseful music) - Who are you kid? - Frank Rimes. - What are you doing out here? - [Frank] Looking for you. - Why are you looking for us? - Are you Cal and J? - [Cal] Yeah, we're Cal and J. - Two of your friends are at our house. - Two of our friends? - Alright show us. - Chuck? - Gotta be. (footsteps crunching) - These are his friends of dad. - [Man] I've done about all I can for him. To stop the bleeding but he's still very weak. Keeps passing out. - [Cal] Where's the nearest hospital? - About five miles but he's been shot twice. The hospital will ask a lot of questions. - We'll face that problem when we have to. - Okay hold it. More dead bodies. - Don't touch him. - But I have to see him. - How did you know he was here? - How'd you know we were here? - Now what's that supposed to mean? - What it means is that if you're part of this bullshit your ass is gonna get it too. - Are you threatening the law? - Not putting anybody mister, I'm just telling you what we have to do that's all. Now what are you going to do? - Why don't you make yourself useful my man, and get an ambulance my friend here. - Oh call an ambulance. Emergency! Now I put a tail on you, they followed you here and called me. There's some questions I have to ask about one other dead body in the car we towed in. - What dead body? - Cal, damn. - Ralph was really good to set you up, K Man. But what the hell is going on around here? - J that's what I'm trying to figure out. We won the match and the only thing we've been able to collect is a bunch of lead. - Well only thing we've been able to collect man is a torn blouse that could have belonged to a woman. - Yeah we supposed to meet some chick at the bar and she never showed up. Teri have you seen her? - Well it could have been Teri's blouse. - You okay to travel? - [Chuck] Yeah, yeah. - Well let's boogie man. - We'll see you at the hospital sheriff. - Hey, I know you're tough brother, but you sure everything is alright? - Yeah doctor said everything's cool. Come on man we've all had our bumps and bruises now. - He's in pretty bad shape but luckily the bullets went straight through. He won't be in any shape to talk for a while yet. - Thanks doc. - I've been in this town and never delivered some answers. So the one possibility-- - Rossi? - That's right Rossi. - All right, we check out his pad, you check out the bar. We'll meet you there later. - Yeah, listen don't you guys have all the fun, save a little bit for me. - I got an idea brother there's gonna be a whole lot of fun for all of us. (suspenseful music) - Oh I'd love it, thanks. (women chatting) (suspenseful music) - What's the meaning of this? - I'm sorry, we're here to see Mr. Rossi. - You get out of here before I call the sheriff. Get out! - Call whoever you want lady. - Hey lady. (gun fires) (screaming) - Where is he lady? - He's not here right now. He's on his way back from town, he should be here in about five minutes. - I'm sure you don't mind if I wait and join the party. - No, have a seat. - Thank you. - Shh.
