In April 1961, Yuri Gagarin was the first man to arrive in the Cosmic Space. The space ship Vostok with Yuri Gagarin onboard has launched into space. Where for thousands of years the imagination of humans has created a fantastic land, of the after life. A place reserved for Angels and God. Arriving there, on his voyage, in the Cosmic Space or the Heavens, Gagarin was asked on his return by the Soviet Union officials, if he saw God up there, on his journey. The official answer was no. But for hundreds of years, the Christian artists, theologians and believers have imagined God existing far away, in the unknown abyss of sky, In the unknown depth of the clouds. Depictions of God though sometimes forbidden by dogma have imprinted the image of the Creator and the place where he exists, in countless paintings and frescoes. God, The Father, is up there, sitting on the throne of the boundless and tumultuous clouds, from the heights of creation. The "US Genesis-1491 Mission" from January 1962, aims to deepen observation from the Low Earth's orbit, of the unknown physical phenomena around the Earth, and the possibility of existence of a supernatural entity, assumed to God, on a location near our planet. My name is William Florescu, the astronaut of this mission. My father was an immigrant from Romania. I will be the fifth astronaut to see the Earth from Space. Gagarin, Shepard, Grissom, Titov were there before me. But I will spent the longest time, alone there, in Space, until now. But not much will be known about my mission. Because it has a special secret purpose. My job is to find if something extraordinary is happen in the outer space. Something supernatural, divine, mysterious, inexplicable. If anyone is living there. If there is a God, somewhere above us... THE ASTRONAUT OF GOD Genesis 1491! Here is Cape Canaveral transmitting in the blind! We ask you to confirm Omni Bravo, if you copy us! Genesis 1491, you may hear us! Confirm your location visually! Radiolocation is getting worse! We loose contact... We don't know at this time the reason. I'm afraid is a C.S.O error, during launching, but not sure. Please confirm message reception! In a moment the ridges of the clouds merge with the glow of the ruins, of the old abbey, and everything becomes like a painting by Gaugain; "Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we heading? Roger Mission Control! Here's Genesis 1491, I'm over Honduras, approximately, All systems go! It got hot around here but I'm going to turn off the ventilation manually. The C.O.2 level is low. Cab is at 14 psi, oxygen flows normally. But I'm about to orbit in the dark. Roger Genesis 1491! We hope to remedy the problem with radiolocation soon. To have you on the radar again. How is the view, up there William? Through the capsule's porthole, the blue Earth appears frail. Fine stretches of water like synapses, mountain chains and layers of clouds. Lovely view. But I turn my head and my gaze is absorbed, by the deep black of the Space. It feels like an infinity. What's there, so far away? Heaven, hell, God is here? There? In the same Universe and time with us? "An infinite Universe of worlds? Like Giordano Bruno believed. Before it was burned at the stake by Inquisition. The darkness has come. I'm alone. When I accepted this mission, I knew I should never loose my lucidity. Because there, in the Cosmic Space, the perceptions are different. The body and brain are deprived of gravity and air, and possible hallucinations, depression or other forms of unknown disease, can occur quickly. Vision is affected by cosmic radiation. The reality becomes different. The first orbit around the Earth begins. The Mission Time is 23 minutes, 28 seconds. Genesis 1491, here's Mission Control, transmitting in the blind from the ground. The radiolocation is not working! Genesis 1491, if you copy, confirm message reception! You have still 4 hours and 34 minutes of the mission. We cannot locate you at the moment! Confirm visually your location! Genesis 1491, answer! Mission Control, here is Genesis 1491, signal is weak but I can hear you. I'm in the dark approximately orbiting over the South China Sea. When will you fix the radiolocation? Genesis 1491, the boys are working on it. Anyway, until you get back into the atmosphere we will be ready. If not you will go manually. Right now you can deal it without us. William, your pulse in at 80 beats per minute. Blood pressure is good. The biometric data we receive is ok. We also have an electrocardiogram. Looks like you like the space. Ok. Genesis 1491, you should start A.S.C.S. test on manual control. Roger, Mission Control! Change on manual pitching. Roger, manual pitching. Pitching is ok. The launch day was on Thursday. At 14:34 hour and 8 seconds. The weather forecast was perfect. The day was perfect. What will I find? Will I return safely, to Earth? What will be the results of my research? My discoveries could change the humanity forever. Now I live the emotion of mission to the fullest and all those thoughts make me anxious. The capsule I am in now travels into orbit at 16000 mph. A full orbit of the capsule around the Earth takes 88 minutes. If everything goes as planned. A mere contemplation of the celestial vault, is sometimes enough to trigger an experience. But to orbit around the Earth is something reserved for a demigod. Everything on Earth-the Romanian people believed, - is born and dies; No one can stop this. What is in sky is eternal; there is the good place: with light, with trees and with sweetness; there, God is close. And on some days of the year the sky opens, and our world contacts the afterworld" my father, Dragomir, told me. He had emigrated from Romania, before the Great War. He had worked on the railways and never had flew with a plane. Like for millenia man did not reach above the height of the mountains. Today the sky has opened for me. Genesis 1491, if all systems go, you can start the visual observation. Mission Control, yes, all systems are go. I start shooting. My task is to document in physical parameters, any unusual experience that might take place, in this new environment for man, while orbiting the Earth. To film any anomaly or mysterious fact, that is happening in this forbidden space for man, until now. Up there, where gods are living. Like a mystical explorer of the sacred mountains of Tibet or Olympus, or Hara Berezaiti, the mountain of Zarathrusta, around which the stars and planets revolve. I am where no one was until now. Further to gravity. To the stars. I'm an astronaut. And I'm searching... But nothing special happens yet. I only feel the traces of cosmic radiation when I close my eyes, and small colored sparks cross the blackness of my eyelids. And my head seems a little swollen but it doesn't hurt. The Mission Time is 38 minutes, 9 seconds. And I found nothing or no one here. William, we thought you should relax a bit. Emma is going to tell you something. Ok. "When all the stars are sown Across the night-blue space, With the immense unknown, In silence face to face. We stand in speechless awe While Beauty marches by, And wonder at the Law Which wears such majesty." My colleagues asked me to recite a little. I think it fits perfectly, up there. Yes. It's Bliss Carman. Nice from you, Emma. I continue to shoot. I need more filming. Be carefull, William! I want to come back with great results. I need to find out something... But nothing. I'm in Space and I see nothing which not be prepared at ground. Which I hadn't imagined in so many white nights. Which weren't be planned. It's exactly what I wanted. But it's hard for me. Some insidious feeling of abandonment lurks in me. The Earth is beautiful. But so alone. Like me. I’m waiting. There has to be more here. Something, someone... One day we will be ruins. And the stars will fade out. But, we'll look further. An astronaut is always searching. I am the Astronaut. I am orbiting over Egypt. But, I don't see the pyramids from Space. On the control panel I have painted the "Horus's eye". The one that protects and gives health to the navigators. Now, I am a free spirit and I travel through the sky, like Thoth, on Ra's boat. Thoth, the god with the head of ibis, the one who made the calculations to establish the heavens, the stars, the Earth and all that is in them. Knowledge should not be possessed by humans. It is the apex of the gods. "Thoth's Book" should never be known. The secret science of communicating with animals and understanding the gods. That, would have told me 4 millennia ago, in Ancient Egypt, if I had gone sent by a rebel pharaoh on such a quest. I'm still shooting. What the!? What the heck! Mission Control, I hear beating outside the capsule! Genesis 1491, repeat, please! Mission Control, something or someone hit the capsule cockpit 4 times, repeatedly! Roger. Genesis 1491. Start shooting. I already do it... Mission Control, what can it be? Probably a collision with a group of meteors. There may be more of them. Negative, Mission Control, I didn't see anything on porthole. Are you still hearing it? It's quiet now. I start check all systems. All systems go. Oxygen is fine. Batteries are at 80%. CO 2 is a bit high, but. Roger Genesis 1491. Start the ventilation manually. You should lower your CO2 level until you return to atmosphere. You still have to stay. What the!? What the heck! Damn it! Damn it! I was hit! It's an asteroid! I have to stabilize the capsule! Genesis 1491, what happened? What are your flying data? Genesis 1491, do you copy us? I was able to film it, yeah... Mission Control, it's hard for me to estimate the dimensions, but smaller than the capsule. Mission Control, I loose oxygen! It's an emergency! William, do you copy? Not great, Mission Control! Genesis 1491, do you copy? We don't get signal from you. Mission Control, I was hit, I'm trying to stabilize A.S.C.S. Genesis 1491, we do not receive you! Our data shows you are orbiting far too South. No! Capsule trajectory is deflected. You go to uncontrolled descent! Genesis 1491 we don't hear you at all! Mission Control, I confirm, I'm ok. I'm fine! I stabilized the capsule. Mission Control! Genesis 1491, start the retro thrusters, manually! Set nose to 34 degrees yawn. What?! You have to go on an emergency re-entry. You get the wrong data! Our data shows that you entered on drifted trajectory for descent. With 230m per second. You're falling, William! Mission Control, I confirm, I'm ok! I'm fine! You get the wrong data. I stabilized the capsule. Mission Control! Genesis 1491, do you copy? Mission Control, yes, I can hear you! I'm talking! I'm here! Do you hear me? Genesis 1491, we do not receive you! William, our biometric data shows you have a declining pulse. You approach 40 beats per minute. Turn on the emergency oxygen! Mission Control, I don't feel any change. Maybe a little warm, but... William, our data shows us, zero pulse! William what's going on with you? Reply! Mission Control! I'm good! Don't you hear me? Mission Control, the sensors were probably blown, after the impact with the asteroids. Or it's another unknown error. Genesis 1491, we do not hear you. Wake up, William! Puls zero. He went into cardiac arrest. Already lost his consciousness. My God... William wake up! William, don't die... What the?! William, wake up ...! Turn on the extra oxygen. You went into hypoxia. Zero pulse... Mission Control, answer! Mission Control, here astronaut William Florescu, of US Genesis 1491 mission, on Genesis 1491 ship, do you copy me? Mission Control, do you hear me? Mission Control... I didn't die... Impossible. You received incorrect data. Mission Control... I'm aware! Mission Control... The Mission Time is 48 minutes, 55 seconds. William, are you ok? What's happening to you? Keep your cold blood. Lucidity was your guardian angel for so many times. Mission Control, the Mission Time has blocked at 48 minutes and 55 seconds. The timer has failed, I think... Something happens with temperature sensors, also. It's a little warm, although, in capsule are only 41 degrees -F. And my chest hurts a bit, but I suspect, it's because of the lack of gravity. I hit my wrist, and my head a little too. Mission Control, something is happening on the control panel. I can't reset the communication buttons. It looks like a short circuit. Strangely. I'm afraid it won't be totally interrupted. Mission Control, I will monitor and record, the physical parameters outside the capsule, for the next orbit. According to the mission procedure. I'm trying to continue the mission. Mission Control, the oxygen level has been constant for too long. The gauge has broken too, I suspect... Level is not dropping. It’s not possible to consume nothing! I am breathing. Or maybe I don't see well. I'm going to track it. The level of carbon dioxide has increased, in the meantime. I'm a little worried. Mission Control, I do not know if you copy me, I do not receive you, but I will continue to talk about the procedures I perform. They will be recorded in the mission's log. I try to record the outdoor data. Exterior radiation looks stable. About 37-48 Megalectronvolt. Ionizing radiation, 91mileSiverti. The temperature about to -58 Fahrenheit, it got warmed up. I am orbiting with 17424 miles per hour. Over 30-35 minutes I reach apsis altitude. High visibility, 125 degrees. I filmed about 4 minutes. I have still another one hour of unused reel. I am still shooting and taking outside data. The communication with the Earth has been lost. I try to continue the mission by myself. What else, could I do? I continue to search. But, nothing special... Maybe it's an answer. I'm not feeling well. I have a pulse in my left hand, on my fingers. How did Bruno's inquisitors sign his death sentence? Holding firmly fingers around the pen? With shaking hands, with doubts? I probably did a stretching of the tendons of the fingers. I don't have too much power when I clench my fist. I need to focus. Mission Control, our communication is still recorded even if you don't copy. I will continue speaking... But... I'm starting to have... some kind... of visions, I don't know … something happens to me, when I close my eyes I see, I see... I see... Mission Control, here's Genesis 1491! Do you copy? I just heard music outside the capsule! Mission Control, I hear something out there, it's a song, it sounds like, But of course, it can't be music. There is no sound in Space, no sound waves can propagate in the cosmic vacuum, Mission Control... something sounded like music. I can't explain... Maybe, it was a frequency interference. It's quiet now. Very strange. Mission Control, do you copy? Mission Control, I am orbiting above Indonesia, approximately. The flight parameters are restored. Oxygen is at 44%. I repressurized the ship. I have no serious damage. Maybe, the telecommunication antenna was hit by meteoroids. I don't know if you hear me... Mission Control I don't hear you. I'm alone again. If... Blocked, between two worlds. The Earth and the Deep Black Space. What should I do? I cancel, yes, I come back. Enough of this, there's nothing here. Just an hostile and strange place. Mission Control, I’m transmitting in the blind. Mission Control, if you somehow receive me, you must know that I have start the procedure of reentry into the atmosphere. Due to the strange events that happened, and the lack of communication with the Earth, I cannot continue the mission. I finish the mission earlier. I'm sorry, I don't have great results. Just a concussion on the head. I'm comming home Yes, I'm leaving here. I'm returning home. In about 15 minutes I estimate I get the atmosphere re-enter window. What the hell? Mission Control the Automatic Positioning System no longer works. A wave of galactic radiation melted the circuits. Damn it! Some chip. Maybe. I have no other explanation... I do not know what happened. Where did this wave came from. Maybe it's a Solar blast. What the hell! There are 3 minutes until I return to Earth's atmosphere. The trajectory is good, I remain on manual control. But! But... something stands out at the window! Something is going on outside the capsule! I do not know what this is. It could be a radiation globe or something else. A plasma body, better said. A radiating globe. Something completely new... and unknown. Or... an entity. Something allien. Maybe alive. It's difficult to appreciate the distance, I have no landmarks, and the shape or the entity seems to be moving towards the capsule. I have to get closer! I change my position manually. I'm getting closer. With any risk! I’m recording! It's extraordinary! It is an unnatural presence somewhere at 28 degrees port of capsule I have to shoot! Mission Control! It is an evolving form, Mission Control, similar to a butterfly of small size, that radiates in shades of orange. It's beautifull! I'm recording. It's extraordinary. What is this? Mission Control, repeat please! I do not understand! Mission Control, please repeat! Mission Control! Mission Control ...are you? Or... Who are you? Are you trying to comunicate with me? Is it an audio interference? What happens? Mission Control, the entity I film affects the audio communication. Or they try to communicate with me, I don't realize what is it But my chest hurts, harder. I feel a sting, in the sternum. Mission Control, something extraordinary is happening. Mission Control, something extraordinary is there! I hope you receive me! Mission Control, I don't have much time. The gravity increases. The Earth attracts me. I put the retro thrusters on, I try to keep a little more. The entity is approaching me. "No one saw God, at any time”, wrote the Apostle John And early Christians believed, that no one could see God and live afterwards. I shot something exceptional. An entity. A supernatural being who, maybe was trying to communicate with me. Alien. Angelic. Divine. Or it is a completely unknown physical phenomenon for science. But I have proof of existence. In the Space, unimaginable things are happening, near our planet. I have proof. I have the evidence, for the first time. Something was happening up, here in the sky, in the heavens. Mission Control, I can't keep up The gravity increases! I reentry! My coordinates are... Genesis 1491, if you hear us, confirm the reception! Genesis 1491, we lost radio communication for 21 minutes, Genesis 1491, do you copy? Genesis 1491, our biometric data tells us that you are alive now. You came back! Your pulse is approaching 90 beats per minute. Genesis 1491, if you copy us please confirm! Genesis 1491, if you hear us prepare for re-entry. We fixed the radiolocation. You are crossing over the South Atlantic. You may experience some waves of high radiation. You are crossing South Atlantic Anomally. Genesis 1491, the radiolocation is getting worse, again get ready for... for Mission Control, I hardly hear you. I am alive! I filmed something extraordinary. Something supernaturally exists out here. William, we're glad! You were in cardiac arrest for 5 minutes. We thought we lost you. Mission Control, no, I wasn't. Mission Control, I shot something extraordinary. I have the proof. Of a superior form of existence or some unbelievable phenomena. William! William, you were probably in hypoxia. You’ve had hallucinations due to the high level of breathed carbon dioxide. You also crossed a huge intensity field of radiation. The South Atlantic Anomally. Like never before. Our colleagues from the Institute never recorded such high values! William, turn on the emergency oxygen! Misson Control, no, no, I wasn't! William, get ready for... William, the radiolocation is constantly deteriorating. Something happened again to the system. We cannot identify the problem now and We don't know where you are! And where will you gonna land. The boys are working on an estimate. But you moved away from the sea coast landing perimeter. William, continue the maneuvers. At 10,000 feet the baroswitch of the main chute will be activated. If not, do it manually. Or use the backup chute. William, we are not copy you at the moment... We hope you can handle it. You have to. Genesis 1491, if you copy us Try to not modify the … William... We are losing you! William, you disappeared from the radar. All things are in the Universe, and the Universe is in all things: we in it, and it in us; in this way, everything concurs in perfect unity. Giordano Bruno, Cause, Principle. And Unity, 1584 Later, I understood everything. With disappointment and sadness, though. I managed to save myself from the emercency re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. On January 2, 1962. I had serious damage to the space capsule but in the end it survived exceptionally. It seems my engineers did a great job with the design. For me a luxurious shoulder, bruises and a psychic state of confusion. But I got back. I also took the camera, with the precious shooting. But the film the whole reel to my shock had only recorded a few minutes of flight. The rest is empty. Nothing special on the the cosmic capsule shootings. No mysterious presence. No God, no superior form of extraterrestrial life, no unknown cosmic phenomenon. Only the expeditionary filming, with the Earth seen from Space from the first minutes of the mission. 6 minutes, 27 seconds. Just that. I haven't found anything How was that possible? The explanation for that, given by my doctors was, that after I get hit by the asteroid, the capsule start to loose oxygen. I quickly lost consciousness and went into a dangerous state of hypoxia. The lack of normal oxygen saturation in blood for the brain and carbon dioxide intoxication, produced by own breathing causes strong hallucinations. An abnormal mental state in which a person, has the illusion of perceiving non-existent things. All that I saw was just the product of my imagination, of an oxygen-free brain. A 21-minute dream. Long and strange as the Mission Control lost the radio connection with me. I didn't shoot anything out of the ordinary. Nothing happened up there. Than the unfortunate impact with the asteroid. And the strong hallucination, due to the lack of appropriate oxygen saturation of the brain. I'm a scientist. Science got me up there. And I find the explanation plausible. However, I do not explain how and why, I get my consciouness back during the reentry. From the blackout. Maybe it's just luck. My destiny. The US Genesis 1491 missions, and the secret research program of paranormal phenomena in low Earth's orbit, has not been continued. For hundreds of years our telescopes have searched the sky and the stars. For now there is no mystery above the clouds near the Earth. Just the risky desire of man to get there and look haughty behind. From above. Near the God of the past. But, there is no God in the cosmic space. That's what I believe, today. I haven't met him. Or maybe, just as Hamlet cannot meet Shakespeare, neither can creation, meet the Creator, And man, the God... But I will look further, deeper on Space. In an infinite Universe of worlds and galaxies. Same as Giordano Bruno, the medieval monk, believed once. Because an astronaut is always searching. Further. On and on. To the stars. I am the astronaut of God. And I will find the answer... The Mission Time has been reset.
