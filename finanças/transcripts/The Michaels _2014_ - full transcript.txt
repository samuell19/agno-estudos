[soft music] ♪ [alarm beeping] - [scatting] ♪ I'VE WAITED PATIENTLY ♪ TO HOLD YOU IN MY HEART ♪ ♪ THIS IS WHAT IT MEANT TO BE ♪ ♪ DON'T TEAR US APART ♪ IF YOU WANT ME ♪ KEEP ME IN MY YOUTH - MORNING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - GOOD MORNING, LORI. - GOOD MORNING, KATHERINE. - I'M ON MY WAY TO COURT FOR THE MARTIN CASE. OH, NO, JACK WANTED ME TO REVIEW THE MCQUE CASE. - I'M GETTING THE FILES. AND...THERE. EMAILED. AND DON'T FORGET, YOU HAVE MRS. BENNETT FIRST THING TOMORROW. - RIGHT. I'LL GO OVER EVERYTHING AFTER COURT. WAIT, I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET MARCIE, AND THEN WE HAVE DINNER. WELL, WHO NEEDS SLEEP? - THE MARTIN CASE? - THANK YOU. - I AM NOT GIVING UP MY BASEBALL CARDS. I'VE BEEN COLLECTING THOSE SINCE I WAS A KID. AND MY WIFE, SHE WOULDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BABE RUTH AND A BABY RUTH. - SHE'S DOING THIS AS LEVERAGE. SHE'S NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR BASEBALL CARDS, BUT SHE IS INTERESTED IN THE SUMMER HOME. SHE'S NOT GETTING EITHER. - ALL RISE. BE SEATED. GOOD MORNING. I HOPE EVERYONE'S HAD A CHANCE TO CONSIDER THEIR LAST REQUESTS BEFORE I MAKE A FINAL RULING. COUNSELOR. - YES, YOUR HONOR. THERE IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE DIVISION OF ASSETS-- A RATHER LARGE, VALUABLE BASEBALL CARD COLLECTION. - OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. THE COLLECTION WAS INHERITED BY MY CLIENT BEFORE HIS MARRIAGE, WHICH EXCLUDES MRS. MARTIN FROM CLAIMING ANY OWNERSHIP TO IT. - MY CLIENT ADDED SEVERAL VERY VALUABLE CARDS TO THE COLLECTION. HOWEVER, IF MR. MARTIN IS ATTACHED TO THE COLLECTION, MRS. MARTIN WILL CONSIDER TRADING THIS ASSET FOR ANOTHER. - LIKE THE SUMMER HOME? - WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT A FAIR TRADE. - YOUR HONOR. MR. MARTIN'S CORPORATION RECENTLY TOOK OWNERSHIP OF THE COLLECTION IN QUESTION. PER CALIFORNIA STATE CORPORATE PROPERTY LAWS, THIS EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES MRS. MARTIN FROM CLAIMING THE COLLECTION OR ANY INCREASE IN VALUE. NOW, I PROPOSE THAT THIS ASSET AND ALL OTHER ASSETS BE DIVIDED AS PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON, AND THAT WE FINALIZE THE DISSOLUTION OF THIS MARRIAGE. - I AGREE, COUNSELOR. - HEY, MARCIE. - HEY, KAT. - HEY, CHUCK. - HEY, KATHERINE. - WE HAVE A VANILLA LATTE READY FOR YOU. - OH, BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. SORRY I'M SO LATE. I WAS STUCK IN COURT. - CHUCK, I'LL BE GONE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. - GOT IT. - SO DID YOU WIN? - WE WON, BUT IT WASN'T PRETTY. IT JUST NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME HOW WIDE-EYED AND OPTIMISTIC COUPLES START OUT AND HOW MEAN-SPIRITED AND VINDICTIVE THEY END UP. - MAYBE THEY WERE NEVER RIGHT FOR ONE ANOTHER IN THE FIRST PLACE. - MAYBE. BUT IF THEY'D HAD A PRENUP, THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO BE SO NASTY TO ONE ANOTHER. - NOT THIS AGAIN. - MARCIE, YOU'VE GOT A BUSINESS TO PROTECT. OKAY, I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT THIS. - I HATE TALKING ABOUT THIS. - BUT TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT A PRENUP AS BEING UNROMANTIC. IT'S SIMPLY PRACTICAL. IT'S LIKE CAR INSURANCE. YOU DON'T PLAN ON DRIVING YOUR CAR INTO A FIRE HYDRANT, BUT IF YOU DO, YOU'RE COVERED. - OKAY. I'M NEVER DRIVING WITH YOU AGAIN. KAT, I KNOW YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT ME, BUT I LOVE RICK WITH ALL OF MY HEART, AND GETTING A PRENUP FEELS LIKE I'M SETTING OUR MARRIAGE UP TO FAIL. NOW, CAN YOU PLEASE SLIP OUT OF DIVORCE ATTORNEY MODE AND INTO BEST FRIEND/ROOMMATE/ MAID OF HONOR MODE? - YES. - GOOD. 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR DORA. - IF SHE'S ALL-KNOWING, SHOULDN'T SHE KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE LATE? - SHE'S NOT ALL-KNOWING. - NO KIDDING. - SHE KNOWS THINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. SHE IS VERY INSIGHTFUL. - SHE GIVES MANICURES. - THE DAY I MET RICK, SHE TOLD ME I'D MEET THE MAN WHO WILL ETERNALLY SET MY HEART ON FIRE. NOW TRY TO TELL ME SHE DOESN'T KNOW THINGS. - ALL I NEED FOR HER TO KNOW ABOUT IS MY DRY CUTICLES. - HAVE A SEAT. [laughs] SO LET ME SEE THOSE NAILS. WHOO! SO TELL DORA. HOW ARE THE WEDDING PLANS COMING ALONG? - OKAY, I GUESS. I'M JUST FOCUSING ON THE PRIZE: THE HONEYMOON. WE'RE GOING TO PARIS. - OOH, LA, LA. - BUT DORA KNOWS THAT, RIGHT? - DON'T MIND KAT. SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU PREDICTED WHEN I'D MEET RICK. - MOST PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE. IT TAKES AN OPEN HEART. - I BELIEVE IN FACTS. - BUT THERE IS A MATCH FOR EVERYONE. - DO YOU SEE A MATCH FOR KATHERINE? - MARCIE, DON'T. - YES. DORA SEES A MATCH, EVEN FOR KATHERINE. I SEE... I SEE... IT'S COMING TO ME. I'M FEELING IT. OH. HE IS... MICHAEL. - NO WAY. THAT IS SO SPECIFIC. - I'M MEETING A MICHAEL. WHEN? CAN I PENCIL HIM IN? MY SCHEDULE'S KINDA PACKED. - MICHAEL. - EXACTLY. - TO THE FUTURE MISTER AND MISSUS, CHEERS. - NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. THIS DINNER IS FOR YOU AND KAT. A THANK YOU FOR BEING OUR BEST MAN AND MAID OF HONOR. IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU TWO FINALLY MET. - AH, GUYS. WE APPRECIATE IT. CHEERS. - AND I REALLY APPRECIATE A HOME-COOKED MEAL. STILL HAVEN'T UNPACKED MY KITCHEN YET. - TOM, WHEN DID YOU MOVE BACK INTO TOWN? - IT'LL BE A MONTH NEXT WEEK. - [laughs] - I KNOW, I KNOW. SO KATHERINE, WHAT KIND OF LAW DO YOU PRACTICE? - SHE'S A DIVORCE LAWYER. SHE HELPS PEOPLE BREAK UP 70 HOURS A WEEK. - OH, COME ON, HON. SOMETIMES, SHE HELPS PEOPLE STAY TOGETHER. RIGHT? - NO, NOT REALLY. - OH. I THINK THAT WOULD GET A LITTLE DEPRESSING AFTER A WHILE. - ACTUALLY, PEOPLE ARE SO RELIEVED TO FINALLY BE RID OF THEIR SPOUSES, THEY CAN'T THANK ME ENOUGH. - DUDE, YOU DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE DOES. - ARE YOU A MATCHMAKER? [laughter] - NO. HE'S A NOVELIST. - I WROTE A BOOK A COUPLE YEARS AGO, AND IT DID PRETTY WELL, SO I WROTE ANOTHER ONE. - TOM, SHE ONLY READS MURDER MYSTERIES AND LAW JOURNALS. SHE HATES GUSHY LOVE STORIES. - OH, OKAY. - I DON'T HATE LOVE STORIES. - KAT, WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING TODAY HOW YOU'RE NOT A BELIEVER. BUT THAT MAY CHANGE SOON. - NO. - DORA MADE A PREDICTION. - OOH. YOU SAW DORA. - WHO'S DORA? - A CHARLATAN. - MY MANICURIST. SHE KNEW THAT RICK AND I WOULD FALL IN LOVE, AND NOW SHE SEES THAT FOR KAT. - REALLY? - I KNOW. SHE'S LIKE A MATCHMAKER. SHE SAW KAT'S MR. RIGHT. HIS NAME IS MICHAEL. - [shrieks] - OOH. - DO YOU NOT LIKE ANY "MICHAELs"? IS THAT THE PROBLEM? - [sighing] - HE'LL PROBABLY LET YOU CALL HIM "MIKE." - [laughs] - MIKEY? - [sighs] SO HOW'S MY DAY LOOK? - IT'S PACKED, BUT PRETTY FRONT-LOADED. YOU MAY GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE 8:00. - HM. NICE. - 9:30 CALL WITH OPPOSING COUNSEL ON THE GREENWALT CASE. 11:00 MEETING WITH ANNE ABOUT THE DALTON CASE. MR. KING AT 12:15, MRS. SWEENEY, A NEW CLIENT AT 1:45, MRS. HILNER-REISMAN-FORD AT 3:30. - REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS JUST MRS. HILNER-REISMAN? THAT WAS A PRETTY CUT AND DRY SPLIT. - [knocks at door] - GOOD MORNING, JACK. - KATHERINE. GREAT WORK ON THE MARTIN CASE. - THANK YOU. - IN FACT, WE'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE OVER THE BARNWORTH CASE. - GREAT. - THEY'LL BE HERE AT 4:30. - OKAY. - YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE CHAT WE HAD LAST WEEK? KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, AND I THINK YOU'LL BE ONE OF THE YOUNGEST PARTNERS THIS FIRM HAS EVER SEEN. - PARTNER. - I KNOW. MR. BARNWORTH HAS AGREED TO GIVE MRS. BARNWORTH THE HOMES IN MALIBU, SEDONA, AND FLORIDA. IN RETURN, MR. BARNWORTH WOULD RETAIN MRS. BARNWORTH'S SHARES IN BARNWORTH-BOYD. - NO, I CHANGED MY MIND. - MRS. BARNWORTH IS NOT INTERESTED IN RELINQUISHING HER SHARES UNLESS MR. BARNWORTH GIVES HER THE ANTIQUE CAR COLLECTION AS WELL. - WHAT? - THE VALUE OF THE REAL ESTATE FAR EXCEEDS THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE SHARES. - AND WHAT OF MY VALUE? I KEPT HIS HOME FOR 32 YEARS. I WANT THE CARS. - THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU DON'T EVEN DRIVE A STICK SHIFT. - WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU DROVE ONE OF THEM? YOU JUST WASH AND POLISH THEM. - MARCIE'S ON LINE TWO. - CAN YOU TAKE A MESSAGE? - SHE SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. - I TAKE CARE OF MY VALUABLES. - WELL, CLEARLY THAT'S NOT TRUE, OR WE WOULDN'T BE HERE. - MARCIE, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF-- - REMEMBER MY FRIEND AMY? - WHAT? - WELL, I WAS CHATTING WITH HER EARLIER, AND-- - NO, MARCIE. I'M WITH CLIENTS. - I JUST WANNA KNOW IF THAT'S OKAY. 7:00 AT MY COFFEE BAR? - YEAH, YEAH, SURE. WHATEVER. - SHE SAID YES. SHE'S GONNA GO OUT WITH YOUR BROTHER, MICHAEL.

OF COURSE. JUST EXCUSE ME FOR ONE SECOND. - YEAH. - HI. - HI. UM, WHO IS THAT? - IT'S THE DATE I TOLD YOU ABOUT. - WHEN DID YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT? - TODAY, WHEN I CALLED YOU. REMEMBER? I SAID I WAS TALKING TO MY FRIEND AMY, AND SHE MENTIONED HE BROTHER MIKE, WHO'S SINGLE. - MARCIE, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY HECTIC MEETING. I'M SORRY. I WASN'T EVEN LISTENING TO YOU. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU INTERRUPTED ME FOR? - YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT. IT'S JUST YOUR FUTURE HUSBAND, FAMILY, NICE HAPPINESS. - I HAD THE LONGEST DAY. I REALLY DON'T FEEL LIKE BEING ON A DATE RIGHT NOW. - IT'S JUST COFFEE. CHUCK. - COMING. - RELAX. YOU LOOK GREAT. A LITTLE CAFFEINE, A LITTLE SUGAR, YOU'LL PERK RIGHT UP. JUST TALK TO HIM. HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY. SMILE. YEAH. - YEAH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. SO INSTEAD, THE CLIENT COMPLETELY CHANGES THEIR MIND THE NIGHT BEFORE THE PRESENTATION. SO NOW, WE HAVE TO START OVER AND WORK ALL NIGHT LONG. - YEAH, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I WILL BE PREPARED FOR TRIAL, AND THEN--BOOM-- MY CLIENT OR THE SOON-TO-BE-EX WILL ALL OF A SUDDEN DECIDE THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER SATISFIED WITH THE TERMS THAT EVERYBODY ALREADY AGREED UPON. - I KNOW. I KNOW. - [laughs] - HONESTLY, IT'S LIKE WITH JOBS LIKE OURS, IT'S LIKE WE NEED SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO AT THE END OF A LONG DAY. - I AGREE. I LIKE TO HOP INTO A BUBBLE BATH, READ A GOOD BOOK. I JUST STAY IN THERE UNTIL I GET ALL PRUNE-Y. [both laugh] - OH. - UH, WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT DO YOU DO TO RELAX? - I AM INTO VENTRILOQUISM. - [laughs] RIGHT. WHA--WHAT IS IT, REALLY? - [sighs] KATHERINE, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET MIKEY, JR. - MIKEY, JR.? - HANDSOME LITTLE FELLOW, ISN'T HE? HE'S MY LITTLE BUDDY. SAY HELLO TO KATHERINE. HELLO, KATHERINE. [chuckles] HE'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A LAZY EYE, BUT-- UH, THERE WE GO. HE'S BACK. - WOW. - YEAH, YEAH, HE'S MY GUY, AND-- AND WE DRESS ALIKE. - I CAN SEE THAT. SO WHO PICKED OUT THE HAT? - HE DID. SO ANYWAY, LET ME THINK OF A JOKE, IF I CAN THINK OF ONE. I'VE BEEN FEELING SO DENSE LATELY. [laughs] - VENTRILOQUISM, MARCIE. VENTRILOQUISM. [both laugh] WHAT KIND OF MAN BRINGS A DOLL ON A DATE? - [snickers] - OH, IT'S HILARIOUS. - I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST-- WELL, IT SEEMED SO PERFECT. NEXT TIME, I WILL BE MORE DISCERNING. - NEXT TIME? NO. THERE'S NOT GONNA BE A NEXT TIME. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MICHAEL IS YOUR DESTINY. - PLEASE, DORA IS A KOOK, AND THIS IS ALL NONSENSE. - WELL, RICK AND I, WE-- - AND IF, FOR SOME REASON, IT'S TRUE, DON'T YOU THINK THAT I'M MEANT TO FIND HIM ON MY OWN WITHOUT YOUR HELP? - SO YOU DO BELIEVE? - I BELIEVE I JUST HAD THE STRANGEST FIRST DATE OF MY LIFE THANKS TO YOU AND DORA. - HEY, IT WAS A FIRST DATE, YOUR FIRST FIRST DATE IN MONTHS. - NOT HELPING. - ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE. ONE MICHAEL DOWN. ACTUALLY, 1 1/2 IF YOU COUNT MIKEY, JR. [both laugh] POPCORN? - [sighs] - YES, SIR, LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET HER. MAX BARNWORTH IS ON LINE TWO.

[indistinct chatter] - HEY, LADY, CAN I GIVE YOU A RIDE? - EXCUSE ME? OH, HEY. I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT WE WERE MEETING AT THE CAFE AROUND THE CORNER. - YEAH, WE WERE.

YOU ARE A STRICT TASKMASTER. I SHOULD KEEP YOU ON SPEED DIAL WHEN I HAVE WRITER'S BLOCK. - YES, I'LL HAPPILY NAG YOU NEXT TIME YOU'RE BEHIND ON A DEADLINE, BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A REHEARSAL DINNER TO PLAN. WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS? - WELL, I DID THINK IT'D BE NICE IF AT THE DINNER, WE BOTH SHARE SOME STORIES ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIPS WITH RICK AND MARCIE. - LIKE A SPEECH? - BASICALLY, YEAH. - NO, I DON'T DO THAT. I'M NOT GOOD AT THAT. - YOU TALK FOR A LIVING. - I ARGUE FOR A LIVING. - AH. OKAY, OKAY. FAIR ENOUGH. HOW ABOUT FOR NOW, WE START WITH THE EASIER STUFF? LIKE WHERE ARE WE THROWING THIS PARTY? AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT ARE WE GONNA EAT? - THAT, I HAVE IDEAS ABOUT. [laughs] UH, RICK AND MARCIE LOVE THIS PLACE. THEY ORDER TAKEOUT FROM THERE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. AND MARCIE WANTED TO USE THIS ONE BAKERY FOR THE CAKE, BUT IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE, BUT I FIGURE A COUPLE DOZEN CUPCAKES HAS TO BE CHEAPER THAN A WEDDING CAKE. - YEAH, THAT ALL SOUNDS AWESOME. - GREAT. FOOD. DING. both: DONE. - WE ARE ON TOP OF IT. - SO HOW'S MICHAEL? - I'M SORRY, WHO? - MICHAEL? - UH, I'D PREFER NOT TO GET STARTED ON THAT. [laughs] I CAN'T DO NICE THINGS FOR MARCIE WHILE THINKING ABOUT THE MONSTER SHE'S CREATED. - UH-OH. HOW MANY MICHAELS HAVE THERE BEEN SO FAR? - [sighs] TECHNICALLY, THERE'S ONLY BEEN 1 1/2 MICHAELS. YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW. - OKAY, IF WE CINCH THE BODICE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE, IT'LL FIT SNUG LIKE YOU LIKE. - SO I KNOW YOU SAID NO MORE SETUPS, BUT I BELIEVE IT IS MY DUTY TO FIND YOUR MICHAEL. - OH, REALLY? HOW SO? - KAT, EVERY DAY, I SERVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, AND MOST OF THEM TAKE THEIR COFFEES TO GO, WHICH MEANS I PUT THEIR NAMES ON CUPS. AND TODAY, A VERY HANDSOME GUY NAMED MICHAEL CAME IN AND ORDERED A VANILLA LATTE, YOUR FAVORITE. AND HE'S A LAWYER. - YOU ASKED A CUSTOMER WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING? - HE WAS FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION. LOOK, STOP WORRYING ABOUT MY BUSINESS ETIQUETTE AND LISTEN TO ME. HIS NAME IS MICHAEL, HE'S A LAWYER, AND HE ORDERED YOUR FAVORITE DRINK. THAT IS TWO BIG THINGS IN COMMON. - MARCIE, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BRIDE AND I'M THE MAID OF HONOR, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU GET TO CONTROL MY LIFE. IF ANYTHING, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ORGANIZING YOURS. [sighs] FINE, ONE DATE WITH MICHAEL THE LAWYER. - GREAT. - BUT THEN, THAT IS IT. - KAT, I JUST-- I WANT YOU TO HAVE A FULL LIFE. YOU DESERVE MORE THAN GREASY TAKEOUT AND 80 HOURS A WEEK IN AN OFFICE. YOU DESERVE SOMEBODY WONDERFUL WHO LOVES YOU-- BESIDES ME. - HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PRETEND TO BE MAD AT YOU WHEN YOU SAY NICE THINGS LIKE THAT LOOKING LIKE A PRINCESS? - [laughs] - MM--OH! OW. OW.

WHY? - WELL, I HAD ALL THESE IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO BE CREATIVE AT THE WEDDING SO THAT WE COULD DO BOTH, BUT RICK IS JUST-- - OKAY, OKAY, I'M SURE IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT. - YEAH. FORGET ABOUT THAT. HOW WAS YOUR DATE? - OH, IT WAS-- IT WAS A REALLY NICE NIGHT. - GOOD. I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL DORA. - OKAY. HOW ABOUT I GO ON A SECOND DATE, YOU DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF, AND WE FIND A SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEM? LET'S MAKE A LIST. - FINE. - MR. BARNWORTH ON LINE TWO.

MR. BARNWORTH? - THIS-- - MR. BARNWORTH? - ARE YOU RAISING YOUR VOICE AT ME? - HI. SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO RAISE MY VOICE. - KATHERINE, HE'S ASKING AT LEAST 30% LESS THAN THAT PROPERTY IS WORTH. - MR. BARNWORTH, I KNOW THAT. - WELL THEN, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? - THE PROBLEM IS IT'S MY JOB TO GET YOU WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF THIS SETTLEMENT, BUT YOU CAN EITHER HAVE IT FAST OR YOU CAN HAVE IT RIGHT. SO BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING YOU REGRET, MAY I PLEASE SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE A DAY TO THINK THINGS THROUGH BEFORE WE PROCEED? - ALL RIGHT, I GET IT, BUT I'M NOT SETTLING FOR THIS.

EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT. I WAS CURIOUS. CAN I JUST SAY, I THINK THAT IT WAS INCREDIBLY BRAVE OF YOU TO WRITE IT? I MEAN, IT'S DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO TELL SOMEONE HOW YOU FEEL, BUT TO TELL THE WHOLE WORLD? - WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE THAT MUCH, IT'S NOT BRAVE.

IF WE'RE MAKING CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT, I DON'T WANT THE CARS. - REALLY? - YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T DRIVE THEM. AND YOU LOVE THEM. - BUT THEY'RE ONLY CARS. I DON'T LOVE THEM. - AND I DON'T WANT THE POODLES. - COUNSELORS, DO YOU NEED MORE TIME WITH YOUR CLIENTS? - LUTHER HAS SLEPT AT MAX'S FEET EVERY NIGHT FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. I DON'T WANNA CHANGE THAT. - BUT LULU SLEPT AT YOUR FEET FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I CAN'T TAKE HER AWAY FROM YOU. - BUT WE CAN'T SPLIT THEM UP, MAX. THEY LOVE EACH OTHER. - BUT THEY FIGHT ALL THE TIME. - THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET EACH OTHER'S ATTENTION. THEY DON'T MEAN IT. I THINK SOMETIMES LULU FEELS THAT LUTHER CARES MORE ABOUT HIS RAWHIDE THAN HE DOES ABOUT HER. - SHE'D BE CRAZY TO THINK SUCH A THING. I THINK LUTHER DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO SAY-- I MEAN, SHOW HOW HE FEELS. - THAT'S ENOUGH. MR. AND MRS. BARNWORTH, THIS ISN'T MARRIAGE COUNSELING. IT'S A DIVORCE COURT, AND YOU ARE WASTING MY VALUABLE TIME. NOW, EITHER WE CONTINUE WITH THE DIVISION OF ASSETS RIGHT THIS MINUTE, OR I DISMISS THIS COURT AND WE RESCHEDULE AT A LATER DATE. OR NOT. DISMISSED. - UH, LORI? PLEASE HOLD MY CALLS. WELL, MR. BARNWORTH, THAT CERTAINLY WAS A FIRST. - I'M SORRY, KATHERINE. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T WIN THE CASE. I DON'T WANNA GET YOU IN TROUBLE. - HONESTLY, I'VE NEVER BEEN SO PLEASED TO DO A BAD JOB. - WELL, I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR THIS. - YOU DO? - YES. WHEN YOU SAID THAT A LOT OF COUPLES YOU SEE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FIRE LEFT, I REALIZED THAT I WAS ONLY DOING THOSE THINGS TO RILE MILLIE UP BECAUSE I MISSED THAT PASSION. SHE'S THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. THANK YOU. [ringing] - HELLO? - I LOST. - YOUR CASE? - NO, I-I FEEL LIKE I WON. - OKAY, THAT'S GREAT. - AND I PROBABLY WON'T MAKE PARTNER. - I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING. - AND I CAN'T DECIDE IF THIS IS THE BEST OR THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. - HEY, KATIE, SOMETHING URGENT JUST CAME UP, SO I'M GONNA-- I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK. - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT, BYE. - KATIE, HUH? KATIE? WHAT'S GOIN' ON? - YEAH, YEAH, KATIE. THAT PHONE CALL I JUST GOT WAS NUTS. YEAH, I-I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON WITH KATIE. [cell phone rings] - HI. - I MEAN, SHE'S ACTING ERRATIC, AND--AND-- - MICHAEL? - YEAH. - [laughs] WELL, DIDN'T YOU GUYS JUST GET BACK LIKE A WEEK AGO? - YOU KNOW, EVERY RELATIONSHIP NEEDS WORK. DATING KATIE IS WORK. - I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BROTHER, BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD GET MY ATTENTION. - YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT KATIE IS PURSUING ME FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH ME. - REALLY? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT? - I'M AT THE END OF THE LINE, MAN. - WHAT ABOUT YOU? HOW DO YOU FEEL? - I FEEL THAT TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE BEGINNING TO DATE EACH OTHER SHOULD LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING ONE ANOTHER, NOT DREAD IT. - I THINK YOU JUST ANSWERED YOURSELF. - [sighs] THERE. ALL DONE. - OKAY. - [laughs] - LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE SO IN LOVE, THEY KNOW THEY'RE MEANT TO BE WITH EACH OTHER. - AND THAT'S SAD SOMEHOW? - I THINK I'M JEALOUS. - OF RICK AND MARCIE GETTING MARRIED? I THOUGHT YOU AND MICHAEL WERE NEXT. - TOM, THAT'S NOT FUNNY. - I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST YOU WERE THE ONE MAKING FUN OF THIS STUFF. - I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE MYSELF. NOW I DON'T EVEN LOVE MY JOB ANYMORE. IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM, OR WHAT I WANT, OR WHO I WANT. - SOMETIMES, THE PERSON YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WITH IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, AND YOU GENUINELY DON'T REALIZE IT. I'M SORRY. [laughs] - NO, THAT'S OKAY. FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY, I HAVEN'T FELT COMPLETELY LOST. - GOOD, I'M GLAD. - ACTUALLY, IF I LEAVE NOW, I CAN STILL GET MANICURES WITH THE GIRLS. - GO. - OH, THANK YOU. [sighs] THANKS, TOM. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. - BYE, KATHERINE. [indistinct chatter] - JUST LET THEM DRY FOR TEN MINUTES. - HI. - PERFECT. - HI. - OH, YOU MADE IT. - LOOK, KAT'S HERE. - OH. - HI. HI, EVERYONE. - HONEY, I LOVE THOSE SHOES. - HI, DORA. - SO LOOK AT YOU. DO YOU HAVE NEWS FOR MISS DORA? - NO, I DON'T HAVE ANY NEWS FOR MISS DORA. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING FOR CERTAIN LAST NIGHT. I WAS TRYING TO BE OPEN. I WAS TRYING TO BELIEVE. IT JUST DIDN'T WORK. - WELL, DID YOU HAVE FUN ON YOUR DATE? - NO, I-I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE HAD FUN. - OH. WELL, NOW, YOU KNOW. - KNOW WHAT? - WHAT? - LOVE IS NOT JUST ROMANCE. IT IS NOT JUST HOLDING HANDS AND KISSING AND FLOWERS ON VALENTINE'S DAY. LOVE IS BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF AND WITH OTHERS ABOUT YOUR TRUE FEELINGS, NO MATTER HOW THINGS TURN OUT. - SHE'S SO RIGHT. - I GOTTA GO. - BUT WAIT, KAT, YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR NAILS DONE YET. ARE YOU OKAY? - YEAH. [laughs] - SHE KNOWS NOW. - [knocks on door] - HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - I LEFT YOU A VOICE MESSAGE. - OH, UM, YEAH. I WAS GONNA CALL YOU BACK. SORRY, THIS-- THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE JUSTIN. THIS IS KATIE. - HOW ARE YOU DOIN', KATIE? - I ACTUALLY KNOW WHO YOU ARE. - YOU DO? MICHAEL TALKED ABOUT ME? - UH, NO. - [clears throat] I JUST REMEMBERED I GOTTA GO CHECK ON THE QUARTERLIES. - SURE. [clears throat] SO... - SO... I DIDN'T COME HERE TO APOLOGIZE AGAIN. BUT I DID COME HERE TO BE HONEST. - OKAY. - I GOT PRETTY SWEPT UP IN THIS WHOLE MICHAELS IDEA. AND I TRIED TO MAKE YOU FIT INTO THAT, AND THAT'S UNFAIR TO YOU. MY WHOLE LIFE, WHEN IT CAME TO SCHOOL OR MY JOB, I ALWAYS WENT AFTER EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED WITHOUT HESITATION OR WORRY. - OF COURSE. LOOK AT YOUR CAREER. - WHY SHOULD LOVE BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY? I THINK IF I'M GONNA BE TRUE TO MYSELF, I NEED TO APPROACH LOVE WITH THE SAME KIND OF COMMITMENT AND PASSION AND NO FEAR OF FAILURE. - KATIE, IN EVERY RELATIONSHIP, I MEAN, THERE'S UPS AND DOWNS AND--AND-- - BUT IF WE'RE GONNA BE HONEST HERE, THE TRUTH IS THAT WE BOTH KNOW WE'RE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER. AND WITHOUT THAT THING, YOU KNOW, IT JUST FEELS... LIKE WORK. - [exhales] YOU'RE RIGHT. - I LEARNED THAT IN A NAIL SALON TODAY. - [laughs] - YOU TAKE CARE, OKAY? - YEAH, GOOD LUCK AT THE WEDDING. - THANKS. I MAY NEED IT. - AND NOW OUR MAID OF HONOR PROCEEDS LAST BEFORE THE BRIDE. LOVELY. LOVELY. PERHAPS JUST THE LITTLEST BIT FASTER, DEAR. AND NOW OUR MUSIC WILL CHANGE TO THE WEDDING MARCH, AND ALL OUR WONDERFUL FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL STAND AND AWAIT THE ARRIVAL OF OUR BEAUTIFUL BRIDE. AND ONCE MARCIE MAKES IT TO THE END OF THE AISLE, OUR MAID OF HONOR WILL TAKE HER BOUQUET. - KATHERINE. BOUQUET. - RIGHT. SORRY. - AND THAT IS WHY WE REHEARSE, EVERYONE. [laughter] - OH, ONE SEC. KAT. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE I WANT YOU TO MEET. THIS IS RICK'S COUSIN ANDY AND HIS WIFE CAROLINE. THIS IS MY BEST FRIEND AND MAID OF HONOR, KATHERINE. - IT'S SO GOOD TO MEET YOU. [laughs] UH--UH, TOM AND I HAVE SOME LAST-MINUTE MAID OF HONOR/BEST MAN BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO. EXCUSE ME. HI. - HEY. ARE YOU OKAY? - I'M FINE. CAN WE JUST HAVE A TALK IN PRIVATE? THANKS. - SURE. IS SOMETHING WRONG? - UM... UH... OH, WOW, I REALLY DIDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY, DID I? - SAY ABOUT WHAT? - ABOUT THE WEDDING. - DO WE HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO PLAN? - NO, NO, WE JUST-- WE JUST GET TO GO TO THE WEDDING NOW, AND I WAS WONDERING IF... YOU WANTED TO BE MY DATE. - BUT WHAT ABOUT MICHAEL? - MICHAEL IS A REALLY NICE GUY. BUT WE'VE REALIZED WE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PEOPLE NOW. AND SOMEBODY VERY WISE TOLD ME THAT SOMETIMES THE PERSON YOU'RE MEANT TO BE WITH IS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU GENUINELY DON'T REALIZE IT. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US THAT I'VE JUST BEEN TOO BLIND TO SEE, AND I KNOW I COULD NEVER REPLACE YOUR WIFE. [gasps] [joyful orchestration] ♪ - SHE KNOWS. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
