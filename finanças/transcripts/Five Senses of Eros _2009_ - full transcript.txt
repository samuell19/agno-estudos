Presented and distributed by Synergy Produced by Daisy Entertainment and Culture Cap Media Five Senses of Eros Why there? Why can't it be a romantic place? It's Friday night and the traffic is bumper to bumper. It had to be downtown during rush hour? So we could come up with excuses... ...for standing somebody up at the last minute? Hello? It's freezing. Why don't we pick a place to go? "We"? May I have your attention, please? A KTX bound for Busan at 7130... Hello? Yes, boss. I'm at the train station to go to Busan. I'll take care of it. Yes. Okay. The opening ceremony footage should be finished by today. I'll have KIM deal with it. We're moving to the reception after the opening ceremony. We might have issues with security. It's too far to walk, and too close to use vehicles. Beautiful legs. A buddy of mine got married recently. He met his wife on a place coming back... ...from a business trip in Tokyo. For those traveling alone... ...a seat number is like a lottery number. As soon as somebody sits next to you... ...you'll know what you won. A formal suit of good quality. The balance of black and brown. Her job must involve dealing with upscale customers. Shades on her head in winter... She doesn't care about what others think. Or she cares too much about how she looks. What arouses men the most? For some, it's long legs in sexy stockings. Or a firm ass in a tight skirt. For others, it's long fingers holding a pen. Or unpainted fingernails. Or the movement of eyes reading something. Shouldn't you know your SSN by heart? What? It's a business registration number. For tax purposes... On a business trip? Yes. To Busan. What am I doing? I tell my friends a conversation with girls... ...should always end with a question. You know what? Thanks for earlier. Where are you going? There you go. To Cheonan. Oh, I see. That's all I have to say? "Oh, I see"? Two coffees, please. I got this for you. Sorry. I don't drink coffee. Okay. Just one. We're arriving in Cheonan shortly. Already? Speed and romance never go together. Now it's time to check my lottery ticket. Be a man and go after her. Only the brave win the beauty. No, I'm a highly educated man. Think of the opportunity cost. If I'm late for the meeting, I'm screwed. Be reasonable. It was the reason that led Era of Romanticism. Excuse me? Excuse me? Forget it. What shall I do now? I thought you were going to Busan. When are you doing it? I mean going back to Seoul. Hold on. Hello? Freudian Slip. This is a perfect example. "When are you doing it?" I'm helpless. How embarrassing. I told you about that at the meeting. No. Hold on a second. What I meant to say is... Here's what. Give me a call when you know what to say. Are you there? Hungry? It's almost done. I hope you like it. Okay. It looks good. A marriage. It's a social consent for a couple to have sex. You're here. Yeah. You said you were busy. I've come for her food. I tried this wine in Italy after the film festival. Brunello di Montalcino. It's really good. Brunello? Do you like wine? No, I only drink Soju. - Tell me. - What? When will I have a nephew? Shut up and eat. It'll ruin her body. You're unbelievable. When will I have a sister-in-law? So you can slave her? Sure. Why not? Are you seeing anybody? No. I'm not... It tastes weird. Good for me. It's kind of flat. - It's okay. - No, it's not. I mean... There's no taste to it. Do you think it's the ingredients? Hello? Hello? Yes? Hold on a second. What I mean to say is... Here's what. Call me when you know what to say. Okay. What a ï¬‚op. Should I back down? Or what? What else can I do? Oh, the brave don't win the beauty. They just miss the train. No, give up. Don't go after her. Damn my body! It's moving on its own. Don't talk to her. Don't! Excuse me? Forget it. What shall I do now? If I wanna call you... ...when I know what to say. I need your number. Wow, it worked. A curator? I don't know if you remember me. We met on a train. And you gave me your number. Sorry I didn't... Why is he out there? It's cold. Let me tell him. In front of Galleria Dept. Store? Which one? It has two buildings. All right. Okay. Hello? Hello? It's freezing. Why don't we pick a place to go? "Well begun is half done." Such a romantic saying. Do you like wine? Do I like wine? I love it. Which one do you like? Pick one. Something not too dry. The only wine that I know is... Do you have Brunello from Italy? We do have it, but it's a bit pricey. Recommend me something else quickly. Can I recommend something else? Sure. Try Rene Barbier. It's good. And on sale. Damn it. You had to say that? Brunello, please. Filled the glass too much and drank it too quickly. Bull made sure I kept my pinky lifted... ...when I held the glass. What did you go to Busan for? An IOC meeting will be held there next month. What's important here is... ...how to make my job sound more interesting... ...instead of boring her with what I really do. Who I am is less important than how she views me. My ego might feel betrayed... ...as its existence is completely denied... ...by the untruthful master. What a philosophical night. What show are you working on? A photographer named Blare Kitchener. I don't think you know him. A chance! Oh, he focuses on human relationships... ...in pure and innocent state... ...without any images covering them? No? Am I wrong? No, you're not. But I could tell you just memorized it. Frankly... I know nothing about a modern art. I know you got that from our website. I wrote it. God, I got caught red-handed. He does models in ads or magazines... ...without any accessories worn on them. Just their faces. So people can see them for what they are. To save the human nature... That's right. You're good. Should we try it? What? My favorite season is summer. Ding-dong-dang- It's my turn. My favorite color is red. Your tie is red. So is your muffler. I don't really like red. But a red tie for a suit is often an easy choice. I prefer Korean food to pastas. I prefer dramas to action flicks. I would choose work over love. I like her lips. Neither too fat nor thin. I... I fell in love at hello on a train. Ditto. I like steamed crabs. I don't like them. My mom always made a crab stew. I like it that way. Either way, it's crabs. I Still don't like it. Al right. Let's go somewhere else. Come on. - Did you like the wine? - Absolutely. Hey. Me? I'm on a date. My colleague is in Amsterdam on business. A computer file she had had been broken. It won't take long. Amsterdam... What a lovely town. If she were in New York... ...she might not have asked her for help. I'm out of wine. ls cognac ok? It doesn't matter. A good view, isn't it? My friend and I rented it for a studio. After she got married, I kept it for myself. Give me 30 minutes. Don't mind me. Go ahead. I'm sorry. She puts her hair in a bun and starts working. He looks out the window, drinking cognac. Watching the city lit with colorful lights... ...he sees her reflection in the window. What would be happening in other parts of the city? Meeting somebody... Falling in love... Feeling comfortable... Falling asleep... Falling asleep... Cognac is quite strong. As gently as possible. Not too much tongue. Those rules mean nothing at this moment. What will this kiss lead to? No answer is needed. I just kiss. Therefore I am. Two people being one... If it's her that I like... ...not sex itself, ...it can be called love. I like her love handle. That! have my hands on it is a sign of love. We're exploring each other through the five senses. A human relationship in its pure state... ...without any images covering it. What a philosophical night. I can'! believe what I did. A stranger is asleep in my bed. Was I too aggressive? Look at this chiseled face. So handsome. And cute. A goatee grew overnight. His beautiful voice comes from here? He's sleeping as if nothing happened. Can he be thinking what I'm thinking? Me, I'm Here "ye-um? I'm home, Hye-lim. Is she in the room? Hye-lim? All the lights are on. Did she go out? Hye-lim? I missed you! How are you, babe? Let me dry your hair. Turn around. Like this. We shouldn't. Okay. Put it down a bit. - Stop it. - You're so adorable. Okay, okay. When do you find me sexy? When you're in your birthday suit. When are you happy? When you hold me in your birthday suit. I wanna do it. I wanna do it all the way. No. Hye-lim, look at me. The doctor said we shouldn't. You know that. For over 4 days? How much do I get for the surgery? I'll call you back when the document is ready. Okay. bye. "ye-um? Hey-lim? Are you here? Hye-lim? Hye-lim? There you are. Why'd you stop looking for me? You won't look for me anymore? Hye-lim? Hye-lim? Where is she? Hye-lim? There you are. You'll be okay. Don't be scared. Wanna take your PJs? I won't need them. It feels as if we were going on a trip. I'll take this. What about the lipstick? I won't be able to shower, and I don't wanna stink. Throw in your cologne, too. So I can smell it when I miss you. I'll be right by you. Don't worry. Let's go. Hye-lim? Won-sik, how are you? No. It's okay. I should've called you. Sure, I'm fine. No. I had her cremated. Okay, I'll stay in touch. Okay. bye. What's wrong? Damn it! I'm sorry. - Cut it. - Cut! Let's redo it. You strangled me! I'm sorry. Are you okay? Mi-jin was too nervous. Let's redo the scene. I'm so sorry. I'll do better. Let's redo it. Why'd you get up? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're my sister. How could you do this to me? How-Z? You killed me and stole my husband! Please, forgive me. I was blinded by lust. Don't kill me. Please! Don't kill me. Cut. Look real. Real... I was blinded by lust. Don't kill me. Please! Cut. We're redoing it. Why? I thought it was good. That's... What the hell is this? Nobody messed up this time! Mi-jin's cry was off. And the guy moved. The corpse isn't supposed to... Calm down. We're almost done. He's an internationally recognized director. He must have reasons. Reasons my ass! Teach her how to act! Take 31. Forgive me. I was blinded by lust. Don't kill me. Please! Cut. My gown! Let's do it again. We're doing another take! I need a break. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry." That's all you have to say. Get the room tone. We're getting the room tone. Stay still. I'm sorry. Mi-jin is just nervous. Go easy on her. How long have you been in this business? About 15 years. It's about time you should be ripe. What? You don't know how to deal with a director. What are you saying? Didn't you see the way he looks at her? It's so obvious. He keeps finding fault with her to get her attention. You fix that, and everything's good. It's the balance of Yin and Yang. Don't I miss an unripe guy tonight. Get out. I'm getting changed. To kill or not to kill... Cut. - To kill or not to kill... - Cut. To kill or not to kill... Cut. - To kill... - Cut. - Not to kill... - Cut. That's the question... Cut. - That is... - Action! Not to kill... Cut. That's the question. To kill or not to kill... Cut. To kill or not to kill, that is the question. Cut. To kill or not to kill... Come on, it stinks! Take 127. Action! To kill or not to kill, that's is the question. Cut. I know it' hard. No. Enough for today. Let me try again. We have other scenes to shoot. AD? Let's take a break. BONG? Let's take a break. BONG? I got this for you. - No thanks. - It's good for you. Can you give my niece your autograph? My autograph? Your name? - It's JUNG Se-eun. - He's not in a good mood. Thanks. BONG? Do you drink? Why don't we go out tonight? Your birthday was the day before, right? I got this but never had a chance to give you. Here. You shouldn't have... It's a scarf. Let me put it on you. A mirror! What do you think? I like the color and design. Kuty 33 is a popular brand? It's top of the line. Wear it until we crank up. - AD? - Yes? Let's call it a day. Wrap it up. We're done for the night! Being polite won't get you anywhere. It's okay. Sit down. How long have you been acting? About 5 years since college. I've seen so many girls come and go. They had nothing but looks. What? They were after glamour... ...but didn't want any pain that came with it.. Mi-jin has looks and a good body. You liked her when we cast her. You should know better. Looks don't do tricks in this business. Teach her. Give her your energy. We'd appreciate it. I'll do anything. I can't quit now. Please! Thank you. God... What are you thankful for? I didn't say yes. Hwa-ran, Please, teach her. Please, teach me. Okay, fine. Step 1. Feel for yourself how attractive you are. Be confident that you're sexy and charming. Rid yourself of a loser attitude. The past is gone. What counts is today. You're gonna turn into a sexy icon. Let your hair loose. Be revealing enough. It will spark men's secret desire. Eye contact matters the most. Look your prey straight in the eyes. Now you're reborn. Cast a killing glance. No, make it sexier. Be confident. That's it. Cheers. Let me make... Bottom's up. Mi-jin? I thought you'd be bored with me. Mi-jin, sit beside him. Come on, let's drink. Bottom's up! I know you had a long day. - No. - Oh, I forgot I had a meeting. You can sing and talk. Have some fun. Don't mind the bill. It's on me. Mi-jin? Yes? What do you want? We did that take 33 times because of your cry. Try it for me. I guess we'll be shooting all day tomorrow. Give it some emotion this time. It's not about screaming. No, make it sadder. Think of yourself as an alien. He's obsessed with a ghost cry. After 30 shots, that's all they did. He must be either gay or impotent. Give me your energy. Please... I killed them both and became human. Cut! Okay! Mi-jin, that was good. Let's do another take. I can do better. I'm sorry we're cranking up today. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. I killed them both and became human. Cut! Okay. We're done. Dinner is at 6. Good job, guys! BONG? Mi-jin. I got little something for you. You shouldn't have... You've come a long way. I guess our practice at Karaoke paid off. I was so embarrassed then. Quite an experience for me though. BONG... Please. You're warm. Mi-jin, I love you. BONG... The movie isn't done yet. It needs editing. Mi-jin... How do you feel about your new life? It's so refreshing. Let's have a party of our own. Sure. Why not? Why'd you choose me? You were so helpless like myself long ago. When were you chosen? 100 years ago. I couldn't be more confident now. Who will do the editing? An assistant director. He's good. Here, cheers. Cheers. Didn't it hurt? I was in so much pain the first time. Not really. I was drunk. Your blood was so fresh. BONG'S blood was a bit salty. You'll get used to it. How old are you? 120. Age is just a number. It's delicious. That part is good for your skin. What if I get hooked and crave it? Control yourself. But you must eat it once every 2 years. Cause there are many men who need to go. Jane... Jane... Don't talk. In the End is My Beginning Remember me? My daughter tutored you in high school. I even cooked for you. How dare you show up here! Stop it. You're nothing but a whore. Get out of here! Honey? Get up. Breakfast is ready. Let me sleep some more. Come on. Let's eat together. You know we can't. Why not? I'm dead. Remember? It's a plant. "Water it and what you need will grow." What are you doing here? How'd you get in? I've been here for a while. Get out of here. Now! No point kicking me out. Cause I'll be back. What's going on here? Did you call her? Get out. - No. - Now. Please. Get out. Let me stay here. I'll do anything. Shut up and leave. I'm begging you. Let me stay. - Please... - Get out! Let me stay. Let me stay... Please. Why don't you? No way. Give her a break. I said no! Let me stay. Please. Let her or I'll leave. Hi. You can't get over him? Searching for his memories... It's not that. Save it. That's what you're here for, isn't it? I won't touch his things if it bothers you. You sure? Change into that. It'll bring back vivid memories of him. You're killing me. Make it tighter. Am I pretty? You're still so pretty. What'd you do after high school? A lot of things. I delivered. I cleaned. I gave manicures. Then I acted in a few plays. I did magic, too. You know what you're best at. Like what? Recognize this? You could've been a porn star. You were a slut back in school days. I wasn't. You know that. I thought I did. Eat it. Eat it all. So you can cherish such a precious memory. It's some sight to see. Are you OK? I'm fine. Come in. Hi. She's just a maid. Don't mind her. Draw the tub for us. Let's go. Let's go! Stop it. Hey! Come up here. What this is for? You... favor? Tie me. You are for real? Tie me up. What are you doing? Tie me like he tied you. Tighter. Come on. Tighter. Oh, come on. Are you sure you want... Tighter! Tighter! Come on! You can do better! Tie me tighter. Make it tighter. Tighter. - I'm get going... - Where are you going? Get back here! It's no fun. Oh God... What's wrong with me? What's that? In case I couldn't stand this punishment. Jung-ha... It feels weird. What? A wife and a lover celebrating his birthday together. What a lucky bastard. Leave now. What? Leave. Stop saying that. I'd rather kill myself. I mean it. It started raining that day unexpectedly. All my dad did was magic. So I didn't expect him to pick me up. You stole me an umbrella from a store. Right then, a raindrop... It fell on your forehead like a God's voice. And it exploded over your eyebrows. So did my heart. If I could get near you... ...I would've done worse -than seducing him. - That's enough. He might hear you. Don't make him upset on his birthday. When we first kissed... Stop it. I don't remember. My tongue... When it got into your mouth... You told me you heard a bell ringing. Was it the same when you kissed Jane? Yes. You truly loved him. Tie me up. Stop. I said stop. Am I not better than him? You don't arouse me. Stop it, will you? Can't you see? I'm you, Jung-ha. Awake? You can leave now. Thanks. I have to ask you. Yes? Did you know? Naru didn't... I know. Be good. Hi. Hey! You're 30 minutes late. Why the hell are you late? God... Did it hurt? You're buying. Excuse me? You haven't changed. You either. We'll have fun today. Just like we did. Just today? Can't a girl eat? I've never seen a girl eating like a pig. The beautiful eat a lot. Here, eat some. You won't get it? Wanna see something funny? What about Su-jung? Going together? We will. If she decides to. Is that why we're doing this? I just wanted to know how she feels about me. What about you? I wanted to make sure, too. Make sure what? What Ji-woon means to me. I know you like him. What about him? He will find out today. I wonder how it will end. You've done that before. I know. I'll do more today. What else are you gonna show me? Show you? I don't think so. I'm sleeping with him today. You suck in bed. He's way better. You're crazy. You think so? You don't think you are? How long have you been with an art teacher? Beats me. I can't remember. I just can't understand you. What? Can you understand what we're doing then? Who is it? It's Yoon-jung. She's sounding you out. I don't know. I don't know. This is pathetic. Why'd you suggest this? You're a fool. If this will break you up, you're not meant to be together. So naive. What'd he say? "Do as you please." He doesn't mean it. He's just pretending to be cool. Like you? I know how I feel about Su-jung. What about her? Tell me. ls Se-eun ok with this? How'd you guys HOOK UP? Sang-min. Do you wanna... ...kiss me? What are you trying to pull? See you tomorrow at school. I can't believe he did that. He hasn't called you? By the way, where are we going? We have a thing to do. We do? What? You Okay? Huh? Yes. I like it better with Ji-woon. Of course. He's your boyfriend. I'm leaving. Okay. Should I walk you? No, it's okay. Yoon-jung, we should take a picture. Oh, right. Wait, wait. What? Tell me honestly. What? Is this your revenge against Sang-min? You don't wanna do it? No, I wanna do it. You like being with me? You're no different. "Do as you please"? That's me? Let me see. It's you. Let me draw you. Don't look. - What is this? - Wait. You're making it worse. Fix mine then. - Long legs... - Make them longer. Like this... - Why? - Draw it again. Stop it. You're so good. Don't let it go to your head. I won't let you win this time. Wait. Let me gather my Ki. Let's go. Thanks. No way. You're going down. I wish I could be cool about this. I don't think I can see you again. Ji-woon. Let's not do it again. Yesterday, I couldn't... You're not supposed to tell me. Right. I love you. Ditto. You! "Do as you please"? What was that? Get back here! Ji-woon! I love you, Yoon-jung!
