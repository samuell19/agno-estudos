55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90. One, two, three, four, five, 95. Assen. Not here to meet you, Bronic? She's trying to get rid of the boyfriend! Maybe she's still making the bed! You're on! You're right on! One more pair, catch him now! - Pick her up! - Catch him with... Who the hell are you? Well, who are you? What are you doing here? - My girl lives here. - She doesn't live here now! l do! - Just a minute... - Beat it! l want to get dressed. l pay the rent for this room. - So do l. Weekly and in cash! - This is quite mysterious. Talk to the doctor about it. He's the landlord, remember? l remember. My dear Korchinsky, when did you get back? Where's Anya? Where's she gone? - She left here. - Why? There was some pecuniary embarrassment. - What is it? - No money. - But that's not possible. l sent her money every place we stopped. For our home. Where has she gone? What's her address? Come on, tell me. You must know. All l know is she left here owing me two weeks' rent. You liar. That's not why she left, is it? l know you. lf l find out you've been... Be so good as to remove your hand from my jacket. Here you are, Mr Ellis. Look. l've been sending her money all the time. lf you sent on my letters, you must know her address. Come on. Tell me what you want. Don't take that tone with me. lf you're interested in this girl, perhaps you can settle her debts. So. There's some here. Only what l'm owed. You can see the bills if you like. 4 for the rent, 1.10 for gas, 1 for electricity, various other smaller items. All right. Say a fiver. Thank you. - Well... l'm sorry about... - That's all right. Bye. Bronic, l want to give you a word of advice. And, believe me, it is from a friend. Don't let your emotions run your life. Sometimes it isn't worth it. Hold on. You're not playing with us. - Yes, l am! - Not enough to do on you. - Why not? - You haven't got a gun, that's why. - She's not got a gun! - Yes, l have. Look. Call that a gun? lt's a bare wood. Get out of it, Gillie. Go back to London. Go on, scram! - l got a bomb! - A bomb? Cowboys don't use bombs! Hey! Give that back! lt's mine. - Give it back! Give it back! - Go on. Clear off. - Stop it. You must never hit a lady. - l'm not a lady! Give her back the bomb. Go on! Give it to her! Now clear off and leave her alone! Hey! Any of you kids know where is Clanwis Court? What, mister? - Clanwis Court. - Never heard of it. lt's somewhere here. Here. Oh. ''Clan-wis'' Court. Gillie will show you. She lives there. Thank you. Oh! You forgot something. Thanks. Um... Do you know where that is? - lt's Clanwis Court. - Oh. That's where l live. lt's that house. Thank you very much, mademoiselle. Anechka! Anechka. Anya. Anya. (Speaks Polish) (Speaking Polish) You're late. You bad girl. Wherever have you been? - Couldn't get served. Butcher's closed. - You've been playing in the streets again. No, l haven't, Auntie. Honest. l came straight home. There was a fire in Davies Street. l only stopped a minute. - Put the change on the table. - There weren't no change. - Oh come on Gillie. None of that. - He didn't give me none, Auntie - What have you been up to now? - Nothing, Auntie. Don't touch that. This is Mrs Potter's. Well? l'm waiting. Sausages are one and nine a half. l gave you two and six. - Where's the ninepence? - l dropped it. lt wasn't my fault. A great big lady with a basket bumped into me, knocked it out of my hand. - Fell down the drain, l dare say? - Yes. That's what took me so long, hunting for it. Butcher gave you this? Steal from your own, would you? All my life is spent in struggling to scrimp together a few pennies to bring you up decent and this is how you repay me. A thief at your age, ended up in jail, that's what'll happen to you, mark my words. You're old enough to know right from wrong by now. I should hope so. Let's have the truth for once. Why did you do it? They wouldn't let me play with them. They've all got proper cap pistols. And Greenette, she got a new cowboy outfit for her birthday. Sure l don't know what next. Little girls wanting to play with guns and bombs and dress up like gangsters. - Here. - Thanks, Auntie. - Take these pants down to Mr Williams and tell him it's two shillings. - Mm-hmm Be careful now. - Boo! - Oh! You little devil. - Mind those trousers now. - lt's two bob, Auntie says. Where's your manners? Did anyone ever tell you to say please? - Sorry, Mrs Williams. - Tell her l'll pay her next week. - OK Well, what is it? No one ever tell you to say thank you? Some people got no manners. Oh, you wicked girl! You've made Mr Williams cut himself! Now you have. Oh, dear. Cut his self bad? Cut his bleedin' head off?! Ooh, you... Wait till he gets his hands on you. Your backside'll be cut then! (Talking Polish) l came here to ask you to marry me. Can't you understand? But you make me say it - l don't want to see you! l don't want you! l don't want you! Anya... Look, Anya, l'm sorry l'm away so long. lt's the ships. l don't write so good. You know l don't write. But you got the money, didn't you? Came regular, didn't it? Regular? Oh, yes! Regular like you pay a cook! - l'm glad you're so grateful. - Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! ls that grateful enough?! Just because you helped me once, is that a life sentence? This is all-shed life by the knee. l'm not an animal for a little boy to keep in a cage. l'm a woman, a woman with a heart and a body which is my own to give how l like, when l like! l'd rather be back in that bloody camp than have this year again. This waiting, waiting, never knowing. Anechka. l'm finished with the sea. l tell you, really l am. lt's all over. l'm never going back to the sea. l'm staying here with you. l promise you. l swear it. We are going to get married. Married, you hear? Married. Married would be terrible. Worse. Plenty of love for a few days, all happy, smiling. Then you'd see a ship. You can't help it, it's a madness. The sea gets in here! You've got a man, haven't you? You've got another one, haven't you? Haven't you?! - Yes! l have! - Who is it? Who is it? You tell me! I doubt! Not a sailor! I tell you. Not a dirty sailor! He's a wonderful man. Wonderful! He's a gentleman! A gentleman! (Speaks Polish) You bitch! You bitch! Bitch! - Bitch! - Yes! Bitch. That's exactly it. Well your little bitch has had enough of crawling on its stomach, crawling when you whistle, crawling up shed blood, dying while should not yet. You call it love, l call it something else. I have watched you. You're thinking only one thing. ''What a wonderful strong man is Bronislav Korchinsky!'' Little sailor boys shouldn't have women to play with. But go out and sleep with the sea! Now get out! Get out! Go, go! Get out! (Shouting in Polish) Bronic. Anya. l'm sick of your tricks, my girl. Hand over those caps. Hear what I'm saying? l want those caps. Come on, come on, l'm waiting. These are confiscated. Any more troubles from you and you'll go to jail. You stupid little! Look where you're going. Anya. Anya. - Got my two shillings? - Two shillings? Mr Williams' trousers. Oh. She wouldn't pay. Said she'd pay next week. Gillie, l know when something's wrong. What is it? - It's old Williams - he pinched my bomb. - ls that all? All right, all right. l'm coming. Hello? Yes. Yes. Who? Well, she's out. Can l take a message? Oh, all right then. Hang on. Miss Haluba? Miss Haluba? Mr Williams! Mr Williams, come quickly! - Come quickly, Mr Williams! - What is it, Mrs Parry? - Mrs Parry, what's the matter? - Mr Williams! - He's gone on duty. - Something's happened to that woman. l think she's dead. She's been murdered. Her room's in a terrible state. - l'll try and catch George up. - l'll come with you. l'm Superintendent Graham. Can l come in? Yes. - You're Mrs Phillips? - Yes. l'm in charge of this case upstairs. l understand that you knew Miss Haluba pretty well, didn't you? You say I knew her at all on saying ''Good morning''? You've notices perhaps she had many visitors? l've more to do with my time than spending it nosing into other people's affairs. l'm sure. l just thought, as her neighbour, you, you might know something about her habits. I'm not going to speak ill of the dead.. Whatever she's done wrong, she's paid for now. lt's not for us to judge, is it? - Did you go out at all this morning? - No. Somewhere around 12:30 a gun was fired upstairs. Did you hear it? l may have done. There were several bangs. l thought it was Gillie with that toy. Toy? What toy? - Where's that thing, Gillie? - l've got none. They took it. l've got it here, sir. lf you put two or three caps at once in that, it makes a noise exactly like a revolver shot. Gillie, come here a minute. - So you were playing with this, this morning? - I'll say she was, sir, until l got it off her. - After giving a due warning. - Thank you, Williams. There was no chance to hear a shot with all that racket going on. Sit down, Gillie. Sit down. Sit down. Don't be nervous. l want to ask you a few simple questions. Superintendent, there's a wedding at St Mary's and Gillie's in the choir. It's late already. l won't be a moment. Now then, Gillie. ln all this house full of people, there's only one person who could have known for certain the difference between this little lead bomb exploding and the shots that were fired. Now that person's you, isn't it, Gillie? - Yes. - Uh-huh. - Did you hear a shot? - Yes. How many shots did you hear? Several. Where were you at the time? - On the stairs. - Uh-huh. Did you see anybody come out of number four? The Polish lady's flat? Who was it? A man? Mm. What did he look like? Can you describe him to us? Now come on, speak up! And don't go telling the superintendent none of your stories or you'll find yourself in real trouble. Proper little liar she is. l'll thank you Mr Williams not to call the child names. You were going to tell us what the man looked like. - He just looked ordinary. - Was he dark or fair? - Fairish. - Fat? Fat? Well, fattish. - Was he tall or short? - Tallish. How was he dressed? Just in ordinary sort of clothes. A bit like yours. - Did he have a hat? - Mm. Then how do you know he was fair? He had it in his hand in the house. - You think you'd recognize him if you saw him again? - Yes, l think so. Gracious. Look at the time. She should be in the church by now. Let's see now. He was fattish, fairish, tallish, ordinaryish. Thank you, Gillie. You've been a real help. Gillie, come here. Let me comb your hair. There's no time to change or anything. You'll have to go as you are. There. Now run along. God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve and keep you. The Lord mercifully with His favour look upon you and so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace... that ye may so live together in this life that in the world to come, ye may have life everlasting. - Amen. - Amen. Almighty God, who at the beginning did create our first parents, Adam and Eve, and did sanctify and join them together in marriage, pour upon you the riches of His grace, sanctify and bless you that ye may please Him both in body and soul and live together in holy love until your lives end.

What have you to say for yourself? 14 and a half minutes late. Wasn't my fault, Mr. Seymour. l had to help the police with a murder. Stop telling lies in God's house. - But Mr Seymour... - l'm not warning you again. You disgraced the whole choir breaking down in your solo. l don't know what to say to the vicar. Next time you misbehave during a service will be the last! Do you understand? Yes, sir. - Are you listening? - Yes, sir. Oh, lvor, l'd like to have a chat with you about next Sunday's service. - Stick 'em up! - Drop that gun. Don't move! l've got you covered! lt's loaded. Come any nearer and l'll shoot! l mean it. Put your hands up! Go on, go on! Put 'em up. Now turn round. Now what? What's the big idea? To keep me here all night? You're gonna get pretty tired. No, l won't! My dad's waiting for me. When l don't come back he'll send the police and they'll take you away. - What have l done? - l know what you've done. l saw you. What are you talking about? l was watching through the letter box. Don't! Don't kill me! l won't tell! I swear I won't. lt was a lie about my father and the police! What did you see? You tell me what you saw! Why were you spying on me? l wasn't. l was only looking. l didn't mean to spy. - Who did you tell? - No one. No one, honest. - Did you tell your father? - No, not even the police. - What did you tell them? - That l saw a man. - But l never said it was you. Truly I didn't! - What do you mean you never said it was me? l said it was a different man not like you. Why did you tell them the wrong way?! Eh? l wanted that gun. Does anyone, anyone else know you've got it? Course not. How could they? Please... can l go home now? - Please can l go home now? - No. What you gonna do? You ought to get away from here. Quick. Oughtn't ya? Get a boat maybe. Go some place a long way off. There's lot of boats go from Cardiff. Then, once you were away, you wouldn't need to bother about me. You've got the gun. You could shoot your way out. You could. l've seen them do it. Saw a man once, shot a girl. The cops were all round the house and they couldn't get him 'cos he had a Tommy gun which he kept firing through the window at 'em. (Speaks Polish) Holy Mother, what l did, l... l didn't know... what l'm doing. Why did you do it? You know, shoot her? l got angry. - Like a madman. - Why? Because... Oh, l don't know. Because l love her too much maybe. l come back to marry her and then she said... Just like that. ''l don't want you any more.'' Why didn't she want you any more? She'd got someone else. A gentleman. Got more cash, l suppose. l know. lt's that man with the car. Horrid man. Always hanging around our place. You should have shot him instead. - l didn't want to shoot any one. - But it was his fault! l'll tell you another thing. He's got another wife as well. All my life l've been at sea. All my life l've been trying to get away from the sea. Ah, it never worked out. What's wrong with the sea? l love it. Why not tell them the whole thing? Nobody in our street will blame you. They said she gave our place a bad name. Anyway, auntie says it's better to be dead if you're so wicked. Shut up, will you? l dried up in my solo. The nice bit too. / Yea, thou l walk / ln death's dark vale / Yet will l fear no ill / For thou art with me / And thy rod / And staff me comfort still / - Good voice, ain't l? - You've got a terrible voice. How did they ever let you into the choir? Coo, l'm starving. Hear it rumbling? What are you gonna do? Well... Find a ship. Back to the sea. l always wanted to go to sea. - Did you? - Mm. And would you like to work on a ship? Yeah! Could l? - Of course. - Would you take me? Well, er... l might. Would you? We could go round the world together and you'll forget all this. - All right. l'll take you. - Honestly? But there'll be no time to go home. You got to stay with me. That doesn't matter. But you do promise to take me with you? Sure l promise. Yeah, l promise. But wait a minute, what will your father say? l haven't got a father. l live with my auntie. But she doesn't care. - Sometimes l stay out all night. - You tell a lot of lies, don't you? Me?! All right. Let's find a ship right away. l found it in his trouser pocket, when I was turning out his things. l thought l'd better tell you, sir. Yes. Good. Come on, old chap. Rub that sleep out of your eyes. - Who are you? - l'm a policeman. Sorry to wake you up but this is important. Where'd you get this? Didn't do anything wrong. Fair trade. Swapped it with Gillie Evans in church. Ask Mrs Phillips to come in which is out in the hall. - You swapped it. Was it a good swap? - Not bad. - Some choc and a Dinky. - Not bad. - l wonder where Gillie got it. - Didn't ask her. - Hello, Mrs Phillips. Gillie up? - She's not in yet. - lt's a bit late, isn't it? - Yes, l suppose so. She's always out late causing trouble, got no sense of right not wrong. - Probably she's still playing with her new gun. - Gillie hasn't got a gun. She has. My bullet came from her gun. - He's half asleep. He's talking nonsense. - What sort of gun was it? lt was a lovely gun. A real gun. Well, what are we going to do? You've got to find her. We'll find her, Mrs Phillips. lt'll be all right. lt'll be all right, he says! A fat lot of good the police are. We've got one in the house, a murder's done under his nose and here's a child got hold of a gun they even don't know where she is! We'll find her! (Man) / lf you want to be happy and live a king's life / Never make a pretty woman your wife / lf you want to be happy and live a king's life / Never make a pretty woman your wife / All you gotta do is just what l say / And you will be jolly, merry and gay / Therefore from a logical point of view / Better love a woman uglier than you (Woman) / A pretty woman makes her husband look small / And very often cause his down fall / Soon as she's married him and then she starts / To do the things that will ache your heart / And when you think she belongs to you / She will be calling somebody else... / - Now wait here and don't talk to anyone. - Why? l'm going into the pub to find out about our ship and find some food for your tummy. - You sure it's safe? - Oh, sure. Remember, don't talk to anyone. 'Walter seems to have woken up at last. lt's a bit too late. 'They're both wrapped up together. 'There goes the bell for the end of the fifth round. 'That was the lrishman's round.' 'We are interrupting this programme to bring you a police message. 'Missing from her home in Newtown is Gillian Evans, aged 11. 'Fair hair, wearing dark-blue jersey and jeans. 'She was last seen in St Mary's Church Beard Street at 2:30pm today. 'She is in possession of a revolver which is believed to be loaded. 'Will anyone who has knowledge of her whereabouts 'please communicate with Cardiff City police... ' 'Here we are for round six... ' Hey, you! 'He goes straight in with both hands. 'Left and right on Walters' head. 'Another, a left hook, and another right by O'Malley! A beauty! 'Just below the heart. Which really hurts. 'The Welsh boy's groggy, he's in bad trouble.' Shut up. How did the police know you've got the gun? l heard it on the radio. Every cop in this town is after you. How the hell do they know it?! lt must be Dal Parry. l swapped him a bullet. He must have told on me. - Who is that? Who is he? - Just a friend of mine. Come on. Why did you lie to me? Why do you always lie? l wouldn't if you didn't shout at me. You frighten me. lt's then l tell lies. - l'm sorry. - That's all right. But if you want me to help you, no more lies, huh? Friends don't lie to each other. l never do lie to my friends. - Got a ship? - Hm? Yeah. Sure. - We're lucky. - Are we gonna board her now? No. No, we can't tonight. lt sails tomorrow. We have to hide up somewhere... tonight. l know a wonderful place to hide. Quite near here. Up in the hills. We went there for last year's outing. l lost my Wellington in the stream. Eight! Nine! Out! Colm Hardy of Dublin has knocked out Ben Walters of Cardiff. Now l hand you over to David for his comments on the fight. Thank you, Bob. There's no doubt that the better man won. Walters was beaten in the fifth round by a terrific blow over the heart... - Hello. - Good evening, Mr Barclay. l never forget a face. lt's the Superintendent himself. Isn't it? Well, well. Long time no see. What can l do for you? Oh, l need a drink. Ever tried a 35-minute nonstop spiel? lt's hell. Care to join me? - No, thank you. - You take in the fight? That's the finish of our Ben. Sad hearts in Tiger Bay tonight. Mr Barclay, l'm here to make some inquiries about a Miss Haluba. - Oh, ya? - When did you see her last? That's an odd question, isn't it? She was found dead in her flat this afternoon. What? Good heavens. How awful. What was it, suicide? You were going to tell me when you saw her last? - l can't remember that off hand. - You didn't see her today? Today? l've hardly had time to breathe. l just managed to snatch lunch with old Charlie Adams and then this. - l see. - What is all this mystery, old boy? Surely l'm well known enough to be treated like a responsible citizen? Mr Barclay, at this stage, even the most responsible citizens sometimes have to be kept in the dark. Yes, it's alright. But if l knew what was going on, l might be able to help. Good night. Thank you, Mr Barclay. You've been most helpful. (Talk Polish) - What's that? - lt's Polish. lt means ''get up''. Get up. lt's time for breakfast. All four shots were fired from that gun. Here's the sequence for it. Looks as though you may be right. We'd better have a chat with Mr Barclay. - l want to see the Super. Graham. - Yes, sir. l won't give a moment. - What's the game, the same? Christine bringing us a load of junk. - l've just told you... Oh don't give me that stuff. You keep it for the paying customers. - Look you've had something out of this. What was it? - That's Typical! l just try to help and he calls me a bloody thief. Oh, shut up. lt's too early. All right, Christine. Push off. On the Chief Constable's behalf, thank you for your cooperation. - Yes? - Oh, l've got a Mr... - Barclay. - Barclay. ...Barclay to see you, sir. - Send him in. Barclay. Very obliging of him. Mr Barclay, sir. - Come in, Mr Barclay. Good morning. - Good morning. - Sit down, please. - Thank you. - Cup of tea? - No, thank you. - Coffee? - No. - Well, how about a cigarette? - Yes. Thank you. Now then what can we do for you? What I got something to tell you: l think l may be able to help you in this murder case - Anya Haluba. I think you ought to know l left a gun in her flat. That the one? Go on, pick it up. lt's not loaded. And just have a good look at it and tell me if it's yours, will you? - Yes. Yes, it is. - Thank you. Now on your original application for a fire arms certificate, you stated that you needed the revolver for... ''amateur theatrical productions''. Was that why it was in Miss Haluba's room? Of course not. Then would you tell me how the gun came to be there? Um that's something not easy to. I'm innocent. lf the newspapers got hold of it- you know what they are - they'd tear me to pieces. You know l'm a married man. ln a job like mine, l'd be finished. You see, oh boy, my relations with Anya... Mr Barclay. We are aware of the, er... situation. Black, naked savages with knives in their mouth. - Cannibals? - Man-eaters! There l stood. Unarmed. Alone. And l faced them with nothing but my bare fist. And they come closer and closer and suddenly they rushed at me, ''Oo-oo-oo!'' ln front of them, a big giant- twice as big as me! Ha, he was laughing at me - ''Ha ha ha!'' - but l hit him right into his grinning teeth. Smash and bash! And another and another! And another! And... Aah, aah... Suddenly, a pain in my arm, like fire. l saw the river red with blood. And then l don't remember no more. Go on. What remain? l woke up, days later... miles away. A missionary was dressing my arm. Where's the scar, then? Gillie. Soon, in a few years, you'll be grown-up. Beautiful. Someone will love you, want to marry you. And then you have all the power in the world for good or bad. Just with your little finger. A few words, to make happy or unhappy. Well, before you say those few words... think. Be sure what you say is true. Take a long time. Take a long, long time. Now, about the gun. She kept on pestering me about some man she was frightened of and needed protection. You know how women are - they go on and on. Poor kid. She really meant it for once. She was a foreigner, you know. Polish. She was always imagining stupid things. Living in that district, in the end, just for peace, l lent it to her. - Damn silly thing to have done. I realize it now. - Yes, l agree. l regret it terribly, of course. Yes. lt was illegal as well as foolish. However, l appreciate your frankness in telling me about it. Naturally in the circumstances l want to do all l can to help. Thank you. l'm sure you felt very upset when you heard about it. You did say that you hadn't seen Miss Haluba yesterday, didn't you? Yes. That's what l said. lt's all right, isn't it? Then what was your car doing outside her flat lunch time yesterday? - How damn silly! l forgot... - Mr Barclay. You are one understand that you need not say anything unless you wish to do so but that anything you do say will be taken down and may be used in evidence. - Do you mean l'm under arrest? - No. Now you're free to come and go as you please. For the moment. Thank you. But if you have anything else to say, I think l'd get it off my chest now. OK. Look now, this is the sober, solemn truth. l did see Anya yesterday. We were going to have lunch together. When l saw she was dead, l panicked and ran away. l was terribly upset. Yes I know, I know l should have told you but l thought l could get away with it. Had nothing to do with me. People often do that sort of thing. Human weakness, if you like. Anyway, there was nothing l could do to help. Nothing at all. Yes. There's another version to fit those facts, Mr Barclay. That you wanted to break relations with her and she became troublesome. You've admitted a scandal would ruin you. That you took out your own revolver and then shot her with it. But that's not true. l mean, l... lt's completely untrue. Leave go, Bronic! Let me do it by myself. All right, gaucho! Come on, pony! Come on! Don't just stand there. Oh, lazy old thing. Come on! Oh, what's the Polish for pony? Time to go, Bronic? Yes. Afraid so. But l won't be gone long. Just while l pick up our papers. - l'm coming with you. - No. The police would pick you up soon as we get into town. Let's wait till dark, then. Both could go together. - You're scared to be left alone? - l'm not scared. Go on, then, go! l don't want you. Hey. Cheer up, hm? You're not coming back, are you? You're not, are you? No. Sorry, Gillie. Shan't l ever see you again? Maybe. Some day. lt doesn't matter though. Wherever l am, you're still my friend. Look. You stay here until seven o'clock. And l'll be clear by then. OK? - ''Bronislav Kor... chin...'' - Korchinsky. - Korchink-sy - No. Korchinsky. But... How will l know when it's seven o'clock? Come on. You'll know it. What about you? Supposing you can't get on the ship? Don't worry about me. l'll be all right. Once l'm on board and outside the three-mile limit, l'm safe. What's a three-mile limit? You see, when a foreign ship is three miles from the shore, no one can touch you, no matter what you've done. Now, off you go. l'm tired. Go on. Go on. One pair of blue jeans. - No marks? - No. Never met such an anonymous bloke. He may be anonymous but his girlfriend's is in use. Here's my ticket for promotion, Sarge. You ought to be a detective. The bag was found outside Anya Haluba's old address of Latin Squares, sir. All right, Thomas. There may be something in it. l suppose we'd better follow it up. But don't let Mr Barclay off the hook. Did you, you see my bag? Sure. I found the bag. l gave it to the police. Open the door! Hey! ln trouble? Christine? We want to speak to you. This is important, Christine. Have you ever seen that man before? Why, that's the Polish girl. - The girl that was mur... - Yes. But who's the man? That photograph was found in the bag you brought in. Come on, you know who it is, don't you? No. No, l don't know. Now you've not got a very good reputation, Christine. lf l find out that you're lying to me... - I tell you l don't know him. - l think you do. - That bag was left here yesterday... - But l didn't see who left it. Perhaps someone else did. Will you stop bothering me? - Quick. They've gone upstairs. - lt's no good. l'm done for. All my papers were in that bag. No papers, no ship. l'm... I'm really done for if l don't get this ship. Thanks. Keep it. And good luck. This damn thing's a heck of a weight. l've got no feeling left in my fingers. Hello. What's the matter with you? Have you hurt yourself? l wonder who she came with. ls she one of the Thomas kids? - No. She wasn't on the coach. - Probably a local girl. Mind if l borrow your paper, mate? - Hey. Look at that. - Well, what about it? That's her. A kid, a kid we just saw. - No. - I tell you it is. - l tell you it isn't. - Like to bet? - How much? - Ten bob. - Done. - Right. Come on then. There she is! Hey, stop her! Stop that kid! - Got you! - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! What did l tell you? lt is her. - He's right. - Look. No! No! lt's not me. lt's not me! lt's not! lt's not! lt's not! lt's not! Your name is on the list. It makes you very official, but that doesn't guarantee you the job. That's up to the captain. - Have you? - How much? One, two, three, four... five. Thanks. lf l might make a suggestion. Quite off the record, understand? - Compris? - Mm. She's in the Queen Alexandra dock, number five berth. So you deliberately lied to me, then? - Yes. - Why did you lie to me, Gillie? Why? Dunno. l wouldn't have you for a friend, Gillie. l want to be able to trust my friends. l couldn't trust you. l'd never know if you were telling me the truth or not. I wouldn't ever think of Gillie Evans first. l'd say to myself, ''Not worth bothering about.'' Look at me. Look at me! l want the truth now, Gillie. Am l going to get it? And don't say yes, don't say yes unless you mean it. - Yes. - Good! So you saw a man hide the gun on top of the gas meter and then you took it away and hid it yourself, right? Yes. She is telling the truth. l would know when Gillie's lying. Thank you, Mrs Phillips, but please don't interrupt. Now, Gillie, what happened then? Then l took it with me to the church. For safety. l see. But why didn't you come strait home after the service? - A man frightened me. - A man? - What man? - l don't know. - Had you seen him before? - l don't know. You don't know? Had you or hadn't you seen him before? Think, Gillie, think. Well, l think he was the man l told you about on the stairs. - You think and you're not sure? - lt was dark. - How did he frighten you? - He chased me. - What did you do? - l ran away. - Why was he chasing you? - Well, 'cos of the gun, l suppose. l thought if he caught me he might shoot me with it, so l threw it away. - Where? - Over a wall near a pub. Why are you breaking your contract with the British Marine Pool? - Why are you breaking it? - Personal reasons. - Police after you or something? - l hope not. All right. We take you on. Contract for a single passage. - Sign up at Caracas. - Yes, sir. Now remember. We sail on this tide. Now report to the purser. Then l ran and ran. Then l heard that the police wanted me and l was scared to go home in case l got into trouble. Where d'you hear that? Look at me, Gillie, look at me. - On the wireless. - What wireless? The ticket man's. The one by the ferry. What did you do then? l ran away up into the hills. - And stayed there alone all night? - Yes. - Weren't you frightened? - Well... Yes, l was. l know l would have been. l suppose you'd recognise this man if you saw him again, wouldn't you? Suppose l might. Mm. Let's go and see, shall we? - Bridges, we're coming out now. - 'Straight away, sir? ' - Yes. Right away. - 'Right, sir.' Would you mind waiting, Mrs Phillips? Come on, Gillie. - Come on, come on. - Come on, Gillie. Do as you're told. Mr Bridges, this is the young lady who's been so helpful to us. Mr Bridges will explain everything, Gillie. It's quite simple. Take care of her, will you? Come along, Gillie. There's nothing to be afraid of. l want you to take your time of this. Start from this end. This man was living with her. Can you describe him? - lt's a long time ago now. - This the chap? - This seems familiar. - He was here yesterday. - It seems you know more than l do. - What was his name? Ah, there ought to be a medicine for bad memory. There is. Quite a simple one. May l see your records, please? Thanks. Now, Gillie. Where have you seen this man before? Where l live - Clanwis Court. When? - Yes. - 'l've identified the photograph.' - Well? - 'He's a sailor named Bronislav... 'Korchinsky.' - Bronislav Kor... What? - 'Korchinsky.' Korchinsky. Right. l'm busy now. Later. Now, Gillie, about this man. When did you see him? - l saw him yesterday. - Go on. He's the man, the man l saw come out of the flat. Are you positive, Gillie? You're absolutely certain? Yes. He's the man who shot her. l saw him. Now wait a minute. You can't say that. You could have heard the shot but you couldn't have seen it. ls he the man you saw hide the revolver? Yes. But he did shoot her, l know he did. l saw him. - I saw through the letter box. - The letter box? - Gillie, how could you? - l did. l tell you, l did. l'll show you if you don't believe me. Why didn't you tell me this before? l... l was scared. l didn't know you'd caught him. All right, Gillie. You shall show us what you saw through that letter box. And then he took hold of her and shook her and shook her! Then she pulled away and said something that made him more angry. So angry that he pushed that table aside and whammed her! And she fell against the thing and opened the drawer and took out the gun and pointed it at him. And he fought and struggled and fought and got the gun away from her! She started yelling and shouting again and yelling and shouting. - He yelled back... - What were they saying? Dunno. They was talking Polish. Then he shot her. Bang! Bang! Bang! And then she sank. Get up, Gillie. Get up. Then he started coming out of the room, so l ran up the stairs and hid. Scared he'd catch me. That's the truth. Honest. That's the real truth. Yes, Gillie. l believe you. But how did you know it was Polish? Sit down. Look. lt's down here in writing. You said, ''They was talking Polish.'' Well, she was Polish, wasn't she? Everyone in our place knew that. - But how did you know it was Polish? - l just guessed. - She was talking a foreign language. - Alright, the man was talking a foreign language. Do you say ''they''. - l... said she... l didn't hear him. - Gillie! - l did not, did not! - You're lying again, Gillie. You're lying again! - l'm not. l'm not. - Did you hear the man's name? - No. - "Bronislav Korchinsky." -No. Have you ever heard the name Bronislav Korchinsky? - No. Yes. Korchinsky. K-O-R-C-H-l-N-S-K-Y. Presumably I have a list of people employed to the Marine Pool. - Does he have a British passport? - Look it up and see. Korchinsky... Bronislav Korchinsky. AV-first class. Signed off Northern Star yesterday. - Could he have signed off with any other ship? - Not with us. As far as we know he is still in shore. Thanks. Good luck to you. Mr Morgan? - Has the Poloma sailed yet? - Yes. There she is. - Did she take on any crew here? - Yes. There. Korchinsky. - l want to stop that ship. - Stop her? You can't stop her now. She's dropped her pilot. - You might catch her up at Barry if you are quick. - Thanks. She must be about here, Kira Penarth Head. That means she'll be inside the three-mile limit for about half an hour. We can make Barry in ten minutes. Have a pilot boat waiting at Barry. Bring the girl. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Now straight on. Stick to the coast road. That looks like the Poloma. l feel sick. Get on, get on! Get back, man! Get back! Get that crazy thing out of it! Get that thing off the road! Quick! Jesus! - Hurt yourself? - Yes. Yes, l have. - Have bones broken? - Yes. Yes, l think so. My leg. Bad luck. We'll put it in splints on the boat. - The Poloma's alright, but she's not answering. - Can we catch her in this? - Not a hope. - Repeat signaling. - And we must stop her in the limit. - All right, sir. Now you get them? They're answering now, sir. Are we still inside the three-mile limit? Yes. We are. Sorry, Captain, but you've got a man on board l've got to talk to. He's a member of your crew. Korchinsky. Bronislav Korchinsky. Korchinsky? (Speaking Spanish) Korchinsky! The Captain wants to see you. - Cigarillos? - No, thank you, Captain. Adelante! (Come in!) Adelante. Adelante. Well, speak it. - You are Bronislav Korchinsky? - Yes, sergeant. That is my name. Come with me. l suggest that you were the man in Miss Haluba's flat yesterday. That you had a violent quarrel during the course of which she fired a shot. - Then you seized the gun and killed her! - l told you I wasn't there! You still maintain you did not see Miss Haluba yesterday? Yes, l do! Now, Gillie, this is the man you've been telling us about, isn't it? No. Gillie, look at him. Look at him. Look at him carefully now. Now take your time. You, you only got a glimpse of him through the letter box and you told us it was dark on the landing. Now is this anything like the man you saw coming out of the flat? No. l've never seen him before in my life. The captain asks if you're satisfied. No! The captain says he cannot hold back the ship any longer. Each minute costs the company thousands of dollars. - You please tell the Captain... - The captain says he will report the whole incident to the Consul in London. Tell him l want one more minute. And don't be frightened, Gillie. He can't hurt you now. l'm not frightened. l don't know him. l never seen him before. - You must tell the truth, Gillie. - lt is the truth. - Why should l lie about him? - The truth, Gillie, the truth! Gillie. Look at me. Now... ln this world we, we sometimes have to tell little lies, to help other people out, our friends. Now we call this being loyal. And everybody admires and loves somebody who's loyal. But sometimes it's very wrong to tell even little lies if, if by doing so we help somebody bad to go free. That's not being loyal, Gillie, that's being very wicked. Now you be... You don't want to be wicked, do you? Now this is the one moment that you must tell me the truth. The truth, Gillie. This is the man you saw come out of the flat. lsn't it? lsn't it? Look at him, Gillie. Look at him. This is the man you saw come out of the flat. lsn't it, Gillie? lsn't it? lsn't it? No. l've never seen him before in my life. All right. You can go. - Wait a minute. - What is it now? What else do you want? The girl says no. She doesn't know me! Don't you listen?! She said no! lsn't that enough? lsn't that enough?! No. l haven't got the evidence l need yet but l can hold you, and I'm going to. Bronislav Korchinsky, l arrest you for the willful murder of Anya Haluba. - You need not say anything unless you want to do so, anything you do say... - No! No, you can't! - l didn't see him do anything! l didn't see him do anything! ...will be taken down and used in evidence. - l didn't! l never seen him! - Get her out of here. l didn't! l didn't! Please thank the Captain for his courtesy. Tell him l regret the necessity of removing one of his crew. But he will understand that I have no alternative. Thank you, Superintendent. l understand that you have caused me a great deal of trouble. (Ordering navigation report) Come on. Korchinsky! Just a moment, please. You cannot take this man off my ship. He's outside British jurisdiction. I'm afraid I can. We're still within the three-mile limit. Evidently, Superintendent, you do not know about drift and tide and wind. This is my navigator's report. Our exact position is just beyond your three-mile limit, look for yourself. Why should l believe this? Because you have no alternative. Besides, my navigator is not in the habit of giving false information. You are powerless. Your orders mean nothing on this ship. Your warrant is a mere scrap of paper. All right. Supposing this report is correct, you could still let me take him off ship. - l could, but l will not. - Why not? That's my business. Korchinsky, go back to your duties. l'm sorry, Superintendent, but l cannot have any further argument. l must ask you to get off my ship at once. We have already lost too much time. Thank you, Captain. l hope one day we'll be able to repay your cooperation. Goodbye, Superintendent. - You had nothing to hold him on. - Nothing at all except the girl. - Where is she? - Gillie? Gillie? Gillie! Gillie! Get that girl off the ship. l want to get underway. Sorry, sir. This is the way, l'll find her. But don't find her too soon. Right, sir. We've wasted enough time. Where is the girl? We'll find her. Leave this to us. Don't want to frighten her. Get back to the launch. Get me a radio fix. l want to know our exact position. l think the Captain and the navigator are cooking the bloody books. l'm taking Korchinsky off this ship. Right, sir. What are you doing? What are you doing? Go back to them! Please go back to them! Please go back! l'm not going back! l'm not! Hide me! Quick, hide me! Hide me! You, you can't stay here. You can't. Don't see you? You can only help me... Help me, Gillie. By getting off here. By getting off this ship. Every minute... Every second you are here, it's bad for me. Very bad, very bad. You must trust me, Gillie. Trust me. Please. Go. Go now. - But l can come with... - No. No no no! You must get off this boat immediately. Understand? At once. But, but, but we're past the three-mile limit. The Captain said so. We're safe. You could take me with you. But l don't want you. l don't want you. l don't want you! l don't want you! Gillie. l didn't mean it. l didn't mean to say that. I'm afraid the Captain's right. We're outside the three-mile limit. Aah! Aah! Have a nice hot drink, eh? And we'll get you into some dry clothes. Get some brandy! Bronic! Bronic. Well... you've got your man. Yes, l have. A very brave man. [Subtitles reedited by ceque.sub@gmail]
