DVD / DVDRip Duration: 1:29:48 FPS: 25 Israeli Cinema Channel Tommy Lang Productions The technician's on the way. He's coming up the stairs. Can you bend down? I can't hear you. The technician's on his way up. Do you hear me? A little more. - A little more what? -Bend down a little more. You bend down. I'm on tippy toes and I can't hear you. The technician's on his way up. - Good. Okay? -Good. - Really. Where did you put the envelope? I taped it to the Cornflakes box. No way. Are you serious? - That's the only place he'll look. He won't find it otherwise. I can just imagine what you wrote, you hear me? -Yes. What did you write? "Goodbye, I'm leaving." -"Goodbye." On the Cornflakes box, that's surreal. "Goodbye, I'm leaving. I've had it up to here. "Bye. I won't be back. "Have some cereal.“ Awesome. Tami? Tami? Tami?! Thanks, I've got this. Let me help you anyway? It's better than taking off all those backpacks. They look... -Thank you. - Big. Very big. -Not really. They're my friend's. If the two of you want to enter the crevice, you won't get those through. - It's only me. But you said... - My friend is gone. What do you mean 'gone'? I can help you look for her. Do you have a picture of her? Why would I have a picture of her? What are you eating? Super food. - What's super food? Maqui berry, spinach, moringa. You blend them all up and drink it. Do you have a blender with you? I'm the blender. Do you have a digestive condition? Stretch the leg, the back, heads up. Maayan, stretch your arm. Head up, chin. You're out of rhythm, focus. Girls, whose cellphone is on? Oh, it's mine. Excuse me. Hello? What? Ah. Wow. Did you see me? I didn't see and I didn't hear. Maybe a little "psshhh." You're taking that with you? You want me to leave it here? No, but I've never seen women do that. I do. I have a rare collection. I put it next to the... Israel Prize that I haven't yet received. We're not like you men, you stand up, piss and shake. Can I call you Ella? - Everyone does. Where's your friend? - She's dead. Come on, that's no laughing matter. What's your name? Gabi. - Gabi, listen up. My friend Tami is dead. She got stuck in an elevator that plummeted just before we were supposed to go on this trek. Okay? You got it now? I'm... sorry. I really am. - Okay. How about we climb back up? You can organize the backpacks. I'll manage. Thanks anyway. Shit. I thought I turned it off. Sorry. How can you lug that entire motel on your back? It doesn't make sense. - It doesn't have to. It's something you men... Excuse me, I've got this. You can't understand. It's not about making sense. Yes, I heard that you women have exclusivity on emotion. -Okay. Yes. Psycho. Hey, what's up with you? Do you have to do that here? I'm just doing what everyone does. Are you done? - Done and shaken. What? I'm done and I didn't even wet myself. Maybe I did, but it will dry. It's hot out. Listen... this closeness is very weird... We're in a desert the size of... a desert and you insist on walking next to me. I don't get it. This is the path. Where do you want me to walk? And besides, relax, okay? I'm no rapist or killer, it's been proven. For years it's been so peaceful here, until you arrived. You come here every year? - Yes. Why? Because it's where I feel best. Until you arrived with your caravan. Okay, I have to go. Thank you. Really, Ella, what were you thinking? You hate the cold. Yes, but we planned this. Oh, God. Are you impressed? - Very. -Okay. You better be. What's this trapezoid about? It's a triangle. I don't know what to do with it. Can you help me? Wow. -Ta da! - Thanks. You have a tent. -Thank you. - You can fix it up. Thanks a lot. - Sure thing. All that's left is to put your stuff inside. Mom, I'm at Tami's. I mean, ltzik. They want the funeral to be tomorrow afternoon because you have a show at night. Talk to me. Hi, it's Joe. I heard what happened. My condolences. If you want, I'll get the next plane out. Call me. No, actually I have a new phone number. I'll call you. Bye. Mom, what's going on? Why aren't you answering your phone? Call me. Ta da! Shoot, you startled me. What are you, some kid? What's wrong with you? Listen, this is getting out of hand thanks to you. Thanks to me? Out of hand? I know you have to pee. How do you know? I can hear it when you walk. Like waves. Brum, brum, brum. Stop it. This is a tourism site, I can't pee here. - Hold on, did you pay? It's included. Dad. Get up, surprise. I'm back. "Water flows in the Yarkon River, "gushing and gay "splashing and spraying, "pish pish, Yarkon "pish pish, Kishon "pish pish, how the water flows...“ What is this text? You wrote it? A true poet. You see? What a relief. Shall we move on? Yes. -Great. No, leave it, I'll carry it. No, I'm fine. - Don't be so stubborn. Put it down. I'll carry it. Put it down. Hurry up, time is wasting. You know what? It is more comfortable. Of course, now I'm lugging the load. I'd like to know what you didn't put in here. I feel there's... an espresso machine? And a mini fridge? And a grand piano. You forgot the piano. I don't leave home without my piano. He was a famous French director and before the play he said: "Ella, you must change the soutien gorge from pink to black "because you have big tits, you know what I mean?" So I changed my soutien gorge from pink to black because I have big tits. - Did they get smaller? They got much bigger. Tami and I were so looking forward to going on this hike. Alone, just the two of us, no need for anyone else. We planned it around 6 months in advance. And now... I can't believe it. Tetush, call Haifa, ask how many tickets were sold. Okay, Zipi... -Tell them to offer two tickets at a discounted price. Okay. -And tell the bank manager that I'll deposit the checks this afternoon. - There aren't any checks. -Okay. What else? How are you? I'm at the cemetery going round and round, there are signs everywhere, "block, lot.“ I have no idea where I'm going. Do me a favor, call my grocer. Okay. -Tell him to deliver the vegetables I ordered yesterday. - Okay. And also pay the electric bill. - When will you pay me back? Zipi? Zipi? - Okay. They didn't open the theater yet? I can't believe it. Call them now and tell them to open it up. Tell them to open it up right away. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Sshhh, sshhh. You're going to wake the dead with all your sobbing. I'm late, right? Well, she's not going anywhere. - Where is she? In a world that's all good. - Not Tami, Mom. What do you mean, where is she? You mean too tell me that she didn't come to her best friend's funeral? No way. I hope she doesn't bail on me next week, we have tons of work to do. She has performances in Sderot, in Netivot. I just got her a deal with "Appliance Warehouse." It's not your fault, you poor thing. I told everyone she got a sedative injection and had to stay in the hospital. You should have told her that something happened to you. That you were injured in an accident, that you're not a virgin, that you're pregnant. Are you pregnant? Of course not. - If she thought you were pregnant she'd leave in the middle of a show to be with you. Yeah, right. She won't even answer my calls. I don't believe this. Are you insane? What's with you? You know how worried we are? Us and several hundred others? Call me, we have to schedule next week's performances. Call me right away. You think she may have switched agents? Do you have children? I have a daughter, Michal, she's 29. - I have a son, Amirush, he's 33. Widower. Not Amirush, me. I wish I was a widow. Just kidding. I'm divorced. I think. Looking or dried up? Not looking and not dried up. I must have been in a coma when I got married. I can't explain it otherwise. I wanted to be a ballerina. - A ballerina? I'm not that tall, I just look tall. My proportions are off. My legs go on forever. Yes. But I'm very flexible. Look. I discovered that I'm better at acting and singing so I abandoned the notion of becoming a ballerina. But I could have been. I could have easily gone without one potato a day. Easy. So where does your daughter come in? It was an accident. I wanted her. Even with that scumbag. It was hard raising a child with so many plays every night. Didn't the scumbag help out? He's a scumbag, how could he? Tami helped me out a lot. We live in the same building, she's on the 4th floor, I'm on the 7th. And... when I had to perform, which was practically every night, I'd take Michal over to Tami. And if the play was in Tel Aviv I'd take her back to her bed at night. A life of glamor, huh? Yes, very glamorous. Ow. What's wrong? I don't know, I have a spot that's very itchy. Maybe you got stung when you sat down to take a pee. Women don't sit down to take a pee. I squatted. So maybe a scorpion got in there and stung you. -Hey, hold on. I don't know... Let me see. - It's swollen... "Let me see?" Oh come on, what's the big deal? Fine. What does it look like? You want me to take a picture of it? Yeah, and post it on Instagram too... Who cares about your ass on Instagram? - You'd be surprised. There are perverts that get off on it. - Oh, come on. You know you have very smooth skin? Yeah, true Carrara marble. I have tons of cellulite. You don't have cellulite. So you did look. - Big deal. I saw your ass. And... crack. I don't believe it. - What don't you believe? I don't have a crack. Women don't fart and they don't have a crack. You want me to show you my crack so we'll be even? Baboon. I heard that. What are you doing? I'm watering my friend. We've been friends for 30 years. Yes. -30 years. Wow. Yes, I've been coming here for 30 years and watering him. I'm not that young, by the way. A real Catholic, nice. - I guess you could say that. You've been doing this hike for 30 years. Yes, 30 years. - Unbelievable. Hold on. You sure you want to carry that? Yes. -I'm used to it. - No, I'm good. Okay. After me. This way? How will we get in? Truth is... -Should I push you? - I never... I never went through here with 2 backpacks. -Hold on. I don't want you to get stuck like Winnie the Pooh. Hey, we did it! - Bye. I'm leaving you here. - Come on... No, I can't get through. Try. -Wait. Maybe I'll go in ass first. - Put down the backpack. Hold on. Careful. Is there a step? -Yes, one more. - You're crazy, I swear. Okay. Oops!! Wow. I can't see a thing. I can't do this. Do it like you did before. - Don't go. Help me. -I'm right here. How many steps are there? One more. -Okay. - That's it. Another step. - Okay. Another step. - I can turn around now. Okay. -I'm fine. Watch your step. - Wow. What is it? Look at this place. This is where we met. This is where we fell in love. This is where we celebrated our one year anniversary. A blanket... Then we saw this symbol and we decided it would be our insignia. It was raining outside. Do you know what rain in the Negev is? Wow. The whole Negev comes to life. All the animals start running this way and that. Then come the flash floods. The rivers overflow, gushing and surging and... everyone's so excited and... You met right here? - Not right here, but not too far away. I came down one path, she came down another and we met at the junction. Turns out it doesn't take much to fall in love. Can I help? No one can help me now. I want to die. If I could I'd put my head in a freezer. I'm having this insane hot flash. I'm dying here. Okay... Okay. - Shall we go on? Yes. -I'll help you. Don't forget Tami's backpack. - I won't. How could I forget Tami's backpack? Fuck. Shit. Damn... Tami Arbel Did you see that? - No, I didn't. Where did she go? -I... - Do you know her? Who? -Sit down, what are you standing for? I don't know... - Did you see who it was? Who? -The person that parked here. - I just got here. Do you know her? You know her. -I have no idea... - Do you live here? Do you know where she lives? - No. -You're hiding something. I'm not... - You're hiding something. She wasn't there. I'm telling you she wasn't. I don't know. Hold on. Mom. I don't think she's home. Mom? Mom? I work hard, and for what? For people... Sit. I don't get it. - I don't... Look at me, I'm talking to you. Show me some respect. You're freaking me out changing your height all the time. I don't get why you're dismissing me. I don't... -You've been sitting here long enough to know. I just got here. - How couldn't you see? Don't lie to me. Hey, excuse me. -What? - Don't you see me? I do now. - Come here. You don't see me. - I see you. I just wanted to move my car. That's what I want to talk to you about. -What? People running away from me. I'm not running away from you. I just wanted to move the car. Does it matter now? I can give you a ticket, but that's not what bothers me. What saddens me is that you parked here. That you have no respect for this city. I have respect for this city. - You don't care about its laws. And you don't respect yourself... - Listen, I realize there's a problem. - No, you don't. -It's just that... If you realized there's a problem would you have parked in front of a bus stop? - Can I move my car now? No. We're talking. - I have to go. Do you have a pen? -No, I don't. - Look in your bag. I don't have a pen. - Take your time and look. I have to write you up and for what? Listen, I'm in a hurry here. I have to be at a shiva and my mom is missing. Really, I have to go. You know how many times I heard that? "I have a shiva, my dad, "my mom, my aunt..." -I mean it. My mom fell down an elevator shaft. You just said you don't know... No, not that one, my second mom. This is the death notice. - What's this? It was hanging... - Here. You disgust me. People like you disgust me. Where are you going? Am I transparent? Can't you see me? Ma'am, you can't go. - I'm sorry. Do you know who the mayor is? Where do you think you're going? I'll tell the mayor on you! What a shit job. Did you see that? Did you see how she drove off? Can I give you some? Listen, you're so organized. Where is all this from? Got any cream puffs? Cream puffs in the desert? No, but I have chocolate cake. No way! -Way. Listen, I'm dying for something sweet. And I thought I'd lose 5 kilos, I can forget about that. In your dreams. Let me. Great, and I'm the one that's organized. There's a lot of power in that. And there's spinach too. What's that you're eating? - Food. Food. - Food processor. You're the food processor, but what's that you're eating? Food, food... Super food? - Maqui berry. Maqui... what a nice name. Fine, I won't have that. What the hell am I doing? I didn't go to the funeral, I'm not sitting shiva, I can't explain it to myself. I guess I've just lost my mind. This hike was to celebrate Tami's liberation from her husband. I dictated the letter that she left him. Maybe if I hadn't interfered... He was such a shitty husband. A shitty father, a real piece of shit. An evil man. Do you have a tissue? Thank you. Okay, I'm going in. - Okay. I'm going to get ready for bed. You do that. Gabi. -What? Sing me a song. - What? Sing me a song. "A caravan of gypsies passes by "A caravan of gypsies passes by "Rolling and making noise "She pulls my love out of bed "My love, my pride "I wish to kiss your lips "Both day and night..." Nice song, Guricha. I'll try to learn it by morning. - Really? Well, good night, Ella Adler. Thank you. Watch the steps. They're slippery. "Danger slippery surface!" I don't believe this. - What? What? You mean I have to climb all the way to the top? Oh no. No way I'm going all the way up. Okay. Tami never would have done this. She was so scared of heights. You're nuts. So how did we get here? I don't believe it. - What? You brought me here. - Me? Really? No, I don't believe this. And I'm following you... Rather, you're following me. There's nothing to hold on to. So rest a minute. I'll rest in my grave. Actually, this is a great place to rest. Yes, put them down. Amazing. Sometimes you can see mountain goats climbing the wall. It's unbelievable. Now there are only birds. Amazing. It is. Tell me, what are you? You're a security guard, right? -Yes. - You're protecting me. How do you always know what's right? I'm more experienced. And this is what this hike is all about, people helping one another. It's this industry of mutual assistance. So, shall we move on? In just a second. I need to rest a bit more. No problem. What? - What? We're going to climb all the way up there? If you want to. It's insane, huh? Whose idea was it to carry the backpack in front? I only know one woman who does that... Okay, I feel... that I have to rest a bit more. Okay. - Why didn't you start dating again? Who said I didn't? - Oh yeah? Again and again and again. And again? No, the last again was disgusting, I'm repressing that. Why? She was a widow. I'm a widower. I thought the two would go together. Turns out she used to take me to her husband's grave every week. The fourth time I said enough. So she thought maybe she has to reciprocate and suggested she visit Daniella's grave. I said, no, no, no, no, only Amirush and I visit Daniella's grave. Besides, she had this long hair on her chin, it used to flutter in the wind like a flag on Independence Day. Real attractive. Okay. Too much information. Let's go. - Let's. You want that with orange juice? - Yes, thanks. Anything else? - No, thanks. Thank you. Enjoy. Is it you? Are you alright? - Yes. May I sit down? I wish you had said you were coming here, I would have come with. What happened with the cop? She cried, I hugged her. She has a tough job. Screwing people over is tough? It's tough, I don't know. Want a bite? No, thanks. Do you want to go in? Even if you heated this pool to 90 degrees and poured bubble bath in I wouldn't get in. Besides, it's prohibited. And you don't do anything that's prohibited? I'm with you. Would you go in with Amir? - Amir? It must have been tough at first, huh? The toughest thing was picking out a name for him. I was at the hospital and the nurse comes in with this cute baby, she puts him in my arms and says: "He's yours." And I look at this creature and think: "Who is this?" That's when I decided on Amir. - It's a nice name. Yes. It's nice in here, isn't it? Are you planning a trip? - No. Because if you're planning a trip... - I'm not planning a trip. Okay. You sure you don't want a bite? - No, I don't. Do you need help with those papers? It's... my mom's itinerary. Tomorrow she's supposed to be in this moshav. Today she's somewhere around here. So she's doing the trekking path. She should be... That's interesting... My dad is in the exact same area. We hike this together every year. - Why this section of the path? It's where my dad met my mom. It's the exact same section. If you want, I can help you with the maps. And I can come with you if you want. Is it far? Do we have to drive there? It's a short drive but you have to get off the main road anyway. It was good up until now, right? So it shall remain. - I know. A real bumpy road. - Exactly. Natasha. - Gabi. Sweetie! I'm so glad you came. Just a minute. -What? -Is it December already? What can you do? Time flies. It does. Wow. Come over here. This is Ella. Nice to meet you. - Natasha. A trekking angel. -Hello. Soon you'll see what she can do. Oh no. - What's wrong? Oy oy oy oy oy! - What's the matter? A riddle. I told you it's a surprise. Very bad energy. - Really? -Thank you. Right back at you. - That's it, all gone. Now you're all clean. - I'm glad. -Positive energy. Thank you. Now, take off your clothes. Why should I take off my clothes? Take off your clothes. How do you want me to reach your soul? Well? On second thought... -My soul... Okay. - Keep your clothes on. Why? The chrysanthemums have withered. - What does that mean? Best I don't translate. Just lie down. Okay. Get on. Please. -So I shouldn't take off my clothes? No need. No. - Okay. On my back or on my stomach? Actually, it doesn't really matter. Wow, the compliments keep coming. - Either way is good. -Okay. Okay, now I will make you feel nice. Okay. Nice. Nice. - Very nice. "A late train travels along the track "it drops a pea from the last car. "Chickens come to peck..." - Okay, I... I just want to say that... I don't like it hard, okay? - Of course. Just very nice. - Okay. -An elephant came... and stomped. Hey, that hurts! I said not hard. The female elephant didn't come yet. - Okay. The female elephant is here. - What's "slonikha?“ Hey, you're crazy! - Very. -You call this nice? I don't like this. Please get off of me. Get off. Ow, ow. I'm telling you, that woman is insane. She's always so nice. - She killed me. She broke my back. Can you do me a favor? - Sure. No more surprises, okay? - Sure thing. You can talk to me, we can conduct a dialogue, "What do you say? What do you think?“ - No problem. "We're going to do this and that." - Alright. Do me a favor, stay back a few steps. I need some space. Women. Do you want to look in the meantime? I know the area pretty well, but... What is it you found in Romania? Wretchedness for the most part. Tons of poverty, mainly in the villages. But the landscape is amazing, there are forests and mountains and bears and... - Bears? They have bears? -Of course. Huge bears that are insanely dangerous. You don't want to meet a bear in winter... I hear you. But don't worry, they wouldn't eat you. Why not? - They like them fat. Well put. So you came back from Romania just to interrupt your parents on their romantic trip? My dad's trip. It's just my dad. What about your mom? My mom is dead. It's the same with swimming. Right now, before you realize what happened. - Before you get traumatized. -Yes. Where did they say it is? In the shopping center. Here it is. It's so small. Hi. -Hello. - Good morning. How are you? We need two bikes. - Sure thing. Can we leave our backpacks here? Sure, you can leave them here or in the back, as you like. - In the back, so they're not in the way. -Okay. We want to visit Ben Gurion's grave-site. That's easy. - On the bikes, so... No problem. Can you show us... This is the route. Gabi? -I'm coming. You're here. - Yes? There's a level route with beautiful observation points over the valley that ends at the grave-site. Very easy. And we can do the route by bike? - Sure. "The affection of our youth "The love of our espousals - National Park The Gravesite of Paula and David Ben Gurion - "in a land that was not sown "The sun beats down on us "The ground seethes at our feet "And we believe "We will have a perfect world "From here unto eternity..." What he wanted and what he got, huh? Isn't that always the case? Do you think this is what he meant? Would he have liked what he saw? What do you think? Let's go over there. We'll leave the bikes here. "Everything passed "Hardly anything remains "And the broken dream "Is buried in the desert "Everything is buried in the desert" What? Is something stuck in my teeth? What? My makeup is smudged? You didn't eat anything and you're not wearing makeup. -Right. Are you drawing me? You have a strong face. The face of a warrior. But there's a softness too. And forgive me, don't kill me, a little desperation. You saying I'm desperate? Watch it, dude. I can't draw at all. My mom says that when I was little they used to hide the crayons because I would scribble on the walls. So tell me, what does your mom do? She's an actress. - Oh yeah? Anyone I know? Ella Adler. - Ella Adler? Your mom is Ella Adler? That's amazing! What's so amazing about it? What's so amazing? She's Ella fuckin' Adler. Sorry, but I mean... It's amazing! She's an awesome singer, a great actress. Once our class went to this play with a huge telephone. We laughed our heads off, it was amazing. Yes, her show is very funny. Now that you mention it, you look like her. Oh come on. - What? That's bull. -It's not bull. We don't look alike at all. - Her height, her hair. -Gimme a break. - No, the bangs, the bangs. Get off it, I've been hearing that bull for 27 years. Give me a break. It's so obvious, isn't it? - I'm not funny. My job isn't funny. Tami's death isn't funny. "Tami's death?" Who's Tami? My mother. You have another mother? Being with one woman all your life is perfect. A woman who stays young, who doesn't complain, who doesn't ask you to go to Ikea with her, who doesn't ask you to tell her she lost weight. Do you think you and Daniella would still be together if she hadn't...? I think about that a lot. You do realize that I'm not Daniella, right? I'm demanding, I'm a perfectionist, I'm hardly home at night, among all my other good qualities. Yes, but you... you're so... What? One of a kind? What was she like? - Daniella? She was amazing. She wasn't tall. She had light hair, almost blonde, I used to laugh when she was mad, her right eye would twitch as if she was winking, and I envied all the people that she used to "wink" at, but actually she winked at everyone. And she had legs... the legs of a shoe model. And her teeth were so white. They would light up the darkness and the... Here we are. Where to? - Right here. How beautiful. Yes, that electric pole is stunning. You get that she used to call her "my wife?" I used to call her Mom. Unbelievable. You have... you had 2 moms. I didn't even have one. There was this woman who dated my dad. She was amazing. I offered her my entire collection of Pugs, just so she would stay. -Pogs. Pugs. - It's Pogs. We say Pugs. - Fine. No way. Don't tell me it's closed. This is the desert. There's one bike shop. He went to lunch. And we're stuck until he comes back? What should we do with the bikes? Put them in the back. What was that? What? You're acting as if it happened yesterday. And you're acting as if nothing happened to Tami. I hope it won't take me... I hope it won't take me years. It's not contagious. No. Too bad. - What's too bad? I like your hair down. Like this? It's not accurate. Why? Something's missing. What's missing? What do you see? Tits. -This. What's that? I had open heart surgery when I was 16. I'm broken. You're not broken at all. Yes. You know... it's a reminder. A daily reminder of... what you go through, what you went through. And that was the real deal. The worst moment is when you... say goodbye to your family and friends. And you can't be 100% sure that you'll come out of it alive. Wait. Whoa. Wow. Wow. Pee-pee. Me too. It's so cold. I have to go too. Then go over there. I can't pee here. Here? I need something. Bring me a blanket. There's no one around. - Just bring me the blanket. Here. Use this. Hide me. Here. Wait, a car's coming. - Forget that. Lower it. Not too much. - Wait, I have to hold it so it doesn't fly away. - I'll hold it down with rocks. Move it this way. Go already. - Hold on. Hold it like this. - I'm holding it like this. -Don't move. I'm not moving. Hold on. Sing me a song. "There's a river "It is flowing." Idiot. How much longer? - I'm done. Hold on. My arms hurt. Thanks for not peeking. Why would I, you creep. Wow, what a relief. Yeah... You don't have to go? - Of course I do. Don't you think we're overdoing it with the intimacy? Yes, I think... We're overdoing the intimacy? Unbelievable. Oh, that was so good. What's this? Did you write this? You write poems on toilet paper? It's all I had. "Her shadow is a mountain of crevices." - Yes. "Her gait the waltz of camels. "Her black eyes, towers of light for the courageous trekkers." Is this what you think of me? It's literary. I couldn't find a rhyme. - My shadow is a mountain of crevices? My legs are the waltz of camels? Waltz of camels? Have you ever seen camels do the waltz? When I visited the Bedouins. Dancing the waltz? You know... their long legs. Their long legs? I remind you of a camel that dances the waltz? How? Like this? 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2... Yes? - That's funny. -Oh yeah? Then how about we set your poem to music? This dance? Maybe we should give it to someone to cut a CD and... I'll incorporate it in my show. Maybe I'll dance the waltz with camels. You're so annoying. There are no words to describe how annoying you are. I didn't mean to annoy you. You sleep in a tent with me and think you're the man. You're so annoying. Annoy me again. - Come here. It repels hot flashes. What is that, a hump? I swear... You're such a pain in the neck. You're a piece of scum. A Romanian scumbag. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's enough. You really are annoying. I'm cold. No, you don't have a hump. You're such a pain. Camels waltzing? Leave me alone. I want a cappuccino. Go to cappuccino. I bet he knows where we can find cappuccino. Jeep. -Jeep. New. - New. 4 by 4. -4 by 4. I work a lot. I was just asking. Where's your car? I take the bus. You don't have a car? You don't have a car? - Nope. Don't you need one? You said you'd take me, didn't you? Okay. Get in. I'm so hungry. - Then we'll cook. Be honest, you hooked up with me for the food. You hooked up with me... Obviously, you're the most beautiful woman in the Western Negev. Yeah, right, a true princess of the Nile. This is great. And so clean. I want to gobble up this entire desert. Ella Adler. Michali? I'll be right out. Michali. Hi, sweetie. Michali. - Didn't something happen to us? What? A funeral, a shiva? Chocolate rolls, puff pastry. Where are you? It's Tami. Tami, your best friend, Mom. Tami, my mother. I'm your mother, okay? This is how I sit shiva. I'm walking. It's time you got it through your head, I'm your mother. Even if I wasn't home every night... It's not about you working every night. Then what is it? Amirush. How did you find me? What a surprise. I missed you. It's your birthday, let's celebrate. Ella, this is my Amirush. Nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Michal, the star's daughter. We look alike, don't we? - Maybe the color of your eyes. Who's this? This is Gabi. He's hiking here. This is my dad. What a surprise. Not to mention a coincidence. I'm going to make us something to eat. Give me a hand. Michal, let your mom get settled in. Wait, I want to put my shoes on. Something else. A walking shiva, what a startup. You should patent it. I'd love to mourn like this too, hanging out in the desert rather than going to the cemetery, seeing Tami buried in a coffin because her body was dismantled. She was buried in a coffin? - Yes, in a coffin. I'm mourning her too, Mom. I have to lie to everyone when they ask where you are. I say you were admitted into a hospital. And Zipi canceled your shows. Do you remember you have a show at the grocery store in Sderot? How about we all go together? Mom. I need you. I was so alone. I know, sweetheart. - You weren't there. -I know. I didn't know what to do. I cried in front of the mirror. I couldn't stay there. I just couldn't. You must understand me. But why? Why? I needed this time for myself. Do you understand me? Why didn't you tell me you're moving? - You got back early. I couldn't tell you on Skype, that would be stupid. Oh, you thought it would be stupid. So better I get home, don't know where I live, don't know where you are you don't answer your phone. - My lease was up, I wanted something new. I wanted to make a change. Life goes by and I'm stuck on this path. Yes, we're always trying something new. It never works out, or haven't you noticed? -I know, I know. I tried on my own, we tried together. I know. But this time it's different. How? Ella? Yes. She's nice, huh? Yes. She's not like anyone I met up until now. Also Michal. What do we do? What do we do without Tami? Without her awful oatmeal in the morning? Without her super short skirts? - Yes. Without her amazing legs. Without her telling me at least once a day, "When will you rest, when will you rest?“ Now she's resting in her grave. "The picture on the wall "exudes a great light "And I know her, because Ella..." Stop, behave. It's a beautiful song. "Because Ella is smiling..." That's beautiful. What's going on here? - I think we should leave them alone so they can... How was your trip? Not only that... Yes. What... Remember when we met... Stop, it's not funny. Listen, we met this guy and he had this... this... He talked... Who is that woman and what did she do to my mother? But she's sweet and you love her. - Of course. Tell me... That's your dad. -Yes and I haven't seen him like this in a long time. Why don't you have a girlfriend? I did. In 4th grade. Then we moved to this godforsaken place so the girls couldn't come over and I didn't have a car. But your dad had a car. - Yes, but he needed it for work. So what did you do in the evenings? I played music, I painted. We could have switched. Take a mom, give me a dad. Maybe we can now. - No way. She's crazy, but she's so funny. How awesome. - Yeah. Tomorrow we're going for a haircut. Why? Aren't I handsome like this? I don't know, all I see is hair. Fine, but I'm keeping the beard. - No. Long hair then. - No way. It's like your hiding. Yes, I have a secret. - What secret? If I tell you it won't be a secret, are you nuts? You don't have a secret. You wish you had a secret. Okay, go to sleep. Sounds good. Good night, Amirush. Good night, Michalush. Wow, look at that. Why did you only nibble? - Michali? Michali? What are you doing? Getting our stuff together and leaving. Who's going where? - We are? -I'm not leaving. What? -I'm not going back. - But the shiva is almost over. Don't you get what I'm saying? - Mom, stop... -Tami's here with me. This is my way of sitting shiva. Do you hear me? I'm not going back. I can't. Mom, I can't do this alone, I'm sick of explaining you. Making up lies and excuses. You don't have to, it's not your job. It never was your job. But... -I'm not leaving, can't you understand? Mom. -I need time. - Tami is dead. She won't come back. She's dead. You have to say goodbye to her. - Okay. -She's dead. Is this her backpack? - That's her backpack. What are you looking for? What are you doing?! Michali, stop! Those are her personal belongings. There's nothing here, just bras and socks. How will she wear them? Personal belongings... It's nothing. Michali, stop. Michali, come here. Mom. It's horrible, I know. I can't go back. You must understand me. - But I need you. I know, my sweet daughter. Michal. If you want, I'll go with you. I'll go to the cemetery with you, I'll go to the shiva. Wherever you want. If you want me to. Bye. -Bye. -Bye. December. Are you sure it will rain? Translation & subtitles: NG
