Where's my brother? - Sorry? - Listen, nobody's telling me anything. - Sir, you are going to have to wait for Dr. Halsey to arrive. I have no clue- - [Nurse] Dr. Mender to the mental ward please. Dr. Mender. - Just one moment. You must be Andrew Crawford's brother, Kenneth. I'm Dr. Halsey and this is my assistant. - Can somebody please tell me why my brother's in this loony bin? - We prefer the term psychiatric rehabilitation center. - Oh, really? Could somebody please tell me why my brother's in this whatever you call it? - Your brother was found on north beach two weeks ago. When we found him- - Two weeks? And you're just getting around to contacting me now? - Will you please come with us, Mr. Crawford? - [Nurse] Dr. Ross dial 102 please. Dr. Ross please dial 118. - Jesus Christ. - When your brother came to, it was out of control. He kept screaming about monsters trying to kill him. - I believe he actually called them demons. Not monsters, per se. - Indeed, yes. He attacked two nurses while trying to escape the hospital. They'll be fine. But everyone thought it would be in your brother's best interests to get professional attention. - Who is this everyone? Look, I'm not only his brother. I'm his only living relative within 200 miles. Nobody thought to pick up a phone and call me? - (sighs) Let's see here. Kenneth Howard Crawford born September 26, 1976, didn't complete high school, arrested for heroin possession in 2001, spent two years in Walpole State Prison, released after the death of both of his parents in a car crash. In 2003, it seems you spent some time yourself in a loony bin when you tried to kill yourself by jumping off a bridge. Now we all felt it was in your brother's best interest if we handled this matter ourselves. The only reason you were even called is to see if you could answer some questions about your brother's activities before his- - Accident. - Yes. - We can go into my office. It's more comfortable there. - You know, fuck you all. Next time you see me will be with a court order to get my brother out of this nuthouse. (soft somber music) (water lapping) (waves crashing) (water lapping) (soft retro music) - [Cultist] Andrew. Andrew. - [Cultist] Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. - [Cultist] Andrew. - [Cultist] Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. Andrew. (soft retro music) (pencil scribbling) (birds chirping) - Why don't you just talk to her, write her a letter or something? - Who writes letters anymore? - (chuckles) It's been years since I've courted anyone, young man. I think it was somewhere between the Bronze and Iron Age. Yes, great beasts still walked the earth. - You're not that old, Margo. - Old enough, kiddo. Now be a helpful boy and hand me that copy of "The Great Gatsby". - What are we doing with all these books? - Oh, we're packing them up to put them in storage. - Why? - Progress. You see, they're getting rid of all the classics to make room for the CDs, DVDs, MP3s and other bits of Alphabet Soup. But enough ancient history. Back to your girl problems. - I know it sounds lame. I just can't stop thinking about her. I feel like a big asshole. Pardon my French. - (chuckles) Just ask her out on a date. - A date? - Yes, just pick up the phone and call her. - No. No, I'm gonna email her because calling is just personal. - (sighs) Excuse me. I'm going to go find the nearest tar pit. (Andrew sighing) By the way, what is all of this? - All? That's my goatee. - Oh. It reminds me of a New Orleans pimp. (foreboding retro music) (victim shrieking) (knife stabbing) (Philip gasping) (soft rhythmic music) - Goddammit, Philip. We've been waiting for your friends over an hour. I am so not missing this party tonight. Let's go! - Sweet, they'll be here in five minutes. You've been drinking too much. - I know my limit, shit-for-brains! Get in the car. It's over between us. - Yes, munchkin. (soft rhythmic music) (people chattering) - Hey there. I saw you lookin' at me. - Actually just lookin' for a bartender. - (chuckles) Oh? So do you wanna get outta here? This place is kinda depressing. - (chuckles softly) Jesus. My dreams aren't even this easy. What are you, a hooker? - Do I look like a hooker? - Not necessarily. I just figured a non-hooker would be offended by being called a hooker and then I'd realize this was actually happening. I could find an ATM and we could get this party started. - That's quite a plan you got there. Unfortunately, even a hooker would be offended by being called a hooker. - Okay. What do they like to be called then? - I don't know. Monetarily sexual. - Why are you hitting on me? - I think you're cute. - You think I'm cute. I'm a fuckin' wreck. - You're a lot better off than the other guys here. - Okay, well why don't you go elsewhere? - 'Cause I'm ready to go home. (soft rhythmic music) (creatures chittering) - I don't care if you're all backed up right now. I've been waiting for a goddamn tow for over an hour. You know, tonight is my birthday party. No one seems to care or notice, but it's pretty important to me. So why don't you take your hillbilly little ass and get in your hillbilly truck and drive all the way down here and fix this piece of shit if you know what's good for you? - Why don't you just calm down? - Fuck you, Philip. No, not fuck you. Fuck my spineless cum rag of a boyfriend. But you know what? While you're at it, why don't you go fuck yourself too? (huffs) The motherfucker hung up on me! - Can't imagine why. Where are you going? - (grunts) You know, I don't know why everyone's being such a fucktard tonight, but I'm going to my birthday party if it's the last thing I do. - Are you crazy? It's a two-hour walk from here. It's pitch black. (creatures chittering) Let's see if we can get some tunes goin' in here. ♪ A needless horror ♪ ♪ Beyond description ♪ - Oh honey, I got the car started. ♪ It's father pity ♪ - Honey? (crickets chirping) (creatures chittering) (Nikki muttering) (owl hooting) - Hello? Can any of you shitkickers tell me where to find the main road? (flies buzzing) Hello?

Did I wake you? You know, I did most of the work tonight. The least you could do is stay awake. So what brings you to the island? Do you have family around here? - Yeah, kinda. Came out here to see my brother which I shoulda done a long time ago. Now I can't even see him. - Why can't you see him? - I really don't wanna talk about it. - Is he in trouble? - No, I don't think so. For a late-night pickup, you're a little too interested in my personal life. Don't you think? - Oh, I'm not. I mean I'm just. Your brother sounds troubled. Just a feeling. And we've had a string of murders on this island. So I was just thinking maybe he could've heard something or he could have encountered someone, who knows? - Look, I know we're about to fuck. But don't you think it's a little strange to be accusing one's brother of murder? - I wasn't. I mean, I was just. I was just- - You're a fuckin' reporter, aren't you? (soft intriguing music) - No. What? No. What gives you that idea? - So this is your big plan: take me back to your place and exchange information for bodily fluids? That is a shitty plan. - No. (scoffs) Bodily? No, no, no. I'm just (chuckles). No, I like you. I thought you were cute. I'm sorry. I'm new at this, okay? - Just pull over the fuckin' car, okay? - It's important that someone finds out what's happening on this island. All of these murders and everyone's acting like nothing's happening. I need your help. - I can't even help myself. Now pull over the fucking. (Marsha gasping) (tires screeching) (body thudding) (crickets chirping) I am totally screwed. - You're screwed? What about that guy? - No, you don't understand. I'm on probation. If the cops find out about this, they're gonna lock me up and throw away the key. - Pity. With your fingerprints all over the steering wheel like that, it's gonna be a real bitch. - What? You're the one driving. - Who's your witness, this guy? - What, you're gonna blackmail me now? - It's all for a good cause. If you help me get to the bottom of this story, in turn, you're helping your brother. (Kenneth chuckling) - You know? I think I liked it better when you were gonna take me back to your place and have sex with me instead. - Do you know what you're doing? - Well I don't know CPR, but I know what breathing sounds like. - Is he? - I don't think so. - (gasps) God! - We have to get off this island. We have to get off this island. - Listen, we'll take you to a hospital and then you can get off the island and do whatever the hell you wanna do. - Hospital? No. Take me to the ferry. We must get off this island before it's too late. - Okay, we'll take you to the ferry. - Yeah. (winces) - Ferry's on the way to the hospital, right? Well thank god he's drunk. Probably saved his life. - Why do you say that? - Well when you're drunk, your body tends to go soft. That's why drunk drivers walk away from accidents that would kill other people. - You seem to have healthy knowledge of that subject. - Well I'm an occasional alcoholic, I will admit. But I'm a funny drunk. - We must get to Sentinel Hill before the Equinox before it's too late. - He's not a funny drunk. (birds chirping) - Hi. Sorry to bother you. We. We, um. - We're the people that hit the old guy. - Yeah. Anyway, since we sort of put him here, we were wondering if you could give us his name. - His name is Elias Rice. I'll let you know if we find any family in the area to keep him company. - Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. - So what was that old guy talkin' about? What's this Sentinel Hill? - It's on the other end of the island. It is where the original settlers of Dunwich first built the... Well pardon me. You know, I'm trying to give you an important history lesson here. You're not even paying attention. - I know this girl. - She's been missing for weeks. I have a terrible feeling she's gonna turn up like all the others. - How do you know her? - No, my brother sent me an email with her picture in it right before he vanished. I think they just started dating. I can't believe my brother Andrew would- - I don't think so either, but you can bet the officials are gonna try to pin it on him. - Why? - Because the townspeople are out for blood and your brother is the perfect sacrificial lamb. Listen, I need you to help me. I have selfish reasons for doing this, but you need to help your brother and I need a story. Deal? - (chuckles softly) I'm gonna need another drink. - Now Andrew, I want you to count down from 10 to one. - 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (dark retro music) (birds chirping) (bell tolling) - Well she's a snappy tomato. - Hey Evan. That's just something for my life drawing class. - I see her every Friday at the club. Looks-wise, I can totally understand the obsession. - I'm not obsessed. She's just really sketchable. - Sketchable? More like sketchy in general. - What do you mean by that? - Look, just come down to the club this weekend. My band Suicide Pudding's performing and Nikki always goes to our shows. - Do you know if she has a boyfriend, Evan? - No, last I knew she was dating Otto something or other. - Otto Bellenger. - Yeah, that's the one. - His family's one of the richest on the island. - Followed next in line by Nikki's. Nothing attracts money like money, you know? - In other words, she's not gonna give some poor bastard like me the time of day. - Listen, man. I'm gonna give you one piece of advice.

This isn't a fucking hotel. - Hey man. I tell you, this is the good life. Just think about it, bro. Some poor bastard right now is miserable sitting in an office while we get to breathe this fresh air and have the sun beaming on our backs. - Dude, we work in a fuckin' graveyard. We make six bucks an hour and don't get any benefits. How the fuck is that the good life? - Hey, don't knock it. My father used to work here and his father before him. I guess you can say our families always been in graves. - Look, I have to leave early tonight. I've got a date and I don't wanna pick her up smellin' like sweat and death. - Yeah, I got a date with my mother. Yeah, she gonna make Velveeta casserole with hot dogs and we're gonna break open a six pack and watch reruns of "Chico and the Man". Yeah. - Dear God, get me off this fucking island. - But you know, there's somethin' strange about the way my mom makes the Velveeta. It's so good. I'll tell you somethin', it's so good. When she went to the bathroom, I stuck my finger in and I eat it. She saw me eat it. I don't know how she saw me eat it because she slapped me in the back of the head like a ninja. I didn't even see her coming, you know? (soft somber music) (birds chirping) (crow cawing) (singer singing in foreign language) (dad speaking in foreign language) - Oh, don't mind him. He's from France. He just wants to know who you are, sweetie. - Mm-hmm. (seafood sloshing) - Oh, I'm Andrew Crawford. I'm here to pick up Nikki. - Delightful. Care to join us for supper? Mmm. I get such strange cravings when I'm pregnant. (dad speaking in foreign language) (seafood crunching) - Such strange cravings. - Mother, you're not tormenting Andrew now, are you? - No. No, sweet pea. We're just getting to know the boy. Right, baby? (dad groaning) (birds chirping) - I'm sorry. My parents are a little- - Eccentric. - More like fucking insane. - (chuckles) Where to? - I have a little hideaway on the other side of the island. Do you wanna see it? - I'd love to see your hideaway. (dark retro music) (Nikki chuckling softly) - I want you to feel what you're doing to me. Don't be afraid, Andrew. I want you to do it. Just take what you want and make both of us happy. (Nikki moaning pleasurably) - Someone in the club mean when he said that your name wasn't really Nikki? - Why don't you just forget about that, okay? - I'm not gonna forget about it. - (sighs) Yes, my name isn't Nikki. It's Samantha. Just like he said. - So why do you call yourself Nikki then? - Do you wanna know? Do you wanna taste my forbidden fruit? - (chuckles) I wanna know everything about you. - You like? - [Andrew] Why'd you do this yourself? - You know, you act all tough, but you're kinda soft in the middle. No, I like that. I like that you're gentle. Soft but hard in all the right places. - One more stupid question. Why are all of your fishbowls empty? - They're not empty, silly. The fish are invisible. (Andrew and Nikki chuckling) (dark intriguing music) - They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through the seasons. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be not in the spaces we know them but between them. (dark rhythmic music) (dark whispering) They walk serene and primal, undimensioned to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules where they rule once. They shall rule where man is now. After summer is winter and after winter's summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall they reign again. (fire roaring) (Kenneth gasping) (soft foreboding music) (Kenneth breathing heavily) - [Cultist] Andrew. - Andrew. - Andrew. Andrew. Andrew. Andrew. - [Cultist] Andrew, Andrew, Andrew. - Dear god. They'll kill us. They'll kill us all. - It's okay, sir. I'm here to take care of you. It's all going to be okay. - You don't understand. (dark retro music) - This should relax you. You may feel a slight prick. (needle stabbing) (Elias screaming) (blood spurting) - Need any help in here? - He just needed to take his medicine. - Coffee? - You betcha. (blood spurting) (dark foreboding music) - [Dr. Pickman] So now Andrew, tell us what happened in the weeks after meeting Nikki. - Everything was perfect. (thunder rumbling) She made everything perfect. - Beautiful women tend to have that effect, don't they? - Yes. Beautiful. She was beautiful. Everything was perfect until. - Until what, Andrew? What happened? - Otto. Otto happened. (rhythmic blues music) (pool balls clacking) ♪ On the seventh day I was at the bar ♪ - I still can't believe that you dated Otto Bellenger. That guy is such a fuckin' scumbag. - (chuckles) Granted, he didn't treat me as sweetly as you do. But he had some good points about him. - Like what? He's a spoiled trust fund brat. You know, I heard his family made their money helpin' the Nazis out in the war. Prescott Bellenger, he would- - That is just a rumor. - Wow. Rumor or not, that guy makes my skin crawl. He's like some kinda freakish, slimy, weasily man or something. - Freakish, slimy, weasily man. That's a new one on me. - Otto, hey. - You know, I've gotten sleaze, pervert, decadent. My personal favorite: the snobbish debutant. But freakish, slimy, weasily man, that's original. - I mean you are. I'm sorry. - Yeah, you know what? At least I know Nikki's found herself a man that's gonna tell it like it is. - Look, lemme get you a drink to apologize. - Don't think for a moment I'm not takin' you up on that. Can I have another pitcher? Thanks. (rhythmic blues music) ♪ Started out good ♪ - Thanks. (cultist speaking in foreign language) (chuckles) I swear after that, I am never working with her again. - Work with her? I didn't know you worked. - Yeah, when'd you decide to get a job, Otto? - Oh god, not work work. No, I will never hire her as a model again. That girl is on the fast track to Jello land. - So you're an artist, right? - Let's just say I've taken up photography lately. (chuckles) (dark retro music) I like it. It's lurid, yet innocent. It's like Disneyland on crack. Hey Andrew, get that arm out of the way. You're blockin' the light. - Fuck you, Otto. - You can fuck me all you want. Just stop blockin' her light. Hey Nikki baby, why don't you lick your lips for me? Make 'em glisten. Nice. Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. - That's a big lens you got there, Otto. - Yeah. Helps me get right into the action. - Well what're you waiting for? (dark retro music) (Nikki panting pleasurably) - Tryin' to one-up me, Andrew? - (chuckles softly) I don't think I'm ready for that. - Why not? Sure? You can make her really wet if you are. Ain't that right, baby? - Okay. Let's start with Otto on top then maybe we'll switch it out. - Nikki, baby. Turn on the flash. Don't worry, Andrew. It hurts less in the dark. (dark retro music) (flash thumping) He is so fucking boring. How can you stand it? - I like him. He's sweet to me. - Sweet? He's a complete dork. He was fuckin' ghastly in the sack. And if he started cryin' one more time, I'm just gonna punch him in the face and watch him die. - You know, Otto? You could try being sweet. - Yeah, I don't do sweet. - I'll show you how to be sweet. I'll show you on your knees. (dark foreboding music) (water trickling) - [Evan] I told you she was bad news. Why didn't you listen to me, man? - I know. I just can't stop thinking about her. - Thinking about her? Andrew, 20 minutes ago, this girl had you completely fucked up. You don't even realize it. Just forget the name Nikki Hartwell altogether. - Dios mio! You play pelvis pinochle on Nikki Hartwell? Oh man. You bag hotter hos than me, man. - He's so stupid he doesn't even realize he's bein' played for a sucker. Enjoy gettin' fucked in the ass again. (shovel shuffling) - Hey, you got room down there for one more? - Oh sure, man. Just grab a shovel. You know, people are just dyin' to get in here. (chuckles) You get it? Been dyin' to get in here. It's a graveyard. Oh come on, man. You sad I say a joke or somethin', man. Come on, laugh. He-he-he. Laugh, man. It's funny. I thought it was funny, man. You don't like to laugh. Man, you in a bad mood or somethin'. (soft foreboding music) - Hey, what're you doin'? It's beautiful outside, isn't it? Fall in New England? There ain't nothin' like it. I'm Upton. You must be Andrew Crawford. Bet you'd like to go outside, wouldn't you, Andrew? Being cooped up inside of here with all these headshrinkers. That'd drive anybody nuts. Would you like to go for a walk? I could do that for you. You know why? 'Cause I'm your new friend. Your new friend, Upton. Let's go for a walk. - Excuse me. What are you doin' with my patient? What's your name? Where's your ID badge? - Bastards. - I take it that didn't go as smoothly as you hoped for. - It's typical small-town bullshit. Let's go to police records and see if we can find anything there and then let's get a drink. - You're singin' my favorite song. (soft rhythmic music) - [Mac] Line me up another, Sammy. - Sorry, Mac. You've had enough tonight. - Oh, never tell an old seadog when he's had enough. Now gimme another. - That's not gonna happen, my friend. - Wait, wait. Lemme show you somethin'. - What? - Look at it. Beautiful, isn't it? I'll give it to you for another few drinks. - Get out. - What? - I don't know where the hell you found that thing, but somethin' tells me that it's bad luck. - There's no such thing as bad luck. - Happy hour in Dunwich. Nice. - I hate to sound paranoid, but I'm beginning to suspect a coverup. - Okay, Agatha Christie. What do you think's goin' on? - Well typically the newspaper has access to all crime scene photos and documents, unless it's being investigated by the FBI. But for the first time since I've been at the paper, I haven't been able to get dick. - I'm not goin' there. What'd they tell you in the records room? - That the investigation is closed to the uninitiated public. - What the hell's that mean? - Listen, Town Hall closes at five. It gets dark around 9:00 p.m. So if we- - Wait, so if we what? What are you thinking? - That it's a really old building and I didn't see any alarm system. - You're kidding, right? - I need a story and you need to help your brother, remember? - There is no way that I am breaking in to Town Hall so that you can play amateur sleuth. - You have to help me. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do! - No, I don't. - (slaps) Yes, you do! - I can't believe you talked to me into this. - It's a gift I have. - Do you have a plan of action if we get caught? - Actually I do. Mr. Cynical. If we get caught, we just say we're a young horny couple looking for an adventurous sexual trysting place. - Sure you don't write for "Penthouse Forum"? (intriguing retro music) - So tell me about your brother. - You think now's the time for smalltalk? - I'm sorry, I talk when I'm nervous. I can't help it. It's a trait I get from my mother. She did it all the time like in Sicily, you know? And then my dad would look at her just like that. And then he started taking more hours on work. - He's my adopted brother if you must know. - Okay. - His parents left him in front of an orphanage right after he was born. - That's sad. - Not for him. He doesn't know. - Nobody told him? - No, my family thought it was in his best interest. Can we cut the chitchat and get the hell outta here, all right? I've already spent time in jail and I'm in no rush to get back. - Bingo. What the? (intriguing retro music) - Looks like you're not so paranoid after all. - This doesn't make any sense. Why would they want- (loud thudding) - This is our cue to start sucking face. - Oh crap. Let's go. Who would wanna cover this up? I mean it's not like this is political or anything. They're just kids. (tires whirring) (Marsha shrieking) (tires screeching) Did someone just try to kill us? - You know, Marsha? You really possess a keen sense of investigative intuition. - (scoffs) God. (dark retro music) - Don't worry, son. This won't hurt a bit. - Inside every one is an unforgivable secret and we're here to help you find out what it is. - Clear. (electricity zapping) - Feel me, Andrew. I want you to feel me. - No. This isn't right. - Oh, feel deep inside me, Andrew. I'm so warm. I love it when you do that. I love feeling your flesh inside mine. (Andrew coughing) (cellphone ringing) - Hello? - Andrew, it's Nikki. I have to see you. - What's wrong? - I can't talk right now. Meet me at the diner on Pawtucket Avenue in 10 minutes, okay? - Yeah, yeah. All right. But what's goin'? (dark retro music) I can't believe they're gonna kill him. - I told him not to borrow money from those guys, but he wouldn't listen. - How much does he owe? - 10,000. 10,000 by Friday. - So why are you coming to me about this? It's not like I have that kinda money and I'm not really that fond of the guy, especially after what he did to me. - You don't know these people, Andrew. But I do. They're not just gonna kill Otto. They're gonna come after me next. I know they will. I'm your last chance. - All right. You have any idea how I can come up with 10 grand by Friday? - I think so. There's this local legend- - (huffs) Sounds bad. - About a book. It's very rare and very expensive. It's supposedly buried in Smith Grove Cemetery. - That sounds even worse. - It's worth $100,000, Andrew. With that money, you could save my life and we could get off the island and start fresh. - Would you really leave this island with me? - Of course. - All right. I know who to talk to. I'll give you a call by noon on Friday. - I knew you'd help me, Andrew. You have a good heart. - So where's Otto? - Some friends took him in the woods to hide while I could try to find the money. He should safe there for awhile. - Does this book have a name? (soft mysterious music) - There's a copy of my brother's diary in here. I thought only girls kept diaries. - That was awful sexist of you. - Confirmed sexist. Proud of it. There's a lotta mention of this librarian named Margo in here. Do you know Margo? - I hate to admit it, but I haven't been in a library in years. I have a hunch this is gonna work. - Wow. He really was in love with this Nikki girl. I wonder what it was about her. - Word on the island was that she was a slut. - My brother has better taste than that. ♪ Slut ♪ (soft mysterious music) (gasps) Good god. - I bet we find that symbol on every one of the victims. - Why would the police hide this? - I don't know. But there's somethin' strange about it. I feel like I've seen that symbol somewhere before. I just can't place my finger on it. - Well the library opens in five hours. They have to have an occult section. Maybe we can get some answers there. (dark foreboding music) (waves crashing) - [Cultists] Your brother's with us now because you failed. We have him now someplace dark and wet. (Kenneth breathing heavily) - When I was younger, I used to take my brother Andrew out fishing on my dad's boat. One day. One day, I was just teasing him and I pushed him overboard. I knew that he couldn't swim. I just wanted to scare him. The undertow, it just pulled him in. - How could you have known? - I panicked. I mean I could have jumped in and saved him, but I just froze. I mean luckily there was a boat nearby and you know, there were some guys that came by and rescued him. But if it wasn't for them, he would've died. - It wasn't your fault. It was an accident, Kenneth. - No, I failed. I failed at being a good brother at the exact moment that he needed me most, just like I fail at everything in life. - Well now it's your time not to fail. Hey, you're gonna be strong for Andrew. You're not gonna let him down again. (both chattering) Yeah. We'll figure it out. Just hold on a second. Wait. I just wanted to ask you somethin'. I know last night you were havin' like an episode. That was a bad word. You had like a thing last night. But I thought that there was like a, you know? I mean I don't understand 'cause I mean you had an opportunity. - To have sex? - Make love. - Red, you're like my sister. - Good morning. How can I help you? - I was wondering if you had an occult section. - A what? - An occult section. You know, supernatural. - I don't believe we have anything like that here. Good day. - How about something on witches? - No, nothing of the sort. - Satanists? - Well I'll be. - Devil worshipers, blood cults, demonology. Any of this ringing a bell? - Listen, can we talk to Margo? Maybe she can help. - Margo? Did you say Margo? - Yes, I was told she worked here. - Son, are you tryin' to play a sick joke on us? I for one don't find it amusing in the least. - What are you talkin' about? - Margo Warren is- - You'll find Margo on the second floor by the nonfiction section. - Thank you. (dark haunting music) (dark whispering) - You ever get the feeling you're being watched? - Yeah. Let's just find this woman. That's not possible. - You're not that old, Margo. - Old enough, kiddo. - That can't be. Can't be. - She's. She's a- - A ghost? Young lady, there are certain things you wouldn't understand. - Even if you did live a long, full life. (dark haunting music) (door banging) (mob shouting) - Well, well. I guess you've run into the Dunwich welcoming committee. We sure know how to make our tourists feel right at home. Yessiree. - I thought you- - Through Yog-Sothoth, all things are possible. (mob shouting) (gun blasting) - Hurry up! Get into the car! - How do I know I can trust you? - I just shot the bad guy. What more do you want from me? (dark intriguing music) (mob shouting) (hood banging) - Jesus! - We come to bring you peace. (car engine roaring) (tires whirring) - You got the Necronomicon? - The what? - The Necronomicon. You don't have it, do ya? - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - Well looks like we're gonna have to take a little trip to Pop's place. - Pop's? - Over the river and through the woods to grandfather's house we go. - Looks like my day just got a little worse. - Lemme tell ya if the Whateley Clan gets their hands on that book, you're likely to have a lousy fuckin' eternity. - Why is there tinfoil on the windows? - It stops the things from outside from lookin' in. - Silly me. - When did he say he was gonna call? - He said he'd call at noon. Just try to relax. - Relax. I wouldn't trust that kid with unzipping his fly, let alone what we're asking him to pull off. - Otto, honey. Is there anything Ty and I can do for you? - Ty, you got your kit bag with you? - Of course. Lemme show you our daily lunch specials are. May I suggest some tasty Oxies for an appetizer? - Just try not to get too fucked up, will you? - I won't. I promise. - C'mon, Penrod. - Okay. - Fuckin' ball-and-chain bitch. - By the way, name's Upton. Upton Armitage. All right, most important things first. That cult that you had the misfortune of running in to back there at the library? They're all descendants of a family called Whateley. Now the Whateleys have been tryin' to summon a dark god named Yog-Sothoth into this world. Now they got 1/2 copy of the Necronomicon about a century ago and they got the summoning part about half right too. Result? One of them, Lavinia Whateley gives birth to Yog-Sothoth's love child or children. (dark haunting music) - [Cultists] What has been set in motion cannot be stopped and it was written in the stars many eons ago. This has been foretold. - [Upton] The midwife swore that she had never seen a child so large as the one born to Lavinia and they named him Wilber. - [Cultists] Soon mankind will become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild, beyond good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men screaming and killing and reveling in joy. - [Upton] But stranger still, the woman claimed that Lavinia had obviously already given birth to one child by the time she had arrived, one who ripped her up pretty badly in the process. (dark haunting music) (dark whispering) Her father said that the first child had been stillborn but the midwife never saw a body. - [Cultists] From the gulfs of space to the wells of night, ever the praises of Him who is not to be named. Black Goat with a thousand young. - Are you gettin' all this? Good. Anyway, little Wilber grows up with the family harpin' on 'em that he needs to get a full copy of the Necronomicon. - The Necronomicon? Why the sudden interest? - I mean I don't know. Isn't it important? I mean they keep it locked up and on display. - It's a very valuable book, of course. But it's also a very evil book that attracts equally evil people to it. - I don't understand. How can a book be evil? (dark intriguing music) - So no wonder when little Wilber Whateley grows up, he goes to the university library on the island where they got a full copy of the book, right? - This is one of only three known copies in public collections. This is a partial copy and a translation of a translation at that. The university used to own the only copy in the original Arabic. - They used to? - Yes. In 1924, a young man named Wilber Whateley came to the university to study the book. At the time, we had neither the funds nor the opportunity to translate the book. So his offer to do so piqued our interest, even though his academic credentials were sorely lacking that he possessed a partial copy himself promised to aid in the translation effort. So we allowed it under one condition that the book and all of his translation notes remained in the library at all times. 'Course the book's curators were curious and couldn't help but peruse some of the translation before it was entirely finished. (soft mysterious music) The contents of the book were disturbing to say the least. Lengthy descriptions of the botched sacrificial and sexual rituals intended to summon an entity called Yog-Sothoth from a place outside of time and space. (dark retro music) Concerned about the contents of the translations, one of the curators decided to confront Wilber about what exactly he intended to do regarding this manuscript once this translation was finished. Do you hear me? You promised to leave all of your notes here! Mr. Whateley! (Wilber growling) You are a thing from Hell. - There is no Hell. There is no Heaven. There is only Yog-Sothoth. - So when he's found out, Wilber gags the librarian, steals the book and heads home. And here's where the mystery twin comes back into the picture, all right? When the cops show up to arrest him, they find his mangled corpse which looked like had been eaten by 1,000 tiny sharp-tooth animal bites. (slurps) Tasty. Anyway further, the entire wall of the old house had been blown out from the inside and these gigantic unworldly-looking tracks led away from the old house towards Sentinel Hill. I mean we figure that the old twin must've gotten kinda bored and wanted to summon good-old daddy Yog-Sothoth himself. - I thought you said your grandfather had the book. - Thankfully, some of the eggheads over at the university who had been studying the Necronomicon that Whateley left behind, they came in to investigate. And those of you, you guessed it Rice, Morgan and my grandfather Henry Armitage. They put the metaphysical smackdown on whatever it was that was tryin' to enter this world. You know, make the shit outside stay outside. Make what's in here stay in here. - So what happened? - Well you see, they fucked up. - Fucked up like how? - Well they closed the gate all right and chopped Wilber's twin in half. Part in this world and part out there. That didn't kill it. - No shit. - Tonight, the Whateleys are gonna put Humpty Dumpty back together again. - After the smoke cleared, Armitage took possession of the full copy of the Necronomicon. In the years that followed, there were many attempts on his life. That book attracts evil men like a lightning rod. So he thought it best that the book never see the light of day again. - What did he do with it? - Well in his later years, he left instructions for Rice and Morgan that when he died to have the book buried with him in the Dunwich cemetery. - Wasn't he afraid of graverobbers stealing it? - Oh, Armitage learned a few things from the Necronomicon over the years. Among the instructions were that the book should be hidden inside of his body and that certain curses be chanted over the tomb. No, Whateley or anyone in their right mind would ever set foot in that crypt. - Margo, you don't believe in any of this stuff, do you? I mean it seems really farfetched. - I have my reasons to believe. (soft foreboding music) (creatures chittering) - I cannot believe you talked me into this. - Look, you'll get your cut. I promise. - That's not what I'm worried about. - You don't have to worry about any moral issues with me, Andrew. I'm just in it for the money. - Look, when we get there, Batz, you stay with the car. Evan and I will go to the crypt, all right? - Okie dokie, boss. Whatever you want. - This is completely and utterly fucking insane. (soft foreboding music) (creatures chittering) All right, Andrew. Where's the cemetery? - The map says it's like a mile into the woods that way. - Yeah, look. It says sudden death here. - Batz, shut up. - Shh. - No, look. It's even underlined. - Let's go. - At least he left me with the flashlight 'cause there's kinda creatures and stuff probably comin' outta the ground and everything like that. (dark foreboding music) (owl hooting) Dios mio. - Hey Andrew. If I die, please don't bury me here. (leaves shuffling) - This is it. - So remind me why are we here again? Didn't your librarian friend tell you that this place was cursed? - I don't believe in curses or black magic or any of that other bullshit, neither should you. - Yeah, but you know what I do believe in? Not getting arrested. And that's exactly what's gonna happen when the police show up and find us tryin' to break into this dude's tomb. - Give me that. - Not only will I give it to you, I'll tell you where to put it too. - You know, it's not so bad out here. There nothing scary in the woods. (branches snapping) (grave thudding) (Andrew grunting) (dark foreboding music) - Let's do this. (Evan groaning) (both grunting) - Oh shit. It smells like rotting onions and death. - Goddammit. Somebody got here before we did. The book's gone. - So the Whateleys got it. - No, no. It must've been Andrew. I mean he's the only other one that could've. - Hey, what do you mean? How does he fit into all of this? - You know he's adopted, right? - Yeah. He's a Whateley? - A Whateley? Hell no. Don't you get it? He's my baby brother. (soft foreboding music) (creatures chittering) - [Evan] Jesus. - [Cultist] The soul that pines for eternity shall outspan death. You dweller of the Twilight Void come. - So now what? - We get the book. - See, I knew you were gonna say that. But I guess part of me was still hoping you'd say, "Hey, let's grab a cheeseburger and call it a night." I guess hope springs eternal, huh? - Yeah. Just move the arms. - Sorry, man. You owe much more than 10%, my friend. Much more. (soft foreboding music) (vehicle engine roaring) - All right, first course of business. We go in there and we get our brother outta the asylum. 'Cause they already tried to kill him once and no doubt they're gonna try to kill him again. - Hello Andrew? What's going on? That's fantastic. I knew you'd do it. When will you be here? Great. We'll be waiting for you. I love you, Andrew. (soft foreboding music) (creatures chittering) - C'mon, let's go. - Andrew, we can't just leave him like this. We robbed this guy's grave. We at least have to put it back. - Who fuckin' cares? - Fine, I'll do it myself. At least I have a conscience. All this for a book that's not even worth a dime. (Evan wincing) - You all right? - Yeah, it's just a nick. - Come on, boys. I got a bottle of Uncle Bunky's ripper on ice. (dark mysterious music) (Batz grunting) (Batz shouting) (Batz shrieking) - Come on, let's go. We'll get you somethin' for that hand after we bring this to Nikki, all right? - I just wanna get the hell outta here. I'm startin' to feel sick to my stomach, man. (creatures chittering) (dark foreboding music) (eerie whispering) (dark snarling) Batz. Where the hell are you? Batz! - Dude, shut up. You're gonna get the attention of every cop on the island. He probably walked home. He lives like 20 minutes from here. (creatures chittering) (dark haunting music) (clock ticking) - I shouldn't have told him. - [Monster] Andrew. (blood spurting) (waves crashing) (dark retro music) - Are you sure about this? What if Otto finds out? - If Otto finds us, I'll just ask him to join in. I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you? - Yeah. Yeah, I would. - You're a filthy pervert. Aren't you, Penrod? A filthy, slimy pervert. - I am. And with all that money we're gettin' from that book, I think I'll be able to better afford my vices. - What is your best choice? - I don't know, fucking? What's yours? - Eyes. I'm a sucker for a nice pair of eyes. (dark retro music) - I never had anyone do that to me before. That's pretty hot. - Trust me. It gets better. (blood spurting) (Penrod screaming) (dark foreboding music) The windows to the soul. (soft foreboding music) - [Margo] It's also a very evil book that attracts equally-evil people to it. - We're wasting our time. They're not gonna let him out. - Didn't your mother ever teach you anything? It's not what you're askin' for. It's how you ask. - (groans) You gotta pull over, man. I think I'm gonna be sick. - Evan. I can't pull over right now. We're gonna be there in five minutes. Just hold on. - (groans) I don't know what happened. My head is just so dizzy. It feels like it's gonna explode. (groans) Please, man. - Come on. All right, we're gonna be there soon, okay? Just hold on. - Penrod, where the fuck are you? Where the hell are you, Penrod? (dark foreboding music) Penrod? (drill whirring) Fuck! Oh, fuck! (screams) (drill whirring) (blood spurting) (creatures chittering) - All right, I gotta get this book and bring it to Nikki, okay? I'll be right back. - Andrew, please. You need to get me to a hospital, man. - What the fuck? (Nikki shrieking) Nikki? I'll be right back. I'll be right back, okay? (dark foreboding music) - I want my brother outta this nuthouse, pronto. - Sir, to allow your brother to be released, you'll have to fill out Form 223-A, have it signed and stamped by a notary public, fax or mail that document. (gun cocking) Oh, I see you have the easy form. - See? I told you. It's all about the presentation. - All right, can you go find my brother? I wanna make sure she doesn't go wandering off. - I'll be right back. - Don't go anywhere. (dark foreboding music) (Andrew gasping) ♪ Ring around the rosy ♪ ♪ Pocket full of posy ♪ ♪ Ashes, ashes ♪ ♪ We all fall down ♪ - Andrew? It's time to go now. - Andrew's not here right now. But if you'd like to leave a message, (Marsha gasping) wait for the scream. (knife stabbing) (Marsha shrieking) - Stay here. (dark intriguing music) (Evan laughing) - Nikki. Nikki, where are you? - Right here, lover. - Nikki. What's going on? Are you all right? - (chuckles) Hey stud. Not only does he suck in bed, he's not too bright, is he? - What? - Give us the book, Andrew. Give us the book and everything will be fine. - Listen, the only thing I'm concerned about is Evan. I need to get him to a hospital. He's got a really bad infection. - Soon all of that will be irrelevant. Once Yog-Sothoth is reborn into the flesh, the gate between life and death will be at His command. - Andrew. I think I'm really sick, Andrew. (dark retro music) (flesh spurting) - Nikki. - My name isn't Nikki, Andrew. Nor is it Samantha. It's Lavinia. Lavinia Whateley, named for my great grandmother. (dark foreboding music) - [Otto] Uh-uh. (fist bashing) (lights zapping) - Before those pretty eyes fill up with your own blood, I want you to look at me. (slaps) Look at me! In about one hour, this world is gonna change. We're about to shake things up here on Planet Earth. But before you sink into a deep, black nothing, I want you to remember one thing: you could have prevented this, but you failed. You fucking failed! Armageddon isn't like horseshoes, sport. There is no close. (dark foreboding music) (fist bashing) - Hey you big bully, why don't you pick on somebody your own size or species? (Wilber laughing) (lights zapping) - Oh, look who it is, good-old Upton Armitage. Now that's gonna get me some serious brownie points with the Outer Ones. (lights zapping) What you got there, some mystical little doodads comin' to put the whammy on me? - If you just hold on one second, I got somethin' for ya. (lights zapping) - You know, that hocus pocus juju shit can't stop me. It didn't work 100 years ago. It ain't gonna work today. - Just hold on a second. Drat. Why did I leave 'em back at the house? - Aww. Looks like you're shit outta luck there, sport. - I think you're shit outta luck, sport. (gun blasting) (Wilber coughing) (dark foreboding music) (lights zapping) - (chuckles) You dickhead. (lights buzzing) - Can you get up? (breathes heavily) That's a good look for you, kinda hamburger chic. (soft somber music) They must've already gotten Andrew. We gotta get to Sentinel Hill. We gotta get to Sentinel Hill right now. - This is all my fault. I should've come in and got him myself. - Kenny, come on! We gotta go now. (Kenneth weeping) Look, you got a choice. We can either let them kill our brother and you can let her death be for nothing or you can help me rescue our brother. It's your choice. (soft somber music) - When we get to Sentinel Hill, you're gonna have a choice to make, Andrew. - A choice? - Yes. A long time ago, one of your ancestors did something to one of mine. - Wilber Whateley. - No, it was his twin brother, my late great, great uncle. - So what's this choice? - You're gonna help us lift the curse that your grandfather laid by spilling your seed on the ground where it happened or your blood. Either way, those of us who have inherited the blood of Yog-Sothoth will herald His son's return into this world tonight and he will lead us in the final Rite to open the gate. - So what's it gonna be, Andrew? Fuck her again or get fucked? (laughs) (soft foreboding music) - What are you doing? - How about fuck you both? (Nikki gasping) (water splashing) (waves crashing) - Could somebody please tell me why my brother's in this loony bin? (waves crashing) - [Cultists] What has been set in motion cannot be stopped. It was written in the stars many eons ago. This has been foretold. Soon mankind will become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild, beyond good and evil with laws and morals thrown aside and all men screaming and killing and reveling in joy. (dark foreboding music) Come now. Come before your twilight void. (soft foreboding music) (thunder crackling) - I have returned and I bring the Words of the gods. They are pleased, but they require one more sacrifice to satisfy their time is ending. - [Cultists] Come forth, Great One, and complete the cycle. Your time to rule the world has come again, as it was before and as it shall always be until the last breath of time. (dark foreboding music) - The Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be. - [Cultists] As they have always been. - [Nikki] Not in the spaces we know but between them. - [Cultists] Beyond space and time, they wait. (dark foreboding music) (waves crashing) - Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. - [Cultists] Yog-Sothoth is the gate. (eerie whispering) (waves crashing) - Yog-Sothoth is the key and the guardian of the gate. - [Cultists] Tonight we open the gate. (waves crashing) - Past, present and future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. - [Cultists] Yog-Sothoth is beyond all time. (waves crashing) - He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old and where they will break through again. (eerie whispering) (waves crashing) - [Cultists] Tonight, the gate shall be opened. (waves crashing) - So what's the plan? - Well my first instinct would be is go in there, start killin' people, steal the book. That should fuck up their little tea party. - Yeah, I can get behind that. 'Kay, ready? (dark foreboding music) (knife stabbing) (Kenneth growling) (gun blasting) (Nikki snarling) All right, you go get Andrew. I'll take care of Nikki. (gun blasting) - Brother. - Andrew? (knife stabbing) (Upton grunting) Kenny. Get the book. Get the book! (dark foreboding music) - You let me die, Kenneth. Now I live for Yog-Sothoth. Well now it's your time not to fail. You're gonna be strong for Andrew. You're not gonna let him die again. - (sighs) Why? Why? - The death song of every martyr through history. (soft foreboding music) (dark reverent music) (Kenneth shouting) - No! No! No! (weeps) - In the end, all things return to the sea.
