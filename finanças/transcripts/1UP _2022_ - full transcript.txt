The history of video games stretches far back to the early 1950's. Novelty simulations by adventurous students inadvertently formed the foundation of what is now a several-hundred-billion-dollar industry. Before characters like Donkey Kong, Sonic, and Tomb Raider graced our screens. Lara Croft is smoking. Tits. -What's your name? -Todd. Todd. You're talking about her animated endowments? I guess so. Well, that is actually the point of her design. It wasn't long ago that games were marketed entirely to a generation of guys. How many of you have played Assassin's Creed? The publishers decided that playing as a female character made the game un-relatable. So gamers could not relate to this, but they could relate to this? But here's the thing, as the gaming industry exploded in sales, the profile of a traditional gamer has dramatically changed. And now, gamers are everyone. -Even Todd. So when some of you decide to make games of your own, for the love of God, please consider giving your female characters a pair of pants. Or regular-sized tits! Bingo! I'm Parker Nesby and this is the history of video games. Parker Nesby, I know that name. All right, all right, and now with just the starters. Yo, out support! Out of here. Okay, yo. All right, I'm gonna stand like-- All right, you guys, right here, right here, okay? Smile, raise your eyebrows, stop smiling. -That's your model face. -Who opened the toolbox? All right, cool, just like some singles now. Like of me. -Solo, that's a single. -Oh. -Single, me. -Okay. Like, you know. Just like a little bit quicker. Dabbing is not a thing anymore. Okay, dabbing is still a thing, and literally everyone can hear you. Oh, Ricardo, why aren't you in the photo? Like, if you catch the muscle on accident. Oh, who's this? Oh. Who's that? Miami's on line. Two minutes to game time. -No mercy, boys. -Whoo. I might have to sit this one out, Captain. I think I flexed my thumb too hard in the warm-up. Let me take a look. Oh, oh. How's that feel? Has he ever touched you like that? -One to ten. -Oh. Ugh, he will never touch me like that. Eleven. -V! -Yeah? You're in! -Oh, my God! Okay, change of personnel, but we stick to the plan. Points are great, but they only matter in tournament seeding. Destroy the orb, get the win. V, you run support. Don't screw it up. Betas on three! One, two, three! -Betas! -Betas! An allied tower is under attack. Dustin! They're flanking us. I know what I'm doing, support! Then stop face-checking and let our casters blast at range. V, I need a heal over here. Okay, I'll be there in a second. Yup, my girl. Yeah. No, no, no, ugh! Dustin, pay attention. I need to heal the others too. Quit squawking over the comms and let me run this. V, seriously, chill. She's literally keeping your boy in the game, Ricardo! Whoo! I am crushing last hits. -I'm wasted. They got behind me. Everyone, listen up, they're outflanking us. Charge straight up the middle. Just said that. I need a heal. Running support means more than just healing you, Dustin. Everyone else is dead. The enemy has been slayed. The power is mine. Oh, victory! That's what I'm talking about. Yeah! And that's how it's done. -Suck it, Miami! -But we almost lost. You're not always gonna be so lucky. V, I know you think you know what you're doing, but you have a lot to learn, okay. And you will, from the bench. Seriously? I'm a nationally ranked player! With far more skill than most of you. That's not remotely true. It's kinda true. Look, Dustin, I need to have a role on this team. You are support. If you earn a better position, I'll give you one, but considering we're the reigning collegiate champs, I'd say we're good as is. Everyone let's just be cool. We're all on the same team. -I don't know. Are we? -Whoa, easy, V. Don't get all emotional, 'cause I'm not giving you special treatment. Special treatment? I earned my gaming scholarship, because I'm a good gamer. Oh, hate to break it to you, V, but the only reason you have a spot on this team is because you guys have... -You know, vaginas. -What? I actually uh-- I think it's vulvas, Dustin. Yeah, come again. Yup, vagina is just the birth canal and the vulva is the all-encompassing-- Owen, please. Vaginas. I'm done. -V, come on. -No, I'm done! Oh, you quit? -Oh. -I quit! Do not touch that, Owen! You all have some serious issues. I'm out, too. Wow! I've never witnessed live-action PMS. Clean up all that crap, Owen. -V, wait. -Not now, Sloane. I'm done. Come on, Barrett. Let me hear you! You're freaking me out! Please stop yelling. You've been sitting here comatose for like an hour and I'm really worried about your aura. It's usually like a bright purple, -but right now it's like... -My aura's fine. Come dance with me. Let's go. Wasn't getting me out of the dorm victory enough for you? Yes, but now you need to move your body. Feel the energy of this magical place. This is the cafeteria. Suit yourself. -Boo! -Oh, Owen. Hi. V, it's good to see you. Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry about earlier today. Sometimes Dustin can be-- A real dick-bag. Yeah, and it's all the time. Like 24/7. So, where are the rest of your Betas? Shocking, but I don't actually hang with them much. I'm just, you know, riding it out for the scholarship. Oh. Oh yeah! Whoo! Ooh! That's my roommate. Oh, um, I'm gonna grab a juice. Can I-- Can I get you one? You know what? I'm-- I'm just gonna go. It's just been a long week and I'm exhausted. Okay. Cool. Yeah, well-- well, I shall see you later, V. Yeah. -Bye. -Bye. Thank you for shopping at Game Home. Figured I'd you find you working the hole. You know me, I'm always working the hole. -Life goals, baby. You know I would like to confirm that your manager makes me thirst. Lewis? Gets Cheetos stuck in his beard all the time and says things like "ill". He let me cut the line for PS5 though. I think I really messed up. Me quitting the team has made my whole life go poof. I hear you, girl. I'm in the same boat. Those assholes ruined gaming for me too. -Yo! Hey, you kids wanna see something ill? -No, we do not. -Maybe. Guess who's an influencer now? This guy. Do you enjoy my balls? Subscribe. Shall you take my elder orbs into your mouth hole. Come on, it's brilliant. Lewis, can you give us a second? -Girl talk. -Have you been eating butt cheese again? Yo, dickwhistle, wanna see something ill? Sloane, if I'm not on the team, I lose my eSports scholarship. That's the only reason I can afford to go to Barrett. You know when life doesn't go my way, I usually get really high and watch Captain Marvel. -Why? -Because Brie Larson is super-freaking hot. And it's a tremendous setup to Endgame. Wait. What does Captain Marvel do? In the bad-ass montage? Oh, she gets back up. Mm-hmm. -Yes, yes. We get back up. -Okay. We are gonna start our own team and take down the Betas. -I don't think it's that easy. -Why not? What do we need? Some matching outfits and a name? And a team, V. We need players. Sloane, we're gonna start an all-girls team. And kick the living crap out of those Beta assholes. Oh. Oh! -Yes, yes, yes, yeah! -Yes, yes, yes. -Huh, what? Oh... Come on in. Hey, you guys. Welcome. Oh, it's so nice-- No, no, no, no, no. Don't close the door. We don't close doors here at Barrett. Okay. Oof, all right. Oh, my gosh, what a great surprise. -Hey, have a drink. Yeah. -Ooh, what's this? -Kombucha. -Oh. And whale sperm. Supposed to be good for the skin, yeah. So, I'm, uh, Dean Davis, preferred pronouns, he and him. Oh, um, um, her/she. She, Sloane. Fantastic. -Come on in, we'll chat. Have a seat, we'll talk a little bit. I just got these fancy things-- Oh, hang on, Look out, oh, no, no. Stay where you are. Don't get up. It's cool. I just got these, you know. They're a little tough to get used to, but I had one in college. I don't know how to use them anymore. Okay, I think I should start off by saying this is a safe space and anyone in the safe space will be treated equally. Uh, we're also being recorded for liability protection, mostly mine. Uh, oh, uh, do I have your verbal consent on that? -Yeah. -Sure. Great. So, uh... yeah, what brings you to my office? -I said it was a safe space, right? -Yeah. -Yes. -Okay, good. Um, so we wanted to propose the formation of an all-women's eSports varsity team. Really? Oh, that's fun. Oh, that's great, yeah. I hear you, I see you. I'm processing your feelings. It's okay. No, no, no. No, no, no. All right. I don't know what's up. I am losing it. What's an eSports team? It's um, like, vid-- Competitive video gaming. Competitive video gaming, like Nintendo and crap like that. -Yeah. -That's a sport? Yeah, we have scholarships. Oh, I'm telling you. I don't know what's what anymore. I had a kid come in here just earlier, telling me he was pre-triggered. I don't even know what "triggered" means. -Triggered is like a trauma response-- -I don't care. I got one year left here. And my only goal is to not rock any boats. And to do that, I gotta have no change whatsoever. We just want a game. I suppose if I say no, you're gonna cancel me, right? I tell you what, why don't we work together? We can do that. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you your special little team. -You will? -I will, on one condition. I don't wanna hear you or see you ever again. Do we got a deal? -Yes. -Yes. Do you like gaming? Overwatch? Animal Crossing! -Valorant! -Fortnite! Last Of Us! Minecraft! Come to the audition and join us. -We are gamer girls. -We are gamer girls. Oh! Gamer girls wanted. Come to tryouts. -Join our team. -Join us. Hey, girl! Tell your girlfriends. So, do you game? I dig confrontation. In video games, right? Fact, you're living in a giant snow globe. -Well, actually-- -Fact! Sir Isaac Newton was a certified idiot. Lot-mal mayal Diane. I think I heard a "Diane" in there. Was that Elvish? One of the many proud languages of the Elven people. The Earth is flat! Show me the curve. Okay, out! Okay, Diane, do you game? 100%. I mean, LARPing, cosplay, role-play. But do you play Elder Orb? Do unicorns poop rainbows? I main as tank support. I love smashing skulls. Now we're talking!

These aren't even good dick drawings. What kind of psycho puts hair on the shaft? Oh, Dustin. Cock, cock, goose. -Whoo. -Sweet wheels. Sorry, I just got axed by the world's biggest douche! Well, we know that douche and we know the best way to get back at him. So there's another team? Mm-hmm, about to be. So you game? Whatever keeps my fans happy. Are you like an influencer or something? Do you know any other crippled sex kittens -that crush at Elder Orb? -Ever play on a team? You're looking at the captain of my state champion high school squad, sweetie. Welcome to the 8-Bits. Follow us. Who are you guys? We are the 8-Bits. Um, is Parker Nesby here? Mom, there's some weirdos at the door for you. Ace, what'd I say about opening up the door to-- Oh, uh, what's all this about? I'm in your History of Video Games class. Regular-sized tits. Ah, yes, I do remember you. Could we come in? Uh, I guess. Hey, hey. ...for the old comfort. Juice it loose time. Uh, well, you're an eclectic bunch, aren't you? -Shouldn't you all be in school? -It's Saturday, Mom. Oh, that's why I keep you around. So, is this about the term paper or-- We are starting an all-girls eSports team at Barrett. And we need your help. Cute. But that's gonna be a hard no. Um, I thought you said she was already on board, V? Yeah, what's the deal? I said I think she might be in. Can we talk? In private? Mm-hmm, sure. Can I get a bowl of those? Coach you? Wow, no way in hell. I know who you are. -I googled you. -Creepy. You designed Age of Neutronium. That's literally the game that got me into gaming. That is literally the game that got me doxxed out of gaming. I don't need my son opening up hate mail on the porch anymore. Listen, I am sorry that the system sucks for you and it does, -but what you want me to do about it? -Coach us. -Why are you so scared to? -I fear nothing. -Then we're the same. -Wonderful. Then you're gonna be great. Now grab your oddball friends and let's end this home invasion, shall we? Okay, wait, you said it yourself, things are never going to change unless we make them. I said that? It's quite profound. Look, bottom line is one gamer girl to another, I'm on a scholarship and if I don't have a team, then I'm a ghost at Barrett. Come on, Mom. They need you. I mean, they're totally pathetic. Hey. Dude. Look, we're not gonna let you down. Shit. All right. Oh, boy. Are you committed? Are you sure you have what it takes? -Yes! -Yes! -You fools ready to go to war? -Yes! -Ma'am, yes, ma'am. -All right. So you're really gonna help us? -Yes. But only out of pity. Now get out of my house. Come on. Wow, the Dean hooked us up. Okay. All right. Okay. This um-- It's not that bad. It's actually better-- better than I thought it would be. Smells like somebody died in here. And their ghost took a shit. -I think somebody did die in here. We can make this feel like home in no time. By participating in this venerated ceremony, you'll be linked for eternity to the many great Betas who came before you, dating all the way back to 2015. Present the recruits. -Kneel. -Yeah, kneel. Do you, Geoff and Jeff-- Wait, they have the same name? -Geoff. -Jeff. Okay, cool. With this sword, you will be knighted Betas. No, no, no, no, it's okay. It's a ceremony. Jeff and Geoff, you are now inducted into our sacred gaming brotherhood. Behold! The newly knighted Betas! Oh, God. -Oh, if it isn't the 8-Bits. -More like the eight bitches. Easy with that, 'Cardo. Female traitors, yes. Oh, sorry, I thought the insult convention was down the street. Oh, then take those size 13's and walk there yourself. Seriously, you left the Betas for this? You couldn't just get in line like everyone else? This eSports team isn't your birthright. Oh, meet your replacements. The newly knighted Betas. How's that make you feel? If I had a penis, flaccid. Oh, you wish you had a penis. -Oh, a strap-on like yours, babe? -Oh, I will strap-on right now! -You can't say that, Ricky. -It is Ricardo. -Whatever! -Thou wanteth a strap? 'Cause I haveth one. Bringeth! With extra girtheth! -Oh, I'm lubing up right now. -Jump in, baby. Water's warm and I'm already wearing a T-shirt. Let's spread those cheeks and see where I fit. Oh, I'm spread, I'm spread, I'm like peanut butter and jelly. -What is happening? -This is what's happening. -Oh, oh! Oh, my God. What did you eat? -What are you, a camel? -Yeah, that's what I call a pearl necklace. It's gonna burn right through your clothes. -Ew. -Hey! Dick or no dick, tonight we celebrate not being dicks. Celebrate all you want. 'Cause after Monday's match, the only partying you're gonna be doing is pity partying. What are you talking about? You haven't seen the schedule? Your first match is against us. -Ba-ba-ba-bah! -Yeah, ba-ba-bah! All right, everyone, let's break it up. Yeah, let's break it up. Back to the house, boys. All of you are going down. Looks like she jizzed on you. Jeff, Geoff. Diane, I'm seriously gonna have nightmares about that. All right, 8-Bits. It's game day. Here we are, all together. All of us. Anyway, what uh-- What game do you guys play? Knights of the Elder Orb, duh. Knights of the Elder Orb, duh. Cool, I'm really not familiar with that game. But I will be. So, what's up, Galadriel? And, uh, the-- The-- The voice? -Comes with the costume. -Okay, cool. Moving on, uh, I have no idea what any of your strengths are, but play to them. Play to your strengths. Great. Great session, guys. All right. I feel uninspired. Chin up, we're gonna do great. Oh, hey, watch out for that turret, it shoots... -Goddamn it! -...lasers. Betas, don't let them take a single tower. -Jenna, what are you doing? -I'm helping you. -Get back in the jungle. -I'm quickly popping back to base. -Someone cover mid. -Okey dokey. -Lilly, look out! -Oh! -I'm gonna rip your throat out next time. Come on, look alive out there! -Kinda impossible. All right, team, my ult is ready. Let's pick one off. Did you guys see that? Jenna, pay attention! Betas, time to blitz! -I'm with you. -Got you! On it, Captain! No, no, no, no. Back to base. Defend our Axis. -On it. -How about some defense? -Yo, I got that orb. -Where is everyone? Defend, defend, defend, all you want, baby. Going in. Bam! -You guys got ganked! -G-G-G-Ganked. -"Nationally ranked." -More like nationally ganked! -Oh, looks like we're too spicy for you. They are horrible. Wasn't someone on the team supposed to be guarding the orb? Go back to playing Fruity Frog, nerds. -I hate them. -I hate them too. The whiskers aren't just on my face, ladies. Subscribe! Oh-ho, look at that! I'm a "putty tat"! V! -Hey. -Hey. I didn't know you worked here. Oh, welcome to my second home. So, you get free stuff or what? Oh, just nominal discounts for selling my soul. Seems to be the new norm these days. Did you bring Band-Aids for my wounds? Go easy on yourself. That was your first match. There's bound to be some kinks. Is that what you're calling total annihilation? My whole collegiate future is in tatters. Yeah, but you started your own team. You're doing the right thing. It's pretty awesome. So did you come here to buy something or... No, uh, actually, I was gonna ask if maybe you wanted to hang out this weekend? Oh, um, I-- I don't-- -I don't really have time. -Oh, okay. We could just game, online. Friday night? You gotta practice, right? -Nice counter. -Thank you. -I'll see you Friday. -Okay, cool. -I'm "0win", by the way. -Yeah, I-- I know your name. Oh, no. No, I mean my-- my handle. -It's "0win." -Oh. But the E is an I, because "win" -and the O is a zero, because the-- -Mm-hmm. Okay, well, I'm gonna go, so... -I'll-- I'll find you on Friday. -Okay. -Bye. -Bye. Hey Owen, the exit's that way. -Bye. -Bye. Hmm. Diane, get off my ass! I'm not on your ass, I'm under your ass. -I'm gonna freaking kill you. -Not if I kill you first. -Circle up, team meeting. We've got to chat. All right, I'm gonna cut to the chase. That match was horrendous. With zero hyperbole, it was a hate crime against people with eyes. We need to get back to the basics. Get to know each other. I wanna know, what are your favorite games? We'll play them together and then we can incorporate those skills into this team. I'm gonna go first. All right, well, I'm Parker. I am a former video game designer turned teacher. I'm a lapsed feminist and I like to stay close to gaming even though, it really hurts me. Mmm. Who's next? Hi, I-- I'm Sloane. And I'm a gamer. Hi, Sloane. Gaming is my escape. It's where I go when I wanna feel like a superhero, you know. Yeah, that's great. That's really good. I didn't even touch a controller before my accident. But I met an awesome community online and, um, they helped me start a Patreon, so I could get my life back to normal. Well, as normal as I could. Starting with off-campus housing and, uh, hand controls, so I can drive again. Went alone for spring break, bitches. -Yeah, yeah. I used to play my Game Boy all day when my dad and I would ride dolphins from Miami to Cuba. Yeah. And then I found out two months ago, that wasn't really my dad. One time, I took too much ecstasy at an all-night rave and woke up tied to an RV dressed like a fairy. I had so much glitter in my vagina, when I queefed, -it was like a Kesha concert down there. -Yeah, that happened. -It was so awesome. -Okay. Thanks, Diane. -That's nice. Fun stuff. Glad I went first. Wow. Okay, let's train. Cue music. We're going to train mentally, spiritually, physically. We're gonna sharpen those reflexes. Work on our communication with one another. -Come on, I need some help. -Boost our confidence. And most importantly, the trust that you have in one another. -Because as things currently stand... -you have a zero-percent chance of winning. -Great pep talk. It's time to show me your killer instincts. Because I want to get them out of your heads and get you into theirs. -Dick-mopper. -Bastard. Suck tank, you filthy cuck! Now, remember to keep it simple. The number-one objective is to destroy the enemy's orb. -Dang it. -Nice backhand! -Get ya on the next one, though. -Lilly, who are you talking to? Go, Tommy! Go, Timmy! Go, Tommy! Go, Timmy! I'm gonna disembowel you and jump rope with your large intestine. And once I've led the cops away from your scent, I will feed your guts to my pet unicorn while crafting a necklace out of your teeth! ♪ What we're up against, what ♪ ♪ This is, this is what... ♪ Is he wearing Axe body spray?

Wait, that was my favorite game when I was a kid. It's also one of the hardest titles ever made. To beat it, you have to let opportunities present themselves to you, instead of just diving in headfirst. Patience isn't exactly your strong suit, V. If you can learn how to take a breath, assess all of your options, you could become a better player. And a better teammate. Hmm. Cool. All right, we got 'em. Let's go. What? Ooh, these dudes can't take me tonight, girl. Go, go, go! -They're coming from the left. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get 'em. Yes, queen! -Nice. -Whoo. Good job, babe. Oh, shoot. Um, it's Owen. -Um, for our gaming date. -Cavorting with the enemy, really? No, no, no, he's harmless. -Is this a male? -Yes. Oh, my God, he is cute. You are talking to this boy? V, this is progress!

I know you got it... in you. -In you? Hmm. -Okay. -I get it, thank you. -Is that-- Hmm. Nope, you're-- you're good. You can go now. -Oh, my God, get away from me.

Hi. -Hey, Owen. -Hi. -What's up? -Do you need a moment or...? -No. No, I'm good. Indigo, get out! Get out. Um, should we start gaming? Uh, sure. Yeah, not-- not judging. After you. Ooh, quite the gentlemen. Milady. -All right, let's do this. -Okay, I got the guy on the left. I got him. -See that guy? -Yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it. Night-night. -Leave some for me. -Only if you can keep up. Oh, that kid was trash. -That's yours? -Yep, I got it. Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo! I'm gonna hide over here and then you can jump out. -Now, now, now. Go, go, go. -Okay, I got it. -Yeah, send it. -All right. -Boom. There we go. -That guy got smoked. -All right, that's you, that's you. Well, look at that. You get a nap and you get a nap. Yeah, that's yours. He's trash. He's trash. -Get it. -Get it. -Get it. -Get it. -Get it! Let's go! Come on. -Yes! -Whoo! You know, you're not bad at this game, Owen. -There's a reason why I'm ranked higher than you. -Whatever. Ooh, ooh, ooh, mine! No. Mine! Too slow, buddy. I like the way you slay. You're not so bad yourself. -It's, uh-- It's been nice to just play, you know? -Yeah. Feel like lately I'm forced to game like my life depends on it. And I guess it kind of does. For the record, I love the damage we do as teammates. Oh, what could have been. We spent a lot of time together at practice, but we never actually spent time together, you know? I do know. I totally know, yeah. We should do it more. But, like, in person. Totally, I-- I'd like that. That-- That'd be nice. And thank you. For what? For not being one of the bad guys. So, uh, I'm gonna go. Right, yeah. Uh, okay. Well, it was, uh, good to see you. -Bye, Owen. -All right.

After seeing you in action and learning your strengths, I've got a plan. Sloane, you're our new support. You need to protect our carry. You're here to serve. -Like bottoming? -Yes. Jenna, you're our carry. High damage, low defense. Dish pain from a distance, but never get caught alone. We need you for every single team fight. -Sweet abs. -I'd do him. All right, focus.

Your mission: absorb their front line. -All right. -Do not lose a tower and be ready for those team fights. Rum-pum-pum, pum-pum, pum. And V, cast from the middle. -Guard the Axis, you're our quarterback. -These are all new roles. Is this really the time to experiment with our champions and positions? If you wanna win, you have to adapt. What's it gonna be? Oh, he's on my ass. He's freaking eating my ass right now. God. Lilly, he is mining my Moria. -Okay, you're on me. -All ready. Three, two, one, yes! Taste the rainbow, bitch! -Yeah, that was so good. -That was awesome. -Yes. -Dude, we can't give these chicks the satisfaction. -We're not going to. -Keep up the tempo, you've got 'em. -Losing con-- I c-can't... -Did they just pull their own plug? -We lost power. Hey, a win's a win. All right, guys, let's go. One, two, three. Hand jobs. -Forget about 'em. Let's go. -I just-- I kill myself. -You nailed it! -What are they doing here? Come on, that's it. High energy. Let's get those builds going, guys. Guys, less floating around. Defense. -Going mid. -I'll go left. -I got my full build. Let's go. -Commit. Commit. All right, let's keep it together, guys. Come on. They're all over me right now, guys. Somebody please come to the middle right now. V, V, I don't see you. -No! -Whoo, yes! -So sad. -Lilly, we need wards to see where they are. Okay, I'm on it. Surprise. I'm going to chop your head off and I'm gonna eat your arm for breakfast. It's gonna be so delicious. -Oh, my God! All right, all right, all right. Get it. Don't let them take our tower. Let's go, let's go. Dang it. They've cleared out our jungle of minions. Hey, where's our defense? Guess it's time for offense. V, don't drift to the top. You're in my lane, V. V, the game plan. Don't force it. V, we need you back in the middle. Trust me, I've got eyes on the orb. Seriously, we need you over here. Relax, I've got this. -Shit. -Yeah, that's right. -Guys, they're all over us. They're gonna take the orb. -Come on, we got this. -No, no, no. -God. So close. -So close. -Gonna cry. "8-Bits"? 0-Bits. Well, how am I supposed to be dealing damage when absolutely nobody is covering me? Well, I don't know. Jenna was there. -Yeah, Jenna was asleep at the wheel. -Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, tiger. This was not bad at all. -There were some solid combos. -Combos? Who cares? We just got snowballed by those ass-goblins. Yeah, no shit, maybe stop playing for yourself, Dustin. All right, all right, everyone, just get dressed, okay. We can talk about this outside. V, a word? -Yeah. -You care to tell me what the hell you're doing out there? -I was trying to win the game. -Not for us, you weren't. Look, the game plan that I put into place did not call for you playing hero. Your impatience let the whole team down. Are we done? We will be, you wanna keep going rogue. Hi. How's it going? -Good. -Walk with me. Uh, you're not recording me, are you? -What, no. -Okay, good, good. Yeah, so, uh, been informed that your little team's making some waves around here on campus. Also been informed that what I told you before, I was not allowed to tell you. I got sat down with the athletic director and a board of trustees and we went over the situation here at Barrett and I've come to the conclusion they don't know what the hell they're talking about. But I've been forced to make some changes, and come next year, Barrett will be only funding one eSports team, which means it's either you or the Betas, which probably means it's the Betas, right? What about my scholarship? Yeah, uh, well, unless you win, I would be forced to cancel that, which makes me sad. But doesn't rock the boat which makes me happy. Wait, if we win on Tuesday, then we'll make it to the national championships. Get real, I did my research. You're playing the Kansas City Kong, the second-ranked eSports team in the nation. Good luck. Toodle-oo. Girl power, everybody. Let's go! Girl power! So, you're saying we have to beat the Kong, or we're kicked out of Barrett forever. My life as I know it is toast. Wait, the Dean can't just cancel us like that, right? Why not? He's totally out to get me. -Us. Out to get us. -Whatever, sure, Sloane. Okay, look, we need to double up on practices, all right? I can't. I have work study. Yeah, I'm maxed too, V. If I don't log those 30 streaming hours a week, I lose my sponsors and news flash, I like money. -Yeah, V, I barely have time to take a dump. -Oh, my God. Did you guys know sea otters hold hands while they're sleeping to prevent themselves from drifting apart. -Aw... -Oh. Really? -Yeah. -That's so cute. What planet are you all on? Jesus Christ, V! It's not just about you. -Never said it was. -You literally just said that. Look around, V, this is your clan! This is what we always wanted, a team. Yeah. I understand that. But it all goes away, if I don't go to the championship. Okay? I have everything riding on this scholarship. You don't understand-- I don't understand? My scholarship is on the line too, and yet somehow you're the one complaining about how unfair the world is to you. Are you guys about to fight? Because if so, I would love to livestream this. -So, if you guys could start that dialogue over-- -Cut the cameras, Professor X. -Okay, say that again, giant! -Fee-fi-fo-fum! -You and your stupid influencing. -Hey, hey, stop fighting, guys! Hey, no one cares about your followers, Jenna! Enough! Stop! This is not okay! Wow. Just-- Everyone, take a deep breath. You're all taking this team for granted. We need to start from the beginning, young Jedi. Sorry, technically, we'd be called "Padawans". Padawans it is. Whoa, she has a garage here? All right, I don't come back here anymore. But I think it's time to share with you guys. -Oh, my God. Parker, you've been totally holding out on us. I think I just lost my mind. I think I just creamed my cords. Look at all these ancient games, guys. It's like a museum. -Let's, uh-- Let's play it and not impregnate it. Turtles. And ninjas. Ninja Turtles is literally the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup of heroes. Only the best coin-operated team game of all time. Contra. My dad used to play this with me all the time. It was his favorite. Oh, it's a classic, too. Wait... Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start. Everyone, listen up. It is time to reignite the fire inside of you like you're a kid again. Or a Padawan. Play till your fingers bleed. Awesome. Whoo! Yeah! Go, Sloane. Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! -Hit that. -Chug the mug! -Oh, God! Chug, chug, chug. Yeah! Yeah! Go, Sloane! Whoo! -I am a rock god! We killed that one, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. GoldenEye. "License to Kill" scenario. Ho. Halt, knave! How dare you blow on the cartridge! Moisture in your breath will rust the game. Oh, please! How about slappers-only mode, no guns, just good old-fashioned slapping the shit out of each other. -Put it in. -Ooh, okay. -Dibs on Oddjob. -Dibs on Boris. -Who wants to play? -I do. You Soviets are going down. I wouldn't get too close if I were you. I've got a couple of colorful ghosts to avoid-- in this game and, metaphorically, from my past. Hmm, wow. That's deep. Oh, yeah, I'm a little buzzed. Well, so, when you were googling me, did you happen to read that I dropped out of Barrett after I sold my first game? -Wow. -And look at me now. I am almost 40, and I'm still trying to figure out how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man bone. 'Cause there's a Pac-Man Jr. so it has to have happened. So, you, didn't share in that first day of practice? I remember. What made you fall in love with gaming? Well, I wasn't allowed to game, growing up. Took a while to break my parents. They still don't tolerate my obsession. Um, my dad calls me a loser, who's going nowhere in life. Yeah, so if I don't win, I'm gonna have to go home and apologize for following my dreams. We have to win on Tuesday, Parker. -Lilly... -Hey, we said no guns. -Uh, just a... Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. Who's seen The Wizard? Like Wizard of Oz? -Fred Savage. -Who? Video Armageddon! -Guys, it's a classic. Really? -Ugh. All right, well, let's watch it. -Yeah, okay. Turn it on. -Yes? -Sure. -Come on, sourpuss. Let's cheer you up. -Let's see him beat that. -Okay, I like this movie. -Told you. -Um, I thought it was gonna be cringe, but it's actually pretty dope. Can't believe they made a movie about people who play video games. This movie's so wizard. What is he? Some kind of freak or something? That's it. -Hey! You conned me. -I didn't. I won the bet. Uh, guys, I'll be right back. You do not want to miss this part. -I think this is the part where Fred gets savage. -Mmm. V, wait, where are you going? V! What are we even doing? We're wasting time. -We're bonding, we're letting loose. -I wanna go pro. I don't have anything else and you guys are in there dry-humping old pinball machines. When I fell off Rainbow Road, you know what I said? I said, "Lakitu, I don't even need another life." I let that red shell just knock me right off my track. Lakitu, red shells? You're drunk! What's your point? Look, I-- What I'm trying to say is just don't do what I did, V. Don't assume you can do this all on your own. You've got a team and they love you. And if you're pushing away the people that love you, then what happens if you, with gaming-- You can't even enjoy it with anybody. You will regret it. I know I did. It's cold.

She doesn't look okay to me. I don't know. I got it. All right, come on, guys. We got this. Keep those health bars up. Let's go! Eyes on the prize, guys. There you go Sloane, keep up the pressure. Psst! Hey. Enjoy my back-alley lobotomy, bitch. -Sweet combo. -Milady. No mercy for the weak, Diane. -Easy, Cobra Kai! -Back off, pencil dick. Crap, I'm low. Got you covered, Diane. Okay, focus, everyone. What the hell? V, stay in your lane. Whatever you say, Sloane. -Oh, my God! -Damn it, V, that guy came from your lane. Use your ultimate. Now, it's up! An ally has been slain. V, defend the tower. V, get over here. We need you. Get off my back. Stop farming minions and help. V, help your team out. V, come on. -Focus the healer. Take the shot. -On it. Follow me, boys. This healer thinks she can outrun us. Coming, just keep coming. Come meet my friend. Wait, what are you doing? Sloane? An enemy has been slain. Come on, finish the job. -Kill her. -Nice kill. An enemy has been slain. Someone had to bring the game to you. Avenge me. -Get him, V. -He's the only one left. Guys, she's right there. Kill her! Come on, V. Come on, Kong. Got 'em on the ropes. I think V's gonna make it. -V, come on. -You can do it, V. No, no, no, no! An enemy has been slain. Go, V, you got it! -Go, go, go. -You're almost there, almost there. -Come on, V. -Oh! Yes! -Oh, my God. -Oh shit. -Yeah! -Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. We're going to finals. We're going to finals. 8-Bits, 8-Bits, 8-Bits! Last game, my ass. Um, what are you doing here? I got your email. My email? What? Roommates share everything, V, even passwords. Oh, you catfished me. I'm out. Wait, wait, wait, please. I hate seeing you two fighting. Can you just stay for a minute, please. I made tea. Indigo. And cookies. -Cookies. -Cookies? -Fine. -One cup. Very well. Heard about the big win. Everyone's talking about it. Gotta say, it was dope. -V avenged me. -After Sloane's sacrifice. Mm-hmm. Next stop, nationals. Hard to believe, right? We came a long way from riding pine for the dick-smacked Betas. Did you ever get a sneaking suspicion that they whacked off to us? -What, no! -Oh, totally, they did. Get out! I'd break those dweebs in two. I think Adi is super into you. -Adi? -Mm-hmm. That guy smells like cheese. I feel kind of funny. Yeah, my, like, heart's racing. -No. -What did you do to me? Let the waves envelop this spiritual reunion. You need to open up, V. Like an ayahuasca trip. -But you're not a shaman. -Trust me. I watched this amazing Hulu doc on it. -Don't fight it. Feel it. Bonjour! Je m'appelle Pierre! More cookies! Le jump, le bounce. Eh, boing, boing, boing. Look at me. I'm so soft. Yay! Ping! Oopsie, poopsie. -So long. Stay friends. Au revoir! Hey, you dropped some change down here. My work here is done. I'm sorry I was so rude to you. There's just so much pressure to succeed, and prove everyone wrong. There's no room to just be. If anyone gets that, it's me. And I'm a trans woman living in the Midwest. There's literally more Starbucks where I come from than there are people like me. I know what it feels like to not be what everyone expects. Well, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect. Hello! I'm back, baby. Surprise! Such good friends. Oh! Thank you. Olivera Suites is proud to welcome collegiate gamers -from across the nation. Attention gamers, team check-in is on the mezzanine level. -Yeah! Oh, look who it is. Apparently, they let anyone in here. The Harry Potter convention is next weekend. T-T-T-Trolls in the lobby. Oh, Ginny Weasley, love your work. Whatever. Ginny gets to kiss Harry. If they put the sorting hat on you, you'd be placed in House Bitch. You know, it's really a shame you won't be coming back in the fall. -You two were the best subs the Betas ever had. They just keep lowering that glass ceiling for you all, don't they? Dude, raising the glass ceiling. Yeah, nice one, Ri-chodo. Actually, I have a secret to tell you. Wanna step a little closer? Ricardo. But I like secrets. -Yeah, come here. -Like here? -Yeah, a little bit. -Okay. -Oh, God, no, no, not again. No! Not again. Not again. -Diane, hold your mouth. -Out of here, out of here. -I drank a bottle of vinegar and ate a tablespoon of baking soda. It's like an eighth grade science fair in here. Ugh, nasty, Diane. My stomach's really hurting. Can we go to the room? I need to really use the toilet immediately. Hey everyone, I'm Kelsey Impicciche. I'm here at the national finals in Miami and the energy here is insane. What are you hoping to see? -Destruction, carnage, slaughter. -I wanna see more wombo combos. -I'm hoping for some surprise games. -What game are they playing? What does it take to win a team competition like this? -Stamina. -Hunger. -Experience. -Plenty of quarters. You gotta keep on filling those machines up. Do you have any early predictions? -Super Mario, am I right? -Barrett all the way! Well, the Newburn Sakka made it all the way to the finals last year. So, odds are they can do it again. Welcome to the National eSports Championships, presented by Mercedes-Benz. Good luck. Ranked number ten in the nation and runner-up at last year's tournament, -give a massive welcome to the Newburn Sakka! -Yeah, yeah, whoo! It's a madhouse out there. Yeah, talk about a baptism by fire. And their opponents, seeded dead last, and the only all-women's team in the tournament... -All right, you're up. Listen, you got this. -Thanks. -Let's go. You can do it! -See you out there, Jenna. Give it up for the 8-Bits from Barrett University! Oh, yeah, we wanna hear you. We wanna hear you. Let's go. Yeah, whoo! Oh, my goodness. Let's get started! And the game begins. In three, two, one. There's no room for error today. It's win or game over. Whoo! Let's go. -Damn, these guys are good. -It's like fighting a hive mind. An ally has been slain. That's it. That's it, guys. Good work, good work. Sakka takes an early lead and pivots up-lane. Right, just a little backup right there. Newburn wastes little time and goes straight for the jugular. Shit! He's on me. He's on me. He's on me. -Yes! An enemy has been slain. -Crap, that was close. -Sorry. Hey, V, come on. Communicate. -Oh, yeah! Suck it, ladies! Sorry, small objects are a choking hazard. Burn! That's my girl! -Ah! I need a little help down here. -All right, good work. You're playing five different games out there. Work together! -Okay, okay, I'm coming. An ally has been slain. -Dang it! -Nice kill, nice kill. It's dire out there for Barrett. They just can't break through the Newburn defense. Oh, you wanna do this? Fine. Yeah, come on down. That's it, good, good. Whoo! Leeroy Jenkins! -No, no, no. That's a good one. Major move by the Barrett champion Narbash. Creates an opening in the mid lane. An enemy has been slain. Hey, she's making a run for it, guys! Back to the orb! A surprise advance by the 8-Bits captain. She has swooped into the open lane. Don't do it, V. Don't do it. I need some help here. Come on. Sakka scrambles to block her path. Wait, she just reversed direction. Come at me, bros! Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys! Go after her! Two Newburn champions have abandoned their positions -to hunt her down. -That's it, that's it, come on! Is this a suicide mission? 'Cause it sure looks like it. -Yeah, we got you, V. We got you. -What are you doing? Sakka are hot on her heels. A big kill! They have eliminated the 8-Bits captain. I've cleared the path. You got this. Now avenge me. Okay. Wait a minute! The 8-Bit captain's sacrifice exposed Sakka's backdoor! Regroup, come on. Come on, boys, back to the orb. Back to the orb. Come on, Slo! -Don't look back. You got it. Will they catch her in time? She's charging through the mid lane! -No, no, no, come on! It's up for grabs now. -They did it! She's taken the orb! -Yes! Yes! Whoo! -That's how it's done! The 8-Bits advance, giving us the first upset of this tournament. This match is down to the wire. What a win! Going, going, and gone! -The Cleveland Clerics just got Cleveland steamed. There's no stopping Narbash. She's taking out the trash. Suck my glove, chode. -Whoo, yes! -Barrett moves on to the semifinals. The questionable gesturing being displayed does not represent the views of this tournament. What a match! Are the 8-Bits the real deal? Absolutely! -Who are the 8-Bits? -The all-girl team. Yeah, I don't-- I don't see gender. Oh, my heart screams the 8-Bits, -but my brain's telling me... -The Betas! I'm gonna say no. Is that okay to say no? The Betas are going to the championships for the second time in two years. Uh, yeah, I mean, was there any doubt? Come on. And it looks like your rivals, the 8-Bits, are just one victory away from joining you. Yeah, well, their luck's about to run out, so, ticktock, ticktock. Well, the rumor is that the losing Barrett team will not be receiving eSports scholarships next year. Are you worried? Kelsey, I'm-- I'm-- I'm not worried about that. I'm about as worried about that as global warming, okay. It doesn't exist. We've been undefeated this entire season and whoever we're up against, we're gonna annihilate. So, uh, go, Betas. Go, Betas. Go, Betas. And, uh, I'll see you out there. Whoo! It's a regular David and Goliath matchup here in this semifinal. The 8-Bits are a scrappy bunch, but if Poughkeepsie plays their game they should make short work of these overachievers from Barrett. Shut up! All right, focus. Oh, this chicken. Lilly, what are you doing? What the hell? Is that a chicken? Well, I like his pretty feathers and his sharp talons, and his cute little beak! You've never played that character before. Did you honestly go full chicken? You never go full chicken, Lilly! -Lilly! -Parker said I could. Go with it. Adapt, remember. Someone's gonna get Kentucky Fried. Three, two, one. Here we go! And the semifinals are underway. Stick together as a squad, guys. Let's hit 'em hard. The Polygons have come out strong, showcasing their early strategy by dealing some impressive damage to the 8-Bits carry lane. -Oh, my God! -Good job, good job. A quick first kill. Keep your head in the game, guys. Come on! The Polygons have eliminated the 8-Bits' support and are pushing into the mid lane. Come on, consolidate, ladies. Defense! Where is everyone? -Ally has been slain -Come on! -Double kill. We are dead. We're all dead. -Two more 8-Bits bite the dust. -Okay. The Polygons are dominating the 8-Bits and smell blood. There's one left. Let's get her. Hey! Snap out of it! Focus. And V sneaks away... -Find her! All right. She's evaded the Polygons for now, but she's low on health. There she is, I see her. She's in the jungle. Let's go! The Polygons are back on the scent. Ooh! And a brutal hit. On me, on me, on me. We got her now. -Oh, my God. -Oh, my God. -What the hell is that, a chicken? Ooh! Look at that, the 8-Bits are back. Lilly, the orb! Go! It's yours. Okay! Kill her! Go... Fuck that chicken. ♪ My dreams are getting So strange ♪ ♪ I'd like to tell you Everything I see ♪ ♪ Oh, I see a man in the back As a matter of fact ♪ ♪ His eyes are as red As the sun ♪ ♪ And the girl in the corner Let no one ignore her ♪ ♪ 'Cause she thinks She's the passionate one ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah It was like lightning ♪ ♪ Everybody was frightening ♪ ♪ And the music was soothing ♪ ♪ And they all Started grooving ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ -All you! -I won. -Yeah. -The chicken wins!

Wow. -I quit. -Jeff? Same, I quit. Geoff? What are we gonna do? -Hi! -We can get them canceled. -Guys, we can't cancel them. They're uncancelable. Oh. We could play the long game and get them hooked onto crystal meth. -My stepdad knows-- -Guys, we need something tonight! Yeah, we need some Tonya Harding shit. Yeah. Wait, no. Maybe. Hey. You know, I think I got a plan. Hi. Thank you. Keep the change. Have a good one. Girlies. Hell yeah. Huzzah. And meet my sisters in arms. The 8-Bits. I am only as strong as the goddesses you see on your screen. Can you believe it? Nope. But I believe in all of you. Hell yeah. I did it. What the hell is that? Freeze! Don't move! Hands in the air! Everyone do it now! Hands up! You're all under arrest. -Can I stream this? -No! -Right, you got it. Is the coast clear? Open the door. It's the police. Trust me, you do not want me to open the door. Open the door or we're coming through. I really don't think that's a good idea. Open it. Keep your hands where I can see them. It's just my Charmin. It's ultra soft. Whoa, Jesus God. -What is that smell? -I'm so sorry. -Oh, you poor thing. -I didn't wipe yet. Oh, get back in there and clean up. Great, can they leave now? Terrorist threats are no prank, ma'am. Including what your Charmin queen did to the bathroom last night. -Uh, I heard that. -Yeah, we smelled that. Yeah, and you're gonna see that. Skid mark right down the chair! It was a hoax. They were swatted. You've really never heard of that? Of course, I've heard of it but we still have to clear their names. Can I just get a real cop? -Ma'am? -Sir? -It appears that your team is free to go. -What a surprise! -Except for you. -That is a surprise. What? -Apparently, an account registered in your name hacked into the Minecraft e-store for infinite credits. Does that ring any bells? -Mom, I can totally explain. -Mm-hmm. You're gonna have to stay here until we sort this out. -Uh, can I have a minute with my team? -Sure. All right guys, you have 30 minutes to get this team onto the field -and prepare for war, you understand? -Yeah. Uh, all right. So I know I'm always harping on about how gaming needs to change but this team is proof that it already has. You're a bunch of absolute wackadoodle weirdos, and you're brilliant and I believe in each and every one of you. All right. To teamwork. To sacrifice. -To vengeance. -Love. Acceptance. Family. One, two, three... 8-Bits! -Whoo! -Knock 'em dead. Wait, really? You finished it? Sure did. Took Robo-Manus down like a punk. Full disclosure, I uh, never beat this one myself. When you came into my house, I was scared. I saw a version of what I could have been if I hadn't given up. You win this, you win it for both of us. Good luck. Thanks. Proud of you. Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like the Barrett 8-Bits are a no-show. -Where's V? -I-- I don't know. They're moments away from forfeiting the national championship. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... Oh, no! Oh, no. Here they come. ♪ Oh, my God ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm a beast Where you at? I've been unleashed ♪ -We have a match! ♪ 'Cause I'm a beast Where you at? ♪ ♪ I've been unleashed What you doing? ♪ Let's go. Who's ready to crown a new national champion? Looks like we're gonna have to get our hands dirty today after all, boys. Oh, do we have a grudge match today! To say these two teams dislike each other is the understatement of the century. -Go, V! -Whoo! Okay, ladies, listen up. No matter what they say or do, we stick to our game. -Let's win this for Parker. -Hell yeah. -Got it. -Whoo! Three, two, one. -Here we go! Both teams appear to be choosing standard builds, and sadly, no more chickens. Come on, ladies. Right out of the game, the 8-Bits are applying some serious pressure as the first minion waves collide. No! -Whoo! First kill of the night, baby. With a quick first kill, the 8-Bits are in the lead. -Keep it up, girls. -All right, let's go, boys. -You shall not pass! -No! -Oh, you wet rat bitch! -Oh, how do you like that? It looks like Narbash has been Nar-smashed. Sloane, probe the line. Lilly, show no mercy. -Roger that. -No problem. And what's this? Kallari, pouncing out from the jungle on a pair of unsuspecting Betas. Shit. Eat it. Ooh, that poor child was ganked in the jungle. The Betas have quickly evened up the playing field. All right, regroup, regroup. 8-Bits, 8-Bits... 8-Bits, 8-Bits, 8-Bits, 8-Bits... Go, V! Go! V, take my lead. Got it. -Hey, Dustin's all alone, it's three-on-one. -My favorite. Shit, they're all over me. Where are you guys? The reigning champs are on the ropes. If the Betas don't rally, they will lose their title. I got you, Captain. About time. -That was brutal. -No! That wombo combo just decimated the 8-Bits. -Now, that's some real support. -Support this. After the two teams trade killing blows, we're down to just the captains. Without the support of her team, the 8-Bits captain is turning tail and fleeing the mid lane. Keep running. Keep trying to run. Come on, attack me! You can run all day. -Ha! Shit! You got this. Patience, V. Wait. Wait for it. Now! -Yes! Yes! The 8-Bits win! The 8-Bits win! They've won the title! Yes! Whoo! That game was bullshit! Each and every one of you is replaceable. Why didn't you do what you were told? Hey. Good game. Congratulations, support. -Keep walking, Ricardo. -No touching. Mercedes-Benz proudly presents your new national eSports champions, the Barrett University 8-Bits! We did it, girls! Yes! 8-Bits, 8-Bits... -V! -We did it! -Look at that thing. -Owen, hey. Congrats, you guys killed the Betas out there. -And you didn't play. -As much as I would have loved to have gotten my ass kicked by you, I couldn't be the good guy if I kept playing with the bad guys. So, I did a lot of thinking about it and, you know, I... -Ooh. -Ah. Yeah, the cup's in the way. Well, that was a moment lost. -Here we go. -Whoa. -Sloane, can you take this? -Roger that. Wow. You owe me 50 bucks. -Oh, move, man. -Police, out of the way! Stop! You're under arrest! What is happening? -Stop struggling. -Get off me! You think false threats are funny? Damn it! That was Ricardo! I didn't do it! -No! -Show mercy. -It was Ricardo! -V, it's an honor to meet you. I work with Mercedes-Benz. How would you feel about us sponsoring your team? -Like at Barrett? -I was thinking pro. We're also throwing in a GLA 250 for each member of the team. Oh, my God!
