RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Chloe? We're out of potatoes. I've got some more right here. Here. I made a few extra trays last night. Of course you did. You know, you are aware you can take a break. You've been here since 6:00. I'm good, Fred, thanks. I gotta get to work soon, anyway. All right. Wait, wait! See? This is how you do it. - Bon appetit. - That's right. Cheers! Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks, Monica. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Hey, Mom! Oh, good heavens, can it be? Is that really my daughter, Chloe, gracing us with her presence? I thought we were gonna have lunch this week. I know. I'm sorry. I just started volunteering at the thrift store now too and I just... haven't had a break. What about tomorrow? I'm taking Savannah out for a few hours. - Friday? - Homeless shelter. Mom, this is the busiest time of my entire years. There's a lot of people in need. I just worry. I'll be fine, Mom. I promise. Well, can you at least spare your mother a second to try my new holiday hot chocolate? Okay. Charlotte Bennett can eat her heart out at this year's competition. You wait and see. Here. Thanks. Hoo-hoo! - All right. Try this. - Okay. Nutmeg. - Cinnamon, too? - Yeah. There's no way I come in second place again. Not a chance. Hey, Mom, I gotta get to work. So you still have a paying job, then? - Funny. - Listen, don't forget, your sister comes back home tomorrow. Yeah, I'll be by to see her. Bye, Mom. - Chloe? - Yeah? You know... those people who are in need around here are lucky to have you. Well, we'll have lunch when we can. Thanks, Mom. I love you. I love you. Come on, heater. You have one job to do. Please be a sport. Hey, Doug! Got your text. Hey! I have a new case for ya. Captain Michael Fischer. Been out about a month. Honorably discharged. But apparently, he's a tough nut to crack. How so? It's nothing serious, but he's refused any counseling from our department. Well, it is voluntary. Not if his liaison feels that he's exhibiting difficulty transitioning back into civilian life. It's all in there, and he has an appointment with you at 1400. Okay. Let's see. Food bank at 1:00 That's 1300. - Homeless shelter at 4:00. - 1600. That... that should work. Well, I'm glad to know you can fit us in. This is your actual paying job, taking care of these veterans returning and helping them transition back into civilian life. Thank you for clarifying that. Do you not think I'm doing a good job? Quite the contrary. You're the best counselor we have. I'm just worried that you might be taking on a little too much volunteer work. Have you been talking to my mother? Look, how long have you been out? - Just over a year. - Right. Now, I know that this was just a transitional job, but... have you considered staying with our department permanently? Quite frankly, I'd hate to lose you. These wounded soldiers won't just listen to anyone. Thank you, and I guess I just haven't really given it much thought. I'm still trying to figure out the rest of my life. Well, fair enough. In the meantime, take care of Captain Fischer. If anybody can get through to him, it's you. Thanks, Doug. He's late. 55... Hi, this is Michael Fischer. Sorry I missed your call. Give me a message and I'll get back to you. No. Okay. Let's go. Are you Michael Fischer? Howdy. May I help you? Well, for starters, you could've shown up to your appointment. Hi, Chloe Marquee. I work for the Soldier's Transition Center over at the Army base. Right. That was today. - 2 o'clock. - My apologies. Yeah... Lost track. - Drove all the way out here? - Yes, I did. And I have a very busy schedule, so I would like to get started. Well, I'm, sorry for wasting your time, Chloe, but I told my liaison that... I'm not in need of any guidance, advice, or counseling, so... Yeah, we, get that a lot. According to your file, though, you've been isolating yourself. You haven't been participating in any activities. And you haven't found a job yet, either. I've been deployed overseas for most of the last 10 years. I have no family. My friends have moved on or still deployed overseas. And... just haven't found the right job. - Well, it still might help... - I'm fine. Honestly, I appreciate the concern. Watch yourself. You know, sometimes it might be harder than you might think. You know, veterans have to learn new skills, provide for their well-being. Military life is structured with very clear objectives. Civilian life, not so much. I mean, someone in your situation, for example, has to create a whole new social community. Do I? I kind of like my social community. Look, no one's forcing you to do this. I'm just here to help. And I'm surprisingly good at it. Well, I will... I'll keep that in mind. In the meantime, is there any paperwork I can sign off on or...? Why did you leave the Army? I got a busy day, too. I appreciate you checking in on me. Hey. Call me, okay? Hi, Merry Christmas! Thank you, the kids are gonna be so happy. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. For the kids? Hi. Okay, so that should be the last one. And here are the delivery instructions. - Thank you. - Of course. - Hi, Chloe, how's it going? - Great, General O'Toole. The trucks are packed, the boxes are full. Another successful food drive. I really appreciate you doing this every year, Chloe. - We couldn't do it without you. - Of course. By the way, the young girl you are mentoring? Savannah, yeah. Yes, your request to have her parents, Captains Olivia and Toby Goodmanson, home for Christmas... So I spoke to General Worthington. He's trying to pull some strings. But their deployments are difficult. I just don't want everyone to get their hopes up. Well, I haven't said a word to Savannah. And I... I just thought it was worth a try. Well, I haven't given up just yet. You know, General, the toy drive. You know, ever since I've gotten to know Savannah, I found there's even more children who need our help. I know, but I don't think there's gonna be a toy drive - this year. - Wait, why? Well, Ben Johnson has left MWR and no one took his place. So other charities will be getting the funds. But in some cases, it's the only gift these kids will get. I know, but the program is just stretched pretty thin. Position is yours if you wanna try to get it back on track. Me? Oh, General, I mean, I... I... I couldn't possibly. I mean, I don't have a minute left in the day as it is. I understand. Maybe some other organization will fill the gap. Okay, I'll... I will do it. I can do it. I will find the time. That is fantastic. You really are a go-getter. I'm sorry the Army has lost you as a soldier. Chloe! Oh, Savannah! Hey, Aunt Dottie. Hi! It's the best part of her day - when she gets to see you. - Mine too. Okay, do you wanna put up some decorations around town? Yes! All right. Have fun! - Bye, Aunt Dottie. - Bye, Auntie! Hey, put that seatbelt on. Hey. Thank you. Why aren't you married? - What? - My auntie really likes you. So do my mom and dad. And I heard them say that they can't believe someone hasn't snatched you up. I don't know. I guess I just haven't found the right guy? - Do you even have a boyfriend? - Honestly? I... I don't have time for a boyfriend, okay? So next subject. What is on your Christmas list? Oh, come on, there's gotta be something. - It's your mom! - Yes! Hi! - Mommy! - Hi, sweetie! - Hi, Chloe! - Hi! - How are you? - Great! We're putting up decorations. Chloe, we can't thank you enough. Of course. It's my pleasure. Well, most of the time. Are you and Daddy coming home for Christmas? No, sweetie, we talked about this. You know how much we both wanna be there. I know. It's okay. - I miss you. - I miss you too, Mommy. So much. I'll let the two of you get back to the fun, and I'll call later. Daddy said he's gonna call, too. Okay. Bye, Mommy. Bye! Chloe, Chloe, do you think my mom and dad will fit inside - Santa's sleigh? - Yeah. I mean, I'm... I'm sure they could. But... I don't think it's gonna happen this year, sweetie. Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm sorry, honey. Well, hello. Hi. Picking up a few things in town, saw you were over here, thought I'd come say hello. I'm glad. This is Savannah. Savannah, this is Michael Fischer. - Hi. - She's my big sister. Both of her parents are deployed. Yes, right. I... well, truth is, I was actually... I was actually gonna call you. Maybe I could use some advice on adapting a little better. Well, then you've come to the right place. How about I start by showing you where to find the best hot chocolate in town? - Sounds great. - All right. Come on, Savannah, let's take a break. - Don't forget your bag. - Yes! Those two are down lower, so that's perfect. Yeah, okay. I think it looks nice. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Appreciate it. - Yeah. - Hey! - She does exist. - You're home early. I know. I was gonna call you. It's so great to see you, Chloe. You, too. Welcome home, Sis. Hi, honey. How are you, Savannah? Mom, this is Michael Fischer. He was just honorably discharged from the Army a month ago. Welcome home to you as well. - Why, thank you. - And my sister, Trish... Lieutenant Barns, First Armory Division. On leave just in time for the holidays. It's a pleasure meeting you both. I told him this is where he could find the best hot chocolate in town. Mom? The hot chocolate? Yeah, right. Excuse me. Savannah, it's been so long! Can I show you my patty cake? Yes, I have no idea what I'm doing. You'll get it one day. Thank you. - It's quite the tribute. - Yeah. This one here, that's... that's our dad. Your dad's in the Army, too? He passed away several years ago. But yes, we are a military family. Is that you? Six years. Honorable discharge last year. - Excuse me? - Yes? - Are you married? - Savannah! Please go help my mom with the hot chocolate. I'm sorry. It's okay. Can you tell me where to find the restroom? - Yeah, straight in the back. - Okay. Thank you. Let's go. Do tell. There's nothing to tell. I am his counselor and that's it. He's cute! Mom! How would you feel if every time I saw a middle-aged... ...young-ish looking gentleman, I tried to set you up with him? I'd thank you. You're telling me you're not even a little bit interested? No. You guys, it's work. Besides, I'm trying to figure out my life. I'm not even in that space. You know, sometimes you just have to let yourself feel - and... and... - You know, being vulnerable to the chemical reaction of a potential life partner means having my neuroreceptors up to filter out cortisol, adrenaline, and dopamine that draws one person to the other. And I have mentally disabled those receptors until I've accomplished certain things. How romantic. I don't believe in romance. It's all about chemistry. And like I said, I have that perfectly under control. - You need help. - Thanks. Here you go. My famous hot chocolate. All right, let's see. Okay... cinnamon and nutmeg? A man after my own heart! - Or my daughters. - Mom. Savannah, how would you like to help us set up some Christmas decorations? Sure! That way, Chloe and Michael could go for a walk. Yes! Come on, Savannah. It's... it's your family. So, what made you change your mind? What? About seeing you? I'm not sure I did change my mind. But I just... think I'm having a hard time admitting it hasn't been as easy adjusting as I thought it would be. Makes total sense. What you're missing right now is a sense of purpose, so... What do you like to do? Don't have a lot of hobbies. I like to read. But I don't know what I wanna do for work. What are you good at? I'm a good leader. Did a lot of electrical and mechanical work for the Army. You know, I... took a lot of training courses. Was the guy who fixed things around the base. Well, there you go. You can start your own business. I don't know. I feel like I need to leave all that behind me... everything associated with the Army, start fresh. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. So, what else did you do there? Well... the last few years, I didn't see much combat, so a lot of my energy went into helping them build more infrastructure, you know, better schools, libraries. That must've been so gratifying. Yeah, it was. How about you? Bagram. Yeah. There were some... there were some rough days and... I had a really hard time adjusting when I came home too, so... I get it. What's your purpose? What do you mean? I'm just... curious how you ended up, you know, helping soldiers transition and why you became a... a big sister. I have a... I have a funny feeling you probably work at a soup kitchen, too. Let me remind you that our objective is to find your purpose, not analyze mine. I'm on to something, aren't I? Okay, let's just focus on you, okay? Shall we get started tomorrow morning? Tomorrow morning. Great. I'll see you then. Marquee's an interesting last name. What does it mean? No great story. Other than we joke our name will always be up in lights. Bright lights at that, aren't they? Thanks for the hot chocolate. Of course. I'll see you tomorrow. No, General, I... I have to be... I have to be at the donation center by then. Are you sure it isn't too much? No, no, no, I can... I can handle it. Are you sure? The toy drive is my top priority. Okay. - Sir, can I call you back? - Of course. Okay. Bye bye. Yup. Yes. Did I miss another appointment? No, sorry. I had an idea. I couldn't wait. I... I get that way. What is this exactly? That is a... a program I organized that collected toys for all the kids in some of those villages. That's it! - What's it? - Every year, the Army has a toy drive for military families. But the man who headed it up is gone and they're prioritizing other charities. There's a lot of kids who are counting on those toys. Okay, but... I am putting you in charge. Welcome home, Michael Fischer. This is good. I can do this. Fantastic idea. I can't think of a better person to head this up. I was sorry to lose you among the ranks, Michael. You were a great soldier, a great leader. Thank you, General. I've often said the same thing about you, Chloe. I'm glad you're still part of the team. Me too. You'll have our full support. General, but there is a greater need than we thought. It's shocking how many military families live paycheck to paycheck. Something I would change if I had the power to do so. We don't wanna leave a single child out. Nor do I. But as I told you before, all of our funds have been allocated to other charities. So... what percentage of last year's budget can we count on? Half, I'm afraid. Logistical support will of course be no problem. But you'll have to raise the majority of your funds from outside sources. Okay, then that's just what we'll do. I want you try my hot chocolate again. I've made a few refinements. I'm leaving nothing to chance this year. Hot chocolate contest. A Christmas tradition around here. And Mom has yet to win. Well, I have a box full of silver medals. I want gold. It's political. I mean, you know, Charlotte Bennett knows the judges. Well, let's see here. Let me... see where we're at. That is better than the other one. That's because I get my cocoa beans directly from Ecuador. Charlotte buys hers at the supermarket. Well, you got my vote. I wish I could take it! These judges, they're just... three old fogeys that have had their wheels greased every year. I mean, it's just... it's not fair! Hey, Mom? You have customers waiting. All right. Well, enjoy! LJ, good to see you. The usual? She gets obsessed with this competition. I... I know it doesn't seem like it, but it's, it's all in good fun. I can... I can really tell you like being back, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I really enjoyed my time in the Army, but, I missed home. And being back here now, I... I really realize how lucky I am. How lucky we all are. Still, there's so many who aren't. Speaking of which, I made a list of potential donors... corporate, local businesses. And I'm gonna get the names of all the new children who we can include from the mentoring program. What? No, I just... I'm just trying to figure out how I fit into all this. Believe me, with my schedule, you're gonna be doing most of the legwork. Well, legwork is fine. I'm... you know, said you put me in charge... You are in charge. Okay, I'm... I get that way. Okay. This is officially your operation. There is a reason why I could not take this on. I've got way too much on my plate. Okay. Yes, this is great. Great. You know, actually... You know, it could be beneficial... If I could get your help getting this up... - ...and running... - Smoothly. Yeah. Well, I think... I think we've made a pretty good team so far. I mean, it'll all be that much more productive. At least until... It's all up and running smoothly. Right, yeah. You know... I've actually been thinking. If we're gonna use outside sources, then let's not limit this to just military families. Let's expand the program like you wanted, right? But to everyone, the entire community. That's a fantastic idea. Thank you. So... where do we start? To see if those outside sources are even necessary. All right. Can't tell you how hard I worked on getting this new community center. Almost 50 new jobs, keep this town humming along, diversify, growth, am I right? You're absolutely right, Mayor Betz. All the more reason to support. I wish we were in a better position to help out, Chloe. Yeah, but as you can see... I thought Army organized the toy drive. We are in need of additional funds this year. City coffers are dry. We barely have it in the budget for our regular Christmas events as it is. Your image as an elected official is directly tied to the image of Maple Grove, wouldn't you say? Yes, I would. Okay, well, this year, we're expanding the toy drive beyond military families. The families that live in the city where you're up for reelection. You make a good point. I'll see what I can spare. It won't be much. The amount doesn't really matter, does it? It's the spirit of giving what you can, am I right? We will take whatever you can give us. I'll be in touch. Sure would be nice if we got some Christmas snow this year. I mean, without any real help from the city, this might be tougher to pull off than we thought. Then we'll just do it the old-fashioned way, door to door if we have to. Yeah, you know what? You're right. There's a lot of generous people in this community who still wanna help. You know, I was thinking. "Toy Drive" is... is so generic, right? It's a good cause, people might donate. But if we want this to be something special, it has to inspire people. Yeah. No, no, I'm with you. Like, like a theme. Think about what we do in the military when we go into combat. We name them, right? Operation Enduring Freedom. Operation Toy Drive just doesn't have a ring to it. Operation Santa Claus. I love it. It's perfect. Thanks. I'm sorry. I, I'm working at the soup kitchen tonight. I knew it! I knew it! Funny. Tomorrow, then? First thing. Okay. Hi. You... do realize it's 0600. Seriously? Come on, reveille. You should be used to it. Besides, early bird gets the worm. Come on in. I'll be ready in a minute. - Thank you. - Yes, of course. Where did you find this place? Through a buddy. It's perfect, right? Yeah. Well, make yourself at home. I'll be quick. I... I... I love what you've done with it. I mean, it's only... it's only been a month since I... I'll get that. It's Christmas. You haven't had time yet to unpack either? Yeah, I'm... still trying to figure out the rest of my life, you know? You don't intend to stay? Well, I may just fix this place up and flip it. Yeah, it depends on reasons to stay, really. Shall we? Okay, so I was thinking. Every year, the toy drive is kind of a dull event, you know? The... the toys come in, they're passed out to kids who wait in line. There's no, like, celebration or anything. So, you think we should have, like, a Christmas party where we hand out the gifts? Exactly. We could have it on Christmas Eve. That way, people can still spend Christmas Day with their families. It'll cost more money. Well, after today, the donors will be lining up. You certainly are optimistic. It's the season of miracles. We should probably take your car. My... my heater's broken. Well, I just spent the last 10 years in Afghanistan. Looking forward to a little less heat. Look, I promise I'm gonna take it in as soon as I have some free time. Free time? Now, that would be a miracle. Heh. Randall Industries, President Thomas James. Just rings with generosity. Thanks. It's like they all have the same script. "I'm sorry, we've already donated to other causes." It's okay, all right? It's like the first thing that happens in every battle. You throw out the first strategy, come up with a new one. It's perfect. What's perfect? We don't need a new strategy. We need a new face. All you would have to do is sit by our side. It's gonna be a lot harder for people to say no, you know, if there's a child in the room. But I don't need another toy. The other kids do. Okay, think of it like acting in a commercial for a good cause so that those other kids do get a toy. Yeah, and some of those kids are your friends, so this is your way of helping them. And I really have to be at the winter clothing donation center in 30 minutes, so we need your help. You know what, guys? I'm all in. Perfect. You guys got this. So this store has been here a long time, Mrs. Gadbaw. You must be very proud of that. I am. A lot of loyal shoppers here in the community. Then why do you give less than 1% of your profits to the local charities? I don't think that's true. Well, I... I actually have it all... have it all right here. I can see the numbers. Maybe it's a typo. I don't... Well, it... it's a family business. Markets are down, expenses are up, and I'm afraid I'm just not in a position to contribute this year. Daddy? You promised! You said all the children will have a lovely Christmas this year. I'm... Just one minute, okay? Yeah. So, who can I make this out to? Did it work? Yes! But I'm not sure that was setting a very good example. Besides, that's how a lot of kids will feel if they have no presents to open, so, you know... Good point. I think I need an agent. I... I think you're on to something. In the meantime, we got our first donation! - Yes! - Woo-hoo! - That's you! - Yes! Good job! You guys did it! Operation Santa Claus. May the money keep pouring in. Here, here. One of the things I did when I was in Afghanistan is we asked the kids if there was something specific they wanted. And we found ways to track it down. It wasn't always easy. Yeah, but it made it personal for them. That's right, yeah. Well, I would like to do the same with our kids, not just some generic toy we didn't put any thought into, you know? Still a week left until Christmas. Plenty of time for them to write to Santa, addressed to Operation Santa Claus. I love that. You know, for such a big guy, you have a really soft heart. Don't tell my Army buddies. You miss them, huh? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I... I miss our camaraderie. I miss the accomplishments. So... thank you for giving me something meaningful to do, Chloe. - It's been a big help. - I'm glad. - Yoo-hoo! Hey! - I'm sorry we're late. My shop has never been busier. Well, it seems you two have been inseparable. Operation Santa Claus is keeping us very busy, Mom. Hot cider, anything...? - Yeah, that'd be great thanks. - Okay. Well? I think I told you, it's work. I'm serious. It's what I do. Yeah, hanging out together at social events? It's just helping him assimilate, that's all. Well... ... he seems very nice. You could do a lot worse. You two are hopeless. - General! - Hello, Chloe. I've spoken with my superiors to find some additional funds for Operation Santa Claus. No promises, but I'm working on it. Also, with the other business we discussed. Thank you, General. What other business? Well, you can't say anything, but we're trying to get Savannah's parents home for Christmas. That'd be terrific. Well, it's a longshot. General, this is my mother, Lynn. Mom, this is General O'Toole. It's a pleasure to meet you, General. Likewise. And you know my sister, Lieutenant Trish Barns. Yes, at least one member of the family is still in uniform. I knew your husband. He was a great man. Great soldier. Thank you, General O'Toole. Please, just call me Peter. - Peter O'Toole? - Yes. Found it rather fitting since I did three tours in the Middle East. Of course. That's lovely. Peter O'Toole, like "Lawrence of Arabia." Excuse me. Excuse me. Mom! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. He's my commanding officer. Jeez, Mom! What... what did I miss? Nothing. Nothing, it's okay. Well, I had a great time. Thanks for the invite. Hey, me too. I'm... I'm glad you wanted to come out with us. I know it's not always easy meeting new people. Yeah. Having a good counselor really helps. Thanks. You need a ride home? No, thanks. I'm meeting up with an old buddy of mine I haven't seen in a while, so... Okay. I will... I'll check in with you tomorrow, then. Okay. Hey! I was just thinking, if you'd like, I could take a look at your heater. You know... I'm feeling like it might be time to open up that toolbox again. Yeah. I mean, I guess that would be part of the whole process, right? Yeah, of course. I don't wanna trouble you, though. It's no trouble. My car can be... pretty stubborn. Yeah, well, so can I. Bring her by tomorrow, huh? Okay, then. I'll see you then. Looking forward. Hand me a 3/8 socket, please. - Here you go. - Thank you. Did you fix a lot of old cars in Afghanistan? Heh, you'd be surprised. Clamp? - Here you go. - Thank you. So I'm curious why you did toy drives over there. Well, grew up in foster care, house to house. Every Christmas, I sought out anyone who was sponsoring toy drives or any other charity. I had to fend for myself. Some years, it was the only gift I got. You were never adopted? - No. - I'm sorry. No, it's why I joined the Army when I did. So why did you leave? Well... I guess I got... dinged up a few too many times, you know? My best friend got reassigned and I just felt like I needed a new challenge, you know? Change. Get on with the rest of my life. Yeah. Yeah, it's... it's hard leaving friends. That was the most difficult part for me too. Some more than others. So this... this best friend is... more than just a friend? Yeah, you could say that. I loved her more than anyone else in this world. Heck, come to think of it, I've known her longer than anyone else in my life. Well, why can't you be with her? Like I said, you know, she was... reassigned. And when the Army makes the rules, they stick with it. My favorite Christmas song. I know, it's corny. No. No, it's... it's mine, too. When I was a kid, at church, we would all be singing it, hold candles. It's what Christmas is for me. So, where did you get such an interest in fixing things? Heh. One of the gifts I got when I was a kid was this... this chemistry set. I had no idea what to do with it. Hated chemistry. So, I told my foster parents. This... this really great guy, he taught me how chemistry's a part of everything around us, right? Electricity, nature, even inside of us, all interacting, all connected to one another. And I don't know. That's always fascinated me, how we're all, a part of something bigger than ourselves. But, all right. One last tighten here and the clamp is on. Why don't you give it a shot? Ladies and gentlemen, we have heat! Yeah, like I said. Chemistry. I thought your receptors weren't armed. They aren't. I'm just... I don't know, I'm just... I'm surprised, you know? He didn't exactly seem like a guy in love with another woman. - He's not. - He just told me he was. Maybe he was, but he's not now. Why do you say that? Because unlike you, I believe in romance. And... I don't know, I can see it happening with you two. It doesn't matter. I'm not even in that place anyways in my life, so... You think I was ready to get married when I met Dan? No. It... it just happened. And honestly, I couldn't be happier. Is he gonna be able to come home for Christmas? No. But it's fine. I get to see him right after New Year's, so... I love that you're so happy, Trish. I want that for you too. But if you don't leave yourself open to it, then... it's gonna jinx you when it finally does come around. Nah-ah-ah, no. I don't believe in jinxes. I don't believe in luck. I don't believe in... Romance. But... listen, Chloe, sometimes you gotta let your walls down and just... believe. Well? How do I look? Ridiculous? I think I look adorable. Let's go kick some butt. Welcome, everyone, to our 15th annual hot chocolate contest. I think we can agree that this year will be another close contest. Our reigning champion, Charlotte Bennett, has promised a new sprinkle, shall we say, to her consistently amazing creations. Our three judges will now take their places at the table. We all know Jake Dunlap, proprietor of Dunlap Landscaping. Marguerite Hennessey from By the Book Consulting. Unfortunately, this year Carol Sallee couldn't make it. Stepping in is someone many of you know and respect, General O'Toole. Hello, General. - You look... nice. - Thank you. Let the tasting begin! Here we go, folks! Well, some things never change. The two runners-up this year again are Phyllis Redding and Christi Johnson. In third place, congratulation to Rita Jones! Coming in first place... well, this is a surprise. We have a split decision this year. And the deciding vote was cast by General O'Toole. And the winner is... Lynn Marquee, owner and operator of Historic Perk. I can't believe it! Oh my god! It's the best hot chocolate in the state! - The best I've ever had. - I'm... I'm shocked. I... I was so rude to you the other day. Well, yes. But I wasn't gonna let that, keep me from being an honest judge. And... ...in fact, I think you have a nice laugh. Thank you! Finally, the gold! Mwah! I propose we all go to dinner and celebrate. All of us. How about we just make it the four of you? I have plans. You have plans? Yes, plans. Savannah, how about we go back to Auntie's, yeah? Yeah. Congrats, Mom. You deserve it. Shall we? Shall we? To Lynn! First prize, and well deserved. Darn right! Congratulations. - Thank you. - So happy for you. So General, how do you usually spend your Christmas? - I usually spend it alone. - Alone? Well, it's not as bad as it sounds. I'm surrounded by people every day of the week. Sometimes that's a nice time to be... alone. Well, you're not spending it alone again this year! Is that an invitation? Perhaps it is. All right, who is next? We need to keep the Christmas spirit going! Do you want some bread? - I'm okay. - Anyone? Chloe Marquee, is that you? It is! Chloe, how about another rendition of your favorite - Christmas song, huh? - No, no, no, no. That was one-time thing, no. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, don't be shy. You are fantastic. Come on up here! Hold on. Are you... are you a regular here? No. I was... volunteering for a fundraiser last week. And every time someone went up and sang, they doubled their donations, so... Why am I not surprised? She has a beautiful voice. Mom, please don't encourage him. Well, let's hear it. Not a chance. Oh, come on. You know, I've heard Michael sing when I toured his base in Afghanistan. He's very good as well. Let's hear it! Not a chance. - Come on! - Come on! - Get up there. - Let's go. - You! - Get up there, come on! Like, for real real, that was fantastic. - A little rusty. - Nonsense. Your voices are perfect together. In fact, I think the two of you would make a perfect... Mom! Chloe, I have an idea about this party. I think we should hire a Santa. Kids should receive their gifts from him. I'll secure a hangar on base. We'll have lots of decorations, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. We'll have Santa's chair, Christmas tree, the whole works. I... I think it's a great idea. I'm just not really sure we have the budget for that. Well, you keep rubbing the elbows and I'll do the same. This is too important. I want this to be the best Christmas party ever. Okay. I mean, I don't know how we're gonna pull this off, but... I say let's do it. As do I. All right! To Operation Santa Claus. To Operation Santa Claus. - Here, here. - Cheers! Yeah, come in! - Hey. - Hey! What are you doing? This house needs more help acclimating than I do. Here, take a look. That's fantastic! Savannah's corralling her friends to help put them up all over town and I'm gonna... Wait, what are those? Yeah, I found them in the attic. Well, now you've got no excuse, Mister. Thank you. That's... that's awesome. Let's decorate. Yay! It's so pretty. - Whoa. - Yeah? - Whoa! - Aah! Well? It is not a house anymore. It's a home. So do all returning vets get this much attention? Only the most serious cases. Well, guess you better stay on it a little while longer. Yeah. I think we're at the most critical juncture. Christmas snow would make this perfect. I'll put it on my list to Santa. All right. Here we go. Just the two I'm looking for. Congratulations again, Lynn. Poor Charlotte is still recovering. Well, I didn't mean to cause her any harm. Oh, nonsense. It was time for a new champion. Rightfully deserved. Darn tootin'. What can we do for you, Mayor? This whole Operation Santa Claus has really galvanized the town. And I'd like to parlay that into a new Christmas tradition: a town Christmas tree. We could have a donation box or a sign with instructions where people can give money to the toy drive. I'll host, of course. They don't call me the Jimmy Fallon of Maple Grove for nothing. That's a great idea. I mean... Yeah, no, I... I think it's a wonderful idea. But in order to light the Christmas tree, the town has to have one. Good point. Well outside our budget. I have an idea where we can find one. It won't cost us anything. I like the sound of that. Where? I'll show ya. Come on. Okay. So are we just supposed to drag one of these back by ourselves? I contacted a tree company who's donating their services. All right, well, this is the one I'm thinking. It's huge! Fun fact: few trees die from old age. They die from disease and, among other things, people. This one's dying from the stress of the wind that's coming in from the valley. So... if we can repot it, move it into town, it could be their Christmas tree for years to come. Trunk's a little crooked, but... No, it gives it character. It's perfect. No. We... we can't use it. - Why not? - See this? It's called a red sun bloom, and it's extremely rare. They sometimes grow in the winter if they have enough protection from the wind, and this tree's protecting it. So what you're saying is if... if we take this tree, it's gonna die? Yeah, most likely. The whole legend about this flower... they say it represents love and revival under the harshest of circumstances. I mean, it's a... it's a metaphor. Everyone's duty to protect the less fortunate. - You're kidding. - It's... it's ironic, isn't it? I mean, us helping others, us finding this flower? Yeah, it's like we were... like we were supposed to find it. It's proof that love can survive anything. Well, we're just gonna have to unfortunately find another tree. Got ya! You! I believed you! Aah! It's a good story, though, isn't it? I will seriously get you for this! I think it is hilarious. He's flirting. I told you, he's in love with someone else. - Excuse me, Chloe? - Yes, hi. My name is Tina. This is my daughter, Emmy. Hey. We just heard about Operation Santa Claus. I'm so glad. Things have been a little tough this year - and we wanted to thank you. - You're welcome. We also wanted to know if there was anything we could to do help. Yeah, we could use all the help we can get. How about helping us organize some of these new decorations? Take these ornaments and go put it in that bin right there. - Chloe? - Yeah? I got another case for you. He got back home in the last couple weeks. What about Michael Fischer? I know. Operation Santa Claus is the talk of the town. I've read your report and he seems more than capable of spearheading it from here on out. I think he's still hurting, Doug. Look, there's something I have not cracked about him and I really wanna see it through. I understand, but you don't have to spend every day with him. And you're gonna have to let go of some of this volunteer work, too. You're too important here. Listen, you understand this more than anybody how difficult it is for these soldiers transitioning back home for the first time. They need you. All right? I gotta get this. - Chloe? - Yes? Great work. Thanks. - Michael? - Hey, are we still on? I'm so sorry. I got swamped and... What's wrong? My boss reassigned me to a new case, says I'm spending too much time on Operation Santa Claus. Well, I thought that was your job, you know? Seeing me through this difficult time? Mission accomplished. At least, that's what he thinks, anyway. And you? I think you're doing great. And, you're gonna have to see it through on your own. I gotta get this, sorry. Miss Marquee? Chloe. Please. - Hi. - Hi. Have a seat. - Welcome home! - Thank you. - How are you doing? - I'm good. It's been a bit of a challenge so far, but, I'm good. Yeah, I, I went through the same thing a little over a year ago, so I understand. Yeah. Do you have family here? No, no, they're actually not here. They're in California. And it looks I'll be spending my holidays here. I'm sorry. That... that can definitely make the transition a little bit more difficult. Yeah, I guess that's why I'm here. Well, I mean, I feel good, excited. It's just that I feel like I could use a little bit more of a direction. Well, have you thought about maybe what kind of work you'd like to do? Well, one of the things I wanted to get into was volunteering. Something specifically for, like, underprivileged children? Like maybe a toy drive or something? I know it sounds silly, right? No, it doesn't. - Are you kidding? - No, no. Actually, that's always been a soft spot for me. But I don't suppose that's what you do here, though, is it? Because I feel like that's exactly what I need in order to get acclimated back into civilian life. What a coincidence. Santa is gonna give pictures of the kids. You! It's... it's... it's a small world. What can I say? Pat and I go way back. Wait, you guys were both in on this? I plead the Fifth. But I meant what I said. And I'd love to get involved with Operation Santa Claus. - Chloe. - Doug? - How's it going? - It couldn't be better. This is Lieutenant Harlan. I have found the perfect thing for him, and I will personally oversee his progress. Well, great. Lieutenant, you're in good hands. Thank you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Here, try the hot chocolate. Then tell my mom it's the best hot chocolate you've ever had. Thank you, but I'm... I'm sorry, I can't... It's... it's on the house. You're so kind. Is the North Pole okay? It'll find its way. Okay, great. Okay, let's get our hot chocolate. You really do spend half your day volunteering for one thing or another, don't you? According to my boss, most of the day, yeah. What about time for yourself? Family and friends? Relationship? I manage. Why so much? I mean, I... I... I think it's great, but... don't you worry about burnout? You asked what my purpose was when I came back. I was deployed to so many places around the world and... saw just how little they had. You know, I... I wanted to make a difference. Makes sense. It's funny, 'cause when I'd be home on leave, people would always thank me for my service. And I don't know, I just... I never thought of it that way, you know? The... the Army, this... this country has given me so much. I'm the one who feels thankful. Paying it forward. So to speak, yeah. What about... what about a family? Someday. When it's right. What about you? Someday. When it's right. Is that what she wants, too? Who? The... the woman that you're in love with. In... in love with? What's her name? Her name? You mean... That's... that's funny. Her name is... is Otter. - Otter? - Yeah. When she... when she sleeps on her back, her feet fold over like an otter. That's how she got her name. Otter. My Army dog. Army dog. Yes. So, you thought... No, no. No, no, no. The... the... the German shepherd that I saw in the photos, yeah. No, I... I... I was just teasing. I... can you excuse me? I... I have to... I have to go, so... You... I'll finish here. I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage, Chloe. That's well outside my protocol. Well, I understand, but I did a little research. And Otter's been in the service for 10 years. All 10 of those were with Captain Fischer. She's gotta be going through the same withdrawal as he is. A highly trained dog like Otter is a high commodity. If the Army saw fit to keep her in service, they're gonna stand firm on that. You're fond of him, aren't you? Michael. I just want him to have a good Christmas. He's earned that. And, yeah, I am. All right, I'll make the call. But I've already used a lot of capital on your other request. Is there any update on that? No, but I'm still trying. You haven't said anything to Savannah. No, I wouldn't wanna get her hopes up like that. Chloe, sometimes I worry you're getting your hopes up. Me too. Well, you know what, General? - We just need a miracle. - Or two. I think Santa is going to have a very busy night. Are you okay? It's from Amber Dunlap. She wants a Raggedy Panda. I don't know what a Raggedy Panda is. It's a stuffed animal. They all have funny faces and long hair, and they only eat vegetables. Do you have it on your list? Okay, well, then what's wrong? You look sad. I asked for a Raggedy Panda last year. My mom and dad told me they couldn't find it anywhere, which was okay. Every kid wanted one, so they were hard to get. But when I woke up Christmas morning, there it was under the tree! Your parents must've worked really hard for that. It wasn't them. It was Santa. It was the only thing on my list and Santa got it for me. He's clever that way, huh? I only have one thing on my list this year. Sweetie... I wrote a letter to Santa... the real Santa. I told him all about Operation Santa Claus and how we're helping him so that way, it'll be easy for him to deliver all the presents. And that way, he'll have enough time to bring my mommy and daddy home. I think that's a really tall order for Santa to fulfill that kind of wish, Sweetie. I thought so. Oh, honey, I know it's hard, okay? But think about this: you and I would have never become such good friends. And that is the greatest Christmas gift I could ever have. I'm glad we're friends, too. You have two very lucky parents. So he can be there by 5:00? Any time you like? - And he's good? - Yeah. He's the best Santa helper we've ever had. - Everyone just loves him. - Okay, great. I will send over all the details. And don't forget, I'm gonna send the names of the kids, the presents they asked for, and then a few photos so he can recognize a few of them by sight. - He'll be thrilled. - I'll look for your email. - Thank you so much. - All right, great, thank you. - Bye bye. - Hey, Chloe. What's the status on Lieutenant Harlan? I will have a report on your desk tomorrow. I gotta run. Sorry! We have less than 24 hours until the kids start lining up to see Santa and receive their presents. We're doing great. You're right. I mean... look at this place. It already looks incredible, so... It does. It really does. Hey, this is Chloe? Hi, this is Jena Walz. I'm afraid Santa's reindeer have come down with a wee bit of a cold and will not be able to get Santa to your Christmas Eve party tomorrow. I'm... I'm sorry, what? I know, he just called. So Santa's not coming. We apologize for any inconvenience. Any inconvenience? I... I... I'm sorry, I don't... I don't think you understand. We have to have Santa. I don't care if his reindeer are sick. Fly Santa here on a magic carpet. All our other Santas are booked right now. But I do have you on a waiting list. Christmas is tomorrow. These kids are gonna be devastated. I'm sorry. Merry Christmas. I'm... I'm sorry. Did that just happen? It did. But it's okay. We're gonna... let's just talk this out. Okay. New objective. Operation Find Santa. I like it. I'm gonna make some calls. Find Santa. Find Santa. Okay. Easy. Yes! - They're all here? - Every single of them. Santa didn't miss a thing. Looks good. Hey. - Anything? - No. I checked social media, called the agencies. I even tried finding a Santa suit that one of us could dress up in. Nothing. Well, we are running out of time. I don't know what to do. I... I don't know. We'll, we'll just have to explain that it's a busy time for Santa and that he can't make it in person. I mean, the kids will understand, I think. - Just won't be the same. - No, it won't. But all things considered, I mean... we've done a heck of a job, you know? This is gonna be the best Christmas these kids have ever had. - Trust me. - Yeah. Yeah, you know what? You're right. You're right. Your men did a good job. It looks beautiful. Come on! Okay. I have an idea. I'm guessing we overloaded the breakers. No biggie. But... it depends on whether we just tripped a circuit - or damaged that. - What if it's damaged? We won't be lucky enough to find enough generators to power this hangar. All right. The main breaker. All these tiny little atoms bouncing off of each other. Invisible to the naked eye, but powerful enough to turn the darkness..into light. - Okay. - That was it? Add it to the list of miracles, General. Well, huh! General O'Toole? Fantastic. You're gonna make a lot of people very happy. Hey, come on. I have a surprise for you. Look who made it. What? You're Chloe! And Michael. It's so good to meet you both. I don't... I don't understand. I was told there wasn't anyone available. Well, I have to say it wasn't exactly easy. But I'm glad to lend a helping hand. By the way, Operation Santa Claus? Brilliant! Do you mind if I use it next year? The reindeer are getting frustrated by the work load. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Yeah, it's... it's... it's all yours. Come on, I'll show you where to get started. Okay. There. All right, guys, come on down. And Santa's right there. All right. Merry Christmas. How you doin'? Great, great. Jason Fromm! You've been such a good boy this year. Merry Christmas, Jason. Now, I know you! Emmy! What do we have for you? Now let's not forget about your mother. I don't think we have a gift for their moms, Santa. I'm sure I saw one. Down there. Don't be shy! You do so very well by your daughter. She is lucky to have a mother like you. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Santa. You're welcome. I didn't think we got anything for the parents. Yeah, I didn't either. Amber? He is really good. Merry Christmas. How could he possibly remember so many names so quickly? Yeah... I don't know. I... yeah, there's a... there's a list or... - Santa? - Yes? - Did you get my letter? - Of course I did. I guess there was nothing you could do. It's been a very busy time of year, Savannah. I understand. Oh my goodness. Hey, is that really them? Yeah. Look over there. Oh, baby! Mommy! Daddy! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Welcome home, Mom. - Thank you. - You're welcome. How did you pull this off? Honestly? I have no idea. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Bye, Santa! You're welcome to stay. Thank you, Chloe. But I have quite a busy night ahead of me. You really saved the day. Oh, no, no. It is you who saved the day. You know, the work I do isn't limited to just the elves and gifts and sleigh ride every year. It's also about inspiring people like yourself. All your volunteer work, reuniting families, all the work you do is an extension of me. And I can't do that without people like you. How do you know so much about me? Chloe, it's there for all to see. Either way, that Christmas snow? Still working on it. Leaving already? Yeah. Funny guy. - That's strange. - What? It's from the agency. Found a Santa. Wondering if we still want to hire him. If he didn't come from the agency, then... where did he come from? Ho, ho, ho, ho! No! Couldn't be. You know, I... I was thinking about something. Neither one of us brought a date to this party. Well, there's a very simple reason for that. And that is...? Well, neither of us sought out someone else because we subconsciously hoped the other wouldn't either. The problem for both of us, however, is that by lowering our defenses, it can cause us to feel threatened and unsafe, which is why neither of us considered the alternative. Which is? I told you I'd get you back. What happened to disarming her neuroreceptors? Chemistry. Our work here is done. Are we... are we expecting anyone? Lieutenant Harlan is gonna join us... wasn't he? He said he had an assignment, thought he wouldn't make it. I wonder what kind of assignment that was. What? - What are you guys... - Hello? Otter! Hi! Good girl. Who's such a good girl? Yes, I missed you so much! Oh! Oh, my girl! You're a good girl. You guys all knew about this? Well, we didn't know for sure until this morning. It was all Chloe's doing. Such a good girl. Thank you. Welcome home, Soldier. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
