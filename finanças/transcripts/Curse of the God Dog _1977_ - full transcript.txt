A jeep! Hey, mister, where are you going in this funny car? It's a secret. We're looking for treasure. - Really? - No way! - What kind of treasure? - Uranium. - What's that? Hey, where are you guys? - What are you doing up there? - Shut up! Get outta here! Hey! What's up? What's going on? I'm sorry... Here's your... Taro. Wow, look at that! - The needle is jumping! - Bingo! Taro! - Count at 20,000. - Count at 24,000. It's over 30,000! It looks like we found a major vein. - It must be a whole mountain of uranium. - We did it! Let's check the readings a little further down the road. What the heck is this? - Let's go. - It's a small shrine... Don't sweat it - it's just a dog. - Right? - It's disgusting. - OK, let me drive. Taro! Taro! Taro! Taro! Six Months Later - Late Autumn Isamu! How could you do such a thing? How can I show my face at the reception now? He hates us anyway, so I don't see the point in going! What are you talking about? Who told you such a thing? Reiko and I are close friends. And I thought you were friends with Kenmochi's older sister. I hate her! Why did she have to marry such a louse? "A louse?"? Kano-san is a good man. So you're sweet on him, too! Stop that foolish talk. What did he do? He's the one who killed Taro! - We waited for you! - What happened? - We brought you some leftovers from the reception! - Shit! Your family is just as creepy as everyone says! Isamu, I'm sorry.... I understand now... But there's nothing you can do to bring Taro back. Kenmochi's big sister doesn't know anything about what happened... and she would probably be surprised to hear it. I'll go with you. But you have to apologize to the Kenmochis. OK, Isamu? - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you. - See ya later. Kaori didn't come. She couldn't show her face, after the way her little brother behaved. - Reiko, hop in. - Take care. - See you. - Take care. - Goodbye. Good Luck! Goodbye! Kaori! Dad! Stop the car. They came to see us off. Stop the car! Stop the car! - Reiko! - Kaori! - Reiko! - Kaori! - Kaori! - Reiko! - Kaori! Kaori! Ladies and gentlemen, as you already know, this is the gold of the atomic age. This magnificent discovery is not just a major accomplishment... for our company, but also a great leap for Japan. Mr. Kano is the man who made this all possible, and the father of his new wife, Reiko, is the owner of the land that the uranium is sitting on. He is kind enough to fully cooperate with our company at this time, and is allowing is to mine all of the uranium from his property. Next, I would like to introduce another important member of the team that discovered the uranium deposit, Mr. Nishioka, the man who introduced this lovely couple to one another. Kano-san, Reiko, I offer my congratulations. It was a magnificent day... We came upon a beautiful pixie in the woods, and then, and I'll never forget this, the Geiger counter went up to 10,000, then 20,000, then 30,000. We all shouted "banzai!" We immediately returned to the village at the foot of the mountain and telephoned the company. Wait... Something happened... It was before we got to the village... Nishioka, what's the matter? Nishioka? Nishioka! Reiko, what's the matter? Forget about what happened at the wedding reception. Reiko, I'm here. There's nothing to be afraid of. That idiot, Nishioka! You're driving like a maniac, you drunken fool! Cut me some slack - it was his wake tonight. He was a klutz. What a complete idiot! Yasui! Something happened at Kugamura. I can tell... What was it? I'm worried about you! Just because two people are dead.... There must have been something. Even if it seems trifling, tell me. - Nothing happened. - I don't believe you! It's nothing, really... but we ran over a small shrine with the jeep. And then.... After that, a small boy was walking his dog... It got in the way and we accidentally ran it over. That was the same boy that pelted me with a stone at the wedding. I had totally forgotten about it. It was Kaori's little brother. - It's just as I feared. - Reiko! It's the Dog God... THE CURSE OF THE DOG GOD! To Reiko Kano From Kaori Tarumi "Reiko, I'm sure you're very happy now... "Since you and Kano-san are married and settled, I feel comfortable telling you that I loved him too. "I might have tried to steal him, if he had been dating anyone except you. "I'm sorry, that was just a joke. "I'm to be married soon as well. "I know I will never find the happiness that you have, "but I'll try to be happy somehow." I'll never let the Dog God get you... If the Dog God has to have someone, let it be me! Darling! This charm has been in my family for generations. I know it will protect you from bad fortune. You don't have to worry now. Kaori, the Dog God is working through you. People have died from this curse! But you can't hurt Ryuji... I'm begging you! I don't care how badly you wanted him... I'll never, ever let you have him! Darling, I'm going to have a baby... I'm going to knit him a beautiful blanket. Reiko... Look, it's finished. Reiko... Reiko! Reiko is possessed by the Dog God. This isn't something a doctor can diagnose and cure. Mom, curses by foxes or the Dog God are just superstitious nonsense. The doctor says her symptoms indicate a mild hysteria. But the power of medical science can cure her... Just wait and see. Doctor! Please wait... You have to tell me. Is my wife sick? Can you help her? What's her prognosis? She seems to be getting worse. Darling! Reiko! I can't take it anymore! Get me out of here! I want out! Bus For Kami Kuga Reiko... I don't want you to make her stay in the storehouse! - I demand to know where you came from. - From Fukatani. Where in Fukatani? The Tarumi house... The Tarumi clan. - Why have you cursed this young girl? - Because of hate. What caused this hate? Your husband destroyed the small shrine. - That's all? - He killed a dog. - So you unleashed the curse? - I did. Balderdash! You have no business here! I'll give you food... Get out! Get out! I want rice and red beans... I will leave if you give me rice and red beans! Those sons of bitches! The curse seems to have been lifted. We couldn't have done it without you. It seems awfully quiet tonight... This should be the last snow before the spring. You think you can get rid of me so easily? I envy you... I wanted your husband. You're pure, I'm defiled... Who decided it should be that way? I thought you were my best friend... But in your heart you thought I was the Dog God! The agony! The agony! You think I can forgive this!? Dammit! This is an outrage! I've finally made you mine. He's all mine now! I cast you out! Get out of her! Get out of her! Reiko! Reiko! Darling... I want to go back to Tokyo... To your home. Reiko, it's me... I'm here! I'll take you back to Tokyo! Let's go back to Tokyo! Reiko! Young girl, you cannot be a bride... if you cry. Your beautiful red kimono... covered with a white veil... With a white veil. Boo-hoo, what makes you so sad? Rain falls on a flower bud... Stop it! Shit! Stop it! Stop! What are you doing, you idiot?! Wait.... Kaori! You're from the mining company... No matter how many times you come, my answer isn't going to change. You're not going to touch my mountain! That's not why I'm here... I wanted to finally meet you. My wife died from the curse of the Dog God. Why do you invoke the Dog God on people you don't even know? Why do you cast curses on innocent people? So you're Reiko's husband? Even a city slicker like you believes in the Dog God? I guess that, given the way your wife died, you didn't have much choice but to believe. No matter what I believe, my wife is dead. She was a fine lass... My Kaori knew her well. But my daughter's also the victim here... After the fuss about the curse, her husband's family kicked her out, and she had to come back here. Darling.... Why don't you clean up this pigsty?! Reiko's dead and gone now! Damn you, Dog God! Ryuji. Come in. The Tarumis aren't bad people. I hope you don't think they are. They wouldn't put a curse on her to kill her. Look, Isamu's my friend, and Reiko has always been kind to our family. Don't stand in the doorway, come in. Isamu's dad said you can't have the shiny rocks, didn't he? That's because he knows that they can be used to make atomic bombs. If that's all it's good for, it's better to let it lie in the ground. You may be right. Goodnight. On a moonlit night, the mole silently digs his grave. Raven 'caw, caw', burn the mountain down. The weather will be fair tomorrow... You can see how the uranium glows when exposed to ultraviolet light. Mr. Kenmochi, I can see why you're so interested in the stuff. I don't love it because it's beautiful, I love it because it has the potential to be an important energy source for the nation. It will be a great source of wealth for Kugamura as well... I hope that as the village Mayor you understand that administrative intervention... may be necessary to deal with the opposition from the Tarumi household. OK, I understand already. The men of the village won't have to leave... for the city after the harvest to look for work, all thanks to the mining company. Quick, over here! Over here! The method is simple... We pour sulfuric acid down the hole and collect the liquid as it pours through. Then we collect the uranium from the runoff liquid. This method isn't labor intensive and can be used to access areas of the mine that are difficult to get to. I believe it's ideally suited for the upcoming project. The one snag is that the sulfuric acid could seep into the village's water supply. Naah, looking at the geography of the land, I don't see any way that could happen. - Certainly, sir. - Well, then. It's settled. Go ahead! - It worked! - It worked! OK, everyone. Cheers! Cheers! Be silent, be silent. Be silent, be silent. Spirit of the mountain, spirit of the valley... Spirits of the gods, be silent. Mr. Kenmochi! What!? My son-in-law has been bewitched by that woman cast off by her husband! Hey, everybody, come over here! - Are you feeling better? - I'm OK. Close it off! Close it off! Close if off! Close off the Dog God! Close it off! Close off the Dog God! Ryusaku Tarumi God, it smells! There's an old legend that you can get rid of a curse by casting human feces at it. I guess they believe it. Don't go! Who knows what they'll do to you? She's right: the festival is tonight... and they're all mad with drink. Best not to go out tonight. Cast off evil spirits, close them off... Kaori... Kaori! Thank you. I've... always loved you. I've always loved you... Loved you. So, you can't forget Reiko after all. No, it's not that... If Reiko knew that you and I would end up... Goodbye. REIKO! This is terrible! The well's been poisoned! Doctor, this way! Over here! Hurry! Grandma and Grandpa died at the same time. I heard tell that the wells have all been poisoned. People are dying right and left. The water in the wells? Did you spend the night at the Tarumi's? Yes. There was no way of coming home last night. I'm sorry to have been away when things were so difficult for you. They're out for blood for what you did. You best watch yourself. Where's Kaori? What's wrong? Sir, the solvent got into.... What?! But that's... That's not possible! It must have somehow connected with the groundwater. We have to stop production at once! You mustn't breathe a word of this to anyone... - Not a word. - Sir! Mako, what's the matter? What is it? What happened? Isamu and his family are in trouble... Those men with the bikes broke in, carrying weapons! What is it? The villagers are convinced that the Tarumis have poisoned the wells. We have to do something to stop them. I'll tell them the truth... They'll stop once they hear the truth! Mako, let's go! Wait, you can't go! Sir, let me go, this is a matter of life and death! Forget about it! The well water wasn't our fault... It's just like the villagers said: somebody poisoned the wells! Mako, let's go! - This way is faster! - OK! - Mining equipment removal finished! - Right! - Next, we disassemble principal buildings! - Understood! Mako! On all of the days, where could that child have gone? Mako! Mako! Now I will become the Dog God... and dispel this curse once and for all. Curse of the Dog God come unto me... Come unto me and curse this village. Curse this village, down to the last generation! Mako! - She's gonna give! - Let's get outta here! It's gonna collapse! Get out! What do you want? Wipe that smug look off your face... You killed a mother and her children. What the hell is he talking about? Do you know? I'm not playing games! The father of the family you killed cursed you, your gang, and the entire village before he died. You're talking like a fool. We're outta here. Not so fast! This sword belonged to the father. You're going to turn yourselves in... whether you like it or not. I thought you went to the site of the accident on the mountain? I'll explain it to you later. This man was a party to murder... Let him stay here for a while - the police box isn't safe. Officer, hurry up and call police headquarters! Now! Hello... The line's down. - Father! Even you.... - You're in over your head, boy. - What about the poison in the well!? - Silence! I know all about it... There was no other way I could have stopped the villagers' anger with the Dog God. - That was the reason!? - I did it for you! Everything's backward! I'm quitting my job! I'll expose everything! Mother, hide for now. Gimme the keys to the storehouse! No, Ryuji! Anyplace but the storehouse! Just wait a second.. You're not handing my son over to the police. Of course not. I was just discussing the matter with my son-in-law. Get in! Ryuichi, the truth is... Stop, stay outta that storehouse! Ryuichi, stay back! Mother! Let her go! Let her go! Shinichi! Sawa! Sawa! - Watch out! - Don't shoot! Father! Father! Father! The truth is he's our eldest son... It was the Dog God that made him crazy in the head. They cursed us when I took this land, which had been collateral for a loan. His mother grieved and died to raise him. The Dog God was the cause of all of our misery. We couldn't let people know that we had such a wretched son. I wanted to protect him. Then Sawa came... She had Reiko, then Mako... I couldn't let her know of Shinichi. Can you understand? Reiko died such a horrible death... All because of the Dog God! And, in the end, the Dog God even took my only son in revenge. Ryuichi... Mako... Please take care of Mako. Reiko! Mako! You have robbed this village of everything it has! Take it all! You're cursed! Leave this place! Get out of here now! Who are you?! You've possessed Mako! Who are you! Darling, I'm in pain! You must've been the one who betrayed us. Now you love Kaori! - How odious! How hateful! - Reiko! I loved you until it drove me insane. It's maddening! I can't find peace in the next life. You took everything from this family... You took everything. You cursed man! Go away before I kill you! It was my fault... But I won't go. Mako is still here. Mako isn't a monster like you! I'll never leave this house, until you bring Mako back! Then I'll enjoy watching you suffer before you die! Die, cursed man! Mako! Mako! Where is she!? Mako, hang on for a little bit longer! Mako? Mako! Don't die! Mako! You're going to leave me, too! Reiko... It's not just you... I'm responsible for Mako's death, too. Mako... please forgive me.
