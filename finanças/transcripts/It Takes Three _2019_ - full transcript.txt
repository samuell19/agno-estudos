(cheery music) - [Gus] I know you're here somewhere. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Here, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit. Mr. Rabbit. (sniffing) Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit. Don't you wanna play? Ha ha, gotcha. Hey, which way you going? Don't run, come back here. Gosh, that rabbit's fast. - Psst, Gus. - Huh? How'd you know my name, Mr. Rabbit? - Gus, it's me, Buddy. - Hey, my best friend's name is Buddy, too. You wanna come meet him? - Gus, I'm right here. Wake up. - What? Oh, whoa, oh, oh. Hey, Buddy, how's it going? I must've been having one vivid dream, let me tell ya. - Tell me later. We have a big problem. - What kind of big problem, Buddy? Did you run out of salmon kibble again? - Mmm. Salmon kibble's my favorite. Please tell me you didn't eat it all, Buddy. Say there's some left. - There's a whole bag left, Gus. - Phew. - Phew. - But I don't know who's gonna buy the next bag whenever it does run out. - Maybe your dad's having troubles, but my mom's got plenty of money, you mutt. She buys me anything my little heart desires. - Yeah, Bella, we know. What's going on, Buddy? What's the problem? - I'd rather show you. Then you both can hear it for yourselves. Follow me. - Um, okay. - This better be good, Buddy. I take my beauty sleep seriously. (door creaks) - Hey, dad! - Shh! Keep your voice down, Gus. - But it's just that-- - Hush, listen. - This better be good, Buddy? - [Bob] Are you listening to yourself? This is crazy, Linda. Will you just let me talk? We don't need time away from each other. In fact, just the opposite. Why don't we book a vacation? - [Linda] I don't have time for a vacation, Bob. I'm already up to my eyeballs in work. Honestly, I can't deal with any of this right now. - Sounds like mom and dad are arguing, guys. - Impossible, mom and dad never argue. - [Bob] It'll be good for us. - [Linda] I just need some time to clear my head, decide what it is I wanna do, Bob. - I told you guys, this is serious. - [Bob] What do you want to do? You mean with us? - [Linda] Yes, with us. - [Bob] Linda, are you saying-- - [Linda] That's just it. I'm not saying anything, Bob. - [Bob] But you just up and left the house and all of us. You said yourself, the dogs are like your children. - [Linda] And they are. - Huh, see? My mom cares about her family. - Then why isn't she here right now? - [Bob] Well then why aren't you here right now? - [Linda] I need to sort some things out is all. - [Bob] Well then sort them out with me. Okay, I love you. Don't shut me out, please. Besides, where will you stay? - [Linda] I'm staying at my mom's, Bob. - [Bob] Your mom's? Linda, that sounds like you decided to leave your family. (Bella gasps) - Whoa, this is serious. - She'd never! - She did. - You didn't let me finish. I was trying to say she'd never leave me behind with you two mutts. - [Linda] I have to go now. - [Bob] Linda? - [Linda] Mom made us reservations at Tratiago's. I'll talk to you tomorrow. (phone beeps) - [Bob] But Linda! Linda? (Bob sighs) - He's leaving. - Quick, to the window! - Shh, here he comes. Try to act casual. Well, there he goes. He sure looks upset. I've heard of this kinda thing happening before. A marriage falls apart and the dogs are the ones who are the casualties. They just, they just end up reminding one parent of the other parent. Then, then off to the shelter they go. (Bella and Gus gasp) - [Gus] I don't know. - I thought you said we have plenty of kibble left, Buddy. - I thought there was another bag in the pantry. Huh, I guess I was wrong. - You picked a fine time to be forgetful. - Hey, cut me some slack, will ya, Bella? I'm as shook up as you are. - Shook up? (chuckles) Let's get one thing straight, Buddy. I'm not shook up. My mom's gonna come marching through that front door any minute, scoop me right up, and vroom, off we'll go. - You sure about that? - Sure? I'm positive. She said so herself. I'm her little sparkle fur princess, a number one. You don't just leave a sparkle fur princess behind because you move in with your mom. - Maybe you're right. - I'm always right, you oughta know that by now. - But Bella, what if we're all part of the reason mom's unhappy? (Bella gasps) - Hush your wagging tongue, mutt. Maybe you two noise complaints are a problem, but me? I'm a lapdog, you know? - I know, I know. And she had you before she had us, but dad had us before he had you, and I know he wouldn't abandon us, any of us, no matter what. It's just not like him. - It's not like him to storm out of here in a huff either, but he just did. - Yeah, he did. - Gus looks pretty sad over there. He won't leave the window. Think he's gonna be okay? - He'll come around. He's a strong dog. We were both strays when dad found us, you know. - Yeah, I know, and just to remind you, I was a top dollar show dog. - Yup, you remind us every day. Come on, let's go get Gus and try to take his mind off this malarkey. - You know, I think there are some cans of soft food in the high cabinets. - [Buddy] Really? How will we ever get up there to find out? - [Bella] Beats me, daddy's boy. You're the smartypants, you figure it out. - Maybe I will. Maybe I'll figure lots of things out. All right, I'm calling an emergency canine meeting. Time to figure out what to do next. All in attendance? - Aye. - Aye. I can't believe this is happening, guys. I've heard about dogs being raised in broken homes, but after dad saved us from the streets and met mom and Bella, I thought our hard knocks were behind us. Little did I know. - To be fair, Gus, you two have always had a stray dog vibe about you. - [Gus] What? No, we haven't. - Oh yeah, Aunt Bertha used to be terrified when you guys would run up to her in the backyard looking for treats. She thought you were rabid strays every single time. - Aunt Bertha has really bad eyesight. - [Gus] And she had a screw loose. - She had enough presence of mind to be frightened of wild animals charging at her from the fence line. - Look, we didn't charge her, okay? We did jump on her, sure. We did knock on her behind a couple of times, all right. But we were obviously two friendly, playful house pets. - [Gus] And like you said, she has really bad eyesight. - Like a bat. - [Gus] And a little kooky. - As a stack of chocolate chip cookies. - Well, that's not what she thought. She thought you two were rabid mutts escaped from the pound. - Well, we are not. Let's change the subject, shall we? - [Gus] I'd love to. I'd love to open my eyes again and find out this is the dream I thought I was having earlier. - You mean nightmare? - [Gus] Eh, yeah. Oh you guys, our family's disintegrating before our very eyes. What're we gonna do? - At least I'm so beautiful and perfectly proportioned I can find a home with any topmost breeder of canine show dogs in the world if need be. You two are clearly mutts and not very well groomed at that. - [Gus] Hey, that's not fair. You force mom to take you to the groomers and doggy spa every Monday. - Muh, I most certainly do not. She only takes me because she recognized the inherent beauty of my pedigree. - Listen up, guys, I have an idea. We're not gonna take this lying down. We're not just gonna watch our family crumble around us. Not without doing something about it. - [Gus] I like it, but what could we do, Buddy? - Apparently, he thinks he can bring mom and dad back together by shining the floors up real nice. - [Gus] Mm, that'll make mom happy, I'm sure. And dad won't have to use the duster mop nearly as much. That's a good plan. - No you guys, hear me out. We're not just gonna watch our life end up at the pound without taking action. We're good dogs, and we're gonna do what any good dog would do when its people are in trouble. - [Gus] We're gonna bark real loud? All right, I can do that. - So, it's a day like any other is what you're saying? - No, no, no, listen, you two. Mom told dad she was at her mom's house. - My grandmother lives clear across the country in New York. - That's right, Bella. And we're gonna go to New York and bring mom back where she belongs. - That's it? That's our plan? We're just gonna go to New York and find her? - Yes. - But this is California. New York's 3,000 miles away. How do you propose we get there? - We walk. - Walk? We're dogs, not wolves, you silly. - [Buddy] Our ancestors were wolves. The wolf spirit is still in us. We walk. - Right. - Not sure this is such a good idea, guys. - Bella, I was hoping we could all stick together. We need you on board, Bella. You're an essential part of this plan. - Well, I'm flattered, but-- - [Buddy] You have great intuition. - [Gus] I have a keen sense of smell. - [Buddy] And I'm a born leader. - [Gus] The three of us can do it. - New York, here we come. - Marvelous. - Okay, here we go, New York. New York. - Spelling. - Huh? - You spelled it wrong. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. New is N-U, everybody knows that. - Should Gus even be going to New York if he can't spell it? Maybe the two of us will go and he can keep the home fire burning here. - Fire? No way, dad said no open flames in the house, ever. - New York, here we go. - Oh, there it is. Look, they spelled it wrong, too. Heh heh, some search engine Floogle is. I don't know if we can trust these directions, Buddy. - Well, what do you say we look them up anyway? It can't hurt. - Unless it leads us into a swamp, or off the side of a cliff. Ugh, why don't we just follow mom's scent to New York? We're dogs after all. We have senses other animals can only dream of. We'll track her down the old fashioned way. - You know how many bodies of water lie between us and New York? We'll lose her scent over water. Besides, she's only been gone a couple of days, which means she hopped a flight. And we can't track a scent if our subject never touched the ground. - Okay, okay, ick. Print the directions. - Let's see here. There's a whole bunch of different routes to get to New York. - The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. - Right. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. We're at the mercy of the roads. If they twist, we gotta twist. If they wind, we wind. I know who could help us, Snaggles. - Snaggles? He's always online at his house. Let's get him on video chat. - Hey guys, what's shaking? - Hi, Snaggles. - Hi, Snaggles. We're planning a little trip. What can you tell us about New York? - New York? That's not a little trip. That's an epic journey. Are your mom and dad taking you three on vacation? - We wish. - Mom left dad, but we're gonna go drag her back home. (Snaggles gasps) - No way! - He's being dramatic, Snaggles. She just went to her mom's house to rest for a while and-- - Oh, she move in with her mom? Not a good sign, guys. - See? - Oh pfft, whatever. I know my mom, and she'd never leave her sparkle fur princess behind. - Her what? - We're trying to find the best driving route to New York, Snaggles. Any tips? - For a cross-country road trip, get your kicks on Road 66. - Hey, that rhymes. We lost him. This new high speed Internet's not all it's cracked up to be. - Snaggles? Snaggles? Are you still there? - No, but I am. - Jean Clawed! - Jean Clawed! - Oh great, don't you have anything better to do, Jean Clawed, than hacking into other animals's computers? - No, I'm a house cat, you glorified mop. We've got to get our kicks in where we can. - I hear Route 66 is good. - Yeah, so why don't you scram? - Why don't you scram, leg hiker? I've been monitoring your feed and I know exactly what you dogs are up to. And if you think you can get away with your little plan, you've got another thing coming. I'm going to make sure you have a very unpleasant trip. - Why do you care so much, Jean Clawed? Is it because we have each other and you're lonely? - We've invited you over to play lots of times. - Play? I don't play with your kind, mutts. But I do toy with your emotions. And now that your family is disintegrating around you, your whole perfect facade will come crashing down. (cackles) And I'll be there to use the pieces as my kitty litter. Enjoy the road, mutts, if you can. (cackles) - That Jean Clawed's such a jerk. - This only means one thing, guys. - Dogs are better than cats? - Well, yeah. But it also means we can't let Jean Clawed get the jump on us. We gotta leave sooner than we planned. We gotta leave tonight. Psst, Bella, Bella! - Hmm? What did I tell you about my beauty sleep, Buddy? - I know, I know, but remember our plans? It's time. - Aw, I need to comb my coat. I can't be seen like this. - Okay, but hurry up. I'll wake Gus. - Mr. Rabbit. - [Buddy] Rise and shine, sleepy head. - Huh? (grumbles) What's going on? - Remember our trip? It's time. - Oh. That wasn't a dream? - No, Gus, it wasn't a dream. We gotta go, and we gotta go now. - Okay, okay. Oh boy, I was really hoping I'd wake up and mom will be home. - We all were, Gus, but she's not. And this is the situation we're in. We can either ignore it and hope for the best or we can take charge of our own destinies and do something about it. I know which path I'm taking. - Going back to sleep and mulling it over in the morning? - No, I'm hitting the road, and you're coming with me. - Oh, right. Can I do my stretches? - Make it quick. Bella's combing her coat and then we're getting out of here. I want us to be far away by the time Jean Clawed wakes up. Better to have him chasing after us than in our way the whole time. - I agree, but Buddy, I love our life here. What if this is the last time we see our home? - It's up to us to make sure we all make it back, Gus, mom included. Come on, the sun will be up before we know it. - [Gus] This is depressing. I never thought I'd be back out here. The streets never change. - [Bella] I feel gross. I need a bath. - Calm down, both of you. Remember, we're not strays. We have a home, and we're not gonna lose it. That's why we're doing this. Keep your eyes on the prize. - There's a prize? - So to speak, Gus. The prizes are mom and dad together again. And that's what'll happen. - [Gus] Hmm. - Well, this is it. Once we step off that curb, this journey begins. (Gus inhales deeply) - [Gus] I'm ready. - [Bella] Okay, okay, let's get it over with. - That's the spirit. Here we go.

I'm gonna need a top notch manicure and pedicure after this. Does anyone have any idea how long we've been walking? - [Gus] Feels like forever. I wonder how much longer it is till New York. - [Buddy] Well, judging by the desert around us, we still have a ways to go. New York doesn't have sand and cacti. - [Gus] I could stand to find some water right about now, I'll tell you that. I'm parched. (hissing) - What? - What do you mean what? - [Bella] You just tried to get my attention. - [Buddy] No, I didn't, I'm just walking. (hissing) - [Bella] There it is again. Gus, was that you? - Wasn't me. - Did you guys hear that? Who's making that noise? - [Buddy] I heard it that time. Sounded like it came from over there. (rattling) - [Bella] Here, it must be coming from in there. Hello? - [Female Voice] Hello, pooches. - Whoa, who said that? - [Female Voice] I did. - Who are you? Are you stuck down there? - You need our help? - [Female Voice] Ha, no, but it looks like you could use my help. - I don't know how you could help us, miss. We're not trapped in a hole in the ground. Hang on, I'll come getcha. - [Female Voice] Oh yes. Please do. - Don't, Gus. - What do you mean don't? She could suffocate down there, or bake to a crisp. - She won't. This is a rattlesnake hole. - A what? Hee hee, yikes. - [Rattlesnake] That's right, poochie. I'm a rattlesnake. And you're in my desert. - Run, these things move quick. - [Rattlesnake] S-s-settle down, quadruped. If I wanted to eat you, you'd already be digesting. But I've already had my meal for the day. - I think I'm gonna be sick. How many rattlers do you think are out here? - Yikes, ooh, we could be surrounded. - [Rattlesnake] Indeed, but I'm the biggest and baddest rattler around here. The others may mess with you, but I'll do worse. - We didn't mean to trespass on your turf, miss. - [Miss Snake] Call me Miss Snake. - Okay, Miss Snake. We're not looking for trouble. We're just passing through. - On our way to New York. - New York. - Yeah? Do you know it? - [Miss Snake] I escaped from New York years ago. Why would you three pooches want to go to New York? - We're going to find our mom. - And bring her back home to California. - With us, where she belongs. - [Miss Snake] Why, you little fools. How do you expect to make it to New York on foot? It's going to take you forever. You'll be coyote food long before you even see the city skyline. - Coyotes? Ugh, there are coyotes out here, too? - [Miss Snake] There are dangers you'll never see coming, poochie. (Gus whimpering) - I knew this was a bad idea. - We don't mean to intrude anymore than we already have, Snake, but we need help. We're in over our heads. - Now he tells us? - What can we do to make it out of this desert in one piece? Or three pieces, and get to New York? - [Miss Snake] Well, there's only one thing you can do, and approaching snake holes isn't it. - Ugh, that's obvious. - Sorry, guys. - Tell us, Snake. Any help would be greatly appreciated. - [Miss Snake] If I were you, I'd hot wire a vehicle and drive out of here. - Hot wire a vehicle? And who would drive it? We're dogs, we can't drive. - Buddy can. - He can? - Yes, I can. - We got picked up one time when we were strays. And Buddy waited till the officer stopped for gas. Then we stole the animal control truck and we got away. - You've gotta be kidding me. - Nope, he used the turn signals and everything. - Well, how do you propose we get a car around here? - Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere. - [Miss Snake] Yes, you are. And some people like the middle of nowhere. And those people need cars to get there. Bear right and you'll get a nice surprise beyond that dune. - Okay, thanks, Miss Snake. - [Miss Snake] Don't thank me, poochie. Thank your lucky stars I've already eaten. Otherwise, your story would have a very different ending. (Gus gulping) - We'll, uh, just be going now, heh heh. Thanks for the advice. - Yup, here we go. - Bye, Snake. (Miss Snake chuckling) (playful music) There it is. - Wow. That thing's huge. What is it? - [Bella] It's called an RV, Gus. It stands for recreational vehicle. - [Gus] Cool, you sure you can drive that thing, Buddy? - [Buddy] I drove the animal control truck. How different can it be? That's it, Gus. That's the battery, ignition, and starter wire bundle. Now just twist those two wires together. - Which two? These two? - No, those two. The battery wires. Then connect the ignition wire to them. - This one? - No, that one. That one there. - Hurry up, you guys. I think somebody's coming. - Is it the coyote? - No, it's a human, and he looks peeved. - [Buddy] Quick, Gus. You gotta spark the starter wire before this thing will move. - This one? - No, that one! - Okay, okay! - He's definitely heading our way, and he's not happy. - Hurry, Gus. - He's almost here, guys! - [Gus] Got it! (engine sputtering) - Uh-oh. - Whoa, hang on, everybody. - [Human Man] Hey, what're you dogs doing to my truck? Get back here, doggone it! - [Gus] Is this okay, Buddy? We're not going over the speed limit, are we? - [Buddy] So far so good, Gus. Just hold steady and I'll let you know when we need to brake. And remember, don't slam it down. Go nice and easy. - [Gus] 10-4, good Buddy. - Hey Bella, is that a cellphone I see? - It sure is. - Hey, do either of you know mom's phone number? What about dad's? - I can't believe this. What good's a phone if we can't even call mom or dad? The only number I know by heart is Snaggles. - Maybe he has mom's or dad's number. - It's worth a shot. Let's call him, Bella. - Okay, here goes. (phone ringing) - I swear, if you telemarketers don't stop calling me. Bella! I didn't recognize this number. Did you get a new phone? - Something like that. - I heard on my CB radio that you guys are in some serious trouble. Is everyone okay? - What did you hear, Snaggles? Who said we're in trouble? - Oh, just every cop and federal agent from sea to shining sea. Reports are flying fast and furious that you guys stole a town mayor's RV. - That was the mayor? - Yup, he was on a bird watching trip in the desert when his RV was stolen by a trio of rabid mutts. - Mutts? Why, I-- - Aye, ugh. We're in so much trouble. - Mutts? They called me a mutt? - Guys, you don't think they'll lock us up in the pound, do you, Buddy? Gee, what if we get put down? - [Buddy] No one's gonna lock us up in the pound, Gus. - They will if they think we're rabid. And only stark raving rabid dogs would steal a mayor's car. - Get ahold of yourself, Gus. One look at my bright teeth and lustrous fur will tell anyone I'm not rabid. - What about me and Buddy? - Well, a bath might help. - Buddy, quick, find a lake. A pond, a puddle, anything. - Snaggles, you wouldn't happen to have either of our parents' cell phone numbers, would you? - Your parents? Gee, I don't think so. Lemme check, though, hang on. - Well, well, well, mutts. Now you've gone and done it. Fugitives from justice. Strays on the lamb. Common criminals fleeing the long arm of the law. That story only ends one way, canines. With you in a kennel cage. Or worse. - Jean Clawed! How in the world did you get this number? This is a stolen phone. - Shhh, don't admit to crimes, Buddy. You'll only seal our fate. - Too late. Your fates are already sealed, mutts. And I'll have you know, I've done my civic duty as a fine, upstanding feline, and provided local and federal authorities with your current GPS coordinates. They should be closing in on you in-- - Hang up, Bella, hang up! - Disconnect, disconnect! - [Bella] Oops, ohh, you're breaking up, Jean Clawed. We can't hear a thing you're saying. Oh, bye. - [Gus] We're being tracked. Throw that phone out the window. Throw it out! - [Police officer] Our satellites have located the RV, sergeant. It's traveling southwest along Armadillo Road. If the thieves hold their current course, it'll only lead them further into the desert. They just passed the last fuel station for 100 miles. - Hello, heroes of law enforcement. I'm a concerned citizen with some invaluable information regarding those thieves on the run. - [Cop] Yes, what is your information, sir? - If you really want to capture those fiendish menaces to society and capture them quick, it's really quite simple. A bowl of ground beef, a gallon of whole milk, and a stick will do the trick. - A stick? - A stick. Any old stick will do. Oak, pine, elm, fir, even an old broomstick. All you need is a good throwing arm, and a big net. (cackles) - [Cop] Thank you for the information, whoever you are. Rest assured our best officer is on the case. - Maybe we should give Snaggles another call. What do you think? - I want to, but I'm afraid to use the cell phone since Jean Clawed hacked our signal. - I still think it's a bad idea to keep that device around, you guys. If that crazy cat can triangulate our location, the cops can for sure. - Listen to us. It's not like we're a gang of bandits looking to rob unsuspecting motorists. I've never broken a rule in my life, I'll have you know. - Well, there's no time like the present to start. - Yeah, welcome to the mean streets, Bella. - Ugh, if any of this lunacy serves to take my stellar reputation, you two will never hear the end of it. - Stellar reputation? What stellar reputation? The whole neighborhood things you're spoiled and aloof. - Like I said, my stellar reputation. - Listen, we've come this far and neither Jean Clawed nor the police have caught us. I say we keep going, lay low, and go visit our old pal in Salt Lake City. - You mean-- - Oh no, not that obnoxious bird. Percy. - Percy! - The one and only. - Uh-uh, no way. I veto that idea, veto, veto, veto! - Why? - Are you still mad about that time she nicked your ear when we were playing? - Nicked? She almost tore it clean off. Mom had to bandage my whole head for a month. - Heh heh heh, I know, you looked like a mummy. - Good thing it was Halloween. You didn't even have to buy a costume that year. - Are you guys listening? If my fur weren't so lustrous, you'd still see the scars. That savage bird of prey viciously attacked me. I don't feel safe around her. - Bird of prey? Percy's a parakeet. - Sometimes in life, Bella, we have to step outside our safe spaces to get things done. - Like now. She's so sorry for what happened, anyways. She asks how you're doing all the time. - You still talk to that monster? - I follow her tweets. - I'm telling you guys, I will not let that vulture anywhere near me. If you go to her house, I'm staying in the car. - Okay. - And you're leaving me the keys. I know all about forgotten dog syndrome in hot cars. - Fair enough. ♪ I was lost ♪ ♪ And incomplete ♪ ♪ I didn't know where I should go ♪ ♪ A thousand pounds upon my soul ♪ ♪ And you came ♪ ♪ From nowhere ♪ ♪ And everything fell into place ♪ ♪ You make it better every day ♪ ♪ You took me away ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ You took me away ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ And the world ♪ ♪ Turns for us ♪ ♪ The sun is shining ♪ Whew, thanks, Percy! Ah, I really had to go. I've been holding it for like, 40 miles. What lovely hydrants you have on this street. - Aren't they though? They use bronze molded barrels with designer exterior paint. - Huh, I thought they looked a little bolder and brighter than usual. - Wow, I'll have to try one out before we leave. - [Percy] Totally, this is a real pet friendly neighborhood. Even animal control is run by a couple of Boston terriers. - Cool! - Speaking of pets, where's Bella? Did she not come with you? - Uhh. - She's with us. She stayed in the truck. - In the truck? But it's 85 degrees. She could suffocate. Are the windows down? - Oh, the air conditioning's cranked up high and she's listening to the radio loud. - Oh. - She doesn't really wanna be bothered. - She's still upset about the ear thing, huh? - Yeah, it's kind of a sticking point. - Well, we live, we learn. I've calmed down a lot. You tell her how sorry I am? - Oh yeah. - Nothing doing, eh? - She'll come around in her own time. - Well, tell her my door's always open. Just so long as my owner's not home. Then it's most definitely locked. I'll even wear a muzzle if it'll make her feel better. - That's so nice of you, Percy, and, and well, we'd love to say we dropped in today to catch up and let bygones be bygones. The truth is we're in trouble. - Oh? - Big trouble. - Oh, do tell. - Our parents' marriage is on the rocks. - Our mom moved out to have her own space. - [Percy] Oh, the old I need my space line. - Yeah, but we know she still loves us, and dad, too. - Super loved, our mom's the best. - And our dad's an awesome guy. They're made for each other, they really are. They just need some help seeing that. - So, we're gonna find mom in New York and remind her of all the love she left behind. - The three of us are bound to open her eyes. - It takes three to make a thing go right. - It takes three to make it not bite. - Ha ha ha, can't argue with that. So, what do you dogs need from me? - Well, we're kinda the subjects of a nationwide manhunt. - Wowza, kinda? - Remember that nasty cat Jean Clawed who tried to have you for dinner until we shooed him off? - How could I forget? If it weren't for you guys, I'd have been a salted and seasoned parakeet dinner. - Sadly, he doesn't forget either. He's been online stalking us and he just reported us to the authorities. - Reported you? But you're just three dogs on a road trip. What's wrong with that? - Uh, we sorta stole the RV outside. - Oh. - And it sort of belonged to some mayor. - You guys stole a mayor's truck? Way to stay low profile. - Hey, we haven't exactly done this kinda thing before. - Well, I did steal another truck once, but that was a long time ago. I was young and it's a long story. - Well, just we're winging it. - Ha, I see what you did there. Winging it, I like it. Listen, I have some friends in high and low places. If you ever find your tails against the wall, or you've got the pedal to the metal and the man's in hot pursuit, I can hook you up. - Really? Thanks, Percy. - Yeah, I always knew we'd make connections in the underbelly. - I prefer to think of it as the resistance, a network of anonymous animals fighting the good fight. - We're just glad you're our friend. Say, you don't happen to have any marrow treats, do ya? - It was really cool of Percy to hook us up with that signal scrambler. Now we can use that cellphone without fear of being spied on. - Pfft, whatever. She was obviously just showing off, like always. - You oughta forgive and forget, Bella. What happened was a long time ago. Percy's matured a lot. She's a great bird and always helps us when we're in a pinch. - Yeah well, she didn't bite your ear. You don't know what it feels like. I still get nightmares. - That's cool, Bella. Just remember, time heals all wounds. Whenever you're ready, Percy'd love to see you again. - Hopefully, she holds her breath. Hey, somebody's calling us. - [Gus] Don't answer it. Only the mayor's people have that number. - And Jean Clawed! - Right. Throw it out the window. - Gosh, I'm not throwing it out the window. I have a feeling this phone'll come in handy at some point. And I feel like I recognize this number. - It's a bad idea, Bella. Don't do it. - Oh, why not? Yellow? Marcus! - Bella, I'm so glad to see your face. - Hey, Marcus! - Hi, Marcus. We're so glad it's you. - Hey guys. I should've known you three wouldn't go down without a fight. - How'd you get this number, Marcus? - Yeah, the phone's not ours. - Snaggles gave it to me. So, the news reports are true, huh? - What're the news reports? (helicopter whirring) Uh, guys? - Is that helicopter chasing us? - You three are all over the news. You're on every channel. They even preempted Dancing with Mutts to follow you. (Gus gasps) - They preempted DWTM? We really are big news. - Thanks for the tip, Marcus. - My pleasure. Us dogs gotta stick together. Run 'em ragged, Buddy, woof woof. - That chopper's closing in. Can this thing go any faster? - Hit the gas! - [Cop] I have the RV in sight up ahead. How shall I proceed, sergeant? - [Sergeant] They are a danger to the public. We must get them off the streets. Apprehend the suspect at any cost. - [Cop] 10-4. - Go, go, go! - Well, the pedal's to the metal, and the man's in hot pursuit, Buddy. Think it's time to cash in that favor? - Favor? What favor? - Percy made us an offer and I think we'll take her up on it. - Oh, wonderful. - Get her on the phone, Bella! - Uh-uh, I'm not calling that ear mangler, mm-mm, mm-mm. - Bella, please, this is an emergency. She can help. - Okay, okay. But just so you know, you guys owe me. - [Buddy] Fine, we owe you. - [Gus] Please make the call, Bella. - Bella, I'm so glad you called. I wanna apologize. - Save it, savage. Buddy and Gus want that favor you offered. - Oh. - We're in a real jam, Percy. Is it too late to call for backup? - Please, oh, please, please, please, please. - Gotcha, I'm on it, guys. Keep your eye to the skies. - [Buddy] Don't worry, we will! - [Cop] I'm right on top of the target now, sergeant. - [Sergeant] Apprehend the suspects by any means necessary, officer. - 10-4. - What's happening? Do you guys see anything? - Just that big metal mosquito bearing down on us. I knew I should've stayed in my dog bed. You two have been nothing but trouble since the day I met you. I don't know what my mom ever saw in your dad. - Wow, tell us how you really feel, Bella. - Uh, I think she just did. - I know, Gus, I was being facetious. - Guys, look, up there. - [Gus] Huh? Where? Oh, heh heh. - [Cop] What the? Where'd these birds come from? - [Sergeant] Birds? What birds? Update me on the situation, officer? Officer? - I can't see. I gotta diverge. - Diverge? No, engage, officer, engage. - [Cop] I lost sight of the target, sergeant. I lost them. - What? No! - Those birds threw off the helicopter. It pulled back, it's gone. - [Gus] Woo-hoo! - [Buddy] Yes, she did it! Percy did it! - All right! Percy's not so bad after all, is she? - Whatever, let's just get far away from here. Drive! (Gus and Buddy laughing) (upbeat country music) - Wow, talk about badlands. Where are we, Buddy? - Somewhere in Kansas, I think. All those twists and turns I took trying to make sure that helicopter didn't catch up to us got me all turned around again. - So, what you're saying is, we're lost? - If you wanna be technical about it. - I do! - I'd rather be lost and free than found in a jail cell. - No doubt, Gus. - Well, I'd rather be anywhere else right now. This is an ill-planned and dangerous trip. - Eh, look on the bright side, Bella. - Okay, exactly what side is that? - We've been on the road for a whole day and we haven't eaten a thing since we left home in California. - Is this supposed to be the bright side? Because I'm not feeling it. - Yeah, it doesn't sound real good, Buddy. - Look around, guys. We're in a small Midwestern town. Americana, Normal Rockwell, mom and apple pie. - Mom? - Pie? Where? Where? - Calm down, both of you. It's just a figure of speech. My point is, these people live simple lives. They know their neighbors, they trust their neighbors. Lots of them don't even lock their doors, especially in the daytime. - Oh, so you're not satisfied with taking other people's cars. Now you wanna break into a house. - Buddy, I don't know how to say this, but you need to get some help. - Totally! - Guys, guys, hear me out. Look around. These folks have pets, farm animals. We can probably find some bowls of food outside. - Hey, yeah. Maybe we can even find a whole trough. - Right, there's food everywhere. And even if we don't spot anything, it's a workday. People are in the office or in the fields. We can scout an empty house and raid the fridge. - Wow, yeah. My tummy's growling just thinking about it. (Bella growling) - I think that's Bella, actually. - Oh. - I think this is a terrible idea, just like every other decision you guys have made on this journey. - We've come this far. We must be doing something right. - Yeah, I say we go for it. We'll think clearer after we've eaten. - I agree. I'm taking a right and slowing down up here. Keep your eyes peeled for bowls. Look along the sides of the houses and in the pastures. - Like a pack of vagrants. - Better than a pack of prisoners. - I heard that. You guys watch that side. I'll watch mine. - Yum yum. I can smell the home cooking already. - All that driving, all those animals, and not a single bowl of food or water anywhere. - Yeah, what's wrong with this place? Don't these folks get hungry, or thirsty? - They just keep their town tidy, I guess. Not a lot of clutter. - Not a lot of anything from the looks of it. Maybe we should move on, find another place. - [Buddy] We have, that's why we're stopped here. - This place? It looks like a gingerbread house. - Mmm (giggles) gingerbread. - I'm not going in there. There might be somebody on the lookout. - Yikes, you think? - Yes, I came on this trip to find my mom, not to wind up scolded and chased by some angry local. - [Gus] She might have a point, Buddy. - Point, shmoint. My point is there's clearly nobody home in that house. And I bet the refrigerator's stocked to the gills. And the pantry, too. - I love pantries. There's a pantry? How do you know? - [Buddy] You guys, just be quiet and follow my lead, all right? - [Bella] You better be right about this. - [Buddy] Shh, come on. (Gus burping) (Gus giggling) - [Gus] I love chicken fried rice. - [Bella] Oh, I've never been this full in all my life. - No kidding. You ate three containers of pad thai by yourself. I don't know how you hold it all down. - I'm not sure I will. Where's the bathroom in this house, anyway? - Let's not press our luck. We already ate these poor folks out of house and home. - Poor folks? Did you see the Chinese spread we just feasted on? They must've spent hundreds on it. - I was just using a figure of speech, Buddy, like you always say. - Okay, you two, much as I like to lie here on this kitchen floor and bask in my glorious fullness, we should think about getting that RV back on the road and to New York? - I agree. But which way do we go from here? We've turned around and around and around, like tops. I'm completely lost. - And I'm no better. We took detours off of detours in all the excitement. I'm totally twisted around. - So, what you're saying is it's just another day for you? - Ha, ha, ha. (Gus burps) - Woo, excuse me. - Ew, Gus, give it a break, will ya? - Sorry. - Hey, what if we just follow the sun? Let nature be our guide. That's how the old frontier dogs used to do it. - Oh, very nice. Now we're frontier dogs. That's like a polite way of saying strays. - I've said it before, Bella. We are no strays. We have a home and parents who care about us. - That's right. I miss dad. - And I miss mom. - You guys think I don't? That's the whole reason we're doing this. We love our people as much as they love us. And no matter what's going on with them, we're not gonna take this split lying down. - It does feel pretty good on this floor, though. - I know, right? I could veg here all day. - I could straight up nap. - Gus, don't you even think of devouring a whole fridge full of Chinese food and then falling asleep right next to me. - Oh, yeah, no. - What? - What do you mean what? Remember that time you got into the spaghetti pot and conked out while Bella binge-watched soap operas? - Oh, yeah. - Ew, I can still smell it. We had to keep the windows wide open for a whole month. - In February! - Oh yeah. I remember that. Ah, those were great times, you guys. We were a family then. - Great times? - Can we just relax a little while longer and let all these noodles digest? - I guess we can spare a little bit of time. Maybe they have Puptflix. - Soap operas, anyone? (Buddy laughing) - [Buddy] Man, this takes me back. - I know, it's so great. I grew up on this stuff. - Wait a minute. I thought you grew up on the streets. - I did. I had to watch it on the TV screens in the old department store windows on 6th Street, but at least I got to watch. - What in the world is this nonsense? That human looks goofy. Since when did humans start dressing like chickens? - Oh, I've heard about this. It's called cosplay. They hold big conventions, and people come from all over to dress up. - No, I think this guy's trying to sell eggs locally. - Hmm, I don't think I'd wanna buy anything that chicken man's selling. - I agree. - [Gus] Oh, that chicken man reminds me. - Reminds you of what? - [Gus] Of my friend, Miss Priss. She lives around these parts. - [Bella] Does she look anything like that? - No, nothing like that. She's an actual chicken and she's super street wise. She was a famous graffiti artist specializing in chicken scratch until the city started cracking down. She went underground around the same time I met Buddy. When we got adopted, I lost touch with her. - And she's out here now? - Yeah, I heard through the grapevine that she gave up the street art lifestyle and got hooked up with some animal rescue group who moved her to a dairy farm. If we can find her, she'd definitely know the best way to get to New York, fast. - I don't see what we have to lose. Let's look her up. - I don't know. If she's anything like your other bird friend, we might need to tape up my ears. - Aha, you mutts thought you made a clean getaway, eh? - Jean Clawed? But how? - In the world? - Are you on screen? That's an old TV tube. It's not even hackable. - I have my methods, Luddites. You should know by now us cats are superior to you dogs in every way. - But this is above and beyond. That television isn't even online. - Ha, heh heh, if there's a problem, yo, I'll solve it. - What? - Nevermind, square pegs. I just dropped in to inform you I've alerted the neighbors that pesky stray dogs have broken into that house. Consequently, you don't have much time. So eat up, mutts, and beware of the concerned neighbors who are gathering outside. - Why you dirty, rotten-- - Hope you parked that RV close, Buddy. You'll need to get back on it quick. - You're not a cat, Jean Clawed. You're a rat. - Oh, that's a compliment coming from you, Bella. Best of luck, mutts. You're going to need it. (banging on door) - Ee, oh, what do we do? Be quiet, maybe they'll go away. - [Bella] They're not gonna go away, Gus. - [Neighbor] Hey, I know you're in there. Open up or we're calling the cops. - [Gus] Oh, no! - [Buddy] Maybe we can reason with them. - [Bella] How do you propose we do that? - We'll just-- - I'm listening. - [Buddy] I don't know. We need to get out of here now. - Let's go out the back door. - [Buddy] The RV's parked out front. We'd still have to march right past whoever's out there to get to it. - Then we'll ditch it. It's stolen, anyway. The whole country's probably looking for it by now. - [Bella] If we lose our truck, it'll take us weeks to get to New York, and mom and dad could get divorced by then. - [Buddy] Mom and dad will never get divorced. Things aren't that bad. - [Bella] They will be once mom gets wind that dad lost the dogs and she thinks her precious sparkle fur princess is gone forever. - [Buddy] Oh no, no, no, no. We have to get back in that RV, you guys. - I know, play rabid. We'll bust right out the front door growling and snarling and foaming at the mouth. No one in their right mind would approach a rabid dog. Much less three rabid dogs. - [Bella] That's not a bad plan. We all have pretty good snarls. But how do we fake foaming at the mouth? - The fridge is loaded with soda cans. Quick, guzzle some soda and let's do this. - Yeah! - [Cop] Their crime spree is escalating, sergeant. We received eye witness reports that the suspects just robbed a home in Salina, Kansas. Descriptions indicate they could very well be rabid. - [Sergeant] Notify the local sheriff's office. I want every officer within a 200 mile radius to descend on that town. They won't get away with this, not on my watch. Mobilize all tactical units. These perps are going to the pound. - Yikes, I can feel the collar tightening around our necks, you guys. The leash is pulling harder. - I know what you mean. That no good Jean Clawed is popping up at every turn. Every time we think we're safe, there he is to throw a sardine in our plans. - Jean Clawed can't stop us. He's been a nuisance for years, but that's all he is. He's nothing but a cat who can type with high speed WiFi. - I don't know about you guys, but I think he's upping his game. Need to find my old friend, Miss Priss, and find her fast. - Okay, which way do I go? - I have no clue. - That's reassuring. - But I know who will. Bagel, get on that phone, Bella. - Uh-huh, aren't you glad we didn't throw it out the iwndow now? I told you we might need it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hopefully, Bagel still has the same phone number. - Bagel, long time no see. - Guys, what's up? Did you finally get that mess sorted out? Your mugs' all over the news. - We're working on it, Bagel. - You better work fast. You got yourself in hot water when you cross state lines. They're setting up dragnets in every city and on every highway to catch you. - If you'd have told me two days ago that I'd be a notorious fugitive on the run by week's end, I'd have told you to go chase a bone. - At least you're a stylish fugitive, Bella. - Aww, thanks, Buddy. I wish I could say the same for you. I hope they're showing my good side on TV. - Which side is that? - I don't know. Tell me what you think. - Bagel, we need your help. - Over the phone? Come on, dog. I'm probably gonna get in big trouble just for talking to you. - Then pass us on. We need to find Miss Priss. Do you know where she lives? - Miss Priss? Yeah, she lives at Sunny Side Up Farm. - Sunny Side Up Farm. How do we get there? - Where are you now? - Where are we now? - Route 24. - Route 24. - Okay, it'll be over easy. - I'm starting to get hungry for eggs. - Tell us, Bagel, tell us. - You're closer than you think. Use your canine instincts. Roll down the windows and you'll catch the scent. Just follow it to the farm. - Will do. Thanks, Bagel. - Uh-huh. Do me a favor. Don't call me again from this phone. - Okay, we won't. See you when we get home, buddy. Snouts out, you guys. Let's find that farm. Here it is. It's Sunny Side Up Farm. - I can see why they call it that. - You mean you can smell why they call it that? Those eggs smell delicious. - Stay focused, you guys. We need to find Miss Priss' coop before she turns in for the night. - Ahem, right. - What does Miss Priss look like? How do we spot her? - I don't know, she's a chicken. They have feathers and two chicken legs. - Gus, we can't just march through the gates and start calling her name. The farmers will shoo us away. - Or call the cops. - Right, and they'll catch us. - I don't know about you guys, but I plan on getting back home, curl up in my dog bed in front of a crackling fire with a smile on my face and mom petting my full belly. I do not want to be apprehended. - Hmm, I see your point. - Let's circle around back and find a fence we can breach. Hopefully, we can sneak up on the chicken coops without drawing too much attention to ourselves. - Good idea, let's go. (door creaking) - [Bella] Hey, after we find Gus's friend, maybe these farmers will invite us in and offer us some eggs. Scrambled eggs, mm, with bacon. - [Gus] Mmmm, bacon. - [Buddy] Or maybe the chickens will go ballistic at the sight of three strange dogs and the farmers will make bacon out of us. - [Gus] Buddy, you're not following your own advice. Remember our goal, think positive. - [Buddy] Right, right, sorry. - Come on, the chicken coop smell's getting stronger. It can't be far now. Uh, uh, Miss Priss? - [Miss Priss] Gus? Is that you? - Yes, hi. - My goodness! It's been forever. What're you doing here? Did the rescue group finally pick you up? - Uh, you haven't been watching TV, I take it? - [Miss Priss] Heavens no. I haven't seen a TV screen since you and I used to sit on the 6th Street curb and watch the department store sets play in the window. We live simply here. We enjoy nature and lay eggs. - [Gus] No more graffiti art? - [Miss Priss] No, I'm happily retired. Although, I have tutored a few of these birds on their chicken scratch. - Sounds nice. - It is. Tell me, what's happening in the world? - Oh you know, same old, same old. - Yeah, nothing you'd care about. - [Miss Priss] Who are your friends? - These are my housemates and besties, Buddy and Bella. - [Miss Priss] Housemates? So you did find a home. I'm so happy for you, Gus. - More like a home found me. I got lucky. - But now it's all falling apart. - [Miss Priss] Falling part? Oh no. - We left California. On our way to New York to find our mom, Miss Priss. We got ourselves in some trouble. Now we're all turned around. - We're just driving. - And driving. - And hungry. - And thirsty. - And we love eggs. - And bacon. - We really love bacon. - [Miss Priss] Well, you've come to the right place. Sunny Side Up Farm has the best breakfast around. - You don't say. - Miss Priss, you don't happen to know how we can get to New York from here, do ya? - I sure do. But it's quite a long walk. - Oh, we have a truck. - You do? - Yes, an RV with great gas mileage, by the way. - Absolutely. - Well, in that case, you want to head north and skirt the Great Lakes. It's a fast and scenic drive. - We like fast and scenic. - Yeah! - How's the police presence? Are there lots of state troopers out there? - [Miss Priss] Gus, if I didn't know better, I'd say you dogs were in more trouble than just being lost. - Well, well, it's a long story. - [Miss Priss] I have the time, but something tells me, you don't. - You always were smart, Priss. - [Miss Priss] You know it, kid. Go north until you hit Route 5, then head east. You'll see New York in no time. - Thank you! - It was nice meeting you, Miss Priss. - And she means that. She hates birds. - Oh, well. You dogs be careful out there. - Will do, Miss Priss. Thanks again. - [Miss Priss] Anything for an old friend, Gus. Keep your nose to the wind, and drive safe.

Miss Priss' directions have been the easiest ever. I've yet to see a cop car anywhere. - Shh, don't jinx us, Buddy. - Yeah, it would be just like you to look a gift horse in the mouth and ruin everything. - Thanks for the vote of confidence, Bella. - What confidence? - Hey, I got us this far, didn't I? Give me some credit. - Keep driving, Buddy. We're making up a lot of lost time. - [Buddy] You just keep that gas pedal warm, pal. I'll do the rest. - That's what I'm afraid of. - Going somewhere? - Oh great, you again? - You know it, Bella. You mutts might've escaped California, narrowly avoided disaster in Utah, and fled Kansas by the skin of your wet black noses, but now, it's the end of the road for you. Time's up. - We'll decide when our time's up, Jean Clawed, not you. - Au contraire, mon frere. That's a French, by the way. (cackles) - Duh, I know. I used to vacation on the Riviera every spring. - You did? - Yes, before my mom met your dad and you rogues and stopped traveling. Now the dog park's our most exotic getaway. - What a drag. - I know, right? - Well, I hope you're ready for a new destination, the inside of a kennel cage because you're all about to be curbed. (cackles) - Buddy, they found us! - Who found us? Where? - Look up. - [Cop] I found the RV, sergeant. They won't get away this time. You dogs in the RV, pull over now! - Yikes, this is it. We're finished. - Don't say that, Gus. As long as this truck's rolling, we're in the game. - Game, this is no game, Buddy. That chopper is about to blast us right off this road. - Not if I have anything to say about it. Hang on! - Driver, pull over, right now. - Gas pedal, Gus, hard! - What're you doing? - I'd do as he says, mutts. I told them just how dangerous you three are. These officers aren't fooling around. - [Gus] You dirty rat, Jean Clawed. You won't get away with this. - [Jean Clawed] Ah, I already have. - Blocked, I've had enough of that declawed dork. - Are you guys okay? - Snaggles, we're hanging in there. - By the tips of our claws. - I've been trying to call you back constantly, but your signal's been scrambled like an egg. - Hey, we never did get any eggs back at Sunny Side Up Farm. - [Gus] We'll go back someday, Bella, if we ever get out of this mess. - [Buddy] Jean Clawed the cat's been hacking into the phone and scrambling our signal, Snaggles. - But I just blocked him so we should be good. Spoke too soon. - You guys okay? I've been trying to call you like crazy. - Pfft, don't bother. - Come on, Bella. How many times can I apologize? I'm sorry about your ear! - Percy, are those bird buddies of yours still flying high? - Yes, they're heading north for the spring actually. - Mind sending them our way one more time? We're on Route 24, mile marker 243. - Will do, hang tight. - Blocked. - Bella! - Why'd you do that? - I can't stand her. - But she helps us. - The birds are on their way, it's fine. - [Cop] This is your final warning. Pull over, or else. - Or else? What do you think he means by or else? - He means he's gonna blast us to the big doghouse in the sky. - There's a doghouse up there too? Where? - Hey, guys. You're the talk of the town. The whole neighborhood's following your chase on the news. Everyone's jumping up and down going wild. - [Buddy] Uh-oh, I wonder if dad's watching. - [Gus] He's gonna be so mad if he is. Maybe we should've stayed put at home. - Too late now. But look on the bright side. He'll probably come visit us a lot after they sentence us to the kennel for the rest of our natural lives. - Yikes! - Hey, hang on. Someone wants to say hi. - You guys are folk heroes. Like modern day Robin Hoods. - Mom always did say I'd be famous one day. - You are. Oh, Bella, you're gonna be a role model for loyal pets everywhere. - Well, I'll be. Faster, Buddy. Press that pedal harder, Gus. - I'm only nine pounds. I'm pressing as hard as I can. - [Cop] This is your last chance. Stop the truck and step out with your paws up. - Never, this is it, you guys. There's no turning back. We're going all the way. - Well I mean, if the whole world's watching, we have to give the viewers what they want. - That's right. The heck with it. Keep driving, Buddy, until we're in New York and our mom and dad are back together. - All right. - We will not give up. - Never. We may be little dogs, but we have a hero's heart. - We do. - We do? - You bet, Gus. - Right. And apparently, I have an adoring public to appease when this is all over. - Wow, you're right. Hey, we probably all do. - Well, every great star needs a cast of supporting players. You two will suffice. Hey look, up above. (rock music) - [Cop] What, these birds again? I don't believe it. Where do they come from? I have no choice but to call the mission, sergeant. - [Sergeant] Negative, officer, stay on course. We must apprehend those animals. - Uh, not possible. I'm pulling out, sergeant, I'm pulling out. (rock music) - [Gus] He's gone. We did it, Buddy, we shook the choppers. - [Bella] We're stars. - [Buddy] The birds are the ones who did it, guys. We just kept our cool and stayed focused. - Yeah, Percy came up big for us again. - No doubt, we'll have to thank that bird someday. - Pfft, okay fine, but I'm not getting close enough for her to nip my ears. - Fair enough, Bella. (laughs) (Gus laughing) - Hey, hey, since we have a little breather, we should ditch this RV. It sounds like everyone's got an eye out for it now, and I'm pretty sure the mayor needs it to get back from his bird watching trip. - That's right, ease off the gas, Gus. Let's slow down so I can wave to the folks. - We're not out of the woods yet, guys. Stay on that gas, Gus, New York's not far now. - Really? I have no concept down here of how far we've driven. Everything's been so fast and furious. It feels like we just rolled out. - Well, we've come a long way, almost clear across the country. - Wow. - I think we'll be seeing the city in no time. - [Bella] Wow, this is it, the Big Apple. - [Gus] There's apples? I'll have one. - [Buddy] Look at this place, it's huge. I never knew they made cities this big. - It's incredible, and fitting for a dog of my new-found stature to arrive in the city where dreams come true. - [Buddy] If you can make it here, Bella, you'll make it anywhere. - [Gus] Hey guys, I'm still waiting for that apple, you know? - We'll stop for a bit to eat soon, Gus. New York's a very dog-friendly town. I bet we could dine just about anywhere we wanted, and they'd welcome us with open arms. - Let's pick some place out of the way. I don't want to get mobbed with selfie requests. - Sounds like it's already going to her head, Buddy. (Bella gasps) - [Bella] I think I just saw our faces on a billboard, back there. - Probably a wanted poster. - We're wanted by the whole world. - Okay, you two, let's not forget why we're here. - Mom! - Mom! - That's right, and we don't know how to find her. So we'll have to keep our nostrils open and pick up her scent. (Bella sniffing) - [Bella] I think, I think I've got something. Yes (sniffing) it's her! - Are you sure? - It's definitely mom. I know her scent anywhere. (Buddy sniffing) - [Buddy] I think she's right, Gus. Smells like mom to me. Which way, Bella? - Hang a left up ahead. Then right, left, right, proceed straight. She'll be there somewhere. - Keep your claws crossed, everyone. Here we go. (upbeat music) - Wow. It's quaint. - Yeah, it's way different than back home. - [Gus] Do you think mom misses us? - Pfft, of course she misses us. Well, she misses me, for sure. - What if she's forgotten all about us and doesn't even remember us when we knock? - That's crazy, Gus. She's our mom. Moms don't just forget, right? - There's only one way to find out. (knocking on door) (dogs barking) - [Linda] Bella, Buddy, Gus, my babies. - Hi, mom. - Hi, mom! - [Gus] You remember us? - [Bella] And that's how it happened. We parked that RV on the outskirts of the city by the George Washington Bridge and the police found it in a matter of minutes. By the time they realized they'd been had, we were long gone. The mayor made it home from his bird watching trip just in time for dinner. Mom booked all three of us on her return flight to California, and since we were all raised not to tell fibs, we came clean and spilled the beans about everything. - [Gus] Beans? Where? Gee, I want some. - Shh, lemme finish, Gus. These viewers want to know how things turned out. - [Gus] Oh, right. - [Bella] When we finally landed and got back home, dad was understandably frantic. He'd been watching the news reports on us the whole time. In his mind, he lost his wife and his pets. Imagine the look on his face when we all walked in. Was priceless. - [Gus] He was happy, I can tell you that. - [Bella] Mom and dad sat down and talked things out. Then they hugged things out. - [Gus] Aww. (chuckles) - [Bella] Long story short, their time apart helped them realize that they cared about each other just as much today as they did when they first fell in love. And now, here we are. - [Gus] In romantic Venice. - [Bella] Enjoying breakfast on the canal. Ah, it's gorgeous here. - [Gus] You know, I'm still waiting on that apple, by the way. - Eh, I know you are, Gus. I know you are. (upbeat music) (peaceful music) (Buddy sniffing) - I could eat. Think they'll toss some scraps down here for us? - Don't think small, Buddy. We're bonafide celebrities now. That's why we have to dine under the table. The crush of our fans would ruin this restaurant's nice ambiance. I'm sure the maitre d' will bring two five-star plates out for us any second now. - Right, how could I be so forgetful? - You're a dog. - And you are? - Princess Bella, sparkle fur extraordinaire. (laughs) - That sure was crazy what we did. - Sure was, exciting too. And fun, in a weird way. - Yeah, but it worked. Just look at mom and dad. They're happier than ever. - They sure are. Seeing them like this warms my heart. And to be here with you does too. - Oh yeah? I thought you were sick and tired of me and Gus. - Eh, you guys are okay. - Yeah, you're okay, too. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - I love you, big brother. - Love you too, sis. Think they'll bring that food out soon? - They'd better or else Gus is gonna raid that kitchen. - [Gus] I just wanted an apple, come on. Just one apple. - [Linda] Oh no, is that Gus I hear? - [Bob] Gus, come here, Gus, here boy. - [Linda] Just like old times. (dogs laughing)
