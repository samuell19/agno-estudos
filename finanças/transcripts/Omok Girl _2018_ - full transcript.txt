Presented by SK Broadband Produced & Distributed by INDIESTORY Inc. A square ring with 19 vertical and horizontal lines and 361 intersections. As much as it's called a microcosm of life it's the place where I build my 'house' against all kinds of tricks in one game of victory, risking one's survival! That's about the Go game. This is just a drama about 'Omok'. Baduk LEE PARK Sewan Youngnam CHO LEE Ji-Won Glasses KIM AHN Woo-yeon Housemate CHANG Haetsal Coach - KIM Ki-moo Bok-shim PARK - LEE Jung-haeng Double Three KIM Jung-Young Omok Girl [First Move] Center Point First stone must be at the center. The glory days of my life came too fast. Baduk LEE (1-year-old) (Baduk is Go game in Korean.) Born as a Go game prodigy. I grew up with high expectations. "I'm not sure that I could lose." 'Go Prodigy Wins Again' So, I had to always win. Eunpyung-gu's Pride. Fighting! Go Prodigy Baduk LEE But, one day, when I felt that I was just going to lose, I no longer knew where to put the Go stone. Time's up. When I became afraid of losing, I ended up quitting Go. I didn't know it then. That I'd be working part-time at a Go club years later. Where did the Omok player go? Wait a bit. Baduk LEE - Former Prodigy ★★ Young-nam CHO - Stubborn One ★ Ten. Nine. Eight... As an adult, you want to win a kid that badly? Yeah. Totally. Seven. Six. Five. Four... By blocking here, you can defend and attack at the same time. It the Black stone takes the lead, you could win in 3 moves... - Whatchu doing? - Then, from the white side... Will you place it here and block here? Interesting. Or, should you place it here? Hey, you. - Hey! - Yes? Oh! Oh, my! I'm so sorry. I meant to keep it to myself, but it must've slipped out. How annoying! Oh, I... well... I was standing here, wondering if I could put this up. Do whatever you want. Thank you. I want to put it here. - Hey! That's where he hinted at! - No. My plan was there, too! Miss White Stone! Please have a look at the poster! Thank you! 1st Jungsoo-dong Omok Competition Cash Prize $500 At that time, I had no idea that I'd be entering that competition. That is, until I found out that a few months' worth of rent had vanished. Housemate - Rent Criminal ★ At that time... I felt so 'E minor'. A while ago Excuse me! Excuse me! You have a pleasant look. Me? Yes, you look... Aren't you a musician? Yes. Well... It's all written on your face. We're in spiritual training. - I'm carrying a guitar, so... - No. It's written on your face. You look very blessed, but you suffer physical pains? Your back or your wrist? Your neck or shoulder? No. I'm good. Things aren't going your way? Isn't it hard to meet people? You know that I have stage fright. So, they said it'll be gone it I stick this on my guitar. But, all bullshit. So, anyway... The landlady said she'll deduct from the deposit. It's fine. It's not your fault. Those who took advantage of you are the bad guys. Bastards. Baduk. You're... I'll help out with the rent. I'll take two jobs. Thank you! I'll do the dishes and everything. I'll even clean and take out the trash! I'll even get a part-time job. Yeah, okay. I couldn't tell her. That I already had the deposit deducted in half. 1st Jungsoo-dong Omok Competition How about it? It's today. Seriously? Seriously. Got nothing to lose. Not true. There's an entry fee of $10. Many drops make a shower. So let's stick some eyes on. This work was really hard to get. Many drops just make bigger drops. I'll get $500 in one game. So, please take care of here for me, my friend. - Hey! - Let's go! Go! Go! 500! 500! 500! We're here for the competition. - To play? Both of you? - Yes! One moment, please. Name, contact, kyu/dan level. Please write them here. Level? There are levels in Omok? White Stone. Miss White Stone! It's that crazy... It's him. The hint guy. You really came! This'll be fun. Miss Black Stone came, too. I'm not Black Stone, but Young-nam. Young-nam CHO. My bad. Do you work here? Yes. And, I'm also a player. You can fill out this entry form. But, we don't know our levels. Miss White Stone is 7-kyu. Miss Black, no. Young-nam'll be 15-kyu. Do you know her? No. I saw her once while putting up posters. I think it's her first competition. Then, they're beginners? No, a strong contender. Please have this. Thanks to you two, we'll be able to have quarterfinals. The entry forms will be drawn to assign you in the tournament. First time competing? Didn't even know there was an Omok competition. Oh, right. It'll be different from how you usually play. You see, there are rules. It's' rather complicating and there's a time limit. Can you do Double Three? Not only that, but there's the Renju Rule. But, no need to worry. It'll be easy once you try. Whatever. Omok's all the same. Oh, I saw your form, and... is your name really Baduk LEE? Yes, it is. Well, that's... Oh, I'm sorry. It's a very funny name. I'm Glasses KIM. - Hey, even your name's... - Oh, the list of matches is out. He's changing the subject when even his name's funny. Shit. [Second Move] Stone Placing Placing a stone on the Omok board. Young-nam CHO - Glasses KIM Hotwing CHUNG - Baduk LEE Hotwing CHUNG? What's with the name here? Look here. In 2 wins, it's second place. 3 wins is first place. That's $500! I told you. It's a piece of cake! Awesome! If we both go to the finals, it's $600! $600! That's a bummer. For me to meet Baduk, I'll have to get to the finals. Young-nam, may the good player win. Stooping low and low. Bring it on! Hey, come on. 600! 600! 600! 600! - By the way... - Yes? Your opponent isn't an easy one. Do you know how to play chess? Yes. Why? Because your opponent moves like the horse. The horse? Oh! More hints won't be fair. This'll be fun. He's annoying, right? Yeah. Today, the regular Renju Rule applies. Simply put, a penalty is given to the Black who plays first. Black cannot make Double Three, Double Four, or Six or More in a Row. And, the first move must be placed at the center. 20 minutes for each. After the time's up, there's a 30 second limit. Whatever. Since I'm Black, put it first in the center, right? That's right. Player Hotwing CHUNG Your opponent moves like the horse. Really? Referee! Referee! Isn't that foul play? He keeps doing something else! It's fine if he observes the time. Dang... Ah, please take your time. I'll use the restroom. Glasses KIM (3-dan) The So-called Genius ★★★★★ So annoying! What? Isn't this cheating? This is weird! Making me put it in the center or central point! He keeps lying down! - It's center... - Start over. Now! I was off my guard because he looked lame. No, you can't. Oh, come on! Just one more game! He's eating and playing around over there, and you don't stop him, calling yourself a referee? Please let me play one more game! I'm sorry about that. Oh, shit! Grandpa Hotwing CHUNG (1-dan) Impenetrable Defense ★★★ I told you he moves like a horse. Time's up! What's this? Did you play Go? He's got her. Not a tie. That's too bad. I had forgotten. What it was like to lose. Glasses KIM's Today's Omok Hello. Today's Omok is about Hotwing CHUNG's Netting Strategy. Like moving the horses in chess, he defends by playing like this. Then, he forms a net pattern. Like a fish caught in a net, the opponent can never make five in a row in here. [Third Move] Groundwork Strategic placing of the stones to make five in a row. What's this? Omok. Omok! Shit. So embarrassing. Head Manager, sir. There's no time. Just come in for a sec. Why keep playing when you lost to AlphaGo? I tell you it was all fixed. Two people? Yeah, two. You have to pay first. Never been to a Go club, right? I came when I was little and it's been so long. Ah, well, yeah... Manager OH. Let's have some Odari (squid legs). Head Manager, Mr. OH. Why have Odari right after having stir-fried Ojingeo (squid)? Let's have one, Manager OH. Odari only costs 500 won. Okay? Mr. OH, then you pay 500 won and have the Odari. I'll buy. Hey! One Odari! Out! Out! Out! Out! - Oh, you misunderstood. - We'll only stay for 5 minutes. O? O? Get out! Out! Out! What's with her? Is it because you lost in Omok? No way! Nothing to do with Omok. They kept talking down. They need to fix their bad habits! That's why! Oy. Odeng. Oyster! Oatmeal! Omok! - Hello... - I said, get out! Good bye. I thought you were mad at me. That's a relief. - That's true, too. - What brings you here again? Oh, you left this behind. All the participants get it. 1st Jungsoo-dong Omok Competition Who won first place? - It was me, of course. - Jerk... But, it was so sad because you lost so early. It's because you don't have basic skills. Basic skills in Omok? You just win if you're lucky. Ah! You played the Go game, right? Normally, Go players snub Omok, then get totally smashed. Hey! He's making fun of-me now. Right? He's smiling while mocking me, right? - Bring it on! - No, I'm not! I just think you'll be great if you learn basic skills. You have the talent! You like that. You like hearing that you got talent. Who does? So I came to let you know about this. 6th National Top Omok Competition National competition? First Prize $3000 Second Prize $500 - $3,000! - $3,000...

Don't have to do that much to play Omok. Well, just as I had expected. Expect what? I think you and I are similar. That's offensive. It sounds like a curse. You're afraid of losing, right? Don't get me wrong. Actually, fear can become your friend. Anyway, I just want to meet a strong opponent. Please help me, Baduk. I'll get going, then. What? Help him with what? Don't know. TV? What's that about? - You home? - Yeah. TV's gone. Kept bargaining, so I took off some gas cost. Hey, I told you to sell the fridge later. The guy buying the microwave asked about the fridge, so... The landlady came by. I heard that you already took the rest of the deposit. Hey. I'm sorry. I meant to tell you. I was so sorry that I stuck on eyes without getting any sleep. I guess you didn't feel that sorry. I'm sorry. I'll take care of my share on my own. With what? By entering in that Omok competition again? Well, I could. - You know that I'm a Go prodigy. - Really pathetic. Huh? We're both pathetic! When I turned 27, I thought I'd die after burning up my passion like Kurt Cobain or Jimmy Hendrix. Because of someone, I'm just sticking eyes on stuffed dolls. Why's that because of me? And, when you have onion juice every day to live long, why talk about dying at 27? You're the same, too! How? It's been ages since you quit playing Go. And, without getting a proper job, until when are you going to work part-time at the Go club? It's none of your business! Whether I work part-time or enter the Omok competition. - I'll make up the money! - Yeah, right. You call yourself a musician. But you can't earn anything, so you are here, sticking eyes on stuffed dolls! But, onions are good for your health, right? Get lost. Hey. Hey! I mean... Shit. 6th National Top Omok Competition Entry Form Sign up as General Participant Application registered. If you really want to learn it properly, please visit this address. Teaches for free as well. Anybody here? Hap! That's awesome! Who are you Double Three [Fourth Move] Double Three Formation of 2 open rows of threes. Who are you? I heard that I can learn Omok for free here. Oh. I don't do Omok anymore. I do this these days instead. Sports Stacking. Here. A new name card. Speed Stacker Trainer Double Three - The spelling's wrong. - Never mind. If you got no business, then.. Bye-bye. Oh, okay... - Glasses KIM. That bastard. - Just a minute! Did you just say, Glasses KIM? Yes, that bastar... I mean, he said that I could learn to play Omok if I come here. I see. Know him well? Glasses? Not really. Well, a bit. Did you win? We haven't fought yet. But, I'd like to. Ha! That explains the bad dream I had. All right. I'll teach you my Omok! But, you'd better be determined. My training's rumored to be the toughest in the Omok world. How about it? Are you ready to take it? But, it's free, right? Challenge! Alpha-O Ver 5.1 Alpha-O! Who teaches with books these days? A beginner like you starts by first winning this kid. What are you doing? Go away. Black or White? Why do I have to do this? Ignorant fool! Omok's about physical strength. Think fast. Place the stone with precision. VICTORY Aren't you curious? Why I decided to teach you? Because... - I'm a prodigy? - A long time ago, I had the same type of student like you. He couldn't place the stone because he was afraid to lose. He was none other than... Glasses KIM. At that time, my trainings were famous for being tough. Go home! Students could hardly take it. It was a good game. Among them, Glasses was the most talented one. He had great skills and character. Everybody envied him. You did great enough. But, the problem was... he didn't know how to take a loss. Double Three's Invincible Omok Ideology Glasses KIM! Why are you still up this late? You can't put it there. Glasses KIM? No... Who are you? Answer me. Who are you? Me? It's broken! The seal is broken! Then what happened? Well... he went overboard. By chasing after only the stronger power. - Oh! That's when your eye...? - No. This is because I got a sty in my eye. Oh. Anyway, since that day, I quit teaching anybody. And, he left this vinyl greenhouse. Sounds like bullshit. It's the truth! I'm sure he's hiding something. Hiding? Now that you mention it. - He always wears a glove. - The glove. Yeah, something must be inside that glove. I don't think the glove... Remember. This is my last teaching. It's important to win well. But, it's also important to lose well. In Omok, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. That's just the way everything is. - Where are you going? - Bathroom! Me, too. Are you sleeping? Yeah. - Tomorrow's the competition? - Yeah. I... hope you do well. Yeah. Thrifty Market Here. Eat it. Tatty for Passing With Perfect Score This isn't it. It sure is. It is. This is the one to eat. Now, eat it! You're coming, too? - Of course. I'm your manager. - Yeah, right. Anyway, if you win $3000, you'll cover my travel expenses? No. You have to. I'm your manager. So, how much? Around... Around $200? - What a punk! - $150? [Fifth Move] Omok Placing 5 stones in a row.

Damn! It was bullshit! That Double Three... Did you really go see Double Three? Yes. Thanks to you. I can feel the combat power rising! Then, I'll look forward to the finals in the afternoon. Oh, I'm a seeded player so I don't play in the preliminaries. I just enter the finals. Oh, I see. Oh, I almost forgot. Teacher Double Three asked me to give you this. Do it like this, and... Glasses Kim. Heard you're still annoying. Be careful or you'll pay dearly. Stop being cheeky and stop by. When you come, don't come empty-handed and bring that... Baskin... Baskin. Bring some Baskin Robbins. That's what she said. For me, strawberry flavor in big size! Humans... Group D preliminary match. 30 minutes per person, 30 seconds for reading the move. If you're ready, we'll begin. Go, Baduk LEE! Go! Let's go! Yeah! Win! Win! Go! I won! I won! It was nothing. Did you pass the preliminary? Sure. The round of 16 will begin after lunch. Hey, I should've entered, too! I can't wait. You, too, right? Since it's round of 16 right now... 16, 8, 4, 2... You get $3000 in 4 wins! $3000! From now, it's the real thing. Are the list of matches out, yet? I don't think so. Big sis. When you win $3000, will you use it all for rent? Hearing you call me 'Big sis', I guess money's pretty great. It is. May I sit with you? Well, this guy's sociable. - Thank you. - He's clueless, too. Want to see the match list I got hold of? Although they'll announce it soon. Bok-shim PARK - Baduk LEE After 1 win, I'll be playing against you. Yes. But, you're always unlucky with your opponents. Your round of 16 opponent is them. Why? Why at me? They think we're on the same team. We have a bit of bad history. Baduk LEE - Bok-shim PARK Bok-shim. I'm proud of you. Why? Because you'll rewrite history. Conquer! Conqueror! Nobody can stop us! Even if it's Glasses KIM! Even if it's his minion, Baduk LEE. Even if it's Baduk LEE. - Who are you? - I'm the champion! - Who are you? - I'm the champion! Geo fight! Here I go, the champion! Bok-shim PARK (2-dan) Silly Boxer ★★★ Excuse me. But, I'm not friends with Glasses KIM. Don't be fooled by the sneaky confusion tactics. The champion decides for himself! Yes! Here I go! The champion! Shit... Bok-shim PARK's style-is to confuse the opponent with noisy boxing. Baduk LEE! With Omok skills played in a sheltered life, can you handle this? I'm the champion! Bok-shim PARK! Bok-shim PARK! Bok-shim PARK! Bok-shim PARK! Enough! ♪ Baduk LEE, my friend, ♪ ♪ who plays Omok well ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Her name is Baduk (Go), ♪ ♪ but she plays Omok well ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Go, Baduk! $3000 is ours! ♪ ♪ Win, Baduk! $3000! ♪ ♪ No more stuffed doll eyes! ♪ People, let's be quiet! They're playing Omok! Don't you know 'jung-sook' (silence)? 'Jung-sook'? You mean, me? - No, no. - No? Ms. 'Jung-sook(silence)' KIM $3000! $3000! $3000! $3000! Stop crying, Bok-shim. Although we lost today, we're not finished. - Who are you? - Champion... Can I have your autograph? - Your name is? - Autograph! Baduk LEE - Bok-shim PARK 8th Round Glasses KIM - Baduk LEE May the best player win. We're finally playing! May the best player win. We'll start the quarter final game. In Go, you can recover even if you make a mistake. In Omok, one mistake can affect the life in the game. Ah! Please take your time. You only have one life. Glasses KIM, as expected. He seems to play lightly, but he blocks with strategic moves. At this rate, the Black'll have no more moves and the White will take charge. - What's he saying? - Don't know. Teacher Double Three was right. Yes? About what? Oh, it's nothing. What did she say about me? Oh, it's nothing special. Just that... You're a f**kin' loser who's full of s**t. A f**kin' loser who's full of s**t? It sucks. But, you're still no match for Glasses KIM. So, get him irritated slowly. Omok's a mind game, too. He's weak that way. You're a f**kin' loser who doesn't have any f**kin skills, but just talks s**t. Looks decent, but he's got smelly feet. - And, he still does Myspace. - Really? Doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom. Really? That's sick. It stinks! What's wrong? Lef... Left hand. He does always wear a glove. Something must be in that glove. How brave of you to awake me. Finally, the seal of my left hand's broken! From now on, it's the real deal! Leftie (7-dan) Overboarder ★★★★★★★ - You can't lean against here. - I'm sorry. Bok-shim! Wake up! The seal's finally broken free! The seal? The seal of the left hand! His eyes are open. His eyes are slightly open. They re open! Open! You don't have time for that. Baduk LEE! Try your best to beat me! Is that all you got? Not such great skills. Should I block there first? No. Did he notice? Spicy rice cake? Spicy chicken? Why am I thinking of these? No. Not enough time. Let me think. I can't make a mistake. Let me think. Let me think. Let me think. Let me think. What's this? You're afraid... to lose. Baduk LEE! What are you doing? Make the move! What are you going to do with our rent deposit! Please! I get it, I do! Where do I put it? Hey, you idiot! Stop thinking so hard! So, what if you lose? Just put it where you want to! You thought hard and long, but your move’s disappointing. Take a close look! This is how you play Omok! White Double Three Finished. It's a Double Three. You tried your best, but just be satisfied about letting me out. Huh? Four Blacks Can't you see my Double Three? It's no use. Now, what'll you do? Four Blacks That trick doesn't work with me. Four Blacks Still look like a bad move? This.. this is four by three. Black Four by Three Here! Black stone, Baduk LEE wins! How could I lose... This doesn't make sense. I heard you sometimes win and you sometimes lose in Omok. Even if you lost, it's not the end. Anyway, it was a good game. Wow. He's up. He has the nerve to act till the end. What's with the eyes for stuffed dolls? Baduk. Thank you. Please gather here to take a photo for our website. Quarterfinals Anyway, Big Sis, if you win $3000, you'll cover my travel expenses, right? Now, we won't have to stick eyes on stuffed dolls. I just got to the semifinals. I'll take the photo. One, two! But, this photo never made it to the competition website. After using all my strength playing against Glasses KIM, like a lie, I was eliminated in the next game. After that, I had to stick 30,000 eyes on stuffed dolls. Award 4th Place, Name: Baduk LEE People say that... life is big and complex like the Go game. But, instead of a Go game, isn't life like Omok where trivial and small stuff pile up one after another? My name is Baduk LEE! Despite my name, I play Omok really well. And, I'm the leading character in this Omok drama. Bye!
