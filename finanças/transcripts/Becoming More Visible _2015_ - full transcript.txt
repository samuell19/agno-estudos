Well, this is only like the second time I'’ve ever worn a dress. My old teacher, who'’s now a close friend, actually got it and she never wore it, so she decided to give it to me and I'’m just, like, really giddy on the inside wearing this. And I'’m extremely happy, which is completely different than how my life'’s been. It'’s just, like, completely new to me. It'’s almost like I'm still dreaming or asleep. ♪ I naturally always want to be in this persona, but it'’s just like, I go home. I can'’t really be me. I have to be the person that my parents have known for 18 years, or my neighbors have known for 18 years. That person is just, like, a miserable kid who doesn'’t really do much. So you guys all know that I'’m going through my hormone therapy and everything, and being on testosterone, which makes you crazy. I identify as male completely, and I go by Sean. My mother picked the name, actually, and my middle name was already my grandmother'’s name, so I switched it to my grandfather'’s to still-- I liked the fact that I kept everything in the family. Growing up and looking the way I did, I always got called a boy and it never bothered me. My mother would always correct people, but, you know, it wasn'’t something that was always an issue to me, mentally. I mean, my mom'’s been great about it. It'’s, it's--yeah. It'’s difficult at some points. I mean, she'’s learning a little too much about what comes a part of being trans. This is my roommate'’s room, so don'’t shoot his room, please. This is the little dining room. This is the kitchen. When I get some permanent housing, I may start dropping hints to my family about who Olivia is. I haven'’t done so yet, but I'’m working on it. My mother and I, we text, but we never call each other. We just text, and she still thinks I'’m the person she thought she knew, but wrong. My bipolar, AKA depression, gets the best of me sometimes. Sometimes when I get extremely angry for no reason, I know it'’s one of those days. Today would be an example, but I know how to control it. It'’s just uncontrollable mood swings, that'’s all. But, you know, it is what it is. At first, I was so confident, like about getting surgery, I was mad happy, but I didn'’t know subconsciously, I really, I really was scared as hell, like I had an anxiety attack in the house. The ambulance had to come pick me up and everything '’cause, you know, I was scared. Like deep down inside I was scared because she was making me sign, like, you know, papers, basically-- ah! Their papers, basically like, saying like, you know, there'’s a possibility of death in any type of surgery. I don'’t wanna know, it's okay, I don'’t wanna know no fucking possibility of nothing about me dying, that'’s scary. Ever since I was five years old, I was totally just-- I knew I was gonna be a woman, like I just knew it, but I was in denial within myself because I have a very religious family, and my mom'’s a minister. I have my aunt'’s a minister, the people that I was always around, they didn'’t see for it. And I mean, yeah, I just gradually-- once I got in foster care I became who I am today. ♪ ♪ -Are you a man or a woman? -I'’m a woman. I'’m what you call a transgender woman. I was born a woman, but I was born with a genetic disorder that makes me look more masculine than most women. So like, my voice is kind of deep, I'’m kind of tall, my hands are big. I'’m a girl, I just-- I'’m born a little different than most girls. Growing up was very confusing. I knew what it meant to be gay. I knew what it meant to be straight. I knew what bisexuality was. I had no idea what transgender was, or transsexual. I didn'’t fit in any category. I didn'’t feel gay. I didn'’t feel straight, I didn'’t feel bisexual. I felt like a woman who was attracted to men. So like, how do you explain that at eight, nine years old? Stand clear of the closing doors, please. I was born here, my parents were from Bangladesh. It'’s a small country, mostly Muslim, and they'’re really closely tied to the religion, which is pretty much why I don'’t think they can really understand who I am. It'’s just, like, emotionally and mentally confusing for me. I'’ve came out to my parents about being a woman, but they simply can'’t understand it. I mean, I get where they'’re coming from. They'’re coming from a culture where being transgender doesn'’t--there's not even a word for it in Bengali. So, it'’s a completely foreign idea for them. So I mean, I don'’t blame them for not understanding, but I just wish it was easier and they were more accepting. ♪ I grew up in a neighborhood full of boys, and I was definitely considered what would be a tomboy. I grew up racing dirt bikes and ATVs, and flipping the quads, and definitely just kind of that upbringing of girls could still be kind of masculine in that way because it was a rural area, and that wasn'’t necessarily so bizarre there. There'’s many things that stand out in my mind, now looking back on it. One is I saved my Barbie dolls for my daughter and he said to me, "Give those away to anybody. I'’m never playing with those." I'’m like, "All right, okay." Actually looking back on it, Sean was always extremely boyish, and he was a little tomboy. Rode the quad the hardest, got the highest jumps, was always the leader of the pack with all the boys. Fortunately, we only had boys in our neighborhood, but really, just fit in with all the boys. Hey, Ma, what'’s for dinner? Salmon. Ooh. Since I was little, since I was like five years old, I always had this story, and it sounds crazy, but I always had a story in my head that I was gonna run away from my house and be a girl with blonde hair, and I was gonna marry like a prince or something. I remember my grandmother called me one time. I went to my aunt'’s room, '’cause they lived together. So I went to my aunt'’s room, and I took her lipstick, and I started smearing it on my lips. I grabbed her big boots, they'’re like from the '80s, some boots she had from-- like, you know, a long time ago, they were really big, and I had this big purse I was dragging, and I was in front of the mirror and I was just like feeling myself, feeling myself, I just felt fabulous. And my grandma came in, and you know, she'’s like a Puerto Rican old school grandma. She'’s like, you know in Spanish, she was like, "What the fuck you doing?" You know, I mean like, she was like, "What are you doing?" Like, "What'’s going on?" and I was so embarrassed. She'’s like, "Wash that out of your face, wash that out of your face," et cetera, et cetera. And I went to the bathroom and I just washed the lipstick. I always, I always-- I don'’t know. I just always felt so feminine. When I look at the experience of these trans kids, their parents have to decide at a fairly early stage, are we going to work toward changing this or are we going to work toward accepting it? And the question is whether it is changeable, and I'’ve seen parents who come down on each side, and I'’ve seen kids, in some instances, who were actually going through a brief crisis and ended up being happy in their birth gender, and I'’ve seen kids who could never possibly have any kind of good life until they were allowed to transition. Have a good day, the rest of your day. My mother would buy me masculine clothing. Yes, I had the masculine clothes, but I always had a feminine face. So I was always under the radar for being gay because my face was so feminine. I was born with a feminine face. I didn'’t get surgery. I didn'’t go to California and get my nose done. I was born with all of this, this is mine, and I was bullied just based on my face. I looked like a girl trying to be a boy. [laughing] It is what it is. Now, I prefer straight men. I do get hit on by homosexual men, but I prefer straight men because I'’m a straight woman. Okay. Attention like that I get often. [indistinct remarks] -I'’m scared. -Scared of who? -You. -Shake my hand. Come here, sweetie. [laughing] Sweetie, mm-mm, no. [chuckling] Let'’s go chase those girls, come on. [indistinct conversations] I'’m sorry, [unintelligible]. I don'’t think I look like a man. Even though I hear the insults outside, "That'’s a man, that's a tranny." When I look in the mirror, I don'’t see tranny. I don'’t see a man. I look good, okay? I'’ve been on hormones for almost three months, so I'’m brand new to the transgendered world. In about six months, I should see more results. I basically told them, "Sweetie, I'’m a woman, I'm not a man. I have a deep voice. Deep voices run in my family, so don'’t get it twisted." And I told her, "While I'’m on film, that was very inappropriate of you. Don'’t do it again, okay?" ♪ My senior year was pretty much the first year I began all my transitions and everything. My film teacher, we talked about a book we read over the summer. And I read the book, Luna by Julie Anne Peters, and it'’s about a trans girl and her life. When I met Katherine, Katherine was Imtiaz, and Imtiaz was a shy young man who wasn'’t comfortable in his skin, and he told me so within that first week of school. So I opened up to her about being a transgender myself, about being a woman. I realized that there was nothing in my education that had prepared me for that. After he first told me, I had him come sit in my office and we talked. And then, the first place I went was my father, who was a school psychologist. His suggestion was first to go talk to the other psychologist and the counselor, and so I kind of started going to all the support service providers in the building, and kind of just asking questions first '’cause I didn't want to say anything. You know, I didn'’t want to reveal anything about Katherine when she wasn'’t ready, but I wanted to find out how I could help her. It was really challenging. I couldn'’t imagine what it was like for her, and for me, as a teacher, I didn'’t know, you know, I didn'’t know how to help. You know, I was supposed to give her a grade and I was like, "How do I give her a grade?" You know, I know she'’s struggling. So, she ended up going through the contacts that she knew and found Dr. Steever at Mt. Sinai. So I then went to Dr. Steever through her. And from then on, I began therapy for everything, and then eventually got on hormones, and I'’m here where I am right now. Your voice has gotten a lot deeper. I called the other day and I almost-- I didn'’t recognize it for a second. Yeah, well at work, my nickname is Squeakers, like the Toy Story character. That'’s a good one. Yeah, actually at both jobs now. That'’s attractive. It really is! Well, because at the cafe, you have to yell, "Order up!" all the time. And so, I can'’t get to a high enough level without it cracking terribly. I remember when I was little, I was definitely confused about the fact that sometimes, like, my guy friends would have boy only parties, and I felt like-- that I was one of them, and so it was strange to me, and I definitely had to kind of figure that out. But when I entered high school and was part of our GSA and things, and I finally was kind of hearing the word "trans," everything kind of clicked. I actually think I had an interesting way of coming out to the school though, because after Irene hit and the school didn'’t have the computer systems running, and when I went to class for the first few days, my teachers were calling me "he" because they didn'’t have my records on file, like in the computer. So when I had a friend try and correct them politely, I waved them down and said, "No, this is--" It seemed faded, I wasn'’t sure if I was gonna come out in my junior year of high school. There were times I just didn'’t believe it, really. I thought--I didn'’t really know if this was something he really felt, or was it teenage nonsense? But as time went on, I decided that I would absolutely go forward and research it and try to understand it. I quickly, though, realized just through my own life experiences, whatever, that it really-- it doesn'’t matter. And I was more anxious to help him figure this out. I kept my feelings private for a long time, like my conflict with it, '’cause you don't want to let go of your little girl. However, I didn'’t want to lose him totally as a child, so I decided that I'’m just gonna go with it, embrace it and just love him no matter what. Oh, one, two, three, one, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Young transgender people can face tremendous difficulty simply being who they are. For every great story that we'’re starting to see about supportive parents who are helping their children through the difficult terrain of gender transition, there are 100 stories of parents who are not helping their children in that way, who are making it extremely difficult for their children. So transgender young people face a unique set of challenges that adults don'’t face, necessarily. Well, I got a life, girl. Well, since I was little, I was on and off with my grandma and my aunt, I used to live with them. My mom used to just drop us off, like, in the house all the time and kind of-- she wasn'’t really involved in our lives. I'’m the youngest, there'’s my sister, and I have two older brothers. My brother was not right in the head. We used to deal with all of that crazy nonsense. And it got to the point where, you know, I wanted to, like, start seeing my father. My father wasn'’t really in my life. So one time I ran away '’cause I was in my grandmother'’s house again and I was tired of being there, being forced to go to church, do things I didn'’t want to do, just things that I-- I just wanted to be myself. So I ran away to my father, I was with my father for a little while, I came out of the closet to him, and then he started treating me differently, and he told me that he didn'’t want a girl. He wanted a boy and that basically, he saw me like as a disgrace. He wasn'’t even trying to talk to me, I mean, I was crying, and I was just kind of like, wow. Like, how can you treat somebody like just because of how they feel, you can'’t like-- it was fucked up, you know? ♪ I had nowhere to go, so I was homeless in the street. I had suitcases of stuff, asking people in school all the time, you know, "Can I have somewhere to live?" You know, like I used to try to stay up all night because--or party all night, then I won'’t look like a bum, you know, in the park. I didn'’t have nowhere to go. Being homeless as a teenager is so frightening, and demoralizing, and humiliating. The physical aspects of being exhausted, of having to ride the trains to sleep at night, of having to put your life in danger by getting into cars with strange guys to meet their sexual needs. Just the physical experience of being a homeless youth is horrific. But I think that what is the hardest is what it means for a young person to not be loved. Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. I struggle with depression, but the more feminine that I look, the better I feel. So I knew where the depression was coming from. That'’s why I had to transition. And unfortunately, a lot of girls are not here today '’cause they committed suicide. That was one of my goals, but I knew that I wanted to be a model, an actress, and a wrestler. Every time when I say wrestler, people go, "A wrestler?" Yes, a wrestler, I was raised on wrestling, and I want to be a wrestler. [indistinct conversations] -Okay, thank you. -Is that okay? 22, I decided to transition. I was living with my mother down south. I left and came back to New York. I took the Amtrak train to the city, and I went to a Drop-In Center with all of my belongings. A Drop-In Center, okay. I stayed there almost three months because I was scared to go anywhere else. And from there, I officially went into the shelter system, '’cause the Drop-In Center is just where you go to sleep, but the shelter actually finds you housing. That was the only option I had because that'’s the only way I can live on my own. I was not going to stay with my family. My family, they don'’t know Olivia yet. They don'’t know her yet. So I said, "Well, let me transition first. Once I'’m comfortable with my body, then I'’ll introduce myself as Olivia to my family." But I did not want to go with them because I didn'’t want them trying to dissuade me from being Olivia, because no matter how-- I don'’t care if I wear men'’s clothes. It'’s not gonna change my heart. It'’s not gonna change how I think. Exhale. It'’s often said that the opposite of love is fear, and I think that if a person is presenting themselves in a way that'’s not easily categorized for us, then it becomes easy to kind of just go, "Ew, like that'’s not for me," or whatever that is. "I don'’t understand that, so that expression of humanity makes me a little uncomfortable." So we must, as a community, become much more comfortable with a pretty high degree of ambiguity because the truth is, no one is easily categorized. Right down the barrel of the lens. Just think in your head, "Everything'’s gonna be okay." Um, I'’m just gonna sing this song I just wrote. Um, the tune, I got the tune, '’cause I don't wanna lose this tune, so yeah, okay. It'’s called-- what am I gonna call it? I think I'’m gonna call it, Tears Hold An Ocean. Okay. ♪ If I saved the tears I'’ve shed for you then maybe I'’ll be able to swim to you ♪ ♪ '’Cause you have created an ocean ♪ ♪ Missing my tempered emotions ♪ ♪ One drop, two drops ♪ Three drops, and a river flows ♪ ♪ It is not so easy to let you know ♪ ♪ My tears hold an ocean I remember when I was 15, I wasn'’t as passable as I am now because of hormone therapy and everything else. Like, I was always feminine, but I still looked very androgynous and people knew I was a boy. And I remember I was walking down the street, and then people starting throwing eggs at me, like, from out the window on one of the buildings in the Bronx. And I was, you know, I was hood, I was like, "Bitch, come downstairs, like, who threw the eggs at me?" Whatever, and nobody wanted to come upstairs, but I was humiliated, I'’ve been through a lot. I'’ve been to eight different, like, high schools. It'’s because I started, like, not focusing in school. I was doing drugs, like all my friends, popping E pills every single day and I was fighting. There were things that, I guess, you know-- everything I'’ve been through in my life, it kind of made me that kind of, I guess, bitter person and I felt like I had to prove myself and I had to really, you know, go hard and not let anybody disrespect me. That'’s when ACS got involved, and everybody was so curious to know where I was at. ♪ My tears hold an ocean Once I got into the group home, it was a total 360. They allowed me to be who I am today, and I had to learn that, you know, I could create family through friends and people that really support me and love me, genuinely, you know, that are around me. I mean, I just learned to cope, but you know, I had my moments where I wanted to give up and I was just like, "Wow, I'’m really on my own." Are you coming tonight? -Where? -My stand-up. -Oh, yeah. -Yeah? Yeah, do you want me to be there? Do you want me to hear it? Um, I think it'’s okay, it'’s not too dirty. I do stand-up comedy locally, as well as in the city, and I think that was the best thing for my town to accept me, was that I could poke fun at my entire transition of when it came to the bathroom changes, and when it came to my family accepting it. And I'’m trying to understand all the social media and stuff, and my little brother knows it so much better than I do already, he'’s 10, but he'’s very confused about my situation. When we'’re wrestling around-- he was too young when I came out as trans, but when we'’re wrestling around, he'’ll hit me in the crotch and he'’ll go, "Haha, I got you in the balls." And I'’ll be like, "Oh, yes you did!" His comedy, sometimes it'’s funny, sometimes it'’s not, but that was more--that was almost as shocking to me that he wanted to be a stand-up comedian. I was like, "What? That'’s, like, bold." You know, I just never-- he was always a funny kid, but that'’s different than being a comedian standing up and talking in front of people. I think it'’s amazing, it'’s just amazing, and he practices his routine with me. And what I don'’t like is that sometimes things that happen in the house become comedy for everybody to laugh at downtown. Oh, by the way, my mother'’s here. She'’s the one who said, "That'’s gross." There we go. I understand that people can be uncomfortable. And at first, I definitely was uncomfortable with talking about it or anything, but I was realizing that when I was able to open up to people who weren'’t getting it, and being able to educate them, and doing so with laughter and humor, it made it a million times better. I'’m adopted. -Are you really? -Yes. You don'’t tell me things. I say that a lot. I mean, I always poke fun at the fact that my parents spent 20 grand adopting a baby girl. ♪ Hi, I'’m Katherine. I am a trans woman, 18 years old, and I'’ve been in transition for exactly 10 months today. I don'’t ever really realize changes, '’cause I'm always looking at the same face every day and it'’s really gradual. But, like, I'’ve noticed-- well, definitely my hair, my body has filled out and it'’s been to the point where depending on what I'’m wearing, people can'’t recognize what gender I am. And that'’s also a good-- well, that'’s a great thing for me, personally, at least to know that I'’ve actually come this far in my transition. But then it also makes me nervous at times '’cause it's just anxiety provoking '’cause people will tend to not react kindly to things they don'’t really understand. Hi, that'’s my mom. Are you allowed to ask her about what she thinks about your.. [speaking in foreign language] She said she doesn'’t know what to say and that since I'’m gonna do what I'’m gonna do, I'’m just gonna do it. That'’s exactly what she said. I didn'’t tell her about choosing the name Katherine. She knows that I want to be a woman and everything, but I don'’t know. She'’s sort of leaning towards trying to understand, at least more than my father and anyone else. I can feel this sort of, like, "What is he doing?" sort of feeling '’cause I feel like they always just assume he or whatever, and it'’s just like, I just appear completely different than they are used to. [speaking foreign language] Well, she'’s saying, like, if I can only sort of survive if I become a woman, then I have to-- then I will do that, but she'’s just saying that she would rather have me as her son and that she can'’t really abandon me, sort of. But, it'’s just once I have, like, my own income and everything, she wants me to actually get like, my own home and everything. What she'’s really worried about is if I stay a woman and, like, keep ties with the family, how the family would react to me. She doesn'’t know what, like, what they would do or anything. How do you feel? I, I don'’t know. It'’s kind of-- '’cause we've never talked like this before and it'’s weird. I feel sort of okay, '’cause it kind of seems more like she'’s just scared for how others will react to me, rather than just me completely becoming someone new. So, but if you leave, will that be it? Or will she stay in touch with you? [speaking foreign language] She said she will definitely talk to me, even if I'’m gone. [speaking foreign language] And she'’s asking if I leave, where would I go? [speaking foreign language] But she'’s just urging me to continue my education first. ♪ Every two weeks, I come to the city for my testosterone injections basically to prevent my estrogen from continuing, and there'’s definitely side effects. You know, there'’s ragey moments and as of this month, lately I lost my period. I no longer get that monthly. Just going through the process of basically what'’s similar to a 15-year-old boy'’s process through puberty. How have you been feeling, what are you noticing? Um, I'’ve been feeling good. I think I'’m adapting well to, to all the changes emotionally and everything. I'’m getting used to it, and I mean, I'’m almost half a year now, I started in January. My job is to make sure that somebody can transition safely, that there are no health issues, no problems that are going to be exacerbated by the introduction of testosterone in the case of Sean, and monitoring their progress through labs, et cetera. It'’s a matter of sometimes having a conversation of what it is to become an adolescent male, in his case, and what to expect and what'’s normal. And changes that are appreciated or not quite appreciated? My voice has seemed to steady out while I'’m speaking. However, not so much when I sing in the car and stuff. I try too much as if I can still hit the notes that I used to. -The high notes, right? -Yeah. Yeah, so do you remember the changes that we talked about, in terms of your musculature, and vocal cords are muscles, right? So they'’ll be changing and developing. You need to get used to singing differently now. Yeah, yeah, I'’m definitely-- I feel like I'’m getting a little more broad. My clothes seem to feel that way as well. But I'’m doing good -in those areas. -Excellent. The timeline is also extremely important '’cause a lot of times, you'’ve been waiting all your life to feel that you'’re developing the correct way, and you finally get to the point where you'’re introducing those hormones into your body to actually help you achieve that, and it'’s management of that anticipation. After four months, I'’ve already started developing a little bit of chin fuzz, and some sideburns, sort of peach fuzz going on. My voice has drastically dropped and lowered. As time has gone by, he is a lot more open, and brighter, and happier, and able to interact much more easily with other people. And his performances tend to be going better, according to him. So it'’s, again, one of those opportunities to note when your outer appearance is starting to match what you'’ve been feeling all your life, how much of a whole person someone becomes. Cool, excellent, so I'’ll be seeing you, okay? -Yeah. -Yeah, take care, okay? -You too. -Buh-bye. I just wanted to ask the group what you feel-- why you feel that it'’s important to have a place like the center where you come, and what have you gotten out of coming here? I don'’t know, I use this term a lot, but it'’s like my own little Wonderland because I like Alice In Wonderland a lot '’cause, I don't know. It has to do a lot with my little hidden desires, everything, and it'’s just like anything can happen, and sort of like-- it'’s a small closed room, but it'’s like much more free than I ever am, even when I'’m at home. So this gives you the space to be able to express yourself in a more authentic way? I wouldn'’t get to wear a dress anywhere else, so, yeah, definitely. I feel like this group, for me, is like really special. And before I started coming here, I was like really early on in my transition and I was nervous. I didn'’t know if what I was feeling was real, or if like I was real, or if I was just making stuff up. And then when I came and I met all these people, I didn'’t know people like me before. And so, I realize that what I was feeling was legitimate and like, what I was experiencing-- that there would be a good outcome to this. Like I wouldn'’t be upset forever or whatever. I think the hardest thing for most transgender and gender nonconforming kids is the family support piece, and because these kids all want to feel loved and respected just like any kid from their family of origin. And, you know, when they don'’t feel that, or when they feel not supported by them, then that can be huge. Well, it sounds like we'’re talking a lot about kind of a sense of belonging, and it sounds like a lot of people-- you know, folks feel like this is a place where they can feel like they belong. Are there other areas where people feel like they don'’t belong, and is that-- you know, how has that been a challenge? Well, definitely with my family, and even more recently, '’cause my family just like-- my extended family discovered that I was transgender, and it'’s been sort of busy Hell with like a few people coming by us like, "Why are you doing this, are you insane? Go to the doctor," I'’m like, "I'’ve been to a doctor, everything is perfectly fine." It'’s just like, I don't know. I'’m not that quiet little girl anymore. I will yell back at them now, and, like, nobody expects that from me anymore. I mean, it'’s like, I'’m not accepted, but if they'’re not going to at least try, at least while I'’m still within their lives, then I'’m not gonna just sit back and do absolutely nothing. I can'’t--that's sort of, like, toxic for me now '’cause I've done that for 18 years. I can'’t do that anymore. -Mhm. -Yeah. ♪ I always had it within myself and I always told myself, "You'’re gonna get the surgery one day," not knowing how I'’m gonna pay for it. You know, and for me to have this opportunity to have gotten it without a cent out of my pocket, $37,000 worth of surgery when I was in foster care, thank God, which is a blessing, and ACS paid for it. You know, I got my breasts done. -Oh you did, oh, can I feel it? -Yeah. [laughing] Yeah, so I got vaginoplasty, my breasts done, I got-- you see this scar here? They shaved down my Adam'’s apple, and I got-- like they shaved down the bone between my brow and they took out the layer that makes my, you know, my forehead wrinkle when I raise my brows, and they raised my brows a little bit, then they sewed it back together, they put it back up. So all that, imagine. It was like times a dozen kind of pain, and I was in that bed like this and I was sweating in my back. I was on morphine, like I guess to, you know, reduce my pain, and no lie, it wasn'’t really-- it was reducing my pain, but it started like making me itch all over my body. Like my body didn'’t--it had an allergic reaction to it. So I was totally-- I was like over it. You know what I mean, like, I was pissed. So you know, like I was drugged up, I was in pain. Like the second day, I told the doctor, I was like, "Listen," I was like, "I can'’t do this, I can'’t do this. Can you guys move me, can you guys move me?" They were telling me I couldn'’t move, I couldn'’t sleep on my sides and I couldn'’t sleep like that. I was on my back the whole time and my back felt mad sweaty and nasty, and I was in pain. I started crying and crying, and my caseworker was there with me and I was like, "I'’m about to rip off my breasts. I'’m about to rip off my pussy," I was like, "I can'’t even believe I got the surgery." I was just crying, crying, I didn'’t-- It was so horrifying that I felt like I kind of regretted it. Like, in the beginning I was like, "Oh my gosh, I should'’ve never gotten this surgery. What the fuck am I doing?" I didn'’t think I was gonna survive it. Long story short, I did. Great thing, but you know, it was hard, you know what I mean? I felt depressed, I felt-- I had a lot of low self-esteem. You know, '’cause I felt like I looked ugly. But I don'’t know, just overall, the whole experience was like the craziest thing I ever had to endure physically, mentally, like, that shit was crazy. They cut my dick off, you know what I mean? Like, it is what it is, like, you know what I mean? No, they didn'’t cut it off, they just--they inverted it. So, they sliced it in half, shoot, shoot, invert, whatever. It'’s crazy. Are you happy with the result? Yeah, no, definitely, definitely. So, now I'’m getting back out into the real world, and then eventually I can focus on my career and my music, and all the things I wanna do and share with the world. I have the talent, I have the potential, and I wanna really kill it out there for other trans girls. ♪ Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, yeah ♪ [unintelligible lyrics] ♪ Emotionally, I'’m not doing that great.

And it just didn'’t work out. I kept catching panic attacks. I don'’t know if I told you, Adam. I stopped taking those anti-psychotics. Yeah, they weren'’t working. They were actually making me feel worse. Like more psychotic or? I think so. So I'’ve been doing a lot of investment in certain, you know, careers, and it'’s just not coming through. Maybe because I'’m not focused on my dream goals. That could be a reason. Being an entertainer, and no, I don'’t mean drag queen. When I say entertainer, I mean model, actress, TV host, radio talk show host, red carpet events, an entertainer like that. Not somebody lip-synching to Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston. I also want to try out for America'’s Next Top Model. I'’m gonna keep applying until I get on that show. I think I'’m devoting my energy to the wrong careers.

Yeah, so they can be brought home, which would be great, much easier than coming every two weeks into the city. But, and she'’s getting good at it. The first time was... -Freaked me out. -Painful. She took it and she went... And she'’s like, "So do I go in quickly or do I go in real slow?" And then all of a sudden she takes it and she goes and stops real short with it, and I almost jumped my leg into the needle. She was just trying to mess with me, but it'’s great. It'’s great that she's here and supporting me. But there was a little mishap? Yeah, the needle got stuck in my leg. -It separated from the syringe. -Yeah, it'’s a little freaky. Okay, were you okay though? Yeah, no, physically I was. It was mentally, I just... had a little freak out for a second. -Okay, what'’s the plan? -Fourth time'’s the charm. Yeah, but no. It had been a while since she had done it anyway. Okay, cool, so next time, in two weeks... Yeah, I won'’t have a defective needle next time. Yeah, it was the equipment. -Absolutely. -Always. -It'’s always the equipment. -Cool, okay. All right, well thank you so much. -No, no worries. -All right. I'’ll see you soon. Hey, your nails aren'’t done this time. Yeah, they will be next time. All right, sounds great. -I look forward to it. -Take care. -You too. -Thank you. Wah-wah. I failed for the third time. Well, it was the needle'’s fault. It separated from the syringe. After I stabbed it in his leg and tried to inject it, it just kind of snapped apart and the medicine spilled all over his leg.

It'’s not as bad as, you know, as it appeared to be before. It'’s all just, you know, it'’s a process. It'’s a healing process. It just...shit takes time, and I'’m impatient, and I just feel like, I just want everything to be perfect already.

Out of all the things I'’m going through right now with having to take care of, you know, my vagina, and dilation, and, you know, you need to dedicate so much time to it, so much time that you start losing your own social life. You start losing-- you can'’t really live your normal life like you want to, you know what I mean? I feel like I started to kind of just rush things and kind of I started to go back out into the real world, and I started not taking care of her. "Her," my vagina. I haven'’t, like, as I was supposed to with, like, dilation, et cetera, et cetera. For a moment, you know, me and my surgeon thought I was closing up. Thank God it'’s okay now, but yeah, I just gotta know that it'’s something you have to be on top of and it has to be priority. Like, dilation is something you have to do for the rest of your life. Morgin'’s very blessed in that she'’s very beautiful and needed very little work to make her look very feminine. Other people are not so blessed. The irony of it is that the bottom surgeries for the males to females are pretty much spot on. I'’ve had patients go to gynecologists who said that they couldn'’t tell the difference between that vagina and a cisgender, or a natal vagina. The phallus is very difficult to recreate because the penis is a very intricate part of the anatomy. And I think that as far as the medical recreation of that, we'’re not quite there yet. So, she said I'’m fine, she said I'’m perfectly fine. She said it looks much better than it was before. The other doctor said that my vagina looks better than hers. There is a huge connection, and when I say when the body finally touches the soul, I can see, and my entire staff can see, the change in the individuals. There'’s a calmness, there'’s a euphoria.

And I'’ve been lucky enough to be their niche. I'’m becoming their guy, so I am happy to hopefully become their front person. I'’m happy to be their poster child. I will have a show this coming summer at Gotham. The more I can connect myself, and at least make these people know I exist, and then get into these clubs, the better. The fact that I'’m gonna be one of the only people who'’s under 21 that'’s performed at Gotham this summer is fantastic.

And I think out of that, well, it was first my boyfriend, who sort of, like, says it'’s similar to Stockholm syndrome, where I sort of care about my sort of abusers.

Sometimes I have, I don'’t want to use the word "doubts." Sometimes I feel like I should'’ve thought this out a little longer, just a little longer, you know. I came out to myself at 20, already started doing this at 22. I just think that was too fast. Maybe that was too fast, you know. No, I don'’t regret it, and I'’m a woman regardless.

So I don'’t want to stop transitioning. Like some of the girls, they are what you call non-transitioning, where they just throw a wig on and that'’s it. But see, life is harder like that. Basically, you generate a disturbance when you don'’t look "the part," when you don'’t look like your perceived gender, you kind of bring unwanted attention to yourself. So, a lot of us girls, we turn to medication to avoid that negative attention. I'’m still getting it, with or without the medication, so what is the point of me keep, you know, having a doctor stab me with that dagger every two weeks? I'’m not seeing, you know, a whole lot of results. I'’m not seeing a drastic change. And my doctor, he don'’t see it either. I don'’t care how many times he tries to, like, beat around the bush, '’cause he'll ask me, "Olivia, have you noticed any changes in you?" And I'’ll tell him bluntly, "No." And then he'’ll give me that deer-in-the headlights look, and I give it to him right back. So now, in a few months we'’re gonna try a different medication. After this, I'’m not sticking no more medicine in my body. I'’m not doing it no more now, you know?

I just turned 22, but I'’m not necessarily where I want to be in my life. And I guess that'’s okay, but it can be, you know, emotionally stressful and, you know, my hormones, being on the hormones that I'’m on, you know, it could fluctuate a little bit of my emotions, well, make me a little bit more emotional than I already am. There'’s days I feel fuckin'’ beautiful and I'’m on top of the world, like everybody else does.

And I'’m not the only woman in the trans experience that goes through this, you know? And I'’m post-op, like, you know, I'’m fully surged, and it still, it doesn'’t mean shit. You know what I mean? It doesn'’t mean nothing. You know, that surgery that I did was for me, for my own closure and my own confidence. And I feel like it didn'’t have to do with anything, you know, decreasing later on as in my confidence level or my insecurities decreasing or whatnot, like not at all. I still go through shit, I still think, you know, negative shit about myself sometimes or whatever. I think everybody does, you'’re your own worst critic.

It'’s crazy. Why would I ever even think that way? But, you know, life'’s not that easy. Um, but yeah. Whatever. Mama? -Mama. -Hmm? [speaking foreign language] I have completed, like, a full year of hormones and everything, but lately, because of depression and everything, I haven'’t been able to, like, really get up and get out of bed. I guess I'’m so depressed with, like, not being able to completely be me, not being able to safely be me, and not being able to be loved as me to the fact where I just don'’t want to be in this reality, so I'’d just rather dream all night. I sort of feel like sometimes I become, like, two different people, one who can rationally understand that my family care, and then it'’s like, I guess, they sort of do feel like they'’ve lost their son and everything. But then, there'’s also just, like, I guess, the part of me that'’s always been Katherine that'’s like, I don'’t know, I just kind of... I guess I just want my mom. I don'’t know if that'’s weird to say, but, like, that'’s literally the first thought I have. Like, it'’s just her, and then I just kind of end up feeling like, I guess an orphan '’cause... she won'’t really acknowledge me as Katherine. It'’s like I really always have wanted, like, a sort of mother-daughter relationship. And growing up, she'’s always talked about how she'’s wanted a daughter, and, like, always just in my head, I was just like, I...

But, there are resources out there for them, and kids who are in school should be looking for things like LGBT alliances in their schools. They should be looking for organizations like ours that can provide them the advice and counseling that they need. When I was 16, I came to PrideWorks and I really made a lot of connections, and there was a lot of assistance and guidance in gearing me as to where I should go to progress when it comes to my transition. And I'’m really proud to come back as a presenter and talk to a similar group of kids. Where I come from, there'’s not a lot of LGBTQ people, so there'’s not a lot of visibility, and that creates, I think, like a lot of confusion. It gets kind of uncomfortable sometimes, and, like, it feels like almost isolated. '’Cause this workshop's titled "Out And Proud: Becoming Comfortable," and I really do want to help and inform as to what schools should be doing or can be doing that they might not be. I genuinely spoke to the kids, asked them what they are having difficulties with in their school system as to making it a comfortable environment. And I wanted to open by saying, "Hey, we'’re not the first ones to do this. We'’re just the first ones finally breaking through and making progress and change." It was nice to meet all of you. Have a wonderful time in session three. I think there'’s a way that the trans youth, that I work with at least, are sort of at the forefront doing the work on expanding ideas about gender for everyone. We'’re all kind of stuck in boxes. So, I guess sometimes I feel really down about what people have to go through, their safety concerns, and I worry sometimes at night like, "Oh God, is this person gonna be in this kind of situation?" And sometimes I feel so excited by the steps that people take. I just feel really, really grateful that they'’re willing to take the risks that they'’re taking and live the lives that they'’re living, '’cause I think it is expanding all of us. We were able to help Imtiaz so that today, Imtiaz is Katherine. Katherine'’s better. [applause] I imagine that maybe within a year or so, you know, Katherine would be more comfortable with calling herself Katherine. It was just amazing how quickly she blossomed once she knew that there was places to go, and that there were people who would accept her for who she was, and it really was faster than I could'’ve ever imagined. Now I tell her story to others, and they hear it, and then I have other students who have since come out to me, not other transgender students, but I have students who have come out to me, and it just continues the cycle of people finding a safe space and, you know, a place to go. There'’s no price. Like, you can'’t put a price on that. It'’s amazing. So, this is an excerpt from a children'’s story, called the Velveteen Rabbit, and it'’s about being real. And I guess for me, it relates to me a lot because when I was a student here as Imtiaz, I really didn'’t feel real. And now I'’m Katherine, and I'’m real, and I'’m out about in the world. So I will begin. "Real isn'’t how you are made," said the skin horse. "It'’s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but really loves you, then you become real." Trans kids risk everything they have in order to be who they are, to live who they are in the world, and there aren'’t very many people in the world who are willing to risk everything to live their truth, and I get to see it every single day, and it inspires me. Everybody give a round of applause for Sean Jahn, everybody, Sean Jahn! [applause] Thank you. Hey, guys. Hey, so I'’m really glad that it'’s a young crowd this time. I'’m almost 20. I'’m also transgendered, as well. Yeah, two in one room, guys. [applause] Now, my family'’s pretty good about it. My little brother, he'’s okay. He'’s trying to understand. We sat him down for the Jenner interviews and everything. Everybody asks me about it, I'’m not talking about it. No, but he'’s really funny. He'’s trying to understand it. And he'’s trying to understand how... Well, you know, like he still gets really mad at me and when he'’s frustrated, he yells, he'’s like, "I wish I had a sister again!" And then all of his friends look around really sad because it sounds like somebody died. Doesn'’t that? It sounds like somebody died, but it'’s really, it's okay. He'’s figuring it out. And so, but one day, he was really mad in the kitchen with my mom fighting, and I walk in at the wrong moment, and he'’s just rambling, yelling whatever, and he yells to me and he'’s like, "And you know what? You know what? Sean'’s gay!" And my mom responded, like, a textbook answer. She'’s like, "How'’s that an insult?" And really, I looked at my mom like, what fucking documentary did you watch? Brilliant! But he looked and he was just, he got confused for a second. And he was like, I don'’t really know, like... And so later on, we'’re telling my father a story. He'’s a little less accepting, but he'’s great. And we'’re telling him and he'’s like, "Oh, no. He doesn'’t even know what gay means." And all of a sudden, my brother just slams his hand on the table and he goes, "Hey! I know what it means! I watch Modern Family!" Tonight started good. It started with a solid feeling of about to throw up, and it ended phenomenally with just such... Like, just being up there is such a breath of fresh air, and to know that your words... I mean especially when they'’re your own written words.

And as difficult as the road can seem on a day-to-day basis, we are moving in a direction towards greater freedom, and these kids and their families should hang on and press forward because they'’re doing the right thing, and they'’re blazing a trail that is going to change the world. I think that we, as human beings, our most profound need is love, to be loved and to love. And to get the message that who you are, that somehow, you know, your gender identity or your sexual orientation makes you unworthy of being loved is devastating. As we recognize that we have a huge number of trans people within our population, as more and more trans people are public and outspoken, as more and more people, instead of simply living in a different gender from the one to which they were born, identify as trans and talk about being trans, I think that brings about a radical transformation in itself. And at the moment, I meet many people who say, "I'’ve never met a trans person." And I think you have, you just didn'’t know. And they say, "I'’ve never seen anything about a trans person." And I think, well, there'’s some out there and you should look for it. But if there gets to be so much out there that they can'’t miss it, and so many people who are publicly trans that no one can say they don'’t know a trans person, then it will change because it'’s very hard to hate anyone whose story you know. ♪ But why you frontin'’? ♪ ♪ If you like what you see, boy, just say something ♪ ♪ Do you have an excuse? ♪ What is there to lose? ♪ In the meantime, baby, you just have to choose ♪ -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ I dare you to come close to me ♪ ♪ And then feel my pulse, yeah ♪ ♪ Truth or dare ♪ Don'’t play shy, show me how a boy can lead ♪ ♪ I see your curiosity ♪ Truth or dare ♪ Ooh ♪ Truth, truth, truth, dare, dare, dare ♪ ♪ Still sitting in the corner feeling like I'’m in the middle ♪ ♪ He looks my way, I'’m feeling butterflies a little ♪ ♪ He'’s in all black, ugh, but I'’m looking like a Skittle ♪ ♪ Opposites attract, and now he'’s giving me a signal ♪ ♪ I just smiled, and now he'’s looking, cuz ♪ ♪ I think he likes the view, and now he'’s mine too ♪ ♪ And must I mention he'’s [unintelligible] ♪ ♪ It'’s like Michael on a train looking [unintelligible] ♪ ♪ And I can dig it ♪ And I'’m thinking ♪ ♪ But why you frontin'’? ♪ ♪ Why you frontin'’? ♪ ♪ If you like what you see, boy, just say something ♪ ♪ Do you have an excuse? ♪ What is there to lose? ♪ What is there to lose? ♪ In the meantime, baby ♪ You just have to choose -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ Don'’t you pick the truth, you know ♪ ♪ The truth is I want you, yeah ♪ -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ I dare you to come close to me ♪ ♪ And then feel my pulse, yeah ♪ -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ Don'’t play shy, show me how a boy can lead ♪ ♪ I see your curiosity ♪ Truth or dare ♪ Truth, truth, truth, dare, dare, dare ♪ ♪ Truth, truth, truth, dare, dare, dare ♪ ♪ Let'’s just make it happen ♪ ♪ I'’m the main attraction ♪ ♪ Show me your reaction ♪ Put me up against the wall ♪ ♪ Let'’s just make it happen ♪ ♪ I'’m the main attraction ♪ ♪ Show me your reaction ♪ Tell me that you'’re worth it all ♪ ♪ Dominate me, I like them tall ♪ ♪ Levitate me, don'’t let me fall ♪ ♪ We can do it all day, night till dawn ♪ ♪ And I want you here where you belong ♪ -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ Don'’t you pick the truth, you know ♪ ♪ The truth is I want you, yeah ♪ -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ I dare you to come close to me ♪ ♪ And then feel my pulse, yeah ♪ -♪ Truth or dare -♪ D-d-d-d-dare ♪ Don'’t play shy, show me how a boy can lead ♪ ♪ I see your curiosity ♪ Truth or dare ♪ Uh, uh, uh, yeah ♪ Uh, uh, uh, yeah ♪ Uh, uh, uh Mix the chemicals.
