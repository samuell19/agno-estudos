[quiet jungle music] [birds cawing] [clucking] [spanish guitar music] [baby crying] Now, Marina, I want you to tell Mrs. Hernandez duerma? Duerma? Until about an hour or so, and then she'll be fine, all right? Gracias. [speaking spanish] Oh-- oh, no. Tell him thank you, but he can keep his chicken. Just have him get in line. - [speaking spanish] - Gracias. Tambien. Gracias. Who's next? Oh, chicita! You come with me. Are you not feeling well? Huh? Is that what's going on? [coughing] OK. Let's just sit right up here-- OK, well, let's see if I can hear anything. Strong heartbeat. OK, take a deep breath. - Let me see. OK. Oh, I think you're going to be fine. How about you? [coughing] OK. [speaking spanish] Let's see the other one. WOMAN: [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] Take this tray. WOMAN: Eh, LiAnne? Would you please look at Pablo? LIANNE: Yes, I'm coming. Right this way, Pablo. Long day, huh? Si, senorita. Hola. Un momento. GIRL: [speaking spanish] Sit right here. [power dying] Oh, oh, no. [yelling in spanish] Excuse me! The lights? So, what seems to be the problem? [siren wailing] MAN: Here. Over here! Hold on there. What seems to be the problem? Oh. I don't have room for him now. Put him over there. Come on! Move him out! Hey! [loud struggle] Guys! [crying] POLICE OFFICER: Hold him down! Hold him! DOCTOR: I need a little help here! I need help! [monitor flat-lining] Help! You! Right here! Hold on! Strike! [yelling] MAN: Come on. Try to get him into three. WOMAN: Hey, get him to stop moving. We can't give him the shot. DOCTOR: Hold his leg! [alarm bell ring] Gunshot? I'll take him. You-- you with me. You ought to see the duty nurse right now. Go on. What's your name? - Elizabeth. Uh-huh. Just do what you're told, Elizabeth, and you'll be fine. Here we go. [door thuds open] [chatter] Gunshot. Lower thorax. No exit, doctor. DOCTOR: I need lab and radiology. NURSE: Yes, doctor. Set up for chest tubes. Right. Shouldn't we change that IV to haemmacel? Front another line, large pour. Call a trauma surgeon and get me a thoracotomy tray. NURSE: Yes, doctor. Elizabeth, get the tray. DOCTOR: All right, partner. We're going to put you to sleep now. When you wake up, you're going to be all better. It'll be a miracle. [tray shaking] I'm sorry. NURSE: No gloves. You just contaminated the tray. I know, sir. I'm sorry. Get her out of here! Elizabeth, go now! [chatter] Trauma surgeon, OR four. And we're light one body. Send in another student nurse. [baby crying] NURSE (ON RADIO): OK. Cardiac unit 6 to admitted. Code blue. Cardiac unit 6 to admitted. Code blue. [loud thud] NURSE: Make way! Make way! Make way for gurney! We heard. I blew it. You're supposed to blow it. This is humiliation 101, you know? No student, no show graduate without being humbled by an ER doctor. How old are you, Rosie? 22. I have food in my freezer older than you. I have a daughter older than you. [chuckle] So big deal. You're old-- er. The thing is today it was you, but tomorrow it's going to be one of us. I mean, it's all part of them establishing the dominant role of the doctor in medicine. My situation's a little different. It's-- there's people watching me. ROSIE ROMERO: How's that? Let's just say I'm not your average student nurse, OK? Try being the first one in your family to even enter the medical profession. You want to talk about pressure? Look. To hell with it. I mean, thanks to you, we're going to Mexico, right? I'll see you. Mexico. [sigh] [hospital radio] Yeah, well, I'm beginning to think that our little Liz is wound a few turns too tight. [laugh] She needs this more than any of us. You make it sound like a party plan. Well, who says it can't be? Partly. Life's what you make it. Yeah, well, that's not why I'm going. Oh. We know, Jill. But not all of us are studying for Our Lady of Perpetual Dullness. What is that supposed to mean exactly? Forget it. [disgusted sigh] So what are you saying? I don't know how to have fun? - Hey. Hey. It means an afternoon on a beach wouldn't kill any of us, OK? Give it a rest already. Damn right. Look, I know how to have fun! Maybe I should go alone. I know why Elizabeth thinks everyone's watching her. Her ex is a doctor. Some bigwig surgeon. I overheard two residents talking about it. Oh. Wait a minute, Walter Hahn? The heart guy? Yeah, that's him. You've heard of him? Yes. Very, very big deal. No wonder she's so jumpy. [plane starting] RULON BEESLEY: All right. I'm going to try and get this on Daniel's plane, and LiAnne, ask Graham if he packed those larger boxes in my cargo. OK, Ru. Uh, Daniel? No more working in the dark. Good. You're going to destroy your back. Look here. Len shaved off his beard. You be good. You keep the home fires burning. [kiss] And everything else as well. And I'll put out the fire when I get home, all right? [chuckle] Hey! JILL HOUSTON: Now Dennis, I want you to be a big boy while I'm gone, OK? You gonna help Grandma? Be mommy's big boy. Look who's here. FRAN MARKOE: That's what she calls an overnight bag? Hello! Hi. We weren't sure you were coming. I wasn't either. This is my daughter, Danae. This is Rosie and Fran. Hi. I've heard a lot about both of you. You have? Danae's coming with us. She has 15 hours of community service too, so I thought it'd be nice if we could do it together. Are you RN or LVN? Oh, actually, I'm in med school. She's going to be a doctor. ROSIE ROMERO: Mm-hmm. [giggle] Like father, like daughter, huh? What? DANIEL PERRIN: Where's Eddie? He'll be here. You know his flair for last minute entrances. Heads up. RULON BEESLEY: Uh, Daniel? I've got maybe 20 operations tomorrow. They won't be any trouble. Oh, no. Student nurses. They're talking about us. Of course they are. So what do you think they're saying? Oh, no. Student nurses. Keep it down, Sparky. You are awful, Mark! I know, honey. I know. Ladies, ladies, ladies. Welcome. [plane taking off] LEN: Well, there they go. You know, we're losing precious beach time here. Here he is. Eh, Mr. Punctual. Eddie! It's about time. Me? This the nightcar to Paris? Yes. We check the tires, get the windshield, and we'll be on our way. [upbeat guitar music] JILL HOUSTON: So is it going to take all day to get to Mexico? DANIEL PERRIN: No, you'll have time for a late afternoon swim or you can shop at Catamaco. First thing in the morning, we fly upriver to the clinic. LEN: Eddie, do you want me to fly? Do you want me to take over? I've got it. I've got it. You haven't let me take over once since we started. Stop being a pest. LEN: I didn't know you felt that way about me. EDDIE: All right. Oh, wow! Look at that! DANIEL PERRIN: OK, ladies. We have arrived. This is Catamaco. [laughter] No, you splashed me! [giggle] You can say that again! Oh, man! Who do we speak about getting our classes scheduled right here. Here we go. Ah, ladies. Ladies! All right! In our capacity as full-fledged members of the airborne-- airborne relief medicine team, we would like to welcome you with this toast. Indeed. - Here, here. To Mexico! To Mexico! We play hard and we work hard! We don't get paid, but it's perhaps the best work we do! [giggles] Salud! All right. - Salud! Salud! Bottoms up. Turnover. [traffic] OK, Elizabeth. Mexican government declared war on the drug trade. And you think our work is endless. That's the reason we can't fly straight to the clinic. Anyone who flies after dark gets shot down. It's my business here regarding our whereabouts, and it pays to be prepared. I can still take you to the beach. Oh, no. No. It's fine. I'm happy to help. Really? You sure? Yes. OK, then. It's back to customs. Aeropuerto, por favor. DRIVER: SÃ­, senor. [chatter] Life here sweeps you along if you let it. Some people call it chaos, but they're wrong. They just haven't been here long enough. [cattle mooing] Look at these people. They accept life as it is. They live the present each and every day. They seem to find a peace that's completely alien to us. Did I ever mention to you that I know your husband? No. My condolences on the divorce. Well, I'm not sure condolences are the right sentiments, but thank you. You know, this used to be a profession where a couple could age gracefully. Yeah. I think I was born a little too late. [cows mooing] [night sounds] [door close] Well, what we got here? Oh! I hate to tell you, but I am all grown up now and I bring my own band-aids with me. This bag has saved your behind more times than I can remember. So this is a permanent move then, huh? I mean, you brought enough clothes here to open up your own store. I like choices. This. This is perfect. And this is exactly how I always see you. Roses and poetry and beautiful clothes and moonlit nights and the Riviera. If that is a compliment, I thank you. What is it that you're doing? I mean, you've never worked a day in your life, and all of a sudden, you're going out into the jungle and you're going to be a nurse. Haven't we mutilated and buried this subject, Danae? DANAE HAHN: No, not as far as I'm concerned. This is not like doing charity work with the girls over at the Guild. Oh, really? Well, guess what? Neither is-- is putting myself through college. Or leaving your father, for that matter. Just because I lived one way for 22 years doesn't mean I am not capable of doing something else. DANAE HAHN: Well, I know. All I was saying is that you might have no idea what you're getting into. What is the big deal? I'm doing the same thing you are! - No, you're not! - Why? I'm going to be a doctor! Bedpans and spoiled linens, they're not going to be a part of my daily routine. I can't believe this. Danae, you have become a snob. Do you realize that? And you know what? They make the worst kind of doctors. [exhale] What do you think your father and I used to talk about? [scoff] I have no idea. Me. Me. Probably. We talked about medicine. 22 years, we talked about medicine. [sigh] And yes, what I am doing is different, and it scares the hell out of me, but it feels right, Danae. And it's really been a long time in coming for me. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself. Well, sorry, dear, if I'm embarrassing you. DANAE HAHN: No-- Mom! I'm trying to say that-- Is this a discussion you had with your father? DANAE HAHN: No, of course not. Mom, I'm sorry, all right? I'm going out for a while. DANAE HAHN: Now? It's 11:00 at night. [door close] [upbeat jungle music] JILL HOUSTON: What is that? Marijuana. A major export crop. [speaking spanish] [plane overhead] [laughter] LIANNE: It's not funny. It's not funny. EDDIE: What? You got a problem? [chuckles] Eddie, come on. You think we lost them? [chuckles] I didn't think we were trying to lose them. What? Is he trying to tell us something? LEN: I got lost on the freeway. Ah, we're having some kind of fun time. Come on, guys. Stop that. Yeah. He's just trying to tell us that he's the world's greatest pilot. [turbulence] Whoa! Oh, my God. Eddie? Eddie? It wasn't me. It was Len's chair. Oh, shit. Are you OK? Yeah. My back is a little tricky. LIANNE: How long until we land? Another 5 to 10 minutes. [beeping] [grunt] Eddie! God! Eddie, you all right? Eddie! [scream] LEN: Something's wrong! [plane falling] Is this off? No. Ed? [plane falling] [yelling] Come up, Ed! [crashing] Brace yourself! [yelling] [screaming] [crash] [troubled jungle music] DANIEL PERRIN (ON RADIO): We have a downed plane about five miles South of Montepio. Does anyone read me? Can anyone hear me? RULON BEESLEY (ON RADIO): Daniel, I see two army Jeeps headed for the strip. DANIEL PERRIN (ON RADIO): Good. Maybe we're in luck. Senor. Senor. [speaking spanish] Dr. Daniel Perrin, [speaking spanish] la clinica. La clinica-- La Clinica desde de Montepio. Se dice crash. - Cayo. - Cayo! SÃ­! - Cayo donde? Adonde, um, un rio. Rio norte de aqui. SÃ­. Rosie, what's taking so long? [speaking spanish] He says they're headed in the other direction. One man-- un hombre, [speaking spanish].. No, no. [speaking spanish] Something about a drug operation. They might be dying. Senor-- [speaking spanish] Please, help us. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] Lo-- lo siento? SOLDIER: [speaking spanish] I don't think they're going to help. But they have to help! [speaking spanish] DANIEL PERRIN: Soldiers are not going to help us. - What? - You're kidding me. What about outside help? Or the police? DANIEL PERRIN: Take too long. Where the hell is Luis? Then we go ourselves, right? We can't go charging off into the jungle by ourselves. FRAN MARKOE: Why not? RULON BEESLEY: Because we'd get lost. That's why. - So what are you saying? We wait? DANIEL PERRIN: Hold on a second, please everybody! We're not going to go wandering off in the jungle. You get lost out there, you die. JILL HOUSTON: So what do we do? What do we do? We wait for Luis to get us out there. [car horn honking] RULON BEESLEY: Here he is. Daniel, we need to stop at the clinic first and get some supplies. DANIEL PERRIN: Right, Ru. Good idea. - I came as fast as I could. - All right. Thank you, Luis. Elizabeth, you and Rosie, you come with us. The rest of you watch the equipment, we'll send someone as soon as we can. To the clinic, Luis. [door slam] Welcome to Mexico. [ominous music] [baby crying] ROSIE ROMERO: What happened here? We never leave much behind, but this place has been stripped. One IV bag, no date. One tube, one angiocath, a butterfly needle, some gauze, a little bandaging, and no anesthetic. Not even aspirin. I hope their supplies survived the plane crash. Um, I have-- I have a few things I brought. It's just first aid stuff. Nothing much, but I have aspirin. OK. If that's all we have, let's go. [ominous music] [car approaching] A lot of traffic for the middle of the jungle. Are you with the doctors? Yeah. Yeah, we are. They just left with a man named Luis. One of our planes crashed back there. Get in. What do you think? Either get in that thing there with Terrorist Bulibar or we sit here and wait and see what comes out of the jungle next. We go. [car revving] All right! We push! Everybody out! Let's get stuff together now. Come on, push together. All set? Gun it, Luis! [car revving] [grunts] Push! Push! Shit! [car dies] [ominous music] Everybody out. Let's go. [ominous music] Ow! Oh, shoot! Darn it! Oh, man! Where'd he go? He's over there. MAN: [speaking spanish] What? What is it? JOSE: Scavengers. JILL HOUSTON: Oh, my God. JOSE: Stay here. MAN: [speaking spanish] Que paso, amigos? [speaking spanish] What is he saying? I have no idea. [speaking spanish] [gun cock] No problem. It's safe. What was that all about? I asked them to leave. GRAHAM: (WEAK) Oh, God, help. Graham! Graham. Come on. Come on. Can you move? [grunt] I think so. All right. Let's go. Where's LiAnne? I don't know. She's not here. Come on, we got to get you out of here! Come on! [screaming] There's petrol everywhere! That engine could explode any minute! [car revving] Eddie! Hey! See if he has a heart beat. I think he's dead. LEN: He's not dead. [coughing] - Len? Len? He's not dead. Eddie? Eddie? FRAN MARKOE: Let me try. LiAnne! LiAnne? I'm fine. LEN: [yelling] I can't move! It's your shoulder. Dislocated. LEN: [yelling] Eddie! Hurry up in there! You got to get them out! Get us out of here! All right. You get Eddie, I'll get Len. LEN: [groaning] [coughing] [grunting] It's gonna blow. I know, I know! It's gonna blow. I'm going to get you out of here! Len-- Len? You're losing a lot of blood. Uh-- uh-- uh-- LEN: [coughing] Hang on! JILL HOUSTON: [grunting] [yelling] [explosion] [scream] RULON BEESLEY: Oh, no. What was that? Let's go find out. Breathe easy, OK? Over here! Come on! Over here! They're still alive! Run! They're still alive! LEN: [coughing] Ru! See what you can find in the medical supplies! All right. Joe, glad you're here. Doctor. He crushed his foot. I've stopped the bleeding. Uh, he's having trouble breathing, he's in a lot of pain. Shoulder, I think, is dislocated. LEN: [coughing] Capillary refill. That's good. Looks worse than it is. He's not going to lose the foot, that's for sure. Oh, thank God! [yelling] DANIEL PERRIN: Here? LEN: [screaming] Yeah, it's dislocated, all right. Everything else seems normal. How's his pulse? It's just a little fast. DANIEL PERRIN: What's going on here? Uh, he has a wound on his neck. He's-- he's in and out. His leg is hurt. Or, broken. (QUIETLY) My back. What about Graham and LiAnne? Uh, LiAnne's got a blow to the head. She's slightly disoriented. She's having some trouble focusing. And Graham is a lot worse. He's got a possible pelvic fracture and a bladder injury, maybe. Any bleeding? DANAE HAHN: No. No. But he's-- he's untalkative. How did you move him? I-- I-- I dragged him. Well, maybe you shouldn't have. He's got fractures in both legs. He had a couple of broken ribs. Elizabeth, let me have that stethoscope, please. I am getting air pockets. We're going to need braces for both his legs. Now! [whimpering] Unbelievable. DANIEL PERRIN: Eddie? Eddie? Eddie, you've got a punctured lung. We're going to get you out of here just as soon as we possibly can, OK? Stick with us. RULON BEESLEY: Daniel, there's nothing. What wasn't destroyed is gone. You're kidding. Everything? Gone. How is that possible? The scavengers. They were here when we arrived. - Local people? - SÃ­. All right. Maybe we can get it back. Some of it, huh? People would pay a lot for medicine. Even more than marijuana. They let their own doctors die? What about the things in the other two planes? All the medical supplies were on Eddie's plane. You're saying we have absolutely no medicine? All right. What do we do? We get them to the clinic. Call Catamaco, medivac them out of here. A lot of time, a lot of daylight left. All right. Hey, Ru. Keep an eye on Eddie. He's the one I'm really worried about. All right. Edward? Edward, you got a couple of broken ribs poking into your lung here, so we're going to take my back brace and wrap it around you and try and stabilize those ribs, OK? Rosie, I need you to stabilize him here, we'll go under his shoulders and you get yourself on either side. We only got one bag, and they're both losing a lot of blood. BP's 80 over 60. He's lost more blood than I thought. I hope he doesn't go into shock. Maybe we could give it to both of them. We could stabilize Len and then give it to Ed. We trade them off. Do it. ELIZABETH HAHN: OK. Here we go. No. [cough] No, no. [coughing] Eddie first. No, no, no, no. Doctor's orders. What's my BP? I said, what's my blood pressure? 80 over 60. [groan] Oh, God. I'm dying. Hey, nobody's dying here, least of all you. Besides, listen, if you die, I'm pretty sure that program is not going to give us credit. You see me through this, and I'll make sure that you pass. OK. This might hurt a little, Doc. Ow! Joe, vamanos! OK. [ominous music] Cuantos hombres? Un hombre. Un hombre, tres senoritas. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] It's OK now. It's OK. [speaking spanish] Rapido. Gracias. OK. OK, OK. [speaking spanish] Oh, gracias. Where'd you learn Spanish? In the kitchen. I did learn a few things as an affluent housewife. [groans] Ay! Ah! Thought you said your back was just tricky. Oh, I said that? I must have been lying. You must have. Don't let him fall asleep. ELIZABETH HAHN: OK. OK, I need some new splints. Yeah, I'll do it. ELIZABETH HAHN: OK, thanks. I got this one. DANIEL PERRIN: [speaking spanish] First thing we've got to do is reduce the swelling in Ed's leg. All right, I'll take care of it. Listen, Daniel, without my back brace, I'm going to be at a bit of a disadvantage here. For one thing, I can't stand up very long without going into spasm. I know it's horrible timing. I'm sorry, but I'll give you the best I can. Meanwhile, you should call that friend of yours in Catamaco and try to get us out of here. 12 years, first time I've had to call for help. All right. First step, we need to reset this man's legs. And Edward, I don't need to tell you this is going to hurt like the dickens, but it's going to be over in two minutes. [heavy breathing] All right. Elizabeth, you'll do the resetting. Just listen to me, do exactly what I say, and you'll be fine. EDDIE: [screaming] Almost. Almost. We're almost there. Lean in a little more. EDDIE: [screaming] And a sharp one. [crack] [screaming] That's it! That's it! OK, maintain the tension. Wrap it up. Hang in there, Edward. Daniel's getting us out of here soon. You're going to be all right. I need to lie down, so I'm going to be in the next room on the floor. You'll be fine here. If you need me, you can call me. Well, what are we supposed to do now? Keep them stable. With what? Whatever we have. Yeah, well, I got a problem. I just realized I'm in the wrong class. We don't have a lot of choice about that now. What we have, ladies, is a job, whether we like it or not. DANIEL PERRIN: What I'm telling you is that I have seriously injured people here. Right. You mean there's not one plane in all of Catamaco? I'm sorry. Yes, I understand. I understand. Right. Please! Please, yes. That's a good idea. Thank you very much. Thank you. WOMAN (ON PHONE): [speaking spanish] Hello, I'd like the number- por favor, yo quiero hablar con la policia in Catamaco. [gasp] My purse. LiAnne? You all right? Li-- ah! Oh! LiAnne? Where are you going? I lost my purse. Um, OK, uh-- I know where it is. I'm going to get it for you, all right? I want you to come in and lie down. I need my lipstick. OK, I understand. I'll get it for you, OK? Oh, God! What is it? I'm bleeding. Graham's bleeding. What do I do? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Come on. Calm down. Calm down. It's OK. Let's go see. Come on. Well, I think it stopped. GRAHAM: [groan] Feel better? GRAHAM: Yeah. Thank you. JILL HOUSTON: [sigh] Here I thought Fran was the screw up. And I'm dragging Eddie on the ground. Jill, I don't care what he said to you. You had to move him and you did. You're doing fine. I have a job at the VA IN the psychiatric unit. I have been spit on, punched, bitten, tackled. I thought a job like that, I could handle anything. [scoff] Well, I'm not sure any of us were ready for this. I wanted to impress him. Dr. Perrin is the only reason I am here. I could get community service credit anywhere, but I mean, being here, doing this, working with him, it's an opportunity of a lifetime and I blew it. What did you do with the VA? Nothing special. Mostly, I just talk to them. You feel like talking now? Hey, gorgeous. You want to dance? [coughing] Um, do you have-- do you have any kids? Two. Two. I have one little boy. Yeah? Yeah. How old? Three. I have been on the phone with every official in Catamaco. No one has a big enough plane. Are you sure we shouldn't just rip out the seats in our own planes and make do? There still wouldn't be enough room. We need recumbent transport. If we sit them up, how do we sustain their blood pressure? We can't. We'll kill them. Right. They've got to be flat. Well, I'm going to check on Graham. DANIEL PERRIN: Maybe we could try San Diego Air Rescue. [ominous music] We'll be losing the light soon. There's got to be something. My husband used to say there's always some little thing you can do for a patient. DANIEL PERRIN: Was he in the Mexican jungle when he said that? We can't dial 911. - I know. I know. You're the only hope they have, Daniel. So how do we get them out? At this rate, we don't. [troubled jungle music] Senores y senoras, por favor. Escuchame. Lo siento, mucho. Por que hoy, no clinic. No-- no-- no tenemos la clinica. [murmuring] They understood what I said, did they? Yes, they understand. We stay, por favor. You can stay, but-- pero no tenemos medicina. Podemos hacer nada. We can do nothing. [speaking spanish] What did she say? I didn't get all of that. She said, God brought the doctors to help us. Now, they will stay so God will come again and help the doctors. They're right. It's in God's hands now. Gracias. LOIS: What? They can't get air transport into Mexico? No, apparently not. I'm arranging clearance for us right now. They crashed-- they crashed right here in the Sinaloa jungle. I've never heard of it. We'll know soon enough. They got four critical injuries, all stretcher cases. So we're going to need four planes. LOIS: We only have three planes flight ready. Great. OK. Chris will take the jet, bring out the first one, then go back for the last one. You and Pete and the Cessnas will take out numbers 2 and 3. Mexico it is. You got a problem. Doc Wilson is in surgery. They say he won't be free for another two hours. What about Reed? Halfway up Mount Shasta. Some climbers ran into trouble. And Wiley is on vacation. Yeah. Damn. OK, call St. Catherine. See if they have someone on call that they can spare? OK. [phone ringing] Air Rescue? I want that confirmed. Yes, now. Mexican authorities won't issue us a clearance. You're kidding. No flights permitted over Sinaloa after 5:00. There's no exception. There's some drug interdiction thing. OK, that's four hours flying time in the Cessna's? Grounded. LiAnne's right pupil is dilated and she's very disoriented. Are you sure? Well, she just told me she was late for the opera. I think there are significant indications of intracranial swelling due to bleeding. Leave the diagnosing to us, Elizabeth, all right? I'll take a look at it-- I can manage myself. [groan] OK, look this way. All right. Once again, this way. Good. OK. I'm going to check back here for swelling. OK? Yeah. Yeah. OK. All right, LiAnne. Thank you. Well, not a bad diagnosis, I'd say. Unfortunately, the bleeding is causing pressure on her brain and we have to remove that pressure. How? Keep her still, keep her head elevated no more than 30 degrees. Minimum fluids. I want to dehydrate her as much as possible. Dry as we can keep her. I'd put her on Lasix if we had any. I actually might have a couple of diuretic pills. In your bag? You should acquire a patent on that bag. FRAN MARKOE: Doctor? What now? Len's having trouble breathing. OK. DANIEL PERRIN: What do you mean they won't let you fly? You're an air rescue team, aren't you? Yes, sir. Here in Southern California, that's exactly what we are. But you're in Mexico, and Mexican authorities do not want us flying in there after dark. Now, we're still working on it. I'm afraid you and your people may have to last out the night. Sir, I will have casualties here if we are forced to wait for daybreak. I want to make that perfectly clear. I understand. [slams phone] Not now, Elizabeth! - No, I know. I'm sorry. It's Len. His lungs are filling with fluid. He's going into shock. He needs oxygen and blood, and I don't have oxygen and blood! There's not one thing that I can do. I am not a miracle worker! The only thing we can offer them now is compassion, and you're probably a hell of a lot better at that than I am. So why don't you do what you can and I'll sit here by the phone, do what I can. I hope you understand. Yes. [ominous music] MAN: [speaking spanish] Just a little water. You know, I used to be afraid of just about everything? I think that's why I try so hard to be perfect. Len? Len? You are perfect. Well, not according to my ex. Well, honey, he just wasn't good enough for you. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder how something as wonderful as my son could come out something as wrong as my marriage. Len? Len? Call the doctors, please! This man found this in the jungle. He says an angel spoke to him and told him it would cure the sick doctors, so he brought it here. Atropine. Thank you. Make sure you thank him. Muchas gracias, senor! De nada, senorita. Atropine could just as easily kill him, Dan. Come on, Ru. He's going into shock. He's drowning in his own fluid. If his heart can't take the atropine, he'll die anyway! Someone make a decision, please. RULON BEESLEY: All I'm asking you to do is take a minute to think about it. Here! [ominous music] [choking] He's arresting, Daniel. Like hell he is! RULON BEESLEY: Daniel! Undo his pants. Get the pillow out from under his head. Somebody gets the pillow out from under his head, please. DANIEL PERRIN: Come on, come on, come on, come on! Come on! CPR time. RULON BEESLEY: And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5. And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5. And 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Come on. Let's try again. 1, 2, and 3, and 4, and 5. Come back, Eddie! Come on! And 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Huh? He's gone. Damn! [whimpering] No. No. No! You can't do this to me! Nurse. Jill, honey. No! No, no, no! Stop! Nurse, he's gone. You're wrong. RULON BEESLEY: This is not doing him any good. You're wrong! Just let him go. Nurse. JILL HOUSTON: 4, 5. RULON BEESLEY: Nurse. Listen to me. Come on! Come on! Let him go. [gasp] I have a pulse. [coughing] Daniel. Daniel! He's clearing his throat. DANIEL PERRIN: Atta boy! RULON BEESLEY: Heart beat is good. DANIEL PERRIN: Come back to us! Rate? RULON BEESLEY: Getting a good rate. You're a strong lad. [soft music] Miracle or not, we can say thank you. Where are you from? ROSIE ROMERO: Glendale. Well, my father was from Oaxaca. He's a car dealer now. And my mother was born in America. I want to show you something. People who leave their homes and headed North. ROSIE ROMERO: All these people were from here? Here, from the South, from the mountains. All went through this town headed to El Norte. Even if they didn't survive the trip, they knew there was this. My father never talks about his childhood in Mexico or Mother. What father wants to talk about hardship to his daughter? ROSIE ROMERO: Yeah. [boiling] Guess that bag came in handy after all. Uh-huh. Dr. Elaine's pediatric care. Never leave home without it. Actually, that was meant to be an-- that was your daughter's attempt at an apology. I don't know. Sometimes I think one thing in my mouth just says something else-- like last night. I mean, it's a perfect example. I didn't mean to imply that you couldn't do this. But that's how it came out. And I hear myself saying it when I say it, but I just-- I don't know. It's like, it's a problem. And maybe it's just my neurons or something just don't synapse properly. You get that from your father. Why not? I got everything else. Not everything. You got my legs. Poor baby. Mom? I-- I wanted to tell you this this morning. I kind of wished that dad was here, and then I felt bad-- Don't. I felt the same way. You did? Honey, your father's a hell of a doctor. It's the rest of the package I got a problem with. Yeah. Well, I don't feel like that now. You got my smile, too. [soft music] Wow. Yeah. Wow. [ominous music] MAN: [speaking spanish] Vamanos! My advisor told me, just before we came down here, they're thinking about washing me out of the program. I'm not nurse-like enough or something. They don't like my attitude. It's been a problem all my life. Well, I guess you proved them wrong, though, huh? No, they're right. What are you talking about? It's OK. I was only doing it because my mom kept bugging me. You know how that is. [scoff] Drove me nuts. But you're good. You don't have to say that. Fran, if you weren't there, I never would have got Eddie and Len out of the plane. I mean it. It was you. You think so? You're a damn good nurse. [ominous music] [jungle noises] [ominous music] LiAnne! LiAnne! LiAnne! LiAnne! LiAnne! LiAnne! [screaming] [snake hiss] We could eat that. LiAnne! [animal noises] LiAnne? It's beautiful, isn't it? Do I know you? LiAnne, it's Jill. [giggle] I'm thirsty. I-- I know. I know. You had a head. Do you remember? You can't drink. Remember? I don't know what I'm doing here. [crying] Oh. It's OK. OK. Oh. Oh. It's OK. Here we go. DANIEL PERRIN: You leave the Mexican clearance to me. I'll fly to Catamaco and talk to them in person. Just get the planes down here. Doctor, it's not that simple. Even if you could get clearance, I just found out that we can't land in Montepio. What do you mean you can't land here? You've landed here for years. PILOT (ON PHONE): Not in the jet, you haven't. Look, we need at least 5,000 feet of runway for the jet, and as far as I can make out, you barely have 2,000. Well, what about the Cessnas? PILOT (ON PHONE): Doctor, that would mean a night landing in Montepio. Now, if my people knew the field, I'd chance it. Yeah. But no. So now what? So you need to find me a runway. I'll get back to you. Oh, wonderful. ELIZABETH HAHN: It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, honey. Come on. Sit down. Yeah. Look at me. Look right at my face. The important thing is we got her back. Honey? LiAnne? Graham? Oh, good! She recognizes you. Graham, you think you can hold her? Maybe we can keep her still that way. - Yeah. - Yeah? Good. Come on. [soft music] Come on. You go right over here. Here you go. Come on. Lay down. Down you go. That's it, sweetheart. That's it. OK? Everything's going to be all right. [shaky breathing] Everything's going to be all right. El Fuerte. Never heard of it. They have a runway long enough. I have seen jets land there. How long does it take to get there? JOSE: Two hours. Two hours. If the road is clear. Two hours through the jungle. And the mountains. Edward and Len barely survived the first ride. I know that, Ru. 3:30. Got three hours of light left. What if the road is as bad as I think it's going to be? If we get a flat tire-- Ru, what are the odds? Not good. Come on, Ru! I need an opinion. All right. Leonard is in shock. He's critical. We move him, I think we lose him. Edward-- Edward is stable for the moment. We've got his BP up. But Graham? I don't know. Fractured pelvis loses a lot of blood. Maybe a torn urethra. I'm surprised he's not in shock too. LiAnne, no way. There's major intracranial bleeding there. I wouldn't like her chances if there was a trauma center waiting in El Fuerte. What are you saying? That we shouldn't try El Fuerte? I'm saying you move Leonard and LiAnne, we may well lose them. You want me to make a decision? I say-- [sigh] Whatever gets them medical attention first! Daniel, look! We're only doctors. PILOT: So this El Fuerte seems long enough. I think we can make it before dark, or close to it. So should we do it? I haven't decided yet. [soft music] Well, I'd say life certainly has swept us along. This bougainvillea is supposed to grow like a weed. Maybe it's trying to tell me something. Wife and I were on vacation in this part of Mexico 14 years ago, and we decided to create a clinic here. It was closer than Africa and less hostile than Central America. She would come down with me all the time until it became too difficult for her to travel. We worked together side by side. We were a really good team. I miss her. Walt preferred Europe. [chuckle] I didn't know your husband very well. I didn't either. Well, I'm getting to know you. And I got to tell you, I'm really impressed. Thank you. Coming from someone like you, it means a lot to me. This trip to El Fuerte, it's not going to be easy. You just do what you have to do. And we'll do what we have to do. DANIEL PERRIN: All right. You'll all travel in Joe's truck to El Fuerte. He says he can make it in a couple of hours. I'll be flying to Catamaco on one of the pipers. Why are you going to Catamaco? The Mexican authorities will not clear a rescue flight. I'll try to change their minds, but if I can't, I'll fly to El Fuerte with whatever provisions I can carry. At night? No. Tomorrow morning. [sigh] - Rosie. - Yeah? What's going on? I thought the brochure said sun, sea, and sex. Well, I guess we missed the fine print, huh? Listen to you. [laughter] Get it done, girl, huh? I will. They don't know what's about to hit them. [car starts] OK. So we'll see you soon. Party on, girls! Bye! We should hurry. Why? [thunder] It's going to rain. [sigh] Good. [determined music] [rainfall] Here it comes, guys. ELIZABETH HAHN: We got to get her covered up. Here. ELIZABETH HAHN: Here, put this on. Cover her head. I need a poncho or something. Quick, quick. I'm coming. I'm coming. Here. JILL HOUSTON: That's fine. Right here. JILL HOUSTON: Thanks. Thanks. OK. Your mom's really something. ELIZABETH HAHN: Here you go, babe. Yeah, I know. She is. What are you reading? The Bible. Oh, yeah. [tire turning] [trouble music] RULON BEESLEY: Ye, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil. I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thou art with me. Thou art with me. [gunshot] We must be traveling towards the storm. That's not thunder. What is it? Gunfire. [trouble music] MAN: [speaking spanish] [heavy breathing] If it were up to me, I would send whatever aid I had at my disposal. I am a man who knows how to treat my country's friends. But, I am in a predicament. Los gusanos, the drug merchants make it so. Senor, I am truly sorry. I have got to talk to someone. Who would that be? MAN: Excuse me? I went to Mexican air traffic control and they sent me here. They said that you would be able to give me clearance for an air rescue team. They were mistaken. Then who can get me clearance! [ominous music] [car struggling] You have driven this road before, haven't you, Joe? No. Never. But my brother has many times. Uh-huh. You ever flown through Triple-A before? Yep. Small arms. 50 caliber quads. Ground artillery. Sams missiles. I've flown through it. Didn't like it much. Just hope we get that clearance. I'm going. If we don't, they may die. I'm taking Lois. Martin, we are on deck. [ominous music] [groaning] Oh, great. JILL HOUSTON: It's not a problem. We have more. It's-- we probably used most of it on Eddie, though. He's a lot worse off than you are. OK. DANAE HAHN: Mom! The sun's going down. Lay down beside them! We have to keep them warm! How are you doing? Was it my fault? Was what your fault-- oh, you mean the crash? Uh-huh. Oh, I'm not a pilot. I'm not. You're asking the wrong person. I'm not a good pilot. My wife is always after me. She would like me to do a little less flying. Doctors need getting after. [coughing] That sounds just like her. You know, I'm out at work, or I'm just lying down here, or off somewhere, and I realize my wife and I don't see much of each other. Do you still love her? Yeah. Yeah, I love her very much. Well, then I suggest you do something about this not seeing each other stuff at home. Yeah. Well, I was wondering if-- if I don't, would you call my wife for me? I would. Yes. But I'm not going to need to. OK? SÃ­. [speaking spanish] Gracias. Where's your friend? She's getting medical supplies. There's been a development. What's that? We've been informed that an American plane is on its way to El Fuerte. Thank God. I'm afraid nothing has changed, however. I must request that you have them called back. Are you serious? MAN: Yes, I am. We have reports of a gun battle not far from your people. I didn't want to worry you. [intense soft music] You didn't want to worry me? [chuckle] Comandante, you've got to be a man who lives in a big house behind some very high walls. You see my-- my friends have put their trust in me. And above all else, I know how to treat my friends. Just the same, I cannot take responsibility for the safety of this plane! Are you willing to take responsibility for the plane if it's shot down? Because believe me, sir, I will see to it that you are held responsible! Now surely, surely there is someone that you can call. Some way to avoid a senseless tragedy. [speaking spanish] Thank you. Thank you very much. [intense music] [branches breaking] [chuckle] Why are we stopping? El Fuerte. That's El Fuerte? Yes. The runway. [intense music] Joe, if somebody is actually coming down here, how are they going to land? What do you mean, Elizabeth? Well, there's no lights. It's going to be dark here in 10 minutes. That could be a problem. [night sounds] Would anybody happen to know how to drive this thing? Say, uh, say we had to? Joe will be back. He's barely breathing. Jill, you are the only-- the only reason he's alive right now. Don't you dare give up. [plane radio] Roger that, San Diego. Just been assured the army will do their best not to shoot us down. That's reassuring. Well, we should be seeing the lights of their runway any second now. According to this, we should be flying over them right now. All I see is black. [plane overhead] That's got to be them. Hey! Hey! No way anybody's landing in this darkness. - What's that? - Where? There. What the? [mysterious music] What is that? ELIZABETH HAHN: I haven't the faintest idea. Look at that. Woo-hoo! Faster! [hopeful music] That must be them. [chuckle] JILL HOUSTON: All right, Joe! Yeah Strap in for a landing, folks. LOIS: Torchlight. Middle of the jungle. Terrific. That's not the half of it. That runway looks too short. [determined music] He's coming in too high. Too high. Uh-oh! What's wrong? What-- Runway's too short. Oh, my God. Let's go around again. I think I can make it. I'm going to drag her in at 80 knots and plop her down. Warn me when we get below 80. That doesn't give us much room for error. 83. 82. He will make it. 100 feet. 79 knots. Here we go. Come on. Come on, come on. Oh, yes. [soft music] [laughing] ELIZABETH HAHN: Let's get them ready. Who's in charge here? She is. She's in charge. You know what to do, Elizabeth. OK. Yeah, this is LiAnne. Head trauma. You have mannitol? Yeah. Of course. Len's next. Jill? Yeah. His BP is 90 over 60. His pulse is thready. I need plasmanate and oxygen. And be careful moving him. You're going to be all right now. Watch his head. Give me hand, would you? OK. [chatter] [plane takeoff] [soft music]
