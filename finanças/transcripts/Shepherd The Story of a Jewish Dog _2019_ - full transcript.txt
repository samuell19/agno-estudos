- Another one. - Shh, honey. Don't shout at her. - Good girl. - Push Anya, push. That's right, Anya, it's coming out. Look at that little head. Oh, I know it's hard, I know, I know. - The miracle of nature. - Oh, so sweet. What shall we name this one? - Joseph. - Joseph? Can't you see that it's a girl? Don't you even know the difference between a boy and a girl? I said Josephine, didn't I, Mama? Yeah, perhaps you did. There's another one in there. Are you sure, Papa? Of course he's sure, he's a doctor. But not of dogs. Anya, shh, it's not easy, I know. But soon you can rest, good girl. Oh, a little one. - What shall we name... - Him, see it's a him. Yes, I can see it's a him. What about Kaleb? It means dog in Hebrew. Welcome to the world, little Kaleb. Come on, Kaleb, Kaleb. There you go, little Kaleb, delicious. Please don't do that. They're hungry. Come here, Josephine. Don't give the puppies people food, and stop calling their names. It will make you too attached to them. Hello, little Kaleb. Your mother said no names. Hello, little puppy. Mm, you can call them by their numbers instead of names. Hello, number four. We must make plans for the dogs. What kind of plans? Go ahead Shoshonna, explain it to them. We have to find homes for them, they can't all live here. We can't give them away. Maybe not all of them, we can keep one? How can we pick out one? We love them all. We will find good homes for them. They can't be separated. They're brothers and sisters. What if someone told you you had to pick Rachel or me? Would you be able to do that? I don't think that would be a very difficult choice. It's not the same. Even if times were good, we can't have five dogs, including Anya. We're not a kennel. Eat your schnitzel. Are these puppies pure German Shepherd? As far as we know. What is the price for them? We are not asking for money, only good homes. Do you have papers for them? No I am sorry, we don't. Then how do we know if they're pure bred? Karl Gustav here is 100 percent German Rottweiler. Perfect pedigree and pure lineage. - How nice. - There might be some mixed terrier blood, or something French in there. - Of course. - Mama, Mama, look, puppies! I like this one. We are not giving this one away. But that's the one I want. Some of the others are just as nice and bigger. Come, come, Kaleb. There's something wrong with this dog. He's crazy, and he bites little girls. He's bitten my sister several times, hasn't he, Rachel? Yeah, he bit me in the neck and the eye. I had to go to the hospital. Come along, Harriet. Thanks, Rachel. Poor Anya. You stay, Anya. You're not allowed into the bakery. It's only the bakery. And tomorrow it will be the florist, then the seamstress, then the food market. There is danger forming around us. Just try to keep this from the children. Keep it from them? They saw the sign in the window. They understand what is happening better than you do. It will subside, it will have to. And these new Nuremberg Laws, do you know what is written there? It says, "For the protection of German blood and German honor." We are fifth-generation German, our children sixth. Yes, and all of a sudden we are no longer the right breed of Germans. Come in, please, everybody. Good evening, everybody. Happy to see you both, we love it. Hello, sir. Everybody's fine, and welcome. This is Baruch Zonnenfeld, a doctor who went to school with me, and this is the Komorsky family. Hello, how are you? I'm fine, I hope you don't mind that I brought Kugel. Oh this is very nice of you, but we don't eat Kugel on Passover. Uh, Kugel. - Everybody, of course. - Oh, of course, of course. Every creature should celebrate the Festival of Freedom. - Come on. - Oh, thank you. - Come, come, come. - Go on, Kugel. Please, go with Mrs. Sherman. Go to the table. Come on, the table's ready, please everybody. Oh, what a beautiful Seder table. Thank you. The greens are a symbol of spring, and the miracle of nature, and we dip it in the salt water as a symbol to remind us of the tears shed by the oppressed Israelites. We cannot complete the Seder without the middle matzah, the afikomen. Where is it, Kaleb? That's it boy, you found it? - I got it. - Oh no. You are amazing. Come, Joshua, come, I have something for you. Mm, this is interesting. Is this is a new flavor of matzah? Come, Kaleb. - Why aren't they in school? - They were sent home. It's Joshua's fault. Joshua passed note to a girl in his class, Lena Lingmeyer. They said it was a love letter. I wrote that I thought she was pretty. She's the daughter of an SS officer, and therefore it was considered a travesty. The teacher said that Joshua and Rachel will no longer be welcome in the school. I can no longer go to school because Joshua got into trouble. I did nothing, this is not fair. It is time to tell them the truth. - There is no truth. - What is happening? It's just for the time being. And when I go back, will I be in the same class as all my friends? Yes, yes, of course you will. But in the meantime, we will study here. Your father and I will teach you. - Mrs. Matilda Schreiver? - Yeah. Are you here by yourself? Only the children are home. The Nuremberg Law does not permit Jews to employ domestics under the age of 45. The people are not aus Juden. - They are good Jews. - Good Jews? The only good Jews are in Dachau. Listen, you are an Aryan. You clean the floors of Jews. Don't you think you deserve better than this? They treat me very well and this is the work I do. Earning a living is important, but purity of the race is more important. You must leave immediately. We will be back to check that you are no longer working here. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. I am truly, truly sorry that I'm not yet 45 years old. I'm very, very sorry. You have been very kind to me. Thank you for everything. You have been a great part of our family. - You wanted to talk to me? - Let's walk. I'm saying goodbye. Bought a ticket for myself and my dog, getting a train to Italy tomorrow, and from there sailing to Palestine. You of course heard of the latest prohibition. No. Jews are no longer able to own pets. This dog is all I have, I have no family. What are you waiting for, Samuel? Get out before it's too late. I don't think there's a need to be overly dramatic. This time there is. We won't be able to find someone to take both of them. Perhaps Matilda can take Anya, and we find someone else for Kaleb. It is so good to see you, Matilda. - Do you remember my husband? - Yes, yes of course. - Gabriel. - Of course. Nice-looking dog. I told you so, and she's very obedient. Watch, sit. Do you think you can take Kaleb also? No, just one dog. - You'd better be going. - Yes. This is her food and... this is her favorite blanket. - Go on. - Come, Anya. Go, go, go. No, stay Kaleb. He misses his mother. Why did Matilda take Anya? I don't understand. When bad people make rules for other people, no good can ever come out of it. Is this also because we are Jewish? - Yes. - Then let's not be Jewish. Let's become Catholic, and we can keep and have everything that everybody else has. We are Jewish, and be grateful you have a wonderful family, don't ever forget that. Should we have some chocolates? Really, Mama, we can have chocolate? Yes, one. - Good afternoon, Dr. Sherman. - Please, come in. I'm Frank Heinz and was told by your patient, Alda, that... Yes, yes, yes, please. Thank you, please. - Will they still let us in? - Yes, yes. - One chocolate, please. - Hello, hello. Do you want some chocolate? - Yes. - Thank you. You'll find that Kaleb is an unusual dog, very smart. But if everything's all right, perhaps you should leave before the children come home. Are they not in school? Auf Wiedersehen, our beloved little pup. Frank and his wife will take good care of you. May the Lord bless thee and keep thee, and may his grace shine upon thee, and be gracious with thee for all the days your life. Come Kaleb, Kaleb. Come on, come. - We had chocolate. - I saved you a piece, Papa. Kaleb, Kaleb. Why wasn't Kaleb at the door? What is it? So Joshua, you have to be strong. We had to give Kaleb away. We could do nothing, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, he cannot come home. No! Why? No. Kaleb, Kaleb, come out now, come on. Now, it's all right. Okay, come, come upstairs. Here is your new home, I'll show you. Come, come. I brought you a surprise. Do you remember what my father said when I told him that we were getting married? I assume this is a rhetorical question. He said, "Frank is a nice man, but he does things without thinking." When I brought Norbert, you were not excited at first. That's not true, I loved Norbert from the minute I saw him. Where did you get this dog? From the Sherman family. How could you have thought that a dog from Jews could replace Norbert? What in the world do you call this thing? - Kaleb. - What a stupid name. A name can be changed, how about we call him Norbert? The water in Norbert's bowl is still clear, and you want to give his name to a Jewish dog? What's wrong with you? Let me think of a new name. How about Wilhelm, it sounds good. Greta, Frank, and the Wilhelm Heinz. I don't want this dog. Either you return him to where you got him, or you take care of him all by yourself. Frank, can you hurry up, we're late. Back in your place. - We'll return soon. - What a dreadful dog. I don't understand it. He was so lively at the Shermans'. Perhaps he only likes Jews. Let's go Frank. Look what I got for you at the butcher. Here you go boy, it's all right. Frank, let's go. And whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous. As Jesus said, "What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?" Go in peace. Do you think that because Jesus was so light of weight, he was able to walk on water? Not like me, where there's my bowel. You would've drowned in a second. Mm. Well, the priest is a good speaker, I think. The priest was nice. Darling, let's have a cup of tea. Oh mein Gott, do you see what he did? You idiot, you idiot! You stupid, bad dog. Wilhelm. Boy, I can't imagine why you returned. You know how many times I've thought of doing what you did? My life is hell. Just as you live out of my hand, that's the way I live out of hers. I wasn't able to make much of myself in this life. That's okay, boy, it'll be all right. Careful please. This way. Careful. Right there. Good, take that. If you do anything to this chair, I'll have you killed. Hey, lady, your dog. - Who's dog is this? - Hey you, stop. Where is he going? He seems to know his way around here. Do you think it is possible he used to live here? Well, he does not live here now. - Don't touch him. - Get out. Come here, you bad dog. I said come here. He seems hungry. That is not our problem. I'll go and see if there's something in the garbage. Don't you do that. Quiet, you. Look what I have for you, hungry dog. Come on, come on. Come here, come on, come on. Look, look, okay go. Peter, you are not going to believe this. - Look at that. - Go away, go home. You really must leave us alone now. Look at this dog, he's following us. Can we take him home? Don't go near him, he's a street dog. He could have rabies. Leave me alone. Good morning, number 120. You are a handsome dog. Have the drugs worn off yet? Soon Dr. Plechtner will be here. He is the regional veterinarian, and you want him to select you. When the doctor looks at you, look back at him straight in the eye and growl. The doctor likes you when you have the killer instinct. Right, right, right. Left, right. Oh, left, left. What do we have here? That one's perfect. Right. Calm down. Shh, shh, shh. First, we must find a name for you. Blitz will be your name. Blitz, come here, Blitz. Welcome. This is good for you. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. Curse the bloodsucker. Blitz, my friend, you really needed this bath. Underneath all this filth, we might just find a good-looking dog, huh? Fine, fine, Blitz, fine. Blitz has learned a new trick that you all have not yet seen. Heil Hitler. Achtung! We are here to perform an actual military task. This will be an important test for both you and your dog, now go. This time is for real, Blitz. In here. No no, please. Well done, Blitz, you did an excellent job. Ralph. Is your dog pure German Shepherd? The truth is, I don't really know. They've got him from the pound, but he certainly looks purebred. Your dog found more Jews than all the other dogs put together. Yes, he certainly seems to have a nose for them. Well, keep up the good work with him, and I will promise you a prime assignment at the end of the course. Thank you, sir, thank you very much. What an amazing dog you are, Blitzie. Even before I finish teaching you something, you already know it. Who was I up until now? Just another trainer in life, doggie. But now, even Jurgen Klein knows who I am. Don't you worry, I haven't forgotten for a moment that at least half of the achievement is yours. Ralph Gerstler. On this day of September 13th, Herr Ralph Gerstler has completed the training course to the satisfaction of the Reich, and becomes an official trainer of the SS. And to his dog, Blitz, for his service as well. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. All right. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Things run beautifully here at this work camp. That means that each person knows his job well, so that all I have to do is supervise from a distance. At night I can sleep well, because I have a good staff that I can rely on. I hope that all of you newcomers will uphold the level of our excellence. Ralph, I want to talk to you about something. Your dog against mine, the stinking Ukrainians would pay good money to see a dog fight. What do you say? No, that's not what I trained him for. Blitz is not a dog for dog fights, and the money of the Ukrainians doesn't interest me. "The money of the Ukrainians doesn't interest me." Money interests all of us. Sometimes I think if we compare the qualities of man to the qualities of dogs, the dogs would easily win. What are you talking about? We insist on making war even after we sniffed each other. We are not content with pissing on someone's territory. We have to conquer it. But we don't crap in the middle of the street. Ah yes, I guess for that we can be admired. Oh Blitzie, what would I do here without you? I swear you the most human creature in this whole place. Out, out, hurry up. Come on, keep moving. Hurry up. Out. Silence. You will be divided into groups for work. All males go to the right, women to the left. Women will be sent a nearby work camp. If you want to see something, just let me know. Don't dislocate my shoulder, just ask. - Mommy, no, Mommy. - Let go, let go. What's the matter, Blitz? Out of the depth, have I cried onto thee, oh Lord, I cried upon the Lord in distress. Rise up Lord and let thine enemies be scattered. - So much praying. - Let the man be. - Amen. - Amen, Amen. Look what I have fit in here. See, my beautiful wife and my son and my daughter, all of them gone. There is a guard who has a dog who looks just like the dog I used to have. Go to sleep. When I look at that dog, I remember when we were all together, my mother and father and sister. One day, they came and pulled us out of our house, and they put us in different trucks, and I never saw them again. Do you know how I can find them? Try to fall asleep if you can. What are you looking at, you little filthy Jewish boy? I wasn't looking at anything. Your liar. Your dog attacked me, I will kill him. - No! - No, no, please. Blitz is one of the best-trained dogs in the camp. Please Dr. Schneider, I really don't know what happened. I will shoot this dog through the head. Get back to work, all of you! If you shoot the dog, you will have to kill me too. Come. That bastard almost broke your neck. These people are animals. Why do you pray so much? If there were a God, he would not let this be happening to us. No one is listening to you. The important thing is, that I can hear the prayer. Come here. My dog has obviously taken some kind of interest in you. - What is your dog's name? - Blitz. May I pet him? I'd rather that you didn't. You see, he probably needs the company of a child. I used to have a dog like this. Oh really, what was his name? Kaleb. So you had a dog and you like animals. Very much. Follow me. Perhaps you would like to work feeding and cleaning the animals' cages. Your small size would be good for that. I would like that very much. Then I will arrange for it. This is for the animals only. He really does seem to like you. Yes. The bread crumbs are for the chickens and ducks. The peas and vegetables for the pigs. If you eat or steal one crumb of food, you will be shot. Do you understand that? - Yes. - Fine, then begin. It's you Kaleb, isn't it? Isn't it? You can trust that boy? Yes, of course, but what difference does it make? He'll eventually wind up in a pit with everyone else. Well, I'm quite impressed with your dog. He's the most intelligent dog that I've come across in my entire life, he understands everything. So what do you intend to do after the war is over? I'd like to study engineering, or religious studies. You don't want to continue training animals? - Perhaps. - All right. Sorry to cut short our little stroll, but tomorrow is a busy day. We have a new train load coming in. No, no, no. - It's all right, Mr. Glavsky. - Wake up, wake up. - It's all right. - Wake up. - Mr. Glavsky. - Close your eyes. I can't stop. That day, I was a priest in a small church near the mountains. I spoke out against the cruelty of this regime. Some people from my parish supported me, and the soldiers came and shot them, right in front of my eyes. I wish they would have shot me instead. How much longer can we survive this? If we use everything we know, all of us together, we can escape from here. How do you intend to get past the electrified fence? And how will you escape the Ukrainians and the dogs? Hello, Rivka, how are you today? Eat something, Shlomo. You look too thin. There, Kaleb. - Did you bring us any food? - I can't. They're watching me to make sure I don't steal anything. At night, we come there and help you get some of it. No, it is too dangerous. Starving to death is dangerous. Don't forget the small packages. I won't forget, everything will arrive on time. That's all? Is that all? It's just a few breadcrumbs. It doesn't require two blessings. Tell the dogs good night. - Was it delicious then? - Yes. What is he doing? Uh, that's his way of telling me he wants more. Well, he can't eat it all. He has to give some to the other dogs. Put him on a leash and bring him to me. Yes sir. The boy knows what would happen to him if he would so much has touch this food for himself, right? Oh, yes. Blitzie, Blitz. Blitz! This dog is a true servant of the Reich. What do we have here? And this accidentally fell into your pocket. I told you what would happen if you were caught stealing food from the animals, didn't I? Shame on you. Before you kill me, there's one thing you should know. All this time that I took care of Blitz, as you call him, I was not taking care of your dog, but my dog. His name is Kaleb. What are you talking about? He was born on a Tuesday at 11:30 in the morning, and has three brothers and sisters. So you see, Herr Gerstler, your beloved Blitz is really a Jewish dog. That's most unfortunate news, turn around. Come, we must go. Wait, come on, Kaleb. Come, come, Kaleb. Kaleb, Kaleb, come, come, come. Kaleb let's go, come. Kaleb, come. Kaleb, come with me now, Kaleb. Kaleb, no. No, no, Kaleb, Kaleb. Kaleb come, come, come here. Kaleb, Kaleb. Where is he going? Just follow him. It hurts. Oh my God. You were hit. I think the bullet might still be in you. If I had a knife, maybe I could get it out, but this wound has to be disinfected. Should I go get something? The forest is crawling with Germans and their dogs. We'll wait until the sun rises. It's your job to guard us now, Kaleb, with your good ears, to make sure no one is coming close to us. Am I going to die? Try to lie still. I've been a good man. Yes, you have. Maybe now I can see my Getel in heaven. My dear friend. I'm grateful that I will die a free man, here in God's beautiful forest, and not in that den of iniquity. Our fellow prisoners will never even have a burial. Come, let's go. I think Mr. Neuman would like it if we say a prayer for him. Where are we going? We have to keep moving south, maybe towards Yugoslavia. And according to where the sun is rising and setting, we are going south. But we must find food and water. What is it, Kaleb? Go down there. You are small, it will be easier for you. I will watch you from here, go. Kaleb, you stay with me, Kaleb. There. In case you are hungry. Let's go get it. No, no, it could be an ambush. Let's go. Don't worry, we will do you no harm. - Are you lost? - No. My son and I, we, our home was destroyed and my, my wife didn't make it. I'm sorry to hear that. Beautiful dog. Thank you. Come on in. - Come. - Just come. - It will be warm inside. - Yeah, it'll be all right. We can allow you to sleep here, but only for one night. It's very dangerous these days, if you understand what I'm saying. And you would have to sleep in the barn. That would be fine. We very much appreciate it. - Just one night. - Yes. Joshua, you and Kaleb crawl under here now. No, no, we can't go without you. Now, right now, before it's too late. And remember to watch where the sun rises and sets, and keep running to the south. - No. - Go. I know, Kaleb, I know. This one is mine. It's just us now. Do you think Mama and Papa and Rachel could also be somewhere in the forest? What would I do without you, Kaleb? I don't want that you just listen to me, and never tell me your thoughts. I will try to understand your thoughts. Blitz will be your name. It must be Palm Sunday. I remember the people across the way used to carry these flowers. So that must mean it's Passover too. Papa. Mama. Rachel. Our guests, that you always have at Seder... and me. When we dip this in the salt water, it will remind us of the tears that the Jewish people shed when they were in the land of Egypt. Remember when you were a little puppy, and you found the afikomen? Well, actually we... I cheated, because I put the smell of meat on the matzah. Sometimes I worry that you miss Ralph. It's hard for you to understand who he really was. He loved you and really cared for you. But I love you too. Don't move, who are you? Joshua. My name is Sasha Petrovich. - Did Kaleb bring you? - Who's Kaleb? - My dog. - No. Kaleb? We can't take on the responsibility of a child, and an injured one. We are Yugoslavian partisans, you are safe with us. We will protect you. We can't have a child with us. He's no longer a child with what he's gone through. Pick him up and take him with us. I... I can't go without Kaleb. The most important thing is your own life. Pick him up. Trees and darkness at night are your most loyal allies. The winter is your friend, since the days are short and the nights long. Do you understand everything I'm saying? Otherwise, you will never get out. Always let your enemy have the illusion that he is chasing you. Your real power lies in the element of surprise. - That's what Kaleb does. - Kaleb? My dog. Oh yes, you must forget about this dog. Whatever you do, don't actually shoot a gun. It will make too much noise. It's a fine gun, isn't it? I don't really like guns. These days, it will be your best friend. Kaleb is my best friend. It's quite beautifully made. I took it myself from the shoulder of a Nazi. Aim at the bottles. I told you not to shoot the gun. - You want Germans here? - It was an accident. There's no room for accidents here. It was my fault. - Shh. - She told me not to... You see what you have done? No, no! Kaleb, no, don't shoot, don't shoot. It's Kaleb. Kaleb. I knew you would find me. We will divide into three squads. The first squad will put an ambush on the road to the village. The second will go into a house to take the food and clothing we need. The third group will attack the German soldiers patrolling the area. Any questions from anyone? Yes, Joshua? Am I going on this assignment too? Perhaps, I'm not sure yet. Hello, is someone there? - Hello? - Come in. Oh, no no, no. No, don't hurt us. Oh my God, please, no. No, no, no, not the animals, please. They keep us alive. Joshua, you helped us a lot today. Thank you. But you cannot stay with us, it's too difficult. It's too dangerous for us and for you. But where can I go? We managed to borrow some money from the farmers today, and we'll buy you a passage to Palestine. - Palestine? - You will be safe there. Please, let me stay with you. Here's for the boy's passage, and I've also brought you the dog. Be brave little man, you will have a better life. Come, we must hurry. You cannot take the dog with you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Kaleb is coming with me. We have no room for a dog. He's part of the payment for your passage, he's mine now. No, Kaleb is coming with me. We are letting you go because you are a child and you are alone. This is why I have Kaleb, so I don't have to be alone. He's staying here. No Kaleb, Kaleb. Kaleb, no, Kaleb! Kaleb, Kaleb, come, come, Kaleb, Kaleb. - No, no, Kaleb, Kaleb. - Sit down, quiet. - Calm down. - Kaleb. Calm down, it'll be okay. No, no, Kaleb. Come here, dog. Hey, dog, come here, do what I say. Dog! Hey dog, come here. Kaleb. No, no, no, go back. We have to rescue him, he'll drown. - Please help, stop the boat. - Sit down. Turn, turn the boat around, please. - Shh. - Kaleb, go back. Kaleb! Let's turn the boat around. Let's turn, turn it. Kaleb, Kaleb. Kaleb. - All right, grab the oar. - Give the man a hand. Kaleb, Kaleb. Are we all that's left of our family? What kind of life will we have? Thank you for keeping me warm.
