In Japan, we make many plans. We study hard for big exam. We go to the university. We work for good company and then we have family-approved marriage. My fiance was unfaithful to me. So I had to break up my plan. I quit my job at Masamoto Electric Company and decided to come to America. I told my family I want to have independent American experience. I want to study English and learn about America. I want to visit Yosemite National Park and I want to see Golden Gate Bridge. My friend Chikako wrote me from Japan. She said I will be lonely in America. I told her not to worry. America is very big. I can find a friend. When I first came to United States, my family wrote me every week. Their letters were always the same. They say, "Kyoko, come home. America is not like Japan." [KYOKO SPEAKING JAPANESE] One Yosenabedeluxe, please.One Yosenabedeluxe. Miyako domburi. Miyako domburi. Thank you very much. Thank you. How come they have hakkuginwaitress?I don't know. Wonder if the food's any good? Hey, Kyoko, can you help me with this? I can't figure out how to walk in this thing. It feels like my legs are tied together with bed sheets. Did you wear kimonos in Japan? Yes, I am... I am from Japan. No, I know. I asked if you wore kimonos in Japan. You look nice in kimono. Do you like wear kimono? Kimono is old Japan. I don't like it. How do I look?Nice. MAN: So would you like to go out with me or not? Are you ready to order now? Where would you like to go tonight? We have a tempura sashimi special today. How special is it? I'll come back in a few minutes. See that, Dennis? She digs me. Thank you for coming.Thank you. Okay. Sayonara. Bye-bye.Bye now. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] That's pretty cold-blooded.What is? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] ...engaged. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] What'd she say? She said her fiance was messing around with some waitress. So she broke off their engagement and came here. I guess everybody's on her butt about it, including her own family. So what's she gonna do now? I think she wants to stay here. Right? [BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE] [CHUCKLES] She wants to go to school but her English isn't good enough, so she studies at night. I want to stay here.She wants to stay here. Okay, goodnight. KYOKO: "Dear Family, "thank you very much for your letter and the package. "The dried fish was very delicious, "but it was too much for me to eat myself, "so I gave some to my friends at work. "I am enjoying my visit here. "But sometimes I have a hard time expressing myself in English. "Please say hello to Chikako. Tell her I will write soon. "I hope you do not worry for me. "I have a very nice room at the YWCA. "Although my travel visa has expired, I still want to stay here." "Yes, it is refreshing. Yes, it is refreshing. "May I have another, please? May I have another, please? "Lesson number 12." [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] Hi, Ken. It's Lana. Did I wake you? No? Oh, good. Huh? How's it going? I did wake you up, huh? No, go back to sleep. No, it wasn't important. No, I just wanted to apologize for the other day. Yeah, I know I made a big deal about you helping me with my act, and I flaked out. Well, listen, why don't you come down the restaurant tomorrow for dinner? Around 9:00. Yeah, I'll treat you. Okay? Okay, I'll see you tomorrow night. Okay, great. Mmm-hmm. Bye. I woke him up. Sure.Thanks. MICHELLE: Who was on the phone?KEN: I don't know. Great, Ken. There's no coffee. I forgot. What am I supposed to do without my coffee?I'm sorry. You know I need coffee in the morning. I forgot. How about some cocoa?Coffee! You were sitting on my socks. Are you mad at me? Not mad. More like exhausted. I mean, what's the point? You want to talk about it? Don't want to talk about it. This relationship's been stuck in neutral for over a year and I keep saying the same things over and over again. Did you sleep okay?Don't interrupt. Sorry.Listen, Ken, I just don't want to do this anymore. Okay? Is it sinking in? Are you breaking up with me? You're very perceptive. You sure you don't want to talk about it? 4.19. Keep the change.Thank you. Have a nice day.Thank you. Can I get a jelly donut? Hey, man, you better lighten up on them donuts, huh? How about a manju?What's a manju? You don't know what a manjuis? Oh, man. You don't know what you've been missing. Looks weird. I'd rather have a donut. It's good. It's got sweet beans in it. Eat it. You'll love it. Guaranteed. Told you it was good.MAN: Hey, man, can I get more coffee? What a drag.Yeah. First time he left he said it was because his parents didn't want him going out with a Japanese girl.What'd you do? Let him go. What am I supposed to do? He doesn't want me because his parents want him to marry a white girl. Fine. How'd it go with the white girl?Bad. Real bad. So he comes back to me. But get this, he says he'll stay with me if we can have an open relationship. I said, "Fuck that." Did you ever think that maybe you should find yourself a nice Japanese boy? Where? There aren't any. WAITRESS: One-D-two. Two carry-out burgers. More coffee, girls?

Ken, you gotta come in heavier, man, not with that wimpy stuff. This is heavy metal. Ken. Phone.Who is it? Some girl.Oh, Ken, darling. KEN: Nina, can you just take a message?Sure. I bet it's Michelle, Ken. She wants you. Hey, Ken, don't worry about it. When this band starts gigging, you can have all the women you want. Fuck you, man. She's a high school senior.I'm happy for you, Markie. Man, shut up. Forget women. What are we gonna do with the money when we make it big? I'm gonna buy a limo with a Jacuzzi in it just like Isaac Hayes did. Yeah. And I'm gonna buy a lot of drugs, like Elvis. NINA: Ken, it was your sister, Mimi. She wants you to call her back. She says it's important. Thanks, Nina.Sure. Any time. Okay, you guys can get back to work now. Aren't you gonna stay and listen to us, Nina?I just ate. Okay, guys, this next one's dedicated to Peter Green, and to Ken, on the tragic loss of his girlfriend. [PLAYING HEAVY METAL] [PLAYING GUITAR] ♪ I want to be like Idi ♪ And make a date with Kitty You want shoyu? How's it going, Ken?Same old. How's Michelle? Again? Another big fight? Not really. She just got up and left. Huh... Well, I hope it wasn't too painful. You look okay. I'll live. You mind if we talk about something else? Okay. You got any other action going? You gotta stay in the game, you know? I'm devoting myself to guitar. Ken, man does not live by guitar alone. I could try.Good luck. Hey, how's Mimi?Who? Your sister, bozo.Oh, she's fine. Huh. Well, do you think you could be a little more vague?What? I have to ask you 20 questions to get a two-word answer. I think you're developing a very nihilistic attitude towards conversation. Have you been reading Beckett?Who's that? He's an Irish playwright.Don't know him. He says that words are not adequate to describe emotions. You'd probably like his stuff. It's short and it doesn't make sense. I read a good story about him, though. He got in a fight. This pimp stabbed him and left him to die in the street. And as he lay bleeding to death, this woman came along and took him to the hospital. She was a professional pianist. Later, as he was recuperating, she came to visit. Eventually they got married. Oh.You ought to get married. It might make you talk more. I want to get married. Sooner or later. I could arrange it. How about next week?Perfect. Would you like to marry a Japanese? It would make my mother happy. Superb. There's a Japanese girl who works here. No, she's in the back. She wants to stay in the US and the easiest thing for her to do is to get married. Nakayama is never gonna give her a green card.What are you talking about? Ken, you're the last person in the world to do something spontaneous. This is the perfect opportunity. You just get married, wait for immigration to check, and then you're free! In fact, you might get to like her. I think I'd rather get to know the woman before I marry her. Listen, why can't you get to know her after you're married? The best part of any relationship is getting to know the other person. After that, it's all downhill. How many times have you been married? Twice. Big deal, it's the '80s! You're a strange one to give advice. Come on, what else have you got going? It'll make life interesting. If it works, great! If it fails you can write a song about it. Like Layla. LANA: Hey, Kyoko, can I talk to you for a second? Listen, you know what, I think I might have the answer to your visa problem. There's this guy out front... I haven't convinced him yet, but I think he might go for it. I'm not positive about how all this stuff works, but I think it might be the simplest way for you to stay here. KYOKO: Dear Chikako, I am sorry I haven't written you for so long. I want to tell you what has happened to me. I found a job at a Japanese restaurant. There, my friend introduced me to a very nice Japanese-American man. He took me to dinner and a Clint Eastwood movie, and then we got married. Maybe you think it is strange, but please don't worry about me. I am very happy. I can stay in America. Excuse us. You're from Tokyo? Were you born in Tokyo? Matsuyama. Do you know?No. Where is that? It's on Shikoku Island. Across from Hiroshima Prefecture. Do you know?Hmm. Wait a minute. Here's a baseball cap from the Hiroshima team. My friend Richie gave it to me. Hiroshima cap.Mmm. Do you want it? It's too small for me. It's very nice. You look good. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] KYOKO: Dear Chikako, I will tell you about my new husband. He is a very nice man. His name is Ken. Like Takakura Ken, the movie star. He has very good job in important American company. And he is very good worker. He cannot speak Japanese, but is very interest in Japanese life. I hope you will meet him sometime if you come to visit me. But please do not tell my family about Japanese-American man because maybe they will worry. I hope you are well. I miss you. Sometimes when I have trouble with my English I wish you are here so I could talk to someone. Have the plum trees in Hanegi Park blossomed yet? Well, Ken is nice, even if he doesn't talk much. Mr. Ken is nice, yeah.Better than some of the boyfriends I've had. Do you have boyfriend?A couple. You have many boyfriends. Well, right now I like this 18-year-old I met at a U2 concert. And the sax player from the Bay Lounge...Really? KEN: Look, it's got to be The Who. None of those wimp bands are as loud as they were. They can make you deaf. The Guinness Book of World Recordscalled them the loudest rock band ever. I don't care what you say. Led Zeppelin was louder. I lived at 3rd and Irving when they played Kezar. My walls were shaking from Communication Breakdown. It was 8.5 on the Richter scale and I was six blocks away. Zep was loud.I did acid before one of their shows at the coliseum and they were so loud they made me un-stoned.They could do that to you. I used to love to ball to Kashmir.What is Kashmir? It's a song on Physical Graffiti. I made a tape of it. It took up one whole side of a cassette. My old lady hated it! LAMBERT: Kashmir?Yeah. So how about you, Lambert? You laying any pipe? You got a babe? My cousin introduced me to this girl, but she said I was too polite. Boy. Nice guys always get screwed, you know? And I don't mean the good way. How about you, bubba? You uh, you got any sad stories? I got married.[CHUCKLING] Married? To who? JIMBO: Why didn't you say something?Oh, congratulations, Ken. Thanks. She's from Japan.Japanese women are so beautiful. Well, jeez, this is terrific! Kenny bit the big one! Congratulations! Here, take my Snowball. Here, here's my sandwich, Ken. You're gonna need all your strength. Thanks, guys. I'll take you to lunch tomorrow. Uh, anywhere you want to go. SHERI: You married Ken? That slug friend of Lana's? Just because he plays in a rock 'n' roll band doesn't mean he's Paul McCartney. Can he even talk? Mr. Ken and I are husband and wife so I can obtain green card. You Japanese people are so weird. Kyoko, it ain't worth it! I know that guy. He used to go fishing with my brother. The fish had more personality. Oh, God, how do I... [SPEAKING BROKEN JAPANESE] Lana told me this best solution for green card. For staying in this country. I am illegal alien. I know. But you can do better than Ken. I mean, you have to live in the same house with the guy. You have to watch him eat. You have... Have you slept with him?We have separate beds. That's good. Keep it that way. And get yourself a baseball bat, and if he comes anywhere near you, whack! "Whack"? I don't understand. [SIGHS] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Yes, I understand. We have baseball in Japan. Mr. Ken is very nice. Lana told me Ken will grow on me. Ken will grow on you? Like a fungus. [SIGHING] God, Lana must've been crazy. What was she thinking, putting you with him? Lana is very nice. Yeah, right. Everybody's nice. Everybody wants to help the girl from Japan. [WIND HOWLING] Morning, bud.Hey. Shall we go?Yeah. "Lesson four. I met Noki at the supermarket today." Yeah, she was great. She used to do my French homework for me. Sister, you seem so alone. I'm a member of the Sunlight Tribe. Think of me as your brother. Hey, pretty lady! "No kidding." [INDISTINCT READING] "It looked like he was driving someone..." [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Thank you. Why do you think Ken's having us wait out here, rather than meeting her in the restaurant? I don't know. Hey, maybe Kyoko has some friends she can introduce us to. What do you think?I think that that would not be appropriate now. Lambert, you are so...Shh, quiet! Here they come. Hey, guys. I want you to meet my wife, Kyoko. Wow, she's great.Kyoko, this is Warren, and Lambert. Hi, Kyoko. It is very nice meeting you, Kyoko. Ken has told us so much about you. Are you enjoying your stay here in this country? Yes. I enjoy very much. That's good. I know how difficult it must be to be a newcomer here. Oh, yeah. Lambert's from Hong Kong.I'm from Taiwan. Anyway, Kyoko, I am very pleased to finally meet you. If you need any help, please let us know. Thank you. I am sorry, I have to go back to work. Please excuse me. Sure. Uh... We gotta go, too.Yeah, nice to meet you, Kyoko. Nice to meet you. I hope to see you again. Goodbye, Mr. Ken.Bye, Kyoko. I'll see you later. She is great, Ken. You are a very lucky man, Ken.Thanks. WARREN: Say, Ken, do you think Kyoko can introduce me to one of her friends? I don't know. I thought you had a girlfriend. LAMBERT: That's right! I am the one who needs a girlfriend. Cathy dumped me. Oh, man, if I could find someone like Kyoko, I would be happy for sure. That is simplistic. Happiness is not so easy. Ken is very lucky. Kyoko is very nice. But you can't pick a woman off a tree and be happy. I'm pretty happy. Yeah, see? All you got to do is find the right woman. Anyway, where'd you get your experience from, Lambert? What makes you so smart?Why do you think? I am Chinese. Oh, brother. Hey, I bought this for you. It's manju. Thank you. It is really nice of you to think of me. Manjuis my favorite. Mr. Ken, who is in that? Oh, this? That's The Velvet Underground. Lou Reed. Do you know Lou Reed?Yes. Lu Reedo. No. Lou Reed.I know. Walk On the Wild Side.That's right. Venus in Furs, Sweet Jane. You know those songs? No, thanks.Please take, Mister Ken. I don't like Japanese food.But you are Japanese also. No, I'm not. Not like you. It is refreshing. May I have another, please? Now, guys, as we all know, there's a certain amount of posturing that goes on with this music. The basic idea is to try to look like you're having a good, high energy time on stage, okay? Because if you have a good time, then the audience is gonna have a good time. So, for example, never just hit a note. Always make the most out of it. Grimace. Never just hit a note like this. That's lame. No one's gonna enjoy themselves. Go like this. Okay? You guys don't seem very enthusiastic. This is a lifestyle, not a hobby. [RINGING] [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Ex... Excuse. Hello. Ken? Ken is not here. Yes, please. Uh, I understand. Ken... Ken's sister. Dinner. Friday? Yes. Be sure he gets the message. Thank you. Yes. Goodbye. How weird! Some Japanese woman answered Ken's phone. Carl, I think Ken has a Japanese woman living with him. That's interesting. Do you think we should check it out? We could go over there and pretend to bring a pie or something. Don't look at me like that! Someone has to look after him. RICHIE: Ken, I'm a little apprehensive about this whole marriage business with you. I think the secret to being successful at this kind of stuff is staying on the edge. You know? Uh, so eat pizza, you know, hamburgers, hot dogs, things like that. You know, on the fly. Just the idea that you don't want to become complacent, okay? And marriage is one of those institutions that if you're not careful, it puts you in the grave. Because look at The Beatles, okay? When the women got involved with The Beatles, there was trouble, okay? The band broke up. That was a tragedy. Lord, that group was so talented. See what I'm saying? Okay, you got to remember that. [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO] MAN: [IN JAPANESE ACCENT] ♪ Can you dance with me WOMAN: ♪ Sure, why not [BOTH SINGING IN JAPANESE] "How did four poor boys from Los Angeles "graduate to Black music heaven? "Simple. "They did their Black Studies methodically "for a long time and they acknowledge their prior Funk mentors.

"So if you and your old lady feels like burning down a house, "permit me to make a suggestion. "Lay your hands on the new Chili Peppers LP "and prepare for some radical freaky. "It will heal your ailing soul with a funky sort of R and B." Mr. Ken?What? What's meaning "funky sort of R and B"? I don't know. I used to think there was something called magic. And then, after about five years, I thought maybe there's something called magic and after about ten years I figured there wasn't. Well, I think I got it. Magic?Yeah. Could be, you know.I think I'm in love. Well, that's different. I mean, that's different than magic. I thought they were the same thing. I... Well, they start out the same. Probably. I mean, magic and love are the same thing, but I figure if it lasts for a while, it's love. If it doesn't last for a while, then it's magic. I don't know what I have. Oh. Well, I mean, I don't even know what "a while" is, you know. Could be a... She's really great, though. You should meet her.Oh, yeah? Love to. Sure you don't want some chili on that? Homemade, out of the can. All right. Bon appetit,bro. Hey, Ken, I hear you're in Richie's new band. That's really great. Hi, Lindy. Hey, listen, do you guys need a singer? I've been looking for a good band. Richie says girls and heavy metal don't mix. That's kind of stupid. I mean, what about Pat Benatar? Joan Jett? That's pop music. Oh, brother. Listen, I made this tape. Why don't you come over to my place tonight and we'll listen to it? If you like it, you can give it to Richie. Richie won't go for that. Anyway, I can't. I have to pick my wife up. Your wife? Who'd marry you, you jerk? And listen, if you see Richie, you can tell him he's a jerk, too! Okay. Ah. Parsley goes there. Lemon go... [BOTH SPEAKING JAPANESE] [JAPANESE SONG PLAYING] Okay, thank you. Good night.Good night. [PLAYING LATIN MUSIC] [CASTANETS CLICKING] KEN: Lana, I think you should find someone else to play guitar. No, you're doing fine. Come on, keep playing. Well, I think it's worked out pretty well. I mean, I like her a lot. But I can't tell if she likes me. Well, you don't hate each other. That's a good sign. Maybe. There's something that isn't right. We don't connect.You mean sexually? No. I mean understanding each other. Does she ever talk about me? Yeah. She says you're really nice.I'm really nice? That's all? Well, I don't know. For God's sake, give it time. You're from completely different cultures. These things take time to develop. Especially mixed marriages. Look at John and Yoko. John and Yoko? Yeah. I mean, I really admired them. Didn't you? Look at all the ups and downs they went through. That's your advice? John and Yoko? You have a very crummy attitude, Ken. You have to have a little more faith. Things'll look a lot better after you have a cup of decaf. I hate that shit. Ken. I'm sorry. It's just that everybody's been telling me what to do. I get kind of tired of it.What does Mimi say? I didn't tell her. She doesn't even know I'm married. She doesn't know? She's your sister. I can't tell her. She'll tell Carl, then she'll tell Dad, and he'll hit the ceiling. He already thinks I'm fucked up. What are you staring at?You. See, I told you this marriage would be good for you. I told you it would make you talk more. I was right. You worry too much. Everything'll be all right. Besides, Japanese women always stand by their men, right? You think so?Definitely. Let me help you with your lesson. It is not necessary.I want to. Okay. I'm here. Okay. Here we go. "What kind of present did you send the chief?" "I gave him a box of canned food." "That's a nice present.""Thank you. How about you?" "Napoleon whiskey." "Wow! You really went all out." You already know this one by heart. Yes. I studied it before. Thank you. You don't have to be so formal. You know, we've slept together. It's nice, but I think we should be less formal if we want to get to know each other. Mr. Ken, why did you marry me? To help you stay in this country. What will happen when marriage is over? Will you divorce and marry another? I was hoping we would like each other enough to stay married. I expected this marriage was temporary. I know. But we've been living together, and I thought... Do you know what I'm saying? Mmm-hmm. Do you like living here with me? I think you're a real nice person, Mr. Ken. I think we can have a good marriage. We never fight. May we start again? Sure. "Next station, Omotesando. Exit on the left." "Is that before Gaia Maya?" KYOKO: I am afraid. Mr. Ken is forgetting our plan. Our marriage is arranged marriage for business reasons. It is not real marriage. We agreed our marriage is only temporary. But now I think he feels love for me. It is mistake. [BEEPS] Mimi, hi. This is Ken. I'm sorry, but something's come up and I won't be able to make it to dinner tonight. Bye. KEN: I mean, look at Brian Ferry. His music is so much better since Jerry Hall dumped him. Have you seen his new video? Oh, man, it's slick! You know, I wish I had hair like his. Oh, shit.What? Get in the car! Mimi... I... I'm sorry, I...I said get in! If you don't get in, I will never speak to you again. It's your family, too. Now get in! How you doing, Ken?Okay. MIMI: I have been calling you for a month! Hi, Dad.Hi, Mr. Nakamoto. Hey, you guys are early. I was just putting on some broccoli. Hey, how you doing, Carl?Pretty darn good, Mr. Nakamoto. Hey, Dad, you look great. Have you been jogging? Oh, just the usual. Go to work, watch TV, and go to bed. Sounds pretty darn good to me, Mr. Nakamoto. Carl and I just had our best month ever. We haven't officially closed it yet, but our commissions will probably be close to $6,000. That's great, Mimi. We earn it. You should see some of the turkeys we have to deal with. CARL: Hey, look at Mimi. Yeah. Little princess. Hey, watch it, bub. That's my wife you're talking about. Hey, you were pretty cute, too. The perfect son. Perfect Japanese son. Mimi used to call me bo chan.What's that mean? Something like "mama's boy." Hey, look, Ken, it was really a good move, your coming here tonight. I know Mimi and your dad really appreciate seeing you. I guess so. Carl, have some more broccoli. It's good for you. Dad, Ken's playing in a rock and roll band. Out of sight. What do you play, guitar? Yeah. I'm not very good yet. All you have to do is practice. Do you practice somewhere? Two or three times a week at Richie's. His apartment's full of hippies. They don't care if we make noise. Too stoned. MIMI: Well, if you play somewhere, we'll come see you. That'll be neat. Don't you think so, Dad? That's nice. But that isn't a real job. Carl, get enough to eat? We're trying to eat more vegetables.Fiber. It's good for the colon. Here you go.Thank you, dear. Where's Ken? I think he's out back.Okay. What are you thinking about? Remember that time I brought Michelle here for dinner? Sorta. It was a couple of years ago. Dad liked her because she talked a lot and she was so pretty. Mom didn't like her at all. I remember she asked me if Michelle was really Japanese. She said she didn't act like it. She didn't like Carl either, at first. Did you ever see those Japanese movies where the parents arrange a marriage for their children? Couples don't even know each other the night before they marry. They're scared to death on their wedding night, then one day something bad happens and they fall in love. Maybe that's what I should do. What do you think, Mimi? I think that this is not Japan, bo chan. Carl and I have been together for five years. And before that, I knew him for four. Sometimes working together makes it hard 'cause we get on each other's nerves, but, sometimes it's really nice, you know? Huh.Anyway, I never wanted to marry someone where I didn't know what he did for eight hours a day. I guess it's hard keeping a relationship going. When I did drugs it used to depress me 'cause they wore off so fast. The feeling wouldn't last. And everything would return to normal. What are you talking about?Nothing. Anyway, what would you say if I did that? Did what?Married a girl from Japan. Well... I guess it would depend on the girl. Yeah. KEN: Kyoko, I'm sorry I didn't pick you up tonight. I had to go see my family. It is fine, Mr. Ken. I rode the bus. Oh, yeah, this postcard came for you. What's it say? Who's it from? This is from my family. Oh, yeah? What do they say? Are you interest? Yeah, I'm interested. Go ahead and read it. They say they miss me and they worry for me and they hope I am enjoying American experience. Well, that sounds good. My mother say, it is very hot in Japan and rain very much. And she said she hope I can come back for Obon. What's Obon? It is time when Japanese children visit their family. And they make horse with vegetables so ancestors come down and get on the horse to visit us and at the end of the Obon we burn it. So smoke, with the smoke, ancestors go back to the heaven. That sounds good. Maybe we can go there after we get through immigration. I could borrow some money from my sister. Mr. Ken, it is difficult. It's just a thought. I still think you should think about what we talked about, staying married. Mr. Ken, I would like to sleep with myself tonight. Please. Are you sure?Yes. Okay. No problem. I'll watch some video. [SINGING IN JAPANESE] KYOKO: It is better our marriage is temporary. I cannot blame Mr. Ken for my situation. He does not understand me. But it is not his fault. I cannot speak my feeling in English. He cannot speak his feeling in Japanese. [TRADITIONAL JAPANESE MUSIC PLAYING] [COIN RATTLING] You ever have the tuna sandwiches? Yeah. It's good. Make sure you take the lettuce out. Your sister drives a BMW.Yeah. Yeah, that's a nice car. How come she yelled at you? I don't know. She's always been like that. Very emotional, you know. I wish I could get married. Why? I don't like going to movies by myself. You're lucky. Maybe. But you know what Bob Marley said? "No woman, no cry." LAMBERT: You got it made, Ken. "I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. "I'm so sorry to have you... "Kept you waiting. "Please come right in. "Please come right in." RICHIE: Say, Ken, do you have the first Back Street Crawler LP? The band or the Kossoff solo? The solo.Yeah. How about loaning that to me? It's out of print. I'll tape it for you. That'd be great. There is some gut-wrenching guitar on that LP. Yeah, Kossoff was great. Too bad he died. Yeah, he's in rock and roll heaven with Jimi. NINA: Excuse me, but do you guys know how to talk about anything but rock and roll? What else is there?What else is there? Nina, what'd you think of that last one we did? Good. Real good. It was an original. Mmm-hmm. Honey, you don't seem very supportive. I'll get more enthusiastic when you get more successful. How did someone intelligent like you ever end up going out with a guy like Richie? NINA: We used to go to the same laundromat. Hey, please, please. Do you mind if we don't talk about my personal life? Oh, sensitive. No, Markie, I'm not sensitive. I just think we'd be a lot better off talking about the band, okay? Isn't rock and roll kind of dead? I mean, it seems like you'd be better off getting into some Ornette Coleman Harmolodic Jazz or something like that. I mean, that music has a lot more potential. Well, Nina, the problem with that is that you have to know how to play to do that kind of music. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] You know I can't speak Japanese. [SPEAKING JAPANESE] You want to go out tonight? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] All right, Mrs. Nakamoto, I have a few questions here that will assist us in ascertaining the legality of your marriage. Please answer truthfully and remember that any discrepancies in your answers can and will lead to your immediate deportation. Is that clear? Please answer "yes" or "no." I understand.Very good. Now, please pay attention, Mrs. Nakamoto. What color shirt did your husband wear yesterday? What kind of toothpaste do you have in your bathroom and who purchased it? How many pairs of shoes does your husband own and where does he keep them? What is his favorite food? Hamburger. What is your favorite food? Italian food. Name the members of your husband's immediate family. I have never met. Macaroni and cheese. And any kind of Mexican food. INTERVIEWER: And what is her favorite food? Japanese, I guess. Well, she has a mother and a father. But I'm not sure about the rest. We haven't talked much about... You've been married for two months and you don't know the members of her family? They're in Japan. Mr. Nakamoto, some of your answers contradict what your wife said. KEN: Well, what do you expect? Her English isn't that good. In addition, you were unable to answer several of the questions yourself. How do you explain that? Certainly you do not have a problem with the English language. We are married. That is still in question. If you insist, we can recommend an additional interview, possibly at your place of residence. I don't care. We are married. You can interview us as many times as you like. You'll be notified. It's just that some of those questions were hard to... The interview is over. Please take your forms and return them to the clerk. Kyoko, why are you taking your bike? I can pick you up after work. It is not necessary, Mr. Ken. Are you sure? I am fine. Please excuse. I have to go to work. Okay. I have an ant farm at home, you know. And last night I dreamt that all the ants got together and rebelled. They pushed the lid off the ant farm and started throwing my furniture around. And the whole apartment was full of giant fire ants. And they were really pissed off. They were like a red menace. Oh, want one?No, thank you. What I was talking about? A dream. You know? Sleep? Dream? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Yes. I had a dream about Japan. You were homesick. My grandmother used to get homesick. Your grandmother came from Japan? A long time ago. She always wanted to go back, but she never did. Too much nihonjinpride. You know what that means? Pride? [SPEAKING JAPANESE] Yes. Japanese have very much pride. Yeah, I guess we do. You know, Kyoko, if you want to go home, you should. I will stay in America. Okay. Leaving already? Yeah. See you, Lane. Okay, Jeannie. Take it easy. Bye. Man, I used to have such a crush on her. Did you guys go out? Nah. We hung with different crowds. You know, she was in the key club. Now she's married to some big-shot real estate lawyer. And look at me, I'm still a fucking manjuman. What's wrong with that? Yeah. Yeah. At least I don't have to listen to a bunch of suits when they tell me to breathe, huh? Fuck. You should've made a move on her. Yeah, maybe I should've. Hey, Lane, you want to see a picture of my wife? Yeah. Oh. She's really Japanese, huh? She looks fine, though. Don't screw it up. KYOKO: Dear Chikako, how are you and your family? I am fine, but many things have happened since I wrote you last time. Do you remember the Japanese-American man I told you about? He is dead. It was great tragedy. And now I am too sad to stay in the United States. I will return to Japan soon. Dear Mr. Ken, I'm sorry, I have to leave, because I cannot be a good wife for you. You are very nice but I cannot stay. I hope you find someone and will be happy. Goodbye. Don't be down. Love, Kyoko. [PHONE RINGING] Jasmine.Thanks. I've been thinking. How would you like to come and work with Carl and me at the travel service? Thanks for the offer but I don't think so. Well, you don't have to answer right now. Think about it. You want to tell me what's been going on? You don't have to, but I'd like to know. Maybe later. Thanks for the tea. Sure. Mr. Rocklay was looking for you. Yeah. I'm working on the ventilation system. That's good. You should take it easy, Ken. Lambert, you ever think about going back to Hong Kong? Taiwan.Well, Taiwan, then? When I came to the United States, I never thought I would be working a job like this. Five dollars an hour. I thought I'd be rich by now. So? Can't you go back? It's too late to go back. If you stay too long, you have to stay. It's too hard to go back now. Well, maybe you'll strike it rich some day. That is propaganda put out by rich people. They get poor people to work for no money by spreading those stories. You should become a musician. One hit record and you got it made. You're not as smart as you look. How many Asians you know with hit records? Well, it could be the first. KYOKO: Dear Mr. Ken, I took package tour to Yosemite National Park. It is very beautiful. I think you would like the natural setting. Now I am in Japan with my family and friends. They are happy I am back from America. How are you? How is your rock and roll band? If you want to, you can write to me in Tokyo. Your friend, Kyoko. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING]
