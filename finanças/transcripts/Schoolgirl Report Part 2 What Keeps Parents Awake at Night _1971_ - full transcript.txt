Today's youth. Self-critical and rebellious youth. Youth who are both down-to-earth and idealistic. The young people who triggered the sexual revolution. The first Schoolgirl Report told you all about... ...masturbation... ...petting, that is, playful intimate contact... ...deflowering, or losing one's virginity... ...intercourse, and same-sex love. Filled with sensational information, the film opened many parents'eyes. So we had to do further studies... ...gather more information... ...and reveal the facts that even young people don't like to talk about. SCHOOLGIRL REPORT 2: WHAT KEEPS PARENTS AWAKE AT NIGHT A Wolf C. Hartwig Production Based on the book by Günther Hunold With an epilogue by Kurt Seelmann Former Director, City Youth Office of Munich Starring many anonymous youth and parents And as reporter: Written by Music by Theme written by Photography Design Editor and Assistant Director Directed by Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Friedrich von Thun. I conducted the interviews in the first Schoolgirl Report. At the time, we had not planned on making a second episode. But the overwhelming response of viewers forced us to do a sequel. We received 1,665 letters. Out of these true stories, we've selected the most interesting. We've also invited some viewers to introduce them to you. I'm Annemarie Schmitt, 40 years old. I'm a doctor of philosophy and teach at a girls' school in Munich. Can you confirm... ...that the cases we portrayed in the first Schoolgirl Report... ...are typical of today's youth? Not all schoolgirls are like that. But the film never claimed they were. There's no doubt that today's youth have moral beliefs... ...that differ from those of their elders' generation. I see you have a certain understanding for the young girls' behavior. After all, you can hardly close your eyes to the facts. That's certainly right. But even if today's girls reach sexual maturity sooner... ...intellectually, they're still not grown-up. One case comes to mind... ...that had to do with 18-year-old girls at school. "To Doctor Kurt Mallinger." I hope he doesn't recognize your handwriting. Give me a break! Don't worry, I typed it. We'll show him. Here he comes. Why aren't you in the classroom, ladies? Pardon me. Please adjust your clothes. I wanted to, but I've lost a button. Well, that's all right. Now back to your seats. Dr. Mallinger, my father asked me to give you this. Can't your father come to the parent-teacher meeting? I'm afraid he can't. He only has time tomorrow afternoon. Then he's got a plane to catch. Him and his weird job. Civil engineer is not a weird job. Even if he does work in Africa. But I'll make an exception for him. Tell him I'll come by tomorrow at 4:00. Okay, Dr. Mallinger. Hold on, Eflie. Why don't you demonstrate today's experiment? That way, I can tell your father something positive tomorrow. Attention, please. Today, we're dealing with friction and the warming of conductive bodies... ...and how we can make use of this fact of physics. In short, it's the way electrical fuses... What's wrong, Christa? Nothing, I'm just tingly all over. Well, we haven't turned on the power yet. Not yet. - Elfie, the line must be taut. - I'll make sure of that. Don't be childish and pay attention. It'll help you later on if, after all the theory... ...you get some idea of the practical... Elfie! The current's running in the wrong direction. You just got a good jolt, Dr. Mallinger. If you're so tingly... ...then I advise you to take more cold showers. But without electricity, because that could come to a nasty ending. Touché! - Are you ready, Elfie? - I'm always ready, Doctor. Then switch it on. Since you seem to be so interested in electricity, Christa... ...describe the experiment. Well, here's how it works. An electrical current runs through a line... ...which creates friction. The more power you have, the more friction there is in the wire... and the hotter it gets. I mean, it depends on how thick the wire is... ...and at some point, it gets hot. Too bad you switched it off. Now it's all limp. And now it's blushing. Continue, Sybille. The more juice it gets, the more red it gets. - More red? - More red, redder, who cares? There it goes. Bang! Serves him right. Elfie, summarize please. From this experiment, it can be seen... ...that during climax... ...you can blow a fuse. Christa, are you completely out of your mind? I have to go to the washroom. Go. These events actually happened during science class. Put yourself in the teacher's shoes. And the letter from Elfie's father? Here's what happened next. Get ready. - And if it doesn't work? - It'll work. Now let's get going. Hello, Dr. Mallinger. Thanks for keeping your appointment. - I'm a bit late. - That doesn't matter. Thank you. I'm afraid I'm in a hurry. I need to grade some papers. Have a seat, Doctor. Cognac or whiskey? My father's bar has everything you like. - I'll have a cognac. - Okay. Tell your father I'm here. It's French cognac. Thank you. I'll do it myself. - See, that's what happens. - I'm so sorry. I thought you were already holding the bottle. That'll stain. Cognac stains. Take off your coat. I'll get hot water and a towel. No, just tell your father that I'm here. First I have to remove the stain, or I'll be in trouble with my father. - What now? - You'll see. Give me a towel. Second drawer. Don't look at me. Watch what he's doing. You were right about the towel, Elfie. That's why I got one. Do you want it? Take it, Dr. Mallinger. It's a beautiful towel. Elfie, have you gone mad? This is outrageous. If your father sees us... What would he say? You, half-undressed... ...the whole house reeking of cognac... ...and me, well... Get dressed now. What are you trying to do to me? What are you afraid of? No need to be afraid. My father left for Africa three days ago. And mother is off playing cards. We're all alone. You know, Dr. Mallinger... ...the whole class has the hots for you. And you're so helpless in a cute way. Such a dedicated teacher... ...deserves a big thank you. You trapped me. So you think it's a trap? Man, she's putting on a good show. He's so shy. I feel sorry for him. Oh, Doctor, do me! Do me several times! That's what I dream of every day in science class. I like it orally first. Well, here's how it works. An electrical current runs through a line... ...which creates friction. The more power you have... ...the more friction there is in the wire... ...and the hotter it gets. It depends on how thick the wire is... ...and at some point, it gets hot. "Today at my place at 4:00, Dr. Mallinger." My parents aren't home either. You know what you're doing, Sybille? Of course I do, Doctor. Then you must also know that I won't be blackmailed like this. No? What a shame. I'm as good as Elfie on the couch. Nice shot, eh? You can keep it. I've got more copies. - Are you coming? - Good morning. We talked about friction yesterday. We talked about friction yesterday. Of course, we talked about friction yesterday. About lines and electricity. And today we have the pictures. We each have a photo. Will you ever fail anyone again? Will you ruin anyone's chance of graduating? Now we know what you are. We know how you are in bed. In bed? You fucked her right there on the couch! What do you want to tell us? What else can you tell us? In the first Schoolgirl Report, I interviewed people in Munich. This time, I've come to Berlin. Can I ask you a few questions about Schoolgirl Report 2? Would you have an affair with one of your teachers? Depends on the teacher. No, I wouldn't. Why not? With the teachers at our school, no way. I don't know. I never thought about it. Hard to say. Depends on the teacher. Yes, I am having an affair. I'm American. Would you have an affair with one of your teachers? Yes, I even know one. If he wanted to, I'd do him. Do you think some students do it to get better grades? Yes, that's possible. There are some attractive teachers. Do you think some students do it to get better grades? Yes, certainly. That's possible. It's better to sleep with the teacher than fail a class. Why not? If she's smart. Should a teacher be punished for sleeping with a student? No, if he didn't rape her, and both had fun. - No. - Even if she's a minor? She should know what she's doing. Would you sleep with an older man... ...or someone your own age? Same age. - An older man. - Why? Older men are more tender and more experienced... ...so they can make you come faster. Mr. Gephart, you're the legal adviser for the city school board. - Do you know of Dr. Mallinger? - Yes. How do you assess the case from a legal point of view? First, under the Criminal Code... ...Section 174 states... ...that anyone who sexually abuses a minor under 21 entrusted to his care... ...shall be punishable by at least six months' imprisonment. But the abuse was initiated by the girl. That has no bearing on the culpability of the offense. The teacher is an adult of sound mind. The minimum sentence is six months. If the court imposes a sentence of more than one year... ...the teacher will automatically lose his position as a civil servant. So he'll have to find a different occupation? Yes. He's coming! Quick! Quiet! Good morning, Principal. Good morning. Please be seated. Dr. Mallinger, your science teacher, will never teach this class again. He was found dead in his apartment this morning. I know you must be as devastated as we teachers are. Even more so since the police have determined... ...that it was clearly a suicide. The suicide of a man who was known for his impeccable conduct. Please remember Dr. Mallinger as an honorable man. Thank you. Yes, Principal. The foolishness of some minors has driven a teacher to suicide. The minor child, a taboo in our society. Why? Maybe because we adults need an excuse for our own sense of guilt. The innocence of the child. But how innocent is a child who hides behind her innocence? The people concerned in this case are students in a village school. I always thought it came out in the back with girls. - Pepe! - Old Huber is here. Come here! - What are you doing? - Nothing, Father. - But you were up to something! - Not me, nor Hansi. - But Zenzi was. - And what was she doing? Pee-pee. - And what were you doing? - Watching her. You damn brat. What's wrong with that? We watch the cows all the time, and they piss a lot more than she does. The age of discovering one's own body. Innocent games. Do you always have to be naked to do this? I think so. If you squeeze too hard, it hurts. - Take off your pants. - You first. No, you first. Funny, you're getting goose bumps. I feel it down to my toes. See how hard your nipple is. Do you also touch yourself? Mother says only pigs do that. Your father touches her breasts too. That's all right. That's why they're married. Look. This is nice. It's getting really hard... ...hard like cement, my older brother says. It's supposed to feel really good... ...if you stick it in a girl's hole. Some girls like it so much they scream. If you do it slowly, it tickles quite nicely. How do you know? I've played around down there. That's nice, really nice. What's this down there? My balls. - They're hard. - My hard balls. It's nice how you do that. I'm about to come. Something's coming up for me. That's the juice. That's where babies come from. Do you want to do it? You're beautiful. Nice tits. You don't need these. My heart is beating like crazy. What do you call your thing? My mother used to call mine a "ding-dong." Vulgar people call it a cock. My mother always told me to keep my pussy clean. And never to let anyone touch my breasts. Beautiful breasts. Does that feel good? - It's a crazy feeling. - Same here. My ding-dong gets bigger when I touch you. Nice pussy... good pussy. Stand still. I've always wanted to look at a girl like this, with the breasts... ...the pussy and the ass. I've always liked that. As a man, I could just eat you up. - Let me do it a bit. - Yeah. I'll put mine in yours. - That's thin. - That's not it. That's the straw. This is it! What are you doing now, you brat? What are you looking at? I always get spanked when somebody else is doing it. - What are they doing? - They're fucking. What are you doing? You damn pigs! You whores, pigs, doing it in the barn! We were only trying out what we saw in a magazine. A magazine? I'll show you. I'll report you. When should a girl be told about the facts of life? At 12. As early as possible. - When were you told? - At 13. Twelve or 13. - Do you think that's the right age? - No. It should be done sooner. - How much sooner? - Depends. At nine or 10. - At nine or 10 years old? - Yeah. How did you learn, at school or from your parents? No, from friends. Did you learn about it from your parents, at school, or from friends? My friends, playing doctor and touching each other. Dr. Hollmann: "Psychologist" You're a psychologist at the youth office. You dealt with this case. What is your opinion? For me, it's wrong to call the events in the barn a "case." A "case" implies a punishable offense... ...and young people exploring their bodies in a barn is hardly an offense. So you think the young people in the barn acted correctly. Why? According to our basic human nature, they certainly acted correctly. - Please explain. - It's simple. The child absorbs culture and language through imitation. The same is true of discovering one's sexuality. Then why did the police officer make such a big mistake? Adults tend to be in denial... ...because of moral beliefs and social prejudice. As if a growing child had done something wrong in trying to discover himself. I know my answer is shocking, but that's how it is. The events that transpired in the barn only could have happened... ...because the school teacher had refused to teach the children about sex. If someone is guilty, it's her. Mr. Müller, you are 45 years old and an architect. Do you think that the sexual permissiveness of schoolgirls today... ...is exaggerated in public debate? Yes. Most of what they do, they do in search of adventure. Take the story of Monika and Emi, two runaways. They were students at a rural school. One day they ran away... ...leaving a note for their parents. "Fuck school! We want to be free!" They wrote. - Good day. - Good day. - What can I get you? - Two Bulgarian yogurts. We only have Bavarian, and even that, we don't have. But you have some back there, in the freezer. No, sorry. It's reserved for somebody else. - But I do have some scented cheese. - That'll do. Well, well... Girls like that make my hair stand on end. What? Stop them, those dirty bitches. Stop them. Police! Stop! Stop them! Shoplifters! Dirty bastards. They should be drowned. Here, take this. Over there. No, they went straight ahead. I can't take it anymore. I want to go home. I'll turn myself in. Are you crazy? I thought we wanted to be free. Free, yes, but not like this. Admit it, Monika. You're sick of this too. Come. Munich, on... So... ...first you steal, and now you want to go home. Let's hear it. It wasn't stealing. It was only petty theft. My name is Monika Reinhard. I'm 16. I'm Emilie Stradmann, also 16. We came to Munich, where the action is. You go crazy in a small village. We planned to stay with a friend... ...but we'd lost her address. And she doesn't have a phone. Well, we could have gone to the registry office. But we didn't think of that. So we waited around the train station. And that's where it happened. There must be a place for information around here. Yes, over there. - My suitcase! - What a welcome. My suitcase gone, along with 500 marks in cash. What a mess! We wanted to go to the police... ...but what would you have done? You'd have sent us straight home. That's when we met Uschi... ...and she overheard that we didn't have anywhere to go. She was quite charming. If that's all, you can stay with me. No one has to be homeless in Munich. That's really nice of you. We don't want to impose. No problem. Uschi, as she called herself, had a cute apartment. She wanted us to make ourselves at home. But we didn't want to kick up our heels. So, let's have a drink. You can take a bath if you want. Coming to Munich was a great idea. I have to pop out... ...but a friend will be by and he'll entertain you. And entertain us he did. Man, you can really make stupid mistakes sometimes. He led us on, like stupid rubes from the country. We had no idea about people in big cities. But I wouldn't give in. "I'll show him," I thought to myself. Boy, was I ever wrong. He showed me. Then, he went for Emi. She only wanted to fool around a bit. You didn't have to say that. Why not? It's the truth. People should know you hadn't done it before... ...and that he deflowered you. He did you, just like he did me. What a great guy. I'll never have one like Egon again. I think he could make any girl quite happy. At least that's what I thought that night. But the next morning, he tried to talk us into becoming his prostitutes. We could stay with him forever, he told us. But we didn't want to, so we beat it. We were back on the streets, and he'd stolen Emi's money. So we ended up with the bums. They helped us a lot. So you expressed your gratitude, right? I do have manners. But things got too hot. They knew our parents were looking for us. And you guys have it in for bums. Then Roland took us in. Where did you find these two? Couldn't you find any bigger bores? Stop that nonsense. - Get comfortable. - You got any dough? - What? - He wants to know if you have money. I should have known. - Did you hear about that band? - Man, they're lame. The Anglo-Saxons are playing at the Grotta... ...complete with lesbian organ players... ...two gay guitarists and a transvestite drummer. When they play, they really kick it up. You know, I pictured Munich differently. So are you gonna just sit there and put down roots? In for a penny, in for a pound. By now we knew that guys were only interested in fucking. Maybe it's silly, but that night I thought... ...that marriage is probably no different, with the guy saying, "Come here." No matter if he's drunk or whatever... ...you have to be a good wife and lie down. Don't put them down. They were great people. I'd have loved to stay with Roland. They also gave us these clothes. But after two months... ...they started getting antsy. Someone had told them about "new freedom"and a "new community." And "man's responsibility." They became unbearable. They traded their things in for motorcycles and headed south. They wanted to go to a kibbutz in Israel... ...and when they got tired of that... ...perhaps to Kathmandu, the city in the Himalayas. Over 200,000 young people are said to have gone there last year. Joining the flower children there is supposed to make you a better person. We were in trouble again... ...and sleeping on a construction site is not exactly a dream come true. We were hungry. So we went to that store and used that yogurt trick... ...so that we could get some stuff. And now you want to go back to school, right? Yes. - That is, if they'll take us back. - I think they will. The biggest problem: Immaturity. Boy and girl, both the same age. At 17, she may already be a woman sexually. While he, also 17, acts like a kid sometimes. Hence, the following story... ...deliberately shown in a humorous way. What do you think? Shouldn't we go to the movies instead? That's out of the question. You said we'd go to the woods to make love. Now we're in the woods and we're gonna make love. Promises made to a woman must be kept. You know that you're my first? But you told me you were so experienced. I've got a feeling you won't like me anymore afterwards. I'm really a super guy. That's why I've been looking forward to this. I think it's going take a bit longer. - Making promises you can't keep. - Ha! My cock will be ready soon. Well, I'll be... You're doing well up here, but nothing's going on down there. I'll come over you like a storm. You'll be struck by the lightning bolt of love. You'll see, I'll do you really well. - I don't see anything yet. - I have to build up to it. Well, keep building then. Something's distracting me. But you'll see... ...and my friend down there will take you. And I'll tell you then... then... Hey, our clothes are gone. Hello there! - Give back those clothes! - First things first. You'll get them back after you sing a song. I'm not crazy. Give them back now. But, Heini, start singing or we'll go home naked. Come on. - A little man stands silent in the woods... - Come on. ...wearing a bright crimson coat. Who could that little man be... ...standing all alone in the woods... ...with that little crimson coat? A little man stands silent in the woods... Quick. Wearing a bright crimson coat... Give me a call when you learn how to make love. Bye! Bitch! I almost lost my virginity to that bitch. I'm feeling so limp. Here's Tessie. She just turned 16. She's now beyond the reach of the Protection of Minors Act. She's allowed to be in a pub after 9:00 p.m. when accompanied. She met two young men, who got her drunk. They took her to a party. Just what kind of party it was will shock even you. Come. Stop. Sit down. Okay. Now you'll have lots of fun. - Where are we? - At the gates of heaven. This is the party? Nobody's here. They'll come. They're never on time. You have to stick it in deep. Not too much. I need mine too. Whoever invented this shit should get a medal. - What did you pay for it? - 50. Pretty expensive for a trip. Cheaper than a whorehouse. Should we give her some too? Sure, she's grown-up. So, do you want to try it? What is it? Quite harmless, but it'll make you feel like the eighth day of Christmas. Where are the others? Screw them. They probably got lost or something. Give me your arm. I don't know. Doesn't it hurt? Not a bit. You won't feel a thing. Now a nice tie, like at the doctor's. - She fell for it. - We got her. Put her on the mattress. The stuff won't last long. Gotta work fast. - Wanna do her first? - I'm not a can-opener. Don't take too long. Watching makes me really horny. We can each do her a few times. Man, we got a really hot chick this time. That was great. Let's beat it now. Tessie is one of 12 young students... ...found like this by the police within five weeks... ...raped and drugged. Fred and Charlie always used the same approach. They gave the girls very sweet cocktails... ...so that they couldn't taste the alcohol. Then they lied about a party... ...and pretended to shoot up. In reality, they drugged their victims. The statistics reveal a terrible fact. An alarming number of schoolgirls are addicted. A danger of our modern times. Did you know that one in four schoolgirls in Germany have smoked a joint? I had a feeling. - Have you ever done it? - Yes. - Have you had a joint before? - Yes. Do you think it's right for young people to take drugs? No. We'll have to get much tougher. Do you think girls who do drugs are more sexually active? Certainly, it lowers your inhibitions and lands you in bed. It depends. You have all sorts of feelings when you smoke a joint. - Do you think it's unhealthy? - Yes, I think so. Today's schoolgirls aren't shy when it comes to material benefits... ...as the following case demonstrates. You are Ingeborg Bayer, aged 35, and a housewife. I experienced this with my own 16 year-old daughter. It happens more often than people think. The compulsion to shop... ... drives girls to do things that would leave you speechless. Look. This one looks great. - How much you think it costs? - Don't know. Go and ask. - That's silly. - That's what sales clerks are for. - Go inside. - Why me? Do I want it or you? Well, forget it then. - What do you want with a wig? - It's chic and something new. My mother wants me to have long hair... ...and I can hardly cut it off. She'd love to see me in braids. What crap. If I could just get some money. - Careful, the enemy is listening. - What? The guy at the next table. - What can I get you? - Two chocolate cakes and two coffees. He's interested in us. That's no reason to leave. He's too old for me. I'm going. You can stay. If you leave, I'll go too. I don't have much money. Can you lend me some? I don't have a cent. I was going to ask you. Don't fool around. Check it again. Like reaching into the pocket of a naked man. This one's on me, ladies. - Out of the question. - Who do you think we are? Two very pretty girls. Anyone can run out of money. He's right. - But only if we can repay you. - If you insist. Jasper? Is that your first or last name? A pseudonym. Photo studio? Are you a photographer? Can't deny it. Do you do things like nude pictures and stuff? Yes, nude and stuff. For the magazines? If the models are as beautiful as you two. - And you get money for this? - Yes, that's right. - Why, are you interested? - Me? Not on your life. - Why would I? - Why did you come then? I was thinking of a head shot or something. There are magazines that print photos like that. With 5 million girls in Germany and 500 million in the world... ...you think you're the only one? Let's see what we have here. I thought so. What? Nothing more than another head shot. What do you mean? - You don't have it. - Only my head? - Listen, I have a great body. - Really? I haven't seen it. You'll have to show me more. Quite nice. But only from behind. Why only from behind? You have sagging breasts? Sagging breasts? You have to cover some girls up with a towel. - Not me. - There you go. You've got nothing to hide. On the contrary! You've got beautiful breasts. Step into the light. That's good. - No, that doesn't work. - Why not? It looks dirty with the panties. I won't take them off. That's a problem. Half-dressed is porn, only total nudity is natural. Forget it. Get dressed. Don't you want to take a picture of me like this? No, it's not worth it. - Not even if l... - If you what? - If I take them off? - Well, take them off then. - You have to turn around. - I'm not in love with you. I see so much flesh every day that I'd rather have pasta. There you go. That's going to be great. That's good. Fantastic. Yes. Now look right here. Take a breath. Beautiful eyes. Slender neck. Now the eyes. Let's be creative. That's gonna be great. Now a little bit distant. Now look here. Now the calm after the storm. Come. Look. I have to tell you something. Look at the picture. A wig? Did you let him take pictures? - What is it to you? - You... - Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning, Mr. Taschner. Can I help you? Hello. Now I've come here. And what do you want? I also want to earn money for a wig. Just like Margot. Well, let's see. I'm just as pretty as Margot, and slimmer. My pictures should be great. They tell me I've got today's look. You aren't wearing panties. No, I figured they'd have to come off anyway. - What's your name? - Jutta. Do you like me? - Good morning, Mr. Taschner. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hello. - Good morning, Mr. Taschner. - But... What's going on with the girls? Their tits are real, but their hair is fake. I'll be darned. If I didn't know for a fact that these were Swedish porn models... ...I'd swear they were some of our girls. But our schoolgirls are innocent. I'd swear it with my hand in the fire. Would you pose for nude pictures? Possibly. In private. - Have you done it before? - Yes. - How old are you? - 18. Would you pose for nude pictures? Why not? I have a nice body. Yes. I haven't done it, but I would if it paid well. - Do you have nude photos of yourself? - Yes. Do you have nude photos of yourself? Yes, but I can't show them, they're too risqué. Do you think the pornography ban should be lifted? Yes, when you're 18, you can do what you want. No. Everyone should know what's right. It should be lifted. The more you ban something, the more people do it. There are already a lot of illegal imports, so why not? Should they lift all restrictions, or leave some, like an age limit of 18? Yes, there should be restrictions. But not at 18, at 16. Yes, an age restriction, 16 or 18. No. Young girls should work or study... ...and not waste their time with that filth. - Does porn excite you? - No. - Does porn excite you? - No. Yes, but if it puts me in the mood... ...I'd rather masturbate than jump into bed with a man. How easy or difficult is it for young girls today? They can find objective information on their problems. I met this girl in a sex shop. But what does she learn here? She's faced with technical tools that her parents might enjoy. But this young girl doesn't need things like that. On the contrary, they would make her relationships more difficult. - Do you fancy that? - I find it quite funny. - Would you buy it? - No, I'm just looking. Does that sexually excite you? You and your questions. Honestly, not much. - How old are you? - Guess. - Eighteen. - Thank you. I'm 15 and a half. Would you tell me about the first time you had sexual contact? As a child, playing doctor, or do you mean the real thing? The real thing. - Half a year ago. - When you were 15. - Yes, do you think that's late? - No, no. Can you tell me about it? - But it's an unusual story. - Even better. I'm in high school, 10th grade. Half a year ago, I was a virgin. I wasn't interested at all. Silly, eh? Why? You're still young. Everyone's different. I felt really silly. The girls in my class had all had sex. Or at least they'd done petting, they said. Mondays were really bad. The stories they'd tell. How, where and with whom they'd done it on the weekend. I couldn't stand it. - He's got a great way. - You're putting us on. - Do him, then you'll know. - I don't fuck just anyone. You're funny. How else could you make comparisons? - I never let one slip through my fingers. - I need one every day. I need one who can do me several times. Well, let me have him, and we'll see how often I come. We'll all see. Two days later I'd forgotten what I'd said. I said I'd give up my virginity to that guy. Surely my classmates were all talk as well. Pass it on to Elke. THE STUD SAYS YES Pass it on to Elke. Elke, give me that note. Give it to me. Stand up. As a teacher, I can't reach into your blouse. As a man, however, I can. As a student, I can't do this. But as a girl, I can. That's what you'd call getting even, right? Carry on. Saturday night, it happened. Gitte had actually organized a party. And the stud showed up? Yes. His name was Günter. Not as ugly as I'd thought. Still, I felt silly for having to give up my virginity... ...just because of my bragging. Have a drink first, Günter. Courtesy of my dad. To his health. Where is he? He and mom took off, saying it'd be too loud for them here. Then, let's get started. Horst, stop smooching and put on some music. Everyone knew I'd be the one tonight. And everyone else had already done him. I wanted to leave, but if I left... ...I would have been finished at school. Well, how do you like him? Can't say yet. I'll find out once we're in bed. I could have slapped myself. Once again I'd said something totally different from what I was really thinking. I felt sick. Was it anxiety or... Chris, did you put something in my drink? - What makes you think that? - I'm feeling sick. If you want to back out... Me? Back out? I must be hearing things. I'll take him with my eyes closed. He took me back to his room. I was hoping that the others hadn't told him I was a sly one. If he found out that I'd never... And if he told then others... Come in, take off your coat. - You want something to drink? - What have you got? I've got some whiskey somewhere. Would you like some? No, I'd rather not. Let's cut to the chase. What? Come on. That's why we're here, right? Okay. Have it your way. Can't you turn off the lights at least? Damn it! Haven't you ever seen a naked girl before? Yeah, sure... but not often. But I thought you were the town stud. That's crap. Gitte made that up to trick you. What? Trick me? - What are you doing? - I'm getting dressed. - What a waste. - Says who? Don't touch me. I may not be the town stud, but I'm no fool either. And then it happened. He was no stud. Thank God he was no stud. He was a really sweet guy, inexperienced like me. You should have told me you were a virgin. I'm not anymore. That was it. Disappointed? No. Why? And the other girls? We told them quite a story the next morning. - By the way... - Yes? They were wild themselves that night. Gitte told me so. - This is lame. - Why didn't you invite more guys? I've got an idea. This could be the idea of the century. - What's your idea? - Don't keep us in suspense. Well, get ready for your surprise. But you have to play along. - I'd take anyone tonight. - You won't find anyone now. Is this the cab company? Could you send a car to Brunnstrasse 11? Thank you. How long? Five minutes. Great. I'm sorry, there's been a mistake. I'll give you your two marks outside. If he walks past a cemetery, the maggots will eat him up. Don't panic. I'll call another one. So, ladies, where do you want to go? Well, the thing is, we're looking for a nude model. - No. - Yes, a real male model. And nude. We're budding artists, painters, you know? We need to do more studies... - ...on a live subject. - Totally naked? I get off my shift at 12:30. You could make a bundle right now. Not much going on at this hour. - No, it's busy... - Isn't it comfortable here? Yeah, but... ...a hundred at least. Agreed. Go into the next room and take your clothes off. Well... - What now? - I can't paint. You don't need to. Everyone got a pad? - Are you ready? - Yes. Then come on out. You know what? Stand right there, the light is good. - But drop the towel. - Yeah. We didn't hire you for the towel. Okay. If you insist. Come, girls. Let's console him. Get undressed! That's what I call recreation. - Can he take all four of us? - The way he's built? Come on. The new way to health and beauty. Let me go. Don't pull on it, that hurts! Dispatch. Car 19 here. No, I'm still booked. But send three more, I need help. No, no police. It's personal help I need. Three drivers. Young... ...and strong! When should a girl have her first sexual contact? When she's found the right boy. - It doesn't depend on her age? - No, if she's ready. When should a girl have her first sexual contact? At 16, when she realizes masturbation doesn't work... ...and real intercourse is the best solution. Did you have sex for the first time because your boyfriend demanded it? Yes, because if I'd said no, there'd have been a hundred others. What was your reason for having sex the first time? The reason? It was the boy. He was nice, and I liked him. I was interested in him... ...and had no concerns about sleeping with him. What was your reason for having sex the first time? I was drunk, but I really enjoyed it. Did you enjoy it? The first time, no. But later, I couldn't hold myself back. Do you think a girl should be a virgin when she gets married? No. Why? No, that's not important today. In fact, men actually like experienced women. The responses to our survey clearly show... ...that girls who are still virgins do not feel better morally. Quite the contrary is true. What used to be known as one's sexual honor... ...is being denounced today. Just how questionable certain laws for the protection of minors can be... ...is documented by this case. It was recently in the press, and I followed it closely. We've changed the names to protect the individuals. - Your name is Susanne Liphold? - Yeah. - You're 15 and a student. - Yes. I graduate next year. You're father is a civil servant. Yes, with internal revenue. My mother doesn't work. Susanne, you know why you're here today. You've had some very unpleasant experiences. I'd like to help you deal with them. - You must trust me. - Yeah. But you must help me too. That is, you must tell the truth. - Are you ready? - Yes. Be honest. When was the first time you had sex? I was 14 and a half. For once, my parents had allowed me to go to a party... ...at a friend's place, and... And? There was a bank trainee. He was almost 19. He took me with him. Took you where? To his place. Quiet or you'll wake my mother. Too late. - Who's that? - Susanne, she lost her key. And you're the cavalier who offered to let her sleep here. Well, you know what you're doing. I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything. Tomorrow morning the kid's out of here, you hear? - Then it happened. - Did you like it? Like it? I didn't feel anything. No orgasm. - Never did. - What do you mean? I was with two others after that. One was older. I'd met him at a café. - The other one was from school. - And no orgasm? - I don't even know what that was. - Why do it then? That's the crazy thing. I love to excite men. - Excite how? - When I show them my body. Did you see them often? Often? Again and again. Again and again... ...and again... ...and again... And again nothing. How are you doing in school? In the top half, I think. I like German and history. Math is my weakness. That's the problem. Problem? With Mr. Doderer. After my brother and sister got married... ...and moved out of the house... ...the house was really empty. So my parents rented a room to Mr. Doderer, an actuary. He could tutor Susanne. A mathematician in the house. Then we'd have to give him a discount on the rent. So what? We need to make sure Susie keeps up at school. You say it like I was a bad student. - Only in math. - Very important in life. I'll talk with Mr. Doderer. He's a solid individual. That's how things started with Mr. Doderer. Please have a seat, Susanne. Let's see how advanced you are. My parents wanted a mathematician... ...and they drove me into his arms. Of course, I wanted to impress him too. Is your room always this hot? I can't stand it. Let's start. I played with him like a cat plays with a mouse. He focused on math, and I wanted to get him. I excited him so much he almost fainted. One day, with my parents gone... ...the big moment came. I knew when he usually went into the bathroom. It was easy. Sorry. Oh, it's you. Come in, I'm almost done. If you'll do my back, I'll be done even sooner. He shouldn't have done that. Now, I had to have him, no matter what. Yes? Why did you leave? Never heard of Susanne in the tub? I expected him to throw me out, to beat me. Men are said to react like this when they get too excited. That was the first time I came. And he had probably never done it so often with anyone before me. He was in a world of his own, and I wanted more and more. In short, I drifted off into a world of my own, too. How embarrassing. You... You damned... ...child molester! Susanne! That's it. Unfortunately, that isn't it. The father believed his innocent daughter had been the victim of a child molester. He reported him to the police. The accused lived with you for over a year. He must have known you weren't 16 yet. - Yes, but... - But what? You mean he didn't use force. No, no force. That's the nature of seduction. Otherwise, it would be rape. Let's say, even if you hadn't done anything... ...the charges would still be justified. - Do you understand? - No. It's irrelevant anyway. An important question: Did the accused have intercourse with you... ...or was it oral or manual only? Let me rephrase. Did the accused insert his penis into your vagina? Yes. I didn't hear you. Speak up. Yes. And justice was being done. Parents who wanted punishment for an alleged injustice... ...ended up causing an even bigger one. "Anyone who has intercourse with a minor... ...shall be imprisoned for up to one year. It does not matter whether the behavior of the minor... ...contributed to or furthered the criminal actions or not." Based on the evidence, the facts are clear. - Questions from the public prosecutor? - No, thank you. - The second prosecutor? - No questions. - Questions from the defense? - Yes I have, Your Honor. Susanne, did you have intercourse with other men besides the accused? I must object! Why are you torturing her like this? She's only 15. I'm aware of that. But I'm questioning the witness, not you. You bastard! That's slander. - Quiet please. - Well, Susanne? A terribly awkward situation. What can I do? If I say no, he goes to jail. If I say yes, my parents will think I'm a whore. Susanne, you're a witness. You're too young to be sworn in. Nevertheless, you must tell the truth. If you don't tell the truth, or if you conceal anything... ...you'll face serious penalties. Have you had intercourse with other men? - Yes. - That's a lie. Please, Mr. Lippert. - How many? - Three. Besides the accused, you slept with three men. Yes. Susanne, you therefore admit... ...that you had intercourse with four different men... ...including the accused. - How often? - You're going too far. How can you ask these questions with her parents present? We are in court. I did not bring the charges against my client. I'm here to defend him. I must ask you to stop interrupting me. - How often? - I don't know. - Give us an approximation. - I didn't count. Twice, three times? Four times? Or 20, 30 or 40 times? - Yes, maybe 40 times. - Oh, God. I think that's all. Section 182 of the Criminal Code states: Anyone who has intercourse with an innocent minor, etc. According to her own testimony... ...there is no doubt that this girl... ...is not an innocent minor as covered under the Criminal Code. Therefore, the accused must be acquitted. I want their names. Their names! Tell me their names. I'll put them all in jail. Take it easy, Hermann. Don't work yourself up so. I've seen what results are achieved by your upbringing. There. You've created a whore no one wants to touch! I made a fool of myself believing in my daughter's innocence. And I have to pay the court fees. But I'll show you. I'll put you into reform school. They'll teach you about morals! I don't ever want to see you again! Get out! Go to your room. Father will calm down. Protecting her, eh? Women! She's gone. What if she hurts herself? What whore hurts herself? She's in the attic. Susanne! Susanne! That's all I remember. When I came to, I was at the hospital. My father has been very nice to me since then. The discrepancy between today's reality, and the outdated laws... ...is of little interest to the courts. With an almost perverse fervor... ...the authorities investigate the sexual behavior of girls between 14 and 16. The consequences are neuroses and other mental defects. And they are far more detrimental than any sexual contact at that age. Do you think schoolgirls today are worse than in the past? Why worse? We live in modern times. No, certainly not. Worse? No, why should they be worse? Because they have more freedom. More freedom? No, I don't think so. They do the same as we did. Do you think that this freedom is worse? It depends. Freedom is not for everyone, but it's good for most of them. Times have changed, and so have morals. Even if they have sexual encounters sooner... ...they're still quite romantic. And now for the last case I'd like to present to you. It was sent in by Mr. Otto Langenbauer. 45 years old, married, commercial clerk. This case is a refreshing contrast to the other cases we've seen here today. It shows that not all parents insist on outdated moral norms. Rather, some are understanding and use common sense. It's the case of Barbara Martin. There. Now stay in bed and get some rest. It's not serious. You'll be well soon. - Doctor, what's wrong with her? - Just a case of nerves. Nothing serious in her condition. I don't get it. Babsie and nerves? Her condition? You mean... Your daughter is pregnant. Oh, God. What will my husband say? I can't breathe. This happening to us? In the past, kids were just brats. But today the brats are having kids. Bad jokes won't help. What are we going to do? Don't patronize me. I'm desperate. Think of your liver. Forget about my liver, Helga. It's about our Barbara. She's barely 18 and having a baby. It's immoral. - May I come in? - It's you! Now Paul... This concerns me too. What were you thinking? Not much, I tell you. Otherwise, this wouldn't have happened. But that doesn't help now. We have to get through this. Get through this! Get through this! Would you be so kind as to tell me who the father is? - You don't know him. - No? At least you know him. When are you going to get married? Get married? Papa, that's impossible. Horst is still in school, and I haven't told him yet. Great. But you won't marry him? A baby is no reason to get married today. We don't know if we're right for each other. You should have thought of that first. No sense of responsibility. But that's today's youth. The youth are always today's youth. Have you forgotten? Cut that out. Now's not the time. What about school? They'll expel you. And you can forget about going to college. Senseless! The school won't make any trouble. They're not as harsh as they were just because you're expecting a child. Good God, expecting a child. And you say it like it didn't mean a thing. It's already happened. I can't change it. As for Horst and I, the future will tell. The future? That's outrageous. I'm barely 40, and you're making a grandfather out of me. Can't you take pills if you want to fuck... Paul! Sorry. - When are you due? - In seven months. Seven months. Terrible! Don't think I'll be your babysitter. I think she wants to drink. She's already had more than enough. - She's taking after your father. - Thank God for that. I think I need a drink now. They're beautiful. - This is Horst. - The father of the child. Horst Heinmann, yes. We've met. As for me, we never should have met. Paul. Don't start that again. - Do you want a little drink? - Sure, make it a double. Here you go. By the way, many thanks. I had the birth entered into your family register. - And acknowledged paternity. - Yes, that too. I had a look at your register. So? You have no reason to complain about Barbara and me. Barbara was born a year before you were married. Well, you don't have to do everything I did. Cheers. Does that mean... Yes, Babsie. Many things you think you've invented already existed long before. Just ask your Papa. Hush, she's sleeping. - I'm lost in biology. - Have Babsie explain it to you. She's lost herself. - Hi, guys. - Hi. - How's your baby? - I wish I were in her shoes. At least she doesn't have to go to school like her mother. - That's right. - Are your parents okay now? I think they were never really mad. They're reasonable. If this had happened to me, my father would've killed me. My father too. Nonsense. Parents aren't as bad as they seem sometimes. I don't know. There's all kinds. The schoolgirls of today. They're both realistic and romantic. They want a new objectivity... ...and call themselves the Generation of Hot Hearts. Are they bad, or is it ourselves who make them seem bad? What their parents don't think is possible... ...may simply be what they don't want to see... ...or can't see.
