- Elle Rose: My name is Elle Rose Hart, and I want to tell you the story of how I fell in love accidentally, with my best friend.$ (upbeat music) Oh, that's me right there, Elle Rose.$ And here comes my best friend, Carter.$ He thinks he is so fine. He's alright. Anyways, we are both software engineers $ and we are both so good at what we do $ that we can only compete with each other for the $ contracts that we're after.$ (upbeat music)$ And even though we are both bossing in every $ aspect of our lives, we are failing miserably when it $ comes to love, albeit Carter is doing a little better $ than me because he is about to get married. $ No, not to me, to someone else.$ But let me just tell you the story about how $ we fell in love. $ (phone rings) Hello? - LDX just signed with me. - Okay, so are you joking or are you joking? That's a $10 million dollar contract. - The ink on that check is drying as we speak. - I hate you, okay? I hate you. - I expected something more along the lines of, Carter, we're so proud of you. Or, Carter, you're gonna be the next billionaire in our family. Or something along those lines, something a little more encouraging, please? (upbeat music) (blows kiss) Love you, sis. (upbeat music) (keys typing) (phone rings) - Hello? Shecre, what do you mean you're gonna be late? What? No, you do this every... You know what, don't even worry about it. I'm coming, I'm on the way. Yeah, I know but I'm on the way. Whatever. (sighs) Oh my God. (upbeat music) - You are crazy. - But ain't I telling the truth tho? - Charlene: Girl, I'm not messing with you today. - Ooh, Charlene. Look at your fine as wine fianc√©e done walked up in here. Girl, you better get him before I bite him. Mm. - Hey beautiful. - Wassup? - I got some good news. - Which is? - Let's talk. - Wait, I gotta finish my client. - Get somebody to finish her. Please? - Carter. - Please. - Charlene: Moriah, I just need to finish her edges. You got me? - I got you girl. - She got you. I heard it. Thanks, you're the best. Carter: Hey, it's always good news. (playful music) - Shecre: Don't rush me. You know I hate when you rush me. You cannot rush perfection. - Well, if someone wasn't running late, we wouldn't be rushing, now would we? - Girl, bye. You don't pay me enough to be on time. - Keep testing me, Shecre. - I'm just saying. - How'd your audition go? - It went okay. It went well. I did my best. We'll see if they call me back and see if I got the role. - Okay. - And how are things going for you? - So you're talking about Joseph? - Who else would I be talking about? - Joseph is at home with his wife and kids like he should be. And I just wished I would've seen the signs before I let him get that close. - Unh unh. Unh unh. You saw the signs, you just chose to ignore them. - Okay. - Come on, sis. - Okay, okay. Maybe I did see the signs, maybe I did choose to ignore them, but... Girl, look at us. Every weekend, we're setting up wedding cake for someone else's special day. When is it going to be our turn? We can't even keep a man, let alone marry one. - Shecre: Oh! (R&B music) - Is this what you brought me back here for? - No, I actually have some good news for you. I signed the contract. - With LDX? Get out of here, seriously? - Seriously, sweetheart. They said we don't even want to see anybody else. We want to sign with you. - Honey, I am so proud of you. (kissing) Charlene: Wait, wait, just wait. Just wait. - Baby, I don't wanna wait. - Carter. - Come on, why you doing this to me? Doesn't a multi-million dollar contract get you just a little bit ready for me? - We've already talked about this and I want to wait until we are married. - We've done it multiple times. And it was good, you remember? - Yes, it was great. But I don't want our relationship based on sex. - It's not. We've already waited 14 hours, 5 months, 37 days, 37, 38, 39 seconds. Baby, I'm on fire for you. - Our wedding is two weeks away. - That's 14 days. - I know. And in 14 days, you can have all of me. - You know I've never done this before, waited. - You've told me multiple times. (frustrated sigh) - Okay, dinner tonight? (sighs) I love you woman. - Speak for yourself! - Meaning? - Meaning, I don't wanna get married. At least not any time soon. - So you don't wanna have children? - Girl, yeah, one day. But I'm not rushing to the labor and delivery room. - Well, honey, you should be because our maternal clock is ticking girl. - Oh! Look, I don't see where children fit in my life, and honestly, I don't see where they fit in yours either. Your life is work. - Well, you know what? I'm ready for that next chapter in my life. - Girl, write it. Ooh! (playful music) I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hey. (playful music) - Nasty. - Hater. (playful music) - Hey. - Hey, wassup? - You know that new salon they built over there off Jonesboro? - What about it? - Well, I applied yesterday and I think I got the job. - Well, good for you. Does Charlene know? - No, but there's a lot Charlene doesn't know. - Look, uh, Keisha... I don't smoke anymore. - So I see a lot has changed. - Mm, you could say that. - Well, I stopped smoking too. - I held off for about 3 months, but I guess your change is a lot more lasting, huh? - Have a good afternoon, Keisha. - You have a better one. - Yes, Rebekah. - I wanted to let you know that your 3 o'clock is here. - Elle Rose: My 3 o'clock? - Yes, your consultation with Don Coley. - Oh. I forgot about that. - Okay, do you want to reschedule? - You know what, it's fine. Just send him in. - Okay. - Thanks Rebekah. - Hey. Elle Rose Hart. - Dr. Donald Coley but just call me Don. - Dr. Donald Coley but just call me Don. - Okay, so, please have a seat. - Okay, so, please have a seat. So, how can I assist you today, Dr. Coley? - Don. - Don. - So I'm a neurosurgeon actually and I work with doctors... - Elle Rose: Mm, mm, mm. - and we communicate via - Elle Rose: Oh my God - Elle Rose: Is that his mouth speaking or his muscles? Focus, Elle Rose. Uh, you know what, let me stop you right there. - No, no, no, just hear me out first. - There's nothing to hear. My company doesn't deal with healthcare software. - You're not even giving it a chance. - The insurance needed for these projects is astronomical and in the case of legal issues it's nightmarish, so, it's a no. - Will you at least think about it? - Honestly, no. - So I'm wasting my time? - Unfortunately, yes. - You're brutally honest. I like that about you. - Okay, so, Dr. Coley, I wish I could've been of more assistance and thank you for your time. - This is my card. In case you change your mind. Have a good day Ms. Hart. - You have a wonderful day as well, Dr. Coley. Yes, this is Elle Rose Hart. (gentle music) You weren't wearing a ring today when I saw you. Joseph wasn't wearing a ring either when I met him but he was still married. - Well, ask me if I'm married. - Are you? - Call and ask me. - I like how your arms feel around me. Hold me tighter. - Like this? (slow music) - What are you doing? (record scratches) You need serious, serious help. Look, my therapist is awesome. (door shuts) - Ellle Rose: Why were you sneaking up on me anyway? - I didn't sneak up on you. I called your name three times and you didn't answer. - I met a guy. - Don't you think you need to take a little bit more time between you and Joshua? - Joseph, his name is Joseph, and I'm not dating this guy. We're not even talking. He came into my office today, he left a business card, and when we shook hands, and Carter, when we shook hands, I felt something. Whoo! - You know it's dangerous to mix business and pleasure. - I'm not mixing business with pleasure. - He wants me to work on healthcare software. - You have the insurance for that? - Absolutely not which is the very reason why I will not be working on this project with him. - Well, maybe you should get the insurance for it. Artificial intelligence is a lucrative industry. - And you and I both saw exactly what happened with the Brinks firm, what those attorneys did, sucked every coin out of them, and their software had serious confidentiality leaks. - We're smart enough not to make those same mistakes. - So you are considering going into healthcare software? - I am highly considering it. - Ah-ha! You're a madman. (phone rings) You're crazy. - Scared money don't make money. - You're insane. You're self-sabotaging, you're all of that. - (chuckles) Keep on with the insults. - Hello? Yes, this is Elle Rose Hart. Oh, wow, okay. Yes, yes, I'm very interested. Mm-hmm. Okay, yes, I will be available that day. Mm-hm, mm-hmm. (whispers) Carter, Carter, it's the governor's secretary. Yes, I'm still here. Okay, yeah. Okay, I got it, chocolate, red velvet, vanilla, uh-huh. And what's a good day for you? Got it. A good time? Got it. Great, so I will meet with you this weekend for a tasting. Mm-hmm. Okay, no, no, no, thank you for this opportunity. Okay. You take care, bye. Carter! Oh my God. That was the governor's secretary. They were calling because they want me to make cupcakes for the governor's banquet. Oh my God. (singing) They like my product, yeah, they like my cupcakes, yeah, I am the bomb, yeah. Go Elle Rose, go Elle Rose, go, go, go Elle Rose. Are you proud of me, Carter? (phone rings) You're not? Oh, that's so kind of you. Hey Dad, wassup? Oh God, what's wrong, what's going on? Okay. Okay, uhm... Okay, Dad, calm down. Okay, me and Carter, we're gonna be right behind you. We're leaving now, okay? I love you. Carter, we gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. (sad music) - How is she? - Ellison: How's my mom? - Is she okay? - We have stabilized her condition. - So what's wrong with her, doc? - Her blood wasn't properly oxygenated which caused her to become unconscious. Blood pressure was high enough to cause a stroke, but luckily, we caught her in time. - But grandma looked much darker than she really is, and her entire body looked swollen. - From fluid, but we've taken care of the problem and she's resting now. We'd like to keep her until her oxygen level is higher and we're sure that no blood clots form. - Okay, but what caused her blood to become under oxygenated in the first place? - The patient has not given consent for the release of certain information. - Hold on, what do you mean patient hasn't given consent for release of? Man, that is my mother in there. - Dad, dad! - No, look, I got a right to know what the hell is going on. - Dad! Stop. - Mr. Hart, I understand your frustration yet I cannot release her health history as it would be a violation of the patient's right of confidentiality. What you could do is discuss the issue with the patient. - Well, can I at least see my mother? Can you authorize that, doc? - Dad, stop it! Calm down. - You can definitely see your mother, Mr. Hart. But at her request she has asked to see a Ms. Elle Rose Hart. Come with me and my nurse will lead you to her room. After that, you may all see her one at a time as Mrs. Hart allows. - Dad, grandma's gonna be fine, okay? God's got this. - Evan: Come on, Pops. (sad music) - Elle Rose: Grandma has cancer. (Elle Rose cries) - Carter: No, no, it'll be alright. (sad music) - I saw that video and I didn't think it was funny. I didn't see the humor in it. - That kid is funny. You know what, I saw him in standup once. Maybe he's just funnier live in person. I'll get us some tickets. - Save your money. I don't wanna see it. But on another note, how's Gee Gee? - Gee Gee, she's okay. I'm gonna go see her after this. - Well, me and the girls are leaving tonight at 7:30 for the bachelorette party. You sure Elle Rose doesn't want to go? - I doubt she'll be able to make it. She's been stressing out all week over beta testing for her new software. Do you know that she signed a million dollar contract last week? - Did she really? Wow, that's amazing. - She's amazing. - She's not your blood sister, right? - No, we've been through this before. We grew up as neighbors, I was a latchkey kid and her grandma and her dad kinda took me under their wing. - So you two never had sex? - Good morning. - Good morning, Keish. - Keisha: Good morning. - Look, I... Look, Elle Rose is my sister. I don't even look at her that way. - Really? - Wait, are you insinuating something? - I'm not trying to insinuate anything. - I just saw how you hugged her that day in the hospital. That was a lot of love. - I do love her, it's just in a different way. - Good morning, ladies. Carter. - Keisha: Good morning. - I know you want to talk but let's talk outside. Let's... - No, let's not. I just, if she's your sister, I can respect that. - Okay, well, can you? - I trust you. You've never given me a reason not to. - And I never will. Come here. (Keisha coughs) (cough continues) - Are you okay? - Some things just get stuck in my throat. - I gotta go to work. I gotta go to work. (R&B music) - Call me later. (R&B music) - Do you have an appointment? - No? - You have a client here who wants to see you? Should I... - Well, who is it? - Dr. Don Coley. - Okay. Well, give me a few minutes and you can send him in. - Okay. I can't wait no more, can't wait no more Sick of trying, that's why I'm always hiding Cause I complicate my goals, soul surrender, that's why I remember It's the simple things in life, simple things Either it does or doesn't feel right It's the simple things in life Come on baby, let's ride (upbeat music) - Hey, Dr. Don, what a pleasure to see you again. - Ms. Hart. - Elle Rose. - Elle Rose, Elle Rose. - Okay, so, I usually meet with clients by appointment only. - So, what makes me the exception? - Well, we've been considering your proposition. - And? - And, well, we're not ready to take on your project just yet, but we are considering coming on board. - Do you need more encouragement? Because if that's the case, I would love to encourage you over dinner. - You know what, I think I do. - Yeah? - I think I do need more encouragement. - You do? - Yeah. - You still have my business cards? - Yeah. - Good. Well, my numbers are on there, so whenever you're ready, call me and I'll make myself available. - Okay, I will do that, Dr. Don. (upbeat music) - Have a good day, Ms. Hart. I can't wait no more, can't wait no more Sick of trying, that's why I'm always smiling Cause I complicate my goals, - Bye. that's why I remember It's the simple things in life, simple things Either it does or doesn't feel right It's the simple things in life Come on baby, let's ride (upbeat music) It's the simple things in life So? - Shecre: Mm. It's the simple things in life. I can't wait no more, can't wait no more Shecre: Next. Sick of trying, that's why I'm always smiling Cause I complicate my goals, Shecre: Ooh, ooh, that's the one. Shecre: Why not? What's wrong with it? - Elle Rose: No. - Come back! - Elle Rose: No. - Girl. Oh my God. It's the simple things in life Come on baby, let's ride - So, what do you think? - Uh, I mean, girl if you like it, I love it. - Ma'am, what are you doing? - I didn't get the role. I didn't get the role. - Shecre. - Shecre: Now, I just wanna be depressed and fat. - Look, Les Brown said it best. It's not over until you win. - I don't wanna be motivated. I wanna be depressed and I wanna be fat. I wanna be fat and depressed, depressed fat, fat depressed, depressed fat. Did you not catch that? Huh? Please tell me, please tell me you don't have that same first date rule, still? - Yeah, I do. I have it. - Hello, it's the 21st century. People have babies on the first date. And by the way, you've got a little lipstick on your tooth right there. Yep, right there. Get it, and got it. And I think you should switch to red. Might help you out with that dress. I'm gonna go and be depressed and be fat. You know what... I'm gon' be real fat. I didn't get the role. (singing) I didn't get the role, I didn't get the role. - It's not over Shecre. - Elle, I didn't get the role. - It's not over. She'll be alright. She said red. I think it looks okay. I'm going on a date! (jazzy music) So, why do you love cutting into people? - Why do you love computer stuff? - I love cracking codes, I love solving problems, I love making life more efficient for people. - I guess you could say we do the same thing, just with a different medium. - Right. - So, you're a doctor and a very handsome one at that. - Thank you. - You have the money, you have the looks, you have the prestige. - And the credit score. - And the credit score, right. So, how are you single? - Do you want an honest answer or a neatly packaged answer? - No, just give it to me straight. Are you gay, are you sexually fluid? - I'm not gay or sexually fluid. Sexually fluid, what does that even mean? - Okay, so it's when your sexual preference change over time based on your present circumstance. - What? - Yeah, yeah. - How do you even know that? - My friend Shecre, she told me about it. - Is she, are you? - Oh, no. No, no, no, no. See, Shecre, she loves penis. She does. I mean, I mean and I love it too. I love penis too. I love pen... No, I don't. I don't. No, no, so I... I don't love penis. Sir, I don't love penis. I don't love it. And so now you think I'm a crazy lady. - So... (both laugh) - Oh my God, I can't believe I said that. Can we get a do-over? Can we just take this from the top, please? Oh my God, let's just start over. Okay, scratch. Start over. My name is Elle Rose Hart. - Got it. Don: We'll save that. - I like a lot, I like a lot about you. I like your style, how you came on to me at the office, all suave. I wasn't even sure if you really liked me or not. - How couldn't I? - Aww. (R&B music) (indistinct conversation) What are you talking about? The penis scene? - Yeah. - Oh, my God. That was so embarrassing. - Looks like you're still recovering from that one. - I am. I really enjoyed myself with you tonight. - You know, I had a beautiful time with you too, Elle Rose. - So no more Ms. Hart? - Can I call you Roses? - No, (chuckles), only my brother calls me that. - Okay. Come here, crazy lady. - Mm, I really like you Don. - I really like you too. You're special. - I bet you say that to all the ladies you date. - So we're dating? - I mean... - Because, I would love to date you. - I don't kiss on the first date. - What about seconds? - Well, we would have to see, wouldn't we? - We can make that happen. - Can we? Well, let's do it. - Let me walk you to your car, Elle Rose. You didn't have to turn me down like that. (both laugh) - Mama Rose: Well, well, well, I didn't hear you two pull up. What a pleasant surprise! - Elle Rose: Grandma, you're looking good. - Oh, thank you baby, you too. - Hey, love. - Oh, hey grandson. How're you doing? - I baked you a chicken casserole. - Thank you, grandson, but I'm not hungry right now. I'll eat some later. And Elle Rose, what about that alcohol? - Grandma, this is not alcohol. This is sparkling grape juice. - You need to live a little dear. - (laughs) Gee Gee, you haven't changed a bit. - Thank you, grandson. - Grandma, I'm sorry I haven't been able to be around as much as I should. Work's been keeping me busy. - That's alright dear, that's alright. Don't worry about work dear because you and Elle Rose, that's all you've ever done is worked, worked, worked, from grade school to grad school. Don't worry, that's alright. - Yes ma'am. - That's just work. - Yes ma'am. - Yeah, I've been trying to convince Roses to come work under me. Look, I think we make a great team together but she's gonna take some more convincing. You think you can help me out? - Oh yes, grandson, I can help you out. - (clears throat) Grandma, save your breath. It'll never happen. - I think you two make a great team. You should consider it. - This casserole is only slightly warm. You want me to throw it in the oven for a little bit? - No thank you dear, I'm not hungry. I don't have much of an appetite. But by the way, how did you get over here? - Carter: I drove. - In that little toy car of yours? - Carter: Yes ma'am, the Corvette. - Oh, well, okay. Let's go, let's go. Oh boy, let's go dear, let's go. - Carter: Oh, oh, oh. Grandma. - Yes dear? - Where're we going? - Grandma: To the airport. I want to ride with the top let back to feel the wind blowing in my hair. - Carter: In your, in your... Okay, you said in your hair? - Grandma: Yeah. - Okay (laughs). Why are we going to the airport? It doesn't matter about the why. We can establish that on our way to our destination. (Carter laughs) - Okay. - Elle Rose: You two have fun. And Cart, this is really good. - Yeah, I know it is. I cooked it. - I lied. It tastes like rotten eggs. - Don't you say that to my grandson. - That's why I nailed the contract today and you didn't. - That's why I'm getting married tomorrow and you're not. (playful music) - That was mean, Carter. That was mean. - No it was not. Don't you talk to my grandson like that. Grandma: Come on grandson, let's go. Grandma: You're my most precious one dear. Carter: I know I am. - I can't believe that you are not having a bachelor's party. - Look, I know myself, I know what I'm capable of. Best bet is for me to go home, get some sleep, wake up tomorrow and go get married. - So what's bothering you? - Gee Gee. - It's something else, I can sense it. Are you nervous? - About the wedding? Of course. Like forever is a long time. - Okay, so cold feet. - I don't know what it is I'm feeling. - Listen, Charlene is a good girl. When you chose her, you chose the cream of the crop. I don't think you have anything to worry about. - I'm worried about me. Is it all out of my system? I don't wanna hurt her. - Have you cheated on her? - No. Not since the proposal. - And before the proposal? - Look, old habits die hard. - (sighs) What did you do? - Swear you won't tell. - Oh my God. I won't say anything. - Well, before we became official, I was sleeping with her employee. - Carter, jeez! What were you thinking? - Look, I didn't know that we would take off the way we did. I didn't know I'd fall in love with her. - Have you told her? - No! How are you supposed to tell somebody something like that? - When things became serious, that's when you should've told her. - Well, I didn't know how. It was awkward. - You should've told her. - Well, it's too late now and now Keisha keeps giving me these lowkey glances and saying all this under-handed stuff. I don't trust her. What if she says something? - It's never too late to tell the truth and I don't think it's a good idea for you to go into this marriage on lies. - Rock, paper, scissors. - For what? - Look, if you win, then I tell her. If I win, then these lips stay zipped. - I'm getting out of this car. - Aye, aye, look, look! Rock, paper, scissors. - This is not a game. - I know it's not a game. But if fate agrees with you that this is something that she should know then I'll do it. - This is too easy. You always do rock the first time. You are predictable. - Two out of three. Best two out of three, let's go. - Cut, cut. - Oh crap. Best three out of five. - I'm, no, I'm not doing this with you, okay? If you wanna tell her, tell her. If not, just keep it hidden. - Why do you say hidden? You make it sound so bad. (phone rings) Who's that? - My doctor friend. - Oh your doctor friend... Doctor Coley makes you smile like that? Roses, it's been a long time since I've seen a man make you smile like that. I need to speak to him. I'll tell you if he's the real deal or not. - How about no? Goodnight, big head. Hey you. (romantic music) - Why aren't you taking pictures? - I like to wait until the place is full first. - How do you know that our bride doesn't want snaps of her guests as they enter the vicinity? - Whatever. - Click, click. Click, click. - Excuse me-- - What? - We have a serious, serious problem. - Planner: How serious is serious? - Like, majorly serious? Possibly irreparably serious. - Let's go. These millennial brides. (suspenseful music) - You did what?! - You told me to tell her. - I didn't tell you to tell her that, I didn't say that. - You forgot rock, paper, scissors already? - Carter, now is not the time to joke. - I don't think it's funny, so I'm not joking. It's not a joke, definitely. - I think you, I think you did this on purpose. Yeah, I think you were looking for a way to mess it all up. - Why would I? Do you know how much money I spent on this wedding? - Okay, well, what did you say? - What do you mean? - What were the words that came out of your mouth? Pretend I'm her, I'm Charlene. Go! - Carter: Okay, hey, fellas, can you just... - Sure, sure. We got you. - Alright. - Let's give them a minute. - Okay, so... Can you put your phone to your ear? It wasn't a face to face conversation. It was done over the phone. - Are you serious? - Just take out your phone and just pretend with me. If we're going to pretend, let's pretend. - So to add insult to injury, you go and break the news that you cheated over the phone. Who does that? What are you... - Okay, look. I didn't cheat, okay? We weren't even serious at the time. I mean, we were serious, we weren't very serious at the time. - Here he go. Oh my God. - We weren't like serious, we were talking serious but we weren't like "I'm gonna be your husband, you're gonna be my wife" forever serious. That level wasn't even reached at the time. - Carter, Carter, stop. This is a joke to you. - I don't have time for it. - Roses. Look, this is very serious to me. - Is it? - Yeah. I just don't know what to do. I don't know where Charlene is, she won't pick up her phone. Sister went over to her house, the car's not there. I don't know, I... And Gee Gee's just... - And Grandma, Grandma is sitting out there waiting to see you get married. (sighs) Oh my God. - Alright, so what do I do? - This is not good. This is not good. So you go out there, you go out there Carter, and you hope to God that she shows up. - And if she doesn't? - Then those are the consequences of your actions that you're just gonna have to deal with. Oh my God, you make me sick! (indistinct chatter) (melancholy music) - Carter: Moriah. - Hi Carter, how are you? - I apologize. - What can I do for you? - You know why I'm here. Just trying to get in touch with Charlene. - I'm sorry, Carter, I haven't heard from her. - That's the same thing every one of her friends have said so far, you know that. - Sorry. Alright Carter. - Excuse me. (melancholy music) (sad music) (ambulance siren) (sad music) - Mama's dead? - They gave her two weeks. They're putting her on hospice (crying). - No! No! (crying and wailing) (sad music) - Carter: Where is Shecre when you need her? - Elle Rose: I didn't tell you? She got cast for that indie film down in Miami. She'll be back this weekend. - Carter: Whoa, who's going to help you set up tomorrow? - You (chuckles). And Don, Don's coming but he's going to be running a little late. - You owe me big time for this. I'm talking about VIP tickets to the next Cowboys games. - I got you, I got you, Carter. I'm just trying to figure out what to get grandma for her birthday. - Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot too. What do you get for the person that you love that's... - Right. - ...dying. What could we give her that she could enjoy for the next two weeks? Wow. - What? - Wow. - What's wow? - Nah, it wouldn't work. - What wouldn't work? You're not saying anything, what are you talking about? Carter, I will take your head clear off your body with this thing if you don't tell me. What are you talking about? - It wouldn't work. - What wouldn't work? You're not saying anything. What? - Okay, look. The perfect gift for her. What would be the perfect gift for Gee Gee? - You married. - And? - And me married too, with a baby in my belly probably. - Exactly. - Okay, so, Carter, I'm not quite following your logic here because your lady is M.I.A, and me and Don, we're entirely too fresh to even consider the idea of... I know you're not thinking what I think you're thinking? Oh my God, no. No, we're not doing that. - Just forget about it. - Yeah, let's forget about it and not bring it up, ever again. Okay, so, what would I tell Don? - You don't need to tell him anything. What for? This isn't real. This is something that we're doing for your grandma to give her a beautiful parting gift. - Carter, grandma is sick, she's not stupid. If it doesn't read real, she's not going to buy it, and the only way she'll buy it is if the family buys it and... - Which is why we need to kiss. - I promise to God, every time you say that, it just starts rising in the back of my throat and it's kinda... - Alright, just forget it alright? Forget it. - Carter, I'm not saying it's a bad idea. It's not a bad idea, it's just, how would we make it real? You know what, Evan. My brother, he can spot a farce from a mile away. If we can get him to buy it, then I'm sure the family would buy it too. - Okay, so that's why we should work this out. - Whoo! Okay, okay. You got it. - Okay so. - Okay, okay, we're just gonna do it, just, okay. - Alright, now that just looks painful. - Carter, please. Come on, like, this is awkward and it's uncomfortable and I'm really trying here but you're not really... No. No, Carter, no, I'm sorry, no. Nope, no, it's not gonna work. It's not gonna work. We tried it and it's not believable and it's... - That's just because you're not giving it a chance to work. - I'm not giving it a chance because it's not working. - Look, please, just relax, follow my lead. - Okay. - And trust me. - Okay. - The reason I couldn't marry Charlene is because I realized I was in love with you. - Is that our lie? - No, that's our truth. - Okay. - That we must believe. And the reason why we couldn't realize that before is because we grew up as brother and sister. And neither one of us ever entertained crossing that line. Until one day, a moment arose that elicited a kiss. And once our lips touched, we both realized there was more between us than we could ever... (knocks on door) (knocks on door) - I really need to go and answer... (knocks on door) - Hey! Don! - Don: Yeah, I tried... (Elle Rose gasps) - Hey. - Don: I tried calling you and you didn't answer the phone. - Yeah, because I was busy. - Don: Busy. - Mm-hmm. - Don: So, you need help with the cupcakes? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Don: Can I come in? - Yeah. - Don: Nice seeing you. - Hey. It's good to see you too. - Are you okay? - Yeah? - Positive? - I mean, just a little headache but... - Okay. Mind if I use your bathroom? - It's down the hallway to the left. - You've got a beautiful place. - Thank you. (toilet flushes) - Okay so, hey, Don, this is my brother Carter, and Carter, this is my friend Don. - Please to meet you sir. I've heard a lot about you. - Likewise. I would shake your hand, but I'm a little preoccupied. - I understand. So Elle, what do you need me to do? - Well, here, you can grab a piper and just jump right on in. - So, you bake too? - No, definitely not. The only reason I'm here is because she kidnapped me. Her friend Shecre is states away. Did you watch the game last night? - That tragedy? That's why I prefer college basketball. Those boys play with heart. - Yeah, that's because they play for the love of the game and not a paycheck. - You can go ahead. - No. - No, Carter. - Excuse me. -No, Carter, it's okay. - Go ahead. - Okay. (jazzy music) - You know you look pretty sexy with those glasses on like that. - Carter, stop. There is no need to pretend. - Well, we can break character now that your man's gone. - Do you like him? - I do. I think if you and I weren't already getting married, that dude would be marriage material. Except I think he can sense that you and I have a thing going on. - Carter, we don't have anything going on. - You probably should stay single until we're done doing what we're gonna do. We've got to stay in character. We can't just keep going in and out. Living a double life is a dangerous thing. Somebody finds out, the gig is up. - You could be right. - I know I'm right. - Okay, then, Mr. Intelligent Man. Since you're so smart why don't you help me with this. - Okay. What am I looking at? - The Surg-Image software. - So you are taking it on? - I mean you could say that. - Okay, so you are mixing business with pleasure after all. - Carter, (chuckles) I think I'm mixing a lot with pleasure right now so. - Okay, but this could actually be a temporary out. You could let him know that you want to put off any type of relationship until this software is developed. Give you some wiggle room. I see why there's so many glitches. Do you see how old this operating system is? - Mm-hmm, yeah, I noticed that. - Move to an IoT. - Yep, move to an IoT with a real-time operating system. - Of course, an IToS, and to cover your bases, you could host the software on a HIPAA-compliant server. - A HIPAA-compliant server. - Yeah, that way you can avoid the development of future bugs, problem solved. - You are brilliant. - Exactly. That's why you're marrying me. That felt real. - It was supposed to, right? - You think that we can fool your brother? - One way to find out. (news music) - Reporter: Good afternoon, everyone. Thunder storms starting to come to life across parts of Durham County, Granville County... - Dad, I understand that, but you also have to be realistic. - I will not be doing it and neither will you. - I'll just pick one out myself. - You will not be ordering a casket for my mom while she yet lives. - She is dying dad. - Shut up. - It's a hard reality but we have to accept it. - Dammit, I said shut up! - Elle Rose: Hey, hey. You two need to stop. Evan, now is not the time to-- - No, Ellie, he needs to hear this. Either he needs to pick out a casket and make the proper arrangements, or sign things over to me so I can take care of business. - I can't with you. - Dad. Dad. - Elle, I can't. - Evan: He tripping. He tripping. - Now is not the time for this, okay? He is hurting! - And I'm not? I'm not, sis? - Evan. - You and Pops can handle it. I need a moment. - Evan! Evan! (melancholy music) Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma, can you hear me? - Yes, and I heard them too. - Grandma, I hate that you had to hear that. - I want y'all to fix me some macaroni cheese, and collard greens and green beans and greens and potato salad and yams that my Carter cooks so well. Some pound cake with some lemon frosting drizzled over it. - Mm, mm, mm. Grandma, you going to eat all of that? - No, I just want to smell it. - Grandma, I promise you, I have the best birthday surprise for you ever if you could just hold out until Sunday. - Are you getting married? - Yes. I am. (gentle music) - Where's the ring at? - Well, he hasn't proposed yet but it's coming. - Carter better treat you like a queen because it's been so long coming dear. - What did you just say? - I said I want some macaroni and cheese. - No, no, no, Grandma, before that. What did you just say? - I said don't cook no chitlens in my house cause I don't want it smelling bad. (Elle Rose laughs) - Wow. Wow (chuckles). I love you. - I love you. (gentle music) - Can I come up for a cup of coffee? - No you didn't just give me that played out can I get some booty line. - No, no, I didn't mean it like that. I would never disrespect you. I just had such an amazing time (R&B music) I was trying to find a way to make the night last a little longer. - Ahh, you're so sweet. - So? - Don, honestly (record scratches) I think we should slow things down a bit. - Where is this coming from? - I don't like mixing business with pleasure. When it comes to you, I think I got ahead of myself. - So you're breaking up with me? - No! No, I am not breaking up with you. I am slowing things down with you. - I feel like there's something you're not telling me. I don't have to be a neurosurgeon to notice there's more between you and your brother-- your friend--than you're telling me. The way he looked at you in that dress today, that's no way a brother would look at his sister. - Don, it's not what you think. - No? I respect the virtue of honesty above everything. That's what attracted me to you when we first met, that brutal honesty. - Okay. You're right. The dynamic between Carter and myself is changing. - It's obvious. - Is it really? - When you figure out what you wanna do, let me know. Until then, I'll be your client. However, I'll have my PA Michelle work with you instead. My feelings for you just complicate things. - Don. - It's okay. I appreciate the honesty. (R&B music) Now you get that feeling, something's changed Now you get that feeling, something's changed Now you get that feeling, something's changed Now you get that feeling, something's changed I can't wait no more, can't wait no more - I can think of a better way to release some aggression. Girl, how long has it been for you? - See, and that's the problem with the world we live in today. - What? - Since when did casual sex become the norm? Why can't people build something together first before jumping in bed together? - Oh okay, like what you and Carter are doing? - Girl, bye! I just lost what could've been my destiny for this crap. And I went to the hospital today and brought the software myself, and Don wouldn't even look at me. - See, I told you from jump this was a very, very bad idea. - This is a gift. - A gift? Since when did deception become a gift? - Both: Fine! - You know what, no it's not fine. Stop with the deception, call him, yes, actually call him and tell him the truth. - Girl, Carter is a whore! It's the simple things in life I have helped him cheat before, okay, numerous times. I know who he is and I know how he is, and I'd have to be insane to want to build anything with him. - Right. I was talking about Don. (upbeat music) Listen, this little date you have tomorrow with Carter, let it be play-play for him, but Elle, for once, let it be real for you. (upbeat music) - Roses, I said wear something you don't mind getting dirty. - I don't mind getting this dirty. And why do you look like you're about to go jogging? I thought we were going on a date. - We're not going jogging but you cannot wear that. You'll get it filthy. - Okay, so what kinda date is this? - You'll see when we get there, but for now, just throw on an old pair of jogging pants and a filthy shirt. - (sighs) What kind of date is this? You should've let me pick the date. - Aye, you've got the next one alright? - Now, I've gotta go change. - Well, let me know if you need some help with that. - And behave yourself. - If you change your mind, I'll be right out here. - Elle Rose: Okay, Carter. - I'm coming back. - Elle Rose: Behave yourself. - That's hard to do. - You throw it on the wheel, hence they call it throwing pottery. To make the process work, the clay has to run true on the wheel. Instructor: If you're going to make a piece of pottery, it has to be centered. Instructor: It has to be running true. If it's not, nothing's going to work later. That's coning up. And then you smush it down. - Okay. So now. Why isn't mine doing what his is doing? - You're not applying pressure equally with both hands. - Oh my God. Are you an expert potter now? - Well, mine looked a lot better than yours does. - Really? Okay, how does this look? (chuckles) - Not too good, but how does this taste? - Carter, you're getting me dirty, I'm already so dirty. - How about a little bit dirtier? - Oh my God, stop! Stop! You make me sick. Stop. (Carter chuckles) - Okay, so, how about if you, you control the speed with your foot, and I'll guide our hands. - Okay. This isn't too bad, what do you think? - Instructor: It's still among us and that's not something many people can do on such an early attempt. - So we are making progress? - Instructor: We're making progress. - We're making progress. - So if you don't go through the test, the firing, then you may not ever have anything of permanence. Instructor: No one really likes testing, but this, you can come back in two weeks, if I keep filling up the pie plate with water, it's not going to change. It's already been transformed. Some of the firing we do here goes to 24 hundred degrees. So it's fire that tries the quality of every man's work. (jazzy music) - No, no, no! Carter, I hadn't even saved that yet. You just made me lose - Chill. everything I've been working on. - Most of it's gonna save on the cloud. Come on. What do you think? - That is good, that is good. - Carter: Yeah, I found it on one of those Facebook recipes. - Oh wow. So is the food done? - Carter: Almost. - You ready to eat? - I'm ready to eat. - You're that hungry, you're just gonna stare me down in the kitchen? - I'm gonna stare you down in the kitchen. - Why don't you go and head to the table. - Can I take this? - Carter: Ahh, no, no. No work at the table, come on. (jazzy music) - Carter, this food is delicious. - Thank you. - And this day has been lovely. I have really enjoyed myself with you today. Like for real, Carter, not pretend. - Well, I've had a lovely time with you too. - This seems so real. - Yeah, I was thinking, I don't think there's anyway anybody can see through this, not even Evan. Maybe tomorrow, maybe we can meet him at a coffee shop. - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Nothing. So, we meet Evan tomorrow at the coffee shop. - I came across this. (gasps) - The other day and I thought to myself, this, (chuckles) this is all Roses. What's wrong? - Why can't this be real? - Come on, Roses. I thought we were on the same page? - When I kiss you, I feel something. And you can't convince me that you don't feel something too. You know what, don't worry about it. Just, just give me a moment okay. Just give me a moment. I can get back into character. I can do this, I just... I need time to process it. - Roses. Hey Roses, look, I'd be lying if I said I don't feel something when we kiss. I'd be lying if I didn't say I wasn't scared to death when I kiss you. - Why? - Because when I kiss you, I feel something that I don't ever feel, not even with Charlene. And that scares me to death. - It scares me too. (saxophone plays) - I know me. I don't wanna hurt you. - Then don't. (saxophone plays) - Mama. Mama. It's time to take your medicine, Mama. Mama, it's time to... (melancholy music) - You think we missed them, thanks to you and your morning routine? - Well, maybe if you weren't so good at what you do, I could control myself. (phone rings) - That's probably him calling now. - Right. - Maybe I should call him. - Yeah. (relaxed music) - Look, that's him texting now. He's pulling up. - Are you nervous? - No. Okay, maybe a little, yeah. - Me too. - I tell you what, when I have to tell Mr. Ellison, that's when it's really gonna hit me. (relaxed music) Oh my God. - Five dollars. (relaxed music) - Elle Rose: Okay, let's freeze this frame. (record scratches) Yes, I'm sitting at the table, and yes I am pissed off. Let me tell you why. I know Carter. I know how he does. The moment he saw Charlene, immediately, I became forgotten, which is how we ended up in this situation because Charlene peeped my ring, heard him call me baby, and she thought everything she'd been believing all along was true. But for me, it only manifested the reason why this accidental falling in love was worse than an accident. It was a train crash. (drink splashes) (relaxed music) Elle Rose: And if a train crash isn't bad enough, my brother just had to come and deliver some news that would knock me to my knees literally. - You guys might wanna have a seat. - I'm not sitting down. - Sit down, girl. Grandma died in her sleep last night. (melancholy music) (Elle Rose sobs) (melancholy music) Evan: Elle. (melancholy music) (woman sobs) Evan: I think you've done enough. Why can't you just leave her alone man? (woman sobs) - Mama! (woman sobs) - Can you please talk to me? - There is nothing to talk about. And here's your ring back. There's no reason to pretend anymore. - Roses. - Can you move? - I really hope Pastor Kivens do not give grace. - Can everyone hold hands please, bow your heads. Dear Heavenly Father, we come to you as humbly as we know how, dear Lord, to thank you for this day. Even in the midst of sad times, we pray that you continue to bless this family with the strength that they will need to make it through these upcoming days. Pastor Kivens: Let them always feel Mama Rose's arms wrapped roundabout them, just hugging them, squeezing and pinching their cheeks and tickling their feet. - What is he even talking about? - Shh! - Shecre: You shh! - And we thank you, heavenly Father, that folks respect you enough not to talk during praying, even if they saved or a sinner. Pastor Kivens: And we thank you that because of your love and kindness, your grace and your mercy, that the sinners don't catch fire right before our very eyes and burn to cinders like wood in a fireplace. In Jesus's most wonderful, marvelous, sanctified and sacrilegious name we pray, let everyone say amen. - All: Amen. - Amen. - Woman: This food is delicious. - You've got this Elle Rose. You're gonna go in there and you're gonna nail this presentation. Because you are a boss, and that's what bosses do. (upbeat music) - Man: We've increased our efficiency... (record scratches) Hey, Elle. You should be careful. I think my raise is down there. It's coming up right? Right? That was my boss. She just tripped coming off the elevator. (upbeat music) - Elle Rose: So, of course, I went in there and I nailed the contract. I mean, we didn't sign right away but when you know you've nailed a contract, oh, you know you've nailed a contract. (upbeat music) Elle Rose: And so Carter did his presentation but I had already won. (upbeat music) And because I knew that he was just dying inside because I had just landed my own $10 million contract, I waited and waited for the phone call to come but the phone call never came. And because of the size of the contract, I just expected him to show up at the door. But he never came. - You should go talk to him. - There's nothing to say. - Y'all are best friends. - Were. We were best friends. - See now you're being stubborn. Don't nobody know you like Carter. Nobody's done life with you like Carter. Don't write him completely out of your life just because of one mishap. - Okay, wait a minute. Aren't you the one who told me that the reason why I was fooled by Joseph is because I saw the signs but I chose to overlook them? Well, sweetheart, I'm taking heed this time, and you should be proud of me, not reprimanding me. - This is different. - It's really not. It's not. - Sorry to interrupt you ladies, but when you finish setting up, do you mind if I take a picture... Don't I know you from somewhere? Enrique: Weren't we onset together at - Rock Hill, South Carolina, Cinema's "Second Time Around." I remember you. - Enrique: You still acting? - Shecre: Of course. Actually, I just got back from Miami filming a feature. - I just finished shooting a feature in Harlem. - Oh, well how was that? - It was great. (clears throat) - You know what? Let me finish helping my boss with this cake and then we'll play catch-up. - Alright. - There, you got it. You should be good, right? - You're fired. - You're funny. I love you, Elle Rose. - I love you too, Shecre. - So how was it? - Enrique: It was great. (distant conversation) - Bartender: Cheers. - I wanna speak to the manager. - Sir, I legally cannot serve you anymore alcohol, you're drunk. - I'm not drunk. Am I drunk? Do I look drunk to you? You know how crappy my life would have to be to be drunk this early in the day? - Man, I'm not a therapist. I'm just a bartender. - Then let me speak to your manager. - Bartender: I can't. He's in the middle of doing interviews. (Carter chuckles) (inspiring music) - (chuckles) Oh, no way. Thank you. Thank you. Hey guy, life sucks sometimes, but it will get better. (laughs) Oh my God, yes! - He didn't touch that? - Yeah, he licked the rim. (inspiring music) - Come on in. - Carter's here. Again. - (sighs) You can send him in. - You want me to send him in? - Yeah, you can send him in. - Alright. - Are you Ms. Elle Rose Hart? - Carter, we need to talk. - Oh, so you are Ms. Elle Rose Hart. That's great. You're just the person I'm looking for. I heard that you are hiring software developers for your new healthcare IT department, and I would love the opportunity to be considered for employment. - Seriously? - Very seriously. So seriously in fact that I thought I'd come here in person just to show you what you'd be bringing onto the team. - So you are leaving Wright Solutions? - I'd like to merge Wright Solutions with your vision. - So if I decide to take you on, why should I hire you? - Well, firstly, I would point to my vast expertise. I have years of specialized experience under my belt. - I think we both can attest to the truth of that statement, can't we? - Also, my company's profit line speaks for itself. Not only do we have record sales, but I also have a broad knowledge base in healthcare software. Furthermore-- - But are you loyal? - I will be. - Are you selfless? - I can be. - Tell me about a time in your life where you put someone else's needs before your own without expecting anything in return. - Okay, well this example may be a bit dated, but it's the first that comes to mind. I once had this female friend, she's very, very beautiful. And this particular friend needed a prom date the day before prom because she was dumped by her boyfriend. He left her for the head of the cheerleading squad. Even though I had not been to my own prom, I decided to go with her just so she wouldn't go alone. And I can recall wearing this light blue silk shirt, and I really liked this shirt. I remember that light blue silk shirt being ruined because this friend snotted and cried all over it when she saw he ex-boyfriend kissing the cheerleader. Does that sound familiar? - I did not snot all over your shirt. - Roses, your snot was all over your upper lip, your face. - Oh my (laughs). - All over me. - It was not that bad. Maybe I did snot a little bit, but - More than a little. - But he broke my heart. - Allow me to spend the rest of my life mending it. Hire me. - I'll think about it. - Okay. I'll give you some time. - And if it's a no? - If it's a no then, as hard as it may be, I'll walk away. You won't ever have to worry about me bothering you again. - For the love of God, Ms. Hart, please say yes. - Carter Wright, I want you to bother me for the rest of my life. Where's my ring? - Marry me. - Do you take Elle Rose to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, to cherish until death do you part? - I do. - I do. (romantic music) - Listen, when you get home, I want you to sprinkle oil everywhere, I'm talking about sprinkle oil everywhere, all on the walls, in the bed, on the bed, in the bathroom, on the remote. Don't forget the remote. Sprinkle some oil on that so when he have it, he'll be like, mami, what's this? You know, you ain't gotta say nothing. And then in the car, the driver side, sprinkle some oil on that. And if he's getting ready to go somewhere and you know it, ease out there real quick, put a little bit on the ceiling so it'll drop down on his head. - Pastor, he's not that bad. he's gonna be okay. - Yeah, as long as you're sprinkling that oil, he's gonna be just fine. So we're gonna touch and agree and pray in Jesus's name. - In Jesus's name. - In Jesus's name. - Pastor, you alright with me. - Amen. (romantic music) - Elle Rose: So that's the story of how I accidentally fell in love with and married my best friend. And I asked Carter, I said, why did Grandma have you take her to the airport, and he said because that was her only regret in life, that fear kept her grounded and she never soared her wings to fly. And you know what, when presented with the opportunity to fly, yes, you have to hit turbulence sometimes, like what my father is experiencing now because grief is more than just an emotion, it's a journey, and some people get lost along the way. And it also made me realize that the landing is just as important as the takeoff, so you have to finish things you started, which is why I went on and finished Don's software. But when presented with the opportunity to stay grounded or spread my wings and fly Reed Robust, E-Struct Tab. - Men: E-Struct Tab? - Can we see your projections? - Of course. Isn't that what we're here for? - Nice doing business with you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Elle Rose: Well, I chose to take a chance on healthcare software, and I chose to take an even bigger chance on love, because you know what, when you trust the Pilot, I mean the true Pilot, then it's okay to fly. Yeah, it's okay to fly. (upbeat music)
