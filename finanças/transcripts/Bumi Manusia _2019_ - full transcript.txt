RumahKarangan IN A MOMENT, "INDONESIA RAYA," THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, WILL BE ECHOED. DEAR AUDIENCES, PLEASE STAND UP. FROM THE MASTERPIECE OF PRAMOEDYA ANANTA TOER The Indies. Dutch East Indies. My motherland is learning a new word. "Modern." The word that catapults my mind to the other side of the world. Europe. Welcome, progress. Please enjoy all these newfound things. Inventions of new technologies that shorten ways and distances. I was lucky to experience that in my youth. Mesmerized by the charms of European science and ideas, I got swept away... forgetting my roots as a native. People beneath the Dutch and the mixed. The people who become guests in their own motherland, molded to look up to the greatness of Europeans. European education. European lifestyle. Minke. Hey! Minke! Hey, Minke! Hey! Open the door, Minke! Hey! Sir. What are you doing here? - Minke! - Are you sure he's inside? Where else can he be? I'm his only friend. Have you checked at Jean Marais'? Minke! You sleepyhead. What is this smell? Ah... Max Havelaar. - You are so miserable! - Suurhof! - A pervert and a dreamer. - Suurhof! All you can do is dream. Come, Minke. Let's go out and feast your eyes. There's a lot of people gathering in the street. So what, Suurhof? What's out there? Minke, you forgot it's her coronation today? Honey, I'm going. It's starting already? Stop. Mama! Raden Mas Mulyo. Ready? One, two, three. This is going to Wonokromo. And that to Tanjung Perak. Please. This ice cream is the greatest invention, Minke! The human brain can not only transform the wooden ship into the steamboat, it can bring cold air to tropical lands. Come on, move it. Hurry! It tastes weird. You and your Javanese palate. Let's go there. KRANGGAN - SURABAYA I want to talk to you about something. Hey! That is a private club for Dutch of pure blood! Relax. I'm here. You're a mixed-blood, not a pure-blood. Let's leave. NO NATIVES OR DOGS ALLOWED Come on. Suurhof... Stop. What are you doing here? - This is a Dutch private club. - We don't intend to enter-- Speak in Malay. Dutch is not for monkeys to speak. - Out. - Let's go somewhere else. - My mood's ruined. - Go on! - Come on, Suurhof! - Here? I said to look for another caf√©. - Not this place. - Just shut up. What is so important that you woke me up this early? Annelies Mellema. Who is that? You local playboy. You're so lame. This one is in Wonokromo. She's of mixed-race. More beautiful than the girl in your treasured photo. And? What does she have to do with me? Ah, the question I have been waiting for. If you are a real man, I happen to know her brother. Robert Mellema. We're fans of the same football team. In a few days, I'll be visiting his place. I will pick you up. No. I'm swamped with work. Go find someone else. Chicken. You haven't even entered the ring. Deal! Deal. See you later, ma'am. See you, Sastro. Minke. You sure you want to hang out with him? Don't you know what people are saying about him? What? His mother tried to give birth on a ship so he'd be considered pure-blooded Dutch? Not only that. If science ever invents a blood-washing machine, he'll be first in line to wash off his native blood. All right. See you. Take care. - What is this? - Hey, Minke. Why rent such a fancy carriage, Suurhof? This is more than fancy. It has special springs. Twice the price of the carriage itself. This golden chariot will carry you to court the girl of your dreams, and me to eat veal. Cool, right? - Veal? - Exactly. That's how wealthy they are. You'll thank me later. After you, my good sir. If this Annelies is as beautiful as you say, why not take her yourself? SURABAYA DAILY NEWS She's mixed-race. Even if she is as beautiful as a rose, she's still not of pure blood. I only go for Dutch of pure blood. One hundred percent European. You are too naive, Minke. The world is a like a garden. Colorful. But the stem of a tulip is still worth more than a bunch of roses. Ow! - My mangoes! - Hey, stop! - You stupid woman! - What's wrong with him? Look what you have done! - Come here! - I'm sorry, master. CONCUBINES AND SLAVERY I need a tulip. Not a rose or even a nyai Nyai! - This is yours. - Thanks, miss. You too, Minke. You'll be a regent someday. The next time we meet, I'll just have one question. "How many do you have in your harem?" You think so little of our race? I am a Javanese who'll never have a harem, Suurhof. I also won't be a regent, ever. Such bullshit. Minke. You see that place? I bet you're going to end up in that opium den... ...owned by Babah Ah Tjong! Ah! We're here, Minke. My name is Robert Suurhof. I'm a guest of your master, Robert Mellema. BUITENZORG ESTATE Mellema. - How are you? - Good. I brought a friend. Is that OK? Minke, Robert. Robert, Minke. Just Minke? No family name? Parjiah! Two ginger drinks, and one plain water. Suurhof, how will our team fare? The next opponent is tough. You're such a pessimist. We just won the last match! Because last week's opponent was weak. Suurhof, this next one is second in the league standings. Miss Annelies, how are you? Good. Thank you. Annelies Mellema. Minke. When are we going hunting? Just Minke? - So shameless. - Pitiful. I'm a native. Sit down. Come, sit. What's wrong with being a native? My mom is a native. Javanese. Why take pride in that, Annelies? I'm just stating the facts. Why? Am I wrong? Your guest is my guest now. Let's go inside, Minke. Come. Phonograph. Edison, from America. The steam locomotive. A modern invention. Suurhof, come. Let's get changed first. Airlangga statue. Kris Nogo Manten, from Madura. Nefertiti. I thought people here were only familiar with the delft blue windmill. History happens to be my favorite subject. - And where's your school? - The same as Suurhof. Suurhof, let's go! Those are Mama's favorites. Sie Jin Kwie, right? Originals? That was a gift from Dr. Martinet, our family doctor, from his vacation to China. What else are you familiar with? Sam Pek Eng Tay? The Legend of Princess Chang'e? Mama, that is Minke. He's my friend. Minke, this is my mama. Locals call me Ontosoroh. They find it difficult to say Buitenzorg. You can call me Nyai. What's the matter? I see. So, your view of a nyai is no different than that of the masses. Don't worry about it. Everyone calls me that. If that bothers you, then... just call me "Mama". Like Annelies. Yes, that sounds better. Excuse me, ma'am. - Is it done? - Here's the tally. - You need to recheck this. - Yes, ma'am. This still does not balance. Certainly, ma'am. Sinyo, are you... a regent's son? No, I am not. - You must be a governor's son then? - I am not. Neither a regent's nor a governor's son... but you study at HBS? Fine, whatever you say then. Ann, take good care of our guest. I still have lots of work to do. Sure, Ma. Surprised to see my mama stand up straight like a European woman? I was surprised way before that. Why? I wasn't expecting to meet a beautiful goddess like you. Are you saying that I'm beautiful? Second to none. Mama! Mama! Mama! - What happened? What is it, dear? - Ma! What happened? Did the two of you fight? He said I'm beautiful, second to none. You are beautiful, Ann. The sinyo is not wrong. I've told you the same, often. Please pardon Annelies. She rarely meets a HBS student, or someone of mixed-race, and she-- I don't want to be mixed. I want to be like Mama. A native. Sure, dear. Come, Suurhof. Might as well give me the money you're betting now. Move! Mind your manners! Come, Suurhof. Our prey awaits. Suurhof! Suurhof. Please excuse my friend, Ma. Parjiah! Parjiah? Yes, ma'am? Prepare the veal for dinner. Certainly, ma'am. Miss Annelies. Where are you going? We're going to the field. Hold on, wait, hold on! Who's that? My maid since I was small. Here, hold on. Please wear this so you won't get sunburnt. Else you won't be as beautiful. You'll lose to me. Thank you. OK, you can go now. Such a lovely girl. Thank you. Miss Annelies, when are we going to study again? Let's do it tomorrow, all right? - Have you had lunch? - We have. Don't run around. Ann, what is this place? The houses, and the children back there belong to the farmers who work here. Mama also arranges this field as if it belongs to them. They're free to choose when to work or to take a break, as long as they meet the production target. - All of these belong to your family? - Yes. All 180 hectares of them, with 500 workers. Mama manages all of them, including the finances and all banking matters. Good afternoon, miss. - Going somewhere? - Just walking around. - Be careful. - Sure. This huge lake and all these horses belong to your family? Yes. Bawuk. - Her name is Bawuk? - Yes. I have a new friend, Bawuk. He's Javanese. But he's using a weird nickname. So, here's the story, 'Wuk. When I was small, my teacher called me that. Open your books. Hey, you. Where is your book? Your book! Monkey... Minke! Then I joined HBS, learned English for six months, and found out what it actually means. Monkey. Monkey. What a terrible teacher. I believe... you will make the name Minke wonderful. - Afternoon, noni. - How are you? Good, noni. To be called noni doesn't suit you, Ann. So, what should I be called? Mbakyu or just Annelies, right? Why am I not suited to be called noni? I feel bad for the Dutch women. They all feel inferior because of your beauty. Are you OK, Ann? Ann. Ann! Ann! Where is Miss Annelies? I don't know. Maybe she's in her room. Thank you. From your intellect, it seems history is not the only thing you're interested in, sinyo. - Ma, earlier I... - What else do you like, nyo? I happen to be interested in company management. But I'm still learning. What line of business, nyo? Furniture. Of the highest class, Ma. You might have often seen them in England, Austria, and France. I have everything from Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, to Victorian. I usually travel on ships to sell them, to my schoolmates' parents. Happy is he who eats from the fruit of his own labor. Thank you, Ma. She dresses up for you, nyo. Go ahead and eat, nyo. Suurhof, let's eat. This is great. This is the special menu. Veal. It's very tender. Mr. Mellema. Who gave you permission to come here, monkey? You think by wearing European clothes, befriending Europeans, and speaking a little Dutch, you can be European? No. You're still a monkey! Shut your mouth! Crazy Europeans are no different than crazy natives. - No! - Go to your room! Or I'll call Darsam! Your drunkenness only brings shame to this family! Come to my room. Calm yourself, Ann. That's just how your papa is. Don't think badly of me, nyo. That's for his own good. Forgive my father, Minke. Parjiah. - Yes, ma'am. - Get Darsam here. Forgive us, nyo. I'll take my leave. Goodbye. Sinyo. Is it true that earlier, you kissed Annelies? Then do it again now, in front of me. Go on. Ann, come. - Mama... - Come on, dear. Come on, nyo. I need to confirm if she's lying or not. Go on. Nyo. I'm glad. That you are the one who kissed her. You can go home now. Exogamy, legal or illegal, and harem practices which gave birth to mixed children like Suurhof, Robert Mellema, and his younger sister, Annelies, isn't new in the Indies. But, Nyai Ontosoroh... she really makes my modern mind stop working. I have to take care of the cheese, bread, the milk like the one in your glass, plus a letter from a nyai to a fresh young man like you. Be careful! Their reputation is not for nothing. They are erotic, yet also mystical! You may be pursuing her daughter. But that lonely widow is pursuing you. Don't be stubborn. Understand? Today, we are going to discuss the next question. What... happened... in 1648? What are you thinking about, nyo? Minke. Minke! Where's your mind at, Minke? In Wonokoromo, nyai. Hey, Minke. You're usually talkative. Why so quiet suddenly? It seems Nyai Ontosoroh put some kind of spell on me. What? I feel that Nyai Ontosoroh put some kind of spell on me. - Come here! Just humor me! - Why? - What is it? - Here. Is there an educated mind... inside your brain? An educated person must act justly, beginning with his thoughts. And especially in his deeds. You have to know that, Minke. She invited me back to Wonokromo. What is that? I have dealt with Annelies' sadness before. But if her sadness is caused by you... I can only hope for your time. When can you come? A very logical letter from Nyai. You should go. Minke, Minke... Where's the beauty in that, Jean? Jean? I fell in love with a prisoner. That was the biggest mistake of my life. Where is she now? Dead. Dead. - Did you...? - No. She died at the end of her own brother's blade. She was labeled a traitor. Still, our baby survives. Baby? May? When did you realize... that May's mother was your one true love? You see, Minke. Love is beautiful. And also the destruction that may follow. So, you must be brave and face the consequences. Papa, let's go for a walk! One, two, three! Where should we go to? Where? Over there? Let's go! Thank you. You're welcome. Come on. Let's go. Open the gate! Parjiah. Bring his luggage. Annelies is in her room. It seems people from your hometown are looking for you, mas This is your desk. This is your cupboard. - Let me, Ann. - Don't. You're our guest, mas. Thank you. Where's Robert? Maybe in his room. Where did your Mama learn all of this? What school did she go to? How can a woman, native, not a royal... go to school, nyo? - Go ahead and try them. - Thank you. So, you learned all this on your own? Why not? Life can provide everything to those who want to understand and are good at accepting. Robert. Robert! Where are you going? Robert! What? So, you have yet to realize... that you can't just laze around in this house? So what? You're not a Dutch of pure blood like your father. You have no special privilege. Robert! Leave! Leave! Leave? I'll leave. Perhaps it's better if I take my leave now, Ma. Please stay, nyo. Be a friend, and also a brother, to Annelies. WHO IS NYAI? How did someone like your Mama meet someone like your Papa, Ann? They were happy once. How did they meet? Don't! Please! Please reconsider, husband! Sanikem is our only daughter! Please don't! - Reconsider, please. - What's there to reconsider? Honey, don't, please, honey... That Javanese man was called Sastrotomo. Mama's father. This is the only way. He did anything for money and status. People said he even went to witch doctors to fulfill his wishes. Your sister is about to be sold off! Do something! Sanikem! Please, stop! Sanikem! Honey! Mama was brought to Papa's house. At that time, he was the head paymaster in a factory. Mama was only 14. So, you wish to be a paymaster assistant? Yes. Good. You'll start as an intern. Twenty-five guilders. An amount Mama would never forget for the rest of her life. That was her price. Don't be afraid. Don't move. You're safe. Milk. Milk. M-I-L-K. Milk. Correct? Good. Remember. Crazy natives are no different than crazy Europeans. Papa was actually a nice person. He taught her a lot of things. He gave her everything. Except for one thing. Marrying her legally. This is our new house. Mama looked very happy for the first time. This is the house where me and my brother were born. We were witness of their happiness. How many kilos is this? You've checked it properly? Until one day... Maurits Mellema. Papa's first son with his first wife in the Netherlands. The one man whom Mama has feared all her life. Engineer Maurits Mellema. I was able to track you from your milk company. Listen, Mr. Mellema. My mother, Mrs. Amelia Mellema-Hammers... After you cowardly left us, she had to bend over backwards to raise me. But you accused my mother of infidelity. I told her she could go to court if she wanted a divorce. Why should she? You're the one accusing her! If I filed for divorce, your mother would lose all of her rights to my milk company there. Herman... The fact is, according to law, you are still married to my mother. But you... you've taken a native woman as your mistress outside of marriage! Those words have no place here. I have no business with you, nyai. From that moment on... there was no happiness in this house anymore. Papa lived in the opium snares of Babah Ah Tjong's brothel, fallen into the arms of prostitutes. Maiko! That's why he's here. Dr. Martinet. Your family doctor, right? That was five years ago. Do you know why Mama told me all that, mas? So that I'll marry of my own choice. So there'll be no more tears of suffering. A civilized person... isn't always born from the womb of another. At least, that's what my mother always told me. And Sanikem is proof of that. The question is, does the world really need to know she exists? AN AMAZING NYAI THAT I KNEW BY MAX TOLLENAAR This room now smells of animal. You like my sister? The natives' mentality. Natives like you are always trying to get European girls to raise your status. Monkey! Robert! What are you doing here? I just want to have some rest. To relax a bit. Get out! Or I'll call Darsam. - Darsam! - Wait, wait, wait... Fine, I'll leave. But remember... I'm the eldest sibling in this house. Sinyo! Sinyo? Nyo! - Yes, Ma? - Someone's looking for you. - Who? - Quick. ARREST WARRANT - What do the police want? - Come, follow me. You can't do this. I'm a Raden Mas. I have Forum Privilegiatum. Understand? Right now. Parjiah! Hurry, help the sinyo with his luggage. Ma. What did he do? All we can do is pray for him, Ann. Let's go! Robert. Robert! Robert. Go to Surabaya now. Ask about Minke. No. You go to Surabaya, now! No. You're the one who reported him, right? I'd never bother myself with a native. You little... You're half native! You have no right to insult natives! Then what's the purpose of this European blood in me? You listen to me. I am your mama. A native! I am asking your native blood, not your European blood. Now go to the police station. Quick! You insolent child! My duty is done. - Please come in. The regent is waiting. - What does he want with me? Come in. - Young Master... - What now? - What? - Please crouch in respect. You can stop there, Young Master. You. What took you so long to visit? Bastard! I have to summon you like this first before you'll come? You nearly flunked ELS because of your womanizing. And you're doing it again at HBS? You're out of your mind! Do you forget everything when you're with your nyais? Your father is now regent and has moved here, and you didn't even know that? Foolish child! Doesn't your nyai read the paper? My deepest apologies, Father. I... What? Why didn't you ever reply to our letters? I should really whip you thoroughly! Fool! Tirto. Listen to me. Tomorrow is my coronation as regent. You will be my translator. Understand? Yes. You can go. Min! Your room is over there, Young Master. - Make yourself at home. - Thank you. Brother! - What do you want? Get off! - Brother! I will tell Father! What's with you? - Who gave you permission to read my diary? - So what? You washed-up Javanese! What's the use of being Javanese if my rights are trampled! Is this how a future regent behaves? - Damn you! - So, is this what you call modern? Insulting, no respect for your older brother? Remember, someday you, too, are going to be a regent! - Understand? - I will never be one! Watch your mouth! Try saying that in front of Father. - Say it yourself. Come on! - Enough! What's all this? Mother, all of Tirto's dirty secrets are written in this book. I'm going to tell Father. You're not a regent, but already you want to sell your brother for your own gain? - Give me the book. - I'm not like that. He-- Bring it here now! The book! - Go to your room. - But, Mother... Your room! Go! You're dead! It seems you're no longer Javanese. More like a brown Dutch. Is this how an educated Priyayi is? Perhaps you'll soon forget about your own mother. My deepest apologies. I beg your forgiveness, Mother. Please forgive me. Your mustache has grown thick. No wonder the nyais like you. I beg your forgiveness, Mother. You sent me to a Dutch school so that I can learn what a Javanese doesn't know. You are smart... but don't humiliate people that you think don't understand the things that you understand. Know when to give way. There's great value in that. I'm sorry, Mother. I just want to be a free man, Mother. A free man. Not governed, nor governing others, Mother. And my world is not that of reward, office, status or deceit. My world is this Earth of Mankind with all its problems. Forgive me, Mother. If there's such an era, I'll be happy for you. My one piece of advice is... be responsible. Never be a coward. Yes, Mother. Don't laze around. What's wrong, Ann? Minke? You worry about him that much? Do you love him? Minke doesn't love me, does he, Ma? Don't think too much about it, Ann. Ann? Miriam, look. It's Minke. He thinks he's above them because he goes to HBS. - Girls, be quiet! - Dad, look! Honored guests. We'd like to offer our utmost respects to Mr. Resident Assistant and his daughters. The civilization and manners of the natives have been elevated by the arrival of foreign nations. Therefore, I feel very proud... that the dignity of everyone here... is now also raised because of that. Thank you very much. I will ask my son to translate. Tirto, please translate. Ever since Majapahit was established... this nation has been united under an ambitious oath. Even though it eventually crumbled. But the spirit of Majapahit became the fire... that has burned in the people of the Indies until today. Our civilization has its own policy, transcending the natural resources that seduce other nations. In its essence, our pride and dignity have always been high. A wonderful speech from the Regent and his son. Let's drink to that! You taught your son very well. I'll invite him to my estate tomorrow. I will send a carriage to pick him up. Yes, of course. Listen to me. No more nyais. Give me your word. - Yes, Father. - Yes what? No more nyais. The Raden Mas' luggage, please. Foolish. I will take my leave. Take care. Can you move? I think of you every single day, mas. Mama asked Robert to find out what happened to you in Surabaya. It's been a week, and he still hasn't returned home. Stop. What's the matter? Sorry, miss. I need to make a stop. I have some errands to do. I'm thirsty. Want something to drink? Wait here. Nyo... I think you'd better go back to Kranggan first. That fatso has been following us from the station. How did you know, Darsam? Master Robert asked me to take your life. Relax. Calm down. Trust me. I only follow Nyai's orders. I have to go back to Kranggan. Why so sudden? I left my school assignment. - I need Jean Marais' help to finish it. - I'm coming with you. - No, you can't. - Why not? Why, mas? - Have I been a bother to you? - Not at all. - Then let me go with you. - No. A week. Just for a week. I promise. - Right, Darsam? - Noni, just follow me. I promise. Carriage, please! LIFE IN THE INDIES BY MAX TOLLENAAR Calm down! Miss Peters, Tollenaar is not fit for this discussion. - It's just a pen name. - No. I found an article about life in the Indies. That is rare. You know what's his real name is? No. But I recognize the diction style. Just out with it, you native! So, Max Tollenaar is a student in this class? That's great! Native or not, that doesn't matter. Good writing and ideas are good writing and ideas. In fact, we can learn from it. Miss. Without the Europeans, native civilization would still be left behind. Europeans don't have the traditions of the natives. Natives are nothing but worms. Don't exaggerate, Suurhof. Stop looking down on other nations. See! A mixed-race who defends a native is just as low as a native. I am only a foster child of Pastor Dapperste. I am of native blood! - Just like Minke is. - That's why you're filthy. Animal! Stop! Enough! Stop! Enough! Today's discussion is about literature. That is enough for today. Without any love of literature, your discussions are nothing but the buzzing of bees. Suurhof, Jan, and you, to my office, now. Have you selected the chilis? I have, miss. Oh my God! Miss! Help! Ann? Annelies. It's me, Dr. Martinet. Sinyo, can you please sit beside her? Hold her hand. - What? - Hold her hand. My patient is not only hurting physically. Annelies needs you. More than she needs her mother. I don't think so, Doctor. You know how much Annelies admires her mother. But there are no guarantees that her mother will be there forever. Especially, knowing that, Annelies really wants to be a native. What makes you so sure? You see how she refused my hand? She refused this European hand, even though this is the hand that had previously saved her family. But she held your hand very tight. Do you understand what that means? Annelies needs your commitment up to the point where you'll propose to her. I haven't thought about it that far. Minke, if need be, I'll propose on your behalf. But you can only have one wife. Can you promise that? Starting today, Annelies is not my patient anymore. She's your patient now. Are you ready? You will be her doctor. May I come in? Are you feeling better now? Mas. Tell me a story. What story? Mama has more stories than I do. But yours are better, mas. All right. - Javanese or Dutch? - Mas. - Human or animal? - Mas. - Or maybe ghosts? - Mas! Be patient, I'm trying to think of a good story for you. Uh... Oh! Once upon a time... there was a girl, as beautiful as a goddess. - And her name is? - We don't know yet. I haven't even told you where she lives. She might be in Europe, India, or China. Annelies. Annelies. Mellema? Um... Annelies was born among relentless pressure and stress. But they only fueled her strength and charm. One day, a man came to her house... and fell in love with her. And then he kissed her. And she became furious. The man became really anxious. But luckily, her mother didn't mind at all. That's not right. Her mother was angry. Really? She was angry? This is just a story, mas! And her mother said... "Why are you telling me this? Weren't you waiting for the kiss?" Correct. The girl was waiting for that kiss. That's a lie. That man kissed her out of nowhere. And that princess didn't mind. A lie. Why do you keep lying to me, mas? I think the girl likes made up stories. You two are just like a crab. - Iyem? - Yes? Please bring my bags downstairs. - Yes. - Hurry. Her blood pressure is good. Parjiah! She doesn't need a doctor anymore. I will be leaving for school. I will also take my leave. Ann? Sinyo. Sinyo! We need to talk. I am late, Doctor. This is important. - Have you slept with Annelies? - Doctor! Just answer me, Minke. We don't need to continue this conversation. Then you're only taking advantage of Annelies' fragility. - Why should I answer? - Her fate depends on it. But it has nothing to do with your initial question, Doctor. Let's talk somewhere else. Ann? What's wrong, Ann? You have to know, Minke. She needs to get over her trauma. Are you sure you are not her first? I don't want to answer, Doctor. No. - Answer. - Stop it. - Answer. - Stop it, Doctor. Are you sure you are not the first man? Ann? Ann? It's no use, mas. It's no use. I'll bear this suffering alone. Is it true you are not the first man to sleep with her? Was it they, or him? Him. A good man or a bad man? I can't judge, Doctor. Fine. Then who? Who was he? No. - Who was he? - No. - Who was he, Minke? - No. Stop. - Just tell me. - Stop, Doctor. - Just tell me! - No. I won't. Who was it? I don't want to, Doctor! Who was it, Minke? Just tell me! Robert. Robert! No! Robert! Robert! No! Robert! Robert Mellema. Such calamity has befallen this family. Such calamity... Stop the carriage! Darsam! For the umpteenth time, my friend, Jean was right. Love and tragedy can't be separated. Even if in the future... I have to face my own father's wall. Where have you been? Minke can ride a horse now. I've taught him how. Hey! Who are you? Darsam! That man! Fatso! What's the matter, Sam? Nothing, Nyai. Relax. A suspicious Fatso is here! Mas! Mas! Hey! Mas! - Guard the gate! - That way! Mas! Ann, what is it? - I will look inside. - Sam! Mas, please stay out. - Do not go in there, Ann! - Mas! Darsam! You don't need to chase him. Back away, sinyo. Go home. Darsam! What is it, Ann? Darsam. Mr. Mellema? Ma. Ann. Mr. Mellema, Nyai. He's dead. Ma... Papa! - Ah Tjong! - Papa... Ah Tjong! Where are you? What's all this noise? - Robert! - Chase him down, Darsam! Like father like son! What for? He's going to die either way. The syphilis from me is now in his body. Shut up, you wench! Let's go back home. Mr. Robert! Let's go back home! Bastard! Don't you dare, sir! Damn you! - Come on. - It's OK. Hold it. I chased down Robert, and he shot me. That Robert. The wound is swollen. How come the whole family is inside this notorious whorehouse? All of you, come with me. You. Escort them. Yes, sir. Move! Go cross-examine all the witnesses. SURABAYA POLICE STATION Raden Mas! Raden Mas, a question, please? - Your name is Darsam? - Yes. What is your relationship with Nyai and with Herman? I am Nyai's coachman. His temporary post-mortem said Herman died of poisoning. Now the whole Surabaya will know about this, Ma. BUITENZORG OWNER DEAD IN FRONT OF DAUGHTER IN A BROTHEL THE MURDER OF MELLEMA FOUND DEAD DURING STAY IN BROTHEL REGENT'S SON INVOLVED IN HERMAN MELLEMA'S MURDER CASE Disgraceful! My son has chosen his own path! Send my letter to the Principal of HBS. Yes, Kanjeng. HBS CONNECTED TO MELLEMA MURDER SCANDAL This one! Let's go! Steve, come on, let's go! "The Murder of Mellema." That's your native buddy there. The media is now attacking Nyai. Your speech at the funeral today... is considered as defending her. They can use that as a weapon. WAS NYAI ONTOSOROH INVOLVED? We will be facing an even tougher situation, my child. Parjiah? Mas. Will you run away from us? As long as the sun still rises... I will be here, Ann. I will take a leave of absence from school to defend you and Mama. NATIVE'S COURT Remove your slippers. Wear your shoes! If my mother had to remove her shoes... I will do so. If you can prove in court that she is your real mother, then you can remove your shoes. Crouch walk. Your sickle. You. Sit over there. Come here, miss. Nyai. Ah Tjong, you are the defendant in the case of the murder of Herman Mellema. This poison belongs to you? Judge... Herman Mellema spent more time in my brothel even than me. Why would I murder my best customer? Right? This court will find out who else was involved with you. Sir. Honestly, your case is very complicated. But it is essential it be told to the people. My newspaper, Surabaya Daily News, will help you publish your writings. A NYAI IS ALSO A HUMAN BEING AND MUST BE PROTECTED BY THE LAW The guy who died owns the big Buitenzorg, right? - So lucky to receive all that inheritance. - Not quite. Nyai. People can't stop talking about it. So exciting! Look. Has Nyai ever been in direct contact with Ah Tjong? - I've only met... - Use your own language. I only got the bills from him every month. In the name of Herman and Robert Mellema. I have the evidence. This is the supporting evidence. Thank you. WHO IS THE REAL KILLER OF HERMAN MELLEMA? Raden Mas. What is your connection to this family? I am their guest. A guest? In which room did you sleep? Who is sleeping with Miss Annelies Mellema? I refuse to answer these malicious questions! How could Nyai let such inappropriate behavior happen between her daughter and her guest? Honorable Judge. Since the secret of my family has been exposed, I feel the need to speak up. Herman Mellema, the pure-blooded European, asked me to be his mistress. And none of you objected to that. - Ma, enough. - Sit down, nyo. Between me and Herman Mellema, there's a bond of slavery that the law never bothered with. Between my daughter and Minke... there's an honest bond of love. Is the bond of European slavery more righteous than honest love? Annelies Mellema is mixed-race! She's of a higher status than a nyai. I am her mother. I raised her without even a cent of help from any of you. Did you manage all the finances? Yes, Your Honor. So, without a legal marriage binding, you stand to benefit the most from Herman Mellema's death. Isn't that right? That's it! Unacceptable! Down with mistresses! Down with mistresses! Order! Who made me into a mistress? Who? - Who made me into a nyai? - Order! Why did you make us a laughingstock in this formal forum? Do you all want my daughter to become a mistress like me? You're all depraved! Your Honor! You have to immediately stop this outrageous display! THE CASE IS STILL UNSOLVED TODAY What's with this? The court didn't even look for evidence of who murdered Herman Mellema. It just went around in circles on the personal issues of Nyai and the regent's son. Enough. This is a farce. I know of Robert Suurhof. I think he has a grudge against the regent's son. FROM MARTIN NIJMAN SURABAYA DAILY NEWS No one can escape from their problems, my son. The quality of a person, good or bad, depends on how they solve their problems. NATIVES INDEBTED TO EUROPE BY ROBERT SUURHOF Suurhof is trying to deflect attention from his attacks on me to the issue of Europe versus natives. They keep blindsiding us. My saliva hasn't even dried from yesterday's court. There he is. He's my freelance writer. His name is Kommers. He is very talented. He sympathizes with you guys. The good news is, he's good at writing and speaking Malay. Your court leans very heavily in favor of Europe. And that is a pity. Europe creates the law. And Europe plays with them. The natives are just the audience. The cheering squad. And the accused in the show. However, they will not take their own law lightly. I need to present a key witness. THE COURT MUST PRESENT MAIKO AS A WITNESS Robert paid more than Herman. And he only slept with you? Answer me! A geisha only served the guest who paid well for her service. I served a lot of guys. Is it true that you transmitted syphilis to Robert Mellema? Answer the question! Not only did I give syphilis to the son, I also gave poison to the father. Order! Who gave you the poison? Who else? Order! Order! Order! Order! With this, I declare... that Sanikem, also known as Nyai Ontosoroh, and the others are cleared of all charges. It's over. It's finally over, Ma. This is just the beginning, nyo. Time for you to go back to school, mas. With the likes of them, Ann? No. That's precisely why. We can't just sit around and do nothing. Papa's death has opened my eyes. We can overcome all of this. And becoming a HBS graduate... is one of the ways to do it. Look! That's her. Don't they have any shame? Going home together like that. Damn mistress! She has no shame. She has shame, but her skin is too thick! That's right. European. Natives. Mixed or indigenous. It's not a guarantee to be just... either in thought or deed. Hey, nyai's boyfriend. It's the same with them, who claim to be learned and well-educated, with their European style and language. Congratulations. Your big problem is resolved. I respect your persistence... in being able to argue your case in court. However... as the school principal, I still have to expel you. Your relationship with Annelies sets a bad example for other students. Your father even asked me to expel you from school. Sorry, Minke. Minke. HBS is too small for you. It's time for you to show the world... that you're not a coward. Marry Annelies. You look dashing, Minke! This is what a real man looks like. But remember, keep your heart and always be careful, OK? - Congratulations, Minke. - Thank you. - You are very brave. - Thank you. Hey, Minke! Come down! Quick! Thank you. - Minke! - Yes? - You forgot your hat. - Thanks, ma'am. Goodbye! Bye! Mama... in front of my best friend as a witness, I promise I will marry Annelies. Minke. Who is she, mas? My teacher. Miss Peters. Excuse me if I'm bothering you. The principal wants to see you. IN WHOSE HANDS LIES THE DUTCH INDIES' FUTURE? I don't want anything to do with the school. The Alumni Board wrote a letter to the Principal. They protested the school's decision to let go of a brilliant student like you. You have won, mas. Annelies is right, nyo. It is time for you to celebrate your victory. TO RM TIRTO ADHIE AT BUITENZORG They are the ones who beat the gamelan. But the gong is in your hand. Minke. Ever since our encounter at my home, Dad has stated his admiration for your intelligence. As have I and Sarah. You are the answer to my father's restlessness over the natives' conditions. This year, we learned a new word. Modern. What does "modern" mean, according to your smart teacher? An enthusiasm. - Enthusiasm? - Yes. A view that prioritizes knowledge aesthetics, and efficiency of time. Do you know who Dr. Snouck Hurgronje is? He's a man similar to you. A Javanese man with a modern way of thinking will be a way out for your nation. Just like a gong among the gamelan. All the rhythm stops when you hit it. Dr. Snouck proposed the concept of Association. Modern natives... Must be able to stand on equal ground with Europeans. Solving issues together within one organization. Is that it? You will be that gong, Minke. That kid is brilliant. Welcome back! The final exam is coming up. Will you be able to catch up on your studies, Minke? Yes. Of all the humans on my ancestors' earth, besides Mother and Mama, the Resident Assistant de la Croix and his daughters have proven that there are still civilized people, regardless of where they come from, what skin color they have, or what language they speak. It's time for the world to see my goddess. - Minke! - Jan! - Follow me, I have good news. - What? - Come. This way. Come. - Why? Minke. It is so glad to see you. Come here. Look at your grades. Excuse me. First place. I ranked first, Ann. You're awesome, Minke. Thank you, Jan. Congratulations, Minke. Minke. You are the top graduate in Surabaya. And number two in Dutch Indies! That's fantastic! Thank you. I don't see Suurhof anywhere. He usually shows up wherever there is food and parties. Being number five is perhaps a bit shameful for his ambition. I have an announcement! Come. On this happy day, I will extend an invitation. Annelies and I are inviting all the HBS family to attend our wedding next month. Your mother is here. Mother. Welcome, ma'am. Please. Minke. Jan? What happened to you? Sorry... that I came in this horrible condition. I jumped off my ship. Where were you going? My parents were taking me to Europe. But that's never going to happen, Minke. My blood is here. Jan Dapperste... must become Panji Darman. I will even die to achieve that. Unfortunately, I can't sell my life at civil registration office. Nyai... Mama is considering the spices business. I'm sure she will need employees. So, you can still use the name Panji Darman. Thank you. All right. Come in. Let Parjiah or Pono take care of you. You really smell. - Slow down. I've walked a lot already. - Sorry. I can only bring you this for a matching outfit. Thank you, ma'am. Just call me mbakyu. Here, try this. Mother. Please forgive me for all my mistakes. I ask for your blessings. You have my blessing, my good son. Please bless this child, your flesh and bone, your precious son. Protect him from any misfortune, wrongdoing, hate and defamation. He is the son who I have loved most. I brought him into this world with my life at stake. Even though you have a modern mind, stay an eloquent Javanese. Surrender your body and soul to God Almighty. I accept the marriage and wedding of Annelies Mellema, daughter of the late Herman Mellema, with the dowry of a golden ring and a set of prayer equipment in full. Valid. Valid. Praise be to Allah. You two are happy now. Don't let trivial things like grudges get in your way. I've always respected you, Minke. Especially today. Wish me a safe journey to Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like your attention, please. For Annelies, and Dr. Minke. I have been lucky to be a witness of a very beautiful love... that grew after a huge storm. I want all of you here this afternoon to be witnesses of a love that grows from such a noble heart. To Minke and Annelies. Cheers. Mas! Be careful. The typewriter goes in the center. The books will go here. That long just to move books? What's wrong, mas? It turns out that he liked you all this time, Ann. "Tulip, Minke." Suurhof. He's jealous that I am close to you. That's why he never plays fair against me. Right? I never replied to his letters. Seriously? And finally, he came with you. I knew that he wanted to boast by insulting you in front of me. But what he didn't know, mas, is that I'm not like other mixed girls. - Really? - Of course! Really? Mas! - Mas! - Really? It's still bright outside, for goodness sake. I'm jealous. I miss you, mas Pono... Sir. Here. Put those here. Panji. What time is it? Are Mama and Annelies home yet? I'm not sure. I was here the whole time. It's been three hours. Relax. Probably that summons from the European Court is just some administrative stuff. - Nyo! - There's Darsam. - Where are the others? - Come with me, to the court. What is it? Who's dead this time? Robert? Just come! Let's go! Maurits wants to seize everything? That's the court order, Nyai. He can do that even without presenting himself in here? Stop. EUROPEAN COURT SURABAYA Why are you so quiet, sir? Can I have a minute to talk? That won't be necessary. I will take care of this. Ma? Ann? Ma? What's wrong? It's all gone. All gone, nyo. What's gone, Ma? Ma? Since Robert is missing and Annelies is considered underage, all our properties will be taken away by that damn Maurits. Maurits. No. This cannot be. But Annelies is my wife. Your marriage is considered invalid. And I am accused of conspiring to rape by those savages. And you didn't fight back? What do you think I've been doing all the time inside that room? So, just with these papers, he can destroy our life? Let's go, Ann. Ann? - Ann! - Ann! Darsam! POST OFFICE For Mr. Resident Assistant de la Croix. And end this to Martin Nijman, editor of Surabaya Daily News. Thank you. Sedatives again, doctor? This situation elevated her blood pressure. At least this will calm her down. Ma... Mr. Resident Assistant will send a good lawyer from Semarang. Miriam is taking him here now and I'll pick them up at the station. - Excuse me. - Thank you. In Amsterdam's court record, it is stated that Nyai never legally married Herman. And Herman never divorced his first wife. What does that mean? That means, according to the law Herman couldn't lawfully acknowledge Annelies and Robert as his children. That means... Maurits doesn't have any rights over Annelies. - Correct? - That is correct. However, I just received news from Amsterdam. Herman's first wife filed for divorce. And Herman granted her request. So, when Maurits came to sue my husband five years ago, it was all a lie? He said his mother never filed for divorce while actually it was already official! Those damn Dutch! Ann! Now the pen is all we have left. And I will fill it with blood! "THIS EARTH OF MANKIND WITH ALL ITS PROBLEMS" BY RM TIRTO ADHIE To respect and honor other members of Mankind. To not scorn others of Mankind. They are opposing the Dutch. They won't win. The important thing is, they are brave enough to do it. That is Nyai's daughter, isn't it? - The one with the wedding. - That's her. Her mother is a mistress. They were never legally married. I want all my articles to be published in Malay. - Definitely! - Thank you. The European Law in view of the Native Law. This is quite controversial, Minke. This will be debated in public. You're pitting European law against Islamic law. That is a gutsy move. One, two, three! This world is in chaos. Law is becoming even more arbitrary. The law shows who is strong and who is weak. Who's getting eaten, and who gets to eat. This must be told. What is this? This is an insult to Islamic law! We have to fight this! That is European law. That is how they are. Now compare that to Islamic Law. See the balance of this law. All human beings are born equal. EUROPEAN COURT SURABAYA Be just! Because being just will bring you closer to piety. God is the Greatest! Get out of here, all of you! Mama! Is Ann awake yet? - She's still not well. What is it? - She needs to see this! - What's that? - A letter from the Religious Law Office. This is the cure, Ma. Ann will be cured with this. Ann. Our marriage is valid. You don't have to worry anymore. This is our proof. This document. Ann. Our marriage is valid. Ann. Ann. Our marriage is valid. This is the document. Ann? Please get well soon, Ann. Europe. Glorified as the center of science and civilization, and yet they can so easily seize our rights. Shame is not a part of their civilization. All they care about is getting what they want. I never went to school, nyo. I was never taught to respect... or even admire the Europeans. We will be the first natives to fight the European Court without any lawyer. By fighting back, we'll never truly lose. Are you prepared for this? They even oppress the children of mixed blood. Our children will be treated worse. If we just let it be, they will oppress us further. I would rather die fighting than die suffering! Fight back! Fight back! EUROPEAN COURT SURABAYA Forward! Have no fear! Let's go. Hold on a second! Listen to me first! Those people inside, Nyai and everyone, are good people. I am their witness! This is not about Nyai! This is not about Islam or Kafir! This is oppression. This is injustice! According to the evidence gathered, the marriage between Sanikem and Herman Mellema is not legally valid. Therefore, Sanikem doesn't have any rights to Herman Mellema's estate. Including the custody of Annelies Mellema and Robert Mellema. I object, Your Honor. Use your own language! I object. I am Sanikem. I gave birth to them. I object! Annelies Mellema will be taken by ship from Surabaya to Amsterdam in five days from now. No! I will never agree to this ruling! I am Annelies' husband according to the Religious Court. - That is valid! - That is valid! Look at this! Look at this! Then go talk in that court, not here. In this court, Annelies is a maiden with no husband. - Listen to me. - Annelies' guardian is in Amsterdam. This court ruling is final. Look! Legally speaking, the two of you no longer have any relation to Annelies. - Ma! - Everyone, stand up. Damn you! You're all monkeys! EUROPEAN COURT SURABAYA Move it! Give way! RELIGIOUS LAW DOESN'T APPLY IN COLONIAL NATION Give way! A NYAI WILL STILL BE A NYAI NO LAW WILL PROTECT HER The colonel is here. Open the gate! Make way! Pack your things, nyo. We'll be escorting Annelies to the Netherlands. Stand back! What do you want? - Open the gate! - You want to die? What kind of law separates a mother from her child? The Devil's law! Open the gate! Move! - What is going on? Stop where you are. - I have to go inside. I have to go inside. Stop. What are you doing here? I'm Mellema's family doctor. We don't have any business with you, Doctor. I have to go inside. We don't have any business with you, Doctor. You, and you, escort this man out of here. Move it! Turn back! Turn around! Go back! Mama promises, Ann. Mama will be with you wherever you go. Break the gate! Get them all! Don't let anyone go! Get them! Don't let them escape! Forward! Forward! Forward! Forward! Forward! Forward! What's going on out there? Oh my God! Ma'am! Help! Help! Nyo! Oh my God! Parjiah! Iyem! Iyem! Pono! Pono! What's going on? Where's Darsam? Lock the doors! Ma! They're inside. Watch Annelies. I'll handle them, Ma. - Ma... - This is my house. Make sure your wife is safe. I will teach a lesson to those animals! Open the door! - What do you want? - Let me in! Let me in right now! Get out of my house! - Let me in! - You savage! Stop it! As long as I still lubricate the joints in this house, your law is no use in here. Whatever. We can camp here for as long as we want. I will not let that happen. You can live here as long as I'm allowed to escort my daughter. No way. I am her mother! You people are really animals. You have taken away my custodial rights, and now my rights to escort her, too? Go talk to the court. I'm just here to send an official doctor from European Court for your daughter. - Send a doctor? By killing people? - Shush, enough. Go inside. Damn you. Stop. Let her pass. Nyo. Ma? Who was that? - We don't have much time. - Who was that? We can't escort Annelies. Be strong, my child. - Move it! - Move it! - Miss Mellema is upstairs. - Thank you. - Ma? - Get in, nyo! Who are you? The official doctor sent by the court. I was appointed by the court to check on Miss Annelies. - Mrs. - Miss. Annelies is still a maiden. - Who might you be? - I am her husband. Leave! I need to check her condition. Move aside. What is this? How could you give her such a high dose of sedative? All of you will get sued. Sue in your own house! Not in my house! What you did is a crime! You all will be jailed for this! Out! - I have warned you... - Out! Whatever happens, nyo... someone has to escort Annelies. Why me? Because we need your help. As Jan Dapperste, not Panji Darman. With that name, you can be in one chamber with Annelies. But I'm not worthy of this, Minke. Please... just a small favor for a man who has been helping you all this time. Ann? Ann! Where have you been? Your fever is gone. You're OK? Mama! Ann has recovered! - Mas... - You've recovered. Your breakfast is ready. Ann... - I can do it on my own. - Mas. I can do it myself. I'm the one who should be feeding you. - Please, mas. - Ann, I can do it myself. Let me feed my husband. For the last time. Tell me a story, mas. Ann... What story do you want to hear? A story about Netherlands. But let me feed you this time. What? How can I tell you a story if my mouth is full? Right? The Netherlands. A land of fairy tale below the sea level. With rivers across the land... and small boats surrounding them. It's so beautiful. There are windmills, dams... nice houses, and a beautiful queen. But still not as pretty as you are, Ann. Everything ready? What are you doing here? Where is Miss Mellema? Get out! Please, don't make this hard for me. Where is Miss Mellema? Mrs. Mellema. Not Miss Mellema. Mama. Can I have your brown suitcase from when you left your house? Why do you need it? I want to see it. From today on, Miss Mellema will be under my care. No. Please, come in. Help me pack my things. I will leave with this. Is that OK? We need to take this as far as possible... so it won't burden you anymore. Just like you, Mama... I will never return to this house. I will never stop fighting for you. It's all right, Mama. You don't have to cry. Ma... Ma. I have one request. Please remarry. Give me a cute little sister. She will be so cute... that she won't be trouble for you like your mixed daughter. Please stop crying. We don't have much time. Mas. We were happy once. Just remember that. And nothing else. Shall we, my dear? Miss. Both of you, stay there! You two, don't let them pass. Yes, sir! Ann! Ann! Let's go! We're leaving! Ann! Go back inside. Go inside. Ann... Ann! Ann! We lost. We lost, Ma! We have fought... the best way we can... in the most honorable way. Europe may divide us, Ann. But I won't let it wrench our souls. My love for you will ignite my ambition. You are the reason for me to put an end to my nation's fate... as slaves in our own land. Independence is a right of all nations, but alien occupation should be erased from Earth as it is against humanity and justice.
