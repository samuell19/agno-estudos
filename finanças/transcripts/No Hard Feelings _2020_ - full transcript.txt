Parvis-Joon, happy birthday! We wish you all the best for your next year. I'm sure you'll find your way. Don't party too hard. We love you. Should I turn it off? So where are you from? Parvis-Joon, where did you get your hair done? Fini did it. It looks good. She's really popular. I heard you have to wait six months for an appointment. - Are these herbs from Iran? - Shirin, could you... - Mum! - Shirin? Could you pass the radishes? Thank you. - It's really good. - Thank you. - Parvis? - Not now, Mum. - Parvis? - No! There's someone on the phone for you. Don't let them talk you into anything again. Just hang up. She says she's from the Red Cross, she wants to talk to you. Fuck. P, A, R, V, - I, S, Z... - Wait, can you start again? P... A, R, V, I, S, Z, A, D, E, H. Here it is. 120 hours community service, right? The main kitchen's down there. Showers are upstairs and downstairs. Communal cooking on Tuesdays, women's group on Thursdays. We just provide the basics, and we offer counseling. It used to be a school. The district gave it to us for the housing project. Have a look around yourselves. I think he's new. What's wrong with him? Is he stupid? Look at his hair. What's he trying to do there? Mum, I lost my key. Are you home already? Can't you come any earlier? Don't touch that. You want me to give you 50 cents for it or what? Firstly, it doesn't cost 50 cents, but 75. And secondly, I don't want you stealing in my store. Let's go. - Hi. - Hi. Could you please ask her to describe her symptoms? I can barely understand her dialect. That's how I feel with my colleagues from Saxony. Could you tell me about your problem? What is she saying? What is she saying? She has problems sleeping. I think she is traumatized. You think? Great. Can't you see she's not well? You can't put her on a plane. Lots of people are traumatized, but that's not enough to stop deportation. I'm really sorry, but I just don't understand. Could you please translate? She says she's pregnant. The first days are the worst. Arab? No, Iranian. There are many of us here. When you cry, your body loses a lot of salt. Thanks. Did you come to Germany by yourself? Yes. Don't worry. You never really feel alone here. Amon! Come play with us. I'll come later. I'm just picking up Bana. Why did you talk to him? - Who? - The new translator. I dunno, he just asked something. Don't talk to him again. That shit's contagious. The new guy's German, right? Think so. I saw somewhere the other day. Where? In your political group? No, I can't remember. Are you into him? Nope. Are you? Nope. You? - Are you? - Stop it! - Are you? - Stop it! I've brought some clothes. For you, Amon. Nice plants. They're my brother's. Since when do we get clothes delivered to our room? It's a new thing. So I can tell you right away if they look shit. I'm going to take a shower. Are you coming to the summer party tomorrow? Yes. - Where are you from? - Isfahan. But I was born here. I can tell. I studied music in Tehran. Really? To become a singer? Let's hear your voice then. Some women are allowed to be singers in Iran now? Of course, don't you know Googoosh? What's that one song? I can't remember... Wait a second, let me think. There's this one song I'm sure you know. You know it! Hi. Hi. - Parvel, right? - Almost. Parvis. Nice flat. How long have you been living here? A good few years. You got here OK? What kind of music is this? House. Oh right. I think that was my first time with someone like you. What? Yeah, I'm not into ethnic guys. Ethnic guys? I mean... hairy, darker-skinned guys. Turks, Greeks, whatever. OK, cool. You're actually not that hairy. No hard feelings. I'm not really into... pretentious whiteys either. Did you read what it says on the back? Parvis, do you have a girlfriend? I need tips for getting with German girls. I don't know, maybe you should... just be yourself. OK, thanks. You hardly good at that. Good at what? Getting girls? No. Thanks. I just understand why I need to comfort someone with German papers. What? Why didn't you just say you were working here? Sorry. Yeah, I guess I should've said. Doesn't matter. Hi Maretta. How's it going? Super good, yeah. I wanted to ask you about this party... Do you need any help with it? Not at all, I'm easy. I have nothing else to do. Of course. No, that's just how I speak. Casual. I have vouchers for that shisha bar. Wanna go? Maybe later. Why not now? I have to go. My mum loves to watch GZSZ. Do you know it? Is it good for learning German? - German? - Yeah. You already speak German. I mean for my brother. Yeah, I guess it is. GZSZ. Shall I tell him? Or will you? What's that supposed to mean? Sure, I can tell him. Whoever sees him first. "Hello, how are you? Everything OK?" "Did you sleep well? How's the weather? Are the children OK?" "Yes, thank you. And Parvis-Joon?" And I'm sitting right next to her. Signaling not to put me on the phone. Then she says, "Parvis? Sure, he's right next to me." "Of course. Wait, stay on the line." And she passes the phone. Do you know Texas? I was an old farmer. It's like Germany. Do you want a beer or something else? Wine? I've missed you. I've missed you so much! Don't ever leave me again. My darling, my precious, my life. My baby was brave enough to come out! Do you know this one? - Hey. - This is Parvis. Amon. You've meet, right? - Aren't you going to say hello? - Hello. Not the German way. Iranian! Or don't you know how? I don't expect you to know. It's two kisses. Come on, boys! He doesn't know, he's German. It's good to see you. Three would've been even better. Some do four. Quiet! Everyone be quiet! Attention! Please listen. This boy, sitting right here. This man. He's my little brother. And soon, he will own everything here. This restaurant, Hildesheim, and all of Hanover will belong to him. No one on this rotten planet is as good as he is. My darling. You're so much better than everyone else. A round of applause! Bravo! Hi. Hi. Could I maybe get your number? It's a gingko. The most awesome plant in the world. I can even help people with Alzheimer's to remember. How old is it? Three hundred million years. Do a little dance for us. You know I can't dance. This boy can't dance like an Iranian. What's that supposed to mean? - Show him the Iranian flavor. - You can do better than that. - Without any music? - Don't be embarrassed! Wow! He's good, isn't he? This one time we went to Isfahan. There was an old bridge with wet rock below it. And I was playing on those rocks. Jumping from one to the next. Then I slipped and fell in the water. My clothes were totally soaked. And my father... He was staring at me from the side, and he started yelling: "Parvis, I told you you would slip and fall in the water! It was obvious. I told you!" And all the people passing by on the bridge stopped and yelled: "Child, why are you even playing here? Of course you were going to slip and fall, you fool!" As if I hadn't realized the rocks were slippery. Did you like Iran? Yeah, but it was strange how everyone spoke English to me. When we got back to Germany I stopped calling myself as Iranian. Why? I don't know. I think I am many different things. You're lucky you don't have to decide. I have to pee. - Sorry, where's the bathroom? - Right there. OK. Could you please... stop talking to me at the shelter? Who's that? Nobody. Hi, Amon. Do you maybe want to hang out outside the shelter sometime? I could help you study German... Your sister said you're really bad, so... Oh God. I have some old-school books at home, in case you're ever in the neighborhood. Are you praying? No. - What are you doing here? - Picking you up. Where are we going? You know that feeling when you wake up and all you want to do is party? Are you two texting? Yeah. PARVIS: Up for an over-30s costume party? Well, not really. I'm texting his sister. Show me. PARVIS: I had fun last night, thanks! BANA: So did we. You're really cool. PARVIS: Up for an over-30s costume party? Over-30s? You asshole! I know to asked for my number, but I was surprised you called. Oh, wait a second... I don't really speak much Farsi. My parents never spoke it with me. Good evening. Two Pino Grigios, please. The mixed appetizer platter. And do you have those wasabi peanuts? - Yes? Lovely. - Coming up. Thank you. Or do you not drink alcohol? I do. I just thought you'd ask what I wanted. Sorry! I'm really sorry. That was... - It's OK. - We could also go with red? BANA: Help! He's gross! PARVIS: It's really cool here. Well, it would be if you came. PARVIS: Location sent. Still coming? Parvis? My drink. That's my drink. I thought you moved away. Nope. You? What does it look like? You're a month early for Pride! Plenty of time left for you to come out then. Parvis? What's up? Need some help? I think... It must be something I ate. Have you been here long? It's really cool you came. Like, really crazy. Look at this. - Are those old photos? - Yeah. - Oh my God, look. - Show me. I wanna see. Should we go now? Maybe we should stay with him for a bit. Go check on him then. Are you OK in here? I see you. I know. Could you please hold this? Can I tell you one little thing? The other day I imagined us dying together. Or the stuff before. - You must be Banafshe. - Yes, hello. - And you're Mina? - Nice to meet you. - Banafshe-Joon. - Hi. Drink plenty of water, your head will thank you. Are you watching me? No. Where's Bana? I think she left. Real pretty. What were you dressed up as last night? You don't know Sailor Moon? The guardian of love and justice! Never heard of it. Why do you never speak German? Don't you feel comfortable? No. It's difficult enough to be myself. But to then do it in German... I sometimes feel my parents can't really understand me. What? Because of you accent? Come on, is it really that bad? Are they home right now? My parents? Don't think so. Why? - Some lavashak, Banafshe? Fresh from Iran. - Oh no, thank you. - No need for taarof. - No, really. Thank you. It's good in the morning. You seem really happy here. It hasn't always been like this. Things were very different when we first came here. After Mina was born, I sat by her crib all day, sewing. - For years... - You were a seamstress? Not a professional one. But I had learned it in Iran and it was a good way to make money. So that's what I did. And Parvis' dad... - What did he do? - He was assigned jobs by the job center. Sweeping streets during the day, and working at a nearby sausage factory at night. He spend all night on the assembly line. Years later we got lucky and took over a small supermarket. That was when Parvis came. I used to take him to work in the stroller. - He was with you at the supermarket? - He grew up there. Sometimes I think Parvis doesn't realize how much we've worked for him to have this life today. I'm sure he doesn't. I remember his sleeping face so well. Sleeping when we went to work in the morning and when we came home. - Amon ! - I'm sorry. Wait... Wait, you don't have to go. Amon, wait. - Your phone was ringing. - What did you say to him? Why do you just walk in like that? I didn't say anything! What's wrong with you, Parvis? Make sure my beautiful arms are in the the picture. Did you shave them? Of course not, you moron. I bought this special foam. - Did you take it? - Why would you do that? Man, you're so dumb. German women aren't into hairy men. My friend took a girl home the other day, but when she saw his hairy chest, she left immediately. Why are you laughing? What does "SIM card activation" mean? My dearest. Our beautiful boy. Have you even had sex? Your sister doesn't count. Only joking, man. - But where were you last night? - What do you care? What do you care? What do you mean? I'm just worried about my brother. - Maybe you hang out with the wrong crowd. - Don't touch me. Come on, tell me. I was out in the city. Who with? A girl from German class. Nice pants. Do you find it exciting hiding like this? Because I don't. Banafshe? Yeah? Could you help me for a second. I can't find that doc anymore. No idea where it's gone. OK... - Here it is. - Great. You're the best. If that's all, I'll get going. I heard about your deportation order. You know we really tried everything, with the appeal and all? Yeah. Did you ever consider a marriage of convenience? Then you could stay with your brother. Yeah, but who would do that? I would. Of course I would have to be the center of your life for a while. You'd have to know everything about me. My favorite food, the names of my brother and sisters, the size of my dick. We would need to do it soon as well, while your status is still legal. PARVIS: Let's take some better pics on your birthday I used to feel like... we just weren't able to start moving. And now... Amon... I have to tell you something. I can't stay here any longer. Can't you stay until I'm asleep? OK. Amon, you look like someone from some cheesy coming-of-age movie. Do you want to sleep over again tonight? At your parents' house? That's why I want my own place. Our own place? - Do you know what I want? - What? This. - What are you doing here? - Shut the fuck up. Who do you think you are? Our savior? - You can't even speak Farsi properly. - Calm down, OK? Leave it, Parvis! This is not about you. We don't have to hide. Just shut up. Did he get to fuck you already? You dirty piece of shit. - I know you like it. - You piece of shit. I feel sorry for your parents. What's going on here? I'm gonna kill you! Fuck off. Just leave me alone. Nothing has changed, Bana. Shut the fuck up. Please. Mum... Wake up. Three-Room, Light-Flooded apartment in the heart of Teheran Mum, go to bed. Go up to bed. Good night. PARVIS: Can you please call me? I want to talk to you. Are you disappointed with me? I just wish I could understand you better. What do you want to know. Mum? I don't understand why you don't share what's in your head, and why you don't learn from your family's experiences. When could I have done that? At night, when you got home from work? Can you see we did all this for you? We've never really felt like we belong here. And to think you now feel the same way makes all our work over the last 30 years seem worthless. Mum, I do belong here. But I need to live my own experiences. OK, we don't disturb you next time. It's probably not that easy for them living here either? I don't think it's any easier in Iran for someone who's... Is there even a word for it in Iran? For "gay"? A word for "gay"? Yes, for "gay". Yes. "Hamjenssgara". "Hamjenssgara?" Why do you want to go back? I don't get it. Your father's home is still the place we left 30 years ago. Not here, where we have lived. Iran is still our home. I'm sorry. If you don't leave voluntarily, they will schedule the deportation. So they rejected my appeal? Yes. For what reason? Please talk to him. I've been saving some money. We could try Switzerland? What are you talking about? Go through all this shit again? Yes. Why not? Why not? My love. Look at me. What am I here for then? I'm sorry. What for? Falling in love with my brother? Or for German being just as shitty as Iran? Do you think I could see him? He's sleeping. Now's not a good time. Could you give him this then? OK. Because... tomorrow's my last day here. They're going to deport me. Both of you? I'll give him this. The other day mum told me she was worried that I don't belong here. And? Do you? I don't know. Some days I really feel like I do. I feel like yelling it in people's faces: "I am the future!" But then some days I feel like... we're just reminders of Mum and Dad's pain. Banafshe? Listen... The police are on the way. Amon! Get up. You need to get up. - What's happening? - Nothing. We need to leave. Come on, put this on. - What's now? - I called Parvis. He's waiting outside. I don't know what to do. You thought I wouldn't be able to handle it? You have to let me be there for you from now on, OK? We stick together. Maybe this is a weird thought, but... I'm really sorry we were born into such different lives. This isn't about you, Parvis. Since we came here, I feel like I always experience everything twice: Once as the person I could have been, and once as the person I am today. This world is ours! Are you scared of the future? Yes. Are you? Not usually. Will you promise me something? What? That you'll keep an eye on Amon for me? I promise. Thank you. Yes? Where's Bana? She went for a walk. Don't stop seeing me, OK? Sorry, I missed the right moment to say goodbye. Fuck, this guy is staring at me because I'm crying into his phone. I bet he thinks you just broke up with me. My heart. We'll have each other for the rest of our lives. You'll hear from me soon. Now I really have started to move. And so have you. The future is ours.
