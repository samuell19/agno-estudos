Gentlemen. The Senator for Massachusetts, Mr Daniel Webster has the floor. This dangerous and destructive doctrine .. Dignified by the name 'State's Rights' is not new to us, gentlemen. Shall any single state deny within its boundaries .. A Federal law designed for the good of an entire Union? I say never. But the Senator from Virginia .. Claims his sovereign state will not swallow distasteful laws .. Hatched by the bluenoses of Massachusetts and Connecticut. I don't think I said quite that, Dan. Perhaps I put it better than you did. But the point is .. Will Virginia abide by the constitution or not? I recognise Senator Randolph. Thank you, Mr President. The constitution. Is it holy writ? Let me tell you that the state of Virginia .. Will not submit to any violations of our sovereign rights. Be it an unfair tax on tobacco, an illegal tariff .. Or any other ill-conceived and ruinous law. Perhaps he will defy the federal government by force? Virginia profoundly hopes that will never become necessary, sir. Virginia. You are first a Virginian, John Randolph of Roanoke. And second, an American. I am a better American because I am first a Virginian, Mr Yankee Webster. I thought we did very well in the senate today, John. Yes, Dan. I must admit you were in very good voice. Although you made no more sense than usual. Nevertheless, I repeat .. That's just the trouble, Dan. You always repeat. John. You and Calhoun are at the bottom of this. Yes. This treasonable business. Logic is not treason, Dan. Come on. It's time for my constitutional before dinner. Constitutional? I am surprised you would even use the word. What-ho, my old lad. I say. A blooming prince, as I live. Major, shake hands with Professor Leroy Sunderland. My own blood cousin, I'm proud to have you know. Welcome, Professor. Welcome to our humble inn. I'm delighted, sir, to find a welcome in such a charming haven of tranquillity. Sounds like a ruddy lark. Allow me to introduce myself, Major. Lieutenant Bow Timberlake of the US Navy. Known and adored by women of all nations. And willing to accept board and lodging for a nominal sum. If any at all. This way to the taproom, gentlemen. - Yes. Thank you. Come, Professor. We'll all drink with you. In fact, on you. What? You won't even drink to the memory of an Algerian muscle dancer? I need no false stimulus to quicken my inspiration. Nature is too gracious a benefactor to .. But nature is not a magician. Why didn't say we had company, father? Gentlemen, my daughter Peg. Professor Sunderland. - How do you do. Lieutenant Timberlake. - How do you do, sir. Better, thanks. Much better. A pleasant ending to a rather unpleasant journey, Miss O'Neale. We do hope you will be comfortable, gentlemen. Well, Miss Peggy. Have you shaped any new political doctrines today? Mr Webster, I am nothing but an impressionable young woman. My dear, you should have been born a man. Oh no, Mr Webster. Oh no, Mr Webster. Senator Daniel Webster. Lieutenant Timberlake. Both defenders of the constitution. And you swore an oath on it, young man. Don't forget that. Yes, sir. They are pretty buttons. Are they real gold? Solid gold. From the mines of King Solomon. Yours for the asking. No. You needn't ask. I'll cut them off and string them for you. Tonight. Yes, Major. An interesting head, your daughter. Graceful, intelligent. - And level. I should place your cranium in the Franz Bellum class. A tender friend. A dangerous enemy. You know, I may find your future for you amid the mysteries of the stars tonight. If .. if the moon is full. What day of the month is this, Professor? A dark sailor will enter your life. Almost immediately. Gentlemen, I regret this is the evening I always make out the accounts. And tomorrow night .. there is no moon. John, I want to talk to you. Oh Dan, let's not have any more flag waving. Very well. But I warn you the stars and stripes remains the symbol of the Union. Not a pocket handkerchief for you Virginians or anybody else. Listen to me, Dan. If this Union of yours is going to destroy the rights .. Of the sovereign state of Virginia then I say let's have done with the Union. John Randolph. That is treason. If it weren't for the Union there would be no states. Tell me. These senators and such. They discuss quite a few confidential matters with the young lady, don't they. So what if they do? Well, she might be a useful little person for me to know. Listen to me, my fine, feathered rogue. We'll have none of your underhanded bribery and corruption around here. We won't. We won't. - Shush. Talk like that and you won't stay here. - Margaret. Don't 'Margaret' me. I know what I say. - No you don't. You're not old enough. You wait until Andy Jackson gets here. He'll settle you and your 'State's Rights'. Andrew Jackson will be the first to agree with me. He will, will he? Very well then. You can count me as the last. I had no idea politics could be so exciting, gentlemen. Lieutenant Timberlake of The Constitution. This is Senator Randolph of Virginia. How do you do, sir. - How do you do. Have a drink. Of Senator Webster's New England rum. Smuggled from Jamaica before Massachusetts was a state. Well, even a sailor should be able to feel that. Are you going to be with us long, Lieutenant? Well, I hadn't intended to, but .. I find it strangely interesting. You mean Margaret? A curious girl. Or a woman. I rarely know which. I sometimes think she knows more about politics than I do. Certainly more than .. You're forgetting her best points, aren't you? No. I'm not forgetting anything. It seems to me you are. No. No. I have an eye trained for opportunities like this. A lonely sailor. A pretty little tavern girl. A moonlit night. There's really not .. Gentlemen. What the devil did I say? You said .. Just like you, John. You strike before you think. I'm sorry, Lieutenant. You didn't say anything really. I suppose I can't get over thinking of Margaret as a little girl in pigtails. I forget sometimes that others may look at it differently. From now on I'm not going to look at her at all. Don't say that. She'll scratch my eyes out. I am very sorry. Will you drink? - Thank you. To Miss O'Neale, sir. In whom I am more interested in than ever. Now Peggy, why won't you be reasonable? If you won't marry me who will? - How much is 9 times 65? Minus one day's lodging. Plus 1, 2, 3, 4 juleps and two carafes. I don't know. I don't lodge and I don't drink. Much. I just ask you a simple favor. To marry me. And you sit there and count. Rowdy. We owe Daniel Webster two dollars and twenty cents for staying here. That can't be right. - Peggy, will you please listen to me? So that is the reason. That is who it is. Don't you ever dare say that again. - Well, I say it because it is true. You've been mooning about him since your mud-pie days. What good has it done you? He doesn't even know you are grown up. - Oh, doesn't he? Well. I don't care whether he does or not. He doesn't mean anything to me. Not even that. You are trembling all over. You've made a blot right there. Rowdy. You go home, duck your head in ice-cold water .. And ask heaven to forgive you. - For what? I don't see why you get so upset just because I see what anyone can see. Will you please have some sense? I'm the daughter of an Innkeeper. He is the first gentleman of America. He doesn't even know that I .. Know what? Nothing. Now go on him and let me get on with my work. Go on. Alright. Alright. Very well. Here's the kitchen account, Peg. Don't forget. General and Mrs Jackson arrive tomorrow. I couldn't forget that. Numbers 17 and 18 aired? Aired, scrubbed and varnished. Or the general would skin me alive. Almost finished? It's late. No. I have had a few interruptions. Ahoy. Venus. Two points to starboard. Full sail ahead. Ah, to be ashore again. To know you've waited all these lonesome years. Unloved, uncherished, unkissed. My faithful darling. I promise never to leave you again. Tomorrow. Yes. Tomorrow I shall marry you twice. Not tomorrow. It is wash day. Then I shall stay out to sea and wait until you signal me. With a freshly laundered pillow slip. Make it two, my love. Goodnight, Major. Or may I call you 'father'? Ah, yes. Yes. I should place her cranium in the very nexus spot. May you dream of me tonight. And awaken disturbed. Goodnight, pirate. I tell you what, father. I'll trade you my new slave for that. He is a likeable cuss. Half man, half typhoon. Well, goodnight, dear. - Goodnight, father. Don't forget to lock up. No. I won't. Margaret. Haven't you gone to bed yet? We are just closing up. You are still angry with me. Your political opinions are forgiven, Margaret. What about my other opinions? Well, I should say the sailor is the best of the lot. Oh. The sailor? John. - Yes, Margaret? Nothing. John. Now what? What makes you think the sailor is the best of the lot? Well, don't you? He is very nice and gay, but .. But what? Nothing. Goodnight, Margaret. Now, Rachel. It ain't nothing, General. I ain't worried. Them social spew-cats can't bother you none. I am Senator Jackson now. You could be President Jackson and it wouldn't stop them, Andy. There's nothing so mean and vicious in this world as the way women act .. Toward someone they look down on. Yes. And when a woman looks down on somebody .. In most cases it's because she doesn't look up to it. So let them hate. Let them stew in their own poisonous juice. I used to wonder why it was. But I don't now, no more. I just guess it's mostly because I am married to the best man in this country. And they know it. You are danged right that is what it is. They're just jealous of you. That's all. Welcome, sir. A pleasant journey? Awful. Keep on moving. Well, Major. I see you and your pest-ridden hotel ain't burned up yet. Not yet, General. But now that you are here .. Where's that scrubby brat of yours, huh? Where is Peg? She is still lying in bed, I'll warrant. She ought to be up and getting breakfast for a man. I am glad to see Mrs Jackson that you've been able to survive. Well, Major. After living with the general you get so toughened up you can finally stand him. Stand me? Why, you bulldozing young termagant. She has been browbeating me all over the state of Tennessee. Uncle Andy. It's about time. That is enough of that kissing. I've missed you, Rachel. Come on. Hustle me up some breakfast. Ah, leave her be, General. Aren't you proud to be Mrs Senator Jackson? I am just proud to be Mrs Jackson. Hello, Andrew. Well, John Randolph. Still hanging around, huh? Yes. Glad to see you back in the fold. - What fold? Well, blue-nose. Well Andrew, I am delighted to see you. Delighted. Where is that rocking chair? Coming right in, General. Like a blinking flash. Come on. Come on, son. Hurry up. Here. Give it to me. There you are, young woman. - Thank you. Now, you are home again. What are you waiting around here for? You got your orders, ain't you? Yes, sir. Four fried eggs. Two slices of ham and toast. That thick. Well, don't tell me about it. Go and get it for me. It ain't good for you, General, to rampage on an empty stomach. I ain't rampaging, my love. The girl is just a no-good, lazy .. Impudent, poxy, scurvy but bewitching hussy. By the Eternal, I will not stand it. I will .. I'll hamstring her and tear her mongrel tongue out. But by the Eternal, I reckon she would still talk. Yes, sir. She would. I wouldn't get him too foamed up, honey. Who is foamed up? I ain't foamed up, my love. I'm just as cool as .. - As the hinges on the jaws of .. I'll do my own swearing, young lady. Go on. Give me a kiss. And git. Ain't it a little bit cold in here, General? Hey, boy. Get that stove started. Yes, sir. No, my love. In just a minute. It will be as nice and warm in here as the Tennessee sunset. Hey. Look out what you're doing with that stove there. If Ben Franklin could have stuck to his politics .. Instead of inventing a new-fangled fire-fighting service .. There. That is all you had to do. You addlepated pot-walloper. Go on, git out! General, I is already gitting .. Come and take your spleen out on this ham and eggs. Now, may I 'git' too? I have work to do. If all the trees were bread and cheese what would we do for drink? If all the seas were beans and peas .. What would we do for sailors? Ahoy. Venus. This is our wedding day. Tell me, Lieutenant. Do you have a wife in every Inn as well as every port? What a lucky girl. To love me so madly and .. And have me so near. Horrible weather. It is raining sailors. I think perhaps I'd better go in out of the rain. Oh no. A form of paralysis? They do look a little awkward, don't they. Perhaps if they had something to hold .. - Thank you, Lieutenant. You don't mind, do you? - Mind what? My talking the way I do. It isn't disrespect. Well, in a way I am .. I am afraid of you. Sorry if I frighten you. I've looked at loveliness. The sun and the moon. The seven seas and the five continents. Drunk and sober. In love and out. And never have I see anything to compare with you. In this courtyard. This minute. Don't. I asked you not to. There was no power on earth to stop me. Remember this, Peggy. As long as you live, no man can kiss you once without wanting to kiss you again. Margaret. What are you doing here? John. I hope you're not walking in your sleep. You're not being funny, John Randolph. I am not trying to be. I am trying to understand how .. We've got to face things you and I. The truth. Can't we face it just as well tomorrow? - No. Now. Alright. Let's face it. What is the truth, Margaret? You know, I have often wondered. Does it mean anything to you that I love you? But you can't possibly. But I do. Are you the only one in Washington who doesn't know it? Well, now you know it. Margaret, wait a minute. - No. I have waited. All it does is give you more chances to misunderstand me. To disapprove of everything I do. But I don't, Margaret. I have only tried to help you. Always. Ever since you were a little girl and I caught you climbing up a tree .. In your pantalettes, and your father after you with a paddle. Margaret, dear. I am very fond of you. You love me? Please realize you are too young to .. - No. I am not only too young for politics. I am too young to love too. Maybe you think Rowdy was talking to a child when he asked me to marry him. Perhaps Bow Timberlake would rather have given me a doll today than a kiss. Oh, John. John, I have loved you ever since I was old enough to spell the word. Now I am old enough to tell you so. Margaret, dear. You are wrong. Please try to understand. You just said it yourself. Love is just a word. A word you couldn't spell once. And now you can. How could you possibly know that you love me? I do know, John. I love you. I am sorry Margaret, but I don't love you. You are a liar, John Randolph. Aren't you a liar? If you don't mind, Margaret. I would rather you didn't beg. Funny, isn't it. What is? That I can love you so and hate you so at the same time. Are they worth a penny? What? - Your thoughts. No. Not even a penny. You couldn't have been thinking of me. Well. Have you .. It's a lovely ride, isn't it. That isn't what you were going to ask me. I know it isn't. - What is it? Have you ever been in love? Well, what do you mean by in 'love'? I mean, in 'love'. Are there different meanings to the word? As many as there are men and women in the world, I imagine. Could you be in love with me? Could I? - Oh. I don't mean that. I mean. Could you believe .. That is, if I told you. Could you believe that I loved you and that I knew I loved you? There's only one reason why I couldn't. I know the reason. - No, you don't. I couldn't Peggy because I don't believe in prayer. I have been praying that you loved me. Don't you remember, Lieutenant? I was to dream of you and wake disturbed. Oh yes. Well I had a wonderful dream myself. Shall I tell you about it? - Well, if you think you should. Rowdy. I want to hear. I think you'd better for Maybelle's sake. Alright then. I dreamed that .. I had no sooner whispered your name .. Than you smothered me with kisses that burned little red hearts over my face. And then we .. We gradually got married and had 64 children all at once. Would you mind if we got married all at once and had the 64 children gradually? Well .. wait until you hear about the dream I had. Oh, Rowdy. What makes you dream? I guess I ate something bad. Oh, Rowdy. Bow. Bow. We can't go back in all this. Why, you would never get half the way. No, never. That's why I had it turned on. I'll fix everything. You leave it to the navy. Frau Oxenrider. Yah? Orders from the quarterdeck. I have it. If I bundle you in all together. I have enough room for all of you to sleep here. That's a great idea. How did you happen to think of it? Are you going to shove us all together in one room? Yah. Come on children, together. Let's choose partners. I pick you, Rowdy. Who do you pick? Maybelle, I think you'd better go and help Frau Oxenrider. Goodbye. Now Peggy, this is only fair. I brought you here as much as he did. Well, never let it be said that a Timberlake is unsporting. Here we are. Heads I win. Tails you win. Is it a bargain? - No, no. Very well. If you let me do the tossing. What's up with you? Look at the chance I take. Look at the chance I am taking. - Yeah. Look at the chance she's taking. Young Paul Jones. As fine a head as our great navy has ever seen. Paul Jones, eh? You navy men sure stick together, don't you. Rowdy. Maybelle went upstairs. You're sure? - Yes. Good. I am going to the taproom. Aren't you a little ashamed of yourself? What would Admiral Jones think? Come, darling. I have to bundle you in. Yes. There's surely something definitely wrong with this arrangement here. I think with a little fixing it will .. What is that? That is just a knife. I always take it to bed with men in case of fire. Well, there won't be any fire tonight. Hear that? It's thunder. That is what it sounds like. It is really my heart. You are obviously in need of quiet. Goodnight, Admiral Jones. Goodnight, Venus. One white sheep. Two white sheep. Three white sheep. - And one black sheep. Go to sleep. Yes. Sleeping? Like a baby. Dreaming? A very unhappy dream. About me? A very lonely dream too. Why lonely? Because you weren't dreaming about me. I wasn't asleep. That's why. Well then. Could you dream about me? I could if you wanted me to. We could each dream about the other. Then we would meet in our dreams. We would meet in our dreams. In the courtyard under the tree. Whoever gets there first waits on the other one. I'll be there first. Don't worry. I'll hurry as fast as I can. Right into my arms. Oh. It is only a dream. Then we kiss. In a dream? Dreams are so nice. Morning, Major. Spring is in the air this morning, Senator. Major you have the soul of a poet. Spring is in the air. Beautifully put. Speaking of beautiful things, where is Miss Margaret? Probably upstairs with Mrs Jackson. Let me know the instant she comes down. And where is happy Dan Webster? In the taproom, I suppose? Out walking. With young Timberlake here. - Timberlake? Is he in there? A nice boy. Our finest type of sailor, that boy. Morning, young man. Well just in time. I was afraid I would have to drink alone. Some of Senator Webster's private stock. I am in a rummy mood this morning. For your information, sir. Or even without it. To love. It's an institution. Lieutenant, you too have the soul of a poet. To love. As an institution. Hasn't a change come over you, Senator? - Do you think so? Well, perhaps I've come to my senses. I have. I've seen the dawn of a new and a better life. As a matter of fact I owe it all to you. To me? Yes. Don't you remember the little talk we had about Peggy a while ago? Talk? Peggy? I find it rather hard to forget. Oh. So your new and better life has to do with Margaret? I have been pretty obvious, haven't I? No, no. Not so. I suppose it was just the logical conclusion. I haven't said something wrong again, have I? No. I mean I want to marry Peggy and .. It couldn't by any chance be me you object to? You are quite sure that she loves you? Yes. I know she does. Marriage, honey. It ain't a party dress. You got to wear it morning, noon and night. But Bow says if I don't marry him right away he will .. The best of 'em spout weasel juice when spring gets in 'em. But he is so alive. Always laughing, always warm. And tender. I am sure he isn't pretending. Aren't you, aunt Rachel? If you ain't dead sure yourself, honey. I wouldn't be hurrying things. Who is that, Peg? John Randolph. John is a good enough friend of yours to be helping you decide. Now ain't he, honey? Yes. Yes, thank you. Hello. Oh. I'm glad I found you here. Why? - Well, because .. Because I wanted to ask you a very important question. Yes? Well .. a young man. A young gentleman has asked me to marry him. It's Bow Timberlake, John. He .. I .. You and he have faced the truth together. Is that it? Oh, please. Perhaps it is because everyone else in Washington knows it, so why shouldn't I? Margaret, why do you come to me? Obviously he is in love with you. You must love him. So that's an end of it. Have you forgotten that I'm too young to know what love is John Randolph? Then find out by all means. Marry him. The quicker the better. Before you meet someone else who takes your fancy. Thank you for your advice. And you needn't worry. I will take it. My congratulations, Lieutenant. - Thank you, sir. And Mrs Timberlake. Thank you. - Goodnight. Mrs Timberlake. - Yes. Here. You'd better let me have the certificate. But why? - Well .. You would only lose it. - No, I wouldn't. Really. [ Laughter ] [ Laughter ] General. - Huh? Andy. - What? Wake up. - What is it? What's the matter? A fire? No. Listen. It's coming from Peggy's room. [ Laughter ] Rampaging, huh? It sounds more like gallivanting than rampaging to me. Gallivanting? We'll have none of that. No, Andy. Not your pistols. Think of her good name. I am, my love. I am. [ Laughter ] Uncle Andy. Come out of there, you shameless baggage. I'm not a shameless baggage and this is my room. Did I hear someone knock? By the Eternal .. What are you doing in her room? Now don't you touch him, uncle Andy. - I'm not afraid of him. After all, a husband has a perfect right to .. Husband, eh? None of your sailor's tricks now. Yes. But we have the certificate. We can prove that we're married. Prove away then. I am awaiting. Peggy. You must have the certificate. I don't think so darling but I'll look. Well? Don't you remember? He gave it to you. He did? Well? I am tired of waiting. Don't shoot, Andy. You'll wake up the whole Inn. Well, here it is. I've had it in my pocket all the time. 'Certificate of Marriage. This is to certify ..' Let me read that. Andy, you know you are as blind as a bat without your specs. Won't you let me .. You read it then. I haven't gotten mine either. And we are both as blind as bats without our specs. Well. Let me read it for you. 'Certificate of Marriage'. 'This certifies that Lieutenant Bow Timberlake of the United States Navy.' 'And Margaret O'Neale, Spinster of Washington DC'. 'Were, by me on the 6th day of May 1823 joined in the bonds of holy matrimony'. 'Signed: Maurice Andrew. Minister of the Gospel'. So there. Well. Looks alright. I ought to give you a danged-good hiding though for running off and doing it. Here. Hang that up where everyone can see it. Well Mrs Jackson you've got us into a nice pickle. Meddling and messing around. I reckon we'd best go back to bed, Andy. I reckon we'd better never left it. Bow. Look what you gave him. Yes. I know. Those are my sailing orders. Why didn't you tell me you were going away? Only for three little months, darling. I couldn't let them spoil our one night together. As our friend Webster would put it .. For the preservation of this glorious union .. I would lay down my life. Remember that in the next port you reach. Bow. Bow, dear. It isn't fair for you to go away when we've just been married. Only to return in a few months. Ten times a lover. Three times a husband. And twice the fool. Laden with pearls, pieces of gold, fine laces. And kisses. Kisses warmed in the bright sun of the Caribbean. And all for you. If not all, at least save the best for me. Peggy! Yes? I'm blowed if The Constitution ain't crept up the Potomac like a .. Like a ruddy great ghost. Really, Cuthbert? But, how wonderful. Let's surprise him. Come on. Here. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Yes? Mrs Timberlake has come aboard, sir. Will you see her? Yes. Show her in please. Mrs Timberlake. Where is Bow? Why isn't he here? Please sit down. You might as well tell me. Something has happened to him? 'On June 22nd, Lieutenant Timberlake'. 'While gallantly leading a raiding party on the island of Kalakaibo'. 'Somehow became separated from his men'. 'We are not fully aware of the cause of the tragedy'. 'Lieutenant Timberlake was buried at sea, as he would have wished'. 'On the 24th day of June 1823'. Hangman Andy. Hangman all through life. How many weddings does it take to really make a wife? Heaven forbid. Yes. Heaven forbid. - We shall know tonight .. Whether our government shall be headed by a statesman or a common soldier. What's that you said, mother? I said .. I remember Mr Washington. He was a soldier. Oh, mother darling. General Washington was a gentleman soldier. There are no such things. Soldiers are soldiers. And I like them. I'm sure General Jackson represents the kind of pioneer that we should admire. But Mrs Jackson .. Andy's Rachel. I caught a glimpse of her this afternoon. She had carelessly left her pipe at home. What's that you said, mother? I said, who are you vultures hacking to pieces now? We were discussing the 'Backwoods Belle'. Mrs Rachel Jackson. I suppose you want to compare her with Martha Washington? Never having met the lady I can't say anything. All I know is, the general picked her. But he didn't pick her. She picked him. She set her cap for him so obviously and in such a hurry. That she married him before her divorce from her first husband was legal. But they married again as soon as they found out about it, didn't they. Anybody can make a mistake. Really, mother darling. Sometimes you absolutely shock me. That was not a mistake. That was a moral sin. As everybody knows. Nobody knows it. You least of all. I wouldn't yell so loud about something I knew nothing about. I am sorry I shocked you. If you minded your own business more maybe I'd shock you less. I am going to take my nap. Good afternoon. Oh, where is Rowdy? He promised to bring the returns the minute he heard. It must have reached his newspaper by now. Did I ever mention how graceful you are? No. I'll mention it now then. You are like a gazelle. What are you talking about? You. I have been for months. Remember me? I am that charming Senator Eaton. John Eaton. Today is no time for small talk. You are not small talk, Peggy. You are important conversation. We've got hours before the first definite news can reach here. Relax. I am relaxed. You're the one who should be excited. After all, uncle Andy wants you as his Secretary of War. Not me. My thoughts were so far from war. - And peace? And the hearts of my countrymen. Peggy. The Secretary of War .. to be. Is very much in love. A carriage. It's Rowdy. Rowdy is coming with news. John Randolph. May I come in, Margaret? Yes. Yes, please. I'm anxious to hear the first returns. I thought the Franklin Inn the most likely place to find them. You look at me as if I were a ghost, Margaret. You are not, are you? Have five years in Russia destroyed what little of the human I once possessed? John, how long have you been .. I mean that is .. Oh. Do you know Senator Eaton? We met the other day. How are you, Senator? Thank you. The other day? So you .. Peggy, we're all waiting upstairs. The General is .. Senator Randolph. - Major. Welcome. Your rooms will be aired immediately. I've taken a house near the capital, Major. It's more convenient. Fine, fine. But at least you'll have some refreshment? Peggy, will you escort the gentlemen upstairs. And I will call Senator Webster and Mr Calhoun. Then you have been back for quite some time? About a week. Peggy. Thank you, John. Thank you, John. You speak of the pride of your Southern states, yet allow the North to feed you. We think it proper and fitting. You admit then, we in the North are workers? And we of the South are gentlemen. Hasn't Dan stopped once in all these years? Not except for four days last year when he had the mumps. Martin Van Buren says Dan was born with a silver constitution in his mouth. You ain't ate a thing yet, Peggy. And I don't intend to until we hear from Rowdy. A fine newspaper he runs. Where is he? Hey, keep away from that window. Running over there every few minutes ain't going to .. Isn't. Well, isn't going to bring him here any quicker. There's a lot of grogshops between that newspaper office and here. Give me so more potato salad. - I'll get if for you, uncle Andrew. Say, you don't think Sarah is being so sweet to me .. Because she figures I'm going to get elected, do you? Now don't say things like that about your niece-in-law. Sarah is a very nice girl. Yes. She is indeed. A very nice girl. Only sometimes I almost wish I'd get beat .. So she would go back to Tennessee and leave me alone. Now don't get foamed up, General. I ain't foamed up my love. Thank you, Sarah. My pet. Shall we close these windows? No. I don't think so, John. It sounds like a happy crowd. You hear that? They are for uncle Andy. We've managed to keep the campaign filth from aunt Rachel. How, I don't know. But we have. If she knew the muck and slime they've thrown at her .. Aren't you going to speak to them, General? What as? I can't say I'm glad I am elected. I can't say I'm sorry I've lost. Yet. I don't want to go out there and just talk. What's wrong with just talking? Andrew. I have a headache. For the sake of my headache please show yourself. Use your influence, Mrs Jackson. We can't leave Dan Webster with a headache. What would Massachusetts say? Well at least my united head aches. My eyes, ears and nose .. Don't feel they have a separate right to withdraw from any inconvenient ache. But, pray use your influence nonetheless, Mrs Jackson. I tell you, gentlemen. The last time I used my influence on the general. We got married. So maybe he won't pay it as much mind as you think. I'll half mind, love. That is a challenge to my gallantry. Mrs Jackson, will you escort me to the balcony? Well anyhow, as far as the door, General. Boo. Boo. Boo. Hangman Andy. Hangman all through life. How many weddings does it take to really make a wife? Whatever I have done in the past. I have done because I considered it just and right. I will continue to do so until the end of my living days. How is your backwoods wife? How is she fixed for pipe tobacco, hangman? How do we know she is his wife? Your Rachel ain't fit for the White House. See that no harm comes to the General, Peg. Send for Mr Van Buren. Should we use soldiers, Mr Randolph? Fists, Mr Van Buren for this rabble. Give my regards to Pothouse Peg. Yes. Long live the hussy. Get out of it, Jackson. In the name of the constitution of the United States. I call upon you to desist and disperse. Webster, Webster. Massachusetts for ever. Speech. I call upon you to respect the person of Andrew Jackson. Seventh President .. Of the United States of America. Congratulations, Mr President. - I knew it. I knew you would win. Rachel. I must find Rachel. Are you hurt bad, Andy? No. It don't amount to anything. I had best just clean it up for you. - No, no. Don't you kneel to me, Andy Jackson. So, you are the President now. I've wondered how I would feel when the time came. Now here it is. I don't feel no different. I am proud of you and I love you. But then I have always been proud of you and I've always loved you. They'll lick your boots before I am through with them. The scum. It wasn't just them, was it Andy? It's been everybody all the time, hasn't it? No, no. For months now, they've been poking fun at me just to make you look ridiculous. They've been using all the filth they could make up about me. Just to make you look dirty. - Now, now. They've been using me to drag you down. They have been using me to drag you down. Oh, Andy. Why didn't you send me away? Because you belong here with me, honey. Because without you I couldn't go on. That's what I wanted you to say. Get me my pipe, Peg. One little puff can't do no harm. The doctor says no, aunt Rachel. No more pipe smoking. It is more than pipe smoking that ails me, honey. I know. I've known for some time. Don't tell Andy. I will never set foot in the President's new house. I wouldn't know how to act in it anyhow. Nonsense. You will be the grandest, sweetest first lady this country has ever had. No, darling. No. Peg. There are a few things I want to tell you and .. Maybe a favor I want to ask. These womenfolk around here .. Are going to make it awful unpleasant for you just like they did for me. Watch out for them, honey. Because the closer you get to the president. And I want you stand by him more than ever. The harder they are going to hate you. Because you are pretty and clever. Like as not, they will turn double strong agin you. But don't get scared. Smile at them and .. Keep going. I want you to promise. You will watch over the general for me. Don't be letting him rare up in his sinful tempers .. And if he does cut loose, just you say to him .. 'Your Rachel wouldn't hold with that, General'. And don't let him say 'ain't' and 'git' and 'gal'.. And don't let him cuss too much. I could never bear to have folks snigger at him. Like they have at me. He is the greatest man in America. And the people will know him. For a great President. You'll help him. Won't you, Peg? I promise. Look, Shirley. And my poor dear aunt scarcely cold in her grave. Uncle Andy. It's funny. Great sorrows are supposed to grow less .. with time. I've always heard that. Mine have increased though. Hour by hour. Day by day. Mine have grown until .. At moments like this .. I can think of nothing. I can feel nothing but .. Rachel. She must be thinking of you too. You are together at moments like these. Well. It ain't enough, thataway. I want her here with me. By my side. Where she belongs. I want rest when I'm tired. And peace when I am worried. No, Rachel. I can't face it without you. But you have got to, uncle Andy. Why? Because it is my duty? I've done my duty ever since I was old enough to lift a musket. Alright. I will do my duty as president. But this country needs something more than that. It wants a man how can fight. A man with a purpose who won't get licked. It wants old hickory. - Yeah. Old hickory. Well, he is dead. He died on December 22nd 1828. In Tennessee. At least, everything he lived for passed away that day. Rachel was so much smarter. She knew us all so much better than we knew her, uncle Andy. She knew the moment would come when you would want her and she wouldn't be here. She told me it would. And she left a message with me for you. She said to tell the general not to forget about .. 'Ain't' and 'git' and 'gal'. She said to say his country needs help now more than it ever needed it before. That it must be held together .. And unified into a nation to be proud of in the eyes of the world. And tell him that of everything he ever dreamed and planned .. This is the most important. And that this will be remembered of all of us, after all else is forgotten. He was a great man. And a great President. That sounds like Rachel. She'd be kinda proud of me, wouldn't she, Peg? She is proud of you this minute. I guess she is kinda happy about both of us. We are sticking together this way and we always will. I promised her that. Their gossip killed my Rachel, Peg. Their lying scummy tongues killed her .. Just as sure as if they'd stabbed her with a knife. And I swear now, by her memory. They will never do it again to anyone I love. Not as long as I've got one breath left in my body to stop them with. Gentlemen, the President. Sit down, gentlemen. I won't keep you long. I've asked you here as representatives of a certain group of states .. To discuss a matter pertinent to those states. Gentlemen. South Carolina has seen fit to disregard and violate a tariff bill .. That was created and instituted for the benefit of an entire Union. If you will pardon the use of the word 'Union'. A bill she honestly believes to be detrimental to her best interests. This morning I ordered sent to Charleston two warships. If she persists in flouting the dignity and authority of this government .. I shall despatch enough federal troops to make it clear .. That South Carolina is a state and not a republic. And is Virginia? Or will all the other states .. Be denied the rights granted them under the constitution of the United States? Is it your purpose to accomplish this union with warships and federal troops? It's my purpose, sir, to hold together and unify this country .. Into a nation to be proud of in the eyes of the world. Gentlemen. From the bottom of my heart, I hope this can be accomplished with dignity .. And the cooperation of 24 united states. But with our without it, it must be done. Not so long as this obvious prejudice against our part of the country exists. I must remind the senator that I am from Tennessee. I praise the president on his memory. - John, please. I shall cherish and respect my state until the end of my days. Second to my love and regard for the United States. I prefer to reverse the order of that allegiance. You have no such rights as an American. But every such right as a Virginian! Mr President. This is an issue upon which the entire future of our country stands or falls. If you insist on bringing it to a head. You must prepare yourself for secession. Nullification. - Or maybe civil war. The President of The United States. Gentlemen. I reckon you all know the great significance of this occasion. Believe me, gentlemen. I regret the new enemies I am about to make as much .. Yes. Even more perhaps than the new friends who will commend me for my actions. But there ain't. There isn't any such thing as victory without its accompanying sorrow. Gentlemen. When my eyes shall be turned the last time on the meridian sun. I hope I may see him shining bright .. On my united, free and happy country. I hope I shall never live to see his beams .. Falling on the dispersed structure of this glorious Union. I hope I may never see my country's flag .. With its stars separated or obliterated. Torn by commotion. And smoking with the blood of civil war. I hope I may never see the standard raised. Of separate state's rights. Star against star. And stripe against stripe. But that the flag of our union may keep its stripes. Corded and bound together in indissoluble ties. I hope I may see .. Spread all over my country's flag emblazoned in letters of light .. And floating proudly over land and sea. Union and liberty. Now and forever. One and inseparable. That, gentlemen. Before God .. Is my message to the people of America. Who constitute this glorious nation. Senator John Randolph of Virginia. Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts. The Secretary of War, the Honorable John Eaton. And Mrs Margaret O'Neale Timberlake. Charmed, madame. You were indeed kind to come. You might even say 'brave'. You'd better look out, Peggy. Their claws are out for you tonight. Margaret. - John. Senator Eaton. Rowdy. I'd begun to think you were off to Russia again. I was lost in the tariff question, Margaret. In many ways a more complete exile than Siberia. Am I to be saved a dance? The last one before supper. That's always the nicest and longest. Good heavens. Pothouse Peg. Did you hear? She made the president send poor Sarah Pearson back to Tennessee. Do you know any special reason why they should hate me so? Offhand, I can think of three. What are they? You are beautiful. Doubtful. But go on. You are clever. Definitely. That is only two. The third. You are a widow. And a dangerous menace to their peace of mind. Shall I give up being beautiful and clever? No. Then what do you recommend, Mr Secretary? You should give up being a widow, Mrs Timberlake. That's sweet of you, John. But for the present I must remain unselfishly a dangerous menace. And in my opinion, Margaret. Andrew Jackson has one dangerous weakness. An open mind. I call upon you with your influence, your wisdom, your tact. I resent that, sir. That slander. Rank slander against a defenceless woman. Retract that, sir. I have slandered no-one and I retract nothing. Very well. Rowdy. Not here please. Vice President or no Vice President, I will .. Rowdy, this is our dance. Our dance? - Yes. Our dance? - Yes. Come on. It's our dance. I beg your pardon, sir. But this here is the last dance before supper. You told me to tell you. - Thank you. Excuse me, gentlemen. Rowdy. Rowdy, something terrible has happened. John. Two o'clock. On a fair night moon. And all is well. It's a fair night moon. And all is well. Any coalition that she judges unsuited to her dignity and genius. You ask me, would I endanger the Union? I replied, gentlemen, there can be no union. To be founded on injustice. Or held together by force. [ Whistling ] Who is out there? Do you object to my sentiments? Or my voice? A voice puffed with vanity. A silver flute playing bass notes resounding nothing. Margaret. The night air was cold. May I have some sherry please? I seem to be forever breaking into your rooms in the middle of the night. Thank you. Aren't you? No thank you. I may say my reception was, if anything, a little more friendly the last time. So many books. So full of theories about life and everything in life. So like their master. Margaret, please. John. You've been away for five years. What were they like? Were they long years or short? Full or empty? What did you think about? What did you miss? What were you glad to be rid of? Or am I still too young to know? They were the five longest .. And most bitter years of my life, Margaret. Long, because each hour was a year. Each day an eternity away from you. And bitter because I can blame nobody but myself .. For driving away the only happiness I would ever have had. The only joy I would ever have known. That night when I came to your room to face the truth? I have come to you again, John. To explain to me why you danced with Rowdy? Still to face the truth. Margaret. Suddenly. For the first time, everything seems so right. We've lost so many years. Yes, dear. But found so many more. And so. I find it impossible to change my attitude .. Toward re-chartering the Bank of the United States. Uncle Andy. Copy that in your finest handwriting. We'll finish it later. Now, what is your excuse for violating the sanctity of this room? He loves me, uncle Andy. He loves me. Of course he does. Who? John. Well, well. So John Eaton has finally won his objective, huh? It's been a long siege. John Randolph. We are going to be married. John Randolph? It's been quite a time coming, hasn't it, Peg. You have loved him ever since you was a little brat in pigtails. Ever since I can remember. And probably before that. And now you got what you always wanted. Well, I think that is fine. I wish you all the happiness in the world. You don't sound very happy. You talk as though I were going away. Well, aren't you, Peg? But of course not. John and I are going to stay right here in Washington. I couldn't leave you, uncle Andy. There are ways of going away from me without leaving Washington. How? By marrying John Randolph. But that's not fair. I'm not trying to be fair. Simple because John Randolph believes in the rights of individual states. What about the rights of the United States? That is more than belief. It's something to dedicate your life to. Something you fight for. - I always have and I always will. My marrying John has nothing to do with it. Who are you going to fight with? Your cook, your coachman? The ladies of your sewing circle? - With Dan Webster. With Martin Van Buren. With you. As Mrs John Randolph? If we ain't being fair, let's be honest. Married to John Randolph. His interests will be your interests. His belief will be your belief. His loyalties will be your loyalties. And his love my love. His love, uncle Andy. It is something I have dreamed about. And cried about. Something I have prayed for. I've even begged for it. Can you possibly know what that means to me? I think I can. I have known a love to dream about. To cry about. I wouldn't desert you if I thought you really needed me, uncle Andy. I do need you, Peg. But for what? You are Andrew Jackson. The most powerful man in this country. Am I to make your decisions and win your battles for you? No. I don't need that kind of help. Then what do you need? I represent no constituency. I hold no office in your government. Neither did Rachel. You can't ask me to give up the man I have loved all my life. I reckon you are right, Peg. Well, good luck. Please try to understand, uncle Andy. I do, Peg. You have just found something that means more than anything .. Or everything else in the world to you. Let's not talk about Calhoun. Or Jackson. Or Dan Webster's constitution. Let's talk about how much we love each other. But it means I must turn my back on everything I've ever believed in. On what I feel best for the country I've loved even longer than I've loved you. Do it, Margaret. We've waited so long. We've misunderstood so much about each other. Be in love with me, Margaret. Forget about nullifications, secession, state's rights .. I couldn't forget about them. Any more than I could forget my love for you. And every now and then we could be husband and wife, couldn't we? When we weren't occupied being political opponents. How much simpler if we were political allies. But you have just said you couldn't desert Jackson. I don't intend to. But you, John. Perhaps you could give up a little state for a great country? Perhaps you could learn to prefer 24 united states too. Do you mean an exchange, Margaret? My political principles. Everything I stand for. For you? Is that Jackson's idea of a bargain? Jackson has nothing to do with it. But you can't ask me to make that choice, Margaret. They are my convictions. My beliefs. They are a man's reasons for being. His birthright. And so are mine. - But you're a woman, Margaret. And you are in love. Or aren't you? Perhaps that is what you really mean by this. That you don't love me. - No, John. That's not what I mean. It seems we've come to an impasse again. Something has got to give way. Our love or our convictions. I am afraid the choice is still yours, Margaret. I have tried to choose you, John. But I can't. If it means giving the other up. I am sorry. I have no other choice either. You see, in my way I am loyal too. May I have a glass of sherry? Yes, of course. Haven't you changed your brand? Why? It just seemed different. Perhaps a little bitter. No. It is very nice. Yes, Mrs Timberlake. That certainly was a great idea of yours, getting me on the Potomac. No Washington. No politics. No thinking. Sometimes it's a little hard to keep from thinking. It is a nice trip. - Hmm. What a pity that after inviting your entire cabinet .. Only John Eaton and Martin Van Buren were able to join you. Yeah. Well, the others were busy. The others are married. - Now, Peg .. It is no use, uncle Andy. You can't sell Pothouse Peg to the wives of your cabinet. Their blue blood curdles in their veins at the very mention of the hussy. They don't know anything about you, Peg. They didn't know anything about aunt Rachel. I've tried, uncle Andy. I've humiliated myself. I've called, knowing they were at home, to be told they were not. I've ignored insults, lies, gossip. Maybe they are right. Maybe you are wrong. Maybe you had better get yourself another unofficial First Lady. Well, Peg. I don't know anybody I like as much as you. Except maybe one. I might like her even better. Who? Mrs John Eaton. Mrs John Eaton? Nobody I know wouldn't be at home to the wife of the Secretary of War. Supper being served, Mr President. Thank you. Thank you. No man I know is finer or more loyal than John Eaton. I know. Nothing would give me greater confidence. Or fill my heart with more happiness. It's a beautiful night isn't it, Peggy. One of the loveliest. There is a moon too. A new moon. They're lucky for me. It was a new moon when I first came to the Franklin Inn. Many moons ago. They help in so many ways. A different moon for a different occasion. Some to dream on. Some to wish on. And this tonight? - To give me courage. Courage, John? The dauntless, fearless Secretary Eaton? At the moment, quaking in his boots. Fumbling for the words he's phrased and rephrased, written and rewritten. Peggy. There is no hope of success. Nothing to go by but my love for you and my faith in the moon. Peggy, will you marry me? Peggy? John. John, dear. Then you couldn't love me? You could? Would it make you happy, John Eaton? Look. I wonder why Randolph's house is up for sale. A strange fellow. Why wasn't he at our wedding? Surely he was asked, wasn't he? Yes. But he wasn't in Washington. You know, I never quite understood Randolph. Neither have I. Good evening, Senator. Good evening. It is about six years since we met. Yes. Unfortunately, I have a very good memory. Perhaps I will be more welcome when you hear my business. For many months, Senator, while you and your colleagues have worked in the open. We have worked in the dark. And the time has arrived to strike. In a dozen states our men await only the word to dissolve the union .. And free the states. So this is the way my principles .. And those of Mr Calhoun can be twisted to spell blood and rebellion. We know, Senator, that you and others in high places must proceed cautiously. But we also know that in your hearts you are with us. Even to the point of bloodshed. Then tell this to your friends. And I will tell it to Andrew Jackson as fast as I can reach the capital. I'll defend the rights of the sovereign state of Virginia with my life. But I will be the first to drag out and shoot .. Any blaggard who dares conspire to destroy the union through bloodshed. Now get out. Braxton, I'm driving at once to Washington. Yes, sir. [ Gunshot! ] Evening, Mr Dow. - Where is Mrs Eaton? She's in the dining room, sir. Senator Eaton has been detained at the State Department. Peggy. Rowdy, it is so good to see you. I'm in need of cheering up. It's been such a lonely day. What is it>? Something terrible has happened. John? John Randolph. What? I knew it. What happened? Well .. they say there isn't much hope. He has been shot, Peggy. Where is he? - At Warrenton. Will you come with me? Please, Rowdy. You know I will. Please wait. He may not want to see me. Braxton. Yes, Mr John? What did the doctor say today? The doctor says you are going to get well, sir. Braxton, you are the best friend .. And the worst liar that ever served me. Margaret? Yes, John. You couldn't keep me away, darling. Perhaps if I had not been a fool all these years. This wonderful moment. Might never have been quite the same. Quite so perfect. Darling. I have loved you always. Throughout a stupid life. And a wasted one. Now it is finished. But with a beautiful ending. The ending for which I have constantly prayed. You. With me. Smile for me. Now, please .. Go. How is he, Peg? Now don't be alarmed. Well, this is the most fortunate of all our meetings, Mrs Secretary Eaton. You will pardon my appearance but .. Two days in hiding haven't improved it such as it was. Get out of here. No need for heroics. Drive me into Washington and there I'll leave you. You will say nothing of having seen me. And naturally, I as a gentleman, will say nothing of having seen you. Get out! He'll start trouble for you, Peggy. He couldn't start it, Rowdy. And I don't seem to be able to put an end to it. Now, ladies. And the honorable gentlemen of my cabinet. In asking you all here together .. I figured we'd get to the bottom of this unpleasant business .. With the minimum of hemming and hawing and beating round the bush of prejudice. Mrs Beall. You have been on a soapbox all around the streets of Washington. Let's hear what you've got to say. Speaking for the women of this community. Speak for yourself, Mrs Beall. We are forced to take this stand for the salvation of the morals of our homes. I agree, madam. The morals of all your homes are badly in need of salvation. John. I'm sorry. Mr President, in addition to her questionable visit to Mr Randolph. Her participation in recent events have pronounced Mrs Eaton .. To be not only a local, but a national menace in our opinion. We realize that her sphere of influence is great. But we demand. That she be removed from that sphere and expelled from our community. Well, now .. If I ever heard a reasonable request .. Honestly put and .. oozing with justice. That was it. Are you the next on the program, Mr Secretary Ingham? Or are you just taking a walk? Mr President. I have been urged to express the feelings .. Of your cabinet members. With the one exception of course .. Of our unfortunate colleague .. Mr Secretary Eaton. There's nothing unfortunate about him. He is her husband. Whose presence here at this moment is as embarrassing to me as it must be to him. Any embarrassment I might be suffering is for you. Not because of you. Now John, you promised me .. Mr President. The unpleasant accusations against this woman. Are based on the sworn statements of some of our most respectable citizens. I demand proof of their accusations. And proof of their respectability. I suppose these here so-called respectable citizens .. Are ready to slap their claws on the holy book .. And swear they saw everything they say happened. I suppose you. And you. And you. Was there at the time. Hiding in a corner disguised as lampshades. By the Eternal .. There ain't one of you, man or woman enough, to bring your proofs forward. Proof based on the lies of accomplished slanderers like Mr Secretary Ingham .. Is far too crippled to come forward, Mr President. No amount of blustering can induce me to disavow .. What all the inhabitants of this city know. And what half the people of the United States believe to be true. I assume you stand ready to support that statement. You may assume nothing of the kind. I could hardly give satisfaction to someone I pity. Mr President. This is hardly a proper discussion. It's hardly a proper subject for discussion. I will remind you all that Peggy Eaton is my wife. I will regard any attack on her name as an attack on mine. And whether it's one of you or all of you. Now John, let me handle this my way. I apologise for the unseemly conduct .. Of a husband presuming to defend his wife's name. Have Mrs Eaton come in. Now get this. Every last one of you. And take it back home with you to your palaces of gossip and malice. Mrs Margaret Eaton. Travelled to Warrenton under my express orders. To visit the late John Randolph. God rest his loyal soul. And Mr Roderick Dow escorted her .. At the request of her own husband, Mr Secretary Eaton. The ease with which malicious slander is chucked about .. Makes what I'm about to say and do even more tragic. This same malicious slander, however .. Makes it inevitable. I address the gentlemen of the Cabinet of the United Sates. Uncle Andy, wait. I am beyond waiting, Peg. Over a period of months. You gentlemen have been a party .. To a relentless persecution of a defenceless woman. A treasonable persecution to my mind. Because the object of it was the wife of a fellow cabinet member. The wife of the Secretary of War of the United States. Gentlemen. Under the circumstances it will be impossible for me .. To place in you the trust and confidence .. I must place in the Cabinet of the United States. Mr President, I beseech you. According to the dictates of my conscience. And with the belief before God that what I am doing is just and right. I hereby. Ask of you. And accept your resignations. But .. But this is without precedent in the history of our country. Our country is without precedent, Mr Calhoun. The administration has been placed in jeopardy. Without justice, it can go to thunder. The whole danged country can boil up into a lather and bust wide open. But by the Eternal, I am going to have justice. Do you understand the word? 'Justice'. Now .. git. The whole lot of you. Go on. Get out of here. Do you reckon she is awful mad at me? She is prouder of you than ever before. The lie I told was shining truth next to the muck they threw at you and her. The anger I felt was love and charity .. Alongside the hatred and jealousy they felt towards you. It couldn't change, Peg. Only to grow. I had to cut it out like a rotten spot on an apple. What about the Union? What about the rest of the apple? Picking the cabinet won't be difficult. I have been thinking .. - What about the wives of the cabinet? Or do you intend to choose wives first and husbands second? Poor uncle Andy. Statesmen to the right and left of you crowding the halls of your senate. Willing and able. But no six wives to approve of Mrs Eaton. By the Eternal, I will have a bachelor cabinet. It isn't as simple as that. You see, uncle Andy. I have been thinking too. As hard as I could and every minute .. - Thinking about what? Frankly .. about me. Where I came from. Where I am going. What I wanted, and .. What I've got. I can remember another night when the rain beat against the window. With Bow. The way he laughed and understood. The way he died. Think, uncle Andy. I've been twice married. Once a widow. And once in love. Once in love. You speak in retrospect. You talk about your life as if it was over. Isn't it? What manner of nonsense have you got up your sleeve? What are you aiming to do? Git. Oh wait, Peg. I can't wait any longer, uncle Andy. You and your new administration can't either. What new administration? - The one you are about to form. The one that won't approve of me. There ain't going to be no such administration. Yes there will be. Let me quit while I'm ahead, uncle Andy. Let me git while the gitting is good. You know it's for the best for the peace and for the Union. It is funny. What finally takes you away from me. Is something that we both love with all our hearts. Where will you go? Are you sending Martin Van Buren as envoy to Spain or England? England. John H. Eaton. United States envoy to Spain. I think I would like that. Existing in Spain. Well, goodbye. Take care of Peg and don't get into any fights. Which do you want me to do? Well, take care of Peg and don't get licked. Well, I reckon there ain't anything else for us to say to each other. 'Isn't', uncle Andy. Well then. Isn't. By the Eternal .. ..s-d..
