The lady in the forest is the only one who can help me. Jacques is dead. He's not real, he's a ghost. I want to help him! Good morning everyone, thank you for attending this historic day. Today, we'd like to show you, what we do if, alas, one day, you happen to be on an operating table Lucas, it's time to wake up. Valérie Rossier's voicemail. Please leave a message. - Where's Lucas? - At home. No. I searched. Lucas! Alex, I'm going into the chasm. It's Lucas. He's fallen in. Lucas fell in there. I don't want you to go down. We can't wait any longer. We have to go. Be careful. I won't stay here hoping my son's still alive. It's up to you. Remember what I said? Yeah. Let's go. Here's the walkie-talkie. We'll stay in touch. Free. Lucas! Lucas! Lucas? We're coming, don't worry. Look. There. I'm going to hide, Valérie. Don't look, OK? Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Yves? Yves! Yves? Are you in there? Valérie! I want to go up. Help me go up. - I want to go out. Please. - Slowly... There, there. Breathe in this. It will all be OK. Calm down. Calm down. There. Slowly. There. It'll be OK. You think he's still alive? Lucas is resourceful. If you survived your fall, why not him? Come, let's go. We'll go together. Stay behind me. It will all be OK. We'll find him. Come. Hello? Hello? We've reached the bottom. The boy's not here. It's not clear. They're leaving the dome. They've not found him yet. Is he alive? It seems he headed to a gallery. How can it be! I can't say more for the moment. Secure yourself. Move on slowly. One step at a time. Lucas! And now, where do we go? Didn't you assert we had to take the left turn? That was just a child's story. We'll see. Come. Any news of the boy? They still haven't found him. - She went down, too. - To the witch's well? Oh, not again! Wait, wait. Do you know the legend? Back then, the source fed the whole area. Hence the name of the village: Villars la Source. The story goes that, about 200 years ago, the villagers threw the witch in the well, to set an example. She drowned. Three days later, the water was gone. The source had gone dry. That's how she took revenge. So, the legends goes that the day the witch returns, the source will gush once again. You believe that? That day has come. It was much dryer the last time I came. Lucas! There! He's there! Sweetheart! Is he breathing? It's very faint. His lips are blue. We must get him out right now. OK. I'll go alone. I'll be quicker. I'll come back for you. Be careful. All's well. The paramedics are there. They're attending to him. Think he'll get through? Your son's got a strong will. Don't worry. Come. Take this to Jacques, please. Lucas picked them for him. Valérie? Are you out of your mind? Off we go. Let's hurry. The shock must have been very severe. There are fissures in the cranium. There are loose fragments. There's a haematoma on the parietal lobe with a compression of the cranial ventricles. Valérie... This is serious. I can't predict the chances of recovery. We must first drain the haematoma. We'll perform the operation with the robot. I called on Dr Meyer. We're in no state to operate. No! I want to operate him. No! You're too close to the patient and you know about me. There are more competent doctors. But no one's more competent than you, if you would please assist me. As for me... I want to operate my son. Are you sure? I... I will assist you. Thank you. Thank you. You can set the pressure sensors. Add 20 milligrams of morphine. OK. Suture. Suturing. They've been there for 3 hours. I wanted to thank you for saving my son. I only did my job. I'm still grateful. The operation's over. We did what we could. Come on, my boy, it's up to you, now. Show us signs of brain activity. At least a little. It will do us good. Good job, doctor Rossier. Thank you. I'll take a room at the hotel. I don't intend leaving the clinic. Go to my place, if you wish. No. I don't like that house. If you lived in a more civilized and safer place... The grid was locked. Really? And the key was so well hidden that Lucas managed to find it? You should've never come here. How dare you say that! When you left us, what other choice did I have? I chose the wisest solution. "Wisest"? It's not about being wise. Think he'll pull through? I hope so. I can't even imagine what Valérie's going through. The neurological signs are weak. His condition has not changed. There's very little hope of him waking up. He could even stay many years in a coma. Unless there's a miracle. There are no miracles here. It's only science. Hi, Lucas. I prepared a place for you in my room. Wait and see. It'll be nice to be together. We'll have good fun. What did you say? He'll soon be with me. I won't be alone ever again. We'll be friends forever. Lucas is staying here. No. He'll soon be with me. Lucas! Help! Help! He's coming back. It's OK. Well done. I was wondering about building an extra wing. In my opinion, more patients will rush in, thanks to this robot. How is the boy? He won't go through the night. Even modern medicine is limited. Alas! Sometimes, your fatalism is very annoying, Bailly. It's OK. You can leave. Oxygen saturation is low. Our little man is tiring. The operation, the robot... all that would have been useless. You're wrong. If the operation hadn't reduced the intracranial pressure he'd already be dead. Going to wake up soon, big boy? You healed patients thanks to your gift. Do it for your son. I'd give my life to save him, but I am unable do it. I do have visions. I question patients, but I don't do anything. Come on, Valérie. Thanks to you, they discovered secrets about their past and that's how they were cured. I'm sure you can help him. Jacques? I know a man has hurt you. Your mother and yourself. What can I do to right what happened? Jacques? Jacques? Only I can take revenge. Only me and me alone. I need those plants. What for? They protect me from the doctor. I'll give them to you. But you must leave Lucas alone. I'm not responsible for his death. I just know it's going to happen. What can I do to stop it from happening? I don't know. But you can go and see my mother. Maybe she would know. Here. Promise me you won't go away. Wait for me, sweetheart. What are you doing? Where are you going? You can't go away! Iseult? Iseult! I've been waiting for you for so long. But now, it's for Lucas. Can you save my son? You're the only one who can do it. How? You already know how. I just have fragments of visions. And I don't even control them. That's all. That's only a part of what you're capable of. You have the power to heal your son. It's impossible. Then... you will fail. We're losing him. Where's Valérie? I'll try to find her. I'm sorry. - There's nothing we could do. - No! You must be brave. We'll let him go, slowly. That's the best for him. - Leave me alone with him. - Alright. Leave me alone with my son. Let's do what doctor Rossier's asking us. We'll leave her alone with him. Stop everything. I'd like you... to let me say goodbye to him. Let me say goodbye to him. Never forget who you are. You're a healer. Subtitles: ECLAIR
