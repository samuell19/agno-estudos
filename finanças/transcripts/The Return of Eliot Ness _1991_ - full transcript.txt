- Extra, extra, read all about it. Big Al dead in Florida. - Hey, let me see that. - Big Al dies in Florida. Extra, extra, read all about it. Big Al dead in Florida. - After what we went through to take down Capone, syphilis gets the bastard. If it wasn't so damn poetic, I'd puke. Hey, Harry, you lock up. Charlie, you go around back and get the car. All right boss. Hey, what's this? Hey, who are these guys? - Charlie, look out! - There's a shooter! - Hey. - Get down. Excuse me. - Labine, DA's office, special investigation. - Look at this, Labine. You're nothing but trouble. You come around asking questions. Next thing I know somebody's putting the heat on me. Who's got you in his pocket? That's what I wanna know. - You saying I'm on the take, Finn? - Well, let's put it this way. I hear you've been too close to the wrong people. - Looks like he's got your number. - Any guff from you, Moody, and I'll bust your face. Now, what happened here? - What's it look like, Labine. This city's up for grabs. All these guys used to be with Capone. Now out to take each other down and anybody else gets in their way. They hit Finn with a bazooka. - A bazooka did this? - Yeah, you ask me, they're after a cut of his gambling. - A bazooka that's it. Dammit, it ain't gambling. - What? What ain't gambling? - Move back please. - Lieutenant. Can I just ask you one question? - Yes, sir. - Helen Stokes. - Who may I say is calling? - Smith. Joe Smith. - Of course. - Helen? Helen? - "The Lord is my Shepherd. "I shall not want. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. "He leadeth me beside the still waters. "He restoreth my soul. "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness "for His name's sake. "Yea, though, I walk through "the valley of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil for art with me. "Thou preparest a table before me "in the presence of mine enemies "Thou anointest my head with oil. "My cup runneth over. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me "all the days of my life, "and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." We commend to you, O' Lord, the soul of Martin Labine. May he rest in peace, amen. I'm sorry about your father, son. - Thanks for the service, Reverend. - Gil? Eliot Ness. It's been a long time. I haven't seen you since you were a boy. - Yeah, it has been a long time. - Can you give me a ride back to the train? I let my cab go. - Okay, sure, come on. What are you doing now? - I'm with the police department. Just made detective. Dad used to tell me stories about you in the old days against Capone. Some pretty tall tales. - Most of them were probably true. - I used to be so proud of my dad, but he changed. - What are you talking about? That garbage in the newspapers? - That's part of it. The scuttlebutt at the police department is that he was bought off by the Malto gang to look the other way. When I asked him about it, he told me to mind my own business. - Your father would never take a bribe. - He ends up the head in bed with Bobby Malto's woman. What am I supposed to think? - Bobby Malto, that's Art Malto's kid? - Yeah, local hood, real scum. - You think he could've killed his girlfriend and your father? - I don't know, maybe. - What about the police? They have an investigation? - Yeah, they got a guy named Bert Moody on it. - I remember Moody. What's Art Malto doing these days? - I suppose he's trying to get his cut of the Capone empire like all the old guys. Now that Capone's dead, they're all fighting each other. We've got a gang war going on here. - What are they fighting over now? - Anything in small supply with big demand. Black market sugar, tires, prostis, gambling. - "Gambling?" Art Malto always had a cut of the gambling. I got to go back home, but you should keep the pressure on them. I wonder if Art Malto's involved? You can't trust Moody. He's as crooked as they come. You're a cop you owe it to your father. - I don't know him anything, not after all this. - Listen. Your father was one of my best treasury agents when we nailed Capone. There is no way he could ever go bad. - I appreciate the sentiment, but you're the only one who thinks that anymore. - No, a lot of people from those days hold him in great regard. - Yeah, so how come when I sent them all telegrams, you're the only one who showed up for his funeral? Train number 30, the Capital Limited, on track 27, Fort Wayne, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, - and Washington D. - C now boarding. I wanna see Art Malto. - Does he know you're coming? - No. Tell him it's Eliot Ness. - Look, buddy, if you doesn't know you're coming, you don't get by. - Who says? - I got orders now get out of here. - You tell them it's Eliot Ness. - What's going on? - He wants to see Mr. Malto. He says he's Eliot Ness. - Yeah, and I'm J. Edgar Hoover. Get lost! You get out of here! - Stay put. - What is this? You looking for trouble, huh? You look for trouble? Hey. - Let him go. Mr. Malto will see him. - I say who gets in who doesn't! - Mr. Malto will wanna see him. Mr. Malto says who gets in and who doesn't, understand? Come along with me. - What are you looking at? - Where have you been, Ness? I've been around. I see your boss did all right for himself. - Hey, how you doing, Ness? Go on, Tony. Ness isn't gonna try anything here. You remember Tony, Ness, huh? He served time for me once. - Yeah, I remember. - So, you're still working for the government, Ness? - No, you still working with the Capone gang? - Come on. Haven't you heard? Big Al is dead. - Good news travels fast. - Nah, I'm done with the rackets. I got more important things to do. Here. Look at this. Beautiful, huh? Huh? You got to take the time to smell the roses, Ness. - I think I'm smelling the roses right now. Those days are over. My booze is all legal now. - What about the gambling? - The only gambling I do is running ponies at Arlington park. I got a nice filly running in the feature tomorrow. She's a fast horse. You play the ponies? - Let's cut the crap. I wanna know about Marty Labine. - I don't know anything about Labine. - Don't give me that. He was killed with your son's filly. - I don't know anything about it. - I was at the funeral, Malto. I thought of you right off. Somebody sent roses. - Like I said before, those days are over. Anybody could have done it. Lots of people send roses to funerals. - I'm gonna make somebody pay for those roses. If it's you, I'm gonna take you down. This is personal with me. - Get your finger out of my face. Tony. Show Ness the door. - No, I hear you, Finn, now shut up! No, I'll let you know when he'll talk to you! Damn Mick. - Hey, Bobby, what the hell is going on? Did anybody from here send roses to Labine's funeral? - No. - Well, Eliot Ness thinks that I did. - So what? - "So what?" You know who Eliot Ness is? - Yeah sure, he's the guy that got Capone on taxes because he couldn't get him on nothing else. - He got Capone because he was as tough as Big Al was. Make no mistake about Ness, he's never been afraid of anything or anybody. Yeah. - All right, listen to this, Capone once sent a shooter named Fingers Lavetta against Ness. He got Lavetta's fingers back in the mail. That's who Eliot Ness is. Don't ever underestimate him, Bobby. - Don't underestimate me! I can take care of Ness if I have to. - Who put the hit on Labine do you know? - How the hell should I know? - Well, it should be important to you. Whoever hit Labine hit Helen. - Squeeze deserved it. She was ratting on me. - "She was ratting on you?" How could she do that? You told that broad our business? You told her what we do? - She knew nothing that could hurt us. - Bobby, we're in a war here. We got guys on our back. We got the cops breathing down our necks. Anything she knows hurts us. Let me tell you something. Remember, they're twists, you understand? Twists they're okay at night, but during the day, they're as dangerous as hell. Speak of the devil. How you doing doll? - You don't really think I'm a devil do you? I never doubted it for a minute. Hey, Bobby, why don't you take off, huh? Get yourself a nice, sweet twist, like Madeline here, hmm? That's a pretty outfit you got on there. Thank you. Mm, let me squeeze you. You feel good. - Son of a gun. I never thought I'd see your face in Chicago again. - Tough luck. Yeah. - Good to see you Joe. - You too. You hear about Labine? - Got anything on it? - It's pretty straight forward, mob style. Pretty much the same with a woman too. I've got her on ice. You wanna take a look? - Yeah. - Come on. - Nobody claimed the body? - How's that for respect. Maybe these women are a dime a dozen for hoods like Bobby Malto or maybe Malto is still upset she was sleeping with an ex G-man. - Who identified her? - Some friend of hers let me check the chart. Oh, yeah, Madeline Whitfield. She's a singer at the Red Rum Club. Quite a Looker herself, but a real iceberg. Never even shed a tear. - You've got an address for her? - Lakeshore Drive. - Classy. - More like well kept. - What happened you missed your train? - I thought I'd stick around a while. Get a few questions answered. May I come in? - You're wasting your time? - This your father's stuff? - Yeah, I had to clean out his place. I'm sorry to hear about your mother. Your dad wrote me about her. - You want any of this stuff, help yourself. None of it means anything to me anymore. - This is the hotel where your father was killed. Recognize the writing? - No. - Looks like a woman's writing. I'm gonna need your help. - To do what? - To get your father's killer. - He got himself killed. Okay, who sent the roses to the funeral? - "Roses?" I don't know I thought you did. - You thought wrong. Art Malto used to be known as Roses Malto because he sent roses to the funerals of his victims. That was his trademark. - What do you want from me? - It's not what I want. It's what I need. I have no authority here anymore. I need your badge. I trusted your father with my life. I want your help, but with or without you, I'm gonna get whoever killed him. He wasn't on the take, son. He was untouchable. Don't worry, hun, I'll be home before you know it. I love you too. Thanks. Were you working the night Ms. Stokes and Martin Labine were killed here? - Yes, sir, I called up to her for him. I didn't hear what happened till I came to work the next night. - Did she lived here? Yeah, full time. - Who paid for the room? - Bobby Malto kept it for her. Thank you. - Mr. Ness, I've thought about what you said last night, and I'd like to go along with you. I guess, I should give my dad the benefit of the doubt. - You guess you should? - Okay, I wanna give him that. - Good. You drive. Are you Assistant DA Pete Sheppard? - That's right. - Eliot Ness. This is Gil Labine. - How do you do? - Oh, yeah, your father worked with... Have a seat. have a seat. What can I help you with? - I understand Marty worked with you. Was he on a case when he died? - Well, if he was, he was keeping it to himself. - Would you mind if I took a look at his files? - No, I guess not. I can't let you take them, but you can look at them here. - Thanks. What are you looking for? What are you doing back in Chicago? - Mr. Ness, this is Sergeant Moody, a Detective with the Chicago Police Force. He's... - We've met. What can I do for you Sergeant? - Nah, I had to come over. The DA's got some paperwork for me. - I hear you're on the Labine case. - Yeah. Yeah, it's real simple Ness. Your buddy took sides in the gang war and got scraped off the bedsheets. Word is he was swimming in some pretty dirty water. - How long has it been since you've had a bath? - What is that some kind of crack? - Where'd you get your information? - I got connections, reliable sources. They said he was on the take. - You try to make a case against him? - I got the word out. I let the department know there's a guy over in the DA's office taking a ride. We got to cover our butts in the PD, but he's a DA's problem, right? - So you're the fat mouth behind all the talk? - Your old man was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong woman. - I'm gonna put that smile behind your ear. Hey, fellas, come on! - You wanna scrap you wanna try me come on! - Back off, Moody! - Me, he's doing all the shoving! - You shoved him with your mouth. Now, listen to me. I don't believe you for a second. You got any real evidence, or you're just blowing smoke? - I saw him myself trying to shake down Roger Finn at the Racing News the day it got hit. Finn told him to drop dead. - You're a liar! - All right! - This case is open and closed. - Not as long as I'm around. - You got no authority here anymore, Ness. Go home. Mind your business. - What happened with the News? - Somebody blasted it with a bazooka. - The mob's using bazookas now? - I called every day this week. Now put him on the phone, you punk. Dammit! Punk! Mr. Finn, there's two men here to see you. - Tell them I'm busy. One of them is a cop. The other one's Eliot Ness. - How the hell should I know who killed Labine? Don't you read the newspapers? Maybe someone was just knocking off two birds with one stone. - Whoever killed him had something to do with this attack on you. - Oh, yeah? What makes you think so? - He was here that night. Who's got it in for you, Finn? - I wouldn't tell you if I knew. These guys they come, they go. They'll get theirs. Forty years I've been dealing with them. I'm still here. I can take care of myself. - You go against the mob alone, you'll get fitted for a pine box. - I'm not alone. I have friends. I have protection. - You call this protection? The front of your building looks like Berlin. - It can be fixed, kid. - Times are changing in the mob. These guys wanna be businessmen. They want to expand, improve profit margins. A hood like Malto has to go after you. No way. - No. He looks at you and he sees a shot of getting a cut of gambling all over the country. - Man, you're so far off base. You ain't even in the ball park. Art and I go way back. I take care of him. He takes care of me. - I wasn't talking about Art. - Bobby? You think Bobby did this? Art runs that gang. What Art says goes. Bobby is a punk. - You really think Bobby Malto hit the News? - He could have. - How do you figure? - Your father was at the News the night it got hit. He had a file on Bobby Malto. He had copies of the Racing News at his place. He never played the ponies. He was onto something. We shadow him long enough, we might find where the bodies are buried. Come on, there's something wrong with this place. - What? - Excuse me, we just got in town. A buddy of mine said we could find some action here. Fourteen. Fourteen, come on. - You want something? - We're looking for Bobby Malto. Heard he runs this operation. - Look, if you're cops, you've been taken care of. - Is that right? What cop's been bought off? - Hold it! - Let's go. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Now, I want some information. Don't show your badge if you can't back it up. Here. - Keep it. I have another one in the car. How'd you spot this place for a gambling den? - They have a lot of customers, but nobody stayed for dinner. - We're gonna have to check every address on that list. - Yeah, but first I want to see a woman at the Red Rum Club. It sounds real good We'll discuss that at the office tomorrow. Right. ♪ Personally I want to ♪ ♪ And what did Romeo ♪ ♪ See in Juliet ♪ ♪ Or Piro ♪ ♪ In Pirouette ♪ - We'll sit at the bar. ♪ Or Jupiter in Juno ♪ ♪ You know ♪ ♪ And when Salome danced ♪ ♪ And had the boys entranced ♪ ♪ No doubt it must have been easy to see ♪ ♪ That she knew how to use her ♪ ♪ Personality ♪ ♪ Just tell me how you like my ♪ ♪ Personality ♪ - She's the woman who identified Helen Stokes' body. That's Bobby Malto right there. He could own this club too. - No, I suspect this belongs to Art. Back in a minute. Long time now see. Ms Whitfield? Yes? - I'd like to talk about Helen Stokes. - Who are you? - My name's Eliot Ness. - I can't help you. - Helen Stokes, Ms. Whitfield. Why were you the one who identified her body? - She was my friend. - Do you know who killed her? - No, now I have to go. - Do you know why she was killed? - She fell in with bad company. Now I must go. - It looks to me like you're running with the same company. - I told you, Mr. Ness, I can't help you. - You can't or you won't? - Both. - Good evening, Mr. Malto, nice to see you. Enjoy your evening. - Take a look. - I hear you've been asking around about me, Ness? - You got big ears, Art. - Who's the kid? - My name's Gil Labine. Martin Labine was my father. - Leave town, Ness. Live long. Be happy. Let's go home doll. - What makes a girl like that... - A woman like that knows exactly what she's doing. - You wanna tail them? - No, we'll stick with Bobby. - Yeah, thanks a lot. We had a nice time. - Good to see you. Hey, Frankie, you drive. - Take it easy. - Step on it. - Thanks a lot. - I wanna get there while I'm young, all right. All right, I'll drive. I'll let you drive later. - Art came in like he owned the place all right. How'd you know that was coming? - My wife has a garden. Red Rum is the name of a rose. - You still owe me back from last week. Do you remember? - What you were with me? - Oh, come on, get real. - Wait a minute, wait. What's he do? - Quit horsing around. Every time you guys come here... - I know this place. This is an old Capone speakeasy. We smashed this place one time. - Yeah, what's the word? - "Word?" What word? - They don't have the password. - Easy, easy! - Hey, what the hell are you doing man? - Chicago PD we're looking for Bobby Malto. Don't get in our way. How about another Scotch. This is what happens here. Come, on, come on, come on. We have two winners. - Excuse me. What do you want? - I wanna ask you a few questions about Helen Stokes. - Such as what? - Such as did you kill her? - What is this? You trying to shake me down here? - No, we wanna know who killed Helen Stokes? - What's it to you? - The name's Labine. - Stupid must run in your family. Don't you have any respect for the dead? - "Respect?" You left her on the slab in the morgue, Malto. You didn't even give her a decent burial. Respect? She was like human being, and you treated her like trash. She was trash. She couldn't keep her mouth shut. No, I did not kill her. I should've. Your old man couldn't leave her alone. She got what she deserved so did he. - Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy! - Let these officers leave peacefully. - We should've stood our ground! Taken them right there! - Calm down I got what I wanted. - What? - "She couldn't keep her mouth shut," that's what he said. - Yeah, what about it? - All I've been hearing around here is Marty Labine was bought off. He was with that mal because she hooked him, but he wasn't on the hook, kid. He was working Helen Stokes for information. The night your dad died, he was on an investigation. We find who he was after, we find the killer. - I want that cop taken care of, and I want that Ness dead. Everything is okay. How's your drink? - It's fine. Here's your change, sir. Thank you very much. - Night Clerk already off duty? - Yes, sir, he just left. - Do you keep registration cards after a guest has left the hotel? - Yes, sir, sometimes things are left behind. - I'd like to see the registration card for Ms. Helen Stokes. - I don't know if I can. It's hotel property. Well, okay, just for you, Mr. Ness. I think we still have it here. Here it is. - Thanks. - What's up? - Helen Stokes wrote that list of addresses. You take half the list. I'll get the rest. What'd you get? - Saw a pretty good movie. Bookie joints, card parlor, gambling what about you? - The same. - Do you think they control all these places? - They either do what or they want to. What do you got left? - Got a stables on my list out near Arlington Park. - Let's go. - Gentlemen, have a look here. Fine, fine looking individual in the ring here. How much money? Even a good $10,000. $5,000 you can buy two. Two, thank you, sir, now three. Did you say $3,000? Thank you, four. Sir, you're on at $4,000, three, $3,500 then.

All through, all done at 3700. - Madeline, this is Colonel Evans. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - And this has Major Ringsmuth. - Hello, I must say I love to meet war heroes. - I bet you do too. - I got to talk to you right now! I've been calling you! - What's the problem? - What do you think you're doing here? - Don't strong arm me, Bobby. - Oh, you want trouble? - Hey, hey, hey, knock it off! - Come on I'll give it to you! Come on! - Stop that! - Get out of my way. - Get lost! - Come on, what are you doing? Hey. What's the matter with you? We come here to have a good time. - All right. - Now what's the matter with you? You got something to say to me, you can come to my house. You don't make trouble in public. - I've been wanting to come to your house. I've been wanting to talk to you. He's been stopping me. - Damn Mick! - You shut up! Shut up! Sit down! Look at the horses, go on. Go on. Come on Finn, we can talk right now, come on. $5,000. Can I have $2,000? Who'll give $2,000? A $1,000, thank you, now two. A $1,000, 1500, then 15. - Roger, Roger. What's the matter, huh? This business is between us nobody else. - Every time I try to get to you, Bobby gets in the way. - Hey, he's my son. You know it is, he's young. Sometimes he steps out of bounds. He doesn't know about our deal. - Yeah, well I'm not getting protection. Are you gonna live up to our deal or not? - Hey, hey, wait a minute. Don't insult me. I always stick to my deals. That's how I do business. - They're hitting me with bazookas! - Who is? Who's pressuring you. - It could be any of the Capone guys. That's why I came to you when this war started. Now, you guaranteed you could protect me against the rest of them. - I'll take care of it, all right? I'll find out who it is and I'll stop it. Now, relax all right? Relax, take it easy. Pretty horse huh? There's nothing like it, Finn. - Nothing to like what? - The sport of kings, Finn. The sport of kings. Yeah. What a beauty. Good boy. $4200, 42, 45, 47, $5,000. Five, thank you, sir. - What are you doing here? - I thought you said you didn't have any problems with the Maltos? - I don't. - What would you call that little scuffle you just had with them? - I'd call it no big deal. I got it all straightened out with Art. What about Bobby? You're gonna buy him a new suit? - Buy him a new suit? That punk ought to buy me a new cigar. - Laugh yourself into a grave, Finn. I'm at the Warwick Arms Hotel. If you need me, give me a call. - I don't need you. - Urso said you wanted to see me? - Yeah. - What do you want? - You've been keeping Roger Finn from seeing me? - Finn guy's a pain in my neck. - He's under my protection. Anybody moves on him, moves on me. - Well, you're picking the wrong guy to protect. - I protect him, Bobby. The Racing News is our avenue to every track in the country. We're going nationwide. - Why didn't you tell me about this before? I thought you wanted me to run the gambling? - Yeah, well, you take the street stuff. Craps, numbers, the clubs, show me what you can do. Finn's the big picture. I'll take care of that. Sometimes in the war, it's better not to know all the moves. - Maybe I got something going that could win this war for us. - Yeah? - Yeah, maybe, I got something going that could take down all these guys. Maybe I got something going that can make us bigger than... - "Bigger than what? "Bigger than what?" - Bigger than Capone. - "Bigger than Capone?" You get something that could do that? What do you got going? What, Bobby? - Nothing. - "Nothing?" It better be nothing. Now you listen. You do what you're told, you hear? You let Finn see me anytime he wants to, and don't ever come between me and the business again, you understand? - I understand. - ""Bigger than Capone." - Anything for me? - Yes, sir, Mr. Ness. Keep it clear now. Just stand back please. - An M3 grease grease gun, a military submachine gun. - Hold it. Yeah, they're soldier's from the Malto gang all right. You really cut it this time, Ness. What the hell are you up to? You got no authority here. - He's with me. - Oh, good, get yourself a kid cop. You think you could ramrod this city? - They tried to kill him, Moody. - Shut up. You were lucky this time. Next time they'll come after you with everything they got. - Here don't hurt yourself. What's going on? - Hey fellas, hold up. This is a crime scene. - Bert, who got killed? - Looks like a couple of boys from Art Malto's gang. - It's a mob battle? - Wait a minute. Isn't that Eliot Ness? That was Ness. - I got to report to make with the Commander. Come on, get back. There's Ness don't let him get away. Ask Ness. - Excuse me. - Mr. Ness. - Mr. Ness. - Somebody ran a hit on Ness. - They get him? No. - Don't you know who you're messing with? You're gonna get killed trying to take Ness down. I told you don't mess with him. Leave him alone. He's too big for you, you little... - Pop... - Shut up! You shut up! You, you do nothing! You'll do what I tell you, nothing else! You're not ready to take over this organization. I'm not sure you're ever gonna be ready. Go on, get out of here. Get out of here! - I wasn't sure you'd come when I called. So you and Mr. Ness wanna know about Helen Stokes? Girls like Helen come from big families and small towns. They come to the big city to work in war plants, to be on their own and try to have some fun and make something of themselves. But wars end and they're out of work with nowhere to go. So men like Bobby Malto come along, and they see it as their big chance to be somebody. They just don't realize what they've gotten into until it's too late. Why don't you sit down? - Are we talking about Helen Stokes, or are we talking about you? - Let's just say we're not that different. - What do you want from me? - It's not what I want from you. It's what I can give you. Art Malto killed Helen, and he killed your father. - Why are you telling me this? - Because you're Martin Labine's son and because you're working with a one man who might be able to get Art Malto. I want him to pay for what he did to her. She was my friend. - Do you have any proof that he killed her? Do you have any proof that he killed my father? - No, I guess I don't, but he did it. - What makes you so sure? - He sent the roses, didn't he? - Don't worry, doll, I'll let myself in. - What the hell do you want? - What do I want? Who the hell do you think you are going to my old man? Didn't I tell you when you deal with the Malto gang, you deal with me! - I only deal with Art. - No, no, no, no! You don't go to him anymore. Me and him, we talked. My father, he gave you to me. - You're a punk, Bobby. I don't deal with punks. - Look! We know you've been spilling your guts on our gambling operations. - I haven't squealed on anybody! - You squealed to Labine! He knew too much about us. - Whatever Labine got, he got from that little bimbo of yours. If you weren't so smart Bobby, you'd be dangerous. - My father believes you ratted us out. I run gambling for the Malto family. You ever try to cross me again, you're dead. - Ingrid. Yes, boss? - Get me Eliot Ness. - Hey, gentlemen. What are these? - That's every Malto gambling operation in Chicago. We're gonna need your help. - Mine? With what? We're gonna need authority from this office. We're gonna need paddy wagons, and we're gonna have to have cops that we can trust assigned to this operation. - We're gonna raid the Maltos. - I'm not sure I can do this. - You worked with Marty Labine. Gut feeling, Sheppard, was he clean or was he dirty? - You with us or not? - This is a raid. Under the authority of the Cook County District Attorney Special Investigations Unit you're all under arrest. Nobody move, nobody move! - Keep you hands clear. - This is kind of fun. Evening gentlemen, this is a raid. Get your butts against the wall, move it! - Sorry to spoil the good time boys. Come on, let's go. - What gives? - Ness, what can you tell us? Is this a gambling bust? - Well, folks, tonight the lights went out on gambling in Chicago. - So there's progress, Ness. - Sheppard! Now, this is the man who deserves the credit for shutting down the Malto gang's gambling operations in Cook County. Well done, Sheppard. Tell us the steps that you took. Mr. Sheppard? - What can you tell us Mr. Sheppard? - Give us the details of the operation. Well, I wouldn't say that I was the... - Any messages, Nathan? - Yes, sir, Mr. Ness. - Thanks. - What is it? - Finn called. - Yeah, who is it? What? Is that you, Ness? - Finn! - Yeah, who is it? What do you want? This. Hell of a weapon. - Kind of hard to miss. - Did you take care of Finn? - Ness hit the gambling operations. Ness and that cop shut me down all over town. - Take it easy. - "Take it easy?" How can I take it easy? You want me to take it easy? - What about Finn? - "What about Finn?" Who the hell cares? All hell's breaking loose. Now the Capone guys wanna have a meet tomorrow 'cause of this Ness raid. - Which Capone guys? - The old guys like my old man. The heads of the gangs they're vultures! They're trying to cut us up. - Take it easy. Take it easy okay? Listen, with what we're getting, nobody will be able to hurt us. Nobody will be able to do anything except what we say, not even the law, believe me. Now, what about Finn? Did you take care of him like I said? - Yeah, he's gone. I got him. - Good. I'll take care of Ness. I know how to handle men. I've always known how to handle men. Hi. - Hi - Come on let's walk a while and pretend. - Pretend what? - Pretend it's just the two of us. - Raid you made last night really upset the big boys in the gangs. - Good. - They're having a meeting today with Art, all the Capone guys. - What for? - I don't know but I can try and find out if you want. - How are you gonna do that? - I have my ways. - What are we talking about here? What are your ways, and what are you gonna do, take the old boy to bed? - Yeah, if I have to. I'll do whatever it takes. I'll get him to tell me whatever you want. Maybe I'll even get him to tell me why he killed your father. - These guys are the big leagues. They find out you informed on them, nobody's gonna able to stop them from coming after you. - I can take care of myself. I've been playing in the big leagues for a long time. - It's too dangerous. - It doesn't matter. Do you want me to help you or not? - Yeah. - Yeah, what? - Yes, I want you to help me. - I thought you'd never ask. - Why are you doing this? - I told you, Helen Stokes. - No, no, besides Helen Stokes. I mean, why are you really doing this? - Because I want my life back the way it was before. This is my last chance to get away from this life. - You're shivering. - I'll be okay. - Three. - Watch your step. - There's gonna be a meeting this afternoon at the Malto estate. All the Capone mob chiefs are gonna be there. - Where'd you go to the information? - Madeline Whitfield. - What makes you think we can trust her? - She wants to get the Maltos as much as we do. She is sure that Art killed my father and Helen Stokes. - She's a gangster's mal. - She's trapped. She wants to help. - She could be dangerous. - I'll risk it. - I think we should stake out the meeting and see if she's on the level. - Okay. - Good. Pick you up this afternoon. - Mr. Ness, I've been expecting you. - You're expecting me? - Of course, Gil told you about the meeting today didn't he? - Yes. What game you're playing? - What makes you think I'm playing a game? - Every time I turn around, I seem to be bumping into you. - I'm an easy woman to bump into. - Let me tell you something. Easy lines from easy women don't work with me. - You don't think much of me do you? - You're Art Malto's mal. Gil may think you're on the up and up. But you don't. - I've been around too long. - That's exactly what I was counting on. You see, I called Gil because he's with you. You're the only man who can get Art Malto for me, and you're the only man who can make him pay for killing Helen and your friend. - Art Malto didn't kill Marty Labine. - Of course he did. What makes you think he didn't? - Like I said, I've been around too long. Then who did? - I don't know. Somebody close to him. - Bobby? - Maybe. - Helen was his woman. - Or maybe it was you. - Me? No, Helen was my best friend. - So how'd she like it when Bobby started calling on you? - Bobby and me? Are you crazy? Art would kill me. - Not if you get him first. Ms. Whitfield. - Mr. Ness. - Granted since big Al passed, we had some troubles, but it was all among us. Now, I say we make peace with each other. - You mean no more war? - No more war. The North side gang stops shooting up the South Side boys Nobody hits the two league gang anymore. - What about the shipping? The hookers? - We split it up fair and square. Big Al brought us together. He left enough for everybody. We quit these murders among us, we all make money. - So who takes care of the police, and the judges, and the alderman? - We share the expense. We share the benefits. My accountant calls it what? Amortization. - Okay, peace, I'm all for peace. I'm for everybody getting their piece. But we got a problem we've got to take care of first. We got Eliot Ness back in town. - He's Art's problem. Art's the one he's after. - The way I see it a hit against any of us is a hit against all of us. - The way I see it he hits one of us, he's going to get around to hitting us all. - So this is the business Art's got to take care of before we have any peace. - The problem is somebody hit Martin Labine, and Ness won't let it rest. I wanna know who made that hit because I didn't. - None of us had reason. It was your boy's broad that was with him. How did that happen? You find out who ordered the hit. - I'll do it, but I have a condition. Whoever's putting the heat on Roger Finn has to stop. Finn's under my protection. Anybody goes against him, goes against me. - What's going on? You slipping, Art? They scraped Finn off the floor at the Racing News last night. - I wanna know what's going on around here, and I wanna know right now. - I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't know what I'm talking about? I gave you the gambling to run, and now it's in the sewer! - I'm gonna take care of that. - No, you're not! I just had a meeting with the heads of the other families. They say we can have peace among the gangs if we quit stirring things up. I didn't know we were stirring up anything! I didn't even know Roger Finn was killed last night! - What are you gonna do? You're gonna roll over and do what they say? - I'm gonna make the peace! - What happened to you? You used to be one of Capone's top lieutenants. You used to be so tough, you used to brag about killing by sending roses to the funeral. Now you're like some old lady smelling the roses. We go to war with these guys, we can take them. They're old men. - They're living on the old days. We can take it all. Be bigger than Capone. - No, I want no war. I want no war! But I wanna know who killed Finn. You have anything to do with it? - To hell with Finn! You should be happy he's off your back! - Tony. Check it out. Find out what's going down and who's behind it, okay? - Okay boss, I'll take care of it. - Thank you, Mary. - The old man's gonna screw up everything. - Hey, hey, take it easy. Slow down and take it easy. - Quit that take it easy talk. - Listen to me. Now, it won't be long. We're gonna take it all, but if you lose control, we could lose it all. - Madeline, come here. - I don't want you to go with him. - Don't be a fool. What happened between you and Bobby? - He wants to start a war. He wants to take on Ness and the whole Capone gang all at the same time. He don't understand. We don't need that anymore. I'm tired of wars. Everybody, the whole country's tired of wars. I mean, we don't need everything. We got more than enough now. - Is that all? - You know, sometimes, sometimes, doll, you're really something you know that? - I try to be. Don't mind Bobby. He's just a hotheaded boy. - Well, he's my son. He knows when he's ready, I'll give him everything. He knows that. - Well, maybe he thinks he's ready now. - Yeah, but he's not. I'm not sure he ever will be. He's got to quit being a hothead. - I think it runs in the family. - Yeah? - Maybe that's what I like about you. - I never doubted it for a minute. - I could get inside. See what he's doing. - No, we'll wait. - He'll never even know I was there. - Wait. - Well, that's a pay off for something. - Hi. - I need your help. It's about time you woke up, sleepy head. I've got something special for you. - You do? - Mm-hmm. You'll like it. - I will? - Definitely. - What is it? - Breakfast. Come on, get up and get dressed. How do you like your coffee? - Hot. It looks good. - You working with Ness today? - Yep. - You think you can get Art? - Oh, we can, and we will. What? - You're not like all the other guys. - Chicago PD, we need to see the commanding officer. - Please wait here. Mr. Ness, I'm Major Ringsmuth. How can I help you? - This is Gil Labine, Chicago Police Department. - Major. - We need to ask a few questions. - Okay. - Are you acquainted with Bobby Malto? - No, I can't say that I am. - Really? - We've heard that he's doing business with this facility. - Well, your information is incorrect. I run the entire operation here and I never met the man. You store arms here? - Yes, we store arms, but this facility is just a storage depot for military weapons before they're dismantled and melted down. - I see. You keep any anti-tank weapons, like maybe bazookas here? - Well, now, I can't say Mr. Ness. You're asking questions about official military business. - Do you mind if we go in and take a look around? - Yes, I do. This facility is not open to the public. I can't authorize that without a warrant. - Do you scrap weapons here? - No, sir, we send them over to the Illinois Ironworks. - "The Illinois Ironworks?" Yes sir. - Thank you, Major. Thank you very much. - Pleasure to meet you sir. - Major. "Illinois Ironworks?" - Yeah. What do you know. This is where the pay off was. - We'd like to take a look around. Who's the foreman? - Right over there. See where the window is? Second floor. - Hi, how's it going? I'm Eliot Ness. This is Gil Labine, Chicago Police Department. Are you the foreman here? - Yeah, what's up. - We see you're scrapping surplus army weapons. We'd like to ask you some questions about the company. - Okay, shoot. - Does Bobby Malto own this company? - I never heard of the guy. He was seen here last night. - Yeah, who saw him? - We did. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Malto had keys to the front door. - Look, I said I don't know the guy! Now take a hike! - You're gonna get a broken arm unless we get a few answers! - Look, we know this isn't your trouble. If we get these people, we'll take you down with them if you don't help us out. You tell us what we wanna know, keep your mouth shut about it, we'll forget you were here. You know what I'm saying? Who owns the place? - I don't know, but it ain't no Bobby Malto. - Who signed the papers? - Some dame name of Madeline Whitfield. She signs the checks. - When is her next arms shipment coming in? - Tonight. - Thank you. Madeline? I'm in here. - Tell me everything you know about the Illinois Ironworks. - I've never heard of it. What is it? - It's a foundry where they scrap surplus military weapons. - Why would I know anything about that? - You own it. - What? - Your name's on the papers? - Well, maybe Art put my name on it. He has me sign all sorts of papers. - Why would he do that? - So no one would know that he owns it. He'd do it to cover himself. - Don't lie to me! - I'm not lying! Don't ever do that again. - You signed the paychecks. You've got to know something. - I told you I don't know what you're talking about. - You're lying to me. You signed the checks. You know what's going on. You're guilty as hell. - You're just like your father. He couldn't keep his nose out of my business either. - Excuse us. - Excuse me. - What do you expect, Ness? The kid stuck his nose into something that was none of his business. He got hurt. - "None of his business?" He was looking for his father's killer. - So what do you want from me? I got nothing to do with any of this. - Martin Labine is dead. His son's in the hospital. None of this would've happened if you weren't stealing surplus army weapons! - "Stealing surplus army weapons?" That's hijacking. I ain't done any of that punk street stuff in years. I got too much class now. - You think you got class? You think a big house, and a tailor made suit, a diamond stick pin buys an old hoodlum class? You're in the same gutter you've always been in. You're Roses Malto you'll never change. - I told you to quit with the Roses. I ain't the guy I was with Capone. I mean, the rackets are the old days. Booze, gambling, the tracks, they're legal now. They're legitimate business. I'm a legitimate businessman. - You're a hood, and I know how you hoods work. You use a woman's name to cover your butt. You got Madeline Whitfield as owner of the ironworks. She's fronting for you. - Madeline you don't know what you're talking about. Get out of my house. - Take a look at this. - Yeah, so what? - I found this next to Gil Labine's bed after he was shot. - I told you to get out of my house! - Ness, let's go Ness. - This business killed my best friend and almost killed his son. I've got a job to do, Roses. I'm gonna finish it. - All right, this is the biggest shipment yet, so let's get it the hell out of here in a hurry. - Relax, this is Detective Bert Moody with the Chicago PD. Didn't I say I had it all covered? Let's take a look at the goods. - What do you know? You better put this on. - What's this for? - It's to keep the bullets from going through. - And the government just wants to throw it all away. Okay, unload the trucks onto the box car. - Let's go. - With this kind of firepower, nobody can come close to us. What the? - What, what, what's going on? Dammit Bobby, what is this? - Take it easy. - It's Ness! - Put the gun down, Malto. - Back off, Ness. - Put the gun down! - Well, that's it Bobby, we've had it. - Shut up! - Give it up, Malto. Take him! - That's the ammunition truck! - Don't try it, Malto. Get up easy. Nice and easy. - I had no choice. ♪ Now the rains are falling ♪ ♪ Hear the train calling, ooh ♪ ♪ My momma done told me ♪ ♪ Hear the lonesome whistle ♪ ♪ Blowing across the trestle, ooh ♪ ♪ My momma done told me ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Clickety clacks are echoing back the blues ♪ ♪ In the moonlight ♪ ♪ The evening breeze will stop ♪ ♪ The trees from crying ♪ ♪ And the moon will hide its light ♪ ♪ When you get the blues ♪ ♪ In the night ♪ - We had to let Malto go. He had no part in the shooting. We couldn't hold him. Speak of the devil. - I suppose you mean me? - Nobody else left doll. - Where's Bobby? - Bobby's dead. - How did it happen? - Hijacking surplus army weapons at the armory in the rail yard. - I'm sorry. - For what? - For you, he was your son. - Yeah. Yeah, he was my son. You should have left him alone. - What do you mean? - You don't think I know? - I couldn't stop him, Art. He had big plans. He wanted to take over the whole town. - This weapons deal was Bobby's idea? - Yes. - Hitting Finn was his idea? - He wanted to show you he could take over the gambling. - Killing Labine and Helen was his idea? His own girlfriend? - She was spilling her guts to Labine, telling him everything. - Going to bed with you? Turning against me with his idea? - Yes. - No. No. He wasn't smart enough to come up with all these ideas. He didn't have big plans. You did. He couldn't kill Helen, but you could. He wouldn't have turned against me. I'd have given him everything, but you pushed him. You used him. He was my son. You got him killed, you slut! - Yeah, I killed Helen. She couldn't stand it when Bobby went with me. Yeah, I turned him against you. Why not? I was nothing more to you than just a twist. Every time you touched me, you made my skin crawl. You meant nothing to me. - I got here first doll. - Art, no. Hold it right there, Roses. - We've been at it a lot of years, Ness. You're still a son of a bitch. So when are you going back to Ohio? - The afternoon train. I have something for you. It was in his files from the start. Your father had it all. That's why he was killed. He was a good man. - Good day, gentlemen. Pete. - I thought this might brighten up your room. - You know, come to think of it, I don't know why she sent roses to my dad's funeral. - Maybe she wanted to make it look like Art was guilty. It worked. - She sent roses too. - What do you mean "too?" Well, I sent roses to the funeral. I mean, your father worked for us and nobody cared. I mean, it was the least I could do. - Extra, extra, read all about it! Crime fighter Ness busts Malto gang! Read all about it! Eliot Ness clears Labine name! Extra, extra, read all about it!
