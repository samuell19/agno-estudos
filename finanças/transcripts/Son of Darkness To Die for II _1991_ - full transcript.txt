Dr. Roberts, please report to OB. [ breathing shakily ] - [ music playing ] - [ pinball flippers clicking ] - [ machine chiming ] - [ chatter ] Hi. Listen, you fat fuck, get out of my face. Excuse me. Buy you a drink? You got a fake ID or are you Peter Pan? Heh. I'm Danny. I'm Celia. - Hi. - Hi. So, are you up here for a weekend with your buddies, Danny? All by myself. Really? It's so hot in here, I can't breathe. How'd you like to take a walk with me, Danny? You're staring. Uh-uh. I'm sorry. It's just you're... I'm what? I'm beautiful? Intriguing? Can't put your finger on it, can you, Danny? You're cute. Not cute, Danny. I'm never cute. Come on, I'll race ya. Whoa. What? Ready, go! Wait, wait! Celia? Where'd you go? Celia? Shit! It's just me. I about had a heart attack. You're not angry with me, are you, Danny? Where'd you go? It's magic. Maybe I'll show you sometime. Ah! Hey. Easy. Come on, let's go. - Where? - Just come on. Heh. [ music playing in bar ] Go home. Come with me. My truck's right here. Whoa. - Boo! - [ gasps ] - You're a riot. - I think so. You hungry? Shut up. You know, you should've taken him, baby. That kid was putty in your hands. Not that I wasn't touched. I was. He liked me, all right? So do I, Cici. You don't have to be lonely. You can be with me. - Max wouldn't like that. - Oh, come on. Max can hardly stand the sight of you. But me, on the other hand, I love every inch of you. Leave me alone. You know I'm telling you the truth. Max can't stand you. [ radio chatter ] Yeah, we're gonna do an IVP tomorrow at 7:00. All right? Yeah, I'll see ya. Okay, bye. [ sighs ] What the hell's the matter with you? You should've come in hours ago. Come on. I just don't understand you. Why can't you for once in your life be on time? We've done this a hundred times before. Don't be angry at me, Max. I'm not angry at you. You're just late. - Here. - Is that all you got? I can't stand it cold. You know I can't. Well, just in case you haven't noticed, princess, this isn't a restaurant. I can't very well pop it in the microwave for you, now can I? Go on. Think of all the starving children. - [ TV playing ] - Woman: No, you don't. No, you don't. I was home at 7:30, thank you very much. - Man: Oh. - Woman: Yeah. Hey, Danny, I want you to call me at work today if Tyler gets any worse, okay? You know you say that every day? Yes. I'm worried. Look, the doctor said everything's fine. No, that's not what he said, Danny. He said the test came back-- All right, all right. You know, the Potters are checking out today. No. They said, um, Wednesday. Well, it's nothing against us, Nina. It's getting too cold. Summer's over, that's all. Is anybody else coming? No. [ baby crying ] Hey, hey, hey. Shh. Hey, hey. He's definitely not a morning person. [ sighs ] Oh... Nina? Hey, Nina. Hey, come on. What's the matter? - I can't stand it anymore. - What? I need a white knight. You know what I'm saying,Danny? I mean, some mornings I wake up and I think, "How did this happen?" Tyler's always sick. I've got no money, no husband, enough blind dates from hell to set a record. Heh. It just gets to me. Hey, you have me. Yeah, but you can't stay here all winter. You gotta get back to school. Eh, what for? I like it here. I don't want to go anywhere. - You don't? - No! Hey, I'm your brother. You need me, I'm here. - You're the best. - I love you. - Ahh. - I gotta get to work. - Okay. - You watch Tyler, okay? - You going out tonight? - Nope. Another unsuitable suitor bites the dust. Couldn't stand kissing him good night. Hah. See ya. Where was I? Woman on TV: It was here, high in the forests above Lake Serenity, where a teenage boy was killed last night in what appears to be a coyote attack. It has sent yet another shockwave through this sleepy mountain resort, where earlier this month a woman was killed in a similar attack. Authorities are looking for a possible witness to the attack-- the owner of an antique necklace found at the scene. The necklace has an ornate pendant set with a large garnet. Police are asking anyone with information about the necklace or the owner to please come forward. That's our live report. Back to you in the studio. Jane? Look, Bill, I need a little time off from the bank. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You've been great. And if you could just stay great for another 30 seconds-- Okay, yeah, yeah. I've been a little distracted. No, two of my friends were murdered last year and I lost Kate. I mean, they won't let me see her or talk to her. No, I can't let it go. Look, I need the time off. What's it going to take? No, no. No, you listen, Bill! There's a million goddamn banks out there. You want to fire me? You want to fire me, Bill? Fine! It's-- what? Another call? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll stay in touch. [ Tyler crying ] [ phone ringing ] [ Tyler crying ] Okay, who's next? Thank you. Nina Black? Yes. Hello. I'm Dr. Schreck. Hello. This is my son, Tyler. Hello, Tyler. Would you come with me, please? Please, come in. Let's take it easy, okay? What seems to be the problem? I don't know. Nobody seems to. He just cries all the time. I took him to the hospital for some tests, and they couldn't find anything. I need a closer look. Uh, I have to check a few things. Could you please wait here? Yeah. Woman over PA: Orderly to room 429. Orderly to room 429. Here we are. There we go. Tyler, hi. [ giggling ] What did you do? I gave him something to boost his red cell count. Do you know what's wrong with him? No. You're Tyler's natural mother, Mrs. Black? Nina. No, he's adopted. Hmm. What do you know about his parents? Nothing. It was set up that way. And his father left a few months after we got Tyler. He couldn't handle it. The fantasy's a long shot from the reality, you know. Boyfriend? No. Oh, excuse me. I'm with a patient, if you don't mind. I don't mind. Well, that's a cute kid. Is it a boy? Yeah. Look, excuse me. This is Tom. He's an old friend. Actually, I'm his brother. But you'd have to skin him alive to get him to admit it. Who are you? There isn't much I can tell you, I'm afraid, uh, now, but I'm sure everything's going to be just fine. - Nina: That's it? - Yes. Please see the nurse at the front desk about the paperwork. [ rock music playing in bar ] I'll have a beer. Jane? [ wind howling ] [ Tyler crying ] - [ shutters banging ] - [ crying continues ] [ door opens ] Hang on, sweetheart. It's okay. It's just the wind. Okay, Tyler. Shh, shh. - It's just the wind. - [ doorbell rings ] It's going to be all right. - [ crying continues ] - Shh. It's just the wind, sweetheart. [ doorbell rings ] Just a minute. That's my boy. Yeah, that's my boy. Yeah, it's okay. Oh, yeah, that's it. That's it. - [ gasps ] - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. I've been ringing the doorbell for hours. The door was ajar and I heard Tyler screaming. I thought something was wrong. I was worried. [ sighs ] - We're fine. - Good. Please, come in. Thank you. Please, have a seat. Come on, then, big boy. Let's have a look at you. [ babbling ] - Yes, I know. I know. - [ crying ] Aw, shh. You know, it's been so frustrating. One doctor says he's going to grow out of it, and then another one says he needs more tests. You're the only one that seems to know what to do for him. Here you go. Here you go.Yeah. How does he look? He looks sleepy. Come on. - Yeah. - There we go. He's going to be fine tonight. I just wanted to make sure. I wish I could tell you more. Well, I really appreciate this, Doctor. It means a lot. I was feeling like no one cared. Please, call me Max. Celia: The flirt. I'll kill him. [ Tom chuckles ] You don't fuckin' get it, huh? You're old hat. Salvation Army material. Don't be an ass! He brought me in. He seduced me. He's brought in a thousand women. The only reason he keeps you around is to clean up the house. You're wrong. He adores me. Sure, baby, tell me more. He's been getting by on plasma. That's what his problem is. He hasn't made a kill in months. You don't fuckin' get it,do you? I'm his own brother. And he brought me in. Then he packed me off to the west side. I was cramping his style. - Really? - Yeah, really! If you're his brother, where's your accent? I gave it up! This is my territory,baby. Movie stars, car phones, the land of opportunity. That snake had no business coming over here. So the Eastern Bloc countries are a little depressed. You think I give a shit? No. Let me tell you something, cupcake. This is my place. You're either with me or against me. And don't think Maxie Baby is going to help you. Because he's not. He's got a new girl now. Okay. I'm with you. That a girl. Besides, old shithead's become quite a stiff. Hey. Do you know what I always like to say? It's fun to have fun. But you got to know how. [ chuckles ] [ woman chuckles ] Oh, Jerry. Thanks, honey. [ moaning ] [ gasps ] - [ neck snaps ] - [ grunts ] [ chuckles ] [ choking ] Oh, you're such a hot, hot mama, baby. [ grunts ] I have children. Oh. I'll kiss 'em goodnight for you. Hehe. - [ grunts ] - [ neck snaps ] [ police radio chatter ] What happened? Another coyote attack. - Excuse me. - What? - Whoa, whoa. - Wait. Who's in charge? Is there a detective here? You have to let me through. I have some information. Okay, stick with me. As I can figure it, the glass breaks here, falls this way. I don't know how they got in, but whatever they did-- a number on their neck. He's got blood, just contusions everywhere. Figuring at some point, they had to come in-- - I got a guy out here that says-- - Just a minute. Came from that way. Front door. I don't know how else they could've gotten in. Everything else is locked up tight. - [ continues indistinctly ] - [ camera shutter clicking ] Ah, Jesus. Couldn't have been a coyote. Must be a wolf. Well, if it was, how did he get in? It wasn't any wolf. How do you know? Are you in charge? That's right. Look, I've-- I've seen this before. The way they kill, the way they-- hey, wait a minute. You think I'm kiddin'? Listen to me. I didn't see the victims, all right. But they had claw marks across their neck, didn't they? And bites all over like a dog had ripped chunks out of 'em, right? Am I right, huh? Cuff him. What? Are you guys serious? You have the right to remain silent. I don't want to remain silent. I know what's going on. You got to listen to me. You don't want to do this. Listen to me! Tell it to me down at the station. [ chainsaw buzzing ] Danny! Danny! What are you doing? Oh, this is my new plan. See, I figure we'll be vacant till ski season starts and money's going to be a little tight. These wood things sell for a mint. That's a great bear. No, it's a cow. Oh. My brother the artist. Look, my lunch break's over. I've got to get back to the marina. Yeah. No, not a problem. I got the baby monitor right here. Okay, but don't leave him alone too long, all right? - I won't. Bye. - Bye. Oh, wait! Wait! I forgot. I found this on the mat for you this morning. - Oh, thanks. - See ya. [ chainsaw buzzing ] [ engine starts ] Wow. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? [ growling ] Go on, boy. Get outside. Good evening. Hello. I'm glad you came. - May I take your coat? - Yes. Thank you. It's a lovely room. Thank you. Please. Look, since it's just the two of us, I thought we'd be informal and eat in here. It's much cozier. It's lovely. - Here we are. - Oh, thank you. Red wine's all right,I hope. Yes. Have you lived here long? About a year.Why? Well, I thought you could use a couch. Heh. - Or two. - [ both laugh ] You know, you're right. I'm not going to say another word. [ chuckling ] Not until you do. Okay. Okay, the real story. - The real story? - Mm-hmm. I used to be quite a collector. - Mm-hmm. - Some art and some furniture. - Furniture? - Good furniture. - No. No. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And then one day, I decided that I didn't want things anymore. Do you think that's strange? Well, actually, no. I think it's kind of refreshing. Good, 'cause that's exactly what I thought. You know, just leave it all behind. - Leave it all behind? - Mm-hmm. - Where? - Different places. Romania mostly. Romania? Really? Is that home? Home? What's that? I didn't know it was a difficult question. Well, now you know. [ chuckles ] So why did you leave this Romania? Well, at that time, most of my family had left. And I'd always had this fascination with the Americas. So what, you just pack up and leave? Well, in a manner of speaking. But you see, wherever there are people, there need to be doctors. True. So, did you find what you were looking for? Oh, yes, I think so. Why don't you eat something? You're making me feel like a pig. Look, you don't have to worry about me, Nina. I'm not going anywhere. You mean like my husband? Max, you hardly know me. I don't know about you, but I do know you. You just haven't found what you need. - That's not true-- - It's absolutely true. What are you saying? Never settle. I've got a surprise for you, a little treat I planned. Come on. So, you're a romantic. [ thunder crashing ] [ horse whinnying ] - [ thunder booms ] - [ horse neighs ] - What's the matter with him? - Nothing. [ whinnies ] Hold on! Jack, steady boy. Hold on to me! Whoa, Jack. - Easy! - [ neighs ] Hold on! [ neighing ] Easy! Hold on, Nina! Hold on! - Nina! Nina! - [ screams ] Are you all right? Wait, let's have a look. I'm sorry about the horse. - I-- - It's okay, it's okay. [ thunder crashing ] What are you doing out there? You're an ice cube. I wanted to see you. Wait a minute. Come here, Danny. How did you get up here? Or, for that matter, how did you find me? I have a lot of tricks you should know about. Wait, no, don't. I'll only have to take it off. You want to kiss me, Danny? Uh-huh. So come here, then. I've been thinking about you. Anything like the dreams I've had about you? [ chuckles ] [ thunder crashes ] Oh, you are an odd duck, Planting, and I can't figure you out. I already told you who the killer is. But you can't take me to him. I don't know where he is yet. Who are you kidding, Planting? There's no Vlad Tepish up here. You show me a drawing of some joker in a book and you say he's 500 years old, and you say, "That's him." You know something? You're making my mad wolf theory sound very reasonable. Look, what happened in LA last year is happening up here. The case is closed. The killer is dead. There was an accident in the lab when they were analyzing his remains. The technician cut her hand and some drops of blood mixed in. The next thing she knew, the place exploded. Jesus, Planting. After the explosion, the canister with the remains in it was completely empty. Now, remains don't just disappear, do they? I mean, even after an explosion, you'd have something left behind, some trace, something! You know, I left the city to get away from nuts like you. You know, I don't know what you want. I told you about the necklace. I described it to you. Well, maybe you read about it in the papers. Maybe you heard it on the news. Now look, you want to come up with some hard evidence, I'll talk to you. But don't go psycho on me. I don't want some one-man hit team running around in my mountains. Do I make myself clear? Yeah. I think I got the gist of it. Now, come on. Somebody wants to talk to you. What? Well, hi, doll face. Rough day, hmm? This is unbelievable. What else? Oh, come on. How about a little nightcap? No, Jane. No way. You know, sometimes, Martin, you're just adorable. Yeah, and you're dead. - Hmm. - Well? Well, I'm not arguing. I mean, worse things could happen to a girl. Never get a day older. Never gain another pound. Come on, honey, let's get a drink, huh? [ ballad playing ] Is Celia here, too? Mm-hmm. We're like birds, doll. We travel in flocks. Well, you're a very good-looking bird, Jane. Well, you've got that right, Marty. What are you doing here? I'm looking for him. What name is he using this time? No, Martin, you really don't want to do that. He's gonna pay. It's too late, sweetie. You know what you're going to do? When you get up in the morning, you're gonna get in your car and go home. I can't. Marty, please! Come on, Jane. Just help me. Look, I've got a great body, doll. I would like to keep my limbs attached. Martin... Oh, my. My, oh, my. What have we here? Mm-mm. Come on, Jane. Show me where he lives. We can do it together. I've got a big fishto fry. Jane, where are you going? Go see Nina at the Sky Forest B&B. She needs you. Who? [ vacuum humming ] [ doorbell rings ] - [ vacuum continues ] - Yeah? Uh, I'm looking for Nina. Nina! - [ vacuum stops ] - Yeah? There's some guy here to see you. Honestly, Danny, snap out of it. You're sleeping the whole day away. Yeah? Hi, my name is Martin Planting. Look, no thanks. We don't want any. No, no, no, no. I'm not selling anything. I-- That looks like a Bible to me. Does this guy's face look familiar? What if it does? Look, can I talk to you for a minute? Please, it's very important. Okay. Come on. Just let me open up this place a bit. Hey, Danny, could you take Tyler up so I don't wake him? Hey, careful. Danny, you feel all right? I'm fine. [ sighs ] My bad boys. Sleep all day, up all night. Yeah. Have a seat. Well? Well, I don't-- I don't know exactly how to say this, but the man in the drawing is not who you think he is. Then who is he? Well, what do you know about him? I know he's a wonderful doctor. He helped my baby. Oh, he's a doctor? Yeah, Dr. Schreck in the emergency room. The nightshift. Look, look, Nina, you don't know me from Adam, but this guy is very dangerous. His name isn't Schreck. It's Tepish, Vlad Tepish. - Does that mean anything to you? - Nothing. Look, I know this is going to sound really crazy, but he's the guy Dracula was based on. - [ laughing ] - Look, I know. But it's all in this book about what he did to people-- the vampirism, the terrible-- You are trying to sell me this book. You asshole. Asshole? I'm trying to warn you. This guy is not Dr. Wonderful. He traumatized my fiancée so badly, she can't even pull out of it. - He's turned a couple-- - That's enough! I don't want to hear anymore. I want you out of here. One more thing. That guy Danny-- - That's my brother. - Well, look at him. - [ chainsaw buzzing ] - His face is so white, he looks dead. He had a late night. Oh, so he hasn't seemed any different to you lately, huh? - [ chainsaw continues ] - Jesus, Danny. The only thing different about my brother is he's taken up the most irritating new hobby. Good-bye, Mr. Martin. Martin... Planting. [ sighs ] [ vacuum hums, stops ] Oh... jerk. [ sighs ] [ birds chirping ] [ Tyler crying ] Hey, sweetheart. Hey. Mommy's here. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Come on. What's the matter now, huh? What's the matter, huh? Shh. Oh, not again. Come on, not again. Here, I've got a bottle for you, sweetheart. Let's try the bottle. Come on. It's nice and warm. Here. Want the bottle? - You want the bottle? - [ crying continues ] Oh, come on. All right, all right. No bottle, no bottle. Shh. [ sighs ] Come on, let's go. Danny? [ knocks on door ] Danny? Danny? - Hello. - Hi. Okay, now... How's this? - Okay. - Okay. - And? - [ wincing ] Ow. - How's that? - It hurts. - Okay, and...? - [ gasps ] All right, I'll tell you what. I'll send somebody down, we'll pop you an X-ray, take some pictures and see what you've got, all right? - Okay. - Okay. Thank you. [ Tyler crying ] [ door opens, closes ] - Doctor, we have-- - I know. I know. I'll meet you in radiology. Are you all right? - No, it's Tyler. - [ screaming ] Come in. I don't know what started him off. He just started screaming. He was actually fine today. Hmm. Has there been any fever? I don't think so, no. Okay, here, let me take him. Come on, then, big boy. Ooh! Nurse, could you please take him to 1234? Thank you. See you, Tyler. [ PA chimes ] Woman over PA: Dr. Corday. Dr. Corday, reception. [ sucking ] [ laughing ] You're crude, Tom. Is the baby hungry? I'd love to feed him. [ belches ] Excuse me. [ laughing ] There is no excuse for you. Clean up your mess and get out. I haven't had my dessert yet. Where's Nina? She's not your concern. Oh. That's mighty protective of you. Downright fatherly. Have you gone deaf, Tom? Now get the lady out of here. You see, I don't care how you do it. Just do it, okay? - Tom: You know what boggles my mind? - [ sighs ] What's that, Tom? A coincidence. Here we have a kid who's six months old. You go back another nine months, and where were you, Maxie? In the sack, fucking and feeding. I told you to kill that girl. As a matter of fact, I offered to do it for you. Apparently, we do things a little differently. No shit. And where are you now? You got a kid that's half-turned. What are you going to do? Be a daddy? You are way out of line. Don't-- don't get me wrong. - I'm very happy for you. - Yeah. I mean, your family is my family. You touch them and I'll rip you apart! Okay, okay. You don't need to get upset. I mean, you're really quick on the uptake, aren't you? You can't quite figure out why I picked this hick town. It's a real stumper, isn't it? Hey, I finally got it. Yeah, well get this. I'm changing the rules. There's no more killing. You're shitting me. I've never been more serious about anything in my life. Are you crazy? We're an institution, you and me. You can't just take tradition and throw it out the window. We need the chase! You could always run to the blood bank. Oh, yeah, that's great. That's a lot of fun! Can't you for once in your life just do as I say?! No! Because you're not the final word anymore, pal. You got it? [ flames crackling ] [ gasps ] Danny! Danny! [ gasping, breathing heavily ] Don't be afraid. There's just something I want you to know. You see, there's so much more to me than what you see. But if you can imagine every evil in the world-- well, I carry a piece of it. But there's a good side too, and it's more beautiful than anything you can possibly fathom. I want us to be together, Nina. I've been alone a long time, and I'm tired of it. What you're feeling is meant to be. You're a lamb to the slaughter. Danny! Danny! What? What's the matter? You didn't hear anything? No. You must've been dreaming, Nina. Go back to sleep, okay? [ sighs ] Oh, God. Human blood feast? "Most often the vampire kills its prey. But the beast is also human and sensual. Perhaps for company or the pleasure of seduction, the vampire will seek out an innocent, turning them into a creature of the dark by draining their blood in a series of feedings until the victim is weakened to the point of death." "Then the vampire will feed its victim with its own vampire blood and thus undead to wander in bloodlust for the endless nights." - [ gears whirring ] - Man: Whoa, watch your back. Watch your bottom end, there. Bring it up just about a foot. Perfect. Hold on. So what else can I get for you? - Some dock line. - Okay. Do you want medium grey or really grey? - Medium grey. - Good choice. You know, the really great dock lines tend to disappear on you. Do you want this on your dad's tab, too? Uh-huh. There you go. [ tears receipt ] - See ya. - Bye. See you guys. Joe, I'll close up. You go home. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. I want to get this paperwork under control before it buries me. Well, I don't like you staying here too late, not after what happened to the Johnson kid. That was in the woods, Joe. No coyote is going to come down to the lake. I'll only be a while. Well, okey doke. Good night. Good night. Hmm. Howdy. Hi. Remember me? Well, I'd be pretty dense not to. You're Tom, right? Mm-hmm. So what are you doing out here? Baying at the moon. Well, you picked a really good night for it. It's nice seeing you, Tom. Can I help you with something? Help me? Nah. Well, then you'll have to excuse me. I forgot something. Oops. - [ gears whirring ] - Tom: Yee-haw! Ready or not, here I come! [ laughing ] I can taste you from here! [ laughing ] Oh, I just love this! Yeah. Yeah! Aren't I a lucky guy? Nice boat, a beautiful woman. Some guys work their whole lives for this. [ gears whirring ] [ laughs maniacally ] Ha ha. Yee-haw! [ laughing ] [ screams ] Tom: Yeah, that's right! I love it! I admit it. I want it! [ laughing ] - Boo! - Aah! [ Tom laughing maniacally ] No! No! Tom: Ooh-haw! [ laughing ] Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. - Tom: Come to papa, baby. - [ groans ] [ Tom chuckling ] You know something? You look good enoughto eat. I'm sure Max thought so. - Let me go. - Let you go? Not a chance. Get your fuckin' paws off of me. You stay away from her, Tom. You're forgetting your place, brother. This is my place. You play by my rules. You haven't made a kill in months. You're as weak as a puppy. Fuck with me and you'll die. - [ chainsaw buzzing ] - [ woman giggling ] - [ music playing over radio ] - Whoo! Ta-da! What do you think? - Danny, it's wonderful! - All right. Hey. What are you doing,Danny? Oh, hi. Nina, this is Celia. Hello. What happened to you?God. Danny, are you drunk? You shouldn't be using this thing if you're drinking. Come on, relax. We're just having some fun, right? I thought you were making a bear. Are you done babysitting? - Can we get out of here now? - Uh-huh. I think we should go back to my house and install our creation. What do you say, boss? I don't care, Danny. Do whatever you want. I'll leave you alone. Conserve energy. [ chuckles ] Don't bother. [ thunder rumbling ] Ahh! [ growling ] Woman: All right, see you tomorrow. - Woman #2: Drive safely. Good-bye. - Bye. [ car engine starts ] [ thunder rumbles ] [ growls ] [ screaming ] [ panting ] No! [ knocking at door ] [ barking ] [ engine starts ] - [ Tyler crying ] - It's just the daylight, Ty. It's just the daylight. It's okay. Come on. It's okay, it's okay. Where did you go? Does your girlfriend live up at Max's house? Yeah. Yeah. Well, why didn't you tell me? Huh? I was there, Danny. I saw those things you were making. What are you so mad about? I want to know what's going on up there. Nothing! I hang out with Celia. It's a beautiful place, Nina. It's a fucking estate! Don't you-- damn it! Hey, stop! Hey, cut it out! What's wrong with you? What's happening to us, Danny? [ music playing ] - Good night. - Richard, get home safe, huh? - Get you another beer? - No, thanks. Hey, do you know Jane? Uh, you know, tight clothes, short skirts, kind of dark hair? Yeah, yeah, sure. No, she hasn't been around here the last couple of nights. Yeah, I know. I've been here. I was sure she was going to come in. Yeah, yeah. Who knows with women, huh? They're around so long, you'd think they were part of the decoration. And then one day, poof, they pull a Houdini on you. The cape drops down and then a little smoke appears. You never see 'em again. You think you could explain it, huh? You can't. There's just no explaining it. Yeah, well, thanks for the insight. Yeah, it goes with the job. Listen, if she happens to poof back in here, tell her Martin's looking for her. Yeah, yeah, sure. Jane. Shit. Listen, gorgeous, I don't have much time. What's wrong? They saw me with you. - Who? Who did? - The others. I don't know how and I don't know when, but I just ran, Marty. I've been hiding in the woods in somebody's basement. Doesn't matter anyway. The sun creeps in everywhere. Look at me. Oh, Jesus. Not exactly a beauty queen, huh? I gotta get you to a hospital. You need a doctor. Oh, sure, with Max working, right? Out of the frying pan and into the fire. Oh, God. I'm sorry, Jane. This is all my fault. I dragged you into this. Don't worry. I'm gonna help you, doll face. Where's the house? Right there, just on the other side of the hill. See? Between the trees? All right, I don't have much time. I just want you to show me where he sleeps. I'm not going any farther. What am I supposed to do, drop breadcrumbs along the way? Come on! He's at the hospital. He won't know. Yeah, but the sun is almost up. He'll be leaving soon. - Come on, Jane. Let's go. - [ chain rattles ] What was that? I have to get out of here. Jane, you'll be all right. It isn't just Max. Don't tell me. I'm finally getting a little respect around here. I think I like it. Hi. Who are you? I'm your friendly neighborhood tour guide. No, thanks. I brought my own. Oh, she's got other plans. Tom, no, please. You into kinky, Martin? Jane is. How'd you know my name? Because I'm one smart fucker, aren't I? [ laughing ] Tom, please, no. No! - Tom! - Yee-haw. Ride 'em, cowboy! Run, Martin! Let her go! Listen, you little fuck. Stick around, 'cause you're history. You got it? Jane. Ah, shit! Jane! Come along, little doggy. No! Run, Martin! Get out of here! I don't need you! Go! [ crying ] Janie, Janie, Janie. A man's home is his castle. - If I wanted an open house... - [ crying ] ...I would've sent out invitations. Wouldn't I? Wouldn't I, huh? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. Please. So am I. I'm so sorry. No, no-- aah! [ crying ] - Oh, God! - So sorry. - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Tom, Tom. - Oh, Tom... - Ah, baby. I hope you didn't forget your sunscreen. - [ laughing ] - Wait, no! Tom! Tom! No! Tom! Please don't leave me! No! Tom! Plea-- no! Ooh! Oh, God. Help me! [ screaming ] I'm telling you, Max is responsible for what's happening to Danny. But Max didn't do anything to Danny; that girl did. Nina, it all starts with him. - This goes back centuries. - Nobody lives forever. It's time to wake up. Max Schreck is Vlad Tepish. He killed 20,000 people in Romania. He impaled them on spikes and let 'em die, screaming. He staged a banquet for all the unfit in his country, made a big show of his generosity, brought 'em all in, locked the doors, and then he burned it down. Now, you want to turn your brother over to this guy? That guy is not Max. That's what you want to believe. Look, I know what he does to women. You think you're the first one? He had Kate so... hypnotized, I couldn't compete. And you're just like Kate. You're caught up with it. Caught up? You don't know how I feel. Look, I'm going to the police. I'm gonna show 'em where the house is. I'm gonna get it done while it's still light. Well, what if you're wrong? I'm not wrong. Just do what I say. Now I'm coming straight back when I'm done. You wait for me, understand? Wait for me. [ chatter on radio ] - [ tires screeching ] - Whoa! Oh, shit! [ grunts ] Hey, I brought you lunch. Oh, what's that smell? - It's chicken soup. - [ moans ] Oh, come on, Danny. Stop it. I've had enough. Oh, my God. Danny! How could you let her do this to you? I like it. Well, it's over. I want you back, Danny. You're gonna stay awake and you're gonna eat this. - Get the fuck away from me! - [ screams ] [ Tyler crying ] Hi, sweetheart. Tyler, come here. Come here. Mommy's here. Mommy's here. Come on. Oh, yeah, it's okay. It's okay. Are you hungry? You've gotta be hungry. Come on. It's not that bad. Come on, now I know you need this, sweetheart. Come on. Come on. Let's have something to eat. Come on. [ sighs ] Come on, now. Come on, now. Come on. You can do it. Come on. Let's try it again. Let's try it again. Oh, baby, come on. Come on. Shh. Shh. Come on, let's try to go back to sleep, baby. Come on, come on. Oh, come on. Come on. It's okay. - [ crying continues ] - Shh. Woman on PA: Dr. Stern, Dr. Stern, please call the operator. Is Dr. Schreck in? No, I'm sorry. He's off tonight. Dr. Mason can help you. Uh, no. [ Tyler screaming ] Nina! Nina! Shit! [ Tyler crying ] Danny, where's Max? - What? - I need to see Max. - Max. - Nina, what's the matter? Tyler's sick. Celia: I love you, Danny. Quickly, come with me. I want to know what's going on. - Let me see my boy. - Your boy? He's my son, Nina. What are you talking about? He's not your son. He needs to eat. - I tried feeding him. - You're starving him. - Don't you understand? I can't stand it anymore! - Max! He can't be half in your world and half in mine! No, Max! No. It's feeding time at the OK Corral. No! Give me my baby! Unh! You make one move and I'll break his little neck. You got it? This is an unhappy baby, Maxie. But don't you worry. Don't worry about a thing. 'Cause old Tommy is gonna bring him in all the way. Nina: No. Max: This has gone too far. Just let him go! Max, do something. No, Tom. Don't do this. Yum, yum, baby. - Nina: Max! - You son of a bitch! - Nina: Tyler. - Get out, Nina! Get out! I'm not through with you. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm through with you. [ shouts ] See ya. [ laughing ] - [ Tyler crying ] - Danny! Danny! Oh, Danny... Are we having fun yet? Atta boy, Danny. Nice work. Now step aside. Danny... Come here, Danny. Danny... Come on, baby, give me the kid. No, stay away. Come on, baby, give me the kid. No, stay away. Look, I'm a patient man... up to a point. [ chainsaw buzzing ] Tom: I've got both of you, any way you slice it. So you give me the kid before I really get upset. Do you understand? Stay away from us. Tom: I guess I'm not making myself very clear. Give me the kid! I'm gonna cut you up. Don't do this. No! - Danny! - No! Danny! Oh, God! Off with your head. Celia: You shit. [ yelling, grunts ] You arrogant bastard! You still think power's about breaking the rules. You can't control me. Aah! [ Tyler crying ] No, Tom! - No! - Nina: Max, just let Tyler and I leave. - Nina, listen to me. - No! [ yells, grunts ] Max! Tom: You're dead now, buddy boy. [ chainsaw buzzing ] - No! - [ grunts ] [ screams ] You tear the beast up pretty deep. - [ groans ] - [ gasps ] Tom! [ groaning, mutters ] Bloody fuck. - [ shouts ] - Sorry, brother. - Give him to me, Nina. - No, get away. Look at him. He's going to die. - [ Tyler crying ] - Max, please. Please. He's my son, Nina. I won't let him go. And you can't change what he is. No. No, Max. Please, let us go. I can't. I have to protect him. Don't you understand? There are too many others. They'll come for him and they'll teach him how to kill. Look at me, Nina. Look at me! Is this what you want? I can't change what I am, Nina. But you have to trust me. I want you with me. Don't deny our love. Nina, the darkness can be so beautiful. Please let me show you. - [ grunts ] - [ pierces ] [ Tyler screaming ] Aah! You fool. You stupid fucking fool. Do you think you're a match for me? - Huh? - Get away from me. Oh, you bastard! Oh! [ groaning ] Oh, no! Oh, no! [ screaming continues ] [ both crying ] No! [ instrumental music playing ]
