Alex bud find your own girl. Yeah I think I'll do just that. Oh sput. - If you want me I'll be in the fun fair. Fun fair? Oh right, let's all go. That was great! More like terrible. Can we do it again? - No thanks, twice is quite enough for me without a break. That's what he says every night. Wow, come on. - Come on Jan let's go and see the fortune teller. She might find you a real man at Harvester Hall. Thanks. - I told you she was going round with us again. You're staying on here. Please. One more time around. Come on love. Please! Round you go. Help! Please help! Stop! Please let me off! Hey come on. Hey look at that. Help! Help! - Hey leave her alone now! - Please! Come on. Help! Hey leave her alone! Come on leave her alone. Go away! Go away! You alright? Yes. Let's get out of here. - Hey, you won't get far without this. Na na na na na. Na na na na na. Tom over here! - I have a strong feeling suddenly that you should be told these things. Think about time like a river running forever. - Don't tell Leslie about rivers, she hates water. Shh. Please go on. When you stand beside the river you only see a very small part of it but if you go to a great height then you can see more of the river. In my crystal I can see there- - Quick, let's get the wagon, we got trouble, come on. You know what hand it over. Tom! Rick! - Oh God I forgot about the trailer. - You know I never thought I'd be scared in one of these places. Hi guys, meet Carol. Hi. Shhh. Get off! Come on get off! Oh shit! Get him off! Be careful Spud! It's okay. - Glad you decided to come along Carol. Oh thanks Leslie. I'm really glad to be here, my friends don't get in until tomorrow. Well you've made Spud's day, his friends never get here at all. I'm just very choosy. I've been saving myself for a gorgeous American girl to come along and look after her. That's what I do best. - Yeah well what you do worst is steering Rick's boat. You want me to take over? You never give up do you Tom? Ever since I was four years old and Rick gave me his old bike to play with you've been chasing around behind me with a wrench and good advice. - And ever since I was four I've been listening to your rotten jokes and they don't improve with age. Shit what was that? Carol come on. - I'm taking over, there's an island ahead, could be hit the rocks. - Hey my feet are getting wet, there's water coming in. - Look Spud you get the tiller. Get outta my way. - There's water all over the floor. Tom, you know I can't swim. - Well don't worry we'll soon be close enough to wade in. I can't wedge it, start bailing folks. Bailing? Oh Rick I'm scared. We're going to sink aren't we? - Look Rick can you bring the sail in? Maybe someone on the island. Sit down Jan! You'll tip us all out. " Help! Help we're sinking! We really are sinking now. What do you want me to do? Oh Rick it's terrible. It's too much water. Are you alright Janet? Quick come with me now. Tom I'll drown! Your hands off! Well, that was fun. What do we do for the rest of the day? - Thanks a lot Spud that's all we need. Wait for me. Come on. Tom. Here. - Either a horse or a cow, long time ago. Come on. This way. Ah Shit. Barbed wire. Careful it's rusty. It's all over the place. - Careful Jan some of it's half buried. Dead horses and barbed wire. I don't like this place. Hey look at this. I don't believe it. Do you think anyone ever made it here without crashing? - I bet they had a rough time yeah. Oh careful. - I wonder what sort of plane this is. I've got no idea. It's all very interesting Tom but I'm freezing. - That's the first bit of luck we've had all day. We don't have to ask for any favors we can just check in and get cleaned up. Hot baths. - If we've found the mainland maybe someone could winch the boat out. No it's in pieces by now. It's an insurance job. - It seems like a nice place maybe we should stay the night. What's going on? It's only July. A merry Christmas. - And a happy new year to you. Yes and the same to you. So where's my present? - It must be some kind of gag. This stuffs all fresh. Look it's lovely. Hello, anyone home? - Hey, I wonder where they keep the mistletoe. - Look you guys can stand around soaking wet if you want to but I wanna get warm and dry, now. Hello. Is anybody in here? I'll light the fire. - Carol's right, we should all get dry. I'll check up here for someone. - I'll come with you, might find some shoes. - Do you two wanna hang on down here in case someone comes in? Anything- Come on, let's find someone. Oh useless. They've gone crazy. Look at this. - They've been watching to many late night movies. Well I suppose we might as well have a drink. What can I get for you madam? What have you got? Let's see. See if I can get some lights on. Strange, doesn't seem to be any power. - It's an island maybe the supplies weird. What's the matter? - There was a face at the window and then it was gone. I'll go and look. Well, I couldn't see anything. Must've been one of the ground staff. Probably. Look at this, I thought my Aunty Linda was the only one who kept this kind of stuff. Answer three simple questions and win Michael Landis's sweatshirt from I Was a Teenage Werewolf. Flaughs) Well where were we? Drink? Oh, something warming, brandy. Lesley. Brandy, well these'll have to do. - No I don't want a glass like that, put it in a proper glass. Alright brandy glasses. Sorry I snapped at you before. Just suddenly everything seemed so stupid. I don't even know what I'm doing here I just went to the fun fair to kill a little time. - Yeah, we've all had a hell of a time. You're still shivering. I'll go and try and find you a blanket. Thanks. - Hello, we rang the bell when we came in. Oh I hope you don't mind about the fire I was so cold. - Oh that's alright my dear, you rest here and make yourself comfortable. - Have you seen any of my friends yet? Just slip out of your wet things and put this around you. Don't worry about the others, they're all being take care of. Oh, well thank you very much. Rick? Rick are you there? Oh you. # That is true # There is nothing you can do # For your love is not enough # Your love is not enough Hello? Hello! # I lost my only friend # Hearts do break but hearts can mend # And I know to well just what it's like to feel # How you do today so come and take my hand # Brush those tears away # It takes you shakes you # Burns and breaks you # I don't know where you're going # But the going gets rough # Yes you hurt but it's true # There is nothing you can do # When love is not enough # When love is not enough # Takes you shakes you # Burns and breaks you # Don't know where you're going # But when the going gets rough # Yes it hurts but it's true Weird. I've gotta get out of this place. Are you sure this is okay? All this stuff must belong to someone. - Don't worry I'll settle up when we find them. There you go. Gotcha. I'm sure this is all fancy dress for parties. That would explain the Christmas stuff too. A special Christmas '50's weeks. They'll probably all go down to the beach and act out those beach party movies. The guys taking it in turns to be Frankie Avalon. I'd rather be here. All I need now is a caddie. Are you alright? You look as if you've seen a ghost. I'll be alright in a second. - Hmm, you look great you know that. These are dead too. I wonder what it's like, doing it on a snooker table. Doing what? Lesley, God. We've gotta sort out the power business first. It'll be dark soon it'll be silly stumbling around if it's just the fuse that's gone. - As you seem to be king of the fuses I'll see if I can find you a few more to play with. I wonder where you find all this stuff. - Shall we go and look for the fuse box? Fine. Fine. Ha. Flaughs) Hey, the fuses might be down here. The first bit of organization I've seen in this place. Found one. - Didn't you see the sweet little housemaid? There are people here. Oh yeah, there are people here, they just don't wanna know us. If you ask me this whole place is crazy. Everyone just wants to play games. Look, let's just find the others and get the hell out of here. - We can't go anywhere without a boat. - It really wouldn't matter if we didn't find the power Tom. Eh? We could be very cozy, upstairs. Oh no. In the dark. No, no. Are my seams straight? Oh. - Oh hey, you don't have to feel seams to check. And I don't have seams up there. Lesley, Lesley please. We must help Rick and the others and get these lights turned on. Anything for Rick. He calls, you jump. - Yeah well, you'd jump fast enough if he called you. Come on Lesley help me light the candle. Beside that all the fuse box is always in the darkest corner. Come on. What the hell's going on? - Have to leave this place it's completely weird. What do you look like? I think this place is definitely a mad house. - Do you think this place really is a mad house Rick? Don't be stupid Jan. What's happening Tom? We just switched the power on. - Come on we'll show you where to change. There's loads of stuff upstairs. - Don't tell me Jan you're wearing stockings. Why not? It's a bit fun. It was a joke. - Provide ground answer broadcast unit showing the B29 support plane which is monitoring the experimental aircraft, we should at anytime be getting air to air pictures from this monitoring plane. In the meantime, back to the studio. - Professor Kaplan you were describing for us, your experimental anti radar device which you launched in the open hours of 1960. - Bending light, making the plane invisible. It's interfering with light, with time itself, playing God, very, very dangerous. - Please gentlemen I must ask you to control your outcries. - If I could get a chance to say anything at all. - Gentlemen we're all scientists here and we don't enhance the image of our profession if we keep making outbursts. The public expects a balanced discussion- - The public expects protection from us not danger. Hey Lesley how about this? Oh very you. Are there any small jeans in this pile? I might wear it myself. You keep your clothes on, I had enough trouble getting you into that lot. - Well, well, well old age is creeping up on you Rick. Janet offers to strip and you complain? Where's Carol? I think she's in the other room. - Yes well we would appreciate pictures as soon as you have them. Well there has been a slight delay in getting pictures from the monitoring plane, a small technical hitch that is being dealt with as quickly as possible. You see, in an experiment as ambitious as this one- This is one of my points - Why don't we all go downstairs and have a drink? Yeah what a good idea eh? - By monitoring an aircraft in the air we hope to demonstrate our invention safely by causing that aircraft to become invisible for one full second. Hi honey, that's nice. Hi. You look really nice. Thanks. You know, hey guys, this has got to be one of the craziest days of my life. I mean we just met in the fun fair, we crashed up a perfectly innocent ghost train and now we're stuck in a time warp. - Oh Rick do you think we are in a time warp? No we're not. Shhh. - We are facing a new from of- I can hear something. Voices, definitely voices. Yeah I can hear something. - Well come on, let's go and check it out. - Oh it's been so long since Jeff left. - It's one thing we didn't think of, the staff are all in here watching movies. I'll bet the boss is away. - Colonel, we're almost out of ammunition. - This is crazy, showing films to an empty cinema. - Maybe we should watch it. - There must be a real joker about. Let's see if he's still in the projection room and stop him from setting up his next trick. Is this seat free? We owe it to you Major and it strikes me you are setting a very good example. I don't believe this. Come on Rick where's the film? Rick come on. That's better. Oh I recognize that place, the Grand Island Hotel. She's very nice, I bet you like her Tom. Hello there. I think she likes me. Oh and another one as well, very nice, yeah. Oh hula hoop is it? I can do that as well. Do you wanna see me do it. Right here I go. Look at that eh, brilliant. Look. it's the Sheik of Arabia. Here we go, I can do just as good as this. Come on Spud! What's happening to him? Spud. What happened? - There was this thing, it came out of the film and killed Spud and then it flew up into the light. He's really dead. What's Jan on about? I know it sounds crazy but it happened just like she said. - I saw it happen and I still don't believe it. Jan,Janet! Jan. Calm down. Come on it's alright. Spud must've had some sort of massive electric shock. That would explain the burns. - You weren't there, you didn't see! It was horrible. - Well I had a hell of a belt from that projector. - There have to be other places on the island. A look out station or something. They'd be in touch with the mainland. Janet come here, Janet. Carol? - Oh you guys go, I'll wait here for Janet and Rick. Come on Lesley. God, poor Spud. - You saw it Tom, there really was a creature whatever Rick says. - Look there's more to what Rick says than meets the eye. It was dark, we've all had a jumpy day. Hey look. - I don't care if there's anyone at home or not, if there's a phone in here I want to use it. Help get it off me! Please get it off me Tom please! Stay still! ' My face! Hold still. - My face Tom just get it off my face please! My face Tom get it off me please! Hold still! Oh no! - I can't help you if you don't hold still. - Oh Tom there's something under my leg! There's something un! - Lesley will you hold still? - It's around my leg, there's something around my leg! Tom please help me! Hold still! Look Lesley hold still. I can't help you if you don't hold still. Don't move, I'll get it. Alright, careful. You stay still. Alright. You're hurt, let me see. Leave me alone. I'm fine, just some stupid cuts. Find something to wipe them with. Oh! Damn and blast this place! - There's some stuff on the table, let me. I'll do it myself. ' Happier now? - I hope I'm not wearing their clothes. Don't be silly. Look. Why can't we see them? Come on. Rick. They've gone but, but why couldn't we see them? Shit, what was that? Rick? Janet? Rick? Janet? Hey wait! Hello? You gave me the blanket remember? Hello? Hey! I need your help come with me. Rick! Lesley! - Quick Carol something's happened to Tom. You first. There's no sign of Tom. You did say he was here. Help me! Get my legs! I've got a longer reach. Janet hold on to me. Grab hold! Lesley hold on to Janet, okay? Yes. I got him. Bring him in! - I've got you, I've got you. Come on by you. Tom must be down there. No I... - There must be a path down to the cliff. He could still be alive let's hurry. If his bracelet ow! Hey kick him! Ow! Watch out Rick! Rick. Okay hit him again. Get her out of here! Let's get back to the hotel we can lock ourselves in. I'm not going back there again. I'm getting away from here. Even if I have to swim all the way. Jan! Help me! Please help! Don't panic Jan. I can. Take my hands. I can't let go I'll fall. Grab her arms. It's alright Janet. Pull. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright Jan. It's okay Jan. Come on. Come on, let's go. This is a nightmare, just awful. - I can't believe what's happening. I see things and I just can't believe 'em. - Maybe if we stay here and be very quiet then they'll leave us alone. - You must be crazy to think that'll happen. Whatever's out there won't let anyone go. - You can't swim that far, you'd drown for sure. We've got to hang on together. It's our only chance. At least we've got a better chance than the others, we know there's something wrong. Those guys at the fun fair. There were three of them. Oh shit you're right. We've gotta get back to the hotel. We're ahead of anyone in the woods. Run for it. Rick the back door. Okay I'll get it. We'll all go. Oh I'm sorry. You've been really kind. I feel as though I'm going crazy. I know, I know. - Do you think we'll ever get away from this island? Of course we will. Shh. - Hey let me in, I'm scared out here. Open the door. Janet are you there? No. - Oh come on, don't leave me outside. - Upstairs, I'll check the windows. I'll check downstairs. Don't leave me here on my own. What's the matter? Can you see something? No, no it's alright. What do we do next Carol? What do we do next? - I don't know but I'll think of something. # Baby do the caveman rock # Oh baby rock rock rock with your caveman # Do the caveman rock # Oh baby rock rock rock with your caveman # Do the caveman # Rock rock Rick help! Rick! Where are you? Rick help! Lesley! - Don't Rick don't, come away from it. What about the gun? There's no more cartridges. Come here. Rick not in there. - God I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Rick promise me something. If anything happens, if they get us. They won't get us. Don't worry. - No listen Rick, if we become like Lesley- We won't. We don't know that anymore. If we do, please promise not to attack me, I'd never attack you. Those guys at the fun fair, they must've had a boat. - Oh, why didn't we think of that before? Come on. Oh Tom. God we thought you'd gone over the cliffs. Lesley. It's Lesley? She's, she's... Let's go. Tom. It's Lesley. She, she's. Tom can you hear me? Careful, be careful. Lesley. Lesley. Those fun fair guys are here. We're gonna try and find their boat. Can you make it down to the beach if we help you? Must warn the others. Warn Janet. Jan. Tom do you understand? Warn Janet. I'll stay here with Tom. Just find the boat and come back to us. - The quicker we go the quicker we'll be back for them. Okay. Rick, you will come back? As soon as we find it. Just rest both of you. What is it? I don't like leaving them. - They couldn't go any further right now. - We should find a different stretch of coast this way. Come on. - They won't get through this door in a hurry. What's the matter? I'm not sure. I think someone's watching us. Hey! Hey you! Wait! This one's different he's running away from us. Rick be careful! Rick. Mayday, mayday- Mayday, mayday operation mirror instrument failure. Listen. Mayday, mayday- A radio? - Mayday, mayday operation mirror instrument failure. Our position is six north, three west, altitude unknown. Mayday, mayday. Mayday, mayday operation mirror instrument failure our position is... Mayday, Mayday operation mirror instrument failure. Our position is six north, three west, altitude unknown. Mayday, mayday. Come on we must find the boat. There it is, escape. - Try to rest, the others will find that boat and come back, we'll be away before it gets dark. - You're so nice Jan, so kind, so soothing. I've always liked you Jan. I always liked you the best. But you were Rick's girl. Rick's the leader, the rich boy so he gets the best girls. Oh no, no not you too. The prettier girl. Please not you too. - Come on Jan, I have some nice dirty games you'll enjoy. Rick doesn't know 'em. Get away you bloody bastard! I guess we wouldn't play 'em. You and me Jan, you and me. Hey Jan, what are you playing at? Give me a hand here. I'll show you. Come on Janet. Come on Janet. Oh my God. Janet Janet! Janet! Oh God, Janet! Jan are you alright? Jan? Come on! Jan! Come on. Jan! No! Janet! Jan! No! Come on. Don't touch me! Please he's coming. Hey! Please wait. Come on. Let's get out of here. Rick. Please don't listen. Please help me. It's only a trap. Don't leave me. Rick! Rick. Janet! Jan! Rick I need you. Don't leave. - And now ladies and gentlemen we have our two final contestants in the Grand Island Hotel elimination waltz. Let's have a big hand for Rick and Carol! Let me remind you ladies and gentlemen why we are here, we are here to let in the new year in the good old traditional way goodbye 1959 and hello 1960. I hope you're all enjoying yourselves because we're here for a long time, in fact ladies and gentlemen I'll let you in to a little secret, we're here forever. What do you want us for? What have you done with Lesley and the others? - Now dancers no interruptions from the floor. There was an experiment and the experiment went terribly wrong. The government in their wisdom sent up a plane on new years eve, a plane carrying a device that could change the structure of time and matter. This device would shatter time itself and the pilot crashed the plane, here, here on Grand Island and locked us in time forever. Dead or alive, we are all caught in this awful, angry half world and we can't escape, even ever, ever! - I don't know if I can take much more of this. Come on. Try not to think about anything but that boat waiting for us. - ls there any point in locking the doors against them? I have to do something! Hello gorgeous. Did you miss me? Come and join us. You're tired, so tired. Stop fighting now. Stop fighting now. You must. - Come on, we can still make the boat. We've made it! Rick! Rick don't leave me! Oh Rick please! Jan! Rick don't! - Jan! Rick! Rick! Rick! Jan! Rick! Please don't leave. Rick! Rick! Oh Rick don't leave me! No! Help. Help me. # Boy and girl going nowhere special # Boy and girl who's hearts conspire # To bring them hand and hand together # Oh a victor of love # Twisting burning hearts on fire # Take one boy take one girl add a little love # And you shake it up shake it up # That's a recipe for romance # That's a recipe for romance # Boy and girl and a hall of mirrors # Boy and girl and a post train ride # You're getting so taste as the screams get louder # Oh a shiver of fear # And twisting burning and scream inside # You take one boy you take one girl # Add a little love and you shake it up shake it up # That's a recipe for romance # That's a recipe for # You take one boy you take one girl # Add a little love and you shake it up shake it up # That's a recipe for romance # That's a recipe for romance # Take one boy take one girl # Add a little # And you've got you've got a recipe for romance # Take one boy take one girl add a little love # Well you've got you've got a recipe for romance # That's what you've got # Recipe for romance
