"Episode 10" Yes, babe, what did you want to tell me? Frankly, Nisreen, I am so happy about the time we spent together But I... - But... - You are shy, right? I am the one who should feel shy since yesterday I can't believe there is a man who would sign on something without reading its content It is your legal right. You don't know what you did for me last night It made me know for sure that you really love me When you signed the list of matrimonial movables worth 8 million Love makes miracles Eight million? - Eight million? - Yes You can't imagine how much I loved you more when you signed without thinking because you know for a fact you won't divorce me - Eight million pounds? - Yes, babe This is the price I wrote in the list of matrimonial movable Don't worry, this is worthless It won't be used unless we get a divorce, God forbid God forbid What if I want to divorce you now and give you 100 thousand pounds? Cash trumps anything else, right? Babe, you signed on eight million which means you will pay 8 million not 7 million and 900 or even 800 thousand pounds Eight million Change this subject. God forbid What did you want to say to me, naughty boy? There is nothing naughty to be done after hearing about the 8 million Excuse me What's wrong? Are you okay? I will be okay. You are really great I mean it If I don't get my ring back I will stop my medications, I swear Stop it! He will divorce her and you will get it back Here he is So? What did you do, Wassim? You can see it on his face He looks sad for divorcing her - Or he didn't get the change to do it - Sure, after the pigeons and chickens Out with it, did you divorce her or not? - I can't do it - Yeah? Did you fall in love with her, Wassim? - You loved her, Semsem - What love are you talking about? It turns out I signed on eight million worth of movables - What? - How much? Exactly like you heard Eight million pounds I have to pay them first to divorce her Including the ring or not? To hell with you and the ring It costs 11 thousand pounds So? What will we do now? One of you has to lend me the eight million to divorce her I am willing to give you half my life to get married to her - What? - I am saying nonsense I don't have many years left in life to give them to anyone This way, I have to keep on playing till I get the money What do you mean? She will remain your second wife till you get that sum! Don't say this! No one can touch a single hair of me as long as I am your husband - Protect yourself, Wassim - I do Mazo, I need you We have to keep on playing No matter who wins, I will take the money What do you mean? I am going to raise the stakes more now I got you now, fatso - Stop it now, here she comes - Here she comes It is a pleasure to have you Please feel free at my home The pleasure is all ours my daughter competitor - Love you - You are so precious - Love you - You are so precious - Yes - Yes Thanks, love. Mom, please give me this pigeon - She is my mother by the way - She is our mother now No, you are our mother now Excuse me Excuse me, dear From now on, no one will serve you other than me My lovely Semsem Listen, Mr. Mazo We have two kinds of students here The first comes here to play with the private lessons' money and they will pass their exams for sure because they pay us good money Okay As for the other kind, they are really worried about the exams - and we can't afford to lose them - Yes What do you want then? Tell me I want someone to give a geography class as they've been in there for too long You should have said this Here comes Sa'doun Go and give a geography class You are heartless, I know that But can't you see?

Asfoura, you will give the geography class I can't, I will always fail at geography I don't know where we are now - Really? - Yes You answer back now, right? Okay I will give the class But I won't stay for 30 minutes Sound the fire alarm after 10 minutes Okay What's wrong? I am tired. Help me sitting, please I hope I can do it The explosions... You always get hurt in the chemistry class Thank God we had a baby before I started the chemistry classes They really messed me up I know you are worried because exams are around the corner I don't want you to worry You have to study and leave the rest to God But we haven't studied You haven't taught us and we haven't studied Even if you study, it won't be enough Our lesson today will be about... how to make small cheat notes This was my shirt in senior year in high school I invented this way before the physics exams and I have the patent for it I want each one of you to go home and write the entire curriculum on the back of one of his shirts How can we read it when we write it on the back? Cheating requires cooperation You write it on your back so the one sitting behind you can read it If we help each other, we will all succeed Thanks - This is my duty - But I always sit in the front Who will help me then? This is my pants in high school You will write the entire curriculum on your pants There is also the modern way Each one of you will put an earpiece and wear a veil I want you all to wear a veil even Christine the Christian one What about us boys?

The Ministry of Education will give a big bounty to anyone who reports his whereabouts One of his colleagues wrote an official report saying that he was fired for misconduct and that he is forbidden from getting near children and babies I am not the colleague he is talking about You reminded me of something now When I was going down the stairs I stumbled on a document May God protect you I do wish this on your enemies - Thanks, love - Though you don't have any enemies It turns out that this document is a bank statement so I thought the tax authority must be searching for it Remind me of passing by the municipality on our way home You have no idea that he even stole the internet cable form his neighbor who knows nothing about it till now who knows nothing about it till now If the power company knows he is stealing the electric current by a wire he took from the light post down the street Don't wrong him. Maybe the electric meter is registered to his wife's name - No, his name - What? Do you have to say it? You saw that they need help so you are telling them!
