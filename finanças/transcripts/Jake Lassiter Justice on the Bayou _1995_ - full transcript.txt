[MUSIC PLAYING] I can't believe I'm stuck inside lawyering on a day like this. Mondo disgusting. Where do you want this? You're the secretary. File it. Malcolm? Is that official NFL issue, Jake? Oh, yeah. Won it in my last game. You mean the one where you missed the tackle on Regans? No, the one where I missed the tackle on Peyton. I missed the tackle on Regan the game before that. And I just stopped by to tell you that our esteemed senior partner Mr. Marsh McGonagle requests the pleasure of your company in the conference room for a pouring. - Ah. Hand off, Jake. To the linebacking litigator! Here, here! Relax, Philip. We'll remove that disc, zip you up, and have you back on your feet in no time. Ah, great. Melanie will think she's married a gymnast. Ah, I can't wait. Pride and appropriate welcome to the newest member of the firm. As senior partner, I hereby order the offices of Harmon and Fox immediately closed for the day, and direct everyone to the park where, in honor of Jake Lassiter, we will engage in the first annual Harman and Fox touch football game. OK. Here we go. I wish they'd fix that coffee machine. Yeah, I wish they would too. Yes. I wish they'd get some of that gourmet coffee. Suction. Let me get this for you. Sucker. There's a little bouillabaisse started for you. End game. Excellent. There you go. All right! You OK, Big? No. If it hadn't been 15 years. I know. Jake, you OK? Didn't think I was gonna have to wear my knee brace to practice law here. Take it easy. This is for posterity, boy. Can I get an interview? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MACHING BEEPING] I need help! Code blue! Code blue, guys! Coming through, coming through! Come on, let's hook him up. I'll take over. - Here we go. Got it? - Yeah. I got this. OK. Set it at 200. How's his surgeon? Uh, Salisbury. Go to 300. Clear. Nothing, nothing. Call Dr. Salisbury. Good, you found it. OK, hop off there and squat and walk like a duck. Jeez, Roger. It's only been three weeks since you cut on me. Just do it, Jake. Squat and walk like a duck. Come on. - All right. Oh, man. That's amazing. That is amazing. There's no pain at all. Yeah. Oh! I haven't been able to do this since, well, I don't know when. Yeah, well, clean out a little floating cartliage, tired ligaments, and you're as good as new. You know, orthopedic medicine has progressed, Jake, since we played for the Saints. If they'd done this when I was younger, I might still be playing. Oh, I doubt that. I was there, remember? Oh yeah. Whenever I needed a kick in the ass or a point in the right direction, tgere you were. And for that and for this, I don't know how I'll ever thank you, Roger. Well, pay the bill. Well, that's going too far. Here. Take care of that for me, will ya? This is a lawsuit. Got you a lawyer. Oh yeah, well, tell me about it. The estate of Philip Corrigan-- Philip Corrigan the zillionaire real estate developer? Yes, the late zillionaire real estate developer in the person of his widow is suing me for malpractice. He died of an aneurysm after I performed a laminectomy on the L3 L4 vertebrae. English, Roger, please. Well he died a few hours after I removed a slipped disk from his back. And they say the aneurysm was due to a mistake that I made during surgery. It wasn't. It happened hours later. Well, several fellows at the firm specialize in this sort thing. I'll refer one. I want you, Jake. Roger, I just left the public defender's office two months ago. I'm just now getting my toe wet over there at Harman and Fox. This is a technical lawsuit for 5.6 million dollars. I don't care. I don't want a hired gun. I want you, Jake. I trust you. And you know that I'm a good doctor. Besides, the Doctor's Medical Insurance Trust will pay you $300 an hour. Dr. Watkins, when the surgeon is performing this particular procedure, can he see what he's doing in there with this implement-- the rongeur-- or does he go by feel? That depends. Beg pardon? That depends-- is that what you said? Yes, counselor, it depends on at what point in the procedure you're referring to. Ultimately, the rongeur poses no danger itself. Hm. My client, Dr. Roger Salisbury is a respected member of the medical fraternity in this community. Mrs. Corrigan here has lost her husband. And you, sir, are visiting New Orleans to offer us expert medical testimony. And the best you can come up with is that depends. Objection-- argumentative and repetitious. Miss Thibeaux. Judge, Mr. Lassiter is making speeches again. If the surgeon's too hasty or too rough or loses track of where he is, that's where the real danger lies. Objection, Your Honor-- the witness is the one speech-making now. Sustained on both counts. Strut your stuff when it's appropriate, counselor. Your Honor, may I request a five-minute recess at this time. We'll take a 10-minute break. (WHISPERING) Roger. What in the hell are you doing in there? What are you talking about? I saw you making eyes at the widow, Roger. How long you known her? Why don't you worry about you're cross-examination, Jake? Don't you screw with me, pal. I'll take this whole case and ram it so far down your throat you'll need a proctologist to get it out. Why would you bust Dr. Watkins chops? I'm taking care of that. If that's not good enough for you, get yourself another lawyer. Jake, wait, wait, wait. Answer the question. A lot of doctors know their patients wives. I mean, what difference does it make? What d-- well, I tell you, Roger, it confuses me. And if it confuses me, it just might confuse the jury. And if it confuses the jury, they're not going to think you're so innocent. - Yeah. Yeah. I understand. I'm sorry. I should have told, Jake. I'm sorry. [BEEPER] - Is that you? No, it's me. I still have a medical practice. For now. Now, you go ahead and return your call. When you get back in that courtroom, you keep your eyes to yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? I don't want to discuss this on the carphone. No, don't give me that "relax Melanie" crap. They can listen in on carphone conversations. Look, I miss you too, but you're just going to have to keep your distance until this is all over with. [BEEP] Tell us about your husband-- your late husband-- Mrs. Corrigan. Phil was the most giving man I've ever known. After his first wife died, he thought he could never love again. I guess I brought something to his life, but to me he was everything-- a lover, a friend, even the father I never had. (WHISPERING) I think she means sugar daddy. And for him to die like this in his prime, it's just-- (CRYING) Your witness. Your Honor, we feel that it would be unfair to keep Mrs. Corrigan on the stand any longer to discuss this painful subject. We have no questions. [KNOCKING] Been out sleuthing. I hope they got what you wanted. What is this? "Across the river a voice to shine tempus fugit doc speaks at 9:00." - I managed that much on my own. - It's haiku. Who? I do. What do you do? I do haiku for me-- something new. Haiku is three line Japanese poetry, no breaking hearts, just recording the author's observations of nature and the human experience. What does it mean, metaphorically speaking? Get with it boss. Crazy old Charlie Briggs testifies tomorrow at 9:00. He'll tell one and all what killed filthy rich Corrigan. The widow loses. You keep lawyering. Salisbury keeps doctoring. We hope. Why the uncertainty? Charlie's the best witness we have. I got a bad feeling about this case. Your Dr. Salisbury has a weird look in his eye. You know this could be one of them pot and kettle things. What'd you find out? The late Mr. Corrigan had a daughter-- only child. Her real mother died five years ago, leaving Phillip a very rich widower and his daughter sole heir to Phil Corrigan's $100 million real estate fortune until the old man married Alvima Fantastic, and that would be Melanie Corrigan, and kicked forthwith. - And? Her name is Susan. I can't believe that Phillip Corrigan was her father, and I didn't even know it. You know her? One date a few years ago. She's a sports reporter, works for The Times Picayune, covers the Saints. Undergrad work at Tulane. Master's in-- Uh, yeah, thank you. Thank you. --Journalism at Northwestern. Pick him up. Pick him up. - Set blue 32. - Set. Blue 32. Hike. You stay on top of him. You hear me? I don't want to see that. If you'd been able to do that while you were playing, you might still be on the team, Jake. I doubt it. He didn't cover the tight end over the middle, was a sucker for a play action fake, and a step too slow besides. Oh, and I see you two know each other. Hey, hey, hey, since when did you start throwing to girls anyhow, Tom? Oh, when we became sports writers and he finally started hearing intelligent questions that required-- I don't know-- sophisticated answers. Well, I'm out of here. - I'll call you, OK? - OK. Thanks. OK, now that you've screwed up my interview, what do you want? Well, actually, I came by to express my condolences over your father's passing. Thanks, accepted. Is that it? No. Kind of curious as to why you didn't join in the suit. Well, you know I represent Roger Salisbury in the suit that was brought by your stepmother. You're dumber than you look. What is that supposed to mean? You really don't know, do you? Would you give me a break here? What are you being such a hard case for? MAN: Head's up! Good hands. For a girl. That's not what I said. It's what you thought. I think I can change your mind. - Oh yeah? Yeah. I am a trained professional athlete, you know? Yeah, well, why don't you just choose your game and your stakes. All right. Dealer's choice. Good. I win, and you tell me what it is that I don't get. Uh-huh. You win, I won't bother you anymore. Great. Uh, I'll race you to the goal line. Think you can catch that one? All right. Guess you're going to want a head start, huh? Yeah, go. Whoa, hey. Hey. Once a linebacker, always a linebacker. [LAUGHING]. Maybe we should have tried this four years ago, huh? Oh. You OK, Susan? Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Let me know if you need anything. I will, thanks. It's OK. You really don't know, do you? Susan, what are you trying to say? You are being used. The suit you're trying is a cover, and that surgeon and my stepmother Melanie are in this together. And you, my friend, are still a sucker for the play action fake. Melanie and Roger conspired to kill your father so they could live happily ever after on the inheritance. Your client isn't guilty of medical malpractice, counselor. He's guilty of premeditated murder. [MUSIC PLAYING] It wasn't murder, Jacob. You've been retained to defend a simple civil suit. Just do your job. Ah, you're right, Charlie. You're always right. I don't get it. You eat that garbage all the time, probably going to live to be 102. What are you talking about? 40 years a pathologist, I never declared anybody dead from cholesterol poisoning. This is New Orleans, Jacob, the Big Easy. And you eat like a refugee from a California fern bar. Life is to be savored not picked at. You're not going to spring any surprises on me in court tomorrow, are you? Nope. My lawyering's a good deal like my footballing-- nothing tricky about the defense. Besides, what jury's not going to believe Charles w. Riggs, MS. Just leave out the part about how you never had a patient who lived. How did you ever get to play linebacker? You eat like an anorexic ballerina. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stop it, dammit. Still driving that thing? '69 Olds 442-- four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust, 400 of Detroit's finest cubic inches producing 345 horses. You know, it sounds like it has asthma. You don't mind, I'll take a look at it for you. Help yourself. You know cars? Yeah, and the men who use them to compensate for certain inadequacies. I think I know what the problem is here. Unbelievable. You know, change your air filter once or twice a decade, she might stop sounding like Joe Cocker with black lung disease. Would it be premature to ask for your hand in marriage? What if I invite you inside for a drink? Tell me I'm right about you. Tell me you want to know the truth about my father's death. Susan, you got it all wrong. It's not even possible for Roger Salisbury to have killed your father during that operation, not if you know the time and the cause of death. I'm telling you, someone murdered my father. Can you prove it-- any of it? You think I can? No. If you could, you'd be talking to the cops, not to me. Yeah, I'll bill you. I guess we aren't going to be having that drink. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROWLING] Nothing like a moonlight jog. Rufus extremus. I thought we had a deal. Did you come all the way down here to rag on me. The deal was this. You keep the phone with you at all times as long as you insist on living like a homeless person. One, the phone is kind of a drag to run with. Two, I am not homeless. I'm address-less, and there's a big difference. Well, not one that I could explain to your father. [BARKING] Listen, when your old man recruited me to play for him in college, he told me that he was going to be like the father that I never had. And he kept his word. When he called me and told me that you're going to be moving here, I told him that I would look after you like you was my own flesh and blood. And you have. Ergo, chill out. Not as long as you're living like this. I want for nothing Jake. I have a roof, a bed, a good man-- Arnold-- to keep me safe and warm at night. Every night I come home to one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in New Orleans. Every morning, I wake up to a glorious sunrise. And every week I put most of my paycheck in the bank. The economically prudent fiscally responsible daughter, every father's dream-- she never asks for money. You make it all possible, and I love you like a brother for it. Well then, why don't you just move into my house? You know, occasionally brothers and sisters do live under the same roof. Alpha, no one at the office would buy it. Beta, no offense, but your neighborhood-- it's not a happening occurrence. Now, are you just calling to check up on me, or did you want something, bro? I was just checking up on you. Uh-huh. Thought so. Arnold. [BARKING] Dr. Riggs, based on the records and your years of experience, do you have an opinion as to what caused the death of Philip Corrigan? I do. And what was the cause of death? A ruptured aorta, internal bleeding, which in turn caused the lowering of the blood pressure. In layman's terms, the heart did to not have sufficient fluid to pump, so it stopped. And what, sir, caused the rupture? We can't answer that with absolute certainty, but we can exclude certain things. Such as? I can tell you that Dr. Salisbury certainly did not do it with a rongeur. May I use the chart? Please, sir. Thank you. The rupture was on the anterior side of the aorta-- the front. The surgeon making an incision in a man's back would not puncture the front of the aorta, the part facing the abdomen. Well, now, if Dr. Salisbury did not puncture the aorta, what did cause the rupture? We call that spontaneous aortic aneurysm. And did Philip Corrigan have any prior medical abnormalities that might have caused this to occur? This Mr. Corrigan had a previous history of some degree of arteriosclerosis-- weakening of the arteries-- a susceptibility to aneurysm. In that condition, Mr. Corrigan could have had an artery blow out at any time. At any time. Without trauma-- watching television, having dinner, anytime. Thank you, doctor. Your witness. [MUSIC PLAYING] You were great today, counselor, earned every penny my insurance company pays you. Which is a lot better than you deserve. Hey, hey, I work hard to make those malpractice premiums. You know, Rog, I quit the public defender's office because I was tired of getting off dirt bags that I knew were guilty. Well, they didn't deserve a lawyer like you. But at least I could tell when they were lying to me. - How? - Their lips were moving. [LAUGHING]. It ain't that easy with you. Are you saying you think I'm guilty? I'm saying there are things you haven't told me. There is one thing. Melanie asked me to kill her husband. [MUSIC PLAYING] The truth, Roger-- all of it, right now. I met Melanie about 9 or 10 years ago. Julie just divorced me, and I never thought I'd find another woman. You got to be kidding me. I was with Julie since Penn State. I was the arrow, remember-- home every night of the season, medical school from January until July. Anyway, Melanie was a kid, kind of mixed up. She was sort of an exotic dancer so she could pay her tuition to UNL. She called herself Autumn Rain. JAKE: Oh my lord. [MUSIC PLAYING] Anyway, I hadn't seen her for probably six years when Phillip Corrigan invited me over for dinner. I had no idea that he had married Aut-- Melanie. So you two started sneaking around-- out of the way motels, little nooners just for old time's sake, huh? Hardly. I mean, Philip had, shall we say, a few kinks in his armor. He played with the other girls. Melanie played with me. I mean, I know it doesn't sound good, Jake, but that's the way it was. Y'all played house, and she asked you to ace her husband. Well, she said it should just be the two of us, but that Philip would never give her the right kind of divorce. There was some kind of a pre-nuptial. And she said I was a doctor, and I should know about these things. Then she-- she asked me if I'd ace him, as you so eloquently put it. And? Jake, I am a doctor, not a hitman. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR OPENING] [BEEPING] [CAR DOOR CLOSING] [BEEPING] What's happening, big? - Waiting. - Waiting for what? Waiting for Thibeaux's rebuttal witnesses, Dr. Watkins, to show up. She's got a long wait for the good doctor. You didn't kidnap him, did you? Kidnap him? You think that is the only way I could get a guy to buy me a drink. No need to tell me that you bagged Dr. Watkins in some sort of-- are you trying to get me disbarred? It wasn't me. It was my friend. (WHISPERING) Margarita. Who? You know, Margarita the girl, not the drink. Miss Anthropomorphic Tabasco 1994-- hot, hot, hot. The one who's so dumb she thinks the Silicon Valley is the space between her-- BAILIFF: All rise. Civil district court in and for the parish of Orleans is now in session. Miss Thibeaux, called your witness. Your Honor, may we have one moment? You've just had 90 minutes for lunch. Now, do you have rebuttal testimony or not? If not, we'll recess, and you can both close in the morning. The plaintiff recalls Dr. Harvey Watkins. [CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Am I worried? Yeah, I'm worried. You never really know how those jurors think, what they feel, what they know, who they know. [SCREAMING] Give me the blouse. Take it off. You're late. - Roger, relax. - Relax? I couldn't eat lunch. Is it a good thing the jury is taking this long? Hey, Ernest, you got the sports section here? - I'm screwed, aren't I? - Yeah. They're taking this long, they're talking damages, right? I'm screwed. - You watch too much TV, Roger. Jake, verdict. You happy now? - Is that us? - That's us. OK. Roger, you want to wait for your lawyer? Yeah, yeah, come on. Let me get this. [MUSIC PLAYING] The clerk will publish the verdict. In civil district court in and for the parish of Orleans, case number 9418376, Melanie Corrigan, as personal representative of the estate of Philip Corrigan, deceased, versus Roger A. Salisbury, MD, we the jury find for the defendant. - Yes. Court adjourned. Susan called. Two hours, quaff one celebratory brewski, then be there or be square. I used to live in the main house before my dad married that woman. And then I decided to give him a little privacy. But I still do my mile in the pool every night. I want to show you something. That's the salon on the Lanya. - The Lanya? The boat parked outside. Oh. I thought that was non-match. 4,000 sailors on shore leave. Now, wouldn't that make her happy? I bet you didn't know he made house calls, did you? Came across it by accident. I thought it was the Saints game I taped. You want to feel uncomfortable, keep watching. They're just getting started. Melanie gets my dad to join in with that chorus line of bimbo's. Susan, every family has its dirty little secrets. Some of them are better left in the closet. You don't understand. That's not my father. Philip Corrigan-- my father Philip Corrigan-- was a man who valued his dignity and treasured his family. I'm a good person because he taught me to be a good person. That man there, that's not my father. What happened? My mom died. Oh, wow, it was six years ago, before I met you the first time. I was living in Atlanta, covering Georgia Tech. He was alone, and these people came in, and they just showed him things that he'd never seen before-- sick things. By the time I got home and realized what was happening, it was too late. The drugs? How do you go to your father-- the man you adore, the man who gave you everything-- and tell him? He would have been humiliated. And besides, he changed. He was like them. You hate him for that? No. I love him still. That's why I want you to help me catch his killlers. [MUSIC PLAYING] Susan, listen to me now. They changed him, and they corrupted him, but that doesn't mean anybody killed him. Your father died of an aneurysm. That happens to 61-year-old men, no matter how rich they are, and no matter how much their daughters love them. Your client's the only one I know who cut my dad open the day before he died. And as far as I know, he's the only one who carried poison around in his little black leather case. What are you talking about? The murder weapon-- succinylcholine, a drug used in anesthesia. It paralyzes the limbs and the lungs. In anesthesia, a respirator breathes for you. Without a respirator, you just lie there and watch yourself die. Where'd it come from? Found it in Melanie's bedroom, but it belongs to your client. She played him, counselor. She manipulated him, just like she manipulated my father. She hated my father, but she couldn't divorce him. She'd get nothing because of the pre-nuptial agreement. But if he died while still married to her, she'd get the house, the boat, and 50% of a $100 million estate. That's a lot of money. In your profession, counselor, I think they call that a motive. When the mosquitoes are biting better than the catfish, I thought that sauteed possum would be a hell of a way to go. Charlie, in the category of things too ugly to eat, possum's right up there at the top of the list. Many things in life are ugly, Jacob. Many ways of dying are ugly. Though few of them are uglier than being poisoned with succinylcholine. Your, um, friend-- Susan Corrigan. Susan Corrigan-- She told you right about that. There must be some way we can determine if it were administered, though. Well, it would be difficult to trace succinylcholine in the body. It breaks down into succinic acid and cholene, and both substances are normally found in the body. Of course, a physician would know that. It would be a flawless way for him to commit a homicide. Yeah, unless we could find the needle marks. No, Charlie, we're not going to exhume Philip Corrigan's body. You would be surprised at how well embalming fluid preserves tissue. But it would be difficult to find needle marks, because the skin would be moldy. That body would smell like ducks with dysentery. Charlie, it's a bad idea. I'm sorry I even brought it up. I mean, Roger Salisbury is my client. I couldn't do anything that would be against his interests. Besides, I know the man. I've known him for 25 years. He couldn't murder anybody. Every killer has a best friend and a mother. You understand the implications of this. Well, there's only one way we could go about it. Charlie, grave robbing is illegal. - Of course. - It's unethical. Damn right. It's disgusting. Here it is. Six generations of Corrigans have been buried here. Don't worry, honey. We'll be careful. I'll see you back at the truck. OK. [OWL HOOTING] [CRASHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] What are the odds that Philip Corrigan could have been buried in a yellow chiffon dress? JAKE: Charlie, doing this on the kitchen counter is disgusting. The skin is macerated. There's substantial mold. There's evidence of two surgical procedures close to death-- the laminectomy and the emergency abdominal surgery to repair the aorta. There is substantial trauma to the abdominal area undoubtedly caused by this procedure. I have found it. What? The puncture wound-- large gauge hypodermic needle, just as fresh as the day it was made. Must have been close to death, or there would be a sign of healing. Well, that could just be routine, right-- connected with the surgery? No, nothing like that in the hospital charts. What about the undertaker. No way. There's a blood trail along the needle track. He had to be alive because-- Dead men don't bleed. That's right. Dead men do not bleed. All right, so somebody injected something into Philip Corrigan before he died. What's next? We check the brain and liver tissue for succinic acid and choline. [SAW STARTING] We'll have to cut into the skull. [THUD] Jake? Jake? What happened? You fainted. Oh. Where's Charlie? Everything I've come up with is inconclusive. I'm going to have to call in a favor and use the toxicology lab downtown after hours. Oh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello? You must be a good man. You're hard to fine. JAKE (ON PHONE): Right. I was wondering if you make house calls, counselor. I wasn't sure about the propriety of my coming into your office, but I do have a proposition. It's a might impressive goldfish. They're Portuguese man o' wars. They make rattlesnakes seem like earthworms, maybe 100 times more deadly. What do you have against angelfish and yellowtail? They're boring. But beautiful. I'm afraid beauty isn't enough to make it in this world, Jake. Believe me, I know. That's why I'd like you to represent me in the future. Why would you need to retain an attorney now? Well, people in my position need attorneys for everyday business and financial matters. And there is that matter of probate. Oh, that was settled, and you got all this. And Susan got the rest. She must have mentioned that. But Jake, that's not what Philip wanted. He died before he could make the changes in his will, which is why this-- this whole thing has gotten so complicated. And I think you could help uncomplicate it. Are you kidding? You just tried to destroy Roger Salisbury. I represented him. If I turn around and represent you, that'll be a big time complication. Besides, Melanie, I know more than you think. Roger told me everything. Did he tell you that he wanted me to kill Phillip, that he talked about it for months? Did he tell you I refused? You know, we all make mistakes in his life, Jake. Roger's mine. He wanted me to divorce Phil and marry him. I wouldn't do it. I loved Phillip. Roger mistakenly had this notion that if Philip was out of the way that I would marry him. So he killed him. Oh, I think that we just proved in court that he didn't. Your husband died of a spontaneous aneurysm. Philip didn't die in surgery. He was poisoned in his hospital room. Yeah. Roger had this liquid in a bottle-- some kind of anesthetic. He wanted me to get Philip drunk and shoot him up. He said it couldn't be traced. He gave you the bottle. No, no, because I wouldn't take it. Then after Philip died, I was at Roger's house, and while he was sleeping, I went took it out of the refrigerator. I wanted to give it to the authorities. Did you? No, no, I had second thoughts. So instead, you sued Roger for malpractice, because if you didn't, and Susan got suspicious, she just might think that you and Roger were in it together? Is that what she said? Show me the poison. I can't. It's gone. It was stolen. And now, Jake, I'm really afraid Roger is going to try to do something to me. Well, then, I guess you better just hope that there is honor among thieves. [MUSIC PLAYING] Who in the hell are you? [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]. Well, Yoko Ono and Macchu Picchu to you too, pal. I'm a trained professional. You get anywhere near me, I'm going to turn you into a tackle dummy. [SHOUTING]. [GROANING]. You're the only dummy here, bubba. Next time, you mind your own business, hear? [GROANING]. [KNOCKING] Hi. Hey. Oh. Cut yourself shaving? Oh, no, there was this karate guy. Oh, oh, well, karate guys can get pretty dangerous. Dangerous? Karate guys? Are you kidding me? You get a hold of those kamakazi sukiyakis, and they fold up like lawn chairs. Now, you can fool me with those moves one time, but Jake Lassiter does not get trap blocked twice. Right. I am a professional athlete trained in a very violent sport. I am bred to accept pain. If I get my hands on that SOB, he's going to be about as useless as nuclear waste. You want some of this? - Yeah. Well, come on in, then. Oh, OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, this won't hurt a bit. Mm-hm. Come here. Ow. Jeez. [LAUGHTER] [WHISPERS] Charles Riggs? Detective Joe Baer, NOPD. Hey, listen to this. From your exalted journal-- vandals destroyed a grave site and removed the body from the Eternal Memories Mortuary and Mausoleum over the weekend, New Orleans Police reported yesterday. The body of Phillip R. Corrigan was taken from a private crypt at the cemetery, according to police spokesman. Mr. Corrigan, who died last year, was a well-known builder and real estate developer whose projects were often opposed by environmental groups. This is funny stuff. This isn't funny, Dennis Lee. Well, I guess it's better they suspect radical environmentalist instead of the real grave robbers. Oh, its-- it's a lot better. I have to say, this is a good way to wake up in the morning. LOUDSPEAKER: Mr. And Mrs. Carters to admitting. Mr. and Mrs. Carters to admitting. [BELL RINGING] I hope you're not wasting my time here, Remy, because I'm having a real bad day. No, child, I'm going make you very happy. Your late husband was a good friend to this district attorney's office. And we take care of our friends. You found his body? And we found his killer, too? I'm-- I'm sorry here, Remy. I don't quite understand. Our estimable retired coroner, much to my surprise, did me a favor and dug up the evidence in a little private post-mortem examination. It seems your husband was murdered, child. His doctor, Roger Salisbury, killed him. It's a sick world, babe, when a man can't trust his own doctor not to kill him. But with any luck, by the end of the year, he'll be on my wall of infamy. What is that? 38 murderers been sentenced to death on my watch, babe. I intend to make Roger Salisbury number 39. When I get through with him, he's going to ride the lightning. Ride the lightning? We still use the electric chair in Louisiana, child. There's one thing I got to know, child. You know, sometimes we say there ain't but 500 people in New Orleans. It's a small town. And I hear that you and this doctor might have had a friendship is what they say. Now, the personal affairs of my constituents and supporters ain't none of my business until it becomes my business. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh god. Bag's gone. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. I'll be right there. LOUDSPEAKER: Dr. Collum to OR 4. Dr. Collum, OR 4. Jake, I'm sorry. Some creep ratted on me. Hey, Jake, you going to defend Dr. Salisbury again? What's the charge? How about murder one? Well, Mr. McGonigal, after I managed to get him released on bail, Dr. Salisbury said he wanted me to represent him. I figured I owed him that much. We try not to dirty our hands with criminal cases at Harmon and Marks, Jake. Our corporate clients aren't fond of being associated with murderers. Well, I'll keep that in mind. And I'll try not to use any of the firm's valuable assets. [MUSIC PLAYING] Evening, Miss Ingram. Now, I understand you have two children. [PIANO PLAYING] Hey, Jim. The firm is not happy. The firm is not going to help. It'll be like the old days, back in the public defender's office. Yeah, the time machine thing-- living history. You'll help. Sure. Good, because it's not going to be good enough just get Roger off. We're going to have to find out who the real killer is. We'll start with Melanie. Why is that? Well, among the other reasons, 'cause she doesn't wear a wedding ring. That bothered me since first time I laid eyes on her. If I were her lawyer, she's playing the grieving widow. She'd be wearing a wedding ring. Um, thank you. Now listen, Cindy, you're going to be working with your friends down at police headquarters. And I'll start at the hospital. Charlie, you-- you better just kind of lay low. I got you in enough trouble for a while. What? You want to bring it up, Jake, or should I? Susan. We're going to have to take a look at her. Charlie she is the one who has insisted all along that this was a murder. If she did it, why would she want an investigation? Did she have the means? Well, that succinylcholine did disappear just as soon as the body was dug up. - Motive? Her father was thinking about writing her out of his will. $100 million Makes people act funny. That leaves opportunity. Yeah, I hear you, Charlie. I'll deal with this. Susan, there are things that I haven't asked you because you're special to me. Like what? Were you aware that your father was thinking about writing you out of his will? Yeah. You know, we discussed it, and he decided against it. All right. You were the first person to show me that hypodermic. [CRYING]. What are you saying? You're saying I love you, but did you murder your father? I didn't say that, Susan. How can you look at me and ask me these questions? How can you believe those people? Susan, please. They murdered my father, and you're trying to blame me for it. I thought you understood. Jake, I thought you knew me. Excuse me, you John Pelegrin? I'm Jake Lassiter. Yeah, yeah, you used to play football. Yeah. Yeah, you missed that tackle on Riggins. Yeah, Peyton and Campbell too. I made all the greats greater. I'm an attorney now. Ooh, congratulations. Thanks. What, lawyering make you lose your hair? I seem to remember had a little-- Were you working this floor the night that Philip Corrigan died? Well, this is a hospital. A lot of people die. Makes it hard to remember. Mm-hm. LOUDSPEAKER: Nurse Julian to C284. Nurse Julian-- Yeah, I was working. Well, what do you remember? See, I had a really bad hangover. I was sleeping it off in one of the empty beds. I think if I was you, I'd talk with Nurse Ingram. Nurse Ingram. Mm-hm. Put that toward a memory course. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BELL RINGING] [KNOCKING] Good morning. Sorry to bother you at this hour, Miss Ingram. You'll see me in court, Mr. Lassiter. Can't it wait until then? It's about what you're going to say there. I think you saw something that night you haven't told anyone about. I told the truth in my deposition. I'll tell the truth on the stand. Miss Ingram, if there's something you are afraid of, we can protect you. Roger Salisbury is a good doctor, and he's a good man. He shouldn't have to pay for something he didn't do. I'm sorry. I've got to get back to my kids. [MUSIC PLAYING] Miss Ingram, did you see the defendant the night of Mr. Corrigan's death? Yes, I saw him leaving room 512, Mr. Corrigan's room, hurrying down the hall. At what time? 10 O'clock. Did you notice anything else about the defendant that night? Yes, he was carrying a little leather valise, black. Thank you, ma'am. No further questions, your Honor. Your witness. Mr. Lassiter. Nurse Ingram, was it unusual to see Dr. Salisbury on the floor that evening? No, he frequently checks on his patients after surgery. Any more questions, counselor? Yes ma'am, one more question. Nurse Ingram, did you see anyone else on the floor that evening prior to 11:15? No. No further questions, your Honor. [MUSIC PLAYING] [VIDEO PLAYING] [CHATTER] Mm. Oh, yes, here we go. Here we go. Look at this. OK. - Oh yeah. Oh yeah. [DIALING] MELANIE (ON PHONE): Hello? I'm watching this videotape. I had no idea you were a thespian. Ooh, I love it when men talk dirty. JAKE (ON PHONE): That's obvious. Don't mess with me, Lassiter. Good, we're on the same page. This is business, not pleasure. You know seeing that, Susan just might want to contest her daddy's will. Yeah, well, how about you bring me that videotape? You mean you want to watch it with me? There's one scene you might be real interested in. Well, now, I'm always interested in a good show. You know, Lassiter, it probably wouldn't be a good idea for us to be seen together. Do you know where Bayou Teche is? JAKE (ON PHONE): New Iberia. Yeah. There's an old fishing camp there. You take a left at a place called C and R's Bait and Tackle, and it's exactly 6/10 of a mile off the main road. Why don't you meet me there in two hours? [MUSIC PLAYING] Bro. This here's what you call a quandary, bro. Hey, karate man, you come to settle that insurance claim? Not unless you've got whole life. Just like I thought. You chop shop guys ain't much in close, are you? [SHOUTING] [SPLASH] Take care of him. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT]. [SPLASH] - Yo, are you the lawyer? - Why? Are you going to sue him too? Lady sports writer said you might need some help. She's given me a lot of pub. Probably got me rookie of the year. I figured I owe her. - Susan sent you? - Yeah. She's a good lady. Yeah, a damned good lady. [MUSIC PLAYING] Susan! Come on, Susan. Don't you die on me. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come back to me, child. Come on, now. No. No. No! Seen him? Charlie, I haven't even talked to him since Susan died. Jake? Jake. Oh god. [SNORING] - I'll get the coffee. - Come on. What? - You're due in court. - What? Come on, you're late for court. - OK. - Up and at 'em, baby. - OK. - Come on. - All right, I'm coming. - Get your butt in gear. All right! Susan's autopsy was by the book-- salt water in the lungs, pinkish foam in the airway. She was alive when she stepped into the pool. If she had been killed and then dumped in, the lungs would have produced the foam. It's death by drowning-- nothing to dispute. I dispute it damn it. She was a strong swimmer-- mile a day, 365 days a year. There's no way she drowned. Look again. Hey, Jake, you know, you've got an active imagination, Jake. Murder in the gulf, ambush on Bayou Teche. If you set off to Hollywood-- Your star witness murdered Susan Corrigan and set me up. The coroner said Susan Corrigan drowned. And as for you, that's not the way I hear it. Melanie Corrigan said you tried to extort her. She said you said that if she testifies, you could play that tape, and if she don't testify, you'll give her the tape. You're going to get your equipment in a wringer, Jake. Our boy's got enough to bust you for obstruction right now. Well, Remy, you got my address. Send them on over. Jake, where's the sport in that? I want to beat you fair and square. [SPEAKING FRENCH], babe. Let the good times roll. But don't worry. I'll invite you to the party. [MUSIC PLAYING] Charlie. My friends that I still have at the coroner's office, they took another look. They found a microscopic quill from a Portuguese man o' war lodged in Susan's neck. That would have paralyzed her. That explains the drowning. Portuguese man o' war? You sure? I'm sure. Kind of unusual for these waters, isn't it? Yeah, especially in a swimming pool. You're absolutely certain. Absolutamento. Dennis Lee Hardin married Miss Melanie Newton in Monroe, Louisiana, on June 12th, 1984. Five years ago, the same Miss Melanie Newton marries one Mr. Philip Corrigan on June 12th. Far as I can see, there's no record of divorce. Best I can figure, she had a fifth anniversary and wedding all on the same day. Dr. Riggs, not to steal your thunder, but you're prepared to testify for the defense that Philip Corrigan died from a spontaneous aortic aneurysm, isn't that correct? Correct. Lots of things can cause a spontaneous aortic aneurysm, right doctor? That's right-- hypertension, arteriosclerosis, syphilis, trauma. How about a huge injection of succinylcholine? Would that cause trauma to the heart? The trauma I'm referring to would be from a serious blow, like the chest hitting the steering wheel in a car crash or a vicious punch, kick, karate chop. What about the injection? That depends. You have to ask a cardiologist. That depends? That depends? - Yes. That depends. No further questions, your Honor. Hey, Charlie. Yeah. That karate blow you were talking about this afternoon-- could that really have caused Philip Corrigan's aneurysm? Yeah, but nobody can know for sure. We have a needle track, and we have an aneurysm. Maybe they're connected. Maybe they're not. Forensic medicine is not an exact science. Then we got nothing. We don't have the nurse. We don't have a smoking gun. And this is fourth quarter, and we're three touchdowns behind. We're going to have to come up with some way to create a reasonable doubt that Roger aced Phillip. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I didn't kill fill Phillip. Jake, you said you believed me. Now you're talking like I'm guilty. You're talking like I have something to hide. Roger, no. Roger. Do you want me to get you off? - Yes. Then you're going to have to give me something. You're going to have to give me Melanie. She is framing you, man. You're just sitting there posing for the picture. I am not guilty. Do you hear me? I did not kill Phillip Corrigan. Well, I guess we'll just going to have to buy some time to convince the jury of that. Objection, your Honor. Oh, come on, Remy. I'm just asking Mr. Hardin here if he can break these two little bitty blocks with one blow. That's all. Well, can you do that, Mr. Hardin? Who knows. That's irrelevant, your Honor. Uh, Mr. Savaul, this is a capital case, and I will not unduly limit the defense. But Mr. Lassiter, get to the point. Overruled. Fact is, you're not good enough to break these blocks, are you? - Are you kidding? With my hand, my foot, or my head? That's kid stuff. Oh yeah? Well, let's see you do it. Come on then. Your Honor, he's badgering the witness. Give me that book, Dijon. With the court's permission, I've got the citation right here, your honor. State of Louisiana versus men. Here it is. I know all about you and Melanie, Dennis Lee-- high school sweethearts, nice little Baptist wedding up there in Monroe. When you come down here to the big city for the big score, she shakes her booty and old Phillip Corrigan just drooled like a St. Bernard. But then Melanie got to liking Mr. Corrigan, didn't she? That old man could do stunts an old boy full of steroids just couldn't manage. That why they call you the Big Softy from the Big Easy, bro? You want me to mess you up, bubba? You got in over your head, didn't you? And so you messed up Phillip Corrigan real good, didn't you? [SCREAMING]. Bailiff. The jury shall-- The jury will-- [GAVEL BANGING] Gentlemen, my chambers right now. OK, here's the deal, boys. I'm declaring a mistrial. Oh, damn it. The jurors won't be able to ignore that business. And Mr. Lassiter, I know you provoked that action. I'm holding you in contempt. Report for sentencing tomorrow morning and bring your toothbrush. Hell of a story, Remy. The defendant goes free, and the lawyer goes to the joint. [BELLS RINGING] Well, Remy, I have to admit that's the first time I ever been bailed out by the DA. That was a nifty move, Jake, getting that mistrial declared. I had to buy some time for my clients so we could find the real doer. By the way, where are we going? Somebody wants to talk to you in my office. I'm sorry. I was so afraid. He threatened my babies. It's all right. When I read the story in the paper I knew I had to come forward. I'm sorry I put you through this, Mr. Lassiter. Jake. And it's OK. You just tell me what you saw that evening. Sometime between 10:30 and 11:00 I was walking down the hall. And I saw a muscular man and a woman leaving Mr. Corrigan's room. Did you recognize him. No, not at the time, but now I know it's the same man who threatened my babies. It's the man I saw come after you on the news and the trial. Do you know how long they were in Mr. Corrigan's room? I don't know. But it wasn't too much after that we went code blue on Mr. Corrigan. If the muscle man new how to shoot up on steroids, he certainly could inject a supine body with succinylcholine. And if Philip Corrigan fought back in his weakened condition, that would explain the aneurysm. It's like the poor SOB was killed twice. What do you think about all this, Remy? I think it sounds like good news for your client. Then why don't you let me go talk to him? [BEEPING] ANSWERING MACHINE: You've reached Roger Salisbury. I'm not in right now. If you need me, call my emergency s-- [BEEP] [TIRES SQUEALING] [TROLLEY BELL] [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] You dumb son of a-- when are you going to start thinking with your brain and not your hormones. [MUFFLED MOANING] What? I came here to find out how she killed Phillip Corrigan, Jake. Roger, the nurse came forward. You're going to walk. Not very far. Dennis Lee, they set the jailbird free. Yeah, and just imagine, you were the first people I came to see. Yeah, the last two, unless you and Doc grow gills all of a sudden. When did you start letting him talk? Don't underestimate him, Lassiter. Oh, I wouldn't dare. He's so talented. All right, let's go. I mean, just imagine, he can shoot an old man full of succinylcholine, and unless I miss my guess, he's one that helped you put that man o' war in the swimming pool. Keep it moving, bro. You know, the one that stung Susan. Yeah, that was good. Wasn't it? See that's a-- that's a salt water pool. Stand by the bay. All kinds of marine life can survive in it except the expert swimmer stung by a Portuguese man o' war. Oh, wait. This is my favorite part. When it's over, all you have to do is raise up the screams, and the murder weapon just floats out to sea. I just love the details. Don't you? Come on. Come on. [SPEAKING JAPANESE]. Bupkis. [GUN FIRING] OK? [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Dennis Lee, you are under arrest for murder, babe. You've got the right to remain silent. So just shut up. Hey, you want to fish this piece of trash out the water? Hey, Melanie, I know how much you like details. How's this one strike you-- 15 years to life. Watch your head, child. - Jake. - Not now, Roger. We'll talk later. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR STARTING] This is a cool sunrise. Yeah. Groovus extremus. And it's nice to know that one way or another, it comes up every day. Yeah. Anybody for breakfast? I know a great little Sicilian Creole place right here in the Quarter. They serve a calamari and oyster frittata. Scrambled eggs aioli-- it's to die for. What the hell? Nobody lives forever. [MUSIC PLAYING]
