He gets into fights..... comes home drunk sometimes..... ..these are the things this great man does... he has the respect that a gangster has in a village... ..even we give him that respect.. ..and your saying that he goes to college and also earns money,.. ..in reality he should have been the father of two children by now. Had his parents pulled his ears, he would have been a decent man.

But I was just a common girl, trying to strike a deal with an extremely shrewd businessman I was bound to lose. We got married. I carried out all my duties as a woman and as a wife.... but my wifely duties towards Utkarsh were like a violation for me Trying to strike a deal with Utkarsh Mehta was a trapped Sarojini Shah. And she kept her sons name Meet, to settle scores with her husband, but finally it was Meet who was at a loss What had I done... what was the fault of Meet Mehta? Meet...what is this?
