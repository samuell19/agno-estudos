Damn! Take the means against high blood pressure? Yes. What about your consumption? I only drink top wines. The question was more aimed on the quantity. Your heart valves are weak. Alcohol makes it worse. Doctor, wine is not alcohol. I have checked it. Apparently it is. Yes but... - No. Even if the label says "Médoc", it's not medicine. I am a wine merchant. I drink wine professionally. if it bothers you change jobs. We need a greengrocer. Selling carrots and broccoli? - Why not? You can't be serious. - You don't take it seriously enough. Today's incident was a very serious warning. If my practice weren't nearby, God knows what could have happened. You can't go on like this. This colleague can help you. Fine, but I'm not going. The body of Christ. - Amen. The body of Christ. - Amen. My daughter. The blood of Christ. But it's good! Too bad you Sundays don't want to cook anymore. Mom, you never liked it. Too salty, too sweet, too this, too that... Well, you never are been a great cook. The homeless like it. - Great recommendation. Amaury never complimented you made for your cooking skills. Stop it, that wasn't the problem. You have to look ahead. It's been four years. I know that, thanks I am just worried. Life is short. You're not the youngest anymore. I only want what is best for you. I'm leaving now. I am tired. No, you haven't eaten anything yet. I'm not hungry. We wanted to play scrabble. scrabble 50 bonus points. 68. Do you write it down? Bravo! Well played. But I'm not done yet. I also wanted to get a shot. I beg your pardon? Good day. - Good day. What's that good for? The state helps young people. Nobody hires them. There are certainly reasons for this. Yes, but if you no one gives a chance they never make it. I can not take care of a social case. We need a solution. I'm not talking about bankruptcy. It's not that far yet, but soon. So I'll be back soon. Think about it. I will do that. Goodbye. madam Yes? What do you wish? A very good bottle of wine but i have no idea. Well, wine comes in three colors: Red, white and rose. I know that much. But I am not sure. Red or white? is it for dinner - Yes, that's exactly right. Dinner or lunch, it was 50:50. Or do you drink a glass with breakfast? I try to avoid it. - I also. I'll try it. Do you know what to eat? It will probably be meat. Or fish. All right then... Have you lately drank a good wine? no Yet! On the last Sunday, the altar wine my pastor for communion. He was delicious. A plan by the Vatican to fill the churches? That could be. I can ask him about the wine. i have his number Very nice. We are saved. If you have no transcendental answer to receive your SMS, take this Cigalus, generous and aromatic, very balanced. Or maybe this château l'Hospitalet, rounded and full-bodied, with flavors of spices and red fruits. Is biodynamic good? Organic cultivation without pesticides. no matter how much you drink You don't get a hangover. Yes this is good. Is the best selling point. Everyone doesn't care about the environment, but everyone would like to be able to drink twice as much. Which one should I take now? Try this one. A bottle is open. It's still early. It's good anytime. I'll keep you company too. But just a drop. Do you organize wine tastings? Hardly any at the moment. That's a pity. - Maybe I'll start again. "Get high. To avoid the tormented slaves the time to be get intoxicated intoxicate you endlessly. With wine, with poetry or with virtue, with what you want." Charles Baudelaire. Thanks. He is good. Very delicious. Father Benoît writes: a Nuits Saint Georges 2015. He's having a good time. I have one somewhere from 2017, that was a good year too. Somewhere, but where? Here. You're welcome. 55 euros. But that much? - The collection must be well filled. A gift, no doubt. Father Benoît lives modestly. Good day. - Good day. So the Nuits Saint Georges? - What the heck, let's have a blast. your PIN. The wine should make a good impression. Should it be a gift? He's for a weekly dinner for homeless people. But then spoil them. Welcome to the world, you little miracle what a darling You're so pretty. Very beautiful. yes you look at me My little darling. may i have it back Yes of course. Careful. Really delicious. I shouldn't have mixed it up. I like it. - Will you give me the bread? I have a surprise for you. What a? - A top wine. A Nuits Saint Georges 2017. Already open? - Yes, he needs to breathe. She has already tasted. - That's some wine. just one sip so that it is enough for everyone. I would also like to. - I also. Like the Chevalier de Saint Georges. - I agree. Drink up first. - You can mix that. No, you don't mix that. In the body it mixes anyway. - Is correct. Where is he from? - Metro Saint Georges. Wine doesn't grow in Paris. - In Montmartre. In Montmartre? - Yes, that's well known. Wine growing in the city? What a crap. You wanted a good wine. - That would be pearls before swine. No, what nonsense. Come on. Roger, please. For my sake. I don't want me get used to good wine. A small sip. I'll gladly take his. Drink up first. Well then. We will try? Quite ok. - He is good!

There is dessert. - What is that? Tiramisu. - Brilliant. Forgiveness. - Yes? i am looking for dr Valensi. This is me. Are you Jacques Dennemont? Yes. - Welcome. I thought it was a one-on-one appointment. I don't have that. You sit down. No fear. No I am not afraid. Good day. - But no, thanks. It's hot now. Nini! Nini, I'm back. Nini. Did you have a nice day? are you alright Should I call a doctor? No need. I know what he's gonna say. Today we welcome Jacques. Hello Jacques. I'm not an alcoholic. I've got a heart problem and must drink no more wine. We take care of such things here. Yes, but I can easily abstain from alcohol for three days. When did you have that made for the last time? The last time... I do not know that anymore. Can you then say that you drink every day? Yes, maybe, but only wine. I don't drink hard alcohol. How many glasses of wine a day? I never counted Two glasses? Three? four glasses? It can be a bottle. Or even more. I mean, I'm a wine merchant. That's why I only drink very good wines. organic wines. But you are here today because you want to stop I do not have another choice. My doctor says I would die otherwise. Here is the right place. To die? no To live. it doesn't excite me set up a social case. Employers are often very satisfied. Who can you offer me? - I made a preselection. Jordan, 23, an ex-drug addict, who is doing much better now. Who else? Then there would be Zora, paraplegic after an accident. Highly motivated. There is a wheelchair in my shop absolutely impossible. Your coffee, please. Thanks. A glass of white wine with that? - No. For real? - Not today. OK. Steve rejected all foster homes. He is currently living in a home. Or you sell the Château Margaux from the safe. The high price would reassure the tax office. As I said, I will never sell him. Well so what. Good day. - Good day. Thank you for your advice. The homeless loved it. Yes, that was no surprise. Bid again now wine tasting? Yes, of couse. I just have to organize it. All right, I'll stop by the store then. goodbye - Goodbye. Let's focus. Where were we? Here's the file. - What is that? The state has financial and moral duties, but Steve also commits. Please. - What does that mean? When he misses work do you have to tell me I'm neither a snitch nor a watchdog. No, but his boss from now on. And the tax break? Always at the end of the month if everything goes right. Goodbye, Monsieur Dennemont. steve Goodbye. All right then, You have two important tasks here. They fill up the shelves but mainly tidy and clean the store. Clean it all up? - Is this a problem? No, I'll clean everything up. But it would be best for you when I take care of the customers. i can talk a lot - Yes, it seems so. But knowledge of wine you can't improvise. I've drunk wine many times. - Sleight of hand. So you have no alcohol ban For religious reasons? No, I respect all religions but I don't practice any. OK. What do you know about wine? Wine on beer, I advise you. Yes, that's a start. beer on wine... - Stop it. yes but it is a bit more complicated. And champagne is for celebration. Where does champagne come from In her opinion? From Saint Tropez. - There's still a lot missing. First of all clear it all up. Throw away the empty boxes. - Cool. I would like to do this but i have claustrophobia. I feel bad in basements. It's already tingling. Are you serious? - I swear basements scare me. There is everything. mice, bats, Rats, raccoons... raccoons? Why not just beavers? This basement is clean. That's clear a task for professionals. I can't pay anyone. Either clean up or your internship ends now. Good day. - Good day. Good day. Steve, keep cleaning out the basement if there aren't too many raccoons. Naturally. I do to strengthen a cigarette break, then it starts. Madame, I already have back pain from these boxes. The joys of incorporation. I think it's great, to promote something like that. I'm not so sure about that. Can I help you? I wanted me Sign up for a wine tasting. Oh yes. - If there's one soon. We will see... So... Is your calendar from 2005? I recycle. I change the dates and days manually. - How clever. I can next Friday do a wine tasting. I have time on Friday but it's a holiday. Oh yes. - Maybe not in 2005. But in 2021 already. - As a matter of fact. How about Wednesday? - I have to go to the African dance. Then maybe on Thursday? I have a choir rehearsal but I can skip them. Very good. Can you give me write down your number? Then I can confirm it. I'll buy another bottle of wine. - The same as last time? No, the wine doesn't have to be that good. It's for my mother. Here. It's very good. He's on sale. Two for 20 euros. - Then I'll keep one for myself. If I give her both she ends up in a terrible state. Wait. If the second is for you take this one. Yes, but is it also on sale? No, it's much more expensive. I'll forgive you the difference. - I'm uncomfortable with that. It doesn't have to be. That's called customer loyalty. Is she gone? She forgot her phone. yes she is gone Your tobacco smells like marijuana. I know this is weird. I don't understand that either. Please help me still cleaning up? I'll help you. I give everything you give it your all? In earnest? Every little task takes hours. I just work carefully. Wine is precious. Too bad. if it were faster could you help me with the customers. In the end it's just the mop again. - Is that degrading? I mop too. I know people who do just that. That's not for me. Good, that's enough for today. You can go. Tell me, isn't it time for an aperitif? Yes, but I'm sticking with water today. are you kidding me - No. That's no fun. - I'm not a joker. Good evening. - We're closed. You have your whole life on your cell phone. that she forgets about you has something to say. No, she was only with their minds elsewhere. What is she like? Very catholic. She is pretty? - She has potential. Despite a hair band and a pleated skirt? I didn't say that she is Bernadette Chirac. She will come back to pick it up. You need to up a gear, buddy. I don't shift at all. - Fear of defeat? No, I don't care about the woman at all. I'll leave the praying sister to you. - No thanks. I have too many cases in the waiting line. He is good. I don't sleep well. I wake up drenched in sweat and trembling up. full of fears and with knots in the stomach. It's an Addiction. That's physiological. By getting used to it the body craves alcohol. At any hour, day or night. We've all experienced that. They also? For me it was postage. I didn't feel to be an alcoholic but I drank Porto in the morning. But you didn't relapse? No, I'll hold on. But I give on Thursday a wine tasting. I will have to taste the wines. I spit them out, of course, but... It's going to be pure torture. That's with me. Yes? Yes I have it, otherwise I couldn't answer. Thanks. I thought, I would have lost it again. You haven't missed anything. I beg your pardon? Until you call it didn't ring. Neither during the day nor in the evening. No call came this morning either. All the better. I have seen, that no SMS or messages came. Sometimes it keeps ringing and sometimes it's much quieter. Not with you? For me it is sometimes continuously calm. O Sidney Bechet! Yes, this is for decoration. For the atmosphere. - I love him. Good day. - Good day. So is the wine tasting taking place? yes on thursday So until Thursday... hortense Call me Hortense. I'm Jacques See you Thursday, Jacques. Lay them flat. Tell me, are you okay? It's okay, I saw through you. No, no one sees through me. i am like fog And the wine I'm also often foggy. Foggy, foggy... That doesn't work. Come on, clean up finished the basement. "Hortense." "Call me Hortense." "I'm Jacques." That's enough now! Did you see the code? - No. There's nothing to steal anyway. - Calm down. Keep it up! And breathe. I press to help you. Keep breathing. You do it wonderfully. I press with you. breathe So yes! Yes, the baby is here. The baby is here. Here it is. There's the baby. There it is. The baby is here. Do you feel like this every time? may i have him Yes. I feel so ridiculous. I have to change jobs. This is too hard. I'm going to a wine tasting tonight. Are you coming? I'm sorry I can not. But go anyway. That'll do you good. Good day. The blue shirt, please. Good evening! Good evening. - Am I too late? No, right on time. Give me the coat. Some canceled so it will be a small round. Only one person comes. I'll give you a check. - There's no hurry. Later I find it difficult to write. It's a wine tasting, not a booze. - I get tipsy easily. I am excited. - Good evening. Hortense, this is Guillaume. From the bookstore next door. - Am I disrupting? No not at all. Guillaume, this is Hortense. Very pleased, mademoiselle. - madam. Without a wedding ring, I say "Mademoiselle". Nobody says that anymore. Yes, it was abolished in 2012. I know, but I think it's a shame. Shall we start with the wine tasting? That's all? Yes, you try and then spit it out. Into the spittoon. Steve, you spit out the wine. Yes, but my mouth tasted funny. Then it's good. Nothing should mask the taste. For real? A mint. Better late than never. Want to get rid of mucus? No thanks. Not necessary. All right then. Everyone can take their glass now. I'll explain how it works. Shit, I didn't spit! Steve, listen otherwise we'll never make it. They don't try until I say so. I'm fast. Apparently especially when drinking. Is not a reproach. It's just how it works for me too. So, a wine tasting always takes place in three steps. First the visual aspect. You look at the wine. Then the olfactory dimension. You smell the wine. And only then do you try it. Like a woman. Not really, no. So, first phase: Look closely at the wine. First: the shine. The stronger the shine the higher the acidity. It's very shiny, isn't it? He has a nice glow. That makes you want it. Yes, but be patient. Then the intensity. the darker the wine the more intense it is. Finally the color. A young white wine has green reflections. With age, they turn golden. This one is not very old. I agree. A good eye, Hortense. Beautiful eyes too. He attacks head on. Can we focus on the wine? And now let's smell it. Don't pan. This is called "the first nose". And off. When the wine is open it releases many aromas. a closed wine, which is still ripe hardly smells. hydrangea? - I hardly smell anything. Perfume can be a problem. Have I applied too much? - I did not say that. It smells good, very fresh. And he follows up. Smell the wine, not me. - It's not mutually exclusive. Now let's swing it so that it can take in oxygen. And we smell a second time. Usually a little stronger. i smell vanilla No not at all. - Not? no hydrangea? Musk. Like a deodorant for men. Maybe you are Guillaume got too close. Well, he got closer to me. Deodorant? No way, I only wear perfume. That smells like the grapefruits from the canteen, with tons of sugar. I agree. - Yes, grapefruit! Yes, a touch of citrus. Doesn't it smell like pebbles too? Pebble? Why not gravel? He's right. It has a mineral note. It grows on limestone soils. Your sense of smell is great. I have a good nose. Nobody sells me bad weed. Fantastic! Good. Now we can taste it. You take a small sip and keeps it in your mouth. That first impression is called an "attack". Well then, attack! You started yours a long time ago. you can drink it if you want to. We have a choice? - By general request. Let's go. Just a little sip. Pan it over the tongue and gums. You can also breathe in through your mouth and breathe out through your nose. This retro olfactory action revealed new aspects of taste. So. Anyone wanna spit? - Would be a pity. I swallow. I mean in my upbringing spitting was considered improper. For me it's not the upbringing I just want to get drunk. Good, thanks for these comments. What are your impressions? First of all, I found it very good. Can you be more specific? The longer he touched my tongue the fuller it got. I could feel him moving spread in my mouth. OK. Any comment Steve? He had a taste... of fruits and flowers. Yes I would say a note of white flowers and Vineyard Peaches. What was the overall impression? We'd like another glass. We have other bottles to try. This one definitely was a Pouilly Fuisse 2015. Grape variety Chardonnay. Under the tongue. Swish around in the mouth. This one had many flavors during the attack. And maybe a hint of vanilla. No not at all. I would say, it tastes like an epiphany cake. True, now that you say it I taste the almond note too. You have a fine palate. - I am an enchanted prince. Let's move on. This is a Bordeaux. - A burgundy. Yes, of course, a burgundy. And it has nothing to do with almonds. - No. Unlike Hortense's eyes. They are almond shaped. I don't think so, no. Sets the wannabe Casanova never a break? I beg your pardon? - What's the problem, Jacques Dessange? What did the snotty nose say? - Did he call me snotty-nosed? Steve! - Who's he calling snotty-nosed? Chill out. - Say that again. It's already late, You have to go back home. I'm going. Jerk! What did he say? Yes, sleep well Steve! He called me snotty-nosed! Yes, that's what they say to little kids. It's more of a nice thing. No, that means that you have snot in your nose. I'll smack that bastard in the face! Midwife? So you see babies all day. That's the principle. And you? Do you have children? You are quite curious. - That means no. Otherwise I would already know their names their age and how many there are. Am I asking you questions? All right, where were we? Yes, well, that was a Haut-Brion. A Grand Cru Classe. I'm going, Jacques, it's better that way. For real? - No, I'll go. Then everyone goes. ok - It's all ok. I just slipped. Because of the heels. I slipped away It would be nice to do a wine tasting could do for the homeless. You would be receptive to it. - Yes why not? See you then, Jacques. Well then, Jacques... Goodbye. Do you want me to take you with me? There's room for two. That's nice, but I prefer to run. Too bad. Bye. Ouch Everything okay? ok - Yes, it was just the curve. I went too far. Are you sure? Be careful! I forgot my scarf. Sorry. I always forget something. That's a good thing i forgot your gift There is a gift? - Always. To keep practicing at home. Yes this is important. - Fundamental. A rosé from the Rhone Valley. "Foreplay?" Yes, you drink it with an aperitif. Logical. There is also a bottle of red wine. "Petite fleur" like the song. Yes indeed. shall we listen? - Why not? do you dance - Very bad. We don't care. Then I'll go. Lots of labels coming off in the basement because of the humidity. Have you ever thought Labels of expensive wines to stick on cheap bottles? No, I don't do that. Honestly, nobody would notice. But I. And you too, by the way. You were at the wine tasting yesterday by far the best. For real? - Yes. It was very spontaneous. I agree. You have a good nose and a good palate. Is it still late? All are 10 minutes gone after you. Then you didn't get to the train? Then you absolutely have to organize a wine tasting. Bring this box to Dr. Milmont. It is not far. Holy shit. Damn. Crap! Wanker! Where's my scooter? In front of the store but well chained. You don't use it at all? That didn't work with the box. By the way, here. A gift for borrowing. I do not drink. Sell it expensive online. Does this say "classifieds"? I place the ad. Farewell to money worries. You don't switch anything. bring him to me otherwise your mother won't recognize you. She never did, asshole! I don't give a fuck. My scooter, or you're dead! leave her here Fuck off. He's totally crazy. The grapes are pressed and the juice will collected in these containers, for a first fermentation of about 20 days. In the process, it transforms the sugar in alcohol. Interesting, but shall we try? It's planned, don't worry. That's a lot of wine. In this room stands a very old wine press from the late 18th century. This is a so-called Radkelter. I'll show you why in a moment. Do you see this wheel? That's how it was run. That's how it is done. - Is it still working? Yes, you can try the press. - But just no pressure. Yes. The wine matures in these barrels. Here he can age more or less, depending on the vintage. Is the wood quality important? Yes, but not so much like the quality of the harvest. Wine is said to have originated around 8000 BC somewhere in Armenia. It was certainly a coincidence. Wild Grapes fermented after picking, people drank the juice and found it delicious. No shit. Yes, it is understandable. Winemaking was successful through advances in agriculture and the invention of pottery, for storage. Natural fermentation was explored. So that was wine then a sign of civilization. We are still today very civilized. I haven't waited 8000 years. My mother gave me as a baby put wine in the bottle. This is true. - With your visage one believes it. What? - Listen to Jacques. Let's get to practice. Take your glasses. Swirl the wine before you smell it. Hold it under your nose. Good this way. - That doesn't smell like anything. Roger's stench spoils it. It's you who stinks. you can drink it If you want. Nice and slow. Oh well... A heavyweight. - Yes, it's rich. May we refill? - As they want. Roger, don't be greedy. Bring it on. me too - Roger, I want something too. "Roger, Roger..." Thank you Hortense. I was surprised, that you call so soon and me this suggestion do for today. I had agreed. And the winemaker is a friend. It was easy for me. It's mostly very nice. Do you mind taking me with you? In the minibus we were like sardines. No not at all. Do you still have time afterwards? Unfortunately not tonight. Do you have an appointment? - Yes, exactly. What a pity. I have a surprise as a thank you. i have tickets for a world music festival at 9 p.m. Unfortunately I can't. That's not bad. I have the cards so I go anyway. Can not you invite someone else? I don't really want to to invite someone else would you like coffee - I won't say no to that. Or did you happen to japanese green tea? No, but I have French red wine. No, I prefer coffee. I'm all about you. I shouldn't say that because it might go to your head but i really had a beautiful night. All right, have a nice day then. You also. They must have had a good tasting. That's enough Steve. I swear this is totally cool. So see you soon then. Yes. - Goodbye. You did well. I said from the start that you fall in love. So never? Yes, once. Thanks. But the groom has the wedding canceled a week before. Such a crap. Forgiveness. Thanks. Did he have a good reason? - He changed his mind. That is a good reason. The best, right. But imagine the chaos. The guests, the caterer, the pastor... Everyone hates last minute cancellations. And have you ever been married? Yes, a long time ago What happened? - The usual. She left me for someone else. It's easier without children. You don't drink at all. So I still drink the whole bottle. Do you wanna get me drunk and take it with you? Why not? No, that will not be possible. We're going to my place tonight. OK. It's stupid to say but i feel like i've known you forever Oh really? - Got it. So am I getting lost in something? - No. may i say that I'm comfortable with you? Yes, you can say that. And it's mutual. Do you want to make me happy with that? - No. I'm glad you're mine don't just want to make someone happy. I can't quite keep up with that. Is not bad. I'll be right back. At the end of the hallway. Left, right, left. Thanks. Right left... The other left. Excuse me. - It's okay. No, it's just because I never know where is right and left. It's a good time. i need to talk to you about this I'll be leaving again soon to a clinic in Maradès, Spain. For a new IVF attempt. Okay to have a baby alone? Exactly like in the song. I decided that because my love life years ago stuck in a dead end. And I really want a child before it is too late. That may seem selfish crazy, morally dubious... everyone has an opinion but for me it is essential. Do you find that pathetic? It's not very Catholic. - I know. I have my pastor of course not said. Neither did my mother. She is very religious. Why not in France? It is now allowed. The ova are in Spain. It would take too much time and money to change everything. This means... you turn to a Spanish sperm bank? Do you have anything against spanish sperm? - No, on the contrary. What does the opposite mean? I have no idea. I don't know with "los spermatozoidos". It's called "espermatozoides". Perfect. Why are you asking about it? Do you want to replace the dispenser? No, absolutely not. - Sorry, that was wrong. That would be premature. - Yes of course. Excuse me. I'm talking nonsense. I never met the right person. So I rush things. Yes, that's going a bit too fast. Yes, but at my age the clock is ticking. It hangs over me like a sword of Damocles. I dream of having a child. A little boy or a little girl. And even though it was just the two of us she or he and I, we would be a small family But I know, that a relationship with a woman that can be artificially inseminated is not exactly ideal. I have to open the shop. won't you say anything There is nothing to say. It's your life, your decision. I respect that. Don't worry. Bye. - Bye. Do you see the streaks on the glass? Yes. This is called the tears of wine. They reflect his soul. As if wine had a soul. He comes to hell or to heaven? the more tears the higher the alcohol content. Logically, the sadder you are, the more you want to drink. Another tasting? Won't you answer? - Am I interfering with you? Sorry. Good day. - Good day doctor. Nice to see, for taking my advice. When life is too gray something red is good. I would have recommended something green. Have a glass with me. - No thanks. Are you sure? - For real. A Haut Brion. But just a small sip. So perfect. Wonderful. Not that I'm worried but I have the ordered wine case do not get. I delivered them and parked at the entrance. At the entrance? In the street? - I was afraid to go in. Doctors always could detect an illness. I can put your mind at ease. We do not examine every supplier. That's why you ask Wine for 300 euros on the street? I took the risk. A risk that falls back on me. Glad I still have a box. We'll deliver them tonight. That's nice Jacques but I'll take them with me. I prefer it like this. Goodbye gentlemen. - Goodbye. A good choice. why don't you answer the phone I left many messages. Sorry. I wanted to call you back. Tell me if you are against IVF. I do not even know, whether I'm for it or against it. I just need a little time to process it all. Understood. You will disappear without a trace. No not at all. Nothing should change. That is not easy. Let's look for a solution where hardly anything changes. It's uncertain whether the fertilization works. you don't go so that she fails. Don't you like children? I just can't take care of her. I don't ask for that either. You would not be a father or stepfather and you wouldn't have to live with me I ask nothing of you. I just don't want that we separate. Does it scare you? - What should I be afraid of? Good day. - Good day. I'm sorry, I have to work now. Yes of course. Then I'll go. Will you call me? - This evening. Promised. No joke, no comment. No new messages. Main menu. To change your... This is Jacques. leave a message. I'll call you back. Listen, don't bother to call me. Leave it, I understand. I didn't know you were leaving on the 15th. I have told you several times. you leave me again a whole Sunday alone. It's a midwifery seminar. I have to go there. But why are you doing this in Spain? In Spain was artificial insemination First legal across the EU. That wasn't a good performance. Mom, stop it. it seems normal to you you also perform abortions. women have the right to control their body regardless of social rank. Unwanted pregnancies suck. You're 40 years behind. Were the laws already been like this 40 years ago, maybe you wouldn't exist Are you now for or against abortion? you told me too many times that I was an accident who expelled dad. But he's gone because you are unbearable! you criticize everything and you're never satisfied. I wanted to bring you joy but you don't even know what that is. You're pissed like an old cucumber! Is the nervous crisis over? Yes, it's over. Let's play Scrabble. Mummy? I'll stay with you for dinner. i have my fridge emptied before the trip. Caution hot. Mummy? Mummy. Mom, please wake up. Mom, please wake up! Mummy! Mom, please wake up. Hello? Hello? Yes. My mother... She passed out. Yes. Yes. we have done everything to save her, but it was too late. Here, the death certificate. She had some Scrabble letters in the hand. Here you are. She loved Scrabble. Are you okay? Goodbye. Danièle was a very generous one and kind woman. no one could foresee that the Lord is calling them so early. And now you can say goodbye or leave a rose Did she believe in paradise? - Yes. For her so the best is yet to come. Have courage. Thanks for coming. It means a lot to me. Did you postpone the clinic thing? Yes, that was emotionally too much.

I will be there every step of the way. I am behind you. You're so adorable. What is? Is something wrong? Yes, everything is okay. You shouldn't be working today.

It goes without saying. Did you want to tell me something specific?

Can I help you? - Yes, perhaps. excuse the question but I can't ask anyone else. He's a widower, right? I can't say anything about that. - I know, but he's so weird. With every question he closes himself off. That with us must not be over already. The local press reported about it at the time. So it's no secret. Jacques suffered a tragedy. About 15 years ago. He brought his son back from his in-laws. He drove all night. Without a break to the store to be able to open punctually in the morning. Around six in the morning the sun rose And 30 kilometers from here, when he was almost home he fell asleep at the wheel. Jacques had three broken ribs but his son... He was thrown out of the child seat and was dead instantly. His marriage never recovered from this. She met another man and moved back south. Broilly 2016. - Unbelievable. Broilly 2016. Again or a different wine? Another. She dares a rose to lay on my son's grave? Are you sure it was her? - Of course it was her. Then it wasn't to hurt you. On the contrary. - Did you tell her something? no What do you think? Am I interfering in her life? She's just in love with you. Nonsense, she wants to pin a child on me. No, she will have her child all by herself. I can't take care of a child. I can't even look at children. So you never want to see her again? Jacques... Damn what happened? talk to me Come on Jacques! Do not give up. Stay with us! Can you hear me? Open your eyes. The cardiologist said You can go home. Do you have pain? No, everything is OK. But meanwhile the pain was terrible. Apparently it really hurts. I really thought that was it. One thing is certain: I'll never drink a drop again. That's good news for your heart valves. Your heart is beating normally. It's good. Do you want to hear? - What for? Just to try it out. It knocks fast. That is normal. You have a fast pulse. Fine, I'll get you then off this afternoon. yes ok thank you Wait. your stethoscope. Keep it, it's a gift. - Thanks, I don't need it. Yet. Listen to your heart more often. This is a Chablis who stole his flavors from the succulent, sun-drenched grapes along the famous Canal du Midi. Not the Canal de Bourgogne? That's unimportant. All rivers flow into the sea. Not in the same sea, but why not? I take him. Come. You will not regret it. Do you pay by card? - Yes, please. Good you can. I'll give you a bag. - Thanks. May I help you. - Thanks. Goodbye. How's it going, brother? Everything cool. Isn't your boss there? - No, but he'll be right there. This is how you can pay for the scooter. Forget it, the register is empty. Oh yes? Then you will find another solution. Don't worry brother. It just takes time. OK, it takes time. What shoud that? stop what are you doing Can not you see that? Stop doing that! I'm clumsy when i get fooled Goodbye. Thanks. What's going on here? no That can not be true. Damn. The little bastard has stole my bottle of Château Margaux! Put that into perspective. The important thing is that you feel better. I don't want to relativize anything. That's how this ass thanks you for my help? Chill out, before your heart stops. You sit down. give me your wrist Her pulse is racing again. This is not good. breathe - Yes, I breathe. Chill out. Do not forget, that he saved your life. You know I have a bottle of Chateau Margaux. An exceptional vintage. 1959 For real? One day when we are very old let's drink them together. A small glass... Chateau Margaux. So now is the pulse already much slower. What year was yours from? From Maxime's birth year. I'm sorry. I promised my doctor to stay calm so I stick to it. But that the Château Margaux is missing, is unacceptable. It hurts my soul. He was so motivated. He wanted an education make a sommelier. Did he tell you about it? - No. Do you report theft? With a criminal record it's gonna be hard to finance his education. Good day. - Good day. I'm sure you'd like to beat me up. - I agree. I'm sorry about the store. But I have good news to your Château Margaux. I have the label glued to a cheap bottle. I gave it to Kevin. Moment. Then where's my bottle? In your basement, just untagged. A label is no big deal. Yet. Now I can never sell them. You can drink them. The wine retains its taste. Well played. shall we play a game? You want an education make a sommelier? That is what I said, so i can stay here so that she thinks that my internship brought something. You sure could make it. And be the best wine taster? Sommelier is a nice job. you have skills that you don't notice. No, I don't notice anything. You're going to file a complaint anyway. Who says I do this? Nobody will want me there. There is no such world. Yes, if you believe in it. Yes, fine, I'll stop with the moral sermon. They think, "Who does he think he is? He's not my father." Good evening. good evening Nice to see you. I was near and thought I'll bring a bottle over. Top. - But this is nice. He should be good. - Let's taste it. But first he needs to breathe. That's really nice. - Thanks. What about Hortense? Is she still in Spain? I dont know. We neither. She should be back by now. Do you eat with me? Then we toast. - No, I have to go, thanks. Too bad. - Have a nice evening. Goodbye. - Good evening, Jacques. Jacques? Hello Hortense. Hello. Do I bother you? No, I'm listening. It's nothing, I... I just wanted to know how you are. Oh well, okay. I'm fine thank you. I wanted to apologize too. For the coffee shop thing the other day. Thanks, it's alright that is in the past. No, I'm really sorry. We don't have each other met at the right time. That's correct, it wasn't the right time. I heard "Petite fleur" and... I had to think of you. Wait, I'll turn it up a little bit. Where are you now? I'm waiting for you. How are you waiting for me? I'm down Below?
