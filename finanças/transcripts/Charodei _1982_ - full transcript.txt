Listen to that! The sound of our products. Well, what is it? Well.. Happy New Year, Pyotr Petrovich. I came to say bye. Really? I'm not planning on saying goodbyes in the middle of the working day. But I've told you: I've handed the notice already, my fiancee is arriving from Kitezhgrad. Kitezhgrad? Never heard of it. You know, Kitezhgrad... - It's a town. They've raised it from underwater not long ago. - From underwater? - Your fiancee, is she beautiful? - Of course! - Who is she? - A wizard, you can say a witch. A fiancee and a witch already? Oh no. It's her line of work. Magic in the service sector. You're a courageous man, Puhov Ivan Sergeyevich. - Why is that? - A wife who's a witch... That's, you know... - All right, congratulations. - Thank you. The things they come up with to leave work early before the holidays. Wizards! THE WlZARDS A mage has power over day and night And even over planets You are a powerful wizard But at the same powerless You can create light in the dark And slice a mountain in two But you cannot order your heart You cannot order your heart To fall in love Perhaps that magic of yours Has an answer to everything To the mystery of life And immortality You might get a hold of The Philosopher's Stone But you cannot order your heart You cannot order your heart To fall in love No better game exists And after the world's been unraveled You will create new worlds You will one day You can be anywhere And be anyone But you cannot order your heart You cannot order your heart To fall in love! KlTEZHGRAD Stop at passengers' request WOWII! World-of-Wonders lnstitute for lncredible Services Wow-wee! The people that must be working here! The questions they must be dealing with! Who put this question mark here? It was in the storeroom with all the other letters. Take the question down. Happy New Year? WOW! All questions must be raised appropriately, in a timely manner. This one - on that wall. "What is your contribution to science!" Read it later, hurry up. They'll start appearing soon. They're ticking, dears. Excellent! Today or never! I place the MW trials exactly at 10. All academic council members must be there. - Do we invite the wise cat? - Where is the cat translator? I'm here, he's here. - Has the cat started talking? - He's trying and making progress. Second year I hear this. We put the cat on the council so he could practice. But he's lazy, people! That's no way to behave! We treasure your attitude. All institutes in our field have talking animals: donkeys, chimps, parrots, at the end of the day. - But he's not a parrot! - You have three days. Start talking in two days, kitty. Come to me in two days. Now! I draw your attention to the, so to say, MW's design. It must reflect its contents, but without too much focus. Contained... Simple, but tasteful. Ivan Stepanovich, as my research deputy, I ask you to help Alyona Sanina. Excuse me, we need to talk. Time to talk. That's no good. Don't be so obstinate, talk. 2 days! Come to me later. Kira, I need to talk to you. Right here? Come to my office. No, there are phones everywhere, can't stand the sight of them. Written request "For the seventh time I persuasively ask you to be my wife." "For the seventh time I agree. When I have the time." - Is that all? - No. - What do you want? - Certainty. Wedding notices handed in, wedding rings, everything that normal people have. Today is a very important day, you know it. All your days are important. You have an important position. Fine. As soon as the trials are over. - So, tomorrow? - Yes. - Promise? - If all goes well. Alyona Igorevna, where are you going! Let me congratulate you. - The trials will go well. - I hope so. May I ask you out to lunch together? Just a friendly lunch for two, with champaign. I'm not having lunch today. Diet! A diet! What a woman! Truly a ravishing beauty, a dream! One must take care of her! Please, accept this - for your lunch with the lady. And this, too. What's all this? Who are you? I'm a guest, a special guest. A guest from the sunny South, with an order. You don't look in order for the local climate. Why not? Listen, look. Stamped five times! Five! Look! "An order for one Magic Wand." For the whole sunny South! Is that asking too much? You're early, comrade, there's no Magic Wand yet. No wand? But how? The Magic Wand is not ready yet. They are working on its design, see? Magic Wood Shop No entry! Creative search in progress! Maybe, you threw it up there? Where's the drawing? - Alyona didn't leave anything. - Alyona couldn't have done that. Must have been in a hurry. Where to? She's at work. Made a flaming sign with her little finger, and was gone. So she did leave it. Couldn't you have saved it? I can't do that, Vitya. I am not a mage. And turning water into wine worth of your entire salary? That you can do. Reproaching me again with that? When was the last time I did it? Alright, fine. Something must be done. Maybe, invent it ourselves? - Don't, Vitya. - You're in the way. Don't tease our superiors. - Want me to look for Alyona? - Sit here. Sit! Detective. I'll find her myself. - Hello? - Alyona, my love! Fly out today, I can't stand being without you. Of course, my dear. Why are you sitting and not working? Where's Sanina? Where's Kovrov? I'm waiting for them. "Kostya plus Lyusya..." "Equals lov". - What's this? - An oak. Well, definitely not a Christmas tree. The question was: who are these Kostya plus Lyusya? I don't know, they came with the delivery. Find out who these individuals were, and penalise them for damaging the wood. Apollon Mitrofanovich, the wood is quite old. Perhaps these Kostya and Lyusya are not even alive anymore. Penalise them posthumously. And now, to work. You will design the form under my personal supervision. Form nowadays is attached to great... contents. You can begin. With the oak. - Have you seen Sanina? - No. - Have you seen Alyona? - No, I haven't. Where can she be? I see all your freckles. What freckles? They're gone. - Gone? Where? - Till spring. Till spring? - I'll keep them all winter. - Why? Your time is up. But I haven't told you the main thing! She doesn't want to extend the call. Hello! Alyona! Lady, I know you like music. We'll sing you a song. If you like it you'll extend the call. - Don't put down the receiver! - And if I don't like it? - Then no extension! All together now! Guys, help. Begin! We may be far, Far from each other, It's just a few words That we can exchange, But if there is love at first sight, Why can't there be love at first word? Love's like a forest fire - all it needs is a spark. It flares up from one word And eclipses the sun. It bursts in, like a wave, don't try to resist it, all it needs is one tone to flare up to the skies. To flare up to the skies. Love knows no restrictions, No boundaries, It can warm any heart. If people decide to tie the knot in letters, They can do it by phone as well. Love's like a forest fire - all it needs is a spark. It flares up from one word And eclipses the sun. It bursts in, like a wave, don't try to resist it, All it needs is a tone To flare up to the skies, To flare up to the skies. It's for you to decide what will follow. It may look a bit like a joke, But even if we are joking, This joke may Start something new. Love is like a forest fire - all it needs is a spark. It flares up from one word And eclipses the sun. It bursts in, like a wave, don't try to resist it, All it needs is a tone To flare up to the skies, To flare up to the skies. Lady! You can continue talking! I forgot to tell you the main thing. They gave us an apartment! Why didn't you tell me right away, silly? Sorry, I can't talk right now. - Good day. - Excuse me. Good day, Kira Anatolyevna, excuse me. - Alright, let's start. - Here, finally. I always take the rap for you. - What's this? - MW - the Magic Wand. - Your idea? - Are you kidding?! Supervised by Satananeyev. What a numskull! Mark my word: this numskull will cause a big stir. So, whose creation is this? Yes, I wonder. Ivan Stepanovich, help out. - So, whose creation is this? - Revolting! lnteresting design. - You think? - Why not? Democratic. - Convenient. - Very nice! Frankly, I expected something a bit more elegant. - But if there are no objections... - No objections. - What objections! The design is accepted. Let us test the contents. All we have to do is make a wish. Alyona Igorevna, take the floor. Make a wish. What's the matter, Alyona? Just wish for the most wonderful thing in the world. A month-long vacation starting today. The most wonderful thing is our beautiful ladies! But they're already here. - It's no time for jokes. - Flowers. Excellent, Olya! Attention, please. Now I will wave my hand, say: "a flower bouquet", and the flowers should appear on that table. As you can see, the wand is very easy to use. Excuse me, Kira Anatolyevna. Don't you think that to ensure objectivity the Wand should be handled by a disinterested person, unfamiliar with contemporary magic? - Fine, but where do we find one? - That's me. I am that person! I am the most suitable person! I don't know any magic, didn't even read fairytales as a kid! - Who is he? - I'm a man of business! I have an order! Pass it to me for a minute, I'll do it, you won't be disappointed. One, two, three! A flower bouquet! lt's working! Praise her quickly, she doesn't forgive anyone for her mistakes! - Victory! - What a success! - Academy! - Scrolls of fame! Meow! So, who wants another flower bouquet? Or "Bouquet of Abkhazia" wine? Thank you! Comrades, we are not finished yet! We have to think of a way to present our invention to the public at large. Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your help. Just put the wand in here. One fur-cap for winter, please? My ears are cold. Warm them at home. Laboratory of complete surprises Alyona Igorevna, why pick someone from the outside? - We have our own heroes. - Stop it, please. - Congratulations! - So, you got wind of it. - We didn't say anything. We are very happy for you. - Thanks, dears. - You're leaving? - Forever, Alyona Igorevna? - Alyona Igorevna will return. - She promised. Does Kira know? I didn't want to tell her before the trials, but now I think I have no choice. - Vitya, can you get me a ticket for the evening flight? - Sure. Foma, please send a wire to this address. What if we invite the WM acceptance committee not as usual in the course of work, but, say, on December 31 . Throw a big New Year party, with singing and dancing, and, most importantly, with the demonstration of our new invention. A ball - that's wonderful! - Impressive. - What do you say? - And farsighted! - I think so too! - What does he think? - Just a minute. That's untranslatable. Fat scoundrel! I suggest the following: A welcoming ceremony on official troikas, a Christmas tree with fireproof lights, and Father Frost from the local supplier. Followed by a modest meal plus dancing. - Three TV-sets in a row. - Isn't it a bit row...dy? We must invite a professional pop-band. - Maybe just use our amateurs? - No. Get someone to help you and start organising the New Year celebration. - Can I take Sanina Alyona Igorevna, if you don't object? - No objections. Ivan Stepanovich, what do you think? A pop group - that's good. But a committee on New Year's eve... - Would they come? - They will. You'll see to it personally. What do you mean? You'll be in Moscow tomorrow: invite them, persuade them. But I had other plans for tomorrow. I know, Ivan Stepanovich, and yet I insist. Fine. Come to my office before you leave, please. Olya, book a ticket for Ivan Stepanovich for today's evening flight. I'll provide the weather. Laboratory of complete surprises Alyona Igorevna, tell us more about him. What's he like? - He must be incredible! - Where did you meet? Alyona Igorevna, what does one need to do to be loved so much? Tell us. I can't put it all into words. You search or you don't, it doesn't matter: there are no clear paths or ready answers in love, But one thing I know, I know for sure... In love all is not that smooth and simple, And beauty is not a decisive factor. A woman must have some kind of enigma, A woman must have some kind of enigma, some kind of mystery about her. It's not easy to be always sweet and elegant, As if there were no cloudy days in your life. But to become someone's only one, Believe me, that's an even bigger task. In love all is not that smooth and simple, And beauty is not a decisive factor. Hey, who's that singing? Who's supposed to. A woman must have some kind of enigma, Some kind of mystery about her. Love will come to you one day and explain What I failed to explain right now, How each woman has her own enigma And her own mystery. In love all is not that smooth and simple, And beauty is not a decisive factor, A woman must have some kind of enigma, A woman must have some kind of enigma, Some kind of mystery about her. Sataneyev A.M. - Can I come, Apollon Mitrofanovich? - Come in, Kamneyedov, come in. I wanted to inform you of certain things. What, an inspector-general is coming? Sit down. I've overheard something, thought you might want to know. Your see, Alyona Igorevna is getting married. Sorry, l have to go. Morning of the First Century Smell of honey and mint, Red squirrels jumping on cedar trees. A merry company: The centaurs are running to somewhere Perhaps for a stroll, or perhaps, for business. She's busy with our amateur group. - This man is also waiting. - Waiting, very much so. I have an order. What is it? I'm so happy for you, Alyona! Come back after lunch. - Think she'll sign it? - Of course she will. Then I'll go have lunch. I'll go have lunch, too. Nightfall of the XX century. My heart is uneasy, I'll lean on a birch, Silent under the skies. Close my eyes And maybe I'll hear How stars, like blue cobbles, Ring under centaurs' feet. Let the centuries Fly over the earth Let no traces Be left anywhere But the centaurs, They existed! Centaurs, where have you gone to? Where? Centaurs! Centaurs! Centaurs! Centaurs! Centaurs! And you want to show this to the committee? No, in this form it will absolutely not do. I think, actually, it's not bad. Energetic, light. You? Here?! Disappear! She always works by the principle of "Let them be afraid, as long as they love". Why so strict, Kira? So that you don't stare where you're not supposed to. That's something new. The first jealousy episode in 7 years. You came in so unexpectedly. Sorry, I just came to say goodbye. You're angry? Understand, there are circumstances. It's the last time. The service sector, Kira, has no end. It's endless, like the Universe. And just as eternal. Unlike us. I promise. As soon as you return, I promise! I'm tired! See, even wizards can walk in circles. Is it hard to love a witch? It's hard when you're not loved. You are loved. Bless you. Yes... one needs sound health to work here. I don't know if we manage to see each other before New Year, in a private setting. So, here. - For you. - Not that, I plead you! But why? I already have 13 watches at home gifted by you. Let us stop at that magic number. - But I didn't prepare any other present. - Listen! Here's what you can bring me! You're something! One really can't be angry at you. - You are still a child! - I'm a woman. And that says it all. Enough! Hello... Speaking. Rumor guaranteed. Excellent! Long live rumors! What a lady! All I hear is "no" from you. - Why? I said "yes" once. - When? You asked whether I hear you well. Ivan Stepanovich! Season's greetings, Alyona Igorevna. Ivan Stepanovich, thank you for helping me out today! I'm very glad to see you, especially beaming this much. - Up to no good? - Good. I'm getting married. Congratulations from all my heart. Is that the guy? Of course not! He's in Moscow. I'm flying out tonight. - Evening flight? - Yes. I'm lucky, I'm on the same flight! That's great! Then you'll be a witness at our wedding. I accept this invitation with great pleasure And, please, accept this, without delay, so to speak. I hope at least you will like it. Ivan Stepanovich, thank you. I'm very grateful to you! It's so unexpected! - Thank you very much. - See you at the airport. - Hope you won't be late now. - Not anymore! - Apollon Mitrofanovich, I need yo- - Not to me. - But you don't even know wha- - If I don't then what's the deal? Our talking cat, or, rather, silent cat, has run away. - Which one? - There's only one! You just mentioned two. He escaped because of that "come in 2 days" of yours! I didn't invite cats! And you will come to my office as scheduled! Excuse me, could you tell me the way to the director's office? - First turn to the left, then to the right. - Then again to the left and then to the right. Thank you. So, it's first turn to the left. - And the finished products warehouse? - You'll see. Everything is in progress, Kira Anatolyevna. Although, Alyona Igorevna is flying out tonight. And I'm not well-versed in music, or pop groups. They might send us something unsuitable. Flying out? You've told her my instructions? Of course. But she wouldn't listen. That's strange. What's wrong with her? Tell me. There is one thing. Marriage. - She's getting married. - Really? That changes everything. Will have to let her go then. To lvan Stepanovich Kivrin. - What's the matter? - What nonsense! What has gone to your head? Nothing, just the facts, as they say, can be quite stubborn. Does that surprise you? He's handsome, single! She also... dresses quite well. What's wrong, you look upset. - State the facts. - Please, they are evident to everyone. And then it was him today who made you accept the wand. You wouldn't have ever accepted its democratic look. - Go on. - Her fiance's name is Ivan. The whole lab knows that. She was just hiding the last name. And that they're flying to Moscow for the wedding you can check even now. Your secretary has her written request. By the way, they're on the same flight. Olya, do you have Sanina's request? Yes, Kira Anatolyevna, it's here. - May I go to lunch now? - Please do. - Continue. - What's more to say! I just saw them kissing in the cloakroom. And then he, excuse me, hung a watch necklace on her neck. Lies! The necklace is lies! It can't be! Why get angry at me, Kira Anatolyevna?! Call Alyona Igorevna in and see for yourself. The necklace, I'm sorry, is right on her chest. Dirty tricks! Dirty tricks! - Olga! - You let her go to lunch. - Bring him here! - Kivrin is already gone. - Sanina! - Yes. Right now! Dirty tricks! Are you finished with Kira Anatolyevna? May I come in? - I'll allow myself to detain you for a few minutes. - But I'm in a hurry. You're going to Moscow, to see your fiance, I presume. That's right, but.. - How do you know? - I do. I also know that the two of us were appointed to organize the New Year's ball. - But I can't. - What does this mean? I'm approaching you with all my heart, so to speak, and you chose some boy instead of me. I'm sorry I don't understand, Apollon Mitrofanovich. I gifted you some things on holidays. Flowers, for instance. You didn't seem to mind. That gave me grounds to think, to hope. Apollon Mitrofanovich, you sure like jokes. No, I'm not joking. You have a vivid imagination. I had no idea. You should write poetry. Do you? I don't. That's why Kira Anatolyevna chose you. Do join in. You'll have to, anyway. We'll see about that. We'll see, we'll see. What a woman! What a woman! Why can't you undestand me? I should be the one understanding you? Me? Have you never been in love? - Incredible insolence! - Insolence? But I'm getting married! Married, understand? Why so fast? Why do you say that? Ivan and I have decided long ago. So you just want to inform me after the fact? No way! What do you mean? You just... - But you have no right! - Now you bring up your rights! Mind that you have obligations. l'm not obliged to organize any concerts for you. You must follow all my instructions! - Please, he's waiting for me. - That's fine, he can wait. And cool off a bit. Kirs Anatolyevna, I beg you. Please, I have neither strength, nor time. Look at the time. Right, you're sneering at me. It's you who's sneering. Organise your own concerts, I'll go to him anyway! - Sanina, wait! I forbid! - I will still go! - I'll issue a reprimand. - Too bad, I'll go anyway! - No, you won't! - I will, I will! Silence! Busy again! Why did I have lunch! You won't fly anywhere, girl! You won't fly anywhere, girl. Won't fly anywhere. I take the spring from your heart. And put winter in instead. What's happening? Are we on fire or not? What's happening? - Hey, are we on fire - or not? - We're sunbathing! I'm sorry, Kira Anatolyevna, something is with my head... It's alright. I'll start preparing for the ball right away. lt seems the ball will be very important for us. - Am I correct? - Now absolutely correct. Thank you for your trust. - Careful. - Excuse me. - I must have slipped. - I understand. - Sorry. - It's fine. Goodbye. It happens. It will soon pass. It happens. - Who are you? - I'm a guest! - From where? - From the South! - What are you doing here? - You see, I just need the signature. The secretary is out, all this thunder and lightning. You're still experimenting. - Right, was anyone here besides you? - Not a soul. - Where? - What? - The pass. - The pass? Oh, I've lost so much weight! Where's the pass? - Where do I sign? - Sign? Here! Thank you. Here's our Alyona, deep in science, only the head is sticking out. Alyona Igorevna, do you like it? We're getting ready for the ball. Where's your braid? It suited you so well! Outrageous! This is not a music hall! Nor a hair salon! Get out! Stop this noise when I'm talking! I'm not keeping anyone here against their will! Do you understand?! I'm being yelled at, hence, I exist. Alyona, everything is fine! Flight 313, seat 13, departing at 20:30. Everything in order. I've sent your wire, the addressee will meet you. All's good. Best of luck, so to speak! Comrade Bryl, I didn't ask you to wire anything. And I very much ask you to write an explanation within the next 10 minutes as to why were you absent during working hours. - What's wrong with you, Alyona? - And stop calling me Alyona. Be so kind as to address me by my first name and patronymic. That's one thing. And then, I'm not flying anywhere. Please, return the ticket. What about... As for you, comrade Kovrov, be so kind as to come to the lab - dressed in proper attire. - Yes, sorry. In a suit, like comrade Bryl's, at least. As for you, comrade Bryl, take you hat off in my presence! How did it go, Alyona? Have you seen Kira Anatolyevna? Has she signed it? That's no business of yours, honey! - Is Alyona Igorevna here? - She's here. But looks like out there. I'm so happy to see you Apollon Mitrofanovich. Please come in. Stop crying, go home and get yourself in order. I'll need you both this evening. Sit down, please. Pay no attention to them. - I was actually going to see you, Apollon Mitrofanovich. - Glad to hear that. I'm so glad to be working with you. - What will you assign to me? - The pop group. An excellent pop group, at that. Pardon me, back in a minute. Kira Anatolyevna, so to speak, gave strict instructions. I understand. Kovrov, are you following our discussion? Yes, l'm following everything. Tomorrow morning I expect to hear your ideas about the group. How can I report about a pop group? Where can l get a pop group at night? You're telling this to me and to the deputy director? Here, at our Laboratory of complete surprises! - Kovrov, are you a mage or not? - Woah, I am. Without "woah" please. I can without "woah", and without WOW too. You're wrong, young man, only our institute has mages and wizards in our ordinary staff. What would you be without our institute? Nothing! Just an individual. Excuse me, Alyona Igorevna. Oh no, a very accurate and correct observation, Apollon Mitrofavonich. - Do you understand, Kovrov? - I understand alright. - We understand. Can we go? - Go and do some work. Yes, ma'am. Today you invited me to lunch. I'd like to compensate for my refusal by inviting you to dinner. A simple, neighborly gesture. We live in the same building, but you've never visited me. What's the matter? I don't want to hear a word about that Sanina of yours! We just want to know what happened. - She's dizzy from success, that's it! - Doesn't look like it. The change in our Alyona Igorevna was drastic, and too sudden. Must be something serious. Sataneyev, maybe? May well be. He's been in the office all day. He's there even now. They must be talking about her. - Let's eavesdrop. - How dare you?! How dare you propose such a thing! Of course we can't! He just blurted it out without thinking. - Me?! - No, fine, you didn't. You were told no. Let's go, I'll explain. Please do! - It can happen to anyone. - The explainer! Mages, wizards! Turn on the intercom for them! To think of it! One can solve these things without any higher education. I've always admired your gift of persuasion. - It wasn't only persuasion. - Power? - Force. - I understand. If you understand, go ahead. And remember: they must not meet. If she kisses him before the New Year... You are so clumsy, Vitenka! Can a woman reveal her secret to two men at once! Sure, Foma, you're the expert on human nature. It's you who flies in the magic clouds, and I, the sinner, have to walk on earth: pretend to be a rabbit, or a mousy, or a kind cat. - That's also magic, domestic magic. - Listen, dear. Go away. Could you show me the way out? There's no one else to ask. - Everyone disappeared at 6pm. Is that some kind of magic? - Sure is. Do you have a pen and paper? Draw him a plan how to get out of here. Vitya, draw it yourself, I can't - too pressed for time. - Think he knows already? - I'm sure. Hey, draw it. - In a hurry? - Very much so. Tomorrow I'll be back home. Got the order signed. - Thought l'd be here till the New Year, even fell asleep in the chair. - Go left there. Then I hear bolts of thunder, like we have in the mountains. A lady comes out, then the director. She didn't ask me a thing, she knows! And signed everything! - Where did you hear the thunder? - From there, behind the wall. I saw lightning, too. Excellent institute! Just a bit noisy with too many corridors. Finished the plan? Thank you very much. I'll go! Shoo! - That's it! - What? - She cast a spell on her! A spell! - Who, Kira? - Yes. Won't be lifted unless she kisses her fiance before the New Year. - Why did she do that? - No idea, maybe Sataneyev helped. Told her they would lose a valuable employee. Meanwhile, he's pursuing Alyona himself. He's getting on my nerves! I'll turn him into dust! Or into dirt, slush, mud! - Into... what do you call it?... - THAT will float. How could she fall for that?! Kira, a smart woman! What are you talking about? Kira is just a woman, too! Enough of this wailing. We must act. Easier said than done: Kira is not easily dissuaded. Kivrin could do that, but he's gone. We must send a wire to him. To her fiance. Tell him to come at once. - Give me the address. - Spinoza! - What did you draw the plan on? - Alert! - Stop! - They will take away my order! - Give the paper back! - No! - Just that piece of paper! - No! It's not a paper, it's an order! A legal order, stamped accordingly! Stamped five times! Take him from the right, I'll go from the left! - We just need the paper. - Camel! Out of my way. He's getting away! Why didn't you take the paper? I'll explain everything! lt's not for me, but for the whole sunny South! Let's do it officially! Here it is. To the post office! Again, my good luck! My order's here. Everything's fine. This way. No, not there, not again. Enough is enough! Aha! Who designs these buildings?! Who?! Who designs them this way?! A vague night shadow is dreaming on the floor. I approach The ancient wise mirror Like a clear sky Of a great hight I look into the mirror To see you. The glass between us Is like moonlight, But nothing stronger Than that glass exists. I stand before it, As bright-eyed as ever, Just don't walk away from your side. Once again so similar We stand side to side My guarded glance Meets yours. Eternal depth in my glance, Bright stars shine, Once again I'm the first To lower my eyes. The glass between us Is like moonlight, But nothing stronger Than that glass exists. I stand before it, As bright-eyed as ever. Just don't walk away from your side. Ringing silence In the frame of the night. Who is the real one? Could it be you? Beyond the woods, the rivers, Could there be a place, Where you look in the mirror, And seek to see my face? The glass between us Is like moonlight. And nothing stronger Than that glass exists. I stand before it, As bright-eyed as ever, Just don't walk away from your side. Question number one. Am I being fair to Alyona? It was her own fault. One can't forgive treachery. Besides, Ivan Stepanovich must realize and understand his mistake or delusion. I'm not sure what's closer to the truth. You are driven by anger. You are being unfair. Any woman in my position would do the same. You are not just any woman. You must be very careful. How much longer must I sacrifice myself? lt's easier to sacrifice others. Alright. Show her to me. Now show him. Enough! Let everything stay as it is. I'm all ears. You know, all of a sudden I'm fed up with my lab. This service sector. It's not prestigious, is it? No scope, no scope. And the people I have to work with? Take Bryl. Or this Kovrov with his ridiculous enthusiasm. He is absolutely incapable of real magic. Take my word, he'll let us down with the pop group tomorrow. Don't worry, I've taken precautions. Tomorrow Kamneyedov... Will bring a group from Moscow, in good style. From Moscow? Apollon Mitrofavonich, I'm so fed up with Kitezhgrad. That, I must tell you, is a more complicated task. No one gets anything for free in this world. Even fools. It's not about you. Go to your fiance. You'll be in Moscow. I have no fiance in Moscow. Or in Kitezhgrad, so far. Girls! Why stop in the doorway, dears? Bring it in. Bring it in, we have nothing left. Here. - Where is the photo? - What p- Just a second! Sly fox! Why did you take it? I showed it to the girls. - And what did they say? - They said she's beautiful. We already know that. You're not bad either, but she's better. - Time to go to the airport. - Wait, it's too early! Better be early, Alyona doesn't like to wait. Vanya, are you afraid of her? Put on your coat, or mom will be worried. She won't, she let me go forever. I'll stay with you. What are you talking about?! Put on your coat! "With me"! - Ivan Puhov? - Yes. - A wire for you. - Thank you. - Sign here. - What's there? "Alyona will not come, is under a magic spell." - Some nonsense. - Maybe it's a prank? And if it's not? Is it possible to cast a magic spell for real? Anything is possible, if you really want it. Where do I go now? The train station? - Puhovs? - Yes. The car is waiting. - Hurry up, or you'll be late. - To where? "Where"? To the station. Your train leaves in 40 minutes. That's it! Thank you. Go home. Mom will be worried. - I'll see you to the vagon. - Go home, I said! Vanya! What if you won't get a ticket? Mr. Puhov! Urgently come to vagon No.13, we are waiting. - Vanya! Where are you going? Here's No. 13. - Why are you here? Comrade Puhov, if I'm not mistaken? - How do you know me? - We've been waiting for you, worrying even! We've been notified, heard a lot. As soon as the train starts, I'll bring you some hot tea. Nina! Go home! I'm going, I'm going! - Comrades, please clear the compartment. - Is something wrong? We have our tickets! This man is from the Incredible Services. What do we do now? - That's impossible. - No way to treat people. I repeat: he is from the Incredible Services. So it's in your interest to go quickly... Why? I'm sorry, I don't understand anything either. - Why?! - Take a seat. - Why did you do that? One bunk is enough for me. - Why? Actually, I don't know why myself. It's been authorized! To the person who finds me! I'll come to you no matter what. Katya! She's still in love when asleep. Vanya, darling. - We must tell Kovrov. - By all means. - What, again? - Not a drop. I was waiting for you. - So, how did it go? - He's coming. Let me give you some relief. - Hard work, huh? - Don't say. Trying to persuade taxi drivers, conductors, musicians - I nearly died. Yes, people nowadays are hard. Hard to hypnotise. - What about the musicians? - They were in the compartment, I've barely managed to kick them out. Couldn't you persuade them to come here? We could have solved the pop group issue. Everyone knows what to do. That's enough, I'm better! We should talk to this Ivan. So sudden and without information he can create many problems! - We should, but when? - Right now, of course. - This very minute. - That would be great, but when..? Why are you giving me that look, Vitenka? Just thinking, estimating. Well, you go on estimating, while I'll go home. I must have left my key in the door. Open the door. Bit later. Talk to Ivan and go to bed. Talk to him yourself, wizard, you're paid more. Only the accounting knows who's paid more. We need domestic magic here, Foma, understand? And I have a headache. You're much better at it than I am. So get ready, you're going to his compartment. Vitya, are you crazy? They'll take me for a train thief, I'll get arrested, beaten up. Imagine: there are wood-goblins, house-spirits, and you'll be a train-goblin. This doesn't suit you, please. Well, good luck to you. - Train-goblin! - What about my shoes?! Forgive me, they fell down by accident. - Who are you? - Me? A train-goblin. Who? Ever heard of wood-goblins, water-spirits? Well, I'm a train-goblin. Temporarily. For special circumstances. Be careful! I'm very careful. Well, hello. Just don't touch, please, don't. I'm here for business. - You really are Puhov Ivan Sergeyevich? - Actually, yes. Have you received the wire about Alyona Igorevna? Yes, l have. I just don't get it, it said she was under a magic spell. Maybe you can you explain what's going on? A spell is when you are turned into some object. Say, a log or a goat. What? Any magic manual will tell you that. Everybody knows that and nobody is interested. This practice has nearly been abandoned. But if your appearance remains, but the spring and all that is taken from your heart and replaced with freezing winter, that is what we call real magic. The person becomes different. He understands everything, but now sees it differently. So you will find Alyona Igorevna quite changed. Who could have done such an awful thing to her? The point is not who, but how to undo the spell. The point is both - who and how! How do we lift the spell? - Every evil spell, young man, has a remedy. - Which one? Love, young man. - Love? - Yes, love. Do you really love Alyona Igorevna? Well, I do. "Well"! A lot?! - How is that important? - Very! A lot. That's for you to prove tomorrow. And now sleep, recharge your batteries, you'll need it tomorrow. Sleep, now? You must be kidding! You absolutely need some rest. And remember: Tomorrow, don't be surprised by anything. And don't do anything without consulting comrade Kovrov or comrade Foma Ostapovich Bryl. Especially the latter! That's good. Now sleep. Time for sleep! Don't you argue with me. And don't you open you eyes until morning. Everyone in the valleys and hills, under ground and at sea - It's time for bed! Time for sleep! Night solves all problems simple and complicated. Fixes everything that the day Broke and messed up. Everything else People are not meant to know. Still awake? Go to sleep, I tell you. Time for sleep! Early morning is wiser than night. Put off all your worries till morning. If you believe in good, Maybe, the world will get better. Time for sleep! Time for sleep! Night solves all problems simple and complicated. Fixes everything that the day Broke and messed up.
