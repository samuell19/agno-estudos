On the 1st day of the 3rd month in the 17th year of Kangxi's reign, Wu Sangui proclaimed himself as the Emperor of Great Zhou. In the same year, Wu nominated the general, Ma Bao, to attack a strategic location with the armed forces of 500,000 men. The location was called Yongxing. - I have a report! - Speak! What? The Emperor of Great Zhou, Wu Sangui, passed away. All troops returned to the capital for his funeral. EMPEROR ZHAOWU OF GREAT ZHOU The Qing army counterattacked. - Wu's men were dispirited. - General, spare my life! To protect Wu's descendants, Ma Bao made a plan with the minister secretly. They hunted for the best escorts nationwide to assist with their plan. The plan was named the Eulogy of Pear Blossoms. QINGPING ESCORT GROUP Instead of starting a profitable business, why did you establish an escort group? That calculative Abacus Head, will his ideas make a fortune? As a foreigner who can't even work in a government office, - he's always counting money. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, - 7, 8, 9. - He is likely just a thug who sells fake medicine! This won't do! What's more, you can't earn a penny by setting up an escort group. At worst, you'll lose your life. Moreover, if you lose what you're escorting... If it is lost... I'll have to sell my house to pay for the loss. - How is that possible? - It is. - Bad news, Liu'an! - What's wrong? - Something happened. - What's wrong? - We lost what we're escorting! - We lost it? Untie me now! Untie me quickly. No way! If you don't date that lady, you can't go anywhere. - Is this the time for dating? - Exactly! Untie me! Lame Man, I'll stall for some time and you'll play it by ear. - No problem. - Sure! Go! JUYI HALL How is Chief Smiling Tiger? I'm in charge today. It's Master Eight. The Qingping Escort Group went past your turf. Our men might have been oblivious to your rules and offended all of you. I've come to apologize. Since we have seized your item, why are you apologizing? He's lying. We have been friends with Chief Smiling Tiger for years. If you, Master Eight, are now in charge, The Qingping Escort Group will have you as our friend! Good! I like making friends. Chief Yang. Go ahead! Chief Yang! If you can't get the wine in the jar before the wood is burned down, don't blame me for not following the rules! Watch out! - Well done! - Well done! - Well done! - Well done! It serves him right. Pockmark, wake up. Wake up! Someone carried Big Girl away. For Big Girl's good looks? Do you mean they like Big Girl? It's exactly what you think. - They... - The antidote. - Greetings, Chief. - Greetings, Chief. Smiling Tiger! It's me! - Pockmark? - Yes! Your disguise is amazing! I didn't recognize you. Enough nonsense. Get going! - Greetings, Chief. - Good day. Stop fighting! How dare you hit me? You dare hit me? Stop it! It's me! Kill him! How dare you steal our items? He should be punished. Throw him down hard! Broadsword, pick him up again! Stop! I'm Pockmark! He's disguised as him! Kill him! Where did you take our item? Your item? Put me down! Stop! Broadsword, that's Pockmark! - Put him down. - Don't! Don't let go of me! What is it? Nothing. Don't yell now. You can yell all you want later. I don't have any evil intention. - Let me untie you. - Sure. What are you doing? It's only fun if I take this off. Darn you... - Chief? - Who is it? Chief, Master Eight asked you to go to the hall. Yell when I'm back. The hall. This way. Darn you... Don't yell. Do you want everyone to hear you? Darn you! It's me! Move the picture away. Come closer. It's me. Pockmark? Wait a moment! Does a cripple work for Master Eight? Certainly. Look up. Are you kidding me? Everyone's here? Broadsword! You jerk. I am a man! Are you kidding me? You didn't even judge the gender correctly before you got him onto your bed. You're so horny that you've become dumb. I'm sorry! - Good! - Good! - Place it here. - Here. Chief Yang, you sure are straightforward. I promise, as long as it's escorted by the Qingping Escort Group, I won't steal from you again. Sure, we'll get going. Goodbye. Hold the flag of the escort group high! - Heroes gather! - Heroes gather! Brothers for life! - Loyal to friends! - Loyal to friends! Minister. General. How did it go? Two out of the five escort groups fled. The other two are still looking for the lost items. Only one group made it. Which escort group is it? The Qingping Escort Group. How about their capability? I've tried them out in person. Chief Yang Liu'an stayed calm in the face of danger. He can take on great responsibilities. All right. You're dismissed. Yes. I'll take my leave. General, for safety reasons, once this is accomplished, the escort group need not return. CLIENT, MA BAO Thank you, sir. I'll get going. Chief Yang, I have another important task that I'd like you to escort personally to the destination. "Chong'an Chain Bridge"? It's easy to make a fortune in such turbulent times. You are right. Guys, after completing this task, we'll lead a better life! - Great! - Great! - Cheers. - Cheers. - Let's enjoy the wine! - Enjoy it! He's paying us so much to escort a married lady. Isn't that too odd? XIASI PIER This way, Madam. Be careful. WU RESIDENCE OFFICIAL ROAD XIAOJIANGKOU Hold the flag of the escort group high! Heroes gather! Brothers for life! - Loyal to friends! - Loyal to friends! Get those who appreciate flowers to join us. Ma Biao. Which route are they on? The minister is very cunning. It's hard for me to guess which route they are on. I'll help you get what you want. You'll get me the treasure map. I got us some help to make sure it goes as planned. Zhu You wants the beauty in the palanquin for the sake of true love. You want to get the treasure map for the sake of wealth. I want to capture Ma Bao for a promotion. There's no conflict of interest between us. If you think it through, defect and join us. I can guarantee that you'll be rich and famous. I'll handle my own business. Ma Bao won't be fooled by your tricks. Lame Man, make an arrangement. Get Madam a place here to take a rest. Sure. What are you doing? What else? I'm unloading the carriage after a day. It's fine. Madam will rest in the carriage. The owner and horse are tired. How can we travel without a horse? I said, no! Lame Man. In such a desolate place, there is no nice food. I hope Madam won't mind. It tastes good. I thank you on Madam's behalf. - Lame Man. - Lame Man. General. It's said that the royal consort is going into hiding with the treasure map. Everyone is out to get the map. There's no turning back. Tell all of our men to take down the leaders of the bandits. Yes. Protect our item! Protect our item! What's wrong? What's going on? Broadsword, do you have inflammation? Your urine has an awful smell. Eat slowly. Liu'an, here. Have a steamed bun. - Mother! - Mother! Civilians suffer when there's a war. - Physician Jia. - Coming. Let me take a look. - When will the war end? - Mother! Let's go. Let's go. She won't make it. My dear... My dear, you mustn't die. - Mother! - My dear. Sir, where are you going? We are homeless. Where can we go? We'll go where our legs can carry us. Here you go. Thank you. My dear... The Qing army has arrived. Whatever the dynasty, as long as there is a war, it's always the civilians that suffer. Mother. - Liu'an! - Lame Man is here. Lame Man, why are you hurt? There's a small troop of the Qing army ahead. It's just a cut. Lame Man, stanch the bleeding. As far as I know, they are still in Weng City. They can't arrive so soon. - Exactly. - They may be scouts. If we run into them, we might get into a fight. Let's take a detour. - Yes. - Yes. You're still awake? Liu'an. I took a nap. You should get some sleep. I'll take your shift. I am not tired. You should get some sleep. We're braving the wind and dew. We didn't make much money these years either. How about this? After we finish this task, you can start a small business. Don't keep working with us. What do you mean by that? Our escort business is looking up. Do you want to kick me out? No, I don't mean that. What do you mean then? I... Anyway, listen up. I'll cling to the escort group for life. It's not a big deal if you lose your item. We can compensate for the loss. I've met that lady. Although... she has protruding teeth, it doesn't matter that she's a bit short and ugly. What matters is that she's very curvy. She has the looks that bring good luck to her husband. When you look at her, especially her bottoms, you can tell that she'll give birth to sons. - Definitely. She's what I like. - Father! I like that! - Protect Madam. - Yes. Don't go after them! Sir. - Did you see the person in the carriage? - No. Those men are hard to tackle. Our business is important. Retreat! Madam, here you go. Laohukou is not far from here. Stay alert. Stay alert! - Yes, Liu'an. - We will. A good beginning is half the task. Guys, it's a good chance. Get ready. Did you see whether Zhu You and Harar brought their men here? Not yet. This can't be right. It's too risky. Retreat quickly. I didn't get to see her, but I'm sure the person in the carriage can't be her. You knew it's a hoax just by seeing the carriage? If you love someone, everything about her is carved into your soul. When the wind blows, within a ten-mile radius, I can recognize her scent. I only know about body odors. So many people are protecting an imposter? If someone attacks the ship, ram into them and take them down together. Yes, Minister. I'm certain she's not on the ship. The wind didn't carry the familiar scent of hers. Sir, the woman in Ma Bao's carriage is an imposter. Could they really be with the Qingping Escort Group? How is it? Wait for the wind. Can you really smell her? Is that her scent? It's not hers. Catch him! Don't let Zhu You get away! How dare you steal the consort's underwear? - Lame Man. - Yes? We've traveled for five days. We should be halfway to the destination, right? Yes, Liu'an. We'll reach Chong'an in three days. Are you writing a letter? Do you miss your daughter? Yes, Liu'an. For half my life, I've achieved nothing. My wife complained that I am useless. She took my daughter to her parents' home. Why do people call you a quack? He's greedy. He didn't cure poor patients, nor treat those with little money well. Ailments got serious, and serious illness ended in death. He's a capable doctor without any morals. What is he, if not a quack? Am I right, Broadsword? Physician Jia, why are you so mean? The worst immoral physician is the one that uses expensive medicine to scam you. It's certain that you can't be cured, but you'll feel better. Untimely treatment is the best way to earn money. Who will get treatment from you if your patient dies? Am I right, Physician Jia? Pockmark, don't imitate my stutter. I give treatment for money, you treat pocks for ladies. We are soon arriving. CORDATE TELOSMA INN It's your sweetheart's shop, Pockmark. Madam! Mr. Wang. You haven't been here for ages. Where have you been? Don't say such nonsense. We only met once. How are we that close? Mr. Wang, I'm lucky to see you again in such turbulent times. I must have done good in my previous life. If my husband wasn't here last time, I would've accompanied you. Men and women shouldn't be so close. Aren't you worried about damaging your reputation? Mr. Wang, make yourself feel at home. My husband wasn't here last time. No, it's this time. What she said is right. Cordate Telosma Inn is your home. Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang! - Don't touch me. - Don't be shy. Exactly. Come and taste the cherry blossom liquor that I made. I am on a mission so I can't drink alcohol. You are so arrogant. I don't want to serve you. At Cordate Telosma Inn, no one disrespects the owner. I'd like to toast to you on behalf of the owner. Get going. How about this? I will drink this up on behalf of the escort group. You're not qualified! What a vixen. I think you should get cleaned up. Gentlemen, how did you get so drenched in such a short time? Madam, no matter how the Qingping Escort Group has offended you in the past, I'll apologize to you first. I hope you'll let us through. Should we cross paths again, I'll surely thank you handsomely. Chief, don't act ignorant. If you won't leave Chen Yuanyuan with us today, none of you will get to leave! Chen Yuanyuan? She's referring to the renowned beauty, Wu Sangui's royal consort, Chen Yuanyuan. We are from an ordinary family. How can she be Chen Yuanyuan? Gentlemen, you must protect us. Chief, it's best to know which way the wind blows. Everyone is searching for Chen Yuanyuan. Only by handing her over can you ensure the safety of your escort group. The Qingping Escort Group goes by our own rules. Madam, please let us through. There are just a few of you going against everyone. Don't you think too highly of yourselves? - Pockmark. - Paralysis powder? It's said the paralysis powder is colorless and odorless. It's only effective when it's in contact with water. That's right. The "rain" is working to our advantage. Minister, we'll arrive at the meetup point within half a day. We don't know how it is with the royal consort and General Ma. Please inform our men to stay alert. Once we meet up with General Ma and the royal consort, block the river for three days and let no one through. CORDATE TELOSMA INN Everyone knows that Chen Yuanyuan holds the treasure map of Great Zhou. Only by handing over Chen Yuanyuan can you keep your escort group safe. Otherwise, even if you make it past this inn, you will never get to the Chain Bridge. Be gentle. You'll regret this! Go easy. Don't hurt your breasts. You... An escort group's priority is to uphold integrity. It doesn't matter if she is Chen Yuanyuan. We have to protect our client. Hold the flag of the escort group high! - Heroes gather! - Heroes gather! Brothers for life! - Loyal to friends! - Loyal to friends! Principles are principles. Friendship is friendship! -With my brothers, -With my brothers, - the world is ours to roam! - the world is ours to roam! Sir, you were right. Zhu You did keep some things to himself. Chen Yuanyuan is really in the escort group. Ma Bao, your Eulogy of Pear Blossoms plan is nothing more than this. Once we get to the meeting point tomorrow, our major troop will continue east. You'll lead a small troop to make preparations in advance. Once the minister, the royal consort, and Sha Ma board the ship, leave no one else alive. It's better if fewer people know about it. In the worst case, your men will also have to be... I disagree. Ma Biao and the others are my comrades. I have a question. Will we all have to be killed once this task is accomplished? Do you plan to revolt? I won't dare. I've served you for years. I know very well that you regard us as brothers. I also know that for the sake of Great Zhou, you'll stoop to anything. Now that Great Zhou is gone, I wish that you will show some mercy and spare these men who fought by your side. The wind is rising. The wind is rising! Pay attention to the sand. Don't let it get into your eyes. Get up. My brothers. As subjects, we can't live if our ruler wants us dead. "We can't live if our ruler wants us dead"? That is nonsense! Without a country, how can there be a ruler? General, as long as you spare them, we'll part ways from now on. - General, don't make us do it! - General, don't make us do it! - General, don't make us do it! - General, don't make us do it! - General, don't make us do it! - General, don't make us do it! Attack! - Attack! - Attack! Barge through! Protect the lady! - Go after them! - Go after them! Hurry! Round them up from here! Don't let Chen Yuanyuan run away! Broadsword! Run, Broadsword! I can hold them off! Run! Bring it on! Run! Stop fighting! Run! Step aside! Stop it! Ma Biao, the general has been kind to us. We can't be ungrateful and act without faith! Loyalty is useless! Loyalty is useless! Useless! Broadsword! Broadsword. Liu'an, it's time for an alternate plan. Lame Man, take them through Yedong River. Their cavalry will be rendered useless. We'll meet up at Baizhang Water Fall. - Yes! - Blacksmith! Liu'an, I've got it. A Duo, arrange for our men to protect Madam. - Yes. - Sha Ma, get her out. Be fast! The others, come with me to hold them off! - Yes! - Go! - Go! - Be quick! - This way! - Be careful. This way! Ma Biao, bring it on. Broadsword! - Stop. - Stop. It's empty. Go after them! Go! Attack! Second Wolf! Blacksmith! Broadsword! Broadsword! Run! I won't make it. Nonsense! If you die, how about your mother? - Do as I say. - Let's go! - Run! - Leave now! - Get up! - Over there! Attack! Pockmark, take Blacksmith with you! Broadsword, run! Run! Don't let them run away! - Broadsword! - Liu'an, leave me! - Broadsword! - Liu'an, run! - Let go of me! Broadsword! - Run! - Broadsword! - Run! - Let go of me! Broadsword! - Run! - Broadsword! Let go of me! - Run! As long as we live, we keep our items safe! Broadsword! Broadsword! Broadsword! Run! The medicine kit! The medicine kit! My brother, hang in there. Quickly, get me the gauze. Quickly, the gauze. Yes. - Blacksmith. - Hang in there. Physician Jia, don't bother. Liu'an, the bleeding won't stop. - There's nothing we can do. - Blacksmith! Who are you? Why are so many people after us? What about the treasure map? What are you doing? Go away! - Speak! - Black Tower! Liu'an, I'm an uneducated man. But if I were to die, I want to know the reason! We work as escorts just to make a living! We must at least know who we are protecting, right? We feel sad that the men in the escort group were killed. But you have to abide by your rules! You have to accomplish your task after accepting it! Our group also has a rule. We can't shelter criminals. Liu'an, it's a tough task. You must be more careful. - Blacksmith! - Blacksmith! - My brother! - Blacksmith! Blacksmith. Just deduct the money for my father's coffin from my wages. Liu'an, I'll still be your friend in the next life. - Blacksmith! - Blacksmith! - Blacksmith! - Blacksmith! - Blacksmith! - Blacksmith! Blacksmith... Harar, Zhu You is bringing his men here. Good timing. Quickly! Harar, that's a wise plan. We'll take advantage of their fight. Fourth Wolf, get our men here. Minister, Yang Liu'an's escort group and General Ma haven't arrived. We've sent out our scout according to the planned route to welcome them 50 miles from here. But they haven't shown up. Minister, please advise. Keep on checking along the way. Yes! The warriors of the Qingping Escort Group, I'm sorry. Liu'an, this is a tough task. If we're escorting a criminal, our families will be killed. I especially miss my daughter. Liu'an. Forgive me for leaving. Physician Jia! - Physician Jia. - Wait a moment. Bring your daughter home. I can't accept the money, Liu'an. Take care, my brother. - Take it. - Thank you, Liu'an. Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Chief Yang. We had no choice but to conceal our identities. The war has caused the civilians great suffering. I'm returning to Chong'an to persuade General Ma Bao and King of Chu to dismiss the 500,000 soldiers. Only by ending the war can we bring peace to the people. Liu'an. I know you're sad about Blacksmith's and Broadsword's deaths. But as escorts, don't we make a living at the risk of our lives? Though we were born into lowly families, we can still uphold our integrity. I'm aware of that. It's hard to predict what will happen later. Be it right or wrong, we'll follow you. A Duo, why don't you... Liu'an. Do you remember how I showed up at your house? My father was ill and we needed money for treatment. He had no choice, but to sell me as a concubine. However, before the marriage was consummated, that man died. Since then, I was called a widow. If you didn't take me in, I'm not sure whether I'll still be alive now. If we can get through this safely, I'll marry you officially. Let's get to Julan City before it gets dark. That's probably still within Zhou's borders. JULAN CITY If you want to survive, get lost! Run! Lame Man, watch the stairs. - Go after them! - Go after them! Here I am! Black Tower! Black Tower, I'll save you. Black Tower, run! Physician Jia, why have you returned? Being an escort is risking our lives to make a living. How can you not have a physician in the group? Go and help Liu'an! Big Girl, be careful! Quickly! Go and save Big Girl. This isn't how to use a pot! Loser! I'm sorry, my friend! Black Tower! Black Tower, are you all right? Young master... What "young master"? I've served your father as a child. That makes you my young master. Master made me join you for fear that you'll starve. However, I didn't like being an escort. I just wanted to protect you. My brother... My brother... My brother! Liu'an, there's a path behind that leads to the theater. - Lame Man, keep watch. - Yes! Come on! Come this way! Come here! Dabiao! Dabiao. Old man. Remember to write to my father. Tell him I'm working with Liu'an... Da Biao, don't worry. I'll take the letter to your father. Hang in there. Da Biao! Da Biao! Big Girl! Look at how you have ended up. How can I let my daughter marry you? Liu'an, I'm a real man. I'm still single and childless. Don't ask me to dress up like a lady next time. Gentlemen of the Qingping Escort Group! If you back out now and stop meddling in this business, I, Harar, won't hold it against you! How much did Ma Bao pay you? I will pay you double! How's that? Liu'an, we have our rules. Do you want us all dead? Heroes. Chief Yang and the other heroes, they are after me. I just hope you can protect my grandson so that he can return to Chong'an and fulfill my last wish. I will be grateful. - Madam, don't! - Madam, please get up. Madam, please get up. It's my honor to have taken on this task. The most important escort task in the world is to fight for the people. Madam, I hope you can remember what you said. Please don't worry, Madam. The Qingping Escort Group will never quit a task. Barge in and attack! Charge! - Search carefully! - Yes! How's the situation, Pockmark? Liu'an, they got in. Let's stick to our plan. General Ma will arrive if we hold out until dawn. - Be careful. - Yes. Search upstairs! - Ahead! - Go after them! Over here! Over there! Upstairs! Upstairs! Go! Attack! Unless necessary, you mustn't expose your identity. Don't worry, Father. Go ahead. Yes, Madam! - Take good care of Madam. - Yes. Who is it? Liu'an, go upstairs! A Duo! I'm fine. Protect Madam. A Duo! A Duo! A Duo! A Duo! Physician Jia! Physician Jia! Becoming a real physician... Makes me so proud. My wife... - Father... - Let's go. Take our daughter home. Liu'an. A Duo. I hope that when I meet you in the next life, I will be unmarried. A Duo, don't say that. Hang in there. I'll take you home now. I'll marry you when we get home! Hang in there. Promise me... In our next life, we'll be together again. A Duo... A Duo! Ma Biao, good timing. Let's wipe out all the rascals from the escort group. We'll share fame and wealth. Sure! I've told you, if you talk about defecting to the Qing Dynasty again, don't blame me for being ruthless. Mr. Ma, it's great that you can make it. Where is my father? Why isn't he with you? Ma Bao, all lives are destined. You saved me in Yongxing City. I'm repaying you now. The Ma Biao that you know... Just let him go. Your Highness, hand over the treasure map. I'll spare you and the prince. You dared to sneak up on me? How am I a bandit if I don't sneak up on you? Let me end your life then. Where is Madam? Zhu You? How do you know my name? You left the palace in a rush that year. I heard that your mother was alone and uncared for. For fear that my men will hurt an innocent lady, I had her taken to the palace to do laundry in my quarters. My mother is still alive? Go and visit her. Your Highness, you're in danger. I can't leave. I've always thought that I was useless. It was until I met Liu'an. He got me running again. And I could run fast again. That's why I'm always the one carrying the flag. Liu'an said that as long as we uphold integrity, we'll be the best escort group. That makes us the best bodyguards. General Ma, I have a favor to ask of you. Please do tell, Your Highness. The soldiers' greatest wish is to become civilians again. Aren't wars supposed to bring peace? General Ma, please give them the chance to be civilians again. The happiest life is the one away from all wars. I, Yang Liu'an, am just a warrior. I'm not interested in power and fortune. I just want you to remember the promise you have made and offer the people a peaceful life. Don't forget my brothers who sacrificed for you. - Liu'an, we're here! - We're here! Liu'an, we are the best bodyguards! Liu'an, we're the bravest escort group! Yes! The bravest escort group! My brothers, let's go home. Your Highness, no one must find out where you reside. Chief Yang. Let's end our grievances with this arrow. It's time to part our ways. YANGDONGJI TEA HOUSE - Catch it! - Catch it! - Catch it! - Peck it! Chase it! Hit it! TOBACCO STALL Are you all right? That's so scary! This way! Come on. Come on. - Well done! - Well done! - Well done! - Well done! - Well done! - Well done! Everybody, don't worry. As long as I'm here, I will keep everyone in Xiasi Town safe forever!
