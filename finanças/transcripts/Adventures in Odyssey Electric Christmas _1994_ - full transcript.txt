Jesse, are you sure it's along here? Yeah, I think so. We've been walking for hours. Dylan, we've only been gone a few minutes. But those were shopping minutes, Jess. They're like dog years. Every minute you spend shopping is like seven minutes in real time. Huh? You see that? Everyone's so pushy and greedy. People ought to be home, thinking about the real meaning of Christmas. Excuse me. I'm trying to raise money for camp. Would you like to buy.. Uh, no, thanks. But you didn't let me tell you what.. I'm sorry. We're in a hurry. See what I mean? He might be nice, but you never know. What if he's lying about camp and just wants to sell you something you don't need? There it is. What do you think? Oh, man! Pretty cool, huh? Dad's really been hinting about.. An XR-7 Limited Edition Speedster... No, it's an 8501 Cordless.. With optional Quartz-Halogen Headlamp, Dylan, are you okay? Dylan? Dylan? Titanium frame and hubs, full suspension front and rear.. Dual-chain drive for extra torque. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is absolutely... The finest bicycle in the world. And who else to demonstrate its magnificence... Than the greatest stuntman alive today, Dylan "The Amazing Dynamo" Taylor! Tonight, as promised, the Amazing Dynamo... Will propel his XR-7 up this steep ramp, high into the air, over the sleigh. Over Dasher and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen. Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen! A span of over 50 feet. Yes, it's amazing. And what about those razor-sharp antlers, My Friends? Only this man. Only this machine. Are you ready, Dynamo? The Ama-zing... Dynamo! Hey! Hey! Harding. Hey, Taylor. What do you think of my new wheels? Oh. Nice. "Nice"? Ha! I'm gonna rule the streets with this machine. How ya payin' for this, Young Feller? Well, uh, I think I'll just put it on layaway for now. Eh? Layaway! You can hold it for me, right? Oh! Maybe. I'll need $75. Seventy-five.. Yeah. Well, uh, I'll just need a couple of days. Eh? Trays? Days. I'll be back in a couple of days. Oh. Suit yourself. Can't promise it won't sell, though. Don't even think about it, Taylor. Boy, Dylan, looking at that bike that way, You almost look greedy. Me? Huh! Why would I ever want a bike like that? Come on, Sherman. I think he oughta play one of the camels. They're always lying down. Gettin' kinda old for dollhouses, aren't ya, Taylor? I can't believe this guy lives next door. It's a manger scene, Harding. Oh, it's mangy, all right. Most people would rather decorate for Christmas. Still ridin' the clunker, huh? Hey, no sweat. Three more days, and I'm the only guy in odyssey with an XR-7. I might not even let you touch it. Come on, Dylan. We've got a lot to do. Ooh! A lot to do! Happy hollerdays! Wait a minute, Dylan. Let me get this straight. All that money just for one bicycle? Not just a bicycle, Dad. An XR-7 Speedster. Limited Edition with a.. Here you go, Folks. Four Christmas specials. Thanks, Whit. My pleasure. It's for a great cause. Uh, did you pick out a name, Dylan? Uh, sure. "Matt Williamson." Good. We'll be delivering his present next Friday. Oops. Gotta go. Heh-heh. Enjoy. Bye, Mr. Whittaker. Bye. So what do you think? Mm. The mint flavor's delicious. No. About the XR-7. That's a lot of money for a gift, Dylan. Dad.. On our own, I don't think your mother and I can afford it. May I have your attention, please? I want to thank you all for coming to "Angel Tree Night" at Whit's End. A lot of children, whose parents are in prison, will have a real present to open for Christmas thanks to your generosity.

Hey, what's wrong about wanting a bike? I don't know. You're the one who was making such a big deal about people being greedy. She's right. One cordless shaver. It's all yours. Thanks. Banks? Sorry, I'm all out. Uh.. Uh, I guess you still haven't sold the XR-7? Oh! My goodness! Forgot to do this after the phone call. You! That was mine, Taylor! Uh, I-I didn't buy it! I oughta take those scrawny little arms of yours... It wasn't me! And twist them into a pretzel around your head! I-I didn't do it! Honest! Okay, okay, let's simmer down here. He didn't buy that bike, Young Feller. Well, then, who? Good day, Mr. Peterson, Children. Ah, Mrs. Harcourt. Didn't expect you so soon. No one ever does. Doves? Sorry. Gotta get those at the pet store. Yes, I've been there. Please see to it that these are displayed prominently. Right! Glad to do it. Good-bye, Mr. Peterson, Children. Good-bye, Mrs. Harcourt. Uh, don't forget to wear a helmet. What's she gonna.. Why'd she.. "The Spirit of Christmas Yard Decoration Contest. "Judging to be held Christmas Eve. XR-7 bicycle, grand prize." It's a contest? And the winner gets the bike? Yup. Gotta capture the true spirit of Christmas. There. That oughta do it. What do you think? Uh, let's take a look. Pretty good, huh? Well, with some paint it might look pretty good. What do you think, Sherman? What is it, Boy? Whoa! What's goin' on? Uh, we're gonna need some lights. Uh, make sure eugene gets that name and address, Mrs. Wilkins. We're keeping track of everything on his computer. Hi, Mr. Whittaker. Hi, Eugene. Hello, Dylan. You here to drop off your gift? Uh, actually, I've.. I've been too busy to buy it yet. Oh. Well, Christmas can get pretty hectic. So, what can I do for you, Son? We used to have a ton of old Christmas lights that someone donated. I guess they thought Whit's End oughta look like a casino at Christmas. Of course, I prefer.. Ah! Here we go! Wow! There. There oughta be something here you can use. Can I take the whole box? Uh, well, I suppose so. Uh, I, um.. Great! I'll go get my wagon! Eat your heart out, Taylor. What've you been eatin', Doug? Sauerkraut. Secret family recipe. You want some? Uh, no, thanks. I've got work to do. Gonna brighten up your little doll house, huh? Maybe. Well, I bet it'll look real... Cute. I don't think you read the poster, Doug. See this? "The Spirit of Christmas." That's what's gonna win. Not a bunch of big dinosaurs and palm trees. You don't get it, do ya, Taylor? Big is what Christmas is all about. You've got this great big guy in a red suit. And where is he? He's flying around way up in the sky. That's big! And what do people want to see when they're out looking around at Christmas? Are they driving by Whit's End to look at some crummy candles in the window? No! They want to see running lights, spinning candy canes and giant talking snowmen! People don't care how Christmas got started, Taylor. What they like is how it's turned out: Big. That makes you the big loser, Pal. The grand prize... Is mine. Uh, I.. I gotta go. Let me know if you need any help untangling those lights. No, thanks. I-I can handle it just fine. Hey, Harding, check this out. Well, I guess it's my turn. That's the difference between us, Taylor: I think big. And wait'll I launch this puppy! Bring on the bike! I want my XR-7! Hey, Champ, what's goin' on? Uh, just workin' on the decorations. Yeah? Hey, can you believe Doug's yard with those snow dinosaurs? Everything's so, uh.. Big? Yeah, well, Maybe not by tomorrow afternoon. Huh. That'll do it. What do you mean? It's supposed to warm up. Poor old Doug's liable to have a minor meltdown before the judges show up tomorrow night. Oh, no! No, no! Oh, man! What's the matter with the king, Doug? He looks real bad. Keep talkin', Pinhead, and you' be lookin' real bad. Ahh! Hey! Give it back, Harding. Actually, I think I might need a few more of those. Yeah? Well, my dad' real stingy with his lumber. Oh, and he wasn't real happy... About you tacking these lousy lights on his fence either. Aaaah! Oh, Dad! Doug wants to know if he can borrow some lumber! This is war, Taylor! You hear me? War! Has anyone seen my sandals? Uh, excuse me. Hey, where's your costume? Uh, I'm doing something different. But you guys look great! Dylan, I know this decoration thing is just for kids, but... If you want my advice, I think your competition with doug has gotten out of hand. Oh... No, dad, really. We're just havin' fun, that's all. I'll get it! Uh.. Hello? Hi, Dylan. Oh, uh.. Hi, Mr. Whittaker. We still don't have your Angel Tree Present and, uh, we're delivering tonight. Uh.. You forgot, didn't you? No! Uh, yeah, kinda. But I can get it after the judging. Well, I think we just better get it ourselves. I'm really disappointed. Good-bye. Oh, great. What else can go wrong? Time to pay Mr. Smarty-pants a little visit. And this next entry is entitled, "A recycling christmas." Reminding us all to have an environmentally safe... And pollution-free holiday. Okay, Sherman, right here, yeah. Just wait'll they get a load of our show. Very well, everyone. We are approaching the final two houses in the competition: The Taylors and the Hardings. Whoa, Sherman. I mean, Rudolph. Okay, this looks good, really. Trust me. Ooh! Okay, Rudolph, let's go! Whoa! Merry Christmas! Whoa, Boy! Yeow! Oof! Are you okay, Son? Yeah, I think so. Whoa! (Muffled) Dylan, jump out! Uhh! ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ All is bright ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender and mild ♪ Sleep in heavenly ♪ Peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly ♪ Peace ♪ And the judges agree unanimously. There is no display that more perfectly captures... The true spirit of Christmas than yours. Congratulations, Jesse. And now, we have cookies and hot chocolate for everyone. Hi, Dylan. Oh, hi, Jess. Congratulations. Thanks. But what would I want with a silly old XR-7 Speedster? Here. What? A-after all I did? No way. I-I don't deserve it. Yeah, I know. But isn't that what Christmas is all about? I mean, God gave us the perfect gift. His son. Even though we don't deserve it. We just have to accept it. Look! If you two don't want this bike, I'd be glad to take it off your hands. I could even use that shiny, new helmet. Helmet! Jesse, what time is it? (Whispering) Tell mom and dad! Hey, what's gotten into him? The true spirit of Christmas. Who's next, Eugene? Uh, Matt Williamson. He wanted a bike helmet. Hmm. Too bad they're sold out. I guess this will have to do. Mr. Whittaker, wait! Well, I'll be. I'm not too late, am I? I got the present! So you have. Second house on the left. Do you think he'll mind if it's not wrapped? No, I don't think he'll mind at all. You! Uh, hi. Are you Matt Williamson? Yeah. Look, I'm, you know, sorry about the other day. I guess I was kinda rude. It's okay. You didn't know me or anything. Um, I'm helping deliver presents from Whit's End... For a special program called Angel Tree. And, well, I.. We didn't have time to wrap this but... Here. This is for you. Wow! This is mine? Thanks! Thanks a lot! And, uh, this too. Oh, man! I can't believe it! A brand new bike? I've never had a brand new..
