This is interrogation room one where we see beyond the lies and coverups, searching for truth and putting criminals behind bars. I used to think that if I did enough good in this world, nothing bad would happen to me, that if I locked up the bad guys, I could stave off all the horrible tragedies we see every day. I can't stop it. The following images provide a glimpse into my world. Chrissy, I'm District Attorney, Ann Walker and this is Detective Daniels. How are you feeling? I feel pretty good. Why am I here, am I in trouble? No sweetie, not at all. The hospital reported, they think you're being physically abused and we wanna find out who did it. It's not true. Yeah, they shouldn't have said that. They're required by law to report any patient they think is a victim of abuse. Did someone hit you? No. The report said that you were hemorrhaging and if you hadn't have gotten in when you did, you might very well have died. Someone hit me when they tried to take my purse when I was getting out of the car. I didn't see their face. We checked the surveillance tapes in the parking lot at the time you said this happened. All it shows is you getting out of the car and passing out. No one hit you. You live with your father, correct? Yes. How would you describe your relationship with him? What do you mean? Do you two get along, no trouble between you? No. Dad loves me. He takes care of me. Chrissy, I'm home, I'm hungry and I'm beat. What's for dinner? Steak, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Good, I hope it's edible this time. Those idiots at the county have been a nightmare. I work with idiots. I made it just how you like it tonight. Did you pick up the battery for the remote control like I asked you to? I forgot, I'm sorry, I just got so caught up in cooking and studying for my test, I just, it slipped my mind, - dad, I'm sorry... - What do you think I asked you today, like three or four times? - Yes sir. - Yeah the game is on tonight. Yeah yeah yeah and why is it that I always end up having to yell at you to get anything done around here? - Sorry... - No! I'll get 'em as soon as I wake up in the morning. No, you won't pick it up! I will pick it up, just like I do at the office because you are worthless! Sorry, I'll try to be better. No, you won't try to be better! Don't cry! - Don't cry! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You make me sick. X-rays indicate a break in your arm in the wrist area. How long ago did this happen? About a year ago. I fell and landed on my wrist. We see these cases all the time, victims denying what's being done to them. It never ends well. Victims protect their loved ones to the point that it goes too far. Victims end up being permanently maimed or worse yet, killed. Tell us what's happening before it's too late. I promise, we'll protect you. It's not his fault, it's me, I never do anything right and he just gets frustrated. That's common for the victim to think they're to blame, but it's not true. Your father does this, doesn't he? Dad's just trying to make me better. If I tell you, he'll give up on me and kick me out. It's time to stop your father from hurting you. If he gets physical, you need to tell us. It's your father. I promise, he will not hurt you anymore if you only tell us he did this to you. No, I'm ready to leave. Who do you think you are speaking to my daughter? The hospital reported your daughter as a possible abuse victim. We brought her in to talk to us. And who are you exactly? District Attorney Walker. To be exact, I prosecute abusive bullies. Oh good for you. So what did Chrissy say? Nothing, she's too traumatized by you. Is she really? So you felt it was okay for you guys to stick your nose in my family's business. I don't want either of you speaking to Chrissy. You understand? Chrissy's 18, she can speak for herself. I have taken care of Chrissy for 18 years. I make decisions for her. Leave us alone. I'm warning you. You okay? You think Chrissy's got the stuff to stand up for herself? Maybe, I don't know. Just another fine day. Thank you, dad, for picking me up. So what happened in there? They just wanted to know how I got injured. And what did you tell them? I told them that I was robbed in a parking lot and it was the robber who hit me... That's good, that's really good. So everything's okay then? Um, they didn't believe me. They actually kept asking me questions about you. And you told them nothing, right? Right. Right, that's my good girl. Because if you tell them anything, you know what happens, don't you? - Yes, yes sir. - Okay? All right, let's go home. It's okay. How's the nose? It hurts a lot. Norman, we're gonna charge you with murder and attempted murder. That doesn't sound good. No, it doesn't. We know you stabbed crazy Billy and you killed Perry. What we don't know is, is why? Does self-defense count? 'Cause that's what it was. Well why don't you start from the beginning? We were sitting around the table, drinking. Billy, he's mad at me and hits me in the face with a vodka bottle. You're both stupid, you know that? I had this whole thing figured out. All we had to do was break into the office, steal the money box. Then sit on the money for a year, without spending any of it. So nobody would suspect us. Crazy Billy. What are you, some kind of psycho or something? No, I'm just Crazy Billy. Well I give up, why do they call you Crazy Billy? Because when I was a kid, I used to get so mad that I'd throw myself on the floor, just kicking and screaming. My aunt said, "Now ain't that crazy?" From then on, people just call me Crazy Billy. Okay. Well why don't you tell me what happened this morning. It was self-defense. Wait a minute, you stabbed Perry 30 times. How is that self-defense? Not self-defense, what happened to Perry. Self-defense on what happened to Norman. Norman? Well what about Norman? I hit Norman over the face with a vodka bottle. Well you got Perry's blood all over ya. I got my blood all over me. Well why don't you start from the beginning and tell me what happened? No, that was your plan, that wasn't our plan. I don't see why we couldn't spend a little. A little? You and Billy spent all your shares. Now you're broke. But not me, boys. I haven't spent one thin dime. Gonna need some of the money you got there, Perry. Oh yeah? Yeah, so am I. No. What are you doing, Norman? You're gonna kill Perry. Grab his arms! I grabbed the knife on the table, stabbed Billy and left. Perry's dead and you had the knife. So you're the one that stabbed him 30 times. Perry's dead? He was fine when I left. You expect me to believe you had nothing to do with Perry's death? Absolutely and we had the league championship this weekend. Billy must have done this and he's trying to blame me. I see. Well we're gonna hold you for a few days while we sort this out. What about the league championship? Okay, I was in the kitchen. I heard this ruckus going on in the dining room. So I went out in the dining room and by the time I get there, Norman is standing over Perry with a knife. Well then what happened? Well Norm comes at me with the knife so I pick up the vodka bottle by its neck and Norman stabbed me. I hit him across the face with the vodka bottle. Amazing how much damage can be done to a man's nose with a vodka bottle. He staggers back, plunges a knife into Perry's back and goes out the backdoor. That's it? That's it. All right, now you said Norman stabbed you. Where? Is that a garbage bag? Yeah. Wrapped around to keep the pressure on. Keeps the blood from oozing. I've had that as my laundry bag for two years. Guess I'm gonna have to get another one. Okay, I'm gonna call the EMT's. Nice, nice. You like that? Absolutely. Robert Jinx, you here to confess? Chrissy told me that she told you that she was robbed at a parking lot and you called her a liar. Hey, nobody calls my kid a liar, okay? Just do your damn job! So what do you got for me? Those stories Norman and Billy told you? They're both lying. Really? Fill me in please. Our forensics confirm that Billy used the bottle to hit Norman and Norman stabbed Perry. So we're nowhere. No, there's more. Perry was put in a choke hold and given the nature of the damage, it had to be a big fellow. Norman. Exactly and bruising on the arms indicates that someone else tightly held Perry's arms while he was being stabbed. Their statements tell us they were the only ones there. So they both killed him together. That is correct. So, they both came in and they both told different stories thinking that we couldn't prove which one did it. And they probably planned on dumping the body until a neighbor heard the ruckus and called the police. They concocted a story hoping to get out of it. You know the other day at church when the pastor spoke about leading by example, what kind of example do you think these guys had when they grew up? Honestly, I couldn't tell you. They could've come from loving families. Seems like more and more people are straying. What are these paintings on the wall? They're called icons, windows to Heaven. Those are glass into eternity and what awaits us. You a priest? I am Father Thomas Francis, the pastor of this church. Do you have a minute to talk with me? Certainly. Please. May I sit? Sure. What's your name? Elizabeth Waters. Very nice to meet you, Elizabeth. Are you a Catholic? No, I'm not religious. Do you believe in God? I don't know. That's not the reason I'm here. I just really need to talk to you. Okay, how can I help you? So, two years ago, I did something that has just ruined my life. I was at a party and on my way home, I was driving and I hit someone. This man stepped in front of my car and it happened so fast that I heard a thump, but I kept on driving. I was too afraid to stop and the next day on our news, I heard that there was a hit and run and that a homeless man, he was in critical condition. I think he died. Did you report it to the police? No, I was too scared. So now here I am. I used to be so happy, Father, but I just can't live with this guilt. I wish I never went to that party. I wish I, I wish, I hate my life, I hate me. I've thought of ending it all. No, Elizabeth, that's not the way out. God loves you. You, Elizabeth are very special to him. Do you know who Jesus is? Yes, I mean, I grew up in church. Well Jesus said, "Come to me, all you who are weary "and carry heavy burdens and I will give you rest." He loves you, Elizabeth. Why, why would God love me? I killed someone. Elizabeth, God came into the world and took on flesh and his name is Jesus. He was born of the blessed Virgin Mary, hung on a cross, died and on the third day, rose from the dead so that we may have eternal life. He even forgave those who killed him. He is the way, the truth and the life. If you want to free yourself from this guilt, you have to do the right thing. What would that be, turn myself in? I know you don't wanna face the consequences. I don't want to go to jail. Well, but the truth will set you free and you don't have to face the consequences, but I know you have to. Okay? I believe God brought you here for a reason. He wants you to know him and the love he has for you. He wants to grant you his mercy and healing. How? Ask him into your heart, your life. Be truly sorry for your sins. Believe in him and then follow him. May I say a little prayer and ask God to help you? All right. Can we hold hands? Heavenly Father, you know all things before we even ask and you said to ask and you shall receive. I bring before you Elizabeth, Lord, give her strength and courage to do what is right and most of all, Lord, open her heart that she may truly know you and experience your love. I ask this in the precious name of Jesus. Jesus. I'm sorry what I've done. Forgive me, please come into my life. I believe that you are God. Help me. Elizabeth, no matter what happens, know that God is in control and that all things work for good for those who love God and are called according to his purpose. I have a friend downtown. He's a detective, real nice guy and he can help you. I think you should go see him. Are you willing to do this? Yes. If you want, I'll go along to support you. I'd like that. Uncle Billy. Hey Devon, how are ya, buddy? Oh where's your grandmother? Um, she's coming, she's just slow. It's good to see you, buddy. Hey sis, you came downtown to see me? Yes, Devin had an appointment at Children's Hospital. I see. Hey buddy, you remember where that soda machine is? Tell me. Yesterday I picked Devin up to have him with me for a few days. Last night, I was pulling his t-shirt off to give him a shower, he winced. I took him to the doctor this morning and he sent us to Children's Hospital for X-rays. Turns out his shoulder was pulled out of the socket. Exams indicate abuse. How did this happen? Sissy has a new boyfriend. I believe they get drunk every night. Okay, I'll have him picked up. It's already done. Hospital called everyone. Child Protective Services? Of course. Well how did you take Devin? You. I promised them I would come straight to you and that I would have you call as soon as I got here. Devin had started to cry. They caved. Okay, I'll call. In the meantime, I'll get the D.A. to call a judge and get Devin placed in your custody. You know, I spent a lifetime putting trash like that away. I mean, I think, why does anybody deserve this? You have been doing this a long time. Don't you think it's time for a break? Yeah, it's not the same. Or maybe, maybe I'm not the same. Thank you, Uncle Billy. How would you like it if we stayed at Uncle Billy's tonight? Yes, I don't wanna go home. Uh, s'cuse me uh... Dr. Gordon. Uh, Dr. Gordon, eh, is the nurse around or... She's out to lunch, how may I help you? Uh, Chrissy Jinx, she's here? Dr. Carl's with here, he'll be out in just a moment. Oh, doctor. Hi, how's Chrissy? Not good, she's been beat up pretty bad. Well, can I see her? Considering the severity of the circumstance, she needs to rest. Has the District Attorney been here yet? I haven't seen her. Excuse me. Tell me. Doctor's in there now. How is she? She's awake. Can I see her? Five minutes. I'm going in alone. Thank you, Doctor. What'd you do wrong? What? You must have screwed up something big to end up here. What was it? Blew up half the house? Totaled the car? Gambled away the entire savings account? What? I, I put too much starch in his work clothes. Hm. You put too much starch in his work shirt and you end up here. Can you hear how insane this is? Would you expect me or Daniels to smack you for dropping a pen on the floor? No, but he's different than you are. Okay, he's under so much more stress. Why do you live each day expecting that from him? I know what you live with. Each day to be told you're useless or a waste of a human being. Each day beat down. That, you can't get anything right. That it's your fault. I know what it's like to tense up when that person walks through the door and to sit each morning hoping that today is a good day. I know. I am so scared. I don't know what to do. You have to get your life back. You have to tell him he doesn't have the right to hurt you. No one has that right. He'll hit me. He'll stop loving me. And then, I'll become nothing. Not if we back you up, put a restraining order in place, get you with a support group and put you on the path to getting your life back. Trust me, Chrissy. Can you do that? Detective Daniels and I, we'll be here for you. I'll be right back. Do you remember when you asked if Chrissy had the stuff? Mmhmm. Wake up Jenks. With pleasure. Hey. Saw you talking to that attorney woman. What'd you tell her? Nothing. That was a lot of nothing. You were my good little girl, weren't you? Help, help? Nobody cares, nobody can hear you, no one's gonna rescue you, so shut up! No more, no more! You have no right to hit me ever! All I've ever done was try to make you better! All I've ever done is try to please you and love you. All you've ever done is make me feel worthless. Because you are worthless! You're worthless! Don't come crawling back! I hate you! You're done, you are done! You wanted to move in with your mom. Oh, that's right, she abandoned you. She killed herself! At least she never had to put up with you again! You'll come crawling back. You'll be back. Good morning, Professor. I'm Detective Daniels and this District Attorney Walker. Good morning, Professor. Nice hair. Professor, one of your students is dead and you don't seem bothered by that. It was a tragic suicide, but I hardly knew the young man. Let's talk about the cheating going on by your students. Yeah, that is regretful. I knew nothing about it. Rest assured, I had planned on getting to the bottom of it. Thank you, Professor Russell. Keep us in the loop. You got it. What's with cutting him loose? I had a lot of questions for that guy. He's guilty. I just don't want him to believe we know that. Right, 'cause he'll start to intimidate his students and just cover his tracks. Exactly. Tommy! I mean, Father Tom. How are ya? Doing great, Billy. Have you been going to church? I sure have. Billy and I, we grew up together. So what brings you down to this neck of the woods? I want you to meet Elizabeth Waters. Hi. Well hello, Elizabeth Waters. Have a seat. Elizabeth had an accident about two years ago and she never reported it. Evidently a man stepped out in front of her car and she thinks she hit him. She was too scared to stop so she kept driving. I didn't do it on purpose. He came out of nowhere. I'm truly very sorry. Well, can you tell me the details as to when this happened? I was at a barbecue at my friend's house and it was the 4th of July and I was driving home around 11:00 p.m. Well this could be a serious situation, Elizabeth. Let me pull up the record, give me a second. Well according to the report, there was a hit and run in the evening of July the 4th two years ago. It also states that a injured, intoxicated, homeless man recovered and is now working at the city mission. So in order to close the case, I need to take your statement. He's not dead? Alive and well and working at the city mission. Is there anything you can do for her, Billy? Well I can talk to the D.A. The judge'll probably go easy on her since you don't have a criminal record. You might have to do some community service. Yeah. Well, young lady, let's go to the next room and record your statement. Thank you, Father Thomas. God is real and merciful. Amen. Ann Walker. You look so serious. Jovanna. Good to see you. It's been a while. Seven years. Have a seat. I was really sad to hear about David. Yeah, I'm still having a hard time accepting what happened. What did happen? We were hiking and enjoying the day. We got to the top of a trail, on a mountain. He wanted me to take his picture. He kept backing up. I told him to stop, but it was windy and I guess he didn't hear me. I screamed stop, but some ground gave way and he just fell away. Must have been tough going through the police investigation and all. Yes. He was a good person. You know, he called me a couple weeks ago. Oh really? Just to say hi, check in. Oh. I can remember your wedding like it was yesterday. You two always seemed so happy. Yeah, we were lucky. Were you still happy? Of course. Because that would have affected the course of the investigation. What are you implying? Gee, you're an attorney. You know what I'm implying. David told me that you two were unhappy and that he was taking this last trip with you to soften the blow of asking for a divorce. Every couple has their ups and down. He didn't ask for a divorce. Because you pushed him off a cliff before he could ask for one. It's all conjecture. We'll see how much is conjecture when I reopen the case and tear your life apart. David was the brother I never had. We grew up together and I will not stand by and let what was going to be his ex-wife get away with murder. Well, I had hoped this would have been a more pleasant visit, but I can see what you're really after. Guess we'll see. Am I the third wheel here? Yes. No. Does it give you a rush? What? The power, having someone's life hanging in the balance and you controlling which way it goes. You really love yourself, don't you? Focus here, Mr. Jenks. I wanna see my daughter. She's someplace safe. I wanna see my daughter! Relax, psycho. Psycho. I don't think I'd let anyone get away with that. Until now. We'll see, old man. Why don't you tell us about it? I wanna talk to Chrissy. Of course you do, but that's not going to happen. Chrissy will never testify against me. My daughter loves me. She loves you probably and she won't betray you. She doesn't have to. You betrayed yourself. How did I do that? Well not consciously, but you did. All the times you hurt her, all the breaks and the sprains, it all adds up. You're the only one living with her. It all points to you. And yet, it's all circumstantial. Not when Chrissy testifies. I don't need your confession. You're right. Power is a rush and I'm gonna enjoy leveraging it and controlling which way your life goes. Hm, you guys are all the same, read a couple fancy books and put on some cheap suits, very cheap suits. And you think you're special, but you're nothing, nothing! My daughter will never testify against me. Yes, she will. When I walk into that courtroom and Chrissy sees my face, I walk. Okay, we're done here. We are done here. What do you know about the murder of Christopher Nelson? Chris committed suicide. No. That's what they said. No he didn't and you know it. Your only option here is to tell me the truth. I don't know anything. Kyra, you had your chance and you blew it. You're under arrest. For murder? For obstruction of justice. You'll get a year in jail and there goes your life. What if I told you what I know? Or at least what they told me? I want everything. You've been told and if you hold anything back or you're lying to me I'll lock you up. There's a pad and a pen. Start writing. Yes sir. Mickey Young, long time no see. Christopher Nelson. So you're the private detective. Jay Wellington, Churchill Warren and Christopher Nelson, bunch of trust-fund babies. They paid me to investigate teachers and faculty at A.C. Prep. Well you didn't break any laws. Christopher Nelson's death, not what I signed up for. I'm done. Retiring for good. Integrity and class, you had it as a cop and you still have it. When I retired, the only reason I hung up a jingle was I wanted to still be a cop. Thank you for coming in, Mickey. I'm gonna take a few days after this. Let's go fishing. I've been thinking about a different type of fishing. What I've really been wanting to do is sit down and read the Bible. I think I need some reassurance after dealing with all of this. Maybe become a fisher of men. I like that, Mickey. You're Maddie North, teacher at A.C. Prep, correct? Was is more correct. I resigned. All I know is some students are blackmailing teachers. Did that have anything to do with your resignation? Is it true about the suicide? Well we're investigating that. Why don't you tell me how they were trying to get to you? I lied on my application. I said I graduated from Yale and that isn't true. Churchill found out about it and he told me that he and all of his little rich buddies wanted all A's and I knew it was just a matter of time before everyone else found out. So instead of going along with it, I resigned. Two days later, Christopher killed himself. That's all I know about that. My father's a minister and I confessed to him, told him what I did and he advised me to resign and spend some time on my knees getting some forgiveness. That's good advice. Thank you for coming in, Miss North. I know why I'm here. Why are you here? You think I had something to do with Chris committing suicide. Well you were his roommate and you did find the body. We were roommates, yes, but we never really had anything to do with each other. Nothing at all? I'm a scholarship kid. My parents don't have money. A small group of us are in a Bible study group and we are pretty much outsiders. We know you investigated teachers and faculty and we know you used blackmail and extortion to get A's. Do we need an attorney? Yes, you do. Do you want one? No, we don't believe Chris' death was a suicide. Correct, it wasn't. We never thought it would come to this. We think we know who did it. Let's have it. We knew that Professor Russell was unfaithful to his wife so we squeezed him. So you think Russell killed him? Probably Clive Barker did it. We're pretty sure. He's Professor Russell's graduate assistant. Well how does Russell fit in this? Clive will do whatever the professor wants. You know you boys are still in trouble for blackmail. Yeah, we're going to jail, aren't we? No, your parents are rich. Their lawyers will probably keep you out of jail. I did it. I killed Christopher Nelson. I made it look like a suicide. Why are you confessing like this? I just wanna get it over with. Professor Russell came to me and talked me into it. Then he started talking about me killing the other two and I said, "No!" He threatened to turn me in for murder and claim he knew nothing if I didn't kill the other two. You got any proof? I have every conversation recorded on my class recorder. You got it with ya? Absolutely. Well let's have it. I'm gonna need to keep this. Fine by me. Hey Ann. Goldie, come in. How's Devin? Better. Bill's taking him to the zoo. And what's the latest? I have custody for now. It's looking like Sissy will lose custody of Devin permanently. My lawyer says that either myself or my son, Frank, needs to adopt Devin to guarantee custody. Frank wants him and I said yes. Devin likes both of his cousins so he's okay with it. Sissy's boyfriend has been convicted of child abuse in the past. He'll go away for a long time. And Sissy? Six months in jail, five years probation. Where did it all go wrong? I should have tried harder. Alcohol. Sissy's gonna need you now more than ever. I'll be there. You've been snooping around my students and Clive. What, no flirting? We got it all. You're under arrest for murder. I never came near Christopher's room. I can prove it. You had Clive do it for you. Really? And how are you gonna prove I did that? Clive recorded it all. You wanna hear it? No, it's not necessary. What about those boys and what they did to me? They didn't conspire to murder anyone, you did. If you'd only come to us instead of killing Christopher. 20 years from now, you'll still be asking yourself, "Why did I do this and was it worth it?" It's funny what you're capable of, isn't it? Excuse me, boss. Ben Barnes is here to see you. He said he talked with you this morning? Yes. The newspaper reporter. Not newspapers, magazine articles. Right. Now tell me again why you're here? Curiosity. I thought my readers might wanna see what goes on in the District Attorney's office. In what way? Cases that you're working on. Murderers, rapists, robbers and con artists? I'm sure there's no shortage of them. Any really unusual or intriguing cases, stories, something that would make my readers want more? It's not protocol to discuss open cases. Keep the names out, just the stories. What are you really looking for, Mr. Barnes? Nothing specific, just any cases that tweak your interest on a personal basis. Sorry Mr. Barnes, I think you'll have to go to another source for inspiration. Well, I appreciate your time. Good luck to you. Evening. Evening. Who was that? Someone I don't trust. I think we need to take a closer look at him. Why? He came in out of the blue asking about my cases. Who do you think he's linked to? No idea. We're handling a lot right now. Okay. Write his name down. I'll have my people take a look at him. Hi Ace, you're early. Edie. I wish it was social. Unfortunately, it's business. I have something in the park I have to show you. Okay, sure. Is it okay? Well, we'll see. So I'm running with my dog this morning, you know, like I always do, right? She breaks away from me. She never does that. She comes on over to this area right here and starts scratching around. Looks like little tiny graves. Is that a cross? They're little bunnies. Their necks were broken. That's unbelievable. Edie, it gets worse. Yesterday, I saw Carrie and two of her friends playing right here. Carrie, my daughter? Look, I'm a policeman. I am duty bound to report this. You don't have to do that. Well actually, Edie, I do. Hey, Mr. Ben Barnes has written exactly one magazine article. I knew he wasn't legit. Anything else on him? He's living with an attorney named Jovanna West. That ring a bell? Looks like Christmas is coming early this year. We need to pick 'em both up. You got it. Are you arresting my daughter? She's 10. Excuse me? Look, I know these girls did a bad thing, but why all this? Don't you think this is a bit much? Mrs. James, acts of this nature are an indication of very disturbed behavior. If we ignore this, we could be creating a far worse situation in the future. We just wanna make sure the girls get the proper care that they need. Excuse me, who are you? This is child psychologist, Marsha Collins. She and I will be conducting the interviews with the girls. It's gonna be okay. Don't touch me! Really? You're under arrest. For what, asking questions? I haven't done anything illegal. Well, for starters, my favorite catch-all charge, obstruction of justice. We'll add the rest later. You're not talking your way out of this one. Jovanna's done either way. The only uncertainty here is you. Your loyalty to her will only result in a very long prison sentence. You were serious then? It is a murder, for real. Yes. Jovanna said her husband died of an accident and that you're trying to frame her for it. She asked me to try and find out what you had on her. Not good enough. You're not a convincing enough liar. Now come clean or you're going away for a long time. I'm caught up in something and now I'm going to go to jail for it? Well you're only chance is to talk to us. What do you wanna know? Everything. Where in the world have you two been? Just walking around. You're out walking around while there's still chores waiting to be done! I did the laundry and Jenny cleaned the kitchen. Take a look. The kitchen floor's filthy! Mop it! Jenny mopped it this morning! Well if it's so clean why don't you eat off of it? Dinner is served, you ingrates. Fine, we'll mop it. By the way, your 18th birthday is at the end of the month. You're gonna have to find a new place to live. Happy birthday. Jenny, you'll be getting a new brother and sister soon. It'll be okay. Mr. Mear, someone just came in that I need to talk to. Can I call you back? Chrissy. Great to see you. You look good. Thank you, I feel good. You must be Chrissy's aunt. Yes, I'm Mona Jenks. I got a call from the office saying I should come in and sign some paperwork. Yes we typed up your statements and just need you to sign them. I'm so sorry Chrissy had to endure this. I had no idea my brother was capable of this. Janet, can you come in here? Chrissy, Janet will take you to sign the papers. Okay. You expect me to believe that load? Load? What do you mean? Robert Jenks didn't just wake up one morning and decide to become an abusive psychopath. That's ingrained. It's genetic. That's years of escalating from one violent moment to the next. You can't sit here and expect me to believe you didn't see that. In fact, I'm sure you experienced it first hand, didn't you? I didn't. Come on, find some guts for your niece and at least tell me the truth. What'd he do, huh? Yell at you? - Throw things at you? - Stop. Kick you? Yes. All of the above and more. He hit me a lot. At first it was the getting mad and throwing things and then one day when he was six, he hit me when I went into his room. I was just looking at one of his toys. All I did was pick the toy up to look at it. That's why you live on the other side of the country, right, to get away from him? But you left your niece here to deal with him. You must think I'm horrible, but not anymore. I think you two should head into the conference room to chat. Did he tell you that you are worthless? Twist your arm so hard you couldn't breath? How did you know? Oh, Aunt Mona, you too? I'm sorry. I should never have left you here to suffer. I was so scared he was going to kill me, I ran as far away as I could. Stop. It's over. You don't have to explain. You know, I can't even remember being angry with him for what he did. I just remember telling myself that if I could just do better and make sure everything was perfect, then that day would be okay. It's going to feel strange making it through a day without worrying, but eventually, you'll regain yourself and I'll be there to help you if you want me to be there. Is there a church where you live? There's a beautiful little church I've been attending. I'd love to take you. I went with my friend to hers and really enjoyed it. The music was beautiful and so comforting. Chrissy, I became a Christian and it has brought peace into my life. I don't know what that's like. Peace. All I know is I wanna fill this hole that's inside of my heart. You'll have it. We'll go see my pastor as soon as we get home. Home, that's all I ever wanted. Where have you been? I have been waiting forever. All right, all right, I'm here now. Let's do this. Did you wash your hands? Yep. Good, okay, start with a teaspoon of that one. Good, now just a pinch of that. Jack, please promise me you won't leave me here by myself. Yeah, yeah, I promise. I'm serious. I have no intentions of leaving you here with her. Who are we going to try this on? I have an idea. Are you Detective Daniels? Yes, I am. My name is Watts, Moses Watts. I'm here to report, I killed my wife. Uh, Mr. Watts, are you any relation to Sara Watts of the District Attorney's office? Yes, she's my granddaughter. She's a lawyer and a Harvard graduate. Okay Mr. Watts, don't say anything more. Come with me in my office, please. Hey, you got here fast. How did he get here? Well he just uh, he came into the parking lot, asked me if I was Detective Daniels and told me he murdered his wife. My grandmother passed away last month. How old is he? He's 78. Well I told him not to say anything and called you. Thank you, Bill. He's an honorable man. Let's get to it, shall we? Yeah, absolutely. Poppy, Detective Daniels tells me you were saying you killed grammy. I did. Grammy had cancer. She died in her sleep, right? She was in so much pain. She wanted to die. She asked me to get a morphine bottle and set it next to the bed, with a glass of her favorite wine. I told her I love her, couldn't, but she begged me. I couldn't say no. I did what she asked. Did you help her take the pills? No, I took the bottle, set it on the end table along with a glass of Chablis. She asked me to go to the kitchen, pour me a glass and wait until she called me. I did what she asked. She called for me and I took my glass with me and sat on a chair next to the bed, sipped my wine. She said she loved me, closed her eyes and went to sleep. Oh Poppy, that must have been very difficult. You're not mad at me? I thought you would hate me. No Poppy, I don't hate you. Mr. Watts, let your granddaughter take you home. I broke the law. I helped her to end her life. She never told you her intentions. A good lawyer will just argue she was taking a normal dose. Go home, Mr. Watts. He's right, I don't see 12 people on a jury convicting you. You did the right thing coming here. You reported it. What I did I know is not right in the laws of God or man. I knew what she was going to do. You think the Lord will forgive me? If you're truly repentant and you seem to be. Jack, fix me a drink, you know, the pink one I like in the evening. Absolutely. Coming right up. Yes ma'am, one pink drink just for you. Cory's here. Good afternoon, ladies. Who's hungry? I'll have a turkey with Cheddar wrap, please. Mmhmm. - Here you go. - Thank you Cora, didn't I ask you not to bring anymore of those brownies? I'm gonna gain 10 pounds just on brownies. You'll be fine, dear, just run an extra three miles in the morning. I'll have the ham and Swiss. And a brownie. Gimme two. I'll put it on your tab, ladies. Bye Cora. I don't like this at all. This is my case. I developed all the evidence, I should be the only one to question Gage. Of course I want you in on the questioning, but I need the first team in its entirety. That includes you, but also Daniels. He's the best we have. I don't agree. Look, I'm a lieutenant. He's been doing this for 40 years and he's still just a detective. Wrong, it's actually Captain Daniels. Don't, Ann. Captain what? Daniels has been getting promoted all along. That's why he's in charge of the interrogation unit. He outranks you. I don't get it. It's really simple, I don't want criminals I'm investigating to know I have any authority. You can take the lead here, I'll take second chair. All right, but three's too many in there. Fine, I'll just watch. Gage, you have been conning elderly people out of their retirement savings way too long. Well, I don't see it that way. I'm an investment advisor and it's perfectly legal. Then why is it I have over 200 complaints on my desk claiming that you've been conning them? Okay, I made some investments that didn't work out, but it's not illegal. I'm not Bernie Madoff. He just took people's money. I have invested every dime investors have given to me, every single dime. Correct, but losing money on paper. But I've traced the money coming out of the back door into the account of James Lester. I never heard of any James Lester. That's doesn't ring a bell? No, it doesn't ring a bell. James Lester's your real name. No, it's not. One in Pomona, California, served time for pulling the same con in Arizona. I know nothing about any bank account under the name of James Lester. Well don't worry about it, James Lester's broke. We seized all the money in the account this morning. What? No, you can't do that, you can't. We can and we did. We got it all, all 18,000,000. It's 18,249,000 to be exact. You are a miser. You took the money, but unlike other crooks, you never blew it. It was never about the money. It was about the con game. Yeah, well it looks like everyone will pretty much get all their money back. I think I'm gonna be sick. Do us a favor, wait 'til you get back to your cell. Nice work. Thanks, Captain. Can I go now? No you're gonna sit here and think about what you did and don't get my table dirty. What? I know I'm asking this a lot, but you okay? I'm tired. It's never gonna end. I feel like I'm in a tidal wave. The bad guys just keep coming. Are we making any difference? We are. Jack, this is D.A. Walker and I'm Detective Daniels and we're sorry for your loss. Thank you. You found any leads? Oh, it's too soon to tell. I'm sorry, but we need to ask you some questions. Absolutely, any way I can help. Where were you between the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. yesterday? Uh, I was at the movies with my sister, Jenny. Anyone who can verify that? Yeah, the girl behind the counter, Nicole. I spoke to her for a few minutes. Do you know anyone who might wanna hurt Edith? No. No. I sure hope you catch who did this. All right, stay close, we may need to ask you some more questions. Sure. If there's anything I can do, just let me know. Thank you. Hi Jenny, I'm Detective Daniels. Hi. Jenny, I'm sorry about Edith. Me too. I have to ask you a few questions. Were you at the movies with your brother at around 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. yesterday? Yeah. Did you hear anyone she got upset with or anyone that argued with her or yelled at her? No, but I spent a lot of time at my friend's house. Okay Jenny, thank you for answering a few questions and you can go back outside with your brother now. Oh, thank you for coming Agent Fisher. Thanks for the head's up. Yeah, this is our Russian translator, Josefina Hoffman. Ma'am. So, what do we have? Well that's Olga Azarov Lewis. She reported her husband missing. He's been gone about 36 hours. Any evidence she did something to him? Well we're still processing the house. We haven't found any witnesses to talk to. You won't. That's her lawyer, Mark Andreyev. He's a fun one, good luck. Hello, I'm Agent Fisher with INS. This is Officer Hoffman. You should be out looking for my husband, not sitting here questioning me. It's my understanding local law enforcement is doing that. All right, let's get this over with. How long were you married? 14 months. Were you happy? Yes. How happy? Happy as any other couple. Why did you wait so long to report your husband missing Mrs. Lewis? Sometimes he would go fishing or hunting and would be gone for a day. Usually he tells me, but this time, he just didn't. Your statement says you were home alone 'til you went to the store yesterday. No friends over, just you? Just me. Do you have any friends, Mrs. Lewis? No, not really. You know, it's hard to make friends when you are from another country. Your bracelet looks really unusual. Is that from Russia? Yes. Mrs. Lewis, would you mind rolling your sleeves up for me? Why does she need to do that? Curiosity. Your husband beat you, didn't he? Nope, she fell. She's clumsy. I guess we're done here. Don't leave town. Well, that went nowhere. Their little sidebar, she didn't wanna show her arms, but the lawyer said she'd looks suspicious if she didn't. He knew we're not gonna get anywhere with it. And he's correct, without a body or more evidence, we're done and her lawyer knows it. So, where are we? Will's with toxicology. He's a leading expert on naturally occurring poisons. Naturally occurring? Yes, this person must have a fairly strong understanding of herbs and flowers and what could be combined to create a poison. Okay so who are we looking for, a botanist? Maybe, but not necessarily. All the components can easily be found online. Even someone with no experience is capable of compounding a poison. We're almost done analyzing the components and we should have a report to you by the end of the day. Your victim was poisoned and beaten. The perp most likely didn't wanna wait on the herbs to do the job. Had to be someone with a whole lot of anger. Oh, and that partial print you wanted me to run, it wasn't a partial, it was a full fingerprint of a child, I'd say between nine and 12 years old. Interesting. I hope it's not who I'm thinking of. Kerry, do you know why you're here? No. We found some graves. Looks like bunnies were killed and buried. We found those. We didn't have anything to do with killing them. Okay, do you know who did? No. Okay. We're gonna have to talk to the other two. Are you sure this is all you wanna say? Yup. Okay, back outside. Do you know why you're here? Because of the bunny graves? Did you kill the bunnies? No, we just found the graves. We didn't do anything. You just found them? Okay, send in Maria. I know Kerry's the alpha. The what? The alpha, the leader of your little group. You seem like the reasonable one. Tell me what happened. We just found the graves. Did you dig one up? - Maybe. - Maybe? You did or you didn't. Yes. And what did you do with it once you dug it up? Buried it again. Do you know who killed the bunnies? No. Okay, Maria, wait outside please. You see what I see? They're a pretty tight group, got their stories all lining up. Should we do this as a group or each one? Group, but I think the focus needs to be put primarily on Kerry. Why don't you handle this round. Okay. Hi girls, my name is Dr. Collins. I know this is all a bit overwhelming so we'll try to keep it brief. Who can tell me who was the first one to find the graves? I did. And when was that? I don't know, maybe a couple weeks ago. And so you were showing the graves to Maria and Rosa? Yes. Why? I don't know, guess I thought it was cool. You didn't think to tell your parents about them? No, I know what goes on in the world, I can handle it. You seem like you're mature for your age. We have a witness that says you've been going back there for about two months. So a couple of weeks ago is not accurate. It's better you tell us now what happened rather than us piecing the puzzle together later. It was an initiation. Shut up! It's over, they're going to figure it out. She made us do it! Shut up, both of you! An initiation for what? To join the group, we each had to kill a bunny. I'm still having nightmares. There are five graves. How many people are in this group? Just us. So who killed the other two bunnies? Who put the cross on the grave? I did. Okay. I'll be talking with your parents next. Stay here. You can drop the innocent act. It took you long enough. I started to think that I would actually get away with it. Started thinking about who would be next. What happened? You're smart, real smart. You could've done anything. What kind of people do you think makes something of themselves in this world? The people like me or the kind that lives in big cities with rich parents? Why Edith? She took care of you. Yeah right, all she wanted was her monthly checks from the county so she could feed her drinking habit. Do you know what she's like when she starts drinking? Well what'd you beat her with? What makes you think I beat her? Beating someone is messy. I told you before, I don't like to get messy. Just like a cobra, fascinating to look at, but dangerous to be around. Funny, my brother says the same thing. - I got this. - Yeah. What's your name again? It's Nicole. Such a pretty name. Listen beautiful, uh, maybe we can go out sometime. Would you like that? Wow. I sure would. Yeah, so would I, but I have this problem, see. What problem is that? I'm gonna need to step our for a few minutes, you know, to make arrangements for our date. The problem is, if anybody finds out that I left before the movie was over, I could be in some big trouble. In trouble with who? Nevermind that. Can I count on you or not? Just in case anybody asks. I won't tell anyone, I promise. I'm gonna need more than that. Just if anybody asks about me being here, I need you to tell them, I need you to tell them that I was here through the whole movie. Sure, I can do that. Where would we go on the date? Oh, that's a surprise. I love surprises. I can see you're putting together all the pieces now. Jack left the theater mid-movie. He said he couldn't help himself, he had to see. And she wasn't dead so he beat her. She was getting there, but the dosage was too small. I guess he walked in on her trying to reach the phone. Well where is he? Not sure, maybe visiting our aunt in Tulsa. You don't have an aunt. Okay Jack, it's over, we got it all. You got anything to say? You don't have squat. I've got nothing to say. Well we know about Nicole, the young lady at the concession stand. She broke under pressure. She told us, you asked her to alibi you. So what'd you beat Edith with? A bat. How you feeling? I see we didn't give you a strong enough dose. Just so you have a complete understanding of what a wretched, selfish, uncaring, piece of meat you are, I'm gonna take a few minutes of my time with you. Oh that looks like it hurts. All those nights of being mean to us, saying cruel things to make Jenny cry? Oh, I'm sorry about that. Can't have the neighbors hearing your screams. Actually, I'm, I'm not sorry. This world is going to be a better place with you not in it. Oh and we know about the herbs too. So like I said, we got you. Then you know that I'm just a product of a really messed up society. Keep it the way it is and there will be plenty more like me. You'll just be stacking the bodies. Oh and I'm not 18 yet. Something wrong with one of the cases? You know I used to think that if I did enough good in this world nothing bad would happen to me, that if I locked up the bad guys, I could stave off all the horrible tragedies we see every day. I can't stop it. Now I realize the most important thing you can do is to spend time with the ones you love being grateful for every good moment you get. I see the same thing in you. You've never told me, but I know something drives you. You're like me, you live for the job, but don't let that be the only thing that you live for. So, you're retiring? From this. I'm gonna spend time with Devon, fishing. By the way, Jenks took the plea deal. Wait, who's gonna replace you? For we are not fighting against people made of flesh and blood, but against the evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against those mighty powers of darkness who rule this world and against the wicked spirits in the Heavenly realms.
