H-Help me! The Story of the Seven Rats. The first rat is a smiling rat. It stops dancing and flies in the sky. The second rat is a timid rat. It covers up its own feelings. The third rat is a rat with glasses. A luck-pusher with a big mouth. The fourth rat is a quiet rat. All is fine if it's fine. The fifth rat is a cheerful rat. Although it doesn't speak its true feelings. The sixth rat is a short-tempered rat. It flips out right away when it lacks self-confidence. The seventh rat is a little rat. It steals others' toys and laughs about it. Who is the last rat left? Come on, let's all dance together. Lah-la-la, lah-la-la, dance together. Lu-lu-le-la, lu-lu-le-la, dance together. Lah-la-la, lah-la-la, dance together. Lu-lu-le-la, lu-lu-le-la, dance together. Black Rat Asuka 49 Days Later Sorry for calling you so suddenly. Did you see the text? I got it too. What should we do? Who would do this? Hey, Kengo. Actually, I... It's about Asuka... I don't want to hear it. Kengo... Hey, Misato, I... Never mind. Please come to classroom 3B at midnight tonight. I'll be waiting. - Asuka Ryota! Hey, Takashi. You didn't send that text, did you? No way! Damn it... Then who the hell did? Wow, it's scary here at night. Now what? Are we really going to the classroom? Meow! We'll be in deep shit if someone finds us. It'll be fine. We've come all this way. Let's check it out. That text has to be a joke. Let's get out of here. If it's a joke, then I really can't let it slide. Let's go, Saki. Let's. Takashi! Yes? Where you going? Hurry up. Wait! Don't touch me, Takashi! But I'm scared. Hold on. Who sent this out anyway? Shut up, you fools! Cut it out, Kanako! You scared me... Huh? Where are Misato and Kengo? We haven't seen them yet. How long? Are they going to keep Asuka's desk like this? I still can't believe that Asuka's dead... And when I got the text today, I just looked at it like normal... Hey... W-Who do you think sent that out? Who knows. What do they want with us? What if it really is Asuka's ghost? Stop it! Knock it off! Sorry. Anyway, why are Kengo and Misato so late? Misato's parents are strict, so maybe that's why she couldn't come. But most people would after a text like that. Misato and Asuka were good friends too. People are different. Leave it alone. But... Seriously, shut up! I'm really sorry... What? Who are you? That's what Asuka made... The mask, right? I'm taking attendance. Attendance? Kengo Takashi Kanako Misato Ryota Saki Present. Who the hell are you? Say something! Okay, okay. What a scare. I don't care who you are. Can I leave now? Let's start the vengeance. Vengeance? What's this about? What is it? Isn't this... It's Kengo's. Who the hell is it? What is this? A virus? It's not working! You did this? Hey! I said say something! Kengo What does crossing it out mean? Hold on. Hold on. Hey, come on! Where are you going? Kengo? Hey, Kengo! Wake up! Come on, stop messing around! Kengo! Come on, wake up! I'm gonna kill all of you! Kill us? Squeak. What's with her? This way, Takashi! Takashi! Takashi! No! Don't come here! Why me? Stay away! Stay away! No! I can't stand pain! Please let me go... Let me go... No... I can't stand pain! No! 2009 Amahicho High Cultural Festival Modern version of the rat dance? Asuka thought it up. You know the traditional rat dance of Ta war a Shrine, right? The one we've been dancing since our childhood. It's about seven rats, just like there's seven of us. Since we know it so well, she thought it'd be nice with a modern twist. Right? It's our last school festival... ...80 why don't we make great memories together? Sounds like a hassle. I'm studying for the entrance exam. I can't dance... ...and I don't want to practice. Well, I'm in. Considering we'll all split up after graduation. Right? True. Let's do it! Yes! We'll do it! Here we go again... Yeah, let's do it! Ow... What did you just say? We can do it. We can do it. So... Asuka already started preparing for it. She wants us to dance with a rat mask on. Rat... It's my first time seeing it too, so I'm excited. Ta-da! You stayed up all night to make this, right? Isn't it amazing? It's great, Asuka! Kind of cute, huh? Yeah, definitely! I can't wear it with my glasses on! It's easy to dance in... Ow! Ow! It hurts! Stop! Over there! Who was that? What is this? Damn it... It's locked. It won't come off... It won't come off... Help me! I beg you! Let me go! Takashi... Takashi! No! Ow! Ow! Ow! Please stop! It hurts! Why are you doing this? Please let me go! We were friends, weren't we? What? Ever thought about your friends from the heart? It can't be that you're really... really Asuka? I'm sorry! It's because Ryota was dating Saki already. And I felt sorry for you... But he gets mad right away when I say stuff. I didn't want Ryota to hate me! People usually feel that way, right? Right? Penalty game! What? You're on the soccer team, right? A one-shot PK challenge. Penalty kick? I'm a phantom member! I'll forgive you if you stop a shot. A shot? I've never been in a match! There's no way! Screw up and it's over. Hell's One-Shot PK Challenge! (applause) Al right! You'll really forgive me if I stop this? It's a promise! Come on! All right! I'll stop it! Al right! All right... Al right... All right... Damn it! Asuka, I actually liked you a lot! So please... I beg you... I beg you... Rest in peace! Okay? Okay? What? No... No... No! No! I don't want to die! Please! Takashi! Go out through the hallway... She'll come down those stairs, so... When she does, then I... I can get away. Okay. Please... Please! What should I do? Kengo... What is this? Squeak! D-Don't freak me out. I don't know who you are, but stop joking around. Ever forgiven someone from the heart? What? Ever loved someone from the heart? Asuka? Are you talking about Asuka? Hey... Get back here! I don't know what you're thinking... ...but I have nothing to do with her. Don't drag me into your problems. What? What's in your hand? For your information... ...I won't lose to you! Hey... What? Stop... Stop! Stop it! Here's a penalty game! No... I'll forgive you if you get 100 points in karaoke. Karaoke? If you're tone-deaf, goodbye! Hell's Perfect-Karaoke Challenge! (applause) What are you doing? Hey! Hey. Wait up! Hey! Asuka Misato! The first rat is a smiling rat. It stops dancing and flies in the sky. The second rat is a timid rat. It covers up its own feelings. Asuka? The third rat is a rat with glasses. A luck-pusher... Love Girl Dream Girl Pushing my tired body by pushing myself. Once I'm on ground level, I should call. Why? Everybody, let's live for love. In this fragile, dissolute world... Hey... Jeez, read the mood... Weren't we going to practice the dance today? What are you guys doing? If we're gonna do it, let's get serious! I can't be bothered with that. We'll leave it to you, so just make it work. It only means something if we do it together. Misato, it's okay. We still have time. Let's start practicing tomorrow. Okay? Okay? I'm going home. Wait up, Ryota! Me too. Why? Why are you always smiling? It's creepy, so stop it. Everybody, let's live for love. A dream is a dream if you only see it. Of course we'll do our best, but we didn't put enough effort in. Everybody, let's live for love. A dream is a dream if you only see it. Darling, let's live the future together out of bed. It may not be too bad if it's the two of us. Scoring... Scoring... Stop... Stop... Stop it! I'm sorry, Asuka... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Please... Forgive me. Please! No... No! Help! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Wait up, Ryota! Who are you? Asuka... You still don't get it? It's too much. You're way too serious for me! You need... You need to get that already! Wait up! What should we do about the festival? It's too late, isn't it? You know that. Asuka's looking forward to it. It's inevitable. What are you going to do? About what? About Saki. Oh... You should clear things up with Asuka first. I'm beat. You know how she's always smiling? It's easier for me to be with Saki. Stay back! Stay back! I said to stay back! You killed yourself on your own... Don't come back now! Can't you just leave us alone? Why did you abandon me? Why didn't you save me? Are you pretending to be Asuka? No... You're not Asuka. What's your intention? Revenge? Penalty game for the powerless friend! You're definitely not her. Asuka wouldn't do such a thing. I don't care who you are! Here I come! I pity you... You don't actually know anything about Asuka. Shit! Ow! Kengo! Akane? Hey, Kengo, why are you still alive? Hey. Hey... Why are you dressed like that? No... No... Why... Stop... Stop! Stop! I'm trying to help you. Hey... Hey, wait, Kengo! What the hell... Did you kill Takashi and Kanako? No... Hey, shut up! Shit... Damn it! Hey... Hey, Kengo! Stay away! Stay away! Hey. Kengo... Kengo! The Story of the Seven Rats The first rat is a smiling rat. It stops dancing and flies in the sky. Lah-la-la, lah-la-la, dance together. You loved my younger sister, right? Why didn't you protect her? I said what I could... ...10 everyone. But... ...It was useless. Meaning even after all that... ...| couldn't do anything... ...for your younger sister, right? I'm going... ...after Asuka's revenge. You know this, right? The mask Asuka made. That day, ... ...she jumped off the roof wearing this. Kengo. Decide whether to help me or to be killed by me. Squeak. Help... H-Help me! I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Help... Help! Help... This is... This is for Takashi! This is for Kanako! Shit... Not yet... I'm not done yet! Get up! Come on! Ryota said that he can't stand me smiling. Saki and Kanako say that too. I don't know what to do... It's not like I'm always smiling happily. Aren't there times when you smile even if it's hard to? Sorry. You don't really get what I'm saying, do you, Kengo? I'm sorry, Asuka. Stop it! That hurt, damn it! It's me! Saki, it's over... Hey, Saki... Hey, hey, where are you going? No! No! Let me go! Ow... Saki, what... What are you doing? H-Hey, hey, where are you going? Where are you going? What the hell? Damn it... Who are you? Are you really Asuka? Stop it already... This is the worst! What are you doing? What timing. The school festival thing... It's pretty much a done deal, right? We don't need this anymore. Misato! Honestly, it was such a hassle... Sorry. Hey, Asuka. What? Don't you have something to say to me? No, I don't. Don't just smile all the time! Why didn't you dance with me then? Why'd you steal your friend's boyfriend? I'm sorry! It was all... "Friend's boyfriend?" Who are you? You're not Asuka? You're not a ghost? You're pretending to be Asuka, who's dead? What's wrong with you? Revenge or not, do you think it's okay to kill that many people? Don't hang on to the past! Look forward and move on! You're the one who tore us apart... I don't care! You really piss me off. Halfhearted bitch. Die, rat girl! Damn it! Hold it! Let it go! Take it off! Take it off! Who the hell are you? Take it off! Take it off! We were such good friends. We all wanted to dance together! Hey, Saki! I'm going home! Damn it... Asuka It's all my fault. I'm sorry, everyone. Asuka Saki Ryota Misato Kanako Takashi Kengo There was one last page in the notebook Asuka left. Hey, Misato... Am I still smiling? But that's... ...a secret between Asuka and me. Pushing my tired body by pushing myself. Worked hard on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Put on my headphones on the smelly subway. Losing sight of a hopeful future is difficult. The fluttering heart will be sent out to you. Once I'm on ground level, I should call. What should we do about tomorrow? Everybody, let's live for love. In this fragile, dissolute world, it's natural to work hard. But "good job" isn't said enough. "If you wish it, your dream will come true," is what the textbook thought... Darling, I want to melt with you and forget. Why should I go? Which way should I go? Do I have to go? I lost my days. But keep on searching for mine every day. Everybody, let's live for love. In this flowing, flickering world... ...If you can protect one precious thing, maybe it will change. "If you wish it, your dream will come true," was highlighted in the textbook. It's flickering. I know the truth. Everybody, let's live for love. A dream is a dream if you only see it. Darling, let's live the future together out of bed. It may not be too bad if it's the two of us.
