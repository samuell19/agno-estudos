Barrandov Film Studio presents Clown Ferdinand and the Rocket Coordinates: Alpha 5 CL-327 A rocket approaches the Earth from outer space. Spotted at 9:42 above the Rosario Islands. It's headed for the Blue Sea at an altitude of 20,000 metres. Its flying speed is 5,000 kilometres per minute. Attention! Attention! A rocket from outer space with unknown destination approaches our city. We're trying to establish contact with it. The population is urged to leave the city. Attention! Attention! The unknown rocket is still heading for the city. We urge all residents to seek shelter. Attention! Attention! The unknown rocket is still heading for the city. Leave the city! Such a day like today, it happens only very rarely. Such a day smells like an elderflower and chirps like a bird. Such a day you can hardly trace in a calendar. On such a day I'm especially happy and everything is going well for me. I get up early. It makes no sense to keep sleeping while the sun shines on my eyes. Then, exactly as today, my vintage gramophone record starts to spin at dawn. Such a day is very rare and it makes me smile again. Such a day, among all the days, I like perhaps the most. Such a day, such a day I like perhaps the most. - Oh, my dear Robert. - Good morning. Good morning to you. Just a moment. Here you go. Yes. Oh! The breakfast. The portion is a bit small. Good morning, my well-behaved Klingeling. Now you'll get your breakfast. Here you go. You'll like it again. Such a day is very rare and it makes me smile again. Such a day, among all the days, I like perhaps the most. Such a day, such a day, such a day, such a day, such a day... Stop dawdling, Ferdi. You have to perform in the theatre. I know that myself. The phone is ringing, Ferdi. I know. Stop bothering me. What's that? Ah, I see. - Here's Ferdi. I'm listening. - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? Where's the receiver? Hello? Ferdinand! Hello! Ferdi, come on! Yes, yes, yes. Hello! Hello! Hello, Ferdinand! Can you hear me? Hello! The theatre performance is cancelled for today. Everyone has left the city. The children won't be there. Are you listening, Ferdi? - Take care of courself. The rocket! - I'm informed. But why? They won't be there? Hello? No reception again. Hello, are you still there? Can you hear me? I need to ask you something. The children will certainly be there. Well, looks like somebody tried to trick me. I'm surprised. There's nobody around here. I'm very surprised. Ferdinand. Ferdinand. Ferdinand. Tralala. Tralala. Tralalala. Tralala. Tralala. Tralalala. Tralalalalalalalalalalalala. Tralala. Tralala. Tralalala. Ferdinand. Ferdinand. Ferdinand. - What are you doing here? Well? - Ah, Ferdinand. Will you conjure up an ice cream for me? Like you do in the theatre? Of course, like in the theatre. But how did you get here? I got lost, Ferdinand. Will you give me an ice cream, please? So you want ice cream? - Don't you want a doll? - I'd rather have vanilla ice cream. Come with me. They're already waiting for us. You see, it's sold out. We'll do theatre. Theatre. But I don't want to do theatre. I just... I know. You want ice cream. No, a doll. Dear children! What's that? The curtain! The curtain! Why is nobody here? I don't understand it. Hey! The curtain! What's that? Are there no musicians here either? Like this? Or like that? I don't know. No idea. When are you going to start? It's taking a long time. Dear children! Lights. Lights. Lights. Darn technology. Dear children! Well. Yes. Attention! Attention! An important announcement! The rocket approaches our city again. There is no reason for alarm. All inhabitants were brought to safety. The inhabitants are asked not to return to the city for the time being. Helenka! Helenka! Quick! Quick! There are three of them. Tell me, boys! Where are you coming from? I have a ticket for a merry trip with Clown Ferdinand. You're always so funny. That's my little brother. When does it start? Right now! Now! Attention! The rocket is now flying over the city. - The rocket is flying over the city. - Which rocket? Oh, it's nothing. Just a little rocket. Ping ping ping. A rocket. I also want to have a rocket. - You promised you'd be funny. - Yes, you promised. Yes, just wait. This will certainly be a merry trip. - Measured accurately. - Are you going to drive now? Yes, I will. Don't be afraid. - It's no so bad, the clothes will soon be... - ...dry? - Yes. - Ferdi ends up in the water. Ferdi is a bad driver. Darn. Darn it. Darn it. Don't listen to him, Robert is ill-mannered. He says "darn". Who did he learn that from? We'll ask him right now. No way. Stay there. Sit still and dry. - The parrot should tell me something. - Me too. He won't tell you anything. Come on, get inside. You too. Be quick. The parrot will sing for you. You'll have fun. Why should I sing? Why? Now, pay attention. Robert is going to sing beautifully now. - Why? - Why? Why? - Darn. I don't want to. - You shouldn't say "darn". You'd rather sing us a song. Come on. He sure curses a lot. And now we're about to begin, dear children. A little concert. A real concert. Yes, you'll be surprised. Sit down. You too. Remain quiet. What's the matter, Robert? Start singing! A little song. Once he's in tune... Ferdi, I'll stop now. I'm already hoarse. A pity. We're leaving soon, children. - So we're going on a trip after all. - Where are we going? It's a surprise. A nice surprise. Let me take a look outside. No, no, no. No way. Come on, sit down. I'll tell you a nice story. Ah, right. There it is. Here's the lock. Behind the seven mountains and the seven rivers... Yes, yes. The lock is made of precious crystal. And the matching key is on the bottom of the sea. And whoever finds the key and waves it around in the air three times, saying hocus-pocus... Darn. Stop it! Nothing happened. I'm doing it on purpose. Help! Help! Ferdinand, please do that again. It's fun. - Right, Robert? - It's terrible. Everything is spinning. My nerves are ruined. Now there's a surprise. A nice little surprise. - Ferdinand, where are we? - I don't know. Where did you take us? Drive on immediately. Do you hear me? Is anything wrong with you? That's strange. I'm surprised. I'm very surprised. Do you know anything about engines? No. Why? You! Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Klingeling! Come here! Come back! I can't believe it. Oh, it's you. Come here! Be careful! Careful! Keep a distance. Wait! Don't touch anything! Get your hands off that! There's no harm in it. You don't know that. What's that? Strange. Really strange. I'm surprised. I'm very surprised. Ah! Ferdie, there's danger. Robbers! Be careful! Don't touch anything! - Ferdinand, I want to have a car. - Yes, my child. You'll get a car. Come on! Listen, Jirka. If I had a rocket, I'd fly all the time. Ferdinand, give me a a rocket! Yes, yes. You'll get a rocket. Now come on! Ferdi! Robbers! Robbers! A robber! I take it all back. He's well-behaved. Well-behaved. This is going to be fun. Wow! Oh! Ah! And that one? What might that be? Helenka! You see? A balloon. A small balloon. Ferdinand! What's it? - That's not a balloon. It's the Earth. - I know that. It's the Earth. What else could it be? Why that? The Earth? Well, over there! - Where? It's impossible. - The ocean. Africa. Europe. America. I'm surprised. Strange. I'm very surprised. So we're not on Earth? But then where are we? - Let's go home. - But we don't want to yet. Don't talk back. We'll leave. Right now. Let's see. We'll manage. One, two, three, four. Ah, that's the right one. Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Where are you, Ferdinand? Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Answer us! Help me! Help me! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Oh, that tickles! - Come here, Ferdinand! - Did you hurt yourself? The clock! Ah, it's still working. Ferdinand! Yes. What's it? Ferdinand! Your umbrella! - I know. I know. - Just take a look, Ferdinand! But what is that about? - Say, Ferdinand! How do you do that? - What? Ah, just like that. Pay close attention! We'll do that once more. Like that! Here they are! A handful of candy. But I don't want any candy. I want chewing gum. - I know. - A big wagonload of chewing gum. You shall have it. - And I want pancakes. - You should have pancakes. - And I want... - You should have it. - I want... - Come on. Let's go home. Oh! Ferdi! Ferdi! That Robert! Oh! I will have a serious word with you. Just you wait, my friend! You're curious! Very curious! - That won't happen again. - Klingeling is back! Klingeling! Klingeling! Ferdi! There's a ghost! Ghosts don't exist. Why are you scaring the children? Well? Answer me! - Ferdi! - What's it? I'm scared. Yes, I know. Now you can't run away. Ferdinand! - Will you give us pancakes? - What? - There is... - Oh, come on. You and your ghost. Besides, there's something I wanted to ask you about, Robert. Do you know how to fly a rocket? A rocket? No. Ferdinand! Did you listen, Ferdinand? Yes. - I want... - I know. Macaroni. - No, pancakes. - Yes, pancakes. You'll soon get pancakes. Ferdi! The robber! - What's the matter? - What's wrong? - Are we having pancakes now? - Get inside quickly. Yes, yes. Pancakes. As many pancakes as you like. The key. Where's the key? Ah, there it is. Ferdi! Help me! Save me! Ferdi! I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! Ferdi! Help me! Ferdinand! Run to the left! To the left! Behind you, Ferdinand! Behind you! Be quick, Ferdinand! Now he's on your left. Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Ferdi! Ferdi! No, the other way. Quicker! Get down! Ferdi! Save me, Ferdi! Save me! Did Robert come back? Robert will be here soon. He'll be right back. It was just a little joke. And now I'm going to bake pancakes. Attention! Don't move! Sit still and pay attention! Ah! Just wait! Wait, my friend! I'm going to... Like this! Like this! You'll see. - He goes this way. - I know. Stay away from there! - Ricicios. - Ricinus? I don't have it. Don't twist your tongue, my boy. Fritz Fischer fished fresh fish. Fresh fish were fished... Well, I'll get that parrot. I know. What do you know? Ricicios. I speak German. Are you afraid? Of what? Go away! - Why do you keep chasing me? - Chasing me. And stop flickering at me like that. Ricicios. Don't paint! I speak German. German. German. German. Ch... like Charlston. Ferdi! Ferdinand! Quick! The pancakes! Oh! - Ferdi! Be careful! - Come quickly, Ferdinand! Ferdi! Quick! Quick! Hello! - Ferdi! I'm scared! I'm scared! - I know. Don't be so pushy! You'll scare the children! The pancakes! Josef! Be reasonable! Who's that? You want to know who that is? Who's that supposed to be? It's Joseph. Right, Josef? Ferdi! Let's leave! Well then, that's taken care of. Ferdinand, who's that Josef? Nothing. Nothing. It's just a little joke. Will you be quiet? Hello. Ferdinand! I'm scared. - No... - Why are you scared? Don't flutter around here like that and don't talk so loud. You're scaring the children. I know. Beautiful... Beautiful machine. How can you scare him like that, Robert? There you go, Josef. Hold it nice and tight. Now you have to go home like a good boy. - Go home. - Yes. - Is he evil? - No. When you think about it, screws can't be evil. Have you ever seen an evil machine? You will help us, won't you, my dear Josef? Say "run". Run. Say "spring". Spring. Josef, "dance". Charleston. Helenka! Be careful of the foam. Josef. We got away unscathed. Maybe the syringe isn't working anymore. I'm angry. I feel rage. I feel rage. Ra... ra... ra... It's beautiful. Beautiful. A beautiful rocket. - I give you the rocket as a gift. - The rocket? - The entire rocket? - The rocket parts. - Josef! - Yeah! We got a rocket. Oh, whatever. You're giving us the rocket as a gift? Josef! - But now I want... - I know. You always want something else. - If we have pancakes, you want... - Macaroni. There you go. I want to go back home. Back home. - Where's home? - Where's home? Say, don't you know where Station Street is? - There's this... - The underpass. - The underpass. - The underpass. - I don't know it. - But you know the Earth. Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and America. I don't know Erika. That's the sun. That's the Earth. And that's the moon. It's 384,400 kilometres from the Earth to the moon. How come I don't know that? I'm surprised. Maybe they didn't teach you that in school. What? Maybe I was absent from school. Station Street 28. That's where I live. That's where I live. I don't know it. The Earth. Europe. - I don't know it. - Josef! Josef knows nothing. We're from Europe. Yes. And the underpass. And the sunflowers. You must know them, Josef. Sunflower. I know it. The sun. Did you listen? He knows it. - Yes - Are we flying home now? The sun. Now he understand us. You're a smart boy. The... the sun! Josef! Turn back!! Quick! Turn back!! The heat! Do something! Heat! You don't know how to steer! Be carful! Don't touch it! I'm evil. I'm very evil. I feel rage. Ra... X... Y... Z... I feel ra... ra... ra... - What's he saying? - He surely wants to steer. Well, that would be better. Ferdinand, I don't think we'll ever come home. We certainly won't. I feel ra... ra... ra... X... Y... Z... I'm surprised. I'm surprised. There we go. I take no delight in it. I know. I know. I know. Just stop it! You know nothing, Josef. You're confusing everything. You fly with us to the sun. I said "sunflower." Josef. We want to go home. I got it. Josef! Look at this! This is a house. - Did you understand? - A house. - Houses. - Josef! Houses. Houses, Josef. And something like you. Machines. - Cars. - Look at this, Josef! And then there are living beings. Do you understand? And children. Many children. Oh dear, Josef. You have no idea how beautiful it is at our place. How beautiful it is at our place. I know. Living beings. I know them. Now he's got it. Come over here. Quick. He'll bring us home. He said that he knows living beings. On the planet Earth, there are pools, carousels, parks and playgrounds. There are also cars, bikes and trains. Blink dolls too! For bakers there are ovens, for fishers there are fishes in the river. And for washers washtubs. I'd like a pair of sneakers. You can go to the cinema there anytime. You always have a few pennies to buy chewing gum. The Earth is full of nice things and therefore it's a place where people like to live. I know all control switches. Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he's fond of children. Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he's our good friend. We're going to join him in the rocket, we make journeys far away from the Earth. Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he's fond of children. Ferdinand, Ferdinand, he's taking us back home. A lot of children are waiting to return to their songs, dogs, gramophones, airplanes, toys and trees. Ferdinand is taking us back home! Ferdinand, ta-pta-da-pta-da, Ferdinand, ta-pta-da-pta-da, Ferdinand, ta-pta-da-pta-da, Ferdinand, ta-pta-da-pta-da, home, ta-pta-da-pta-da, home, ta-pta-da-pta-da-tap! THE END
