KUROSAWA"S WAY Is that the national anthem? It's the music from Seven Samurai. I was president of the jury. I think it was... in 1990. The head of the Cannes Festival, Gilles Jacob, said to me... “We have to give Kurosawa a truly fitting welcome.” So he gathered lots of directors from all over the world. It was magnificent, because Kurosawa walked like a general past a line of young directors from all over the world, all standing at attention. He was like a general surveying his troops. I memorized two lines in Japanese that I can't remember now. It took me all afternoon to learn those two lines. I said those lines to Kurosawa about my respect and enthusiasm for this film Dreams, and my gratitude for his talent. Everyone loves you very, very, very much. He looked at me and started to laugh, because I think my Japanese was ridiculous. We will soon plunge into the collective hypnosis of your Dreams. Your Dreams will allow us all to dream with you. That's what I call cinema... and for that I thank you... That was 20 years ago. I know only one way to thank you: I will continue to make many films. He was a man of few words. He used simple words, which disconcerted listeners hungry for the concepts and analyses that he hated. When Cannes paid tribute to him in 1990, I'd been his interpreter for 10 years. I often felt helpless translating his words, which were like air: indispensable yet intangible. But when I subtitled the dialogue of his films, I admired its precision, its richness, its incredible aptness. In the 15 years I spent translating his interviews, press conferences, and films, he liked my concrete questions when I didn't understand an expression or situation. And this man of few words became a fabulous storyteller with a head full of images that he wanted to communicate to foreign audiences through me as representative and mediator. Interpreting is not just translating words. It's conveying the inexpressible from one culture to another. ! think he liked my work. So in his 1990 film Dreams, he wrote for me the role of the washerwoman who tells young Kurosawa in the film the way to meet Van Gogh and breaks info a laugh that this lively man liked a lot. Be careful, sir. He just got out of a lunatic asylum. He would have been 100 in 2010. He died 12 years before that, leaving behind 30 films. Like the young painter in Dreams, I wanted to follow in the tracks of the films of the man I called sensei... to grasp their profound necessity and the mark they left on contemporary cinema. And so I met with 11 filmmakers who were willing to tell me about their Kurosawa. I was working at the Cinémathèque. I tore up people's tickets. Henri Langlois said to me... “I know you're going to really love tonight's film.” When I finished work, I went into the theater and saw Rashomon. It was quite an experience. A cinematic experience. The narrative. The way of adding together what people so tritely call “flashbacks” but which weren't at all. It was one story overlapping with another, and another, etc., creating multiple points of view. At the end, we didn't know what was the truth, or if the truth even existed. That was my first experience of Kurosawa. Rashomon winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 greatly surprised him, not just because he knew nothing about the festival. He didn't even know the film had been shown there. This first international award for a Japanese film was welcome recognition for the master who, at the time, only knew the West through its literature, its painting, and its films. He was 41. Rashomon was his 11th film. His career had begun seven years earlier with a landmark film, Sanshiro Sugata, the story of the inventor of judo who turned a sporting practice into a method of self-knowledge. It was already the story of a man forging a way. The film was shot in 1943... during the war, when most films were political and financed by the government. Kurosawa was already interested in man and his inner life, and he managed to associate a sport with an inner quest. What's interesting is how the eyes of the onscreen spectators announce the fighters entering the frame. That seems very modern to me. You see the fight scene, two men fighting, then we cut to the spectators' faces. The fighters' movements continue in the spectators' eyes, with the focus constantly shifting back and forth. Come on! I also find it very touching that the most intense parts of this confrontation aren't shown by the wrestlers but by the spectators' reactions. And that's what I do constantly: I always focus on the reaction, not the action. He always swam against the tide. I'm struck by his solitude. His unique stature in the film world and his awareness of that made him a loner. I was always impressed by his determination and his quest for authenticity. He expressed himself in simple sentences, too simple to be axioms, but hard to forget when applied to his films. 'A film must be exciting or the public won't come.” 'An exciting film is a lively story with unforgettable characters.” The best example may be seen in his other emblematic film, Seven Samurai, released four years after Rashomon. When I was in high school and gradually becoming more passionate about cinema, anew print of Seven Samurai was screened in a huge theater, the kind from 30 years ago that you don't see today, where you might go see 2001. A Space Odyssey, with a curved screen. They were showing Seven Samurai. Though it was just a new print of an old film, the theater was packed. It was an amazing experience. Since the film lasted over three hours, a title came up that said “Intermission.” The audience was So engrossed at that point that an excited stirring began in the front row and moved back like a wave that flowed right over me and on toward the back. It was quite an experience. I wanted then to produce even a fraction of that reaction, and I still feel that way. That's what made me want to make films. I think Ikiru is a very good film. But if you ask me my favorite film in the world, Seven Samurai is the greatest of all. Whenever I make a film, whether it's an action film, a comedy, or a war film, I always go back to Seven Samurai. What I look at is the way Kurosawa uses the camera and how he directs his actors. I like to see how he makes every individual in a battle scene seem so striking. I study his methods and his editing. I often have my cinematographer watch Kurosawa's films. I also have my fight choreographer pay attention to the scenes of people falling from horses, the atmosphere of the fighting, the human and emotional dimension of those scenes. That's why I ask them to watch Seven Samurai. I like my cinematographer to observe how Kurosawa uses the long-focus lens in the action scenes. His use of that lens lends the action scenes a real sense of opposing forces... and momentum. It allows for a fuller expression of the atmosphere and a sense of dynamism and intensity. So I use Seven Samurai as a reference when making all my films, even one like Mission: Impossible. “Meticulous as a Demon, Audacious as an Angel” is the title of a book on Kurosawa that Tsukamoto brought me. Kurosawa knew that quotation, and it made him smile. It describes his approach perfectly: “Meticulous as a demon, audacious as an angel.” All those details and fine points really affect me. For example... when the bandits and looters appeared, I was struck by their battle gear, the parts of their armor, the shapes of their helmets. It was all very rigorously - I don't mean it was historically accurate. Everything had been very carefully chosen. I'd never seen a film like that. Of course, he had them wearing anachronistic outfits, but that was a deliberate choice. It reflected the anarchy of the time. In that time of warring states, you wore whatever you could find. It was a very fresh approach, but it had depth too. And he didn't add shots just to show it all off. That audacity really impressed me. Those things aren't the essence. They're simply details. But in them you could see the filmmaker's determination. “This is the real thing,” I thought. Take this village too? Take it! I don't think Kurosawa really liked violence, but when someone's slashed with a sword, the sounds are amazing! Viewers must have been surprised. Nowadays it's expected in period films, but he was probably the first to do it, and everyone was impressed and copied him. I think many of the conventions people follow today originated with him. There was a film I wanted to make but never managed to. The film was La moisson rouge by Dashiel Hammett, or Red Harvest in English. I realized there was something very similar... to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. I was friends with Sergio. I'd written Once Upon a Time in the West for him, so I knew him well, and I asked him... “What's this about A Fistful of Dollars? Your first successful western... was influenced by Red Harvest?” He said, “No, it's like this: Kurosawa said that Yojimbo was influenced by Red Harvest. So A Fistful of Dollars was influenced by Yojimbo, and therefore by Red Harvest.” So it was quite an odd little story. So you see how an idea from an American novel, an American thriller... can travel to Japan, then come back to Italy for a spaghetti western! That's how cinema is. It's made of interweaving influences that overcome distances, cancel out distances. For me, it's as if there were just one film called... “The Story of Cinema”! One of his sayings that was so simple as to be enigmatic was... “The more Japanese you are, the more universal you are.” I remember discussions when he'd say my logic was too Cartesian as I'd get lost trying to figure out the ambiguity in his very Japanese way of speaking. Like all Japanese people of his day, he was brought up on Western culture, but he was also a lover of Noh theater, Zen Buddhism, and Japanese literature. When he adapted Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, Gorky's The Lower Depths, or works by Shakespeare, he took this axiom to its limit: “The more you explore your own culture, the more you attain the universal.” He had an incredible knowledge... of the world of Noh theater... and the world of Kabuki. Later, much later, I went to the theater in Japan. Then I understood what he meant. And I saw... the ceremonial side... and the grandeur of emotions, like in Greek tragedy. Throne of Blood... is Macbeth, but it's also a very Japanese story. If you didn't know - If no one told you beforehand that it was Macbeth... if you saw the film without knowing, you'd think it was a completely Japanese story. I discovered different aspects of his work. I discovered the historical costume dramas, and recently I discovered the realist films, the detective films, the film about corruption in big Japanese industries. Cinema can be prophetic. And some of his films are very, very contemporary. They're realist films made in a Japan just coming out of World War Il, after the collapse, Hiroshima, and so on. So they're films that have a power... They're like bombs that never explode. It's like an explosive force, but the explosion is always put off till the next film. Ikiru (1952) Seven Samurai and Rashomon are masterpieces loved by all. But for me personally, High and Low is still my favorite film, if I had to choose just one. When Kurosawa took on the crime film genre, the result was a masterpiece. A crime film by Kurosawa can be so different. That really amazed me. I think it inspired or influenced my filmmaking a lot. That's a film I revisit from time to time. “A textbook film” sounds too formal. I's more powerful and stimulating than that. Look at the portrayal of the town as a space. Kurosawa excels in every area, but in portraying space he's the best director ever. Especially in High and Low... where the town itself becomes a character. The executive's house is on a hilltop, while the working classes live spread out below. It's masterful how this portrayal of space makes the town itself a character. The space itself creates the suspense as various incidents occur. My film Mother is an exact inversion of that setup. The whole village looks down on the house with the body. I realized that after the shoot. I found it surprising and interesting. I realized I could get that kind of inspiration or idea... from the great masters. I'd been inspired by that film, whether consciously or subconsciously, and realizing that later was a good feeling. Kurosawa was always looking for new forms in cinema, which he introduced naturally yet brilliantly. They can be found in films made today by directors who continue along that path. It would be sheer egomania to compare myself to him. I'm in the dark recesses of the underground, whereas he shines brilliantly at the apex of the sky. But if I had to say how he's influenced me, it was by showing that cinema was both entertainment and a place for experimentation. Seeing that coexistence or compatibility was what influenced me most. The contrast in his films between black and white is intense. I realized he really knew how to use lighting! I didn't research his methods. I just watched closely. That led me to use very strong contrast in my own films. That strong contrast has been an indispensable part of my style ever since the beginning. I can't stand flat images. That's what influenced me most. What I like most about his films - and ll like a lot - is that dynamism. I'm fascinated by Kurosawa's mise-en-scène, which is just staggering. Perhaps I dreamed of having that type of talent. And perhaps he was intrigued On the Set of Red Beard (1965) by how I could direct a little child with a camera and crew present. He told me about his trouble directing a child in a scene that was to last ten minutes. He cut it down to eight minutes, then seven, then six, and then cut it completely. I told him that was normal. “The child comes on the set, sees all the splendor, the horses and horsemen, your stature. He's overwhelmed and can't listen to you. The great distance he feels between you and himself stops him from acting.” In my films, everything's simple and modest. We have an old camera, a small crew. The child doesn't feel I'm anyone special, so he listens to me. I think that's the primary difference. If there's a power in our work, it comes from our limitations. His films are remarkable... because of the emotion that comes through. Despite all the gilt, costumes, and props, the character's innermost feelings are perceptible and dominate everything else. The setting becomes marginal. It's just to catch the audience's eye. His actors are really very exposed, as much as the children in my films. When I was 19 or 20, I went back and watched Kurosawa's films again and discovered something more profound in them. Those films are often seen... as simple action films, but they're much more than that. I discovered they had a lot to say about the meaning of life. That's why a film like Seven Samurai is so timeless and unforgettable. What he depicts in his films is really, in my opinion... the relationships that unite people. His films are filled with a profuse spirit of humanism. He's concerned with how human beings can find the will to persevere in the midst of suffering, war, and the struggle for survival, and the care and affection that emerge between people in the midst of all that. In Dodes ka-den, I love Roku-chan. The story is taken from Shugoro Yamamoto's wonderful novel, The Town Without Seasons. You feel his love for all the people in this neighborhood, especially Roku-chan, a mentally challenged boy who walks around imitating the sounds of an imaginary streetcar. He makes me cry. Roku-chan can do just one thing, but he puts all his heart into it. Kurosawa makes films, and so do I, with all my strength and all my soul, and it makes me cry. Right to the end he was questioning what cinema was. When we talked, he discovered the difficulty of translating one language into another. It interested him even more because in his films, the characters' words were his own words. He taught me that everything in a film matters, including the subtitles. Everything is about meticulousness and audacity. Absolutely everything matters. In a film, even a single shot can suddenly pierce the depths of your soul. All it takes is a single shot. And you surrender! That's how it differs from animation. Actors have presence, nuances, shadows. Those elements can imbue even a single shot with something you recognize as greatness. Watch too long without glimpsing it and it's probably a bad film, but see it and you instantly know: This film is special. Many of Kurosawa's films are like that. I watch one shot and that's it. “I surrender.” You have to watch such films on your knees. I've felt that way about his films many times. Dreams (1990) Right to the end he ran through his films in his head, always preparing the next one. He loved to tell of a certain Noh actor and of Tessai, a 19th-century painter, who, at 80, freed themselves from overly restrictive artistic traditions. He'd say, 'At 80 you become free.” His 28th film, Dreams, was made when he was 80. He felt free at last to play with cinema as he wished. Dreams, for example, is a magnificent film, and it's very, very free. It was when digital was starting, I think. Yes, it was his first time using digital. That's right, and he was very inspired in his use of it. He was like someone faced with a new language. Instead of standing back and saying, “No, I prefer the old style...” he dove into that new language with the intensity and curiosity of a young director. That's what the example of Kurosawa tells us: Go farther and farther... right to the end. I'm sure that it Kurosawa could make a film today, he'd do it in 3-D. Possibly. He would have filmed an everyday story, a normal story, but in 3-D... which would have made all the difference. He was someone who never stopped searching and experimenting and finding different ways to tell a story.
