[MUSIC PLAYING] -[INAUDIBLE], Hermes! There's a chariot coming! [MEN YELLING] -Hercules, son of Zeus! Leave him alone, I say. Come on! [MEN YELLING] -Leave him alone! Get moving! [INAUDIBLE] -Strange. I wouldn't have thought they were robbers. -Hercules, one day I'll be as strong as he is. -And now, run like the wind, my friend. [INAUDIBLE] is waiting for us. Ya! Ya! [MUSIC PLAYING] --[INAUDIBLE] Put your back into it, you good for nothing, [INAUDIBLE]. Move, I said! Take that! I said move! Put your back into it, I said! Get moving! [INAUDIBLE] over there. You, get in over here and help him! Move, I said! Pull! Pull, I said! You, [INAUDIBLE]! No, no water! Move, I said! -Ya! Ya! Ya! [CROWD CHATTERS] --[INAUDIBLE], there's a chariot coming up to the gate! -How many men in it? -There's only one. But his muscles are so big, he might as well be two! -You hear that, [INAUDIBLE]? -He's bigger that you and your belly put together. -Ah, stop it, will you? I'll go myself and get a good look at this colossus. -[INAUDIBLE]. Stop there. Stranger, tell me who you are. -I am Hercules of Thebes. --[INAUDIBLE] hasn't got an eagle eye, obviously. You're a powerful man, all right, but you're not Hercules. -Something tells me you've never seen him before in your life. [MEN YELLING] -Son of Zeus, no mistake. Hurry. Go tell Menistus. Run! -There's no sense using a whip on men who are too weak to move. -News of your great achievements has come to us with a merchant caravans that pass here, but none of ever dreamed that one day the gods would bring you here in person to [INAUDIBLE]. -Ignacious, my friend, I have come here to pay him my respects. -And give offerings for the peace of his soul? -What's that? [INAUDIBLE] have been dead for years. Didn't you know that? -This news will sadden the rest of my journey. Not only has [INAUDIBLE] lost a king, but a friend as well. -Do you intend to resume your journey at once? -Yes. As soon as the horses are rested. -You! Harness this chariot. -Many things have changed here since the time of my last visit. -The building of these walls, they saw, was the unfilled dream of King [INAUDIBLE]. His daughter, our queen, has had the work begun in his honor. -Cnidia? Why she was just a baby. -[LAUGHS]. Well. now the baby is grown up. -We must push the work ahead faster. The rainy season is almost here on the northern side of the wall should be finished before then. We should have at least a double the number of laborers on the eastern gate. -That will do. -My queen, we are mere trying to do the best we can to carry out your wishes, but if we continue to work at this pace we'll never be done. I'm afraid it will take many more slaves. -Well, that's up to you. I don't want these walls to become an obsession with me as they are with you. -Cnidia! Wait a moment. -Hercules of Thebes is in the city. -Menistus, what did he tell you? -He has reported to me that Hercules of Thebes is in the city now. -Hercules? But are they sure it's he? -Yes. -I think that's marvelous news. Hercules, after all these yeas. -He must have impressed you. -Menistus, Hercules was a friend of my father's. Now he's considered a friend of mine. Make all the arrangements for a great reception and feast in his honor. -I will. -Come, [INAUDIBLE]. [MEN CHATTER] -Menistus, with Hercules here, the rebellion might come to a head at any moment without warning. The rumors that have reached us about him give a cause for alarm. However, let's hope that he doesn't want to stay long with us. -And if he should want to? -To go against the wishes of the queen would be foolish of us. We shall obey her slightest whim. [MUSIC PLAYING] -The entertainment isn't giving you any pleasure, Hercules. What's the memory you find so tormenting? -Forgive me, Cnidia. I was just observing how many things have changed here. You father's counselors, Polonius, [INAUDIBLE], and wise old [INAUDIBLE]. -I regret to have to tell you that [INAUDIBLE] and wise old [INAUDIBLE] are both dead. Polonius is on a journey to a distant province. -So many friends lost in a short time. -For you, the years don't count, do they? When I was mourning for my father, the heavy burdens inseparable from the throne were too much. And so Menistus had to take measures which have relieved me of many responsibilities. Go on. [MUSIC PLAYING] -May the the light of the sacred fire brighten your thoughts and deeds, Hercules, son of Zeus. And yours, my queen. -If you are here, then my fire is not needed. [MUSIC PLAYING] [WOMEN SCREAM] -There's no use pursuing them. -[INAUDIBLE] lunatics. A pair of fanatics. -Go on with the feast. Come with me, Hercules. -If Hercules hadn't chance to be here, you know would reign as king of [INAUDIBLE]. -And this is the second attempt that has failed. We must make sure that the third one is successful. -Don't even try while Hercules is here. --[INAUDIBLE] might very well become is tomb. Oh, I know what you're thinking. But don't worry. Whatever misfortune does away with Hercules and Cnidia, the people will lay it at the door of those rebels [INAUDIBLE] and then we'll get away with our hands clean, [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hercules, don't look at me that way. I have long known that I have enemies. But I didn't think they'd go so far. -Why do you have enemies? -Do you like my city? It's quite changed, you know, since the time of you last visit. Look there, Hercules. [INAUDIBLE] is lying at your feet. When those walls surrounding it are finished, the city will be absolutely impregnable. -You still haven't answered my question, Cnidia. Why do you have enemies? -Not everyone can understand my efforts to protect them. At the cost of sacrifices. -What you mean is the sacrifice of the entire populous of [INAUDIBLE]. -Just as you say, Hercules. -Many sacrifices. It will transform my city into a fortress of security for my people. -The height of walls and their thickness and not enough to guarantee the security of a city. -You talk this way because you are Hercules, the invincible. But I am a woman, all alone. Without protection or love. Oh, Hercules, if you were my protection. If you would only stay. -The fate destined for me by the gods lies far away from here. -And the love of a queen. A woman's love. Isn't that able to keep you here? -We've been waiting for you, Menistus. We haven't received any order. -I already know the cause of your timidity. A man named Hercules. -They say he's not a mortal man like the rest of us. -After all, he's the son of Zeus. -The capital of the guard at the east gate saw him hold a stone block which 50 slaves couldn't handle. -And I'm supposed to count on you! And the future leaders of my kingdom. You're a clock of cowardly sheep. Get out! Get out, all of you! [MEN CHATTER] -Hercules is a terrifying opponent for anyone. He would be even for all four of the brothers of [INAUDIBLE]. -Yes, they're like wild beasts when aroused. If I could only set them on Hercules. --[INAUDIBLE] brothers have been expelled from [INAUDIBLE], as you well know. And matching brute force with force is useless. Hercules is not a man to be defeated with his own weapons. The dependable [INAUDIBLE] would put him in a state we can cope with. Then [INAUDIBLE] could do the rest. And the murder of Hercules would be attributed to the rebels instead. This young girl might be of great use to us. -Don't fool yourself. She's the daughter of the rebel [INAUDIBLE]. She dies tomorrow in the main square. -I know, but that doesn't prevent her from being of use to us in any event. -Forget her, I tell you. You can use this one. -I shall give you some herbs. You must burn them in his bedroom while Hercules is waiting there for [INAUDIBLE] to gather him into his embrace. Then it will be up to [INAUDIBLE]. It will be easy. Very easy. [GROANS] -Hercules, Hercules, wake up. -Who are you? -Daria is my name. A while ago I danced for your and queen, although, I admit, it hurt my conscience to do it. -I don't understand. -Your gaze is aimed too high for you to be aware of the misery which is inflicted on us mortals here. Menistus deliberated lied. The counselors of the old king have all been murdered. -They're all murdered, you say. I can't believe it. -You have to believe me, Hercules. Those two dancers were not just a pair of lunatics as Menistus told you, but they were rebels against his oppression and tyranny. -Does Cnidia know about this? -A great wall that you see rising around [INAUDIBLE] are being constructed with human blood and tears. -You haven't answered me. Does the queen know this? -The queen only knows of her own ambitions and Menistus is the man uses to realize whatever she wants. Come, hurry, hurry. That is [INAUDIBLE], an evil shadow of Menistus. -Why didn't you let me-- --[INAUDIBLE] right not to believe me, Hercules. But if you will come with me I can show you something that will convince you. -I'll come, but if this is a trap, you'll be sorry. --[INAUDIBLE] believes he can't be far away. You're to use any method to stop him. -We need him and all his brothers to do that. You can also use your weapons, but you must get him. --[GASPS] The other way, Hercules. --[SCOFFS] I'd like to see the four brothers in a free for all with Hercules. -You don't like the one who can't talk, I know that. But he's the strongest of the [INAUDIBLE] brothers. His fists are as powerful as a pair of sledgehammers. -You're right. [MEN GROAN] -Hercules, let's get away before they find us. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Quickly Hercules, the underground passage is this way. [INAUDIBLE] -[GASPS] Hercules! -Don't be afraid. -Look there. -What does this mean? -These are the mortal remains of the counselor who devoted his entire life to the service of good King [INAUDIBLE]. Callistus, you know him, didn't you? -Callistus. He was a wise man. -Do you believe me now, Hercules. -Of course I do. See this? It's an armband made of worthless metal. I give it to him. -Callistus was accused of high treason and condemned to die of starvation and thirst. He was one of my father's best friends. And on the other side of that door, [INAUDIBLE] is waiting for death to set him free. [LAUGHTER] -Come away, Hercules. Soon the jailer on duty will come down to make his rounds. Hurry, we must get out of here! -We can't leave him here. --[INAUDIBLE] doesn't need out help anymore. His whole world is contained within those bars. Come away. Hercules. [LAUGHTER] -And Polonius? -He's not on his way to a distant province as Menistus told you. Perhaps his ashes have been scattered to the winds. I don't know. -Why is that? Why? -To satisfy the ambition of man who is corrupt. -And the queen, was it she who gave the order to kill Polonius and Callistus? -Don't ask me what I have no way of knowing. But I can still show you something else, however. Come with me. Look here, Hercules. These poor people you see were once happy citizens of [INAUDIBLE]. Now they are slaves who are forced to build their own prison. For it is not through a desire for grandeur that they are building the walls surrounding the city, but only to permit that evil Menistus and his mercenary to raid the towns in the area and have a safe refuge to return to. -Hey you! Who are you? It's forbidden to come down here. -That man is the elephant keeper. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Don't move. [YELLING] -Hercules, watch out for the elephant! -[INAUDIBLE]. -Hercules! [ELEPHANTS SCREAM] -Stop! Back! Stay back! Stop. Turn around. Turn around. [INAUDIBLE] Stay back. Animals can always tell the difference between good and bad. You took a terrible risk. Hurry, let's get out of here. -Wait a minute. Why did you come to me? Why did you want me to see all this? -Tomorrow at high noon, my little sister [INAUDIBLE], will die in the square of sacrifice. -I'll ask the queen to save her. -Not even Cnidia can save her now. It is the law of [INAUDIBLE]. Hercules, they say you are a man of justice. Go there tomorrow and do whatever your heart tells you to do. -All right. I'll be there. -Oh, Hercules. Come on, [INAUDIBLE] palace garden through the passageway to your room. Hercules, may the gods protect you. [TRUMPETS SOUND] -People of [INAUDIBLE], by the royal will of Cnidia, our beloved sovereign, [INAUDIBLE] daughter of [INAUDIBLE], will be sacrificed according to the sacred law of [INAUDIBLE]. [CROWD YELLS] -Guards! [CROWD YELLS] --[INAUDIBLE] has confessed to the crimes of treason and rebellion. Oh, almighty gods, we pray that if it be your will to oppose the justice of mortal men, send your champion to overcome the three trials imposed by the law. -Don't be rash. We'll try to escape with her through the plane of [INAUDIBLE]. You two go and get everything ready as planned. Go on! -[INAUDIBLE] will be trapped. Any father would attempt to save his daughter. -You forget that Hercules is able to overcome the three trials. -But Hercules will not be here at late hour. The herbs will surely have that effect on him. -You're right, my lord. -I'm certain of it. -Where is Daria? -I thought she was with your attendants. -Hercules? Hercules, wake up. Wake up! -Hercules, queen of [INAUDIBLE] desires that your stay in [INAUDIBLE] be a pleasant one. Ask us what you like. We are here to be of service. -Accompany me to the queen. -She's not in the palace, but [INAUDIBLE] provide you with a worthy escort. -Escorts are given to guests of honor and prisoners. You say the queen is not in the palace. I'll go join in the square of sacrifices. What does this mean? -That you're a very important person, Hercules. [MEN YELL] -[INAUDIBLE] fools! Why didn't you stop him? -[INAUDIBLE]. --[INAUDIBLE], daughter of [INAUDIBLE], do you confess your crimes of treason and rebellion against [INAUDIBLE]? -I am guilty of rebellion. -It's incredible. [CROWD YELLS] -Listen to me! Listen [INAUDIBLE]! -Whosoever submits to the three trials will be given the time it takes for the flame of the torch to make contact with [INAUDIBLE]. At that point, justice will take it's course. [CROWD YELLS] -Without violence, power gets no satisfaction. [CROWD YELLS] -That girl must not die! My queen, this man-- -[INAUDIBLE] Menistus. According to [INAUDIBLE] law, only citizens of [INAUDIBLE] my submit to the trials to save anyone condemned to the vat. But you were once the best friend my father had. The torch will show you the first trial. I wish you luck, Hercules. -You must do it before the flame of the torch has a chance to reach the court. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Don't let it upset you, my queen. As the son of Zeus, Hercules couldn't have chosen a more appropriate end. [LION ROARS] [CROWD CHEERS] -The second trial. -Quickly, Hercules, quickly! [GROWLING] -Come on, [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE], turn the wheel! Hey, what's wrong? -The gears are blocked! -[INAUDIBLE]. Hurry! We have to tell Menistus. [CROWD CHEERS] -The third trial, Hercules. [CROWD CHEERS] -Surrender and I'll spare your life. [CROWD CHEERS] -[INAUDIBLE]. [WHISTLES] -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Don't do it, Menistus. He has overcome the three trials. It is the law. -Stop him! [CROWD CHEERS] -Menistus, you still have time to stop him before he reaches the gate to the city. --[INAUDIBLE] signal to close the gates! -Sound the signal! [TRUMPETS SOUND] [MEN YELLING] -After them! Show them no mercy! Everyone after them! -You're welcome to come with us, Hercules. -What do you mean? Who are you? -We're rebels. -Rebels? -Perhaps we're fighting for a lost cause, Hercules. -Hercules always fights for lost causes. I'll come with you. -Let's head back to camp, [INAUDIBLE]. [CROWD CHATTER] -Hermes, oh, my son. -[INAUDIBLE]. -They ran like so many rabbits. -They look happy. -Not entirely. As long as Cnidia and Menistus continue to rule, we won't permit any marriages to be performed. We don't want widows on our hands. --[INAUDIBLE], you old [INAUDIBLE]. Where are you? -[INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE], -Hey! -Ah, little turtle dove. -[LAUGHS] -Here's your old bear home again safe, and sound, and famished. -Oh, fine. All you think about is food, eh? -I'm hungry enough to eat a pair of oxen. -Just a moment. -Huh? -Let me see your hands. -What? -You march straight down to the river and wash them. -Oh, turtle dove. -Wash them. And be quick about it. -She's a woman with an iron will. [LAUGHTER] [CROWD CHATTER] --[GASPS] [INAUDIBLE], with you around a body's not safe for an instant. Stop playing with that axe, or I throw it in the river. I won't put up with it. And let this be warning to you once and for all, you hear? [LAUGHS] -Did you see that throw? You should me use that axe when I go hunting with Hercules. -My father says that Hercules is stronger than four teams of oxen [INAUDIBLE] to the same plow. I can hardly believe it. [INAUDIBLE], tell me about him. -Well, I can tell you that four teams of oxen are nothing compared to Hercules. I know, I'm a friend of his. I've helped him fight against wild beasts and monsters. And he owes a lot to the strength of these arms because I was the man who-- -Hmm, really mosquito? -Hercules! -I need your help again. That's why I'm here. -Hercules! [INAUDIBLE] is getting worse. [MOANING] -[INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE]. -Where am I? What am I doing here? Who are you? Let me die. I'm guilty. Let me die. I beg you. -Hush, hush. Calm yourself, [INAUDIBLE]. -Let me die! Let me die! -Hush. -Your daughter was facing death as happy as a bride on her wedding day. --[INAUDIBLE] and doesn't recognize us. -The important thing is that she's safe now. -And that we owe to you, Hercules. Although gratitude is not a sentiment easily expressed in simple words. -She'll be well again soon. And all of you will live together in peace. -Are you willing to fight for us, Hercules? -I shall try to speak to the queen. I don't think she's as bad as everyone says, but only an instrument to the power of Menistus. -You, you were the one. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! [CRIES] -Go away, all of you. Let her be alone. -As I came here, I noticed you have many horses. -The plane of [INAUDIBLE] is full of them. -And [INAUDIBLE] is an excellent hunter. Not a day goes by that he doesn't capture some. -Yes, we could really put together a first rate cavalry if we only had cavalrymen. You said you wanted to see the queen, didn't you? Don't expect any compassion from her, Hercules. Cnidia is not only frivolous, she's evil. -Father. -You? Here? -The best secret agent we have spying in the enemy camp. My daughter, Daria. -We already know each other. -Have you brought any news? -None at all, father. I was anxious to learn about [INAUDIBLE]. -About [INAUDIBLE], no one else? I doubt it. -I shall be eternally grateful for all you've done for us, Hercules. -It's dangerous for you to come here. Aren't you afraid? -No. -Not even of the interest that Menistus takes in you? -If I didn't encourage that interest as you call it, how would you expect me to get any information from him? -Your pride is as noble as the cause you fight for. I didn't mean to offend you. -I don't believe you would, Hercules. -Listen, Daria, your father said it's not possible to put together a cavalry without cavalrymen, but we could find more men. -What men? -The slaves who are working on the walls. -For every one who runs away, five others are put to death. -Don't worry. [INAUDIBLE] and I will give freedom back to the people of [INAUDIBLE]. We'll begin with the slaves. -I know a secret passage that leads to their prison. Father! [INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE], come here, all of you! [CROWD CHATTER] -What's the matter? -Listen to me, father. Listen to me, all of you! Hercules is going to lead us! CROWD: Hooray! -And as of tonight, Menistus and his friends have lost their battle before it started! [CROWD CHEERS] [GATE CREAKS OPEN] -The secret passage is over there, Hercules. We'll have to get the sentry out of the way. -Hey, you with that pitchfork! [GRUNTS] -Follow me, Hercules. -Blocked tight. It's a passage used in case of siege, but it would take a team of elephants to move the stone that closes it. -Hmm. -Good. Good work! Come on. Come on. Let's go inside. -Not you. If anything happened to you, what would become of your people? You can't risk your life. -But -No. -Before long the horses will arrive. I'll stand guard here till day break. Go on. -Good. -And good luck, Hercules. -The same to you, [INAUDIBLE]. -Hercules? Hercules? The coast is clear. -We've been waiting for you, Hercules. -You? -Hurry, follow me. This is one of the passages that leads to the prison where they keep the slaves who work on the wall. Hercules, I must go back to the palace now. I don't want my absence to be noticed. -Daria, wait. -It's time for me to go. May the gods protect you. [CROWD CHATTER] -Water. Water. -You filthy worm. I'll give you water! There! Move over! Get out of my way. What rotten duty. Shut up in this trap with sewer rats. -It won't be long till our relief comes on duty. Keep calm. -Makes me sick. -You stay here and keep your eyes [INAUDIBLE]. -Straighten out. -By the gods, [INAUDIBLE], there's a strange atmosphere in this place. It's like something awful might fall on top of you any minute. -What's that? -[INAUDIBLE]. -What can you do, Hercules? You need a sledge hammer. -It's no use, Hercules. All the chains are fastened at the ring in the center. -He'll never manage to pull it out. -He has to pull it out. If not, we're all done for. [GROANS] -He's done it! [CROWD AWES] -He's done it! -Silence! One at a time, up the rope. Go on. [CROWD CHATTER] -Move faster! Run to the horses! Run! -Get going! -Come on, friends! Catch me! [MEN YELL] -[INAUDIBLE]. -An awkward position, huh? Well, give my regards to Menistus. -[INAUDIBLE] too, mosquito? -Now I can really say I fought at your side. -Come on, let's get away from here. Hurry, hurry! --[INAUDIBLE], how did you get here? -Hurry, [INAUDIBLE], hurry! The horses! -You take the boy with you. When Menistus finds out, [INAUDIBLE]. Go on, go on! -[INAUDIBLE], here's your horse. -Archers, aim, shoot! [MEN GROAN] -These [INAUDIBLE] are a favorite weapon of Menistus. -As far I know, dead men have never been able to build walls. If we go on like this, we'll soon be without a labor force. -Menistus knows what he's doing. -The people of [INAUDIBLE] are a pack of [INAUDIBLE] rat pickers. And such beggars are held at bay with threats, as a general rule, when bloody repression isn't necessary. -This violence can lead only to more violence. The great walls of [INAUDIBLE] are going to remain unfinished for a long time to come. You're destroying them instead of constructing them. -Supreme power admits no restrictions. You'll have to decide, Daria. Either you're with me, or you're against me. What do you want? Show them in. Where are you going? -The queen is expecting me. -Ten slaves have been executed in public. They prefer to be killed rather than give information. -Or perhaps they had none, but we know it was Hercules. And the slaves he set free have already increased the number of rebels. -What are we waiting for then? -Very soon. Much sooner than you imagine, we shall attack them. Beyond the plane of [INAUDIBLE] and through the ravine of the [INAUDIBLE], following the course of the sacred river, that's where [INAUDIBLE] is hiding. -Who would have suspected it? -It's like an eagle's nest. -How did you discover this? -The method I used was very simple. Open it. I had a spy among the slaves. -A spy would never have asked be paid in such a manner. -You're right. He asked for gold, but a traitor to one side might betray the other one, too. It all depends on how much he's offered. And now I'll explain to you what our plan is. The rebel forces are concentrated beyond the sacred river. They are hiding in a network of caves. We must block them inside and destroy them once and for all. You have time enough to organize carefully. Now get on with it. -This isn't going to be easy. It'll take the entire garrison. --[INAUDIBLE], are your brothers still living in ravine [INAUDIBLE]? Good. Go tell them to stop anyone who tries to get through to the rebel encampment. If anyone here is turned traitor, we'll find out who it is. Go on. -It was a sight I shall never forget. One man all alone, standing against everyone and everything, to save the life of a girl, a girl he didn't even know. I think that what gives such great strength to Hercules is the justice that guides his actions. -Are you really so smitten with Hercules? -Strange to say, so much that for a moment I felt myself wavering in my convictions. -For a queen like you, it isn't easy. But you could give up what you call your convictions, or couldn't you? -No, I never could. But neither do I want to give up Hercules. -You will have to. He has chosen another destiny. -We'll be back sometime before sunset. -This move makes me very happy. Finally we enjoy the open sky again. Imagine a little cabin on the river bank with running water at the door. -I've always dreamed of one. -Before long our troubles will be over, dear. -And then we'll have a house all our own. -I'd like a house filled with flowers. -Turtle dove, did you hear that? And we want a great big kitchen with a beautiful fire. -Hey, you old, glutton, hey! [INAUDIBLE] support your appetite, that's all you're thinking of. --[INAUDIBLE], perhaps moving [INAUDIBLE] is dangerous. I'm afraid she'll never make it. -Now they've arranged [INAUDIBLE] for her. When they come back, they'll move her with that. She won't suffer at all. You'll see. Let's go inside now. -What's got into them? Why does everybody have to move somewhere else, huh? -The slave who disappeared must've been a spy. -No one in sight. -Look, there. They've abandoned their camp now. -Maybe they're suspicious. -What do you we go and have a look around? -I'll take the sentry on the left. [GROANS] -Good shooting, brother. [CRIES] -Come on. -[INAUDIBLE], how do you feel? -But where, where am I? -You must keep calm and don't be afraid. You're in a safe place where no one would do you any harm. -Why, you're [INAUDIBLE]. The girl who's going to marry Hermes. -You've recognized me! Oh, [INAUDIBLE], you don't know how happy that makes me. If you only knew how worried we've been about you. -And my father? -He's coming back to take you away. Hercules is with him. -Hercules? -Yes. He's fighting for our cause. -The divine son of Zeus. -It was he who saved you from certain death. -[SIGHS] -[INAUDIBLE], what is it? What's wrong with you? [SCREAMS] -[INAUDIBLE]. [MEN LAUGH] -Come here to me, girl. I like you. -Take your hands off her, you filthy beast! [SCREAMS] -[INAUDIBLE], look at this. It's gold! -Come on! -Hurry up! Let's get out of here! -Take cover! Someone's coming! [MEN LAUGH] [WOMAN SCREAMS] -[INAUDIBLE]. -She's a spy. -Take her back to the city. -On your horse, spy. [INAUDIBLE], keep an eye on her. -Don't try to talk. It's almost night and Hermes will be here soon. -Everything is growing dark. Night has already covered my eyes. I can't see anymore. I can't see anymore! Hermes! -[INAUDIBLE]. -We would have been so happy together. Before very long, we would have had a house of our own surrounded with flowers. -[INAUDIBLE]! [INAUDIBLE] -Oh! -[INAUDIBLE]. [CRIES] -Flowers everywhere. I can smell their perfume now. I can smell their perfume. -[INAUDIBLE]. --[INAUDIBLE] wants an open fire where she can listen to the wind roar on the winter evenings. Four snug walls just for her and for me. -A house is the whole world for two people who love each other. -A snug little house and a great big kitchen. [LAUGHTER] Hey, look there. -Cover us from behind, hurry! Hercules, come with me. -[INAUDIBLE]! [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] -No. -There's nothing we can do. [CRIES] -No. No. [CRIES] -They'll pay for this. They'll pay dearly for this. Menistus knows our hiding place. We must attack them immediately. -We're not ready to move yet. [INAUDIBLE], Hermes, and I can go rouse for people. -In the cellars of [INAUDIBLE] tavern, we can meet there with the leaders tonight an organize the rebellion. [INAUDIBLE] needs only a spark to set off a revolt. -You take the cavalry to the walls. I swear at daybreak the east gate will be open. -It shall be as you wish, Hercules. At daybreak we shall attack. And may the gods give us victory. -There is the spy. -Daria whatever possessed you to betray your friends like this? Betray the trust which I had placed in you? -If I'd helped our people I betrayed you. -You know what to expect. -I know what I can imagine. Cnidia, why don't you look around you? Why don't you like closer to your people? You still have time, but these traitors around you-- [SLAPS] -You won't save yourself accusing others. She's are conspirator against her [INAUDIBLE] queen and the security of this state. -Why have you nothing to say your own defense? -Because I have to defense. The rebel leader is my father. [CROWD CHATTER] -Silence! Not only has she spied on us, but she invites Hercules into the cause of the rebels. Go on, you. Confess that you made him fall in love with you. -Is it true? Hercules is love with you? Menistus, torture her. Torture her to death. Do to her whatever you wish. -You tried to make a fool of me. You will die in agonizing torment. -One moment. I have a better idea, Menistus. -Let's hear it then. -Let's put her to the test of truth. The [INAUDIBLE]. Daria, we have solemnly invoked the god of the underworld, that he with his powerful arm may give support to the mighty work that we are undertaking for the safety of this city. In the shadowy confines of the temple, sacred to the goddess of truth, we ask you for the [INAUDIBLE] of your crime of treason. Are you ready to offer the sacrifice of your life itself. -What is your will is also my own. -Even if it should mean the betrayal of the man that you love? -Even if it should mean the betrayal of the man I love. -You will go to the rebel camp and tell Hercules that queen wishes to see him. -Let's go inside. -It's exactly the way we left it before. -They may have set a trap for us. -What if they have? We have no other choice. Come on. -Not a soul in sight. -The coast is clear. -Are you still determined to speak to the queen? -I must try to at least. Go on now, you two. -It won't be necessary for you to go to the camp now. Daria, take him to the queen. You and your men follow his friends. And you go and tell Menistus. -Daria! -Hercules, I was coming to get you. Cnidia wants to see you. -I was on my way to her. -Come then, I'll take you to her. -We can make it now. -[INAUDIBLE], Hermes. -The time has come to act. Run and tell the others. We'd better get out of sight quickly. -Inside. -Wait a minute. It's too quiet in this place. -You've walked into my trap, Hercules. You have no escape. I compliment you on your work, Daria. -Daria! -Capture him! I want him alive! [MEN YELL] -[INAUDIBLE], you come with me! [LAUGHS] -Menistus, what is going on? Why is this woman still here? -She was the bait in the trap. Hercules has fallen into the pit of death. The poisonous fumes and the red caverns will be the end of him. -My lord, the tavern of [INAUDIBLE] has been completely surrounded and Hercules' two friends are inside. -Conspirators. Burn the tavern. Don't let a single one of those rebels get out alive. --[INAUDIBLE], we're ready to move. -It's not time yet. We'll attack at daybreak. CNIDIA: Why? Why has it come to this? DARIA (VOICEOVER): Cnidia, why don't you live closer to your people? You still have time. You still have time. You still have time. -Hercules. -I have to get out. I have to find a way. I must. It's nearly dawn. [MEN CHEER] -At dawn [INAUDIBLE] will attack with all his cavalry. -When he does, the streets of [INAUDIBLE] will run with blood. [MEN CHEER] -Hercules will open the eastern gate to them. That means [INAUDIBLE] on one side and the people on the other. Our enemies will be crushed between two [INAUDIBLE]. [MEN CHEER] -No rebel is to taken prisoner. We must show Menistus ashes and charred bodies, not living men! -[INAUDIBLE]. -Leave the room. I want to be alone. [COUGH] -[INAUDIBLE]. CNIDIA: Hercules? [COUGHS] -[CRIES] Hercules! -You coward! -Hercules, forgive me for everything. [GASPS] Forgive me. -I'll take care of you. Cnidia, I forgive you. [MOANS] -I'm afraid it's too late, Hercules. It's not use trying. It's not use. [MOANS] Daria, Daria is innocent. She was under the influence of a narcotic. I was mistaken. I was mistaken to do it. I only wanted you. -Let me help you. -No. I want you To help my people. I want you to help my people. -Zeus! Pull all your strength in my arms! [MUSIC PLAYING] -We were expecting you, Hercules! -It's morning. [INAUDIBLE] -[INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. [MEN CHEER] -[INAUDIBLE] is attacking! -Come on, friends. We'll die like lions! -Let me be first! -Hermes, no! -Hermes! Why did you do it? Why did you do it? -[INAUDIBLE] [GASPS] -That's not true. You shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have let you do it. Why didn't you wait for the rest of us? --[INAUDIBLE] remember, you have a little house waiting with a, with a great big kitchen. -Oh, Hermes. -And I, and I am going to my little house. And [INAUDIBLE], and [INAUDIBLE] already there. She's there waiting. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Hermes! -To the east gate quickly! -Turn the wheel! Close the gate! Harder, all of you! -It's [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]! -Hercules! Hercules! -Speak up, mercenary, if you value your life. Where's my daughter? Where is Menistus? Speak or you die! -Speak or you'll never speak again. -They were heading for the north gate. They took the way from the palace garden. -I know the way. Come on! -Menistus, we don't want to held back. -Wait for me here. We need that woman as a hostage. -Let's kill her now. She'll only be a burden to us. -We'll leave in the desert for vultures to feed on. -Menistus! DARIA: Hercules! -Stay where you are! Come back here! Filthy cowards. DARIA: Kill him! Kill him! Don't worry about me, Hercules. -Take one step. -Watch out, Menistus. Don't do it. -I have a proposition to make you. -Proposition of a poisonous snake. Let's hear it. -Give me a horse and safe conduct to the frontier of the kingdom or your daughter will die right here. -Release her at once. You have my word. -I don't trust you. Your daughter's coming with me. -You're not moving from here, Menistus. -Hercules, no! -[CRIES] Hercules! -Daria, it's all over now. -Oh, thank the gods. -Hercules? -[INAUDIBLE]. -Now you can't call me mosquito anymore. -No? What else am I to call you, mosquito? -The Council of elders of this city have decided to erect a temple to Zeus, the wisest of the gods and divine father of all mortals. -The time has come. Goodbye, [INAUDIBLE]. And may fortune smile on [INAUDIBLE] and on her people forever. -We'll never forget what you've done for us, Hercules. Hercules, stay with us. -I must go, Daria. My fate lies far away from [INAUDIBLE]. Perhaps I'll come back. Goodbye. Goodbye, friends. -Hercules, may Zeus your father protect you always. -Turtle dove, look at me. -No. You're an old glutton. [LAUGHTER] [CROWD CHEERS] -Long live Hercules, the greatest of mortal men! [CROWD CHEERS] -Hercules! Hercules! Wait for me, Hercules! -[INAUDIBLE]! [INAUDIBLE] -What is it, mosquito? -Take me with you. -Now, mosquito, you stay with [INAUDIBLE] and Daria. They'll treat you like a brother. -I'll polish your weapons. I'll tend to your horses. Please let me stay with you. -No. -Some day you might need someone to help you. Who will protect you? -I almost forgot about that. It's true. You did save my life. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Well? -You run along. You can't leave her all alone. Go on. Go back to her. -Bye, Hercules! Bye! [CROWD CHEERS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
