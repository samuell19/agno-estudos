Are you gonna tell me what the hell is going on? Memphis. Are you gonna tell me what's going on? Babe, is this it? Is it happening? Where are we going? - Look, I gotta make a stop, all right. - Oh, no, wait, Memphis. [dramatic music] [gun firing] [solemn music] Nurse. Nurse. - Glad you could join us. Wasn't sure if you was a late riser or an early birdie. - Looks like you owe me a cup of coffee, partner. - Indeed I do. - Why am I handcuffed? - Miss Morgan, I'm Detective Carter, this is my partner, Detective Darmody. Mind if we ask you a few questions? - Sure. - Sasha, you don't mind if I call you Sasha, do you? Sasha, the reason you're handcuffed to the bedrail here is because we have reason to believe you're working with the cartel, so maybe we can start there. - I don't, I don't do drugs, sir. - Do you deal drugs? - Is this some kind of joke? - I'm afraid not. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm talking about the drugs you and your boyfriend were about to distribute before you were robbed. - And I just told you I don't know what you're talking about. - Let's cut the bull all right. Your boyfriend, Memphis Goff, where is he? - Could someone please explain why I'm handcuffed? - Where is he? Who shot you, Miss Morgan? - Memphis. - Are you saying that Memphis Goff shot you? [dramatic music] - Is he dead? - Is who dead, Miss Morgan, talk to me. - Sasha, all we're trying to get to know is where is Memphis Goff? Where is he? - I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. We were ambushed, and people were coming from everywhere. - Do you hear how you sound? - This sounds like a ride or die kind of thing. - Nah, where I'm from it's called foolish, willing to risk it all for what? For love? - I'm actually jealous. Hell, my wife wouldn't miss a nail appointment for me. Some love. - Yeah, the phantom type. Some women don't figure it out till it's too late. - I'd like to see my lawyer now. - Look, you can talk to your lawyer- - Lawyer now. - In case you change your mind, give us a call, all right? [Sasha groaning] [gentle music] - As you can see, this home comes with so many luxurious contemporary upgrades, like this gourmet kitchen here, the large island. And to your right, a butler's pantry. - I am so in love with this house, especially the kitchen. - Yeah, my wife loves to cook. I'm already imaging the dinner parties here. - Well I'm glad that you both love it. Now I am no cook, but I will tell you that the property value in this area has nearly doubled in the last seven years. Unless you're aging backwards, now would be the perfect time to secure your retirement plan with a solid investment. - Honey, she's right. Now just imagine what this property will yield in like 15 years. - I will let you two discuss it for a minute. I know purchasing your forever home is a- - We want it. I'm ready to make the seller an offer. - Congratulations. I'll start the paperwork right away. [phone buzzing] Oh, I am so sorry. I have to take this, it's urgent. - You're fine, go right ahead. - [Automated Voice] You have a prepaid call from a federal correctional facility from- - [Sasha] Sasha Morgan. - [Automated Voice] To accept this call, dial five, to decline dial nine. - Hey, Jewel. - Oh my God, Sasha. Today is the day, isn't it? I completely forgot you're getting released. - Jewel, please tell me you can pick me up, there's nobody else I can call. - I know, I know, but I am in the middle of a showing right now, but don't worry, I have somebody that owes me a favor, and I'll have them come get you. - Jewel, I don't want a damn stranger picking me up. - Just trust me, okay? I'll see you soon. - Jewel. Jewel. - So now you have to tell me, how did you master the art of cooking? I might need your services for my next upcoming event. - Well tell me more. - All right, let's talk about it on the way out. - I'll be damned girl, even in those rags you still fine as hell. - Malik McKinnley Hathaway. - In the flesh. I'm your chauffeur for the day. ♪ So it's whatever you want - Of all people, Jewel send your crazy ass. - What, you ain't happy to see an old middle school friend? Come here, bring me some love, give me a hug. - See, you still crazy. - Hey, it's good to have you back on this side. - Thank you. - Come on, I got you, come on. - It's good to be back. - Come on, girl, let's go. [phone ringing] - Curry and Company Realtors, this is Titi speaking, how can I help you? - Hey Titi, I'm just wrapping up with my last client, and I am happy to report that we are ready to make two offers. - Two offers? See, that's what I'm talking about Jewel, see, keep your foot on these hoes, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Thanks, Titi. So please go ahead and submit a bid for $2.25 mil for Cortland Road, and- - Okay, wait, hold on, wait. I'm gonna put you on speaker phone. Go ahead. - [Jewel] And 2.7 for the Bellington Ridge. - I am on it right now. - All right. Oh, and make sure you send it directly to Anthony so we can skip the line. - Okay, no worries boss, I got you. And it, this mouse is always trippin', hold on one second. We need a new battery for the mouse. I got you. And it's done. - You are the best. All right, I will see you shortly. - Oh, wait, wait, wait, I'm sorry, Dr. Thomas did call me, and he did tell me that he couldn't make the fundraiser, but he'd donate some money towards the cause. And baby, when I tell you he made a hell of a donation towards the cause. If we keep this up, we're gonna be able to buy more than just the hood, period. - Okay, great, thank you so much, I'll see you in a minute. - You good over there? - Yeah. Just dreaming with my eyes open. - Well you're free at last. - But am I free? - You're gonna be all right though. And your girl got the real estate game on lock, so you got nothing to worry about, we got you. Hey, look who I found. - Oh, there she is. Oh my gosh. It is so good seeing you on this side. - Yeah. - I hated seeing you in there like that. - Tell me about it. - So where do they have you staying? - At some halfway house for the next six moths. - Please tell me you're joking. - I really wish I was. - Listen, ladies, I'm out. Ima let y'all play catch up without me, and we'll catch up later, we'll talk about that little business. - All right, thanks again Malik. - Mm-hmm. - Thanks. - You stay out of trouble. - That's actually on my to-do list. So you are doing pretty good for yousself. - I'm doing okay. Okay, I am killing with a big ax. [Sasha laughing] I mean I've come a long way. I mean who would have thought this black girl from the hood with no college education would turn out to be- - A self-made millionaire. You've always had it in you, Jewel. Ever since we were younger, you've always had the entrepreneurial spirit. I'm proud of you, friend. - Well I couldn't have done it without you. You really motivated me. - Well I mean I did a hell of a motivating, geesh. [Jewel laughing] - Yeah, well, hey, it is your first day home, and I know you're dying for a home cooked meal. - Oh my gosh, yes, that vegan spot that Malik took me to didn't do anything but tickle my taste buds. - I won't be doing the cooking, but I got you covered. But first let's take you shopping. - Oh no, Jewel, I can't, I can't, I can't let you do that. - I insist. Okay, I just have to sign some paperwork with Titi, and then we'll be on our way. - Okay. Wow. - No signing out before six a.m., and you must be in by curfew, which is nine p.m., unless it's approved in advance for work relations. A minute after nine you're late, we lock the doors, you follow me? - Yes, ma'am, I understand. - All right, come on. This is your room. Keep it clean and tidy. I know you received the packets, but I wanna be iterate. Residents must conduct themselves properly at all times. This means no loud, profane or inappropriate language, no stealing or destroying someone's property, and absolutely no fighting or violence towards house members. - [Sasha] Yes ma'am. - [Miss Dixon] Your bed is right there on the end. - I mean everything's good, but you know what's funny? - What? - No matter how much success I have, I still sometimes feel like I don't quite belong, and I'm still trying to earn a seat at their table. - Do you hear yourself right now, Jewel? Forget their table, because from what I've seen you've earned your seat. And I caught that interview with you and Tashara the other night. Jewel, you have a street and a recreational center named after you. Do you understand how many black women and young girls you are inspiring right now? I mean, I would love to trade places with you. So what's up with all this table talk? Jewel, you are a boss. - Thank you. I don't know, I guess, I guess I'm just having a moment. - Well never second guess any of this, seeing your hustle and the audacity for you to win lets everyone know that you've made for this. Trust me they see. - Well, speaking of strong black women, I can only imagine what you've been through the past few years. - It was rough. I didn't know if I was gonna make it out alive. - I just, I still can't believe you just got swept up and in all of that. And then when you, when you called me to come get the stuff from your house, I knew it was bad. - It's too late to cry about it now. - So I heard they, they found him dead. - Yeah, the chaplain called, sent word from his mom, told her that they found him. - I'm so sorry. Sasha, I know you loved him. - Still in love him. And that's never gonna change. - I know you're still mourning, but I need you to remember that you are smart and beautiful, and you have an amazing future ahead of you. And speaking of future, I just promoted Titi, so she'll be out in the field a little bit more, so I could use another pair of hands around the office. - So you expect me to come to your office and take out your trash, and run your errands and get you coffee? No ma'am, that is not gonna happen, I'll pass. - [Jewel] Really? - Yes. - Really? My feelings are hurt. Okay. - All right, I apologize. But, seriously, my parole officer has been on my back about securing a job by the end of the month. - And real estate is a job. - I don't know, Jewel, that's more your thing. - Girl, please, money is my thing. - Facts. - Okay, so you're the one that turned me on to it in the first place. So I mean, here look, the market is up, now is the time. Whereas most people focus on the male buyer, I don't, it's the women that you have to connect with. We have the power. - Chess, not checkers, right? - Sleep on it. Oh, I have got to take this. To be continued.

'Cause what I gather here you never even worked in a restaurant before. - Well, the plan was to get into real estate. I helped my cousin purchase a building for his own chicken spot. True I never worked there, but I'm a fast learner, and I like to think I have great customer service skills. - Well, I mean with those great customer service skills, I mean, why not just work there? - Yeah, he passed over a year ago, and his children decided not to continue the business. - I'm sorry to hear that. I see. Well, I mean we get, we get pretty busy over here, especially on the weekends, and I like to keep my customers happy, especially with the competition coming over there across the street.

Yo, be real, did you take Jackie's shit? - Look, I came out here to calm my nerves, and get the hell away from that place, not to be interrogated by whatever the hell your name is. And I'm gonna tell you just like I told Jackie, ain't nobody took that old cheap ass MP3 player. Damn. - I believe you. Can I see? My name is Sasha, and I've never been able to figure these things out. So what's your story? - Oh, you one them, huh? - One of who? - The type that can mind your own damn business. - Yo, why are you so angry? - Why are you so nosy? - I know exactly what you're going through. - Nobody know what the fuck I'm going through but me. - Okay, okay, maybe you right, so tell me. - You must think I'm here to make friends. - No, but it doesn't hurt to vent to someone. - Okay, Iyanla.

Conspiracy. - And how long you got? - 60 Months, seven years supervised release. - And how long he got? - He don't, he's deceased. - Damn. - So what you do? - Check and credit card fraud. And when I tell you I learned my lesson, 'cause none of it was worth it. - [Gina] Count time. - Thank Gina. So you good? - Yeah, I'm straight, Sasha. - And let know if there's anything else I can get for you, okay? - Hey, Mr. J., you doing all right, or do you want a refill? - Yes. - All right, I got you baby. Welcome to Bobby's Diner, I'll be right with you. - What a pleasant surprise. - How did you know I worked here? - I didn't, just a coincidence. So, this is your new career choice? - It's an honest living. - Honestly broke. - Look, did you come here to patronize me, or you gonna order something? - Sorry, I didn't mean no harm, I was just being observant. - [Sasha] Right. - Come on, Sash, we both know ain't making no money here. And once the double RC get their 25% You lucky if you still got up a bucket to piss in, and a window to throw it out of. - Water or coffee? - Coffee. - All right, you want sugar. - All black. - So you know I don't think it's a coincidence that you came here, right? - I mean why not? I had some business on this side of town, and I just wanted to burn some time before my next stop. - Um, let me pull the MLS listing, and check the specs, and then I'll have Titi give you a call, and we'll get together a walk through. Will that work? Okay, perfect, Mr. Maddox. Okay, please tell Cheryl I said thank you for the bottle of wine. Okay, all right, bye. - You sent Malik to spy on me. - Spy on you? Girl, what are you talking about? - He came by my job yesterday, Jewel. - And what exactly does that have to do with me? - You're the only person who knows where I work. - What is your point? I have not discussed you with Malik. Besides, I'm still feeling some kind of way about being outbid by that stuffy old diner anyway. - Whatever. I'll have you know I like the stuffy old diner. It's helping me align my chakras. - Oh, well if you get some of that real vitamin D, he'll align your spine and all your chakras. - No, no way, you're nasty. - It's facts. But anyway, let's get out of here, and go get something to eat. How does honey baked salmon with some whipped garlic mashed potatoes sound? And then after that we can get some mani pedis? - You know what, I could use a manicure right now. - Okay. Hey, Genie, it's Jewel, can you squeeze me and my girl in for some manicures? Okay, perfect. We'll see you in a couple of hours. Let's get out of here. - Let's go. You're buying. - I am. Girl, I don't understand how you find it so hard to believe, I think he's had a crush on you since the eighth grade, but ever since Memphis come in the picture it's been a wrap. - Malik just isn't my type. [Jewel laughing] - Since when have you had a type? - Look, I'm just not ready to be seen with anyone. I have a lot going on right now, and the last thing I need to do is jump in a relationship. - No, no, I know what it is, you refuse to move on. - Girl, Memphis is dead. Okay, he's not coming back, and I don't mean to be insensitive, but you gotta move on with your life. And Malik is a great guy. - Okay, then why aren't you with Malik? - Because Malik is like my brother. I mean what is this all about? Is this, is this to prove that you don't need a man to take care of you anymore? I mean, Sasha, you've got so much bottled up inside of you, and it's not healthy because it's gonna bubble up. - Can we not do this? Please? - I'm sorry. Can you just promise me you'll come to me when things get too heavy? You love me, girl.

You gonna order something or what? - What's good? - Hold on. I think our omelets is one of my favorite dish. - Then that's what I'm having, exactly how you make yours. - One omelet coming right up. - And how's that working out for you? - You know I didn't think out him like that at first. He's nice, he's successful. I think about Memphis a lot. I mean I know he's gone, but what we had, there's no replacing that. I, sorry, I just miss him. - Let it out. - I just love him so much. - Let me ask you this, do you think that Memphis' death is keeping you from moving on with your life? - Honestly, I don't know. - Sasha, it's okay for you to find love again. Grieving is a part of letting go. I want you to give yourself permission to grieve as long as you need to, okay? - Okay. All right, so did you enjoy everything? - [Customer] Yes, ma'am, thank you very much. - No problem. Thank you. Well, well, well, I guess you really enjoy the omelets and coffee here, huh? - Not nearly as much as I enjoy you. Listen, Sasha, I ain't asking for much, just one date, that's it. Please don't make me get down on my knees. - No, no, no. No, no, you will not embarrass me here. Fine, I'll go out on a date with you. - That's the spirit. You won't regret it. [gentle music] [indistinct chatter] Here it is. - You really are full of surprises. I was not expecting this at all. - Oh yeah? - This is fancy. - I wanted to do something special for our first date, so I decided I would go the extra mile. Okay. - Not too much, I'm a lightweight. - Right, I shouldn't try to get you drunk on the first date, right? - Oh stop. [laughing] - All right, here we are. So, to our beautiful friendship, and to the future. The date was so bad that I gave the waiter $20 just to spill my wine on me. - [laughing] No, you did not. - Yes, I did. I had to get the hell up out of there once she started reading off the damn checklist that was like this long. - Well I admire her directness. - Sasha, why don't you come and join me on my team down at the firm? - Well, I mean what exactly is it that you do? Because last I know of you were a chauffeur and a spy. - Ouch. - [Sasha] No, but seriously, what do you do? - I'm a real estate broker. - Ah, okay. Well that makes sense. You and Jewel work together right, something like business partners, right? - Something like that. My firm sponsored her when she first started out. - Okay. - And I'm willing to do the same for you. - What, sponsor me? - No, no, no. What I'm offering is a paid internship, Sasha. I'll pair you with one of my agents, and have her groom you as my executive assistant. And I'm willing to throw in a $10,000 sign on bonus. That's gotta be more than what you're making down at the diner, right? - Okay, you know what, I can tell that you and Jewel are definitely friends, because you're starting to sound like her. - You out here with a winning team, you say the word and I got you. - You got me, huh? - Oh yeah. I got you. - Okay, so what do you think? - Jewel, I love it, but why are you giving me this place? - I'm not giving it to you, I'm letting you stay here at reduced rate. It belongs to a friend of mine, and they just wanted me to keep it up. And I figured since you're getting out of the halfway house here pretty soon you would need a place to stay. - Are you sure you can afford this? - We're actually doing him a favor, you know, helping him keep it clean, keep the lights on. So what's going on with you and Malik? Are you guys coupling or still in a situationship, entanglement? - We are taking things extremely slow. - Slow as in you haven't given up the cake yet, or slow as in I have time to lose 10 pounds for my maid of honor dress? - [laughing] Both. He's been pressing me about quitting the diner, and coming to work for him. - Girl, he's trying to lace your pockets, let him. - He's trying to do more than lace my pockets, Jewel. - Again, let him. - I cannot believe you're suggesting that I give him my goods. - I mean who else you gonna give them to? - Really? [Sasha and Jewel laughing] - This is for you. And this. - What is this? - Keys to the Benz outside. - Oh no, Jewel, I can't. - Sasha, you need a vehicle, plus I couldn't pass up a deal like that. - I don't know what I would do without you. - Well that's what friends are for. Oh, are you gonna come to my fundraiser next Saturday, right? - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Perfect.

[Inaudible] Over 20. - My guy, how you doing? Good to see you. [music playing] - Congratulations, Jewel, couldn't be more proud of you. - Thank you, your generous patronage and support certainly help make it all possible. - Well you know me, I like to look out for my people. And if the cards fall in my favor, then those classes down at the center will make a great lineup for recruitment. Speaking of cashing in on some of these investments, how did Sasha like my gift? - She loved them. But what I don't understand is why you didn't give her these so called gifts yourself. I hate lying to her. - Jewel, you know how stubborn Sasha is, and she's on this damn ego trip where she doesn't want the help of a man. - Well then you two, you need to figure it out, 'cause I am not trying to get all caught up in y'all's lovebird drama. - No sweat. She'll come around in due time, trust me. Um. - Hey, Mr Hathaway. Jewel, channel eight news is over there, we gotta freshen your makeup up. - Are you serious? I didn't think they were gonna make it. - They're here, right on time. - Is it that bad? - Just a little on the nose. - Hi, how are you? Thanks so much for coming, I didn't think you were gonna make it. [indistinct] Thank you, Titi, you wanna come? [fundraiser guests indistinctly talking] - Sasha, I'm so glad you made it. - You outdid yourself tonight, and you look fabulous. - Oh, thank you, you look mighty saucy yourself too. You look so good. - Thank you. - Pardon me. Jewel, we need you. - Oh, okay, enjoy yourself honey, I will be right back. What do we got going on? - Wow, you're looking very amazing tonight. - Thank you. You don't look so bad yourself. - I say we leave here and go to my place- - [Jewel] Excuse me, excuse me, can I get everybody's attention? - For coffee. - Mm-hmm. - All black. - Coffee, huh? - It is so good to see you all here tonight in support of the buy back our community movement. Like so many of you I share a passion for staying connected to my root, and over the past few years I've watched the neighborhood I proudly call home fall victim to gentrification, and I knew that I needed to do something, and I did. And I am happy to report that with your generous donations the Jewel Curry Foundation has secured five multi-unit apartment buildings and three shopping centers. [guests applauding] And last but not least we now have philanthropic partnerships that will allow us to provide workshops in financial literacy, entrepreneurship and home ownership at no cost. [guests applauding] Again, I would like to thank you all so very much for your support and your blessings. My team and I, we will not let you down. - Oh that's me. Speaking of team. [laughing] Y'all give it up for my boss. [guests cheering] No, give it up for my boss. [guests cheering] Without further ado, give it up for Dorrough.

Hey, did a lady by the name of Sasha Morgan stop in your office just now? - Oh, God, please don't tell me she is under investigation. - No. - I just approved her for early release from the halfway house. - No, no, nah, she's good, she's good. - Then why you barking up her skirt then? - No reason, no reason at all. - Whatever, I don't believe you. - So, do you have any questions thus far? - No, I think you answered everything. Oh, wait, you mentioned that Malik is the only person who has the passwords to all of the logins- - Hey, hey, how's my girl doing? - Great, I think she'll work out just fine Mr. Hathaway. - Good, that's what I wanna hear. Could you excuse us for a second? - Yes, sir. If you need anything I'll be up front. - Okay, thank you. I already told you if we're gonna be working in this enviornment together we are keeping things strictly business. - All right, all right, I'll play fair, but you can't blame me for trying. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. - Okay. [Sasha laughing] [gentle music] - We're good, you can trust me this time. He's not willing to negotiate so we're just gonna have to go with his price. - This is the last time, Malik. Okay, I'm already having second thoughts. I don't know this guy, and I'm not trying to get caught up. - Listen, Jewel, as long as we keep things the same, there's nothing to worry about. - That's what you said last time. - Trust me, I got it. - I've worked too hard, I've worked too hard. - We've had some hiccups, I've learned from my mistakes. One last time. Please. - Can you leave? - I love you too. ♪ Three shots in ♪ And I'm thinking about you - I just wanna say congratulations, you lasted a week with us. - Are you surprised? - Not at all. I do believe that sometime in the future we can talk about a partnership. - One step at a time, baby. - Hey, baby, let me get this, give me a second. Yo. - Sasha. - James. - It's been a long time. - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. It's been a minute. - Yeah I heard about what happened to Memphis, I'm sorry, he was a good dude. - Yeah, yeah, he was. - Hey, baby, who's your little friend? - Malik, this is James. James is an old friend of Memphis. - What's good man? All right, it was good seeing you. - Good seeing you too. - [James] Take it easy. - Wow. - Let's go. - But I haven't even gotten our food yet. - I said let's go. I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to lose my cool like that, it won't happen again. You know I love you, right? I'm sorry. [gentle music] Can we talk? - I'm busy. - Once again, I'm sorry about the other night, I didn't mean it. Come on, Sasha, don't ignore me. Look, lately we've been having a great time together, I really wanna continue to be with you. - Can we have this conversation later? - [Malik] I bought you something. - I'll see it when I get off. - Sasha, look, don't let one little mishap mess up what we had. Look, I told you I was sorry, okay, and I told you it won't happen again. - Are you done? - Okay. - Hello? Hello? - Hey baby, it's me. - Malik, what are you doing here? And how did you get in? - Technically this is my spot. - It's your spot? - It's my condo, I own it, I got the keys. - You what? - Listen, Sash, I didn't tell you because I knew you wouldn't accept it if I offered it to you. - So you lied to me, and you tricked me into moving in. - No, that's not it. - Yeah, you and Jewel played me. - Don't bring Jewel into it. - Okay, you know what- - Don't do that. - Malik, just get out. Get the hell out. - Get out? - Yes, get the hell out, leave. - See there you go again, taking my kindness for granted. I ain't going nowhere, this is my shit. - Fine, I'll leave. - And go where? - I'll find a place. - I gave you a new life, a condo, a better playing job, a Benz. - A Benz? - Yeah, that too. You an ungrateful ass bitch. - Who you calling a bitch? And what you gonna do, you gonna hit me? 'Cause you all up in my face. Right. - Get your shit, and get the fuck out. Wait, wait, wait, wait babe, wait. Wait, wait, come here. I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. Sash, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told you I got you something. Look. What's wrong, you don't like it? - It's lovely. - Push the meeting with Mr. Jacobs back to next week, early part of next week. - Why didn't you tell me Malik owned the house? - Titi, could you excuse us for a minute? - Are you sure? - Yes, she's sure. - Yes, please, thank you. Sasha, what is the problem? Aren't you two dating? - That's besides the point, you should have told me. - I don't think it was gonna be a big deal. - Look, I don't like surprises, and I damn sure don't like secrets, especially with someone who has a key to my place who I didn't know had a key showing up in the middle of the night. - I'm sorry, I was just trying to be a friend. - To me or to Malik? - Titi, get Malik.

Undermining commissions only hurt the industry. - [Jewel And Sasha] And the profession. [Jewel laughing] - It's the least I can do. So come by the office on Monday morning, and I'll have Titi cut you a check. [Sasha and Jewel laughing] You are so welcome. You're gonna do great. - Okay. - I gotta get out of here, girl. - All right, bye. [gentle music] Right. I can't wait till I'm done decorating. Yeah. [laughing] [gasping] Let me call you right back. Malik, what the hell? - Lower your voice when you're talking to me. Where you been? I've been sitting here nearly two hours waiting on you. - I was out taking care, I don't have to explain my whereabouts to you. - Do you take me as a joke or something? - Okay, you know what, this is not gonna work, you are an asshole. - [Malik] Oh, I'm an asshole? - Yes, you're an asshole. - I'll show you an asshole. - Get off me. - I'll show you an asshole. - Get off me, put me down. - I'll show you an asshole. - Stop, stop it Malik. - Get your ass in there. - Get off me. Malik. Malik. Open the door. Malik. Malik. - Sasha, what you're describing to me is not something that you should take lightly. This boyfriend, Malik, he sounds like he's suffering from narcissistic personality disorder. - What exactly is that? - A mental health condition. Now it's one that you can diagnose easily, but you definitely spelled out some of the classic traits that point to the disorder. And the emotional abuse that you sustained, that is his way of controlling you to keep you helpless. Bottom line, Sasha, he is obsessed with the idea of being with you because you were involved with a man that he's envied his entire life. You are the winning prize. And these mind games, that's his way of keeping you exactly where he needs you to be, needing him. I'm telling you, if you don't leave now there ain't no telling what he might do next. - Isn't this considered harassment? - Nah, I'm just here for a cup of coffee. - I'm not breaking any laws. - [laughing] Seriously, I'm just here for a cup of coffee. Can a brother get a cup of coffee? - Let me guess, you want that black, right? - Actually cream and sugar. What you working on back there? I see you was busy. - Business plans. - Business plans? Really? How much do I owe you for this? - It's on me. I don't need you lingering around here, interrogating me. - I tell you what, that right there is my personal business card, when you get some time use it. - Detective. - You can call me Brian. - Brian, why you being so nice to me? In your eyes once a criminal always a criminal, right? - Sasha, I mean, everybody deserves a second chance, right? And when I look in your eyes I see this beautiful black queen who I would love to get to know better, I mean that's if nobody beat me to it.

You're still working this fucking job after I told you to quit? And who was that? You talking to cops now? - Malik, don't do this. - Don't do what? See that you a conniving ass bitch? See that you've been lying to me the whole time? Huh, I gave you a job, and you still fucking working here? - Malik, you need to leave. - Or what? - Everything good little sister? I'm gonna tell you one time, bro, go on, get up out of here. - I hear you. I hear you loud and clear. I don't need no trouble. I'll see you around, Sasha. - If he come back, let me know. - He good. ♪ What we do ♪ Don't nobody get to question ♪ What we do ♪ Ain't nobody touch what we do ♪ ♪ Touch them how we do ♪ Don't nobody get to question what we do ♪ ♪ Nobody can tell us what to do ♪ - So you already know, once I get things up and running, you know you got a job. - And you gotta be a cool boss.

Why you ignoring me, Sasha? - Just leave. - Can we talk? - No. You need to leave like she asked you to do. - That's between me and her kiddo. - Nuh-uh, you know what? - Nuh-uh. - You understand a child's place. - All right, sis, ima be outside if you need me. - Look, Sash, I'm sorry about everything. Lately I've just been, mentally just gone mentally, and I've been having a lot on my mind. But I love you. And I wanna be there for you. - Who told you about this place? - Who else? - Malik, we broke up, it's over between us. Just leave, I'm doing my own thing now. - Who you think you talking to with your ungrateful ass? Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Do you know what I can do to you? [Sasha laughing] - After everything I've been through, you of all people don't put any fear in my heart. - Sasha, is he a problem? Just say the word. - You got yourself a little security guard. - Just leave, and don't come back. - Congrats on your little spot. You'll need me again. - And good riddance with yo creepy ass. - Whatever trick. - He a fucking creep. Girl, that's a dusty ass. - [indistinct] [gentle music] - Thank you so much. Bye. Well looky here. - Oh, look at this. Curtesy of my bestie. Oh, great minds think alike. [laughing] - Wow, it's really coming together. - It is, isn't it? I love it. - I knew it wasn't gonna be a mistake investing in this place with you. - Investing? - Yeah, I thought about it, and don't worry about paying me back that money, I think we need to be in business together. I'm okay with 25%. - Okay, so let me understand this, so I do all the hard work, and you just come swoop in and collect the benefits? - Sasha, I mean let's be real, you wouldn't have all this stuff if it wasn't for that additional money I gave you. It's strictly business. - I just asked for a simple favor from you, not your involvement. And I damn sure didn't intend to enter into a partnership. - Okay, so you have a problem doing business with me after everything we've been through? - I hate misconception. - You think I misled you? - Why did you tell Malik about my new office? - He asked what you were up to, and I told him, nothing more, nothing less. I mean what is the issue? I mean we all grew up together. It's not like he's a stranger. - Are you in business with him? Because if you're doing business with Malik then I don't wanna be involved with you. - Malik is a great businessman, he helped build my business to where it is today, and I don't shit on my friends, Sasha, you know that. - Okay, so then you owe him. - What is your problem with Malik? Hell, what is your problem in general. - Malik is a jerk, Jewel. He's manipulative and he's trouble, and if you don't seen that then your naive. - Naive? Wow. It's easy for you to judge someone else's come up when you've been taken care of ever since you were 19. - If you're referring to Memphis, he did not take care of me. - Girl, bye. Memphis had you all strutting around the hood spoiled. But I'll admit you slept with the right one to get on top, didn't have to work hard for anything. But me, I busted my ass to get to where I am today. I earned every dime of my success, and I don't feel guilty about it. I didn't have to bed a baller to get mine. - Jewel, it sounds like you been jealous of me for a very long time. So it must feel real good for you to finally see me down on my luck asking for a simple favor just so you can throw this shit back in my face. You know what, you and Malik both can go straight to hell. - You know, I didn't come here for this. I thought I was helping out my best friend, but I see that you're impossible. Have a nice life. - Goodbye. Yeah so have you been before? I heard it's beautiful there. - I've never been there, but I could imagine lying on that beach and looking at the stars. - And the weather is amazing. [indistinct] - [Waitress] Here are your drinks. - Thank you. - Appreciate it. - [Waitress] You're welcome. - Do you have any salads or anything. - Make that two. - [Waitress] Of course, enjoy. - Gotta admit, I almost thought you wasn't gonna call me. - Well, I didn't know if I would. - So what made you change your mind? - I don't know, maybe I'm not the phantom type. - Not the phantom type. - Uh-huh. [Sasha laughing] - Okay, all right. Well, to new beginnings. - To new beginnings and something new. - And something new, you ain't gonna forget about that. That's good, that's good. [dramatic music] - Gentleman, can I help you? - Jewel Curry, we have a warrant for your arrest. - What? No, there's gotta be a mistake here. Can you, can you just, can I grab my cell phone? Titi. Titi call my lawyer, let them know what's happening. - Sounds like we need to renegotiate our agreement. It's $100,000 over budget. - I'll have my team take a look at it and fix the numbers where it's beneficial to you, how about that? - Mr. Bennet, my real estate company invests profoundly in local communities, and we've closed more deals than 90% of our competitors. - Impressive. - That's why she's the best and I brung her to you. - It's the only reason why I'm doing business with you is because of her. - Well, we'll negotiate a great price, and we'll keep you in the loop as the transaction progresses. - And we're talking? - It's on the market for $2.6 million. - Ah, but it's in Dallas. Not a fan of the Cowboys. [laughing] - Now that was interesting. - Malik, don't get me caught up in your bullshit. - Got us some chips for a snack. - Is that barbecue? - No, it's plain. - Girl, give me one.
