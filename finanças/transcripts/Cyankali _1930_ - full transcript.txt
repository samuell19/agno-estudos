Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! "So you don't know who performed the operation on Hedwig Fent?" "It is said that a crime against burgeoning life has been committed in your flat. I have to question your daughter." Well then, Miss Fent. You had relations with a certain Paul Krüger, hadn't you? Yes? So you don't want to answer. Frau Fent, according to the doctor's examination the last surgery was done three days ago. Who performed it? No answer here, either. Well, then. Officer! Inspector? Officer, bring in the remand prisoners! - Yes, Inspector. Paul, Paul! - Hete. Krüger! Tell me, where did you get the instrument? Not from you. Now listen. Let's suppose you're in the right. Why don't you budge, then? Where are the millions, where's the people? They are still asleep. Perhaps 100.000 women more must die from fever. And how do you want to change that? Birth control! The state must help the millions of jobless, homeless, breadless people, not the abortionist! That is the spirit which each year, in Germany alone, brings 800.000 mothers into conflict with the law. A law that turns 800.000 mothers into criminals every year... ...isn't a law! Don't deliver a speech. Officer, lead them off. Paul... Paul! Keep calm, Hete. I'm coming back. Frau Fent, listen to me now. You're a respectable woman, aren't you? We must find the person who committed such a severe crime, no? Just look at your child. Who ravaged your daughter so terribly? A criminal? A crime? If a child comes to the mother in mortal fear? What's that supposed to mean? Do you want to insinuate that Frau Fent herself committed the crime? Yes, indeed. She did it. And every mother would have done it. Well. Frau Fent! No... no... Mother, don't! No! Stay here, mother! No! Let the woman stay here for a few hours more. Perhaps they are the girl's last. Well then, Frau Fent, you can stay here for the time being. But in any case, I must ask you to be at our disposal. 10.000... 10.000 must die. Will no one help us?
