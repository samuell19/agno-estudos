Adaptarea: Legendofmir Traducerea: DOOMNEZEU My grandfather told me when I was a kid he could listen to the coyotes howling at night. He could see the herd of buffaloes pass by. He was taught that the gods were the thunder, the sun and the rain. That the land was for everyone. But when the white men arrived, this became a disaster. My mother was a Chiricaguan Indian and that's where my nickname came from. Chiricahua. My dad was a missionary who came to Santa Fe in New Mexico supposedly to turn the Indians into Christians. And to make the matters worse, my father had the bad idea of knocking up the Chief's daughter, my mom. My grandpa did not take long turn him into a martyr. - No! No! No, don't kill me, I beg you! No! No, don't kill me! - Being half Indian and half Mexican has its advantages. With the Apaches, I'm okay. I get them some things, like guns, and they respect us, to me and the Mexican family with whom I work as a cowboy. But the Indians are more violent than ever. Wagons full of pale faces keep arriving from far east. Now, I just heard that we are not Mexicans anymore. That the Yankees already own half of Mexico. Now the situation is getting rough. - Calm down. It would've been easier if you had sold. If you had moved. Hang him up. Rope him up! - Jacinto, check how many cows went down to the water. - Yeah, pa. - Chiricahua. - Morning, Don Joaquin. - How many did you get? - Not too much. Most of the cowboys are heading west, boss. They say here's a lot of gold over there. - If we can not get anymore cowboys, we're gonna have to go and do it ourselves. But that cattle has to be in Kansas this month. - It's dangerous, Don Joaquin. There's a lot of cow snatchers over there. And the Indians are very upset. - That's why we're taking you with us, Chiricahua. - Okay, Don Joaquin. With the Apaches on this side of Texas, we have no problems. They are friends. But the Comanches beyond the north, they're very cruel. Even hate their mothers. - Hey, Papa, I need to go to town. Who can take me right now? - You, Chiricahua, you can take her. - Of course, Don Joaquin. Anything you say. - Hey, wait, I'm going with you. - Jacinto, we're not done here yet. - Come on, Dad, I need to buy some things. - All right. - You're such a pain in the ass. - Don't worry, Don Joaquin, we'll be back very soon. - All right, take care. - Be right back, I'm going with Don Pancho. - I'm going for some things. - Okay, I'll wait for you here. - Good morning, Don Pancho, how are you? - Juanita, how you been? You look very nice today. What do you need? - This is the list, I hope you can read my writing. - Oh, it'll be ready in a minute, yeah. That's fine. This county of San Marcos has always been a very quiet place. I remember when my grandpa told me that the wind not always blow in the same direction and now I get it. You can start to feel an air of tragedy. - Come on. - Hi, my name is Jacinto. - Hi, my name is Ellie. - Are you a newcomer? - Yes. - I had not seen you before. - My family and I recently arrived here. - Where do you come from? - From New York. - Wow! That's not very similar to this. - I don't know. - Hey, would you like to have a soda with me? - I'm sorry but my brothers are waiting for me. - But, I... - It's Don Laureano. - Son of bitch. They killed Don Laureano. This will be like a kick in the balls to Don Joaquin. He was his compadre and his best friend. - Here you go, Juanita. - Thank you, Don Pancho. Please put it on my tab. - I will, of course. - This little pretty Mexican girl, she's not bad at all. - What's your name, precious? Where you from? Hey, I'm talking to you! - Will you please take your hands off of me? - Hey, it's okay. We just want to know you, pretty. - They say Mexican girls kiss pretty well. - Let's see. - Hey, you leave her alone. - You keep out of this, old man, or we'll burn your fucking store down. - No! - We don't want any problems. Just leave her. Get out of here. - This fucker has big balls. - He surely is the boyfriend of this mamacita. It's your boyfriend, mamacita? What you need is a real man. - No! Chiricahu, no, don't do it! - Mamacita saved you. - Jacinto, where the fuck is Jacinto? - What happened? - We'll explain later, move it! - Yah! Yah! - Fuck! - It's so painful what happened with Laureano. - They say he was killed for assaulting them. - Nobody knows that yet. - Let's see, if they had wanted to assault him, they would've shot him right then and there. Why did they hang him? - For Christ sake, this is not an appropriate topic for the dinner table. - I have heard that Texans want to get all Mexicans out of the state. Maybe it could've been that. - Can they do that, Dad? - Of course not, son, but we must be very careful. All kinds of people are coming to this state. - By the way, what happened yesterday in the store of Don Pancho? - What happened? - Nothing, Papa. Just two gringos that were getting aggressive but Chiricahua knew how to control them. Nothing happened. - Who we should help is Marta and her daughters. Martha. Martha, you're gonna need help at the farm. I can recommend a good foreman. - I really don't know what's going to happen. Without Laureano, things are going to be very difficult. There is already someone who has made us an offer for the ranch. - What do you mean an offer? When? - Some days ago. They talked to Laureano. - How strange. He didn't tell me anything. - He did not want to talk about it. You know, when I tried to talk about it even he got upset. - Good morning, Ramon. We're dismayed because of the death of my compadre, Laureano. - Man, I know. It was a terrible thing. - Do you know something? Who could have done it and why? - Nothing, Don Joaquin. Maybe it was a robbery. - Laureano was very appreciated all over the county. Everyone loved him and if they killed him, it wasn't for stealing, at least by no on from here. - I agree with you, Don Joaquin, and by the way they did it, I'm sure there were many of them, not just one. - May I? I have something to say. The day they brought Don Laureano's body back, I saw something, something strange. His boots and his clothes were muddy. There has been no rain these days. What was Don Laureano doing in the mud? I think someone was chasing, chasing him in the mud. Something else I noticed. He had a stain on his brand new white shirt but it was different from the others. It was like a coffee stain but it wasn't coffee. It was tobacco. Don Laureano didn't use chewing tobacco. - Hey, Ellie, how are you? - Jacinto, right? - You remember me. Do you live nearby? - Yes, behind those hills. And you? - Over there, on that side. Can I ride with you? - Of course. - Even though you're from New York, you don't ride that badly. - And you, despite being Mexican, you're very civilized. - Excuse me? What do you mean, "civilized?" How do you see us in New York? - I'm sorry, that was very rude. But there, the idea of Mexican is a rustler, a bandit, a robber. I'm sorry, I am. - I didn't want to tell you but the reason I approached you was just for that, to get you! - Oh yeah? But you must catch me first. - Yah, go, yah! Be calm, Ellie. - No, you be calm. Those are my brothers. - Where were you, Ellie? Father was looking for you. - Just went out for a ride, brother. - Who is he? - Just a... Just a friend. - A friend? Fuck! - Bill, what are you doing?! - He was with the Indian that day they attacked us! - Jacinto. Jacinto! Don Joaquin! Don Joaquin! - Jacinto! Jacinto! - Whoa. Whoa. Easy. - Jacinto. Help me get him in the house, come on. - The bullet just passed through his shoulder. He's going to be all right, don't worry. - Who could have done this to him? - I don't know but they're going to pay for it. - What's happening here? This was a quiet place. - Father, could you please tell your crazy son over here not to shoot people for no reason?! - My sister, we are in the wild, wild west and that little friend of yours I shot, together with a damned Indian and a Mexican bitch, tried to kill us. Right, brother? - That's right, Dad. We didn't do nothing'. - Just like her mother. And you two, pair of leaches. Your sister was right. I won't allow anymore bullshit like this right here! We have big business to realize and I won't permit nothin' that will muck it all up! That goes for you two. Tomorrow I will visit Iturralde's widow. - What if she doesn't sell? - The bitch will sell. - Mmmm. - Don't move, my son. - Jacinto, tell me what happened. - I was riding, then I found Ellie on the road to Santa Lucia. - Ellie? Who's Ellie? - She's a friend I met in town. We had to stop. Some guys were blocking the middle of the road. They were her brothers. - What? - Ellie told them not to shoot. That's all I remember. - But why did they shoot you? - I don't know. Maybe they were confused. - Howdy, half brother. - Howdy, Filthy. What're you doing down here? You surely have a problem, that's why you came down here. - That's right. You know why we came here. Now the army's getting in our way. Things are getting much worse. Jeronimo, Colchis and Indian Victoria have reunited. They will create a tribes union. We need more weapons. - Okay, I'm going to look for the smuggler. I will bring them to you. Do you have cash? - Of course we do. We have a whole lot of buffalo furs as well and gold we stole from miners in California. - Okay. Say hello to La Raza. - Okay. We will see you soon. - Miss Iturralde. Good morning, I'm Charles McKenzie. I'm real sorry what happened to your husband. I'm sure he was a great man and a loving father. - Thank you, Mr. McKenzie. Are you the person interested in buying the ranch? - Indeed, ma'am. You husband and I, we had a conversation about it. Unfortunately, we had a disagreement on it. - Will you please come in? - Indeed, ma'am. - Something to drink, sir? - Thank you, ma'am, but I'm fine. I wonder if your husband told you something about the proposal. We talked about it a full afternoon, we did. - He told me something about it. But tell me, Mr. McKenzie, why are you so interested in buying the ranch? - We have a very big company, all right? The headquarters are in New York City and we are now in an expansion process and incorporation of Texas to the U.S., well that gives us opportunities. We wanna join the Pacific with the Atlantic by the railroad. Does any of this make any sense? This zone is very important to us and your place is not the only property we are wishing to buy. There are more, all right? - My grandparents are buried in this place. My parents. My husband's parents and now he is buried here as well. Here are all my roots. Here I have all my history. Now I have no place else to go. - Just think about it, ma'am. We made a good proposal. Your daughters and you could move to a better and more peaceful place. I'm talking about the rest of your lives. - I will think about it, Mr. McKenzie. - Well, I have to thank you, ma'am. Excuse me, have a nice day. Well. - Huh? - There must be some other way to convince that widow. - Good morning. Is this the Villarreal's ranch? - Yes it is, se?orita. How may I help you? - Sorry, I'm Ellie. I'm a good friend of Jacinto. Just came to see how he was and brought him some cookies. - Sure, may I help you down? You have a visitor? - Visit? From who? - Oh shit. - Oh, hey! What? What're you doing? - I'm combing you. Can't you see that? Your hair looks like crap. - Stop it. Please! - Hey. You need to listen to me and listen to me well. The sister of the guys with whom I had a fight with at the store, she's right outside. Be careful, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - May I? - Ellie. Good to see you, come in. - How are you? - Please, sit down. - Jacinto, I'm really sorry about what happened with my brothers. It was a misunderstanding. They didn't want to do it, so... - Relax, it's okay. Fortunately, your brother is a bad shot. Besides, being from New York, you don't ride that badly. - Mmmmm. - You can't go in. - Excuse me? - What? - Jacinto has company. - Company from who? - From a girlfriend. - Girlfriend? Jacinto doesn't have a girlfriend. - Yes he does. Her name is Ellie. And she brought cookies. - Come on, girls, I don't want you to stay here alone. - Why are we going to town, Mama? - Your father left unfinished business and I have to send a telegram to Chicago. - Let's go. We hate this place, Mama. - I understand, sweetie. - I feel like everybody hates us just because we're Mexican. - That's true. Now some workers believe that they're the bosses now. I don't know why that is. - One worker told me, "Now that you live in my country, "you do it this way now." - Don't worry. You will get used to it. - I wanna live somewhere else. - But where? - I don't know where. Like Boston, Philadelphia, somewhere with more people. Here, this is what I wanna dedicate to. Fashion designer, right here. This is what I want to do. I don't want to stay here husking corn or making cheeses. - What about you, Elena? What do you want to do? - Me, I want to marry a rich millionaire. To never work again a day in my life. - Okay, if that is what you want. We're moving to the east. We're going to sell everything and start a whole new life. - Uh huh. - There I will meet my prince charming. - Yah! Yah! - We will have to have a farewell party for us. - We will invite the whole town. - We are still in mourning, dears, don't forget. - Yes, Mama. No! Help me, please! - I... Must... - Mama! Elena! - No! No, no, no! Oh God. Oh my God. - Wait here. Senora Iturralde, it's me, Ramon. - Come in. - Senora, I'm so very sorry. - What did we do to deserve this? - Whoever done it, we're going to catch them. Because, you see, I'm a man of my word. You see their faces? - Indians. They were Indians. - Collin! Wake up, let's go! - What? Oh yes, oh sorry, boss. - Hello there. Miss Villarreal. At your service. - Hola. - Martha, what happened? - Anna. - I want to die. - Don't say that. - Accord to Miss Iturralde, there were four or five Indians who attacked them. This happened just after leaving the ranch on their way to town. - They must be near. Let's go find them and hang them. Ain't that what we're here for? - I'm sure they're trying to escape through the mountain range. I need volunteers to go up there and drag them out. - You count me in. - I'm going too. - Me too. - Don't you think all this is very strange? Indians have never attacked our women before. They have always respected the agreement. - But now the Indians are really pissed off. The whites are stealing their lands. You think it's Chiricahua? We're losing time. The longer we take, the further they're gonna get away. Let's go get 'em. - I hope you're not going to commit an injustice, Ramon. - Yah! - Chiricahua, what're you doing here? - What did you do after I saw you yesterday? - What are you talking about? We were with the buyers. We sold them a lot of quality furs. What is it? - They're coming for you. - Why are they coming for us? - Three white women were raped yesterday. They say they were Indians. And there are no more Indians around here but you. You better get the hell out of here right now! - Too late, they are coming now! - Look! - You stay here. I'll go talk with them. - Chiricahua, what the fuck are you doing here? - He done told them that we were coming from him. Just remember, he's an Indian too. They didn't do it! - And how the fuck do you know that? - Because they were with me yesterday. - Oh yeah, so you could've been with them when they attacked the women. - Don't say shit, Samuel. We know each other. - An Indian is an Indian. He always will be. - You tell them to give up. - Only if you give them your word you won't hurt them. - Okay. Samuel, what the hell was that?! - Go get them. You better drop them guns. Let's kill 'em here, once and for all. - No! - Why not?! They did it! I'm sure of it! - You shoot them and you'll die. We're going to take them to town and they're going to have a fair trial. Good afternoon, Don Joaquin. - Good afternoon, Ramon. How can you be so sure that they did it? - They were in the same areas where the crime accord. - Oh yeah? That doesn't mean anything. They came to visit me yesterday. - You know people want revenge, Ramon. I hope you don't do something stupid. We must find the Indians who did this. - I'll go to where they were attacked. - Until then, I'll visit the Iturralde's. - That fucking Indian owes me one. - Cool it, brother. Remember what father told us. No scandals. - Okay. Okay. Everything's gonna be perfect, little brother. As soon as they lock up those Indians, it's all over. - That's right. It gets even better. I heard they won't even wait for a trial. They'll hang 'em before that. - God loves us, little brother. - Amen. - But listen, after this, the widow will surely sell. - Yeah and before they leave, I'd like to give another surprise to the daughter. - Me, the other one. - Marta, they caught some Indians and imprisoned them. The people want to lynch them. But we can't let another injustice take place. I know this is a nightmare for you but we need you to identify them. - All the tragedy that's happening in our community, in particular with the Iturralde family, it's because we have strayed from the path of God. Much like a lamb leaves the flock, we have let the devil inside our house like a plague. Those Indians really are innocents. It's Satan using them as instruments and the only way to free this family from the curse is to get closer to the church. Sharing their wealth to make the church greater and God will be grateful. Well. - What's going on? What the hell do you want? - Justice. - I'm writing this here letter. I'm requesting a judge to San Antonio to make sure these Indians get a fair trial. So why don't you get the hell out of here before I lock you all up?! Hey! Please, sit. Let's go. I said, let's go! - No! - Whoa! - What's wrong, Chiri? - I need a talk with you, Don Joaquin. - Ladies, I'll be right back. What did you find? - They weren't attacked by Indians. - What? - All the horses on the scene had horse shoes. No Indian rides a horse with horse shoes. They only ride wild horses, no saddle, bare hooves. - Follow me. Marta, could you see any of the attackers? Did you see their faces? What did they look like? - No, no. Everything happened so fast. And they had their faces covered. - Marta, they weren't Indians. - What? - They weren't Indians. They were white men disguised as Indians. - But how do you know that? - Chiricahua went back to the place where it happened and found tracks that now we know for sure. - But if they weren't Indians, who'd want to do something like this and why?! - I heard what all of you were saying. The Indian that attacked me, his face was covered with a cloth. I could see his eyes. They were as blue as the sky. Was he Indian, no! - On your knees. Kneel! Kneel! - Ramon, what happened here?! - He took them! - Where? - To the Encinos! - Let's go, Chiricahua! - Stand up. - Let them go! - Mm-mmm. - Let him down! Let him down! - Thank you, half blood, you saved our lives. - Don't come back here right now. Things are getting very ugly around here. - How could they not hang those goddamn Indians? - It was a Chiricahua that saved them. - We shoulda killed them in the store the other day. - You worthless fools! You should just be grateful he didn't kill you. - He got lucky, Dad. - Lucky? - This is one of the wells we discovered. We found it last week. The first one we found over there, so if we triangulate, beneath these spots, we'll find thousands of barrels. - We also searched behind those hills and the bushes over there look like the bushes over here, which means we have a pretty good chance of being in the right area. I think we'll find what we're looking for here. - So whose property is that? - That's the Villarreals. - How odd the Yankees are interested in this smelly thing. My ancestors used it to seal their canoes and to heal their wounds. What do they want it for? - Ellie? - Jacinto, what're you doing here? How did you get in? - The door was open. - Come in. What are you doing here? - I'm repaying the visit. But I didn't bring you any cookies. - Don't worry about it. And how are you? - Much better. Only a few more days to take it off. - Wow. What a lovely house. - Thank you. It's the furniture that my mom bought before she died in New York. And my dad wanted to bring them all here. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I miss her. - And what did you do with your boyfriend back in New York? - I didn't have a boyfriend in New York. - I don't believe that. A woman as beautiful as you I imagine had many suitors pursuing her. - Maybe. But I think my brothers scared them all away. - Mm-hmm. Tell me about it. - You know, I think that they're protective. They look after me. - I know. - Can I see? - Yeah. What? - I heard a noise! It's my brothers! - What?! - They're coming this way! - It's been a long-ass day, huh? - Here, come on. - Did you hear that? - No, I didn't. - Ellie? Are you okay? I thought I heard something. Like a bang. - Maybe I hit myself with a stool. - So why you laying down so early? - Billy, girl stuff, go away! Get out of here. - Okay. Jeez. It was Ellie. She's not feeling well. - What's going on? - You know, girl problems. - Girl stuff? What's that? - Don't be stupid now, Jimmy! - This? Is this yours, Billy? Mmmm. - Hey, come on. There's a door out front. If you take it, it leads to the kitchen. Let's go! - Damn it. - Julia, come here, please. - Coming, Miss Ellie. - Ellie! What is this, here?! - What are you saying, Bill? That you think I'm hiding someone? - Aye! - Good evening, Professor. - Hello, Chiri. Sit down, please. - Thank you. - So, are you ready to study now? - Well I... Well I... Real soon. I wanted to ask you something. - Tell me. - What's the name of that black thing that comes from the grounds there on our fields? The one they fix wagons and canoes with. - Oil. Crude oil. - That's the one. - Hold on. Ah, yes. There's the one. Read this, please. - A.... A... A... You know very well that I cannot read. - And why is that? - Because I never went to class. - Well, tell me what you need to know. - Why is this oil so valuable that the Yankees fight? - Well, here it says that "Oil, once distilled, "creates another type of oil that can be used as lamp fuel." Here's something interesting. "Recently, "a machine called internal combustion was invented, "which will use oil as fuel. "This invention will soon replace "the steam-powered machines we know." My dear Chiri, these machines will revolutionize the whole world and oil will be essential for this to happen. - Come in. - Good day, Don Joaquin. - What's up? What's the news? Have a seat. - In the morning I saw these new neighbors, the McKenzie's, got into the Iturraldes' farm. - The McKenzie's? The ones who want to buy the farm from Marta Iturralde? - That's the one. - What were they doing there? - I asked the same question. And it turns out what they want from the Iturraldes' farm, it ain't the livestock or the land. It's what comes from the ground. - What's that? - That black stuff that kills our grass, our animals and poisons the water we drink. - You mean oil. - That's it. - How do you know that? - Because I followed them. I heard them talk about it. They were talking about thousands and thousands of barrels. They were talking about money and I learned from the professor that this thing is gonna be worth a lot. One more thing, I'm sure the McKenzie's are the ones who killed Don Laureano and raped his family, his two daughters, the poor things. - I've been thinking the same thing. But I don't really wanna cause any trouble until I'm sure I know all the facts. Call Jacinto, please. - Mm-hmm. - What's up, Dad? - Sit down, my son. I know you've been seeing Charles McKenzie's daughter and I want you to stop seeing her. - But why? - Charles McKenzie and his boys are dangerous people. And, remember, they almost killed you. - But that was an accident. - They're capable of anything and I'm quite certain that they killed your uncle Laureano and are responsible for the attack of Marta and her daughters. - But how do you know it was them?! - Jacinto, listen to what I'm saying! I don't want you to see that girl anymore! Do you understand?! Jacinto! Get back here! - No! - You want me to talk to him? Maybe he will listen. - All right. - Wait here. - Where are you going? - See the farm. It's going to be ours, isn't it? - Who are you? What do you want?! - I'm Bill. Bill McKenzie. We're the ones who are buying your farm. - Please, get out of here. - Have a nice day. I hadn't realized how pretty Miss Iturralde's daughter is. I saw her back there. - Yeah? - I think she loves me. - Miss Iturralde, I know it's not the best time after what happened but it's such a horrible thing, I'm deeply sorry. - Mr. McKenzie, I am willing to sell everything to you. The only thing we want is for you to leave this town. - Well, if you don't mind, I'll bring the contract by later today. Excuse me. - Don't be stupid, Bill. Not here. - Good evening. I'm Joaquin Villarreal. - Good evening, Mr. Villarreal. I didn't have the pleasure. I'm Mr. McKenzie. These are my sons, Bill and Jimmy. - He is Chiricahua, my foreman. I've learned that you are interested in buying Miss Iturralde's hacienda. - We've reached an understanding. For her benefit, of course. - It's a shame this understanding came after the death of my friend, Laureano Iturralde, and the unfortunate attack on his wife and daughters. - Yes, I was told. I heard this was a wild and violent area. - Exactly, Mr. McKenzie. This was a quiet town until certain kinds of settlers arrived and turned it into a hellhole. By the way, I'm sure you know my son got shot by one of your boys. - That was a terrible mistake, friend. They thought they were protecting their younger sister. - I understand, Mr. McKenzie. I suggest you keep an eye on your daughter. There's a band of rapists dressed like Indians and we're hot on their trail. And I'm going to be there when they hang them. - Well thank you for warning me, Mr. Villarreal. We will be careful. - Pow. - Ellie, if your brothers had found me in your house that day, what would they have done with me? - I don't know, Jacinto. - Would they have killed me? - Of course not. If you're saying this because of the misunderstanding the other day, I told you it was an accident. - There've been a lot of strange things going on here. - And what are you saying? That my family had to do with that? - My dad thinks so. Wait, of course I don't believe him. And if they are, I don't care. I love you. - Jacinto, I think I'm pregnant. - What? - Marta, I'm sure the McKenzie's are involved with everything that has happened here. - I don't care! I want to get out of here! - We can't let them get away with this! - Understand, Joaquin! I beg of you! My daughters are terrified! For them, this has been a nightmare and staying here, it would be like living a nightmare every day. Please understand for me. My daughters are so scared that they don't even want to leave the house. Did you know that? - No, Joaquin. We are leaving! - We're going to miss you a lot, Juanita. - I'm going to miss you too. - Take care, Marta. - I want to go, yeah. - Rafa, he wants to go with you. - Well, come on! - Yeah. - Thank you. - Be careful. There you are. - Rafa, we leave. - We will. We will take the family, then we will come home. - Muah! - That's right. That's right, let's go. - That's a fine guy. - We'll have to do this more. Yes. - Finally, the McKenzie's got their way and I'm sure they won't stop there. - Come on. Keep moving. - These people, they have no limits. - How exciting, Mom. Finally, we're moving to civilization. - That's right, darlings, are you happy? - Of course, Mom, we needed it. - Yes, Mom, a lot. - What's happening? What now? - Calm down. - What's going on, Mom? You go! You go now! Far away! You go! Go! Not one day had passed of taking over the hacienda when the McKenzie's had already started drilling for oil. McKenzie was a smart man. He immediately got involved with the governor of Texas. A so-called J.W. Henderson. He gave him a lot of money for his campaign. He had the whole thing in his hand. Even made him build the railroad tracks next to his land. And if that wasn't enough, he even made him the town mayor. Who do you think owned the railroad? Well, who else? - So what's the problem then? - 15 kilometers from where we are we have these hills and we have to surround them like that. Otherwise we have to build a 200 meter tunnel. - Yeah, what's the problem then? - This property owner right there is Joaquin Villarreal. I don't think he'll sell us one inch. - We have to convince him because building a 200 meter tunnel is gonna take too much cash, and most importantly, time. - That's right. And in this area, this is where we had the oil spring. - Mmmmm. - Good morning, Don Joaquin. - Good morning, Ramon. I'm scared of your visits now. - Unfortunately, I don't bring good news, Don Joaquin. They found the coach where Miss Iturralde and her daughters were traveling. It was empty. It was found 200 miles from here. They were headed to Kansas. - Yes, I know. - I'm here to ask Chiricahua if he can help us find their tracks. - Let's go. - I'll go with you. - They dropped here. These boot tracks and some smaller shoes too, women shoes. Oh, the stagecoach was lighter from here on. - Hey, Bill, they found the women. What're we gonna do? - Don't worry, Jim. Dad is the most influential man in town. Besides, we have the governor's blessing. They can not touch us. - But those scratches on your neck. There's no way you did them with barbwire. - Have you seen your wrist? This and your wrist, it's all because the whores upstairs. We talk to them, give them a little bit of money and it's done. - If they don't agree? - They will agree. - What if our asshole dad finds out? - Dad? Are you kidding me? He has more to worry about than us. - Ellie! - Jacinto, what're you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Over here, come. - We need to leave town, Ellie. - Why, what're you saying? - Things are going to get dangerous here. - I'm going to tell my father and brothers the truth, that I'm pregnant. They will understand. - You don't get it! It's going to get dangerous between our families. Your brothers did something terrible that can get them hanged! - What's the matter, Jacinto? You're scaring me. - Promise me you won't tell anyone about this. You brothers killed the Iturralde woman, the mother and both sisters. They raped and murdered them and afterwards, they buried them near here. - No, no, that can't be true. They're not capable of doing something like that. - Your father ordered the murder of Don Laureano because he refused to sell his land. The widow accepted but he killed them anyway. - No. I don't believe anything that you say. - Your brothers are crazy, Ellie! There's been a whole investigation. I was there. See if your brothers have any wounds or scratches made by a woman. Think about it but we need to decide quickly. - Shot. - Here you go. - How you doin', boys? Relax. There is a Colt 45 under the table aiming straight at your huevos. I have a sensitive finger. Any movement from the hand and the only thing left for you to scratch will be your head and the bullet will come out of your asshole. That goes for you too, Jimmy. Put your hands on the table very slowly. - You have no idea who you're messing with, Indian. - No. I know exactly who I'm dealing with. Some assholes that raped and killed three defenseless women. - What you talking about? - I wonder what the judge will think about all this. - Get on your feet and raise your hands slowly, right now! - You Mexicans are such pendejos. And you, filthy Indian, you're a dead man. - Who's the pendejo now? - I'm going to kill you! - I want you to release my two boys immediately! - Your boys are detained for rape and murder of the Iturralde women. We are waiting for the judge to start the trial. - By the order of Governor Henderson, himself, release my sons or you'll be replaced and sent to Austin for contempt. - Where's the judge we were waiting for? - They sent him back, Don Joaquin. - The law is in the hands of the McKenzie's. - Mm-hmm. - We are unprotected against that family of murderers. - I say we give them some of their own medicine. - We aren't murderers, Chiricahua. - We're not as long as we are defending ourselves. - Now I warned you! I don't want anymore bullshit! This favor I asked the governor for is gonna cost me a lot! - We didn't do anything, Dad. - With so many goddamn women in this town, you go and mess around with the Iturralde's. And to top it off, you gotta go kill them?! - I swear, Dad, we didn't do... - You are my son, dumbass! You think you can fool me now?! You are my blood and I know you are capable of that and more! - What's going on here? You're all insane! You're all killers! - Darlin'! Darin', come back here. - Yah! Yah! Yah! - Where'd Ellie go? - She rode off, sir. - Go get her! Run! Run now! - Oh yeah, okay. - You were right, Jacinto. My family is crazy, they're murderers. Let's go. - Let's go right now, my love. - Take me wherever you want. - First we must go to my house and get some things. Let's go. Ellie, wait for me. I'll go get my stuff and we can leave. - Jacinto, what're you doing? - I'm leaving. - What do you mean, you're leaving? Jacinto! - What's going on? - Jacinto leaving. - What do you mean Jacinto is leaving? Where'd he go? - I don't know, he just took his things and ran off. - Well, let's go, come on! Jacinto, what do you mean, you're leaving? - I'm going with Ellie, Mom. Ellie, come here. - You're crazy! Where do you think you're going? - I don't know, Ma, north? - Your family doesn't know, do they? - Jacinto, her family's going to find you and they are going to kill you. - Ellie's pregnant. - Do you think that they care at all if stays along with the baby? - We need to leave, Ellie. Goodbye, Mama. So long, Mama. - Come in. - Senor McKenzie. Ellie ran away with the Villarreal boy. - Where are they headed? - I heard up north, sir. - Call my sons. - Yes, sir. Um... - Didn't you hear me? Call my sons! - Yes, sir, but I also heard that she is... She's pregnant. Damn! Get out! - Dad, Jacinto is gone. - What do you mean, Jacinto's gone? - I'm telling you, he left with Elle, McKenzie's daughter. - What?! - Yes, Joaquin, the girl is pregnant. I don't blame Jacinto. I would've done the same. But not having brothers-in-laws like the McKenzie's, either way, he got Mr. McKenzie's daughter pregnant. Where have I heard that story before? - The McKenzie's will surely go after them and they have many reasons to hurt him. We'll go up north. We'll catch up with them there. - When I was little, my mom died. I went from boarding school to boarding school. That's why I never spent time with my family. I didn't know what kind of people they were. - I got lucky. My family is pretty normal. - Well, yeah, for Mexicans, family is very important. But not for Saxons. For them, money's more important. - You should be Mexican. - Well, I have a little one inside. - The horses are really tired. We should rest them. Besides, it's getting late, we should find shelter. How did you sleep? - Wonderfully. - Me too. I can't believe we're doing this, together. Let's grab our things. Honey, let's hurry up. It's not long to Austin. There, we can get something to eat. - One moment. How much did you get for the horses? - Not much, honey, but with these horses, I don't think they'll find us. Hey, someone's coming. - Who could it be? - I don't know but we're not gonna stay here to find out. - Jacinto, are you crazy?! - Stay away! Ellie and I are going north! - Damn you, Jacinto! Take cover! - They're coming this way, boss! - You two, over there! Let's cover the hill! - Hey, Jim, go around me, catch him from the back. - Those are your brothers. I have to help my father. Wait for me here. - Please! Don't, don't shoot me! - Don Joaquin! - I'm fine, it's just a flesh wound. - Mr. Villarreal, nice to see you again. - Ellie, we are very sorry it ended this way. Truly sorry. - Well, I'm not because I have a new family and I drink to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. - And a toast, for my niece that needs to be named Juanita, like her auntie. And if he is a boy, call him Juan. - And why doesn't anyone ask the Mama? - Well, if it's a girl, it'll be Elena, like my mother-in-law. - Than you, Ellie. - And if it's a boy, Chiricahua. Thanks for everything. - Cheers. - Chiri, what's your real name anyway? - I have no idea. The Mexican population in Texas in 1848 was approximately 78 hundred people and now their numbers are 9.8 million. Adaptarea: Legendofmir Traducerea: DOOMNEZEU
