Dad, eat. Just have a little. Dad, eat something. The number you have dialed is not- District 8, but what ward is it in? How am I supposed to read that? Which ward? Cao Xuan Duc. Cao Xuan Duc street is over here. Cao Xuan Duc is ward 13 or 12. Thank you. Go down and straight all the way down. - Go down there and ask. - Okay. Go back and go straight down to the intersection. Thank you. Excuse me... is there a Lisa here? Sorry, you must have the wrong place. There's no one named Lisa here. My friend's name is Lisa, this is her address. You must have the wrong address, there's no Lisa here. Excuse me, but she told me to come work here. We have enough staff here, we're not looking. You have the wrong address, ask your friend again. Are you hiring anyone right now? She's asking if you're hiring anyone. - If you're hiring! - No. - No, sorry, I'm not. - Okay, thank you. Do you need anyone to wash dishes or clean? I have enough help now. We needed someone the other day, but now we're fine. Okay, thank you. Excuse me, are you looking to hire anyone? Huh? - Are you hiring? - No, no, we are okay. You ID card is a bit worn out. - You're from Dak Lak? - Yes. Can you pay in advance? 50,000 VND, right? No, rooms here are 250,000 VND. I saw outside that they were 50,000 VND. 50,000 is the hourly rate. It's 250,000 per night. Are you going to take it? Ok, thank you. Ah, excuse me, are you hiring? No, sorry. HIRING WAITER Suong. Come over here. There is where you'll sleep with the other two girls. Okay. Come out here with me. - Do you have your ID card? - I do. Can I borrow it? Why is it all faded and soggy? It got wet. Hmm, let me ask at the police station if they'll accept it. Come over here with me. - Vi! - Yes? Show her around, okay? And the bathroom, it has to be cleaned, okay? Anh does that, not me. - Whatever, just show her how to work, okay? - Okay, okay. I'm going home, okay? Okay. Customers are coming in. You twist it around three times... Not more. Then fold it down. - Why's there so much chanting from the temple today? - Yes, only three times. Fold it down. You'll get a hang of it soon. To eat in? The yellow bag is for one box, and these are for two boxes. The ones for three boxes are over there, four and five as well. Over here. The white bags. Those are for three or more boxes. Here, put these inside. Then put some chilis in. Take out the spoon-Oh my god… If you put rice in you have to take out the spoon! If I say three boxes, you go and get the bags right away. Then put in hot sauce, a spoon, and soup. And if they ordered fried chicken, add fish sauce, up here. - For shrimp too. - And you gotta work fast. Okay. Don't forget, okay? These are for the dishes, one for cleaning, one for rinsing. Then you stack them. Big plates, small plates, bowls, all separately. Okay? Look up. Look towards the ceiling. Don't blink! It gets everywhere. Look up! All the way up! It's not staying on her skin or anything. I applied so much and she's still so dark. Probably her first time wearing make-up. I'll use your blusher, okay? Whatever, I'll just put on some lipstick. - Watch the road! - I give up! Just drop it! Don't you care about me? I've been craving all morning. Just smoke when we get there. - Put it out? - Just drop it. - It's Xuan? - Suong. - Suong. - Yeah. Umm... Hey buddy! Buddy! Hey! Just a second! Lemme ask you... - How much were those teeth? - None of your business. - Come one, I'm just asking. - Whatever, just drop it. Show us how you use your teeth. - Show me your teeth! - So rude. Look at mine! Let's see, open your mouth. Look, here. Ohhhh, let's cheers! What? [VI] So what was it? All of it. [VI] She can't hear what we're saying. She's not listening. Like this? Finish it off. Two, three, cheers! Two, three, cheers! Two, three, bottoms up! Cheers! Two, three, cheers! Two, three, bottoms up! You know the answer already, why are you asking? Hey, you have Facebook? Suong? Yes, I do. We're out of bags. I'll go get some, just a second. Are there any in that bag? What's your name? Add me. Where's your phone? But my phone lags a lot. It's not turning on! Just a sec, I'll go get one. Add me so later it won't cost you to call. Why isn't it working? [Huy] Hey, Suong. [Vi] It's so damn hot in here. [Mother] What's the matter? [Suong] Have you eaten? Huh? Have you eaten yet? Not yet. Has Dad eaten yet? Not yet, I'm cooking right now. What are you making? Nothing, just plain fish. What are you doing today? Huh? What are you doing today? Weeding and shooing the chickens away. Looking after them. Mum, I have to go. There's one over there. Here. Here too. Look, look, over here. Pull down. Move the stick to the side and pull! Yeah, like that. Look there's one more. Eating too much sugar is bad for you. You can die from diabetes. Kids love this. Yeah, my son loves it. - Have you seen my son yet? - No. I'll show you. He's adorable. Cute, eh? - Handsome, huh? - Yeah. We look alike, don't we? What do you mean no? We're identical. So handsome. Oh, I love him so much. Bring him sometime. He barely knows how to speak yet. He can only say “mama” and “papa” now. - Ack, so sour! - Maybe next year, I'll bring him here. Ah, so sour! If he likes it, we can make it, or ask Suong to... so you can end him some, don't buy it, no? Oh, I forgot. I was going to send money home today but I forgot. Remind me tomorrow, okay? Ah, Vi, how do you send money home? I send it by bank transfer. Or you can go to the bus station... find somebody you know and send it with them. Or you can send by courier, it's pretty fast, I use it. I don't think I know how to. Then go down the bus station like Vi said. But if you send it by bus, does it cost money? Of course. If they send it for you, they have to charge a fee. Let me ask around for you at the bus station. I'll see if someone I know is going to your town. I'll ask for you. Okay. Suong, do you know how to use Google Maps? No. Come, I'll show you. Where's your phone? For when you have to go deliver food. I'm pressing it, but it's not working. Ok, you do it. So, the address we usually deliver to, enter it in here. Pork delivery! Bring it inside, please. It's 430,000 VND. Miss! Food delivery! Two chicken, two fish. 100,000 VND. Thank you. Miss, food delivery! Just leave it there, dear. Give one box to the woman's house next door. - Okay. - Thank you. Miss. Who are you looking for? I'm delivering food from Mrs. Phuong. Ah, yes, Mrs. Phuong. Thank you. Have a seat. It's okay. - What are you doing? - My phone got wet. Give it to me, I'll do it. What are you going to do? Put it in rice for a couple days and it'll work. Just like that? Mmhmm. Go and get changed. You're getting the floor all wet. Don't forget, okay? Okay, close it. Remember to close this as soon as it rains or everything will get wet. Okay that's enough. Put the rope here. So, after you do the dishes, unclog the drain. Every day. Because it floods a lot during rainy season. I do all of it? Who else? Huy, Huy, let me ask you a favour. I just bought this but it's not working. - What's wrong? - I don't know, it's not working. Here, I can't connect it. Made in China, right? Probably. Is it working? Look, now it's working. Suong, you finished? Look at that! Thank you! Suong, bring this inside first, then clean up. Okay. [Mrs. Phuong] Ten... Fifteen... Twenty... Thirty... - Yours is 3,250,000 VND. - Thank you. - Coming for dinner tonight? - We'll see. Twenty…Thirty… Yours is 3,850,000 VND. - And another 200,000 VND for your son. - Thank you. - Here's 150,000 VND for expenses. - Yeah. - Give 50,000 VND to Ms. Sau, okay? - Okay. Here's your money, dear. For 12 days of work. Thank you. I'll pay you in full at the end of next month, okay? Okay. Okay, I'm going home. Are you coming back? No, I have some work to do. [Mother] Hi, dear. Mom, I just got paid. How much, dear? 1,200,000 VND. Why so little? If the salary is that low come back and work here. - But- - Instead of being over there. But, it's only the starting salary. Sang just started working for Mr. Tuan. She'll get 4 million a month. Come home this weekend, okay? What's the point of staying there? Your salary is so low! I'm going to go eat. I'll call you another time. Here, Anh. Did you call? Yeah. [Ms. Sau] Phi Nhung isn't as good as Nhan. Nhan's singing is more melancholic and better. This one's voice is higher. This is Phi Nhung? Phi Nhung and Manh Quynh. Clean up for me. I'm going to make dinner. Come up when you're done. Okay. Ah, gently! Oh my god. - You broke it? - It's okay, just cut the skin around it. - Just the skin? - Mhm. You broke it too close. - Fine, just cut it then. - Okay, so cut it? Ahh, just a bit. Okay, slowly. - You going too, Anh? - Take your time, so it looks nice. Tonight we're going to the birthd-Ow! Gently. It's stuck on there. Cut it. Oh my god, my toenail... - How'd you break it so badly? - I don't know. It broke right at the edge. Probably dancing or something. - Lightly! - Mhmm. - It hurts! - I'm doing it gently. [Customer] For 15,000 VND, I get two eggs, right? [Anh] You'll take the rice first, right? [Customer 2] Where's Vi? Yes, you get two eggs. She's still sleeping. [Customer 2] Tell her to meet me there. How many boxes did she order? One order of rice. - But she's coming back later, right? - Yes. - Five orders of chicken. - Two is 44,000 VND. Anything else? Whose order is this? Get me 200k change. Here's the change. Get 4,000 VND, dear. Get me another 100,000 VND. How much is the change for this? Thank you. Oops, sorry, excuse me. Three boxes, whose three boxes are these? - These three are yours? - Yes, that's right. Here's one, did you include the pickles yet? Here, here, I put them in already. [Vi] Why don't you use the washing machine? I don't have a lot of clothes. - Have you cleaned upstairs yet? - Yes. You can have the day off tomorrow. I'll cover for you. Wow, going to meet the President? So dressed up! All good from the ankles up, but a weird down there, huh? - Oh, Suong, I forgot. - Yeah? Are you going to District 1? Yeah, probably. Can you do me a favour? This whitening cream. See if you can find it. I couldn't find it around here. Okay. Do you need to write it down? No, it's okay. Don't forget. - Okay, go on then. - See you. Excuse me, is the salary here 5 or 7 million VND? That, I don't know. The interviewer will let you know. Excuse me, what do I write here? Places you've worked before. Can you move over? This is my work area. - Can I do the interview this afternoon? - No, sorry. HR will call you. And your picture? You have to attach it. Can I bring it to you another day? But I only have today off. I don't know. You can give me your phone number. I will call you when my boss returns. I don't have a phone. I want to help you, but I'm not even sure how to. What if I sit and wait here? If you want to then… You can wait outside. Otherwise, you can come back at 2pm. Excuse me, has your boss returned yet? Not yet. You can come back tomorrow. But you said he'd be back at 2pm. I don't know, he's the boss. Vi! Hey, Vi! Vi! Do you know what time it is? I've been trying to call you all day. I haven't fixed my phone yet. I couldn't find your cream. You've been gone all day and still haven't found it? There's a pile of dishes over there. Go wash them. Can I wash them tomorrow? So the mice can crawl all over them? Wash them and then go to bed. Vi! Suong! The whole house is flooded! Vi! Suong! [Vi] Where's the plunger? [Anh] It's on the shelf, over there! Get it, Suong! Where's Suong? Go and help! Damn it! Why didn't you turn the freezer off? Did you unplug it? Dump it into the street, who cares! - [Vi] It's better than inside. - [Anh] It's flooded outside too. It's better than in the house! Where do you think the water came from? From outside! Whatever! - Have you checked the front, Anh? - I put everything up already! Man, this thing… Whatever, let's just put it on top of here. Just put it on here before it breaks! What do you mean it's broken? It hasn't turned on since this morning. I tried to plug it in already. I tried it already. So what about the food? I guess we take the box and put some ice in it for now. Three of you, and this still happened? How? It flooded and broke, that's all. I don't know. Suong, get me the box, please. Why didn't you take care of it before it got to this point? Huy's coming by later. I'll ask him to fix it. Huy, can you bring us some ice? Okay, thanks. But you already know that it floods in here when it rains. Careful, the ladder. How'd you let everything get flooded and ruined? The freezer's already old and it was going to break anyway. What do you mean it was old? You were meant to take care of it! - How am I supposed to take care of it? - It rains for everyone, not just us. Everyone else's house floods and so ours will too! We try to fix it and you buy a new one if we can't fix it. That's why I put you in charge! How'd you let it get to this point? Now everything's ruined, what are you going to do? I put you in charge. If you're not to blame, then who is? It's the weather, it's not my fault. Why do you keep blaming me? Take care of it, stop blaming others. I called you to buy a new freezer so we'll have something to sell- What do you mean buy? You think these things are cheap? These things cost money. You think they're cheap? So what will we sell? We'll have no food to sell. Food will go bad and then what? - You were in charge, you fix it. - It's your restaurant! It's mine, but you were here, you were supposed to take care of it. All you do is talk back to me when I talk to you. What else do you want me to do? You don't know what's right or wrong. You were in charge, take some responsibility. The three of you find a solution. - You just put all the responsibility on us! - All you do is run your mouth when I talk to you! It's okay, when Huy comes back, we'll ask him if he can fix it. I don't care, the three of you sort it out. If you can't fix it, the three of you can go buy me a new freezer. What? Why would we have to do that? It's your freezer not ours. I put you in charge so it's your responsibility. Sort it out. Find a solution and stop whining. We're done here. [Huy] Nah, it can't be fixed. - [Vi] Why not? - It's broken. Call your technician friends, tell them to fix it. It won't make a difference. These things break. Just buy a new one. What? Are you kidding me... Did you fix it? No, no. The freezer is broken. You broke it, you pay for it. I told you to unclog the drain and you didn't. You let the place flood. The freezer can't be fixed. But I unclogged it! When? Then how did it flood? I did it yesterday. When? You were gone all day yesterday! If you did it, it wouldn't have flooded. Calm down, why are you yelling at her? The freezer costs over 3 million. You take it out of your salary then! Take it out of your wedding savings. I don't have that kind of money. Whoever broke it has to pay for it. You can't expect us all to pay. - But it wasn't my fault! - Then whose fault is it? I told you to unclog the drain after doing the dishes. And you didn't do it. I don't have money. My money is for my son. This is yours. Here's the fish sauce. How much? I'm just letting you know, but it's up to you. It's the same wherever you go. We have to take care of our things. We don't just let things break and we're told off, get upset and just leave. Have you thought about it carefully? Huh? Yes. I'll let you think about it for one more day. Okay? And come talk to me tomorrow. Up to you, okay? If you work or not, it's up to you. I'll let you think about it today. And we'll talk tomorrow. If you quit, I'll give you your salary and you can go. Mrs. Phuong? What is it? May I get my salary? Hey dear! Hey! Delivering food? Yes. Ms. Sau said you can just put it here. You don't have to go in, dear. Miss Sau! Hey Miss Sau! Food's here! Okay, we're going to retake the last shot. Sit up a little. Look down a bit. Turn your head a little. Take off your backpack. Adjust your collar. Sit up straight. Look into the camera. Don't smile. Here you go. Thank you. Excuse me, may I have a glass of warm milk? Okay. May I use the bathroom? Yes, go ahead. Suong! Hey Suong! Suong! Hey Suong! What are you doing here? Go home and sleep. Let's go. Go home and sleep. Come on, you can't sleep in a café. We've been to this place before. But I'm not going to drink! It's okay, come hang out and we'll go home. I told them I'd come. Okay? Two or three beers then we'll go. I'm not going to drink though. It's okay, just come hang out. Okay? Let's drink! Drink it all! Come on! Everyone drinks! Bottom's up! Yeah! So good! Huy's so weird today... I was thinking- - So... I was thinking to sign up... - What are you talking about? To be a bike taxi driver. 'Cos now, as a shipper, I don't earn much and keep getting bumped. There's something wrong with this guy today. Oh my god... Have a drink. C'mon, just a sip! - Come on! - No. - Whatever, it's cold, let's cheers. - Drink to warm up. - Cheers! - Cheers! - I have some water. - No, no. Let's go. - Dak Lak? - Yes. Dak Lak is over there by the front. Up over there. Excuse me, sir! Are you Mr. Binh? The one who drives to Dak Lak? That's right. Miss Vi said you can send things to Dak Lak? - Which Vi? - Vi from the restaurant. Ah Vi from District 8, that's right. There's a phone number on it. Okay. What time will it arrive? This bus arrives in Dak Lak around 4-5pm. Can I have your phone number? Ah, you don't trust me? First time sending, right? Here you go. Thank you.
