Hey but you have to stay here, man. Good morning. Fortunately the world has not ended. We are still here. As they said from the beginning, it was all just a story.

I think it's fucking up, man! And what happens if you take of the patch and your nose is backwards? Or even worse, you have a big black hole on your face? Shut up, bitch. Who knows? Have you even touched it? It's gonna be all right. know what I want to do next? My eyebrows. Both of them. Hey, have you heard about the Ukrainian Barbie? Let's see. Its a girl that's had 52 surgeries to look like Barbie. Look. Woah, she's huge. And those tits. Barbie doesn't have that much tits, though, right? Look. Here it says: real life Barbie reveals she holds communication with aliens through... ... the language of light. Here she is meditating... ... next to the sea. -She's meditating! Hey, and what about your guy? I don't have a guy. What do you mean you don't? That one you're always talking to. He's called Junior and I haven't even seen him in real life. But you've seen him. Through a webcam. And how was it? Well, he was jerking off when I met him. And how was it? It was long and thin. And you know cameras add some weight So really it's a one centimeter thick spaghetti. That's awful! - Hey, you want some more? There's barely any left. What are you doing these days? Well I just finished school so I want to do nothing as much as posible... ... although I also did a lot of that when I was in school. Can I ask you for a favor? What? Can you cover me at work? No way. Just for a few days! -Sure, but no more than two days. -Yeah. Two days. Chiripa, my bro... What's up? What's up, man? How've you been? Good. I haven't been here for a while because I was out of cash but... I have something here that might be worth something. Worth something for whom? For you, man. What I'm holding right here is worth cash. Yeah, right. Dude: asses. Asses right on the spot. Listen, can I come in? All your hotel stuff isn't half as good as this. These are real asses. Asses in real time. I have a friend in a wheelchair. We just go around and film whatever we want. These are little girls, man. Little girls with firm hot asses. Lets see, lets see. Where's the film? -Show me. -Why so skeptical? This is grade-A material I'm giving you. Look, I even put a picture on it. Look, when you've been my client there's always been a thing... Dude, people want asses. No, man. I've already told you asses are for web pages. To upload into some virtual world. Now you know actual pornography swings another way. Listen. When I'm jerking off and I see a dick, I get demoralized. I could be right about to cum but as soon as I see a dick it's over, man. I don't want dicks, I want asses. Here I'm bringing you some asses you could jerk off to for twenty minutes straight. No, people just watch amateur footage because of some voyeur thing. I don't think it's about being excited. I don't think people get off on watching cholas. -People laugh. -You're not a jerkoff like me, man. What we want is to jerk off right, we get bored of always jerking off to the same things. We want to find something that will encourage us to keep on jerking off, you know? Something to make us feel alive! That is what I'm offering you right now. Asses. In real time. But this doesn't provoke, dude. - I get turned on! I wanna watch this! That's what I've been telling you. - What have I done with you... You're a businessman. - You know what you're lacking there, bro? Dude, in Japan this thing is hot! You should contact someone in school. Someone there who has a camera... - They'll get the job done. -Ok, look They've shown me cooler stuff than yours -I'll bring you something real. -Ok. With the girl I'm going out with right now. She's really hot and also a schoolgirl. Alright, great! That's more like it. I've just got stuff with schoolgirls fucking. Ok, but listen. If I do this, I want to make a deal with you. Yeah, yeah. Sure. But it has to be real sex, hard, strong and ruthless. All that. You want that shit, huh? I'll do it. And all that mixed with innocence. It's that mix that... -And she has the cutest face. -Ok, perfect. -Hey -Sup -Hey, look man. -What's up? Notice any difference? Because you're wearing glasses? You're baked. It's really weird, man. It's like the other way around: instead of losing them they suddenly appeared. I don't know, but it's like I've been telling you: weird things are happening. It's getting freaky. -Cheers. -Cheers, thanks. -I should call Luz, right? -Yeah. Luz, Luz! Come. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming! Goddamn it! A toast? -I like seeing you guys. Really. -Cheers! -Konichiwa -What's up. Hey, is Rosa here? Do you know her? She's my friend. I'm covering for her. Why isn't she here? She wasn't feeling good. Ok. I got something for her. Some trips. We'd talked about going to the Huaca for some time now but she doesn't answer my calls. Does she have your number? No, that's why I want to give it to you. Ok, sure. I'll write it down. Ok, it's 987 63 510. -What's your name? -My name's Mike. Great. I'll tell her to call you. Great. Where do you know her from? From her previous life -Hey -Hi. Are you the guy who called? Yes I called, but... I felt odd. It's another fee for young girls, huh! As if I were in a phony Peruvian movie. What, you're curious or something? Well, what do you want? Want to fuck? Sure. Whatever. It's actually my birthday. Really? Yeah, and I wanted to give myself a gift. Something I hadn't done before. So I'm your gift? Well, look. This is how you suck it, look. With the moaning and all. Right. I can't do that. -It's yummy. -Suck it some more. Wait. I bit it. As a matter of fact our encounter changed her somewhat. I'm even gonna help her make her web site. Alright. Well, I hope you join us. It'll be fun. Ok. -Are you gonna order? -It's all right. -Bye. -Goodbye. -What's that, man? -See? Holy shit, man. Fuck, just when I thought I'd seen everything... -Always something new. -You surprise me. Where do you find this shit? You're something, man. I bet you didn't sleep because you were too busy jerking off. Not yet. It's clean. Totally clean. This is gonna be a success. - Good dough -I think we should make a hundred copies right off the bat. Wait, hold on. I got a message. Shit man, look The one I told you about. Holy shit, holy shit! LIBERTY HOSTEL 5 pm. Hey man, I gotta go. I told you, man. Fuck yeah! Finally! Listen: you make the copies... ... and we'll meet up at night. -You stay here with your little monster while I go get some. I'm gone! So what happened to that guy? Well, the first time we were supposed to meet up at the LIBERTY HOSTEL. I sent him a picture on Facebook. I drew a huge cock on my leg so he would get horny. LIBERTY HOSTEL -I ended up screwing it up. I pussied out. -What? -I didn't show up. -You suck, girl! You just stood him up? Didn't he get upset? What was he gonna say? We haven't even seen each other in real life yet. Well yeah, that's true. So I just made up some story. I said I had my period that day. So we weren't even gonna be able to do anything. But the last time I did show up. That time I went and decided to fuck him. Yeah, I swear. I've always been curious to be with some one - No! I don't wanna be with him but... I guess someone older has more depth, is more interesting... He came with an Obama t-shirt! Come on! I grabbed his butt. Hi... what's up? So we went to this bar where they sell drinks from the jungle. On Petit Thouars, yes. We drank together... Oh, gee, how weird! Shit, I can give you some of mine. I wonder what's gonna happen It's so weird to see him in person. But he seems cool. Yum, so good. Does he have crowfeet? What? I like to sleep, to dream. I do dream a lot. I dream every night. The more I wake up during the night, the better... Because my dreams change, get tangled and transform themselves. Maybe that's why I like the Internet. It's as strange... We were talking shit, anyway every night we stayed up chatting until 4 am. Suddenly to see him in person... Last night I saw his cock on my computer and now he's there walking towards me. So weird. What's up? Should we get going? Yeah, please. I wanna fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! So yeah, we went to the drugstore. Well, WE didn't go. I went. Because this dude... he's nuts. We went to some motel with the condom I bought, but we couldn't pay for it. We had 12 bucks between the two of us! No fuckin' way! That's enough for a cave. Nothing, so that's that. So, maybe we should leave it for another day. Now? No, got nothing to do... But I think we're done for today, no? I'm gonna fuck him anyway. What the hell. I'd rather fuck him than any other asshole from my school who doesn't know anything at all. That's what people go to college for. To meet new people. But with your "fuck the system", "I don't give a shit" pose, you can go fuck yourself. You slacker! That's it! Maybe. Hey, did I tell you my sister came home? Yeah? Which one? The one in Mexico? -Well, not anymore. Now she's home. -She's here. She came back out of nowhere, after two years. I found her sleeping on the couch. If you want I can change it. She's acting weird. I think she has something to do with Laura Bozzo's dissapearance. Your sister's quite a terrorist. -No, but really. -Really? Yeah. Her group was way into political stuff. What was that? Looks like someone's getting fucked. What do you need? Sneakers, jackets? A backpack? Well, don't worry, all the same I'll bring you a little present Are you sure you're alright? Yeah. I'm serious, yes. And now, really sad news for animal lovers. 35 dead cats were found in Kennedy Park. And in other bad news, a 26-year-old man stabbed his maid. We have Jonathan Castro via microwire. How does it feel to have killed your second mother? He's looking at you! Why did you do it? Tell us! The illusory walls will crumble and we will relish never before experienced liberty liberty to explore anything we have ever dreamed possible, in all directions. The sky is not the limit. The obscure agenda, in all its most fundamental philosophy, reduces itself to two points: One: To end with true spirituality and impose religion, as is already being done. Two: End with self-determination of the peoples, which is to say... It's so hot in your house. It's hot as shit. This is nothing compared to my other room. Where did you live? Next to the looney bin, Larco Herrera, on Inclan. A pair of crazy ladies lived next door. Holy shit. Gee! I would come back at one or two in the morning... and one of those old ladies would be standing at the far end of the landing in the twilight, under the threshold of her bedroom doorway. "Young man, have you seen a diaper with a maxi pad?" -That shit's gross! -Awful. -And had you seen it? -No! Did you find it? It's done. You want it? Fuck yes. Well, let's get a look at the trip. I have to treat it very carefully. Then we'll go to the huaca and have our ceremony. Woah, what are they? Penguins. Let's see, let me see! No, you might freak out. Your body absorbs all the Lysergic acid. Really fast, too. People have stuck it to their bodies to traffic it and have freaked out afterwards. Some have died. Its very volatile stuff, lysergic acid is. How long will it take to take effect on me? Half an hour. After three hours we'll reach the peak. It's summit. And after about four hours you'll be coming down. Look, I'll take a whole one... and you'll take half a penguin each. -Half? -Yeah, half. Otherwise you might freak out and have a horror trip. Like what? Communism and capitalism have fundamentally the same visage to them any Human race is the same. They are only interested in taking advantage of any conflict, created or instigated by them and to manipulate and control the human race. On your tongue and towards the back. Suck it like candy. Now, if you want to feel the taste... Can I chew it? No. Just suck it. Check this out! I wrote a conversation between the two crazy ladies on this paper. My two landladies, the witches, Vicky and Maruja. Vicky goes in her bedroom at eight in the morning. Lay here, take off your underwear. I'm not your chola. I've had it with you. I've had it! You'll be taken away somewhere. I'm just telling you now so you'll know now, you'll know. I don't want disgusting people in my house! Get the fuck out of my way! I need to take a bath! Goddamn it, come here. Turn around. You're a goddamn piece of shit, you cunt! Get the fuck off me! Piss on the floor, you smell like shit. You love shit don't you? You like it. Don't fucking touch me! Fucking sit! Fucking move! Sit! Can't you shit quicker? Goddamn it! You're used to living like a pig! Do it faster you piece of shit! Ok, stand! Stand quickly! Hold, stand! Ok, quick! Get out! Quickly! Hold on you dirty fucking piece of shit! By here they've already reached the other side of my door. Fucking walk! Let's go! You think I'm your chola? Goddamn it. Get down! Quick! They're going down the stairs. I've had it with this pest of yours. Fucking go down down, goddamn it! You eat so fucking well. It was like that every day, every morning. And what would she say? Who? The one that was being yelled at. She has the German. She has Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's, right. She can hardly even stand. She can't hold her shit in. She didn't answer back? No. Passion for high tech... ... makes them dream of a world controlled by artifacts... ... and superior on air, earth, and sea... ... without rivals or revolutions, except the ones created by Them... ... as part of their plans. And this, ladies, is the huaca. Woah. But what are the huacas, really? Like some kind of ruins? -Yeah. -They're all around Lima. They are ceremonial places. This was the centerpiece of about 15 others, I think. The center is where they held sacrifices. How come you know so much about it? Well, the guard over there is a friend of mine. -He's gonna let us in. -Great. How long has it been? Is it kicking in yet? It's been about half an hour. Give it 15 minutes more. What if it makes me freak out, Rosa? -Why would it? -Because of what we saw in the morning. The murder. Forget about it. Today we were hanging out by the boardwalk... and some lady got killed. And the murderer looked at me. Yeah, right. He kept staring at me! Well, she says he looked at her. Hey, you saw him looking at me. Yeah, yeah. I'll forget about it. If you have a bad trip what you need to do is shut off your inner monologue. Stop talking to yourself. Shut out every single thought. Just feel. Just feel. Don't talk to yourself. That's nice. It's hard to pull off, but it's the only thing you can do. Cool. It feels like we're somewhere completely different. Some strange energy. We're in the year 900. -You're about to be sacrificed. -Has it hit you guys yet? I'm good. I hope it hits me. Look... by the time we're up there. it'll hit you. Should I run up? If you want. Better yet. No. And that's where they've buried a lot of people. What else? Here, here, here. Is it like a cemetery? It's a cemetery and it's also a- We can see San Lorenzo island from here. That's San Lorenzo. Cool. Hey, it still hasn't hit me. What if it never hits me? What if I'm inmune? Has that ever happened? Someone who's unaffected. No. It'll hit you any second now. Wait, wait, wait. That's where the graves are. Let's go. There are some bones to be seen over there, the ground is treacherous, because you can't... TV has a manipulative power. The power of the image permits that all messages... ... connect directly to the subconscious. They modify the perception of reality via audiovisual elements. What are you gonna do? Offer something to Pachamama. Holy Pachamama!!! Hey, it's taking it away. Holy shit. It moved! This is really bad. How did it happen? Has it hit you? Has it hit you? It hasn't hit me yet. This is an awful sign. Has it hit you, Mike? I'm out of my mind already. That's why I don't like this at all. At all. Whats more, its gonna fly away any second now! What? What does it mean? The land of the dead is shaking, can't you see? No, no! Shut up, man. This is a terrible sign. Very bad sign. Damn. That's heavy shit. And you said it wouldn't hit you. It's done now. How are you guys doing? It's a good sign. Excellent. -I'm still good. -I'm good. It all came out in one pull. -You've thrown it all up. -Yeah. If you throw up on top of the graves, though... What are you talking about? The code is: C-R-H-Z-L-J. I'm here, I'm here. I was talking to Bird and... Dad said he would also be in charge of protection. Tell them about protection because some are not well informed Yeah, that's clear now. We shouldn't be so paranoid. We're good. you're carrying pesticide then, and vitamins, M takes the vitamins, I'm taking the pesticide. If you can stop by and... We will fumigate rats. Sit down. So, I don't know... if you like something I can take it? No, you can't take anything, but you can Why do you have so many tabloids? Because of the nudes? No, no, I'm not doing it because of the nudes. Oh yeah? Then why do you have a naked girl taped to your PC? No, that's something different. Not to confuse this part from this other part. This part is like this. Where I keep the important stuff. I keep everything that is... the source. Which basically is the... code to decode Everything. I mean, all of it. Oh, your prophecies. They are like... encrypted messages. You know? Let's call it like that. I'm just trying to search. And through the newspaper I can do it. I'm gonna show you later in detail how I do it. I get a newspaper like this one ...and then the magic happens. Yeah. Is there anything you want to know about anything? Oh, you can ask questions and all? Sure, sure. Let's do it. Have you got any? That's even better, right? To be more inspired. -You've got? -Sure. Awesome. And what's that? Believe it or not, I made it. I believe you. You definitely made it with your grandma's stuff. Well, but I've got Internet, which is the important thing anyway. Hey, and you always meet girls online? -And you bring them here? -Damn.. the normal amount. No, no no, I don't bring them here. Who has been the youngest? You, I guess. Hooray! Well, anyway. Don't think that I'm always doing this. I've done it like twice. But it's all right, you're special. This is it. Have you seen the coca rituals? When they use it to try to see beyond? I've heard about it, but no... Ok, look. You have to blow it when I put this in front of you. Go. So little? Just go. Don't be afraid. You have to blow stronger! HAS MY INTIMACY EVER EXISTED? That's it. Why did that show up? It's the answer you're not willing to see. This seems like a little too specific. Hey, no, no. Chill out. Wait a little. If something else comes up I'll believe you. Something, I don't know, more important. What if instead we just keep on drinking and smoking and... -More rum? -...I don't know, get a little more comfortable. Want me to bring it over? Yeah, bring the rum over. Everything alright? Good, good. Well, give it a sip. So good you're here. I missed you. But we don't know each other yet. Yeah. I know we don't know each other yet. There's some things you still don't know about me. There's some things you still don't know about me. Hey. I think I've seen you put on those glasses before. These? Nah, I've never worn them before. This is the first time. I think I've been in your room. I'm having one of those deja vu moments. Oh, when you think you've lived something before and then it happens again? Yeah, and the feeling is still going on. But it doesn't matter. The thing is, listen to me, I wanted to tell you why I'm wearing these glasses. Why? Remember once we were chatting... and I told you about my fantasy? That I wanted to film myself doing it with you? Yeah? Ok, so these glasses are a camera. Yeah, right. No, really. It's a gadget. Totally. It can even record audio. Your moaning will sound divine. -Oh really? -Yeah. Ok, so what do you want to do right now? Now we're going to play. I'll be the director. And you'll be my porn actress. You in? It'll be a total success. Let's start with foreplay. Maybe you can move a little bit. Sexy, you know. -I don't know. I'm not sure. -We have to do this right. We have to do this right. Don't you think? Don't be shy. People like you. The camera likes you. The camera is in love with you. Maybe start taking off your clothes. Take of your shirt. Very good, very good. Just like that. This is perfect. It's gonna be a total success. You're so cute. So young and tender. I think... you could take this too. Very good, just like that. Great, yeah. A little more. That's it. Perfect. You know all the moves. Can you touch yourself? Play with them? Shit, what do we have here? Wow. Suddenly, an unexpected turn. We've got Rudolph and the gang. Or whatever that deer's name is. This is so cute. You're a little girl. How old are you? You know. I do. We better leave it there. This is really perfect. Very good. Now, turn around. Ok, but you too, right? Me too, you say? Tell me something dirty. Come on. Say something. I want to hear you. The camera wants to hear you. Everyone wants to hear you. The whole world is watching this. Wow. You've got so many bruises too. This gives me some many ideas. Ideas for what? Ok, I'm gonna stop here. Is that ok? Hey, these glasses do have a USB port. Of course. It's a sophisticated piece of equipment. It's what the pros use. So you did tape something. And very well. Young man, your grandmother is waiting to have supper with you. Fuck! Who is this girl fucking? This bitch is so hot. She's fucked. How come I didn't cum right there? Fuck. Ok! Yo it's so easy to shoot a porno. Dude. Junior, how have you been? I brought you the promised land!

How long have you been doing it? I thought you were nothing but a jerk-off. I thought I'd made you a sicko forever, that you would never get your hands on a girl. When I promise something, I come through with it. That's the thing. What kind of drug did you use to bait her, fucker? Let's put this on. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. That's the thing. But look at it. This is really gonna take you to a great spot in the niche market. I mean, don't give it to anybody else is all I'm saying. Thing is, most girls in Peruvian porn are butt ugly. Let's see if yours gives us a surprise. This chick is really hot. She's a shaven little girl. Very tight. That's all you need to know. VIDEOFILIA presents Videophilia... What? Hey, hold on. I think your machine is fucked. No, no. I was watching a video a minute ago. But I tried it on my computer and it wasn't this pixelated. No, bro. You have the master and you made a bad copy. No, no way I made it like this. I saw it already... and even jerked off to it and it wasn't like this. You made a bad copy, man. Look, it's all pixelated. It's probably an old DVD or some shit like that. Now look. Godammit. Fuck. Ok, well. We'll do this: I'll go to my house and fix it, alright? The girl looks hot, yeah. Look at this shit. Don't you wanna put your finger in it? Ok, so this is what we'll do. This shit is pixelated. I don't know what happened. But I'm gonna fix it, ok? I want to see the original copy because this is really interesting, all fucked up. -Ok. -But we need the real thing so we can sell it. Look, I'll tell you what. Have you realized it's all changing? Everything. Reality. I swear I haven't been feeling like I'm part of reality anymore. Everything is changing, dude. There isn't a reality or a virtual reality anymore, bro.
