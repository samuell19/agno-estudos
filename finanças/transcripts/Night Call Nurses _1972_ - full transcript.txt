(wind blowing) (nurse calls page over speaker) - Cynthia. (footsteps) (footsteps) (footsteps) (footsteps) (footsteps) (wind blowing) Cynthia. (screams) (upbeat rock music) There's gonna be a lot more Cynthia's, you know. - I know, it's just, if I'd only stayed with her. - If you'd only, what, stayed with her around the clock? What about the other patients in suicide? - I don't know. - It's not your fault. - Guess not. - You know, Barbara, I think we should let Sandy blame herself for every patient that can't be reached. - Yeah, I think you're right, Janice. - Yeah, that way I figure it will take her about three months to go completely bananas. - Right, and then she'd still be with us. - But as a patient. (string bass music) I thought the prison riots were over. - [Voiceover] Dr. Becky Smith, please report to the sixth floor. - Excuse me, nurse Mayall. Who's the latest victim of the police in the ward? - Do we really need quite so large a delegation to get through the day's hospital gossip? - Why no, nurse, we just, and wondered. - It's John Sampson, suicide attempt. It needn't concern your prison ward case. - John Sampson, of the prison riots. - Ooo, my, aren't we well informed. Now, don't you girls come out with any special edition. The last thing we need here are clamoring reporters and picket lines. - Don't worry, Miss Mayall, we'll button up. - Have you girls really nothing to do? - [Voiceover] Paging Dr. Frank Dory. - Yes, yes of course. Now then, young man, your name please. Last name first, first name, middle name last. - It was like that night in Tulsa. There was nothing else I could do. I had to make the contract. I know I did. - I beg your pardon? Your name, please. Could we have your name? (clears throat) Toby, Kyle, is that right? No middle name. - Oh, I don't care. I care blow arrow feather, no I can't. What the hell, what's one more trip for Chrissake? I gotta pay six bills a month. - Young man, you're not being very cooperative. Now, you can't be admitted until I get this information. I have to fill out a 1034 and pink slip you. Otherwise you'll sit there all day. Oh, nurse, can you take care of this patient, please. 1034, a pink slip, it's visual and auditory hallucination. I think it's one of those LSD cases. - Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, why do I get all the nuts? - What do you see? - Between my mirrors, I see everything behind me. - What's behind you? - The truck, the rig, the lights, the little trucks moving in and out of the traffic on the road, and everyone's going so fast, and, my God, I've gotta shift down. I can't shift down, now what's the matter? I can't shift down. (upbeat rock music) (buzzing) - Kyle, do you know where your truck is? - My truck. I left her, I gotta get back to her. - Kyle, your rig's alright, you left it on the highway. It's in the garage. Kyle, what are you on? - I'm on a combo of laughers, criers and side-winders. - Set it here, friend. - Where's he taking me? - To that big truck stop in the sky. Come on. - Now, you mind the double clutches, boy. - Thus, your position with this organization is hereby terminated. I failed to become aware of the invisible negligence with which you've been conducting the company's business sooner, only because of my extensive facial disfigurement, and subsequent major surgery made necessary by a pyro-maniacal employee almost as incompetent as yourself. Furthermore, I did not send for you. - I know, I brought you some fresh flowers. - This is a private room, not a conversation. You're welcome to bring the flowers to my funeral, but until that day, I will not be disturbed by you or anyone. - Just thought you could use some cheer. Maybe a little bit of light. (blinds click) - Dammit, girl, close that. - Most people enjoy sunlight. Makes them feel alive. - I am not most people. I am Miles Charles Bailey, the largest single patron of this hospital. And if you value your dubious position here, you'll see to it that you don't enter this room again. (tray clinks) - Good day, Mr. Bailey. Sorry. - These young nurses can be very trying at times. I'm forced to live with it, but you'll be leaving us soon, won't you? (plates click) - To escape from your suffocating, maternal embrace, madam, is the sole incentive for my existence. Please, remove this. You may give it to a deserving psychopath. - Shouldn't those bandages have come off about a week ago? - When you complete your psychiatric nurses training, you can formulate policy. I'm sorry to be so stern with you, Barbara. - That's okay. - But you do disappoint me. The way you slink about in a uniform two sizes too small, and no name tag? One would expect you to be in there, wiggling your little ass for some of that nine million dollars. - [Sandy] Isn't that wild? It was just sitting in my hospital mailbox. - Now, why haven't gotten one of those? I always heard blondes had more fun. - [Voiceover] Dear Sandra, I've watched you at work and at play. I've seen the way you've flaunted your body. You will be made to suffer for it. If you are ever without your friends, I will hack you. - Sounds like a barrel of laughs, doesn't he? Uh-oh, Bathrobe Benny's at it again. - Good afternoon, ladies. I'm so glad to see you looking so chipper and bright on such an exquisite day. - You seem cheerful as always this morning, Benny. - Well, you know, the sight of such a charming girl always gives a lift to an old man's spirit. - Now, why did you have to go and do that? We were having such a nice conversation. Imagine, a man of your age. - Young lady, age has nothing to do with it. I've been doing it all my life. A bit late to change my ways, wouldn't you agree? - I think it's time we went back to your room. Fine, fine. - [Voiceover] Paging Dr. Mary Louise Cole, Dr. Paul Ceras. - Au revoir, my jet-age Florence Nightengales. Or, should I say, goodbye? - Hey, he seems like really a sweet guy. It's just a speed freakout. Anyway, I think he's gonna be alright. - I hope so. - What is this? Hard-hearted Hannah is softening up? - Is this the same girl who keeps giving us lectures about, don't get too involved with the patients? - Oh, enough shop talk, girls, I've gotta be back in two hours. - Night call? - Not me, I've got a free 24 hours. I think me and my favorite grad student are gonna go sky diving. - Hey, that sounds like a gas. - You bet. - [Voiceover] Police will reveal neither the location of the hospital where Sampson is not being treated, or any details of how he sustained the injuries. On the Asian front, American B-52's bombed (click) (engine roaring) (bright rock music) - [Barbara] God, it's good to get away from that hospital. I feel almost normal again. - [Man] Dr. Brammell is gonna be really disappointed to hear that. - Hey, layoff. You know, I'm sure there's not another patient in suicide who's exhibited a stronger death wish than us jumping of that goddamned plane. Anyway, their really not that different. - Well, if that's the case, then why don't you get us a bed in your ward? I mean, when I'm away from you, I experience all kinds of symptoms. Like depression and acute anxiety. (chuckles) - Oh, shut up. I love you with all your symptoms. (soft music) (giggling) How can you be so speedy at that? You've always been that way, you know that? (slow jazz music) - [Voiceover] Hey you, hold it there. - Hello, Mr. Assistant Warden Kelly, how are you doing? How's Trix? - What are you doing up here, boy? - Now, Mr. Assistant Warden, sir. I'm a free man, a responsible citizen. So don't you come to me with that shit. - Now, Mr. Jude, you've been reading that constitution again. - Yeah. - Listen, punk. I wanna know what you're doing here. Or I'll run you in for exposing your black ass in public. - Well, I just came down here, sir, to find out about them free chest x-rays the government provides for us members of them underprivileged minorities. But they only give 'em on Mondays and Thursdays and Fridays. Get your hands off of me. - Don't you ever let me catch you around here again. - No, sir. You won't catch me around here no' mo'. - You're really handling that paperwork, ain't you? - I'm sorry. Can I help you sir? - I dunno, maybe you can, I don't even know how to go about this, you know. - Well, maybe I do. Yeah, I'm looking for a friend of mine. I know he got hurt but I don't know where they took him, you know, I must have been to a dozen hospitals. - I see, well perhaps I can help you. What's your friend's name? - John Sampson. - No, I don't see your friends name here. - Yeah, well, look, I'm worried about him, you know, because they're trying to kill him. - Well, I'm sure he'll be quite safe in the hospital. - You know, they said that he tried to kill himself, but I'm gonna tell you something: if John got his hands on a piece, you know the first dude he'd blow away would be that warden, ma'am. - I don't know why you're telling me all this. - This is suicide prevention, and you are a volunteer in suicide prevention, now you go in there and see if the man is alright, that's your job. - No, that is not my job. - Now, damn it, lady, look, that cheap Kelly won't even let the man's lawyer know where he is. - Look, I'm not an errand girl for you or anyone else. Besides, I told you, he's not here. - Oh, come on, sister, how long you gonna keep up that bullshit? - I told you, I never heard of him. - John Sampson and the San Ansano prison riots. - I - Yeah, uh-huh. Now look. John is a friend of mine, alright? And he's very important to a whole lot of people. Black people, me and you, and he's working from inside that prison trying to get us together. You hear me? Now, all I want you to do, baby, is to go in there and say one thing to the man, that's all, just one thing. Jude is working on the twister. - What? - Don't worry about what it means, John will know. What's your name, baby. - Sandra. - Hey, well look, Sandra. Got to do what I've got to do, you know? - You sure handled it with a great deal of finesse. - Yeah, well let me tell you something about finesse, baby. It don't mean a thing in this land of mine. - Leave your number. I'll call you if I hear anything. - Whatever's fair. (soft keyboard music) - And when they found the truck, the engine was still running. Six months of sweet-talking, and I go and leave their trailer full of gun sights sitting in an alley. - Ever happen before? - No, I was a virgin. But I guess that's one of the hazards of being a knight of the road. - A drugstore truck driving man. - Hey, without my magic vitamins, I wouldn't have any rig at all. I mean, at least they keep me working, ya know. You know what my monthly payments are on that thing? Six bills. - You don't seem like a man who worries about money. - Yeah, well I better start worrying, because you know what they just hit me with for my little stay here? $566, now you know what you get for that? You get to sit in a wheelchair, and you get a bathrobe, and somebody sticks a thermometer in you. $566, Lord, I can get a brain transplant for that. - But you're a new man. - Yeah, why don't you take a pound of flesh instead? - You're walking out of here clean. - Well, I don't know. You're not gonna give me a speech on the ills drugging now, are you? - Nope, you know a lot more about that than I do. - So, they're finally letting you loose, huh? - Well, how you doing, Kit? - Pretty good, hey now, you keep your eye on those gun sights, huh? - Well, I'll do that if you keep your eye on the pretty nurses. - I will. Take it easy, cowboy. - You know, there sure are some nice people around here. Janice. Is that your name or the name of your left titty? - That's my name. The name of my left titty is Irene. - Dr. Rollins, it seems like we're running low on barbiturates. - Good heavens. You don't supposed somebody's taken them? Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Now let's see, what was that? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Was that 3,000 bithetemins or 2,000 tritheimins? (chuckles) Oh dear, oh dear, I hate inventory. You know, all those pills, they give me a headache. - Would you like an aspirin? - Oh, yes, thank you. Oh, we forgot to order them. - E. Eddie Edwards is here. Edwards is the name, by golly doctor, medication is the game. - Just a moment, young man. We are very busy here, this is a restricted area. What is your business? - Doctor, let me just take a moment of your time. The wonderful folks at the terminal pharmaceutical came to me when I was working the street this set. That's your chopper, you slice, slice, slice away. Your orange juice, and by golly, the spiral, Mike, you get that one free. And they came to me and said "Eddie, do for us what you're "doing for the wonderful folks at Chop-Chop-Chopomatic." They said, "Take the medication. "Go out to your various institutions. "Wait a minute, go directly to your clinics. "Go to your hospitals, state-governed "federal hospitals, go either way. "Go to your firehouse if necessary." - No, no, no, no, just a moment. You see, we order all of our pharmaceutical supplies from he best houses, the most reliable firms. - Well, doctor, just give me a minute of your time. Here, let me show you about some of the fine medication, the finest medication developed by the mind and hand of man. I have it right here in my suitcase. Here. Wait a minute, wait a minute, doc. Suppose a woman comes to your office, identifies herself as the victim in a traveling whip act, complains of having red stripes all over her body. I recommend to you that you prescribe Rectal. - I'm sorry, sir, but we don't use Rectal anymore. You see, it promotes Parkansanism. Shame, shame on you, doctor. We know it promotes Parkansanism, we make that fine product. But when the Parkansanism develops, here's what you recommend to counteract that, Tyrol. - My dear Mr. Edwards, in hospital procedure in these matters, you must submit an IRT and an SL case history break down before I can even listen to one word you say. - Well, doctor, I think if you'll check your files, you'll find out that the wonderful people back there in terminal have got an okay on an FUC. Now, check that out, but let me tell ya. - Would it be unpatriotic to ask Mr. Edwards to leave? There is work that needs to be done. - Oh, yes, yes. - Young lady, you've been bugging me ever since I walked into the office, by golly, you're making it difficult, I think you've poisoned the doctors mind against me. Now, you in some way think that these wonderful manufacturers of drugs are not doing good? - As far as I'm concerned, you can take your pills back to your company. Already, half the nation is so boggled up with your wonder drugs that they don't know if they're coming or going. And I understand that drug companies spend nearly a billion dollars a year promoting drugs. - Not promoting, advertising. Now, we like to think of ourselves as simply filling the nation's prescription, filling a need as it were. - Or creating one. - Young lady, look, I'm going to tell you it's people like you who are destroying this country. Instead of directing your anger towards the big drug companies, why don't you go out and get those junkies who are peddling pot in the streets? I know your type, you march around in parades peace here, peace here. You people keep it up, there won't even be any wars anymore. You know, it's the doctor and I, we were happy, we almost went in World War II, and that's what makes this country great. - You sensitive about national or worldly matters? - Yes, I am. - Let me prescribe something to you. Relax with Librio. - I needed that. (electric guitar) (buzz) (door opens) - What can I do for you? - I worked in the hospital's suicide prevention clinic. I understand one of the patients from the prison ward attempted suicide. - Yeah, that's right. Unsuccessfully, unfortunately. - I thought it might be helpful if I were allowed to speak to him. - No deal, sister, no visitors. If he needed help, I'd call his friend, the governor. They talk on the phone, you know. Oh, he's a big man. - That's not quite the point. You see, if you're unfamiliar with our work, - Look, I'm just telling you this for your own good, and for your own safety. Leave his types to types like me. - Well, perhaps if he weren't always surrounded by types like you. - Nursey, I've had it with you. You don't get in to see him. Nobody's gonna get in to see him. And the next time you wanna try and find him, you better try the morgue. - Mayall said the next time she wore her afro to work, she'd get it. (chuckling) - [Standing Woman] I would like. - Where's Kit, Chloe? - I would like to have some java with you. - You must never leave without telling me, Chloe. - I was cold. Hot, the way I like it. - Turn me loose. (yelling) (grunting) (laughter) - It's just a game, Chloe. - Don't you see there's a patient in here? - Can't you do anything but make a complete ass out of yourself? - Yeah, lady. There's plenty I can do. - Come on, Burt. - Yeah. - Now it getting so you need a program to tell the nuts from the nurses around here. - Chloe, come on, let's go back to the room. Come on. (country music) (engine roars) - [Kyle] Say, what's new at the psycho ward? - [Janice] The usual, two patients checked in, six patients checked out, and we found out the man we've been for two weeks as a catatonic was actually a deaf mute. - [Kyle] Jesus, none of that tied-down, uptight life for me, mm mm. - [Janice] Oh yeah, you've got it real good. - [Kyle] Well, at least I'm working for me. - [Janice] You're not, you're working for the finance company. By the time you get that classy chassis of yours paid off, you're gonna need a new one. - [Kyle] You know, you've got a pretty classy chassis yourself girl? - [Janice] Oh, be quiet, you can't even afford the headlights. - [Kyle] Well, someday, I'm gonna get me a savings account, you know, and then I'm gonna get - [Janice] Saving up to buy your own truck company. - [Kyle] Hell, I'm saving up to buy my own highway. Ain't you never been out with a shit-kicker before? - [Janice] I've kicked my share. (honky-tonk piano music) - [Kyle] Don't you have any fun around here in LA? - [Janice] No, I do what you do. - [Kyle] Now, what's that? - [Janice] I get the hell out of this city, go to the mountains or the desert. - [Kyle] Oh, a little hippie girl, huh? - [Janice} Now that's a sweet, nostalgic expression. - [Kyle] Well, back home, folks call me hippie. - [Janice] Jesus, I wonder if he followed us here. - [Kyle] What? - [Janice] Burt, that creepy orderly on the ward. - Well, he better quit messing with my rig, or I'm make him a creepy patient. Hey, what's the matter, you sick or something, boy? (crickets chirping) - [Janice] Burt, what are you doing here? - Hello, you little cute-ass bitch. Man, you sure look good out of that nurses uniform. How'd you like to take a ride after you've finished with your cowboy here? - Oh, come on, let's go he's drunk. - Hey, where'd you learn your etiquette, boy, in the dirty bookstore or something? (can clangs) - Come on. - Big man? Don't do that? (engine roars) - [Kyle] Now, you just stay right over there. And don't move! (wind blows) You looking for trouble? - What's the hassle, Burt. - He's really coming down heavy on me, man. - This guy here, huh? - Yeah. - Alright, let's go baby. - Here we go. You don't move now, you hear me? (scuffling) (honky-tonk music) - [Janice] Do you always play like this? - [Kyle] Only when necessary. Bored. - [Janice] Or drunk, or speeding. - [Kyle] Or defending lovely little ladies like yourself. (soft country music) (heavy breathing) (hearts beating) (dissonant music) (rhythmic nonsense sounds) (dogs barking) - Games. That's the broad title I give to this afternoon's activities in the third meeting of our encounter session. We begin with the human machine. By grouping together and combining our various rhythms into a single rhythm, we can establish an understanding of the essential unity of the group. A single, organic entity. Communicating through a basic language whose vocabulary is movement, expression, action and feeling. Through this physical exchange, and through our later verbal encounter, we hope to strip away the layers of defense mechanisms we have built up since childhood, and come to a greater understanding of who and why we are. Now, you've all had time to read the results of the personality test. And I'm happy to report that you're all normal. - [Student] Why the microphone, Doctor? - We I prefer to record our discussions rather than take notes, because it allows me more freedom to participate. Barbara, would you take these and put them on the study desk? If any of you have any qualms about the tape recorder, I'll be glad to turn it off. But I want to assure you, each of you, that everything said and done here is in strict confidence. (footsteps) Barbara's test results were surprisingly low. They showed extremely strong, but still latent, deviant behavior patterns. I thought it'd be best to substitute less damaging results when I returned her paper, but it's something we really can't afford to ignore. I know this must be a shock, especially to you, Zack, in light of her outward, normal behavior, but we must all remember how thin the line is between what we, much too glibly I think, classify as normal and deviant. In any case, after a lot of thought, I decided it would be a more positive step for Barbara to alter the results so she can remain with us without feeling a freak, than to give her the real results and send her on her way. She'll be back any second, so just keep it in mind now. And don't get too heavy on her during the sessions. Okay? (footsteps) Okay, boys and girls, when you take the hat, it's like taking the hot seat. Now, no one will force you to take it. But you must remember this is a group, and everyone must participate. Jesus, I sound like a sixth grade school marm. The purpose of our new toy, its just something to bounce off of. Who wants to be the first guinea pig? - I'll do it, I ain't scared. - Okay. Fearless George. What do you see? - It's a war action scene. - Well, that doesn't mean anything. What do you see in it? - Some sort of adventure. Survival of the fittest. - Oh, bullshit, what are you, some kind of a Nazi? And what the hell do you see in heroic in someone being blown to pieces? - That's something only men can understand, and women can't. (groans) - Peace, beauty, honesty. Honesty and acceptance of one's body. - Oh wow, what phony bullshit. - It's not bullshit, goddammit. - Who do you think you're kidding? - I mean, it takes the site of a burning peasant to get you off, that doesn't mean that other people can't enjoy a beautiful and sexual relationship. And can't dig their own bodies. - Well, if you're so accepting of your body, what don't you get right there and do a strip for us, right now, instead of talking about it? - I don't have to prove anything to you. - Melissa, it's clear you believe strongly in what you're saying, and that you believe what you're saying is true, but think of this. Your reaction to George's suggestion is basically identical with that of an unliberated woman. Let's find out what taboo caused you to dismiss it out of hand. - There's no taboo, I'm perfectly willing to strip. (fire crackling) (jazzy music) - This is about as honest as I can get. - Well, that's just as honest as keep taking them all off. - Well, the only reason I hesitate is because I'm afraid I might like it too much. You know like, really, I think I would sort of get off on exposing myself to someone, it sort of scares me. - Exhibitionism is just another part of everyone's sexuality, there's no reason it should be more frightening than any other part. - Well, okay, maybe we can solve the problem right now, right, doc? - If you say so Robin. (jazzy music) - Barbara, you don't seem to be a part of the group tonight. Something wrong? - No. - You're sure? - Yes. - [Bramwell] Don't you approve of what's going on here? - Yes, I approve, I just. - Just what, Barbara? - I just don't feel like talking, that's all. - Cop out. - Shut up. - I think we all have a right to hear that, Barbara. - I said shut up. - Oh wow, hostility. - What is it, Barbara? You weren't like that this afternoon. Is it talking about sex? - No. - Something to do with your feelings about your own body? - I didn't ask for the hat. - You're a nice looking girl, Barbara. You have a nice body. - I said I didn't want the hat. - Hey, take it easy. - No one's going to force you to take off your clothes, Barbara. - I know. - What's that, Barbara, I couldn't hear that. - I said I know! Stop treating me like a four year old. - Who's treating you like a four year old? - You are, everybody. - Paranoid. - Look, I heard what you said when I left the group. - What who said about you? - You, and you all. - We didn't say anything about you, Barbara. (laughter) - What are you trying to do to me? - [Zack] Nothing. - Look, just stay away from me. - [Zack] Barbara. - Don't you touch me. Look, I've had it with all of this. You people can just go and play with somebody else from now on. (door shuts) - I think I'd leave her alone for a little while if I were you, Zack. She won't go far. Give her a little time to calm down. She's a, basically, very stable girl. (birds chirping) (upbeat music) - I don't know how smart it is for a young lady to be out hitchhiking alone at night. You hear all kinds of hair-raising stories. You do this kind of thing often? - Pardon? - I mean, it's not safe. (clears throat) That's a great sound on that thing, huh? I got a good deal on it. If you don't like that selection, there's a whole bunch more in the glove compartment, I mean, you can have anything you choose. - No, it's fine, really, it's fine. - Well, I like to keep up with the latest sounds and all, I mean, you know. - [Bramwell] It would be best to mention it without her being present. Barbara's test results were surprisingly low. - [Man] You going any place in particular? - [Bramwell] Still latent, deviant behavior. (smacks console) - What are you doing, don't, you're gonna bust that thing. - I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - That's a nice piece of machinery there, you don't mess around with a thing like that. You don't like the music, I got others in there. You want me to put another in there, you don't want that? Well, I was just driving around, you know, and I thought, well, you're a real nice girl. Wanna go for a drink or something? - Why don't you just let me off right here. - Well, we ain't gone any place yet, I mean, tell me where you wanna go, I can drop you off there. - This is fine, just let me... - [Man] What? - Just let me off here. - [Man] Hey, well, listen, what's your name, what's your phone number? - Could you just let me out, please? Just let me out. - [Man] What, did I say something wrong? - No, really, its fine, just let me out. - Just thought you were a nice looking girl. - Just please let me out! - Don't get so hyped. - [Bramwell] We must all remember how thin the line is between what we, much too glibly, (car honks) (people humming) classify as normal. (phone rings) - [Voiceover] Paging, paging doctor, paging nurse. - [Bramwell] I know this must be a shock, especially to you, Zack. (laughter) And as median. (cacophony of sound) - Barbara was laid up with a fever last night. - I've love to meet him. - Sandy. Hey, Sandy, look. Look what I've got. "Dear Janice, if only you had been alone "in the back of that truck. "Did you see me that night? "I don't think so. "You are very evil, but soon you'll be punished. "It won't be long now." Have you heard from Barbara? - No, I've been calling all morning. Zack called, his car is missing. He thinks maybe Barbara borrowed it. (birds chirping) (engine roars) (brakes screeching) (car accelerates) (car screeching) (car screeching) (car accelerates) (car screeches) (sobbing) (door shuts) - What really happened last night? You can talk to me, you know. - I heard you. When I was in the study. I heard what you told them. - [Bramwell] What did I tell them? What did you hear? - That I was a deviant. And that you changed me down to the test before you gave 'em to me. (sobbing) - [Bramwell] Why didn't you say something when you came back into the room? - I don't know. I guess I was just too upset. But I said it later, and you all denied it. You were all playing with me. - [Bramwell] No, we weren't We argued it because nothing happened. Haven't you talked to Zack? - No. - [Bramwell] You should, he's worried half out of his mind. He'd never lie to you. Neither will I. You believe that, don't you? - I think so. - Well, that's a start. Listen, why there's something made you hear what you think you heard. We've got to find out what. Were you that anxious about the results of those tests? - No. Well, not consciously. - Was it the sex bit? Have you had trouble with sex lately? - No. - [Bramwell] Now, be honest with yourself. - I don't know. Of course, I don't have anything to compare it to. - Will you let me help you? Will you give me a call? - I don't know. Yes. - Good. Believe me, it will work out. I think you should go on home now. (soft piano music) - I know there's an elevator that services supplies to the prison ward. It would get you behind those locked doors. - Great. But won't that elevator be locked? - Maybe, but Mayall will have the keys at her desk. - Hey, Janice, do you know if there've been any medication changes for the patients in 112? - I don't know, Kit. I think it's been increased, but I'll have to check it to make sure. (murmuring) (screaming) - [Benny] Ladies, please, try to calm yourselves. There's no need for all this hysteria. - Guess I'll have to go rescue old Benny. (laughter) (elevator stops) (electric guitar) - John, Jude Beal. - What do you know about Jude Beal? - [Sandy] He sent me to see you. - Is that right? - He said to tell you he's working on the twister. - What? - The twister. - Where's the hacksaw? Yeah. They talked about the twister on the inside. The key, you know. The key to get out. The key to free yourself. Not running from jail, but to really free yourself. How is he? - Fine, he's just worried about how you are. - Alive. That's a lot for me. - They say you tried to kill yourself. - Ain't no way, mama. I was sleeping, the shot woke me up. - How could they ever think they'd get away with a thing like that? - Typical prison logic. I suppose they thought people would see it as a confession if I killed myself. They probably would. In my 34 years, I've been shot, cut, beaten, and gassed. I don't know what they'll try next. But I tell you, I'm finding it damn hard to get insurance. - Well, they can't kill you here. - Hm. Do you know that more people die in hospitals than anywhere? But you know, I can't lose. I got news for 'em. If I get out and live, I'll keep on working. Trying to change things. If they kill me, then I'm a martyr. And other people will do the work. It's my name helping. (footsteps) Hey. Tell my man not to wind up dying in the bed next to me. - John is a persuasive cat. You know, when the riots went down in prison, we was the guards and the pigs was the hostages, man. (chuckles) For just a little while, man, we was equal, us and the pigs. Then he came down. I remember John, though, he was talking to this one pig named McNally, you dig? He was telling the cat, like, how he was a prisoner too, you know? But he didn't know it. But McNally could dig where he was coming from, you know, I mean, he really understood what my man was trying to say. - I'll do everything I can to help, Jude. You know that. - I know you will, baby. (kiss) Hey, you know what? I can get a plane for the cat, man. We can get him out of the country, but the first thing we got to do is get him away from Kelly. And you in that hospital alone, you ain't gonna be much of an army. - Well, maybe I can get someone else to help us. Someone on the inside. - They white? - Seems to me we've got to take help where we can find it. - Hey. How long do you wanna do them dishes, huh? You been there a half hour already. - You wanna do them? - I spent four years in the slammers, busting suds, and I'm gonna tell you something right now, you want me to do them dishes, but I ain't doing them, not this year, baby. - Mmhmm, you've paid your dues, huh? - Dig it. (chuckles) (slow rock music) - [Kyle] Why, I never sleep. Afraid I'll wake up in the same place. - Don't you know how to relax? - I tried it once, but, you know, it doesn't get me anywhere. You know, I got a whole country to patrol, keep the wheels of commerce churning, and all that, so. - You're an incredible compulsive. - You think I'm compulsive? Why you should have met old Joe Dante. Now, he was compulsive. You know, he wanted to be world famous at something, anything. So he started out to walk across Asia, backwards. When he got to India, they hailed him as a prophet. And he got to Thailand, and the native girls, they strew flowers in his path. And he got to Kashmir, and they thought he was a prince, and they gave him a castle, but you think that stopped Old Joe? Mm mm, he kept right on moving. - So, what happened then? - The Mongolians executed him as a blasphemer. Seems like they had some regulation against walking backwards on a holy day. - So? - Well, so now, you can see him down at Riley's was museum. He's famous. - Great, so is that what you wanna do? - Well, no, I hate museums, and I hate Asians. - Come on, let's go to bed. At least you can't talk while you're kissing. - Now, wait a minute, once, for six days, I chattered constantly while simultaneously - [Janice] Oh, would you cool it? - [Kyle] I got up on that bed, and I spun up and down. You know, that's the trouble with you, you just don't know how to relax. Now, what you ought to do is settle down. - [Janice] Boy, you need a shower. - [Kyle] You know, I think you got some kind of a water fetish or something. (laughter) - [Janice] Come on. (laughter) (country music) (screams) (laughter) - [Kyle] Tall woman. (laughter) (lighter clicks) (sighs) - I just keep thinking. - Of what? - I dunno, just things. I just keep thinking that I shouldn't be thinking. I should just be, like you said. - That's right. - But if I'm thinking that I should just be, then I'm not being. I am so mixed up. - You're just a little self-conscious, that's all. No big deal. - Maybe if we went someplace else. Someplace where I felt more comfortable. More at home. - Like your home, for example? - Yeah. Like my home. - Alright, whenever you're ready, no need to push it. (suspenseful music) (jazzy music) - [Sandy] Did you get the plane? - [Jude] Yeah, a single engine piper, flown by a mercenary, a cat that used to run guns at Shawn Bay, you know? Dude will do anything for some coin. (clapping and yelling) (children yelling) - [Sandy] Where will we meet him? - [Jude] A small airport. We'll have to switch cars and move like our asses are on fire before the line goes out. - [Sandy] Can we do it? - [Jude] If your people come through. - [Sandy] They will, I'm just scared, that's all. - [Jude] Who ain't? - [Janice] I just don't know, Sandy. I mean, what you're asking me to do, it's pretty heavy. - [Sandy] I didn't say it wasn't, did I? - [Janice] I know. But John Sampson, I mean, this whole thing, it's just not part of my life. - [Sandy] Well, what is? - What is what? - What is a part of your life? - I don't know. Being a good nurse, I guess. Being with Kyle, for now, anyway. Living with you and Barbara, I don't know, Sandy, that's a dumb question. - Okay, okay, then why did you become a nurse? - Same reason that you did. - And what was that? - To marry a beautiful, rich, doctor. (chuckles) - And you got you a speed freak, and I got me an ex-con. Oh, wow. - Yeah, we're really doing great. - You know, I remember when I decided to become a nurse. I made this great, big, wonderful speech to my mother about wanting to help people. - Saving lives. - That's all I'm asking you to do, Janice. Help us save a life. - Hey, I just don't know if it's the same thing. - Sure it is. A man is about to get a bullet in him, right? Well, should we wait until he's shot and half dead before we try and save him? Or should we try and save him now, before the bullet is fired? - You sound like you've been taking lessons from Jude. - He's right. - I know. Mail call, a letter from home. - Dear Barbara, I've watched you play with both your lovers. - Will they be there to protect you? - Soon, you'll pay for all your sins. Yeah, this isn't a joke. Someday, this mental case is gonna get tired of writing poems. And then what? - One more nut in your life shouldn't be such a burden. - Yeah, but it's not just one more. I've been studying the symptoms for so long, I see them in everybody, even myself. You know, at times, when I leave here at night, I feel like I'm sneaking out. (phone rings) - You'll get over it. - Yeah, but why is everybody so crazy? - Excuse me, ladies, I seem to have misplaced my marbles, have you seen them? - See what I mean? - Ah, luscious lavender, is it not? I don't believe I have that tempting shade. - Benny, are you the lipstick maniac? - Maniac? My dear, young lady, I may be a madman, but a maniac, never. - You haven't been writing us these notes? - Why should I? I have my own instrument of communication. (eerie music) - Whatever happens, that's what's gonna be. I know I'm not frightened of it anymore. At least not with your help. - Are you sure about what we're doing? We're not pushing it? - No, I'm sure I want it. I want you. (rock music) (dress unzips) (moaning) (feet clomping) (sighs) (ice cubes rattle) - Barbara, there's something I have to tell you. - Go on. - [Bramwell] I don't quite know how to say it. - I think I know what you're gonna tell me. - No, I don't think you do. - That you've become involved with a certain patient. - Barbara. - Who you've helped, and who really is very grateful to you. - No, that's enough of that now. - Why? - We expect a certain affection and dependence to develop between a patient and a doctor, you know that Barbara. - What do you mean? - But to confuse romance with a professional relationship is extremely dangerous. - Professional relationship, we just finished making love. - That's not the point. - What is the point? - Barbara, you are an experiment. I arranged for that tape recording to play while you were in the study, no one else heard it. - What? - For years, it's been bothering me, Barbara. Can a person who is normal be driven into a psychotic state just by being told that they are psychotic? Your initial reaction when you came back to the group was staggering, it validated all my thinking. - I don't believe you. - Don't you see what this means? - It means you're out of your fucking mind is what it means. - I couldn't hope to find a better subject than you. - Do you have any qualms about manipulating people, doctor? - Intelligent, psychologically sound? - What am I to you, a white mouse? - You got some experience in the field. - Why, why doctor? To get me so crazy that I'd hop into bed with you? - Come on, Barbara. - What's wrong, doctor, you're ashamed of your body? - Barbara, I thought you were more mature than that. - You know, I'm going to report you. And by the time I finish with the Committee on Professional Ethics. - Barbara. - You're not gonna be able to practice jack shit anymore. - Barbara. - You're not going to be able to teach anywhere. I'm gonna get you so nailed to the wall. - [Bramwell] Barbara. - You are never going to be able to see anyone. (screams) Kit. - How interesting. Transvestite for a roommate. Your case history gets more fascinating by every minute, Barbara. Your friends on the committee will be enthralled. Now, I suppose you two psychopaths would like to be left alone. - Bramwell, wait. (suspenseful music) (glass shatters) (screams) (body collapses) What have you done? - Leave him alone. Leave him alone! Now, you've been a naughty girl, Barbara. And I'm gonna have to punish you. - Kit, Kit. - No. I'm Nurse Mayall. And as your head nurse, it's my responsibility to take care of my girls. - Yes, nurse, responsibility. But your first responsibility is to the patient. He's bleeding. - Let him bleed. How dare you correct me? Your head nurse? Your teacher? I was hoping that you'd still be within reach. But now that I see you're not, I'm afraid I'm going to have to. - You're absolutely right. I do need your help, and I need your guidance. But the patient needs it even more. You're the only one that can save him now. Haven't you always taught me that no man's life can be allowed to be drained out of him as long as we can help him. - Alright. But you assist me. (soft piano music) (knife thuds against table) (elevator opens) - [Voiceover] Dr. Charles Mills, report to Dr. Manucci's office. (humming) (gasps) (tray collapses) - Oh my God, oh, could you please give me a hand? Oh, thank you so much. I don't know how in the world this happened, I was, I am so clumsy, I just, I was walking. - Oh, don't worry about it, we'll have it picked up here in a couple of minutes. - Fell out of my hands, you know I did the same damned thing - [Man] What's your name? - last week, Janice, and I'm sorry, thank you. - Don't worry, about it, it's alright. Take a couple of minutes. - Thank you so very much, I really appreciate it. - What's your phone number? - [Voiceover] Paging Dr. George Chatera, Dr. George Chatera. (jazz music) - Burt, I find your appearance inexcusable. Your hair is shoddy and unkempt. I find it hard to believe that a grown man could let such a beard grow like that, and not take the - Bye, Mr. Bailey, sir. - Goodbye, Mr. Bailey. It's been a pleasure having you. - Bye, honky bitch. (laughter) (door shuts) - Nielsen, is it quiet around here? - [Nielsen] Yeah. How was your lunch? - Good, you eaten? - Yeah. - How's the clown inside? - Why? - Hey, dammit. Damn sons of bitches are loose. (upbeat rock music) Hold it, lady. I want your car, I'm the police. - I couldn't give a shit who you are. - Move over, lady, and shut up and keep your head down. (car screeches) - [Lady] I need to see my mother, the poor dear, she's absolutely dying. - [Kelly] Lady, those are killers. - [Lady] Oh, killers shmillers, now you get out of my car, who the hell do you think you are? Now, listen, I've got to pick up Lauren, that's my daughter, at the dentist at three. Hey, now just stop right here, I have got no time. (car accelerates) Listen mister, who do you think is paying your wages? Well, I pay taxes. - [Kelly] Lady. (car brakes screech) (screams) - [Lady] How dare you talk to me like that. - [Kelly] I'll talk to you any way I want. Damn it. - [Lady] I will not be spoken to like this. (car accelerates) Now I am tired of this treatment. (screams) (screams) - [Kelly] Keep your mouth shut and your head down, or you'll get it blown off. - [Lady] Now, you give me back those keys or I am going to call the police. - [Kelly] Hey, I am the police! - [Lady] I am writing the congressman, I will writ the president. (screams) (slow rock music) (upbeat rock music) (semi-truck horn honking) - Hey, come on, you're gonna get yourself on them? - Look, I ain't slept in three days. (gunshots) (upbeat rock music) - [Jude] Oh man, he blew that dude away, huh? - [John] Yo baby, you sure used that shotgun, Lance. (laughter) - My man, Curt. (laughter) - Hey, can you stop this bleeding? - It'll stop, just relax. - Yeah, those nurses, they'll take care of you. (truck screeching) - [John] Hey, you in the drivers seat, I'm talking to you. - Hey, what's wrong with him? Hey, what's wrong with him, why can't he drive straight? - [Lance] Yo, be cool man, be cool man, he's doing alright. (country music) (laughter) - What's wrong with your friend? Hey, come on, man, what the fuck are you doing? (car zooms by) - [Janice] Slap him! - No, you slap him, you know him better. (shouting in truck) (truck screeches) (car peels out) - Hey man, look, we gotta to get to where we're going. (cars honk) - Janice] Kyle, what's the matter? (all shouting) - Quiet, man, I'm taking you all to my own colony. - What's wrong with the dude, man? - Speed? Damn, he's a speed freak, man. (upbeat rock music) - Hey, man, can we get it together, Jack? The cops, the fuzz is coming. - [John] Cops? Yeah, the pigs man. (police siren) (all shouting in truck) - [Janice] Dynamite! - [Jude] Here you go. (screaming) (car screeches) (explosion) (laughter) - [John] Boy, you a chump age fool. (upbeat rock music) (soft piano music) (slow rock music) (soft keyboard music)
