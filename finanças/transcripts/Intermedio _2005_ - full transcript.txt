My son's birthday is next week. - [Dayton] This is primo stuff, Billy. You'd be able to buy Matt like, a fuckin' horse with this stash. (ominous music) (whispering) - What? What? Did it just get colder in here? - There! (growling) (ominous music) (eerie music) (birds chirping) (ominous music) Blow, blow. They got me messed up on death row. - New toy? - Oh come on, live a little, wouldja? - Oh, god. - You gotta check this bitch out. - Pffftt.

What's with the gimp? - Ha, she fell. (chuckles) - Evidently. - Want some breakfast? - No, fuck no, man, I'm way too worked up to eat. - And why is that, Cappy? - I'm glad you asked, Crutches. Come on. Okay, so I was cleaning out my uncle Carlos' place the other day, you know for some extra cash? - [Malik] Crazy Carlos. - Yeah, I mean, whatever, whatever. We've all seen and heard the stories, but check this out. This is great. - What are you gettin' at, man? - Alright, I know a guy, alright? He said that he would meet us halfway. - Uh huh, halfway f-f-for what? - For 200 pounds of loveboat, okay? Heeba cheeba. And we man cometh. - Dude, you're crazy. We're connoisseurs, man, not-- - Not drug dealers. - This ain't jama bama, okay? The primo bud, the stuff that we can get on the other side, it's twice as good as the stuff over in L.A. I mean, not to mention, half the price. I mean, we could trade this, this, this sweet leaf straight up for cocaine in Pasadena. - Cocaine? - Yeah, bud's one thing. Cocaine? It's 10-15 upstate. - [Barbie] I am not a drug dealer. - As usual, I mean, you're not listening. I mean, we're not gonna have anything to do with cocaine, okay? I was just using it to measure how good this weed is, and how important this trip is, comprende? - Well, what's our take? - [Barbie] Okay, you're not really thinking. - It's three grand a pound. - Okay, that's a whole lotta take. - Un butt fucking believable. This is amazing. - [Malik] What is it, Gen? - These are the tunnels that our dads went into. - [Barbie] And what? - [Malik] And nothing. Went south to Mexico and never came back. Sad fucking story. - Okay, screw the shit weed, you guys. You know what this means, Em? - [Barbie] What does that mean? You know these tunnels? - Yeah, she's been trying to get me to go down in those tunnels since our fathers... (eerie music) - This is our chance, Em. I mean, it's fate. Don't you wanna find out, Em? I mean this is what we've always talked about. - No, that's what you've always talked about. - You're telling me you don't wanna find out? So you don't wanna know if our dads just left us for Mexico or if something else happened in those tunnels? (sighs) - I'll go if you go. (sighs) - You sure you know where this is? - [Wes] Sure as shit. - Where the hell are we? And how do we know this is even right? (sighs) (ominous music) - This is right. - Yeah, this, this looks familiar, I think. - That's what you said and hour ago. Look out! - [Wes] Oh shit, shit, shit! I think I hit him. - [Barbie] Where the hell did he go? - [Gen] Malik, it's that, it's that guy, it's him. - [Malik] Dude, did you hit him? - [Wes] Fuck, guys, the truck won't start. - [Barbie] I am not walking with these crutches. - [Wes] Quit your bitching. It's right here. (eerie music) - [Wes] Come on, guys, hurry up. (eerie music) (snap) (speaks foreign language) - What did he say, Wes? - He said, "Good luck." "Have a good time, I hope the foot heals." - Well, I'm not even gonna ask about the chicken. - You don't, you don't need to. - Some Mexicans believe that, you know, the souls in the body is the blood. It's an offering. - Okay, guys, can we get on with this? - They say that if you catch a dead man's blood before it hits the ground, you get eternal protection. (ominous music) You can even control the dead. (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) - Death row? (sighs) (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) - Shit. - Yeah, it smells like my grandma's house. - Oh, this'll be fun. What, what was that? - Maybe it was that crossing kid. - Please don't start. - Whoa, whoa, what crossing kid? - Some father killed his kid down here years back. - Oh, and I thought my dad was an asshole. - Chill, we got enough juice to get to the border and back. - I hope you're not afraid of the dark. - Hooo hooo hooo whaaaa! (ominous music) - [Wes] Come on, people, let's move. - [Gen] Are you sure you know where you're going? - [Wes] I'm sure as shit. It's a tunnel, alright? You go straight. - [Gen] I just don't want an Intermedio crawling up my ass. - [Wes] Oooh. Is it wrong for me to be aroused by that? - [Barbie] Okay, what's an Intermedio? - [Wes] It's nothing. It's, like, some rural Mexican nada. - [Gen] Trust me, you don't wanna know. - [Malik] Hey, I think she deserves to know, come on. - [Barbie] What? What's going on? - Let's move it, here. - No, just tell me. - Okay, El Intermedio, alright? It's the in between. It's like an old Spanish myth. It's not a big deal. - In between what? - Alright. They're stuck in between the living and the dead. I mean, the Spanish thought that the El Intermedios were, like, trapped souls or some shit. - So, what does this have to do with us? - These dudes are in between existence and, uh, they're in the dirt. They're pissed off, so anybody who comes through here is dead. - [Barbie] Why didn't you guys tell me about this? - [Wes] Okay, listen, you don't have to stay. You can go back. - It's true, Barbie, you don't have to stay. - So, these in betweens are walkin' around right now down here in these tunnels, I presume? - So they say. - Who's they? - Urban legends, sweetie. - And you believe this? - Maybe I do. - You know when you see somethin' out of the corner of your eye and you look, and it's not there? -Easy there, tiger. - And you see a reflection. And you look and you realize it's yours, but it's really not. - So, how do you get away? - You mean, how do kill something that's already dead? When you see it, you run, but even then can't get away. - So, when we die, people like you and me, this is what we become? - Well, it depends on if you believe in legends, sweetheart. Arrrgh! - Ah! (chuckles) - Okay, you are an asshole. - Oh, come on. Well, I mean, who's my pretty girl? Hmmm? Who's my good girl? Who wants to come ride in the car with me? - Okay, screw you. - Unh, come on, I'm not gettin' any tonight? (ominous music) - Hey, what are, what are these things, here? - Oh, those? Those are um, those are safehouses. Halfway points in case the cops bust the tunnel. - Or the Intermedios bust down the other end. What? You're the only ones allowed to be twisted? - Yeah. - Yup. (chuckles) - Why don't you two just get it over with and just do it right now, hmmm? - It's gotta be her sweet ass, right? - Thanks for noticing. 'Tis hard right now. (ominous music) - Wes? Wes? (eerie music) (water bubbles) Ugh. What the fuck? (breathing heavily) - Ah! (screams) (chuckles) - You, you dick! Did you see there was this... - Wes, you ass, my god. - Look, I wasn't doin' anything. I mean, Miss Skiboot here's just a little jumpy. - Well, Jesus, can you blame her? - There was, I mean, I don't know. - Alright you guys. Let's see. Um, yeah the map says we're supposed to go left, so, so, we'll go left. - Okay, alright, yeah. Well, let's hurry it up. How long 'til we meet the contacts? - Supposed to meet 'em halfway. - Well, it's, it's not exactly halfway. - What do you mean, not exactly? - Well, they got a little spooked out about coming the whole way 'cause of you know, the ghosts and everything, so-- - Yeah, Wes, but you told us we were gonna meet 'em halfway. - Well, it's, it's, it's a little more than halfway, now. - What's a little more? - Well, a few minutes from their entrance. - What? - Okay, I think that we should rethink this and we should go back. - Okay, there is nothing to think about, here. If we turn back now we lose 60 grand, alright and you lose, you lose your farmhouse. Alright? A place to live and your chance to get out of that steel fuckin' town. Alright? Gimme this. I say we stop bitching, and then we pick up the pace. - Um, yeah, we're gonna have to sprint outta here. - Dude, you get that green on your back it won't even matter, alright? It's all good. Carlos is in on it, it's fine. - I say, I say we go. - [Barbie] But-- - But nothing. We're going. - You don't have to listen to her. - Uh, he doesn't have to listen to you. - Okay, this is Jerry fucking Springer here, alright? We're wasting time, we're wasting green and generator. - Okay, let's do this. (smooches) - You didn't come back here for the money, did you? - No, actually, I just wanna know that my father didn't just run straight the fuck to Mexico. Come on. What are you doin' here? Come on, let's go, let's go. (ominous music) (glass shattering) - So, what's your daddy gonna say when he finds out you're down here with us? - I hope he never finds me again, actually. (mumbles) - She doesn't have it as easy as you think. - Yeah, well, at least she has a dad. - You know what? I miss him every day, but I don't let it run my life. Maybe you should try that, too. (sighs) (ominous music) - [Gen] Malik, hey, wait up. Hell. So, uh, where's your girlfriend? - Why you out of breath? (eerie music) - Is that Eternity you're wearing? - CK One, but close. - Dismount.

I have, like, all these memories and it's like, I don't know if I'm even loved. - Yeah. - Today, wouldja? So, you finally got the balls to come a little further down the tunnel, huh? - Okay, didn't think you'd come through. Now, bag, Cappy.
