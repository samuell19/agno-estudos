Payroll Office - Ground Floor Laboratory - 1st Floor That means we'll be done soon. Yes, I assume by tomorrow. By the way, professor, if it's alright with you, why don't we increase the pressure level? By one level. About 2.08. If you don't need me tomorrow, professor, I'd like to spend the weekend on the countryside. Yes certainly, Louise. Aren't you afraid? All by yourself in your cabin in the woods? I enjoy solitude. We're off work, Dr. Vogel. Yes, yes. I'm almost done. Goodbye, professor. Have fun! Goodbye, Dr. Vogel. Have a nice weekend! Thanks. Max Vogel speaking. I repeat: All devices are running for the experiment. The refraction coefficient peaks at the following values: Firstly ... How are you, Janke? Doing well, Kramer, how about yourself? May I give you a ride? No need. Thank you, professor. -Goodbye, professor. - Goodbye My eldest daughter is getting married next week. - No way! - Yes. - Will you come? - But of course! - Good evening, Kramer. - Good evening, professor. - Evening, Janke. Let's go home. Rita. I'm calling to let you know I'll be home late today. ...Yes. Yes! I still have to... Visit some friends. As you wish, Paul. What's that? Your keys? Hold on, let me check. Yes, they're here. You forgot to take them with you. The laboratory? I thought you were going to visit friends? Do what you want. Well? How about it? But Johnny, I don't have any. Then, how am I supposed to do business? Didn't we want to go on holiday together? Be alone for a while? And... Enjoy life? You're so stingy, Rita. See you. Hello? Yes, could I please speak with Professor von Lomm? Ms. Weber. No, I'll try again later, thank you. The Invisible Man This experiment should be exciting for the both of us. I won't hurt you. The meter reads... 13, 14.5... [OUT OF SERVICE] Well, Emma-darling? It's almost 11. The professor is expecting you to serve him tea. Every time when it gets exciting! Come on, get moving. I'll tell you what happened later. Your tea is ready, professor. Thank you. Put it over there. Yes, professor. Goodnight, professor. Thank you. Put it over there. Still working, Doctor? It's almost 11 o'clock. Yes, yes, I know. Cute little guy you got here! Excuse me. I can't stand to watch this. Where did the guinea pig go? It's gone! But... this is... Impossible! Excuse me, Doctor. It must be the alcohol. I need to finish my patrol. After an injection under the skin, and following the intake of the NV by the cell tissue, after at most 35 seconds, the negative-effect was reached . That means, the refraction coefficient was reduced to 0. Thereby, the test subject was made invisible. Hello? May I speak with Walter Vogel? Yes, tell him his brother is calling. Thank you. Hudson. Stockings you can rely on. And... cut. Ria, a little more charm, pretty please. Walter, why don't you give her a line without an s. One she can get through without lisping. A call for Walter Vogel! Okay, I'm coming. There you go, pick one yourself. Millions of women wear the fashionably elegant stockings by Hudson. Excellent. Try this sentence, kiddo, but spare no effort! You want to work in film, don't you? Can't I say what I'm really feeling, for once? For God's sake! Even under the rough hands of a petulant, Hudson's stockings stay elegant. No! What was that? In role 6, Lars Gietzschke is rehearsing for the new Edgar Wallace. Who is the producer? Matze Schwarzer. If you're a good girl, I'll introduce you. Max, I have no idea about your "coefficient". You're completely nuts. Now-- Now be reasonable. - Let's go out for dinner with Helen Tonight? Yes. Yes, I'm listening. It's Max. You urgently need to come up with a new slogan. Yes, I'm coming soon. What?! With a human? And I'm supposed to believe that? They're waiting. Vogel! Yes, I'm not deaf! Wait a moment, Max. I'll be right back. I will now repeat the experiment on myself. This time with an increased dose. Come closer. Come on. How much longer do we need to wait? Anyone with a hairpin could open this. When we break it open, there'll be a lot of noise, boss. Let him. We're almost done. Don't be so nervous, Fl√∂te. Why would I be nervous? Pick it up! Lights off! You idiot! Alright! Now let's hurry. It'll take a few minutes. You're joking. And what if he comes back? - Well then, here are the explosives. - Okay. Alright Max, I'm back. Hey! Are you still there? Hey, Max! What's going on? Say something! He's such a nutcase. He's feeding his guinea pigs while listening to jazz. That's Max as we know him. He hung up! Excuse me for disturbing you once again. My keys, I've-- Oh, you are here as well. - Stay here! - Rocco! Blow it open! What? The door won't open. Fred, shoot it open! Hey Max! It's your turn today. Everyday he oversleeps, everyday ... Ouch! Hey, come on in, Helen. I'm making coffee right now. Need a shave, Miss? Pardon me. I wasn't expecting you, gentlemen. Police! Oh, better lock him up. Are you Dr. Max Vogel? No, that would be my brother. What is this all about? My name is Walter Vogel. We'd like to have a word with your brother. Alright then. And who are you? This is my bride, Helen Roland. From the press? No, I'm a photographer in film. Hey Max, you've got some visitors. He's stays up all night working. It's a real problem. Windows. Locked. Usually he comes in through the door. What a strange habit, indeed. Perhaps you should check under the bed. I'm afraid I must ask you to come with me. Good morning. You could do me a favour. What is it? Does your boss have a television yet? Oh, I see. You're too late. He's had one for a hundred years. Save your breath. He doesn't think much of it anyway. I don't understand that. That western last night, for example! He's seen it. Boring, he said. So he talks to you about these things? You've got a nice boss. You should judge for yourself. Commissioner Brinkmann. I see. I've already heard about what happened in the factory. A tragic incident. So you already know? I just called the institute and told them I'll come in late. Because of the car. Kramer, the night watch... He's dead. Kramer... I'd like to ask you some questions, professor. Always at your disposal, commissioner. We could drive to the institute together, if you don't mind. My car is over there. Somebody cut the alarm system, and let them in. And night watch Kramer knew this person. Otherwise he would've been more vigilant. He stood there, enjoyed himself and then bang. Isn't that right? I don't know. Unfortunately, Doctor Weber. Very misfortunate. Your memory seems unusually weak. You don't even remember when you got home this morning. And you don't remember where you were last night. I don't. I was inebriated! And lost consciousness. Fine, some people would say I was dead drunk! I'm sorry. What a preposterous story. Let me through! What's going on here? Dr. Vogel...? Doctor Richard. Please come on in. But please don't step on the chalk marks. Why were you drinking? Is it against the law? There are plenty reasons to drink. That's true. And which one was yours? Is this an interrogation? Would you, as a scientist, consider the possibility that a man could... Turn himself invisible? What do you mean by that? Invisible. Transparent. However you want to call it. Nonsense. Everything points towards Max's guilt. It's exasperating. Could it really have been him? That's absurd. I'm afraid your conviction won't impress the police. How could he just disappear like that? Maybe he's been abducted. Abducted? Well, where would he have gone by his own volition? Mr. Vogel, the commissioner would like to speak with you again. - Yes, right away. - I'm sorry. I'm out of time. I have to go to the studio. Alright, goodbye dear. But Doctor Weber thinks it's possible. I haven't said that. I said that science and research will make it possible someday. Come in, Mr. Vogel. That isn't Mr. Vogel. Yes, it is. Walter Vogel, Max's brother. He was so kind as to tell us of a certain phone call. A very odd phone call. Isn't that right, Mr. Vogel? Your brother called you yesterday and claimed that he had found a way to turn objects invisible, right? An animal. He said he turned an animal invisible. Pfennig? So? Tell me. A single gunshot from a distance of 2 metres? In the heart? Caliber 765? Immediate death? At 11 o'clock last night? Thank you. So Kramer knew his killer. And what else did your brother say? Nothing. He hung up. What do you make of that? Commissioner, my brother is an esteemed scientist. But this whole thing strikes me as rather fantastical. I couldn't agree more. The question that remains is, what is the purpose of this obviously made-up story? Let me give you the answer. He doesn't want anyone to suspect him of being involved with the break-in. - Impossible, commissioner. - Oh really? And who drove his car? His car was seen driving out of the yard. Immediately after the murder. The license plate was clearly identified. But-- You, as his brother, were supposed to give him an alibi. He called you and told you this fairytale about invisibility. Commissioner, my brother is neither a criminal nor a fool. - He mentioned a refraction... - Coefficient. His experiments dealt with refraction coefficients. Correct. Professor Lomm, Commissioner Pfennig. We experiment with dyeing substances, nothing out of the ordinary. Why all these suspicions? Max Vogel is a man dedicated entirely to his work. He's my assistant and I fully trust him . Dr. Richard, what are you doing here? I changed my mind. I decided not to go to the countryside after all. Were you planning on leaving us? Dr. Richard was going to go on vacation this weekend. Was there a special reason to stay? Not at all, it's just that... It started raining. Hold on. It only started raining after midnight. Dr. Richard, please tell us where you spent the evening. At home, of course. By yourself? Yes. By myself. What are you doing over there? Don't touch anything! This belongs to me. Wait a minute. This is mine. I lent it to my brother. He listens to this kind of music while working. Chief inspector, take a look at this. Where did this animal come from? It was under the closet. Give it to me! You don't know how to treat it right. Commissioner! Maybe this is the animal on which my brother experimented. Nothing escapes you, huh? And that's supposed to be invisible? It must be on strike. Fine, take your tape player with you. Cut! Thanks. It's a wrap! Thank God. Finally. Hold on! Please leave the lights on. I'd like to take some more photos. Ria, keep your legs in the same position as before, okay? Alright, now please repeat that line one more time. Hudson stockings. Perfect color, shape and fit. Hello darling. Ah, hello Walter. Well, are you done filming? What about Max? Nothing. Been looking for him for hours. Visited all of his friends. I'm starting to get seriously worried. Nobody has seen him. It's as if the earth had swallowed him up. Not a single trace. Have you checked at home yet? No, I'm on my way there. I just wanted to check up on you. Well, I'm done here. I just need to develop a few photos. - Can't I do that in your kitchen? - Sure Do I really have to stand still that long? Oh forgive me, Ria. You can stop now, thank you. Let's go. You look tired. Where did I leave my camera? - You probably left it in the car. - Oh right. - I'll go get it for you. - Don't. I'll get it myself. Max? What happened here? Walter... - Freeze, or I'll shoot! - Careful, Helen! Are you hurt? I'm still alive. In any case, this guy wasn't invisible. He simply took out the fuse. Have a look and see what you can do, please. What a mean trick. Attacked with the door, eh? Honestly, it was a good idea. I should use it in my next screenplay. Hey Helen, take a look at this! What is it? Walter, you're bleeding! A piece of his jacket. Well, if this doesn't look like a nice bump. That can hardly be avoided. Some people may even think it was me. I don't think so. We're not married yet, are we? This place is a mess. Hey Walter, look over there. What is that? My darling Helen, you're great. A casino token. Maybe this is a clue that can lead us to Max. How do you mean? I don't believe this was a random burglar. Your idea, an abduction, is the only explanation for the disappearance of Max. Surely this guy was here to look for something related to Max's invention. The chip? Well, with this we might be able to trace our visitor. He must have lost it when the bag was torn off. Yes, of course! He has gambled and he'll gamble again. Otherwise he would have cashed out this valuable chip. - Exactly, I'm going to investigate. I'm coming with you! No, no. You have to notify the police. Here. I'm taking this chip with me. To the "Koko-Club". If this isn't a pleasant surprise. - Please excuse my Intrusiveness. - On the contrary, Ms. Weber! How else will I find any reason to put off my work? And such a charming reason at that. - Shall I make tea? - No, no. Thanks Emma. - Would you like a drink? - Gladly. What's the matter? Why have you come here? Oh, I need to ask you for a favour. That's very careless of you, Rita. Especially that this unlucky accident has given us enough to worry about. It was you who said I should come to you whenever I need something! I'm really sorry, but... You happen to be my only friend. Your husband seems to be doing better. Paul? I can't make sense of him. It's been going on for many months now. He comes home late, he sleep on the couch. And money? "Only a few more days, then we'll have enough of it", he says. Did he mention how he wants to make money? He would never say how. That creeper. Rita, you're a little cold beast. But so enchanting. And you're very tender. What a lovely ring. Many times I've been enthralled by it. My wedding ring... I had to sell it. If it's that bad, why didn't you come sooner? Oh, I've called many times. Last time, yesterday night. Your driver told me on the phone that you didn't want to be disturbed. When was that? Around 11. How strange. The police interrogated my husband yesterday. They were determined to find out where he was last night. And can you imagine that? They even questioned him about me. And... Have they questioned you yet? No, they'll do that tomorrow afternoon. What do you think? Should I tell them the truth? After all I can prove that I was home and... And your driver knows that I called him at that time. Yes? Professor, I-- - Oh, excuse me. - What's going on, Janke? I had an accident, a car accident. I'm sorry, but it really wasn't my fault. No reason to be upset. Your jacket is dirty. Please wait outside. I'm sorry. Wait a few minutes, Rita. We'll make everything alright. ‚ô™ Madelyne was fair ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The boss quite liked her shoulder strap‚ô™ ‚ô™ As luck would have it then ‚ô™ ‚ô™ She once sat in Jackie's lap ‚ô™ ‚ô™ But at 11:30 he paid his debt ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Jackie's corpse was found completely full with lead ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The orchestra played its cha-cha-cha ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Just like that the spirits were high once more ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I really don't know ‚ô™ ‚ô™ How I could bear ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Any other ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Atmosphere ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I really don't know ‚ô™ ‚ô™ How I could bear ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Any other ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Atmosphere ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Old MacDonald had seen ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Seen what happened on that night ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Unfortunate for him ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The only witness left to find ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And at 11:40 he just dropped to the ground ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And ever since then Old MacDonald remains unfound ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The orchestra played its cha-cha-cha ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Just like that the spirits were high once more ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I really don't know ‚ô™ ‚ô™ How I could bear ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Any other ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Atmosphere ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I really don't know how I could bear ‚ô™ - Why don't you sit over there? -No, thank you.

Mr. Fatogeau! 16, 29, yes? There you go. Place your bets. 12, red. Pardon madame, this belongs to me. - Are you calling me a thief? - Yes, I am. - This gentleman is in the right! - No, the baroness is in the right! Give me my money or there will be trouble. The lady bet on that number. I tell you, the gentleman bet on red. She's tried this trick on me before. Unbelievable. What one has to put up with these days. What if he doesn't come? We can't contact Janke. The police is after him. The murder of that night watch spells trouble. Janke's partner will tell us what went wrong. That must be him. Such a high bet? I wouldn't take risks like that. - There you go, sir. - Merci. Whoops. I think that's mine. Excuse me. I was lost in thought. No harm done. Would you gift it to me? What do I get in return? Could I talk to you for a minute? Of course. We can talk as much as you like. - Please look after my money. - Yes sir. Place your bets. 12, red. So you are working in film? Yes, I'm just a screenplay writer. We're currently shooting a commercial. That's how it goes sometimes. This place is cozy. Come with me. What would you like? The same as you, please. Looks like someone fled so as not to disturb us. Tell me, does your lucky chip guarantee success? I haven't won that much money with it yet. Cheers. How much were you planning on winning? That's a matter of luck, I think. Who did you get this chip from? Mr. ...? Vogel. Walter Vogel. It came into my possession recently. Out with it, Walter Vogel. Where did you get the chip from? My compliments, madame. Charming invitation. Forgive me. But our situation leaves us no choice. What else could one want? A full house? Music? Let's stop joking around. The boss asked you a question, big guy. Strange. Sometimes I am a little hard of hearing. Little guy. Vogel, the boss asked you a question. You're not going to risk it. Alright gentlemen. That's much better. Why don't we discuss over drinks? Now out with it. Where's my brother? Your brother? Yes, I believe I made myself clear. My brother. Would you at least tell us who your lost brother is? Yes. Where could he be, your brother? Where could he be? You know very well that my brother is a scientist working in the Geler factory. When you found out about his invisibility formula, you abducted him. Invisible? People too? Yes, invisible. Listen, this formula intrigues me. Invisible, you say? If that's really true, then... Are you claiming that you have no part in the disappearance of my brother? Naive, isn't he? If we had kidnapped your brother, then all of us would be invisible now, don't you think? There. Get a gun license. I'm now going to repeat the experiment on myself. - Max? - This time with a higher dose. Max? The puncture of the injection feels normal. Max? My pulse rate is regular. My vision is unchanged. - Who's there - I am feeling cold. My pulse is-- Who's there? What else have you found in the flat? None, commissioner. So much for that lead. Half the people in town wear suits like that. This Janker fellow has been convicted and served two years for burglary. I had a feeling that this wasn't the first time I had seen him. Funny. What's funny? His brother, a distinguished professor, employs an ex-convict as his driver. Since his release 3 years ago, no reports have been filed against him. Thanks Kretschmer. One more thing. Find out who his cellmates were. Yes sir. Did you check Professor Lomm's alibi? Clean. Two witnesses. Janker and the housekeeper. She served him tea at exactly 11 o'clock. At exactly 11 o'clock... Please connect me with Commissioner Grabsch from Traffic Police. Don't tell me you've been speeding again? I only want to borrow a car with a radar. I see. With that you're sure to catch our invisible culprit. Very original! But believe me, Brinkmann, what you can't see with your own eyes, you won't see on your radar screen. Invisible! Phew! That'd be something. I'd pay a visit to Brigitte Bardot! Poor Bardot. The invisibility will wear off eventually. Shut up. Invisible! I'd eat all day. Nobody could call me fatso anymore. Shut up, fatso. Eating and Bardot? No. Invisible in the Bank of England. Or taking a look at the crown jewels. Money. - Cabbage! - Dough! ...Dosh! Quit it! Maybe Janke knew about this formula. Or maybe his partner did. We still don't know who he is. Maybe it was Vogel after all. And his brother, that scientist, is the murderer. He is the invisible man! But wouldn't he have taken his share of the money then? Another possibility is that someone is interested in this peculiar invention. Fl√∂te, this is a job for you. Follow Janke, I want to know who he meets with. Maybe there is still an opportunity to complete our project. Get the blueprints. Okay, boss. If we get our hands on that formula, we can get it done. Do you have the money? It's in my hotel suite. You were supposed to bring part of it here. I have, darling. Oh. Guess where I put it. Cold, cold, cold, cold. Warm. Warmer. Hot! - Thanks. - Oh Charley! Do we really need to share the money with the others? Unfortunately. I would make myself so pretty for you. Have you told the Commissioner about the photos? No, I haven't developed them yet. Are you sure of what you saw? Couldn't it have been a reflection? Walter, photography is my profession. I checked the negatives thoroughly. Yes, but wait a moment. He was invisible, wasn't he? There are different types of rays that are invisible to the human eye. Infrared light, for example. But on the photograph they are visible. It's similar to how objects appear on a radar. Show them to me again. There. Yes, you're right. It kind of looks like the outline of a person. And where was the voice coming from? From the tape player. It was the voice of Max. He was talking about his research. Then it wasn't Max who wanted that tape. He wouldn't have run away from you. You're right. Somebody must have been monitoring Max's research until he completed it. Somebody that knew what he was working on and understood it scientifically. Exactly. And now he needs the tape. He doesn't want anyone else to know about the invention. But I don't think this person was that burglar. He wasn't invisible. Maybe he sent someone else first. Besides, why do we keep saying "he"? Does this look like a man to you? You mean, it could have been a woman? Of course. One that understands these experiments very well. Now that you mention it, she was in a great hurry to take the test animal. That could be it. Let's go. Nice place for a weekend vacation, huh? Should we go inside? Be careful, Helen! But Helen, we can't just break in. Remember, Max might be here. Hello? Is anyone there? Dr. Richard! That's the kitchen. The dishes are dirty. Bedroom. No one's there. Walter! Take a look at this. Professor von Lomm. He's about 10 years younger here. Interesting. A gift for her boss. Or perhaps a lonely woman's longing. Helen, have a look. A fully equipped lab. - Walter? - Hm? This looks just like Max's guinea pig. It must be hungry. Who knows how long it hasn't been fed. Are you hungry? Ouch! Show me. The bastard bit me! What's going on here? How dare you just break into my home. What happened with your finger? The guinea pig is apparently not a vegetarian. For Heaven's sake! Take off your coat. Quickly! Why? Hey, what are you doing? What's that for? Don't talk so much. What are you looking for here? My brother. Unroll your sleeve already. What is that stuff? Just do what she says, Walter. What is that for? See? Are they dead? Did they use to share the same cage? Yes. Then they were bitten as well. It's a kind of rabies. Now leave already. Leave! Walter, come here and let me nurse your finger. It might get infected. Okay. Tell me something, do you still think that Doctor Richard... More than ever. Why did she help me then? Let's think this through. The murderer fled the scene in my brother's car. He likely took Max with him. However, if the experiment was a success, then Max was at this point invisible. Yes, and he took your brother with him to confuse the police by involving Max. In all likelihood, he was listening in on that call between you and Max. Maybe now he's following us. After all, we've found out quite a bit. My dear, he's invisible. And insane! We can say that for sure. Rabid! Let's go. Lotte? Are you still here? Are you really not done yet? I've been working as quickly as possible. In the kitchen there was a three-day-old pile of dirty dishes. I'll sweep, then I'm done. It won't take long. Stop working for today. I want to be alone. Are you expecting someone? I'm not quite done with the bedroom yet. I haven't emptied the ashtrays yet. It's draughty. Close the door behind you! Fine, I'm going then. Goodbye. Lotte, was that you? Johnny? Johnny, I know it's you. Come on out already. Say something already! Johnny, say something-- Charley! It was you who shot him! You're crazy. So you were watching television with the housekeeper. But she remembers leaving the room to serve the professor tea. But that hardly took longer than a few minutes. I can tell you the content of the movie. That doesn't mean much. It was a rerun. Who were your cellmates back then? I don't remember. Would you like a reminder? Rudolf Marften. - Who's that? - His nickname is "Fl√∂te". Oh, him. Janke, you've got a criminal record. Now you're the private driver of a renowned scientist. You have access to the institute at any time. You know everything about the factory. You know the exact times the wage payments arrive and everything else. He needs no more than that. His accomplices are ready And on television is running something you've seen already. The perfect alibi. But suddenly things go wrong. Night watch Kramer shows up. It wasn't me! Kramer was my friend! My best friend. That's why he trusted you. You took him with you, went up one floor. Further away from the payroll office. "Kramer, old friend! How about a drink in the lab? It's more comfortable there." Kramer enjoyed a drink now and then when he was with a friend. Then Kramer heard some noise coming from downstairs. He became uneasy, suspicious. He decided to go and have a look. But that's when you shot your friend in cold blood. No! I... I don't get it. Why in the laboratory? In the papers it was written that he... in that shootout downstairs... In the hallway... In the payroll office! I... No, I... I swear, I... I didn't do it. I swear...! Commissioner, Professor Long is calling to speak with you. If it wasn't you, Janker, then it was a friend of yours. Where is your friend, Fl√∂te? I don't know. I have no idea. Why in the laboratory...? Police Headquarters What happened? Was one of you in the lab on the second floor? No, why? Kramer was killed there. But if it wasn't one of you, then it can only be-- What did you say? Nothing. The boss wants to speak with you. Later. It's urgent. There's something I need to do first. Come on, I'll wait. Next stop. Police! Who was sitting in the seat behind him? No one. No one sat behind him. I swear to that. How was I supposed to know...? There was just... There was just so much cleaning left to be done. And what do you know about him? What do you know about Johnny Benentini? That greaseball! I've seen him before. Who knows what he's always up to here! Have you seen him here today? No, but the lady was expecting him. Who let you in? Who? Answer me! You're being suspected of murder. Who gave you the key? Who...? Rita herself, of course. I've had it for quite some time. You pig! You call me pig, you idiot? That's enough! You walking pomade commercial! What did you expect, Doctor Weber? When you didn't reek of alcohol, you reeked of chemicals. She was a fine lady. Don't tell me you think that I was the only one. Just ask your boss. The professor. You make me sick. There are so many scumbags like you. One could saturate the moon with all the unloving husbands in this world. If anyone here is guilty, it's him! That's enough, Benentini. - Arrest him - But why me? I told you the truth. Nothing but the truth. How much does the police know? They don't know what they're doing. But I've got some new info. The killer is invisible! First, there was nothing and then... Well, nothing again. Nonsense. He killed Janke. I was there! So that invention really exists. That scoundrel tricked us. As he did back then in the Geler factory. We diverted the attention from him and he ran off with the invention. I changed my mind. I'd rather visit Brigitte Bardot first. Shut up. Fine, break into the Bank of England first, if you like. We can swap later. Oh, quit quarreling. I don't like the climate in this town anyway. Fred, prepare everything for our departure. Alright boss. Rocco, go over the blueprints of the bank one more time. Cora, wait for me in the hotel. Have the money ready. But stay in your room until I call you. Where are you going, boss? We'll meet tomorrow morning at 10 in the garage. Although I'm not sure... If I'll make it. Mon ch√©ri, can't you tell me? I need to know where you're going. This is the Payroll Office. Rocco. Go check if anyone's there. It's just... I have a bad feeling about this. No one's there. Very interesting. Poor Janke... How did this coat get here? In Janke's wardrobe...? I've been looking for it everywhere. Isn't it his? No, it belongs to the professor. But there's no way Janke stole it. How long has it been missing? Well, since... Yesterday morning! When I wanted to do the laundry. Will the professor be back soon? He said, he'd be home late. Do you know where he is? He didn't mention it, but... Doctor Richard called this morning from her country house. I told the other gentleman as much. What other gentleman? He was here a while ago. He was dressed well. He wore a checkered hat, white gloves and... He said, he's from the police too. Is that so? I'd like to see the professor's quarters after I'm done here. I just remembered, I haven't had breakfast today. Could you make me some tea, please? And please show me the professor's quarters, alright? Yes, of course. Thank you. Put it over there. Yes, professor. Oh! Thank you. Put it over-- Well, isn't this evidence? No court would accept this as evidence. Where did Brinkmann go? He investigates by himself so much. And when you need him, he's nowhere to be found. Does anyone here find the story of the invisible man credible? Why don't you tell me where your brother is? Wasn't it him that started this whole ghost story? My brother dedicates himself entirely to his research. He experimented without considering the consequences. - He couldn't have known that-- - That his invention turns people mad. That there would be a whole series of violent murders terrorizing the city. The murderer must be insane. And how do you know that, Miss Roland? There. What is that? Just a harmless little bite wound. From a guinea pig. It shared a cage with three others. It bit the others and they died. Don't you understand, Chief Commissioner? This drug gives people rabies too. Don't tell me the guinea pig was with... Doctor Louise Richard. Search the house! That's Professor Lomm's car! Brinkmann. Peter... God Almighty. Don't touch anything! You stay here! "House. Empty." "Lomm. Dead." "Looking for gang leader Charley Nelson." Chief Commissioner! There's a corpse in the basement. You can put this ring in the professor's estate. The coat too. All other clothes were burned to the ground. I simply don't understand. Dead. The dear professor dead. He was such a good man. What am I supposed to do without him? Try to calm Miss Emma down. The poor girl has helped us a lot. Without her we would never have identified the professor. Poor Brinkmann. He suspected Lomm of having murdered Rita Weber. But why? Maybe she blackmailed him. She knew that he wasn't home the night of the murder. Now it's up to us. Perhaps... It wasn't Max! Well, where is he? Well, where is Doctor Louise Richard? And Doctor Weber? We're looking for them. Don't forget about the invisible man. No rational person would take that fairytale seriously. The bus driver does. And Rita Weber's cleaning lady too. If there ever was an invisible man, he's dead now. Hotel Savoy, good evening. Good evening. Yes, room 13. I'll pass you on. - Good evening. What can I do for you? - We'd like a double room. One moment, gentlemen. Thank you very much. Good evening. We don't have any double rooms left. I can offer you two single rooms for the same prize. Could I see your identification? Thank you very much. Please register your name here. Please excuse me. Switchboard speaking. What's that? Madame Cora? This is Cora. Who am I speaking with? Oh Charley. Thank God. Why are you speaking so quietly? Where are you? Yes, of course. I've got the money. To the parking lot? Yes, right away, Charley. Yes, dear? Yes? I'm coming downstairs. Yes, Madame Cora? Mr. Walter Vogel, ABC studio? Do you have his number? Yes? Thank you, I will connect you. ABC studio? Yes, could you please connect me with Walter Vogel? Have you been to the Koko club again? No, the police closed down the club. A call for Walter Vogel! I'm coming! Hopefully it's... Please answer the call on my behalf. Max? What is it? We found your brother. Who? Cora? Yes, it's urgent. Helen Roland? So you're his fianc√©e. Listen to me! The invisible man is not Charley Nelson! Listen! I can tell by his voice. The man who called me just now had a-- Hello...? Hello? Hello? Where did you find his body? The caller was Cora from the Savoy Hotel. According to her, the invisible man is not Charley Nelson. We were disconnected. - Did you say Savoy Hotel? - Yes. I'll send someone there right away. Are you coming with me? Yes, of course. They've found Max. He's dead. - We're going now. Will you with us? - I only need to develop more photos. Walter will pick me up later. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. It's tragic that this is the way in which your brother's innocence was proven. His corpse has already been taken to forensics. - Report from the Savoy Hotel. - Yes? That night club singer Cora was strangled with a telephone cord. Who could have killed her? Nobody was there. The chambermaid was on that floor the whole time. Commissioner, don't you understand? It was him! The invisible man! Cora thought it was Nelson. When she found out that it wasn't him... He silenced her. Yes. Maybe you're right. Anybody that knows too much is being killed off. Commissioner. Helen! Helen is still in the studio and knows as much as Cora did. No! No! Help! No! Help! Help! Shut off the area! Bauer! Go to that door over there! Quickly! Let's go this way! Through the cutting rooms! Helen! Helen! Walter! Helen, where are you? Over here! - Walter! - Darling! Are you alright? Oh Walter... The invisible man... Chief Commissioner! Take a look at this, Chief Inspector! Goodness gracious. I didn't expect this. Let her bring away. So it's true. So she was the invisible person? She doesn't look invisible to me. Have you seen the syringe? Oh Walter... Come darling, it's over now. Let's go. Walter. Walter! Now I remember exactly Cora said. She said that Charley Nelson is not the invisible man. "The man who called me is..." It's alright, darling. We're leaving. I'll be with you soon. To the headquarters. I've got you now! I'm asking you one last time. Where is Doctor Weber? I don't know. But you knew about the drug used in the experiment. That it makes people go mad. You even had the antidote with you. Why did you take it with you to the studio? I wanted to save Helen. From whom? From the invisible man. From the invisible man! But... That's impossible. There you have him, Chief Commissioner Don't worry, he won't try anything. No... That's not possible. Yes, it is. Open your eyes already! Start talking. Why did you kill my brother? A cigarette, please. Alright. Why? Max Vogel was merely a talent that followed the path I had laid out for him. I'm a genius. That he perfected the formula before I did was just a coincidence... To his misfortune. Doctor Richard tried to restrain me from it all. She isn't strong enough to be truly great. And why Kramer? The break-in into the payroll office served me as a distraction. My personal driver, Janke, knew the gang. He thought I was interested in money. He had no idea what my actual motives were. The night watch fell victim to his own forgetfulness. He returned to the laboratory to retrieve his keys. He saw me. And Rita Weber? Rita Weber could have refuted my alibi. She was stupid. Nothing of value was lost. With Janke it was different. Unfortunately he found out that I shot his friend Kramer. Stop! I can't deal with it anymore. You have no right to end the lives of those people, but you did. And you covered it up! It's the natural right of the √úbermensch. Doctor Weber, the courts will decide that. You won't have the opportunity to do so. Professor von Lomm? I thought he died in the fire? The man who died in the fire was Charley Nelson. He tried to blackmail the professor, to get his hands on the formula. Don't be afraid, dear. It's finally over.
