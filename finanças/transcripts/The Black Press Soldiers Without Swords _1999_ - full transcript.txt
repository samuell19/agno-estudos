We never participated in anything of a scientific achievement. We were truly invisible, unless we committed a crime. But in the Black press, the negro press, we did get married. They showed us our babies being born. They showed us graduating. They showed our PhDs. The Black press never pretended to be objective because it didn't see the white press being objective. And it often took a position. It had an attitude. This was a press of advocacy. There was news but the news had an admitted and a deliberate slant. ♪♪♪ For over 150 years, African-American newspapers were among the strongest institutions in Black America. They helped to create and stabilize communities. They spoke forcefully for the political and economic interests of their readers on employing thousands.

Only 15 are qualified to vote. Freedom is a great blessing indeed to them. They swell our list of paupers, they are indolent and uncivil, and yet, if a Black man commits a crime, we have more interest made for him than for a white." Mordecai Noah, New York Enquirer, Tuesday, November 21, 1826. In the early 19th century, African-Americans were routinely vilified in the pages of the mainstream press and had no way to respond. By the winter of 1827, an outraged community had had enough. Free Blacks gathered on Varick Street in lower Manhattan and decided that they, too, would use the press as a weapon. They pooled their money and started the first newspaper in the United States to be published by African-Americans: Freedom's Journal. Their whole idea behind Freedom's Journal was to have a voice, an independent voice, an autonomous voice for African-Americans. That opening editorial on the front page of Freedom's Journal says,"We mean to plead our own cause." -"No longer shall others speak for us." What they were saying is that we don't mind having white abolitionists plead on our behalf but we can do it better, and they saw the media as one of the only outlets available for them. Public expression was one of the few weapons that Blacks had. ♪suspenseful music♪ Chosen as the editors of Freedom's Journal were 28-year-old John Russwurm, one of the first Black graduates of an American University, and 32-year-old preacher Samuel Cornish. In their inaugural issue, Russwurm and Cornish set out a clear vision for the first Black newspaper. "In presenting our first number to our patrons, we feel all the diffidence of persons entering upon a new and untried line of business." "Useful knowledge of every kind and every thing that relates to Africa shall find a ready admission into our columns, proving that the natives are neither so ignorant nor stupid as they have generally been supposed to be." "Whatever concerns us as a people will ever find a ready admission into the Freedoms Journal, interwoven with the all the principle news of the day." Freedom's Journal, March 16, 1827. ♪suspenseful music♪ Two years after its founding, Freedom's Journal closed following a dispute between Russwurm and Cornish over the direction of the paper. It was short-lived, but Freedom's Journal paved the way for 24 other Black newspapers published before the Civil War. ♪dark dramatic music♪ The most influential of the pre-war papers appeared in 1847 with abolitionist leader Frederick Douglas as its editor. In the first issue of The North Star, Douglas also emphasized the need for an independent Black press. "In the grand struggle for liberty and equality now waging, it is meet, right, and essential that there should arise in our ranks authors and editors as well as orators, for it is in these capacities that the most permanent good can be rendered to our cause." Fredrick Douglas, December 3, 1847. Presidents read Fredrick Douglas' newspaper, although they might not admit it. Senators and congressmen read Fredrick Douglas' newspapers. So Fredrick Douglas made it very clear that if you're going to have a movement, if you're going to have a public voice, and if you're going to advocate for social change, the press is vital to that effort. ♪No more driver's lash for me ♪ ♪No more♪ ♪No more♪ ♪No more driver's lash for me♪ ♪Many thousands go♪ As slaves, African-Americans were forbidden to read.

Hayes withdrew federal protection for the freed slaves. Once Reconstruction ended, the newspapers were able to maintain a foothold. They did, however, have to be cautious. They had to step lightly in many of those communities where Jim Crow really controlled the climate of the South. The white South called it "redemption," but for African-Americans, the post-Reconstruction period was a reign of terror. Mob violence directed at Black Americans was ignored by the federal government and condoned by southern white newspapers. ♪dark dramatic music♪ "There is nothing which so fills the soul with horror, loathing, and fury as the outraging of a white woman by a negro.

"It is a sacred convention that white women can never feel passion of any sort, high or low, for a Black man. Unfortunately, facts don't always square with the convention, and then, if the guilty pair are found out, the thing is christened an outrage at once and the woman is practically forced to join in hounding down the partner of her shame." On June 4, 1892, while Ida B Wells was in New York on her first trip north, her paper, The Memphis Free Speech, was attacked by a lynch mob. They actually destroyed this woman's press and intended to destroy her body -- take her life -- to the extent that she walked the streets with a pistol under her blouse or apron, according to legend -- two pistols on occasion. ♪dark dramatic music♪ Fearing for her life, Wells did not return south for 30 years. She continued her ground-breaking work on the staff of The New York Age. She really set the stage for very radical very activist kind of Black journalism. And as a Black woman, she was also an inspiration because there was so few African-American woman who had worked in journalism before, and when they did, it tended to be sort of a social service-oriented journalism, not this sort of powerful, radical, vociferous journalism that said, "We won't stand for this. We must do something about the kinds of violence affecting African-Americans." ♪classical music♪ In 1893, the year after Wells was chased from Memphis, the Columbian Exposition opened up in Chicago. At the cost of $28 million, it was the largest and most expensive event of its kind in history. The purpose of the fair was to showcase American ingenuity to the world, but its omission of African-Americans from exhibits on US history prompted Ida B Wells and Fredrick Douglas to issue a pamphlet and protest. ♪dramatic music♪ The Exposition's organizers offered to set aside one day for African-Americans: Colored American Day. The white press ridiculed the idea. Wells denounced it. But finally, Fredrick Douglas accepted the compromise and agreed to speak. ♪upbeat piano music♪ On the morning of August 25, 1893, nearly 3.000 Black Americans donned starched collars, bustles, and top hats, and came out to enjoy the day.

His presence at Fredrick Douglas' speech that day would change Abbott's life and redirect the course of African-American journalism. Abbott sat in Festival Hall as Fredrick Douglas rose to address the audience. At 75, Douglas was visibly slowed by age. His hands shook. His voice faltered. The question will be asked-- then is asked by our transatlantic visitors: Why we did not... As Douglas began to speak, a rowdy group of whites tried to shout him down. Douglas threw aside his prepared text and drew himself up to his full commanding height. His voice rumbled through the cavernous hall. Men talk of the negro problem. There is no negro problem. The problem is whether the American people have honesty enough, loyalty enough, honor enough, patriotism enough to live up to their own constitution.

And what's interesting is all three of these people are journalists. -I think Abbott's physical presence at the fair -- mingling with so many of the leaders and vibrant voices of Black America -- led him to believe that America could truly become what the promise of America talked about.

'Birth of a Nation,' directed by DW Griffith, depicted Reconstruction-era Black legislators in hideous caricature and celebrated Ku Klux Klan violence. The mainstream press hailed 'Birth of a Nation' as a landmark cinematic achievement. The African-American press, rallied by Charlotta Bass, reacted with outrage. And Black newspapers, from The California Eagle right there in Hollywood to newspapers all across the country, really raised the specter of how heinous this film was and how damaging it was to Black communities. We of The Eagle pioneered in an important field of social struggle: the struggle to make the film industry responsible morally for the content of its products, the struggle to lift higher artistic standards in the entertainment world, standards reflecting a sense of social duty and propriety rather than prejudice and vain glory. ♪"Illinois Blues" by Skip James♪ Shortly before Charlotta Bass migrated to California, Robert S Abbott left the South for Chicago. He dreamed at the new world he glimpsed at the Columbian Exhibition.

He first tried in Chicago to be a printer. That's what he was trained to be at Hampton Institute. But becoming a full-time craftsman as a printer was simply impossible because of racial discrimination. He next tried law school, and in fact, he graduated from law school. He was the only African-American in his class at law school. He was discouraged from entering the practice of law. He was told, "You are too dark to make an impact on a white judge," and he turned to journalism. -And in 1905, established The Chicago Defender, which he started from his landlady's dining room table. And then, he went outside folding newspapers himself and he built the paper up from nothing. And by 1910, he had a growing concern. The first issue of The Chicago Defender, with a press run of 300 copies, appeared on March 4, 1905 with a showmanship and hyperbole that was to make him a fortune. Abbott heralded the four-page paper as "the world's greatest weekly." ♪light jazz♪ The Defender was sold in Chicago in the Midwest on consignment through individual agents. As the orders poured in, Abbott made a decision that would change his fortune and shape the future for thousands of others. He sent The Defender into the South, home to 90 percent of the African-American population. There, The Defender had a potential Black audience nearly 200 times larger than in Chicago -- an audience that was hungry to hear what Abbott had to say. ♪harmonica and piano jazz♪ In the South at that time, the Blacks-- he couldn't speak up, if he spoke up in any kind of ways for, like, for himself, or what he wanted to do, which was making a progress, it just didn't work. In other words, he was censored. -The Defender would say things like "When the white fiends come to the door, shoot them down." "When the mob comes, take at least one with you." Those were things that, if you were a Black southern newspaper, if you were a newspaper editor in Birmingham, Alabama, you can't say that because your newspaper is going to get torched or you're going to get run out of town. Robert Abbott could say it, and so Black southerns came to see him as a man they could trust. ♪harmonica and piano jazz♪ Within a decade, The Defender outsold every African-American newspaper in the country, and Robert S Abbott, the son of former slaves, was on his way to becoming the most powerful Black man in the nation. By 1920, The Defender's circulation soared to over 100.000. Each copy passed through the hands to at least to five readers. And Abbott's paper and its message reached more than half a million African-Americans each week. In the South, The Defender was read aloud in homes, in barber shops, on street corners, and in churches. -I was a little boy. My brother was much older than I, and I was so happy that I could not read because my grandfather an ex-slave, who was illiterate -- we didn't know it at the time -- would make my brother as a little boy read The Chicago Defender from page to page, including the ads. Then, he would make him go back and say, "Read that again, boy." He wanted to hear about what was going on in different parts of the world. This was, I guess, my grandfather's way of realizing he was a free man: a Black newspaper from up north. ♪"Chicago Bound Blues" by Ida Cox♪ Abbott's Defender caught on when he began to use some of the same techniques that the white publications had been using. Abbott was probably the first Black newspaper to go for the big, bold headlines. And, of course, when the lynching seasons opened, of course he gave those big, gloried headlines about the treatment of Black people. ♪somber singing♪ Between 1882 and 1919, 3.000 African-Americans were murdered by lynch mobs -- one every four and half days. These murders, often ignored by the mainstream press, were kept on the front pages of Black newspapers.

During the South, at the slightest provocation, they would take a man from his house -- we know that story -- and castrate him while they would rape their woman and so forth. And that was no way for that news to get out, so The Defender talked against that kind of thing. As Abbott lashed out against lynching, bitter sarcasm became a hallmark of The Defender's style. "54 lynchings occurred in the United States during the year 1914, six more than during the preceding year, only 49 of the 54 being colored, showing conclusively that a grievous error was made somewhere. Think of it: five white men lynched! It seems that we can have nothing exclusive. Lynching was a form of punishment especially prepared for us -- at least that is what we have been led to believe. Perhaps the fun wasn't coming fast and furious enough so they threw in a few of their own number for good measure." Robert Abbott, January 9, 1915. The racism of the mainstream press was another favorite target to Abbott's ridicule. One of the things that white newspapers did in the early 20th century was whenever they would mentioned somebody who was African-American, they would put in parentheses in his or her name "negro." So it would say, "Jack Johnson won the World Heavyweight Championship yesterday." What Robert Abbott did in response to that was he simply decided that he should treat white people equally. So it would say, "Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany yesterday." ♪"How Ya' Gonna Keep 'Em Down On The Farm" by Jim Europe's 369th U.S. Infantry Band♪ During World War I, industrial production in the North rose to record levels, creating thousands of new jobs. But the draft left far fewer workers to fill them. Beginning in 1914, when the war started in Europe, very few European immigrants were able to come to the United States. Eventually, they turned to African-Americans as the only available labor supply, so new opportunities opened in Chicago -- would have been steel mills and packing houses. ♪slow jazz♪ The Chicago Defender has always advised southern Blacks to stay at home and fight for their rights, but in response to the economic opportunities created by the war, Abbott reversed his position. With characteristic enthusiasm, Abbott used the full resources of the paper -- articles, editorials, cartoons, poems, and even songs -- in a campaign to urge The Defender's readers to come north. The paper even printed train schedules one-way to Chicago. Try to imagine living in a small southern town where there is simply not as much going on as there is a place like Chicago. You read your Defender and you find out there are nine movie theaters in Chicago's African-American neighborhood, you find out that there are nightclubs, you read in The Defender about the Eighth Illinois Regiment, which was an African-American National Guard regiment that marches through the streets carrying rifles. To a Black southerner, this is very exciting. -There is no doubt that The Chicago Defender was responsible for thousands upon thousands of people of getting the word that they didn't have to be satisfied where they were physically located -- that was in the South -- and that there was a place where they could physically move to the North -- whether it was Chicago; or Detroit; or Rockville, Illinois; or Cleveland -- there was a place they could move to where they could live their lives as to the fullest. ♪"I'm Going To That City" by Sister O.M. Terrell♪ ♪♪♪ Many Black southerners, before they left the South, wrote to the North asking for information, and many cases, they would write to The Defender -- to Robert Abbott, himself -- because they had such faith in him. For example,"Dear sir, permit me to inform you that I have had the pleasure of reading The Defender for the first time in my life, as I never dreamed that there were such a race paper..." "All about the South and the race and the North. Now, I am thinking of coming this fall..." "I like the work all right, but they don't pay enough to get myself a good hat. I would like to be a maid." "Please, don't publish this because we have to whisper this around among ourselves because the white folks are angry now because the negroes are going north." "To come north, east, or west. Anywhere but the South." That's a letter written in May of 1917 from Port Arthur, Texas. And the letters that we have from Black southerners come from large cities, small towns, rural communities, and they all have this kind of emotion -- this sense of hope and this sense of faith that comes in part from reading The Chicago Defender. ♪"Goin' Up the Country" by Barbecue Bob♪ When the Great Migration really first began in the fall of 1916, white southerners at first really didn't pay it much heed, because they were sure that when the Blacks went north, they would get cold; they felt that African-Americans were somehow biologically unsuited to the cold weather and they'd come back. That didn't happen. And what happened was as landlords, as other employers began to realize that their workers were leaving, they began to try to stop people from leaving, which meant try to confiscate The Chicago Defender. They would even have the police go up onto railroad platforms and arrest people for vagrancy. ♪slow jazz♪ With more than 10.000 Black people leaving each month, the South's economy suffered and its leaders grew desperate. Some towns, ignoring the Constitution, even banned the sale of Black papers to triy and stem the tide of the migration. In Somerville, Tennessee, a petition ordered that no colored newspapers be circulated, and that every "darky" must read the local white paper. But Robert Abbott, the shrewd marketer, asked for help from the one group of African-Americans who traveled freely through the South. - Robert Abbott had a real problem: how could he circulate his paper in the South? So he goes out to the railroad yard to one of the most distinguished professions in the Black community at that time, the sleeping car porters, and he hands them bundles of his newspapers, which they hide in the train. And as these trains roll through the South, instead of being put off at the stations like they used to be, which are in the town limits or the city limits, these porters would step out between cars or the back of the train toss them out in the countryside. And suddenly, all these southern cities found they couldn't stop the Black newspapers no matter what they did. ♪blues music♪ Warren H Harris of Chambers County, Alabama had only a third grade education, but after reading The Defender, he left Alabama for Chicago.

Black newspapers showed the full spectrum of life in Black communities. In return, African-American readers treated newspaper men and women with respect and adulation. In the mainstream press, Black journalists were denied opportunity to practice their craft and earn a living, but in their world, they were stars.

They had to take what they could get. The absence of large revenue-generating ads forced Black newspapers into a constant scramble to boost circulation. Many were in continual financial trouble, and hard-hitting journalism had to share space with outrageous ads. But the lack of large advertisers had its advantages. We had our freedom as the newspaper, to report things as we saw it. The reason why is because we did not have any dependency on big advertisers, corporations, what have you. The ads we had were ads about the skin ads, hair ads, if you're impotent, how to increase your-- how to increase yourself as a man, so forth like that. And these were small ads.

And Napoleon might have had Black blood, and if he didn't have it, Josephine certainly did. -And we would read that, and sometimes, we would laugh because he'd had it that we were royalty and all that, and we didn't know anything about royalty -- you know, we Blacks royal anywhere. We were the pharaohs of Egypt, we were the chiefs of all the tribes in Africa, we were all these things. He was really right in many instances, but we had such a poor image of ourselves that we would ridicule it. But yet, I would find myself not missing it -- reading it, reading it, and pouring over it. It just started me on my growth, my maturation process, I guess, of not denigrating self. ♪light jazz♪ At a time when jobs were unavailable to Blacks at mainstream papers, Black newspapers were a training ground for African-American lithographers, press men, and typographers. For artist and writers, Black newspapers could be an important launching pad. Author and poet Langston Hughes was a newspaper correspondent in 1937. Pulitzer Prize-winner Gwendolyn Brooks wrote poetry for The Chicago Defender while still a teenager. And the celebrated artist Romare Bearden began his career as a cartoonist for The Afro American in 1936. The Black press also trained a legion of photographers who shaped images of African-Americans through their own lens. I was into numbers and I liked pictures, and I didn't want to, you know, get raided or something like that. I just-- when I told my brother, "I'm quitting the numbers, I want to take pictures." ♪light jazz♪ It's kind of difficult to hold it like I did then. And you hold it and get in focus and then gave instructions to your subjects and take the picture. Everything would be just perfect. At that time, lightbulbs-- flash lightbulbs -- were expensive. The Courier only gave Teenie a certain amount of money for the lightbulbs. I would take seven to eight, 10 pictures. I said, "Well, that's silly." - So he would take-- - make certain that one shot-- that one shot was the shot. And I would put it up like this and I would put it up and flam... Catch the bulb, and that's why they called me "One Time." They also called him "Teenie Little Lover," 'cause he had a way with the women. Well, I liked to see the girls. I got a kick out of that. It didn't feel bad to be the only woman, like I was in the way of some photographer's picture. I would challenge him. Sometimes they'd say,"Well, you didn't get anything," and I say, "Well, it's better than you got, I'm sure." We constantly, at that time, were fighting for a certain image, a certain feeling. And we really worked hard at it, put the best foot forward in every picture. ♪light jazz♪ An expanding African-American community turned newspapers in to profitable businesses and major employers. The larger papers had their own printing presses that would get the papers to their own delivery trucks, which would put them in the hands of an army eager newsboys. Some papers, like Marcus Garvey's Negro World, was short-lived, but others became dynasties. The Scott family's Atlanta World grew to be one of the few Black daily newspapers. The Baltimore Afro American, started by the Murphy family in 1892, would continue to be published by the Murphy's more than a hundred years later. Between the wars, a new Black press emerged. Many papers had both political and economic strength: The Amsterdam News in New York, The Norfolk Journal and Guide in Virginia, and the paper that after World War I would surpass the circulation of The Chicago Defender, Robert Vann's Pittsburgh Courier. During World War I, The Pittsburgh Courier was just another Black newspaper. There was nothing exceptional about it. It was a small newspaper. It was of no real significance in the country. There were a lot of Black newspapers that were the same size. Robert Vann wasn't particularly radical. After the war, though, he saw the chance to start making his newspaper bigger. He wanted to earn more money. And he did several things; one of 'em is he started the first national Black newspaper in terms that he had, like, 15 editions. He had one in New York, he had one in St. Louis, one in Los Angeles, one in Chicago. All around the country in these Black communities, suddenly, they were getting The Pittsburgh Courier, which was different from any other Black newspaper. He would run one position one week, the next week he would change around another position -- anything to get more circulation. -Vann was a politician, statesmen, publisher, and a brilliant lawyer, a severe taskmaster. There was only two ways to do things for him, and the right way was always Vann's way. He was a hard man to reason with, but Bob Vann was a visionary. He could see around the corners. -Mr Vann was a dedicated opportunist, and he went with the wind when it was conducive to his objectives. At one point, he decided that the Black people were being taken for granted by the Republican Party, which was the party of Lincoln in the Black community. In 1932, the country is in the middle of a depression, and there were opportunities, not only for Black people, for himself, he thought. So he gave a speech in Cleveland where he suggested he saw millions of Black people turning Lincoln's picture to the wall. This became a rallying cry for Blacks to leave the Republican Party and to become Democrats. He wanted to help his people, but in helping his people, he also helped himself. After Roosevelt was elected in 1932, Vann was rewarded for bringing Black voters to the Democratic Party with an appointment as an Assistant Attorney General. He continued as publisher of The Courier, enhancing the paper by hiring many of the best minds in the country. The radical intellectual WEB DuBois shared spaces as a columnist with a conservative George Schuyler and with Marcus Garvey, the leader of Back to Africa Movement. Writer and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston wrote for The Courier. Columns like "As the Indian Sees it," "Africa Speaks," and a "White Man's Views" offered a diversity of opinion and created the ongoing debate that was the paper's hallmark. At its height, The Courier had 15 columnists, more than any other paper in the country. When Vann died in 1940, he left The Courier as the most powerful Black newspaper in the nation. -The Courier meant everything to me. It was my way out -- my way out of feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, and a feeling of not having any merit, any worth. I would harm myself out to people, ask them to take me on. One white man said he wouldn't teach a nigger anything, and I offered to work for nothing for him. That was a type of milieu that we were living in at that time. The Courier represented power for Black people, and we never had any power, so The Courier represent something entirely different. ♪jazz music♪ By the end of the 1930s, Black newspapers had reached new heights of circulation and influence. But the Black press would be tested during the World War II, when the papers took on their biggest and most powerful opponent: the United States government. December 7, 1941: a date which will live in infamy. ♪"In The Army Now" by Big Bill Broonzy♪ The United States' entry into World War II lead to an outpouring of American patriotism. Many whites and mainstream newspapers were zealous cheerleaders. But for Black Americans, the enthusiasm for the war effort was often tempered by the bitter realities of segregation. James Thompson, a cafeteria worker from Wichita, Kansas, suggested in a letter to The Pittsburgh Courier that African-Americans use the war overseas to press for change in their own backyard. ♪melancholic music♪ "Should I sacrifice my life to live 'half-American?' Will things be better for the next generation in the peace to follow? Let we colored Americans adopt the double V for a double victory -- the first V for victory over our enemies from without, the second V for victory over our enemies from within." When this young fellow Thompson came up with the idea of the double Vs -- victory at home and victory abroad -- it fit right into all that we lived for. -Victory in Europe and in the Pacific, but victory in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Chicago and Harlem and Detroit as well, meaning a victory against racism. -And so, The Courier came out with this Double V campaign, and of course, it spread; we embraced it, hugged it, loved it. Yeah, that's right, that's what we did. ♪dramatic music♪ The Courier received thousands of letters and telegrams in support of James Thompson's idea. To capitalize on its readers' sentiments, the ever-pragmatic Courier stepped up the Double V campaign. The Pittsburgh Courier had a neat diagram, which was this double V with an eagle in the middle, and people loved this kind of diagram. And you had women walking around with double Vs on their dresses, you had a new hairstyle called the "Doubler," where women were walking around and weaved two Vs into their hair, you had double V baseball games, double V flag-waving ceremonies, double V gardens. I mean, it's just double V this, double V this, double V this... And The Pittsburgh Courier, which was looking for circulation, played this to the hilt. ♪big band music♪ There was even a double V song. ♪"A Yankee Doodle Tan " by Andy Razaf and JC Johnson♪ We were at war, and in war, you don't have friendly relationships; you're out to kill each other. And so that's the way it was with The Courier; we worked to try to kill Jim Crow and racism. -Now, how would the press do this? How would you balance your criticisms of America at home and maybe some of the hypocrisies involved in the war effort abroad without sounding seditious? It was very difficult. And the government felt that if these injustices are played up, maybe Blacks will refuse to support the war. Maybe they'll even go out and blow up powerplants, railroad lines... They never did this, but the feeling was-- I mean, that was expressed in government documents, "We don't know what's going to happen. We don't know if we could win without 10 percent of the country." Now, what they didn't seem to understand that we had every valid reason to fight for full citizenship at home if we were expected to give our lives overseas. ♪melancholic music♪ Maddie Black reluctantly handed her teenage son a letter in August of 1943. He was drafted into the US Army. Timuel Black reported to 6230 Vernon Avenue in Chicago and was sent by train to Camp Custer in Michigan. The Army, for me, was a very bad experience -- hated every minute of it. But it was uplifting when the Black papers would come through. It was a morale-booster because usually, the papers were told what Black soldiers were doing. We read The Courier and it was somebody who-- it was a friend, it was a friend who kept us, let us know that they were looking out for our interest. ♪melancholic music♪ But the military considered the Black press an enemy. It made every effort to keep African-American newspapers from the troops. You had the Army take a number of these Black newspapers and not allow them to come into the post libraries anymore. The Army said, "We don't think this is good, you can't read it." On a number of bases, you had papers that were taken away from newsboys -- Black newspapers. They had paper burnings. I mean, you think about the fact you had books that were burned in Germany. Well, you had newspaper burnings in World War II in this country. ♪melancholic music♪ It was unofficial military policy to place Black troops under the command of southern white officers because, according to the Army, southern whites knew best how to "handle" the negro. It was a Jim Crow army of a Jim Crow country. Even the blood supply was segregated. When racial violence erupted within the Army, Black newspapers took it as their duty to report the assault of Black soldiers by their own countrymen. Blacks and whites are fighting each other in the Army camps. They're killing each other off. And the Black press just played this up to the hilt. On the front pages, it reached its kind of hype when one of the papers snuck a photographer into one of these camps during one of these pitch battles and took a bunch of pictures and came back and plastered them on the front page, which angered the government. The Black press had to report on these riots -- honestly, accurately -- to its Black readers. The federal government did not want information flowing across the country that might hurt national morale. -They wanted to shut us down because we were doing something which held the whole United States of American government up to the ridicule of the whole world. How could you go somewhere and fight for democracy when you have people that you are oppressing by law at home? -Now, Edgar Hoover decided that the Black press was dangerous to America's wellbeing in the war, and he did all within his power to accuse them of sedition. Hoover had the presidency -- he had almost every president -- and Roosevelt was no exception. Roosevelt was gullible. He was a fine president, but he was gullible. He didn't have the guts to just tell Hoover, "No" -- the word no. All he had to do with J Edgar Hoover was to say, "What part of no you don't understand?" ♪dramatic music♪ J Edgar Hoover orchestrated hearings before a select committee of congress. Frank Bolden, one of the first two African-American war correspondents, was summoned to Washington from his post in Burma. I just got a notice one day that I was wanted in Washington to report on the condition of the troops, as regards to this double V program that Hoover said was an act of sedition. I only stayed two days because when I found out that it was superfluous and silly, I didn't want to waste my time. The longer I stayed, the more angry I became at Hoover, and I thought I better get out of there before I said something out-of-turn, because I have a very short fuse for neanderthal psycho ceramics -- crackpots. The thing that J Edgar Hoover had to do is that he also had to go through the Attorney General of the Unites States, Francis Biddle. Francis Biddle and J Edgar Hoover aren't the buddies that J Edgar Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt are. ♪dramatic music♪ In 1942, Hoover presented to Attorney General Francis Biddle with lengthy reports on what he saw as seditious activity by the African-American press. He asked Biddle to indict a group of publishers for treason. John Sengstacke had become publisher of The Chicago Defender in 1940 after the death of his uncle, Robert S Abbott. Sengstacke was alarmed by the growing threat of censorship. Well, I think Biddle got the information from President Roosevelt to close up the Black newspapers in this country. And I finally went to Mrs Roosevelt and told her I wanted to see Biddle and talk to him. So in June, mid-June 1942, John Sengstacke, the publisher of The Chicago Defender and the top publisher -- if you want to call him that -- of the Black press, came to the Justice Department building in Washington, and he entered a room, Biddle was there to meet him, and spread out on his table were all these Black newspapers. Biddle says, "See these newspapers? These are hurting the war effort, and if you don't stop writing this stuff, we are going to take some Black publishers to court under the Espionage Act." -I asked, "What are we supposed to do about it? These are facts. And we aren't going to stop, because that's what it's all about." That was what the press was all about: protecting Blacks in this country. You got to realize what an incredible thing that is for Sengstacke to say to Biddle, because Biddle is the Attorney General of the United States, the top law officer. He clearly has the right to take him to court if he wants to. -But after we explained to them what the problem was and we were citizens like everybody else and wanted to be, they had no problems with it. Sengstacke left the Attorney General's office with an extraordinary agreement: Biddle would not prosecute if the newspapers would not escalate their campaign during the war. -Without Biddle being there, Roosevelt would have probably succumbed to Hoover's request to ban the Black press and charge them with sedition. Keep in mind there were more people in this country against the Black press than were for the Black press. Many people thought -- including some African-Americans -- thought the time was not right for us to be asking for elimination of second-class citizenship when the country was at war. As the war ended, the campaign for equality at home and abroad had pushed the combined circulation of Black newspapers to a record high of two million papers a week. But victory at home had yet to be won. The Double V campaign said, "When you come back home, we want the world to be different." It was that simple. And it inspired us, and we came back home with that feeling. I came back home with that feeling -- that I'm not going to take what I used to take, that I'm not going to let them insult my mother and father the way they once did, because we are going to fight back. The Black press was really a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. And you look at the Black papers in that time, and they aren't talking about civil rights. I mean, they are not using those words. But the things that are there -- they are trying to get for the Black community and the Black people -- are civil rights. And if you had not had the Black press in this period from 1910 to 1950 -- if you had not had World War II -- the Civil Rights Movement would have started at a lot lower level than it started in the 1950s. ♪dramatic music♪ In the turbulent post-war years, African-American newspapers were key actors in the quickening struggle for social change. The events of the 1950s and '60s would pose new challenges to Black publishers, but ultimately, for the Black press, the Civil Rights Movement's success would bring a period of its greatest power to an end. I was assigned by PL Prattis, the city editor at that time, to go out and do a series of stories on how you were treated when you went to a restaurant to be served. I went because I had to, but it was an excruciating experience. I was greeted by a waitress who shook her head meaning "No service" -- I soon found out -- the minute I sat at the counter. "I can't serve you a Coke or anything else," she explained. I asked to speak to the manager. He snarled, "Everybody knows I don't serve negroes in here. You must be a stranger, because if you lived in Clairton, you'd know better than to come in here and sit down." And when I went home at night, I was just so hurt, I'd cry myself to sleep.

The post office at one point launched an investigation of her and wanted to revoke the mailing privileges of The California Eagle.

"I want to ask our city council and all the agencies that cry, "Beware of the communist" if the communists are responsible for the prices that have put foods beyond the reach of our poor people, made it impossible for GI negroes and other minorities to live in houses fit for human habitation.

We felt that was really the end of it. That was a terrible label in those days, being called a communist. Discouraged by declining community support and facing stiff competition from the younger and less militant Los Angeles Sentinel, Charlotta Bass sold the The Eagle in 1951.

So I wasn't about to leave the South with my introduction to Dr King that way at that point. -It was the story of the century, yet unfortunately, most did not have the resources to cover the Civil Rights Movement as throughly as they wanted to. Sir, there has been a great deal of turmoil... This also was the time when the white media were beginning to report on what was happening to Blacks.

You could only criticize white America so far. If you criticized them the way we did in the old days, you wouldn't get the advertising.

Even as the papers' numbers have diminished, their voice muted, the need for an independent advocacy press remained. The words written by editors Rustwurm and Cornish in 1827 continued to resonate: "Too long have others spoken for us." -The Black press today seems to react only -- react to an issue or situation, or react to something that is in the white press. We very rarely, in our Black press today, initiate, dig up stories of our own. And I think we do need a Black press today -- very, very much so. We have no voice that tells us about our own lives. Without this network of communication, it has been far more difficult for African-American people to comprehend fully what is happening to them, to be able to have a debate on issues among themselves, and also to develop and to choose their own leaders. -I felt bad, even when I went to work somewhere else, because they taught me how to write, how to make up a newspaper, the value of news, and the value of being truthful.
