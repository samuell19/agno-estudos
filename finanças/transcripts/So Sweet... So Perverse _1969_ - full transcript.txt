My score is twenty out of twenty, Valmont. - What do you think? - Congratulations, Jean. You're the best clay shooter ever. You're cunning, rational, and deadly, but firing at a real target is different. Oh, he'd be even better. Real danger brings out a man's true qualities. Preposterous. I think there's only one thing that brings out a man's qualities. You can only judge a shooter in a real situation. A safari, for instance. I once went on a hunting trip in Kenya. No harmless clay pigeons there. It was all about holding a steady aim while facing some wild beast. It's a completely different situation, believe me. Thanks. My husband just challenged you. Are you going to accept, Jean? Of course. We can do it one of these weekends. We're counting on it. I'm sure it will be very exciting. What's really exciting is discovering that real excitement is becoming harder and harder to find, but still managing to do it every time. Do you still manage it with me? I get it. Sorry about that. It was a tough question. You know, Jean, I would like to make love with you in Africa. Naked in the virgin forest, just the two of us. Like in the day of creation. We were all virgins back then, my dear. The African trip is confirmed, though. I've already told Danielle. She already had the idea of going there for Christmas. Yes, sure. Organize everything with my wife, then get back to me. By the way, Jean, about that money my husband owes you, can you wait a few more days? I have things to do myself, Helene. But I'll see what I can do. - Enjoy your holidays, ma'am. - Thank you. - Clean the car. - Yes, sir. Good evening, Mr. Reynaud. Good evening. Did someone rent the apartment upstairs? Yes, just last evening. My wife will be disappointed. I was thinking about buying it myself. A lady rented it without even bothering to see it. I suggested another apartment. - Goodbye. - Goodbye to you, Mr. Reynaud. So? Who was the lucky woman who helped you relax this afternoon? You're too sarcastic to really be jealous. What answer should I give you? Should I say I look elsewhere for all the things I don't have at home? Why did you marry me, Danielle? I don't know how to answer that now. I guess I just couldn't resist your virile charm. But I disappointed you, isn't that right? No, it was my fault. After all, I never really believed in it. But the institution of marriage has been on the decline lately, I believe. You told me to carry this with me at all times, remember? For my whole life. What went wrong, Danielle? Is it all over? I'll take a shower while you wait for the cigarette case to answer your question. So, this is the unit production for... (INAUDIBLE) Urgent phone call for Mr. Reynaud. Urgent phone call for Mr. Reynaud. Phone call from your wife, engineer. I'm sorry to bother you, but it's her second time calling. - Hello, Danielle. - Hello. Yes... Sorry for calling, I wanted to remind you we have dinner at the Charrier's tonight. - I'll go to... - Excuse me. - Thanks. Jean, are you listening? - Hello? Hello, Jean? - I'm listening, dear. I won't be ready before nine o'clock. Be polite with Mrs. Charrier, she's practically a minister. I'd prepared a note for that Stockholm supply contract. Did you see it? - No. - Oh. I probably mislaid it somewhere. Hello? Jean? Sorry, Danielle. Busy day here. Here it is. Stick it to the note. I'm listening. I also wanted to tell you about the apartment upstairs. The porter asked me for the key he gave us when we went to see it. I can't find it. Did you put it somewhere? Oh, it's in the... Well... It's slipped my mind. Don't worry, dear. I'll try to find it later. That's it! I can't take this anymore! - Cut it out! We're leaving! - No! Hello? Oh, it's you, Mrs. Charrier. Yes, this is Jean Reynaud. How are you doing? I'm afraid I won't be able to make it to your dinner. Work issues, unfortunately. Yes, the usual hassles. Yes. Could I please speak with Danielle? Ah, she's not there yet. No, don't worry, you can tell her once she arrives. Thanks. I'm sorry for disturbing you. Yes... I see. Of course. Very well. I'm sorry, I have a call on the other line. Hello? Is someone there? Anybody home? Don't be afraid. I had the key and I just couldn't resist. I'm not dangerous, see? But you don't... Yes, I know I shouldn't have acted like this, but I heard you screaming and, this will probably sound ridiculous, but the world is so bland today that even the tiniest mystery tickles my curiosity. I'm Jean Reynaud. I'm sorry I scared you. Really. It's not me you're afraid of, right? Is there someone stalking you? Maybe you thought I was that person for a moment. Can I get closer, or are you going to start screaming again? Please, go away. Go away! - Leave me alone. - I want to help you. I believe you need some help. What's your name? Nicole. I came in here like a thief, Nicole. Can we get out of here like two friends? If you're up to it, we could... No! I can't! Leave me alone! I'm really rattled and upset, I need to be left alone! - But, I... - Please, don't. I was given the keys by the porter, before you rented the apartment. Oh, one last thing. I found this in the elevator. Is it yours? You could try to make conversation. It's you who asked me for a ride, after all. Do you believe we still have anything to talk about? I understand. Alienation is all the rage. But it's still just an excuse. Our problems are much simpler. I've always wondered how you manage so much self-control, Danielle. You really think so? Well, let's say I probably unwind at night. When the hired help goes home, and I'm left all alone. All alone in that horrible apartment. Leaving the villa was your decision, correct me if I'm wrong. Please, Jean, I don't want to talk about it anymore. And most of all, let's not mess up this arrangement. Besides, going on like this is doing us good, don't you think? You still have your little distractions, after all. Do you mind taking me to Dior for a minute? I'll be back in a minute. - No! No, I said! - You'll do as I say! - You're crazy, Klaus! - Enough! Let go of me! Please, take me away. Take me away from here. What's his name? Klaus. I despise him with all my heart. No, that's not true. I don't know if I really hate him. But I can't get rid of him. Maybe that's not what I really want. I know, too complicated. You couldn't understand, believe me. - Tired? - No... Actually, I feel much more relaxed now. Listen... We could talk about it. I know it's a personal matter. But I'm asking you to trust me. I can understand how you feel. Nicole... I suffered a nervous breakdown and I was a drug-addict. It took months to get myself clean again. When I got out of the clinic, he was already waiting for me. Maybe he reappeared later, it doesn't make any difference. I didn't have the strength to resist him. Klaus enjoys making me suffer! He has a perverse obsession with me. Every time he takes me I swear it'll be the last, but then he does it again and again... You have to start over, Nicole! I'm here to help you, if you want it. No. - He knows how I feel, it wouldn't change anything. You don't know him... - No. - He's capable of anything! - I'm not afraid of him, Nicole. Tell me if you want me to leave. Are you thinking about Klaus? Try to understand. I can't forget the feeling of his hands on my body. How it felt horrible and strangely beautiful at the same time. How I was so angry and ashamed about feeling that filthy pleasure. I'll never be a normal woman, Jean. Never. You're just scared, that's all. Klaus will always come between us. You finally noticed it. I need some time, Nicole. I'm scared, Jean. - You won't be able to do anything. - You're wrong. I'll make you forget everything. We'll start by leaving tomorrow. You and me. Alone. You forget your wife. I've already taken so much from her. Don't make a big deal of it. Danielle always appreciates when I get out of her sight for a while. Oh, stop trying to find excuses. I'd rather hear the truth, even if it's unpleasant. That's the truth, believe me. I love Danielle. Or I loved her in the past, at least. But we've been married for three years, and for the last two years we've been living separate lives. Like two strangers. Sometimes I even think I disgust her. There aren't any moral issues with what we're doing to Danielle. I know you're awake. I have to leave in the morning. I'll be gone for a few days. Come on! You're a champ! Come on, get in. I won't let you disappear. I really won't. People always say that in the first days, or the first month. Maybe you mean it now, but what about when we get tired of making love? I like you too much. Don't ask me the reason. I don't know. What I know is that I want to stay with you. And that I want to make love together. All right, Jean. I promise I won't disappear. Wake up! We've got a lot to do today! Come on! I have a terrific day planned for us! Well, let's hear it, then. Take a look up there. Take a look at the top. Do you like it? - My gift to you. - No, thanks, I'll pass. - These old castles scare me a bit. - Would you prefer a bungalow in Tahiti? Maybe a cabin on Mount Everest? Don't make too many promises, I might take you seriously. Why can't you believe me? - Why? - I don't know. Perhaps I should have met you before. Before wasting the best years of my life. But now... - But now there's Jean. - Now there's Jean. - You heard the news? - No. It looks like we reached the sea of tranquility. And we're going to stay for another week. Without television, of course. Good girl. I want to see you laughing from now on. Always laughing, just like now. How did he find us? - What sort of stupid game is he playing? - I don't know, but Klaus never plays. We'll go back to Paris tomorrow. Great. A blackout. Jean... Jean? Is that you, Jean? Nicole! It's Klaus! He's here! That's it. I'll teach that idiot to stop hassling me. No, you have to stay away from him. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have involved you. It was a nice break for me, sure, but it's going to have to end. It's for the best. We have to end this relationship now, while we still can. Now listen to me. Yes, I admit it, I started this only because I wanted to take you to bed. But it's different now. Completely different. I love you now. Forget it already. Jean... Klaus sent me here. - What? - It's true, Klaus sent me here. He plotted against you, I'm telling the truth. I had to play the bait. - Stop being foolish. - This is Klaus' specialty, and I've always obeyed him. It's not the first time I've been his accomplice. But, after spending day after day with you, I... I've changed. I can't lie to you anymore, it's time for the truth. It's Klaus who rented the apartment upstairs. He planned every move. I had to arouse your curiosity and encourage you to flirt with me, and... And what? Tell me. He wants to kill you, Jean. What are you talking about? Someone offered him twenty thousand dollars to do it. To kill me? It almost sounds ridiculous. Why? You think no one would want you dead? - Who would? - I don't know who! Klaus didn't want to tell me. You don't know how Klaus is. He's cunning, and he trusts no one. Can't you see that he failed to kill you by pure chance? But I know he'll try again. You've got to stop saying such foolish things. - It's like you see corpses everywhere. - I'm not crazy enough to make this all up! You're in danger. Klaus was here moments ago, unless you think I made him up too! It doesn't make any sense. How can I make you believe me? Give me some proof. Alright. Give me a few days. You'll have your proof. Valmont. - Hello. - Hurry up. I'm closing in five minutes. I'm looking for Mr. Klaus. Do you know where I can find him? I don't. But I wouldn't tell you anyway. Mr. Klaus is too busy at the moment. Besides, we only accept work commissions through another company, which is Publifrance. We never have direct contact with our clients. Not even with Valmont? I never heard that name before. - What do you need from Mr. Klaus? - I'm sure he's got something to tell me. This is for you, if you can help me to find him. Now listen carefully. I've had it with hearing you say you don't know who Valmont is. What about Nicole? You know her? Who's Nicole? Stop taking me for a fool. I'm talking about the girl who came here three weeks ago, you must have seen her. A blonde girl. Blue-eyed. Have you looked me in the eyes? I apologize. Bad luck this morning. - Something wrong? - My hand is shaking, but not for the reason you may think. Poor Jean. I guess it's a nervous breakdown. Tell me about the symptoms. A blonde or a brunette? I apologize for my husband's sense of humor. We haven't heard from you in a week, though. You could have called us. He's too busy, you know. You bet I'm a social protester! I even protest the whole protest movement! It's all good as long as I get paid for modeling. You know how it is in the fashion business, the protesting models are usually the uglier ones! We're lucky to have Danielle, she's kept in touch with Helene. They planned a party tonight at your house. You're going to get bored, trust me. Did you take a look at our new "acquisition?" I don't see anything wrong with sex. We aren't living in the Middle Ages. I heard she's even funnier when she's a bit tipsy. Jean! Idiot! A few more inches and you would have hit him! Was it just an accident, or did you try to kill me? Jean, the gun went off... I was loading the rifle, you saw it. How do you feel, dear? Are you hurt? It's nothing, I'm fine. - Does it hurt? - No. I'm an excellent anesthesiologist. There was a man with a crushed hand during my last safari trip. I spent the entire night with him. Before being taken away by the medivac, he said he didn't feel any pain at all. Very much like general anesthesia. - Will you join us tonight? - Yes. By the way, dear, why don't you also invite the girl from upstairs? Of course. I agree, it's the right time. I'll invite her. Two parts gin, and two parts of martini. Your husband is taking his time coming back downstairs, isn't he? Oh, you know how he is. Jean doesn't mind wasting a few minutes. Especially if he stumbles upon someone like you. - Lose them! - Show it all! Here they come, people. The couple who grabs them will have to make love in front of everyone. No inhibitions. That little savage is taking it a little too far, don't you think? We're all boring bourgeois here, a kiss will be enough. - Do you understand? - Sure! All right, a kiss will be enough. Not a regular kiss, though. Let's try something different, I want a kiss that lasts a full minute. - Alright! - Throw them! - What are you waiting for? - Come on! You have to kiss for a whole minute. It's a game! - A pretty silly one. - Come on, just kiss already! - What does it mean? - Don't make a fuss, Jean. I can vouch for him, he's a specialist. This is Nicole, the new tenant. This is Danielle, my wife. The atmosphere here is becoming more and more promiscuous. I hope it isn't awkward for you. Not at all. Besides, we're only separated by a floor. Come on, what are you waiting for? - We want the kiss! - What a bore! Come here, you'll have to put on a one minute show! Don't waste time, Jean! Lights out! Time's up! If you're looking for Danielle, she left in the middle of the show. I never realized she was the jealous type. Don't be a fool. By the way, why didn't your husband join us? Some business to attend to, he said, but I guess he's still upset about not hitting you this afternoon. I told you it was a mistake bringing me here. It wasn't. I wanted you two to meet. It will be much easier from now on. I know Danielle. Your friends are a little odd, you know? Tell me, have you ever heard of an engineer named Valmont? No, I don't think I know him. Why? It's not important. Excuse me a minute. Danielle... You're crying? You can actually cry? Should I be laughing after the disgusting show I had to witness moments ago? Danielle... Don't tell me you've suddenly become jealous, given the current state of our relationship. I don't want to be humiliated in my own house. Well, color me surprised. - It's always been the opposite until now. - That's enough. - Get out of here! - Of course I will, Danielle. As you wish. And since you know about Nicole, understand I'm serious this time. I want a divorce. - I'm not taking any calls today. - Very well. - Hello? - Jean, it's me. - Oh, it's you. Sorry. - Jean, I really need to see you. I think I have the proof you need. - Come to my apartment tonight. - But, Nicole... Is anything wrong? You sound scared. We can't talk over the phone. Come to my house after midnight. - Listen, I... - Please. Try to understand, don't ask any questions. Come to my place after midnight. Remember that I love you. Hello? Nicole? Hello? Hello? Your conversation went on long enough. Let's wait for him. I hope you don't really want to wait here until tonight. That's a long time to wait. Let's not take any chances. You never know what could happen. - Nicole? - Jean! - Jean! - What happened? Klaus is back! - I wanted to stop him, but I didn't know what to do. - Calm down. Relax. Come on, try to calm down. Drink this. We won't have anything to fear from Klaus anymore. I'll talk to the police and this mess will be over once and for all. I'll have him arrested. They'll put him in an insane asylum. Try to see him for what he really is, paranoid and deranged. The hardest part is done. All we have to do now is put him in the car. I'll make sure they'll find a charred corpse. Just another car accident. Give me the keys! Wait, I've got them. Did you park the car in the back? Look alive! Did you do as I said? - No! I don't want to look at him! - Shut up! We have to keep it together. All of us. - Go back to your apartment, Danielle. I'll call you. - Yes... - Hey. Nasty fall, huh? - Indeed. There they are. Easy. Easy there. - Well? - No skid marks. He didn't realize he was about to crash. Maybe he was asleep. Call his wife. Remember to be tactful. We have to open an investigation to officially identify the body. - His wife needs to be present. - All right, inspector. That's Jean Reynaud's car, right? His ring. And a key. Do you recognize these items? Yes. Be strong, ma'am. He must have fallen asleep at the wheel. He probably never woke up. I hope this will bring you some comfort. Were you aware that your husband had just given his chemical company shares to a woman named Nicole Perrier? Do you know her? I do. She lives in the apartment above ours. But I never cared about Jean's friends. So I won't be able to tell you about the kind of relationship they had. - Not that it matters anymore, of course. - Don't talk like that. He may only have done it for some financial loophole. However, you still own the remaining shares. There's one last formality, Mrs. Reynaud. You must identify the body. The accident left the face heavily disfigured. I can't, inspector. No, I... Please, try to be strong. It's necessary. Follow me. This way. Bring number twenty-two, please. Come on, my dear Danielle, loosen up a bit. Relax. It's all over now. I read the papers. They all say it was a car accident. Afraid the inspector suspects foul play? No, but I had to see the body. An unpleasant, yet unavoidable formality, I'm afraid. The body was totally unrecognizable. A charred, mutilated thing. Oh, Nicole... It was terrifying. Stop thinking about it. What's really important is that you got what you wanted. He's dead and you're rich. He's dead, but you're the rich one. You're the new owner of the whole company. Oh, the shares. It was Jean's idea. He made me sign some papers, but I didn't even realize what they were about. Come on, don't make that face. It doesn't matter who owns them. We're a package deal. Besides, Jean giving me the shares gives you another reason to hate him. But you didn't have to see him like that. My god. Cut it out already. You couldn't stand him anymore, and now he's finally dead. That's what you wanted, right? I wonder who actually wanted it more, you or me. You're already regretting it. It was you who couldn't stand him anymore, who hated even being touched by him. I can't get the image of his body out of my mind. It didn't look human anymore. - It was horrible! - That's enough, Danielle! Think about what I had to do to help you. You remember the first night I was upstairs with him and you were suffering here? Who were you suffering for, Danielle? Me or him? I would still be living with Jean if I hadn't met you. I'd have forced myself to suppress my disgust for him. My morbid obsession. I wouldn't be suffering like this now. I wouldn't have to feel this remorse. It was you. It was you who made me discover who I really am. It would have never happened without you. I understand. It looks like you don't need me anymore. No, Nicole, that's not true. It's now that I need you the most. We're both equally guilty. We have to stay together. Don't worry about the money. We'll split it as agreed. No. It's not about the money. I mean, it's not just about the money. I... You promised you'd stay with me. - Stay here. - Why? To have you constantly bring up the things I did for your sake? You'll end up in jail or a nuthouse if you carry on like this. I don't have any intention of ending up like you. Don't leave me. You're right. You're always right. Besides, it's pointless to feel any remorse. Jean didn't mean anything to us. Forget him. Better yet, try to pretend he never even existed. Let's not spoil the beautiful days ahead of us. You need to enjoy life, Danielle. It's too short, but it can be so good. You're such a dear. I'll never leave you. Answer it, please. It's better. Hello? Yes. You've done well. Alright. Yes, she's right here with me. Alright, we're coming. Stay there. It was Klaus. He's waiting for us at the hotel. - He wants the money. Did you pack it up? - Yes. We'll finally be on our own after we pay him. We'll be free and wealthy. I'm looking for Mr. Klaus. Look here, that pig is screwing two broads at the same time. Is that so? Room eleven. Don't put your shoes on the bed sheets! Let's have her believe we are two prostitutes. Let's go. Klaus? Maybe he went out for a minute. Come in. - Cigarette? - No, thank you. Nicole, that is... That was Jean's. It's pure gold. That idiot Klaus stole it. He doesn't realize we'll all get arrested if someone finds it here. Hang onto it. "You will die too." Nicole! Nicole! Did you really see his body? Answer my question! Yes or no? It was just a body. A charred corpse. How did you identify him? The fabric of his clothes and the ring. This must be Klaus playing with us. It's his way of asking for more money. Quick, let's get out of here. - You done already? - Mr. Klaus wasn't in his room. Weird. I didn't see him leave. Listen, ma'am, could you please give me a physical description of Mr. Klaus? Brown-haired, medium height. Very clean-cut. He wears a wedding ring. He looks clever, like someone who knows what he's doing. Hello? No, my husband has been on a business trip since last week. What? Oh, no... When did it happen? The company warehouse is burning down! Give me a moment, please. Are you crazy? Your building is burning and you keep pretending you've disappeared! Yes. Disappeared. Just at the right time. And I'll also reappear at the right time. You see, Danielle, I didn't tell you yet, but last month I insured the warehouse for exactly three times its value. You see, I didn't disappear without a reason. Jean, don't you realize you're committing fraud? Possibly. You see, a clever man should never have any scruples. "Should never have any scruples..." "Disappeared just at the right time..." "Reappear at the right time..." Come on, Danielle, wake up. Jean... - Jean... - Feeling better, dear? Let's get away from here. Take me away. Wow, she must be in really bad shape to act like that. Oh, give us a break. - Can I help you, miss? - No, she just had a breakdown. Understandable after what happened. Get me a sedative from the pharmacy. Of course, right away. You keep it. I'd better wait upstairs. Klaus will probably call my number. I'm not staying here alone. Alright. I'll sleep with you tonight. Klaus will contact us anyway. We'll just tell him we're not giving him one penny more. After all, what could he do to us? He'd better keep his golden geese happy. I don't know why, but I'm scared. Oh, there's no reason to be scared. I know how to handle Klaus, don't worry about that. Nicole... The handwriting was Jean's. Klaus must have copied it. I told you, stop thinking about that. If Jean were alive, he wouldn't have any reason to stay hidden. Especially from you. Mind if I use these? He was supposed to keep it his whole life. And even in death. Watch out! I killed it. I killed it. I killed it! Nicole? She's a nervous wreck, I don't think she'll last much longer. You got your revenge. She'll die if she sees you again. Yes. Yes. She got suspicious when she saw your cigarette case with the handwriting. It's a fun game to you, huh? It won't be fun for you anymore! Damn you! - It won't be fun anymore! - Let go of me! Did you go nuts all of a sudden? Jean? Jean? Jean? Please... It was only Klaus. He wants his payment doubled. No. You were talking with Jean. Yes, it was Jean! I know the game you're playing. You and Jean are plotting to get rid of me. How did you convince him to give you the company shares? Maybe you told him that I was plotting his murder, even if you were the one that wanted to kill him in the first place. - Danielle, you're talking nonsense. - Don't touch me. I hate you. Very well, then. Yes, I could have done what you're saying. Jean was in love with me. I even considered doing it. But you saw Klaus stabbing him to death, you even saw his body at the morgue. What else do you need to understand that Jean really is dead? All I saw was a knife and a charred corpse. It could have been someone else. His clothes and ring could have been put on anyone! Here. Take these. They'll calm you down a little. Try to be reasonable, Danielle. You know I like you, otherwise I wouldn't have stayed here. I could leave whenever I wish. I'm rich now, who could stop me? Wrong, Nicole. You know well that I'd never allow you to go away. And my grip could become tighter. Or I could just call the police. Why do you have to ruin everything? Did you already have it in mind once we were alone? You're the one playing dirty. If it was really Klaus, why were you speaking like it was Jean? That's just morbid fantasy, you don't know what you're talking about! You're the only one I have, Nicole. Please, don't betray me. How could you think something like that, Danielle? Let's wait a few more days to avoid suspicion, then we can move away from here, just the two of us. We'll take a long vacation. Hello? Yes. Good morning. No, I didn't forget it. I'll be there in a few minutes. Thanks, see you later. Who were you talking to? - Who was it? - My milliner, Elysees 3418. Satisfied? No, that's a lie. Nobody knows you're here. I've had enough with your silly suspicions! I gave her the number myself! You can ask her if you don't believe me! Where are you going? To the boutique. My appointment is at eleven-thirty and I'm already late. - I don't want to be left alone. Don't go. - No! I'm sick and tired of being locked in this apartment listening to your whining! I'm not staying here another minute! I need to get out and breathe some fresh air before I go insane! - But, Nicole... - The world won't end if I leave you alone for a bit! Come on, sit down. Don't be such a baby. Try to rest a bit, or maybe read something. I'll be back in a couple hours. Nicole? Nicole? Where are you? Answer me! Where are you? Open the door! Nicole! Open it! "You will die too..." "You will die too..." Forgive me, Jean! Forgive me! I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore! I just can't. Nobody is answering, ma'am. Maybe she fell asleep. Keep trying until she picks up, please. - Have my luggage brought upstairs. - Certainly. Take care of madam's luggage, quick. Is it you, Danielle? Jean! Jean! Stop this, I beg you! Stop it, please! Just stop it! Hello? Hello? Porter! Hello? Who took the rifle, and why? I can't take this anymore. Stop. Stop. It's not my fault. It was her. I didn't want to. It's all her fault, Jean. It was her, I swear it. Spare me, Jean! Let me go, I beg you! No! Forgive me, Jean! She planned it! I didn't want to do it! I didn't! It's her fault! - Please, please... - Hello? Hello? I hear a woman crying. I don't understand what she's saying. Hello? No! No, Jean, forgive me. Did you hear that? It was a gunshot! There was a woman's voice shouting "Jean!" Jean, she said! Danielle? Danielle, what's happening? Police! We must call the police! My god. Oh, my god. The hotel clerk stated he heard Mrs. Reynaud calling "Jean" before the shot. I imagine this must have been quite a shock for you. You're now the sole owner of Jean Reynaud's assets, correct? I was Jean's mistress. Possibly the only woman who ever made him happy. I'm sorry that his wife killed herself, but I don't have anything to do with it. No, of course you don't. You were on the phone when his wife decided to kill herself. You forget that the hotel clerk was there, too. I can assure you, Mrs. Reynaud didn't hold any grudges against me. Jean's death left her very upset. I sympathized and tried to help her. I even suggested that she move from that apartment with so many memories. I was in that hotel to rent a room for her, when... When Jean came back to murder her. Or maybe somebody else that she mistook for him. Why was she so scared of Jean? You should try acting on TV, instead of playing Sherlock Holmes with me. - Can I go now? - Yes, of course. I wish you good luck, miss. Flight 254 to Rio de Janeiro, departing from lane 35. Last call. - Good morning. - Welcome aboard. Sorry. My wife is sitting here. Thanks, honey. - Everything all right? - Yes. The inspector looked a little doubtful, though. But he doesn't have any proof. I hope so. We're gonna have a fine time with all that money. Let's admit it, dear. We're pretty clever. Well, let's say I'm the truly clever one. I'm not just rich, I also have an alibi. - What are you trying to say? - Stop, you're hurting me. You better learn to be nice to me. Very nice. I'm not just the rich one, I also know you killed two people. Yes. That's him. Be brave, my dear. He'll never stop until he finds a way to frame us. We'll go our separate ways, from now on. Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
