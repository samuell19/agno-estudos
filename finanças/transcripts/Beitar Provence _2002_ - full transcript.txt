A film by: Ori Inbar and Youval Friedman ﻿Schlomi! Military police! ﻿Shlomi, stop! ﻿Stop Shlomi! - Come here! ﻿Good morning, Meir! ﻿Zeev Revach ﻿Shlomi! ﻿The famous Motaleh always used to tell us: ﻿"A respectable performance is halfway to victory.” ﻿Dad, stop asking them to let yoy play. ﻿I want you to leave the team. ﻿But Kasodas wants me on the team, he told me so. ﻿Stop it, Dad. You're embarrassing yourself. -You're wrong. ﻿Kasodas admires my ambitions. ﻿No, he doesn't, he laughs at them. I spoke with them. ﻿They don't know what to do with you. ﻿It's all in your head. ﻿What's there to be embarrassed about? ﻿She's just a girl. ﻿A girl. ﻿You know how... I used to make a pass at a girl? ﻿I'd bring her over to my place, ﻿put on some nice music, a little wine, ﻿a few minutes later I'd say: I'll be right back. ﻿In other words: ’m going for a pee. ﻿Instead of going to the toilet, ﻿I’d go to the electricity box and "ting". -Ting what? ﻿I'd turn off the electricity. Pitch dark. ﻿Then I'd say to her: These power cuts are areal bummer, eh? ﻿And then? -C'mon, we’ve got a game against Ashkelon. ﻿I told you, it's a power cut. Pitch dark, can't see a thing. ﻿What are you gonna do? Play cards? ﻿Fine, be a faggot. ﻿Hurry up, we're late. BEITAR PROVANCE ﻿Shuki, why do you work so hard? ﻿Next time, just shoot him. ﻿A yellow card, I can't believe it... ﻿Yellow, eh? ﻿Shuki! ﻿Ignore him, he's an asshole. ﻿So I talked to Motaleh, who was the coach back then. ﻿Everything was done in style, big-time. ﻿Shlomi! ﻿To the right! Right! ﻿Tell him to go to the right. ﻿Are you blind, you bastard? ﻿“to the national soccer finals Givat Tzurim from League C ﻿"beat Hapoel Ashkelon from the national league, 1:0 ﻿"and made it to the eighth finals. ﻿"The draw will take place tomorrow ﻿"and will be broadcasted live on the Sports Channel." ﻿Meir, how's it going? ﻿What’s going on? I have the draw tomorrow. I want to rest. ﻿I want to change agents. ﻿I heard that Rivaldo's agent “ takes low commissions. ﻿I'll look into it for you. - I'm serious. ﻿I got the number of some agent in Tel Aviv who has connections with Maccabi. You're a big boy, do as you see fit. "Do as I see fit?" Be offended, Kasodas. ﻿Argue with me, fight for me ﻿Where are all your promises, like "I'll make a star out of you"? ﻿How can I find you a team if you don't listen? ﻿Me and Shalom kept telling you to go to the right. ﻿But you do whatever you want. ﻿Who assisted Shuki today? ﻿I don't have time to sit here and polish your ego. I ﻿gave you my word. ﻿Talk less, score more. I gave you my word. ﻿Enough talking. Go set up the barrels. ﻿We're back with Moni Meshiach and the local news magazine. ﻿Shabi, you had a lot to lose. ﻿How could you leave everything and return to the south? ﻿Although I had a good job. I dedn't feel like I belong. People said "Shabi, lighten up." but I was an outsider. ﻿How does it feel to be back? ﻿Not bad. This is my home. Here I'm Shabi. "This is my home, here I'm Shabi," says Shabi Uzan. ﻿That's a lot to think about at this time of night.. C'mon! ﻿Over there. ﻿What's that? ﻿An alarm. -Do you have one on the toaster too? ﻿You think l enjoy having my TV stolen every week? ﻿What’s so funny? ﻿I didn't see you coming. ﻿How are you, Hava? ﻿Fine, everything's fine. How are you? ﻿Great. I'm great too. ﻿I'm 26 and living with my mother, great. ﻿I started working for Kasodas. - I heard. That's great. ﻿I feel like I'm really changing. You wouldn't recognize me. ﻿I bought Aki some goalie gloves. - Great. ﻿Byren's goalie wears the same kind. ﻿No one will score any more goals against Aki Daloya. ﻿I'll come by tonight to give them to him. -You can't. ﻿I'll just give them to him, then I'll leave. ﻿You won't even notice I was there. ﻿Give them to him when he comes to see you. ﻿I'll give them to him day after tomorrow. ﻿We're'back at the draw ﻿for the 8th finals of the national soccer cup finals. ﻿In just a few minutes we'll-know who’ll be playing who. ﻿During this stage, we usually see teams ﻿That we don't exactly read about on the daily sports section. ﻿The competing teams sent their representatives, ﻿Here's Yankaleh Shachar. Maccabi Haifa, as always, ﻿is a likely team to win the cup, Yankaleh. ﻿I heard you just signed an outstanding new Czech striker. ﻿Knock it off, what do you take me for? A broad? ﻿Why did they send kasodas to the draw Instead of me? ﻿Hey, the guy once had one of the best restaurants in Tel Aviv. ﻿One day a friend said to him: "Shabtai, ﻿"Are you going to sit here your entire life and drink arak? ﻿"If you're smart, you'll go into the hotel business, ﻿"Tons of tourists will come .. To Israel for the year 2000." ﻿It's Story Time with Yehuda Alush. ﻿Knock it off. He sold his restaurant, ﻿Took all of his savings and put it all into the hotel. ﻿Erez, you majored in electronics, didn't you? ﻿Knock it off. Can't you see I'm trying? ﻿And new, the team to has been a big surprise so far, ﻿Beitar Givat Tzurim. Here's the team's manager, Shabtai. ﻿I'm sorry, but I don't even know where Givat Tzurim is. ﻿It's a smalt town with a population of 8,000. ﻿He's more photogenic than in real life. -Shut up. ﻿It's a young team... Who would you like to draw? ﻿Well welcome any team that comes to the south like kings, ﻿But we're an ambitious team without an inferiority complex. ﻿You're optimistic for someone in League C. Yes, but I have a motto in life, Danny. ﻿I believe that only someone who has balls can break them. ﻿OK, good luck. It's time for the draw, but first, ﻿let's see what's waiting for us this week on the Sports Channel. ﻿Damn commercials. - Where are you going? -I have to pee. ﻿Sorry. -Are you OK? - Yes, fine. ﻿Felix Bordo. Manager of Hapoel Acre. ﻿Kasodas. Yes, I saw you earlier. ﻿I heard good thongs about your place. ﻿Tzurim? -Givat Tzurim. - Givat... yes. ﻿Aren't you confusing us with some place else? ﻿I heard you have a great striker ﻿Who scored 32 goals from the beginning of the season. ﻿34. He's outstanding. ﻿Without further ado, let's see which team will be first. ﻿Beitar Givat Tzurim, the Cinderella. Shabtai, would you join us? ﻿Feeling pressure? - No, I'm fine. ﻿Let's see what the draw has in store for you. ﻿Who will be going all the way to Givat Tzurim? ﻿Maccabi, Maccabi, Maccabi... ﻿What did you do? ﻿I've been working on this for an hour! -And you get... ﻿Yes! ﻿Maccabi Tel Aviv, at home! ﻿Kasodas, I see that... Hey, are you at loss for words? ﻿Here's the representative of Maccabi Tel Aviv, Mr. Shimon Sudri. Hi, Shimon. -Hi. - Everything comes full circle. ﻿Can you believe it'? Me and Tal Banin running for the same ball. ﻿And he gets there first. ﻿I'm not afraid of him, he's nothing but a show-off. -Whoa! ﻿A round of beers on Yaakobi, ﻿who's not afraid of Tal Banin. ﻿Shimon, Shimon. - What? ﻿Don't you recognize me? No, remind me. ﻿You really don't recognize me. ﻿You promissed never to forget me when I was injured playing for Maccabi. ﻿Shabtai... ﻿Kasodas. - Shabtai Kasodas. ﻿I'm sorry. I... How are you? -Fine. ﻿This team is a full-time job, eh? It's a lot of work. Have a hotel in town too. ﻿Grea, great. It was great seeing you ﻿Here. ﻿We'll be in touch, eh? Good luck. -Thanks. ﻿He's such a loser. Can't stand him. ﻿What's up? ﻿Why aren't they practicing? ﻿I'm giving them a theoretical practice, ﻿Showing them Maccabi, to study. ﻿Oh, a theoretical practice. ﻿We're a League C team, Shabtai, that's all there is to it. ﻿Shalom, they have to practice, to run. ﻿We need good players, Shabtai. ﻿I heard there's a cheap Brazilian mid-felder in Israel ﻿Who played in Vasco de Gamma and in Europe. -And? ﻿He's looking for a small team in Israel, to finalize his career. ﻿Without a reinforcement player, wo can kiss this game goodbye. We don't have a chance of scoring a single goal. ﻿A goal? ﻿What good will a goal do me? -What a goal! ﻿Here. Sezar. ﻿At the moment he plays for Kfar Saba, but he is on a loan in Acre. ﻿I know the manager in Acre. ﻿A Brazilian player in Givat Tzurim. ﻿In the end I'll believe in all your stupid dreams. I'd chop off my nose just to see Sudri's face after they lose. ﻿Give me the ball. Come on. Hi, Moti. How are you? - Fine. -Cool. ﻿There's a smell here that I'm not used to. ﻿Cactus fruit? - No, I'm used to that. ﻿Lavender. How did you know? ﻿Just a wild guess. - Really? ﻿It's my cologne. ﻿That's my favorite smell. - No kidding? ﻿Did you ever smell real lavender? ﻿Then come over to my place... - Say what? I mean... I have some lavender at home, you could smell it. ﻿I'll think about it. ﻿Is Mom at home? - No. ﻿She left you alone? - I'm a big boy now. -Yeah. ﻿The biggest. ﻿What’s that behind your back? - Nothing. ﻿They're yours. ﻿Should I tell Fadida you're replacing him in the game? ﻿Let's go inside. ﻿No, it's better out here. ﻿Hello to you too. ﻿Did you say thank you? - Of course. -Of course. ﻿Will you spend some time with us? ﻿Another time. ﻿OK, see you later. ﻿Lift those legs up! ﻿Start running like men, not girls. ﻿Lay it into him. Here, Fadida. ﻿What's up? - What is this mess? ﻿It's Hanukah vacation. Mothers went on a recreation day. ﻿A recreation day? ﻿See that kid? - Yeah. ﻿That's Herman's kid, the one behind him is Fadida's. ﻿I don't give a damn about Herman's kid! ﻿Here. - What is it? ﻿A tape of Mario Sezar de Olivera. - Who's that? -Sezar! ﻿Are you serious, Shabtai? ﻿Where will you get the money? You're broke. ﻿It's not every day that you play against Maccabi, Shalom. ﻿Sezar is number 11? - Yes. ﻿There's a dead one on the bottom, he's not moving. ﻿He's sleeping. ﻿Are you kidding me? ﻿said he's sleeping. ﻿Shalom, have you ever heard of a sleeping fish? ﻿When fish get tired, they sleep. ﻿Tired of what? Swimming all day? ﻿Give me a break. - Would you knock it off? ﻿If Sezar is still in shape, he can assist Shiomi ﻿to score against Maccabi, they won't know what hit them. -For sure ﻿Shabtai, what did you need that Brazilian for? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Show me something he does that I can't. I can assist Shiomi. ﻿Why dod you brimf Him here? Resuscitate the fish and shut up! ﻿Shalom, I want to ask you something. -Shoot. ﻿Do you have an announcer for the game? ﻿It could add a lot of pizzazz to an important event like this. ﻿Check it out: "Number 7, Tal Banin!" What do you think? ﻿Ask Kasodas, Moni, I don’t get involved in these things. ﻿At the army's committee. No. Einat has a friend here, she'll let me in. ﻿I don't know. OK, bye. ﻿Hey, aren't you Maccabi's goalie? ﻿Have you ever been in there? ﻿It's my 5th time. This'time, I won't give in. I ﻿come all the way from the south. ﻿3 hours each direction, I come here, ﻿And they tell me to go back to the base. ﻿They sent MP's after me last time because I didn't go back. ﻿But hey, I'm in great shape. ﻿I made them chase after me all over the desert. ﻿Which team did you say? - Givat Tzurim. ﻿We're playing against you, remember? ﻿No, we got some team from League C or something. ﻿That's us. ﻿Are you kidding me? - Why? ﻿You actually think a League C player will be awarded ﻿Outstanding athlete by the army? Are you serious? ﻿Why not? ﻿- Nimni: Cinderella is only in the fairytales - ﻿Hi. -Hi. - How are you?—Alright. ﻿This is Sezar. - Kasodas. ﻿I understand you're interested in Sezar. I need him on a loan for two weeks. -Two weeks? ﻿I only need him for the cup game. ﻿Then you can have him back. ﻿I hope you don’t mind me asking, ﻿But how can a team like yours afford a player like Sezar? ﻿This is where I want your help. I can't afford him. ﻿What do you take me for, a chump? -No, Felix. All I'm asking for is a little help for a little team. ﻿Felix, I can't pay you in money for this favor. ﻿I have a hotel, you can bring your family. ﻿The weather's beautiful in the desert. Come for the weekend. ﻿With the whole family for the weekend. Great. ﻿Is there a swimming pool? ﻿Yes, there's a pool. I'll give you massages. ﻿Kasodas, you're amazing. ﻿I don't know how you managed to stir my heart. ﻿But as soon as the recess is over, ﻿He starts playing in Kfar Saba, so I need him healthy. ﻿I'll return him like I got him. ﻿Listen, Kasodas, I've seen League C games, ﻿League C players, League C fields, so... ﻿Felix I'll return him just like I got him. ﻿Hezi Shlomi? Is your last name Hezi or Shlomi? -Hezi. ﻿Kasodas, do you really think you can beat Maccabi Tel Aviv? ﻿Sudri underestimates me. ﻿He's saving his stars for Europe and sending me his junior team. ﻿And I’m telling you, my nose says that we're going to beat them. ﻿Good luck. - Good luck. ﻿That's disgusting. You're a jerk, you know? -Hey, Sezar. ﻿Good luck against Maccabi. - Thanks. ﻿Felix, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. -Don't mention it. What do you know? Don't give that crap! You know what? I've had it! ﻿Soldier! ﻿Calm down, solider, now! ﻿Good Sabbath. ﻿What are you doing here? - Please, I'm asking you... ﻿Shuki, you aren't allowed to be here. ﻿Be nice to me, help me change, Hava. ﻿Good Sabbath, Hava. -Good Sabbath. How are you? -Good Sabbath/ ﻿How's Michal? - Fine, thanks. ﻿Put some snacks out for the guys. ﻿Thanks, Hava. - You're welcome. ﻿Hava, where's the Arsenal tape? I can't find it. ﻿You're back together? ﻿Who's back together? ﻿You and Shuki. That's what he's been saying. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Let's go, Shuki. ﻿She threw the tapes away. Wait outside, we'll go to my place. ﻿See you, Hava. - Good Sabbath. ﻿She threw them all away. ﻿Let's go home. ﻿Let's go, we're disturbing her. - You're hurting me. ﻿The Brazilian. ﻿What can he do that I can't do? ﻿They bring this Gentile, one day he works for them, ﻿the next day he works for someone else. ﻿Even Motaleh used to tell us: ﻿"The club's players are the soul of the team." ﻿When Motaleh comes, tell him to fill up the salt shakers. ﻿“The great Maccabi Tei Aviv vs. The surprising Beitar Givat Tzurim" ﻿How's the Brazilian? - Fine. ﻿He's not in form, but he's a winner. ﻿What a great team, eh? - Yeah, just like in Brazil. You each get one. Go, go. Take him. ﻿What are you doing? You each take one. Stay with him. ﻿Way to go, Shlomi. ﻿It's a practice game, Shabtai. Yoo won't let me play? ﻿A practice game isn't a game? ﻿Shlomi, to the right. Don't let him get by. -Take him. ﻿Shlomi... Their defense sucks. ﻿Isn't that guy from Maccabi? ﻿Forget about that. ﻿C'mon, guys. Up, up. ﻿To the right, right. ﻿Shimon. ﻿That kid of yours is pretty good. I'm not selling him to Maccabi. - Just to try out. -No way. ﻿Forget about him. See you at the game. ﻿Everything OK? - Of course. ﻿The "Southern Diamond" just scored 4 goals. ﻿Who aren't you selling to Maccabi? - What are you talking about? ﻿I saw Shimon Sudri drooling over me. ﻿That doesn't matter. - I want to try out for Maccabi ﻿No way. You promised to look after me. ﻿Maccabi isn't a good place for you. - How do you know? ﻿They'll use you and then throw you to the dogs. Believe me. I've always wanted to play for Maccabi Tel Aviv. ﻿Want me to be stuck here with the cactus for the rest of my life? ﻿You know what? Fine. ﻿But I'm not playing in this game. ﻿Are you giving me the silent treatment? I'm talking to you -Leave me alone. ﻿Shlomi, all I care about is your wellbeing. ﻿Who will look after you there? ﻿Think about your mother, your late father. ﻿I promised him I'd take care of you. ﻿If my father were alive, I'd already be playing for Maccabi. ﻿That's not fair. - You're the one who started. ﻿You're so hard-headed. I've never met anyone as stubborn as you. like a mule. ﻿"What I dreamt of ﻿"What I fought for ﻿"What everyone says ﻿"But this time I won't buy the lies ﻿"I climbed up ﻿"I fell down ﻿"It's a temporary fall "Because this time it won't happen again..." ﻿How's it going, Sudri? - Shabtai. I want you to come to Tel Aviv to talk. -About what? ﻿What do you think? - Sudri, you listen to me. ﻿You can forget about him. ﻿Shlomi Hezi will never play for maccabi ﻿I'm asking you nicely, stay away from him. ﻿Come in. Shimon Sudri called last night. ﻿In one lousy game I did more defense than in my entire life. ﻿Don't take it to heart, Shlomi. ﻿Who needs Maccabi anyway? ﻿There are plenty of tams that know what real soccer is. ﻿"Restore my House of Prayer ﻿"And there we will bring a thanksgiving offering..." ﻿What's up? - Happy Hanukah. ﻿What are you doing here? - Enjoying the breeze. Do you have to do it outside Hava's house? ﻿Come on. I'll give you a ride. ﻿Moti, what are you doing? Leave it. ﻿It's OK. - Leave it. ﻿The Brazilian is nice -Yeah. ﻿Should I get the donuts? - Here they are. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You mustn’t use Hanukah candles as a source of light. Did you cause this power cut? ﻿What's the matter? Never been in a power cut before? ﻿The whole town. Ouch. -Sorry. -It's OK. - Sorry. Is that your volley foot? ﻿We have this joke on the team, ﻿When someone's foot is injured, We say "At least it's not your volley foot." ﻿it's a team joke. ﻿So what do we do? - What do we do? ﻿Whose hands are these? - I dont know. ﻿Hello. ﻿Hello. ﻿Aki, slide, love. I'm sorry, Hava. I feel kind of weird. ﻿Me too. really, me too. ﻿Wanna come over to my place tonight? ﻿I don't have a babysitter for tonight, howhow abiut tommorrow? ﻿Where's Shlomi? - He's not here yet. ﻿Look at that. ﻿Close in, Yaron. ﻿What happened? ﻿What happened? ﻿Get me some spray. Spray, damn it. ﻿Lift him up! ﻿Thanks, Shuki. Thanks a lot. Great. ﻿At least apologize. Say you didn't mean it. ﻿He's messing around with Hava. ﻿Hava lit Hanukah candles with Aki last night. Sezar was there too. ﻿She probably wanted to show him what Hanukah is. ﻿I wonder what else she showed him. ﻿Let him walk by himself. ﻿What am I gonna do? ﻿You know what bums me out the most? ﻿That she looked happy again. ﻿I looked at her through the window, it was the first time in a long time that she looked happy. I'm teling you, no one'fucks Kasodas over. ﻿Tell him to take off his shirt. ﻿Shabtai, it’s not his fault. - Then whose fault is it? Huh? ﻿Whose tendon is torn? Huh? My sister's? ﻿Is it his fault that Shuki laid into him? C'mon. ﻿I was counting on him And you persuaded me. ﻿Why did you bring him here? Why? ﻿I knew this would happen. I knew it! ﻿Every time it's the same thing, ﻿I go against my intuition and get screwed up the ass ﻿Felix, I’ll make it up to you. It’ll be OK. Don't worry. ﻿You shut up. "Don't worry." I've had it. ﻿Ever since I came to this country I’ve heard the same thing. "It'll be OK, don't worry." ﻿who took care of me when I was injured. he's a fabulous doctor. ﻿I don't care about you. ﻿All I care about is the $100,000 security J paid for him. ﻿What $100,000 are you talking about? ﻿Give me the $100,000. Give me the money now. ﻿Otherwise I'll have this place burned down to the ground. ﻿Tell me what you want and I'll make it up to you, Felix. ﻿Give me your kid. What kid? -Shlomi. ﻿What are looking at? - I can't give you Shlomi. ﻿I promised him. You promised me too ﻿Stop making promises to everyone ﻿Now go tell Shlomi to pack his bags. ﻿He's going to Acre with me. Go. ﻿Go. ﻿Let me keep him until after the game against Maccabi. ﻿Then he's yours. ﻿Bring him to Acre tomorrow for medical examinations. ﻿If he's OK, you'll get him for the game. ﻿Bend over. ﻿I gave my word to Kasodas that I'd do my best ﻿to make you feel like a club player. ﻿As if you grew up here in Acre. just to fill good... ﻿#10! Hapoel Acre. ﻿Kasodas, ask about... ﻿Shlomi wants to know... We want to know ﻿if Hapoel Acre can get him released from the army, ﻿As an outstanding athlete. ﻿Sure. No problem. ﻿How about the head of the Northern Command? ﻿What’s so funny? - Sorry. ﻿Outstanding athelete. ﻿You couldn't wait, eh? ﻿What's wrong? You usually eat them with the carton ﻿Never mind, Yehuda. Your money is on the table Good night. ﻿What's going on, Shabtai? What are you scheming? -Would you shut up? ﻿I gave Shlomi to Hapoel Acre. - You gave Shlomi to Hapoel Acre? ﻿They'll ruin him. -I had no choice. It was either or the hotel. ﻿You're cruel, Shabtai. ﻿You need money? Forget about your pride. Sell him to Maccabi. ﻿Shimon. -Shabtai. - How are you? -great. ﻿And you? - Fine. ﻿I had a feeling I'd hear from you again. ﻿What happened? - You know... ﻿We didn't discuss Shlomi sriously. I'll tell you the truth, I didn't expect anything. ﻿He has a defense problem. He's small. ﻿He needs strengthening. But that's not a problem. ﻿It can be solved by hard work. Like I said, Shlomi played well. ﻿How much will you pay me for him? - Name your price. ﻿$100,000. ﻿What's so funny? - I thought we were talking business. ﻿I was injured and hospitalized the day this picture was taken. ﻿What a team we had back then, eh? ﻿Shimon, forget the nostalgia. How much will you pay? ﻿There's a price we pay for players ﻿to whom we give a chance to play for us. ﻿Spare me the song and dance. How much? ﻿$20,000. ﻿$20,000? ﻿Do you take me for a fool? — -God forbid. That's the price we pay. ﻿$20,000? ﻿That's peanuts. ﻿Want something to drink? - Water. ﻿What are we going to do, Moti? ﻿They say that time heals everything. So does distance ﻿What do you dream of? ﻿Not much. ﻿Shlomi dreams of being a star in tel Aviv. ﻿Yehuda dreams of Maccabi Netanya. - What do you dream of? -Me? I always wanted to work as a guide and save money to go away. To live on the purple horizon. ﻿Smell this. ﻿Lavender. I've always had a dream ﻿To build a farm with sheep and rabbits in Provence. ﻿In spring in Provence, you can see endless fields ﻿Of amazing flowers. All the colors of the rainbow. ﻿Rows of lavender till eye can see. ﻿It looks like the entire horizon is painted purple. ﻿Will you go there? - Will you come with me? ﻿Did i wake you? - Sort of. ﻿I'm sick of my mother. I fought with her again. ﻿I can't live there anymore. ﻿We'll end up shooting each other. ﻿Everything OK? - Grat, everything's great. Can I... - What? Sleep over tonight? - No, tonight isn't good for me. Is something wrong? - No, no, everything's fine. ﻿Shiomi! Military police! - Fuck. ﻿How many times do you think I'll let you off the hook? We didn't forgot the last time you went AWOL. ﻿Look who's talking. Shlomo Kaminker, the loser who wasn't promoted ﻿Due to inappropriate conduct. - Shlomi. ﻿That sexual harasser is preaching me? Give me a break. ﻿Shlomi. -Am I lying? Tell me if I'm lying. ﻿Listen closely. I'm sick of you ﻿And all the calls from your mother after you've been punished. ﻿You can't talk to your company commander like that. ﻿14 days in the slammer. ﻿Give it to him. ﻿Arsenal. ﻿It's an original, from England. Where aid you get it? ﻿Listen to me, Shiomi. The game is on Saturday. ﻿I don't have time for any crap. ﻿Agassi said that if you apologize to your commander ﻿He'll let you out for the game. ﻿Don't be an idiot, Shlomi. It's for your own good. ﻿All Agassi is asking of you is to say you’re sorry. ﻿Just say you're sorry ”S©[fT/o O(ni© wi ﻿Think about Sudri. We came to him from the south after training, running, Sweating, begging, and he didn't want us. ﻿I've had one dream ever since. ﻿For him to see you on the field and to bang his head against the wall And then to see his goalie taking the ball out of the net. One goal. ﻿One, for me. ﻿Listen, Kasodas, thanks for the tape and all. ﻿But I'm not apologizing. ﻿Because of this nonsense you won't play against Maccabi. ﻿No, I won't. ﻿Since I've been here... I've had a lot of time to think. I tried to understand... why I love soccer so much. ﻿Some people do math problems, some act in movies ﻿I know how to score goals. ﻿It's what I do best, it's what makes me feel good. ﻿If I'm really that good, why doesn't the army release me? ﻿Why doesn't Sudri want me to play for him? ﻿So if the only place I can play soccer ﻿Is in Givat tzurim or with Felix and his bastard doctor, ﻿Then I've had it. ﻿It's no fun anymore, I don't want to play. C'mon Shlomi. He asked nicely. Apologize and get it over with. ﻿Let's go. ﻿What happened? - I'm leaving, Hava. ﻿But first tell me what happened. ﻿I flipped over with the forklift. - Are you OK? ﻿I'm fine. The forklift is totaled. ﻿Meir said he'd deduct the repair fee from my wages. -Son of a bitch. ﻿When I came to work here I told Meir that I could be a tour guide, ﻿That I didn't want to work with any machinery. ﻿That's it, Hava, this time it's the real thing. ﻿But Meir isn't everything. You have plenty of other things here. ﻿I'm not leaving here, I'm going there. ﻿There isn't any cactus fruit there? - There aren't any prickles. ﻿You didn't give me an answer. - About what? ﻿Come with me to Provence, Hava. ﻿Moti, I have a kid, a job and a life ﻿And you want me to leave everything for some lavender? ﻿Look how far you got with your dreams. ﻿If it wasn't for your dreams, you'd still be stuck with... ﻿And I thought you were his friend. ﻿How’s Mommy? - Fine. ﻿She doesn't talk about me or say anything? ﻿Nothing. -Nothing? Not even bad things? -Nothing. To the side... Always block to the side. ﻿And if she does say something, will you tell me? -Why not? ﻿Tell me one more thing. Do you'have visitors? -Who? ﻿Do friends come over to see Mommy? -No. ﻿No one? - Sometimes Sarit comes to visit ﻿And baby-sits me and that's it. ﻿Oh, and Sezar came over and so did Moti. ﻿Moti? What was he doing there? We lit candles and sang songs. ﻿-And what happened? ﻿C'mon kick. - Did he sleep over? ﻿Yes or no? No. I think he did. ﻿Then he grabs me, his eyes were like this. ﻿He begged me: "Shiomi, please, just say you're sorry. Apologize." Then he starts in. "You have to score a goal against Maccabi." ﻿So what's the big deal? Apologize. ﻿You can't believe in anyone. People are shitty, that's what he says. ﻿Why does scoring a goal against Maccabi mean so much to him? ﻿He's nuts. Then I told him I'm not playing soccer anymore. ﻿That devastated him. He was on the verge of tears. ﻿What's there to cry about? -He only played two games with Maccabi. ﻿Kasodas played for Maccabi Tel Aviv? ﻿Yes, and a player he was. ﻿He had an amazing left kick. His penalty kicks were the greatest. ﻿They said he was Maccabi's future striker. ﻿Yeah, right. -This is for real, Sarit. -Go on, go on. ﻿He tore a tendon in a practice game. ﻿Maccabi knew about it. But Shimon Sudri told him to play. ﻿That they'd replace him if he felt any pain. ﻿By the time the game was over, his leg was like this. ﻿I bet he couldn't play for a month. -A month? ﻿They had him play the next day. ﻿That evening he was in the operating room. ﻿That's it, his career was over. ﻿He never heard from them again. ﻿They didn't even give him season tickets. ﻿Fadida. What are you doing here? ﻿Just passing by. ﻿Did Hava call to complain about me? - We're supposed to arrest you. ﻿Are you an idiot? ﻿Do you want to sit in jail tomorrow instead of playing? ﻿What's with you, Fadida? You're like a brother to me. I love you. ﻿You don't understand, do you? ﻿You're on probation, they'll lock you up. Do you understand that? ﻿Tzion, leave me alone with him. What’s with you? ﻿He said leave. - Shut up. The gun is in your pocket isn't worth shit. ﻿Fuck you, you bastard. - Why do you do this to yourself? ﻿It's OK, I'll take him to my place. ﻿Leave the handcuffs on me, or else I'll file a complaint. ﻿Take me down to the station. - What's your problem? ﻿Don't listen to him. Stop it, Shuki. Go to sleep, we have the game tomorrow. ﻿Tziyon, let him go. ﻿Leave him. Moti, be careful. ﻿Hi, Rafi. ﻿Players... What can you do? ﻿What's it going to be? ﻿I'm getting used to seeing my players in the slammer. ﻿What happened? ﻿He thinks he's Claude Van Damme. ﻿He head-butted Tziyon the goon. "Welcome to hell" ﻿That's it, that's it. ﻿That's good. Great. ﻿Let's practice One-on-one defense. ﻿We'll do it like this. Moti, you be the Hungarian. Shuki will take you. ﻿Herman, stop playing with the ball. ﻿Shushan, you take Tal Banin. Erez, you'll be Tal Banin. ﻿I refuse to be Tal Banin. - What did you say? ﻿I refuse to be Tai Banin. ﻿Herman, you take... - Let Herman be Tal Banin. ﻿I won't be Tal Banin. I don't do players that I hate. ﻿Erez, you're Tal Banin, that's it. - Then I'm going home. ﻿No one's going home. ﻿Whoa! ﻿We thought we'd have to beat Maccabi all by ourselves. ﻿Hey, bro. ﻿It's no big deal. I said sonry. One word ﻿Go get dressed. ﻿Why aren't you on the field with us? - Are they here? ﻿Don't you think it's strange that I agreed to apologize? ﻿I bet you thought I was just another ungrateful bastard. But I know how hard you worked to get me out. ﻿I see how much effort you put in me, in the team, ﻿How much this game means to you ﻿Yehuda told me everything. ﻿I know about Sudri, your injury, everything. ﻿So if I don't score at least one goal, ﻿My name isn't "The Southern Diamond". ﻿Where's our star? ﻿Welcome to the 8th finals of the national cup ﻿Between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Beitar Givat Tzurim. ﻿I'd like to invite the players of both teams to come onto the field. ﻿But first, the Cinderella from the South, Beitar Givat Tzurim. ﻿Here they are. And now our guests, Maccabi Tel Aviv. ﻿Give them a warm round of applause. ﻿Good Sabbath and welcome to Givat Tzurim. ﻿Maccabi Tel Aviv versus Beitar Givat Tzurim. ﻿Here's our commentator, Motaleh Schpigler. ﻿I can't believe it. Beitar Givat Tzurim vs. Maccabi Tel Aviv. ﻿Believe it. ﻿What a great game we're about to see. ﻿Hello, Tal. I'm a stopper, my name is Erez Yaakobi. ﻿Good luck. - Thanks. ﻿I shook Banin's hand! ﻿This is Maccabi Tel Aviv's chance. Ben Dayan kicks... And it's in! 1:0 for Maccabi Tel Aviv. ﻿Dedi Ben Dayan scored that goal. ﻿Don't worry, we'll get even with them. ﻿Keep on cheering! I can't hear you! ﻿Pass to Erez. ﻿Kobi, up. Close in on him. ﻿Go on. ﻿Take him, take him, take him. ﻿And now Rodrigo Goldberg bursts forth, kicks the ball, ﻿the ball hits the goal post and bounces away. ﻿That's 2:0. ﻿Never mind. ﻿The ball is heading in Tal Banin’s direction. - ﻿Banin jumps up, strikes a header, and it's in 3:0 ﻿Beautiful. Reminds me of the way I play. ﻿What's the score? ﻿3:0. This wouldn't happen in Netanya. ﻿The first haif is over. Maccabi is in the lead, 3:0. ﻿Banin, Ben Dayar and Dego scored the goals. Motaleh, your summary. ﻿I'd go onto the field while Maccabi is in the dressing rooms, ﻿Score 3 goals against nobody and create a surprise. ﻿OK, listen up. ﻿We played alright so far. We're playing strong. ﻿I'm pleased. I know you're tired. ﻿That's why I'm going to make a slight change in tactics. ﻿Fadida is about to pass out any minute. ﻿So from now on everyone except Shlomi is on defense. ﻿Every ball you get, boom, paa it over to Shlomi ﻿Is that clear? Do the best you can. Good luck. ﻿The second half is starting. ﻿Cheer them on. It's not over yet. ﻿Hey, referee! Foul! ﻿That's a penalty kick for us, Givat Tzurim! ﻿He kicks very well, he can control the ball, they all can. Maccabi Tel Aviv better be careful. ﻿They're doing very well, ﻿Let's not forget the differences in the leagues. ﻿If he kicks like Revive that's good, ﻿if he kicks like Zidane, that's good too... He's running towards the ball, and he kicks. ﻿What a save by naor Mizrachi. ﻿Hezi's kick was good, but what can you do... ﻿There's a corner kick now. ﻿Put him in. - Get dressed. C'mon! ﻿It's the 90th minute. 3:0 for Maccabi Tel Aviv. ﻿Beitar Givat Tzurim is making changes. ﻿C'mon, killer. Show them who Yehuda Alush is. Number 3 Erez Yaakobi is replaced by number 99. ﻿Yehuda Alush! ﻿I think one of the players brought his grandpa. ﻿Yehuda Alush, he's going in to play. ﻿That name rings a bell. Let's see what he can do. ﻿He doesn't have much time left to play, ﻿But Maccabi just lost the ball in mid-field. Alush has the ball. He has good control, ﻿He reminds me of one of the great players of the past... ﻿He's an excellent soccer player. ﻿Beitar Givat Tzurim isn't breathing. ﻿Here comes Shiomi Hezi's kick. ﻿And the ball goes in! ﻿Lucky for Maccabi that Alush played for only 60 seconds. ﻿But it was worth coming all the way ﻿Here to see that performance, that phenomenon go by as if... ﻿He was ignoring them. ﻿He reminds me of someone. My God, what an amazing player. - ﻿Unbelievable. And that's the end of the game. 3:1 for Maccabi Tel Aviv, ﻿But the most amazing memory from this game is Yehuda Alush. ﻿Great. Well done. ﻿Get him ready, we have a long drive ahead of us. ﻿Take the keys. - What is this? ﻿It's a good hotel. ﻿This is for the lobby, this is for my suite. ﻿I'll come later to get my mother's picture from the lobby. ﻿Thanks, Felix. ﻿Maccabi's jersey looks good on you. ﻿Sudri, look after him for me. ﻿Your auusome! ﻿Come with us to the dressing room. - In a minute. ﻿There's so much sand on this field. ﻿Go on, go on. ﻿What I dreamt of ﻿What I fought for ﻿What everyone says ﻿But this time I won't buy the lies ﻿I climbed up ﻿I fell down ﻿It's a temporary fall ﻿Because this time it won't happen again ﻿It's a promise for success And now it's your turn ﻿"My hava, it's better than a dream.
