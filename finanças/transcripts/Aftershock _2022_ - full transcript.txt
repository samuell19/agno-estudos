I just wanted to illustrate how over-the-top my daughter is in every aspect of her life. Shamony's hyper. She's crazy. She does everything with force. She's loud. She brushes her teeth like the teeth did something to her. Bed-Stuy do or die. So we got to run. Oh lord. I don't need to warm up. I got this. I got this. Why you laughing? Woo! This crazy man got me running too much. How does it feel for me to be moving out? - Uh, okay. Okay! Same day, different apartment. I'm making a list. I told Shamony to make 20 lists before. - The thing is that both Omari and I have pregnancy brain, right, O? - Yeah, we do. It's clearly you. Oh goodness. So your baby going to be Moses Maynard Gibson? No. No. No, I'm kidding. Moses Maynard? No. - Say hi. Hey, baby. Time is flying. Four months already. Every day is a new process. You wake up like, "Oh my god, I'm that much closer to being a mom again." - Hi, sweet baby. So I am... What? I can't say sweet baby? Who're you talking to? - I'm talking to Khari. Oh. - So, um... Yes, my plan was to have you at home, so maybe your auntie will record. And I can still have you at home. We have three hours from now. But, however, it doesn't always work, right? So if you were born tomorrow... It's been four months and three days since she passed away. You know, it feels like it was last week. - Greetings, family. I didn't know all of this beautifulness was behind me. I'm so blown away and so appreciative and so humbled by your presence. So, um, this is my daughter's birthday. She would've been 31 years old today, and she loved to plan things and to party, so we're having this celebration on her behalf. This is a celebration of life, but also it's about how Shamony has been speaking to all of us in our family and extended community since she passed. About an hour ago, I started to, to falter. Um, and I won't even call it falter. I'm just experiencing my grief, you know. Alright, so how you want us to line up, cousin? Um, family first? Can I get family, age order please? It's a struggle every day, particularly because what happened with Shamony was absolutely preventable. She ended up with a C-section. My baby. My baby that I've been waiting forever for. You did amazing, Shamony. So we leave the hospital. Within the first week, she was complaining about having shortness of breath when she talked. She walked down the stairs to get something. And when she was trying to get back up, she couldn't move. Like, she was just, she had to just lay on the floor for a while. We called the hospital, telled them what the symptoms were. The doctor said, you know, "It's okay. Just relax." That proceeded for the next two weeks. We go back to the hospital for, um, Shamony so that they could remove her staples from her C-section. I was again telling them what the symptoms were. Asking them what are some things that we can do. And, you know, the answer pretty much was the same every time. "Just makes sure that she rests." There wasn't much of a sense of urgency on their part at all. That's the expert, and I'm not a doctor, so okay. I rallied people to make meals for her. I did what we do! Just take care of her. Two weeks after, you know, she gave birth, Shamony was complaining that she had really sharp chest pains. She says, "I want to go to the hospital now." Her mom and her aunt were in the back with her. And as I'm packing the bag, I just hear them screaming and screaming, "Omari, Omari, come in here. Come in here." So I run in there, and then I just see Shamony is, she's just in shock. The ambulance came. It seems like forever, but it was only minutes. And I immediately started talking to them about what was happening. Like, "She just had a C-section." I'm telling them the symptoms. - You know, they kept asking me, they kept asking her mother, "Is she on any drugs or anything like that? Was she taking any drugs?" Like, "No, she doesn't take drugs." - Next set of people come in. "Is she on drugs? Does she use drugs?" I just told your colleagues. I'm telling you. Then another round of people come in, "Is she on drugs?" I'm like, "Do y'all talk?" They finally take her in an ambulance to the closest hospital. - That was not the place where I would want my daughter to be sent ever. There was no money in that hospital. They didn't have what they needed to care for her. They had been divested from. They eventually figured it was a pulmonary embolism. But all they could do there is give her blood thinners and hope that the blood clot would pop. We waited, you know, and it was, I want to say, a solid 12 hours. So many people were showing up at the hospital, just standing in the hallway, praying, praying, praying like, you know, putting it out there that she was going to, some... a miracle was gonna happen. - And I'm watching this while watching my daughter in distress. And just thinking, if they would have listened to her during that postpartum time, it wouldn't have come to this point. My cousin comes in the room and she's like, "She's gone." Everybody just fell apart. There's just so many levels of frustrations that come, you know, and just understanding the scope of who we are and what we look like and where we live, you know, and the stereotypes that come with that, you know. Having to deal with that on top of watching your partner pass away, you know, it's, um, tough isn't the word, you know. It's, it's, it's more than tough. Let's go downstairs. Alright. You ready? Let's go. Telling Anari that her mother passed away was, it was hard. She asks about her mother all the time. - Anari! Okay. You want to give daddy hugs. Okay. Shamony definitely was, you know, my muse. - Omari here is going to be doing my makeup. - It's going to be money. Go. Got to start in the middle, right? Make sure you put it on nice and thick. I've never lived in this house without her. There's times where I wake up, and I'm just shocked to be sleeping in our bed by myself. It's hard adjusting. I can't believe that Amber is not going to be coming back home. - So this month, we'll be learning about plants. So today, I'm going to demonstrate how to plant. Organic potting mix, it's usually good for every kind of plant. You're gonna need... I'm using a Mason jar, but you don't need to use a Mason jar. You can use whatever you have at home. This is going to get messy, so I'm sure the kids will love this. Let them. If you do have soil at home, let them experience it, play with it. Um, it's a good sensory activity as well... I can still hear her feet, stomping her feet and running in. She, uh, opens the door and jumps straight on the bed and starts jumping on me and pushing me and pulling on me and waking me up, uh, and she says that we're pregnant. It's a boy. Amber had such a pregnant glow to her. She was just so excited. During her second and third trimester, we started noticing she was having headaches. She was getting dizzy, and she was having a tough time breathing. And all of her concerns were being taken lightly. "Oh, these are just pregnancy-related symptoms. You're okay." So I took the initiative to search and do research on midwives and doulas and stumbled across Nubia Martin. Bruce and Amber reached out trying to switch over to home birth. So let's start right here. Okay. - She knew something was off, and she was hoping that switching to midwifery care would get to the bottom of that. Walk your hands... When they sent her prenatal records for us to review, the first thing that jumped out was the issue with the platelets. I said this is not right. You need to go to the hospital. If the platelet levels go lower than 150, they need to be monitored. Her platelet levels had been less and deteriorating since December. We're in April. This is high risk. The hospital's not bringing this to our attention at all. Amber wanted to write a tell-all about the care that she had been receiving. Finally, they started paying attention to her and diagnosed her with HELLP syndrome. They could have caught it early, treated it. She went into the hospital. They induced her labor, and they rushed her into a C-section. The high-risk doctor just left my daughter there with some, uh, a young team there. They cut her open. Her blood is water-like at this point. She's lied open on the table, bleeding out. They were neglecting her until it was way too late. We thought Montefiore was going to take care of her. We had Amber's mother, who worked there for 25 years. They gave that statement that they had a mortality rate of 0.01 percent. That's all I got from them. Amber would've been a wonderful mother. She was working on her masters. She wanted to be an art therapist. She started teaching, and she loved these kids. She wanted this so badly, you know. She's my only child. She's all I had. I'm grateful that she left Elias for us. What's going on, man? How you doing, man? Yo, I got to give you a hug, bro. Oh, man. I heard about Bruce and what happened to Amber Isaac. I just immediately reached out to him to just say, "Hey, man, it's a lot. I know exactly how you feel. If you need somebody to talk to, then, you know, here I am." I wanted specifically to just meet you, because I know that y'all know how I'm feeling. Even if I'm not able to articulate it the way I want to, like, I know. - It's like this shit, this shit is just so, like, surreal sometimes. Like, I just be thinking, like, "Damn, this can't be real life." Yeah. - You know, I still got that... I feel like somebody's foot is in my throat, like... - Yeah. Yeah. - Like, that's... - I know. I still don't feel like I've grasped the entire concept of her not being here physically, you know. And of course, there's other people in our position, you know, so that's why I feel too, we can turn our pain into power and make something of this, you know. So, I could either... chill or I could, you know, do something, you know. And I'm taking the position of doing something because, you know, that's what I know that we are here for, you know. - Yeah. I got to take action in some way, some way. I got to... If I'm not doing nothing, I at least got to study so I know what I'm fighting against. Yeah. Alright. You ready to do this? - Ready when you ready. - Alright, cool, cool. Just got to keep going. That's it. That's all we got to do, one foot in front of the other. Come on. come on. This is it right there, right here. Amber and Shamony at the finish line. Come on. - Woo! Right in there. Come on now. - Hi! Hey, we matching? I was aware that this is a growing epidemic in our communities, and that is so upsetting to me. An alarm has to be sounded about this. I never thought that this would happen to my family. Yes. - Because I do reproductive justice work. - Mm-hmm. But, you know, just also, why wouldn't it? We're Black and brown. Right. Right. - You know, she's a woman. She was having a baby, so why would we think we would be exempt? Because we have the knowledge? Mm-hmm. - Knowledge doesn't save you from this epidemic. That's right. - Omari, I can't speak for you, but I'm mourning growing old with my daughter. - Yeah, definitely. - We were 20 years apart, and the women in my family live a long time. So I anticipated being 90 and her being 70 and getting on each other's nerves in that space, you know, um. So mourning what could have been is also very real. - I definitely want to partner with fathers who specifically have suffered loss the way I have and to get fathers together to just really talk about how after, you know, you lose somebody important, how the community helps. - If it's possible to have this space be one of the hubs where men gather and have these conversations, I especially want it for Black men, because it's a desert out there in reference to support. - You know, this is not something that is just specific to me or specific to just a handful of people. Like, hundreds and thousands of men are going through this same, you know, scenario, situation. Look, Daddy. Hello. - Look. Hi. - Good morning. Is Anthony there? I'm one of Anthony's math teachers. This is Anthony. - Um, so what's going on, Anthony? You haven't been really completing your math assignments, so I just wanted to see what was the reason for that? - I want to do the race car. - Okay. Race car. Okay, baby. If you're having some troubles with your math work, then you're going to get in contact with me, and I'm going to help you out with it, okay? Okay. Alright, awesome. You have a great day, Anthony. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. You're a little tricky, huh? You trying to get tricky? You trying to get tricky? As I'm trying to get through day to day, a handful of men got in contact with me. Their partners also passed away. And it had such an effect on me. I wasn't by myself. - Thank you for all the brothers who came, and I'm definitely grateful, uh, for what we're able to do, creating this circle, you know, with Omari to support brothers like Omari and Mustafa who are in the particular place where they sit. - My name's Mustafa Shabazz. Me and Omari, we're basically going through the same pain right now. My lady died. Like you said, you felt hopeless? I felt the same way. I watched her take her last breath in front of my eyes, and there was nothing I can do. Nothing. I had, I had to go and get a DNA test just to take my son out of the hospital. They didn't believe that he was my son. I said, why would I be here? Why would I... Why would I even be here if this is not my child? I just, honestly, I just don't think they care. When we stop to think about maternal mortality, that's a reality that any of us can face, and as a father with a daughter, that's scary for me. We have to give ourselves permission to be angry. And so it's important for us that we have a space where I can go and create the relationships where we're vulnerable enough to share in this environment. - It could be any one of us. Honestly, man. Like, the tables just turned so fast, you know, when you, you don't have no, you don't have the control, you don't have the power. But with that said, uh, you could have the support. You know, we could support each other, creating the community that we want to see, and the way we want to see it, you know. With that community, I want to create a space where we can then start to try to change policy, you know, and have a thousand, hundreds of thousands of people backing what we're saying. Because that's the only way it works. Today, we stand in solidarity with the family of Amber Isaac. - I can't even believe we're even here today about this situation. Amber was just such a divine woman. All she wanted to do was help people. And y'all took that from us. Um, I actually had some stuff that I had written down that I want to discuss and that I want to go over because my mind It's okay. - Has been everywhere since this whole situation occurred. We're supposed to be the most advanced country in the world, but the racial disparities are becoming more and more evident each day. Black women are four times more likely to die than their white counterparts with the same symptoms. The maternal mortality rate has doubled here in the United States. It was safer for our parents to have children than it is for us today. Amen. - Why is that? - Welcome, everybody. I'm Dr. Neel Shah, and this is Expecting More Dialogues which is the new web series we're kicking off that is exploring the opportunities, the challenges, the hopes, and the lived experiences of people who are giving birth in America right now. We've invited three incredible human beings to be part of this dialogue that we're going to have today and to teach me and to teach all of us about what it is that we can be doing about this problem. So let's start here maybe. Bruce, um, tell us what happened. I'm not sure everybody out there knows the story. - Amber was facing negligence and incompetence within the medical system. Down from the OB to the, um, to the secretary was being nasty with her. Down to security. You know? The day I took Amber in, when she was admitted into the hospital, security at the front telling me, "Oh, it's okay, Mr. Babydaddy, go sit down over there. You can't go up." You know, everything that Bruce described in his story is things that advocates like myself and others have been saying for years, right, that we have a systemic issue. And I've said it in, in, in packed rooms, full of OBs. You know what I mean? Like, patients, ultimately, they want to be seen, they want to be heard, and they want to know that someone genuinely cares about their wellbeing. I think that the wellbeing of moms is a bellwether for the wellbeing of society in general. And that's why every injustice in our society shows up in maternal health and in maternal health outcomes. In 2018, journalists started to tell the stories of people that were dying in childbirth. Those stories ended up compelling the federal government to start to track maternal mortality much more systematically. So 2018 was the first year we really did that. I started to read and see all these trends, including the explosion in C-section rates. We intervene with major surgery 500 percent more than we used to in the 1970s. And maternal mortality rates just fly upwards. And when it comes to Black women, those risks are higher. C-sections do save lives. I'm trained to do them. I believe in them. But major surgery is major surgery. Surgical complications like organ injury, hemorrhage, infection are about three times more likely to happen with a C-section than a vaginal delivery. Oh, it's very cute. Congratulations to you both. Thank you so much. Thank you. Black women have a higher rate of C-sections. Yeah. I would really encourage you to do that. I started to think about my own practice and how it's possible that really well-intended people can be doing racist things. For example, when Black people are expressing concern around pain or other symptoms, they're heard less. And in medicine, we've literally created algorithms where we've conflated race and racism. You can help somebody understand their odds of having a successful vaginal delivery with a calculator. And if they're Black, their odds drop. And it has nothing to do with who they are or their biology. The calculator ends up gatekeeping treatment, care, and support. So if you're Black, you're less likely to get good support to have the vaginal delivery that you want. I've been a midwife 23 years. I went to Georgetown University. I have a bachelor's of science in nursing, and I have a masters in midwifery education. Let's see what this baby is doing today. We are trained to let those that can have births that happen spontaneously the way it's always been. We care for women in the home, birth centers, and the hospital space. The head is still down. Mm-hmm. Nice and down. We follow a shared decision-making model with the patient, giving them a lot of options to choose their path. So you got everything prepared for the birth? Mm-hmm. I'm here to practice an allowance for her body to do what it needs to do to give birth. Only six to nine percent of all births in our country are by midwives. In Europe, midwives were integrated into women's healthcare, and they're doing better than our dismal maternal mortality morbidity rate. We are higher than the UK, higher than France, higher than Germany, higher than Sweden. We have the highest rate of all industrialized nations. In this country, as technology has advanced, childbirth has become more technologically driven. In hospitals, by and large, um, it has not been a shared decision-making model. We call it the medical technocratic patriarchal model. Pregnancy is a healthcare challenge to manage. - We have 9:00 a. m. induction of a 21-year-old G1, P0 at 39 and three. We have two inductions, we have KW of a 34-year-old G3, P1-0-1-1. And the other 7:00 p. m. induction is a CWC Fetal Specialty Clinic patient who's had a history of one prior C-section. Doctors are trained in active management of labor. Induce them and get them going and do all this stuff. You put her on Pitocin via the IV to get the contractions regular. The goal is every two to three minutes for your contractions. Okay. You break the water and you do things to push her along the labor curve, as we call it, um, to get that baby out. The thing that she's going to remember the most is what happened during her labor and birth. Every woman does. Women have to take that back. Women of color count for nearly 80 percent of pregnancy-related death in this city. We are just dragging our feet on one of the most serious issues of our time. We're going to call up Shawnee B. Gibson. - I'm a fellow citizen and mother in mourning over the loss of my eldest child whose death could have been prevented. Today, I act as a vessel and a conduit for the voice of my daughter, Shamony Makeba Gibson, and the voices of so many young women of color just like her. As a reproductive advocate and leader in the reproductive health community, I thought that I would be spared. I naively believed that my optimism about how knowledgeable we all were would shield her from this epidemic. Wow. What I am seeking are systems and institutions that are committed to making sure that we address racism and anti-Black racism, specifically. I am here to declare that my work will not stop. I am here to hold myself accountable and to hold those responsible who knowingly and unknowingly keep this epidemic going. I am here to let you know that Shamony Makeba Gibson lived. She is alive in this movement, and she is alive in this moment as I speak her name, Shamony Makeba Gibson. Shamony Makeba Gibson. Shamony Makeba Gibson. Thank you for listening. As a professor at Harvard School of Public Health, I had an opportunity to travel to different hospitals across the country, studying maternal health outcomes. Oklahoma is a place that has a maternal mortality rate that's double the national average. When you rank every state in terms of maternal mortality, they're in the bottom five. The medical centers that we're working with in Tulsa have some of the highest rates of injury during childbirth in the state. They take care of a lot of people of color, and they have a persistently high C-section rate. We're here today because we think that we could get the whole country to reimagine the care that people should expect during one of the most important and vulnerable moments of our lives. This will only really work if each and every one of you believes that this is possible too. This is triage. - Hi. Awesome. Labor and delivery units in the modern era resemble cardiac ICUs. The only difference is that our operating rooms are attached. We take 99 percent of people giving birth in America, we put them in ICUs, and we surround them by surgeons. So we see a lot of surgery. It doesn't take rocket science to figure it out. - We get a lot of laboring patients out here. And how many ORs do you guys have? - Two. Are they right on the unit? - Yes. Yeah. - Yeah. In a hospital, the cost of doing a C-section is lower than the cost of doing a vaginal delivery. The shorter that labor is, the less it will cost. It is also true though, that if you do a C-section the hospital gets paid about 50 percent more than if there's vaginal delivery. You can imagine what kind of incentives that might set up. Hey, how are you? Good. Edwards. Okay. In this state, Black women represent ten percent of births, but we're 20 percent of the deaths. And Tulsa is one of the worst places in the country to have a baby. I didn't know. How are you today? Alright. How you doing? FELICIA: Good. Well, let's take a look at baby. Let's measure this belly. Okay. I called my mom crying one morning because the statistics of being Black having a baby in America, like, hit me. Really I hadn't thought about it until Serena Williams talked about her birth experience and she's, like, the best athlete in the world. And she had to make them listen to her about her blood clots. And then when I started dealing with myself, I was like, this is a big deal. A Black woman having a baby is like a Black man in a traffic stop with the police. You have to, like, really pay attention to what's going on, like, every step of the way. There you go. And in the hospital, appointments are quick, they're not intimate. You don't have time to build that trust. Have a good day. You too. It's going to be hard to find someone I'm just comfortable with. Very early in my career, I noticed how Black women were, uh, used as guinea pigs in the hospital, um, system. I became a nurse in a very elite teaching hospital, and I started to see things that just really don't go along with my philosophy. If you have private insurance and you're white, you have a private physician who's on call for you. The clinic population by and large tend to be Black and brown women who have Medicaid, are treated by resident learners. Every woman is getting her vagina cut open. A woman doesn't need it, but you cut it because you need to learn how to sew. I'm at a place that is literally practicing on people. Black women have been experimented on to perfect the profession of gynecology. The United States had a population of enslaved peoples that they could do what they wanted to, when they wanted to, how they wanted to do it. As a woman, your worth is about what your womb can produce for my plantation. Black women are having so many children, they're getting fistulas. Enter J. Marion Sims. He's considered the father of gynecology who decides that he's going to figure out how to fix this. He's fixing it so she can go back and have more children so that she, as a commodity, continues to be useful for her slave master. And he cut them open however many times. And then there were modules written about the things that were done to them saying, well, they don't feel pain, but the woman is literally screaming. And that's how the United States becomes a superpower when it comes to OB/GYN surgery. Black women by and large continue to be cared for by learners. It's the marrying of the over-medicalization with inexperience that's really the foundation when it comes to maternal mortality and morbidity. Momma. Who is that? - Mommy. Good. Now show us your project. Come. I see it. Whoa. Let's do it. Don't spill it! Look, Mommy. Wow, that's pretty! Let me see it. - Hmm? Let me see it. Good. We have pictures of Shamony up everywhere. She's always around. Through my artwork, I'm able to connect with her in a way that I've never had since she passed. It really does help with how I process. One day I thought, right now, I paint one of Amber Isaac, paint one of Bruce's partner. I wanted to give him this gift. - I'm gonna set up over here. Sanitizers. Thank you. Alright. So the front, we got to get the front gate. Hey, how are you? Good. Good, good, good, good. I'm sorry. How you feeling? How you doing? - Hanging in there? - Sweating bullets, are you? - I know. I'm here working. Yeah. I'm here working. Speaking of the... Yo, we was just talking about you. Really? Yeah, I had to... I got here, like, five, ten minutes ago but I had to stop and get some coffee. I knew you were addicted. You got free hands or somebody to hold your... Alright. Cool, cool. This is for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, man. Love you, man. Love you, too. We're doing this together, man. Thank y'all so much for being here. This is our first event. We're a little nervous, but we need to be here. We need to keep talking until they're hearing us. We're tired of saying that we need justice. We need change. We're done asking. We're demanding. - Nobody's asking for anything exorbitant or extravagant or out of the ordinary. We just want to make sure that we have the same as anybody else. We are dying at a rate 12 times more in this city. If these numbers were flipped around and white women were dying at the rate that Black women are dying, it would be a national crisis. Why is that not deemed a crisis? This crazy behind system is killing us. We call it Aftershock, because Shamony's death was like a tsunami. When Black mothers die, there's a ripple effect and, yes, the death is the earthquake. But the shit afterward is overwhelming. The nights where I get up, and it's like, "Oh my god, I miss my daughter. I miss her calling me." Now I wish she would call me 30 times a day. After today, taking action, Shamony lives through me being an activist and a revolutionary and the revolution will be tweeted, Instagrammed, Facebooked. It will be recorded. Two fathers are sharing their heartbreak to draw attention to medical disparities in Black communities. Shamony's death was a direct result of systemic racism. Within the medical system, there's been this repetitive pattern. If Amber would've received standard care, she would be here. And that's what he wants now for every mother of color. Part of what I want to think through with you all is just about, like, the messaging. And I think it's really important that we name what the mission is, which is equity. Mm-hmm. It can't be safer for all mothers until it's safer for Black mothers, Native mothers. And so when we talk about equity, there's folks who have to catch up before that can even, like, be a thing. Yeah. You know, you can't fix things that you don't name, and I do deeply believe that. We're really, really fortunate to be working with a community partner, LaBrisa Williams, an extraordinary advocate for birth justice and birth equity, is someone that we can stand shoulder to shoulder with as we're walking around the hospitals and trying to build that accountability to the community within the health systems. You guys ready to start? Yeah, sure. Yeah. So we'll gather right over there. We designed a process that structures communication. So every person giving birth has a systematic way of knowing that what they're expecting, what they want to know, what they want to say is going to get heard. Everything that we're reading in the headlines about maternal mortality in our country going up, what people are dying of is not the clinical condition on the death certificate. It's a failure of communication, teamwork every time. What Team Birth is about, it's doing the things that we already know, but making sure the people that we're caring for can see it. We really focus on patient experience and, like, make sure they feel seen and heard. Yeah. That's awesome. It's a very, very simple idea. It's a version of the same dry erase whiteboard that exists in almost every inpatient room in every hospital in America. Usually, that board is primarily for nurses to kind of talk to themselves. We structured it to have the preferences of the person giving birth. And then there's a place where you write down the next time the team is going to get back together again and talk. - The most important thing is that we're being transparent with the patient about what the plan is. I'm sure you all have seen the headlines around maternal mortality. You've seen the way that it's been impacting the people that you're caring for. So this is about better outcomes, which is also about building trust along the way. When we walk through Bruce's story, there's so many examples of that not happening, not only not feeling seen and heard, but also not being told what was happening. Right? That should never happen. It's Bruce. - Hello, guys. What's up, everybody? Oh. Oh, look at the couches. Yes! How's Elias? - Oh, he's doing good. I really started talking to Nubia more about the medical system. Now that more people are paying attention, we have to band together to bring effective change and help our communities. My name is Bruce McIntyre. Us as a collective have been doing a lot of groundwork, redirecting the course for birthing equity. - I met Bruce and Amber, his partner, because they were being grossly neglected in the hospital setting. Amber did not survive. And one of the things I was talking to Bruce about was how we continue to just honor, um, who she was as, as a mother and make sure this doesn't happen for somebody else. Like, we can sit and, you know, wait for somebody to sweep in, but it's an SOS situation and we have to save ourselves. Yeah. - I know that what I want in my communities, in my birth communities, from my clients is support. When I think of the hospital climate, some people are welcoming birth support and other hospitals are not. - Right. My belief is that, you know, people need to have safe options across the board. Safer hospitals or, like I always say, look for alternatives. You know, you don't have to birth at a hospital if that's not, you know, if you're part of that 85 percent that's low risk, you know. But we want to do the best that we can to give people a safe vaginal birth, if that is their desire, in an environment where they're going to be listened to, respected, valued, and, you know, at peace. Yeah. Can I touch your belly? Uh-huh. - How are you doing? Oh, Lily-bug. What's going on in there? There's a lot going on. Yeah. So this is what we're going to do. We're going to try this exercise. - Okay. And this is going to show what it looks like when you have a contraction, what a contraction does. Okay? So, this is your baby. This is the uterus. You're going to put the baby in your uterus. I don't know what I would be doing without a doula right now. She's from Tulsa. She's Black. I have, like, a friend who's educated in this that I talk to every two weeks. Keep contracting, keep on going. I don't know if we talked about this, but I would like to touch on it, like what a normal birth is and what a normal birth looks like. There's such a wide range of what normal is. You can think of a normal birth as like the train tracks and then your birth experience as the train, alright? And then sometimes, things happen. We may have to switch tracks and go around or whatever, and that's okay. At first, when we did the birth plan, I was like, "I'm just going to go to the hospital, you know, the normal thing." And then we talk about, like, all the choices or the options, and then I was like, "Maybe a birth center is better." We on track. The main thing for me is I do not want to have a C-section. Paul and I are entrepreneurs. We generate our own income. I don't have a grandmother that can come stay with us. We don't have the resources for a night nurse. It says right here. Okay. Having a major surgery will impact our success as a new family for the next 12 months. Hello? Hello. Felicia? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Paul. Paul. Nice to meet you. We've met before, haven't we? Yeah. Ashlee. Okay. Ashlee, okay. Nice to meet you.Yes. Well, I'm going to give you guys your tour today. I'm trying to talk about the risk versus benefits of hospital versus birth center births, so... Perfect. Alright. Okay. Well, let's go over this way. We have three birth suites back here, and I'm going to show you the first one. This is the Gavin suite. When you come in in labor, you get your room, um, we settle you in, check you in, and then we just see what feels good to you. Maybe you want to go for a walk down at the park. Maybe you want to go to the Y and walk on the track. Maybe you want to go to the mall and walk around. Maybe you want to get in the tub for a little bit. So it's really just up to you. And we just go along with you and carry our Doppler and monitor baby and make sure that you're doing okay, and baby's doing okay while you work through your labor stuff. So... This is the Bella suite, a little bougie in here. A little bougie. - Mom is like, yeah. That's my girl. There you go, Felicia. - This is the room I designed. Oh wow. - Yeah. It's pretty cool. - You're taking it all in? - I'm definitely taking it in. I haven't even gotten in yet. Like... This is crazy but amazing at the same time. Yeah. I'm getting an understanding. - I'm going to try to walk you through some of our medical things that we have in place here. My kids call this the scary cart. We are certified nurse midwives here, so we do follow the medical model in that we have a suture kit for your bottom. And I will tell you, we throw more of these away because they expire than we use them. And the reason for that is we give you the most important gift as a first-time mom. And that is time, time to be in labor, time to stretch. But if we need to repair your bottom afterwards, we can do that. And then the medication box. We don't do inductions of labor here, but we do have Pitocin and a couple of other medications that will help with hemorrhaging if you were to hemorrhage after you delivered. - Paul's been working a lot. I've been researching more. Like, I'm really educating myself, and I'm like, I'm just trying to have this baby safely. - Let me just, let me break down just a few of the statistics for you, okay. So with birth centers, the C-section rate's about six percent. In the hospital, the national average is around 30, 33 percent. But we don't value a vaginal delivery in this setting over your safety. Okay. I've had four C-sections. Medically, I wasn't able to have a vaginal birth. - I'm, like, totally aware of how fortunate we are to have this option this close to where we live. I know people drive hours here too. I have one family come over from almost four hours away in Arkansas. They got an Airbnb and stayed the last couple weeks of the pregnancy with their family so that they could enjoy birth center care here. - How did you, like, guys decide to open this? Like, it's like against the system. Yeah. It was incredibly difficult, but this is a calling for us to do this. The unfortunate thing is they will not, insurance-wise, will not cover any of our care. Uh, so it would be a sole out-of-pocket expense for you to do that. Okay. Now, since you're coming to us late, the total for us would be 3,000. - That's not bad. I mean, I'm pretty much sold. It's nothing I didn't really... see out of place or anything like that. I feel like switching over, I don't really have to worry about anything. Like, I'm more controlled on knowing what's going to happen instead of whatever's going on in that hospital that day. My grandmother had three children successfully. My dad was the only one born in the hospital. - I don't think it matters which one it is. I'm going to be right there with you. And I have nine nieces and nephews. So I know about, like, children and birthing. - Let me tell you, Mr. I Know Everything. There's two things you don't know and you can't do. - How to be a woman and how to have a baby. Yeah. Yeah, you right. - Midwives existed in all nations and cultures of the earth. Midwives knew the feminine secrets. Midwives were abortion practitioners since the beginning of time, helping women control their fertility and control the use of their wombs. That's a lot of power. In spaces where women have power, some men have a problem with it. In Europe, the Catholic church wants more control of childbearing women and their choices. It's the church that first demands that men be a part of childbirth. Enter the male midwife, who then later on segues and becomes the OB/GYN provider. And priests, they're hearing these reports that women scream and women yell and they become animalistic. They, they become this other thing when they're in childbirth, that has not been seen before by men. We of course have the scripture in the Bible and the Lord's prayer, deliver us from evil. There becomes this identification with being delivered from evil. You start to see this language that women need to be delivered. They need to be delivered. And we've carried that into modern day. When we get to United States history, when enslaved people come here, midwives come with them. Midwives are on every plantation, not just caring for enslaved Black people. They were caring for everybody. When the mistress of the plantation and her daughters and white women are having babies, they're being attended by Black midwives too. Midwives become some of the most valued enslaved persons. George Washington himself actually paid his midwife. She was so valuable because he wanted to make sure that generations and generations of enslaved beings made it earth-side safely. After slavery, we still have community midwives. Over time, these powerful white men, this new thing called an OB/GYN physician decide we are going to deem that you should come to the hospital to give birth. White male physicians and white public health nurses bond together and create a whole lot of marketing campaigns that say Black midwives are dirty. They're unskilled. They're untrained. White public health nurses would actually run around and hunt to find out where the midwives were, forcing them to go to health departments and turn in their license, saying to them, "If you catch another baby, I'll report you, and you'll go to jail." And midwifery becomes a book knowledge profession. You become a nurse, and then you take this extra training to work in concert with the doctor. It is not a profession that you grow into through apprenticeship anymore. So white women took over this profession. Right now, 87 percent of all midwives certified in the United States of America are white. Hi, Georgette, hi. I'm very involved with students around the nation, especially here in New York. We need more midwives in the space. Cecilia caught the twins, Oh my goodness. - First twins, she caught. The United States has to adopt the same modality as all other countries, and midwives have to be central to women's healthcare. Good night. Alright. Night-night. Midwifery care supports Black women because when it's done well, it's anti-traumatic care. It is a way to reconstruct the narrative that childbirth does not have to be this process that's laced in abuse. - Good job. - That felt good. Yeah. Good job. - Let's see if I can eat one more before one comes. When the contraction comes, I don't want to eat because I feel like I'm going to choke trying to keep myself together. - What you smiling about? take care of you while I'm asleep, huh? 122 over 70. Rocking it out, mama. - Ohhh! I think it's deeper now. Mm-hmm. - You got it. - Is she okay? She is just perfectly content. - She's like right down here where my hand is. Ohh. - So, are we ready? Not yet. Mmm. You're doing amazing. You're almost there. - It's the hardest thing I ever did. Okay. Here comes one. - You want the pillow? You got this. - Yeah? Yeah. Mm-hmm. There you go, there you go, there you go. So good. Breathe it out. Good. - Take your time. Reach down. Reach down. Open your eyes. Want to reach down and help? - No. He can help. - There we go. You did it. Woo! That's your baby. Oh my god. Hey, baby. Say hi, mommy. Hi. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi, sweetheart. You did it. Baby, she's here. Yeah, she's here, baby. You did it. Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Don't cry. I know, sweetheart. Happy birthday. There's your mama. You are beautiful. All that hair. I know. I know. - I can't believe this is real. Thank you. She here, baby. She is here. - She's here and beautiful. - Oh my goodness. Oh wow. This is the space I'm excited. Wow. - So, we're thinking about making the first two floors the birth center and then the third floor, the reception and a couple exam rooms and a couple wellness spots. And then in that corner, that's going to be a small community room where we can have, um, smaller classes happen. We're going to bring a birthing center over here to the Bronx. We need it. We have the highest Cesarean rate in this borough. - It's pretty big. Ready? Action. - We are partnering up to bring a birthing center to the Bronx, to serve our community, to serve our people. We need to stop working for a system that is not going to work for us. And we need to take care of our communities. We need to step up. - Within the entire state of more than 19 million people, there are only three birth centers. This needs to change. Birthing centers are a happy medium of a hospital birth, a very necessary option, and home birth, which is a wonderful option, but not for everybody. - Even if you can't donate, figure out what you can do to play your part to help us. Thank you. - We deserve a birthing center. - We deserve a birthing center. - We deserve birth centers. Yes. - Yes. Yes. Yes. Hello?Hey. How are you, man? Doing well, doing well, Neel. How are you? It's good to see you. Good to see you. How was the trip? Oh, brother. It was, it wasn't bad. It wasn't bad. - We so appreciate you, um, coming up and then spend time with our students today. - Definitely. - I couldn't imagine when we talked last year that we'd be here. - Yeah. - Doing this. - Me neither. I was just thinking about that, like how surreal it is. You know, that's just what moving forward does, you know. You just got to keep pushing forward, and doors open up. - Yeah. Amber Rose Isaac was the love of my life. She passed away due to an unscheduled emergency C-section that stemmed from medical negligence throughout her entire pregnancy. After finding out all this information and doing so much studying, I found out that Amber was as good as dead as soon as she walked into that hospital. So we need to make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone else. In 2018, I watched Amber... What people like Bruce have taught me is that affirming a person's dignity, seeing them, hearing them is the way that you make them safe. It's not a luxury. Thank you so much. I actually remember being on Twitter, hearing about Amber Rose. And so it is so surreal to me right now to be sitting next to you, to hear you tell your story, to capture the things that a news article will never be able to capture. This fight is not over. And there are times, because this is, it feels like it's so in my face, because this is the work that I'm interested, "Oh, enough people know about this." But it's not enough, right? Because too many people are still dying from this. Right? There will still be another, which is one too many already. - As a white provider, I'm going to have a blind spot that is, I don't have any lived experience with racism in this way. And it's really, really easy to become part of the problem if you're not actively working towards understanding these types of stories. I know you say that this shouldn't ever happen again, but the fact is it will. Um, and so I think it's important to have spaces of activism and healing to be prepared for that. - You know, we're not going to be able to save everyone, but with Black lives, Black women, it's believed that over 60 percent of these deaths were preventable. That's more than half we're talking about. That sounds like a choice to me. That sounds like a system. And if you're here today, that shows me that you want to reimagine the system. So I appreciate everyone being here. - Alright. I'm down here in Houston to meet a father I've never met before. But who I am definitely connected to. After I created a piece for Amber, I created a piece for another woman, and it just started to become like, um, what I was doing. Creating pieces for other families who have lost their daughters, their mothers, their partners. To keep their stories going. I've started to meet more families than I ever could have imagined, all over the country, and build a community that is needed. What's good, bro? Man, I'm happy to be out here, man. Yeah. - Good to see you. After Maria had the baby in the hospital, they came and told us, hey, we had to, you know, it's time to go, you know, time to check out. But, you know, uh, she's not even able to walk. Maybe we can, you know, extend this somehow, whatever, you know? Can she get more help? But, you know, when the insurance don't, don't pay for it... They don't care about you that much. - Somebody hit me up on IG, and they told me, you know, about you and your story and, you know, Maria. I felt compelled, like I got to speak to you to let you know, like, you know, like, I don't know you, you know, but I know how you feel, man. Like, I know what you're going through. I know, I know the pain. I know what it is. Mm-hmm. With that said, I want to give you this. I'm so happy, man, that I was able to come out here and, and give it to you first hand. Oh, man. - I know that Shamony and Maria are up there wherever they are. They're probably in the room right now with us, honestly. But, you know, they connecting. You know, they making stuff happen for both of us, man. Small, something small I could do, man. It's the very least I could do for you, bro. Appreciate you, man. - I appreciate this, bro. No doubt. No doubt. - Yeah. It's dope. So, on the count of three, we going to get this started. One, two, three. Alright. Here, wait a minute. Who wants some? Um, Charles? Open your mouth, Charles. That-that-that's okay. Bruce? Where's Elias? Let him open his mouth. Now, I want to say thank y'all. I love y'all. We love y'all. This is a very... It's been a very emotionally driven and a very emotional rollercoaster for me, especially this last couple of hours, but, you know, specifically these last couple of days. And, um, I didn't know how I was going to get through it. And the anxiety of me thinking about trying to get through it by myself is... it's enough to kill somebody, you know. But the fact that I have all of you as support, it makes it so much easier to put and keep a smile on my face, man. So, thank y'all again. I love y'all. We love y'all. Take care. Bye. - Peace Ahhh, ya got me! - Let's do our little ritual. Now I'm starting to feel the butterflies. Let your hands be the hands. - Ase. - Mm-hmm. - This one is purity. Your mantra. Yeah. - I act from pure intentions. - Yes. So, for today, it's not about me. So I'm going to... I'm getting so emotional. - That's okay. - Just moving myself out of the way so Shamony can speak through me so that women can live. So... And then anybody that does not know about this, um, epidemic, not the pandemic, but the epidemic of maternal mortality and morbidity will be, um, able to receive that and walk away with knowledge and then also prayerfully some action. You ready? Mm-hmm. - Alright, here we go. How are you? I'm good. Pretty good this morning. Our next speaker is a licensed clinician, author, healer, spiritual leader, and a reproductive justice advocate and activist. Shawnee Benton-Gibson. - Black lives matter, but Black wombs create Black lives. And when we forget that, we forget our humanity. We want to make sure that our grandbabies, our children have mothers to raise them. And that fathers are not left to figure it out on their own. We must stop this. Black lives matter because Black wombs matter. Black lives matter because Black wombs matter. Black lives matter because Black wombs matter, and a Black womb created you. I want white supremacy to get off the necks of women and their wombs. This momentum is like a wave. We keep showing up. We're not letting the pain stop us. We are holding people who have the most power accountable for how they use it. Our maternal health community is really pushing for change on Capitol Hill, trying to bring about different legislation in order to make sure that women have the care that they're supposed to. - I can't let Amber be another statistic. I'm making people aware of what's going on in these systems. I planned on spending a lifetime with Amber. I wanted to give her my life. This way, I'm still going to. Amber Rose Isaac. We hear you, we see you. Shamony Gibson. We hear you, we see you. Kira Johnson, we hear you, we see you. We're taking a closer look at the maternal mortality rate in the United States. - This issue of maternal health... - I introduced a bill called the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act. It's 12 bills to end our nation's maternal mortality crisis. - All those families who have been impacted, who even in the face of their trauma and their devastating losses continue to amplify their voices, that is really why this work is happening today. - Our healthcare system including reproductive healthcare was built on a legacy of systemic racism, and that legacy continues today. - Madam Chairwoman, as we approach Mother's Day, my heart is heavy as I sit here representing the thousands upon thousands of families that have been impacted. These are my sons, Charles and Langston. My wife Kira won't wake up to breakfast in bed this Mother's Day because she gave birth... in a country that didn't see her, that didn't value her. We must do better. This is Amber Rose Isaac. Her son Elias won't have the chance to spend his first Mother's Day with his mother. Elias deserved better. Shamony Gibson should be here with her son, Khari, and her daughter, Anari. She deserved so much better. This is a human rights issue. It should be a fundamental human right to deliver a healthy child in this country and live to raise that child. That's my hope. Greetings, family. The reason why we are gathered here today is because Shamony Makeba Gibson lived. Gone too soon, like a comet blazing across the evening sky. Gone too soon, like a rainbow fading in the twinkling of an eye. Gone too soon, shiny and sparkly and splendidly bright, here one day and gone one night. Like a castle built upon a sandy beach, gone too soon. Like a perfect flower that is just beyond your reach, That's my mommy. gone too soon. Shamony Makeba Gibson, we will never, ever forget you. Amen.
