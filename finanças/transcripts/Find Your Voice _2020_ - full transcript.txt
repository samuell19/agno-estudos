Joseph, can you return to Hong Kong and inspire a group of teenagers? I formed a choir. Like the one we talked about back then. Find your voice. Your experience should be helpful to them. "Hong Kong" You think music can solve their problems? They don't have problems. But people in this world are too used to judging others by their first impressions. No doubt a report card differentiates high scores, and low scores. Good students from bad ones. But music is the most primitive sound deep down and there should be no bias. Is it worth it? No child should be left behind. Regarding this project, I'll bear all the costs. You don't have to pay for anything. I have been the chairman of the realty association of the eastern district for 4 years. I'm very good with numbers. Do you know what you're doing for these kids will cost a lot of money? Yes how about this? I'll do it, but I'll be the chairman. You put up the money, I'll be in charge. It won't fail with my involvement. Don't accuse me of showing no support. Here's the file on the kids. Fung shun-hei grew up in a broken home. Tsang siu-lung lives with his single mom. Yeung ka-bik only cares about dating. Wan yee is a cosplayer. Miu lai is autistic. Lau siu-kuen is completely unmotivated. She only cares about looking pretty... Actually, I don't think any of that matters. I trust you can help them. I'm counting on you. None of your business! Come on! Get out of my face! "Ka-bik: Miss you baby Frankie: I love you" Doesn't it hurt? You haven't tried it before? What's with your friend? You mean miu lai? She's not normal. We were in the same class for 4 years. She only stares at the bottle. Never said a word to me. The really scary thing is she doesn't watch TV, no video games, no Facebook, no whatsapp, no Instagram, no phone. She doesn't even know song joong-ki. Keep it up. Sit up straight. Hello! I'm tse pok-man. Sorry! Quiet down! The principal is coming. Please take your seats. Hello, everyone! Welcome to our choir find your voice. This time we have 32 of you from tao tsun secondary school, Lee yiu ming memorial school and heep luen Chinese school. And we also have someone whose parents asked for permission to join from hua yan college, tse pok-man. Hello, everyone! My name is tse pok-man. What is a top school student doing here? I have also signed you up to compete as a special group, in 9 months at the school choir competition. What? Competition? Competition? Is there a prize? Are you shitting me? For real? Why do we have to join? I shouldn't have signed up. We're not going to any competition. Quiet! Quiet! We're very happy to have with us, the renowned Chinese conductor from the U.S., Mr. Joseph yim, as your instructor. Mr. yim has conducted 3 choirs - your instructor. - From famous universities in the U.S. He'll be teaching you. One of which has, for 3 years in a row, won the world university choir championship. Let's bring him on. Mr. yim! My name is Joseph yim. You may call me Mr. yim. I have gone through your files. I don't know what possessed you to show up here. As the saying goes, you didn't choose music, music chose you. Sir, I just want to say music didn't choose me. The director of student affairs did. He said if I sit through this program, he'll forget about all my demerits. Is that true? I was told I don't need to take any tests and will be considered a pass. Is that true? Quiet! If you don't even have the fortitude to sing one song well, you have no business here. You're free to go. I don't care. From now until the competition, we have 9 months. You must be prepared. If you're confident enough to stay, I'm confident enough to make you the champ. That's all for today. I'll see you all tomorrow. Goodbye, Mr. yim! I like him. He has character. More importantly, we think alike. We want to win. Of course! Mr. yim! Yes? Can I talk to you? Sure! Have a seat. I need you to help siu-lung. So he can stay with the choir. Please take good care of him. All the kids in here, I will do my best to coach them. But if you really want to help siu-lung, starting tomorrow until the day of the competition, don't come here again. Siu-lung is in secondary school. It's time for him to learn to take care of himself. I hope you'll understand. Siu-lung! Yes? Time for school. I know. Siu-lung, starting today, you go to school on your own. What? Today is your first day. Here's your finishing line and also the graduation ceremony of the choir. Let's get started. Today's training is to clean the classroom. What? We are just here for singing lessons. Begin! If you want to stay, mop the floor properly. A lisper can sing? Exactly! You're kidding me. What? My mom said I can sing very well. Hey! Where have I seen you before? Hua yan kid, so you're here to pick up chicks? My name is yeung ka-bik, I already have enough admirers. But... I have knockout buddies, you can add them as friends. I can give you their numbers. No, thanks. Wait! They're real lookers. Shit! Hypocrite! How did the cos go today? Show her the video. Great! Isn't that cool? I saw on taotao web, the sakura village street goddess 7.1 came out already. Hurry up and get it. I think they only have 2 left. I know. But I need to save up enough money first. I'm home. Dad! That's all? I gave you everything I have. Tell your boss to let you work longer hours. I can't. I already told you, the school put me in a choir. You haven't finished school. Who said you can sing? The teacher said if I don't, I must repeat one year. Then it'll take longer to graduate. You must graduate as soon as possible, get a job and help support this family. That means I can sing. Stop drinking. Have you thought about us? I don't know why I married you. I'm willing to tough it out with you, can you quit drinking? If you ask me, he acts so cool to cover up. That's awesome! They're really good. That's St. Adrian's college. Their choir has always been awesome. The best of all schools. Stop! Jason you're the captain and have been here the longest. How can you be the first to get distracted? If you don't want to be a 5-time champion, get the hell out! Sorry, Mr. suen! It's them. They call themselves hot air choir. You didn't come here to sing. You came here to clean. Hey, you... You sweep dead leaves with one hand. That's quite a skill. He's gifted. Tell me this... Do you know at what age a vocalist must learn to sing? 6 years old. 6 years old is the latest. How old are you? You can't be that ignorant. I have never heard of any age limits. One of the 4 greatest tenors in the world, Andrea bocelli went blind at the age of 12. After which he started learning to sing. He's world famous. You haven't heard of his story? Too bad. Shame on you. Excuse me. I have to go clean a window. Bravo, pok-man! Yeah! We're leaving, siu-lung. Bye! Dad! I stayed behind at school to finish my homework before I came home. But tomorrow morning, I am going to Shanghai. We'll talk after I replied this email. Where's my gold watch? And the few thousand dollars. What watch? You don't have it. Of course I do. Hey! Go ask the other woman! Hey! I already gave you everything. There's nothing left. You're crazy! I want money. "Under the lion rock" "there's more laughter than sighing" "life is full of joy" "but inevitably..." Take a break! Let's take five. I need to calm down too. A choir is about team spirit. Look at you. What are you doing? Get out, all of you! Look straight ahead. Out there is the finishing line of the choir. I don't need you to do it quickly, but do it together. I hope you can do it. You must do it. One chair, one voice. On your Mark! Again! Count out loud. Ready... Go! Do it again. Get up! Do it again. Count the beat. Do it loudly! Do it again. Mr. yim, this is how you teach them to sing? Unlike the kids from the key schools, you can't teach these kids anything. I'm not too sure either. If one day won't do it, try 10. If 10 days won't do it, try 100. They'll make progress. Give me time. 1212... Mr. chairman, how many choirs are qualified this time? We have 5 this year. How many judges do you have this year? We hired three. Will you be one of them? They won't need me. Who are the judges? Allow me to tell you later. Hello, Mr. chairman, I'm a reporter from the L.A. daily in the U.S. Reporter from the L.A. daily in the U.S. And now, we invite the chairman of the realty association of the western district, the director of heep luen Chinese school and chairman of the find your voice experimental program, Mr. law hok-kwan to share with us the idea behind this special choir. Director law, please! Helping young people has always been my mission. Within the eastern school district, we have three band 3 schools within the same district. Helping them set up a choir has always been my dream. Perhaps you'll wonder why I spent so much additional effort and money to help these problematic students. It's simple. They're worth it. Mr. yim! Mr. yim! Your reputation precedes you. Thank you for joining us today. I have the utmost respect for you. Teaching these students with such complicated backgrounds must be very difficult. I imagine it's close to impossible to have them behave and sing a song. A little. Hold on... Louis Louis come here! This is my cousin Louis suen. Under him, the St. Adrian's choir is a 4-time winner of the school choir competition. This is Mr. yim. Hello! Mr. yim, I'm so happy to see you. We have actually met. Perhaps I should say I have seen you before. Really? Where? Last time in L.A., about 6 months ago, at the most crucial competition for university choirs. Your San Francisco university choir was everyone's pick for the winner. We all thought you had it in the bag. I thought so too. But... You didn't make it to the top 3. What a shame! Where were you these past 6 months? Mr. chairman! Excuse me, reporters would like to take pictures of you. Can you please step outside? Sure! Let's take a picture. No, thanks. This way please. I'll see you later. Have you been drinking? I'm sorry. I think coming back was a mistake. When you realized you took the wrong turn, it's best to stop. How about... I give you tonight to make up your mind. Whatever you decide, I'm still grateful for your help. You may want to give up, but I won't. Shall we trade? We can choose our way of getting along with others. You can tell me, or choose not to. If you don't, you may be able to dodge the problem. But if you do, you may be able to solve it. I'll leave this here. Life is full of joy, but inevitably, there will be tears. We meet under the lion rock. At least, there's more laughter than sighing. Sit down. Hold your hands up. Inside your world, what do you see? There's a few more. Look! You said you don't need spending money. Don't you want a snack during recess? No need. I'm not hungry. I'm off to school now. Uncle chan! This is for you. Thanks! Uncle Sam's son, Jonathan, is in the same grade as yours. But he scores full marks in every subject. Why do you stop here, and don't work harder? In the future, you won't be competitive enough. Tomorrow, who knows if I'll have any work. Who knows if I'll get paid. And you! Stop wasting your money on those weird looking clothes. What a brat! Why are you so huffy? You're better off without a loser like him. You still have me. I can't do this alone anymore. I don't know how long I can keep this up. Before you learn to sing, I put you into 4 different parts. Soprano. Alto. Tenor. Bass. Let's begin. "What's more" "I need your love" "give me your love" "London bridge is falling down..." "Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping?" "London bridge is falling down... My fair lady" "we wish you a merry Christmas..." "I'm not unique” "go around the corner" "and I'll disappear" "the body goes numb" "the fist is trembling" you may begin. "Life is full of joy" "but inevitably there will be tears” "we're the rotten apples” "no one would pick" "to be enterprising” "it is too difficult" "talk about losers" "I'm the perfect example" "life has no hope" "the future is to hang by a rope" can she sing? You can start. "Amazing grace" "how sweet the sound" "that saved a wretch like me" that's awesome! That's awesome! A choir consists of 4 sections. These sections sing in Harmony without interfering with each other. Let's play a game called blowing in the wind. I'll put you into 4 groups and scatter you throughout this classroom. Your job is to count 4 beats, and start singing. Find your teammates from the same section. When you find each other, raise your hands. Shall I give you the first note? No. Good! "Now we are not afraid" "although we know there's much to fear" hey! Listen up! You're a choir, not a soloist. I want Harmony. Sing softly from the heart. Focus on finding your teammates. Carry on. "Now we are not afraid" "although we know there's much to fear" "we were moving mountains” "long before we knew we could" "who knows what miracles you can achieve" sing from the heart. "You can achieve" "when you believe" "somehow you will" alto. Bass. Tenor. Pick up the piece of paper. Take a deep breath. Hard isn't it? Because you did not use abdominal breathing. For most people one breath is about 500ml. If you use abdominal breathing and breathe like a doggie, you'll have 6 times more oxygen. Stop horsing around! Stop! Right here! What's wrong with you? How many times did I tell you? Libera me is a requiem. Western requiems are graceful and elegant. It's about aestheticism. They are sweet and beautiful. That's why even their tombs are gorgeous. Do you understand? Two fingers below your belly button. Not above. Where is your belly button? What does "dolce" mean? Jason! It means sweet, Mr. suen. Sweet, ok? What were you doing just now? Please do not desecrate the composer's work. Relax! Don't be so uptight. Hold the sheet higher. Let's do it again. Nobody leaves until you get this right. Take it easy. Control your breathing. No! Elegance! "I love to sing" stop! Ka-bik, pay attention. Again! "I love to sing" "I love to sing" "I love..." Ka-bik, put away the phone. Ka-bik, don't do this. "Frankie: Let's break up!" Get lost! You don't understand. I quit. I'm never singing again. Ka-bik! Why? Does it hurt? Can you tell me why you're doing this? I want someone to love me. Someone to care. I'm the middle child. My grades are the worst. I don't count. My younger sister in the elite class, told me not to tell anyone I'm her sister. I can never do anything right. The more I try, the worse it gets. Nobody really loves me. Why do you need other people's love to feel important and feel your own worth? That'll be very disturbing. Rather than relying on others to make you happy, why not learn to love yourself? Let's all chip in. Since I'm the oldest, it'll be my treat. Yeah! Bravo, Mr. yim! Thank you, Mr. yim! Mr. yim! Mr. yim! This is the 8th time you smiled. Really? Mr. yim! Your hair is messed up. A few strands are standing up. Mr. yim, you hair is messed up but you're still very cool. Hey... By the way... Let's start a group. So it's easier to stay in touch. Great! Great! I'm almost done. Everyone is here except miu lai and Mr. yim. Miu lai doesn't have a phone. I think you do. Really? Give it to us. Exactly! Come on! Miu lai! Come on! Yeah! She has a phone! Miu lai! I'm so happy. Mr. yim and everyone, it'll be windy. Wear your black jacket tomorrow. - I remember which piece. - So handsome. You look so cool. I already picked out the song for the school choir competition coming up in 3 months. I think this song is suitable for you. If you sing this song, you'll give it a different flavor. The name of the song is called "you raise me up". An english song? Not again. Queenie, pass them the lyrics. This harmonica is for you. I'll teach you later. Go for it. The lyrics. Goodbye, Mr. lo. Goodbye... What you're doing for these kids, is it worth it? Yes. No child should be left behind. "To chase my dream” "I take each step with confidence" "and never back off despite the wind and rain" "wherever I go" go! Hei-hei, go for it! "My dream will never change" you really think music has chosen... Us? "I strive to make myself stronger” wrap your hands around it. Yes... Loosen up the mouth. Relax! Yes... Relax! Let's start with the no. 8 chamber again. Open wide. That's right. Open wider. In the next couple of nights, a construction site will work through the night and need extra help. Who wants the job? Mel "passersby stare at me" "because of my odd appearance” "they don't understand” "ll have discerning eyes" "we all have our own ideals" "and strive towards our objectives” "I will use my laughter and songs" "to earn my soul mate's praise” "passersby stare at me" "because of my odd appearance” "they don't understand” "ll have discerning eyes" "we all have our own ideals" "and strive towards our objectives” "I will use my laughter and songs" "to earn my soul mate's praise” mom! Are you crying? When your dad in heaven hears you play, he'll be very happy. Good! I'll try my best to play it for him. "I have confidence and the flight at night won't faze me" "ll sing my own tune even when I'm tired" "I continue..." You're home early. Mom? Hei-hei, I want to go back to work. What do you think? That's great! I used to work with may in the beauty parlor. She called me yesterday. She opened a tiny shop and wanted to know if I have time to go help her out. The money is not much, but, I want to try. Mom, let me help you with that. Here... Get back in there! What is it? Get away from me! Since I was 7, I started fighting and stealing. And have been caught several times. I don't want that to happen to you. Please don't tell anyone. Please? Very well. Promise you won't steal again. Do we have a deal? Tenor! Alto! Soprano! Bass! 1212... "When I am down" "and oh my soul so weary" "when troubles come" "and my heart burdened be" "then I am still" "and wait here in the silence" "until you come” "and sit awhile with me" "you raise me up" "so I can stand on mountains” "you raise me up" "to walk on stormy seas” "I am strong" "when I am on your shoulders” "you raise me up" "to more than I can be" come and see. I have a cos next week, Mr. yim, are you coming? I'll see you all there. Up next, the statue of loy will bring us "looking for the long lost courage” Thank you everyone... And now... I'd like to invite my friends onto the stage and share their music with us. When I was down and out, one of their team members, wan yee, told me I didn't choose cosplay, cosplay chose me. I'm really grateful to her. Let's hear it from find your voice. Let's turn the stage over to them. We'll sing under the lion rock. "Life is full of joy" "but inevitably there will be tears” "we meet" "under the lion rock" "at least there's more laughter than sighing” "life is bound to be tough" "and worries are inevitable" we want cosplay! Get lost! Why does it turn out like that? Can anyone tell me what has happened? That was crazy! They are mobs! I can't watch it anymore! Stop it! Beat him! Get the police! They are fighting badly! Which schools are they from? Google them. 5,800 views, several hundred shares. Mr. yim, should we expel him? It's definitely wrong for kids to fight. Should we find out why? Who cares why? This Joseph yim is beginning to get on my nerves. What about plan b? Plan b is proceeding as planned. Don't show it to me. Just get it done. Of course... Good afternoon, class. Good afternoon, Mr. yim. Sit down. Shun-hei, stand up. I know you have been suspended. You can imagine fighting is a serious matter. Mr. yim, they threw bottles at us. Shun-hei helped us block them. That's right! They started it. It's their fault! Exactly! I would've beaten him up too if I were there. Just kidding. Exactly! They're pissed because we were singing. That's crazy! Unlike us, not everyone can see exactly what happened. What did they see? Shun-hei beat up someone. Mr. yim, he was helping us. Sit down. Nobody has the responsibility to get to know us, or the obligation to help us explain anything. You expect people to believe what we have done? What have you done? I checked with your school, Chinese, english and maths, you didn't even score 10 points in any subject. Conduct? Even worse. How do you expect anyone to believe you? Do something for yourself. I asked director law to give you a make-up exam. For all these subjects, you must score 70. Can you manage? Is this a joke? Asking him to score 70 is like telling him never to come back. My scores for these subjects don't add up to 70. Me neither! You want me to leave? Just say it. Quit your act. I'll go. Don't take that attitude with me. Losing you temper when shit happens, what's the use? You stood up for your friends and helped them fight. Will you stand up for him and tutor him? Will you? And you? Pok-man! Will you? I'll do it, Mr. yim. I'll help him. 70 is a piece of cake. I always have good grades. Starting today, I'll tutor you. You can do it. Nothing fazes us. Right? Shun-hei, I'll be rooting for you. Fung shun-hei, the bass team will support you. And the tenor team. And the alto team. And the soprano team. Shun-hei... Thanks, siu-lung. Here's your pay for today. Thanks! Pok-man, come here. Why were you hanging out with these kids? We're members of a choir. Stop dragging your feet. Go pack. You're going to england tomorrow. Everyone, I'm so sorry! Something came up and I must quit the choir. I must go to england tomorrow. I think I won't be back in Hong Kong any time soon. I don't want to go, but I had no choice. What? Out of the blue? Pok-man, please don't go. Why so sudden? We were doing so well together. Wait till after the competition. Who'll tutor me? Mr. yim, make pok-man stay. We'll work hard. Go for it! Go for it, pok-man! Missing you, pok-man! Mr. tse! Hi! Mr. yim! Have a seat. My son has never lied to me in his life. When I found out he wrote that letter to apply for the choir, and hang out with those misfits, I'm so shocked. He said he was curious at first, and now he can't bear to give it up. Mr. yim, I'm grateful you taught him to sing. After he goes to London, he'll follow my footsteps, enroll in the top high school, then Cambridge. That's the path he should take. I didn't realize after music has chosen pok-man, it would bring you so much trouble. I'm sorry. But pok-man really loves music. That's not a problem. He can decide after he gets his master's. He'll be more mature then. All parents think like that. Mr. yim, do you have kids? Mr. tse, is it possible... No! My wife and I have decided, leaving is best for pok-man. Ok! That's my cue. Wait! Pok-man pleaded with me for a long time. He said he needs to return something before he leaves. He's in his room. Go have a chat with him. Sure! Mr. yim! You wanted to see me? I'm sorry, Mr. yim. I'm returning the music. Your father is so eloquent, I stand no chance in dissuading him. One's most amazing achievement is none other than finding yourself and have the courage to be yourself. I believe in you. Wherever you are, find your voice. I want you to keep this for me. Goodbye, Mr. yim! Here he comes... Pok-man... Bye... Pok-man, bye... Take care! I'm so sorry! Pok-man! Shun-hei! You must... Bye! Go for it! Pok-man... Pok-man... Leave me alone! Mr. yim! Mr. yim, you're bleeding! You hit your head? What happened? I ran into him downstairs. He said he needed the money. He took my wallet. My money! I came to see your boss, fung wing-tao. I want to see your boss, fung wing-tao. What the hell? You're a debt collector? This place changed hands for a year. Tao went belly up. "In coma - day 3" W ater... Just now, my dad wouldn't let go of this picture. Your father is in trouble, just be there for him when he needs you. He's ok now and that's good enough. Mr. yim, I'm sorry. Do well on the exam. Cheer up! Ka-bik! Wan yee! Scoot over. Leave room for shun-hei. Sorry, miss tong. I'm leaving. Don't. Fung shun-hei, I heard you must score 70 in all 3 subjects to stay in the choir. Let me see. I'll help you. This is wrong. This one too. Do you want to go out with us for supper tonight? No thanks. I want to study in the library tonight. Ok, see you later. Bye, see you. I didn't give up. You shouldn't either. Though I'm not there with you, I'm with you in spirit. You must all work hard and sing my share as well. I can play do re mi. When you're back, I can do the whole song for you. I now have fans at my cos. Please root for me. Hello, Mr. tse, hi, how are you? Ok, so from the test results, what I also found is that he's really struggling in adjusting to tremendous pressure. Dad. I'm sorry to disappoint you again. I'll try very hard to catch up on my grades. Don't worry! Let's do it. You didn't choose music, music chose you. I'll be rooting for you. You must score 70! Pok-man - you can do it! Shun-hei, I really hope you can find your voice. Please don't die! Help! Try the tomato, mom! Thanks. I have never seen fung shun-hei awake during an exam. I pray that I can score 70 then I can stay in the choir. Yes! Mr. lo, we have the results. Mr. yim, I finished the exams. The results are inside. Read it to me. Chinese language, That is great! English language, Maths, 67... Did you leave out anything? Definitely! 67 plus 3, total score is 70. "Shun-hei: Pok-man, I did it!" "Pok-man: I knew you can do it. Miss you all." 1212... 1212... What are we? Find your voice! In a few more days, we'll be leaving. I think I'll miss this place. Have you thought about what will happen to you in a few years? It used to be after graduation, I wanted to get married right away. But now, I'm not that stupid. The world is so big, I have my dreams. I want to be a fashion designer. Good! I want to be the first person in Hong Kong to win an international cosplay competition. You can do it, having seen you in your last cos. What about you, shun-hei? I want to be an astronaut. Taking people to outer space so they can see this universe. An astronaut? Don't laugh, that's his dream. Want to be a singer. That's great! OMG, she's talking! We'll be your fans. I'll go see your concert. Don't forget to give us your autograph. Make sure you won't forget us. That's so cool! I won't. I knew she can sing. Hey! What are you doing here? Director law! Mr. yim, tsang siu-lung won't say anything. Can I have a word with him? What happened? Those things... I bought them. Mr. yim, I'm so sorry. Before this, I stole something. I felt really bad about it. I spent twice the money to buy back what I stole. Whatever is in the bag, I bought them with my own money. Please believe me, Mr. yim. It's true. I believe you. I hope you'll give siu-lung a chance. Director, if you ask me, these kids have no right to perform on stage. If you continue to defend them, it'll only compromise your reputation. That's why, I have a plan b. Just in case, anything should go sour, I'll implement my plan b. See for yourself. "You raise me up" listen to them. They're quite good. I know siu-lung made a big mistake. As his teacher, I didn't know about it until today. I believe I have a huge responsibility too. For that, I must apologize to you. Siu-lung truly wants to make amends. Why must we punish him? Instead of encourage him? From day one, this is precisely the reason we set up this choir. Why is it we're the one to give up on them here and now? Why? Director law, in any case, let them finish the competition. If you ask me, as the chairman, business is business. Say no more. My mind is made up. We'll go with plan b. Hey! What do you want now? Give them another chance. Mr. yim! I was so wrong about you. When you first came here, you were so cocky. You told the students you don't care. Look at you now. Director law, I know I failed to meet your standards. When a student commits an offense, the teacher should be held responsible. And I will. Fire me. Ok! It was your idea. You are fired. Please leave. Thank you. What are you afraid of? Look at that! This place is big! Don't call me mean, this outfit doesn't suit you. Look at your skirt! It looks like the curtains. You mean queenie? I think it's pretty. Unlike you, your skirt is filthy! Why doesn't your pants fit? Fall in! In 2 days, you'll be singing on this stage. The outcome of this competition is not important. This experience can give you confidence and courage to face the bigger stage later on in life. Confidence, courage, are qualities I have emphasized you must have. After spending time with you over the past 9 months, I think I don't measure up to you. I'm sorry. Perhaps since I was young, I didn't know how to relate to people. When something happened, I always lost my temper and blamed everyone around me. Sometimes I think if I played a different role, I can cover up for myself. In order to forget the pain, I chose to hurt myself. Let me just say this, I never allow myself to fail. But a little over a year ago, I suffered a setback. For this particular setback, I did not have the guts to face it. Because of it, I lost all my confidence. Since then, I took up drinking. Day or night didn't matter. All I did was drink and sleep. Sleep and drink. Then one day, I got completely blasted at a bar, I ran over someone in a car. I was terrified and hid in the suburbs in the U.S. I don't remember... I don't remember how much time has gone by. Then one day, Mr. lo found me. He told me on the phone, he wanted me to use music to help a bunch of kids, abandoned and forgotten. Some are good, some are bad. He said no child should be left behind. No child left behind. But I was contemptible enough to use this noble cause to delude myself. I told myself I was not running away. I always said, one's greatest achievement is finding himself and has the courage to be himself. Siu-lung is just a boy, but his behavior reminded me of the true meaning of courage and responsibility. I contacted the U.S. police and turned myself in. Within the next 48 hours, I must return to the U.S., which means I won't be able to join your graduation ceremony. I'm sorry. Believe in yourself. Believe in the others. I know they can tell you have grown up and they can see you're different from before. Believe in yourself. Believe in me. They lost their conductor, I'm counting on you, Mr. lo. You can still write with no hands. You can still walk with no legs. In this world, you can do without just about anything, all except one... Faith. I have to go. Fine! Even though Mr. yim can't be with us, we can't let him down. We'll show them all. We'll sing this song well. Deal? Deal! What are we? Find your voice! "The 39th interschool music competition 'tenor" "winner, Joseph yim from form 1A" "The best principal in the universe" "lo Kai-kwong, tao tsun secondary school" "Mr. lo, this trophy belongs to you."
