(Inauspicious music) Ah shit. So it came to pass... (Suspenseful music) (Screams) You fool. All you had to do is ask for it, I woulda given it to ya. Next time, it'll be your whole arm. Nobody robs anything from me. Stop the engine! Stop the engine! Oh shit, alligators! Alligators! There's a man overboard! Stop the motor! Stop the motor! Stop the motor! There's a man overboard. Hey look! I nailed that one. You nailed that one? It was my shot that got him, buddy! Bullshit, it was my shot. Hey! Hey, don't pull any harder than that, Goddamn it! Piranha. We tried. God be with him. (Shouts in foreign language) I'm not gonna rob you, But unless you move, you're gonna get wet. One drop and you're dessert. Your friend said I could have a drink. Go ahead. Thanks. Yeah. Who is that son of a bitch? Gringo the Damned. Or Gringo the Madman. Nobody seems to know, really. Lot of people think it was the whiskey. But I know it's what happened in there. He went into that jungle with five Of his friends looking for gold. Six years later, he came back alone, Wild-eyed, mad, a man who didn't know his own name. He was clutching to a bag of loot. And he wouldn't let go. What was inside the sack? Gold? No. Five shrunken heads of his friends. Shrunken, like that. (Spirited music) What do you think, are we getting warm? Maybe. We've been flying these jungles for six months And all you can give me is a maybe? I'm beginning to wonder if there's Any oil down there to begin with. Lookie there! What the hell are you doing? Would you forget the damn bird? We got a lot of jungle to cover. [Clark] Coming in at four o'clock. The invincible Red Baron on the tail Of the elusive Lone Eagle. Oh I got him! One in the wing, one in the gut! Total one more hit for the Red Baron. I've got an idea! No. You haven't heard it yet. Yeah, but I know your idea. [Clark] Oh, this'll appeal to your spirit of adventure. [Dick] That I seriously doubt. But let's hear it. [Clark] If I cut off his tail with the prop, I win. If I miss, you win. What do I win? I'll back off, give you a clear field with Barbara. Back off? Why, you conceited bastard! You know Barbara's my girl. All right, burn her here, pal! She was my idea in the first place. [Clark] Things change! She and I have been getting the hots for each other. [Dick] Have you been making out With my girl behind my back? Woo hoo! Shit! (Laughing) Oh what are you beefing about? He got away, you won the bet. [Dick] Some bet! I get to keep what was mine in the first place, And damn near get killed in the process. You think you can put her down right there? I wanna take some samples. OK, here we go. Well, I've got a feeling that this is our lucky day. If you say so, buddy. This place looks like the lost continent. A guy makes a wrong turn in here and he can forget it. One more time, what makes you think That there's oil in a place like this? Look it's bubbling out all by itself in Mexico and Venezuela, and it's here too! (Puma roars) Whoa! You stupid son of a bitch! Hi Pat! This is a nice surprise. Communications equipment at camp is out again. I came because I've got some news for the boys. I'm afraid they're not here. No big problem. I'll just leave it with you, and I'll get going. Well, come up to the house, let me fix you a drink. And you can tell me what's going on. I'd say, I could sure use one, kid. But with the radio out, I got a lot of stops to make. OK, well, what's going on. What's this "big news" you have? The company did not renew the contract, And I've had orders to scrap the operation immediately. You mean... We can go home? We can get out of this hell hole? That's right, kid. Of course, the boys will be paid as per their contract And if they want to they can continue With the company in Venezuela. If they go, that trip they make without me. I'm going back to air conditioning, TV, and dressing up. This time I'm not gonna move. So don't crowd me. It makes me nervous and start knocking things down. Don't worry, my friend. Just wanna talk. I don't wanna talk. I think you talk too much. And here's a good place to get your tongue cut out. All right, don't talk. Just listen. I know you'll be interested. Here, have one of mine. My name is Zafata, Pablo Zafata My friend is Jairo, Jairo Vicia. He likes to think of himself as a Mexican. But he's a chicano. An American, just like you and me. We found out that your into shafting the natives. Well, let's say that you trade, you get along with them. We've got some good bucks. We need to hire a couple of them. We need some guys. We'll tell them we're going hunting, But what we're hunting for is gonna be our secret. Your secret, huh? You got gold written all over you. Let me tell you something, pal. The only thing you're gonna get Out of that jungle is a long walk through hell. Long and slow. Hey friend, how about another drink? Shit. Well, let me fill you in, Gringo. Iron ion cherry. We've been working mines together In Montana and Colorado, we're experts. Yeah. Sounds to me like you had a good thing going. Why don't you go back to it. You know where the gold is. Your friend, he talks too much. I don't like anybody mouthing off about my business. I told you it was a good place to get your tongue cut out. You fucking idiots, do you think If I knew where the gold was, I'd be trading Trinkets with the indians for nickels and dimes? Do you know what's down there below, Gringo? No, and I don't give a shit. Well, we're not alone. This bucket is full of mining equipment. All that gear down there must mean Someone is on for a very good strike. We've been following those crates since we left shore. Those boxes are going to a Klaus von Blantz. Mr. Klaus? Mr. Klaus? My machete. Tacho's men. Two are behind us. Three are in front of us. What do they want? (Speaking Spanish) They welcome us to the fiesta of Giamuricuma. Thank them for their invitation, but, uh... Tell them that we have supplies to pick up on the docks And that we cannot accept. I don't like their moods. It's better to go to talk to Tacho in person. You wait here. Mama Morinba! Mama Morinba! Don't touch them. Nobody can touch them but me. They are my daughters. Yes, they are our daughters, But they are now my wives. Where is that Nazi? He's not a Nazi. Just because he's a German doesn't make him a Nazi. I know your German very well. I know about his Luger, he treasures it. And that he knows how to use it very well. Probably someday he's gonna use it To put holes in those beautiful breasts of yours. Tell him that I have been waiting for him to pay the taxes, Otherwise to bring me something of value. You know, I have been very good to him. You were my beautiful wife and I gave you to him. I hope you haven't forgot. Someday, you will be sorry for that. I'm not sorry for anything that I do. And I have no patience. But you know what I can do. And you know, what I can do. (Laughing) Hey do you know what this is? It looks like some kind of bone. Yeah, it could be human. Oh hell, it could be anything. It's probably a big monkey. Still it could be human. We'll check it out later. Listen, boss, if we wanna keep our bones in our skin, We'd better get back before we lose the light. Yeah, we've picked up enough things for one day. Dick, my genius, what are you trying to say. What we've found is... Crystallized carbon. Is that a diamond? [Dick] Yes, it is, my dear! Of the purest and finest quality. It's beautiful. But what does it mean to us? It could mean everything! You see, that rock was buried right next to this bone, A human shoulder bone, So we figured the two go together. If we keep digging, we're not only Gonna come up with the rest of this skeleton, But Dick thinks a big stash of those stones. OK. Count me in. But if we don't come up with it pretty fast, We're going home. Let's pop the champagne and celebrate That we may get very, very rich. Oh yeah! Where the hell is the booze? [Dick] Look at you two! Come here, baby. Is she gonna dance? She's gonna dance! (Screaming) The legend is that, many years ago, The men of this area went off on a fishing expedition. They were gone for a very long time. Whatever happened turned them into Wild, vicious, beast-like men. When they returned the women were terrified Of them and fled into the jungle. They became warriors in order to defend themselves. And this riverboat in this village Was named after Francisco Oriano. He had encountered these women warriors. In honor of them, he named this whole area the Amazon. Well, hey, Gringo! How about a bet? I go for the one with the big ass. A fight like that, nobody wins. I'll take you in that bet, Jairo. I pick the one with the big chiches. (Speaking Spanish) A few of those girls are gonna stay here, As my guests. What is he doing? What's that? Good snake. No thank you. (Shouting in foreign language) The ritual is over. With a wife like that, you don't need a watchdog. Hey Gringo! Aren't you coming ashore? No, I take care of my business right here. Hey, listen. I don't care what you think, But we haven't hooked this bastard. And as soon as he's finished shafting These dumb gooks, he's gonna turn and he's gonna leave, I'm telling you. What else can we do? We've gotta keep our eyes on those crates. We'll let von Klaus lead us to Wherever we wanna go. Meanwhile, let's check in at Zimba's. I can't wait to see that truck there wait for us. What are you doing with my things? You're hauling a lot of gear, Klaus. You going on a treasure hunt? Keep your nose out of my affairs. Otherwise you get it blown off. It's none of your business where I'm going! I'm not so sure about that. I've got a long memory. I have a long memory too. And I remember you, Gringo! And I remember that every time I see you It brings bad luck. You show up where you don't belong, You'll have all the bad luck you need. Put that gun away. I've seen guns before. I've killed many Yanks with this gun. Yeah, I know about your war record, Klaus. I also know what a big man you were in a concentration camp. Let me tell you, I never killed a Nazi before, But it's not too late to start. You keep out of my way, Gringo. Very far out of my way. [Jairo] OK, OK... You know, I'm the only authority in this town, So I make the rules. And I expect that every guest in this hotel, Has to follow them. Now, in this side, is for women. And on this other side, that one, is for men. And remember, no peeping allowed. And you must also remember, That the women have the preference for the lavatories. But you don't have to worry, Because we have no women now. Well, good, because after seeing Those tigers fight out there, that suits me just fine. Hey, Tacho! You have room for me? Hi Gringo! For the Gringo, there is always room. How many are you, Gringo? Oh, just me. These guys, they're my partners, We're doing business. It's better to have partners than enemies, right? Now your using that old cabeza, partner. [Pablo] Look at that Kraut move. He sure as hell doesn't want any company. Yeah, they know we're on to them. They wanna beat us to the gold. They're running scared, you see, You can feel it! [Gringo] Yeah, fear is the shadow of wealth. Hey Gringo, what made you change your mind? I did. That's all you gotta know. Oh yeah. Then how come, all of a sudden, You decided to trust us? Trust you? Yeah. I don't have to trust you. You gotta trust me! You couldn't get into that jungle without me. You sure as hell can't get out without me. So just remember that. Well, I still think we should Be following the stormtrooper, there. You wanna follow him, go ahead. You mean, you're not gonna follow him? I don't know what the Kraut is up to Or where he's going. I just know by his animals, He's going the long way around the jungle, And up the side of the sierras. But that's not the way I'm going. Oh yeah, and what the hell are you gonna do, fly? We're going into the jungle right here. And then we're crossing the swamps with Ganuz. It's the fastest, but it's the most dangerous. Not even the Hiperoos'll go there. And what are the odds of making it, do you know? Why, are you scared? No, I'm not scared. If it's a big take, I'm not scared. Big take? Why, you poor suckers, you don't know what big is. You know what it is? It's the Emerald City, The jackpot at the end of the rainbow. Big? Why, it's so big, it's gonna knock Your eyeballs right out of their sockets. It's the treasure of the Amazon. That's how big it is. These two skeletons have one thing in common: No skulls. These folks were trophies for head hunters all right. This one doesn't show a skull either. The loss of my head may be no great loss to the world, But I would find it a definite inconvenience. Hey, I think we got something! Have we got something? I knew it! I knew it! Easy, easy, easy! Let's dig up this entire area, Very, very carefully. How many? These folks must have found a mine. They were probably carrying a fortune. Yeah, And it cost them their lives. Oh Barbara, would you come of it? We are about to become very, very rich! How much do you think one of these stones is worth? I don't know what the market is. But a bunch of these would be worth more money Than people ever see in a lifetime. We'll be living like royalty the rest of our days. (Howling) Why, Gringo, I understand that you And the German are going after gold. If so, I think it would be smart of you to tell me. Otherwise, you know what can happen. We told you, we're going hunting. Yeah, and we paid a lot of money for All of this crap, so I don't think we have to Answer to any more questions, do we? It is my duty to find out about any foreigners, Adventurer, pirate, or leech who enters into my country, What they intend to do. There are thiefs who would steal natural richness, So you must understand that I have the right To confiscate everything that's not declared. So good luck to you, my friends. Don't worry. All we're gonna do is hunt. Do anything you want in that jungle. You can tear your eyes out. But if you find something of value, You have to declare it. Don't sweat it, Tacho. We're not gonna cheat you or your government. I'm glad you understand, Gringo. But if you want to go back to civilization, You have to come through here again. My men are silent, but very efficient. It would be a pity that suddenly, You should find yourself with fishhooks Through your tongue, hanging up from a tree. Well, have another drink on the house, huh? We're doing this together. And I wanna earn my share. I've made up my mind. I'm gonna stay. (Howling) There's that noise again. It sounds like somebody screaming. Ah, there's a kind of monkey that makes noises like that. There's no need to worry. What the hell are you doing? Noise! That's noise! Scare away that howling monkey, the way it scared us. Next time your gonna shoot, warn us! You almost frightened me to death! Let them follow the tracks. One more step and I shoot. Morinba! Ask them why they are following us And who sent them. (Speaking Spanish) Tacho sent them. They work for him. Ask them have any soldiers arrived. (Speaking Spanish) No, there are no soldiers in a long time. Tell them to stop following us. If I see them again, I will shoot them. (Speaking Spanish) (Pigs squealing and grunting) (Dramatic music) You know something? It wasn't until I saw Clark take off That I became afraid of this place. That plane was our last and only link with civilization. How did you ever talk these indians Into bringing us into this swamp Inside these funny caskets? I don't even understand how these damn things can float! You'll see a lot of things in the jungle You don't understand. As far as the natives go, they're friends. I buy their feathers from them. I don't cheat them, they trust me. What did you offer them this time, Gringo? Your heads. Our heads? I told them that the Jivaros Would pay a big price for them. Eh, listen, I don't think you're being Very funny, you know that? What's the matter, Jairo? You getting nervous? Let me tell you, if either one of these two natives Thought that there were the Jivaro within Five miles of this place, they'd long be gone. I got a feeling you're as scared as anybody. Yeah, well, I got my reasons. Hey. [Pablo] Watch it, Gringo. Yeah, what's the idea? That's part of the deal I made with them. I said they could have all the skins of the gators We shoot along the way. Part of their wages. Hey, that's the German! Oh shit. We're not gonna stop for no fucking alligators. Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is India Echo Zulu, over. Mayday, mayday, mayday! This is India, Echo, Zulu, over. Who the hell is gonna hear? (Screaming) (Shouting) Come on, get over here, come on. It's all right, it's all right, all right. It's over. It's all right. I imagined just about anything could Happen in this jungle, but damn. Not bats! I can still hear them in my head. Horrible little squeaks. Oh, damn you, Gringo. Why did you have to bring us to this stinking marsh? I'm not spending another night Hanging from no tree, you know that? Well, if you'd rather spend it in the belly Of a crocodile, well that's OK with me. You'd better start worrying about finding that gold! Because if we don't find it, it's not Gonna be so nice for you either. Jairo's right there, you know, Gringo. You'd better worry about finding the gold. That's the only thing we're not gonna find here. Now you better start talking some sense, friend. 'Cause we ain't playing, you see? Neither am I. What are you trying to pull? What are you trying to pull? Why did you bring us this way then? For something else. Something more valuable. What the hell are you talking about? A real treasure. Not those gold nuggets, but a whole river. A whole natural river of diamonds The size of your eyes. Hey! Hey! Aquí! Aquí! [Gringo] I'm afraid you guys are gonna Have to get out and fucking pull. Look out for the crocks! All right. [Jairo] Come on. (Jungle sounds) (Howling) (Speaking Spanish) Dick? Dick! Is that you? Dick! It's me! What's the matter? Are you all right? What happened? I heard steps. I thought it was you. I found a cave over here, we'll be safe there. I'll come back for the rest of our things later, come on. Come on! Let's go! I don't think anyone could have followed us here. I feel safer here, more than the town. This is the only place where I can get sleep. We won't have much time for sleep. We must get whatever we can out of this mine, As quickly as possible. We can spend the rest of our lives working here. We just take what we need to live on. Then we will go. I don't want others to know the incredible wealth We have at our disposal. That way they'll think we failed. Or that we didn't find much. I will come back for more, later. What do you mean, "you will come back?" You said we are going to share, remember? Half of everything is mine. Yes, I know. I know, Marinba, but, um... What would you do with all of that money? I know you think about your people, But I think about the entire world. I don't care the entire world. You don't understand. I have men in Argentina waiting for me, Waiting to build a new world, And revive the glories of the Third Reich! You could be part of that world. You are obedient, like a doberman. What is a doberman? A very intelligent dog, with incredibly sharp hearing... I never heard you laugh before. So what is so funny? Because you look like a dog to me. (Speaking foreign language) What's wrong? What's he trying to say? He said he saw a deer right over there. That's good, they never come down to the swamp. That means we've passed the first stage. Good. Good, 'cause I can't stand this fucking place any longer. Or him, for that matter. Well, let's keep on moving. I wanna take a leak bad. And I wanna take a leak on dry land. Ha, ha, on dry land? Well, I better go see to our supplies and equipment. Suppose, I mean, just suppose, Clark doesn't make it back. What'll we do? Hope to God there's another way out of here. Don't worry, kid. I'm scared, too. Look, I need to get there in a hurry, Don't you understand? I told you three times, this is not an airplane. Be patient. If only there was some way to let them know. Here! Take it! Take it all. Here this is twenty, thirty, thirty-three bucks, And I tell you what, I'll even throw in a pretty good watch. Now what do you say? All of a sudden, I felt surrounded. I started shooting and I ran. My God, you're hurt! Quick, get the dart out! They use koari! Come on, it's a poison that can kill. Come on, let's go back! What the hell did you do that for? I shot the other one, he was trying To get away with our stuff. What the hell are you looking at me like that for? Don't you believe me? Why should we believe you, Jairo? From now on, you're gonna be doing his work. You're gonna carry the gear. Oh yeah? Says who? Says me! Because I'm carrying the Joe around here. That's what you think, you lousy jungle rat. Because here each man looks out for himself. All right, Jairo, cut it out. This time Gringo is right. You better your gun away. So now you're on his side, Zapata? Yeah. It's not a question of taking sides, pal. We came here to do something. Now the only way we can get it done is to hang in together. Now you're gonna do what I tell you to do, You get it? You are crazy. You're crazy! What did you want me to do? The guy was trying to get away with our stuff! (Laughing) He's right, you know. Each one of us is supposed to look after ourself. Yeah. You sons of bitches! How about a smoke? All right. Get me out of here! OK, Jairo, all right. All right, come on, come on. Bullshit! You've always been able to come up with miracles before, Why not now? Two people could be dead, you know. Listen, Clark, I know how you feel. I really do. But you know there is no damned hydroplane. You have the only one in the area. I sent for the parts you need, and with any kind of luck, You'll have it this week, I promise. That could be too late. (Mumbling) Damned diamonds! [Pablo] Look out for those planes, Jairo. [Jairo] Screw off! You try carrying this shit for a little while. [Pablo] Well that's what you get for being trigger happy. [Jairo] Screw off! [Gringo] Come on. Patomayo indians. They look very young, but don't let that fool you. They fight their own wars and eat the flesh Off the bones of their victims. And you see those necklaces, huh? Yeah. Those are the teeth of the ones they've killed. Oh geez. [Gringo] Quiet. This better be a big monster of a treasure, Gringo, Because I'm being eaten alive! Clark! Clark's back! We can get out of here! Clark! Clark! It looks like somebody beat us to the party. Could that be the Kraut? How the hell did he get here that fast? Well, he's gonna leave here a lot faster. 'Cause I didn't go through all this shit for nothing. Clark! Drop that rifle! Drop it! Oh, no, no! I don't where we are anymore. I don't know if we're getting closer or farther away. Well, you're doing fine. You're going back exactly the same way you came. Come on. Hey, what do you think? Not bad. I'm not talking about the dame. I'm talking about the line about The diamonds and the river and her friends. I don't like it. It seems like a setup to me. A setup? Yeah. For what? I don't know. Remember, nobody knew we were coming here. There it is! (Screams) Hey Gringo! You're wasting your time. You better take a shot of what's left of the ice, kid. It's too late, huh. You guys have probably picked the best ones out of there. Nothing left for me probably, right? That's right! That's right, Gringo! I guess Zapata and I are the lucky ones. Well, what can you do? I wanna thank you guys for doing my work for me though. Hey, hey, ho, what are you talking about? Well, we're partners, right? That means we cut it in four equal parts. What? We split four ways? You're fucking crazy, man. Hey, the woman, she's entitled to a part, too, isn't she? She brought us here. That makes four of us. Four equal splits. Listen, Gringo, all these rocks I took are mine. I pulled them out. And I ain't gonna split it with anybody, you know? Oh, you're gonna split em. And so will you, Jairo. Oh yeah, and if we don't, who's gonna make us? You, Gringo? You know, you think like a loser. You'll always be a loser. Hey, just because you got the diamonds in your hand That doesn't mean you're gonna get to keep 'em. You gotta get out of this jungle to spend it, don't you? Well, how you gonna do it without me? Huh? So, you guys better do what I tell you to do. Well, we are gonna get outta here without you. We'll find a way. And you and that girl better come and pull out your own, 'Cause I ain't sharing nothing. Listen, Gringo, there's two of us against one. Two of us. And if we have to use a gun to make you lead us out of here, We're gonna do it. Yeah, we're gonna do it. OK, then we all die. I've had it right up to here. From now on, you two guys are on your own. Don't count on me. Ha ha, don't count on me! Do you buy that? Nah, he's only bluffing. He's trying to scare us so we have to Split our loot with him. You understand? Ah, put the gun down, lady. You're gonna have to get used to me. I'm gonna look around. In the meantime, you decide whether You wanna hang around and see who gets here first, Your pilot friend or the Jivaro. Or you can go back with me. Hey baby, why don't you take your clothes off And jump in here and play with Jairo and me, eh? (Laughing) Because you already dirtied the water, pig. Pig? Pig, ha, you're a pig, did you hear that? You're a pig! Yeah, I'm a pig. [Jairo] You're a fucking pig! All right. Hey, don't look at me like that. Listen, I don't want you to be scared of me. I want us to be friends. Friends? Oh, your hands so soft. So smooth and beautiful. Instead mine, look, mine, their like... Like rocks. Yeah. They are. You'll be OK, you'll be OK, don't worry. You know what, I'm gonna take care of you. You know, if only I hadn't come across that animal there, 'Cause I woulda come across a lady like you. Well, I would have had at least 12 kisses. One for each month of the year. It's never too late to get what you want. That's right. The important thing is knowing how to wait. Yeah, I know, I know. And that's the problem, you see. I never had enough patience. Hey, what's wrong with you? Eh, nothing. Nothing. I'm leaving. You're leaving? Hey, relax, we're all gonna get out of here together As soon as we clear out the ice box. I already told you, you guys are on your own. He's crazy. Well, he looks like he saw the devil himself. And look at the woman, she's gone! You know why she's gone? Because you're a pig! Gringo! Gringo! Hey, Gringo, I'm coming with ya. I gotta get out of this damned jungle. Please don't leave me here. Just simmer down, simmer down, will you now? My God, listen, I think what you need is a drink, huh? I got the good stuff here. Hey the rafts! It's the only way out of here. If Gringo takes them, we're as good as dead. Let's go! What, are you crazy? We're never gonna get another chance like this! Well I have enough. Well, I ain't leaving until I get double of what I got. OK. You stay and I go. No, you stay and I go. (Gun safety clicks) You'd shoot me for the glass, wouldn't you? That's right. Now you'd do the same thing. Yeah, I guess so. But I'm glad you pulled out the gun, friend. It kind of takes the load off my back. Hey. I always took you for a double crosser, Jairo. (Howling) What happened? I heard a scream by the river. Jivaros! Do they know that we are here? I don't know. Very well, let us prepare ourselves for their visit. Hey, hey, please, please, for Christ's sake, Don't leave me like this, shoot me! No, Jairo. I couldn't shoot a friend point blank. Oh, shit, come on! Hey, hey, Zapata! Hey, don't leave me here like this! I'm gonna get you, motherfucker! I'm your friend! You double-crossed me! Don't leave me like this, shoot me! You double-crosser. I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you, you fucker. (Crying) Oh shit! I can't go on. I have to rest. OK, OK, OK. Over by those trees, come. Barbara, wake up! Hey, come on, get up. I've fixed us a little breakfast. Mmm, come on. It's good for you, it's gonna be a long day. You're gonna need it. There you go. Mmm, it's good. Sausage? No, snake. Mmm, delicious, huh? I caught him just before he was ready to bite you. I'm sorry. I'm not hungry. Hi! Well, well, well, look what we have here. Our lambs have come back to papa. Jairo decided to stay. Oh, he did, did he? Yeah. He must want those diamonds real bad. Maybe he can trade his head for 'em, huh? Well, it's his head, so I guess it's his problem. (Intense music) Oh shit! (Screaming) (Explosion) (Rapid-fire gunshots) Oh! There it is! Damn you, Gringo, you're a fucking genius! Right on the money! All right! I never make a promise I can't keep. I told you I was gonna get you out of this place. Well, I am! But you gotta hold up your end of the deal! All right, all right. You'll get your share of the diamonds. From now on, we share everything we've got. Starting with her. (Screaming) Hey Gringo, help me with this wildcat! I'm not in favour of that violence. Yeah, but she might be worth it, huh? (Gunshot) Mr. Klaus, piranhas! It has piranha's again. We only cross if we sacrifice an animal. I must protect the interests of the mine. I knew you would, you dog. You son of a bitch, now where is it? Oh, got it! Oh, oh, that figures! You got his too, huh? Hello, my friend. I hope you have found what you were looking for. Unfortunately, no. We were attacked by savages. They killed Marinba. I had to come back. I hope you are telling me the truth. It is in you to lie, in order not to pay taxes. But you must know, we have a very Unfriendly form of punishment for liars. Did you find the gold? No, no, I told you, no, I had to come back. What is this? That is sand. Sand? Yes, it's sand. I am taking samples to analyze them. I don't think you need so many bags to be analyzed. I hope you are not thinking that I'm a god-damned fool. And what is this, you son of a bitch? Leeches! [Gringo] What? Huge leeches! Leeches? All right, all right, here. Pull them out by the head. By the head. Klaus von Blantz, In the moment before ashes return to ashes, And dust to dust, Ask the Lord for forgiveness and repent. Repent for sins you have committed against him, So that you may have forgiveness for all eternity. I repent nothing! My Fuhrer wanted to cleanse this Earth of a poison, And create a race of men that would glorify all mankind. Heil Hitler. Now that we are all in faith with God, This is your share for the taxes, Padre. In the name of the Holy Father, and the needy, I thank you. (Thunder) Ha ha, Gringo, my friend! I'm happy you have returned. But you give me a tremendous surprise, eh? I thought you were coming back with the other two, And you come with her. But let me congratulate you, my friend. I think it was a very intelligent change. Did you find the gold? No. Are you sure? I said no. All right, before you say no again, I have something to show you. (Speaking Spanish) (Screaming) That happened to him because he was lying. Besides, he was bad, he didn't want to pay the taxes. It's easy, if you don't want to happen The same thing to you, why don't you tell the truth? Did you find gold? I already said, no. I'm just trying to help you, sir. It's so much better to be on the side of the law. I'm gonna repeat, did you find gold? Gringo, please, we've been through enough hell. I couldn't take anymore. Why don't you just tell him? All right, all right. I found these. They're probably worthless, but... She's a smart lady. She told the truth, so she's free. But not you. I think you're stupid and you lie. You're wrong, fat man. You asked about gold, I said no. That's all I found. You're a very smart man. You didn't lie, you told the truth. But you also fibbed. These are yours. The rest will be for the government. You asleep? No. There's something I wanna show you. Yeah, I gotta surprise, a surprise I wanna show you. Wait, just you wait and see. Look at this. Worth a fortune! Those jokers, they thought I was kidding back there. We were gonna split it four ways. There's only two of us now, So you get half of it and I get half of it. You wanna help me spend my half? Huh, yeah? Yeah, we'll catch a big bird, get out Of this jungle and go to New York. Check in at one of those fancy hotels. Walk down Fifth Avenue and do some window shopping And buy you some fancy dresses And me some new duds and... And then we'll walk into one of those fancy restaurants, Those French ones and we'll order up the whole menu. No snake. No, no, no snake, no. Caviar and champagne, and then we'll travel around the world And see all the wonders. Just you and me, just you and me together. It's sounds wonderful! Well, I can't wait to get started. (Singing) Stop, stop the boat! (Speaking Spanish) They told me in town you were on this boat, I couldn't believe it! Here, come to papa, you sweet thing! Come on, let's get the hell outta here. Hey, what the hell is that? (Dramatic music)
