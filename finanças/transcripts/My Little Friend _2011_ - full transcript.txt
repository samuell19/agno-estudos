(music) (bouncing ball) (music) (running) (music) (bouncing ball) (screaming) (giggling) Emily:Oh my God! (laughing) Amy:Oh my God! Emily:Oh my God. Amy:Yeah, we - No, we're out of the - We're out of the fish. Yeah. No more fish. Oh you did? Oh. Well we're getting a shipment in next week. So I would come in then, early next week. Yep. You got it. I mean feel free to come in today. We still have lots of sea creature stuff. We're open until 5:00. Yeah, come on in. Okay. Great. Okay. Bye. (beep) Amy:Hey, sorry! Emily:Oh, no. Amy:Oh gosh. Emily:My God, look at you. You look amazing. Look at this blonde hair. I love it. Amy:Wow. You look so cute. Emily:Oh thanks. Amy:Oh man. Emily:You too. Oh my God, what's new? Amy:Uh, well this is my work. This is where I work. Emily:It's beautiful. Amy:Yeah, I sell my art in the back. Emily:No way. Amy:Yeah it's really - It's cool. Emily:Oh my God. Amy:What about you? What's going on? Emily:Well, kind of been going down that path. I was an actor in New York. Amy:Well, yeah of course. You were doing that in high school and stuff. Emily:Yeah, yeah. So I continued it in New York. That's over now so I was happy to be back. Amy:Were you like on Broadway and stuff like that? Emily:Um, I didn't quite make it that far, but - (laughing) Amy:Oh whatever. Emily:Oh my God. We have to hang out all the time and catch up. Amy:I know. I know. Um, are you available right now? Are you open? Emily:Um, yeah well I just got back a week ago, and I've just been trying to get acclimated. So, it's so good to see a familiar face. Amy:I know. I know. I'm so glad. And you e-mailed me your number. I apologize. I didn't get back to you. (phone ringing) Emily:No. No problem. You're busy. Amy:Hold on one second. Emily:Oh yeah, yeah. Amy:Sorry. (phone ringing) Hello? Yeah, can you hold? Yeah, okay thanks. Um, let me give you this. This is my work number. Emily:Okay. Amy:Call me tomorrow and we'll try to hang out tomorrow night maybe? Emily:Awesome. Amy:Okay. Emily:It's so good to see you. Amy:It's so good to see you. Thanks for coming in. Emily:Oh my God of course. Amy:Yeah, okay. Emily:Bye, bye. Amy:Bye. Hello? Thanks for holding. Hello? I can't - I can't hear you. Hello? (thud) (moving papers around) (music) (squeaking chair) (flipping through book) Amy:Oh, ow. Do you know who I saw a year ago? Emily:Who? Amy:Coach Jared. Emily:Wait, how do I know that name? Amy:B-ball baby. Emily:I knew it. Oh my God. What is he doing? Amy:Well, not saying b-ball baby anymore. Remember he used to say that. Amy & Emily:It's b-ball baby. (laughing) Amy:It was so cute. Like, thinking about it now it was really, really cheesy, but that was so cool. It got me so - Emily:Pumped. Amy:It got me so excited. Emily:Yes. Amy:And I was like, "Yes, it is b-ball baby." Yes. (laughing) It was so fun. Emily:Oh my God. I have not played since I left. Amy:Yeah, same here. I'd be really rusty. Emily:Me too. Amy:But he's kind of lost his damn mind. So, I feel like we should practice a little, call him up and be like - Emily:Are you crazy? Amy:Am I crazy? Emily:Watch us play? Amy:Get those gym shorts out. Get your water bottle. (music) (shuffling papers) (closing drawer) (people talking) Amy:Down it girl. Emily:Yeah. Uh-oh. Amy:I'm going to do my Emily impression. (laughing) It's you. You're so serious. Emily:And I'm going to do Emily's boyfriend impression just grab your ass. (laughing) Amy:Stick into the back pocket. (laughing) Emily:Yes. Amy:Looking for spare change. Emily:I know. (laughing) (laughing) Oh, those days. Amy:You look really good. Emily:Awe, thanks lady. So, do you. Amy:Well thanks. You do though. You're so pretty. Emily:Girl you got rhythm. Amy:This song is so good. Emily:Too bad I took my heels off because I used to be taller than you. Amy:I know. This is natural though. Emily:Oh yea. Amy:Hey you want to take a nap? Emily:Okay, I'll take a nap. Amy:Let's take a nap. There we go. Emily:Oh man, I wish like Boyz II Men was playing or like K-Ci and JoJo. Amy:Oh my gosh. Emily:Then it'd be real. Amy:This is real baby. This is real right here. Emily:Then it'd be perfect. (laughing) Oh that's right. Sorry. We got too close. Amy:Oh gosh. Emily:Hands on the collarbones. (laughing) Amy:And then there was this. Emily:Oh yeah. (laughing) Like all of a sudden you're like, "But I don't want to be that close to you." Amy:I feel your boner. (laughing) And it's weird. Emily:And it's weird. Luckily we won't have that problem tonight. Amy:Oh gosh I thought [unintelligible]. Sorry. (laughing) Emily:Okay. (laughing) (light music) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (phone vibrating) (light music) Amy:Oh. Hey. Emily:What? Amy:Baby called. Emily:33 missed calls? (sighs) (birds) It's just amazing because it's just like we're best friends all over again after being best friends 10 years ago. Charlie:Okay, that's great. Listen, I know you ignored my phone call. Emily:What? Charlie:Because I called and it only rang twice. Emily:So? Charlie:So that means you pressed ignore. You ignored Charlie's phone call. Emily:I did not. Charlie:Yes, you did. Poor Charlie, sitting at home in my underwear, doing nothing, had nobody to play with. Emily:Babe, we were just out having fun. Charlie:I called you like 33 times. I don't care if you were having fun. I was scared. I was nervous. I don't know. Maybe - We're close to the ocean, maybe you could have - Maybe some Somalian pirates docked you know and they took you hostage. How am I supposed to know? I'm sorry. I just - I'm glad you met your friend again. That's good. (kiss) (light music) Emily:Baby, can you put this one on the top one? Charlie:Yeah, of course. That's what you keep me around for, huh? Emily:And this one too? Charlie:For, uh, the high shelf and changing the light bulbs. Emily:That's true. (kiss) Charlie:Our house is coming together. Emily:I know. Charlie:I love it. Emily:I love it too. Charlie:Wish it wasn't light blue, but uh - Emily:(laughing) We can always paint it. Charlie:I'm not painting it. I'm way too lazy for that. Emily:You'll get over it. At least we have a house right? Charlie:Yeah. Emily:I never thought I'd say that. Charlie:You've got to thank your dad for that one. Jesus. Emily:I know. Charlie:Um, so Amy, tell me about Amy. Amy:Who's Amy? I'm Amy. I live with my dad, still, after 26 years. (light music) I'm an artist. I sell my art, and my dad is a historian. He loves history of everything. He knows the history of our neighbors, ancestors. He knows the history of the school down the street. He knows everything about everything. And he definitely knows the history of me and Emily. (light music) I remember seeing Emily in class and not knowing who she was, and it was art class and we had to draw our pets and she felt really awkward because she didn't have any pet to draw. And, you know, I told her that she could, she could draw my cat Lady who had run away and when I described what she looked like Emily drew it so perfectly it looked just like her and that's when we became friends. She kind of brought my cat back. (light music) I remember Mrs. Allen, she would get so mad at us though because we started to draw these really really graphic stupid things on the side when we were supposed to be working on our planet project and we really just did not want to draw planets. We wanted to draw funny, gross things in our little journals, and we would be laughing so hard. We would be crying and shaking and we'd get in so much trouble. I mean really, who is Emily? Who is she now? (siren) (light music) (street sounds) (light music) Emily:You know what my mom told me about Bank of America? Amy:Hmm? Emily:Well, first of all you know how they got bailed out? Amy:Mm-hmm. Emily:So, they got bailed out but still only pay their tellers like $8.00 an hour, something like really low. Then, they found this loophole where the health insurance that their employees get is the Husky Program in Connecticut so it's tax payer funded. So Bank of America found a way to not pay for their employee's health insurance. Like the taxpayers are paying for it. Amy:Are you serious? Emily:Yeah, so my mom's union, she works for the State of Connecticut for the Education Department. Amy:Right. Emily:Her union is like, they're all getting together and they're like withdraw your accounts from Bank of America. My mom's like, "Well, Bank of America always worked for me, but ..." Like, knowing that makes me sick. You know? Amy:Oh my God. Emily:It's just like the things that are going on now - And these companies that got bailed out, there's no what's the word? Restriction or - Well there's like no restrictions on them at all. No rules. They can just do whatever they want. They can find loopholes everywhere. It's really frustrating. (light music) (fire) I mean it's tough. Local elections are tough. Not a lot of people vote. Amy:That's true. Emily:But you know it makes me think that now that I'm back here, maybe that was kind of a sign that I saw that today. Because it's like the first thing since I've been back that really inspired me and like if this is where I've chosen to live then I should be involved, and yeah the acting thing didn't work out but I can be passionate about something else. And there's just so much going on in this country right now that it's like why not start locally? Amy:Well, okay. Would you be interested in working for my dad? Emily:Your dad? Amy:Yeah. Emily:Wait, at the museum? Amy:Yeah. Yeah. I think I could totally land you a job there. Now, I don't know - I feel really bad that I didn't think of this sooner, but I think they're definitely looking for an intern and a paid intern probably. Emily:Really? Amy:Yeah. Absolutely. I'll let him know. I mean I can't promise anything, but I'm pretty sure that they're looking for that. I mean that would be a really great opportunity for just being involved in something that isn't so corporate or something stale like working at a grocery store. You know? (fire crackling) (light music) Dad:So, this painting behind you by Childe Hassam, he's an example of an American impressionist. So, he's painting at the same time that Cezanne, Degas, Monet, Manet, all those people are painting in Europe, but he painted at the Isles of Shoals. You know Appledore Island out there and Celia Thaxter had that artist colony and that's a particularly beautiful one. My brother bought it in Boston, gave it to my mother and she died 20 years ago. She was the founder of the Rye Historical Society. So, he let me have it to bring it up here. And it's served many purposes up here, but it just reminds me though, losing my mother the Society almost died after she died in the early 90s and then Bonnie Goodwin who is a charter member of the Society - This picture was taken in '85. She and I kind of worked together and we just kept plugging away, did a few programs in the library, and then finally this building became available and it was from like 1995. Got moved in '97 over here and it finally opened in '02. So, it took me seven years from the first idea that we were going to get it until we actually opened. But she oversaw the whole thing, you know and got the people to come in and do the work and what a difference that made. But then we lost her early. She was only 66. About five years ago and then her husband who was a big help to us, he died in '08 and then we lost our treasurer and our secretary. So, we need you Emily. Emily:Oh gosh. Okay. Dad:We need you because there's - You know, so - So, how do you think you could help us? Emily:Well, I'm very good in the office. Dad:Good. Emily:Good, I can type 50 words a minute. Dad:Okay. Emily:And I know Excel and Word and Outlook, and so I definitely am good at data entry so if that's what you're looking for, like I'm great at that. Dad:We have a special software called Past Perfect, which is unique for museums. So, if you know how to do all that then you can learn how to do this. Emily:Okay. Okay great. Dad:Because I'm a Luddite. I just send e-mails and write Word documents, but that's why we need somebody who could go in and - I can actually pull it up on the computer, but to actually scan things in and organize it and you have to put session numbers and all this stuff, you know. Emily:All right. Dad:I don't know, but you'll figure it out and there are a lot of resource people to call upon to do it. Emily:Oh good. Okay. Dad:Anyway. Emily:Thanks. Dad:I'm just trying to think. Yeah, this is just business stuff and then - Yeah, I've got to clean up the mess. (laughing) (footsteps) (opening fridge) (pouring) Dad:So, we thought it would be cool when people came into the museum if they would have something interesting to see rather than just that logo over there. So, we have this wonderful old cradle, and you can tell that somebody has, for a long time, been using their foot because this is so worn. So, they could sit and read, talk and rock the baby by just going like this and came from a house right up here so that's got real Rye significance and these dolls came from Rye in the 1800s. So we've got the cradle thing, you know birth, beginning of life and then we thought well what the hell, cradle to grave. This is the entry gate to one of the old 60 plus graveyards of Rye, and Louise Tolman one of our great town historical workers she rescued it from this falling down graveyard and I don't know how. She must have pushed it end over end, got it into somebody's barn and then my wife and I rescued it and we got it to our place and she oiled it up and I got my carpenter friend and we put it up here. Emily:Wow. Dad:So, you come in and in this museum you're going to get everything from cradle to grave. (laughing) Charlie:Hey. Hi. Yeah. No I'm just having a glass of water. What are you doing? Cool. Where's Dad at? Oh. (laughing) That's good. I guess you know we should all be on the diabetes diet. No, she's out. Yeah. She's - Well she's at her new job. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah she's got this friend Amy, her dad hired her. He works at a museum. Yeah, I don't know. I'm not going to work at the same place she does. No. That's ridiculous. I don't think I'd get sick of her, but I just think it would be weird. Uh, God. Listen, no. It's fine. I have some money saved up anyway. I - Before we left I went to Atlantic City. I took my last $100 and I made $300 so I have $400. So I'm not worried for the next week or two. Things are cheaper here anyway. Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I know. I'm going to get a job. Anyway, hey, hey. I've got to go. There's this light bulb's making a weird noise above me. Yeah. I'm going to try to fix it before Emily gets home. Yeah, this house, I tell you what, this house is beautiful but it gives me the heebie jeebies. (light music) (chair creaking) (phone vibrating) Emily:Hey. Yeah, good. How are you? Good, thanks yeah I'm still here. Um, I'm probably going out with Amy tonight. Yeah. Well there's stuff in the fridge. Okay, well I'm at work so I should go. Okay? All right. Yeah, love you too. Bye. Amy:Hello? Hey. How's it going? Emily:Good. Uh, what are we doing tonight? Amy:Um, I'll be out - I'll be out in a little bit. You want to meet me down here? We'll go to the Pressroom or something. Emily:Oh, okay. Yeah, that's great. Okay, what time? Perfect. Amy:All right. I'll see you later. Okay, bye. Dad:So Emily how are things going? Emily:Oh, pretty good thanks. Dad:Good. Good. Emily:Yeah. Dad:Oh, burnt house. (laughing) Yeah, we document everything in Rye. Emily:Amazing. Dad:Yeah. She's the head of the friends of the library and so she tore that house down after it burned and built a beautiful bigger house. (laughing) Emily:Jeeze. Wow. That's huge. Dad:Yeah. Emily:I can't believe she built a bigger house. Dad:Yeah, that's on the most exclusive road in town. Sea Road. (laughing) Emily:I got it. This is my house. (footsteps) Oh my God. I have to take these heels off. Amy:Let me get them. Emily:Oh thank you. Amy:Let me get it. Emily:Don't fall. No, I got the other one. I got the other one. Just go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. (thud) (light music) (creaking floor) (light music) Charlie:Oh, hey. Hi. Um, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up? Amy:No, no. Just heading out. Charlie:Oh okay. You're Amy right? Amy:Yeah. Yeah. Charlie:Amy, hi. Amy:Hey. Charlie:Charlie. Amy:Charlie, nice to meet you. Charlie:Yeah. Nice to meet you too. Amy:Great. I'm sure I'll see you again. Charlie:Would you like mint tea? Amy:No, I'm set. Thank you though. Appreciate it. Charlie:We have coffee or - Amy:I'm all set. Thank you. I'm good. Charlie:Well, drive safe. Emily:I'm going to kill myself. Charlie:Don't do that. Emily:Will you rub my head, babe? Charlie:Yeah, sure. Emily:Why do I do this to myself? Charlie:You're a boozehound. Emily:(groan) (kiss) Emily:Where's Amy? Charlie:Oh you mean that weirdo that darted out of here the minute she saw me? Emily:You're talking very loudly. Charlie:Sorry. (laughing) She left at like 8:30 or something. Emily:Wait was she weird? What happened? Charlie:I lost my page. Emily:You're supposed to be rubbing my head. Charlie:Oh, sorry. Okay. Here you go. Emily:Thank you. Charlie:No, I don't know. I just was like, I asked if she wanted some tea and she like threw her clothes on and left. Emily:Oh, well she probably felt as shitty as I do. Charlie:Yeah, I thought maybe she was embarassed I was in my skivvies. (laughing) (jumping) (panting) (belch) Emily:Oh my God. Charlie:Don't puke. Emily:That's Chinese. (panting and jumping) Charlie:Is it better to go slow? Emily:Go at your pace. I mean you go your own pace. (laughing) (panting) (jumping) Charlie:See, all it takes is like ten minutes of missionary position and that would have been a better workout. Been a lot more fun. Emily:(negative sound) Charlie:Yeah. Emily:We would not burn this many calories. Charlie:Want a bet? We could - Come on. Emily:I'm getting a cramp. Charlie:Yeah, me too. (footsteps) Charlie:Here you go. Emily:Thank you. Emily:Hey. Charlie:Oh, how embarrassing. Emily:Okay, to our new house. Charlie:Our new house, which we still need to christen with sweet love. Emily:That's what this is for. Charlie:That's what this - (laughing) Perfect. You have to be drunk to make sweet love to me? Emily:You know that's not true. (laughing) Emily:All right, and our future. Okay, we're drinking. Charlie:I'm drinking. I already got started. Emily:Ah, New Hampshire wine. Charlie:Yeah, it's good. Emily:Not bad. Could get used to it. Charlie:Yeah. (laughing) Think we're going to be here for a while? Emily:I don't know. What do you think? Charlie:I don't know. I hope so. I like it. It's nice. Emily:Good. Charlie:I think I should become a sailor or something. Emily:Yeah. Charlie:Wouldn't that be cool? (laughing) I don't think I could do any actual, like manly sailing, but maybe if I did something like with a whale watching tour guide or something. Emily:Oh, that'd be so cute. (kiss) Charlie:Don't be so sensitve. Emily:Your a little whale watcher. Charlie:Yeah. (sighs) Emily:I can't believe we own a house. Charlie:Yeah. I know. We are going to be in a lot of debt, if the bank doesn't take it away from us before we finish unpacking. Emily:My dad took care of a lot of it. Charlie:I know. That was really nice of him. Well, your mom said when we were leaving their place, she was asking me about grandkids. Emily:Oh yeah? Charlie:Yeah. Emily:Of course she was. Charlie:Yeah. She definitely wants some. (laughing) Emily:In our own time mom. Charlie:I know that's what I was thinking. We can practice right? (laughing) Emily:Yeah. (kissing) Thanks for coming here with me. Charlie:Of course. Thanks for sticking by me. (laughing) I'm just a jobless outdoor stage crewman. (laughing) Emily:Who I love very much. Charlie:What the hell kind of job am I going to get? Emily:I don't know. The future is yours. Charlie:Yeah, I guess so. Emily:A whole new place, a whole new plan. Charlie:To the future. To the future. I wish we were European. We'd be so much cooler. Emily:I know. [unintelligible]. Amy:Please. Thank you very much. Please do. What were you saying? Emily:Oh, I was going to say you met Charlie at my house the other day? Amy:Yeah, I guess. Kind of an informal meet. Emily:I should have probably warned you. Amy:No. Oh no I mean I knew he like - I mean I heard someone clearing their throat and moving around and it clearly was not you. Emily:I'm sorry I put you in that position. Amy:Oh, I didn't mind. I just felt bad because I was hopping out in my wifebeater without my bra. (laughing) Emily:Well you probably didn't expect a guy to be in the house, so I'm sorry about that. Amy:No, I didn't mind. It was actually very funny. Emily:Okay. Amy:More so afterwards when I'd had a coffee. Emily:Okay. Amy:Why do I have to keep processing which number is bigger? What is going on with me? Emily:Hopefully he was cordial. Amy:He was. Emily:Not too - Amy:He offered me tea or something. Emily:Oh he did? Amy:Yeah, it was really sweet. Emily:Good. I was hoping he wouldn't get like neurotic or anything. (laughing) Amy:Well he seemed - I felt that because I had to scoot out of there and he was just, he was funny. He seems like a nervous guy. (laughing) Emily:He's nervous yeah. Amy:He's cute. Emily:That's a good word for it. Amy:How long have you guys been together? Emily:Oh God, like two years. Amy:Wow. That's a long time. Emily:I think he's doing okay up here. Amy:Yeah? Emily:Yeah, I don't think it really mattered to him where we lived, but I don't know. He just got a job the other day so I think that will help. Amy:Yeah, that's good. Emily:Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. So, is everything okay with him lately? Amy:Mm-hmm. He's good. Emily:Good. Amy:He really likes you a lot. Emily:Good. Amy:He was talking and he was like - He's like she's just so grown up. I'm like well yeah it's been 10 years. Emily:That's so cute. Amy:It is really cute. I was like I know dad she's blossomed to a woman. Emily:Oh. Amy:You have. It's so amazing. Emily:He looks good though. I haven't seen him in 10 years and he looks almost the same. Dad:Oh this is what we do. We'd stop and buy wine and then all the different cheese and vegetables and bread and we would stop and have a picnic. Picnic. Amy:Picnic. Dad:It was your typical road. You'd have to wait for the cows. (laughing) Look at that countryside it's just beautiful. Amy:That looks good. Look at all the brie cheese. Dad:Oh yeah. Amy:Oh! Dad:Oh, that's the best picture of you in France. Look at that. (laughing) That nailed it. (people talking) (light music) Paul:How you doing guy? Charlie:Hey man. I'm Charlie. Paul:How's it going? Paul. Charlie:Oh, hey Paul. Um, do you think my coats okay out there? Paul:Yeah, sure. Everybody keeps their coat out there. Charlie:There's like this - I don't know if he's a fisherman or something. He's kind of a shifty guy. Paul:That's Ted. He's our security guy. Charlie:Oh, all right cool. Um, hey could I get a vodka tonic? Paul:Sure, yeah no problem. Charlie:Thank you. Paul:So you live around here? What's - Charlie:Oh, yeah. Yeah. We just moved here my girlfriend and I. Paul:Oh, yeah? From where? Charlie:From New York actually. Paul:Oh, nice. Charlie:Yeah. Paul:How's it up there? How's the weather? Charlie:It's good. It's good. Hey, do you know who those girls are? Paul:Oh that's Amy. Amy and Kristen. Charlie:Yeah? Paul:They're around here a lot. Charlie:Shh, don't say it so loud. Lesbians? Paul:Yeah. Charlie:Oh. The blonde is Amy? Paul:Yeah, that's Amy. Charlie:Hm, uh, hm. What do I owe you? Paul:That'll be $10. Charlie:Okay. $10? For this thing? Paul:Yep. Charlie:Are you serious? Paul:It's a vodka soda. Charlie:Is there some local fee or something? Paul:Yeah, if you were here earlier for happy hour. Charlie:I've got $8.00. Is that okay? Paul:No, it's $10. Charlie:Oh, wait hold on another $5. Okay. Paul:All right. Charlie:Charge less, maybe you'll get a tip next time, huh? (light music) I don't think girls should wear all that makeup. Emily:I don't wear a lot of makeup. Charlie:I know. I just don't think girls should wear any makeup. Emily:Well, I agree with you, but society thinks otherwise. Charlie:So, who cares? Facebook cares? Emily:Hollywood cares. Charlie:Hollywood. I get all my fashion tips from Bollywood. (laughing) Emily:That's clear. Charlie:Where you guys going? Emily:I don't know yet. I think we're going to decide when we get down there. Charlie:I want to make a baby with you. Like, I think we should have a baby. Emily:Yeah? Charlie:Yeah. Emily:Hmm. How long you been thinking about this? Charlie:I don't know. I guess I don't know. I just decided. Emily:Just now? Charlie:Yeah. Well, you know I was thinking about it and I thought well, I'd like to have somebody to hang out with here that I know. I'm going to know my own baby. (laughing) Emily:I'm not enough for you? Charlie:No, you're fine, but you're always out. You've got friends here you know? Emily:Well, you can come too. Charlie:I'm not going to go out. Emily:Why not? Charlie:Because I'm going to be home thinking about making a baby with you. Baby. Emily:So you can have a little friend? Charlie:Don't you want to make babies with this body? Emily:Of course I do. Charlie:Look at these genes. Emily:Look at them. Charlie:Come on. Emily:Right now? Charlie:Right now. (moaning) I want to have a baby with you. I do. Emily:We'll talk about it later. Charlie:I think we should talk about it now. (moaning) Amy's a lesbian. Emily:What? Charlie:Your friend Amy is a lesbian. Emily:How do you know that? Charlie:I saw her at the bar last night with some girl. They were making out. So, I asked the bartender if he knew them. I asked him, I said, "Is that Amy?" You know? Is that girl Amy? And he said, "Yeah." So then they were leaving and so I decided to follow them, and I followed them out near their car and they were kissing some more and they got in the car and left. I don't know what's going on with you, and with her or whatever, but I just thought you should know that. I'm sorry. Blonde woman:So how've you been? Amy:I'm okay. Blonde woman:I've been thinking about you. Amy:Awe, that's sweet. Blonde woman:Oh, I mean I just want to make sure you know, you're good and everything and I kind of wish I was there with you just to keep you company. Amy:I know. I know. I wish you were here too. Yeah, I mean it's pretty much the same. Blonde woman:Yeah? Amy:Like what? I think I talked to you last week sometime. Yeah. Blonde woman:Yeah, I don't - I mean I just don't like that because then it just makes it harder for both of you to move on. You know and it's just got to be hard, still talking to her. Like, do you guys act like nothing's really different or is she sad? Amy:Yeah. I mean she - Blonde woman:Hard man. Amy:I try to act really normal and she is just - It's just, you know, she's sort of needy. Blonde woman:Yeah? Amy:Yeah. I mean you remember. She was always kind of like that, but now it's just heightened because I've made myself slightly unavailable. I feel like I'm juggling a bunch of bitches. Blonde woman:(laughing) Oh my sis. The pimp. Amy:I know. The pimp. I don't really mean that. That sounded bad. Blonde woman:No it didn't. It sounded awesome. Amy:Okay good. (laughing) Blonde woman:I'm juggling bastards. Amy:Baskets? What'd you say? (laughing) Blonde woman:Not baskets. Bastards. (laughing) (light music) Emily:Oh my God. [unintelligible]. Why do you walk so fucking fast Amy? Amy:I'm not walking fast at all. Emily:Amy! Amy:What? Emily:You walk so fast. Amy:No. What are you doing? No. Whoa. No. No. No. Emily:Let's go. Open the door. (flipping door handle) Amy:You're going to have to hold on. Okay? Emily:It's fucking cold. (sighs) Did you see the lobsters? They're hilarious. (light music) (laughing) Emily:I got it. (light music) Amy:What? (kiss) (footsteps) (sliding door) Amy:Hey did I wake you? Okay. I just wanted to say goodnight. You going to bed? Okay. All right. Have a good day tomorrow. Okay. Thanks. All right. Soon. Okay. (laugh) Okay. All right. (laugh) Okay bye. (windchimes) (light music) (water running) (brushing teeth) Emily:Hey. Amy:Hey. Emily:Um, I'm going to go so I just wanted to say goodbye. Amy:All right. See you. Emily:Okay, I'll see you later. (hammering) (windchimes) Dad:What you're looking at is the beginning of the 1600s and so obviously those aren't photographs there, but they're paintings of some of the people who would have been here, old maps and aerial photos and so those are kind of the 1600s and then you get over in here maybe into the early 1700s and they're just artifacts and stories which I wrote a couple of years ago and then we found the images to put with these stories, and some people actually stop and take the time to read them, but the project that you could work on is we need to make a catalogue of this because people are more likely to read these if they could buy it. Emily:Oh, okay. Dad:Take the stories with them with some pictures. Emily:Perfect. Dad:So, there's another project. Emily:Okay, great. Dad:And which, you couldn't put all these pictures in, but you could put selective pictures. Maybe figure out which images. Obviously you want to try to - We could reduce these maps here. Emily:Right, yeah. Dad:They might be able to fit in, and then - But there's no reason why we couldn't put all those stories in because they don't take up that much room. Emily:Okay. Dad:And then just certain selected images that we think would be cool to have with it and we have the introduction around the corner, which says Rye on the rocks. So, that could be the front page or something like that. Emily:Okay. Dad:Yeah. Emily:Oh great. That will be fun. Dad:Yeah. (solemn music) (people talking) Kristen:Your hair is getting so long. Amy:I know, I need to trim it. It's all in my face. You look really nice. Kristen:Thanks. Um, so can I take you to dinner on Thursday? Amy:Oh wow. That's really nice. Um, I don't see why not. Sure. Kristen:Cool. Amy:I don't really know if I'm working, but I don't think I would be. I don't usually work on those nights, but I just want to double check. Kristen:Yeah, I mean whatever. Whatever. Next week. Amy:Next, next Thursday. Kristen:I mean this Thursday or - Amy:Oh, this - Yeah. Right. (laughing) Amy:That'd be nice. Oh where do you - Do you have a place in mind? Did you want me to think of a place or - Kristen:Whatever you want. Wherever you want. You pick. Think about it. Think. Think about it and let me know. Amy:Okay. (laughing) Kristen:I'll make a reservation. Amy:That sounds good, thank you for doing that. That would be fun. Yeah. I'll let you - I can let you know like tomorrow or something if I can do that. Kristen:Okay. Amy:Okay. (phone vibrating) Kristen:Uh, so - I had fun last time I saw you. (laughing) Amy:Oh yeah. Wow. I had fun too. Kristen:I mean I did too, but whatever. Amy:Yeah. Okay that was strange. No, but - Yeah it was a night. It was like old times. Kristen:Like old times. Not that old. Amy:Yeah I know. We sound like geezers. Dinner should be fun though. That will be good. Kristen:Yeah. Amy:I'll have to think of a fun place. Kristen:Somewhere cozy. Amy:Cozy? Kristen:Do you need to step outside and make a call or something? Amy:No. No I'm sorry. Kristen:Okay. Amy:My sister, she keeps writing me. Kristen:How's Shannon? Amy:She's good. Kristen:Yeah? You just seem distracted. Amy:I know. It's really rude of me. I'm sorry. Is that new? Kristen:Yeah. Um, look at me. I feel like - I feel like we're not on the same page or something. Amy:No I'm here. I'm listening. I'm sorry about the phone. I'm sorry. Kristen:That's fine. Amy:I'm here. Kristen:Okay. Amy:I'll let you know about dinner. Kristen:Yeah. Amy:I'll think of a place. That will be good right? Kristen:Yeah, maybe we can dress up or something. Amy:Mm-hmm. Emily:Amy it's me, can you please just call me back? Please, soon when you get this. Okay, bye. (solemn music) Dad:What's going on? Amy:Not much really. Just talking. Dad:Yeah? Amy:Mm-hmm. That's pretty much it though. Dad:Hmm. Amy:That's pretty much how I'm going to keep it for a little bit. Dad:So, nothing else about Kristen, huh? Just yacking? Amy:Just yacking. That's it. Dad:That's not very interesting. It certainly isn't informative. (laughing) I mean what the hell? Amy:I know. Dad:That was a nonanswer. Amy:I know. Well, I don't know what to say. There's nothing. Nope. That's it. Dad:Okay. Dad:You haven't responded to this. Amy:I want your pistachios. Dad:Oh, I thought you wanted to hold my hand. You wanted a pistachio. Here you go. (laughing) This is really what I wanted to show you. Check this out. Amy:That's not me is it? (laughing) Dad:That's a card you can send somebody but you don't think I'm going to send that to anybody. That's too cool. (laughing) Amy:Oh my God. That's so wrong. (laughing) Where'd you get this? Dad:Oh, I don't know but when I saw it, I said that's a keeper. Amy:Little chubby feet. Oh that is. Oh my God. I can't look at that for very long. (laughing) That makes me uncomfortable. (laughing) Dad:Oh, they're little kids. They're innocent. Amy:Yeah, but still. Dad:Yeah, but before long they won't be innocent. Right? Okay. Yeah I know. Amy:I think those little kids are big kids now. (shower) (squeaking knobs) (trash can opening and closing) (running water) (shower curtain) (kiss) (solemn music) (footsteps) (creaking floorboards) Emily:Charlie. I kissed Amy. Charlie:You kissed her? (laughing) Emily:I just wanted to tell you. Charlie:Did you have sex with her? Emily:No. No. (laughing) Charlie:Don't act so shocked. I saw her. She has an exgirlfriend. Okay? It's a perfectly legitimate thing to ask. Emily:Okay well. No. Charlie:But you kissed her. Emily:Yeah. Charlie:You sure you didn't have sex with her? Emily:Yeah. Charlie:Did you want to have sex with her? Emily:Charlie stop it. I told you I kissed her. That's it. Charlie:Did you want to have sex with her? Answer, just answer me. Did you want to have sex with her? Emily:Stop asking me that. Charlie:Well just say yes or no. Clearly I want to know. Look at me in the eye. Yes or no. Emily:I don't know. Charlie:You don't know if you had sex with her? Or if you wanted to have sex with her. That's a huge difference right there. Emily:Stop it. Charlie:Tell me. No, tell me. Yes or no? Did you want to have sex with her? Did you have sex with her? Emily:No! Charlie:Okay, you had sex with Amy. Great. Emily:No I didn't! Charlie:You had sex. Emily:No I didn't. I kissed her that was it. Charlie:Did you want to have sex with her? Emily:I don't know! Charlie:You don't know if you wanted to have sex with her? That's huge. That's crazy. It's one thing if you kissed her. Okay? That's one thing. But if you don't know if you wanted to have sex with her - When you were kissing her did you think about me at all? Emily:Oh, God. Stop it. Charlie:No, tell me. I want to know. Did I run across your mind or did you forget about little Charlie and his little light blue house? Just hanging out by himself. Did you forget about me? Emily:No. Charlie:Did you forget about me? While you were contemplating whether or not you wanted to have sex with her. Did I exist in your mind at all? You know, it's not the fourth grade anymore. She's not your little friend. You guys are big girls now. (door creaking) (footsteps) (door opening and closing) (footsteps) Emily:Amy. I've been calling you all week. What's the deal? Who's that girl? Who's the girl? How could you hide her from me? Just tell me. Amy, tell me. Amy. Come on. I know okay. Just tell me. Who is she? Amy:So, after you left I came out of the closet to everybody but you weren't here. Two weeks ago I broke up with my girlfriend of three years, Kristen. That's that. Do you want dates? Do you want? Emily:No, I want to know why you didn't tell me before. Amy:I don't know. I can't answer that. I didn't. I didn't. Emily:What? You don't trust me? Amy:It's not that I don't trust you. I haven't seen you in 10 years. A lot has happened, and I'm telling you now. Emily:So, what am I supposed to do now? (talking to dog) (bouncing ball) (groan) (bouncing ball) Amy:Oh. Ow. (bouncing ball) (groan) (laughing) (footsteps) (light music)
