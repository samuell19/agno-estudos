Murakami? - What is it today? - To get back my rejected manuscript. For you. You don't have to... Thank you. It's over there. Inside the box with the latest date. - May I? - Yes. Mr. Mizumoto said you should rewrite it. He's concerned about you. No... - I'm back. - You're back. Hello. Hello. -Oh? - From him. Oh. Mr. Murakami. Are those flowers for me? Or for Mitsuko? For no one in particular. Smells nice. Freesias. They smell nice. Don't go after Mitsuko. She has someone definite. - Sorry. - No! It's not definite. You stopped going to blind dates. He's not the one? You talk on the phone all day! My folks got so excited. But aren't you two excited? - Hello. - Welcome back. - Murakami? - Yes. Still writing? That one you sent me... you should rewrite it. Make the second half tighter. No. I'll write a new one. Bye. Sorry, Tetsuaki! I'm so sorry! Never mind. Don't worry about it. No, Soseki! Out. OK! That's it for today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tetsuaki. You've missed too many rehearsals lately. Sorry. But I've just quit my job. - I'll be back from tomorrow. - This is not for fun! I know, Mr. Koten! I envy you, you live for literature, but that's where you end up. Of course not. I want to dance with you as soon as possible. Will you go on the next tour with us? But will you let me join you? It depends on you. Our weakest link. So cold! Tetsuaki, Toshio. Please clean this place. - Yes, Mrs. Koten. - Smells nice! Fumi, let's play! It's curry. Sunao, what is that ltoga Trio tape you told me about? A live performance at the university. 10 years ago. Great playing. His nostalgia. Shut up! Hey guys. I want you to hear this. - Please hear it. - What is it? I'm thinking of inviting toga Trio to join us next time. It's Sunday, but Dad has to finish his work. How I long to eat this! This has become the only thing on my mind. Delicious! You want to eat peaches in this season, Mom. You're like a kid. - Tetsuaki! - Why not? Just a slice. Stupid boy. For you. - What is this? - Take it. Thank you! - Why? - From your dad. He's worried you won't get on without his allowance. I'm OK this month. He told us to buy you a sweater. I picked this. Like it? Very nice. It's OK. He should do as he says, "Take care of yourself first!" I'm still not successful. "Don't over-exert yourself." Don't say that. Tetsuaki. Your classmates are all working hard. Some even got married and have kids. You just want to write novels. I know! I know! Be quiet, both of you. Love on the Road by Tetsuaki Murakami So noisy! "Ichiro is getting married?" "Congratulations." The neighbours said that to me. How should I answer? I feel so shameful going out. I know... you went and registered your marriage. Hello, Big Author! Hi. We're living so close to each other. Even if you're not having an easy life, you could at least send me some food! Waseda Publishing. I'm Murakami. Oh, Mr. Murakami? Are you alone? Nakayama went to an author's place. Well... you've been helping me a lot, may I... buy you dinner? - I have a bit of money. -0h? Me and Nakayama? You. Both of us. OK. Let's go for a drink. Can you... - come alone? - Both of us. You completed a new novel? Still writing it. There's a lot to write. - Excuse me? - Yes? - A bottle of beer. - Yes. One bottle of beer! A young man fell in love with a girl. He wanted to ask her out, but he was broke and lived in a small room. There was a park in the town, with a lot of roses. There were benches and tables, it was a good place. The young man invited her to a picnic and waited for her in the park. He prepared wine and sandwiches, and waited for her. The girl brought cake? She didn't come. Perhaps she saw him from afar and left. But he kept waiting. Roses were blooming and it got darker and darker. The wind got chillier. That's the one you're writing? No, this just comes to my mind. I don't write such sweet books. The story is good. This is just a flash in my mind. I want to write stronger novels. Don't stare at people like that. I heard you're getting married. - Yes. - Congratulations. He works in a top company. His salary is high, and he's very nice. I can't ask for more, but something's missing. I know I'm asking for something impossible. Then marry me. I simply have nothing. What? Will there be such a woman... who has an income and wants a husband? I'l be successful. I'm a good investment. We don't have to get married, just live together. You'll be a bachelor for life. It's hot. Let's go somewhere else. I can't stay much longer. He's waiting for you? My parents. They don't want me to get home late. They'll lock the doors. It's like a dream. It's different every time. So we had to tape it. Six months after that, our first record was published. So this is the earliest recording of ltoga Trio. Yes. Yes! Fantastic! - Yes! - Right? - Great, Sunao! - I feel so excited! Makes me want to dance! Right! It's so stimulating! - How about that? - What? How do you feel now? I was afraid to hear this, but now I feel relieved. It's better than our playing now? Of course not! How about selling this recording as a record? "Produced by Koten Dance Troupe." - Tea. - How about it? I never thought we'd be selling records. I don't feel alright about this. We don't know how to do this. You don't have dreams? I'm also against this. Sooner or later you'll wake up. If you have Sunao around, he'll just give you stupid ideas. Whatever. Yuriko. It's a good thing to dream. It's happy to dream. Sometimes you can't dream even if you want to. Oh yes. Yes! We'll build a building! Big production companies have branches all over the world. New York... Beijing. - Beijing? - Paris. Rio de Janeiro. Nairobi. - We'll conquer the world. - I'll make you branch leaders... - 24 hour operations! - No! - Oh yes! Koten Theatre. Good. The wreath is here! Oh yes! This is the opening of Koten Productions. And the weather is fine today! And we're all here... Boss. A speech! - Boss! - Come! Boss! Boss! - No! - Boss! - Boss! - No! Look! Such important stuff! Stop it! They're so excited because of your memories. This music is essential now. Why? Yes, maybe just as you said, it's for me. But for them too. But Koten and the others got so worked up. Asami may quit. Not enough performances... Stop it. ITOGA TRIO 1970 LIVE Soseki. It's finished. You... called me out, I thought it was a date. I'm confident this time. Why don't you come to the office? If this is not accepted, I don't know what to do anymore. Mitsuko told me about the park story. Could you show this to Mr. Mizumoto? Mitsuko... will get engaged soon. I'm going to Mr. Mizumoto's. I see. I'm now in the music business. But it'll take a month to get on track. So things are tough recently. We're looking for capital. You had a date Ms. Nakayama? I can't say I'm a genius. But I may write a good book some time. Perhaps I'm writing some good ones! But people don't get it! They don't know what's good! What happened to the waiting boy? - He's still waiting. - Did she come? No. That's it. I'll take these. This is a gift. Could you tie it up with a nice ribbon? No. I want to train and go far away. Does it snow in your home town? 2 or 3times a year. Right now, it's having cold and dry winds, chilled by the mountains. It's very dusty in the fields, as if horses are running on them. Turning... the sky to yellow. Oh. When I was small, I was running with the wind. I saw nothing but the mountains. Trains with snow on top came from the other side of the mountains. I was dreaming of the life beyond the mountains. Black rail tracks came from the outside world, cutting across my town. I made up my mind to come to Tokyo, because everybody did so after high school. I see. What have you found here? I thought I found it but it ran away. I wish you could catch it. Fried liver and dumplings. Enjoy. Fried rice and plain rice. Here. I only know about Tokyo. What is it? He said he won't see me anymore. So proud! I hate him! I've always followed their wishes. It was yesterday? Let's goto a park. There's one nearby. Yes? Don't go home now. I can't.
