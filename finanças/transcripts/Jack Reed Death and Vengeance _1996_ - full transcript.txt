♪ [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] ♪ ♪ [music] Igor... property is theft. [pleading in Russian to spare his life] [In Russian] Do it. [In Russian] - But he's dead. - Do it!! ♪ [choral music] [shouting in Russian] [gunfire and screaming] Dad? What? You awake? I've been awake since 1974. Where's the bug spray? I think the bugs finished it last night. Maybe we should try and start a fire. Ow. "We" meaning me, I guess. You're the camping expert, dad. Nobody likes a wise guy John. [Jack] Don't look at me like that. We're here for the weekend, if it kills us both. [cell phone ringing] Good morning. Where? I'm on a camping trip with my kid, alright? Dad, if it's important, we can go camping anytime... like in my next life I heard that. No, not you. All right... I said, all right. I'll be there when I get there, okay? [hangs up, clears throat] A multiple homicide. I gotta cover it. Gee, that's too bad. I'll start packing. You could at least pretend to be disappointed, John. Can we stop at McDonald's on the way back? Get out of here... [Charles] Well, well, well, if it ain't Davy Crockett himself. You don't look so good, Jack. You guys can't clear up one little triple homicide without calling me, huh? [Charles] Oh, come on Reed, we saved your life. You know what I mean? One more night out there you'd be dead of exposure. All right, what have we got? [Eddie] Labor violence I guess. Gravediggers on strike. Shooting starts right in the middle of a funeral. Well, good, that means we've got plenty of witnesses. Nope. Nobody knows nothing. Well, they're all recent immigrants, Russian mostly. They're afraid of us, or the shooters, maybe. Or both. [cell phone rings while woman cries in background] Yeah. [Charles] Who? Oh my God, when? All right, I'll be there in 15 minutes. No... keep him in my office. Gotta get back. What's up? Nothing good. Call me later. All right, so the scabs dig a hole... and they get shot for it. Is that the deal? [Eddie] Mmm, no. The graves were dug yesterday. No scabs around today. Well who got shot? [Eddie] Bechenko, the Manager. Now, all that bloods from the first wound. The other wounds are post-mortem. No blood pressure at all. [Jack] What about the other bodies? [Eddie] Same deal. Three shots each. First was the kill shot, both times. Seems pretty deliberate for a picket-line brawl, doesn't it? I'll tell you what. Why don't you go... talk to that priest over there see what he's got to say, huh? [dramatic music plays] [mumbling in Russian] Shut up, fool. What are you praying to, the engine? I'm sorry, Igor. It looks like their funeral has interrupted your funeral. It'll have to be the river. Like to take a swim, Igor? It's a nice swim. It'll do you good. [Sheehan] One of those days, Lieutenant. What did he do? Ran a light. Hit a Mexican family on their way to church. Mom was in the passenger seat; she's dead. The others are banged up, but they're okay. Junior, here, didn't get a scratch but he totaled daddy's Beemer. What did he test? Off the charts. .22. It's all in there. [sighs] I better call his father. I talked to him. He's on his way. I almost felt sorry for the son-of-a-bitch. - Oh, c'mon, Billy. C'mon-- - Don't mind me, Lieutenant. I hate all politicians, regardless of color. Which reminds me Peter Myers called. He's on his way too. What about the TV people? Not yet. But they'll get wind of it pretty quick. He get his rights? He signed the card. [Gordon Jr.] Hi, Mr. Silvera. Did you talk to my dad? It's Lieutenant Silvera around here. Go get a cup of coffee. You really did it this time, Gordon. It was an accident, Mr.-- er, Lieutenant. I swear to God. I mean, I was just coming home from a party. At 8 o'clock in the morning? Yeah. I mean, yes sir. And I was trying to make this light-- Your father know you have the car? Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely. I mean, I don't do that anymore, Lieutenant, I swear-- How much--how much did you drink last night? - A couple beers. - Oh, don't give me that crap. Your sobriety test is through the roof. Actually, it's this cough medicine I've been taking, Lieutenant., because I-- - Where is it? - What? Where's the cough medicine? I don't know. I guess I left in the car. Well should still be there. They're searching the car now. I--I might have finished it. Save it for your lawyer, Gordon. - [father] You all right, son? - [son] I'm okay, Dad. I'm really sorry about this. Charles, do you know Sandy Miller? Are these handcuffs necessary? Well, routine for anyone being held pending felony charges. Felony? It was an accident, wasn't it? [Charles] A fatal accident. He was driving while impaired. He tested at twice the legal limit. Those tests are notoriously unreliable. They're administered by idiots. Well, save it for the Judge, Miller. It's hard evidence and you know it. Do we bother with the trial, Lieutenant or do you just throw him into prison right now? Counselor if you or anyone else, thinks he can walk in here and start pushing me around--! [Gordon Sr.] Gentlemen. Let's calm down. [Gordon Sr.] "Anyone else." I assume that means me. Sit down. Charles, we go way back. I know we don't agree on very much these days but I have helped you over the years. Gordon, don't you come in my office with that. I'm not asking for favors. I'm worried about my son. Now surely you realize that there are people out there who are going to try to use this against me. Out there? Gordon, I came as soon as I heard. Thank you. Are you all right, son? What is this? Is this necessary? [Gordon Sr.] Apparently it is. Well, not for long. I have a mittimus here. Detective Hobart of Central Division is taking over this investigation. Gordon is in our custody as of right now. If we leave right away, we can beat the TV crews. He's not going anywhere. He's gonna be book and printed. He'll be sent over for arraignment this afternoon and he'll probably get bail. Now you can try this mittimus crap with the Judge, Pete. And maybe Bozo here will get the case. Until that happens Gordon will be treated just like every other accused felon whether his father is running for mayor or not. You understand what I'm saying, Gordon? He's right. We have to play this by the numbers, for now. Whatever we do, we've got to get out of here. The press'll be here any minute. Take care of him, Charles. Yeah, he'll be fine. Dad, you mean I gotta stay here? I'm sorry, son. We'll get you out as soon as we can. [Gordon Sr.] I'll talk to you later, okay? I don't understand this attitude, Charles. Her name was Isabella Rodriguez. She was 38 years old. She was a mother of two little kids. Junior, here, is criminally responsible for her death. What don't you understand about that? You scared? Good. You should be. [Thunder erupts] Come on. It' time for Igor's bath. Hey. This is a nice neighborhood. Yeah. It's a Russian priest from the cemetery...it's his church. All hells breaking loose inside. Why? What's going on? I don't know. I'm getting maybe one word out of twelve. But it's got nothing to do with labor trouble. Let's take a look. [tense dialog in Russian] I am brother Yurii. May I help you? Yeah, my name's Jack Reed. I'm with the Sheriff's department. Dirksen, Chicago P. D. What's going on? Her name is Irina Lebed. Her husband was one of the men killed at the cemetery this morning. She says... People are murdered in broad daylight. The police laugh and shake their heads. Nothing is done. Is this what America is about? Professor Suvorov, a great man. [Brother Yurii] His son is gone. Vanished. The police do not care. They smile only; that's it. And people are robbed. They... they are beaten. They... they disappear. And no one cares. [Brother Yurii] And this morning, three are dead shot to pieces by the madman, the Butcher. This is worse than Russia. This is... [speaks in Russian] What? Little Wolves What are you doing here? This is a Holy place. Do you think you can frighten me? Do you think you can frighten God?! No! No. Get out. Go! Get out! [Eddie] Hey! [Irina] Policemen, now you come. For what? A piece of plaster?! What about us?! What about the living?! Who's the Mad Man? [Jack] My name is Jack Reed, ma'am. I'm a policeman too. Uh, you said that, uh, people were killed by the Mad Man by the Butcher. Who are you talking about? Who... who are the Little Wolves? Come on, lady, talk to me. I'll try to help you. No. No. I don't believe you. Wait. Hey, wait a minute, lady. Hey. What's going on, Jack? Ahhh, no. No! Not my new Crown Vic'! [Eddie] Let's roust 'em, Jack. [Jack] You think they'll confess, Eddie? 'Cause there sure as hell ain't gonna be any witnesses. [Eddie] I mean, what the hell's going on here? Where are the cops? Are we in America or what? [TV Reporter] Mr. Thomas, Junior was charged with vehicular homicide and driving while impaired. Sanford Miller, advisor to mayoral candidate Gordon Thomas Senior suggests there might be a political motive behind the arraignment. [Shouting Reporters] Mr. Thomas? Mr. Thomas, any comment? Any comment at all, sir? We demand... this investigation of this tragic accident be taken from the Sheriff's Department and conducted by the office of the District Attorney. That is my statement. Sandy Miller was always a cop-hating creep. What have we got? Open and shut. Rodriguez family pulls up to the stop light. The light changes, they move into the intersection, slowly; it's an old rust-bucket. Bam. Thomas never touched his brakes. He's doing 70 or 80 in a 35 mile zone. He's speeding, he runs a red light, and he's impaired. There it is. What about the cough medicine? I didn't find any bottle. And his blood doesn't indicate any medication. Like you said, open and shut. Well, so what. It is a no-win deal, Lieutenant. Let Central have it. Hey, wait a minute, man-- Now c'mon, man, the kid's gonna walk one way or the other. And Thomas is gonna be around for years, whether he's Mayor or not. You wanna lay down in front of that train? I don't. All right, finish your reports. File 'em the same as you always do. I'll cover for you. Who's gonna cover you, Lieutenant? [District Commander] If you checked in at the precinct before you started nosing around we may have been able to help you. We could've watched your cars anyway. [District Commander] And there's no crime wave in this precinct, Sergeant. No kidnappings. No murder. This is an immigrant neighborhood. Most of the, uh, so-called "families" hustle the immigration people... [Hanlan] Yeah, then "Daddy", or "Little Brother" disappear. Sure. They're driving a cab in San Francisco. What about extortion? What about these teenage gangs? [Hanlan] Yeah, penny ante crap. They all dress up like the KGB. The strong hustle the weak and nobody talks to the cops. Hey, they're Hunkies. I don't like the word, Sergeant. Look, we do our job here, Reed. And we are not the U.N. We're not social workers. But we can't solve all their problems, especially if they won't speak to us. Excuse me just for a second, please. Miss? Yeah, hi. I wonder if I could, uh have a few words with you. Ma'am? Please, just... [District Commander] See what I mean? It's hopeless. Uh, excuse me a minute, fellas. Hanlan, why don't you, uh drop off Sgt. Reed at his office? We, uh... can't have him taking the bus, can we? I appreciate that, Commander. What's it say? Gulov. 135 Kenyon. [Jack] Alright, 135. That should be up here on the right someplace. Hey wait, wait... whoa whoa... hold it, hold it. Back it up. Nah, we can be that lucky, can we? [praying in Russian] He is coming for you, Vassily. Who is coming? Satan. He's coming to punish you for all your praying. You are lying, Sergei. It's true. I swear it. Satan, himself. He's in disguise, though. He looks like two fat man with bad feet. Come here, little brother. [Sergei] Look at this. I love America. Come on. When Satan... comes to the door... you must shoot him. Hmm? Old Latvian proverb. [Vassily] Sergei, who is coming? Is it police? Don't worry, Vassily. I will return. I will save you. Remember, kill Satan. I'll be back. [Jack] Guess it must be the top floor. [Eddie] Why are they always on the top floor? [Jack] Ah, stop complaining. It's good for your girlish figure. But it's terrible for my knee. Maybe we should get some back-up... [Jack] C'mon. We'll just see if anybody's home. Officers under fire at 135 Kenyon Street. It's that pain the ass, Reed, again. I think somebody's home. Maybe we should have called for back-up. [In Russian] Come in, see what happens! What'd he say? I don't know, but he's cranky. Stay back, pal. He's got a gun! It's okay. He's my crazy brother, huh. Hey--hey, don't go in there. Hey! Vassily! It's me! [in Russian] It's me! Remember, be brave. They cannot hurt you. You are juvenile. I will protect you. I will save you. Fool! Do you think you can kill everyone?! Huh?! It's all right. I... I have gun. All right, get down here. Get down. You got the right to remain silent. [Eddie] You got the right to legal counsel. You got the right to unlimited phone calls. You got the right to cable TV. You got the right to pizza three times a week with toppings of your choice. All right, come on. Let's go. Get up here. Hey, Jack. Hey. That the cemetery shooter? That's him. He just took a couple shots at us too. - Yeah, I heard. Good work. - Thanks. I'll go and talk to you for a minute. I don't wanna bust your hump, Lieutenant but you gotta deal with some of these calls. You got a congressman here, two state senators, and a couple of aldermen. Old friends, so they say. Yeah. Yeah, we'll see. C'mon in, Jack. Close the door. Okay. [Charles] Have you heard about Gordon Thomas's kid? Yeah. Vehicular homicide, huh? He's in the big leagues now. Pete Myers been on the phone yet? They were here, the whole crew, including Hobart. [Charles] They want a mittimus, of course. Of course. They move the investigation downtown. Hobart kicks it around accidentally on purpose and the judge throws it out. [Jack] Let it go, Charles. You gotta pick your fights. You can't win this one. Do they really believe that I'd try to screw the kid to hurt his old man? I mean, we were friends once. [Jack] It's got nothing to do with the kid. This is big-time politics. Thomas is gonna be the next mayor. Maybe the vice president in a few years. [Jack] You're up against money, power, and People magazine. Who cares if he got a screwed-up kid? Isabella Rodriguez's family. [Jack] Oh, they'll get to them too. Sandy Miller'll pay 'em a visit. It'll turn out that their family junker had bad breaks. [Jack] It rolled right in front of Thomas's car or something. I-I-I don't like this job today. Why do you think you're here? All these politicians trying to get you on the phone they helped get you this job. You think they were just doing a favor for a brother? It's payback time, pal. You hold on a minute, Jack. That has nothing to do with this-- Hey, hey. Come on, now, don't get sensitive on me. [Jack] It ain't just you. If you are Irish and Thomas was some Mick alderman from the west side trying to get Uncle Seamus out of a jam you'd roll over in a minute. Charles, Affirmative Action is hardly a new concept in Chicago. It's just new for black folks. But there is a price. There's always a price. Kick it to the D. A.'s office. [Jack] Look, don't beat yourself up up about this, Charles. It's your turn in the barrel. It's Chicago. He's a juvenile, Jack. He's what? He's 17 years old. His, uh, step-brother here, Mr. Gulov, brought his papers. He looks 10 years older than that. [Sergei] Poor boy. Hard life. You work at the cemetery too, don't you, Mr. Gulov? Yes, half-time. No, not, uh, half-time. Part-time? Yes, part-time. Mind if I ask, uh, what you are doing this morning when the shooting started? Yes, I was in the north section, uh, passing stone. What? A headstone, big one. I was passing it. [Jack] You were moving it? [Sergei] Ah, yes, uh, moving it. I'm stupid. I can take Vassily home now, yes? [Eddie] You can take Vassily home, no. But, uh, he is, how you say, juvenile, no? [Jack] A juvenile. Yeah... [laughing] If you remember, Mr. Gulov, he tried to kill us this morning. And, uh, he's gonna be charged with murder times three, for the cemetery killings. We got the shotgun. We got the shells. We got his fingerprints. We got the residue all over him. No, he's, uh... he's not going anywhere for a while. If you wanna help him, I suggest you give him a good lawyer. But, uh, thanks for coming in. Ah, what about car? What? My car. I--I need for work. [Jack] Impounded, Mr. Gulov, for evidence. But that car belongs to the cemetery, doesn't it? Yes, of course. I must call them. But they let you drive it, huh? A half-timer? Nyet. No, no, not me. Vassily. Because they are afraid of him. [Jack] Oh. Apparently with reason. We'll, uh... we'll be in touch. Well, I guess I better try to have a conversation with Junior here. Hey, how are ya? Okay? Boy, you like them cigarettes, don't ya? - Yes. - You got key for this? Why did you try to kill me today? I thought you were Satan. Uh, I'm sorry. Say that again. I thought you were Satan. But I'm stupid. A man cannot kill Satan. What about the shootings at the cemetery? [Jack] Those guys are dead, Vassily. Why'd you kill them? Did you think they were Satan too? I did not kill them. More smoke, please? Sure, have some smokes. I can't give you the lighter, that's against regulations. So, Vassily, can you say "hot seat"? "Electric chair"? Hmm? Three murders, Vassily. Special circumstances. Death penalty. Shish kabob. Not juvenile. In Russia, maybe. Here, never. Juvenile, huh? [Jack] We've got three bodies. We've got all kinds of evidence. And we've got you. I mean, even if you plead guilty you're gonna get hammered. I don't understand. You'll do 20 to 25 years minimum. M.. maybe I'm wrong. [Jack] Uh... maybe it was an accident. The... the gun went off. Uh, you sneezed or something. Are we talking manslaughter here, Vassily? How much time for accident? What you say, uh, man-slow...? Manslaughter. [Vassily] Manslaughter. Maybe five years. Okay, it was accident. But not five years. Six months, maybe. Hey, you'll talk to the judge. Maybe he'll see it your way. Okay, so the... the first shooting was an accident. What... what about the other two killings? Were they accidents too? Yes. Yes, accident. You a little grumpy in the morning, Vassily? Coffee nerves? What was Sergei doing? He do nothing. He do nothing. He seen nothing. Okay. Okay. Why? What? These accidents. You're standing there. You're holding a shotgun on these guys. Why? What was going on? Accident. Juvenile. [noises outside] [doorknob turning] [In Russian] Help! Help! Fire! Fire! [In Russian] Help! [In Russian] Oh, my God! Fire! [In Russian] How could they do this?! How could they do this? It's okay. It's okay. Thank you. [baby crying] Sasha! Sasha! Mama! Mommy! [wolf howl] [In Russian] Irina! Hold your baby close, Irina. We will come for you. Soon! [wolf howling] Go to sleep now, son. [video game noises] [Charles] He's getting real good with that computer. [Mary Alice] Yeah, well, I wish he do something with it besides play those stupid games. [Charles] Oh, you know, at least he's learning to use it. He's way ahead of me. You pick up my tux? [Sighs] I'll do it tomorrow. [Charles] Well, now, don't forget. You know, we want to leave here around 6:30 or so. Maybe we should just forget about the banquet. I could use a quiet night at home. What are you talking about? You been looking forward to this for months. What about the new dress you got? I know but I've been tired this week and... What happened? Who called you? Nerissa... and Roxanne. Maybe I'll just call 'em back... No, Charles, don't. They don't understand the situation. I think they understand it very well if they're trying to get to me through my wife. That's not fair. These people have been friends of ours for years... They're friends of Gordon Thomas's too, which is why they called... [Mary Alice] He was your friend too. You named your son after him... And I'm supposed to let his son get away with murder! Is that how it works?! How can you say that to me?! [Mary Alice] These people are our oldest and our closest friends and they cannot understand why you're so determined to personally ruin Gordon and his son! If they, or anyone, thinks that that's what's going here then they don't know me very well and they're no longer my friends. Does that include me to? I don't know. Does it? [Charles] Maybe you're right about tomorrow. We'll spend a quiet evening at home. [dramatic music] [Horn honking] [officer] Put it back by the fence. [driver] All right. [music gets more intense] [car alarm blares] What do ya think? You're beautiful, baby. [Charles] Mmmm... Oh, you smell good too. Hey, look, I'm sorry about last night... No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. [Mary Alice] Forgive me? I don't know. Better do that again. [Charles] Does, um... does this mean, uh... we're gonna go to the dance tonight? Yes, we're gonna go. We're gonna drink champagne. We're gonna dance our booties off. We'll be the happiest people there. Can I ask you something, baby? What? Do we gotta dance? [phone rings] Ah, damn. What? What? [Fireman] We have a pick-up here. [Charles] The fire started in the middle of the lot? Yeah, they used Molotov cocktails. The... the guard said he saw the last one coming over the fence. Why torch it now? I mean, it's already been searched. Maybe they didn't know that. [officer] Sergeant Reed... [Jack] Bicycles. [Charles] Yeah. Look at those footprints. They're small. [Eddie] A woman, maybe? [Charles] Making that throw? [Eddie] Why not? She was wearing combat boots, wasn't she? [Jack] Maybe it was a kid. [Eddie] Wait a minute, Jack. Those kids... [Jack] Yeah. The Bonewagon... [Charles] The Bonewagon? What's the Bonewagon? Hey, come back here with that umbrella. Yeah... that's what they were after, not Thomas's car. Whose is it? I think it's time we had another talk with big brother, Sergei. [Charles] Big brother? What the hell's going on around here? [sound of kicking at door] Told ya. Waste of time. [Hanlan] He's laughing at you, Reed. He's in, uh, y'know, Brighton Beach, driving a limo and he's laughing his ass off. [phone ringing] [game show announcer] Get a good spin, Doug. Eggplant! Beautiful! [phone continues] The phone, idiot! [in Russian] Turn it down. [phone continues] Hello? [Vassily] Sergei. Thank God. I am waiting long time. [Sergei on phone] Vassily, poor boy, are you all right? Sergei, you must come. [prisoners shouting to get off the phone] You must help me, I'm afraid. They put me here in terrible place. You must tell them you are juvenile, Vassily. All will be better. I tell them but they don't listen. [prisoners continue yelling] They put me here with terrible people. - [Sergei] I cannot help you, Vassily. You have sinned, and only God can help you now. You must pray, little brother. - [prisoners keep yelling] - [Sergei] Pray hard. [prisoner] Tell her you love her and let's go! - Sergei! - [prisoner] Move it! Hey! - Sergei! - C'mon, get off! Sergei! [Sergei] Ah, payday. Who's first? Mikhail's Bakery, two hundred dollars. A generous man, Mikhail. Georgi's restaurant, $250. Should be 300 but I'll talk to him. What about Brodsky, the jeweler? Um, Brodsky... he says, sir, his wife is sick. How much? Nothing. It's true. She is sick. His wife has been sick since the storming of the Winter Palace. Now come on, we are wolves, not sheep! You two, come here! Go to Brodsky's. Break the big window. He'll run out with the money. Tell him there's a late charge, mmm, 500. If he squeals, go inside, get his wife's wheelchair, bring it here. What if she's in it? I don't want her, just the chair. Go. He'll pay. Go. You three.. go and see the little bitch with a big mouth, hmm? I want her terrified. Do you understand? I want her wetting her pants! Go. Ahhh... [in Russian] Watching that junk. Fool... [wolves howling] Irina, open the door! We have come to babysit! Irina! Bitch! Hey, bitch, open the door! I'll kill you Bitch! Open the door! Don't hurt me. Please...don't hurt me. [Jack] I hate floaters. [Eddie] Yeah, so do I. But that's a fresh one. [Jack] Well I guess it wasn't a swimming accident. [Eddie] Not with his head caved in like that. Technician said there's a shotgun wound to the back. [Jack] This is the stuff from his pockets, huh? Gimme a... lemme borrow a pen or a pencil or something. [Jack] Well, that's really interesting. What? He's Russian. Look, I gotta find out what we're dealing with here in this precinct. How many people are missing? How many investigations, if any, were carried out? Well, you're gonna need the Precinct Incident Report File the Investigation File, and the Complaint File. Forget about it. Maybe I can shake things up a little bit. Meantime, why don't you see if you can find me Irina Lebed. Who? That little firecracker who gave us Gulov. I wanna talk to her. Now, what do you mean by "shake things up?" You really wanna know, Eddie? Nah, I don't think so. [Charles] Good mornin', Pete. [Myers] No calls, Sergeant. No one opens this door, understood? Gentlemen... what a nice surprise. You want some coffee? Cut the crap. Let's get down to business. I'd like some tea, Lieutenant. Billy, a cup of tea for Mr. Miller here. Thank you. Why haven't you returned my calls? Pete. [Miller] Lieutenant Silvera we're anxious to resolve this unfortunate situation and we'd like to count on your cooperation. Well I haven't read the papers today, Mr. Miller. You win an election in the last 24 hours or so? [Charles] Am I working for you now? Listen... the games are over. You understand? Well last time I looked, you weren't Civil Service either, Pete. [knocking on door] [Charles] You don't need my permission to take over this investigation. Sober up the D.A. long enough to get his signature, it's a done deal. We're not going to move the investigation to the D.A.'s office, Lieutenant. It's too late for that. Too late? The kid won't go to trial for another six months... In six months the campaign bleeds to death. We need this over and done with, now. In two day's time, you will announce that all charges against Gordon Thomas, Jr. are being dropped. What's going on, Miller? I gotta make some calls. The two investigating officers, Carini and Cartwright deliberately manipulated the circumstances of this tragic accident to cause charges to be brought against Gordon Thomas, Jr. They lied. They suborned witnesses to perjury. They fabricated evidence. Have you gone completely crazy, Miller? We have affidavits from a score of witnesses including one of the patrolmen on the scene. [Miller] We have a detailed statement from one Rafael Rodriquez the victim's husband. It must've been expensive. What make you think I'm gonna go along with this? You'll go along, Lieutenant or you'll go down with them. [Miller] We have witnesses and affidavits implicating you too. And make no mistake, Lieutenant we won't hesitate to use them. You have 48 hours to think about it. Gordon know about this? Gordon's a politician. He knows what he wants to know. You surprise me, Sandy. Pete Myers... hell, Pete's got the conscience of a lizard. But Sandy Miller... I've watched you all my life. Birmingham, Selma, Little Rock all those righteous years... Forty years, Lieutenant. [Miller] It was a lot simpler then. It was terrifying and majestic, but pure and simple. Now it's no longer simple and it certainly isn't pure. And we're running out of time. Gordon Thomas may be the last chance we have to put this nightmare of race behind us. And it's unfair, yes. And you are the victims you and your two detective friends. And I'm sorry about that. But there have been many victims over the years, millions of them. And if I'm right about Gordon maybe you and your friends will be the last. [in Russian] This is your father, angel. Remember your sweet father... always. [knocking on door] [knocking on door] [Eddie] Police... I'm, uh, Sergeant Dirksen. Remember me from the church? Yeah. Yeah... Always interesting knocking on doors around here. I'm sorry. Come in. Yeah, come... [Irina] We knew it would be hard but, at least here there could be hope. And for her... and for her there would be more. My husband, he was, uh... intelligent, um...a professor. And he was digging graves. He hated the cemetery, of course. This is no job for him. And now he's dead. And now even hope is gone and... I don't live for myself. I care nothing for myself. Only for her. Only for her. Tell us about Sergei. He is a jackal. When we come here each of us we have something. [Irina] Some money or some... gold, diamonds. Antiques. You understand? Because you cannot start over with nothing. You need something. And Sergei, he finds the new ones. And he watches them. And he talks to them. And one day, they are no more. They are gone. And we go to the police and the police laugh. They say... they say, uh your son is in Miami, your brother is in San Diego. [dramatic music] [Irina] They... they are not dead. They have taken the money and run away. But this is not true. But they will not listen. - No one will listen, until you. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait wait wait--why would there be flies in an empty grave, Eddie? - What? - Because the grave isn't empty. The flies, the Bonewagon the 'half-time' job at the cemetery, the flies... What are you talking about, Jack? Of course they're not in San Diego or Miami, they're here. They're here in Pleasant Creek Cemetery. He buried them in a cemetery probably underneath the legitimate graves. That's why he shotgunned the cemetery workers, because he got caught. [Jack] That's why your husband is dead, Mrs. Lebed. Because that's where the bodies are. [singing in Russian] He needs a doctor, Sergei. Doctors ask questions. He can see, can't he? [Sergei] Baba Yelena, she got magic in her hands. He'll be as good as new in a few days. [phone ringing] It's Vassily. - Hang up. - But, Sergei-- I said hang up! There is no Vassily! Vassily is finished! You understand? You go back. Watch the building. When she returns, I will finish her myself. And you, my frightened little duck you can take care of the baby. [radio announcer #1] They're just pounding the boards today here in Tampa. Parker gets maximum height on the jump shot. He's listed at 6'10" and he's got-- [announcer #2] Yeah, but he's about 6'8", Dom. We know that. [announcer #1] Maybe 6'9". He's been all over the defense today both on offense and defense. He's on the verge of another double-double. [Jack] So this cop goes to a doctor and he says, uh "Doctor, every time I talk to a newspaper reporter, I get a headache. Why is that?" [Russell] And the Doctor says, 'It's probably the hangovers.' You heard it, huh? How you doin', Jack? [Jack] How you doin', Russell? Good to see you. Thanks for coming. [Russell] So tell me, you ever make Lieutenant? Hell, they're still trying to make am a civilian. Hey, I've been reading that stuff that you've been doing on the Garbage Wars. That's really great work. Y'know, I always knew that alderman was bent. The dope put the bribe money in a mutual fund. I'll tell ya, Jack if the politicians in this town ever get smart we're gonna be in some real trouble. Russell, that's probably one thing we don't have to worry about. I got a great story for you. It's got everything in it: struggling immigrants teenage gangs, vicious murders and a local police unit that just ignores the whole mess. I need it right away. Declaring war on the brass again, Jack? Nah... more like a sneak attack. Well, you've never let me down yet. So tell me, Jack, what do you get out of this? Not a promotion, that's for sure. [Nerissa] I'm really glad you both came. I think you're so brave. [Mary Alice] While I'm glad you're glad, Nerissa. But why wouldn't we come? I mean, with Gordon speaking tonight. You know... We've known going for years, haven't we, Charles? Oh, sure. You know, in the old days, we served together, Nerissa. I was his tail gunner. I didn't know Gordon was in the Air Force. He wasn't. If you'll excuse us, I'm gonna dance with my wife. [Miller] Lieutenant, if I may presume I like to dance with the most beautiful woman in the room tonight. Mary Alice, Sandy Miller. Mr. Miller, my wife Mary Alice. Pleasure to meet you. If you will do me the honor, my dear. Lieutenant Silvera. My father was wondering if you have a few minutes. Excuse me, Nerissa, folks. [Roxanne] Close your mouth, Nerissa, before something jumps in there. So, how you doing, Gordon? I am all right, Lieutenant. I'm not scared anymore, either. Will that's too bad 'cause Isabella Rodriguez is still dead. Did you know they work together on a garbage truck? You're kidding. No, it's true. Gordon drove and Charles handled the trash. He was Gordon's tail gunner, he said. So this is something I have to show up for, yes? No... Friday night? The Palm. 8 o'clock. See you then. Charles, I was afraid that you wouldn't show up. Why wouldn't I show up, Gordon? Junior, could you give us a few minutes, please? Oh, let him stay. I mean, this is all about him, isn't it? I don't want him to stay. Junior, could you please give me some club soda? Charles? Champagne. Better make a bottle. Sit down. Thank you. [Miller] Whatever happened between them? Willy Bradford, a poor, black boy, stole a car and the cops shot him and killed him. It was a bad shooting, Charles said. The cop was in a lot of trouble. But it was an election year, and Gordon made some speeches that were... ...Inflammatory. Charles thought they were. A week or so later the cop who shot the boy killed himself. Charles and Gordon were never the same after that. This is a bunch of lies and you know it! You don't think it's possible that the police could do what they did to my son, and me?! What country have you been living in?! Oh, cut the crap, Gordon! Randy Cartwright is a decent, hard-working black man come from nothing! Just like you! And me! He made detective in eight years. Goes to law school nights! He's got two kids! You think he's going to throw it all away because he don't want you to be Mayor?! Well, we have the affidavits and the witnesses. The media, and most of the people, are gonna be on my side! Well, I won't! I'm gonna fight you on this, Gordon-- Yeah, well we're gonna roll all over you, Charles! Then you roll on! I'm gonna go dance with my wife. Is this what it was all about, Gordon? Is this where we wanted to get, so we could be just like them? Getting and having? Taking care of number one? Screwing or being screwed?! What ever made you think that we were better than them? Dad, you're drinking. Yeah, I'm drinking. I've got a bad taste in my mouth. You wipe that smile off your face. You think this is funny?! That man is the best friend I ever had the most honest man I know. And I have to destroy him to save your sorry ass! 'Course it has absolutely nothing to do with saving your sorry ass, right, Dad? Don't you ever talk to me like that again. Don't you understand? This is the American dream, Dad. You.. you work hard. You make sacrifices. You save money, so your kids can go crazy and destroy themselves! Well, congratulations, Dad, you've made it! [fast paced music] [Miller] 10 years. 10 years... working full-time days and going to college and law school at night. I learned just this evening that one of Gordon's day jobs was driving a garbage truck. After years of struggle, graduation admission to the bar, then what? A fat job with a fat paycheck? No. Because by then there had been Selma, and Little Rock four little girls murdered in Alabama the Rev. King dead in Memphis. There was destiny then and duty for Gordon Thomas. You're sure she's alone? I saw them go. Except for him. Okay. You remember what I told you, huh? Lots of noise. Go. Give it to me. No I want her looking at me when I do it. Right into my eyes. [glass breaks car alarm blares] Let's go. [Gordon Sr.] We have come a long way. Just take a look around you tonight to see how far we've come. Some of us. Because too many, black and white have been left behind. That is a problem that America faces now. Not who will sit in the front of the bus and who will sit in the back of the bus but how many will be able to ride in the bus at all. How many, black and white, will be defeated by poverty ignorance, and yes, racism and the greatest, most dangerous enemy of them all... Hopelessness. [horns honking] [in Russian] Stand back. Find her. Hi, Sergei. [Jack] Put the gun down. You fooled me. You fooled Sergei. Eddie! He's on the third floor and he's got a hostage. [woman screams] [gun clicks but it is out of ammunition] He's on the roof. [Sergei] Shhhh... [man speaks in Russian] For you, eh. A gift. Now, tell me. When you sleep do you wear pajamas? Yeah, he's on the roof. No, were trying to get everybody out now. C'mon... [Jack] It's pitch black up there. I can't see a thing. [Eddie] Well, he can't go any place, unless he can fly. Well, then let's SWAT team take care of it. I'm not going to do anything about it-- Right this way, ladies. - C'mon, right this way. - Keep moving. Come on. - How are you doing? - It's OK. I can't even feel it. Did you get him? [Jack] No, we didn't get him, but we will. It's all right, don't worry about it. You take it easy. Just take the rest of the night off. You did a hell of a job, all right? [Gordon Sr.] So what it comes down to... what it always comes down to is good and evil. Now I know it's not politically correct to talk in terms of good and evil. To denounce the slippery slope of moral relativism we find ourselves so perilously clinging to. But I do denounce it. There is a difference between good and evil and we must begin to choose good again. [crowd murmurs] Good... And evil. I am reminded of an old union slogan from the 30s "Which side are you on?" Which side are you on? - [Arlene] Jack? - [Jack] Yeah, um, Arlene I--I'm sorry, uh, we didn't call. This is, uh--this is Irina Lebed. This is Sasha. She's got a bit of a problem tonight... Oh, you poor things. Eddie, take them upstairs to the guest room. There are clean towels up in the closet. Go ahead. Go with Eddie. Y' know, I'll be up in a second with some tea. You can take a nice warm bath, and I'll watch the baby. I'm sorry, Jack. What were you saying? [Arlene] Is she smiling at you? - [baby laughing] - [John Jr.] Look at you. -[Arlene] Don't give her that... - [John Jr.] Cute baby... - [Arlene] She can't eat that. - [Eddie] Why not? - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, well, well, Eddie. You been here all night? [Eddie] No, I've been home. I, uh, came back to talk to you about Sergei. Oh, yeah. What about Sergei? He got away. - [John Jr. talking to baby] - [Jack] Yeah. [Jack] You could've told me that on the phone. What's going on? - Jack? - Huh? What? - Come here. - What? What, what, what? Eddie is here because he's concerned about Irina and the baby, alright? [Jack] Concerned? What--? Sympathetic, okay? Okay. Okay... Diapers are in the garbage and the garbage has been put out. [John Jr.] Speaking of diapers. Mom... Honey, let me walk you through that. - Eccch.. - I, uh, just remembered there is something I want to talk to you about, Jack. - What? - [Eddie] Exhumation. You came over here at seven o'clock in the morning wearing a shirt and tie and wearing cologne, if I'm not mistaken because you wanted to talk about exhuming bodies, right, Eddie? Yeah, that was one of the reasons. It's hard enough to get an exhumation order under normal circumstances. "Your Honor, we really don't want to look at the body. we wanna see if there's anything buried underneath it." Eh, forget about it. No, I think I'm gonna go pay a visit to little brother Vassily. He's been sitting down there in maximum security in the county jail for a couple of days. his back pressed firmly against the wall. Maybe he's looking at things a little differently. Coffee? - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah, please. [Jack] Thank you, my dear. [Eddie] They're, uh, holding the, uh, kids.... the "Wolves"... at the, uh, detention center. I suppose I should go down there and talk to 'em. Let 'em go. What, are you crazy? I wanna try something. Get their names and addresses, and their fingerprints and let 'em go. We got a wounded cop, Jack. It might not be that easy. Nah, you can do it, Eddie. Just wear that cologne. [Jack] So how do you like maximum security, Vassily? Terrible. Terrible people, even guards. Ah, the guards have gotta be tough to work in this place. Hmmm? [Jack] What kind of a deal are they talking about? Seventy-five years. Hmmm. Well, you'll do thirty. That's not generous, but it's not terrible. Y'know, you... you plead guilty to three murders. I murdered no one. Sergei tell me to plea. He tell me to say I am juvenile so I get out soon. What's he say now? He not come. He not come once. He don't even talk to me on the phone. I'm shocked by that. I'm truly shocked. Sergei lied to you. He's not gonna help you but I will. First, you gotta help me. C'mon now, Vassily, you gotta get smart. I am not smart. I am stupid. In old country... they put me in place for stupid people... crazy people. Terrible place. Worse that this one. But Sergei, he come and take me out. He bring me here, to America. He take care of me. He protect me. What... what are you saying, that Sergei is a good man? No. He cheat. He steal. He kill people... not just for money but because he likes to kill them. Then he makes me shoot them or hit them, after they are dead. Misha Sorenski. Yuri Brodski. Nikita Bulgov. I see them always. Yeah, I let Sergei fool me too. But I'll help you, Vassily. I swear to you, I'll help you. No... no one can help Vassily now. Maybe cigarettes. You get me good cigarettes? Unfiltered, yes? Yeah, I'll get you cigarettes. You gotta smoke these first, right? Alright... tell me where the bodies are. [dogs barking] [dramatic music] Baba! Baba! [dogs barking] Old woman! Baba! My guns! Where are my guns?!? So you have returned, finally. Where have you been? The Old Ones have gone. They have take the guns. We must find them. Go. It wasn't me. It was the police. It was you, Sergei. His leg is shattered. He's crippled. I had to get away. I had to shoot. [Sergei] What are you doing? Where are you going? Come back, I have no money. I... I have no guns. I have no shoes! Come back! Yuri Brodsky. Misha Sorenski. -Is that it? - I don't know. Some we do it at night. Some we do in the morning. It... when it's dark. One or two, maybe. Jack! [Eddie] Yeah, okay. Alright. Thanks. They got Sergei holed up, you were right. The Little Wolves turned him in. [dramatic music] Hi, Sergei. [Jack] What, you wanna make a run for it? Hmm? Go ahead. Please... I want you to. Cuff him. Can we get started, please? I don't want to miss my ten o'clock baloney sandwich. How about a drink? Yes. Vodka. A double. A root beer. [Jack] I saw your brother yesterday. Half-brother. You could get him off the hook. As you Americans say, what's in it for me? My sentence reduced from, uh three hundred to two hundred years? He's your brother. [Sergei] Half-brother. Half-wit. I saved him once and brought him here. It was a moment of weakness for me and a total disaster for both of us. No, Vassily needs a structured environment. Besides... I like the idea of you feeling guilty about him for the next twenty or thirty years. What happened to your accent? I still have an accent. It's not the same. Oh, what a detective. [Sergei] I speak better English than you do, Sergeant. Which is not saying much, I know because I probably studied it longer that you did, when I was in the Army. When there was an Army. That's right, nearly Cold War was lost, you know. Everyone was so desperate to study English. Oh, the Great Detective is perplexed, hmm? Who is this person? Obviously he's intelligent and well-educated. Why would he commit such loathsome crimes? Okay. Why? Why not? [Sergei] Oh... the good policeman frowns at the evil outlaw, huh? What do you want me to do, beg for mercy? Tremble beneath the - [men walk in talking] - [Sergei] majesty of your law. - Shut the door. And be quiet. - [Sergei] What hypocrisy. An American lives in a huge house. Thirty people could like in this house comfortably, yet... he's alone. He has, uh, three cars... four bedrooms, six televisions. They sit and gather dust. Another American, a block from here... lives in a cardboard box. Flea-bitten, and starving, he breaks in... to the huge house and steals one of the unused televisions. He is arrested and punished by you, Detective. So, who is criminal? The rich man, the poor thief... or you? This is your society, your law. Congratulations. [Jack] What a bunch of crap. You... you preyed on these people yourself. Poor immigrants, women, children, defenseless people-- Of course, because they are defenseless. Because you do not defend them. I'm not a Marxist, Sergeant. I'm a Darwinist. A predator. A wolf, if you will. I do not accept your society or its rules. So I am outlaw. And I choose to be outlaw. Ahhh. A Darwinist. [Jack] A wolf. Hmmm. Tell me something, Sergei. Does a wolf take pleasure in killing? What? Vassily said that you kill because you like to kill. Does... does a wolf like to kill? Oh... not just wolves. Shall I tell you, what joy really is, Sergeant? [Sergei] It's looking into their eyes, right before the end. They've given up all their pathetic little treasures. And they have only one thing left, and they want to keep it so badly. And they beg you "Please... please..." And then you take it, that last thing. Joy. Exhalation. Life. Oh, I've upset you, Sergeant. Forgive me. Finished so soon? I am disappointed... What are you doing? A new game, Sergeant? What are you doing? This is childish. Hello? Are you watching? Stop this, now. [Jack] They can't see you. Besides, they're cops, Sergei. They don't care about you. Nobody moves unless I tell 'em. [Sergei] No... No, I don't, uh... I don't like this. Hello! - [Jack] Louder, Sergei. - [Sergei] Hello! - [Jack] Louder! - [Sergei] Hello! - [Jack] Can't hear you, Sergei! - [Sergei] You don't understand. I... You must not... [Jack] What? I must not what? [Sergei] You can't do this. You can't do this! [Jack] Why? Why can't I? [Sergei] I... I don't like the dark. - [Jack] What did you say? - I'm afraid of the dark! [Jack] They're out there, aren't they, Sergei? In the dark... - they're waiting for you. - [Sergei] No... - NOOO!!! - [Jack] Say it! - [Sergei] No! - [Jack] Say it, Sergei! [Sergei] HELP ME, SOMEBODY!!! I'm looking' in your eyes, Sergei. I don't feel any joy. No, all I feel is disgust. Outlaw, huh? Shall I tell you what society is, outlaw? See, all it is is a bunch of people trying to live together, trying to -- trying to raise their kids trying to live decent lives and trying to protect themselves from scum like you. Y'see, I get to choose too, Sergei. I choose to protect that society and to kick your arrogant, bloodthirsty ass. I got a big present for you Sergei. Oh, you're gonna love it too. You know what? You're gonna get to spend the rest of your life in the most Darwinist Society on the face of the Earth a maximum security prison in the state of Illinois. Let's see how long you survive. [noise and commotion in station] Jack, can I talk to you? Yeah. What's... what's going on here? Press conference in a few minutes. Gordon Thomas and entourage. Why are they having a press conference here? Well that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Let's find a quiet place. Where's Gordon? He said he'd meet us here. Do we have enough copies of the affidavits? Of the Rodriguez statement? I don't want him saying anything we didn't tell him. And no questions. Sandy, stop worrying. Ah, we'll start on time. I'll say a few words and... Here's Gordon now. [Gordon Sr.] Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen my son and I are announcing that he will plead guilty to the charges made against him. [gasps from crowd] And that we will cooperate fully with the District Attorney's office with regard to sentencing. Gordon will plead guilty because he is guilty. And because he's prepared to accept responsibility for his actions. I will continue my campaign for the office of Mayor. And I will, of course continue in the support and love of my son. I've had a wonderful successful life. But I have not been a good father. I feel I share in my son's guilt. So, Gordon, whatever happens, we'll face it together. [reporters talk in crowd] Now, on to a different matter... I'm sadly announcing the resignation from my campaign... effective immediately, of Sandy Miller. At the request of his doctor, Sandy is leaving public life for good. One of my oldest and dearest friends a veteran of civil rights campaigns over the last 35 years Sandy begins a well-deserved retirement. Sandy? Thanks Gordon. When is the last time any of us heard a politician... a man, speak like this. Honest. Straightforward. Genuine. A revelation... even to me... if one was needed. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the kind of man-- well... let me amend that... this is the man we need in the Mayor's office and perhaps someday... the White House. [reporters shouting] - Well, that was a surprise. - Especially to Sandy Miller. How about you, Charles? [Charles] Jack, I was surprised as hell. Ah, smart politics. Get it out, get it over with. Besides, a lot of voters have screwed-up kids. [Charles] Man, I feel like I can breathe easy. Someday I'll tell you why. - We know why. - No, you don't. Sure we do. [tape recording of Miller's voice] "You'll go along, Lieutenant... or you'll go down with them. We have witnesses and and affidavits implicating you too." - [Charles] You recorded it? - [tape keeps playing] The whole thing. A little trick I learned from one of your predecessors. He was a wee bit paranoid but he had a good reason to be. Billy, Billy, Billy. What would we do with ya, Billy? [Charles] Yeah, Billy. Here's to you. Ahhh. Is this place wired? How 'bout some coffee, Lieutenant? What? Oh, man... the intercom?! [Sheehan] Sure. Picks up the whole room. And I recorded it off the phone on my desk. And you got a copy to Gordon Thomas. And that's why Sandy Miller got his little surprise. No. - [Charles] No? - No? [Sheehan] Up until ten minutes ago I was the only person who know anything about this. Huh, how about that? Why didn't you tell me about this before? Tell him. [Sheehan sighs] I didn't know who was going down, Lieutenant... You, Carini and Cartwright, or just Carini and Cartwright. You didn't trust me, huh? I was hoping you'd do the right thing. And you did. He folded. Not really. I guess he just remembered who he used to be. [Sergei] Hello, Little Brother. Because of your singing, we are both in here now, huh? But I will silence you, Little Canary. I promise you that. Your singing days will soon be over. Get out of the way, man. I'm walking' here. I was talking to my brother. I don't give a damn who he is or who you are. When I'm walking, get out of my way. Of course, my friend. Whatever you say. Who're you calling 'friend,' Hunky? Vassily... Help me! Help me! Guard!!! - Hey, Jack... - [Jack] Hold on a sec', Matt. I got the Sheriff on the phone. You been sending that Russian kid cigarettes? Ah, c'mon, what is it with this kid and cigarettes? I... I gave him two cartons of cigarettes a week ago when he was here for the interrogation. I sent him four cartons yesterday. He can't possibly need any more cigarettes. He don't need nothin' anymore, Jack. ♪ [choral music] They happened within fifteen minutes of each other. Vassily was stabbed 20 or 30 times. In the shower, like the movies. What about Sergei? You'll appreciate this. He drowned. - What? - In a toilet bowl. Somebody held him down and flushed him away. That's appropriate. Any line on the killers? Nah. Vassily was a cash deal... paid for by his brother, I guess. They don't know who did Sergei either but he's a heavy smoker. Why? Well the word is, the price for Sergei... four cartons of cigarettes, unfiltered. ♪ [music] ♪ [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] ♪
