[music playing] JUNIOR GLEE CLUB [SINGING]: We say hello and how do you do? Never goodbye, [inaudible] toodle-loo. [inaudible] They all go through. We're just reg'lar fellers. We know how to read, write, and spell, and history we think is swell. Arithmetic, we don't excel, 'cause we're just reg'lar fellers. Hi Jimmie. Well versed. We don't go in for glamor. And in some things, we're even worse, [inaudible] and grammar. [inaudible] We can't understand, [inaudible] We're just reg'lar fellers. We don't like to hear a do-mi-so-do, we'd rather hear a hidey-ho. Word by word, play by play, at least that's what the grown-ups say. We'd prefer to play all day, 'cause we're just reg'lar fellers. I haven't got a cent, but what do we care? Because we're better off than a millionaire. We've got happiness, enough to share. We're just reg'lar fellers. Socialized, we're not well versed-- Right pretty, ain't it, Dan? Yeah, yeah. Those kids are all right. Say Emory, who do you think is going to win the quiz prize? Well, Jimmie Dugan, of course. I'll tell you what I'll do with you. I'll bet you a buck that Hamilton kid wins it. He's got better marks. Put up or shut up. JUNIOR GLEE CLUB [SINGING ON RADIO]: Socialized, we're not well versed, we don't go in for glamor. And in some things, we're even worse, [inaudible] and grammar. Ooh. Other things we [inaudible] Martha, keep your mind on the game. JUNIOR GLEE CLUB [SINGING ON RADIO]: And anyone can plainly see that we're just reg'lar fellers-- Turn off that radio. JUNIOR GLEE CLUB [SINGING ON RADIO]: Other things-- But this is the big Junior Quiz, Mrs. Carter. I don't care if it is. You know I'll have nothing to do with children. JUNIOR GLEE CLUB [SINGING ON RADIO]: And anyone can plainly see that we're just reg'lar fellers. We're just reg'lar fellers. [applause] Thank you boys and girls. That was swell. Folks, you've just heard the Junior Glee Club, which brings us now to the final portion of the Junior Quiz. And with five contestants still in the running, it's anybody's race. These smart youngsters have given a great account of themselves and it's going to be tough to find a question to stump anyone of them. And now, on with the quiz. And the next contestant is Hazel Barry. Hazel, are you a good cook? I think so, Mr. Hall. My mother taught me. Hazel, there are several portions to your question. You are to define three cooking terms. Think you can do it? I hope so. Well, I'm sure you can. The first is to parboil. When you parboil it means you don't cook it all the way. That's right. It means to boil partly. Now here's the second part. To baste, what does that mean? That's when you wet something in the oven, all the time, with water. [chuckling] You've got the right idea. It means to keep moist at intervals to prevent burning. Now here's the last one. Define consomme. Consomme is, consomme is-- it's soup. That's pretty close, Hazel. What kind of soup? It's soup with nothing in it. That's right. Very good. Thank you, Hazel Barry. [applause] The next young lady is Jane Watson. Jane, here's your question. At a certain spot in the harbor, there's a difference of 40 feet between high and low tide. Supposing a ship drawing 20 feet of water at low tide is anchored there. How much water will it draw at high tide. That's easy. Quiet, please. Let's be fair to the contestant. Think, Jane. How much water will it draw at high tide? I don't know. Oh, that's too bad, Jane. [applause] Well, we'll see if the next contestant can answer the question. Uh, Warren Hamilton. Warren, at a certain spot in the harbor there's a difference-- I remember the question, Mr. Hall, and the answer's very simple. The ship, at either high or low tide, would draw exactly the same amount of water. That is correct. Unless cargo or crew were changed between tides. Or unless it sailed from salt to fresh water. Very good, very good. [applause] And now we come to Bumps Hudson. Bumps, your question has to do with music. Do you know anything about music? Ah, I sing once in a while. Well, that's fine. Our studio pianist is going to play a familiar song. Now, you see if you can identify it. All right, Joe, will you play it for us, please? [piano playing] [WHISPERING]I bet he doesn't know that one. Shh. That's uh, uh, uh, that's uh, uh-- Well, if you can't name it, can you sing it for us, Bumps? OK. [piano playing] [SINGING BADLY]It's the last rose of summer, left a blooming all alone. [laughter] All her lovely companions-- [laughter] Are all faded and gone. No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is sigh. [laughter] It's the last rose-- [laughter] Of summer. Well, uh, now can you name the song, Bumps? No. You-- well, that's too bad. Well, better luck next time. Thanks a lot. [applause] And that brings us to James Dugan. [clapping] MR. HALL: Well, Jimmie, here's a question that's rather interesting. Now, listen very closely. Supposing a large steamer were frozen in the Gulf Stream. What method would you suggest to free it. Now, you could you an ice cutter. Oh, did you say Gulf Stream? Why, it never freezes there. That's right. [applause] [chuckling] MR. HALL: Now, Warren-- [applause] Ladies and gentlemen, in checking over the final score, we find that we are left with just two contests, James Dugan and um, Warren Hamilton. Unfortunately, only one can win. Middleville should be proud of the splendid showing the boys and girls have made in this Junior Quiz hour. Now Jimmie, the United States leads the world in the output of a certain chemical used in aviation. In fact, this chemical is found in its free state only in this country. Can you name the chemical? It's helium and it's used for dirigibles and balloons. [applause] MR. HALL: Very good. Now Warren, it's your turn. You'll find me ready. This question is in three parts. You must answer each part directly. I want you to explain the meaning of three favorite American expressions. You must answer all three. The first is a bunch of fives. Sorry, I've never taken up slang. Jimmie, maybe you can tell us what a bunch of fives means. I sure can, Mr. Hall. A bunch of fives is a fist. [applause] So far, so good. Now for the second one, Jimmie. What does it mean to sock the old apple? That means to hit a baseball a country mile. Jimmie's going to do it. He's going to win. MR. HALL [ON RADIO]: That's fine. Now for the last one, Jimmie. Just a minute, Emory. Not so fast. Just listen to this. MR. HALL [ON RADIO]: What does it mean when a fellow is carrying the mail? JIMMIE [ON RADIO]: That's football, when a feller is running for a touchdown. [applause] Jimmie's done it, by golly he won. I told you he'd win. Yup. [snoring] MR. HALL [ON RADIO]: A real American boy. [cheering] [applause] MR. HALL [ON RADIO]: And now, Jimmie, I take great pleasure in presenting you with these 25 silver dollars. You certainly earned them. You had some stiff competition up here this evening. Now, tell us, Jimmie, what are you going to do with all that money? Well, you see, Mr. Hall, me and some other fellers, and a girl, we got a laboratory where we do lots of experiments and make things. What kind of things, Jimmie? Well, we're all going to invent stuff for the United States. You know, the big defense program. And we're going to make airplanes, and automobiles, and tanks, and all sorts of stuff. And we're going to give them to the government. That's 'cause us fellers, if we want to be reg'lar fellers, have to help the government, just like the grownups. [applause] [cheering] [music playing] Hello, Aggie. Hello, Mrs. Caroline. Gee, I hope I'm not late. No, you're just in time. You shouldn't have rushed so. You're all out of breath. Oh, I had to do some things for the club on account of we're having a party this afternoon because Jimmie-- I guess you're pretty proud of Jimmie, aren't you, Aggie? Oh, I knew he'd win. But um-- What's the matter? Is something wrong? Oh, gosh, Mrs. Caroline. It's Jimmie. He just don't pay no attention to me at all, just like I wasn't there. Oh, is that it? What would you do if you were me, Mrs. Caroline? From one woman to another. Well, I'd, I'd just sort of-- well, I'd, I'd try to be a big help to him, Aggie. You know. And, well, he's bound to notice a sweet, little girl like you sooner or later. All right, I will, Mrs. Caroline. You mind if I take Ruthie over to our laboratory where the party is? All right. Only see that she doesn't get mixed up in that infernal machinery of yours. Oh, I promise I won't. [music playing] Pretty soon she'll be getting too heavy to carry. Oh, I don't mind carrying Ruthie. Honest, I don't. Well, then, I've got to go now, Aggie. [music playing] Don't you worry about the baby. I hope you have a good time too. [music playing] [doorbell ringing] Martha, Martha. The front door. For pity sake, answer the bell. MARTHA: Yes, Mrs. Carter. Coming. How are you, darling? Let me take a look at you, child. I haven't seen you in ages, and how is the baby? That's what I came to see Mrs. Carter about, Martha. It terribly important. Oh, but she told me never to-- Who is it, Martha? Oh, uh, it's your daughter-in-law to see you, Mrs. Carter. Tell her I'm not at home. Never mind, Martha. Why do you force your way into my house? You know very well we've nothing to say to each other. But there is something, Mrs. Carter, something that concerns us both. Very well, then. Get to the point. If it's money you want, you're wasting your time. I expected you to say that. No, it isn't money. Mrs. Carter, I've been told by friends that the authorities are planning to take the baby away from me. Is this your work? What difference does it make whose work it is? If you can't take care of the child properly, you shouldn't have it. I've settled this question some time ago, and you very well know it. When my son married you against my will, he ceased to be my son. I know you hate me, Mrs. Carter. I can understand and forgive that. But Lawrence and the baby, why? Have you said all you've come to say? No. Where is Lawrence? Why haven't I heard from him? You're his wife. How should I know? You are the most cruel person I've ever known. You're a selfish, old tyrant, Mrs. Carter. You brought us nothing but unhappiness, and I hate you for it. No, no, I guess I don't hate you. I feel sorry for you. You must be very lonely. [music playing] [door slams] [music playing] Here comes Jimmie, fellers. [music playing] Oh, and look what he's got. Hi everybody. Oh. Hi Jimmie. Before we start celebrating-- I already put that Project 58 is spinning. Let's all take a look at it. Come on. [music playing] [ripping] Look out, Jimmie, that's one of my mom's bed sheets. Here it is. Look at that. Ooh, it's a pill. Oh, it's super. I make a motion our chief inventor, Puddin'Head, did a good job. Anybody say no? [cheering] Oh, it was nothing. Shucks, I had it all figured out. Now you see-- Say, Jimmie, we better have the ice cream before it melts. Sure, fellers. [music playing] Jimmie, you'll make a wonderful father some day. Better serve the ice cream. All right. [music playing] Pin Head, get me that knife for the cake. And make it sharp. OK. [music playing] Make mine the big one. [smacking] BOY: Ow. [footsteps approaching] Snooping around our laboratory, huh? Trying to steal our inventions, huh? I'll learn you-- What's it all about, Pin Head? I caught him spying on our laboratory, that's all. I wasn't spying either. I was just looking. He's lying, Jimmie. Don't let him get away with it. All right, Pin Head. Relax. Well, just what were you doing then, Bumps? I just wanted to come over and ask you if I could join the Reg'lar Fellers. I-- Bet he heard we was having ice cream. Quiet, Pin Head. What makes you think you could join? Well, lots of things. I can invent things and I can sing too. [laughter] What do you say, Jimmie? Should we give him a chance? OK. Bump, we'll try you out. Sort of a probation. I'll tell you all the rules later. Pin Head, you show him around. Him? You heard what Jimmie said. Say Aggie, what about the ice cream and cake? Now, uh, this is our all-around-the-world sharp medium-long receiving set. [tone ringing] Here. Come on. Good. And uh, this is our all-around rejuvenator. [buzzing] [screaming] What you doing? Sharpening my scalp knife. What does it look like I'm doing? Baking a cake? I was on the radio with Jimmie Dugan. But you didn't win, did ya? No, I'm better at inventing things. Is that so? I've been thinking about things, and inventors got to do a lot of thinking. Yeah? [music playing] Maybe we could use you. [music playing] You got a knife, Bumps? No, I never had one. [music playing] This is a swell knife. You can cut anything with it. I think every feller ought to have a knife. [music playing] That looks like swell ice cream. [music playing] These skates don't look much good, Bumps. No, the wheels always get stuck. Why don't you get rid of them? Yeah, I guess oughta. Gee, I wish I could give you this knife for them. I don't know. You're a nice fellow, Bumps. We ought to do something for you. Ah, I didn't say I wanted to trade. Here's your ice cream, Pin Head. Just put it down. Ain't the knife good enough? I don't know. Oh, all right. I'll toss in the ice cream, but you're getting the best of the trade. If I can have the ice cream, you can have the skates. But give me the knife too. I told you. The wheels always get stuck. See how to do it, Bumps? [music playing] [screaming] [crashing] [all yelling] JIMMIE: Let's get down to business, fellers, and take over our report on defense activities. Start talking, Puddin'Head. You're our chief inventor. I got another idea. Here it is. BOY: Well, what is it, Puddin'Head? PUDDIN'HEAD: It's a tank that goes on land and in water. I don't think it'll work. What do you know about tanks? I seen one in the movies once. It worked, didn't it? Yeah, but not in water. Then how do you know mine won't work in the water? I don't know. I just don't think so, that's all. It's treason, that's what it is. He's trying to sabotage my tank. Jimmie, do something. I make a motion we let Puddin'Head build a tank. What do you say, fellers? Yeah. [clapping] No. Four yeses and one no. You can start building, Puddin'Head. You know, as long as we're going to build this, I think we ought to have a new laboratory. We need a bigger one to invent stuff like tanks. We got money to rent one. Gee, but there ain't a place in town big enough for us. Yes, there is. Hetty Carter's barn, if we could get her to rent it to us. That's an idea. Boy oh boy. [music playing] See? It's just what we need. [music playing] Come on. [music playing] My, my, such distinguished visitors. Hello, Martha. Hello, Martha. May we come in? Yes, but just for a moment, and you'll have to be very quiet. All right, we will. Congratulations, Jimmie, on winning the contest. Gee, that was fine. Gee, thanks, Martha. Oh, Pin Head and I want to talk to Mrs. Carter. What on Earth for? Oh, we thought maybe we could rent the barn for our laboratory. Oh no, no. You couldn't do that. I'm sure Mrs. Carter wouldn't rent it to you boys. Well, why not? Well, you wouldn't understand, dear. You see, Mrs. Carter doesn't want any children about the place at all. Gosh. That's funny. We never did anything to her, Martha. I know you didn't, Jimmie, but Mrs. Carter is hard to understand sometimes. I think somebody must have hurt her once, maybe her own boy. And she's just like that, I guess. Gee. I feel sorry for her. I-- Jimmie, look. What are these boys doing here? Don't be upset, Mrs. Carter. They, they came on business. What business could they have with you? It's with you. We just told Martha. We came here to rent your barn. We've got money-- It's not for rent and never will be. Now go home. You won't change your mind? No. Well, we just wanted to ask. Thanks, Martha. Thanks just the same, Mrs. Carter. Bye Martha. Why did you let them in here? They didn't mean any harm. And I think you'd be a lot happier, Mrs. Carter, if you let somebody into your life. Don't interfere, Martha. I'll bugger you off too. [music playing] Make up your mind yet, Puddin'Head? Not yet, Emory. We got to wait for Jimmie. Hm. I was afraid of that. [bell ringing] JIMMIE: Sorry, everybody. Oh, hiya, Jimmie. Hi. Hiya, Emory. Hi, Jimmie. How'd you make out, Jimmie? When do we take over the barn? Yeah, what about that? We don't. We don't is right. She wouldn't even talk to us. We didn't even get a chance to make an offer. Martha says she don't like kids or something. Why, that old fossil. She ought to be ashamed of herself. [WHISPERING]Hey Jimmie. Here it is. [WHISPERING]All right, Pin Head, relax. Let me handle this. JIMMIE: No, Pin Head. This isn't any good. It's awful old. I guess I didn't get a good look at it before. You couldn't use this for your sea-going tank, could you, Puddin'Head? Oh, boy. Sure I could. That-- And what's wrong with it? I took it off of my own boat down on the river. Well, there ain't many people want a thing like this. Now, um, look at these skates. Skates? Hm. Now, if you was thinking of trading some good, I mean really good skates for an old motor, well-- [chuckling] No. No. Nothing doing. [whistling] Say, hurry up, will you, Bumps? I'm doing the best I can. Well, come on. OK. We're here. You carry all this stuff in, Bumps. Come on, fellers. [music playing] [clattering] [laughter] Do I have to do all the work? You want to join, don't you? Sure I do. Then you gotta work. Now, you have to saw these boards just the way Puddin'Head wants them. He better bring down the motor first. Yeah, after you bring down the motor, and the box, and the nails. And don't grumble about it, see? Aw, I guess I got to start at the bottom of the ladder. What's the matter, Jimmie? Something wrong? Nah, no, nothing's wrong. I just wondered, maybe you were thinking about how you could rent Hetty Carter's barn? I'll figure that out. You shouldn't get mixed up with men's jobs. Then I guess I better not tell you my idea. Idea? Oh, it's nothing. Except maybe if you could do Mrs. Carter a favor, she might rent the barn. But what favor could we do? Well, Mrs. Carter's son Lawrence has been away an awful long time. And I was thinking, if we could do something that would bring him back. Yeah, but what could we do? If we could find him, maybe we could get him to come back. Yeah. That's right. Hey fellers, come here a minute. Aggie just got an idea that maybe Mrs. Carter will let us rent the barn if we could get her son, Larry, to come home. Where'd he go? We'd have to know that, wouldn't we? Do you know, Aggie? I heard Caroline say that he went to New York. Swell. We'll write to New York. Well, what address are we going to use? Pin Head spoils every thing. Say, the police ought to know where he is. Don't call the police. They won't find out you broke Henry Brown's window. Don't worry. Now, let's try to figure this out, fellers. Now, now, how do you write the police? They're policemen. He don't know how to write letters, Jimmie. Dear policemen. Don't you think we ought to write to the police commissioner? We'll try that. Uh huh. Dear Mr. Commissioner-- I got that. I am very anxious to find Mr. Lawrence Carter for reasons that are very secret. Not so fast-- Jimmie, supper's ready. Better come right away. JIMMIE: All right, Molly. I guess we'll have to break it up, fellers. Puddin's always got to go home, just when he's inventing. Oh, come on. Let's go. So long, Jimmie. Well, see you tomorrow. Bye Jimmie. I wish you would find Lawrence Carter and let me know. He went to New York about a year ago. Not so fast, Jimmie. [music playing] [crowd exclaiming excitedly] Boys and girls, take your seats now for the launching. [crowd exclaiming excitedly] [drum roll] Hello everybody. We're just about ready for the big event. The launching of Puddin'Head Duffy's greatest invention. the Colossal Amphibious Tank. [cheering] [applause] The tank will be christened by Miss Aggie Reilly. [applause] And special music by Pin Head Duffy and his band. [band playing upbeat music] What you doing? I'm busy. Go away. Don't bother me. Say, Puddin'Head, if I was you-- Will you let me alone? Well, I still don't think it will work. [laughter] Well, I don't. [band playing] [applause] [crowd murmuring excitedly] [trumpet playing] OK, Pin Head. [drum roll] All right, Aggie. Go ahead. I hereby have the honor to christen you, the Colossal Amphib-- what's the word, Jimmie? [WHISPERING]Amphibious. Amphibious Tank Number One. [cheering] [motor starting] Maybe it will work. [drum roll] [music playing] [crowd murmuring] [drum roll] [music playing] [crowd murmuring] Jimmie, I got to tell you something. Now what's the matter? Ain't we got enough trouble? Jimmie, I got a report that the Reg'lar Fellers is bankrupt. We owe $0.37. [crowd murmuring] Hm. [bell ringing] Well, howdy, fellers. How's the great inventors? Everything going all right? Ah, things are going fair, Emory, just fair. As a matter of fact, we kind of decided not to invent tanks anymore. Oh. Yeah, Emory. Say, you know, this was a pretty good kicker at that. You don't say? Uh huh. And, well, we thought as long as we weren't going to have no more use for it, well, we thought we might do you a favor. A favor? What kind of a favor? Well, uh, oh, you tell him, Jimmie. How'd you like to buy it back from us cheap? No. Nothing doing. You fellas made a deal and you gotta stick to it. [bell ringing] AGGIE: Jimmie, Jimmie, oh, Jimmie. I just heard the most terrible news. What is it, Aggie? What's wrong? Jimmie, I just heard that they're going to take Caroline's baby away from her. We can't let anybody do that, Jimmie. Gosh, that's bad. Didn't you ever get an answer from the New York Police about Larry Carter? No. They would be too busy to bother writing us, but we got to get to him somehow. Lawrence Carter? I knew him all of his life. I remember the trouble that he had with his mom. I lent him the money to get married on. And by golly, he's the only one that ever paid me back. He did? Yup, yup, yup, yup. Sent me $2.00 from New York City. Why, I just ran across the letter today. There it is. Can I see it, Emory? Sure. Gee, fellers, here it is, the address. Criterion Apartment, New York. Emory, could we borrow this for a little while? Please? Oh, I don't see why not, but don't forget to bring it back. We won't. Come on, Aggie. We got work to do. Yeah, we sure do. Yeah, uh-- [bell ringing] Now Emory, about the kicker, how about $5.00? Nope. No. No. Nothing doing. [music playing] We got $2.00. Yeah, we ain't bankrupt now. Boy, that's something. Don't forget to turn that money over to the treasury. Quiet, you. I'm the chief inventioner now. Come on. [laughter] Mr. Lawrence Carter, Criterion Apartments, New York. Dear Lawrence-- Pin Head, why don't you go away? Go on. You bother me. Dear Lawrence-- [tapping] I can talk to you at least. You'll listen anyway. They're downstairs writing a lot of fool letters. What good's that going to do? No good, that's what. Why did your father have to go away far in the first place? [music playing] I've got it. I know what I'll do. I'll fix everything. How'd you like to live at your grandma's house, huh? Nobody else can cheer her up. Maybe you can. I'm going to take you there right now. [music playing] MRS. CARTER: Why didn't you turn it over to the police? You had no right to keep it here. Look, we can look after the child just for tonight. I don't know why. I'm going to see that whoever did it be arrested and punished. [cooing] Everything is going to be all right, Caroline. I'll try to answer your questions now. Has anyone threatened you? No. Why should anybody want to take my child? Ah, take it easy now. We'll find out who it was. Every man in the department is out on search. Suppose something's happen to-- suppose she's ill. I'm so helpless just sitting here waiting and waiting. [baby crying] It's your fault. I suppose I'll be up all night with this crying brat. I'll take care of the child. Go back to your room. I'm awake now. What difference does it make? Don't stand there gaping. Go on, go on. Go on. [cooing] Oh, so that's what it is. I suppose I'll have to take care of you. MRS. CARTER: Martha, what's delaying you? I'll be right up. Martha? Martha? Where's the morning paper? Oh, the morning paper. You want the uh-- What kind of gibberish is that? You know what I mean. Well, um, here it is. So, no wonder you want to keep it from me. It's her child. I'll teach her a lesson. [crying] Call the police at once. Mrs. Carter, don't do anything you'll be sorry for. Will you call the police or shall I? I'll call. [murmuring] Man, I hope they found the baby. Is the baby safe, Dan? Sure, Caroline. Now don't you worry. Gosh, something must have happened. Yow. Gee, I wish I was in that car. Me too. Gosh, I almost forgot. I have to get home and practice my violin. So long, fellers. Maybe Pin Head ain't feeling so well. [music playing] You're an officer of the law. I want you to arrest this woman. But Mrs. Carter, why do we have to do that? She abandoned her child and it's a criminal offense. I'm going to see that she's punished if I have to go to the governor of the state myself about it. You know that's not true, Mrs. Carter. You stole a child just so you could accuse me of deserting her. I don't want to hear any more about this. Are you going to do your duty or not? I'm sorry, Caroline. It'll be just a formality, but you'll have to go to the police station with me. You can't arrest her. Martha, did you let him in this house? No, she didn't, Mrs. Carter. I came in myself because I know what happened to the baby. Well, it was all my idea. I thought if you had someone like that, you wouldn't be so miserable. Mrs. Caroline, she has a hard enough time taking care of the baby, and you've got plenty of money. And the father's-- well, they said you had a baby once, but it isn't here anymore. And, and I thought maybe you'd like to have another in its place. Now you know the whole thing. And you can't have Mrs. Caroline arrested for something she didn't do, because I did it. Get out. Get out, all of you. Get out, get out. Leave me alone. Then do you know what he said? [doorbell ringing] Oh, there's the doorbell, Annie. Yeah. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. All right. Bye. Hello Mr. Flynn. How are you? Good evening, Molly. Is the boss home? Well, gosh, Mr. Flynn, you just missed him. They went to a movie. And left you all alone, eh? No, Jimmie's here. Well, in that case, I'll talk to Jimmie for a minute. All right, Mr Flynn. Just make yourself at home. Oh, Jimmie? Come out here a minute. Mr Flynn's here to see you. JIMMIE: Hello, Mr. Flynn. Hello there, young fella. Well-- [laughter] That's quite an outfit you're wearing, son. Gee, I wasn't expecting company. [laughter] Well, what are you laughing at? Go on. Can't you see Mr. Flynn and I got business together? Business. Something you want me to do for you, Mr. Flynn? No, Jimmie. I just want to ask you a few questions. Is this the letter, or a copy of the letter, you sent to the New York Police commissioner? JIMMIE: Yes. Well, the New York Police sent it to me, told me to check up on the person who wrote it. Now, there's more behind this than you might know, Jimmie. Why did you write about Larry Carter? We didn't mean any harm, Mr. Flynn. We just did it on account of Caroline and everything, that all. Really. [chuckling] I see. Yeah, you boys certainly figure things out. Jimmie, what caused all the excitement is the fact that the New York Police have Larry Carter in prison. [gasping] But, but I didn't know that. Honest, I didn't. Well, I guess nobody in Middleville knew it either. Well, that's all I came to find out. Mr. Flynn? Yes Jimmie? You don't have to tell Caroline about this, do you? No, there's no reason for me to tell her. I wish you wouldn't. All right then, Jimmie. It's a secret between you and me. You're a swell feller, Mr. Flynn. Well, I want to be your friend. Listen, if you ever have any more problems like this, come to me and I'll help you. That's great. And we're going to keep this secret? Mums the word. [chuckling] Good night, Jimmie. Good night, Mr. Flynn. How do you like kingpin in the fourth? Kingpin in the fourth. Listen to this-- You mean that letter to Larry Carter? Yeah. "Dear Larry, maybe you get lonesome sometimes and wish you'd hear something about home. I see your wife almost every day--" The kid was married. "And the baby too. They certainly wish you we're here. You'll be surprised to see what a beautiful baby it is. Your mother's not happy. Maybe you think she is because she has so much money, but I guess she doesn't care so much about that as have you come home. Why don't you come back to Middleville?" What was that part about the money? Yeah. That choppers got an old lady up there loaded with dough and we pushed him around. So what? So what? Well, you're lucky if you're one horse down. So what? Country will be good for you. What about this guy that wrote the letter? Yeah. Hey, Larry never mentioned anything about him. Jimmie Dugan. Oh, he's probably some country dope. I'm not worried about him. What's the set up? Well, it's a cinch. We're just old, old friends of Larry Carter's. Old, old-- [laughter] Old, old friends. [laughter] [music playing] [children exclaiming excitedly] [music playing] [children exclaiming excitedly] PUDDIN'HEAD: What you working on now? BUMPS: One of my latest inventions. A spacial enemy catcher. PUDDIN'HEAD: What's that? I'll show you. Come here. Now, pretend like you're the enemy and walk straight across there. [music playing] Ah, you didn't walk right. Let me show you. [music playing] [snapping] What kind of an invention is that? You got caught in it yourself. Works, don't it? Come here. After you catch the enemy by the ankles, all you have to do is come over and make him prisoner. And I got my secret lock here and I unlock it myself which nobody know how to do it except me. [music playing] But you didn't catch me, did ya? Oh. Do you think we think we can get a patent on these things? Oh, go on. They invented airplanes before us. Gee whiz, I gotta fix this. Wait a second, fellers, I see something. Hold my plane, Skeeter. Martha. Oh, hello, Jimmie. Martha, who's car is that? Larry's friends. Larry's coming home in a few days and they're going to meet him here. Isn't that wonderful? Are you sure they said Larry was coming home? Well, I was right there when they told Mrs. Carter about it. That's funny. What's so funny about it? I think it's fine. Yeah, yeah, that's right, Martha. I'll see you later. Thanks. Fellers, something serious has come up, so I got to let you in on it, but you gotta promise to keep it secret. We will. Sure. I promised to keep it secret myself, but I gotta tell you. You know, Martha said today that the two men at Hetty Carter's house were waiting for Larry to come home. Uh huh. Uh huh. Well, Larry isn't coming home. How do you know that, Jimmie? Because he's in prison. Who told you that? Dan Flynn told me. He got a letter from the New York police commission. And you know what that means, fellers. These two men must know something about Larry. Why did they go to Mrs. Carter's for? Do you suppose they lied to her, Jimmie? Maybe. But anyway, we can't tell anybody about this yet. We've got to handle it ourselves. Uh huh. How are we going to do that? We have to watch those men. Let's tail them day and night. You know you can't stay out after nine o'clock. We'll divide up into detail and two of us will always be on the lookout, anyway until nine o'clock. Unless we can think of an excuse to stay up later. [laughter] [music playing] Your move. [laughter] I'm afraid you've got me cornered. Afraid I have. [laughter] That's another game you win, Ma. Didn't Larry ever tell you I've always been the champion of Middleville? He never got tired of mentioning it, and I believe it now. Larry was the only one who could beat me. Oh? Wait till he comes home. Hm. Then you'll see the fur fly. Yes. Old Larry's a smart fellow. Just the same way in business, always beats the other fellow to the punch. Yeah, he's sure all right, Mrs. Cart-- um, Ma. You made it just like home here for us, Ma, and we love it. Thank you. If there's anything you want, Martha will get it for you. Room service? What more can you ask for? Well, I'd like to-- Uh, good night, Mrs. Carter. Good night. Good night, Ma. Good night. She was laughing and everything. And those two men, they just acted like they owned the place, didn't they, Bumps? Yeah. And one of them looked like my Pop when he gets tired and goes to bed. Mrs. Carter didn't expect nothing. I think we ought to tell her. I think we ought to keep on watching. If something happens and we don't tell her, it will be awful. But if she finds out where Larry is, it'll be just as bad. I don't know what we ought to do. If we could only use that barn, it would be a lot easier. Say, fellers, why don't we take it over? I think Pin Head's got something there. Nobody ever uses the old barn. It can be our secret hideout. And we could do lots of undercover work. Is there any hay up there, Pin Head? I don't know. I'll go up and see. [banging] Hey everybody. -Hi, Jimmie. -Hi. Hi. Fellers, I've just been investigating and I found out it's all right for us to keep on handling the situation ourselves. Oh boy. Shh. [music playing] [WHISPERING]Someone's coming. Duck. [music playing] [WHISPERING]OK everybody. Oh, that was a close one. You're not kidding. Oh. Come on, Bumps. What's this, Bumps? That's another enemy catcher. I don't think it will work. I'll show you. Grab the rope, Puddin'Head. [clattering] -Ooh. -Look at that. Boy, it's-- Gee, it works swell, Bumps. [WHISPERING]Shh. Just a minute. I think I hear a car coming. Look George, I'm getting fed up with this dump? How much longer do we have to hang around? Oh, I think we're about uh-- What's the idea, you little rat? If I catch you here again, I'll brain ya. Now beat it. Oh look, why don't we do what we came here for and get out? This job is giving me the willies. Hey-- Look, George, we've been stalling long enough. We know where the old woman hides the stuff. [playing piano] Let's get out of here before this guy who wrote the letter, this Dugan, shows up. [inaudible] Lubec. I said it won't be long now. [sighing] [playing piano] All right, when? Tonight. Now relax and cool off and let me enjoy myself, will you? [playing piano] [music playing] Hurry up, Lubec. Hurry now. I'm doing the best I can, George. I just can't get used to these old timers. [frogs peeping] [music playing] Lubec, cover that door. [music playing] Oh, I'm looking for Mrs. Carter. [music playing] Martha, we'd like the combination for the safe. But, but I don't know it. Get your hands off me. Maybe we'll help you remember it. How can I tell you something I don't know? Do we have to squeeze it out of you? [screaming] [frogs peeping] [music playing] [WHISPERING]She's acting funny. Something may be up. You stay here and wait for my signal. I'll be on guard. I don't know it. I wouldn't tell you if I did. [door opens] I've been expecting this. Then you know what we want. Come on, open that safe. [music playing] Well, we're going to have to get rough. MARTHA: Don't open it, Mrs. Carter. Calm yourself, Martha. Please ladies, don't waste my time. I'm not going to ask you again. We mean business. MRS. CARTER: I knew that the first day you came here. It's all very clear now how Larry got into trouble. I know where he is. Frankly, Mrs. Carter, we don't care what you know. Open that safe. No. I see you're going to be a little big harder to handle than your son. [music playing] [screaming] MRS. CARTER: All right, gentlemen. I'll open it for you. [music playing] There you are. Hey, you're a lot smarter than your son. Will you shut up? Oh, don't try to hide it. I know Larry's in prison. I haven't the slightest doubt you two put him there. So we did? So what? He just happened to be handy. Look George. More than we expected. Any cash? I guess they didn't figure on starving. Yeah. Want to thank you, Mrs. Carter. [music playing] Lubec. [music playing] Don't let him get away. [music playing] Right behind you. [music playing] The phone's been cut. [music playing] [inaudible] [music playing] Stop that [inaudible]. [music playing] Did you get him? He's in here. He is? [clattering] All right, you get him. [music playing] [snapping] Hurray. Now you listen up. You're dead. Give me that box. [music playing] [screaming] Look how [inaudible], Bumps. You're a swell inventor. Let me out of this. I'll kill ya. [music playing] Let me down out of here. Listen, you kids. They're safe for awhile We better go see if Mrs. Carter and Hetty are all right. Come on. [music playing] Jimmie. We caught something. Boy, we sure had the right hunch getting here quick. I thought you said Bumps' inventions don't work? I give up, Jimmie Dugan. So that's Jimmie Dugan. May I fix the phone for you, Mrs. Carter? Very well. There's an extension right there. I don't know how to thank you, boys. Oh, it wasn't nothing, Mrs. Carter. Oh, we could do it again any time. Now it should work, Mrs. Carter. Answer the phone. Good work, young man. Give me the police. This is Mrs. Carter speaking. Dan Flynn? I want you to send some men over to my house right away. That's it. I'll explain later. Oh yes, and I want someone to pick up Caroline Carter and my grandchild. What? Oh no, not that. They're going to live with me from now on. It's sure a fine thing you've done for the kids, Mrs. Carter. That's nothing to what they did for me. [band playing] I think I ought to tell Caroline the news we got from New York about Larry coming home in a few days. He's been cleared. Don't you bother telling her. I'll do that myself, and a great deal more too. If it hadn't been for my stupidity, Larry would never have left Middleville. [band playing] Quiet, fellers. Mrs. Carter, the fellers and I'd like to thank you for the new workshop, and the tools, and everything. Three cheers for Mrs. Hetty Carter. [cheering] [applause] Thank you, boys. Come on, kids. Oh boy. [inaudible] You'll have to get used to this. I'm going to take up a lot of this youngsters time from now on and make it a little easier for you, Caroline. Thank you. [SINGING]Let's sing hurrah for fun, each and every one. Come on and let's make gladness ring. Start each day with a hurray, knowing together share ra, ra, ra, ra. Let's enjoy every girl and boy because the booms are on the rise. In the near and let's give a cheer. Don't let anything interfere. Loud and clear, let the whole world hear, hoorah for fun.
