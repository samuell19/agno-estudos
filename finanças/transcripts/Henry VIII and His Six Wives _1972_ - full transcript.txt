[applause] We, therefore, thank you for those subsidies you have voted towards the war. A war in your defense. [applause] And for the trust you have shown us in committing the colleges and chantries - to our care. My beloved subjects... [scoffs] ...it may be the last time we have occasion to parole this parliament and address the state of our realm. Now it is not unknown to you that we have reigned o'er this kingdom for nearly 40 years. During which time we have so ordered, thanks be to God, that no outward enemy hath oppressed you - or taken anything from you. But... unless you, my Lords temporal, and you, my Lords spiritual, and you my loving subjects, study to amend one thing that is amiss... there can be no peace within the realm. Charity and concord... are not among you. St. Paul says, "Charity is not proud. Charity is not envious, charity is gentle and... so forth." But what charity is there in you... when one calls another... hypocrite and a Baptist, papist, heretic? Be in charity, one with another... like brother and brother... love... dread and serve God. So that which I, as your supreme head and sovereign lord exhorts and require you. [snores] - [indistinct chatter] - Is he really going to die? I suppose he is. Why don't you... [indistinct whispering] [Henry VIII gasping] Your Grace... must prepare to meet his God. What judge send you to pass this sentence? [man] Your physician, Sir. They can do no more. It is time for Your Grace... to weigh his past life... and to seek for God's mercy... through Christ. [horse galloping] [crowd cheering] For the prince, Madame. Oh! For our son. - [applause] -[trumpets playing] - [drum rolls] -[band playing] [crowd applauds, cheers] [women laugh] [woman shrieks] Thomas, I believe you educated your wife. Would you do the same for my son? Gladly, Sir. Would you? Katherine did you hear that? More's gonna educate the prince. [Thomas] An honor, Your Grace. But, it will be to His Honor, Sir. And what would Your Grace, have him learn? [Henry VIII] Oh, everything, Bishop. The old and the new, Aquinas, Euripides, your Erasmus. Sir, at this moment, the ladies are waiting - to celebrate his birth. Another time, Thomas. [crowd cheering] The only text that Brandon never read would be a stud book. [scoffs] Charity, My Lord. [whimsical music playing] - Largess for the commons. - [drum rolls] -God! Come, you shall pick them from me. - [crowd cheering] -[women laugh] [Henry VIII laughs] [people cheer, laugh] [woman giggles] Henry... [speaking Spanish] We must go to Richmond. [crowd cheering] [sobs] - He was not ill. - There's no remedy, nothing the physicians could do. It was so sudden. Kate, this is the will of God. - Will of God. - And we must accept it. - Will of God. And ask His blessing. [sobs] We'll-- We'll make pilgrimage to Walsingham D, Hales. Uh, we're still young, we'll have other children. God has chosen to take the boy. [sobs] [both cry] I'll give you another son, - I promise you. [speaking Spanish] [both speaking Spanish] [man] Sir, your father's policy was ever to avoid war aside from the financial consideration of sending forty thousand men into France. And you talk just like my father. Now the archbishop will tell me that God only forbids war - because of our sins. - [Fisher] Your Grace-- My quarrel is God's quarrel, is it not? Sir, all the world knows Your Grace is yielding the Pope's cause. That you would rather die than take any dishonor. - But the point in question is-- - The point, my tutor, is... whether we allow the King of France a pronounced heretic to bend all Christian princes to his will and pleasure, My Lords, we are in Holy League with the Emperor and his Spanish Majesty to defend Christendom. Are we to betray our sworn alliance? - The Queen's been at him. - Howard, your whispers are as private as a horse's fart. [laughs] The Queen's parentage has nothing to do with it. Naturally, her father is anxious to regain his territory in an effort to increase his while we sit hoarding our miserable store of gold like some old lick penny. Did the Fifth King Henry decline such a challenge? He knew France was his birthright, and by God, he claimed it. I'm not against giving the French a good hiding. But what surety is there that our men won't come limping home with the flux again? Because this time the almoner will see, - they have proper victuals. Can you do that Master Wolsey? Can you procure good cut-rate beef for us? [all laugh] My Lords, we have not yet considered the other danger, -Scotland. - [man] Fisher is right, Sir. With so many men out of the kingdom, they might do us great mischief. With all respect, Your Highness, I propose that we wait upon events... if there should be a change of fortune. If the Emperor should prevail-- [Master Wolsey] By your leave, Sir. Would it not be a sorry thing for His Grace being so expert in archery to see the Emperor with more strings to his bow? Sir, I beg you not to be lead into any foolishness. Gentlemen, I've-- I've ever accepted your good council but in this instance, I do overrule you. The dignity and the unity of the Roman Church must be defended. Therefore, the Queen and his regent will hold something of our power at home whilst I lead the army to France. Master Wolsey will supply us with food, men, transport, and all our engines of war. The King will have new dockyards in the estuary of the Thames, at Deptford, and at Woolwich. At Deptford a guild of pilots will be formed for the purpose of sound and navigation. His Grace further commands construction of the following ships for which levy's will be raised. The galley of the Virgin Mary nine hundred tons, 207 culverin, The Lion, 950 tons, a hundred and eighty falcon and culverin. The Great Galley, 800 tons, a hundred and twenty falcon and demi-culverin. Send her out. - Henry, why are you-- - Don't speak, Madame. Read that. Is this your father's hand? - Yes. But-- - Read it. It was brought here by the French Ambassador. Proof that your father is a liar. A conspiring liar. And that he's made peace with France. - He must have reasons. - Oh, yes. He's to receive the territory of the Navarre. He's been bribed, Madame, bought. Three months after promising to continue the war, which he induced me to enter as you induced me to it. Because I had been at some pains, Madame, some expense. And now when... when we are ready to renew the campaign when the kingdom of France is at my feet. Your father gulls me... and his servant, the Emperor. Do you see this clause? Here's the clause, Madame. Speak it. "And if the King of England refuses to accept such a peace..." [Henry VIII] Yes, yes. "...we, the emperor and I... do solemnly pledge ourselves to assist the King of France in the defense of his realms." My friends, my sweet allies. [sighs] I-- I do not think... that there is any... faith in this world, you all play me false. -Do I? - Yes? - At Flodden? - You did not beat the Scots, Madame. Flodden was won by the Howard's, Madame, by English Howards. And you would do well to attribute your victories to God, My Lady, before yourself. You think to rule me but you will do well to assume a woman's role and give me a child an heir to this throne. Do you think I do not pray for that each day of my life? One still-born female hidden away like a pauper's breath. Two boys that cannot live out - a month. - Henry, do you have any love - for me? - Princess do not marry for love, My Lady, but to beget children. Then give me a healthy child! [sobs] Sir, I am yours, your servant. I did not spent. I cannot think of my father without shame. This is well, Madame. [cries] For I intend making peace with France. A greater peace than your father can imagine. I've been made the royal fool but I've learned the lesson. They shall never deceive me again. I will never trust anymore. Draw up an enactment for the preservation - of forests, Wolsey. - And the seeding of new ones? Good. We have a moat about us but it must be fortified, ships and ordnance, My Lord Cardinal. Crews trained to fight with cannon until we have built such a fleet that as may not be destroyed. Sir, if I may venture to say so, there are two further elements that constitute the defense of this kingdom. The love of your people which Your Grace already has-- And the son which I lack. Is that it? We must secure the succession, Sir. Without an heir there could be a return to civil war. May I speak my mind? Yes. Are we so certain of the legality of Your Grace's marriage... with his brother's wife? There was papal dispensation. But could there not be objection to it? Did not Your Grace in point of fact make formal objection during your father's lifetime? As you know, Sir, I have the very greatest respect and admiration for the Queen. But, even in Rome they are saying that Her Grace might be expected to step aside if there were no heirs. And that the Pope could not oppose a matter of such necessity. I would remind, Your Grace, that our precedents for now, for the King of France, King Henry-- No. No, I-- No. Not yet. I-- I couldn't ask it... of her yet. Of course, the Queen may still bear a healthy child, but should she not, Your Grace might well consider marriage with a Princess of France... for the comfort of Your Grace's realm. [bells dinging] - [indistinct chatter] - Your Majesty. Now, by the grace of God, the sons will follow. Sons? Sons? [pants] Only a daughter, Mary. Lady Mary. Poor Mary. [men laugh] Uh, Thomas... when I was a boy, you were one of my heroes. A great name amongst scholars. It was always, "More says this, More thinks that." The years have not changed my feeling for you. [dogs barking in distance] [sighs] Will you sit on my council now... and advise me? I need your advice. Then Your Grace shall have it, so long as I can keep a good conscience. - What mean you? - That I may be allowed to serve God first. - Why, we all must. - [women laughing in distance] [Henry VIII] Your family late to bed? They forget time when they chatter. - What age is he, your boy? - Nine, Sir. Well favored. Strong, isn't he? Thomas, is my-- Is my marriage unclean? - A curse to God? - No, Your Grace. A verse in Leviticus plagues my conscience. "No union with a brother's wife may bear true issue." Your Grace's brother died young. But she was his before me. He held her first. But without true knowledge of her... and that is the biblical meaning. Then why have I no son? Why? Why? All the world has a son. Am I not a man like you? - Be patient, Sir. - Oh... [scoffs] ...how long? How many pilgrimages to the abbey to touch the holy relic and seek God's blessing? How long can a man be patient? All his life, if he must. [speaking Latin] [choir singing Latin] [Henry VIII] And, my known sweetheart... nby turning over in my thoughts, the contents of your last letters. I have put myself into a great agony. nI beseech you now to let me know your whole intention as to the love between us two. I must obtain this answer of you. [laughs] Your Grace knows it already. [Henry VIII] Your brothers at court and Norris and Tom Wyatt, the center of your world. How long can you bury yourself here in Hever? Until I make a good match. Don't mock me, Ann. I've had no peace, no moment's rest for thinking of you. I received the clergy, council, embassies, but half aware of what they say when your image is before me. I've mistook of the clock. I've never known such joy before. - Longed such despair. It's as though I never lived to love nor my blood never sank until I met you. Don't mock me, Ann. [moans] - No. - Ann. I know soft words or French cleverness. I must seem rude to you, but it's an honest rudeness. [speaking French] - Yes. - That you will serve me only? - Yes. - Forsaking all others? - Yes. - So what am I, then? Another mistress like Bessie Blount or my own sister? - You're not of them, no. Call mercy and you'd conceive another bastard. Hmm. Is that your leaning, Sir? Or would you have an honest son to succeed you? Wait, Ann. - Only wait. Oh, then farewell to my young looks. I'm sailing to Rome. When? When Wolsey returns. Sir, if you were free... I would give myself to you. My heart and my body. [birds chirping] [dogs barking in distance] You have much fortune, My Lady? [clanking] [coughs] Bet you would shuffle faster, I believe, without your glove. My Grace shows courage. It's beyond his strength to keep his eyes. What would you do, My Lord? Appeal for the case to be heard in England. But know this, Cromwell, it is one thing to arrange a collusive divorce for the dynastic reasons, and quite another to displace the Queen for this foolish girl. Not such a fool perhaps, My Lord. And His Grace would've been tired of her. Of what he's never tasted? You pray God that he does and that we're free of her before the storm breaks.Make no doubt, Master Cromwell, there will be a storm. You win again. [groans] [laughter] Mistress Boleyn has the good fortune, never to stop for the King. [Henry VIII laughs] But I think My Lady will have all... or nothing. [labored breathing] [man] Katherine, Queen of England, come into court. [Katherine of Aragon] Alas, Sir, how have I offended you? On what occasion of displeasure have you that you intend to put me from you? These 20 years I have been your true and lawful wife and by me, you have had diverse children... although it had pleased God to call them out of this world, that has been no default in me. And when you had me at the first, I take God to be my judge. I was a true maid without touch of man. And whether this be true or no, I put it to your conscience. Therefore, I most humbly require you to spare me the extremity of this court. Until I may know what way my friends in Spain will advise me to take. And if you will not extend to me such indifferent favor... your pleasure then be fulfilled. And to God do I commit my case. [applause] [indistinct chatter] [man] Katherine, Queen of England, come again into court. Katherine, Queen of England, come again into court. Boleyn the whore! [man] Laud's away with the Pope's nose! [woman] Undress, dearie, lend me a part! [man] ...for the poacher! [indistinct chatter] [Thomas Cromwell] You mark it well and the street walls, My Lord. The filth pictured on them. Give me time, Master Secretary. Mistress Boleyn is with child, there is no time. Five years the King has waited on the Pope's decision. - He's losing patience. - Do you think Rome must give ground now? We've mustered such a body of opinion - from the universities-- - There is only one opinion His Holiness can afford to entertain, the Emperor's. Because the Emperor has him in his power. And the Emperor will not see his aunt divorced. - That is unalterable. - But we must have His Holiness' sanction. Without it, a future heir could be held illegitimate.Would you have the King crawl to Rome on his knees? Our people would never suffer that. Precisely. You want the papal blessing upon this divorce. It will not be granted. Therefore, we must divorce the Pope. - His Grace will not like it. - And he's halfway to it. Head of the Church of England. We've only to complete the separation. My Lord Archbishop, it is our business, yours and mine, to clear the ground before His Grace. Remove the stones, that stench... the filth that might offend the royal eye. That's why my late master failed. And I shall not fail because I anticipate the King's wishes. Now, does he want his new queen full-bellied at her coronation? I have already prepared the annulment of His Grace's union with the Lady Katherine... and drawn up all necessary papers proclaiming her Princess Dowager. Within the day of sentence, the King's new marriage to the Lady Ann can be confirmed... and her coronation may then take place. I did not think to have underestimated you. [scoffs] My dear Cranmer, what you needed was not time but reassurance. [laughs] [firecrackers crackling] [laughs] Let the Pope excommunicate me! - I don't give two straws! - He only threatens, Your Grace. He would forbid me mass, deny me burial, cast me to hell if I am, and should I now kiss his ring? [scoffs] I shall give His Holiness such a buffet as he's never had before! His name shall be obliterated from all books of worship. He should be known henceforth by the correct title -the Bishop of Rome. - Your Grace, are we not in danger of a divided kingdom? A two-headed monster? Is your allegiance divided, Norfolk? - No, Your Grace. - No more is my kingdom's. Obedience to the Pope, the Bishop of Rome... is unmanly, unholy, and it's un-English. From this time, the church shall pay its taxes not to the Vatican, but to me. And a tenth of its revenues. But if there's disaffection in the monasteries, we will search it out. You have appointed commissioners? Yes, Your Grace, and also to inquire into the general conditions of these churchmen. - Mm-hmm. - Sir? - Hmm? - Regarding the Princess Mary-- - Yes, I hear she's ill. A slight indisposition, Sir. [man] More than that, I believe. Sir, her mother's been asking to nurse her. Would Your Grace consider rescinding their separation? Not until they admit to the illegality of the Princess Dowager's marriage to me. Now they would only conspire to gather and incite rebellion or cause us to be invaded. They must submit! They must agree to the succession of the Princess Elizabeth. Until such time... until... [sighs] [groans] [sighs] Until such time as the Queen bears us another child, a son. And they will swear to my supremacy of the church like any other subject and any... any man, woman, or child who refuses. [breathes heavily] I don't care who he is. Fisher, More, the Confucian monks shall be put under the tinder. These people shall learn the truth of the old prophecy. That I should begin my reign as a man... and become more raging than the lion. Norfolk. [Norfolk] Your Grace? If you can... save Thomas More... for me.

A fine air, Master Smeaton. Will Your Grace favor us with one of one his own? [Henry VIII] No. Not now, Norris. You look tired. Shall I read to you? I bought some passages in the new books. Thomas More... my one true counselor. The most honest man in the kingdom. The most captious. You are the cause of his death, Madam. His own willful disobedience, Sir. It has made a fearful noise throughout Europe. If you listened to every slander, we shall soon be pease pudding. You must be more audacious yet. While the dowager and her child are at large, - they can do you great harm. - Hmm. Mistress Mary should be wed to some private gentleman. - My daughter? - Your bastard, Sir. Or let her be placed as maidservant to the princess. We'll think on it. And now, you shall forget all these cares. [chuckles] [sighs] [sighs] I've planned a feast for us. A great revel. Masks? Mummeries? And very curious disguises. The Ethiope Queen and her train. You should be the Ethiope Queen... with your dark looks... and your sweet, slender... - [Ann laughs] -[Henry VIII moans] [moans] Why did you take my letters... that you sent me at Hever? I had them tied together and locked most securely. I do not have them, sweetheart. [scoffs] They'll come to light, no doubt. [moans] [people cheering] [cheerful music playing] To mark the Queen's intimacy with her music man. Groom of the chambers who I heard it privily. [laughter] [cheerful music playing] The night crow. - So? - My niece, the great night crow. Do you admire the masque, Signor Chapuys? Most elegant, Sir. Especially Her Grace's steps. All her own devising. [cheerful music playing] My God, it's meant to be Wolsey. [applause] Your Queen salutes you, oh, Solomon. [breathing heavily] You are dark, Madam. [Ann Boleyn] Scorched by the hot suns. You know my meaning. Wanton, extravagant, Madam, to treat a cardinal in such a fashion. I am queen of a wild land, Sir. And I may do as I please in it. Take care, Madam. It was but a mask, Sir like any other. I think not. It lacked respect. You've often blacked your face and wielded - a sword in dumb show. - Enough. [indistinct chatter] I admired your ballet, Madame. I understand from the king that Your Highness is to be blessed with another child in the new year. [Ann Boleyn laughing] Have I said anything to amuse Your Grace? Forgive me. [laughing] [birds chirping] So... she's dead? Your Grace... When? In the afternoon. God rest her. Then God be praised that we are now delivered from all fear of war. Katherine, Queen of England. Stubborn to the last. Never yielding one. I would speak with you, Sir. Alone, if you please. - Signor Chapuys. - Your Grace. Oh, that stupid little man with the documents again. - He came to tell me -- - [Ann] Am I Queen here, Sir, or am I not? [sighs] Yes, indeed you are. Then I demand that you send Mistress Seymour - from this court. - [Henry VIII] Demand, Madam? In all the years I lived with Katherine there was no demanding. You assume privileges that are not yours. And you make presents to that pallid bitch, hmm? - Nonsense. - A locket, a sapphire locket with your image in it? [clears throat] And what is this, then... that I found about Mistress Seymour's neck? - By God, you... No, no. No. You are governed by your condition. You should rest now. You should take care of our child. The physicians say... it will be a son, Madam, a fine son. They all say it. The astrologers... the cunning women. So be at peace, sweetheart... and all shall go well with you. - How can I be-- No more. Please... rest. - Rest! - While you go to that Seymour thing. No, Madam, but to hear mass for the late Queen... and then to exercise. [door closes] [Suffolk] Culpepper, His Grace's horse. - [dogs barking] -[Thomas] Wine for His Grace. Thank you, Thomas. - Now, Suffolk! - Yeah! [upbeat music playing] [Suffolk grunts] [Suffolk laughs] [both grunt] - [Henry VIII screams] [dramatic music playing] [Henry VIII] Are you honest, boy? [labored breathing] [Jane] It was your fall, Sir. It was your fall, Sir. It was then the Queen took to her bed. We were afraid you would not live, Sir. It was the child that died, My Lady. And it is now only to assure... that God will give me no sons by her. [groans] Your Grace, let me leave Greenwich. - No. No! - If I were gone, Sir, - you and the Queen-- - No, no. I will have no more issue by her. Oh, Jane... I have been as a man spellbound these ten years. I was seduced into this marriage by witchcraft. Everything my people have ever said of it has proved right. Christ's name, she even has the marks upon her.She tries to hide them. And the devil's stigma. Sir, I can say nothing of this. But you will have seen them surely. I only know that she bears you a great love, Sir. And at my presence, she may have caused such a miscarry. Therefore, Your Grace must let me go now before I harm her further. Or my soul before God. I beg you, Sir. Very well. Go back to Wiltshire. But a woman wedded in the power of devils is no lawful wife. [dogs barking in distance] - [man] Now! - [screams] -[indistinct chatter] How was this obtained? Smeaton confessed to me personally, Sir, he admits to three separate violations. And the others? - Those he implicate? - Brereton on 16th November, Norris on the 19th, Lord Rochford on the-- Her own brother? Dear God! I fear to continue lest I anger Your Grace. Do you believe this, Cromwell? Sir... I am forced to when I consider the close detail. And the expenses outlaid by Master Smeaton. Where could he have got such monies, if not, from the Queen? But Your Grace was to attend the May Day Lists. I believe you should still attend them, Sir. [indistinct chatter] [audience cheering] [Ann laughs] Do you suppose Henry Norris is teaching us how to jig? [Ann laughs] It is so hot, so unbelievably hot. Do you not think so, Sir? [indistinct chatter] [audience cheering] Oh, bravo, bravo, Norris. [Ann] Oh, poor Weston, He'll break his own neck rather than his spear. [laughs] [dramatic music playing] [Ann laughing] [eerie music playing] You will arrest Norris, Weston, Brereton, and my Lord Rochford, immediately. But take the Queen later. [indistinct chatter] I said noon. Is it past that? No, Your Grace. Beauty is a wind-blown bladder. She's guilty, Cranmer. Guilty of treason. Two grand juries and twenty-seven peers find her so, Your Grace. Why? Why did she withstand me so long and then, oppose me? Her own brother, even. Was it to get a son? She laughed at me, Cranmer. She's boasting with them, holding me impotent. Sir, I am sorry that such faults were proven against the Queen. I never had a better opinion of woman-- [grunts] I think Your Grace would not have gone so far, if she had not been culpable. She was in conspiracy to be rid of me. Then she has deserved her sentence. I... I-- I shall ride out after-- I-- I cannot remain here. I shall ride into Wiltshire. May I remind Your Grace of the Rogation Days that lie ahead? What? If Your Grace intends to follow the advice of his counsel for the welfare of the nation... then your betrothal should be declared at once. Oh, yes. See to it. Is it-- I-- - I rely on your discretion. - Only, Sir, that, uh... no marriage could take place on Rogation. [gunshot fired] [gunshot fired] [bell dings] There's the church now, Sir, - through the trees. - Oh, yes. - If Your Grace would rather-- - No, no, no. We'll be there before the sky breaks. Are they bound for the village? [Jane] No, Sir, but to Hailes. - To the abbey. - [Henry VIII] Oh. - You've been there? - Many times, Sir. And seen the blood of Christ? - Yes, Sir. - Hmm. I have a phial of our Lord's tears. It saved me from the plague once, you know. Oh. They're crowding to Hailes now. Since it was visited by the Commission. The King's men are only anxious to report abuses, Master Seymour. And to lay their hands upon some ornament for the King's Exchequer. Your brother should guard his tongue, Sir.It's safe enough with me but not before His Grace or his men. Within a sennight, His Grace will have wed and bed our sister, milad. Then you'll scrape to me, eh. [birds chirping] [bell dinging] [Cranmer] Safe conduct for these men. Safe conduct for these rebels. Hold the groove. We bear no quarrel with Your Grace... only with heretics, and subverters of the law. One God, one king, one faith, Sir. Return to the old order. We want no bloodshed. And yet, you've taken my commissioners' lives.One beaten with staves, another torn, limb from limb. [Sir Ralph] Sir, they were guilty of misappropriation. Your Grace knows the north country is not fat, we can bare afford tax, Sir, let alone the extortion of these agents. [groans] What kind of men are you employing, Cromwell? They know their duty, Sir. Deception, breach of trust, is it? No, Your Grace. But you see now a great discomfort - you have caused my people? - Your Grace knows-- I know that you'd give me the lie. That your no-meat Vicar General but a dissembler, a great crippler, uncouth carter, you-- [grunts] We will consider your terms, gentlemen. Both with regard to the abbeys, our counsel of the Lady Mary. Meanwhile, we grant you our letters and papers of pardon for this rebellion. Thanks be to God. Now, note, Sir Ralph... the benevolence of your prince. Note how bloodshed may be avoided. And learn by this small warning to keep you true men-- - Oh, we are no traitors. - Oh, we never thought it. You shall both be well housed and entertained. - See to it. - We humbly thank, Your Grace. That I must treat and dissemble with these creatures. Don't we know, after 28 years how to govern our kingdom? Oh, get up. Off your knees. - Norfolk, this is your doing. - [Norfolk] Your Grace... If you had fortified the River... - I require of you. - Your Grace, - there are 30,000 of them. - I have never yet readthat a prince's counsel should be appointed by rude and ignorant common people. Have you, my lords? We have not one third their numbers. There are much disloyalty among our men. Christ, gentlemen, must I do everything? Work for you, think for you, keep you in wealth and sate. And now, must I teach you how to quell insurrection? You will maintain this truce until such time as you have greater levy, and then, destroy these lewd subjects who have dared raised arms against their sovereign. Reduce its land to its due sovereignty. Your Grace has already promised them pardon. Promised? Bishop, that is all. - [Gardiner] But, Sir, - Will you gainsay me? No, Your Grace. Will any man? Speak up. Spit it out. For I intend such execution of these offenders. I shall prove example to the rest. Their heads and quarters shall be set in every town. They shall be hanged in their several villages from the trees of their own gardens. - Oh. - Madam, it is no new thing to see men hang. I have the direct guidance of three million people. A savage people. And fear begets obedience. - [choral music playing] - [indistinct chatter] [soldier] Come on, move out. That's right. [soldier] Now move out. [soldier] Come on, now. [chickens clucking] [goats bleating] [fire crackling] Keep from the King, stay back! - Keep from His Grace. [birds chirping] Sir, I'm ready to believe some few instances - of corruption. - [Henry VIII] Halt! Priests who sell the Church's plate, jewels, and timber for their own profit. Monks found in bed with their drabs. Nuns who support their bastards out of Church monies. The list is endless, Madam, and beyond redemption. Your monks, Madam, whose business is the cure of souls, do more traffic in images and relics. A lord's coat here. A lady's smock there. Saint's clothing to cure our barren women. [yells] To grow corn, to stop weeds. And you believe such things? Very well, then, Madam, I will curb your idolatry. Do you recognize this phial, which Cromwell brought from Hailes for my instruction. Look, look, look close, now. Look at it! You see nothing, do you? You've not yet paid for absolution. But give me your coin, Madam, and presto, now, you see the blood of Christ. Now, you are absolved. Except that it is the blood of a domestic duck, which the monks renew once a week. And will you still make a God of the Pope's creatures, Madam? [sobs] It is not what it seems, is it? [Jane sobs] Forgive me. I'm a rough man, rough-tempered. I wouldn't have shown it to you. Jane... Jane, don't make me doubt. Ever. I'm-- I am-- I'm frightened and-- When I doubt, I strike out in blindness. I-- I don't know what to say or do. Am I sick? Perhaps, in my mind. Am I? No, Sir. I feel so old. So old. You must rest, Sir. [both sob] Oh, Jane. Jane. If only you and I had met before, for I doubt now we shall have any children. Oh, I can't sleep. This leg will not let me sleep. - Let me call the physician, Sir. - No. He can do nothing. - Shall I stop their music? - No. It pleases me. Signor Chapuys sends them to woo me on Lady Mary's behalf. Hmm. Could Your Grace not find it in his heart to forgive her, and bring her and little Elizabeth back from Hunsdon? - Bring Mary to court? - Yes. She's an unnatural brat. But you need her, Sir, as she does you. [chuckles] Jane, Jane, Jane. You are a fool... but kind. The kindest soul I ever met. [groans] The Lady Mary is the most obstinate girl that ever was. [crows squawking] [indistinct chatter] [Norfolk] Good day, Bishop. At least the Queen has had her way in this. Ah, yes, the meek shall inherit the earth. That's not original, huh? [thudding] [man] The Lady Mary. Interesting to see who can pretend the best. She is his daughter, milord. Sire... your holy humble, and obedient servant... asks your blessing. My dear child, rise. You are most welcome. Welcome to court... Mary. Mary. Some of you wanted me to put this jewel to death. [Jane] That would have been a great pity, Sir. To have lost your chief jewel of England. Oh, sweetheart. Edward, if it's a boy, Edward. She'll be open-laced with stomach by Corpus Christi? [indistinct chatter] [panting] It's been 30 hours. The midwife says there is a choice, Sir. Her Grace is begging us to save the child. Oh, God. Let it be a son. [groans] [screams] [Norfolk] Thank God, you've come. We've urged His Grace to accept God's pleasure in taking the Queen to comfort himself - and the prince-- - Is the boy healthy? He'll have to be nursed. [Cromwell] Then the king must take a new wife.[man] God's blood, man. - You tell him that. - He's in there? [man] His Grace will see no one. [knocks on door] [door closes] [fire crackling] Your Grace? Good day to Your Grace. Have you seen my son? Yes, Sir. He'll live, won't he? Oh. He must live, or there's no... reason to it all. Everything shall be done for his governance, Sir. In the meantime... I would urge Your Grace to think of providing for a new wife. Leave me, Cromwell. But, Your Grace, Sir... It's time to be private. We must consider the boy's condition, Sir. Leave me. I shall never... marry again. But you rub salt into my wound. Now, go. Go! Before I do you some hurt. Jane? [pants] You will guard my son, now? Be loyal to him? Yes, Sir. My Lord Hertford? Your Grace? [Henry VIII] As the boy's uncle... you should be Lord Protector. The succession goes to the prince... and to the Lady Mary and then Elizabeth. As God say, it will. My son, guard him. [baby crying] [Henry VIII] Is his food tasted? - Yes, Sir. - Everything he eats? There, there. Come to your father. [humming] He bites his lip. His Grace is cutting another tooth. [baby wailing] There, there, there, there, there. Oh. Here, you take him. Take him. He's a merry boy. [chuckles] [Ambassador] The fairest child that I ever saw, - Your Majesty. Yes. Now, Ambassador, about Madam De Longviers-- Sir, the lady is already promised to Scotland. If Your Majesty would consider her sister, - or the Princess Madeleine-- - Monsieur, I am big in person. And I have need of a big wife. I know. You shall bring them all to Calais for me.I fear that it would not be possible, Sir, to trot them out like horses. But if Your Majesty wishes to send someone - to look at them-- - No, no. I must see for myself. See them sing. Perhaps, you would like to try them one after the other. And keep the one you find the most agreeable. [clears throat] Thank you, Monsieur. We shall think on it. If I may suggest to Your Grace-- Yes, yes, Cromwell, the Protestant League. You never stop suggesting anything. It would restore the balance, Sir. A treaty with Cleves will drive a wedge between France and the Empire. Oh, well, let me see that picture again. Everyone praises her virtue. Her beauty. Mm-hmm, but is it a likeness? - Hmm? - Master Holbein is generally faithful, Sir. Is she musical? Does she sing and play the lute? I believe not, Sir, but her needlework is unsurpassed. Shall we weave with her, then? [chuckles] What a blow to the Empire and to France. To ask them both for brides and to take neither. [laughing] I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll have this, um... Ann of Cleves. Send someone to negotiate the marriage. [chuckles] [Henry VIII] Where is she? Where is this paragon? [Cranmer] We did not expect Your Grace at Rochester. The Princess Ann and her ladies are already declared, Sir. Get Cranmer. Such praise, once ahead, we cannot abide our impatience. We would nourish love with a suitable gift of welcome. [speaks German] Madam... Welcome to England, madam. I trust Your Highness has not suffered - from her journey? - Yeah. Yeah. [speaking German] Good. [Ann of Cleves speaking German] Baroness Bremdt. Frau Osenbrooke. Baroness Locke. Frau Willig. Frau Swatzenbrooke. I will bring the interpreter, Sir. No, no, no. Another time, milord. Your Highness. Your Grace. Whom should a man trust in this world, when there is no thing real in it? - Is this her likeness? - Yes, Sir. I think. Where are the great pits in her face? Hmm? She has a queenly manner, I think. I like her not, do you understand? She is nothing fair, and I like her not. Cranmer... you must find means to avoid this marriage.There can be no impediment now, Sir. Not unless you wish to drive her brother into the hands of the Emperor. I have not been well served, Cromwell. I have not been well served. [laughter] [man] He said they wanted three thousand of those. - [laughter] -[indistinct chatter] I promise you one thing... I promise you one thing, these strange maidens that moo about are gonna be shipped back to Cleves - in the morning. - Yes, Your Grace. Oh, if it were not to satisfy my realm and my people, I would not do... that I must do tonight. For no earthly thing. [women laughing] Good God, madam. [Cranmer speaking Latin] Amen. [speaking German] [Henry VIII] I can't touch her, Howard. All I say to her is good night and good morning. Poor men can choose their wives, but I have this great Flanders Mare. I like her even worse now, if someone-- Cromwell, no doubt. Has told her to make herself more agreeable. Howard, she smiles at me all the time. Cromwell has much to gain, Your Grace. I understand he received a pretty sum from the Duke of Cleves when the marriage was celebrated. Well, it shall not be consummated. I'll find some way to have it annulled. They're packing her off to Richmond for her health. The one thing that's pleasant in her company is that little maid in waiting, your niece. We are all in sympathy with Your Grace. You shall think no more on it today, Sir. But enjoy the fine dinner that My Lord Gardiner has prepared. Yes. I like Lamberth. I like Gardiner's table. - [men laughing] -[music playing] [indistinct chatter] Your little niece... is she a good girl? Irreproachable, Sir. One of the most pure and honest condition. Not like another of your clan? Ann Boleyn? Oh, no, Your Grace. She is a good Catholic. Make her a grant of land. [laughter] [indistinct chatter] [Norfolk] A young wilding to whip the stale blood, and lead him back to Rome. But how to do it, eh, My Lord? [Gardiner] I believe it's the matter we'll put to the clergy, a complication, that His Grace wedded against his will. And that it would prevent a threatened invasion. No, she'd never agree to a divorce. Who knows? If the terms were made sufficiently attractive, she might even become the king's adopted sister...told me, are you Plantagenet, my dear, but a descendant of Charlemagne. The College of Arms looked it up for me. There's Cromwell to consider. Just the wall carter he's abused his betters long enough. She'll help rid him for us. Good day, then, Mistress Howard. - Your Grace. - For the present. - [Norfolk] Your Grace. - [Henry VIII chuckles] Oh. [grunts] No, no, no. Fine dinner, Gardiner. [Gardiner] Thank you, Your Grace. [Henry VIII] Hmm, delightful. You are greatly honored, niece. I had not looked for it, Sir. - I had wished-- - Mistress... you may no longer consider your own wishes. You now have a duty to return England to the true faith. Your Lordship gave me very great comfort in your house Such nobles, My Lords, so much gold plate. And so many retainers in His Lordship's household. A small army? - [Henry VIII] Ah, Cromwell. - [Cromwell] Your Grace. - [man] Your Grace. My Lord. - My Lord. [man] My Lord. We are pleased to see this concord.[chuckles] Let's, um... what's this I hear of your land enquiry? - Sir? - To the German princes, as to whether they have any castles for sale? [laughs] Your Grace knows how these rumors fly. - No more than that? - No, Your Grace. Well, we should be sorry to think you were deserting us, Cromwell especially for such Lutheran ground. - Indeed, Sir. - Oh, Howard? Did you look at those geldings for me? Short-winded, Your Grace. I send them back with their tails docked. [laughter] My Lord, Your Grace knows I would never exceed the limits imposed by his articles. I'm really delighted that you're not going to Germany. That you'd remain here to do such good service. - Sir, if I could. - Your Grace. Good day to you, Master Wriothesley. My Lord. If it lies within power to make your majesty still more prosperous. But how would I ever reward you, Cran? You have it all. The Privy Seal, the Garter, the Vicar General, the Earldom of Essex, and now Lord Chamberlain. What more could I do for you, hmm? Your Grace, might box my head at times. [laughs] That would not be seemly. But I'm keeping your Lordship from his visitors. - Your Grace. - Mm-hmm. [man] Now, My Lord, concerning the validity of His Majesty's present union and the Queen's pre-contract with the Marquess of Lorraine. [man] I thought that had been disclaimed. [Cromwell] You are in a great hurry, gentlemen, - to begin without me. - Naturally, Her Highness will need to stay in this country as security for Cleves' behavior. [Norfolk] Cranmer, do not sit there. It's no place for you. Traitors do not sit with gentlemen. [guard] My Lord of Essex, I arrest you in the king's name. I'm no traitor. Upon your conscience... am I a traitor? Let me speak to the King. No, Cromwell, by your own law, that no man accused of treason may attend his Grace. Send to his house to make inventory. Take him. [Edward Seymour] Wait. [eerie music playing] [Cromwell grunts] [Norfolk] Now, take him away. - Traitor! - [man] Traitor! Traitor! [all] Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitors! [groans] But he... he died in the faith. [chuckles] [Catherine Howard giggles] Catherine? - [Catherine Howard giggles] - [Henry VIII] Catherine? [giggles] [Henry VIII] First, velvet sarsenets. But you wanted me to have them. But not in such quantity. My darling, the treasure is not in exhaustible. If it were... we would have given you a public wedding at St. Paul's. Forgive me. [chuckles] You know, I can refuse you nothing. [giggles] You woke last night in your sleep. You cried out. I was dreaming bad stuff. What? Hmm? Hmm? There was a bird caught in the room... - In your dream? - ...flying against the walls... the bed curtain... and hitting the window. I went to free it. Hmm? But it was the Devil in the shape of a bird. When I caught it... it cried out in Devil's voice... so I broke its neck. Blind... blind, blind... I went blind because-- - It was but a dream, Sir. - Yes, yes. You remember your cousin? Ann Boleyn? Sometimes. - Your Grace? - Do you have him? Have I Your Grace's permission? Oh, bring him in, Lady Rochford. - Huh? - Pick him up. - No. - Oh. - Not another one. - Oh, it's delightful. - But you've had three already. - He's for the Lady Ann. - Of Cleves? - Yes. Oh. The settlements I've had to make on that woman. The manors, the estates, and now a spaniel? Oh, so like to have the little dog. May I give it to her? Please. Oh, it's a dear little thing. She can have it. [laughs] You Grace is so kind. - Oh, thank you, Sir. - Oh, Thank you. - That's okay. [giggles] [Henry VIII] I should have listened to Cranmer. He said Cromwell was the best servant of Prince Emma and he was right. Cromwell knew how to prod parliament. An unlike pretext, he made me put the man to death. [Gardiner] We were concerned only for Your Majesty's safety. Yes. And you don't profit, no doubt. I know the good service of the flatterers. - Now, leave me. Is it open? - Yes, Sir. Doctor Budds says it must discharge freely... - [indistinct] -What would you be without rank? Leave him to young Culpeper. - Does it offend you to do this? - No, Sir. I don't wish the Queen to see it. There's no one else I trust. Are you honest, boy? Your Grace? Well, you've never shown me anything but loyalty... and affection. You might have been my son, Thomas. Your Grace, does me much honor. Well, not too tight. [groans] Oh, it's strange. I was feeling so improved. But says the physician it was caused by that fall I took. - Do you remember? - Yes, Sir. And not God's judgment. Oh, well, I can't joust anymore, but when this is healed... I'll rise at 5:00, hear a mass at 7:00, and ride till dinnertime. And not eat so much. Your Grace will tire us all yet, Sire. There's not a man in the kingdom who works longer or harder than Your Grace, and they know it and love you for it. You wait till our progress next month. I'll be hunting up northern game aplenty. [groans] - Is it done? - Yes, Sir. Off with you then. [Catherine Howard laughs] [laughter] [both laugh] - [dogs barking] -[men shouting] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [horse snorts] [laughter] [Henry VIII] Come, now. We should ride out together. [applause] [thunder rumbling] [rain pelting] [indistinct chatter] [dogs barking] [thunder rumbles] [Henry VIII] Come on. Come on. Down you get. Oh. [laughter] Oh, oh, oh. ♪ Oh, I think of them ♪ That I think of most ♪ ♪ And I think of them ♪ In their peep-into-holes ♪ ♪ Creep is up ♪ And creep is down ♪ ♪ And peep into holes ♪ - Come here, you rat-catcher. - You can go now. - Your Grace. [groans] Who's that man? The new secretary, Sir. I've not seen him before. He was in attendant on my grandmother. [thunder rumbles] His name? Uh, Dereham, Sir. Mm-hmm. [thunder rumbles] [grunts] We can't have you taking ill. You look something pale of late. - Pinching your cheeks. - No, Sire. I'm in good health. Hmm? Are you with a child? No, Sir. [sighs] I had a special jewel made for you, madam. - A jewel, Sir? - Mm-hmm. I had hope to have given it to you by now. Do you have it here? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, will you show it to me? [chuckles] Well, it was to have been a reward but I see, it must be a pledge instead. [grunts] - This. - Beautiful, it is. - Mm-hmm, mm. You should know I read bad, Sire. A rose without a thorn. Take it. Here. Wear it now. My very little girl. [laughs] [man] We are pleased to learn Your Grace's subjects in the North showed such gratifying repentance. Oh, and such gratifying coins, My Lords. Our return is also blessed with the princesses' return to health. We have asked our holy father of Lincoln to draw up a thanksgiving for this. And for our good life with the Queen. - But, Sire, it's only... - And know this, my Lord Archbishop... we will not have her Grace subject her to malicious gossip. We will not have secret papers trusts into our hands. Nor will we believe such calumnies coming as they do from the Protestant members of this council.Your Grace will have to know... that since our first discovery, certain examinations have been conducted. The groupings, you mean. The Rack. No, Sir. Simple inquiries into Her Grace's childhood. Voluntary confessions made by the waiting women in her grandmother's house. And you believe servants gossip? Sir, that evidence is well substantiated... and can be confirmed by my Lord Admiral and the Duke of Suffolk. Hmm, you have been busy, haven't you? Your Grace requested me to verify the facts. For our protection. To prevent slander. My Lord, I eat clerks. I don't listen to them. [breathes heavily] Your Grace, we have indeed talked with the gentlewomen who were in service to the Duchess of Norfolk. Several of them were privy to the Queen's guilt... and can testify to the... impure life led by Her Grace before her marriage to you. I give it no credence. The lesser misconduct took place... with one Mannox, a musician... when Her Grace was 13 years of age. Made more culpable was a Master Dereham. Dereham... with a scar on his face. And both these men were subsequently examined by your Grace's secretary. Dereham admit, Sir, that he was accustomed to visit Her Grace's chamber at night... and that they exchange many gifts and love tokens. [scoffs] You told me she was pure. That there was no impediment to her marriage. [Edward Seymour] But the man, Dereham denies any familiarity with the Queen since her marriage, Sir. And this was some years ago? Yes, Your Grace. She's always shown perfect love to me. Your Grace, we must consider the circumstance of Master Dereham being lately taken into the Queen's service. Thus proving her intention to wrong Your Grace, and therefore presumptive treason. The musician confesses, Sir, to having felt the secrets and other parts of the Queen's body. To having seen a private mark on her body. The other openly declares that he has known her Grace carnally many times, and in the presence of these servants. [cries] [women laughing] [eerie music playing] [horses trotting] Henry? Madam, your guilt is clear and your life forfeit by the law. But the king extends his gracious message to you. He believes your sin's committed in ignorance. If you do now acknowledge and make confession of them, you will not suffer from it. Thank the King for his mercy. For his goodness. Sorry if I have wronged him. He's been most kind to me. Madam... Did you not lie with Master Dereham? You are on holy oath, madam. I was constrained to it... Yes? ...without my will or consent. And you call him husband? You were, in fact, promised to him? - Never. No, Sir. - Madam, think now. I beg of you. I am trying to help Your Grace. If you acknowledge pre-contract... you are bigamists but you may still be divorced. It was no pre-contract. - [sighs] -I'm a Howard, Sir. Master Dereham, a poor creature. I was foolish with him, yes. But he has not touched me nor looked upon me, except in honor... since I married with the king. And for good reason, which he admits. What reason? That he was supplanted by another. That he was succeeded in Your Grace's attentions by one Thomas Culpeper. Oh, Sir. With your goodness, help me. I beg you. Help me. I would have wed him. My little, sweet fool. And been his wife. But they worked on me, Sir. My Lord of Norfolk, Bishop Gardiner, my grandmother. Talking, whispering together. Talking till I was dazzled, till I was bound to the king. Now, my family's gone and I'm not a young girl. - I wouldn't... - Madam, you must calm yourself. - Don't judge me. - Your Grace. You all handle me. [screaming indistinctly] [crying] Your Lordship is a good man. She was the devil... my cousin. They broke her neck for it. She died well they say. Nobody-- Oh, no. [crying] Culpeper. Thomas. [sobs] Thomas Culpeper. No. No! [crying] [drums pounding] [man speaking Latin] [eagle squawks] [birds chirping] [man] Senior Chapuys. Good day, Your Excellency. [Chapuys] I must see His Majesty. Not now, Sire. He will not hear a business. He diverts himself in the field these four months. Nevertheless, he will have to know that France has broken the peace and attacks the emperor in his lands. If I make war on France, senior, I shall lose... their annual tribute. Is the emperor prepared to recompense me? But, Sir, you-- you have already concluded with his Imperial Highness to campaign against the common enemy. How do I know he'll keep his word? I've been cheated too often, Senor. I'm quite independent. [burps] If people want me, they may come forward... with offers. But, Your Majesty, - may I remind you that... - [Catherine Parr] Edward!Edward! [operatic music playing] [Catherine Parr] Are you all right? [indistinct chatter] [Catherine Parr] It's all right. [indistinct chatter] [Henry VIII] Mistress Parr, you like children. I think. I am not unused to them, Sir. Mm. Since your husband's death... I have seen you many times at court, Madam. Your house is known for its entertainment. My husband left me well provided, Sir. You, uh... You favor... [groans] ...the new faith, do you not, Madam? I favor toleration, Sir, and freedom of conscience. Mm. Many Protestants visit with you, I think, among them Sir Thomas Seymour who has been paying you advances. Are you promised to him? No, Sir. Because I, uh... I know you for a lady of good fame... serious, and well-learned. Madam, you... have that reputation. In short, I wish to wed with you. Your Majesty... Well? Your majesty would find me ill-chosen for a wife. - Why? - Account of my beliefs. You think them so different? [chuckles] By your pardon, Sir. Yes? When a boy of 15 can be tied to a stake at Smithfield and burned for his faith. Speaking against the Sacrament, that is a sin, Madam, and the toleration of it, a worse sin. Then I must be a great sinner, Sir, and no fit wife for Your Grace. Besides, I have no children... nor hope of issue. And you said yourself, my children should have a home. And... And I... desire company, Madam. I would not be alone. Not alone. ♪ You pay me with a kiss ♪ [laughter] And now you shall try. Oh, that is a wrong key. Oh, no. False note, my boy. Here. Pluck this. Pluck this. ♪ In this meadow ♪ You bade me with a... ♪ [Wriothesley] You see, brother? He has found peace at last. What kind, Sir? A sort of peace. A strange sort of love. [Henry VIII singing, laughing] [dramatic music playing] [whimpers] [indistinct chatter] Send for Cranmer quickly. [Henry VIII groans] Your Grace... - must prepare to meet his God. - [Henry VIII groans] [wheezes] What judge sends you to pass this sentence? Your physician, Sir... they can do no more. Will Your Grace make confession now? [breathing heavily] To Cranmer? [Henry VIII laughs] [Henry VIII coughs] For my body... let it be laid at Windsor. Yes, Your Grace. With her... with Jane... Jane... [groans] [Cranmer] Your Grace. Do you die in the faith of Christ? [Henry VIII pants] Do you die in Christ's faith, Sire? [Henry VIII grunts] [pants] [gasps, groans] [woman crying] [man] Of your charity, pray for the soul of the most high and mighty prince, our late Sovereign Lord, King Henry VIII. [melancholic music playing] [man] Of your charity, pray for the soul of the most high and mighty prince, our late Sovereign Lord, King Henry VIII.
