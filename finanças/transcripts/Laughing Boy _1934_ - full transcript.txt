There's a horse with a.. Let's take a picture.. Stupid thing. Hold up here, we want to take your picture. 'Really, I do. Let us stand right there.' I do not like that, I think. (male #2) 'Hold on here, look up.' [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - Alaho. - I not see you before, I think. - Where you come from? - Far away. I thought so. Your face is new. What is your name? My milk name is Sings Before Spears but Laughing Boy, that's what they call me. I'm called Red Man. Everybody knows me. I am the wrestler. [cat meowing] You are a Paiute, I think. How do you know that, grandfather? [sniffs] My nose tells me. Wait. Maybe you would like to buy some whiskey, I think. I've heard of this whiskey. It's not good, they say. Yes, it's bad, they say. - You never try it? - No. What does it do? It makes your heart very happy. It makes your head crazy. I don't think I like a crazy head, I think. It makes your heart very warm. Does it make you sing and pray? Yes, sing very much pray very much. Sometime I will try it, but not now. Now I'm hungry. - 'Ahalani, my uncle.' - Ahalani, Laughing Boy. Ahalani, my beautiful aunt. - Ahalani, my nephew. - Ahalani, my nephew. This is Jesting Squaw's Son, my friend. [indistinct chatter] - Your father did not come? - No! Fifty sings he has seen. You think that's enough? But my mother wanted me to come. Yeah, she was right. It is time you came to your first sing-dance. I like it. It is happy here. [sniffs] That goat smells good my beautiful round aunts. They're wonderful and it's so atmospheric. - You give me cigarette? - Huh? Oh, sure. Oh, wow, we saw an Indian smoke party. (male #2) 'Go right ahead, boy.' Oh, Fred, look. It is a girl, isn't it? I think. Look-look there, gorgeous thing on the bark. - What? - That silver belt on that man. - Oh, gee, I gotta have that.. - Oh, now. I just want the belt. Now, you just bargain. Good men, big smoke, dollar a-piece cigar. - My present. - Have a cigar. Honestly, they are. - No, no, no. - Oh, no. [chuckles] - No, you have to take this off. - See, that comes off. - And the band comes off. - There you are. Yeah. Uh, uh, that's how you smoke it. - Oh, oh.. - You got fire? Oh, yes. I'm sure you have a lighter, Fred. - Here you are. - Yeah. Oh, don't be afraid. It's a lighter. - That's alright. See? - Yeah. Why, Fred, they can smoke. [chuckles] Oh, that's cute. My good man, your belt. - Five dollars, here. - Oh, yeah. He offers you five dollars. I heard him say five dollars, I think. Yes, yes, five dollars for you. But, oh, please, please don't put it on. I know that's a ridiculous price. Uh, we'll give you more. Oh, Fred, you oughta be ashamed of yourself. - Now you've insulted them. - Oh, I don't.. Why, that-that is solid silver, duckie. It's worth $20 of anybody's money. Oh, come on now, let me bargain with them. I can do better than you can. Hey, you. Big, big boy. - I-I'll give you $20. - Worth $40. What? Forty dollars? Why-- Oh, now, please. Just for Mabel, darling. I've got to have it, please. I want it for my bedroom, please. Ah, now.. Oh, say, give me the money. Let me bargain with them. I can do better than you can. Say, here, uh, uh, here's 20 and 20 is 40 dollars for your belt, huh? Oh, thanks, isn't it swell? - Oh, just look. - Well, you know what? I think maybe we got a bargain at that. Yes, sir, that looks like a real antique. Well, so long, boys. If you're ever in Cleveland, look me up. Alright. Goodbye, boys. [Mabel chuckles] [man coughs] [indistinct chatter] This great big smoke certainly make it a finer trade, grandfather. I very much like white man smoke. They make you feel good, I think. Yeah. [sighs] I just thought of something important. What is it, grandfather? I shall go to a quiet place. I want to be very sick. I, too. [singing in foreign language] Now, remember, you promised. Come on, let's go. Hi, Lily! How's business? Hello, Lily. [singing continues] Move on, get out of here. We don't want you here. You waste your talk. I stay. It is like a bonus. Come here again. We put her out last year. But this year I come with important friends. Yellow Singer, his wife. You cannot put me out. Yellow Singer and his wife? Yellow Singer is more important than any of your men. We ask him. Yellow Singer! They won't let me dance. Let the Slim Girl dance. It is Chief Yellow Singer who is speaks! They were great people in my father's time. If they brought her here, we cannot put her out. How much did she give you to bring her here? When you were born, I gave your mother sheepskins to keep you warm. [singing continues] Where did she get all of that hard stuff on her waist? She lives in Los Palos, they say. - Who are her people? - Dead. White man put her in his school. Yeah? [singing in foreign language] That Slim Girl, she makes me feel like a bolstering. [singing continues] She does nothing to me. [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] (Slim Girl) Hey! [giggling] I love boys who's afraid of girls. Give me back my blanket. What's the matter? You don't like me? I came here to sing, not to dance. But I wanna dance with you. And I don't want to dance with you. - But I want you. - But I don't want you. But I want you. Heh. - I won't dance. - Hm. Perhaps, you have the feet of a horse. Hm? Let's see. Let go, foolish feather-head. [chuckles] Why did you run so fast? Are you afraid of me? I'm not afraid of you. I can squeeze your neck as easily as I can squeeze a chicken's. Sometimes that is fun, too. What do you mean? There are no girls like me in north country. Are there? Hm? In my north country, a girl like you would be traded for barren sheep. Are you sure you're not all empty up there? You have never seen anyone like me before. Have you? No. I have never seen anyone like you.. ...before. Then, perhaps, there are other things you do not know. Happy things. Will you dance with me? Hm? I will dance one time. That's all. [chuckles] [singing in foreign language] Do you know that Paiute? Red Man? He only thinks he knows me. What was it he called you? Lily? You see, he's wrong. My name is Slim Girl. They used to call me Came With War. I like Slim Girl better. It suits you. I am Laughing Boy. I have not seen that suit you yet. Maybe later, huh? Come, let's dance. [singing continues] - What is the matter? - That is not dancing. - Don't you like to dance? - No. You move like a snake. It is not good. I only show you white man's dancing. Navajo way is better. How much shall I pay you to let me go? Twenty dollars. I name the money you have not got because I do not want you to go. I'll give you the $20 because I want to go very much. - I think. - Go then! I'll let you go for nothing because you're empty in the body, I think. I thought you were a man but your mother's milk still drips from you. You should be tied to a baby's board. You do not know a woman from a steer! Oh, you danced with the wrestler, huh? Why don't you pick me first? [singing in foreign language] Where are you going, grandfather? I'm going to pray. I can't think the way that is right. I'm going to pray to the gods that I may feel full inside again. It is not good. - Get out! - Why? Your dancing is bad. Come on, don't talk. Yellow Singer says I stay! No Navajo forget what Yellow Singer was but now, like you, he has gone the white man's way. I came here to be a Navajo again, tonight. Go! We do not want you here. [grunts] Hey, you come back to town with me, Lily? Go back to town with you, you Paiute? You are as bad as a white man.

[chuckling] What were you thoughts before I came? - Very beautiful thoughts. - Oh. - I am not beautiful then? - No. [laughs] Mm. Am I ugly? [instrumental music] - No. - Mm. [chuckles] I'm beautiful to you. - Your horse-- - Yes, my horse! I wish you go away. [chuckles] What a funny little man you are. [chuckles] I thought there was something the matter with your head.

Yoo-hoo-hoo. Now I know it. Now I know it. You should be tied to a baby board. [laughs] [horsemen yelling] [indistinct chatter] What do you bet, bush boy? [indistinct chatter] My horse, my silver and $40 that a fat white woman gave me for a bad belt. - Is that a bet? - Yes, I'd take it. You're making a foolish bet because of that girl. I bet to win that girl, heh, that stick. Get ready! [cheering] Start! [horses trotting] [dramatic music] [music continues] [crowd cheering] [music continues] [horse snorting] [crowd cheering] Are you hurt, grandfather? No! There is dust in my mouth. Now I'll put dust in that wrestler's liver. [crowd cheering] [indistinct chatter] Good race. You win, Red Man. That was a bad trick, I think. My horse shy, his horse got scared. [indistinct chatter] There is your horse, Paiute. Quiet Hunter. Give him his belt and his money. Your horse can't stand up, grandfather. Maybe I can sell him for dog food. You say you're a wrestler, Paiute? Many know that. Why? Will you bet everything that you just won from me that I cannot throw you in two straight falls? [laughs] I break you to pieces, grandfather. - I'll break your neck, Paiute. - Done, then. What do you bet? You got nothing to bet. My saddle and blanket. [chuckles] This silver. And my bowguard. (Red Man) 'Ha-ha. You bet the bowguard, huh?' It's a safe bet, Paiute. Jesting Squaw's Son, come here. [horses neighing] [indistinct chatter] [crowd cheering] [whistle blowing] [crowd cheering] And that throw is for my horse, Paiute. [crowd cheering] Choke him down, Laughing Boy! [crowd cheering] And that throw is for me, Paiute. That was a good trick, grandfather. Oh, yeah. [crowd cheering] [speaking in foreign language] [instrumental music] [water splashing] Move over, wrestler. Why do you stare at me like that? Why do you follow me? Perhaps, you're a pet goat. I only come to fill this water basket. You better fill it then, I think. Perhaps, you would do it for me. You would do it quicker. That is woman's work. You want me to go? Go or stay, my life will be the same. I just found out about you. 'I saw you throw that Red Man.' I was wrong about you last night. You're not a boy. You're a man. What will you do after this is over? Will you go back to the north country? You're like an old wife. Trying to find out everything about a man. I'm not like an old wife. No. You are not like an old wife. You will never be like that. You are different.. ...from anyone. To be different may be a good thing. How can I know? Is it different for a man to feel about a girl.. ...than what you feel about me now? I do not know. I only know that you're very beautiful. To be near you like this is like breathing in the desert flowers. I'm here, wrestler. Do you want me? To look once into your eyes.. ...is like walking through a lifetime of beauty. And yet you said "Go or stay, my life will be the same." That was a lie. I am glad it was a lie. My life will never be the same. I never want it to be the same again. Come. Where are we going, wrestler? Oh. Have you got your horse and saddlebags? Yes. Bring them and wait for me here. - Ah. - We're leaving this place. Alright. My uncle. I have been thinking about a wife. That is good. The Earth should sow its seed. Young men should marry. You're my nearest relative here and I wanted to ask your permission. That is good. Do you know this, uh, Slim Girl? The one we stopped from dancing? Oh, that's nothing. We like each other. We want to marry. I have heard of her. Her people are dead. She's not of us anymore. She lives by the railroad in Las Palos. And she does bad things. You say she's bad and I say she's different. To be different is not always a bad thing. It is true that she knows of white men's ways. But why should that always be bad? You need not marry her. All she wants is your silver. You have let a toad jump out of your mouth. I hope it will follow you always. It doesn't matter. I shall marry her, anyway.

No, there is water in the next canyon. We shall stop there. [instrumental music] In my house in Las Palos, I have a stove. None of that trouble. You couldn't carry a stove on a horse, I think. Oh. Oh, no. I don't want to. Have you ever seen a house, wrestler? - Uh-huh. - 'A house with windows?' Uh-huh. I have seen the trading post. [laughs] Aw, you should see my house. I have curtains in the windows. I have a box with music. I have a string that you pull and it makes daylight in a glass bowl hanging in the ceiling. So.. I have heard about all those things. Oh, uh, by your house have you seen one of those, uh, iron-fire drives? Oh, a train? - With engine and cars? - Uh-huh. One goes by in back of my house every day. It goes, whoo, whoo..

And I will show you much of the north country, too. In three more days, my father and mother will greet you in their hogan. We shall find a singer to make prayers for us. And in four more days we can get married. A singer? Praying for us? You speak about marriage? Yes. Perhaps, you have forgotten, but that's the Navajo way. It's a very beautiful way, I think. Why do you look at me like that? Three days.. Then four days.. A night. Oh, Laughing Boy.. ...it's a long time to wait. Um, I-I, I think I'll-I'll sleep on the other side of the tree so if you call me, I can hear you. Oh, wait, wait. Wrestler, wait. Well, but you'll be so far away from the fire. I give you something to keep you warmer. Come here, come on. Sit here, sit here, come on. No, no. Sit here, sit here. Come on. No, no. Put your leg this side. Here, that's it. Come on. [chuckles] Here. This will keep you warm. Here, drink it. Come on, drink it. It's good. Come on, drink it. [burps] Take more, take more. More. [sighs] How do you think, wrestler, huh? It's whiskey, I think. - Moonshine. - From the moon? [chuckles] A man must find that out, those things, by himself. Come on, drink more. That is true. [clears throat] It isn't the moon. It's the desert sun that-that crawl into my belly. [chuckles] It is nice, the desert sun. It is a soft flame sometimes at night. It's strange, this whiskey. Makes me feel funny up here. [sighs] But it's good. [chuckles] If that puts craziness into the head.. ...I like craziness, I think. It put happiness in the body. - Make me some more. - No. For now you've had enough. Come. Come over and rest here. - Come on, lay down. - Oh, n-no, I have to sleep on-- Oh, but you must. After you have a drink.. - I'm warm now. - You must rest. But you must rest. Come on. Come over and rest and I'll fix you another one. Hm? Come on. Oh, I fix you up. Now put your head here. Come on. [sighs] Oh. I want to sing. I want to sing nice songs. Let's sing nice songs together.

[indistinct chatter] A three-cents stamp, please. Lily, who do you find to write to? - You never get any mail. - Maybe I write to you. - Hey, don't do that. - Well, I gotta be going. I've gotta leave for the ranch as soon as the horses are showered. I'll be seein' you. And get this, you slant-eyed little squaw. Don't you ever go hoppin' off to a dance again when you know I'm in town. Your glass is empty again. And if you ever leave me standin' around this dirty town in and out of that post office there's gonna be one mighty, sick, little Indian girl. Your glass is full again. 'I should have been back at the ranch two days ago.' 'Got a bunch of weevil-faced sheepherders' 'you can't trust the length of your arm.' Well, why don't you go? 'It's been three long weeks' 'since I've seen you, Lily.' Say, what's the matter with you? Oh, I don't know. Maybe I feel tired. 'Say, you've been that way all afternoon.' 'I'm getting sick of it.' You know, you're acting mighty changed since you went to that dance. Don't think you're the only girl in Los Palos. There are lots of girls who'd be glad to be nice to me. Well, go to them. Go to them and leave me alone. You know, I've, I've sent for three nice, new silk dresses for you and lots of other things. Oh, please. Say, what's eating you? Don't I always give you everything you want? I pay for this house, don't I? Ain't I good to you? Don't I give you all the money you want? Oh, leave me alone and go to the other girls. I hate you! Ow! [sobbing] [sobbing] Lily. Lily. [sobbing] Lily. I didn't mean that. You made me mad the way you acted. Lily, I want to do everything to make you happy. Oh, George, do as you like.

My Slim Girl. ♪ Blue skies ♪ ♪ Whisper my love to you ♪ ♪ Blue waters ♪ ♪ Sing of you ♪ ♪ My heart is gay ♪ ♪ It sings today ♪ ♪ Awake ♪ ♪ This is my call ♪ ♪ Of love ♪♪ [instrumental music] Laughing Boy. This is magic. I am not magic. I.. I had to come. If you send me away, I shall die. But it does not matter. To have seen you again... is good. Shall I go? No. No, my Slim Girl. No. You were right when you ran away from me. I was bad. I didn't care. I was glad to be bad. It was my way. But you have made me want to be good again. Have I been so bad.. ...I never can be good again? [sighs] Look. The new moon. Our badness died with the old moon. Come. I'll take you to my people now. Oh, no. No, please. I'm afraid. I'm afraid they have heard the bad things about me. It doesn't matter. We will be married. My mother will take you as a daughter because I say you are good. [cow bells chiming] [instrumental music] [grunting] Hey ya, Slim Girl. Come and see the horses we've caught. How are you, my mother? It has been a good week. Many horses. So I see, my son. Where is Slim Girl? She is not here. She has not gone while I've been away? - No, not far. - But where? She won't be here today. Your mother told her she must kill the next goat. She is never here when there's a goat to be killed. Where is the goat? I will kill it. That's woman's work. Slim Girl has been married three months. It's time for her to learn these things. - I have told her so. - She does many things well. You have said so yourself, my mother. Some things she does well. Does she stay away when there, there are skins to beat water to fetch, wood to gather, corn to plant? No, she tries to do these things but, my son, you married a woman who can never weave a blanket. Slim Girl's hands and thoughts are not ours. - They can never be. - You are wrong. She can do anything, that girl. Wait till I find her and I'll show you. Move over, wrestler. Oh. Heh. Why are you crying? Oh. It is nothing. [sniffles] I have been trying to pray. But now you're here.. ...I don't have to pray. [sniffles] You pray for me, Laughing Boy. I want to be a good Navajo. I do. If you try to weave a blanket it would please my mother. Will that make you happy, too, my husband? Even if it isn't so good? It will come in time, my Slim Girl. I have tried. - You have? - Yes. Come, I will show you. [instrumental music] Soon after our marriage I set up a loom in the cedars here. I couldn't work with eyes on me. [sighs] I said to myself "It is in my blood to make a blanket. Came With War can make a blanket as anyone." Each day you went to the mesa I came here. And now look at this thing. Where are your wool cards? Here. Then.. Oh, then.. [chuckles] See, all it needed was a strong hand to pull it together. Mm-hmm. It is like my life, this blanket. Then it is a good life. It is a good blanket. I've never seen this design before. Did you make it up yourself? [giggling] Mm-hmm. This design is like you. It breaks all rules but it is beautiful. Come, let's show it to my mother. Oh. [goat bleating] [speaking in foreign language] (Laughing Boy) See, my mother? Did you say my wife couldn't weave a blanket? - No woman wove this blanket. - This woman did. (Laughing Boy) 'Is it a good blanket or is it not, my mother?' (Laughing Boy's mother) 'It is good for a first blanket.' But it is as a man thinks, not as a woman. The blanket is bold. [goat bleating] Why do you fear to kill goat? I...I do not fear to do it. - Then, here is the knife. - Oh, no, no. (Slim Girl) 'Oh, please, please don't ask me to do it.' (Laughing Boy's mother) 'It is all in the work of a hogan.' [goat bleating] [goat bleating] I can't do it. I just can't do it! I will remember the killing! I'm sick, every day of watching a goat going to the pond where this blood is still fresh! I just can't do it! You have lived the life of a white woman too long. Our ways will never be your ways. Well, why don't you let me do other work? Clean the hogan, hang the blankets in the sun. Let me dig all the soft weed. Let me fetch all the water, anything you want but just that, I can't do it. Oh. This is your marriage, my son. Take the meat to my hogan. I will kill it. [goat bleating] [goat bleating] [sobbing] I'm sorry, Laughing Boy. I have tried. There are some things.. ...I cannot do yet. I know. I know. Oh, Laughing Boy, let's go far away. Build a hogan of our own. Then it might be, we could keep our happiness always. We must wait before we can build a hogan of our own. At least two years before I can ask my share of my father's sheep. - Laughing Boy. - What? - Laughing Boy. - What is it? I will get us sheep. We cannot get sheep without silver. - And I have very little of it. - I have silver. Much silver and turquoise. You have seen it. It doesn't mean to me anything now. In Los Palos, I will trade it for money to buy sheep. - In Los Palos? - Uh-huh. Now is the season for white visitors. I will make them pay very big prices for my silver stuff. Oh, I never heard of a wife who traded. I am a different wife. You have said so once. You have said, "To be different is not a bad thing to be." Yes. I said that once. Oh, let me be that way always. Let our happiness be different, too. If we stay here, soon there'll be no difference between me and any Navajo squaw. And I wanted that people shall always say "That Laughing Boy, he must have magic. His wife does not grow old and fat like other squaws." And, Laughing Boy, in two years we shall have more horses, more sheep, more silver than anyone in the north Blue country. We shall build a white-man house, if we like with a stove to cook on and a bed to sleep in, huh? [laughing] Why do you laugh? It'd be very strange, I think, to sleep on a bed. Beds are soft, my hair is soft. The night breeze is soft. You like 'em both. Was there ever such a woman like you? I.. Heh. I may go, huh? Tomorrow? If you think it best to go.. ...go. Yes. It is best for our life together. You will see, my husband. It is best. [chuckles] Oh. [knocking on door] [speaking in foreign language] - 'Takora!' - Eh? (Slim Girl) 'Open the door.' 'Come on.' [Yellow Singer snoring] Drunk again, huh? Well, here I am in Los Palos again. - Hm. - Give me a cigarette. I thought you would come back again one day. You're a town Indian. Life out there's too hard for you, eh? Once it was the right life for an Indian. For him, for you, for me. But the white man spoiled that life. We three are alike. There's a mountain between us and our people. Look at him. (Slim Girl) 'Chief of a great race.' He learned the white man's way. He ate the white man's bread. And look at him. And look at me! My name is Came With War. They make two of me. I bring two beds. Think two ways. [sighs] How can I walk in beauty? How can I? They pay those white men for what they done to me. What are you going to do? That house I had does that Hartshorne still lives there? When he's in town, he stays there. He's very rich now, that Hartshorne. He sold much land to the railroad. That Rosie stays with him. She was in the American school where you were, you remember? Oh, Rose. Hmph! They quarrel always. He remembers you, I think. [sighs] He shall remember me.. ...always. [train chugging] Get away, will you? Or maybe you'd like I make you a drink? Well, I wish you'd do something. [train horn blaring] Hello, Rosie. Hello, Georgie. [chuckles] Well.. You got it fixed up pretty good. Yes. Pretty good. Cost a lot, Georgie, eh? What the devil are you doing here? Why am I here? Maybe I got lonesome for you, George. I don't know. Beat it, Rosie. Beat it! [chuckles] If you spoke to me that way I will kill you. But you wouldn't speak to Lily that way, would you, George? Hm. You don't look so good. Too much whiskey, I think. You have missed me? You've got a nerve coming back here after the way you left me. Sure, I got nerve, but I'm back. I know by your eyes that you're glad to see me. But I must hear you say it. They tell me you got married. Is that right? Yes. Slim Girl is married. But Lily's here. Oh, come on, say it. Say you're glad to see me. Come on. Say it. Please. I got to admit it to you. Alaho to my father. Alaho to my mother. - Alaho to my mother. - Alaho to my son. It's been 12 months since I've seen you. How is everything in the north country, my father? Well, well. You did not come to see us, my son. I thought that trouble had come to you. Trouble, my mother? Look at my horses. Our fat sheep, our big corral. Does it look as if we are in trouble? But come, my mother, let me help you. But you did not come to see us, my son. I couldn't, my mother. My wife has been away. I had to take care of the sheep and the horses. - Where is your wife? - In Los Palos. She's a different wife, that one. She comes and goes. - Why, my son? - She goes there to trade. Go in to the hogan and see what her trading has given us. Here, my mother, sit. See all the new things that Slim Girl has brought. A chair. [sighs] No, my son. The earth is more gentle. Yes, my mother. Um.. An-an-and, uh, here is a bed with four legs. Like a horse. And soft, too. And the other blanket's white, soft as wool. - Do you sleep on it? - Oh, no. It squeaks sometimes when you turn and wakes you up. And besides, it sinks in the middle, too. But it looks pretty in the hogan, I think. Um, the earth is more gentle. Hey, yeah, we're all too sad, I think. Out of that box with music I'm going to play you a funny chant. It's all about a boy who is half man and half horse.

Come, grandfather. - See? - Hm. They are all fat. There is no sickness among them. You have too many sheep for one year, I think. Your sheep must have a lamb every moon for you to have so many. Oh, no, I bought them from the white trader with the money that Slim Girl brings back from Los Palos for the silver work I make. - She must be a good trader. - Uh-huh. A man should raise his own sheep. You dream trouble, grandfather? Every time she goes away, I miss her so. And when she comes back I want to speak with her about all these things but she does not want to listen to the serious word. She only wants to whisper and laugh and be a young wife. And I cannot help but whisper and laugh with her because every time I miss her so. But this time she stays away too long. Maybe she stays for the Fourth of July for the big thing. I should like to go there and bring her back with me but I cannot leave the horses and the sheep. Well, I'm here. I'll take care of the horses and sheep. My friend. That girl and I we have never had a holiday together. If I speak with her about all these things away from the hogan maybe everything will be well again. Uh? Oh. [band music] [firecracker crackling] [indistinct chatter] [firecrackers crackling] [music continues] [whirring] [laughs] Popcorn, Navajo? - What's that? - Popcorn. It's good. [firecrackers crackling] - Good. - Crazy hot? Mm-hmm. Do you know Slim Girl? No, I don't know. I thought maybe you would. She's a good trader here. Yeah, yeah? I don't know. Hey, you ain't gonna pay me? - What's the matter with you? - Popcorn! Come on, Lily, let's get comfortable. What's eating you? Oh, it isn't late. - Let's go back to town. - What, again? Didn't you see all there was to see once tonight? - Yes. - What do wanna go again for? Oh, I don't know. I just feel like moving, that's all. Come on, have a drink. You'll feel better. [chuckles] No. I got drunk on ice cream tonight. Six dishes. Three more than you bet I could eat. Now, three dollars, please? Come on. Ha-ha. You're getting to be a mighty expensive baby. Hm. Well, you work hard for your money. You should have fun. I'm your fun, eh? Oh, thank you. Gee, I hate to leave you, baby. Why don't you go back to the ranch with me tomorrow, Lily? You're not afraid for people to know about you and me anymore? Well I should say not. I'm a big shot now. When I want anything bad enough, I don't care what people think. - Come along? - No. I already stay in Los Palos too long this time. (Hartshorne) 'Oh, well, I'm not jealous of every Indian husband.' 'But I often wonder.' 'Doesn't he ever ask any questions?' I told you, so long as my husband has plenty of silver and turquoise to work with plenty of money to buy ship he don't ask any questions where I go, where I come. - Me very cold-- - Oh, keep away. Go away. Leave me alone. [indistinct chatter] Now leave me alone. [band music] I know you. You're Yellow Singer. Slim Girl's friend. [speaking in foreign language] Uh-huh. Can you take me to Slim Girl? I'll give you money if you do. Slim Girl is not in Los Palos, she has gone. The old blind girl, I saw her. Tsk, tsk. You see things from whiskey. Come. - One dollar. - Two dollar. - After you show me to her. - Come. [music on record] Are you gonna play that thing all night? - You devil. - Hah! [laughing] Surprise. Wait, that stuff is good. I will buy some for Slim Girl. One of those. Yeah? - How much? - Ten cents. [firecracker crackling] [music on record] You know it's getting late. - What are you stalling about? - Tsk. I'm waiting. - Waiting? For what? - Mm-hmm. For you to remember something that you forgot. - Forgot? What? - Mm-hmm. Well, something. A little book. - Book? Book? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, you mean bank book? - Yes! Huh! I didn't forget. - Ooh! - Oh. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Look. Deposit and everything. Oh! Ho! - She lives there. - Oh. Oh! Yes. Here it is. - Here I come. - No, no, stay there. No, I come to you. Wait a minute. One, two and three. Here I come. Yoo-hoo! Ha-ha! [gasps] Hey, what's the matter with you? Lily, what is the matter? Lily? What do you want? Who are you? What are you doing here? What are you gonna do with that? [groans] [clatters] [Slim Girl groaning] [groaning] [groans] Don't. Oh, don't, don't. It was going too deep.. ...I think. I didn't mean the arrow for you. Don't look at me like that. Quick. Before the darkness comes.. ...would you get a little closer? Closer so I can see you. What I did with him has nothing to do with what I did with you. It was only so I could make our two ways.. ...work together in unity. Now you know it. It is a good thing I die. No, no, my Slim Girl.. ...do not die. It is best, I think. The white man has spoiled the way for me. Two gods cut me in two pieces. Always I breathe two breaths. I think two ways. I knew too much.. ...and too little. I was too hard and too soft. Too bad and too good. I did not want you to...to know that you have married a woman who feared the work of a hogan. That's why.. ...I did this evil thing. You...you cannot.. You can never understand I think. I think I understand. You tried to cheat the gods a little.. ...so that we could be happy much. But they won't be angry with you. They will only think "Poor little Slim Girl. She missed the way." Laughing Boy.. ...kiss me, kiss me. [sobbing] I will.. I go to my people now. I wait for you...there. [instrumental music] Oh. Oh. [music continues] Yes, my Slim Girl.. ...wait for me. Wait for me there. ♪ O-o-oh oh ♪ ♪ O-o-oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh ♪♪ [instrumental music]
