Have a nice day. Pokua! Pokua! ? Let me tell you. She has to know. It's none of your business! If there's any trouble, I am not part of it, I told you to not to do it. It's not. Please go. Do you understand? What? Okay, just... I had nothing to do with this. If there's any trouble, I- She has to know. Just go. Hey, hey! Hi, Pokua. How are you doing? - Very well. - Yeah. Come on, come on in. - No. - No. Auntie Vero, I suspect your husband is cheating on you. I didn't like what I saw today. I thought you should know so you can keep an eye on him. Auntie Vero, maybe you didn't hear what I said. Oh, I heard you. That's no news. So many people tell me this all the time, but he denies them all. It does haunt me, but I have no proof so I just pretend that it's not happening and that's how I deal. Auntie Vero, we're so sorry. Eh? Congratulations, reporter. There must be something we can do. Listen, Pokua, this woman is suffering enough torture already, leave her alone! Yes, she is. Yes, she is. But that's why I want to help. We need to free her mind. She has to know the truth. Free her mind from what? Truth, truth. Everyday, truth. What truth, Pokua? You're the only one who knows this truth. Pokua, let's just leave her be. I mean, she's living her life- Eh? She's happy. Pokua, what else do you want? She's not who? She's not happy. Didn't you see the way she talks? The way she banged her door? She's definitely not happy. Look, I'm a married woman too. - Oh. - Eh. Okay. I see it when another is in trouble. I see it. Okay, madam married woman, tell us, what should we do to help? I heard him say he'll pick her tomorrow at 2:00. We can go with Auntie Vero so she finds out. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Hey, no! - No. - Leave me out of this. - Mm-hmm. This is insane. I want no part of this. Do you understand? Count me out. Did you think about this? Pokua, she's right. That's such a... That's an awful idea. That's the only thing on my mind. I don't know how to give her proof. But maybe there's something else we can do. Okay, okay, okay. How do we get proof? Pokua, do you know what you're asking for? Yes, I do. Are you that heartless? No, I am not! I am not. How did we even become friends? Babs! Oh, oh, you too, you agree with this, eh? Not entirely, but you people shouting and screaming, it's not going to solve anything. Just bring your voices down. Okay. I understand how this is a problem for you. I can handle it myself. Help is all I want to give. Pokua! I'll go. She's right. I mean, it's gonna cause a whole lot of drama and you don't want that scene. But I have an idea. I mean, if it's really going to help her, maybe we can just record him secretly. If we get him like once or twice on camera, that's proof, right? Hmm. Hmm. You have money for camera? Oh, we can use our phone camera. Our phone camera will be fine. And that easy, right? Just gonna record him? It was just a suggestion, like... Hmm. Okay, if you wish not to be in, fine, we carry on. Baaba? Baab? Baaba? See, look, eh, my next friendship, yeah, I'm going to make sure that there's a contract so I can get out whenever I feel like it without any guilt. Ah, this friendship thing is hard. And now by force, I have to go and do this thing and I don't want to do. No! Next time, I'm serious, we are signing contracts so I can get out. It's okay. And this better be worth it. . Go! Guys! Hey, I want the front. I want the front. Give me the front! Front! V, what is going on here? What's happening? Jesus. Stand here and talk to me. V, look at you. Sweetheart, what has you working you up like this? Are you cheating on me? What? Oh, , . Sweetheart, did you just ask that? I've lost count of the many times you've asked this question. Just answer me. Are you cheating? No! How could I? Never. Tell me, where from this? , I told you that the next time I get a report that you're cheating on me, I won't ask for proof, I will just walk away. Too many people can't be reporting the same lie. It's just not possible. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Sweetheart, it means someone came to report me again? I see. And are you breaking your mind because of what you have not seen? Goodness! I've asked you to stop listening to people because they envy our marriage. In case you want to walk out of this maybe 'cause you are tired of me, then so be it, but don't blame it on unfounded hearsay. Sweetie, when I step out there, there are a lot of pretty girls, even some of them are married women who try to hit on me but I refuse them. You know why? It's because I respect our marriage. Unless I forget, what do we have for dinner? This is the plan, the two of you will do the recording. I can't be part, he'll recognize me. When his car arrives, walk towards it and pretend to chat. But hold on. So how would you have pulled this off if we pulled out? I haven't thought about that. I know you'll never leave me. Hmm? The lady will come from here. Turn your backs towards them and hold your phones casually. No direct cameras. See, this thing is very risky. I can't believe we're about to do this. I can't believe I got myself involved in this. Baaba! I thought we all agreed that we're gonna do this. And I'm not saying I'm pulling out, I'm just telling you that it's risky. He's here. He's here. And Fella, you first. Okay. Let's go. Baaba? Yeah? When the lady's approaching the car, call her, she'll stop, get closer and start a conversation. Okay. Get closer. Get closer. Okay, okay, okay. I'm going. I'm going. Fella! Baabs! Oh my goodness! How are you? I'm great. Baabs, how long has it been? Ah, it's been a very long time. - Many years. - Yes! You're looking good. Oh, thank you, it's through the grace of God. Oh, gosh. - Yeah, okay- - Yeah. So I came for a walk. A walk? Yes. Yes, it's very breezy, yeah. Yeah, it's nice, plenty birds- Yeah. - Lots of air. - Oh. Yeah. - Ah. - Oh, Fella! Baabs, oh. Yeah, Fella. It's good to see you. - Oh, good to see you too. - Yeah. Good to see you. Baabs. What? - They kissed. - They what? No, no, no, no, no, not here. Where did they kiss? On the lips, mwah, mwah. On the lips? Really? - Mm-hmm. - What- They kissed. And look. They kissed! Auntie Vero, we caught him, your husband. We have a proof of him cheating. Why are you doing this? I'm a wife too. I can't stand the torture of hearing my husband is cheating. I thought I should expose him to free your conscience. I don't like it when you see wrong and go quiet. Let me see it. Okay, okay, show, show. Looking good. Oh, thank you, it's through the grace of God. Oh, God. Auntie Vero? - For a walk. - A walk? - Yeah. - Please, are you okay? Plenty birds, yeah. Yeah. Auntie Vero, please say something. Do you think we made her cry? No. She decided to cry on her own. She saw a video of her husband cheating and cried. Look, look guys, let's just... Let's just go, okay? I mean, clearly the woman is in a lot of pain, let's give her some space. This was a bad idea. Here, have this. What for? It's your reward. Oh, no, no, no. No, Auntie Vero, you don't have to pay us. Mm-hmm. You know, anyone could have done this for me too. I've been so unhappy the past three years, so thank you for giving me this freedom. I'm just tired of living in oblivion. And here, put the video on this. Just put it on. - Miss, we are so sorry. - Sorry, Auntie Vero. We're sorry. Thank you, through the grace of God. We may go now. We shouldn't of done this. Oh, okay. So I came for a walk. - A walk? - Yes. It's nice, plenty birds- - Yeah. - Lots of air. - Oh! - Yeah. V? V! V for Vero. V! Honey, I'm home! Where's this wife? VV! V, darling! Ah. Thank you, through the grace of God. Oh, gosh. - Yeah, okay- - Yeah. So I came for a walk. - A walk? - Yes. Yes, it's very breezy, yeah. Yeah, it's nice, there's plenty birds- - Yeah. - Lots of- ♪ Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it ♪ This is a lot of money. Yeah, it is. We should split it. Yeah, everybody takes their cut. I mean, whatever you wanna do with it is your business, but- No, no, no. No, no. Let's open a proper ushering agency, you know, with a registered office and everything. Think about it, Pokbafell. Vuh. The F is silent. Vuh. You know what, it makes sense. Yeah. Pokua, are you here? Of course, I'm here. Okay, so what's your take? I think I need some time to think through. Okay, let's all take some time to think through. Yep. But you know what? I think it's perfect. Yes! Ow! Honey? Get my phone! Yeah. Um-mm. Not ready. Hi, is this Pokua? That smells good. Shh, shh. Yes, Pokua here. Vero tells me you helped her catch her cheating husband. Can you help me too? Pardon? I suspect my husband is cheating. I want proof to face him. A friend also suspects her boyfriend, she needs your help. Hello? Hello? No, no, no way! No way we're getting into something like that, Pokua. No! I told you she was crazy. Did you believe me? No, I am not. Come on guys. Okay, look at it this way, if we treat this as business, we are going to expose a lot of cheating husbands and boyfriends. And if they pay for our service, it's a lot of money. Think about it. Lots of money to make. Then what happens to Pokbafell? The ushered business is nothing to us. It makes us nothing. For how long? We just keep trying. We need to try something different. And getting into people's private lives, that's your solution, Pokua? I mean, what kind of job is that? What? Our work will be very simple. If you suspect your partner is cheating on you, just tell us about it. We give you a proof, you pay us. Easy, huh? Easy, huh? It doesn't sound easy, huh? Not one bit, huh? You know what I think? I mean, she's crazy. She's insane-o but... I'm game. I mean, we don't have a choice, right? Yeah, me too. I mean, if it's going to make us money, let's do it. - Yeah! - Brilliant! Going after the side chicks. - Yes! - Mm-hmm. - Get the bad ones. - Yeah. We're the good cops. It's so funny. Maybe we can name it Side Chick Task Force? Huh? That don't sound... Why is there a police unit? - What else? - Wait, wait. Let me think. Instead of task force, let's put gang. Yes! Gang! SideChic Gang! - Pa-pow! - Poo-ooh! Pa-pow! SideChic Gang. Okay, good. SideChic Gang. Wait, let me help you. SideChic Gang. Draah! Draah! Skraah! Go, go. Is it... Is it... Yes, it is. Okay. Okay. Now, office supplies. Yeah. Two cameras. Hmm, and a printer. Papers and stamps. Office table, office chairs, TV? - TV. - Yes. Office chair. And a fan. No, no, AC. But wait, wait, wait. Pokua, wait. I mean, I think we should hold on on this list. Why? Get an office first. Too expensive. Guys, guys. Hurry up. For rent. Oh. 03-02-123-231. Hello. Hi. We saw a structure you're renting. We want it. Okay. What do you think they do there? I think they find young girls for old men. Eh? Hi, welcome. Thank you. How may I assist you? Well, I am told you arrange young, sweet looking, beautiful girls for old men. Can you help me? And who told you that? My friend. I'm sorry, we don't offer such services here. Oh. So, what do you do? We help women catch their cheating husbands. Yes, like the side chick police. Oh, sorry, my friend lied to me. I apologize for that. But you see in case you start my kind of service, remember me. You look great. Yes. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Bye. Hi. Welcome. Hi, we spoke, yeah.

I refuse to believe that he was cheating on me even when I found condoms hidden that's where his spare tire is, I blamed the mechanic. Last night he didn't come home. I called him this morning. He said he went on an impromptu trip. He'll be back tomorrow. His phone went off, that's why he couldn't call to tell me.

Yeah, someone will handle your payment. Did you enjoy seeing your husband with another woman? You are happy destroying marriages for money. We helped you find your cheating husband. You should pay us. Is that not what you do? You see, that lady is not my fiance. I don't know her. But thanks for your service. I admire your speed. Have a good day. O- okay. Okay. Hmm? - It's okay? - You okay? Let's go back to. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. No, I'm fine. Please, have a seat. So, talk to us. I suspect my boyfriend is cheating on me. My friends say he hangs out with a woman, which obviously isn't me. I can't remember the last time we went out together. It's been over a year. Wow. Mm-hmm. I will need you to help me. I want to know if he's seeing someone else. Okay. Are you okay? Um... Is-is-is this your-your boyfriend? Yes. How long have you been together? Three years. Any problem? Um, no. No problem. This is just the regular background check. Oh. So are you gonna help me? - Yeah, sure. - Hmm. We'll help you. Splendid. So I will await your feedback. Baaba? Hmm? Hey, Baaba, there must be some explanation to this. No, it's hot. - Baaba? - Hmm? Oh, wow. Babe, are you okay? No, I'm fine. Are you sure? No, I'm very fine.

There's a six month salary to take care of you whilst you find another job. I know how angry you are. I messed up. No excuse can restore you. I'm so sorry. I just needed you a little more, but you were always gone. I've been angry and I even wanted to break up, but I changed my thoughts 'cause I don't want to lose you. A lot of things changed when you started this SideChic Gang business. You leave home before I'm awake and you return when I'm asleep. I mean, it was just crazy spending all those nights alone. It almost felt like I was single again. I was frustrated, I couldn't concentrate at work, so I started doing crazy stuff. Howcome we never spoke about this? I didn't know how you would take it. My friends told me that's how to calm myself down and I listened to them. I am so sorry. I want my wife back. I love you so much. I need you to spend a little more time with me, please. I don't want this to end. Finally responding to my calls and messages. So now you know why I'm not responding to your calls and messages. Maybe I got tired of being a side chick.

That is the only thing left. Look, I'm done with this. I work so hard for us. Oh, you think that is easy? I work hard too. Very hard. But I still find time for you! You are so obsessed with yourself, your work and the numerous business meetings. Maybe you should start dating them. Mm-hmm. They'll be better girlfriends than me. I'm sorry! So, so this is what I deserve, right? I have an idea. Girls, it took too much courage for us to set up SideChic Gang. We can't just let it die just like that. There must be something that we can do different. So, I was thinking that instead of using SideChic Gang to fight side chicks, maybe we should use it to counsel couples, you know, to help them prevent it. Look, I know we've had our own share of harsh lessons, but let's use our experiences. Let's use it to tell these couples what to do to keep their partners, save their relationships, their marriages, their homes, and the end result, there'll be no more need for side chicks or side dudes or anything like that. So, what do you think? Brilliant. Yeah. Come here. Oh! So, how may we help you? My husband has not been the man I married lately. You know, so many things changed. I think he doesn't find me attractive anymore. I used to be the only thing he ever dreamt of, but now, he's unbothered. I see why I don't exist. It hurts. Truly hurts. I feel he's finding another woman beautiful somewhere. Please, I need you to help me. I want to know if there's someone in his life. What were the things you did together when you were the only thing he needed in his life? We even went to watch movies, went on dinner dates and shopping. Why did that stop? Well, personally, I feel we were growing up and it was time to leave some of such things, so I took a break. So when's the last time he said something nice to you? Yesterday. Wait, wait, look. It's nice if he means the nice things he says and that's the problem. And when was the last time you said something nice to him? Hmm... I can't recall. I can't remember. Look, see, my husband is very annoying, trust me. You wouldn't like him when you meet him. Anytime I thought to say something nice, he ruined it. What did he do? Uh... Are there that many? Oh, yeah. A lot of them. I can't even remember. I can't even think of one. And have you tried talking to him to find out what the problem is? I did not. I mean, I'm scared it will upset him. Ma'am, it's hard for us to tell you if your husband is cheating or not. First, you stopped doing the things that sparked up your relationship, the dinner, the movies, the shopping. It's a terror. All because you felt too old for them. And he started seeing you as an old, boring woman without spark. That aside, he still compliments you, but you do not. I think you're creating your own side chick. Get rid of her before she takes away your marriage. Okay. How much do I owe? It's a free service, but we'll charge you for your next appointments. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah
