Turn, turn. There's the sign. Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we're finally here. Oh, wait. I told Shane I'd text him once we're almost there. Oh, Mitchie... - What? - Nothing, nothing. Mom, obviously it's something. I mean, you and subtle aren't very good friends. I know you and Shane talk all the time, but, you know, it's... You actually haven't seen this boy in almost a year. I just don't want you to be too disappointed if he can't come to camp this summer. Mom. I want you to have fun and focus on your music. Okay, first off, this is gonna be the best summer ever. And second, nothing can make me lose my focus. What is that? Did somebody open another camp? Seriously, why would somebody open up another camp across the lake? Oh, who knows, but I don't think it's anything to worry about. - Caitlyn! - Mitchie! - Hi! - Caitlyn! - How are you? - I'm great. - Let me take this for you. - Thank you. I was so afraid that we weren't gonna get here in time, - but doesn't look like many are here. - You know what this means. Since we're the first ones here, we totally get our choice of... ...bunk. I bet you sounded fantastic. Yeah? Oh, my gosh. Well, I guess no one cares about my life. What don't we know? I mean, you update your status, like, every two seconds. Fine. - I have a question, and it's for Mitchie. - For me? So, what's going on with you and Shane? - Nothing is going on. - That's a total lie. You guys are obsessed. No, seriously. I don't know, I just... I feel like if we never get to spend any time together, then nothing is ever gonna happen. Just one more crank and I think I got it. That's good. Can we please just wait for the tow truck? Oliver tried and he couldn't get it. That's because Oliver's not properly motivated. He's not trying to get to Camp Rock before Mitchie. We should have never taken that shortcut. Maybe because Oliver doesn't even know Mitchie. Thanks. It's gonna be really cool. I got it all planned. She'll walk in, and I'll be sitting there, and I'll say, "Hey, Mitchie." She's gonna be so surprised. "Hey, Mitchie"? That's your big line? Trust me. Everything's cool when I do it. I'm just excited to finally spend some time with her. - Oh, here you go. - Is this from the tire? Yeah. I saw it on the ground. Thought it was important, so I put it in my pocket. Why didn't you tell me earlier? How could I have told you if I didn't remember until now? It's fine. Just one bolt, right? - We good? - Yeah. - Please. - No. - Oh, please, don't. No, no, no. - No! No! No, no, no! Told you it was important. Where is everybody? I know, right? There's, like, barely anybody out there. I sure hope you've got something we can do at opening jam. Because if not, I've got nothing. Kind of, maybe, sort of. I don't know. l-- - Can we hear it? - Sing it. Okay. - It's not finished. - It's okay. Come on. - Not anything special. - Come on. Last year's old news I'm breakin' out my six-string And playin' from my heart - That is amazing. - I love it. Really? Thank you. That's all I got so far. I have a lot of lyrics, but the music's not really worked out yet. Maybe we could just sing the first part over and over again. - That's it. - Really? Nobody ever agrees with me. - Barron! Sander! - Hey, what's up? - Hey. - Hi, how you doing? - Play it again. - For you, Mitchie? Anything. Let's rock. Last year's old news I'm breakin' out my six-string And playin' from my heart It's not déjà vu 'Cause it's another summer That's how this chapter starts I'm gonna run so fast till I can't breathe Come along and follow me Let's make some noise We never did before It's a brand-new day Don't you see me? Changing all my ways So completely This time I'm gonna sing And you're gonna hear it This time I'm gonna show you That I got the spirit It's a brand-new day And I'm feelin' good And I'm feelin' good So drama-free I'm all about the music I just wanna sing Watch me live out my dreams I'm gonna rock that stage And give my everything I'm gonna dance until my feet can't move Come along, get in the groove Let's shine so bright More than we did before It's a brand-new day Don't you see me? Changing all my ways So completely This time I'm gonna sing And you're gonna hear it This time I'm gonna show you That I got the spirit It's a brand-new day And I'm feelin' good What you gonna do? What you gonna do? I'm gonna laugh Through the summer with you Who you gonna be? Who you gonna be? You'll just have to watch me carefully Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? Anywhere my heart wants me to go I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance I'm gonna write, I'm gonna play I'm gonna try my hand in everything 'Cause it's a brand-new day Don't you see me? Changing all my ways So completely This time I'm gonna sing And you're gonna hear it This time I'm gonna show you That I got the spirit It's a brand-new day It's a brand-new day It's a brand-new day It's a brand-new day Changing all my ways - I'm changing all my ways - This time I'm gonna sing And you're gonna hear it - Gonna hear it - That I got the spirit Got the spirit It's a brand-new day It's a brand-new day And I'm feelin' good Feelin' good And I'm feelin' good - Yeah! - Yeah! Yes, all right. Mitchie Torres, returning rocker. Yes! Welcome to the heart and soul of rock 'n' roll. Whether you're slick and happening or dark and jamming, Camp Rock is the place to be, yeah? All right! Now, I'm sure you've noticed that there aren't quite as many of you as in years past. But not to worry. Shane! Sorry, she does that. Rockers, my nephews, and Camp Rock alum, better known to the world as Connect Three! Hey. We probably shouldn't have tied his shoes together. He's the one who said he could make anything look cool. And I believe he stands corrected. - Shane. Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Surprise. All right. They are gonna be with us for the entire summer. - The whole summer? - Absolutely. The official reason being they miss their uncle. But I don't think that's the entire story. People are staring. You might wanna do something, like react or wave. Hey, guys. I'm Shane. This is Jason and Nate. We know it's gonna be hard, but just treat us like normal campers. I guess it's not gonna be that hard. Yeah, as I was saying, we're a little smaller this year, and that is courtesy of our new friends across the lake, Camp Star, founded, not so coincidentally, by my out-to-destroy-me, still-mad-that-I-kicked-him out-of-the-group former bandmate, Axel Turner. Axel Turner? The guy who owns Star Records? He's across the lake? Yes, and I share your disdain, Tess. Thank you for that. Now, it's gonna take some effort, but I'm sure we can all peacefully co-exist on the lake, yeah? We're under attack! Nice. - It's full of marshmallows. - This one has chocolate. Graham crackers. Camp Rock's invited to an opening-night bonfire. No, no, no. Absolutely not. No. Bonfire, bonfire, bonfire! - This is a setup. For what I'm not sure. - Come on, Brown. lt'll be fun. You said yourself we all need to get along, right? And it's not just because I haven't made dessert yet. This is really good chocolate. Isn't it? One word: wow. - This isn't a camp, it's a resort. - You say that like it's a bad thing. All right, I got it. Oh, I don't got it. I think we should add this to the uncool list. A little help-- A little help, please. Thank you. See, these are the type of things that you can't learn over e-mail. Maybe we should go back to that. Guys, I'm not kidding. Line up and wait for me. Junior rockers, I'm serious. Please wait. Hey, what's up, guys? I remember when I used to be a junior rocker. - Is that a camera, bud? - Don't touch it. What, you think I'm gonna drop it in the water? And if you thought that, I guess you'd be right. - You dropped it, Curly. You swim for it. - Yeah. Brown, my man. Long time. - Hi, I'm Connie. - Hi. Listen, Axel, I don't actually know what your plan is-- A breath and a step. I'm beginning to remember why I left the band. Left the band. You left the band? That is so rich. Is that what you're telling people? You, my friend, have got to stop living in the past. I'm trying to reach out to you here. Reach out? Reach out by driving me out of business. I love it. There's no reason why we both can't be successful. - We both have our niche. - Niche? Camp Star is dedicated to producing the superstars of tomorrow. And what's your place about again? Encouraging kids in their love of music, Axel. Like I said, room for both of us. You know, just to be clear, he did not leave the band. We kicked him out. I know, I know. It's okay. We kicked him out. Question: What do you say you and I break away later and I finally take you on a first date? Answer: I'd like that. Check, check. One, two. Check, check. One, two. Check, check, check. I know, right? That's all I've been saying since I got off the boat. Come on. - Ready? - We really shouldn't be here. It's so obvious this guy's just doing this to get back at Brown. First, he tries to take down the White Crows, and now Camp Rock. What is that? Hot chocolate. They're handing it out free when you walk in, plus you get to keep the mug. What? There's no way I'm staying at this bonfire. Hey, pouty boy. You better hurry. The bonfire's about to start. You know, we should probably go take our seats. I think they're about to start. - Don't mock. - I'm not. - Yes, you are. - Okay, just a little bit. Look, they actually have a real Wardrobe Department with incredible fabric. And they let me make this. I think I just sewed my scarf to my bra. So I thought this was supposed to be a campfire. You know, singing, telling stories, an actual fire. Everybody have a seat. I'm Axel Turner. And I'd like to welcome all you rockers, and my dear, old friend, Brown Cesario-- Yeah, Brown! --to Camp Star! Go, Brown! But you all don't wanna hear a speech from me. You wanna get to what a campfire is really all about: Singing. Hey, that's what you just said. You're twins. So does anyone have anything they'd like to play? Camp Rockers, don't be shy. Well, we'll go, if nobody else wants to. This song is about me and a friend of mine. We're like a melody with no words Until we figure it out We sing, "la, la, la, la, la, la" I know it's simple, yeah But it's worked right up till now 'Cause up till now, yeah Every day's been like a dream world Oh, but now you're not just in my head Oh, no Will we remember different summers? It's like tossing your heart To see where it lands Heads is easy Tails is harder to plan If we're starting all over again And again and again Oh, you know that I can't help but wonder What's gonna happen next I'm a little curious Oh, yeah Every star that I stood under When you were under it too Did you ever think about us? I hope you did 'Cause I can tell you That's somethin' I'll never forget I won't forget If we remember different summers It's like tossing your heart To see where it lands Heads is easy Tails is harder to plan If we're starting all over again Only friends Just beginning But I hope that we find it again So we can go from here Oh Will we remember different summers? It's like tossing your heart To see where it lands Heads is easy Tails is harder to plan If we're starting all over again Again and again and again and again Again and again and again Will we remember different summers? That was sweet. But I guess it's time for Camp Star to answer. And my apologies if we embarrass ourselves. We're kind of new at this. Nobody's gonna wanna get next to me - 'Cause they know - They know I take what's mine and won't let it go Doesn't matter How you approach the scene - Just hope - Just hope You're everything and more When you hit the door I dare you to challenge me You'll be beggin' for mercy, please Just watch I'll give you somethin' to follow 'Cause I've been waitin' so patiently - To let the - Fire come out in me I'm what you're up against Just letting you know I keep giving you the fire I'm gonna heat it up under my control Here's the night that you've been waitin' on Fire I'm gonna light it up Gotta make it hot The stage is mine I'll set it on The king is gone And no one can take his crown So brave They can't cool me off When I hit the stage Burning hot The spotlight just spelled my name l feel famous The crowd cheers me on They can't get enough I dare you to challenge me You'll be beggin' for mercy, please Just watch I'll give you somethin' to follow 'Cause I've been waitin' so patiently Fire come out in me I'm what you're up against Just letting you know I keep giving you the fire I'm gonna heat it up under my control Here's the night That you've been waitin' on Fire I'm gonna light it up, gotta make it hot The stage is mine I'll set it on I keep giving you the fire I'm gonna heat it up under my control Here's the night That you've been waitin' on Fire I'm gonna light it up, gotta make it hot The stage is mine I'll set it on Fire Nate, are you okay? You guys rock! And that's how we do things here at Camp Star! Before we go any further, I'd like to make a quick announcement. We're having staffing problems. Who knew we'd be so popular? All right, now we're under attack. So I'd just like to put it out there. If there are any Camp Rock counselors or staff who'd like to make the switch, I'd be more than willing to double your salary. You've gotta be joking. I barely have enough staff as it is. - I'll go. - What? No. And, if there are any Camp Rock campers who'd like to join us, well, I'm sure we can find you a bunk. Oh, did I mention our cabins are air-conditioned? He can't do this. Right. I need all the Camp Rockers back on the boats now. Come on. - Go, please. - Come on, guys. Back to the boats. Let's go. Come on. Are you sure it's okay? Not a scratch. - I'm really sorry about that. - Oh, it's all good. I'm totally fine. I'm just happy I could catch it for you. Well, it's always kind of been my lucky charm. I guess it still works. Did you forget the part where you hit him in the eye? I'll be over there. So, Dana, you were amazing up there. You think? I'm just glad it's finally over. We've been practicing for weeks, and still, every time I go on, I'm almost sure I'm gonna throw up. I'm really glad you guys came. My dad was totally sure none of you would show. My dad's Axel Turner. He's your dad? Everybody says that, and kind of exactly like that, but trust me, once you get to know him, he's a really great guy. Well, I guess I should go. Here. You don't wanna lose it. You can keep it if you want. - What would I do with a bracelet? - Right. For the record, I'm glad you're okay. You have really pretty eyes. Sorry, that was weird. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. No, it's all good. People tell me that all the time. Probably because they're right in the middle of my face, so... So... What--? - I'll see you around. - Okay. Yes, I wanna keep it, you have pretty eyes too. Stupid. I'm an idiot. Something we both can agree on. Strong idiot. I... I don't want you talking to that boy. Don't worry, I don't think it's gonna be a problem. Okay, come on. Rockers, boats now. Now, this is a recording studio. Hey. Hi. Can I help you with something? Do I look like I need help? - Do I know you? - That's funny. I'm Luke. Luke Williams. I was just on-stage, like two minutes ago. I'm giving you the fire - Wow, impressive. - I know, right? It's kind of my thing. So you thinking about joining us over here? No, I'm perfectly happy where I am. Well, you are Shane Gray's girlfriend, so... Wait, what does Shane--? How do you even know that? You have to know the players if you wanna be in the game, right? - No. - It's a tough business. It's summer camp. To you, but to anybody at Camp Star, it's step one to a long and illustrious career. I don't have time for second rate. - We're not second rate. - You don't have to get all defensive. It's none of my business, you don't have to try to convince me. I'm not trying to do anything. Good. You're at the perfect place for you. Look, just so we're clear, Luke "I'm giving you the fire" Williams, or whatever your name is, not one Camp Rocker, not in a million years, would ever even think about coming over to this narcissistic, over-produced ego factory. Guess what. My mom said yes. I get to make the switch. That's great. Welcome to the ego factory. Thanks. Tess, how could you? Oh, I'm so sorry. I feel horrible, but... Who am I kidding? I am so excited, I can't even pretend to be sympathetic. That was great what you did up there. I'm giving you the fire - So impressive. - I know, right? Good luck trying to find a spotlight big enough for the both of you. No, you guys, it's gonna be okay. I mean, Brown's a smart guy, he can figure something out. Thanks for that vote of confidence, Mitchie. Guess I don't have to get everyone's attention. So the good news is, and this really warms my heart, we lost very few campers last night. That's right. But we did lose quite a few of our remaining staff. Which means, and I can't believe I have to say this, Camp Rock is closed, effective immediately. - Wait, what? - No. You have to believe me, I truly-- I've got no other option. I'll start calling parents as soon as we're done here, which I guess is now. I'm sorry. Brown, wait. Guys. Camp is over? But we just got here. It's not his fault. I mean, there's nothing he can do about it. Man, this is such a bummer. But... ...that doesn't mean there isn't something we can do about it. - What? - Mitchie. No, I'm serious. This is our summer and we're not giving up. - We're not backing down. - Right. I don't know, Mitchie. We can't, we can't back down Not right now, we can't back down We can't back down Oh, oh, yeah, yeah Don't close your eyes We're all in this together Wherever they draw the line We're not gonna straddle, we'll cross it Or lose it We can't back down There's too much at stake This is serious, don't walk away We can't pretend it's not happening In our own backyard Our own home plate - We've been called out - We've been called out - Do you hear your name? - Yeah I'm not confused Let's win this thing We can't back down There's too much at stake Don't walk away - Don't walk away - Don't walk away Yeah, yeah, yeah Don't get me wrong l don't like confrontation I'd rather we all just get along Music should be undivided United We can't back down There's too much at stake This is serious Don't walk away We can't pretend it's not happening In our own backyard Our own home plate - We've been called out - We've been called out - Do you hear your name? - Yeah I'm not confused, let's win this thing We can't back down There's too much at stake Don't walk away Don't walk away Don't walk away Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah We've got a situation That we can't ignore 'Cause ignorance is not bliss We don't have to take this, no With every big decision Comes an equally important Share of the risk - We've gotta take this, oh - We can't back down - There's too much at stake - Too much This is serious Don't walk away We can't pretend it's not happening In our own backyard Our own home plate We've been called out - Do you hear your name? - We've been called out I'm not confused, let's win this thing - We can't back down - We've been called out - There's too much at stake - We've been called out Don't walk away, don't walk away We can't back down We can't back down Not right now We can't back down What's going on? Well, you said you needed some new counselors, so I found you some. Then it looks like I should call this staff meeting to order. - Yes. - Thank you. - Yes. - All right. Come on, Terry. No, nada. Guys, I already told you, I'm not gonna be doing this. Jason, you're looking at this all wrong. This isn't punishment. It's a reward. - Really? - Really. This just means that everybody thinks that you have the leadership skills, the maturity, the intelligence-- - You think I'm intelligent? - No. --and the sheer guts to take on this challenge. - Wow, you're good. - Thank you. You're right. This is an honor. Exactly. Now, get in there and make us proud. We'll be right here if you need us. All right. - Run. - Run. Hi, everybody. I'm Jason. I'm gonna be your counselor. I'm a little new at this so I thought you guys would go a little bit easier on me. What do you say? I say, let's get him. - Yeah! - Guys, guys, hold on a minute. Now get him. No, no, no. All right, let's dance. Sorry. - All good? - All good. Let's do this. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Here we go, guys. All right. Circle, down. Head, meet, out. Louder. Awesome. We got a color that looks good with his eye color. What about this, girls? Right? Hi. Enough. Do you wanna rock? Well, you know what? You don't deserve to rock. Why should I show you the first thing about being a rock star, if you don't wanna show me any respect? Well, okay then. Who wants to play the drums? Who wants to play the guitar? Who wants to be a lead singer? Well, you are gonna have to buy tighter pants and learn how to play a tambourine. - I heard that. - Sorry. It's true. - Nate? - Yeah. Shane. What's up, bro? What are you doing? Lifeguard duty. Schedule's a mess, but you can't be too careful. Just one last look. All clear. So, what do I have to do to pull you away from this clipboard? Mitchie, I just rolled 100 pounds of raw hamburger all by myself. I told you, honey, I needed help. No, no, no, that's impossible. I know for a fact that I scheduled... - Absolutely nobody. I'm so sorry. - What's going on? This isn't working. The kitchen is a disaster. Yesterday, I ordered 50 pounds of black beans and they delivered 50 cases of beach balls instead. Well, you gotta admit, Mom, you don't have the best handwriting. Okay, it's rock 'n' roll, right? It's gonna be a little chaotic. I think you're doing great. We'll just make some adjustments to the schedule, yeah? Perfect. Shane, help Connie with the hamburgers. Actually, I've-- I've got this thing-- - Oh, really? Well, come on, pretty boy. - No, but-- All right, that's it. Now pick it up. Bring it home. I knew you could do it, All right, now it's getting a little late, so, what do you say we all go enjoy some free time? - Yeah. - All right. Hey, man. What are you doing? Why does everybody keep doing that? Sorry, we're just doing our part as activity directors. And what's the activity today? Wakeboarding. No! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great. Don't suppose you came over here to see anyone in particular. No, just getting some exercise. Do you play a lot of sports? Canoeing. That's pretty much it. I'm really not all that sporty either. I played soccer when I was little, but who doesn't? I don't know if it counts as a sport, but I'd kind of love to be a dancer. It's like my nerdy secret, "if I could be anything, that's what I'd be" wish. What would you be? I don't know. Never thought about it. Probably because if you could be anything, you'd be you. Do you wanna hear something really stupid? I was goofing around and I accidentally sort of wrote your name on my hand but used permanent ink by mistake. No one's ever written my name on their hand before. Really more my wrist. - Dana-- - Yeah? Dana? Oh, it's my dad. I'm so sorry, I'm not supposed to be talking to you. Hurry. Go. Dana? - Dana. - Hey. I saw this canoe. Don't touch it, it's one of theirs. I'll have an attendant fish it out. - What's that on your wrist? - Nothing. You wanna know what I wanna be? The kind of guy who can tell you how he really feels. I hate canoes. - I'm still an idiot. - I still agree. Dude, you can't keep hitting me. Thank you. Thanks, Mitchie. I had absolutely the best day ever. - Everything's finally starting to work out. - That's great. lt's all because of you. No, it's because of us. Now that everybody else has gotten your time, I think I'm gonna demand some of my own. It hasn't been that bad. The whole reason I'm here, the reason my brothers are here, is so I can get to know you better. It's only been like two seconds. And that is the sweetest thing that anybody has ever said to me. - But... - But-- And now a word from your friendly neighborhood announcer. Will the counselors scheduled for the bonfire please report to the mess hall? - But you gotta go. - But we gotta go. Are you coming? No, it's cool. I'll catch up. - Shane. - Go, they need you. Okay. Hey. I'm impressed. You seem to be doing much better with them. It took a little bit of time, but I think I finally gained their respect. Who glued me to this log? Log Butt, Log Butt! We're gonna call you Log Butt! You know what's worse than being called Log Butt? Is being sat on by Log Butt. Run. Run, he's got you. Come back here. Fireflies. - I'm gonna get this one. - Okay, catch them, everybody. Let's jump. Jump. Looks like the Lord of the Flies over there. There's no way they're gonna make it through the summer. I remember doing that. It's fun. Don't even think about it. It felt so great just standing up in front of that class today. I feel like there's nothing we can't do. Pleats. Still can't do pleats. Wish we had that attitude the other night at Camp Star. Yeah, I so wanted to show them up. That hardly counted. They'd been planning that for weeks. Yeah, and now they're all walking around thinking they're better than us. So not true. You know, I'd really like to see them go up against us. Yeah. If we had time to get it together, there's no way they'd stand a chance. Like in Final Jam. There's just no way. Lot of big talk. Wanna see if it's true? It's about time. My private vocal lessons started ten minutes ago. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that Axel thinks you need the extra rehearsal. Camp Rock. Yeah, that's right. We're here on your stage. See, you guys didn't really give us a chance to answer back the other night. But guess what. That's gonna change. Camp Rock vs. Camp Star, the Final Jam. What do you guys think about that? Drums. A little guitar, please. One, two, three, four I hope you're ready For the time of your life Just look at me I put a gleam in your eye Buckle up We're gonna take you for a ride Let's go We got you goin' good in the vibe - Everybody, put your hands to the sky - Hands to the sky Buckle up We're gonna take you, take you high Show me, show me, show me, show me Show what you got Come on, come on, come on, come on Ready or not La, la, la, la, la, la Let me see how you bop lt's on, it's on, it's on Get crazy, crazy, crazy Take it over the top 'Cause, because Because when we rock We let it rock Rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it Dance till we drop lt's on, it's on, it's on Okay, now - Are you ready? - Yeah One, two One, two, three, four Show stoppin' When I step in the place Before it's done You're gonna beg me to stay Get onboard Come on, let's ride the wave - Okay - Let's go, let's go, we just do what we do Watch me break and pop I'll pass it to you You wanna rock like us 'Cause we're never second place You ready, ready?

Truly. I'm impressed. A little healthy competition is exactly what we need. A champion always needs a good sparring partner. We do? But you really think that you can take my guys on head-to-head? - Any time, any place. - Yup. - Yeah. - Can't wait. Maybe use our amphitheater. Doesn't matter where. We just know that Camp Rock is gonna blow you guys away. - That's right. - Straight up. I'm sure an audience would be a better judge of that. Bring it on. You can pack it with anybody you want. Well, how about a worldwide audience? What if we put this little competition on TV? Have the public decide who's really the best. TV? We'd really get to be on TV? I don't really know about this. Not such a big talker now, are you? - But that would be so cool. - The whole world would see us. Come on, Mitchie. This could be huge. Yeah, let's do it. You're on. - All right. - Yeah. I wrote this song a long time ago and I kind of forgot about it, but I think it could work. It's a duet. Now. But I think I could rewrite it and make a part for everybody. Or we can rewrite it. "I lay pretty, pretty flowers on your grave." Am I the only one who thinks this song is, like, totally depressing? You're on the wrong page. Yeah, that song was for my hamster's funeral. Oh, this is perfect. The staging could be pretty cool. Yeah, it looks like there's some great spots for dancing. And it's got a great groove. Well, before we get ahead of ourselves, guys, I got a couple conditions. You've got conditions? Yes. Well, a condition. There has to be a spot for my junior rockers. Of course. That's what this is all about. So, what do you guys think? - I'm in. - Let's do it. I think somebody should talk to Uncle Brown. Why? I already know what he's gonna say. How could she do that? I told them. I told Mitchie Axel Turner cannot be trusted. I don't know why you're getting so upset. At the very least, Camp Rock could get some great exposure. He took advantage is what he did. He saw an opportunity and went for it. An opportunity to destroy me once and for all. And I thought Mitchie could be dramatic. Okay, then, just call him and say no. It's not that big a deal. Oh, we're well past big deal. Look. "Camp Wars." Catchy. Yeah, I especially like the tagline, "Only one will survive." Millions of viewers will be watching. That's good, right? After this, we are done. And not just for the summer, for good. Oh, come on. Brown. Give them a chance. Look, nobody believes in my rockers more than I do, but we are gonna look like a joke next to Camp Star. We don't have the resources, the infrastructure, the money. Talent, passion, commitment, yeah, we've got that. It's not gonna matter. It always matters. And when people watch, where do you think they're gonna send their kids to camp? - She didn't do it on purpose. - I know. I just wish she wouldn't have fallen into the trap. Good morning, Camp Rock. A message from Mitchie Torres: All rockers, please report to the main stage immediately. Yeah, that means you. Get moving. All right, rockers. There are new schedules out on the board. From this moment on, everything is about winning the competition. Everything. We have to be completely focused. What about swimming and waterskiing and--? Focus. Sorry. Sorry again. Seriously, you guys, if we wanna save this camp, we have to put all of our energies into this and make it the best performance that any of us have ever put on. I mean, we may have our doubters, but we have come way too far just to back down. Agreed? Agreed. All right. Now, let's go get to work. Now. I don't know what to do about this set, but it's just gotta be big. Think of the biggest thing you can imagine and then make it bigger. - All right. - Thanks. Mitchie, we're moving in the wrong direction. There's even less time on this than the last one. - I've got a few minutes now. - That's not what I mean. Mitchie, can you look at this? I want us to coordinate, but not be all matchy-matchy. - Mitchie-- Hi, Shane. - Hi. I know you're rewriting, but we've gotta make some decisions about the music. Mitchie, can I talk to you? Do you know who's doing the vocal arrangements? If it's me, fine, but somebody's gotta tell me. I'm sorry. I don't even know why I'm here. Take my advice and never get a girlfriend. I don't think that'll be a problem. Hey, what are you guys doing? I thought you were gonna be rehearsing. Whoa, calm down. We've been rehearsing for over five hours. We're just taking a little break. Really? Because I was watching, and it looks like we're gonna need a lot more work. - You guys done already? - No. He was just telling me this story about his sister. lt's hilarious. Tell her. The one about the group of kids that didn't take their jobs seriously and then the camp shut down? Yeah, I think I've heard it. Hey, Mitchie. You gotta check out this bit me and the J.R.'s worked out. It's a real spotlight moment. That's great. I'm sure whatever it is, it's just gonna have to be more of a background moment. Sander, what's going on? You guys haven't made any progress since I left like half an hour ago. You guys have to get this thing built. You guys have to work with me. If I wanted to go to Camp Star I would have signed up. Okay, that's not fair. I'm just trying to get stuff done, but if you guys don't care-- Mitchie. We all care, but you gotta lighten up. Really? And what will that get us? All right, okay. Let's do it again. That girl is taking the F-U-N out of summer. There is no F-U-N in "summer." - Exactly. - Seriously, I love her, but I'm gonna kill her. Okay, I think you know what you've gotta do. I'm on it. Guys, guys, calm down. She didn't say no, she said she'd think about it. All work and no spray makes a very unhappy rocker. So I got a proposition for you guys. You think you're up for it? Okay, we have a ton of stuff to go over. Where is everybody? Seriously, people have got to start being on time. Attack! Oh, this was not on the schedule. Are you kidding? This is what summer camp is all about. Counterattack! Come on! Come on, then. - I know. - It's so high. - Look at that. - That's a lot of fire there. - So fun today. - Today was so awesome. - Yeah. - Has anybody seen Mitchie? I don't know. She missed dinner. Okay, thanks. Look at our fire. Your sheet music's soggy. Just pouring myself into my music. - That was bad. - Yeah, I know. - Are you here to help? - I can't. Why? Because you and I are going on a moonlight picnic. - Now? - Right now. - How could you-- - Because I'm that nice of a guy. --think that I would just go running off? Are you saying no? Do you not understand everything that needs to get done? How could I not? You remind me every two seconds. And the water-balloon fight. I mean, what were you thinking? I was thinking, "Wouldn't it be nice to have a little fun?" So you're saying I'm not fun? Why do I even keep trying? The whole reason I came was because-- I know. It was to get to know me better. Well, guess what. This is me trying to save something that I care about. - So am I. - Really? How's that working out for you? Not so great. Shane. You forgot your flashlight. It's like he doesn't hear a word I say His mind is somewhere far away And I don't know how to get there - lt's like all he wants is to chill out - She's way too serious - He makes me wanna pull all my hair out - She's always in a rush and interrupting - Like he doesn't even care - Like she doesn't even care - You - Me We're face to face - But we don't see eye to eye - But we don't see eye to eye - Like fire and rain - Like fire and rain - You can drive me insane - You can drive me insane - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - We're Venus and Mars - We're Venus and Mars - We're like different stars - Like different stars But you're the harmony To every song I sing - And I wouldn't change a thing - And I wouldn't change a thing She's always tryin' to save the day Just wanna let my music play She's all or nothing But my feelings never change - Why does he try to read my mind? - I try to read her mind - lt's not good to psychoanalyze - She tries to pick a fight to get attention - lt's what all of my friends say - lt's what all of my friends say - You - Me We're face to face But we don't see eye to eye - Like fire and rain - Like fire and rain - You can drive me insane - You can drive me insane - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - We're Venus and Mars - We're Venus and Mars - We're like different stars - Like different stars You're the harmony To every song I sing - And I wouldn't change a thing - And I wouldn't change a thing When I'm yes, she's no When I hold on he just lets go - We're perfectly imperfect - We're perfectly imperfect - But I wouldn't change a thing, no - But I wouldn't change a thing, no - We're like fire and rain - Like fire and rain - You can drive me insane - You can drive me insane - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - We're Venus and Mars - We're Venus and Mars - We're like different stars - Like different stars But you're the harmony To every song I sing - And I wouldn't change a thing - And I wouldn't change a thing - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - But I can't stay mad at you for anything - We're Venus and Mars - We're Venus and Mars - We're like different stars - Like different stars But you're the harmony To every song I sing - And I wouldn't change a - And I wouldn't change a - Wouldn't change a thing - Wouldn't change a thing Where is everybody? All right, now let's look at the alto harmony on measure 15. There's a four-bar rest. - Good morning. - Morning. - Hold on. - What's going on? You were right. It shouldn't be all up to you. And we do need to step it up. Shane got everybody up before dawn. He can be pretty persuasive when he wants to be. Morning. Sleep well? I don't think you got the new arrangement yet. Needed a lot of work. You did this? - We all did. - Yeah. I already know I'm gonna love it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. All right, let's get started. We gotta rock this stage like we own it, right? Now, I can hear you, but I gotta see you play. - Nate, show them how it's done. - Like this. Excellent. Jason, show them how to rock. Okay, guys, not like this: But like this: Good job. Well, it's easy for you guys, but we're not all rock stars. But you can be. Yeah All right Gather round, guys It's time to start listenin' Practice makes perfect But perfect's not workin' There's a lot more to music Than knowing where your cue's gonna be You can play all the right notes But that don't mean you're movin' me But if you can jump like David Lee Roth Or pump your fist Like you're Bruce the Boss If you got heart and soul You can rock 'n' roll Rock 'n' roll Strum it, drum it Slide across and run it The stage is your home If you learn how to own it Like the greats did There's no way that you can fake it You've gotta feel the beat Before you can move Even though you're not wearin' Blue suede shoes And makin' mistakes Well, that won't matter If you can swagger Like you're Mick Jagger If you've got heart and soul You can rock 'n' roll Solo If you live and die for the music inside If the one-four-five never gets old Then you can rock 'n' roll Rock 'n' roll All right, now, take it low Now, I need the spotlight To hit me right here As the crowd starts to cheer l need the fan to blow Right through my rock-star hair Right here If you can scream like Axl Rose Or sing like Christina show after show If you've got heart and soul - You can rock 'n' roll - Yeah If you've got heart and soul You can rock 'n' roll Yeah You can rock 'n' roll Hi, Nate. Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Hi, Dana. - What are you doing here? - What do you think? - You came to see me? - Good guess. Well, here I am. That's it? I came all the way over here in a canoe risking my father's wrath, and that's all you have to say to me? I don't know what else I'm supposed to say. There's nothing you're supposed to say. Every day I see you looking and waving and I'm all, "That's so sweet. I so like him." You do? Really, that's what you say? - But then-- - "But then"? That's never good. How do I really know if I don't know anything about you? - I guess I just thought you were different. - I am different. No, you're not. You're exactly like every other teenage boy in the world. Have you ever told me anything about yourself? You know, other than you like canoeing. Well, I don't really like canoeing. Oh, good. So I really know nothing about you. I still don't know what I'm supposed to say. I think you just did. Idiot. Special order. I take back what I said about girlfriends. It's all good, because at this rate, I'll never have one. What do you mean? - Well, there's this girl. - I kind of figured. I really like her, but I'm having a hard time telling her how I really feel. You're a rock star, dude. Use it. I don't think she cares. She just wants to know all this stupid, random stuff about me. It's not random stuff. She just wants to know you care enough to let her know who you are. Well, I care. But I just don't know how to say it. Well, if you can't say it, you can sing it. Every single time I'm trying to sing my high note, I keep getting lost behind her big head. - Oh, no, you didn't. - You couldn't stand the spotlight. Now that you mention, I'm not trying to do anything. Enough. We'll run it again in three minutes. And this time, remember, it's not amateur hour. He means you. Hi, Dana. Kind of makes you jump, doesn't it? - You shouldn't be here. - I know, but I couldn't wait. Wait for what? It's a list of things that nobody knows about me. Two minutes. I really gotta go. I'm sorry. Wait. We still have two minutes. Okay. I'm, I'm good at wasting time I think lyrics need to rhyme And you're not askin' But I'm tryin' to grow a mustache I eat cheese But only on pizza, please And sometimes On a homemade quesadilla Otherwise it smells like feet to me And I, I really like it When the moon looks like a toenail And I love it when you say my name Places, everybody. Come on. If you wanna know, here it goes Gonna tell you there's a part of me That shows if we're close Gonna let you see everything But remember that you asked for it I'll try to do my best to impress But it's easier to let you take a guess At the rest But you wanna hear What lives in my brain and my heart Well, you asked for it For your perusing, at times confusing Slightly amusing Introducing me Come on, get a move on. We don't have all day. I never trust a dog to watch my food And I like to use the word "dude" As a noun or an adverb or an adjective And I, I never really been into cars I like really cool guitars And superheroes And checks with lots of zeros on them l love the sound of violins And makin' someone smile If you wanna know, here it goes Gonna tell you there's a part of me To show if we're close Gonna let you see everything But remember that you asked for it I'll try to do my best to impress But it's easier to let you take a guess At the rest But you wanna hear What lives in my brain and my heart Well, you asked for it For your perusing, at times confusing Possibly amusing Introducing me Well, you probably know More than you ever wanted to So be careful when you ask next time Dana. So if you wanna know, here it goes Gonna tell you There's a part of me to show if we're close Gonna let you see everything But remember that you asked for it I'll try to do my best to impress But it's easier to let you take a guess At the rest But you wanna hear What lives in my brain and my heart Well, you asked for it For your perusing, at times confusing Hopefully amusing Introducing me Dana. Everyone's waiting. Sorry. lt's my fault. Why don't you save the theatrics for the competition? It's okay. Go. Thank you. We'll talk about this later. And all that was left was a bloody footprint. - Lame. - Not even scary. Yeah, totally not scary at all. Okay, time for bed. Turn on the lights. - But you called "lights out." - I know what I called. What was that? Jason, do you think we're gonna win? - Yeah, Jason. - Yeah, do you think we're gonna win? Of course we're gonna win. You guys are rock stars. But what if they are too? I guess I really didn't think about that. Good night. Everybody up. Follow my lead. We're on a mission. Okay, guys, stay low. Roll. Oh, a rock. Okay. Don't roll. Okay, gently, guys. Come on, carefully. Single file. Slow. Careful. Guys, come on. Go, go. You can play a song Almost any groove We can break it down Break it down Hey You can play a song When you see me move Make you turn around Turn around I know you Checkin' on me I should be checkin' on you Give me the green light I'm ready to go Here at the start line I'm breaking the rope - I'm gonna take you - I'm gonna shake you - No one's gonna lose - Walkin' in my shoes Won't stop at the red light I'm on a roll Turn up the music I'm out of control I'm gonna take you - No one's gonna lose - Walkin' in my shoes When the lights come on You can feel the heat Then I'll hit the floor, hit the floor When the curtain's up I fly on my feet You'll be wantin' more Wantin' more I know you Checkin' on me I should be checkin' on you Give me the green light I'm ready to go Here at the start line I'm breaking the rope - I'm gonna take you - I'm gonna shake you - No one's gonna lose - Walkin' in my shoes Won't stop at the red light I'm on a roll Turn up the music I'm out of control - I'm gonna take you - I'm gonna shake you - No one's gonna lose - Walkin' in my shoes - Walkin' in my shoes - Yeah Walkin' in my shoes - Give me the green light - I'm ready to go No one's gonna lose Walkin' in my shoes Give me the green light I'm ready to go Here at the start line I'm breaking the rope - I'm gonna take you - I'm gonna shake you - No one's gonna lose - Walkin' in my shoes Won't stop at the red light I'm on a roll Turn up the music I'm out of control - I'm gonna take you - I'm gonna shake you - No one's gonna lose - Walkin' in my shoes Go, go, go. Walkin' in my shoes Hey - Well? - Good. Maybe great. But this competition isn't about maybe. Okay, fine. But can you tell her to stay out of my light? Well, maybe if you would stay out of my way, it wouldn't be a problem. Let me see "Tear it Down" instead. Let's reset, people. Come on. Move! This has to be perfect. Camp Rock isn't gonna know what hit them. - And the stage was, like, super-cool. - It's huge. Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Wait, so it's just Tess and Luke singing? Yeah, pretty much. Everybody else is doing something, but they're definitely the stars. But this makes it so much easier. We could totally win this thing. - How so? - Oh, come on. Even I get it. I don't care what they're singing, but you and Shane are better than Tess and Luke any day. But Shane and l aren't even singing together. But you originally wrote the song as a duet. - I know, but l-- - You're our two strongest singers. And we know you have chemistry. It's just, everybody worked so hard. Yeah, to help save the camp. If the two of you singing alone on-stage can help us win, you have to do it. Then it's settled. Remember when Audrey jumped on Jason? Man, the shaving cream was the best one. You guys okay with just Shane and I singing? Yeah, we're good. I was just looking forward to doing some of my new moves. But it's okay, if it means we get to come back here next summer. - You guys had a good summer? - Only the best summer ever. You guys just gave me the best idea ever. Thank you. Hey, guys, new plan. Everyone meet in ten minutes. Hello, and welcome to Hitz TV. I'm Georgina Farlow. And today we're bringing you Camp Wars, the ultimate summer-camp showdown. Now, there can be only one winner this Final Jam, and your votes are gonna help us decide. Just call or text in after each performance-- Kids, make sure to have your parents' permission. --and let us know who you think sang out and who you think hit a wrong note. What's your favorite camp, Camp Star or Camp Rock? - And we're out. - Okay. Georgina. - It's great to see you. - As always, Axel. Well, I'm gonna go backstage and do some stand-ups before the concert. - Good luck. - Thank you. All right, let's go get some interviews backstage with some of the campers. - You know her? - No, I know everyone. But don't worry, she doesn't have anything to do with the voting. So I probably shouldn't hold out hope for us ever being friends again? Probably not. Though you never know, next year I might hire you to run my summer camp. Thanks. But I'm already booked. Good luck. I'll be lucky if you don't forget your words this time. By "good luck" I mean "I hope you fall off the stage." As the sun goes down, the volume goes up. Welcome back to the ultimate summer-camp showdown, where you decide the winner. Now, first up is Camp Star. Now, Camp Star was founded only this year by superstar producer and founder of Star Records, Axel Turner, who's been producing for over 20 years. Now, I know if I was gonna study music, this is the place I'd wanna be. - Why is she saying that? - It's her job. She's supposed to say nice things. If she doesn't stop talking, I think I'm gonna throw up. Too late. Well, there's no turning back now, because the party has already started. Camp Star, everybody. Tear it down Yo, Luke, I need you to do something for me. I was ready for this Since I was cradlin' Put my name on the list You won't be gamblin' Not gonna leave with just this We takin' everything Confidence, compliments I bet you see it's evident Catch me if you can I'm like a bandit I can float on my feet You can't stand it I don't just dance in a group I command it We'll give you more than You want and you can handle When we're out on the floor We'll take over the ball Stealin' the show We're gonna leave you in awe When we're comin' up When we're comin' up We gonna tear it down You can't stop us now You can't shut us down You can't top the sound Better get ready now We're gonna tear it down The looks, we got 'em The moves, we got 'em The style, we got it We gonna tear it down The love, we got it The crowd, we own it Tonight, we run it We gonna tear it down - We gonna tear it down - Yes, yes, yes Them no want to contest we Recognize we the best that can be Sing, dance and rap Get hands to clap Of course you know that You can't hold a candle to our flames Tear it up and we takin' names It's not a game, it's a shame You can't be like us Can't be like us We leave you in the dust Of course we tear it up When we're out on the floor We'll take over the ball Stealin' the show We're gonna leave you in awe When we're comin' up When we're comin' up We gonna tear it down You can't stop us now You can't shut us down You can't top the sound Better get ready now We gonna tear it down The looks, we got 'em The moves, we got 'em The style, we got it We gonna tear it down The love, we got it The crowd, we own it Tonight, we run it We gonna tear it down Camp Star, everyone. Remember, if you loved them as much as I did, call or text in now. But don't go anywhere, because in a moment we're gonna hear from Camp Rock. - What happened to you? - When I get nervous I sparkle things. - Would you stop and listen? - You sounded good too. - Hey, you guys were incredible. - I know, right? Only one thing would've made it better: doing it solo. I totally agree. It's this bantery thing that we-- Thanks. Good luck. Quite a performance, eh? No denying it. But don't count those votes just yet, love. - I think you're gonna be very impressed. - I don't need to be impressed. - It'd be a miracle if Axel didn't win. - Excuse me? You know how much money he spent marketing this? He's paying to text and tweet every cell phone user in the western hemisphere. You don't even need to see the show to know to vote for Camp Star. One minute. How come I just got a text telling me to vote for Camp Star? I just got one too. It's asking me if I wanna download Camp Star's song as my ringtone. You were really a star. Thanks. And I really gotta go. Oh, I hate crust on my bread, and birds make me nervous. Excuse me. Oh, that performance was amazing. Thank you. - Don't you have somewhere to be? - Yes, but, you know, once you start expressing your innermost thoughts and feelings, it's kind of hard to stop. - Wish us luck. - Good luck. Dana, he is the enemy. No, he's not. Not everything in life is a competition. But I think I just won. And we're back. If you liked Camp Star, get ready to be blown away by Camp Rock. Now, Camp Rock was founded by rock icon and legendary lead guitarist Brown Cesario. - You ready? - Let's do this. Ladies and gentlemen, Camp Rock. They say that life is a two-way street When you're not sure You gotta trust your feet To know the right way You can keep on moving With your head down - Or you can stop and take a look around - Take a look around - And that's the choice I've made - I've made, yeah - lt's for that movie inside your head - lt's for that movie inside your head - Making memories we can't forget - Making memories we can't forget And when you can't forget You're gonna know In your soul This is what we came here for - So live it loud - Here and now This moment, it won't be ignored So why not open up that door? lt's what we came here for Oh, yeah For every song we let play outside The melodies we get to ride - We get to ride - Every time we sing Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah The friends we've made The fun we've had Remembering's gonna make me laugh - lt's a beautiful thing - So beautiful - I wanna send it around the world - I wanna send it around the world All around the world 'Cause everybody should feel this good 'Cause when you feel this good You're gonna know In your soul This is what we came here for Oh, so live it loud Here and now This moment, it won't be ignored You're gonna know In your soul This is what we came here for - So live loud - Live loud Here and now This moment, it won't be ignored It won't be ignored - So why not open up that door? - Open up that door So come on, open up that door It's what we came here Surprise! - Oh, yeah - Came here For It's what we came here Came here for Weren't they incredible? So call in now, and tell us which summer camp rules. And don't go anywhere. We'll be right back. Call in, call in. Yes. Impressive, but it'll never sell. You know, it should still be about the music. Maybe so, but that's why you'll never make it in this business. That's fine. I don't wanna be in your business. And the results are in. You know, I was thinking about keeping this as a souvenir. Can't believe we lost. Every song can't be a hit. Isn't that what you told me? Doesn't mean we have to stop singing. I'm really sorry I didn't spend more time with you this summer. - Hey, the whole reason I came here-- - Was to get to know me better. And I've learned everything I need to know. So let's sing Na, na-na-na, na Hey, ya Come on and sing Na, na-na-na, na Hey, ya This is our song That's all that matters 'Cause we all belong Right here together There's nothin' better Than singin' along This is our summer This is our song Come grab your guitar Sit by the fire 'Cause we all need a song When we're weary and tired We'll sit here together - And sing it out loud - And sing it out loud This is our song That's all that matters 'Cause we all belong Right here together There's nothin' better Than singin' along This is our summer And this is our song This is our song What's that? - Hi, we saw the fire. - We really don't get to do this kind of thing. So we were hoping there was room for some of us to join. There's always room. If it's okay with you, I'd really like to come back to Camp Rock next summer. Come on.
