THE GIRL AND THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER 07...01...50. 07...02. Good morning. 07...03. Wakey wakey! Come on, Bastian. Otherwise they'll steal your photo-op. Who'd steal my photo-op? He's due to land at the airport. Did you think I'd forgotten? I'm there already. Shouldn't you wear a tie? Is it really necessary? - Here. - Don't bother. Tell me, just how did you get in? Just get ready. Don't start pushing me around. That's not the way things need be done. Fantastic. Four studio apartments available for rent. - No key-money?! - Where? Show me! There he is! Yet interview! Nyet photograph! No way, Soren. Can't get through. What are you on about? I'm catching a plane to Malmo. Well in that case, go through there. I'm not going to Malmo. Not today. What a time to get here! Bastian slept in as usual? We're stymied. He's still on the plane. No access? No interviews. No photos. So no one else got anything either? No, but we'll be able to. - How so? - I've worked it out. You go and distract the boys... You're good at that. Follow me... Hurry up! It's a classic. Hi guys...! Have you seen Bastian? He hasn't come yet, funnily enough. Soren was just here, on his way to Malmo. Camera. How do you take them? Smile. Cheese. Something special going on? Surely you know who's sitting in that plane? I wouldn't have a clue. Got a knock-back, eh? Hi... this man's from the embassy. He has a delivery for you kow who. You can't come through while the plane's there. - What can we do? - You'll have to see the security chief. I've explained to him. He was excited about that. - He says you should know him. - Do you know him? - That's for sure. - We can ring the chief. By the time you find him, the bird will have flown... peace broken down and war declared. You have to follow your instincts. Great... thanks! Impossible to interview him? Impossible. The Iron Curtain's down. Hey, look! I feel ill! I feel ill... help me! Delivery from the ambassador to the honored guest. If you doubt the contents, You can open it yourself, Sir. Magazine? There you are. My pleasure. - A brandy, quick! - Yes, that would be nice. A vodka? There's still a bottle of the strong stuff left. What do you mean? Does that guy rate more money? I was just wondering. You're pretty good! Look at this, Lena. What do you think? Can they be this week's married couple? [Kennedy and Kruschev] Yeah, Gormsen QC and wife... That's for sure. Is he the one who owns the building I live in? No doubt. Well, he can get me an apartment. Are you sick of your single room? Get a move on! Take it easy, my in-tray's full. "Dear LetterBox, My name's Karen and I'm happily married..." "but now my husband has started calling me Lisbeth." "He gets mad if I correct him." "It's easier for him to call me Lisbeth. Shall I correct him?" How do I answer that? "Buy a new hat." Now get out of here! that was a good answer. It's not something to joke about. Yes my darling, of course. I'll be home as soon as possible. As soon as I've finished work. Of course, dear. You're my one and only, darling. Get ready... The family's gathered. It must be wonderful, being married. Imagine... after years marriage, you still talk like that to your wife! - What if my wife weren't jealous? - She's no reason to be. How about put your arm around her and give her a little kiss? What's the meaning of this? The first picture in the series "This Week's Married Couple" is ready. - Who said you could photograph here? - Your wife. Have you spoken with my wife? We're photographing in your home as well. This young lady is not my wife. Shame. It was a nice photo. You looked so natural. I don't understand any of this. You're not to take photographs! You had such a lively expression. I'm sure you'll be pleased. It will put me in good stead with you.. Really? It's just a single room in one of your properties. So that's... I'm happy with it, but it's a little tight around the hips. So you're not his wife? You've misunderstood the situation. No misunderstanding. Beautiful young lady, with the boss bending over her. Sounds of kissing, through the door. You thought that was me?! That was him kissing his wife, over the telephone. You sound very convincing. He's in love with his wife. How'd you like to be a photo model? You're wasting your time. Cover pics are waiting. We could discuss it tonight, with some live music. It's a nice room. Quiet! Do me a favour... It doesn't need to be a big apartment. So long as I get peace and quiet and sleep. I have a very stressful job. You're not giving me an apartment?. No, I'm not giving you an apartment. You'll give me an apartment. It's not my problem. I won't do it! You'll not get an apartment in any of my properties! Get what you needed to? Yes, but no apartment. See you tonight. Where are you meeting him tonight? - I don't trust you. - Why not? Asking a girl out, the first time you saw her. Can I trust a girl who says yes first time ? Yes. Otherwise she'll ever know if she can trust the man. - When's the photographer coming? - Any minute now. I'll want to see him before I believe you. - He's coming. - I want to be photographed. You'll be shot from every angle. I want to see the pictures in "Look and Listen". And when you've seen the pictures... I still won't trust you. Only one kind of man is faithful. What sort? A Doberman. Oh, good evening! Good evening. Excuse me, but... Do you go out at night without your wife? Is that you? I have to talk to you in private. That won't be so easy. I'm not leaving my entree. We can dance. It's easy to talk when you're dancing. Excuse us. Her...the lawyer's secretary. She's dancing with my landlord. He won't want to be photographed. SHE is the one to photograph. Okay. Those pictures taken in the office... - What about them? - Photos can be misinterpreted. If my wife was to see them. Will you stop that! Get down from there! Enough! I won't be photographed! - Yes, you told me before. - The pictures will be confiscated. I asked him to take the photos. Calm down, they aren't of you. Come over to the bar, and I'll explain. Well... what do you think of Soren Kierkegaard? Just great. I haven't got through all his work yet. Sorry? I first started reading him when I read about existentialism. That...? Yeah. Kierkegaard is the key to all that Sartre wrote. So he's the one who has the key? Thank heavens for that. How about a drink? We're not interested in you at all. So why were you shooting in my office? Then, it WAS you we wanted to photograph. There he is again! Surely not photographing in the bar? Just calm down. My wife thinks I'm playing bridge. Cheers! Bastian! I'll get a picture of you. No thanks, no more pictures. Frankly, you're a bit slow on the uptake. We can blacken things in photos. Yes, blacken my good name and reputation. You won't succeed. I repeat... we'll blacken you out. It's the girl that we want. My secretary is not going to be used for extortion. I deliver the pictures to you first, after I've assessed the girl. And that's just because of the balance of power between China and the Soviet Union, that Mao has divisions at the ready. Speaking of division, I firmly believe that Ikast is pulling out of another division... if 93 takes two points from Viborg. Ikast is in the 3rd division. They've no chance against Rodovre. If it doesn't rain. Ikast has always done best on a wet ground. One has to try to keep up with culture a bit. - What's your surname? - Solomonson. Solomonson... of course. You study in your free time? Yes, marine biology. I want to be a marine biologist when I grow up. - I could almost believe it. - Could you really? I'm already in deep water. . Shall we dive in together? Good morning! Bastian! It is lethargic in the dark and can live to 105 years old. It is 37 cm long, has an orange-yellow ringed back bears live children and eats the male in thanks. Did you know that? You've been getting out of your depth. Yes, with a marine biologist. Talented girl. But hampered by her looks. She's ugly? Beautiful. Stylish. 95-62-95. Have you already got her number? They're her vital statistics. Are you seeing her again? Soren thinks she'll be a model. I'll take the pictures. Soren thinks he'll be there. - But he's not going to be. - Get a move on! The lawyer's place. Our couple of the week. - Is the queue there already? - Yes. If we're offered sherry, I'll flip my lid. Goodness! Are they here already?! Everything ready, Anna? Well, open it, Anna! Hello. Did you injure your head? - They're here. - Who, Anna? We're here about the article in "Look and Listen". Goodness, was that today? Smile! - Bastian. - Did you take it? Sorry, it's a bit messy in here. Well you should see MY place! This will be quick and painless. Take all the time you need. - Can I offer you a sherry? - Thank you, yes. I'd love a sherry! She doesn't like it either. - There we are. - Thanks so much. - Welcome!. - Thanks. Cheers! I think we'll take some pictures first. Right, Bastian? We might as well start. We'll take a portrait on the.. COUGH... stairs. That was a funny expression. Axel? Axel, dear...? ...This is about YOU! Goodness! I'm sorry! Quite OK. No harm done. - That's good! - Like this? It'll be unique. Hold this? Down here. Hold it. Goodness! Did you take it? Is that you? I don't want to take him. I photographed him yesterday with the deep-sea-wannabe. Were you photographed with a deep-sea...? I was elected to the board of the Centre for Marine Biological Research. That's why I was late home. You said you were to play bridge. You must have misunderstood. You're acting very strangely. May we continue? What does the photographer have to say? I haven't said anything, yet. Let's get down to business. You want an apartment. I can get you a beautiful apartment, but it has to be new. Come and I'll show you. What's Axel on about? Something about marine biology. Excuse me. The Hansens live above. They have a lot of kids. New buildings are always noisy. Carpets will help. Carpets up there? Jensen lives next door. He has a scratchy nib on his pen. What's the rent? It's reasonable. Petersen's cat jumped off the sofa. Reasonable rent. 985 Kr a month, plus GST. That's harder to explain. But Mrs Olsen knits a lot... ...so she may have dropped a stitch. What was the rent? 985 a month plus heating. And just a 12,000 bond. We have to get back to your wife. And discuss the photography. I do have another apartment which could suit you. An older, modernised property, at a very reasonable rental. - I think we should see it. - Yes, why not. Or maybe she's eating soup. Please come in. This is very different. The renovators are still working, but everything will be well-finished - Where's the bedroom? - Here. This could be very nice. Not very big. That doesn't matter... it's very nice. What's the rent? We can talk about that. Do you have children? Excuse me? Do you have children? No, he doesn't have children, but he likes children. Actually, it can only be rented to a married couple with at least one child. - How long have you been married? - Married? My husband's just testing the acoustics. We'll take the apartment. I'll have to tell the Housing Board that there's a child on the way. Yes, do that. Come to the office and sign the contract. My husband will come later. But I'm not... We'll stay and decide on the furniture arrangement. See you soon then. Now that I've found you an apartment, can you do me a favour? The pictures you took yesterday... Can I have them? Absolutely not. They're awful. Both of you and Yvette. I won't show them to anyone. So we'll see you in my office in the morning. - Did I really get the apartment? - Yes. What curtains shall we have? Did he believe we were married? Crazy. The idea is insane. Think so? Absolutely! We have to do it. We'll have to show a marriage certificate. Would you go through a marriage, just so I could get an apartment?! So long as I can furnish it. Lena... You're nice. You're a friend. Do you know what I do? I'll shout you dinner. We'll find a hot-dog stand. Yvette, nothing happened about yesterday. How about dinner, later? There'll be no photographer. I almost thought it was a joke. He's just been here. The photos weren't any good. No, not before I've been photographed and appear in "Look and Listen". Anybody home? - We're getting married. - Who? We shall. But only on paper. So I can get an apartment. One does anything for a friend in need. He's not much to be friends with. Why did you tell Hot Stuff that her photos were no good? What's it to her? I want to get a date with her, that's all! She's a darkroom fraud. No she's not! I saw her first. But I'll photograph her. I decide who'll be there. - No way! Right, Lena? - I agree. Take a good picture of her. Yes, when I've moved in. Will you photograph her there? Now that I've got myself together, I have to make use of the apartment. Hello. See the lady in there with the light hair? I'll go and sit down. In 5 minutes, you come and tell me I have a phone call. The lady mustn't know that it's not. - So you understand? - Understood.. Would you take this for me? Don't bother yelling at me. Everyone's been bugging me today. Shall we have little drink while we're waiting? Waiting for what? To be served. Hey, waiter... Could we have something while we're waiting... - A dry martini, thanks. - And a whiskey on the rocks. But with ice. Are you in a hurry? Not at all. Feeling guilty? - About what? - For being late. For that? No! You act like you're married. Married men are strange with me. Married? Me, married? Don't be ridiculous! Absolutely not. - Phone call for you. - Thanks. A phone call for me. Of course... What else would it be? Of course. Probably the paper. Rush job. That's the press for you. Doctors and press photographers. You can photograph yourself while I'm gone. I'll just set the focus... The release cable's attached. So I just...? There are 36 pictures. I'll be back within 20 minutes. Here you are. As thanks for your friendship and for doing this for me. - Can I open it? - Why not? An antique for your car. - Are they for me? - It's my bridal bouquet. - How much were they? -15 kronor. Thanks. We're in the wrong seat. You have turned to the authorities to have your marriage ratified... Isn't he done yet? ...it reminds me on the importance of that connection... I'm in a hurry. A girl is waiting for me. ...as it is for married couples... Love, fellowship and honour... ...the authorities tell you in the name of the state... ...all the rights that come with a legal marriage. But also impose on you all the obligations... that married couples have for each other to each other and to others. ...and the fulfillment of... It was real cool of you. Thanks. See you. Give them to me. She'll be furious. Flowers always help a little. So this is where I live. Looks like a real apartment. What did you expect? A poky little one-roomer? Have a look around. What a dream-kitchen. Everything where it should be. Wait till you see the living-room. I never would've believed you lived like this. It's all so nice and tidy. That's the way I like things to be. This is where I want to be photographed. Better idea... the four-poster bed. I have a four-poster bed! No way! No four-poster for me. I want to be a marine biologist. The connection could hilarious... You in a bathing costume at the Denmark Aquarium. I want the photos to be serious! It's to get money for my studies. You in the four-poster in a neglige, holding a big thick book. "Studying marine biology in seventh heaven." In bed. Bed... But I have to be dressed. Any sacrifice for my career! Good evening. Good evening. - I'm Yvette. - Lena. Who are you? Only his wife. You said you weren't married! I wasn't, at that point in time. We were married at the town hall this afternoon. But she isn't my bride, a such. Sure, we were married, but.... Anyway, what are you doing in my bed? Embroidering an advent calendar. Beside the point! Could you explain to Yvette that... That you gave her my bridal bouquet? Thanks. Bastian... Come here. It's not going to work for you. I'd get a divorce right away. You've all the rights on your side. I work in a lawyer's office. You'll get the apartment and alimony. Have me called as a witness... I'll back you all the way. Good night. Sorry to have bothered you. I thought you were a friend. A real pal ! Here are your pajamas. Good night. Shut the door on your way out. Bastian? Bastian? Boohoo! Time to get up! The bathroom's free. That never happened before. Where's my towel? - Where am I? - Home, at your place. Home, at my place? That's nice. When shall we divorce? It'll have to go on for a while, to look credible. What do you mean by "a while"? I have to consider my parents. You have parents? Yes. My father's colonel in Jutland. Colonel? They won't be happy with a quickie divorce. We were only married on paper. So we can divorce, can't we? What's the rush? Are you getting married again? Hardly. Not with the marine biologist? You've spoiled any chance I had. I did?! - Ring and tell her she misunderstood. - No way! It make no difference to YOU. It was your fault. That was nice. - What are you doing? - Getting dressed. - Are there any jobs today? - Not yet. We should have been at 'Odd Fellow' for the final rehearsal, but Soren cancelled it. Why's that? Why? Because Sir Thomas won't allow press photographers. So I'd be the only one. You don't get in, either. There could be some great shots, with him conducting. When is it? In 45 minutes. Bellini will be there too. Bellini. Bellini... So I know how we'll do it. I'll tell you in the car. Is the bathroom free. Come in! - Hello, hello and...hello. - Mr Bellini. Thank you very much. Are we ready to play? - Come along, this way... - Thank you. You see, I like it. Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Mr Bellini. Thank you. Thank you very much, my friends. Gentlemen. Sir Thomas. - I'm very glad to meet you, Mr Bellini - Thank you very much. I am very glad to meet you too, Sir Thomas. We will play together and have a lot of fun, I hope. Of course. Bellini! The orchestra's playing without me? You're the great Bellini? You know me? Of course. Who doesn't know the great Bellini? Are you sure you aren't confusing me with Elvis Presley? Of course not. Please give me an autograph. With picture? Do you have a fountain pen or a ballpoint? Let's go and sit down so I can rest my rear. Very funny. Introduction. I'd really like to have these. May I? Yes, with the picture of the laurel wreath and the violin. With regards to... Lena. Do you still have time? The musicians are waiting. For you, I have all the time in the world. First class! You two are unbelievable. How did you manage it? Business secrets. Lena and I have something going. That's true. Congratulations. You got married yesterday, didn't you? I have a little gift for you. Unbelievable! A little bow-wow. I always wanted one like this. I don't want it. Why not ? You'd fall in love with it. That's the idea. Aren't you cute! It loves me. What'll we call it? I don't want it in my apartment. I don't want it... In YOUR apartment? Lena... you haven't forgotten, have you... that it's MY apartment? With our jobs... We can't look after it. Who'll feed it? It doesn't eat very much. I make the decisions in my apartment. I've always wanted a dog. Remember what Yvette said last night. When we divorce, I get the apartment. So that's it! Have you had Yvette home? I wanted to photograph her in the four-poster bed. It didn't happen, because Lena was lying in it. Do you work against "Look and Listen" interests? She's uncooperative. Take your puppy-dog and move somewhere else. - It's ME should move? - Yes. Calm down, now. We'll read some letters. . It can help. "Dear LetterBox. I am an older lady who's going to see my son in America." "I'm looking for a young person who can look after my canary and goldfish." "He can live in my apartment for the 3 years I'll be away." Hey, where are you going? To see a lady with an apartment. There I'll have things the way I want. No reason to take it so hard. - Do you really like him? - Yes. - Do you love him? - Nope... How long's this been going on? Ages. - Does he know? - No. And don't say anything. What'll you do about it? What should I do? He's never even realised that I'm a girl. I have a friend that Bastian doesn't know. You don't know him either. He can visit you next week... saying he's from the Housing Board. Rental regulations state that you have to have a child to have an apartment. You and Bastian have to display a small child to the world. That'll make him realise you're a girl... won't it? So you won't need a dog, will you?! You'll have a kid, so I'll keep the pug. What about Olsen and old Jensen? - Are Olsen and Jensen up there? - Yes, upstairs. Ladder! Ladder! Olsen and old Jensen! Olsen and old Jensen! Are they Olsen and old Jensen? Yes. Thanks ever so much! Who is it? Me. Glad you're home. I forgot my key. Did you get the apartment? Only pictures, then it burned. Burned?! You should've been there. There was a funny story with Olsen and old Jensen. Olsen and old Jensen? The goldfish and the canary that I rescued. You can write about it. I'm not writing anything. What do you mean by that? We can't work together any more. - What do you mean? - They're your own words. - I didn't mean it like that. - Get out while I pack. - Why are you going? - Because you're here. Come on... stay! You'll have the place to yourself. Please, please stay. I can sleep in the living room. Same as the other night? You'd already gone to bed. Why should I stay? As I have to tell you about the old lady, Olsen, Jensen and the fire brigade. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Madsen. - Madsen! - Sorry. He lacks a child. Who lacks a child? Press photographer Jens Peter August Christian Dusinius Bastian. Married to Lena Bastian, nee Christiansen. They lack a child. Would you fix that today? Attend to it personally, Mr Madsen. Shall be done. Right away. Coming! Hello. Would you be Mrs Bastian? That's me. Madsen. Housing Board. Come in. Soren was quick off the mark. Isn't your husband Jens Peter August Dusinius? - Who wants me? - Mr Madsen from the Housing Board. - Is there a problem? - We'll see about that. Is this the hall? That's what we call it. The living room? You have to look like the real thing. Meaning? Bastian mustn't twig. Okay if we start now? Would you hold this? Against the wall. No cheating. 4.50, that seems right. You have to keep a straight face! Hold this. You need to say something, like you're from the Housing Board. 7.35. Take it off. Bedroom? - Yes... in here. - Thank you. Nice! May I have your finger? Thank you. Will you measure the kitchen and bathroom too? No, this room is too big. There must be a mistake. This apartment is meant for at least 2 children. You don't need to exaggerate. My dear, it's in the regulations. The records show that there is one child on the way. - Is that correct? - Oh yes, that's right. Well, we'll need to be sure about that. Can I get that in writing from your doctor? - Yes. - I'll see myself out. 'Bye. I'm giving up the apartment. What for? Don't you understand? There must be limits to what I can expect from you.. You're the best pal a man could have..., but for you to... just because I ... No way. Bastian... It was a joke. The Housing guy was sent by Soren to make you nervous. You fell for it. That was amazing! So there's no problem. It's my apartment. And do you know what? Now I'm leaving. - Legal office. - Yvette? Bastian. The four-poster is unoccupied. That was a stupid idea. What was? The Housing Board man. Now it's all screwed up. What Housing Board man? Your friend. Total dimwit. Said we had to have 2 kids. I didn't send any Housing man. You didn't? I was just joking. To cheer you up. It's not true? So Bastian... doesn't keep the apartment? Calm down, now. I’ll call the lawyer. He'll sort it out. Yvette, this is Soren. from "Look and Listen". I don't want to talk to you or Bastian! So stop calling me! - What happened? - We were cut off. Now it's engaged. Don't hang up. I'll just call again. I'll catch you! Mr Bastian? That's me. This is him. Good grief...! Is that what you look like!? Colonel Arnold Christiansen. This is my wife. We're Lena's parents. Now I get it. Look at him, Arnold. Happy and surprised. He's just like what Lena wrote. Lena wrote? It was probably a disappointment that we didn't come till now... Eh, son-in-law?! - May we come in? - Yes, of course. We'll only be here till morning. Just a lightning visit. - I've had a royal audience. - Congratulations. Must be back in Jutland tomorrow morning. But we had to say hello to the newlyweds. Of course. - Where's my little girl? - You have children with you? Halt! She means, where is Lena? Sorry. Of course... Won't you come in in? You've been lucky to get such a lovely apartment. It wouldn't have happened without Lena. Yes, I'm well aware. Lena's always been strong-willed, and got what she wanted. Just look at the furniture. You didn't have much say with that! Tell me... the picture... What does it represent? It doesn't represent anything. Wait... Of course it does... And I shall find out what it is. How did you do your military service? Halt! I love to answer the questions I ask. You're tall... The air-force! Arnold, come and look at this! Imagine! The kids have a real French four-poster. Isn't that wonderful? Four-poster! Air force! What did I tell you? I shan't be photographed in anyone's wonderful French four-poster bed. But it's a great idea. Bastian doesn't need to take the pictures. Remember why you rang. Is your boss in? He's not? Don't hang up! We aren't finished. Editorial. That's me. Your in-laws... our in-laws... Colonel and wife. Yes, they're here right now. They're here for dinner. Are they suspicious? Don't be so suspicious! Daddy is so conservative. Be a bit liberal-minded and modern. Put the potatoes on. Use your imagination. It's no joke. The electric grill. It's in the fridge. Shall we say 8 o'clock? See you then. What does this painting represent? Have you booked the hotel room? No. Lucky you reminded me. I'll do it now. What are you doing? Tasting. What's for dinner? - I love... - exciting new dishes. Especially for you. This is a completely new dish. Before Lena gets home... You know that she was an only child, and was always spoilted? Keep a firm grip on her, but do it lovingly. How do I do that? Like this. Charlotte. Charlotte! Yes? I'm coming. Charlotte. Where are you? I'll carry on here. Remember now. I'll remember. There's not a room to be had anywhere. What'll we do? I ask the questions and answer them myself. Welcome! Well, here she is! Welcome, sweetheart! We should have loved to have been at the wedding. Don't hassle her. She's got herself a good considerate husband. That's the main thing. - Where is he? - In the kitchen. He's making dinner. Good god! Oh no, just a moment. - How's it gone? - Great. What have you made? I don't know. Mixed grill. - What's in it? - Imagination. Plus everything in the fridge. Look at that. There... Can you take it? I'll take the platter. Come on. See you there. Don't wait to eat. Get it while it's hot. Come on, Daddy. - I'll serve. - Shouldn't I do it? Special food requires special serving. Some from the other side as well. Use the spoon for that... ...mother-in-law. And some shallot-bulbs... Charlotte! Stay there! Bastian, careful! I think I've got it! Bastian! Are you finished? Welcome! This tastes wonderful. Yes, it tastes good. When were you in Africa? Me? In Africa? I haven't eaten such good 'bwana magonga' since I was in The Congo. - Sorry, what's it called? - Bwana magonga. I'd forgotten how it was pronounced. But where have you managed to get elephant steaks? Wait! I can answer that! From an elephant! Isn't it silly using a formal "you" with our son-in-law? Totally idiotic. Cheers! You always wanted a traditional wedding. Yes, I can do that next time. Next time? You're not divorcing, are you? Never. Lena I divorce...?! What a ridiculous idea. I'm very happy you feel like that. Divorce is a capitulation where the man surrenders... ...and lets the enemy set the peace terms. What are you whispering about, Arnold? Can't we be in on it? Can't you two talk about knitting and baby-sitters or something? Knitting? Babysitters? - You don't mean you're...? - No, Mummy. Not at all. Female tactic... Planned withdrawal. Male tactic... Lightning attack against the strategically important points. The enemy gives way, but it's an ambush. If you surrender, it's divorce. You make sound so terrible. It is. She gets everything... the apartment... and half of all you own. That's for me. I'll get the door. Who on earth could that be? Forward march! Right wheel! Halt. Left turn... Forward march! What's that about? I rang for two camp beds. Who's sleeping in a camp bed? Your mother and I. There were no hotel rooms. You're staying here tonight? You've nothing against that? Not... not in the least! You and I can sleep in the camp beds. You and Charlotte can sleep in the four-poster. No way! You'll sleep in the four-poster with Lena. No. I'll sleep with Arnold. We can't take the newlyweds' bed!. With Arnold! Hasn't this gone far enough? Had dinner with you. No photos in "Look and Listen". Can't help it. Ate dinner with Bastian. No photos either. We can go home to my place. Went home with Bastian. No photos in "Look and Listen". Give him a few beers, he'll come running. Stop grumbling. Get to the point. What point? I want to be photographed. Here and now. You can't. Why not? There needs to be some inspiration... The right environment. Atmosphere, nice music. And time... oceans of time. That sounds so dumb. What? You heard me. You talk to me as though I were an idiot. I'd rather sleep with my mum. You'll do as I say! Otherwise I'll think we're a lot of trouble. - I want to sleep with Arnold. - Stop talking rubbish! - I like Arnold. - So do I. You can apologise. They're my parents. - They're really nice. - Think so? So, now...? How about canasta? We've tried that so often. Couldn't we work out something new? There... you got what you deserved. Our son-in-law's a quick learner. How do you mean? I gave him a few tips regarding Lena. Go to bed. We need to be up early. Oh, Arnold! No, Bastian. You mustn't look. Drats! Three. No, it's only one, and I have it. Two. Nude. You're so cheeky! You win, you lie down. Six. You can't have six. I wanted to see if you were asleep. I can't play any more. You're a lot tougher than I am. A game of canasta? Okay. Arnold? Arnold? How about a little... canasta? In the middle of the week?! What is love with eight letters? Devotion. Devotion. Doesn't fit. Try fondness. That fits with the F. What's F for? Love with 7 letters. Fervour. Yes... exactly. "Taken" with five. Loved. Did you say loved? - Have you ever loved? - Yes. Does it feel nice to be in love? No. It's remarkable... It feels nice right now. Charlotte. Charlotte! Yes, Arnold? It's obvious! It's a horse! Lena? Lena! Lena "Went to the train with my parents. Didn't want to wake you." "All the best. Your Lena. " Madsen, from the Housing Board. Remember me? Excuse me, why did you do that? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Hasn't there to be some misunderstanding? Tell Soren I said thanks for the visit. Soren? Explanation? Madsen. - What Madsen? - Housing Board Madsen. He's a real Housing Board official. I told Lena that. He's nothing to do with you? Apartment... kaput! - Where's Lena? - But you've no apartment. Where? She's at the Angleterre Hotel interviewing Jarl Kulle. The Swedish Professor Higgins? The Casanova? Why aren't I there? She wanted to arrange it herself. That's terrible! She's my wife. Know what? See you later. Danes and Swedes don't get on. Do you agree? On that subject, one could say... What's her name? She's married to that cool Danish guy ...who's a bit of a musician. She's born in Sweden. Ingrid! Queen Ingrid, that's right! If only Sweden could refrain from thrashing Denmark at football... there would be any racist hatred in Denmark for Swedes. Can I write that? Yes, of course. But lets not talk so much about me, Let's talk about you instead. You saw me in "My Fair Lady". Unfortunately I didn't. Yes, tickets were hard to come by. I'd like very much to do an experiment with you. As you know, Professor Higgens changes the flower-girl Eliza... into a "fair lady", in a matter of hours. I'd like to change YOU into an actress. Appearance-wise you have all the attributes. Nowadays, of course, people are pulled off the street to be put in a film. Stand up. As a journalist, you've no doubt heard of Stanislavsky book "An Actor Prepares." Let's test his system. Improvise. The setting is... Yes, let's make it a hotel room I live here, and you are my... ...mistress. Am I? So let's create a dramatic situation... that allows feelings to develop naturally. You are... jealous. There's nothing so rewarding as a jealousy scene. You've been waiting for me. I just came through the door... and I stop over there. You point at me and say... "You've deceived me." You've deceived me. No... no. You say that as though I'd pinched one of your lollies. You have to put yourself into the situation. You wouldn't have spoken that way, if I'd really deceived you. Try again. You've deceived me. Have I? Who the fuck asked you? Serve the champagne and shut up. Darling... Daaarling! How on earth could I ever have deceived you. We have to stop now. Because this waiter's here? Waiters in top-class hotels are discreet. We'll continue. You say "I'm a deceiver." I'm the one who should be jealous. You deceive me. - Do I? - Every day... with your husband. Is that being discreet? It just popped. Why do you have a camera? Amateur photographer. I promised my kids... if it were at all possible. But pictures... of me... for your children?! Splendid! Keep that expression. This is a fantastic situation. I'm the lover. He's the husband. But I don't know that. He dressed up as a waiter, in order to take photos of us in a compromising situation. But YOU know. Your confused smile and head shaking, were just right. But do you know... that we're married? He's splendid! You have feeling for drama. You have talent. The man in the street. You sound just like you're an amateur photographer who'd take pictures of me and a woman that you love more than anything. That woman who gave you love, deserves your respect. Now you trample on her love... dirty it... annihilate it. But I'm not ashamed of my feelings. I love her. Take your picture and get out of here! Go on! Take the damned picture! And scram! Stop it! Lena! Tell him to stop! Let go of her! Do you think I'd put up with you kissing my wife? You have real insight! Not so aggressive... don't want to over-act. I'll decide how aggressive I want to be.. You nearly hit me! Bastian, stop it! You know each other? I've been trying to explain. She IS my wife. Good Lord! And here I was thinking you had real talent. Hold that pose. My regards to your kids. Nothing to discuss. I want a divorce. Just listen to what I have to say! - You weren't in a hurry before. - I am now. He ruined my interview with Kulle. Interview? he was all over her, trying to kiss her. What's it matter to you? Aren't we married He played the jealous husband, just to get a photo. Do you deny that we are married? I want to divorce. I don't want to. If I'd realised what I was getting into, I'd never have done it. Here's my key. I'll never set foot in your apartment again. I want a divorce. Did you hear what she said? I'll never set foot in your apartment again. I want a divorce. Ladies' LetterBox Are you heartbroken? "Dear LetterBox. I'm a man, but I'm writing to you anyway " "It's complicated. I'm very much in love with my wife." "She is young and pretty, and I'm a big swarthy slob." "it's not surprising she won't see me." "She married me so I could get an apartment." Hey, Soren... A young girl wonders how long it takes to arrange a church wedding. I think there has to be three Sundays in a row. Normally. But she's had a civil marriage. Could it be quicker? I don't know. Ring a pastor. They're the experts. I have a message from Lena. - How is she? - She's fine. She has a good job here. Very funny! I haven't seen her in 3 weeks. What?! - Celebrity wedding in Sollerod? - This afternoon. 5pm. Don't forget. 5pm. I've no idea who the couple are. But no pictures inside the church. That's strictly forbidden. You're not to go in! I'm not? Then you haven't seen me in white tie. - Hi, Lena. - Hi, Bastian. It's been a while. - Are you mad at me? - No. Good. Who's getting married? Who could it be? Don't you know? Yep! It can't be you. You can't marry again. We aren’t divorced yet. It's bigamy. Even if you're the bridegroom? Well... Well, this is a real apartment. What did you expect? A one-roomer? It's so nice! You should see the kitchen. And there's a four-poster bed. Want to see it? Yes. I want to be carried. Good evening. Thanks for last time. Good evening.. I don't understand. Now I understand. Well... good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. I never get the picture. You'd better find yourself another four-poster. Wait a moment You'll want to know what happened with the Housing Board. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
