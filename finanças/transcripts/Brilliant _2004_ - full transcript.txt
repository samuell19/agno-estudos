[sigh] Okay, It's not too late to change your mind. -No. -Local? Thanks. I want you to start counting backwards for me, from 10. 10,9,8,7,6,5... [echoing voices] Obviously, but don't you think that's a little bit radical Elizabeth? Please. [*] Well there goes your childhood. Well that wouldn't be so bad. Obviously, but don't you think that's a little bit radical... [*] Well there goes your childhood. [*] 10,9,8,7... [alarm ringing] Oh god! There you go, next? Sorry. Can I see your ticket please? This flight returned last night. That's impossible. Look. It says Departure: March 23. Yes, that was a week ago, Ma'am. And you can see the first two layers have been removed, indicating that it's been used. Do I look like a complete idiot to you? That's not for me to say, Ma'am. Would you like to speak, with a supervisor? I don't need to talk to anybody! Today is March 23! Next... Sir... [*] It's my purse... [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] What is the point of this picture anyway? Don't you think it's nice to have some kind of record? Yeah, like we really want to remember this. You are so grumpy. When are Liz and Joel getting here? Her name isn't "Liz". Elizabeth... Everybody's waiting... I can't I was so supposed to be in O.R. two minutes ago! It'll take a hundredth of a second. Come on... Come on... You're welcome! -We did it. -Did what. Hello. Hey. We found the gene sequence for hyper dopamine. Got the whole thing mapped out. Whoopee. More brownie points for the Browner. Okay, everybody squash in... real close. And now Ricki's going to pull out a gun and shoot us all, thus ensuring she gets next year's neurosurgery spot. Ha... ha... That's really funny, Joel. Okay... Ready? Everyone.., say "vasectomy". Vasectomy. Okay, great I guess you'll have to do without me. That's nice... Oh crap... Thank you... Elizabeth... I didn't think you were going to make it. Are you kidding? You didn't talk to anyone about our little development, did you? Um... I might have mentioned it... Well you know how valuable it is. So lets keep it under your hat for a while. You are ready to make the initial incision...? Yes sir! Now we're going to raise a skin flap starting left of midline, extending temporally and ending in the preauricular area. Ms. Braden. Go ahead. Elizabeth? Somebody? Help me. I'm all right. -What was that all about? -I'm okay. -I have to go back. -Whoa! Shit! Tom, you shit! What? You'll get another chance. Just rest. This is bullshit. I'm okay. I have to go back. Sit down. You've been hogging Dietrich all year. Share your toys, Elizabeth. Your pupils are dilated, Elizabeth. What are you taking? -Nothing! -It's those all-nighters. I told you about those all- nighters. You leave her alone. You need to back off. I blew it. What are you talking about? He was going to let me... never mind... It's okay, it's gonna be okay. [distant noise] Ricki? Anyone? Sleeping with mommy again? You're sick. Looking at those pictures isn't going to help you remember. It's just, sometimes I think I can see... our backyard..my house... my mom's smile... And then I just wonder if I've been looking at these pictures too hard... I don't know the difference anymore between a real memory and something I've imagined. It was a long time ago. I know. Fuck Adam! Put it there. What's the matter? It's just that somebody broke into the lab today. I mean only stepped out for a second. When I came back, all my notes and disks where gone. Who would want to steal that stuff? All kinds of people. I'm gonna have to be more careful. Did you lose a lot of work? Nothing I can't copy out again. From memory... Yeah. Well, then if you can remember everything why do you have to take notes? Cause, I just want to be normal. Elizabeth, I don't want you working alone late at night anymore. Yeah, right... Joel I have to ask you something. What? You said you weren't going to include neurosurgery in your list of choices. I didn't... Why? Oh ... It's just that I saw something... a printout, it said you've go that position. A printout? I know, I'm sure it's just a prank. Yea, It has to be. My whole submission is based on Cardiology now. You know that! [knocking] Yo! ho! You have to get out of here, prisoner! I just need another minute. Close the door okay, thanks. So this is the gene that gonna give everyone a photographic memory? Hardly. It just affects the brain's ability to produce hyper-doparnine. You're really not supposed to see this. Sorry. It's going to be public soon anyway. Did you ever figure out why we just don't all have a great memory? Most people's brains down-regulate the amount of hyper-dopamine. It's like nature doesn't really want us to remember very well. Interesting. Okay, we can go now you know. Well, why don't you show me a little more. I can't. Don't tell me any secrets, just show me stuff. Come on, just a little. We found a new restriction enzyme that allowed us to isolate the suspected base pairs responsible for its production in the brain. There are numerous possibilities for treating such degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's. And this treatment would be through gene therapy? Direct injection into the ventricles adjacent to the hippocampus. See this little guy right here? He gets direct injections of hyper-dopamine. But the effect wears off. Now he doesn't see or hear very well so it's not going to hurt him. Okay... here we go... He knows the way. He just forgot. Holy cow. That's cool... Okay, so when will people get enhanced therapy? That's not what this research is for. Well, why not what do you mean, you said that Dietrich determined that the only difference between people like you and the rest of us is that you produce hyper- dopamine in larger quantities. So if I wanted enehnced memory... I get the therapy... No no, it doesn't work like that. Why not? Well, first of all, you don't need it. You're already as smart as you need to be. There's a price to having this ability. I remember too much. I remember everything. Every smell, every sound. I mean, you know, if I could just forget my parents' accident things would be so much easier. Please, you get by, okay! Well look at it, at least tell me that Dietrich is giving you co-authorship. You practically discovered this whole thing for him. I don't know. Elizabeth! This so typical of you. You would just go on with your whole life and let him get all the glory. Well it's his... No, no it is not! You've been working on for two and half years. It's because of you that you've had this break-through. Hey! Take what is yours. You're such a push-over. Am not. You are. Now listen to me. Seriously... Hello? You're smart and you've risen to the top. But I've seen you stop right at that point when you could go further. Like right now. Right, come one, let's have a drink... Okay. We need that genome sequence now, before they file it with the patent office. We put you in there for a reason, so get us some results. Adam Johnson... Naomi Di marco... Ricky Smith... Joel Smith... Well shall we? Let's do it. [imitating fanfare] Oh my God! I got it! I got it! Congratulation, you deserve it. Congratulations. So? Cardiology. [*] [*] Sorry I'm late. [*] We're almost done. [*] Adam is everyone down stairs? Yea, I think so. Do you want one? No thanks. Adam, heads up! Joel... I've got a surprise... for you... for us. Seven "fun-filled days and nights" at the El Mirador in Cancun. Oooooooooo. What's the matter? I think you should have asked me first... You said you wanted to go someplace! I was counting on visiting my folks... I got a special last-minute rate. ... having you meet them finally! You didn't say anything about that. We've been busy. I didn't dream you would do this. Chill out Joel! Stay out of this! I don't think I can get a refund. Perfect. Just perfect. Why can't we see your parents some other time? Like on a weekend or something? You okay? Yeah. He's mean, mean, mean. -Hi! -Hi! So you got your second choice. That's pretty good. Yea, I've made up my mind. Adam, don't say that. It's okay. I'm okay. I've reconciled myself to the way things have to be. I really wish there was something I could do for you. Well, there is kind of... I was thinking... since it looks like you have an extra ticket... I was thinking that may be I could buy it from you. You mean go on the trip with me? Yeah... Together. You and me? Yeah... Well... I think Joel is probably gonna change his mind and anyway how would that work? We'd have to share the same room with me? Hey, we're already sharing the same space here. I won't bother you. I'll let you know later. Okay? Okay. Just let me finish. Okay? Okay, see you... See ya at the party. [creaking] [*] [*] [*] I'm not too sure... I'm just trying to decide... A drink fit for a queen! No thanks, Tom. Oh, come on! Seventy-two bucks a bottle! What, not good enough for you? Come on! Cheers. Bottoms up. [laughing] [*] [*] -You see Ricki? -What? Ho, I don't know, she was here and she said she had to go do something. Just get a drink I've decided a gin'n tonic! Comin' up. Hey. Hey, so you gonna go on this trip with me? I told you what the deal was, Elizabeth. Yes you did. But I thought you'd change your mind. Why? What is this? A second chance? Some horrible thing is going to happen if I don't say yes? I'll go by myself if I have to. So go. That's what you want? What is this? Is that a threat? What could I possibly threaten you with? You're obviously choosing not to be with me. I'm choosing? Yeah. Your drink. Joel.. what's going on with us, I mean what's happening? I don't understand! Come on, let's go talk about this someplace else. Joel please? No. [*] Hey, Elizabeth? Elizabeth? So what is going on with the trip? Can I come with you? [*] [glass breaks] [*] [*] [*] [alarm ringing] Oh god! Shit! There you go, next? Sorry... Can I see your ticket please? Um, hmm... Here. This flight returned last night. That's impossible. Look. It says Departure: March 23. Yes, that was a week ago, Ma'am. It's my purse... -Elizabeth! -Joel! What's the name of the resort in Cancun that you stayed at? I don't know... El Mirador. But I knew that already. Okay, then what was the last thing you remember in Cancun? That's just it, I don't remember being in Cancun, I don't even remember leaving. Your memory's gotta resume at some point... Okay, okay lets work backwards. Do you remember me picking you up right now? NO! Yes, of course. Elizabeth, just... Do you remember getting off the plane? I told you I woke up at home this morning. Oh... right... Okay, I am sorry, right... What do you remember prior to the black out period? The party. The party... You passed out... I passed out? You were drunk. I had to carry you home to sleep it off. Oh, jeez... Joel... Yeah. Did we break up? No... no, no, we didn't. It's impossible... But you're tanned Elizabeth! I know I am tanned, but I don't know how I got this way. Okay, just relax... -Where is Adam? -Why Adam? Because he is the last person I saw. Where is he? I don't know. I am not Adam's keeper. Fine! Okay, hold on a sec. No I am taking a shower. Hold on! What are you doing? Take a look inside your suitcase? That's my suitcase! Exactly, so then you can tell me if you recognize this. Does this look familiar? Take a look Elizabeth this is important. Okay! Do you remember buying that? I don't remember. Oh my God. [*] What, what it is Elisabeth? [stammering] Just pieces... What pieces? Like feet, and water. I don't know... Well, do something else... -Oh my god... -What... -Nothing. Something's coming back? Nothing. Yeah, looks to me like somebody had a great vacation. You prick! That doesn't seem too be bad. You may have a minor concussion. How do you feel? I have a headache. Okay. Now Elizabeth, you know there are all kinds of possibilities for this kind of memory loss. We'll have to run the usual tests. Sorry, sorry. You've undergone some kind of stress there. It's obvious you've been in the sun a lot. Did you use some protection? Sunscreen? A hat? I would have. You could be dehydrated... Had sunstroke... What's this? I don't know. Okay, my dear, you're going to be here for a while. I'd really rather- No now... Today you're a patient. We are going to need blood and urine and up to neurology for a scan. By the way, I tried to reach you last week... needed some help me in getting the submission in order. The patent application! I'll get onto it right away! No, no, it's okay, it's almost done. Just let me know before you go away. Thank you. Joel, this is so humiliating. You've got to get me some clothes. Now? Please. I have to go all the way back to the dorm, don't I? Joel... Come on? I have nothing to wear for when I am done with all these tests. Of course I will. Okay? Could you bring my lab coat? And something to eat... I'm famished. Okay. Thanks! Okay, uh... [*] I don't remember taking these. Who took this picture?! Self-timer? I mean the pool is kind of familiar... and the beach... but the rest... I suggest you call Adam if you need anymore errands run. Where the hell is Adam? I can't find him anywhere! I don't know. I haven't seen him. Hey come talk to me. Get back here. Come on. What's going on with you? How was your vacation? Oh, you don't want to know. It's unbelievable! Look at these. What you've got? Well that's great but why you're not in any of them? Well, I'm in one actually. [whistles] There is no way we could have slept together! We must have been fooling around. I don't know. look like love to me. I don't feel anything for him. Well, what's going on between you and Joel? I don't know, I mean, he's not very understanding. But I can't blame him. When you look at these, I can imagine what he thinks! There you go again. What? You are always giving Joel the benefit of the doubt! I told you: Joel is looking out for number 1 which is what you should be doing some more off. I guess you're right. As always. What would I do without you? Thanks. -Oh shit... -What? They want me to go to that fiberoptic brachoscopy meeting at McMaster. Are you gonna be okay? Oh yeah. You know what? I've got to find Adam. This is nuts. -Are you sure? -Yeah, yeah. -Good luck... -Thanks. [scream] What are you doing in my room? Elizabeth, you're looking at me like I'm some kind of ghost. What's wrong? I have to tell you something. I don't remember the trip. Something's wrong with me... probably neurological... I had a bunch of tests done today. What part don't you remember? Most of it. I only remember flashes. Adam, I have to ask you something. Did we sleep together? Oh Jesus Elizabeth, don't tell me you don't remember that... Adam, I don't feel anything for you... in that way. ... you did. You said you loved me. I'm sorry. What is wrong? I just don't remember. Elizabeth, come on. I read about this.., the smallest thing,... a touch... a scent.. a sound can jog it back into the conscious mind. We found this on the first day. We walked together on the beach... Do you remember? You were so quiet... You did not seem to mind the company! This was... I think this was from that sand bank we found when we went kayaking. [*] [*] [*] You livened up a bit over the next couple of days. We did some stuff. We went swimming... walking and sailing. We found this one in that peninsula right in front of the hotel. You remember? I know... [*] I just remember flashes. Adam... You remember, don't you Elizabeth? I know... What else do you remember? [creaking] Somebody's here! You have to get out. Shit. Joel, wait... Come on Joel! Adam snuck into my room. Oh grow up! What do you think? That's pathetic. It's not pathetic, it happened to be the truth. Joel, I need you right now. I need to know there's someone in my life that I can count on. That's not what Ricki told me. Ricki? She said I shouldn't stand in the way of your happiness. Why is Ricki talking to you about us? Why don't you ask her? Ah. Elizabeth. Come in. Sit down. It's a tumor. A brain tumor. It doesn't appear to be malignant based on what I can see on the scan... here... but, you know, we can't be certain until we get tissue. Let me see. The right temporal lobe: Wonderful. I guess there's not a lot to talk about, is there? We can open up the schedule for you. Get you in there as quickly as possible. Oh God. You know there's a high probability that this can be completely resected. Maybe we can delay it for a while so I can get a head start, then I can- Elizabeth... You need to have the procedure done as soon as possible. Yes... to avoid any permanent brain damage. It's obvious this is the cause of your memory loss, and that episode where you lost consciousness in the operating theatre. Now we can get you in probably at the end of next week. What about my year? You're going to have to forfeit this year's residency. You know the critical recovery period is at least 6 weeks and than it may take many months before you will feel yourself again.., that is, if there haven't been any complications. That position needs to be filled, Elizabeth. It needs to be filled, now. It has to be done this way, Elizabeth. We can't put patients under your care without being fully certain of your abilities. Let me see the stats. The other tests look okay. But I do think it would be a good idea if we... get you started on [unclear]. We're so close, you've got to make her believe that this all happened. Otherwise, we'll have to make alternate arrangements. Jeez, what are doing? Hey. Hey. Hey. Leave me alone! Stop it! What's the matter with you? I have a brain tumor. Oh my God. Dietrich says it's probably not malignant. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I didn't believe you. What're you talking about? I thought it was an act... this whole 'not remembering'... I'm really sorry. I can't believe this is happening. I've lost the residency... I have to start over. ... It's like a fucking prison term... A nightmare... I'm nowhere. I'm nothing. Hey, hey, listen to me, listen to me. I'm here. I know I'm not much... but I'm here. I love you. And you love me. And you know it. And that's the only thing that counts, right? I'll help you, I'll help you get through this. I'll stand by you. It will be okay. [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [*] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [noise in distance] [*] [rattling in distance] [*] Ahhh! Did I scare you? I'm sorry, I am sorry. That was really stupid! Sorry! Okay, I need to talk to you. You know when I flossed my teeth. For the first time last week ... listen it's important... my gums bled. Why didn't I floss my teeth last week? Do you ever remember me not flossing? Maybe you were having to much fun to worry about it. No, It's like I was a completely different person. Okay? There are to many unexplainable things like my tan. how did I get this tan? Is there a point to this? Yes listen. I supposedly bought new sunglasses down there. But they don't really fit. Why would I do that? They are those weird kind. I would never buy those. I like people to see my eyes. Okay, Adam he, he tells this long story of how I ate so much but I lost eight pounds. How could I loose that much weight if I stuffed my face. Joel, I think I am loosing my mind... Wait... this will prove it to you. This is the top I wore when I got my tan but it's not my bathing suit. This top matches these tan lines but I remember wearing my bathing suit. It's like I was there but I wasn't there... or someone else went and I went somewhere else. Well there is just one explanation - ... you're in the twilight zone. Exactly, I never went with Adam. Somebody else went. Adam took somebody else with my ticket and my luggage and tried to make it look like I went... Why? I am not sure... Where could you have possibly gone? I mean you weren't here, I did not see you. You know constructing some bizarre scenario from insignificant details like eating, sunglasses, floss... -No! -Floss? Wait a minute. Listen to me. Look, okay, what about this? Do you remember that picture of Adam and I in bed together? Ya, what about it? Okay, do you remember the design of the sheets, Look, palm trees. The same sheets... Let me guess? Same as these? Yes. You stole them from the hotel. No Adam did. It was the last picture on the roll. it could have been taking anywhere... even here! Well what this is all about? He has some weird crush in me. Okay. I think he wanted to make me think that I was in love with him. He tried to seduce me earlier. What if he had sex with me without my consent? Come on Joel. I honestly don't feel anything for him. Now you're sure you remember stuff from the trip.. Look, I don't know if I remember something or I've made it up? I think I was desperate to remember something that I created all these images in my mind. Joel; I need your help. Please help me. I don't know... It's like you're flipping out! Well it's possible with my condition... What condition? Um... The C.T. scan found a one centimer temporal mass. What? ... it's pretty small... Oh no. Oh my God Elizabeth... But they still want me to take a year-off... Oh my god, Elizabeth. I had no idea... I've been such a prick. I'm so sorry. That's explains it! I mean that's why all your perceptions are distorted. I know, I mean it does paranoiacs episodes but these are still to many discrepancies... Will you stay with me tonight? I don't think it's such a good idea. Why not? Come on... What? You have a tan! Took you long enough to notice! I know how I you got that tan. You went away with Adam, didn't you? So what. You weren't gonna go anyway. Hold it. I want some answers. Adam said you weren't gonna go. So I went. If that's not the case it's between you and him. This is some kind of joke, isn't it? A prank? Tell me exactly what happened! Nothing happened! Adam's a bore. Look, I don't want to be a part of this. A part of what? My CT scan's a fake! It's not me! Someone outputted another person's scan with my name on it. Your condition-- I don't have a condition, look at the scan! Whoever it belongs to had surgery before, there's evidence of an old clip. It can't be me. See? She's right. You've definitely never had neurosurgery? No, no. This belongs to somebody else. In light of this development, I request that I be reinstated into the neurosurgery program. The real problem is... Joel would have to be willing to give back the neurosurgery position... -Joel? -He was the next candidate. ... And there's another problem your restitution would create for us at this time. Which brings me to the main reason we're all here today. Dr. Dietrich... I went to the patent office yesterday to start the process of registering the results of my research, only to be told that late last week... Somox Industries submitted the same data. They beat us to it? It was our data. You think I gave it to them? Sold it, more likely. That's ridiculous! Well, luckily the data was flawed. So it's no good anyway. But so much of it was the same that it had to come from the original research. But, you know somebody's been trying to steal our work. There was that incident where disks and notes were stolen- The only one and you staged it as a smokescreen. That's insane. How do you suppose I gave them the genome sequence when I don't know the encryption key myself? You recited it from memory. You know you can do it, Elizabeth. Did you lose a lot of work? Nothing I can't copy out again. From memory? And that's why the information was flawed - Because as incredible as your memory is, Elizabeth, it's not always perfect. I did not do this. You better come right away... something terrible has happened. [rope creaking] Security! Don't just stand there! Get him down! Security, now! Lift him up! Lift him up! Dear Elizabeth, I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I have... been part of causing you so much pain. You were supposed to fall in love with me. I have done such a terrible thing. I can't believe Joel is getting all your love when he has been devious. He never cared for you the way I do. I can't live with myself if I can't have you. Adam. You better call the police. You're starting to draw too much attention. We need you to get the entire genome sequence now, before it's too late. [sobbing] Come here. Come here. It's okay. Come here. Shhh... Listen to me - this is not your fault. This is not your fault. Okay? It was Joel. Somehow it was Joel... What are you talking about? Joel is behind all this... Adam never would have wrote about him otherwise... Honey, Adam was so jealous of Joel. He's been jealous of Joel for a long time. There's more going on... I know what I need to do! What? Hyper-dopamine. Direct injection. Run that by me again. Direct injections into the hippocampus ventricles. Into your brain? That's how I can find out what happened. It was your idea to apply the technique to a human being. Okay, but not to you. How can you even think of doing that? I won't. You will. Okay, and why would I do that? So I can find out what happened. Obviously. But don't you think that's a little bit radical, Elizabeth? Please? No! No way. I need your help. Think about it. It could be a medical breakthrough. and on top of it I'll know what happened. You wanted into this field. This is your chance to make history. It's just an injection... ...into your brain ! And what if I miss and bingo, there goes your childhood. Well, that wouldn't be so bad. Okay, Elizabeth, what if something really goes wrong? You need to think about that. When is that ever not a question? [sigh] Okay. It's not too late to change your mind. Local? Thanks. I want you to start counting backwards for me from 10. 10,9,8,7,6... What the hell are you doing to her? Can't breathe! Tell me now or I'll break your neck! Experiment! Her idea! You're injecting her with that whole hyperdopanine stuff! You think I don't know what you're up to? Oh Jesus... I got him. It's okay. Okay... [*] [*] [music warps and distorts] [*] [*] [glass shatters] [*] Elizabeth? Elizabeth, can you hear me? Do you know who I am? Ricki... No. That is not correct. You will not remember who is speaking with you. Do you understand? Yes. Now, I want you to make a picture in your mind of the first screen showing the ATGC sequence of the hyper-dopamine gene. Have you done it? Do you see the screen Elizabeth? Of course. I want you to start reading the letters from the beginning. Go... Okay, listen to me. We need to concentrate. You have to concentrate and speak faster. T C C A T K C C What are you doing? Ah, I'm , I'm watching over Elizabeth and working on a report. C-T-A-A-C--C-T... That's the gene sequence... You're stealing the gene sequence. You've drugged her? Okay... you can help me. Are you out of your mind? There's a lot of money at stake here Adam... I'll cut you in. I don't care about your money... What did you give her? I gave her some benzodiazepine, okay! She's fine. [sluggishly] Triple C... That's enough Elizabeth. Stop... Listen to me. All I need is a week and she was supposed to go on this trip with Joel and he flaked on her. She said she would go with me. What? When did she say that to you? She said she was going to let me know. Okay, okay, that's good, that's good. You go on the trip, you use Joel's ticket... take her bags with you... make it look like, she went. What? Why? Because, because, that will give me the week that I need and I can do this. This is crazy Ricki! You need to take someone with you okay. And as soon as you get back I'll bring her around. She'll know that she didn't go. No, I'll make her think she went with hypnosis. Hypnosis? Yeah, I can make her think she's in love with you. Yeah, you like that, huh. Yeah, you guys went on the trip together. You two had a wonderful time and you got real close. You even made love. She'll be confused. She'll think she's had a blackout. But she'll remember the passion when she wake up, she'll fall into your arms. Why should I do this? We were gonna go on the trip anyway together? Maybe we would be fallen in love for real. Oh, wake up and smell the coffee, Adam! It would take divine intervention to make that happen. This will work. Come on, she is all yours! ... walking along the beach... you feel the sand on your feet... you feel the warm ocean breeze caressing your body... you feel the sun's radiance soaking into your skin... Adam is walking near you... you like his presence... it's comforting... Elizabeth I want you to look down at your feet... see the footprints being left behind you in the sand... and now you see it... the shell... - half-buried in the sand... you reach down and pick it up... His warm hands touching your body, finding every secret spot. Your body trembles with excitement and desire. ... you are in love with Adam. He is giving and he's kind. He is everything you've ever wanted in a man... you will forget everything that happened here regarding the gene sequence you gave me. You won't remember anything except the fact that you did go on the vacation with Adam and you will remember everything I helped you to remember that happened there will all be completely real to you Elizabeth. Do you understand? Yes. When you wake up in the morning, you will feel as though you've just returned from the trip. There will be no doubt in your mind that you went down south with Adam and that you fell in love with him on that trip together... just as you remember it... [*] [*] How you feeling? -Huh? -Okay. You look like you're in one piece. Ya. Well, did you remember anything? No... Nothing. I went blank. It's okay, it's okay... Maybe you just need a couple of minutes to come around. [gasp] Elizabeth, Elizabeth, he attacked me. he attacked me. I was terrified. I subdued him with an anesthetic... and I think he had heart failure... okay? I tried to revive him... I don't now what to do right now okay. I don't know what we should do. I think we have to get rid of the body. We do. Listen to me. There's no way that we'll talk our way out of this. There will be endless interrogations... and... and... a long trial... And I'm going on with my life! And so are you. Okay, listen to me, listen to me. We will create a phony patient.. Elizabeth, listen to me! No! You pull yourself together. [sobbing] We will create a phony patient. Okay and we will cremate him as a John Doe, okay? We have to do this. Okay? Okay? I am gonna get ready. I know that this is very difficult for you Elizabeth, this is one of those times we talked about. Okay? This is a point of decision when you could go further. It has to be quick, decisive, action. I know it's you. I remember everything. [loud crash] Joel? Joel? Joel, it's okay Joel. Joel, it's okay. Joel... It's okay Joel. Hold that. Hold that down. Holy shit! What happened? You okay? Ya, I'm okay, come on what happened? It was Ricki. She was a thief... a pro... She stole the gene sequence from my memory. That week... she kept me semi- conscious the entire time, she extracted it letter by letter. Copied it right into her computer. So that's how it got to Somox but why would she risk her entire career? There's no way she was a real student. Probably hired by Somox a few years ago, paid her really well... Dietrich, he never let her near the research so she got as close to it as possible by pretending to be my friend. [crying] But the sequence was incomplete. Right. That's because my memory of it was imperfect. I'll bet she was counting on remembering it after undergoing the gene therapy treatment. But she wasn't expecting me to remember what really happened. So when I woke up and saw that you were okay there was no way I was going to let her know I remembered everything... including the entire gene sequence with crystal clarity. So it really works. There's not much we can do now. It's pretty much over. Murder... Self defense... Honey... No one will believe me... You're going to have a great career, you're going to be a great physician. We're going to get through this. End of story, okay? We have to get rid of the body. What do you mean? She was going to dispose of you. Oh my god. Whoa... This is how I felt after I had that drink at the party... ...and when I passed out in the O.R... You remembered things amazingly well, Elizabeth. Except there is one thing you keep forgeting - the power of suggestion is even stronger. Do you see the screen Elizabeth? Of course. Okay, I want to start reading the letters from the beginning. [sobbing] Ricki, Ricki, I'm sorry. It was me, not Ricki. [sobbing] Let's see if your new treatment can help you remember the complete genone sequence, okay? Everything's fine Elizabeth. Ricki... Ricki, she... Everything is okay! Now Joel explained everything. Where is she? She disappeared before we could catch her. No doubt she's gone back to Somox. We need you to get in there and pose as a student. Disappeared? Is she okay? I wouldn't be too concerned... after what she did to you. What's going on? Joel saved you. Ricki tried to give you an unauthorized operation. Well... Where's Joel? Resting I guess. You know he never did explain why he was resigning so suddenly. The residency in neurosurgery is yours... if you can pull yourself together. Hey! I'm sorry I doubted you. I should have been more supportive... after all that we've been through. You believe me? We'll even support in a law suit against Somox if you want. You have our full support. We will make the first complete submission and make medical history! Yes... I suppose we will... There you go, next? A reservation for Joel Fisher? Yes, Mr. fisher. One way ticket to Cancun, Mexico. JOEL: Except there's one thing you keep forgetting. ELIZABETH: Ohhh, Ricki. JOEL: The power of suggestion is even stronger.
