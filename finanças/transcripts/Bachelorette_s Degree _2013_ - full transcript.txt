Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (remixed piano music) - Okay guys, gals, we need a show that will knock the socks off all other cooking shows on network and cable TV and we know the viewers love Dominicci, so we have to keep giving them that Dominicci flavor. Now we need a hit to stay on top, gang. Let's do it. - Jeff, that's great, and I know we all agree, but Dominicci's not himself lately. He has to bring energy to the set. Otherwise we're gonna slip in the ratings again this week. - I have an idea. Why don't we change the set? Let's get rid of the GD and do something like put his face up there. People love him, they love his ruby cheeks. He's the show, why not give him a better way to steal the show. - I like it. Dennie, you're his publicist, call him and tell him what we're gonna do. Have his lawyers handle any contract issues. - Sure, Jeff. I think the press is gonna love it. They're gonna wanna know why the set has changed and what it represents. - I love your genius. - (gasps) Oh I have an idea. A tall handsome buff spicy man just wearing this hot red apron only assistance to Dominicci. - Okay. We'll think about it. All right guys, gals, that's enough for now. Enjoy your weekend. Dennie's already getting hers started. I'll see you Monday if you live to tell about it. (hip hop music) - [Dennie] Hi mom! - Hi baby, how was your day? - It was good, ma. - Aye mami, I've been meaning to tell you, those pumps, I saw them this morning, I love them. They are fabulous! - (chuckles) Thanks, Chip. - Work 'em. All right? - [Dennie] All right. - All right. - Bye, Chip. (laughing) - What's so funny? Are you there? - Yeah, ma. - [Voiceover] That was Chip, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Is he still gay? - Sweet as can be. - Well you can straighten him out. He is funny good looking. - Ma, I'm not desperate. - I'm just saying I just want you to know you could keep your options open. Unless you're gonna speed it up with Damien. - Mom, I love you, but stop. Listen, I'm running late and I still have to call Mr. Dominicci and meet Kerra and J. - I was just saying that you really need to do something with your life. Get with Damien. - I love you, mom, bye. Daddy, I wish you were here. (gentle piano music) - I'mma see you later. - Okay, see you later. - Okay, see you later. (beatbox melody) - Hello. - Hey. - What can I get the pretty lady to drink this evening? - What are your specials? - We have free martinis until 7PM. We have specials on chardonnay and white wine, and there's no discounts on liquors or mixed drinks, we lose so much money on those. - Okay, I'll have a white zinfandel. - Coming right up. - Okay. - Hello. - Hey. - Are you all alone on this beautiful Friday evening? - No, I'm actually waiting for some friends. - This is for the lady. I'll have another Merlot. - [Voiceover] Coming right up. - Thank you. That was nice of you. - You're very welcome. It's the least I can do for a beautiful woman like you. My name is Carl. - Hi Carl, I'm Jamie. Nice to meet you. - Hello, Jamie. - [Voiceover] For the lady. - Thank you. - [Voiceover] Merlot for you, sir. - Thank you. - [Kerra] Hey! - Hey, girl! Hey, how was your day off? - I'll tell you about it. - Excuse me, Carl. - Enjoy your evening, ladies. Jamie, it was a pleasure. - Nice to meet you too. Come here girl. - Going by Jamie today, huh? - Yeah. - Okay. Anyway, this day has been crazy. So I went home, change out of my pink dress, wanted to get in something a little different, come out tonight. Traffic was crazy and school, ending a school year's almost as bad as starting a new one. I mean kids are all over the place, right? But in two weeks we're done. I'm giving final exams, I'm wishing those kids well for the summer and I'm done, Steve and I are going away for a little while. Vacation. - Going away! - Yes, some of that, right? (laughing) - Girl. He was too old and had way too much grey hair for me. That's good for you or Dennie. (laughs) - Okay, 'cause he's old? Thanks a lot. - I'm still winding down from taking the BAR exam, I mean it kicked my butt. I'm telling you, as soon as I land a job with the firm, I'm going on vacation to get rejuvenated before I start working. - Wait a minute, but you had an interview today downtown, the real estate firm? - Yeah, yeah. - How'd it go? - It went really well other than the fact that I didn't get a good vibe from the hiring manager, I mean for a minute I couldn't tell whether she wanted me or despised me. - Oh wow, I'm sorry, let me help you with that. - This is so embarrassing. - Look, don't worry about it, people do this all the time in the bathroom. At least we know it's not mine, right? I'm just kidding. Look, no matter the results, I think you and I should keep in contact. I mean I saw everything in your purse, I'm a good guy. Here's the inside of my wallet. Look, oh my gosh, a card. Give me a call. - Okay. - All right? - I didn't get it! I did not, I did not understand what that was about. - That is strange. - Yeah, exactly. - That is weird. - Hey! Hey girl! - Hey, what's up? - Whoa, Dennie, did somebody chase you here? - No, but traffic was a mess, we got changes going on at the studio, reporters keep calling and calling, then Damien's calling, I finally get time for a personal call, it's my mother who thinks something's wrong with me 'cause I don't wanna date a freakin' gay guy, and then I bump into this guy named Chase, right? He's kinda cute, but then he was corny. - Wait, slow down! - Breathe, take a breath. - It's Friday night, you need to relax. - I know, I didn't realize how wound up I was. - It's okay. - Excuse me, bartender, can I have a cranberry juice please? Thanks. - You know what, I had a whirlwind day too, but Steve and I have a dinner engagement tomorrow, so that should be nice. - Aww, that's right. - I (mumbles). - I don't even think I'm doing anything except for Sunday tea with my mom and her usual "when are you and Damien gonna settle down" chat. - Ma Lewis. - So what are you doing this weekend? - Mike tonight and Stan tomorrow night if Mike is no good. - Oh my gosh! (laughing) Nasty. - What?! - That's just nasty. - Grow up! - Thank you. - I'm just not all that attracted to Stan. - Right. - Now Mike. Mike is fine. - Oh we heard that before. - Girl, you are (mumbles). - Fine with a capital F? - No, he just better know what the hell to do. - Oh God! (laughing) Crazy girl. (R&B music beat) (R&B music beat) - Man, man. (water running) (water running) - I know it's time for bed, but how about round two? - No no no no, here's a pillow, there's a blanket on the sofa. - What? - [Jasmine] The sofa, it's downstairs. - J, are you serious? - Yes! I like to sleep alone. So you can have the sofa or you can drive home. - Guess I'll see you in the morning. - See you in the morning. - [Jasmine] Michael. (laughing) - Love you, sweetie. - Love you too. - [Voiceover] Increase in cloudiness with a slight chance of evening thunderstorms and I'm sorry, but it looks like we're gonna have much of the same for the rest of the week. (phone rings) Stick around because after the break we're gonna take a look at exactly what's going on in your neck of the woods. - Damien. - [Voiceover] So stay with us right here. (laughing) - That's so funny. - It's true. - Really? - 100% true. - For real? - It's true, I kid you not. - Oh, I gotta head to my class. My Zumba class. - Okay. - You're more than welcome to come out. Yes! Yes, you have got to come out 'cause I'm leaving! - You're kidding, right? It's Zumba, how can you get a good workout with Zumba? - You will sweat your butt off, I am not kidding. It works your core, I mean it will just work everything. It's awesome. Can be totally free. All right? - I think... - Okay? - I think-- - All right, okay, you are in. I'll see you in there, all right? Don't be late. You got one minute. One minute, Damien. One minute. - 10. (rumba music) - Are we ready to have some fun? Are we ready to groove and move? All right, let's walk it out. Warm it up, we're gonna start with the warm up first, get our bodies all warmed up. You guys look great, thank you for coming today. Let's tap it out, each foot, good. You're gonna place one foot down on the floor. You're gonna start moving that hip. Move it and move it and move it, feel the music. We ready?! Get right into it. Hold those abs in tight and shake what your mama gave ya. Here we go, we're gonna move, we're gonna get into it, bend those knees! Hold those abs in! Yeah, let's turn. Looking good, looking good, come on, woo! And turn! Shake that booty! Come on, shake what your mama gave ya! Yeah! You got it! And turn! Uh huh. (phone rings) - [Damien] Hey, hello? Where you've been? - Hey, sorry I haven't returned you calls, I've been so busy. I'm on the way to my mom's, what's going on? - [Damien] Oh nothing, I was just thinking of you. Thinking of my boo bae. You've been a little hard to reach the past couple of days, are we still on for tonight? - Yeah, sure. - [Damien] Okay, what's wrong? - Nothing, I just... I just had a really long week at work. - [Damien] Okay, now I want you to let all that go. I am gonna pick you up at 7:30 on the dot. - Okay. - [Damien] Okay, and afterwards we'll poon poon poon. - (laughs) Bye, Damien. - [Damien] Bye. - Ma! Mommy, I'm here! - Girl, why are you yelling? - Oh, I didn't see you. Hey mom, where's Robbie? - Oh Robbie went camping with Mark's family, he'll be back tomorrow night. - You let him get home late on a school night? - Yes, but I made him take his homework with him. - When I was a senior in high school, 18-- - Hush. - You and daddy used to never let that happen. Robbie's only a Junior, mom. - Hush! Look. Look. - They're beautiful, mom. When did you... - I got them done last week, I wanted you to be the first to see them. That's why I didn't tell you about it. - You know, daddy would've loved this. - It's my anniversary gift to him. Happy anniversary, Milt. - Happy anniversary, daddy. I love you, mommy. - I love you, Dennie. Now I want you to help me plant the rest of these flowers. - I forgot my gloves, so... - Use mine. Oh by the way, when are you and Damien gonna settle down? - I don't know, mom. - Start shoveling. (gentle piano music) - What about down here? - No, you need to start with the hole so I can get the other plants in. - Oh. - [Mrs. Lewis] Right there. Gonna put some right there. - [Dennie] Okay. Why are you acting so horny? - What do you mean by horny? What's wrong with a man wanting to make love to his woman? - Not when you're licking the fork like a pervert. - Okay, you know what? It used to turn you on. What's wrong? (phone rings) Hello, Kerra? - Hey, hold on, J, are you there? - [Voiceover] Oh yeah, I got you girl! I'm coming! - Yeah, you got 69 seconds, babe! The time starts now! Hello? - Hey J, are you there? - Yes girl, I'm here. Ugh, this guy has just been chasing me around my place, girl I can't wait for this weekend to be over. - Okay, ladies, I have news. I'm pregnant. - What?! - What?! - Oh my gosh, congratulations, when? - I'm so happy for you. When did you find out? - Well I took a pregnancy test this morning, two of them actually, and they both came back positive. So I made an emergency doctor's appointment to take another test, and sure enough it was positive too. - What did Steve say? - Oh he's so excited. He's been ready for awhile. He's been on the phone all day. Family, friends, telling everybody the news. Wait, but this is what he says. "Uncle Pat" or whoever, "Guess what?!" "Kerra and I are having a baby! "And I know it's gonna be a boy!" - No wonder you seem flustered yesterday. - Right, I guess so, but you know, I felt a little weird, but I just thought it was because I was tired. God, you guys. I'm excited, but I'm really, I'm nervous too. More than anything, I just wanna be a really good mom. My mom wasn't a great mom like you two have. - Kerra, I am so so happy for you and Steve. Listen Kerra, you are gonna be fine. - Okay. - Yup, but I'm actually at dinner with Damien, so let me give you a call back a little bit later on, or we can have lunch. - Okay, yeah. Listen, tell Damien I said hi. - All right, bye. - Kerra, you're gonna be a good mom, and I'll call you tomorrow after you-know-who leaves too. And yes, brunch does sound good. - All right, girl. Hey listen, don't hurt that man too bad. - (laughs) Shut up, you don't even know. - Okay, bye. - Guess what? - [Damien] What? - Kerra's pregnant! And she said hello too, she said hello. - Okay, great. Steve and Kerra are having a family. Isn't that nice? - And I get to be an auntie too. Like a best friend kind of auntie, you know? God, this is great! Kerra's having a baby! J's having a surprise party. - A surprise party? - It's next Saturday at J's parents, it's for her passing the BAR. - Am I the last to know? - No, of course not. It's just I've been busy at work and I haven't really had a chance to talk to you. It's really not that big of a deal. - Excuse me waiter, the check please? - Can you wrap this up for me? - Yes, Madam. And how was everything for you this evening? - It was great, thanks. - [Damien] Hey, bro, check please. - [Voiceover] Certainly, sir. - What's your problem? - [Damien] I just wanna get home. So we can... You know. - Is that all that's on your mind? - Okay, where's all this coming from? What is wrong with you? You're not gonna take 15 minutes are you? - Damien. (water running) - She's gonna melt in my arms tonight. - She's gonna melt in my arms tonight. Mmmhm. Listen, sweetheart, I am so sorry I seemed insensitive earlier, I know you had a hectic week. And I did not mean to cut you off when you were telling me that story about your mom. Okay, now go ahead, what happened? - All right, well she had the garden re-landscaped with her and daddy's favorite flowers. All these exotic flowers and I just, I've never seen it so beautiful. You know, it would've been their 30th year anniversary. - 30 years. Wow, that's pretty special. (R&B music) (R&B music) (moaning) (moaning) Baby, thank you. That is exactly... What I needed. - Since when do you say thank you for making love? - Shit. - Damien, do you hear me? - Yeah. What's wrong? - Thank you is something you say when you're making a transaction. This is not a transaction. Are you gonna drop a $50 bill on the sofa? - Dennie, come on now, you know that that's not what I meant. What I meant is thank you for being you. For being the one who meets my physical needs. - Physical. You know what? This is nothing. This whole night has been about sex. - No. - Not about me, but about sex. It's been 11 years since college, Damien. Where are we going? - What's wrong with the way things are? - I need more! - Baby, please calm down. - No! You don't get it. Where are we going, and are we going anywhere? - Yeah, I guess we're going somewhere. I don't have a crystal ball, I can't predict the future, but all I know is how I feel about you. And the way that-- - You know what, just stop. Since you don't know where we're going, I don't wanna do this anymore. Leave. - Come on Dennie, that's not, I know you don't mean that. - Leave, Damien. - Dennie. - Leave. - Dennie, listen. Dennie, Dennie look at me. - Just leave, Damien, please! - Dennie! Dennie! Dennie, open the door, I need my keys, all right? You want me to leave, my keys are inside. Dennie! Woman, you better open this... Woman! I took you out tonight, spent money on you. Now that's what I'm talk... You know what? I know you're in there and I know you can hear me. I'm Damien to the motherfucking Gray, all right? I bust my ass at the firm daily! Daily! You got me out here, all these people out here. Listen, I could have any woman I want, any woman! (dogs barking) (whispers) Any woman! All right? Spanish, Chinese, Indian! And I picked you. You know what? You know what, you don't appreciate me. You don't appreciate the things I do. Pfft! Okay, okay, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine. (car revs) (car revs) (upbeat pop melody) - I love your tie. Purple Friday. - Purple Friday. - [Jeff] How's everyone this morning? - Great. - [Jeff] Good. - We're just fantastic. - [Jeff] None of us made the news this weekend, so that's a good thing. (laughing) - [Jeff] Listen, I brought you all together this morning because I wanted to let you know we have some big changes coming. Dominicci was thrilled about the ideas for his new image. Dennie, thank you for such a wonderful delivery. He was so excited that he wants to take the show to Chicago. - (coughs) Chicago? Oh no no no no no no no no, it's like freakin' two degrees out there in the Winter time. I can't survive that. Plus didn't he hate the cold? - [Jeff] Well Dominicci thinks being in Chicago will help the show. He's ready to go back home and that explains the funk he's been in lately. He loves all of us, especially you, Dennie. He said we're the best production team he's ever worked with, so with that, we all have until Monday to decide if we're going to Chicago along with the show. We're gonna roll out the new look and start taping there next month. I understand it's a big sudden change. Sue and I are talking it over. I just want everyone to take time this week and think it through. We have until noon next Monday to make it official, so let's just produce a great show today like we always do and just give it all we got. Okay? - [Voiceover] Jeff's right, this is pretty tough. But it's a great opportunity. Let's go out and do our best today. And if you need to come talk to me too, feel free 'cause God knows I'm not sure if I'm going, but I know that I love this show and all of you. I want to do what's best. I want to do what's best. - Hey girl, sorry I'm late, the show-- - [Jasmine] I think I just got an offer. The attorneys and partners I met with yesterday were very impressed with my credentials-- - Everything is crazy right now. - Dennie, they just said they have not met a young attorney as sharp and as focused as I am since they hired Sarah Cook, the District Attorney. - Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, keep going, keep going. - Dennie, I just know this is mine and I'm ready! I mean four years at Howard Law, sex barely once a week and it wasn't even good, and at the top of my class. I landed that job! You are now looking at the newest Hilton and (mumbles) associate real estate attorney as soon as they call me to confer. - Aww, I'm gonna pray for you. You deserve it. - Thank you thank you. - Hi, I'm Ralph Newsom, I'm an attorney, I've been listening to your conversation. Congratulations, your credentials are impressive. Here's my card. If things don't work out with that job, give me a call. I'm a partner at Harris, Newsom, and Dunn. - I definitely will give you a call either way. - All right, enjoy your lunch. - Thank you. I'm getting office, girl! (laughing) - You think he wants to do business or sleep with you? - Probably both. (phone rings) (laughing) - Hello, Dennie. - Oh, Kerra wants to do dinner tomorrow night! - Oh, Kerra wants to do dinner tomorrow night! - [Brittany] Hello! Hello! Hello! - Hi, Brittany. How are you today? - I'm fine, just playing Barbies. What are you reading? - Just a novel from my collection. I love to read in my spare time. - You don't have a lot of spare time do you? - No, I work a lot, so that keeps me pretty busy. - My mommy says women like you who work a lot are smart, but you don't have enough time to have a family and that can make you sad, are you sad? - No, I really like my job and that makes me happy. - What do you do at your job? - I'm a publicist for a famous chef on TV. I handle all of the media. The magazines and the newspaper. - Cool! That's what my Barbie's gonna do so she doesn't have to wait for her boyfriend to give her money like my mommy does with my daddy. I'm gonna be like you and my Barbies. - Wow! - Well I have to go. I hope you enjoy your book. - Thank you, sweetie. - Bye! - Bye. (hip hop music) (hip hop music) Okay, well everything looks great. The honorable Jasmine is gonna be blown away. - You guys have done a wonderful job keeping it from her. Amazing, that one. I'm so proud of my baby. - Awww. - And you. (laughing) I'm so happy. - I'm gonna go upstairs and get ready, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Hey. - Hey, how you doing, sir? Mrs. Dominguez. - (mumbles). - Glad you could make it. - Thank you so much, this is my buddy Ron Whunder. - Ron, nice to meet you. - Sir, Madam. (speaking Spanish) Pleasure meeting both of you. - Surely. Are you dating my daughter? - No, I actually don't even know J, but I've heard a lot about her. - All right, you're one less man I have to block, and I have a feeling I'm gonna be busy. - You have a beautiful daughter like her mother. What do you expect? - Yeah, right. - Well hey, listen, we just wanted to say hi and we will see you guys later, all right? - Sure. - All right. - [Mrs. Dominguez] Okay, nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too. - Pleasure. - Bye. (Spanish guitar music) - [Jasmine] We right around the corner from this house. - [Kerra] I have to go, what do you want me to do? - [Jasmine] We gonna miss our reservation. You better (mumbles). - [Kerra] Gonna take me forever, J. - [Jasmine] But we was in all those stores, I just don't understand why you had to make me come all the way to my parents house for you to just handle-- - Are you serious? - All right, all right, Kerra. You know what, I can't deal with you sometimes. I just don't understand why you just can't do things my way. You are so spoiled, I just don't understand why we had, you know what, you go handle what you need to handle, I'mma sit out here and do what I need to do. - [Group] Surprise! - [Jasmine] Oh my God! (laughing) - [Voiceover] Happy birthday! - Hey. You did a good job here tonight. J is really lucky to have you as a friend. - Yup. J's my girl, so we'd do anything for each other. - So are you going to play hostess all evening, or are gonna get the chance to sit down and talk, what's going on? - [Dennie] Talk? - Yeah. - Talk about what? I see you flirting with all the single women here tonight, right? Oh, you know what, I forgot. Not being committed gives you the opportunity, right? - Okay, damn it Dennie, there you go again. Just because I'm having an open conversation with some women does not mean that I'm trying to push up on them, all right? Or maybe I should. Look, you won't talk to me. - What do you want, Damien? - What do I want? I just gotta get my stuff together, all right? I just need some time. - You need time? - Yeah. - Time for what? Time to bang a few more chicks? Or, let me see, time to hang out with the boys or time to come home 'till 11 o'clock at night working for some sorry ass accounting firm that's Uncle Toming your ass? You know what? - What? - Don't yell at me. None of this stuff even matters because I'm leaving for Chicago and I'm going in three weeks. - [Kerra] Really?! - [Jasmine] What?! - Chicago? - I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys. I just, I wasn't clear until now that I wanna go. I have until Monday to make a decision and I'm going. - Dennie, I'm gonna miss you. Although it is gonna be harder for you to help me get rid of my bad dates. - You know I'm gonna miss you too, girl. But look, we know it's only an hour and a half flight, right you guys? So we can do long weekends and I know that you're gonna be here when the baby comes, okay? - Yes. - So look, go for it, do your thing. - Thank you. See that's why I love you guys. Because you're always here for me no matter what. - Absolutely. - And promise me you're gonna listen to me complain when it gets cold, right? - Maybe, yeah. - Yes! (laughing) All right, let's toast it up. Grab that. - I like that. - Cheers. - Cheers to you girl. - Thank you. - Congratulations, girl. - Thanks. - [Jasmine] Come here. - What are you doing here? - Damien invited me. - How do you even know Damien? - From the gym, why, we hang out occasionally. - You know what, forget it, it doesn't matter. You have to get out of here. - What, I'm enjoying myself, it's a nice party, I think I'm gonna stay awhile. - Are you crazy? My husband is on his way here. - My wife is already here. I'm staring right at her. - Ron, I'm serious, you have to get out of here, look, this is J's party, do not ruin it for her. - Ruin it for J? I don't get you. You're more concerned about ruining your friend's party than your marriage? - Look-- - No, when you gonna tell him? Did you think that what happened in the classroom was enough for me? No no no, no, - Look-- you look, I think that you're a special woman, and I'm willing to fight for you right here if I have to. - This is not the time or the place for this. Not here. Just let me celebrate with my friends tonight, okay? - I'm ready, Kerra, are you? - Not here. Just go. (chuckles) - I'mma see you later. - Okay, see you later. - Kerra, shhh. (sobbing) I thought you and Steve were happy. - He is happy, he is. - I had no idea. - I know you didn't know, you weren't supposed to know, nobody knows. I've just been trying to keep this marriage together and I'm trying to keep Steve happy and I just, I don't know if I can do it, Dennie. I don't know how to love him. - Steve is such a good guy and he's so committed to you. - It's not him. It's me. I was so incomplete when we got married. I just, I thought he was gonna be everything else I needed. Truth was I wasn't ready to get married, I wasn't ready, my mom, everybody else pushed me into this, and you know my mom Dennie, she was distant with my dad. Look, I'm pregnant now, I'm gonna have a baby. - Shhh, listen to me, listen to me. - (sobs) I don't know what to do. - I know, I know, listen to me, okay? You can do this, Kerra, I know you. You, listen, you and Steve have the same kind of love that my mom and my dad did. I see it with you two. Kerra, you are not your mother. Do you hear me? You can do this. - I'm scared, I'm just scared. - I know, I know, but you're gonna be a great mom and Steve loves you so much. - I know, I know. - Okay? - I know. - So here's the thing, right? (mumbles). I was trying to talk to her, maybe you could just talk to her. Hey. - What's going on, man? - Good to see you, buddy. Hey Steve, this is Ron, Ron, this is Steve. - How you doing? - How are you? - Hey, everybody, I'm sorry I'm late. I got held up at the office, you know how it is. How you doing? - Doing good. - Hey sweetheart. Hi. - Hey. - You feeling okay? J said you got a little sick earlier. - I'm fine, I'm just glad you made it. - Oh Ron, have you met my wife Kerra? - Yeah, yeah. It's nice to meet you. I have another party to go to, so I'll be... - You out? - Yeah, I'm out, yeah. Can I have my jacket? - Yeah, sure, sorry. - Thanks. - It was nice to meet you. - Later. - I'll see you later. - Yeah, nice meeting you too, man. - Scoot down, scoot down. - Oh, yeah yeah, have a seat. Maybe we shouldn't let you have a seat, man. Mr. Late. - Hey man, you know how it is. Somebody's gotta work around here. - Mmmhm. (gentle synthesizer melody) - Is that my song? Ooh, I think that is my song! Ooh, Dennie, oh that song bring back memories. Your father and I used to love that song. We would hear it in the house and we would rock this house like it's never been rocked before. You talking about sexual healing? (laughs) Your father used to rock my world like it's never been rocked before. (laughing) What did Damien say about you moving? - Huh? - You heard what I said. What does Damien think about your moving? - Doesn't matter what Damien had to say. - So if Damien was "acting right" according to you, would you be leaving? - Yes, because this isn't about Damien, mom. This is about me. I'm going 'cause I wanna go. - Hand me that silk scarf. You know your grandmother made that for you years ago. She could've sold it for over $3,000, but she wanted you to have it instead. You could use it when you come back. You could use it when you come back. - Yeah mom, the lock box key is secure. Okay, just make sure that (mumbles) make an appointment with you first. Then as soon as I get to Chicago I'll call the realtor about possibly selling the house. And make sure you're home so Jasmine can pick up the spare key. Okay, I gotta go. I love you. Shoot! - Does this belong to you? - Yes, thank you so much! - My pleasure. Where you headed to? I promise you I didn't look. - (laughs) I'm going to Chicago. - Oh really? By the way, I'm Brian. Brian McCormick. - Nice to meet you. - I was actually here in DC on business from Chicago. - All right. - Yeah, why don't you give me a call when you get settled and I'll take the opportunity to show you around the city. - Okay. - Have a good trip. - Thank you, you too. (remixed synthesizer music) (remixed synthesizer music) Thank you sir, what do I owe you? - $25, my lady. - All right, here is 30. - Thank you, thank you very much. - May I please have a receipt? - [Voiceover] Sure. I hope you like Chicago. I am from Russia, so the cold weather is no problem for me, but for you I think it will take time. You're a delicate one. - Spasibo, sir. - (laughs) Beautiful and smart. - Thank you. - Goodbye, my lady! - Bye! (upbeat piano party music) (applause) - Hello, Chicago! Thank you for waking up to Dominicci Delicioso, the cooking show that will charm your heart, warm your tummy, and make your taste buds dance. I'm gonna prepare for you something that you can do at home. (applause) I'm delighted to be in the windy city. Boy is it windy, even in July. Just as I was coming in this morning, I saw two toupees blow off of these two old guys that were walking down the street, so when I got to the studio I said to my stylist we're gonna have to glue this baby down. (laughing) I have a real treat for you today. It's a Monday, so I'm gonna prepare something for you that's easy, tasty, and will make your toes wiggle after a long day at work. And you can make enough leftovers for a day or two because who in the hell wants to cook every day? Except me. I make it fun for you. (applause) - Dennie Lewis, welcome to Chicago. - Hi! - I see Mr. Dominicci and his audience are having a wonderful debut show. I know it can be do or die out there, especially starting off in a new market. So why did Mr. Dominicci want to move his show to Chicago? Wasn't the Washington DC market a better fit? - You know, I'm so happy you asked that question. Actually many people wanna know why would Mr. Dominicci move and why would he leave a market where he was doing so well. Well the answer's very simple, Scott. Mr. Dominicci just wanted a change. After being in the DC market for 10 years, he felt that him and his viewers would love an invigorating change in Chicago. With him being in Chicago, they can still view him on TV and Chicago gets a new live show. - So Mr. Dominicci moved his show to a new city, spruced up the show's format, and plans to publish a new urban chic cook book this year. - Yes. - At age 59, he's clearly still able to connect with adult viewers of all ages. What else can viewers expect? - What else can viewers expect? Viewers can expect for Mr.Dominicci to keep dazzling them with his wonderful cooking skills, but how he does it, they're gonna have to tune in. - Thank you, Miss. Lewis. - Thank you. - I look forward to speaking with Mr. Dominicci himself next. - Wonderful, we'll be wrapping in five minutes, so I'll see you out there. - Okay. - Now that I've prepared this wonderful dish of honey roasted chicken, it would be silly of me to enjoy it by myself, so let me choose one of my new Chicago friends to come and enjoy it with me, who would like to join me? Who, who, who, who? (crowd cheering) You sir, come over here and join me! (clapping) Come on down, don't be afraid. (laughs) Oh and you look like you know what it's like to eat a good meal. Tell everybody what's your name and where you from? - I'm Robert Langcaster from Lewisville, Kentucky. My wife and I are up in Chicago celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. - 20th wedding anniversary, how about that, ladies and gentlemen? The only thing I've been doing longer than 20 years is cooking! (laughing) You see, I prepared a chocolate souffle in my eighth grade Home Economics class and right then and there I knew, and everybody knew, that cute little Sarah Clauson was never gonna go out with me 'cause I have a certain flair. (laughing) Now let me get you a piece of chicken right here, Roberto, so you can enjoy and I'm going to enjoy it with you because this is one of my favorite dishes to make. It's a traditional meal that people all over the world enjoy. (coughing) And they especially enjoy the flavoring and the... Oh, he's choking on the whole (mumbles). - [Voiceover] He's choking. - [Voiceover] He's choking! (ding noise) (clapping) (coughing) And the saying still goes if you can't stand the heat, then get out of the kitchen and let me cook, damn it. Just a little bit too much cayenne pepper for the gentleman, we talked to his mama, and she says he still gets choked up over her too. (laughing) Why don't you join your lovely wife in the audience. Thank you very much, thank you. Until next time, ciao! (applause) - That's a wrap. - Hey! - Hi, kiddo. How did the interview go, or did I get screwed with the guy who choked on his chicken? - No no no no, I just had the interview with Scott Reed, everything went great. Nothing but good publicity. Also, when he comes over he's probably gonna try and make a big deal out of the choking. Just, it's natural, it's human. It's nothing, don't let him hype it up. Also, you have an interview at 6:30. You Are On A Roll, international cooking. Okay, so I'll have the (mumbles), I'll get you ready by 3:30. - You know kiddo, you've been working too hard already, you oughta go out, enjoy Chicago! Ciao. - Ciao. (laughing) - Good morning, Dennie. - Good morning, Brian. Nice to see you again. - Pleasure's all mine. I'm glad you called. And that you could make it. I'm sure you throw a lot of business cards to the wayside. - (laughs) Well you know, not all business is good business. - True. - Yes, and I'm new to the city, so I decided why not go out and see Chicago, and you seem like a nice guy to do it with. - Oh, nice guy huh? Okay. - You seem like a nice guy, so... - Trust me, I am. - Yeah? All right, well horseback riding is definitely different. I'm ready. - How about we go? - Okay. - You truly are a brave one, Dennie. New to Chicago, willing to ride a horse for the first time with a nice guy you just met? You're definitely rare. I mean most sisters wouldn't even agree to do something like this. They'd be to worried about messing up their hair or their clothes. I really like the fact that you're open-minded. - Well actually this is a weave, so... (laughs) Just kidding. It's all mine. - Funny, I like that. I don't think the horse does, but funny. - Gosh, she's beautiful. So freeing to do something we don't have to be on point all the time. - You mean you don't always look like this? - Thank you, but that's not what I meant. It's just that being a publicist with the media and the talent always have to be on, you know? I know you know what I mean being a partner at a law firm, right? - Actually I'm not a partner. (mumbles) if you were referring to my business card. The practice has been in our family for over 50 years now. My grandfather actually started it, hence the country club affiliation. From Princeton to South Carolina to Chicago. - That's quite a legacy, jeez. - Blue really has its rewards and its challenges. Mr. Moffin, I think she's ready to go. - You're ready, let's hit the trail. - You're in for the ride of your life, my dear. - (laughs) Better keep me safe. - Oh I got you. - Here you go. - Good job, good job. - Very good, you're all set. - Now go ahead and put your arms around me and scoot forward. You all right back there? - Yes, it's nice. - This here's Shane, and she's my favorite. She's a purebred. She has the best temperament of all of them. - She's beautiful. - Like you. - Thank you. - So I imagine there'll be someone following you here, or at least wishing that he did? - No. - Why not? He'd be a fool not to. - Well we had been dating since college, the relationship wasn't really working out, and when they said my company was moving to Chicago, so did I. We weren't exactly exclusive. - What do you mean by exactly? - [Dennie] It's a long story. - All right, so what is your favorite black romantic movie? - Gotta be Love and Basketball. - Love and Basketball, what about Love Jones? - I used to ball in college. (laughing) - Wow. That sure was a lot of fun, wasn't it? - Yes, my thighs are killing, but it was a lot of fun. - Well just wait until the morning, you're really gonna feel it. - So now that you've dissected my past, you gonna tell me a little bit about yours? - What do you wanna know? - Are you single? - You think I would've invited you here today if I weren't? - Depends what your intentions are. - Well to set the record straight, I'm not in a relationship, engaged, or married. I simply invited you here today because I wanted to get to know the beautiful, smart, new Chi-town sister that I met at the airport. - Fair enough. - I mean my last relationship, with my fiance, ended about a year ago. I loved her, but I was too caught up with firm business. By the time I tried to work things out, it was too late. - Do you regret it? - Sometimes yes, sometimes no. She's actually engaged again and I'm happy for her. I guess at the end of the day I just wasn't ready. (R&B music) (R&B music) - Here you are, love. - Thank you. - I would like to propose a toast. Welcoming you to this great city of Chicago. And to us getting to know each other a little better. - Cheers. - Cheers. So you know anything about this game? - No. Just a little bit. - Well first thing's first, take the stick. Turn around. Now everything starts with a good base, so I want you to open up. Stretch out. Get a good hold of that stick. Wrap your finger around the stick real good, now find the spot that you want to hit, and then thrust into it as hard as you can. Seriously? That's all you got? - Please don't be mean. - Let me show you how to do this thing. - I don't... Oh! - Two, thank you very much. Yeah, now that's how you break. (loud clang) (laughing) So you excited about going home next month? - Yes, my gosh. As much as I love Chicago and spending time with you, I miss everyone. I miss happy hours with Kerra and J and my little brother and Saturday (mumbles) with my mom even though she still calls me every Saturday. - Aren't you the lucky one. You know I'm really gonna miss you when you go. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well maybe all of those beautiful roses you sent me last week will help keep you on my mind? - Hopefully. - Hmm. - You truly are worth all the roses a man can buy. - (laughs) They were quite the surprise. - I would hoping they would be. - Thank you. * When it's (mumbles) sent from above * Tell me have you ever fallen in love - So Dennie, tell us about this Brian guy. - You mean Brian McCormick? - Oh wait. - Is he white?! - No, J, he's black, okay? - Doesn't matter. - Well if he was white, I'd still like him. Golden checklist. - Okay, that's what's good. - He's smart. - That's a check. - Yes, he's attractive. That's two checks. - Okay. - And he's very well established. - Oh good. - That is important. - Yes, and he's just, he's so fun, we're having the best time getting to know each other. - So good to see you smiling. - I know, so why is this catch still single? - What did I do with a catch? - No, listen iisten, he was engaged a year ago for something like nine months or something and it didn't work out 'cause he was too busy with his job and he didn't have enough time for the relationship. - Sounds like you. - Mom, please! (giggling) Anyway, she's engaged to somebody else now and he's happy for her and he says that she wasn't the one for him anyway. - Give it some time, okay? It's true what they say, you will know when it's right. I'm so thankful that Steve and I are where we are now, as you all know what I went through and it's just, when I just think about his commitment to me, but he shows that, he has proven that to me time and again, but you know what really gets us through is that we truly love each other, you know? I'm a little better at this marriage thing than I used to be too, I have to say, but when you're uncertain about things, you're trying to sort out your feelings, girl just pray about that thing, just let it go. God will take care of that. - [Dennie] That's why I was having so much trouble with Damien. He would say that he cared about me, but I would never see that in his actions. Not enough love and not enough respect in the actions, you know? Not like Steve. But Brian, he's, I like him. - I just, as far as Damien goes I think he's like a lot of men. They don't start to show it really until it's too late, they've lost the person that they love, like Brian lost his ex-fiance. - Like Damien lost me. - Has he really? I know you still care about him, Dennie. - No, I mean I live in Chicago now and it's too late. - Yeah. - Let's open up some gifts. - Presents! - Gifts! - 'Cause you know I gotta open up my gift first. - Okay okay okay okay. No offense, but let's go with this one first. - Yes, I got the best one. - Are you sure? - No, (mumbles), I got the best one, girl. You gotta open mine. - Look, Miss Reed, I believe having the two of us join you on this important case will be a tremendous asset for your firm and mine. We're in position to win this. There are around, what, 20? 20 whistleblowers ready to testify against the company. You know they're gonna be looking for a solid legal team to represent them. - [Reed] I wholeheartedly agree, Mr. Jameson. As soon as we get clearance from the other partners in the firm, we'll start litigation. We wanna make sure that we're all in agreement with this legal team arrangement. Expect to hear from me by Wednesday. - So this is your deal. Are we gonna close it? - [Jasmine] Talk about perfect, I just finished meeting with the finest man I've ever met, girl. Hot, Dennie! Hot! Girl, I had to go in the panty bag. - [Dennie] What?! - [Jasmine] Mmmhm. - [Dennis] My gosh, one of those make yo panties wet brothers, huh? - [Jasmine] Make your panties wet? Girl, I had to change them completely. - Ugh, girl. - I will have the honor of working with this man for the next eight months. - Oh God, it couldn't get any perfect than that. - Actually it could. - Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute. Slow it up. We are talking about business, right? - [Jasmine] Yes, yes I am. Secondly I'm saying I'm gonna get that man. (laughing) - So guess who stopped by my house today? - [Jasmine] Who? - Damien. - Really, well I'm not surprised. The man's been calling for you all weekend. Dennie, I'm tired of him calling me to see how you're doing. Dennie, the man flew all the way to Chicago to see you. - Wait a minute, Damien went to Chicago? - Yes. - Well why didn't you tell me? - Dennie, listen, we all know Damien loves you, he just doesn't know how to show it. Yes, I understand you had to move on with your life. I just want you to be happy. Whether it's with Brian, Damien, or whoever makes your happy. You deserve to move on. - He calls all you guys? - Yeah. Now let's eat! I'm billing by the hour, girl, come on! I'm billing by the hour. - She said yes! She said yes! - That was 15 years ago, honey, shhh. Don't get everyone all rattled. - Sweetheart, you have made my world spin. Every day since the day we met here in this café 15 years ago. Thank God your boss sent you down here to (mumbles). I love you with all my heart. You are my true love. Forever and always. - Oh darling, I love you so much you wild sexy man. - You know what? That's what I want. Just not right now though. (gentle acoustic guitar music) - Brian! Hey, what a surprise. - Well you surprised me when you walked into my life. I've been a happy man ever since. These are for you. - Aww, thank you. So sweet. I don't know what to say. - Say you'll have dinner with me tonight. - Yes, absolutely. - Good, 'cause I've really missed you this past weekend and I'm sure you had a good time, I can't wait to hear all about it. I'd be a fool to think that your ex didn't at least try to contact you while you were there. Listen Dennie, I know this is all new to you, so slow me down if you think I'm moving too fast, but I'm not gonna lose another wonderful woman. Perhaps my ex and I just weren't meant to be. I'm not gonna screw up this chance. A chance at being with you. - Awww. - So I'll pick you up around 7:30, we have reservations at eight. - Sounds perfect. - Beautiful. You have yourself a good afternoon. - Thank you, you too. - Bye. - Pst. Girl, you must've whipped it on him. He's so fine. So now you have Brian here and Damien in DC, what are you gonna do with all those men, huh? Give me one. - (laughs) Go away, Chip. - Bye. Music Playing - So you all ready, sweetie? - No, it's freezing. - (chuckles) I apologize, it takes a little while to get used to. But trust me, you'll be warm soon enough. Especially when you eat this food my mother's cooking. - You know Brian, this is my first time away from home on Thanksgiving. - We don't have to go to my parents' house, I can pull out right now. - No, that's not what I meant. I'm perfectly fine, it's just funny how life changes, you know? - I get it. - Yeah? God has a plan for us all. We just have to trust where it leads us. Like here. - Well we're here. - Your parents' house is so beautiful. - How about I go and let you tell them that yourself. Come on. (doorbell rings) - Brian, why are you ringing the bell? - Well mom, we have a guest. - Hi dear, it's so nice to finally meet you. Come on in. - I don't care where you go or how much money black folk have, we still get down on Thanksgiving. Ain't nothing like family. Nothing like family. - Uncle Jacob, it is so nice to meet you. - Girl, stop all that firm stuff, come give me a hug, we're people. We your family this holiday! I'm sure your mama misses you. - Yes she does, but I promised her I'd be home for Christmas. - Hi everybody, we're here, we made it. Brought the turkey for you. I know you couldn't wait, I know you couldn't wait. There she is! - Hey man. - How's everything? (idle chatter) - Can we all, can we all bless the table? - Yes. - Okay, bless the table. Heavenly Father, we come here for you once again to say thank you. Thank you for your grace and thank you for your mercy. And most of all we thank you for each other gathered around this table that we may come before you once again to say thank you. - Thank you. - In these blessings and all others we ask in your precious holy name, Jesus Christ our Lord, amen. - [Group] Amen! - Ready to get down, okay. - Pauline, can you pass me some of that beef? - Now wait a minute, Morris. Here, you have to have some of my homemade cranberry sauce. You know I make it every year. - I suppose I have to. Nobody can eat this dry turkey by itself. - Morris how dare you! - [Morris] Oh come on, Pauline. I'm getting too old to pretend that everything you cook tastes good. But I do still like that pudding pie of yours. - (laughs) Morris, not at the table. - Maybe on the table a little later. - Okay, excuse me, would anyone like a beverage, Dennie? - Yes, I'll take a Sprite please. - Young man, could I have a warm water please? (groans) - Come on, mmhm. Come on, honey, come on. - (mumbles). - Come on, baby, you can do it. - Oh God I can't do it. - Yes you can, come on, sweetie, one more big push, one more big push and you're there. Come on, come on. Ah-ha! (baby crying) All right! Look who we have. Congratulations, Mr. And Mrs. Carter. You have a healthy baby boy. - Oh look at him, he's precious. - Aww, thank you, angel. - We did it. - Yeah, we sure did, yes we did. - I'm so tired. - It's okay, it's okay. - [Jasmine] Kerra? Dennie's on the phone. - Okay. - She's been on the phone this whole time. - Are you serious? - You did it, girl. - Dennie, hey. I wish you were here, he is beautiful. He's a head full of hair and his daddy's nose for sure. Those are my eyes for sure. - [Dennie] Congratulations, Kerra. I know, I wish I was there too, and girl, I heard you pushing. You are a trooper. Kerra Carter, mommy. - I'm a mommy now. (coughs) Dennie, will you be Little Steve's Godmother? - Oh my gosh, yes! You want me to be the Godmother? Oh my gosh, I don't know how to feed a baby, I don't even know how to change a diaper, but I'm gonna go home tonight and I'm gonna research the best schools and I'm gonna get him some more baby clothes. - You're gonna be a great mom someday. (coughs) - Kerra? You okay? (coughs) Listen, I'm gonna let you get some rest, okay? I'll call you a little later on tonight. - Okay. - Don't forget I'll be home for Christmas. I'll see you guys in a couple weeks. - Bye, Brittany. - [Voiceover] Let me check her vitals. - What's wrong? - Her blood pressure's going up. We need to get her stabilized as soon as possible. - What's wrong? - [Voiceover] I need everybody to move now. - [Steve] I said what's wrong! - [Voiceover] Kerra appears to have gone into cardiac arrest. Look, I never everyone, we're gonna do all that we can, I need everyone except you to leave right now. - Hello, can anybody hear me? - Steve, give me the phone. - [Dennie] What's wrong with Kerra? What's happening?! - Give me the phone. - Excuse me. - [Dennie] Hello?! Can anybody hear me?! Hello?! Kerra! Somebody pick up the phone! - Dennie? (sobs) Kerra... Kerra, I don't, I don't know, she just... She was fine and then... Just. God, why? (mumbles) why, God?! - No, no. Tell Kerra I'm coming. Tell her I'm coming. - (sobs) She's dead. She's gone, Dennie. - Oh God. God, she just had a baby, please. She just had a baby, God. (gentle piano music) (gentle piano music) - Hey. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Hey Brian. Great seeing you here. - Good to see you as well. (laughing) - My assistant's scheduling a meeting for next week to talk about the Hoover case. If you've got a moment, I can give you some insight on what we're up against with this one. I'll make it quick before your date returns. - No, no date. So what have you learned about the Hoover case? - Good afternoon, I have a delivery for a Miss Jasmine Dominguez. - [Jasmine] I'm Jasmine Dominguez, J for short. You can leave it by the door, I'll get it. - I apologize for disturbing you, J, but I need your signature. - Sure, what's your name again? - Nathan. - [Jasmine] Nathan. - Horse. - Here you go. - [Nathan] Sure. That's a nice pen you have there. - Thanks. It was a gift. - I'd like to give you a gift. - Excuse me? - I said... I got a lot of gifts to deliver, you know Christmas is a few days away. - Yeah. Thanks again, Nathan. - Would you like to go to dinner sometime? Maybe next week? - I'm just very busy with work, Nathan. I don't have time to go out to dinner. - Okay. Well it's nice meeting you, J. - Thank you, you too. (organ music) - And we're going to invite Steve Carter and Steve Carter Jr to come up at this time. (baby crying) The best friend Jasmine. And the Godparents to come and join in the ceremony. We're also gonna ask Aunt Teresa to come. Certainly we are blessed of the Lord to have this opportunity to offer unto God another child to be blessed by Him. The scripture according to Deuteronomy. Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God. Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might. The bible says hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might. These words I command thee this day shall be in thine heart. Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children. Let us bow our heads for prayer. Kind Father, in the precious name of Jesus we thank You for the opportunity of prayer. You said in Your word men are always to pray and not to faint, and we come at this hour, Lord, just to give You praise, glory, and honor. Have your way, Lord, let Your spirit have free course. Bind us with cords of love that we might continue to do Thy will. In Jesus name, amen. To the parent, do you come professing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of your life? - I do. And do you come to dedicate yourself to biblical instruction, discipline, and love for this child? - I do. - To the congregation, do you as a church agree to support the parent by your example, and through acts of service, and do you agree to reinforce the biblical instruction, discipline, and love of this child under the supreme rule of the Lord Jesus Christ? If so, you may signify by saying we do. - [Group] We do. - Let us pray. Father, in the name of Jesus we thank You for this young life. This soul that we dedicate unto You this day that he might grow up in the admonition and nurture of Your word to become exactly the image of You in the Earth. We ask Your blessings upon his life even now. Use him as Your instrument and Your hand available to Your service that You might get glory, honor, and praise. In Jesus name, amen. - [Group] Amen. - And to the godparents. We charge you that you will be there for support to young Steve and to give him all the nurture and help and support that you can knowing that even though it appears that he has such a loving family, he still needs all the help he can get. And to the friend, and to the aunt, that you also will be a partaker in the instruction and admonition of this life, this child's life as it grows before the Lord. To support the parent in all aspects that you can, and to the church, that you would be mindful of this family to help meet any needs or shortcomings that they might have. That they also would be used by God as you are to bless other lives. You may return to your seats at this time. We're gonna have the children's church from Christ Our Church of God to come and give a selection. (organ music) - I'm proud of you, Dennie. Really. Seeing you in here today, it just... It reminds of why I am in awe of you. I know that I've been bad, I've been crazy, I've been unsettle and immature for so long. Man, I am so sorry. I was young and dumb, right? But I don't know, being in here today, it just make me really... Figure out what's important in life. I hope that the next time that we're standing at the alter will be because you have just walked down the aisle to become my wife. Dennie Marie Lewis, will you marry me? - Oh Damien, I had been waiting for this moment for so long. But for whatever reason, it seemed like our time never came. Or maybe what we had was our time. I will always love you. But I'm in a different place in my life right now. And I can't do this. I'm so sorry. - Dennie. Dennie, please don't walk out of my life. - (sobs) I'm so sorry, Damien. After Kerra and my father, I have to keep moving forward. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey. - [Brian] Hey. So how was your day? - It just got better.
