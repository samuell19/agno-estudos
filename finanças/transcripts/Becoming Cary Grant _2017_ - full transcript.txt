My father was an incredibly smart dresser. He apparently gave Cary -- I should say he gave Archie -- one piece of advice about dressing that Archie and Cary always remembered, which was, if you're only going to have one suit, make it a good suit. My father was a handsome tallish man with a fancy mustache. He earned his money pressing suits for a clothing manufacturer, but progressed in that firm too slowly to satisfy my mother's dreams.

This is the point at which the father went to South Hampton to start his new family, and so he's left there on his own. He remembers being left to fend for himself in an unheated house, being hungry, so this had a terrible impact on him. You can imagine an 11-year-old boy not knowing why his mother had left, where she'd gone, why she hadn't said goodbye, it would be devastating.

I'd played a character called Cary Lockwood on Broadway, so I said, "Why can't I be Cary Lockwood?" But there already was a Lockwood in the business.

My first wife was Virginia Cherrill, the beautiful girl who made such an impression as the blind heroine in Charlie Chaplain's "City Lights." ♪ Cary Grant and Virginia Cherrill went to Bristol in autumn of 1933 for Cary Grant to show Virginia Cherrill where he had grown up. I don't think that he had been back to Bristol, or even to England, throughout the 1920s, and he arrives very much as the film star. They were in limousines.

And we have it open to the page where Archie Leach's mother, Elsie, is being committed. This is the day that she was committed, February the 3rd, 1915. And it has her diagnosis here, that she has a form of insanity called mania, and below that is "facts communicated by others," come from her husband. She's being committed on his testimony alone it seems. So Elias Leach is saying his wife, Elsie, has been queer in her head for some months and thinks that several women are concealed in the house and they put poison in her food. She hears voices through the wall and thinks she's being watched. It says she's not a danger to others, and it says that she's not a danger to herself, and yet she's being put into the asylum, and we know that she's going to stay there for 20 years. When I first came upon the book, I was simply struck by how little was involved in having someone committed; that someone could go into the asylum on the testimony of their husband alone. And there's also something slightly disturbing in that we know that the husband had left Bristol shortly after this and went to South Hampton to live with another woman, and had a child with another woman. He would have been 11 years old when he last saw his mother. When he saw her again, he was 30 years old, maybe 31. There was no indication that she had ever heard of Cary Grant, because the way the meeting has been described, he had to convince her who he was, and she said to him, "Archie, is that really you?" He arranged for her to come out of the hospital, and he set up a fund for her, administered by lawyers in London, so that she would always be taken care of. And he came to see her as often as he could. ♪ Oh, we're going to Wall Street to see Old Man Topper ♪ ♪ Ironbound Topper ♪ ♪ That moss-covered Topper ♪ ♪ I promise to be at this bank at the annual meeting ♪ ♪ Of the board of directors at 10:30 in the morning ♪ Too many words, honey.

I made it. So he becomes an independent, which is very rare at the time. And by making those sorts of individual deals, he's able to choose his roles. Come on. Come on, boy, up. That a boy. So where's momma? And because he's very successful at that, the first two films are his biggest successes, "Topper" and "The Awful Truth" in 1937. Nothing's going to hurt me anymore. ♪ Take it. You wouldn't mind if I looked around? You know, your husband is not like the average American man. He has more the continental mind, yes? Yeah, that's right, I have a continental mind, where you have an eggnog. Oh, thank you. What was different about "The Awful Truth," for him, was that Leo McCarey, a great comic director, shaped his screen persona, told him how to hold himself, helped him develop his comic timing, but also gave him a kind of role model, because Leo McCarey was himself a very handsome, dashing, ladies' man. My, isn't this cozy? It was a screen persona that gave him a starting point as to how to play a carefree, debonair, urbane, modern gentleman. ♪ Gentlemen in movies before this tended to be upper class. They were stuffy. ♪ Cary Grant's screen persona is very democratic, in the sense that you can still hear and see some of working-class Archie in him. Something anyone can aspire to. Air-conditioned. Oh, I -- Oh, so sorry! Oh, hello. You're sitting on your hat. You lied to me. No. Well, I did. Tell me a ridiculous story about a leopard. I didn't tell you a ridiculous story, I have a leopard.

Susan, we settled that question once and for all. But what about my leopard? Hmm, that's your problem. It's not all my problem. Whoa. Susan, Susan? Susan, don't go away, I've got the leopard. ♪ Something happens, I think, in the late '30s and Cukor is a part of it, Leo McCarey, but I think Hawks is the key figure. He senses some kind of fascinating insecurity in Grant that can carry him beyond the sort of genre conventions of attractive male acting. ♪ It's almost as if Hawks, particularly, says to himself, this is a very strange guy. This is not a straightforward American, but Grant is never American. He's not English. He's something else in between, and it's as if he and a few filmmakers saw this and felt a confidence about it and says we can go with this. Who are you? Who are you? Well who are you? What do you want? Well who are you? I don't know. I'm not quite myself today. Well you look perfectly idiotic in those clothes. These aren't my clothes. Well, why are you wearing these clothes? Because I just went gay all of a sudden. It just develops, I think, over the years, and over the many films. And, of course, by now, it's what lies beneath the inescapable but still very unproven and uncertain sense of his own sexuality, because this is clearly a man who appealed to men and women equally on screen. My intercostal clavicle. Your what? My bone, it's rare, it's precious! What did you do with it? The bone? Where did you hide the bone? No David, no, not that way, no. Now, George, we're not angry, no. David and Susan need that bone. It's a nasty old bone. It's hundreds of years old. That's David's bone. I don't know the answer to Grant's own life, but to look back on it now, there's no question that this is a man who is exploring a breakdown of gender safeguards. You know, he's somewhere else. He's placeless. It's just like his social status, his nationality status, you can't pin him down. I think he felt he was there alone on the edge, struggling to survive. Now, of course, by the end, long before the end, people looked at Cary Grant as the epitome of accomplished, sophisticated survival. I'm not sure he felt it though. Would you like to go over to my room? I've got some memories from home, pictures of my father and mother. Pictures of me the first time I went up in the air. Pictures of my first crash.

He's not Cary Grant anymore. ♪ Now it's said that she never wanted to leave Bristol, and that's why she didn't come out and live with him in Hollywood. But there's a sense in which he kept her at a distance.

Thank you, Miss. I'm afraid you're in the wrong compartment, sir. This is a first class compartment, isn't it? Yes, sir. Well, then I'm all right. This is a third class ticket, sir. Hitchcock clearly sees something very different in Cary Grant, and something much darker than the other directors have seen. Now Hitchcock was, himself, a working-class cockney who went to Hollywood and remade himself. So I think he recognized the Archie Leach in Cary Grant more than anyone else. ♪ "Suspicion" begins, seemingly, as a delightful comedy about two glamorous people, Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine. Slowly, you begin to realize there's something else at work here, and he just might be trying to poison her for her money. If you're going to kill somebody, do it simply. Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk? You're right. How would you do it simply? Oh, I don't know, dear. But I'd use the most obvious method. The most important thing is that no one should suspect me. For instance? Arsenic. Ah, arsenic.

Would you mind sleeping in your dressing room? Of course I'd mind. Please, Johnny, I haven't been sleeping very well lately. I understand. The Grant who will appear in "Suspicion," "Notorious," and later on in "North by Northwest," is, I think, an extension of the Grant that Hawks and Grant together found, because I don't think that this was just Grant being told what to do. ♪ I think this was an amazingly intelligent actor, and a desperately insecure man who had to find a self, finding that self. Feel better? What do you care how I feel? In "Notorious," he's a character who is incredibly suspicious, jealous, and resentful of the woman he's in love with, and he will allow her to go through any kind of danger and hardship, ostensibly for her job as a spy. Do you want me to take the job? You're answering for yourself. I'm asking you. It's up to you. It seems to be exploring the idea that he is just very emotionally damaged, unreachable almost. That you believe I'm nice and that I love you and I'll never change back. I'm waiting for your answer. And you never quite know where you were. You never know how far this quality of danger is going to come out. It doesn't ruin the likability, but it qualifies it all the time. It's very hard to think of another actor of that time in an American film playing a male lead who would come on as tough and cold, and I think he grasped it effortlessly. ♪ Joe!

He plays a man who is a failure. He can't support the child he's adopted, so he risks losing the child. And yet, he's desperate with love for both the wife and particularly the child. What a grip... for a girl, I mean. There's a scene where he goes to the adoption agency and really pleads for them to continue custody of this child they've adopted. Children never meant a great deal to me. Oh, I liked them all right, I suppose, but what I'm trying to say is, Your Honor, the first time I saw her she looked so little and helpless. I didn't know babies were so little. It's anguished, it's agonized. It certainly revealed something about what Grant must have felt about wanting a child, because it's really an amazing scene in a way.

And for Hitchcock, it's a film, I think, about a reckless, irresponsible man who becomes attached. ♪ There is a real moral core to that film, and Grant, I think, understands it totally and does it most beautifully.

I mean, he hated, for example, having to get up and make a speech, absolutely hated it. He wouldn't eat beforehand. He would be terribly, terribly nervous. That's why he loved the "Conversations with Cary Grant," because someone was asking him a question. He started the whole evening by showing clips of many films where backflips were done and various other things were done, and then he would tell a joke, and then people will ask him questions. And so it was a format that he came up with and loved. Cary always used to have a rehearsal, and he always wanted me sitting in the audience so that I could say, "I can't hear you, can hear you," or whatever. And I was sitting in the audience and he was going through the lighting and going through everything else, and then his voice became a little bit flustered. His mind became a little bit flustered, and he beckoned for me to come on stage. So I went up to him, and he asked me just to hold him tight because he wasn't feeling very well.
