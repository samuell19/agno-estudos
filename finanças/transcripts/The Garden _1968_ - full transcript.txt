The radio said there will be many hares this summer. They'll wreak havoc, mate. You can't imagine how much damage a hare can do. If one gets into your garden in winter... Want some? The young trees suffer the most from hares. Oh, hold on. Don't fall out. When a hare gnaws a young tree, it's completely destroyed. THE GARDEN Concept and dialogue Dramaturge Starring: Also starring: Sound: Costumes: Assistant director: Production manager: Editor: Cameraman: Screenplay, Director: Come on, then. We'll be there soon. Boy, you haven't changed at all in 20 years. Mary will be pleased to see you. We've arrived. Frank! Come and have a look at this. You've seen nothing like it. What a pair: Real thoroughbreds. See the lovely fur? Marvellous. She'll have a litter soon. Rabbits are my passi?n. Do you mind? What are we going to do with you, Boruvka? You tell me. What are we going to do with you? I simply don't understand. Instead of standing in for two people, now that Mr. Mak?nek... ...Mr. Mak?nek has passed on, you sit down at night, perhaps even take a nap. Now, tell me, what are we going to do with you? Give me another chance. Joseph! I've brought a guest for you. That's Mary. I'll introduce you. I'll let you off this once, Boruvka. So this is my Mary. This is Frank, Mary. He's the one... well, you know, from Hradec. I apologise. Joseph's told me so much about you. Go and make us some coffee. I'll show Frank something. You see, I'm a man of the land. Do you know what is most important in a garden? Please hold this for me. No, seriously. Try to guess. You give up? Come here. A layer of earth, a layer of manure... And a layer of earth. Joseph, who are those people? What? Oh, that? That's my living fence. Good fertilizer is... They just stand like that? Yes, like that. The most important, if you want good fruit... - Voluntarily? - Voluntarily. Trees must have what they need. But why? Dammit, Frank, I'm trying to explain. Compost... Don't treat me like a fool. Why do they stand there? How can I explain, Frank? Simply because... For example, that man in the coat. Well, he... Or that one there... And the next one... Well? It's more or less the same with them all. How beautiful, to see people stand like that. Holding hands... in the fresh air. There's something about a living fence, I'll tell you. There's something real about it, live. But, in order for the fence to be good, you have to prune it now and then. It must be cultivated, like everything. I have a system. Plant an engineer between two butchers, or vice versa. Everything must be done with care. And then, there's nothing to equal the feeling. Coffee! Frank... Mary, bring the coffee here. We'll drink it in the fresh air. A production of Kr?tk? Film Prague 1968 Documentary film Barrandov Film Studios
