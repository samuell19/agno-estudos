What's this? God gave our two families to get respected by people. He tortured people with that ego. I warned him no to do it. He didn't listen. So I killed him. Will you kill my son for the sake of poor coolies? You're wrong, we're not different from people, life is same to all, such incidents mustn't happen in future. It'll happen, what will you do man? Enmity developed with this incident, two friendly royal families turned into sworn enemies, not a day passes without any clashes between them, not a day passes without a death on either side, laws changed, generations changed, though there have been many changes, enmity is still simmering like a bier. Raja Ranganayakulu, relative of two warring families who had seen much bloodshed, tried to make peace between them. I request both families to think over it with open heart! Enmity that started decades ago is still raging between you, already thousands of lives have been lost, and still losing, people are afraid to offer their daughters in marriage to this region, - no one here is living peacefully. - So what? You can seek vengeance, but not every day! After the harvest, the two days of festivities of Goddess Palalamma during Sankranthi, are all yours! Police will not come and there won't be any cases, whose home will mourn death, whose house will celebrate Bhogi, decide that in those two days! One who wins will rule the entire year. Till next festival nobody mustn't incite or attack each other. This is a good idea for people to live in peace, MP.- I agree! Who are you to lay rules and who are they to agree? Aren't two days more than enough to kill this family? I too agree. Two days prior to the festival, exchange betel leaves here. Those who disagree can avoid coming here. If one anyone fails to turn up, it means accepting the authority of other clan. It's a promise on your family which stands by it's word. Nobody must break the rule. According to that decision, ever since then in all the festivals, Vasireddy family continues to win. People were happy. But losing a family member to it every year, now there's only one Vasireddy Veerasimha. I'm coming to exchange betel leaves, priest. Though enemies have lost, they've gained in strength, you've lost everyone and become lonely, God has given you three daughters but no male heir. I'm scared what would they do with people here after you. Sir, madam has delivered in hospital This family has a heir now, sir! God has blessed! He would become a great man! Father-in-law! Where's the child? He was born dead. Long live! Happiness of having a heir didn't last till father sees his son. Fate, my son-in-law! - Does Vasundhara know this? - No, son-in-law. God given heir! Supersonic missile sent by God to people who think I'm the last! From this day you must also forget him along with me. I'll turn him into a weapon to run shiver down the spine of my enemies, and present him proudly before you after 25 years. - I want your blessings. - Long live Prince! - Bury him, father-in-law. - Why did you say like that, son-in-law? What am I to do? I've to keep courage alive in people's hearts. And keep the enemies at bay! To keep love alive in mother's heart, we, who know the truth must die a death every minute. Where will the heir come from? After me, to protect my people, though he's not my son, God will send someone! Till then we've to fight! Bury him! He went to battle with grief and lost that year. You celebrated when my family member died, you celebrated the arrival of heir in his family, right? From today nobody must have a male child. If at all born, it must be in my family only! After 25 years, if his heir comes as you expect, no man should be here to support him or fight with him. If you defy my order and have a male child, I'll kill! No man will come to bring down this flag or hoist another flag, Won't come! I'll not allow to come. 25 years later... Krishnamohan, if you want to continue your business or live, you must pay me what ever I ask, first time in my career, you've made me call you 5 times. First time I've replied to you 5 times. Your demand is not right. It's not my mistake to become a big industrialist. Cut the call. Sir, please don't get down. Sir, they're after my life, please save me. Sir, they're after my life, please save me. If they kill you, die! Do you want us also to die? - No sir... - Can't you understand? In this world where life has no value, death is better than life. Kill me! What bothers you if I kill him? Kill? Kill him? Who are you to kill? Wipe it. Brother, money is for basic needs like eat, live and sleep. Not to die or kill others. I'm talking to him! Won't you listen? Where is he? Job is done. Got the stick of life.- He got it right. - You're fine, aren't you sir? - I'm fine. Thanks sunny. - How much will it sell for? - What? - Market value of your thanks. - I got it, how much you want? By mistake, take it if you had died, just think if you were dead, there would be heavy expenditure on cremation, last rites and donations. Now you've saved all that, right? Give me what you'd saved, sir. Your logic is good. For my level it would be around Rs.10 lakhs. What if anything had happened to you in the fight? Sir, God has given me this life and guts to save people. The satisfaction of saving a life even after giving life, that's enough sir! Even if I die in this process, there's no one to mourn for me. I'm an orphan! You've the quality! You're convincing in any matter. You're fast too! If you enter politics, you'll rock! It's decided up there, fate is here, lines are here, the guts to fulfill it is here! I'll not enter because I want something. But if people call me, I'll not stop! Party? You? Rs.2000? Not worth a penny too. I didn't want to fall in love before my bank balance is Rs.50 lakhs. Decided not to marry till it is Rs.60 lakhs. In such a situation, I've suddenly made Rs.25 lakhs in a risky fight, now my bank balance has risen to Rs.63 lakhs! Every month minimum interest is Rs.30000. My wife can live luxuriously with it. So, I'll find a good girl for myself, make her fall in love with me, marry her, and live happily with her family name So, urgently find a girl... Bloody! How dare you hit a Rs.63 lakh worth rich man! I'll dent your dicky today! You're finished! Dicky is interesting! Oh God! She's going away! What a handsome man! Who is he? He's feeling so much watching you. Yesterday gave him a little jerk with car he ran up five floors for me, looks like he'll not leave me, what shall we do now? Nothing, let's take him for shopping and swipe his card few times, not only with any other girl, he'll not shop with his wife too. Brother-in-law, they're in the process of swindling you. You'll get real jolt! Look at that fool there! He was wheatish complexion earlier, they swindled and made him fair! People may steal money from God they can't even touch money in my account. - Is it? - Yes. - Why are we discussing about him? - Hey you! Come here. - Me? - If not you am I calling the fool next to you? Fool? - Why did you call me? - Won't spare the girl if you see? It's not our fault, how is the girl? How is her hair? Which colour lipstick she's using? What clothes she's wearing? How does she appear from top to bottom? We think up to that only. But what about you? - Aren't you scanning his whole body? - What's your problem? Will you follow if I hit you once? You hit me only once, but it hurt me here. - I'm tensed when this will go burst. - Are you mad? Mad... you'll never encourage, right? There are four other with you now, I'll leave her, other three are good like you, right? It got hurt on seeing you not them, why? Try to understand me. If you follow me, I'll cut it. Will you cut? Never seen anywhere... ample endowments... Though befriended still makes one go crazy... Bunches of pumpkins... O lily, my chubby cheeks darling... My dear... you're gentler than a doe... You're silly... smile my dear... Don't go away pinching me... Watching your stunning beauty created chaos in my heart... Seeing your sensational tiny waist has plunged me into eternal intoxication... You ripped me with your top angle... You created chaos in me with your low angle... You killed me with your side angle... You made me squeal with your back angle... You're an angel in any angle... You've shown a new angle to my life... Fire of passion has leapt in me on seeing you... Watching your razor sharp eyes are inciting passions in me... You chewed my brain with your blue jean... You incited me with your red jacket... You've washed me with your violet tattoo... You've dried me with your orange scarf... You've made me crazy with myriad of colours... You've filled my dreams with billion colours... You've made me think who your parents are... You've raised passions in mind... - Hey stop... stop! - I've all the papers, sir. But your constable is asking money, sir. Go! Pay the fine. Don't smile. Smile is green signal. If you've any feelings, crush it inside. If you show it, he won't follow, he'll ride on you. - No, he'll crush you. - No, he'll cheat you. - Sir, need to go urgently sir... - Move! - Take him to the hospital urgently. - Where will you go man? - Please listen to me. - Won't you stop if I order? Let him go to the hospital. He may die, sir. Let him die! You take him to the hospital. Wrong! It's wrong to wish other man's death. Sir, I beat him because he said let him die. No sir... Saying please after beating a policeman. Are you police? What was his crime? He saved a dying man. How dare you beat police! Nobody in this world can save you now! Know before with whom you're picking up a fight! Central Home Minister's man, you're suspended. - Meet me in my office. - Sorry, it happened unwittingly. Please don't take it to your heart. Who is he? State Home Minister coming personally to suspend me. No sir, he's an orphan. Not an orphan, there's something behind him. I may look like a rogue but I'm a good man. Trust me. - When shall we marry? - So quickly? Let's enjoy love for few more days. Enjoy means sending hundreds of SMS's and phone calls, did you eat anything? If so what did you eat? Which dress are you wearing? Nighty or any other dress? If sleeping, are you sleeping down or facing up? How do you feel? All this nonsense would not suit for my body language, marry happily, bring into the world a dozen children continuously, and create a wonderful family! It'll be amazing! What do you say? - A dozen? Continuously? - Yes. You can but first tell me about your back ground.- Background? - I've Rs.63 lakhs in my bank account. - Do you know who am I? I'm daughter of MGM constructions Peddi Rama Rao. Our property is Rs.6000 crores. Home Minister was here on getting my dad's call.- Rs.6000 crores? It means Rs.63 lakhs and 6000 crores! Figure is good! I like you. But my father must like your family. Family? Why my family? My father checks the pedigree of a dog at least 7 generations to buy it. Guarding dogs may need records but why for a son-in-law? Do you've a family or not? If you don't have, then forget me. Should I forget her? I didn't want to tell my background and make you fall in love with me, if I tell my family's surname, entire state would go crazy with adulation. - Are you from royal family? - Did you feel like that? - Yes, royal family! - Then, talk to your people and call me. Okay. Royal family? Good! Boast! To hell with your boasting nature! No surname and you claim to be from royal family. Where am I to find them? Sudha, you go inside. We told you not to have any male child to support that family. But if you'd a male child, it means you're not scared, right? Sir, it's not a male child but female child. Baby girl... girl...- Girl? - You should've told me, right? - Brother, it's a boy! Sir, I made a mistake. Please forgive us.- Kill it. Made a mistake, sir. I beg you sir, please spare my child. What a horrible life, God! You'll pay for your sins! Curses of so many mothers would surely take it's toll. Do you why we are still alive despite so many tortures? To see your death! The man to kill will come, heir to that family will come. - What happened? - I came to know about a thing. Royal family of Veeradurgam is trying to adopt a young man, a man who is good in many things, an orphan without any relations, they're trying to adopt such a man secretly. Where are they now, brother-in-law? - Bend. - What's that sir? Kings don't generally accept ordinary greetings. Bow and greet me. - Greetings sir. - Who is the candidate? He's the candidate. I thought he would be gigantic but he's too small built. As if he's very tall! If you've anything in heart, make an expression don't say in words. - Should I be afraid of him also? - Sir, he's little loud mouth! Acting too much! He'll get it for that! - Sir, he's King of Veeradurgam. - Greetings sir. Tell me your name now. Surname?- What do you mean by 'N'? Tell your full name. 'N' means Nene (myself) - You mean! - Nil, I mean zero! Why would I come to you if I had a home and surname? To tell you frankly, I don't have anyone other than a lover. What are you expecting from this adoption? If I say mother, I know about people throwing alms at me, but I don't know how a mother's cooking would be! I've a habit to pray that every home must be happy, but there's not a man in this world to give little place in his home. If anyone is in danger, I feel like saving him at the risk of my life, but if anything happens to me, there's no one to mourn also. Now you've come like a God, I'll give you a father, mother, a beautiful family and an address to tell everyone, Son, unable to see a mother's anguish, unable to kill the hope of people, though the child died at birth, your father has made every one to believe the child is alive, you're entering as that child, you must make your father's word come true, and you must kill here the truth that you were adopted. Take oath on God to keep this promise. In the witness of fire, I'm your family's heir. Heir to your kingdom. All citizens there are my people. I'll keep your word and hope. From today your name is Raja Vasireddy Vijayadwaja Srisimha! He's feeling happy for getting a grandson, he doesn't know you're a human bomb. Though we know you, we don't understand you, how can they? No need for anyone to understand, it's enough if our job is done. Will you swipe them like a credit card? - Prince! - Grandpa! - Call with respect. - Grandfather, tell me. He's my heir and will look after everything. Bill is Rs.2.5 lakhs, add tip of Rs.50000 and pay it. - Rs.3 lakhs! - Bye. Prince should never get startled. Your hand should always be on top! Pay the bill. It seems my hand must be on top. - They've washed me down. - Front or back? You talked about treasures and big money, but they've washed me off for Rs.3 lakhs, you fool! You thought he was an item bomb but he's an atom bomb. My foot bomb! Tell me what should I do now? - Pay Rs.3 lakhs. - 3 lakhs! They've big palaces. They'll pay you there and your life will be settled. Do they really have palaces? They stole Rs.3 lakhs from me, they've shaved me clean. Is there any palace or not? Prince, please stop the car. This is the arch to enter our kingdom. Whose arch is that one? Father! To announce that there's no one to challenge our authority, your statue would be taken in procession during the festival, how is my idea? - Tasteless! - What do you find lacking, sir? Pride! Fort of Veeradurgam must be under my feet, my hand must carry the head of Vasireddy family's heir, people must wet their dresses in fear after seeing my statue. Change it! They've brought home their heir, sir. Heir stepping in there and our home getting burnt... They've brought him at right time for the festival. Prince is here! Bury him! - I'm telling you, he's the prince! - Greetings! Why are the horses too look at me suspiciously like him? - Do they know I'm duplicate? - Animals, right? Very intelligent. Yes, you know better about your ilk, how would we know? Well said, buddy. - Brother-in-law! - Who is he? What a handsome man you're! You're combination of Karna and Arjuna. Palace was dull colourless for 25 years, Got it painted for your arrival. How is it? Enemy? You're too much! He's your elder sister's future husband. Entire family is waiting for you, let's go in, brother-in-law. Your sisters! Middle one holding the plate is your eldest sister. - Isn't she beautiful? - Indeed but you talk too much. - I got aged waiting for your arrival. - If I had not come? I would grow old as bachelor. Come in brother. Prince! Your mother! Please take her blessings. Our family Goddess is there, seek her blessings first. Son! - Why are you standing and eating? - That's my habit, brother-in-law. - We stand and eat near push carts. - Push carts? Traditions are different there and here. That place is waiting 25 years for your arrival. This is not new to us, brother. We used to offer the first morsel to you and then only eat. Ever since we know how is our brother, Where is he? What is he doing? Has he eaten or not? How many troubles he's facing living lonely there? Not a day passes without thinking about you, brother. Brother, we think so much about you here, there's a home here, you've a mother in home, aunts too, and 3 elder sisters, how are they? Are they alive or dead? Didn't you ever feel like seeing them? We cried... when will you come and when would we see you? We cried everyday for you. He used to feel sad more than you. I stopped him for the right time. Now it has come. Prince, you take rest. - Why are you sitting dull, buddy? - I think we're doing wrong. - What's wrong in it? - It's wrong. How much affection they're showering as their son and brother! But I've come here with a selfish motive. The day they come to know I'm not their real heir. What would become of them? Why would you go away or cheat them? Forget it. Your In-laws have Rs.6000 crores! Your account has Rs.63 lakhs! And in this house! Forts, horses, swords, daggers and treasures! You're not an ordinary man but an emperor. Though there are so many emperors, he's different... One and only great warrior... Poetry, painting, music, sculpture, drama, art of interpreting body marks, Exorcism, power of attraction, hostility... Expert in using fire, air and wind power... Expert and new... He's an expert in sword fight, mace and archery... He's great... greatest of the greats... Greatest among people... ruler! Mighty majestic warrior... King of kings... Emperor of the worlds... The only shining light in the history of the world... The one and only man whose flag of acclaim is fluttering high... War is yours, fame is yours, you rule over the entire universe... I'll kill with my bare hands even marauding beasts... I'll crush with my feet even raging fires coming from behind... That's why I'm offering my beauty to you... Yearning that you get me... You've the speed of lightning... You've the epitome of courage and bravery... The game is yours, hunt is yours, you rule over the entire universe... Look at him friends! Wiping out the class differences... See everyone as equal... Giving up affiliation to family and caste... Be just and equal to everyone... That's why I'm offering half of my life to you... I'll become full with your love... Your victories make even highest peaks to bow before you... You're lightning that can light up skies... Justice is you, fame is your, you rule over the entire universe... Goddess is speaking! Lord good times are ahead. - Good, he's playing it well, right? - Finishing would be better. Pride in body and luminance in eyes, generous and thinking man. - He knows about me. - You give charity and we bless you. My life is blessed and lord will be generous today. - Prince, give him a lakh! Lakh? - Got worried? Lakh for a beggar? You're a royal, what ever you do, it must be big! May God bless you sir! Be blessed with happiness! You got it back, right? Do blessings come free? Hail Lord Hari, the resident of heaven! - Hail Lord Ranganatha! He'll bless with riches! - Blow holes to our pocket. Hail Lord Govinda! - Prince, give him also a lakh. - A lakh again... Won't he say anything less than a lakh? If Haridas praises to the hilt, you must be more generous than him. Never give up pride as a royal, always be generous.- I will! You said there would be crowns, swords and treasures. You called me emperor and ruler, I feel like I'm getting shoved with a rod! - Tell prince about his birthday. - Okay. Birthday? Brother-in-aw, day after tomorrow is your birthday. Buy one rupee chocolates and distribute it to everyone. Just chocolates? Ours is a royal family and first time you're celebrating it in person. It must be so grand that its talked about for generations. Talked about for generations? How grand should it be, brother-in-law? There are 40 villages depending on us, say a lakh for a village would be just Rs.40 lakhs only. - Oh God! That's all! - That's all! Did you hear it? Just Rs.40 lakhs only! Let's spend it, okay. Not only that another Rs.5 lakhs for painting this palace. Did you hear this? This is great, Rs.5 lakhs! Good fitting! - It's painting not fitting, brother-in-law. - Yes, colours, paint me! Painted it already! Brother-in-law, these old cars not good to go around. - Let's buy a good big car! - Big car it seems, let's buy that also. They're taking liberty to clean us with rights. Don't know what's this strange! Why are they shouting? I should be shouting, right? May be hungry and shouting for feed.- If you give Rs.50000... Why not feed me? Sorry, horses are vegetarians, they don't eat non-vegetarian food. Good... good... Let's go inside.- Me? Please come in. Neither I want your home nor your family name. My surname is Nil... nil... Buddy, they've taken everything I had in bank, they've shaven me clean, left at least this, let's live twirling it. Comedy for onlookers and painful for us. Let's escape from here, buddy! How come prince dropped his baggage? How did she come here? How did she come to know it? Greetings sir. My daughter. Greetings sir. Oh no before you! We can buy anything with money but not respect. Useless money! If he stays here, they'll wash him also clean. They cleaned off Rs.63 lakhs in 6 days. We were left with at least moustache, poor man hasn't got moustache also. Look at him! - But he has Rs.6000 crores, right? - Let it be anything! This will be the end. They said lakh for us and crore for him. After that his daughter would become cook here and I'll be the gardener. He'll become cleaner and you'll clean cattle sheds. It's fixed. I'll leave my daughter here, not just for namesake, entire family must accept her cordially, till then don't tell anyone about their love. I'll take leave. Greetings madam. My daughter. - Our younger brother Vijayadwaja Srisimha. - Greetings sir. Isn't she very beautiful? She made an entry and locked me out. All my 63 lakhs are gone, what am I left with now? Life! Do we need so many swords for one life? He may be alone but that clan's heir are great warriors, every drop of their blood is a dagger. - Priest! - Sir! Invite them for exchange of betel leaves. Earth is seeking sacrifice! Greetings sir! Where is he? Where is my nephew? - Only nephew is warrior... - Who is this drama artiste? Not an artiste but your maternal uncle. He'll cut his throat for your family! Poor man lost his eyes but he's a good lover of arts.- Nephew... - Uncle, your nephew is here. Where? - He's here.-Here... here... King must be like this! I've brought you a gift, nephew. Dear Neelaveni, your suitor is here, come dear. Oh no, I'm feeling shy, father. You yearn to see him, but feel shy to meet him. If you do like this he'll go back to city.- No please! - She hardly speaks. - This side.. You must talk for her too. Talk to her. He will be coming from city and would be very stylish, well educated, must be perfect, fit and decent, if not he may mistake me for lose character, and advised me to maintain shyness, so said my father. Did I maintain it perfectly? Not only that, what ever you say, I must only make gestures and expressions, and should never talk too much, you may mistake me for loose tongue, so said my father. Did I say anything loose? My father says if given a chance I'll override people. - Did you feel am I overriding you? - No. Though men are close relatives, he told me not to rub shoulders with them. Did you feel am I moving too close with you? Oh! I thought our guy is loud mouth. He's nothing compared to her. I've a small doubt. I thought a prince would be tall like a pillar. Why are you so small built? He may be small in built but extremely powerful! Don't think I'm doing over, are you a good swordsman? He hasn't yet begun it. When times comes, he'll use it vigorously. I'm here for you only. If you need anything, just say Neela.- How? - Say Neela and I'll appear! - Okay. Use me well. What's this? Daddy bought it for our engagement. With this half of our marriage is over. What?- You said half marriage is over. Let's commit 50%. Mother promise! I'll not go any further. Can't you wait till marriage? What's the problem in our marriage? I've found a good family, right? - Found? - Tongue slip! I wanted to say born into a good family but said found. - Forget all that... - Who is that? Who is he? He's my uncle and blind, you keep quiet. - Teach me the devotion... - Nephew! Are you praying? Like uncle like nephew! Very devoted! - Carry on. - Devotion... devotion... Why have you stopped with devotion? Why don't you go further? Go! I've permission till that only, uncle. I mustn't go beyond that. - Permission for devotion too. - Why is she coming now? Nephew is ecstatic in devotion. It's sin to stop midway. - Yes... yes... - We'll offer prayers together, father. - You go. - Go ahead, dear. My friends said men get tempted listening anklets sound. Is it really tempting? This place is vacant, right? No lover? So lover. My friends said life of the man who marries me would a big festival. It's a festival, right? - What's this? Booking! - Booking? My father made it for engagement. Is it fitting perfectly? If I put it on your hand, half of our marriage is over. It seems I can co-operate 50%. May I?- Do! - Can't bear it, I'm a kid! - How can you be a kid? You're capable of having dozen children continuously after marriage. I think you're very shy. After your shyness decreases, just call Neela, I'll be here. Use me! - Think over it once again. - What man? She says booking! She says co-operation! She says use me! What's your story? No tale or story, she has good figure but very weak in this matter. - But you're very strong, right? - Oh God! Me? Yes, you! Shut up! A dozen kids! With how many girls these kids? I'll cut it. - Says figure is good! - Will she cut it? That girl says use me. No use to wait anymore, I must show my power to them. You've guts... I'm amply endowed... Let's unite courage and beauty to rock the world.. You've guts... trust me it suits me... We've hit it together with kisses... On the left, it's jammy... on the right it's whammy... Taking on them is knock-out... I'll give my hand, take it... I'll give my cheeks, smear it... - I'll give my waist, have it... - Use me... Use only me... Accept if given the principle... Enjoy if given the interest... Bite my cheek... Use me... Use me also... My hunger is only one but there are two banana leaves... The night is only one but there are two beds.. If both join together and I get into mood, it's shattering... My youth is here, have it... The game is open, play it... My back is open, slide over it... Hot side dish is there, taste it... I'm there, have me... Though there are two flutes, there's only on flautist to play... Though there are two percussions, there's only one musician to play... Whether it's two or three or any number, the sound of fun is one... - Use me! - I'll cut it. - Use me please! - Get lost! Sir, auspicious time is fixed tomorrow to accept betel leaves. Then...- Prince! Tell them we'd come tomorrow morning to temple to accept it. I'll come to the temple tomorrow morning to accept it. May you blessed with long life! - Lord! - Show around the place to prince. Come brother-in-law, let's go around the place.- Go alone. Should I go alone? Why in a carriage? We've a Benz car, right? Go in the horse carriage. Turn back! - Who is he? - That's family's heir, sir. Why did he come here? Lord, twirl your moustache and thump your thigh. Thump my thigh? Why? That's the way your two families greet each other. What sort of greeting is this? The sound of your thigh must make them shiver in fear. - The weak hearts must cease. - Do it lord! I'll do it, don't get excited! Tomorrow we've a meeting, right? Dying candle burns brightest! Let's put it off. Give it to son. He came home and challenged us. You must behead him. Exchanging betel leaves to kill each other. You were hidden for 25 years and brought up secretly for this day. People here are waiting for this day. Family is waiting for this day. Your enemy too is waiting for this day only. My father was killed in these clashes, fearing they would kill me, I wore skirts like a girl. I was guarding this home in different get ups till you came. To change our lives, you've to enter the arena, brother-in-law. - No brother-in-law... - This is not just his wish. Mine too. They gouged out my dad's eyes. When you kill them though he may not see with his eyes, my father has come here to listen at least their death cries. His thoughts must always be on the enemies. To keep it away from straying, my dad says it's not wrong to sleep with him also. To put an end to their sins, you must take on them. Just a minute! You don't get tensed watching this. I lied to you, I'm not their son. To get your love, I got myself adopted by this family. It was me who brought you here. What? Yes, you're compassionate about other's lives. Entire place is bearing tyranny. Your brother-in-law is proud to say about losing his father, Neelaveni says proudly about her father losing his eyes, but my father ran away in fear, you know that? He made billions but still ashamed to enter this house, he stood outside, you saw him, right? I got an opportunity to correct it in your form. I'm not saying I don't love you. Or I want you dead. I'm mad about you. If anything happens to you in the fight, I'll join you in death. You must accept the betel leaves by dawn in temple. I've seen people accepting betel leaves for marriages and auspicious functions. What's this accepting it for killing each other? All have joined and planned to sacrifice my life. It seems kingdoms were lost for women, bloody kingdoms! I lost Rs.63 lakhs. They washed me clean like fish. You added fuel to this fiery plan, right? You... You were itching for this with your loud and loose tongue. I got you into this mess. Is it my mistake? But one thing is true, they have great hope on you!- Don't I've it? Mother, sisters... a good family! It's hard for me also to leave them. But what's this killing? They didn't kill for 25 years because they had no heir, right? - If I leave now, this will end, right? - Are you leaving them permanently? No, they'll fight for two days only, right? Let's vanish for two days only, there won't be any trouble. Let's come back after the festival. What would they say? They'd say I ran away! They may call me a coward and lost. I don't mind them abusing me. But they'll be happy, right? That's enough for me. Come. Priest! Why hasn't he come to accept the challenge? Got scared of us? Has he lost his manliness? If he hasn't come it means he has accepted defeat. You went to his home and blessed him with long life, it means you want us dead, right? The day he came to my home and challenged me, his body belongs to me. Though he surrenders, I want his body to be cut into pieces. Go! Go bring that entire family here. Ensure no other man touches the women of that family, only we must touch them. How dare! Will you bring him to my home and have him challenge me? What are those shouts? Tie him to the horse and drive it. Who has dared to attack us? - Father! - This is unjust, sir. You said their family heir would come even your children are dead. Where is he? Has he run away? Why are you rushing? If a lion steps back, it is to jump and bite the neck. He'll come! Tell him to come. Thank God, we left a big war. No! O brave mother! How could you give birth to a coward? Did you give him birth legally or illegally? If you want to save your daughters' honour and lives of your people, you must come out. Fall at my feet with tears and say you gave birth to a coward. Will you come out or see people die? We've legs for you to fall at and crush you down. Come! Brother! Grandpa, take mother and sisters inside. Till now I had used my hand for necessity only. If I use it for a purpose, you know how it would be? Is my body yours? Won't you leave even after death? Lord Brahma gives life and takes it away! Don't know what one would become, a lord, or king or your father, who the hell are you to change the fate written by Lord Brahma? You're talking without knowing about me or history of this region. One who creates history won't come announcing, he takes birth from the courage of heart, he stands, he'll start, and goes back only after creating history! If I beat like this for what is not mine, if I take this place is mine and that family is mine, and the problems of these are mine and hit you, sacrifice, Male child would fear to take birth in your family for next ten generations. I swear on that land I'm standing, I swear on the wind touching me, I swear on this family and these people who trust me, I'm standing... I'll take on you, I'll not let your flag fly in this region, I'll not let anyone to lose life here. Don't stir me! No danger to life but would take years to recover. - Does he need such a life? - Isn't it luck that our son is alive? If women of the house dare to speak, that's enough! That's enough to tell what we've lost! He didn't accept the challenge, he didn't enter the arena, he didn't unsheathe sword or take lives, but he won and people celebrated it, and scholars sang in his praise! He's there and we're here! Is it necessary for him to live? Shut up! Were you born in a royal family or in a Harlem? Don't cremate or offer last rites, think a dog has died in the house, throw out the body! We must make him enter the arena on the 14th day from today. We must behead him before the same crowd that hailed him. Play the band! King has arrived... Prince has arrived... Brought festivities along with him... Spreading moonlight in every home... His Highness King Vasireddy... Your whistle is cracking like opening Andhra soda bottle... Your hearts are my throne... Your affection is my crown... Your blessings are my wealth... Your camaraderie is my fame... When you're with me as my strength... I'm the Emperor of Kingdom of Happiness... Taraka Simha is the ancestor of Vasireddy royalty... Vikrama Simha is his son and Pratapa Simha is his son... Surya Simha is his heir... Rudra Simha is his son... Veera Simha is his son... His heir is Srisimha of Vasireddy royals, who has arrived now... I'm a grandson wished by grandfather-... I'm brother of sisters' wish... You're the life of all of us here... Everyone is here for one man... I'm dedicating all my next 7 births to your service... They're near by landlords, your supporters, brother-in-law. Tell me. We've been a dishonoured life for 25 long years, sir. After years you've made the enemy to run on the day of challenge. You challenge them, we're behind you, we don't mind giving life also. Then, do one thing, burn down your crop! - Raze down your homes. - How can we eat if we burn the crop? Where can we live if we raze down homes? Why would a dying man need food and home? You love on crops for which you've worked for 6 months only, and love the home which you built, but you don't care about the life which God has blessed you with, why? Is pride more important that life? If man goes on killing each other, there won't be any men left, The word people would be no more. The world will be left with void. Don't create void for your revenge. Hereafter no more challenges and fights in this region. Live your life on your own! Your thought is good and we too want to live, - but our enemies won't let us. - Your father lost, they're killing every male child born here to deny you support, we sent 2000 people away from here, but he searched and killed them, don't know how many are still alive, do we've to live this horrible life even after your arrival? No need! I know the horrible life of loneliness. Hereafter no eye should ever shed a tear. No home would mourn a violent death. It's my responsibility to unite warring groups! Trust me. Father! Is he really my son? What's new in this? It's been going for 70 years now. Moreover they celebrate it like a festival. They want police there and no cases should be booked. You make your own rules and follow it, right? It's not a constitution written by scholars to follow it, it's not even a tradition from our Vedas, sir. As the district Collector it's your responsibility to stop the clashes. For that people have to accept it, right? Why wouldn't they, sir? When gram is sold for Rs.100 a kilo and worm infested rice is given for Rs.2 a kilo, aren't people still coming out to vote, sir? Though there's no water on announcing projects, aren't they joining to celebrate carrying flags, sir? When showed big factories that can change lives only on paper, aren't they giving up fertile lands, sir? People who believe myths so easily, if we work little hard, won't they believe good? When people were happy on banning cock fights, won't they accept if we say man killing man is wrong? All these years nobody came to us, first time you've come to us, are you here with genuine cause or in fear? With fear only sir. Fear of seeing a mother's tears for her lost son. Fear of children left as orphans losing their fathers. With so much fear in my heart, there's a truth to scare you also. If you say you can't help and I've to take to weapons, just 5 minutes is enough, sir. Not a man would be alive in there to lodge a complaint. I don't want it to happen, so I've come to you, sir. Please don't let it come to me. As a citizen I like your commitment, as an officer I'll do my duty. Greetings sir! What brings you here sir? I'd some work with Collector. - Is everyone fine, sir? - Fine. - Why did you salute him? - He's heir to Veeradurgam King! A man who lived like an orphan, how could he reach Veeradurgam fort? Mother, I'm hungry, serve food. Brother-in-law, you've become very generous. You're giving generously without bothering about account. Freshly milked, very tasty. You've to use sword, right? Have it. Ask him to have it. You've been free loading here for years, why don't you fight with sword? I'm not new to swords. If I take out my sword, people would take a leak in fear. - What? - Take a leak!- Is it? One fine day while I was using sword in good mood, lost the grip, so I've put it to rest in scabbard. Why not mend and use it again? Give me Rs.1 lakh from your account, I'll start again. If you make a hole into my account for everything, then I may have to come out with truths. - What are those truths? - I'll tell you. - How much money you've now? - I've Rs.5000. I've Rs.25000! It's Rs.30000 along with your money. Rs. 15000 for you and Rs. 15000 for me. No more kings and poor people. Socialism! I got good profit, it's good. What do you call it as? - They call it as socialism. - Socialism is very good. - What's the next ism? - Why? Rowdyism! Take out the money from your pocket. - I'll not, I like socialism. - Where's the knife? - Why knife? - It's knows as Goondaism is also! If you don't pay on asking, I can stab and plunder you. Will you stab me? Do you think I'm afraid of you? I don't want your socialism, take it back. - Hey short man! - Short? No, you're tall as Amitabh Bachchan. - I'm short. - Listen to me. If you ask me money again citing any silly reason, - I'll show you terrorism. - What is terrorism? I'll make you bend and shove a bomb into you from behind. He'll tell you what would happen after that. Tell him! Greetings sir. Please come in, let's discuss inside. Mother, Collector is here. Please have a seat sir. Would you like to have tea or coffee sir? Please sign this paper to withdraw your complaint. We hate to see the khaki colour. How dare you enter hour home! He's my son-in-law, sir. That girl is my newly married daughter, madam. I beg you, please leave them, sir. She's my wife, sir. In democracy anybody can say anything and you can hear it, but it mustn't be about us, do you know why God has given us two ears, Collector? If we hear anything not associated with us in one ear, to leave it from another ear. You heard with one ear. Didn't leave it from another. I want the ear that didn't listen even after hearing my name. Sir, it happened without knowing about you. He'll withdraw the complaint, please leave him, sir. - You too with law in your hands... - Beasts don't fear law! Entering his compound made me shiver seeing the sight. He has support of 3 lakhs voters, two MP's, 3 Ministers, 10 MLA's. I can't get justice for myself, how can I do justice to you? - Please listen to me... - Sign it. Understood now? You were born 25 years ago only. But violence in this region started 70 years ago. Is the Collector new to the region? Is the Government new? None of the elders who fought all these years didn't get this thought, were you the only one to get this idea? If killing 10 people can do good to a lakh people, is it right or crime? You're from city, I may not have knowledge like you, but I know the society and it's system. It's right to hunt the man eating beast. Leader is one who faces death to protect his people. Even medicinal herbs die to become medicines to man. You're also like that for being heir to this family. Kill for the sake of people, or else die! If you stand with empty hands and they carry weapons, change isn't possible, if you don't go, you'll see much more horrible things. Mother, first thing is to avoid fight, death is last resort. God decides in which way he'll take me. Uncle, your daughter is having labour pain. Let's go to hospital, get the boat. Sir! A woman is about to deliver a child. He said that a male child would fear to take birth in my family for 10 generations. Show him that forthcoming child would die if we see angrily! Cut it! Go fast, she may deliver here. Go quickly... go... fast... Please bear it dear. No need to fear. Why have they come? Go that side. Go... go... Go... go... go fast! You don't worry, dear. My dear... go fast! Oh God! Please bear it, dear. My father's order that no child should come into this world. Kill it! - No... go away! - Kill him! Brother-in-law, words won't do, you've to bash them. Hey, I've a habit from my childhood, I'll learn anything very quickly, show me a good thing, I'll learn it, show me a mistake, I'll correct it, death... don't show me death! If I see death and if enters my head from my heart, if I find a sword and a man like you, you won't get even pieces to sew together. You're nothing compared to my strength. Strength? Yours? An over grown pig can't become an elephant, you silly idiot! Reduce your sound. Next time if I hit it'll take 5 years for your voice to come out. Hey male child! Real man has come! Male babies would be born and live as men! Is it enough or you want more? You dirty rascal! - Son! - Mother! - How are you son? - I'm fine, mother. - How about you? - I'm fine. How are you son? My entire property is yours son-in-law, use it as you like for these people's welfare! I'm indebted to this region. You went to kill a child! She raised a baby for you to see! Unable to behead him, you shaved your head. Enemy is very intelligent. He's making us kill ourselves. Leave him as one more buffalo in the cattle. It seems men have returned to the place for him. Let's see! I don't want to slip but my silly leg always slips on seeing you. Did anything get damaged? Damage? No! My friend say you can't take liberty once you get know somebody. - May I take? - No... no... My father says you've put the watch on his hand, right? He says there's nothing wrong to cross limits now. May I cross? - No please. - I'm fairer than Sathya, right? - I'm a better figure than her, right? - Your mouth is louder than her. How could say like that? On waking up in the morning, how are you? What are you doing? Did you brush? Did you go to bathroom? Did you eat or not? Got up or not? Did you sleep well or not? Did you've coffee or breakfast? Did you've lunch? What would you've evening? Do you use dhoti or shorts while sleeping? Do you sleep without anything? Do you pray Sun on waking up or not? Won't you greet? I just ask very questions like these. But you called me loud mouth! Then I'll ask only one thing hereafter. - What? - Use me! Oh! She's killing me! You asked 50% that day, I'm all yours now. As you wish! There are marriageable aged girls in home, don't ever do like this. Sathya, get ready, we've to go to city with my sisters. What happened? We've come out of home for the first time. We've come out after our brother came home. Why are we going to city suddenly? I've fixed sister's marriage after festival. For shopping. Welcome brother-in-law! - Are you mad? - Any doubt? You've to cross my home to city, did you think of stopping over for tea, coffee or lunch? Please, I beg you... ready to fall at your feet too. - Stop... stop... - Step in for a moment only. Who told you I'm going to city? Bloody! He? Okay. Right leg... - Aren't you doing it over? - No, welcome. You too have a grand welcome inside. Grand welcome? What's that? - Welcome, brother-in-law! - I'll beat you! Chamundeshwari, get water for brother-in-law. - Lift it, I'll wash.- What? - Pant. Pant? You're very strong, if I ever marry I'll marry only you. Enough of washing, got him wet, you can go now. Go... go inside. One more girl? Brother-in-law got wet, get a dry towel. Will you dry it yourself or want me wipe you dry? I'll do it myself. You're like a good horse! If I ever marry, I'll marry only you. He's our relative, he will, you may go now. You said you don't have anyone. They're daughters of near by landlords. They saw your fight on the day of challenge. - Ever since they were pestering me. - What's this trouble? The matter is, I'm seeing it as different tales. It's difficult if one girl calls, if four girls call you at a time, you may get crushed, buddy. - Get lost! - It's normal for him. Marry all the four and have dozens of children! - Why don't you marry them? - Yours is swashbuckling royal family. You can manage any number of wives. Ours is loyal family! Only one wife! All the four are with good built and in great mood. Take a look! North is on high... South is sensational... East is rocking... West is inviting laying a bed... Your build is perfect in sync with building almanac, baby... It's inviting to befriend you... Fiery beauty on the South-East side... North-East side is charming with give and take policy... Breezy North-West is alluring with warm hugs... South-West is softly inciting the nerves... All directions are okay... I've got myself a female partner... There's no hurdle in romance.. There's no mistake in vital statistics... There's no bad air in my youth... There's no stopping to my happiness... How much I said about elevation... your decorations are little overboard... To get on the mat silently in master bedroom... Step in with right leg. - You're over doing it. - Its feel, brother-in-law. You've two or three but I've only one, right? - Bye brother-in-law. - Be careful! Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law! Nothing will happen to you, brother-in-law. Your idea is very great! But it won't stand before their gory dance of death. People have great hope that you'd bring a change in their lives. Keep their hopes afloat! To fight them you've to be this family's real heir. But I know you're not a real heir. If you stay here many more horrible things would happen. Go away! Brother! He would've run away in fear for our punch! Let's see if he runs away like a woman or fights like a man. Brother, he has come to fight. I said no but you made me pick the weapon! Come... come... come... Where are you? I let you live but you didn't take it. I've started killing! Not even God can stop me now! Please don't worry that they've killed us. We're there with you till death. We're there with you! This problem is mine! You don't have any connection with it. Till now I saw this problem differently, you're now going to see it totally different, it's my responsibility as the heir of this family. You can leave! Hello heir! Are you fine? You've settled down well. How dare you enter this place! Stop... stop... please listen to me. Stop! I'm here to settle one issue. That man you see as the heir is an orphan from Hyderabad. Elderly man of this family adopted him. Look at these photos. Would anyone adopt their own son? Tell me, are you heir to this family? Tell me! Hey remove your hand! Swear on me! You're my real brother, aren't you? Can I hold his collar now? Come man! If you've settled here, what have you done with the real heir? What have you done with him? You've killed him, right? Tell me! You've killed him, right? He has killed your son. My son was born dead 25 years ago, how can he kill him? I lied that he was alive and would come for people and family. I almost died when my son died. I died when my enemy showed mercy and left me alive. Your son must come after 25 years as you said. I'll kill him and make you cremate him. Till then I'll not let you die. I'll also not die. If you die to save pride, your family would also die. Go! Every year when you celebrated the birthday of prince, I lived inside offering food to his dead soul. I lied with a hope that God would send someone here. God himself came! Heir isn't just from blood but comes from good intentions. How can he not be your blood, son-in-law! He's your son! Unable to see my daughter's sorrow, I did a sin which no father would do, Today is very good day. You'll have a baby boy. No father, I wish for a girl. What am I left with in these fights, father? Only sorrows. If anything happens to him, they'll go after my son too. I can't bear to see as his mother. To make my daughter's wish come true, heir to this family mustn't be one to Kill the enemy, but one who wipes out enmity! Not one who wages war but one who can stop war. Had he been raised here, he would know only two things, kill or die! But he must know the value of life, he must know the value of life, he must know the value of hunger, he must know the value of hard work, he must know the value of tears, to know all this I left him in an orphanage, He should've been raised like a prince but struggled as an orphan. One who should've fed people in silver plates had yearn for a morsel of food. My child should've slept in silk beds but slept on pavements. I cried out my heart seeing all this. No human can bear so many difficulties. I did this to raise you from zero to hero! But I never left you alone. Even this girl too! We've been protecting you. Please forgive me. Forgive me, grandson! You gave up child for people. You killed your son for people's sake and died so many times over. You were born from your mother's aim! Now I see in you a man who can rewrite 70 year old history. For 25 years your mother and I waited for this, these people who lost their children waited for this, for this day only! Do what you like and people praise! Behead him before the same people who hailed him. Not a man supporting must live! Kill everyone male or female ruthlessly. You're still alive to kill me, you know it for 25 years. Just an hour ago I came to know I was born to kill you. 25 years of your vengeance and 25 years of my raising, is standing at your door! I'm here with my family and my people. It's the beginning of your end, and an end to this bloody war. I told you not to provoke me but you did and brought me to your door. Dare stop it now! Stop your men from running away! Save your heart from stopping dead! Dare to stop me from hoisting my flag here. Man with guts must attack from front not from behind. I've guts here! Hack me! Hack... hack me! Have you understood the fear of death? Man who shivers in fear isn't qualified to die. Go... live! Try... try if you've guts! If you've guts touch him! Dare touch him! Go! Is there any man here to touch him? Come, I'll cut them bloody rascals! Come on! Father, twirl your moustache. Bang your thigh, father. Hoist the flag here, let me see who will dare stop you. Come on! Not the symbol, system must come down! Power isn't in the sword! It must be in your blood! Pick it up! Get up! Hack me! Getup... get up... pick it and hack me! Come... come... come... Kill me.. Kill me... Remembered that he's your son? Aren't the people you killed somebody's sons? Were you sons born to mother and their sons from your slippers? In my opinion war means victory or defeat, but not kill or die! Take your son and send him to battle when he's fine, whether it is 10 hours or 10 days or 10 moths or 10 years, just inform me on phone an hour before, I'll wait before your home! You talked big about history! Before I could reach your threshold from the gate your history is over, it took hardly ten minutes for me, had I concentrated on you for an hour? Imagine! Were you waiting 25 long years for this? Did you create so much havoc for this? This is not life. Feed poor people, they'll remember even after you're dead, save few lives and they'll remember you for generations, wish good for the society, you'll live in hearts forever. That is life! Do you know God's greatest boon to you? Your age! That's why I'm sparing you. Go! Live! In my 70 years of life, I've seen victory and defeat, I've seen deaths, but first time in life I'm seeing a man! You've won over my ego of I'm God! You've won over my years of vengeance. My ego is to kill and your aim to stop it. Aim is greater than ego. You're right! Many males may be born in a family, but there will be only one man to win! Your son is a man! He's a man, an epitome of courage and bravery! He came alone to take head on the problem of this region, that is the character of a leader, and people are supporting him, that is leadership quality! Flag of such a leader must not only flutter here, - it must flutter on every home! - Hail prince! Host the flag! Carry the leader!
