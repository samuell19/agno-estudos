The fighters. The survivors. Against the grain and against the odds. It's a time-worn story, but this one takes you somewhere different. Wacken Open Air. In the world of heavy metal, this is the pinnacle of music festivals. The road to the stage cannot be bought. It must be earned through respect, passion, and authenticity. And this year it will be headlined by a new breed; self-managed, self-made, self-defined. The last band anyone saw coming. The underdogs. - ♪ Oh oh oh - These are the biggest festivals in the world. It's fucking wild. - If rock is dead, somebody ain't looking. - There's this ongoing conversation that's becoming, kind of more and more vital at the moment about who the next headliners are gonna be. - Obviously there's no Black Sabbath anymore. Aerosmith is saying it's the last time round. And as an industry, you've gotta be looking at, you know, who are the artists that are gonna come through and gonna be festival headliners of the next few years? - Yeah, hello. My name is Jia O'Connor. - I'm Luke Thomas Kilpatrick. - In five years... - Five years... - ...in five years, hopefully, I'll be hitting wood, still. - If Parkway's over, which it probably will be, realistically. - I could be an electronics man. Awesome. - An electrician. - An electrician. - He'll also fix pedals. - That's it. - Fix guitar pedals. - I will fix guitar pedals. - Maybe a baby on the way. - I'll be in this band, tour the world, I'll have a good head still, hopefully, and that'll get me somewhere in this world. - I'm 23, a bit old. Then I'll be 28, that's even older. I've got not much, so, I'm not going many places. - My Australian mates, Parkway Drive, in the house, yeah! - They wanna be one of the biggest metal bands in the world. - The next generation, it has to start now. - Metal doesn't need the mainstream. We don't need mainstream approval, we don't need to be getting high-charting albums to survive. - Fuck the Top 100. Fuck all that bullshit. - You've gotta put on great shows, you've got to have people coming to the gigs and leaving thinking, "Wow". Big shows does not come cheap. But, it is about investing in the future. - We're the biggest we've ever been by far, and we're potentially losing money on the tour, - not making money. - Yeah. - And you've just gotta say it's... - No, we all know that. - So this is fine, but... - It's not even the issue. - It's a hard thing. - We all agreed to it. - Yeah, it's the future and that's all I care about. We're at the level where it's a rabbit hole and where does it end? - How expensive those arenas are that we're going into, like, it's gonna be really hard to put on a good show, of what we should be putting on, and to make good money as well. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, so that's just, in a sense always been, you know, do this, get bigger. - Get bigger always. - Yeah, the investment stage. I still think the investment stage is great, I'm not... - 'Cause I don't think you realise that we never made that greater money on the headliners. - We keep fucking splitting hands and getting winning hands every time - and still fucking splitting 'em, - For sure. - And doubling down over and over and over again. - Yeah. - And there definitely is a point where, like, the risk keeps getting higher. - If you go to arenas and sorta fail, then, it's a pretty bad look. - If we're gonna aim for those festival headlining slots, which is what we've all said, like that's where, - That's the goal. - That's the goal. If we get to that status, it doesn't matter what your headlining club shows are, we're there no matter what. - Yeah, I know... - But, to get there, you've gotta put that show on in that area. And that's it. And you've gotta do an arena gig. - It kinda blows my mind that you two are so worried about it. - No one's that worried about it, it's more of like, what's next? Just knowing that, you know, we're not gonna just constantly change... - This is all communication because everything you guys are saying and concerned about is everything that's already been thought about, - and also, on a similar path. - Yeah, well, that's the thing. - That's why it's important to tell everyone, so everyone knows. - Well, it's important to have these things. Every time, we think of an idea, - or think of something, I can't bring up everything. - Yeah, that's right. - We just have to have these regularly like we're gonna. - Yeah, that's all I expected, to be honest. - We're about to get our first look through these doors. - Come and see what we have here. Welcome, welcome. - We are here in Berlin for day one of rehearsals. It's pretty surreal, to be honest. This is where we get to see all those little sketches, and drawings, and plans we do on napkins in hotel rooms every night actually come to life on stage. It's great. - I haven't even thought about playing songs, once, so. - Yeah, I've been changing nappies pretty much the whole time so, the idea of playing a guitar and having fire going off, and lights and shit in my eyes, it's pretty foreign. - Fuckin' hell! - Whoa. - It's too much, I think. - Nah. That's fine. Basically, we're making nothing, like, straight up. Pouring every cent the shows make back into putting the show on, which, that's kind of our strategy I guess, our business strategy. We think it makes a difference. Oh, hang on, I gotta watch. Huge. This is the biggest tour we've ever done. It's the biggest shows, the most people, the biggest rooms, biggest production. Every single thing we have, we are putting into this. The goal is for everyone, every night, to leave with their jaw on the floor, and for us to prove that we've earned those headlining slots at this summer's festivals. I'm feeling all hyped up and excited, 'cause that was basically the best lights I've ever seen. - Pretty fucking mental, like pretty mental. It's by far the psycho-ist thing we've done. First time we've ever had to dial it back. First time we set lights on fire by accident. Created a pressure wave from too much pyro and blew out the sound guy's ears, which is pretty nuts. It sucked all the oxygen outta the room. But, we're good to go. - A lot of people didn't really know what quite to make of Parkway when they first turned up. - Parkway Drive is a bunch of surf rats. - They were like a bunch of surf bums playing hardcore. - They came out of the van with slippers on. - It always seems like they came straight off like a boat in flip-flops being like, "hey guys, we're here!" - Here we go, are you ready? - ♪ You could never be my envy ♪ You could never Be my jealousy ♪ ♪ You could never be my envy - Snow! ♪ You could never Be my jealousy ♪ - Here we go! - ♪ Oh ♪ No forgiveness - Woo! - You're Australian, man, you guys are fucking weird. I'm happy to have you guys here, Parkway Drive in Southern California, welcome. I remember, back in the day, you guys have been around for 15-something years now. Australia, you Byron Bay mates, you bloody cunts. You had to go from humble beginnings in Byron Bay to little shows in backyards, but what was the smallest show where you were like, "Wow, there's one person here?" - When we started this, it was tiny. - ♪ Go - I've gotta funny story that I don't think I've ever said before. So this is how small our town is, that Jeff lives on a certain street. And used to play guitar there and I didn't really know him at that point, 'cause he's a few years older, and a bit of a nerd. He was at school. My parents moved into this house next door to him, we used to hear this metal guitar next door and my dad used to just go, "Fuckin', that noise next door". "That guy just plays all this shit music." But then, yeah, years later when we joined the band, I was like, oh, you're the guy that lived next door. - Yeah, yeah. - Wow! - Originally recording was like a loan from my parents. And then, it was like, saving up merch money and that was it. But once we got overseas, the way we did it was we bought a round-the-world ticket and we went to Europe, and then we went to America, and then we came back around. So, that was the cheapest way of doing it, but it meant we had to go away for five or six months without going home. - Let's go! - Woo, woo-hoo hoo. - A lot of you guys don't know we're Parkway Drive from the other side of the fucking world. - Carrion! - ♪ In a moment I'm lost ♪ Dying from the inside ♪ Her eyes take me away ♪ Tear me apart From the inside out ♪ - The essence of Parkway is that they were just heavier than everybody else. - ♪ Dead eyes speaking volumes - They were definitely different, especially compared to a lot of American bands. They were a lot more down-to-earth, a lot more adventure-based. - There was something about them, you wanted them to win. - ♪ Built upon sorrow ♪ We're walking - They skipped the hotels and slept in sleeping bags on the side of the highway. Which, it was unheard of by that time, and I loved it. - We're in Africa looking for a hotel. We found her, boys. - 'Cause we actually really enjoyed it 'cause it was all new and fun. To us it was an adventure. We were eating other people's food. - We were stealing food off like the headlining band's riders. All of a sudden, we're getting legit festival slots. - The shows would go from 500, to 1,000, to 5,000. - ♪ My love I left ♪ My heart - Parkway were like a drug and everybody wanted it. Everyone was talking about them. - The band's just getting bigger and bigger. Fucking growing, they're doubling their fans every year. - ♪ A promise to return ♪ A promise ♪ To ♪ Return - These guys have had a huge rise, but what's interesting about them is that they gave all the crew time to grow with the band as well. We were basically thrown in the deep end where we said that production's gonna start getting crazy now, learn how to get it done. This has remained the same camp, pretty much untouched. - Fucking movie makers. Fucking dick bags. ♪ Fucking filmers ♪ I hope you can hear Did you hear my little song? How often do I make people cry? Too often, but probably not often enough. - The make up of the band and where they've come from, and everything involved, I think is what makes them so unique. When they needed a bass player they got a merch guy, who couldn't play a bass, as their bass player. They could've got any bass player in the world and they chose Pie. - Is this your first show, dude? - You can kinda gauge their personalities from watching who they are on stage. Jeff loves talking shit. - Aww, that's not what I ordered. - I think Ben's definitely the biggest naturalist in this band. Through the whole touring circuit and everything kinda weighs down on him. Ideally, he would wanna be next to a river shoving a pinecone up his ass. - Winston is a tour manager's wet dream. So Winston needs two things: a bus and a video game console. And he's gonna be on that bus with that console 24/7. - ♪ What comes next ♪ Blood, sweat, tears ♪ We're still here - As a complete group, an absolute pack of fucking weirdos. - You guys are a self-managed band. - Yeah. - And that's hard. - Yeah. - Because you guys are a big band. I know small bands that have managers and all these other people working with them, and I feel like they have a hard time. How do you do it? - As the band's evolved, we've taken on the different roles within the band and the management side of things has, like, gone to Luke. - I don't know what I'm doing, like honestly. And I'll be the first to admit I don't know how a manager should do shit. Hang on, I gotta tell you something quickly. - The funny part is that he's not a very social person. So it's kinda odd, and I like to see how uncomfortable it can get for him, having to be that person. And I fucking love seeing him uncomfortable; that's a big joy for me. But, actually, I think he's doing a great job. - I can't imagine another band that could spend the money we're spending because they've got managers and other people taking a piece of the pie. Where those pieces of the pie remain with us, so we put it back into our show and into our performance. And it seems to be setting us apart. - We're on the official first European run for the "Reverence" album. It's the biggest production crew they ever had. Just Parkway Drive, without the supports, we are 45 to 50 people. There's a lot on the line. Like, if this tour would fail, it would be pretty bad for the band. - I've just got this weird, anxiety feeling. I'm not that into it. - Yeah, I've had it the whole time. - Just fighting the jet-lag, having a full battle with it. I think I'm winning. - We going again? The mental mountain of this has been, seems like it's been greater than actually the physical one. I can get my body to do things, but you can't trick your mind into feeling a certain way. And this feels like standing at the bottom of Mount Everest. - It's not about them, it's about them that are out there, and blowing people's minds. And that's why I respect them so much, 'cause they actually give a fuck. - Look at all of 'em. That's bad, Fishy. There's 72 light fixtures, that once they get moved, they don't stop moving and they just sway, and it just looks untidy and fucked. I've been asking for two days to see it fixed, though. And I haven't seen it. - We made a giant Parkway logo, to throw a Molotov at and blow up. - Molotov, take one. I think there needs to be more time of it. Like, that was quick. We're looking at you for like 30 seconds, it doesn't seem long enough. I know we're pushing the boundaries and I'm fine with pushing the boundaries, but I just wanna know what we're doing. - Everything you see on stage is designed by someone within Parkway, which is pretty mad. You have to stand on stage to figure out where pyro is gonna go around moving machinery, around classically-trained musicians while we're tearing through this music that we wrote in our basement. - Have they practised yet? - What's that? - Have they even practised? Or have they never seen this before? Have you given them the music before? - What they're playing is, not even close. - Is it all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, does it have something at the end? Or, that's it? - There's that whole extended string chart. - Yeah. - She sent the wrong music. - Fuck. Are you gonna tell them? - I know it's gonna work, even if we fuck it up it's gonna work. - When the fellas walk to the stage. - I open the door. - Yeah, that's it. - Boom! Follow, spot, open the door, walk out. - Let me know when you're ready, Marko. Fuck it, let's run it. - ♪ The truth drops like a bomb Whoa. What the fuck? Nice. Seriously, that's fucking mental. - I'm fried. I'm actually fried. Can I stop talking? I actually didn't realise how much work this was. I thought you'd just come here, make sure everything's sweet and under control, but micro-manager has to do everything. - Hamburg. First show of tour. Yeah, it's sold out. We finally got our shit together, and yeah, we're fucked. - Day one of tour and last night a bug came through and half the crew are spewing and shitting, including myself. So I've got my spew bucket for stage. - So this is the most vicious virus I ever have dealt with. It's insanity. - Pie is hyped on the sold-out show. - You're fucked? - What? - You okay? - Ah, spewing my guts up. And I can still taste the spew in my mouth. - I hope there's some projectile vomiting and shitting during this show. That could be a new effect that we haven't tried before. - Poor bastard. Oh, you poor bastard. Ready to go. - All right! - Go, Fish. - Let's go in three, two, - Anytime fellas. - One.

I'd say, highest ratio of mosh pits, to non-mosh pit we've ever had at the Bottom Feeder part. - It was literally - That was insane. - the entire fucking thing. Psyched. - Yeah, you had to see the crowd. - Good times. - That's true. - If we have a situation like the one that we had today, Pie, you cannot hold me back. - There's no need to go through it now. It's fine. - and I was trying to diffuse the situation. - Talk about it later That's not what I was trying to talk about. - Yeah, but I was gonna punched in the head. - Let's address it later. We just played a good show, let's not talk about this now. - All right, I'm sorry. I'll let you do your thing. - All right. - If someone's about to arc up and punch ya, I'm gonna try to get them away. - There's a lot of things that are not going like they're supposed to go, and there's a lot of things that go great, but the things that go wrong, we need to learn how to deal with it. - Yeah, I mean, we just played the best show of our lives, and we've taken the smallest little incident, blown it out of proportion, and somehow made the whole gig feel like a failure. But, to be honest, I think it's like, it's the pressure. Like, we're putting too much pressure on everyone, on ourselves, and right now I think everything, it just feels like everything is sitting right on a knife's edge. And, if we don't get this sorted, I'm pretty concerned about where this could be heading. - ♪ Lift it up, lift it up ♪ On your fuckin' feet Let's go ♪ ♪ A system of complete control ♪ The pressure builds ♪ It wraps its hands Around your throat ♪ ♪ A constant battle ♪ A silent war, are you ready ♪ One, two, three, sing it ♪ Get up, get up - Sickest show ever. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - What's exploded? Fucking hell, are you serious? We got nothing? Can you guys hear me? Oh, the front-of-house has gone down! - Headlining show in Hollywood, we're sold out. And, it's the first time, almost ever, we've probably gotta bar it. The PA just exploded. - Not good. - Fuck! - The last thing we ever want to do as a band is cancel a show. We will play tired, we will play sick, we will play with broken bones. It's what we love to do. So when something goes wrong that's beyond our control, it's just crushing. At the end of the day, all we want to do is give people something that is worth their time. Worth the connection that we have. It just leaves you feeling helpless and that is a daunting feeling heading into European festival season. This is our first headline set of 2019. Summer festivals, like, it's a pretty big responsibility and we've got a mental show, and it's the biggest thing like, look at the crap they're putting up there, Fishy's in charge of all this stuff. - Fishy has quite a challenge ahead of him with the summer festivals. - We're all learning every single tour, like 'cause, we've never done a production as big as it, that we're currently working on. - Yeah, you know you can get to the top of that crane? If you wanna put a 50-footer up there they have pyro boxes, you can see boxes and shit up there already. - If we can have 11 50-foot flames go off at the same time I get excited. - Fishy, he has literally come just as far as we have. We took our friends from Byron on tour with us, on an Australian tour. Right before we went on to play, our amps blew up. It was enough for us to go, "Right, the whole show is fucked". Little Fishy runs out to the light switch on the wall, rips the light switch off, and just starts pulling wires and shit out of the wall. Rewired the cabs from this shit he found in the wall and got it going again. We're like, "What the fuck did you just do?" and he's like, "Nah, it's fine, training to be a sparky". We got him on tour and he got put through the wringer as a kid. But every time there's been like a break point where we've needed someone to step up, Fishy stepped up. He's literally gone from that 11-year-old kid sitting behind Gaz at our first-ever show, to running this entire operation. - They're lucky to have me, after 10 years, they're lucky I'm still here. - You know where we're walking on from? - Up there. Oh, right. - Straight under there. - Oh, I had a different visual. - I was thinking it was back up, that's perfect. - Yeah. This gets blocked off and they're getting tarps here so no-one can see in, so we can light the entire fucker up. Kick the gate open and walk down and stop at the top here, with the cameraman. Get to the edge there and that's when I do the Moses. - Yeah, yeah, "excuse me I'm coming through". - And try and get the whole festival to part. - Really good. - Moses of the mosh. - Does Fishy know about this? - No, but he's on stage, so it doesn't matter. You walk up onto a big stage with a massive barrier, but you get there through the people. It's what the whole thing's about in the first place. Keep it coming. You keep pushing that level up! Here's a heavy one. We good? Let's lift that fucking bar higher. Holy shit! Oh, my God, that's too much cardio for me. 12 years! 12 fucking years! I fought for this.

Thank you for helping us out. Thank you, guys. - Let's go have a look. Keep looking up here, 'cause this is where the shit's going down. I don't know, right now I've got no idea what's going on with the Resurrection Fest. Hopefully we get to play. I don't know what protocol is with the lightning going off. They might just have to shut it down, in case everything blows up, but I don't know. Right now we're holed up in buses. - As soon as you see a storm come over while you're at a festival, that's instantly in the back of your mind, thinking what could happen. - We thought we got it figured out after two weeks, and that's the problem. Every time you think and say, "we, or, I got this," that's when shit goes wrong. - So, Slayer was supposed to go on stage half an hour ago. You see that storm? We'll see. We drove for three days to make it down to Spain to play this show. So, hopefully, it's gonna happen. We'll find out. Fish for Osie? Position? I'm gonna come out there and visit you real quick. - Copy that. - Fuck you, storm. - Fuck you. - Fuck you, fuck this storm. - Fuck you! - How's it looking? - Here we go. - ♪ The truth ♪ Drops ♪ The truth ♪ Drops ♪ The truth ♪ The truth drops like a Someone dropped the ball somewhere with some pretty big shit. And it's really fucking frustrating, because takes you a long time to get here and you want it to be perfect. Like, I want everything we do to be on point. Because why do it, if it's not the best it can be? We don't write a show, hoping half of it works. We write a show and drill that shit so it's, like, perfect, because we want the experience to be amazing. Stage clothes stolen, security bails on us halfway through the pit in the walkthrough. Stand on stage, my monitors explode, pyro jets start misfiring, spray oil all over the stage. So, we now are hoping we don't go up in flames, and also trying to stand on an oil slick stage. Oh, yeah, this is after the stage got shut down from a lightning storm. Walk back on for the Molotov, and whoever the fuck was in charge of the Molotov tonight didn't fuel the fucker up, so the whole thing didn't catch alight. Then the pyro was still on safety so when Fishy hit the pyro cues, nothing fired off. The end of the day, Spain has the biggest fucking heart there is when it comes to singing along and supporting this band, so that's great. Everything else is a fucking struggle. - Parkway, as a group, is always a step ahead of itself and the whole operation seems to be always one step behind. - He's on the phone right now. He's fucking furious. We need to talk about the future. He's done. - It's not hard to ask for 100%, like, it really isn't. That's the thing. I get there being little mistakes here and there, but there hasn't been a 100% run yet, and we're at the end of the first leg of festivals. And, when we're basically gonna have a reset of three weeks and then everyone's gonna, all these guys are gonna just go, "Oh, it's start of tour again." And reset, and we're gonna have another run of shows where it takes them three weeks to get their shit together. - I have a feeling we just need to tighten it up - Yeah, that's it. We've spent the last 15 years surviving together. No-one saw this coming, no-one planned any of this. We just put our heads down and we did it. But we are burnt out. The crew and the band, we are just burnt out. We need a break. We need a reset, because if we don't actually enjoy what we're doing, then what is the point? - I'm not quite exhausted, but I do enjoy the first sunrise back. The sand under the feet, like, generally, that's the sign of being home for me. It's two completely different worlds being at home and being on tour, and I love both of them so much. They're two different adrenalines, I guess. Two different kinds of focus. Yes. Swell. Offshore and pumping, and no-one out. Yes! It's such a good feeling to be able to wash the tour off straight away. It's like the polar opposite for me, but I need it just as much, and that's sitting in the ocean. Ah, gee, thanks, Belle. I just love being a dog-owner. You could poo any... Oh, my God. So you're on TV and you're making me double hop. Life. Life. Life used to be so simple. Now it's complex. Fuck. Hey, Big Rig, it's time for guitar practice. Okay? All right, you ready? That's it, we'll start in C minor. Yep, C, oh, very good. You're very talented, aren't you? Come on, Big Rig, out you get. Ah, you did very well, buddy. 11 months old and already miles ahead of Luke, aren't you? You're a much, much better guitarist than him, aren't you? - How's the Jeff Studios going? - Oh, the usual. - Still got the Belkin splitter, sticky-taped down to the upside-down bucket? - Professionalism. - This is Jeff's pride and joy. It's the only barrel he's ever gotten, so it's on his wall. - That was me when I was 10. Before these guys ever know what surfing was, I was in the tube. - Yeah, imagine just following that thing up. - ♪ 'Cause tonight I'm killing gods ♪ Let's fucking go. - Woo, that AC's struggling, aye? - Yeah, it's fucking filthy.

They have to be authentic. - I mean, that's nothing you can fake, you know, you either have that, or you don't have it. - Nobody can copy Lemmy or, nobody can copy Angus Young. - It's nothing that a million-euro production can buy, so you have to grow as a person in order to present yourself to 100,000 people. - A lot of the festivals realised what part we can deliver and I think a lot of the old guard and the old bands also realised that there's something new around the corner. I don't know if it's a competition, but, it kinda is, right? People were supposed to take it easy and relax a little bit in two weeks, and Jia had the great idea to play minor league soccer in Byron Bay and get his leg fucked up pretty bad. - I'm not surprised, just, typical Parkway shit. - So we don't know how we're gonna play this, if we're gonna play it down or are we gonna give him the ultimate bass moment. It all comes down to what he can do, really, because he's pretty fucked. - Look, look, I'm totally fine. Like, look, this is me getting around. It's fine. - That does not look fine, that looks fucking hilarious. - Oh, my poor baby. - Welcome to the bus. - I like the fluoro blue. I think I had the idea that coming on tour would be smelly, farty boys. - Jodi wanted the full tour experience. - Sorry, Jodi, but this is how it is. - And it was like you could see just the family camaraderie. - Composure! - As a mum, it made me really happy. - Winston's mum came to a festival last year and had, like, an epic time, she was like up on stage. - Come one, come on. Say hello to my mother. What's this song called? Let 'em know. - "Bottom Feeder!" - ♪ One, two, three, go So when we got home from tour all the band mums were pretty jealous. Jia's mum, I've seen every single day at the coffee shop, and she's just been going on and on about how this year she's gonna one-up my mum. - Yeah, she's pretty excited about it, cause I gave her the thumbs-up to come to Wacken. - Jodi's up for anything. Jodi literally said she's up for anything. So, yeah, we're in for something. - This is it. This is the big one. We are rolling into Wacken. And, oh, my God. This thing is huge. - Hey, mate. How are ya? - This is almost I'd say, the pinnacle of our career, it seems like, headlining this festival. This is basically the biggest festival, metal festival in the world. The Wacken circle pit. - Yee-haa! - This is the moment. This is what we're all here for. It's amazing. It's finally happened. - Here you go, sir. - Thank you. - I'm fucking psyched. - Fuckin' psyched? - I can't wait. - You psyched? - Yeah! - I'm Jeff Ling, and we're seconds away from the biggest show of our fucking lives. - Oh, my God! - Everyone's losing their fucking minds. Losing their minds. - Are they the underdogs in the music industry? - That's kind of a stupid question; they wouldn't be here this year if they haven't proved it. They're right in there on top of the list. They will prove it tonight, I'm sure. - Prey for the sorrow. It's alive, can you feel it? Prey for the sorrow Move. Hail my All Hail my.

Five days ago our bass player broke his knee. And we almost had to cancel. But instead, tonight, Wacken, I give you the new and improved bass player, in a wheelchair. Give it up for Jia and his mum! Oh, fuck, it's a family affair. We're so fucking happy to be here, thank you for having us. - Mum, mum, mum! - How are you doing now, Jodi? You wanna go out? - Mum, mum! - You wanna go out?

Peace, be safe! - You can never predict the turns life will take, and some destinations will be more than anything you could ever have dreamed of. All you can do is trust the people next to you, put your faith in those who share your passion, and have the courage to step into the void. Moments like these don't just happen, they are born. Through the trust of friends, the sacrifice of our families, the skill and unending hard work of our crew, and the support and connection of every single fan who has ever given us their time. Yeah, it might be a time-worn story, but this one is ours, and we wouldn't want it any other way. Against the grain and against the odds until the final song is sung. Viva the underdogs. - Well fucking done, brother. - Yeah, Fish. - Yeah, fucking Fish. - That was bullshit. - Fuck, that was a good show. - Well done. - It was massive fire. - Oi, that walk-in was psycho. - Everyone was grabbing my hands and other places. And I'm like, yeah, baby. - Come on. - Get real. - She's not my mum. - Well, you've gotten better since you were jamming at the house. - See you, mum, love ya. - A long time ago we asked ourselves what we'd be doing in five years' time. We were all wrong. We were all wrong. - Not me, I was the only one that said. - Did you say we'd still be going - I was the only one that said, we'd still be going and touring the world. - Fuck. - Fuck, I get it. - That is it. There it is. Movie's done, and out.
