What on Earth did I promise? The promise. Say "ah". Open up. Good morning. - Good morning. Grandpa, hold on. It's okay. Stay with grandpa. - Yeah? Be careful not to boil the soup. - Okay. Next, some nice warm soup. 3 Missed Calls I'll be back with some more tea. It's back. It's here again. It's here. That restaurant is really good. Let's go with everyone next time. I'm looking forward to it. Have a nice night. - See you. Incoming Call Hello. Izumi? Mika? It's been forever. How many years? Maybe 10. Not since junior high graduation. Wow, it really has been a long time. Sorry to call you out of the blue. No, it's nice to hear you're still the same. What's up? Are you free on Saturday? I'd like to meet up. Sudden as always. Sure. Really? I'm glad. Thanks so much. I'll call you again. Save me as Mika. - Okay. See you. - Bye-bye. NURIKABE Good night. - See you tomorrow. Koyama, are tomorrow's documents done? Yes, I handed them in. Didn't I say to show them to me when you were done? I'm sorry. - You did it on purpose. Whatever. You can go home. Was that building a hotel? Your window is wide open. Doing it on purpose? Uh-oh. A strip show, huh? Look this way, you pervert woman. I need a vacation. I'm home. See! I told you to take an umbrella. It just started raining. Where are you going, mum? - Grandpa took off. Again? Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! - For heaven's sake! What is it? - What are you doing? Mum is worried. Let's go home. - I don't want to. Why not? - It keeps looking at me. Staring from the tree in the garden. It doesn't exist. - It does. Let's go home. - No. You'll catch a cold. We'll go. - No! No! Dinner is ready. - No, no, no! KARAKASA Hello, Mr. Yamashita? - Yes. Hi. This is Mizunuma from Real Side Finance. How're things? Look, what's the deal? You promised to drop 200,000 yen in our account... ...by the end of the day. Yes. If you miss a day,... ...interest is 20,000 yen a day. Got it? Well..... - If you go to the cops,... ...you'll be sorry! Got something to say? Well? Say it. I'm all ears. You're a snake. Dirt of the earth. Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell. - Oh, yeah? I'll be happy to accept your offer and will gratefully go to hell. Pay up tomorrow, pretty please! Next. Go to hell. Oh, no. Are you okay? Okay? What? Nothing? Come on! I just bought these. Come on, man. Go to hell Mizunuma What the hell? What are you? I said..... Hey! Monster! Mizunuma It's back. What? It's back. Not again. Damn you! Mum, I'm going out. What could grandpa be fighting? Come to think of it, he used to say... ..."Among those who don't realize they're dead,... ...and those who wander with regret,... ...some will do harm to humans. When that happens, we must fight." This means there's something there? You believe it? Come on. You started it, mum. Take this with you. Grandpa! You surprised me! Take it with you. - What is it? It's "damn you". "Damn you"? - "Damn you". "Damn you". - Yeah. UMIBOZU Lame. - Let's go home. I'm sick of this. What's that? Something came out of the sea. Where? There. A whale? What? There's nothing. Noisy brats. What now? You can see it through the hole. What? - Look. Oh! For real! It opened its eyes! Is it a kaiju? - Get real. It's just some weird building. It's moving. It's coming! It's mouth! Kids, what's wrong? That smell..... On the seawall in Chiba,... ..."Ryu Kuwana, a self-employed man,... ...was fishing and went missing. Authorities will continue the search today. His fishing tools were at the scene. But no other clues have been found. You gave me a heart attack! - You're as cuddly as ever. What if I was the wrong person? I'd tiptoe away. You'd be more suspicious then. It's been so long! You haven't changed a bit. Really? You too. Late as always. Sorry, but it took time to get ready. Hurry! Hurry! - Slow down. The place is always packed. What's that? It's nothing. Sato, got a new camera? A present to myself. I want to get better, even if it's a little. Before that, learn the basics. - Yeah, right. HAKO ONNA No accidents for 506 days Open it already. Slowpoke. Wow. Sato. I'm getting a hard-on. Again? Back off. Look at that! Right on! Check it out. Sato. Sato! Get over here. What? What is that? Nice. Can't see. Is it a mannequin? A person? Should we call the police? An ambulance? Hold on. Sato. Let's pull her out. Hold on. I'll call an ambulance. - Just do it already. What the hell? She's heavy! Nice one, Sato. What the hell? Just keep at it. Sato! What is it? Who'd do something like this? A pervert, obviously. Sato. Pry it open. - Me again? Who else? What are you doing, Sato? You broke it. What is that? What's happening? It's salty! Seawater? Genda. My nose. Blood! A monster! Go away! - Genda! Wait! The Mika mark! Such memories. You drew it on notebooks and covers. And on the school's bathroom wall. - That's right. I told you not to. I was scolded for it too. I'd often play explorer and drag you along. I couldn't leave you alone. You were so all over the place, you know. I caused you much grief as kids. We drifted apart in junior high. Why was that? Well, I have forgotten. ROKUROKU Who's the model? Holy! Mamika. Yeah, me. Is that a problem? Why are you skipping class? I saw her from a hotel window the other day. She's beautiful. - Sure is. Getting absorbed is fine, but come to class sometimes. You're short on credits. You know I know that! - Really? Okay, I'll go to class. - You promise? I do. I do. - You promised, right? Yes, I did. I did some looking. The hotel you saw her from,... ...it doesn't exist. Where did you really stay? Who is she? Answer me! Almost done. She was watching all the time. Every single day. Rainy days. Snowy days. Staring at the spot where the baby fell. Always. Always. What're you saying? Almost there. It's almost there. Almost. Yosuke, you're being weird. Almost done. Almost done. That's enough! Yosuke? What is it? Is this a hotel? I guess so. Want to go here? They should have a restaurant. Okay. Here we go! Izumi? - Sorry. You're really getting married? - Yeah. Is he older? He'll be 30 this year. We've been living together for two years. What does he do? It's a long story. To be honest, he's between jobs. I see..... Are things tough? We're in debt. Is it his debt? - It is, but not so much. Is he looking for a new job? He's looking, but you know. Not much out there. Sorry, got to go to the lady's room. Kento 58 Missed Calls 58 calls? Stop ignoring me! Where the hell are you? Come home now or I'll kill you! NEKOME He's suddenly swinging his cane and yelling, "Damn you!" It's disturbing. Everyone around here knows that codger. Don't worry, he's harmless. - Really? Just an old nut. It's scary to think my folks might be like that someday. I'm back. Where did you get this? I was playing and my balloon flew away. Then a lady gave me this. A lady? Who? - I don't know. A strange lady. - Strange? Where was it? The cat park. What is this stuff? She said it's a baby cat. - A baby cat? I promised to take care of it. - Promised? Doesn't it smell bad? Sorry but I have to return this. Kana, go home like a good girl. Strange. So long. Kana, open the door! What is this place? Mama? Mama? HITOTSUME What happened? Ms. Kusunoki? What? What? Sorry, it's my glasses..... I dropped my contacts too. What to do..... Watch out. I'll clean it up now. I'm sorry. I've terrible eyesight and can't see a thing. I'm in trouble. Ms. Kusunoki? Hold on, I'm..... Ouch! It's okay, Ms. Kusunoki. It's okay. I'm coming now. Ms. Kusunoki? It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry, Ms. Kusunoki. Hello. Kusunoki in room 406 has taken a turn for the worse. Who? - Kusunoki in room 406. Hey! - Is someone there? Kusunoki left the hospital this evening. No one is supposed to be there. Are you there, Azusa? Hello? Azusa? Izumi. Actually..... Look, is he really okay? Does he really care about you? Did you pick up my call? - I'm sorry. How could you answer someone's phone? I'm really sorry. But I think you should reconsider. You know nothing. Don't judge me! I'm not judging. I just want you to be happy. You're annoying. Your hypocrisy hasn't changed at all! You too. You get in a bad mood fast. You try to ignore what's inconvenient. Just like before. In junior high you dated someone I liked. You said you'd stand by me. - That was..... First of all, you've never once kept a promise. You're shallow. That's why..... You don't have to say it, I know. Hello? Izumi. Oh, god. Mum? What's wrong? It's grandpa. Grandpa..... KAMAITACHI That's enough for now. - Yes, boss. Didn't know they were building a hotel here. Yeah, before we knew it. After deciding on the Olympics,... ...they'll be building them one after another. Guess we'll be busy. - I bet. It's much appreciated. - It is for sure. I pulled my back. It hurts. - Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. It was something out of place. Here. Thanks. She's probably napping right about now. Kazuko again? A grandchild is more adorable than a child. So long tough guy image. - Idiot. You'll understand when you have a grandchild of your own. What? A bad omen? What's happening? Are you okay? - I'm fine. A child? What? Boss! I shall return. 1964 Tokyo Olympics Decided I knew it wasn't a dream. Damn you! It's grandpa. Grandpa..... Grandpa? What about him? I got home and he was..... Hello? Hello? Something's happened. I have to go. Hey, Izumi! You're not lonely, right? DAIDARA Yoko. You're late! Where are you? 9th floor, I think. What floor are you on? 12th, on the roof. You're almost here. She said the 12th floor. Hey now..... Do we really got to go all the way up to the roof? I saw flowers on the first floor. It's tiring and creepy. So she says. - Maybe so. But it's closer to heaven up here. Maybe she'll hear us better. Mahiru? Hello? Hello? It cut off. - What'd she say? Don't know. She's upstairs. Let's go. Is she mad? - Furious! Said we're too late. The 12th floor? - Yeah, three more to go. No way I can do this. - She'll freak out. Well, we're going. - No way! Wait for me. Don't leave me! Made it. It's filthy. - This is no good. She's not here, is she? - Maybe the bathroom? Over there? - Who'd go up there? Let's check. - What a pain. It'd be like her to go up there. Did she really jump to her death? She was so lively. I can't believe you guys actually left me. Where is everyone? - Up here! We're here. - I said the 12th floor. You see Mahiru? She's not here. Nia? Take the stairs. - What're you doing? What's wrong? - Come up here. Nia. What? Did someone jump? No one's here. Wait! Mika! It won't open. Why? Open! Open! Calm down. Let's find another exit. Calm down. That's..... It's the Mika mark? Why? I..... I know this place. When we were kids, we played explorer. We entered a strange building. But couldn't get out. And then..... After all, I can't get out. I..... I did something stupid. Mika? I'm... ...pregnant. I'd forgotten it. But when I knew I was pregnant,... ...I remembered. That woman and I... ...promised. Mika. You made a promise? When you got pregnant,... ...you promised to give it to her? Mika. Mika, no! Mika! The promise. No. I don't know. I don't know anything about a promise! Mika! Damn you? - Damn you. Mika, it's me. Where are we? What's going on? I don't know. What is this place? What? What's going on? Looks okay. What are they? - I don't know. Among those who don't realize they're dead,... ...and those who wander with regret,... ...some will do harm to humans. When that happens, we must fight. Stop talking nonsense. There's nowhere left for us to run to! We're screwed. This is where we jumped before! Here we go! We jumped from here... ...and we got out. I can't do it. You'll be a mother, right? The real reason to see you was... ...I've made a promised. When pregnant, you'd be the first to know. I promised you. Ready? Here we go! We're stuck. Until I carry out my promise, we're stuck in here. No way. Oh, no. It's gone. I don't care about your personal pain! Don't you dare involve the living in your regret! Damn you! Izumi! Izumi, run. I'll get her attention. What about you? After I do, I'll follow you. - No! I promise. A promise? If I make a promise, it's to my baby. I'll never hand my child over. You will never get my baby! The promise. Me? You too? Promised? Mika! Mika! Izumi! What on Earth did I promise? I can't remember. But... ...that woman,... ...she'll surely turn up again... ...to fulfil the promise. Along with... ...that horrifying hotel. The promise.
