All right, everybody get down! I said get down! Not worth the 12 quid an hour, old timer. Move it! Go! Move it! Open the door! Nobody move! Everybody out! Now! Move! Move! Move! You, get on the ground! All of you on the ground! Ladies and gentleman, you're New Yorkers. You know how this works. Two minutes! It's a beautiful sight. Yes, it is. Beautiful. All right. 2x02 Incognito Time to go. I'm out of here. Your job was to kill both of them. He'll be dead in five minutes. I did my job. You better make sure 'cause he's seen our faces. Do him. I don't know; You were here before I was... Cappuccino with soy, I ordered that. Hi. No, it was a short doppio with four full pumps of hazelnut. Four full pumps. I-it's Mary-Anne, right? It's Anne-Marie. I-I had a regular mocha with whipped cream... for Lance? - Just a second. - Excuse me! - This isn't soy. - Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Hey, Deedie, what's the problem? My pen stopped writing. Is my drink ready? "Luca"? I can't remember the orders. - I got it. Are you ready? - Yeah. Gordon back here, he's having a triple espresso, easy foam. Tammy-Lynn is having a green tea latte with soy. We got a regular mocha with whipped cream for Lance. Luca is having an unsweetened jumbo iced coffee. And Anne-Marie back here, she's having a short doppio with four pumps of hazelnut. That's four full pumps. And I'm gonna have four shots of espresso over ice with five sugars. Thank you! Of course. Can you make mine first? - I'm kind of in a hurry. - Oh, yes. Hey. I'm ten minutes away. Iced quad espresso, five sugars. Okay, bye. - Breakfast of champions. - Okay. Aw! Yes, yes. All right, triple espresso, easy foam, coming up. They got five million in cash from the Four Aces Casino in Toronto, close to eight million in German bearer bonds from a bank in San Francisco, and a half a ton of rhino horns from a warehouse in Pretoria. You know, contrary to popular belief, rhino horn is actually not an aphrodisiac. In case anyone was wondering. Well, now I'm wondering. We're talking three of the richest heists of the past decade, all conceived by the same mastermind. Kilborn... the man, the myth, the legend. Mostly the myth, since nobody's seen this guy. Maybe he's not real. Maybe he's a ghost. Ghosts don't end up at the top of the FBI's most wanted list. Kilborn runs his jobs from behind the scenes. He never gets his hands dirty. That's why nobody knows his identity. Nobody alive knows his identity. The RCMP busted a member of Kilborn's crew in Toronto. Guy confirmed he was on the team, that's all. Got shivved in prison two days later. Kilborn kills to stay invisible. We got chatter that says Kilborn's next score is here in Manhattan. He may be on the FBI's most wanted list, but he's on our turf. So we make sure this is his last job. What's the target? That's your job to find out. Without knowing what he looks like or what he's after. Eliot, we're good but not that good. I'm that good. I might be able to help you out. Eve Steele. She looks different in every photo. Yeah, it's part of her M.O. she's wanted out west for a series of heists, all pretty flashy, in more ways than one. She pulled this job in Phoenix, six weeks ago. Eve's a chemical expert... She used thermite on the armored car. Wow. You gotta admire her tradecraft. You and ATF both. They passed along a tip to us that Eve's working for Kilborn. This is the hottest lead anyone's ever had on him. Eve arrives by bus today. You'll be there to grab her... discreetly. Last call for boarding bus number... She's probably changed her appearance. No match so far. Jay, you got any more photos for us? Uploading now. You know, Carrie, she kind of looks like you. Though Eve's auricles are asymmetric. You been admiring my auricles, Jay? Well, that's nice to know. You noticed my eyes. Auricles are earlobes. You forget to turn your memory on this morning? I remember everything, Jay, I don't know everything. Although now I know you like my earlobes, which is kind of kinky. I got her, Al. Sending Jay a photo. - Firm identity. - Got it. Running identity match. Confirm. Target is Eve Steele. You're up. Hey, there. You look like you're new in town. How about I be your tour guide, huh? - Back off, jackass. - Aw, come on... Hey, Eve. I think you've made a mistake. Mm... I've seen your work, Eve. That armored truck job could send you away for a long time. I liked you better as a sleazebag. Play ball with us and we can help you cut a deal in Arizona. So... what brings you to New York? I'm big into architecture. Frank Gehry mostly. Things that man can do with a box. I doubt he can do much with the box you're gonna end up in. You'll do a lot less time, Eve, if you just tell us about Kilborn. What's a Kilborn? Now, let's talk a little bit about Arizona. We're cooked if she lawyers up. She's not gonna do that. She asks for a lawyer, Kilborn knows she's talking to us and he kills her. Eve's only goal right now is staying alive. Well, nothing in Eve's bag links to nefarious activity. No weapons or information on where she's going. Anything on her phone? No. No calls or texts to any numbers in the greater New York area. And no e-mails connecting - to anything here. - Well, she's here for Kilborn. There has to be evidence connecting them. Okay, at the bus station, Eve moved a box off of a red bag. Now, I thought she was just looking for her luggage, but why move the box when Eve's bag is black? A message. There was a name and a number. I got it. You got what? A message from Kilborn. Hi. Burnsy's upset we're not hitting it off. Oh, yeah? Well, I should cheer him up. Take him to this little party I'm going to at the Alcazar Hotel, room 3382, at 5:00 P.M. Doesn't sound like fun. Oh, the fun part is when I arrest everyone in that room and tell them it was because of you. He'll kill me. Who? Kilborn. That name didn't mean anything to you a minute ago. Look, Eve, we're going to the Alcazar Hotel with or without your cooperation. We have ways of protecting you. From Kilborn? Don't flatter yourself. Prison, Witness Protection, a monastery in Tibet, he will find me. Well, then I guess your only hope of staying alive is to help us catch him before he catches you. I don't know much. Honest. Have you worked for him before? I've never met him. He's a real cryptic kind of guy. But you knew enough to get instructions at the bus depot, right? That message directs me to the first meet-up. Kilborn only gives crumbs of information through the job. You never get the whole pie. When were you supposed to meet him? I don't think he shows till we divvy up the score. Oh, that way, no one can finger him if the job goes South. You get any other instructions? Just not to share any personal information with any of the other crew members. You can't rat out the others 'cause none of you know each other's identity. Smart. Or not so smart. Undercover? You can't go undercover. We don't even know who you'll be working with. That's the point. Nobody on Kilborn's crew knows each other. I show up at that hotel room, I'm Eve. That's risky, even for us. Okay, Al, you know I can do this. I can. Tell me I'm wrong. I hope you're not wrong. I hired you to be right. I'm going undercover on Kilborn's crew... as Eve. Who says, exactly? We say. Listen, Kilborn's crew is made up completely of strangers. I show up at that hotel room, I am Eve. Yeah, but what about Kilborn? He'll know... He hired her... you'll be dead the minute you show up. No, no... all of our intel says Kilborn doesn't show up until the payoff. I can handle myself. I can. Besides, I even look... kind of like Eve. Eliot, you want Kilborn, this is the best way. So, you agree? No, I don't. What? You don't look like Eve. - You're much better-looking. - Aw... Here's how it goes down. Eve's due at the Alcazar in two hours. We play it one step at a time. Carrie doesn't go deeper till we know she's in the clear. Anything hinky, we're done. All right. But I want eyes on her at all times. Put your team together. Thank you. You know who we're dealing with. Anything goes wrong, you won't see it coming. That's what I have you for. Hey. How's it going? Hey. Oh, just learning everything - I can about Eve. - Hmm. On a personal and molecular level, I see. Oh, that? Yeah, well, apparently she was a chemical engineering major in college. Wow, you're a pretty quick study. It kind of comes with the... the territory. So you just... You look at it, and-and... And, what, it just goes right in? Yeah, that's pretty... that's pretty much it. Wow. I can't even remember what my daughter wants for dinner tonight. Hey, listen, there's some stuff, uh... That we heard about Kilborn at the bureau. Some things he did to people who crossed him. Just be careful, okay? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. This is for you. A barrette? That's not my style. It's Eve's style. Okay, but no one wears barrettes anymore. Jay loaded a transmitter in there... it's got GPS, too... So we can follow and listen in on all you're doing. - You sure you want to do this? - Yeah. I've always been good at role-playing, in case you forgot. Believe me, I've tried to. Why? You make a very sexy pirate. Hey, guys. They're in place at Alcazar. Anything feels off, we pull you out. No need to be a hero. Since when have I ever tried to be a hero? Is this is a "You show me yours and I'll show you mine" kind of thing? 'Cause if it is, you're gonna be waiting a long time, but I bet you're used to that, aren't you? Who the hell are you? I can't tell you that. Don't you know the rules? Put that away. Pardon the discourteous welcome. We weren't expecting someone so refined. Mm. What's a-a five-letter word for "trout basket" starting with a... Whoa, um... Y-you're a... Y-you're a... sh-she's... What's the matter? Is it the first time in a hotel room with a woman? It's, um, a pleasure to meet you. - I'm... - No names. I'm not dying 'cause of your disregard for Mr. Kilborn's rules. I don't like this. Those guys are armed and volatile. She's doing great. How's the tracking from her barrette? It's a strong signal. Good. Uh, so, I-I hacked into the hotel's system, and, uh, all minibar charges are going to room 1243. But, get this... There is no room 1243. So what are we supposed to do, huh? Sit and wait? Do you roll over as well? And what are you? Like, the team masseuse or something? In your dreams. He's an irascible fellow, isn't he? Though I, too, am curious about your bona fides. Well, I'm the chemist. I mix things and cause mayhem. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Why don't you come over here and mix me a drink then, chemist. Sure. I'll make you a drink. What's your poison? Ah! Dinner. He's probably delivering instructions of some kind. Kilborn knows his crew's assembled. Well, he must be watching the hotel. Get me photos of everyone in the lobby. He's got to be nearby. Copy that. Oh. Friends? Play it. Who made you boss? Uh, right. Welcome. Great adventure and wealth await the four of you. But only if you do exactly as I say. You know what will happen to you if you don't. Your anonymity protects you, so I've assigned you aliases. They are, based on your order of arrival: Arnold, Willis, Philip and Pearl. Really? "Arnold"? You'll find boxes under the trolley containing all you need for now. A word of advice: Keep your identities close. They're your best friends. How'd he know we were all here? - Because he's watching us. - Apparently he's been watching Diff'rent Strokes, too. "All further instructions will come "on these phones. Next communication in the morning." I suggest we all head to our rooms and lay low for the evening. Well, you can come bunk with me if you care to, sweetheart. Let me clarify what I do, Willis. I create explosives, corrosive substances, poisons. Chloral hydrate. Even the smallest amount will create seizures, hallucinations, loss of bowel control. Four drops will kill you. I put two in your drink. Or maybe it was three. Here... let me do you a favor. This is the number for poison control. You don't look so good, buddy. Give me the number. Give me the number. Give me the number! I didn't poison you, numbnuts. Don't mess with me again. Excuse me. I'm going to bed now. Pearl... Is a bad-ass. Yes, Mr. Arnold, she most certainly is. I'm in. Morning, Jay. All's quiet at the Alcazar. You look into the hotel rooms? Booked by a dummy corporation out of the Caymans. I was, however, able to match the I.D.s of these three from stills Murray pulled at the hotel security cameras. Let me introduce you to Clay Stites, aka Philip. Born in Brixton, England, in and out of Europe's finest prisons. He enjoys booze, assault and armed robbery. His experience will probably make him team leader. Next up is Willis, real name Andy Fotre; Former army ranger. Dishonorably discharged five years ago for selling steroids. He has a long sheet, mostly for home invasion and assault. Total loose Cannon. And this guy? Tucker Griffin. We know him as Arnold. Has a lot of charges for online fraud and hacking. NSA investigated him for penetrating department of defense files, but couldn't get anything to stick. Tech kid's a whiz, but he's pretty green. Carrie will pick up on that and try to work him. - Keep digging. - You got it. All right, so I send the gas through the vents, we clear out the cash and we split. In and out in four Mikes. Any sign of heat... beat cop, police cruiser, unmarked car... We take hostages. A little collateral damage never hurt anybody. Well, hopefully it doesn't come to that. You lose your nerve in there, and I will put a bullet in you. Hey. We're all pros here, Willis. Arnold just wants to make sure the job goes right. One of us will receive our escape plan right before we hit the bank. Another one will learn our rendezvous point with Kilborn after we do the job. Why can't we just get all the info now? Because if I had all the info, I'd kill you three and keep the money. Everyone lay low until tomorrow. Don't forget your goodie bags. Get some rest. All right... bring your A-games tomorrow, huh? Yes... we have... Here. Oh. Well, this is, uh... this is a prototype. How'd he get this? Oh! Hey, that's, uh, sinister-looking. Please don't use it on me. I make no promises. Arnold, are you sure you're not in over your hacker head with all of this? I'm kind of nervous, yeah. Uh, this is, uh, my first time committing a crime away from my computer. Well, how'd you get on Kilborn's radar? Uh, hacked the wrong offshore account. - Mm! - Just my luck. Hey, um... How 'bout we look out for each other? - Willis and Philip give me the creeps. - Yeah. They kind of give me the creeps, too. Yeah. Carrie says the target's a Hudson Mutual branch on Chambers Street tomorrow afternoon. When does Kilborn show? He's got to get his money at some point. We're tracking Carrie. She'll lead us to him after they rob the bank. What about the customers and the employees in the bank? We can't risk civilians. Only NYPD plainclothes will be in there. This thing goes bad, the mayor's gonna have me overseeing parking meters in Staten Island. It goes right, you collar Kilborn. All right. Hey, Al, I got his finger. Whose finger? Kilborn's finger. At least I think it's his finger. - Um, you know... - Okay, Jay, - take a breath. - Right, right, right. So, I created a little random data program and looked into collateral crimes around the time of known Kilborn jobs... You know, stolen vehicles, unexplained homicides... anyways, came up with this. - A finger. - Kilborn's finger. Maybe. I found this dead guy, Bob Archer, who was involved in one of Kilborn's first jobs. This picture was taken off of archer's cell phone six hours after the port heist in San Pedro. It's possible Kilborn's blocking the photo. And now you want me to send out a finest message for a finger? Now I want to give you the finger... print. See, got this killer new software that can generate prints from photos. If we can match it to a print in the system, we got him. I like it, Jay. Keep at it. Look at this. Well, Serpico in the flesh. - You sure it's safe to meet? - Yeah. I took the N train to Times Square, picked up the A at Port Authority and took the 7 to the M3 bus and back down here... Mata Hari couldn't have followed me. You're enjoying this a little too much. No. Well, a little bit. "Upon my secure hour thy Uncle stole, with juice from cursed Hebenon in a vial, and in the porches of my ear did pour, the leperous distilment." Hamlet. Act 1, scene 5? - I was Ophelia in school. - Bet you got raves. Oh, speaking of poison, the gas you got from Kilborn, fentanyl. The gas that killed all those people in the Moscow theater. Oh, my God. So I replaced the fentanyl with halothane. It's a much lower level toxin, and it should knock the guards out. Okay. Remember, Jay's got you on audio the whole time from your wire, and Murray will be right behind you in a follow car. No. Kilborn is way too smart for that. You got to keep her back, as far back as possible. She can follow me on GPS, okay? Like I said, anything feels bad, I'm calling it. We'll pull you out. Al, you... you're my hero. I'm gonna put that on a T-shirt. The fact that the two of you are still not doing it is beyond me. Gents and fair lady, our chariot. Sounds like they're getting into a transport. I've got 'em on the move. Where are you, Al? They're rolling. Okay, I'm in the park across from the bank. Keep me posted. They're on their way. Aren't you afraid some witness is gonna... remember your hair? Watching out for me. Yeah. Yeah. Give me that. Kilborn said no personal items during the job. This? - It's a barrette, Willis. - I don't care. Oh, no. This falls out, it's got your DNA all over it. And I am not going down 'cause you can't follow instructions. I've lost her. No audio. Murray? Tracking's gone. I don't have her. No one wears barrettes anymore anyway, right? We're set in the bank. Okay, listen to me. Nobody's a hero today. The faster we let his crew finish the job, The closer we are to getting Kilborn and getting Carrie out of harm's way. Yeah. What do you mean the wire's gone? Willis tossed it. I've got no GPS signal. Hold on. It's Jay. Jay, talk to me. We got to find that van. Yeah. Hold on, hold on. I got something. Uh, Carrie very wisely gave me the number to her burner cell. If I can just find it. Hold on. Come on. Come to Jay. Come on. Yes, they're at 9th and 26th, heading downtown. I'm on my way. All right, they're about ten blocks ahead of me. I'm guessing ETA at the bank about ten minutes. Okay, stay with them. We're ready. Hope nobody wants to phone their mums. I'm jamming everything within 50 feet of the van. Kilborn wants to make sure our cells aren't traced. Um... I'm-I'm not feeling good about this. I'd be worried if you were, Mr. Arnold. What the hell just happened? - What? What is it? - I don't know. We just lost the trace on Carrie's burner. I had her on Varick, then she just vanished. Murray, you have a visual? Negative. Okay, if she was just on Varick, they got to be here any minute. We play it according to plan. Remember, no interference. Let 'em in, let 'em out. Wh-what are we doing? Are we turning around? Following Mr. Kilborn's instructions. He changed the target. What?! That's tactical suicide. The location he gave us yesterday was bogus. We'll execute the same plan. Okay, um... n-no. I'm-I'm not going along with this. You most certainly will go along with it, Mr. Arnold. Only the utility closet and counting room specs are different. You'll find new schematics under the passenger seat, so I suggest you study up. By the way, payday just got bigger. $8 million. Nice day to rob a bank. They should've been here by now. It's almost 4:50. The bank closes in ten minutes. Something's wrong. Jay, any luck? Nothing yet. I'm working on it. I'll find her, I'll find her. I think he switched targets on us. All right, Jay, get helicopters, traffic cops... Anyone with a badge... Looking for that van. They're about to hit something. Al, I hate to say it, - but if Kilborn did change targets... - I know. It means Carrie may have been made. What the hell? Burns says we lost them? Not to worry, boss. And we have no idea what bank they're about to hit? - Like I said... - Jay, this is not worry you are hearing in my voice. This is a very powerful - and very justified anxiety. - Like I said, you shouldn't worry because remember when I asked you to call in that favor for that cell phone/wi-fi grid from homeland? If I recall correctly, it involved getting the deputy director four very exclusive dinner reservations. Well, it's a good thing we got it. Why? You tracking a cyber attack? Not exactly. In this case, I'm tracking the sudden loss of cell phone service. You see that string of black pearls, boss? Each pearl represents an area of lost cell coverage. Which means? Which means reception's being knocked out sequentially across Houston, and I think Kilborn's doing it. So we follow the outages and we follow the van. Whew. Nice. So... do I get a dinner reservation? Oh, you... You get a... You get a protein bar. - Enjoy it. - Nice. Yeah, thanks. All right, tech boy, you're up. Wish me luck. Luck. Hey! Everybody get down! Not worth the 12 quid an hour, old timer. Move it! Go! Move it! Get down! Go! Move it! Open the door! I said get down! Nobody move! Everybody out now! Move, move, move! You, get on the ground! All of you on the ground! Ladies and gentlemen, you're New Yorkers. You know how this works. Now, I wish you no harm. But my associate here is salivating at the thought of butchering every last one of you. So nobody do anything dodgy. All right, toss all your phones. Every phone on the ground now! Now, we'd like a word with the bank manager. You, come. Okay, the outages stop heading downtown on Broadway around Broome Street. Check for reports of suspicious activity at any banks in the area. Copy that. Open the door. You sure you know which one it is? If memory serves. Here. Okay. Gas is moving. Two minutes! Time to get rich. Here. No reports of silent alarms or suspicious activity anywhere. I mean, I got a carbon monoxide alarm at a bank over on Centre, but that's it. What's that last one? Uh, some carbon monoxide detector going haywire. Where's the branch? On Centre between Broome and Grand. Carrie knows these sensors route through EMS and police channels. Get that out to units. She's sending up a flare. Time to go. I'm out of here! Your job was to kill both of them. He'll be dead in five minutes. I did my job. You better make sure, 'cause he's seen our faces. Do him. It's gonna be all right. Pearl, let's go! Let's go! We got what we came for. Let's go. Arnold! That was amateur hour with the gas. You took care of that guard, - yeah? - What do you think? Oh, come on, man. She blew his head off! What are we doing? We are ditching. Kilborn's orders. We leave everything but the money. Come on, come on, move, move! All the money from banks damaged by hurricane Sandy was kept here. They cleared it out. Took off in a delivery van. Nobody got plates. What direction was it heading? We're still questioning witnesses. Al, you there? Forensics just matched a fingerprint off of Kilborn's photo. Uploading to you simultaneously. Holy... Al, you seeing this? Arnold's Kilborn. Hey, unis found the van in an alley a few blocks away, torched. The burner cells were inside. No street cams. Of course not. So we have no idea what direction they're headed? Nope. Excuse me? Excuse me... can we get our phones back? I need to tell my ride to Fire Island - you're making me late. - Sorry, ma'am. We have to keep them for evidence. Everybody come claim your cell phones! Come on, come and get them. Come on. Come get them. I just hope Carrie's as clever as I think she is. My cell phone is not here. - Your phone's not here? - No. - None of these cell phones is your phone? - No! Come here, come here. All right. Carrie took her phone. Have Jay track it. Get me the location. I'm going after Carrie. Come on, let's go. So who knows where the meet-up is? It's not far. Let's load up and shove off. There. All right. So, Kilborn has one more demand. We toss our weapons before we meet him. I know, I know. Paranoia, right? There is no way I'm going in there unstrapped. He can't be serious. Listen, we-we've got the leverage here. We've got Kilborn's money. I'm not giving up my gun. I think tossing our pieces for a few million bucks is fair. How do we know he's not carrying? Yeah, that's right. What's a five-letter word for "trout basket" starting with a... That doesn't sound right. I-I hear you, fellas. But let's not make Kilborn upset. Angry beasts tend to bite. Five-letter word for "trout basket" starting with a... Whoa, um, uh, you're-you're a... We got what we came for. Let's go. Okay, look, look. No one will work for Kilborn again if he waxes us. Hey, we'll be fine. Whoa. Don't... Give up your weapons. Arnold is a cop. Hey, don't mess around, Pearl! What are you talking about? No, there is no way that this wuss is five-oh. I'm telling you, he's a cop. That is crazy. I am not a cop. I am the hacker. Okay, for all we know Pearl's the cop. I covered for her earlier. She didn't... shoot that guard. You weren't expecting me to give a loaded gun to a cop, now, were you? That's why you wouldn't let me shoot the guard. I would have realized they were blanks. I would've realized that you made me, huh? I designed those rounds myself, by the way. It sure was sweet of you to save me from that bullet. I'll be sure to tell your bosses that you deserve a medal. Posthumously, of course. And you could spare the guard 'cause he never saw your face. You came back with your mask on. Bravo, Carrie. I wasn't expecting you to put all that together. But you didn't expect me to make you in the hotel, now, did you? We didn't know you'd be on the team. I'm always on the team. And at that point, it was either walk away or improvise. And using you to fool the cops was way too much fun to pass up. So what am I now? Just, um... insurance? For your getaway? In the very unlikely case that your friends show up. Of course... I can kill you right now. Creel. Excuse me? A five-letter word for "trout basket." Cute. Now get over there... Throw your gun down, Kilborn! Let us drive out of here or I smoke her! And what are you, like, the team masseuse or something? Why don't you come over here and mix me a drink, chemist? Seriously, she is dead in three seconds if you don't... Son of a...! Aah! Son of a... Ah, I was wondering when you were gonna show up. Had a bank robbery to look into. Yeah. Plus there's a phone thief on the loose. Come on. I should've killed you when I had the chance. You know, Arnold the terrified nerd kind of worked for me. Arnold the master criminal, not so much. All right, let's go. It's gonna be nice having Carrie Wells back. Oh, I don't know. I'm gonna kind of miss Pearl. Bad girls have all the fun. I knew you'd enjoy being on the other side of a heist for once. For once? Think this is the first bank I've robbed? Give me a date, just a date. - So you can look it up? - So I can arrest you. I dare ya. You know when you dare me, you always end up buying me a drink. You want a drink? Sure. Why didn't you say so? I'll buy you a... I'll buy you two.
