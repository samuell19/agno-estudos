I don't share your idea of making Hélène an artist. I have very clear feelings on the subject and you shouldn't count on me to help you. Your sister, L. Doss. Hélène, of a fanciful disposition, loved the theatre ... ... and for the children of the village ... Hélène: Miss Nathalie Kovanko Dressed by Lucie Schwob (Claude Cahun) "Save mother ... save her!" "I beg you ... save her!" "Mama ... Mama!" Orphaned and without resources, Hélène decided to go to some relatives in Paris ... who hadn't yet been informed about about the tragedy. Uncle Michael, who hadn't succeeded in life, had been taken in by his sister, whose tyranny he suffered under. Uncle Michael: Nicolas Koline "Do you want some su ... sugar?" "Hélène, it's you! What a nice surprise! ... and how is your mother?" "Mother is dead ... our house burned down!" Madame Doss, a domineering and churlish woman, lived luxuriously and presided over an association of "good souls". Madame Doss: Mme. Jeanne Brindeau "Hélène would like to speak with you!" "Well, hallo, Hélène ... so you are passing through Paris." "No, aunt ... I've come to live with you ..." "You are my only family ... for my poor mother ..." "Well then, we'll see about that ... for the moment, go and rest, your uncle will show your to your room." "Jean ... it's your cousin Hélène!" Jean, the only son of Mme Doss: René Maupris "Who is that other young man?" "Mr. Girard, a friend of your cousin!" Girard: Sylvio de Pedrelli "How handsome he is!" "This evening I'll take you to a very exclusive club where the games are high-stakes ... I spend all my nights there." "My dear child, don't hesitate to confide in me ... I will try to make this house a pleasant place for you." Li, manager of the Chinese club. Li: Nicolas Rimsky "Dear Monsieur Li, may I present my friend Girard, who you may trust as you trust me." "I am willing to lend you that amount, on the condition that you return it to me, at the latest, in a fortnight." "Come and sign a receipt for me!" The next morning. "Aunt, can you give me a task ... I'd like to make myself useful!" "Don't worry ... don't imagine that I'll keep you here with nothing to do!" "Clean them well ..." "Who will get rid of that clumsy oaf!" While Aunt Doss sought only to humiliate Hélène, her Uncle Michel, to the contrary, was nothing but considerate. My dear cousin, It's with sorrow that I must inform you of the death of our uncle Alexander Doss ... none of us figure in his will. The entirety of his great fortune is left to Hélène Doss, for whom we are searching at the moment. "My dear man, I can't wait much longer ... I absolutely need the sum that I lent you." "Our financial situation doesn't allow me to support your extravagances ... but I have a scheme to propose to you .. read this letter." "Marry her!" "Oh, mother ... are you joking? You can't imagine me marrying that little twit ... what would people say?" "Allow me three weeks grace and I swear that you won't regret it." "Cousin ... allow me to present my friend Monsieur Li." Overnight, Hélène's existence was different. "Michel, come and take part in our game of dominos." "Monsieur Girard, may I ask that you no longer bring your friend." "He lacks manners and compromises the reputation of my club." "We must leave, old boy ... our presence causes, it seems, a serious stain on the good name of this dive." "The truth is that you're furious at seeing us winning ..." "Well, don't get smart with me ... I've not only found a way for you to get some money, but also a way to shut you up whenever I want you to!" "My dear.. you must marry Jean- he loves you, and you can show your gratitude." "Well, aunt ... since it's absolutely necessary, I consent." "And now, mother, advance me some funds ... I'm completely dry." "What does all that mean? ... oh, I absolutely have to know!" The marriage was celebrated as soon as legally possible. "Jean doesn't realize his good fortune ... you are delicious, Madame!" "Excuse him, please ... he's such an eccentric!" .. in regard to the inheritance: none of us figure in his will. The entirety of his great fortune is left to Hélène Doss for whom we are searching at the moment. "My poor girl!" "I sympathize with you with my whole heart, my dear child!" Second Part A year has passed. En route to the ball, Hélène remembered the unhappy days that she had spent during her marriage. "How beautiful you are today!" "I know why you have married me!" "You wanted my money? You have it! What more is there? Don't ever cross the threshold of my bedroom." "I won't consent to a divorce, at any price ... you can tell her that." "Nothing doing ... I won't budge!" "We're almost there ... get ready." "No fancy dress, Madame, could diminish your charms." "In half an hour, I will wait for you at my place." "Have you seen Girard? It's him who is disguised as Molière's doctor." "Take care, Madame ... the man who just spoke to you is dangerous ..." "Yes, my boy ... in an hour, I will have the fifty thousand francs that I lack!" "I have a plan ... and in a month, I will be a millionnaire!" "I hope that you won't forget your friend from the bad old days?" "Here is one hundred thousand francs ... I still need fifty notes." "How can I sleep soundly with such a sum?" "You're lucky to be a good-looking guy ... all the girls are crazy about you!" "... and what's more, you're rich!" "Take my disguise and mingle among the dancers ... I have an interest in being believed to be at the ball the whole time." "People will never take me for you if I don't have a penny on me!" "My darling ... you haven't forgotten to bring me what you promised?" "Today, I wasn't able to ... but ..." "Do you know who the man in that mask is?" "It's Girard!" "No!" "Yes!" "And now, I hope, Madame, that you won't refuse to listen to me." "Where were you? I've been looking for you for an hour!" "Uncle ... accompany me to the buffet." "Why did you leave me alone? That Chinese man continuously forces his attentions upon me." "I would very much like to know how that Girard has such success with women?" "Which women do you want to talk about? The old dowagers that support him?" "Look at all the women surrounding him ..." "What's wrong, Hélène .. your pallor worries me ... rest for a minute ..." "Let's leave ... I feel drained ... I danced too much!" "If I am found here ... I will be the one who is accused." "Madame, there's a man asking to talk to you ... a serious matter ..." "My friend Girard has been assassinated!" "Why are you telling ME this? Inform the police!" "I'm afraid of being accused of the crime ... and I'm innocent. Take pity on me ... save me ..." "Uncle ... take care of this man and do what is needed." "Let's go, that's enough. I will accompany you to your place." The prosecutor's office were already at the scene of the crime. "You may retire .. I will undress myself, but when my uncle returns, tell him to come and see me." "Yes ... have they found any leads?" "Suspicions have fallen on this Robin, who indeed seems to me to be a disreputable sort." "As for me, I think that a woman killed him ... he always lived at the expense of a certain kind of woman." "No, I don't believe that .. theft seems to have been the motive for the crime, because of the disappearance of the hundred thousand francs he was carrying." "No ... no ... it's impossible!" "What do you know about it?" "I simply meant that I don't believe that he had such a great sum on him!" "Calm down ... be reasonable, sleep soundly ..." "I'ill force you to give me that money ... I've got those letters of yours ..." "Wretch ... so you just wanted my money!" "Careful - it's loaded." "Don't come any closer ... you fill me with horror!" "You're a coward ... tomorrow, I'll redeem my honour ... but let me leave." Public Treasury - Ten thousand francs National Defense Bond In one year, the Paymaster General will pay the bearer 10,000 francs. "Don't burn that money ... it could be very useful to us!" "How would you like me to reveal the name of Girard's assassin?" "What does that have to do with me?" "But ... these letters ... this money?" "How ... you know?" "I saw everything!" "What do you expect from me?" "It's you that I want!" "Don't try to escape ... you are in my power!" "Hélène, are you asleep?" "What is it, uncle?" "I've become convinced that Robin isn't guilty, and I've asked the judge to let him out on bail." "You're right, uncle ... that man couldn't have committed this crime!" Tomorrow, at 3pm, I will wait for you at the 'Rising Sun' tavern. "This time, I am lost!" At 3pm the next day, uncle Michel obtained bail for Robin, against whom the law had found no evidence. "You must be hungry ... we'll stop at the next restaurant we come to." "Over there, that's the man who runs the nightclub ... in the basement, there's a gambling den ... I know him well." "... and some wine ..." "I absolutely must know, who is that woman?" "I beg you ... take it all ... but spare me!" "No, I love you ... I've loved you for a long time ..." "Let's be careful ... here, everyone obeys him blindly!" "We must save her at any cost ... go and get the police!" "No, never. Denounce me instead!" "Too late ..." "Follow me ... I will save you!" "It's her ..." "He arranged this rendez-vous, because he knew that I had killed ..." "Be quiet ... be quiet ... I know everything ..." "Look, Michel!" "For them, life .." "... for me ..." "Why?"
