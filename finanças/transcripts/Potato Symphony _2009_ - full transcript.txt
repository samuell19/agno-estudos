The reason we currently live with no aspirations, may be because of that uncomfortable memory. You can't. Please use the machine. The machine is broken! I waited 10 minutes before coming to you like this. That is not under my jurisdiction. I have the money and the bill. Why the heck do I have to wait forever? Huh? I've done this for decades! Why isn't it allowed now? Customer, the new machines were installed and the rules changed a bit. I'm sorry. Miss, I'm talking to you right now. I'm talking to you Miss, you're not even saying sorry to me. Are you looking down on me because I'm dressed like this?! Huh! Come here. Aiyoo. I want to live quietly but the world, f*ck. You bastard, it's because you don't know how to be flexible. Are you rubbing salt to the wound right now?! Who'll pay for this? Should we decide through rock paper scissors? Rock, Paper, Scissors! Rock! Ohh. Potato Symphony Alumnus, Choi Jin Han. Alumnus, Choi Jin Han, has handed out a scholarship. Whoa. 39 years old, a sad age. You're now one of the local influentials. Local influential? Not even. Of course you are one! You even gave out scholarships. You're definitely an influential person. Pssh. You're not touching any of the appetizers. Oh, I'm suppose to eat dinner with my wife and my sister-in-law, later. Sister-in-law? Hey! Leave my family alone, alright? You've a scoop from the school, right? Scoop my ass. At the sacred location where they were awarding scholarships? Bastard. There was a great man named Hyung Kwang. He invented fluorescent (Hyung kwang) lamps. Wasn't that Edison? That's right Ah, these idiots. Edison made the incandescent (Baek yeol) bulb, you idiot. Fluorescent lamp was invented five years later by the great Hyung Gwang Kim from Kangwon while he was studying in Japan. Then incandescent (Baek yeol) bulb must have been invented by Mr. Baek Yeol Kim. Are you a gold fish? How can your memory not last more than 3 seconds? I told you 3 seconds ago that Edison invented the light bulbs. Baek yeol (incandescent) is a common noun meaning 'white light'. Hyung Gwang (fluorescent) is a proper noun named after the great Hyung Gwang Kim. It is not the fluorescence that flickers. Do fluorescent lamps flicker? Huh? Do they flicker? If you don't know then you should just keep quiet. Why are you arguing? Have something to drink There was also the national pro boxer, first as a man from Kangwon. His name was Ju Meok (punch) Kim. What kind of story is that? The boxer was Punch Kim and fluorescent lamp inventor was Fluorescent Kim? Is it a cartoon? They were making such a fuss over sitting in the front of the cab seat. Why do you keep taking the front seat when you what would happen? The back is too suffocating. Change that habit! Proper wives don't sit at the front. What's wrong with sitting in the front. Look. You wear these short skirt The drivers all look at that. Is your thigh for public viewing? Brother in law you wanna an award for best thigh or something? Mr. Kim Dalgo have you heard that there is freedom in thighd? My beautiful thighs Let it just be. Okay? Just let it be?! Brother in law Yes. Watch your voice. Yes! Kim Dal Gu, you son of a bi*ch. When we've finally got a good atmosphere don't destroy it I did wrong. Hey. Yes? You don't know me? No I don't Aren't you a Bong Nae Middle alumni? You must've gotten the wrong person You're not 2:nd grade's 2:nd class' Dae Hee Song? N-no. You sat next to me, right? You're Dae Hee Song, right? Don't you remember me brat? Honey Let go. He's my friend. I was just happy to see you kid You remember me, don't you? You've got the wrong person, I'm not Dae Hee Song Are you pretending you don't know me You brat How are you my friend, brat?! Hit me all the time You also told me to steal money! I said I don't wanted it Hit me on the head with a brick What kind of friend is that you brat? Brats... You fucking idiot... I don't... Jeasus Please forgive his sin Donation to the school he had been expelled from I have a lot to learn from Chairman Choi... I thought to myself. That's nonsense. I know that president Choi Is an ambitious man I saw it at first look No It's a misunderstanding When you donated sholarship I was surprised. it was a pleasure He's out of his mind Do it Hey brat! What are you doing brat? Konck it off. What are you doing, brat? Today you're dead What are you doing, brat? I said knock it out, you brats! Come up brat You little bastard is finished Ahhh. when us 5 got together and beat the shit out of those guys. Wasn't that the best time of our school years? I know. Not just school years. The best time of our life. We got so much fan letters from the girls. They were saying how tough we were. We even had blind dates. We were awesome. Especially Baek Yi. Which bastard belittled Bong Rae High's Baek Eun Lee? He was literally in the middle of them. What was that bastard's name? Bong Su? Bong Su He walked out arrogantly and Baek Yi punched him in his head! He went out cold! Right. Hey why are you nodding your head for? He wasn't there when we were fighting. Yea. SangJin went with us. Why didn't you come with us? You ass. I was in classroom. In the third year, our schedule was different. This ass didn't even get in fight with us But he came excited to the firl's meeting. Excited? What are you talking about? WHat am I? A toad? Honestly how many did you hook up with? What are you talking about? You were putting a move even on my date, bastard. I didn't putt a move on anyone, you bastard. You did put a move on her, bastard. I saw everything. You hooked up with his date, too, didn't you? Brats You... Because I am from Seoul, you rednecks are trying to beat me up? Shut up an drink. Ah, drink more You're too noisy. Too noisy. Toast! This bastard knows how to rattle out of life. Cheers! Knows how to rattle out... Filthy bastard. By the way, what happened to Baek Yi? Is he alive? Ah, who knows. He went missing. I am sure he is doing fine somewhere. He was just fine when he was beekeeping after the army. He enjoyed looking at the stars at night. He looked very happy by then. Thanks to Baek Yi, we get together for a barbeque once a year. He is still our boss even after he is gone. I miss Baek Yi. All of the sudden, he lost his family and took on his brother's debt. Even his child. Poor bastard. Jeol Byeok. I am asking you this as a friend. Cut down on drinking. I am begging you. I am going to die like this. At least fucking eat something when you drink. You haven't touched it. I buried Sang Jin myself. Do you want me to bury you, too? Have some rib. Feed yourself well, okay? Why is Jin Han doing so well, by the way? Don't bring that up. You are ruining our drink. A friend of mine dies so early, when the scumbag gangster appears on news as a good person. I really don't want to go to Canada. Don't say anything and just go. I am saying this for you. No soul is free of wounds... We are approaching the home of Dong River, Jung Baek, Jung Baek Station. Casino Hotel, please. Hyeong (big brother). Coming. Hey. I met Baek Yi on my way here. Snake Head? Yes. Where had he disappeared to? He had been nowhere for a long time. Who's turn? nananananananana lalalalala lalalalala Song Ha. Wait for me at your great-aunt's house. Come home soon, daddy. Jjang Gu! Why is Jeol Byeok staying home? He is done for. Why? He drinks as if he doesn't have tomorrow. His life is no use. He doesn't let one day go by without drinking. He is a complete addict. He said his wife went to see his family. But I haven't seen her for a year already. His father was begging me with tears a few days ago. He was asking me to help him. You know he never listens to anyone. And in a way, he got what he deserves. So, he still wants to paint? It's too late, now. How old are we? It's over. He was so talented. No customers now? No. Is it good? It's amazing. I didn't have anyone to eat with. I went to the restaurant alone and people kept staring at me. Will you eat with me? Are you divorced? Let's talk about you. Men tend to think that they look mysterious if they don't talk. I don't fall for that. Quiet men are usually just empty-minded. I am speaking from my experience. I just become regretful after talking about myself. I am not trying to look mysterious. That's true. It does feel that way, doesn't it? Excuse me. Can we have a bottle of soju, please? Believing that smart students can get bad grades is denying the whole education system of this nation. It's a dangerous, radical leftism. Your father was a superintendent. How can you be so shamless, despicable and outrageous as his son? Hey. Despicable and outrageous? You are making a big deal about what I am saying. Yinokki was pretty cool when he was a school band master. Cool? Are you kidding me? He was just a little more noticeable from far away because he was heavy. I got a lot of fan letters from girls. You didn't know that, did you? What you mean we didn't know? You bought them really nice snacks for just writing a letter. You did get a lot of letters. I asked So Yeon to deliver my letter and got some egg cookies. Did you know that? What happened to you was a sad story from hungry days. It wasn't your nice techniques. Fuck. I should have fought him really good. You admitted that you lost. Let it go. Don't bring it up all over again. It's 20 years ago. Hey, Baek. Listen to me. It didn't end 20 years ago. -They are still... -Stop it already, Hyeok. Jin Han drives a Chairman. He also has his driver. When they have a year end party, I can't find a girl in town, because they are all invited to the party. Are you not in the mood for soju? Is that it? You think that's why I said it? These basterds are so loud. Why do you make a fuss about the past and ruin this time? Just drink. Drink. Also, Pickaxe kids have behaved well lately. They donated a scholarship to the high school. People keep on changing their behaviors. Do you know that? Joseon Tribune covered a huge interview on him yesterday. God damn it. I don't know how the world works anymore. Jeol Byeok and Yinokki are in the next room, right? They are hanging out everyday since Byeok showed up. That must have alerted the Pickaxe kids. What are you talking about? They already got crushed in the senior year. Is it ture that they got beat up by Jin Han? A big time. Baek begged them to spare their lives. It was so pathetic. So, you were there, too? Of course! I had a rough life, too. I am jealous. Clouds in the sky And friendship deepens... Do you want to play rock scissors paper for slapping? It's been so long. Past, past, in the past... Autumn goes by... and youth also goes by... Mom. Can't I just live here? You can't be serious. Aren't you ashamed? What will people say about you just renting out videos here? They say Superintendent Kim's family has totally gone down. Shut up, you jerk. That bastard won't fucking shut up. What an idiot. Watch me carefully. Though you won't get it. Hey you kids. I don't mind you playing billiards, but watch your language for other customers. Yes. I am sorry. He is Baek. Baek in Gwangsan? Sir, we are Jin Han's subsubordinates. Please take care of us. Alright. Go on with your game. Are you free this weekend? Just drink the coffee. What the hell, you asshole! He can't help it. This little bitch can swear. What do I do... Just leave. After I was released from the prison, I started living in Seoul with Jun Seok. I had no connection in Seoul. I only got bullied for coming from the urban area in Gangwon. I had no friends from hometown. When the casino was built, gangs came from everywhere in the country. Some from Daegu, some from Gwangju, and Suwon as well. We didn't know much so we acted like we were one of them. But, you know, it would be lame to be pushed around even in your own place. So, I gathered all my kids and kicked them all out. I don't know what you think of me. But I thought you were pretty cool. Am I paying today? You don't believe me. By the way, some of your subordinates were acting out. Can you tell them not to come to my billiard place? Which idiots? Give me names. They are dead. No. I don't want them to hate you. Just give a warning. I just don't want to see them. You changed a lot. The old you would've killed them yourself. Jin, you are really good. Would you like a cup of coffee? I'm fine. I don't do anything unhealthy. Call Jin Han. Go tell Jin Han to come here. What's wrong with you? Go tell your fucking boss that I want to see him. Hey, Hyeok, it's been so long. Jin Han. How nice to see you. I had a bad day, so I had some drink. But I don't have money. The lady was acting stiff. She doesn't know I am her boss' old friend. Hyeok, you had quite a few. Yes, I did. The world is ridiculous, so I had a few drinks. But I guess, it is a nice world for you, Jin Han. A gangster bastard got to be on the television news. That's fine. Put it on mine and let him go. I am the manager here. Don't come here again. Don't come again? Is this bastard talking down to me? You have to act like a senior to be treated like one. Bastard! Let go! What an idiot. Why did he kick someone else's ass when it was his wife who cheated on him. She didn't just cheat. She ran away. That still doesn't explain why he had to drink and fight at Jin Han's bar. Now he has been beat up by juniors from school. He is embarrassing. He is a shame of our hometown. What about the treatment cost? They will pay for it. And the members who hit him? Hyeok hit them first. So, they are not going to do anything about hitting a senior? I will talk to Jin Han. Kick his ass if he doesn't listen to you. Stop speaking nonsense. Think about how many subordinates Jin Han has. Idiot. You are pathetic. Why don't you be his subordinate? What? Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch? Do you want me to hit you? How dare you... Let this go. You follow me. Something is on your mind today. No. Tell me. Tell me. Living with people who know your past isn't easy. When I visit my hometown, I don't spend more than 4 days. 4 days was the limit. Until then it's nice and warm. But after that, I only hear curses. You should leave too. It's not fun to live like that at such a young age. You know the kid who got kick out few days ago. He turned out to be Cheongryangri's leader, Bulsajo's son. Jun Seok called us. He said Bulsajo is very upset and swears to beat up Baek Jeong and his followers. Bastard, I should have killed him. He suggested us to come to Seoul for a drink and talk with Bulsajo. Bulsajo is from Mokpo, right? I think so. He is Jun Seok's friend, then. Seoul, Can't go. Go stay with your family for a while. And don't let Ssat Byeol go outside. Honey, This is the last time. I will forget tomorrow. I will definitely forget. And put on heavy lipstick. Love doesn't last. It doesn't last forever. You don't want to call it a day, right? No. Just go. This is it for today. Do you like me? Yes... I said not to. I'll call you. Man, give me a pack of Marlboro Medium? We don't have any. Give me Red, then. I said we don't have any. You don't have foreign cigarettes? Don't try too hard and just smoke This, bastard. My taste is too sofphisticated for This. You are funny. Let's try to respect each other, please. Did you lose your fear because you became relatives with Jin Han? Fuck... What? Fuck? Bastard. Listen. I am not the old Dalgu who always got beat up by you. I am part of Gokgwangyi, now. Gokgwangyi, my ass. Fuck... Dalgu got beat up by Jeol Byeok? Right. Your subordinates are upset. You should send them. We will take care of Jeol Byeok, first. We are grown-ups. It is shameful to fight between friends. But this is our base. We need to stick to our rules here. And they are seeing everyday since Baek showed up. Of course, they are old friends. We know what they are talking about. It's obvious. Let's put things straight before it creates any rumors. Who still cares about what happened in high school? No, it is still a legend for the juniors. If they hear that our group was much bigger at the fight, it would tarnish their respect for us. It will just be Jeol Byeok. As a warning. I ran into him at the terminal. He was quite arrogant. -We have to change his attitude. -Jong Pil. Now is not a time for trivial problems. I heard that... Jeol Byeok beated up my sister-in-law's husband a bit. They wanted to hit Jeol Byeok but I didn't let them. They should know better. We are businessmen, not gangsters. I know. This is a tough time for both you and Jeol Byeok He has been there before. He should be more patient. And not walk around creating a mess like a savage. He has passed the age. He should be more serious. Tell Jeol Byeok to call me. Friends can talk it out. And also, from now on, I don't want to hear any rumors about Gokgwangyi. I just... trying to be a good father. Nothing more, nothing less. What? Make an apology? No, I mean, just give him a call and say you are sorry about what happened. That is an apology, you bastard. Do you want us to fight and run around at our age? Did kneeling become a habit for you? Are you suggesting we should be fighting at our age? Are we gangsters? Listen, Snake Head. Since my high school, I believed that you were the best among us, so I treated you as our captain and never betrayed you. When you kneeled down, I followed you with no question, because it was your decision. But see, I have been going down since then. Am I exaggerating? I don't care about those who went to Seoul. It's another world. But it matters in my hometown. Think about which ones are doing well and which ones aren't. We are still living by the hierarchy. Can you see? I guess you don't feel so offended because Jin Han treat you like a friend. I can't be friends with such a filthy bastard. Did you really think Jin Han was your friend because he gave you a few drinks at his bar? Hyeok is also really disappointed at you. Let's talk about it outside. Fine. Let's fucking go outside. You are actually really intimidated by Jin Han, aren't you? You kneeled back then not for your friends, but because you were scared, didn't you? You bastard! Fucking hit me. Hit me. I can't believe I liked being friends with you. We went to you and your brother's grave for gardening. We went every year to make a ritual. We've always been worried about you and wondered how you were doing. I know everyone likes to agree with rich people, but how can you do that with Jin Han, you bastard. I am sorry, Jeol Byeok. What are you doing here? What do you mean? Why do I feel that you don't like I am here? I heard everyhing from Jeol Byeok yesterday. You told him to apologize? What is wrong with you guys, seriously? You know what they are, now. We can't stand against them, and also have a normal life here. We wouldn't have had to worry about that if we beated them in high school. Right? You are blaming me, aren't you? I don't blame you. I don't expect anything from you anymore. You've grown so weak, Baek. You were so awesome back then. What happened to Yeong Mi? Did you hear from her? She left, because I am poor and lame. Why would she try to reach me? You two have been together since middle school. Yeong Mi liked you very much. Don't sell her as such person. None of that matters, you bastard! What do you know? Don't you read newspapers? Rich people get respect and poor people don't. Someone like Jin Han Choi does an interview for a newspaper. Did you see what he said? Good people will finally win. My wife told me to be like Jin Han Choi. So I beat her up. She wants me to fucking be like Jin Han Choi. Do you get it, you fucking jerk? She wants me to be like that scumbag! You fucking bastard. Relax. I'll be going. Hey, please let it go. Aren't you going to pour me a glass? I just got your text. Let's take a break. I will call you. Sorry. Hey, Jong Pil. Its been a long time. Oh, yeah. I heard you came down from Seoul to open up a billiard's parlor. Sorry I didn't come and see you. What can you do when you're busy. things going well for you? Come by. Okay. I'll see you next time. Hey, you. Tell your subordinates to behave themselves. I trust with that. Jeol Byeok. Don't swing your fist all over the place. You could end up dead, you asshole. Jin. What are you doing here? Stopped by to see a friend. Have you been looking for me all this time? I told you I came to see a friend. Let's go elsewhere. I just got out of sauna and was having a tea. You don't have to give me excuses. Excuse? Why would I need an excuse, huh!? Just who are you? then, don't lie! You're not my style, oppa. I like men with ambition. One who can be cruel. Sir, stop the car for a moment, please? there are two kinds of men. those ones who want to try flying and risking everything. And the others who wait and die like bugs. those bugs think they live good by crawling around And they think they are living well. When they are just crawling around and nothing more. Those people make me sick. Give me a pack of Marlborough. We don't have any. You should be well stocked if you're running a business. You SOB! Wait there. Fuck! What is this guy! Was it Jin Han? Let's go. Do you remember the first time you felt like you were dying? You thought you would feel alright after few days, but you end up living the whole life feeling that way. For me, that was when I kneeled to Jin Han, that bastard. Me, too... Have you ever thought that we are bugs crawling on mud? If we are bugs, we are bugs with a big pride. Thank you, Jeol Byeok. I should thank you. What are you? Arggh. What is this? Arrgh. Ahh! Ah! Ahh! Did you send the guys? Ahh. So far no death from the fight but 18 wounded. Six of them in hospital for 6 weeks. 12 of them with minor injuries. Two from the opposing side are in hospital for serious injuries, and the number on our side spared useful at the moment is three who survived the fierce battle, unimpaired six who didn't fight, All together, 9. To be prepared for the case of Bulsajo's attack, new recruit is urgently needed. Baek and Jeol Byeok beat the hell out of Gokgwangyi. They didn't beat the hell out of them. They are also injured and hospitalized. Hey, two won against twenty. That's beating the hell out. Well, Cheol Hwan also has beaten twenty Namsan Tech High kids in the past. How can one person beat twenty, you bastard? Is he Sirasoni? You idiot. You have no idea because you haven't had an actual experience. Hey, what happened to you guys? What do you have on your head? This? I was fishing at a river a few days ago, and a stone was thrown at me. Where was that? You know the reed field near the rail way. Two came flying at me within ten seconds. Hey, I think it was two skanks. Two. Whoever that fucking bastards are I am going to... It is over. We didn't even get to see Jin Han and Jong Pil's faces. We should've called them first. If you combine all three of us, it is 22 weeks in hospital. Do I have to live like this, when I am almost 40. Bastards. You could've waited just few weeks for me. This bastard was all serious and said, 'let's go'. No, let's wait till Hyeok gets his cast removed. How do I say that? It would've been only two or three week, if I only didn't go to his billiard parlor. Nice job not convincing your friend out of a fight. He was more excited than I was. You have to pick a right friend. Or you will end up wearing a cast your entire life. Entire life. Jin Han. I don't think we are in a good shape. Why? Our high school manager got beat up. Since the Gwangsan raid, the local sentiment is getting worse. We receive a lot of interference. Boss, Deodeok was hit by a non-gangster. What kind of bastard is it? He is a master at the mixed martial arts gym across the road. What happened? He accidently spitted on his pants. Hello. Can I have a cigarette? You were here, too? Yes. Did I do this to you? You were the first, and then one more time by Jin Han on the same day. Give me a cigarette. Give me a cigarette! Smoke This, Dalgu. You are also a son of farmers. Okay. I am sorry, Dalgu. Boss! Boss, thirty minutes' up. Cheers. Bottoms up. That bastard. Jin Han Choi... Is he here? I am Jin Han Choi. Why don't you sign up for Domin Tribunes. Free subscription for the first three months. Chairman Choi. Call Jun Seok. I am going to Seoul. Is it because of your daughter? She needs to be going to school. What kind of book is that? The kind that studies your soul. Do you want to try? Don't worry about me and take a good care of your father. I said I am good. I just got your text. Let's take a break. I will call you. Sorry. Let's go to karaoke. I am paying. I am feeling too down right now. I will call you later. Maybe at 3 A.M. Hehe. Do you want to eat with me? All we have today comes from our soul in the past. It all came from our soul and the soul made them come true. I think we should go one more time. We will win this time. My son made a mistake, didn't he? There was a misunderstanding. I am sorry. It was taking you so long so I was thinking I should visit Jeongbaek. I should've come earlier. I know I am late. You must've been busy. It is a far way, too. I ask for your generous forgiveness. I just realized. You are very tall when you are sitting down. Jin Han. I ask for your generous forgiveness. Forgiveness counts for priests. We should be precise on give and take. Are you ready? Stop the car. Hey, Myeong Hak came back and got himself a studio in a closed school. Let's visit his studio sometime. Myeong Hak? You bastard... How did you think of using this space for your studio? Nice to see you. Nice to see you. It's been so long. We always call him Genius Boy. Oh, the teacher who was always drunk? That's right. He was an addict. His name was Chi Yeol Oh. Right. That's right. Chi Yeol Oh. I wonder how he is doing. I hope he didn't kill himself already. This is called digital book. It is an interesting concept. It is. They are lighting books. Um, it is an artwork. You are not supposed to touch them. Hey, Jin Han. I came to pay you back. Let's roll. You are so pretty. Cheers. I won't make you kneel. It's too cruel between friends. Snake Head. Can an expelled student attend reunion? Epilogue: You can find everthing you need within yourself. It has been a year since the combat and we had quite some change. Baek left hometown again and Jjanggu took over his billiard parlor. Jjangu is a younger brother of Sang Jin who died during the expedition led by Baek. Yinokki move to Canada as he planned. Hyeok sold his truck and opened a toast cafe. The blessing from his first love, Seo Jeong, is already becoming a nineth grader. Jin Han retired from the gangster world and started a business in rafting. He built a beautiful house in a beautiful place where he lives with his beautiful wife. Jong Pil succeeded Jin Han and became the chairman of Gokgwangyi. When Jeong Hee Park was cleaning up gangsters, my grandfather was imprisoned, and when Du Hwan Jeon made a correctional facility for gangsters, my father was taken. Everytime my family picked themselves up and has established a basis to live on, they were persecuted by the government. They had to start from mending all over again. Ladies in the family also endured tough times for generations. After Jong Pil became the head, Gokgwangyi members decreased to one fifth. On the day my friends went for a revenge combat, I left for a very long journey. I walked and walked like a mad man. Walking everyday and all day makes you think about many things. By the time those thoughts fade away, memories of vain past start rising clearly. It is when the distinction between truth and excuse becomes clear. I remembered the special day when I first had soju on a riverbank by myself. On that day, my father had burned all of my art supplies. Even now, when I sit in front of a furnace, I can smell the scent of burning oil paint from that day. I stayed on the road for seven months. I completely washed away the dream of becoming a painter that has been in the corner of my heart like burnt firewood. I don't think I can make great paintings like Myeong Hwan does. I am preparing a novel instead. The friend who told me that my talent in crafting lies even in the saddest moments would make a good novelist was Baek. Dong Rae High School's 10th reunion was held ten days ago. Yinokki flew in from Canada to join. He was just the way he was when he left. This reunion had more new faces than ever. The expelled student was there. And even the one who hasn't even entered came, too. I will talk about Jin Han shortly. Jin Han from my memory was right-handed, but he had become left-handed. From the moment I heard that Jin Han went to the combat alone, I started feeling somewhat indebted to him. I came to believe that people change, but I still believe that they also don't. All of this story has been written from Gwangsan Jeol Byeok's point of view. Dedicated to my hometown friends...
