We've tried to recruit for days He is the only one with real martial arts skills He wants to see you Since you are a knight, please take a seat This seat is vacant You must know the purpose of our recruitment, to expel the Jin and recover the territory On the other hand, it is also to avenge father Simply put, you need a group of fearless people To fight the Jin soldiers to the death Are you willing to take on this heavy responsibility?

I don't want to risk my life for you for no reason If you don't want to, then get lost You're not a citizen of the Song Dynasty Don't be disrespectful We are also people who have lost their homes and havenâ€™t much money with us We have no authority to offer you a high rank position. I don't care about high positions or wealth. What I want is you What did you say? I've been wandering for many years But I still haven't found a wife What I wish is to marry you Damn madman Don't be impolite This girl is quick and ruthless. Eight darts in a throw There's one more here. Bravo! Nothing special But I can still compete with the Jin soldiers. Sister, marriage is a big deal. It's not a joke. I promise to marry you. But I have conditions too. Let's hear it. I want the head of General Wan Yan. To be offered before my deceased father's spirit. Only then can we get married. I came to seek revenge on you. I didn't expect to avenge you! Ha... What's your name? Jin Shan-Kuo Miss, don't worry. No matter what, you won't marry that barbarian. As long as he can bring back Wan Yan's head to avenge my father Chun Mei, is his martial arts great? High martial arts skill, low character. Who? It's me, Wang Fuon Uncle Wang, is there something? Miss, please forgive me. I'm afraid I've erred. Jin Shan-Kuo is a fugitive. What grudge does he have with my father? He killed the Premier's son He was sentenced to death by General Zhang, but he escaped. I don't know how he ended up here. It doesn't matter. What do you think of his martial arts skills? Rarely seen in a hundred years. Then let's make good use of him. But he wants to marry the miss. Having avenged my father I have no attachment to the world. He won't marry a dead person. Lady... Our miss is the General's daughter. What are you? A murderer and fugitive. You're not even worthy to speak with her You actually want to marry her? You're really a shameless guy Have you eaten a lot? Are you done cursing? If you're done, please leave. If there's no more nonsense, continue. I'm going to sleep. Have you finished? Tolerable It's this guy, annoying and troublesome. I want to discuss something with you. How can we obtain Wan Yan's head? That's my business, don't worry about it. I can give you some information Wan Yan has four Generals Known as the Four Heavenly Kings, each with strong martial arts. The first one is Fan Tong. He is cunning and ruthless, with excellent lightness skills. He is a famous assassin under Wan Yan's command. General Fan. I think I'll send you to investigate Zhang En-Zhu's whereabouts. That's your specialty. We must capture her. I heard that girl is quite good-looking. The second one is Hung Tu. He has immense strength and is fearless. But he lacks intelligence. General Hung, take some soldiers Go to the Four Villages to search for gold and jewels. If you can find beautiful women, that would be even better. What if there are neither girls nor treasures there? What's the point of that village then? Alright, then I will burn it down The third one is Har Cha. He is Kuan Yan's right-hand man and never leaves his side. To kill Kuan Yan, we must first eliminate him. General, what mission do you assign me! Your duty is to guard me The fourth one is Na Sha. He has a skill called Blood Sand Palm, which can strike through walls. Quickly Master Jia, the General has something to say. Tell him to wait. Didn't you see me practicing? The General said there's an important matter. Get out of here! General... Out, all of you! Master, please take a seat How is your Blood Sand Palm training going? It's about 90% complete Very good, now don't you think we should continue to advance But there are still a few things to take care of Zhang Zhe is dead His daughter's whereabouts are unknown, it's a concern What should we do?

If I want to leave, who can stop me? Wait ten days If I don't die, I will bring back the head of Shu Wanyan Will, you go alone?

I want to marry without a dowry. You... What do you want? Let's talk. They asked for... your head. General Wan Yan, please cooperate. Lend me your head. Hold! Na sha! It's me! Look here! Thank you, Master After him! He's hurt. He can't run far. Dad, please bless us in heaven Uncle Wang, how many days has Jin Shan-Kuo been gone? Today is the seventh day. Why is there no news at all? Did he escape? I'm more anxious than you. I've sent someone to town for news. My lady, Mr. Jin... - What happened? - He, he was killed by that Na Sha. Did someone see it with their own eyes? Is it true? The news came from Jin's army camp. Jin Shan-Kuo killed Hung Tu on the way. Then a person broke into Wan Yan's tent late at night. He was almost successful But he was hit in the vital point by the Blood Sand Palm. He is indeed a brave warrior. It happened last night. He might have died on the way back. Dad, tell me. Who else can I ask? Let's not give up, there is still a glimmer of hope. I heard that Lu Ba is causing trouble at Wuli Peak. I'll call on him Many knights have gone solo, We should make contact with them Since he is an old hero, please let him in. Certainly. Miss Zhang, you don't know me. I've been looking for you for a long time. May I ask for the name of the heroic guest? Under General Wan Yan, there are four great generals. I am Ghost Shadow Fan Tong. Kill him Anyone dares to make a move, I won't spare her. My lady, tell them stand aside Who are you? Tell him to let me through. I'm a messenger. Attack! Has he still fever? No. Hasn't he woken up yet? It's not too hot, you can feed him. He's is sweating a lot, he probably won't die. It's not that I can't die, it's that I don't want to die. You're awake! I can't bear to die. You almost couldn't marry your wife. You've been unconscious for three days and three nights. I will have words with Wang Feng. He did not warn me that Na sha has Blood Sand Palm technique. Well, where is Wang Feng? General Wang has arrived. Wang Feng, did the wind blow you here? General Wang General Wang General Wang General Pang Don't call me General Pang I'm the Mountain King now. Just call me Pang Ba. What about it, do you want to join us? General Pang I told you not to call me General Pang. In my mind, you will always be a general of the Great Song Dynasty. Although you are a defeated general. You should not forget where you came from. Don't talk about that. It is just upsetting. What exactly are you here for? I want to ask you to join us Raise the banner of the people again, let's fight side by side. You only have one arm left. What's the point of talking about fighting or not fighting? They can cut me to pieces, I'll never give up The General's daughter is gathering people at Lu Zhuang. Preparing to fight the Jin army. General Pang, for Song Dynasty Lead your troops down the mountain. You ask them, who will go with you Gentlemen, Are you happy to become bandits and be despised for thousands of years? General Pang Who called me General? Don't come here to sow discord. If you're willing to stay, we'll take you in. If not, get out of here right now. Pang Ba, it's not shameful to be defeated. What's shameful is that you've become scared of the Jin army. Wang Feng, if you talk like that again... I shall take your other arm! Hurry up and put on your clothes, don't catch a cold. Is the lady sleeping? You're always thinking about her. Jin Shan-Yao, don't dream the impossible. You must know you're no match. But she personally promised me. Why do you have to marry her? Is it just for revenge? You have to admit Your lady is beautiful But she doesn't like you at all. I don't care, I want her. Choosing a wife is a lifelong matter. You should marry a girl who is your match. The most important thing is that she likes you. I've always been disliked by people. No one has ever liked me. At first, I disliked you greatly. But slowly, I stopped disliking you. It seems like you never look at me directly. Take a closer look. I have a bad habit. I'm not sure to like someone who likes me, but I must like someone who doesn't like me. You'll never be able to have her in your life. Why didn't that Na Sha kill you Donâ€™t' go yet. I need your help with something. I asked you to look at me before. Why are you staring at me now? This is my bad habit. You're here again. We are doomed to meet each other. How's your nose? Is it better? Can you go to another place? Look, my business is ruined. No problem, only if someone trouble me Even if it's a little, it's still business, right? Come on, give me two jugs of wine He didn't die? That's right. Did you see it with your own eyes? I saw him with my own eyes. He's drinking in the restaurant. This time, I'll make sure he dies. Master, should I report to the General? Get some more men to go with you Unnecessary. They'll only make trouble. We've been here for a while, shouldn't they be here by now? Master, I've missed you these days. I was just about to visit you. Leave. Please have a seat. Probably haven't been close to a woman in your whole life. But you can always have a little wine! Trivial tricks, don't show off in front of me. I've been wanting to test you, go ahead and do your best. I dare not, I've come to learn your Blood Sand Palm. No wonder you've recovered so quickly. Your internal strength is not bad. Sit down, I have something to tell you. Then talk right now I've never encountered a worthy opponent in my life. Being able to spar with you today, I feel it's worth it. However, don't plan on leaving here alive. I came here with no intention of staying alive. Show me your palm. I'll let you die without any regrets. Kill him! Your turn, girl. You don't touch women, but I'm getting married. Na Sha We have eliminated three of the Four Heavenly Kings. But there are still thousands of people under Wan Yan Zheng. With just us, we can't risk launching an attack. How many people are there under Pang? From what I know, there are about a hundred people. Most of them tend toward us except Pang. Uncle Wang, I want to meet General Pang. My lady Even if I go, I might not be able to persuade him. But everyone is shedding blood and sweat. I may not have martial arts skills, but I should contribute my part. Is Wuli Peak ahead? Probably! Hey, you're guarding the lady, I'll go ahead to scout. No point riding into a volley of arrows. Would you like to take a rest? How should I address you? Call me whatever you want I've wanted to thank you for a long time Regardless of your intentions or what your purpose is I'm very grateful to you You're not marrying me just to get revenge on my father, are you? If that's the case, you'll live your life in hatred I hope you won't. I'm willing to repay you for the rest of my life This mountain is mine Those trees were planted by me This mountain doesn't concern you Those trees were not planted by you General Gan, do you know me? Lady Surprising to see you here, lady But I can't go back I have no face to go back General Pang, we need you I know I know, I understand The Jin army is trying to capture me, they want my head. Song regards me as a rebel. Even if I go back, what then? You can redeem yourself through your achievements Drive the Jin army out of the border You will be a hero of the country I'm not brave enough. How many soldiers do you have? I only have about a hundred people here Can you take on thousands of Jin soldiers in battle? You! Wang Feng is right about your being scared. You...! So this a great general of the Song Dynasty? Shan-Kuo! Enemies roam freely in our land, and I can do nothing. I can only do what heroes do. Offer my head to the enemy. Take the opportunity to kill Wang Yan. For our country's sake, to avenge General Zhang. Even if I, Pang Ba, die, I have no regrets. Pang Ba's final words. An extraordinary general, a great hero. Sure! It's Pang Pa Still not ready to die, Chang? I killed him with my own hands, so there's no mistake. You finally know what's good for you. Thanks to master's blessings, I hope I can secure a good position. You won't be disappointed. If all the people of the Song Dynasty were like you, we would already rule your country. Is Miss Zhang at Lu Zhuang? If the master doesn't believe it, I can show you the way. How many are there? There are probably about twenty men and women. Is there a man called... Well, what's his name? The messenger. Right, the one called messenger? I never heard of any messenger Lu Da Kang is the strongest one there. Pang Ba, you, who else is left? What's so special about Lu Dagang? Don't let them slip away. Let's go now. Wang Feng, you lead the way. It seems like there's no one in this village. Burn it when we come back. Climb to the tower. General, they're hiding in this temple. General, this is the person you're looking for. Yes, yes, yes, it's her. Look, she's more beautiful than a painting. Wang Feng... Little lady, take this. Fight! Fight! Beauty. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful... Prettier than a painting Dad! General Wang, where is Jin Shan-Kuo My lady... Miss, Jin Shan-Kuo... Lady... Jin Shan-Kuo wants you to take care. Where is he? He is gone!
