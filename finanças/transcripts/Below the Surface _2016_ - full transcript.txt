There's nothing like descending on a shipwreck. It's like uncovering a mystery. Who was on board when she was swallowed up by the sea? What were they doing when it happened? And most importantly, why did they go down? Most people never expect bad things to happen to them... until they do. And then, it's usually too late. On the night of April 9th, 1942, a Norwegian merchant ship known as the SS Benwood, was on a routine voyage to Norfolk, Virginia when rumors of German U-boats in the area forced the ship to travel blacked out. At approximately 12:45 a.m., a black object was sighted off her starboard. She was on a direct collision course with another freighter traveling under the same conditions. The Captain made a last-minute ditch effort to save it by ordering the engine full astern. But the roaring of the motors alerted the German submarine and now the SS Benwood lies under 60 feet of water. They've been down there too long. We should call somebody. They'll run out of oxygen before help arrives. - Then we should go down. - Don't worry. Cameron is a pro. Come on, here we go. Help me! Move! Everybody give me space. When I give the order put this in her mouth. Ready? Come on, now. Move. Go. One, two, three... Sit up. Hey. What are you doing here? I was thinking that maybe we can go out for diner. I made a reservation at your favorite Italian restaurant. That is so sweet, but I'm exhausted. One of my students almost drowned today. What? Seriously? What happened? She got stuck under a beam and I had to drag her out. Uh... You need to be careful. It would kind of suck if you drowned. We've gone over this, more likely someone will shoot me with a gun. Yeah, but you're a diver, so drowning happens. Yeah, but I'm the best diver so... Oh! - See you later. - Bye, baby. Wow, this looks amazing. What are we celebrating? Why we gotta be celebrating? 'Cause you only cook for me when we're celebrating something. That's not true. I cook all the time. No. Name the last time you cooked. Let me think... Um... Wait a second. It's ok, it's ok. Don't think too hard. I love you. Superbowl Sunday. What? You asked me the last time I cooked. Superbowl Sunday. The BBQ? Burgers and hotdogs. Well, you just proved my point. You only cook for me when it's a special occasion. You're right. And I should have done this a long time ago. Oh! What's this? It's nice. Open it up. Oh. Oh, my god! You're my true north. Do you like it? What? The ring. Yes, I like it. I'm just worried about how you can afford it. I have some money saved up. How much? Lots. Hey, you know I have to go to work. Let's get married. Ok, I already said yes. What are you talking about? Today. Let's go to the courthouse and do it. Why today? It's about time that we get married. Yeah, but what about the dress and the party? We can do that later. Ok... No, not ok. I can't. - How come? - My sister. I need her here. Really? Is that really necessary? Do you have a problem with my sister? Yeah, she's going to tell you to get married in her house in Kentucky. I love Kentucky. I'm not getting married in Kentucky. Well, I'm not getting married today. - Have a nice day at work. - Um, hmm. I don't get it. Okay, do you have your ID, sir? Thank you. Alright, do you have any weapons on you? - No. - Alright, have a good day. These are the last of them. There's gotta be a mistake. We've gone over them a hundred times. There's no mistake. Well, I know Shane. He wouldn't do this. He did do it Kell, it's right here. It's unbelievable. I'm gonna talk to him. Wait a minute, listen... I know you still feel sorry for him, I understand... but this is really serious. We need to go to the police. We're not gonna go to the police. Here's what we're gonna do. Save these on an external drive, hide them somewhere safe and don't tell anyone. - What? - Please. Are you kidding me, Kell? The truth just stinks. You know what I mean? I mean, put it this way, I never cheated on her. You know, these times tables are all in whack. I need to get me a realistic ETA on this contacted captain. Shane, you got a minute? - I'm kind of busy, can it wait? - No. Man, I have a real tight window here. I need a quick turnaround. Can you do that for me? Yep. You got it, boss. Alright, thanks, buddy. What's up? Six containers missing from last quarter's report. Yeah, that happens all the time. A lot of times companies over report the amount of containers they're sending before they're actually shipped. Obviously we forgot to go back and adjust the numbers but I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. The thing is I do worry about it so I pulled up the old custom forms from storage, you know to try to sort things out, and I discovered that several containers have gone missing every quarter since you've been in charge. Like I said... On the days of the missing containers so are the original custom forms. All I could find were Xeroxed copies with the numbers changed. Kelly, it's really not such a big deal. Not such a big deal? We're talking millions of dollars in goods that have disappeared. Who is this hurting? The insurance companies cover it. Sure, but It's still illegal. Kelly, you know me. You know I'm not a thief. But this is more complicated than you think. So please, just let it go. How can I possibly... I can't, Shane. I want to help you, but I can't do this while I'm in charge. Okay, okay. I'll make it stop. Just give me a couple of days to figure out how. Can you do that for me? You have 24 hours. If one more container goes missing, I'm turning you in. Hey, it's Shane. There's a problem. Call me when you get this. I'm so glad. Keep it. No, Shane has nothing to do with it. I'll let him know. He's here right now. I gotta go. I love you too, bye. Hey, it's my sister, she said she loves the book you sent her. - That's sweet. - What did you get? I'm starving. - What's up? - It's probably just work stuff. I'll call them later. They forgot the soy sauce. There's some in the fridge. I'll grab it. Thank you. Hello? Alright. I'll be there in about an hour. - Yes... - I gotta go. - I got an emergency. - Now? Yes. It's work. Okay, well take some food with you so you can have it in the car. No, I'm not even that hungry, but thank you. I'm sorry baby, I gotta go. Look... I told you I sent the check last week. I don't know, maybe it got lost in the mail. Look, I'm in the middle of something right now. I'll send it again when I get home. Tell Bella I said hi. How's she doing? Internal bleeding, broken bones, and major blood loss. Will she make it? Fifty-fifty. They'll run some tests and call us if she regains consciousness. Do we have an ID? Her name is Kelly Jacobson. We found her purse in the car. Let's get forensic's to do an evidence check of the vehicle and her body and send me the details of the tire tracks. How about doing some background work? What are you doing here? That's not the right question, the question is, what was she doing here? This is a closed crime scene. If we find anything we'll let you know. Thank you, officer Ortega, but the day I need your permission to do my job is the day I'll retire. It's Detective Ortega, and this must be a real slow news day for you to be pestering me at this hour about a hit-and-run. Hit-and-run? Is that what you call this? Where are you going? What's she doing? Tire tracks that head straight towards the victim's footsteps, no sign of swerving or even breaking, in the middle of nowhere? Someone tried to kill this woman and if you can't see it, then you're either too stupid or too drunk to notice. You must really have some really big "cojones," coming here and telling me how to do my job. Get her out of here before I do something I regret. It's okay. I know how to walk. Pull the vic's phone records. - Hey... - What are you doing down there? Nothing. What happened to you? It's just... nothing. What do you mean nothing? Look at your face. I got jumped, late last night. They took my wallet and my car. Oh, my god! Are you, okay? Did you call the cops? Yeah, it's fine. I'm just gonna need to borrow your car. The day started out like any other... Kelly Jacobson was getting used to her new position as head accountant at the international freight company. A promotion she had worked for, for a very long time. That same night, Kelly drove out to this place. No one knows why. She waited here, outside her vehicle, to meet with someone. But instead, was run over by a car that later fled the scene. Now, Kelly is here, at Jackson Memorial Hospital, fighting for her life. Police are investigating this man, Shane Allen King. A long-time manager at the company who also happens to be Kelly's ex-boyfriend. What do you want? An applause? It's a cut and paste job, a five-year-old can do it. Insert the reactions of the freight company employees and add the part where the PIO says they thought it was a hit-and-run. I have to split. When you're done add my sign off and hold it until I say it's ready. Yes, yes. I need to report a crime. Yes, I'll hold. What are you doing? Hey, Maria, that's company information. You can't take that. Hey, I'm talking to you. What's the hell going on? Maria! Where the hell are you going? Hey! Maria! You don't know who you're messing with! Stop! Hey, where's everybody going? Alright, everybody, settle down. Fall in, fall in. Yes, it's true. I am retiring. I know what you are thinking, "what's the difference? Right? Well, the difference is I'm... I'm gonna be spending more time playing solitaire at my home computer than here at the office. Hey, this has been one screwed up career, I'll tell you that. I came up to this department straight out of Nam. Back then, there wasn't much difference between Saigon and Miami. Drugs, prostitution, murder. There was so much cocaine floating around the city I am surprised anyone has survived. I'm sure you heard all the stories about how I took down the cartel and put an end to prostitution, and cleaned up the streets. But the real truth is I couldn't have done this by myself. I have a great family and an amazing wife. Then I got you guys. Anything else? Then we have the boys who didn't make it. Bobby Black, Tony Collins, Ricky D... I carry their pictures every day around in my wallet along with an inscription that says, "A coward dies many deaths, a dying man, only dies one." Alright, well that's enough, go back to work. I'm not gone yet. Thank you. Thanks for your attention. Hey O. Wow, man. Welcome back. Are you alright? Oh, thanks, Chief. I'm good. You look really down. Is something bothering you? No. No, no, no. I'm glad to be back at work. Well, were glad to have you back. Thank you. Any leads on the hit- and-run? Yeah, we might be bringing in a suspect soon, maybe tonight. Good. Get on it. - Welcome back, man. - Thank you. - Stay healthy. - Alright. Take an aspirin. Any news on the Vic? She's in an induced coma at Jackson Memorial. We still don't know if she'll be able to talk. Hey, it's me... again. I hope your okay, because I've called you like ten times today. You're not answering. Um, anyway, I think you forgot to pick me up from work today. But it's okay, I'll find somebody else to take me. Listen, just call me when you get this. I'm really worried. Okay, bye. Babe, are you home? Yeah! I'm downstairs. Uh... I'm down here, I'll be up in a second. I'm so sorry, I forgot to pick you up. My phone died and I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. Just grab some food from the fridge and make dinner. Ok. Thanks! Do you want a tea or something? No. I'm fine. What are you doing here? Just looking for some wine. Found it. Are you ok? You look flustered. Yeah, I just have a headache today. I put the compass in your bag. It might come in handy someday. Ok. Thanks. - Hello? - Hey, It's me. I just wanted to let you know I sent that check again. Good. Is everything okay? I'm kind of busy right now. Is there something you need? Um... Can I speak to Bella? I'd rather not. I just put her to bed. Look... I'm her father. I have the right to talk to her. No. She'll get excited and then I can't get her to sleep. No, no, no. I promise, I won't excite her. I just need to hear her voice. Fine. Give me a second. Hi, Daddy? Princesa. How are you doing, baby? I miss you, papi. When are you coming home? Um... I don't know. I miss you, too. Will you sing me my song. Yeah. Esta nena linda se quiere dormir, cierra los ojitos y los vuelve a abrir. Duérmete mi niña, duérmete mi amor. Duérmete pedazo de mi corazón. Good-night sweetheart. Good-night, Daddy. Are you ready? Almost. You gonna remember to pick me up today or should I ask someone else? I told you, I'm sorry. What else do you want me to do? I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you need to talk. You can tell me things. Thank you. I appreciate that. It's so hard for me to understand your relationship with him. If my parents were still alive, I'd call them every day. I know, It's... It's hard for me. I just feel like I've always been a big disappointment to them. Why? Why would you say that? Because he feels that honesty is the greatest virtue a person can have. And I disagree. You think it's ok to be a liar? No, I just feel that there's other virtues a person can have and honesty is just one of them. It doesn't mean you get to stop calling him. He doesn't like to talk on the phone and every time I see him it's like he wants to get rid of me. I think what we're dealing with is his personality. I don't think it's about you. What's the matter? I feel like that car has been following us since we left home. - The silver one? - Yeah. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna lose him. Pull over to the side. Could you turn the engine off for me? Why'd you pull me over? You ran a red light over there. License and registra, please. I'll be right back. Sir, is this your vehicle? No, it's mine. Why? You mind coming down to the station with me? What for? I just need to ask you some questions? Can't you just ask me here? I was just about to drop my girlfriend off at work. No, it's okay. I'll go with you. Are you sure? Yeah. I'll get someone to cover for me. Follow me. So, you left in the middle of the night to go meet this reporter and then, out of nowhere a random group of thugs jump out of and assault you? Yep. And you didn't report this? Why? Why didn't you report the assault? What a joke. What did you say? This is all a goddamn circus! I was told to keep my mouth shut, What do you want from me? Who told you to keep your mouth shut? What I don't understand is, what was so important that you had to go meet this reporter in the middle of the night? I don't know. Ask her. Don't worry, I will. I just find your story a little too convenient. Well actually, it'd be more convenient to have an alibi. That way I wouldn't have to convince you. You think this is a joke? Huh? This is funny? What is this? What happened to her? I don't know. You tell me. I don't know? I haven't seen her in days. She was last seen having an argument with you. The last person she called was you. You left in the middle of the night, exactly at the time she was hit by a car, a car just like yours. Did you have a relationship with Kelly outside of the office? I don't see how that has anything to do with this. Seventy percent of all the murders I investigate are committed by partners or ex-partners of the victims. I told you everything I know. I don't know what else you want from me. I'll tell you what I want. I want you to make this easy for yourself. You're lucky Kelly is still alive. If you confess... maybe we can make a deal. But if she dies, you're screwed. Thanks for coming on such short notice. This place really annoys me and I've really had enough. She had lunch with him. Call me if you and your boyfriend think of anything else. And don't leave town. I left to meet that reporter, Monica Gordon. You know who she is. The tall one, with short hair. Yes, I know who she is. I just saw her walk into the building. What I want to know is why are you lying to me. I wasn't lying, she was working on a report about something that was going on at work. I just can't talk about it. Listen, if anything happens to me you should find her. She can vouch for me. What's going to happen to you? Why would you say that? I have to go. Let's talk about it later tonight. When I pick you up from work. Everything is gonna be fine. I don't care what happens to me. I'm going to the press. I'm serious. Hey, boss. Okay, I gotta go. - What's up? - Have you heard from Maria? No. Why? Everyone out there is going crazy. They're all asking for her. She didn't come to work today and she isn't answering her phone. I don't know, Manny. Hey, listen, I have a lot going on. Sure. Hey, Cameron, are you ready. Yeah. - Is everything's ok? - Everything's good. - The students are here. - Alright, let's go. What do you think? Another hit-and-run? You again. Still no suspects? I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to report to you. Did you find the car? Why are you here? It's my job. Look, if there's something you know that I don't, please share. Actually, there is. So, if anything happens to me, I need you to tell everyone what you know. What're you talking about, I don't know nothing and I ain't talking to no one. What do you mean you know nothing? You were there. You helped me. Yes, because you asked me to. Manny, you don't understand. You're all I got. Whatever you were doing, that's your thing. It's not mine, ok? Sorry. We've got a warrant for Mr. Shane King. Look, I'm sorry. But I have a family. I gotta take care of them. Shane King. Hands on the desk where I can see them. We got a warrant for your arrest. I can't believe this. I thought you were my friend. Just stop. Take everything, the computer, all the files, and the trash. Let's go. Hey Cam, check this out. The suspect in both cases is this man, Shane Allen King. A long time manager at the company who also happens to be Kelly's ex-boyfriend. Shane confronted Maria who worked at the container company Maria's body was found in the river earlier this morning. Investigators were already looking into Shane and his role before Maria's disappearance. Shane has now been arrested under suspicion of homicide. I know. Go. I'll take care of everything here. You gotta believe me. I had nothing to do with this. What about Maria? She worked for you too, right? Cam, I wish I could explain it to you but I need some time to see how all of this plays out. No, no Shane. You don't have any more time. You're going to prison for murder. If there's anything you can use, you have to use it now. I can't. What do you mean you can't? I can't talk about it right now. Remember that reporter Monica Gordon? Go see her. Maybe she can explain. - I don't understand why you- - Cam, please, trust me. I have two minutes. What do you want? Shane told me I should come talk to you. He thinks you might have some information that can help us. Help you how? I'm not sure. I've never been through anything like this before. I just know Shane is innocent and I'm hoping that you can help me prove it. He told me that you were supposed to meet with him the night Kelly was hit by the car. Did he tell you why we were suppose to meet? No. Look, Cameron? I'm really sorry about what your going through but there's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a piece I have to finish in ten minutes. Good luck. The arraignment for Shane Allen King is scheduled for tomorrow. We'll bring you more coverage of the case as the news breaks. Monica! - Oh! - I'm sorry to sneak up on you. But I don't know what else to do. Listen, I understand. But this doesn't look goodfor Shane. I'm not saying he's guilty but he has no alibi, or witnesses and without that he has nothing. He has me. He was with me the night of the murder. What? The night Maria was killed, Shane was with me. Do you have a lawyer? I spoke with one. He wanted me to make a deal with the State Attorney's Office. So who's defending Shane tomorrow? A public defender. - Oh! - What? Is that bad? Not necessarily. They're just overworked. Please, help me. I'm a reporter. My job is to cover the story. Not to get involved. But you already are involved. Please you know more about this than anyone else. You won't give up, will you? Never. Okay. I'll tell you what I can do. I'll call my lawyer. If anyone can help Shane, it's him. In exchange I want something from you. Anything. As soon as he gets out I want a one-on-one exclusive interview with you and Shane. Do we have a deal? Considering that the defendant does not appear to be a flight risk, and that all the evidence presented by the prosecution is circumstantial, I am inclined to set the defendant free. And I have to say, I think the prosecution is really reaching here. You haven't presented a single piece of direct or physical evidence that proves that there was even a murder here. Or a plausible theory as to what the defendants motivation might be for committing these alleged crimes. I suggest you go back to the drawing board and bring me something with some more merit. Really. The court orders the defendant be released on personal recognizances. Next. Hey, big guy. Tough break. I heard the perp got away. Tyrants in black robes. Sometimes I feel like they make up the law as they go along. You knew that judge. You had to expect he'd rule that way. In the future you gotta make sure that you have your case iron clad. Seems like the only way he was going to keep him locked up was if Shane murdered somebody with his own eyes. And even then he'd still have doubts. Maybe. What're you working on. I may be on to something. I think we've been going about this the wrong way. We've been focusing on the fact that Shane and Kelly were together. We failed to see that the two girls that were attacked worked in the accounting department. Now, when we picked up Shane, we found all these shredded reports in a wastebasket. I think Shane got caught with his hands in the cookie jar. Then he tried to get rid of them. Wow, you have a wild imagination. I think you're grasping at straws. Why don't you take a day off. Come back at it tomorrow. - Oh! - Shane. This has been a nightmare. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. We still have a trial coming up. It's ok. With you by my side, I'll be fine. There's something else. I spoke to that reporter you told me about. Monica Gordon. And? And... she's the one who got you the lawyer. But she wants something in return, she wants to interview us. No. We can't Well, you kind of have to. I promised her. You don't understand. I can't. Okay. Well, then can you explain it to me? I keep trying to help you, but you keep throwing obstacles in my way. If it wasn't for her, you'd still be in there. When? Tonight. What are you doing? I just have some last minute footage I need to use. - What is it? - An interview. Of whom? It's a surprise. Nothing goes on my show without my approval. Huh... your show? I'm your show. Don't you dare import that video. I'm warning you. Fine. Have it your way. - Ready! - Thank you. Here we go. I done. Don't think of it that way. Think of it as an opportunity to prove your innocence. This way. Okay, we're on in ten, everybody. Please... In five, four... Good evening. We interrupt tonight's regular programming to bring you an exclusive interview with a man who has recently been in the spotlight of every local news outlet in South Florida. I'm talking about Shane Allen King. This thirty-seven-year-old Cargo Terminal Operations Manager has been accused of running over one of his co-workers and murdering another. Shane, Cameron, thanks for accepting to do this interview with me tonight. I hear you are both recently engaged. Congratulations. Thank you. I imagine all of this must be very hard on both of you. How are you dealing with it? Cameron's been by my side these last few days. Without her support I'd be totally lost. How about you, Cameron? Have you ever had any doubts that you might be marrying the wrong man? Absolutely not. I've known Shane for years and he's the best man I've ever met. I'm glad to hear that. Shane, let's start with the first victim, Kelly. How did you two know each other? We worked together at the cargo company. I'm a manager there and she's the head accountant. Did you two have a personal relationship as well? Yes. We dated a few years ago. I heard you were actually engaged to get married, is that true? Yes, but like I said, it was a long time ago. Why did you two break up? Personal reasons. According to a person I interviewed, a few days before the wedding you discovered that Kelly was cheating on you. I'd rather not talk about that. You found her in bed with another co-worker. Isn't that right? You found her in bed with Maria. The girl who was murdered. Yes. Kelly and Maria were a couple. Where were you the night Maria was murdered? I was advised not to give specific information about the case. I see. You know, after Kelly was hit by the car, I called Maria for her comments but she didn't call me back. So I did what any thorough reporter would do, I went to her apartment. Now, I have to apologize for the image and sound quality on this video since it was recorded on my phone. Whoa... What is she doing? This was taken just hours before Maria was murdered. How do you know Kelly? She's my wife. We got married in New York this past weekend. I told her not to do this. She's overriding my authority. ...before she was run over by the car. Do you have any idea who might have done this to her? Yes. I think I know. Who do you think did this? It was Shane. Yeah, it was Shane. This interview is over. You set me up! Please, sit down. We can talk about this. Go to hell! I'm sorry for the outburst. We'll be right back. What the hell did you just do? Didn't I tell you not to use that video? Do you have a release for that? What do you care? She's dead. I'm going to have your ass for this. - You'll going to have my ass? - You bet! You should be worshiping the ground I walk on! You call yourself a news producer? You disgust me. I warned you. I told you this was a bad idea. Shane! Why didn't you tell me about Kelly and Maria? Because it was a long time ago. I didn't think it mattered. What about what she said? What about what Maria said? What about it? That doesn't mean anything. She thinks that you did it. I thought you trusted me. I thought you were on my side. I thought I did, too. I see. Shane. Where are you going? Did he leave? Yeah, Monica, he left! What did you expect? I'm sorry, I was just doing my job. You didn't tell me you had that video. Are you sure Shane is who you think he is? I don't know what to think anymore. Can I give you one piece of advise? Just woman to woman. Don't get involved. It won't end well for you. It never does. Oh! Sorry, I didn't know you were here. Did you see the interview on Channel five? Yeah. I couldn't watch it. I had to turn it off. Look what that monster did to my little girl. Have you been able to talk to the doctors? They say it's still too early to tell. We have to wait and see. Now, when we get to the shark spot, I need everyone to get in the water very gently. Keep your backs against the hull and sit upright. I need you to take off all your jewelry right now because sometimes sharks will confuse the glint of your jewelry with fish scales. It's no good for anybody. No touching, no splashing, no horsing around. If a shark happens to nudge you or bite you, don't freak out. Dogs usually bite harder than sharks. They're just trying to get your attention. On the off chance that one does intend to harm, remember, the eyes, nose, and gills are the most sensitive part. Punch, fight, claw like hell and get out of the water fast. Okay? Does anyone have any questions? Aren't you scared? No... Do you know what the deadliest animals are? Mosquitoes. Mosquitoes killed 725,000 people last year. You wanna know how many were killed by sharks? Ten. And that's compared to the millions of sharks that we humans kill each year. So, no. You're more likely to be killed by a mosquito or another human being than by a shark. But... I mean your boyfriend. Aren't you scared he might come after you? I'm sorry. I don't think anyone cares about that. Actually we were all thinking about it. Do you think he did it? Sorry.. I'm not going to talk about my personal life here. Okay, everyone. Let's get our gear on and go for a dive. The tanks are right here. Hey. Who took my stuff? Where's my stuff? I had important papers here. Who went through my desk? Where's my stuff? No, that's okay. I got it. Good afternoon. Have a seat. I'm fine standing, Chief. What's going on? Where were you last night? - I was at the hospital. Why? - No, no. After the hospital. I was having a beer. Drinking. I was off the clock. Look, I'm only doing this to help you out. I think this case might be a little too much for you. You know, with your divorce and everything. You don't have to worry about me, Chief. I'm fine. I want you to hand all your notes over to Detective Brown. Take a couple days off. I'm handing the case over to him. No. That's uncalled for. No, no. I'm about to break this case. Your about to disobey a direct order is what your about to do. No, I am not! This is not right. You're making a huge mistake. Listen Ortega, I was taking down Colombian cartels while you were still sucking your mom's tit. Don't tell me what's right or wrong. Last night you left this office babbling on about some weird accounting bullshit. And today, a reporter does in five minutes what you weren't capable of doing in days. You're a disgrace to yourself and to the department and you're a disgrace to me. So, now why don't you get out of my face before I feed you your teeth for supper! That's an order. Get out! Get out! Now! Hothead. I think he took that well. Hello? Shane? Is that you? I am standing here, outside the parking lot of Jackson Memorial Hospital where, according to doctors, Kelly Jacobson who was allegedly run over by Shane Allen King a few days ago has regained full consciousness. Police are with her right now taking her statement. She is expected to be released later today. Her testimony may be key in putting Shane away for murder. Do you recall anything else? No. That's all I can remember. Are you sure? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. What happened to the other detective that was investigating the case? The case was reassigned to me, ma'am. So, why is the man who did this still on the streets? Why isn't he in jail? That's what we're trying to do, ma'am. We'll be in touch. Thank you very much. Easy does it. Easy. Here we go. The car's right over there. Psst! Kelly! It's okay. Are you alright? What are you doing here? Please. Kelly we need to talk? Leave us alone. - Mom. - It's okay. We're almost there. Anne, listen to me. Leave us alone or I'm calling the cops. Anne, you don't understand. Anne, please! You have no shame! Let's go... Let's go... shoot! Excuse me. Sir, excuse me. Wait! Ugh! Shoot... shoot! Ok, ready? These images where taken just moments after Kelly's car exploded in the parking lot. As you can see in this footage, there appears to be a man running away from the scene. Authorities are now looking at security camera footage trying to figure out who that man was. What are you doing here? What do you mean? I live here. Where have you been? Put the knife down. You're making me nervous. I've been calling you and calling you. I've been worried. I know. I'm sorry. I think you need to leave. I can't. I have nowhere else to go. I feel like I barely know you. Cam, you're the only one who does. Shane, it's over. Take it! No, Cam. I won't accept this. Where are you going? If you're not leaving. I am. - You can't leave. - Of course, I can. Stop. Sit down! Kelly and Maria are dead. If you go outside, you're next. The people who are trying to frame me, are dangerous. I will not let anything happen to you. Hello. You can't hold me here against my will. Don't you see what's going on, Cameron? They've turning everyone against me. Even you. So, what are you gonna do, Shane? What's your plan? Are you just going me in this house forever? I don't know what I'm gonna do. Dispatch, I need a unit. 1975 NE 23rd street! I have to think. There has to be some way out of this. What are you doing? Are you trying to call someone? No! What's wrong with you? - You're so paranoid! - I know, I'm sorry. I'm going crazy. Listen... there was this guy... Pedro. He was a nice guy, he worked at the docks while he was working there, he found out that his five-year-old son was diagnosed with cancer. Now, he needed to work some extra hours to pay for treatments. Union laws wouldn't let him log any extra hours so he came to me to see if he could work on his cousin's name. Now, I know this was illegal but I felt bad for him and I let him do it. And one day, I don't know... he was tired and he accidentally got killed by a fork lift. That's horrible. I don't see how this ties into Maria and Kelly. There was a police investigation. I think you forgot to pick me up from work today. I'm done. I'm going clean. The head detective in charge, detective Garbaccio... Relax. You gonna turn into a baby. I mean, you've been doing this for years. He figured out my involvement. He threatened to hold me personally accountable for Pedro's death. Unless I did him a favor. - Did you tell anyone about this? - No, I kept my mouth shut. I You didn't tell your girlfriend... the diver... what's her name? Why would I tell my girlfriend? What she has to do with this? It's hard to find nice girls like her these days. You don't want anything to happen to her. Are you threatening me? Don't do anything stupid. What did you do, Shane? Alll did, was alter the shipping records. So that whenever a container disappeared, I made it look like they were never there in the first place. That's what Monica was going to reveal on TV, and I agreed to meet with her. But when I did, I don't know, I guess that Garbaccio found out and he sent a group of thugs to jump me and he told me to keep my mouth shut. That's why Kelly and Maria were murdered. What about all those envelopes of cash I found in the basement? That's my money. I put it aside every month for Pedro's family. Why didn't you just tell me all this? I wanted too, but I was ashamed. Then, after what happened to Kelly and Maria I thought that if I told you I might be putting you in danger. You have to tell someone. I can't. I can't. It's too dangerous. We have to disappear. Shane, running is gonna make you look more guilty. I have no choice. Who's that? Who's that? How do they know I'm here? - I called them. - Why? Why would you do that? I'm sorry. Come on. We can escape through the back. Shane, don't. Hey, hey hey! Suspect on foot! Shane... Shane. Stop, stop. Stop! Shane. Put your hands up, turn around, get on your knees. Now. You're lucky I didn't shoot you. You know that? Shane! You look like crap. Thanks. You know that stuff you told me last night. It's all true. There has to be someone I can call who can verify your story. Shh. It's not safe. Remember the engagement gift I gave you. The one I said might come in handy someday. You should take another look at it. - The... - Yes. - Ok. What is it? - Leverage. I gotta go. Hello? - Hi, is this Cameron? - Yes. Who's this? Yeah, look... My name's Manny. I work with Shane at the docks. I really think we should meet. What's this about? No... I can't talk on the phone. Can you be here in thirty minutes? Yes. But how do I know I can trust you? You don't. See you soon. You have to come. He might know the truth. Cameron, it's over. There's nothing else you can do for him. No. You have to believe me. Shane is innocent. Ok... Even if that's so, how do you know this isn't a trap? What if he's just luring you out there to kill you? That's why I need you to come. If you bring your camera and record the meeting, it might protect me. My camera can't protect you. I couldn't protect Maria orKelly and It definitely can't protect you. Now, please, just think about this. It's crazy. I know, but crazy is all I got left. - Hey. - Hey. I heard what happened to Shane. That ain't right. - He didn't do it. - How do you know? I was there when he made the deal. - Is she dead? - I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Honey, relax. I shot Manny, then I fired twice at her and she jumped in the water and she could have drowned. I don't know. If she's still alive, Detective Brown will take care of it. No! He had his shot. He screwed it up. You've already over exposed. You know how many people know came in contact with her. How long you think it going to take them to figure out that you reached out to them just before they died. People believe what I want them to believe. Oh, my god. You are arrogant and naive. You know what you are? You're lucky. You know why you're lucky? Of course, you don't. You're lucky 'cause you have someone to pin it on, now if Shane is in jail or he's dead, what are you gonna do then, genius? What are you saying, Dad? That I shouldn't have done this? I did this for you, to protect you. I never asked you to do any of this! And I never asked you to steal. Oh, no? How else was I gonna spoil you? With your degrees, and your trips, and your cars, and your Europe... and your boyfriends, and your spending money and all this bullshit! Are you seriously saying you did this for me? - Yes. - No. You paid me to protect your image and your marriage, not for me. All I'm saying is let Detective Brown do his job. I would hate it if any of this came back on you. You're just afraid they'll trace it back to you. Hey, Cameron, it's me, Monica. Give me a call as soon as you get this. I've discovered something that can help Shane. Hello? Monica, it's me, Cameron. Cameron, where have you been? I called you like a thousand times. Did you get my messages? I know. I lost my phone. How did it go with Manny? Manny's dead. What? How? He was shot. That's terrible. Are you okay? Where are you? I'm at my boat. What are you doing there? I didn't feel safe going home. Are you alone? Yes. Why don't you come over to my house? - I can help you. - No, no. Okay. Then I'll go to you. I have something you have to see. What is it? It's something that can help Shane. Do you know where my diving school is? Yes. I'll wait for you here. Okay. Perfect. What happened? I don't know. We were just standing there, in the middle of no where and someone started shooting at us. Did you call the police? Yeah, I called but I ran away before they got there. Who else did you tell about this? - No one. Just you. - Alright. Good. - What are you doing? - You like diving don't you? Let's see how long you can hold your breath. Get on. Move. You know you're going to need me to sail back. Nice try. I'll wait for the coast guards. And what are you gonna tell them? You stole my boat? It's not going to be so easy. These people don't work for your Daddy. You know. You were the only person who knew where Shane was going the night Kelly was run over. You arranged for him to have his car smashed. You killed all of them. Even Manny. I should have known the second you walked into Garbaccio's office. Good job. If only you would've figured it out sooner, maybe you could have saved them. But I'm afraid it's too late. Well, it's too late for your father, too. Before you got here, I emailed everything on this flash drive to my sister. I told her If anything happens to me she's to forward it to every TV station in the country. What's on it? It's a recording of your father's meeting with Shane. I don't believe you. Give me the drive. You want it? It's over. Monica! Drop the gun! Monica, drop it. It's the police! According to authorities, reporter Monica Gordon attempted to kill Cameron in order to hide incriminating evidence against her father, Chief Garbaccio, and his band of corrupt officers who where bringing drugs into the country through the Port. Every month someone would come and steal a container and I would tamper with the reports. The testimonies given by Detective Ortega, Shane King, and video recovered from a broken flash drive have been crucial in bringing down a network of corrupt law enforcement officials headed by Garbaccio. I'll wait for you. You're my true north. There's nothing like descending on a shipwreck. It's like uncovering a mystery. Who was on board when she was swallowed up by the sea? What were they doing when it happened? And most importantly, why did they go down? Most people never expect bad things to happen to them until they do. So, always prepare for the worst, but if that day comes, fight like hell, 'cause it's never too late.
