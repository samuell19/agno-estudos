I'm curious about everything Daisung has been successful in many areas But there's always room for improvement Tell me According to a survey I read in a magazine The CBD has a daily traffic of 800,000 potential customers If Daisung established the first Korean shopping centre in Beijing's CBD... Stolen idea... ...the results would be mutually beneficial A Japanese company tried the same thing in CBD You borrowed the idea Do your parents know how clever you are? If it was up to me I hope Daisung considers developing... green apartments Because many people love Beijing but hate the air quality I read magazines too I think the Korean lifestyle and housing design... can marry with the Chinese lifestyle... to advocate for a sustainable smart-living approach I read that from another magazine Today 80% of Beijingers are concerned about the environment For them, going green is good for business... and branding It also raises the bar for personal values How many golf balls can a Boeing 747 hold? A Boeing 747 has a passenger capacity of 350 to 400 The average person weighs 60,000g Each golf ball weighs about 50g The answer should be... 4.8 million I don't think it should be calculated by weight A jet measures about 16 cubic meters Let's say the size of a golf ball is 1,000 cubic millimeters The answer is... 16,000 balls And you? What's your answer? The question... is questionable to begin with How can we possibly know the answer?

She photoshopped her picture before... sending out more resumes I finally got hired My dream to work in the CBD... came true You either get stuck in traffic or get packed into the subway We must choose between the two tortures everyday After the medical exam the Head Secretary assigns desks Our president is Korean They say Korean bosses are more particular about appearance Never wear the same outfit to work for consecutive days If possible... change to a second outfit in the afternoon I'm serious Female employees in particular... you must bring a second outfit to work Refresh your look after lunch We hold our employees to high aesthetic standards Considered yourselves warned [Korean] Understood?

I'm not Just tell me Alright Since you're an honor graduate in Chinese Literature I need your advice Uhuh... go ahead For our new car campaign our MPG is 3 times as efficient as our competitors We want to underline their shortcomings... using a Chinese character comprised of 3 identical parts Any ideas? A word with 3 identical parts... Three 'earths' Yao', translates as tall mountain... or rustic and stupid Three 'hands' That's 'pa' It means stealing from others taking what's not yours And three 'sheep' That's 'shan' When you have 3 sheep together it translates into big stink There's a saying... how does it go... stinking of sheep... and treachery!

I can't remember it all Sure Only four get hired after the probation period I don't want to get cut early Dress pretty and get to stay? How about this one? Oh please, with your square face... you can't wear patterns Let me do it Is my face really square? How can your boss be so demanding? He's Korean; he likes pretty things So did the emperors It's a losing battle The gentleman that just left, what did he buy? Sex education DVDs He didn't just buy one but a whole stack His type is really... What? Horny men are healthy Look at Bill Clinton and John Kennedy Nothing wrong with being horny The problem is that they are not into you Girl, if you want to keep a man you have to ignore the fact that he likes porn Forget it He didn't even invite you... to watch the DVD with him At least I've had a 'sex partner' Show some respect His horniness and promiscuity give you the advantage I never said I liked him, he's sort of ugly But isn't he quite popular in your company?

I'll take it My efforts paid off I got to stay They also moved my desk closer to the power center You only get ahead with good peers Guo Jing Did you sleep with your Korean boss? What's wrong with you? They say Korean bosses are sex maniacs Due to the disparity between her doctored photo and reality They considered Weiwei untrustworthy and rejected her You moved from our house... to the 4th, the 3rd and now the 2nd Ring Road!

Thank God I got a job Actually, I don't want a job I want a long-term meal ticket Don't be so shallow People like me and Weiwei were handicapped at conception If we didn't work hard we would be total failures I didn't go home over the spring holiday I need money to pay for more procedures Are you here for the presale?

Umm... not... exactly You have 3 days to pay a 20 grand deposit and 20 grand each month until the end of the year... in order to secure the down payment Miss one payment and you lose the house and the sum you already paid is non-refundable It's a penalty for breaching the purchase agreement Therefore, think again What are you doing here? You know each other? He's the son who finished university Uh huh Do you plan to buy a house? She said there's no down payment She said we'd make 60 grand a day I also said zero down payment for 3 days You need to pay a deposit by the 3rd day But you said the price would rise And the view... the view is fake What exactly is this?

If Dr. Kim says so, it must be true According to a study plastic surgery can extend your lifespan by 10 years because of its positive impact on self esteem 3 days later, Weiwei came to see me Very scary Does it hurt? How are you? Can you talk? You're one tough cookie How can you take the pain? What is it? That's him? No way... No way! Weiwei said if I had work done just to date someone like him we must truly be ugly I suppose I can't quit then Weiwei said we live in a time when we can own our beauty Our bodies are our business; no one else's Pretty? I inspired Weiwei to get plastic surgery Where are you going? How could you even think about mortgaging the house to have plastic surgery? Move! You two gave me this ugly face.

You can't over-extend a double eyelid The proportions now are very natural Doctor, I want my nose to look... like this That's too high, completely out of proportion Screw proportion, just make me beautiful! Doctor, look I want lips like Angelina Jolie This... this is really too much A kindred spirit! This woman is a veteran of plastic surgery She's had work done from head to toe After I had a butt augmentation I didn't dare to sit for a long time Afterwards I went to the US to get a gastric balloon It's good for losing weight since you can't eat as much After surgery, I threw up day and night But after the rains comes sunshine I can reaps the fruits of my labor now Can you guess my age? You look 27, 28 I'm guessing you're close to 37, 38? I'm 60! 60?! I love seeing this reaction from people! Before she left, she even asked me to join her Botox club I'm so sorry We can't go to the concert tonight It's been cancelled That's alright Let's go for dinner Dinner? Just a simple meal, anything will do But I have a meeting tomorrow morning... You can't stand me up I went through a lot of trouble! Calm down What kind of trouble? Just... trouble Alright. What do you want to eat? Anything I deliberately chose a dimly lit restaurant My face is still swelling a little I was afraid of disaster Are you alright? I'm fine Waited long? No Have I been exposed? My eyes are so small, this place is so dark I can barely see you Good Good? It's good that you have small eyes You won't see people's flaws so easily The world will look better to you Since your eyes are so big, do you see all my flaws? Yes Tell me what my flaws are Women don't tell me Your main flaw is too many girlfriends They're female friends Do you see a difference? Of course Female friends... We don't need to waste time to understand each other A girlfriend is different She could be my wife It requires long observation I only want to find one Once I find her, I won't look at other women Then go find her Where do I start? Any ideas? Anywhere When you look into the eyes of someone you like you'd discover a different side of yourself Let me see I see him When was the last time you had a girlfriend? 2 years ago Where did you meet her? I forget But I remember how we broke up She had work done and completely changed her face When she denied it, I broke up with her I hate people who undergo plastic surgery as if changing their faces can change their lives So I hid in the shadows for the rest of the evening Does plastic surgery boost your self-esteem or ruin it? I was getting confused I stayed up all night I decided to tell him the truth the next day The following day I lost my resolve Guo Jing What skincare have you been using lately? It's European It's really good European? Hey, Guo Jing Do you have a moment? What is it? Your face looks different Really? I switched to a new skincare product Once you say the word skincare, women believe it This is what Guo Jin uses It's amazing! She does look more beautiful! The Head Secretary loves talking about her family history... from her mother to her ancestors from the Ming Dynasty Today everyone found an excuse to avoid her... except for me... I got caught You want to hear more? I should... go If you listen to my great great great grandma's story you'll go on a business trip with Raymond! It's common knowledge that business trips are assigned based on beauty The prettiest are sent to the US B-grade beauties go to Japan The bottom ones go to the coal mines Excuse me, wait... After listening to the Head Secretary's stories My wish was granted But I forgot one important detail: the photo on my ID! Are you alright? I'm fine It's time to renew your ID photo Thank you I told you to go through Chenqi to get to Ergun City How could you confuse Chenqi with Xiqi? As a driver, you should have learned Mandarin! Don't fight with the driver You never know who you're yelling at Are you circling on purpose or are you just lost? Install a GPS device! Do you even know where we are? Father's prairie, mother's river Why don't you learn our language instead? Listen to yourself See your family photo? We hired you because you had a family to feed Now you're complaining? Let us out! We could go as far as Russia by now! We can't get out here, it's a wasteland I'm not taking this crap! Stop the car! Guo Jing, I'll never go on a business trip with you again Don't worry. Follow me Boss, grab the luggage My face is so dirty Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? I've dislodged my chin! Dr. Kim went to Switzerland I called him long distance Hello... Dr. Kim? Dr. Kim... my chin... Dr. Kim? How are you? Skip 'how are you'! Help me, help me please How do you do? I am not fine! How do you do? I forced them to use a dictionary It took an hour to explain I fell and dislodged my chin I suggested using a shoehorn to force my chin back into place They warned me, in English: You must not I couldn't care less! Why can't I go with you? Why are you being so clingy? You're not making sense I'm really shy I can't let you see me without makeup, bye! He couldn't see why I wouldn't let him take me to the hospital Of course he couldn't! Where's Dr. Kim? He's still in Switzerland. The Chief Physician will operate on you The Chief? Our Chief is a Fauvist I'm finished How do you feel, Guo Jing? This is our Chief Physician You should have been more careful You rode a camel before your chin fully healed Let's change the subject I have good news for you Our hospital is launching a new product called NoBra Are you interested? Guo Jing, want to give it a try? But I vowed never to undergo plastic surgery again Are you sure? Pity... NoBra is no ordinary implant Do you know the cost? 128 grand How can I pass it up? Screw the vow! I told the Chief I agreed to be the spokesmodel for NoBra on one condition: they must obscure my face on all publicity materials All sorts of things can go wrong with breast augmentation Also, implants will age They might eventually leak, rupture or explode and... Stop it! Say no more. I want them Good. Let's proceed Using my previous fall as an excuse, I took a 2-week leave... enough time for me to heal I finally have breasts! I don't understand how he got promoted over me My team recorded the most sales last year Why was I passed over? If the best performer doesn't get promoted I should reconsider whether or not to stay When you joined the company, you promised in 5 years... you wouldn't get married or pregnant Remember? I do A child called here, looking for his mother He is your child and you're married, correct? You lied to the company I didn't lie I didn't get married or pregnant after joining the company You concealed the truth right from the start But it didn't affect my work True. That's why I didn't fire you As for promotion? No! If I told you I was married and had a child would I have been hired? No You may think it's unfair but the company also has a human side Now that we know you have a family we will reduce your workload It's not discrimination but empathy You must want to spend more time with your family Sooner or later you'll lose that hunger and rest on your laurels That kind of mentality doesn't mesh with senior management In the end, Monica quit her job In death, there is no escape In life, don't hold your head high Guo Jing Are you alright? I'm fine Cool The project... Why are you still standing there? My foot hurts Take some rest I'll try What is it? Nothing, today's my birthday I was going to invite you over to try my home cooking But your foot It's fine. I can manage You don't need to rest?

Patience, people I'll bring Guo Jing out to see you in a minute Hurry! I want to see her pretty face! I want to see how an ugly duckling turned into a swan! Exactly When I grow up, I want to be just like Sister Jing-jing She's on the internet! TV crews will be here next When they come, I'll tell them... how smart she was as a child She's quite accomplished... She's the pride of our village We are all so proud! We should all cheer for her! Why don't you go outside? How dare you? What were you thinking? Have you no shame? If you don't feel ashamed I do What are you crying for? Friends and relatives have known your face for 20 years Now, look at you Are we still family? I can't even tell if you're my daughter If I'm not your daughter, who is? It's against nature! When Japan invaded China... they cut people open for experiments! That's what happened to you! What if they left a scalpel in your chest? What did you do that for? You felt it, is there a scalpel? What about the needles? What if you contracted HIV? I'm fine. It's all over now The doctor gave you anaesthesia What if he also removed your uterus? Mom, where did you get this nonsense? How can you laugh? You want me to have a stroke? Dad A good face brings fortune My little sister's sacrifice will be rewarded Our generation is not the same as yours Don't you know we want to control our own fate See that house? It's been what... 16 years? It was abandoned, now it's demolished That's change, progress, right? People are like appliances, who wants refurbished ones? A week passed, I was now a celebrity at the village Mom also began to accept my new face Soon, I had a job interview Who says appearances don't matter? Weiwei had her eye bags 'removed' Afterwards her eyes wouldn't close She didn't sleep for 3 days Are you alright? How can I be? I haven't slept for 3 days How long can humans survive without sleep? I don't know Am I going to die? Of course not You'll just be more beautiful Really? Don't laugh! Even if I was assigned the toughest job I'm confident my body and mind could handle it You're about to go on vacation you already purchased your ticket The company suddenly needs you at work What would you do? Refund the ticket and report for work since I'm a workaholic I won't enjoy a vacation I remembered when Raymond interviewed me I suppose... I would ask if there were other options Was another colleague available? Or could it wait until I returned from vacation? If both answers were no I'd refund the ticket and report for duty Do you think Raymond liked me because of my honesty? He liked me when I was frank Do you know what upset me the most? You planned out the whole thing First you got work done, then you seduced me Then you lured me into bed What did you take me for? Prey? What about you? You did just the same to other women! How is it the same? How is it not? Because I'm a man If you were a man, you would understand... how much you hurt me! Listen, Guo Jing If you understood men better you wouldn't want plastic surgery No man wants his woman to get plastic surgery Without plastic surgery, would you have fallen for me? Tell the truth No Each person needs to own their limitations That takes courage Guo Jing, I thought you had it Men prefer natural beauty Aren't you naturally beautiful after plastic surgery? Weiwei's parents finally sold the southern wing of their house After that Weiwei got a Botox brow-lift They botched it; her brows are now uneven Then she went for a Jaw Reduction But the equipment broke down mid-operation The surgeon had to shave her jawbone manually The surgery lasted hours She asked for takeout food but she could only sniff it because she couldn't eat She made a necklace out of the bone to commemorate... the new chapter in her life Cheese! She was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder In lay terms it means her self-image is completely skewed She thinks she's ugly regardless how pretty others think she is, she feels inadequate One day, she fainted on the street Before that, she requested... a belly button reduction Her doctor denied her request and she was traumatized One day I found an article... criticizing our society's obsession with instant success The writer is a man He'll never understand what it means to have a pair of 220cc NoBras instead of 180cc Who is to blame for our fixation on physical appearance? Men only choose inner beauty over the outer one... when they're at an ATM When will people stop pretending and express their true selves? I thought of Monica, is she still pretending to be unmarried? Weiwei finally stopped asking her doctor for more procedures He gave her a rubber band to wear on her wrist She snaps it whenever she craves more surgery She snapped it so often her wrist got infected Her doctor wouldn't operate on her again so she went to an underground clinic for full-body lipo-suction Did she have any fat left? It's going to take 6 months for her to recover The surrogacy agency gave me a call They now also provide "Rent-a-friend" services Someone saw my photo and wanted me to play his girlfriend How... how can you be so much prettier in real life? You want a girlfriend for show to make your parents happy The prettier the better, right? They won't believe it if you're too pretty They'll worry I'm being conned Can you find me someone less attractive? No My ugliest friend is also beautiful now What can I do? I already paid the agency No problem. Think it over. I'll do it for free I was in the same boat, once upon a time Let's take a wedding photo? A wedding photo? I want to develop a full story Later, I'll tell them we got married in Beijing They'll be happy and stop worrying about me You're a good son Can we? We'll just take photos, no ceremony They'll be so happy when they see you If they die... they'll die happy Miss, you look so beautiful in this dress! Thanks That word, what does it mean? Yao', three 'earths', means tall mountains Isn't it a bit archaic? No. "Separated by tall mountains", it's simple If not, check the dictionary, it's more memorable You're right Miss, perhaps you'd like to see our flower arrangements? Here is some of our work There won't be a wedding Ah... a civil ceremony I'M NEAR YOU. I'M COMING OVER. WE NEED TO TALK Hey, Miss, wait! I don't understand why I'm running either Perhaps I'm afraid what he'll say? If he rejects me, I'll be devastated If he accepts me, I can't revert back to my old look! Watch out! A car crash? Don't worry. We'll save your face! Wonderful! We finally became equals We got married and had a baby But how will we explain to him why he look so different? 1, 2, 3 Maybe we should call Dr. Kim?
