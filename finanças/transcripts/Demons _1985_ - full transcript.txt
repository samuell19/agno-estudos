Ah! Ah...Can I have another one? It's for a friend of mine. She's waiting for me. Thank you. Er...Are you dressed like this for the promotion of the film? Kathy! Kathy! Sorry I'm late. You usually are. Mrs buckles is just gonna blow her stack again. She'd scream at us even if we were early. Look what I was given. - Doesn't the movie have a title? - No. Maybe it's a sneak preview. You know, they show a brand-new movie in a theatre just to see the reaction of the public. Where is the metropol? I've never heard of it. Me, neither. Maybe it's new. What do you say we go and forget about mrs buckles? Sometimes you really worry me, Cheryl. You're leading us astray! It was just an idea. Hey, look, Kathy. There it is. Hey, you don't think it's gonna be a horror movie, do you? - You know I just hate them. - And I hate missing the start. Come on. - Are you sure you want to cut class? - Hm. I'll hold your hand if it's scary. That's strange. I didn't know there was a movie house on this street. Closed down a couple of years ago. Looks like they spent some money on it. - How come I never noticed it? - You never notice anything, darling. Please, frank, don't start. This is our anniversary. So what? I'm taking you to a show. - What else do you want? - Straight ahead, sir. Straight ahead, please. - Great bike, huh? - It's fantastic! Absolutely fantastic. Oh, rats! Come on, give us back the money! - God, I hate these machines. - Hey, Ken, forget the bike. - What are you doing? - Hitting the coin return. Oh, forget it. It's ripped us off. - These things only happen to you. - It's not my fault if the machine... Looks like you're having problems. Thanks. Sometimes all it takes is the right touch. I thought you said you just hate to miss the start of a movie. Liz? - Liz! - Yes, Werner? - Don't touch it. - Touch what? This. No, I never go. There are too many people on the beach. Hey! How do I look? - Terrific. - Do you like it, Bobby? - Sexy, huh? - I think you look silly. - Just a sec... - Hey, cut it, baby! Ow! What was that? - You cut yourself. - Oh, shit! That'll teach you to touch things. What is he getting so mad for? It was just... Why don't we sit next to this guy? He's cute. Sit here and shut up! Jesus, this is what you call enjoying yourself? I bet they're gonna come and sit here. Come on. - Hi. - Hi. Charlie, love, did you bring the popcorn? Shut up, you stupid bitch!

Look! There's something written on this. - It's an inscription or something. - What's it say? "They will make cemeteries their cathedrals, "and tombs your cities." Eughg! According to an old legend, nostradamus was buried here. Nostradamus? Sounds like a rock group to me. Yeah, top of the pops in 1500. - They had rock groups then? - Edith! - So tell me, computer brain. - He was kind of a fortune teller. A prophet from the 16th century. He predicted a whole mess of things that have come true. Such as? Such as, for example, the discovery of Neptune and uranus, Hitler, world wars, the coming of the demons. Big deal, that hasn't happened. Not yet. There's still time. A horror movie. I knew it! I told you this was a great place. Come on... If you get scared, you can always hold my hand. I won't mind. But I thought you said he was gay... Shut up! - It was this way, right? - Yeah. Watch your step. - What's that? - More tombs. Aargh! It was only a bat! What's happening, Liz? Yeah, so why didn't he die of a heart attack? They're going down into a crypt, Werner. It's dark. Hey, here's the way down. Come on, Nancy, you're next. And now it's one of the girls. Aren't they scared? Yes, they are. No! I can't do it. Pull me back up, somebody! Just let yourself go. - Come on. - I can't. - Smoking is not allowed in here. - Excuse us. We're nearly there, for god's sake, just close your eyes, Jerry'll catch you. Hey, Tony... Hookers...Fucking everywhere. What do you care? Let's try down there. This way, girls. These cobwebs! Yuck! I'm scared. " Liz? ' Yes? - Are you scared? - Yes, I am. Watch where you put your feet, girls. See those cracks in the floor? Under one of those you might find yourself side by side with nostradamus' skull or ribcage. Cut it out. I came for a ride on your new bike, not for this. It's not fair. Besides, I told my parents I'd be home early tonight. What do you say, Jerry? Shall we tell them the truth? - What are you talking about? - Tell them. We're the first people to set foot in this crypt in centuries. That hole we came through only fell in this morning. - How do you know? - Me and Bob heard the crash. We decided to come back tonight so you could enjoy the discovery. - Thanks a lot! - Look, nothing's gonna hurt you. Vampires and all that stuff only exist in movies. Hey, more tombs. Must've been a real big-shot with a fancy one. - Let's get out of here, please. - Just a second. Hey, look, it's got some kind of seal on it. Bob, give me some light down here. Wait a second. It's gotta be a name. N...O...S... It's nostradamus! Come on, open it. Come on, let's get out of here. This place is giving me the creeps. Hey, use this iron bar. Agh! What are you screaming for? You knocked it over! - Oh, I'm sorry. - It's ok. My name's George. Mine's Cheryl. Cheryl, if I have a heart attack, it's your fault. Hi. Great movie, huh? - Hey, no bones. - Just an old book. And something wrapped in cloth. Let me see it. Well, what's it say? It's in Latin. I can't figure it out... Yes, I can, wait a second. It's written by nostradamus. It's something about demons. Look, bring it with you, but can we go now? No, just a second. It says here that demons are instruments of evil. Trick or treat? - Don't do that! - How do I look? - Whoever wears it becomes a demon. - How do you know? It says here whoever wears it becomes a demon and an instrument of evil. Yeah, sure. Now we know why you looked so good in it! Thanks a lot, Tony. He will spread pestilence and contaminate the world. Remember that inscription outside? "They will make cemeteries their cathedrals, "and tombs your cities." Hey, your cheek's bleeding. You must've scratched yourself when you took the mask off. - It's nothing. - Oh, shit! - What's the matter? - It started bleeding again. I'll be right back, huh? That's funny, the bleeding won't stop. It doesn't matter. Just leave me alone, huh? - Tony? - Yeah? You see that? The same thing happened in the movie. Ah, it's a bunch of shit, baby. If we only had something to disinfect it with. Nancy, stop mothering me. It's just a scratch. But you can't leave it like that. Come on, let's go. - I'm all right, I tell you. - You're white as a sheet. - Jerry, are you sure you're ok? - Just leave me alone! Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm leaving... Ugh! Ah... Ugh! Oh! Oh! Agh! No! Aargh! Aargh! No-o-o! No, don't do it! No! Ls it over yet? Yes, you can look now. Don't tease me, torn. Ls it really over? Yes, silly. Aargh! What the hell happened to Rosemary? Maybe I should go check and see if she's ok. Don't you disappear too! Aargh! Aargh! Aargh! - It's too bloody of a movie. - Ruth, shut up! Aargh! Somebody! Rosemary? Rosemary? Rosemary? Are you ok? Aargh! Aargh! Somebody help me! Aargh! Somebody help me! Help! Somebody help me, please! Somebody! We must go see what happened. - Liz? Liz, where are you? - What were those shouts? Seems to come from the Abbey. You must be wrong. Nobody goes near those ruins. - Well, I saw some kids on bikes. - When? About half an hour ago. The bikes are still there. They were there this morning, too. Liz! Liz! Liz, where are you? He's calling me. I better get back to him. Let's call the police. Answer me! Liz! Liz! I gotta go. He knows we're here. Patrick! Patrick! Agh! Somebody! Aargh! Aargh... Somebody help me! Aargh! Somebody help me! There's somebody behind the screen. - Those screams sound real. - Come on, it's the dolby system.

Ah... aargh! There's some kind of madman loose in here. What the hell's going on here? - Cheryl! - I'm sorry, it's my fault. I should have never suggested we come here. The movie... It's happening just like in the movie! Son of a bitch! Shit! Hey, George, look at her fingernails. My god, what's happening? It can't be true. Shit! We gotta get out of here. Get out!
