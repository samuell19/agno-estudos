Help join the fight to save our world. awaits you. Dawnseeker. It's one of the meanest, nastiest sumbitches we ever laid eyes on. Now Omnia Prime is home to many, many surprises. Most of which are designed to do one thing, and one thing very, very well, and that's kill humans. Or anything that doesn't eat, breathe, or even shit the way they are used to. Now am I making myself crystal clear as to what we are up against? Good, now the Dawnseeker has one objective. One objective only. That is to find, extract the precious asset known as stardust, which is the only thing that's keeping that piece of shit floating rock we call Earth from reverting back to the dark ages. So I'm not gonna have to tell you how important it is that we locate the Stardust and hightail our candy asses back to base straight to Nemean, understood? Now as long as we have this, we have him. You rise at oh five hundred. Get some rest, boys. It has like five eyes or some shit. What do you think, Evo? Yeah. Miles to go. I'm gonna get you. Yeah, you know he gets it. The hierarchy. It's best you don't forget that. 'Cause if you do? Ooh, remember this face. That's enough. Excuse me? That's enough, Otto. I'll be seeing you around. Attention, the reactor sector is being isolated. Repeat, the reactor sector is being isolated. Attention, the reactor sector is being isolated. Repeat, the reactor sector is being isolated. I can't do this, Father. Fenix, you're more important than you know. Look at your target and focus. You really think I can do this? Fenix, one day you will be called upon to change the world, and everything I have built for mankind will belong to you. How many with you? Just me. Darby... Darby didn't make it. Shit! Where are the others? What happened to our ship? The others? I've been pinned down here for over a week. Rendezvous at these coordinates. Who are you? Name's York. York? Third battalion, ninth level infantry. My planet has been mining here in peace for generations. I don't follow. You are from Planet Beta Four, right? Beta Four? You mean Earth. No, Planet Beta Four. I wouldn't know what you call your planet, now would I? Tell me who sent you! Who sent me? What did they tell you? That you were on some great mission? Some save the world kind of shit? Nemean has been stripping the resources from this planet for decades. It's time he learned to share. What are you talking about? We need him! We need him! Give me something! If we are to make it to the rendezvous, we need him. He's been trying to kill me for over a week and all you have is we need him. What she's saying is, if I'd have wanted you dead, you already would be. You have a rescue party. I ain't gon' be here. The fuck are you talking about? We were never meant to leave this place. I'm impressed. Stiffen up and let's play? Yours cowboy. Show you guys something. Happened when your vessel broke through the sky. What happened to him? I was hoping you could tell me. How the fuck would we know? He was wearing this fancy wristband, figured it meant something. Galen? Not far from your crash site. See, I figured his mono-pod must've malfunctioned in the crash. No, pods couldn't have caused this. This was done to him. How can you be so sure. Because, it is a perfect kill. Whoever did this wanted us to find him this way. You get all that from a dead body? No, and the fact that his wristband is still intact, they were clearly only after one thing. Which is what? Recognition. It says I am here. What about the mission. Hey, how will we get paid? A man is dead, our entire purpose here is at stake, and you're worried about your credits? Hey, he's dead, ain't he. It's more credits for me. And York, York. Say, tell me, they got credits on whatever the fuck planet you're from? Huh? Why don't you and I go get the stardust ship and double the price? Make that money. Huh? You hear me, are you deaf? I heard you? Then what's the problem. Let's get paid. There's only one problem. With your skills and mine, we can make it all the way to the solar fields, you know that. Come on. It's not what I found at the crash that concerns me. It's what I didn't find. The Dawnseeker. Dead! How can you be sure? Because no one could've survived that. Nothing! Whatever's shielding us from what lies beneath the safe area, it's the solar fields. What are those? Designed, created, whatever they are, they protect us from what's out there. Is that why they built a city here? Different regimes like to converge, trade. And what of your regime? Who do you fight for? I guess we're about to find out. Jax, you're giving away our position. To who, Evo? Face it, Jax, we're on our own. Did you hear that? Yeah. Did you hear that? Don't move! It's us! How many with you? Anyone? Just us, why? Did you see anyone, anything? It's not possible. Jax. Just us. Jax! You ain't sending us your location. But why? Evo, Evo, Evo! Hope that's looking for something bigger. Shit! Grenade! Evo! Evo! Evo! Evo! What did this? Nothing I wanna meet anytime soon. We need to get to the Space Ark. That's a lot of credits. The Space Ark doesn't sound like it equals credits in my account, so I say fuck it and fuck you. Let's go get some stardust. He has a transponder. Without it, no one's calling a ride home. Hey, where you going? I said where are you going? Whoever took Evo laid a trap for us. You aren't even gonna look for him? Why? I can't grant him passage to the afterlife. She's a princess. You're wasting your time. Yeah, I know who you are. Nemean Chord's very own. What? You think we wouldn't recognize the boss's daughter? Tell me, since we're all so expendable, how long before you leave us all behind, huh? You wanna find your boyfriend, go find him yourself. Otherwise, go to hell. You go first. Now here's what's gonna happen. We're gonna search that trail over there. We're gonna get that transponder. And then we're gonna go find some stardust because I didn't travel 50 years for nothing. You, go grab the stardust container. After you, princess. Stay back! Evo! Where is your transponder? Stay back! Help me. One of your faction members? No, I've never seen energy like that. Felt like it was toying with us. Thought you said this planet was void of intelligent life forms? Void? What did they tell you this place was back on Beta Four. Best to mine stardust, nothing more. Mine? Stardust can only be found in one place and one place only, and that's where your dawnseeker breed. See they're born in tubes. They harvest the energy from the stardust to hatch their larva. If they're as powerful as I've read about, we got much larger problems. Hey! Look what I found. We have to figure out what we're up against. You said twos. Pairs. Manipulating matter, cloaking, energy, basically the ultimate goddamn killing machine. Helmet was a dampener. What are you thinking? That it may still be figuring out what it's capable of. And that's why it didn't try to kill us? Nah. It's why it didn't try to kill her. Where's the other one? Jax? Jax? Jax! Jax? Jax! Where'd she go? Oh, I got you. Get off me! No need to thank me. And who the hell are you? Do you have a ship? What? A ship? Ugh. Why'd you stop me? I almost had it? Going after a dawnseeker is suicide. Not this one. It hasn't fully developed yet. How would you know? Because we brought it from Earth. Earth? Terminus hasn't destroyed it yet? Terminus ended centuries ago. How long have you been here? Okay, I say we follow it through the north quadrant, wait for it to get thirsty, and then we'll find a way to. Jax! Jax! She was just here! Lieutenant Thane of the Black Suns. Fenix, from Beta Four. We're searching for a fugitive, highly skilled and dangerous. Can't say it rings any bells. What are you other men? We're just out on a stroll, taking in the sights. And you? I'm, uh, I'm their guide. Hey! We haven't seen her. I will have answers. No honest mercenary'd be caught dead in these parts. Unless you're trying to hide something or looking for something that needs to be hidden. Arrest them! Stripping and mining this planet's resources is against galactic law! Call in the coordinates. Get a transport out here immediately. You are making a big mistake. Dawnseeker has breached your wall. He has adapted to the magnetic pulse. We had similar gear in our tech. The only thing that breached our walls is staring right back at me, and if you don't stop flapping them two things on your face, I'm not gonna be so nice. Good! I wouldn't have done that. I want a pawn to rook formation from corner to corner. Nothing moves out here without me knowing about it. Is that clear? Sir, yes sir! Sir, yes sir! Defensive positions. To the right! Cut us loose! Cut us loose! Defensive positions! To the right! I said cut us loose! Watch out! Go! Fall back! Fall back! E.M.P.! Oh, that seemed... different. That's because it was. It learned fast. No, this one was more skilled, more adept. So got another one of those on Beta Four? I think we may have found his counterpart. What? You shitting me? There's another one out there? God! It's pinned us in. Because it didn't try to harm any of us? Pulse wave knocked out the solar fields. What's that mean? Whatever was on the other side of the Space Ark just got an open invitation. We need to get to the other side of the Ark. The other side. We need to set up a perimeter. We need to cross over. I thought you said it wasn't safe on the other side of the Ark. That's before it was less safe on this side. If I've learned nothing, I've learned nothing's safe when the solar fields are down. Let's get the pikes. The way I see it is, Otto is looking out for himself. And Thane only cares about his men, so, so it's just you and me, what do you say? Let's just try and make it through the night. You know, I had a family once. Daughter. You remind me of her. Smart. Stubborn. Till we were low on credits. I did something I... Promised my wife I'd never do again. There's a few truths in this world. And never change, no matter how much you want to. You can never trust anyone but yourself. You just gotta ask yourself one question. What do you think they'll do to us by dawn? Know if my men are compromised in any way, I will kill you myself. I caught this one tampering with the pikes. Zan Desai, last of the eternals. We've searched the galaxy far and wide for you. The stories are true. I made my name taming dogs! You're wanted for the destruction of planet Demo, the killing of the alpha group known as the eternal Beta Four, and numerous other charges of treason and evasion. Why'd you tamper with the pikes? How did you escape? I didn't mess with the pike. I activated it. You can't run from the Black Suns. We always get our mark. I wasn't running. They have what I need. Thane, I think we have movement. Check it out, now! Is it back? Move in! Go, go! Sucker punching piece of shit! Like I said, let's get to the other side of the Ark. Hey. Why you always getting your ass kicked? You're such a bad ass. Seriously, everybody that meets you wants to beat the shit out of you. Let's go! In order for us to cross over, we need to know what frequency the Ark is vibrating at. Frequency, what's that matter? Well, we're operating at a different frequency, it could trigger our matter as hostile. Turn the would be portal into a microwave. Precisely. And I believe there are other mercenaries trapped just on the other side. You think they left their ship. That's the idea. But what about the Earth's sun? Stardust? Do they know? Know that you're a criminal, a treacherous backstabbing snake? I think that was made clear, yeah. Funny how people never seem to ask the right questions. I suggested gagging you but decided against it. How's Father doing nowadays? Father couldn't care less about saving the planet and even less if you were alive. So you had to come see for yourself. You're welcome. Some rescue. Don't look like you needed rescuing. Do they know you sabotaged the ship to crash land here? No more than they know what you're truly doing on this side of the Ark. How long are you going to keep up this little charade? As long as it takes. I have no intentions of saving Beta Four. Although I wish your planet well, my job is to keep you at bay while my employer obtains the stardust for his self. Hold me at bay? You son of a bitch! You could've fucking killed me! York's a galactic legend. Singlehandedly took down the prison, ice prison in Pompeii. That's not a man who's easily bested. Now tell me, what of this other dawnseeker. It isn't a weapon. It's a living species, and from what I gather, not from this planet. What do you mean? This Space Ark is a ripple in time caught between realms. On their planet, the dawnseeker's no different from you and I. A species with multiple layers. That's why I'm on this side. In order to save Earth, you must save the sun on the other side of the Ark. The Earth will exist in a different ideal of time. So you're gonna keep those things as trophies or what? Each member of the Black Suns is born and bred on the battlefield. Where I come from, war has no peace after it. Go. Go! Now! The Space Ark's right ahead. I knew you would be here. York? Are you alright? We need a plan. What are you talking about? The Space Ark's right up there? Yeah, but there's one problem. See, I have my transponder. Fenix has Evo's, and I'm fairly certain, yeah, there's no doubt, you've got one. And I don't have to tell you that without a transponder you can't cross over the magnetic field to the Space Ark. So... Hey no, what are you doing? The way I see it, someone's gotta be bait. If you destroy the transponders, none of us can cross through the Ark. You think I wanna survive this? No. See, I know why the dawnseeker won't harm you. 'Cause you set it free! Why don't you be a doll and hand it over. What are you doing? No! Stop! You're next, sweetheart. Now you. I said you! Go! We have to hurry up and get the stardust before sun burns up while we're not there. The order predicted that the space time ratio between what's left of Earth and the dying sun shouldn't be a concern until 2240. Exactly. What year is it? It's July 2245. We have a very short window to find the stardust and deliver it before we have to seal ourselves into hibernation pods again for the winter. Look. What's that? Is that? The Ark? This used to be a portal to the other side? Transfusion fiber. This isn't just a gateway. This is a time machine. Careful. Dawnseeker! Hey! We have to cross through the Ark! Go! The Ark may close! You need to get the stardust! The ship. Fenix! We need power to the main console. Stardust. I've never seen this type before. It's pure, not from this planet. How do you know that? 'Cause I brought it. We need to get off this ship and fly it directly into the sun. Last chance? Subtitles by explosiveskull
