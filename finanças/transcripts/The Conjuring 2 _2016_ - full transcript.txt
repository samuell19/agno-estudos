After everything we've seen, there isn't much that rattles either of us anymore. But this one... This one still haunts me. Two months prior to our involvement, the Lutz family had fled their home in the middle of the night, claiming that the house was haunted. The Church had reached out to us for help. They wanted to see if we could confirm the activity that had been reported by the Lutzes. Mm-hmm. Okay. We ready? Then let's get started. I'd like you to sit quietly and close your eyes. Envision yourself in a halo of glowing white light. It will protect you. The year before the Lutzes moved in, a young man named Ronny DeFeo had brutally murdered his entire family in this house. We'd hoped to discover if the killings had been motivated purely by anger or if, as Ronny DeFeo testified in court, he had been under the influence of something demonic. Stay here. Stay. Kill her. Kill her. Shoot them. Shoot them! Shoot her! What did you do? What did you do? Shoot her. Kill her. Shoot her! Shoot them all. Shoot! Kill! Kill her. Shoot her. Kill her. Shoot her. Honey, you okay? What are you seeing? Lorraine. Lorraine, what is happening? I have to see. We're through. We're through. It's time to come back. What is happening? It wants to show me. Lorraine! Lorraine! Oh, God! Oh! Honey. Honey. It's okay. It's okay. Ed. This is as close to hell as I ever wanna get. - Damn kids! - Really. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Keith and I are going to sneak out tonight with his friend, Michael, who wants to meet you, by the way. No way. If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead. So don't get caught, you priss. Here, hold this. Gotta give you back the spirit board that we made. I think I'll let Keith French kiss me. What? No way! What you two doing? Janet, give that to me. And get inside, both of you. Go. M-M-M-M-Margaret. Margaret! Johnny! Janet! Billy! Hello. How was your day? Not good. Why? What happened? It's a long story. I'll tell you later. All right, then. W-w-what's up? B-B-B-B-Billy? Shut up, Peter. Lesbo! What, are you talking about your mum? Oh. Thank you, Camilla. No problem! He's just a wanker. Ignore him. Okay. Mum's gonna kill me. What did you do now? It wasn't me, it was Camilla. What did you do with Camilla? It's a long story. Boys! Watch the road! - Janet! - Up you go, Billy. Ow! Come on. I'm saying I won't be able to pay my rent this month. No. I talked to them, and they put me through to you. Please keep calm... I am being calm. Well, I don't understand why you can't help me. No. No. He hasn't paid a penny of child maintenance for three months. - We're home! - I see. That's bloody brilliant. - Hi, Mum! - You have a good afternoon as well. Janet. Are things not bad enough around here, that I've got to get a call from your headmistress who says that you was caught smoking? I wasn't! I wasn't smoking. I promise. - Did you get the biscuits? - Did you just not hear me? I talked to Mrs. More on the telephone. How can you stand there and lie to me like that? I'm not lying! Yes, she is! It's all over the school. She was smoking with Camilla. Shut up! You are such a liar, Johnny! Mum! You said we would get me some... No, Billy. I didn't get any bloody biscuits because we don't have any bloody money! ... and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon ... Mum's coming. You better quit messing with that and brush your teeth! All right. Sounds like the whole city's burning down in here. Look what I found! Biscuits! But you said we don't have any money. Well, I've been meaning to quit smoking anyway. - Margaret? - Yes? Have you got your school uniform for tomorrow? Yes, Mum. I'm getting it. Johnny, did you brush your teeth? I did it already. Come on, Billy. Time for bed. Coming, Mum. Put that down, Johnny. Come on. Time for bed. Oh, where'd that come from? Camilla and I made it at school. Ugh. That doesn't look right. It really works, I swear. We already asked it all sorts of stuff. Come on, I'll show you. All right. What should I ask? I don't know. Whatever you want. Okay. My sister and I want to know... Are there any spirits here that want to communicate with us? Is Dad ever coming home? Are there any spirits here who can answer my question? Don't worry about it. It's just a stupid game. It isn't real. Why're you pounding on the door? I'm not. You're barmy. You know, she's pushing the boundary, isn't it? She says she wasn't smoking. I don't think you should agonize over it, Peg. God knows I had my share of fags at school, didn't you? Oh, lots. But it's not what she did that bothers me. It's that, she don't listen to what I say anymore, Pegs. Just a phase, isn't it? I mean, I can punish her, but then I feel guilty because I know it's not really her fault. She loves her dad and she took it very hard when he left. Poor thing. But I can't just let it go either, can I? I'm loath to ask, but have you told Richard about it? I would, if I ever saw him. Sod. Now, it's like I'm having to do both jobs. I'm half the mum I was before. I'm just rubbish, Peggy. You are not, Peggy. You're too hard on yourself. - Ooh! - Oh! - This sodding house! - Oh! We are back with real life ghost hunters, Ed and Lorraine Warren, talking about their experiences at the Amityville house. And now we're gonna talk to my next guest, Dr. Steven Kaplan, who says that the investigations the Warrens conducted into the Amityville haunting is a load of hogwash. Why is that? Well, it's been well established that Amityville was a blatant hoax. - But that hasn't stopped-- - That's never been proven. Yes, it has. The Lutz family made everything up so they could profit off of all the publicity. That's just not true. Look, we see this all the time. It's very easy to sit on the outside and pick apart their story. But it's something very different to have been there and experienced it for yourself. I don't need to go to the moon to know that it's not made out of green cheese. Listen, Ed Warren's never seen a house that he didn't think was haunted. And by the time his wife is done blowing smoke and ringing bells they've got everybody else believing in ghosts, too. What exactly are you a doctor of, anyway? Come on, Warren. Try and show a little class, will you? I'm not gonna show class to somebody who's sitting here telling lies about my wife and me. - Be careful who you call a liar. - What are you gonna do about it? We go on these shows to inform people. But every time I open my mouth, another one of these little-- - Ed. - Ass... Academics... Pops up. Tries to undo everything we've done. - Could you please take a breath? - I know. I know. I know. I'm counting to 10. I'm counting to 10! All right, Billy. You ready to do a speech? There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixp... It's all right. We'll just try again. You ready? He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse. And they all lived together in a little crooked house. Good boy! You're getting so good. Now you may have a biscuit. Biscuit! All right. Come on. Off to bed with you. - Night, Mom. - Good night, darling. Now, don't eat too many of those or you'll wake up thirsty in the middle of the night. All right? I won't. You promise? - Night, boys. - Night, Mom. No. Help. Stop it. No. Janet? - Please. - Janet? Janet, wake up! You're dreaming. This is my house. No. No, it's not. Go away. Who are you? What are you doing here? Playing a game with Billy. Leave Billy alone. Janet, who are you talking to? You have to go away. You're the one trespassing. Janet, wake up. I'll tell my mum if you don't stop. I'll break her neck. No, please. Dying with Billy. No. Janet. Janet, it's all right. It's all right, come on. Go back to sleep. Stay away from Billy! Leave us alone. You hear me? Janet, what are you doing? There's no one here. This is my house. Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! Billy? What's wrong? There's someone in my tent! What? There's someone in my tent! Mummy. See? Nothing. You just had a bad dream. That's all. Go to your room. Oh, my God. Janet! You nearly gave me a heart attack. What're you doing down here? I think I've been sleepwalking again. What do you mean "again"? You all right? You're burning up. Come on. Come on, let's get you back upstairs, eh? Think you better stay home from school tomorrow. Come on. Let's get you back into bed, eh? You know I want to be a hair artiste and become a credible painter. Don't give me any of your brute hype and airy-fairy hair... -...back 30 years. - Now, I've gone back to the age of 10. Everything is shot in soft focus. Some bogus excuses. When're you gonna leave that posh school, eh? And get yourself a proper man's job down-- Yes, a Christmas carol. - Which one? - All of them. And within minutes-- Mr. Chairman, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. I stand before you tonight, in my Red Star chiffon evening gown. Hodgson residence. Oh. Hi, Mum. Yeah, a little. I just ate, so I'm not really that hungry. Yeah. I'm here. Do you know when you'll be home? All right. Bye, Mum. Yes, I am an iron lady. The Iron Lady of the Western world. No, no. You are a bad one, you know, you. Mother dearest, I'm sorry I am late. But I had to stop off to get you a health-giving brown loaf. I do not wish to hear about that sort of thing. I want you to come over here, if you don't mind me, and let your old mum scrape the fluff out of your belly button. Nice and clean for the big parade and very good on Sunday. I shall be there, you know, watching you. My house! You're up early. Hey. Yeah, I couldn't sleep. You get inspired? I don't know if I'd call it that. I had this crazy dream. Saw this thing. When I woke up... Couldn't get it out of my head. So, thought maybe this might help. Hey, I know I'm no Picasso, but I didn't think it was that bad. We need to stop. We could still do the lectures, but no new cases. At least not for a little while. All right. Uh... Could I ask why? Because if it's the TV shows and publicity then we won't do that. - Good morning. - Good morning. Morning. Do you trust me? You know I do. Then please trust me now. Okay. Oh. What are you doing that for? In case I go sleep walking again. Mum? Johnny? Janet! What's wrong? What is it? There's someone in the room! There's no one! What you talking about? - There's someone in our room! - What! Our beds are shaking up and down! Janet, I swear to God if you're making it up-- I got bit. I'm not lying! He bit me! Look! Oh, my God. Have you two been playing with this? Taking turns scaring the wits out of each other? No wonder I can't get a good night's sleep! - But, Mum-- - No! I don't wanna hear another word. Now get back to bed, the lot of you! Help us! - Please help! - Help! Peggy! Vic, open the door! Open the door! I've seen it with my own eyes. The bloody thing went clear across the room. But-- - Well, then... - What? Well? It's cold. Well, I've been through the house. Top to bottom. There's no one there. What about Margaret and Janet's room? Did you-- No, no. I looked there, every room. Even went down the basement. There's no one there. What's he doing? We've taught him to ring the bell when he wants to go. Do you wanna let him out, Billy? Look! The police are at our house! Now, what they doing here? - Oh, I called them. - What? Well, I mean, it's got to be somebody playing a joke on you, right? It's got to be. Yeah. So, ma'am. You didn't actually see the man yourself? No. But I don't think she's making it up. Not anymore. Well, look. There has to be some sort of explanation. Sir, that's why we're here, okay? Bring me a chair from the kitchen. It's coming from inside the wall. Then what? Mice, maybe? Big bloody mouse. Well, there's nothing we can do about that. We can file an incident report and we'll stand by it if anyone asks. But that's about all. A report? Oh. That's brilliant. Every problem I have, there's another bloody form to fill out! Oh, for God's sake. Listen. I think this is a bit beyond us. The priest at our church is a family friend. I'll ask him to call on you. ...to us and tell us that... There are still some honest people left in the world. And she said, what happened was, that she was at the grocery store. She left her wallet there, at the grocery store. It had money in it, a lot of money. And she thought, "Well, that's that. It's gone." She thought someone was just gonna pick it up. That's it, that's that. But just to see what she could do, she went back to the grocery store and sure enough. Some honest woman had picked up the wallet and returned it to the manager there. She got everything back. She got her money. She got everything that was in the purse. Judy? Honey... What's wrong? Mom. Who's that? Go back. Who are you? Tell me who you are! - Mom! Mom. Mom! Wake up! - No! What do you want? I'm sorry, Lorraine. Are you okay? I'm okay. Mrs. Hodgson. Yes? My name's Kent Allen. We're with the television news program Wide Angle. I was hoping to have a word with you about the disturbance at your home last week. How'd you find out about that? The police constables filed an incident report. It's... Well, it's raised a few eyebrows. I'd rather not have my business spread all over the telly, if you don't mind. Good day! Is it still happening? Because if it is getting your side of the story out might be your best chance of finding help. This thing on? Okay. Behind the doors of this seemingly normal house in Ponders End, North London, is a family living in a nightmare. I look up, and through the window, plain as day, I see the younger girl, Janet, being thrown around in the air like she was floating. So we run back inside and sure enough there's little toy LEGO bricks flying all around the room. One of them hit me right in the face so hard it drew blood. I saw the chair slide by itself, across the floor, a distance of several feet. I checked the chair for wires, but could find nothing to explain it. Maurice Grosse is an engineering consultant and has been investigating these claims for the Society of Psychical Research. Well, I don't think there's any doubt about it at all. The sheer number of documented incidents in this case is absolutely staggering. But, Anita Gregory, a parapsychologist and lecturer at the Polytechnic of North London, is not convinced. Our principal characters here are all children. And children can be very ingenious pranksters. At the center of these frightening activities is 11-year-old Janet Hodgson. I recently interviewed Janet and her 14-year-old sister, Margaret. What happened next will astonish you. How does it feel living in a haunted house? I don't know. You don't get used to it. You see, we was just a normal family before all this. It's been getting worse since Mr. Grosse started talking to it. How do you mean? Like, asking it questions. Saying knock twice for "yes" and one for "no." That sort of thing. I wonder what would happen if we tried talking to it now? Is anybody there? Is anybody there who wishes to communicate? I say again, is anybody there? Nothing. Well, it isn't a jukebox, is it? Janet, are you all right? Janet? Mmm. Janet. Janet, are you feeling all right? Stop calling me Janet! Isn't that your name? Janet's asleep... And I'm talking. Well, what should I call you? What is your name? You don't belong here. My name is Maurice Grosse. Who are you? This is my home. Get out now! No. This is not your house. Now, what's your name? Knock, knock. Very well. Who's there? Bill. Bill. Bill. Bill. Bill who? My name is Bill Wilkins and I'm 72 years old. Where do you come from? I come from the grave. How did you die? I went blind and had a hemorrhage. And I fell asleep and I died in the chair in the corner. Why have you come here? I like to hear them scream. Why don't you just leave us alone? Shut up, you old cow! Janet, darling. Darling, are you all right? I'm sorry. Janet. Peggy, what am I gonna do? Oh... You don't need to think about it tonight. And you and the kids can stay here as long as you like. Mum. Billy, aren't you supposed to be getting ready for bed? I thought you might like some biscuits. Oh... Oh, thank you! There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse... Baron? Baron? There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile. Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum! - What happened? What is it? - The Crooked Man! What? Crooked what? What are you talking about, darling? - The Crooked Man! - Calm down! Just tell me what happened. - What? - What is it? I don't know. I think he's been walking around-- The crooked man stepped forth and rang the crooked bell. And thus his crooked soul spiralled into a crooked hell. Murdered his crooked family and laughed a crooked laugh. Janet! Janet? Oh, my God! No! Someone get an ambulance! This is my home. Get out now. No. This is not your house. Now, what's your name? Knock, knock. Very well. Who's there? Bill. Bill. Bill. Bill. Bill who? My name is Bill Wilkins and I'm 72 years old. What do you make of that voice? He sounds confused. Is he senile? The voice on this tape is coming from an 11-year-old girl. The family's reached out to the Church for help? Yes. But truthfully, we've been reluctant to get involved. The case has turned into a media circus over there. They're calling it "England's Amityville." Great. You're afraid it's a hoax. The Church's ability to help people depends on its reputation. So, what do you want us to do? We'd like you to fly to London for three days to act as our unofficial eyes and ears. Now, you don't have to do anything. If it is a hoax, you just turn around and leave. But if it's not... Then there is a family in London that desperately needs our help. Thank you for your faith in us. - All right. Well, just let me know. - Okay. I told him we'd talk about it. There's nothing to talk about. Honey, you heard him. They don't want us to get involved. Just observe and report back. There have always been cases we've turned down. There has never been a family that we've refused to help. I had a vision in Amityville. It was the same one I had seven years ago. I had a premonition of your death. Wait. That's why you locked yourself away for eight days? You saw my death? You've seen it, too. The demon in your painting is real. We have both seen the same inhuman spirit. It's a warning. If we keep doing this, you are going to die. Your visions are a gift from God. And if God is showing you my death, then he's doing it for a reason. Maybe you're meant to prevent it from happening. Come on. We don't run from fights. If we go... If we do this... You have to promise me that we're just there to observe. If anything turns out dangerous in any way, we're gonna tell the Church, and we're gonna get out. Promise me. Promise me, Ed. I promise. Mr. and Mrs. Warren, I'm Maurice Grosse. Thank you so much for coming. I believe you're gonna be staying at the Hodgsons' house. Is that right? Always better to be in the mix. Oh, yeah. I agree. You didn't have to do this. - So kind of you. - It was a complimentary... This is it. Thank you very much. - How you doing? You all right? - I'm all right. How are the kids? Yeah. They're fine. Here we are. There we go. Ed, we've managed to capture some amazing things. I think you'll be very impressed when you see. Great. I'd like to listen to those tapes again, too. You've got some really interesting stuff in there. Vic Nottingham. Hi, Vic. How are you? Ed Warren. Hello, Ed. How are you? And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson. - Nice to meet you. Ed Warren. - How do you do? - This is my wife, Lorraine. - How do you do? - Hello. - Hello. Well, I'll be off then, Peg. Will you tell the kids I said hello? Yeah. Of course, I will. Nice to meet you. - Nice meeting you. - You too, hon. - So, here we are, Peggy. - All right. Do come in. It's just me and Janet here now. My other kids are staying with them. This is where the girls used to sleep, but we don't use it anymore. Why not? Well, most of the activity centered in this room. We were quite afraid that someone might get hurt, which is why we keep it locked. I understand that Janet has levitated. Did that happen in here as well? - Yeah, more than once. - Yeah. We've got photographs of that as well. I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story from her, if you don't mind. The neighbors donated them and I hung them up, hoping they'd keep things from moving around. Has it worked? No. We can hear it all night. Hi, there. I'm Lorraine. Mind if I have a seat? Do you know why I'm here? Well, your mom has told me about what's been going on and I'm here to help, if I can. Would you like to talk about it? You know, when I was about your age, um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital and I saw an angel. Yeah. It was standing next to a little boy's bed. It was just gently touching his cheek and then it stopped. And it looked right at me. Of course, my mom and the nurses did not believe me, but I knew it was real. Look, I know how it is. I know what it's like to lose your friends because you're different. But I also know that one person can change everything. And you just have to open up to them. How did you know you could trust the people you opened up to? I didn't. Sometimes I got hurt. And it took a long time, but I finally found someone who believed me. What did you do then? I married him. I'm just so tired. I can't sleep here. I used to go to the medical room at school and they let me sleep there because I was so worn out. But now I can't even do that. Everyone's afraid of me. I got no friends. No place I can go to. It makes me feel like I'm not normal. You know, whatever is doing this to you wants you to feel this way. But why? Because that's what makes it stronger. Around the time this all started, Janet started waking up here in the middle of the night. This is the spot that Janet said Bill Wilkins died, right here. Where'd you get it from? Uh... My ex-husband bought all the furniture with the house when we moved in. If you don't mind me asking... Uh, is your ex-husband still in the picture? Nope. I'm sorry to hear that. Any chance of reconciliation? He had twins with a woman from round the corner. So I'm gonna take that as a "no." - Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with. - Hmm. He took all the music the day he left. I know it must feel like that sometimes-- No. I mean, literally. He took all the records. My kids used to love listening to his Elvis collection. - They've been through so much. - Hmm. And now, all this is happening on top. Yeah. The timing isn't a coincidence. Negative entities often feed off emotional distress. They like to kick you when you're down. That hardly seems fair. No, it really isn't. Do you know when the voice is gonna speak? Sometimes. And when it does, does it feel like it's coming from inside you? No. More like it's coming from behind me. Like I'm being used. Does it ever say things just to you? That only you can hear? What does it say? It said it wants to hurt you. When did it say that? Right now. Do we really need that? We'd like to be able to prove to the Church that she's not making the voice herself. So, by holding the water in her mouth, we'll be able to show that it's not some form of ventriloquism. Does she have to be in the chair? Just... It makes me sick to see her sitting there like that. We know it's hard, but the spirit has shown an attachment to this spot. It'll be easier for Ed to contact it if she's sitting there. You'll be all right. You ready for this? I guess so. It's December the 21st, 1977. This is Ed and Lorraine Warren, sitting with Peggy and Janet Hodgson. Also present is Maurice Grosse. All right. Let's get started. If there's something here that would like to communicate with us, we're all ears. Speak up. What do you want with this girl and her family? It says it won't talk with you all looking at me like this. Strange! I wonder why not? It's not been shy about talking up until now. How about if we all turn our backs? Think it'll speak if we do that? Maybe. Well... Let's try this again. So what do you think, Bill? We've given you your privacy. Now come on out and talk to us. Here I come. Am I talking to the spirit that's oppressing this family? Is that what I am? Is that what I'm doing? Yes. And I have come to put a stop to it. Do you know who I am? Ed. Eddie. Edward. Ed is fine. Your father called you Edward. Not true. My father called me Ed, just like everybody else. Come on, Bill. You're not a psychiatrist and I'm not here to talk about my father. Let's get down to business, what do you say? Hmm? Why don't you just leave these people alone? Because this is my house! It's not your house. Yes, it is. I come here to see my family, but they're not here now. That's because you're dead. If your family did live here, they're long gone now. Where are they? I don't know. If I did, maybe I could help you. I don't need your help. Then why don't you just move on? I don't believe in that. Why not, hmm? What would be so wrong with going to heaven? I am not a heaven man! Well, I got news for you, Bill. You see, I don't care what you believe in. You see this? Help... it... let... go. Help... It... Let... Go! Are you sensing a presence? No, just the opposite. I'm not sensing anything. We could be looking at hysterical neurosis. That would explain the multiple personalities and hallucinations. That doesn't feel right, either. Well... I can't explain it. My heart is telling me to believe them. I heard that voice with my own ears, but all I can sense is their own fear. I can't seem to see beyond that. I don't think I can sleep this far away from you. Well, you're gonna. It'll give you something to look forward to when we get home. Oh, love. I wish you wouldn't do that. It helps me sleep. At least I know I'm not going anywhere. I didn't smoke, Mum. Eh? That day with Camilla at school. I was holding the cigarette, but I wasn't going to take a puff. I swear. I just wanted to look cool in front of her. It was stupid. Oh, love. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. Oh, darling. Help! Help! Hmm. Janet! Ah! Janet? Oh, my God. Janet? Janet? - Help! - Janet? Janet! Please help me! Mum! Please! Mum! - Janet! - Help! Get me out! There's somebody in here! I can't open it! Mum! Help me! Janet! Janet! - What's going on? - There's someone in there with Janet! I can't get it open! Get the key. Go get the key now! Janet! Hold on! We're coming! I got the key! I got the key! Okay. Okay. Come on. Janet, we're coming! Janet. Get it off her! Please get it off her! What was that? There was someone in here! I saw him with me own eyes. He did this to my girl. This is the bite wound Janet received the first night. It's faded a bit here, but you can still make it out. Wow. That's pretty distinctive. Two missing teeth. That's right. And it's too big for one of the children. You think this was the spirit? This Bill Wilkins? I tracked down the home owner. And it turns out, the owner's father lived there. His name was William Wilkins and he died of a hemorrhage in the brain in that chair. Everything she said is true. All public information, by the way. She could have heard the whole story from a neighbor. And what about the claims that Janet has been teleporting around the house in her sleep? About as valid as their claims of her levitating off the bed. Were any of you there when it happened? No. But I have pictures of that too. Yeah. There you go. I set my camera up in the girls' room and then waited downstairs with the remote control. And fired it off whenever I heard any commotion. I have to admit. The way her knees are bent, the upright position of her body. It looks like she's just jumping. What are you saying? I mean, you were there last night. You saw it with your own eyes. Well, Peggy was the one who saw someone attacking Janet. But she teleported herself into a room locked from the outside, for goodness' sake. And what about her voice? How do we explain that? I think the first time she was making that voice it was in front of television cameras. And she couldn't do it with water in her mouth until you looked away. So she could have spit it out, taken another sip before you turned back. Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family pretending to be possessed by demons. Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the demons or the people who prey on our willingness to believe in them. The demons are worse. But you must admit, it is suspicious. You sincerely believe that she's faking everything? And what about Peggy? She's just using the whole thing as an excuse to get better housing from the council. She's already applied! Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax. Sometimes, what we do requires a leap of faith. To believe when nobody else will. So you really do believe them? Yes. We do. But the Church can't do anything without proof. That's what we need. Right, listen. I'll make some telephone calls, see if I can get hold of some video recording equipment. In the meantime, Ed and I can be spending time with Peggy and the kids, because they need to be a family again. Hi, Mom! We're back! What are you doing back? What's all this, then? Mr. and Mrs. Warren bought us some vinyls. They got us an Elvis record! Oh, Blue Hawaii. Hope you don't mind. A little American culture. Not at all! Janet! Billy. I missed you. Hey, guys, I missed you. So, have any of you ever been bothered by a bully? Pete, at school. He's always picking on Billy. And, dear, tell me, what do you do when that happens? They stick up for me. Good, because the spirit in this house - is a lot like that bully. - Yes. And he's got it in for Janet. So you guys gotta stick up for her, the same way they stick up for you. Family sticks together. This, on the other hand, is a lost cause. Oh, bloody hell. We've had all sorts of things stop working - for no reason at all. - Mmm. We're gonna have music in here one way or another. Whose guitar is that? Oh, it was Dad's, but he said I could have it. Yeah, do you mind? No. I'm a little rusty, so you gotta promise not to laugh. Especially you. Wise men say only fools rush in Thank you. Hey, don't laugh now. But I can't help falling in love with you. Shall I stay? Would it be a sin if I can't help falling in love with you? Like a river flows surely to the sea, darling so it goes, some things are meant to be. Everybody now. Take my hand, take my whole life too, for I can't help falling in love with you. For I can't help falling in love with you. Thank you very much. It's so small and light. Why do you do this? Help people like us? When you were little, did you ever worry that there might be something hiding under your bed at night? Yeah? Well... My bed actually had something under it. Yeah. Something grabbed my hand and yanked me right to the floor. It was too dark to see under there, but let me tell you, I ran out of there so fast. You know what my dad did? He dragged me right back into the room and told me I had to face my fears. And I was scared to death. But then I remembered what this nun had told me in catechism. "God will be there for all who need." So, I grabbed this crucifix out from my nightstand, right? And I tell whatever's under there that it better leave, or God was gonna kick its butt. Best thing my dad ever did for me. Of course he only did it because he really didn't believe me. It took me years to finally find someone who did. And you know what I did then? You married her? So you've heard this story before? All right. How you getting on in here? Hey. We're done here. Fixed the closet door, too. And if you'd like, I could take a look at the washing machine. No, I couldn't ask you to do that. It's a disaster down there. Come on. How bad can it be? Oh. Bloody hell. Everything still quiet in there? Yes. Thank goodness. Yes. It would be something though, wouldn't it? If we were able to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a life beyond this? It would be historic. Is that why you're doing this? Because you want to be a part of something historic? This isn't a laboratory, this is someone's house. And I think helping that family is the only thing that matters. No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. My daughter died in a car crash several years ago. Afterwards, I started to experience things. I think she wanted to communicate with me. And, yes, it would help if I knew that she was... I don't know. Somewhere. That's not it. Oh, great. Think I found it. All right. It's right here. Come and get it. Margaret! Johnny, come and get it. Okay. Think I got it. All right. There we go. What's that? Ed? There's... There's something behind you. What is it? Oh, Jesus! Whoa! Peggy! Peggy! He grabbed me. It was him. He tried to pull me under. Oh, my God! Look! Oh God, you're scratched. That's not a scratch, that's a bite mark. He bit me. Just like he did Janet. Aw. Hey, Janet, can you get me another one? Yeah. Janet? What's wrong? Don't you see it? See what? In the kitchen. Tell me what you see. It's playing with the knives, hiding in the dark. Johnny! Johnny, what you doing? Johnny, no! Johnny, don't go! Remember what Mr. Warren said? We can't let it bully us. This is our house. Johnny. Johnny, please come back. What's the matter? What's happened? Janet's gone! She was just right here! Come on. No! - Mum! - Johnny! Ed? What's going on? Mum. Mum, Johnny's in there! No! Johnny! Johnny! Step back. Come on. Where are they? Where are they? Johnny? Johnny? Darling! Oh, darling, come here. Are you all right? It's all right, darling. It's all right. Where's Janet? Where's Janet? Janet! Guys, I'm picking up something in here. Ed, watch the... Me... Won't... Me... Won't... Me... Janet. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Come on. Come on, now. It's okay. Watch out. Look out. - Slowly! - Okay. Darling, it's all right. It's all right, Mum's here. Mum's here, darling. How did she get in there? It's all right, darling. What's that? It's fine. Can I, uh... What is it? She's faking it. What? I have proof. So much for your leap of faith. What? My girl didn't make this up. I've seen things. She was caught red-handed faking an event. No, it's not possible. Have you seen it in there? How could a 12-year-old girl throw a table across the room? It's over. Do you understand? For the sake of your daughter, don't make this harder than it already is. She couldn't have pulled this off alone. Oh, how dare you. What, you think I put her up to this? What about the police? Are they in on this, too? No, it's all right. What about you two? You believe us, don't you? We wanna help. But the Church will take one look at that video and that'll be the end of it. They'll wanna distance themselves from anything that remotely resembles a hoax. I'd like you to leave, please. Now, go on, get out. Get out, the lot of you! Get out! Perhaps, you could somehow reach out to the spirit. You know, make contact with it yourself. I can't. Believe me, I've tried. I'm sorry, I'm just not sensing anything here. So, that's it, then? You hold out a lifeline to them and then you just throw it away? We don't like this any more than you do. We'll tell the Church about everything we've seen. But, the only piece of concrete evidence we've got, is a video of Janet faking an incident. Yeah, but there have been literally dozens of genuine incidents. You might want this. And, just because she faked it this once, doesn't change the fact that-- No, it changes everything. We're agents of the Church here. They'd be calling us home even if Peggy hadn't asked us to leave. You've done really good work here, Maurice. You were here for them when no one else was. Uh, thank you. But, sometimes you need to make a leap of faith. Believe when nobody else will. This doesn't feel right. I know. Have a safe trip. Did you really do it? Wreck the kitchen and all that? But, why? It said it would kill you, if I didn't make them leave. Don't you think it's a little convenient that she just happened to fake an incident in the one room of the house that had a video camera pointing at it? Yeah. No. Oh, damn it. Lorraine. Help me set up these tape recorders. Thread it through and start it from the top. All right. Remember those strange, garbled messages we got from Janet? - You know, from Bill? - Yes. There were two of them, right? Here's the first one. Help! It... Let go! Help! It... Let... Go! We thought he was referring to himself, right? - Yes. - Listen to the second one. Me... Won't... Me... Won't... Me... If I'm right about this... Help me! It won't let me go! Help me! It won't let me go! I come here to see my family. But they're not here now. I think, I'd like to go now. - But I can't. - Why not? It wants her. So badly. It almost has her. Tell me how to stop it. I'm given and I'm taken. I was there at your first breath. You didn't ask for me. But I'll follow you till death. Wait. I don't understand. Please... Oh, God! You're bleeding! What is happening? The old man's spirit is just a pawn. He's been enslaved to where he's to weaken Janet's will. Enslaved? Enslaved by who? Something inhuman. Something that's taken a blasphemous form to attack my faith. There is a demonic presence in that house. You need to get Vic before he leaves. We need to go back. Okay. Mom, help me, please! Mom! Please, Mom, help me! Help! For God's sake, leave us alone! Margaret! Margaret, no! Come on, let's get out of here! Come on, let's get out! - Go to Peggy's house! - What, you're not coming? I can't leave Janet! - No! Janet! - Mum! Janet! Well, I don't understand it. I mean, first you say it's not real, now it is. Her sight was being blocked by the inhuman spirit. The old man's spirit couldn't break through until we left that house. Everything they've experienced has been a manifestation of the demonic. The Old Man, the Crooked Man, they're just a facade, trying to keep us from seeing the real evil in that house. In my vision, he wanted to help me, but he was too afraid. And he kept speaking in a kind of riddle. Something like, uh, "I am given and I am taken. "I was there at your first breath. "You didn't ask for me. "But I will follow you until your death." Your name. You didn't ask for it. It was given, when you were born. That's it! Knowing the demon's name gives us power over it and we can cast it out. Yeah, sure, but we don't know its name. But, maybe we do. Huh? Why else would he give us that clue? He must think that we know it somehow. So, what do you do now? An inhuman spirit powerful enough to cloud Lorraine's sight is more than a match for me. We need to get Janet to the Church before it kills her. Janet! What happened? Janet! Janet! Thank God you're here. - Janet's in there! - Come on! Damn it. Huh? - Ed! Are you okay? - Yeah! I'm gonna go around back! No! Ed! No! Ed, no, no, no. I'm gonna come with you! - Peggy, stay here. - Janet! - Wait in the car with the kids! Wait! - Janet! Janet! Get in the car. Go in, go on. You, too, Peggy. Come on! Ed? Ed? Ed? No! Come on! Ed! It won't open! Let me try. - We need to break it down! - All right. - Wait here. - Break it! Ed, hon, wait right there. Wait. Vic'll be right back. I can't wait. I'm going on ahead. No, Ed, don't! Stop! You can't fight this alone. She needs our help! Ed, please. Please, just wait for me. Please wait for me. I can't lose you. I am so scared. I know. Me, too. But I have to help her. But, what about my vision? I know I made a promise to you, hon, but I have to do this. I love you, Lorraine. Ed, no! No! Stop! Don't! Ed! No! No. Stop. Ed! Someone! Help! Move. Oh, God. Janet, where are you? Come on! Help! Janet! Janet! Help me! Janet! In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. What's your name? What's your... What's your name? I do know your name. I asked you. Tell me who you are! And you told me. You told me your name. And I wrote it down. I need my Bible! Why? What's happening? What... The demon's name gives us power over it. V. A. L. A. K. Valak. Janet! Janet? There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile. He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile. He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse. And they all lived together in a little... Vic! Vic! Let me through. - No, wait, Lorraine, let me try. - I'm going! No! Let me go in. Lorraine! Ed! Lorraine! Lorraine! Ed! Janet? Janet! No! No! I got you. Come on. No! Janet. Ed! Ed! Ah! Ed! Lorraine! Ed! Your name gives me dominion over you, demon. And I do know your name! You are Valak! The defiler. The profane, the marquis of snakes! In the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, I condemn you back to hell! No! Ed! Come on! Ed! Okay. We're good. Okay. - Ed, are you okay? - No, check on her. Janet? Oh, my God! Is she all right? I'll call an ambulance. Janet, sit up, darling. Sit up. Here you go now. Take a big, deep breath. Big, deep breath. There you go. You all right? He'll be fine. - Does she look all right? - Yeah, she's fine. You saved her. No. You saved us. Didn't I tell you it was meant to be? But you believed in me. I couldn't have done it without you. Thanks for coming back for us. Oh. Aw. Here, sit down. Sit down. You know... This has kept me safe since I was a kid. I want you to have it. And, when you grow up, you find someone who needs it, you give it to them. Deal? I'm so lucky. You said one person could change everything. But... I've got two. Oh. Okay. Tell me about the beginning, the first night of your happening. - What was your brother doing? - Brothers playing and fooling about. I wasn't quite sure, no. - They were scared? - Yeah, petrified. Janet? What about Janet? When it comes from your area, Janet, do you feel anything in your throat? - No. - You just don't feel anything? Now, I'm looking at Janet. Don't fight in here. And the voice comes from her, but her mouth doesn't move and nothing moves. Turn it off! I know-- Janet, can you tell when the voice is gonna come through you? No. No, I don't ever. You know who I am? Do you know what my name is? Yeah. Ed. Ed! Were you a Christian? No! You know it! What year did you die? Do you remember? Yeah. I'm dead. Sixty-one. Nineteen sixty-one.
