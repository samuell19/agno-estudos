Journal entry, October 13, 1995. All of my research has led me to this day. The sound events are not uniformly spread out, but my Tesla theories have given me a reasonably accurate time table. There'll be increased solar activity in the next few days, which should be powerful enough for what I need. It's ironic that the ancient science I'm using is viewed so skeptically, since it's infinitely more powerful than today's science. The worst part of this is that I know that all the time that I'm spending away is very painful for my daughter Paula, but I don't see any other way. Hopefully I'll find what I'm looking for and be home soon. I've spent ages going over my dad's work since he disappeared. All the far-out, crazy theories. And now, I have just one last thing to do. I'm going back to the one place I swore I'd never return to, my hometown. Shasta, California... 'land of the weird'. Well hey, can I help ya? Can I help ya? Lori. Honey. Honey, come here, come here quick, come here! Lori! This is Baker, show me 10-10 at Miller's Road and Wood's Creek Line by the snowplow shed. Careful out there, Sheriff. Copy that. Checking to make sure you weren't followed by Bigfoot? Nice to see you - 'Pig'. I was just about to write you a note, good to see you, Paula. Good to be here, Sheriff Sam. Yeah well, Unibomber called and wants his clothes back. No one knows, right? Nope. And here. Somebody at the newspaper found this in the archives. Hardly ever saw him smile. Thanks. How often? Every four to six hours, and getting closer. So what's been happening? Folks are scared, say they're seeing things. What do you mean? It's complicated, I'll save it for the walk. Thank you for giving me a hand. I've just been grasping at straws here, so I really appreciate your... Bringing the whole airy-fairy approach to this? Yeah well, you know the town. Half of them in yoga pants on cloud nine, the other half loading their guns. They need to rule out cloud nine and get everyone thinking logically again. Look, before you say anything, don't blame Sam because she told me not to come. But I had to see you, I just had to. I blurted something. Paula, what happened? You just left, and I'm sorry but that was really hard for me. So I had to see you. Meredith... What're you doing here? Seriously? Don't look at me, I didn't tell anyone, really. Paula? Someone told me you were dead. Charlie, how did you know we were here? I saw Meredith drive by and I followed her. You what? What, who comes out here anymore? Everyone thinks this place is haunted. It looked weird, and yeah, I was worried, so I followed you. Why didn't someone tell me? I swear to god, this town. Paula. Look, we'll take off and maybe we can hang out later. Yeah, let's all go to Dino's. No, Charlie, you can come by the house later if you want. How could you just shut out your friends like that? It's been 10 years. 12. Really harsh, Paula. What happened? Anyway, we intruded, we're sorry, and we'll get out of here. Right, Charlie? What, why, no, we just got here! Welcome back to. "True Tales From the Darkness." Our next story, a bizarre tale of true identity theft. Here's Rick Mos. Alicia? Is she doing the pose from her TV show? Kill me now. Alicia Garcia, it is so good to see you. Your new show is amazing, I've seen them all. What're you doing here? She's been listening to the police band again. Cops have to check in and you gave your exact location. Who are you working for now? That 'Alien' whatever show? Or have you moved straight on to porn? Yeah, now that you've been fired by how many networks? Lawsuits are expensive, huh? What are you blogging now? Vlogging, I'm self-funded. So cute. I have 12 million followers and I do just fine. But you wouldn't understand that, would you. Paula - my research team told me I'd find you here. Nice to see you, Alicia, drive safely on your way back to Hades. Yeah, if you came for another expose, you're gonna have to turn right back around. I came for something more important than that. Which is? You're learning to color inside the lines? You know, I've just been following this 'Sound' phenomenon all over the world, and who'd have thought that it would bring me right back to my cute little hometown of Mount Shasta? Home of - 'The Shasta Triangle'. Has a nice ring to it, right? I've heard you've met Shatner. What is the strangest thing you've seen with your own eyes? Come on Charlie, she's just here because she wants something. What is it, Alicia? You know, quite a coincidence Paula, showing up exactly 23 years to the day that your Dad disappeared. Yeah, I checked, and word on the street is that DARPA didn't manage to get all of your Daddy's research years ago. I thought you said your Dad didn't work for DARPA. Wait, what's DARPA again? It's the Pentagon's secret think tank. Their science is 20 to 30 years ahead of everything else. They created the Stealth Bomber, facial recognition, drones. Yeah, they didn't have time for cancer, climate change, world hunger. Anyway, there's a bunch of data missing from this book on meridian grids, timetables, gravitational wave applications, some Einstein-Tesla theory that Paula's Daddy had combined. Egypt and Atlantis stuff, Carlos Castaneda, but. A lot of it is in some ridiculous 'code'. This 'code' seems to have some sort of connection to the 'Sound' phenomenon but it's impossible to figure out. And there's this strange cryptic 'timetable'. Lay lines, hotspots. These sacred places, Charlie, are located where so-called meridians cross, 'power points'. And there's one right here in Mount Shasta. Isn't that right, Paula? Anyone with Google can find that. And my source at DARPA tells me that Paula's Dad figured out a way to combine these theories and do some incredible things. Look, I'm trying to be nice here Paula but, it's taking me forever to put this all together and I just want some answers. Well, let me just drop everything and help you, your highness. Come on, I have been all over the world with this data with some of the best minds, spent a ton of money, and nobody can break this code. You could probably unlock this whole thing in an hour. I don't have an hour. And I don't know how to tell you this but... It's time you are going. No, no, I'm not leaving. Yes, you are. Paula, give me one good reason why not. Your book - is a fake. No, I know my source is completely legit. Okay. Okay. Paula - here's my offer. I'll give you $25,000 of my own money to decode and explain this book on my show. I'll black out your face, warble your voice, change your name, whatever. No. No, why not? 100K, in cash, that's everything I have, vulture. This is a valuable opportunity and I'm willing to go all in. Why should I help you? I came here to do something with Sam. I don't need you, or your fake book. I don't even want your money. Oh please, take all her money. And embarrass her while you're at it if you can. Come on you guys, why not help her out? Thank you, Charlie. This could answer some real questions for you. And, make you a lot of money on your show. And put you back on the map. Doing what you do best, ruining decent people's lives. Look, I'm completely fascinated by all of this, just like you, and I wanna know how it all works and share it with the world. I can just follow you, you know. This is public land, you can't stop me. We would get to make fun of her, and it would give us someone our findings - publicly. No, I don't have time for this so, the price is 150,000. And I'll split it with Meredith, Sam, and Charlie. What, that's outrageous? Paula, you don't have to do that. 150,000. Okay, 120K, it's a nice, even number, good? Great, it's settled. And since you're all taking my money, you'll all be my witnesses. We'll go and do whatever it is that Paula and Sam are here to do, together. When we come back out, Alicia, you can have a full, exclusive, on-camera interview with me and everyone else, if they want. And we all get paid. And you'll explain the notebook. I'll decode, explain the setups, you name it. All on camera. Come on, we grew up in these woods. Grab some warm stuff from your car and let's go! Leave your phones and cameras in your car. What, you can't do that. Do what, the deal was to be interviewed for your show 'after' our time in the woods. I didn't say you could record it. Seriously!? That's the deal. Aw, and you got yourself all camera-ready. Disconnect for a few hours. It's amazing to live in the real world. That is such crap, come on. Phones don't work out there and neither does my walkie. What, no cavity search? Aren't you gonna leave your gun? No, why, are you afraid I might shoot you? I can't leave it unattended. Hey Paula, where're we headed? The hide and seek tree. All the way out there? Hey Alicia, how does all this science stuff work anyways? Well, since you're a true fan, Charlie, You remember that old board game, 'Snakes and Ladders', where if you landed on the right spot at the right time you could instantly move to another square on the board? Like where? Exactly - 'where'? All of these powerful energy meridians crisscross the Earth and intersect at hot spots. Priests and shamans used to put big things at them like pyramids. I think they used to use them as portals. Do people actually watch this show of yours? You know, just because I did better than the rest of you, and made something of my life. Our problem is what you made of yourself. Things good with you now, Sam? How's Rehab goin' for ya? You can't blackmail me, Garcia. Everyone who matters already knows my story. You shouldn't make her mad like that. Why? Because I've seen her break up bar fights before. She can get nasty. What makes you think I can't handle myself? Because you ran from every fight at school. I did not! Uh, Joanie Klumpers wanted to pound you for stealing her math homework, and you made me pick you up at the back of the school and cover you up in the back seat with a blanket. You ran from Klumpers? That is completely false. And maybe Charlie should tell you how she made out with Ronnie Simpson. The 'Mathlete'? Oh Charlie, that's so cruel. Be quiet, Alicia. And then, there was Tony, under the stairs. Shut up. The one that really takes the cake... Shut up! Diane Smith. I said, Shut up!! Whatever happened to her? How 'bout that abortion that you got senior year after Alders knocked you up? What? The Gym teacher? And 'boom goes the dynamite'. There it is, The Hide and Seek Tree. Sam, can you put the center stake here? Are we seconds away? From what? The 'Sound'. I thought that was debunked. None of them have been debunked. Not the one here or in Russia, or Ayers Rock, Egypt, none of them. That was an hour early. Is that on our time table? Wait, what do you mean? I don't feel so great. Charlie, your ears. Sit. There's something really going on here, isn't there? Let's look after Charlie, then we can talk about it. Take a minute to rest. I think I'll catch my breath and then head back guys, I don't feel so well. Are you sure? Maybe just rest, huh? Don't forget about the deal. If you don't stay, you don't get your share of the money. That wasn't part of the deal. Hey, it's my money, and I agreed to the terms you set, like no cameras. Why don't you just sit here for a minute and see how you feel. I really think I'll head back slowly, I'll be fine. I don't think you should. Yeah, stay for a bit. No, really, I, I don't feel good here! I promise I'll be fine. I don't care about any stupid deal, I'm leaving! I'll sleep in my car for a bit on my way, no, leave me alone!! What do you think? I'll go after her in a few minutes to make sure that she made it. You know how stubborn she is. So what's new in your world, Sam? No expose for you today, 'slick'. What about all the bizarre stuff happening around here. When you're a Cop, bizarre stuff happens all the time. Like, people disappearing, livestock missing and showing up where it shouldn't be? A jail cell full of mysterious vagrants, strange lights in the sky, crazy looking clouds? Sounds like just another day in Shasta. Messed up people end up in jail all the time. And sometimes people just leave town. And ask any farmer, there is no accounting for what animals do. And the lights in the sky are airplanes, satellites, and stars, and you can see anything you want in a cloud. Be honest, Garcia, do you actually believe any of this stuff, or are you just here to make a buck? I know we grew up in the land of weird, and when I started it was just a cool job. But, I've seen too much, and I know that there's more to our world than meets the eye. What do you think, Meredith? I don't know. How 'bout you two? Do you actually think any of this stuff is really possible? No, no, I don't think it's possible. Everything has a logic explanation. Sometimes it just takes a little extra effort to figure things out. Then what the hell is that!? What's going on? This isn't suppose to be happening. Charlie. Meredith was just gonna come get you. It's all right, sit down and I'll get you some water. No, I, I, I'm, I don't understand. I'm just gonna go... I'll take her back. Are you sure? It's all right, we'll take it slow. We'll keep setting up here. You're probably just run down. I was walking and then... I know how scary these woods can be. Don't worry, Sam and I will give you part of our share so you'll still get some of Alicia's money. I don't think that's Alicia. What? That's not her. Wow, you must be tired. She still seems like the same self-righteous, over-inflated jerk to me, right? Yeah. The sound is really nuts, huh? Reverend Jones thinks it has to do with The End Times. Oh, you're going to church now. Wow, it really has been a long time since we've hung out. And it's my fault, I'm gonna do a better job of staying in touch from now on, okay? You know, growing up was really tough on Paula. Yeah, what's with that? She doesn't like to talk about it but Sam told me that, though her Mother's death was listed as a car accident, it actually happened overseas. Really? No body was ever recovered, so she doesn't really know what happened to her Mom. And back in elementary school before we were all close, her Dad used to travel a lot. She'd be left with neighbors for weeks at a time. Where did he travel? Actually, a lot of those places in Alicia's book. After her Dad disappeared, the only silver lining if there is one is that after bouncing around to all those foster homes for all those years, she ended up with Sam and her Dad. I think Sam being her big sister was really good for both of them. Lucky. Yeah, lucky it turned out as good as it did. Someone's watching us. Charlie, you're freaking me out. Oh great, you talked some sense into her. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, this can't be happening. - No, this can't be happening. - Charlie, - Charlie, you're okay. - No, no, no, no. - No. - Look at me. This doesn't make any sense. - Look at me, Charlie. - No, no, no. No, no, no, no, and I don't wanna be here. I don't wanna, I don't wanna be here. No, I have to go the other way. - Charlie. - What happened? We went straight back on the path, that's what happened. Obviously you didn't. We did, and we came back right here. Oh, come on? What do you mean, "Come on?" We were walking back towards the cars. You used to get lost here playing hide and seek. I'm not playing hide and seek. I was walking back to the cars. Okay, stop it. I can't have you guys screwing around here, not today. What? Okay, just relax. Charlie and I can't both be taking wrong turns. Either we're both messed up or there's... Or, it's some sort of 'force' orchestrating this whole thing, some sort of intelligence. You don't know what you're talking about. Then fill us in. What's suppose to happen? This is just like that vortex place up in Washington state but more powerful, right? Or it's a DARPA experiment and you're using your Daddy's knowledge to pull off some sort of... I don't work at DARPA and never have so just drop that. Paula, we need to use our heads. Let's eliminate some possibilities. Agreed. It could be a magnetic thing, it could be a part of the path that looks similar, or just confusion. A government experiment. We don't have time for this. Sam, we need a good idea. Paula, you stay here. Why me? Just trust me. Charlie, you go a different way this time, Meredith too. Alicia and I will both go in different directions. We'll all leave the center point in four different directions, simultaneously. The first person back to their car, or any car, honk the horn once every 10 seconds. Listen for the sound of the horn and then head that direction. Once we're there, we'll figure out what happened here. You guys aren't messing around here, right? No one's messing around. But what if it doesn't work? It'll work, just get ready for a beer at Dino's. I'm buying. We'll just use our heads and we'll all figure this out together like a team, right? Paula is our anchor. We're gonna scout our way out of here together. Just listen for the sound of the car horn and head that way. Great, fantastic. Just keep walking straight, it's all gonna be okay. Straight ahead, it's just a bad dream, straight ahead. Oh, oh, okay. Keep your head on straight. Hello? Guys? Sam? I'm sorry Paula, I tried, I really did. Did you turn around? What? No, I, I kept walking straight, I promise. What, no car horns? Dammit, any car horns? I kept straight the whole way and by all rights I should be way over there. What? Not you too. What? I can't believe this! Paula, I don't know what to say, except... What? I, I, I, this is, I, Paula. No this can't be happening. What is going on here? So this is for real now, right? We're in some sort of a, a vortex. How do I know that this isn't some big stunt? What? That doesn't even make sense. Well neither does this. If you think we're playing a joke here, you are out of your mind. This is me, Sam. This is what we came here to figure out, one way or another. Right? Paula, wait! Paula! Paula! No! Paula. - This can't be right, can it? - It's okay. Something's happening and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. There has to be an explanation. We'll get to the bottom of it. Okay, cough it up. What did you come out here to do, what is all this? I'm paying for this party and I want answers. You knew this could happen, Paula. I don't think she did. That's true. I came out here to prove all of this wrong. And we will. Come on, now what? There wasn't suppose to be a 'now what'. But there is, and now Paula knows I was right and she was wrong. And I'd say she's highly motivated to figure it out. Charlie? Charlie!? Charlie!? Okay, we need the whole story. Just tell them, Paula. Paula, your ears are bleeding too. Okay, um, the day my Dad went missing, he had a talk with me. Even at 7, I knew this day was weird. He said he had to go, which you know, was upsetting because it was happening so often. My Dad and I, we used to camp out here sometimes. He taught me how to use the coat hanger here, some survival stuff, and his code. Before he left, he gave me the Notebook to keep it secret. So I put it in my jacket to hide later. But when he left, I was upset and I followed him on my bike. And I never saw him again. So, he disappeared, like Charlie just did? Paula and I have been in contact for a few months now. I reached out to her for a number of reasons. And you didn't tell me? Paula is a private person. And, around then, a lot of strange things were happening. I was getting a ton of calls. While I was trying to figure that out, Paula was trying to sort things out with her past. Yeah. I saw a shrink. I was trying to come to terms with my dad being gone. I was deep in the rabbit hole, hallucinating, believing things were happening that weren't. It took years to work through it all. By the time we reconnected, Paula wasn't so sure of the brilliance of her dad, and decided to come back here, face her fears where she last saw him. And the 'Sound' had something to do with it? Yeah, when it hit, I fell off my bike. Here? Yeah, I, I must've bumped my head and when I came to my Dad wasn't around. And you brought us here? And now we're stuck and Charlie's gone! We came out here to debunk this so that Paula could get on with her life. It wasn't her idea to have anyone else come along. I knew if I followed all of his directions to the letter and nothing happened, I would know for sure that this is all a fantasy. The delusions of the crazy Dad who abandoned me. But now we know it's not. How could I have known that? I'd rather believe that he was some jerk who took off on his daughter than believe whatever 'this' is. You have to be crazy to believe this is true. Or me. The point is, Paula got specific information from deciphering her Dad's Notebook. The real book. Today's date, this location, and a rough timetable. Where did you get your Notebook anyway? My contact at DARPA who told me that it belonged to your Dad, who gave it to him 23 years ago, before he disappeared. Well, let's take a look at both books and see what they can teach us. Maybe there's a breakthrough in them. You brought us out here to die. Huh. What? It isn't exactly a fake. We can fill in some of each other's blanks. Is this a map of our setup? So what do we do with this? I'll decode it all to be sure. Just in case. Can you grab mine out of my bag? Thanks. What is this? Alpha. Omega. And that one's Etnane. The Eye of Horus is down there. It says here, that the 'Sound' is created by expanding and contracting gravitational waves passing through us. Time speeds up... And slows down. Bands of charged particles hit the Earth's electromagnetic field and cause the Northern Lights. At auspicious times they snap like giant cosmic rubber bands. That's the sound. So, the sun's rays make big long strings that, for whatever reason, break and make a huge sound? Yeah, so something happens on these points when the 'Sound' hits. And it says here that on those spots, unless you're near the center of this web, you can be transported somewhere else and you can play, Snakes... And ladders. So, it's like a web, or the points on a compass. But you never really know where you go. And that's where Charlie might've gone. Maybe. This is a Timetable. Once we get to here that sequence will start with a 'Sound'. And it looks like it won't be long after that until this is. Over. Yeah. When it starts, it will repeat itself 12 times, every five minutes or so. The timing's unpredictable. The accounts I've read of this are pretty insane. Where are we on the timetable now? Here. I'm sorry, you guys. The number of times I told myself this wasn't real. You're gonna get us out of this and we're gonna find Charlie. Is there anything else you remember about the day your Dad disappeared? After I followed him into the woods, he was yelling my Mom's name. And the 'Sound' hit, really, really loud, and I fell off my bike. And I must've stayed on the ground for a bit. I got up and I ran to where he last was, but there was no one there. But you don't know if you were here in the center. Okay, everybody get ready. Brace yourselves, everyone. Was that it? Does that mean we can go home... What's that!? Too soon! She's gone! Time must be speeding up. Meredith! Meredith! Meredith! Meredith! This isn't happening. Oh! Meredith! Meredith, what happened? Tell me what you saw? Oh! Charlie! My Dad was right. No, my Dad was right! Sorry, I'm so sorry! Please! Guys, over here! - Okay. - What in the hell's... Okay, everybody calm down, just breathe. What the hell was it shooting at? Just shut up! All right, everyone in one piece? Nobody's been hit? No, I think we're all good. That was incredible, that was whole other world. It's real, with us in it, can you believe it? We literally - just tried to kill ourselves. - I can't believe what just happened, did it? - That was amazing. - Why would we try to kill ourselves? And why would they... That was real, we have to do it again, we've got to do it again. Do it again, are you crazy!? They had a whole system set up with symbols on trees just like ours. And you wanna go back there? No... somewhere else. There're three other choices. There have to be other dimensions that have us in them too. They probably have webs set up all over too, and we could travel all over if we wanted to. You're crazy. I bet all of these places have versions of us. And in this case they wanna shoot us. And the place I went to, I landed on that backward seven thing and there was something huge following me and no people. I ran to the only symbol I recognized. It was a figure 8, infinity sign that was just there somehow. Wait, the infinity, how did you know to try it? That was my only option, I just guessed. So now, we know what our symbol is. We can do it. Come on, there are other versions of us in other worlds, doing different versions of what we're doing here, right? Other 'Sams', other 'Paulas'. And that just might wanna kill us. We stay here in the center! We won't go anywhere, and we ride this thing out, simple. Why are you staring at me? Paula, when you fell off your bike, you weren't near the center, right? Okay, so before you continue to freak out, just hear me out. Paula, maybe it wasn't your Dad who disappeared. What? What if - you - disappeared, and you ended up here. Just, think about it. I know it sounds crazy, but it explains everything. You came here to this dimension, or whatever you wanna call it. Does that make any sense? There's something you don't know, Sam. Before my Dad disappeared, there was no such thing as The Hide and Seek Tree. I've never been able to explain it. I just thought that I didn't remember it right. Because it wasn't the same woods. Then what about your Dad from this place, what happened to him? And what happened to Paula from here, where is she? Who knows, they could've disappeared to some other place at the same time, I mean, I know it's wild but it explains everything. You came here, and Dad and Paula from here went somewhere else, and you still had his Notebook. Nearly identical to the one that I got from DARPA that I know belonged to your Dad in this world. Two real books. Two different worlds. You guys. Weren't really your friends. I don't belong here. I can't, I can't believe this. Just take it easy. Wait. By my count, there are 3 'Sound' events left. Which means, we can send you back. What? One of the points on the compass has to be where you came from. Okay, can we just go over this again. The center is where we stood when we came back from Omega. And, the backwards 7 is where I went. And I'm taking Alpha, or the Eye of Horus next. That's insane. This is real, and I'm gonna go somewhere and bring back something as proof, and you'll all be my witnesses. Bring back what? Me, or another version of me or one of you, with knowledge of a completely different world. This is worth a fortune. Except for the part where you die. I have a 50/50 chance. I'll come back with enough time left for you to repeat the process and make your way home. If wherever I go doesn't have a Hide and Seek Tree, then we know that that's your home. If not, then we know that the other choice most likely is. You sure about this? It's my party. Look, I'm just trying to get back to my place, my world. No, no, no, no, please, please. Please. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, please. Please. No, please, please, please, please, please, please. No, no, no, no, no! Mysterious Horn Sound. Oh no... You should go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What's your name? What's your name? Paula, it's Paula, I'm your daughter! I have your Notebooks. It's her, it worked. She found her way back. There's someone here who's been trying to meet you for quite awhile. Your Mother will be very happy to see you. Wait. There! The girls from Omega have used the 'Sound' to cross over. Prime the weapon. Move towards me as quick as you can. Move, now. Now! RUN! Baker to dispatch, Baker to dispatch, come in, over. Sheriff, this is dispatch. It's great to hear your voice. It's been a Hell of a day here. Someone walked in who looked just like you, said she was you and started talking about triangles and portals, and - do you have a Twin we don't know about? Over. Sheriff? Breaking news from Mount Shasta, California. One person is dead and two are missing following weeks of bizarre activity in the area. Shasta's no stranger to unexplained incidents. Over the years, numerous residents have vanished, livestock have disappeared, and people around here are hearing a loud, ominous 'Sound'. Some people are even claiming to see a strange young woman wearing what one local farmer described as a glowing shroud. That farmer is with me now. Sir, can you tell me what you saw? I was pickin' apples in the yard, and that 'Sound' happened again. It's been happenin' a lot lately. And then this woman showed up out of nowhere. I thought maybe she was lost or somethin'. I said, "Hello," and she started to flicker, kinda 'glow'. What happened next? I've seen that kind of thing before so I got the Hell outta there. That 'Sound' always comes just before the weird stuff. It was the same thing 20-some-odd years ago. When those people, they went missin', and those other people just showed up outta nowhere. All kinds of government experts and such, they came out here pokin' around, they couldn't figure it out either. They all said I was nuts. Now someone's dead. People around here want answers and they want 'em right now. Well judging by the number of incidents in the Shasta area lately, it doesn't look like we'll have any answers any time soon.
