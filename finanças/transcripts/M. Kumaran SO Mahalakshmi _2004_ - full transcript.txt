This is a statue Shaik Fakurudeen has ordered it for 5,000 dollars He is on his way with cheque to take delivery Go man Oh goodness! It has broken into three pieces Come Shaik As required by you the statue is ready We toiled for 15 days until the chisel became blunt If you keep this before your palace in Malaka No dog will enter your place - What do you mean? I meant nobody will dare to enter People would be spellbound looking at the statue Look, if the statue doesn't come the way I want... I know, persons behind me will shoot me at my back If you look at it light you will be taken aback Why are you standing like a statue in front of the statue? Go that side This will be a prototype for beauty - See it - Let me see I said prototype but the front appears different Don't mistake me Because it was chiseled in haste it has come out like this You don't say anything Come here Give me your hand What a creative work? So beautiful I have gone abroad and have a huge collection at my palace But, I have never seen like this The specialty is that the entire beauty is in the front You stand out there Give me your hand This is not a mere hand, but is a chisel But I won't pay you 5,000 Dollars Please... - No I will pay you 50,000 Dollars Give him a cheque for 50,000 Dollars Why is he using abusive language? I planned to keep it my lawn Now it will be kept in my bedroom Bye! - It will be an orgy in midnight hereafter Alas! You have lost a customer I had changed the part and spoiled your business No, you have lifted my sagging business What do you say? Because of you now I am going to earn 50,000 Dollars Is it so? - All that I manufacture here you change as you like So you are staying with me What is that you need now? Your wife - What? - I need a cup of coffee Come down Come Why are you always angry with me? Is it because I left your mother alone? Did she tell you that I tortured her? Never, she cannot hate me That's why she had sent you to me She has understood my love When my mother was alive, she never spoke bad about you She never allowed even me to comment about you Tell that To that extent she loved you But you don't deserve it What do you know about it? I loved my Laklshmi equivalent to my Kick Boxing, do you know? Take rest tonight Tomorrow after warming up will go for the match You are going win certainly you are this year's champion This is a big opportunity for me I will never miss it Lakshmi Sir, Kumaran not well, Madam has taken him to hospital What happened? Kumaran is laid up with fever, he is in the ICU I am afraid - Don't worry, nothing will happen Went to your house heard that your son is sick How is he now? It was severe during night now it is better So, you did not sleep whole night How will you participate in the match? I am all right, I will participate Winning is important, look how tired you are I will certainly win How will you win? I have invested lakhs for you I you lose, what will happen to my reputation? Please don't make this a big issue He is prepared to come with you Please go with them, I will take care - OK, come on Take off the gloves and wear bangles you are fit only for that You should have died when you were defeated You should have died I have never seen you like this I am afraid, why do you... I have lost because of this The love you have on me the affection I have on my son... ...all these trivial things made me lose Sit down I cannot live, with an ideal to be a good hubby and a good father My ideal is to become a champion An austerity Wrong, Person like me should not have married The day I married you I had the first defeat When I had a child It was my second defeat I am scared, I will lose forever like this Not that I don't have affection for you or Kumaran Leave me alone for sometime I must win the championship Until then I don't want anything For a short while let us part Till yesterday we loved truly Hereafter that love will disintegrate Further let us not witness it together Let us not denigrate love Whenever you won, I was happy I had so much love for you If that is going to be a barrier for your success I don't want If winning is your ambition I too have an ambition However hard I toil I must bring up my son If you can manage without me and our son for sometime Thereafter destiny will decide our life That destiny never allowed me to meet her till the end But I didn't leave it I did win To forget that one defeat I won consecutively 1,2,3,... 6 times Look there All this is OK How did you get the step-mother? That was an obligation After my defeat no one took notice of me Then Shalini's father sponsored me and trained me So what, did he sponsor his daughter too? Don't argue with me, try to understand me He requested me and... I did not know about Lakshmi's whereabouts So I married her Don't look at me like that I am not a merciless man I know about my Lakshmi She is clever, she can manage on her own I know she can bring up her child responsibly So I was peaceful here is it So, husbands of all working women can desert their wives Since I took a decision then Now, in Malaysia at International level I am champion Don't always clamor you are a champion What kind of a champion are you? What have you done? 6 times you have defeated visible opponents Is it a big thing? But, my mother has been... ...battling 1000 invisible opponents and have won She is the real champion in life You are nobody before... Don't say you are good under influence of liquor We are not so gullible to believe you If anything is left out drink and go to sleep. Now let me go What is he saying? Please listen to me Only fools will listen to you Please have it Don't feel sorry, I did it purposely These fellows come only for dashing Idiots - Yes, yes This is the girl whom I dashed, how is she? Very nice No don't do Room No. 105, come to my room - Don't do, listen to me Malayalee Girl! We are also from India Why have you stopped? I think it is OK Come close now Why are you staring at us? Are you a hero? - Me? No we are just eating Because I am handsome she is standing next to me on her own You mind your business - They say, they will take me with them Who are you? - Me? Don't kid, will you not save me? Am I mad to fight with them to save you? You are not mad, I am mad after you I have come to Malaysia only to see you Is it enough? - Come on say it again What is that you are talking to yourself? It is personal matter, please don't disturb You tell me - Kumara, I love you. Say that in Tamil Nadu style Kumara, I love you Mind your business After a long gap they are together What do we do then? - Have some beer in the bar and then piss off What do you think of us? Assault them You are a hindrance to the fight Please stay here I will finish and come If girls are alone will you call them to your room? Don't hit me, it is paining Go Where are you dragging me? Let me tell you, follow me How long you made me wander? At last I made you to say Will you admit now, that I win Tell me No, Neither You nor Me It is your mother who has won My mother! Do you know her? Yes, I know her very well The day after the semi-final match got over She met me Kumaran is no one else, is my son Is it true aunty? - Yes I knew, you liked him very much He too loves you dearly I heard you are leaving tomorrow I don't know, Whether he would express his love or not Let me say All his wishes must end up in happiness That is my only wish Now he is in love with you Even if I am not here, you must be with him Why do you say like this aunty? I have some heart problem I don't know, what will happen, when? I expect you to be with him always in life Will you give that assurance to me? You have a great mom It is good that I spoke to her for 10 minutes Else, I would have missed a lot I like you very much But I was not aware about your wish After talking to your mother I have decided you are everything for me Soon, I got permission from my parents Are you glad? I wanted to share this earlier But you were teasing me all along I too wanted to tease you Is it? - Yes At times when I fooled you I had a hearty laugh It is alright But you and mother, misunderstood one thing So far I tried to understand whether you in love with me or not? Nothing more than that, I did not love you What do you mean? Yes, if I had thought so I would have expressed it to you straight Did I ever say, I love you? Tell me, did I tell you? Is it not? Somehow, I wanted to know if you are in love with me I have found out that is all But you have started talking about love and all... I was kidding I said it for fun Sorry, I just lied I said sorry Is it Tamil Nadu style? - Malaysian style How is that? Shall I keep you on my waist? This green parrot is crazy about me Should I hold you on a noose? Lift me and hug me in your river I am the king of eighteen villages Won't this rose bloom on my touch? I am the queen of eighteen villages You take me somewhere Won't touch you unless I am athirst Won't leave unless I relish you Won't give instantly Won't leave you too You punch it hard - Shut your mouth Shall I keep you on my waist? This green parrot is crazy about me Should I hold you on a noose? Lift me and hug me in your river You are a three-river I am a four-river Hunger makes me mischievous Became a seven-river... When your fingers ascended me... Your heat melted my bod O Parrot! You shy in vain Cat has reached the pot O boy!

Don't try to control me with imaginary relationship My family and your family are different I am in love with Anand I will roam with him, anywhere Not only roaming, I will do whatever I like Who is he to slap our daughter? What connection does he have with this family? For the past 4 years, Anand is a family friend She used to inform me whenever she goes to discotheque with him It is common to go to discotheque in Malaysia He has come from Tamil Nadu and is behaving like a brute Have we ever hit her? Then, who is he to hit her? Don't ask that repeatedly He is my son He was born to me before our marriage Who are you to hit Swapna? What way you are related to her? Are you my father?
