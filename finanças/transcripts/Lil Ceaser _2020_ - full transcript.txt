I like to tell you a fable, a fable of post traumatic stress disorder. - Hey Mrs. Braden, how are you? - Oh, Timmy, I am great, just going through some paper work. How was work today? - Work was good. - Everything okay at the barber shop? - Everything is good, just tired a little bit and hungry. - I figured you'd say that, come on in here so I can get you something to eat. Destiny, come in here and fix Timmy a plate. I'm coming. You been fast asleep? What's wrong with your face? - Boy hush. - You two crack me up, sometimes I think you're actual siblings. Timmy, did you ever go get that ID? 'Cause you're gonna work for that temporary service, you know you're going to need it. - No Mrs. Braden, besides I've been working with Poppa Benny, increase the good over there. And he pays every day. So it's better than where you're working a week or two. - I don't know why? All you're gonna do is give it to Earl, I'm here, just don't understand why you let that man walk over you like that. - Earl is my uncle, and I love him. And I know he acts voguer sometimes, but he's all I got, that's my family. - Timmy, we're your family too, okay? - Timmy, remind me so much of your mother, she was always all about family. I just can't help it to wonder whatever happened to Teresa. Okay, so this is the infamous Dream Stylez barber shop. Owned by Poppa Benny and this is the man himself, Poppa Benny.

How is the ride down here? - It was good. - Man, I was riding down the road, Pony gave him a couple. - Okay baby, so Timmy, how you been? - I'm good. Every now and then, Poppa Benny would take Timmy out to lunch, kick it with him, spend some time with the little barber. And his wife Leslie, she was fine by Timmy too. It was almost like an outing on a family structure. That was something Timmy needed. Poppa Benny supplied that for him, he was more like his nest. He knows he felt secure in there. He loved him. - Slim, Slim, Slim. What's going on Slim? I got a favor to talk about here with you. Back in the days when I was a baller, trying to come up, I went to one of my guys, to buy a couple of them things, I asked him the price and he told me the price, I said, damn, can you cut it a little bit? 'Cause we homies, he said, yeah we friends, but this is a business. You understand? This is a business, and he couldn't do that for me. So later on at night, me and my friends, we went up to his room. He was knocked the fuck out. Girl must have put the pussy on him. She must've had the bomb. I woke him up. I asked him where the work at. He said, I ain't telling you shit. I said, wait a minute, man, where they're work at? Again, he said, I ain't telling you shit. So I tell Pony, I say Pony, give him some. Pony hit that nigga square across the bridge of his nose and broke it, and you know what? He still didn't tell me where the work was. I said, I'm gonna take my time with him. Juju, go get me an iron and you fill that motherfucker up with water and you make sure it's steaming, and A.B and Pony, y'all flipped that motherfucker over. And you know what I did, I dropped that arrogant square on his motherfucking ass. And you know that motherfucker screamed? You know he screamed? But you know what? He told me where the work was. Just like you gonna tell me where Poppa Benny gonna be. - Reporting to you live from WBLS Channel six news, today marks a very somber event, as it is that we're here to attend the funeral of cartel Slim Robinson.

I ran that street like I had a lot of money. The only thing I'm gonna say is, that was your father, he brought me in, he loved me, just like I love you, you're family. - Let me ask you this question, uncle Earl, before he died he said my mum was a crack head, is that true? - Hey Timmy, bad things happen to good people. When you're in the world of drugs, sometimes things happen. But I can tell you one thing, she loved you. Do you understand? - If she loved me, then why'd she leave me? - I can't explain this son.

Girl, bring it here - Tell Timmy goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight little ones - All right, work for the day. Here's some numbers, packages that we received the other days, the numbers are looking good. - Well, well, well, tell Smiley to keep up the good work. - Most definitely, now the Willie Black thing that you took over his territory, straight to the roof, excellent. Take a look at it. - Look, do we need to change anything? - I'm thinking, if it's working out, I don't want us to really kind of tip it over or whatever. Let's just stick to the plan. - It'll work. - Okay, now we have one problem, the West side, Gloria's numbers are low, reason being Burgess, Burgess's expecting an envelope from her every week. And it shows in her paperwork, take a look, you tell me what you think. Should I pay her a visit? - Yes, pay Glow a visit. And I wanna together bring the rest of the family and see how we can put up a solution to this Burgess. - No problem, I'll show down to Glow, and I'll inform her about the meeting, and set a date and time. She'll call me and I'll go see her. In the meantime, these are the rest of the numbers, I need you to go over everything, all right? - Good. - I made it worse. - Was that Littles that just left? - Yes, he went out to the West. - So how the family business going on? - Some of it is good, but we have a problem, we have to deal with Burgess. He's cutting in to Glow's money, in that white envelope and that hurts the business, but I asked Littles and Esquire to handle it. But we need to get the family together to get the solution. - So, how sooner is this? When are we gonna get this started? - Immediately. - Immediately? - We must get this done. - Okay, I understand, I'll make some calls. - What's the problem? - Problem? - What is the problem? - The problem? - That's what I thought. - The problem, okay. Okay. The problem. Don La Bianca, the man of peace, the man who trained Cloth, he asked Timmy to come to Chinatown, have a sit down with him, so he could try one last ditch effort to bring in peace between this Doc Mays and Timmy Gibbs stance. - Hey Timmy, how you doing? Glad you guys came, make yourself comfortable Punch. You're welcome to join us here and my guys here in Chinatown, like the home, okay, please, be comfortable. Timmy, thank you very much for coming to Chinatown to see us, really, I'm very happy to see you. - What is this about? - Listen, there's been a lot of action on the streets. We don't know what's going on, but it's not running smoothly. - We have a situation with Doc Mays. - We gotta do something about it. We gotta fix it, everyone's got to eat. - No disrespect, but this is not about money. This is about my loyalty, my respect and my - I understand, and I'm a man and you're a man. So I respect that. But at the same time, we got a lot of people out there and it gotta be protected, we got a big pipeline, it's gotta keep flowing. So something's gotta be done, I think. - Doc Mays has been out of hand, and I need to handle this my way. - I understand Timmy, I understand where you're coming from. I'd like to see some peace, I'd like to see things settle down, but I respect what you're saying. - You not going through what I'm going through right now. But I wanna put a stop to this situation, myself. I understand Thank you for coming, and when I sit here, God bless you. - Thank you. Hey Sylvia. - What the fuck is you doing here? Slim's keys. Is she breathing? Clean that shit up man, all right. - Heading over to the Pool Hall right now, had enough of this shit, I'll tell you that right now.
