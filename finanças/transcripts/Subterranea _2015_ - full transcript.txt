What are you doing down here all by yourself? Thinking. About what? That I waited too long. Too long? It'll be 25 years to the day tomorrow. I'm fearful he's grown too dependent. Too acclimatized. I don't know if he'd make it. I've made him too weak. This has been the plan from the very beginning. We can't just abandon our work now. It all rests on what happens next, all of it. We're so close to finding the answer. I'm not sure he's ready. I'm not sure I'm ready. Listen to me, I will take care of him, I'll watch him, you have my word. It's time for you to let go. Trust me, he's ready. Are you awake? Who is he? I don't know. Hello. Who are you? Maya. Maya. Where am I? You first, I want a straight answer out of you. Who are you? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. All I remember is darkness. What do you mean? There was this small room. I was alone. That's all there was. That's it? No, no, there was a light. A voice taught me to speak and to read. A voice? A provider. - A. - A. - B. - B. - C. - C. And he led him into a cave below the earth. And he led him to a cave below the earth. There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows. There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows. So how'd you get out? I don't know, I woke up in chaos. The light, the sound. It overwhelmed me. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to go. I was afraid. Until Remy found me. Remy? Hey, hey, what can I do for ya? Panic? Come here. You're freezing to death. You all right? You okay? Yeah, you're okay. Come on, we better get out of here before she calls the cops, she's freaked out. Hey, you speak English or what? You got a broken leg? Let's go, come on. English, come on. He was the first person that I met. He took care of me. He taught me. I told him about my life, about the darkness. I told him everything. Crazy shit. That must've been in some rich folks jail. What is that? Fancy prison. You must've pulled off some job. What'd you do, huh? Nothing. You want me to believe that, huh? Like you're some kind of fucking Rip Van Winkle? What is fucking Rip Van Winkle? You're all right. A little fucking strange, but you're all right. What's a fucking Rip Van Winkle. It's a story. It's about a man who falls asleep for a long time and wakes up in a new world. I understand. I need to find him. Who? The provider, he's the only one who knows who I am. Maybe I can help. How can I trust you? Fire. Lesson number one, there's only one person that you can count on in this life and that's yourself. You gotta watch your back, don't trust anyone, no one, 'cause they'll always let you down. You hear me? Yes. All right, go ahead. Hey, hey. What are you having? What are we having? We'd like two danish. Okay, anything else? Yeah. How are you doin' today, everything good? Yeah, everything's good. Nice earrings, I like those. Thank you, coffee? Two coffees. Scumbag. It's like that, huh? No respect in service these days. Listen. Lesson number two. Take what you want. If you see it, take it. See it, take it. Yeah. - The money. - What? Take it. That's what I'm talking about. Coffee ready? His results are like nothing I've ever seen. There's no records of anything. What do you mean? It means that on a PC level, he doesn't exist. Nothing? Well, there's no medical or dental records, no birth certificate, fingerprints, social security, nothing. It's almost as if somebody wiped him off the face of the Earth. Either that or... Or what? Or he never had any. But everybody's got records, at least something. I was able to find the name of his mother. She had blood work done about the same time he was born. Her last known address is in there. Look, I've done what I promised. I'm done, you should do the same. He's trouble, Maya, I don't care what you see. I need to know who he is. Maya. I love you but this is insane. You don't know who he is, what he's capable of. Take it, put one in him, come on, do it! Shoot the fucker! I won't let you do this, I'm calling the police. No, stop. What if he can give me some answers? You already know you can go if you want answers. No, I want the truth, no more lies. Look, just give me some time. If I don't find anything out, I'll make the call myself. Promise me you will. What did she mean I don't exist? What did she mean by that? You weren't suppposed to hear that. We'll start looking in the morning. To exist signifies to be or to have life. Immortal souls will never cease to exist. That's all for today, now, go to sleep. Are you inside or am I? Well this is it. Your mother's last known address. Is that her? Why don't you let me go check this out first. Where is she? She's down there. What's she doing down there? She's dead. She's buried here. Oh. I never really had a mother either. I remember things about her, but nothing concrete, nothing real. Guess it kind of makes us the same. How? We're both orphans. But I had a father of sorts. Where is he? I don't know, I haven't seen him in awhile. Don't you want to? Come on, let's go. Who's this? It's me. What do you mean? I mean that was taken when I was a child. It was a long time ago. This is you? Yeah. It's kind of hard to see the resemblance, huh? I guess I've always liked flowers. At least as long as I can remember. What's it like? What? Never having seen this before. At first I was... Angry. Then I was ashamed. I had never actually known what a star looked like before tonight. I read the word hundreds of times. A fixed luminous point in the night sky, that is a large, remote, incandescent body like the sun. I just... Didn't know it would be so beautiful. It feels good. Are you sure he's asleep? Yes, we put him down hours ago. Listen. I wanna take him out. Out? We can't go on with this, it's not right, it's not human. I don't think we can do that. You trust me, don't you? Of course I trust you. Then let's end this madness. Can you spare any, can you spare any change? Hey buddy, you got an extra buck? Come on, I'm hungry. Hey, you got nothin'? Hey, you guys got any extra coins? I'm just trying to get home, I gotta get the bus. Get a job, man. Son of a bitch. Wait until you need something, huh. Wait until you need an extra buck. Hey, you got an extra dollar on ya? Hey, hey, good lookin'. Hey, little girl! Little girl! Bitch. Hey, buddy, you got any extra, extra, just trying to get something to eat, I'm hungry. Come on, you got something. You're all right, thank you, God bless you, man. That's how you do it. That's how you get these people. How'd you make out? All right, it's a start. It's a start, all right, good work, come on. Pervert. That's one way to pick up someone. We'll have to work on that though. Now you're learning. That a boy. Come on. Hey, hand it over. That's right. I got a bigger job lined up for you. This is small potatoes. Assault that occurred last week downtown. Police now releasing this photograph of the suspect that they've obtained from an anonymous source. The victim Manuela Bloc is still in critical condition. Police are asking anyone with information to contact Crime Enders. Speaking out on the recent rash of violence is Dr. Peter Mockenrue, he joins us now with his thoughts. As preconditioned as we are to these types, senseless acts, it's always jarring when it arrives in our community and it touches us personally. That's him. I think we can all agree it's very sad. Violence continues to be... I can't tell you what you don't already know. I reign the horse for those who cannot see. It's the provider, he's here. That's the voice. Stop it, stop it. My provider's here. Hey, hey, put your head down. You know that guy, huh? I don't... I think we're being followed. Okay. Yeah, take these. We need to lay low for awhile. Put that on. Remy thought he was a cop, he was always watching. So Remy came up with a plan. He caught him. Paul Grant. What if he wasn't following Remy? What do you mean? Maybe he can help. Just act natural. Just act natural. Can I help you? We were just wondering if you were happy with your internet connection, Mrs. Grant. My name's not Grant. We must've gotten our information wrong. Sorry for the inconvenience, Miss... What are you doing? Be quiet, I'm trying to find out who she is. The address is correct, but, but there's nothing on Paul Grant. Come on, Lucas. I'm doctor. Let's clean this up then. Can I help you? I'm just looking for someone. I see, well you've come to the right place. Just let me know if I can help you with anything else. What are you doing? What is this place? It's a church. And who is he? That's Jesus. Jesus. What's wrong with him? I'll tell you later, we have to go. Come on, let's go, come on. Come on, down here. Go. Stay here, I'll be right back. Hey, where are you going? Hey! He's here. I'm sure that he didn't see you, I'm going to go upstairs to make sure he's gone, all right? This is getting serious. He's being chased by the police. People are dead. When was the last time you had a gun in your face, Lucas? We need to end this and we need to end it now. We can't. Peter said that under no circumstances are we to interfere. He has already seen my face. We need to lay low. We already interfered enough. Come on, Lucas, lift with your legs. If we don't end this now, someone is going to die. No one's going to die. How do you know that? He's not Maya. Maya. Yeah, I don't know how he found her, but she's all tied up with him now. I couldn't tell Sarah, I'm sure you'll understand. But I'm gonna tell Peter. No, we're going to relax and stay calm. I'm calm. The only thing we're going to tell Peter is that everything is going according to the plan. You're out of your pay grade. Go out there. I hope it's the kid. Christ. Can you please just tell me what's going on? Talk to me. I don't know. The priest's name is Lucas Dietrich. He started the fail safe initiative at the church, whatever that is. I've seen him before, both of them. They were carrying me somewhere. That looks fresh. Don't touch it. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to help. How do they know you? What? Those men, they mentioned your name, how do they know you? They mentioned my name? I don't know. Believe me. Fine. I come here when I wanna think. It's strange though, there's something about this place that haunts me. I dream about being here, finding something. I see these images in my mind playing over and over, they seem so real. I come here when I wake looking but I every time I do, I feel farther away. But I keep coming back. I always come back. Why? It's just not that easy to forget your past, you know? At least you have one. Something to remember. Anything. I'm sorry. Maya, how'd you find me? I said I got your money, man. I was there. I was taking the trash out at work when I heard fighting in the alley. Shit. Take it. I saw what happened. Put one in him, come on, shoot the fucker! I saw what he did to you. Do it. I couldn't do it. I know. Pussy, afraid to get your hands dirty? Come on! Shit. Fuck with me? No. What do you mean no, huh? That's not how it works here. You are an accomplice to a murder, understand? We just killed these guys. I didn't. Who's to say that you didn't? You're a ghost, right? You're in it for the ride, kid. I don't want your help anymore. Yeah? Sorry about that kid. Better luck next time. No amount of money's worth that shit. He set you up and left you for dead. I couldn't just leave you out there, so I brought you to my house. Despite of what everyone told me, or what the news said. There's nobody here. It's just you and me. Blue bell. You owe me one. Why? I saved you. I wanna show you somewhere else I think you'll like. There's so much. So much what? Everything. I spent there this whole time I had no idea. I just feel stupid. You're not. Believe me. You're brighter than most. Why are you doing this? Doing what? Helping me. I don't know. You might think I'm crazy, but... I know your eyes. I've seen them before. I don't think you're crazy. Just relax. I love you. How do you know blue bell? What? I heard you talking in your sleep. You kept repeating the word blue bell. Oh. I don't know. It's a flower. Who's this? It's me, kind of hard to see the resemblance, huh? Maya? Hello? Maya? Hello? Are you there? Hello? You need to leave now. Who is this? There's no time for that. He's coming for you. You need to go. What? What are you waiting for? I'm trying to find Maya. If you want answers, meet me at Cross Street. Maya. Maya! Hey, what can I get ya? Just a decaf latte. Cool. There you go. How much do I owe ya? It's 3.85. There you go. - There you go. - Thanks. Hey. What do you think you're doing? Hey, hey, man, let go. Let go, please, let go. Give me your hands. No, no. Put your hands behind your back now. Maya! Stop resisting me, give me your hands, right now. Give me your hand. We were supposed to go away together and now she's gone, can you help me? Turn to your right. What, where? I said turn. Face front. Where am I? Home. Now go to sleep. Damn it. Sorry. Hey, it was an accident. I had no control, you know? Come on, we gotta get out of here! Get up, hey, I said let's go, come on. He's watching you. His eyes are everywhere. Hello? You can't escape it. You can't hide in the light. There's no where to hide. Hello? Provider? No, we don't get out. We're all kind of stuck here. We don't ever get out. Rise and shine. Your bail's been paid, you're free to go. Do you want to leave or not? Get up. Here, he gave you this. Hello? Over here. Who are you? The name's Andrew, climb aboard. Come on. I'm not gonna bite ya. Okay. Going down. Welcome to my extremely humble abode. Sorry about the mess, it's the maid's year off. You think I should let her go? Ah, there it is. It's beautiful. The mark. Gees. I forgot how jumpy I was at first. Hey. Let's relax. What do you want from me? I want to help you. I want to help us. Come over here and look at this. Come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Look familiar, huh? Ah. You see now. Who are you? I'm your brother. I escaped a long time ago from the same fate you suffered. I spent my whole life searching for answers. Everything, all of this, is a collection of evidence and clues. He's eluded me all this time. But now you've come. We can find him now and make him pay. Who? The provider. How can I trust you? He seized him so firmly with his ice cold hand that he could not resist and he led him into a cave below the earth. There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows. Some large, others half sized, others small. Every moment, some were extinguished and others burnt up again so that the flames seemed to leap upward, hither and thither in perpetual change. How do you know that? Because he read me the same bed time stories. The same lies and deceptions he fed you. How did you find me? Fairly easily, I've been following you. As you can see, I like to keep an eye on things. I've been watching your story on the news. You've picked up quite the track record. Eventually the police would've locked you up for good if I hadn't bailed you out. They're still looking for me? Of course they are. Then why did they let me go? Well sometimes it pays to be a ghost. I only mean that it's very hard for someone to pin anything on someone with no record, no history. That's the gift of your anonymity. It's covered your tracks well enough. I've taken care of the rest. I'm the only one who can pin anything on you now, or perhaps him. You know him. Paul Grant, of course. He followed me around too for awhile. Never could get my hands on him, slippery bastard. So when he turned up wherever you were, I just put two and two together. I've seen him before too. Ah, yes, Lucas. He's one of his servants. Praying on the innocent souls once they're released. Trying to control our weak and atrophied minds on the outside. You see, you're not the only one. We're not the only ones. There are lots of us out there, just look. Some have no recollection at all and won't believe the truth. Others are just too far gone and have lost the sense and sanity. You see, we're all part of his sick game. But together, we can get answers. Maya. I'm sorry, I saw what happened. What, what happened? He took her. Who? The provider. If you want to find her, you're going to have to find him. To kill him. For everyone he hurted and contained, for every life he said was too sensitive to fly on its own, for you who had everything denied and taken from you. Don't you want to know why? An end to all the silence? Well close the door then. What are we looking for? Evidence. She's involved in this, we need to find out how. Looks like she had some company. Take a look. I'll check the back. Hey, look at this. Well time's up. I've seen this before. Well, take the picture, it'll last longer. Well let's see, the kitchen appears to be closed for the night. I don't suppose you don't want any of this, but I do. Hey, look what I found in there. I need to go back to Maya's. Okay, let's go. No. I need to be alone. Completely. Hello? Bluebell, Bluebell. I trust you. That's good. Let's leave. What about your answers? I don't need them. All I need is you. We'll go in the morning. Don't leave. I won't. I promise. Hey. Hey. Remy. Are you insane, huh? What do you think you're doing? You just can stand around at the scene of a crime with your thumb up your ass. You could've gotten me caught. Okay. What do you mean okay? It's not okay, sit down! I'm in too deep right now, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You got a lot to learn. You're not worth my time. Then teach me. It's about time. Easy on the jacket. Take it easy. Think for a second. Hey, hey, what are you gonna do to me? I want answers. Keep walking. Let me go. You're not going anywhere, not until I get answers. I don't got any answers for you, kid. Sit down. - Now, come on... - Sit down! All right. I am sitting down. Now I wanna know what you've done with her. Maya, where is she? See the problem with you is you don't even know what you want. I mean how could you? You don't even know your name. Come on, let's stop... Who did this to me? Who did this to me? Why am I like this? He's Mockenrue. Mockenrue. Mockenrue. Get off him. You almost fucking killed him, you idiot. He's got answers that we need. He said Mockenrue. What? Mockenrue, I've heard that name before. What are you fucking talking about? You let him be. Damn it. What have you done? You're supposed to help the kid, not kill him. He just screwed the whole thing up. He tried to kill me. What? I told you, Andrew was gonna get someone killed. Enough is enough, check it. Is he dead? No, he's still breathing. Okay. I think it's time now, we need to end this. Let's get him to the train. It's about bloody time, Reverend. Let's go. The next stop is Seven Sisters. Next stop, Seven Sisters. You made it. I knew you would. I always said you were bright. Provider. I am. Let's have a look at you. And whom I am well pleased. I bet you'd like some answers. Would you like to sit? Do you mind if I sit? No? Okay. Where to begin? I am a problem solver, I've been one my whole life and I'm very good at it if I don't say so myself. I've lost so much, so many people that I've loved and cared for to hate and violence. I had a daughter years ago. Elle. She was my light. It was a week before the police found her. It ruined me. I saw the problem like many people have down through the history and I saw it getting worse and worse with no end in sight. So I decided that there must be another way. We've done so much else to solve problems that are plaguing our planet. Environmental collapse and disease and famine and what do we do? We look to science to shed light on cures, possible solutions to avoid catastrophe, yes? We've even gone so far as to set up institutions all around the globe to study the idea of violence and analyze what it is, but you see, I grew impatient. I wasn't satisfied with mere academic acknowledgement. I wanted something done. I wanted action. See. Peace has remained an unobtainable phenomenon. Not to sound simple minded about it, but it's something that's alluded us since the dawn of time. Peace never existed. It was always something that we've continually fantasized and evangelized, it was always out of reach. A hope that one day, we could take a hold of it. But I got tired of hoping. I lost my hope a long time ago. 'Til you came. You're my hope, my attempt at a solution. An attempt at peace if you will to see if it truly is out of our reach, whether nature denies us this right all together. You. How could you do this to me? I never had a chance. A chance at what? You don't see. No, I don't see. I never saw anything because of you. I took a chance, I saw the path you could've taken, I lived it firsthand myself. I saved you from all the sleepless nights and the gnawing emptiness, that enigmatic pain that consumes our species, I wanted to give you something more. Your mother died in childbirth. You had no father, no family, no friends, so I adopted you. We tended for you together, Sara and myself. You were our new beginning. A reason for us to go on, a reason for us to exist. Sara. Yes, Sara was my partner. Shh. She loved you like a son. Too much so. She grew too attached, she lost sight of the big picture. She wanted to bring you up. Yes! She couldn't continue on, she had to leave the project, leaving me with everything. So I continued on, but by that time, you were old enough to be left alone. The only thing left remaining was to teach you. You were truly bright, your attention of knowledge was prodigious maybe from lack of stimulation, but you learned at an incredible rate. Faster than anyone I'd ever seen. It's all right here. Notebooks, journals. Two and a half decades of my work. Our work. Look at this. You remember? Maya. She never should've found you. She put all of my work in jeopardy. Bluebell? Bluebell! Sara and I had made a mistake. Maya was our daughter but I couldn't let her influence the project. So I pushed her away and distanced myself. She never understood and after all those years of neglect, she left. Where is she? With her mother now, I'm sure. Learning her whole life was a lie. It's a lot to take in as I'm sure you're finding out. Come on, Lucas. Lift with your legs. Hold it down. What are you doing? Peter didn't say anything about a tattoo. I don't see Peter here, do you? I'm in charge now. Jesus Christ. Your'e a liar. Just another one of the many who saw to it that you made it here in one piece. I've been watching you for a very long time. You trust me, don't you? Of course I trust you, but this isn't your fault, it's his. No, I took part, I agreed to this, but we've gone too far. Can't you see, he's just a child. No, he's an experiment. Was nothing mine? What's mine? Someone else's time? A smile? What's in here. What isn't yours? Everything is yours, you get to keep it all. I don't belong here. I have nothing. For what? For this, everything comes down to what happens now. You're free. Free. To choose, to act, to forgive. You have the chance to renew our hope. Everything depends on what you decide to do now. Remember why you're here, you need to stick to the plan. Don't touch me. Listen to me. You have every right to be mad. Believe me, I understand what you're feeling. You understand how I feel? No, you don't get to say that to me. You said that you were my brother, why did you tell me that? What did he say? You said I needed to kill the Provider. Just calm down, take it easy. I want Maya. We told you, she's gone, it was too much for her. She had a choice, just like you do and she left. I don't believe you. You don't? Did she tell you she was leaving or where she was going? She was taken. Was she? Bluebell? Mom? Sarah told her all about your pitiful existence if you can even call it that. How you eat by on scraps in the dark, damp basement of a sadistic madman. She knows who you are, what you are and she left, just like he left. Why are we here? Because I trusted the wrong people. I was stupid. I had it. I lost it all. Now I got nothin'. That's what happens when you put faith in the wrong people. They take it away from ya. You gotta remember that. It's time to end this. Where is she? I told you, she's gone. What did he say to you? What has he done? He's ruined everything, all my work. Where is she? Bluebell? I don't know, I haven't seen her in a long time. You took her from me. No, no, I... No. You've ruined my life. I tried to help you, I tried to save you. Do you remember the last thing I said to you before I let you out? This is it. An end to all the silence. Sorry. Father. Why have you done this to me? There will be a day when everything changes for you. You'll lose everything you ever loved. Everything you held close, everything you ever believed in. When that time comes, I want you to remember what I tell you now. I have loved you as a son. Know that everything you've been through, everything I never gave you was out of love. You can't understand it now, but you will. The next stop is Seven Sisters. You are everything I've worked for and hope for. And you're all that I have left. It's all come down to one moment and one decision. Please remember this and know that I'm sorry. Are you awake? Go to sleep.
