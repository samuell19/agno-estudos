THE NAMES OF CHRIST BUD I don't really see... I don't see the problem. You want more money? How much? Infinite. No, what I told you: 100,000. Well... I'll see what I can do. But... I can tell you right now; it's almost impossible. - You know that. - Read this... Where do you come from? Very far away. Why did you come here! - We come to see the child. - We come to see you. How did you climb up there? I just did. I held on wherever I could, and I made it up here. But I'm not coming down. We'll bring you down. ...this is about sex, Puritanism... I don't know it was... I'll see what I can do, Albert. I can't guarantee... anything, - As usual. - Obviously. Because... If you can't guarantee something... there's no guarantee. In any case, I can tell you... there's a good chance. But if you'd tell me what you need it for, it would make it easier.. Because the concept of "expenses”... is rather... abstract, isn't it? Everybody has expenses. Is it for filming expenses? No, it's for me. All the more reason. Are you in debt? Do you gamble? It's unheard of, asking for 100,000 Euros just like that. It's never happened to me before. Like this... I mean with a budget and everything, sure. But 100,000 Euros just like that! I don't know, Albert... Did you drive here? No, I caught the tube. If you had your car, we could drive to the bank and get the 100,000 Euros, right? The bank is about to close. Even if we had the car, we wouldn't get there in time... And even if we did... It isn't far. Yeah, sure... but... That's not the way things are done, Albert. You don't turn up at closing time and expect them to give you 100,000 Euros. If the money is in your account, they'll give it to you. - Really? Then you go and try. They don't give it to me just like that. You have to go the branch manager's office, and explain a bit... These are just excuses, aren't they? Excuses! I don't know... They... need a bit of information... Are these excuses? Are you giving me excuses? No, it's true. You know how it works. If I had the cash here, I'd give it to you, but I don't. And I can't get it just like that... Is it very cold up there! Yes, a little bit. Your feet are freezing! Your feet are warm, very warm. When I climbed up the sun was shining brightly. And they got warm. When will you be able to get it? When will you be able to get it? What you're asking me is difficult, Albert. But perhaps... How much can you get? - [ Try as soon as I can. - 50,0007 50,000 Euros. 50,000, Tomorrow afternoon. I'll do my best. I'll try, Albert. I can't promise anything, OK? I can't promise, right? But I'll try. FACE OF GOD Do you know what the movie is about? More or less. They're sort of making it up as they go along. But do you know where we'll get the dough? Or is it me who comes up with the dough... and you're the executive producer? We'll have to come up with the cash... You and I are the producers. We have to do it with those two girls, right? Shit... Oh well. Do we know where we'll be shooting! More or less, I mean... - Basically here, all here. - All here. And apparently.. The day after tomorrow we'll scout for locations, but this is the way he works, he makes it up as he goes along. OK. Will we make money from it...? Or just cover costs? - I hope we do. - Really? That's the whole idea. WAY I think I've resolved the 'money" issue. I'll sell my mother's apartment and we can make the movie. What do you think? Perfect. What else is on your mind? So you think that will be enough? No, but it's enough to start with. Then, when show that we have this money, a bank might agree to be guarantor, or help to finance the film. Or we can always turn to friends. If they see me putting my money into it they might put theirs in too. Some people don't know what to do with their dough. And if we tell them we're making a film... they'll think... that they'll get to meet the actresses and screw them or whatever, and they'll be game for it... They're game for anything. What do you think? SHEPHERD Those guys are troublesome, and on top of that, they're jerks. Roman, the people you've brought me are... useless. You're not convinced. They're idiots. What did you expect? - PhDs? - No, but... one of them can't move, I don't know what's wrong with the other one, the third... Maybe you're tired of working like this. - Are you? - They have glamour. We just have to explain things to them properly. I have no patience. Should we hire someone to explain it to them... or will you do it? I'm explaining things to them, one by one, but... We're just wasting our time. Yes, but... These people don't... This weekend... three of them didn't turn up, they left town. That's unacceptable. Three were away, another one came for a while in the morning, and another came in the afternoon and made us wait half an hour because of something or other. I'm coming up with solutions, I'm suggesting solutions, but it should be you telling me: "We'll do this or that...", but I didn't like your suggestion, that we replace some people. I don't like that idea at all, It just not... Your philosophy. I mean, if it were necessary, sure, but it isn't their fault. They're just the way they are. - It's not their fault. - You don't know... Right. They aren't... They're special, they have their peculiarities, and we obviously see that, you see it, too. I see it, but I don't care, I shouldn't be aware of it. Perhaps we could start working earlier in the mornings. That might be the start of a solution. But I don't think it's the definitive solution. We don't need a definitive solution as long as we keep pulling through... OK, I'll speak to them. This is not the focus of our lives. For us, this is a tool for doing something else. We have to make it work, to a certain extent. To the extent that makes other things work. Beyond that... It's no longer our objective. - Right? - Yes. You've never focused on this, have you? - No. - Well... But you should have been focusing on it, in this case, you should have. I don't understand how you can tum up like this, this total lack of organisation and lack of, sensitivity too. The thing is that this production Is happening on another level, and it's getting out of my hands. You mean at a level that is too high for you to handle? No, but... I trusted these people. I thought they were at this level, but they're a bit disoriented. Disoriented in what sense? In the sense of... Why are they disoriented? Maybe we haven't explained it to them very well. We can go over the same thing a thousand times, and it won't get us anywhere. Just let me tell you... I'll get them all to come tomorrow:. First thing in the morning, I'll get them all together. Why first thing in the morning? Why don't you get them together in the evening, You can do it whenever you want. Why first thing tomorrow morning? - So that there's no more delays. - What? So we can find a solution as soon as possible. So you should say: "We'll all meet tomorrow morning'. MOUNTAIN When are you leaving! I don't want to leave. In November, when it snows. Don't go. This is a fragment that talks about a word, a name that Dali mentioned ina TV interview. He found it very touching, he didn't know about it, until one of his friends Who was 3 Jesuit told him. It's quite an original name, and the explanation behind it is even more unusual: "...50 we continue, adds David, Mountain of Curds', the Latin word means 'cheese, but it also means hunched, and it originally referred to anything that has elements that bulge or swell. This is why cheese and hunch-backed things were designated by this word. And if we combine it with the noun "mountain', as David does here, and use the plural form, as it appears in the original text, it sounds like the words St Augustine read:'mountain of cheeses', or as many people now prefer, 'mountain of the hunch-backed'. Both versions are very appropriate, because the first seems to confirm and specify the fertility of this mountain, with its rich soil ready to produce rich grains, but at the time it is a mountain of cheese or curds, if we give to the cause the name of the effect: amountain of green pastures for cattle, a fruitful mountain that produces bread, and also good pastures for cattle. And, as St Augustine says, bread, and the richness of the mountain that it comes from, feed the Perfect Ones, the milk that curdles into cheese, and the pastures that feed the cattle are the food of those who start virtuously, as St Paul says: When you were children I gave you milk to drink not solid food; and accordingly, the mountain provides sustenance for everybody, for the fully grown by virtue of its richness, and for the newly born through its pastures and milk." What shall we do now? I don't know What shall we do now? Let's go home. I'm sad. Very, very sad. Me too. He was a good person. Yes, he was. I don't feel well. What's happening! I don't know Shall we go? We'll go home soon. I'm hungry. How are his children? I don't know, I hope they're well. - Are you sad? - Very. Angry? Are you angry? No, I'm not angry, but I'm very sad. Why? Because he's dead. I should go and eat. Are you hungry? Yes, a little. FATHER OF THE FUTURE CENTURY What are you going to do now! Make a movie. As an actress? Or a producer! No, Roman is the producer, you know, that thin guy? Which one? The dark-haired one or the other one? Who's the other one? There are a few Romans. Which do you mean? - Roman Bayarri. - Oh, all right. - See..] - I'm still not sure... Sure, that thin guy with aslightly funny face. - Dark-haired. - Right. - Short hair. - Very pale. - OK, I know who he is. - He doesn't speak much. He was the guy who was on that curve... in Lanzarote. .. I don't know exactly where... in that house... He was controlling traffic on the curve, wasn't he? Yes. That's right. Things have gone well for him, and now... he has good contacts and knows how to get cash. Is he doing things? Yes, a lot of things. And you're planning to do something with him now? Yes. I think its like a mystery film... Great. Do you want to be in it too? I don't know You'll have to tell me more. Why not? It depends. If it's difficult, no. But if it's easy, sure. - You could be an extra. - Great, of course! As long as I don't have to talk. Well, you can tell him. - I can tell him if you want. - Yes, you tell him. I rarely see him. But... - Will they pay us...? - Yes! - Sure, it's... - OK, tell him. Sure... Being an extra is actually quite tiring, but who cares? It might be fun. - You're on your feet all day? - It depends. I don't mind. And if they pay me, great. What if they ask you to take off your clothes? That's a different matter. No way. No? Zero? - I'd wear a bikini, but... - You'd wear a bikini... If we're at the beach. But that's it. I think the film will have some of that in ... Well, we'll see. You can ask them If you can wear clothes... Yes. Will it be in winter or summer? I don't know, it's a period film, but I don't know. I don't know the season... So in theory you're in. Then we'll see... - OK? - Sure! - You can always say no. - What will you do? I don't know, he told me there's a role... - ...of a girl in a bar, I think. - Right, as an actress. She speaks a little bit, but not very much. Maybe she's a waitress in a tavern. But what kind of period movie? In what year is it set? 1900, or... Somebody mentioned that you're making art now. What's that about? I've been asked to make an installation for up-and-coming young people. I'm supposed to use unusual materials. I'll make a pile of sunflower seeds, or something like that... Anything... So you can do anything you like? Yes. Yes. What will it mean? I don't know, whatever people decide it means to them. Haven't you thought about it yet? Sure, I mean... How.. It's come undone. You'll use edible sunflower seeds? Yes, sunflower seed shells. I don't know You don't like it? - Sure, why not? - Abig pile of sunflower seeds. - Eaten? just the shells? - Yes, the shells. As if to say that... So if you eat sunflower seeds, give me the shells!. As a way of criticising the dirtiness of the streets? Sure, if you like. If that pleases you. Dedicated to boredom. - I don't know if I like it. - Sunflower seeds are beautiful. - Once it's done, I'll let you know. - Sure. Man, I stink. I hadn't noticed. I can't smell anything from here. Remember that place we went to...? That girl had such beautiful pears! Yes, but it's the typical surgery, where you can't really be sure. Would you say yes or no? It depends on the photograph. I mean, in the good ones. - Yes... - No? Maybe you're right, but... - Yes, it's true. - Yes? Yes, I think so. But they're not so "ping” as... Well, no. I'd swear they are. But sure, sure... I read it somewhere, anyway. But this woman... I wouldn't like to be in her shoes. All day; every day, always working, having to party all the time... Imagine you're tired, you can' relax. You have to live up to expectations. But she doesn't work, she spends all day relaxing. Amassage all morning,.. Then something else, now this, then that... Yes, but having to be the life and soul wherever you go, must be very stressful. She always says that aside from being the granddaughter of you-know-who, she also works, she's a product that she herself has created, which is true, I believe her. Whatever she wears - except a tracksuit, though even then - she ends up in the media, everything she wears ends up in magazines. OK, but she always looks good, there's never.. She always looks great. Because shes always aware of the camera, always. I don't like her style, she's not my favourite celebrity. Who's your favourite? None, right now; it changes! But not her She doesn't inspire me much. She's boring after so many years. She hasn't changed her look. - She's always the same. - Always the same. - Always the same. - Always the same hair colour. - I prefer her sister. - No way! Yes, because she's more ordinary, more credible. - She isn't such a celebrity. - Idon' like her at all. - No? - I prefer her. You mean, physically, or...? Everything. She looks crazier, doesn't she? Sure, but there are people who are much crazier than her. I think I read that she's one of these religious types who do whatever they like but claim to have "principles”. Really? So after every scandal... I don't know; she said that she's a true believer.. Maybe she is. Actually, it isn't incompatible. With these kinds of things, we cant... What does she believe in? I think she simply said in God, that's all. Well, it wasn't... it was just a short article. She didn't explain her beliefs thoroughly, but she implied that she goes to mass, or used to go. I bet she was just drawing attention to herself. I'm not sure. There's a singer whose parents are protestant ministers... you would never guess. I mean, that she's been raised religiously, and that's part of her, but then she also does whatever she likes. I think that's fine. You do it too, right? Your parents are believers? Everybody does it. Well, me too, I'm a believer. Are you? Not like church-going types, but I'm a believer. What about you? Sometimes. But I believe there's just one god, for everybody. - What do you mean? - Yes... a general, universal energy that everyone calls whatever they like. OK, fine. Don't you? Nothing? - Some days. - Really? Yes. More in the past, Less nowadays. Less now.. But in the past, I'had a lot of faith. - Enough to go to mass? - No... No. ARM OF GOD Did you have a specific director in mind? I suppose... that he'll do it. I don't have much cash, and... he can be a disaster with money, but it doesn't matter Have you decided where we will shoot? Here, like you said before...? We need more material. I think a place like Poland could be good, everything's cheaper there... don't you think? Aplace like that, where everything,.. In these countries... What do you think? Will you sell your mother's apartment? Yes, no problem and I'll find more money. Where will she go? My mother will stay where she is! [I do something 50 she can stay... I'll sell it to a friend... who won't make use of it until she's dead. Unless I die first. Which would obviously be a cock-up... But we need the money right now: Well, that can be arranged. I can speak to a cousin of mine who is a lawyer, I can speak to him and well find a solution. I think I can get the money, it isn't so much, really. And how will we take the equipment? We'll take the cameras, and if we go to Poland we'll get the other equipment there, where it's really cheap, and there are very good... We can take two or three technicians from here, and get everything else there. Living expenses, hotels, everything is much cheaper there. And it's a very romantic country. Do you have any business partners? No, but I have friends in the film world, many friends... who can give me advice, and as I said, the money issue... can be resolved. What you think! You've produced other projects before, haven' you? Or is this your first? I'm involved in another... I'm at another level. Higher? If you're at a higher level, I can't get involved, because I can't move. I'm not interested in... making certain things any more. Yes, but you said you're interested in this project. I'm talking about... 500,000 Euros... 600,000, Do you think that we can... get this much? Yes, this much, I've told you, at most. Afterwards, other people... might turn up, we may have collaborators, it depends. Has your mother got any more apartments? No, but leave my mother out of it, let her die in peace, poor thing. No, no... That's not important. We might not have to sell her apartment. I find it hard to imagine what might be the equivalent of God's arm in our earthly life. God the creator - perhaps it could be the arm... of a painter, the arm of a writer... given the physical strength and the power needed, it would probably be... a painter's am. In an interview; Robert Motherwell, the well-known American painter, intellectual, and visionary, thrice-married, referred to his own arm, in the following way: "for years my summer studio has been directly on the bay, in Provincetown on Cape Code. There 53900-foot tidal flat and at high tide, the sea in a high wind, breaks against the bulkhead in a violent spray. In the "Beside the Sea" series, I made the painted spray with such physical force that the strong rag paper split, and it was only when I found rag paper laminated with glue in five layers that the surface could take the full force of my shoulder, arm, hand and brush without splitting. One might say that we the true way to 'imitate' nature is to employ its own processes”. I'm worried. Why? My partner is very demanding. Right. So far we've been operating in a standard way; but now we're moving to another level. Be careful. I can't guarantee anything, but it's highly likely.. That this won't be astandard installation. We're moving off the traditional path. We'l take risks. Take maximum risks. We need... What? I already operate on another level. And...? This level is extremely rich. We need to generate a lot of energy, but safely. I need a lot of power. OK... no problem. We're facing new challenges. We're taking maximum risks, all the way. Good. We have to start from the beginning and continue, stage by stage, calmly. It's very important to respect the hierarchy. Right. So far we've been using standard systems, and we shouldn't allow everything to turn to chaos. I can't guarantee anything, but it's highly likely that from now on we will go even higher. Good. My partners a very influential person. The structure is not the problem. What's the problem then? KING OF GOD Yes, I got it. Fine. We'll talk again tomorrow. Tomorrow. Yes, I'm listening. Yes. OK. See these three areas? They are also three important challenges. This part here is going to be demolished. It will be on everybody's lips. It will be impressive. We've spent many hours working on it. Others have tried before, without success. The main design is ours. Look, over there, there's going to be a platform that will move up and down on escalators, and also a slide for young people. What do you think about this view? This whole area... will be painted in a colour that we haven' decided yet, but it will be extremely interesting, because when the sun hits it, it will change shade. See? - That will be nice. - Yes. Look up there, pay attention, because it's going to change radically. There will be lasers that light up at night. You'll see how the people outside will notice it gradually. The laser will work slowly, it won't be... fast. - Very slowly. - Very slowly. - It's a great project. - Yes. It will certainly be one of the greatest projects to come to fruition, in this country, in recent years. Teamwork. That's the foundation: teamwork. Ateam of people bringing their enthusiasm, to the project, will make it possible. It sounds good. Really good. I can take care of this. - Excuse me? - I can take care of this. I know people. That's good to know. It might come in handy one day. This is the result of limitless talent. And above all, perseverance. Enormous perseverance. Many hours of preparation. I can already picture the official opening, everybody wondering: "How did he do it?" It will be amazing. - Impressive. - Impressive. Retirees will enjoy it too. All kinds of people, of all ages. New sensations. It will be fantastic to see it finished! Look carefully at these platforms because they will soon be gone. We'll put in some slides that go up and down, to delight visitors. The slides will be made out of stainless steel, but they'll be protected by air conditioning so that young people can go up and down without noticing, 3D will soon be obsolete. Wonderful. Here, there will be a huge mural painting with sensors that trigger a different image every five minutes, as people pass by. It will be exceptional. New generations will benefit from it. They'll be proud of us. Atrue project for the future. Genuine, real, not sophisticated, because it's real. Future generations will be grateful to us and we'll enjoy it, too. It is imminent. The slide will go here, it will go up and down, triggered by sensors like the mural. It will be a unique sensation. You will feel as if you are neither inside nor outside it, not going up or down. But even more importantly, it will make you feel alive. It will be extraordinary. That's right, extraordinary. It will be incredible, unprecedented, wonderful. And all thanks to a wonderful, enthusiastic, hard-working team, with mutual understanding, comradeship, and a truly sophisticated technique: imagination. The future is imminent. This is the project. PRINCE OF PEACE Gerard or Jerry, as you know, your father and I are old friends. He told me to speak to you about investing money in a production that I'm involved in. He told me that you're now the person who takes care of this money, because he's too old. I'm older than your father but... I don't have anyone to delegate to, so I'm still in charge of it. This production that I'm preparing is very ambitious. The most ambitious project of my life, but that isn't important. I've always loved films, since I was a child. I don't have money available right now. You don't have money? Then your father must be deluded, or... I don't know why he told me to talk to you. Sometimes he does these thing. And do you, personally, have money! We could see. Are you interested in cinema? Not really. Then... I'm talking to the wrong person. Indirectly, it's about the king, because it's about the prince, the son of the king. The mud-yellow floodlight, launched into orbit, after the prince planets. Invented gazes, visual scars, embedded into the spacecraft, beg for earthbound mouths. The mud-yellow floodlight, launched into orbit, after the prince planets. HUSBAND SON OF GOD Did they give you the instructions? Yes, I understand. I think everything's under control. I trust him, but I like to keep in touch with everybody. I'm a good contact. We need a lot of power this time. I have power. Can you give me guarantees? I don't have to worry?! I'm an expert on this subject. Don't forget that we operate on another level now. I know that. I also operate at higher levels, you don't need to worry. I have good equipment. We can't let everything turn to chaos. Is that clear? I don't think it will. You don't think so, or you know for sure? I know; I'm very sure. My equipment won't break down. As I told you, we aren't taking the traditional path. What path are you taking! Now we operate on another level, a very rich level. Are we talking about levels or paths? My partner is a very important person, his influence has no bounds. Is it a good idea to film in November... when it starts to snow? Roads with snow could be a problem. Can you resolve it? I can't get rid of the snow, but as I said, I have good equipment. Can't you just melt it? No. This time we'll need civil guarantees. Will you have them? I don't know what you mean. He's handsome. To you. He looks a little bit like you. He's got blue eyes. LAMB I've been speaking to people who are working on the production and there have been problems. There have been epidemics. Is there anything else? Yes, there are several problems. But the thing is, we cant allow lawyers to meddle. I need you to guarantee that you can solve this. Lawyers, of course... devils... I don't know; tell me more. You know what lawyers do, they meddle and then the production turns to chaos. We lose control. Don't you feel strong enough to fix it yourself? You should fix it. There are new problems. This will waste time, it will eat into... post-production time. Well, then... I'll have to make some phone calls. My partner is worried about the health issue. Is he ill There have been epidemics. And will that cause delays? Is he really ill? Where is he? In hospital? He's half-retired already. Right, but he can delegate to you. We must find a solution. We're also having problems with transportation. It's inadequate. People are having problems, they have cervical pain. Some of them are in hospital. What does the production manager say' The one who is there every day, I mean. He's very worried about the underground store. He doesn't understand why you put everything there. What underground store are you talking about? Last time you did it differently. I thought you took your work seriously but now I see that you don't. My partner and I are not happy about these health problems. They're very dangerous. I don't think it's a problem. I don't know... Don't you think your partner is a bit crazy! Or paranoid? These problems have affected us in other productions. Can we trust this partner of yours? He might be putting my money into other productions. He's a very influential person. Those are the ones who frighten me most. He's fine, the problem is the health conditions. I'm used to working at a different level. The workers you have supplied are inadequate, useless. You know exactly what the problem is, I've explained it to you. But you haven't come up with a solution. Do you know what's wrong with them? I think we should have another little chat. I need real solutions, right now. We can't wait any more. Tell me the root of the problem and I'll solve it. But I need to know what's behind it. Do you have any idea why they act like this? Why do they stop working when the sun comes out? Why do they stop being active? Why don't they have their own ideas? They only repeat what they hear. Did you rehearse too quickly? Didn't you train them well enough? What's the problem? You can tell me straight out. I don't know... straight out. Then, they've fucked you over. Wasn't there enough money? Didn't you train them... with the system we agreed on? Perhaps. Did you save part of the budget? No. Did you divert it to some other project? No. Then what's wrong? Explain it to me. We've got too many useless people. If some people aren' doing anything, make a list and we'll fire them. - I don't see any other solution. - Most of them are useless. I don't see any solution. They don't have their own ideas, that's serious. We already knew that. I should have known. You knew that we work in the art world. We can't work with parrots. Hell, I think... this production might kill me before it's over. I don't see any solution. This is getting complicated. Do you think that our employees could be taking drugs? I'd like to discuss some aspects with you. I've heard that in your last production there were many births. Sheer jealousy. Surely you know that some people envy my work. Can you promise me that there weren't an excessive number of births? Sit down with me and you'll see. I'll prove it to you. Are we going to sit again? Yes, you and I, one day we'll sit down and talk about it. Do you see what I mean? - Not really. - Well... We're already sitting together. Some things can't be explained right now. But at least you understand that the health issue is very important. Hey, man, I told you before! Someone mentioned the African workers. They said that your productions had problems with African workers. There cant be be wounded people. You'll see... with the final result, you'll realise that I work at a very high level. Trust me. Remember that wounded people can be more expensive than dead ones. That's been fixed. You don't have to worry. Can you give me guarantees on all this? Civil guarantees. Yes. You'll have them. The worst thing that can happen to a production is an epidemic. There's no problem. How did you deal with the last epidemic? You mean in Africa? Yes. I have very good physicians in Africa... and good friends. Don't you trust me? Friends in the government? Excuse me? Are your friends in the government? I have friends who are physicians, and you ask me about the government? About African governments. I have many friends in government there. Did they help you to hide the consequences of the last epidemic? That's how I managed to get out of trouble, they helped me. The epidemic didn't prevent you from finishing the production? In your productions, people are treated very badly. Alittle ill-treatment is tolerable, but at these levels it ends up being counterproductive. Do you think so? Yes. You're mistaken. Everything has been foreseen. They told me they had a lot of pain in their legs. Why is that? What did they say? That they felt pain in their legs. But they're fine now. People talk about things they don't know. That's what they told me. Hearsay! Aproduction like this is not feasible. It isn't feasible for you, but it is for me. No one can work with such pain. What did you give them to make it go away! I just told you that I have influence... Did you give them drugs? ...and physicians who have healed them all. I don't know what they gave them. I asked some friends of mine, and they agreed to cure them, and they did. But are your friends really physicians? Yes. Of course they are. - With a degree in medicine? - Yes. Can I speak to one of your workers? Of course. You can speak to several of them. I like to meet everybody in person. You'll meet them. And they'll all tell you that they feel at ease. That they feel fine. And how will I know they aren't on drugs? Well... you can tell straight away, right? We have to do it all in one day. BELOVED You can stay and sleep, if you want. - Do you want to? - No. - Sorry? - If we have to go, let' go. But you can stay if you like. Don't you feel comfortable? Yes, just great. Then stay. - Will you stay? - I don't think so. Think it over. - Will you stay? - No. Hey... - Are you sure? - Positive. You're tough. Very tough. What if somebody else asked you? Then I'd consider it. You know who I mean, don't you? - What if he asked you? - Who? Him. Whenever he tells you to do something, you do it. Don Juan was sleeping. He had rested his legs on the half-rotten table, which I'd once used as a reading table. His legs were swollen, at first, while he was eating, he barely opened his eyes. Even later after a glance, a brief twinkle, they remained almost closed. But now these closed eyes expressed something else. Eating like that, excited his imagination, or perhaps it was his fantasy. No. Soon, he felt an inner rhythm that had nothing to do with whether he liked what he was eating. You're a bit flustered. - Yeah, sure. - Alittle bit. The window. Should we forget about it? OK, let's go. I don't want to go anywhere with you. I'd just be talking to myself all the time. - Wouldn't I? - Maybe. For sure. Things were already like this before. But now it seemed that, little by little, it was starting to matter to them. Until the very last moment, Don Juan had been waiting for something to happen to them, to contradict the course of events. Such as? No questions, he gestured, scolding me. As he turned, he stepped on a woodpile, and the couple noticed his presence. He rectified. It wasn't the cracking sound that made the couple turn around, it was his sigh. The sigh of the observer. Asigh of deception. No more questions. Be that as it were, I have rarely heard a sigh like the sigh of Don Juan. While he continued to tell his story, and also while he sat there quietly, all week long, his sigh could be heard. It was the sigh of an old man and at the same time, that of a child. It was very soft, or even tender, but it could be heard through all other sounds. The rumble of cars from the main road, which once again cut through the valley of Rodon. The roar of the bombers that spent seven days beating out the rhythm of their Pentecostal manoeuvres overhead. Don Juan's sighs gave me confidence, not just in the man himself. But the two lovers perceived his sigh as treason. They were furious, but not because someone had been looking at them. Suddenly; they put on their overalls and ran towards him, because the observer; through his sigh, had dishonoured everything that they had just experienced together and everything that remained alive between them, perhaps invisibly. But as usual, in any situation, Don Juan didn't want to escape. He wasn't supposed to escape. He had no permission to escape. And as usual, he ultimately had no other choice. He had to escape. In the end, Don Juan was let down by the couple. Everything happened as if it had been foreseen. First you could hear them both. Later, the woman's screams were heard, and the man made a groaning sound. She fell face down, and put one hand behind her back and with the other hand he scratched his knee, which was bent again. Lost among her screams, she said a word that sounded like "love”, and he whispered something similar. Don Juan should have withdrawn earlier. Now it changed nought that a cuckoo was heard singing in threes instead of twos, like stuttering. The truth is that he performed his duty, and kept on looking. But as he did so, he counted the seconds. Rather, he simply voiced the numbers, as one does when one is forced to remain in one place or when time drags on too long. And for Don Juan time was a problem. It was the problem. Are you religious? Yes, I'm very religious. I mean... I'm religious in the sense that I... think... I don't really believe in God... I'mean, I think it's obvious that there is something else. That seems logical. But anyway... It's difficult to explain these things. I always avoid talking about politics and religion, because they can never be expressed fully, 50 there's no point. But, increasingly... I think it's important to have... moral values. Ultimately, I'm becoming more practical In the spiritual sense. I think... God and all that stuff, are simply images, and that's fine, but if you don't put together some morals that you can apply... in an effective way.. It's no use to you. The rest is simply a kind of empty poetry, right? But this is a thorny subject. You put religion and politics on the same level. Can you say something about this? What is your opinion on politics? I'm not interested in politics at all. I avoid it like the plague. It's a popular subject that comes up in conversations at business dinners for example, but I try as hard as I can to avoid getting into these realms, these issues that are always very complicated, and annoy people because they have very strong beliefs. I'm the complete opposite. I'm totally apolitical, It isn't that... I'm not politically aware, but I can see the good things about the Left and the good things about the Right, So... basically I don't follow any political party or any specific ideology, I'm not an activist, and I hate the gregarious feeling at demonstrations and so on. I go my own way and... none of that interests me. That's why I like artists, because they go their own way and they don't care about that whole world of politics, in which people are like sheep. - Just a moment. - Sorry? Look straight ahead. OK. Can you repeat that please! That's why I like the art world, because artists go their own way, and they aren't... involved in the world of politics, where people are like sheep, and which is vulgar. With artists, you may or may not agree, you may or may not like their work, but they have, I don't know how to put it - an individual presence. Other people seem to merge into the crowd. I like to talk to people face to face, with a particular person who has his own ideas. I don't care whether they're right-wing or left-wing, I really don't care... whether they have prejudices... as long as... they behave with a modicum of manners. Silence! And art is precisely the opposite of politics. It uses creativity. It means... taking risks, doing something different. The complete opposite of following an ideology, a party or a movement. This is why... artists' groups never work. An artist is always alone. That's why I'm in the art world. Because in the art world the important thing is creativity, and the individual, the creativity of the individual, and not some supposed creativity of society, these abstract concepts used in politics, which don't refer to real things. It's just about winning elections, which means power, which means... money. Everybody knows that. And some people like it. But I don't. Why do you work in the art world? I work in art because I want to help artists, I like what they do. I like their work, it's enriching, I've even lost money; quite often. And I'll lose money again. Do you think that you and the artists you work with are like a family? I wouldn't say a family, exactly. Because the word "family” takes you back into... Or perhaps we are. Perhaps we are a family, but only some of them, not all. If you include all of them: no. Otherwise it's another concept, like political parties and all that stuff... religion. Even though I'm religious. But I believe in the individual, I believe in the artist, and when artists start... to create these groups and these concepts, I lose interest. It isn't real. Family isn't real either. JESUS Hi. - Is everything ready? - It is. - I hope nothing goes wrong. - It won'. An excerpt from Carlyle's book On Heroes that talks about Odin, a very important figure in Scandinavian paganism: “Let us look for a little at the hero as divinity, the oldest primary form of heroism. Surely it seems a very strange thing, this Paganism; almost inconceivable to us, in these days. Abewildering, inextricable, jungle of delusions, confusions, falsehoods and absurdities, covering the whole field of Life! Athing that fills us with astonishment, almost, if it were possible, with incredulity - for truly it is not easy to understand that sane men could ever calmly, with their eyes open, believe and live by such a set of doctrines. That men should have worshipped their poor fellow-man as a God, and not him only, but stocks and stones, and all manner of animate and inanimate objects; and fashioned such a distracted chaos of hallucinations by way of Theory of the Universe: all this looks like an incredible fable. Nevertheless, it is a clear fact that they did it. Such hideous inextricable jungle of misworships, misbeliefs, men, made as we are, did actually hold by, and live at home in. This is strange. Yes, we may pause, in sorrow and silence, over the depths of darkness that are in man; if we rejoice in the heights of purer vision he has attained to. Such things were and are in man; in all men; in us too.” I'll put all of you in the fucking dog pound! All of youl! All All of youl! Yes. There are many problems. I've been speaking to everyone. I think I've found a solution. Everybody should wear a uniform. Yes. No, red. With grey stripes. OK. No. For summer and in winter. Ok, then make them... for summer. For winter then. Make two, make... This production is continuing for too long, We'll work through winter and part of the summer. Ok, make them for winter. But... otherwise they'll be cold. It doesn't matter. The day after tomorrow. Everything has to be ready. I'll come by helicopter. Don't confuse me, just do what you have to do. Do what I told you, and that's it.
