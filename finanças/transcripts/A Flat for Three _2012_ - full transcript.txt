Ulisse ! - Who is it ? - Ulisse... - Who is it ? - Parcel. l'm coming. l'm double-parked ! l'm coming, l'm coming...

Bye, thanks. l____,lo, l have periarthritis _ You did that on purpose _ - l didn't know. - l already told you mice _ - Shall l close it ? - l____,lo, leave it open. Ma'am, are you turning o_ the water at half past nine ? How long will this work go on ? Goddammit _ What a sad life, l don't even have water _ Who is it ? Fabrizio... How are you ? l____,lo, it's not a favour. You're doing me a favour Ietting me stay here. When ? Tell me, l'll leave right away. l'll be o_ your boat in five. Tomorrow afternoon ? Goddammit _ Don't worry, l'll find somewhere else to stay. Don't worry, you're still the best. You're the best _ See you tomorrow, thanks. Bye. Motherfucker _ Where'll l go now, under a bridge ? Come in. Mother, good morning. l've brought you my monthly rent. l may come back late tonight. Around midnight, l'm inte_iewing people at a film premiere. Mr Brignola, l think you've mistaken this place for a hotel. l'll make no other requests. l'm looking for a place, l'm seeing someone today. That's very sensible. l want to give you... one of my books that l think will interest you. ''Dogma of the Image in l____,lew Asian Cinema.'' Don't look at the cover. - Have a good day. - You too. - Here l am. - Okay. - Sorry. - Don't worry. Sorry l'm late. - Brignola, nice to meet you. - Diamanti. - You're standing in for Mr Segato... - Isn't that you ? - l____,lo, l've come to see a flat. - Me too. Here he is _ - Mr Brignola. - l____,lo, l'm Diamanti, he's Brignola. l must've made a mistake. Who wants to see it first ? - l've got a delivery arriving. - l have an inte_iew to do. Let's kill mo birds with one stone and see it together _ - Let's go _ - All right then... This place has everything you need. There are about eight square metres upstairs too, l think. We've seen it. Eight metres which could be handy one day for a child... - Yes... - Just a thought, you know. Of course... but the ad said it was ''furnished''. - l can only see a buzzer _ - Yes, but it has electricity, gas... - Those are the basics _ - There's not even a fridge _ - Why did you say ''furnished'' ? -You'll need to buy a few things _ Anyway, the rent's GOO euros per month, plus 150 bi-monthly se_ice charge and 3 monthi deposit. So to live in this dump you want... 2,550 euros. That's GOO euros per month plus the rest. What did you expect for that price ? - You're welcome to it. - l____,lo, l can't a_ord it. Guys, you knowwhat you'll find that's cheaper than this ? Catacombs _ Okay, it's not suitable for your needs, let's say that. l have your numbers. - l'll give you mine. - Great. You dropped this. l've already done it, l like to try, you never know. lt's not suitable for our needs. Think it over, Mr Brignola. This is a great apartment. Okay, we will. My client is requesting an extra 100 euros per month on top of the 400 euros maintenance. Your Honour, as our counterparty's Iawyer knows, my client already pays 200 euros maintenance for his daughter. - This extra 100 euros... - And the mortgage ? l pay GOO euros monthly for the mortgage on the house my ex-wife lives in. l only have TOO euros left out of my 1 ,_OO euros wage. 100 euros may seem like little, but in these conditions it's a matter of su_ival for me. This is notjust a whim on my client's behalf, but a contribution to her daughter's maintenance. After all, it's certainly not my client's fault we're here. Giorgia... what's up ? Lorenza _ Here's daddy. Lorenza _ Didn't you hear the baby ? Where are you ? Won't you answer me ? Here you are. Why are you sitting in the dark ? l was reading these emails that are worthy of a cheap novel. This is what she says to you. ''Darling... l can't wait for Friday so l can kiss you in the sun.'' - Very passionate, really. - l can explain. l'm worried about you. You're so distracted by love you forgot to sign out. You reply: ''l can't wait for the weekend, just the mo of us.'' And how do you describe me ? ''A woman destroyed by post-natal depression, dull, sick... with no zest for life.'' Thanks. Darling, l wrote those things _enwe were... -Wewere... - You're disgusting _ You cheated on me with your bosi wife _ - l can explain _ - Like hell you can _ ln view of the facts, l grant Mrs Mauri's request and order Mr Brignola to pay 100 euros monthly in addition to the agreed amount.

You can't have a kid at 18, but you insisted _ ln these five years, you've forgotten that l'm an artist, notjust a housewife and mother. - Why are you complaining ? - Why am l complaining ? Okay, l knowwhat, you look after Agnese today. Be a father for one day _ Well, really... Dad, will you and mom make up ? Sure, moms and dads always argue, then make up. What have you brought me ?

This is a major problem _ - Don't think of it as a problem. - Holy shit _ l___,,lo, you can get anywhere in ten minutes. Ten minutes. ln ten minutes we'll be under rubble.

Why did you live in your shop ? l was one of Europe's biggest music producers. l brought loads of international artists to Italy, won three golden discs... And then ? The head company in London went bust, a series of fiascos, including my wife's record that l produced, more out of love than conviction. Then one disaster after another.

He played naked, he didn't wear a shirt _ lt's crocodile skin, anyway. Fulvio, let's not confuse junk with vintage, which is serious. Don't you dare, this watch belonged to my father. Yes, but not to Frank Zappa. That's nonsense. He had a serious hypotension seizure. With what he took he should go to the hospital. l've written it all down, he should have an ECG. - l didn't get that, sorry. - An ECG. Are you his friends ? Let's say we live together. Tell him not to take those things, they're bad for him. These are private matters, we hardly know each other. That's right, we hardly know each other _ - We chose the wrong house... - Why tell her ?

Who's the ''idiot'' ? - Your husband. - l___,,lo, a guy l was with for three years. Tonight he left me, saying we're incompatible... Don't say that word. But these things happen in life. - Has it happened to you too ? - Of course... Yes, a long time ago. lt happened to me mo hours ago, it's not the same _ Don't shout, we'll wake everyone. Sorry. l wouldn't worry about it. Things always work out in the end. - 100 euros. - What ? - For the visit. - Of course, l see. - Is the invoice name Segati ? - Segato, Domenico Segato. The number we called you from. l don't know his VA_ number. l'm 20 euros short. l could ask him, but... That's okay, you've been so kind, thanks. Thank you. So we don't need to worry about Domenico ? He should have an ECG and take the stu_ l've prescribed. But we don't want to worry about you either. Try to stay calm about it because incompatibility... l____,lo, l meant ''di_iculties''.

Tell me the exact words he said. He said that you're sick, that you need help and that a sick person cannot help the sick. He said that ? He said a sick person cannot help the sick. - A sick person ? - You _ You're sick, okay ? - Hug me. - Hug you ? Oh God, l feel faint. Let me sit down. l feel so relaxed. What a clear sky. Look how many stars. But it's so cloudy. - Is it ? - Yes. You're right. Sorry, but l feel so strange... lt's been a tough day... l can see stars too now _ What happened with your wife ? Are you still friends ? So, so, not really, but l get on well with my daughter. l don't see her often because she lives in Paris but we talk. - She's a great girl. - Paris is lovely... lt is _ Have you always had a passion for music ? Yes, but it's more than a passion. When l was a record producer, it was great... Music was di_erent. - It was something else. - There's music now too. Yes, but it's not the same. You're the classic type who thinks the old days were the best _ l'd like to point out that good things happen now too. Lucky you, you're such an optimist. Boo to you, you're stuck in the past _ - Is that yours vibrating ? - Mine ? - l'm in my pyjamas, it must be yours. - Oh God _ lt's him _ Was that you calling my house phone ten minutes ago ?

Maybe we can take a few photos outside later... So... Miss Gaia... - After your role in... - ''lschia''. After your role in ''lschia'' you were voted ''Best girl'' for this year. That's quite an achievement as you're only 21 ... l___,,lo, l'm 20 actually. Just call me Gaia. Let's start from the beginning, your studies... l____,lo, let's move on. Let's talk about your aspirations. Do you want to continue starring in soap operas ? Of course, TV has been a great opportunity for me. Even if in actual fact my dream is to star in films. What director would you like to work with ? As it's a dream, l'll tell you. My ideal partner is Matt Damon. We'd be good together. While as director... l think Muccino is the best. - Am l dreaming too much ? - l____,lo _ lt's a feasible dream. l know him, l've written about him many times... You know Gabriele Muccino ? Yes. Good morning _ My goodness, there was no parking _ l walked for miles. l probably won't find my car now _ - What a surprise, ma'am _ - Ma'am ?
