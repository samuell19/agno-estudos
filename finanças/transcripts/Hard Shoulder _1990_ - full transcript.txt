[music playing] [footsteps approaching] [rain pattering] [side conversation] Tony, hang on a minute. TONY: Come on. We missed the bus. [sighing] JACKIE: Look, um, I'm going to go on to a club, OK? Because it's Katcha's birthday. OK. We'll see ya. Oh, come here. Good luck tomorrow. Thanks. I'll need it. See ya. And you can buy the pints tomorrow night. You'll be loaded. [inaudible] [chatter on police radio] [rain pattering] LANDLADY: I'm terrible sorry, love. This was always a quiet house. Ah, I'm sure they'd rob anyone these days. [phone ringing] You've just returned from abroad. [phone ringing] That's the taxi. Are you sure you won't stay? [clock ticking] [muffled music playing] [buzzing] CHARLIE HENSHAW (ON INTERCOM): Whenever they're ready. [inaudible] RECEPTIONIST: No. Ms. Burke? [muffled music playing] Ms. Burke? [muffled music playing] CHARLIE HENSHAW: Ah, right. Come on in. Sit down, sit down. [clock ticking] Ah, Tony. Charles Henshaw, sole Irish agent for resale fire extinguishers. Hello. Oh, right. [sighing] Well, that's what we're selling. That looks great, really handy. CHARLIE HENSHAW: Feel it, touch it, get to know it. Great color. It's lovely. They're more than lovely. Hand held, finger on, finger off. Lovely machines. We're very lucky to have them. Now, have you done any selling before, Tony? No, but, but I-- CHARLIE HENSHAW: That's all right. I-- Rule number one. Get the demo in. Seeing is believing. And they won't buy it unless you make them believe it. Wait till you see the whites of their eyes. There. [coughing] It's that easy. Now you try it. Don't be afraid of it. Pour it on. Wait. Leave it. [coughing] TONY: It works. There you are. You have it. God, it's good, isn't it? Nothing to it. Now listen, I'll take 10 quid for every one you sell, and you keep anything above that. Now, I'd recommend 20 quid or 19.95. Well, that's fair, isn't it? Oh, yes. That seems fine. Oh, and I need identification. You know, I have to uh, cover myself. Is [inaudible] all right? Yeah, fine. So, 9:30 tomorrow. See you then. [music playing] Ow. CHARLIE HENSHAW: And always remember, people want to buy what you're selling. And all you have to do is give them a little push. It's just a matter of giving them what they want. And they love it down here. I mean, it's a great product, that extinguisher. Now, what happens if they won't let you do the demo? CHARLIE HENSHAW: Look at it this way. You're selling what stops fire. That's important. You're selling security. Now, is everyone clear on everything? Yeah. You know, selling is the only game in the world where the sky is the limit, no matter what you're selling. I mean, look at Rockefeller, [inaudible], Hector Gray, Carnegie. Did you ever hear of them? Tony? - Yeah. There you are. And they started selling small, tuppenny matches, pins, razorblades. Look at them now. They're household names. (WHISPERING) You've got egg on your fly. CHARLIE HENSHAW: Now just remember, get the demo in. All set, Ella? Yeah. Raring to go. Two for you. There you go. And two for you. Thanks Couple, huh? Great idea. Right. I'm going to see if there's any phone calls for me in the office. I'll see you back here in an hour. OK. CHARLIE HENSHAW: And listen, spread out. Don't just stick to the main street. Right, Mr. Henshaw. [knocking] [coughing] - Yes? - Hello. Morning. We're in the area selling fire extinguishers that are really good. They're very handy, perfect for around the house. If you let me, I, I'll give you a demonstration. Uh, no thanks, love. [muffled music playing] I'll try the next one. [muffled music playing] [music stops] [birds singing] [knocking] [clears throat] Thanks. Looks tough. Beginner's luck. Are you going to try it? You've got to relax, ease them into it. Ah, yeah. Right. [gasping] WOMAN: Oh, Jesus. 20 quid and we forget the VIT. It, it certainly was very impressive. Are you going to buy one? WOMAN: Ah, no. [inaudible] we wouldn't have the money for one of those. But, uh, thanks all the same. Well, Michael, how many? One. CHARLIE HENSHAW: It could be worse. How did you two get out? OK. None. Not to worry. Better luck, bit more experience. I got rid of four of them. Four? CHARLIE HENSHAW: Just hit a good patch. Where's the other two? Saw them getting on a bus about an hour ago. They looked pretty lost. Did they have the gear with them? MICHAEL: Don't know. Maybe they dumped them. Selling can be very hard. You have to stick at it, even when it hurts. When are we eating? We'll wait till we get to the next town. We'll sell loads there. Yeah right? Right. Right. MICHAEL: That was a pretty good job. We worked their own hours, within reason. But that only lasted four-- no, five months. And it was then that that panel thing came through, and I started as a training assistant manager in Dunnes. You had to work Saturdays. It was good work. [radio playing] You knew where you stood. Then that strike thing happened. Things got really messy. [radio playing louder] Do you want to turn that down a bit, please? Sorry. [radio playing louder] [chuckling] [bell ringing] ELLA: Get the demo in? - Yeah. Left the place in flames. Ah, cup of coffee. WAITRESS: It's not working. It looks like it does. WAITRESS: Well, it doesn't. Thanks. [bell ringing] That man asked me, was it hot. What? The extinguisher. I said, no. He bought one. Who are they? Old things. TONY: Let's see. [chuckling] My mother died just after that was taken. TONY: What about your father? He's not worth knowing. TONY: Hm. Somewhat of a [inaudible]. Why'd you come back? You know what that jacket makes you look like? What? ELLA: Some Paul Daniel's creep. Thanks. Presto. Hey, presto. How many have you sold? Three. What about you? About to. What? Hold up. This is good for a bit of [inaudible]. [inaudible] Look, there's no sense in heading off [inaudible]. Look, here, [inaudible]. Trouble. [inaudible] MICHAEL: I've never seen them before in me life. CHARLIE HENSHAW: But you must have said something to them. I said nothing to them. They just came at me, the three of them, had a chance. And what had I done to them? Nothing, the bastards. Come on, Michael. Take it easy. Come on. Stop worrying. I was just walking on, minding my own business. Look, it was a mistake, Michael. They probably thought you were someone else. What happened to you? Are you all right? And look at me jacket, it's completely destroyed. Look, I, I'll see you're all right with the jacket. I know a tailor who will do a good job. Now, come on. Let's get into the car. ELLA: What happened, Michael? Look, some fellas roughed him up. They probably thought he was someone else. Look, you get the rough element everywhere. They said tell fire balls you were asking for him. What's that supposed to mean? Look, Let's talk about it in the car. Come on. You know what you can do with your car. Ah, Michael-- And your extinguishers. Michael, take it easy. How's he going to get back to Dublin? Leave him. Leave him. It's just a bit of bad luck. Come on, let's go. Jesus, fire balls. Look, forget it. Come on. Let's get out of here. [music playing] Some people can't take it, the rough and the smooth, I mean. I don't know. Michael must have really annoyed them. ELLA: Who? How should I know? Will you leave that alone? Do you know what I was thinking? We should go out West. We'd sell loads out there. I haven't even had far long enough to have even heared of these extinguishers. I'd pay for half the hotels and that. Well? All right. Fair play, Tony. Ella? Are you with us? For how long? CHARLIE HENSHAW: As long as it takes. OK. CHARLIE HENSHAW: I knew you wouldn't let me down. [music playing] I know work is hard to get, Tony, but it just doesn't seem like a proper job. Look Jackie, I worked and I got paid. But you need to know how much money you have coming in every week. Oh, come on. How long with you be away? I don't know. I'll call you. Yeah. Sure. [music playing] [dog barking] [beeping] MAN (ON RECORDER): Ah, I have a provisional driving license, and I used to walk in a bookshop. Me-- [fast-forwarded speech] [beeping] MAN (ON RECORDER): Charlie, are you there? Call me now and let me know how you're selling that gear. And don't leave me waiting.

Ah, it works all right. But I'm not buying anything today. How do you mean you're not buying anything today? Look, have you got an extinguisher? I have a big one in there. It would put out a burning house. In here? Ha. I wouldn't trust those old things. Let you down when you need them. I know that type. Look, I'm telling you straight, pal, you can't afford not to have one of these. Do you live up there? I'm not buying one. Have you family? Children? Why? You need this, pal. I'm telling you. Fires start awful easy. What are you saying? I'm saying you have to buy this for your own safety. Get out of here. I'm not afraid of you. There's no one around here that would be afraid of you.
