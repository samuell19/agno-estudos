Nice to meet you. Thanks for stopping by. I'm Dave the editor. I love your work... ...and I'm delighted we're working together on this project I really am. My pleasure. I must admit to being surprised. Before we met I'd assumed you were female. May I ask why you have a girl's name? My real name is Makoto Segawa. But no-one calls me Makoto any more. Now I am Shizuru Satonaka... I've never spoken to anyone about why I came to be called by this name... ...why I started using it. Even if I did... ...I don't think anyone would believe me. But it's true. Every bit of it. That was the dayl got fired as a photographer. And for such a stupid reason. The client rejected all my photographs for an ad he wanted me to do for some loan sharks. It was just the kind of thing I knew was going to happen. Mr. Shirahama, are you okay, Sir? Please tell me you're not hurt! The crappy third-rate model who just happened to be the client's girlfriend, didn't like my pictures. I could've been killed! I'm so sorry. I'll make it up to you on the next j There'll be no next job! Your company's never going to work again! That hurt... How dare you treat your clients like that?! What? Don't flatter yourself. Huh? I dare you say that again. Amateur, amateur, amateur! You die bastard! And that's how I lost my job as a photographer. Man, that hurts. I'd left university, avoided a proper job... ...worked my ass off to become a professional photographer, and this was the result. Memories always sneak upon you out of the blue That was the day I received a letter from the girlfriend I'd split up with three years before. What's up? I'm the same as ever. It's been three years already. I hope this letter reaches you. I'm in New York. I longed to see the world of Basquiat and Jarmusch, that you told me about. At first, all I saw was concrete... But when I threw myself into it, I found a world of wonder. Every street is like a movie set, where a worldwide cast plays out the drama of life Memories always sneak up on you outof the blu That's why I always carry a camera I didn't want to lose that memoryof your words. So I started taking pictures. Norita, Harlem, Soho, Bronx, Hell's Kitchen. If I see anything interesting... just like you taught me: Focus and press the shut I was playing around, giving the photos to friend But one day, an editor really liked them. Can you believe, I'm putting on an exhibition? It's you I want to see it most. Maybe you're busy, but I really want you to come Looking at her photos I was surprised, entertained, moved all at the same time. It was like she'd managed to capture all the wonder she'd encountered on the streets of New York and then convey it to me with incredible power. There was no way I could take pictures like these. My God! Here we go. Yeah, like the magazine "An-An" You know it? We're doing a piece on student fashions... That's so cold. Don't talk in English, wierdo. He's overdosed on the Queen's English Can you watch movies without subtitles? Terminator 2, Independence Day...? Difficult. So what's the point? What're you doing? I'm in the process of finishing a photographic assignment. Nobody talks like that. Put aside the cares of this world. Let's work for a happier world. You're really with An-An? Hey, what's your major? French Lit. Cool. I love Shakespeare. Hey, Makoto! With a girl like that? What's he up to? What a smile! Give us a bit more. Fantastic. Perfect. That's really beautiful. Just a few more. Your pictures really are good. You think? Hot Co-Eds Share Sex Secrets Anybody, anytime. What the hell's this? It DOES say "An-An"! "An-An... An" Stop chanting! Help... help me! In that gorgeously rich backlight of the early Spring sun she was stunning. I met Shizuru. Would you take my picture? We'd only just met but all I could think was... ...I've found the one. Okay? Sure. It should be interesting. You've got a motor-drive? Yes, I do. Right. Let's get our picture taken. Here? Now? Is that a problem? No, but... Sorry to make you wait. Kissy kissy. Shut your eyes. Make sure you get it. Asshole. Get out of here. C'mon. What're you doing? Run! What the hell was that about? Did you see the rainbow? Hang on a sec... Wasn't that a little wonder? What? When your heart races... when you're over the moon, scared stiff... that feeling of wonder. It's none of my business. Did you get it? The photo? If they're any good, I want one of the punch to give to my friend. Your friend? That jerk messed her around. Serves him right. Can I have this? Alright. Thank you. What's your number? Memories always sneak up on you. It seems that I was the only one who didn't know... ...but Shizuru was notorious throughout the college. She was a total enigma. It seemed she had connections everywhere. Shizuru Satonaka Present Did you answer for Shizuru? She asked me to. You know her? She's off doing research. Research? Someone said she writes for a magazine. Something over in L.A. Really. I guess so. She lives in a great place. A posh apartment downtown. She's a real puzzle that one. Stop crying. Crying won't change a thing. Let it go. There. Hold on to it. What a view! Take my picture. Go on, take it. On top of the world! Top of the world... Pretty good, huh? So these are real photos. It's like a magic door. Magic door? Like in that kid's story. Open it up and there's a whole new world. You just step through it. Reach through through the frame... Through to the smells and sounds of the city. In that place, I feel like... ...I'll find myself again. It's a lovely picture. Just like a little kid singled out for praise by his teacher, my heart soared. For a moment, I felt like I had glimpsed the meaning of why I was born... ...what I was here on this earth to do... Are you sure you got it? Are you fed up? Done enough yet? Okay, my turn. Let me take you. It's all blurry. What do I do? Focus it. This one here? Shoot if you must. You'll blow your own hand off, too. Shoot if you must. You'll blow your own hand off, too. Even her majesty doesn't cry over spilt milk. Even her majesty doesn't cry... Which one's the bad guy? What are you worried about? Don't be embarrassed. Is this a new jacket? What a cute thermos. Wife get that for you? I guess you don't want to hear it... ...but there's something I want you to know. What are you doing? What? I made those copies. Thank you. How much? Forget it. Why are you mad? Is it TRUE you're dating Shizuru? Not really dating... She just models for me now and then. What is it? Dr. Ichiyama's English Lit. Class is cancelled, right? You know why? He took Shizuru on a trip to Hokkaido. For a dirty weekend. Did you really see it? Yes. I did! Hey! Don't leave me all alone. What's up? Nothing special. What's that? Forget it. That's not an answer. Let it go. Why are you being so strange? It's from my Mom's grave. My Mother was always on her own. But she had you. Sure she did. But my Dad was never around. He was married to someone else. I was the end of her happiness. How can you say that? It's true. I was born and she went from adored mistress to unwed mother. I was a burden, so she was dumped. Sorry to drag you into it... It's okay. What? There's talk about you and Dr. Ichiyama. You must think I'm disgusting... Not at all. It's okay. You don't have to lie. I'm not lying. The thing about Ichiyama... ...is that he's my Father. Really? I spread the rumors about us being lovers, to get back at him. You're the only one who's going to get hurt by that. It was the sourest tangerine I'd ever eaten. I felt like it tasted of her pain. Thank you for listening. Don't go. Stay longer. How much longer? Until we finish the tangerines. She moved in with me the next day. Good morning. Your hair's a disaster. And for today's quiz... Will 'Mayo-Noodles' pass the taste test? No way. And the correct answer is... Teach me how to take photos. Find something interesting. I can't focus. That's exposure. Try the next one. What are you doing? Get down. No. Get down! Not in a million years. Then I'll drag you off! It's danger. I'm really sorry. Forget it. Didn't I do well to fix it? I nearly gave up. The shutter didn't sound right. It wasn't completely dry. Like when you dry out a cellphone... I worried about making it up to you. A good chance. You should talk to them. Look at me! Let me have it. So? They're amazing. Really? Am I a genius? Perhaps. But this one's my favorite. Don't flatter yourself. It was the first one on the roll. You switched cameras. No, I didn't. The camera shop called. They can't fix the water damage. You didn't need to lie. Sorry. Naughty boy. Naughty boy? A naughty boy and a jerk. A naughty boy and a jerk? A naughty boy, a jerk, boring, a bully, lazy, over-sexed with smelly feet. Wait a minute. Don't be so gentle with me. I wasn't being gentle. Thanks. Here you go. Of course, it was one of her pictures. Makoto. Photo Contest Let's hope we both get through. It's 'win' not 'get through'. You're not as dumb as you look. Get lost. Two... three... Makoto SEGAWA... We are sorry to inform you... Shizuru SATONAKA... Special Commendation... I'm home. The last day of school... Lucky you getting a job in TV. I didn't get a single offer. What are you doing, Makoto? I'm going to be a photographer. Professionally? Will you apprentice with someone? I guess... ...if you have it on you name card, you're already a pro, right? I don't think it's that easy. I'm home. It's a good idea. I'm sure you can do it. Don't patronise me. I didn't win an award or anything. I'm not patronising you. I don't want pity. An award-winning genius wouldn't understand. We got the award together. You won it. I never wanted an award. Then why the hell apply? Just trying to show me up? I wanted to share your world. Breathe the same air, see the same things. Laugh together, be moved together. I wanted to be with you forever. Just the two of us. Together forever. You're so far ahead of me. What do you mean? In a different world. You don't want us to be together? Although you may not believe me... I really think you can become a pro Thank you. I've got it. We won't see each other until you become a pro. No contact whatsoever. Whatever. You may not want to see me then but... I'll wait for you. I'm off, then. And we never saw each other again. March 7 th, 2000 February 7 th, 2003 There's a fracture... ...just here. It must hurt. Even so, it's kind of rude... provocative at best. He's gone. Yeah? Hello, Makoto? It's me. But working in TV is so cool. You're one of the top women in the field. It's such a male-dominated world, though. We're still not taken seriously. I see your reports on TV all the time. Really? Shirahama tapes them. Creepy. Class reunions are all about people boasting about themselves. If you have nothing to boast about, you don't go. I stuck out like a sore thumb. Makoto. You came after all. You haven't changed. Did you hear... about Shizuru? I was in New York at the time, reporting. She was killed, a year ago. Don't talk bullshit. I met the detective in charge, by coincidence. He confirmed her name and everything. I got a letter from her today. You're still in touch? Must be someone else then. There's no way she could have died. No way. Shit! Before I knew what I was doing, I was on a plane for New York with nothing more than that single photograph of hers. Man, it's cold. It was my first time in New York and it all seemed pretty quiet to me. Would you be so kind as to convey me to this place? Please take me here. No, this is not it. It is not here, either. No, you don't understand. Do you hear me? I want to go here. I don't want a sight-seeing tour, jerk! How could I realize where it is? The scars from the tragedy of 9-11 were still much in evidence. No matter how far civilization likes to think it's progressed, we never escape the basic fact of war between human beings. All it takes is one collision, and bang... ...a gaping hole. Brilliant. Let's take a picture. Switch. Okay, cheese. One more. Thinking about it, I didn't know anyone. I had no acquaintances... nobody. How could I find her? Gangsta Peace Health Hey, gimmie the cash Japanese motherfucker! How much? Everything you got yen, pesos, lira, rubles, Amex, JCB. You fuckin' name it! Foodsnaps, nigger! It's cold out here! What a surprise. I thought everyone in New York was smiling and happy. I appear to be wrong. Shut the fuck up with your foreigh-assbullshit. Give us your money, before we stop be' in nice, you hear? Dispense the fuck'in cash, motherfucker! Pardon me? Jesus Christ!!! What a bag luck! Honey, New York's the safest city in the country now, and you manage to go and get yourself mugged. He said his name was Cassius. He was some kind of artist wih a taste for Japanese things. Why did you help me? I love Japanese man. C'mon honey-just once'll do. You mean... gay? Don't worry, you're not exactly my type. I have my preferences. Now, if you were Kimu Taku, I will be all over you. Somehow I had found a place to stay, But I wondered if this would turn out to be fortunate or not. Cassius was actually a priest Although one with a side line dealing marijuana. Thank you father for your prayers and your special gifts. The one thing about him that did actually seem like a priest... ...was that he treated poor people fairly. Okay, he didn't do it for free, but... God is stingy. God is netting you live, fuck off. Yo, what are you doing? Who is she? A girl by the name of Shizuru. Your girlfriend in Japan? No, she's in New York. Oh yeah? She's a hottie. Where does she live? Why don't you go see her? I don't know where she lives. New York's a big place. It can be hard to track someone down here. I know. That's why I'm making these. Is this where she lives? Yeah, I think so. The mystery... ...will be revealed. What? It'd be faster to run. Here it is. There's nothing here. 44 Magnum... This is... Over the rainbow, baby! Cassius... Smith and Wesson What? Take it. No, I don't know how to use it. Pull back the hammer, point, aim and fire. Remember this. If you kill someone, your life won't change that much. But if someone kills you... then it's all over. That's the way of the world, kid. Shizuru? Who are you? Police, help!! No, sightseeing! Her name was Aya. You came all this way... from Tokyo. Yeah. This is what she saw every day. She's been away for ages. For ages? At least two months. That's why I'm look ng after the place. Got to let the fresh air in. Someone told me she'd died. Died? I heard from her last week. Said she was shooting in Mexico. Mexico? That's what she said. You just missed each other. More importantly, look. What's that? She's three months behind on rent. She asked me to cover it... Typical Shizuru. Hey, Sekiguchi? It's me. Makoto. Can you lend me 400,000? The money will be in your account today. Sorry. I'd cover it if I could but... I'm only just paying for dance lessons. It's okay, she's an old friend. You take dance lessons? It's off-off Broadway. Call me when you get the money. Okay. See you. Shizuru? What's wrong? What are you doing? Cooking. You were here all along? Are you drunk? Today's quiz. Will 'Mayo-Noodles' pass the taste test? No way. And the correct answer is... Shizuru SATONAKA I was surprised when Miyuki told me you were in New York. You should've called then again, my phone's broken. Sorry about that. I'm in Mexico taking pictures for the exhibition. It's a last minute thing. No time to book a hotel. Since I'll be off the radar, I'll try to write. Could you do me a favor? Please reconfirm my gallery booking. Put down a deposit so they don't cancel. New York is a weird city. Downtown America suddenly transforming into somewhere like Hong Kong or Italy. Excuse me. If I might just trouble you do you know where a Mr. Convoy lives? Japanese friend? Looking for someone? Can I possibly reserve a space at an art gallery? Your English is so polite. Sounds crazy man. You looking for art gallery, cowboy? It's here. In a place like this? Yes. Die, you fucking spy. Spy? What do you mean? Someone tipped us off. What are you talking about? What a bad luck! Are you awake? Why are you here? I'm an Asian in New York... I hear stuff. Some Japanese guy marched in on the Chinese mafia, I figured it must've been you. They called you? Wipe you face. Convory came here after Tianamen Square. In exile? Illegally, of course. Living someone else's life with a fake i d. Are there many like that? All kinds of bugs in the Big Apple. Apparently Convoy's gallery doesn't exist. Convoy buys art... hangs it in an office. That's what they call Convoy's Gallery'. How come? Convoy's got a fantastic eye. All those chosen make it big. That guy who shot the Louis Vitton poster... The one who did the Underground CD jackets... Many famous people got their break there. The media's really into it. Dealers, everyone... they all want a piece. When Shizuru said she had a reservation... ...I'm afraid she was lying. Not open yet... What's this? It you're begging, clear out. I'm not begging. I'm waiting for someone. Who? A man called Convoy. Nobody is here. I know that. I'm waiting for him. You should hurry home. If someone puts the word out you're a terrorist. The cop will be here in minutes and you'll be deported. But I haven't done anything. That's just how this town is. It's a white man world And yellow and black folk are only stains on it. Do 'Stains' look this good? Did you take these? No. A friend of mine did. I'd like them to take picture for my funeral. Sure. I'll ask her. Okay. Follow me. Where to? My place. I told you the police will be here if you hang out much longer. You push it. Her name was Fah. Come on in. I'll make you some tea. It's fine Who is it? A guest for you, Convoy. A Woman. This is the person you've been looking for. Convoy. Convoy, I'm very pleased to meet you. Who are you? My name is Makoto Segawa. I'm here on behalf of Shizuru Staonaka. On behalf of? It's a favor. I was asked to reconfirm a booking at your gallery. I have brought cash. A thousand dollars. You're being tricked. I never rent out my gallery. I know nothing. I'm just fulfilling my promise to Shizuru. Take your pathetic bit of cash and fuck off. Or I'll call the police. If you're going to call them, call them. I'd love to see you dragged away with me. Then you're a dead man. Convoy, just take a look at the pictures. Mother, you're too soft. Mother? Two of them were pretty good. The one's my mother chose aren't too bad. The others are crap. I'm afraid that I can hardly show two photos in my office. That much you get, right? Don't worry. It's be fine. When she gets back there'll be lots of amazing pictures for your walls. What are you going to do if you don't have enough pictures? At least you thought of that before you came? I'll do whatever it takes. Great. I made those promises but I hadn't heard a single word from Shizuru. Crying is not going to help. Great view! This is what she must have seen. This was the New York Shizuru loved. And now I had glimpsed it... had begun to photograph it, too. The town Shizuru was watching Well, honey, long time no see. I figured you must be lying dead somewhere. Can I borrow this camera? Help yourself. They're only junk. ...Even better! Use this. This is a superb camera. It was just something I picked up. If you're going to shoot New York. Do me a favor and get it right. Make it look fabulous! Fall... Fall... Fall... What she saw and what I see, overlap. She and I, overlap. I miss her. It was from someone, I didn't know. I've wired the 300,000 for the deposit. So when you confirm it's been received, please get back to me. Is this a scam? It's an old Japanese trick. Talking about your dream and then hitting up some softie to send you money. Are you saying she was cheating on me? I'm saying, I don't think there was anyone... ...who actually made it over here to New York. What's that supposed to mean? Makoto. Just clam down. What do you know about her? Mind what you say or I'll kill you. Your English is getting more American every day. People really do change with time. I guess this town has an effect on everyone... understand? I was losing my way. I agonized as I was organizingmy photographs. Trying to put together all the different things I'd heard. The most logical thing seemed to be that Shizuru had changed. It sounded logical, but I couldn't figure it out. Maybe the Shizuru that I thought I knew wasn't the real Shizuru. Use this. It was just something I picked up. For Christ sakes! What's going on? Cassius, where did you find this camera? Calm down boy. Why do you want to know? This camera was hers. These are your photos. These are probably here photos. What about this one? Here it is. A friend in the police told me they found the body of a Japanese woman here. There was no one in Japan to claim the body so they put them in the morgue. Makoto This is where Shizuru died. Let's go. Shizuru... Let's get out of here! Come on! Come on! This ain't a robbery. Someone's trying to kill us! Do you think that's who killed Shizuru? Probably. That bastard... ...killed her. You bastard! Makoto! Stop! Makoto! Makoto! Makoto! You're gonna get yourself killed! Pull back the hammer, point, aim and fire. Oh, this is like a movie! Makoto! I gonna go get the police! Aya? Lucky man. You get to die on the same spot. You killed Shizuru? So what? It's no big deal. Just another bug in the Big Apple Getting big ideas about being a photographer. Aya Yes. There are great pictures. Thank you very much. No, not you. I'm talking about the pictures. Who took them? She just got lucky, that's all. You killed her for that? Because she had her dream come true? So you killed her? Dreams are best for bed. That's why I put her to sleep. An insect's little dream. I squished it between my fingers. Just like your beloved Shizuru... ...I'll put a hole in your head. Shoot if you must. You'll blow your own arm off, too. Shoot if you must. You'll blow your own arm off, too. What are you doing? Fuck you! Doesn't it feel good to be alive?! Give it to me, baby! Give it to me, baby! Shizuru. Cassius' words came back to me... Killing someone doesn't bring about that big a change in your own life. But if someone kills you... ...then it's the end of everything. It really does end. I'm alive? You awake? How come I'm still alive? It was Shizuru. She protected you. What about Aya? She's in hospital? Unfortunately it looks like she'll live. I guess that letter you received from Shizuru was her work. In her apartment they discovered copies of letters she had sent to Shizuru's friends and bank transfer details. What happened to Shizuru? Do you wanna go see her? Since she'd been shot in the face I didn't know if it was her or not. Buy tangerines. When you die, it's all over. Everything is finished. With Shizuru dead I wanted to get away from New York as quickly as I could. My last look at New York. What were you doing? What do you mean? How long were you going to keep me waiting? Keep you waiting? You've forgotten our promise to meet up when you turn pro? No, I haven't. Are you sure? Of course not. I wonder... What? You blame me? Yes, for making me wait. I'm sorry. Naughty boy. I'm a naughty boy. A naughty boy and a jerk. A naughty boy and a jerk. A naughty boy, a jerk, boring, a bully, lazy, over-sexed with smelly feet. A naughty boy, a jerk... Enough. Anyway, I'm sorry. Apologize properly. Sorry to make you wait? I apologize. I'm sorry I made you wait. Okay. What? It's okay. I'm over it. Thank you... for believing in me. That goes without saying. Idiot. It's not ripe. You're right. Let me make up for it. What? Shizuru was definitely there. Even if there's not a single person in the whole world who would believe me ...that I met her again. Excuse... pardon me, are you Shizuru-san? What? Excuse me. I represent a German company that designs CD jackets. I heard about you from Cassius. Cassius? I really liked your work when I saw it in Convoy's gallery. Convoy's gallery? She is exhibiting many of your wonderful photographs. Many photographer's agents are looking for you. I've been looking all over for you. You're Shizuru-Satonaka, right? No, Shizuru is... Shizuru's pictures? That's when I decided... ...to walk in step with Shizuru, the rest of my life. Yes, it's my picture. Now I'm a budding pro photographer. And Cassius is my agent. I have finally settled a deal with an advertisement firm. Every time I peer into the viewfinder, I pray that I'll see Shizuru. Every day I go to work handing out cards with her name on. One more shot for me.
