Though diabetes is a hereditary condition Our diet, lifestyle, mental stress ...are reasons for diabetes too Diabetes can be controlled with a set way of life Right in the beginning Otherwise patient has to resort to tablets and insulin This treatment is very expensive Many poor people are suffering unable to afford insulin In fact some of them are not even aware they are diabetic Some even die Is there no medicine to cure the patient from this condition? 'Sugar level was too high My leg was amputated, sir' 'I am unable to move my limbs' 'Both my parents suffer from diabetes' 'We have to come once a week for dialysis for my mother-in-law' 'Dialysis is as terrible as suffering in hell' 'We are not blessed with children because he's diabetic for many years' 'New born baby has been diagnosed with diabetes' 'All the children gathered here suffer from juvenile diabetes' 'Lifelong dependent on medicine' 'My mother died without even telling any of us she was diabetic' 'I've lost 1 kidney' 'My wife lost her eyesight totally' 'I've lost my aim and ambition' 'Doctors say my 2nd kidney has been affected too' 'This is a sweet suicide!' I came back to my roots wanting to serve my people But I was confused as to how I can serve them The loss of my dear friend has shaken me up completely Now it has triggered a clarity in my thought process If a person is diagnosed with diabetes He or she is stuck with tablets, insulin, dialysis They have to be resigned to being treated lifelong We have to manage and live with diabetes Diabetes should be cured with just one drug I intend discovering one such magic drug 'I will use my education, knowledge, perseverance, proficiency' 'And find that magic cure' That is my first duty to my people and this world Very good, Saravana The world will celebrate you as the son of this soil You will achieve your goal for sure Your determination and self confidence will definitely make your dream come true Go ahead, Saravana "Eureka! Yeah, let us push it higher" "Right now, you can light the fire" "Move on, yeah We can reach together, Astro" "Turn it up, now Yeah, this is our future" "Let's go, yeah, we should never tire" "Stand up, you can go inspire, Maestro" "Break it down" "Sleepless nights" "Time to rise" "Eureka! Yeah, let us push it higher" "Right now, you can light the fire" "Move on, yeah We can reach together, Astro" "Turn it up, now Yeah, this is our future" "Let's go, yeah, we should never tire" "Stand up, you can go inspire, Maestro" Turn...turn Don't look here - Okay...okay - Close your eyes My eyes are shut tight Don't look at me Okay, dear I can't look at you, huh? First fix my hook Are you ordering me?! Okay...okay - Listen, dear - What? Nothing to worry Do you want pretty ducklings? Why would I need ducks? We have ducks all around our bungalow anyway Or...um...do you want A little scientist? I am myself a well-known scientist Why would you need another scientist? Hey! You are such a dumb head! Hey! I want 1...2 No, 3...4 5 ducklings 5 baby scientists I want 10 altogether, okay? Fat hopes! Tastes good but don't know what I'm drinking - Boss - Hey! You? - How did you land here? - Boss I'm your ALA, boss Sounds like MLA? Assistant to Lab Assistant I'm myself an assistant How can I have an assistant? Yes, boss, please assign some work for me What have you studied? I read 'Kumudham' just now I have 'Ananda Vikatan' to finish You have an overdose of SK! What is SK, boss? K is 'kozhuppu' means excess temerity - S is- - I got it, boss Let's go Boss, give me some work to do - Feed the rats to the left thrice a day - Okay, boss Feed the rats on the right 6 times a day a day Why 'day-day'? Today and everyday You're playing with words like a Scrabble expert! But is it my job only to feed them? No, the rats will pee You have to collect that too How will I know which rat wants to pee when, boss? Watch your watch When they pee, catch it Boss, you are an avatar of Thomas Alva Edison! 'Thangam' What is this, man? [Malayalam] Why are you giving my work to that man? Don't you realize this is a very important job? - I do - So just feed the rats Understood? I understood good Are you from Palakkad? Bingo! And you? Graveyard, right? Kerala border Marthandam I know to speak a little bit in Malayalam What is your name? Tattered 'jatti' No, Krishna Kutty [Malayalam] I don't feel comfortable here I would prefer to meet you in my room We can chat freely I have some work to do See you, I'll be back I saw your back! 'Idli' cooker! Show me your face What is this? Your face is like a Sangam age urn unearthed in Keezhadi How did that damsel flip for this? We are both Malayalis from Kerala Don't make me a murderer! Tell me the truth A priest in Kerala gave me an amulet I've tied it around my waist That charm is working, boss - Will you get me an amulet too? - Of course I will - What is the name of that seer? - Kunjuni His name sucks! Ask that man to change his name legally I can't stand that name! Makes my skin crawl 'Thangam' Me...? Of course you Boss, she is calling you to her room Come, dear Go, my dear! O' my darling! Hereafter my Chief Minister is Pinarayi Vijayan My director is Gautham Menon My hero is Mohan Lal But my heroine ...is NOT Nithya Menen Not Lakshmi Menon Sundari Menon You my beauty is my heroine He's always in the lab day and night tied to his research He doesn't get enough sleep Neither does he eat properly Yes, doctor, he doesn't allow us to eat or sleep either! Saravanan is always like that If he takes up a responsibility ...till he completes it he'll forget the world We all know Genetic modification engineering is his home ground It's a cake walk for him! Yes, sir If we modify PG-2 protein found in fat tissues I feel diabetes can be controlled, sir Diabetes isn't a single gene Because it is a polygene it is slightly complicated 'I have faith in my work' - I will get the breakthrough - You will! When doctors were prescribing diabetic patients to eat 6 meals a day You asserted diabetes can be controlled with 3 meals a day You were the 1st to present such a paper The whole world accepted it I'm very proud about it Doctor? Oh my! This is taking me years back Isn't this... ...sweet pretzels? Yes, doctor Akka I love these native snacks Gentlemen, the reason insulin is being supplied worldwide without a hitch We have neatly divided it territory wise amongst ourselves And we do our business with due diligence Even if Asian territory was exclusively marked for me When I was asked to part with China I gave it up for Mr Chang with utmost magnanimity [Ukrainian] After these too [Ukrainian] Your OJO laboratory is the biggest one You are the best! That isn't the point now Messing up my business Some bad elements are conspiring to snatch Middle East from me I won't sit quiet twiddling my thumbs! You got it? [Russian] We won't allow it We are happy with this assurance That's always there, VJ [Russian] Joke of the day He invents a cure for diabetes? Look at this Hear the name He is from your country So what if he comes? When he struggles to the top and raises his head We'll tap at the right spots to knock him down Hey! Come back...come back Scientist Saravanan His meddling hammer Nailed me in my coffin and took years for me to hold my head high again Antibiotic Requirement Test Using this concept We can find out the dosage of antibiotics a patient needs Precisely So consumption of antibiotics plummeted drastically Antibiotics manufactured by OJO Laboratories Tonnes of it was wasted and had to be trashed Therefore we suffered a loss of $ 6000 million Thanks to this insulin business that is keeping us afloat After tumbling and stumbling, OJO holds its head high today I won't be surprised if we face danger for this too thanks to Saravanan! Doctor...doctor We got the lab report Everything is positive We have got this report as per our expectations, sir This report is positive too, sir [Malayalam] Sir, this result is consistent Wow! 'We can't brush him off as ordinary' Saravanan The most dangerous scientist Yes, our efforts have borne fruit Keep an eye on this chap Keep an eye without fail Unblinkingly The medicine is working now Stage 1 is a success Yes! Congrats, sir - 'Tell me, Gopi' - News from Saravanan's lab, chief He has made a breakthrough in his research on diabetes it seems He has succeeded in his test on animals Isn't his elder brother Pugazhendhi your classmate? Go and pay him a courtesy call Hi Pugazhendhi My dear sweet idiot! What a surprise! What brings you here? All due to my concern for your brother What does that mean? A few people hate the fact he is succeeding in his new research Stop it, my friend Ask him to stop his research Why should we invite unnecessary trouble? Is this some kind of joke? Do you know his research will be acclaimed as a global achievement? Is global recognition important to you? Or is staying alive your priority? I swear I'll- Saravana, what is this? What, I say? Trying to threaten me? 'What is the use of getting angry with me?' Do you have any idea the kind of medical mafia that is active behind this? Cash in billions has been invested in this If you put a spoke in his wheel will he let you off so easily? Don't forget there is political influence too I am just a messenger - After that- - Hey! Gopi Tell the one who sent you here My brother is not a single man He has an army behind him We will sacrifice our lives If need be we will take others' lives too You can prevent him in any which way you like My brother will see this research to its successful end You happen to be a friend Just turn and go back - Go - Cool...cool! Fate doesn't spare anyone "Saravana's fireworks skyrocket fast" "You become his feast" "Like cotton candy pace, his punch is a blast" "Hip-hop base Don't come close" "The legend will now take a class" "Smashing times ahead, let's go" "Into the arena steps a new don He's the king to reckon from now on" "Our master is here to defeat you Try and make your fist speak, dude" "For a face off now and here who has the guts without fear?" "He'll make you scream & scatter Make you panic, run helter-skelter" "Blast" "Roast" "Feast" "Kick-ass, buddy" "Blast" "Roast" "Feast" "Are you ready, buddy?" "Blast" "Roast" "Feast" "Kick-ass, buddy" We anticipated this antagonism But I didn't expect them to send thugs to attack us like this No footage has been recorded in any CCTV in our college This has been well planned I know some people are against my research, pa But I didn't expect them to play dirty like this That's why I kept the progress of my research under wraps But Mr Desikan impulsively announced it to international media This is the reaction to his announcement We have no choice, pa We have to face these reactions 'After our temple festival I'll talk to the Center in Delhi' 'Doesn't matter about the expense' This year, we should celebrate the temple festival in style - Yes, sir - Not only that, my brother is here It has to be splendorous We perform these prayers to ensure our people enjoy the celebrations Whatever our people wish for let us fulfil them with pomp and splendor Sir...my lord! Our Kumudha from Thiruvarur is floating on a dream cloud thinking of you 'Our master who went abroad has returned, my dear' 'Will he dance with you?' 'Or make you dance to his tunes?' Let's see Hey!

Don't compel me Every minute I am here Memories of my daughter keep flooding my mind I don't know how to thank all of you From the day Thulasi became my wife I think of you as my own father But you don't seem to share the same kinship If you think of me as your son Please go inside now Lord Muruga My dear...dear son The good Lord has tested our faith in Him Why are you teary eyed now? Grandma Random people occupy space here and live comfortably in this house Poor man, he's a man of simple needs I was worried he may leave us Thank God, Saravanan persuaded him Come, Saravana Appa I want to go on a holiday for a few weeks I can only see Thulasi all the time and all over this place 'I need some change, pa' I understand, my son You need this time off Good idea, Saravana Time is a good healer Look at God's screenplay! When we have a peg or two ice cubes will be missing There is ice all around us, 360 degrees But booze is missing Why aren't you letting me drink? The task we came here for - Isn't done yet - What 'task'? Send me in a passenger flight Don't send me as a corpse by cargo Spell it out in a simple way so I can understand We have come in search of him Who is he? His name is Munna He's a professional killer He can kill anyone anywhere all over the world with a fool-proof plan He is in this city now What is the link between a scientist and this gangster? He is the culprit who killed my wife - 'Yes, Munna' - I have a happy news for you, VJ Share the news I'll decide if it is happy or otherwise That scientist has come in search of us to our own den I'll reduce him to ashes and mix it in the river You mean Saravanan?

You were innocent in your approach But he walked away in a huff He isn't such a serious type for you to worry about him Meet him in August You'll be flabbergasted by his act His heart is scarred now I am well aware of his loss "Words of love to me you whispered lovingly" "This left-behind heart of your lover is searching for you all over" "Do not lose control Don't lose hope, my soul" "Glided into my life on a full moon night" "You stood as far away as a star in sight" "I stood here on the ground Daily longing for you all alone" "Will I get a girl like you in my life who is world's best wife?"

You can hit me till your hands ache You won't get a single word from me Did you think he was a novice scientist playing with a pipette and a burette? I swear I will- He will tell us I'll make him tell us - Come - Coming Saravana To lose control of your senses in any predicament ...is not a wise man's virtue, Saravana To act rashly on impulse or to take revenge Ordinary men react this way You came here on an impulse The man you wanted to hunt down is dead too No point in prolonging your stay here Sir, Munna is just a weapon There must be a don above him, right? Shouldn't we know our enemy? What will you do with that knowledge? It's a very big network International medical mafia 'It's a chain link that's never ending' Whom will you take revenge on? How many will you kill? An ordinary person cannot destroy this network Only an avatar can help! I will, sir I will transform into that avatar In this avatar My intelligence is my weapon The success in my research ...will be the worst punishment I'll mete out to my enemies Good, Saravana I expected this from you That's the spirit I've set up a modern lab in Chennai for your use I would like to work as your assistant in your research, sir Please...please...please 'Congratulations, Saravana' - I wish you all the best - Thank you, sir Revelry is bubbling over like a beer bottle shaken up, boss - Our next research- - 'Good morning, doctor' Hi, VJ What a surprise! - Vanakkam - Good morning Congratulations I'm here as an uninvited guest It's a significant inauguration - Shouldn't you make it a grand affair? - What is the need to do so, Mr VJ? I am just a common man I'll just continue my research based on my education, that's all If you come into the limelight with your scientific research, social service Looks like you can't experience your sorrow in solitude Mr VJ Is this a left handed compliment or- 1 second Provocation is also a kind of encouragement I heard you went up to the Himalayas looking for your enemy? We can detect the enemy in front of us, in the blink of an eye The enemy behind our back If not today, I can identify him tomorrow But a coward of an enemy who sends a messenger We have to go on a witch-hunt Does 'forget and forgive' hold good in this instance? Pain isn't only if you hold your enemy by the cuff of his neck and hit him I know now where to hit for the pain to skyrocket! He said this man is a scientist His punches are flying in mid-air like WWF! So you are ready for a face-off! This blow of mine now ...will be a dead-ly one! After that, my enemy can never get up on his feet - 'Madhu? - Sir' - 'You have to receive Dr Venu Pappu - Sure, sir' Who is our guest? Scientist, Professor Dr Venu Pappu He's a great scholar We haven't met him But we have read a lot about him He has visited every city on earth He has lectured in every university in the world In short, he is a 5L Johnny Walker! He has reached our floor Welcome, sir It's a pleasure to have you Thank you 'She is the right Miss Right for me' Pah! She beats a pure bred horse hollow! 'I must dance with her to my favorite 'Arabic Kuthu' song' All white coats come forward How come, they are so nimble on their toes? Looks like they've passed 'NEET' exam! 'Let me wave my magic wand' My name is Dada Pet name, Animal supplier Dada Look, girl I have a steady supply of species from cockroaches to wild buffaloes They sleep only beside me From earthworms to exotic snakes Even mosquitoes that die when swatted I have all living beings which have 5 senses But 1 condition Either unique or almost extinct animals and those barred by the Govt ...will never be supplied by the office of Dada - Even for a million or more - No! If you are okay with this condition my supplies are in my van parked outside I'll release them in a jiffy What do you say, sweetie? Madhu, who is this? Where is Dr Venu Pappu? You 'Dangamari'!! 'I am not worthy of all this' Why the hell didn't you tell us? Did you give me a chance? You were staring starry eyed at me We can chat in the canteen, go Hmmm...go - Dada - 'Sir?' - I like you, da - 'Same to you, sir' You and your company are as important as my entire team here, for my research You are part of my team from today Sir, I'm just a photocopy You are always the original, sir Then, dude, is our party a pool party or tan-party? I haven't killed anyone so far Don't go to that extent, sir I'll get the animals ready for you 'I didn't see you coming, sir' Sorry, sir Insult! I never anticipated such an insult 'I didn't anticipate your arrival either, sir' My fault to have signed this assignment! Is this how you treat a senior scientist? Climbing up and down 4 floors I'm sweating, my knees are trembling Sorry, sir Unexpected mistake on our part We were waiting to receive you Please welcome, sir 'She's rushing to butter you up!' I'm extremely sorry, sir Please accept our apology I take the blame for this 100% He is cool now like a hand inside an insulated icebox Sir has cooled down So go back to your work of poking upturned frogs! 'Research is not child's play' Research needs plenty of brain power Intense research like this on diabetes Not as easy as eating a slice of papaya! This is pancreas It is a small appendage behind our stomach in the left abdomen It consists of 2 parts Head on one side and tail on the other It is the same coin Here the stomach empties partially digested food into the intestine We are interested in the tail part Only in the tail is the duct secreting the insulin we need On this pear shaped pancreas are a cluster of cells They produce and secrete hormones These cells are called Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta We need to focus on Beta cells They secrete insulin Only when an issue arises here diabetes pops up its head Beta cells are produced 8-10 days after a baby is born 'When the mother stops breastfeeding' '...beta cells stop growing' 'In the case of babies breast-fed for a longer time' 'Chances of being diabetic are very slim' Our research is to change alpha cells into beta cells Reprogramming from the beginning So if beta cells are increased More beta cells more insulin No diabetes That's right Dada, what is this? Sorry, sir, to think this face deserves these coolers! This will suit you perfectly Why, sir? - Not looking good, no? - You are Mr Handsome - Me? - Yes Complexion or features are not important Your true beauty lies in your pure golden heart You are a true legend, sir I'll keep it, thank you Sir, there is no side effects We have crossed the lab test and animal test successfully - 'Feels good to hear this, Saravana' - Thank you, sir 'What are we waiting for?' 'Let's move to the next stage' Next stage is human test We need a volunteer 'So we need a chronic diabetic patient' - 'Right?' - Yes, sir Where will I find a volunteer now? The risk is high in this test Agency slammed the door on our face Everyone is running helter-skelter Hey 'butter' Solo-cribbing session?

My God! Are you okay, sir? Our drug is the right cure for diabetes We were successful with Phase 1, Phase 2 No side effects even in animal test 'What? Injection for animals?' Hey! Flour-face!

My sister is traumatized Pelt them with stones Hey! No...no...no Don't hit us We are scientists 'Scientist...my foot! Use this slipper on him!' 'Scientist Saravanan's research has taken a backseat' 'Business tycoon Vasanthan Perumal has slipped into coma' 'Medical council has sent a notice asking for explanation' I am positive my drug wouldn't have caused this I sense some conspiracy behind this No one has understood you We can't blame them Their anger is justified Loyal employees of any boss are bound to react like this What are the two up to all alone in there? 'What joke would he have cracked?' - 1 + 1 = ? - 11 Did I ask you to solve a sum? 'Look what they are up to' They are busy kissing passionately Why are you excited?

I didn't say so Give him a good thrashing He has been torturrrring us 'Brainless bozo! Why are you hitting me?' Dr Saravanan, would you like to say anything? I don't have anything to add at this juncture We haven't got the biopsy report When we get it ...we'll know the reason behind Vasanthan Perumal's comatose state The whole world is now ridiculing Indian scientists Press and Media are having the time of their lives deriding us We can zip all lips if we announce a ban on Dr Saravanan's research We can't accept this decision suggested by the Council With 100% cooperation from the patient and written permission from his family We carried out this human test Claiming to cure diabetes you dangled a carrot and killed the horse! No...no...no 'You shouldn't insult him like this' This is a council of literates Dr Saravanan is a renowned world famous scientist He has a 100% success rate in all his research so far To comment in a demeaning way of his dedication to science I cannot accept it When we have adhered to legal procedures You can't control his work by suggesting a ban on his research Okay, Venu Pappu We won't ban his research But in order to complete this research We need a volunteer for human testing who will trust him 100%, right? Who will come forward? I'll volunteer, sir He means the world to us He is our beacon of faith 1000s of people Are willing to give, not just their body, but their life, for his research If they can't be used to protect his dignity What use is our body and breath? Uncle, I'm ready Me too My strength is the faith they have placed in my labor of love That unshakable faith will never be a wasted effort I am a law abiding citizen I will never violate our laws When my research bears the fruit of success The world and our people will realize the truth and integrity behind my work 'This isn't self glorification' It is for mankind My humble request to this Medical Council Give me another chance I have signed for various reasons on a daily basis I consider it an honor to sign my permission for your research God help me You'll be alright Don't worry - Saravanan - Yes, doctor You see, according to the reports She's significantly improving That's great Rapid improvement is evident in our patient 'Dosage of tablets can be reduced from twice a day to once a day' Please eat That's all, huh? Only 2 tablets for the whole day He is Vasanthan Perumal's brother-in-law The black sheep Now it falls in place Bro...? I'm bored of being 'benami' to my brother-in-law When will my sister's husband die? When can we enjoy life to the fullest, huh? That's why, we put a spoke in his wheel! We poked my brother-in-law's eyes using scientist Saravanan's own hand! Minor task, major happiness Celebrate your victory, scientist I'm scared to stay even in 5 star hotels They fix cameras even in the loo Are we safe here?

Hereafter you will be living in a separate island With maximum facilities and worldly comfort Like a king ruling his kingdom I didn't get into this for name, fame or my comfort & conveniences I started my research on this wholeheartedly believing my theory I was successful in finding this drug all because of God's Grace Drug? Money, Saravanan Solid cash Not just breaking the ceiling of your fancy bungalow Money will fall in your lap from the heavens Dollars, Euros, Pounds Rial, Dinar, etc etc Money from whichever part of the world will be piling at our feet Am I right? Of course! We market even the most mediocre drugs with expertise and ease If we get all this, it's a real treat Like 'halwa' from Tirunelveli - How will we let go, boss? - Come, Saravanan Outright purchase or partnership I'm fine with either deal We can market this miracle cure to the entire world You're asking this without knowing the background of our boss, VJ He's born with a golden spoon He won't flip for money or your lucrative offer Sorry, Mr VJ You and I are poles apart in our basic intention So many people are suffering from diabetes here They can't afford to buy medicine Each day is a struggle in their lives I want my drug to be of use to such underprivileged people They should enjoy a disease free prosperous life You are a genius! Golden heart Lofty ideals! Saravanan, you're really great! But this nation does not celebrate intellectuals like you You only come across pollution Traffic Crowd...noise Do you want to live in this turmoil as one in a million? Saravanan, this is how our nation will treat you This is my motherland My people Every single person living here is part of my family My joy is in co-existing with them The defects you pointed out will change in the course of time We deserve to lead a better life - Am I right? - Right...right! Every alternate sentence you speak You are asking if it is right, Mr VJ Your mind set is wrong Your planning...wrong Your desire Your avarice...wrong You are totally wrong! 'Hey Saravana!' I'm telling you like teaching a pet parrot What is in your mind? Tell me Not now, I am always of the same mind set I will make this drug a national property I want to distribute it free of cost to the poor and needy That's my boy! This is...my Saravanan Sir...surprise! Welcome, sir Extremely proud of you Thank you, sir Saravanan is priceless! How did you think you could fix a price to his head, VJ? You are a FOOL! Love, affection, kinship, friendship This is Saravanan's world Tree snake...bronzeback tree snake has conquered the peak of intrigue Your world now Lies at our feet Saravana I have gone old You came from some remote village At so young an age You accomplished this extraordinary feat The whole village has placed you on a pedestal But you made me one of your lackeys! Don't you feel sorry for me, Saravana? I guided you like my own son What am I asking in return? Give me the formula you discovered so I can earn name and fame I'll feel proud announcing to the world that I discovered it, right? That's all I'm asking, Saravana I don't want these insignificant titles of doctor, guide, researcher 'No need at all' I need intoxication Getting high, drunk on fame The great contribution for the mankind From the great scientist Desikan That's all, Saravanan 'What else I want?' Sir Do you realize, sir? Even now I refer to you as 'sir' Supposing you had asked me this yesterday I would have given it to you wholeheartedly But now you have revealed your true colors to me Every nerve and sinew in your body has turned into poison I considered you as a family member More than my father, I regarded you as my guru and my mentor But you have turned into a traitor and stabbed me on my back, sir Even if I forgive you for this Tomorrow this world will punish me too for the crime of forgiving you! Someone like you, sir You don't deserve to be called 'sir' Even the shadow of a traitor like you is not qualified to fall on me As long as I live You are a despicable human being I don't wish to set my eyes on You are my foot! Saravana sir? How did you come here, sir? - Dada?! - I feel terrible seeing you here What are you doing here? Don't ask me, sir I wanted a lift to Pallavaram Scumbags! Brought me here Are you serious? Something sinister here People, rich and poor are imprisoned here and they inject some medicine to kill them - They are testing illegally? - Come I don't swallow the tablets I hide them in my pocket Come Tiffin time They eat for 1 whole hour, sir Let's sneak in before that somehow Come He is good at sleepwalking! Come...come on Good morning Look, he didn't even reply! This side, sir, 4 of them will be seated around a CCTV screen They won't look at the footage They will be looking at reels [overlap of voices] Look at all of us, sir 1 second, sir Look over there My dear Thulasi Ye...yes Thulasi? Please show your child to our master Yes We have a son His name is Velan He is just like you Little scientist - Where? - Vela? - Vela? - 'Vela?' 'Vela...?' Did you see Velan? Vela? Hey! Go and look for him He may be out somewhere 'Where are you?' [siren blaring] [overlap of voices admonishing] Hello Mr Scientist Is this your lab, huh? To take your wife back home as soon as you reunited with her? 'This is our area, our lab' I don't wish to beat around the bush Let me come to the point You know the diabetic drug you have discovered We want it in our hands People will have access to it just as you wanted But It costs money 'That's all' Your drug cured diabetes 100% All the medical suppliers in the market who have been selling drugs for diabetes ...will automatically disappear the moment we set foot in the same arena Give it, sir Otherwise our OJO company will be the first to vanish into thin air The entire production of J Formula will be carried out ...only in our manufacturing unit As if we will consume the medicine we manufacture here It will reach the people just as Saravanan wanted The production cost will only be Rs 50 We will sell it for Rs 5000, Rs 50,000 You can even add a couple more zeroes! We will be world's #1 millionaire within 24 hours you know I didn't find this medicine for it to be converted into cash This tablet should reach every diabetic patient free of cost What a noble thought! He is spinning a yarn skyscraper-high! I will not allow anyone to make a fast buck in between I will dedicate this labor of love only for my countrymen Do you know the situation you are in right now, Saravanan? Cowards! What can you do to me? I am willing to sacrifice even my life to my people and my country Bingo! The pain of losing money cannot be felt by a rich scientist like you, Saravanan sir Madhu...?! Madhu This scientist is going quack-quack about his homeland Like these quacks selling home remedies Speak up, Madhu If you give the green signal we can start the next treatment Madam, just signal with your eyes I'll make him cough up the formula with a few stinging blows from me Saravanan sir You should know my full story You are responsible for my father's death The reason I am standing in this state now It's because of you My father was Asia's #1 pharmaceutical king His empire was razed to the ground because of your damn research Do you expect me to zip my lips and watch you doling out free medicine? What is this, Madhu? Are you one of them too? Not also-ran! I run this operation Only me 'The day you discovered Antibiotic Requirement Test' 'The day our OJO Laboratories sunk to depths of despair' 'Appa...?' Dad...? My elder brother has taught me the ropes of the game No banyan tree can perish without sprouting its aerial roots! I am there for you When you started your research on finding a cure for diabetes As a student in a way I felt happy But as the heiress to OJO Laboratories 'I couldn't stomach it' We tried so hard to stop your success in your research But with your continuous passion and perseverance ...you were hell bent in winning against all odds That's when we changed our game-plan Human brain doesn't work when we panic and we are flustered Instead of this growing fear our insulin business will be wiped out Let us make Saravanan find a cure for diabetes What if OJO Laboratories manufactures and sells it? Ahaa! This is melody to our ears Of course But how is that feasible? He bounces back after every attack! Let's change our strategy I'll be the new weapon in his game - Madhu - Wait Untie me The reason OJO is able to hold its head high today My uncle VJ Desikan uncle is my dad's best friend Many a time I've been spellbound by your intelligence, aptitude and talent In fact I almost fell in love with you Nonsense! All the activities of your company are illegal You've changed this life-saving noble industry ...into a life-taking lifeless industry You catch hold of a man and make him prey to a disease Then you administer a cure and test if it is working effectively or not You sell it and mint money Is this your profession? Is this your dream? Is it your mission in life? There are diagnostic centers in every road in every town Multi specialty hospitals in every nook and corner One in 4 shops is a medical store Is this a land for humans to inhabit? Or a place for patients to suffer? The main culprit is medical mafia like you You have destroyed so many innocent lives for you to prosper with ill-gotten gains You are answerable to all this Stop it! 'Amma' Saravana, your little scientist He is cute indeed 'Amma' Hand over your formula Baby scientist will be alive and grow up ...to find the cure for the next disease, right? Vela...? 'Amma' Velan Velan is my heir Lion cub I'm not a scientist now I am a father, man Oh gawd!
