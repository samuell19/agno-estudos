Ooh! (GIGGLING) (SNIFFS) Ah! (BIRDS TWEETING) NARRATOR: You know that spring is here when the leaves start growing on trees. The sun feels warmer. (EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY) (CHITTERING) (INHALES) And a little monkey dances on his balcony at sunrise. (GIBBERING) (CHUCKLES) I think you have spring fever, George. Huh? Well, you're excited because spring is here. Ooh? Um, what's spring? Ah, you know what? Let's get outside and I'll show you. Uh-huh! And where are you boys headed on this beautiful day? I'm taking George to the park to explain spring. I can explain it right here. Spring is one of the four seasons. Remember summer? NARRATOR: George remembered summer. Ah! NARRATOR: And Hundley did too. (GROANS) Then came fall. Remember? Uh-huh. (GROANS) Whoo-hoo! (LAUGHS) Then it was winter. (GIGGLES) (GROANS) Well, now it's spring! Does that explain it for you, George? Uh-uh. Oh. Well, I guess the best way to learn is experience. See you soon. Enjoy the park! Ah! (GRUNTS) Oh... (CHITTERS) NARRATOR: Hundley already knew what spring meant. Some new mess George hadn't learned how to make yet. Can you see the changes that tell you it's spring? (GIBBERING) See, all around it's green and warm! (GEORGE CHITTERS) (CHUCKLES) Oh! (SNIFFS) MAN: (SINGING) The ice and snow have gone away The sun stays longer every day You don't need your coat, just a T-shirt and jeans The trees get leaves and the grass turns green Because spring brings things that make me sing The snow clouds run and hide Yeah, because spring brings things that make me sing I've got to get outside Let's get outside Now, the view outside was white and brown But things are changing all around You see the butterflies putting on a show Were caterpillars just a week ago And see, in spring you'll see the buzzing bees And squirrels and birds up in the trees And if you look real hard and your luck comes through You just might see a monkey, too Because spring brings things that make me sing The snow clouds run and hide Yeah, because spring brings things that make me sing I've got to get outside Let's get outside Let's get outside Let's get outside Do you have spring fever? Betsy thinks that's why you're running around by yourself being crazy. Oh, I'm not by myself. I'm with George. Geor... Well, he was right, uh, here. It's okay. There's no law against being crazy without a monkey. Aunt Margret always says, "You're having fun, that's what counts." (CHUCKLES) Yeah. If you're looking for Charkie, she ran that way. Thanks! Charkie! Happy spring fever! Oh... Ooh! (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) Hey, can you believe all the new spring things, George? Yeah! NARRATOR: All the way home, George couldn't stop thinking about taking Hundley to the park. He didn't want his best dog friend to miss all the fun. (GEORGE CHATTERING) (CHUCKLES) I've never seen you guys playing in the lobby before. Spring fever? Huh? That's when spring comes and all you want to do is play. (CHITTERING) NARRATOR: Hundley would never allow himself to have spring fever. (WHIMPERS) That's undignified. We're not playing. We're polishing the railings. Faster, Hundley. (LAUGHING) We want to win the Mayor's Spring Cleaning Prize, for the springiest, cleaniest building. And we have some stiff competition from Lydia, across the alley. Come on, I'll show ya. (BEEPING) (GASPS) Oh! Hi, hi, there! Hi! Oh. You're cleaning with simple rags and mops. Don't you want to win? Wow. Lydia's got some ultramodern equipment. (GIBBERS AGREEMENT) Technology is no match for a doorman with a plan and a dachshund... I hope. We better work extra hard to be extra clean, Hundley. (BARKS GRUFFLY) (SIGHS) You've been working hard, Hundley. Take a break. NARRATOR: Hundley spent a long time looking at ankles. That's why he liked the roof. Standing up here was like being the tallest dog in the world. (CHITTERS) Hiya, George! George hoped, now that Hundley was finished cleaning... (CHITTERING) ...he'd want to go to the park. (BARKS GRUFFLY) Aw! Hundley isn't interested in anything else until we win that spring cleaning prize. (GROANS) NARRATOR: Cleaning this whole building would take a long time. (GASPS) Ah! NARRATOR: But maybe Hundley could go to the park sooner if George helped with the cleaning! Huh... Now, where could a cleaning monkey do the most good? Hmm... Oh... NARRATOR: Not all questions are hard to answer. (GEORGE COUGHING) (CHUCKLES) Ah! NARRATOR: The Doorman and Hundley were sure gonna be surprised when they saw what a monkey could do. (DOOR CLOSES) Now, let's get to work on the basement. (BARKS) Oh, gee, that's not right. (BARKING) (SIRENS WAILING) (SIGHS IN RELIEF) That's not smoke. That's steam. Yeah. I have a building full of steam. Can you do anything? Why don't we get any normal calls? Do we even do steam? Who does steam? (MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING) Relax, everyone. I'm a plumber. I do steam. He must've been trying to steam clean the entire place. (CHUCKLES) He is so competitive. (MEOWS) This broom fell against the handle. (GASPS) George, you did it? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) You deserve a thank you, George. Huh? Steam blasted the dirt away and uncovered some bad pipes. They need to be replaced from here all the way to the roof. That'll make a mess! Can't it wait till after the contest? I take it that's a no? I have to turn off all the water. (GRUNTS) Yep, everyone has to get out of the building for a few days. (DINGS) Hope to see you later. Bye, Hundley. Bye-bye now. (COOING) (CHITTERS) It's lucky everyone could find places to stay on such short notice. Almost everyone. I can't find anywhere that will allow D-A-C-H-S-H-U-N-D-S. D-A-C-S... Wait, what? D-O-G-S. Huh? I can't find anywhere for Hundley. Oh... Hey! (CHITTERING) Hey, yeah! Hundley can come with us to the country house. We have plenty of room. How would you like to go to the country for a few days with your buddy George? (CHITTERING) But I have to stick around here. You'll be going without me. (WHIMPERS) DOORMAN: Don't forget Hundley's pillow. I promise I'll bring you home as soon as the pipe's fixed. (GRUMBLES) Then we'll have time to clean up and win that contest! (GEORGE GIBBERS) (HUNDLEY BARKS) I hope. Whoa. That shouldn't happen. This job may be bigger than I thought. Uh... By bigger, you mean take longer? (GROANS) Hmm. NARRATOR: The only thing George knew that was powerful enough to cheer up someone that sad was spring fever. Aha! NARRATOR: Of course! If George taught him to love spring, Hundley would catch spring fever and be happy. (CHITTERING) George was going to make this a trip Hundley would never forget. (GEORGE GIBBERS) To get started, George thought he'd explain what the man taught him about how things change in spring. (CONTINUES GIBBERING) Birds make nests for their eggs. Horses have their foals. Butterflies are everywhere. And... (GEORGE CHITTERING) Hundley thought George had the worst case of spring fever he'd ever seen. Hundley would never let himself get spring fever like that. It was too undignified. Oh... See, guys? Right there is where the Spring Balloon Rally's gonna be. (GIBBERS) You know, George. Every spring, people fly balloons representing all the stuff that's grown around here. Oh! Uh-huh. (SCOFFS) (GROANS) NARRATOR: Getting Hundley interested in spring things was going to be a real challenge. (GROANS) Okay, we're here! BILL: Hey, you guys! Hey! (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) Who's that? Hi, Bill. That's Hundley. (BARKS) (GIBBERING) NARRATOR: George thought Hundley would like to see Bill's bunnies. Who doesn't enjoy seeing bunnies? (GEORGE GIBBERS) (SNIFFING) So, these were bunnies? They didn't seem to do too much. (GROANS) Oh... Hey, would you please join the Balloon Rally organizing team? So far it's just me and Allie. You and Allie? Isn't she four? I'm five. And I won the contest. Oh. She won a contest to be the rally starter and now she thinks she's in charge. (CHUCKLES) I'm more than happy to help out. George, you want to help me? I'm looking for Harold Mandelbrot. Huh? Bill's bunny, Harold Mandelbrot. She always forgets a simple bunny name. No one name's a bunny Harold Mandelbrot. It's Herbert Nenninger. (CHITTERING) Harold! Ha... Oops, I mean, Herbie! (SNIFFING) (GEORGE CALLING) ALLIE: Herbie! (BARKING) (GEORGE CHITTERS) Hey, you found him! Yippee! (LAUGHS) You're great! Great job, Hundley. (GIBBERING) (SNORTS) (GIGGLES) What a good nose job! I don't think you mean nose job. He did the job with his nose. What else would you call it? Hmm. Hundley... NARRATOR: Hundley obviously wouldn't be happy till he had spring fever. George had to make him love spring, and fast. No one plans like a monkey. So George made a list of fun country spring things. He'd take Hundley to see these things, and then Hundley would surely learn to love spring. (LAUGHING) (BARKING) George's plan had to work. (GROANS) Or Hundley might never move from his pillow. (CREAKING) Sweet dreams, fellas. (CHITTERS) Good night, buddy. (SNORING) NARRATOR: In the morning, George showed Hundley the blooming green hills... (GEORGE GIBBERING) ...which, during winter, had been brown with snow on top. BILL: Hey! (CHITTERS) Hey, you guys. (CHITTERS) I guess a city kid and a city dog don't get a lot of canoe rides, huh? (CHITTERS EXCITEDLY) (GROANS) NARRATOR: Not wanting to be alone in the country, Hundley went along. (GIBBERS) (BOTH GROAN) City kids wouldn't know this, but in spring the river is fast and cold because melted snow flows down from the hills. (CHITTERS) (GRUMBLES) (BARKS) (BARKS) George? Whoa... Oh! Ah! George, you should never stand in a canoe, because... (ALL YELLING) That might happen. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) It's too early in the season to go swimming, guys. That water is cold. (GRUMBLES) Hmm. NARRATOR: Maybe it was best to move onto the next item on George's list. (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) George knew birds flew by after spending the winter down south. Hundley loved birds. Success was assured. (HONKING) (GIBBERING) (BARKING) (CHITTERING) (LAUGHING) (GROANS) I never thought of you as a rough and tumble country dog, Hundley, but you're fitting right in, aren't you? (CHITTERS) (SQUEAKS) (GROANS) Oh... NARRATOR: This wasn't going well and George had just one item left on his list. Surely this would make Hundley love spring. (CHITTERS) (CHITTERING) George explained how the buds came in spring and then became flowers. (SQUIRREL CHITTERING) And he was excited to introduce Hundley to his friend, Jumpy. But Jumpy did not know what to think of this long, low city dog. (SQUEALS) (BOTH EXCLAIM IN SURPRISE) (BARKING) (GIBBERING) (BARKING) (WHIMPERS) Oh, boy. (BOTH GROAN) NARRATOR: So far, none of the things on George's list had made Hundley love spring. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Hold on. Hundley, it's for you. DOORMAN: Hundley. Hi. (BARKING) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hmm. You know, I called to say hi... Uh-huh. Uh-huh. He is sure happy to hear your voice. Is the work done already? Um, no. The job was bigger than he thought, and then it got even bigger. MAN: Okay, I'll let him know. (GASPS) Lost my wrench. Could you go downstairs and get me another? Okay. He is cleaning that building in ways I've never even heard of. Uh, it's not time to go home yet, Hundley. Sorry. (GROANS) Hey, do you want to visit a real farm? I'm going to the Renkins' anyway. The whole town is expecting big things from the balloons and I have to check with all the balloon entrants. (GIBBERING EXCITEDLY) But first, a bath. (GROANS) These are the balloons that represent our town. Oh, they're great! My favorite is the brain! The giant flying brain should lead the rally! That's not a brain, it's a cauliflower. Oh. Well, then the egg should lead, followed by the chicken, because chickens come from eggs. You mean the chicken should come first, because eggs come from chickens. Hmm. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Chicken. Egg. I suppose it would also depend on the local weather conditions and of course changes in barometric pressure... NARRATOR: George wanted Hundley to see the way the farm changed in spring. Look out the window as the sunlight pours into the room See all the smiles upon the faces With everything in bloom Nothing can stop me from heading out the door to take it in With a grin (MOOING) When it's all brand new So many things to learn So many things to do The possibilities endlessly fall into view When it's all brand new NARRATOR: George pointed out that the bigger animals all started small and that he and Hundley started small too. Thinking back to when I was so little Crawling across the floor So many things would make me wonder I wanted to explore My brain was itching They say I'm full of curiosity And I agree (LAUGHS) When it's all brand new (CHITTERING) Yeah So many things to learn So many things to do The possibilities endlessly fall into view (BARKS) When it's all brand new (CHIRPS) (BARKING) George, Hundley, we need to go, more balloon plans to check. Uh-huh. This here balloon is a tribute to fish. Naturally, I'll be piloting the real one. Ah! Ha! We wrote a song for Allie to sing with us when she starts the rally. Ooh! I'd like to sing a song. (PLAYING JAUNTY TUNE) (SINGING) Sea bass and cod Sea bass and cod I caught myself a scrod with my trusty old rod Flounder, tuna, herring Yes, we are declaring We love every fish That is spectacularly fishy. Uh... Thanks. We'll let you know. Come on, we have a lot more people and balloon plans to see. (ALL SAYING GOODBYE) I brought fish crackers and juice. ALL: Fish crackers! Ooh-Ooh-Ooh! (CHITTERING) (SIGHS) It took all day to see everyone's balloon plans. How long will it take us to decide an order? Here's a proper balloon order. Animals first, then fruits and vegetables, then the rest. The order should be funny. Funny is not proper. You're the deciding vote, funny or proper? (STAMMERING) Funny, say funny, funny. Proper. Proper. You know, we'll work it out. Meanwhile, Allie, why don't you work on learning that song the Quints wrote for you? Okay, proper is fine as long as I don't have to sing about fish. Oh, and this balloon goes first. (LAUGHS) Deal! Hey, guys. Good job. Should we show Hundley which is first? ALLIE: No, make it a surprise. (STRAINING) I saw all that water before. Is your basement flooded? No. We drained the water okay, but I put some crates next to the hot furnace to dry. Big mistake. They were crates of unpopped popcorn. Hey! (SIGHS) Some people need to learn the hazards of improper popcorn storage. I know someone who could use all that popcorn. Gee, you'd do that? Well, just because we are in competition doesn't mean I'm not a good neighbor. Thanks, Lydia. You know, I think you're gonna win, unless the judges really like that fresh popcorn smell. Well, who knows? They might. Hey, where's Stew? (COUGHING) Why don't we get any normal calls? (BARKING) DOORMAN: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Bye. It's not time to go home yet. Soon. He said he made a deal with local movie theaters to take all the popcorn away. Huh? I don't know what that means, either. (GROANS) NARRATOR: George had showed Hundley everything. And he still hadn't caught spring fever. Huh? Hmm... NARRATOR: But the balloon rally was tomorrow. (GASPS) George was sure Hundley would have fun there. What could possibly ruin a balloon rally? The balloons will all take off from here, then land in town. Wow. Oh. Allie, as official rally starter, you get to step on this pedal and start the rally. It opens the rings so all the balloons can rise at once. Like this? Oops. No, not now. Sorry. It's okay, Allie. But if the balloons had been full of hot air, they'd have taken off and we couldn't get them back. (GASPS) Oh. So how do we get them back when they do fly? (CHITTERS) Pilots! Balloons need pilots to fly them and bring them back to Earth. Ah! Oh. I get it. Allie, did you want to show Hundley that surprise? Oh, yeah. Come on, guys. In honor of Hundley, the lead balloon is... Ta-da! Take a look. Huh? Hey! Where's the wiener dog balloon? (GRUNTS) I'm going to get it as soon as I'm done here. (CHUCKLES) Who is this handsome young man? That's Hundley. He's our lobby dog from the city. Ooh. Why, you should be proud just to be a dachshund, but to have a good job, too, you are a diamond of a dog. (CHITTERS) (BARKS) Ms. Teckel, we inflate the balloons in an hour. Time's running out. Okay. Who wants to come to my farm to get the balloon? (CHITTERS EXCITEDLY) (BARKS) (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) (CHUCKLES) Never been to a dachshund farm before? NARRATOR: Hundley figured it was about time a dachshund ran a farm. (BARKS) Yes, sir! I will, sir! A dachshund farm is a normal farm where we also raise dogs. Ooh! Come here, doggies. (YAPPING) NARRATOR: It was a like a swarm of Hundleys! Tails don't lie. Hundley was very happy. Hey, Dad. Meet George and Hundley. Hello. Hey, I thought you forgot about our doxie balloon. Doesn't look like much now, but wait till it's full of hot air. (CHITTERS) Are the dogs ready, Dad? We're almost done rehearsing. Come on, guys. You'll like this. We're putting on a show in town once the balloons land. GEORGE: Ooh! (BARKS) MAN: (SINGING) Here we go Everybody do the dachshund dance All we ask is give it a chance You might find it's all you wanna do Get low, real close to the ground Shake and shimmy and then fall down You'll laugh until your face is blue We have a high degree of personality Everybody sing! We are the wiener dogs Stomping our feet and strutting by Waging our tails way up high We are the wiener dogs Flapping our ears and having fun That's why wieners are number one Oh, yes we are Want to watch from the roof? Uh-huh. Okay. Well, we're short, long, brown and sleek But inside we're all unique Not every doxie is the same Some are fast and some are slow Some can jump, others, no But we're all held in high acclaim We have a high degree of individuality George, Hundley, I'm leaving. Dad'll bring you over later. (GIBBERS) (LAUGHS) (BARKS) We are the wiener dogs Stomping our feet and strutting by Waging our tails way up high We are the wiener dogs Flapping our ears and having fun That's why wieners are number one We are the wiener dogs That doxie is number one We are the wiener dogs That there doxie is number one We are the wiener dogs Hey, we're all number one Yeah I said number one Whoo! (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) NARRATOR: George was sure this was the greatest thing Hundley ever saw. Huh? NARRATOR: He must've gone down to meet the dogs. Looks great, Dad. Oh, I have to go hook up the balloon now. Okie-dokie. You guys can't come with me. Sorry. NARRATOR: There had to be a way out of this tangle. Somehow. Hundley was relieved he'd escaped from that floppy balloon. And then he wasn't. This was very undignified. Hundley had to get back to the dachshund farm. But which way was it? He wasn't going to get anywhere standing still, so he took a guess. (CHITTERING) Uh-uh. Hmm. NARRATOR: There had to be some way a monkey could pick out one Hundley in a sea of wiener dogs. Aha! Aha! Aw... NARRATOR: Not one dog came over to clean up the mess. Hundley wasn't here. Where would he go? (BARKING) That lobby dog could never survive in the country! (YELLING) (GIBBERING) (WHINING) To find his way, Hundley needed a good view. And the highest hill would have the best view. (SNIFFING) The air was different here. It smelled like a clean lobby. Except even cleaner. Now here were some very organized, hardworking animals. If monkeys were like that, it would be easy to keep a neat lobby. (YELLING) The time comes when a monkey has to ask himself, "If I were a dachshund, where would I go?" And then he'll go the wrong way... (YELLING) ...because a monkey's not a dachshund. Hundley's stomach told him it was hungry. But there was no food out here. Or was there? Maybe meeting that wild nut-flinger was a good thing. (BARKING) (YELLING) All George ever wanted to do was help Hundley enjoy spring. And now he was gone. (SIGHS) A city dog, alone in the country. Poor Hundley must be terrified. (BARKING) Hundley had never been alone in the country before. It was so quiet. The animals were so different. Curious. Dignified. (HONKING) Orderly. This was really nice. Okay, everyone. Just another minute. Wow. I guess having stuff in proper order doesn't mean it can't be fun. I'm glad you finally think like me. I don't. I think the balloons are so much fun that even a lot of rules couldn't make them boring. You'll grow up and see that it's important to do things properly. Oh, I hope not. Wow. Awesome blowfish, Mr. Quint. Why thank you, Allie. Hit it, Quints. (SINGING) Sea bass and cod Sea bass and cod Please don't sing till after pictures have been taken. ALL: Okay. Hi. Dad will bring George and Hundley later. They were having fun, so I didn't want to drag them away. Ah. Good to hear Hundley's happy. He doesn't enjoy the great outdoors. (BARKING HAPPILY) NARRATOR: Was it possible Hundley had spring fever? It was undignified. So what? The road he was on led George right to the balloon rally. (INAUDIBLE) Huh? Aha! NARRATOR: That looked like a good perch for spotting a short dog. (GIBBERING EXCITEDLY) I can't get the balloons and people in the picture if they keep rising. We're not rising. Are we? (ALL GASP) (CLAMORING) There's no way to get them back. This isn't proper. How could they take off with nobody in them? Somehow the mic stand was on the pedal. But stepping on the pedal was my job. Hey, is that George? (GASPS) (CHITTERS) Oh, no. George! What happened? (CHITTERING) Oh, boy, all those balloons. ALLIE: And no pilots! Uh-oh! NARRATOR: Well, then he'd have to pilot them himself. (CHITTERING) What is he doing? NARRATOR: Now that they were tied together, George was the proud pilot of all the balloons. Yeah! NARRATOR: Except he didn't know anything about being a balloon pilot, and he had no idea where he was going. We can't just stand here and let George get blown away. But there's nothing anyone can do. Hey, guys. I couldn't find George and Hundley. Hundley! Oh, no! He must be up there with George! Can I borrow your truck? Okay. Why? I've got to do something and I'm gonna follow those balloons until I figure out what! Wait till I unhitch the doggies. (YAPPING) (SINGING) Flounder, blowfish, conger Off in the wild blue yonder Farewell to our fish NARRATOR: Hundley reached a high spot like he planned, but couldn't see the farm. (GROANS) He was hopelessly lost. From this high up, he could never spot a little monkey or tiny dachshunds. On the other hand, a giant, flying dachshund was very easy to spot. (BARKING) Huh? NARRATOR: My, that looked a lot like Hundley. It was Hundley! (YELLING) Come on, balloons. Where are you? (YIPPING) What is that? Sounds like the engine! No, not from the engine. It's from the back. (EXCLAIMS) Sorry, dogs, you're coming with me! (CHITTERING) (GROANS) (CHEERING) NARRATOR: It was a long way down. But it was the best view a short-legged wiener dog ever had. (BARKING) (CHITTERING) They were heading home! George thought someone there had to be able to help get them down. (GASPS) There they are. Hang in there, guys. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? DOORMAN: Great news. You can bring Hundley back to the city now. Ha. Funny you should say that. Hundley and George are headed to the city right now. Just go to the roof and look towards the bridge. I'm on the roof. Towards the bridge? Oh. Wow. Hundley and George are in those balloons? They must be having fun. Who's driving that many balloons? Nobody. Nobody? Nobody. I'm on my way. Don't lose sight of those balloons! Don't worry. Nothing could make me take my eyes off them. (GRUNTS) Hey! Sorry. My canopy took off like a kite. Hey! This might make a perfect balloon trap! Will you help me? Of course. What's a balloon trap? (INDISTINCT) (CHITTERING) Is that a pig? No. It's a flying pig, actually. NARRATOR: George tried to ask people if they knew how to stop balloons. Oh, wave to the flying monkey, kids! NARRATOR: They just smiled and waved. (GROANS) (BARKING) (YAPPING) (SHUSHING) Get ready! I don't think two of us are strong enough to stop all those balloons! How can I help? LYDIA: Grab a rope. We've got this high enough that the dog face will pass into the canopy. Oh, gee, there's Hundley. Duck down, boy! In the basket, George! We'll save you, Hundley boy! We got it! Or it's got us! I think we stopped it! George? Ah! (CHEERING) (BARKING) Oh, Hundley, you're safe. I'm so glad you're home. (BARKING) Oh. (CHUCKLES) Oh, hey, buddy. Wow. What a day. Uh-huh. We couldn't have done it without you, Lydia! Why, I always say, there's nothing a doorperson can't do with a plan and a lot of duct tape. I always say that, too! Ooh! (CHITTERING) DOORMAN: Wow! MAN: Yup, it's beautiful! NARRATOR: Everyone came from the country, thrilled to get their balloons back. But no one was more thrilled than Hundley. He was back with the Doorman and on the job. Mr. Mayor! Does one of those balloons belong to you? No, I'm awarding the cleaniest, springiest building prize. We won? Whoo! Oh, Hundley. We won. We did it. And I couldn't have done it without my neighbor and good friend, Lydia. Oh! (CHITTERING) Best balloon rally ever! Let's do it the same way next year! (APPLAUSE) Ready to fly your kite and give a farewell to the spring balloons? Uh-huh. (CHITTERING) (GROANS) NARRATOR: Hundley had been wrong. Spring didn't bring a mess in the lobby. Instead, it brought new things he never would have seen without George. I'll cover for you. Take a break if you want. (BARKING) (CHITTERING EXCITEDLY) (GIBBERING) He's flying it! Go, Hundley! NARRATOR: Spring turned out to be everything George hoped it would be, for himself and Hundley, and this was just the beginning. MAN: (SIGNING) When it's all brand new Yeah so many things to learn So many things to do The possibilities endlessly fall into view Ooh, when it's all brand new When it's all brand new When it's all brand new When it's all brand new
