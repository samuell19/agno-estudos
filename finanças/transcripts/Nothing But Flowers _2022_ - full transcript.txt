[intro music] [gentle music] [Max] When I was little, my father used to tell me to soak moments in like a sponge. [gentle music] [Ash] Hey, where are we going? [Max] Castillos. [Ash] We've been there before, right? [Max] A million times, yeah. This is us. Hey. [gentle music] [Waitress] Hey guys, did you wanna order, or did you want another minute? [Ash] Yeah, it should probably be another minute or so. Yeah, thank you. Oh yeah. You were gonna tell me something? Uh, Yeah. I got into school. Yeah, where? The Manhattan School of Music. In New York? He told me to close my eyes, take a deep breath and really focus on what was happening around me. [Max] School starts in September. So we still have a few months before we have to go anywhere. We? You expect me to go with you? We, I thought that was obvious. That's insane. Okay, listen. My whole life is here in LA. Yeah well, mine too. But that's like, that's exciting, isn't it? Like, I mean, come on. It's New York. Like if there's anywhere to start fresh, it's gonna be there. No? No to what? No, to everything. Okay, I like it here. Like I have a job here and friends and... You know, this is a very weird way of being excited for me. Hey, look, look... There's jobs in New York, Ash... and we'll make friends. We make friends everywhere. - That's not... - Look, if you don't want to go because you don't want to go not because you can't. But why there? Why New York, why not go to a school around here? I mean, then we wouldn't have to change anything. Well, because the school's here, they didn't take me. That's why. And look, Manhattan wanted me they offered me money and everything. Look, you knew I was auditioning so why are you acting like this is such a surprise? I don't know Max. All right... I guess I just never actually thought about what would happen if you got in. [indistinct chatter in background] [Max] Traced my fingers on the great wall of China. Actually memorized the feel of the old stone beneath my fingers. [door opens] [door closes] [keys on the table] [Ash] So what does this mean for us? Tell me. Are we breaking up? Is this your way of breaking up? What are you talking about? Look, I wanted you to come with me. If we're over, it's not because I'm breaking us up. And I know that it's only been a year... and that's not long enough. But it's me and you Max, we're different, okay. Like, I know you, like, I can see you and I can't be the only person that feels that way. - Ash. - I want you to know me too. And I know you made your decision and you're going to school and you wanna leave, but I can't, that's your choice. Like you have something here. I know, I know. Stop, stop saying that. If you really knew you wouldn't be leaving. Look, I can't sacrifice everything that I've worked for just because I'm in love with somebody. I know you don't believe me, but I love you, okay. And I have to go. And I know you won't understand right now, but you will. That's not fair. - What do you want? - I want you. All right and I know I can't have you. [Max] The things I want to tell you, pure, real honesty. I want you to know me inside and out. You did. [voice on TV] Ash. [voice on TV] Please just tell me what I should do. Go to New York. What about you? I'm gonna stay here in LA. What about us? We're done. This isn't fair. Don't you think I don't know that. Ash. - Can we please just drop it, I'm tired. - No. No. I'm just as upset as you are. Why are you upset? I never thought that we'd be having this conversation. Well, me neither. I assumed that you'd go with me. I stayed here for you. I would've gone back home after college. - It's different though. - It's not. At all. Hey look, I barely have friends of my own. We go to your friends parties and party. I'm part of your life here. I'm a guest in your life. Honestly, I thought you'd be happy for me. [Ash] Oh no, I'm happy. I'm super, super happy. You know what, you can at least just try just try to see things from my perspective. [Ash] Oh, your perspective. You're tired of being with somebody that's not going anywhere, so you're just gonna hop in the next plane to New York and go start your career. Yeah, sure. Okay. I wanted you to come with me. I'm not just some piece of luggage you can pack up and ship across the country. [Max] Oh my god, you know I don't think of you like that. Okay, I wanted you to come be there with me, not for me. Yeah, well I'm not going, and you can't make me feel guilty about this. Oh my God, okay. I get that. I know. I get that you're not coming to New York. What I don't get, is... why you think that we'd have to break up right now. [Ash] Because obviously you don't care enough to stay. - Hey, I love you. - [Ash] Stop. Stop saying that. Are you serious? I know you Ash. You think I don't... but I do. You can't be alone. You always, always have to have somebody around. Always. Can you please stop acting like this is the worst thing that's ever happened to you. Stop acting like you're not gonna be on Grindr next week fucking some idiot feeling sorry for yourself. You just need a body. And let's not forget that that's the only reason you wanted me in the first place was that you wouldn't be alone. You found me two weeks after Charlie broke up with you. God, if you were able to bounce back so fast before, I don't think you'll have any problem getting over me. - I love you. - You... you love everyone. Charlie, Greg, Dylan, Noelle, the list, it goes on and on of the people that came before me. No, it's... But that's fine. Because I wanna believe that we had something different. But what makes you think that I don't picture you laying in bed with them whispering about your love and your connection. What's supposed to make me feel any different? [Ash] That's not fair. It's not... Max, it's... This is now. [soft ambient music] It's not your fault. [soft ambient music] [phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] Hey... it's noon. We should probably get up. Do we have to? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, you're probably right. [ring tone] Oh, hello motherfucker. Are you just not gonna answer any of my text messages? What are you talking about? I sent you like 100 text messages. Did you just wake up? - It's noon. - I know, I'm sorry. Okay, well are you coming? Because if you're not coming, then I'm just not gonna come. I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. Hey, slow down there. I can't. I have a lot of packing to do today. Hey, so I think I'm gonna go to Noelle's. You can't stay? I mean, come on. I'll put on a whole show. That just sounds kind of depressing though. Well, I was trying to be sexy. Okay, is this yours or is this mine? Yeah, that's mine. Yeah. You see, this is gonna be so hard to do without you. Hey, we both have big days today. Yeah. What do you have to do today? Hang out with your best friend? Hey, it's a lot tougher than it sounds, okay. You know, Noelle. We should probably go to the gym today too. Ooh. I don't want to go to the gym. I think I'll just probably head to Noelle's. Okay. But I am about to shower if you wanted to join me in the shower. I'll take a shower after I go to the gym. Unless you want me right now. All stinky and morningy. No thanks. - All right, I'll wait 'til after. - Okay, fine. So you're out? [Max] I'm gone. [gentle classical music] You're still here. Shut up. [gentle classical music] So you're heading out? Yeah. Just gonna head over to Noelle's now. So, this will be the last I see you today. I guess so. Well, alright. [gentle classical music] This is so much Noelle. Yeah 'cause I had so much fucking time 'cause you're three hours late. It was his last day. We wanted to sleep in so we slept in. Well, what time is he leaving? I have to drop him off at LAX at 10:00 AM. That's so fucking early. I keep hoping that he'll miss his flight and then he'll have to stay. Makes me so happy thinking about it, but then reality sets in and I realize he would just reschedule be on the next flight in a couple of hours. Well, if he misses his flight, he'll be here forever. [laughs] - Yes. - Do you ever like picture yourself, running to the airport and begging him to stay? Well, I'm driving him there. - Oh. - So I would have to go through the maze that is LAX, find parking... then find his terminal. By then, yeah he'd probably be gone. So no. See, I guess movies are a lot better at that stuff. Yeah. Well it doesn't matter now though. I mean I tried begging him. He's made his decision. I've accepted it. [Noelle] Have you? No, not really. Well what about you? What about me? [Ash] I mean, how are you? I know you're not as beat up about Max leaving as I am, but. I'm okay. I woke up yesterday and I thought to myself... I wanna travel and so... I went online and I stupidly, hastily... irresponsibly, bought tickets to Europe in the fall. [Ash] Really, like where? Norway apparently, it was the cheapest. I don't know what I'm gonna do there. I mean, there's pretty mountains right? I could ride a fucking horse. I could do that. But when are you going? October. I just figured that gives me enough time to get myself out of financial debt before I leave. - How long do you plan on staying there? - Two weeks. That's so long. I'm gonna be here all alone. I'm sorry you're not the first thing I think about when I'm making plans. [Ash] Well, I should be. Max is leaving, I'm gonna have nobody. It's two weeks, you'll be fine. [Ash] Yeah, two weeks of me sitting alone in my apartment. Or you can come with me. No, thanks. That sounds like financial suicide. There are worse things. Anyways, you're a grown man. You should have friends. I was with Max for a year. Okay, that's no excuse. This city is really easy to make friends in. But nobody wants to be friends with a couple. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore right? I'm sorry, I... I know this is really hard for you. Yeah. [Noelle] A year is a long time. Yeah, it feels like he's dying. [Noelle] He's just moving. Same thing. Okay. You don't have to answer now... but did you ever think about moving with him? To New York? - No. - Why not? I guess it wouldn't have worked. How are you so sure? I just know. [symphonic music] Why do you still have this photo? It's sort of awful. Because I like it, it's a good memory. You know, most people throw these pictures away, right? Yeah and most people are ashamed of their past. I'm not one of those people. I'm just saying it'd be fine if this was like at your mom's house. - But why do you have it here? - Because I like it. Why are you so nosy? You know, I do look pretty good in that picture though. You look all right. God, every time I look at it though, I think about all the sex we had that night. [Noelle scoffs] What? Uh... I think you're thinking of someone else. We did not have sex that night. We definitely did. I remember. You couldn't get hard and you just ate me out for an hour. Like I said, sex, you came and you liked it. I came? Okay. You know, I basically look the same. Just a little more facial hair, you think? Yeah. You were a beautiful dude. - I was. - I was obsessed with you. I have no idea how I didn't know you were gay. Hey, it was high school, everybody was experimenting, especially me. Do you remember Marco Ordel? Like the guy who went to Texas for oil. Yeah, why? I guess I always imagined what it would be like if I went with him instead. Why? I thought we had fun. What I mean is like, he really liked me and I really liked you because I thought that you were straight. Well, I mean, I was straight. Fucking a lot of girls does not make you straight. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what that made me. Anyways, I always thought like if I would've went with him then he would've ended up liking me more and then he would've stayed with me for a long time. - Yeah but he left though. - Yeah, maybe I could have left you. Maybe I could have been like the queen of all of the oil rigs. I don't know, I just feel like lately there's been a lot of missed opportunities. I could be in love right now. I just feel like everybody got what they wanted. Well, I'm losing what I want. Yeah but at least you had it, at least you have that memory of him. I never even had that. Yeah, I didn't think you're the type of girl that needed a man to feel complete. I don't need a man, I want a man, there's a difference. Yeah, well I want a man too. No, don't mourn the loss of your relationship. Don't just find someone else just because you can. God, I never thought I'd had to go on another date in my entire life. God, you're making my life sound so awful. I go on dates all the time. You're gonna go on dates when you go to Europe? [Noelle] I'm gonna come back with a Norwegian man to marry Yeah, take him to Disneyland. He'd love that. While we're on the topic, I need to help me pick out my outfit. - [Ash] Oh, for what? - Europe. I need you to look and approve at every single outfit. Oh yeah? Now you need the approval of a male gaze to feel comfortable? Yes, please. God, I hate you. Yeah, and you also have to help me pack. Either that or I can just continue drinking as I watch you pack. But no, I will be for you. I swear. Wow, Max really had been lucky to have you. Yeah. [classical music] Tell me why he's so fucking important. Yep, yep. I'm done with this fucking subject though, it's over. It's done. Yeah, you're right. It's over, it's done. So just stop talking. But it's not because I'm gonna go back home and he's not gonna be there and then I'm just gonna be all alone 'cause he's not gonna be there. He's not gonna be there. He's not gonna be there Ashton. You gotta get that through your head. You're talking to yourself now? Well you're not talking anymore, so. Okay, look... do you really wanna know how I feel right now in this exact moment? I don't know, do I? I think you're being selfish and I love you so I can tell you that. I'm being selfish? He's the one that's moving across the country. Yeah and that's a fact that you haven't let him forget this entire time. How do you think that he feels? Probably proud of himself. Why are his feelings more important than mine? Do you think Max is a bad person? Do you think he has made it his prime motive in following his dream career to break your heart? - No, but. - Okay, well then stop treating him like he's trying to hurt you. Treat him like you love him. - Of course I love him. - Okay, well then act like it. Stop treating him like... you're blaming him for the whole thing. Act like someone who wants him to be happy, and who wants him to succeed. Are you okay? Yeah, I just, I don't think I can face reality right now. I know. You're breaking and it's not gonna feel good. It sucks. Don't I know it. Do you like Max? I love Max, I do. Me too. Oh. What are you doing sitting here with me? You should be with him. You're right. I should be with him right now. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, we're drinking drinks so finish your drink. I impart wisdom on you and you try to fucking run out on me. That's not it. Not today. [soft ambient synthetic music] Hey. Hey. [Ash] Listen... I'm really sorry and... I just hoped that maybe we could go to our spot just me and you. [Max] So how does it feel? - [Ash] How does what feel? - [Max] Getting what you want all the time? I don't get what I want all the time. Sobering up? [Ash loudly exhales] - Sober enough. Which I guess means it's time for another drink. [Max] Oh what, are you gonna be an alcoholic now? [Ash] I used to drink a lot, I'm just saying, you know. [Max] I know. [Ash] But I mean, it was kind of fun then, but I guess it's a little sad now. [Max] Yeah, I think you're a lot more attractive when you're sober. [Ash] Yeah? Oh, it's a good thing I'm sober. [wind blows] God, looks like we came at the perfect time. Yeah, I think so too. Come and take a picture. Do we have to take a picture of everything? I'm not gonna post it. Come on, it'll just be for me. No. Ash, please. All right. Three pictures because I don't wanna be here all night. Fine, three pictures. All right. What are we gonna do? I'll think of something. [warm synthetic music] Thanks for changing your mind. What do you mean? About hanging out with me today. I didn't think you were going to. I wanted to. Not too depressing anymore? It's still your last day. Okay, let's just not say that anymore. Say what? That it's my last day. Why not? I don't know, it's scary. I just keep counting down the seconds. I don't know what else to do. Do me. I wish we could see the stars. City lights are better anyway. So when you first found out about school, what'd you think about? I don't wanna move again. I moved here when I was 18, and I never thought that I was gonna leave. Then I thought about you. Yeah? Yeah. About our future. All right, so in this alternate world... in this different universe or whatever... do you think we would've ended up together? There's no doubt in my mind. [warm synthetic music] I love you. [Ash] I love you too. I mean, I know we haven't talked about this yet... but do you wanna take me to the airport tomorrow? Is that what you want? Yeah. Yeah. I know. Of course. I had a lot of fun tonight. Thank you. Yeah, well I'm a genius. So what are my chances of getting lucky tonight? [Max] Your chances are pretty good. Pretty good or pretty great? Pretty good. Pretty great. Let's go. All right. [door opens] [door closes] [switch sound] [All] Surprise! [Max] Wow. What is this? It's your going away party. My going away party? Yes 'cause you're going away. Beers, beers, beers, beers. It's a party, relax. How did you get in my place? Your bedroom window is open. That's on the second floor. Okay, it's a party, have a beer, relax. - Leah. - Hi. You're here too. [Leah] How are you cutie? [ambient synthetic music] [no in sound] So what's up guys? Everybody having a good time? [Leah] I mean, yeah. We're just hanging out. You know? I'm sorry about like, not having anything snack wise or booze or really anything. We didn't really know we were having a party, so. - I don't know you. - I don't know anybody. Well I'm Alabama, Clay's roommate. I just came into town, so. - Nice to meet you all. - Nice to meet you. You're fine. Alabama Clay brought beer and I think Andrew brought rum or something like that so we're fine. How are you? Yeah, must be weird now that Max is leaving. I mean, we're getting by, you know, just things happen. Are you guys like cool? Me and Max? Yeah, there's nothing wrong. Pretty shitty that this is happening. Why do you think that? Well I mean, he's leaving and you're staying here. Well... I think he means that it's shitty - that you guys had to break up. - [friend] That's what I said. This is your place, right? Yeah, I live here with Ashton. Cool, cool and this is your birthday party? No, no, I wish but it's my going away party. Ooh, that's a bummer. Well happy going away I guess. That's not something people really say, is it? I don't think so. [gentle music in background] - [friend] I didn't know you smoked. - [Leah] He doesn't. [friend] It's okay, it's a special occasion. Ugh, man, I haven't been stoned in like a year. Well where's Max? Let's drug him up too. I have to move in with my parents for like a couple of weeks but hopefully I can find a place by like September. Fuck that, I'd hate to move back in with my parents. Yeah, I mean it sucks. It should only be for like a couple of weeks. And how do you all know each other exactly? We went to college together. [upbeat music in background] Sit down, sweetie. Okay. Here. Ah, thank you. - I like you. - Mmm, mmm. Thank you. So, you having fun? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a blast. I mean, it really came outta nowhere. Yeah. It's really nice of Noelle to do though. Everything's gonna be okay. [melancholic synthetic music] You know, everyone keeps telling me that today. Everyone. But like... I mean, how do they actually, how do they know? [melancholic synthetic music] Do you remember that part in "Rugrats in Paris" the movie when Chucky runs in to stop his dad's wedding and he says his first words. No. Yeah, I do remember, the words were no. That was good. - Are you guys done with this? - Oh my God. - Yeah, sure, take it. - I was so deprived as a child. - Cheers. - Wait, this is all that left? - Oh yeah. - Yeah, sorry. It's fine. Yeah, I guess. Are you kidding me? I don't need the shot. Well, here you go. You need this more than I do. Here, you can have mine. Are you sure? Yeah, I've had enough. What's your name? Wit. Well, cheers to Wit. Oh, oh that's bad. Oh yeah. I think I'm gonna go outside and get some fresh air. Okay. I'll be there in like two seconds. Sure. One, two, three, mango. - Mango. [Noelle laughs] - All right. - I love parties. - Yeah? - Don't you? Watch out for the scissors. Oh, safety first. I'm sorry, that was weird. Cool party, huh? Yeah. I love parties. I love them. Yeah. I'm a big party animal. - Not like that big. - No. Small parties are better huh? - Yeah, I'm a little socially awkward at times. - Me too, all the time. - That's why I'm in the kitchen. - Sometimes I hide in the fridge. - No I don't. - That's... okay. I don't know why I said that. - Me neither. - That's weird. Uh... So what's your name? Oh, Noelle. [laughs] It's nice to meet you. I don't know you. Where did you come from? I'm Alabama Clays new roommate. Oh, that's right. Oh, I didn't know that. - Yeah. - What, another one of those lies? No, no, that was actually the truth. Do you want to know why we call him Alabama Clay? It's not his name? No, it's not his name. It's a very unique name, but it's not his name. Okay, so why do you call him Alabama clay? Okay, so back in the day in school, there was two Clays in our circle. One was from Minnesota. - One was from... - Alabama. Alabama. Ah... Oh... I see where this is going. [both chuckle] And so we named one Minnesota Clay. Don't look over here. I'm looking for Minnesota Clay. He's right here. One Minnesota Clay, one Alabama Clay. Two friends. Forever. - Yes. - That's very clever. I am clever 'cause I came up with it. Oh. [laughs] You're not gay, are you? - No, no, I'm not gay. - Okay. [laughs] I mean, a guy blew me one time, but... I didn't wanna just like tell him to stop, that's rude. So I shouldn't have opened with that. Yeah. I'll be right back. I'm not gay. There you are. - Hey. - Hi. How are you feeling? Are you a little drunk? No, I'm stone cold sober. What? Are you really? No. [laughs] I have something for you. - For me? - Yeah. It's tickets to Norway. I'll go with you. Wait... What? We're going to Norway. I mean, I think I can handle a little financial suicide. Okay, that was either really adventurous or really stupid. Like I know you that you're having a hard time, but you're gonna see him again. Why don't you just go to New York? Why don't you just go visit him? You don't know, maybe you'll like it. Maybe you'll stay. [melancholic synthetic music] I'm not going to New York. - Ash. - No, I have to quit lying to myself about this. Okay. I don't wanna believe he's leaving, but I have to. [melancholic synthetic music] [Ash] Why can't I be happy? And there's nothing I can do to make him stay. What if he's my soulmate? [upbeat music in background] [Ash clears throat] Say you love me. I love you. And hey, I'm sorry about all this. [Max] No. No I had no idea Noelle was gonna do all this and I know this is our last night together and I just want it to be special. [upbeat music in background] [Max exhales] What time is it? Oh my God. It's one. That's nine hours left. Yep. There's still one very important thing that we haven't done today. What's that? You know perfectly well what's that. Right now? - [Max] Yeah, right now. - But... Yeah, yeah. Yeah, right now, let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, they're almost gone. Let's just wait 'til they leave. All right? I'll see you soon kid. See you soon, sir. [indistinct chatter in background] [Noelle] Everybody, everybody, everybody. Thank you all for coming. [laughs] Okay, so you all know me. You all know Maximilian and you know Ash, the loving boyfriend. So who here hasn't heard Max play? No... Noelle no. - Not right now, please. - This is the time, now. You are all in for a treat. [Max] No, don't. Go. - No. - Come on, get up here. Come on, come on, get up there. Stay and play. Play. [whispers] [laughs] [piano classical music] [piano music fadeout][ambient music] [Max] Hi. [Ash] Hi. It's nice to hear your voice. [Max] Yeah? [Ash] Yeah. [Ash] Nice but weird. [Max] You doing okay, Ash? [Ash] Yeah, I guess I've had a lot on my mind. [Ash] There's a lot of things I want to tell you, but... I don't know how much time we have. [Max] I have a minute. [Ash] I guess more than anything I've just been thinking about that last night, saying goodbye not saying goodbye. [Max] It doesn't matter. [Ash] It matters. I was young, stupid. I wasn't ready for the conversation. [Max] It doesn't matter. [Ash] The only thing I need you to know is that you made an impact on me. And that might mean nothing to you, but it means a lot to me. Like you mattered. I'm sorry that I wasn't... ready for you at that point in time in my life. [Max] You don't have to apologize. It's been so long. [Ash] I still think about you Max. [Max] I think about you too all the time. [soft ambient music] [car passing] Hey. Hey. Do you wanna share an Uber? Sure. Cool. You made me so happy today. I tried. I know this is hard for you. I think it's hard for me too. Hey, I always knew you were talented. I knew before you did. I just didn't think it would take you so far away from me. Yeah, I didn't either. There's a lot of things that I didn't know about you and that's what I wanted. I wanted to get to know you and... I just wanted you to be happy. I was happy tonight. Thank you. For what? For everything. For being there... for me. I mean... I'm just scared this entire thing and you've just loved me the entire way. Why are you scared? You are my safety net and you're not gonna be there anymore. I'll always be there for you. Yeah, but... it's not gonna be the same. Unlike when I'm here and having a bad day, I can cheer myself up because I know I'm coming home to you. I'm not gonna have that anymore. You can still text and FaceTime or whatever. Yeah but you know, eventually we're just gonna, we're just gonna text less and less. And then eventually it's just gonna be good morning and goodnight texts and then just one day, it's gonna stop. You're just gonna forget to text me completely. Move on. I hope that doesn't happen. I'm sorry. I really am. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. Max, I love you. I love you too. Please stay. [very soft ambient music] [melancholic music] [ring tone] [phone vibrates] [melancholic music] [door opens] [door closes] [knock on door] [door opens] Hey. [Max] Hey. - Can I come in? - Oh yeah, sorry. Of course. Nice place. [door closes] Yeah, thanks. I'm gonna grab something. Did you want anything to drink? Sure, sounds great. [Ash] I'm gonna have a vodka tonic, is that cool? Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. So how tall are you? What? Oh, I was just asking. How tall are you? How tall do you think I am? Well, I mean your profile said you were six foot. You look a little shorter. Yeah, I lied. It's fine, I don't usually go for guys taller than me anyways so. - Thank you. - Yeah. You wanna do back to back? What? Back to back. Is that some sort of weird fetish 'cause. No, like stand up straight. Oh, sure, yeah. Congratulations. You're taller. Like I said. So... am I what you thought? You're handsome, yeah. Yeah, you are too. [ambient music] So you've met a lot of guys on this app? Kind of, I mean, whenever I'm bored or... lonely. Have you? Sometimes, yeah. I just want to get to know somebody and... I want them to know me too. Yeah, that sounds nice. So... can I see you again? [Max] Yeah, that sounds good to me. So, I sort of have an embarrassing question to ask. What is it? I forgot your name. It's Maximilian. And you have a terrible memory, Ashton. Just call me Ash. You can call me Max.
