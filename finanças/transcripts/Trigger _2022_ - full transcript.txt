Listen, we must create a data of these criminal records in our computer. -Understood? -Okay, sir. [cicadas chirping] Boss, he is coming. Hey, hey! Hey, don't! -Ah! Ow! -Get him! Hey, save him! Hurry up, move! I am telling you... -Go inside, quick! -Do it. [indistinct voices] [groaning in pain] [commotion continues] -Hey, what's your name? -Michael. But you don't look like a chain snatcher. This is just for now. You must obey my orders, understand? [all] Alright, boss. -Who is he? -If anyone works without my knowledge... He is the only macho in this jail. Everyone obeys his orders. -Got it? -Yes, boss. -Huh? -Yeah, boss. [muffled groans] [laughs] You are such a big gangster, then why did you rob a chain and came here? If we want to get the control of a city... Then we must know about all the criminals in the city. Only if one comes to jail in such petty cases, cops won't focus on us. Do you know why I surrender now? Because I am going to do a business. I need men for that business. And the prisoners of this jail... ...are apt for that. [sports channel playing over TV] -It's gone. -Hey! -Look here. -What is it, mom? I have washed this shirt many times, but the stains won't go. Why do you need to get into quarrels and fights? When I was helping an injured person to get in an auto, those stains got on my shirt. Fine, but how is that possible? Every month couple of people fall down in front of you in an accident. If a person is found injured on the road, everyone just ignores him. Should I ignore him too? Hmph! Mom, these kind of stains stick only to the people with good heart. -I don't feel like believing you. -She started it again. Karthik, come out! It's getting late, I gave my bike for service. Hey, I am ready but your sister-in-law is late a always. Dear, Sree come fast, my boss is calling from the office. I am coming Karthik. Damn! Hey, give this in the laundry store beside your showroom. -Bye, mom. -Bye, mother-in-law. -There is no one here, I am late again. -Total 40 members had died... only in our state. This is all our fault. -Hey, what's the time now? -Sir? The time? I don't have a watch, sir. Didn't get his watch it seems! What sort of a shirt is this? Flashy colour paired on a vest! It's fashion sir. The hell with your fashion. Hey, don't you dare to sit, Get out, stand there till the meeting concludes. Is he a police commissioner or a school teacher! -What? -Nothing, sir. Okay, okay guys, let's have a recap. -See... We are following, -What is this, dude? -this operation from past 6 months. -Shut up! The repaired old guns, pistols, and rifles in our police department armoury, we usually melt them all. I the process of shifting for smelting... someone got in illegally, stole all the equipment, then separated them part by part, and started packing and storing them in scanners, printers, TVs, etc., and in all electronic equipment. In past one year they stole nearly 100-150 weapons in the same way. Now, almost since six months, they tried to shift all the weapons in a big consignment. The reason behind all this is him. Pandiyan. So, guys we need to nab, both the buyers and the sellers, with evidence in this operation, okay? Opponents can be armed so carry necessary weapons with you. This operation would be lead by-- Uff, I should only take care of all the things. -Yeah, tell me, whom should I finish? -Deva... -Deva? -Sir? Deva, you lead this operation. -Sure sir. -All the best. -Thank you sir. -Good choice. Sir... All the best. Keep it up. Jai Hind! Sir. Jai Hind! What kind of person is he? Hey, sorry dude. I thought you would lead this operation. -But this commissioner-- -Hey, there is nothing. Alright, how can we know the time and the location of this consignment? Already I have set an informer among them. -I will come tomorrow, dear. -Alright, dad. Talk to the uncle. Murthy, at what time will the consignment arrive? Based on their discussion, I think it might reach by 10 o'clock, sir. Fine. Sir, I trust you, that's why I am taking this risk. I was a goon, so no one allotted a seat for my kid. But you got him an admission and making him study. That's why, I am doing this, sir. These guys are real bad, sir. If something happens to me -Please take care of my son, sir. -Trust me, Murthy, I'll take care of him. -You just do your job carefully.-Alright. sir. Thank you. Uncle, my dad will come home, right? Hmm. Hey, we are getting late, load it up. [cicadas chirping] [groans in pain] Prabha, I think one of your informer got caught. When are they coming? [mobile rings] -Hello? -Sir, the deal isn't happening here. Moreover, our informer got caught. Then, don't go inside. Just abort the mission. Guys the mission has been compromised. I will follow them to find out where they are taking the consignment. You all go back. You rascal! How dare you inform the cops? Hey, load it fast. The cops will be here any minute. -Hey, you get started. -Alright, brother. How dare you trick me? I will kill your son and your whole family. No one will be alive. Hey, Deva, I can't find Prabha. What? Hey, Prabha... Hey, listen to me. Don't take hasty decisions. It's common that informers die in such operations. Sir, I trust you, that's why I am taking this risk. Dad will be back, right? Hey, you are seeing him just as an informer, but I am seeing him as a father to a son. If you do something stupid you will loose your job. -I give a damn! -Hey, Prabha... Listen to me. [pistol cocking] [shots fired] Who is that? [pistol firing continues] [pistols cocking] [shots fired] Hey! [groans] [shots fired] [shots fired continuously] [pistol cocks] [shots fired continuously] They separate guns into parts and store them in electronic equipments. [breathing shakily] Hey, cop! Put the gun down and run away. I know how important he is for you. I will kill him, if you don't go. Throw the gun down. I said throw the gun down. Shoot him. [shots fired] [groans in pain] [breathing heavily] Hey, hey! Your dad got humiliated because he was a cop. That is why I am telling you, Prabha, you shouldn't ever get a thought of becoming a cop. You are going to fulfil your mom's wish, isn't it? Sign this and leave. Fine, a last chance for you. If the same situation repeats, will you choose your department, or would you choose your sentiment? If you want to choose the department, tear this, apologise and leave. If you want to choose your emotions, then sign this and get out. That informer trusted me sir... I can't leave him behind and run. Mr. Satyamurthy, you have alzheimer's disease. There is a chance you might forget your day to day activities. The next stage is, Dementia. You would need clinical assistance. A nurse or some one should be there to look after you. Doctor, dad got hurt on his head 25 years ago. Do you think that would be the reason for this? After getting hurt to the head, the stress he has undergone, might be the reason. Art and music therapy... -Are you following it, right? -Yes, doctor. Good, good! By listening to his favourite old songs and by sketching his old memories, his memory loss issue will be gone. I shall leave. -Prabha... -Dad? When is your mom's birthday? This month or the next? She will get angry if I ask her. Can you tell me? This is my birthday. Don't think you are forgetting. Check this if you can't remember. I shall leave now. [mobile camera clicks] -[indistinct voices] -[groans in pain] What's next, boss? We have got all the cases cancelled till now. Only case we have on us is 'burning down the evidence... by entering the commissioner's office'. Seshu, someone must admit this case, right? Your family is with me. Don't worry about them, I will take care. TRIGGER [shot fired] [thunders rumbling] [traffic honks] -Huh?-Hey, it's late. -Cops might catch you, come fast. -Don't irritate me, mom. -I will come back. -Prabha... I was searching for you everywhere, what are you doing here? -Get in. -Why are you searching for me? -You fired me from my job, right. -Come, I will drop you home. I know my way to home, you leave. It's raining get in, quick. Come get in. He fired me from my job and came back to me. Hey, did I fire you from your job? You resigned, isn't it? Fine, tell me why did you join police department? My dad was a good cop. But in others view my dad was a failed police officer. By being a good cop, I joined this job thinking every salute I get is given to my dad, sir. But you fired me from my job, right. Okay, cool. That shop serves great coffee, they use jaggery. I think your life is set by opening a hotel before you retired, huh? Sir, why did you bring me here? -Wait, I will explain. -Sir, how are you? -I am fine. -Coffee? -Thanks, brother. -Thank me after drinking it. -That's it. -What's this man? Yes, sir... I gave him a herbal coffee. I'm serving this to everyone so that no one enters here. -I'll bring neem decoction it's tasty. -Hey, get lost. No one should ever come this side. -Read this paper. -I can read this paper than drinking this. Our cops killed an innocent girl, by torturing her in one of our police station. I know, sir. I have read it. Among the cases filed in our states police department... Among 340 cases our cops has done the crime. Do you know why our department turned to be so disgusting? How would it change if you fire a good cop like me? Sir, you brought me here to have a coffee, right? Why are you irritating me by bringing me to a useless place like this? Forget it. What do you feel after looking at this place and the people here? [imitates gun fire] [laughing] Cheers. Yo! Yo, yo! Yo, yo, yo! [sniffles] Ah! -Bun? -Do you want this bun? I feel like some useless family is living here, to fill their hunger as they have no other way. -What can I do by knowing all this, sir? -[laughing] Can you believe if I say they are all undercover cops? -Huh? -Ah? That day everyone in your team were following the police protocol perfectly, but you thought about a common man risking your job, right? In the same way, they also thought about other people and got suspended from police department. [laughing] Hey, elephant. We can access all the videos and audio of the police stations around the city. A street will be clean only if a house is clean, a country will be clean only if a street is clean. Only if a police station is clean, the 5 kilo meters area around it will be clean. From assistant commissioner till constable, we can track everyone's mobile phones here. So, Prabha, your duty is monitoring and reporting. Wherever a cop commits a misdeed in the city you will have to inform immediately. No one should know that you are a cop no matter what situation it is. So, welcome to the 'internal affairs'. You can do your job from here. This hotel is your police station.

Waste fellow. -Listen to me. What happened? Somebody help, my brother has had a heart attack. -Come on, hurry up! -Oh no, he is going to die... Please someone help. -Sir, she is crying please help her. -Hey, I came to pick someone... Please leave me. Let me go. Sir, he is my only brother, please save him. -Now watch. -Are you done? Sir, please, I am getting married next month. It will be awful if my parents got to know, sir. Please delete that video, sir. -Please I beg of you. -You won't listen if I say nicely. Wait, I will upload your video. How will you do that? -Please, sir don't. -Just wait and watch. Hey! My mobile... Did you see my mobile? Ah! It was fun. She slapped so hard. Hey, it was you who stole his mobile, right? You stole it, man. -You? -What are you staring, thief? -I didn't steal anything. -Thief, thief, thief... -Hey, stop... Listen, -[muffled voice] it should be with me if I had stole it, right? -Check it, if you want. -I don't know all that. You stole it. -Thief... Thief! -Hey, shut up! I am telling you to shut your mouth, right? I will smack you. Why are you just watching when she is calling me a thief? I don't know, come let's go to the police station. To the police station? Who is the witness? -Please come... Come. -What's the problem? -Tell her frankly whatever you saw. -Yes, madam, I saw he stole the mobile. -Me? -Please come, sir. Let's take him to the nearest police station. -Listen dear, please don't... -To the police station? -Don't take me to the police station. -Come man, let's go to the police station. If you take such people to the police station they will corrupt the officers. Let's do one thing, let's take him to the commissioner's office. -That's best. What do you say? -Thank God! -To the commissioner office? Let's go. -Hmm. Ah! Oh God! -One slap. -Constable, take him to remand. -Okay, sir. -I am helpless. -Please sir. -Let's go, our job is done. -Sir, can you wait for a minute? -Actually... I will discuss about the sections with him, -you please wait outside, okay? -Yeah, we will wait outside. Hey, come here. I asked you to be an undercover officer who monitors corrupt cops, you got caught by an infant kid. Is this how you work? What? Watch this. It's ACP Karunakar's mobile. He recorded a girls video. Think what you need to do about him, you shouldn't just shout on us. Damn! -[kid cheering] -[groans in pain] -This is my card, I work there. -Please don't hit me, sir. Hey, what are you talking to her, when I am getting hit by these cops? -Fine, bye. -No, sir. -Nisha, let's go. -Sir, don't hit me. -Ah! Ow! Don't sir. -Will you do it again? Prabha, look here. Hey, look! Prabha, ask them to stop! Sir, please sir... Don't. Ah! You were with Michael for these many days... -Hit him. -how dare you betray him? [groans weakly] -Greetings, Michael. -How are you, dad? Tell me, Aadi? We have planned for a consignment for tonight, dad. Today my men are getting released. Make them do it. Did you see what Michael did to you for being trust worthy? What are you going to do now? Michael's consignment is about to arrive tonight, it will be a checkmate to him if cops catch it. Das, please save me some how. No, Michael's consignment would be confiscated today, Michael will die. That too in your hands. Come on. -Hey! -Go forward. [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] Catch him. [mobile rings] Okay! Guys, 100 kg s of cocaine, -is been smuggled on Bangalore highway. -Is it? -[crowd cheering] -Come inside. Cover the gap. Come sit, let's watch who is going to win. -That's it, man! -Hey, come on! [tires screeching] Did the cops seize Michael's consignment? -Come on, catch him. -Hold him... -Hey! -Don't let him go. How dare you smuggle cocaine? Get off the truck! [mobile rings] Hello? [mobile rings] Dad... Cops caught our truck. [laughs] Your game is over. -I will take care. -Nobody on Michael's side? [crowd cheering] Michael...! [crowd cheering] Michael...! -[crowd cheering] Michael...! -Hey, give that to me. -[crowd cheering continues] -Finish him, man! That was a cake walk. He himself got caught. Hey! Hey! [pants] There is a cat who doesn't know who he is... and thought he was some Lion or a Tiger... and roamed around the forest arrogantly. In a forest where a lion rules, though it belongs to the cat species, a cat can never become like a tiger neither like a lion. Now, does the cat understand, who is the cat and who is the lion? Ow! Ah! "Love is an illusion, it's a valley" "You will get doomed if you fall for it, a girl is danger..." [bike beeps] Hey, Prabha, how come you are so relaxed? He is coming with the number plate. First stop the music, he is going to screw us. -His song in between. He is here. -[singing random Telugu song] -Sir, want to have a tea? -No need. -Will you have a tea? -Hey, sit down. Sir, have almond... -Sister... -Hey, hey! Don't you have sense? Your job is to monitor what cops are doing and report it to me. Yes, sir. Karunakaran was suspended for his mistake. Then, why did you hit him, that too at his home? Karunakaran got bashed? Look at this, come on... Look... Being undercover means your identity shouldn't reveal. What if his house was under CCTV surveillance... and your bike number got recorded? If your cover is blown, no need of criminals... just cops are enough, they will finish you. You don't understand the seriousness of this issue. Fine, I understood, sir. You will never mend your ways in this life. You are good for anything. We can punish a cow, but you are good for nothing even if I punish you. -Bloody life! -Owner... What can we do, it's just batter? -Let's make idly with it? -Batter? -Hey, what a surprise! -Who is he and why is he scolding you? -He is the owner of this hotel. -So, what? He is scolding because the batter fell down, you don't feel bad. -Why are you here suddenly? -Hey! -Hey! -Today's our wedding anniversary. -Did you forget? -What is this Prabha? -Happy wedding anniversary! -Thank you. -Happy wedding anniversary! -Thank you, bro. Let's go to any good restaurant and chill. This is also a restaurant, right? Let's eat here. -Isn't it a good one? -Is this a restaurant? -What is he saying, hubby? -This is also a restaurant. -Get in. -Let's eat here. -You guys carry on I will join you. -By the time he got ready-- Hey, excuse me. I was watching you scolding my brother, do you know who I am? There is no chance you would know, I will tell you. Do you know Dhoolpet Ravi? He is a thug. When I requested to be friends on Facebook he accepted it. Even my brother doesn't know this yet. We are such type of people. I will finish you better leave quickly. Go, man. Oh no! Huh! Silly fellow! Hey, what did you talk to him? I told the truth. Don't worry, he won't mess with you here after. He is like a kid got afraid of me. -Oh God! -You sit. So what if he's your boss? He can't scold you. -Yeah, you are right. -Why are you working for him? Looks like the whole family is crazy. Why is he scolding you like that? -Leave it. -Why are you getting scolding? -It's your anniversary, right? -Yes. Let's rock it. Do you know the speciality of our hotel? There is no 'menu card'. The Bharat Vilas hotel's aim is about the customers freedom. Sir, which hotel you like, tell us it's name, we will give the same taste here. Oh, Mainland Hong Kong... -Okay. -We need such soup. -Did you hear? -Yes. I can hear, but ask them which soup they want. Which soup would you like? -Er... Tomato is fine. -Tomato? Tomato... -No, let's order Mushroom. -Okay. -Hey, tomato or mushroom? Mushroom soup. One mushroom soup from Mainland restaurant. Okay. -Where is the soup? -Two minutes. -Let's try it. -Next? Oh no! Sister, he is walking straight inside. You are only going to get us caught don't over act. -Oh no! -Mushroom, it seems. Careful, you will fall. -How do you do? -Go, woman. -She is trying for films. -[indistinct voices] Mushroom soup is ready. He is acting as if he prepared it. -Let's order main course next. -Yes, tell me. -Once on Siddipet Highway... -It's 42 kilo meters. It would take an hour. Ah! It would take an hour is that okay? -An hour, why? -What is this, hubby? -There would be traffic, right? -Actually, it's 42 kilo meters, we need to get the taste from there, right? -That is why. -He is right. -Sir, tell us if there any hotel nearby. -Nearby... [music mutes voices] -Hey, here. -Thanks, man. Hey, Karthi, why is sister-in-law very moody? Prabha, it's our 10th anniversary. We don't have any kids till now. We even tried IVF a couple of times. It was not successful. Not able to tell to anyone... and not able to condole each other, we are suffering from within. Oh, sorry. No need to worry, dear. Dear, are you feeling bad because you don't have kids? Even I had kids. They grew up, settled down in good positions... but all of them left me alone being selfish. Only a blind person knows the value of light. Similarly, kids who are orphans know the value of parents. Remember one thing, Only if born to us, then only are they our kids? -Hey, who is he? -Karthi, wait. Your child might leave you alone someday Similarly, if you become a mother, to an orphan child, that kid... I swear, will not leave you until you die. They won't leave you alone. -I don't know what wrong did I do... -Brother, please calm down. Sorry... -Please come, brother... -My son left me alone. -Sorry, sister-in-law. -It's alright. Okay? Come, brother. Come with me. -My son left me alone. -It's okay, calm down. Only if born to us, then only are they our kids? Sister-in-law, the way he expressed might be harsh, but whatever he said was right. Do you need a kid born to you... or... do you guys just need a kid? [children playing indistinct] Nisha, what are you doing? You said today is Grandpa's birthday who is coming to visit us. So I am making a gift for him. -Hello, madam. Hi! -Hi! -Excuse me, Please take these bags. -Yeah? -Hello, I am Prabha's brother. -Hello. Oh, hi! -Didn't Prabha came? -He is coming with his dad on bike. Um, okay. [music mutes voices] [indistinct kids voices] Dad, keep walking. -Please stop. -[indistinct voices] [all] Happy birthday grandpa! [all] Happy birthday grandpa! [all] Happy birthday grandpa! Happy birthday. [all] Happy birthday grandpa! [indistinct voices] -[groans] -[indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices continue] Hi grandpa, how are you? I am fine, dear. Sree, I am happy with the decision you took. But are you okay with it? I am okay with adopting a child. But look, there are so many kids, every child is special in their own way, right? This isn't any saree shopping, to choose one among many. I can't do it. If we need to adopt only one child among them, it's very hard for me. -Happy birthday! -What is this, dear? Grandpa. How's your birthday gift? Heard that you were a cop, is that true? That is why I gave you a gun. God bless you! Thank you. Ah, no! [music mutes voices] I want green colour... -I want green colour. -Prabha... -Sweet girl, bye. -Bye. -Take care, okay? -Bye. -Bye, dear. -Bye. -What's up, bro? -We like Nisha so much. Okay, I will discuss with her, you leave. Bye. -Janani... -Huh? We are planning to adopt Nisha. There are many legal issues for adopting Nisha. Won't you do it for me? There is so much of documentation process. Umm, give me your number, Any document it may be I will send straight to you. Your number starts with 91... Actually, in the business card there is only orphanage's landline number. So, I am asking. No, it's fine. I took your sister-in-law's number. I will call her if I need something. Did you take it? Fine, I will also leave. Where are you going? I am not going anywhere, tell me? Nothing, you came here today... and served the children expensive food. Today you fed them, but won't those children expect for the same food the next day? Did you ever think about this? I am not saying what you did was wrong. But this one day expenditure, could be used for the kids regular expenditure, is what I thought Damn! This stupid brain didn't get that thought. I will do something about it but first give me your number. Hey, Prabha, I gave you her mobile number long back, why are you asking again? She made my mouth shut. -I shall leave now. -Hmm. [thunders rumbling] [cicadas chirping] [church bell tolling] Hey, catch it. -Dad... Save me. -Hey! -Help me. -Catch him. Let him go. Hey! Dad, save me. Please save me, dad. -Hey! -[groans] [groans in pain] Thanks uncle. Are you okay? [clock ticks] [kids singing rhymes] How can you give the girl who we adopted to some other family? You can't give away Nisha like that. Madam, we were looking after Nisha very well for the past 2 years, do you know how much we are suffering as she isn't with us since 6 months? Just giving a child for adoption isn't our job. Taking care of how she is living, is she happy or not, is also our responsibility. She doesn't like living with you. That is why we had to bring her back here 6 months ago. What would she know? If you let her be, she will get used to it. This attitude is the problem. People like you are adopting a child for the society. Adopting isn't just like petting a pup. That it wags it tail and follow you even if you treat it with love or not. They are kids. They know... if you are really treating them with love or not. We found a family where Nisha will be loved and taken care very well. I believe that she will be happy there. You please sign this document and leave. But we can't leave her. Nisha is our child. I won't sign. It's just a formality, I know very well how to take Nisha to that family. You can leave. -Please madam... -Hey, come on! I know very well how to take her back. [playing stone paper scissors] [laughing] [playing stone paper scissors] I have cut you both... Yes, Janani? Sister, I didn't tell her about this surprise. -You also maintain the same.-Fine. Fine, she is coming. -We are starting. -Fine, come safely. -Bye... -Nisha, are you happy? Shall we go to your parents? Fine. Hey, where are you? You haven't come home last night. -I am in the restaurant.-Hey, you know what today is? We are bringing Nisha to our house. -Without you we can't do it. -I will not miss it. I will be there by the time Nisha comes. [tires screeching] -[groans] -Who are you, guys? You shouldn't call me with my name any more, -you should address me as uncle. -Okay. Sir, it seems someone had kidnapped a girl in Ashok Nagar, second turning. Over! -What happened, man? -Look, Prabha. [tires screeching] Look in which direction the van is going. [colour smoke hissing] Someone at Abids Road is pointing a gun and threatening everyone. Beat 42 please go to the spot immediately, over! [siren wailing] [tires screeching] -Leave me. -Hey! Don't shout! Get down! Come on. Let me go, man! -Hey! -Who are you? -Ah! -Hey! -Hey, tie her up! -Okay. Let me go. Why are you doing this to me? Prabha, the jeep which is sent to save the girl has met with an accident. -Why is he... -Prabha... This isn't our job, cops will take care of this, -Brother, tell them? -Then. who are we, sister? Inform it to the cops, they will go. All the beat cops are busy, If we wait till they go, then they will spoil the girl. -Prabha, hey! -Prabha... You know very well about the commissioner. Already you are under suspension, If you do any mistake you will loose your job. Is it about my job? It's equal to my hair. Brother, at least you tell him. Prabha! Oh no! What are you doing, brother? -Come let's go. -Hmm. Boss, we are ready, Just waiting for your order. Why didn't the cops come? Prabha, there is an under construction building in the area you are in. They went inside it. -[sobbing] -Hey, give me a smoke. One minute, I will be back. Hey, no Raju! They just asked you to kidnap her. Don't create unnecessary problems. We are going to jail anyhow, the girl is hot, there is nothing wrong in it, Mani. Leave me, man! Chain snatching has happened in KK Nagar. Beat 32, I request you to go to the spot immediately. Our police vehicle met with an accident in Ashok Nagar. Some guy is threatening everyone with a gun, police beat which is nearby immediately go there. Go inside, guys. Thank you. Please brother. Leave me, brother. [whistles] [groans] Hey, someone came in, come on. I am coming, brother. -Hey... Hey! -Hurry up! Look that way... Catch him, he is escaping, Yes, this side. You go that side. -Go search that side. -Where man? [indistinct voices] Ah! Hey, come man. [groans] [electric crackles] Janani sister... Janani sister... Sister? Janani sister... Sister, I am scared. [sobbing] Janani sister... Sister...? [muffled voice] Sister... -Nisha? -Where is she? -Nisha? -Nisha? -Nisha? -Nisha? Where does Nisha go? She was right here. [sobbing] Brother, save me. Save me, brother. Hello, is this police station? Someone kidnapped a girl in Metro Mall. Police beat who is nearby please go to the spot immediately. A person is threatening people pointing a gun, in Abids. Here it's total traffic jam, we can't reach the spot, send any other beat. Over! We have got a complaint that a girl has been kidnapped in Ashok Nagar. Our car met with an accident while going to the spot. Beat 48 reporting, we have come here to solve a chain snatching case. Send any other beat, over! Sorry, madam, the police beats in your area are busy in different cases. You don't worry, cops will come as soon as possible. We have got the girl in the vehicle safely. -Janani? -Prabha, I have called the cops number of times, but all the cops are busy it seems. I am very scared. No, Prabha, it's not clear in CCTV. In the same time nearly 50 vehicles came out of the mall. I can't tell you which one among them clearly. They have planned it very smartly. I think the people who kidnapped Nisha and the college girl are same. Prabha, how can you be sure that one team did both the kidnaps? Janani called cops many times when Nisha got kidnapped. But none showed up. In the same time all the cops were busy in different crimes. No, they kept them busy. Who are you all? We are here to solve a chain snatching case. I can tell you that this is all done by one team, for sure. I didn't understand, Prabha. Do you think they deliberately surrendered to the cops? There plan is to get caught by the cops. Look at this. This is the pattern Mexican drug cartel's follow. If they want to smuggle 100 kilograms of cocaine, they smuggle 100 kilograms of weed in the same route. The one who informs the cops are also them. By the time cops catch the 100 kilograms of weed, They will smuggle 100 kilograms of cocaine without anyone's knowledge easily. They named this as parallel crime or deviation crime. They followed the same strategy to kidnap Nisha. If we understand this smartly, we can find Nisha for sure. They are the one who threatened me at the orphanage. Okay. We can find for sure. You don't worry, okay? Search for the group of police stations which were busy in past 3 months and in which areas. One minute. Prabha, 24th of last month, the police stations which are on the highway of Hyderabad to Vijayawada, Nalgonda, Suryapet, and four more police stations got a complain in the same time. Like you said almost 2 hours all the police stations were busy. In the same time cops caught 50 kilograms of cocaine in the forest. 13th of this month, the same happened, in Abids and Banjara Hills. In these two events, one thing must be common. A person or a vehicle, or something will be common. Find that soon. -Prabha, -Ah? an Audi car with number 0370, has been in the place where both the events took place. Check the CCTV footage of the mall Nisha got kidnapped. One minute. The same car was present in the mall too. Track the car. Prabha, that car crossed Panthangi toll plaza. That car crossed city limit. We don't have the camera access to monitor that car. It's a top end car, hack the GPS of the car and tell me in which route it is going. No, Prabha, it's an international company car, we can't hack it's GPS. There are no cameras on the road, there will be a camera in the car, right? Check if you can hack that car's reverse camera or not. [static buzzes] [beeps] Yes. Prabha, that car is made in Germany, but the reverse camera is China made. Let's catch it. Prabha, that car is crossing Nandigama. -[groans] -We told you to kidnap the girl... but, how dare you try and take advantage of that girl? -[bashing] Brother... -Hey! I will... Who is screaming? They are our men, boss. They did what Aadi told them. But they tried to take advantage of the girl. They are all got booked under rape charges. -That is why they are bashing them. -Hey... They got caught by the cops, right? No one knows it. No boss, the one who came isn't a cop. Someone else came in and did this. Hey, did you see his face? No, brother, he bashed everyone wearing a mask. He was very cautious that his face shouldn't get revealed. [cicadas chirping] Hey, the route the car is going, looks like a godown. Damn! Prabha, they turned the car off. No camera access now. [car beeps] [gasps] [mobile rings] Dad? A girl is missing from the last consignment, we got her now. Her deal was already closed, dad, it's a big loss if we leave her. Are you mad? Aadi, you should have left the girl. You did a mistake. Someone came and bashed our men, it seems. And now you have this girl. If he is smart, he must be nearby you, for sure. -Where are you now? -In our godown. Leave that place immediately with your gang. -What about the girl? -Burn down everything, man. Damn! Hey, burn this place. You start the vehicle. [girl crying] Help. I am scared, please help me. [car beeps] [engine starts] Prabha, they turned the car on, we got the camera access. But I don't know where the car is. Please save me. I am scared, please save me. I saw your bike Prabha. They are in the building you just crossed. I am scared, please save me. "Trigger... Trigger!" "Trigger... Trigger!" Finish him, guys! -"Trigger... Trigger!" -Hey! [shot fired] [shots fired] [shot fired] [groans] Hey! A fire accident took place in a godown last night, in Malakpet. We found six dead bodies which were burnt completely. Cops are still... "Trigger... Trigger!" Hey, I must come out today itself. Make arrangements. He killed everyone. -Sister. -Nisha! [sobbing] Were you scared? Fine, don't cry. Sir, the details you asked for. Keep this girl with you for some days. There will be two cops for your safety always. They will take care. Every detail of the family you gave her for adoption are in this, right? -You have no other records, right? -No. They are brother and sister-in-law of my friend Prabha. Don't tell anything about this to anyone. Janani, I know what you are thinking. But it will never happen again. You are not understanding, Prabha. Two people were lying dead in front of me. Thinking of what happened to Nisha makes me shiver. You must forget them Janani. The people who did mistake died. That's it. How can you take it so easily? I am worried every second. The orphanage and the kids staying here, they are my world, you know? If something happens to them... Nothing like that would happen, Janani. You are telling very easily that nothing will happen. I called cops many times when Nisha got kidnapped. But no one came. How are you telling me to be brave? [sighs] I am the one who saved Nisha that day. It was me who told her not to tell you about me. I work for the undercover division in the police department. I won't let anything happen to anyone till I am alive. Listen, no one, my parents or none know about this. I am sharing it with you, that means, you, Nisha... and everyone out here are important to me. I am with you. I will lay down my life to save everyone. [indistinct chatter] Come Michael, how are you? This is your old bungalow, bro. Looks new, isn't it? I cleaned it, boss. I have heard about you, boss. I wish to become like you. I feel excited seeing you in front of me. I think I am talking more, you relax. I will wait outside. Only Aadi managed to escape Michael. He is in the hospital outer side of the city. He was shot in the middle of his forehead. The one who came was well trained. Aadi isn't smart enough to escape from him. He made Aadi escape and he planned to see me. He would have come to the hospital where Aadi is. Brother, I just entered inside. Are you all in the position? He will come in for sure. I must see his face. He killed everyone. I must see his face. [cicadas chirping] [dog barks in distant] Prabha, Aadi is in second floor. Listen to me, let's call the cops. I think something is fishy. Even we are cops, let's take care. -Prabha... -Huh? Brother, I asked you to stay in B-block, right? What is this, brother? You might need it, please keep. Prabha, someone is going into Aadi's room. Dad, Aadi, you are an idiot. You made a big mistake. Did you see his face? I didn't see properly, dad. There was smoke all over. You weren't useful for anything till now. At least lets see if you will be useful for this or not. There is a guy, I sent him to kill you. -Dad, what are you talking? -Stay silent. -He will kill you easily and go. -Dad... No, dad, I am your son. Before dying, you must know the truth. -You are not my son. -Dad, what are you saying? -My son isn't stupid like you.-Dad. -Please let me go. -He is very intelligent. -Which floor are you going to, sir? -3rd floor. [elevator bell rings] Brother, brother... Please don't kill me. Brother... [groans] [screams] Brother, Prabha's number is not reachable, he is in the lift. I think there is a problem in second floor. -Hey, who are you? -Hey, you! [indistinct voices] Hey, move! [indistinct voices] You are saying it's a hospital, how to escape if there was any problem? Look, he will be right there. Keep the knife on his throat and escape. Catch him. -Hey! -Don't harm him. [indistinct voices] He is a cop right? when someone is going to die in public he will definitely come to save. I will definitely see him. -Don't harm him. -Let him go. If your cover is blown, they will kill you. I will kill him, if anyone tries to come close. [indistinct voices] Anyone help him. [gun fire] Ah! -Hey, run... -Hey, move! -Hey, you will get hurt. -[indistinct voices] He closed in on us. Before he finds out about us... We should finish him. Here is your tea, brother. We never had such disturbance in the past 15 years, Michael. How did he come? For the past six years... around 42 cops were arrested and jailed. More than 30 officers were suspended. I think you are aware of this. When I got released, I have seen one DC in jail. I am sure this is done by internal affairs team. Cops have the mobile of the deceased who died in the hospital, right? [mobile chimes] Hey, Perumal... I have hired you because our men rush without responsibility. What is the meaning if you do the same thing? You are about to get 58 years old. There is no use for you to be here. I will make your PF settlement by next week. Without talking anything just take the VRS and leave. Why do you need... Unnecessary jobs? Does it mean pride! Look, because of your insanity you lost your job. What will you do now? Ah? Huh, you won't change. -Get lost. -Damn! [clears throat] Why did you hurry, brother? But if you had not fired, then I might have done that. All... You did this all because of me, right? No, Prabha... I didn't do this for you. A father is always a hero for his son, right. Hmm. But to my son, I am a drunk and corrupt officer. My son was 15 years old, when I got fired for being corrupt. But no body knows that it's not true. Only the commissioner knows that. There is no use in blaming my son. Someday, he must know the truth. I am not a drunkard. I am capable. I did this for myself, Prabha. What to do... He doesn't know that I did this. He may not know today, but I must do a great job someday, Prabha. My son should know who I am. I will do it. Prabha, this is the mobile of the deceased who died in the hospital. I have searched it, I didn't find anything, other than a voice note. Hmm... Play it. Hey, bloody cop! I thought of seeing you today, but you hid yourself among people like a coward. You might have seen many villains, but your bad luck, I came as a villain into your life. Don't think that you will die a normal death. I will kill everyone who are with you. You have a family, right? I won't leave a single person. You will die after watching everyone's death. When I come in front of you, No one would be alive to stand by you. Prabha, did you see, she left and I am late this time. -Hey, Prabha, Karthi, -What mom? Your dad is missing, son. -I've searched every corner of the house. -What? -Mom, did you check the terrace? -Yes, son. He wasn't there. -Don't know where he went. -Fine, we will go search for him. -Pra... -Hey, Karthi, you don't go anywhere. -Stay here. -Okay. -What is this, son? -Sit down, mom, dad will come back. Dad... What are you doing here? I don't know Prabha. I remembered something and came here. -I couldn't find way back home. -It's okay, hop on. [church bell rings] -How did I reach there? -Dad, don't worry about that? You go and take rest. -Go. -Mom... This is all common because of the problem he has. Mom please, stop crying. Mom, take dad inside. -Come let's go inside. -Go. I am troubling you, right? Lakshmi, I am not doing this deliberately. Oh no! [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] Father, have you seen him before? No, sir, I don't remember. Father, that old age home, since when did it exist? Since 25 years. Since how long you are staying here Father? It's been 30 years that I am serving my lord. Then, it wasn't an old age home when you came? It was an orphanage when I came here. In 1 year, the kids in that orphanage were adopted. That is why they changed that orphanage as an old age home. How many kids used to live in that orphanage? Nearly 50 to 60 kids. 60 Kids got adopted in 1 and half year, weren't you sceptical? What do you mean? Isn't it a happy thing for kids to get adopted in families, right? Why should I doubt about this? So can I... I mean, can I talk to the then incharge of this orphanage? Hmm, here... His name is Seshu. He used to be an incharge of the orphanage. But in the year 1993 a fire broke out in the old commissioners office, there was a news that he died in that fire accident. Which file, son? The file which has details of dads head injury, mom. Why Prabha? Doctor asked for it. This is the bullet recovered from Selvem's body who died in the hospital. To know who they are we only have this loop. I know a cop, if I ask him he would give us the details immediately. They are monitoring us through cops. Oh! So, it's not possible to take any cop's help. Then, with whom shall we enquire about it, boss? [chuckles] [mobile rings] Karuna, how's life after getting fired from the department? I have even heard that your family left you too. Who are you? I don't know if you will become a cop again or not. But don't you feel like slitting the throat, of the person who is the reason for your dismissal? I can help regarding that. Just do whatever I say. I didn't see his face, sir. But he came in this car and took the gun. [mobile chimes] [camera captures] -Hello? -The car number you shared, isn't in any govt. record, sir. Thank you, Ramesh. I have seen the vehicle. In the year 1993 there was a fire accident in old commissioner's office. Same day someone attacked my dad. His name is Seshu. He used to be the incharge of the orphanage. Nearly 50 to 60 kids got adopted in one year. They are committing crimes using those kids. There is some connection between that and my dad's case. I just don't get it. Ask him to finish anyone who gets into the car. Boss, what should I do if the person who comes isn't the one we are looking for, but if it's someone who works for him? Weather it is the last person in the team, seeing him die, he will shiver, right? Then you finish him. [thunders rumbling] I don't understand what they are doing with the children, they adopted from the orphanage. Prabha, you can ask Janani, she knows very well about adoption, right? Fine, it's already late and it's even raining, -I shall leave. Bye. -Okay, brother. Bye. [thunders rumbling] -Brother... -Yes, coming? What is it, Prabha? -I feel something is wrong, brother. -Ah? -I think they planned to kill Perumal. -What are you saying? Yes, I see people. Did they find out it's him? Which vehicle did Perumal use to take the gun? He went in his car. Sir, sir... -You left the parcel. -Parcel? Brother, they planned for you if you get into the car they will kill you. Just walk away. Sir, the Sambar is hot, we have added two types of pickles too. Take care, sir. Good night. -What happened? -They know our place, sir. We need to find out who he is. Take a look. That was the last case your father handled, Prabha. He told me that he kept the collected evidence in the record room. A fire accident happened in commissioner office. But it was planned one. A case was filed on your dad, a day after getting admitted to the hospital... It was a child kidnap case. Sir, being a cop he kidnapped my son. Tell me, what should we do to such people? I know that your father is an honest cop. But the evidence against him was solid, We had to dismiss him from the department as we have no other way. I have tried to ask your dad about the case. But he doesn't remember anything about that incident. That's when my father found out about the child trafficking case, sir. But none supported him in the department. It wouldn't have become such a big crime if they had supported him. Look at this, sir. These are the bullets which I bought from the black market. It was given to some outsider from the police evidence room. Moreover, I don't understand whom to believe, sir. Frankly, I can't even trust you, sir. Prabha, now you turned into a real cop. What did you do with Perumal's car? [gaming sound] Brother, they are asking when is the next consignment? Is it? Boss, they are asking about our next delivery. Cops are interfering in this... Do you think this is the right time to do it? This consignment should happen tomorrow. And will surely be done. -Yeah, thanks. -Why did you ask for these details? I have seen a crime report, Janani. It doesn't look like Nisha's kidnap is a planned one. It seems like it was done in haste. I have seen many grill boxes in the godown in which Nisha was kept. They have kidnapped many children like Nisha. Okay, after giving a kid for adoption, how many days will you monitor if the kid is safe or not? We monitor for 3 years. Sometimes we go directly to their house and check. In the same way we brought Nisha back as she isn't comfortable with her parents. So after 3 years you don't check whether that girl is safe or not, right? No, Prabha, kids gets attached with their parents within 3 years. Later if we check again, they will feel like we remind them they are orphans. There are details of more than 200 children who got adopted in past 3 years. But how would you find out about the kids fake adoption? It's me, I will send you some addresses, just check if those kids have any Aadhaar or any other verification. Also check whether they are been sent to the school, or they are getting home tuition. Okay, Prabha. Why do you need the details of the kids who aren't been sent to school? They don't let the kids interact with the public who were adopted. In the same way they won't have any ID proof. Because when kids who have ID's go missing, they will all get trapped. If we get this list. Then we will know who they will kidnap. Boss, there won't be any mistake right? Why didn't you join her in a school? Actually, ours is an inter caste marriage. So, we have threat from my parents side, that's why I didn't send her to the school. Fine, I shall leave. -Sorry, I forgot my mobile. -It's okay, take it. -Bye. -Bye. [together] 1, 2, 3... -Hey, you won. -Let's hide. Run, run... Isn't it a mistake to not registering her name in Aadhaar list? Okay, where is the girl? Where is she, madam? She went to her grandparents house. Then, call them. Sorry, they don't have a mobile. Janani, I think there is something fishy. Mom! -[laughing] -Huh? Hey! -How are you? -I'm doing good. [tires screeching] Mom... Mom! Why aren't you sending her to the school? You know about her health condition, right? That is why we chose home schooling. -Mom, help! -Hey, drive! Let's go. -Mom, help! -Let's leave, quick! Please help me. [music mutes voices] Boss, our men kidnapped the kids. [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] [mobile rings] -Prabha... -Sir? Someone kidnapped 20 kids around the city randomly. They demanded a ransom and asked them to come to a location tonight. Is this connected to the case you discussed with me? No, sir. They are adopting the kids and kidnapping them after 3 years. They won't kidnap for a ransom. Moreover they won't kidnap in public places. This is a different case, sir. Sorry, sir, don't take me wrong. This is just a general enquiry. Okay, madam. Let's go. Today in the city 20 kids were kidnapped. They asked their parents to come to a roof top bar with money. First follow this case. Hmm, okay, sir. Listen dear, go to your room and play, I'll be there in a minute. -Go. -Bye. Janani, she is getting attached to us and she is happy. Slowly she is forgetting that she is an orphan. I feel, your visit might remind her that she is an orphan. Call me whenever you want about her details. Or if you want to meet us then we will come directly. But please don't come home like this. Mmm. She means the world to us, ma'am. Please understand. Please. Fine, sorry. No, Prabha, I know them from 3 years. They are taking very good care of the girl. Definitely it's not them. You shouldn't believe someone so quickly. -Did she leave? -Mmm. What is this? She came suddenly and questioning. Do you think they got to know something? Don't worry about that, we managed her, right. Now that Aadi is no more... Whom should I tell about this girls visit? Ah? Whose mobile is this? [door bell rings] Huh? [groans in pain] Speak up, you bastard! [groans] Don't hit my dad. What are you doing to the kids, after adopting them? Don't hit my dad. -Take her. -Uncle, don't hit dad. For the sake of money you act like you love her. But she is crying while I am bashing you. You are not a human! [groans in pain] When are they coming? This girl must die tonight. Kill every kid in her orphanage. -Where is the girl? -She is in the car. It seems they are coming tonight for the girl. I will stay here you leave. Mmm. Nothing will happen, Janani. I will take care, you leave. Hmm. Boss, I have a bad feeling about this. Should we do it tonight? You must finish the job tonight. Get going! -Let's go, guys. -Come on. [mobile rings] Hello? Brother, it's me. Tonight they planned something. I don't understand which kid they are targetting. Do one thing, take our team and go to the orphanage. Fine, Prabha. Hey, who are you? Ah! -Huh? -[groans in pain] Dude, her father is coming with money. [mobile rings] Boss, he isn't answering. Check if he has got any other number. [mobile rings] -Hello? -My child... Why are you crying, dear? They bashed my parents and brought me here. Where are you now, dear? Earlier, I used to be in an orphanage, right? They are inside. Kill them all. Gilli, Gilli! Take the children and go inside. -They are here, go inside. -[indistinct voices] Janani, take everyone inside, hurry up! Careful. Why are you locking it up? -Brother... -Hey! Brother, what are you doing? [knifes swishing] You are going alone by locking the gate, I will also come. Gilli, can you do me a favour? After I die, go to my son and tell him... That his father saved 30 kids, 4 cops. -And died like a cop. -Don't brother. -Go! -Give me the key. I will also come. Hey, don't harm my brother. -Hey, I am talking to you. -Hey, oldie! -Open the gate. -Brother, brother... Give me the keys brother. -Brother... -Finish him, man. Brother! -Brother, open it. -Hey! [groans] [indistinct voices] Dude, I think everyone here are his men. [knife swishes] Brother... Hey! This is Deva reporting, Our team is under attack in the Highlight bar. We need immediate police back up. I repeat it's an emergency. [mobile rings] Tell me? Hey, Prabha, your friends Deva and his team are trapped. Damn! [groans] Brother, where are you? What happened, brother? [elevator chimes] [elevator chimes] Hey. Raj... Hey, Raj, hey! Hey, Raj. [body thuds] [gun fire] -Prabha... -Hey! Hey, Vikram. Hey, Vikram. -Hey, get up. Careful. Nothing will happen -[weak groans] What happened? Deva... Deva. Deva? What happened to him? Deva... Hey! [gun fire] [groans] Boss, this fellow would have escaped. Throw the gun down. Do it, or he will shoot him. [pistol clanks] I did everything. Let him go. He has nothing to do with this. Boss, why do you waste your time talking to them? Let's shoot these two dogs and leave, boss. Huh? Cops... [shot fired] [groans] [shot fired] My son isn't crazy like you. He is very smart. Didn't I tell you, when I am in front of you, no one who stood with you will be alive. I just realised who you are. You are also same like your father. Then, our country population was almost 90 crores. Among them orphans were 5 crores. [children playing] There is no one to question if something happens to these orphans, right? I am giving you a job. You must adopt the kids and keep them for 3 years. After 3 years, kids will be mine and this will be yours. No one has the time to think about orphans. But your dad has thought about it. Sir, someone was asking us to adopt children from the orphanage... and raise them for 3 years. They are offering money too. I have doubt on them, sir. Which orphanage? -Sir, this is... -Satya Murthy... We can't file a case without any crime. Already we are burdened with current cases. -Sir, please listen to me. -Please. Please understand. If you find anything is fishy then collect the evidence. We can take care of it later, got it? Your dad gathered every detail about me and kept it in the commissioners office. Those files had every detail of my modus operandi. That is why I burnt down the commissioner office. As all the evidence was destroyed, -your dad did a crazy thing out of anger. -Please save me, dad. That is why this case was filed on him. I thought to kill your dad. -Hey, move!-After that in the police station... People who saw told me that, your father has gone mad. I felt proud, because I was the reason behind it. Don't leave him, sir. I made a mistake. I should've killed your dad, you and your family then itself. It's not late yet. Let's end this. You are very smart, dude. If a person like you is with us, we will get caught for sure. Huh, that is why... Hello, dad! How are you? I want your signature on my rank card, dad. Hey, Pandu... There is a person named Murthy in your gang it seems? He is working for the cops... Take care of him. Hey, if you take decisions in hurry you will lose your job. It's just the job, I don't care. I removed you from your job as planned. Dad, the load is with us. Even the vehicle with kids have left safely. I took the bullet picture from the commissioner's office. [camera capture] You are not in the department. I too believed that you are working in some hotel. I waited till now that someone who monitors the cops will come. But I never thought that you will come. I didn't find any other way. Hey, I trusted someone like you... I should kill... [shot fired] [siren wailing] [sobs] [indistinct voices] I don't wanna go, dad. Please... -I will not go... -Get in. We raised her with love, dear. Please don't, Let us take her home. Even I can't live without her, but what can we do? They will kill us if they get to know. Dad! Dad! Dad! We don't wanna go, please leave us. [girl crying] [indistinct voices] [indistinct voices] [clears throat] Do you remember me, sir? -No, I don't remember. -What, sir... Don't you remember me? I have selective amnesia, I don't remember many things. You are the reason that I am in this situation. We both together did many great things. You forgot very easily. Be careful. I will see you. Shall we leave? Who are you, grandpa? -Janani is waiting... -Sir... The girl. She is our orphanage girl. We have some legal formalities. I will bring her back after completing. Come dear. We will come back to your grandpa after seeing your sister Janani. Okay? Nothing to worry, Prabha. We are all here. Doctor, told you must take rest. Where is brother? He got hurt, he is beside. Nothing to worry. -He is good. -Hey, what happened? Hey, Asif... -He is in some sorrow. -Brother, shut up! Prabha, they are all lying to you. They killed Perumal brother. He is dead. Hey! [knife swishes] Hey! [knife swishes] Hey! -Ah! -Brother... Why did you do this? Tell my son. Oh no! Brother... [sobbing] Someday, I must do a great job, Prabha. My son should know who I am. Prabha, why didn't you tell me, that you are a cop? Would you let it go if I had told you? Son, I raised you by telling the reasons of your father's situation, right? Even after knowing all this. Why? Sir, I think you already paid the bill. Did you forget? No problem, thank you. Look at dad, someone is kidnapping many kids these days... and no one has the guts to question. He alone stood for those children 25 years ago. Everyone are calling such cop a mad fellow. Some times, even I feel the same when I look at him. But I understood that he is a genius. This case is the one which wanted to solve. If I don't go now, my dad, Perumal brother, and those children, will have no meaning to their lives, mom. Prabha, no. I will go, mom. Hey, get up. Hey, I am talking to you. What is it, man? If you put me in jail alone, do you think I will tell the truth? -Get lost. -Huh! -You will say it now.-No, don't hit me, sirr. Don't hit me. -Kumar? Kumar...-Please don't hit me. Dad, ask him not to hit me. -You tell them, dad. -Sir, tell him not to hit. Tell him not to hurt him, sir. I will tell the truth. They are doing this since 25 years. Their business is to kidnap children. Their business happens in dark web. The route where they smuggle children from is called Silk Route. In Chennai - Andhra coast, they switch children through boats. Once they are on the boat, that's it. They don't know in which country or to which job they go. They are using boys for terrorist activities, and girls for prostitution. [cicadas chirping] [thunders rumbles] Prabha... Your sister-in-law is crying. I think I might have handed him the girl. I don't understand what's happening. Dad, we are going to save those children. Even Nisha is with them. Today the one who did this will come to our house. And kill everyone in front of your eyes. What will you do, dad? I won't even remember the words you said after 10 minutes, Prabha. You... How are you trusting me? This case is opened by you, dad. You are the only person who saw him. You will have a cop in you always. He won't forget anything. I have trust on that cop. Now, you have to take care from here. [thunders rumbling] They have changed Nisha to a truck in front of the ATM in Malakpet. Keep me posted which route that truck takes. Alright, man. Prabha, that truck is going towards Nellore highway. [tires screeching] Your dad collected all the details in which route I am taking children. -Hey, Asif... -Tell me. The one who plans smartly, why should he change her in the truck, in a public place that too in front of ATM CCTV camera? He gave us a easy clue to find Nisha, that means, Nisha is the deviation. Inform the cops on NH-45 and ask them to block the truck. Okay, dude. Asif, which highway does NH-16 lead to? Prabha, it's Nellore to Tada highway. Sir, ask cops to check every vehicle which is going on NH-16, sir. It's parallel crime, sir. They kidnapped Nisha on NH-45 he deviated us and kidnapping other kids in NH-16, sir. Check all the vehicles going on NH-16, We need to find out in which vehicle the girl is going. [indistinct voices] [mobile rings] Michael, we are going to the court. We shouldn't? Where shall we come? Hey, cops have blocked the way, but don't stop. Sir, that school bus went into the forest without stopping. Over. -Stop the vehicle. -Do it. [indistinct voices] Sir, there are no kids in the truck you asked me to check. Prabha, Nisha isn't in that truck. You don't worry, cops surrounded school bus in forest, For sure Nisha will be there. [children crying] Leave the children and go, or we will start firing. Boss, cops surrounded us. What do you want me to do? Do as I say they will leave. Hey, cop! Go back, or else we will kill everyone. -Let me go... -Hey, shut up! [indistinct voices] Hey, I am asking you to sit. -Hey, hey... -He is escaping. -Go get him. -Come on, go. Hey, stop! -Hey! -[groans] Sit down. Why do you need the details of the kids who aren't been sent to the school? People who fake adopt the kids in this way, they don't let the kids interact to public. In which school you are studying? Little Flower International School. Asif, I have sent you a photo. Send total details of the kid. Just a moment. Prabha, like you said he isn't kidnapped from the orphanage. They kidnapped 20 random kids recently, right? He is one among them. Then, if Nisha isn't in the bus where she'd be? That means, Nisha isn't the deviation. That school bus is the deviation. [children crying] Boss, even he is here. Huh! Hey, where will you go? Sir, don't give shooting orders in haste. Just hold them for sometime. Hey, now you can go guys. Hey, don't make noise. Hey! Stop crying! They are taking the children on NH-16 in some vehicle. Prabha, on NH-16 many vehicles go. How can we find which is it, among them. Asif, listen to me. NH-16 is forest area, in every camera there will be infrared sensors. Hack these cameras immediately and scan every vehicle with IR. Okay, Prabha. Prabha, they are taking the children in the cement truck which is going on NH-16. [children crying] Prabha, that truck is going slow. I think it might be 200 meters away. You can catch if you go soon. [tires screeching] Sir, I have seen the vehicle in which kids were getting kidnapped. Damn! He is here drive faster. Dad, he is here. --Sir? -Tell me, Prabha. Listen to me... 5 kilometres away there is forest check post. Ask our team to assemble there. We need to save the kids, no matter what. [tires screeching] Damn! He missed. [groans] How are you, sir? I don't remember who you are. -Don't you remember me, sir? -No. [pants] Hey! -Hey! Hey! -There it is... -Start the vehicle... -Come on, guys! Drive faster he is behind us. Drive faster, Hey, let's go. Hurry up! Don't stop. [tires screeching] [indistinct voices] Hey, drive faster. Go, go, go. Hey, come front in same way. Come on, come on, run him over. [children crying] Fast, drive faster. I am tell you go, man. -Drive faster. -Move, move. Get in faster. Give it. Hit him, hit him man! [tires screeching] [groans in pain] Hey, go faster. [indistinct voices] [groans] Ah! Ah! Ow! Hey! [pants] Hey! -Hey! -[children crying] [groans] Damn! [children crying] Don't stop. [children crying] Mom, save me. [weakly groans] Get up, man! [children crying] Hey, shut up! [pistol fires] [pistol fires] Hey! [mobile rings] Hey, bastard! Leave the kids and my son right there and leave. With what guts you left everyone alone at home? Is it because your dad an old cop is there? Useless fellow, he is sitting like a mad man at home. [thunders rumbling] I feel proud thinking it was me who made him like this. Hey, if you don't leave from there... Every person in your house will die. Come and carry them all. Will you leave from there or you want to listen each of their's last voice? [pistol fires] It's your son who died. Hey! -Hey! I will... -Bastard, do what you can do. Bloody rascal! I am going to kill that girl first. Now listen to her voice. [pistol fires] [sobs] [groans] [shot fired] [pistol fires] [pistol fires] Everyone used to see my father as a loser. Someday my dad will win, I will make him win. [screams] In the same town where people search for fertility centres for kids, there are orphanages who search for parents. People who go to fertility centres, if they go to orphanages, they will get children, even those children will get parents.
