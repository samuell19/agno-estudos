DOESN'T IT SEEM CRAZY THAT THEY'RE STUCK IN JUNIOR FOR TWO MORE YEARS? GORDIE TURNED PRO AT 16. MY BOYS CAN'T EVEN BE DRAFTED UNTIL THEY'RE 20. IT'S A DIFFERENT TIME, COLLEEN. WHY? THEY CAN VOTE, THEY CAN DRINK, THEY CAN SMOKE, ABOUT THE ONLY THING THEY CAN'T DO IS EARN A LIVING PLAYING HOCKEY. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, FOXY, DOES YOUR WHA LEAGUE HAVE THE SAME AGE RESTRICTIONS AS THE NHL? WELL, TO BE HONEST, I DON'T KNOW. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD FIND OUT. GOOD NIGHT, GENTLEMEN. DID WE JUST GET PROPOSITIONED BY A HOCKEY MOM? I BELIEVE WE DID, HARV. [TELEPHONE RINGS] HELLO? YES, UH, ONE MOMENT. GORDIE? MM-HMM? BILL DINEEN'S ON THE PHONE. [QUIETLY] I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.

YOU'RE WHAT? OUR LAWYERS SAY IT'S LEGAL, AND WE THINK THAT HE CAN PLAY IN HOUSTON THIS YEAR. I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE HEADS-UP, BECAUSE ONCE WE CHOOSE HIM, ALL HECK'S GONNA BREAK LOOSE. THANK-THANK YOU, BILL. ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE, GORD. WHAT DID HE SAY? WELL, FOXY'S GONNA TAKE MARK WITH THEIR FIRST DRAFT PICK. HE THINKS HE'S READY TO TURN PRO RIGHT NOW. [CHUCKLES] FROM THE TORONTO MARLIES, THE HOUSTON AEROS SELECT MARK HOWE. [MURMURS OF SHOCK RIPPLE THROUGH CROWD] [BUZZ OF WHISPERED CONVERSATIONS] FOXY WOULDN'T PICK YOU IF HE WASN'T SURE YOU COULD PLAY AGAINST MEN. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, YOU AND MARTY COME HOME THIS WEEKEND, AND WE'LL TALK IT THROUGH. OKAY. BYE. SO, WHAT DID HE SAY? IS HE EXCITED? [SIGHING] UH... I'M NOT SURE HE COULD TAKE IN THE HONOR. I THINK HE'S, UH, HUNG OVER. I'M SORRY? HE ASKED ABOUT MARTY. THAT'S THE ONLY THING HE ASKED. IF ANYONE'S GONNA TAKE HIS OLDER BROTHER. [CHUCKLES FONDLY] AW, HE'S SUCH A GOOD KID. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THEY DID TAKE MARTY, THOUGH? TWO HOWE BOYS STARTING OUT TOGETHER? I HOPE YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE THIRD HOWE IN THAT PAINTING. THAT WAS A FOOLISH OLD DREAM. [ROOM ABUZZ WITH NEGOTIATIONS] FOURTH PICK TO THE HOUSTON AEROS. WHAT ABOUT THE SWEDE? INGE HAMMARSTROM-- I CAN'T PRONOUNCE HIS NAME EITHER. WHAT ABOUT MARTY HOWE? ANOTHER UNDERAGE PICK? ANOTHER HOWE? FROM THE TORONTO MARLIES, HOUSTON SELECTS MARTY HOWE. [ROOM ERUPTS WITH CHUCKLES] HEY, FOXY, WHO'S NEXT, COLLEEN? [LAUGHTER] IF THOSE HOWE SIGNINGS GO THROUGH, EVERY HOT-SHOT JUNIOR IS GOING TO BE SHAKING ME DOWN FOR SIX FIGURES! WE ALREADY LOST TO THE WHA OVER HULL AND THE RESERVE CLAUSE.

I'LL ASK PRESIDENT CAMPBELL TO CALL HOWE PERSONALLY. YOU KNOW, GORDIE'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOOD OF THE GAME. YEAH, YOU DO THAT. YOU GOTTA LEAN ON THE BIG FELLA. IF THEY SIGN THOSE JUNIORS, THE BUZZARDS'LL BE KICKING US WHERE IT COUNTS. I TALKED WITH THE GM, AND WE'RE GONNA BRING YOU MORE INTO HOCKEY OPERATIONS NOW, GORDIE. WELL, THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED, BRUCE. GOOD. GOOD, THAT'S SETTLED. NOW, I UNDERSTAND CLARENCE CAMPBELL CALLED YOU ABOUT YOUR SONS? HE SET YOU STRAIGHT ABOUT THEM SIGNING WITH THIS PHONY LEAGUE THAT'S ROBBING US? WELL, BRUCE... NOW, WHAT KIND OF FATHER WOULD I BE IF I DENIED MY BOYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LIVING DOING WHAT THEY LOVE? AND THE AEROS ARE OFFERING THEM $100,000 EACH TO PLAY HOCKEY. HELL, THAT'S AS MUCH AS I MADE PLAYING 25 YEARS FOR DETROIT. IS COLLEEN BEHIND THIS? LET'S LEAVE MY WIFE OUT OF THIS. I WISH I COULD. I KNOW IT'S BEEN YOUR DREAM TO SEE YOUR SONS FOLLOW YOU AS A RED WING, SO I'LL BE BLUNT. IF THEY SIGN WITH THE WHA, THEY'RE THROWING AWAY THAT DREAM, AND JEOPARDIZING THEIR CHANCES OF EVER PLAYING IN THE NHL AT ALL! WELL, I GOT OTHER DREAMS. WE DONE, BRUCE? ARE WE CLEAR HERE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WITH YOUR BOYS, BIG FELLA? ABSOLUTELY. YOU'RE 45 YEARS OLD, YOU'RE RIDDLED WITH ARTHRITIS, YOU'VE BROKEN MORE BONES THAN EITHER ONE OF US CAN REMEMBER-- I KNOW. I KNOW HOW HARD IT'S GONNA BE TO COME BACK. HARD? HONEY, AT YOUR AGE, IT'S CRAZY. AND DANGEROUS. WHAT ABOUT NORRIS? HE'S GOING TO BRAND YOU AS A TRAITOR? AND WHAT ARE THE FANS GOING TO SAY? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH THE RISK. YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TO PLAY WITH THE BOYS, AND TO START 'EM OFF RIGHT. I KNOW, BUT IS IT THEIR DREAM, TOO? YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME, PLAYING SHINNY, AND PLAYING CHARITY GAMES. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. YOU'RE ASKING A LOT OF ME, TOO, YOU KNOW? TO JUST GIVE UP EVERYTHING I'VE BUILT HERE? A LOT OF CATHY AND MUZZ, TOO. I KNOW. I KNOW I AM. BUT... ISN'T THIS WHAT AN ADVENTURE IS? ISN'T THIS WHAT YOU SAID THAT WE HAD TO LOOK FORWARD TO? [CHUCKLES RUEFULLY] LORD, I DIDN'T MEAN THIS. I'M MOVING TO TEXAS. I'LL CALL THE KIDS IN TO EXPLAIN. NO, NO, NO, NO. I WANT TO SURPRISE THEM. [SIGHS] HARV. GORDIE. FOXY. GORDIE. [CLEARS THROAT] NOW, FOXY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY... TO THREE HOWES COMING TO PLAY FOR YOU IN HOUSTON THIS YEAR? [CATHY]: WHAT? YOU MEAN WE'RE MOVING TO TEXAS? [SCOFFS] I DON'T BELIEVE THIS! DAD, IS THERE ANY MINOR HOCKEY DOWN THERE AT ALL? WE'LL SORT THAT OUT, SON. WELL, WHAT DO MY NEW TEAMMATES SAY? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE OLD MAN LINING UP ALONGSIDE YOU THIS YEAR? YEAH. YEAH. SURE, DAD. IF YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I DO. MARK, WHAT ABOUT YOU? YEAH. YEAH, SURE, DAD. YEAH. WELL, THAT'S A POSITIVE ANSWER. IS ANYONE HERE EXCITED ABOUT THE FIRST FATHER-AND-SON TEAM EVER? HELL, YEAH. YEAH. NICE, BILLY. HARV. ALL RIGHT, THEN, LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN. MARK, I'M WORRIED ABOUT DAD PLAYING AGAIN. I MEAN, FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, THEY REALLY KNOW HOW TO GOON IT UP IN THE WHA. [CATHY]: HEY, MARTY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA ASK FOR IN YOUR CONTRACT? SOME LAME-O CAR? SHUT UP, CATHY. YOU SHUT UP. I'M THE ONE'S GOTTA MOVE HERE TO TEXAS 'CAUSE OF YOU TWO. I'M SERIOUS. I THINK HE COULD GET REALLY HURT. HURT? HE COULD GET KILLED. HE'S 45, MARTY. SO, WHAT DO WE DO? I DON'T KNOW. HE'S SO EXCITED ABOUT IT. LISTEN TO YOU TWO. YOU'RE AFRAID OF PLAYING WITH HIM. YOU KNEW YOU'D BE COMPARED TO DAD IF YOU WERE STUPID ENOUGH TO PLAY HOCKEY, WHICH APPARENTLY YOU ARE. HEY! STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT! NO! STOP IT! [SHRIEKING IN PROTEST] [BROTHERS LAUGHING] YOUR TURN, MUZZ! NOT COOL, GUYS! I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING! YOU WERE THINKING IT! THANK YOU. AH, THANK YOU, JIM. YOU ARE YOUNGER THAN MOST OF THE HOCKEY GMs I'M USED TO DEALING WITH. WELL, I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT, MRS. HOWE. COLLEEN, PLEASE. HMM. SO... WE HAVE A MARKETING DREAM HERE. THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME COMING BACK TO PLAY WITH HIS SONS. I KNOW THE BOBBY HULL SIGNING PUT THE WHA ON THE MAP, BUT... THIS IS BIGGER. JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, HOW MUCH DID BOBBY MAKE LAST YEAR? HULL IS 33, YOUR HUSBAND IS 45. OH, I KNOW, BUT AGE IS AN ATTITUDE, JIM. PLUS, WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN THE RISK TO MY HUSBAND, GIVING UP A GUARANTEED CAREER WITH THE RED WINGS TO COME AND HELP YOU SUPPORT YOUR BRAND-NEW LEAGUE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW MUCH IS ALL THAT WORTH TO YOU? I DON'T KNOW, COLLEEN, BUT I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME. I HAVE AN IDEA. WHY DON'T WE EACH WRITE DOWN A NUMBER, JUST KIND OF SEE WHERE WE'RE AT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? ALL RIGHT. OKAY. THANK YOU. YOURS IS A LOT HIGHER, COLLEEN. I CAN'T DO SPOT DUTY, FOXY. IF I'M COMING BACK, I'M COMING BACK TO PLAY. UNDERSTOOD. NOW, WHAT ABOUT THIS HOUSTON OWNER? CAN WE TRUST HIM? HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT, BUT WE GOT GOOD LOCAL OWNERSHIP COMING IN. OH, LORDY. ARE THE CHECKS GONNA CASH? YOURS WILL. MINE? I DON'T KNOW. I SPENT 25 YEARS BUILDING MY REPUTATION. I'M PUTTING ALL THAT ON THE LINE HERE. NOW, YOU HAD MY BACK AS A TEAMMATE. DO YOU STILL HAVE IT? YOU KNOW I DO, GORDIE. [REPORTERS CLAMORING] OVER HERE, MR. HOWE! [NEWS REPORT]: MR. HOCKEY IS LEAVING DETROIT. GORDIE HOWE IS COMING OUT OF RETIREMENT AT AGE 45 TO STRAP ON THE BLADES... NOT FOR HIS RED WINGS, BUT TO LINE UP ALONGSIDE HIS SONS, MARTY AND MARK HOWE, AS A HOUSTON AERO IN THE NEW WORLD HOCKEY ASSOCIATION-- ALL OF THEM. TAKE THEM ALL DOWN! [RADIO INTERVIEW]: IS THIS SOME KIND OF PUBLICITY STUNT? [COMMENTATOR]: IS IT A STUNT? HONESTLY, I CAN'T SEE GORDIE HOWE DOING THAT. BUT HOW DESPERATE MUST THIS NEW LEAGUE BE TO SIGN A RETIRED 45-YEAR-OLD PLAYER AND TWO UNDER-AGED KIDS? [♪♪] [FLASHBULB POPS] [QUIET CHATTING] ARE YOU SERIOUS? TOSS ME THAT? I'M MARTY HOWE. JOHN. I, UH... I GOTTA SAY, IT'S AN HONOR TO BE PLAYING WITH YOU, GORDIE. WELL, THANK YOU, STAN, BUT YOU'RE PLAYING AGAINST ME TILL I MAKE THE TEAM. [DOOR SQUEAKS OPENS] HEY, NEW GUYS!

HE MAY NOT EVEN MAKE THE TEAM. [SNORING] [SIGHS HEAVILY] I THINK I'VE MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? FOXY DOESN'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THE LINE-UP. YOU NEED TO LET ME KNOW WHEN IT'S TIME TO CALL IT QUITS. OKAY? SO, I HEAR I'M NOT GONNA MAKE YOUR TEAM. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO TWO PRACTICES A DAY. YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT? OH, YEAH. OR MAYBE I'LL JUST DIE. YOU STILL GOT MY BACK, FOXY? YEAH. LAST I HEARD, HOCKEY'S A TEAM SPORT, THOUGH, GORDIE. YOU'RE AN EASY ONE TO HATE. OH! [SMACKS HAND] THE BANANAS ARE FOR YOU, HONEY. WHOA!

[CHUCKLES] WHY DON'T YOU TRY SHOVELING A LITTLE SUGAR ALONG WITH THE SAND AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS? GEEZ, GORD, THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD SHIFT. THAT'S LITTLE ENOUGH. DON'T WORRY, YOU MADE IT. THE BOYS ARE GONNA MAKE IT, TOO. OKAY! LET'S PLAY SOME HOCKEY! I'M GONNA STAPLE YOU THIS TIME, STANNY. THANKS FOR THE TIPS, MR. HARVEY. HEY, ANYTIME, KID. I'LL TEACH YOU WHATEVER I CAN REMEMBER.

I KNOW IT'S ONLY AN EXHIBITION GAME, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE PLAYING AGAINST BOBBY HULL TONIGHT. YOU'LL BELIEVE IT WHEN HE DEKES YOU OUT OF YOUR SKATES. HULL CAN BEAT YOU FORE AND BACKHAND, AND HE'S TOO STRONG TO KNOCK OFF THE PUCK. DO YOU GUYS ALWAYS HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOCKEY? IT'S JUST FIGURE SKATING WITH TWIGS, YOU KNOW? WHERE'D YOU GET THAT CRAP FROM? TOMMY. WHO'S TOMMY? A FRIEND AT SCHOOL. HE PLAYS FOOTBALL. I'D LIKE TO MEET THIS TOMMY. I'M SURE YOU WOULD, DAD. YOU SHOULD JUST BE HAPPY THAT SHE'S MET A FRIEND.

I KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT LINE, YOU KNOW? I HAD NOTHING GROWING UP, AND NOW THESE BOYS ARE GETTING PAID THESE HUGE SALARIES AT 18, 19? I JUST, I WORRY THAT IT'S TOO MUCH, YOU KNOW, TOO SOON FOR THEM. AH, GIVE THEM SOME CREDIT. HELL, GIVE ME SOME CREDIT, TOO. WE RAISED THEM RIGHT. TRUST THEM. YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT, AS PER USUAL. [CHUCKLES] YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A... PRETTY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, COLLEEN HOWE. STOP... I WAS PRETTY LUCKY THE DAY I MET YOU. I WILL NOT STOP. THAT NEEDS TO BE SAID.

BREAK IT UP, BREAK IT UP. GO TO THE BOX. COOL IT, 15. ALL RIGHT. GORDIE, I THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL. YOU CAN'T BE FIGHTING OUR BATTLES FOR US! I DIDN'T SIGN NO CONTRACT. [PLAYER TAUNTING] SHUT UP! FIGHT SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE! IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION. OTHER TEAMS SEE WHAT WE DID, THEY'LL GIVE US MORE ROOM OUT THERE. YOU NEED TO START THINKING LIKE A PRO. PLAY HOCKEY RELIGIOUSLY. IT'S BETTER TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE. TWO TEAMS! [CALL RINGING] HELLO? [SLAMS PHONE DOWN] WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? SMOKEY. [LAUGHS] ALL RIGHT, SO, A TEAM CAN BE PUT OFFSIDE IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE, THE PLAYER CROSSES THE OPPOSING TEAM'S BLUE LINE BEFORE THE PUCK DOES. OR TWO, THE PUCK CROSSES FROM INSIDE THE BLUE LINE AND OUT OVER THE CENTER RED LINE. CLEAR AS MUD? ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ICING RULES? YEAH? I LOOKED IT UP IN THE RECORDS, AND GORDIE'S NEVER GONE EIGHT GAMES WITHOUT SCORING A GOAL BEFORE. WHEN DO YOU THINK THIS DROUGHT WILL END? WELL, YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT DROUGHTS HERE IN TEXAS, RIGHT? THEY PASS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT ICING, SHALL WE? [LOUD PARTY MUSIC BLARES] [♪♪] HEY, MARTY! GAME'S ON CHANNEL 12! HEY! HEY!

THEY'RE ONLY SITTING FOUR POINTS BEHIND US. AND HOW ABOUT THAT GORDIE HOWE? MR. HOCKEY HAS BEEN ON FIRE SINCE HE SCORED THAT FIRST GOAL AGAINST NEW ENGLAND. I CALL GORDIE "THE AGELESS WONDER." IF HE KEEPS THIS UP, HE'LL BE CHARGING RIGHT AT THE SCORING CHAMPIONSHIP. OF COURSE, HE IS ONLY 45. [CHUCKLING] [CROWD BOOING AND JEERING] YOU'RE A DIRTY OLD MAN, HOWE! I'LL TAKE YOU ON! I'LL TAKE YOU ALL ON! I THOUGHT MINNESOTA WAS THE FRIENDLY SWEDISH STATE. BOYS, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A HAIRCUT? IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR A TRIM, ISN'T IT? DON'T LOOK AT ME. YOU TWO DON'T WANT MY PROTECTION. [♪♪] [RADIO SHOW CALLER]: I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WELL THE OLD GUY'S PLAYING OUT THERE. I'M TELLING YOU, GORDIE'S PLAYING BETTER THAN HE DID WITH THE RED WINGS BACK IN THE MID-'60s. HE'S DOMINATING THE ICE! [RADIO HOST]: I'VE GOT TO AGREE WITH YOU, FRIEND. [CALLER]: AND WHAT AMAZES ME IS THAT HOWE'S DOING IT WITH THESE KIDS. I MEAN, DOES THE YOUNG ONE EVEN SHAVE YET? [HOST]: LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THOSE KIDS CAN REALLY PLAY. MARK MAY NOT SHAVE YET, BUT I THINK HE'S A SHOE-IN FOR ROOKIE OF THE YEAR. NEXT CALLER. LOOKIN' GOOD. WHO THE HECK GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO TALK TO THE WHA OWNERS? THEY WERE MERELY INFORMAL CONVERSATIONS, NOTHING MORE. ABOUT A MERGER WITH THE NHL? THAT WAS PART OF IT, YES-- OVER MY DEAD BODY. MERGER... OUR REVENUES ARE DOWN, AND THE WHA IS TURNING INTO A SERIOUS DRAW, BRUCE! IT'S A LEAGUE OF HAS-BEENS AND NEVER-GONNA-BE'S! IF YOU WANNA KEEP YOUR JOB HERE, I'D SHUT UP NOW! YOU DON'T NEED TO WRITE THAT LAST SENTENCE DOWN. PRESIDENT CAMPBELL WILL GET THE GIST. THE LIGHTS ARE OUT. [TEAMMATES LAUGHING] [BOYS SHOUTING IN ALARM] WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? [SMOKEY]: HEY, WE GOT YOU, JUNIOR. [CACKLING] RELAX, ROOKIE. TODAY, YOU BECOME A MAN, OR AT LEAST A HOUSTON AERO! [LAUGHTER] MARK GOT ANOTHER MIGRAINE? YEAH. I CLOSED THE BLINDS SO HE COULD SLEEP. HE'S TICKED AT HIS TEAMMATES, ISN'T HE? I AM. HOW COULD YOU LET THAT HAPPEN? WAIT A SECOND, YOU'RE THE ONE TELLING ME I SHOULDN'T BE THE BOYS' CHAPERONE. IT IS BARBARIC. YEAH. YEAH, IT'S OLD-SCHOOL STUPID, IT'S EVEN OLDER-SCHOOL THAN ME, BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING. THEIR TEAMMATES WANT TO KNOW IF THEY CAN TRUST THE BOYS. TRUST THEM? THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. THERE IS TWO TYPES OF HOCKEY PLAYER, COLLEEN, THERE IS THE THIN-SKINNED AND THE THICK-SKINNED, THE ONES WHO TURTLE, AND THE ONES WHO FIGHT BACK. [SIGHS IN FRUSTRATION] AND THEY'RE ASKING WHICH ONE THE BOYS ARE. WELL, I STILL DON'T APPROVE, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE WHEN MY BOYS GIVE THEM THEIR ANSWER. [LAUGHTER] [MOCK SOBBING] AW, COACH, DON'T MAKE ME SKATE! AW, IT HURTS! IT HURTS SO BAD! [LAUGHS] [CACKLING] HOLY-- [YELPS IN ALARM] [LAUGHTER] GET 'EM OFF! GET 'EM OFF! [LAUGHTER] DOES IT HURT, SMOKEY? DOES IT HURT SO... BAD? [LAUGHTER] GOOD ONE, KID, GOOD ONE. NOW I GOTTA BURN THE BAG. [CHRISTMAS CAROLS PLAY] [YOUNG MAN]:...YEAH, I WOULD LOVE THAT. [CATHY]: TONIGHT WAS REALLY FUN. YEAH, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. OH, ANY TIME. [SLAMS DOOR] [GASPING] HI, DAD! THIS MUST BE TOMMY. YES. I HEAR YOU DON'T THINK TOO MUCH OF HOCKEY. WELL, I-I NEVER SEEN IT, SIR. WELL, INVITE HIM TO A GAME SOME TIME, CATHY. AND, UM, BE INSIDE IN FIVE MINUTES, OR THE YOUNG MAN GETS A DATE WITH THE ELBOWS. SO EMBARRASSING. [WHISPERING] WOW...

[CALLER]: I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A FATHER-SON TEAMMATE COMBO IN ANY PROFESSIONAL SPORT, HAS THERE? WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? DON'T LET IT GO TO YOUR HEAD, OKAY, HONEY? IT DOES NOT SAY "GORIDE" HOWE. YOU'RE UP THERE, TOO, MISSUS. [MARTY]: UH-OH. HERE COMES TROUBLE. CATHY AND HER NEW FRIEND. [CATHY]: WHOO-HOO! TEXAS FOREVER! WHOO! SHE LOOKS PRETTY HAPPY HERE. YEAH.

HE'S BEEN DRINKING. WHAT? I GUESS HE'S FALLEN OFF THE WAGON. FOXY'S BEEN COVERING IT UP, GETTING HIM SOBERED UP FOR GAMES. I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE MARY OUT FOR SUPPER BEFORE-- WELL, I'M SORRY, IT CAN'T BE HELPED, OKAY? I GOTTA... IT'S A TEAM THING. I UNDERSTAND. I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, OKAY? I PROMISE. LET'S GO. [COLLEEN]: SORRY, MARY. COMES WITH DATING A HOCKEY PLAYER. MR. HARVEY? HEY, KID, SIT DOWN. JJ, A BEER FOR MY YOUNG PROTEGE HERE. MR. HARVEY, WE GOTTA GET YOU TO THE SAM HOUSTON. IT'S ALMOST GAME TIME. WHY? I'M NOT PLAYING. HARV, FOXY SENT ME. WE GOTTA GET YOU SOBERED UP. DON'T LECTURE ME ABOUT SOBER, YOU LITTLE SNOT! PLEASE, HARV, JUST... JUST COME WITH ME, OKAY? [SIGHS] I'LL BE IN THE CAR. YOU SEEM PRETTY PLEASED WITH YOURSELF. I'M READING HERE, PLEASE. [SMACKS TABLE ANGRILY] GORDIE? [MARK STRUMMING GUITAR] WHAT THE HECK IS THIS? "I KNEW MY DAD WAS AN OLD MAN, I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A DIRTY OLD MAN TOO." DAD, WHAT'S WRONG? IT WAS A JOKE. A JOKE? WHAT THE HECK KIND OF THING IS THAT TO SAY ABOUT YOUR FATHER? I WAS JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE REPORTER HOW YOU PLAY WITH AN EDGE, AND-- I PLAY DIRTY? IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HOW I PLAY. I'M A GOSH-DANG POLICEMAN OUT THERE! DAD, COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU CROSS THE LINE SOMETIMES. I CROSS THE LINE? THERE IS NO LINE! IF YOU LET THEM THROW DIRT AT YOU, THEY WILL KEEP DOING IT! NOW, YOU APOLOGIZE. RIGHT NOW. HOW ABOUT ALL THE STUFF THAT YOU AND MOM TRY TO TEACH ME? LIKE, "BE HUMBLE, KID," "THE MEEK INHERIT THE EARTH, SON." DO I JUST THROW ALL THAT DIRT OUT NOW? THE MEEK MIGHT INHERIT THE EARTH. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE ICE! YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO YOUR FATHER. NOW. I DON'T KNOW, MOM, IF I LET PEOPLE THROW DIRT, THEY'LL JUST KEEP THROWING IT. NOW. THAT WAS A GREAT COVER STORY, GORDIE. WAS IT? I DIDN'T FINISH IT. YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S GOTTA RUN US DOWN. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. [GORDIE]: WHAT'S TEDDY GOT TO SAY NOW? SOME B.S. ABOUT HOW WE CAN'T BE MUCH OF A HOCKEY LEAGUE IF WE'VE GOT A 45-YEAR-OLD AS OUR LEADING SCORER. [SMOKEY CACKLING] MARKY, GREAT QUOTE IN THE SPORTS MAG, BUDDY! FREAKIN' HILARIOUS! WHAT DID HE SAY, SMOKEY? I JUST READ IT IN THE CAN. HE SAID, "I ALWAYS KNEW MY DAD WAS AN OLD MAN, I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A DIRTY OLD MAN." [LAUGHTER] DIRTY OLD MAN... [CROWD CHEERING] IT'S LIKE FOOTBALL WITH SPEARS! [WHISTLE BLOWS] COME ON, GORDIE. TO THE BOX, GORD! TO THE BOX, TO THE BOX! IN THE BOX, IN THE BOX. YEAH, NOW THE REFS ARE PROTECTING YOU, HUH, GORD? CHEAP SHOT, MAN. NOT A WORD. YOU GUYS SEEN HARV TONIGHT? NO. ANYONE? [COLLEEN CLEARS HER THROAT] [LOUDER] AHEM. [SHARP KICK] WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS MY FATHER HAS A GREAT SENSE OF JUSTICE ON THE ICE. HE'S A POLICEMAN OUT THERE, LIKE... DIRTY HARRY. [MUFFLED LAUGHTER] IS THAT YOUR VERSION OF AN APOLOGY? YEAH. ACCEPTED. [COLLEEN SIGHS] CAN I GET ANY MORE EGGS FOR ANYONE? - YEAH, SURE, MOM. - OKAY.

[BREATHING HARD] YOU SO DO. [STICKS SLAPPING] FACEOFF WON BY THE WHALERS. GOES BACK TO SELLWOOD AT THE POINT. SELLWOOD LOOKING FOR A SHOT ON NET, THIS GUY CAN REALLY BOOM IT. HOWE GOES DOWN TO BLOCK THE SHOT! OOH, THAT'S GOTTA HURT! [WHISTLE BLASTS] GORDIE HOWE IS DOWN ON THE ICE AND GRIMACING WITH PAIN. THE TRAINER BOBBY BROWN COMES OFF THE BENCH TO HELP HIM-- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, BOB. HE SAYS YOU GOT A HAIRLINE FRACTURE. YOU NEED TO KEEP WEIGHT OFF IT FOR 10 DAYS, AND YOU'LL NEED A CAST. NOT BAD. WELL, I'VE PLAYED WITH A HAIRLINE FRACTURE BEFORE. IT'S NOTHING, FOXY. YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO POINT. WE NEED YOU READY FOR THE PLAYOFFS. WHAT ABOUT THE SCORING CHAMPIONSHIP? WHAT ABOUT IT? THERE'S EIGHT GAMES LEFT. I'M ONLY SEVEN POINTS AHEAD OF WALTON. TELL SOMEONE WHO CARES, GORDIE. YOU KNOW I HATE TO LOSE. SO DO I. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT IN MY LINE-UP TILL THE PLAYOFFS.

POINT #101 FOR MIKE WALTON, WHO PASSES THE INJURED GORDIE HOWE IN SCORING. NOT A GREAT BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR MR. HOCKEY, WHO TURNED 46 TODAY. CATHY HAS YOUR CAKE READY. [SIGHS] SO, DO I LIGHT THE CANDLES OR NOT? SURE, ALL 146 OF THEM. YOUR DAUGHTER'S WAITING TO CELEBRATE YOUR BIRTHDAY WITH YOU. I'M NOT IN THE MOOD. OH, COME ON, GORDIE. BLOW OUT THE CANDLES. WISH FOR A NEW LEG. IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO WIN IT, COLLEEN. TO PROVE ALL THE NAYSAYERS WRONG. YOU KNOW, I CAME TO HOUSTON TO WATCH YOU PLAY HOCKEY WITH OUR SONS, TO TEACH THEM. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO TEACH THEM? YOU WON YOUR LAST STANLEY CUP IN 1955. [CHUCKLES RUEFULLY] WHAT DO YOU THINK ALL THE NAYSAYERS ARE GOING TO THINK? THEY PROBABLY THINK YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN. YOU HAVE WORKED SO HARD. NOW YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP WITH YOUR SONS. DO YOU EVER GET TIRED OF BEING RIGHT? [CHUCKLES] SO YOU WANT TO EAT THE CAKE, OR SHOULD I GIVE IT TO THE LAST TWO COWS? DO YOU THINK DAD SAW THE GAME TONIGHT? OBVIOUSLY. HE'S GONNA BE PEEVED. IT'S MR. NORRIS. WHAT DO WE DO? MR. NORRIS, HOW YOU DOING? BOYS. YOU MADE A BIG, BIG MISTAKE, YOU KNOW THAT? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO PLAY IN THE NHL NOW. YOU CAN THANK YOUR FATHER FOR THAT. WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG, MR. NORRIS, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT. WE GOT TO PLAY WITH THE GREATEST DETROIT RED WING EVER. IT WAS NICE SEEING Y'ALL. THAT WAS AWKWARD. YEAH, I KNOW. LATE FLIGHT? NO, WE GOT IN ON TIME. THE BOYS HAD A PARTY AT GRIFF'S. LAST CHANCE BEFORE THE PLAYOFFS. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU SIGN THOSE THINGS ALL MY LIFE, AND I STILL DON'T GET IT. I MEAN, WHY SIGN THEM AHEAD OF TIME? WELL... PEOPLE THAT WANT 'EM, IF YOU GET 'EM RIGHT AND READY FOR 'EM, IT GIVES YOU MORE TIME TO TALK TO THEM. THAT'S YOU, DAD. YOU KNOW, WE RAN INTO MR. NORRIS AT THE MINNESOTA AIRPORT TODAY. YEAH? DID HE TALK TO YOU? OH, YEAH. HE SAID WE'D NEVER PLAY IN THE NHL. YOU DON'T LISTEN TO THAT CRAP, SON. OKAY? MARTY SAID IT WAS WORTH IT 'CAUSE WE GOT TO PLAY WITH OUR OLD MAN. MARTY SAID THAT? YEAH.

THE LORD PLAYS SOME CRUEL TRICKS. [ANNOUNCER]: THE AEROS NEED TO TURN THINGS AROUND QUICKLY IF THEY HOPE TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT ROUND. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME GORDIE HOWE'S BEEN IN THIS SITUATION.

[LAUGHING AND CHEERING] [CROWD SCREAMING AND CHEERING] [SPORTSCASTER]: HOUSTON'S PARTYING EARLY TONIGHT WITH THE AEROS HOLDING A 3-0 LEAD OVER CHICAGO IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES. DARE WE USE THE WORD "SWEEP?" [COMMENTATOR]: WELL, THE FANS ARE, AND THEY JUST MIGHT BE RIGHT. [SPORTSCASTER]: WHAT DO YOU HEAR ABOUT A MERGER WITH THE NHL? THERE WERE A LOT OF RUMORS AROUND IT EARLIER IN THE YEAR. [COMMENTATOR]: I THINK THE OLD-GUARD OWNERS NIXED IT. NOT THAT THE FANS AT THE SAM HOUSTON GIVE A HOOT. THIS CITY HAS TAKEN THE GAME, THE TEAM, AND THE HOWE FAMILY TO HEART. HEY, FELLAS? UM... NOW, YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE DRESSING ROOM SPEECHES, MOSTLY 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY BAD AT THEM. THERE'S A FEW WORDS I'D LIKE TO SAY TO ALL OF YOU. UM, WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD, GROWING UP IN SASKATCHEWAN, I HAD A SCHOOLTEACHER, THE VERY FIRST HOCKEY COACH I EVER HAD. HER NAME WAS MRS. CRAWFORD. WAS SHE HOT? [CACKLES] UH, I WOULD SAY NOT, SMOKEY, BUT, UH, BUT SHE WAS REAL GOOD TO ME, AND SHE TAUGHT ME THE VERY FIRST RULE OF HOCKEY. SHE SAID, UH, "GORDIE, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME OUT THERE, THERE'S NO POINT IN PLAYING THE HOCKEY." A GOOD TIME. I HAD A REAL GOOD TIME PLAYING HOCKEY WITH YOU FELLAS THIS YEAR. THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST FUN I'VE EVER HAD PLAYING THE GAME. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL. THIS YEAR WAS SPECIAL. NOW, TO MAKE SURE I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN, LET'S GO WIN A CUP. [TEAM CHEERING IN EXCITEMENT] HERE WE GO, GUYS! [CHEERING AND SHOUTING ENCOURAGEMENTS] [ANNOUNCER]: IT'S A SWEEP. THE FANS ARE COUNTING DOWN THE FINAL FEW SECONDS. [FANS]: FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

I'M GONNA MISS HAVING YOU AROUND NEXT YEAR, OLD MAN. WHY? ARE YOU PLANNING ON RETIRING SOON? HUH? I'M GONNA GO SKATE WITH THE BOYS. ALL RIGHT. GO KISS YOUR MOM. THANK YOU. FOR THIS. MY PLEASURE. YOU'RE MY BEST TEAMMATE EVER, YOU KNOW THAT? I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE. WELL, I MEANT IT THEN, AND I MEAN IT EVEN MORE NOW. I'M GONNA START CALLING YOU "MRS. HOCKEY." [CHUCKLES] GO ON. GO SKATE. HEY, GORDIE, COME ON! [CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING AND SCREAMING] [♪♪] [REPORTERS CLAMOR] MR. NORRIS, MR. NORRIS! CAN WE GET A COMMENT ON GORDIE HOWE WINNING THE WHA CHAMPIONSHIP? NO. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HIM WINNING THE MVP AWARD AND HIS SON, MARK, WINNING ROOKIE OF THE YEAR? IT'S A BUSH LEAGUE. WHY WOULD I DIGNIFY IT WITH A COMMENT? WELL, HE DID PLAY HERE FOR 25 YEARS, SO IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE TALK OF A MERGER WITH THE WHA? NEVER. NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU THINK I'D LET THOSE BUMS IN MY BARN? [CLICKS OFF TAPE RECORDER] [ANNOUNCER]: WELCOME TO THE 1980 ALL-STAR GAME, COMING TO YOU FROM THE BEAUTIFUL NEW JOE LOUIS ARENA IN DOWNTOWN DETROIT. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] AND NUMBER 99, CENTER WAYNE GRETZKY. THIS IS THE FIRST ALL-STAR GAME SINCE THE MERGER WITH THE FORMER WHA CLUBS.

[ANNOUNCER]: DEFENCEMAN, NUMBER 28, REED LARSON. AND FROM THE HARTFORD WHALERS, REPRESENTING ALL OF HOCKEY WITH GREAT DISTINCTION FOR FIVE DECADES, NUMBER 9! [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING] [CROWD CHANTING] GORDIE! GORDIE! GORDIE! [CHANTING AND SCREAMING] [ANNOUNCER]: GORDIE HOWE, AN NHL ALL-STAR AT AGE 52. UNBELIEVABLE. THIS CROWD JUST WON'T STOP! [COMMENTATOR]: NO, AND I DON'T THINK THEY EVER WILL. I THINK MR. HOCKEY JUST CAME HOME FOR GOOD. [♪♪]
