You think you can control this? Huh? You didn't expect that, did ya? Huh? You wanna see me burn? Hm? Get out of my head. Get out of my fucking head! Ah! Ah! What am I doing here? I don't belong here. Man, in all his greatness creates machines that move bags, very slowly in circles, round and round. My new life begins. _ Hello? - Doctor Winter? - Dr.Clerk? Good to meet you finally. In the flesh, that is. Thank you, Paul. I'll show her. I'm Maureen. Everyone calls me Maur. - Marianne. - No nickname? - Mm... no. - Never had one? - No. - Hmm. It shows strength of character, you are who you are. Just.. Marianne. Right, let's show you your office, consulting room or whatever. Dr.Mandelbaum's sorry he couldn't be here himself, but... he had a family event that couldn't be avoided. But we were also happy you could come at such short notice. I have to say, we were delighted when you sent your application in, but you know that, anyway. Oh, how was your flight? Boring. Boring. Yeah, I suppose it was. Still, "how was your flight?" What people ask, isn't it? This is it. Oh, sorry about that. I will have a word with administration and have to get that changed. Okay. Oh, I have, um, put your case files out on the desk. You've got few hours before your first session, so I hope that's enough. I can't think why you'd come here from all that high life. I've never been to Upstate New York, but... I googled it, it looks wonderful. I was talking to my husband last night, um... is you American position still available? Maybe I should apply, we can do a straight swap. Oh, I think it's been filled already. Oh.. Shame. That means I'm stuck here, then. Seriously, though, why'd you decide to move to Scotland? I like rain. So, um.. I've got my first patient. Uh, Shall I pick you up at 12:30, show you the canteen? If you can survive that you can survive anything. Uh.. Yeah. That would be nice. - See you later. - Thank you. _ Corinna? It's okay for you to stare at the wall. We're gonna try something a bit different from Dr. McVittie. What do you think? Shall we... talk a little? You don't have to talk about your Mother being sick. We can... talk about anything. Anything at all. Hello. I'm Marianne Winter. Oh, hi. I'm Tina. Uh, this here is Manny. Hi, Manny. See you later. It's right here. What are you drawing, Manny? I'm... I'm not Dr. MacVittie. You don't have to be with me like you were with him. I won't tell you what to do. Now it's you who is in charge here. And... we will do what you want to do. Are you the pig, Manny? The... The lonely one, staring out? It's okay to talk. Sometimes, when we talk, we can be... less lonely. And if you talk, it doesn't mean you have to be nice to me. The pig doesn't have to make friends with other animals, if he doesn't want to. But, maybe he can say why he doesn't want any friends. No one likes what I say. Why not? Because of what I can do. What can you do? I make things happen. Like what? What can you make happen, Manny? You. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey! - Hey! I thought it was you. - Uh...? - Oh, I... Clinic administration. You filled in the form with me this morning. Of course, yeah. Sorry. No. Are you having a look around town? Yeah, I suppose. - You leaving? - Oh, yeah. You know me, I'm... I'm heading home. Kieran is off to his obscure book club. Don't ask, it's totally Kieran. - Book club? - Yeah, here. Here you go. _ Are you couple? Kieran? No, no. No, no. He is a free bird. Hm, well. Anyway, I'm off. I'll see you tomorrow. Right, yeah. You okay? Is it the rain? Is it too loud? Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to turn it off. Hello? Uh.. Maur.. Uh.. Can you call me back? I'm with Corinna. Uh.. Corinna? Yes. She is a good girl. She is a very good girl. But... Uh, no, she doesn't want to talk to me. But, I'll keep trying. Okay. Bye, bye. _ Can you tell me about this drawing? What is it? An accident. A car comes flying on the corner and hits the other one. Ka-boom. And did you read about it? Was it one the news? No. I made it happen. You saw it happen? In your mind? Do you see images? Or... maybe you hear things. You can tell me. It... It might help. Pretty scary, doesn't it? But if it wasn't for me you wouldn't be here. There is a gun in your drawer. That drawer? Only if you have a look. And why is there a gun in the drawer? I remember when she used to talk, she expressed anxiety about her mother. There was a time when she used to look up at the ceiling and say something like, um, "See mom, take mom away." Yes, her fantasies evolved around her anxiety that her Mom would eat her. We never discovered why. All of this has alluded to in Dr. Macvittie's notes, but not treated in any detail, thank you. Her step-father says that when the weather comes on TV she watches it carefully as if her life depends on it. I'm afraid, she has deteriorated over the last two years, the mutism and anorexia. - Relatively recent. - Hm. I'll think about it. Right... "Emmanuel Craig." Manny. A mystery. I'd like to get hold of his file from his former residence, Manchester. Here's a reference. Yeah, I'll see what I can do. Maybe that will shed some light, but, for the moment, I've got nothing to go on. My impression is that his world view is some kind of defense system, some kind of fortress. - He talks to you? - Yes, he does. You probably the only one. He doesn't talk to his foster Mother or anybody else as far as we know. Still, it would help if could have a look at the old MacVittie files. I'm missing the last two months of his notes. Yeah, well... We will look into that, yep. Anyway, you seem to be making great progress. I think, you have done a wonderful job under the circumstances. So, thank you, Marianne. Come on, that would do little good. They don't like sudden movements, so why won't they off! Oh! This is hell. Ah! Sinica smoke house. Yeah, but the GPS says left. Damn brakes again. So, you trust the sign or the GPS? Um... the sign, I guess. Uh-uh, kids could have - flipped it the wrong way around. - Oh! What else they got to do around here? Alright. Heads or tails? Heads. Schr√∂dinger wanted to prove how ridiculous this idea was and came up with the example of the cat in the box. So, before you have a look inside the box, the cat is both dead and not dead. Both realities exist at the same time. And this, for him, proved this whole idea is nonsense. Uh, but it's not. Because thoughts are energy, just like everything else. And they could manifest themselves in a manner that we create a reality about how we observe it. You know, "what we think we become." Doctor, what do you think? Oh, um.. Well, um... Our thoughts like self-fulfilling prophecies. That's how the way think about of world end up being our world. Uh... of course. Well, I'm a psychiatrist and, um... if there is anything I'm convinced about is that thought is the root of all sickness, all trouble. I... I mean, look at this book group, agonizing over Schrodinger's cat, and whether the process of observing reality actually changes nature? Don't we have better things to do with our lives? I mean, we all needs to see a shrink if we think this is a good way of spending an evening. So, if thought is our sickness, what is the cure? Oh, that's easy. I prescribe a full lobotomy for all of mankind. Hi. Hi. Uh... I live in Mannofield. So do I. Great. Oh, um.. Would you like a ride? That would be lovely. Thank you. I thought you'd never ask. Okay, let's do this backwards. Um... I say something, an answer, and then you ask the question that leads to that answer. Got it? What are the rules of the conversation? Very good. How am I at this game? I own a big shop, second hand. What do you do for a living? It's not bad. What's it like running a second hand book shop? It's a good way of making money. What do you think about prostitution? - Uh, next right. - Where do you want me to go now? Just here. Behind the red containers. Where did your neighbours find you the last time you had a good night out? Why don't you come up? Oh, um.. Sorry, I, uh.. - Uh... - That's okay. Uh, thanks for the lift. - This F... ing car. - Shh... - What? - He might hear you. - Who? - The car, of course. The light. The light, what does it mean? What does it mean? Engine temperature, I think. It's probably just... Oh, god. What did I tell you? He was listening. So, our car doesn't want us to get home today, huh? It wants us to have an adventure? _ _ _ _ _ Her fantasies evolved around the anxiety that her Mom would eat her. We never discovered why. _ Has... has somebody been in my room? Uh, no. I don't think so. I mean, Manny. Has Manny been in my room, maybe before his session or after? I think I would've noticed. - In my drawer... - Look, I'm really sorry, but can we do this tomorrow? It's just, I'm running really late. Thank you. Hey, your phone is ringing. Hello? I knew you did that. Who is this? You have to kill him before he kills you, you understand? You understand? Who? Hello? Who is this? _ _ It's the essential idea. - Shall we start? - Yeah. See, I don't know, I just feel like it was he himself a sick person. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Um... I'm going home. I have some stuff... to do. - Okay. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. It is a problem of how our decisions change the world in which we make those decisions. - Who wants to start? - Yeah, I'll give a go. Um, I think, the idea's always been there, Uh, change of mind. Like, back in childhood kids would always ask if they left the playground, would the playground still be there. That's the same thing with the tree that falls in the forest. You have a yacht? So revere. It's hardly a yacht. And it's my brother's. Well, you're just gonna look at her? Hop on. - You alright? - Yeah. Can you steer it for me? Give me your hand. It's alright. - Uh.. - Just hold on. Yeah? You know how these works? What do you mean? I've done this once before, but... Once? Are you tired? Oh, you should spend some time with my patients. Listen, I have to ask, um... You wearing a wedding ring. I should take it off. Engine trouble? Wanna ride? I can take you in to Steamburg. Greg will take care of you there. - He's got a tow truck. - Great. Thanks. Seneca smoke house! Best smoked ribs for miles around. We're all about the trout, actually. Well, then you should stay at the Steamburg motel. Then you can get there tomorrow, after your Jeep has been fixed. Hell, maybe even tonight. Look, I'll call Craig down at the gas station. Sir? Where is my husband? Sir? It was an accident. He died. My.. Husband? I... I came here to start a new life. Oh, Jesus. That's terrible. Ever since I got here, it all seems so unreal, like when I got on that plane I left one universe and entered another. Like it's slowly being erased. But I keep asking myself, what if... we were taken other turn? What if we hadn't decided to go on the trip? What if... we left a few minutes later? I just keep thinking... Don't think. That's where all the trouble begins, thinking. - I know there is no reason... - Don't... think. I've been sent here to stop you thinking. - Manchester Social Services. - Yeah? Emmanuel Craig confirmed transferred to Aberdeen for fostering after parents death, - but no further information on the file. - Oh, come on. There must be some record, on his background, - who his parents were, how they died. - No, yeah. You would have thought so. Would you check on it one more time? - Yeah, sure. Leave it to me. - Okay. Any other issues? Yes. I have a question. I got a phone call last week from some mysterious person, who seem to be in a highly anxious state. He told me I should kill someone. Is that just British eccentricity or should I be worried? Well, I's sorry Marianne, I think this is best ignored. If this person gets through to you again, please ask him to call me. Well, I think that's all for now. Thank you. I'm afraid, it must be Albert. Albert MacVittie, you predecessor. As you know, he had some problems. He was institutionalized some time ago. I heard about it. It's not a well kept secret. Yes, um... It's sad. It's a terrible thing. He is a close friend. Still, his final notes would be very helpful. Really, Marianne, these were written too much under the influence of his paranoia. It's best to make a fresh start with this patient. _ _ Emmanuel was discovered at home in a malnutrition ed state by the police, after his mother's body had been recovered. He was made a ward of the counsel. Jesus. _ _ I just wanted to come and see where you work. Yeah? Wow. - One in a million. - Hm? What? Isn't that a bit boring? Depressing? - Oh, um... - Yeah, well. That's all counsel ward, you know what I mean. All these panelings ripped out, you know, you need some nice bright walls. In... In... Ouch! You're vicious. - You need therapy. - Thank you. This just came into the shop and it made me think of you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Pleasure. What? How did you know? Know what? - This is my favorite book. - Very funny. - It is. - Is it? - Is it really? - It is. Oh, that's... I suppose, it's odd. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Why don't we take the boat out tomorrow? - Sure. - Yeah? I will take you to the Island Muck. - Muck? - Muck. That sounds very... Is the door locked? It's very naughty. You draw a lot of accidents, disasters, don't you, Manny? What interests you about disasters? What do you thinking of when you draw them? Did it scare you? The gun. I know it did. Well, I looked in the drawer, but I didn't find anything. - What are you drawing now? - I just want to make it happen. He's under water? Who's Kieran? The man with the messy hair. Is he swimming? No. He can't swim. Not this time. Shouldn't he be saved? No. MacVittie was obsessed by him. - He was? - Hm. Developed a more bit obsession about the boy. He spent a lot of time in the library, reading and researching. I don't know what he was after there. It's probably the first sign we noticed. It's so sad, really. I mean, MacVittie was an old grump maybe, but... he was a good person inside. Well, he certainly has wide research interests. It's just horrible. He work with a guy and then he get sectioned and the next thing you know he set fire to himself in the mental hospital roof. He what? _ _ _ _ _ _ "God is with us." - Doctor. - Hi. Can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah, yeah. Come in. So... how is he at home? Still the same. Very quite. He hasn't spoken to me yet. He has a tendency to draw these disasters, people dying. Do you think that's bad? They said drawing was good for him. I mean... it seems to have calmed him. I just wish he would speak to me. But then when I think about what he's been through and how his life changed so suddenly... The say his mother was a lovely woman. And quite religious, but very bright and lively. Before that. She was American, like you. You knew that? - His mother? Really? - Hm. Well, I'm not American. I just live there, since post-grad medical school. Look, I know this might sound strange, but do you know... Is there anyway Manny could have gotten hold of a gun? It was found in the consultation room. And I just... Of course, we don't know if it was Manny who put it there. What is going on? It's probably nothing. But we have to investigate. No, probably, Manny doesn't have anything to do with it. Please, don't mention it to him. Yeah, but... - Sorry. - Don't worry. Melissa? Why are you throwing things downstairs? Get into you room. I's trying to talk with doctor.Go. - Hello, Manny. - Don't be horrid. Why won't you show me the drawing? Are these one's here? What's in there? The future. Right. So you found the gun, after all. Well, why did you put it there, Manny? To frighten me? It was there because you found it. What do you mean? You made it real by looking, by opening that drawer. "Cat is dead and not dead." Right? Is that so? Okay. Now tell me, Manny. How did you do it? With the gun. Oh, you wanna play games? Tell me about the man, the man you drew today. How did you know his name? What do you know about me? Why did you call him Kieran, Manny? Why did you say he was drowning? You know, I can take all the drawing stuff away, and you'd have to answer me! How'd you know his name, Manny? - Now, talk to me! - Ah, ah! - No! Help, help! - Are you alright? It's alright, it's alright. What's going on? Sh... Sir? Have you seen Kieran? The guy from the yo-yo boat? I'm supposed to meet him here. No? Did you, maybe, see him go out sailing? No? Okay. Hi, It's Kieran. It might be difficult to call me for the next few days, so, leave a message, I will get back you you. Kieran, I have been waiting here for an hour for you. Could you please call me? It's fucking freezing here. Look, I'll wait another half hour, if you're not coming could you at least let me know? Okay. Bye. _ Hi, It's Kieran, It might be difficult to call me for the next few days, - I didn't disrespect you. - No. You just sat there nodding and smiling - as if it's okay. - They're professionals. It's their job... Turn down the damn music! What? What? Nothing. What are we doing today? Watching you. The way unpack, so inefficient. The number of times you cross the kitchen could be cut in half with a different system. Jesus. Well, I must put that on my list of things do to, "improve unpacking". Ever heard of eternal recurrence? It's where you try to do everything perfectly, even the small things, in case you condemn to repeat them eternally. Yeah, if that's true, I work on my tennis, if I were you. I repeat eternally, what are we doing today? I was gonna catch up with some work. Let's go for a picnic. - The Finger Lakes. - Oh! There will be crowded. Day trippers, geriatrics. Well, what about Elgin? Miles away. Yeah, but once we there, we can head west, towards Warren. That place of yours, you were always talking about, the... the smoke house. You made my day. He wanted to go... He wanted... Heads. The car. Damn car. It's God's country, ain't it? But, you got to look out for bears. They are everywhere. _ Kieran? Kieran, it's me! I thought it was biblical. Like in Genesis, when God drowns the world in anger. He offers Noah an olive branch, a symbol of peace. God is compassionate, - even in anger. - Sorry. Have you seen Kieran? I'm... I'm really... - I'm urgently looking for him. - No. But I think, Markus might know. - Okay, it's great. - Just wait a second. Hello? Kieran? But isn't that the point, the earthquake? He seems to punish both good and evil people equally. There is no guiding deity, - no god to judge. - That's to assume a simplistic view of God. The whole point about God is that he works in mysterious ways. Our duty is to do our best to follow his laws. But our benefit in the afterlife, events like the earthquake are like tests of faith. Are you serious? That's what I believe, yes. I didn't think adults still believe this stuff. He... hello? I mean, except those lunatics who fly planes into buildings. Oh, do you? Have you seen Kieran last couple of days? So, all this, everything, it's all planned, all controlled by your great God up there? Yes, He is the creator of all things. Kieran! And depending on what I do I might end up in eternal bliss or damned in hell! That's what I believe, yes. Kieran? Can I help you, Madam? - Do you live here? - No. My... boyfriend lives here. Then you had an arrangement to meet him here, did you? No. So, for you... we're all naughty school children being judged by this loving, punishing creator of wonders? Such lunatics! What's your home address, please? 13 F, Park-hill road. You've been listening to loud music this evening? I mean, if that's the case, I'd rather be a a..pig in-in-in shit! Or vegetable. And banging on doors here? Yet, might then I wouldn't care that I'm some kind of Marionette in some sadist fantasy! Have you had an argument with your boyfriend, Ma'am? No, It's... I'm just... I'm trying to... We're not marionettes. God gave us freewill. If this stories already been written how can the characters have freewill?! Uh, misunderstanding, perhaps? - Forget it. - We write the story. Then we are Gods! But no! Can I write my husband back to life? Can I? _ - I see you have found your way in. - I was looking for a phone number. And more, I suppose. Look, I'm so sorry. It is kind of an emergency. I received a phone call today from Mrs. Malacca, Manny's Foster mother. She told me that Manny was in a state of anxiety after you have visited him yesterday. And that you'd involved in some kind of tussle with your patient, trying to grab some drawings from him. I didn't want to believe it, but do you have some - private problems, Marianne? - No! - I'm fine. - Oh. Look, It's not my place to... to say anything about what to do outside of working hours as long as it doesn't influence your functioning here, but, um... I can smell the fragrance of alcohol on your breath from over here, Marianne. Maybe.. Maybe a short break would do you good. He is in number 10, on the left. Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me, miss. Excuse me, miss, can you open the door? - Excuse me, miss. - It's in the glass piano. A glass piano? Which glass piano, dear? Doctor? Dr. MacVittie? I'm Dr.Winter. I'm your successor at Victoria Clinic. Is it about him? I knew you would come and see me about him. As you know by now, he... control everything, even here. Uh, listen, there must be an explanation for all this. Can you remember? When was the first time he drew something terrible? What did he draw? Did... Did something particular happened that day? He's in my mouth. I can taste him. And the noises in your walls? Did he do the trick? The gun in the drawer? He did. Here. You have to kill him. Kill him. Kill him before he kills you. Or... Or you can... just put a bullet in your own head. It's the only way. Doctor? Please. Try to remember. Stay with the facts. When did he start drawing? What did he draw? No, fuck! MacVittie. Where did he go? I think he went down, to the left. Hi, It's Kieran. It might be difficult to call me for the next few days Kieran, don't go out of your boat. By no means, go out of your boat. It's dangerous. I have every reason to believe it's very dangerous, trust me. Call me and I'll explain. Bye. _ _ _ Manny's father? What's going on here? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Either he controls things or he simply foresees them, and draws what he sees, yes. That must be it. He only foresees them, remember. He knows things about me and draws them to frighten me. But I'm in control. Everything I do is determined by me, not by him. Turn on the engine. Turn off the engine. Turn it on again and drive 30 feet. Laugh. Say, I'm in control. I'm in control. Laugh again. I determine what I do, not that child. I'm in control. Get some sleep. Get some sleep. It'll be okay. Recess in the morning. Manny is just a boy. A child is just a child. He's just a child. Now, I have a quiet drink. Quiet. Quiet. And try to call Kieran. _ _ Hi, It's Kieran. It might be difficult to call me for the next few days, so, leave a message, I will get back you you. - What happened? - The boat was unmoored. Drifted off. Someone saw a strange woman messing with the boat. Police said it was his girlfriend. - The foreigner? - Aye. They're looking for her. There he is! Oh, god! What are you drawing, Manny? The worst thing in the world. What is the worst thing in the world? The future. I can destroy everything. Don't you remember being burned? How you died? You're nothing. When I leave the room you don't exist. You're just in my head! Can you get me out of your head? Black! Black, black! Black? I'll destroy the clinic, the hospital, the world, big people who put me in the dustbin! And what do you draw? My draw is real. - How is that? - I'm the only one who is real. I made everything. I decide when the bronze age would come. I am God, and you're God's doctor. And I'm going to put you in hospital and get a new doctor from far away. And then I'm going to kill her, and then I'm going to destroy everything! Everything! Ah, ah! No, no! Don't hurt him! Yah! - Why did you pick me? - No, no! Why did you kill him? - No! - Why! Why me? Why me? - I don't know! - Why me! Because I'm an unbeliever? No! How far back does it go? Did you kill my husband, too? Let me go home! So, you didn't plan this one, then? There are some things you don't control. - Like this! - Stop! So, you... So you believe me now? But you're too late. No, you're too late. - What do you want? - I want my life back, how it was. Police. Get out! She's got a gun! Uh.. What's your plan for me? Is this it? Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? Doctor Winter, my name is Inspector Blaine. Can you just send us a signal that you can hear me? I didn't control this. You made this happen. You decided to find the gun. You went out looking for the the drawings. - You decided to bring me here. - So, now it's my fault? Right? So, it's my decision whether I shoot you. Hm? I'll make you a deal. Give me my life back and I won't do it. Give me my life back! Dr.Winter. Please send us a sign that you can hear us. Dr.Winter, please don't use the gun. Put the gun away. If you don't want to show yourself, please just waive from the window. Which life? Bring him out here, you mad bitch! Take her back to the car! We want you to show the child, show that he's unharmed. This isn't my life. I don't do mad things like this. You made me do this! Now, you're gonna have to make me good again. You controlled me! - Dr. Winter... - Now you sort it out! We're waiting for the boy. But I'm only a child. Please, show us the boy, you've got 10 seconds to show us the boy. I'm only an ickle, ickle boy. Then when I shoot you you die? - Yes. - Ten. - I'll die. - Nine! - Or when you shoot - Eight. - Everything will seize ti exist. - Seven... six. - Everything. - Five! Four! Three! - I know you won't shoot. - Two! My husband? Where is my husband? God, God. Please God, bring my husband okay. Save my husband and I will believe in you. I will worship you. I will. - I'll have faith. - Ma'am? I will have faith. Please, God. Please. Ma'am? Can you hear me? Josh? You've had a bad concussion. Your arm is broken, but you're okay. Marianne... - You? - Nothing but a few cuts. Like a miracle. I was lean back towards you then airbag pressed me down. That guy, the driver, he died. I think I will go back to work on Monday. - So soon? - Yeah. - Woo-hoo! - Welcome back! Well, I should have near fatal accidents more often. Very funny. Thank you. It's very sweet. Welcome back, dear. Aw-paw. - Look what the kids did. - Oh, that's so cute. You know what I was thinking about, for a summer vacation? I was thinking about Scotland. Scotland? Great. I'll walk in the mountains, but... - what will you do? - We're already had a vacation at the beach and I wanted to cheer you up after the accident, so. Let's go somewhere wet and gloomy this time, okay? I've been thinking about our disagreement. I don't want to talk about it. Why not? I don't want to have an argument now. What makes you think there will be an argument? Are you serious? Are you serious? Only two, I promise. A girl and a boy. Whatever you want. What made you change your mind? The accident. Uh... Come on, you win anyway. Yeah. I just... Um... _ What? Nothing. What is it? We have been to Scotland before. We have? - When? - I had this dream, it didn't feel like a dream. I was in Scotland and you were dead. Thanks. There was this boy. A boy? You mean, our son? A patient of mine, I think. Mh... tell me about it in the morning. I'm just... I'm just gonna... _ I had this incredibly vivid, detailed dream last night like I've never had before. It was amazing. Just like a total world system, like, created in my head. There was this boy, a patient of mine or something, and he controlled reality. Basically, he was god. He created everything. He created me, this clinic, this kind of version of Scotland, Aberdeen, whatever. I've never been to Scotland, but it was incredibly realistic, detailed place with like street names and, well, phone numbers. I knew my boyfriend's phone number, for Christ-sakes. In the dream. And this boy who was my patient, he created me and this world and everything, like a God, as some kind of test. And then it got very scary as I had to prove that he was wrong, that this child who thought he was God wasn't God. I had to shoot him, which is when I woke up. - Sounds intense. - It was so incredibly real. Are you okay? I'm fine. What do you mean by that? Maybe you came back to work a bit too quickly. Everyone is so pissed off that I'm happy for it. - Marianne? - Like if I'm not grumpy or negative there must be something wrong with me. It was just a dream for Christ sake. Do you believe in alternative universes? Is one universe not enough for you? That dream I had, that Scottish life I saw. What if that is the real life? And that boy created this here like a game, as some kind of test? There was a test in the dream. I can't remember what it was. - It's just a thought. - It's a silly thought. And you've never been to Scotland. In this universe. Marianne, stop thinking about this, please. Focus on what is here, now. My lecture went really well, by the way. Thank you for asking. - Students even applauded. - Great. What if I call him? - What, the boy? - No. This Kieran. The man I... Baby, It's not about him. It's about knowing. Hello? - Hello? - Is it you? Who is there? You... Your name? Tell me your name. What? It's... It's Marianne. Who? Marianne Winter. Who is Marianne? Who is this? Marianne? What are you doing? I'm going to Scotland. - I have to go. - What are you talking about? Marianne? This is crazy. Hey! Hey! Marianne? Marianne! But you know about this patient. Maur. Maur is your nickname, right? We talked about him many times in the staff meeting. He suffered from severe trauma, he drew. He drew pictures continuously. Look, I know this place. I know you! I know what I'm talking about. What about Dr. MacVittie? Albert MacVittie, the doctor who was sectioned. He... He jumped off the roof. He set himself on fire. Okay, okay, come on. Let's just check the files - and see if... - Madam. We've never heard of this patient. Please. Apart from the fact that we're not allowed to give names or details of a patient, so could you please leave the building, now? - You need hand, Pete? - No, no. It's alright. She's just leaving. You need to leave the building. Fine. Sure. Okay. Clever-clever. You've got it right. Right? I was all a test. But you failed it, so I decided to give you one more chance. I've decided to let you remember. Open it. Have a look. Then you will know everything. Don't you want to know what happens next? What would it matter? It's already in there. - It's all been fixed. - No. Just like the drawings I found before. It would change everything. See, the drawings would never have existed without you finding them. Only if you have a look. Remember? It was your decision, like you decided to call him. Oops! So, that was your fault, after all. He was awoken by a phone call in the middle of the night and then slipped down the stairs. Bang-bang-bang. Banged his little head. No! What do you want from me? To go home and live my life in fear, one day you would take it all away again? You wanted him back, - didn't you? - Please. Go away. Please. Make me unaware that you exist. Please. _ Hello? Marianne... you have to come home. Did you see the news? There was a freak storm up here, a hundred miles in hour wind and lots of accidents. The roof collapsed. And Marianne.. Josh... we don't know where he is. Please, don't do this to me. Please. Please, save him. Please, help me. Please. Please. Leave me alone! Manny! Manny! What do you want? You've had your test. Wasn't that enough? Please. Please, just go away. Please. Leave me alone. You need me! Is that it? No. You-need-me. This isn't about me, is it? It's about you. This is all you. _ I've had a breakthrough. It took me a while to work it out. Why do we destroy the one we need? Because we don't want to be helped. Because he's frightened. Very frightened Life used to be so wonderful like a dream. It must have been an awful shock for him, the night his father died. One day divides happiness from hell. One event. One choice. And then six months later, his mother was gone too. He must have blamed himself. Could he have saved her? Was it all his fault? Why did this happened to him? Why did God take away his parents? And so, he shut himself off, refused to speak. It must have been a terrible experience for him. Quite threatening. All of these questions and the guilt, the shock, fear. To deal with all this he found a way out, a way to exile his fear and suffering. He escaped into a world in which he has full control, a world where he is God. See? I don't exist. You don't exist. In fact, none of these is real. We all exist in the mind of a 10 year old boy. Am I right, Manny? I know you're out there. I know you're listening. _ Hey. Are you alright? What's up? You can tell me. I want you to know you can always tell me. Just get my hand and pinch me if you want to say something. I know what's going on inside you, Manny. I'm the voice inside you head. I can feel your yearning. You don't want to live in this nightmare anymore. I can help you. How? Because I believe in you. Because I know one day... you'll come out of your silent, empty fortress and enter this world. - The world? - I know. It's so huge and frighting. But, Manny, it's also so full of light. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Just, imagine it to be different and the world will be a better place. Hey, sweetheart. Hey. Transcript & Subtitled by Primus V
