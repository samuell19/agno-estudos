I'm sick of it, sis. I can't breathe here. What is up with you? Cheryl, calm down. No! No, they... they look at you like you're worthless! They make you stand there and wait, like you're some sort of reprobate or something. Like you're shit on the sole of their shoe! Who makes you wait? You're not making any sense. Is this... one of your dips? The housing office! I was down there earlier asking for help with the rent. You've got a job! You and Michael need to stop living fancy off those credit cards. I won Saleswoman of the Year three times in a row! I shouldn't be where I am now! Carl! Go check on your sister. I want more. Is it wrong to want more? We all want more, Cheryl. But we're dealt the cards we're dealt. You've... just... gotta... make the most of things. Now, what time you popping round later? Yeah. Yeah, you're right. "The most of things." Just having a low day. Bit of a dip. I'll see you at five, yeah? Hello. Your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone. Hello. Your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone. Cheryl, where are you? Answer the goddamn phone. Wonderful morning, isn't it? Oh. - Wonderful morning. - Wonderful morning, isn't it? Wonderful morning, isn't it? Isn't it just? And you're looking just divine, as usual. Charmer. You coming to my charity gala this Friday? We're opening up the doors. Ooh! Exciting! Disability. In the Gambia. - Sounds splendid. - Shall I put you down for 500? - Pounds? - Yes, unless... Oh... no, of course. 550 even. Happy to help. So kind. Well, can't we add more? We want a full house. I work in insurance, hon, not hospitality. This is important, Ian. These things carry weight in the community. I've been working towards this for so long. Okay. Okay, I'll get it done. And don't forget the langoustines. Hello, Neve! - How's she getting on? - Oh, she's a treat. A right little worker bee. Isn't she just? What's happened to your hair, darling? It's a style. Right. Trends are always changing, aren't they? They are indeed. Will you be wanting anything for your event? Mary's been telling me all about it. A signed choir? Oh, yes. The Dream of Gerontius by Elgar. The journey of a dead man's soul. Sounds marvelous. I'll pick up some expensive shampoo later and run you a nice bath. A little pamper party. When you came here, you didn't even know what a village fête was. Now look at you. Throwing your very own gala! - Well, you must've inspired me. - I'd like to think so. We're all so proud. You're a real example of fortitude, Neve. I understand the impulse to want to give back. It's not just giving back. It's bringing it all together, my time here. A graduation of sorts. And an opportunity to show off the new kitchen. Well, that too, obviously. But, Neve, really, come on, there's nothing to prove here. - You're practically one of us. - "Practically"? You know what I mean. And you are drop-dead gorgeous. You haven't aged a bit. It's actually quite infuriating. - I'm getting it. - I'm so sorry. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Gotta go to the loo. Without the service. Thank you. Need help with anything in there, sweetheart? I'm fine. You wouldn't believe what happened to me today. In the car. - Anyone seen my poster? - What poster? Ian. The Lil Wayne one? In the gym? - Your mum's telling a story. - It's just disappeared, then? So, yes, I'd just had tea with Amanda, and I... - No phones at the table, Mary. - Sorry. So I'm driving along, when I see someone dodgy from out of town, and... ...you wouldn't believe straight into the back of Sonia's car. Near tore off her entire bumper. - Send her over. - You'll sort it? - Course. - Thank you, darling. - Cute. - Gross. We just hired a girl from out of town. Oh, really? What girl? A lovely young Black girl. Mm. Black? - Well, we're Black. - Yeah. What was her name? This girl? Abigail. She's quite charming indeed. Hm. Your hidden skills. Told you before. It was a side job for a bit when I was 15. Down in Catford? - Up in Fulham. - Was it? "Was it?" indeed. Do you think Sebastian's okay? Why wouldn't he be? Are we giving him enough space to, I dunno... - What? - Express himself. Sebastian has everything he needs. Speaking of which, I just pre-ordered him the new Xbox for his birthday. What's wrong with the one he has? Oh, Neve. You don't have to cover it up. I know I don't have to. I used to love the way you had it before. Well, thanks for letting your feelings be known. Come on, you know what I mean. It's just maintenance, that's all. Let's go to sleep, shall we? I'll be in in a mo. Sebas, have you been drawing on the mirrors? What? No, of course not. Be safe! Morning, Miss Williams. Castle Combe School has, yet again, outperformed other private schools across the country. And, for the fifth year in a row, our deputy head and theology course leader, Mrs. Williams, has outdone us all with the most A-stars this senior year. Even if she still hasn't given in her references. Well, I'd accept another medal, but I'm currently out of wall space. Off to class now. No loitering in the corridor. Now! Come on, girls! This isn't a photo shoot. Off to class immediately. Quickly! Sebas. Sebastian! - What? - "What?" - Shouldn't you be in class? - Yeah, I'm on my way. Well, then. Instead of talking to strangers. "Strangers"? Have you got your phone on you? Maybe. Keep it on. In case I need to get hold of you. Thank you. And now into sound. That's it. Very nice. Who gave you that? - Where is he? - Who? "Who?" This is the game you wanna play with me? I bought them. Don't treat me like a fool! I can suspend you, young man. Don't forget, I am your mother and the headmistress. - Deputy. - Inside. Now. We'll finish this later. - Where's your brother? - It's Tuesday. - Yes? - Basketball? Basketball, yes. Of course. Basketball. Mum! Look out! - It's here. - What? - Emily's house. - Oh. - Are you all right? - Yes, yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. - I'll see you later. - Jessie's dropping you back? Yes, Mum. Yes. Love you. Bye. Love you. Bye. Hey! How are you? Hello, my darling. Sorry we're late. No worries. Barry's busy... Place is looking gorgeous. Wow, the spices. Really, so yummy. I don't know how you do it, Neve. Barry's always complaining about my boiled chicken. - Is he? - You have to teach me. You'll have to teach me one of your secret concoctions. - We could make a night of it. - We could. Shall we? He's a freethinker. He's talking about things that the mainstream media are scared to touch. He's hitting a nerve. "White flight." That's how he phrased it on the podcast. - What is it? - Can we talk about something else? It's when white people flee urban areas for the suburbs. - Why are they fleeing? - Because they're uncultured. It has nothing to do with culture. - What's that? At the window. - Love? - At the window! - Can't see anything. Something's coming. Someone's there. Can't you see? - What? - Someone's coming! - Hey. - Hey. Hey! Oh, look at you! I love your hair like that. Oh, it's very... very... Ethnic. - Barry, really? - What? It suits you. Don't you think, Neve? Yes. Yes. Who did your hair like that? - Emily. - Where's your brother? Basketball. I think it's time we made a move. Was lovely. Yes. Wouldn't want to overstay our welcome. Get ready for bed, darling. - Night, sweetheart. - Night. Thanks for coming. What time does basketball finish? He attended basketball. Had a great game, apparently. Uh, the others went for some food after to celebrate the win, but Sebastian didn't attend. And this was? Three hours ago. See? There are people out to hurt us. Out to bring violence against us. Who's out to bring violence against us? What is wrong with you tonight? Really? Now, Neve, calm down. You know how these things are. Young boy's meeting a girl after a good game, on the quiet. Eh, Ian? Doesn't want anyone pulling the rug from under his feet. Yes. Yeah, if you like. Tell you what. I'll head out now and do another round of the town. - I'm sure he'll turn up. - Thanks, Ken. ...so I'm pleased this renovated farmhouse, ten minutes from the village of Santa María de Nieva, is still on the... Now you challenged me... We've come ten minutes up the valley from where we just were, and we've got a detached house. Where the hell have you been?! - Out, man. - Out?! Out? You, you didn't call.

Guys, carry on straight down into the outer grounds, I'm just doing a toilet check. Mary, go. Hello? You tried to get me fired. No. - You want me gone? - Please, it's not what you think. You erased me. Me and Dione. You erased us! We thought you were dead! It's not me! I'm not her! So lovely to see you both. Thank you for coming. Sonia, Jessie! - Oh, thank you. - Thanks so much. - Really appreciate... - So nice. Of course. My pleasure. Hello, darling. - Excuse me. Ready to speak? - Yes, two minutes. You okay, babe? Yeah. Good luck. - Hi, guys. - Hello, Neve! - All looking wonderful! - It's all marvelous. - Thank you. Cakes look delicious. - Thank you. Thanks for coming. Mic check. One-two, one-two. Welcome to our home. A massive thank you to you all for making generous contributions, Today, we dedicate our time to those less fortunate, growing up in barren terrains, where access to the basics becomes a gargantuan struggle. Where simple eye or ear infections can lead to blindness and deafness. When a simple course of antibiotics could afford that child a life of seeing the sunrise and hearing the birds sing... in the morning. As an ode to these unfortunate individuals, our very own choir will perform "The Dream of Gerontius" in sign. The journey of a dead man's soul. Take it away, guys.

Let's get a closer look. Ooh, it looks like candy! - I'm gonna try some. - Me too! - Huh?! - Well, hello, my little darlings. Welcome to my house. So that's them. Uh-huh. That's our family. It's not just giving back. It's bringing it all together, my time here. A graduation of sorts. And a chance to show off the new kitchen? Well, that too, obviously. Let's see. What kind of experience do you have? I haven't been down to London in a while. You found my tribe. Tribe. That's funny. You remind me of her. My wife. Same nose. The school has a great history. It was commissioned by Queen Victoria. Great. I worked a few period buildings abroad. You travel far? I've moved around a lot. Denmark, Brussels. Liverpool. Yeah? Do you follow? Some of my best days were sat in the Kop end, 20,000 strong, sucking the ball into the back of the net. Good man. Hey. The only color that matters. Team colors. Exactly. Uh... Hi? Ian's... daughter, right? Yeah. How do you... I saw your photograph. In the shop. - I'm working there until I get on my feet. - Okay. The glamour of insurance. - My dad certainly thinks so. - I like your hair. - Yeah? - Yeah. I sometimes rock mine like that. Sends the boys... wild. Cool. Uh... I'm still refining it, but yeah. Uh... I like yours too. Coconut oil. We should... hang sometime. - Swap recipes. - Sure. Cool. I'll Facebook you. You got an alias? Um, not quite an alias. Just Mary. Williams. With a hashtag at the end. So, sort of, maybe. Name's Abigail. But you can call me Abi. Say nuttin'. A parking ticket, yes. Exactly. What address is the vehicle registered to? I share the car with my wife, and we recently had a breakup, you see. Thank you. That's the usual address. I'll just tear up the ticket. Great. Got the address. - She hasn't accepted my request. - Just be patient. I can't look at her photos unless she accepts it! We're friends! Don't forget why we came here. You get? - Meanie. - What? Meanie! So, yes, I'd just had tea with Amanda, and I... No phones at the table, Mary. Where's your mum at? Been dreaming about her. Sod off. Ooh! Let me know when you're ready to man up, freak. - Off to class with you. - Fuckin' inbreds. So many haters around, innit? Yeah. Haters. - It's what happens when you're different. - Sebas. Sebastian! It's kinda shit when your mum's the deputy head. - Marvin. - Sebastian. I'll catch you later, Sebas. Yeah, man. Shouldn't let people treat you like that. Here's good. - You got a light? - Uh... I didn't think that... Just kidding. Okay, cool. It's all white label now. No graphics. Like that's gonna stop us. Right? Hell, no. Oh, you... Take that down, man. Yo, like this. Now you. Yeah, there you go. That's that man shit. Who gave you that?! - Where is he? - Who? Who? This is the game you wanna play with me? - I bought them. - Don't treat me like a fool!

So, what brings you to Combe? Thought I'd add some color to the place. Yeah, there ain't no other Blacks around. No. I mean, I guess I'm kinda... - Yeah? - My mum. I never met my parents. What's she like? Who? Your mum? Thinks she's white. Never says anything about her past. - The fuck? - Anything Black, off limits. Shit, man. This weed is strong. Where'd you get it?

Me and Mary, the favorite. You brought her here? What is wrong with you? - That wasn't the plan. - Ah! Nothing! Nothing's wrong with me, okay? I'm done pretending. We should just go.

It's not what you think. Then how is it, Neve? It looks to me like your two Black children just showed... - See? - "See"? "See?" This is somehow on me? You're, you're, you're gonna explain... - Why didn't you tell us? - They grew up with their father. He... He was a bad man. I... I had to escape, so I, I, I, just... Left. You just... left them. Who are you? - I'm, uh... - This is fucked. - This is so, so fucked! - Let her explain. Mum, tell us how... Don't make out you would have been up for raising two Black children who weren't yours, Ian! - You never asked. - Well, neither did you. No. No, that's not fair. I could have. Um... Maybe? Exactly. Exactly, Ian. The two worlds don't mix. And I, I, I... I did what I had to do. What fathers do all the time. What do they want? No, they haven't gone about things conventionally. You never recognized them? It was 16, 17 years ago. Oh, fuck. - Fuck, man! - Stop it. - That's enough. - Please. There is something that I have to do. I will explain everything afterwards. Hey. Can I get you guys anything? - We're waiting on someone. - Sure, sure. Just let me know when your third party arrives. Hi. Hi. So sorry, I'm... Have you ordered anything? Is there anything you want? Take a seat. Thanks. - Thanks for agreeing to meet with me. - Hey, team! Specials are at the bottom. Can I get you anything to drink? Vodka. Vod... Oh. - We don't stock alcohol... - Just... Maybe just some tea. Guys? Tea? Whatever. Great. Bring a pot. Wow. Look at you both. - I hardly recognized you. - What happened to your accent? - Do you hate being Black? - No. That's what bro says. No, no, I'm a proud Black woman. Proud. Look, firstly, please let me apologize. I'm so sorry for my outburst. I... I don't know what came over me. I've been under the most amount of stress, and... You... want to say sorry? Exactly. Exactly, Dione. That's what I'm here to do. It hasn't been a straightforward journey. There have been things that have happened that... that drew my hand... You never reached out. You said you were going to the hairdressers, 18 years ago. - Your father, he was a very dangerous man. - You weren't exactly perfect either. I don't know if you remember what it was like. - On Coldharbour? - Is that a trick question? - No, I... - Why... - Why didn't you take us with you? - I left you with your auntie. She gave us away. She didn't want us. Careful, guys! The tea is super hot. - Don't want anybody to scald themselves. - Would you fuck off! Sure. You're both right. It's unacceptable. I should have written. I should have reached out. There are so many "should'ves." I can't imagine what you must think of me. I'm still struggling to process it myself. Are we... going to move in? To the big house? That's... that's a very important question. And I've been thinking of how I can make things right. And it appears to me that, right now, it's important that you both are able to get back on your feet. I wish I could give more. Maybe I can. Down the line. But here's a check. For £20,000. - A check? - Yes. If you go back to London, it will give you a chance to get back on your feet. Until, uh... Until... we... work it all out? Exactly. Exactly, Dione. Until we can find a way to work it all out. Wow. Look at you both. How you've grown. I've broken it down into two separate checks to avoid arguments. Thank you, Mum. There's no excuse for my behavior. I was... traumatized after the second birth. I never even wanted her. Dione. I was forced. Who knows what would have happened if I'd stayed? If I'd be here now. If you'd be here, even. And so I ran. Escaped. It wasn't planned. I... I saw an opportunity, and I went for it. All this is just restless curiosity. People need to know who they are. Where they're from. Like... on those programs. It doesn't change anything here. They've gone. For now. Back to London. They just went? Mmm. They decided to leave. - Will we ever see them again? - Don't you even want to? All in good time. We need to heal a bit first. Don't we? Before jumping into all that. Now it's important to rebuild our defenses and remember that we love each other. That this is real. That I am real. Your mother's right. We are a family. Whatever happened before doesn't change that. There will be many more conversations to come. Believe you me. But, for now... we have to stay together. Mary. Son? Together, they can better defend their territory. Now this is... Gosh, this is... This ring is astonishing! It is one of the nicest... Oh my gosh, look at this ring! Three quarters of a carat... Hey, Sebas. - Think I might have a bath. - Have you got a clean towel? Couldn't find any. What are you doing, taking a bath at this hour? They're downstairs. Know where the clean towels are kept? I checked the cupboards but couldn't find any clean ones. Right, okay. You never mentioned you were coming round. It's Abigail's birthday. We thought it would be a great idea to bring it in together. Maybe order Chinese. I love Chinese food! Sebas! What you sayin', bro? - Didn't mean to wake you. - Hey, M! Like your PJs. Hi, Ian. Guess what? It's my birthday! - Please, I know how you must be... - Where do you keep clean towels? Is it washday, Mum? Ian, washday? - I know that you're angry... - Sis! Send the menu around. We'll do it like that. On me. It's a celebration. Mum. Mum! I like the hair. You bringing it back to the '90s? Chill. Or see what happens. Chill. Mmm! I'm going Singapore noodle and sweet-and-sour chicken. Peking-style. Mary, go and get the house phone so we can put the order in. You, Abs? Birthday girl. Ribs. Nice. Very nice. - With? - Chow mein. Chicken chow mein. Who's getting this down? - Mary, you getting this? - Wait. I was totally unaware of what happened in the past with Neve... You mean... Cheryl. You didn't know? Oh... It was a terrible mix-up. It's all just been a terrible confusion. I mean, I... We don't condone what she did. We demanded answers too, like the two of you. Now you, Sebas. I seen you on the court. I know you got an appetite. - If we could just talk... - Sebas! What is it, bruv? Uh... Prawn crackers and egg-fried rice. Good. Very good. Gonna be a feast. I like. You lift weights? Ian. I clocked a gym back there. A gym, you know? In the house. We should do a family photograph. After we sorted the order, we can do a family photo. But it's my turn to be in the middle. That's non-negotiable, Mary. Mum, what you going for? - I'll just have a bit of everyone else's. - You sure? I'm buying. Mary. Phone 'em up. Shall I turn the water off? Let it run. Let it run and run. I'm sorry, but we're currently closed. Our opening hours are 12:00 to 11:00, Monday to Sunday. Please call back later. No worries. Don't watch that. Uber Eats. They got Uber Eats in Castle Combe? Ian. - I believe so. - Good. Take my phone, Mary. You find a Chinese. Ian. Now... I know you must be hurting... Sorry. - Would you repeat? - I know you must be in pain... Here you go. Ta. Thanks, Abi. Yep. I found a good one. That's my girl. Aren't you gonna wish me happy birthday? Come on.

Fifteen? Sixteen. Seventeen. Let's play Scrabble! I love Scrabble. You got Scrabble? Ian? Yes, I believe we have Scrabble somewhere. Sebas. You go with Abs and find the board game while we set the table up. Mum? Set the fucking table, will ya? It's okay. Did you write the check or did she? I'm sorry? The 20K she just tried to buy us off with. You tried to pay them off? Mum, how could you? It wasn't intended to... We could have given more. I was just trying to help. Neve, what the hell is wrong with you? Let's round it up. 20K for 20 years. But what could I get for that? It's about a grand for each year, right? You'd need to budget that. Let me see. Shoes on my feet. Getting sectioned. Wetting the bed until just recently. Found it! Let's play! What you buying back with yours, Abs? Please. I told you already. I'm paying off the meanies. And all the things they've done. You do that, sis! You do exactly that! But for now, we're just buying back Cheryl. Isn't that what we agreed? Mum? Teams. Shall we do teams? Oh? This has always been a family favorite. Seems the perfect way to introduce Carl and Dione to the flock. Yes. I see now, this is as it should be, isn't it? With all of us gathered around. Ian? I want a divorce. It's over. Dad, stop it. Can't we try? Teams sounds good! I'll go with Dione. I'll go with Carl. That leaves Mum and Dad. Awesome. Fantastic. Hon? Mum? Dad? What have you got? Okay. Let's see. Let's see, what word do we have here? Ian? - Yeah. - What have we got? "Rhino." - That's funny. - Isn't it just, darling? Me next! Let me know when you want to do that photograph, Dione. Isn't she pretty, Mary? Uh-huh. "Tuna." - Shall we? - Yeah. Okay. Um... So... - What are you doing?! - Bored. I wanna play the game! It's my birthday! I get to choose! - I'm sure we can find another game. - Me and Ian are gonna do a little workout. How about charades or something? Yeah! Charades are sick. Isn't it, Ian? Don't hurt him. Please. Hurt him? Why would I do that? We're family. Right, Ian? - Let's go. - Ian! I'll be all right. I'll talk to him. What kinda KG you pushing these days? A bit. A bit? Must be more than a bit. Let's go. Talk's cheap, right? It's all in the doin'. Right, Mum? Early-morning munchies? Aren't you funny? Yes, something like that. Don't I know you? Um, maybe. Don't know. Not sure I've delivered here before. Nice house. We didn't think we'd find anywhere, what with it being so late. Let me get you a tip for being so accommodating. Everything okay? Wait there. Wait right there. Mmm! Smells yummy, doesn't it? Sebas. Have you seen my purse? I don't know. Upstairs? Yes, that's right. Well done. I can't. I can't. I can't! I can't. Bit of a wuss? You ain't walking away that easy. You made your bed with us. We're the same now. All good. All good. It was in the wardrobe. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry for how this has turned out. I hope one day you can forgive me. Let me tip the man, and then we'll eat and discuss. Mmm. It looks good.
