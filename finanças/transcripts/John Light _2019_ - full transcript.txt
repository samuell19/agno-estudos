- Lester! Move! Lester! - Yo, what's up John? You lost brother? - Where's Lester? He wasn't in Bible Study. - Yeah, about that, Lester ain't going to Bible Study. Seems he had a change of heart. Yeah, decided him and Jesus ain't buddies no more. Nah, nah, nah! Go ahead and let him pass, let him pass. Some people gotta see for themselves. Lester! Lester. You all right buddy? You all right? What they do to you man? You all right? - My brother. Come on buddy. - Yo man, he wanted me to give this back to you. He don't need it no more. Yeah, he told us about how he was being saved and all his sins being washed away by the blood of the lamb. So what we did John, what we did, is simply explained to the man if he continued talking about Jesus around here, the only blood covering him is gonna be his own. - Think you're bad! This makes you bad! This makes you bad! This makes you tough? This, huh! Picking on someone that can't defend themself? - See John, you're not listening brother. You're not listening. You see, I'm in a position of authority around here. I can't let you just walk in and take him. It'll make me look weak. And John, I'm far from being weak. Do you really think this pathetic crackhead is worth dying for? - Nah, I don't. But Jesus does. - Jesus. - They're just people, just like you and me. - Hey, hey, listen up! I need Bibles in one bin, I need everything in your pocket in the other bin! That's keys, that's cellphones, that's wallets! Anything in your pocket, put it in the bin! I need you all to stay together! I need you all to keep in line and as we go through this yard, no eye contact with anyone! Do not speak with anyone! Do y'all understand me? Yes sir. - And one more thing, if anything happens, an incident, anything, do not run. All right, this is a place you don't wanna get lost in. - Is this where they have their church? - Yeah. ♪ With the peace of heaven ♪ ♪ Someone come beside ♪ ♪ Jesus is the Savior ♪ ♪ He's standing in the right light ♪ ♪ We've been waiting here for you ♪ ♪ Since you've ♪ ♪ Come along weary traveler ♪ ♪ Welcome home ♪ Jesus! Jesus! Praise the Lord! - Hey! Hey, break it up! Y'all know the rules! - Guys, don't mess this up. Keep it going, come on. - Sorry about that Officer Mike. There's a lot of joy in this room. - Just get it going. - Holy Spirit got the best of us. Welcome to our church. My name is Eli and I'm about halfway through the 94 years they give me for the many sins I committed outside these walls! Where I thought I was free! Now I'm not complaining. I deserve day, every minute they give me! But I got something in here that I didn't' deserve. And that's the salvation from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! But for the rest of my earthly days, my world's gonna have a fence around it. But it ain't like that for the fellas to my right here! You see, they don't really live here! They're just passing through. Six months or so and they'll all be gone! And they're leaving here ready to fight that spiritual war! They got the word of God to teach 'em the truth! They got support of believers praying them up! And brothers, they got you! So let's meet your new brothers in Christ! We got a list of 'em. Hector Gomez. - Sal Roberton. Come on brother! A lot of people praying for ya. - Mandel Gardner. - Dan Parnell. - Mike Bolden! - Henry Saint-James! - John Light! Matt Garrett. - I bet you thought you were gonna get the scary one, huh? Hey, you know it's all right, you can look at my face. It doesn't bother me. As a matter of fact, I look at it all the time. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to stare. - The tattoos, that's all me, but this right here, let me tell you the story on that. Met this woman down at a dive bar, Apache Junction. She called me dangerous. Ever have a woman call you dangerous? Anyways, three guys walk up behind us, guy in the middle starts calling her all these bad names. Telling her, "Why isn't she home? "Why isn't anybody watching the kids?" - Husband? - Yeah. I didn't know that, she didn't tell me, and trust me, she didn't even act like she was married. - What happened? - Guy on the left, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom! All of a sudden his wife starts screaming crazy. I turn around and look at her like, what's going on? She has a beer bottle in her hand. Boom, cracks me on the head with it. Next thing, I wake up at the hospital looking all around. Doctor's saying, "Why aren't you dead?" So now, they tell me all these wires in my head, they're criss crossed and they're not connected right. I'm not that man anymore man. I've changed. I haven't thrown a punch now in three years. Haven't said a cuss word in four months. - Oh, good for you. I work with truck drivers, I can't say that. - Yeah, being a Christian now for 31 months, and you know what? Don't ever wanna be anything else. - Well, as best as I can, I wanna help you be the man God wants you to be. - That means a lot to me man. Thank you. - All right, let's wrap it up! Let's wrap it up! I need my in-house guys on this side! I need my out-house guys on that side! Let's go! Let's move! - Is there something I could pray for you this week about? - Yes there is. - Either one of you guys wanna steal the ball and go for a lay up? It's cool. It'll get you into double figures. - We don't want your Presbyterian charity. - Are you sure? - Come on now, give us your best shot. - Come on, let me dribble out the clock. - Hey look, you get ready for the good ole testament defense. Hellfire and brimstone! Come on! I don't know about you guys, but anyone who can hit that many three-pointers is not spending much time with the word of God. Know what I'm saying? - Well the good news is we didn't quit. - Who we got next week? - Methodist. No Baptist, and I think they're coming up from Tucson. - Tucson? Why would anybody come from Tucson to play us? - Wouldn't you? - Harold please, will you wake up? It's not one of my sermons! - Did we win? - Anyway, what are you gonna do? - Mike, I thought you were out tonight? Yeah, we're short a guy so I'm filling in. - Well, be safe. God bless. - Hey, you too. You too, thank you. - Oh, hey, hey. What's the current line on that father-daughter dance? - Five to one against you making it. Sorry man. - Oh ye of little faith. - No offense buddy, we love you, but there's just no way. - You don't have a prayer. And I'm a preacher. - All right guys, goodnight. Hey, goodnight. - I wonder how the game went tonight? - Samantha don't ask him. Honey, it's cruel. - Of course not. That would be mean. - Mm-hm. - Hi Pop, you win? Lost a heartbreaker. - Oh. - Hey honey. Hey, you feel warm. You didn't play too hard, did ya? No, no, I'm fine. Take an extra vitamin C with your pills. Just in case. - So are the numbers working out? - For you maybe. The Swerigans can't make it. That's almost 100 extra dollars back in your pocket. - So we are gonna use the extra on flowers. We were a little light. - I was just gonna suggest that. Hi baby. I know, I can't either. Hey Dad. - Yeah. Steve wants to know how the prison thing went the other night. - You know, it wasn't what I thought it would be. It's just way way out of my comfort zone. I don't think I'm going back. - But I thought that was the reason why you wanted to do it? Okay. - And now ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, will you please welcome Sergeant Steve Lyons and his beautiful bride Samantha. - Can I ask you a question? - Of course you can dear. - Do you think I'm dangerous? - Of course I do sweetheart. Now go ask the DJ to play the "Chicken Dance." Will you Mr. Dangerous? Go on. - A friend of the ministry owns a construction company, he brings guys on when he can. You ever work construction? - Yeah, since I was about 14. I mean I'm not a journeyman or anything, but I know my way around tools. - Great, let's give it a shot. - Cool. Hey Matt, tomorrow's my brothers birthday. I mean he passed, but it's still his birthday. - I'm sorry, when did he pass? He was about 16, I was about 12. You know, me and my mom, before I got in here, every year we put flowers on his grave. He had cancer. Fought it like a tiger, but it was all over his body. You know, my brother was older than me, but I was always bigger 'cause he was so sick. Toughest guy I ever knew and he never even had to throw a punch. But now he's in heaven. He was a believer? - Oh yeah. Like he just fell out of the Bible or something. Total opposites man. But he was my best friend. - Any other family? - Just my mom. Me and my dad, we don't get along. - Does your mom ever come to visit? - No. My dad forbids it. You know, Pete used to always stand up for me. He'd be like, "Be easy on Johnny. "The Lord's working on him dad." But when Pete passed, things just got worse. You know, it sounds crazy, but I used to think my dad was God. You know? He'd bring down the thunder, the lightening. I thought God never smiled and he always said no. - When was the last time you talked to him? - It's been about 14 years now. - Maybe he's changed. - Nah. God, he don't change. - Tell you what, why don't I take some flowers over to the cemetery and put 'em on your brothers grave. - You'd do that? I mean, I don't wanna impose. - Not a problem, I'm happy to do it. - That's awesome man, that's awesome. - And if I should see your mom over there, anything you want me to say? - Yeah, as a matter of fact there is. You tell her her boy's almost out of here. He's coming home. Yeah. Oh John, I'm so sorry. Mrs. Light, you don't have to worry about John anymore. In fact, you'd be very proud-- Who are you? - I'm sorry? - I said who are you and why are you standing over my wife's grave? - I'm a friend of your son. I know today was Peter's birthday. - I'm sorry. It's been a long time. So you were a friend of Peter's? - No, I didn't have the opportunity. I'm a friend of John's. - I have no son by that name. - Are you William Light? I am. - Then sir, you do. When will he be released? - No more than two months. - Good. There's ample time to acquire a restraining order should I need one. - Mr. Light, John is-- - Please, don't presume to know more about this man than I. - No, of course not. That was not my intention. - Does he know of his mother's passing? - No. - What does he say about me? - That when he was a little boy he thought that you might be God. - He should be eternally grateful that I'm not. - Mr. Light... - Listen Mr. Garrett, I can see you're a decent man. You feel led to help people and that's commendable. But find someone else. This man will only hurt you. He will only cause you pain. That's all he knows how to do. - Matt, what's wrong? You okay? You okay? Your wife, your kid? - Yes, we're all fine. - What's going on? They don't do this for anybody, you have to have some kind of special pull. - Not me, the ministry. I called Walter, he called the Chaplain who said that this shouldn't wait til next week. And I didn't want to have to tell you on the phone. - It's my mom. It's my mom. She's laying next to Pete isn't she? - She is but her spirit. My friend, her spirit is in heaven with the Lord. She will never shed another tear ever again. She's been gone almost two years. - Two years? Two years? What happened? - I don't know, he didn't tell me. - My dad. My dad was there? - Yeah. - And he couldn't tell his son that his mom was dead for two years? Oh that's right, he's out of sons, huh? You know, my dad had this bad idea when we were about 10. He'd make us learn scripture. And if we didn't learn it by that day, we wouldn't' eat dinner. If we didn't learn it by the morning, we'd go to school hungry. Pete, he'd always be trying to help me. But it was my mom's cooking, that's what helped me. "Hath he said, and shall he not do it? "Hath he not spoken, shall he not make it right?" Meatloaf. "Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden "and I will give you rest." Chicken fried steak. "Judge not lest ye be judged." Pot roast. All these years, when all that happened with a bottle to my head, I thought I had forgotten him, but when I need 'em the most, they're there. She's never go that I was a Christian, that I changed! - She already knows. She's in heaven. She's probably been rejoicing your salvation with Peter for years now! - You see my dad, you tell him his son is praying for him. He can't stop me from doing that. You think that crackhead is worth dying for? - I don't, but Jesus does. - Get down! Down! Get over there! - Jesus! Yes! - John! John! John, what happened? - I'm okay! I'll be out in two months! Don't forget about me! - I won't, I promise! - This prison thing. I know you're not happy about it. How come you never tried to stop me? - Because it would've been wrong and selfish. I could see God working in your heart. You tried to talk yourself out of it but you couldn't' do it because this, this is your calling. - My calling? - Don't laugh, it's true. You've been searching for something you could do to serve for years and nothing ever fit. But this, somehow, it's perfect. And that scary looking fellow, what's his name? - John Light. - John Light is the most blessed of inmates because he has Matthew Garrett standing next to him. And no harm, or evil, or discouragement is gonna threaten him unless it comes through you first. What can I do to get you to understand! - Hey John. Good luck. - Hope I never see you again. - Likewise. What's this? This yours? - Nah, just for today. I figured we've got lots of places to go, we might as well go in style. We gonna ride this? - You coming? - Yeah, heck yeah! Woo! I never wanna see this place again. - Praise the Lord. You're free buddy. - Praise the Lord. Thank you, thank you. You gonna eat those? Fork. When you eat bologna sandwiches for so long... Oh man. You know, my mom, she was from Guatemala. Her and my old man met at a conference. He brought her over, married her in the states. Forbade her to speak her own language. - Why? - 'Cause he thought God heard English. Confused a lot of people because me and my brother didn't learn Spanish. Being as dark as we are, right? But my mom was the best cook. My dad only let her make tacos from her homeland. So we scarfed 'em up and ate 'em like they were candy. As you can see, right? I guess God didn't like spicy food either. - Grace, you look at the menu. - But mom-- - Honey, I'm really hungry. Please, just look at the menu and pick something. Thank you. Excuse me, I'm looking for Herb. - I'm Herb. - Herb, Matt Garrett. Church Prison Ministry. - Oh, hi Matt, how ya doing? Good to see ya. - Great, this is John Light. - Hey. - Hi John, nice to see ya. I got a lot of admiration for that ministry. My nephew got in trouble a few years back and you folks really helped him out. - Yeah, Walter mentioned that. How's he doing? - Don't know for sure. Probably not good, but he's not in jail, he's not on drugs, and my sister can sleep at night, so that's something right there. - Yes it is. - John, you're looking at me kind of funny. You okay? - Actually, that's a smile. - Oh. Well good. John, you'd be the third fella from the ministry I've hired. - What happened to the other two? - Well one stole $11,000 worth of tools of equipment and disappeared and one showed up drunk, real drunk. I had to fire him. He's back inside now. - I can assure you I don't steal and I don't drink anymore sir. You got a drivers license? - Not for another year. How far away he gonna be living? - 8.7 miles. The ministry has a couple of rooms over at the old Midway Motor Lodge. - Midway, I thought that burned? - Half of it did, that's why the rate's so good. - Well you're not gonna make me regret this are you John? - No sir. I'm gonna work hard. I'm gonna work really hard. - All right. Well we're gonna be here for another five weeks. Then we got another project starting up in Scottsdale. So I'm gonna have subs coming and going and I cannot get behind schedule. We'll call this a trial run, we'll see how it goes. - You're not gonna regret it sir. You're not gonna regret it. - Okay. Okay, I got a great worker named Julio drives by the Midway every morning about 5:45. Tell him to pull in the parking lot, look for a big guy grinning like he's on his way to work. You're not out there waiting, no need to ever come back. - I'll be there, I'll be there early sir. - All right. Matt, good seeing you. - Thank you Herb, appreciate it. - Be well. John, thanks a lot. - Nice! - Who was that? Oh, he was with the ministry. - Another one of them prison freaks? My uncle know about this? - No. I was gonna call him right now, unless you wanna do it. If you think them little fingers can take the stress. - You got any family in the area John? - Not anymore. - And you, you're with some sort of ministry? - A volunteer, mentor, and friend. - All right, well, John, what I like about your file is what I don't see. You don't use or sell drugs, you're not affiliated with any gangs. - No. - Although your tattoos might say otherwise. No arrests for burglary or robbery. No sexual assaults, no grand theft auto. You've never taken a swing at a cop. - No, never, sir. - That's a good thing. Let's keep it that way. Matter of fact, some of the people that you haven't put in the hospital seem to think that you were a very nice guy. I've changed. - Excuse me, I need to take this. Yeah, this is Tom. Yeah. Yeah, well. No, no, we have been waiting. A long time. A room without a window is a cell. She needs a window. You have to get her a window. It's good for her spirit. Right, yeah. Okay yeah. I appreciate that. Just do your best. I really appreciate it, but she really needs that. Thank you. Okay, as I see it John, you've got one very dangerous flaw, you patronize bars where guys like yourself go looking for trouble. It says here your MO is that you sit at the bar, you drink a lot of beer and you wait for someone, or a group of someones to challenge you. - In my past I used to like to fight. But I don't that. I'm-- - I used to box okay. But I wasn't putting people in the ER. This is different. What you do is different. It says prior to your incarceration that seven different men needed moderate to serious medical attention after altercations with you. And that's just what's in the file. You and I both know there's more than just that. - That's the old me. That's the old me. - We'll find out. In your last adventure one of your opponents nearly lost an eye, is that correct? - Yes sir. - Well John, you need a new hobby. - I'm Christian. Well that's good, that's great. - Just reading my Bible. - You need a new hobby and I'm gonna help you with that decision. Alcohol seems to be a big part of your problem. - I don't do that no more. Okay. - It's done, it's done. - Great. And you better be done because we're gonna test you. All right, we give our parolees with drug and alcohol issues colors. Yours is blue. Okay. - Yes sir. If you call that number right there on the top every single morning, if you hear some color other than blue, just go on with your day. But if the color is blue, then you've got until five o'clock to get yourself to one of those clinics and give them a urine sample. - Yes sir. - All right, you don't show, you violate, you go back inside. - I promise. You test positive, you violate and you go back inside. Do you understand? - I promise. I don't need a promise, do you understand? - Yes sir. Yes sir. - I understand there's been some kind of a religious conversion? - Yes sir, that's what trying to say, I'm a Christian now-- - All right that's good, that's good. Sometimes that helps. All right, any kind of problems, you call me before they get legal. - Yes sir. - Call and check your color. Keep your urine pristine. Stay sober. - I will. - Don't hit anybody. Stay out of those bars. If you like praying, good, go ahead do it, it can't hurt. And if Jesus is your co-pilot, then you have Him take the wheel because your license is no good. - I understand. - All right. Well I hope you're right. I'll see ya in a month. Come back with happy stories. - Thank you. Yeah. - You want me to take you back to prison? - Nah, nah, this is good. Yeah, this is real good. What's this? - That's mostly baggy pants, t-shirts, and a coat. They're out looking for ya, you're not exactly an average size. - You know what, I'm blessed man. It's better than that orange jumpsuit. - Oh, before I forget, here, this is programmed with the number for the daily, your in-check. If it comes up blue and you're stuck, call me, I'm the second number in the contact list. - It's gonna take me a little time for me to get to use this, but I think I'll be good. - Ministry has the lease on the first 90 days. Hopefully you don't die of malaria while we're waiting to find you a cleaner place. - You know what man, I've got a toilet that I don't have to share with people, refrigerator to keep my food cold, "Jeopardy", "Wheel of Fortune", now a phone. Come on bro, I'm good man. - I'm sorry man. - Thank you though. - Yeah, you take it easy. Yeah man. Couldn't do this without you. Yeah, we'll do it together. - All right. - That's not his car is it? First night out? - How'd you know? - By the way you're looking at me. - Sorry Lord. Hey John? What's up boss? - Hey, you're doing a great job. - Yeah, thank you man. - Listen, we're about 80 % framed here, I got a house in Mesa. I want you and Julio to head over to it, start working on that. When you're done, head up to Scottsdale, Troy's scheduling subs now. I'm gonna be in and out for the next couple of weeks, so do me a favor, if Troy does anything squirrely, don't react, just call me. I'll take of it. - I got it. - All right, keep it up. - Don't worry about it. All right, take it easy! Drive safe! Julio, those breakfast burritos! Bran? That's gross man. It needs to be some kind of sweet. Oh shoot! Man, if I would've forgotten. Red! This sandwich is good man. It's been a while. - Sam? - Hi dad! Dad, what's that? - Oh, that's just an office joke. So what's going on? - Dad, I'm praying. - Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay? - I've been better. - Sam, honey, is it the baby? - No, as far as I know the baby's fine. It's Steve. He just got his orders, he's being deployed again. - Oh no, I thought he was a short-timer? - He was. They extended his enlistment one more tour. Apparently, the Army can't live without him. Trouble is, neither can I. - I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do? - Well, actually there is. Steve doesn't want me living alone in my delicate condition. Can your pregnant daughter move home until he gets back? - Of course you can honey. We'll sit around every night and eat pickles and ice cream together. Did you tell mom? - No, I was hoping maybe you would. I've just been too busy crying and eating and crying. - I will honey. I'll tell her tonight, no problem. - Can you hand me that trash can? - We got an illegal alien and a jail bird. Who's gonna steal from us first? - Would you knock it off? Julio was born in Albuquerque, speaks English just fine when he wants to and John did his time. If I had one more like either one of them, I'd probably think pretty hard about firing you. - What now? I don't think it is. That's what that is, an elevator. It's a square, isn't that a toilet? - Blue, blue! We gotta go, we gotta go! Boss, boss, blue, I gotta go man. - You need a lift? - He can take me, please? - All right go, see you tomorrow. - Hey Light, you worried? - Hey, how's it going? - Passed. - Never doubted it. Wanna go get some dinner? - Thank you Jesus, I need to eat. - All right. - How's your family? - Well my son-in-law just got his orders, he's going back to Afghanistan. It's really a surprise. He was supposed to be getting out. - How long is he going for? - At this point we don't know. Sam's gonna move back in with us for a little while. - What does your wife say? - Well, she doesn't know yet. I have to go home and tell her after this. - You need to go, 'cause I can take a bus, I can walk, anything. - Oh no, no, no. I'm in no hurry. - No matter what though, I'm gonna be praying for you. - Thank you. - That I will do. Thank you. Oh yeah, I forgot to ask, did you find a church yet? - About that. A couple weeks ago I did go to church. A bunch of older people. I sat in the back. A couple old ladies that I sat next to, scooted away as soon as I sat down and grabbed their purses. Went to go during offering time, went to go reach in and give a 20, guy sitting next to me has the offering plate, goes to pass it, takes one look at me, goes the other direction. It is what it is man. Ended up taking off early. Have been catching some preachers though on TV. They're pretty good. - Well that's great, but you need fellowship. We all do. I mean, you can't do this on your own. - I got you. I'm not enough. - You been good though. I did go to church with Julio and his family. A little confused with Spanish, but the songs were great, people were nice. - Well you know, you can come with Julie and me any Sunday, you're always welcome, you know that. - Yeah, about that. I don't know man, I just feel like the prison, that was my true church. We had like a brotherhood, a family, you know? We knew we were the worst of the worst. Convicted sinners, felons, but you know, we knew that God had saved us. Delivered us, given us that second chance. Churches now, out here, they're not the same. I can't go praise the Lord, be all happy knowing I'm not welcomed there. - Well, I know some place you are welcomed. Yeah, where's that? - My house for Thanksgiving dinner. Got a family right there who'd love to meet ya. - Man. I can't impose like that. - What are you talking about? There's no imposition at all, you'd be most welcomed. And they really are dying to meet you. - If I go, if I go, I'm gonna have to bring buns or something. - Sure, that'd be a big help. - I'll do it man. Nice knife skills. Did you learn that from your mother? Yes. Can I see another one? - Looks good. - Ew. - How much time before the call? - One hour and 14 minutes. - Well maybe I should change? - Sweetheart, you changed three times already. You look beautiful. I'm fat. - No, I'm fat, you're pregnant. - What's the difference? - On you it's cute. Okay, there he is. All right, now he took two buses and walked about a mile so I wouldn't have to pick him up. - And he'll be smiling even if he doesn't look like it. - Right! Sometimes it's hard to tell. We know dear, you told us. We got this! - And he has a scar on his forehead and a lot of tattoos. So just look at it and get it over with. A few tattoos, no big deal. I got a couple I never told you about. You do? Matt, you are so gullible. - You ready? John, welcome, come in. - Hello! Welcome! - Happy Thanksgiving. - Happy Thanksgiving! Awe, how nice. - Nice buns! - Samantha! - Oh, the bread. - Excuse my-- - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Oh no, please don't. - Not necessary. - Really, please. - Come on in. - Come in, please come in. - Oh no, no, no! - No. It's fine. - It's okay. - Come on in. - Come in. - Sorry. - Make yourself at home John. Have a seat. Yeah, yeah, thank you. - Would you like some tea John? - Oh yeah, thank you, thank you. - Thank you honey. - Do you have any family in town? - Some don't talk to me, most of them are in heaven now. - Awe, I'm so sorry. Here honey, take your pill. - John here has been working construction for the last several months and is doing very well. - Yeah. - Awe, that's really good. - Yeah I really like it. Thank you. - You like to box John? Samantha, don't start. - Excuse me? - Boxing, in a ring, with the Wii. - We? Who's we? I mean, I wouldn't wanna hurt him. Don't worry about it, you won't. Fight! - Is that all you got big guy? - Yeah, I got more here. - Do you even have it turned on? - Really? I've been in prison but-- What'd you go to prison for, jay-walking? - There ya go! Oh, you see that? You see that? - Oh! - You all right, you all right? - Awe come on! Really? Did you guys see that? I don't wanna play no more. I'm done. Hey, happy Thanksgiving. - Baby!

I can't really tell you where I'm at, but could be much worse. - Good, stay there. - You look skinny. Have you been eating? - Absolutely, everyday. I'm fine, really. How are you feeling? - Much better. Morning sickness is over, it's just getting fat now. - No, not at all. You look beautiful. How's the baby? Is he kicking? - She is, she is. I think we have a soccer star on the way. - Sweetheart. Hey, did you get our package? - Yeah, I did. Thank you so much! It was awesome. I opened it and became everybody's best friend. Popcorn, chocolate, beef jerky, hot tamales. - Hey Steve, I want you to meet my friend, John Light. I told you about him. - Hi John, how's it going? - Hey man! It's good to see you man. - Hey man. - I've heard so many great things about you. - I'm praying for you man. You better come home or I'm gonna go get you! - Thank you sir, I'll do my best. - We'll give you two a few moments alone. Hey, we love you Steve. We'll talk to you again soon, okay? - Thanks mom, love you too. - Goodbye for now pal. Hey John. - Yeah. Hey, I'm praying for you too man. Hang in there. - That means a lot man.

Guests or pregnant, now you sit. The pie is cooling. - I don't know if I can handle pie. That's a lot of food. You can handle pie my friend. - I know I can. Parents, they're really nice. - Yeah they are. Very trusting people. Me? Not so much. - I see that. - I've been hoping and praying for a lot of things John. The baby, Steve, my dad's health, even you're on my list. But I'm telling you, if you are scamming him, or if you hurt him in any way, I'm-- - I would never hurt your dad. I love your dad. Let's put that fork down all right. Oh, well I see someone's ready for pie. - Oh yeah. Country for a thousand. In a 1952 book a craftsman fashions "The Silver" this title drinking vessel to house the holy grail. - Hey Mr. Morgan. - Hey John, how ya doing? - What's going on? - Take it easy. You know a Troy Beasley? - Yeah I know him, I know him. - He says you threatened to kill him. He says you've been coming to work high-- - He's a liar! I don't get high and I don't threaten people! - John, take it easy, I believe you. All right, I already interviewed your boss and your coworker, they say it's not true. - Then why are we here, huh? - He filed a police report. It's my job, okay. We have to come and we have to search your apartment and I need a sample. - Ain't gonna happen. Ain't gonna happen. - John, if you don't let us in, you're gonna go back to jail right now, for nothing. I need you to back down. - Evening John, Mr. Morgan. He's all right. - John, look at me. Okay. I was just in the area and I remembered I had this bag of clothes in my car for you. So I-- - No! - Let's go inside and look 'em over, what do ya say? John. You're gonna have to let us in. You got nothing to hide. They're just here doing their jobs. - "A fool is quick to lose his temper, "but a wise man keeps it." Chicken pot pie. Come in, come in. - 20th century 600. - Who's Hans Greiber? Who's Hans Greiber? Eh? - What, did you go to Harvard and never tell me? - Nah, nah, nah, nah. They show this all the time. They showed that like twice. I see it, makes me look like a genius. - All good? - We're all good. - All right, thanks guys, appreciate it. - Cookie? No. - Cookie. Thank you. - More for me. - John, filing a false police report is a felony, so if you wanna press charges, no problem. - Nah, nah, I'm not even gonna do. You know what, he lost. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna pray for him. In fact, I'm gonna pray for him all night. He can't run from that. - Are you sure you can go to work with him knowing what he just did? - Yeah I'm good, I'm good. - All right. Stay clean, don't punch anybody. - Hey Mr. Morgan! That girl, that woman, the one that you were trying to get the window for. Did she ever get it? - Yeah she did. - Good, I was praying for her. - Thank you. - Have a good night. - You too. - No thanks. He called and said he was coming over, I didn't want you to go through it alone. That was the best excuse I could come up with. - It could've gone really bad Matt. Really really really bad. - Yeah, but it didn't. The old John would've been in cuffs in the back of that police car. But you're not. You're not that guy anymore. Okay John. Hans Greiber? - Hans Greiber. - Inventors for 1000. Alois Senefelder used grease. - Hey. - Hey. - How long have you been here? - Not long. How ya doing babe? - It's been a good day. - Yeah? - Yeah. Wanna sneak out of here and go dancing? - Sure, that's a great idea. I'll just break that window we worked so hard to get and just whisk you out. You okay? Want me to call the nurse? Nurse, can you come back in here please? Nurse! - Babe, please don't babe. They'll just give me something and you'll fade away. - All right, we'll just relax. You okay? - So, how did it go with Mr. Light? Is he back inside? - No, no, he's at this very moment he is sitting on his couch eating Oreo cookies and watching jeopardy. - How wonderful. - It's a good thing. - What? - You remember that raving lunatic that stood over your bed and was screaming at God and the doctors about how life was so unfair? - I do. But we know he didn't mean it. - Well tonight, tonight we were like really close to things going bad. I mean one word and in my head, I was praying for John Light not to ruin his life. And then his friend, mentor guy shows up and talks to him for a second and then like a little miracle, John, he just backed away and he let us inside and he said one little Bible verse. But at the end instead of saying amen, you know what he said? Chicken pot pie. - What? Why did he say that? - I have no idea, no idea at all. But then afterward I was leaving and he said, well he asked me if that woman ever got her window. - Did you tell him about me? - No. I never tell them anything personal. I think he overheard me on the phone once. But ever since then, he said that he's been praying for you. Yeah, what is that about? - I don't know. I don't need to know. It just goes to prove God hasn't forgot about us. Not for a second. Not ever. - You better have this house cleaned up before I get home! - Troy Beasley? - Yeah, what can I do for you? - How ya doing? I'm Tom Morgan, I'm John Light's parole officer. You filed a report with my office the other day. - Yeah, I remember. You guys finally lock that freak up where he belongs? - No, no, we didn't, we didn't. Because he didn't do anything wrong. Now you realize it's a felony to file a false police report, right? That means I can lock you up where you belong! - Look, I think there's a mistake here. - No, there's no mistake here. You tried to put an innocent man back in prison. - But that wasn't my fault-- - All right, shut your mouth and listen to me! For some reason John is not gonna press charges. Okay that makes you a very lucky man. But if I ever hear your name again about anything, I'll throw you in jail so fast it'll make your head spin. Are we clear? - Yeah. - Good, get out of here before I change my mind. You okay ma'am? Caliche. Oh! I gotta take this, here. - He's sick. - Go. I gotta go to school and take him-- - Go, go. Do what you gotta do bro. All right, I got this. - How are you gonna get home? Happy boy's not gonna take you. - City bus bro, don't worry about it. Go. Hope everything's okay! Shoot, shoot. Shoot! Julio! Julio! Julio! - What's the problem big guy? - Come on bro, not today man. Can you give me a ride? - Drug screen? You forgot to call again didn't you? Yeah. - Man, what a predicament. I think you're screwed buddy. You don't have a license and I can't leave the site unsupervised. Man, life could be just so unfair huh? - That delivery don't come for four hours bro. We can make it over there and back and still have plenty of time. - No. No. I think you're screwed buddy. Sorry man. Well. Oh, you know. I could give you these. But then I'd have to call the cops and say you stole the truck. - Why do you have to be like this bro, come on. We could be good man, we could be friends bro. Come on. - Yeah, not a... You know, life's just unfair man. Good luck to ya. - This is Matt. Matt. - Hey man. - Hey bro, I forgot again man. I didn't call in and it's blue. - Whoa, slow down. - I'm panicking man, I'm panicking. - What about Julio? - He left early, his kid's sick. - I'm all the way across town about to go into a meeting. I would never make it in time. - An hour and a half man. I don't know what's gonna happen bro. - Can you call a cab? - I only have six bucks on me. Tomorrow's payday. Dude, I don't wanna go back in man. I don't wanna go back in. - Give me 10 minutes, I'll call you right back. - Okay, I'll be waiting right here. Thank you. - Hey Light! You got about 47 minutes! You don't wanna be late! - Get in! Sam! Thank you. - You know what I was doing 20 minutes ago? I was getting a sonogram. - I'm so sorry. - I was looking at this Little girl inside of me. It was wonderful. And then do you know what happened? - What? - The nurse came in and told me that I had an emergency phone call. And that was it John! Steering wheel, Sam. Sam, the steering wheel. - But it wasn't that, thank God. It was my father telling me that you had an emergency. Gotta get to the clinic in less than an hour or you go back to jail. - Sam, Sam, the turn off, the turn off Sam! - I dare you to tell me about my driving John. I dare you. - No, no. - How could that of possibly taken so long? - They said I was nervous. Maybe possibly to some driving. What'd you say? - Nothing. Perfect driver, I just wanna go home. - I always knew I'd like you John. - Yeah. I wonder if you didn't like me. - All right. John, did you pass? - What? - Your pee test, did you pass? - Oh yeah, yeah, of course. Come on. - Good. Come on Sam. - My father will be very happy. - Tell him I miss him and I think about him. - All right. - All right. And don't forget pal, you're gonna be paying for this baby for the next 20 years of your life! - Sam! - You're a jerk! Really Sam? Really? So easy John. Too easy. - I'm gonna tell your Dad! And so that's what this program is really all about, changing lives. Oh, I see our speaker has just arrived. So let's go ahead and take a five minute break and we'll be back. - How ya doing? - Hey! Thanks for coming. - Oh, my pleasure. Good to see ya. - So hey, how are things going? - Oh, everything's great. Wife is great, Sam's home for a bit, John turns out to be the big brother she never had. She picked him up this morning for donuts. - Well that's a great answer, that's a great answer, but tell me, how are things really going? - Hm? - Look, when I first started this ministry, I had big plans and a great vision for a ministry that would change peoples lives. Like you and the men are doing here, you're changing lives, and when you do that, the devil shows up. - Oh. - And he shows up big time, and when that happens, it can get dangerous. So tell me, how's it going? - Did you just call me dangerous? You should tell my wife that. - Ah, maybe I will. - Look Sam, whatever I did, I'm sorry. - After I was horrible to you the other day, I went home. I was too wound up so I just went to bed. Do you know what happened? - What? I had a dream. The most amazing dream I've ever had. - That's nice, right? - John, it was more than nice. I'm sitting with a group of people, side by side, and on my right is this woman I've never met. She has red hair, and she's sparkly, and by the way that we're talking, we're gonna be friends. - Was she holding beer bottles? - What? John, no. Do you wanna hear this? Yes. - Okay. I'm pretty certain that you're friends with her too. Maybe like a girlfriend, okay. So she's on my right, and on my left is Steve. Home from the way, no wounds, smiling from ear to ear. Do you know why? - Why? - Because he's holding our little girl. Our beautiful baby Emily. And next to him is my mom, proud grandma. And next to her is my dad. And then there's a final man who also can't stop smiling. - Okay, where was I? - See, that's the thing John, you were and you weren't. Somehow I know that you were the reason that we were there. - Is that bad? - I don't think so John, I really don't. It couldn't have been bad. We were all so happy. But John, it was more than a dream. It was a vision. It was the future. Somehow I know that. God gave me a glimpse of the future and I know it sounds crazy, and I didn't ask for it, but, now I can eat, I can sleep, I'm not afraid and I'm not breathing into paper bags. My point is, what I came to tell you is I've been hoping and praying for peace. And God used you to bring it to me. And I want to thank you for that. You were part of my miracle. - I've been called a lot of things, but not a miracle. Hey, is this yours? - Yeah. It's you? - Do you know me? - Yeah. - I saw, yeah the taco shop huh? - Yeah. - Hey, I remember you. What's that? You restore my soul. Jesus right? - Yeah. - You like Jesus or you love Jesus? - I love Jesus. - I love Jesus too. Oh my goodness. Gracie! Gracie! You know her? Nothing happened. You put your hands on her. - Dude, I didn't do nothing! - Settle down! - I didn't do nothing! I don't want no trouble! - Then back up, turn around, put your hands. - I was just here. Turn around, put your hands behind your back. - I ain't gonna do that. - Turn around and put your hands behind your back. I didn't do nothing! - Get down, get down! - Yeah it's Beasley. B-E-A-S-L-E-Y. Yeah, dudes a bad guy. You know, he just got out of prison, I think he's on drugs. You know, he threatened me the other day actually. I told you guys but you didn't do anything about it. Anyway, he's been out here looking at these kids for a while. - Come on man, I'd never hurt kids! Shut up back here. - Creeps me out, you know, 'cause I'm a parent myself. - All right, well if there's anything else you can think of, just give us a call back, all right? - Sure thing officer, just let me know where I can help. - You bet. Okay. Is that 2B? Yeah. - 2B. Or not to be. John, everything that happened this afternoon was just one big mistake. - You know what, this morning I was someones miracle! And today, today what? This! - Listen, go in there and get some sleep, I'll come back tomorrow. And if you have any crazy thoughts or anything, you call me any time. This is all gonna be okay. - It's not gonna be okay! - I promise you that! It's not! Why did you make me feel like I belonged! I'm an animal! I belong in a cage! I belong in a cage! - John-- Oh Lord. It's my mom. She's laying next to Pete isn't she? She is, but her spirit, my friend, her spirit is in heaven with the Lord. She will never shed another tear ever again. She's been gone almost two years. Two years? And he couldn't tell his son that his mom was dead! - No charcoal! How long have you known we were gonna have that barbecue tonight? Can't you do anything right? Are you incompetent? What is your problem! Do I have to do everything myself! "Hath he said, and shall he not do? "Hath he spoken, shall he not make it right? "Come to me all who are weary "and heavy laden and I will give ye rest." She's never gonna know that I was a Christian, that I changed! She already knows. She's in heaven. She's probably been rejoicing in your salvation with Peter fro years now. If you see my dad, tell him his son is praying for him. Still got those beers? - Heck yeah. Come on in. ♪ Take this fainted heart ♪ ♪ Take these tainted hands ♪ - Honey, what happened? ♪ Wash me in Your love ♪ - I could make you feel better. ♪ Come like grace again ♪ ♪ Even when my strength is lost ♪ ♪ I praise you ♪ - What? ♪ Even when I have no song ♪ ♪ I'll praise you ♪ ♪ Even when it's hard ♪ ♪ To find the words ♪ ♪ Louder then I'll sing Your praise ♪ - Matt!

My fathers heart was like this long before you met him. - It's all my fault. Today was just-- - Crazy, I know. He told me. - Everyone I love. It's 'cause of me he's there. - He was there John. In my dream he was there. He's gonna be okay. - I can't just sit here. Does everyone I love have to die! I'm gonna pray for Pete more Lord, I knew it would help. And my mom, I didn't even know she was sick. And Matt, I don't want him to die Lord. I need him. I need him Lord! You take anyone, you take me. You take me. I deserve this, not him. I'm the bad one, not him Lord, not him. He has his family. He has a wife, he has Sam's baby. I deserve to die, not him. I have nobody, you take me. - Just take her in. - Yes, yes, yes. - That's so great. What's going on? - Oh, he's out of surgery! Is he okay? - They put in two stents, the doctors think it went well. Praise God! - Jesus. Thank you Jesus. - I know, thank you. Oh, I was so worried. - It's gonna be okay. - He's gonna be okay brother. He's gonna be okay. Thank you man. - Yeah. - Oh John, this is Rick. Him and Matt work together. Car guy. - Yes. - That's me. Give me a hug man. - I know, I know, I'm so relieved. Stay safe. I love you too.

What are we gonna do with you dude? - Hey. - Hey, how are you doing? - Forget about me, how are you doing man? - I'm great now. Sam told me your news. I'm very proud of you John. - Yeah. Doing good? - It's gonna be great. You'll see. Proud. And I love you brother. - Love you too man. Love you too. Is he all right? Is he all right? - Yes, yes, we had to sedate him. Medicine makes him sleepy, he's just sleepy. He's doing so much better than he was yesterday. But he's gonna be fine. It's just the medication. Okay? - All right. So what's this news that involves me? Your dad mentioned it. - Oh. I told him that you decided to go to our church in the morning. - Why Sam? - I don't know. I just wanted to say something that would make him smile and that was the first thing that came to mind. Maybe I just lied to my father, in the hospital. Maybe I didn't. Look, I gotta get mom home. Rick said he'll give you a ride. - All right. - I'll be at your house at 8:30 in the morning. - All right. You're the best! You're the best! - Mm-hm. Tell me about my son. - The curb Sam! Sam, the curb! - I'll be back for you in an hour. - What do you mean you'll be back? You're not coming? - Can't pal, gotta take mom to the hospital. She's a little too shook up to drive herself. - I can't believe you're doing this to me Sam. What if I can't do this? - You know what, Steve is with his buddies on the other side of the world and they're praying that you can. Now get out of my car. - I can't believe you're doing this. - You got this. You can do this champ, eye of the tiger! - You at least gonna be here when I get out? - Yeah. Maybe. You got this! - Hey, good morning. Welcome! - How ya doing? - Good. First time here? - Yeah. - Hey, I got a seat out here that I'd love to take you to. - It looks like it's packed. I'll probably do this next week, not today. - Nah, today's a great day. Come on, let me seat ya. - All right. - It's easy. Come on brother. Come on. - I can sit like right here, somewhere in the back. - Yeah, that's a good seat but I got something better. Jimmy, meet John. Hey brother,. - Yeah. So glad you're here. Good morning, and welcome to First Christian Church. We're delighted you're here this morning. Good morning! - This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it. Won't you please stand and greet your neighbor and tell him how happy you are that they're here, that you get to spend the day with them. - It's you! - Hey. It's okay, it's okay. We're her parents, we're the Millers, and we're really sorry about what happened at the park the other day. - Look, I was just talking to her. I didn't do nothing. - I know, the teacher completely overreacted. - We've been praying for you every day since your picture was in the newsletter. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you. Hey man, we're so glad you're here. - Yeah. Can we talk after service? Please. - All right, thank you. - Come on everybody, you're stalling now. Let's go ahead and have a seat. Sooner or later you have to sit here and listen to me preach. So might as well be now. Okay, turn your Bibles to... - We friends? - More than that, come over for dinner. - Bye guys, I gotta go okay? I'll see you in church. - Have a great day! - What's wrong? Your dad okay? - Not my dad. Your dad. "When you pass through the waters, "I will be with you. "And through the river, "they shall not overwhelm you. "When you walk through fire, "you shall not be burned. "And that flame, "it will not consume you." Pancakes.
