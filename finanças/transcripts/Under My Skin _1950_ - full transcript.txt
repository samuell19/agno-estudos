[ Bell Tolling In Distance ] [ Tolling Continues ] Ain't I sweatin' enough? Nope. Hey! -Joe! - What? You ain't run half enough. I've run a hundred percent of what I'm going to. But you gotta weigh in at the track at 61 kilos. It gets tougher every day to keep it down. Then you gotta stay on your feet and fight it. You stay on your feet and fight it. I'll fight it from right here on my tail. Come on. Sit down and enjoy the sights. Look at that church over there. - Pretty as a postcard, huh? - Uh-huh. Where can you see anything like that? - Maybe in America. - Huh? What does it look like? Well, like it looks like here in Merano, Italy. I guess with the horse track down there and the mountains... I guess it does look a little like Santa Anita in California. I've seen it in books. They got everything in the States. - Dry up,Joe. - It said-- - Dry up. - Why is it that whenever I try to talk to you-- Come on. Dry up. Dry up. [ Laughs ] We'll cool off walking back to the funicular, huh? - You better run. - Tight as a drum. - Oh, yeah? - You got your doubts? - With everything? - Everything. - [ Groans ] - Maybe we run? Hey, okay, lead off. - [ Speaking Italian ] - Grazie. [ Dog Barking ] [ Man Speaking Italian ] You know, kid... if you're getting tired of chasing around, we could settle here. - If we could go back to the-- - We could settle here, for instance... and get us a house and hire a woman to do the cooking. - How about it? - Anything you say, Pop. 'Course, we'd have to get us a nest egg first. Which ain't easy. Well, you never can tell. We may be able to get off the merry-go-round before you know it. - Good idea, huh? - Yeah, Pop. Gee, don't the track look pretty from here? [ Crowd Cheering ] [ Both Speaking Italian ] [Joe ] How you doin', Pop? Go get 'em.! Go get 'em.! Come on, Pop! Where are you, Pop? [ Speaking Italian ] It sure looks like it. You want him to look like he's trying to lose? Everybody's not as stupid as you. I bought him to lose. He'll manage to lose. [ Crowd Gasps ] He don't act so bought right now. - He'll lose. - Now he'd have to fall off the horse. You got it, Pop! You got it! You got it! You got it! You got it! That's my old man. [ Speaking Italian ] - [ Speaking Italian ] - Shut up. Hey, Pop, what a finish! - Never throw away good tickets. - These? These. They'll be good. [ Italian ] - What's the matter? This cookie bump you? - Skip it. [ People Cheering In Italian ] Say, Pop, do you know what it was like when you was coming off the stretch? - Like what, kid? - Like pulling the cork out of a bottle of Chianti. - [ Makes Popping Sound ] - Pianola, kid. This course rides itself. Double-crosser. - What did he mean by that? - Hot air, kid, hot air. [ Speaking Italian ] Skip out and get us a cab. I'll be dressed in five minutes. Okay. [ Man Speaking Italian ] With the French visas. The visas! [ Speaking Italian ] Of all the luck. Three more days and Americans won't need visas. We got three days, ain't we? What's the hurry? I'm sick of it here, kid. - But just this morning you were talking about settling down. - Well, that was this morning. Now I got a hankering to see Paris again and ride some real horses. Is that where we're going this time, to Paris? They've got the best tracks in the world up there. Any objections? - No, Pop, only-- - [ Knocking ] [ Both Speaking Italian ] Only what? Come on, spit it out. Only-- Only back home in America, I hear they have swell tracks too. That again,Joe? I'm surprised at you, falling for that stuff. America? Flat tracks. Dirt tracks. And the life there? It's on the fritz, believe me. - Here, we go where we please and see the sights. - [ Tires Skid ] Call the porter, quick. Tell him to bring the bags back. - What's the matter, Pop? - Oh, never mind. Now look,Joe, now we're gonna have some fun. I want you to slip over the roofs and down. - The way you do when you're playing with the kids? - Yeah. Run for the station and grab the tickets for Paris. Can you handle that? - You're pulling my leg. - Am I? Now look. You see Bork down there? - Yeah. - Well, uh, he's coming up. He's been pestering me about going into business with him, and in a weak moment I said yes. - Now I don't like the smell of it. - I see. He knows I won a big bet on myself, and he wants a piece, which he's not gonna get, see. So I'll stick around here and kid him along, wait for the visas... then, uh, I'll meet you at the station, right? - Right. - Okay. - But, Pop, you don't think-- - Have I ever lied to you, kid? - Of course not. - Now stop your yakking and get going. I was only yakking 'cause I'll miss the fun with Bork. Yak, yak, yak all night and you'll miss the train. Go on. The police. [ Continues In Italian ] - Dan Butler. - [ Speaking Italian ] S?, s?, l'Americano. [ Yelling In Italian ] [ Footsteps Approaching ] - Who is it? - [ Speaking Italian ] - So who were you expecting? - Well, it's about time you got here. Where's the rest of my money? You know we made a deal, didn't we? 1 0,000 lira before the race, 1 0 after. Where's the other 1 0? - [ Italian ] - No, no. Just how much did you bet on yourself today, smart boy? [ Chuckles ] I don't bet 'em, Bork. I ride 'em. - Tell that to the steward. - Exactly. In the stretch, they had me covered like a blanket with their glasses. I tried to give the race away all the way. Was it my fault your boy wouldn't take it? - I did my job. - You could have fall off. Are you telling me how to ride? I'm not risking my neck or my license for a measly 20 grand in liras. Now, Louis, let's have the rest of the dough. Come on. I lost three million lira. Much more with the books. Well, there are a hundred different ways a deal can go sour. You can get your money back. That wasn't the last horse race in the world. You set something up and, uh, make sure it don't go wrong. I'm not going anywhere. - No? - No. Where would I be going without the kid? I'd hate to think I've been double-crossed, especially by a tinhorn crook. That would hurt my pride. All right, if you feel that way about it, tomorrow when the bank opens... I'll pay off what I can, and the rest I'll make up to you. First you were demanding the rest of your dough. Now you're in a hurry to pay me back? Search him. [ Phone Ringing ] Hello? Well, Mr. Butler's tied up right now. Yeah, I'll take a message. The desk clerk downstairs. Good. He says your bill is ready. I'm , uh, changing hotels-- bedbugs. Fine. - Good. - [ Hangs Up Phone ] And he said your visas have come. Get him! [ Lock Clicks ] [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] [ Speaking Italian ] [ Train Whistle Blows ] [ Blows Whistle ] [ Train Whistle Blows ] Grazie. Hey, Pop, hurry up. Boy, made it. - What happened? - You sure missed some fun. There she is, kid-- Paris, the sweetheart of the world. Well, here we are, kid. I had my stable trunk shipped here. I got a pal that-- Hey! What's the matter, Pop? It don't look the same. It's the right corner though. - It's gotta be. - I thought we were going to the horses. I had my stuff shipped to my best pal, Claude. He runs the place. I figured he'd do okay, but I never expected a deal like this. [ Chuckles ] I think we sent our tack to the right spot all right. - Hey, gar?on. - Monsieur? - Where's the boss? - Pardon? [ Speaking French ] [ Speaking French ] He's got a nightclub too. Sit down. - Where you going, Pop? - Cool your brain with a lemonade. I'll be right back. [ Woman Speaking French ] - [ Orchestra ] - [ Woman Singing In French ] Hey. [ French ] - Shh. - [ French ] - Monsieur Claude? - Oui. [ Humming ] [ Speaking French ] - Claude isn't here. - No? Well, I'm an old pal of his. -Just blew into town. - I know who you are. - I know all about you. - Yeah? - Yes. Now get out. - What? I've been waiting a long time to say that. You've been waiting-- Listen, I just came to-- Your trunks came this morning. I sent them back. You sent all my stuff back? Your baggage is no more welcome than you are. Listen, lady, I don't know who you are and I don't care. I don't like strangers shipping my trunks around. I got my tack in them. - How do you expect me to get work? - That's your worry. Maybe the express company still has them. If not, follow them back to Italy. Listen, nobody's throwing me out of anywhere. Who are you anyway? - Where's Claude? - Get out! - [ Speaking French ] - Hey! I never saw that dame before. Who is she? Where's Claude? - [ Speaking French ] - [ Speaking French ] Ah, forget it. - [ Continues ] - If anything happens to my stuff... there'll be French chicken feathers scattered all over this joint. [ Both Speaking French ] - Henri. - Oui? - [ Speaking French ] - Bien, madame. Gee, ma'am, I thought you was Pop when you shook me. - Dan Butler's your father? - Yes, ma'am. - You've been here all afternoon? - I don't mind, ma'am. Lots of times Pop gets tied up in important business. I guess you'd like me to pay up and move along... only Pop's got the bankroll and he's -- - I know. - Sure is a long jiffy. - I suppose you're hungry. - Not very, ma'am. - Tell the truth. - Yes, ma'am. There's a cure for that. Come upstairs. I'd better sit here like he said. He won't mind. Are you a friend of Pop's ? Yes, we're great friends. - Come along. [ Speaking French ] - Huh? - [ Horn Honks ] - Yes, ma'am. Someday you won't object so much when a lady will ask you to her apartment. - [ Speaking French ] - Oui, madame. [ Speaking French ] I only hope Pop hasn't gone and got himself lost. Believe me when I tell you, your father knows his way around. Well, that's the way it goes, ma'am. A merry-go-round, Pop calls it. Why did he get out of Italy so fast? He just got the itch again. But why did he come back here? You sure are full of questions, ma'am. I'm his friend. It's nice to know what your friends have been doing. He said his friend was some guy named--named Claude. Oh. And besides, you Americans are very strange. A big country of your own, but always going round and round. Do you know anything about America, ma'am? Me? A lot. The G.I.Joes--They were around for quite a while. Would you tell me what you know, ma'am? I only have a one-sided view of America. I doubt if you'd be interested. Fair is fair, ma'am. I let you pump me. Well, the way I got it... America's a great big country which is entirely populated by men who are misunderstood. - No, not entirely. - Huh? There are also the women who misunderstand them. If it isn't the wife, it is a girl who is out sitting under the apple tree. What apple tree? The good old apple tree. A lot of things must grow on trees-- cigarettes and chocolate bars... nylon stockings-- anything. - I don't get you, ma'am. - What? Getting taken in like that. You oughta be ashamed. You sure got took in. - Oh, I did, did I? - You sure did, swallowing that. Why, America's wonderful. Anybody knows that. Apple trees. Why you're as bad as Pop. I keep trying to tell my Pop... that anything you want's right there. - They have the " swellest" racetracks too. - Then why did you ask me? Nothin' You know so much, just like your father. Always looking for a chance to put out your chest and make a speech. - Nothin', ma'am. - Then why? Why did you ask me? Because I ain't never seen it, ma'am. Never? Not to remember. I just ask guys about it, read some and-- Sit down, kid, and finish your dinner. - I'm full. -Just hungry for America. Well, don't you like being a Frenchman, ma'am? Yes. Sit down, kid. - It's a very good mille feuilles. - The cake? You sure got funny names for things here. Anything's funny until-- until you understand it. - Your mother's American? - Sure, until she died. But I got some relatives. Would you like to see their pictures? - I wouldn't mind. - I don't know what she died of. Pop only says she got sick of chasing after the horses. Here. That's my Aunt Esther and my Cousins Herb and Bill. Uncle Ned's taking the picture. Don't pay attention of what I said about America. It's a fine place for a boy. Okay. They live on a farm in Michigan. That's where Pop met Mom when he was down on his luck and riding on a hick track. - They keep inviting us. - Then why don't you go? Pop? Don't ever ask him. And don't tell him how I shot off about it. Don't get me wrong, he's a great guy... but-- but he's kinda funny about this. You won't , will you, ma'am? It's a promise. And stop calling me " ma'am." I've got a name. My name is Paule. Now you are kidding me. Paul's a guy's name. You have Paula or Polly. Can't we have Paule? Polly. That makes sense. My name's Joe. Not G.I.Joe,just plain Joe. I've got to go down to work, but make my place your own. I guess you're a pretty good boy. I wish you luck, Plain Joe. [ Door Closes ] [ Woman Speaking French ] - [ Speaking French ] - Oui, monsieur. - Merci. - [ Speaking French ] - [ Orchestra ] - [ Paule Singing In French ] [ Singing In French ] [ Singing In English ] [ Continues ] [ Ends ] [ Orchestra Ends, Resumes Jazzier ] Your kid's in my apartment. He was hungry. I fed him. Oh? Well, thanks. That was nice of you. It's a shame he hasn't a father to take care of him. Oh,Joe's doing okay. He's smart as a whip. I got some good news for you. My trunks have to be sent back here whether you like it or not. Listen, do me a favor, will you? Sit down and tell me what you've got against me. - It could take all night. - Good. Take all night. [ Cash Register Bell Dings ] Now I've got news for you. Once I admired you. - Call it hero worship. - No kidding? I love the horses and the excitement... and you were, as Joe said, a great jockey. Oh,Joe is prejudiced. One day at the track... you fell at the water jump right in front of the stands. Then you got up again and tried to win. People yelled and screamed, and I yelled. I think I even cried. I know I went around outside the jockeys' room to get a look at you. I bet I didn't tell you to get out. You didn't even see me. You passed me on to Claude. Oh, well, that was very nice of me. Wasn't it? I was a kid. Many thanks. Well, maybe now that I'm back, Claude will return the favor. He's quite a guy. Always asking me for tips. Cigarette? No. Which you sold him, good or bad? And he sold back to some sucker for a rosy profit. I did him plenty of favors. You certainly did. Everything he had was yours. Everything you told him, he'd do. That was you and Claude when I started going around with him. You put him in the right crowd and sold him the right tip. And then you pulled out at the right moment. Back to America, wasn't it? Where you met that girl at that hick track. But Claude had no place to run. - Claude is dead. - Claude... dead? When? What difference does it make? They killed him for what you got him into. - [ Applause ] - [ Cash Register Bell Dings ] [ Orchestra Resumes ] [ Speaking French ] Look, you talk to me like that, listen to my answer. - Why? - Where do you get this I killed Claude stuff? If a guy plays for big dough, there's big risks. It's the breaks, the odds, the chances he takes. You too. You were so in love with this guy, you gotta blame someone? Go get your boy and get out. You're a pretty cold dame. - You bet I am. - I enjoy cold dames. - [ Both Speaking French ] - Who's the monkey in the cage? The monkey in the cage is Henriette, my sister. [ Speaking French ] - [ Speaking French ] - That was a little too rapid for me. - What'd she say? - She's reminding me about myself. That all my life I had to do with stinkers. I don't know why, but if there is a real no-good heel around... I sooner or later end up with him. So get your kid and get out. Or you'll end up with me? - There he is. - Miss Polly, I went to sleep on your couch. We go, kid. We're being given the rush. Not him. Kids are all right until they grow up into men. I'll be back if only for my trunks. When it comes to women or horses,Joe... you stick with the horses. Good-bye, sweetness. Let's see. We're over here. We'll hop out to the horses. It's Maison Lafitte. Just right outside of Paris. Three times across the river and step on it. - Okay, kid? - Okay. Horses,Joe? I'll show you a place that's got more horses than a dog's got fleas. You see, that's how they start off the babies. [Joe Laughing ] Look at 'em. - Will they learn to like it? - Oh, sure. It's in the blood. And what's in the blood don't ever come out. Hey, George! Danny. Danny Butler. Well. English jock, George Gardner. Pretty good. - Well, are you back for good? - When have I been anyplace for good? - My kid,Joe. - All grown up and out of his three-cornered pants, eh? What are the chances of rustling up some mounts? You know, I could use the money. Why not? By now they must have forgotten all about-- Well, uh, as long as they haven't forgotten how I can ride. Well, I'll be seeing you. - At the caf?? - Sure, every day. - Still the same old place. - Right. Be seeing you. [ Swing ] - [ Speaking French ] - [ Speaking French ] Say, there's just the guy I'm looking for. [ Both Speaking French ] - Oh, Drake, I got my license. Came this morning. - They sent it up from Italy? Without a word. Why wouldn't they? How about giving me some mounts? - I used to do all right for you. - We'll see, Danny. - Say, Pop, when are they gonna get us some horses? - The breaks will come. - We going to the races? - Don't we every day? You know,Joe, you gotta have more than horses on the brain. You gotta branch out. How's your French coming? Great, I guess. Polly's a good teacher. Say, uh, maybe we oughta go over there this afternoon for another lesson. Swell. You don't think you're overdoing it, do you, Pop? No. You need the education. It's good for you. There's the bus. Come on. [ Laughing ] - Hello,Joe. - Hello, ma'am. The first few times you said it was your trunks. - Well, you got them. - Well, now it's the kid. Every day, " When are we gonna see Polly? When are we gonna see Polly?" - Drives me nuts. - [ Mouthing Words ] I hope it doesn't make you mad, Miss Polly, ma'am. - You can get used to anything. - I, uh-- I wish you'd tell me how you do it, kid. I can't get to the starting post. Tell you how I do what? Well, I don't do anything. I-- Hey, what do you got a hold of,Joe? Don't let him tease you. She's very beautiful indeed. Go over and show me how it's done. You mean, really go over and speak to her? - Sure. - Well, what would I say? First time I ever heard you run out of words. [ Paule ] A gentleman would begin, "Pardon me, mademoiselle. " And then he would wait to see ifhis intentions were welcome to the lady. - Wouldn't a gentleman? - Hmm? Oh, yeah. [Joe ] If I was to give her a hot tip tomorrow... maybe her mother would let me take her out to the track. That's great. Go try it,Joe. - You really think I oughta do it? - Why sure. Oh, well, she probably doesn't play the horses anyway. Keep looking for her,Joe. She'll come back. You just keep looking for your girl. You'll find her. Don't worry,Joe. You two want me to be alone? Excuse me. Is he a friend of your father? - No.Just a guy he knew in Italy. - Oh. - I'd better go and see Dad. - No. Let's talk some French, hmm? - Um, that is--[ Speaking French ] - Huh? - [ Continues In French ] - What took you so long? What did it all come to, all this stuff of going to Nice... and the tickets you bought to South America and later sold? What did it get you, huh? A month of life. Yes, that's something. And paying me back in francs instead of lira. You came all the way up here just to tell me that? No, Danny boy. I'm here on business. Of course, with pleasure as a sideline. Taking care of you will be my pleasure. I always take care of sidelines. I can't forget you, Danny. Every time I look in the mirror... I think of you and how much you owe me. It didn't hurt your looks. I hear you got ruled off down there. I read where they asked you to move along. You cost me almost everything I had. You left me holding the sack with the police. You put me on the run, and I don't like being on the run. You shouldn't try to buy an honest jock, Louis. Oh, beautiful. A wise boy like you should know that I'm not kidding... when I tell you I think I'm going to kill you, Danny. Just as sure as you're sitting there, pretending you're not scared. I'd do it now, like that, without a thought, except I want my money first. I'm funny that way. - Why, hello, Mr. Bork. - Hello, boy. - Ain't you a long ways from home? - Go away,Joe. - Why? Ifhe's still at you about that business deal-- - Go pester Polly. Okay. A business deal? Is that what you told the kid? In a way you're right. Everything has its price. A double-cross has its price. I'll pay you back. I said I would. Only now you've gotta give me a chance. I ain't even been riding. Riding horses isn't going to get you that kind of money. I'll give you a chance. I'll give you a week. - That's next Monday. - What do you mean a week? Plenty of time for a smart guy like you to cook up something. Pay up and then we'll see what more there is to it. I might even let you live a while. I don't know. It depends on how you behave and what kind of mood I am in. Gar?on. La chaise. - La chaise. - La chaise. - La table. - La table. - [ Knocking ] - La porte. La p-- I'll never learn it, Polly. - Polly. I'm beginning to like that Polly. - So am I. - Come in, won't you? - Thanks. [ Speaking French ] - Um, la fen?tre. - La fen?tre. - La femme. - La femme. - L 'homme. - Pop? - Mais oui, l'homme. - No kidding? Pop, l'homme. Hop in a cab, kid, and head for home. You're man enough to do it alone. I have some things I wanna talk over with Polly. I got some things too. She's giving me a lesson. Let's stay together, huh? Like fly on flypaper. Now get going. LittleJoe, do what Papa says. Now look, kid, don't be sore with me, huh? Okay. Some things you think I ain't big enough to get in on. Ow! How did he know to look for me here? Right here. - Then he is what you ran away from. - What do you mean ran? Don't you think I know? I'm worried aboutJoe. - I'm sick inside with worry. - I can imagine. Well, I'm not interested, not in him any more than you. I won't be. I had enough troubles. I'm not going to get myself mixed up again. - If you think you like your kid-- - I'm crazy about my kid. Then do something about it. That farm, in America someplace. Fresh air and milk and not stables and hotels. - He told you? - Sure he told me. Do you think it was fun? It was like-- Once, the day Paris was liberated, I saw a man. I stumbled on the body, ripped open with everything showing. That was just a man. What do you think it's like to see a kid with his heart showing? - I know. I know. - You don't know anything. - Why don't you take him home? - Because I can't . Are you even running out of places to live? Yes. [ Speaking French ] Sure. It's easy to say what I ought to do. But he won't go without me. A pup you can't shake loose from. What's a guy gonna do when he's broken every rule in the books... and his kid still thinks he's the 1 3th apostle? You find the answer. I'm always covering for him-- The guys with the dirty postcards he doesn't know are dirty postcards. The girls he thinks are being polite. [ Chuckles ] The whole show. It can't last. Nothing lasts. I'm running out of lies. Help me till I can spring him loose from me. Tell me-- How does a man get to be... a 1 00% heel? It's easy. [ Laughing, Chattering ] [Joe ] Gee, Pop. There's a horse like even I never saw before. - Who is he? What's his name? - Which one, kid? How can you ask me which one? That one, Pop. He sure looks full of run. Huh. Oh, well, he's the favorite. His name is-- His name is King. I'll be right back. Have you got something in this race, Danny? No. Give me time. I gave you time. From now until tomorrow... is time. I'll, uh-- I'll go into the jocks' room and see what's cooking. I guess you'll want to stay with Polly, naturally. Sure I want to stay with Polly... - but I wanna see what's cookin' too. - [ Chuckles ] You'd better go,Joe, and see what's cooking. - Okay, kid, come on. - Dan? You go ahead. I'll meet you there. How bad is it? You had better tell me. Louis? My friend Bork? Well, he says I owe him a lot of money-- Quite a fistful. He'll get it or he won't . - And then? - What else could happen? - I can handle Louis. - Are you sure? Well, maybe. Maybe. [ Chattering ] - George. - Hi, Danny. Hello,Joe. - What's the dope? - I'm riding King. King? You're sure lucky, George. I never saw such a horse. [ Chuckles ] Kid, here's 200 francs. - Bet it on King to place, for you and Polly. - To place? Sure. George is a good jock. He'll be up there. Go on. I'll meet you out front. - Okay. - [ Bell Clangs ] [ Man Shouting In French ] I, uh-- I wouldn't ask you this, George, but I need a winner, bad. That important, eh? Is buying a slice of life important? - King won't win. - Who will? Breeze, and if he does... - save me a couple of tickets. - Right. - [ Man Speaking French ] - [ Laughs ] Never bet on anything I tell you, Danny. Here, kid, climb up on this. - Here, take my glasses. - No, you keep them. Look at number eight,Joe. - Who? - Number eight-- Breeze. Aw, he ain't in it with King. Good-looking horse. Nice quarters. But he ain't a champ. King's a champ. [ Crowd Roaring ] [ Bell Clanging ] - What's going on, Pop? - Oh, nothing much. - They're all bunched up. - Who's in the lead? [ Dan ] Doesn't matter who's in the lead on the back stretch. - [Joe ] Where's King? - Please,Joe. No thanks, Polly. What's going on, Pop? - Breeze is making his move. - Who? - Breeze, a good horse. - Please,Joe. No, thanks. - Where's King now? - He's still back there, loafing along. - Now's no time for him to be doing that. - Here, LittleJoe. You're dying. George is waiting a long time. - Ain't he waiting a long time? - He's a good jock. He's waiting too long. He's choking him to death. He's waiting too long. Turn him loose, George. - Turn him loose. Turn him loose. - He must have heard you. [ Crowd Roaring ] - Look at him come. King, King, King. - Come on, King. [ Dan,Joe ] King, King, King.! Allez, King.! Come on, King! Come on! [Joe ] King, King, King.! Who got it? Don't say it wasn't King. I, uh-- I think he ran out of track, kid. - I think it's Breeze. - He really couldn't . He'd have had it in another stride... but I think he ran out of track. They're gonna post the numbers. - [ Crowd Groans ] - It's Breeze. - It's a crime. - I thought you said George Gardner was a good jock. He is, kid. He's a great jock. It took a great jock to keep that King horse from winning. You mean it was a boat race? The stewards will throw the book at George. You can go and collect your bet. Good thing I told you to play it place. Tell you what I'll do, kid. Just to please you I'll go back and bawl George out... and then I'll meet you at the car. Didn't you bet? No. Well,Joe, this betting on the racehorses doesn't make sense. We spend 200 francs. We almost die of worry. We do more work, really, than the horse does. And what do we receive? A profit of 40 francs. - It's better than a kick in the pants. - What? What does it mean, "kick in the pants" ? You can't take it with you, Polly. [ Laughs ] Well, you can try. I'm going to speak to your father... before you die as poor as a rat in a church. Gee. I would have thought Pop would bet a million. - Say, Polly-- - [ Dan ] An even hundred for 1 0, right? [ Speaking French ] [ French ] Uh, we were told to go to the car. [ French ] Oh, oui. The luckiest bet I ever made in my life. Breeze came through. Good horse. - You lied to me. - Come on. Let's go. - You said you didn't bet. You lied to me. - Let's go. You knew it was a crooked race because George told you. You lied and bet on it. That makes you no better than a crook. - Don't be a snot. And stay out of my business. - You're a crook, a crook. Joe. - You beast. - You stay out too. I am out. Polly.! Polly.! I hate you. I'll run away. Polly! You won't run away. You'll do what I tell you. Now come on. Dad, I've said I'm sorry a hundred times. Sorry? What's sorry? The boat's sailed, and yours is going to. Now come on. Let's get going. But you said it's on the fritz over there. Now it's on the fritz here. I remember when you bought me those shirts-- Down in Rome, after you copped a big one. You got 'em big 'cause you said I was growing like a stink weed. Don't you even want to remember the good things? I'm sick and tired of having you in my hair. Now get going. Come on. [ Train Whistle Blows ] But-- But what if Aunt Esther don't want me? - She doesn't even know me. - She'll want you, all right. All women like kids, and all kids belong with women. Haven't I done everything I could? I got you your tickets. I gave you a letter to show you every step of the way. I got guys to help you all along. I gave you most of my money... and if that runs out, I'll get you more. - You won't be a burden on anyone. - [ Whistle Blows ] Now stop your bellyaching and get on the train. It's gonna start to move. Come on. All right,Joe. - So long, kid. - [ Whistle Blows ] Don't send me away, Dad. Don't make me go. Please, Pop. Please don't make me go. Joe,Joe-- It's for the best. [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Whistle Blows ] [Jazz ] [ Singing In French ] [ Continues ] Hi, sweetness. [ French ] [ French ] [ Song Ends ] [Jazz ] - Dan! - Huh? Dan, what's the matter? Are you sick? You got hurt? No. [ Chuckles ] No, I'm in great shape. I just came around to look the dump over. I got my fill, and now I'm going. Hey, you know, that was a pretty good number you did. You really know how to sell it. [ Sings In French ] You're not sick, you're drunk. You're filthy drink, and I came running after you. I figured you would. You're right. I'm sick. I've been to the doctor. He told me I've got everything. - I got T.B. and cancer and I've got you. - You're crazy. No, no. No. I haven't got you. Let me look at what I haven't got. I'm sorry, Dan-- If I hurt you this afternoon I'm sorry... but you hit a kid who has done nothing but tell you the truth. - LittleJoe-- - Keep his name out of it, understand? He's none of your business. He's none of anybody's business. You're really sick, Dan. Come upstairs. I'll take care of you. - I'll do anything if you need me. - Might lower your standards. You've been used to dealing with pretty high-class heels all your life. You told me so. - Please, Dan, come on. - Everything's got a price. Double-cross, a slice of life, a toothbrush, a dame. You pay for what you get. [ Chuckles ] Here. Here. Here. I haven't got much left. I spent the rest on a spree. Pay, pay, pay, pay. Why did you do that? [ Car Starts ] [ Horse Whinnies ] - Morning, Dan. Who you riding? - Gilford. - [ Laughs ] Good luck. - Yeah. I'll need it. - Sick this morning, Dan? - No, I'm okay. - Where's your boy? - Today he's okay too. [ Horse Whinnies, Snorts ] [ Men Laughing ] That's the meanest horse ever born. [ Whinnying ] - Why-- How would you like to get rid of him? - Why, what do you mean? If I can't get any mounts, I'll buy one. How much? Well, if you're not joking, you can have him for his feed bill-- And I'll throw in the saddle. You've made yourself a sale, my friend. Now I'll show you how to handle that animal. [ Horse Whinnying ] [ Whinnying Intensifies ] What are you doing out here? I figured it out, Pop. You didn't know it was a boat race. I was all wrong. You just didn't like the odds on King... and you picked the long shot, Breeze. And you're a gambler, Pop-- a great gambler-- and you just fell into a potful ofluck. - Here. It's all yours. It ain't mine. - But how did you-- He got off the train, Dan. He came back. Alley cat a guy can't get rid of. For years I've been drumming up enough courage to send you back home, where you belong. Now you come floating back, like you're running the show. I ought to break your neck. Come here. Come here! - [ Laughs ] - Gee, Pop. I was scared you'd be sore, but you ain't sore, huh? Hey, Polly, he ain't mad. [Joe Laughing ] I like to run with you, Pop. Just like old times. Sweatin' plenty, Pop? Hey, kid. I got a surprise for you. I'm pooped. What you are-- You're soft, like jelly. What are we training for? We got a horse we can't get out of the stall with a derrick. I got a notion about Gilford, Dad. What ain't you got? You're full of notions as a bargain basement. We're owners. Just one week, and we'll get our owners' papers. 'Course, we ain't got our colors yet. - You got a notion about that? - Red, white and blue. What? Red, white and blue-- French colors, Pop. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Sure. What's your notion about the horse? The way I figure it, it's not just his muscles that need training. It's his character that needs working on. [ Laughs ] Like me, huh? No, Pop. Don't get me wrong. Well, go on about the horse. Something you showed me once-- The babies in the ring. Maybe he hasn't been happy since he was a young one. Maybe that's what's wrong with him. Maybe he wants to jump. Maybe he's a jumper. Say. [ Chuckles ] [ Dan ] Up, boy.! Come on.! You know, a trainer once told me if you got a mean or a nervous horse... put him in the jumping ring, and nine times out of 1 0-- Like that. Up, boy.! Higher, boy.! [ Band Plays Fanfare ] [ Speaking French ] [ Waltz Time ] [ Singing In French ] [ Continues ] [ Continues ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Continues ] [ Crowd Singing Along ] [ Song Ends ] [ French ] I know you. You're Danny's friend. My boy-- He has good taste. - Uh, he isn't here tonight. - No. I'm not expecting him. No, I don't imagine he's much of a night bird now... but still, he could be celebrating, couldn't he? You saw this, I suppose. [ Louis Reading Out Loud ] Yes, it looks as if our Danny is in-- I am in. We all are in. Just what do you mean, "We all are in" ? Of course, you know, Danny and I-- We have had our little differences. Small matter of money. He's been paying me, now and then. Little installments. But now, with this, it looks as if he may end his troubles. The horse will do it. To the horse. To Gilford. To Dan. I think it's about time he got a break. He told me he was indebted to you. He told me several times, and he was worried about it. So was I. Ah, but that's all past. Behind us. With a horse like Gilford, a man can get along. And he should. I've waited. As a matter of fact, I've been extremely patient. To Danny. Everybody's favorite. Well, my dear, if you will excuse me... I must go take care of my sideline for tonight. I always take care of sidelines. Ask Danny. Mademoiselle. [ Indistinct Conversations ] Seventy-five kilos. Hey, Polly, where's Pop? I don't know, darling. I just got in from Paris. - I suppose he's still at the stables. - We've gotta find him. - Do you know what they expect Gilford to carry? - No. - Seventy-five kilos. We've gotta tell him. - Come on. [ Whinnies ] - [ Door Closes ] - Hey. - Hello, Danny. - Louis. - How's the horse? - [ Chuckles ] You want a tip? Ask the guy on the street. Everybody knows how's the horse. - You think he'll win? - Oh, I know he'll win. Good. Now I've got a surprise for you. He's going to lose. What's the angle? Don't tell me you think you can put the fix on up here in France? Oh, no, no. The fix isn't on the race, Danny. It's on you. You see, I'm booking every bet I can against you. - It's a fortune. - I could pay up even with the purse. I'm not interested in just even. "Set something up, " you told me in Italy... "and it won't go wrong. " I'm setting it up. Nothing doing. Nothing doing. Nothing doing in general, and... nothing doing in particular. Italian gloves. Oh, good leather. Handy. I told you, Danny, that when the cash account was square... [ Groans ] I'd let you know what more there would be to it... - depending on my mood. - [ Groans ] I'm in a good mood, Danny. You're in luck. Throw it. [ Sharp Groan ] I said throw it, Danny. Throw this for me tomorrow, and you're a free man-- clear of me. For old times' sake. [ Groans ] What's just one more boat race? How can I-- How can I believe you? Who cares? But you can believe this-- If you don't lose, you'll never live... to crawl into your bed tomorrow night. Hey, Pop! The kid. - [ Whinnies ] - Hi, Gilford. Let me loose. - All right. - [ Groans ] You fooled that kid for years. You can do it for one more day. Or do you want me to have a talk with him? - Lookin' for me? - Dad, they put 7 5 kilos on her. Hello, boy. Good luck tomorrow. - The horse looks great. - What were you saying? - Oh, nothing. - What's on your mind? Gilford's gotta carry 7 5 kilos. He can win with 1 00. Now go fix his blanket. [ Gilford Whinnies ] - Are you going to-- - Am I going to what? - It would killJoe. - Stop telling me how to live. Will ya? [ Gilford Whinnies ] [ Accordion ] - [ Exhales ] - More coffee? Huh? No, thanks. I'll, uh-- I'll go for a walk, I guess. - Alone? - Why not? Dan--What do they want you to do? - Throw the race? - What do you think? Are you going to? Don't worry. I'll win by a mile, if I can. - And what will Bork do? - He'll kill me, if he can catch me. - But, Danny, you're crazy. - Yeah? - It's just this one race he wants? - That's what he says. Then lose it. Pay him back. Get rid of them, once and for all. That's funny coming from you... after that crack you made this afternoon in the stables. - " It would killJoe." - But it's just one more race. Just one more-- One more and one more, and that's the way it goes. When I was 1 5 I threw my first one. I've thrown hundreds since. Now look at me--The places I run away from. The places I can't show my face. A guy winds up playing tag with himself. - He's gotta stop sometime. - But only after this one. But this one isn't mine. It belongs toJoe. It belongs to the kid. He made it. It's his horse. Nobody else in the world could have thought... of making that horse into a jumper butJoe. The least I owe him is a-- Is an honest ride. But, Dan-- You can't this time. I beg you. You can't take the chance. Look, honey, I-- A guy winds up with whatever he's got, and no more. I'm not talking about money. Any bird with a million dollars can be a millionaire. But now me-- [ Chuckles ] I'm one of the poorest guys on Earth, but-- I got something. I-- I got the love for my kid. The rest I spent on the way, but I still got that. Yes, Dan. And I love you too. Funny kind of setup we walked into-- Me going for you. You going for the kid. Kid going for me. I love you with everything. Yeah? [ Chuckles ] I'm a fine guy to love. You're running true to form. Do you still want to take that walk? Why not? Alone? No. Don't worry, honey. We'll find a place. There just has to be another place. Oh, Dan. [ Chattering ] Four and a quarter miles. - And twice over the river jump. - That's far enough. - Sleep last night? - Oh, like a top. You? I didn't . Look, Dan. You won't win. Bork'll have somebody in there just to put you down. - How do you know? - He offered me the job. How could you resist? George, I, uh-- I want you to collect the purse money for me. - Here's a letter to the stewards. - Bork will kill you. Maybe. With the purse money and all I win on myself... I want you to help Polly get my kid back to the States. Maybe she'll go along. I hope so. Dan, my horse won't win... but he's got a good turn of speed up front... so I'll ride alongside of you as long as I can... and see what I can do to help. Thanks.Just long enough for me to spot Bork's monkey. That's it. [ George ] I'd give a lot to know who Louis's boy is. Say, you wouldn't cross me and try to win, would you? [ Chuckles ] I might. [ Bell Clangs ] Hey, Pop! I never saw Gilford look so good. He just looks great. Come on. [ Chattering ] [ Man Speaking French ] - [ Crowd Roaring ] - [ Bell Clanging ] What a spot, Pop! Hold it! He'll make it,Joe. I know he will. Sure he will, Polly. - [ Crowd Chattering ] - [ Man On P.A., Indistinct ] Yeah, there he comes. When is that-- Dan! [ French ] He should have stayed down. Anybody can see he's trying to win. Maurice ought to kill him. If he don't , I will. You're on your own. It's George, Polly-- George Gardner. Too much to ask of him to make up that much ground. It's a cinch now, eh, boss? - Why doesn't he quit? - Quit? The old man quit? Give it to him, Pop! Turn him loose. Give him everything. [ Whip Slapping ] [ Whip Slapping ] [ Crowd Murmurs ] [ Chattering ] Where the devil is Maurice? Where's my boy? - Come on, Pop. You can do it. - No, Dan, don't do it. [ Crowd Roaring ] - Come on, Pop! Come on! - Don't ! - Come on! - No, Dan, don't do it. Come on, Pop! He won. He won. He won. He won. [ Crowd Murmuring ] Pop! Pop! - [ French ] - Let me at him. He's my pop. [ All Talking ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Speaking French ] Come,Joe. Pop, y-you feel okay? I-- - I guess we made it, huh? - We sure did, Pop. Well... that's all that counts. Just another race. Why did you do it, Dan? Well, this one, I-- I had to win. Maybe-- Maybe now we'll go home together, huh? Yes, Dan. I promise. Pop.! Maybe he's fooling. [ Sobbing ] [ Both Weeping ] We better go,Joe. Joe, your dad rode the greatest race I ever saw. He died winning it honest. That can't ever take that away from him. - He was a great jockey. - Will-- - Will they put his name on the Roll of Honor? - They can't keep it off. He was a greatjockey-- And a great guy. Sure. He was my old man.
