[music playing] Thank you. JOEL FISCHER (VOICEOVER): Joel Fischer, Joel Fischer, Joel Fischer. Henry Norman? Let me tell you, I was just about to hand it back and say, hey, man, right box, wrong name. And then I felt it. One of those lovely little plastic rectangles that spells out instant credit. And it seems old big ugly, the giant computer that keeps trying to stick numbers on people, finally blew one. And I must say, it couldn't have happened to a nicer group, even though it was a mistake. Henry Norman. Hen-- you make a weird R. Norman. I get to be Mrs-- Mrs. Henry Norman. And a second Mrs. Henry Norman. Henry's a bigamist. And just in case someone says there's no such man, here he is, personally pasted together out of computer sheets. There we go. Yay! Terrific! Bravo, Joel. I think this calls for a celebration. A little toast. Go ahead. Uh, to the first 21st-century man. To a new spring coat. To the computer who giveth all. May he never taketh away. Um, to Henry Norman. Yeah! JOEL FISCHER: Yeah! Hear, hear! [music playing] Avery! Avery. Come on, man. At least listen, will you? I mean, look at it this way. Haven't you ever wanted to step on a computer, too? You take a little shot at the whole number system? Look around you. We're not students here. We're-- we're numbers, computers, man. That's where it is. They pick your courses, grade your papers, and turn out your lights at night. And they even turn on the sprinklers. I'm sorry, Jerry. I told you before. Hey, come on. I'm asking you for you help. I mean, what do you want me to say? Look, it's not just me. There are three others in trouble. All right. What happened? Well, the bank is about to bust poor old Henry Norman. It's gonna take a genius to bail him out. And you're it, pal Come on Hi, am I late? No, they should be here any second, I hope. I got him! Maestro comes. Welcome to the cabal, Ave. Your friend and giant brain's been giving us a hard time. You know Joel, prodigy. This here is Lisa, light linguisitics. Hello. Hi. And this is Karen McMillan. Hi. Hi. She knows absolutely nothing about computers, so don't be too pleased to meet her, all right? I'm trying to get close to her myself. Anybody down there? Nope. Well, should we get started? I understand you're into something like advanced computer cybernetics and theory or something like that. Yeah, something like. The incredible Henry Norman card, from whence all credit springs. They way I figure it-- The way we figure it, there is a Norman Henry living in town. We looked him up. The giant brain apparently reversed the name and address and sent it to Joel's post office box. An obvious computer good, right? Meant for a rich townie, and it comes to an underaged, impoverished member of a despised minority-- a student. So we started using it. I mean, what else are we gonna do? -It's illegal. -It's not illegal. It's credit. It's very American to have credit, Avery. In fact, it's, uh, more American to use it. It's not illegal, honest. We opened this account, and we all kick in when we get money from home. The bills do get paid. I don't know. Don't you see, Avery? Nobody will give students credit because they don't own anything. The problem is the computer has caught its mistake. The bank sent us-- I mean Henry Norman-- this credit questionnaire, lousy with suspicion. Hey, Jerry, I don't get it. Exactly how's he gonna make the bank believe there is a Henry Norman when there's no such person. Don't ask me, babe. I am just a poor, dumb med student. I only practice on that thing now and then. He makes it sane. Come on. Way I figure it, Ave, we ought to be able to satisfy the bank through our computer here, seeing as how it's the biggest one in the area. A lot of companies like Seacoast National should have their computers tied in by phone line. That's right. It's called timesharing. Then all their files and records are in this memory bank here, right? That's exactly right. Oh, wow. Do you mean you can create an entire Henry Norman in here? It's theoretically possible. We don't need a complete Henry Norman, though. I mean let me have that paper, Joel. All we need to do is lay a little background on him. This is the profile we want. Here, Joel. He's 35. An engineering degree from here, then a master's from MIT. Employed at Dynatech, 28 thou a year. I'd say that's a pretty solid citizen. I think big ugly's gonna love him. This could take quite a bit of time. You see, each company has its own codes. So it may take dozens of code combinations to get the computer to give me the bank records. Well, yeah, but you can do it, baby. Come on. Sit down. Joel, lock that door, will you? What does that mean? I'm just identifying myself to the computer. It's called logging in. Hey, how'd he get you to do this? Threaten to shoot your grandmother or something? Come on, let him do his thing, will you? [music playing] I got it! That's it. That's good. Way to go! OK, I took the original mistake and the computer correction and wiped them out of the memory banks. So your Henry Norman is laid in just like you wanted him. Look at that, man. It's even thanking us for the account You might as well take the programs. Then you won't need me. Do you know what we've done, gang? We've defied all the laws of nature. That's what we've done. We've created a living, breathing, spending man out of sheets of paper and little plastic cards. Everybody over to the Wagon Wheel. We are going to celebrate. It's all on Henry Norman. Here, Joel, you hang onto these. Give me that. You'll be staying sober. Why always me? You know why. Uh, the prodigy here, he can't drink, you know. He's a hypogly-- --cemiac. Hypoglycemiac. That's low blood sugar. Well, you'd think a promising young doctor would know how to say that, right? Come on. Thanks, Ave. Come on. The party's for you, too. No, I shouldn't. I've got some work to do. You look guilty. Do you feel bad about playing games with the almighty brain? I don't know. Maybe I should. Oh, come on. [music playing] As graduate medical students, you all might as well get to know Proto-- prototype patient model two, an advance, we think, on the original at Caltech. He's not a bad sort, doesn't complain about the bill, and I think he'll give you all the symptoms you'll need to look for. Jerry? Movement, pulse, respiration, even down to skin tone. And if he's not treated right, he's even programmed to die for you. [music playing] Knight to king bishop six. [music playing] Queen to king bishop three, and score another one for big ugly, the giant brain. Checkmate. Oh, no. I'll be darned. I'm finished. Well, you lasted longer than last time. I've got it programmed to see three moves ahead now. If I can get it up to four, you'll have to take up bridge. What have you got programmed for spring vacation? You going home? No, I never go home unless I have to. Well, then, you're gonna have free access to the machine. Yeah, I know. That's why we're all staying. 'Cause we love our computer. Linguistics, sentence 13. Run, John. See John run. [music playing] Very good. Oh, hi, Flint. Would you like to check this program for me when you get a chance? Oh, yeah. What's the matter? Can't get it to talk? Oh, I'm getting it. It knows its vowels. And now I'm teaching it to recognize fricatives. Hmm. But you know once it can talk, I'll bet it has nothing to say. Either that or it'll talk your head off. Yeah. Run, John. See John run [music playing] Uh, Lisa, I got a friend here wants to meet you. What? Say hi. Oh! Get out of here, you nut. Come on, Proto. We're gonna go over and see Joel Wake up, Joel We got trouble. Oh, no. Not again. What's wrong with him this time? He's got kidney failure, or so it was diagnosed by three of my classmates. I guess so. He's not even breathing. Well, he's not plugged in, you dummy. Oh. The truth is, he's got a short somewhere down here around his naval. Doc Benjamin says, get that bright kid Joel to run it down or I'm gonna have to send it back to Caltech. And I said, not a chance, that Joel is into probabilities and game theories these days. Good. 'Cause actually, he makes me a little sick. I said not a chance unless it's for me. Oh, I got to remind you again, right, that I fought for you in Vietnam? Here, sit down there. It's the duty of overbright pathetics you-- All right, all right, all right, all right. I'll tie him into the computer. Then I don't know why I got to worry about kidneys. Allergies, that's where the bread is. No night calls, nobody dying on you Just line 'em up, zap, zap, zap, six bucks a head, thank you very much, ma'am. You are strange. Hey, uh, Proto's beginning to look like Avery. Uh, can I talk to you a minute, Avery? Oh, sure. You know I've been playing chess a lot with Joel. And he, um-- well, to put it mildly, he's a high verbal. He talks too much. He's been telling me about this fictitious guy that you created with a computer. Fictitious guy? Joel showed me the program sheets. Oh. Do you think it's a good idea? I mean, for you? Well, I just thought it was sort of a prank, you know? I know. But I just don't want to see anybody get into trouble. AVERY JENSEN: Wasn't my idea. Well, they couldn't do it without you. You're the only student who's capable out of all. I get the feeling I'm being discussed. Not exactly, unless you've become to identify very strongly with Henry Norman. Why'd you tell him? He didn't tell me. Look, Fletch, butt out, will you? You're an employee here. Just keep the machines running. Don't try and ruin our lives, all right? I'm sorry you feel that way. Well, we need counseling, we'll go to the counseling center. OK. You're right. It's none of my business. See you later, Avery Paternalistic creep. We'll be lucky if he doesn't fink on us. I'll tell you, Jerry, I don't care if he does. You got no business talking to him like that. Just count me out. I don't want anything more to do with it. [music playing] Practically treating us like criminals. Hi. Hi. Hi. Who is? What happened? Our Henry has, uh, received another letter from our friends at the bank. And they would like to know in no uncertain terms why Dynatech has no record whatsoever of his employment. -Oh, boy -Yeah. Yeah. We'd better close up the account quick. To close up an account, one must pay up an account. And we are behind almost 100 bucks before these new bills came in. There's my new spring coat. 50 bucks. Joel, why do you keep it so hot in here? It's the temperature of the brain. I think better. Here's one pair of shoes, low heel, blue and white. Mine. We're up the creek. There's at least $100 here, and probably more we haven't even-- Wait a minute, now. Don't panic. I mean, we knew this was bound to happen sooner or later. They run checks on charge accounts periodically, right? Dynatech is a timeshare on our computer. What we need is a complete Henry Norman. Get him on the Dynatech payroll, then get him a social security card, a complete employment record. I mean, everything a real person would have. He'll be more complete than I am. But how can we? Avery's the only one who knows how, and he doesn't want any more to do with it. JERRY: Well, there's one way. What? One person. Who? I couldn't do that to Avery Why not? Hey, what's this? A gun! [music playing] Who bought a gun already? Well, somebody bought it. Kay's Hardware. [music playing] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We have-- we all have duplicate cards now. Why couldn't Avery have one? Avery? Avery. JOEL FISCHER: Hold on. Maybe it was Henry Norman The real Henry Norman is alive and well and living in the heart of the computer. Cut it out, Joel It's creepy. Whoever's playing jokes, I don't like it. Will the real Henry Norman please stand up? [music playing] [knocking] Hi. Hey, hi. Your landlord told me just to come on back Can I come in, Avery? Oh, sure. Sure. Sorry. Uh, I didn't realize that you were here to see me. Well, there's not much of anything else to see but you. Oh, here. Let me help you. Um, I have some beer. Would you like a beer? Yeah. Thanks. Here. You know, this is probably the only place in the whole school I wanted to drink it out of a can in order to keep from getting a disease off the glass. That was a compliment, Avery. I think. Oh, thank you. Hey, where'd you learn to make such neat hospital corners? In the Army, Avery? No, I wasn't in the Army. Uh, how's Jerry? Why? I hope you don't think that I'm Jerry's property or anything like that. As a matter of fact, Jerry sent me here to con you into doing something you don't want to do. Boy, you're kind of direct. Well, six years of psych, I guess I'm entitled. So you're in psychiatry? Please, psychology. I have my master's. I work at the outpatient clinic. That's why I'm interested in you, Avery. I'm curious what it means when you have the neatest, most spartan room in the history of US education. Well, what does it mean when you keep using my name? You must have called me Avery three or four times. Well, that means I'm trying to make contact. You are kind of a remote guy, Ave. Avery. Hey, what's this? Hmm? Looks kind of complicated. Oh, no, it's not. This is simple binary. Binary? Yeah, binary system. Look, this is 13, the number 13. It's base two. Usually you count in units of one, 10, 100. You count int blocks of two-- two, four, eight, and so on. And one is a yes, count it. Zero is no, don't count it. That's the way computers talk to each other. I don't think I understand. I don't think I ever could. Um, what's Jerry want? Oh, you can guess. It's, uh, Henry Norman again. Listen, I didn't want to come here, but the others sort of-- anything I say is gonna sound like a con Look, you don't have to get involved anymore if you don't want to. I'll just tell Jerry to lay off. No sweat. Well, let me ask you something. What would you like me to do? [music playing] Good morning. Jerry. Jerry, you've done it. Everything, it's incredible. No kidding. He's put Henry Norman into every computer in the country, and he's even got a driver's license. Well, how'd you manage that, genius? Well, some states have computerized their motor vehicle files. They don't require fingerprints. So I just patched it in the phone lines. You two been here all night? Love among the rheostats, huh? We got here early this morning. He's been saving your neck while you were in the sack. There you are, Jerry. Henry Norman exists. Social security number, draft card. Draft card? Of course he's over age. KAREN MCMILLAN: You look terrible. Actually, I was studying most of the night. I had to drop Joel off this morning at the hospital. He's got that low blood sugar thing. And I bet you got him loaded? No sweat. They'll change his diet, give him a shot. Well, I have to go to the clinic later on. I'll drop in on him. But right now, we have to have breakfast, right? Right. Hey, listen. I mean, with this, I can get all the girls I want and just charge 'em. Well, don't run up too big a bill. [music playing] You know, he was only 17. He used to pretend he was 19. All his life, he wanted to be older, as old as his mind. Who's gonna tell his parents? I've already called them. I was wondering if you wouldn't go over and collect his things? Sure. Here. You can take this, too. I'll arrange for the shipping. Avery? You go on ahead. I'll be over in a couple of minutes. Come on, Lisa. [music playing] How'd this happen? They gave him insulin. He's been here a dozen times for the same thing, and this time, they gave him insulin. The nurse somehow got the wrong instructions from the computer's daily pharmaceutical list. They've asked me to check on its programming. [music playing] Hey, the manager lives in the back. I'd better go tell him what we have to do. OK. [music playing] [door closing] [music playing] [knocking] AVERY JENSEN: Karen. Karen! Karen. Karen? Karen? [knocking] Are you all right? What happened? It was that dumb effigy Joel made. Oh. Sit down. You know, I think for a minute I thought it was him. The door was open when I got here. Somebody must have been here. Only me. Guess we're all here for the same thing, huh? I was just down in the basement looking through Joel's things, and there's nothing much here except Joel's chess set. What exactly were you looking for? Anything the kid bought on credit. I'm gonna have to send it back. Well, we weren't all exactly that fast on our feet. All right? Fletcher just told us to come over here and pick up some of his things. Well, you don't mind if I indulge in a little self-interest, do you? Wild horses couldn't stop you. LISA: Hey, please. I think we should end this business with Henry Norman. You know, you were never really a part of this whole trip, anyway, except to do your little number. Jerry. JERRY: I've had it with all this sanctimonious jazz. Please, Jerry. Well, if he wasn't such a computer freak, a sick one at that, he would know enough just to bug off when he wasn't wanted! Oh, boy. You are such an incredibly inhuman slob. Only on alternate Thursdays and when I'm nervous! This must be Thursday. Lisa. Silence. Silence. Silence. [music playing] You know he had it up to four moves ahead? I wouldn't have had a chance then. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense, does it? We can create a perfect world in our heads. Joel could. Logical, clean, and pure. And everything works out precisely right. But in the real world, there are too many variables. Yeah, I can't even figure out what went wrong. What? The computer error at the Met Center. I mean, the central computer here should have some memory of its mistake, shouldn't it? I can't find it. Maybe you could. No. I'm a student, not an employee. I'm sorry, Avery. [music playing] Just let me alone, will you? Let me alone! [music playing] Thanks. Miss Soames? You can come in now. Let's see, you're file 4D. You can go ahead into the doctor's office. I'll bring your file in. [music playing] LISA: Break. Break. Broken. Broken. Breath. Breath. Breath. Breath. Burr. Burr. Breath. Breath. [music playing] [whirring noise] Jerry? [music playing] Jerry? Jerry? [music playing] Anybody! Help! Help! [music playing] I'm sorry. For me or Lisa? Or what? I just hate to see you cry. Why? Because I'm showing my emotions? At least I have some, Avery. [music playing] You mean that computer down there can run this whole building? It runs the whole college, Sheriff. We mean those functions which are electrical, mostly-- the lights, security systems, the elevator. And you're the one that runs it. You understand that thing? No. No, I'm just a technician, really. You're going to need somebody on the level of theory. Computers are a new world. Yeah, that's what they tell me. [music playing] I, uh, haven't been able to reach the head of the department, Dr. Burk. Almost everyone is gone for the vacation period. But I did put in a call to Dr. Eddie at Michigan State. He's one of the few who may be able to help. Or that young man, Avery Jensen. He knows as much about these things as anyone else. He doesn't seem very anxious to see us. Avery's a brilliant student, but he's abnormally shy. Also, he knew the dead girl. You know, if there's anything I don't look forward to, it's spending some time with a brilliant student who's abnormally shy. Ah. I saw you lose. You must be all broken up I was in combat, honey. I've seen a lot of people die, maybe too many. I feel lousy about Joel and Lisa. Just haven't hung out any signs, OK? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Jerry. I even snapped at poor Avery. Yeah, poor Avery. Listen, Jerry, I think we should take Henry Norman out of the computer. I can't explain it-- Forget it. But I've got this feeling. Look, I said forget it. I'm here on a scholarship, and they got a funny morals clause. There's not enough money in the account to close out Henry Norman without the whole roof falling in. You get kicked out of school nowadays, you don't get back in anywhere, so we'll just let Henry sleep in the computer for a while, and we'll all just keep our pretty mouths shut. Oh, that's beautiful. That's really beautiful. By any chance, did you happen to explain this to Avery before you sucked him in? Listen, babe, stop worrying about Avery and start worrying about yourself. Stay away from him! Don't tell me what to do. The five of us created Henry Norman. Two thirds of the survivors are standing right here. Now that's two deaths in two weeks connected to the computer. What are you trying to say? That you better face it while you still got a chance. There's only one person has that kind of control over the computers. [music playing] AVERY JENSEN: Do you have anything for a Norman? A Henry Norman? I think it might be special delivery. [music playing] Thank you. [music playing] [footsteps] [music playing] Avery? JERRY: Want a drink? You're gonna need one. Where's Avery? I'm thinking he's gonna be here in about 10 minutes. Keeps a pretty tight schedule, you know, that Avery. How could you do this? Look. KAREN MCMILLAN: What does this mean? Oh, you tell me. Did you find what you were looking for? Go on. Show it to him. I found it in Lisa's slave unit. Why didn't you tell somebody? Like the police or somebody? Maybe because that's a message to the machine, not from it. Jerry, cut it out. Let's see what else you got. Henry Norman. General delivery. A birth certificate? [music playing] Where does it come from? I sent away for it to the Bureau of Records. I just wrote a letter in his name and asked for a copy. Wait a minute, I don't get it. He exists. Look at it. We created him in the computer. But now there's actual documents. I found a transcript in the administration files, his old school records clear back to grammar school. I didn't put any of that in the computer. You gave him things like the degrees, the job record. But not this! I didn't do any of that. [music playing] Something's happened. I tried to erase him. I wiped the memory banks clean. You what? I went back to the computer, and I erased everything. But now it's all back in. I just came from there. It's all laid back just like it was. We can't control him. The computer's thinking in billionths of a second, erasing its own errors simultaneously. We can't do anything about it. Who says that-- that you could have made up some phony documents, huh? And if the program is still in the computers because you never took it out! Why not? Why not? I just don't know why, that's all. I just don't know why! But I'm warning you, Avery! You stay away from me! I am not Joel, and I am not Lisa! So don't mess with me! Well, I'm warning you, Jerry. Keep away from computers, and stay out of that place. Why? What are you afraid I'll find out? Huh? What are you afraid I'll find out? You better come with me. No! Karen. I'm staying. What are you thinking? He's upset. He's a little drunk. He might do anything. He might go to the police, the administration, anything. Well, I can't do anything about that. No, but I can if I go after him. Well, go ahead. [music playing] Burned out. Completely destroyed. And the boy in the morgue doesn't look too good, either. Now, this thing takes in different amounts of electricity, right? Yes, depending on how complex the function. The voltage was too high. There must have been at least 1,000 volts when he touched it. But the regulator-- -Yeah, I know. I know. It's, uh, controlled by the computer. Another accident. Well, we're gonna get other people in the company to work on it, and maybe they can figure something out. Well, if you can't figure it out, I sure can't. All I know is I could have two, maybe three murders here. But I can't prove a thing. Son. Sir. You're the politest murder suspect I've ever had. Get those things off of him. Sorry about those handcuffs, but you look like the quiet kind of fellow might hurt himself. I've never intentionally hurt anyone in my life. Well, son, I'm gonna let you go only 'cause I have to. You know, that brain or computer out there, whatever you call it, seems to be a total mystery to everyone around here but you. And it's killed three people. You knew every one of them. And that last boy, now you didn't like him one bit. You had an argument with him. That much I can prove. Now, what I'm trying to say is one of these days, you're gonna do something. I'm gonna get you. That is, if you don't go over the line into cuckoo land first. Can I go? Yeah. He's withdrawing, pulling back into himself more and more. Doesn't give very many details. His problems apparently started as a child. He has a history of mental illness. He was in an institution for three years, and I've concealed that from everybody. You haven't concealed anything. It's a matter of record. Anybody could have checked the files. You're being too rough on yourself, Karen. As a matter of fact, I knew there was something in his past. He told me in so many words once. I never thought anything of it. Maybe if I had told Jerry. I'm supposed to be objective, aren't I? Trained to be. Then you also know that you can't be objective when it's somebody you care about. No. That's why I asked you to read the file. You seem to understand Avery. OK, let's face facts. He might be sick, very sick. Now, this business about the computers being human, that worries me. But it was through the computer that I found his file. It told me. Or warned me. I don't know which Now, come on, Karen. Computers do what people tell them to do. I'm just a technician, but I know that much. Now, who would want you to see that file? Avery? Avery himself? Who else would he ask to help him? [music playing] KAREN MCMILLAN: Avery? [music playing] I think this is the last place you ought to be. Why? After what happened. Avery? I was hoping you trusted me. Do you? [music playing] I don't know. I think you'd better tell him. I read your file, the one they keep at the psychiatric clinic. Doesn't matter. It does matter. Karen's worried about you, and so am I. We thought perhaps we should contact your parents. My parents are dead. But the file says they're alive. I wrote down their address somewhere. There. This is where we lived 20 years ago. [music playing] My parents are dead. I killed them. [music playing] Avery. Avery! Please, I want to help you. Well, then, let me prove it to you. I'll take you there. [music playing] All right. [music playing] How far is it? Where? The place where you grew up. Oh, it's 150 miles. Is that where it happened? What? Whatever happened that made you sick, made you go into an institution. Nothing happened. I just have to see. I have to show you. House will be all boarded up and nothing there, no life. I don't believe you killed anyone. Not Jerry not with the computer. You watch where you're going! You're driving too fast! You handle him! I'll handle the driving! Do you think you ought to be driving so fast? What? Please slow down He is not a mama's boy. He is a fine boy! And if you were any kind of a man-- You don't need a man! You got your little man in the back seat! You don't need a husband, and I don't need you! I'm sick and tired of you and the kid and the whole-- Hey, you leave Avery out of this! You just leave him alone! Hope it gives you some satisfaction when you grow up to know that you drove your old man right out of-- [screaming] [music playing] KAREN MCMILLAN: What is it? [music playing] Watch out! [music playing] [knocking] [music playing] How's he doing? Well, physically he's fine. We were both very lucky. Hmm. But the other? He just won't communicate to anyone. He just sits there. Art, the police say he tried to commit suicide. But I know he didn't. I know he didn't! What are they gonna do? They're gonna keep him here a while, run some tests. After that, I-- I don't know I don't believe he did it. I won't believe that. Avery? How you feeling? Avery, please speak to us. Avery, you don't have to talk. Just listen. Karen and I, we care about you. And we want desperately for you to get well. This shell of yours is no good. As far as what you believe about the computer, well, I guess I was the one who scoffed. But you know, we haven't been able to find any rational explanation. And someday, we all may have to face the fact that you were right. I don't even know if he can hear you. I'm quitting my job here, going away. But I'll come back if you want me to. I'll keep in touch. You need friends. I want to be one. [music playing] It's very sad. [music playing] You're quitting? Yeah, I'm afraid so. After all this, I got to find something else. Yeah. ART FLETCHER: I'll stay in touch. Thanks. You ought to get away yourself. I can't. I'm partly responsible, you know. [music playing] I checked. His parents were killed in an automobile accident when he was six. And I didn't believe him. But the psychiatric files-- the computer again? You know, in a way, I'm the only one left. I'll say it again. Go. Get away from everything here. [music playing] Here's one I like. And it has nothing whatsoever to do with calculus. Karen, I can think again. I mean clearly. All this week, I've been running equations and logarithms and computations of different kinds through my head. Imagine me practicing thinking. I know a few people who should try. I figured it out about Henry Norman. Oh, Avery, please. I have. I know all about Henry Norman. He's flesh and blood, Karen. He's real. He's alive. Karen, listen to me. I need you. You're the only one I can talk to. And if I don't, it could all slip away. We created a paper man, the five of us, a complete identity, a cloak, a cloak that someone needed desperately, desperately enough to kill three people in order to keep it a secret. Avery, please. Remember that Jerry gave the original programmed to Joel, and after Joel died, no one ever found it again. But when I tried to erase everything from the computer, it all reappeared because whoever had the program put it back in. And my case history sent to you-- someone counted on my cracking up, and I did. I began to think the computer itself was doing it. But it wasn't, Karen. It was a man, a human being. I don't know. I just don't know. And the birth certificate and the school records, we didn't need those, but somebody else did. But it doesn't make any sense. I was involved, too, and nobody's tried to kill me. You weren't a risk. You never worked with computers. You didn't really understand any of this. Well, why? Who would need an identity? Someone who was forced to give up his own. A fugitive-- a fugitive with special skills he couldn't ever use. I know there's a Henry Norman out there, Karen. And I can find him. All I have to do is strip away the cloak, and he'll be there. But I have to get to the master computer for just five minutes. Yes, I'm asking you to help me. I can open the padlock on the window. I know the attendant's routine backwards. Avery. I know what you're thinking. You could be helping a madman, a homicidal madman. Every fact seems to point to that. All I can ask you to do is something that I never could-- forget facts, forget logic, forget everything that seems real, and just trust and believe. [music playing] [alarm ringing] [knocking] Come in. Henry, the Air Force bought every one of your ideas on the new backup system If this thing checks out, you'll be heading the entire project. It'll check out. You know, it seems to me I once heard there was a small company down in Texas working on a project like this, but something happened and they just didn't follow through. Did you ever hear about it? No. Mhm. Yeah. Then there's just one thing that concerns me. You're gonna have to pass one more really intensive security check, so I just hope there isn't anything or anybody-- -Oh, no. Nothing. No one. Just thought I'd mention it. Go on back to work We're all proud of you, Henry. [music playing] [knocking] [music playing] Avery? [music playing] Who's there? [music playing] Art! Oh, Art. ART FLETCHER: I tried your apartment. The police were watching it. I thought I'd try here. I'm so glad you came. I tried to get in touch with you, but you left no forwarding address. I didn't want to be disturbed. I came as soon as I saw the papers. Yeah, Avery. Has he tried to contact you? Well, Art, I helped him escape. Where is he now? KAREN MCMILLAN: I don't know. Why did you do it? I don't know. I wish you'd been there. I didn't know what to do. It's like it's his last link to sanity that there is a real Henry Norman. A real Henry Norman? A fugitive. A fugitive? Do you think that's possible? I don't know. I believed him when I was with him. I just-- I just don't know anything anymore. Now, try to remember, did he have any kind of proof? No, nothing. He just said all he wanted to do was get in the computer room. The computer room? I'm supposed to meet him at 11 o'clock with the keys. [music playing] Did you get the keys? [music playing] [car engine] [tires squealing] [brakes squeaking] [music playing] Police. Stakeout. [music playing] Oh, Art, do you think I'm doing the right thing? You've got to go to him. He needs our faith, our trust. Without that, he's got nothing. Now, we've got to have some kind of a plan. You've got to get out of here, the back way, preferably. I'll see if I can get some kind of diversion for our friend there. [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (ON RADIO): Control, this is station two. Come in. This is Hurley. Go ahead. MALE SPEAKER (ON RADIO): Sheriff, we've got something on that Jensen kid-- a lock, maybe. How good a lock? The best. Exactly where he'll be and when. When? The other car is covering the far side of the campus, Sheriff. Good. Now, you cover the stadium entrance. You stay with me. Well, if he shows up, we've got him. I feel terrible about doing this. I really thought he was innocent. That's the only reason I let her go to him. Hey, Mr. Fletcher, would you mind telling me again exactly what he said? Well, he called just a few minutes after she left, and he sounded wild, deranged. I tried to reason with him. I begged him to turn himself in, to try and get some help. And? He became enraged. He said he killed before, and he'd do it again if they tried to get him back there. After that, I guess my only thoughts were of Karen and how to save her from him. You know, it's kind of like you were telling me to shoot first and then put the pieces together later. I wouldn't want to tell you how to do your job. No, I'm sure you wouldn't. But it anything happens after what I've told you, it is your responsibility. [music playing] Avery! Did you get the key? Yeah. [music playing] Stop right there, Jensen! I didn't tell him. Give me the key. [music playing] Sheriff, don't hurt him. I'll do my best, miss. Don't hurt him! [music playing] Jensen! Don't move or I'll shoot! [music playing] Well, he's not going anyplace. You get someone down here with a key And the head shrinkers! [music playing] It's all over, son You come on, now. It's all right, Sheriff. You're not gonna need that. [music playing] Fine. I'll tell him. Mr. Johnson is on his way to see you. Well, that's not bad, when they come to you. Do you want to go on with this dictation, Mr. Norman? No. Just tell him that I'll see him at the meeting in San Francisco and sign it cordially. Henry, can I talk to you for a minute? What is it, Bob? Well, Henry, I don't quite know how to say this. But, uh, well, these men-- these men tell me they have a report that a Henry Norman, a man who matches your background exactly, was killed a few hundred miles from here yesterday. Killed? Came through in a computer report. A computer report? Well, naturally, considering what you're involved in, that does raise certain questions. Who are they? Well, they're from Washington. They want to question you. That's all I know. All right. Let me get my pipe. [music playing] Henry? Hold it, Norman! [music playing] All right. Just put it down, now. [music playing] Now, why don't you just put it right over here on the desk? Over here on the desk. [music playing] I don't get it. Who was this guy, anyway? [music playing] They just got the government man's report, and I, uh-- well, I felt I owed it to you to come in and tell you about it myself. Now, this Henry Norman-- or as you knew him, Arthur Fletcher-- his real name was Hennessy, Claude Hennessy. He was part owner of a small electronics place down in Texas, kind of a scientific genius. Little bit cracked, too, like most of 'em. Uh, no offense. Anyway, one day he and his partner get into a beef about who's to get credit for something they invented. And right there in the office, right in front of everybody, he shoots him. The people don't do a thing. They just stand there and look and let him walk out of the place. People will do that. Well, nobody ever saw him again. He just disappeared. I guess he came here, and he got this little job, couldn't just sit on it. He wanted to be back in the big time again. I think we know the rest of the story. Thank you, Sheriff. Hey, tell me something. You killed him off with that computer, didn't you? I just programmed in a report of his death. The way we created him is the way he died. So that's what made him, and that's what killed him What'd you put in that report? Just the date and the phrase "accidental death." Nothing more. Why? Well, the report the feds picked up on, the one that sent 'em to check him out, said he jumped from a building. And they got it the day before it really happened. [music playing] [computer clicking] Who started that thing? Oh, it's being activated by another computer somewhere, data seeking. Now they're talking to one another. That's right. You know what I think? Pretty soon, they're not gonna need you. All they're gonna need is another Henry Norman [music playing] What do you think about that? Another Henry Norman. If at first you don't succeed, ha, ha, ha. Yeah, very funny. [music playing] Let's go. [music playing]
