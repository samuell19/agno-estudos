[grunting] My son Wei Fung comes to salute your highness. - Greetings. Long live the emperor. - Long live the emperor. - Arise. - [both] Thank you, sire. Scholar Wei, your son ever work? No, Highness, he's a student. Of various arts. Oh, martial arts? Yes, he can fight. Good, Scholar Wei. As it would seem, he has skill... ...in many disciplines. We may, perhaps, have use for him. We'll discuss it. So then, you may withdraw. Sire, as you command. Wei Fung? Sire? There's a priest here, and a Mongol fighter. I've asked them to test your martial arts skill. [Wei] Sire... Sire. Let the contest begin! Sir. [knuckles cracking] [yelling] [body hits ground] [groaning] [man] Good! Very good technique. Thank you for your praise, sire. I am honored. Wei Fung, come here. Sire... - Wei Fung. - Yes, sire. General Wu plans to overthrow me. You've heard that? I'm always absorbed in my studies. I've heard nothing. I hear he's plotting with the remnants of the Ming rebels. I believe that. Those few men have no strength. But there is one clan that is well organized. My Lord, which clan? It's the Tien clan. They are conspiring with Wu to commence a rebellion. There is no doubt about it. In that case, why not send troops? [sighs] Because before I attack, I want proof. Lists and names of everybody. You are wise, sire. So I want you to go to Tien clan. Spy on them and get the evidence. I have no experience in such things. [laughing] But you are talented. You can do it. If there's anybody can, you can succeed. You'll be rewarded. My Lord, l... - My orders. - Sire. You are to proceed to Chi Ping and get the proof of the Tiens' treachery. When you have, you will report here at once. Sire. But still, if you fail after three months, then your father will be stripped of his posts. After six months, your whole family will be jailed. After a year, I will behead them! TlAN'S TOWN FlVE SUN MANOR No! I've been a teacher now for years. - But such a pupil? - Teacher, you must go! No respect? I don't deserve that. - Please. - Not at my age. Teacher, now you know what she's like. - Now, come on. - No, I won't go! I must speak my mind! Or else I'll never teach again! I think you ought to give up teaching. Just retire and enjoy your old age! [exclaims] You! How dare you do that to me? You wicked young girl! You've no respect, beating up your own teacher! Hey, I didn't hit you. I just touched you. Quite lightly. [groaning] But you're so weak, you can't stand up! [laughing] You... You hit me again! Go on, or I'll beat you! Hey, go on. You deserve this. Deserved it? But why is that? - You're a teacher? - Yes, I'm a teacher. Oh, dear. Would Confucius have lived so long - if he had pupils like her? - Forget Confucius. Seems to me... ...you've taught her right and wrong. Of course. But it still doesn't appear that she's learned. - What? - She's rude. No respect. She wants to hit you. What was that? That proves you taught badly. You didn't do your job, at least not properly. Tell me, you, do you think I'm right? Huh? Nonsense! It was all her fault! She wouldn't learn her lessons. What could I do? [grunting] She's so arrogant! Thank you! Let's get out of here! Come on! Hey! Take this! [all clamoring] Give me my umbrella. Hey! What's your name? Tell me. First Wei, then Fung. That's a strange way to put it. But accurate. My name's Wei Fung. So it's Wei Fung. Why not just say so? I say what I want. - Always. - Hey. You haven't asked my name. - Go on. - My name's Chi-Chi. My last name is Tien. That's Tien Chi-Chi. They say that you're the girl who's got the nasty temper. [Wei] That right? Who says? I'll beat 'em up! Doesn't matter. Just now, that teacher that you threw out... They say he's the 1 8th one. Don't like him. Even so, you shouldn't hit him. You say that, I'll hit you! - No you won't. - Why not? Hey! I'm not your teacher. So you can't. Just behave yourself. Hey, are you a teacher? Well, then, I'll engage your services, all right? No thanks. Wei Fung, why not? You've no respect. You just called me Wei Fung instead of Teacher Wei. Don't want to. All right. I'll go. Fatty? You'll teach me? No. Right. If you refuse, then you'll be punched! Three times! And what's more... ...you leave town hopping on one leg. Teacher Wei, I think you should take the job. I won't. Hey, teacher, please teach me. Right. But always respect your teacher. Be polite. And listen to him. And study hard. Also... Never hit teacher, right? - [chuckles] Right. - [giggling] FLYlNG DRAGON Uncle Chung, I've found a new teacher! - This is... - Teacher Wei. Tell me, where's Ma? Chi-Chi! Don't bother your uncle. Why aren't you studying? Ma! Grand Aunt! Yes, I have a new teacher. New teacher? And Mr. Wong? Old fool. Useless. Threw him out. Chi-Chi, that was naughty. When your granddad hears, he'll be mad. Granddad? No he won't. I'll go and tell him now. Hey... Teacher Wei... My mother, Grand Aunt. How do you do? [man] The master comes! Repairs to the temple are completed. Also, we should have a good harvest this year. Granddad! Good morning, uncles! Good morning! Granddad, listen... [no audio] Granddad, have some tea. Teacher Wei, the Tiens are a big clan. You will be treated well here. - Thank you, sir. - Hmm. But still, our clan rules are very strict. Both the study and the gardens, these are open to you. But anywhere else in this place you may not enter. I see. Tien Chung. Take him inside. Sir. Granddad, I'll go too! Chi-Chi... Chi-Chi! Please... Father, you spoil her. [chuckling] Dad, that teacher... He does seem a bit young. Right. Chi-Chi is so naive. I'm scared. Yes, I know. He's younger than the others. But they failed. So maybe he can succeed. I do hope so. CROUCHlNG TlGER And this room is Uncle Tien's study. Those weapons... Are they all his? He likes to practice martial arts. - Oh. - Please. PHOENlX DANCE - Feng Wu? - My mother lives behind there. Teacher, this way. GALLOPlNG HORSE These rooms belong to your fourth uncle? Teacher, please. Teacher Wei, that chamber adjoining the pond, that's reserved for the ladies. - And this is... - This is the study. Teacher Wei, please go in. Uncle Chung, you can go. I'll take over. All right, see you. [grunting] [chuckles] Hey, teacher. You have to be more careful. If you're not, you'll fall in the water. - Yeah. - Please. Also... This place here, I use as my own playground. Where I practice kung fu! Listen, don't hit me! - [giggles] - Hey... And this is your room here. Hey, this desk is for us. Now let's see how you're gonna teach me. Open the book and repeat: "Mencius went to see the king." Mencius went to see the king. "The king said..." The king said... "l am glad you came, sir." You must repeat. Just look at the book, not at me. Hey, you're strange. You know? Strange? In what way? Because... you're different. - From whom? - The other teachers. - The ones I threw out. - Oh. Well, perhaps I'll be better, too. Let's go on. "The king said, 'l am glad that you came, sir."' The king said, "l am glad that you came, sir." "lt may be that you can help me." It may be that you can help me. "Mencius said, 'What do you mean?"' Hey! Hey! - Hey, teacher! - Hey, no more boxing! Why not? One day I'll teach you. You're to study, not to box. [yelling] - [groans] - [Chi-Chi giggling] Miss, you'll kill me! Hey, get up! Hey, miss, your granddad, now, he wants you to learn and not to fight. Well, sure, but still, if I hadn't practiced, I wouldn't have developed enough strength to throw my teachers out. Hey, listen, to learn does bring its advantages. - Like what? - Study increases your intelligence. Also... Hey! ...matures you. Trains your mind. You understand... ...filial piety, things like... ...clan etiquette, family, loyalty... But still, it won't make you a fighter. Well, you believe that you can fight real well. That right? Mmm... Right. Come on. All right. Come on. Hey. All I'll do is test your strength. Strength? Can you throw this leaf... ...over the bridge? Well, that's easy. What's wrong? It's quite light. Can't you make it? You beaten? Let's see you do it. And what does that prove? Well, I threw over the leaf. And some twig, too. And without any strength. You get it? Oh! I can see what you're getting at. What you did is to use nature. You used gravity, not your strength. You used the natural forces! Right, and things like that can be learned... ...if you study. All right. Now, let's study before your grandpa comes. Don't worry, he approves of kung fu. In fact, he taught me all mine. - Your granddad, he fights well? - Mm. What style? It's called the Shadow Technique. The Shadow Technique? Just now, was that what you were using? Oh, no, it's like... [grunting] Ow! Ah! When anyone comes into Grandfather's hands... ...they can never escape. That's the technique that he's taught me. It's good. But I've only learned a little bit yet. And your family, do they all know this style? Oh, no, Granddad said, of all the clan, only I would be taught to use this technique. Uh... And cousin Tang, but he's in Han Wei. Hey, what you thinking? Well, tell me! It's time that you could write. Right. I have to write? I have to write? Hey, come on. Like me, smaller. Well, you show me how, then. Keep your mind on your work. Take care. Here. Hey. No. Hold like this. Hey, keep upright. Watch that. Come on, relax your hand. - Relax. Come on. - [exclaims] Come on. Here. Look at it. Hey, miss. Do some reading. Stop boxing. I don't want to read. I want to write. Right. Come in then. But after three months, your father will be stripped of all his posts. After six months, your family will be put in jail. After one year, they will be killed! [grunting] [groans] Teacher! Are you all right? Sure. It seemed like such a beautiful night. I thought I'd stroll... Are you hurt? All right. Night. Mr. Chung. Goodnight. Granddad? Chi-Chi. I asked you here to tell you something. What's that? Your teacher means us harm. He must die. Not Wei Fung! Granddad! He is a Ching agent. I don't get it. Chi-Chi... It's time you knew the truth. You're old enough now. This clan... is headquarters... of the anti-Ching movement. That man who comes here each month... He's our contact with the rebels. And he brings us all the stuff to equip the militia units... ...and the lists of the new recruits. Wei Fung has been sent here by the Chings to spy on us. Tien Chung investigated his background. He means... ...to destroy our clan! Can't be! He can't be a spy! Chi-Chi... You're too young. And too inexperienced. I shall take care of him. No, you can't kill him! Ma, don't let them do it! Don't let them! Master... This thing... [sobbing] Granddad! Chi-Chi... The fate of our movement depends on this. We must do it. Granddad... Granddad, please don't kill him! Chi-Chi, but if we don't... ...then he'll kill us. Each one of us. He can't fight. How could he? The Manchu king, he can't fight. But even so, he's ordered many deaths. I don't care! Granddad, don't kill him! Why not? Because... I... Iove the man. A good reason. But not worth a whole nation. - Not one man. - Granddad! You'll soon forget him. I know that. There'll be others. No, I won't forget him! - Because... - Because what? I... I... Speak! All right! You kill him... ...then you'll kill my lover! Lover? Chi-Chi, you haven't... Mm. So you can't kill him! Chi-Chi, you're so young! How could you do this? Granddad, so many hours... ...we were alone. That's enough! You...! Chi-Chi, if he really is a Ching agent, he has to go! - Right! - Right! - He must die! - He must die! [sobbing] Granddad, if you kill him... ...then kill me as well! [weeping] All right, stop crying. I will spare his life. But still, he must live here as one of our family. And he may never leave the village. Can you insure that he'll agree? Oh, yes, I'm sure he will! Granddad, I'll go tell him! - Prepare the wedding. - [both] Yes! - Prepare the wedding. - [both] Yes! [traditional music playing] [woman] The groom offers Master the tea. [woman] The bride offers Master the tea. Granddad! [laughing] Thank you. Here, put it on her. Chi-Chi, the jade is a gift for you. I hope you and Wei Fung will live here forever. [man] Down on your knees! Imperial orders! By royal decree, Wei Jing Yuan is stripped of his official posts! Let all officials know this. Thank you, sir. Wei Fung, where is he? Chamberlain, what's the reason? It's the emperor's orders. The message says General Wu has formed some new groups, in the south and in the north, too. Yes. There's the list of names. My Lord, guard it well, sir. Bao Jiang, look after this list. - Sit. - Thank you. You tell General Wu we will await his orders. Where are you going at this hour? Just strolling. To relax. Can't sleep? I was thinking of my parents. I've been here nearly four months. I miss my folks. Your folks? We're your folks now. Right. But still, I miss my parents. I must go and see them. Chi-Chi, will you come, too? Go with you? Granddad won't agree. Why not? He's a reasonable man. And sympathetic. He knows what a wife's duty should be. Chi-Chi, go on. Please, ask him. The emperor's orders! Wei Jing Yuan and his family are to be imprisoned immediately! - Arrest them! - [man] Thank you, sir. Husband! [crying] Take them away! Chi-Chi... It's been two months, what's happening? On what? On our trip! I forgot! What's that? You forgot? I'll ask soon. No need, I'll ask him. Wei Fung! Wei Fung! Granddad, I want to ask you something. I... I want... Well, what is it? Tell me. Granddad, I left home six months ago. My parents must be worried. Don't know where I am. So then... Parents? Where do they live? The capitol. Hmm. And so you want to leave? - That right? - Yes, and take Chi-Chi with me. See my home, meet my parents. Also, l... You sure? Sure I am. I won't be long. Just a few days. No longer. All right. You are to go. Tell me, when will you leave? Soon as I can. I think... Well, tomorrow? Right. Go on. Pack your things and we'll see you off. Thank you, sir! I'll tell Chi-Chi. Chi-Chi, I told you. There wasn't any problem. You asked him? Sure, and he agreed. He said that he'd come and see me off. - Tomorrow morning. - He said that? Mm-hm. Chi-Chi, what's wrong? [crying softly] Listen, darling, I'll take you and meet my parents. And then we'll come straight back. Wei Fung, you don't understand! I don't care what he said. He won't let you leave alive! That can't be! Your granddad was most polite. Well, he intends... You must pass the five posts. He knows that way you're bound to die. One thing is sure... He's going to kill you! [Chi-Chi crying] Chi-Chi, what are we gonna do? It's simple. There's no choice. You're my husband. We live or die together. Chi-Chi, l... Now then, we must break out tonight. - Our only hope! - Tonight? - You sure? - I am. Change your clothes. Why? They're lighter. Won't slow us down. My Lord, Chi-Chi loves Wei Fung. I'm scared. She'll go with him. Then what? Well, she knows our clan rules. I shall remind her. What happens if she insists? What then? Then she will have to be punished! - Why the rope? - To get over the wall. You take the rattan shield. Now, the first post. Who's on that? - Uncle Chung. - Tien Chung? Uncle Chung. I am sorry. This is my duty. I must do it. Uncle Chung, couldn't you help us out? [yelling] - [Chi-Chi] Get out! - Right! - Go on! - All right! Chi-Chi, come on! Let's go! Uncle Chung. Mistress. Master. Take care. Wei Fung... Wei Fung! Why didn't you say you knew kung fu? I'll tell you later. - Next one is fourth uncle? - Right. He seems a bit impatient. He's like an angry horse. And vicious, too. You must watch him. Be careful. His swordplay's terrific. So then we'll try and hold him off long as we can, then escape through the courtyard. Come along! Chi-Chi, you'll really go with him? He is my husband. It's my duty. But still, you wouldn't know that. Damn you! Chi-Chi, he is a bachelor. They don't know too much. When did you learn to fight? When he started taking some lessons from me. No girl would marry that bad temper! It's all right, we'll fix that! Don't think he can change. Make him a eunuch. [grunting] Chi-Chi, run now! Right! Hurry! [grunts] - Sister! - Brother. Withdraw. We shall handle this. I won't! Listen. It's our business now. Please withdraw. Thank you, both! Thank you! - Wei Fung, let's go! - Hi-ya! Ma! You forget. It's my post. Ma, please let us go! Ma! Move back! Ma! [gasps] Chi-Chi! It's wax! Thank you very much, Mother! Don't thank me. It was your great aunt's idea. Thank you, Aunt! You get up. Yes. Chi-Chi... We both have known... ...what it's like to lose a husband. But we're afraid... ...you won't get through. The next post is very tough. Only one way. Hsang... You must help them. Or they will lose. - Help them? How? - She is your daughter. If you don't, then who will? Go on. Let's go. Sister, please don't plead for them. Brother, for my sake, please let them through. Chi-Chi, she can pass through. But as for Wei Fung, well, he stays. You know they won't agree to that. Well, in that case, they're gonna have to fight their way through. Uncle, excuse me! [grunts] [grunts] - Run! - Uncle! Right, you can pass by me... ...but still, not your granddad. We'll see. My ma will help us. - Chi-Chi, l... - Ma? Ma, please, try and intercede for us. Right, drop the arms. Brother, excuse us. Come. [Chi-Chi] Granddad... I thought you told me you'd leave tomorrow. Granddad, we will be back. When you come back... ...our village here will be surrounded by Ching troops. You're wrong! Chi-Chi, now, you belong to the Tiens. You shouldn't leave us like this. Granddad, I am a Tien. But so is Wei Fung now. We wouldn't harm the clan. Besides... Granddad, you love me! Well, in that case, you shouldn't leave like this. Granddad... All we want is to go and see his parents. Listen, remember what I said when I spared him. And you agreed! But still... Wei Fung is my husband. You insist on this? Granddad, forgive me! You...! You're not fit to wear that! Granddad! Master! Master, since I'm a widow... ...I know just what Chi-Chi's feeling. Remember, she is your granddaughter. I'm sure she and Wei Fung wouldn't harm the Tiens. I beg of you. Let them leave! - [grunts] - [cries out] She's not my grandchild! And he isn't my grandson-in-law! Take your weapon! Oh, Granddad! Master! Quick! [both grunting] Granddad! [gasping] [shouting] Granddad! Granddad! - Daughter? - Master, let them go! [yells] Shadow Technique! [Chi-Chi gasps] Chi-Chi! Chi-Chi! Wei Fung, run fast! Wei Fung, run fast! [cries out] [yells] Go on! Go on! Go on! [Chi-Chi gasps] Chi-Chi! Guards! [all shouting] Get him! [dogs barking] - Get the horses! - [man] Right! [whinnies] Yah! Brother, he's hiding here! - Bring the archers. - Archers! Kill! Get him! [hollering] Strange... Where's the body? It hasn't come up yet. Anyway, he must be dead. Let's go. Come on! [bird calling] [chittering] Shadow... ...Technique! [shouting] [wood creaking] [shouting] [Chung] Please... Please. Uncle Chung. What...? Wei Fung! I know what the Tien clan rules are. So I came back, as I promised. You tell your master. Tell the master! And lock the gates! [both whimpering] Well, now. - How's things? - You're not dead! Take a weapon. [groans] [yells] [gasping] [grunts] Well, now, you're just the same. Still so bad-tempered. Chi-Chi was right. You are just like a horse. Well, here's the mule, rolling on the ground! [yelling] All right. Now, do your best! Exert your strength. [groans] [gasping] Who would have thought that you'd come back? I promised. I said that I would. Well, now... How many Ching men have you brought with you? None. I've come here to avenge Chi-Chi and her mother. Avenge what? That's Tien's affair! And not yours! But Chi-Chi was a Wei! I don't recognize the marriage... ...because there's no blood relation of mine would ever marry a Ching traitor! Well, now, why are you waiting? I want Chi-Chi's pendant! Is that a fact? Come and get it, if you can. Right. I'm very interested to test your skill. Not bad. What's that style? It's new. It's mine. Mantis. [Tien groans] The list! But how? The reason I came... was to get this. [screams] [gasping] Scholar Wei, you taught him well. I drink to you. Thank you, sir. My Lord, the credit in all of this business should go to my son. Please reward him first. Highness, my father comes first. - No, he comes first. - No, he does... - He comes first. - You are both a credit to us. - Father and son. - [both] Sir. Scholar Wei, you have a fine son there. - Does you credit. - Thank you. - Long live the Ming! - Dad! Wei Fung... We yielded to these Chings only to oppose them! And throw them out! Dad! But you have killed a Ming hero! You're a disgrace to all of our family! You must die, you damn traitor! Get him! [all shouting] Stop this! I've poisoned both our drinks! So then... we... [gasping] We will all die together! - That way, the Mings will... - Dad! [groaning] Scholar Wei, why did you do it? Tyrant! I tell you... No matter what you do... You'll never kill all the heroes! [gasping]
