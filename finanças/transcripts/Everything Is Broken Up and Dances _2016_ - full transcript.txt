It'll draw people ﻿Yeah... ﻿And what's the deal with just "Rotem"? ﻿You don't get it, do you? ﻿It's self-branding. Like, say, "Maccabi". ﻿Everyone else uses their last name.

Really. ﻿Sorry. ﻿I like your fashion statement. ﻿You've got something going there. ﻿What? ﻿Don't light a candle for me... ﻿No, no... ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no... ﻿You better erase what you wrote ﻿He who laughs last laughs best ﻿I want to laugh... ﻿And then it came back to me. -What? ﻿Before Nony went to Gaza, on the day that... -Yes. ﻿He had a thing with a girl, while that song was playing. ﻿Okay, and do you know why he calls himself Amnon? ﻿Nony is calling himself Amnon? ﻿Amnon is my brother's name. ﻿I named Nony after my brother. ﻿Shlomi, ﻿it's okay. It's not necessarily related. ﻿All his life... ﻿people told him how much he looks like Amnon. ﻿Shlomi, we'll get to that in a minute, okay? ﻿You said he sang this morning, right? ﻿Yes, the same song as yesterday. -He sang? ﻿Yes. ﻿Amnon was a singer. ﻿He was killed in the Yom Kippur War. ﻿That's interesting. ﻿That's very interesting. ﻿Now we have to fill the void that Amnon left. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I think you should tell him about Amnon, ﻿as if he is really him. ﻿What he did, things he liked, ﻿what he aspired to do, things like that. ﻿Wouldn't it be easier to just make him Nonyagain? ﻿At this point, that won't get us anywhere. ﻿I'm hoping that through this new personality ﻿we'll eventually find our way to Nony. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Nony is in a state of complete denial. ﻿He's created a new persona in the form of your brother Amnon. ﻿This is outrageous! ﻿It's too much! ﻿What should I tell him? ﻿Talk to his parents about Amnon. ﻿Then tell some of that to Nony, and some about your own lives. ﻿Give him some background. ﻿Remember what we said? -Of course. ﻿His uncle Amnon... -Got it. ﻿Remember? -Yeah. ﻿How's it going, Amnon? ﻿This is Gilad, he's a friend, he's okay. ﻿So what's going on here? ﻿It's interesting here. ﻿Amnon's here. ﻿Amnon, remember how you played at the Levontin, ﻿at the Third Ear, at all kinds of bars? ﻿You even played at the Barby club. ﻿Barby, Levontin, what does it matter? ﻿Then you moved to New York. ﻿New York? Where'd you get that from? ﻿That's what they said. -Is it? ﻿You met a girl there, Cindy Crawford. ﻿Cindy Crawford?! Are you kidding? ﻿It's just a name. Keep going. ﻿Is he getting any of this? ﻿Then you broke up with her and you came back to Israel, ﻿and you kept performing, you had lots of songs, ﻿and you almost made an album. ﻿Almost. ﻿You never released an album. You were always the producer. ﻿You produced albums for famous musicians as Rami Fortis ﻿Yeah, I remember. -See, he remembers. ﻿He remembers that. ﻿Yeah, you did a great job there. Amazing. ﻿You never made an album but you almost signed with Nitzan Zeira once. ﻿Once? You almost signed with him a few times. ﻿What? ﻿Isn't that your story? ﻿Maybe we should play something? ﻿Let's play something. ﻿Come on, hold my hand tight ﻿And we'll go on a mystery tour tonight ﻿We'll hug the teddy bear, we'll draw clouds ﻿We'll pick up guns and start up a fight... ﻿He behaves like someone who's suffering from a dissociative disorder. ﻿It's a classic case. I think it's fascinating. ﻿A psychotic breakdown plus PTSD. ﻿You're playing God. That's dangerous. ﻿As if our success rate with other patients is so amazing. ﻿You know the story about the prince who wow: wsgwo?^^“ ﻿Rings a bell. ﻿There once was a prince who thought he was a turkey. -Okay. ﻿He sat under the table naked, eating seeds. ﻿Then a healer came to treat him and the king was so desperate he let him try. ﻿Okay. -The healer stripped naked, sat under the table and ate seeds. ﻿After a while the healer asked the prince: "Who are you?" ﻿The prince said: "I'm a turkey." ﻿The healer said: "So am I." ﻿But he isn't a turkey. ﻿I want to try to reach him this way. ﻿You're a sick man. ﻿I'll go along with you. ﻿But if this turns to be a farce I won't back you up. ﻿You'll face it alone. ﻿So what are your plans, Amnon? ﻿I don't know, I guess I'll walk around a little. You know. ﻿Want me to come along? ﻿No, ﻿I'll mingle. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿Sure I'm sure. ﻿All right. -Ciao. ﻿Ciao-ciao... ﻿Gimme a beer, babe. ﻿What? ﻿What kind of beer do you have? ﻿We don't sell beer, this is a CD store. ﻿Hey, Amnon. Excuse me, I... Just a second. ﻿And who are you? ﻿Want a beer? ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Death is fairly certain, it lurks around the corner ﻿It doesn't reap discriminately ﻿It will not be late to the date that you made ﻿Don't light a candle for me... ﻿I'll be right back. ﻿Hey, Yuval. -Hey. ﻿Just a sec, sweetheart. ﻿How's it going? -Not bad. ﻿I need a favor. -Talk to me. ﻿I don't think so. I'll ﻿be with him. ﻿It'll be fine. ﻿You give me your word? ﻿I'll play with him. It won't be amazing, but you know... ﻿It's a favor. ﻿Cool. ﻿Thanks, man. You're the best. ﻿Bye. ﻿Well? -Well, Amnon? ﻿What's up with that weirdo? -We gotta get going. ﻿How do I look? ﻿You look great. ﻿Great, really. ﻿Am I pretty? -Sure. ﻿You look good. Let's go. ﻿Amnon, ﻿get up and sing. ﻿You wanted to perform, didn't you? ﻿Don't call me up to the stage like that. ﻿What? ﻿Call me up on the mic. ﻿Call you up on the mic? -Yeah. ﻿Is the sound on? ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... Amnon. ﻿Amnon! ﻿This song is called "Don't light a candle for me." ﻿One, two, three... ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿You better erase what you wrote ﻿He who laughs last laughs best - I want to laugh ﻿Don't write me any eulogies ﻿There's nowhere to go, don't change your clothes ﻿Give the bouquet you bought to someone else... ﻿Turn down his guitar and push the effect on his voice. ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Death is fairly certain, it lurks around the corner ﻿It doesn't reap to order ﻿It will be late to the date that you made ﻿Don't light a candle for me ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿There's no hurry ﻿Don't light a candle for me, no no ﻿Do not... ﻿Hello? ﻿Fine. ﻿Hold on, I'll ask him. ﻿Amnon, do you want to play again tomorrow? ﻿He should pay us. ﻿He says he wants money. ﻿Will 200 shekels do it? ﻿It's a deal. ﻿Great, it's a deal. ﻿Ladies and gentlemen, ﻿the one and only... Amnon. Amnon. ﻿Give it up for Amnon! ﻿Fuck you. ﻿Give it up for Amnon! ﻿Fuck you. Amnon... Amnon... Amnon... ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Amnon loves you. ﻿Amnon doesn't love you. ﻿Amnon loves you. ﻿Amnon doesn't love you. ﻿Amnon loves you. ﻿Do you love Amnon? ﻿This pub is fucking awesome ﻿It's the best pub in Tel Aviv ﻿People come from all around ﻿From the country and the suburbs ﻿The journalists all drink here... ﻿Lets hear it for... Amnon! ﻿Everyone knocks back ﻿At least four drinks ﻿Give it up for Amnon! ﻿This place doesn't have regular hours ﻿Within a week you'll be squirting, blood... ﻿Get off the stage. -Hey! ﻿Take your hands off me! ﻿Hey, it's Cindy.

What are you doing here? ﻿I've come to check on Nony in his natural state. ﻿His parents are outside, they want to see him ﻿but I thought I should come up alone first. ﻿Hello. ﻿Hello, Amnon. ﻿How are you? ﻿Good, I see you remember me. ﻿Yes, you're the doctor. ﻿Who's she? ﻿My girlfriend. ﻿Pleased to meet you. Anna. ﻿Will you stop with this "Anna" already? ﻿He thinks she's Cindy Crawford. Long story. I ﻿see. ﻿I understand your music's doing well too. ﻿Amnon, can I ask you a question? ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Your parents are waiting outside. ﻿Can I tell them to come upstairs? ﻿What happened? ﻿What did he say? ﻿His parents are downstairs. ﻿Don't you want to see them? ﻿What? ﻿"Amnon is back!" ﻿Hello? ﻿Rotem? -Yes. ﻿Hi, it's Nitzan Zeira. ﻿Nitzan? ﻿What a surprise. How are you? -I'm fine. Listen, ﻿I want to talk to you about that guy you brought over. ﻿Yeah, Nony. Amnon. -Exactly. ﻿I don't know how to reach him, ﻿but I remembered that you' taking care of him. ﻿More or less. -Good. ﻿I want to release a single of his. ﻿He's got a real spark. ﻿You realize he isn't a musician? ﻿So what? He's got something fresh, so... ﻿When I realized he's for real I got interested. ﻿I'm glad to hear it. I'll tell him. ﻿Good. Do you want to play with him? ﻿Of course. He can't even play, I play all the guitar parts. ﻿Oh, really? Sounds good. ﻿But I like that rough sound of his. ﻿What rough sound? That's the sound of someone who can't play. ﻿Okay, I get it. Let's meet next week and put out a single. ﻿Okay. -Talk to him and get back to me. Figure out what song you want to do. ﻿Okay, thanks. -Great. Ciao. -Ciao. ﻿Start playing. ﻿You mean the song ﻿Whatever you want. ﻿What does he want? ﻿He wants you to play the guitar to get you tuned up. ﻿Ah... ﻿I'll do overdubs later. -Okay. Great. ﻿Start singing. ﻿While I play? -However you want. ﻿Are you recording this? -Not yet. ﻿Then what the hell are we doing?! ﻿Amnon, relax. He has to set up the sound. ﻿Lennon did the same thing, believe me. ﻿Okay. Try singing. ﻿They slammed the door in his face... ﻿Is that how you're gonna sing ﻿What kind of question is that? -Is that your key? ﻿How should I know the key? Are you a nutcase? ﻿Can you sing it like you do in concert? -Yeah. ﻿Put my guitar in the speakers, okay? ﻿Okay, got it. -Okay, Amnon? ﻿Cool, but let's start recording. -Okay, go ahead. ﻿Ready when you are. ﻿I was born ready, motherfucker. ﻿Okay. Three, two, one... ﻿They slammed the door in his face ﻿They said he was on drugs ﻿They called him a thousand names ﻿And shamelessly ﻿They screamed like sickos... ﻿Number one on the charts... ﻿"Amnon. A War Machine." ﻿Nony, or Amnon, you decide what you'd like to call him, ﻿has reached a place few artists ever reached. ﻿He broke the rules of the game they call art ﻿and created a new kind of art, ﻿art on the border of life and death. ﻿Rumor has it that Amnon can't even play. ﻿He's a great guy. ﻿He defended his country and now he's a singer. ﻿What's wrong with that? ﻿Did he commit a crime? ﻿He refuses to see us. ﻿And shamelessly ﻿They screamed like sickos ﻿This generation is rotten ﻿It looks so pathetic ﻿This generation is sad ﻿They did all sorts of experiments on him ﻿Let me play some! ﻿What's your problem? -Nothing, I feel like drumming. ﻿And shamelessly ﻿They screamed like sickos ﻿This generation is rotten... ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿It's crazy, they love him! ﻿It's so weird. ﻿And it's from nothing. From a guy who lost his mind. ﻿What I don't get is, like, ﻿does the audience not realize it's all cover versions? ﻿It's not like they're his songs. ﻿So what? ﻿He's got something special, I guess. ﻿Yeah... but... There's something twisted about it. ﻿Why? ﻿Shit! ﻿Look at what he did to me. ﻿What is that? ﻿He wet the whole bed. Psycho! ﻿What is it, pee? ﻿And he did not even wake up. ﻿I'm sorry, Anna. ﻿Tell him I'm sorry. ﻿You don't want to tell him yourself? ﻿No. ﻿I can't do this anymore. ﻿I love him. ﻿Come on, Anna. -But I'm not his mother. ﻿Come on, sit down. -Come sit with us and then we'll decide, Anna. -No! ﻿It's enough! You think I'm kidding? ﻿Smell this! -Calm down. ﻿It's pee! ﻿Tell him I went back to Germany. ﻿Okay, Anna. I'm sorry. ﻿Goodbye, Anna. ﻿She's so fuckin' hot. ﻿What are we going to do with that nut? ﻿What can we do? ﻿I'm going to Germany. ﻿Forget about her. ﻿Did she leave because of you? ﻿Let it go, Amnon. ﻿now if you fucked her! Now! ﻿Anna! ﻿Anna! Anna! ﻿Anna... Anna.. ﻿Anna... ﻿Yes, it doesn't sound like he's doing well. ﻿These symptoms really are troubling. ﻿Do you want to ask his parents to take him back? ﻿I'm considering it. ﻿It's your decision. But I do think Nony is about to have a breakthrough. ﻿It'll take a little more patience, but it's coming. ﻿I've seen these symptoms many times before. ﻿Let him find the way through his subconscious, through Amnon. ﻿Okay. I'll try. ﻿What did he say? ﻿He says Nony is about to have a breakthrough. ﻿Are you talking to me? ﻿Are you talking to me? ﻿Are you talking to me?! ﻿...and in about half an hour, Amnon will play at the Levontin Club... ﻿This generation is pathetic ﻿This generation is rotten... ﻿This generation is sad... ﻿Amnon! ﻿Aah! ﻿You came for a reason. ﻿I don't understand, Amnon... What do you mean? ﻿"There is no end to childhood"! ﻿Come on stage with me. -No, I'm sorry. ﻿I have a boyfriend. ﻿Amnon! ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Let's play something different. ﻿What? ﻿Want to hear something different? -Yeah! ﻿What do you want to sing? ﻿"As long as we're alone". ﻿Can you play it? ﻿Can you play it? ﻿What? -Wait a second. ﻿It's not like in the past ﻿It's not like they say ﻿Everything is still, ﻿Frozen... ﻿Sadness, rain, love, ﻿Make no difference ﻿Something is dead, something is over ﻿Distant love in a subway ﻿Across a London square ﻿She writes me: It's kind of cold now ﻿When are you coming? ﻿Millions of people alone ﻿They should be on the move ﻿So we get warm, so we don't freeze, so we don't go mad ﻿Millions of people alone ﻿They should be on the move ﻿So we get warm, so we don't freeze, so we don't go mad... ﻿Aren't you going to ask me in? ﻿I just want to talk to you. ﻿I have homework to do. ﻿Give me five minutes, I won't bother you. ﻿I swear, knock wood... ﻿My parents' apartment. It used to be my grandma's. ﻿Fuck. Nice. ﻿Thanks. Something to drink? ﻿No. ﻿ilia ﻿Yeah, coffee. ﻿What kind? ﻿Got any Turkish? -I think so. ﻿So where's that boyfriend of yours? ﻿I don't know. At work, I guess. ﻿And... do you love him? ﻿I don't know, it's still new. ﻿I can't find any Turkish. Do you want instant? ﻿I don't believe in anything instant. ﻿I'll have tea. -"I'll have tea". ﻿What's so funny? -Nothing. You're funny. ﻿Sugar? -One. ﻿I've been thinking about you lately. ﻿What were you thinking? ﻿The truth? ﻿Nothing but the truth. ﻿That we need to be together. ﻿Okay. ﻿Well? ﻿Well? ﻿So we're... ﻿are we together now? ﻿Get out please. ﻿Get out now! ﻿I'm not leaving. ﻿She could've called the police. ﻿But she didn't. -So what? ﻿So she felt something too. ﻿Yeah, she felt you were a psycho. ﻿Psycho? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Psycho. ﻿Dude, ﻿you're just jealous. I﻿'m jealous? ﻿Yeah. ﻿You know what? ﻿Go fuck yourself. ﻿What do you want? ﻿Go fuck yourself! ﻿Go fuck yourself, motherfucker! ﻿Motherfucker! ﻿You don't appreciate anything people do for you! ﻿What have you done for me? ﻿What have you done for me? ﻿You're an idiot. ﻿Dude, I don't understand what you... ﻿No, huh? -What do you want? Uh, uh, uh, uh... ﻿No, huh? You don't understand. ﻿You remember this! ﻿I've had it with him. -What are you gonna do? ﻿I don't know, but I'm going nuts. ﻿Call his dad, Rotem. ﻿It's over. ﻿You tried. ﻿Hello? ﻿Hey, Shlomi. -What's up, buddy? ﻿I'm okay. I'm sorry for calling so late but I had to talk to you. ﻿It's alright. What's going on? ﻿How's Nony doing? ﻿He may be alright but I'm going nuts. ﻿What do you mean? ﻿Listen, Shlomi... ﻿Come over and pick him up. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿You shouldn't be here. ﻿I came to apologize. ﻿So you brought me a dog? ﻿Robert? No, ﻿Robert? -I brought him here to marry us. ﻿To do what? ﻿We're meant to be together, and Robert's going to marry us. ﻿Right, Robert? ﻿Amnon, ﻿I have to ask you something. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Do you remember me? ﻿Nony? ﻿Nony? ﻿Nony? ﻿Nony... ﻿Nony! ﻿Amnon! ﻿Amnon! ﻿Amnon? ﻿Amnon! ﻿Nony? ﻿Good evening. ﻿Amnon's concert is canceled. We apologize. ﻿Refunds at the box office. ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! -What is this?! ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Amnon! Amnon! Amnon! ﻿Five weeks later ﻿He needed pills! And lots of them! ﻿Shlomi, please, this is not the way to handle the situation.. ﻿So what's the right way? No, seriously. I want to know. ﻿You have to give him time, okay? ﻿Had he wanted to come back, he would have already done so. ﻿Do you hear what you're saying? You're sick in the head! ﻿I'll see to it that you lose your license! ﻿You hear me? -We gave you our son. ﻿We put his life in your hands and you destroyed him. ﻿He ran away, okay? ﻿Running away from something is also running towards something... ﻿Enough! Enough already! ﻿Do you think he's still alive? ﻿What? ﻿What kind of question is that? ﻿Yes. I think he is. ﻿His parents are going crazy. ﻿Fuck everything! ﻿Are you bummed? ﻿Of course I'm bummed. Are you a nutcase? ﻿You're starting with the "nutcase" too? ﻿"Amnon is back! Final performance" ﻿Jesus! Unbelievable. ﻿He's nuts, man. ﻿You know this was the right way. ﻿You know it was the right thing to do. ﻿You took a chance. ﻿I told you you should report it. ﻿You did this to yourself. I'm sorry. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Yes, Rotem? ﻿I can still be saved ﻿I know it ﻿I can wake up ﻿Sober up ﻿I can still speak ﻿With love ﻿About myself and the city and a woman... I﻿'m less angry now ﻿And a quiet wave of feeling is breaking ﻿A mother sings a lullaby to her son ﻿Mother is always here with you ﻿I feel like something is changing ﻿The weariness will pass, the sun will rise ﻿Then I'll recognize you, my dear ﻿And you'll recognize me ﻿I was always afraid I'd go mad ﻿That my heart would freeze and empty out ﻿But now as I sit here ﻿I can still be saved ﻿I think... ﻿Thank you.
