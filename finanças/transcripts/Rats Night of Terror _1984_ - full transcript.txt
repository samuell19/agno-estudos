Get off your bikes, come on! Damn, I'm aching all over! Your legs are itchy, huh? Yeah, just like yours! I'm beat. Let's go. Video. Shame, lunch's gotten away. Here's where that little bastard came from. Look. There's a whole nest of them. It's chock-full of rats. We aren't going to starve now, right, Kurt? My mom was great at cooking them, you know. She stuffed them with roots. That way, they didn't taste too gamey. Stop thinking about it, Video. Maybe we'll find something better. Open it. It's food! This is sugar! It's sugar! What are we waiting for? Let's dig in! That's great chow, guys! So good! Hey, how do you open this? Beans! We got beans, guys! I saw this first! This is flour! It's flour! - It's flour! - Great! - Flour! - Hooray! Flour! - Dang it! - Come on, Chocolate! Look, I'm white! I'm white! She's white now! I'm whiter than you! Whiter than you! I'm white now! I'm white! We're in heaven, guys! I'm white! I'm white! Enough! Stop screaming! This is not the first time we've seen a dead body. He died horribly. Just look at his wounds. The people who came here before us killed each other over those supplies! But this man was still in his bed. How do you explain that? Whatever happened, it doesn't concern us. Enough talking. Let's get going. - To do what? - To make sure this place is safe. Hey, Video, your little friend is back. Let's see if he wants a beer! Sure, one beer coming up! Strike! These filthy things are everywhere. Take it easy, Taurus. Rats are just born unlucky, you know. Imagine being a rat and being hit with a broom by someone as big as you. It would be annoying, I guarantee you. Speaking of rats, there's another one. Where do you think you're going, you bastard? Hey, Duke! This rat doesn't believe in your theory! He acts like a tough guy and refuses to leave. You've got no finesse, Taurus. Strong with the weak and weak with the strong. Come on, little mouse, stop hiding and get out of there. Uncle Duke is ready to take care of you. He's not listening, huh? Very well, I'm gonna get you. Careful, those bastards bite. Oh, they won't bite me. He got me! Watch out! Get it off! Get off me, you little asshole! There's someone there. Relax, Chocolate. It was only a prank. Try it again and I'll blow your head off. You hear me? Look what I found, Kurt. What's the matter with this damn flashlight? - Damn, it's gone. - Shit! I shoul've stayed with Lucifer! You always screw things up! Always! Calm down. It's not my fault the flashlight stopped working. Stay close behind me and try not to panic. Be careful, there's a stairway here. Here. I wonder what this machine was used for. I'll tell you. To play with. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a videogame. It looks a little different than others, but that's what it is. Allow me to demonstrate. Let's see. I'll screw you if you can make it work. I don't think you've got what it takes. Come on, Video. I'll give you a consolation prize if you fail. You shouldn't have challenged me, Chocolate. I've already won. Stop bluffing, Video. There's no videogame that could resist me. Hey, I think I've got it. Got it! These plants are in perfect condition. And that looks like a water purifier. I can't believe it. It's wonderful. But why have plants stopped growing naturally? It's a long story, Lilith. It would be pointless to talk about it now. But I can tell you one thing. From now on... we'll never get thirsty again. What kind of a game is this? Either this thing is broken or it's impossible to win. This isn't a videogame. It's a computer. Damn it. I'll never be able to find a real videogame. Stupid know-it-all machine. Go to hell! What's happening? Maybe that kick caused a short circuit. The computer has gone mad. Unless... Video involuntarily asked it a question. Well, I don't like this. Computers and corpses don't mix. If I really asked this computer something... it's also the only one to know what the question is. Total elimination of the group. What does that mean? Perhaps... it refers to the bodies. The bodies we found. The answer was meant for them. We found something incredible downstairs, you have to see it! The ones who came here before us... had found a way to artificially recreate what once grew naturally on Earth. Look, there's everything. Fruit, vegetables, legumes. There's every kind of plant. And this is what they used to distill and purify rainwater. Come on, Diana, taste it. It's fresh. And so good. I've never tasted anything like this in all my life. It's incredible there's people who managed to create this. Yeah. They were perfectly organized, that's for sure... and yet they got themselves killed so easily. That's the last one. So many of them, huh? Everyone stand back. Requiescat in pace. What did you say? Only a few words. Once, they were used to bless the dead. - Are you ready, Chocolate? - Ready for what? The bet concerning the computer. You lost, remember? Oh, come on, I was only joking. That's not fair, Chocolate. You must always honour your bets, you know. A little advance payment for now. Good night, Video. Stop that. Stop that, you creeps! I'm talking to you! Stop making so much racket or just go outside if you want to fuck! You ruined the moment, you jerk. I was almost there. I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't stop I'll blow you both to hell. Stop that. Taurus is right. Go outside if you want to do it. Damn it. Okay, chief. An order's an order. This damn zipper is stuck. Damn it, Lucifer, you're hurting me! Shut up, can't you see it's stuck? What's the matter, Lucifer? Got your dick stuck in there? And now you're condemned to fuck for all eternity. Well, at least they say it's the best way of dying! Stop laughing at us and give us a hand. Hey, you were almost there. You sure you want us to stop you? Come on, let's get out of here before I kill somebody. We can't, Lucifer. We're stuck in here. The poor guys are stuck! Come on, Taurus, give them a hand. How did you do it? Patience is a virtue. Remember that, Lucifer. Rotten bastards. Stop thinking about them. Let's pick up where we left off. Those bastards. I don't feel like it now. Let me help you, then. How do you feel? Like a god. I feel so relaxed that... I would start over again. Don't be greedy, Lucifer. I'm tired. You're such an impetuous lover. I can't keep up with you. Damn it! You're making fun of me, too! I'm not making fun of you. I'm tired, I told you. I need to get some sleep. Don't be so mad. Why are you getting dressed? Where are you going? I need some air. And I want to be alone. Good bye. Can't keep up with me, sure. Hey, this stuff is incredible. No! Stop tainting our water with your shit, you filthy beasts! Get out! Out! This is our water! Out! Get out! Out, you damned beasts! Hey, what's this? A telephone? A telephone! You're supposed to be ringing. Ring! Ring! Hello? Dad, is that you? It's me. It's me, your son. What? You're dead? You're really dead? You guys are having a party, huh? Where's the party? Where is it? Where's the party? And you are the only guests. A bunch of fucking rats! I'm not coming with you! Fuck you all! Fuck you! Shit! I've lost my bottle. But you can't get away from me, baby. We'll be together forever. We're lovers and nothing can separate us. Come back to your boyfriend. Fuck! I almost fell down. Hey, little brother, are you here to invite me to the party? What about you? Wanna grab a drink? I'm not giving you my bottle! What the fuck! No! Get away from me! Help! It's stuck! Help! It's Lilith! Lucifer must have gone crazy! We've got to help her! Taurus! Lilith! Lucifer! Lilith! Lilith! Lucifer! I've found her. He's killed her. But Why? No wounds. He must have strangled her. We shouldn't have kicked them out. We should have stayed together. We have to find Lucifer. We must avenge her. He didn't kill her. We've been targeted by someone who wants to kill us all! I swear I'm gonna kill that filthy rat! Look. It's moving! Her mouth is moving! It can't be! She's dead! No! No! The rats killed her! And now they want to eat me! Myrna, calm down! Calm down! Rats don't eat people, pull yourself together. Kill me! Kill me, I beg you! Get after him! No! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Stop it, Myrna! Get a hold of yourself! Come out and face us, you bastards! Come out so I can kill you all! Come out and face us! I'll kill you! Smash you to bits! Come out! I'm going to kill you all! I'm going to tear your guts out! You bastards! You rotten bastards! Where's Lucifer? What happened to him? Back inside, quick! Lucifer? Taurus, Chocolate, come with me. Lucifer? Look. This is where they attacked Noah. Yeah. Let's get out of here. Those rats might come back. You're right. Let's go. There's somebody in here. It might be Lucifer. Stay frosty, guys. There's thousands of rats in here! Run! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Please, I don't want to die! Please! I don't want to die! We must find Lucifer. He couldn't have vanished! Help Myrna. Let's look outside. Kurt! Kurt! I found him. He's dead. - No! No! - Poor Lucifer. Look what they've done to him! He's been eaten alive! Lucifer... The rats have sabotaged our bikes! They chewed though the tires! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Look at that. They've got them all! You idiot! You were supposed to be guarding the bikes! Stop it, Kurt. And you remain calm. Nobody could have predicted it. If we start panicking, we're done for. Get out of my way! Okay, Taurus. I was wrong. How can we get out of here with our bikes gone? We're fucked! Well... It looks like we're all fucked, chief. What do you mean by that? That you should have put the bikes somewhere safe. You should have tried using your brain instead of wasting time with trivial stuff. Those bikes were our only way to get out of here and save our butts. We should have left as soon as we sensed the first sign of danger. Yeah, that worked real fine. No more mistakes from now on. We'll barricade ourselves in there. Tomorrow we'll decide our next move. Let's go! Sure, one of your other brilliant ideas. Those rats sabotaged our bikes because they want to kill us all... and if we go in there we'll be doing them a favour! We made a mistake, but we're smarter than them! Try to remember that! Noah, Lilith and Lucifer. They went off alone. That's why they're dead! Dead! We're gonna barricade ourselves in there, whether you like it or not. I'm not getting killed because of you. When a tribal chief makes a mistake, he's killed by his people... and his place is taken by someone who can protect the tribe. And I'm that someone. Who agrees with me? All right. I know what you want. - I accept your challenge. - What's the matter with you? You gone mad? Listen to me, Kurt, and you too, Duke. Thousands of rats are trying to kill us for who knows what reason. Yet, you're only thinking about killing each other over your stupid pride. Okay, Duke. Let's see if you got what it takes to be a leader. Okay, Kurt. You're the leader. Good. Now let's get to work, we've wasted enough time. We've got to barricade the doors and windows. Let's begin, come on! I don't feel safe. Hurry up with those planks. Here, take these. Myrna! Myrna, it was just a spider! Stop screaming! Stop it, for God's sake! You hear that? Maybe they're in danger. That was just Myrna, that nutcase. She's with our brave leader. Let's mind our own business. Anyway... I'm going to stand guard. Better safe than sorry. You keep working. Done. We should be safe now. There's no way those rats could be able to get in. Yeah, but I keep thinking about those people that were here before us... and how those rats have been able to kill them. And how they've been able to kill Noah, Lilith and Lucifer. I can't understand it. But why? What have we done to them? Why do they want to kill us? Maybe something reawakened their instinct to kill. Of course. Those who were here before us caused that. But we'll never be sure of what happened here. We shouldn't care about what happened here. There's something I can tell you: we'll make it out of here if we keep calm. We're going to make it. Many years ago, when I lived in the mountains with my family... our cave was attacked by a pack of hungry rats. They didn't attack us. But they devoured all the supplies we had. The rats we have here don't seem interested in food. Taurus's right. They haven't touched the flour or the cheese. They want to eat us. Stop talking nonsense, will you? We're superior, not them. Once it was like that. Perhaps. You've gone soft, too? You're right. Humans believed to be superior. They thought they could rule the world. And he always thought that rats were filthy beasts that should stay underground. In the sewers. In the sewers? You mean that, once, rats only lived in places like sewers? Before the world was destroyed... by the power of the atomic bombs... rats used to live underground, in the sewers. Beneath the great cities. I read that in a book. And what other crap was in that book? Something that I remember clearly. Their communities are exclusive. They don't accept anything or anyone. If an unknown rat wanders into their community... said rat is swiftly killed... before being devoured. And how can they tell the rat is different? Rats all look the same. That's not true. They don't look the same. They can tell the difference by how their urine smells. Rats knowing each other by smelling urine... You know what, I think that whoever wrote that book fooled you... despite having a brain the size of a rat's! You heard our holy man, guys? I guess we took too much piss in here, that's why the rats want to kill us! Well, even if the rats see us as enemies, this place is ours. And we're going to keep it! We're going to keep it! It's them! They're coming to get us! They'll kill us all! Kurt, that window! We forgot to barricade that window! - Help! They're biting me! - Diana! - Help! - Diana! - Damn it! - Diana! Too many rats! - Secure that damn window! - Diana! Let's get out of here! Quick! I'll kill you all! - Let's go! - I hate you all! Die! - Die! - Let's go! Lay her on the bed, hurry! - Here. - She's covered with bites! Taurus, get me some water. I need to wash her wounds before they get infected. - Hurry! - Ok! Fuck! We forgot the water! We'll have to do without it. How can we survive without water? We'll try to get out of here as soon as dawn comes. We can hold it. We can, but what about Diana? Her wounds are going to get infected. All right. Video, you stay here with the girls. We'll attempt to reach the greenhouse to get some water. Come on, let's go. I'm staying here, chief! I'm not risking my life for one of your dumb plans. Go get the water on your own. All right, Duke. You stay here with the girls. - Video will take your place. - Stop acting like fools! It was his idea to barricade ourselves in here. Let him solve this situation alone. That's nonsense. We're in this together and now we should think about saving Diana! Now listen, you son of a bitch. If you're looking to make me mad... you're brilliantly succeeding. I'm fucking mad! The coast looks clear, Kurt. Let's go. Myrna, come here. I'd like to have a word with you. Come on, old Duke's waiting. Don't be afraid. You can trust me. Kurt's wrong. But if you trust me... I will save you. Fill the can, Taurus. Damn it. - Kurt! - Hurry up! The tank is full of rats. The water's tainted! Let's go outside. We'll take some of our water. Kurt! The stairs are covered with rats. Shit! They're waiting for us. Good. They'll see who we are. We'll start by warming them up a little. What's wrong? This damn thing doesn't work anymore! Shit! Shit! Think of something, Kurt. They're trapping us! Taurus, give me your club! Filthy beasts! Taurus, be careful! Careful! There's so many! Too many! Kurt, hurry! There's more of them! Die, you beasts! Bastards! - Die! - We can't hold them anymore! Everyone behind me, quick! Single file, let's stick together! Die. Filthy things. Dirty bastards. - It's horrible. - There's so many of them. Die! Keep moving, guys. Come on! Quick! Hurry! Move, move. Watch out! - Taurus! - They're attacking me! Taurus! Taurus! Run! Save yourselves! - Save yourselves! - There's too many of them! - Dirty things! - Run! - Taurus! - Go! Go! - Run, save yourselves! - We can't leave him! Kilt. flamingo! - fanny! Kurt, hurry! Quick! Get to the door! Duke, open the door! Hurry! - Hurry up! - Open the door! - Come on, Duke! - Open it! - Open it! - Open the fucking door! What's going on in there? Duke, Chocolate, Myrna, open the door! They're about to overrun us, open the door! - Open it! - Duke! Chocolate! They're ready to attack! - Open it! - They'll kill us! What are you waiting for? Open that damn door and let them in! Open it, hurry! Open the door, asshole! That damn bastard must have gone mad. Tell me, chief, you got that water? It's tainted. Open the damn door! The rats are going to swarm us! You heard the chief? No water. We can't trust him anymore! You bastard! Open the door! Duke, stop being an asshole and open the door! Open it! Duke, you prick, open the door! Open it! Open it, damn you! The rats are coming, open it! They're coming at us. There's thousands of them. - No water and thousands of rats! - Duke, open the door! - Why should we risk getting killed? - Open the door! - I'm gonna kill you! - Open the door, you bastard! You'll pay for this, Duke! I'm going to kill you! - Open the damn door! - The rats are here, open it! Back! Get away! Don't stay there, it's too dangerous! I'll burn them to a crisp! I'll roast you alive! Get away! Back! Open that door! Open the door, for God's sake! Open it! - They're going to kill us! - Don't let us die, Duke! Your new leader has a preference for women. And you three will become my personal harem. - Open the door! - Duke, open it! Damn it! Our chief is in a bad position, I wonder if he'll make it out alive. Myrna, there's a rat there! You've stopped laughing now, you prick. One bad move and I'll put you down for good. Get away! Get away, you dirty things! Kurt! Hurry! Hurry up, the door's opening! Quick! Get inside! - You bastard! - No! Don't kill me, I only did it to protect the girls! I swear it, Kurt, it was the only reason! There's only a way to deal with a snake like you. - No, Kurt! You can't kill him! - Why not? You can't have mercy for this bastard. He promised he'd save me from the rats! He said that he'd protect me and that I won't end up like the others. You're even a bigger snake than I imagined. He promised me, Kurt. He promised he'd protect me. He promised me! Tell him! - Go on, tell him! - Yes, yes, I promised her. Please, don't kill him! Don't kill him, Kurt! My instinct is telling me I should waste you. Thank Myrna I'm not going to. Next time I won't show any mercy! I can't stand it anymore. We've got to do something about Taurus! Try to find him! It'd be impossible with all those rats. Keep your cool. Her temperature's really high. She'll die if it worsens. Only a few hours before dawn. We have to hold a little longer, then we'll leave this place forever. The rats won't let us. They won't let us get away that easily. What you people are lacking here is guts. We should stop moping and get out of here to face those things. They're taking advantage of our fear for them, don't you get it? That was a man's voice. Maybe it's Taurus. Yeah, I thought it sounded like him as well. In that case, we'll have to do the impossible to save him. Our chief wants us to become rat bait. One more word and you're dead, Duke. Back inside. They're smart, but I can't believe they've pretended to stop to lead us into a trap. Okay, that's it. I'll try to get across them, but I'll do that alone. Not alone. Either all or none. And I want to be the first. Let's go. Chocolate, we're leaving Diana. She'll be safe in here. We'll get her before we leave, if we manage to survive. Okay. I'll go first. No, I'll go first. I don't believe it, they haven't even tried to bite my shoes! Come on, guys! The war is over! Yahoo! Deus, it's your turn. Go with the girls. Get going, good luck. I'll watch your backs. Wait, I'll tell you when it's your turn. You better hope those things won't jump at you. Go. Okay, chief, now it's your turn to hope they won't jump at you. They'll kill us! I'm scared! Run! Get out of here! Go! - They'll kill us all! - Hurry! Come on, guys. We have to get through the main room. Wait! But, what... It's time to save ourselves. Taurus? - It looks like him. - Why don't you answer? Taurus? Can you hear me? Taurus! God! Look! That's Duke! He's fleeing! One more step and you're dead! Don't try to stop me, Kurt! I won't, but let Myrna go! Your days as a leader have come to an end! What's wrong with this thing? Fire, damn it! Fire! It's over, Duke! Get out of the vehicle and take Myrna with you. Be reasonable, Duke. You'd better be. If you care about her, drop your weapon and let us go! Let us go or I'll blow everything to hell! I think he's trying to bluff, Kurt. No. That snake would do it for real. We'll play his game for now. Okay, Duke, we'll put down our weapons! Leave Myrna and go! This is the only bargain you'll get! No way, chief! You're in no position to bargain! You've got two minutes to make up your mind, then I'll blow everything up! Drop your weapons, I'm not kidding! Little bastards! They're everywhere! Everywhere! I hate you! I'll slaughter you all! If I have to die, I'm gonna take you with me! Poor Myrna. She didn't deserve to die like that. They've been lucky, don't you get it? Our death we'll be much, much worse. Diana. Where's Diana? I don't know, she was right next to me. Damn it! Diana! We gotta find her! You look over there! Diana! Diana! Diana, where are you? Why don't you answer? Please, answer... Please, don't die. Don't leave me alone! Diana, I love you! Diana! I know what you want from me! You think of us as intruders. I know you hate me, I can feel it! Yes, I know it! I know what you want from us! Diana! I get it now. You are the new rulers. You are the new rulers of the world. Yes. Yes, we're the intruders, that's what we are. That's what we are. We are! We are! Diana, where are you? Diana! Diana! Diana! Are you here, Diana? Diana, where are you? Wait. No. Diana, no... No! No! No! - That's Kurt's gun! Let's go! - Quick! Kurt, you fired those shots? Diana. No! It shouldn't have ended like this. It shouldn't have ended like this. She slashed her wrists. Why did she do that? She chose suicide. She didn't make it, but you have to be strong! What's the point? They're stronger than we are. We can only wait until they get us. There's only four of us left. We can just try to defend ourselves. We tried everything to fight them. And what did it get us? Nothing. Nothing! They're stronger than us! Kurt, don't talk like that. We're here and we're still alive. And we have to keep fighting. You're our leader, you have to guide us! Wait! Go! Go! Open the door, Deus. Let's go. - Lilith! - Stop it, Chocolate! Pull yourself together! They put Lilith here to frighten us! It's like they wanted to send us a message of death. Cut your bullshit! We've got to get the body out of here. What the heck is this? Let me see. This thing might be like a magic lamp. Maybe it holds a magic solution that will get us out of this mess. This is an audio log about operation Return to Light, day 12. The time is 8:45 on the federal system. This is the experimental Station Delta 82. We're meeting Omega 3 in three days, they're coming to save us. But maybe this meeting will never take place. Unfortunately, Operation Return to Light has been a total failure. The measures taken by our scientists... to overcome the damage caused by pollution, radioactivity... and prolonged exposure to sun rays were correct. We could have never predicted what caused our mission to fail. Our failure was caused by an animal species we thought to be long extinct. Rats. The common rat that populated the city sewers before the war. Rats have proved to be a deadly, unstoppable enemy. Their intelligence is incredible. It all began when the radiation levels decreased... and we started to stop wearing our heavy protective clothing. That's when rats began to attack us. They killed us and fed on our flesh. They sensed us to be their greatest enemy. Never before an animal started to act like that. Perhaps they saw us as intruders who forced them to flee their natural habitat. Our new cities stand where they once lived. Or maybe they see us as... My opinion is... The others are all dead. The rats killed them. My time... My time is running out. Brothers, when you'll find this log... I'll be dead as the other members of this doomed station. Brothers, you must stay in your underground cities. Man is safe there. We'll never be able to live on the surface again. They rule the surface of our planet. Their communities won't ever allow intruders! They'd kill and eat them! They're coming! There's thousands of them! Thousands! It's over! It's all over! So, there are people like us living underground. It's incredible. They took the rats' place. That's why the rats attacked them. I don't understand. Why did they attack us, then? Because they think that the surface of our planet belongs to them. Therefore... They think we're invading their territory. But, if I remember correctly, that book you read said... that rats only see rats from other communities as enemies! What you said doesn't make sense, Deus. I think that men returned to the surface because... something terrible and unstoppable forced them to stop living underground. I think that horrible things are taking place under the Earth's surface. Horrible, dreadful things. The worst thing about this story is that we got caught in the middle. It was a matter between rats and people living underground! - They'll break the door down! - We're not going down easily. - That door won't hold out for long! - They're gonna get us! Video, take Chocolate and create a barricade back there! - Yes! - No! - Don't waste time! - No, no! - It's useless, Kurt! Make another barricade will just prolong our agony! That's enough! I'm your leader, so do as I say! - No! - Do it! We'll try to stop them! Kurt... Fuck! Fucking rats! Run! Run away from the door! - Hold it, Deus! - I can't! There's thousands of them behind this door! No! No! No! Kurt! No! No! - I got to help him! - Don't! Don't go, Video! Kurt! Kurt! No! Kurt! Kurt! Kurt! No! No! They'll kill us! No! Damn it! I don't want to die! Kill me, Video. I beg you. - Kill me, Video! - No! - Don't let them eat me alive! - No! - Kill me! I'm begging you! - No! Please! Do it if you care for me! Please, don't let them kill me! Please! Do it! Die, you fucker! They've gone! The rats have gone! They've gone! It's gas! It's making the air unbreathable! - We must get out of here, now! - No! The rats! Don't you understand it, Chocolate? Don't you understand why the rats have gone? Our rescuers are here! They've come to save us! - Who? Who's come? - The ones mentioned in the audio log! Our rescuers! The men from Station Delta 82! - The people who live underground! - Yes! - Come on, let's go meet them! - Yes! I can't do it anymore! Video, where are you? Where are you? You are the ones from the audio log. The people who live underground. Is that who you are? Thanks for saving us. Bless you. Thank you. Yes, thanks for saving us. You arrived just in time, friends. We're your friends. We're part of the same race. One of our companions read that, once, people of Earth called each other brothers. That book was called the Bible. It also said that a god created man and animals, and... Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
