It started with an arrest we'd made on apprehending persons who were hired to assassinate US. We'd been informed by an anonymous person that there were three men on fulton street and utica Avenue with sawed-off shotguns... And also supplied the description of the car and the license plate number, waiting for US, and they had been paid to kill US. Why do you think they wanted to kill you? We had made approximately 60 to 70 drug arrests in one concentrated area. We had put two or three of the biggest operators out of business. They had attempted to bribe US on occasions. We wouldn't go along with it. The only way to go back into business was to get rid of US. They have demonstrated imagination and efficiency and bravery and integrity in the four years since they became patrolmen. Of the 600 arrests, approximately 1/4 were for illegal possession of dangerous weapons...Guns. 2/3 of the arrests were for narcotics felony charges. Guns and narcotics are the instruments of death in our society. Let's go! When you reach your proper place, I want you to get organized according to height, from the tallest to the shortest. All you guys from the Bronx, line up down there, from queens over here. Then I want Brooklyn. Then let's have staten island, and let US have Manhattan. Come on! Let's go! Let's get organized! Tallest guys in the front row. Tall in front and short behind. Isn't that backwards? Lieutenant, I've been doing this for years. It's how we do it is all. Tallest guys in the front row. Guys over 6'1" in the front row. The rest fall in behind. All right. [Man] Attention. Repeat after me. "I do solemnly swear..." I do solemnly swear... "That I will support the constitution of the United States..." That I will support the constitution of the United States... "And the constitution of the state of New York..." And the constitution of the state of New York... "And that I will faithfully discharge the duties..." I will faithfully discharge the duties... [Man] "Of the office of patrolman..." [Together] Of the office of patrolman... "In the police department of the city of New York..." In the police department of the city of New York... "According to the best of my abilities." According to the best of my abilities. Scare the shit out of 'em! That's where you get the edge on people. Don't walk up to a guy and say, "drop your gun." Make him think you're crazy. Maybe you all are crazy. You're going to be fun-city cops. You'll come on the job at 8:00 in the morning. You want to be able to go home at 4 P.M. The way you came. There's only one way to do that. Imagine some joker comes up to you somewhere and goes, "karate!" Karate, my ass! The hell with that hand-to-hand shit. Hit him with a garbage can. Pick up something and blind him. Make him open a newsstand in the morning. You o.K.? You all right? All right, my ass! Want to open up a newsstand in the morning? Ah! Ooh! Hey, see? Somebody cares. Oh, jeez. Continuing on the sanitary code 19-5. The big points to remember are these. The garbage can shall be provided with a cover, which shall be in place. The garbage can shall be positioned not less than 12 feet from the curb of a facing street. Hey, Greenberg, wake up. What for? Because I tell you, damn it. Anybody got any questions? Ahem. Greenberg. I joined up to be a detective. How long will it require me to make that particular grade? Next question. Greenberg. We've been issued guns. When are we going to learn how to use them? You have guns and shields. Technically, you are police officers, but until you graduate from here, don't look for trouble. French films? What? You want to buy French films? I don't know. I have three films... Very French. They're worth $100 apiece. I'll give all three to you for $50. Ain't that against the law? Please, I need money. $50. Do me a favor. Just leave me alone. $30. Look! I'm a police officer! Bug off! What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Get out of here with that. Come here. You lunatic! Move. Move! Are you out of your mind? Morons. I collar a creep for attacking a cop, and it's me that's in trouble. "What were you doing in the area? Where was your gun?" They haven't taught US to use a gun yet. Hey, that your car over there? Yes, sir. Present to me from Joey banana. Why ain't you in uniform? We figured that wearing those gray monkey suits would just make US moving targets. The regulation is you men will wear uniforms and employ public transport going and coming from this academy. Go back and get into uniforms, where stupid slobs like you belong. Uh, sir? Oh, man. Offhand I see about eight dozen violations. [Gunshots] Come on back here. That ain't our business. What if they need help? You are a nut. If they want help, they'll call for help. Sir... Stay on your post, do as your told, and don't stick your snotty nose in where it don't belong! There's a sniper back there! Aah! What's happening? There's a sniper up there. Sniper. Cover me. Come on! [Gunshot] O.k. Get back on traffic. That's all. That's all? You ain't said nothing. I wanted to see you. I have now seen you. Look on the bright side. We're blowing tin whistles 12 hours a day. This department's stupid, but it ain't crazy. We make a good drug collar, what the hell can they do to US, huh? Bust our tails! We got to be a team, man. I'm serious. You got to trust me. Got you. You want to be my partner? I haven't had many other offers. Oh! What's the plan? We'll make an arrest on our own, huh? Let's hit my old neighborhood. Where's that? Coney island. I feel funny dressed like this. [Greenberg] You want to come to this neighborhood dressed like a cop? Pretend it's Halloween. We're nuts. What I don't know about the drug scene would fill a whole library. Don't worry about a thing. I'll take the lead. That's what worries me. [Greenberg] I think I know this cat. Come on. Is that angel? You look like angel. Angel? Hey, como esta, baby? How are you? O.k. You don't remember me for nothing. Dave Greenberg, man. I was brought up a couple of bl... We were thrown out of the same high school. You remember, man? We put rocks in snowballs. That's my buddy over there. He's Bobby hantz. You remember me, man? You know what I'm doing now? I'm a mechanic on fulton street. How you doing, man? O.k. You think you could score some stuff for US, man? You want to score, man? You know what I'm talking about. Do it for high-school days. Come on. Just wait here a second, o.K.? We get made as cops, we're dead. We ain't going to get made as nothing. We got guns, don't we? You got yours ready? Just cool it until you see some stuff. Maybe one of them's got a gun. Try to act cool, will you? Oh, god. Oh. [Whistling] Hey, baby, what's happening? O.k. How much you want? We're in pretty heavy, man. How much you asking? Five...a bag. Three. Five. Three! What's the problem, man? I got the stuff on me. Come on, angel. Hey, hey! What is this jive, man? We asked you a favor, and you don't want to do it. What's the matter with your friend? Huh? You think you're the only dude in the world dealing? He's putting you on. He's putting you on. You got 10 bags, we got 50 bucks. [Whistling] O.k., o.K., o.K. I got 10 bags for you. Cool it, man. I'm a little dry, baby. I'm sorry. Let's see them. All right, man! Hit the ground! Everybody down! Now! Down! I said down! Off-duty. You're probationary patrolmen, and you busted this guy in coney island for this stuff... Uh, narcotics? That's right. Then you also took a bunch of these concealed weapons? Right. Why? Where do you guys work out of? 47th street Manhattan s.U.B. S.u.b.... Safety unit "b." Safety unit? You mean you direct traffic? That's correct. Off-duty from a safety precinct dressed up in costumes, and you... I give up. Go upstairs and tell it to the detectives. Yes, sir. Let me give you the picture, o.K.? You and your friend got your guns and your shields from the academy. You're looking to make extra cash. You go to a hot spot, you find some guy selling junk. "Listen," you tell him. "We're cops. "All you got to do is give US bread... Say, 50 bucks." But they don't got that, and now you're drawing a crowd. So you couldn't shake them down, and you had to lock them up. That's the picture, isn't it? Very smart. Crooks. Trying to shake US down... Flake US with that stuff. I know. They all say that. What other picture could there be? Why else would you have busted them? Take your prisoners to the Brooklyn criminal court. With luck, you'll be through with the arraignment by Christmas. Number 27, you're in heaven. Ready for your prisoners in part four. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey, hey! What happened to this? What the hell is this? We got our paperwork done at 5 A.M. We went home, got our uniforms. We drove back. We've been waiting here for six hours, and they skipped our number? Hmm. 10 bucks could rectify that error. All right. We tried it that way. Let's try it honest. What do you say? I think we ought to play it to a bust. Blue imperial... Stolen. How sure are you? Only 110%. That's good enough for me. Get over! Get over! [Car horn honks] May I please see your license and registration? Don't you know who I am? No, sir, I do not. License and registration, please. Freeze! Open it...Slow. Off-duty, and you spot this car, which is not listed stolen, and so you... I don't get it entirely. What precinct are you from? S.u.b. Which? Sergeant, it's stolen, all right. It just came over the wire. We got some pretty hot s.U.B. Matters to attend to. Can we just cut the garbage and get on with the paperwork? These men are from the s.U.B. Expedite them. S.u.b.... Part of the commissioner's office, isn't it? [Telephone rings] Finley, Manhattan criminal. Grubnick here, s.U.B. Listen, Finley, I'm sending two of my new men over for an arraignment... Greenberg and hantz. Put through their case a.S.A.P. As soon as possible. Where do they find you guys? Yes, sir. A.S.A.P. What did you say your name was again? Thanks a lot, Finley. I appreciate it. If you guys ain't too busy, could you get US some coffee? We could use a spare cigar, too. Thanks a lot. [Greenberg] Well, not bad, huh? Saved US 15 hours, 22 minutes from the last arraignment. Never been the system that couldn't be beat. We should go to a bar, find some chicks. My thinking is that we find chicks living near every courthouse. Wouldn't that save US time going back and forth to Brooklyn? Oh, man! Let's see. Excuse me, officer. Would you take care of this? Hello there. The captain is anxious to see you guys. We figured he might be. Watch out for one thing. When he pins on the medals, make sure he doesn't kiss you on the cheek. [Greenberg] Sir, hantz and me... We made all kinds of collars on our own time. All we got so far is called crooks and treated like we got leprosy. A polite question is, what in the hell kind of police force is this? It is a big organization. That's what kind. Like general motors, like the army, it has its own system of doing things. It may be lunatic. Who knows? Who cares? But if you are bucking that system, you are in trouble! Even if we aim to improve it? Mmm, boy. You belong in the New York police department like I can walk on water. Get back on traffic. That's all. I've had it with you guys. Probation's over, and have I got a garden spot for you. Yes, sir. [Greenberg] What a place to have to live. [Hantz] Ain't going to be no picnic working here. No wonder them cats laughed when we got this assignment. Somebody at center street really digs US, huh? Yeah. At least we're in the same precinct. Wow. People have to live like this. No wonder the crime rate's so high. Our new home. Hey, hey! The old 2-1! [Telephone rings] How are you doing? Uh, Greenberg and hantz. [Officer] Yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir. How you doing? Greenberg and hantz. Reporting for duty, sir. Rookies, huh? O.k. You got today and tomorrow off. Off? We just got here. What are you...Deaf? Go downstairs and see if you can find yourselves a locker. There ain't any lockers, but look anyway. [Telephone rings] 2-1 precinct, lieutenant o'shaughnessy. Will you stop bothering US with that? Who cares? Thank you very much. Appreciate it, sir. Hey, how you doing there, guys? Greenberg and hantz. How are you? [Man] Oh, my god. Fresh out of probation. Why do they send US these guys anyway? That's all we need around here... A couple guys selling bonds for Israel. Hey. I don't know how you guys screwed up to get sent here. Get on with the guys and make no waves, and you'll be fine. Ok? Excuse me, sir. Can we talk to you a minute, please? [Door closes] Uh, speak to me? Yeah. Greenberg and hantz. So? You must have heard of US, sir. We request assignment as a team. Wait a minute. Hold it. Pull the shade. The shade! The shade! [Turns radio on] As far as i'm concerned, this whole station house is bugged. I know the phones are tapped. Excuse me. Did you say it's bugged? Bugged. Bugged. The phone... Tapped, tapped. By who? Who? God knows. Internal affairs, drug dealers, pimps. Maybe the whole lot. You want to be assigned together, huh? Please. Why? Because of our record... Over 40 felony arrests, many of them narcotics. Stop, please. Enough. You're in bed-stuy now. Rats eat the people. The people eat heroin. There isn't a damn thing you can do about it. Around here, I wouldn't team two rookies together. Sir, we're not your regular... [Turns radio off] Out the door. This talk is over. Two days off? That's cool. These cats don't know what we do on our own time. That is beautiful. Come on. [Car horn honks] Ahh... Ain't that something? Uh, excuse me. You live around here? Where are you going? Where are you going? I got to check this lead out. Come on. Come on. Come on. [Baby crying] [Hantz] Are you crazy? There are four pimps down there. So what? We're together, right? Hey, baby. Hey, you. Come on. Come here. Come on. Now come on, sweetheart. I know you're not shy. Are you Jewish? No, but I have a Jewish client. I'm hip. You sure are gorgeous. I'm a police officer. I swear to god I ain't going to pull you in. All I want is a favor, please. Could you tell me of any junk pushers in the area? Aah! Come on, babe! Move! [Woman screaming] What the hell is going on in there? Bad news, man. She's in labor. She's having a baby. Run up and help her. Come on. She shouldn't have screamed like that. Who the hell does she think she is, screaming like that? I got to go back there. What? Come on, man. I got to go. Hey, man. You tell that psycho chick of yours not to scream like that again. Hey, oh... Don't you do that again. I don't like people who can't control theirself. Oh? I ought to run you in for a noise violation. Aah! I ain't sure about this thing. Come on, man. I've been told everything. Name's Earl Damon, and he deals out of apartment 4c. So why did you need me? Set the box is all. Huh? Come on. You want to be one of my registered informants or no? Say I am. I mean, uh... Do you supply me? Come on, man. I'm a cop. Cops can't supply addicts. Just suggest me some funny place Earl might hide the junk in his apartment, man. Come on. He's got it all over, man. Even got bags stashed up the chimney. Oh, yeah? That's wild. Dig those detectives, man, crawling up the chimney to get the junk. Come on. Come on. Come on, baby. You do it? I dig you, man. You know? Cool. The box is set. Beautiful. Ooh. How legal is this? Legal? Offhand, I'd rate it somewhere between murder and kissing a cocker spaniel. Get out of here with that stuff. [Knocks on door] Hey, man, I've got a bundle on me. Can I get some heavy stuff? We're cutting it now. You wait, o.K.? [Men] * it's the Pepsi generation, coming at you... * hey, Earl! Come here! * get yourself behind a Pepsi * * when you get there, you belong * * you've got a lot to live * * and Pepsi's got a lot to give ** hands up! Hands back! [Indistinct yelling] All right. Up, up, up, up, up! Get your hands up! Up, up! Up, up, up, up, up. Don't move a hand. All right, just don't move. You o.K.? Yeah. Don't move, I said. [Siren] Oh, man. [Woman] What's going on in there? It's all right. Frisk them. Frisk them! Want to help US, gentlemen? Frisk these men. That haven't been frisked yet. Unbelievable. We've been trying to get this guy for... Hey! Who are you? Greenberg and hantz. Where do you work from? 2-1 precinct. That's our precinct. How come I never see you guys? When did you start working here? Uh, the fact is, we started working here tomorrow. [Siren] Captain? [Man] Move it along! Come on! [Second man] Hey, what's wrong with you? Keep your cool, man! All right, all right. Don't be pushing me! What's the matter with you? What's wrong with you? I've got four for narcotics. O.k. Take them out. What's wrong with you, man? Greenberg! Hantz! Come here. If you're wrong, I'll hang you. Hey, cap. Enough. We got a couple of real cuties. Yeah. Two hot dogs, I'd say. Couple of guys who will teach US lessons and break our backs. Come on, will you? Ha ha ha! Holding half a key of heroin. Question is, what did they do with the other half before we arrived? If it was up to me, I'd call internal affairs. But in the meantime, I'd lock them up. Hey, man. How did you pay the junkie who set up the cardboard box with money or junk? An officer's informants is his business and his risk. You ought to know that, huh? The hot dogs are giving US a lesson. What the hell is this? We're human beings, hantz. We don't enjoy being made to look bad. Now, what did you guys do with that heroin you stole? I sold it to your mother, moron. Uh uh uh uh. [Whistles] Excuse me. Mm-hmm. No good. What's wrong with them? Written up wrong. Go back upstairs and start all over again, o.K.? Let me see these. These papers look o.K. To me. Put 'em through, Sean. Uh, captain krasna, sir? Can I talk to you a minute? He's your boss, boys. He gives you all the assignments. Get to be good friends. Come here. 21st, 21st. Just a second, just a second. Wait! Aah! Aah! Why are you allowing them to do that to these children? They sell dope around here like candy. It wasn't like this 20 years ago, black kids around here didn't know what dope meant. Why are you talking to them? They work for them Hayes brothers. That's right. Who are the Hayes brothers? Three dudes who own the candy store over on utica Avenue. Reputed to be the main dope suppliers in this district. Reputed? That's right. Reputed. Holy Moses! Whoever put you on this typewriter must be working for the mafia. Or the Hayes brothers. Greenberg, let me know when you're through with those, will you? I got 10 more. [Greenberg] Thank you, sir. What do you know about the hayeses? No more than you. They supply 85% of the junk pushers in this precinct and have been doing so for some time. Meaning what, son? You believe they're getting protection? An outsider would think so. But knowing the two I do, I just say it's them two guys upstairs don't give a darn. My detectives have busted that candy store many times. Nobody's ever nailed the hayeses with a thing. They ain't so dumb as to keep the stuff arou... Do you mind if I suggest something to you, please? You want to slam their pushers with every man we got until they're bleeding at the pockets. Then that'll smoke the hayeses into a move. Nu? Forget about that! You want US to go by the book? Enough. [Blows whistle] Move it! Right here! Hold it! Uh, ma'am, I believe you didn't signal a turn. License and registration, please. [Blows whistle] Hey! How you doing? Nice car like this ought to have a muffler. Stop everything and get on those summonses. Captain, wait! Get the hell out of here. Captain! Listen. I had them on station security... You know, walking up and down the block. What could they do? Every time some jerk came along whose license wasn't in order, they didn't just give him a summons, captain. They impounded the car! Captain, wait a minute, will you? What could I do? The cards went by the book! You mean I got to take a whole shift off radio cars to drag those 17 vehicles to the pound? [Men humming] [Hantz laughs] Hmm-mmm. I know. You went by the book. Hmm! But more important... Hmm? I looked at your time sheets yesterday. How did you make those arraignments so fast? We developed some methods. Yeah. We're different, captain. You just assign US as a team, and we'll show you. The captain must like it in the 2-1, huh? Ah...how could he? If he didn't like it, he'd put US together, we'd roll up a score, and that would go to his credit, too, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it? [Humming] Doing anything tonight, baby? What do you say? I'm not 100% convinced this is a smart hangout for two white cops. It's our turf, Bobby. We going to be any use around here, we got to get to know it inside and out. My worry is our ending 6 feet under it. Patty and Liza are waiting for US at Liza's place. You take care of that. I'm staying here. Watch your step. Excuse me. Thinking about it, I don't blame you for screaming like that. I see where flashing my tin could put you in all kinds of trouble. Sorry. Look, if i'm bothering you, just say. I'll leave. Oh, wow. You're kidding me. Woo! Come on. That's tobacco. Even if it wasn't, I never made a pot bust in my life. You can believe that. You're making the people nervous, man. What you want, 50 bucks to clear out? I'm a pig, man, but my snoot ain't in the trough. Don't kid me. A policeman who ain't on the take? If I was, I'd be collecting for the six dudes in here with concealed weapons, one of who is you. I'm Dave Greenberg. And what do you want from me, Dave Greenberg? I don't know. I swear I got no idea. I know I got a hell of a lot to learn. I'm trying. You know, I...I'm trying to learn about...drugs and slums. I want to... I want to be educated. There are no shortcuts, Dave Greenberg. Well, here it is. This is where I live. You want to see how I used to make a living? Why not? What you doing here, man? Cool it. You get lots of respect there, Sara course I got a bad brother up in attica. They know he'll be back. [Music playing] God, but I used to make good money doing this. The village, Baltimore... Whew! God. But you know, nobody cares for good strippers anymore. Yeah. With what you can see in a movie, why should they? There is other jobs besides hooking, you know? With my schoolbook education, oh, sure, I could be a maid at the Plaza hotel. You know what I mean? But just between you and me, Charlie, shaking out whitey's sheets ain't quite my style. You know what I mean? [Music stops] Well, that was real dumb. You quit me just before the snappy part. Well, you know, I ain't the kind of cat who'd get you all undressed on false pretenses. Hey, look, Sara? Here we go again. Yeah, you're right. It's the same old song, but I'm serious. Bobby and me aims to hit the pushers around here like they never been, and aside from really digging you, I could use a tip now and then. No way. Why? I ain't helping you collar no brothers. We're talking about men who push heroin on black children. If you ain't part of the solution, then you're part of the problem. I got sixes, baby. Dynamite. Man, you trying to rip me off? I want fours. The brothers are having problems, baby. What was fours now are sixes. How many can you handle? I don't know. Let me see a sample. [Gagging] Victor, man, where you going? [Coughing] Come on, baby. Come on! [Coughing] Give me internal affairs. Toss your books on my desk. What? Toss your books on my desk. Internal affairs? I got two rookies here named Greenberg and hantz. Oh, you heard those names already, huh? Well, that's good, because what they were doing is all these off-duty narcotics collars. You know what that adds up to? Course they are. They got to be. Would you come and pick up their memo books? I thank you, inspector. I just gave you to the iad boys, the shooflies. Wouldn't matter now if you're on the level. The iad never gives up. They will frame you if they have to. My advice is, turn in your shields right now. Turn them in. They might lay off. You heard of the knapp commission? Well, it's an outfit being set up by our noble mayor to find corruption in the NYPD. Nobody likes that much, even internal affairs, so if you resign real quick and quiet, they might lay off. You're dead here anyway, so why not? Read him my mind, Bobby. You want our shields, your first step is to arrest US. Hold it! Hold it. That call to the shooflies was a fake, see? I saw it on television once. Just testing your reactions... And you passed. From now on, Irv krasna is in your corner. Oy, irvie, where have you been? Losing my mind is where, little by little. Probably it's gone entirely because I'm putting my neck with yours. That's something I haven't done in a very, very long time. What's that? Trusting a cop. In that case, sir, let me tell you a couple of things about how we operate. Are you out of your mind? I don't want to know anything. Just keep doing it. Get out there and fight, men. Nail them. Roll up a score. Do it for me, men. Get me out of this meshuggeneh precinct. Uh! Uh! Are you o.K., baby? Come on. What you seeing, man? Just a couple of cops. Ain't them new ones, is it? No. Just friendly neighborhood apple robbers. What were you saying, my man? You want me to tell brother Hayes you can't push 50 bags? No. Ain't saying nothing like that. All right. Who's next? Let me see those hands! Come on! Drop them! What's the matter? They broke? Get them up! Move! All right. Let's go. Come on! Don't put your hands on me, man. Bobby, you got this guy here? All right, come on. Right here! Stop right here! Right there. Keep your hands in the air! You got this guy here? Hold them, Bobby. Hold them. Hold them there, Bobby. Hold them, Bobby. Now, let's move. Come on! Slowly, slowly. Slowly we go. I may have to put the foot on you. [Man] You put your foot on me, man. Keep them high. Keep them high. Come on! Come on! Bobby, get them up against the wall. [Bobby] Come on! Onto the wall! Come on! Onto the wall! All right, gentlemen. What's the problem? We're not letting you take the brothers nowhere, man. [Man] Right on. Take that! I don't know who they think they are. Back up. Come here. Get over here! You've got five seconds to give the people good advice. Move, or else the stuff starts flying. Cool it down now, brothers. I got everything under control. All right. Cool it. All right. Cool it. All right, Bobby. Move them down. Come on, come on, come on. All right. Easy, easy, easy. Here we go. Come on! Move it! Let's go! [Man] Hey, man, why don't you come off it... Pushing our people? Hey, man! What is... Oh, look here. One of these... All these weapons? Just the two of you? Is that what you want US to believe? These babies come from dirty toilet seats, pal. We don't mind. Hey, will you fellows help US tag some of this evidence here? I got some vital garbage-can reports to type. Hantz got to get back to the missing dog case. Hey. Ever eat at a joint at utica and fulton? What? Do you ever eat at that java joint? Yes. Every morning. I don't understand. It is said that tomorrow morning, there's going to be a show there. You see this green Plymouth car parked outside there? Well, three torpedoes, Lily-white, imported from Detroit, are going to be in that car, and they have shotguns, see, and they're going to go boom, boom, boom. And what you're telling me is there's a contract? What I'm telling you is to get out of my life. That's what I'm telling you. Funny call just came in. Said if you two guys were having coffee in the morning, watch out for green plymouths. Green plymouths? Does that make sense to you? It was some nut, obviously. Listen, I hate your guts, both of you. As far as I'm concerned, you're a couple of nuts. What are you laughing at? But you're our nuts, and if I thought anyone was going to attack a police officer, I'd want to do something about it. Lieutenant o'shaughnessy, the famous nut protector. All right. He'll turn loose all those flatfoots, and they're going to shoot down 112 women and children in their excitement. Isn't that terrific? Ahem. Hold it, hold it, hold it. [Man] Hey, man! It's a green Plymouth on the right. I'll let you know. All right! [Car horn honks] [Greenberg] Drop it! Get out of the car! Go get 'em, Batman! Go get 'em, Robin! Hey! Hey, Batman and Robin! What were you going to do with this, huh? We're cop-hunting, man! We're cop-hunting. We're gunning for Batman and Robin. Who? Batman and Robin, that's who. You talking about US, man! Bull... Bull... all over you. You ain't yet advised US of our rights so we ain't said a word that counts. Greenberg and hantz? [Hantz] Yeah, right here. Hello. I'm judge kellner. Excuse me? Judge Benny kellner. I represent the defendants. Could we go out and talk a minute before the case is called? I'm a little confused, your honor. I never heard of a judge representing defendants. I'm not a judge now, but I was, and the title goes lifelong. What can we do for you, judge? I'll tell you frankly. My interest is to see this case dismissed. For testifying in a certain way, the consideration to you would be $1,500. You know why we arrested those guys? Possession of sawed-off shotguns. With which they had been paid to kill US. Are they charged with that? Sorry to say, no, because we forgot to inform them of their rights before they made said admission, and now, of course, they deny it. Well, then, I don't really see any problem. Who would pay for this consideration? You're looking at him. On behalf of who, judge? Could it be the Hayes boys? Answering that could, of course, be unethical. Look, why don't you let Bobby and me take a little walk, discuss this? You know what I mean? I appreciate it. Go right ahead. $1,500 cash. I'll wait for you outside the courtroom. Do you guys really know what you're doing? Making waves never helped anyone get ahead. Ow! Man, easy, will you, with the wire there? He's got it strung down there around my future, Jack. Hello, Fred. Now, I want four guys in plain clothes outside that courtroom. I want this payoff observed and no goofing up. Mr. Gold is interested in this personally, you understand? Benny kellner isn't such a bad guy, really. You know, I grew up with him. No, I didn't know that. God knows he was dumb to try and bribe you, but it would really hurt me to see him get jammed up this way, you know. I'll get back to you when the cops are wired. [Telephone hangs up] Maybe you didn't understand correctly. Well, I got to run back to my office. I'll see you later. Sir, don't let this man out of here. I beg your pardon? You let him out of here, kellner will know everything. I agree with him. What do you mean, insinuating something like that? I'm a district attorney! I brought you here! If kellner did this, he should go to jail, but I know he didn't. Then you stay in this office until I prove kellner is innocent, all right? You're off base, Greenberg. Mr. Thatcher's completely trustworthy. I'm surprised at you. You want me to stay, George? No. You can go, Harold. Of course you can go. [Door closes] All right, kellner, we got a deal. A deal? Are you addressing me? Yeah. Forget about the 1,500? 1,500? Money. What money? Are you crazy? Who are you? I don't even know you! What are you bums doing, offering me a bribe? Officers Greenberg and hantz! Right. Get inside immediately. This case was scheduled for 10:30. Where were you? Your honor, forgive US, please. We were at the district attorney's office... I know nothing about that...Nothing. You were due in this court, and you absented yourself without my consent. I move this case be dismissed for lack of prosecution and disrespect of the two police officers who have left this courtroom in such a manner. Case dismissed. Sir... Uh...ow! God! Aah! Come on, walk! Come on. Relax. Cool it. Cool it, girl! Hey, man, maybe she still has a concealed weapon on her. Come on, woman. Stand still, will ya? Come on, girl. Relax, hey! [Policeman] 1,500...what I hear you got for blowing the case. Is that what you hear? Maybe we got these creeps wrong. They ain't crooks. They're a couple of shooflies. Quit it! [Spits] [Fighting] Hyah! Hey, that's Batman and Robin! Come on! Hey, man! Hey! What's happening? Which one is Robin, man? He's Robin! This guy here is Robin! Hey, Robin, how's rope tricks been doing lately? Rope tricks? Your rope tricks, man! O.k., man? Good. Why aren't you kids in school, huh? Ain't got no school, man! No school today, man! How come there's no school? Holiday. Oh, no, no, no. Where's your mother? Oh, she's home sleeping. This isn't a holiday. This is Tuesday. All right. Go to school, huh? [Boy] Catch you later, Batman! Bye-bye, friends. I don't care. I'm not going to school. No way! Ha ha! How come you're Batman? I'm older than you, right? Come on! Robin's younger, right? Have you ever noticed that? Huh? Yeah. I never thought of that. Ahh... Oh, boy. It might be worth going on, then. Yeah. Things are so bad. Oh! They got to get better, huh? [Dispatcher] 21-Edward, a 1032 purse snatch... 765 St. Mark's Avenue. [Starts engine] Perpetrator on scene. Let's get him, Bobby. O.k., hold it. Hold it right there. You all right, man? Yeah. Check him. [Child shouting] Oh, man. Cat's a lieutenant, New York police. Ah... [Rock music playing] [Greenberg] Irving. Classy joint. Great, huh? She's got a ph.D. Can I take your order, boys? Scotch and water. Bourbon and water, please. How's it going? Oh, wonderful... Except for our lieutenant troubles. [Greenberg] The one we beat up. Oh, what the hell. So he won't ever propose marriage to you. He's not pressing charges, so what do you care? Forget about it. Ooh...ah. [Cheering] All right, you've been had by your d.A. You guys are just too good to give up now. Don't give that satisfaction to inspector novick. Novick... He's a shoofly with internal affairs. Asked if I'd ever seen you guys out of proper uniform. You're kidding. There's a guy from iad investigating two beat cops for being out of uniform? Think o'shaughnessy sent for him. Mm-hmm. I know he's been filing reports that you were seen wearing sneakers. You're kidding! Crazy, huh? Let's face it. You are not well-liked. There are some fellas downtown whose whole ambition seems to be nailing you to the trailer door. All right, look. They want these? They got them. They can have them. Oh, I wouldn't blame you. Thought about it often myself. There's one thing to consider. We're getting a new commissioner soon. So what? There will be a lot of changes in our department. When the commissioner sees your records... I swear, I will take them to him myself... I'll bet you he gives holy hell to all those jerks that have been holding you up, especially if it says on those records that you nailed those damned Hayes brothers. Now, you get them, I see no way they can deny your promotion. Mine, neither. I ride your shirttails. We'll get the Hayes brothers. Police officer! Open up! Next time, don't forget to close the window. Hey, like, don't you want your hat, man? Do you, uh, fellows have a warrant? [Greenberg] Not exactly. Oh, ho ho ho! Call the lawyer, John. Get judge kellner immediately. [Hantz] I knocked. I identified myself and asked permission to enter, your honor, and hearing a male voice inviting me to do so, I whereupon did. Ha ha ha! Cute. I like your style. Now, what do you fellas really want? Bobby. [Greenberg] In about a minute, I'm going to start searching, frank. You dig? Oh, man. Now, if this ain't the flaking to end all flaking. I wouldn't do that if I was you. Me, neither, frank! You are it. You hired shotguns to kill US. You fixed US in court. We're going to get you, I swear. Cover him, Bobby. Oh, man. Cut out that heat. Now, listen, you guys have hurt our operation enough already, and that don't do none of US no good. Now, what do you say to, um... 500 a week? Knowing our feeling about him, the man still wants to put US on the pad. Well, hell, I figure you guys got your thing to do, and we got ours. Mm-hmm. Live and let live... That's what I always say. $500 a week. Uh, how much you guys doing now? [Joe] Used to run, like, 15 grand a week. Used to... Till you guys started tapping US. All yours? I sure wish it was, man, but you see, we, uh, work for the Cuban. Who's the Cuban, man? A man from Cuba... Man. Real big, you know? 500's too low. [Greenberg] Bobby's right. That price will be $1,000 a week. Ooh-wee, baby. Now, that is stiff! Now, we going to have to get a whole lot of service for that. All right. When's your next pickup from the Cuban, man? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Cigar, baby. "Cigar, baby." Say it was, uh... Tonight. I'd ride along with you, frank, flash my tin in case you get hit for speeding or whatever, and if it was tonight, I'd be waiting for you at buffalo and park 8:00. O.k. You ride with US tonight, o.k., baby? In the meantime, however... There's some, uh... Caucasian lads trying to chisel in. Now, we understand that there's a pair of them coming this way to make a pickup. I can tip you on where to pick them up. We hit them, huh? Just tail them, that's all. See who they connect with. What do you think? Got kind of a busy day planned for US. That's got to be them, huh? Hey. You o.K.? Come on. Let's go. Hold it, fellas! Captain lackla, iad. Why are you out of uniform? I checked with your precinct. You're supposed to be on duty, correct? We don't have time for this. You can tell that to the chief inspector. We got the d.A.'S permission! Get in the car immediately! I got to be dreaming this! Patrolman Greenberg, for the last time, I don't care who you're tailing! Greenberg, what the heck are you doing? Greenberg, what is this? Greenberg, what's going on here? Listen to me, I'll get you for this, Greenberg! We're being tailed. I got a hunch this operation ain't going too good. Aah! Watch the buggy! [Gunshot] [Gunshots] What? Aah! Oh! You all right? Yeah! Come on! You all right? Yeah! Come on! Come on? I'm coming! Hey! Dave! Buffalo and park. Yeah. The Hayes boys will be picking me up any minute. Listen, Heller, sure we're covered? Absolutely, and don't be surprised if a neighborhood drunk walks up to you. We'll be with you every inch, Greenberg. Follow this through all the way. Any questions? Everything's a-o.K. I wish I was coming with you. Man, I'd feel a lot better with you behind me, Bobby, I'm telling you... Checking their cover, you dig? Oh... Heller said watch for a drunk. Believe him? Wait a minute... This cat here. You check him when I split, all right? No. Here they come. Thanks, man. Let's split. Hey, who's following them? Where's the rest of your team? Oh, no. So who they connect with? We lost them. Oh, man, I bought smarter cops than you in dime stores. I'm glad you think so... 'Cause we are in on everything with you, baby, but I swear to god, if I find out that you're screwing US just once, I'm going to take you and this whole miserable operation and hang you on it, you dig? [Tires squealing] So tell me about the Cuban, man. He's a man from Cuba, man. Period. John, make a right. What do you mean? We're meant to... Make a right, John... Down to the waterfront. Is something wrong, man? Nothing serious, man. Don't let it bother you. Pull right over here and stop. All right, man, what the hell is going on? You'll see in a minute, man. Just focus your eyes right out there on the water. Just cut the garbage. What is going on? You got a tape recorder! The pig is wired! Put your hands up. Put your hands up! Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him. Are you crazy, man? Let me choke him to death! [Coughing] You all right? I'm all right. Are you all right? Yeah. I ain't dead. Nobody covered US. I'm cold. [Sirens] Where's their money? Ask the ambulance guys. The ambulance didn't arrive for, uh... 29 minutes. We know those men were carrying a large sum of money. Now, where is it? Wait a minute. Where is the money? Inspector, we are so tired of this. Would you please put US in front of a grand jury? Pending my investigation, I want these men assigned to desk duty. Inspector novick, these are two of my best men. Desk duty... Now... Until further notice. Lieutenant o'shaughnessy, when do we go before a grand jury? I mean, nobody ever killed two guys before and didn't go before a grand jury. Hantz, the, um... You're all scared to put US in front of a grand jury. The captain wants to see you. What do you got to do to get attention around here, kiss the mayor in Macy's window? Better watch out. These s.O.B.S will throw you to the knapp commission. I'm in trouble there myself. Congratulations. Had a nice thing going in the 8-0. Now it's too hot up there. We're figuring to move it down here to the 2-1. You interested? You're new around here. Carter price. Carter? Carter price, how you doing? I've had a few raw deals myself. Oh, yeah? Sorry to hear that. Maybe we could, uh... Help each other. Yeah? How could we do that? Look, I still got some hooks here and there. I could get you and hantz back on the street. That would be quite profitable all the way around. Do I interest you at all? Uh...ha ha! Tell you one thing, man. I'm sick and tired of being called a crook and not getting nothing for it. Look, discuss it with hantz. I'll be at the fish delight hut. Wait a minute. Fish delight... What, hut? Fish delight hut. For god's sakes, make sure nobody's tailing you. Yeah, you bet, there, Carter. Carter, how you doing? You know my partner Bob hantz. We discussed your offer. We agree we could use the money. How would 300 a week sound to you? That all depends. Who's your man? No, no names, Dave. I'll just say that on Columbus day, he marches with all the other good Italians. You got me? Yeah, perfect. What do we do for him exactly? Well, the man works out of a trailer. It's, like, his headquarters. He'd park it in your sector. You'd see to it nobody would take notice of who came and went. You boys want something? No, no, no, thanks. All right, we want $500 a week. O.k. Ahem. You're very easy to do business with, Carter. 4, 5. 500 down payment. Patrolman Greenberg, I'm lieutenant Stratton. I arrest you for taking a bribe. Good. Patrolman price, I'm arresting you for offering a bribe to an officer. You can't arrest him! You're under arrest. Well, I ain't. Lieutenant strabull... Stratton! Whatever. I arrest you for conspiracy to bribe an officer. Now, lean up against that counter. You damn lunatic, I'm attached to the knapp commission! You get on the counter, you mother, you got no evidence, you hear me? Drop it! Come here. You a policewoman? That's right, buster. The knapp commission, too? Right again. [Greenberg] All right, i'm arresting you, also, for entrapment and conspiracy. Drop dead. Who are you transmitting to? You'll find out. Why the hell did you do this, man? Do you hate US or something? It's nothing personal. Then why in hell, man? They had something on me, so they turned me. Price, you knock that off! [Tires squealing] [Car door opens and closes] Inspector novick... Get out of my way. You stupid hippie cops. Why aren't your prisoners in handcuffs? Well, sir, it's not 100% clear who is a prisoner. What? We have them taped and witnessed taking a bribe from an undercover agent. [Greenberg] I beg your pardon, sir. Hantz and me is the undercover agents. We have you taped for attempted bribe and conspiracy. Did you wire them, krasna? No, sir. Captain arbow did. He's internal affairs. I do not believe this! [Krasna] You didn't know your bureau had my boys all wired up? I sent you a memo via channels. It must have got lost. Where is that tape you made? In my car. Arbow, you get it and bring it to me. [Greenberg] Uh, sir, excuse me. I wouldn't do that if I were you. That tape is evidence for attempted bribe and conspiracy. Don't be a stupid jerk, Greenberg. This whole foul-up is under the direct orders of the knapp commission! Good. We'll put it on the arrest records. Bobby, we're going to need transportation for... Let me see... Four prisoners! Uh, excuse me. I beg your pardon, sir. I sure would appreciate an apology for calling US stupid hippie cops! Not if I was hung by my ears from the empire state building. Guns and narcotics are instruments of death in our society. These men being promoted today to detective third grade have waged their own war on crime in our city. They are men of great imagination, efficiency, integrity, and bravery. Every officer in this department should try to emulate their behavior. David! Bobby. Hey! [Novick] Wait a minute. You are crooked, both of you. There's no other way to explain how you've operated. I can't prove that now, and I'm even certain you'll find idiots to admire you... Batman and Robin! The great individualists, the great system-beaters, the friends of the poor! Just a minute. I want you boys to meet your new captain. I've told him all about you. [Novick] Captain Randolph. Welcome to me, boys.
