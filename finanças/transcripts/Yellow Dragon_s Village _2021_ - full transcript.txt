Hey, baby. What's that? Vodka! You're drinking it! Glug it down! - Go to a hotel. - Don't waste time! I want to go camping. Everyone's working while we're going camping! Wake up! It's morning! Time to stretch! I bet he'll sprint now. Wanna honk? What's that silver jacket? Don't squeak! You go trekking in that? Close it! Hands off! Terrace House? Never seen it. - Emika? - She said that. She wants them to break up. But it's really evil of her. It's party time! You're weird! Drink up, Makoto. Why not? - Drink it! - Okay! Which one do you want? This. Strong. - Still talking about Terrace House. - Geeks. Reality TV geeks! Don't pee now, Takanori! What do you want? The heater? Hands off! Stop messing round! He really has to piss. - The 3 in the back are asleep? - Yeah. Or they're meditating! Ding-dong! Waiter, where's my meat? Just a second! OK! Ding-dong! You haven't been at college for a while, Keisaku... Were you studying abroad? Oh, well... I killed someone. What the hell? I was in prison. You badass! Keisaku is out of control! And meat... Thanks. Whoa, you must be starving. A weenie...! Oh. Nagomi wants it in her mouth... - She can't stop staring. - I'm not! It's hot! Look at the camera please. Lucky Frankie. He loves carrot. This is Mutsuo! - Kento's lonely. - No way. He just thinks it's cool to stand apart and eat meat. Let's toast to us! Cheers! Join us, Kento Kajiwara! Thanks for that! I got shooed away. He's been waiting for a chance to give someone the brush-off. Kento lives for this moment. Did you say, YouTube? You know a YouTuber, Kenichi? Whoa, he talks! You're talking! He is her brother. Yeah. And we have a little sister. You do? Your dad runs an incineration plant? Yes, for garbage. How about bodies? Dead bodies. Go for it! I'm unhappy. Tell us what happened, Yuki. We have a flat tire. We have a flat tire! Go on, fix it! We're out of range and the car's broken down. Any comment, Takanori? Yeah... it sucks. I'm feeling good! "Tatsukiri Village"? Let's get help. They'll have Wi-Fi. Let's find someone. My legs are going to drop off! - No connection. - That's impossible! We're lost and stranded! That's not funny. Let's keep it nice... Mutsuo, tell a joke that makes the girls laugh. I don't know any jokes. Sure you do! You don't. - What's that? - What's he burning? Spooky... I'll go. He's going! Hey... Sir. Hello? Grandpa! Can you hear me? Listen! Our tire is flat so... What's wrong? I'm heartbroken. You did well! Thank you! Want to say, Hi? No. Leave him alone. Hello! Shit! - It's a scarecrow. - What for? - What for? - Come on, stop that! Stop it. A movie crew probably left it behind. Or a TV crew... Maybe not. A donkey! It's a horse. Hey there. What are you kids doing here? There's nothing around here. Our car has a flat tire so... I see, I see. Let me help you out. First off, why don't you come to my place for tea. It's right over there. Follow me. Thank you, sir! Don't be so polite, we're friends. Come on. Is it okay? - So this is Tatsukiri Village. - That's right. It's in the middle of nowhere but folks are nice here. My name is Shinjiro. Nice to meet you. Likewise. You have an Osaka accent? Yes. Does it sound strange? No. Many people from Osaka live in Tokyo too. - Osaka is nice. - It is. That's my house. Go and let yourselves in. I'll go and park the horse. Awesome. What's wrong? Look how beautiful it is! I want to live here. I hate the countryside. Cut it out, can't you try to have fun? Why did you come? - I have a reason. - What? To relive my lost youth... - What? - Huh? What? - Here we are. - Whoa! Welcome to our village. My name is Chiyo. Please come in. Hi, I'm Yuki. I'm Takanori. I'm Nagomi. I'm Urara. Thank you for having us! - He rode a horse! - Shinjiro, yeah... - How random! - I'm his pal now. You are? What about our cabin reservation? There's no Wi-Fi so I couldn't cancel it. Look at the hot pots. What are they for? Is this for us? Oh, thank you! - Thank you. - No problem. Can you write your names here? OK. I'm back. Welcome back. Hello, again. This is Naomi. Did you say hello? My name is Naomi. Nice to have you here. - Is she your granddaughter? - Huh? Elders are respected in this village. When new young ones come along, they do everything. Got it? Here's your dinner. Let us do it! It's OK. Did you burn your hand? I'm fine. Don't worry! We don't use pot-holders. We don't want young people acting like wimps. That's right! I see! That's one way to discipline kids. I know what it is... This is... This is a great house you've got! I mean it. It's quite something, Shinjiro. Go ahead. Don't be polite. Thank you. I can help myself. Chug it down! Yum! What kind of meat is this? What kind? It's delicious meat. Keep eating. Sir. It feels wrong to eat this feast when they can't join us... Chiyo doesn't eat meat because she's... What do you call it? A vegan. She's a vegan so she can eat beans. Sorry? Beans for vegans. Get it? Shinjiro, you're funny! You got it, right? We have a flat tire. Can we get it fixed somewhere? You guys are lucky. - I'll fix it first thing tomorrow. - Really! You. Can you help me with it? Me? OK, I'll help you. It's late. Why don't you stay over? No, we can't. You've already been so generous... You can go as soon as I fix it. It's OK. You're eating with us. Sleeping over is no big deal. Don't be so polite. Stay over! Right? Right? Right? Clean up the table so we can sleep. I wanted to sleep in the cabin! I'm sorry! You could've said no! But you saw how he insisted... You could have! I'm sorry that the trip is ruined... You didn't ruin it, Takanori. - Isn't this place spooky? - How? You know what I mean. Like the... What? The futons were prepared before we arrived. Like they expected us. That's creepy! Don't talk like that! I mean it! Like, why did they want our names? And he went on about beans for vegans... I think that guy's lost it. He's demented. - I know... - He's over the top. He's insane. I had to humor the guy... I can't wait! It's cold... That's weird... Wake up. Up, idiot! Where's Keisaku? Let's get out of here! Something's wrong! - Go away! I have no makeup on. - Shut up! Your breakfast is ready. It's set for 7... Because Keisuke's not here. You're being paranoid. I'm cold... "Help me." Oh, it's so delicious! Why aren't you eating? It's delicious. Thanks... It's nice. Is he dead? You kids have been chosen. We can go into the details later. Sorry but we have to follow the village rules. You. Yes, you! Take off your clothes. Come on, strip off! Nice jacket. It stinks. Somebody help me...! Don't move! - Sis- - - Back off! Somebody! Mutsuo, help! This one! Help me! Mutsuo! Let's make babies! Get up and follow me! Get up, you idiots! Come on, move it! We'll begin our sacred ritual. Your full cooperation will be appreciated. Stand up please. This is Takanori. We carved the meat from his body and drained the blood. What did you do that for? Just following village rules. Why are you doing this? It's the rule! You don't ask why! Right? Like the school rule about not dying your hair! This is our rule! When in Rome, right? Didn't your mommy tell you? That's why. You're the ones who came to our village after all. None of that makes any sense... Let's make this a good one! Divine Obintawara, this is our latest catch. We hope it pleases you. Obintawara...? Divine Obintawara demands the next dish. Next... Ms. Nagomi Endo! Please stand. Get up! Step this way. Freeze or I promise I'll fucking shoot! You're going nowhere! Kill them! Let's go and get them. You're out! No! Not my face please! I hate cold water! What the hell...! Let's get this done. He got away. But not for long. There's one in the car. Send Riko to retrieve him. Yes, sir. I'll kill them all! Well done. What's wrong? Naomi, you need to pull your weight. Riko, go get their car. There's dead prey in it. Here's to us, guys! Or they're meditating... - Yeah! - Who invited them? I know why they came. You suggested it in the group chat. What's going on? That's strange... Check him out. Son of a bitch! - That was close. - Piss off. - Focus. - Piss off. - Thank me. - Your sister's pesky too! - Don't be cocky. - The bulletproof vest was my idea. Hey. Who the hell are you? I'm Kento Kajiwara. My grandma died in your ritual. So I've been preparing all my life to get revenge. Look, his lungs are punctured. It's a tension pneumothorax. The air's trapped. - You'll die soon. - Hear that? He's dead. Let's go. You OK, Makoto? Hi, guys. I'm done here. Roger. You OK, Keisaku? Hey. No problem. You got them all? OK and out. Well? Just as planned. - We'll kill them all. - Let's go. Who did this...? I'd say Kajiwara did it... There're 2 bodies missing. Kajiwara? I know that name. Miyoko Kajiwara, 1998... Her kin is seeking revenge! What's that? Yo. Speak, Kajiwara! Not bad! You figured it out! What's your move? We're going to massacre you. No, you will die. Wrong. We'll kill you. It's war then! I'm right here. Ciao. What will we do? Should we ask the Lord? We can take care of those city pests. Get the young ones onto them. Will do. I'll kill you! Finally. I can avenge my brother's death. That is important but keep your cool, guys. Remember my message about who to watch out for? One is Chiyo with the weird kung-fu. And the guy who has a way with samurai swords. You can go ahead and kill them. But if it's too much for you, I'll kill them. Like I said, we have someone working undercover. So be aware of that. We'll sleep and start early. I can't wait to have beer after this. - Good job. - Thanks, Bro. There are 10 of them to deal with. Kento's in charge but I find him kind of unreliable. I know. You OK? More than ever. - Make it quick. - Will do. I'll take care of the others. I'll make sushi out of ya. You're real tough. It's hot! Hey. I'm beat. Can you go by yourself? OK. 1 minute and we switch. I'm fucked. He's better than I thought. It's only been 47 seconds. Loosen up, big guy. Your go. Kajiwara! Help me! Come on! Chiyo. Good timing, Naomi. Wanna finish her off? What took you? Well, I've been stuck here for 6 months. - You offered. - For you! Are you here to talk or what? Guys. You wasted so much time fighting it out... Well, why don't you shoot him? Damn! We're totally screwed! We need divine help. Oh, I feel better now. - You're rusty. - From living in this dump. Are you done? - You OK? - No, I'm not. Finally I have both my sisters here. I'm elated! I'm so tired. If you don't mind, I'll kill her. Go ahead. Here I go. Next! We have some intruders and... We're fucked! We need your help! I'm hungry. I want food! Let me eat them all up! Certainly. I'm starving! Excuse me, I have to go... Kotaro! Kotaro! Get over here! What? You look delicious. So we got them all? We've been killing all night. We still haven't found the leader. I'll kill you all! - Will you punch him? - Smart-ass! I want to sleep. You killed the innocent villagers, you devils! You can talk! It's Divine Obintawara's order. There's no such thing! Come out! Come out from there! I surrender. And the other 2! Come on! I surrender. 1 more! I surrender. We're sorry! Who are you guys? We're the future of this country. Senile old ritual followers like you should die. Damn you! What was that? It's OK. It's them... You brought a bomb? Just in case. We're prepared. Let's take the dead villagers to Dad's incinerator. Let's go. We got it done! - Good job. - Thank you. Put the gun away. It's over. I hear you. I want to go back to Tokyo... There's one. That's a big target to miss. You take him, Keisaku. He's your size. No way! I've got trigger finger. So what? I haven't slept! Question him. Me? OK, I'll play cop. Excuse me, monster. Can you show me your ID? Irrational... It's irrational! What? You killed all the villagers. That's right. You one of them? No! I am their god. I live off the ritual meat they offer me. Are you Divine Obintawara? That's right. They call me Divine Obintawara. I was brought here when I was little. They put me in the small room. And I became Divine Obintawara. I ate Mom and Dad! They were really delicious! So he was abducted! Those meatheads are beyond me! You answer me! Who is going to prepare my meals from now on? You won't starve. I'll make it easier for you. Give me your flesh! I'll eat you! Makoto! Don't eat me! Thanks. You OK? You did it. You guys beat that monster. Yeah, we worked while you slept! Sorry I wasn't much help. You're the brains, bro. You should work out. Let's dispose of the bodies. Can't I sleep? But when we're done... A wrap party! The End Atomu Mizuishi Takuya Matsumoto Mayu Suzuki, Yuni Akino Zingi Umemoto Shioka Ishizuka, Kenta Osaka Shiori Ueno Cheers. We did it. That hit the spot! It's so good... My throat and face were injured. Will medical expenses cover it? Sorry? I'm going to hospital. Expenses? - You're the budget guy. - Yes. Masayuki Inou I got trigger finger. That's besides the point. I paid for everything out of my own pocket. How much? 7 digits. You spent that on weapons... To make it easier... I didn't use them. But remember, I killed the most. Written, Directed and Edited by Hugo Sakamoto So what's up? Not much. I wanted to work for myself so I started a cleaning business. Really? That's sudden! You know the serial bomber? So I thought I'd get to work. Kento, I got food! What are you doing? Is that Obintawara...? My new assistant. What's that? I love Tokyo! I can't wait to eat the bomber! Right, Kento? I hope he's delicious. English subtitles by Dean Shimauchi ©2021 YELLOW DRAGON'S VILLAGE Film Partners
