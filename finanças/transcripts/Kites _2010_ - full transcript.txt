Kites... ...fly in the sky... ...free... ...dancing in the wind... ...with no worries... ...like two lovers... ...they meet... ...they fight, they embrace... ...they almost become one. But it is not the will of the kites... ...that makes them dance. Because some one else... ...always holds the strings. Kites vn151502510 May God be with you, son. Thank you. Mr. J. I hope you find... ...the love of your life. Las Vegas. City of dreams. Here you'll find a lot of taxi drivers who were once millionaires... ...and lots of millionaires... ...who are now taxi drivers. Everyone here is looking for the same thing. That one life changing roll of dice. That one lucky break. So am I. - A beer, please. - Okay. Often people fear God. But I don't. - One beer and change for 100. - Thanks. Because my God is money. As of now, however, I'm earning only 100 dollars per week... ...teaching at the Leko dance academy. I might have already been rich. But my timing sucked. Every time Lady Luck came knocking... ...I'd be in the shower. The things I did, to earn a living... ...sold popcorn... ...performed death-defying stunts... ...resorted to piracy... And when things got really tough... ...I got hitched. Yup... fake marriages. Green card scam. They got their citizenship... ...and I got hard cash. How much this time? She is a poor little thing. 1.000 dollars... ...and extra for the honeymoon. And Robin had a knack of finding... ...these women, over and over. I found you a husband. He wants 700 dollars. And I want 250 dollars as advance. Who is he? She can't speak English... ...and you can't speak Spanish. How exactly did you fall in love? Well, love and music, sir... ...have no language. Our love... ...it's more than words. Happy Valentine's Day, J. Where did you... How did you? Oh, hey... hey... One second. What are you doing here? How did you get in? I stole the key from your locker... ...and make a duplicate of it. What? Where do I keep this? What are you doing? Tidying up your place. Why? I can't live in a dirty house. Okay, look. You're freaking me out now. Alright? Sit here. Come. Are you crazy or something? I love you, J. Oh, that's it. Alright. You got to go. Get the hell out of here. - You gotta go now. - J... J... Listen. I know... I know you love me, J. The way you touch me, I can feel it. You've lost your mind. Just leave. Or I'll inform the cops on you. Just get the hell out of here. - J... J... - Just go. I... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so rude... I'm very sorry. But the thing is... ...I don't love you. Do you have a girl-friend? No. Boy-friend? Go home, I'll hail a cab. I don't need a cab. I have a car waiting. I'm sorry. I'll never bother you again. There... ...as I said. She knocked... ...but the shower drowned out the sounds. I had missed one vital piece of information... ...daughter of Bob Grover... ...owner of one of the biggest casino's in Vegas. Hey. Look, I just want to say sorry again. May I ask you something? Would you like to be my partner? I mean, in the dance competition it's next week. It wasn't difficult convincing Gina. We kept getting closer. And I knew... Come on, J. Come on, man. Come on, J. "Love and lust can make you go blind". "Devil playing with your mind". "Yeah fire... fire... love is hell got to sell". "Sell your soul. Sell your soul. Sell your soul". "Fire... fire... love is hell got to sell". "Sell your soul. Sell your soul. Sell your soul". "Love and lust can make you go blind". "Devil playing with your mind". "Love is the game you play". "And pain is the price you pay". "If you want to go all the way". "You got to go for it today". "Don't listen to the words they say". "Forever is an old cliché". "No matter how hard you pray... ...love is never going to stay". "Fire... fire... love is hell got to sell". "Sell your soul". "Love and lust can make you go blind". "Devil playing with your mind. Yeah... fire, fire". "Love is hell got to sell". "Sell your soul... fire... fire". "Love is hell got to sell". "Sell your soul... sell your soul..." "Love is hell got to sell". "Sell your soul". - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you so much. - Mom... - Hello, sir. - I am J. - Congratulations. - It's so nice to meet you, sir... Thank you so much, sir. - It was terrific. What an amazing performance. Thank you. But the one who truly deserves the compliment... ...is her, she worked so hard. Don't be modest, son. It's all due to your effort. It's after ages that I am seeing her so happy. And you are the reason. - Well, thank you so much, sir. It makes me happy. - Mom. Why don't we invite J? Of course. It's my son Tony's engagement party this weekend... ...at my beach house. You must come. J... please. You know... I'm a... Son... In Vegas, nobody says "no" to Bob. Well, I guess... then my answer will have to be a "yes". You don't have to do this for me. Oh, you'll get used to it, Sir. I don't think so. This alley is too small for the limousine. You've got to take a left from up there. I know these roads, Sir. I live in the next block. - Really? - Yes, sir. Well, it's nice to meet you... Jamaal. ...Jamaal. Bye. Gina was on cloud nine. She loved me, quite clearly. And I loved her too, for her wealth, her legacy. I just had to keep pretending... ...and that was never a problem. You're right, it's all for her. My plan was working. Every day I was a step closer to fulfilling all my dreams. Well, almost. I still had no control... ...over destiny. J... ...Tony is here. She's great, isn't she? Sexy... exotic... wild. She's one of a kind... ...right? I'd better not catch you starting at her again. Oh, you're tough. I'm Tony... ...Gina's brother. Love you, brother. Meet my fiancée, Natasha. My love, come over. This is J. You guys met at a dance class? You got to be kidding me. It's boring. Wanna know how Natasha and I met? I was driving... ...fast, just like I always do. And bang. I'd slammed into her. I stopped. Got off the car. What do I see? Two hot, sexy legs. Long, smooth road to heaven. I just telling them that... ...you have legs to die for, baby. And there she was... ...with those legs, unconscious... Luckily, she wasn't seriously injured. She opened her eyes... ...looked into mine... ...that's when I knew... ...I had to make her my wife. - How much? - 242 dollars. - 200 and what? - 42. - 200 and how much? - 42. Of course, the 42 dollars. I wonder how Tony would react... ...if he found out that the woman who would to be his fiancée tomorrow... ...was once my wife. Wait a minute. Not was. She still is my wife. Why does my heart exult in rapture. Why does my heart exult in rapture. It yearns... to be liberated. It wanders away... ...towards you. Linda was once of the eleven. The last of my illegal immigrant wives. Strangely, I don't even remember the other ten. But Linda. She was the only one... ...who had affected me. She can't speak English... ...and you can't speak Spanish. How exactly did you fall in love? Well, love and music, sir... ...have no language. Our love... ...it's more than words. 200, 300, 400. Dude. She is 42 dollars short. You are 42 dollars short. How will I earn my commission? Give me 42 dollars. Right now. I don't have anymore money. I'll pay it later? No, don't try conning us. What's the guarantee? I want 42 dollars, right now. C'mon, give me my money. 42 dollars... - But I have nothing more. - You understand? I want... ...my money, 42 dollars. "Four" and "two", 42. Fine. Here take this sweater, I paid "four" dollars for it. And you can have my bra... it cost me "two" dollars. So that's "four" for the sweater and "two" for the bra. So that's "four" and "two", 42... Here take it. Satisfied? Satisfied? Happy? She's lost it. "Four" dollars for the sweater and "two" for the bra. So 42? Think I should teach her some math... Why does my heart exult in rapture. It yearns... to be liberated. It wanders away... ...towards you. And so it began. But my heart paid no heed. And so it began. But my heart paid no heed. It raced ahead. Utterly lost. And now... so am I... Why does my heart exult in rapture. It yearns... to be liberated. It wanders away... ...towards you. Natasha. Excuse me. Can you help me charge this phone, please? Yeah... Let me see. You okay, man? Can I... ...have some water, please? Yeah, sure. There's some down the end there. Hey... hey, hey man... Oh, come on. - J... - Hi Bob. I'm sorry, but my hands are a little dirty. What happened, dad? Caught these scoundrels stealing. And you know very well... ...how much... ...I hate dishonesty. No, no, please... I'm sorry. No, no. Bob, no. No... no... - I will return everything. - Shut up. - I'm sorry... - Shut up. You kill him. Come on, J. Go get him. Come on, J. Take the gun. You can do it. Don't kill me. I'm sorry. There is no point in killing you. Go back and tell everyone... ...what happens to those who cheat this family. And if I ever see you around here again... ...your fate will be as good as his. Get it? Thanks. Not a bad idea. Gina chose well. Whenever there's a big heist... ...or a new construction here... ...we always get out share of the profit. Everybody in this city... ...Law, Police, Senators, Governors... ...are all good friends of ours. Now, keep this. You'll need it. And these are the keys to your new car. Welcome to the family. Thank you. You do love Gina... don't you? Of course, Bob. I love her. I'll hate to see her cry. Strangely, for the first time in my life... I hesitated before I lied. I felt unsure of myself... ...confused. I had everything I wanted right here, with Gina. But Linda was doing it again... ...affecting me. She was getting married tomorrow... ...and that made me so uncomfortable. She was messing me up. I just couldn't get her out of my head. Hi, Robin. Listen, how do I say this in Spanish? What's that? How do I say this in Spanish? Ok... Go ahead. I think you should get divorced... before you marry another. If tonight... No, hold on... uhm... Maybe it would be best to finalize our divorce tonight itself. What? What are you saying, J? Hurry up, Robin... I'm running out of time. Alright... Take it down. Uhm. I think... we should get our divorced... ...before you marry another. Why don't we meet tonight and finalize our divorced? I'm not interested in the fine details of you know... ...flowers or the invitations... or decorations or anything like that. No Mom... you have been great. Baby, I would like to spend tonight in my apartment... ...is that Ok? What did she say? She wants to spend the last night... ...before her wedding at her place. Alright. Why don't you teach her some Hindi or English? How will we ever communicate? I'll leave her with you after the honeymoon. You can teach her whatever you want. And don't worry. She's a fast learner. Sir... ...money can buy you happiness... ...if you know where to shop. I know this family very well. Don't mess with them. Good night, my love. You know I... - No, you... - No, you say... No, please... you were about to say something. Say... Say. Okay. What I was saying was... Do you love Tony? I love... ...his money. Okay. - You? - Me? Love Gina? Okay. It's the same. Look here... This, 5,000 dollars. - 5,000... wow... - Yes. And this 12,000. 12,000? Perfect. You see this? 15,000. 15,000 dollars. Hold on. I'm not done yet. Hold on. 40,000. - 40,000 dollars. - Goodbye poverty. Bye... poverty. No poverty. Yeah, goodbye poverty. - Goodbye poverty. - Goodbye poverty. Okay... where is... divorce. My divorce? Oh yeah... the divorce. Okay, I... I need a pen. I have a pen. Pen. I, J... ...hereby... ...divorce you Linda. Where's my 42 dollars? 42 dollars? There's gotta be a fair exchange. You know what I'm saying. Okay... those... yeah... those 42 dollars. Show me the money. I like it. You can keep it. Keep the change. Thank you. All good? Good, now... you can do whatever you want. I can do whatever I want. Perfect, huh? Perfect. I wish our marriage were for real. I don't know what you said. But I think... ...me too. Me too. Cheers. Kites... in the sky... ...soaring together. Lovers forever. Forever is a lie. I never wanted that night to end... ...and as I expected... ...it rained. Every time I lose someone... ...it always rains in Vegas. - What? - This... outside... - How do you say? - Rain. - What? Rain. - Rain. You know I was... I was very small... ...when my mother left me. My mother. It was raining that day. Rain. We had no money. She had to go to the hospital. I was... I was too small. And my mother, she just... ...she just hugged me. And kept telling me that she loves me. She was so beautiful. And then... ...and then she left me. And I just, I kept... I kept hugging her hoping that she would... ...you know, come back to me. She didn't. It was raining that day and... ...it's raining today and... ...somebody's going to leave me again. No... no... - No sad. - No sad. Rain... no sad... never. - Come. - What? Come... come with me, please. Just come with me... Please. Who... ...holds the twine in his hands. What has destiny planned? Will the heart understand? You... ...forgot your purse. Thanks. Where have you been? I left you here... ...so where were you? Why don't you answer me? I just want to know where you were. I've come here five times and you're not here, okay. Look at this place, it's a dump, huh? I can offer you a palace. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Why the hell... ...aren't you answering me? Come. Come. Okay, my friend, looks like your phone is all charged up. Seems like you might want to check some messages as well. Here you go. Hmm... your friends have arrived. I found their number and called them to come get you. - You must be here to pick up your friend. - Thank you so much. Yeah... He is in here. Where is he? He was just here... I... Well, he is not here right now. He must be around here, somewhere. I don't know where he went. There's nobody here. The room is empty. Yeah, I know. He was here just a second ago. You called me and you said that he would be here. Hey, look. I've got his wallet. - If you have his wallet, where is he? - Inside. Here's his wallet. Guys, go and find him. He is somewhere close by. Please don't. She left me to die all alone. Why did you do that Linda? Why? Where are you? Thanks David. That's okay, J. You saved my life once. That's why I'm warning you. Don't go back to the casino. You'll be killed. David, I need Jamaal's number. Please. I know he is back in Las Vegas, I know... I'm not going to miss him now. I want him. Jamaal, it's me. J. Yes. Do you know where Natasha is? Yes. I have work around Mandalay Bay at 10 tonight. At 10. See you there. Talk to you late. I want you to go to every street corner, every hotel, every casino... ...every back street, every nook and cranny... ...until you find him. Go. Where have you been? I left you here... ...so where were you? Why don't you answer me? I just want to know where you were. I've come here five times and you're not here, okay. Tell me where you were. Look at this place, it's a dump, huh? I can offer you a palace. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Why the hell... ...aren't you answering me? Come. Tell me what you got. We just located a GPS signal. They're heading south on the Interstate. Tony, leave this to the police. I have suspects on Nuevo Laredo, heading towards Saint's Creek. Bentley halted at 134 on 3169. The police are tracking their current whereabouts. But as of now, J and Natasha are still at large. He has abducted my son's fiancée. Not only that... ...he has stolen two million dollars in cash from my casino. Hey, you thinking what I'm thinking? Are you scared? Scared? Scared... fear... fear? Yes, a little bit. You? Yeah, a little. But it feels good. Feels really good. You and I... ...all we've been through. Yet every moment now. Feels so new. Don't care if it's wrong. I'm prepared to fight. Together now... ...cause it feels so right... Pull over... Don't slow down... driver faster. Memories come back, from another time and place. - Look out. But our love will help, the future to embrace. The path unknown, as far as I can see... But your smile, I know will step up to greet me. You and I, all we've been through. Yet every moment now, is new to know... What are you doing? You see the basket? The basket there? Balloon? The balloons? We have to jump in the balloon. Jump? No, jump. - Trust me, you can do it. - No. Look it's moving really slow. Just go now, don't think. Go, go... Though the setting sun, may cast a spell... ...but our love, we'll have, I know very well. Up in the sky is where we belong. Everywhere we go, our love carries on strong. Our moments together, so unreal and divine. Waltzing back and forth, through rain and shine... Our moments together, so unreal and divine... Waltzing back and forth, through rain and shine... - You're okay? - Yes. Thank you. I am J. Hi... That's Linda. Hi. I am J. "Even you are here and I am here". I am sorry, sir. They escaped in a... what? No... no... please don't let go. Let's go together. Don't do this. Don't... don't let me go. - Trust me. - No. I can't believe this. I just can't believe this. I had money, cars, jewels, everything. And now, I have nothing. Hello? What do I have now? Shut up. This is all your fault. Why did you come with a pistol and point it at Tony? - Why? - Yes, why? Same reason, why you hit him with a bottle. If I hadn't hit him, you'd be died. Do you understand? You should be grateful. Now look that side... turn. Turn and close your eyes. Besides, you seduced me. You do realize that... right? You seduced me. You did all this to me. You kissed me. I kissed you? Yes. I can turn back now? Yes. I kissed you? - Yes, you did. - And you kissed me back. No, you kissed me. - You didn't like it? - No. Well then give it back to me. What? My kiss... give it back. Happy? Yeah. So now it's kisses for everything? - Lunch kiss, dinner kiss, all the time? - Yeah. But I'm feeling hungry. You understand? - No food... hungry... - Okay, I understand. You're hungry, I understand. I'm looking for money. But I don't have any money. Maybe you have money... No, I don't. I have nothing. - just check... - No... Bank... in the bank... Bank? You have money in the bank? Not much, 200 dollars. But let's go. So let's go to the bank? Yes. We go to the bank... ...you say your name "Natasha"... Party over... We go to jail. What's wrong with you? No. It's not Natasha. My name is Linda. Mrs. Linda Ray. Remember? Oh yeah. - Mrs. Linda Ray. - Yeah. - Wife of J. - Yes. Did they say anything to you? Where they jumped off? - Actually, sir... they don't... - No, no... Let me sort this out. Did they say anything to you? You were just in this balloon... with a Mexican woman and an Indian man? These people are very dangerous. You need to tell me what they said and where they are. - The thing is... - Are these people deaf and dumb? Sir, sir. The thing is we are waiting for an interpreter. See, they don't actually speak English. Why the hell did you never learn English? Sir, we found out her name isn't Natasha. It's Linda. She's an illegal immigrant from Mexico. And we know who her husband is on the green card. Who? J. Calm down, Tony. - Calm down. - Ask him to come back. How can I, dad? By now, all of Vegas must have come to know... ...that Natasha and J are married. Take it easy. A shrewd gambler is one who knows when to fold. Come home now. We'll find a way of fixing him. Dad, what do you do if someone's caught cheating in the casino? I'll kill him. Exactly. I want them killed, dad, killed... - Linda Ray. - Linda Ray? And your account number? 0-1... Sorry, 1-0-8-5-2. Okay, and how much do you need today? Pardon... sorry... How much money? Money? All. You got to close it. Okay. I'll be right with you, okay. I'll be right along. Let's go. Ma'am, you need to come with me. Now... Let's go. Don't move. - Easy. - Everybody down. Now... You, come here. - Money. - Okay. Okay. Don't shoot. 200... ...and one million. What did you say? Yes, give me one million and 200. A million? What's wrong with you? Just take your money and let's go. What's wrong with you? We are doing this for 200? What... you want to rob the bank? Just take your money and let's go. Come on, let's go. So stupid. Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go. Open... open the door. What happened? Are you OK? Come on... hurry up. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - Okay. Let's go. Let's go. - How do you drive this thing? I'm... Hold on... one second. You're a crazy woman. What were you doing back there? And what did you call me? Stupid? - Yes, stupid. - You're crazy. She's crazy. - She is right. - What did she say? She's saying, whether you rob a million dollars or 200 dollars... ...you get the same jail term of five years. - And I think she is right. - Yeah, how does she... How do you know that? You're a bank robber? How many banks have you robbed? - You've robbed before? - You should've told me. I'm sick of your Spanish. If I were to start in Hindi, you'd tear your hair out. Should I start? She's saying that this is her first try. Yeah, right. She's got to fool me. She wants to know how you two will survive in 200 dollars. Did she say that? What happened to all the money you got by marrying 11 women? You really married 11 women? You slept with all of them? You... know Hindi? Yes. What are you saying, dude? You are an Indian? Yes, Satpal. From Raipur, India. You're an Indian? I thought, you were a Mexican or something. - No, wife is Mexican. - You're Mexican? No, I am Indian. But my wife is Mexican. He is Indian, his wife is Mexican. Indian-Mexican. Love story. I like that. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. We just robbed a bank. We just robbed a bank. You fall. It was damn funny. I didn't fall, alright. He opened the door. That was his fault. He opened the door. - My fault... - It was just bad timing. Satpal... ...we need the car. And your card? Do you have a business card? Yes, but I don't want to do any business with you. Give it, please. Yeah, here. It's nice. You be good alright. Take care. Notorious thieves, J and Natasha... ...have reportedly taken another million in their crime spree. Slexis White is at the scene. Behind me is the bank where the latest robbery... ...by J and Natasha just took place. They allegedly held a cashier at gun-point... ...and took a hostage on their way out. Beautiful. How you say... ..."I love you" in India? I'm-a-stupid-girl. What? I'm-a-stupid-girl. I'm-a-stupid-girl. Love. How do you say "I love you" in Spanish? ...what? What? Give me my... - Your clothes? - Yeah. Hello. You know what... don't change. So beautiful. No... I just... hold on. Let me... Uhm... Just let me... - No No... bye. - Why? What's the problem? I'm-a-stupid-girl. Me too. You're like... my... father... Like your father? What do you mean? You look like him... ...with the hat. He used to wear a hat? Really? I always wear a hat. I was very small when my father died. Me little... when... my father... passed away. The day he died... ...he wore a hat like this. After that we were left all alone. We were six brothers and sisters. Me... six brothers and sisters. No money... no house. Why did I come to USA? Because I wanted everything for my family. Everything... for my family. What happened with Tony... ...wasn't an accident. No accident... No. I was with Tony because... ...I needed the money. - My family needs money. - I understand. Now I am torn because... ...you here and my family there. Don't be sad. You will never fail your family. You had a dream... ...I had the same dream. Now we have a bigger dream. It was destiny... we had to meet. And I believe if... you and me are together... ...we can do anything. You'll see... ...I'll work... ...we will make lots of money. Lots and lots of money. I can do everything with my hands. I have magic in my hands. See? And one day... ...you... ...and me... ...we will be dancing. Dancing in the rain. - Freeze. - Raise your hands. Drop the gun. Show me your hands. Search the room and arrest them. Hey. Drop your weapons. You boys put those guns down. You hear? Before I get pissed off. Officer, it would be a great pleasure if you just give us the money. What the hell are you talking about? Do we look like a bunch of locos? The money they stole. The three million. I have no idea what you're talking about. Now, we're going to head out to the cars, nice and easy. So don't do anything stupid. We'll all call it a day. You could give them half, you know. Shut up. I'm just saying, you give them half and everyone's happy. He's lying. Amigo, do I look like a liar? They got the money. You ain't going anywhere till we get our money. Move. Go... soon. Get the keys. Headquarters, this is Unit 9. I need backup at Bonanza Creek Ranch. We've got to jump on, Linda. - Just grab these bars and jump. - No, I can't. It'll be okay. I know you can do it. Just go now... just go. Hang on. Hold on. Use your legs, baby climb. Is anyone there? I know it hurts. Just... just stay still... ...one last one... stay still baby... one last one. It's almost done baby. I'm so sorry... so sorry. Don't worry my love. Me... no die. We need babies. Thanks for coming. Hey... come on. What's with the formality? Tell me something... ...what's all this about? That you kidnapped Natasha... ...stole two million from the casino... ...and another from the bank. Do you know every cop... ...every bounty hunter is looking for you? Escape from one and you land into the other's trap. This time you're really screwed. You're right. Yes. There is no escape. Robin... Yeah. Take Natasha away from me. What? Somewhere far away. Are you serious? Yeah. If she stays with me... it's too dangerous. And... ...if something were to happen to her... Just take her away, Robin. And... just take care of her. What about you? I'll be okay. I'll confess that I kidnapped her. I'll give myself up. I'll do something. It doesn't matter. But you have to take her away. She can't stay with me anymore. You have to take her away... okay? What? Told you, didn't it? That when you find true love... nothing else matters. Wasn't right? Yes. Where is she? Hey Linda... hey... Robin... Nice to see you. How are you? He stitched that? No, too bad. We need to get you to the hospital. You have to go to the hospital, Linda. You have to show that to a doctor. There could be infection. You go with Robin... ...I'll be here. I'll wait for you. Let's all go. Baby, if we go together it's too dangerous. You go with him. I'll be right here, it'll take one hour. Come, Robin will take care of you. Come on, let's go... Let's go. What's wrong with you? Do you want to get rid of me? Do you think I'm weak to bear this? I may be weak... ...but I am not confused. I don't know which part of the world you come from... ...but you are my world now. Tony has money and power... ...but we have love. And love is more important than anything else. If I have a day... ...I want with you. A week, a month, a year... ...a life... ...I want with you. Live together... ...die together. Do you understand? I am sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You got both of them? How much do you want? I'll give you 20 thousand dollars. You suck. I'll give you one million dollars. Two million dollars. Tell me where they are. Tell me where she is. Yeah... ...okay... well, I'm... I'm going to come and get her. Yeah, I'll come alone. I promise I'll come alone. How far is it to McLaren, Texas, Ginger? It's about six hours. Yeah, I'm here. Hurry up, cross the road. Cross the road. You have two minutes left. Go on towards the mall. I'm here. I'm right in front of the stage. Come to level four. Why are you making me run? I'm just making sure you are alone. I am alone. Very good then. Come to level four parking lot. And make sure you throw that phone in the trash. I'm watching you. I'm impressed. Enough, Tony. I'm not here to kill you. But I want you to understand something. Natasha and I have wronged your family... ...and for that I'm truly sorry. I am. As for the money... We've already stolen two million from the casino. So, now you're not a liar. Now, I'm letting you live. And, you let us go in peace. We're quits, Tony. You understand that? We're quits. No, J. We will be even the day... ...Natasha leaves you and comes back to me. And she will leave you J. She will leave you. You will search for her and you will never find her. That will be the day... that we call it quits, J. That will be the day. Hurry. Come on. Let's go. How life goes by... In the blink of an eye. How life goes by... In the blink of an eye. For you, I shall wait an eternity... But my love will never fade, you'll see... How life goes by... In the blink of an eye. Stop your vehicle, sir. Passport please. Move along. Move it. With every beat of your heart... My life moves along... I've lost my heart to you... To you it will always belong... With time the insanity will fade... But you and I will always remain... For you, I shall wait an eternity... But my love will never fade, you'll see... I've been in this business for 20 years. You won't face any problems. Ask him how long? How long will it take? One week. In one week... ready. - Take care... - I'll see you soon. One week. In just one week, I'll get the passports. Just hang in there for a week. Then the world is yours, go wherever you'll want. Mamma... mamma... I am here. Our love will last a lifetime... Lost in each other... The dream ours to live... Our paths now bound together... Without you... I'll wither away... Won't last more than a day... This marriage is a sacred union... ...in the presence of God. What God unites, none can separate. J, do you accept Linda as your wife... ...in both sickness and health? Say "yes". Yes. Linda, do you accept J as you husband... ...in both sickness and health? Yes. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Kiss me... now. What? Could you be a bit louder? What did I say? What did I say? Nothing. I said... I said "I love her". No? What did I say? You said, "you shit in your pants". Okay. What? You... ...added color to my life... ...my... ...black and white life... You are... ...everything to me. "Ti amo". That is... ...I love you. J... J... J, where are you? Where are you, Linda? J. What the... This is wicked, man. Robin. Robin. Hold on. Robin. - J... - Robin. We have to go, Linda. You are bleeding. I am okay. You are bleeding, my love. Drive the car, Linda. Drive the car. No. Jamaal... move. We need to have babies, remember? Please don't leave me alone. Please... don't go... baby... ...please open your eyes. My love... Okay. I love you. Linda... Linda... Linda... Where is Natasha, Tony? You should know better. She was with you. Please, Tony... I told you, that she would leave you one day. I told you, and now she has. It's all your fault. - Just tell me where... - It's your fault. Your fault. - You ruined your life. - Just tell me where she is. Where is she, Tony? Tell me where she is? I just want to see her once. I just want to know why... Please Tony. Shut the hell up. Just tell me where she is. Shut the hell up, J. Go get them. Watch out. Where is she, Jamaal? Tell me where she is? I love you. Don't worry, I won't let them catch us. I love you. Linda... Go... go... go...
