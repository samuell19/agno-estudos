Carit? is the small shelf placed on top of a wall or niche in tapial houses, where women hide, out of reach of children, its threads, comb, tobacco and pipe. "Vitalina" is the girl who gets ready. She puts on makeup and makeup, and doesn't find a husband. And so, "the vitalina stayed in Carit?", it's like saying that it has stayed on the shelf, without utility, forgotten, kept intact. My dear San Antonio, I ask you in supplication. Give me my first husband, I get the second later. My dear Saint Anthony, my saint in flesh and blood, If you don't give me a husband, I'm not going to take you out of the well. Watch this. Time is getting old. I never even kissed on the mouth. My holy Filomena of the kisses kept on the pillow... The perspiration is too much... It is a warm and fat insomnia. It's hard for the night to fall in my eyes. Today is June 13. The day of love. Look at this, what a beautiful thing! Look. Not a day went by without adding a flower, an embroidery... Mary! Hurry up, woman! The sun is in a hurry to be born. Did you bring it? Everything? Did you write down all the letters of the alphabet on paper? Yes, and I added W and Y. For what? What do I know, there you marry someone who has a foreigner's name. Wesley... Yudson... It's cute, like movie. When they talk, we look down to See the words dressed in Portuguese. You must say the prayer and the paper that opens first. It will show the letter of the man who will marry you. My great friend San Antonio, you who are the protector of the couple, look at me, my life, my desires... It's opening, Maria! It opens! It didn't open... May my courtship be happy and my love without measures, because even the toads and insects that approach me are female. It's going to open, it's going to open! It did not open. May all the bride and groom seek communion in life and grow in faith. - So be it... - It opened! - It opened! - It opened! What is the letter? The paper is illegible. Was it too much to ask that you use ink that would not be erased in the water? You are very intelligent, you succeed of so much "intelligentness". And what will happen now? I will have to wait until June 13 of next year! Finita, listen to me. I swore my whole life and I will swear once more. I'm just leaving Carito in the arms of my true love. It doesn't take forever. Isn't eternity too long, Maria? How can a father do that to a daughter without first asking? Entrust me to the Holy Djalminha, and I keep myself to him. I was stuck with that promise since I was born. As he did to save you from death. Why didn't he promise an ox, a donkey, a house? Did I have to promise my virginity? Offer it to a saint? Promising using the fruit of others is easy. It Seems nice to be a saint's girlfriend, It's better than being nobody's girlfriend. But, Finita... My body is warming up, because I already entered the realm of "less pause" a long time ago. You know what it means? That the parts decrease, they stop working. Upon entering this stage, everything becomes dehydrated. Like a dried plum. Look at old age. It is approaching me. These are the two candidates that will bring our flock back, brothers. Do you think that is enough to overcome the dispute between the churches who say "God pay him", but take away the money from the people? The simple announcement of the candidacy of Jos? Santo already attracted crowds. The diocese has been congratulated by the Holy Pope. And like Jos? Santo, Mar?a de Carit? has proven miracles. There is no doubt about my mysticism. Is there news of your pudendas parts? The father kept it to be delivered a virgin to San Djalminha. - How holy is that? - San Djalminha. The patron of the city. Now we have to put together this vow of chastity to the votes of the next municipal elections. Mary! It is time to pray kneeling in the corn before the precession. I'm going! I learned that San Antonio. He reserved a special place for you in his car. But dad, I am so out of place up there. Let the younger girls do it. I'm not here to get in the car. A virgin is not old. Purity makes you a girl. And a saint. I already told you a thousand times that I am not a saint. It Is faith that makes things happen. I do not do anything. It seems that milk came out of your sweat tonight. Mary, Did you dream of a sin? Or is it easy woman's boldness? It's my body that talks to me, dad. Well, become deaf. And keep those night thoughts. And hurry up! You can't leave a saint waiting. The elixir of the virgin! Today is in promotion! The elixir! Who will want it? Brothers Sisters... On behalf of the Holy Mother Church, I am proud to announce that the candidacy to canonize Mar?a de Carit?, It has been accepted unanimously! My daughter has been kept pure and holy for San Djalminha, without any trace of men on his body! Hallelujah! This Monday, The closing process for our future Santita will begin. Monday... Hail Saint Mary of Carit?! Live! Now, all on your knees... Not you! Not you! Our father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Your kingdom come to us, Your will be done, so on Earth as in Heaven. WELCOME TO ?SULA. Don't get like this, Maria, the day is not over yet. Didn't you hear, Finita? I was promised to a saint. I Will stay in that convent until I die. Or do you think there is tucutucu in heaven? Not even in memory I will carry the tucutucu. What if we go to the party in the square? This year there is a seer who reads the letters. I don't want to hear from any gypsy. All I need is true love. I can't stand this fire under my skirt anymore. Not even this sad sadness in my chest. You did not understand, Maria. They say that gypsy makes the untouched person of Carit?. Find your true love in less than 24 hours. Then they understood, right? I take care of them below and the little saint takes care of them from above. Isn't this metaphor cute? Good morning, my people! Good morning! You wear the shoe for one foot, and the other after the elections. Look! The shoe that did not deliver I will put it in the head. You went crazy? That man kisses the Devil's cheek upon waking and the other cheek when he lies down. Come on. Come in, Carito. He said my name! It is really very good. - Give me money, Finita. - I? I know you have money! Did you see what you had? Is that clear? It is San Djalminha. He is the saint for whom my dad swore my virginity in case he was born healthy and saved. What's your name? Name! And I demand a sign first. I will only pay if there is a guarantee. But you are an incredulous saint. Cursing me is not going to help! I do not have a husband, I am committed to one San Djalminha, that nobody knows him. I'm already cursed! I am a maiden, but I am not lela. Sirs! Ladies, ladies! Town of ?rsula! It is a great pleasure to introduce you our great circus Eita! After a very successful tour, We are here in this small, but honest city, with our acclaimed cast and the brightness of his performances unmatched! Do not miss our great Russian heartthrob: Anatoli! Look, Finita! I got goosebumps. Our lovely, cute and delicate dancer, Naive! Go away, cute man! And if my dad sees you here, It will take you to the judgment of Jesus. Ah, Dostoevsky! If to receive your kiss, I must die... ...I will die happy! With you, I want to go beyond meat. Father! Be careful, miss! You don't go to meat, much less beyond meat! Somebody control this wild! Do you now kiss even the most mature women in the audience? I'm gonna get you! Anatoli! The great circus Eita! Eita! Now you are going to pay me! Let go! Let go! They are very good! I'm shaking! Oh, Antonio de Padua! On the edge of the precipice appeared salvation. It's him, Finita, it has to be him. A Russian artist, a foreigner. My God, how will we communicate? The tables on the book. Maria, where were you? You forgot it? I went to pray for Mrs. Rogaciana. Poor thing, I was very bad at the spine. Who said my daughter can walk around at night? I was so ecstatic about the power of prayer that I didn't even see the moon being born. What do you have in your hand? It is the holy cloth they gave me to get used to. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Father... I am very grateful for saving me from death. Penalty that San Djalminha could not do the same with my mother. I wish I had met her. When your mother died in childbirth, there in front of my eyes, You were next door, passed out. Then, I held on to the faith and said: "My patron saint, save my daughter and I promise that she will be your bride, virgin and sacred." The deal was very clear. You can't dare before marrying the saint. Father... I want to get married while I'm alive. May I? Don't worry, I will divorce before I die. Thus I arrive free for San Djalminha in heaven. Speak Low. What you say is disrespectful to the saint. Being touched by love is not disrespectful. I know what these letters dressed in Portuguese mean. "What does an old girl like you want with a young boy like me?" Ah, my St. Jude Thaddeus, I want to get married. San Ludovico, a very rich boy. St nicolas, Let him be the most! Saint Benedict, may he be beautiful. Saint Gabriel, may he always be faithful. Saint Generous, may he not be jealous. Holy Trinity, give me happiness! And, mainly, San Germano, That does not happen this year. Mary! You have to run to the circus, the girl that fought with the heartthrob, It was so strong that she is gone. This is your chance, woman! You're going? If need makes man, imagine what despair does not. Kasparov! Again with that, Naive? - You are going to pay me! - My face! I'm going to give you stronger! You'll see! - Take it easy! Take it easy! - Damn bastard! You messed with that old woman's colonel! - I? - How could you do this to me? I hope you cut your meat and throw it away! Don't offend my flesh, it has nothing to do with it. - If he doesn't cut it, I do it! - My stage! Calm down, my matroska. Get out of me... Get out of me, man! But, dear, we provide successes, applause, life experience I know very well what life experience you gave me. The.... He looked at the girls in the audience during the act of the knife. While I was throwing my knives... It almost nails me, it almost kills me. Look, I'm all hurt. How awful! But if this is the problem, Fonsequita can take your place. Fonsequita! For me, this circus is over. I'm going. Just one more thing... Well, let's go to work. Fonsequita I can do it? Who's there? Why don't you want to do it? Why don't you want to do it? This place is wonderful. This tent... This man... I'm not feeling well. I'm not feeling well... Who allowed this crazy to enter here? In addition to scoundrel, you are a donkey. We found our new Naive. Will this scrap metal take the place of Ingenua? If it's not her, it will be imitation of people. You choose. You are the prince. Prince does not blow or bite, a prince kisses. In my country, in Russia, We love women like that, intense. We call them Stoniskayas. I melt with the pretty things you say. I saw a little bit of your show in the square, I want to see everything. I am Anatoli... ..."The big one". If I understood correctly... You came to share the act with Anatoli. The gallant and me? Wanting I want, but I can't. Where did that creature come from? She is the saint of the city here, Santa Mar?a de Carit?. A saint in the circus? OMG! This may be more profitable than charging author's rights from Our Father. Go. I'm ready. Curse. - I didn't even feel it. - Are you okay, daughter? Yes, I'm fine, I'm alive. - You...? - Teodora L'Amour. It is a pleasure. Permission, but I have to go, if my dad doesn't find me... - Anatoli will accompany you. - Why? He insists. Needless. I only came to kill the thirst of my eyes. Because I had never been to a circus. Tomorrow we will audition for the place of Ingenua. Why don't you show up? Don't laugh, girl. He needs a person like you. - The? - The circus. Sorry for the question, But are you the saint of miracles as people say? It seems to him that if I had the power to work miracles, Would I still be here with such lack? Anatoli! What happened? Look at you... ...it's like looking at a dream with your eyes open. If there is someone who looks like an awake dream, it's you. May you clean the sins of the world. Can I be honest? You have that bearing, that handling with words, something like a real man. And I don't usually be so close to so much masculinity. My body is not accustomed. My head wobbles. Give yourself to my company, Mariuschka. It is "Maria" in Russian. Surrender... ...as if there was no tomorrow. If it were for me, I would stay here talking forever. But my dad drives away all the pants that come near me. Not even a "conchologist" doctor. And more now than the church people I want to "claustrophobic" in the monastery. I don't want to fill you with ideas, but you have what you call perestroika. Star quality. For me, you were born to be worshiped by many, but to be loved by only one. Yes? Why don't you prepare a small act? And maybe we could both share the "scenicarovisk". Look, Mr. Gal?n, On Monday I will be confined and sealed by everyone in the church forever. What a waste. There is no living soul in this city that feels no pride in me. But I feel that I am an unfinished woman. Because I still haven't found my true love. I'm going to show you how your life is stuck to mine. Get ready. From today, There is a pact between the two of us. A blood and sawdust pact. We join with the finger where the alliance is put. On the finger of commitment. Is that so? Is it the finger of commitment? Mary! There is a soul waiting for you to take it to God. I'm going! Who is it, dad? She is the girlfriend of Colonel Honorio. The poor have disembodied way to the church to get married. So close to the consummation, and it's gone. That is why I say that there are people who have not been made to marry. Are you sure she unplugged her life? It has a vivid color. The Colonel left her there to give him the extreme unction before going to eat land. I? I'm going to look for the man, because he was broken. Don't forget to bless her with your elixir. With that smelly thing? Do you know any remedy with a pleasant smell? But it is the secretion of my sweat. Why would the fluid expelled by my armpits be miraculous? There lies the strength of faith. In my armpits? Elixir of virgin woman is perfume of God. Here there is no perfume of God. If it doesn't serve to bless, At least it will take worms away from the coffin. Do you want to kill me with that poison? But you were dead! I no longer smell anything. You anesthetized my nose forever! Sorry for complaining about you. But your elixir is very powerful. It ruined my five senses. Are you? The colonel has to know that you are not dead, that you came back. I will be eternally grateful for returning to my colonel. Is it love you feel, ex-defendant? - Yes, and a lot. - And when will the new marriage be? You just have to change the decoration of the church, from wake to wedding again. The virgin resurrected me! She negotiated with Jesus! The virgin resurrected me! Colonel! Colonel! - Be careful, Colonel. - I already saw it. I'm going there. Your girlfriend is already in people's mouths, colonel. What did he say? Now people say "The Ex-defendant Bride." Another miracle cataloged from our little saint. And this Jos? Santo. He is so skinny that he looks like a cricket. We sold more images of Jos? Santo than those of Father Cicero. Jos? Santo and Mar?a. Not bad for whom until recently distributed flour to earn faithful. Miracles are miracles, business is separate. In some days we will have Santa Mar?a de Carit? among us. You can sign here. Good. About my, The church and the mayor will walk hand in hand. What God has united, man does not separate him. Mary! Mary! I'm going! Maria, open the door! There is a line of people who want to talk to you. Why is there a line that wants to see me? Everyone already knows that you resurrected the colonel's girlfriend. People want to be anointed by you. Santa Maria de Carit?. From Minas to Piau?. We all pray for you. May God keep you preserved. Consecrated Cobweb. Sealed chastity. Whose key is in Heaven saved. Do these people have nothing else to do? Why don't they go see the novel or plant cassava? - And that song? - It's the anthem they made for you. What is that, Maria? It happened to me when I moved the colonel's girlfriend. To bring it back to life. No daughter. This is the first sore. You are anointed by faith. It's not that, dad. After the resurrection of the colonel's girlfriend, we decided to anticipate your entrance to the cloister after tomorrow. Day after tomorrow? - Sunday will be the big day, Maria. - Dad, help me. I didn't do any miracles, help me. I didn't do any miracles! True saints are like you, Mary, modest. But it is the people who create the saint. And the people want to see you, Maria. These people have a great need for saints. - Long live Santa Mar?a de Carit?! - Live! - San Djalminha's girlfriend! - Live! - Miracle of the town of ?rsula! - Live! Wait, my little saint! Wait! Hi, Mrs. Revicleia! I need to register a grace. Do you remember that my grandson had a nut instead of balls? I put a droplet of your elixir, and I brought you a bag of nuts to thank for the child's balls, Because now they are complete. - Long live Santita! - Live! Let's talk about good things, come on! This is the elixir of the virgin! The reliquary of the little saint! Come closer! So is! Mary! Anatoli is there! I look like a flan in an earthquake. I do not feel my legs. One believes that the north is south and the other that the south is north. They fail to understand each other. Oh, Fonsequita... I'm about to give up. See if he enters. It is small size. Mrs. Theodora? I'm tired of doing auditions so much. There were more than one hundred candidates. Could it be my turn? I exaggerated it, didn't I? I thought if I put on more makeup, The public would most like it. Dear... ...you have artist intuition. It is in the blood. The public has to forget that we are ordinary people, they have to see us as magical beings, touched by God. What do you think, Mr. Anatoli? Where is Mr. Anatoli? Where is Mr. Anatoli, Fonsequita? Come, my deceased. My balkan goddess. My Czech Republic wants a permanent passport. - Tell me Chechnya... - Chechnya! Shut! Very good. And in addition to miracles, Do you know how to do other arts? I do not work miracles. The faith of the people makes things happen. I do not do anything. It's okay. And what did you prepare for us? A potpourri. A what? A potpourri. A love song. I prepared a love song. I was inspired by a person. I can imagine that. We go to your act. I'm going to put a little thing on you. Ready. We will baptize it as "The Aphrodite Clown". ?Clown? Why clown? Wasn't she the maiden of the heartthrob? We have to take advantage of your talent in all potential. You can start now. Can you hold my cassette? It is just play. I think it will be better without the song. That kiss that I gave you I will never, never forget. The beautiful moon night. The moon such a vulgar witness. You are light. You are lightning, star and moon. A sunny morning. My yoyo, my yaya. My yaya, my yoyo. I gave you the sun, I gave you the sea To win your heart. You are a ray of nostalgia Meteor of passion. Explosion of feelings I could not believe. The paradita. The paradita. Hey unfaithful I want to see you living in a motel I'm throwing you out of my heart. Assume the consequences of this betrayal. Hey, Mascare?as! Great! Is that good or bad? - That's being an artist! - Then there is more. Do not! You are more than hired. The potpourri of love will be the great attraction of the international circus Eita. Fonsequita, prepare the new poster. Because Maria is going to start this weekend. Sunday? No, I can't Sunday. I will be imprisoned virgin there in the monastery. Just on Sunday that is the day we bill the most. I could assume this new position as an artist and desist from holiness, if I had a serious commitment to the heartthrob, a proper marriage... So, I promise that I will think of something. Think about it. Think of a strong idea, because my dad hates them more than anything in this world. The people of the circus. I want my mayor's belt back, To throw those people out of the canvas circus. I will start by extinguishing the Ministry of Culture. And Santita, my campaign assistant, Where is? Maria went to perform a miracle in a room a few kilometers from here, near the city. And your late girlfriend? She also went to do a charity to raise funds for the campaign. A few kilometers from the city, in a stay too. I will end that scoundrel. It's the colonel! And my dad with a gun in his hand! Notify the father and the gravedigger that they will do overtime. Balalaika! Did you hear that? It seems that there is some "problemamoviski". Come kill me with pleasure... If someone is going to die, it's me. The colonel and santita's dad are armed and very "angryvisk". Listen to me, drum. The law in this place is the barrel of my weapon! Isn't that the girlfriend? The former one? Did you also come to the audition? She is a good contortionist, But he doesn't even have half your talent. The position is yours, my daughter. It's here, in the truck, over there. As I imagined. You have 24 hours to leave the city. Did you understand. I swore that I would only leave Carit?. When I find my true love. And good... Now Anatoli needs to declare her intention to compromise and I will apologize to San Djalminha and I will forget that story of having been promised to a saint. If you are sure you have found your destination, I help you fool your dad. So I can say that he needed to keep me for one night to purify my soul before entering the cloister. Even if it was true, Is it necessary all night to disinfect the soul of a virgin? That lie is very big. By Heartthrob I go to the end of the ellipsis. Until the sun meets the moon, until you touch the navel of the world. Looks like it's time to remove that santa costume and dress yourself. Oh, Finita... I'll miss you a lot. And me? That I was born silly, I will cry. Mary! You can't imagine who came to visit you. She arrived. Good day. I came to fix our speech from today to the night at the electoral act. Electoral act? Today? Yes, today night. Or does the Santita have other plans? Well, Colonel, Mrs. Bride... Exdifunta. I have to watch for one night at the convent, I have a commitment to holiness tomorrow, Sunday. - Isn't that right, dad? - Yes, but... My motto is "first me". God comes later. By breathing the same air as the saint, I already feel lighter. Let me kiss your feet. - Needless. - If required. Now those people have love for my leg smell. Ready. Santita, you saved my girlfriend. My gratitude is awesome. If you allow me, after so many prayers and blessings, I need to retire, permission. Now are you going to tell me what you were doing in the circus with that vulgar makeup? If I return that insolent question, will you have an answer to give me? I want you to get away from that tent. At your age, Carit?? You are an old woman, used, scratched. The validity period has expired, don't you think? I tell you that I have been "gyneconded" by the church. They even gave me a guarantee certificate. Listen to me! If you reappear in that tent, I tell everyone that you didn't do any miracles! That you are a farce, Carit?! My dad and the colonel gave you the death certificate. But the shameless certificate you gave it to yourself, false. I suffer from psychic catalepsy. And is it contagious? It is a disease. What causes fainting, but then one wakes up. If the colonel finds out that I have that defect, It will return me, do you understand? And I will not return to misery, Carit?. If you want, I go to the living room and tell everyone, who is interested. That I was the chosen one to be the couple of the heartthrob. Mrs. Theodora is going to hire me, that position is mine. Come on? Why didn't you say it was to take the job of that bitch? Because you came with your finger accusing me of sinner. Look... Now that we understand each other, I will give you some advice. The colonel starts the foot of who goes against his team. He starts the tongue of those who speak ill of him. It has a very powerful agenda. So, don't leave my colonel nervous. It can be very dangerous for you and your dad. Father... You are so pale, you look like a deceased. The demagogic political pact that you will sign with me today, it's a life pact. Or death. If the colonel loses the elections, It will kill me and ruin your life. Colonel, there is a picture of me with you in every corner of this city. What else do you want? My kidneys? You will not let go of my arm until the voting ends. While I make the speech, you and your miracles will be there, did you understand? Come on. Just today that my eyes shone like Christmas lights? You can go to both places. A little with the deputy and much here in the circus. - What is the problem? - Do not... I can't risk my dad's life. It is in the hands of the colonel that is bad as the edge of the table. After the colonel wins, We Will be somewhere waiting for you. Seriously? We already sold all tickets tonight. Now it's all or nothing. I have A IDEA. The beau asks for my hand, we promise... ...and then he waits for me. But first you must prove that you are the ideal bride. The great companion of Anatoli. In and out of the sheets, I say, of the scene. It's me, Mr. Gal?n. It is the first time that I am alone with you. We Are locked up and in our future home. It is the prison that frees us, Mariuschka. Feel my heart. Late like a happy fever. So it means that you are the... "And they were happy forever". The ultimate. What is this bodice doing here? It is part of what he subtracted of the trousseau of Ingenua, now it is of its replacement. I mean, now, like my heart, This bodice belongs to you, Mariuschka. No, you don't have to kneel. I already accepted it. One day, a man has to find a lady to... - For for... It is difficult to say so. For... - For for... For for... ...get marry. Mr. Prince! I have been waiting for a real man like you for so long. A man... With the meats in place, No doubt about what you want. A crisp and perfected man. For a female like me. Watch this! Look at these teeth! What a wonder these teeth! I'm going crazy! I'll go crazy! - I'm going to take off my clothes! - No, no, wait! - Let's stop with this verse! - Calm down, my girlfriend! Town of ?rsula! On behalf of our city, my first action as mayor, it will be to ban those people from the circus. It is a bane of perdition. It will make it very clear who's in charge here! I am going to build a sanctuary for Santa Mar?a de Carit?. That he already did so many thanks to our people. He has suffered so much. You have to help me run away, Finita. My boyfriend waits for me. What will we do with those thugs? You didn't get it, it's waiting for me both ways. Two? In the tent and in bed. Take off! The time has come to deceive the town, Santita. What scarecrow is going to wear that? Your. Do you want the colonel to behead your dad? It is quite discreet. Its beautiful. And now, with you, she, who has been on the shelf, unused, no husband, kept intact! I will come back in a second. She needs relief, she is back. Finita, the monsignor and his group are arriving. My dad can't see them. My excuse for the closing will fail. And how am I going to get these people out of here? Go outside and don't let my dad see the monsignor. Our patron, sister and protector. Our favorite woman. Our saint returned. Good... She got so excited that she was speechless. And as a campaign promise, my help in the elections, my little saint, It will bring rain to these drylands! Good... It is the strength of the miracle that is in the faith of each one of you. Now, I ask you to concentrate and repeat with me. It rains, rain! It rains, rain! It rains, rain, finite... Finite. I mean, chubby... Finite... Monsignor, I have been touched. Touched? Touched by who? I received a grace from Santa Mar?a de Carit?. And I need you to come with me to the convent to Tell Mr. Monsignor what happened. Wait until Maria finishes evoking the rain. It rains, rain! It rains, rain! Santa Mar?a de Carit? is the salvation of drought. It is the salvation of Ursula! It is the salvation of humanity! I will create the Secretariat of Miracles. It's yours. Permission, Mr. Colonel, I need to retire to make my prayers. - Excuse me. - Long live Maria de Carit?! We are virtual witnesses of the miracles of santita. The file must be updated. Come on! Above it rained, now they will believe even more that I am holy. And now... ...our great musical act, the potpourri of love! We invite the bizarre, the ecumenical, the splendid clown, Aphrodite! A big applause for her! They gave me these shoes. One, two, three! Good night. I'm here to sing my potpourri. It is not to laugh. But if they want, they can laugh. I would like you to help me sing. Because I made it with all my love. And so it begins... That kiss that I gave you. I will never, never forget. The beautiful moon night. The moon such a vulgar witness. You are light. You are lightning, star and moon. A sunny morning. My yoyo, my yaya I gave you the sun, I gave you the sea To win your heart. Hey, Mascare?as! I Confess that I am confused, Mariushkas. I don't know who loves you more, if it's me or the "publicovich". The only applause I was looking for here was yours. This occasion asks for a commemoration. Unfortunately, Fonsequita called me for a meeting, then... There is no hurry, hurry I understand well. The only thing you can't do is miss our marriage. You took my words from my mouth. I already verified that I am a circus woman, now missing under the sheets... It's a bit bad, but we are going the same. As I respect you very much, my lady girlfriend, the boldness of the flesh, my "daring,". Only after the ceremony. No, mamushka? But I am very agitated. There is a lot of palpitation, a lot of dance and much sermon in the gospel. I'm catching fire! Mrs. Theodora... Could you help me with that woman and man thing? So that I can educate my parts, Prepare them for a good performance at the time of the hour. Dear... Is it really that you've never been with anyone? Until today, not a man has walked through me. I was already married. But I had no luck, I was sold by my husband. And, above, our son took away. So sad! But it is as they say: "Whenever we go out, we must take care that the world does not scam us." And I thought that sunlight would never reach my heart. Tiny and locked in my cell. But I'm getting up early in my whole body. And the sun's rays are love holding out my hand. I met the world beyond the window. God save you Mary, you are full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among all women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, Now and at the hour of our death, amen. Check it out... My boyfriend laughs alone. On Monday I will wake up being the Russian wife. Mr. Prince! Mr. Prince! Curse! This Russian owns and it's me. Maria, she... She forced me. He forced me to say goodbye to "solterovisky". Look at the ring he gave me. That you remember something? Bobita. Do you know what is the worst thing in life? It is to have been excited. I have been very donkey. An old donkey. You were born to have claustrophobia in your parts. Mary... He died! My Blessed Mother, my God! Mamushka! Mamushka! Who knows yes of that San Jos? and Santa Mar?a. Isn't a new Jesus born? Imagine if with the two now? It will be an explosion. Jos? Santo and Mar?a de Carit?, together in my campaign, Bringing together the hunger for faith. Eager to lie. Calm down, colonel. We will light one candle at a time so as not to confuse the people with so many miracles. But I want the last whole dinner to Ensure my victory in the elections. Long live Maria de Carit?! Bride of San Djalminha! The closing process of our future Santita has begun... Here is the Elixir of the virgin! We would have to bring that Jos? Santo for the campaign. We cannot put all the fruits in the same basket. I promised Jos? Santo for the presidential election. - Let me see... - Check yourself! It's spoiling everything! After today's election act, Santita will be owned by the municipality. After summoning the rain, Now more than ever, Santita is owned by the church. We know how it starts, But we don't know how it ends. I came to give myself to San Djalminha. To live in abstinence forever. And I see that not even God deserves my trust. Calm down, Maria. - It's not what you're thinking. - Do not. It is worse. Much worse. It is a lie about the other. Evil belongs to who commits it. You guessed, there is a saint in my life. But the love that comes from afar was only taken advantage of. Give me half of my money back. ...I see a love that comes from afar. See if it says "stupid" here. THE EAT SWORDS THE SNAKE WOMAN TICKET OFFICE All tickets were sold. And you choose the colonel's girlfriend. To die in your bed. But I did nothing, mamushka. Or did I kill her with pleasure? I swear if Santita disappears, I'm going to sell your skin to return the money to the crowd that came today. Where is the holy miracle? She is locked in the room praying to the saint. Forgive me, buddy, but I believe more in my eyes than in my ears. Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for us... If Santita disappeared, it will ruin my campaign. And to make matters worse, my ex-defendant girlfriend also disappeared. - Are you looking for Maria? - Yes. - And the girlfriend? - Yes. - They are in the circus. - In the circus? Sorry for the misunderstanding. That nymphomaniac almost raped our dear Anatoli. He even hinted at Fonsequita. It had the end it deserved. I promised you that I would make you a great star and that you would marry Anatoli, didn't I promise? I want you to know that I will keep my word. Thank you. The show is going to start. Do you need help with something? You can stay calm. When it's time, this clown will be ready. They are already arriving, Maria. Looks like I swallowed the world, Finita. Make your way! Go over there. Misfortune never comes alone. Watch this. You look for Santita and I to my ex-girlfriend, the future deceased! And now, with you... ...our irreplaceable clown, Aphrodite! A big applause for her! That kiss that I gave you. I will never, never forget. The beautiful moon night. The moon, such a vulgar witness Maria, what's going on? For the love of God! I want to know where my ex-girlfriend is! Future deceased! Today is Sunday, daughter. It is the day to withdraw pure and sanctified... No, dad. Today is the day of truth. And the truth is that I never did any miracles in my life. They invented all that. They invented my holiness to get vows and power, and to fool people! The only miracle I did in life was keeping me pure. Until I find my true love. And when I thought he had found me, It was all a lie about that fake Anatoli and Mrs. Theodora. It was all a circus lie. Yesterday I dreamed that they told me that faith lifts you and lack of faith throws you away. And the promise my dad made when I was born. It's the one I'm going to throw down. Because I am fed up. I'm tired of everything. I am not San Djalminha's girlfriend. I am not holy. I am not a clown. Henceforth, I am only Maria. My people, Santita is bad in the head. I came here to take her back to the path of light. - Come, Maria. - Do not touch her! Who are you to send my daughter? It does not remember me? C?cera! C?cera? C?cera is the name of my mother who died in childbirth. Does it mean you were alive all this time? He has lied. This man abandoned me more than 40 years ago. I spent my life looking for you, my daughter. You are hurting the memory of my daughter's true mother. I can try it! My daughter was born with a mark on her neck. A cross-shaped mark. If I have it! I also! And the history of difficult childbirth and that the saint saved me? I invented everything. I invented the miracle of the saint's appearance, I invented the name of the saint. I invented your promise of virginity, your commitment to the saint... I lied! - Was it a lie, bastard? - It's her fault. - You too! - Unfortunate! Is there anyone else who wants to make any revelation? I do! Santa is the whore who bore them! Are we going to make up for the time we weren't together, daughter? We will continue with this happy trade. The Aphrodite clown has a lot of talent. I spent my whole life looking for a rhyme for love. I discovered that I was not born to be a poet. Not to be a clown. Do not leave my life now. Don't be more cruel to me than destiny has already been. Mary! Mary! Where do you think you are going? Life is calling me, Finita. Did you leave without saying goodbye? I am in a hurry to start. You don't know who is looking for you... Jos? Santo, that one in the file. The one who was scammed by the colonel and monsignor. Yes? But now my route is long... ...but it is narrow. I can go with you? Finite... ...from today, Take care of it for me. My dear San Antonio... And he is quite pretty. Could you give me some joy in the parties. But he was late, poor thing. Now that I uncovered everything, I already removed the cap, I will not be imprisoned, handcuffed to one soul. No way. Now I am more ahead. Now I want to be strengthened, feminized, empowered, bloody! And I will discover what the world wants from me. And what do I want from the world. And I keep persevering in faith, but in a prettier faith yet. Faith in oneself. END
