OKO Film Studio and Polish Television Present BACHELOR LIFE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY Screenplay based on the book by Jakub Wojciechowski. Production Designer Interior Designer Costume Designer Make up Editing Sound Music Starring Production Manager Cinematography Directed by Get rid of that knife, or the Germans will laugh at you! It’s the only knife I've got. You have to get a new one. First I have to earn some money. Do you speak German? Yes, I’m from near Poznań. July the 3rd is the anniversary of…? Battle of Königgrätz. How do you know that? I did go to school. We’re in Germany now. There is no God here. Or fasting. I signed up for dancing classes. One needs to bring a girl to dance with. No. I don’t have a pair either. We must remember that a proper curtsy is the best display of human decency. Now, you’ll curtsy and I’ll point out your mistakes. Too emotionless. Your legs aren’t evenly placed. Pursed lips. Don’t bend your knees. Look in the eyes. Facial expression should be cheerful and pleasant. A gentleman inviting a lady to dance approaches her, curtsies to her beautifully and expresses his wish in a kind and gentle manner. May I be as bold as to ask if I could have the pleasure of dancing with you? - Could I have the pleasure… - No, look in the eyes. Right, in the eyes. Again. Could I have the pleasure of dancing with you? - Good. - My turn. They need you there like they need a hole in the head. You don’t… Whatever. Tomfoolery… Could I have the pleasure of dancing with you? Don’t look at your feet, memorize the steps. Move from your hip! The man is leading, imposing his will. Legs straight but not stiff. Michał, show us what you’ve learned. I can teach you better things. Would you like me to? This will be of better use to you. Don’t listen to her. We’ll go to the medical exhibition. They will show us everything for just a mark. What can she know? She’s only pretending to be smart. Our exhibition presents different maladies. Here are male and female illnesses. Such as syphilis, chancres, burned shafts, dose and other infectious maladies. They’re all to be contracted in the frenzy of animal lustfulness. And these are the pictures, showing gentlemen and ladies who suffered from those illnesses. You will know by the lady’s face that she isn’t healthy. These are various human insides. One always has to take a very good look at a girl. If she looks pale, it’s always better to assume that she is ill. Right… Here we have skulls, veins, and nerves of a human being. As the finale to our dancing course we’ll show to parents and invited guests, what you learned. Now, gentlemen, introduce yourselves to the parents of the ladies you were dancing with, and invite the lady to dance. I don’t think I can do it. I can’t utter a single word. I think I can manage introducing myself to her parents. This teacher emboldened me so that I’m hardly afraid. Could I have the pleasure of dancing with you? May I be as bold as to ask, if I could have the pleasure of dancing with you? This is the proper way to do it. Not that you’d know. May I be as bold as to ask… If you did go to a dance, you’d bring shame to your girl. What? Me? Nothing you do is allowed. Standing with your arms akimbo, stumping your feet, clasping your hands… Leaning against the wall and the door. - Anything else? - Just that the likes of you should sit on their asses at home and not bring shame to Poland. Shame, huh? To Poland? Sit on… I’ll give you shame… You! - Good day! - Stop! - Good day! - I thought it was the Gypsies. My name is Schumman. I used to be a lion tamer. When I don’t travel, I dwell in Hannover. Would you like to take me with you? I would. We need help with the carousel. Could you use two helpers? No, we only need one. Go. I wouldn’t go anyway. I’ve recently started… feeling pain… in my joints. But you go with them, Michał. Herman, can you hear that? It’s our boss. With his wife? She’s not so much his wife as his landlady. And he uses her as he pleases. He has a new one every week. Michał, you and Herman will switch places every two hours, so neither of you feels more used than the other. Look: heads - up, tails - down. It says here that this place has several factories. They make various kinds of paint. Ammonia, Aulin… There’s a factory making special medical products, one for pots and one for pottery. Let’s go and see it tomorrow. - We’re going to the girls tomorrow. - I’m not, for I can’t be certain about them. You’re daft. I fooled around with the girl from the shooting range. I took her so hard standing up, that my knees were shaking. Standing up? It’s nothing unusual among us, Germans. - You paid a thaler? - No, two marks. Had you given her three, she would have lied down for you. Your knees wouldn’t shake. It’s not very wise to get it on with a girl you don’t know. - Let go! - It’ll be fine that way. Like dogs. I don’t want to. So get out. Get out. Better asses than yours are in abundance here. I’ll get a new one tomorrow! Get out of here! Out! Michał! The great Count von Greisenau has a palace not far from here. He’s employing hundreds of girls from your country. Go and convince one of them. I can’t make love to any girl for... if anything happens, she’ll be disgraced and I’m in no position to marry yet. That’s why I have to keep them away. If all girls thought like that, none would even look at a man. Michał! Yes? Life without making love is against nature. You just have to find one, who knows how to play it safe. Couldn’t you bring one of your countrywomen here? No, they’re not like local girls. They’re not brave enough, to go with a man. I feel sorry for them. You, Germans, at least work from dawn till dusk. You eat well and make a nice living. And we, Poles, are like Gypsies, constantly wandering around the world. But they take the same interest in those things as we do. Do you know why? Why? For there is no difference between the man and the beast. You have to remember, that it’s just nature. And that it governs everything. For instance, during labor, a woman is in such great pain that she swears she’ll never lie with a man again. But weeks pass, and nature calls, so she forgets everything and wants to be with a man once again. Where are you off to, you two? You want to burn your shafts? Whatever… Come, let’s go see the girls. Didn’t you hear what the boss said? He has a girl anytime he wants. We better go to the zoo. We can have a beer there, and the music’s playing. Music… Beer… We’re going to see the girls. I’ll show you! Don’t protest! We’re going! Only the rich gentlemen come here. There are so many pretty girls here. They’re like wax figures. One prettier than the next. They circle around those gentlemen to keep them company. I see how those noble gentlemen live and I think that God chose well to create the rich and the poor but the disparity between them is just too great. Come, let’s look for different girls. Equally pretty. See how pretty they are? Pretty but white as ghosts. You want to go see them? They’re… so pale. Come to me. They aren’t healthy. One thing to remember. If they want to give you beer, tell them you don’t feel like it. What? I’ll tell you why you don’t want to go. Firstly, you’re a coward. And secondly, you want to keep the thaler. So pretty. I’d rather go and see the pottery factory. I’d rather be with the girls. Michał, come down. Can you stay down here for the rest of the day? I can’t bend over. Michał! Herman doesn’t want to switch? No. He must have burned his shaft. It can’t be anything else. Are you trying to heal yourself? I got some mercury ointment. Show me what the pain looks like. Not quite what I expected. Go to see a doctor before you make it worse. If I go to the doctor, he’ll send me to the sick house. Michał! Michał! Get Herman’s trunk and take it to the sick house. Herman’s pain got me so terrified, that I can’t even look at a girl. Back in the army, a doctor discovered one of us had a burnt shaft. He tells him to get up on a stool and turns to us: “Look, boys, what a burned shaft looks like”. And that if he came clean earlier it wouldn’t have gotten so bad. I’m going to town to find a replacement for Herman. Give me a spoon. Wifey brought you lunch? I wouldn’t let such a pretty lady go without having my way with her. To have her for just one night… If you had, you’d sing a different tune, boss. Willi, tell me, why don’t you like it when we talk about girls? And why do you complain about your wife? Because she’s unfaithful. Come have a beer with me and I will tell you about my sorrow. She’s off to see the soldiers again. Can’t you forbid her to go? My wife has one reply to anything I say: “Take me hard so I feel spent and I won’t look around for others.” You have such a pretty lady. Isn’t there a way to make peace with her? For your wife is as pretty as those girls, who are chosen to play in theaters. We have a house, and furniture so lovely that it glistens. Everything’s so clean, you won’t find the tiniest speckle. How is it possible? My little mind can’t comprehend it. Why can’t you come to an agreement? When we make love, she always tells me, it isn’t enough. And that I have to give her more, instead of being lazy. Get out! Get out of here! Such asses are all around! I’ll find a better one! Michał! Wilhelm… He didn’t feel like working, so he hanged himself. Go there and cut him down. Quite an advertisement he made us, son of a bitch. There’s nothing left but to pack up and go. Ms Luther? Yes. I was told I can rent a room here. - With laundry and board? - Yes. Twelve marks. Not long ago I was married but I didn’t agree with my husband. So we went our separate ways. And now I’m divorced. The only advantage is that my former husband now has to give me money. I will... pay for a month in advance. This can wait. What’s paid, can’t be forgotten. Good morning, Mr Schulz. - What’s your name? - Michał. One of your countrymen worked here before. He had sticky hands. When he got them on a watch he couldn’t put it down. You can steal, too? No. Then you can work here. Just don’t do what your countryman did. You’re to come to my bed tonight. You have as far to my bed as I do to yours. Good night. Move. I haven’t had an opportunity to sleep with someone for so long. So? Shall we start? While you’re still in your pants? Just a moment. This feels uncomfortable. Wait. Wait. I’ll find the right position. Now, you can get closer. What is it? What’s wrong? Something hurts? - What? - Should I stop? Silly boy. Harder. Now I’ve had enough. I’ll be braver next time. Good morning! Don’t you feel like it? Not till Thursday. My time takes six, seven days. I read once, that for a healthy lady it doesn’t take more than three. Every nature is different. Just don’t leave the house. Is this your wallet? Not mine. Is this yours? No. Not mine, either. Maybe it’s master Schulz’s? Did you lose something, boss? Michał found a wallet. I lost it. - What are you reading? - A book. “Happiness in Love Is the Greatest Happiness on Earth.” Tonight, we’ll sleep together. Very well, but you have to be the responsible one. Get to bed! Tonight, you’ll be on the bottom and I’ll get on top. Me? On the bottom? Can we do that? I don’t think it’ll work. You know how to press on me hard. Get closer, so you really are in the mood for love. This book shows 21 ways of how a man and a woman should get close together. We’ve only tried three. Four. Three. Four. So we still have seventeen to go. We do! Mr Schulz! Mr Schulz! Was someone here? Just me. You did well. If it wasn’t for you the boiler would burst and the factory would blow up. A Pole… and yet he did a great job. That’s what I wanted to hear. Now you will know, boss, that Poles aren’t halfwits. Or thieves! I’m leaving. Like hell you are. I don’t believe it. I don’t like my job here. I’m leaving, so I can look for luck in Westphalia. It’s a dangerous place. Not even a bird will survive there. That doesn’t matter. I’m leaving. So now you have to get really close to me. We’ve been going at it the whole night. Isn’t that too much to ask from a single man? My nature must want it badly. May I have this dance? Don’t! Leave her! Let go of me! In Saxony and Mecklenburg, there are hundreds of girls willing to have a boy. And here there are few. If one comes to visit her relatives, she’s already spoken for and gets married. The boys just can’t talk to each other. One time, they got in such a brawl that they tore their custom made clothes to rugs. There wouldn’t be a girl left for me. - Why? - I don’t have the looks. And there are hundreds of handsome boys, who all desire a Polish girl. I don’t intend to fight against my nature. Darling boy, come with me. Only two marks. Come with me. You don’t want to come with me? To burn my shaft? I get checkups. Here is my health card. So? Will we be one? - Fine. - Let’s go. We know all the nooks and crannies. It’ll be two marks. Let’s start. But… Go on. Can it be done this way? We’re in Westphalia, not Prussia. Go on. Get closer! Let me grab that shaft of yours. It’s my first time Westphalia style. Sakraten. My nature demanded that I became one with a girl. And this girl was dirty with little insects, which we call “sakraten”. Do tell me, what’s good for it. I’ll give you some grey ointment and it will take care of them in no time. You could have ended up with a different malady. Where did you get those insects? On Kamelstrasse. When your nature demands it again, you’re to go to Nobenstrasse. Remember. You’ll pay a little more, but you’ll be spared misadventures like this one. They have a great service and the best selection in all of Germany. Last night I had a dream about a beautiful girl. Such dreams come to you for you have too much fire within. And it gets relieved in your dreams. You ought to see a girl and get clean there. You’re all adults. And yet none of you had anything to do with the fairer sex. Where will we find a girl to satiate our urges? There are hundreds who are regularly examined by a doctor. And their purpose is to let everyone satiate their needs. So urges of their nature are fulfilled. Just look at Franek. Look at the pimples spilling out on his face! And then look at a married man, like our landlord. You won’t see any pimples on his face. Why? For he has a lady. We have such a pretty landlady. Time for bed. Michał is right. Those pimples are nothing but lust spilling out. True! All right. Let’s stop. I’ll give you… I’ll give you some instructions. Those girls will take your shafts in their hands to make sure you are not infected. That’s their duty. They have to protect themselves so they don’t catch it. They see a doctor every few days. Second thing… Don’t get too friendly with them. If they offer you beer, tell them you don’t feel like it. And lastly, it’s the largest selection in Germany. You choose one out of ten. - I don’t want to. - Don’t worry, they will choose you. Good morning! Truda, Anna, Hilda! Gentlemen are here who want to be serviced. Leave him! Go away! I have to check if you’re not infected. I can see you like me. Come here. Satisfied? Hey! Stop! Didn’t the foreman tell you not to go in there after the explosion? You’re not old enough to be talking to others. You dig your own grave. You forgot point 18 in the rulebook? It says, that we have to wait for the smoke to disperse. Why is this fool so wise all of a sudden? That’s good, Michał, that you’re so interested in these things. You’ll make a great miner. No, sir. Being a miner is the saddest job in this God’s world. They work in stink, in heat, they sweat and eat dust. But the money is better than anywhere else. I don’t want the money. I don’t want to waste my life on such a job. You’ll be a cutter sooner than you think. - I won’t. - We’ll see. Stella, Viola, Gabi! Gentlemen are here who want to be serviced. Satisfied? You didn’t show me any love. You were lying there like you were dead. At least my lust has slackened somewhat. Get back here and I’ll wash your shaft. I don’t want to. Your friends always pay more to their girls. You know what? It’s quite a lot of money for such a short while. If everyone wanted it like you, I would never break even. Well… Next customers. I have a feeling that those girls squeezed way more than a thaler out of you. No! We’ve only paid them a thaler each and that’s that. But I know that’s why they kept you there so long. But I did give you good advice about those pimples. A couple of visits with the girls, and all the pimples are gone. You didn’t have to buy ointments or other lotions. So? Was Michał right? Such mature gents like you can’t deny their nature. Michał! Get up, fast! Things got hairy! The ladies found out we go to visit the girls and are now making all sorts of fuss. We are not brave enough to talk to those ladies. Michał, you’re prepared for it. Go and tell them. Come! Faster! Dear ladies! Why are you so jealous? We are all mature men. We don’t envy you all that fornicating. When your men are back from work, you spread your legs and tell them to get in. You don’t ask whether they have a passion for it or not. Did you see us do it? Did you hear us? Everyone should get married first. And talk later. I did see and I did hear. Not once and not twice. Only last year 23 thousand men got a divorce. And as a reason stated that they weren’t satisfied. 5 thousand lost their minds for they didn’t have an opportunity to get close to the female person. You counted them that you know so well? We will talk some more! Michał, come in! You should let your landlady earn some money instead of visiting girls. All very well but if you betray me things can get unpleasant. I can even be taken to court. - Don’t be silly… - For breaking the marriage law. You silly, you. I won’t tell anyone. You’re joking. Or are you being honest? What do you think? Do get ready. Mr foreman, how do these chutes work that are to replace the trolleys? Michał is always asking something. I’m curious and I want to understand everything where I’m employed. Lukan, Dolow, look! All the years you’ve been working here, you’ve never asked anything. And he already wants to know everything. I will explain it all to you. You’re not going to explain things to a Pole, are you? I forbid you to talk like that. You can be a wise guy where you come from but not here. You come here and our wages get lower. Not only those folks from Poznań but the entirety of Galicia is here. Go complain to Bismarck and his politics. And if you call me a stupid Pole again, I’ll knock your teeth out. What? What did you say? Shut your mouth, you… - …lousy Pole. - Hey, Dolow! Michał! Michał, we’re going to see the girls tomorrow. Count me out. What’s wrong? Nothing, it’s just… You can’t get a lot of love from a girl who gives herself for money. I have to go to see them for my nature calls me. And you said yourself that one shouldn’t fight nature. You know what, we should try to meet normal girls instead of visiting those who spread their legs for money. Hell, it’s all the fault of the Polish nobility. They didn’t care about Poland, they were just whoring around Warsaw and Paris. Their wives weren’t enough so they went to France to cool off. And now we must repent for their deeds with our shafts stiff in a foreign country. How’s the water? Not too cold? What are you doing? Can’t we wash ourselves? The landlady always has to wash her guests’ backs. That’s the custom here. - Can you dance? - Yes. Would you like us to go and dance together? Yes. Buy me something nice. Pay for it. And you’ll come to my place? - What about panties? - No, no. What is it? No great love will happen while you’re wearing panties. I’ll take them off myself. What? You’re not brave enough? Now I will get so close to you, that you will forget to fight me. No! What is it? What’s in there? You were never that close to a male person before? I want to. - But I’m afraid. - No need to be afraid. Nature demanded this from you. And nature can’t be denied. I’m scared. Great desire took over me today. - We can go to your place. - Sure. What do I have to buy you first? - Something nice. - Oh, no. You keep forcing me to buy you things. I’ve wasted so much time and money on you. And the way you ask makes a man give up his soul. But when push comes to shove you give nothing in return. You just say you’re scared. I’ve had enough. That one is rich. - Which one? - Dark haired one. This one? She’s exactly what I need. They say she has a furnished house. Her name is Regina. She’s pretty. And rich. That’s all I need. I like the other one. Johanna. See? The furniture is nice. And there is a double bed covered with a plush throw. We have a lot of china. See how lovely that cup is? We have plenty of linens. And we also have some money. It will all be yours when you marry Regina. You’ll see, that you won’t regret marrying her. I got it on with Johanna three times yesterday. It was amazing. So amazing, that my head was spinning. Such a woman must have a lot of boys. One will never fulfill her. I think… I’m getting married. To Regina. Michał, if you want to get somewhere in life, you better stop seeing her. You want to marry a German girl? You’ll never be happy. You’re Catholic, she’s Protestant. Such marriages are often unhappy. You’re silly, it’s not what that’s about. This Regina was so lustful that she just kept chasing boys. She did it for so long that finally, they broke her. And now she’s wearing a special belt. Just don’t tell anyone I told you. I won’t. But I’ll check for myself if that’s true. No one else can see us but God alone. Give it a rest. No one will buy a pig in a poke. Be honest, don’t you have love for the male person? Are you not capable of loving at all? First you have to marry. Then it’ll be time for love. I’ve had enough. It’s the last time I’m talking to you. I didn’t think you were so phony. If you can’t be with a man, you don’t have to make a fool out of me. I wish you luck. I think that you wanted to force yourself upon my daughter. I wanted to take her, for that is my duty. I wanted to see if what people are saying is true. That your daughter can’t be with a man. No one is stupid enough to buy a pig in a poke. It was your duty to tell me everything about it. You are God-fearing, you go to church every day, and yet you’re double tongued like vipers… And so is your daughter. I only wish, I hadn’t lost all that honor. And I am sure you wanted to force yourself upon her and you’ll answer for it! Six marks. Fine. - Hello! - Herman, hi! - Good morning. - He’s a friend. I don’t have a job. I’m a pimp. I take care of those who spread their legs before everyone. I watch over those girls. And if someone refuses to pay, I can thump them with a stick. Just wait. Give it two days and you’ll be hooked. I’ll have an urgent matter to attend to. She wants my shaft in her chimney. I’ll get 10 marks for it. I don’t know how can you feel love for such a dame. It’s just business. No, I don’t think I could make a living in such a way. That’s ‘cause you’re daft. Lovely to see you. - We’re going. - We’re going! Finally! Hurry up, the tram is coming! Don’t you worry. We made it. New conductor. - Here. - That’s how it all went. - I can’t believe it. - You’re joking! She must work here somewhere. Really? So we must ask someone. Where do you think you’re going? To look for love. I already found mine but maybe we could find someone for him, too? We probably could. I’m not looking for a girl, who only wants to fool around. But she should be lenient. There is one who dresses in… She must be working here. She had such a nice collar. A lot of Polish girls work here. One prettier than the other. But you have to come on a different day than Sunday. Why are you crying? I wanted to stop working at the factory and leave all the things in order. But our inspector kept my last payment. And said it was for a gift, we all got at the factory for Christmas. We shall go to that inspector. What’s your name? - Agata. - I’m Michał. Is this him? I believe that what was once given, cannot be taken away. You are wrong. The law clearly states that employer can keep the gift, or money equivalent for the said gift. You can’t protest against that. But if she decides to come back to work, I’ll make sure she gets paid everything we owe her. Are you her man? I am. Michał… Yes? Did you… Did you and Agata… Did you become one already? I did not force her to give me love. And I received no love from her. There’ll be time for that. I see you have plans for her. I think I do. Józia and I are going back to Poland. It’s easy to forget your prayers and your mother tongue when you live abroad. You can be Polish even if you live somewhere else in the world. Yes… Well… May God be with you. And now… What is that? Society of Trams, something, something… To the substitute conductor no. 1292. “We are happy to inform you that as of next month you are employed as a tram driver with a monthly salary of 110 marks. And included in our pension fund for the Society of Trams’ employees.” Hey, you! Your Agata and other Polish girls got lashes for not wanting to go to work. They said it was Catholic holiday. Who hit Agata? - The inspector did. - Where is he? In his office. Police! Police! Police! You can.. consider it. If... If you want to be with me... you know that I have no money… You can write to me, or you can answer me now. Wait for my message. And if... you find some other happiness… Don’t tread all over it. 500 marks for a miner who sent the highest number of trolleys to the surface. You are the lucky one. - Thank you. - My respects to you. Now my beloved can come and join me. And this is how great happiness ended my journey through the wilderness of love.
