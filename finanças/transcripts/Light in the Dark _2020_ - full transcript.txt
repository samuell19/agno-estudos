Mummy, what else? What am I going to eat tonight? This is not fair. When I'm at work, don't you eat? But you are not going to work. You are going to Igboland. But I'll still be here in Nigeria. You might as well be in Egypt. Why can't you find a nice Yoruba boy, huh? You're beautiful and the money is there. Wasting all of it on some Igbo child. We've talked about this enough. Mummy, I need to go so I don't miss my flight. Mama. Hm! Hm! Hello. Ify? Your mom? Yes. This woman, she's being such a pain, you know? "Don't eat outside! Don't stay out too late." Please mom, oh! She's just concerned you're traveling east of the Niger, that's all. She's going on as if I'm going to another planet. She's the older generation, you have to remember that. Speaking of which, how's your mom? My mom cannot wait to see you. Oh, yes. Same here. And you should taste her cooking. Are you serious? I am so famished. Oh, yeah. And here's the last lap into the road that leads to our street. Aha! Almost there. Ah, come in. Mama, this is Jumoke. Welcome! Ah, Emeka, Mama Yes, I came visiting with my girlfriend. Oh, welcome my sister. Thank you. I'm Ifeoma. Welcome. Thank you. So that's the famous Ifeoma. Yeah, that's her. Do I sense some sort of insecurity? Shouldn't I be? I mean, you've known her all your life and you guys dated for years and it's obvious your mom still adores her, so... You know I adore you? Why don't you leave this on one side and let's celebrate east meeting west. Hey babe, were are you going? I have to help your mom clean or something. Haba, come back here jor. - Sweetheart. - I did not bring you here to clean. - Are you sure? - It's okay. I don't want to get into trouble with your mom. Just stay, jor, it's not my mom. Are you sure? Hm, I'm sure. You're not going anywhere. What are you doing? Good morning ma, I'm sweeping. Uh-uh, by this time? Is that the time you sweep in your house? I'm sorry, Ma. Anyway, Ifeoma swept here an hour ago, hm? You better find something else to do and make yourself useful, if you can. Maybe the east meeting the west isn't such a good idea. It is a great idea. Are we in the same house? Jumoke, bringing you here to meet my mom is only part of the reason I brought you here. You can't be serious, Emeka. Your mom doesn't like me. My mom may not like you, but she has to accept you because I love you. I love you. I will stand with you. I will protect you. So if you're going to say yes or no, let it come straight from your heart and not because of what anyone thinks. Yes, I'll marry you. Yes! Kagbim. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about, woo! Oh my God! - My wife to be. - Oh! It's so beautiful. Come here. I know it's scary but... Ow! Oh, my back, my back, my back, my back. What have I done to you? Well, she's your daughter. There goes our horror movie, so which one now? I know. What do you wanna watch? Dora? There goes Mummy and Daddy's time. - Fine. - Which one? Fine, fine. Jumoke, did you hear what I said? That my hormone levels have improved? Yes! Really improved. You're ovulating? Yes, yes, I am. Started today. You should be more excited. The more excited I am doctor, the more disappointed I'll be if I don't get pregnant, so... Have faith this time. It looks really good. Sorry baby, I got lost in work. Tell me something new. So what did the doctor say? The results are good and she's hopeful. Hm! So that means I can't go out with the boys for booze tonight? Wait! So if we weren't doing this, you would leave me alone at home with your mother? Haba now! It's not that bad. Besides, she's only staying with us one more night. And not a moment too soon either. Only God knows what she would have done to me if I didn't have Adaeze. She would not have done anything to you. Look, I love you. I will stand with you. I will protect you. Aw! I know, honey, I know. Look, I have to go. I'm having lunch with Amina. Amina again! Come, you and this newfound sister of yours, eh? It's not enough that you're meeting at the house all the time? The poor woman needs to get out and away from that loud-mouth husband of hers, you know? Once in a while. All right, I'll see you later, yeah? Okay, bye. Amina! Hey! Hi, how are you? Good to see you. Thank you. I'm so sorry, I kept you. It's okay, you're the big banker. I know you're busy. Yeah, right, please. So, tell me, what, what did you and Sadiq agree on? Sadiq? That one! He will just talk and talk and that will be it. No action. I've decided to make a move on my own. That's good. That's very good. Thank you. So um, what kind of business are you looking to do? I mean what sort of things are you passionate about? Ah, I'm passionate about... I'm, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. - I have to take this. It's important. Yeah, hello? Has the money come in now? But you said we would have a bank guarantee to cover the three million dollars. Mom! Hello. Hello. Good evening, Ma. Mummy? Yes? Grandma was telling me stories about the civil war. Really? Yes. How grandpa won many battles. Wow! That's nice. Now take these things to the room for me. Be careful. And then come back and tell me everything you learned in school today. Okay? Mwah! Mummy, how are you? How have you been? How will they give me a grandson when they are always going out? Why? Ha! Mummy, I have a career too. Besides, it's not even like Emeka is at home. I'm not going to make a baby by myself. Uh, uh! Leave my son out of this. You know what to do. And give me a grandson! Daddy, smile for the camera. You shouldn't be playing with that thing so much, it's not our own. Ha! Amina, let my son play now. What do you mean let him play? Look Ahmed, it's past your bedtime. Go to bed. And don't forget to turn that camera off. Goodnight Daddy, goodnight, Mummy. So I had lunch with Jumoke today. Why? What do you mean why? Why would you go and eat outside when there is food here? Because I want to do more with my life than just cook and carry Ahmed around. Amina, I have plans- - Ah! "I have plans, I have plans." Four years now! Four years and I have not done my NYSE. "I'll start you a business. I'll start you a business." All talk, talk, no action. Amina! Take it easy now. Don't worry. By the time I am done with tomorrow's business, you will see action. Hey, hey. Action! Hai! Baby, I'm in trouble. I can explain. Look, I, I was delayed by a client review... Shh. The next few days are very crucial. Hmm. Jumi, have you been drinking wine? Wine? I'm not crazy. I've been drinking mineral-enriched water. Mh. Okay, let me go and check on Adaeze. I'm coming back now. Adaeze is fine. Right now I need you to concentrate on giving her a brother. Hm, or maybe a sister? There's no or in this matter, Emeka. It's your business. There you go! Mwah! What? You don't want to talk to mummy or what? So, so, so sorry for keeping the most important women in my life waiting. Hi darling. Mwah! Right. Has your mom landed? Yes, she called to say she landed safely hours ago. Of course, it's you she'll call. I mean, all I did was just take her to the airport and just check her in. Come on, baby. You know my mom loves you. She does? She has a strange way of showing it. Anyway, babe, look, you have to try and come home earlier. Yeah, sure. I have a new client I am seeing today. How about you? What plans do you have for the rest of the day? I'm just following up on a 3 million-dollar transaction that I'm processing and I'll be done. Okay, that's good, I... Baby, I need to go. Okay, bye darling. So it's you? When you guys insisted on me, I thought I was in for a very, very difficult client. Come on. I'm to liaise with your company. So when I saw that you were a partner there, I knew I would be best in your hands. Wow! How long has it been? Eight, nine years? I last saw you at your wedding, 11 years ago. Wow! It has been a very long time. It sure has. So how about you? How are you doing? Are you married now? Well, let's just say I'm looking for the right man. Hm. Hm. Be careful, oh! Be careful, my daughter will fall. Ah... Enjoyed your ride, didn't you? - Oh! - Sorry! You don't know you're old. You will be doing horse. At this rate, how will we be able to get children? Why would I listen to you? You don't be a man in this family! - I am trying my best! - You don't do anything you're supposed to do. Your best is not good enough. Not good enough, Sadiq. Not good enough. I can't take this. Ahmed. What are you doing? You're recording me? Okay. Carry on. Who is it? Who's there? Madam, na one big man dey look for oga. Uh Ahmed, please open the door. Ah, ah. Who is that? Who is that? Na one big man find oga come. Ah, ah, at this time of the night. Tell him I'm sleeping. Open the door, Mr. Emeka. Who is that? You have till the count of five to open this door, or I will shoot your gateman, force my way in and kill everyone in that house. One! Hold on. Hold on, please, hold on. Jumoke. Jumoke! Jumoke! Get up! Get up! Go inside Adaeze's room and lock yourself in. What happened? Armed robbers are here right now. Don't say a word. Don't open the door. Fast. Four, five. Wait, wait, I'm here. I'm here. You can K., I've tied up the gentleman. Keep watching outside. The house is empty but there's only one room I couldn't get into. Look, you guys have everything you want now. What, what more do you want? What about your wife's gold? And by the way, where is Mrs. Emeka, for that matter? Actually she, she, she, she, she traveled with my daughter and my mother to the east just this morning. And what is behind the locked door? Actually, my mother, when, when she traveled to the east, she mistakenly took the key with her. I can't even get to the room myself. Oh, really! So my boy can spray the room with bullets, right? You! Hey! Wait, wait, wait. I'll take you myself. Jumoke. Have they gone? Come out. Leave Adaeze and come out. Just come out, please. That's everything. Oh! Not quite. What is it? I am going to enjoy some of what Mr. Emeka enjoys. Watch it! - No, no! - No, over my dead body! All right, it can be arranged. Before we do that, should I go and bring Adaeze and you watch my men have turns on her? You are an animal! An animal! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I gave you an option. Your wife or your daughter? Which one? Please, please, don't do this to me. Please. Please. No! No! No! No! Please leave my daughter alone. Please. Just please. Leave my daughter alone. All right. You have to make this worthwhile. If I don't enjoy it, I'll still have to get your daughter. No! No! Please, I'll do anything you, you, want. Just leave my daughter alone. Please. You said they addressed their leader as K.? Did you get a good look at his face? No. All right, I'll check if his name is associated with one of the gangs we are already trailing. Dad, what are the police doing in our house? Adaeze, come, come, come. Inspector, can we do this some other time? I think we've had enough for tonight. For now. I'll leave one of my men here for the next few days. Okay? And, um, I suggest you go to the hospital and get some rest. I'll be in touch. Good night. Is there something I can help you with? Mummy, can I still go to Rita's house? Come, Adaeze. Mummy needs to rest. I'll take you myself. We thank God. So how are Adaeze and Jumoke? Adaeze slept through it all. She did not stir. Jumoke. Jumoke is still recovering. Is that all they did to her? Yes. Apart from the jewelry that they took. You know these people, they can be savages. Were they savage to you? Hm? My wife? - No! - Never! Never! Those bastards? They tried to be funny with Amina. But I made sure that it's over my dead body. I never let it happen. Never! I did everything to make sure it never happened. You seem clear of any infections. Did you check everything? There's only so much you can pick up from a toilet, you know? I know. I just want a comprehensive check-up, doctor. That's what I ordered. You really are all clear. Jumoke, where did you go? Out. Out? I've been looking for you all day. Jumoke? Don't! Would you like to go to the hospital, you know, maybe talk to someone about it? And tell them what, exactly? That my husband can't protect me? Ah, Jumoke! Jumoke, that's not fair now. But it is the truth, Emeka. Okay, where are you going now? Mom? My sunshine. Are you okay? Mom, no breakfast yesterday. None again today. Sweetheart, sit. But I gave you money to buy something in school. It's not about food. It's about us being together. That's what you told me. I know. I know that's what I told you but, my darling, I don't know when that is going to happen again. But why? I liked it. You see, we don't get to do whatever we like all the time. But I want you to know that Mummy and Daddy love you very much. Okay? Something happened but everything is fine now. Jumoke, what happened? I haven't been able to reach you for a couple of days. Robbers. Robbers came to the house. Yoh! I warned you. Be careful with these people, huh? Only God knows who your husband offended that robbers came for him. Mummy, we don't know why it happened. But I will be fine. These Igbo boys, they are no good. Ibadan. Igbo boy are dangerous at night. And in the day, too. Oh! Good morning, Ma. Amen, Ma. Hm, God help us. So, how were you able to call our helpline? Well, Inspector, I actually have a spare phone. So as soon as I was able to untie myself, I quickly made that phone call. You didn't report anything stolen? We don't have much. Yeah, Inspector, there's nothing here. I mean, I just bought the place, you know, so we're still trying to move things inside. I see. They addressed you by name? Do you have any issues with anyone that would make them want to threaten you? No! No, no, not me. No, no, no. I, I have made peace with everyone. I am at peace with everyone. I guarantee you. Maybe my security man, maybe gave my name away. You know it's a possibility. I'm not saying that he's directly involved, you know, but a name is not hard to come by, you know. Inspector, do you think you can catch them? I hope so. We have spoken to your security man and we are confident he's not and accomplice. Were you speaking to him or were you torturing him? The new Inspector-General doesn't condone any violation of human rights. That's news to me. Look, the police are getting better and more professional. Okay? A three-man gang fitting the vague description you gave have been acting as enforcers and loan sharks. Do you have any large debts? No, we don't. Well, all this can't come cheap. No, it's not, but we can afford it. We work very hard for our money and we are paid very well as a result. What of Mrs. Arinze here? Bankers deal with large amounts of money. Is there anyone that you've cheated or disappointed recently? Inspector, I'll not have that from you. It's just a question. No. I have not cheated or disappointed anyone recently. Ooh! Fans of Kano Pillars. Ooh! Let's go and see Emeka and Jumoke. Ah, Amina why now? Kai, you can see there is a game of Kano Pillars. Are you serious? But we need to go and check on them again after the robbery. Oh, Amina, remember now. Is it not the same robbers that came here and robbed us? Ah-ah, is it my fault that Emeka cannot take care of his family? Haba! Sadiq! That's too mean. Too mean, hm! Sorry, so sorry. Your husband said they hit you. What can we do? And all your jewelry? It must have been worth millions. Those can be replaced, Amina. Really? Just like that? They're just gold. Money can always buy gold. Ah, good afternoon, Ma. Amina Yes, Ma. Get up, my dear. Thank you, Ma. Thank you, thank you. Mummy? You're going? You said you're fine that I should be going. This is my best friend, Boots. We're going to the big... How long are you going to keep giving me the silent treatment? You know you can't move permanently into Adaeze's room. You're right. Mum, why did we have to come to Grandma's house? Daddy needs to do some work in the house. And we'll be disturbing him if we stay there. So will Daddy be alone in the new house? Yeah, but just for a short while. And in the meantime, we'll keep grandma company. Is that okay? Mh? Emeka? Sadiq. How are you? I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's nothing, I just wanted to return this. Oh, okay. Ahmed has not been feeling much of a cameraman, you know, in recent times, after all that's happening, so... Would you blame him? I don't blame him at all. He's a young man, I mean. But thanks very much. - It's okay. - Thank you. Do you know that he was the one who opened the door for those armed robbers? Thank God I was able to control the situation. If not, I don't know what would have happened, you know. Ah, ah I didn't hear you come up, Mom. Ah, all this time, I have asked you to stay over with your family. Hmm! It takes a few incidents with a stranger for my daughter and granddaughter to sleep over. Gloat all you want, Mom, I don't care. I will gloat. But jokes apart, do you really think it is fair to leave Emeka in that house on his own? He's a grown man. He will be fine. Emeka! We were supposed to have a meeting an hour ago. You are not picking up your phone. Yeah. Sorry, I didn't hear you. Um, the meeting completely escaped my mind. I'm not sure where I left my phone, sorry. What is going on? Nothing, nothing. Ah, ah-ah. Emeka, this is me. Tell me what the problem is. Come on! Oh my God! How are Adaeze and Jumoke taking it? Well, thankfully Adaeze really didn't experience anything at all. Jumoke on the other hand. I can only imagine. What he's got till it's gone. Jumoke, I never knew mama was so rich. I don't know about so rich. I know she's comfortable. I wish my parents were comfortable. My life would have been better. There are so many things money can't take care of, Amina. So many. Anyway, you are doing all right? What can I say? I don't mind spending a few nights in the house with you guys as well. Mummy will know something is wrong when we sleep in different rooms. So what's stopping us from sleeping in the same room? You know what. Jumoke, you can't keep blaming this thing on me now. I'm hurting as well. Was it your skin that he touched? I didn't mean it like that. Was it your hair that he pulled? Jumoke, I, I- - Was it your body that was violated? Stop it! Don't tell me about hurt or pain. I am sorry, I did not fight for you. I am sorry I could not protect you. Jumoke, I am sorry. The world would be beautiful if saying "sorry" could take away all the pain, take away all the shame. But the world isn't beautiful. It is dark and hard and cruel and evil. And the more evil you are, the more the world celebrates and loves you. Forget it. We are safe, hm? You just relax. We're safe. Well, can I see your phone? Okay, what's this? Can I talk to you for a minute? What is the problem? I have a job for you. Okay. That's it. Take the fork on the head. Exactly. Okay. You are really feeling comfortable. Would you have it any other way, Mom? It has been several weeks now. I think it is time for you to go back home. Isn't this also my home? Mom. You complain that I don't stay over. Now that I'm here, you want to throw me out. This will always be a home for you. But I don't think it is wise for you to leave your husband for so long. You won't understand. I've been hearing that since you were a teenager. Maybe a mother will never understand her daughter. But this, I understand. Growing up, I was never allowed to think of marrying someone from the next town, talk less of the next village, tribe or region. We were taught to be afraid and avoid anyone that was different. You and Emeka have shown me that is wrong. Don't let one incident destroy everything that you have worked to achieve together. Well, I'm glad I could finally get you out of that office. Well, I hope I don't waste your money because I really am not in the mood for food. Waste all you want. I can afford it. I can see that. Okay, so okay, I'll just confess. I, I actually brought you out of the office for a reason. Emeka, I want a baby. So, this is how you sneak in. Amina! Adaeze needed a pair of shoes. Of course, I would have come to see you once I got them. But you didn't come to see me the last time you were here. I only heard you came from the gateman. But you've been to Mama's place since then. Come on. I've said my own. I don't know. Why are you outside anyway? I don't know. The door won't open, like the key's not working. Come to think of it, I haven't seen Emeka in a while. But I see his sister all the time though. His sister? He doesn't have a sister? No. But she's Igbo, she's pretty, sophisticated. I love... You love her what? I love her stylish clothes. Look, Jumoke, maybe they are from the same town. You know how easterners are one another's brothers and sisters, you know? Hello Amina. Hello. Jumoke, she's here. Who? Your husband's sister. Oh! Are you coming over? Why would I want to do that? Well, you could come over to get Adaeze's shoes or to see the mystery sister for yourself. Look, Amina, if he says she's his sister, then she is his sister. I know what to do. I'll take a picture and send to you. Hold on. Amina this... Hello. Jumoke. Did you get the picture? Yeah. Well, that's his sister. That's your husband's sister. Well, do you know her? Yeah, I know her. Let one of the staff do it. Let me do it. What happened? I have spoilt everything. Jumoke, you know what happened between your dad and I? And when your sister's marriage broke up, I swore that I would never let that happen again. Let me speak with Emeka. No, no. I pushed him away. Let me talk with him myself. There's something I've been hiding from you. What is it? The night robbers came to our house. Yes. They, they raped me. My baby! Does Adaeze know? All the time she was in her room and she didn't come out. Does anybody else know? Just Emeka. Darling, let's keep it that way. Nobody must ever know. Yes, Ma. Yes, Ma. Now, we agreed, remember? Yes. Let me hear you say it then. I, I will pay you all I owe. When? Immediately, immediately, immediately. Oh, can you please? Handle him with ease. Gently. Please. As you can see, my boys are nice. Anything for the boys? This is enticement. I allowed you the courtesy of being here. We can continue questioning him without your presence. Gone are those days. Having a lawyer present during questioning isn't a courtesy. Inspector, it is a right. And what rights do criminals have, brandishing automatic weapons? My clients have a license for each and every one of those firearms. In case you have forgotten, they are providers of security services. Look, this license doesn't give them the right to rob with those guns. They are debt reminders and collectors. And they carry these firearms to protect themselves against dangerous individuals. People often show them appreciation in the course of carrying out their businesses and that is no way criminal. You're making them out to be victims here. They are. They are being subjected to Nigerian police harassment and intimidation in the course of carrying out their legitimate business. Mr. K.? Hm? What business do you have with the Abubakars and the Arinzes? You will have to ask them. My license. We need to talk. Yeah, we need to. Can I come by your mom's place tonight? Sure, I mean you're always welcome there. But I don't want us to talk with Adaeze around the house. Your mom's house is a big house, so we can always find a quiet corner to talk. All right, I'll see you later. Yeah, bye. Yeah. You don't recall anything that can help us? Inspector, I believe my statement is final and very clear. And you still don't have an idea why they came here? Haba, na Inspector. These are common robbers. Do they need an invitation to do what they do? I don't believe so. We are back. Daddy, Mummy only bought small ice cream for me. Haba, Ahmed. You should say thank you. That's the money Mummy had. It's all right, it's all right. She bought you small ice cream? I will buy you a bigger one. Okay? Good day, Inspector. Any progress with the investigation? He said that they have caught up with the gang, but they are finding it difficult to pin something on them. So, I guess that's what's playing out. Unfortunately, the rule of law has its own disadvantages. What do you mean? They have a fancy, expensive lawyer working for them. And she's good. Oh, that's sad. They really hurt my neighbors. By the way, there's no one in their house. Do you know where they are? Oh, I haven't seen much of Emeka lately but Jumoke is in her mother's house. I'll get you the address. Just hold on a minute. You're home early. Emeka is coming over. I'm sure everything is going to be all right. Not with his darling Ifeoma back. Don't you think you should have some proper food instead of snacking? Mom, it's not like I'm hungry. I just, I just want something sweet. I know things have been strained between us. Strained? You went out of town and didn't tell Adaeze or I. I didn't. I switched my phone off for a day. Too many things going on and I was lagging behind at work. Emeka, please. There is no need to sugar coat anything. I know we've come to the end of this road. What do you mean? What do I mean? You changed the locks on the house. I know you're... I know you... You know I have what? I know you are seeing Ifeoma again. Maybe if you had married her instead of me, you'd have saved us both a lot of time. I am not seeing Ifeoma. Emeka, please. She has the keys to the house. Look, it's okay if you want to go back to her, I mean I'm sure your mother would be overjoyed. You moved all your things from the wardrobe. I didn't think you wanted anything to do with that house. Very convenient that Ifeoma was there to take my place, wasn't it? Ifeoma is not taking your place. Ifeoma needs my help. Remember Nnamdi? Tall, handsome Nnamdi? Your old university roommate? Yes, Nnamdi. Ifeoma wants a baby. And she wants me to convince Nnamdi into donating his sperm to her. Well, she doesn't need the keys to our house to have Nnamdi's baby. In return for getting her that help, she's willing to help me sell that house. That is why I changed the locks and gave her the keys. What? I decided long ago you were the woman for me. If that house held a lot of pain for you, I was going to change it. I've been living in a hotel for these past few weeks because you don't want me here, in your mother's house. All I'm waiting for is for you to come and look at houses, whatever house you might want so we can be a family again. Emeka. Oh. I have failed you before. It will never happen again. I love you. I will stand by you. I will protect you. I love you, too. Mr. and Mrs. Arinze. Sorry for interrupting this lovely moment, but I... I need your help. Inspector, I don't know what it is I might do to help you. I want you to help us catch these people. I thinks that's your job, not ours. We've been through enough already. Look, we can't change what happened to you. But we can help stop it from happening to someone else. Okay? I will not put my family in any more danger than it is now. Mr. Arinze, the real danger here is letting these people back on the street, knowing what they can do. So please, if you can remember anything, come to the station. I can't hold them past tomorrow without any concrete charge. Please. She slept off? Yes, she did. Cartoon freak. Here you go, my princess. Just make sure she doesn't fall. I know. She's such a bad sleeper like her father. Eh? Like her father. She missed you so much. It's so good to be here. I've really missed you guys. I'll go down to the station tomorrow. What for? You heard what the inspector said. The real danger is letting those people back on the streets. So what are you going to tell them? I'll tell them the truth. I'll tell them that he raped me. Are you sure you really want to go through with that? You have held my client on these enticed, trumped-up charges for the last 48 hours. Are you letting him go or do I have to take this up with the higher authorities? New evidence about your client's actions just emerged. Rape? Hm? It turns out that your client raped Mrs. Arinze on the night he robbed them. No, no, no. I did no such thing. The sex was consensual. Oh, so you agree about the sex? Listen, some rich people have sick fantasies. And there was no mention of rape in the family's original statement. Hm, so? Madam, you know how touchy the subject is. I only got to know about this myself this morning. So there's no physical evidence to corroborate this new statement? Not at the moment. Let me get this straight. You plan to charge my client for an alleged rape that you allege happened several weeks ago based upon the altered statement of a person who mentioned this said rape for the first time a short while ago? This is coming to light now that you have nothing else to hold my client for. Isn't it, Inspector? This is a joke. So what happens now? Nothing. I can't do anything if I don't have evidence. Oh, come on, Inspector. I've seen the police torture people for much less than this. I told you earlier. The new Inspector-General does not tolerate any violation of human rights. And with the new lawyer they have, we need to be very, very careful. Look, people clamor for rule of law. I'm afraid this is the rule of law. So these bastards are going to get away after what they did to my wife? I am sorry for what happened to you. But without concrete evidence, I can't do anything. This is how people suffer in silence. Even the ones who are brave enough to talk, nothing happens. Mr. Arinze, I understand your frustrations. Okay? But we need to follow the rule of law, no matter how imperfect it may seem. This is how these libidinous criminals go about spreading diseases amongst innocent people. I promise you, we will catch these guys and put an end to all of this. We also advise that the victims go for excavation at the nearest hospital, at most, 24 hours after the rape incident. This procedure will help to remove whatever the attacker may have deposited in the victim, even if the attacker has HIV. This will help to separate his fluids from that of the victim and prevent the victim from getting infected. Mr. Arinze, I hope she has gone for this procedure. Babes, are you sure about this? Yeah. Yes, I'm sure. I'm not going to let those animals control me any longer. This is our home. They can't make us leave it. I'm so proud of you. Wow! Dad, I really love this center table. It spins. Please, can I have the camera? I need to record this table. - Look at this child. - Please. That's all she's interested in. Mr. K. Oh, Inspector, we see you so soon. Oh, yes! You are under arrest. Listen, Inspector, this is becoming an embarrassment. You can't keep detaining me without evidence. Look, we have new evidence against you. Oh, so you do? Hm-hm. Fantastic. Your confessions. Arrest him. - Take it easy. - Come on. Move, move, move. Where is the gateman? Going close. Ah! Inspector! Good day! What are you doing here? Mrs. Amina Abubakar, you are under arrest. What? What do you mean, under arrest? What are you talking about? What? What is this? What are you... I've tied up the gateman. All right, you keep watch outside. I've locked the boy up in a room. You see Mr. Sadiq, we are not animals. The child need not to suffer for the sins of the father, you know. Ah, please. Please, I'm sorry. Please, I'm very sorry. I will pay. I guarantee you I will pay the money, please. Listen, this is what you've been saying for the past few weeks now. Oga, I'm sorry. This time I guarantee I will pay the money. Please, I beg. I beg. Please. Mr. Sadiq. Sir? This is your last warning. Thank you, sir. Please, thank you. Okay. Now, what do you have the boys? Amina? What? Please, let me check my... Let me check the house upstairs. Why are you looking at me that way? I'm just doing my job. What does it take to hire you? No! Emeka, no! Baby, you need to watch this till the end, please. I don't care about what brought you here. I want you to do a job. We don't just work like that. We need to search the place and make sure there is minimal risk. The place I have in mind doesn't need to be staked out. You are here already. I want you to go to my neighbor's house. Okay, what is the debt of your neighbor? She owes me the debts of human dignity. Her family treats ours like trash because they think they are better than us. I know you may never have experienced that, but it's a terrible thing. I know what you mean. They think they are better, right? Exactly. Anyway, what do you want us to do? You and your boys can keep their possessions. I don't care. But I want you to threaten her and violate her. Make her feel the way she makes others feel. Make her feel worthless. Nice idea. That's not a problem. I should be able to handle that. Threaten her daughter, Adaeze. She'll be willing to do anything to protect her. I can't believe this. It gets better. Let me fast-forward it for you. How did it go? Very well, very good. The boys are very happy with the take. So what dd you to her? I did as you said. I raped her and I am sure she will never talk down you or anyone else. I didn't say rape her, I said threaten her. You asked me to violate her. I mean, it's the same. Well, that's not what I had in mind, but it's all right. It serves her right. It's okay. It's okay. What did I ever do to you? Don' give me that. Miss High and Mighty with the rich parents and the rich husband. Always flaunting your expensive things in front of me. You knew what you were doing. You were showing off. You wanted me to feel like nothing. Well, who feels like nothing now? I took you as a sister, Amina. I only wanted to help you. You liked being next to little me to show how big you are. I'm happy he raped you. I wish he recorded it. I would love to see him demean you over and over again. Amina, you are sick. My God! You need professional help. No, I'm fine. You are the one who's broken here. It got to me for a while. But no. No, I'm not broken. I'm stronger than him and I am stronger than you. Thank you, Officer. Thank you. Goodnight, sir. So, uh, the meeting I had with the inspector. Hm-mh. K. is going to be charged with rape and his boys, as well as Amina, will be charged with conspiracy to rape. That's good. His confession on camera will suffice. We did it! Yeah, we did it. I'm happy. Baby, what's wrong? Baby. Baby. Jumoke, Jumoke? Hello. Hi. Hi. Why the long face? I'm sure I'm just a little stressed, that's all. Yes, you do need lots of rest. What's wrong? Nothing you need to worry about for now. Emeka, what's going on? Is it Adaeze? Emeka, what's going on? Emeka? You're pregnant. The doctor says we could do a non-invasive paternity test, pre-natal, of course. All he needs are samples of our blood. Did you tell her I was raped? No, I did not. But won't this test raise her suspicion? Don't worry about it. I'll handle it. So when will the test be done? From the eighth week of pregnancy. It's been six weeks. Two more. Don't worry. It will be here before you know it. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Gotcha! I gotcha! I can't take this anymore. What do you want to do? Take it out. What if its ours? And what if it's not? I just want this over and done with. We'll be able to put this to rest in a few days. Mr. and Mrs. Arinze, I must tell you, though, I'm really surprised that you want this test done. It was- - Me. You said it was the right time of the month, so I... Just to cover up all things, I decided to get sperm donors in case there was an issue with me as well. Why didn't you discuss this with me, first? Spur of the moment. I got two of my friends to donate their sperm. We pushed it all in. Very commendable, Mr. Arinze. Parenthood is not in the conception. It's in the raising and nurturing of a child. So how does this work? It's quite simple, really. The DNA of the baby that's growing within you is already in your bloodstream. What this test does is it confirms that the DNA matches that of your husband. It's over 90% accurate. We should know in a day or two. Parenting is not in the conception. It's in the raising and nurturing of a child. Parenthood is not in the conception. It's in the raising and nurturing of a child. Raising and nurturing of a child, What, like here? Hm, mh. You know, apparently this leads straight to your heart. Argh, go away. It's, okay. Let me put two roads to your heart. That's actually ticklish. It's ticklish, huh? - Yes. - Oh, like this? In a good way, in a good way. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, darling. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Honey, you cannot sit on mummy's tummy anymore. Why? Well, because Mummy may be having a baby soon. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Jesus. - Huh? - Okay. Dear God, please let my mom be pregnant. I don't care if its a boy or a girl All I want is just a little baby in our beautiful home. And I promise to be a good sister. Adaeze's prayer was very touching. Yeah. I know. It makes everything easier. So, are we agreed? Yeah, we are agreed. I love you. I love you, too. Ada, wipe your mouth. Wipe your mouth. At your age? At your age? Hm. It's hot. Whoa! Your test results. Thank you. You no longer want to know? This child will be part of this family. We will raise it and surround it with love and joy. Wow! And like you said doctor, its not in the conception but in the raising and the training of the child. And by the grace of God, we will do that very well. I think I'm gonna cry.
