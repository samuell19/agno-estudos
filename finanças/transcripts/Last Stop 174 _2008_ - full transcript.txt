Something with my mother. - It's that one. - What? Your mother. - She turned into a star, right? - Yeah. So, that one's your mother? Now you pay. I found your mother. Now, pay up. I don't use that.

Only to cab drivers and messengers. You better have my money tomorrow night or you and this lowlife are dead. Don't fuck with me. Fuck you, Ale! What did you say? His name is Ale too. Take it easy. Ale my ass. - I want my money. - I'll pay you. Tonight. You should stop cleaning other people's house. It's my job. But it isn't a sin not to work. Working is good, Jaziel. You don't need to anymore. - Our church is thriving. - Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. You're a good preacher. You help a lot of people. I don't want to be a burden. You're my wife, the future mother of my kids. Is that a burden? When a man marries, he wants children. That's what God expects of us. I can't have another child until I find the one I have. That's what God expects of me. - I got nothing. - How much you got, Quico? Not my problem. You wanna die? Give me the money. You're kidding. - He's gonna kill us. - Let's split. He'll find us. - He's in with the CV. - We're screwed. The food van's here. Hey, calm down, everybody. Everybody line up. I'm hungry. Take it easy, Maicon. There's enough. We've got visitors today. They're making a film about us for French television. Feel free to start shooting. Ale! Come here. Isn't it great to be on TV? Yeah. You wanna tell your story? - Yes I do. - Go ahead. Remember the yellow light hitting the statue of Christ? I don't. Was it the sunset? I don't know, but good things are coming. - That's it? - Yeah. Ale, the NGO shelter is almost finished. - I'll take you all there. - No way, untie. This place's great. It's even got a fountain! But it's dangerous. The store owners are upset because you're robbing at the traffic lights. Relax. You forget the yellow light on the Christ? I don't think Ale's coming tonight. What if he does? I'll talk to him. He's gonna use us as an example. - Example for what? - You know. You gotta set this straight, it was your fault. I'll ask Auntie Walquiria for the money. I have her number. We ran out of time. What's the deal? You two there! Ale! Ale. Are you OK? What happened? Some guys showed up shooting at everyone, and... Let's go before the cops come. Get in. Come on, Ale. Where are we taking them? Not the shelter, the cops will look there. There's an empty shack in my community. Great! But you have to talk to the boss. Let's go. What the fuck? You had it coming, you bunch of beggars. - We were sleeping. - Calm down. They showed up and killed my brothers! - He's got a gun! - It wasn't me! On your knees! What are you doing here? I'm a minor! I'll give you an interview, not the kids. This sandwich is better than her soup. - Shut up. - I'm sure it's a death squad! I don't want to expose the children. Their lives are at risk. Why did you leave home? Do you have a father? And your mother? Don't you want to fight for your life? You've gotta speak up! You have to show the media that you exist, put on a show. - OK? - OK. Let's do it. - Can I start? - Hold it. Go. Let me tell you a story About a boy Whose mother went to heaven He was little She was nice And then for no reason She was sliced The boy grew up All fucked up No place to live No food to eat Sleeping in the gutter Pissing in a ditch Life on the street Is a bitch But the worst happened At Candelaria Church When the pigs showed up All hell broke lose Either you ran Or you died Turn on the news The cops are on the loose Society can't turn its back on these children. Ale, for example... Alessandro. His mother was murdered. - That's not true! - What are you saying? Listen. If you wanna help please call "Childhood for All" Can I give the number? 511-28-73. I'll repeat that. Marisa, you're not thinking that. What are you doing? "Stop the violence." Now, I want everybody to write their name on the banner. Ale, come with me. - Why didn't you sign it? - I can't write. You'll have to learn. Don't you wanna write your raps? If I do, I won't create new ones. I need to forget. - Even so, it's important. - I just can't! Auntie. What a nice butterfly. How nice. Two bags of ten. You're one of Walquiria's guys. - So what? - So?! Watch it! She made a deal with the boss to not sell to you guys. C'mon! My buddies split. I'm the only one left. C'mon, fix me up! Give me the cash. You better scram right now. - I'm splitting. - Or I'll kill you. - Beat it. - No problem. You crazy? Beat it! Hold it! I didn't do anything. I'm a minor! What's this? Let's go. Pass the ball! I got something for you, Ale. Stop the game! Small world, huh? My father used to say: "You reap what you sow". You bring my money? You scared, son of a bitch? Where's my money? Speak up! You wanna die? Line up! Line up! Heads down. Quiet. Don't look at me. Hey rookie! Fucking around already? Don't be a pushover. If he gives you shit, use your club. Raise your foot. The other one. Which one? Look down and raise your foot. Pick that up. Hey, Carvalh?o. - Who gave you this? - Nobody. I'll ask you again. Did you get this from that guy over there? I don't know him. Did that maggot give you the shit? - No way. - No way, boy? Come here you piece of shit. Take off your shirt. Open your mouth, raise your tongue. Take off your shorts. Squat! Give it to me. If I find anything, you're screwed. Put them back on. - Take him. - I didn't do anything. My ass you didn't. Don't look at me! Nobody look at me! WE PRACTICE THE RIGHT OF CITIZENSHIP Hey, man. This was for you. I didn't forget the money you owe me. Get up, man. Get up. I hate nothing more than a rat. I'd kill all of them. But you acted like a man. A straight shooter. That's why you're gonna live. How can you be sure Ale is your son? Alessandro is my son. How can you be sure? Mothers know these things. You don't have any children, do you? Yes. Two. I'm sorry, but my son needs help. So do many children. I can't help runaways! Mr. Z?, what about the problem outside? I'm on it, don't worry. Where'd he go? He's either out on the street, or in jail. In jail? Where? Do you have a picture ID? No ma'am. - Is his nickname Ale? - That's right. We have two boys with that nickname. My son is "Ale of Candelaria Church". Which one of you is "Ale of Candelaria Church"? You, come with me. Didn't Meleca tell you who your real mother was? I don't know any Meleca. You don't have to lie, Alessandro. That's not my name. You're making this hard. Trust your mother. Will you get me out of here? I'll do what I can, son. If you get me out of here, I'm your son. I'm gone. Alessandro, my son, this is your real mother. The mother you never met, but who never forget you. The mother who didn't raise you, but gave you birth. Before I found God I had no hope to ever find you. The day I accepted Jesus, everything changed. And now I've found you, my son. Stop! Ale of Candelaria Church. "I'll go to every juvenile court in the state of Rio and with God's help, get you out of that hell hole. Because I'm your mother and you're my son. All my love, your mother, Marisa". Faith in God and the slum kids! Didn't you say your mother was dead? That's not my mother. She's crazy. Why's that? Didn't you hear what she wrote? I'll tell you a secret, but you better keep it. - Got it. - You know who raised me? Some white bitch who ignored me. Treated me like a dog. Said my mother was a junkie, that my father killed her. Bullshit. Meleca never killed women. It was tough when my father died. Than God the bitch went with him. I think my real mother is still alive. Out there somewhere. This lady doesn't even know my real name. Isn't your name Alessandro like mine? You keep calling me Ale, but my real name is Sandro. Sandro, Ale, Alessandro: Same shit. Maybe you forgot the first half of your name. Take your letter. Praised be Thy name Oh Almighty, in the morning we announce your goodness - Hold his tongue. - I can't! Hold his damn tongue! I can't, he's possessed! Get back! Get his key! Let's go! Hold it! Son of a bitch! I'm gonna kill you! Let's split! What's up, Ale? Free, huh? - They let you go? - I fucking escaped. - He's gonna hang here. - Your name is? - Ale. - Same as you? Two Ale together is gonna be rough man! We gotta split. Take it easy. - Your bike's in that spot. - Thanks. This is my joint. There's a bar next door. Everybody respects my shit here. Make yourself at home. Jail was fucked up man. Beating us with a club is easy. I wanna see with their fists. I'd fuck them up. - This place yours? - Pretty sick, isn't it? - How'd you buy it? - With money. Nobody gave me anything in my life. - How'd you get the money? - Working. Listen to this: You don't ask for money. You take it. You ain't no street punk anymore. - You're a man now. - Gotcha. Put this on, we're going out. - No sleep? - We had enough rest. We're going out to celebrate. Where? The beach, to purify our souls in the sea. - Right on. - Today's the day. Take some cash. Great. Listen, be careful with girls. Girls are nice. Yeah, but be careful. You've got to do them and leave them. Don't get involved. No problem. I can take care of myself, bro. Girls are like drugs, addictive. But it's them who get addicted to me! Check that one out! What's up, babe! Sexy bitch! Check this out. You got that cash? You're gonna need it. How about those two? As good as done, man. Let's go. They're headed for the water. I'll stick around here. No way, man. I'm gone.

You're full of shit. You're out. - What? - You heard me! I'm not joking around! I'm not one of your buddies from Candelaria! If you fuck up, I'm fucked! I thought we were brothers. You're not cut out for this. You think people are gonna give us stuff for free? You have to take it. If they don't give it up, you kill them. Here, man. God be with you, buddy. - Just for a while, Soninha. - You're kidding! That's what you all say. I'll always want you. But you can't live here. You know it. You can't live here. "All my love, your mother, Marisa". I don't know why she thinks I'm her son. Do you think her son's alive? I don't know. Could be dead. Could be alive, could be a crook. If he's a crook, she's not gonna want him for a son. Why not? She's a Church lady, full of Bible talk. I know, I met her. Do you think I could be her son? Would you like to be? Come in. Have a seat. You've come to stay, right? Would you like me to stay? - Is there some coffee? - Of course. - Do you want help? - No thanks. My boy. My son. What'd I do? Nothing. I remember when you were a little baby. So cute. - Turned out ugly, huh? - No. You're beautiful an angel. I was devastated when you were taken away. And the thought of you with another mother. I knew she wasn't my mother. She was white. I have to tell you the truth. Lying is a sin. What lie? Meleca wasn't your father. I know he wasn't my father. Did he tell you? He didn't know. Makes no difference. All I wanted was my mother. You can sleep here for now. My husband won't like it, but, oh well. We want to build a bigger house. - You'd have your own room. - Do I have a brother? No, you're all I've got. Jaziel, this is my son. Why didn't you go to mass today? Nice to meet you. Praise the Lord. Let's talk in the bedroom. We can talk here. I need to talk to you in private. I don't keep secrets from my son. - I'm asking you to come. - Hey. Take your hands off my mother. Take it easy, son. Marisa. You don't know this boy. He's been in jail and escaped. I'm responsible for the church, understand? You're just worried about your money. You better respect your husband. Don't point your finger at my mom! - You're not her son. - What's this? Jaziel! Take it easy, son. He's a fucking joke! You're late. Where's my kiss? - That's all? - My mom's a Church lady. Take it easy! - C'mon! - Chill! No stress! - You're late and complaining? - Relax. Make yourself at home. More chips? - I'm full. - What about you? - Is that the bathroom? - Yeah. Be right back. What's wrong? It's just a glass. No problem if it breaks. Oh yeah there is. If the glass broke, I'd die and you'd never be happy. Isn't she pretty? - What? - Isn't my girlfriend beautiful? Yeah, but she's not for you to marry. Why? We've got prettier girls at the church. The toilet isn't flushing. I'll fix it later. Do you have a job? What do you do? I work with my body. When Jesus got me out of the wrong path I felt saved and found peace. Wow, you eat pussy just like a girl! I'm gonna turn over a new leaf. Get serious. I'm gonna get a job, make some money - and give my mom a better life. - Really? I'm gonna ask Aunt Walquiria to help me. What you gonna do? I'm gonna make money with my rapping and build a room for us here. Get famous, that's all I want! What do you mean? If you become famous, you'll be even hotter! Make a rap CD? And get this I'm gonna dedicate it to you. You do have talent. But that's not how it works. You're gonna help me, right? - Can you read yet? - No. - I'll teach you. - I can't learn, damn it! If you let me help, you will. I need you to lend me some money, Auntie. You have to make money working. You can learn that here. Don't talk to me like that. You're not my mother! I'm just trying to help you. You ain't helping jackshit this way. One day I'll be famous and appear on TV. Then I'm gonna tell you: "Fuck you, Auntie Walquiria"! Soninha! Open the door. Its me, Ale. I told you to call first. I'll pay to come in. I don't have the whole day. Don't give me that look. You know it's work. What's up, Ale? Wait for your turn. You know this guy? - We're brothers. - Brothers my ass! Let me explain. You wanna kill me because of a whore? She's no whore! She's my fiance! She's anyone's if you have cash. Get out!

I don't want a crook for a son. I'm no crook. Don't lie to your mother. Open the door, jackass! C'mon, chickenshit! Open up! I knew you'd come for the money. Where the fuck is it? Where is it?! Ov-over there. Ov-over there, where? Under the pillow. Pray for me, asshole. Sucker! All in coke. That's some cash! - I'll set you up real nice. - Great. Here. What can I get for this? You nuts? To swap for more coke. Let me see that. Look at this shit. All rusty. If you shoot someone with this they'll need a tetanus shot. Put it away and beat it. - Sorry about that. - Get moving! I'm watching you. There's a guy with a gun on that bus. - That one? - Yes. There he is! Hands on your head! Come out! Everybody quiet or I'll shoot! Look straight ahead! I'm gonna be late. What the hell are you doing? I'm telling my boss I'll be late. - I'm talking to the robber. - Robber my ass! Nobody move! Everybody quiet! Call for backup! She's gonna die! You! Come here. Over there! - Can you drive? - Not a bus. Figure it out dammit! - What's in the bag? - Books, I'm a student. Beat it. You'll be late for school. - Anyone hurt inside? - No. Keep it cool.
