Hi Adrian. It's Viktor. Do you remember the cave we talked about? I've done some research and there seems to be an opportunity. Might be cool, right? You, me and Charlie going on an adventure, just like the old days. Call me and we'll talk about it. - Have you been waiting long? - Just for an hour. Sorry. - Fresh air is doing me good. - Yeah I guess so. Hi. Great initiative. I'm super hyped. Me too. - You seem a bit nervous. - You think so? You're so quiet. I'll be right back. You look well. You think so? Shit. It's been a while. Yes, it has. It's been over a year, I think. At Oslo Marathon. You were standing there with some people- -eating an ice cream with tutti frutti confection on top. Look at this. What on earth! It's been a while since you had that on your head. My hair has grown. Your stomach too, right? Stop it! I can take that one. We've got plenty of space. - I'll take that. No problem. - Okay. Should we just follow you then? Well, if you can keep up. I'll manage that. The last man to arrive will do the dishes, okay? You bet! That went well? Everything's under control. I meant Viktor. Yeah. It went just fine. What do you mean? It seems like he's in a better place. Getting outside will do him good, don't you think? Sure. Get over here. Get over here. - We start out in this area, right? - Yes. Then we'll just float along the river down here. You can see how the river runs into the mountain. And if the current runs this way, the exit should be approximately here. The exit isn't indicated on any of the maps I've looked at. Which is why I'm saying 'approx'. Isn't that part of the point here? To find that exit. That's half the point. Yeah, but it's not clear whether we will find that exit or not. We can't take it too lightly. - None of us is doing that. - You just make it sound so simple. - Okay, I'm sorry. - People have died there before. - Well, yeah, that's true... - Those Belgians? You might find that funny, but it's a fact. Those were amateurs. That's my point. They had no cave diving experience. While we're in a different league. And we can diffuse bombs. That might be handy. Did you speak with your father? Yeah, he'll pick us up. I was just thinking- -that- -we'll dive until we have 30 percent oxygen left, right? Then we'll return the same way if we haven't found the exit. I reckon we should bring an extra oxygen tank. You agree? A safety tank? Yeah, why not? Cool. Are you nervous? - You aren't nervous? - No, I'm ready as hell. That's good. If you are nervous, then I'll become nervous. Yeah, I can tell. Did you fix that valve? Yeah, it was just a bit wobbly. That's nice. You're good. I don't think that's a good idea. Forget about him. Let's have a drag then. Do you remember this song? Yes. We had a nice time together, right? Sure. Do you often think about Afghanistan? No. Not really. I remember you didn't sleep that well. A lot happened at the same time. That school bus. We're thinking about having children. Well- -we're trying. Okay. - Have you started smoking again? - No, that's his thing. It's getting colder outside. We need more wool tomorrow. Yes. All good? Yes. I'm going to bed. Don't stay up too late. I'm coming. Calm down! Relax. Relax. You thought it was poop, right? You're a sick man. Did you know that? You're still strong as hell. Should we get some breakfast? I need to clean up a bit. Should we go for a swim? Yeah, if you dare. I'll go first! Hi! Did you guys see that? There was a guy over there. I saw nothing. I don't see anyone. Maybe he disappeared behind those trees. People are hiking here all the time. - It's nothing new. - Yeah. What's that? It's from Deliverance. Is that a band? No, it's a movie. Picnic with Death? Haven't seen that one. It's about four friends who goes canoeing. And then they gets kidnapped by some inbred villagers. Sounds cool. I wanna be Jon Voight. Then I'll be that porn star. What's his name? - Burt Reynolds. - That's me. Who am I then? You could be Ned Beatty. So he's the most handsome? - Sure. - He's a great guy. He's got a pig's snout, but that's all. A pig's...? Fuck you! He's the one that gets butt fucked. What? Well, that's just lovely. Should we take a break? No, we should just keep up. Take this. Who's going first? What? I can do it. Okay. Could you take care of the bags? We won't need that pincer. Why not? Someone has opened the grid. Okay. Why are we stopping? The entrance is open. They've probably just opened the cave. I doubt that. Maybe someone came up here before us? Let's do it. So where's the entrance? Just around that rock. Help me up. It's fine. It's enormous. Where did Viktor go? Wasn't he right behind you? I thought so. Viktor? Viktor? Viktor? Viktor? What are you wearing? I found a Nazi helmet between some rocks. It looks Russian. - What? - You can tell by the shape. I see. - It looks good on you. - Thank you. Don't think it's shockproof though. Who cares? It looks cool. Come on. Let's move on. Did he startle you? No. All good? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you ready? Yes. All clear! Thanks boss. Come on! Charlie? Charlie! You all alone down there? Yeah, I think she's on the loo. - Get up. Careful. - Hey! What happened? I have no idea. Everything just came tumbling down. Take this. I don't know how the hell it could come loose like that. Are you hurt? Hey? Here? How does it feel when you move? It's alright. It just really hurts. I can carry your bag for you, if you'd like? I'm fine. Hey! Are you okay? Yes. - Are we going that way? - According to this. Guys. I have to show you something. It looks like there's someone down here. Check out those rifts. I think it looks abandoned. Come on. Let's go. No. We're checking it out. - I'll do it. - Okay. I'll take it. You Okay? It smells like shit in here. What do you see? Some- -sleeping bags and diving equipment. And some climbing equipment and stuff. No dead body? Nah. We should move on. Idiot! Really funny. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Adrian! What's going on? There's a lot of blood. You alright? What are we going to do? There's not much we can do. That sleeping bag is filled with blood. So? Well. We got to get out of here and report to the police. The police? For all we know, that blood can be months old. And there could be a natural reason for this. Like what? Maybe he died of tuberculosis? I don't know. My point is that we can't do anything about this anyway. Do you get that? Viktor has a good point. One more day doesn't make any difference. We can't think like that. Hey. So what's your plan? Go to the police and tell them we happened to be on an illegal cave expedition? - Tell them we broke in and... - Let's just do as we planned. We'll keep going, and report this when we get out of here. - Isn't that a good plan? - Good plan. Sure. I bet you the blood is there tomorrow as well. Okay? Shall we go? Are you alright? Yes. Are you sure this is the right way? Yeah, I reckon this is the only way. I don't know about this. I've got a bad feeling. What is it? Looks like we can't get any further. - Did we go wrong somewhere? - No. The opening is up there. Quite something. - It looks really tight. - Come on, Adrian. You go first. Are you okay back there? Viktor? What's your status? How's it going? I'm fine. Just keep going. Relax. - Take your time. - Sure. I just can't breathe. This fucking cave. It gets a little porous up here. How's Viktor? He's struggling with his breathing. Tell him to take it easy. - He needs to lower his pulse. - I've already done that. - It gets a little tighter. - Fuck. We're almost there, Viktor. Just a little further. I'm through! Just a few metres left. Just keep at it Viktor. Almost there. My back is soaked. Only your back? Pig. Not there. It's massive in here. Hello! I don't think they can hear you. You okay down there? I can't get out. Hey! I can't get loose! What is he saying? - What? - I can't get the fuck loose! He's stuck. - He's stuck? - He's stuck! Adrian is on his way. Fuck. Fuck. Just a bit more. Come on now. - Fuck! - We got to get out! - Get me out! - Come on! Come on! Come on now! Are you okay? Vik, are you okay? Are you alright? The whole thing collapsed. There's water down there. We'll put the tent up and get our stuff together. We could make a deal. What? We can share her. Like fifty fifty. Every other week. Yeah? Bet you'd like that. Does your back feel a little better now? Yes. It's starting to get better. What? It's starting to get better. Keep massaging there. You're really stiff here. Have you noticed how he looks at you? What do you mean? He still has feelings for you. Doubt it. You had a thing before. Yes. But that was- -a long time ago. People change, right? Great that you have such a good tone. Okay. - You done? - Yup. Sure? I can't breathe. Am I smelly? You stink. This top is so difficult. So who's going first? I'm diving in front, then Charlie and you last. We'll keep together as long as possible, okay? Just follow my signals if we encounter any narrow passages. Yes. It's going to go well. I've controlled the oxygen tanks. The only thing you need to do is to calibrate the depth gauge. - Be focused now. - Fucking focused. Stay cool and we'll meet on the other side. Help! Help! What are you doing? Adrian! Help! Help! - He's not breathing. - No! No! Adrian! He just came floating up. I swear. - He's not breathing! Help! - We have to get him up! Can't be possible. One thousand, two thousand... We never should have gone into these caves. Sorry Charlie. I didn't know it would get like this. One thousand, two thousand... The cave continues that way. Let's find the exit and get some help, okay? Not without Adrian. This isn't working Charlie. He doesn't even have a pulse. Let's find the exit and get some help. Then everything will be fine. Charlie, look at me. Adrian would've told us to continue, if he was still alive. Fuck. There's nothing we can do. We'll find that exit. Then we'll get help and everything will be fine. Is he breathing? - Is he breathing? - Adrian! - Adrian? - Check if he's breathing. Check his pulse! He's got a pulse! We've got to get out! We've got to get out! Come on. Can't do it. Careful. You have to find the exit alone. - I can't just leave him here. - If you don't find it he dies. I'll stay here and take care of Adrian. Come on! Run! Run! It's only me, Charlotte. Take it easy. Take it easy, baby. Hey! Charlotte! Charlie, wait for me! Charlotte! Look at me. Look at me, Charlie. Look at me. It's me only. Yes. Hurry UP! The signals are rubbish. I can barely hear you. I should be nearby. Can you meet me? Are you at the same place? Hello? There's more people down here. The plan went wrong dad. Just come and get me, and we'll clean up the mess. Just come and get me dad. I'm alone. Yes, I found the river. Down by the river, right? Down by the river- -a big rock. I can't find the water trap, dad. Yeah, I can hear you better now. It shouldn't be that far. I've followed the route we planned. 25 minutes, okay? Same place. Yes. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Are you alright? Are you alone? Waiting for someone? Just wait there. I've got some blankets back in the trunk. Get in the car and we'll warm you up. Be careful. You're bleeding on the right side there. Feel free to eat some chicken wings. You must be starving. Thanks. I'm okay.
