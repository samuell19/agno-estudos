Production: Nichei Agency Ltd Production Corporation: Director's Co Ltd Excuse me? Is it going to take much longer? It looks like it will... I'm wondering if I should walk instead? You're heading to the Akebono Corporation, aren't you? No, no way. There's no rush, just relax and take it easy. Oh, I heard that Akebono Corporation's business is going amazingly well. As you know, Akebono's staff are there for the duration. Compared to that, you see, I have to worry about things every day. The other day, I picked up three Sumo wrestlers at the same time. It was a big mistake. The suspension got broken. Can you believe they didn't pay a cent for the damage? It's hopeless... Excuse me, how long do you think it will take? It's the worst time of the day. I'm afraid you'll have to go with the flow. Miss, never offend Sumo wrestlers, or you may live to regret it. Do you remember a Sumo wrestler called Fujinomaru? I'm not an expert in that field. Don't you remember the murder case about three years ago? The Sumo wrestler who murdered his fellow wrestler and his lover at the same time, but he was released because he was certified as insane? Actually, I heard on the news just now, that it seems like it was a planned murder. Did you read about it in the magazines? Apparently, the bodies were in a real state. Just like broken pencils, with their bones broken into pieces. Well, I shouldn't talk about this. Our next headline: The families of the victims have officially requested a retrial of the Sumo wrestler A, who murdered his fellow wrestler and lover three years ago and was arrested, but was released as a result of a psychiatric examination. This request makes formal their objection to the decision of the prosecutors to certify A as not fit for trial. The prosecution is currently reviewing the case to determine the possibility of retrial. THE GUARD FROM UNDERGROUND Makiko Kuro as Akiko Matsushige Yutaka as Fujimaru Hatsunori Hasegawa as Hyodo Directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa Oriental Security - Excuse me, Miss. - Yes. Who are you visiting? I'm supposed to meet with Mr. Kurume, the Section Manager of Department 12. Department 12? There isn't such a department in our company. What are they supposed to do? I understand that they deal in paintings. Paintings? Oh, the new department, yes it's Department 12, I do apologize. And might I ask your name? Miss. Narushima. Miss. Narushima... Narushima... Miss Akiko Narushima? Yes. - It's your first day at work, isn't it? - Yes, that's right. And... did you bring a photo? Yes, should I give it to you now? Please. You know, you need it for security. He might also be new staff. But I wonder why he doesn't get out of his car. I could only find this picture. That's a large picture, isn't it? A business card size was good enough, you know. Well, never mind. You can be sure I'll keep this safe with me. Can I go in? Yes, of course. Please. Nice to meet you and it'll be a pleasure working with you. Sorry, is it Lautrec? I've certainly heard the name, but... Yes, that's fine, Mr. Sakakibara. Certainly. It's the one you often see in magazines, isn't it? Excuse me? 18 billion yen? Mr. Sakakibara, that might be a bit... Picasso? But 2 billion yen? Mr. Sakakibara, we're not trying to be stingy, but we are very new in this field. How about a figure somewhere around 20 or 30 million yen? Yes, of course we're researching the market. In fact, we've just hired a new expert. Yes. Yes. Redon? Could you hold one moment, I'll write it down now. Re... do... n. Yes. Yes, certainly. OK, Mr. Sakakibara, leave it to us and we'll be in touch shortly. Yes. Thank you very much. Mr. Kurume, Redon's paintings were bought for 8 billion yen at Sasabi's. Shit! That bastard Sakakibara, making a fool out of us. How about this? Laurencin for 60 million yen. That's quite cheap, isn't it? It's not cheap, that's expensive. Hey, Yoshioka, is the list of paintings under 30 million yen ready yet? Well, give me a second. Well... let's see what are under 20 million yen... I guess it's Chagall. What? Chagall for 20 million yen? It's got to be a fake, hasn't it? Hey, hey, hey Yoshioka. Who bought it and when and where? Any possibility of us getting hold of it? Oh, that's a print. What?! That's rubbish! After all, all those famous ones are too expensive. But I wonder why there's so much of a price gap between those famous ones. From Laurencin for 60 million yen to Lautrec for 18 billion yen. So Miss. Narushima, what do you think about it from an art experts point of view? I'm only a curator of a museum and I'm not such an expert in the market place, but there's a significant gap between Laurencin and Lautrec in terms of their positions in the history of art, so I think those prices are appropriate. And regarding Chagall's paintings, they're so beautiful they attract very high prices. You know, it's the same with a woman. Even if she's beautiful, if nobody wants her, she doesn't have a market. Quite. By the way, about the Redon you've been talking about on the phone. Could you take a look at it? What do you think? I like his paintings, and people have finally begun to recognize their worth. A Van Gogh costs 100 billion yen nowadays, so I don't think it's unreasonable to pay 10 billion yen for a Redon. Miss. Narushima, do you know how much 10 billion yen really is? Well, if he doesn't like the painting, he doesn't like the painting. But if a painting is bought for 10 billion yen, doesn't that mean that's it's value? Stop talking as if you know everything. It's just a childish painting. Hey, Yoshioka, make sure you get the list of paintings under 30 million yen to me soon. Mr. Kurume is always like that. He's always very irritable. Please try not to get upset. No, it doesn't bother me at all. I'm here to learn, anyway. You'll get used to it gradually. But you know, Miss. Narushima, it might not be a good idea for you to get involved in this sort of business. By the way, have you met Mr. Hyodo of the Human Resources department? Not yet. I see. But I thought you joined the company through Mr. Hyodo. Yes, that's what I heard but... Anyway, you'll meet him one day. He's really scary, you know. Really? He's a kind of oddball. He always works on his own and never takes anyone else into his department. And sometimes he suddenly gets given a massive job which has nothing to do with the Human Resources department. Apparently this new business in the painting trade is also his idea. I see. Compared to him, Kurume isn't that scary. Please promise me not to get upset by Kurume's temper. Hey, Nonomura! A client's in the waiting room! Hurry up! But I'm supposed to show Miss Narushima around. Do it later. Narushima, you can wait, can't you? But she hasn't even met Mr. Hyodo yet. Hyodo?! He's in the Human Resource department which has nothing to do with us. Or Nonomura, are you an apprentice of Hyodo's? What do you mean, Mr. Kurume? Don't worry. Please go. I'll return the key myself. But do you know where the security office is? - Hurry up. - I'll be OK. Then, sorry, I'll leave it to you. No time to say sorry! Mr. Hyodo, the Managing Director is on the phone for you. What? Just tell him I'm still asleep. Security Office Excuse me? Excuse me? I just came to drop the key back. What can I do for you? I just wanted to return the document storage key. I see. But wasn't anyone in the room? - No... - That's strange. I'll keep the key, anyway. Thank you very much. Ah, Fujimaru, you're here. How's it going? Are you getting used to things here? Akiko Narushima Ah, that's Miss Akiko Narushima. She just joined the company today. The picture was too large so I clipped it to the document. She's a rather elegant lady. Who is it? Ah, it could be Shirai. Hey. Mr. Nomiya, what's your tip for the next Kikka meet? Ah, I quit horse racing. That's a shame. I have a good tip from a top Chinese horse racing authority. - I'm not going to do it anymore. - I see. I'm going to throw all my money into it. So maybe it's time for you to give me that 90 million yen back. What? 90 million yen? You said it was 80 million the other day. I told you that 1.5% interest will be added every month. Why don't you make money from horse racing again? Yeah? Hey, Shirai. Can you give me a bit more time? Yeah, I can wait, but you don't need to pay it back in cash, you know? Have you got the deeds to your property or something like that? Ah, Shirai. Let me introduce Fujimaru who just joined us today. Fujimaru? That's a silly name. It can't be a real name, can it? Are you trying to threaten me? What are you talking about? I'm not trying to do that. Then what's that guy here for?! Miss. Narushima. I think your idea of a Redon for 10 billion will work. Do you think so? But... I'll convince Mr. Kurume somehow. Let's prepare 10 pieces in the 30 million yen range and 5 in the 1 billion yen range. As a start, to avoid any risk, we should always cover a wide area and not get too much into one area. OK. By the way, can I ask you a basic question? Which do you think has more value? Is it a masterpiece by a lesser painter, or a lesser work of a master? It's got to be the masterpiece of a lesser painter. Really? Yes. The value of a painter can change in the future, but the fact that it's the masterpiece of the painter never changes. I see. Hey, everyone. Here are some sausages from Canada. The food department wants us to do a tasting. OK. Here you are. - How about you, Miss. Tadaka? - I don't want any. I thought so. Oh! It's good. How is it, Miss. Narushima? Well... Thanks. Well, let's get a cup of coffee. Ah... Mr. Yoshioka. - Can you get coffee for everyone else, too? - Alright. Shirai is late today, isn't he? Fujimaru? Fujimaru? You're there, aren't you? Ah, here you are. By the way, watch this trigger. If you switch this on it gets connected to an old electric switchboard, and it makes it short circuit. Anyway, I wonder why Shirai is so late today. Why don't you open it? Why don't you open it? What's that?! What have you done? Do you know why Shirai ended up like that? What are you planning to do? What am I planning to do? That's up to you. You're Miss. Narushima, aren't you? Yes. I'm Hyodo. Ah, Mr. Hyodo, I'm really sorry for not coming round to introduce myself. That's not a problem. So how are you getting on with your work? Yes, I'm doing alright. Good. Let me ask you a question. Yes. The Christies auction will be held this weekend in New York. Do you or don't you think it's reasonable to buy Cezanne's 'Crazed House' for 80 billion yen? Well, that's... We're talking about 'Crazed House', are we? I don't think it's too expensive. OK. Thank you. But Mr. Hyodo, it's department policy not to deal in high price paintings. It's actually nothing to do with Department 12. OK. What I just told you isn't a secret project the company is involved with. It's what I'm working on, on my own. So it's up to you if you want to inform Kurume or not. It doesn't matter to me. Don't worry. I see. I thought if he knew we had the budget to buy 80 billion yen paintings he would perhaps change his policy. Do you really think he would? Unfortunately, I don't expect anything out of Kurume. Whatever happens, he'll soon be on his way. So what do you think Department 12 will do from now on? It's all up to you. But I don't know... Frankly, all the staff in Department 12 are useless. But... First of all, Hanae Takada. She's enthusiastic, but that's the only thing. She's conceited and totally useless in the real market scene. That's too harsh. Next is Ken Nonomura. He can only do what someone else tells him to do. He's weak, and friendship is the only thing he can offer. And finally, Minoru Yoshioka. That's an easy one; he's simply trash. You must've realized that for yourself by now. Mr. Hyodo, did you form Department 12 to watch it collapse? Why did you do such a thing? Is it all for the company? Why do you think you have the right to do such a thing? I can hardly believe it. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. That's OK. Thanks for the Cezanne information. Narushima? Narushima? Please come here. Narushima, please take a seat. It's an insulin injection. I've got diabetes. Don't you think postal savings are a good thing? They attract a much higher interest rate. I see. You should take care of your mum and dad well. Yes, thank you for your concern. Just relax. Narushima, I'm not going to do anything to you, but I just want you to look at me. Hello, is that security? I'm in the document storage room, but I've been locked in and can't get out. I'm really sorry, but would you come and open the door? Thank you. Isn't Miss. Narushima with you? What? She's not back yet? No, I haven't seen her since lunchtime. Taking it too easy, isn't she? Excuse me? Are you the security officer? Is there something wrong? Ah, the back door! Anything suspicious happened? Someone was on the other side of the back door. Yeah, perhaps it was our new recruit. He's not used to the building so I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused. - So that was it? - Yes. Miss. Narushima, what's wrong? It seems she locked herself in the document storage room. Yeah, everyone does that at first. Thank you very much. I'm fine now. OK, here you are. Miss. Narushima, please come here. What was that for? You didn't do anything funny to Miss. Narushima, did you? No way! But it seems to have taken far too long just to unlock the door and come out. I didn't do anything, believe me! I know you're peeping at girls on the CCTV. No... I know you are. I know it. I don't care if you try it on with those old bitches. But don't ever try it on with the young girls in my department. You got that? Miss. Narushima, you can go home early today if you want. I'm fine. If you get yourself locked in the room, you just have to call the security office. Yeah... that's what I did, but... Did something else happen there? The security guard came, but there was something strange... The new security guard? So have you actually seen him? No. Miss. Takada, have you seen someone like that? No, I haven't. I've seen him. He was huge. I wouldn't be surprised if he was able to break the door down. Anyway, he was absolutely massive. About two meters tall. But I guess his brain didn't grow too well. He couldn't even figure out how to open the door. Miss. Narushima, it's been a nightmare for you, hasn't it? Nonumura, could you pass me that file over there? Sure. Miss. Narushima, could you do a gallery check up? Sure. Next is the latest news about the ex-Sumo wrestler who murdered his fellow wrestler and lover. The prosecutor has decided his re-trial can go ahead and they are currently looking for him to take him into custody. Kurume of Department 12! That's him! Koji Kurume 45 years old. He's normally with other staff during the day, but he often works overtime on his own. If you want, I can check for him on the monitor. But you don't have to kill him. It's not enough to simply kill him. Put him in a state where he's almost dead. Almost dead... You must be having so much fun. Since I met you, I've been having a lot of fun, too. Especially today... What's that? Did you steal that? Certainly not. Someone left it for me. Do you have any idea why she did such a thing? Maybe she's trying to test me. But I don't have time for that sort of thing. Ah, here's the key to the document storage room. OK. Excuse me. Can I ask you one thing? Has anyone handed in a lost earring? Earring? Yes. It's the same as this one. I see, I'll let you know if I find one. Thank you... very much... Miss. Narushima, I finally saw the new security guard this morning. I see. Oh my God, he was massive. You'll be surprised. And I just heard a rumor that he used to be a Sumo wrestler. Well, no wonder he's massive, yeah? I see. He used to be a Sumo wrestler. But I've never seen him on TV, have you? Do you really think someone that successful would end up being a security guard here? Yeah, I guess. So he's a failed Sumo. How sad. But you know, he's a bit weird. He's wearing an earring, but only in one ear. He might think it's fashionable, but it makes me laugh. Really? I see. Hey, you two. Stop talking rubbish. OK, OK. Excuse me? Hey, if you want the security guard, he's just gone down to the basement. Ah, I see. ENTRANCE TO BASEMENT No, no, you're not allowed to go in there. Oh, I'm sorry. What do you need? Nothing special. Do you work for this company? I'm from Department 12. Department 12... I've never heard of it. Don't try to make a fool out of me! What do you want? Excuse me, has a security guard come down here? I don't know. I see. Yeah, if you see the security guard, can you tell him to clean the switchboard? It's such a mess. I'm here for electrical work, but always have to clean up first. I'm really sorry. Well, it's not your fault. Anyway, can you hold this? Sure. You know, nowadays, labor costs are so high, if three or four days are needed just to sort out an electric circuit, a small company could go bankrupt in the meantime. Come to think about it, I saw someone over at the back of there. I don't know if he was a security guard though. Problems, eh? Our company doesn't have direct control over the security office, that's being managed by another company so I'm not sure who to talk to about it. I suppose we should contact the security company to complain? Or do you think we should even call the police? I'm not worried about my earring being stolen, but... It's your picture, isn't it? Yes... I can understand how uncomfortable you must feel. But you're the one who gave them the picture and dropped the earring. Yes... I suppose I'm being paranoid. Listen up. You should have a word with Mr. Hygo at the Human Resource department. You mean that Mr. Hyodo... Yes, he's the best person to speak to. I know he's a bit strange, but he's got connections with many departments outside Human Resources. If you find it awkward, I can speak to him for you. No, I'll be fine. I've met him once before anyway so I'll speak to him. OK, cheer up. Yes. Mr. Hyodo, an internal phone call from Miss. Narushima from Department 12 for you. Wake me up at 6 in the evening. Are you really? No, that's fine. Yes, OK. OK, see you tomorrow. Yoshioka's also going home. OK. They're not very nice, are they? They knew we were having your welcome party. Shall we have a party with just the two of us? Well... I've got some work left to do anyway. Are you doing overtime? But it's not safe, you know that, don't you? The security guard... Hey, Nonomura, let's go home. Yes, but... Narushima's got some more work to do, haven't you? Yes, a bit. Did you get it? I'll help Miss. Narushima today so would you like to go home? Nonomura. Yes? Let's go home... Yes. So, Miss. Narushima, time to go home. Ah! I left something there! Nonumura, you go home first. What's wrong? You go home now. Why... don't you do anything, I'll do it for you... Shut him up! You don't have to kill him! You know that, don't you? There's no need to kill him! Please stop! - Excuse me? - Yes. I'm from Department 12. Has Mr. Kurume been to your office? Mr. Kurume? No, I haven't seen him. OK, fine. Narushima, what do you need? Have you been with Mr. Kurume? No, couldn't you have called me for that? I tried, but I can't seem to connect to your office. What? Yeah. I forgot my secretary is off work today. What time is it? It's 11 o'clock. I see, 11 o'clock. So in New York, it's 9 at night, so I guess it's too late to call. Ah... sore throat. I'm gonna have to give up smoking. If you hear from Mr. Kurume, would you tell him to come to Department 12 immediately? OK, fine. - I'm sorry to bother you. - Fine. Hey, Narushima. I'm sorry, really sorry, but could you bring me something to drink? Anything will do. Ah... so delicious. Mr. Hyodo? Yeah? Do you know the new security guard? No. I see. Is there something wrong? He's a very large man. If you see him, you'll know who I'm talking about. He's... wearing the earring I dropped the other day. Somehow the whole thing's giving me a bad feeling. Let me check for you. No one's at the security office at the moment. Fine. Then I'll sort it out later. Thank you very much. And... Narushima. When you get back to the office, you can tell Takeda to act as Deputy Manager while Kurume is away. Alright? Certainly. Great news, Miss. Narushima! It's a response from Haruko, the art dealer. They're going to sell us a Chagall painting for 2.5 million yen. Really? We're gonna be busy. Nonomura, get me the list of potential buyers urgently, will you? Hello, Akebono Corporation. Hello, Mr. Sakakibara. Yes, it's me, Takada. Right. No, Kurume is off today, so I'm in charge. Ooops, I'm sorry. It seems like we'll have to do overtime again today. Yes, it seems like it. Hello, Akebono Corporation. Thank you for giving us a call. Yes, we can do that right away. Yes, it seems like it. I'm really sorry to bother you. Not at all. Yes, of course... Miss. Narushima, can you come with me please? Sorry? Can you please? What is it? Was it really bad last night? Sorry? What do you mean? Mr. Kurume didn't come in because of what happened last night. He's like that, but he's still human so I guess he feels too guilty to face you. Did something happen last night? Mr. Kurume came back to the office to see you, didn't he? No, he didn't. I knew what might happen, but knowing didn't mean I could do anything... Honestly, he didn't come. But he left me downstairs and went back up to the office. Really? I should've protected you, Miss. Narushima. Mr. Nonomura, I think you're misunderstanding me. Mr. Kurume didn't come back to the office last night. Then... where has he gone? What do you think you're doing, Fujimaru? She's nothing to do with this. Why? You don't seem to understand what kind of person I am. Yes, I do. I know that very well. Please forgive me. I won't tell anyone. Please forgive me. What should I forgive you for? Please take your hands off me. Just... If you know what kind of person I am, then what do you know about me? You're breaking... my spine. There's no way you can fully understand what kind of person I am. Thank God... Thank you... Thank God... Are you going to call the police? And even if you don't call them, they'll eventually come here. Why are you in such a rush? No... I'm not... going to call the police... It's true... Never forget me. Of course. Make sure you don't. Well, let's have some coffee. Mr. Yoshioka, don't worry. No, don't worry. I'll make some for you. Don't worry, really. Seriously. Oh thanks. What's happened to you? I'll call an ambulance immediately so please don't move. Mr. Yoshioka, listen. We're going to have to get out of here immediately. It's an emergency. Hey, hey, wait. What do you mean? Hey, Nonomura, you're right. She was down here. Are you alright? You were taking so long, we were wondering where you'd gone. Someone's been killed down there. What?! It's the security guard, the very large one. Watch it. He might still be there. Miss Narushima, go back to the fourth floor. Mr. Yoshioka! My God! We have to get out! What's going on? It's no good. It's been cut! Let's find the exit. No good! Let's go back to the fourth floor. I'm worried about Miss. Takada. It won't work. Miss. Takada! You're here. What are you doing? It won't work. What's going on? I just can't get the lights back on. Just forget it. We're going to have to get out of here now. Someone's been murdered. We're in danger too. What are you talking about? It's that security guard. What are you on about? How about Mr. Nonomura? Where is he? I don't know. He came back once, but went out to make coffee. In the kitchen! What? Hey! Wait! What's this? What's going on? What... It's terrible. What shall we do Mr. Yoshioka? OK, let's break the window on the second floor and jump out. It's you, is it? I've heard about you. This is horrific. Do you know what you're doing? You don't know, do you? Well, that proves that you're funny in the head. I'm gonna call the police now. So give me the key. Let's do it like this. Put the key on that trolley, and you can leave. Can you do that? Come and get it. Well, I'm gonna leave it for now. I've no choice... I'll look for an exit. See you then. No! All the doors are locked. How about that one? It's locked too. Why can't the lights come back on? Someone do something! It's impossible. He's cut the electric circuit. It's over... No one can escape from here. Don't give up. Mr. Hyodo. Are you doing overtime too? All the doors on the second floor are locked. I see. He's rather clever, isn't he? Two have already been killed. We have to do something. Is this all of us here? Yes. OK, let's go to my office. This is the only door that can't be opened with any of his keys. Mr. Hyodo, how long are we going to wait like this? Is there any way we can get out of here? I'm trying to think of a way. Is there anyway we can contact someone outside? Shall we wave from the window? I doubt anyone's going to see us at midnight. The telephone line's been cut, so we can't use the fax either... Yeah, how about the telex? That should use a different line. Unfortunately you're in the Human Resource department and there's no telex here. There's one in Department 12. Who's going to go back there now? I'll go. Mr. Yoshioka, please don't go alone. We should all go together. No, that's not a good idea. Miss. Narushima, I'm a fast runner, so don't worry. He's not gonna catch me. But where can I send a telex? It's midnight. To New York. Narushima, I was wrong when I said that Yoshioka is trash. Great, it's working. Mr. Hyodo! I know, it's taking too long. Someone's got to help him. Yeah, it might be too late though. You shouldn't go on your own. If Mr. Yoshioka's injured, you'll need help to carry him back here. I guess so. Listen to me. Is it over? Have we been saved? Not yet. I see... Mr. Hyodo and I will go out. You should stay in this office. This room is safe, but please make sure you lock the door. When we get back, we'll knock three times and then you open it, OK? So, he couldn't send it. God, Mr. Yoshioka! Yoshioka! Yoshioka! Did you send the telex? Great, well done! Who is it? Miss. Narushima? Mr. Hyodo? Who is it? You're supposed to knock three times. No... No... I'm not going to open it. Please wait, don't go! No! No! Don't do it! No! Please... please stop it. Why? Why are you doing this? If you want to know why, you need to be brave. I'm brave, so please explain why. You're just unlucky. What do you mean? It doesn't answer my question. I want to know about you. You can't kill me, can you? Then please don't do it anymore. Please! You suddenly appeared in front of me. That's when it started. I knew this was going to happen. The time that flows through my body is different to what you and the others have. What kind of time is that? It's the time of despair. That's not right. You're a human being just like me. Time flows equally for everybody. Totally wrong. Why don't you use your brain more? I understand. I won't try to understand what kind of person you are, so leave me alone. Please go back to where you belong and never come out. So you're the same as the rest of them. You refuse to believe that someone like me can exist in this world. I won't believe it. But I'm right here. I've explained enough. Never forget... about me. Are you alright? Yoshioka's alive. And we've just sold that Cezanne painting for 85 billion yen. Well, they called us from New York in the middle of the night. We wondered what was going on...
