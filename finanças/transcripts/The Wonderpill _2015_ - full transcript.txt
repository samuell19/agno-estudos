- What's up? Babe? What's that? What is that doing here? What is this? What the? - Yeah this whole fiasco started about five, six years ago when my wife passed away, Jessie's mom. He was never the same after that. He just stopped going to school. He just disappeared for days on end. I had no idea where he was; when he'd come back, he'd have no answers for me, just like talking to a wall. He even sold my dead wife's jewelry. I mean how low can you go? A disgrace, how can you do that? I mean she just died; you sold all the jewelry. - I wanna know what is that doing here. I don't know. Sit down! He's killing what's left of my family. My biggest fear is that I'm gonna lose Jessie, lose another loved one. I mean first my wife, and now I see him going, going away, even dying. Nothing else to say. I don't know what else to say. I don't know what to do. Fuck you, I'm an Egyptian Christian, asshole. - Hey, Sweetie Puss. What a fucking mess, huh? You know, it really wouldn't hurt you to clean up every once in a while. - Sup, Fish? - Dang, Sweetie Puss. How ya doin', Sweetie Puss? - You had a good time with the boys? - Uh-Huh. You know, Sweetie Puss, I was thinking. How 'bout we fuck? - Fuck Fish, you really know how to make girls' juices flow. - Don't tell me you got another migraine. - I have one every day as you already know. - A couple of months, it's gotten worse. He started getting-- - Come on, Sweetie Puss. Come on, you gotta give me a little blowjob, alright? Come on, just a little sucky sucky, huh? You know what I'm saying? - Okay, but you gotta close your eyes. - Alright. - That bitch, I swear to to fuck. - I'm flabbergasted. You're a lunatic, Athena, but a lovely one. - I just don't understand why this dick has no empathy. He's such a selfish bastard. - I agree completely, Honey, but true love should carry every burden in a relationship. - Fuck true love; I'm not sure that even exists. - Love should be overarching. At least, that's how I imagine it if I ever find Mr Perfect. - Oh, you will babe; you will. You're the most awesome and beautiful girl in the world. The only problem is this world is filled with assholes. They don't appreciate girls like you. Check. - You're welcome. - You know, I might stay a little longer. Can I have a latte? - Sure. - One of the difficult ones? - One? I forgot when I last time enjoyed this fucking job. - Hey, coming to get your coffee? - Ladies. - Helen Darling, how are you? - Good, thanks. - So what's up? - Not much, and you? - Life is marvelous and Jacob is a treasure. - I see. - It's not even worth talking about. It's always the same issue. - I'm sorry to hear that. So how's Mom? - There's something called visiting, girl. Have you heard of telephone to get in touch with people you know? - I know and I feel bad about it, I do, but I'm in the middle of final exams and I have no time for anything. - Hey, Mom is not just anything. - Damn Athena, you know exactly how I meant it. - Here go, Baby. - Thanks, I gotta go. I promise I'll try to visit her. - Yeah, adieu yourself in the ass. - So yeah man, it must have been like eight months ago. - Yeah, fuck that; I can never go that long without it. - Yeah bro, and bitch is a lazy ass too. You should see the mess in our crib, bro. - Have you ever thought about cleaning up after yourself? - What do you think I'm doing every second week? But it only takes her a day and we're back into motherfucking Hoarder's Paradise all because of those fucking migraines and other excuses. I don't wanna talk about that. - You know, migraines have become an epidemic in the last 20 years and the causes are really hard to diagnose. You should take that seriously and take her to a neurologist. - She's been to every specialist, alright, not to mention taken every pill on this planet, every scan, CAT Scan, MRI Scans, you know about that shit. Dude, asshole scans! Nothing works, that's why I'm starting to think it's all fucking bullshit. - Maybe she should try some alternative medicine, acupuncture, something like that. - Fuck it, I don't want to talk about it, man. But guys, guys, what I always wanted to know is Carl, when you have a spontaneous fuck with a nice chap right, how do you know the mangina's shit-free? No, not again; fuck bro! - Every time we get together, he starts with assholes and shit. - He has a real deep anal fixation, right? - No no, but seriously, like what happens? You guys are horny as fuck and 14 year old rapists, right? And then what? Oh no wait. No, wait, wait, stop! I gotta clean my asshole with an enema. - Here we go, I can see - wonderful image. - 14 year old rapist, really? Why? - No, but seriously guys. Oh no, wait, I know what happens. Do you take like a laxative a couple of hours before? Oh no wait, you do some drill testing, right? You do some drill testing. - Be serious and stop. I'm totally beginning to think you're a homophobe, alright? - Of course, yeah, and that's why me and Carl have been friends forever and we run a shop together, right. Oh and by the way, you've never told me if you're a top or bottom. - And you will never find out. - They should make a pill for your homophobia, bro. - Speaking of pills, alright I just read the latest placebo research. It's actually pretty interesting. - Yeah, yeah, nice way to change the topic. - Anyway, so listen, people with chronic back pain, alright, were giving a placebo pill and if they trust their doctor, the back pain was cured, no pain whatsoever. - You mean just like a sugar pill? It's like a - But they knew it was a placebo? - No no no, it worked either way. - Wonderful. Alright fellas, good seeing you guys. Have a good night. Carl, see you tomorrow, alright? - Alright. Take care, man. - See ya at the shop, Carl. - Anyway, Jacob I gotta go. - No no, wait Max, I got something to tell you. Alright, I have a brilliant idea. - Yeah, right. - Yeah and fuck you too, okay. - You know, I was thinking, what if we told Athena that you have this new drug for migraines. - Say what? - Placebo, bro, alright. We'll tell her it's this new experimental drug, not FDA approved, yada yada yada. - This sounds really not like-- - Wait, wait, and here comes the kicker: You're gonna tell her it's a, she'll have this insane desire for constant sex, alright, an exploding libido, alright. Dude think about it. - You're crazy. No way, no way. No way. - Max listen, think about the fucking field study you can make of this. This can be the solution, man. - It's ludicrous, it's unethical, it's plain wrong. You've got some major malfunctions up there bro, okay. No way, I gotta go. - But Max, I'm sorry, alright. Wait, I gotta explain. - There's nothing to explain. Just let it go, okay. I'm not gonna do anything evil to Athena or anybody, okay? I've gotta go. - Dude, I'm serious. I'm just embarrassed to say it, okay. Athena wants to break up. - Really? - Yeah, we had an argument and she basically said she doesn't see a future, man. - That's not good. I mean I'm sorry. It's kinda understandable considering what kind of boyfriend you are, but it's still not good; I'm sorry. - I mean, of course, but when I'm with you guys, you know, I'm all macho and stuff, but dude, when I'm alone, I cry in my pillow, man. Yeah. - You guys have been together for six years and I've seen so many changes in you, and not all for the better. I mean, you used to love to cook, new recipes, great culinary feasts. No offense, darling. - Sorry Mom, next time I'll cook you real food. - Oh Honey, I'm kidding, but I'm serious about your hobbies, your passions, the way you used to paint, dance for hours on end on the weekends. Now on top of everything, you've gotta come here and take care of me every day. - Stop it, Mom; you know I love you and I would do anything for you. We don't have money for a nurse. - I know, Honey. I just feel bad that you gotta spend so much time over here. If only your spoiled sister would step up. She doesn't even visit anymore. - She has final exams. - Pfft! - Anyway, I think all my issues are from my migraines. They're draining me out, and my sex drive, it wasn't hot to begin with. - Then maybe you need to think about when your migraines started. Sweetie Puss? You know, I'm sorry. I really am. I know I should be more understanding. - I'm sorry I slapped your dick. - Yeah, that was a brand-new experience, huh? - I know you liked it. - I love you, Sweetie Puss. - I love you too, Fish. - I was just talking to Max and he said he had this new experimental drug for migraines. - You know, I've tried everything. - This worked on like the most extreme cases. - Really? - This looks like the real deal, the real shit, you know what I'm saying? - I don't know. I'll think about it. Maybe I'll talk to him. - Yes, because they're experimental and they wanna test the reactions and the side effects. - Which are? - Ha, well that's a bit of a caveat really. In some of the test subjects, they've experienced restlessness, uber-high energy and sleeplessness. - That's not so bad. - Well there is another side effect, yeah. - Fuck Max, don't keep me on tender hooks. - Well, you may experience an elevated libido. - Haha, that will be the day. Anything else? - No, no. Well, actually yes. I mean, yes. It's not just an increased libido. Some of the other subjects, especially the female ones have experienced an extreme lust for sex, a constant need for sex, craving for sex all day long, just sex, sex, sex, sex, all day long, sex, sex. - Huh. And you're saying all these subjects have no migraines after taking just one pill? - I don't know if I would take the pill, Honey, especially 'cause it's so experimental. I don't know, maybe try it for a couple of days and see how you feel. - Fuck sis, if I had headaches every day, I would most def try it. - Lady. - Yummy. - Yeah 'cause that's what some ladies told me after getting the special Anthony treatment. - Wow, you should really be a porn star. - This is just the beginning, look. - Yeah Baby, show me what you got. - Okay, okay, I see we're talking with talent okay, but see, Helen and Susan over here, they're lesbians, and Lola over there, she has big dick, and I'm married sand have four kids. - What the fuck did you bitches do to Anthony? - Okay girls, I think it's time. - Yeah. - What, what the fuck happened? My god. - That was crazy. - Did you see? Come on. - You wanna end up like this guy back there? - What do you mean? - That's how all men are, no? Always thinking about sex, and therefore, they have no other brain to be left for anything else, right? And as you said, this is the biggest side effect of your migraine pill, a crazy libido. I mean you don't even know if this is the worse side effect. You could become suicidal, or even homicidal, right? - Oh wow, Sweetie Puss, I don't remember the last time you made breakfast. - Hey Baby. - Hey, Sweetie Puss. - I love it hard and wide, Baby. - Alright. - Gee Athena, are you okay? - Susan, I can invade a small country in a bikini with an AK-47 and become fucking queen by the end of the day. - I'm so happy for you. - I mean it's not just the energy, headaches are gone, migraines are gone. It's all fucking unbelievable; I love it. - Aw Sweetie. - We fucked like three times this morning. - Good for you. - And I rubbed carpet twice since then. - Wow, so it really is true about the side effects. - And I'm in heat like a fucking dog. I mean, you see this guy? I'll go to fuck him until he kicks the bucket. - Oh eww, Athena, that's disgusting. - And I'll still fuck him nonstop. - Oh my god! - 'Til rigor mortis dissipates. - Okay stop, stop, I can't listen to this anymore. - Three days later. - You're gonna make me pee my pants. - Panties are so soaked from my coochie dripping like a fucking leaking honey pot. - Holy shit. - Fuck it, I'm going to the bathroom visiting funny fingers. Pale lord. - No worries, Sir, it's just our TV. - Yeah, sounds like one of those nasty titty films. Hey Athena, all good? - All good. Sir, would you like anything else? It's crazy, I never ever felt so pumped up. It's the best shit ever happened to me. The problem is I have too much energy, and of course insatiable lust for sex all of the time. It's strange, but I'm loving it. - Maybe you should try some yoga or Pilates, you know, something to calm down. - Yes, that's a good idea. - No, with a bunch of pretentious bitches? Nah. - Hey, I do Pilates. - Exactly. - I know, we should try Zoomba. - What's that? - It's this fitness program in which you go over Latin American dance moves. - Sounds interesting. - Sounds better. Let's try it tomorrow? - Hey I need a break. I need a break. - You okay, man? - Yeah. I don't know if I'm gonna survive the sting. So how are things going with you and Athena? - Oh great man, yeah. You know, she's always energetic; she's very happy. Oh yeah, and she doesn't talk about breaking up anymore. - That's good to here, Jacob. It's good to hear. So, how's the other thing? You know, if you don't mind me asking. - What? The fucking? Oh man. - Yes. She's not going crazy is she? - No no no man, I'm telling you, she's a machine. We fuck like crazy. In fact, dude, I can't even keep it up sometimes, alright. You know Max, I was thinking, can we like probably tweak it down a little bit? Yeah man, it's like, you'll just tell her that, you know, it's, the side effects are just a, temporary, you know, and that in time, she'll just, it will go down, you know, her libido. - Jacob, Jacob, stop complaining, man, okay. A placebo can be a powerful thing. I did you a favor, now you have to deal with it. I'm not gonna tell her anything, okay. You just have to deal with it until we finish the experiment, okay, which I hope is gonna be soon. - Woah woah woah, wait a second, man. You don't gotta wet your panties, alright. Damn. - Hola, Senor, como esta? Senor, you're very very dirty. I must clean you now. - Four steps back and back in the center. And some jumping jacks and one, two three, cooling off and that's it, guys. Good workout, give yourselves a hand. Awesome. Such a great class, isn't it? - It was awesome; I'm glad you worked it out. - Yeah, yeah. - It was awesome. - Cool, you guys new to the class, right? - Yeah, first time. Great workout. I'm Helen, this is Athena, Susan, and Lola. - Hi. - You look like you had fun, but you, Athena right? You've done Zoomba before right? I mean you, you're a professional dancer? - No actually, I'm the opposite, more of a couch potato. - A couch potato? I never would have guessed. I mean you've got great moves, lots of stamina. - Oh yeah, Athena, she's got lots of stamina. - Okay, nice to have met you ladies, okay bye. - So Honey, how are you doing? How are your exams going? - Good, I can't complain. I've got one last exam, and then I'm officially a paralegal. - I'm so proud of you. - Good job. - Thank you, Honey. - Now, I completely forgot you can cook. It's marvelous. - How's your love life? Anybody we should know about? - No, not really. Well, there kinda is. - What the fuck does that mean. - I'm having an affair, okay. - Oh, we got a little devil here. - He's married and has kids. What can I say, I'm the cliche mistress waiting for him top leave his wife. - Fuck and you didn't tell me about it? - How long have you been canoodling? - I don't know exactly. It doesn't matter; I'm not sure about him anymore anyway. - Oh Honey, I'm sorry, but you know, you're a pretty, intelligent young woman. There's gotta be a nice, normal, decent guy out there for you. - You can't help who you fall for; it's how it is. - I'm still shocked that you kept this dark secret. You have to tell me all about him. - The truth is I'm more concerned about you. - Why? - You're not yourself anymore, and I can't help but wonder if this drug isn't doing you some damage. - No need to worry; I've got it under control. I feel fantastic. There are no negative side effects. - Yeah, what's the issue, Honey? - I just have a bad feeling, that's all. - Hey, Sweetie Puss, how'd it go? - Good, but not as good as your dick. - Woah, Sweetie Puss, wait, wait. You know what? How 'bout you let me finish this game, and after that, I'm gonna fuck you so hard you won't be able to sit for a week. - I hope that's a promise. So I asked if he's be serious. - And? - And he says, "Yes, of course I'm serious." We should nuke Africa and all the other loser countries, Problem solved. - Holy fuck, where did you find this loser? And on top of everything, he expected me to pay, and he expected me to take him to my place to fuck. - Oh, and did you? - Are you crazy? I would have rather fucked a granny in a wheelchair. - But he was hot? - Yeah, killer features, killer body, a real fucking Adonis until he opened his mouth. Ignorance is so unattractive. - Absolutamente. - Sweetie, are you okay? Holy shit, Sweetie. - Can I talk to you in private? - Yeah, yeah. Feel okay, Sweetie Puss? - I'm in pain; it hurts so much. - Where, your head? - No. - It hurts so much over here. - What the fuck, Sweetie Puss? I thought something bad happened? - Come on, Fish, don't be a pussy; stick it in. Destroy me, come on. - I don't got time for this! I'm working as you can see. - Are you fucking serious? You're gonna really let me hang with this? - We fuck like a million times a day and it's not enough? - Oh, that's how it is? When you wanted to fuck, it didn't matter if I was in the mood or not, right fucker? - I'm gonna get a coffee. - I gotta finish this t-shirt like by tomorrow for a client, okay? - Screw you, limp dick. - Hi there; what can I get you guys? - Two vodka tonics and two Merlot. - Can I see some ID please? Really? Your name's Athena Cockburn? Cockburn? - Dude, I hear this all my life. It's pronounced Co-burn. - Okay, alright, didn't mean to offend, Co-burn. The way you look, I wouldn't be surprised if your name wasn't a prophecy for most men. - Only the ones who are worth it. - That's good to know. I'm Gavin. - We need to change our last name. - Or get married. - And have a lot of kids. Unbelievable. - Who the fuck would have thought that? - He's very interesting fish. - Can always stick it Yeah. - That's what makes him hot. - Nah, and he could be your father. - Still, you know, there's something intriguing and mysterious about him. So how's Jacob? - Good. - Any fights lately? - Not really. Look, Fish just doesn't wanna fuck enough. It is becoming a vaginal issue. I don't know how long I can hold it back before I jump fuck the next passing dick. - Hell, why don't you do it with somebody? - What? - I mean, you don't have to tell him. - You really surprised me lately. - Hey, maybe I'm just maturing and becoming more realistic, or pragmatic depending on how you look at it. - No, I could never do that? Well, I hope so. - Hello, ladies. I guess Jersey City is a village after all, huh? - And you must be the village jester, you know, singing and dancing. You must tell jokes too. - No, no jokes, and I'm very bad at telling jokes. - Are there any talents or other professions we should know about? Maybe some secrets? - No secrets. Well actually, I do have a couple of women chained in my basement because I do enjoy the occasional human filet mignon in a red wine sauce. It's a joke. I told you, I'm very bad at telling jokes, okay. Hey, why don't you let me buy you a drink, okay? - Sure. Thank you. - Hey, I'm having a party at my place next week. You guys wanna come? My friend, Theo, is coming. - Oh yes, thank you for the invite. We'd love to come. - You okay? - Of course. Are you doing anything, like right now? I think we can go to your place, and you know? - Oh okay, I get it. No, actually I really have to get up very early tomorrow and go to work. - Sure. No problem. Holy fuck! More! More! Come on! Fuck! - Place, deep breath, and that's it. Thank you, great workout everybody. Athena, do you have a moment. - Victor, listen. - I just, look. - Victor, I told you I was drunk, okay. I'm sorry. Let's just stay friends and not mention this again. - I'm sorry, okay. I'm just not used to this kind of thing. - What do you mean? - Dating and stuff. I apologize, okay again. I just wanted to come over for a drink and chat. I'm not a one-night-stand type of guy. I'm not saying you are either. I'm just saying, you know, I'm not used to getting offers from beautiful young women. I just want to get to know you better. Please. Please. - You're not going to chain me in the basement, are you? - Hi. - Holy shit, Fish. What is your third job? A drug dealer? - I used to manage a hedge fund. It's along time ago, back in the 90's. - So bank stuff? Are you rich? - Well, let's just say that this condo's very modest compared to the house I used to live in, but I can't complain. - And why did you stop robbing people? - I actually had a burn-out, so I just took all my money and left Manhattan. - And now you are a singer and a Zoomba teacher. - Yeah maybe, in a way. Would you like some white wine? - Sure. - Thank you. Who's this? - Oh, that's, that's my sister. - She's beautiful. - Yeah, she was. She passed a long time ago. - I'm so sorry to hear about that. - Yeah well, that's life. Would you like to sit? - Sure. - Are you okay? You're not uncomfortable here with me, right? - I'm so sorry. I have so much shit going on right now in my life, and I did things I'm not proud of. - Oh? - Actually, I'm very comfortable around you, and I feel like I can talk to you about anything. - Great, same here. - I cheated on my boyfriend. - Okay. - Just so atypical of me. I've never done anything like this. Now I'm full of guilt and I don't know what to do. - I mean, where you guys having issues or did you just fall in love with somebody else? - No, it was one time thing, and I mean I don't know if I should tell my boyfriend. What would you do? - Well let me ask you this. If your boyfriend cheated on you, would you want to know? - Hell Yeah. - Then maybe that's your answer. - I gotta tell Jacob; it's driving me nuts. - What if he breaks up with you? - It's not my fault; it's that damn pill. - Maybe. - The fuck you mean maybe? - Look, don't get snippy with me. You guys haven't exactly been, you know. - What? - You have been complaining about this relationship for a long time. - Yeah I know, babe. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be a bitch. Maybe that's more a reason I need to come clean with him. Maybe. I can't wait until I get it over with. Would you mind if I leave? There's not much going on. - Sure Honey, go ahead. I can handle it here. - Thank you, Babe; I owe you one. Fish? Fish, are you here? Fish? Fish, I... - Wow. Wow. I guess it makes us even now. - What did you say? - Look, I'm sorry, okay. I was drunk. Hey lady, you can come out now, it's okay. - Did you fucking cheat on me? - Look, I'm not mad at you, okay. We had a rough patch. We both fucked up; let's just forget about this. Yo lady, it's okay to come out, really. Okay, I'm going to leave right now. By the time I come back, that slut has to be gone, okay? - Oh ho ho, now you call me a slut, huh? - Wait Sweetie Puss, don't make this harder, okay? - Fucking bitch, what about you? Oh you're not the holy Athena now anymore, are you? - Woah, woah! Shut up, Sweetie Puss. - You said you wanted to break up with her anyway, didn't you? - You fucking, conniving asshole! And you, Helen, you fucking traitor! I'm going to fucking kill you both! - Woah, woah. - And you, Helen! - Oh my god. - Woah! Woah! Oh my god! - I'm done with you both. I'm through, you hear me! I'm done! - Excuse me, miss. Sorry to interrupt you. Is this place occupied? - Sure, I don't own this bench. You can sit if you'd like. - You are so kind. Most people are so detached, so self-contained. They're even afraid of us involuntarily but not you. You are a ray of light in this dark world. - Thanks. - What a wonderful day it is today, isn't it? - Yes it is. - I've been on these hooves all day, and they're so dry. I'm sorry, may I offer you some lotion? - No thanks. - It's very important to take care of your body and your soul too of course. - Absolutely. Well, I gotta go; have a wonderful day. - Young lady? Thank you so much. You are a wonderful lady. May all your wishes come true in your life. Can you believe your own sister would do something like that? - Well, if I had one and she did, I'd rip her heart out, barbecue it and eat it like a pork chop. Look, I can't understand exactly what you're going through, but Helen really disappointed me too. I had no idea she could be such a treacherous person. - Holy moly! Are these from you? - Yeah. - They're freaking amazing; you never showed me. You're so talented. - I don't know. I guess. Did I tell you I started again. - Actually no, but that's awesome. - Since I had so much energy and I couldn't sleep for the past few weeks, I've been working so crazy. - Yeah, but you don't have any headaches. - True, that's the only reason I'm still taking those freaking pills. How about you and I, we do a show together and you will say yes. - What? - You have to start taking risks, otherwise nothing will happen. - What I want to know about is Victor. How was it? - He's cute, but he's more of a loner. - What I mean is did you guys, you know? - No, he's very reserved. I would say very conservative, but a very very good friend, an unfuckable friend. I need to get over Jacob. The only way is through my pussy. Ah, I need a drink and a fuck. Let's go to a bar. - Oh Honey, I'm so tired and I'm really not in the mood. - Alright, well I'm gonna go change, and don't wait up for me. ♫ Turned on by a sigh ♫ Mona Lisa Mona Lisa ♫ Smile and be quiet ♫ Mona Lisa pull your hand ♫ Up escape the fire ♫ Simple hands simple hands ♫ Smoothing out clothes ♫ It's so bad it feels good ♫ Dark and stormy night ♫ Push your luck ♫ Push your luck ♫ In the grandest style ♫ Born to be wild ♫ With these simple hands ♫ Simple hands - She was even more beautiful in real life. - I can only imagine. - Yeah, she was the kindest, warmest person I ever met. Victor, Victor fell apart after she died. He hasn't been in a relationship since. - What do you mean? - Charlotte, his wife, after she died of a brain tumor. Oh, you didn't know? - Oh course I knew. - Excuse me. - Hi, Theo. - Hi. - You have a voice like an angel. - Oh, you do too. And you're beautiful too. - Well, thank you. - I'm so stupid. - No, don't be silly. - I just don't feel comfortable talking about her. I know it's no excuse, but she was the love of my life, and when she passed, I just fell into this deep, dark place. - I really understand, Victor. I was just a bit surprised when he told me. I'm so sorry about your loss; I really am. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - You like creepy stuff, right? - How did you know? - You wanna go on a trip tomorrow? - Where to? - You'll see. - Sure, I'd like to see what you label creepy Nothing with human flesh and chains. Holy fuck, this is awesome! This is really a nice surprise. I had a feeling you'd like it. And why was this closed? Well you know, so many places like this one were closed because of, you know, patient abuse and overcrowding, unsafe building materials. - I read once; it all started with JFK's sister, had a lobotomy, right? - Exactly, exactly. Right after Rosemary Kennedy was lobotomized and then JFK started looking into places like this, you know, and shutting them down. He was for deinstitutionalization really. He just wanted to get people out of places like this one and put 'em into more humane locations. - De-Instinctive, what a word. And meds help too. - Of course, but antidepressants weren't introduced until the 50s or 60s, and that helped out a lot. I just love visiting places like this, you know, where people lived and died. I don't know why I'm so attracted to them. - I just can't stand this. It seems if you don't have a big, successful life, you're a failure. You read it everywhere. You know, you have to make career, money, get married, stay buff. Once I read an article, you have to be stupid not to strive for happiness. - But I mean who defines happiness? Society? And by the way, who defines what's the right way to live? That's how I felt about my old job. Everything was money, success all the time. - We can go further: success is happiness. This is why I feel so bad for today's kids. Everyone wants to be musician or actor. Everyone wants to be rich and famous. - There was time when people were happy just opening a little business in the town they were born in, maybe like a little bakery, had children. They got married; that was it. - Exactly, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Why can't people be happy with a modest life. - Yeah, let less; you know, a little less, but more quality of life. Maybe there would be fewer divorces, you know, more people spending time with their children instead of their lovers. I'll be going away on a trip soon. Oh really? Where to? - I don't know, I've traveled most of the world, but I've never been to Russia or China, so I'm thinking of doing he Trans-Siberian Express. - By train? - Yeah, it leads outta Moscow, right; goes right through Mongolia straight into Pyongyang. - Wow, that sounds mind-blowing. You know, I would love to travel. It's not like I've been anywhere, but I actually never left the US. I always dreamed of Europe: Paris, Rome, Madrid, Amsterdam. How long will you be gone for? - I don't like to rush when I travel. I like to take in every little detail, you know, the people, the food, the culture, so I'm thinking I don't know, about a year. - Oh wow. I will miss you. I could never do a trip like that. No money, job. I take daily care of my mom. She can barely walk or move. - And you take care of her alone? - Yeah, I go there every evening; sometimes during the day before my shift. You know, I love her; it doesn't bother me. - That is really honorable of you. - Well, it's a freaking modest life that we were talking about right? Incredibly satisfying. You wanna come upstairs? - That was a wonderful kiss, the best I had in a long time. - Thank you. - But the truth is that I'm not ready yet. I mean honestly, I feel stupid saying no to a beauty like you, but I, I just need more time. I hope you're not disappointed. - How could I, Victor? You're a rare gentleman. I actually never met anyone like you. Thank you for a wonderful day. I really enjoyed every second of it. - Ha, you're in love! - No way! I don't know, he's strange. We didn't even fuck yet. - Well, maybe that's a good thing. You know, touch a person's soul before you touch their body. That's the way it's supposed to be, right? - In your fairy fantasy world where having sex means to stroke the wings of each other. I mean cum shot means sprinkling some fairy dust or some shit. - Just make fun of me 'cause your own love life is so wonderful, right? - I don't need douchebags; I just want their cocks. - That's exactly medicine I need right now. - Well, go and get it; what's the issue? - A couple of days ago, a stranger approached me on the street. - And? - He asked me if I was the girl that likes to fuck. - What? - And then he asked if I wanna fuck him. - Oh holy shit, you are officially the number one Jersey City whore. - What did you say? - I slapped him in the face. - Fuck yeah, and then? - Well, I was horny. What else was I supposed to do? - No, you did not! You are crazier than I thought. - For the past few weeks, I fucked so many guys, I went from tampon regular to ultra. I think I need to go incognito, like wear some big glasses and a wig, and maybe grow a beard. - You are killing me. - I'm going to open an online dating account and start dating guys from there. - Will you wear your dark glasses when you fuck? - Hell yeah, it's not like I wanna see their stupid faces anyhow. - So, if I may ask, is it too bright in here? - Actually, yes; I'm sorry. I have an eye disease and-- - I'm sorry to hear that. It's just, I mean I wish I could see your eyes, you know. - Yeah right, like you really wanna see that and not this. - Okay, I mean, they're really nice too but, you wanna order something? - How could you possibly do something so off-the-charts? I mean with her sister? Come on! - Thanks, you don't have to rub it in my face, alright. - But it's hopefully over now, right? - Athena doesn't answer the phone, texts, nothing. - Ah man, you are incredible. Anyhow, we have to end our experiment. This is taking too long. - The things we did, man. You should have seen that; she was a fucking machine. - And the dream is over. We have to finish this now, do you hear me? We can't continue this placebo experiment. It's unethical and wrong. Finished, okay? - No man, I mean are you crazy? Nobody got hurt, right? It was just a sugar pill. No man, and going back to a no sex life, Hell no. You should've seen her, man. It was a fucking dream, alright? The things we did, hahaha. No, no no. - Are you okay? - Oh my fucking god. - Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. I'm such a clumsy daisy. - Hey! - It didn't hurt? - Stop, lady! - It didn't hurt? You motherfucker! You piece of shit asshole! Didn't hurt? - Oh my god. You, You! - Get up, bitch! It's time to fuck! Okay Fish, stick it in and fuck me as hard as you can. - Okay, can you help me out here? - What? I didn't know some - You either fuck me in a minute, or I'm out, okay, bitch? - Alright, alright. Alright, just give me a second, alright? - Give me a second, a second; I'm almost done. - Athena? Athena, you okay? Athena? Come on, come on, let's go up. It was all fake. - I don't know what you're talking about. Athena, I'm not sure this is a really good idea, okay. - Right now, this is the only thing I'm sure about. - Jeez, I mean I don't know what to say. What they did to you is really disgusting. Are you gonna sue them? - No. - Why not? I mean what they did is pretty much a crime. - Oh, I have some nice ideas for payback. Suing would be too easy for those idiots. - And they surely deserve it. Will you let me know what you're gonna do to them? - It depends. - Mmm, on what? - On how nice you're going to be with me. - Come with me. - What do you mean? - On the trip, come with me. Join me. - You're crazy; you know I don't have money. - Forget about the money, okay. I'll take care of everything. I'll even hire the best nurses to take care of your mother. - Yes, but what happens when I come back? I don't have a job and I probably don't have an apartment, and I'll have to start from the beginning. - Look, I'm 100 % sure I want you to come with me on this trip, okay, and I can take care of you for years to come until you get back on your feet, even for the rest of your life. I mean-- - Let's not argue and just enjoy the moment. - We sent the invitations out too, right? - Yep, everything is organized. It's all, no worries. - I don't think I'm gonna make it to the opening. - Oh, stop it. You'll see, everything will be wonderful. Besides, it's always hard for the first time. Eww. - What? - Hey, Susan. - Hmmph! - Hey, Sweetie Puss. - What the fuck do you want? - Sweetie Puss, listen. You gotta give me a minute, alright? I don't have the words to express the pain and the anguish, okay. You know, with that Helen stuff and that other thing, even if my intentions were right, I fucked up, okay. - That other thing? You fucking asshole! Do have any idea what I went through when I found out, huh? You motherfucker! - I can't imagine, okay, and that's why I'm so sorry. - What do you think this is? A cheesy romantic comedy? You come here with flowers and chocolates and it's all hunky dory, we're gonna live happily 'til the end of our fucking lives? - Listen, you're angry, okay, and the thing with Helen, that was just an escape. - An escape? An escape to her warm, cozy, rotten cunt! - It's over, okay. I finished it; I love you, and only you, okay. You gotta believe me. Listen, I understand what I did, okay, and that's why I went into fucking hyper mode and really thought about my actions, alright. - I'm still so confused about this entire fucking thing. My life right now is fucked up. - I know, Sweetie; that's why you gotta give me a second chance, alright. It will all be different now. - If you're expecting an answer right now, you're wrong. - Sweetie Puss, I love you, okay. I'll wait forever; just please, think about it, okay? - I would love to pull his ball sack around his silly neck and strangle him, but that's just me. - That's actually an interesting image. - But what about this Victor guy? He sounds intriguing, somebody I'd root for. - Actually, he's a real darling. So do you feel something for him? Love? - That's the thing. I'm so confused; my feelings are all mixed up. - Darling, you are a wonderful, beautiful, very strong woman. It's time you fought back all those people who messed with you and take control of your life, and enjoy life with somebody who really appreciates you for exactly who you are. Call him; what are you waiting for? - I don't know. Damn, why doesn't he just call me? - Well, because Theo's probably as timid as you are. - God, isn't that a match? - Well, we invited him to the opening, right, and if he shows up, that will be the indication if he's interested or not. Holy fuck! - Have you seen the devil? - Yes. - Wait, really? - Oh come on, Susan. - No, I better not say anything.` - Stop being so over-dramatic and fuck, just say it. - Okay, well I saw Jacob. - Well, I guess that's unavoidable. Jersey City's not a big place. - And he wasn't alone. - No, don't say it. Yes. - No. - Yes, he was with that cunt, Helen. - What? Motherfucker, really? - Embracing and kissing and all that shit. - You know what, that's it! I'm done, okay. I'm gonna go pay a visit to someone special. - I would not wanna be that somebody. - Do you think she's going to Helen or Jacob? - No idea; I wouldn't want to be either of them. - You can't come in; he's got a patient. - We need to talk now! - God damn it Athena, are you out of your fucking mind? Mr Bleaker, didn't I tell you to take a laxative. God damn it! Are you completely nuts? What the fuck are you doing? - You'd better shut the fuck up after what you did to me. You're going to do something for me now. You're going to do the same thing to Jacob you did to me. - What? - You are going to give Jacob a placebo pill. - He won't fall for it, not after, well, you know why. He's not that stupid. - Oh, he will; you will convince him. You will call him for yearly checkup exam and then you're gonna tell him he has brain tumor. - You're nuts. No fucking way; I'm not gonna do it. - Oh, I'm going to go to press. I'm going to tell your wife. After I'm done with you, I will not be surprised if they won't let you practice on some fucked up Guinea pigs. Oh, and this is not all, my dear Max. After you tell him he ha brain cancer, you are going to tell him that you have an experimental pill for him. - How am I gonna convince him that he's got cancer? - Oh, you fucking convinced me, right? He's your friend; he'll trust you. Just take some x rays from a sick person or something, and after that, you are going to tell him about serious side effects. I don't know guys, I feel really stupid. All this makeup, this dress, these heels. It's not me. I don't even know if Theo's gonna show up. Oh stop it, babe. - Theo hi, thank you for coming. - Namaste, thank you so much for the invitation really. Wow, you are a talented photographer. I love what I'm seeing. - Oh, you're so cute. Thank you, but I don't know if it's true. - Of course it's true. Really, you are truly blessed. I love what I'm seeing, and Athena, I love your collages. I really do. - Thanks Theo, you're too kind. Did you come with Victor? - I haven't seen him all week, but I am sure he's going to show. - Well, enjoy the show and other beautiful views. - Wow, I am so impressed by your work. The colors, the composition, incredible. - Hey guys, I'm so glad you can make it. Well, thanks for the invite. - I'm not sure if you were serious in your text. This is not a joke, right? - As I wrote, we're okay. Besides, I think you guys are a better couple than we ever were. - Okay, I guess so. - I have something for you. I made this for you. What is it? - Your favorite cucumber salad. Your favorite I made just for you. - You're joking. What is this? The help? You didn't shit in it, right? - Don't be silly. Who wouldn't taste shit in the pie? That seems so ridiculous anyway. - Yeah, maybe later. - I made it just for you as a sign of peace. - Okay, I guess so. Wow, its really good. Thanks, Athena. - You're very welcome. Enjoy the show; will you excuse me? - Hey Fish, I'm so glad you made it. - Babe, I wouldn't miss this show for anything. How you guys doing? - Very good. I didn't sell anything, but Susan did. - That's awesome, I'm so glad for you guys, and you'll sell a collage soon. I can't wait to see your artwork. Damn, you look so damn breathtaking. I just came to tell you something. - I love you. - I know; I feel the same way. I mean, I love you too. - I'm sorry, I interrupted you. - I just wanted to tell you that I'll be leaving soon. - Oh. - You know, the trip. - When? - In about a month, and I got you a ticket too. From New York to Paris. See, I thought that since you've never been to Europe, we can start our trip in Paris and then, we can spend some time in Europe and visit the major cities and then go to Moscow. And then from there, we can take the Trans-Siberian Express. I mean, look, to be honest, I'm just not sure that I wanna live without you. Ever since we had our night together, I can't stop thinking about you. - Can you wait here for a second? - Sure. - Actually, there's something else you can do for me. - Okay, what? - You're gonna watch Mom while I'm gone. - No Athena, you know I have-- - You owe me one. - Okay, yeah. - Are you nervous? - No, not really. Excited. You know, it's been a long time since I left JC. I think I'm gonna miss it. - Now I don't know about that. - Nice day today isn't it, sir. Do you think you can spare a-- - Fuck you! - What's so funny? - Nothing. I just had a thought about Jacob. - Okay. - Oh, it's not like that. I organized a little payback. - I see. You did mention something about revenge. You are a little devil after all, aren't you? - No. Maybe a little. - You okay? - Yeah fuck me, Stud!
