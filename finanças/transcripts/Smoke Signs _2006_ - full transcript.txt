SMOKE SIGNS A Journey Through Time - The Future It's the end of the world. Why has she holed up here? You should have let the taxi wait. - Why? - Annabella doesn't take every guest. - Are there no vacant rooms? - Sure. But did you make a reservation? I thought it wouldn't be necessary at this time of year. I'm Joe. From Florida. I'm Leila and I'll be right back. I'll get Annabella. Wait here. How are you today? I love grubbing about in the earth. A new guest arrived. His name's Joe, from Florida, but he speaks perfect German. I hope he won't cause any trouble. I'm busy. Tell him to wait. I'll be there in a couple of hours. You can offer him a drink! Are you a guest or do you belong to the house? It's beautiful here. Very beautiful. Are there many people here in the summer? It's a bit off the beaten track. No. I "schpeak" only German. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. Bloody Americans, you think you own the world. Where's Hans? He left. I think he can't stand me. He's not a great talker. Don't worry about it. Annabella is busy. She says, you're to wait. Okay, I'll wait. Would you like a drink? Yes, but I'd prefer a bed. I've been on the road for 20 hours. I'm dead tired. What if Annabella doesn't take you? I'll fall asleep right here. Are there other hotels in the area? We're a guesthouse, not a hotel. You don't make it easy for your guests. You'll have to get used to it. - Did you catch something? - Lots. I just kept the biggest. Let's see! There'll be fresh fish for dinner. I used to fish too. - Who's that? - A new guest. I'm Jonathan. But you can call me Joe. I'll get you something to drink. Better not touch me. You'll get your lovely suit dirty. - Armani? - Fischer. Jonathan Fischer. Oh, you mean my suit. No, my thoughts are half in bed. Come in the house. You'll need to fill out a rather extensive form first. Even if I only stay a couple of days? Is that your luggage? Don't bother. You have to fill out the form first. I'm not sure I can have you as a guest. Hallo, Jade. Can you wait a moment? I have to take care of a guest. Please sit down and take your time. I'll take a shower and change. Your mother isn't here. She'll be back tomorrow or the day after. Michael arrived yesterday. My God, why do you want to know all this? That's for your mother to decide. I don't want to interfere. I think you should be here the day after tomorrow, as planned. See you the day after tomorrow. My financial assets... ...my sleeping habits, how in the hell should I know! My sexual preferences... I've answered the questions as best I can. You live up to your name. You look enchanting! - Did you think up these questions? - No. My partner wants it this way. She's not here right now. She's buying wine for the summer season. It reads like the application form for a marriage agency. Sometimes she marries a guest. She loves marrying... and usually gets divorced just as fast. And you? - Me? - Are you the same? Me, no! I must love a man. Do you believe in love? Yes. My experience hasn't been good. The women I met only wanted my money. Mr. Fischer. Your plate, please! I feel like I've been here for days. To the paradise at the end of the world! Your health, Annabella! May I call you Annabella? When's breakfast? I'm dying of hunger. In half an hour! I slept like a bear... ...and I had a wonderful dream. Will you tell me what you dreamt? I hope it was a serious dream. You were with me the whole night. In my dream. I'll get the coffee. Guesthouse "Bella Sardegna"... Oh, it's you. Who do you want to speak to? Your mother's isn't here. Okay, I'll let them know you've changed your plans again and are arriving today. I'll write it down... Jade called. She's arriving today. You should pick her up. That's very inconvenient. It's the new moon today. I must plant the olive trees. I have no time! Perhaps I can be of use? I can help plant the trees or pick Jade up at the airport, or both, if you'll lend me your car. Have you ever planted olive trees? I could say yes because I'd like to do it with you. But then I'd be a liar. And I don't want to lie to you. Ever! Can you find your way to the airport? Do you even have a driver's licence? I have a wonderful valid American licence. Alright! - "Alright" what? - Both. Good. That's deep enough. Just a minute. No, not yet. A woman who knows a lot about gardening once told me... that you don't pour water in the hole... so the roots... develop better. Perhaps at home in Florida. Not here. Were you in love with her? A bit. It's fun working with you. Do you find me entertaining? No, no. Do I talk too much? Help! I had a bite. Wonderful. Now, lift the tip slowly, so that the fish comes closer... and when you lower it wind in the line. Always do that, or the line will break. Lift it up. Where were you? I missed you at breakfast. Don't disturb me! Can't you see I've got a fish on the line. Lift it again. - Is that right? - Wonderful. If it runs off to the left, counter, and move in the other direction. I'm Jade and who are you? Annabella was busy, so I offered to come. Do you have a name? You can call me Joe. I can't believe it. You look so different. I didn't imagine you this way. Are you 100 percent sure I'm your daughter? To be honest... no. Why did you leave and never contact us? Strictly speaking, your mother left me. She upped and left one day without leaving a note. With you. We called you Moon then. You were so small. Keep your hands on the wheel, Joe. I don't want to die yet! I just can't imagine that you're my father. I feel the same way. But you're nice. At least that's something. - He says he's my father. - What? He says he's my father, but his name is Fischer and mine is Goldberg... and he used to call his daughter Moon. It all pretty strange. Wait until your mother arrives. She's bound to know more. What do you think of him? I think he's okay. I do too. What's the matter with you? You look as if you're afraid? It was the same last year. In the summer holidays. It's a complicated story. Do you really want to hear it? Some of my people are fighting those who believe in another God. I fought along with them because my boyfriend did. I loved him very much. He's dead now and I ran away. I'm afraid they'll find me. But you only followed him. Or did you kill someone? No, but they think I could betray them. Don't you know how to cover your tracks? Sure. But what I know, they know. You could hide in our cave. What do they look like? I mean, if they come. I don't know. They won't come with tanks and soldiers. They come quietly and by night. Sooner or later they'll find me. Nobody will find you here, but I'm glad you told me. You're really courageous. I'm not. I'm afraid. Sitting in front of the TV again? TV makes you stupid! TV is shit. You know I watch cinema. I am the god of cinema. Cinema will live only as long as I do. Because I love it. More than anything else in the world. You're not a god. You're drunk. But I'm still fond of you. Even if you do stink of alcohol. Gods never stink of alcohol! Have you got some new films? Loads. I wanted to build my house here, but I couldn't get building permission. It's almost like the Rocky Mountains. This is my favourite place. This is where I look at the moon. Sometimes I come when it's dark and sleep up here. Did you know I was an astronaut and I walked around up there on the moon? Such a long time ago. I love Hölderlin's poems. My Hölderlin poetry book is up there now. I "forgot" it there on purpose, so I can see it from here. Would you mind if I fell in love with you? No. Shall we use "du"? You're so familiar to me, as if we'd always known one another. We must kiss first. That shouldn't be a problem. I love you. That's Isabella. Stay seated, please! I'll look after her. Mama, a man has arrived. He says he's my father. His name is Jonathan Fischer. I don't want to see that bastard. Send him away! It's not that simple. Where's the problem? Is he my father? Yes! Unfortunately. That man ruined the best years of my life. I'm leaving. He should go back where he came from. Mama, you're so unfair. I'm going to Joe, to tell him he's my father. I have something to say. Don't tell me you've fallen in love with him? You look so happy! My God! How could you! - How long has he been here? - Two days. You'll have to explain this. How is it possible that in two days... you could fall in love with a complete stranger... who, in addition, is a complete swine? Love at first sight. It happens. I still don't want to see him. I'm driving over to the house. I need to sleep on it. I'm going to watch Citizen Kane this evening. Would you like to watch it with me? Yes, but only if you keep quiet while we watch it. I'll be as silent as the grave. Your ex-wife doesn't want to see you. She still hates you. - She wants me to send you away. - She can't do that! Joe, I have so much to tell you. Promise me you'll never leave again! Okay. Your mother was always very impulsive. The world will look different tomorrow. I also want to talk to you. Personally, I wouldn't mind if Joe left. He's really disturbing the peace here. That's not Isabella. Maybe a new guest. Good evening, Giorgio. It's nice of you to pass by again. How's your family? How's business? Breakfast is from nine, but you know that. Here's your key. Room 4. Sleep well! The film was wonderful. I'm dead tired. I need to sleep. Leila... do you know that I love you? That I've always been madly in love with you? I'm so terribly afraid for you. - Why are you afraid for me? - I know everything. Here, I'll defend you with this. It's loaded. It's only a shotgun, but if anyone wants to harm you, I'll blow them away! You're completely drunk. You drink much too much wine. I'm going to bed. Come sit beside me. You mustn't think I used to beat her. Would you kiss me? Actually, I don't want to know anything. I know everything about you anyway. Up there on the moon I understood everything... ...about life and the world here on earth... ...that was suddenly so far away. A philosopher once said... ...I can't remember his name... ...Georg Picht... ...knowledge is only possible from a distance. I want to sit on your lap and fuck you. I have nothing on under my dress. You never loved me! You always wanted me to be different than I am! I was lead singer of the "Contradictions" and you simply had to have me. And you got me, because I wanted you too. You were so in love with me, so crazy about me that I could only love you too. Then we lived together and married. Then Moon came... and for one moment I was really happy with you. Then you began to change. You wanted everything to be the way you imagined it should be. I played no part in it. Why is Moon now called Jade? I hated you because you constantly cheated on me! I wanted to erase all memory of you, of our love! Can you understand that? Why on earth did you have to fall in love with my best friend? Do you think I planned it? I came here. It happened. You haven't changed one bit. I see it will be a very difficult summer for us all. I don't hate you. On the contrary. Let's try to be reasonable. Moon loves me and she accepted me as her father straight away. Women all love you. That's the awful thing. Have you seen my father? Who's your father? I don't know him. Everything okay? Those who plant trees must think of the future. Will you embrace me? I always think of the future. But when I feel good, as I do now, I forget everything. There you are. I've been looking all over. Come, I have to show you something. Look, Michael and I furnished it. We kissed here the first time. We want to marry when we're older. - Welcome! - Has my brother arrived? - No, Josef hasn't... - I'm Josef. Günter... No, you're the first. - Do we have the same room as always? - Of course. - I don't need to show you anything. - No. See you later. This is the third time you're here. I don't know why, but I always have a strange feeling in my stomach when you're around. Perhaps you should see a doctor. Don't get funny, all right! And keep away from Leila! I warn you. He's the biggest egoist I've ever met. Is he at least good in bed? I love his dick. It's simply wonderful and so... ...long! I'd like to cut off his dick with this knife! I'll kill you if you do. Maybe he took some kind of penis-elongation pills. In my day it was rather small. Come and see the joy about us; in cooling airs do fly the branches of the glade, as curls in a dance; and as on a resounding lyre A pleasing spirit, the sky, plays with rain and sunshine on the earth; As in loving dispute over the sound of the lyre a thousand fold swarming of fleeting tones astir, shadow and light wander in sweet melodic succession above the mountains the heaven had softly touched with silver drops his brother, the river, Now he is near And pours his precious load, which he bore by his heart Over the glade and the river, ...and the greening of the glade, and heaven's image in the river fades and disappears before us. And the lonely mountain's peak... ...with the hills and rocks, which he hides in his peak... the hills resting around him, like lambs And in blooming bushes as wrapped in tender wool, refresh themselves from the mountain's clear cooling springs, And the steaming valley with its seeds and flowers The garden before us, Near and far flees, Loses itself in joyful confusion, and the sun dies. But the streams of heaven rushed by And purified, rejuvenated goes the earth with the blessed children from the bath More joyful, more alive shines the green of the glade and more golden gleam the flowers. - That's beautiful. - Yes. Wonderful. Our German teacher once told us... that he recited Hölderlin poems when he walked with a girl he was in love with. And "reading-Hölderlin" became our secret expression for love-walks. I always wanted to construct a pond here. A large pond one can swim in. I love water. I would love to have a house by the sea. I have a house by the sea. Come with me to Florida! I can't just drop everything here. Or I'll build you a pond. I've built many ponds. Say yes and I'll start tomorrow. You're crazy. Everyone who loves is crazy. - What's the matter? - You sleep so loudly. Could you please go to your room. Yes. - Can I have your torch? - Of course. Sleep well. What are you doing here? You belong in bed. I'm guarding the house. We're not in the Wild West. You've seen too many American films with Hans. Good night. Sleep well. Joe, has my mother fallen in love with you? You should ask her. Okay? I will. I think it's good. - Good night. - Sleep well. Careful, Joe! There's a swamp. The path is back there. Why aren't you still asleep? You're on holiday. I didn't sleep the whole night. I think Michael's fallen in love with Leila. He pays no attention to me anymore. I might as well be invisible. Michael is much too young for Leila. Could you teach me how to kiss really well? I dug a hole here. Just to see what the ground is like. It looks pretty good. I placed a marker here. And I thought 20 meters in this direction... ...and fifteen up there. That would be a good size for a pond. The best thing about a pond is what it reflects. The sun, the moon, the mountains, the trees... ...the landscape here. Most people don't consider that when they make a pond. - Who does this piece of land belong to? - Me. - Well, Isabella also has a say in the matter. - I am speechless. - Could we swim in the pond? - Of course. Then I'll swim every morning. There's too much algae in the lake. How long will it take? One week, two weeks. It depends on Mr. Erdmann. He has a construction company in Olbia and they'll make the pond. And while the workers are here, can they restore the round house up there? - Of course. - Could I have an estimate by this evening? Just a rough one. A few thousand Euros either way won't matter. - You'll have it this evening. - Fine. - I capitulate. Who's paying for all this? - I am! Who else? You're not getting any money from me. Now I need a car, a phone and a bank account. Who'll drive me to Olbia? I can drive you there, but I have to come back immediately. - Can I come with you? - Of course. Come on! Good luck! Think you can manage? I can say "Buon giorno, grazie, pronto..." That should be enough. Leila, what the hell? What happened? Someone shot me. Look, Mr. Erdmann made love with Mrs. Erdmann again last night. Now I know why she looked so beautiful this morning. Sex makes you beautiful! I need a beauty treatment again. Mama! Someone shot Leila! She needs a doctor right away. It's beautiful here. I'm delighted by your unbureaucratic style. We're never bureaucratic when we like our clients. I still have one little problem, Gabriella. I need a telephone out there. Tomorrow, if possible. I know that's practically impossible!? You'll have a telephone tomorrow. - I'm hungry! - You're a wonderful woman. Tell them we will make a fire. They'll see the smoke from far away. - What's wrong? - I don't know. Something terrible! Leila's been shot. Come and help us! We need as much wood as possible. - We need paper to get it going. - Dry grass will do. Leila, are you dead? Stop crying! We need more wood! We must make smoke. I'm starving. Maybe Mama's right. You're a real lady-killer. Then we must eat right away. Do you know a good restaurant? Anything's fine. We should call your mother, so she doesn't worry. Nobody answers. Doesn't matter. But if I don't eat right now, I'll die of hunger. Young ladies don't die that fast. I know, I only said it so you'd know how hungry I am. I like to exaggerate. I want to be a writer. So it's necessary to exaggerate. I'm not so sure you're right about that. I think it's a bit more complicated to be a writer. You saved my life. I'm eternally grateful. She fell from the rocks into the water and didn't move. At first I thought she was joking. Then the water turned red and I jumped in and pulled her out. Tell him, it was completely silent. There was no sound of a shot. Why are the police here? It's me, Jade. Someone shot Leila. Oh God! Is she dead? We don't know anything yet. A helicopter is taking her to hospital. You swine! - Did you put out the fire? - Of course. We've already had two forest fires here. - Is Leila dead? - Yes. Hans has shot himself in Giorgio's room. His brain is splattered all over the walls. Awful. He saw it through the window. Promise me it won't change anything for us. I promise. I not only sleep and snore like a bear, I'm also as strong as a bear. You give me courage, my love. I'm so desperate. Love is stronger than anything else in the world. Why are you doing that? I like to measure things. It helps. And why do you need a weather station? Are you secretly planning night-flights to the moon? I was Professor of Meteorology at the TU in Berlin. You should really call me Professor. You constantly astound me, Professor. What are they doing? The company is going to erect a large tent for me. It will be my headquarters. It'll vibrate for a few days and then all will be quiet again. I've warned the company... ...that they must remove all tire tracks and rubbish immediately. So don't worry. My brother is arriving today. I wouldn't hold it against you if you moved your family reunion to a quieter place. We're staying. First of all, it's a tradition. Second, I have something to do here, I'm earning money, and third, life goes on. Without death there would be no life. My father always said: Life and death belong together like water and cement. You're a philosopher. I have both feet planted firmly on the ground. Or I wouldn't be where I am. Hans couldn't have killed Leila. He loved her. But our Giorgio disappeared without a trace after the murder. At least he always professed to be a businessman. Jealousy? Hans and Leila got on well. They watched films together. An international warrant? She inherited a fortune from her mother. She had a numbered account in Switzerland and she left it all to Michael. I found a will in her room. You have no right to it. It's true. In a murder case he does. The will contains precise details of how to access the money. If I give him the will, he'll fly to Zurich and withdraw it all! I have little faith in the Italian authorities. We are not in Italy, but in Sardinia. And with due respect, don't underestimate the capabilities of us Sards. Certainly not. The two ISDN-cables are to go in the tent as soon as it's ready. I intend to transfer my American headquarters here. Is that possible? No problem. I laid a cable out here last year. You can talk to America this evening. Are you really going to do that? Of course. I always plan way ahead. That's my principle in life. - Mine too. I inherited that from you. - Yes, you have it from me. You're my daughter. I'm going fishing. I really need some peace. You know my daughter. I just wanted to drop by and see if it all worked out with the telephone. - It works perfectly. I just tested it. - Good. - They are the same rooms as last year. - Thanks. Is my brother already here? - Yes, they're here. Have a good stay! - Thank you. Professor, may I introduce my bank director. Delighted. Please call me Gabriella. I am a friend of your husband. He's not my husband. You both... you are so well-matched. Gabriella, I have a problem. Banks are there to solve problems. Good. My son has inherited a lot of money. It's in a numbered account in Switzerland. Could you open an account for him here and have the money transferred? I can certainly open an account for your son... ...but I can't touch the money in Switzerland. - You'll have to fly there in person. - I can't get away at the moment. Perhaps I can take care of that for you. I know how to talk to bank directors. Yes. You have an account in Switzerland? I didn't hear a thing. I am banking secrecy personified. My ship was on the way from Australia to Tahiti. We hit the worst storm I had ever experienced. - All the passengers were seasick. - You too? A captain is never seasick. When the storm passed, everybody was hanging over the rails, throwing up. Their faces were green. And suddenly the biggest shark I've ever seen was on our line. It needed ten sailors to pull it on board. No wonder. The vomit attracted it. I do the same when I fish. Only I use fish food. I hope the pond will be ready before the Easter holidays are over. I must stock it with fish. I have to tell you something. But nobody's supposed to know. - So keep it to yourself, okay? - No problem. My father wants to marry your mother. - My mother was always pretty crazy. - She doesn't know yet. Stop it. It's ridiculous for people over forty to marry. They're already half dead. Except for my mother, of course. What if we got married? I mean, we're young! - You're just fifteen. - I mean, when I'm eighteen. What are you doing there? I have to pee everywhere. To safeguard it. Like a cat. I did the same when I bought the property. I marked all the important spots. You never cease to amaze me. Do you think it will ever again be the way it was? I swear it will be as beautiful as it was before. Maybe you're the prince I dreamt about when I was a girl. And you're my princess. No, Leila is a princess. An Arab princess. - Did I tell you that? - No. You will come back? What a question! Of course. You're my princess and I'm your knight. I can't do otherwise. I must return to you, or I will die. Yes. It wasn't a good idea to drive me here. I won't have a car when I return. I wanted to. Maybe your plane will crash or be skyjacked by terrorists. I have no intention of dying. Death is so close now. And the catastrophes in the news are no longer improbable or unreal. Don't say Baby to me. I say that to all women, so I don't confuse their names. You can do what you want with me, but don't say Baby to me, okay! You mean, she knew she would die here? I believe so. Her will says she wanted to be buried here. We could bury Hans and Leila side by side. Maybe in the earth beneath the pond. Why not! The bulldozer is here anyway. That way we can kill two birds with one stone, and quickly. Then we won't have any graves to tend and we can quickly forget them both. That's a good solution. I don't know whether I'll still be able to swim in the pond. You don't have to. You're just too sentimental. That tastes good. The Erdmanns will be pleased. Do you think the priest will agree? I'll take care of that. The more I think about it, the better I like the idea. Then it will be a holy pond. As you like. I just need a man. I feel like a dog on heat. Everything's all swollen. Where? Your love story with my husband makes me crazy. I'm almost a little jealous. You have no right to be. He's your ex-husband! I know one shouldn't say this... ...but somehow I'm happy Leila isn't here anymore. Concentrate on fishing, man! Is the money in there? No. The money is already in Michael's new bank account. I brought you this from Zurich. You're crazy! Yes. Now go and try it on! What you don't like, we'll send back. How do you know my size so well? I know you inside and out. But, just to be sure, I took one of your dresses. Which wasn't so easy. And then I had to find someone in Zurich who had your figure. And? A beautiful young woman. She tried everything on. And how beautiful was this beautiful young woman? Very beautiful. You are a womanizer, Isabella is right. But you are my womanizer! I love you, do you know that? Yes. Tomorrow is the funeral. Yes. He says, the funeral today was a memorable occasion. He was deeply moved. But the ways of the Lord are unfathomable. And he strongly believes in that. It's full moon the day after tomorrow. I thought it would be a good moment for you. If you wish to be my wife... ...I want to marry you. Is that a proposal of marriage? Yes. I'm not joking. The timing is... ...perhaps not the best. If I was twenty or thirty or forty years old or... ...I would have said yes immediately. No, that's rubbish, that's not true. I'm much more courageous now. I was terribly afraid before I flew to the moon. I was mortally afraid. I played with the idea of leaving the team. I wanted to give up. An engineer from ground personnel realised what was happening. She took me to a woman, a very strange and unusual woman. She was to help me overcome my fear. She spoke to me, for ten minutes or an hour. I lost all sense of time. She spoke of God. Of death. Of love. She said that she loved me. And I felt it physically. Then she gave me this painting. The girl with the golden eyes. Then I wasn't afraid. Of flying to the moon or of anything else. But now I'm a little afraid of marrying you. You're wonderful. There's a full moon tomorrow. Jonathan and I want to get married. Have you any idea how we can manage that quickly? Aren't you rather rushing it? No. The full moon is always good for such things. The weather changes and everything is new. I married once by full moon. Michael's father. And you divorced him. I have the feeling that it's right now. Tomorrow is the right day. There are more full moons to come! Why are you so sure that marrying by full moon is a good thing? I can't say, it just is that way. So you are asking me to help you... ...to marry the man that I divorced? - I thought you'd become wiser. - Why? If we were in America it would be simple. But it takes ages here. I know what I'm talking about. Besides, I don't think the priest will venture out here again. It's working! Yesterday was Hans and Leila's funeral. It was all very sad. And the sun was so hot... ...that sweat ran like tears down our faces. It was the first time I thought about death. I'm afraid I will die without having really lived. Testament. I came here to find my last resting-place. In the case of my death... ...all my possessions shall go to Jade, the daughter of Isabella. Hans Bergschmidt. Sardinia, January 1st... I have the solution! - Hans also left a will. - I have the solution! The solution for what? Günter Erdmann is a captain. And captains can marry people. Did he say that? Here on land? I've spoken to him. He says, it's only possible on his ship out at sea, but my idea is, we could do it on a boat. Logical, isn't it? I feel a bit strange about it. Nobody must know that the marriage didn't take place at sea. I can only sign your marriage certificate on my ship. Then I'll send it to you by post. I'll be as silent as the grave. The pond is full. Come immediately! At last! - Ready? - Yes. You must stand. I will do a short version of the ceremony. I've forgotten the exact text. Annabella, will you marry Jonathan? Yes. Jonathan, will you marry Annabella? Yes. By virtue of my office I now declare you man and wife. Now you must kiss. An equatorial dunking at the same time. Now you're protected against all the adversities of married life. I always imagined my wedding to be like this! Congratulations! That was the best wedding I have ever seen. - That's how it should be, for it to go well. - Thank you. Go and change! I specially hired two cooks for the marriage feast. What have you been doing so long? We're hungry! - You must say something. - I know. I am happy that you are here... ...and I hope you all enjoy the party! To a day that continues as it began! Our wedding night. We met fourteen days ago. It seems like months. So much has happened recently. Will you kiss me? And then?
