Say, Fu... I know... that while I was in the bath... you got yourself off, didn't you? I can tell by the smell. I think I'll go take a bath. Okay. Even though you've been doing it less and less with me. Oh, well. We've been dating for four years, living together for three... I'm turning 32 soon. WAKO'S 32ND BIRTHDAY This lifestyle suits me... Rare things don't happen so easily, anyway. What? But... when you get something rare, you feel like luck has finally found you. EPISODE TWO: "MY OTHER SELF" CINEMA IDEON YUMEAKI IKO We just happen to like the same movie and the same director, that's all. CALL PHONE CALLING YUMEAKI IKO Hello? Oh! Hello, um... This is Wako Taira from the Ideon. Oh, yes. Hello, this is Yumeaki. Um... we found your student ID. Really? I'm so relieved. Thank you so much. I'll come pick it up tomorrow. Huh? Huh? Uh, well, um... The ID was actually in the lost and found box. It seems that I missed it when I looked. I wanted to apologize because you came all that way. Not at all. I'm just glad you found it. I'd like to make up for it somehow... I have tickets forÂ Kagemitsu Okihara's feature event. I happen to have two. I thought maybe I could give it to you... I was thinking of going to that! Oh... I was planning on going too! Would you maybe like to go together? Oh... Um... I figured we'd probably see each other there anyway... Crap... Am I being creepy right now? Are you sure? Yes, of course! I'll e-mail you the details later. Yes. Thank you. I guess you're getting on with your boyfriend despite it all. You're smiling. I am? You're usually complaining about him. You're too nice. I thought you'd just got used to giving in. I'm glad that's not it. I'm not sure if I'd been giving in... but it's true I've just come to accept all that's both good and bad. But... he's the person I've spent the peak of my womanhood with... I can't imagine breaking up with him. Not at this point... Hello? Are you thinking about your boyfriend? Stop that. Besides, that phone call earlier was from a friend, not my boyfriend. -Oh, really? -Yes. She's apparently going to a movie with someone who's not her boyfriend. She was asking, if she was going anyway... whether that would be cheating... I see. I didn't know what to say to that. I see. What do you think, Ms. Mizuno? That's not cheating, is it? Huh? I didn't know how to answer her. It's not cheating... right? Hm... Only the two of them would know what's going on between them. It's up to the boyfriend to decide if it's "cheating" or not. Or, rather... if she thinks it might be cheating, then it probably is. I see. We bought this fan the first day we moved in together. After three years... different parts start to break. See. It's still going strong. We'll be all right, too. I'm taking off! Have a good day. We're just seeing a movie. It'll be okay. Most of the country will be experiencing sunshine today, but areas around Tokyo may get some passing rain in the afternoon. Please close windows to prepare for any sudden rain. And now, today's highs and lows... Northern Japan will experience warmer temperatures today. The highs should probably be about the same as yesterday. Oh, um... before I forget! Thank yo-- I did it again. Is the theater close? I've never been to Shibuya before. I don't know the area at all. Yes, it's right there. I like walking around unfamiliar areas. So, this is fun. I wonder how we look to other people. Are we almost there? Yeah. Yeah? I'm excited. Don't fall asleep today. Not today. If I do, you can hit me. That reminds me... I was pretty shady before. Watching your works, I felt you must have an attachment to the ocean. Was it intentional? Well, oceans have waves... There's a push and pull. Human emotions, too, for example, between two people... There's a push and pull of emotions as well. I'm connecting waves to the movement of emotion between two people. Which is why I always have ocean scenes in my films. Excuse me... May I ask you for an autograph? Thank you! Um... May I shake your hand, too? Of course. -Really? -Sure. I'll hold this for you. Thank you! -Good luck on your projects. -Thanks. -I'll be rooting for you. -I'll do my best. Thank you. You look happy. He had another ocean shot in the end. Yeah, I wonder where it is. I wonder which ocean it is. I'd love to go someday. Oh, I want to tour his film locations. Yeah, that sounds like fun. I'm envious that you work in a movie theater, Ms. Taira. You're in touch with movies every day. You can do anything you want in the future. You're still in high school. Unlike me, you're still totally young. -How old are you, Ms. Taira? -What? I'm 31. You're married, then? No, I'm not marrie-- Are you all right? What the hell? Jesus. Please apologize to her. Huh? Apologize to her! Yumeaki! Let go! Stop making out in the middle of the afternoon. KAGEMITSU OKIHARA THE END OF US That was shocking, earlier. If something had happened to you, I don't know how I'd face your parents. No... You too... Huh? Women should stay back in those situations. What if something terrible happened to you? I'm the one... who wouldn't know how to face your husband. Oh, I don't have a husband! I'm not married. What? Oh? Yeah... I'm single right now... Wait... I don't have anyone like that. I see... Do you want to sing something? What's wrong? Oh, nothing. I'm... suddenly feeling nervous... Nervous? Yes. I've... moved around a lot. So I've never had many friends. And of course, I've never hung out with a woman before... I had so much fun talking with you about movies... It never occurred to me before... but... now I'm realizing how unexpected this situation is. Unexpected? We should dry that. This must be uncomfortable. Your shoulders must ache. Well, I don't wear it at home... In public... I wear it so people don't get too close. So, I try to wear it. I see. Is it inconvenient you can't use your right hand? Yes. For various things... It's off. Ah, don't-- Huh? Um, no... Should we move to the corner? Ms. Taira... the floor is dirty. Yeah... But... But? But... what? Where does the line start... for cheating, again? Ms. Taira... I... can't... -Aoi! -Yes? This is Ms. Mimura. She starts today. You can show her the ropes. Yes, sir. -It's nice to meet you. -It's nice to meet you. Um... Hm? Um... Uh... I... I'm sorry! It'll be okay... I took the laundry inside already. It'll be okay. I've got Fu there, too. I'm home. You look terrible. Like Sadako. Here. Thanks. Mild flavor? Oh, crap. You found me out. You always make it spicy just for me. Aww, I wanted to surprise you when we ate. Too bad. Hey! What are you doing? I can at least make curry, you know? Oh! Crap. I forgot to make the rice. Will you make it? Okay. You got me all wet! Sorry. Oh, so you went to see a movie today? Yeah, it was fun. Alone? No, with the girl I work with at the theater. Oh... The college girl with freckles. Yeah, that's right. This turned out kind of watery. Is it? Don't worry, it tastes good. There aren't many part-timers where you work, though? Was it okay that you both had time off? It was fine. It was only one day, they had coverage. I see. -So then-- -You know the place. The workers are mainly older people. So summer break doesn't really affect them. At worst, one person can run it. This is all that's left of the pickles, so you can finish it. Are you serious? Yes! I'm gonna eat them! Hey, Fu... Let's take a bath together today. Okay. What? -Am I getting the royal treatment today? -Yes, that's right. I've got Fu. No one else's scent... will comfort me anymore. YUMEAKI IKO: MS. TAIRA, CAN YOU TALK NOW? What is there to talk about? But he's only 15... What if he told his parents? I'm sorry I left so suddenly today. I was both embarrassed and sorry, and didn't know what to do. I know this is sudden again, but what are your favorite movies? I want to see you again. What? I was so thirsty it woke me up. What about you? Sleep-talking... You were sleep-talking and I couldn't sleep. What? I think I'm getting hungry again. It's been a while since we were so passionate. What are you saying? You're thirsty, right? What? Are you embarrassed? That reminds me, you were sleep-talking the other day, too. You said you loved me. Just kidding. That's what I figured. I think I'll eat some curry after all. You want some? No, I'm okay. I'm going to use the bathroom. Okay. Good evening, Yumeaki. Please don't worry about it for now. All I can come up with right now are Heartbeats, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Talk to Her, those three. You should try watching them. I'm so full... Maybe I should buy new lingerie...
