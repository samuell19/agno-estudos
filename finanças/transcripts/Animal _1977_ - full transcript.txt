Mademoiselle Jeanne Gardner, do you want to become the wife of Monsieur Michel Gaucher? - Shit! - She has a fever. The insult of civil servant during performance of his duties. I will no't forget it! - One has received 3 months of jail term! - Wait. We will make a donation to the municipality. Wait! 3 months it's not enough. I hope they put you at maximum sentence. You'll become a spinster in prison. You know what is a spinster in prison? You will loose your teeth due to lack of calcium. And your breasts, which you are so proud, will become saggy. You'll write me the letters, and I'll read them as pornographic novel! During this time, I'll get married to Kashmir Princess. What is wrong with me? What a strange feeling. - Bitch! - Murderer! Doctor! She's killing me, doctor! She wants to kill me! Doctor, nurse... Help! Mike! Mike! What is he doing? During the recovery period, stillness should be avoided. I have an idea. - Stop fooling around! Enough, you better help me. Come on. - You spy on women? - Love helps to avoid stilness. You will be better at home. Do you want me to ask the doctor? No, this idiot wants to keep me here for another week. Speaking of idiots, do you have news from Mike? He writes you every day. She thinks you're at home. - Do you miss him? - Do not make me laugh. Hi, Doris. Have you seen Jane? That terrible American, is in love with me. We don't see him. Doris, and who is with you... Is this your grandmother? Bastard! If I was healthy, I would have jump over the fence and raped her. - Like in Carpentras. - What happened in Carpentras? This is our secret. I met Jane there. She lived in the "Golden Lion". I climbed the wall, climbed through the window... - And raped her? - Three times! True, but two times I went through the wrong window. - You laugh, but now I'm disabled. - So what? Small, partial disability of 50 percent... ...with a few dependents. - Not including you? Understand... society consists of two types of people: ... those who pay dues, and those who use them. Hi, Mike! All OK, Mike? Hi, Camille. So, the golden times? Look, what I had to refused... Man-cannon, man-panther... - Any movies? Insanity.

It's time to use the bathroom. Good day! - Hello, my savior angel! - Hello. - Can I make a phone call? - Sure. - Who is this guy? - Michel Gaucher, a stuntman. - Would you like some stew? - No, thanks. - Really? - I know it's tasty, but thank you. - Sorry.

We would be very happy if Monsieur Michel Gaucher has time now... ...to offer him a three-week contract in New Mexico. - For 20 thousand dollars. - How much? 20 thousand dollars. Or 50,000 German marks, or if Monsieur Gaucher prefers... Swiss francs. Oh... Mr. Paramount says hello. We're counting on you. Thank you very much. Old bastard! He wants me to believe in contract for 20 thousand dollars.. ...because of a debt of 250 francs. I guess they're penniless. - You breathe so hard. - It's nothing. I'm all right. A producer just called you. He asked whether you're interested in 20 thousand dollars? I hope you refused because he will take himself 50. - Let him learn some courtesy, you don't call during the lunch! - Hello. - Hello. - Hi. - I have business offer for you. We have so much to do. Well, go away. They need new promo act for supermarket. Simple... Gorilla swings on a rope... If Mike is still in shape. He is better than before. 100%. - Only now I don't do just anything. - Really? No offense, Santos, but you're in food business. With my movie ratings I can't afford this kind of publicity. I'm so sorry. Well. - Bye, guys. - See you. Why did you refuse the work? With the contract for 50 thousand dollars I'm not going to jump like gorilla from shelf to shelf. Mike, who are you, a kid? Wake up! Yes, you're right. Hey Santos! "Panzani"! And today we're advertising pasta "Panzani"! Our gorilla loves it! And you'll, too! Also, only today you can buy two kg for for the price of one! The sale is on right now! You are superb, honestly.

Not quite fit. - You go to the movies? - Yes, if I'm invited. - Did you see "Burning Savannah"? - Yes! It was me who jumped from baobab. - Jump from 15 meters. - I don't believe you. - Do you want to see it? - Yes! - I'll do it for you. - Awsome. Hey, monkey, is not the time! Don't pay any attention to me, baby. Now, look. Like in "Burning Savannah". Look carefully! Shit, my counter. - I get it, I go to the cashier for money. - No way, we will assess damages first.

How are you feeling? - Good, untill you didn't ring the bell. - You are sweet. - I didn't come to you but to see your friend. - Get out! Why did you turned on the light? Darkness for you is harmful. You start recalling, getting depressed. - This is not a depression but melancholy. - It's the same thing. There is a difference like between "drunk as a lord" and "pissed as a fart"! Wait, maybe those're the idiots from Social Services? Maybe they have a bonus for broken heart? - Do not play the fool. - OK, go. - Hey Santos! - Hi Hyacinthe. - Hi, Mike. - Hey, Santos. You shed your skin? Could I ask you a favor. I have a tour in the province with the Duval brothers. On the real trapeze.

You are so funny, when trying to trick me! - Thanks. - I'm so happy! - Good afternoon. - Take your place. Mike, I must confess, I didn't believe you. If I promised, I keep my word! - Promised? What did you promise? - Nothing. I can not believe. How do you lure them? Charm, old boy! And special facial expressions. - Which one? - This one. Witty! - You are Jane Gardner? - Yes. Amazing!... - What's he saying? - He says, nothing to look at. He did not understand. Even a fool can see, what a great figure! - Is he doing an inventory of the property? - No, kidding. - Why do you look at your watch? - Because they are coming! Well, if Monsieur Gaucher ready, me too. Take your places! Mike, be careful today. Next to you is a very beautiful woman. Mike, do not forget, button number 1. - Are you ready, Jane? - Ready.

How are you, dear? Come on, Bruno, I'll explain the scene. It's wonderful, Bruno. Do you see the steps? You hide behind the ledge. Mike is on top. Chinese shot him and he slips here. Monsieur Mike will do this? But it will be very painful! Bruno, but he's your double. What, do we need another backup for your backup? - Of course not. - That's right. Then you get up and say your lines. All in one plan. The audience will not notice anything! Samurai, put on your masks! Good. Are you ready, Mike? Everyone take your places! Action - for everyone. Action! Action! James, they killed him! No! After all, I haven't smoked my last cigarette. And cut! Bravo, Bruno! Great! Was I OK?? Mike, no.
