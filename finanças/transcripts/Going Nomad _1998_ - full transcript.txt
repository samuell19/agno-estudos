[upbeat music] - [Cid] My name is El Cid Rivera. And things are getting a little tight around here. [jazzy music] Like my friends, I was born in this town and have lived here all my life. We work. We eat. We sleep. And after that, we do it all some more. But just to make sure nothing exciting slips through the cracks, me and the boys, we compare notes, regularly. [group chatter] - That was a game, that was a game. - Another fucking Independence Day on our hands, huh. Feeling independent? - It's too hot out to be independent. - Not if you just stay in one place and don't move. - Where else you gonna go when you got it all right here? - It's a no man's land outside this town. - That's the key, Tully, stay here. Just go nowhere. - Cid, that's really not quite the spirit. [laughter] - Am I missing something, Chuckles? Cause nothing I heard should be bringing the house down. - [Chuckles] It just so happens that I have-- - [Cid] A healthy friendship needs a caring sense of give and take. You can say what's on your mind, and no one goes home angry. Chuckles probably knows that best. These days, he's the local apartment broker, renting space to one and all. - Look, don't say fire trap. The word you're looking for to describe this place is palace. Repeat that. Palace. - [Cid] Tully there, he's working on some business degree by day while moonlighting to pay his way. - Alright, let me get this straight. You're gonna give me an extra 50 bucks if I finish this guy off with a swinging neck breaker? Count me in. - [Cid] Our local reverend over there, Rev, takes tolls at the Midtown Tunnel. He dropped out of the priesthood due to personal habits he could not kick. - I love chicks. And the times I've truly felt the presence of God was when I was rolling around with a babe. I need a drink. - [Cid] And then there's Eddie. [laughter] Sometimes I look at these guys and I see the old men they're gonna be, sitting at the same table, swigging the same beer until they're carted away. - Look, look, today, you let everybody else clear out of this town, leaving the place to yourself. - Nothing going on outside this town anyway. New York is tops. - Yeah. - I'll drink to that. - But hey, these are my pals, the boys hanging together through thick and thin since grammar school, day in, day out, week after week, year after year. Currently in our fourth decade together. The way it ought to be. [birds chirping] The worst thing about a July Fourth is that there is a July fifth clamoring right in after it. No room to breathe. Time to get your bearings, especially when you're trying to plant your flag in this world. I've always wanted to get up in the morning with a sense of purpose. And these days, I think I'm on to something. Life as a bounty hunter is very compelling. Mr. Flynn, this is Manhattan Electric and Gas. You're bill of 129 dollars is now three months due. Cough up the dough you little twerp. Thanks so much. Yeah that's right, 239 dollars and 91 cents or we shut down your business. Yes, you owe 43 dollars. Now I can send someone around to kneecap you on Friday if you're available. Please, ma'am, I'm very busy. No, it's a big job lighting the world. Yes, Mrs. Bernstein, my name is El Cid Rivera. Well yes of course. Yeah, you were my ninth grade science teacher. Wow, I thought you were dead. No, I guess I never did turn in that lab report. Momentum equals mass times velocity. So you're saying you're not paying until I hand it in. I see your point ma'am. It wasn't long before my sense of dedication dwarfed the mission at hand. [upbeat music] I've become what you might call a journeyman, applying my trade wherever it's needed and moving on when the job is done. But what would it be like to be so good at one thing that there's no question about what to do with your life? Like playing the saxophone or figure skating. I could deal with the Ice Capades. [speaking foreign language] Hey fellas. How you doing? [speaking foreign language] - Hey Cid. [speaking foreign language] Oh, that's right. I forgot. You don't speak Spanish. [speaking foreign language] I'll get it. What can I get you? - Actually, Jose, I just, just want a cup of coffee. - Cup of coffee, coming right up. [speaking foreign language] You want milk with that? - Yeah, please. [speaking foreign language] - [Cid] Some people draw a lot of strength from their ethnic heritage. It's that important sense of belonging. My mother raised me after we lost my father. She spoke Spanish beautifully, but with me, she'd only speak English. She was going to raise a little American. She said she wanted me to succeed and didn't want me speaking with an accent. [speaking foreign language] When maybe the thing I need most is a little accent. - Come on, yeah, that's it. You got it. El Gringo's coming out. That's it. Alright man, it looks good, looks good brother, it looks really, really good. [speaking foreign language] - Hey, how about that cup of coffee, you know? [speaking foreign language] - Take it. - Yeah. Thanks a lot fellas. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. [speaking foreign language] Dinero, remember. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Here you go, Jose. Just keep the change. Split it amongst yourselves, alright. [speaking foreign language] So long fellas. [speaking foreign language] - [Man] I can't believe this man. [group chatter] - [Man] He's the best. - Hey, what's up? - Hey, Cid. - How you doing? - Look, I don't care if the guy holds a dick continental title belt, he shouldn't go busting your glasses. - Look, I laid in a couple of shots, but then blackjack, he whips me into the ring ropes and bam, launches me skyward. - It was beautiful. - Where'd you land? - [Tully] Third row. Some fat guy and his fat family. - Get to the punishing finish, Tully. - Alright, so anyway, Blackjack, he's got to improvise some final move, right. - And creative genius he is-- - Smacks me over the head with a metal chair. - Hence the alterations in the glasses. - What a closer. - Hey, Blackjack is a very gifted individual. [door slams] - When you wrestling again? - Um, Friday night. My pal Jumbo requesting me for his title warmup match. - Hello Chuckles, Eddie. - Hello, Geraldine. - Tully, Theodore. - Rev, Officer Fusco, Rev will do. - I'll make a note of that, Theodore. - Why she gotta go and do that? - Hey, Cid, you ever notice that Fusco never mentions your name when she says hello? - Oh she knows him alright. - Who could forget? - What's that supposed to mean? - It just means that ever since you punched Geraldine Fusco in the mouth in fourth grade, she's not forgotten. - It's like she's got a score to settle or something. - If I were you, I'd watch your ass at all times. No, no, she patrols this neighborhood. She's everywhere and nowhere when you least expect it. - Yeah, and she packs that nine millimeter cannon with a badge to back it up. - You still think she remembers the fourth grade? - It's fresh. Still very fresh. - It wasn't that bad. - It all started with one very specific dodge ball incident. - Yeah, could we change the subject please? - [Rev] Yeah, yeah, let it be. - No, she had to rub it in. - No, no, drop it man. - No, no, go on laughing boy. Let's hear it. - Well, Fusco struts up to Cid and get this, she says how you gonna play when no one wants you on their fucking team? [laughter] - Yeah, well she was the first one to use the word "fucking" in a complete sentence. - No one wants you on their fucking team. - Yeah, I'd a punched her lights out. - I saw red and I swung. I swung on her. And the next thing I know, I'm fist deep in molars. - Cid, I was wrong. There's no way she's gotten over that. - Hey, which tooth was it? - Lower lateral incisor. - Oh geeze. Not that one. - Cid, you got Geraldine Fusco on your ass, in perpetuity. PS 109's greatest dodge ball player ever. - Track and field star. - Olympic hopeful. - Now she's bigger, faster, stronger, shaped by an elite law enforcement agency, fueled by a blood thirsty need for revenge. - [Chuckles] You are dead, Cid. - [Eddie] Dead meat, pal. - It was the fourth grade. - Sure, that's the way to play it when you're being stalked by a killing machine. - You are dead, Cid. - Yeah, I think we covered that Chuckles. - [Tully] Poor bastard. - Yeah. I'd be lying if I said I enjoy being stalked. Why the hell didn't my parents teach me to stand up to this shit? My father kicked the bucket, and my mother dies too early, and all I get is the name, El Cid. El Cid Rivera. But how can I blame my mother for it, especially when it's Charlton Heston's fault. - [Mama] My Cid, Charlton is a beautiful man. A man who's been Michelangelo, John the Baptist, Ben Hur, and Moses. - [Cid] Yeah, well, Charlton finally had to go and give her an epic hero with a Spanish name. 1961, the big screen, El Cid, the champion of Spain. El Cid, [speaking foreign language]. Charlton wouldn't put up with a Geraldine Fusco. He'd go biblical and kick ass in sandals. Why this name, mama? Charlton's a god damned epic hero. He united Spain for Christ's sake. How the fuck am I supposed to compete with that? - [Mama] Watch your tongue, my son. Make mama proud and concentrate on succeeding. - [Cid] I can't, mama. It's too late to be succeeding. There's no one to triumph over at this hour. - [Mama] Then get up bright and early and begin succeeding my Cid. - [Cid] I'll try mama. [soft music] - So what's up with Cid these days? - Probably drank some bad hops or something. He'll work it out on the road. [soft music] - You ask me, he's better off going to bed. - Nah, miles to go before he sleeps. - [Cid] My name is El Cid Rivera, and nighttime's my favorite time of day. At this hour, the streets are your own, waiting for you to take them and make them into something. [soft music] - New York at night, it's the best time of all. It's when a blanket of sleep falls over this city. I mean New York rejoins the planet at night, reclaimed by nature, this city's rush hour pulse turns to normal. Now by day, this city's all revved up. It's a marching band on the wack, blaring and wailing, a crush of sound and motion. But by night, the bands gone home, confused and tuckered out. There's an opening up in the streets again. And you know while most people sleep, tucked away between comfy sheets, we the nomads take command of the streets. Our tribe of nocturnal drifters ride in this wide open city. - What do they call us? Not many people know we exist. - Asphalt nomads. That's what I call us. - Asphalt nomads. Blacktop rovers. - Peggy Fleming. I call us Peggy Fleming. - You can't just send in box tops to join, you gotta keep something this personal quite, otherwise everybody wants in and before you know it, it's armature hour. - Peggy Fleming. - There's no secret hand shake or grand poo bah, you just put in here every once in a while, catch up with friends, be yourself. We call it the Oasis. - You're standing in it. It's like a pit stop. The Oasis. - It's the one fixed point. It's the one port of call for a nomad. It's where paths, stories crisscross in a night of a thousand journeys. - You have over 5,000 miles of road in the five boroughs of New York City. That is a lot of country to cover. - 900 miles of road in Manhattan alone. 900 miles. Why the hell you gonna go driving cross country? You never have to leave this island. - Peggy Fleming. - This ain't your Hell's Angels or lady's garden club. Just by looking at the way someone handles themselves on the road, you know who belongs. [soft music] - Hey, hey, Chuckles. - Oh, hey, thanks for meeting me. - Yeah. - How do I explain this? You know how I spent all my time downtown? - Yeah. - I always say that downtown's where it's at. It's a total wasteland uptown. - Yeah. - Well there's this movie playing on 19th Street. - Sounds good. - No, it's not good. It's not good at all. You see, to get there I have to, - What? - I've never crossed 14th Street in my life. - [Cid] Wow. Your own personal Berlin Wall. - Let's face it Cid, the world ends above 14th Street, until now. - Until this movie. Come on, it'll be easy. - We're talking about 14th Street here man. Big dividing line on this island. I cross this border, and I'm breaking all my own rules. - Hey, you got your ideals to uphold. - I got a movie to see. - I'll make the crossing with you. - Okay, you gotta shield me along the way so that no one spots me. - Stand beside me man. We are going to make the crossing. [slow suspenseful music] - Hey didn't you hear me, you gotta shadow me. - This is it. We got a meeting on the other side. - Hey, slow down. - Spare me your lip man. - Easy. Easy. [horns honking] Easy. - Use your fear. use your fear. - Easy. - Surging. Hug the wall, hug the wall. - What are you doing? - Stay with me. Stay with me, move, move, move. The glorious must not rest upon the laurels of their achievements. - Let go of my arm you jerk. - Oh hey, come on. - I'm sure I've been spotted. - Oh no, no, it's only a small crowd. Come on, this is gonna bring us closer together, you watch. - Jerk. [slow rock music] - [Tully] Big day at work pal? - The biggest. - [Tully] You still at the stake pit? - Jack's Steak Pit. - How long have you been there? - Three days tops. - No, I'm deep into my fifth. It's called commitment. You should try it sometime. - Ooh. - You work the grill. - No, see that's how it would look to you, Edward. But it's not your fault. When I signed on at Jack's, I saw beyond the grill. - You're standing at the grill. - No, I've completely redefined the position, Tully. - To what? - Keeper of the flame. No, I've chosen to work with the earth's most basic elements, wind, water, meat and fire. Fire providing light and warmth to earliest man. Fire, which consumed Joan of Ark and gutted Little Pete Topless in 1985. - Little Pete, the poor bastard. - Now it's my turn to keep the flames in check because somewhere between the slabs of T-bone and the chopped chuck hides that dancing flicker that aims to take the whole place down. - Cid, Cid, crank the fucking flame down. You're turning good meat into hockey pucks man. - Hey, I am harnessing flames for the good of people, but you turn your back on 'em Jack. - I ain't Jack! The name's Stanley. - What happened to Jack? - Look, keep the dance low and cut the Smokey the Bear shit. - Alright. The man is obviously not in tune with my mission. - Nor could you expect him to be. - Get back. The meat has got to breathe. Back, damn you. I am the master. - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, cut that shit out. - I had to show the flames who was boss, establish respect from the get go. But I promise you next time-- - No, no, no, no. There won't be a next time. I'm busting your ass down to salad bar. - Oh man. - Stay off the ladder. Stay away from the fire extinguisher. - Yeah, what if the flames get out of control? - No, no, no, no, no, no, if a fire breaks out, you grab the lettuce and haul ass out with me. You got that loco? - Yeah. It's a setback. It's nothing I can't handle. - Sounds like they took you out of the play all together. - Not before I saw the light. They can't take that from me. Staring deep into the flames, I connected with the fire that roars deep inside myself and I received my marching orders. - To do what? - I'm joining the fire department. - The fire department? - A union job is good. - Yeah. - You know how long it takes to get into the fire department? - Yeah, I stand ready, Chuckles. Yesterday I actually applied for the exams. - Pray for a fat envelope. - [Cid] A what? - A fat envelope. My cousin did it. At the end, they send you an envelope, thin one says sorry sap, you're rejected. Fat one means they're sending you the join the club booklets. - Don't worry about envelopes. - Hey, it's not like we're not supportive or anything, it's just-- - Nah, it's just the day is let's be Surgeon General day, tomorrow's French Foreign Legion day, and Friday, Friday is Fireman day. - Why wait until Friday. To El Cid, the keeper of the flame. - Yeah. - I don't know about you, I'm just stretching my arm. [slow music] - What does a nomad drive? Something that hugs a lane and a half, guaranteeing a lions share respect. - A car with heft. Anything that weighs several tons. - The cabbies bounce right off it. Drives them crazy. But what the cabbies gonna do? You gonna need the coast guard to haul me in. - There what the uncultured laymen might call a boat. Say from the early to mid 70s, the LTD, the Marquis. - You got your basic Lincoln Mark four, or any of the early 70s continentals for that matter. - Buick Lesaber, the Electra 225, the big cars. The kind that say I may not know where I'm going, but you better believe I'm on my way. - The Regency. The Cutlass. The Olds 88. - These glorious tubs are chariots, I tell ya. A symbol of the last time America was truly free. - It's a kind of car that a 30 miles an hour, you can take out a telephone pole without spilling your coffee. - I tell you what, why don't we split the difference. We'll call 12:15. - That's a good point. Hey, we should give Cid a call. - Let it be. [inaudible] out there driving around in circles. [laughter] - Lay off, that's his thing. [laughter] [soft music] - What do you want to know about El Cid? - Rivera? He's one of the greats. - Cid River's got a few head problems. But it doesn't seem to effect his driving. - I love Cid, but I hear he doesn't speak Spanish. What's up with that? How are you gonna express your passion to me? - That Cid guy, he ain't so hot. He's a punk. [speaking foreign language] It's his car that makes that guy anything. I should know, I sold it to him. - I have no idea what he does during the day, but it's got to be something big, all that talent. [upbeat music] [traffic rumbling] [group chatter] - [Cid] Gotta stay in the open. - For to be a-- - [Cid] She can't take me out if there are witnesses. Play it cool. Stay very cool. Alright, fuck cool. Run like hell. - Well Rev, that's cause we haven't done enough grooming together lately. Tonight, I was in the thick of a dynamite lather, making love to the much overlooked scalp. [laughter] Creamer, conditioner, and bring it on home with a towel dry. - Wow. - Cleanliness is next to godliness. [soft music] Is that right, Tully? You like rolling around with fat guys in spangled tights? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm part of a very proud sporting tradition. Playing high school gyms and run down armories with cigar chomping, beer guzzling, thugs at ringside. - Tell 'em Tully. - Am I rolling at all? Wrestlers come to me to improve their records. You see I'm the booster. I send contenders to the top. Nothing like it. The beauty of 300 pound bodies soaring high in the air, colliding, without a scratch. Huge bodies never meant to fly spinning like ballerinas. - [Mama] Cid, El Cid. - [Cid] Yes mama. - [Mama] El Cid, are you succeeding? - Dammit mama, you made me miss a light. I'm on the trail of a perfect ride and you go block my flow. - [Mama] You can flow tomorrow, my precious one. How are you going to make mama proud with your ass planted in that car? - I'm just relaxing out here. - [Mama] When are you going to become mama's little lawyer? - Mama, the world isn't the way you remember it. Everyone hates lawyers today. - [Mama] But you are my Cid. People will love when you because a Supreme Court Justice. - Yeah, I'll get right on that tomorrow. - I like your idea about being a booster, Tully. I'm kind of a booster myself. - Oh, geeze. - Hey, I actively support this community by settling good people in our humble town. - Now look, I'm not renting this fire trap. It's a goddamn hole. - Everybody's got a place in this town cause of me. I keep things flowing. - Flow. You're gonna talk about flow. - [Chuckles] That's just what transpired, Rev. - Well it's just that I'm the holy man of flow. - Yeah, flowed right out of the priesthood. [laughter] - And into a tollbooth where I belong. I was called to take tolls at the Queens' Midtown Tunnel. - One of God's more mysterious plans, huh. - Almost biblical, Eddie, cause now I'm the gate keeper. I mean let the priest help the faithful in the gates of Heaven. If you want in in this town, you come to me and you pay the price. If I don't deem you worthy, I pull the alarm, like you're trying to beat the toll and the cops swarm all over your ass, tying you up in bullshit. Meanwhile, I take a powder and a very well timed coffee break. - Wow. [soft music] - [Cid] Block after block after neighborhood after mile in search of the perfect ride, keeping my sweeps wide, keeping my turns tight, hoping to come around fast enough so that I might catch a glimpse of myself. - Do you know what it's like to float to Third Avenue at seven miles an hour? To own Fifth Avenue? To take Sixth Avenue and all its six lane glory, massaging blacktop that's usually choked by traffic. - Graceful moves, floating arcs, rolling through this town like a magic carpet. - Going nowhere fast. - Just going. - Just getting out and going. The sheer power of going. - Never getting lost. Hey, you're bounded by rivers. You can only go so far before you hit water. - Midnight to 5:30. - I have to let him in, but before Good Morning America. - Late at night when midnight strikes. It's when the nomads take back the city, blazing trails and making waves and leaving behind a chain city in our wake. [slow music] - You know-- [suspenseful music] Whoa. [suspenseful music] Okay, okay, say you got me. You got me. Sure, more than 22 years have passed since I assaulted you on the playground, but you know, a tooth's a tooth. So go ahead. Apply excessive force or whatever's evoked down at the station house. Wield your sword of justice. Take it to me, woman. Mend my ways. Hello up there. - Yeah. - Yeah, could we get the beating underway, please? - Well I'm not sure what to do. - Well, they must have covered this down at the academy. I mean-- - It's just that I've been waiting for this moment for so long, I, I never imagined-- - Imagined what? - I never thought about what I'd actually do when I got to it. - Okay. How about we, we skip the bruising and we move straight into some low intensity shoving? - Would you like to go to dinner sometime? - Ah, I'm gonna repeat what I just heard, because-- - I'm asking you if you'd like to go to dinner. - Sure, why not. - Oh that's great. That's really great. - You're not pissed about the tooth? - Not as much anymore. - Oh good, that's a weight off my shoulders. - Wow. This really does feel good. - Yeah, everything out in the open. - And speaking your feelings. - So when you want to get together? - How about Friday night? You know that I've liked you for such a long time, I just didn't know how to show you. - Here we are. - You always had that cute wayward look about you. - I bet you say that to all your callers. - So, Friday night. [jazzy music] - [Cid] My name is El Cid Rivera. Today will be different. Today I am dressed for success. Clad in the footwear of champions, I will walk the walk of Charlton, endorsed by Moses, torture tested by Ben Hur, these babies send a message. I will show all that I am serious. Big things happen in these shoes. [traffic rumbling] [group chatter] - Okay, one more. - One more, on the floor. On the floor. - Oh, that's mine. That's my scene. If I can keep working my moves, then I'm happy. - You just keep doing what your doing. - That's right. - And that's enough. - Oh, come on, Cid. Nothing's ever enough for you, is it? - No, it's not. - [Eddie] What the hell is it you want? - I want to feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself. - [Tully] So join something. - Join where, Tully? All the big causes have already happened. - Hey, keep hanging out with us and you'll make history, eh. - How are we making history here? - I think you're struggling too hard. - Cid, there's no room today for the epic hero. Epic gets in the way. Now you go to pull some miracle on 14th Street, you'll tie up traffic, fuck up the whole city. [laughter] - Clearly you guys don't understand. - Hey, the greats are always misunderstood. - Yeah. - Hey, see you tomorrow night. - Same time, same place, same pals. - Give me the quarter. - Right, reverential one, here you go. - Let me see that one. [slow jazzy music] - [Cid] When all else fails, count on gravity. Once you're on the floor, you can't fall any further. Things get to be too much up there, take the hit, hit the deck. And when the dust clears, you try getting to your knees. You make your stand again. On the floor, it's only up from here. - Hey Cid, I came as fast as I could. - Really, thanks for meeting me. - Hey, you were there for me on 14th Street, you know. Not that you helped much, but you were there. - Chuckles, I've come to a very important decision, but I have to know that I can trust you. - Who else you gonna trust? - I've decided that I must lead. - You don't have to go anywhere pal. - No, lead. I must lead. But before I do, I must ask a special favor. - Yes, my Cid. - If I should die, these are my writings. - Hey, I didn't know you wrote. You talked about writing, but I never figured you'd do anything about it. - No, no I write, you know, when I have something to say, I write. - Okay. - If I should die, take the word to my people. - Who are your people? - I don't know. - Huh. - And they don't know either. My people are called those who don't know, and they know who they are. - What's this again? - My writings, my tome, the word. [laughter] - The word? - Laugh not chuckling one. If I should not return safely to my home tonight, you must take the word and bring it to my people and let them carry on. Bankers who don't want to bank, but do. Software engineers who want to design cities, but don't. Old timers tortured by opportunities not seized. Waiters wanting out. Temps seeking permanence. These are people wanting change but they know not where or how to do it. These are my people. - All this is in here? - It will be, as soon as I know what to say. Don't rush me, Chuckles. - I better get going. My beeper just went off, and I-- - You don't carry a beeper. - No, I do now. - Oh well then, off you go. - Yes, my Cid. [soft music] - [Cid] Geraldine Fusco, what a babe. At first glance, a volatile girl with the stopping power of a small battalion. But now, now she's just so much more than a terminator to me. My sweet Geraldine, she wakes up in the morning and knows exactly which way she's heading. Sturdy steel shanked boots, thighs of an olympian sheathed in a striking poly cotton blend. And check out the chest, the arms all at once capable of a loving embrace, or a crippling submission hold. And oh, that angel's face. All with a smile that bathes you in light and reassures you it's not you she'll be tossing into the back of the squad car. And every man's dream, a woman with a bat utility belt. Imagine the adventures. This relationship could have real possibilities. - [Eddie] Dipping and dodging. - Dipping and dodging, right Chuckles? [laughter] - Yeah, right. Dipping and dodging. I know what dipping and dodging is. - [Rev] You know what it is? - [Chuckles] I've always known. - Boys. I've been thinking. - And what's that? - Well I'd kind of like to switch chairs. - Now why would you want to do a thing like that? - Well, it'd shake up the perspective a little. Well Chuckles here, he's got the perfect view of the windows. And Rev, he gets the chicks at the door. And me, I'm tired of looking at our ravaging barkeep, Leo. - Now you're mine. - Look, Tully, that's all fine and good, but a, this is the way it's been for years. - I vote no. - Look, Tully, people are accustomed to seeing me in this chair. Now if we suddenly change seats, they may see you, which could upset them. I don't want those people upset. - So stay where you are, Edward. Maybe me and Chuckles can switch. Hey Chuckles, you'd like it over here. - Fat chance. Look Tully, you just don't go swapping-- - [Cid] It's funny, isn't it? Romance blossoms in ways you never see coming. Me and Geraldine, our courtship was fast and furious. We could while away the hours, reliving the magic of our first romantic encounters. Day by day, our feelings grew. She loved it when I resisted arrest. She loved it even more when I watched her in action. - Book 'em honey. - I said spread 'em, fuckwad. So, are we still on for Wednesday night? - You got it baby. My Geraldine was alive. By day, she walked a world of heightened drama. By night, officer Fusco took my world by storm. We could talk about anything from sex to capital punishment, to troop strength in Latin America. I had dreams. She had dreams. I'd like to lead a nation or join the fire department, be a figure skater. - Ever since I was a little girl, I've always dreamed of becoming a Texas Ranger. Oh, you got to be one tough bitch for that. - That's so nice. The fact was, we connected. She knew where the lines were drawn and I, I have always been a big fan of lines. - So you want me to start it up killer? Is that what you want? - Yeah, baby, that'd be great. And my Geraldine, only my tender Geraldine, could turn the Miranda into a passionate act of love. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, see, and feel can and will be held against you. [soft music] - [Cid] That was order in the world again. I was dating the rule book. And it's name was Geraldine Fusco. - You just don't go swapping seats. - What we got here is kind of like Meet the Press. You don't see them swapping seats. - Isn't that right Cid? - Oh you got it baby. [soft music] - Ray's the night. And at night, Ray holds sway. By day, my time is their time, boss bitching at me, family riding my ass, pressures that would kill the ordinary mortal. But at night, it's Ray's road. And I will this car like a sword, slicing through the night with a steady hand. Oh come closer taxi cab, I beckon thee. Cross my path so I may broadside thee. Feel my girth. Taste my essence. Back the fuck off cause it's Ray's road tonight. And I'll release it as fast as I can pump the accelerator and make higher ground. It's all so Ray. - [Mama] Cid, El Cid. - [Cid] Yes mama. - [Mama] Are you ready to talk now? - [Cid] Yes mama. - [Mama] El Cid, are you succeeding? - [Cid] I'm trying mama. - [Mama] Is this why I slaved day and night so that you could become some night riding [speaking foreign language]? [speaking foreign language] Clown. Night riding clown. Repeat that back for mama. - Mama. - [Mama] Yes, my beautiful one. - I can't do this now. I'm gonna crash the car. - [Mama] Well, you go park it and I'll come back. - Whatever, mama. While all was not perfect on the career front, I was learning to strike a balance. Life with Geraldine was getting better and better. She helped me get in touch with my feelings, and she was right there to help me sort them out. - Who is in charge? - Come on, lay off. - Answer the question. Who's in control? - Would you get the hell off. I run the show, dammit. - Wrong answer, fuckwad. Now, I want to hear your true feelings for me. - Get the fuck off me, Fusco. - Who do you love? - You're breaking my arm, Fusco. - I'll snap it right off, Rivera. Now who's in love? - You gotta be fucking kidding. - Do you see me smiling, boy? Huh? So say it. Love, right. Love. - Alright, alright, I have feelings and I call it like. - You what? - I'm in like with you, you know. We got a really strong like on our hands, pookey. - It's a tough world out there, and you and I are not gonna make it on like. So say it. Love. - I've never felt like like this before. - Alright. That'll do for now. You're free to go. - It's my fucking place. - Okay, at ease then. Look, sometimes I get caught up in the heat of the moment. My adrenaline starts pumping and boom, my head explodes. It's got to be the academy training. - What we got is special, Geraldine. [soft music] With every moment, I believed even more strongly in us. Here was a woman willing to fight for love. And I, El Cid Rivera, was part of the struggle. - The streaming of light and sound, she goes and goes like a river flows, like the mighty Mississippi. Broadway's a river, as great as any of the American greats. The Hudson, the Ohio, the Colorado, flowing down Manhattan Island, landing at the battery, emptying to the sea. This mighty river of black top transverses this phrenetic strip of rock, a giant brace for a city that might otherwise spin out of control, fed by tributaries, feeding neighborhoods, connecting all. Broadway is the mighty carrier rolling through the plains of Harlem and the canyons of Midtown down through the un-tamable lands of Greenwich Village. Broadway, carrying the city on it's back, dropping off, picking up, breathing in and out at it's banks. If asked, I'd say that I like Broadway best in the thick of night when it's waters are darkest, blacktop beckoning, opening up wide and promising mysteries. I answer the call. I push off. And I pilot my Grand Marquis downstream. I steer but in its grip, I surrender to the current, riding high, letting go. And it's goes and goes. Broadway. Mighty as the Mississippi, mysterious as the Nile and hallowed as the Ganges. Keeper of the nomad faith, lifeblood of the perfect ride. - Clear. Yes, all clear. [traffic rushing] [slow jazzy music] - You keep saying that word fire trap, and it's really beginning to bug me. - [Cid] Your runway, increase throttle. - The work of God is this, to believe in the one he has sent. Enter my gates. - Ready. Oh yes. Prepare for takeoff. - Oh yeah. Love it. Love the do. [upbeat music] We're breaking out, we're lifting off. [wind blowing] [metal crashing] [knock on door] It's open, come on in. - I'm not bothering you, am I? - No, no, no, definitely not. [laughter] - Cid, I just had to talk to you. I can't believe it. I can't believe all this is happening to me. - Yeah, well I'm happy too. You shout it to the world. We're an item pookey. - That too. But what I'm talking about is this letter. It just came in the mail today. - Well the postal service is wonderful, honey. It's something we should all be proud of. - Cid. I've been accepted. - Accepted to what? - I am going to be a Texas Ranger. - A Texas Ranger? How you gonna pull that off from here? - You knucklehead, I'm gonna be a Texas Ranger in Texas. I've had the application in for over two years. - I thought you were just talking about your dream. - Yeah, but why talk about it when I can do it? - Because talking's enough. There's less chance of getting injured. - Oh Cid, when I first started to think about Texas-- - [Cid] This isn't happening. I'm alone again. I'm facing the world alone again. Man does this suck. - But think about it Cid. Me in Texas bagging chain saw murderers. - God, how can she throw away what we have? Alright, steady now. Steady. Just check to see if she's still using that word leaving. - Do you know they don't wait? So I'll be leaving next Tuesday. - Oh God Dammit! There it is. - I know this is sudden and it's really gonna be hard for me to say goodbye to you, but-- - Oh just wrap it up, wrap it up baby, you're ruining my life. Oh, she's got to stop talking sometime, her mouth is just gonna seize up. - So, I've got to. - Oh goddammit, please don't say it. Please don't say it. - I mean, I've got to. - Incoming boy, take cover. - Cid, we've got to break it off. - [Cid] Oh goddammit, there it is. This is not happening. She's, she's emotional. She's deranged. - Wow. You're so composed. Obviously, this isn't effecting you like it's hurting me. - [Cid] Just pray for the building to collapse. A year in traction will bring her around. - Man, I'm beat. I think I'm gonna be heading home. - This isn't happening. - You know, you've helped me. You've shown me that it's okay to go after what I want. - [Cid] Oh lips, man, move you're goddamned lips. Show her you're still alive. - Bye Cid. [somber music] - Hey, um, if I let you chase me down the block, would you stay? - You are gonna make some woman really happy. - Goodbye Fusco. She loved the thrill of the chase. She caught me, made me confess. And once she had me, the thrill was gone. Anyone at the precinct could have told me. Fusco always gets her man. - Come on Cid, what's the point? - I'm jumping. I gotta jump. There's no other way. - Why's he gotta jump? - He hasn't said. - Hey Cid, why you gotta jump? - Geraldine. - I thought the stalking was over? - Yeah, that ended Tully, but so did the love. - I didn't hear about the love. - We gotta get some experts on the scene. - Good idea, you keep talking to him, I'll get some help. - Hey Cid, you've always been there to help me. Why don't you get the fuck down so you can help me some more. - Yeah Chuckles, how have I helped you? - Remember 14th Street? You were there for me when I needed to make the crossing. - Oh come on. It was your big moment, you wanted to keep it low key. I turned it into a circus. - Maybe you should take the leap. - And then there was that time in seventh grade when I set your hair on fire. - Definitely jump, you fuck. - What the hell's going on here? - She left me to become a Texas Ranger. She was my pillar. She was my calm in the storm. - So you're gonna jump? - Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump. I m gonna taste life hanging in the balance. - Charlton Heston would not be up there. - Oh you leave him out of this. - Fuck it. Go ahead and jump. - Ignore this man. - Go higher. A few more floors up, then jump. - Silence. - Yeah, how will you know the difference if you never make a move? - Eddie, this is nowhere to go. - It's the only way. Make the jump, Cid. Make it dramatic and push off like you want it. And pull a jackknife with a double twist. Own it. - Eddie, I gotta tell you about what happened Thursday night. - Alright, now's the time. Tell me now. - Okay. Okay. A man in the tollbooth right on me, and I'm pushing him through. I'm making change when all of a sudden this beautiful blonde pulls up. Bang, I cut her loose. Next up, dynamite redhead. She's winking. She's smiling. She's doing everything but marry me. [birds chirping] - Oh Fusco. You were supposed to save me. Whoa. [soft music] - How you supposed to strike a balance in this goddamned world? You got a job, a family. You work your ass off. Then you have it reattached and you work it off again. You feel trapped, you poor bastard. You once had the backbone and the legs to get the fuck out. But escaping is too easy. I say keep the normal life. Trim your hedges. Recycle your aluminum. Win the bread. You gotta eat, right? But if you feel like blowing town, don't. Blow in town. Blow all around town. Get inside your ship of steel and open the fucker up. Make your jailbreak every day until the sun goes down and go man, go. Cause a life of the Asphalt Nomads says you can roam, you can be free, and still be home in time for breakfast with the kids. - Hey, hey. Ray, what's going on? - Hey, my Cid. Say man, you mind if I ride with you tonight? My car's out of commission. - Yeah, hop in. - So how's the driving been? - Nice and quite. - Yeah, well that's the way it aught to be. - What happened to your car man? - Yeah, well man it's like this. You know, I'm gliding up 8th Avenue the other night, you know, riding oh so high on the hog. And then I swerved off course a little, you know, jumped the curb and bam, buried the fucker deep inside a newsstand. Boom. Took the whole shack down. Now I was setting up for an easy double Hudson, and the next thing I know, oh Red's plowing his way into the headlines. - Jesus Christ. - You know, it's a true pleasure to watch you at the wheel. - I'm just steering, two hands. - No, no, that's bullshit. Hey, you'll find your pocket and float your boat. It's automatic. - I do that? - [Ray] Yes you do. - Yeah, well you should see some of the other nomads. - No, fuck that and take the compliment man. What you got is gold. Gold. [laughter] Oh man, this boat rides so damn smooth. [soft music] Damn, what a move. Hey, you put it on slow release and then bam, we're in the thick of a triple axle. - Yeah, that's one of my favorites. [laughter] - Expect nothing less from El Cid. You know only a few have even tried a flying Melinda. Anybody ever watch you do it? - Yeah, I don't think anybody cares. - No, no, save the modesty bullshit. Now I need to know. I mean now that I'm riding in your inner sanctum. Give me the scoop on that Rivera magic. - Come on. - No, no, come on now you can't hold out on me. This is Ray, okay. Ray. - What, you really want to know? - [Ray] I want to know. - You're not ready. - Yes I am, I'm ready. - Ballet slippers. - What you say? - Ballet slippers on my feet to work the pedals. - That's bullshit. - No, no, look in the glove compartment. - No fucking way. [laughter] Well shit. I'm riding with Ball shore Rivera. - Light on the touch, light on the pedals. Now I'm floating into a smooth stretch, I slip them on, tickle the pedals. I can turn this boat around like a trained dolphin. - Man you are one different motherfucker. [laughter] Hey y'all, this is El Cid Rivera behind the wheel. Yeah, El Cid [speaking foreign language] Take notice motherfuckers. [laughter] [soft music] You know Cid, you got all of this going on and you still running around this town trying to find your thing. - I'm just sweeping the grid here. - Yeah, but you take a corner like you hoping to arrive somewhere. - No, there's no harm in looking for a sign. - The sign is here dammit. When you feel the pull of a five lane sweep. When you hurdle through space, cradling the natural forces, you're in the thick of it baby. Well take your throne behind the wheel, El Cid. Inherit what's yours man. Own it. Look, drop me off at the next corner. Big Red's gotta get his beauty rest before work starts. - [Cid] It was good seeing you Ray. - You go ahead and take it lightly, Cid. But you get back out on that road and you feel it for even an instant, then you tell me I'm lying. [slow jazzy music] - [Cid] My name is El Cid Rivera. Today I am 33 years old. Since I landed on this earth, the world has made 12,045 rotations and completed 33 total revolutions, and I'm still standing still. - [Tully] I think I wrestled him. [laughter] - No. I don't think you wrestled flesh eating disease or you wouldn't be here right now. - That's a real name of some wrestler guy? - Flesh Eating Disease. - Is he big? - Yeah, he's big, he's huge. - He's not as big as he was, though. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Hey Eddie. - Hey, happy birthday, El Cid Rivera. Did you think we'd forget? - Oh no, all the hoopla gave it away. - [Tully] Well let's get the festivities underway, Edward. Take your seat. - I would, but then I wouldn't be able to bring in a very special surprise guest. - How about some good news? - [Eddie] You could say that. - Some good news from the fire academy, maybe hand delivered? - It's gotta be the fat envelope. Fat envelope says you're gonna be a fireman, baby. - Better than that. Come on, pal. Who'd you like to meet most? - Holy shit. You've really come through. - Oh don't tell me you got-- - You brought Heston to the bar? - Oh god, dear god. - Well, no. But almost as good. El Cid Rivera, celebrating 33 years since your official launch from the womb, meet the one, the only, Ralphie Dodd. - This is it? - This is it. - So who's the birthday boy? Happy birthday. Hey, somebody bring me a bourbon. - Funny, you don't look like Charlton Heston. - It's Ralphie Dodd. - What's a Ralphie Dobs? - I tried to get Heston, but his personal secretary suggested that Cid get a life of his own. - Is somebody getting me a bourbon? - I never dreamed I'd be meeting Ralphie Dodd. - Who the hell is Ralphie Dodd? - Come on, Cid. Ever heard of a little film called Ben Hur? - Faint recollection. - [Eddie] Remember the great chariot race? - Only one of the greatest moments in silver screen history. - Ralphie Dodd, you directed Ben Hur? - No. Ralphie here is the guy who actually painted the wheels on Ben Hur's chariot. - In the flesh. [laughter] - Well, well, pull up a chair, Ralphie. - No, no, no, Tully, do not mock this man, for he is the genuine article. He has walked amongst the sacred. He has tasted from the cup. - Where the fuck is my bourbon? - [Barkeep] Here's your bourbon. - [Eddie] Alright, let's kick off this joyous celebration. - I don't know where to begin. - Hey, hey, look champ. I mean no offense, but you strike me as kind of a fruitcake. Hey Eddie, I don't know how safe it is sitting next to this guy. - No, Ralphie, stay. Make it special. - Well now they say that you served alongside the man called Heston. Now you heard his words, you saw him in action. - Hey, hey, back off will you. You're beginning to make me a little nervous. - Ralphie, he's harmless. He's just so excited. - Yeah, that's what they said about Jack Ruby. - Alright, well let me, let me rephrase the question. - Hey, ceasefire, will ya? Obviously you're the one that Eddie's been telling me about, the big Chuck Heston fan. - Yeah, you could say that. I mean I don't know if Eddie told you about-- - Okay, okay. I know where you're going with this thing so don't strain yourself because this is your special day, you know. Yes, I painted the wheels on his chariot, and yes, I knew Heston. I worked with him on many pictures. - Wait, you actually knew him? - I think I made that pretty clear in my previous statement. - Very clear Ralphie. - Well what was he like? I mean-- - What was he like? He was a regular guy like you and me. Well like me. I mean he caught colds, occasionally got a paper cut. Hey look, if you met the guy-- - It would be the proudest day of my life. - You would meet a regular, nice guy. He paid his dues. He reaped his rewards. - Yes he did. - But he did it with a lot of help from guys like me. - You? - Yeah. - No, no, no, no. Different league, pal. He is the anointed one. He is the man of Soylent Green. The Omega man. - Hey, cool off Cid. - If Sophia Loren were here, she'd slap you. - Hey. Back to the party. Back to the party. - Alright, no, alright, no everything's cool. Everything's-- - I just. - No go on. Go on, I want to hear more about, about how you helped Heston, you rat bastard. - [Group] Hey, Cid. - Hey, we all helped Heston. Me and a cast of thousands behind the scenes. We put the epic in epic. Let me tell you something. The skies I painted for his pictures, you've never seen skies so blue until I painted them. - Ah, the modesty. - There's nothing modest about it. They called me Mr. Magic. I made dreams come true. - Scenic backdrops do not make an epic hero. It takes courage and vision to lead a people. - And a very good script written by fat little four eyed writers, writing lines about liberty and justice. Writers who then drive home, kick the dog, hit the kids, and down a fifth of scotch. [laughter] - Uh huh. - Hey, don't get me wrong birthday boy. Heston was a great actor, but the armies he led followed his every command because page 98 of the script told them to. [slow jazzy music] - Is this guy inspirational or what? - Hey you know Eddie, this wasn't so bad after all. - Hey, it's a party for Christ's sakes. - I'll tell ya, I worked with the best. The Duke. Brando. Elizabeth Taylor and her two magnificent tits. Now they were epic. Ho ho, what jugs. [laughter] - Hey, Ralphie, thanks a lot for coming. - Yeah sure, Eddie, sure. I'll see you guys. - Take it easy Ralphie. [slow jazzy music] Now this was a birthday to remember. - Liz Taylor, I think she's got the flesh eating disease. National Enquirer. [soft music] - [Mama] Cid, El Cid. - [Cid] Yes mama. - [Mama] El Cid, are you succeeding? - [Cid] I don't know. What's it mean to be succeeding, mama? - [Mama] We covered that when you were five, my Cid. - Tell me again. - [Mama] Don't mess with the basics, my son. - I can't be sure, mama. - [Mama] El Cid, are you succeeding? - I don't know, mama. [soft music] - All great art boils down to geometry, weight and gravity. Now let the motorists avoid the dips and rises in the pavement. It's the nomad that dares to ride them out, see what they got to offer when it pops you up and sets you airborne. See, the nomad respects and wrestles with the forces to create something greater. All the forces, the ones you slept through in 11th grade physics, well they back baby. So cuddle up. The G forces, the centripetals, the centrifugals. Now how many can you get working for you when the night holds you in it's grip? Now pay homage, nomad, you fight the natural forces, and they'll break you. Make friends, and they'll set you free. [soft music] - Boys, I'd like to make a proposal. - I hope it's not that thing about switching seats again. - Edward, all I want is a little change. - It's a dead issue, pal. - Now Cid would understand my desire for change. - You don't start playing with natural laws. - Unspeakable. - The nerve. [soft music] - [Tully] Come on, come on. - Beg all you want, Tully, but it ain't happening. Besides, we don't have a quorum. You need a quorum. - Hell, we have a quorum. - There's no quorum. [soft music] - [Poetic Nomad] A streaming of light and sound, she goes and goes like a river flows. [soft music] Mysterious as the Nile, and hollowed as the Ganges. Keeper of the nomad faith. Lifeblood of the perfect ride. [soft music] [dramatic music] - Hey. Yeah. - Have you seen this stick ball that used to be like everywhere, you know. Every day. - I never see it anymore. - You kids don't play. [dramatic music] - Take a load off the floor, Tully. - Yeah, deal with the horrible truth, pal. That's your seat. Tonight and every night. - Goddamn it. [soft music] - [Tully] Anybody seen Cid today? - He'll be here. It's our usual night. - Every night's our usual night. - That's why he'll be here. Where else is he gonna go? - [Mama] Cid, El Cid. - [Cid] Yes mamma? - [Mama] What's going on here? - [Mama] I'm taking a sabbatical, mama. - [Mama] You can't be succeeding in sabbaticing at the same time. Now turn this bucket of rust around and [speaking foreign language] - [Cid] Mama. - [Mama] Yes, my golden child. - [Cid] I want you to listen. I love you very much, but I want you to shut up. [speaking foreign language] - [Mama] I have raised the Devil's child. - [Cid] Now mama, you've got to listen. You've been with me for a long time. I think you must be very tired of raising me for so long. - [Mama] It is a great challenge, yes, but I'm-- - [Cid] I think after all these years, you really deserve some time for yourself. You must be a little tired from looking after your child. You've paid your dues. - [Mama] Yes, my son. I have. - [Cid] You've done a really good job, mama. - [Mama] Thank you my lovely one. - [Cid] So let me go, for a little while. If you stay with me, I may ware you out. - [Mama] And you're gonna be okay? - [Cid] You prepared me well. [laughter] - [Mama] Well, this is a whole new ballgame. Maybe I will take a little vacation with the girls. That would be nice. - [Cid] You deserve it mama. - [Mama] Then, it is settled. So I talk to you in a few months, my beautiful Cid. - [Cid] Take your time, mama. [soft music] - No sign of him. - Maybe he's out drinking with the Asphalt Nomad types. - Hey, he's free to do as he pleases. - Hey, you can't get any freer in this town. [uplifting music] [jazzy music]
