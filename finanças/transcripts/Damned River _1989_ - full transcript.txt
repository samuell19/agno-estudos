ANNE'S A FRIEND OF MINE. SHE'S RAFTED BACK IN THE STATES. A FRIEND OF YOURS? YOU GUYS ARE LIVING TOGETHER. OUR TOOTHBRUSHES ARE LIVING TOGETHER. THIS RIVER CAN BE PRETTY TOUGH. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? HEY, I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING THESE GUYS CAN HANDLE. [SINGING IN BANTU LANGUAGE] HEY, IT'S THE ROCK 'N' ROLL CARAVAN. [SPEAKING BANTU LANGUAGE] CHECK THAT DUDE OUT. YOU TALK ABOUT FULL DRAG. WHAT'S GOING ON? A RAFTER WAS KILLED ON THE RIVER. KILLED? THE VILLAGERS BELIEVE THE RIVER IS A LIVING THING, SO THEY MUST SOOTHE ITS AGITATED SOUL. DOUBT IT DOES ANY GOOD. THE RIVER'S STILL A BITCH AND A HALF. I'M GOING TO GET A PICTURE. LOOK AT THOSE TITS. [HORN HONKS] COME ON, LET'S GO. THE BIG CROCODILES ONLY GET FED ONCE A MONTH. ARE YOU KIDDING? I'VE GOT TO EAT FIVE TIMES A DAY, OR ELSE MY STOMACH STARTS TO DIGEST ITSELF. HEY! HEY! THE CROCS DOWN THE RIVER SOMETIMES GO AS LONG AS A YEAR BETWEEN MEALS. ON THE RIVER? NOT WHERE WE'RE GOING.

I SUPPOSE SHE'S AFRAID BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN. OH, WELL, I'LL BE FINE. NO. THANK YOU. I'LL BE FINE. KEEP YOUR LIFE JACKETS BUCKLED AT ALL TIMES WHILE YOU'RE IN THE RAFT. NOW, SHOULD SOMEONE FALL IN-- SOMEBODY USUALLY DOES-- ROLL ONTO YOUR BACK AND POINT YOUR FEET DOWNSTREAM. THE THREE OF US HAVE RUN QUITE A FEW RIVERS BACK IN THE STATES. HE'S THE ONLY BEGINNER. NOW, IF THE RAFT DOES FLIP, STAY WITH IT AND TRY TO CLIMB ON TOP. IF YOU DO GET SEPARATED FROM THE RAFT, SWIM TO SHORE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S CROCODILES OUT HERE IN THE POOLS BETWEEN THE RAPIDS, AND THEY CAN GET PRETTY NASTY. ONCE YOU GET TO SHORE, STAY WHERE YOU ARE. WE'RE GOING TO BE PASSING THROUGH SOME VERY WILD COUNTRY, UNFRIENDLY AT TIMES, AND YOUR BEST CHANCE OF SURVIVAL IS RIGHT HERE ON THE RIVER. SURVIVAL? WHAT THE HELL IS HE TALKING ABOUT? RELAX, MAN. IT'S JUST THE RAP, LIKE DISNEYLAND, YOU KNOW? NOW, I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL TIMES, OTHERWISE, SERIOUS TROUBLE CAN RESULT. YOU KNOW, COULD I INTERJECT SOMETHING HERE? I'M NOT TOO HIP TO SERIOUS TROUBLE. SERIOUS PARTYING, ABSOLUTELY. SERIOUS TROUBLE, I DON'T THINK SO. HOW MANY CLASS-FIVE RAPIDS WE GOING TO HIT? CLASS-FIVE? YEAH. WELL, ON THIS RIVER, THAT CLASS-FIVE SHIT DOESN'T COUNT. YOU EITHER MAKE IT OR YOU DON'T. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. AND YOUR CLIENTS USUALLY MAKE IT, RIGHT, RAYMOND? LET'S LOAD UP.

WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS TOO MANY TIMES, RAY. I'VE BEEN REAL PATIENT WITH YOU, BUT THAT'S OVER NOW. GREAT. THEN MAYBE I WON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR UGLY ASS ANYMORE. I DON'T THINK I LIKE THIS. THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START A VACATION. A THRILL A MINUTE. DON'T PUSH ME. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET TOUGH. YOU DON'T SCARE ME, VON HOENIGEN. YOU NEVER DID, AND YOU NEVER WILL. TAKE IT EASY, RAY. THIS ISN'T HELPING ANYTHING. SHUT UP. LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. YOU SAID-- I KNOW. I CHANGED MY MIND, OK? THEN YOU FIND YOURSELF ANOTHER MAN. I'M SORRY. I WON'T BE JOINING YOU. ENJOY THE RIDE. HOW COME? I WON'T BE NEEDING HIM ANYWAY. ONCE WE'RE ON THE RIVER, IT'LL ALL BE FORGOTTEN, WON'T IT? WHO WERE THOSE GUYS? THEY'RE NOBODIES.

THERE'S THE LAST TRAIL OUT. 120 MILES TILL THE NEXT ONE. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS FIRST RAPID. WE CALL IT LUCKY SEVEN. SOMETIMES IT'S NOT SO LUCKY. FIRST WE DRIFT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS QUARTER WITH THE BACK END OF THE BOAT TOWARDS ZIMBABWE. WE'RE GOING TO SWIVEL AROUND AND BACK IN BEHIND INDICATOR ROCK, PULLING BACK TOWARDS ZAMBIA. WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT DOWN TO THE MIDDLE OF THE GREEN HIGHWAY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG BURST OF WATER COMING IN ON US. WHOA! WHOA! YEAH! WHOA! WOO! THAT'S LUCKY SEVEN! WOO! ALL RIGHT! YEAH! WOO! THAT MAKES THE COLORADO LOOK LIKE A CREEK. HA HA HA! LOOK, A PETROGLYPH. OH. THAT'S NYAME-NYAME, ZAMBEZI RIVER GUIDE, HAND-CARVED BY THE MATABELE TRIBE HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO. WHAT WAS THAT? ZAM DOLLAR FOR THE RIVER GUIDE. WHEN THEY BUILT THE KARIBA DAM, LOCALS SAY IT SEPARATED NYAME-NYAME FROM HIS WIFE. HE'S BUSTED THE DAM TWO TIMES SO FAR. IT PAYS TO BE ON HIS GOOD SIDE. HOW ROMANTIC. HE FEELS SUCH PASSION FOR HIS WIFE. YEAH, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT KIND OF SHIT. HA HA HA! "WHERE'ER WE TREAD 'TIS HAUNTED, HOLY GROUND; "NO EARTH OF THINE IS LOST IN VULGAR MOULD, "BUT ONE VAST REALM OF WONDER SPREADS AROUND, AND ALL THE MUSE'S TALES SEEM TRULY TOLD..." NERD POLICE! YOU ARE BUSTED! WE'RE TOO FAR AWAY. CAN WE GO BACK? I'D RATHER NOT. WHY NOT? GHOST RIDER'S RIGHT AHEAD UP HERE. WHY CAN'T WE GO BACK? IT'LL JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES. I'LL TELL YOU WHY NOT.

YOU DAMN FOOL. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? I'M SORRY, RAY. I'M SORRY. I GOT A MIND TO THRASH YOU AND SMEAR YOUR FAT FUCKING ASS ALL OVER THIS RIVER LIKE JELLO. HEY, CALM DOWN, RAY. HE JUST LOST HIS BALANCE. THAT'S ALL. WHAT'S THE MATTER? DON'T YOU GET IT? WE ALMOST GOT WASTED BACK THERE. YEAH? WELL, THERE'S WAYS OF DEALING WITH IT WITHOUT FLYING OFF THE HANDLE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. LOOK, I'M SORRY, RAY. IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I'M JUST CLUMSY. THAT'S ALL. HEY, IT WAS JUST A MISTAKE, RAY. THAT TEMPER OF YOURS IS A HELL OF A LOT MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANYTHING HE DID. WELL, I GOT HIS ATTENTION, DIDN'T I? THIS IS LIKE SLAVE LABOR, CARL. I FEEL LIKE I'M ON A CHAIN GANG. THIS IS WORK, JERRY, REMEMBER? THAT THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AND WHAT IS THIS STUFF ABOUT KICKING MY FAT ASS ALL OVER THE RIVER LIKE JELLO? THIS GUY IS LUCKY WE NEED HIM. OTHERWISE, I WOULD KICK HIS BUTT. WHEN YOU GET DONE KICKING HIS BUTT, PUT THESE IN THE OTHER SIDE FOR ME, WILL YOU? OH, NOW YOU, TOO. GREAT. IT'S A CONSPIRACY. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? ABOUT WHAT? RAY BACK THERE IN THE RAPIDS. HE'S A STRANGE GUY. I GUESS IT GOES WITH THE TERRITORY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? CHOOSING TO LIVE OUT HERE, APART FROM SOCIETY. IMAGINE WHAT HE'D DO IF SOMEBODY REAR-ENDED HIM ON THE FREEWAY. I'M NOT SO SURE HE ISN'T RIGHT, THOUGH. ABOUT WHAT? THINK OF ALL THE HASSLES WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. I'LL BET YOU HE DOESN'T EVEN FILE AN INCOME TAX RETURN. RAY WOULD MAKE AN INTERESTING CHARACTER IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS. YEAH, HE WOULD. EARTHY AND POWERFUL. KIND OF AN ANIMALISTIC MAGNETISM LIKE, UH, BUTEAU IN ZOLA'S LA TERRE. YEAH. WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT UP THERE, ANYWAY? WHO? YOU AND LUKE. NOTHING. WE WERE JUST TALKING. HEY, KIDS, WHAT'S FOR DINNER? LOBSTER THERMIDOR. HMM. OH, MY GOD. CROCODILE. WHAT? CROCODILE! OH, JERRY! I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. WHAT A BOZO. UH! UH! SEE? HE DOES THIS SHIT ALL THE TIME.

"FOLLOWING A HEARTY--" THANK YOU-- "AND DELICIOUS MEAL, "AND AN EVENING OF GOOD COMPANIONSHIP"? THAT'S GOT TO BE A MISPRINT. "YOU'LL BE READY FOR A RESTFUL SLEEP "BENEATH THE MYRIAD OF STARS THAT TWINKLE ABOVE ONE OF THE LARGEST AREAS OF UNTRACKED WILDERNESS IN AFRICA." DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING IN THERE ABOUT A COLD CASE OF BREWSKIS AND A COUPLE OF FRENCH STEWARDESSES, DOES IT? YOU KNOW, RAY, I ENVY YOU THIS LIFE, OUT IN THE OPEN, BREATHING CLEAN AIR, PLENTY OF EXERCISE. WOULDN'T BE HARD TO GIVE UP THE LAW FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS. YEAH? WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? MY CAREER. I GOT RESPONSIBILITIES. HOW ABOUT YOU? GOT YOUR LIFE ALL MAPPED OUT, DO YOU? NO, NOT REALLY. TOO MANY THINGS I'M INTERESTED IN JUST TO NARROW IT DOWN. CAN'T MAKE UP YOUR MIND?

SON OF A BITCH IS TRYING TO RUN ME OFF THE RIVER. HOW ABOUT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES? CAN'T THEY HELP YOU OUT? NO, HE'S GOT TOO MANY FRIENDS. I WAS THE FIRST MAN ON THIS RIVER. NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE MY BUSINESS. DON'T SEEM RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW THIS COUNTRY'S BUSINESS LAWS, BUT UNLESS HE'S GOT SOME SORT OF EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO OPERATE ON THE RIVER, ANY INTERFERENCE FROM HIM COULD LEAVE HIM OPEN TO LITIGATION. IN OTHER WORDS, RAY, YOU CAN SUE HIS ASS. SO YOU'RE SAYING I NEED A JUDGE TO TELL ME WHO'S RIGHT? THAT'S WHAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM'S FOR. I ALREADY KNOW WHO'S RIGHT. HEY, THIS FOOD'S REAL GOOD, RAY.
