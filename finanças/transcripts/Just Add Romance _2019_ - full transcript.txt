I got some fresh coriander with your name on it. Ooh, be still my heart. It's coriander, Carley, not roses. I'd rather have the herbs. You're gonna go nuts for the basil. Here you go. Whatever you're making, save me some. You got it. Hey! Hey. Best pretzel in New York City. You got it. Can't be the best and not know it. Hey, it never hurts to be reminded. Thanks, Tony! You're late! So are you. Not as late as you. How can you be chivalrous and competitive at the same time? What can I say? I'm a complicated guy. Mint in your bouillabaisse? Really? I don't have your loyalty to the recipe. I cook by instinct. Oh, like your Duck a L'Orange that turned into Duck a la Carley? Better than the tedium in an orange sauce that you advocate. Not every dish has to end in a battle of wits. How about a truce until the next course? You take eyeballing ingredients to a whole new level. It puts the art in cooking. And too much oil. No one ever measured their way to a Michelin star. Make sure your broth doesn't get too thick. Uh oh. You might have to improvise. Bouillabaisse is not your best look. I guess the truce is over. Hey, we made bouillabaisse today. Those shallots, they should be paper thin. I'm sorry, Carley, we're packed tonight. I don't have much time. You needed to tell me something? Yeah. I'm up for an apprenticeship with Francine Durant in Paris. Well, that's wonderful, sweetheart. You could learn a lot from her. Yeah, I'm really excited. You know, we're old friends, I could drop a word for- Oh, no, no, I want to do this on my own. Thanks. As you wish. Cast a long shadow. Perhaps I could just give you one word of advice? Yes, Chef. Francine runs a very tight kitchen. Don't get too adventurous. Let's just see if she chooses me and then you can start with the lecturing, Dad. Fair enough. Alright, everyone. Today we are making Coquille St. Jacques. Congrats on Paris. Oh, thanks. Yeah, Francine Durant is like my culinary idol. Uh, excuse me, where is Jason? I'm afraid he won't be returning to class. I don't get it. Why would he just leave? Yeah, he didn't even say goodbye. I wonder what happened. I'm headed for the airport now. You really don't have to do this. Always come through for you, Dad. We'll see you when you get to Chicago. Alright. Bye. Hi. Laguardia. Great. A little bit more basil in the pesto. And just make sure that the batter doesn't overwhelm the shrimp. Hey. The Tortellini Primavera is really good tonight. It's the same every night, same recipe, same ingredients. That's the deal with a chain. Familiar matters as much as taste. I've been general manager of this place forever and we've never had a better chef. Thank you. I understand your frustration. Sometimes I just wanna go wild and make an unconventional, unpredictable, outside of the box primavera. I'll take it up with management. Did you see Kitchen Showdown last night? It's the best cooking contest on the air. The winner gets to open their own restaurant. They're coming to Chicago and looking for the best local chefs. I know. I have tasted your cooking. I'm confident you have a shot. Oh, get more of that Sicilian olive oil. It is remarkably rich. And remarkably expensive. Kent. It is the attention to detail that makes the dish. Were you that discerning with your burgers and fries at the diner? Diners are great. Especially my dad's. I have been over a hot grill but taught me a lot. Okay. I worked for a lot of chefs and they all had one thing in common. The best ingredients money can buy. I should bring in my accountant and do a taste test. Kent would use canned vegetables and paper plates if he could. You should go on Kitchen Showdown, get your own restaurant and take me with you. I'm not kidding. I would be competing with some of the top chefs in this city. I do not have enough experience. Bail us both out before Kent goes the paper plate route. Hey, you could get a job in any kitchen you wanted to. I'd rather do my slicing and dicing for a chef I believe in. Send in an application. What could it hurt? ♪ Do, do, woo, do-do La, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Do, do, woo, do-do La, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ When you showed up, my world was steady ♪ ♪ Now, you givin' a little twist to the story, ♪ ♪ I'm not worryin' about the endin' ♪ ♪ Cause it's everything in between that has meaning ♪ ♪ That feeling, ♪ ♪ It's a dangerous thrill ♪ ♪ That feeling, ♪ ♪ When you're out of control. ♪ This is why I am so glad we are neighbours. I couldn't watch TV without it. So, Kitchen Showdown is coming to Chicago, and I applied. If I could win that contest and get my own restaurant that would shave years off of my game plan. What's a game plan? A plan for something you want to happen. When Carley and I were in high school we both knew what we wanted to be. That's right. Your mom was gonna be an architect and I wanted to be a chef. So far we're doing pretty good. I have a game plan. I want a dog. That's not exactly the same thing. Well, I wanna get a dog anyway. It's all she talks about. It's part of her game plan. I think it's working. I'm about to give in. Welcome to Kitchen Showdown: New York Edition. We go all over the country looking for the best chefs. The winner in each city will be given the backing to open a restaurant. It's a big prize and the competition can get pretty intense. I think you're gonna win. All you have to do is make this popcorn. You're my favourite food critic. Hi. Oh, uh, yeah. Great. Sure. Okay. See you then. Bye. I take it that wasn't the show. It was my dad. He's coming into town and he wants to have lunch. How long since you've seen him? Six months. Hey, how old do I have to be before I stop needing his approval? Give it another hundred years. But you love him, right? With all my heart. Then you should be happy. She makes a good point. She does. Let's go watch the show. So how's your mother? She likes living in Vancouver. She and Henry just bought a boat. Um... what brings you to Chicago? I'm doing some consulting work for a company that wants to re-brand their restaurants. They're headquartered here, so you're going to be seeing more of me. You remember that game we used to play? The one I had to pick the secret ingredient out in the dressing? Like it was yesterday. Every memory that I have of you and me from when I was a kid is in a kitchen. Well, to be truthful, I didn't know what to do when you came for a visit. You seemed to like it. I loved it. Yes, you did. Until your rebellious teens. I was trying to define myself. Oh, was that it? Yeah. As I recall you put anchovies in a frittata and I call that rebelling. Oh, the things a girl won't do to get her father's attention. So, what's going on in your life? Well, I um... I just applied to be a contestant on Kitchen Showdown. Have you ever watched it? I um, I really don't have the time. Is that code for "I don't approve"? Carley, you cook to give joy and pleasure, not for the notoriety. Yeah. It's just a shortcut to getting my own restaurant. It's ginger. That's what gives this dressing its kick. I also detect a dash of lime. Let's make a habit of this. I really hope to get back more often. I would love that. Me too. Wow, those are impressive looking omelettes, dad. Well, sometimes I like to dabble in the fancier fare. You are the best cook I know. Your mother has a crush on me. Yeah, I've noticed. Here. Thanks Mom. Okay. So how are things down at the restaurant? Well, you know, my staff is great. My boss isn't easy. Yeah, well, someday you'll be your own boss. So do you guys know that show, Kitchen Showdown? Oh yeah, I watch it all the time. Yeah, when we sold the diner your father discovered the TV. Well, they're coming to Chicago. Oh! You gotta get on. Yeah. I applied, and it's- it's a long shot, but if they're interested they show up at my restaurant unannounced and try the food. So far, nothing. No, no, no. Maybe they've been there and you just didn't know it. Yeah. I don't know, it's a long shot and my boss, Kent, he's hard enough to please without me asking for extra time off. I think this is something you really want. To prove you've got the goods, which I already know, but maybe you don't. You know, you came back to take care of the diner when I broke my arm, and that's something I still carry with me to this day. Maybe this is your chance to make up for lost time. Maybe. But it's a long shot. Well, sometimes those are the best kind. Thanks. Hey Carley, how's it tasting? Mmm. I don't think that has enough kick. Every day feels like an audition. I don't even know if the show is sending anyone to check me out. Not even my lucky apron is calming me down. What makes it so lucky? My dad gave it to me before I started culinary school. "Cook from the heart. Love, Dad." It's a little show of faith. At least that's what I like to think it meant. I'm sure it did. Do you think the guy in the grey suit could be from the show? He's my dentist. How about the red vest? He doesn't look like the TV type. Ooh, green dress, striped tie. They just arrived. Let me see what I can find out. The green dress mentioned Kitchen Showdown and they ordered some very good wine. I knew it! Now I have to go cook for them. You'll be fine, assuming you don't pass out before the main course. A waiter told the Maitre'd that someone from Kitchen Showdown was at the restaurant last night? Oh, I... I didn't know they were here. Where does this leave me? Well, Jason can lay out all the menus and I can pinch hit while he's gone. Oh, mmm-mmm. Lots of people watch the show. The publicity could be good for business. Yeah, it doesn't mean I'll get picked. Oh, but you're hoping awfully hard that you do. I guess, yeah. Alright, if you do get on, mention this restaurant every chance you get. Of course. I can't wait to tell my dad. He's gonna be over the moon. Well, well, well. I finally caved. Her name is Daisy. She's very friendly. And she's very cute. Excuse me. Hello? Is this Carley Benson? Hi. It's my pleasure to inform you that you've been selected to appear on Kitchen Showdown. I can't believe it! This is such great news! I guess I can stop holding my breath now. Thank you so much. We start production on Monday and you'll receive an email with all of the information. Good luck. Thanks. I'm gonna be on the show! I am so happy for you! Okay, you'll meet the other contestants and then we'll do a quick orientation. Are you ready, Carley? Yes. Okay. Okay. Let me introduce you to the other contestants. This is Winston, Suzanne, Tina, and Peter. This is Carley. Hey. I thought there was supposed to be six chefs in the contest. Hi. Oh, here he is now. This is Jason. You're late. It has been a long time. Yes. What are the odds we'd end up on the same show together? Pretty slim. You think? Mmmhmm. Oh, uh, sorry. We were in culinary school together. And then you disappeared. Well, now here I am. Oh, and you all know Beverly Chadwick. She is the host of our show and she's also one of the judges. You are six of the best chefs in Chicago. It's a competition, but let's keep it fun and respectful. It's a six-day shoot and you'll have very long hours, but the prize of your own restaurant is well worth it. And if you have any questions just come to me. Win or lose, try to make the most of this experience. Guess we're gonna be spending a lot of time together. Yeah. Until one of us gets cut. I wish you the best. And I wish you the same. Try saying that with a straight face. You're not buying the smile? I really wanna win this thing. It's so funny you should say that. I do too. Lights, camera, cook your heart out. Yeah, it is a bit daunting. Yeah. A dream kitchen, though. All the measuring cups you could ever need. All the counter space you'll need for your random ingredients. Okay, we're gonna start shooting your intros. It's a way for the audience to get to know you. I have a rather large resume. Well, the intros are short and sweet. It's more about your personalities. I don't do sweet. Oh. Tina, why did you become a chef? I'm from New Orleans and food is a way of life. So uh, what did you do after culinary school? I went to work in my dad's diner. Yeah, it's a long story. So what about you? Um, I got a job working for Francine Durant in Paris. Wow. Yeah. Why did you choose this career? I grew up near the best restaurant in London, so I suppose it was fate. So what brought you to Chicago? I got a job as head chef at Cafe Pierre. And also my best friend lives here so I figured it felt like a good move. I'm the oldest of three sisters. My parents both worked so I became the cook. By the time I grew up I was hooked. Do you have any family here? Just a goddaughter that I borrow sometimes. And the occasional visit from my father. Uh... Mmm. I was going to be a lawyer and then I fell in love with cooking. So I cast off my tie and put on an apron. It's a much better fit. Well, I guess one of us is next. Yeah. You nervous? Does it show? Only when you speak. What made you become a chef? Well, my folks owned a diner so I guess it's in the genes. Growing up my mom used to take a picture of every dish I'd make and put it in a photo album. I apprenticed with a lot of top chefs but nobody loved feeding people as much as my dad. Why did you decide on cooking? Well, I spent half my childhood in the kitchen. While other kids were playing house I was playing restaurant. Strange she didn't mention her father. Maybe she... fears the comparison. It's a lot to live up to. It just always felt right to me. Like it was what I was supposed to be doing. I guess that went okay. Yeah. Diner to head chef. Pretty impressive. Alright, everyone. Your call time is 8:00am tomorrow, and then you'll meet the other judges, and then we'll start shooting the first show. Alright, have a good night. You know, culinary school seems like ages ago. But I still remember your Duck a la Carley. And I still remember you wearing your bouillabaisse. Wow, it's weird to be competing again after all this time. I wasn't competing. Okay. And my duck was not defying, it was creative and original. And a little too salty. Well, your duck was completely by the book. But you remember it. No, I don't, and that's my point. Memorable requires risk. And too much salt. Those two are gonna be fun to watch. How'd it go? Hi. Uh, good, I think. Tomorrow we meet the judges. I'm kinda nervous they're just gonna see me as Kenneth Benson's daughter. You got there on your own merit. Everywhere I go in the culinary world I'm followed by his five-star reputation and judged accordingly. It's kinda how I judge myself. You're passionate and gifted. You'll make your own mark. Thank you, for almost making me believe that. Now I have to go make my daughter believe she can play the piano. I think Winston's the one to beat. What's the deal with Carley? Carley's very talented but she ignores the recipe and just wings it. She is incredibly stubborn when it comes to doing things her own... way. Jason doesn't think freedom or creativity matter all that much. I also said you were incredibly talented. Oh. Morning, everyone. What did I miss? Just Jason's assessment of my cooking. Oooh. Hey, guys. Uh, they need you in the studio. It's time to meet the judges. Come on. I'm pleased to introduce my fellow judges. The legendary chef, Rafael Nola. The best of you are here to learn. I will be fair and brutally honest. And the woman backing the winner in opening a restaurant, Nora Blasio. You know, before I was a restauranteur I was a chef, so I know how it feels to be in your shoes right now. One of you will be eliminated after the first round. Try to focus on the cooking, not the result. Get yourselves prepared, we're gonna shoot the opening segment. Nice to meet you. Hi, Winston. Good morning. Carley Benson, you're Kenneth's daughter, yes? That's right. You may not remember this but we met when you were a little girl. No, I do. I remember, yeah. Please give your father my regards. I will. Small world. Oh, we met once. I was nine. He's hardly a close friend. You know, I actually used to be a sous chef in one of Nora's restaurants. We all have some connection with the judges. We always like to honour the cuisine of the city we're in, and you can't get more iconic than Chicago. Your first assignment is to make a dish that got its start here. Good luck. Okay, you have 30 minutes to do all of your shopping. What if they don't have the seafood I need? Well, then you'll have to improvise. That's part of the contest. Okay, ready? Alright, get set, go shopping! How much more time? 22 minutes. I love this place. It's my favourite market in the city. My sous chef normally does my shopping. Who has the best shrimp? Try Matty's, it's right around the corner. Following me? I could ask you the same question. This is a cooking show not a foot race. Actually, it's both. Pepperoni? That's right. Me too. Are you two together? Absolutely not. Could you give us a minute? Absolutely not together but you need a minute? Yeah. What're you making? Deep dish pizza. Me too. Well, we can't make the same thing. Well, what do you suggest? Well, I'm really good at winging it, so I guess I can use all the same ingredients and make pizza puffs a la Chicago. You figure out what you want? Yes, my own restaurant. Me too. I'll come back when you work this out. That's okay, we'll take two pounds of pepperoni, spicy for me, mild for him. I need to get this in the oven. How do you work like that? You mean without all of my ingredients alphabetized? I need more onion. Hey. Filed under "O", where it belongs. Thank you. I wouldn't want you blaming a missing onion when I win. Less talking, more cooking. That's how you chop an onion? That's how you knead dough? They can't help themselves. The deep-dish pizza... was right on point. The crust and the sauce. The Shrimp De Jonghe was well executed. The sauce can be tricky. The pizza puffs, Chicago staple. But the prosciutto just gave it this wonderful twist. I'm afraid we all had a problem with your thinly sliced beef sandwich. The meat was overcooked and the sauce was rather bland. The first showdown is over. Peter... it's time to leave the kitchen. At least I got to take a shot, huh? See ya. Bye. Try and get some rest. Tomorrow we shoot the next round. Here's the upside of being the first one cut. It'll make a great story when I open up my incredibly popular restaurant someday. Well, I will be the first in line. Just don't order the thinly sliced beef. Okay. All the jokes are to cover up how much he cares. What? That's very insightful. Don't sound so surprised. You really know how to take a compliment. You two bicker like an old married couple. He is right, and you know, if one of you two wins this contest it's not gonna be pretty. Your next assignment is a bit mo Each of you will make a dish that represents your heritage. The kind of food you grew up with. And you'll be serving it to your families who are coming to visit. My son is 10. He's going to love being on TV. You okay? Oh, yeah. I'm just wondering if my dad's coming. His opinion matters... to me. Carley... We're about to head for the market. I keep changing my mind about what I'm gonna make. Whatever I pick my dad's already done it and better. Oh, hey, he won't see it that way. I bet he's proud of you. Becoming a chef like him? I don't know. I hope so. You're trying too hard. Just make something you had when you were a kid. Go for the memory. Not the gold. Thanks. Of course. See ya. See ya. Chicken Kiev. Hey, there's my mom and dad. Is your dad here? Uh, I don't know. Hey. That's my brother, Reggie, and my grandma. Hey, isn't that your dad? It's so good to see you again. Rafael, it's been too long. Hello, Kenneth. Oh, Beverly. You look lovely. It's the lighting. One of the perks of being on camera. Not a chance. Hey. You got this. Stop being so nice to me. We're in competition. Ahhh! Try to relax. I don't seem relaxed to you? No. What's this called again? Beef Wellington, named after the Duke of Wellington, who was vaguely related to your great-grandfather. It looks really good. Your technique has improved considerably. Carley was 11 when she attempted to make a Chicken Kiev for my birthday. And as I recall she used two pounds of butter in the centre. You've come a long way. I'm really glad you like it. You know, in the diner we call this the 'Monday Night Special'. Yeah, except it didn't have the bacon or the porcini mushrooms. Boy, I-I don't know how it gets better than this. You know what? I should take a picture. Oh, no, mom, they're filming this. I think we're covered. No, no. This one's just for us. This is a meal to remember. Perfect. You know, when Jason turned 15 I got him a suit and we went to the best restaurant in the city just so he could know how good food could be. And look at him now. That was the night I knew I wanted to be a chef. I like the Beef Wellington. The texture of the puff pastry shell? Though not entirely traditional, your Chicken Kiev was quite good. Suzanne, your savoury ham and cheese crepes were delicious. Tina, we were very torn about this decision, but the flavours in your Gumbo did not have sufficient time to marry. The second showdown is over. It's time to leave the kitchen. Well, I learned a lot and I had a great experience, thanks. Yeah. Bye. Bye-bye. Hey. Hey. I'm not gonna lie. This one hurts. I know. But you were short on time, not talent. It's just my grandmother was here. I know. I've seen the way she looks at you. You can do no wrong in her eyes. Do not let this shake your confidence. Uh, me and my brother, we're talking about getting a food truck. Maybe I could have a restaurant on wheels. Yeah. I think that's a really great idea. Thank you, Carley. I really mean that. Yeah. Okay, you guys can go home. Make sure you get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day. It can't be any more challenging than today. I need a warm bath and a glass of wine. Do you wanna get a coffee? This evening? Who drinks coffee at night when there's so much on the line? I mean, if I drink coffee after 8:00 pm it's impossible for me to sleep and I don't know if you've noticed but my engine runs pretty high so it's- Well, a beverage is optional, you and your engine can have decaf. Today was so intense. I was a nervous wreck. In culinary school you were so polished. The designer clothes, the famous father. I find the nerves kind of refreshing. You were only there for a month. That's hardly long enough for you to know my life story. I'm just saying you surprised me. I washed dishes and worked as a prep chef just like you. And just so you know, my ignoring the recipe is not arrogance. I never said it was. Things aren't always as they seem. In my dad's kitchen everyone would always say "Yes Chef" and I didn't wanna be a yes man. I wanted to stand out, so I started to rebel, and after a while bending the recipes became like a... badge of honour. It was my way, not his. I needed to do something on my own. I- I didn't mean to pry. So, how about you and your vanishing act? Why did you so mysteriously disappear from school? It wasn't mysterious. It was to me. Oh, so you thought of me. No. Not much. But I'd still like to know. Well, my dad broke his arm and the doctor said he couldn't work for three months. I couldn't let him shut down the diner for that long so I went back home and manned the grill. Family is really important to me. That's not what I was expecting. Good for you. You know I guess I tend to be a little more traditional in the kitchen. I guess I tend to follow classic recipes in lieu of a fancy culinary degree. You don't need a degree. You're really good. So we're both second generation cooks. Mmmhmm. And so different in the kitchen. Well, you know what they say about opposites. They both want their own restaurant? I know one thing we have in common. We both love blueberry pie. I love blueberry pie. It's my favourite pie. We should um, go for coffee more often. They sent us home to pack a bag. The next challenge is at a resort on Lake Michigan and uh, the contestants are gonna be cooking comfort food for the guests. How cool is that? I know. And I saw photos of the resort online. Amazing. It's right on the lake. Mmm. Try and have some fun. I'm not gonna be on the lake I'm gonna be in the kitchen. Take this just in case. As you wish. You should wear that dress and those shoes. To cook in? Do as your stylist says. Okay. Thank you. ♪ Diving in ♪ ♪ While the currents fast ♪ ♪ Gotta leave the past, it's in the past ♪ ♪ Yeah, I won't look back ♪ ♪ Strike a match ♪ ♪ Watch the flames go higher ♪ ♪ We can burn much brighter ♪ ♪ If we don't look back. ♪ When do we see the kitchen? This is gonna be a fun adventure. Too many variables in an unfamiliar kitchen. I don't want anything to throw me off my game. I can understand that. I wish there was time to go hiking. I have allergies. Nature isn't my thing. Being a chef, taking that as far as I can, that's what I'm all about. Everything else I can take or leave. Oh yeah, I'm the same way. I wonder if I have time for a run. It's beautiful here. Seen one lake, seen them all. I really like this assignment. I can return to my diner roots. Comfort is a warm blanket. Food should be elegant and sophisticated. And maybe taste good? You sound just like my son. Well, he's a good kid. He's the light of my life. Zoe wants to see us in the lobby. Right now. Hey, guys. Hi. So Beverly got caught up in meetings and missed her flight. She gets in tonight so we'll start shooting in the morning. What will we do in the meanwhile? You get the rest of the day off. Seriously? That's great. I think I'll take a nap. Alright. Hey. Hi. I'm uh, going for a run. I'm going for a hike. Do you mind if I join? Yeah, okay. Let's go this way. I bet the view is beautiful. Oh, I think we should follow the trail. This isn't the kitchen. Let's take the uncharted path. I go hiking every chance I get. When you spend all of your time in a kitchen the great outdoors feels like paradise. That's why I go running every morning in the park. Another thing we have in common. We also wanna make our fathers proud. And we both have the same dream, opening a restaurant. Do you ever picture Chez Carley? What it would be like? I think about it all the time. I want it to feel like home. Personal and inviting, the food an extension of that invitation. Candles, fresh cut flowers on every table. How about Chez Jason? Well, it's got the candles. Mmmhmm. Plush seating. Friendly staff because they're well paid. You work in a diner long enough and you realize how important that is. Yeah. Organized kitchen, of course. And the best food you've ever had. The thing is, our dreams are about to collide. Well, it could be Chez Winston. Yeah. See? Wasn't this worth it? Both trails lead to the same place. Do you wanna get dinner? Oh, it might feel a little bit like a date. You still have to eat. That's true. Just a couple of pals stranded in paradise trying to kill time. Where are you going? Oh, uh, to eat dinner with Jason. We're just grabbing a bite. So you don't mind if I join you? No, that'd be great. I already ate. Have fun. But not too much fun, he's still the competition! You look very pretty, for a pal who's just killing some time. Well, my stylist made me pack this dress and she's very insistent. She's seven, but still. She has very good taste. Thank you. I remember our first day of culinary school. So do I. We made the chocolate soufflé. Mine died in the oven. I was very aware of you and, to be completely honest, I had a bit of a crush on you. Why didn't you ever ask me out? I was about to. And then you left. And now here we are. Which is where, exactly? Let's find out. I'm having a really good time. So am I. Though I'm not sure that's such a good thing given our circumstances. Well, our circumstances are we're going for a walk. No harm in that. I guess our timing's off a bit. A couple years. What would you have said? If I asked you out? I would have said yes. I would have taken you out for dinner. Kinda like we did tonight? And then I would have walked you home, kind of like this. And then what? I would have kissed you goodnight. Like this. You act like you've ever seen a mixer before. I find it more comforting than the stares. Everybody knows what happened. Ah. Good point. I don't know what to do. Well, just focus on the cooking and the fascinating mixer. I knew they had dinner last night. Might work to our advantage if they get distracted by one another. That's a bit cynical, isn't it? But I question their priorities. It's certainly getting them a lot of attention. This is not the kind of attention that we want to be getting. It was just a kiss. We didn't break any rules. A romance between competing chefs. This has never happened before. I think it's kind of sweet. Until one of them loses out to the other. It won't affect the judging but it'll be a bit more dramatic. I think that we should keep our distance. Just until the competition is done. Okay. Otherwise it's just- it's too complicated. Yeah, I... I get it. Complicated. Um... Yeah. I hope we're not interrupting anything. No, nothing... nothing at all. It's time to go shopping. We're going to the local market. It's very well stocked. Great. Make sure you capture enough footage of our cute couple. Where's the olive oil? I hope they have pearl onions. I can't find the cheese that I want. What're you making? Shepherd's Pie. All of these are too strong, they'll overpower it. Try this Gruyere. It's pretty mild. You don't need it? I got enough. What're you making? Macaroni and cheese. I made it a million times in the diner. Thanks. And hey, to return the favour I'd like to offer some unsolicited advice. Okay. Since you know the dish so well, get creative. No rules, no recipe, just follow your instincts and see where it leads you. I don't know how that came off, but it was meant well. That's how it was taken. This episode is getting really good. The oven is overheating. My lasagne is curling around the edges. It says 350. My chicken pot pie looks okay. Maybe it's the wine in your bolognese sauce. And maybe it's the oven. The final decision is up to the judges but it helps if the hotel guests enjoy your dish. He's trying the mac and cheese. Mmmhmm. This looks really good. He looks happy, right? He's going for a second scoop. She keeps staring at the Shepherd's Pie. Why? Why the hesitation? Who doesn't like a biscuit crust? The guests were very pleased and their feedback will be taken into consideration. Now it's time to give you our decision. Your diner background served you well. The mac and cheese was exceptional. And the biscuit-topped Shepherd's Pie was comforting yet sophisticated. Your dish, the chicken pot pie, succeeded on every level. I was impressed. Winston. The lasagna bolognese was a bit highbrow for the assignment. I think that's open to interpretation. That was not the only problem. It was overcooked. Due to a faulty oven. No one else had any complaints. Perhaps my dish was more ambitious. Which brings us back to your questionable choice. The third showdown is over. It's time to leave the kitchen. I'm afraid so. Thank you. Pack your bags. We're headed back to Chicago for the next round. I'm really sorry, Winston. I appreciate the sentiment, but what's done is done. It's not just about pride, you know. I want my son to think highly of me, not see me defeated on television. I'm the son of a cook and I admire his ability in the kitchen but I love him because he's my father. And that love is forever. You know, if you weren't so talented and still a contender I think we could have been friends. We already are. You just riding up and down hoping to run into me? Yeah, something like that. I know this wasn't a vacation but I had a really good time. Not just the uh, setting, but the company. Yeah, I'm really gonna miss this place. Me too. We really need to work on our timing. Yeah. Thank you. You're back! I am. I gather you had a good time? It was wonderful. It was magical. Complicated. That sounds intriguing. I got pretty close to one of the chefs. Did you wear the outfit I picked out? I did. I told you. Yeah, it was a hit. I should have you dress me more often. Hey, Dad. Hi. Um, I was here for some meetings and wanted to see you but, well, now I have to leave. Oh, I was with Kitchen Showdown, they took us out of town. I'm so sorry I missed you. Well, maybe next time. Is everything okay? Oh, sure. I'm-well, I just miss you, that's all. I miss you, too. More than I let on. I'll try and get back soon. Kent. I've been trying to reach you. Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry, I was out of town with the show. It's been over a week. Frankly, I thought you'd be eliminated by now. Is he still in the contest? Well, so did I. Look, I will check in with you every day. I have to go. I have a restaurant to run. I... Hi. Hi. You made it to the final three. Congratulations. Thanks. Do you have a minute? Sure. It's about Carley and Jason and their relationship. It's an interesting twist. I'm just afraid they'll get more attention from the judges. Well, don't worry. The next round of the competition is blind. The judges won't know who made what dish. So just concentrate on your cooking. Hey. Hello. You'll be creating a dish that is typical of classic French cuisine. Since the contest is blind you will each get a sous chef. Hey. You'll be picking names out of a hat. Here you go. Okay. Peter. Hey. Winston. Hey. Okay, everybody. Let's get cooking. So uh, me and my brother are gonna do it. We're getting a food truck. Tina, that's great! Yeah. We're gonna call it "The Big Easy" and we're gonna bring New Orleans to the mid-west. Your grandmother is gonna love that. Oh yeah. Hey, how are things going here? Looks like it's getting pretty intense. Yeah, I'm trying to focus on the cooking, not the competition. Zoe did say that you and Jason have become more than just competitors. Well, whatever we are, it's on hold until after the competition. Okay, understood. You're using pancetta? Yeah. And cognac. I'm gonna make the judges a Beef Bourguignon they're never gonna forget. I like it. Mmm. How's things going? A lot of pressure but I'm hanging in there. You're doing something right. I really want this. You could win it. It's just the three of you now. Yeah, I just-I worry how that would play out with Carley. Oh, so the rumour is true. It's more than just a rumour. I really like her. It's quite a dilemma. The restaurant or the girl. I like Carley and Jason, I really do. But neither of them is ready to have their own restaurant. Apparently, the judges don't share your opinion. Although they did have the profound misjudgement to eliminate me. This flirtation they're having illustrates my point. They don't understand what's at stake. Forget about them and pay more attention to your congealing sauce. I always enjoy the blind contest. It adds a layer of mystery to the judging. It's easy to get sidetracked by the personalities of the chefs, their story. We'll begin with the Cassoulet. Mmm. The proportions are exactly right. Subtle and yet compelling. This belongs on the menu. I gather you're the Cassoulet. That would be me. Congrats. Thanks. Now, the Beef Bourguignon. It's very good. It takes a moment to adjust to the contrasting flavours. Pancetta can be a bit overwhelming, but not in this case. I don't agree. There's no respect for the classic French dish. The chef has taken too many liberties. I'm fine. Really. This is so incredibly stressful. Our last dish is the Coq Au Vin. There's no surprises but the execution shows real skill. This is a traditional Coq Au Vin, very much in keeping with the assignment. The sauce is everything in a Coq Au Vin. I find it too creamy. You can take a break while the judges deliberate. Try and relax. I'll be back shortly. Well, I don't know how we're supposed to relax. I've never felt so unrelaxed in my life. I know what you mean. What do you have to be unrelaxed about? You're safe in this round. Not necessarily. Hey, your dish was a home run. You should worry about winning, and you're worried about each other. The judges are ready. Welcome back. We still don't know who made which dish, but we are ready to give you our decision. The Cassoulet was exceptional, we all agreed on that, right? The Coq Au Vin was authentically French, but I had a problem with the consistency of the sauce. The Beef Bourguignon had too many components. There's a fine line between creative and over the top. Please, stand next to your dish. Oh, you made the Cassoulet. Well done. The Coq Au Vin, and the Beef Bourguignon. The voting was very close. The fourth showdown is over. Suzanne... It's time to leave the kitchen. Thank you for the opportunity. Now it's head to head. One of you is about to get your own restaurant. And the other one goes home. How do you feel? Uh, scared, happy, everything in between. Uh, what she said. Go home, get some rest. Tomorrow we shoot the show that's gonna change one of your lives. If the viewers will feel exactly like me. They'll root for them both. Only one can win. I hate cliff-hangers. Everyone should have a happy ending. It's a cooking contest, not a romance novel. Still opening doors for me, huh? What can I say, old habits die hard. Competitive and chivalrous. So, tomorrow's the big day. Yeah. Suddenly "good luck" seems so conflicted. Maybe I'll call you later? Just to see how you're doing? Maybe you shouldn't. I mean, you can call me. You don't have to. It's up to you. You sound like how I feel. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Hey, Kent. We need to talk in person. I'd like you to come to the restaurant. Okay, I'll see you soon. Hey. Hey. Look who's here. Yeah, well uh, Kent wanted to see me. Hey, what's going on with the show? Only two of us left. That's what I'm talking about. Yes! Hello, Jason. A word? This contest has put things in perspective for me- And it's almost over. And then what? I mean, if you win you'll be opening your own restaurant. Well, there's a 50/50 chance I'll lose. Let's be honest. You and I were never a good fit. So I've hired another chef. You're firing me? Now? You can't do that. I'm sorry it had to end this way. But I think it's for the best. Usually baking really helps me relax. Is it working? Not at all. I only have one day until I find out if my dream is coming true. I can't think about that or else I won't sleep. I can't even imagine the pressure. Hey, it's almost your bed time. One more cookie. They're so good. You promised to show us the pictures from your trip. You're right, I did. Okay, let's see. This is me and my friend, Jason. He looks nice. He is. He's the other chef. Tomorrow it's him or me. And you like him. I do. Even if you win he could still be your friend. I really hope so. Okay, no. Now it's time to go home to bed. Goodnight, Emma. I hope you get everything you want. Thank you. Thanks. I was just about to call you. I just wanted to say goodnight and good luck. That sounds so stupid. How're you doing? I've been better. Do you wanna go for a walk or something? It might take some of the pressure off tomorrow. We'd have to walk a hundred miles. Well, how about we start with a few blocks and see how it goes? Alright, 99 more miles and I should be good. Yeah, I needed to get out of my head for a while, too. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I... Yeah, go ahead. Hey, Hannah. I just quit in protest. I can't let you do that. Kent had no right to fire you like that, with no warning? I don't know what to say. I just wanted you to know how much you mean to your staff. I feel the same way. Well, that's it. Have a good night. Bye. Who's Hannah. My sous chef. She just quit her job. Why would she do that? Well, she thought it was unfair that I got fired. You got fired from the restaurant? I wasn't happy there. Besides, I might have my own restaurant tomorrow. Just when it seemed things couldn't get any more complicated. Maybe we shouldn't talk about the contest. It seems unavoidable. How about the unavoidable subject of you and me? You and me? I like the sound of that. No matter what happens we'll be okay. I wish you the best tomorrow. Maybe second best. Hmm. I wish you the same. I thought you went back to New York. Well, I decided to stay a little longer. Thanks. Yeah, come on in. Just breathe. So uh, how's the show going? Uh, well, we're down to two chefs so I'm, you know, I'm a little bit rattled, but I guess that's pretty obvious. Um... so what're you- what're you doing here? Well, I uh, I thought we could talk. Oh, you wanna-right now-okay. I'm retiring, Carley. I gave my notice to the restaurant. Wow. Why-uh, why didn't you tell me? Just waiting for the right time. The uh... the right words. I hung up my spatula and took a good look at my life and I want to see more of my daughter. That's why I took the job in Chicago. Wow, that's uh, that's a lot to take in. I- I miss you. I want you to be in my life. I... I Um, I'm just feeling a little... I don't know how I'm feeling. I guess overwhelmed? Because of the contest. Uh, yeah. Carley, I am very proud of you. I hope you know that. I'm-I'm sorry I haven't said that enough. Actually, that was a-a first. Whether you win or lose I'd feel the same way. I still wanna win. No, it's just... see, this whole time I thought it was about proving myself to you but I guess I'm the one that needed the proof. Huh. Who knew? Hmm. So who's the other chef? His name's Jason. The one from the diner. Yeah. We've gotten pretty close. Oh, I see. But you know, I mean, having a restaurant, it's what I've been working so hard for. I look at the choices I made in my life and the times I put career before family and what it cost me and I think well, maybe... maybe it doesn't have to be one or the other. Maybe you can have it all. I guess the question is how. Yes, well, you know what? I think you'll figure that one out. I've got a lot of faith in you. And you should, too. I'm really happy you're here. Oh, me too, honey. Me too. You're late. Thank you. The last show's always the hardest. You nervous? Afraid so. Does it show? Well, the finale will air in two months, right before the restaurant opens. It'll be a great send-off. I'll give you two a minute before we start shooting. Thanks. If you name an emotion, I'm feeling it. Me too. Everybody's watching us. Yeah, watching us and filming. Okay, everybody. Let's get this show on the road. This is the final showdown and there is a lot on the line. No pressure. For your final assignment you'll be making your best dish. Choose something that reflects your passion and your expertise. Our former contestants will be assisting you in the kitchen. Hi. You'll each choose a wooden spoon numbered one and two to see who picks first. After you. Tina. Winston. Suzanne. Boys against girls, awesome. It's only awesome if you're on the winning side. Now, this last round is pretty intense, but performing under pressure is a vital part of running a restaurant. We wish you both the best of luck. Okay. I don't know why each of you requires two assistants. They always bring back the other contestants to add to the drama. Yeah. Just what we need, more drama. Figure out what you're making. That's half the battle. I hate to think of it as a battle. Don't let your fondness for Carley get the better of you. It's a cooking show, not a dating show. Concentrate on your cooking. Hey, she and Jason can still be friends. They can do whatever they want, after she wins. Okay, can we talk about something else 'cause this is not helping. Okay. Okay. What're you gonna make? I don't know. I need to talk to Carley. Maybe you should keep your distance. I wish it were that simple. This is harder than I thought it was going to be. Yeah. I really wanna win. That makes two of us. Actually, it makes six of us. Our sous chefs are pretty invested. What do you suppose they're doing in there? Are they kissing or competing? The Romeo and Juliet of the kitchen. It's a nice story, but look out for that ending. What do you think you're gonna make? I haven't decided yet. It seems that the choice is as important as the execution. How about you? Chicken Cordon Bleu. Hey. Trust your talent. Believe in yourself. Be bold. That's really kind of you to say that, especially under the circumstances. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. I hate to interrupt... I think we arrived in the nick of time. It's time to start cooking. Jason's gifted. I say that with envy and admiration. The thing is, I like the guy. I'm not knocking his achievement from diner to runner-up, but Carley is the better chef. I guess we'll find out soon enough. Look at these exquisite truffles Jason is using in his sauce. Truffles? Like any great chef, Jason knows the importance of the best ingredients. Alright, don't fail me now. I want to start with Arborio rice to make sure that it has enough time to absorb all the flavours and then move on to the truffle sauce we talked about. Am I talking too fast? I'm talking too fast, aren't I? Jason is making a truffle sauce for his dish. What? He told me he was making Chicken Cordon Bleu. Apparently, it wasn't true. Well, there must be some sort of mistake. Maybe he's trying to steal your ideas. I can't believe that he would do that, we're friends. Unless he's been playing you. No, Suzanne, you're wrong. You can't have two truffle dishes. At least let me see what I can find out. Jason is using truffles in his dish. What is he making? That's what we need to find out. Okay. So uh, how're you guys doing? Okay. What's Jason making here? Let's not confide in the opposition. Tina said Winston said Peter shouldn't tell her what Jason is making. I don't understand. I don't understand why he would change his dish. It's brave of you to make such a complex dish. My dad is gonna love it. It's a tribute to him and all he's given me. Keep your eye on the prize. Don't let anything throw you. Everything okay? I don't know. You tell me. Well, I wouldn't say I'm okay but I'm holding up. That's not what I meant. Okay, guys, we're about to resume shooting. You're wearing your game face. It's a very pretty face even if your intention is to beat me. You're really gonna try to flirt with me at a time like this? I'm just trying to lighten things up a bit. Why did you change your dish at the last minute? Is that what this is about? What're you making? Lobster ravioli in a truffle sauce. I'm making shrimp and truffle risotto. Woah, do you think I'm trying to copy your dish? I don't know. I thought you knew me better than that. Yeah, so did I. You're running out of time. I don't wanna drown the ravioli. You have to start plating your food. I need my crunchy scallion garnish. Forget it, you don't have time. Ten seconds. It has to be right. Got the scallion. Hurry up. Almost there. Five, four, three, two... One. Time's up. One of your lives is about to change forever. The judges will now deliberate. Pretty soon this will all be over. Are you talking about the competition, or you and me? You told me to trust myself. Um... you guys can take a break before we start shooting the final segment. Car... What's going on? You should go after her. Go, go! Find out what happens. Okay. Come on, let's go. I just wanna say... okay, I have no idea what to say. No, I can't do this right now. Okay, this needs to be between Carley and I. Come on. Beverly sent me, it wasn't my idea. Tell her you couldn't find us. Okay, cut it. I want you to know something. I changed my dish because you told me to believe in myself, and that meant my history. Truffles in a diner? Okay... you remember that story my dad told? He took me to the best restaurant in the city when I was 15 so I could appreciate good food. I made the dish he ordered that night as a tribute to him, and to the chef he could have been. My dish was a tribute to my dad. We used to make risotto together. That's why I picked it. So we're good? Because losing you would be harder than losing this contest. We're great. I am so sorry that I doubted you. Hey. They're ready to shoot the judges' verdict. Okay, this is it. The final showdown. You have both proven yourselves making it this far. Now we have to pick a winner. Your dishes had similar components but both were unique in their own way. In the end... I found Carley's risotto to be the superior dish. Both of you have surpassed my expectations, but Jason's ravioli, that extraordinary sauce, I had to give it my vote. Thank you, chef. Well, I hate when this happens. Now I have to break the tie. We need your decision, Nora. Look, you're both very talented and deserving of your own restaurant, but I keep going back and forth. Carley's risotto is just superb, but so is the ravioli. I'm having a really tough time making a choice. We make each other better chefs. Yes, we do. That's what's really important to me. Me too. Why can't we open a restaurant together? Wow. A tie has never happened before. I would be honoured to share a kitchen with you. Yeah? Yeah. I don't think we can allow it. That would break precedent. I'm on the fence. I'm backing this restaurant and I think it could work. So now we have a tie about whether or not to allow a tie. Yeah, we do. We're going to need a moment. Are you sure this is what you want? We're in this together. Yeah. Okay, this was a complicated decision way outside our usual scope, but in the end we all agree. For the first time in its history Kitchen Showdown has two winners. He gets the restaurant and the girl. That's as good as winning gets. So, what are you gonna call your restaurant? A packed house for opening night. I am not surprised. The viewers were crazy about Carley and Jason. I told you. I should be working for you. Hey. Hey. Quitting that job was the best thing that ever happened to me. We're so glad you're here. Are you nervous, excited? How do you feel? All of the above. How about you? Just grateful. Thank you. Let's see. Okay. Almost there. Hmm? Now, it's perfect. Wow, would you look at this kitchen! You got what you always wanted. And so much more. Fred, I hope you and Marie can join me at my table. Oh, it'd be our pleasure. Well, now I can't let you have all the fun, can I? Okay. Say, you're pretty good at this. You work in a diner for 35 years, you pick up a few tricks. Thank you both so much. This is the best night of my life. Are those tears of joy, or onions? Both. Carley and I want to thank you all for coming tonight. We hope you enjoy the food as much as we enjoyed making it. So many of you helped us get here. Our families, our friends. And of course, Kitchen Showdown. Most of all I want to thank you. My partner, my best friend, and my favourite chef. Every day with you is dessert. Alright, we have to get back to the kitchen. Enjoy. Congratulations, you guys. We have our own restaurant. And each other.
