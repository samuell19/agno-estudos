Good evening, my friends. I pray you are well. Tonight marks the dubious honor of our third anniversary. For three years, we have ducked, dodged and cheated the machinations of the Nazis' evil empire. And for three years now, I have had the privilege to be a voice in the dark. We, the foreigners and the Jew, the weak and the infirm, we are all being hunted, make no mistake about that. The places we once lived... the cities and towns we once called home... have turned against us. The buildings... gardens, and schools. All these familiar places are now dangerous and alien. This is hostile territory. But you are not alone in this battle. There are others out there who are kin to you, sharing in your burdens, delighting in your victories, keeping the flame of hope alight. Remember to trim your wicks, my friends, for the darkness will soon pass and it is our duty to keep the lamp burning. No, you are not alone, and all the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle. Stay safe, my friends... and God be with us all. Alexie Diuo! You're under arrest! This is my investigation, Hauptmann. I put a lot of work into it. And you failed to get results. This is my investigation now, Inspector. You will wait outside. He told me everything he knows about the voice... which is nothing. He's useless. Good evening, my friends. I pray you are well. Thank you, Inspector. Dirty collaborator! Our cause is the same today as it was in 1940: survival and resistance. Do you know who I am? The enemy believes us defeated, but they are wrong. In the face of impossible odds, we have borne the banner of human dignity high, and we will continue to do so. I am Hauptmann Klaus Jager of the Geheime Staats Polizei. And you... are a liar. Stay safe, my friends. And God be with us all. Our broadcaster's name is Jacques. Ha-ha, finally. Yanko got home an hour ago. Maybe 30 minutes. A Reichsmark. Very nice. -You didn't steal it, did you? -Who cares? I found it. -You're short. -What? -Your payment. It's short. -You mean my pay, which I earned? Call it what you like. It's short. We won't have enough to save to get out. That Reichsmark is worth at least three loaves of bread! Enough! -What's this all about? -She's withholding money from the box. -I am not. -You were late for work. Keep your voices down. What's all this about a Reichsmark? -I found one under a table. Well... if the coin goes towards the savings for the papers, then that more than makes up the difference, does it not? Good. All right, let's all get some sleep. We need it. Yanko, douse the candles. I'm sorry about the money. I... hate this attic. You, uh, wanna be on time. -Yes. Juliet...Wait. I need a new vacuum chip from the store. You know where to get it. Make sure you check the new one. The filament isn't broken. Uh, don't stay in the room too long. Remember to lock the door behind you and... Papa... I know what to do. I'll be all right. Be safe, yeah? Hello. I said hello, mademoiselle. My name is Alfred. What's yours? I'm sorry, Sir, but I-- I can't be late again. I thought you couldn't be late. No one's supposed to be here. Caught you. What is this? Hey! Hey! Cut her off. -Hey, stop! -Move out! Leutnante, may I help you? A young factory girl, no more than 18. Have you seen her? In my office? No. You can eat. Don't mind me. Excuse me, Leutnante, Generalfeldmarschall von Rundstedt is going to be here any minute. So, is there anything else? No. Apologies. Please. My name is Andre. What's yours? Camille. It's a pretty name. Why are you running, Camille? I should go. Wait... Thank you. This is only a storage room. We had no idea there was radio equipment in here. -If we had... -Where is the girl? Um, she hasn't shown up for work since. Is that so? Where does she live? I don't know. She-she said that she was staying with her aunt near, Parc Blandan. But the girls say that when she leaves, she always walks towards Rue Bancel. Thank you, Monsieur Manuel. Arrest him. He's either a fool or a traitor. Hauptmann... Hauptmann. Please you let me out-- Hauptmann, please let me out. Inspector. -Juliette! -What are you doing out here? I was watching but you never came back. What happened? I'm okay. You're gonna have to explain. Juliet... what happened? "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. You maketh me lie down in green pastures. You leadeth me in..." Bertrand, please stop. Stop what? He leadeth me... In the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... Bertrand, please? We're praying. Fine, I'll stop. Agnes, wake up. Come on. Let's get outta here. Come on, we're getting out. -Where are we going? -Anywhere but here. Come on. Bertrand, we can't. Please stop it. This is our home. Bertrand... Bertrand, stop it. You're not thinking clearly. You need to listen to your wife. No! What I need is to get out of this God-forsaken country! Because if we will stay here, we're all gonna die. Bertrand, we have a plan. Not this. This is our plan? These measly four francs, uh? Will it buy us our papers to get out of here? No. We need to stick to the plan. We're all in this together. -Are we? Are we really? -We're hiding, as surely as you are. No matter where we go, no matter what we say, or what we do, we can't hide. But you, if you just keep your mouth shut, you could walk free like a bird. If you don't like living here with us, then you can just leave and be rounded up with the rest of your people. Juliette. How dare you. -You go too far. Does she, Jacques? Because your people are not made to wear these. There are hundreds of Jacques in the city. How are we supposed to find the right one? Heil Hitler. Werner, have you triangulated the broadcast signal yet? I'm afraid not, Sir. The best we've been able to do is, is this area. The broadcast continues to be too short for us to triangulate more accurately than this. You have thousands of people living in this section of the city, thousands. Inspector, the signal has been measured, yes? It is strong, which means we are searching for a large antenna. It's really quite simple. -What? -It's Bomelburg. Yes, Sturmbannführer? Well, since I have taken command, we have had positive results. But, uh, the locals have yet to become accustomed to our methods. But I can assure you they will. Yes, Sturmbannführer, you have my word. Thank you. Is everything all right, Sir? Why do you follow the Führer? It's not a test. Answer the question. Well, Sir... When I hear him speak, I feel my heart swell with pride. I feel the need to act, to follow. -Yeah, to emulate, yeah? -Yeah. This man... has the same effect on our enemies. They resist all the more because they are inflamed by his words. Never underestimate that power. History has been changed more than once by the wrong sentence at the right time. Now, I want you to plot every large antenna in this city on this map by this afternoon. Inspector, I want you to call the mayor. And I want to interview with every man called Jacques in this city. We will not rest until this man has been captured. Do you understand? -Sir. -Get to work. The last of our wine. We both need to go before the Lord. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. JAnd lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Forgive our sins. Amen. Her fever is worse. Assuming you could get it, how much would something like aspirin be on the black market? A lot more than this. Here. Get everything you can. Medicine, blankets, something for soup. Anything warm. Please. We'll do what we can. Hello, my friends. I pray you are well. Often, we find ourselves struggling with feelings of helplessness. Caught in the jaws of dire need, we must rely on the help of others to survive. Will this food be enough for our family? How long must we endure? But even as I share in your pain, I pray you also share in my encouragement. There is hope, dear friends, and why not? We have a better chance of finding medicine if we split up. We don't have enough. Medicine is not easy to come by. We have to try. You go get medicine. I'll work on the food. Any bit of comfort offered, any word of encouragement given, any slim hope for tomorrow is a ray of light in the midst of darkness. We must all do whatever we can, no matter how small. As the light fades and comforts flee, we must reach out to those the Lord has brought into our lives and trust. Stay safe, my friends. And God be with us all. Yes, the estate is wonderful, Friedrich. I have not been back yet, no. I wanted to let you know that the funds will be managed, the painting as well. I'll have that to Zurich at the end of next week. Good. Wonderful, Friedrich. Okay. Wonderful. Goodbye, Friedrich. Sir, sorry to bother. But this girl is insisting that she is your niece. Yes. Camille. Where are my manners? You must be chilled. Sit by the fire. My daughter is always cold, so we make sure the best chair is by the fire. It's been several weeks since I've seen you. Are you well? No. It's my friend. She's sick. She needs medicine. What is her ailment? Cough. Fever. She's getting worse every day. Wait here for a moment. My assistant is going to fetch the medicine. It may take all day, but you're welcome to stay here and have some tea with me. Camille, sit. Juliette. My name is Juliet. Wait here. I'll come back down for the other crate. Papa! What happened? Where were you? I was getting help. I found someone. He's going to help. Who are you? What do you want? My name is Andre. Andre Eerikäinen. -A German? -I'm Swiss. What do you want? I brought food and... medicine. Juliet, who is this man? Open the door! Put that down. What are you doing? Out. Go, go. Out, out! Papa! Come here, come here. Agnes. -We go together, we go together. -Just go. -No, no. You're coming with us. -Yeah. Yes, you are. You have to help us. No, I don't. Please. We need you. Thank you for your efforts, gentlemen. And here is the stipend for completing the work on such short notice. Juliette. Medicine, Sir. Proper introduction, I'm Andre, as you know. This is my retainer, Jorn. Uh... this is Yanko, Agnes, Bertrand... And this is my daughter, Juliet. My name is Jacques. I think I can speak for all of us when I say, thank you. You've taken an extraordinary risk bringing us to your... magnificent home. Well... um... we'll stay here tonight. And tomorrow, we will decide what to do with you. For now... perhaps some baths. It's a tradition, whenever my family and I first come to the country. Our meal is cheese, wine, and bread. Although they're not here, I would like to continue that tradition. Please... Bless us, Heavenly Father. We thank you for the safety of this sanctuary, the love of this family, and the courage of our new host. Bless us and keep us as we partake these gifts. Please... join us. This is good wine. We have detained a number of families from the raid. They are being questioned now. This won't stop you... will it, Jacques? Feels good. The sun, in my face. Thank you for the... the loan of the clothes. They're a little big. Agnes is looking well. Yes. Thanks to the medicine. Why do you radio? Are you part of the Maquis? No, I-- I just broadcast from time to time. Who listens? Someone, anyone. Resistance maybe. All I know is there are others like us who need to know that they're not alone, who need to hold on to hope. It's easy to get lost alone in the dark. Bertrand thinks I'm wasting my time. No one is listening. Perhaps Bertrand needs your message most. Don't judge him too harshly. His animosity is his armor against a world that hates him. For him and Agnes, it's... never been a question of, if they'll get caught, only when. So, uh... what will you do with us? There's a freighter to Spain. The papers will take some time. Thank you... for your loving kindness. So... have you made a decision? -Yes. I'm concerned about raising suspicions. There are so many mouths to feed. I'll be purchasing triple my usual at the market. Well, you know, Jorn? You're not the best cook. If you noticed, well, it's very dusty everywhere; the garden is swallowed by weeds right now. Sir. The house does seem a bit understaffed. Oh... that's very nice. -You look amazing. -Yeah, you like it? The tanker will stop two kilometers offshore. When it arrives, you'll have to row out to it. What is the name of Bertrand and Agnes' daughter? Ruth. She played cello alongside Agnes in the National Symphony. Where is she now? They purchased her passage to America. -It must have been very difficult. -They spent every penny they had. Oh, Papa. Look, isn't it just lovely? Yes. Very. And all these. You're, uh... too generous, Andre. It's very nice. Any word on the travel arrangement? Not yet. You like them? Well, I... I must be getting back. Juliet... Agnes needs you in the kitchen when you're done here. He just isn't the same without his radio. He does seem a bit lost. A pastor without his pulpit. The sooner we leave, and he can broadcast again, the better. Do you want to leave? Well, that was Mignonette's favorite. ...fraternity, stay safe my friends. You are not alone. And all the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle. Stay safe, my friends. That is enough of that, Werner. Enough of that. Let's... let's listen to a little music. Shall we? Do you enjoy Wagner, Inspector? I enjoy music. I... love Wagner. I fought in the Great War; you know? A leutnante. At the Battle of Verdun... we were meant to break the French in a massive assault. My father died in Verdun. And our kommandant was playing this very song for us... before we went over the edge of the trench. He spoke to us of the glory of Germany... of the insignificance of our lives in comparison with that of the Fatherland. I was filled with passion. I... I understood my purpose I charged forth. But my comrades... they didn't seem to have the same resolve. They only cared about themselves. I broke through the line... alone. I was captured. I was tortured. I was ridiculed by inferior men. Had my brothers not been so weak, had they charged alongside me... we would not have lost the battle. We would not have lost the war. We have the broadcaster's radio. There is no way we can track him now. You French. Always capitulating. Never underestimate my resolve, Inspector. That should do it for the antenna. This model has a range of over 50 kilometers. Does it really now? That's impressive. Thank you, Jorn. -Thank him. Yes, thank you. I was able to acquire a portable model. We'll put it in the boat. Perhaps you can use that in Spain to broadcast? Not sure I want to know where you got that from. Let's see if we can get this thing working. How did you learn this? My father ran a radio repair shop before the Reich confiscated it. Tell me something, Andre. Why are you doing all this? Food, clothing, shelter, medicine, safe passage to Spain? Now all this. Not easy to come by, and... certainly puts you at a higher risk. So, I have to ask... why? Because Juliet asked. Andre... why do you never speak of your family? Because they haven't spoken to me in seven years. I see. Back in 1938, I was a pastor of a small congregation in Alsace-Lorraine. To my eternal shame, as the Nazis rose to power... I chose not to speak out against the Reichskirche even though I knew it to be evil and heretical. My wife Camille, though... beautiful and full of conviction, refused to stay silent. While she spoke the truth, I tried to quiet her. She wanted justice. I just wanted things to stay the same. Then one Sunday morning da mob entered the church and, uh... they, uh, they took her away. I was beaten, stripped of my parish, and threatened with death, and that's how I was... how I was left with this little memento. You need to broadcast. Please be brave. Yes. Lord, guide me with your voice. Show me the path to righteousness and I will follow. Amen. Forgive me for my absence, dear friends. I am well. I have much I wish to share with you tonight but I'm afraid I must be brief. Though our enemy hopes that the weight of suffering will crush us, it has instead brought us closer together. Our enemy hopes suffering will beat us, but it will not. We can and will overcome. ...friends... Equality, fraternity. Stay safe, my friends. God be with us all. The signal's coming from outside the city. We have a direction. Good, good. Let's have a car outfitted for fieldwork. We will follow Jacques and catch him on the run. Pick a card. Any card? Insert that card anywhere into the deck. If you don't mind, what was the card? Um, uh, Jack of Hearts? Excellent choice. And fortunately for me, very easy to lure back. How did you do it? Tricky. Very tricky. Janko! What did I say about lazing about and playing cards? You're distracting the others from their work. Now get back to it, all of you! I'm so sorry, Monsieur. How may I help you? My name is Friedrich Dollmann. And you must be the lovely Mignonette I have heard so much about, huh. Your father tells me that you're studying at the Beau Soleil? Yeah. -I was. Uh, I'm--I'm visiting. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My wife attended the school. Yeah, small world. I heard they have the same head of a Headmistress there. What is her name? She, you know, has the face that disgusts jackboots off her soul. Sadly, she's still there, yeah. Madame... Madame Bluet Ferrigan. Of course. Mignonette says she does not look one day over a hundred. Andre. Generaloberst Dollmann. What a pleasant, pleasant surprise. And I'm so happy for you to meet my little flower. You have been naughty. Hiding out here away from me. Can you blame me? These views are lingering. I could tell this estate was the perfect gift for a man of your taste. Very generous. Always too generous. Let us go to my study and drink. Oh, this place is so beautiful. They look lovely. They have the cognac here. I left you four bottles of the '47. Ah, you remember the last time I was in this office, we shared a bottle of Champenois. Emmett, close the door. Sorry to have dropped in on you like this. But as I said, some of the others were getting worried. You have only picked up one deposit in a month. I-I understand. I'm sorry. I haven't been well. My doctor suggested the sea air, and it has helped, it has helped. So, I bring the deposits Monday morning and we will take care... No, no, no. Monday is too late. We are down here now. We shall come tomorrow night here for dinner. Say nine o'clock? Wonderful. And please tell your daughter that I look forward to seeing her tomorrow night. My wife would be eager to share her stories of her school days. Of course. Tomorrow night. Deposits? We have a dinner party tomorrow night. -Yeah? -This place, this place was a gift from the Nazis? -Does not matter. -It matters very much! -You lied? -I do not lie. What are you ferrying for those monsters? I'm their banker. And I deposit money for my clients, that's all. -You're a Nazi. -No! I deposit for them. What they do afterwards is none of my concern. It is your concern! Where do you think that money comes from, in this god-forsaken place? -I am neutral, I provide a service. -For the Nazis! I'm helping the Jews if you haven't noticed. And now you want us to help you in your filthy little business. -And you need to play your part. -Play our part? So that we can make them rich? -No, so you can live! If you run... we won't be able to get you out of the country. I'm sorry. Jacques, he's lying. He's not gonna do anything for us. -We--we could take the boat. -Papa, he'll hang if we go... I understand. I do. We all need to survive. And the freighter is the best chance we have of getting out of here. If we do this, then Juliet cannot be a part of it. There is no other way. Friedrich is expecting my daughter. She is not your daughter! For all intents and purposes, she is my daughter. And if we are not as believable as possible tomorrow, we will all be dead in the morning. I cannot allow it. This is not a conversation, Jacques. She will be at that table. It's too dangerous. There has to be another way. Papa? Juliet, I'm sorry. But I need you at that table tomorrow night. If the general thinks anything is amiss, we're all at great, great risk. She can hide and play sick in her room until your associates leave. Papa, I can do this. I know you can, my darling, but I don't want you to. But I want to. It's what will keep us safest. I trust you with everything, Papa. Trust me with this. I won't let you down. Then it's settled. Smoke? Oh, thank you. How about you? -I don't smoke. Been a while for me. Do you know the, um, biblical passage at the church at Laodicea? I do not judge. God punishes them for their neutrality, says that because they're neither hot nor cold... He will spit them out. We are not one-dimensional creations, we humans. We can either be lions... for the cause of good in some arenas, or lambs led to the slaughter in others. I've never been much of a lion... Jacques. Hewitt... I did not expect to see you. I'm sorry. I cannot stay. I'm just dropping off. Oh, it's a shame. Jorn will show you the study for your deposit, yeah? Right this way. Wilhelm. Good to see you. Trisha, ravishing as always. Sir, your briefcase. -Evelyn. -Andre. -How can we help you? -I'm looking for Andre Eerikäinen. Yeah, regarding what? I'm afraid it's Gestapo business, Generaloberst. Very well. Monsieur Eerikäinen is inside, I'm sure. -Come, I will introduce you to him. -Thank you. Werner, stay with the equipment. Friedrich, welcome. And your lovely wife. Pleasure to see you again. A friend, Friedrich? No, no. Hauptmann Jager is here on business. Good evening. I'm sorry to disturb you. But there've been numerous unauthorized broadcasts in the area, and I wish to find out where they originate from. And your search has brought you to Andre's home? Andre, where are you hiding the Jews? -In the attic. -See? I see you have guests. Surely you've driven a long way. Please... stay for dinner. Thank you. Beautiful! Classic. Montaigne, isn't it? Ready for demo, you know. And, um, how many generations would it take? It's three to four generations depending upon the purity of bloodlines. I'm sure you recognize Mr. Konrad Stubbendorf. He won double-gold in '36 with his horse Frey. What a pleasure. I've heard as much of Andre Eerikäinen in the city. Yeah. That is why I spend so much time on the coast. Mignonette, tell me more about Beau Soleil. Which dormitory are you in? Wonderful views of the western slopes. I know that house, yeah. Try to get her to focus on her school. Madames and Monsieurs, please be seated for dinner. I would like to begin this meal by thanking Andre for hosting us. In business and in private, you are truly an asset to the Third Reich. To our friend, Andre Eerikäinen! To Andre! The first course coming up. Yeah. Go, go feed the animals. So, Hauptmann, tell us about this signal you are searching for. Ah yes, it's this broadcaster, he's some sort of propaganda rebel who quotes God to incite rebellion. What do you know about him? My lips are sealed, Generaloberst. Thank you. You have a lovely house by the way. Business with the Reich must be quite profitable. Now, I'm tempted to encourage Friedrich to switch professions if it means luxuries such as this. Me? Banker? Too many Jews. Right, Andre? How many did you know, Monsieur Eerikäinen, before the war? You are a banker, after all. -Quite a few. -Must have been awful. Actually, they're quite good at what they do. Although I must confess, I'm happy not to have the competition. Dr. Astor was telling us about a fascinating idea he has. It's the elevation of inferior stock. -What did they say? -You don't want to know. Sounds complicated. Sounds like basic animal husbandry. It would be... if we were speaking of animals. What else is there? Plants? Humans. Allow me to explain. Jews, Slavs, gypsies, cripples, sexual degenerates, all are condemned to failure by their genetic destiny. But, while we may not be able to help these particular individuals themselves, we can offer help to their children. This is absurd. To the contrary, it is loving. Where are you goin'? Just as the Icelandic horse was bred with a Peruvian Paso to produce the modern German Aegidienberger, so might we breed these unfortunate humans into something more noble. More Aryan. What do you think, Mr. Eerikäinen? Um... I'm allergic to horses, I'm afraid. I'm a banker, I'm not a politician. Don't be so modest, my old friend. The contributions of many of us at this table, I'm not just talking about the pocketbook. I'm talking about the war effort. Even so, it's not just politics, it's science. Surely you have an opinion about science. I think it's bound to fail. The subjects would never agree to it. Even if the power of the State were used to force it? I think the power of the State is best served for other tasks... like winning the war. Who do you think will win the war, Monsieur Eerikäinen? We will. Of course, we will. And to the victor goes the spoils! -What are you doing? -I'm gonna kill them all. Good. -What are you doing? -Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Where are you going with that? Something I should have done a long time ago. We're all gonna die so they're gonna die. -Give me the gun. -With our cause had polluted genetics four or five generations back and it has all... -I'm gonna kill them all! -Stop it. Don't. Are you crazy? I'm gonna kill them all! Give it to me! You'll get us all killed. You please go back out there. You're raising suspicions. -You stop! -Shame! I find this all very fascinating. You're probably not even following the conversation. More wine! Surely there is a better solution for the next generation than killing. And that is exactly what I am proposing. I don't think you're gonna convince her about it, Doctor. I wonder, why such keen interest in a softer solution for these degenerates? What? Because it is the most loving thing we can do. We do not blame the dog for being a dog. No, we train it, we teach it, we elevate it. And I believe that if we breed these inferior unfortunates with the appropriate bloodlines, teach them the greatest scientific truths of our age, and convince them of their civic duty to Germany and the human race, they can be made into productive members of society. No, they can't. Their very existence is counterproductive. Can you blame a man for his genetics? But we imprison psychopaths. We hang pedophiles. Are not their crimes incited by their genetic flaws? Perhaps. Mister Eerikäinen, have you read Reichsführer Himmler's Der Untermensch? Subhuman? I have not. But you are aware that any means of integration have been deemed inadequate by our Fuhrer. Yes. The subhuman is the greatest enemy of mankind. It must be culled from the herd. -Isn't that scientific fact, yes? -Well, there is-- Would you breed... a German stallion or an Icelandic mare with a dwarf pony or a mule. The dwarf pony does not produce war horses. The subhuman must be eradicated. Hear, hear! In fact, my nephew will be leading a pilot program for the Einsatzgruppen to a small village nearby here called the Ramatuelle which is rumored to be housing resistance fighters and degenerates. It would be cleansed of both by sunrise. And by cleanse, do you mean murder? It's only murder if they're human, little girl. I'd like to change the subject. It's something that seems to upset my daughter. How very Swiss of you. You must be very careful which side you're on during this war. Anyway, our host was asking about the Summer School comedy. It's a lovely film. Has anyone else seen it? It's really quite funny. Do it. Go. You must warn the village. This is an urgent message for anyone listening in on this frequency. If you live in the town of Ramatuelle, you must evacuate immediately. The Germans are sending a death squad to clear your town of resistance fighters and Jews. You must evacuate immediately. Repeat, evacuate immediately. -Thank you again. -Congratulations, again. Doctor? You will come to my office tomorrow morning. I have some questions for you. Thank you for an entertaining supper. The Eintopf was a wonderful reminder of... Fatherland. I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, Hauptmann. Good luck with your investigation. Thank you. Thanks again for another wonderful night. Be safe, my friend. What did you just say? I repeat, anyone in the village of Ramatuelle, you must run. If you're near the village of Ramatuelle, the Germans are sending a death squad tonight to clear the village. Why is the signal so strong? We're right on top of it. What is it you just said? Stay safe. Stay safe, my friend. That's it. Curious expression. Do you hear it often? What? Every expression comes from somewhere. Yes, I suppose so. You have a diverse staff, Monsieur Eerikäinen. -I travel quite a bit. -You are fond of foreigners? You're being rude, Hauptmann. Come to the point. You're certain? You had better explain yourself, Hauptmann. Andre and I are going to have a little chat... Generaloberst. Why don't we all have a drink in my study? I have some very good cognac. Darling. I'll have a drink. Darling... it's time to go home. Just a few questions. After you. You must hide! Now! Now! If anyone is listening on this frequency, if you are living near the town of Ramatuelle, please warn the residents. They must evacuate immediately. Drink, Hauptmann? Yeah, banker. Where is he, Monsieur Eerikäinen? Where is who? I know that you handle finances for very powerful men and they value this service, therefore I value it too. Give me Jacques...and I will let you continue to serve the Reich. Cognac. As promised. Good vintage. This is an urgent message for the people of Ramatuelle. You must survive. Death squads are headed your way. Your enemies may believe you're subhuman, but I say flee these monsters. Juliette. Halt! Open it. Ah, welcome. Good to see you. Please, please come in. What have you done to him? No, no, no. Take your hands off her! Thank you, Werner. The door, please. You know, your father and I were talking about loyalty. Weren't we, Andre, huh? I need one answer to one question, and he will be free to go. Where is Jacques? Where is Jacques? No. Where is Jacques? You must evacuate... Where is Jacques? Where is Jacques? Where is Jacques? Well... I see where your loyalties lie. No! Do you have a cigarette? I'm going for a smoke. What do you want me to do with the house staff? Kill them, and bring the girl for questioning. You, up. Up. Oh, my god! -Papa! -Jacques! We have to stop the bleeding. And we have to get him out of here. Come on, help me. Get him. No, no, no. You have to leave. You have to go without me. -What do we do? -We can't leave him. That man is gonna be here any moment. -We have to go. -No, I can't. Bertrand, Agnes... look after her. Like she was our own. No, no, no! -Juliette. -I can't leave you. I can't! -Listen to me. -I can't leave you. Listen to me. This man, this Klaus, he will stop at nothing 'til he catches me. I have to protect you, do you understand? No! I won't. Listen, tonight, my little girl stared the enemy in the eye and did not back down. You have your mom's courage, and I couldn't be more proud of you than I am now. Go. -No. -Go. -No. Jorn... get them out of here. Hurry! The back door. Quickly. Ramatuelle... I pray you are safe. -If you have not left already, I say it again, you must evacuate. I'm af--I'm afraid this is t be my last broadcast. And I want to spend it remembering a complicated man. For a little while now, I have been living under the patronage of a man called Andre. Andre did not need to take me in nor provide for me in any way. There were no familial ties, no... debts of honor, no, no profits to be made. No reason to take me in... except the most important reason. That it was the right thing to do. And for that show of charity, he gave his life. No greater love has a man than this, the Christ said. In this moment, I understand those words as as I have never understood them before. I want to leave you now with a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay. It was... my wife's favorite poem. And has given me much encouragement... And now I want to pass that blessing on to you. "My candle burns at both ends; "It will not last the night; "But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends It gives a lovely light!" I now realize that in all this time, I've-- I have never told you my full name. My name is Jacques Christoffersen... and I look forward to meeting you all, my invisible brothers and sisters. Long live France. Long live liberty, equality, fraternity. Stay safe, my friends, and God be with us all. This is Hauptmann Klaus Jager, of the Geheime Staats Polizei. Jacques Christoffersen's voice has been silenced forever. Jacques? Jacques, my friend. I'm not sure if you can hear us anymore, but I want you to know you saved us. My name is Theo, and I'm from Ramatuelle. Papa, I can do this. I know what to do. I'll be all right. There are some others here with me that would like to express their gratitude. May their voices find you in heaven and God be with us all. Hans von Dohnanyi was my husband. He is survived by his wife, Christel, but Jacques gave me hope, and I will carry on. God be with us all. I trust you with everything, Papa. Trust me with this. I won't let you down. Henryk Dobrzanski. Died a soldier while resisting the Nazis. Survived by his son Ludwik. God be with us all. Tonight, my little girl stared the enemy in the eye and did not back down. Jacques' broadcasts are the reason I fight on.. God be with us all. Olivier Bernas. Survived by his wife and four children. God be with us all. I'm alone. Jacques gave me hope I will carry on. God be with us all. Jacques Christoffersen, our invisible voice of hope. He's survived by his listeners. He's survived by his family: Agnes... Bertrand... Yanko... Jorn... and by his daughter, Juliet. No! No! We will carry on. God be with us all. Henri Rousseau, fallen at Verdun. Survived by his son, Inspector Gerald Rousseau. God be with us all.
