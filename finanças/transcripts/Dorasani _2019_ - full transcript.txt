Shankar? You are being released tomorrow, right? Are you having trouble falling asleep? I've been here for so many years... Yes. Not years... You've been here for three decades. You were wrongly accused in those cases. I don't care about that. I care about the struggle... and the countless lives that were lost... in the name of revolution. You've become old... and weak. Where will you go? I'll go see Raju. Yes. Back then, we met when the situation was adverse. But our paths diverged. I don't know where he is now. Who's Raju? A Naxalite? No. A lover. JAYAGIRI VILLAGE Son. A man named Raju used to live in this village. -His house-- -Raju? He's my friend. I guess he must be of your age. -Anyone else by that name? -Tell me his phone number. I'll check. I don't know if Raju has a phone. You neither know his address nor his phone number. We can't help you. Raju? What does he do? His father used to paint houses. A painter? Do we have any painters around here? Not that I know of. By the way, who are you? My dear, my poetry is inspired by you. You are the waves of the ocean in my heart. You are the rainbow that stretches across the sky. You are the moonshine that melts the skies. You are the ecstasy I want forever. My dear, you are the pearl that dwells in the oyster of my heart. I know Raju. I know the Raju you are looking for. But who are you? I... I am his friend. His friend? How did you become friends? I met Raju... in the police station. -He told me about him. -What did he tell you? About his love... for the princess. Shank... Shankar? -Who are you? -I used to work for His Majesty. I am Siddha. Where is he now? Did he marry the princess? I came here as soon as I got out of jail. Where is Raju now? God, we're so late! Your train never arrives on time. Yeah, right! Raju, go slow, okay? I've rented this bicycle from Kareem. Don't tell him that the three of us rode on it. He'll charge us extra. That's right. -Damn it! -Oh, God! Hey, Buchi! Are you blind? Buchi? -Go. -Kareem is right there. Go on, keep it there. -Shit! -Run! What did you do this time? A FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL LAST FOREVER It's been ages since we came here! As kids, we used to play here every day! But ever since you've moved, we haven't climbed this fort. Yes, and he never skips school to see us. The last time we saw him was during his summer break. You don't know this, right? Do you remember the mailman's daughter Vasantha? -Yes. -Seenu is dating her. Vasantha was in school with us, right? Yeah. -Is he really dating her? -Yes. Look at him, he's blushing! That's His Majesty's car. I have to make arrangements for the festival. I completely forgot about it. You're studying too hard. It's been years since you moved. You look so thin. Is Grandma taking good care of you? Of course, not! He looks miserable. Nothing like that, Dad. She takes good care of me. You're here after so long. And you're leaving just in four days? Will you be able to stay for a month? We aren't allowed to take so many leaves, Mom. I can stay for fifteen days. My exams are just around the corner. That's what you say every time. Listen, there's a lady selling fish. You think you have the money to buy fish? I've borrowed two eggs and boiled them. Come on, son. Let's eat. Mom, I'm tired. When will she come out? Just a few more minutes. She'll be here. The princess has grown up, right? I saw her two years ago. -She looked like a kid then. -Yes. Even I had seen her a long time ago. -She's still a little girl. -Shut up. Do not address her by the word "girl." What if His Majesty finds out? You're talking about them as if they are your family. I know them because Dad and I visit them quite often. Do you think the princess eats cheap food like we do? She eats rice with chicken curry and yogurt. They change recipes for every meal. That's why she was glowing. No, that's not the case. Don't tell this to anybody. The princess hit puberty three years ago. What do you mean by "hitting puberty"? That means... Well, I don't know. But it's supposed to be something special for girls. And that's the case with the princess as well. Listen. You were recently circumcised, weren't you? Is that what hitting puberty means? Not at all! It's completely different! Really? Then what does it mean? You'll know when it happens to you. You guys never tell me anything! How am I supposed to just know it? Please tell me. What does hitting puberty mean? It means hitting puberty in the face. What does that mean? God shall grant you everything you want, Your Highness. All the riches, diamonds and pearls. Please give me something in the name of God. I'll bless you with all my heart. Seenu. I am here for Seenu. Hey! Why did you come here? Come with me. You shouldn't step into the fort. You had asked me to write something, right? Here. Give this to Vasantha. You have no idea how impactful Raju's poems are. "My dear... I am the dream..." Why did you do that? Look over there. That's Siddha. He works for His Majesty, just like my dad. If he finds out... No! One cannot afford to fall in love in this village. -Let's just go. -But why? Don't worry. I'll write another poem. Go give it to Vasantha. I'll lace it into a single braid, Padma. I've got a lot of work. -God, please. I'll look like an old woman. -That's Vasantha. Which one of the two? The younger one. The one who's lacing the braid. Her father is here. What do we do? -You see that telephone? -Yes. We'll pretend making a call. Then you can go give her this letter. Really? Do you even know how to make a call? And whom will you call? I have the number to the fort. Let's call them up. No way! -Please don't. -Okay, we won't. We'll put on an act. Let's go. And don't be scared. Hey, don't go looking like that. No, I don't need it. -Stand still. -Much better. Why are you unlacing the braid? Seenu. -Keep an eye on him. -Yeah! Hey, why is he pacing like that? Maybe his radio is not catching any frequency. My dear... I am the dream And you are its form Why is he reciting the poem he wrote for me? I am the cloud And you are the rain I am the poem And you are the melody I am the night And you... You are the moon My dear... I am the dream And you are its form I am the cloud And you are the rain I am the poem And you are the melody He wants money for his studies. But we can't arrange for it. We're broke. And no one will loan us money. We've got to do something. We'll have to ask His Majesty. Hey, Iloni! His Majesty wants to see you! Everyone comes to the office to get the paperwork done. And then there's His Majesty! He brought the office to his fort. But... the princess will have to go sign the documents for the registration... in Darmasagar tomorrow. How can the princess go without His Majesty? He's very busy. Darmasagar is a different territory. Otherwise, I'd have taken care of it. -Really? -Yes. Sir, His Majesty wanted to see us? When we threatened to confiscate your harvest, you said you'd pay your debts. It's almost harvest time. When will you pay up? Don't think you can escape it. Don't say such things, sir. Please try to understand. Fate has not been on our side. Give us some more time and we'll pay you back. You're so arrogant! Don't you dare talk to me like that. His Majesty is furious. He doesn't want you to work on the fields anymore. Go away! Get lost! Sir... please don't say that. We won't be able to survive without the land. That land is our only source of income. We'll do anything you ask us to, sir. Never try to argue with me again! You filthy lowlife! Try and learn something from your wife. Pay the debt as soon as you can! -Okay, sir. -Okay, sir. You should get an education. In fact, everyone in this village should get an education. But we did, didn't we? We were in school till the fifth grade, weren't we? Yeah, and we passed it as well. So did his Vasantha. It was so many years ago. Why are you talking about it again? Education can be pursued at any age. It will make your life better. Your parents can afford it because you are their only son. But our parents cannot. Who will work in the fields and take care of the cattle? Who will work in the fort? We want to get an education. But we don't have a choice. We need to work so that we can survive. In fact, I was at His Majesty's place last night, repairing the motor. You think we'll get better jobs if we study? You're a talented poet and your father has the guts to give you an education as well. My father also wanted me to study. But we are burdened with debts. I know what you and your family is going through. I am not asking you to quit your job. You can study and work at the same time. But don't do it just to get better jobs. Education is for enlightenment. Start by reading newspapers and books. Education will make you independent. You won't have to bow before anybody. You're right, but... Where will we get the books? Tell me. You can go to the library. But you won't, right? DHARMAVARAM LIBRARY DISTRICT OFFICE You don't need to get into the details. I'll take care of everything. Make sure... Everything seems okay. This land will be registered under your name. Please sign here. Where's that file I asked you to bring? We can't sell our land. How will we survive? Why are you selling the land if you're feeling so bad about it? Are you selling the land out of fear? I need to talk to my father. Can we do the registration after that? Oh, God! How did you fall, you fool? Hey, where were you looking? You could have damaged the car. Get lost! The princess is so pretty. May God bless her mother's soul. She looks exactly like her. Hey, what are you doing here? The sub-divisional officer was killed in a bomb blast. Now they're attacking the police as well. Let's go. Seenu, it's getting dark. Go bring some diesel for His Majesty's car. But why? The village is burning. He won't let the princess stay here. He's sending her to the city tomorrow. What is it? Why did you wake me up at this hour? Your father said that the princess is going to Hyderabad, right? Yes. So what? I... I am in love with her. And I think she loves me too. She also gave me an umbrella. You... YOU TOUCHED MY HEART I COME TO YOU, LEAVING EVERYTHING BEHIND. Hari, let's turn around. What happened? I'll tell you once we're back in the fort. Ameen is here, Your Majesty. Hello, Your Majesty. Yesterday, the sub-divisional officer was killed in a bomb blast. Today, they didn't let the princess go. I think the people are revolting. That's why the government has sent a new inspector to our station. He's a little dangerous. He will thoroughly investigate this matter. Your Majesty. We'll search all the villages. No matter where they're hiding, we'll find them and we'll kill them. We'll take care of it, Your Majesty. You don't need to worry... -or be afraid. -What? "Don't be afraid"? You're telling me not to be afraid? The police should be afraid, not me. Now get to work. Who is it? Dad, it's me, Prathap. Did they bring her back home? What's your decision? She'll be there after Dasehra. Till then you look after the registration of the lands in the city. -I'll send the papers with Siddha. -Okay, Dad. Do you want us to come there for Dasehra? Not now, Prathap. I'll call you when the situation calms down. -Is everything okay over there? -Yes, Dad. -What did he say? -She'll come here after Dasehra. Whenever something happens, he refuses to leave the fort. And she ends up suffering. By the way, somebody had called for you. Who? Somebody called... Saarayaa. Not "Saarayaa." It's Sarayya. What did he say? He said he wants to talk to Dad. Idiot! He's in love with a girl but he's afraid of marrying her. He wants me to help him. And will you? If they are in love, they can get married on their own, Barathi. -Shall we go to the fort? -No way! -I won't go there. -Come on, don't be scared. I have an idea. Chandri? Yes, Your Highness? Siddha is going to Hyderabad, right? Please give this to him so that he can buy something for himself. Okay, Your Highness. I wanted to give these to Prathap in person. -Please ask Siddha to take these. -Okay, Your Highness. "You touched my heart. I come to you, leaving everything behind." Rain, rain, Fill our stomachs with water Rain, rain, Fill our stomachs with water Fill our pots with water Fill our pots with water Rain, rain, Fill our stomachs with water Rain, rain, Fill our stomachs with water Fill our pots with water The raindrops sing a song The rainbow stretches across the sky The waves touch the shore The thunder roars loudly Kids jump like frogs in the rain Kids jump like frogs in the rain The raindrops sing a song The rainbow stretches across the sky The waves touch the shore The thunder roars loudly Kids jump like frogs in the rain Kids jump like frogs in the rain Is our love coming alive? Is our love coming alive? Is our love coming alive? Is our love coming alive? Climb the tallest tree... Climb the tallest tree For the most succulent fruit The cuckoo sings Sitting on the branch of that tree Fly away, birdie The sound of your wings Will shatter the walls of this fort Break all the shackles Break all the shackles And find your path Your smile is breathtaking And your hair luscious Your gait intoxicating While your heart is filled with kindness Let go of the fear Let go of the fear And leave everything behind It's pouring heavily, isn't it? Why are you singing the rain song? It's not even monsoon! Stop dancing in front of the fort! Go away! Planting that bomb was a grave mistake. You thought you could get away with it? We won't spare anybody. Run. Our next target is Shankar. Send the search team as soon as possible. Sir, there's a small problem. We still don't know who stopped the princess from leaving the village. -It wasn't Shankar's brigade? -No. Perhaps there's another brigade. Let's get serious about this. The movement has taken many brave souls. Leaving behind nothing but bullet-riddled bodies. There's no other way. Only sacrifices can change this system. But remember, a few clouds cannot discourage the sun. Go. Go and start questioning the lords in your villages. Mark an end to this slavery. -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! Dear? Devaki! Devaki... -What is the princess doing? -Your Highness? Dad? You've been sending them poems since you were a kid, right? They've finally recognized your talent. Look. They published your poem. Sir, she is a very clever girl. She has definitely taken after you! In fact, she is the cleverest girl in our district. Let's go. My dear... I am the dream And you are its form I am the cloud And you are the rain I am the night And you are the moon "You came to me, erasing all the borders. I found you, by bending the light. You got me excited about your poems. I am looking for you, with my heart wide open." Hey! How dare you! -Oh, God! -Your Majesty! -Please forgive him, Your Majesty. -I beg you! -Please forgive us. -He didn't know. -Forgive him, Your Majesty. -Please forgive him. All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling All the birds are singing All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling All the birds are singing The flowers in the garden are blooming The stars are twinkling brightly In the night sky Our youth is breaking all the shackles And running free The princess is falling in love Walking the path of passion with joy The princess is falling in love Walking the path of passion with joy Her heart is overflowing with desires She longs to see him every day He who comes running, Just to see her smile All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling... All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling... All the birds are singing... Do you like it? Then keep it. What will I do with this sari, Your Highness? Wear it on the day of Dasehra. I can't enter the fort wearing a new sari. What if someone finds out? The moon shines in the night sky And you glow in its light The moon shines in the night sky And you glow in its light The colors of the rainbow Seem dull without you The flowers lose their fragrance Without you I think about you all the time It's a love I can't explain All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling All the birds are singing The flowers in the garden are blooming The stars are twinkling brightly In the night sky Our youth is breaking all the shackles And running free -Here. -What happened, dear? Nothing, Dad. I'll eat later. Are you okay, dear? Yes, Dad. It's just a headache. It's pouring heavily. Let me call Chandri. You don't need to, Dad. Then cover yourself with a blanket when you sleep, okay? Whose book is this? Prathap sent it for me, Dad. Really? Okay. Good night, dear. Who's that guy? There's a painter named Iloni. He's his son. The dogs are barking. The police are on the lookout. I'll talk to His Majesty in the morning. You should leave. Be careful when you talk to him. I hope he listens to you. If not, we'll come back to talk to him. We can't fight His Majesty. Please don't do this. He never owned the lands. He took them forcibly. We've been serving them for generations. If no one fights back, we'll die of hunger. You're going to get us killed! If he finds out that you met the party members, he'll order the police to kill us! Please listen to me! Think about your family! That land belongs to my ancestors. Let go of it. You rascal! What are you saying? How dare you talk like that to him! Your ancestors lived on his land as well. -And now-- -Bramayya! Keep quiet. Maybe he's not being able to feed his family. It's my duty to help him. Where else will he go? Yaadhi, go harvest the field. It's your land. I just want you and your family to be happy. Go, live your life. Are you really letting go of the lands? Let go of them? Is that what I am supposed to do? I will ask Siddha to take care of it. Your Highness... your brother sent these new clothes and jewelry with Siddha. It's Dasehra. Make sure you wash your hair. You can wear these for the celebration. My dreams are filled with anxiety The excitement in my heart Knows no bounds My dreams are filled with anxiety I am thrilled My dreams are filled with anxiety The excitement in my heart Knows no bounds My dreams are filled with anxiety There are new desires in my heart I feel free Inside this cage of loneliness My imagination has taken a new flight Resting into the lap of anxiety... My life is in the search of Mystic pleasures My mind is filled with tempting thoughts They are teasing me to death I am overwhelmed With this warm feeling The blush on my cheeks Sends shivers down my spine My eyes convey what my heart cannot This feeling inside my little heart Makes me glow like the moon Bringing a bright smile on my face We've ordered everything for Dasehra. It will be a grand celebration this year. The princess wants to go to the garden for a while, Your Majesty. What? All the ladies will be there with holy flowerpots. All of them will be looking at the princess. Don't let her go. I don't know where my desires Are taking me But I am following them They are making my heart rejoice I'm in a state of bliss It's intoxicating Every inch of me is trembling It's making me float in ecstasy The rush is confusing Yet enchanting The blush on my cheeks Sends shivers down my spine My eyes convey what my heart cannot This feeling inside my little heart Makes me glow like the moon Bringing a bright smile on my face It feels so good. I have never been this happy. Because here, there are no walls restricting you. I had no idea that the fort looked this beautiful at night. I think it looks more beautiful today. Because you're here. What do you like about me? I... The fact that you wait by my window every night. I like that. What do you like about me? I... The fact that you come to the window to look at me. I like that. What's your name? And you... Well, you're the princess. No. I am Devaki. No. You are... my princess. My dad wants me to go to Hyderabad, to stay at my brother's place. I won't let you go. That day... I placed those rocks on the street and stopped you from leaving the village. I'll do that again. I have the red scarf you lost. The scarf... The one you lost in the garden. Yes. It's not an ordinary scarf. It belonged to my mother. It was her favorite scarf. I am sorry. I'll give it back to you. It's okay. You can keep it. Your Highness. Who's that? A police officer. I'll take your leave. Your Majesty! -Did you prepare the meat? -Yes, I did. Good. Pack some meat for Ameen along with two bottles of brandy. Okay. Your Majesty... It's Dasehra. The princess is very fond of the blue jays. Shall I take her to the garden? Okay. -But don't let her stay out late. -Okay. You went to see him without knowing the consequences. It was a grave mistake. I have seen you grow up. That's why I didn't inform your father. If he finds out that he touched you... he will kill him. I am waiting for your word. Tell me what to do. I touched him too, right? What you've done is enough. Let him go. What were you thinking when you went to the fort every night? Look at those wounds. They seem like a mob thrashed him. He never tells us anything. He should've never done this. He has put all of us in trouble. That's enough. I'll make sure he stays home. Stop yelling at him. This is what's spoiling him. Stop pampering him. If he stays here, he'll create more trouble. -Send him away tomorrow. -Stop it! Leave him alone, will you? WE DECLARE A 48-HOUR CURFEW IN THE MEMORY OF OUR MARTYRS Have no fear, comrades. This land has become more fertile with the blood of our martyrs. Comrade Yaadhi was murdered, but he fought till his last breath. And his murderers will stand accused in the court very soon. To protest the murders of our brothers... we're declaring a 48-hour curfew. -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! There won't be any buses now. You can leave after two days. -Long live... -Comrade Yaadhi. -Long live... -Comrade Aravanna. -Long live... -Comrade Tulasi Ram. -Long live... -Comrade Aravanna. -Long live... -Comrade Tulasi Ram. -Long live... -Comrade Somanna. Where did you buy this shirt? It looks good. His Majesty's son... Sometimes he sends clothes for me from the city. He also gives me money when he's here. Your father might be in the fort right now. You can go see him, right? Stop beating around the bush. Tell me what you want. Actually... The thing is... It won't be appropriate if I go, right? Can you please go to the fort... -and see how the princess is doing? -You fool! Be grateful that Siddha didn't kill you. But if he sees you again, he will. You said you were leaving, right? I thought you got over her. I wasn't going to leave forever. I know he thrashed me, but... Stupid! If he sees me with you, he'll kill me. I never want to see you again! I just saw that guy, Your Highness. You can't forget him, can you? I serve you. But I am also a woman, just like you. Let me tell you something. My mother was also a servant. She gave birth to me in this fort. She used to tell me... that the lords who rule, can even kill people for the sake of their honor. The lords may die, but the lordship doesn't. No woman in this fort can ever wish for something. Be it a servant... or a princess. Your mother would've talked some sense into you. But she died when you were just a kid. And now they'll kill that boy because you like him. He's also a servant's son. My dear, my poetry is inspired by you. You are the waves of the ocean in my heart. You are the rainbow that stretches across the sky. You are the moonshine that melts the skies. You are the ecstasy I want forever. We'll get caught if we post it, Raju. But I'm stamping it for you, without telling my father. Hi, Raju. That's a really big package. Whom are you sending it to? It's for my exams... It's an application. Very good. You should study if you want to stop serving the lords. Sir. Is His Majesty a bad man? It doesn't matter if he's good or bad. But he behaves exactly the way a lord should. And he's been like that for a very long time. So what if he is a servant's son? It's me... Devaki. Your Highness! I'm Ramaswamy's daughter Vasantha. How can I help you? Actually... Raju had once called me from your phone. Yes, I remember. Can you please ask him to call me? Sure. I'll tell him. He was here a few minutes ago. He has posted a letter to you. Really? Okay. Also... Don't tell anybody that I called, okay? Okay, Your Highness. -Hello, Ramaswamy! -Hello, sir. I have a letter for the princess. -For the princess? -Yes. We're all slaves to His Majesty. But you're one lucky man! He can neither help nor harm you. I wonder if there are more people like you. Hey, what are you doing? Why did you tear it? It was for the princess. I know, sir. -But there are obscene pictures in it. -What? The princess is growing up. It is not good for her. Are you feeling bad? I thought you might be feeling bad about what I said this morning. That's why I came looking for you. It scares me to even look at the fort. But now, you are in love with the princess. And she loves you too. I cannot believe this. You are a good man, Raju. I just don't want you to get hurt. I thought I could live without you. But I can't. I had a feeling you'll come see me today. Me too. I knew you'd be thinking about me. Which means... we are in love. Are you sure... I can drink this? When will you come again? Whenever you think of me. The rain will come tell me. Bye. What happened, Your Highness? I'll go to Hyderabad. Please don't hurt him. The fort where your laughter echoed Will now give shelter to silence The celebrations are lost The happiness is fading away Go on, Princess You've bore the burden of sorrow All your life No matter what you do You won't be able to change the truth Though the pain is unbearable Stay strong, Princess All the memories will soon fade away Cherish them for one last time It's a burden That is too hard to carry You can never break this cage The memories pierce your heart And the tears roll down your cheeks Pull yourself together, Princess This moment was inevitable It's not easy to walk away... From the love that blossomed here Where you took your first steps Nobody cares about your happiness But no matter how hard one tries to... They won't be able to forget you You fell in love, Princess Let that love be your sweetest memory Let that fire of your longing Be quenched by your tears No matter what you do You won't be able to change the truth Bring yourself to accept it Let your sorrows be your strength Go on, Princess And don't look back Just move forward, Princess Let your sorrows be your strength Keep moving forward, Princess Where were you? The police arrested your parents. Nobody knows why. Perhaps His Majesty can help them. Those morons, they took them illegally! What if they kill them? Go and ask His Majesty to help you. Why are you all staring at him? Can't you see that he's scared to go to the fort alone? Somebody go with him. Iloni's son is here, Your Majesty. Malli, keep him here. And if you let him go, I'll kill you. Yes, Your Majesty. -He's here. -Raju, he's here. Your Majesty... the police took Iloni and his wife. Please do something to get them out of jail. He's their only son. What's your name? What's your name? Posayya, Your Majesty. What about you? Komaram, Your Majesty. Nagayya, Your Majesty. Suri, Your Majesty. I am sure they took them for a reason. What did they do? Or did you do something? I don't he's guilty. He's an innocent boy. He moved away a long time ago. He's studying and stays at his grandma's place, Your Majesty. Really? He's a student. Good. But you'll know what happened only when you go to the police station, right? Do this. I'll write an application for you. Give it to Ameen. They have a protocol to follow. Let's see what they do. Let them go. POLICE STATION Don't worry. He'll be back. I wonder if my son has eaten anything. I don't know whose custody he is in. I wonder what they might be doing to my son. Tell me, are you nervous about going to America? I am going to America? But why? What? Did they not tell you? Your uncle is in America, right? Your dad told us that he's sending you there. Your brother's already making arrangements for that. -It's me, Devaki. -Your Highness! I am calling from Hyderabad. I need a favor. Please find out where Raju is. Oh, God! You're in Hyderabad? The police arrested Raju. They arrested him? -Dad. -I hope you had a safe journey. Dad... I was scared to tell this to you in person. I love him. And I left him... only for you. For your honor. So that you don't hurt him because of me. But you-- Come on. The villagers fear me. My daughter is a princess. And you... Your Majesty... I'll always treat your daughter... like a princess. You'd asked me about the charges that need to be filed on him. Accuse him of being a Naxalite. While the princess was going to the city... he was the one who stopped her from leaving. RAMAKANTH ALIAS RAJU ANYONE WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT HIM WILL BE REWARDED 10,000 RUPEES. We're Raju's friends. If he intended to join the Naxalites... he would have told us, right? Something's fishy. I'm scared. Raju will be safe, right? He'll be fine. Don't worry. He'll be back tomorrow. I AM THE EARTH, YOU'RE THE SKY I LONG FOR OUR UNION MY DAY IS DULL AND THE NIGHT IS GLOOMY WITHOUT YOU So the lord's daughter loves you, right? It's okay. You can tell me. She is his daughter. She has his blood running in her veins. Right? Then what makes you think that she loves you too? Our bond... It's not just an infatuation. It's love. What do you mean? Love means... It is love! She lives in the fort, yet, she had come to see me. Is that not love? No, it's just attraction. It's not love. We both know it for sure. It is love. But this love will never win. And if you fight for it... they will kill you. You've started a revolution, right? You think you'll win? They will kill you too. It's true. They will kill me. But in a revolution, even death is victory. Then... Our love is also a revolution. Dad... Devaki is missing. We looked everywhere for her. There is a police officer I know. I am thinking of filing a report. Hello, Dad? Can you hear me? Don't file a report. I'll call you back. "The police is going to take you both someplace. Don't know where." Does that mean... they are going to kill you? My death is inevitable. I don't fear it. It will help the revolution. But... I have planned something for you. -Where is Raju? -Who? Who is Raju? Pass me the bidi. Where is Raju? Where have you kept him? -There's no one here by that name. -I know he is here! -Who are you? -I am Devaki. -Where is he? Tell me. -Who is Raju? There is no Raju here. Don't you get it? Here... This is Raju. It's his photo. Tell me, where is he? He's this tall and... You can keep this. Please tell me, where is he? Where is Raju? The commissioner just took him away. Where... Where did he take him? Since you are in love with him, they... You are doing this for me, right? What if I die? I am not doing this for you. It's for the lordship. Go on. Why? Can't you kill us here? Why do you have to shoot us in the back? There's nothing else you can do... except kill innocent people. Please leave. Don't you think that ten men against two is a bit unfair? Fight me if you have the guts! Sir, it was the tire! Shankar... -Shankar, get up. -Let me be. -You should go... -Shankar! ...or else, both of us will die. Shankar, the police are coming. -Let me carry you. -No! They will kill you! Take the princess and run away! -Go! -Shankar, please-- I said go! But we are almost there. Don't you get it? The lord's heir is fighting against the lordship... for the first time in history. She's fighting for your love. And if your love wins, it will help this society. Now go! Go away! Go! -What are you doing? -You are losing blood. Leave! Sir, I found them! -Look! -That's Shankar! Your Majesty, the villagers... Your Majesty, please forgive us. They've put up posters stating that our son joined the Naxalites. He's an innocent boy. But everyone in the village believes it to be true. He's not been home for a really long time. Sir, we're scared to death. Sir... we are at your mercy. My son would never do something like that. Those are false allegations. I don't know how to make you understand. Please forgive us. Your Majesty, last night... Bhairi saw Raju and the princess eloping. He told the entire village about it. I knew something was going on between them. They talked over the phone a few times. Does your son think that he's good enough for the princess? How could he do this? How dare he! You son of a bitch! How could you do this to him? Come on, answer him! I knew something was wrong when he said he wanted to educate his son. He had planned this from the beginning! You're from a lower caste, you fool. This village has rules! You wanted to be kins with His Majesty? You trained him so well! You made him join the Naxals and entrap the princess? Bloody rascals! You thought he would do nothing about it? His Majesty doesn't fear the Naxalites. Your son will get killed. Did he think that His Majesty will give us our lands if he kidnaps the princess? God, stop talking nonsense! They are young. Maybe they do love each other. Why else would she run away with him? Hey, what are you saying, you witch? Don't you fear His Majesty? He's our god. He's everything we have. So what if they love each other? They don't have the right to elope! There's no way they can leave this village! We have to find them! Let's go. A new ray of hope... Is sprinkling a sweet fragrance Over our hearts A strange dizziness... Is leading us into paradise Every inch of our bodies is trembling It's making us fly high Our love is unfurling In this sweet high Dad... Tell me. I heard what happened. Please... stay strong. It seems like Dad is very upset. I think it would be better... if you go see him once. What you both did... it wasn't right. But it's already done. I will talk to the police. You don't need to worry. Did the bullet hit you? No. No, Your Highness. You don't need to address me that way. What are your plans for the future? I want to teach. -He's a great poet. -Good. I told you my brother loves me a lot. He makes sure he buys me this soft drink because he knows I love it. Don't get out of the car. The police might see you. I'll go talk to them about your case. At first, the police refused to listen to me. But it's all good now. Prathap... I thought I could live without you. But I can't. I had a feeling you'll come see me today. Me too. I knew you'd be thinking about me. Which means... we are in love. Raju won. But it was Raju alone who won. He won the moment the princess stepped out of the fort for the sake of his love. All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling All the birds are singing All the galaxies in the universe Are smiling All the birds are singing The flowers in the garden are blooming The stars are twinkling brightly In the night sky Our youth is breaking all the shackles And running free This is not just the story of Raju and Devaki who were killed in the name of honor. It's the story of many lovers, who are still being killed. This land is soaked with the blood of those who were in love. Witnessing this tragedy... might bring a change and that's the only hope with which... I penned the story of this film.
