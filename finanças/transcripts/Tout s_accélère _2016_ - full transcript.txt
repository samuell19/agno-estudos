For many years, I lived at high speed As a trader, I worked at a frantic pace, in modern finances exhilarating mixt of stress and speed. I was dedicated to it 24/24, and there was never enough time in one day. Suddenly, time stopped. Fast Forward One August morning, our family doctor told me my mother was terminally ill. She had two years to live. Everything collapsed. I'd never have time for her, if I stayed in finance. So I quit. I became a teacher. I discovered the leisurely pace of childhood, which mustn't be rushed. Yet I still feel pressed for time! The way the world is spinning makes me feel dizzy. Debt is mounting, resources are dwindling. People on the run, to keep up. And those who have given up. I spoke to my fifth-graders about it. Sit down. Their ideas fascinated me so much, I wanted to film them. I'm on a soccer team. I've noticed that every week, new shoes come out. New video games come out every month or so. Everything's going faster. It never stops. Going so fast, we miss out on a lot. But the up side is that you don't have to wait long for things you want. When something is new, everyone wants to go out and buy it. Even when they don't need it! It seems like we feel nothing, but deep inside, we do get the impression life is really flying by. We feel sort of... I don't know how to say it! We never take things easy. No one listens to us Because we're still kids But kids have stuff to say It won't waste your time Everything's speeding up In the whole universe We can't keep up Going fast, flashing past Everything's speeding up We can't keep up We're going to run out of air Consumption is speeding up. Mom, it makes me really dizzy We thought the world was better But it was only faster. We'll fall from on high. In your notebooks, please write down all the questions that come to mind about going faster. Questions that should be asked. To some experts who may answer them. What are your thoughts? Write them down. Then we'll go around the room and read them. Why did everything start speeding up in the 1700s and 1800s, instead of in the Middle Ages, or in ancient times? Will we slow down someday? - What's your opinion? - No. But we'll have to. Things will stop completely. Will our children live the way we do? How long before our ways of life change drastically? How long before we run out of resources? Why rush, when we have plenty of time? We're beyond "urgent." Or extra-urgent. We're at EEU - extra, extra-urgent. The fact that the time of the world is represented as being extremely fast creates the feeling in each of us that he isn't in pace with his times, that he is falling behind. Quite unconsciously, that generates a form of collective guilt. As if we were all behind, in terms of history. The world is constantly changing, changing fast. By definition, we're doomed to keep trying to catch up. Like a race car driver, steering the curves at top speed, on a circuitous track. He can't slow down to look at a map or to check the engine, because he doesn't have time. Our parents are always on the run, because their boss keeps telling them to go faster. They never slow down. At work, the boss is saying, "Faster, faster!" And we do as he says. But in the end, we never get ahead. We don't get ahead. Because we've been racing for so long we get nervous, from the tension, and we make mistakes. It's not always great, going that fast For instance, at your job, the boss wants you to work faster and faster. You get stressed out and need anti-depressants. It's complicated. Everyone is stressed out. We all have problems. But you have to tell yourself it's not that horrible. You have to reassure yourself. It's good, despite that. Technology, for instance. It's gotten much more efficient. Computers are a lot faster. Before isn't like now anymore. We used to take the time to make the objects we use. But now we want things ready-made, right away. We rush, we rush, we don't even realize that we don't make beautiful things Outside, maybe, but not inside. The most intimate and personal experience anyone has, our relation to time, has changed in the past 20 years. I remember feeling it physically. Physically, I felt this sort of obligation constantly to be in the now, and to be racing to do things. It didn't strike me the same way, before. Just look at the data streams. Sometimes, I just want to take my computer and drown it! I can't keep up! It really is due to the new technology. They started this headlong acceleration. An acceleration in our relation to time. Our relation to time has always been accelerating. Especially in the 20th century. This acceleration became breathtaking headlong starting in the 1990s, I'd say. It was directly linked to widespread computer use. Computerization changed certain important business methods. The main thing is the immediate availability of information, all over the world, covering the planet. Everyone is aware. It's transparent, in a flash. What does that lead to? Decentralization. But the decentralization occurs under globalized surveillance. So the system is peculiar. People are much freer, but they are forced to be much more transparent. There is freedom, but it has restrictions. Not that the world is Orwellian. The camera doesn't see everything you do. But it is a danger. As a result, that world is not an ideal one. From the standpoint of total fulfillment of the individual. I was hearing it during my studies in firms "We have to be hyper-reactive," I'd never heard that before. "My boss wants instant answers." People used to speak of stress, but now time is always present. Time is experienced as being the cause and source of something that generates a lot of anxiety. All the warning lights are red. More and more of us realize that we are wearing out human beings, along with planet Earth. There is crisis upon crisis, so many, the word is meaningless, and each crisis is worse than the last. A systemic crisis may result. Excess is what they all have in common. We don't know how to set limits. In a way, we're all burning out, from the pace, from the potential to do everything, to conquer everything. In the West, at least. We consume, and are consumed. It's our human side. It's the charming thing about us. If we'd set limits for ourselves, we wouldn't have discovered other continents, or other planets. But we are quickly reaching the brink psychologically and physically. Now, let's see if mathematics can help us understand this acceleration. What makes these graphs similar? The closer we get to now... At first, the lines are flat. But as we get closer to today, they rise sharply. - What do you see? - A wall. I see an elevator. An elevator! It takes us all the way up to the sky, then. Climate experts know there have always been hot and cold cycles. But in a century or two, we have begun to trigger the cycles. Changes that should occur gradually, over tens or hundreds of thousands of years, may occur in a spark of time, in a few decades. That's what shows us the scale has changed. Man has become his own geological force. At one point, humans realized how fossil fuels like coal and oil could be used, to increase muscular power exponentially. The Internet increased our intellectual power exponentially. That change in scale occurred in practically no time. Moreover, our attention span has changed. Extraordinary feats almost instantly cease to amaze us. They become the norm. I witnessed this acceleration. In other words, the decline in biodiversity, loss of habitat, shrinking ice caps... Climate change, etc. I saw it! In my brief lifetime. That's all wrong. On TV or the radio, have you heard people talking about growth? There are lots of kinds of growth. Getting taller, for instance. When prices get bigger. And growth means other things. There's economic growth. And more, too. The economic growth rate is an increase in percentage points. But the numbers are always growing. So the value of the growth rate increases. Let's say we have a growth rate of 10% Every year, we increase by 10%, compared to the year before. How many years will it take for us to double in size? It'll take seven years... for us to double, at a rate of 10%. If China's GDP continues to grow at an annual rate of 10%, how many times bigger will it be, in 2050, compared to 2008? Think! I subtracted 2008 from 2050, The difference is 42 years. 42 is a multiple of six. So you do two to the sixth power, and it equals 64. Do you think it'll be possible to multiply the wealth by 64 by the year 2050? - Is it possible? - Everything is possible, they say. I think, okay, maybe it'll be possible. But I think we should slow down before then. 64 countries the size of China are going to overload the planet. It's an awful lot. Economic growth is occurring in densely populated countries. Emerging economies are those that are just beginning to prosper. This gives rise to phenomena we have never witnessed. They disturb planetary balances, simply because the new demands are so massive. Look at the construction trades, for example. Or even the automotive industry. Half of the world's total demand comes from China. If it keeps doubling that fast, we won't have anything left, because we'll need too much! Everything will be dangerously high. And all will fall down, like in the song. I'm sorry to remind you, sirs But it's elementary. When we run out of resources, it will be the end... of the race. We consume more, we produce more, we live longer. So there are more of us. So you're at peak consumption, peak production, peak pollution, and peak population. It's an undesirable side effect of progress and success. At first glance, we seem to be better. We live longer, in many parts of the world, at least. We suffer less, we have more food, etc. So how to explain people that this is a sign of impending doom that it may topple down. We have a bottle, and early one morning, we put two little germs in it. Two tiny red dots, almost invisible. Two little dots. And these two germs reproduce fast. The population doubles every minute. We know that at noon, I'll write "12 PM" on the board... the bottle is full, to the brim. The question is, if the germs were able to think, when would they get worried, and realize they were running out of room Maybe right after they hit the halfway mark? If they're thinking straight, and know they double, when they've filled the bottle halfway, at 11:59 AM, they realize they're running out of room. Here it is, 11:57 AM. There is absolutely no sign that space is running out. But how many minutes until noon, when the bottle is full, and there's no more room'? - Bouna? - Three minutes. Only three minutes. Three minutes left to live, but they don't realize it. They look around and say, "There's plenty of room for me!" But they're mistaken! That's the problem with doubling every time. We reach the limit fast! That's the sharp rise on the graph. But there's big news. One germ, at 11:59 and 59 seconds, as Anaïs said, returns from an expedition. It had gone on a quest for other bottles, more space. And it has amazing news! It found three empty bottles! At noon, the germs can now go colonize new bottles. How long is the reprieve? Do we start with the full bottle, each time? Yes. One full bottle will double, in one minute. How long will they survive? They have until 12:02. Good, Johanna! The bottle is full at noon. At 12:01, the population doubles, and fills the first new bottle. And at 12:02, these two bottles fill the two empty bottles. Just two minutes! It's the same way on Earth! Even if we find other planets, we'll fill them up, too. It'll only take a few years. But what drives us to keep going fast The stronger our growth, the sharper our rise, and the sooner we peak. Why do you think every country in the world tries to increase its growth? Usually, when you have lots and lots of things, you feel more powerful. You're stronger. Countries do it to show off. "Look! China is the second-richest country in the world." It attracts attention and people. Everybody thinks it's magnificent to be so rich. All the countries should be happy with what they already have. But everyone always wants more. Since the others want more, we want more, too. The grass is always greener! But the end will be the end, for everyone. A record-breaking performance will be challenged by one that is even bigger and better. Ever greater excellence. Something that was fixed, at first, becomes something relative. It will always be trying to outdo its whatever it is. And to outdo the others. Eric Julien told me a story about hosting three shamans Buddhist monks visiting France. They had come to meet other spiritual and religious authorities. He met them at the airport, with his car. They had never traveled. And at one point, the highway went through a tunnel. They were amazed, because mountains are sacred, in their country. Many things are sacred. They asked Eric, "Why did your people dig a hole in the mountain?" Eric told them they'd dug a tunnel so they could go faster. So, one of the "mamous" asked him, "Where do you want to go, so fast?" "We want to go farther!" Then the shaman said something amazing, Julien was speechless. “How far do you want to go faster and farther? "How far do you think you can go, that fast?" This question is essential. We don't ask it, anymore. Do you know the old saying, "Better is the enemy of good." You try to do something very well, but if you try too hard, you're bound to screw it up. It's true. In 1987, in "Chaos Management," Tom Peters said "No, that's backwards. "Good is the enemy of better." The idea is not at all to do things well enough, and remain reasonable. The idea is that it's never good enough "Keep doing better!" Why does constant competition cause a problem? It leads to fights! Okay, go on... You may even fight with your friends and lose them, from competition. Also, if you're dead set on being the best, and you're not, you feel disappointed You may be so disappointed, you lose self-confidence, and stop working. Sometimes, to be the best in the class... Say somebody is a little behind the person who's best in the class, His parents may pick on him to make him work even harder. Even if the kid does get to be number one, he's unhappy. And the ones with poorer marks may feel rejected, because of that. There is an acceleration. An acceleration in pace. The stock exchange, for instance. And communication. Even the editing on the stories on TV news. Shots are shorter and shorter. So it feels as though reality itself is speeding up. But that is a confusion of reality and how it is represented. There are 2 billion people on Earth who have never seen a power outlet. They would not say the world is accelerating. What I see as symptomatic of post-modernity is that we are no longer in synchronous times. Some people live their lives at a feverish pace. Others are waiting, mired in boredom, barely moving ahead at all. But we don't see them. In a race, if you run fast, you might win. But if you go too fast, you run out of energy and slow down. Exactly right! Can you remember a fable about someone who went slower... "The Tortoise and the Hare"! Good morning, ma'am. We clocked you exceeding the speed limit on the sidewalk. You must go back and walk more slowly pulling this turtle. I'll pull the turtle, but I can't go back. I'm late. That's life in Paris! It's hard. But she did go back! Is this too fast? Is it right? Not so fast. - Why? - You exceeded the speed limit. Slow down! Nice and slow. They say you should stick to a steady pace, to maintain energy. But in this example, we can draw certain parallels. Energy stands for natural resources. And the runners are human beings - the whole world population. At some point, we'll stop. We'll become aware. We can't just keep increasing all the time. That's crazy. Loser or winner, is anyone getting ahead in this competition? How can we measure anything? With money? Can you think of a saying related to time and money? "Time is money"! If you believe that saying, every minute is money. So since your goal is to make as much money as possible, you have to work every single minute. More and more money. In a business, when the boss gives his employees a pep talk, he tells them, "Hurry up, or the company will lose money." Or he might say, "Hurry up. "And we'll make more money." You may not know this saying, but here it is: "Fill the hourglass with money, and you fill your life with problems." Actually, people think only of money, so they don't live their lives anymore. Why is it that people who have enormous amounts of money, amounts that would be plenty, for people like us, to live on, if we just spent moderately, not too much, not too little... Why do they want more, even though they have millions? They already have enough. What drives them? Why do they do it? If they always want more money, they're money addicts. They're addicted to money. Like drug addicts, who always want more drugs. It can kill them. Well, maybe not. But yes! It's as though money eats your brain, so that's all you think of. All you have in your head is "Money, money, money." Maybe they think being rich makes them superior. So they want to be richer, to feel more superior. The world of finance is closely paired with time. It imposes its laws on us. It leads you to believe that money is the dominant value in our societies. But in reality, many people contest that assertion. Money cannot claim to be a universal value. The debt itself is not the real question. It's financing the deficit with the debt. Financing the deficit with the debt is a denial of reality. The world of finance has made it easy for politicians to deny reality, instead of facing it That's my belief. It was convenient for politicians to postpone solving problems. And bankers collected profits on interest rates and bonds. So the world of politics colluded with the world of finance. Are we headed for a society that is split in two? Financially, economically, and socially? As a trader, I saw the power of money. Yet money is only a tool for parity. How did it become the instrument for our disparity? Disparity between Man and Nature, and disparity between man and man. Maybe there is a sort of nomadic, extremely rich oligarchy, traveling by helicopter, hopping from London to Paris, totally oblivious to material limitations. Meanwhile, the rest of the people, excluded from the oligarchy, are locked in daily drudgery. No matter what, emergencies end up settling themselves somehow. In one way or another, the world of tomorrow will be radically different from ours. Our only choice is whether we determine it, or it determines us. Growth supplies people with things that make them happy. There's a positive side to going faster - or we'd slow down. There are things people don't like to do. Machines do those tasks for them. Machines don't care what they do. You kids were born in the digital age. In the age of computers, cell phones, and all that. How has all of this changed the world and people's lives? Before, to send a message over a big distance, it took at least ten days. Now, it takes only one day, or maybe one minute! Look, there are keyboards. But where are the screens? Back then, it went on your TV screen. - Where's the mouse? - There were none! The theme of this room is energy. To keep a machine running, or to speed it up, you have to give it some fuel for energy. Look at this! See what they are? All these incredible machines, invented for speed. And the museum doesn't show home appliances like washing machines or dishwashers. The microwave. All of these time-saving machines. With all of these inventions that save people time, why do so many people say they don't have time? "I can't! No time!" They got used to saving time, more and more, with machines. So they filled up their spare time in other ways. So they feel like they don't have time. We invented time-keeping, but now we're ruled by the clock. We should be the ones to choose when we do this or that. Instead, the clock tells us. The more time goes on, the more we're slaves to the clock. We're always trying to fill up our spare time. We become obsessed with time. We become more like slaves, the longer time goes on. But if we try to control time - to ask for more, and stuff like that, we feel like masters, but we're still slaves. We're not the masters of time. Time is our master. Humanity made the transition from personal time, governed by day and night, and seasonal chores, to a form of time that is segmented the same way for everyone. That synchronism was the first phase of the industrial era, which led to where we are now. I think we like being rushed. Because our lack of spare time is a symptom of our freedom. We are well aware we could visit 1,000 museums and galleries a year, because we have the possibility to busy ourselves as we wish for the first time in history. We say we don't have enough time, because we are free. My great-grandmother spent all day every Thursday doing the laundry. She had absolutely no free time. But she never said she didn't have enough time. In other words, there was a sort of harmony, between subjective experience of time and "cosmic time," let's say - the time that was imposed on individuals by community life. Community life had meaning. Today, people are by themselves much more. Technology multiplies his possibilities tenfold. So he wants to saturate his schedule with activities, to crowd out an emptiness that would make him feel guilty. So we shouldn't complain. All this is the result of a desire that isn't necessarily expressed. But this desire drives us to saturate our schedules, because busy-mess gives us an ontology, some existential weight. When you're swamped with work, you exist. There's a sort of enjoyment in having the power to say you don't have time. Plus, it's a good excuse to shut out others. An excuse to say "No" to their requests. You can avoid taking care of them, because you're too busy. It's convenient! For everyone. Doubtless, they'll build us an even faster high-speed train. New tracks will need to be laid. When will it end'? We almost demolished a remarkable landscape in Provence, so that the high-speed train would reach Nice 10 minutes earlier. That, to me, is a sign of addiction. It's a question of limits. Of balance. People call me a Luddite, but at some point, you have to be satisfied. And we don't know how to do that. Is this speed something we hate, or something we love? Maybe it acts on us like a drug. Attracting us... and repelling us. How does acceleration feel physically? Why do so many drivers love speed? Going fast gives you a physical thrill. You feel good. Powerful. People just love the sensation they feel when they accelerate. Acceleration makes you feel powerful. The main thrill is being faster than the others. It's fun to go super fast. On the roller-coaster, for instance. What happens to your heart, on a roller-coaster? It beats very fast. It's weird, because you're scared, but you want another ride. Because it's something you really want. As though you want to be scared. That's weird. When you go really fast, what do you NOT think of? Time. Time, stress, all of that. All of that agitation. You don't think of danger. Even if you don't think of dying, and if you die, at least you had fun right before you died. You don't think of death, because it's so much fun. Even if you die, you die happy. When you exceed the limits, you're proud of yourself. That's why people are driven to go faster and faster. Acceleration is like gasoline. You need it. It's like natural resources. Too much speeding will lead to a breakdown, a total stop. That's a great analogy. You start with a full tank of gas. But if you drive fast, you run out fast. Everyone is so pessimistic! "If I drive at 200 mph, I'll use up gas, or I'll have an accident." But driving fast is really fun. So people should just enjoy it. Even if they waste gas, or risk dying. Life is something to be enjoyed. It's all very understandable. Man is aware that ultimately, we all die. That knowledge creates an anxiety we busily ignore, conceal, or disguise. We know we'll die, but we don't want to believe it. The best way to avoid the truth is to disguise it. Today, we are well supplied with drugs to do that. Speed is invigorating. People enjoy it. Speed is not constantly oppressive. It can be liberating. Urgency is an adrenaline rush. Actually, the pleasure the students describe so well, on the roller-coaster, is just... It makes your heart beat faster, It releases a flow of adrenaline. And that gives you a burst of physical power. You feel strong and fast. The other day, I had to cross town from the TV studio to my university lecture, fast. So I had my first motorcycle-taxi ride. I went from one place to the other in ten minutes. Zig-zagging on the beltway. What fun! When you're in love, you function differently from when you're not in love. Something comes over you, somehow. You positively glow with energy. It's the same! It's totally understandable. There's no reason to despair. But we will have to correct it. Civilization can be defined as the ability to correct such flaws. Because as we go along, we go astray. Are we still able to slow the machines, so that we can hear our heartbeats? Calmly. Inside. Today, when my kids ask me what the world will be like in 2050, how the energy issue will be settled, whether gasoline will be cheap, how airplanes will fly, I tell them, "I don't know, guys!" I don't know how to draw a picture of 2050, let alone 2100. It's as if the prediction machine had busted its springs. We have to be lenient. When people in the future look back on our times, the past 150 years, and the 20th century, mainly, it's clear we lost control. The level of panic today is so high that we are more apt to think about the end of the world than to change the world. As if our doom were more certain than the possibility of changing our way of life. Remember what Socrates said, at the market in Athens? "So many things I don't need!" We don't really need all of our possessions. When we watch TV, and a commercial comes on, we think, "Wow, that looks really cool!" But if we hadn't seen the commercial, we wouldn't even have known there was such a thing. We wouldn't want to have it. We keep complaining about how much we consume, or shop. But it's hypocritical! We shop too! We never stop! We're all talk and no action. Cutting down is not our top priority. Now, let's begin to think of solutions! Pay attention to what I write on the board. It's an illogical statement. But I want you to think about what it might mean, anyway. "Less... "is more." I know, usually less is the opposite of more. The idea is, if we try to do less, we'll end up with more. And if we try to do more, we'll end up with less. - We're less stressed out. - When? When we take more time. People have lost their ability to enjoy life, because work always stresses them out. Even when they rest, instead of clearing out their heads, they're thinking, "I'm wasting my time!" So they're still stressed out! Constant stress. It's like the story of the blacksmith. When he worked, he didn't earn much. But he was happy. He loved his work. He saw his son and wife. He stayed home with them. But when he worked in the factory, he never saw them. He'd come home and sleep. As soon as he woke up in the morning, he went to work. Day after day. Like Saphwen said, the blacksmith wasn't a rich man, like rich people today. But he was happy. He was able to feed his family, and he had his family's love. That's what made him happy. We are talking a lot about the problems caused by the fact that our whole society is always engaged in some sort of competition, always trying to do better than others and than oneself. As you've seen, we're reaching the limits. I want you kids to think, all of you, please think. If you had a message for the world, what advice would you give, so that you guys, the future generations, have a more manageable society to deal with? Instead of one that's headed for doom at top speed? If they got stuck with the pollution, they'd understand. It has to be something quite simple. I'd just tell them everybody's complaining, everybody says slow down, but nobody does it. There should be more action and less talk. Complaining is useless. We have to be careful not to lie to ourselves. If you can't manage to find time for what's essential, you have to wonder about your definition of the essential. We're racing against time, And that's on our mind. Yet we continue to hurry That reaction ls a mystery. How do you feel'? What has changed? How do you feel now, compared to in the city? What feels different, when you're in a natural setting? It's a lot more peaceful, without the noise from the cars and the Metro. And crowds of pedestrians. All that traffic is stressful. Here, it's peaceful. It's relaxing to hear the birds instead of kids shouting. It's not that great. There are tons of bugs, biting us. It's irritating! Does time feel different in a setting like this? Time seems to pass more slowly here, in the country. In the city, all that traffic makes you feel stressed out. Time seems to race by. There's more to look at here. There are trees and animals. There's more to learn than in a city. I owe my salvation to Nature. It is my greatest source of emotion, of balance, of awe. Being in Nature is what structured me as a human being. To love beauty... Free beauty. A gift... Let Time pass. All that stuff is meaningless. We invented it. We said, "There will be this thing called time, "and we'll think of it as something that passes." Like a whatchamacallit... From birth to death. That's a good way to think of Time. Heidegger said that Time is actually Death. In other words, "time" and "death" are just two words for the same thing. Heidegger also says death constantly corrodes our existence. It haunts us while we are alive. It erodes our vitality, and brings us closer to the final exit. But I disagree with Heidegger. I think Death is... an obligation. inescapable. But it doesn't influence the present. It's just a moment in the future. Death awaits us, somewhere. And I think death arouses more anxiety now, because we don't see it anymore. In the early 1900s, for instance, people were accustomed to seeing friends die. Schoolmates might die... People died throughout life. Not to mention soldiers dying. Death was always present, no matter how old a person was. Nowadays, people generally die of old age, and not before. And their dying is hidden. Death is absent. But that doesn't mean... This seeming eradication of death does not reassure us. The anxiety is spread out now, into a multitude of little daily fears. We're afraid of our food, of sex, of traveling. We see risks everywhere. And at the same time, we want our lives, our only lives, to be successful. So we evaluate our lives constantly. And constantly, because our models are so lofty, we think we're failing. So we want to do more. That's how, little by little, because we think we have one life to live, and death will put an end to everything. We constantly saturate our schedules to increase the quality of our self-assessment. That's exhausting! One of your students noticed that we've fragmented and intensified time so much that we miss out on life. We don't taste it, and enjoy it! I believe that a well-balanced life includes some boredom, some rest, some contemplation. Have you noticed that at times when you're frantic, focused on work, you don't listen to music. But have you ever realized how music catches up with you, and infuses you with life, when you're totally immersed in some absurd race? Can giving up be learnt? How can a whole society do it? Over geological time, our failure would be minor. Humanity wandered up this path in search of itself. The way other hominids have appeared, and disappeared. Some branches succeeded; others didn't. Homo sapiens failed, blinded by its own powers. I have every reason to despair, but I still have some faith. I've been lucky to see many different cultures, not just Westerners. And even in the West I've met extraordinary men and women. Humanity also means empathy, generosity... Strength. We kids, we say Wait! The planet Earth is just great! Love is the way to live Enjoy the love you have to give I do see an ideal life, but it may not be doable for everyone. Ideally, you would decide on the meaning of your life, and you would concentrate on the deeds dictated by your sense of purpose. Once you find life's meaning, everything makes sense. Time stops being an enemy. It is an ally, who helps build things. Time is a concept. It's not real. Man simply out time into pieces. He invented a way to speed things up. We're the ones who pass, not time. Our lifetime is sort of like time. Time isn't something real. Being a schoolteacher helped me endure my mother's illness. I was facing questions of time and death, and being in touch with young, growing lives gave me perspective. The mysteries of death are linked to the mysteries of life. They are two sides of the same coin. Death is necessary for rebirth. When I see all the threats looming on the world's horizon, thoughts of the kids brighten my skies. They are so full of life and the promise of the future. They are tomorrow. They are our hope. I hope I handed over the torch. Everything's speeding up. In the whole universe Since Man has been on Earth. Everything's speeding up, to our dismay We're going to suffocate someday!
