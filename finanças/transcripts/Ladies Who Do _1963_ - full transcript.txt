Dutch Subtitles by Pandorafilm - Heerlen You shouldn't smoke that much. You know it's bad. Mrs. Carpenter's husband also stopped. Then he was run over by a bus. Not by quitting smoking. -No, but it didn't help him either. Mrs Cragg... I am Ms Pinsent, your supervisor. Did you smoke? You know it is not allowed. I'll report it. Go ahead. Supervisor. What a poop madam. Spy is coming. Cigarettes out. Dag, Mrs Merryweather. Spy is coming. Cigarettes out. Jim. Where the hell is it? Hi, Sid. You got my message. -Yes, I got that. What else would I do here? -I was on the train all night. Haven't had breakfast yet. -What is it? McFarlane is not getting the money. He stops. As long as he doesn't tell you anything. -Never in his life, buddy. Sidney, we're going to take over Waldron's assets. With the two of you? - You are so fast. Shares fell 15 shillings. We offer Waldron a £ 1 cash. £ 1 cash? Have you gone mad? Where did that stupid blonde leave that Waldron folder? I knew it was wrong. Where do we get the money? Borrow it. Borrow at 40%? You're crazy. Of course I am. Pay for breakfast and I'll tell you. We're going to that brunette. They gain a pound if they stay off my clean floor. I heard voices. Is the floor not ready yet? Yes, but a herd of rhinos ran over it. If he doesn't want it, I know someone who likes it. Day, Mrs. C. -Day, Colonel. Bills, bills. Rain is on the way. -I hope so. I need a lot of grass. You with your horses. How did yesterday's run, who couldn't lose? The last of 15.- Better luck next time. How long does this kind of happiness last? In every sport: Horses, dogs. I get a tip to buy Bellings Machines . I buy the shares. They doubled the profit. -Nice is not it? No. They dropped half a pound. -Horses cannot be trusted. You weren't listening, were you? -Yes, but I don't get it. I have something for you. -What is it? Ha, a cigar. A very good one. Where did you take it? -I didn't take anything, as long as you know that. You didn't buy it. It has already been cut. -That's why I took him. I found it in the trash can. -Thank you very much. Very sweet. Have a nice smoke. I make a cup of nice tea. McFarlane's offer for Waldron is canceled. Don't panic, have an idea. Mrs. C. - I was shocked. Sorry, where did you find that cigar? -Why, isn't he good? Always the same. It's never okay. -That's fine. The best ever. Where did you find it? -Where I work in the morning. I saw it and thought, the colonel will like it. He didn't have to. -Who is he? Mr. Ryder, what I work for. -James Ryder? Yes, Jim Ryder. Can you call him Jim? No, I've never spoken to him. What's so special? He earns a fortune from real estate. It cannot be the same. He whined about a pound. And he had to borrow that too. - What could be going on in his mind? Not much, like he walked on my floor. I could have killed them both. The other one nearly died when he said he offered £ 1 for Waldron. Are you sure he said that? -Yes. He said: I am offering Waldron £ 1 cash. It made me silent for a moment. Because Waldron was my husband's middle name. Another for the madhouse. -Yes, I'll wait. Here's your tea, it's getting cold. This is my best tip ever. -You and your horses. This is not about horses. Yes, I'm still waiting. Someone would buy the Waldron firm. He changed his mind. The shares are falling. I'll buy some. If Ryder buys them, they go up again. And I sell at a profit. Easy. -Like that horse doesn't lose that. I'll make a fresh cup. -Yes I'm still here. Your cousin, the gallant colonel. -Yeah, more hot tips. What can I do for you, Cyril? - Waldron's course, please. I thought so. He wants to know a course. An hour ago, McFarlane withdrew his offer. They are no longer worth anything. -Fine. Buy for £ 5000 shares. Are you crazy? Where can you find £ 5000? - Put them on my account. Dear fool. Ultimately, you have to pay. And they are worth nothing. I'll give you collateral. -A couple of cufflinks and a watch? Sorry, but I'm not a pawnbroker. -I'm talking about this house. Did I hear that right? Your house as collateral for that Waldron? Send your lawyer with the deed. Bye. Okay, I bought Waldron. -I hope he wins. Then we divide that profit 50-50. - Very nice, but if it isn't ... No, I don't get a tip like that every day. Fair is fair. 50-50. Oh yes, I haven't been paid for the past 14 days. £ 2.10 please. I'm a little short on cash. Is it possible on Monday next week? It must be, huh? If we take over Waldron, this area will be ours. They all have to be demolished within 10 years. If this is ours, we will do it in 8-10 months, a year at the most. I dont like it. We have more than enough to do. If I did what you say we would still only have £ 18 in the bank. £ 18 is more than we currently have. Right now, sir. I'll see if he's there. I got that tip this morning. Excuse me. You will be asked on the phone. I did not. Only you and I knew about our takeover bid for Waldron. Did you talk? Someone bought shares for £ 5000. The price is already £ 1.50. I'll call Waldron before it rises further. Hello. Roderick, I've been calling you all morning. I thought they couldn't go any lower, but it happened. We already wanted to have your house measured, then that takeover rumor came. The price soared when that proved true. What is the rate now? -19.5. Your investment doubled. You made a nice £ 5000. -Sell everything. Lucky you. You got a hot tip. -From my cleaning lady. Hi, Colonel. -Day, Mrs. C. Please. Hello, you don't look so good. Sit down and I'll get some water. How did that happen? Remember those shares and the profits would split 50-50? Yes, I had already forgotten that. Don't worry about it. Drink up and you will be fit again. I'm going to make tea. When I bought them I didn't know what would happen. You haven't lost a lot of money on that piece of paper, have you? No, I didn't lose anything. I made a profit. You made a profit! I'm so happy. That's nice. You can use a few pounds. It's a lot more than a few pounds. Lake? -Yes, guess what. £ 50? -Lake. Not £ 100, right? -Lake. Lake? Surely not as much as £ 200? Yes, as much as £ 200. That is amazing. And you get half. Nonsense, a deal is a deal. - £ 200. I'm going to make tea. No, that's not right. I can sit too low. I'm not very good at numbers. It was your idea. I only need £ 50, not a cent more. Is that as much as you expected? -I wasn't expecting anything at all. I'm going to make the tea. Thank you for giving me that £ 50. You promised me half ... but many people would be silent. And I didn't know about it, did I? - Nonsense, I have to as an officer ... and gentleman. -You could say it was only 5. Then I would have been happy too. Your problem: You are too honest. I can dress up a bit now. Children no longer enjoy it. So good that you made that £ 200. I didn't make £ 200. You said emphatically ... - Forget that. I didn't make 200. I made 5000. Did you say: £ 5000? -Jawel, Mrs Cragg. It's safer if I give you your share right away. Right now, Colonel. Am I right? Are you saying you made £ 5,000 on that piece of paper I gave you? That and some expertise. - Then someone lost £ 5,000. No one lost £ 5000. We bought stocks and sold them at a profit. That's higher funding. -I think it's shady. That's what the stock exchange is for. So people like you and me ... show confidence and keep the wheels of the trade turning. I didn't see any wheels. Just a piece of paper. I had no faith in what it said. Neither did you until I gave it to you with that cigar in it. It's no good. A few pounds can. But £ 5000 is a different story. Nonsense, people do it every day. -Not me. It's no good. It's okay. Would I do something unfair? In the end I was honest, wasn't I? It's legal, so it's fair. Then I can also tell him. -Who? Mr. Ryder. It was his paper. And he gets this too. He had the confidence. - You're not giving that to Mr. Ryder, are you? Yes. My decision is made. There is no time like now. Within. Good morning, can I help you? -Day. I brush here every morning. Would I, Mr. ... - Mr. Ryder. If they have their way, they push us into ghettos like the Germans did. What did I say? A block of luxury flats is Big Business. Ryder Enterprise BV. That sounds like a cartel. What is a cartel? Well, that ... Those are the worst. Just wait and see. They grind us completely. Are we grinding? Who? -The capitalists. What do they say when our Billy runs out of space? Then what do they say? -Give them cake. I love cake. What can I do for you? -Well... Mr. Baker from Southern demolition company. Just give. With George. How are you friend? I'm fine. I have a job for you. Make a quote for demolishing some homes on Pitt Street. We just got those houses. - Are you in a hurry? Of course I'm in a hurry. -What about the sitting tenants? There are. I got it out before you can say "Bulldozer." I'll pick you up and we'll go there. Well, Mrs. Cragg ... - There were two things. This is not going to take up much of your valuable time. So you're the one going to demolish Pitt Street? Do you live there? -Yes and all my friends too. They asked you to persuade me not to demolish. Nobody asked me anything. I came by myself. The world is changing. Your resistance does not stop that. You have to accept that and if possible anticipate that. This is what the Ministry says about Pitt Street: Those houses will be demolished within 10 years. They no longer meet current standards. Those houses haven't changed since they were built. Neither do the people. They still have two arms and legs. And one head. Nothing has changed. Some live there all their lives. They grew up together. A lady is over 80. She has lived there for 60 years. Then it is time for her to change. Always the same with progress. There is always someone against it. If you and your friends are smart they will take the replacement houses. Replacement houses? What did you have in mind for me? Let's see. Here's a nice little house in Bur Borough. I don't want to live there dead yet. One of those new neighborhoods, huh? -I don't understand you. The Ministry goes to great lengths to build it. Get Bur Borough. You take it. -It has everything. Pubs. I have a pub. -Dance halls. Golf course. - I haven't done that in a long time. What does Pitt Street have that Bur Borough doesn't? My friends. You can't get us out. The law forbids that. Think about that. It's a slum. -Krottenwijk? Every judge approves my demolition. Because I offer replacement houses. Quite possible. And otherwise I will appeal. You cannot win this game. You win because we have no money. -Something. Money is not everything. - Is there anything else then? It would be good for you to crave something. Knowing what potatoes are. - Shall I tell you something? Do you know Orpington Street? Just behind Pitt Street. I was born at number 14. What did my mother earn as a girl? A lot less than you now. Nine pence an hour, she got. If she could get that. When the landlord kicked her out, there was no replacement house. She entered the workhouse. And now? I learned: Nobody gives you anything for nothing. Do you think? - Of course not, girl. You think I'm tough, don't you? Maybe. In business you have to be tough and do what you can. As long as it's legal. -As long as it's legal. Thank you sir. I'll remember that. - Is that letter for me? No, it is for me. So you didn't give him the check. -No, I want you ... it reinvests. Rather not. It is not the same then. If only I got such a tip every day. -Why couldn't that be? Do you know what he said to me? Go out and get it. In every possible way. He said. So he is to blame for what is going to happen now. What happened once can happen again. And again. Calm down ... -Do you know these people? Yes. Real estate magnates, investors. Money launderers. The most crafty people out there. Do you work for them? I know the ladies who do. Nobody tells me where to live. The only way we can stop that messing around ... is to fight them. -How do we get money? We are going to earn it. From the scraps of paper we find in the offices we clean. That is nothing. I sold some of that scrap paper once and got five cents. We are not going to sell that waste paper . We use it as a source of information. A lot of information can be obtained from old paper waste. We don't do anything dishonest. Everything must be legal. She means that we only use material that is openly there. Things thrown away and things that everyone sees. Don't open drawers or rummage in private letters. Understood? What is she talking about? -Take anything that seems interesting. And give it to the colonel. -I review and rate the content. After evaluating the content , we buy stocks and stuff. By which? -With what you use for that: Money. You make money with money. But what can we contribute? £ 40 at most. We'll start with the modest sum of £ 5000. Did you just say £ 5000? -We earned that this week. With one piece of paper, from one trash can. No, my husband ... We've always been fair. I can't do this. Why not? It's legal. -No. It's not bingo or pool. It's like the pole. Only we already know the results. Do you reassure that, Mrs ...? -Merryweather. The stock exchange is the altar of capitilism. The slave market of the workers. After the revolution, the stock markets are gone. Shut up about that damn revolution. Are you in or not? New? The revolution is not here yet. Good. But it is against my principle to make money from workers. I'm setting up the business. And remember: Keep everything secret. A careless word to your husband or a colleague ... Need I say more? - Is it really okay? No one can forbid you to join the Salvation Army. Another thing: You could get information from colleagues. Use it, but don't tell them. And no matter how well it goes, we continue to be a maid. I mean, I have to ... Any questions? It will certainly be a great business. But I am not participating. You are not participating? How so? -With you ... but not with the Salvation Army. There is my ex. Should I take that? - Never mind, I'll do it. No problem. Two are as easy as one. Good morning, Mrs. Parish. Everything safe. 32. 33, here it is. No, that seems foreign. Maybe it should be 35. Come in, ladies. You're late. How are we supposed to find that if you put Ladezulu on the door? Not that smart, is it? That's our name: Ladezudu. Ladies Who Do - Ladies Who Do. - Very funny, you know. Gosh, this costs a lot of money. Is one of the most beautiful places in the city. But not cheap. How much? -Rent, heating, elevator. Together ... Does it cost ... - Never mind, don't spoil my day. Welcome to the first meeting of Dames Die Doen BV. Your material is there too, I see. Information is the source of all luxury. That information is in those bags. We just need to sift and sort. Much will be rubble, but in between there is also beautiful GOLD. Does anyone still have questions? Shall we start our business then? Sudden fall in Lochlan shares Information leak? Transumers are being discontinued Predictably says Whitforth Excuse me, are you his maid? -What? Of course not. I am his wife. You said, speak to colleagues. I meant fellow workers. Not the wives of the national leaders. We're making good progress, ladies. We now have £ 26007.64 in cash. - On paper, yes. I have got you. -What are you doing? Almost wrong, but I have you. -I said, what are you doing? The CV is full of mosquitoes. -It's not on. That's it. It's cold outside. They come to the heat. There is none. They want to leave again and see the mirror as an exit. Guess what I found in my toilet. -A mosquito? That's right. A very large mosquito. Do you see? It is full of it. He patched it up again. 12 up. They have gone mad. How does he manage that? He knows nothing and knows no one. It does very well for such one. -He doubled his capital again. Why didn't I buy any of that? That's all. We are all affected by this, gentlemen. I get so tense, I don't even trust myself anymore. We need to find out who this Whitforth is. How does he get his information? -He knows everything I do. Gentlemen, wouldn't he be a spy? For whom? -A foreign power, which ... No, not that again. - You know anything better? Maybe he is a medium. They could be the future ... This is about shares. Let's take a look at those things. Take that Waldron case. I hadn't discussed it with anyone. No one. It was in my head. - Do you talk in your sleep? I am not married. Why this special meeting is? We got two pieces of information. In itself unimportant, but together. I'll explain. One thing we know is that the price of Pig Producers BV has fallen. Due to marketing problems. That's your slip of paper, Mrs. Higgins. I read from your magazine that Cash &amp; Carry bought Supers land ... within seven miles of Pig Producers. They want to open a bacon factory. This boosts the price of Pig Producers. Sounds logical. -What do you want to do? That we put everything on Pig Producers. -Everything? That's a big risk, isn't it? -Certainly. But such information never comes again. Putting money on pigs is like putting money on horses, isn't it? Not really. The pigs are already here. They are building the factory. The rate doubles. If that happens, we will have £ 120,000 in the cut. Shall we vote on it, ladies? Who's for it? Come on, I still have to iron. I do like Irish bacon. I still hang, whether that is for a pig or a sheep. What are we voting for? -Pigs. Unanimously adopted. If they sign right away, that's worth £ 100 each. I don't like it. They have rights. -Working, are you starting again? Look. If we don't get them out , we have to borrow money at 50%. I don't understand those people here. They live better in such a new neighborhood, which we recently saw in the North. I am amazed at you. Worker and errand boy for the boss. As thin as a bar. Have you eaten? I ask: When did you eat? I'm trying to say that. To be honest: I didn't eat. -But your bosses do, huh? See them there stuffing themselves with goose and caviar. Tell them ... that the gutters will be full of blood before they get us out of here. Come on, go tell them that. Come on, try one. You will like them very much. Who's there, honey? -We have to wait a little longer, right? Mrs Gubbins? You're just in time to see your husband get £ 100. Why that? You just have to agree to move within a month. Unfortunately, we cannot. -Shut up now. And let that mister finish. You draw. A good decision. Which you will not regret. that I know for sure. You know, we were moving next week anyway. Bye. Good afternoon madam. - We don't have to do anything today. Anyway, ma'am. Really. -If you wake my husband, he'll kill you. Not if he knows what I'm here for. To give you £ 100. Mrs. Merryweather ... - Then what? These houses are being demolished to make way for new construction. My company wants to start as soon as possible. Sign this statement that you will be leaving the house within a month. And you get £ 100. -My husband doesn't want to move. It's not what he wants, it's what he has to do. We have the law on our side. And the municipality. We hit the municipal man into the hospital. I want to be the best I can. It's not about what he wants. Your husband needs to reason. Otherwise ... -Other, what? You are lucky that I have a good time, so I explain something. We are not moving. For nobody. And if you bother me and my wife again ... I will crush you on that wall. Got it? -You explained it clearly. Next time I'll break your neck. What is this? -Tea, smart. What did you think? It's not what I think it is. It looks like hot dishwater. Mine tasted great. -Do you like tap water? Others want boiled water. -It's been cooked. You heard the kettle. What I heard doesn't make the taste. This is not cooked. Go cook your head. God forgive you, I can't. Never, even if I turn 100. But she has lived here for 60 years. She is over 80. Moving will kill her. She is very fragile. You don't want to think about those things, but how much longer does she have? What do you think? -No idea. Her mother was 104. 104? That is in 24 years. We begin this work immediately. Is for your own good. All these houses are being demolished. Bulldozers, dynamite, dust are coming. And bang everywhere. She loves to shoot. When the bombs fell, she was standing in front of the window. If people are unreasonable we let the judge decide. Dear virtue. I'm sure ... - Every judge says a modern ... flat, better than a dusty shack like this. I'm talking to her. Then she sees the wisdom of moving. We can try. How dare you imagine such a thing? Get out of my house and stay out. Parish. Just note that it is questionable. How are you doing? -With me? I just pulled through the garden and tipped over the fence. I have a signature. Was difficult but I convinced him. A? You must have them all to start. Do you know what she said? The gutters fill with blood before they leave here. She is right. -You have that old whine? There is a fortune in this case and about half is yours. No, Jimmy. It's all yours. Because I'm going to our partnership ... before you have to borrow money at 60% ... to be able to repay the loan by 50% . Old slapjanus. Tomorrow. Good morning. You wonder why I slept here? I was waiting for you. What's in that bottle? -Tea. Can you miss a cup? -Go ahead. I have a sandpaper throat. I was celebrating. From shack to villa in 15 years. That is the truth. I was born in a shack. My partner thinks I 'm going back there . Well, my ex-partner. He withdrew and took his capital with him. Will you give up Pitt Street now? -Never in my life. If you're stripped like that, how can you go on with that? Come here. Don't get upset by higher funding. It's very simple. The secret is to use other people's money. The contractor receives a share of the profit. So it works for free. I am selling the offices floor by floor. Prepaid. I already earn before the foundation. -Very smart, say. When everything is inside. -Thanks, I smoke my own. Come on, treat yourself. Enjoy it. I will be honest. I have to start on Pitt Street ... or sell everything at a great loss. I'm in it up to my neck. I have to save what I can and have to start on Pitt Street. You can help me, Mom. There is £ 500 for you. To do something? -Nothing. You said: Nothing is for nothing. - Almost nothing, then. Convince the tenants to sign the statement before Monday. £ 1000. I don't give more. You can really use it. You don't have a nail to scratch yourself. You don't get it, do you? We don't want to move. Someone starts that work. Even if I don't. Grab what you can. Treat yourself. Do I have to sell my friends? You don't buy friends with money. No, I keep what I have. Okay, then I'll do it the hard way. Spy is coming. Cigarettes out. Spy is coming. Cigarettes out? Another fool who calls wrong. You wanted to say what you intend to do. -For real? Never mind, Mom. You will notice that soon enough. Thanks for the tea. Hello, is that James Ryder? This is Mark Strang. My associates and I want to participate in the Pitt Street Project. But it must start immediately. Our capital should not be stuck. The contractor will start on the empty houses on Monday . Is that fast enough? I will be honest. We heard about your problems there. What old cakes are tricky. I'll take care of that. It'll be fine. I hope so, because in case of problems we are gone. There is the beep. I'll be there Monday morning. Did I hear voices? -I was singing. Then the supervisor came. - Interesting, but it won't help you. Even Mr. Strang leaves, someone else buys it. Let's do that. We buy it. -Why? What do we do with it? If Ryder is allowed to build offices, we can build two flats with shops. We buy the area. -We don't have the money. It will if that pig deal continues. -You don't know what you're saying. I know exactly. Suppose we buy that area. Then we don't have a cent to spare, do we? How can we build those flats? What do you know about higher funding? -It's a matter of math. The secret is to use other people's money. The contractor participates for a share of the profit. It then works for free. Then we rent out everything before even the foundation is laid. Now we just have to wait for the pigs to bring us the bacon. Moment. This is Colonel Whitforth. Hello Roderick. I heard you bought some of those pig stock. Smart... What news? - They're bankrupt. What happened? What is wrong? Swine fever. - Not our pigs? They haven't died, have they? -All 15,000. And where is our capital? -Totally gone. What did I say? I told you not to. Order! Order! Listen. The colonel put it to the vote and it was passed. We do n't have to blame him or each other . We haven't seen the money, have we? They were just numbers on paper. I do n't even think it's that important. We can't stop Ryder from demolishing Pitt Street now. Higher funding. It's a weird trade. 10 minutes ago we had 15,000 pigs. Now we can't even share a ham sandwich. Look at that mess. That's it then. We're going to have tea. I told you, the big bosses eventually beat you. Keep waiting. Have they started on my house yet? I'll tell them something. Colonel, what are you bringing here? -Important news. What happened? Are those pigs alive again? Even better. This just came in on the telex. Large amounts of valuable minerals have been found in Ireland. When burying the pigs. -Gives great speculation with ... Pig Producers shares. Will we get our capital back? -Absolutely. Even a lot more. Too late to save the street. Maybe not yet. Do you remember what Mr. Strang said? If problems arise, I will be gone. We're gonna get him into a lot of trouble, aren't we? You're going back to that device of yours ... and we stay here to take care of Mr. Ryder and Mr. Strang. Are we going with your car? -With yours. A second phone is being built in my Rolls . You had to sell it, didn't you? This cart has served me for 17 years. I don't waste money on a Rolls. Be careful with that running board. Beware. There comes that ball mince. Here it is. They hired you. We have to demolish these houses. We start with the empty one. We can't make a mistake, can we? 6, 8, 13, 15, 18 and 22. That's the one at the end. Forward turns on the compressor. Unload the tool. To start. I do not get it. Her heartbeat says she will live for another 20 years. I can't find anything at all. But old people often know best when it is their time. How bad. Very. She needs absolute rest. I give something so that she gets some sleep. In the meantime, give her everything she wants. In moderation, huh? A drop of gin or whiskey. Poor soul. I die. I know that I am dying. Don't forget: Absolute silence. Can you hear me? Would you like to tell us what you are doing? Do you know that... And do you know a sweet old lady is dying in that house ? Yes, die. You heard me right? If you start that machine before them ... When you start again, I'll let the police loose on you. I was just doing my job. How would you feel if your mother were dying there? Poor old lady. Lies there, wandering in her mind. Terrified. Thinking the bombings have started again. I do not know what to do. -I can only think of one thing. We have to call a meeting. Hey, buddies? Come with me. We are enough to make a decision. I don't need to see your cards. Let's start right away ... A little closer. There's a spy on the outside of our group. Here comes Ryder. And that must be Strang. They definitely have a tea break. What is happening here? Who is the foreman? I am the foreman. -Why don't your men work? Why aren't your men working? -Be quiet. I'll tell you what's wrong. There an old lady lies dying. And this one... gentlemen were so sweet to stop working. So sweet to hold up? And we had a meeting. This decision was passed unanimously. We recognize the influence of this work on that lady. We will stop for now. You mean Grandma Parish? She won't notice even if she gets under your bulldozer. Don't listen to him. This is that poor lady's daughter. How old is your mother, honey? -81. Did you hear that? 81. Isn't she entitled to some peace and quiet? She lies there so fragile and weak. Not when I spoke to her. -She deteriorated very quickly. If she's so sick, she should be in the hospital. I pay for an ambulance. -She can't be transported. This is a scam. She wants to stop the demolition. Have you seen the old taa ... lady? -No, not yourself. Of course not. Ask to see them. It costs your company a lot of money if I subpoena you. It doesn't hurt if I take a look. Good. Just have a look. Do not forget that she is unconscious. - Then she won't be bothered either. She is occasionally unconscious. Would you like to follow me? Do you know what to do, Mom? -I do know. I've seen more people die than the two of you together. I have to ask you to be very, very quiet. Just walk along. Here they come. Poor old soul. How long do you think? -She can hang around for days. There he is. He is. I threw it out once and I do it again. All get out of my house. You had to stay out of my house and I meant it. Get out and stay out. I am gone. -I would stay here. You're not gaining ... - You get what I mean? What do we do now? It's 11 o'clock. She does get tired or run out of ammunition. She now uses heavy artillery. -I don't go out a million years in it. What am I saying? Not in a trillion years. A bulldozer cannot get it underground yet. I talk to the men. What happened? -She read them the Levites. Everything was going well until she saw Ryder. Then she went crazy. I'm calling the police. A few officers will make sense of them. Once it is in motion, no one will stop it. Well, you get until 12 o'clock. War council in my house. They put us to the task. -Good. We passed this motion. We note that previous decisions are not taken into account . And we declare a status quo in this state. And that means? -That we go back to work. Awesome. Fantastic. -After the tea break. Tea break? They haven't done anything yet. They've been up and running since 8:00. -I pay extra if they continue to work. They can't do that. Then they are thrown out of the Bond. What's wrong now? -They have a tea break. That was when I came. -No. The men have been mad. But when they finish the tea, they never wanted them to ... Then they are not the only ones. They call the police. - Well, do they bring that in? We can not fight the police . Yes, if you have to. No more desperate talk, please. And if they use those machines? - We gotta stop that, huh? The French resistance was very good against the German army. There are more than four of them. - We will, too. Get this to all the people in the street ASAP , Eddie. You want to sue old Grandma Parish for violence? No, I have hard-working men here and problems are coming. What do they do against a bulldozer? -You don't know those old dragons. There are more problems coming and there is no police ... I send a message to some right people. Get this around on Orpington Street quickly . Come on, let's get to work. Start the compressor. Pick up all those stones so that the bulldozer can start. You're not working overtime, are you? They're not in a hurry, are they? -You know the British worker. Loses every trick except the last. -Is that right? Come on, let's go out. Behave normally and do nothing punishable. Or don't get caught in the act. Hello, Mrs. Pine. -Hey everyone. Just go. Rose. How nice to see you. I haven't seen your times. Yes, not since my surgery. It bothered me on a Wednesday, no I'm lying, it was a Tuesday. How sick I was. -But now you look perfect. I can't get over it yet. You go over there and stop that loading shovel. You're going to be tricky there. What are the police? Where can I find Mr Ryder? - You found it. What's the problem, sir? Saunders. Ask the women, ladies, to get away from that loading shovel. On Friday I had to go to hospital again. The ambulance arrived at 1:00 am. At 2:00 am I was ready for the table. When I saw that, I thought, girl ... - Ladies, will you please ... Then we did not receive milk or mail. - Just a little bit further, please. Get out of here. When I came to, the doctor said I was happily alive. How bad. -I lay on that ... You will be hurt if you stay here. - Did they find out what it was? How are you? You look bad. I just had a terrible operation. - Then you shouldn't be here. Come here, Bert. Lend a hand. Grab it. Here we go. Why isn't he getting help? If you're looking for me, I'll be in my car. They are bad enough. Don't you start again now. How are you? What a pity. Get help. Call headquarters and have them send another car. You haven't had surgery, have you? Thank God. If you don't start that thing right away and demolish something ... I go crazy. Someone drained my fuel. B-Blauw at the desk. Will you please continue on, ladies? Arrest them all anyway. -They don't stand still long enough ... to pick up for hindering. And in what? There are at least 50 of them. Did you send that message? Why no? I said so ... Where did you not send it? -The antenna is gone. I do not get it. But I do. There is a telephone booth there. Call them immediately. Tell me I want two arrest vehicles too. May I, ma'am? -Can I have a second? It's five to twelve, and if ... -Yes, yes. If nothing happens soon, you go back to Bradford. Come on, you ca n't stand here all day. I'm not bothering you, am I? May I emphasize how important it is that we begin this work? As soon as the driver is back and help ... That idiot is waiting at the phone booth. Ma'am, can I go through? There is a lady in it. - Get her out, man. Excuse me, ma'am ... I'm tired of you intruding here . This is a public cell. I know. -And I'm public and I use it. I have an important conversation. - Me too and I paid for it. And I make that. Sorry, Colonel. There's a cop in the cell and ... Saunders. Walking in the car ... say on the desk: If I don't have two cell cars within 15 minutes ... I let the air force come. I am a man of my word. I said until noon. So you still have three minutes to demolish something. Watch what you did. Killer. -It was just an old wreck. Was worth £ 50 at most. - Do you know what you're saying? I said, I'll pay for the damage. Pay? You'll hear from my lawyer as soon as I get to Bradford . I'm suing you for shock, damage, expense, loss ... and the car. Funny how your luck can change. -Indeed. To think there would be two offices there. There a fountain. And a golden statue. Painted, of course. And now? - Now you want to sell it. Moment. Who are you? My name is Colonel Whitforth. Do we discuss that at lunch? Come to my office tomorrow. 12:00 pm? What a pleasure. Come in and meet my Board of Directors. Workers. All workers. -Can you take it? So that's how you did it? Why didn't I come up with that myself? You bunch of ... - Well, Mr. Ryder. You achieve nothing with flattering. We invite you to join the Council. Shall we discuss everything over lunch in the Savoy? Something terrible has happened. - Come on, tell me. When I told my mother that she would be in a nice flat ... she said we wouldn't get her out in a million years. All thunders. - She can't make us do that. We offer her a replacement house. Well. We go for lunch first. And then I beat that old man ... Beware. -Shall we go? Shall we join the ladies? Dutch Subtitles by B. Cornelis - Pandorafilm - Heerlen
