My goal was actually 100 subscribers. And eight years later, we have over 16 million subscribers. I seriously wouldn't trade this for anything in the world. Today, I'm moving out of my house and I'm no longer living with my parents after 23 years. Okay, guys, the moving truck is right behind me. I think it's time. I'm really proud of you. - Thank you. - Thank you for making me a proud mama. I love you guys to death. All right, come on, guys. Saying bye to my mom and dad, not ever living with them again, that hits different for real. But it's time to go to the new house. - Oh. - The moving company's bringing all my stuff. And I'm... I'm really excited. This's going to be my first day at the new house. All right, guys, first night in the new house and you already know I have to vlog it for you all. I love you guys so much. And this house would not have been possible without you. You guys did this for me, and I can't be any more thankful. I just want to give you guys a quick little nighttime tour. You know, living alone might be weird and different at first. So, um, I'm gonna need all your guys' support and... That's so weird. I don't remember seeing that. Weird. Oh, Jesus. Front door open. I already have to get a locksmith out here. That's the responsibility of owning a new house. Are you... - That sucks. - Front door open. What the... What is it with all these balloons? I don't know. The first time was kind of bizarre. Like, my front door was open, I saw a balloon in the driveway. It's just not what I expected the first night to be, you know. It's just... It, it seems unusual. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just... Maybe I'm just tripping out, but I just... I just... I'm overthinking. Okay, so do you, like, want me to come over or something? I think it's because you're just getting used to the new place. Just make sure Mama Rug's cooking is ready for me when I get there. Okay. Sure. Yeah. Come over. Why not? That must be them. Did they at least bring food, though? I mean, I hope that's why they're here. - Front door open. - Hey! - Surprise. Hi. - Mom and Dad. - How are you? Miss you. - I'm good. - Noah! How you doing? - Hey! What's going on with that? - We got you a flag. - A flag. This is gonna look good on the top of the roof. - You're gonna put it up? - You're gonna go on the roof? - Yeah. - I don't know if that's a good idea. Brian. This is Bob the Builder. - Ron the Builder. - Yeah, that's true. No, that's true. My dad can do anything. - I miss you. My God. - All right, let's go. - Back together. - Dude, literally. We just need Brandon. I think we have a ladder in the backyard somewhere. All right, so I'm gonna go put it up. - I'll see you guys. - All right, Dad, good luck. - Be careful, please. - Noah, I got it. You want some coffee or anything? - Are you serious? - Yeah. Coffee? Why you have a bar like this? Oh! Whoa! Excuse me. Let's hit the bar. Wait, what happened when I moved out... Oh, so many things. We miss you and everything, but a lot of things are more quiet now. Now my friends are coming over. Nobody interrupt your videos, your crazy videos. Did I prevent you from that? - No, you didn't, but you know... - Okay, go have a seat. Mama doesn't drink, but because we're here and the vibe at the bar make you drink. It's nice, right? - Oh. Is that... Anthony's here. - Okay. Hey-yo, Brian, I'm outside, bro. Open the door. Yeah, coming, relax. - Oh, bro, please, please, please. - What? Look at this. - Ready? Give me a countdown. - Yeah. - Three, two... Okay. - Six. - Whoa! You did this? - No. - Mama Rug did. For Brian. - Ah. That's so cute. She calls him "baby boy." Look at this. Mashed potatoes, green beans. How did you find Marie again? Why are you asking? Someone recommend her to me and they said she's really good, and I can see she's doing a great job. Wait. But, like, you didn't even, like, tell me about her. - You didn't interview her or anything... - I never met her. She's just weird. She's not weird. She's heavenly. Okay, well, why are you still here? And why are you still filming? Because I want to hear more about Marie. Okay, well, you don't even have to film this because, like, we're just having a... Dad! - Wait! Dad! - Oh, my God! - Is that Dad? - Dad! Oh, my God! Papa Rug on the floor! No way! - Are you serious? - Oh, my God! - Oh, my... - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. Dad! No! That's not funny. That's not funny. That's why you guys came here? - Or did you actually want to see me? - Payback. - Payback-ack-ack-ack. - Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. That's my parents for you guys. What's going on, guys? Faze Rug here. Welcome back to my YouTube channel. - I'm here with my cousin. - ShermanTheVerman. And then we got Noah, the cameraman. - Yes, sir. - What up? Today we're gonna be having some fun. We're going to be trying to makethe world's biggest batch of popcorn without trying to burn down the house. All right, we're going to make the popcorn, but we need this to time how long we put it in the oven? - Is that how you make popcorn? - I don't know. If we can guess how long this hourglass is. - The closest... - You get 10K. No. The closest person to get it wins $10,000. - Oh! - No way! Three, two, five. Whoa! Anthony! What the... - All right. - Let's grab the timer. - Forty-five minutes. And what did you say? - An hour and a half. Hour and a half. Okay, so... Here we go. Don't see why it would be an hour. Wait. Should we just sit there? - It is a lot of sand. - Do we just watch? This is not an hour, just saying. This is not 45 minutes, so... - I honestly hate popcorn. - What? - Everyone likes popcorn. - It gets stuck in my teeth. Yeah, I know. We could... Obviously, we can see it. You didn't have to mention it. But it's gonna go on the video anyway. Whoa! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Get the fire extinguisher. - Check that fire alarm. - Dude, hold on. Put the camera down. Did the stove blow up? Oh, my... Dude, the popcorn's all black. Guys. Oh, my gosh. I was just trying to play some Call of Duty, you know, make a video for you guys and the power went out. Yep. I got to do some big boy stuff and find the power fuse. Okay, where is it? Dude, look at how creepy it is here. I think when I was buying this home, the guy said... I think the guy said that the power fuse is in the pantry, so... Ah, there we go. All right. Time to go play some Call of Dutyagain. Wait. Wait. Where's that coming from? Is that the laundry room? How late does Marie work? Oh, my God. Another balloon? What is it with this neighborhood? Tell me I'm not crazy. Do you guys see that? You guys remember seeing any balloons out there? Where, outside? Yeah, during the house warming or... - N-no. - I saw one tied to my chair. From a birthday party? Like, from one of your neighbors? No, it was tied to the chair. It didn't just float in. I saw one, like, outside the front door, around the pool. I keep hearing noises at night. It's... Bro, it's a new house. It's going to make noises. - I don't feel settled. - The wood is gonna creak. There's something off about it. I-I don't, I don't feel at home. Yeah, because you... you just moved in. It feels unsettling. Dude, trust me. - I have something to take your mind off of everything. - What is it? Let me just make some measurements real quick. - What? - Do you know how many, uh, inches wide this is? - No, I don't know how many inches wide... - Centimeters? - No. What do you want to do? - Millimeters? - Fluid ounces? - As long as it's not gonna get me in trouble, that's all I care about. Is gonna get me in trouble? No, it's not. I don't trust this kid. Yo, what is up, guys? Today we have one of the craziest videos yet. We have the Fire Breather 3000. AKA... AKA The FaZe Clan Rocket. Real quick before we do this. Where did you get this from again? - EBay. - What? It was crazy, dude. I met up with the guy, he had a ski mask on. Okay, I mean that... that's cool. But, guys, I just wanted to get, like, a little welcome to the neighbors. You know, like I'm new in this community. I want them to love me. So why not just launch a rocket? Are you ready to see the craziest explosion of all time? Oh-oh-oh. Did I... Oh. Wait, did I do it right or no? - Noah, Noah, it's on fire. - We can't be going anywhere near that. Wait, when is this thing blowing? - I'm gonna... - No, no, no, no, no, no. You go do it, bro. Quick, quick, quick, quick. - Oh, my God. Fine. - Come on. You'll be fine. - Just be careful. - Okay, okay. It's fine. Just grab, grab the rocket. Okay. I can't get that close, bro. Blow on it. Dude. Oh, no. - You good? - Where is it? Dude, that went so high up in the air. - You should have seen it. - What? It went up. Up. Can you hear? Hello? Up. Hey, guy in the ski mask, if you are out there, I'll be purchasing more from you. Five star. Are you good, though? - What? What? - Let's go, come on. Are you good? Are you good? Good? You all right? Yeah! Told you it was a bad idea. Dude, it's not a big deal, bro. You're fine. If I get in trouble, I'm telling you... I can't trust you... You should be more worried about the - charcoal and ash... - Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Shh. You hear that? They're coming here. No, they're not coming here. That's so far away. - Just go check it. Listen, they're... - All right. Bro, trust me there's not gonna be any problems. Brian. What? We found this a block away. What is that? OFFICER TRAVERS: Oh, it's a rocket. Isn't it? Yeah. And we actually have some reports of a flash of light and, uh, a loud explosion coming from your backyard. - Oh, that, that wasn't from my backyard. - Not yours? There's no way he's talking his way out of this one. I've never seen anything like that. I don't even know how a rocket would end up... - Oh, my God. - This logo here, - you don't know what that is? - You want to see it up close? That logo... - "Fa-a..." "Fa-Zi Clan?" - FaZe Clan. So you're saying you're not a part of this FaZe Clan? I don't know what they are, or what they do. W-w-wait. What are they doing? What are they doing? - Is this a new fad or something? - Yeah. You've got a little smudge on your face. This is... Wait, what? This is what I look like. Why are you guys making fun of me? So, uh, is everything good? Please don't let us have to come out here again. - All right? - It's not mine, but... - You can keep it. - You scared a lot of people tonight, kid. So just behave yourself and we won't have any problems. - Yeah. - Okay, do I keep this? What? I'm not even gonna answer that. - Be careful, huh? - I'll be careful. - Thank you, guys. Good seeing you. - Yes. - Dude, dude, dude... - What happened? We just dodged a bullet. They let us go. Oh, my God. - My God. - I told them, "What's a FaZe Clan?" I'm like, "Dude, I don't know." We're good, though. We're good. Come on. You want to show the RugRats what I taught you? You want to show them what I taught you? Okay, ready? Sit. Oh, try the backflip. Try the backflip. Oh, you... You think she's ready for that? Ready? Backflip. Flip. Sit. Tongue out. - Good girl. - Oh! Wow. Oh, hi. How are you? I'm Brian. I just moved into the neighborhood. Have a great night. Dude, I can't have the neighbors hate me again. What the heck is wrong with her? Bro, trust. This is gonna be the right thing to do. I'm not trying to go meet the neighbors. If they see a young kid living in a house like this, - they're gonna automatically... - You're not a young kid, you're old. - You're beautiful, you're handsome. - Thank you. They're gonna love you. They're gonna love me, too. I understand, but... Just come on. Noah, that'll be fun, right? Let's get some sunscreen. You're looking a little pale today. They obviously heard the rocket. And it's the least you could do. And whose fault was that? Was that my fault? - What do you mean was it your fault? - How old are you? Twenty-three. Can you make decisions for yourself? Yes, but you bought it from eBay from this sketchy guy that you met with him in a bush. If you introduce yourself to the neighbors, they're gonna see you as a nice, respectful young man. - Oh, you want to do it? - Yeah. Are you vlogging this? Okay. All right, let's do it. I want to vlog it, then. - There you go. - You force me to launch it. It exploded. The cops came. I'm not gonna buy more stuff from that guy. I am. And then, we're gonna do it in your backyard. Look at this house right here. Okay. They were nice. - That's pretty cool. - That's a good start. Yeah, they have a daughter, though. We have 50 other houses. I think we'll find someone for you. Your wife grabbed my ass, buddy. - Let's just go. - You're wife grabbed me. You're dumb. They slammed the door in our face and you decided to open it and do some dumb stuff... - His wife grabbed my ass. - I understand, but... Okay, well, this isn't going as planned, but we got to move on. - I want to try to at least get, like, three good neighbors. - Yeah. Let me do the talking this time. - You keep your mouth shut. - Okay. You're just here with me, okay? And keep your hands to yourself. How many kids do these people have, bro? There's a giant bat, giant hammer, freaking giant toothbrush, - a unicycle. - It's, uh, Albert Pujols. Albert Pujols does not live here. If anything goes wrong, I'm gonna blame it on you. That's fair. Oh, my God. I hate this guy. Okay, whatever. Okay. - Oh, God! - Better be water. - That better be water. - What the hell? Whoa. What the hell was that? Who does that? Bro, we gotta get one of those for the house. I love this house, bro. At least, are they going to answer the door or should we go? I think, you gotta, like, knock or something. No, no, I think that was just, uh... Such an idiot. There's something weird about them. Let's get the hell out of here. - I don't even... Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Bro... Dude, what are these people? I actually want to live in that house. - You want to live there? - I want to live in that house. That's the greatest house I have ever seen. Hello. Are you lost? Do you need help? Are you saying there's something wrong with sleeping on your lawn? - So this is your lawn? - Is there a point you're working towards? No, but is that your house then? I live everywhere, man. I live everywhere. Get back, back up, back up. - You guys, uh, in the comedy business... - We're filming ...I see. Funny men? Oh, we make YouTube videos. We kind of just document our lives. We get laughs. You guys get laughs? - Yeah, but who's "we"? - Should we go? - Who is the "we"? - This guy serious? - We got to go inside. - Yeah, we're gonna go. Our dog is in a car, right now. Welcome to the neighborhood. We're glad you're here. Oh! No way. - No! - What do you got there? What is that? Some, uh, Graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows. So, a s'more? Graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows... - So it's s'mores. - S'more. - Well, it's not a s'more yet. - Dude, yes! This was not expected from you, by the way. - S'mores? - Well, cheers. - No, you just... - Yes. Cheers. Bro, this guy needs to get off from our team. - Yeah, for real. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - You burn yours? - Mmm, kind of. Ow! 'Cause mine's charred. Oh, shit. Burnt myself. Hold on. It sounds like clown music. - Do you guys not hear that? - Bro, you're pretty baked. It sounds like a carnival's right next door. - You guys can't hear it? - Or a taco truck. It's not a taco truck at 12:30 in the morning. - Well, it's also probably not a clown, fool... - Oh. Damn it. I mean, it's not a taco truck. Whatever it is. You're fun. You're on a good one today. I'm telling you, it's coming from the weird house down the street. Dude, I'm toasting my arm more than the marshmallow. Yo, the FaZe guys pulled up to the crib. - We here at the Casa deFaZe Rug. - We here. The interior design in here is crazy. - Wow. - He's already going for it. You guys think Brian is going to last living here alone? - Not a chance. - Not without Papa Rug and Mama Rug. Already tried to move to LA like what... - Ten times, bro, seven times. - Seven. Never happened. I just don't think you're gonna be able to live here without your family. - Oh, wow. - This is the office. - This is the lab... - Okay. - ...where I keep all my camera equipment... - This is pretty sick. If the light bulb goes out, what's this kid gonna do? Yeah, no, not a chance. - What else we got? What's next? - All right. We are entering... - That is sick. - The Kobe? - Yes, dude. - Fire, bro. - Dude, insane. - That's gotta get you comfortable in your new home. - I'm twenty-three, so I got to live by myself. - Oh! Wow! - What do you think? - What? Let me show you guys the bathroom, though. This is pretty impressive. - Wow! Damn. - Yeah. Already boke the shower. Can't get it fixed. You know I'm learning. - Oh, my bad. - You got enough faucets. - That's not good. - Dude, it's all good. I mean, it's just smell ready for anything. Dude, that... I think that's like $10,000. -That's expensive -RUG: Yeah. Whoa! Whoa! Dude! Yo, stop. Dude, this house is like a fun house. Rug, you've got an entire Gucci store in here, bro. - Yeah, man. - You already know. He has literally everything. Dude, where is Adapt at? Don't tell me he's messing with something else. Oh, my God! - Dude, is he joking? - Is this kid serious? Oh! - Let's go. - There he is. Marie, what are you doing? The best part about the house, though. There's a lot of best parts, but I got security cameras in every single room. - Ooh. - You're ready to go. Yeah, bro Everything's secure. I dare someone to try to come here. Wait. Look at this, though. Are you ready? This is another best part of the house. - Wow. - I swear the best part... Listen, listen. Ready? Front door open. Oh! It's a vibe out here. Okay, this is pretty sick. If you make this first try, I'll give you a thousand bucks. I'm gonna give everyone a try. - Okay. - If our guys don't make it, then... So what... what hole are we going to? No chance. No chance. Little bit left to right, maybe like half a cup, you know. Gonna start putting gaming systems in here. - Y'all know how my dream car's a Rolls-Royce. - Yeah. Imagine a Rolls-Royce movie theater. I mean... - Can I turn this on... - Uh, no, no, no, no, no. - Don't... No... - Why not? - No way. - Rug? What? What? You're already watching your family, little kid videos and stuff. - That's crazy. - All right. Enough of the freaking videos. We don't have to keep watching it. But I have to show you guys, this is soundproof. The whole theater? Hello? Hello? - Okay. - No one could hear us out there. Pretty cool, right? Ready? Watch this. - Hello! Oh, my God! - Hi. Oh, hey, Marie. Hey, you're jumpy. - Who's Marie? - Wait, I didn't know you were coming today. - Not today. - Wait, Brian. - Who's Marie? - Your mom hired you a nanny? No, this isn't my nanny, it's my maid. Are you shooting something weird right now. No, he doesn't... He's busy. - He's busy. - Anthony. - Hi. - I mean I could probably show you around. - Oh, okay... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, SenorBrian, SenorNikan. - Hi, Noah. SenorNikan, actually. - I'm moving into the... - You're not even moving here. No, bro, chill. I got the whole family vibe, you know what I'm saying? - Like, you know, mom and dad. - Oh, are you family? No... Why don't we just, like, not clean and just go chill by the pool? Oh... Oh, can I? Can I? I mean... - You like the tenant? - Yes. I mean, you're like, part of the family now. - Like step... Step-sister. - I mean, uh... - I need to start. Can you show me... - Yeah, thank you, thank you. - Guys... - Yeah, we can show her. - Let's all jump in the pool. - I'll show her. - We can all show her. - Yo. Did Brian's mom just hire him a nanny? I guess. - But she's a hot nanny. - She's bad, bro. She's hot, though. The other day, me and Noah and Brian were making s'mores. And we heard, uh, like, music. And it was a taco truck and Brian thought... - It wasn't a taco truck. - Bro, it was deadass a taco truck. It was a circus music that we hear every night. It was a guy making adobada. - No... - Yeah. And probably carne asada. So seriously, put yourself in my shoes and, like, think about you just moved to this new house and you're starting to hear all that weird stuff and see all that weird stuff. And then no one believes you because they think you're a "prankster." I cannot believe how hot Marie was today. She's vibing with me like crazy. - What do you mean? - Yeah, I forgot to tell you, bro, she... The way she looks at me and stuff. I know you're not talking about Marie. You guys are children. - She could babysit you guys. - What? - I would love it if she was my babysitter. - No, same, that'd be sick. - I'm so sorry, Noah, but... - Let me see. You're gonna have to hit puberty before you can even think about dating a woman. She hates you, bro. - And you? - Stop. Puberty is not just this and your little bling on your teeth. That's a child. And, Noah, gain some weight. - A woman needs a man. - What is this? - I'm so sorry, you guys. - Okay. Brian, I love you so much. Thank you so much. Better luck next time, guys. That's kind of rude. Can you believe Adapt asked for Marie's number? No, seriously, though. What was he thinking? - Does he... Does he... - It's Adapt. The way she was looking at me, indescribable. Whoa. Dude, dude, dude, dude. - Isn't this... - Marie's job. Yeah. Isn't this what Marie's supposed to do? For your housewarming gift, 'cause I know I didn't get you anything, You know, money is a little low this month. Okay. I'm gonna clean up this whole entire mess for you. - For real? Dude... - Honestly, this is Marie's job. But have you seen her hands, how soft they are? If she like chips and nail or something, bro... Dude, you guys are obsessed. She's actually obsessed with me. I'm kind of chill, you know, how I am, like... Yeah, yeah. Okay. Listen, I'm gonna go take Lola for a walk. If you actually clean this up, I'll be so hyped. Whole thing. It's gonna be gone when you get back. If you think that's going to help with Marie, it's not. Well, I don't want her to, like, sweat or anything. The way she was looking at me, like up and down and... - Bro, she was blinded by me. - Okay. I don't know what else to say. She likes me, and I think I already won the competition if there even is one. Uh, have fun with all this mess. - Can you believe the FaZe guys? - What? They literally don't think that I can live by myself. Bro, you're 23. Don't they all live in a freaking house together? Talking about I can't live by myself. They can't live by themselves. It puts me in a position where I have to prove them wrong. I have to show them that I can't go back to my mom and dad's house. Yo. What's up, brother? What are you... What are you doing? The trash bags. I was trying to Postmates trash bags. I couldn't find... Where do you store them? Do you hide them or something? So that people don't take them? They are... The FaZe guys have, like, the history of, like, stealing trash bags. You mean the trash bags in the pantry, right? Oh, my... Why didn't I think of that? 'Cause you didn't even look. I-I looked everywhere. Here are the trash bags. So, should I... I should cancel the Post... I didn't do it yet, but you still want me to get more trash bags? I was literally on Postmates trying to get some. Dude. Uh, I... Seriously, I think I... Come here. I think I sat on a chip or something. - Ew. What? - Yeah, right here. I don't know. It probably fell in between the cushions. Careful when you chuck that, because if you get it on the floor, - it'll be harder to bag. - Yeah, yeah, I know. - Bro, clean it. Come on. - All right. First thing when I wake up tomorrow, this thing... No, we need to clean this right now. Dude, get up. No way. - What? - FaZe-branded trashcan? - Oh, dude, yeah. You didn't see that? - That's so sick. Dude, you already know we're taking over the world. Wait, bro, where are you going? Well, I'm going back inside. I'm tired. You have to actually bring these down, bro. - Wait, what? - Yeah, they don't just come and get it. Right here? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Are you good? - No, no. - I got it. - I got it. - No. It's cool, I got it. You're spilling it everywhere. - We're good. - Got it? - Don't worry. I got it. - You got it. All right, let's just go inside. Okay. ShermanTheVerman with the camera today. Yeah, that was a little too close. Follow me. You want to be a successful YouTuber, right? Uh, no. I just want to be like a regular YouTuber. When you start your videos off and you say, "What's going on guys? ShermanTheVerman here." Nobody wants to see that. - You see my videos? - Yeah, how are... - "What's going on guys? FaZe Rug here." - Wow. As annoying as it is, the viewers are, like, woken up. They're like, "Oh, shoot this guy's energy's on another level." But I thought you're going to punch me through the camera or something. What's going on, guys? Give it a try because you're very dull. - What's going on, guys? FaZe Rug here. - Ooh, I like that! Am I gonna be FaZe Rug? Remember when we filmed us taking the trash out the other night? Is that, like, content that I'm supposed to be filming? Just hold this real quick. So there's a guy watching us. - A guy watching us... - Yeah. Take out the trash. - I don't know who that is... - Why did you guys... What was the concept of the idea? - Bro, we film everything. You know this. - Take the trash out, I'll give you a thousand dollars? Wait is that... Dude... - What? - Is that the guy, that homeless dude? Is that the same... I'm just wondering why you guys recorded yourself taking the trash? So literally in front of that weird house. The one that freaking squirted on my shirt. I don't know. I just get bad vibes from this whole neighborhood. - I do... - Oh, my God. Just take this camera. You look at that. That's a weird. What're you doing? Look, look at this. Look, where you are. This is a $10-million house. Actually, I clickbaited. It's five million. Don't overthink it. Look... I get it. But listen, put yourself in my shoes. If you took out the trash at midnight... - Here. - If you took, if you took the trash out at midnight... It's like, I'm FaZe Rug, and I have... - Oh, you're walking in his shoes! - I have 10 million subscribers! I mean, 17 million subscribers. I'm in a $5-million house. I'm freaking living my life. You're dumb. You're ridiculous. I'm out of here. - What the? - What's gotten into that guy? I don't know, like, you get me though, right? I get it but at the same time, he is, right. Just trust me. Close your eyes. Trust me. Me and Noah have been working hard on this, okay? It's a little gift, but, you know... - You know, I don't trust you. - No, trust me, bro. Trust me. We noticed how you kind of been feeling a little down lately? - Do you trust me or not? - No. - Dude, put your, put your... - I don't trust Noah either. Why are you guys just giggling? - Ouch! - Don't. Keep your eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed. Keep your... I'm sorry. Keep your eyes closed. Oh, my God. You guys are acting very suspicious. Oh, no. For real. For real. Three, two, one. Is there a snake in there? - No, no. Just open it. - Just open it and find out. - What do you mean? - Just open it. There's no snake. - How does a box look suspicious? - I don't know. It's you guys. - Okay. - Ooh, let's go. - Oh, gosh. Hold up. - You're gonna love it. Wait, what is that? Is that a drone? - Yup. - This is so sick! I can't even see it anymore. Where is it? - It's all the way down the neighborhood. - Lower it. Oh, wait, wait. I'm trying to go to the right. Yo, look at this guy posing! - What is he doing? - Is he naked? I think he's taking... I think he's doing a TikTok. Is that yoga? - Wait. - What do you mean? - That's yoga. - Its yoga all right. - Don't worry about it. - Thank you so much for this. You guys are honestly the best. - You know we got you. - I appreciate that. - Oh, Brian, Brian, Brian! - Oh, my God, what... - Fix it. - No! What do I do? What do I do? I'm trying. - No, no, no, no! Oh! - Oh, no! - Wait, what happened? - The drone crashed. Stop, stop, stop. She's okay. Jut act casual. Just act normal, okay? We're getting sued. - You think so? - Oh, my God. Are you okay? What happened? Are you okay? - Are you alright? - Did something happen? It hit me in the head. - Wait, are you okay? - I don't know. - Who would do that? - Who the heck would... fly a drone in this beautiful neighborhood? What the heck? You know what? I'm going to get to the bottom of this for you. This is, this is absurd. Sorry. This is absurd. You feel like you're going to pass out? It's okay. It's okay. Let's just go. Thank you, ma'am. Hope you feel better. You feel any pain in your, in your head? No nausea? Anthony, let's go. Stop. She's good. Thank you. It's so nice to meet you. Bye. That was actually a cheap drone if it didn't capture that footage. - Whoa, whoa. - Seriously. Buddy, buddy, buddy. We've spent a lot of money on that. Yeah, you guys crashed it. It's probably corrupted. - We'll look at it after. Let's just go eat. - I'm pretty hungry too. No, I'm trying to see the house, and it literally, like, cuts out right before I get to the house. Oh, you wanna see the house so bad? Just go on Maps. I mean, is it, like, up-to-date? Am I going to see how it looks right this second? Yes, up-to-date. How do you think I find all the local moms in my area? Okay. You guys see something in this picture? - Seriously. - I see a lot of houses. Yeah, I know, but like, what do you see in this area? What do you want me to say? I see a house. This looks like hair. Right? - These look like eyes. - Okay. These look like I eyebrows. A nose and a smiley face. Okay, we're going to go check out the house. - No. No, no, no. - Yes. You wanna eat? You wanna eat? - Yes. - We're gonna go check out the house. Oh, my God. Can I get cheese itelie? They're leaving. They're leaving. Hold on, wait for them. This guy's out of his mind. We're literally breaking the law. Brian, I don't think this is a good idea. Of course you guys don't think it's a good idea. Come on, breaking into a house is supposed to be a good idea? We're just checking it out. We're trespassing. This isn't trespassing. This is 25 to life. Who else does that? Please, bro, come on, dude! I'm gonna go to prison for life. I'm gonna get the death penalty. People are gonna do, like, news reports on me. I'm gonna... Maybe that'll shut you up. Every curtain, every curtain is closed. - They're probably old. - What do you think this is? - What is that? - Stop peeking through their window. - Brian... - That's not illegal. It's not our house. I don't care. I don't think this is a good idea. - Are we in? - I mean, I get it. It's a circus out here. Sher... So I'm saying they still, they could still be home. Okay, they can't see us. So what's the plan now? I mean, if they're not home, then we could kind of have... - We could have some fun. - What? - We could have some fun. - Are you out of your mind, Brian? Anthony, Anthony, just one minute. They're not home. You're gonna like this. Come on. Noah, Come on in. Film it. All right, if we get caught, like, what do we... Whoa! I haven't been in a bounce house in so long. Noah, Noah! Where are you guys? - Dude. What the hell just happened? We have to get out. Hurry up, hurry up. Come here. What happened? - Oh, my God, we broke it. - No, no, We gotta go. - We gotta go. - This is not good. Bro, we're gonna get in so much trouble. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Get down, get down! Get down! We're done. We're done! - Did he see us? - I don't think so. I don't think so. Hide, hide, hide. He's coming, he's coming. Go, go, go, go, go. Keep going, keep going, keep going. - We'll get caught. - To the right. To the right! This way, you idiot! Watch where you're going? - I'm, I'm so sorry. - Stop. I'm not making any noise. - Should we tell? - No, we have to. It's messed up if we don't. Did you guys get the footage uploaded? Yeah, we got the footage. Okay, let's go see it. Where do you, where do you watch it? What are the odds... Really think about what are the odds... The odds of what? That you were right about everything that you said to me and Noah. - You guys believe me now? - I believe you. Yes, 100%. What did you guys see to make you say that? Bro... I told you and I told you. I told both of you guys. You guys didn't believe me. Look at that. It's a guy in clown makeup in broad daylight. Nobody just does that. Wait, so that means we were being watched in the bounce house. The guy that we thought was homeless watched us take out the trash. What is going on? There's clowns. There's clowns next door. Can we please just leave this alone? - Yeah, you're right. - Leave this alone? - We shouldn't go back... - I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. And I have the perfect way to do it. - And you guys are... - Calling the cops. No, we're not calling the cops. All three of us are gonna do a stakeout. - What? No. - No, I'm not doing stakeout. Who was with you in the haunted tunnel? - We're starting this. - Who was there when we played the Ouija board. - You were. - Okay. So do you trust me? - Obviously, I trust you. - Okay. But it's not even up to you. I have a dentist appointment tonight. - I'm getting my... - Me too. I'm getting my right hand transferred with my left hand. - At the dentist? - Yeah, so that my thumbs - could be on the opposite side. - That's cool. Okay, We're here guys. Stakeout time. We got the binoculars. We got the In-N-Out. Hold up, hold up, hold up. - Ooh. - And if you guys get tired. Oh, Okay. That makes this a lot better. Exactly. Walkie talkies, baby. - Ready? Watch this. Watch this. - Are you an idiot? - Sherman. - I'm right here, dumb-ass. Why are we spying on people? - Yeah, yeah. Why are we spying on people? - That's not the point. - You guys agreed to it. - How long is this going to take? 'Cause my friend Morrison is at, uh, my friend's house. - Are you talking about Morty? - Morty, Morrison. Oh! Oh, oh! Is that them? Check, check. Is that them? No. We're good. We're going to be here for a hot minute. I'm not going to lie. We're going to be here for... Dude, I don't like hamburgers. Marie has probably finished cleaning the house. I don't care. Get some energy for Marie. - Let's go home, let's regroup... - Facts. - Let's go to sleep. - Get down, quick. - It's not them. - Do I look like someone who has stakeouts, Brian? I look like someone who... Hey, bro, like, you're not gonna see anything. I don't know, I mean... I'm, I'm still going to stay. Dude, I didn't commit to something for no reason. Look at this dude. Okay, watch this. Ready? - Are you recording? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Just wait. - Are you recording? - Yeah. Oh, good. - Oh! - What is that? Oh, they just came back. Get back, get back, get back. Hold on, hold on. Shh, shh, shh. - They just got back. - Anthony, wake up! Wake up! - I smell like shit! - Get up, get up! Get up, get up, get up!! Get down, get down! Shut up. Wait, look. Oh, they're here. - Oh, there's another one. - Wait, wait. Who's that? He's in a clown costume. You see that? - What is that? - What's happening? I don't know. Wait. Look, look! No, no, no. Bro, why are they dressed like that? What are they doing? Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell? Did she just fall? - Why's his hair green? - Look, there's more! Is that guy 7' tall? - How tall is that guy? Is he crawling? - What is that thing? - Is that a colored Afro? That guy has clown hair. I tell you, I'm telling you, they're clowns. She's crawling backwards. What the... She was crawling upside down. What? What just happened? That has to be impossible. No way. There's more. Another person. - How do they do that? - What the hell? Who are you living next to? I don't know! That's what I'm trying to tell you. Do we call the cops or like what? You're not gonna call the cops on people getting out of a car. - Is that illegal though? - I don't... - It's not illegal. - We can't just... We just witnessed the weirdest craziest thing of all time. How did they do that? I don't know. Why don't you send them an email? We have to check it out. - We have to! - Wait, what? - We have to check it out. - Okay. We have to do this for my channel too. Dude, it looks like a normal car. Hold on, hold on. You see anything? There's no trap door. Shoot! Let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here. What? Whoa! Whoa. What the hell are you doing? I'm preparing if they come to my house. This isn't Call of Duty. My neighbors are clowns. Do you not understand that? Maybe you should stop clowning around. Dude, you literally just don't get it. When the clowns show up, who's the one that's gonna be prepared? Exactly. Me. - Marie. - Mmm? Hi, Marie. Hey. - Hi. - How do I look in this picture? You look good. - Oh, I look good? - Yeah. - How about, how does Noah look? - Dude, who did this? Who did this? Who put this outside? - I'm not playing. - We're in the middle of something. - What are you... - I put it outside. It came in box and it was little bit ripped so I take it out to see if... I didn't order this. - Did you guys order this? Be honest. - Of course you ordered it. You have so many toys that you know what? You don't even know what you have. - How did this end up here? - Okay, you have to tell me if you are on drugs, I'm gonna talk to your mom because you're acting weird. I'm not on drugs! Yes, Marie. Yes. - What does that... - It came with this. "Dear Rug," "welcome to the game." "Are you having fun yet?" It's the clowns. They know. They know we broke into their house. They know we popped their bounce house. They were watching us. They're pissed. What are they gonna do, swallow a sword in front of me? Are you ready for some movies? - I guess. - Let's do it. We should just like work something... Calm down, I look like... You look good. Sure. Okay. Well, are you gonna come with me to the store to pick it up? Your PC? Of course. "Crazy clowns in San Diego." Yo. - What? - Check this out. "Bobo's dog was mauled by a lion in a freak circus accident. - "Bobo went off the rails." - Yeah. That has to be his trigger! "Fire in the big tent. Ten people dead, skewered by a juggling knife. "No laughing matter. "His face hasn't been seen nor his signature giggle heard - "in over 30 years." - What the hell? "Next to every body was a note." "Want to play a game?" - Whoa... - Bro, I'm telling you, my neighbor's the clown. - No. No. - But it all makes sense. Hold on. "Although there has since been" "reports of individuals dressed in clown attire attacking local citizens," "there has been no concrete evidence to back these claims." "The case is still considered open and unsolved." - Noah! - What? - Come here. - Where are you? I'm in the, in the pantry. Yo! What are you doing? You need to help me film a video. Please? - I need a giraffe. - A giraffe? I need, uh, three quarts of motor oil. I need a 73-foot ladder. Hold on, have you seen the honey? - I have not. Wait... - Oh. Yo! What's up, brother? Look at what someone put on the front of my car. - Is that a clown nose? - I don't know. People keep messing with me while I'm out in public. - Looks pretty good. - No, no, that's not cool and what you guys doing here, anyway? Do you know anywhere that we could get a giraffe? - Giraffe? - Yeah. Three of them. One fully grown giraffe and one medium sized giraffe and a baby cat. I'm sick of these pranks. Tell everybody to stop pranking me. I'm serious. Maybe we could do, like a vlog, or I mean, I just posted one. I lean more towards like either a challenge or like something having to... - Yes. We gotta incorporate the wheel. - Oh! Bro, of course! For sure in the pool. - Okay. - We've been here a few days. - Weather's been nice. - It's hot. Why don't we use fans? Why don't we use fans? We can use fans for the challenge video. - That's a greater idea. - In the pool. Dude, what? Maybe it just creaks in the house. I don't know. There's no way. No one, no one's here but us. I know. I don't know. I mean, this house is huge, so. Wait, I set the alarm, right? Yeah, everything should be locked up. I swear the sounds were coming more down the hall. The light's on. If something pops out at me, - you're moving out. - I'm not... - You're moving out. - I'm not pranking you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Bro, I... That's not me! - Yo. - Bro, what is that? Is this that Anthony? Is he here? Bro, what is that? It's a clown shoe, and you know that. It has to be Anthony. It's Anthony. A 100% it's Anthony. He's pranking us. Anthony! Come out! ...right now if it was me. I would tell you right now if it was me. It's not me. Wow! So bright! What the heck is going on? What on earth is going on? Let me turn the light. Hold on. Turn it on, dude. Oh, my God! How did these balloons get in here? They broke in. They're here. They're here. Oh, my God. They're moving. How are they moving? What the hell? What was that? Wait, what's going on? No, no, no, no. All right, you guys got us. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Prank's over. All right, we... That's it. All right, we're done. Super funny. That's it. Who is it? What do you want from... - - AUTOMATED VOICE: Back door open. Where is he? Where did he go? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! In here, in here. Close, close! Do you see him? Do you see him? Nothing? Oh! Oh! Yes. Hello? 911? Yes. There's a clown in my doghouse. A man dressed as a clown in my doghouse. Send someone over. Yes, I have a house made for my dog. But that's not the point. Please send someone over. Yes, I'm in danger. Please. Come on. Send someone over right now. It's just me! Open this door! Yes. Dude, open the door. Bro, are you kidding me? Why did you kick me so hard? So, so so. I'm so sorry. It was my brother, Brandon. He just... - Bro! - ...pulled a crazy prank on me. What do you have on your shoes? Like a knife? - Why would you kick... - What is wrong with you, bro? - It's a prank, bro. - No, that's not a freaking... You pranked me a lot worse, bro. This isn't a prank. This isn't a prank. You gave me a heart attack. I called the cops. Okay, well, the FaZe guys promised me a new Devin Booker Jersey. If I pranked you like this. - I'm done. No clowns! - You called the cops on your own brother? Yeah. So I'm being chased around my house. I'm scared out of my mind. I call the cops and it turns out to be Brandon. It's just not cool, Mom. Yeah, I know. I'm good, you know, just trying to get used to the whole house. I'm just like a little homesick. I knew it would happen when I moved out. But it actually hit me hard. I know. I understand. Remember, even us, when we moved from the old house to the new house, it was hard. - When I moved from my country here... - Yeah. For a month straight, I was crying to go back. - Really? - Crying everyday for my family, friends... - You get used to it. - Yeah. - You're a great kid. - I'm getting old. I'm not, I'm not a little boy anymore. Hey, you're my little munchkin. I'll never stop saying that. Nice. Good shot. Good shot. Bro, come on. He was right in front of you. Come on, Come on. Get me! Get... Oh gosh! Down again. Come on. Help me out here. All right. Let me beat the Gulag. Easy. Let's go. Oh, now I'm down. Come on. Pick me up. He's right in front of you. Come on. He what? Took off his armor? - Am I gonna hit the camera? - No... You're not going to hit the camera. If I break it, I'm not paying for it. Okay, you don't have to pay for it. - Just hit the trick shot. - Oh, oh, oh. - Hey! - One more. One more. Who put this in my room last night? What is that? Bro, look at it. Who put this on my... - Is that yarn? - ...nightstand last night? I know it was one of you guys. What is that? What are you talking about? You guys didn't do this? - No. - I'm actually so confused right now. - What are you talking about? - Okay if I find out it was one of you guys, you're out of the house. I'm serious. You really think he's gonna kick us out? - Was it you? - No. Why would I put a red nose... Why'd you put a random nose on... I'm gonna find out who did this. Hello? Hey, Marie. How are you? Did you put the nose on my nightstand? The red nose. She probably thinks he's so weird. - You know what I'm talking about. - I know, right. I'm not talking crazy. Marie, please just let this go. You could find someone else to work for. I just don't wanna work with you anymore. No hard feelings. It's me, not you. And thank you for everything you've done. Anthony said he'll miss you. Okay, that didn't go well. What did she even say to you? She was cussing me, called me a pendejo, and I'm not a pendejo, I don't know what that is. I think things might go back to normal. I think she was the one causing everything. Did she say anything about me? Yes. She said for you to call her, so... Yeah, I feel so much safer now that Marie's gone. Mom even told me she left town, like, of course it had to be her. It's obviously not too scary... No, I'm really good. ...but like scary enough to the point that, like, you know, it'll get people's attention. Oh. Can I please just call you back in a little bit? Yo. Did you guys do that? No. You didn't put those there? I was literally about to make my mom's food. - Did you put those in? - No, I didn't touch the fridge. - That's weird, bro. - Someone had to have broken into our house. - This is crazy, bro. - I told you it was Marie. We have to call the cops. You sure you didn't do that? - I didn't touch the fridge, Anthony. - What the hell. We're calling the cops. Dude, call the cops. Bring that camera. - - AUTOMATED VOICE: Front door open. Hey, thank you guys for coming. Are your parents home? Uh, no, no, I own this house. You own this house? - Yeah. - There's no adult here? That... That's me. I'm 23. Okay. You mind if we come in? Yeah, yeah. No, please, come on in. So it's like... Uh, I feel like my neighbors have been messing with me lately... No, no. We put the complaint in to your neighbors. - Okay. - He denies everything. - He denied it? - Mmm-hmm. Well, I mean, of course he's gonna deny it. He's not gonna confess and go to jail. Well, the thing is, they're saying that you were trespassing on their property. Mmm... No, I've never... You don't know anything about that? No, I, we... No, I didn't. Said you burst his bounce house. Uh, what is that? You don't have any proof? Just a hunch? Just the pies in the freezer. Maybe you could get, like, their fingertips. So I see your camera. So if this is a prank... Oh, no, no, no. This is a big house. You'd think you'd have some security, right? I do. But it didn't capture them, it just... Sir... And I'm gonna call you sir now - 'cause you're an adult. - All right. Don't call us out again. We come three times, we're hauling you off, - no joke. - Okay. - You understand? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - We're all understood. - Yes. We're going to thank you guys for coming. So can we, um... Can we get a selfie? - Selfie? - Get in the middle there. Wait, so, are you guys pranking us? All right, let's go do deuces here. - Deuces! - Hey! Did you get that on camera? So the cops are not on our side anymore. I'm done. All I know is that I'm done. I'm moving out tomorrow. - I'm leaving. - Wait, what? People breaking into my house and the cops aren't gonna help us. What are we supposed to do? Something else we could do about it, probably. No. Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m., I'm out. House is on the market. Oh, shoot. I think I just heard something. I think I just heard something from my bathroom. I swear to God, if they're in my house again, they're gonna get a bat to the head. Oh! Oh, oh, oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mmm. Ah. Okay. Mmm. Okay. Okay. What the... What is it? Oh, my God. Where did he go? Where did it go? Okay. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - There's someone outside. - What? What? - There's someone there. - What are you talking about? I saw them through the window. Someone's here. - This place. - What? What? What's coming through down there? - Door's locked. - I don't know. Go check, quick! Quick. Check the front door. - Look out. - It was locked. Okay. Oh, shoot. What's up with the light? Okay. Come on. Whoa! Oh, dude! What are we supposed to do? - No, no, no. - Why? - What? - They're right there. Oh, no. - What? - What is that? What? What the hell are you guys doing? Oh, my God. They're in the hose. Someone's at the door. Go. Just watch it, man. What is that? What the hell is that? - You see that? - - AUTOMATED VOICE: Front door open. But what is in that thing? What the hell? Bro, what? Wait, is that supposed to be... Is that supposed to be me? Oh, oh, oh. Dude, hold on. Lola, come here! Lola! Lola! Lola, come here! Wha... No! Lola. Give her back! Lola! We gotta get her back. No, no! No, you're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. My neighbors are clowns. They broke into my house, they're terrorizing us, and now they have my dog. This isn't a prank. They think this is a... No, we're not pranking anybody. What do you mean you don't believe me? I'm not joking. I was never joking. I'm... They hung up. - So what are we gonna do? - No, stop. You've been pranking me. You've been pranking me, the FaZe guy's pranking, my mom doesn't believe me. Nobody's believing me. So I got this, all right? I got it. Dude, if we pull this off, no one can ever tell me I can't do this on my own. Why do you need recognition from other people? Why don't we just not go in the house? And let them keep my dog? Dude, use your brain. - Call the cops. - Let them keep my dog? This is the worst idea that you've ever had. Stop walking towards the house! Just let me talk... I'm going in with or without you. Without me. - Noah? - I'm in. What do you mean you're in, dude? - Are you stupid? - I'm in. No, I'm going with him. I'm looking out for you guys' safety. - Let's do it. - Let's do this. Oh, my God. Do you guys not listen to a word anyone tells you? You're gonna get yourself killed. Lola. Lola. Lola. Oh. What is that? Oh. Come here, girl. - This house is so creepy. - I know. Wait, what's that? - Is that a... - Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Look at that. Nobody has that in their house. Look. She's in there. What? We have to go in there. Oh! We're gonna go. I think we have to. Lola, come here. Come here, Lola. Lola, girl, come here. We gotta go. Watch your back. Oh, what the hell? What kind of twisted people are they? She's in there. Bro, we gotta go. Go in. Brian, if you're out there, I just want you to know that I love you. You're like my brother. You bought me my first car. Even though I crashed it after a month. Noah... I mean, we could always find another filmer, but still, bro, like, you're pretty good at your job. I'm at a loss for words. We just lost two great... two great, uh... one and a half great people. Lola. Did you hear her? Lola! Yoo-hoo! - You're early, sailor. - Run! Run! Run! This way! No, no! Come here! Follow me! Quick! This way, this way! Come on, over here. Ah. Ah! Oh, I don't know... What is this place? Wait. The door. Where'd the door go? Where's the door? Where's the door? We're trapped. Where... Where's the door? How are we gonna get out of here? - I don't know. We gotta find something. - What do we do? - Where's Anthony? - Find the door. Try to knock it down. - Let's get... - No, bro, what... We gotta get back to Anthony. Let's get back to Anthony. - No. - Please. Welcome to my house! Where's my dog? Oh, your dog! Where is she? Is she safe? Safe? Hmm. Well, we're having lots of fun with her. Please, I want this to end. I'm done. I'm done messing around. Oh, but I'm just getting started. This isn't fun! Where's my dog? Well, why don't you go and look for her? Brian. Brian! There's an exit. We gotta get out of here. - Brian! - Come on! Come on! Come on! Paws. They go to the door. Oh. Oh. Is he behind you? Oh, no. Watch your back. Lola! I think I heard her. I think I heard her. Lola! Lola! - I think I hear her from there. - Okay. Lola! You ready? Shoot! It's a brick wall. Please! Help! Run, run, run! No! Run! It was paper. Anthony, what are you doing here? You guys are my brothers. My best friends. We're the trinamic trio. Of course I'm gonna come back here and save your dumb asses. This is the worst idea you've ever had. This is worse than going into the tunnel. Hey, what is this? What the hell? This place is so creepy. Why are we on it? - What is it? - I don't know! I don't know. We have to do something. We should go that way. It might be a trap. What's that? Oh! It's a look-alike. Come here. What is that? I don't know. - Which way? - I don't know. Let's go this way. Get down, get down, get down. Where'd she go? I don't know. She could be behind us. Where do we go? I think there's an exit over here. - Do you see anything? - No. Wait, wait, wait. Shh. What was that? It's right on the other side. I'm coming! Hey! Brian! Oh! Oh! What the... No, no! Guys! Anthony! Anthony, where is she? Shit. Shit! Oh, shit. "Top score, save your friends." "Anything else, certain death." Forty-five seconds. - Brian, please! - Forty-four seconds. - Hold on. - 43... I don't wanna die! I'm not even 21 yet. Brian! 39, 38... Shit. This is fake. What do I do? I freaking hate clowns! 35... - Brian! - ...34, 33, 32... What do you guys want? What do you want? I'm coming! - 28, 27... - Oh. Okay. Okay. ...26, 25... You don't want me. I didn't even mess with you. It's not even my dog. Please, keep the dog. Keep the dog. Brian! ...20, 19... Oh, my God. Help!

We have to get out of here. Oh, dude, what the f... Why is it so dark? - What is it? - I don't know. I don't... Find the light, find the light. Quick. Quick. I hear her! She's literally around the corner. Lola! Lola! Brian, no! Brian! Brian! Dude, what the hell is down there? Brian! We have to go right now. No, no, no. We gotta find another way. We don't know what's down there. Brian! Let's go. We have to find another way right now. Let's go. Noah, come on. Noah, I'm not messing around. Let's go. Oh, what the hell? What the hell is this? Lola. Lola! Lola, baby. Come here! Come here. Oh, my God, I love you. Are you hurt? Let me see. Oh, I missed you so much. I missed you. Oh, my God, Lola. Oh, baby. Let me see your paw. Did he do anything to you? Oh, Lola. Come here. I missed you so much. I missed you. I missed you, I missed you. Did they do anything to you bad? Did they do anything to you? Oh, boy. What are you doing? Come on. Lola, come here. Come here. Let's go. Let's go, Lola. Girl, come here. Come on, girl. We gotta get out of here. - We gotta go... - Hello. What are you doing? - Just relax, relax. - Wait, wait... We're just clowning around, all right? - Wait, what's going on? - We're just clowning around. Just having a laugh, right? - No, this is... - It's a laugh. No, I'm not laughing. You know what was fun? When we first realized that you was moving into the neighborhood. And you know what we thought to ourselves? Finally, finally, finally, finally, finally someone to have some fun with. You know what? You're gonna die like the rest of 'em! You're gonna die here! You're the freak! You're gonna die here! You die here, kid. - Oh, oh! - Shh! What the... Police! Everybody down! You, down! You, hands up! Thank you so much. Like, honestly, we could not do this without you y'all. We needed y'all to come down here, ID the guy and, you know, save the day. This was the, uh... the case for 32 years? - Thirty-two years, yeah. - What? - Uh, Operation Crimson, yeah. - Mmm-hmm. Thirty-two years we've been working on this. Everyone in the precinct, they are celebrating y'all. Y'all are heroes. Like, you're a hero, man. - I appreciate it. - A hero! - Thank you. - They're saying I'm a hero. No, she said me. You... You were like the sidekick. This would have helped if we didn't get our lives in danger. My cousin's life was in danger, my life was in danger. Well, I was good, I... I did taekwondo in third grade. No, we could tell that y'all knew what y'all were doing and that y'all were fully capable to handle this. - Yeah, we've seen your videos. - We've seen your videos. Like, y'all are smart kids. They kind of used us as bait. Nah. Uh... Pretty much, yeah, bait. Like, um, clickbait. Clickbait. I don't think you're using that term correctly. Like, put you in danger. But that's not what it means. We're just trying to get on y'all's level. - Sorry. - Okay. - No, it's all good. Um... - We should go. Thank you, guys. I hope to never see you guys again. Not in a bad way. No offense. - W-Wait, wait. - I appreciate it. - We got... - Come back, come back. - Whoa, wait, what? - A little favor. - It's a tiny little favor. - Yeah. So that selfie that we did last time went viral. - You know, blew up. - Okay. - We got 200 followers now. - Two hundred likes. - We're doing big league stuff. - That's right. So we want to do a TikTok version. Get that new stuff going. I'm actually in like a rush. - Yeah, we... - We gotta get home. Well, it... It'll be real quick, so... Real quick. We can actually, like, do it how y'all do it. - Yeah, yeah. You ready? - Right now? Wassup, everybody? You know, it's the Face Cops. - Hey, Cop 1. - Cop 2. And we doin' it! Yeah, we are doin' it.
