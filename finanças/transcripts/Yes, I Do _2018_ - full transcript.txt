[♪♪♪] It's a big day. Good luck, son. Thank you for coming. [laughing nervously] I'm having trouble breathing. I'm breaking out. He'll understand, right? Oh... [bride]: I don't know what's wrong with me. I love him... I really do. There's a wedding about to happen. I know. You're in it. Oh... Okay, it's okay. You don't have to. I'm sure he'll understand. I'm horrible. No, you're not. You're a good person. It's okay. Do you want to do this? I... Do you? I do... not. Go... Go, go! Oh, Charlotte... [church bells ringing] Hey. Thanks for coming. [pastor]: Please be seated. Friends, we have joined here today to share with James and Charlotte in holy matrimony. In their time together, they have seen their love and their understanding of each other grow and blossom, and now have decided to live out the rest of their lives as one. Do you, James Cooper, take Charlotte to be your wife? I do. Do you, Charlotte Bennett, take James to be your husband? Charlotte? Do you? I do... not. [James, sighing]: Again? [rain spattering] Charlotte! I'm so sorry. Good morning! Hi! Everything looks good. Looking good. Oh, Charlotte, my dear. Take a look. Tell me what you think. I love it. Good. I'm going to do an entire collection for the wedding. The wedding? Great! Great... That's great. Okay... What do you think? Okay, it's ridiculously expensive, but how many times does a girl get to be Maid of Honor three times with the same bride? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Charlotte? The wedding's still 30 days away. You just have to get over the actual wedding part. Think about everything you have going on in your life right now. You have a meeting with the editor-in-chief of Chocolate Monthly Magazine with the chance of winning their next big contest. You have plans to open your next shop, not to mention the hype around creating your next, big flavor which no one's ever tasted before. I mean, compared to all that, this wedding thing? It's a piece of cake. Bad reference. The point is, it'll be easy. Achieved with very little effort. Presenting few difficulties. Adjective. See? You're doing that define the word thing you do without even knowing you do it, that James finds so cute and everyone else finds annoying. It's a sign. He does think it's cute, doesn't he? Mm-hmm. And he's handling everything wedding, so all you have to do is show up and say, "I do..." again. Hello, beautiful. Oh, let me get this here... What? That look on your face. What look? Of absolute trepidation. You're not... Just hear me out. You are. You're the one... I knew it. And what happened... twice... had nothing to do with you or us or anything like that. And we've been over all that, but it's all in the past, right? Right. Yeah, I love you. I love you, too. I love you more than anyone in the whole world, and... I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and have a family with you, and grow old with you, and... But...? No buts. Okay, there's a but. Look, I don't know what it is, James, okay? It's like I've developed some sort of... hyper-sensitivity to weddings, and not just our own wedding, okay? When I go to a friend's wedding, I just... I don't know... it's like I literally break out into hives or something. You know? I mean, ours is a month away, and I'm already starting to get the itch. Okay, a hyper-sensitivity to weddings, which causes you to break into hives? You do know that's not physically possible, right? Well, says who? Says any reasonable person, Charlotte. I'm a reasonable person. Until you start over-thinking things. I mean, you analyze and calculate and ponder every possibility instead of just letting things be what they are... which works great for your business and your masterful chocolate creations, but not... in a relationship. I know. It's all set. I've planned everything. I haven't even mentioned the word "wedding". I've been calling it the "exchange of vows" day. Yeah... It's paid for. Guests have been invited. I just... can we just... just... wait... a teensy-weensy bit longer? I think I've been a teensy-weensy bit patient already. You left me at the altar... twice... and guess what, I understood why. I mean, you were taking over the chocolate factory. Business was booming. It was busy times. You were amazing. I can't go through it again. James, it's just a phobia, okay? I'll get over it. I'm going to work on it, and I am going to get over it. Look... I told you, I don't want to elope, okay? I want a wedding. I want a grand wedding, like the one I've always dreamed of. Yes, guys dream of weddings, too. Not in a park, or on a beach, but in a church. Like I wanted to the first time. with someone... who wants to get married, not just be married. Goodbye. Are you ready to order? We have an amazing dessert today. It's a chocolate tart made right here in town at Charlotte And Her Chocolate Factory. Oh, my gosh. It's you. Yeah... yeah, it's me. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] I'm so sorry. She's never late. Remind me of your name again? Hannah Reid. I'm the factory manager, and her best friend. You're sure she knew the meeting was today? Mm-hmm. I'm just going to give her a call again. Good idea. Charlotte! It's me, again. Ms. Sweeney is here? Founder and Editor in Chief of Chocolate Monthly, soon to name America's best chocolate... ring a bell? She's waiting... patiently. Where are you? She'll be here. [Charlotte]: I couldn't get out of bed! I totally forgot! Was she mad? No, actually, she was very nice about it. What did you tell her? Food poisoning. Ugh... I'm so miserable without him. Then be with him. It's just the wedding. If getting married is your greatest fear, then let it scare you. Just don't let James know it scares you. What do you mean? There's an old saying... the definition of courage is being the only one who knows you're afraid. Mind over matter. That's it. What if I break out again? Tell him it's pollen! I... Do you love him? Of course I do. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with him? I do. Do you want to have a family with him and laugh with him and cry with him and grow old with him? I do! See how easy it is to say, "I do"? Yes! Yes, I just have to prove it to him, right? I have to find the right words, you know? So he'll hear the sincerity, right? He'll know it's different this time. Yes! Do it! But what if... Go! Conquer! Just don't wear that. Hi! Hi. You busy? Just, you know, the usual. Servicing these helicopters never seems to end, you know? Yep. Any luck? My grandfather's convertible? No, um.... I got a tip from somebody that said that it was sold to a guy in California who restores and sells them, so... still kind of hoping it pops up. Well, I know your grandfather would be really proud that you're trying so hard to find it again. Yeah. Five years. Haven't given up yet, so... It'll happen. What's up, Charlotte? You didn't come here to talk about my family, did you? I really need an oil change. Oil change? Huh. I changed it a month ago. I have been doing a lot of driving. 6,000 miles? -Maybe. -Wow. Do you have money? What, you're charging me now? I'll give you a coupon. I didn't... I didn't come here to get an oil change, but the word "change" is important. Look, I've changed, okay, James? I can see. I can see that this, this fear, it's irrational maybe, of the whole wedding thing, but I mean, this time, you really showed me, you know? I am over the fear. Do you still want to marry me? I do... not. I deserve that, yeah, and you deserve to be mad, but listen, in 30 days, I am going to be at that altar. Okay, look, Charlotte... I love you... but... there's a reason you haven't gone through with it. I'll be there! You'll see. I canceled everything, Charlotte, okay? Church, guests, caterers, all of it. There's nowhere for you to be in 30 days. Sorry. Yeah. 'Kay. I'm not going to let him be the one who got away. That's rich. Look, I know my track record, okay, but I can see clearly now. The rain is gone, and you can see all obstacles in your way. Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind. Okay, ha-ha. You laugh, but I'm going to make him believe in me. How? It's so obvious. The wedding. One slight hiccup... you said he already canceled the wedding... everything. So I'm going to uncancel it. No, no, no, no, I'm going to... I'm going to do better than that. I'm going to give him the wedding of his dreams. I'm going to organize it and design it, and most importantly, I'm going to be there. Yeah. In 30 days, I'm going to say "I do!" [mother, on Skype]: I'm sorry for not taking you seriously, but James is right. You won't go through with it. Just promise you'll come. Real estate is booming in New York. I hardly have a minute to myself, much less another trip across the country to watch you say you won't. I won't. You know, if your father was still alive, he would agree with me. You're a lovely girl, Charlotte. You're just not meant to get married. It's a new age, dear. Spinster doesn't have the same stigma it used to. Uh... Bad connection, Mom, got to go. Call me any time. Love you. Love you. Spinster... So... Planning a wedding? Planning a wedding. Right, yeah. Let's make a list. List... yes, good. Wedding dress. Wedding dress! You already have one... two. I didn't keep them. You're only supposed to wear them once, right? Number three was only a month away. You didn't shop for a dress? I was putting it off. Okay, now you're going to be putting it on. So that's number one. Venue... church. What church did he want, same one? Yeah, yeah, James never wanted to do it outside. Book the church. Flowers, new invites... everyone's going to need to be told it's back on. Cake, food, music... band or D.J.? [thudding] Wha...? I'm good! I'm good! ♪ Ooh, pretty, pretty ♪ Ooh, ooh Ooh, pretty woman ♪ ♪ Pretty, pretty ♪ Ooh, pretty woman Oh, my gosh. Charlotte, look at this one. Oh, no... Charlotte, look. He'll die. [gasping] Oh, no, no, no. This one. It just... it just gushes. So do you. You would look dashing. Oh, best not to use the word "dash". Well, there is a number of selections upstairs. We could run up there and take a look. Ix-nay on the un-ray. I can't... I can't do this. Sorry. [sneezing] It's okay, we'll... we'll ease into it. Okay, all right. Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? Your delivery van is due for maintenance. Didn't you do that last week? Did I? Allergies? What? The... Oh, yes, allergies. Uh-huh. It's not allergy season. It is somewhere. So how did it go? How did what go? Didn't you have a meeting with the lady from the magazine yesterday? Yes, but no. I wasn't feeling well, so it's today. Ah... well, good luck. I meant what I said. I'm going to be at the altar this time. I've been planning our whole wedding by myself. Is that what this is? What, did you break into hives shopping for a wedding dress? Ha-ha. I have to get back to work. That's her. Oh! How do I look? Presentable. Okay. Ms. Sweeney. Oh, please, it's Nicole. Wow, you are even prettier in person. That's a very sweet thing to say. I work hard to stay... presentable. I don't know how you do it, surrounded by all this. At least I spend most of my days in a publishing office. Well, it's actually not a problem these days. I physically can't eat it without getting some sort of reaction. You're allergic? Yep, started a few years ago. And you make chocolate? Well, I still remember the flavors, so I do it by smell. I'm kind of a chocolate sommelier. It's weird. No, it's extraordinary. The same thing happens to me when I eat strawberries. My skin gets all prickly. It's terrible... but I don't make fruit tarts for a living. [laughing] You know, the irony of your situation, that is something I can market. I'm already seeing the cover. Charlotte, confectionary genius, can't enjoy her own creations, savors the world! I'm thinking talk shows. [Hannah clears throat] I think you met Hannah. -Yes, hello. -Nice to see you again. Well, uh, let me show you the factory. Great. Okay... Well, we have our own farm in South America, and then the beans are imported fresh, and they are cooked, mixed, and melted here. How do you derive your unique flavors? Um, there's no exact formula. It's more instinct. A dabble here, a dabble there, maybe a little cross-breed this bean with that. It's instinct. It's a gift. Picasso... Mozart... and Charlotte. Nicole, this is Oscar. It's very nice to meet you. This is his shop. Was his shop. Yes, well... I worked for Oscar for 10 years, and then I bought it from him two years ago. I've had a love for all things chocolate ever since the very first time I went trick-or-treating. I even went as a chocolate bar one year. Anyway, um, Oscar taught me everything I know. She taught me all the things I didn't. If God allowed me to pick a granddaughter, it would be this young lady. That's very sweet. Yeah, well, Oscar hand-makes everything, so he really is the Picasso. Ah, but it's the flavors that has those people lined up outside the door. Me, I'm just an extension of her brush. Well, these look great. Okay, thank you. So tell me more about this new flavor you're coming up with. Oh, it's a salty-sweet combination with a couple of twists. I'm still in the testing phase, but it's getting really close. I think it's going to be one of our most popular flavors yet. Well, have you thought of expanding? Oh, yes, a second store to start, and then my ultimate dream is to have a shop in Times Square. Silly. No, not at all, and if you win this contest, anything's possible, and it's perfect timing. Open up another shop, get people in other markets excited about your current line, and then, when your buzz is at an all time high, you knock it out of the park with your new chocolate. Well, that's the plan. This is something I take very seriously. The competition is stiff. I've been traveling all over the country. So I would like to stay here for a few days, get to know the people who come here, your employees... Yeah, that would be amazing. Um, this is James, my fian... mechanic. He does all our mechanical... mechanic... stuff. James, this is... Nicole? Jimmy! Wow. It's been... a while. Wait, what? You look great. Not the same girl you let get away, huh? Let get away? It's great to see you. Great to see you. Charlotte, this is... Nicole, yeah. Yeah. I'm aware of that. I just introduced her to you. Yeah, no, um... that Nicole. That Nicole? I know... it's crazy, right? Yeah... I had no idea you were the lady from the magazine, right? That's me. I rebranded it as Chocolate Monthly, and everything just fell into place after... you and I broke up. Yeah. Well, it's great to see you. Absolutely delightful. I have some phone calls to make. We have a lot to talk about, Charlotte. Jimmy, we do, too. I'm staying at the Starboard Inn. Tootles. Tootles! Jimmy? Yeah. Small world, huh? Tiny. The same Nicole Sweeney, one of the world's most renowned chocolate connoisseurs? That's the Nicole he was dating before you? I only knew her as Nicole. Wow, for someone who doesn't like chocolate, he sure can pick 'em, can't he? It's like God laughing at me for leaving him at the altar... twice. And she has no idea about the two of you? No, and I don't want to tell her. Why not? Because it'll complicate the competition. Besides, you know how some women can be. She'll see me as the one who stole James's heart. You mean, broke his heart? I mean, if she finds out and thinks I'm some terrible person, then what is she supposed to think about my "fantastic creations"? I mean, you've seen her. She's gorgeous... which is so confusing to me because James always described her as being so... plain. Men always say that about ex-girlfriends. Doesn't mean anything. Okay, so what? She's his ex. It was, what, like, five years ago? He's in love with you. [breathing heavily] No, I'm good. I don't get it. I could walk through a whole poppy field in Oz, but wedding flowers... [sneezing] Mind over matter. Mind over matter. Yes. [Nicole]: Hello? Jimmy? So out of all of the chocolate factories in all of the world... Yeah. You really didn't know I live around here, huh? Not at all. I've never been. I've never met Charlotte either. She seems like a sweet girl. Yeah, yeah, very. Look at you. Your business has really... taken off. Right. But you're still doing odd jobs like fixing delivery trucks? Yeah, you know, I just... I like to help out where I can. How loyal. Heh. So how have you been? Great. Like I said, the magazine is going really well. Good. That's good. Uh, small talk is just so awkward, isn't it? We have so much to get caught up on. I thought you were engaged a couple of years ago. Uh... I was. Uh, am, or... I was. You were, or you are? I was. So, single then? You know, it's complicated. I like complicated. Ha... Let's grab dinner. Yeah, that would be complicated, too. Come on, what are the chances of us running into each other like this? It's fate. I feel like I'm giving up all my secrets here, but... I've missed you, James. We haven't seen each other in five years, Nicole. All the more reason. Look, I just... I can't right now. I'm swamped with everything, and... it's great to see you. So then coffee, tomorrow. Yeah, okay. Sure. Coffee. Great. There is no such thing as being allergic to weddings. You haven't seen it. I have a garden. I grow flowers. Flowers decorate my office, but wedding flowers? I can't stop itching. Dress materials, pollen in certain flowers, food allergens in a cake, maybe, but weddings, no. The only thing you're allergic to is chocolate. Yeah, and isn't that a cruel joke? Look, Charlotte, whatever is going on with you when it comes to these weddings, it's all in your head. It's a physical reaction-- the same thing that happens when I eat chocolate-- so what's what, Doc? It's psychosomatic. A physical illness caused or aggravated by a mental factor such as internal conflict or stress. Adjective. So is that, by the way. [Nicole]: You know, when I first read the article about your chocolate and how it was sweeping the area, and how people would drive hours just to come and have a taste, that was only half the story for me. Your profile was what impressed me, the story behind the flavor... this young, vibrant woman, following her passions, with business smarts that could rival any CEO in the country... but what hooks me was your reason for expanding, so that more people could experience the joy of your creation. Yeah, it's a bit hokey, though, huh? Mm-mm, no. It's authentic. So you really think I have a chance? My little factory against all the big chocolate giants out there? If your new flavor lives up to your reputation, you have a real shot. Great, um... fantastic! I'll walk you out. I like you, Charlotte. I feel like you and I could be good friends. Let's go out, hang. Okay. Sure. Could I ask your advice on something else, girl to girl? Of course. How well do you know Jimmy? James. I mean, I know he works for you, but other than that. Oh, I'd say pretty well. He just seems so... unhappy. He does? Clearly, he's still jilted by his ex-girlfriend, or ex-fiancée, whatever she was. I think he's still engaged. That's not what he said. Oh, he didn't? What did he say? I went to his place earlier today. It's clear he still has his walls up. He didn't go into detail, but a woman can tell, especially as well as I know him. She must have been a very, very manipulative woman. Well, I heard that she was very, very nice, and that she loves... loved him a lot. Like, a lot, a lot. What about you? What do you mean? He's attractive. You're... cute. I'm not butting in, am I? Butting in? He doesn't know it yet, but I intend on winning him back, and I thought, well, maybe you could talk to him and convince him people change. Oh, I knew we were going to be friends. If I thought I was stealing your man, I would be mortified. Me too. Yeah. [door buzzing] [door buzzing] Good morning. Yeah, it's, uh... 6:30 in the morning. Oh, is it? Sorry. I'm having some car trouble. I brought coffee. Oh. Great. So, what's wrong with your car? It's making a strange noise. Mm. A strange noise. What kind of noise? I don't quite know how to describe it. Mm-hmm. It's not really making a noise at all, is it? No. Okay, I just wanted to talk. And it couldn't have waited? No. I have to ask you something. Well, okay, ask away. Nicole. Is there still, like, a thing between you two? What? No, I... She thinks there is. I doubt it. Why didn't you tell her about us? Look, I just... I know how she can be, and unfortunately, it could jeopardize your chances of winning the contest... but look... there is nothing between the two of us. You mean... the two of you? Yeah. But obviously, we should keep us to ourselves, right? Well, I mean, that's up to you, okay? but knowing Nicole, yeah, that's probably for the best. Okay. Okay? Okay. Now I'm going to go get ready for the day. Thank you for that. Invites are going out soon. Everything's moving forward. I'll believe it when I see it. I'm counting on that. -Okay. -Okay. Bye. [♪♪♪] All right... Mm... Needs a dash of something. All right. You know, with the new bean, it's derived from four different cocoa beans. The planters thought I was crazy. You are. But it's going to be magical! All right, I think I'm ready to run it. Yeah, I'm ready to run it. Okay, I'm going to lower the temperature by one-third. I'm going to add a couple more ingredients once it's conched. If you could just finish stirring that. -I will do that. -Fantastic. Okay, small hiccup. James's church is not available, but I have a list of other options. What? No, it has to be at his church. It's very important to him. Okay, no need for panic. I'll put it back on our to-do. Also, we have some other items that need decisions. -Date night? -Date night. -I'll see you at your house? -Yeah. Okay. She's a good friend. Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without her-- speaking of which... are you still willing to walk me down the aisle? I haven't given up on you yet. Great. Thank you so much. Hey, listen, I have to run, I'm meeting Nicole for lunch, but keep doing what you're doing, it looks really good. Thank you. Okay, I'm practically busting at the seams. I've kept something from you, and I don't like doing that. I feel like you and I should be 100% honest with one another. Agreed? Yeah, agreed. Look, there's something that I... You don't have to be nervous. It hasn't been announced yet, and you have to be sworn to secrecy. Okay. Cross your heart. Yeah, cross my heart. Okay. The winner of the C.M.B.C.A.C... I'm sorry? Chocolate Monthly Best Chocolate in America Contest. We call it C.M.B.C.A.C. for short. Okay! Brace yourself. The winner... will have a storefront... in Times Square. You're joking? No. But that's... Your dream. I know. You in New York City. Anything is possible. Your life is about to change, young lady. It is? I mean, I can't choose favorites, but if your new flavor lives up to everything you've done... I'm just saying. Wow. Your ship has sailed in, and it's made of chocolate. Yeah, wow again. Change... [Hannah]: Okay, we need to send out invites, so we need addresses and numbers of James' family and friends. Oh, he has all that. Okay. Check. Flowers. Roses? James doesn't like roses. Peony. Peony... color? Light pink. Okay, pink, check. Maid of Honor, moi. Church... working on that. Dress? I emailed Mrs. Goodmanson. I am reordering the same dress from the second attempt. She said it should be ready by the wedding. Good, check. [doorbell ringing] Surprise! Quite. Okay, I know I should have called, but I sometimes get these spontaneous thoughts, and I just... I can't help myself. Let's hang! Okay, yeah, let's. Uh... Ms. Sweeney! Hi! Oh, I didn't realize you had company. Oh, it's all right. We're just hanging. What is that? What is what? Oh... Pictionary. We were playing a game of Pictionary. Oh, I love games! Let's play games. -Yes, let's. -Yeah! I'm so tired of work. Let's not discuss any business, agreed? Agreed. Okay, I'm going to go heat this up. I'm going to go pop it in the oven. Oh, you know what? I got it. It's okay... make yourself at home. So what was it? Uh... what was what? What were you drawing? Oh... that's the problem. I'm such a terrible drawer. I can't even remember anymore. Oh, come on, that's half the fun. Let me see. [Hannah]: No, I... I'm terribly embarrassed. [Charlotte]: Uh, you know what? I was thinking, why don't we just go out? I brought food. I'm just so... stir crazy. That was the word! It was stir... crazy. That's charades. We're flexible. [Charlotte]: So flexible that we thought, let's just get out of here, you know. Let's just go out, have some fun. What's going on? Nothing. I am very confused. That's because it's very confusing. Do tell. All right. Uh... well... turns out I'm the terrible, manipulative woman who broke James' heart. You? You said there was nothing... That's 'cause we broke up... sort of. I... I kind of... called off the wedding a few days ago. Didn't you already do that once before? Yes, and listen, I'm just... I'm trying to prove to James that it was a huge mistake. He planned all of the weddings before, so now I'm planning the next one. That's what we were doing. Well, I don't understand why you wouldn't just tell me. Uh... well, I tried, but we got distracted, and I just... I didn't really know how to word it... because you have a history with James, and you care about him... and suddenly, I was the Wicked Witch of the West. And you thought it was going to get in the way of the contest. [laughing] I mean, what kind of girl do you think I am? An ex-girlfriend? I don't blame you. I would have done the same thing. I'm really sorry I mislead you, and I really hope that we can still have an open, honest relationship... if there is still a relationship. With James? No... us? Do you love him? Oh, yes, very, very much. Well, then I won't interfere. You're not upset? No. As long as you promise me... you're not going to break his heart again. Yeah, never. Thank you so much. So... when's the big day? Uh, 25, 24-ish days. And he's aware? More or less. Which one? It's complicated. Well, I'm so happy for you. You have quite the month, with the contest and expanding business, and now you're getting married. Lucky girl. The food's on me. I'm going to leave you two at it. I really wish you and James the best... I won't get in the way. Uh, thanks again, and... have a good night. Do you believe a word of what she just said? Not a one. Why wouldn't you just tell me? I was worried it might interfere with you and Charlotte. That's what Charlotte said. That's nonsense. I told her the same thing. I'm happy for you. The two of you together are... #cute. Hashtag something anyway. Look, I know I came on pretty strong, but I couldn't help myself. I mean, you're a pretty great catch. Am I? I can't imagine a girl letting you out of her sight for a moment. You are far more forgiving than me. The girl has a track record, and in this case, literally a track record. She actually ran. Yeah, I know, I was there. Thank you, though. What makes it so different this time? What's changed? I'm kind of waiting to find out. [Nicole]: Okay, sure, it's a sweet gesture on her part, but I would hate to see you get hurt... again. Seems to me she's only doing this because you've said no for real this time... and they say people want what they can't have. Once she has you... poof, she's gone! I'm just saying this as your friend, of course. Of course. Oh! [clattering] I'm so sorry! [fake British accent] Go about your business. Nothing to see here. [Nicole]: You just need to look out for yourself. You're so forgiving. Yeah, would you give me one sec? I just... one second. [clearing throat] [fake British accent] Oh, excuse me, sir. I'm really sorry, I'm late for work. Oh, do I know you? No, definitely not. You're that chocolate lady, aren't you? Are you serious? What is all this? [normal voice]: I... mm... Look, she just... come on, look at her, right? She's charming, and she's trying to charm you. No, we were just catching up. Oh, yeah, I bet. Look, she knows about us. I know, she told me. She knows about me... my track record. That, too, yep. Well, and she wants you. That doesn't mean I want her. Well, maybe not now, but wait until she's like... "Well, I would have never left you at the altar, and I would never let you go, and you're the one for me, James." I mean, she's not going to say it exactly like that, but she's going to... Just say what, that she's happy for me, and that you're a great girl, and that the two of us look cute together? She said that? You're paranoid. No, just, just... embarrassed. How are the wedding plans going? Don't mock me. I'm not. Well... for your information, they are going very well, okay? I am going to give you the wedding of your dreams. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. What's your escape route going to be this time? Not funny. I'm serious. I know, train, right? It's going to take place at the train station. You are so funny that I forgot to laugh. Mm. You want to come in and have some coffee? What, with her? Come on, are you kidding? 1966 Beaumont Convertible. Yeah... [Oscar]: Do you think that's your grandfather's car? Black... white interior. VIN number? -Hang on. -Uh-huh. 7311. This is it... this is it! [laughing] Going up for auction in 10 days. I can't believe it! When did this come out? This morning. I thought it looked like the same one. You don't get that color combo very often, so I came over. This is incredible. I've been looking for this for five years. I... I mean, what are the chances? Thank you, Oscar, thank you! Oh, ho, ho. Wow. Man, I sure wish my grandfather could see it. Well, it's something you can pass down to your grandchildren. Yeah. That's starting to look less and less likely these days. She's trying, you know. Hasn't really been herself. Yeah. Sometimes, I hardly recognize her. Look, I know she's let you down, but I'm really hoping you can give her another chance. A third. She really does mean it. Truth is, Oscar... I don't think I could ever actually say no to her... Yeah. But I have to admit, it's kind of nice seeing her work for it, you know? Why not let her sweat it out a bit? Oh... yeah, she's sweating. Good. Good luck with that car. Thank you! Thank you. Hey! I'll take you for the first spin. And I'll look forward to it. So I heard that the wedding is back on. That's the plan. Well, third time's a charm. You know, it really is meant to be a sacred institution, not to be entered into lightly. I guess that's why it wasn't. Well, not too many people trust their feelings up to the last minute... or last second, in your case. I thought I was being a coward. No. Cowardice would be getting married when you weren't ready to embrace what it really means to be husband and wife. I'll take it... but listen, it's very important that it happens at the church. It's James' church, and he really wants to have the wedding here. Well, there is a luncheon scheduled for the day that you requested. I could have it moved if you're certain. Yes. Absolutely certain. Oh, my gosh, thank you. Thank you so much. It's really going to mean the world to him. And you. And me. Right. Yes. But remember, Charlotte, commitment starts with getting through the entire ceremony... and God will be watching, and judging... again. Roseanne's Wedding Cakes... should be right about... [Nicole]: Charlotte! Oh, hi. Hi. What are you doing? Uh, just... shopping, and.... you too? Oh, it's just a little something I picked up for James. I just want to help him spruce up a little. Think of it as a favor to you. I like the way he's spruced. Most men just don't get their full potential. Have you ever seen him dressed in anything other than a pair of jeans and boots? Uh... no. There you go... and you, my friend, might be on the cover of my magazine. I'll take you shopping, too. So, your big moment's coming up. The tasting, I mean, not your wedding. How's your new creation coming along? Just... great. Great! Well, I should get going. Ta-ta! Oh. Now she's dressing him. Says she wants to spruce him up. Oh, and here's the kicker-- she says she's doing it for me as some sort of favor. Sure that's not too much vanilla? Then she said she's going to take me shopping. I mean, come on, do I need sprucing? You're fully spruced. [Nicole clearing throat] Hi. It's me. Hi. I got you a little something. For me? Yes, for you. Okay... uh... let's see what we got. Clothes. You like? They're, uh... They're nice. They're... classy. Well, I think you deserve classy. Why did you buy me clothes? I was out, and I saw them, and I figured I would surprise you. Maybe we can have that dinner... a dress-up dinner. We've hardly had a chance to catch up. Not tonight. Well, what about tomorrow? Well, let's talk tomorrow... but thank you very much. I haven't bought myself new clothes in a long time. You're very welcome. Do you have time to have a quick tea? Yeah, sure. Uh, quick tea. One quick tea. Let me run these upstairs, and I will be right back. Hmm... "Chocolate connoisseur!" "The sommelier of confectionary!" I mean, who does she think she is, and why is she judging me? Try and keep your eye on the prize, all right? The pen really is mightier than the sword, so wait until after the tasting's over, after she loves your new flavor and names you the winner, then let her know what you really think. You know what? I bet she's going to try and take him out to the most expensive dinner that she can possibly afford, and then she's going to impress him with all of her world travel and celebrity hob-nobbing, flatter him with all the things that they have in common. That won't impress James. Yeah, well, most men don't know their full potential. Listen, just go see him and tell him why you're the one. No, I have. Then tell him again. He needs to keep hearing it until he knows your full potential. Yeah, but what am I supposed to say? I mean, I've already said my car is making every single noise in the whole wide world. We still need his guest list. That's a valid reason. Guest list... Mm-hmm. She really is, like, an artist. I mean... you should put that in your magazine. Well, she hasn't won the competition yet. Wait until you try her chocolate. You don't even like chocolate. Then just ask anyone. They come from all over. How are you not furious at her? She left you at the altar. Most girls don't get the chance to say I do, much less I don't. It wasn't like that. James? [James]: What about you? I would have thought you would have gotten married. Oh, no. I never met the right man after you. I wasn't the right guy. I think you were... you just weren't Mr. Right Now. Mm. Story of my life. I wasn't ready. Story of my life. I think about it, though. Think about what? My wedding that never was, my dream wedding. I mean, what girl doesn't? I'm sorry, it's probably not a good subject with what you've been through. No, no. No, it's fine. I want to hear about it, please. You're going to think I'm silly. Try me. All right. I want to serve... popcorn and funnel cakes at the reception. Are you serious? I just told you. No, that's just... it's ironic... because that's my plan. Come on! Yeah. I mean, who would have thought? [Nicole]: Well, I want there to be traditional wedding things as well. Flowers... but I don't like roses. Peonies. Come on. What color? [Nicole]: Light-pink. [James]: Yeah, that's... weird. Oh, I have a whole list. I mean, how is it even possible? She wants carnival food at her wedding, too, and light-pink peony is her favorite flower? Just a coincidence? Yeah, but what if it isn't? What if they're meant to be? Don't say that. You should have heard them, Hannah. Okay. Moment of truth. All right. Wow. Yeah? Yeah, unreal. I love the hint of strawberry. What? No, no hint. Yeah, definitely a hint. Oh, my gosh, I must've mixed it in. I got distracted! I can't... she's allergic. She got under your skin. It happens. Yeah, well, that's exactly what's going to happen if she eats that batch. It's going to get under her skin. Her throat's going to get all prickly. I'm just going to have to create a whole other batch. Everything is going wrong. I don't know, Hannah... I give up. No. Just a few hiccups. You make a new batch. In the meantime, we have a wedding to plan, and you're not giving up on that either. -But... -No buts. The last thing on our checklist is the invites, right? Which I didn't even get from him last night. Okay. You go concentrate on the chocolate. I'll go to get the list. Hey... we're a team, right? Yep. We got this. [Hannah]: Hello? James? Whoa. Do I look stupid? You look amazing. I feel... constrained. I wouldn't change a thing. What's the occasion? Uh... I have an appointment. An appointment? Mm-hmm. Honey, an appointment is when you go to the doctor. You're dressed to impress. Well, that too, and I'm late. What's up? Charlotte asked if I could get the guest list from you. The guest list? We're sending out the invites. I told her nobody's going to fall for that again. The wedding's on. They'll be there, and so will she. Okay. Well, look, it's in here somewhere. I'm really late. I've got to run. Feel free to have a look. For your "appointment." Yeah. What? Nothing. Nothing! Light-pink peonies? A list? Everything you overheard Nicole say she liked. She obviously saw this before she told him any of that. So she was playing him. Yeah, and she still is. He looks all dressed up, on his way to an "appointment." An appointment? I bet. Exactly. You better figure out a way to stall him. He's dressed to kill, trust me. Well, where is this so-called appointment? I didn't ask. Never mind. I have an idea. Yep. [phone ringing] Hello, Charlotte. Hey, James. Uh, listen, I am so sorry to bother you, but I'm stuck on the side of the road, and every service station I called said they can't send anybody for an hour. What's wrong? My car just... died. So... could you come and take a look at it? I'm on my way somewhere, and I'm already running late. You know me, I probably just turned the wrong knob or something. Pretty please? Cherry on top? Where are you? Ooh... look at you, looking all snazzy. Yeah, do you like it? Looks okay. It's growing on me. I bet it is. What did your car do before it quit? I don't know, it just sort of... stopped. Well, look, your cap wires are loose. Not sure how they could have just fallen off like that. Okay, there. Go ahead and try and start it. What are you doing? Big hurry, huh? I bet. Yeah, and I'm already running late. What are you...? My keys are in there! Oh, are they? Sorry. What's wrong with you? What, yours is locked, too? I have to be there in 15 minutes! Whoops. I'm never going to make it in time now! Oh, yeah, and I bet it's real important. Looking all snap. The new James Cooper. She's got you all bundled up and packaged just the way she likes it, huh? What are you talking about? Please. Don't worry, she'll get over it. You think... you think this is for her? Ah, yeah. Charlotte, I was on my way to the auction, to bid on my grandfather's car. Say what? Oscar found it, the one I've been looking for for the past five years? The one he restored himself. The one I've been waiting for to come back onto the market. It did, okay, and the auction's today. Oh, crud. Is there still time? It was sold 10 minutes ago. All right. Who's the numbskull who locked the keys in both cars? Hello, Oscar. Good afternoon, Ms. Sweeney. Is Charlotte here? She's out. What can I do for you? Well, I'm just making sure everything's on track for Saturday. There's going to be a lot of press, and, well, I just want to make sure she doesn't leave me at the altar. Ah, yes. Ooh... is this it? No, she's still blending the final mix. It's not quite right yet. But it'll be ready for Saturday? Oh, yes. And it's going to be terrific, isn't it? If you're fair, it'll be the most amazing thing you've ever consumed. Well, this is the new concept wrapping she showed me for her new chocolate. It is. I'm dying for a taste. Well, if you eat that one, you'll wish you were. Were what? Dying. Why, what's wrong with it? Charlotte mentioned you get a reaction to strawberries. Oh. Oh, yes. Thank you. Well... let Charlotte know that I'm going to call her with details. Of course. Why wouldn't I be fair? Because nothing's ever fair in love and chocolate... is it? Thank you, Oscar. You're welcome. [Hannah]: That is bad. I don't think he's ever going to speak to me again. I wouldn't if I was him. Thank you. It's my fault... bad intel. No, look, it's mine. I'm the one who's acting stupid. It's just her. I don't ever want to see her face again. [phone ringing] [Hannah]: Now, that's funny. Isn't it, though? Nicole! Charlotte! Nicole. I want to apologize. For what? Okay, I admit I have been... trying to win James over... but business is business. Oscar said your new flavor will be ready for the tasting on Saturday. Yes, it's really close. I respect that. What do you say we shelve our current competition and focus on the one that matters most at the moment. For how long? Until after the competition. Truce? Truce. Agreed. Agreed. What? A momentary armistice. How diplomatic. Right? Good? It's the one. Mm... Absolutely magical. Talk to me. Oh, it's nothing. It's just... I made this for him, too. Thought maybe he'd finally like chocolate. Engine trouble? Listen, I know you're mad at me... but I'd really like you to come tomorrow. Never been a big fan of chocolate. You know that. I think you'll like this one. I made it for people like you, people I'm... trying to win over. Hey, Charlotte. Hey, Jimmy. No slacking off! Really? It honestly wasn't planned. I literally just bumped into her. Yeah, right. That's a violation of our terms! We never defined our terms. Uh, what terms are we... Nothing. Listen, just come tomorrow. Biggest day of my life, and it won't mean anything if you're not there. You do know the irony of what you just said, right? Sorry. I'll think about it. It's a large crowd, eagerly anticipating the moment that Charlotte unveils her new, secret flavor, and none other than Nicole Sweeney, founder and editor in chief of Chocolate Monthly and one of the world's leading chocolate connoisseurs, has been touring the country to name America's best chocolate, shall be the first to taste this new creation. It's not just the most original and best-tasting chocolate that will win the award and be on the cover of my magazine, but it's also the story behind the chocolate that's very important. Who is Charlotte Bennett? What drives her? What itch does she like to scratch? [reporter]: Hold that thought. Here she comes now. Bon appetit. Are you ready for your big moment, Charlotte? I am, Nicole. And you're confident that this is the best you have to offer? [Charlotte]: Never more so in my life. That's a lot to live up to for a woman of your reputation. Well, I've made a lot of mistakes in the past, Nicole, but I believe the key to making a great chocolate is learning from those mistakes and being true to yourself. Only then is what you have to offer authentic. I believe that's a word you use a lot in your reviews. It is-- but being authentic is a high bar. I agree. Most people don't know what it means to be authentic. Genuine. Not copied or false. Relating to or denoting an emotionally appropriate, significant, purposive, responsible mode of human life. Adjective. So, your new flavor is called "S.J."? What does this mean? It's personal. Hmm. Very clever. Add a shroud of mystery and create a buzz all of its own. [chocolate drops] Oh! Sorry. [clearing throat] [coughing] [coughing] My throat... it's all prickly. I'm allergic to strawberries! There's strawberry in this! No! I told you I was allergic to strawberry. I can taste strawberry in this! No, I would never do that! [coughing] Jimmy, let's go. Jimmy... I need water! I need water. No, I... James! What? She's going to write a review so bad, no one will ever buy my chocolate again. James will never marry me. It's over. Oh, this will pass. There's more chocolate to be made. Just... how could this happen? There were no strawberries. Perhaps one dash too many of something else. Back to the drawing board, but first... I want to show you something that's going to cheer you up. Come on. Come on! There... there we go. Keep them closed. Okay, keep them closed. Oh, okay. Here we go. Keep them closed. Over here, keep them closed... and one more... step a little bit. There we go, and... open them! It's his grandfather's car! Oscar, how did you... Well, I contacted the auction house, and they forwarded my information to the buyer. He got ahold of me right away after he heard the situation. Lives a few miles from here. What, really? Yeah. Turns out... the man has a weakness for your chocolate. I threw in an extra gift by offering chocolate for life. Bargain, if you ask me. Yeah, it's a... it's an amazing bargain. Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome. Wow. Go call him. Uh, no. I think James has probably had enough of me. I'll just have someone bring it to his garage. You know, I really thought he was going to like chocolate this time. Wait a minute. Hey. Who cleared the table? I did. Why? Where's the wrapper from the piece of chocolate that Nicole ate? Oh, it's right over here. Perfect. [Hannah]: What are you doing? What? Okay, look. This is the strawberry batch, right? The one I mixed the other day. I got distracted, I made a mix, but I shoved it, right? There's one missing. Okay, look. It's a blank wrapper, but the new ones all had S.J. engraved on them. You must have accidentally mixed them up. No! No, no, no, somehow, she... she did it on purpose. How would she even get it? We're the only ones that even knew these other ones existed. Mm... not exactly true. So, you feeling any better? A little bit. I'm still so humiliated. Well, I mean, it was obviously a mistake. A mistake? She did it on purpose. I could tell by the way she was looking at me when I ate the thing, there was something up with her. No, why would she sabotage the biggest moment of her life? Well, I think it's pretty obvious. She knows that the two of you are over, and she knows the reason why. Charlotte? When did you steal it, Nicole? Steal what? The piece of chocolate with the strawberry in it. Ah-hah! So you admit it. No. Look, the only thing I admit is that I got distracted one day, and I added some strawberry to a mixture that I never intended for you, but I put it in the back, and... look, somehow, she took a piece. She found one, and she took a piece. Look, this... Look. Okay, this is just a generic wrapper. The one I gave you had S.J. embossed on the wrapper. You switched them! Oh, my goodness, you're losing your mind. You really think that I would purposefully give myself a severe allergic reaction? When you dropped it on the floor, that's when you made the switch. I can't believe that you went through all of that just to make me look like a horrible person in front of James. The real one's still in your purse, isn't it? Charlotte, just... No, tell her to empty her purse. I'll do no such thing. James, can we just leave, please? No, just-- empty your purse. No! Give it back! [James]: Charlotte, wait. I'm... Sorry. -Let me help. -No. No. Do not touch anything. I'm so sorry. James... -I love you. -[James]: Charlotte, please. [Charlotte]: I'm going to go. Okay? I am. Just let me say this, okay, and then I'm gone. Okay. She doesn't know you the way that I do, and she doesn't know how you brush my hair out of my face, and you'd find ridiculous reasons to fix my car, but it's really just because you want to see me. You were always so selfless, and you made me feel so loved and so special and important and so lucky that I had someone like you in my life when I needed you. I love you, and I want to be your wife, and everything is ready, and I am going to be there. Do you think he's actually going to be there after everything you've done? I do. I'm sorry. Can we go? Ma'am? This was under one of the tables. It came out when you, um, dropped your purse. You did switch them? Been looking for you since last night. You weren't home. I spent the night at Hannah's. Kind of thought I might find you here, since this is where you always used to come after we had a fight. We also almost got married here once, if you remember. Yeah. You deserve so much better, James. Oh... what's better? Well, for one, someone who doesn't leave you at the altar... twice. Yeah, I guess that's the least one could ask for. The Charlotte Bennett who was going to marry me two years ago wasn't ready to be married, but I made her feel like she was supposed to be... and the Charlotte Bennett who was supposed to marry me a year ago was trying to make up for what she did the year before that. This year's Charlotte Bennett, however... now, that's complicated. Involving many different and confusing aspects. Adjective. Well, now, see, I had to look it up. I don't have your gift, but there's more than one definition. Consisting of many interconnecting parts or elements; intricate. Means the same thing. Not to me. You see, "intricate" is kind of a nice way to describe you. "Many fine parts." And I think that the many fine parts that make up this Charlotte Bennett is ready to get married. Why would James Cooper still want to marry me? Because you like how I brush the hair out of your eyes... and how I come up with reasons to fix your car or your delivery truck when they're perfectly fine... and you know that you make me feel so loved, and important, and smart. Even after I broke your heart? You didn't break my heart. You're what keeps it beating. Try it. I'm not big on chocolate. Yeah, I know. It's different this time. Just try it. What does S.J. stand for? Sweet James. [laughing] Okay. Okay. Oh, my goodness. You like it? This isn't chocolate. This is an out of body experience. Oh, you shouldn't eat that! Mm... Nothing. How long does it take before you...? No, it's immediate. Nothing. I'm back to me! That's good... because... you still have a wedding to plan. ♪ You are the love of my life ♪ ♪ And I'm so glad you found me ♪ ♪ You are the love of my life ♪ ♪ Baby, put your arms around me ♪ ♪ Yeah, 'cause this is how it feels ♪ ♪ When you finally find something real ♪ ♪ My angel in the night ♪ You are my love ♪ The love of my life You look stunning. Are you ready to do this? I am. Look at you. Look at that. Sweet ride. Yeah. Any idea how this happened? Karma? They say a little rain on your wedding day is good luck, right? [laughing] Where's Charlotte? She'll be here any minute. Now, go on and take your place, go on. Hey, boys, looking good. Where the heck is she? All right, that's it. Ring. Uh... Where did you put the ring? You didn't give me the ring. You had it last. No! What? No, I... Oh, my gosh, I left it at work. Don't panic, I'll get it. I'll meet you at the church. Okay, okay, thanks. You can drive in that? I can do anything today. This is amazing. Best day ever. [rattling] No... No, no, no. Come on, that's right. You've got it, yeah. No... uh... Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't... don't, don't even... Oh, my gosh. Okay. Where's my phone? Where's my phone? It's in my purse... which is in my house. This isn't happening. Okay. Oh... Ugh, what did I do to deserve this? Never mind. Okay, what would James do? Um... Yes! Okay. Oh, come on. [engine sputtering] Please! Got it. Got what? The ring. Charlotte left it at the office. Where's the bride? I thought she was with you. Uh... Oh! Yes! Hey! Okay... Okay. I don't know. Ah... Yes! Thank you. You didn't. No. No, my car broke down... for real this time. Charlotte... Get in. Thank you. Oh! Thank you so much! Okay, it's just... it's just... just drive. I don't know, Hannah. Just tell her I went home, okay? I can't do this anymore. [James]: Hi. Hi! -You good? -Yeah. Yeah? Well, let's get married. -Thank you. -You're welcome. [pastor]: Let's begin. Do you, James Cooper, take Charlotte to be your wife? I do. [pastor]: Do you, Charlotte Bennett, take James to be your husband? I... do. [laughing] You may exchange the rings. [pastor]: You may now kiss as husband and wife.
