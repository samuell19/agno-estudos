Let me help you. Um. Thank you. I'm Kat Malone, music scout. I loved your set, why don't you and I grab a seat and talk management? We've got a manager. Who, who's your manager? Me. Right, I am, I'm so sorry about the drinks, my bad, I'll pay you back. What's your number? No need. There is, I loved your songs, and I really think... Look, just don't go stealing drinks off musicians, all right? There's enough people in this business trying to rip you off, it's tough. That's because you're playing the wrong places. Your bass is too dominant. Your social media is social suicide, and your set list, confused. Anything else? Yes, you have a sound that's so raw. It's so heartfelt and...

But, she's super shy. [Marcus] Yeah, she's super cute. So, basically she just needs a few drinks and then she relaxes and will talk and stuff. To you. Okay. So? Is there an afterparty we should know about, or something? Let me take your number, and I'll text you. What did you say? Nothing. He just randomly gave me the address to a very cool afterparty. No. And we're going. No, seriously, Kat, tomorrow is... Another boring day, like every other boring day. Tonight, it begins. The future, Dollar Days, they need our help. It's what we've always talked about doing, since forever. I'm sorry, I can't. He likes you. He'll be at the party. He's fit, you said he was. I suppose, for a short while. [upbeat rock music] Just pretend you belong. [upbeat rock music] [guests chattering] Use your gifts. What? Thank you. [upbeat rock music] Excuse me. Mm, yeah, yeah, I know. I know, right? Yeah, totally. I love Matthew McConaughey too. Hey, happy you're happy, that's what I'm good at. Speak later. Oh, hi. You get around. I... Oh right, yeah, the free drinks, yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, very funny, you're funny. Cool. It's a shame you don't show that side of your personality onstage. What? Oh, I'm just saying you could show a bit more personality, a sense of humor when performing. I totally have a sense of humor. I know, I just told you that. No, I just told you that. [chuckles] Look, what it is that you want? I don't want anything. Well then you're clearly not a manager, are you? I mean, you all want something. Whether it's an extra cut, push us in a direction that we don't actually wanna go in, dilute the music, steal the girlfriend. No. I do not want to steal your girlfriend. That's good to know. I'm glad you don't wanna sell out, because I'm only interested in managing authentic artists. Kat Malone, ha ha. Good luck, because she's the shit [laughs]. [Woman] Kat. You're in demand. I know a lot of people. [Alex] He'll cool down by tomorrow. That's if he makes it to rehearsal. I'll get a drink then. How about I come along? I'd love to hear more of your songs, and then we can take it from there. Just give me your number, and I'll text you. [upbeat rock music] Later. Jane, let's go. Can you play me... It's not up to me, babe. I don't play the songs. This one plays me. Ugh. Was this is a dream? No, the dream is just beginning. [upbeat rock music] [vocalizing] [upbeat rock music] Pulled an all-nighter [laughs]. [upbeat rock music and vocalizing] Got dressed in the dark, did you? I would, with a face like that. Sure scared of catching yourself in the mirror, aren't you, Kat? Frog Face. [throat clearing] [speaking foreign language] [phone ringing] [Kat] Yeah? Hi, Kat, it's Alex. Alex from the band. Yes, yes, how are you? [Alex] Good. I've been thinking about what we talked about, you coming down to rehearsal. Kat Malone! Alex, I've got a situation here, crazy client. Can we talk later? Yeah, sure, all right. [phone beeping] Mr. Cato? You know the rules. You can pick this up at the end of the day. I do know the rules, sir, and you know, in the all years I've stared at you, bored out of my brains in music class, I have never seen you in such a remarkably well fitted or well coordinated outfit as you're wearing today. It was supposed to be a secret. What was? The music concert that I'm organizing, right now. There's so much to be done. It's for exam results day. I thought it would be empowering to celebrate such a momentous day with the ancient tradition of music, which historically has been used in various rights-of-passage ceremonies. What do you want out of this school, Kat? I mean, you're obviously bright, you're talented, you can talk the hind legs off a... Monkey? I think it's a monkey. Or is it a donkey? But when it comes to focus, you don't have it. You're all over the place. I'm focused. I'm focused right now on this concert. I am, Joy, Rose, you're performing in my exam results concert, right?

Why do I need to sit exams? I don't even want to go to uni. Organelles and cell theory is not exactly everyday conversation in the music industry. Have you got cystitis? No. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I know, and if I had it then I wouldn't be. But, I don't. I had terrible cystitis in the '60s, all those tight-fitting hot pants. I just like the taste. There was no circulation down there. It's really fruity. I started to wear skirts commando style. It sorted it. I bet Bowie never had a yellow warning ruining his life. See this? This is your yellow warning. [chuckling] Gone, no longer exists. That's how Bowie would have dealt with it. He chose his own reality, his own fluid identity. You need to do the same. Don't let other people's sense of reality dictate yours. In Kat's dictionary of life, it's only you who can write its definition. Gran, I swear I'm not gonna let anyone stop me from... Kat, get up here now! No, I don't think you do understand, Kat, because if you did, you wouldn't behave in such a cavalier fashion. A yellow warning, that, that's only three steps away from suspension. That's the dream. Oh, it's not funny. Oh, it's a little bit funny. How was your Spanish oral? [speaking foreign language] You know I don't speak Spanish. [speaking foreign language] Do you understand why I work my ass off to send you to the best private school I can afford? Because when I went to school... None of the teachers cared. They didn't. And we certainly weren't taught extras like Spanish or music or drama, because what was the point? We were only gonna get knocked up or work down the pound store. You didn't get knocked up. My point is, I knew that I would prove them wrong and make something of life. Living the dream. All I'm asking of you, Kat, is to take these exams seriously. They're going to be used as your predictive grades, so if you don't, you have no chance of an offer from any decent university. But that's not really what I want. This is New York, sh. Hello, Liz Malone speaking. Hello, Liz Malone speaking. Hi, Brigitte, how are you? Hi, Brigitte, how are you? Hasn't the fashion buyer got back to us yet? [light upbeat music] [vocalizing] I'm off to revise with Jane. Oh good, send her my love. And call me if you're going to be late. Do you think a regular residency at a single venue would achieve better momentum than scattered gigs across town? I think the aorta carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body tissues and the pulmonary artery carries blood to the lungs to pick up a fresh supply of oxygen. I don't know, do you have to decide now? I'm meeting them tonight. Tonight? How are you going to revise? I'm not. You have to. I don't care about exams. For real? Yeah, for real. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I can't mess it up, this is our future. I need to have a plan in place to convince Alex that I can push the band past that sticky first base. I have the answer. This, is a sure thing. It'll definitely get you past first base, banging to all that stickiness. Firstly, you're gross. And secondly, my interest in Alex is purely professional. Good, don't ever make my mistake of following your heart instead of your head. Look what it got me. Here? With us? It was summer 1978. Eucalyptus blossoms stung your nostrils like hungry bees. Casablanca was a dust bowl. You could hardly move for the heat. But the earth moved when I saw her, this girl. Long, yellow dress. Hair shining as intensely as the sun. Lips like, ah, well, that was it. She was on her way to London. I was on my way to heartbreak hell, via Gatwick. And what did I end up with? Not the girl. Not the sunshine. A kabob plan. [laughing] Schupa? [phone ringing] KLT Management, Kat speaking. Hey, Kat, this is Alex. Alex, hi, sorry I didn't get back to you earlier. Hectic day in the office. That's okay, I know you're busy. Look, I wanted to cancel you coming down to rehearsal tonight. Really? There's no point. Why? Our drummer's just walked out and joined our ex-manager's new band. Anyway, best of luck with everything and... Hang on. I might be able to help. I know this amazing drummer. [Alex] That's okay, we'll advertise. Yes, you should. But why don't you listen to him first? Alex? Okay, bring him down. We'll be there from seven. Great. Later. See ya. A drummer? [upbeat rock music] Awesome. That's a real band. [upbeat rock music] [Kat] Hey, that sounded great. Oh, Brian, this is Kat. [Kat] Malone. She brought the drummer. Sid. Hi. Nice riff, Brian. Yeah, I think it brings the chorus back from being too... Early '80s synth pop? Yeah. Yeah. Is something funny? No, he's just happy to be here. So where have you played? Brixton. Oh, the academy? The Tube station. Sorry, I have a small window here. Can we get on with the playing? Sid, just come in when you can, yeah? [Sid] Yeah. [upbeat rock music] - That's nice work. - Thanks, man. So, what you reckon? Do you mind if we take a minute? [Sid] Sure. He's the real thing. And a sweet guy. I think we should try him out for a couple of weeks. Great. Cool, well, thanks for coming. I think now would be the perfect time to talk management. I have a vision for you, your band, and I've written some stuff up. Number one, you need a regular residency. This builds up a fan base who become familiar with your songs. Number two. It's here, all in here. Touring is key, I would contact the right promoters to get you booked into the most credible venues, building momentum so that when we come back to London we can book a really great gig. Cool, yeah, I mean, the Stones were all about touring. And Janis Joplin, have you ever seen her performance at Woodstock? Yeah, it's so personal it feels like you shouldn't actually be listening to it. Yeah, I know, right? That's how it should be. That's why I got into this in the first place. People who love music sharing their music, why else do it? It's like, it's like you always remember where you were when you first heard a really great song. And who you were with. Anyway, Sid's great. How about you give me an eight-week trial? See what I can deliver? Look, managers... Six weeks. Come on, what have you got to lose? ♪ Praying hands, open hearts ♪ Yeah, yeah.

[dog barking] [knocking on door] Busy? Yes, so much to do. Finally, that's what I've been trying to tell you for the last eight weeks. Well you've hardly been around for the last eight weeks. I might not be here, but I'm across everything you're up to. You don't know anything. What I do know is Mr. Cato's holding afterschool revision on Thursday, and I've signed you up. Without even asking me? I'm not going. You will go, and I will check up on you. I've got work to do. Good. [phone ringing] [students chattering] Kat Malone speaking.

It's the Number One venue in Snowshill. Is that on the Tube. The Cotswolds, very pretty. Oh. Oh. What do you think?

And the next gig, how's that going? Yeah, I'm talking to some venues. Good, that's we're all about, live gigs. Always have been. There is this one venue. It's cool, but it's in the Cotswolds, and my bands normally only play it as part of a west country tour. Hmm. What did you think? Well we did talk about touring last summer. Sid? Yeah. I could do with some spiritual reenergizing. We could play at Stonehenge. I, I don't think that's a venue. Yeah, we could meet our virtual fans. Like the spirits and the ghosts. I think it's a great idea. Reach out to a fan base outside of London. Yeah, if we have one. Agreed? All right, let's do it. Oh. Do you think that Bowie ever just wanted to not put on the warpaint and disappear under a duvet? If he was human. I've read a very convincing theory that he wasn't. Yes. Oh, what's the matter, Kitty Kat? Everything. Exams. Jane, she's behaving so weird lately. I mean, just because you fancy a boy doesn't mean you have to change your entire personality. I mean, she loves the Slits as much as I do. Don't worry, you girls will be friends for life. Boys come and go. But, always, Jane will be there for you. How's it going with the band? Okay. Have you slept with any of them yet? No. Free love is a beautiful thing. The band want to go on tour. And, well, I don't know how I can do that. What's stopping you? Going away, booking gigs, school, mum, it's impossible. Isn't it your dream? Then you don't have a choice. [door opening] Ugh, there's not nothing in here. There's yogurt, Parma ham. There's coriander hummus. Ugh, who likes that? Most people. But I'm not most people! I'm an individual, why doesn't anyone understand that? I have my own ideas and thoughts and dreams, and funny enough, they don't involve listening to talent show bands or sleeping with members of the band or eating coriander hummus. Well, that's fine, I'm not telling you to do any of those things. You're always telling me what to do. I'm asking you to focus on your exams. So important for you. No, it's important for you! I couldn't give a shit. You want me to do well so you can show me off, Kat Malone, best in show, why don't you just put me on a leash and be done with it? And then you can swan around at work and tell anyone what an amazing mother you are, well, you're not. [birds chirping] If you're serious about these ideas, then let's do something about it. Bullet point it, figure out how you're going to achieve it. You don't understand. I do. Think about it. Do you want me to look over them in the morning? [upbeat music and clapping] Mum? Some work problems. She had to catch an early flight to New York. She'll be a few weeks. She didn't want to wake you, darling. [upbeat music] We're going on tour. I'm taking the band on tour, Gran. Adios, exams, two whole weeks away from this dump! Far away. It's all set, we're leaving on Sunday. It will be amazing. You don't mind sharing a room, do you? Save a bit of money. Do you believe it, we're taking a band on tour? I can't go. Why not? I've made other plans. Like what? See you tonight, and make sure you bring Marcus. [girls chattering] I just want to spend some time with him. But he's, he's everything we've always hated. He's an Ab Zombie. He's successful! Look, we had a lot of fun, but it was always just a dream. We can't really do it, not for real. We can. If you get caught out, it'll be a disaster. It won't, you and Marcus, that's the disaster. Thanks for your support. You are not supporting me. Not everything always is about you. Or Dollar Days or Alex. I have a life, and I'm fed with having to constantly pretend to be someone I'm not!

Sorry? Well, normally, but she's not here. And where is here? Good question, I think we're at... Hello. He was a bit drunk. Yeah, I knew it, you're out drinking, aren't you? Yes. Yes, I'm sorry, Mum. I want you straight home, check in on Gran and then up to bed and we'll talk about this when I return. She's not delivered. We should fire her. But maybe she's got something amazing up her sleeve. It's possible. Why don't we just ask her? See if she's got anything else booked. You're listening to him now? He's been here, what, five minutes? We were doing fine as we were. Okay. How about we just give her another week? Can't you just do something productive with your holidays? There's a short course running at the tech. No. No, listen, listen. It's for young entrepreneurs. I thought after our chat it might be of interest. You know, that does sound quite interesting. Well do you want me to book it? I'll do it. Do you have your credit card details? Of course, I'm glad you're so keen. I am. It means everything to me. It just needs powder. Oh, and you should see the hotel I've booked. It looks awesome, I want you guys to get a good night's sleep, busy days ahead. Where? Where are we being busy? I've got some interesting potential venues. Like what? Scala. That's great. What is it? The ultimate mass music event. And it's being livestreamed. Who's playing? All the most credible emerging artists. It's a great showcase. Cool. See? I know what I'm doing, guys. No! Ugh. He took our clothes. I thought there was no crime in the Cotswolds. We can, we can buy new clothes. [Alex] You can buy them. That's what I mean. I can buy new clothes. In fact, before our next gig, I wanted to talk to you guys about your style, as a band. It's, it's, um. You need a fresh look. Trust me! [upbeat music] The Georgian Dragon. I breathe it. I become it. [upbeat music] Shall we start unloading the van? You done good. ♪ Oh oh, oh oh oh ♪ Can I help you? I'm Kat Malone, manager of the band. Didn't expect you to turn up. What's the problem? The credit card details you gave us for the deposit. Yes? The bank's investigating. It believes the card has been cloned. The owner, the real owner, has been contacted. [soft music] First name George, surname Andragon. Because I am the George and Dragon. There's been a mixup. We're not playing tonight. A mixup? But I checked their webpage, we're playing. We're not. What kinda mixup, yours? 28th of October, Dollar Days, canceled. I'm sorry, guys, I'm so sorry. We're still playing Scala. Are we? Well. Don't bullshit, I checked the website and we're not even on it. [soft music] [crying] I put myself on the line for you! The guys, they trust me. I'm trying to keep this band together. It's a huge responsibility. I know. Do you? Brian wanted to fire you, and it's me who pushed for you to stay. I believed in you. Was that a mistake? I, I don't know. You have to know. You need to really really want this, it's hard. That's why people take the easy route with the talent shows and not playing live. That's not who we are, is it? I don't always know exactly who I am. You're our manager. But managers who get too close are managers who get fired. What do you mean? Our last manager, we worked together, hung out, we wanted the same things, just a bit too much. How can it be too much? Surely that's a good thing. Um, he wanted my girlfriend, so he took her. Now they're together. Come on, let's get a drink. I'll see if I can buy you some time, but they ain't happy. You've gotta sort something fast, all right? [soft music] Yeah, the response has been solid. The audiences love them. Great. [Kat] How's it going with Marcus? So good, they're playing a gig at Scala tomorrow. Cool. Yeah, the band are playing a gig right now. Awesome. Yeah, sorry. [glass breaking] It's probably a bit noisy. Shame you're not here. I could have got you in tomorrow. Marcus always wants me at his gigs. Kat, I... [Kat] Yes? I'll see you back at school. Yeah, see you then. [soft music] [crying] We need to talk. Come on, get up. Can you stop doing whatever it is you're doing for like one minute? You wanna fire me? Get on with it, just fire me. Hey. Why would I wanna do that? [sobbing] I mean, I've made some pretty dumb decisions in the past, but even I wouldn't fire the girl whose relentless, headstrong, unappreciated hard work has just got our band one million hits. What? The video you posted, Journey from A to B. Badly Drawn Boy has just put it up on his Twitter page, saying, check this out, it's fresh. We've gone viral! [laughing] [upbeat music] I'm sure you do want them to play, but I'm weighing up options and I can't commit until I speak to them personally. Look, I have my own shit to deal with. Yes, but they are asleep in the hotel at the moment, so... I will get back to you as soon as they're up. [upbeat music] [door opening] Coffee anyone? [Brian] Go away. No? Okay. Scala anyone? [upbeat music] Us? And Badly Drawn Boy, he wants you as his support act! [cheering] [laughing] [upbeat music] [traffic passing] Need anything? What are you listening to? It's 1958, the Beatles' first-ever recording. In Spite of All the Danger. Written by McCartney and Harrison when they were only 15. Now listen to this. It's 1963, it's five years later. They now have Ringo, and Lennon's just written Please Please Me. Ah, wow. Allan Williams was their first manager. He heard them play, but he didn't listen, not like really listen, he didn't see what they could be. Brian Epstein, he could. He had this, like, sixth sense. Mm, the potential. The potential. Everyone's good at something, it's just most people don't get listened to. Not hard enough. [phone buzzing] When Epstein died, do you know what Paul McCartney said? If ever there were a fifth member of the Beatles, it was Mr. Epstein. That's cool. Very cool. Very, very, very cool. [laughing] [upbeat music] We're the second band on, so we should be all right. It's not far. Watch this, I'll get us there on time. Yeah, in time for last orders. If I'm driving so slow, why is the engine smoking. Yeah, right. No, seriously, it's really smoking. Oh dear. [crowd chattering] Sid! I thought you filled it up. I did. With what? Diesel. It's petrol, it runs on petrol. Oh. What are we gonna do now? I used to have a job at an ice cream van. I'll sort it, I will sort it. Mr. Freezy Tops definitely ran on diesel. Kat, we can't miss this. Grab the gear. We're gonna leg it. What about the drums? I'll come back for anything we can't carry. Come on! [upbeat music] [Girl] We're with Jane, we're supposed to go backstage. You don't have any tickets here. [Girl] This is a joke.

No problem. If there's anything else, there's my card. [people chattering] All right, guys. [crowd cheering and applauding] Hello, Scala! We're so happy to be here.

And now for someone who needs no introduction, please welcome Badly Drawn Boy! [crowd cheering and applauding] Hello, London. Mate, did you hear them shouting my name? They all loved you. There's always that one member of the band that breaks out to become the heartthrob. So I've got you an interview slot with BBC Radio London. You need to be at their studio by nine. Got it. Oh, and can you make sure Sid doesn't say anything strange? Too strange. You're not just enjoying this moment? I am. Just look at that. Oh my God, the numbers are going up. Sure, just a little bit. Who cares? I'm not the one with 758,000 people looking at pictures of me. Wow. Yes, wow. In fact, I'm gonna take a photo now, I need an update. Why are you smiling? Because I'm happy? No, I don't want happy. You look too approachable. Imagine you're thinking about organelles and cell theory. [shutter clicking] Much better. See, it's not enough to be good looking. You need to be mysterious. Do you think I'm good looking? You are in the room. I mean that if good looking is a room, then you're in it. The doorway. Definitely in the doorway, good looking. - Kat. - Jane. I heard the band play, they were amazing. Thanks for the backstage pass, Kat. Where's Marcus? You've made me look like a complete tit. I told all my friends on PinkChat I had a backstage pass. You are such a little virgin. Look, hi, could we get a selfie? Sure. Thanks. I knew she couldn't keep a hold of a fittie like him. Thanks, that's going straight on my story. Yeah, Jane, dumped because she's such a weez she wouldn't even... Back off, Frog Face! And you, you post one word and I will shove those crappy hair extensions of yours right up your ass. I thought Scala had an entrance policy, no weirdos. Do you guys know each other? We are not friends, we're at school together. She's in my class. A-level Spanish, that's all. School? Kat? You're a schoolgirl? And, and a manager. You've been lying to us, right from the start? You've been deliberately making a fool of us? It wasn't like that. Then what was it like? I thought in this industry of bullshit and dishonesty and ego, I'd finally found someone who is smart, genuine and funny. But you're just exactly the same. Actually, no no, actually, no, you're not. You're worse. Because you made me believe that somehow I wasn't the only one, that I wasn't alone in all of this. You're fake, Kat Malone. [soft music] [Kat] He's not responding to my texts. What did you write? I was reminding him about the radio interview. Maybe you should try something a bit more personal. So what happened with Marcus? It was fun to begin with. He made me feel, I don't know, like, really special. Then it got heavy. I should never have pushed you together. Don't be silly, it was our game. Somehow, it became real. And I couldn't be the girl he wanted. I just wasn't ready. I'm so sorry. I think you're the coolest girl I know. [soft music] I have an idea. What? When we get back, shall we go out one night and we can pretend to be just us? Okay. [phone ringing] Oh. Oh God, she's gonna kill me. She's back earlier, I think she knows it's me that's been spending zillions on her card. [phone ringing] You can face it. [phone ringing] Before you say anything, please show me mercy. You need to come home now. You know where I am? Gran's in hospital, she needs you. You've got to come home now. [traffic passing] [Radio Interviewer] So this evening, I'm really happy to have here in the studio, straight from performing with Badly Drawn Boy, Dollar Days. Hi, guys, welcome. - Hello. - How are you doing? [Radio Interviewer] So you've played Scala, where else can we expect to see you? [Alex] We're gonna be supporting the Risk Factor on tour. [Radio Interviewer] Is that an exclusive? [Alex] Yeah, it is. We've just been confirmed. We've known the guys for a while, and now that we share the same management, it makes sense. [Radio Interviewer] Great. Thanks for having us. They've dropped me. [soft music and vocalizing] I just wanted to bring her a few things, some personal things, the hospital room's so stark. What happened? She fell and then she lay there. By herself for over a day. Where were you? If I'd been here, none of this would have happened. Gran would have called, and I would have run down. She was here alone. And in pain. You need to start making better choices. Not for me, for you. Mum. I want to tell you where I've been. [crying] Sh. I'm here. [traffic passing] I'm sorry about your Gran. We're hoping she'll be out of hospital by the end of the week and we can look after her from home. [Faz] More hot water, pastries? I got it all wrong. I let everyone down, Gran, you, Mum, the band. Me? How am I supposed to get to the cash and carry on Thursday? I've got no van. Oh, I'm so sorry, Faz. I'll sort it. What can I do? Do what you're good at. Weren't you organizing some exam results concert? Uh, that'll be lame. All the acts, they're just schoolkids. Just schoolkids? [upbeat music] Okay. I suppose I shouldn't let them down. I'll do it. Thanks. [soft music and vocalizing] So, right now, who has my van? The band. You got Alex's number? I think it's time we got it back. [upbeat music] Oh. [Mr. Cato] Kat Malone. [Kat] Mr. Cato. What'd you get? Two D's and a C. The C was for music. You're so much brighter than that. Not to worry, let's figure out what went wrong and I'll organize a meeting with your other teachers and we'll turn those grades around. We've still got six months. [upbeat music] [door opening] [soft music and vocalizing] I'm looking for Mr. Faz. I'm here to return his van. He gave me this address. [soft music and vocalizing] Are you Mr. Faz? I've got his van. I am not Mr. Faz. Then tell me, exactly who are you? I am just a schoolgirl. But a schoolgirl who loves music more than anything in the whole world and who lied to you more than anyone has ever in the whole world, and I don't know how to make that right. Where would be if we hadn't have met you? We'd still be trundling along, playing the same circuit of clubs that we always had been. With our 412 followers. 372. 372 followers. Me pretending everything's all right. Everything's all right with the band, everything's all right with me. When it most definitely wasn't. You weren't the only one lying. Look at us now. We've got over a million followers, playing to crowds we could have never dreamt of. Sharing our music, and it's all real. And that's all because of you. You had something to do with it. We all did, all of us. We did it together. If anyone was a fourth member of the band, it was you. [laughing] A concert? Better get going.
