Announcer: live from the star-filled international ballroom of the Beverly Hilton hotel, welcome to the 2020 golden globe awards honoring the best in movies and television, including special awards to Tom Hanks and Ellen degeneres. Now your host for the evening, ladies and gentlemen, Ricky gervais [applause] Hello thank you. Thank you. Hello and welcome to the 77th annual golden globe awards, live from the Beverly Hilton hotel here in Los Angeles. I'm Ricky gervais. Thank you. You'll be pleased to know this is the last time I'm hosting these awards so I don't care anymore. I'm joking I never did. Nbc clearly don't care either, this time. So, I mean, Kevin hart was fired from the oscars because of some offensive tweets hello? Lucky for me, the Hollywood foreign press can barely speak english and they have no idea. So I got offered this gig by fax. Let's go out with a bang let's have a laugh at your expense, shall we? Remember, they're just jokes we're all going to die soon and there's no sequel. So, yeah remember that. You all look lovely, dolled up you came in your limos I came in a limo tonight and the license plate was Felicity huffman no, shush. It's her daughter I feel sorry for, okay? That must be the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to her. And her dad was in "wild hogs. So lots of big celebrities here tonight. I mean, legend, icons, yeah? This table alone al Pacino, Robert De Niro. [Applause] Baby Yoda. That's Joe pesci, sorry. I love you, man, don't have me whacked. But tonight isn't just about the people in front of the camera. In this room are some of the most important TV and film executives in the world, people from every background. But they all have one thing in common they're alter find of Ronan farrow he's coming for you. He's coming for you. Look, talking of all you pervert perverts, it was a big year, surviving r. Kelly, leaving never land, two popes. Shut up, shut up I don't care I don't care many talented people of color were snubbed in major categories unfortunately there's nothing we can do about that. The Hollywood foreign press are all very, very racist. So, fifth time we were going to do an in memoriam this year when I saw the list of people that died, it wasn't diverse enough, no it was mostly white people and I thought, no, not on my watch. Maybe next year. Let's see what happens no one cares about movies anymore, no one goes to cinema, no one watches network TV. Everyone's watching Netflix. This show should just be me coming out, you win everything, Netflix, good night. No, we drag it out three hours you could binge watch "afterlife" instead of watching this show. That's a show about a man who wants to kill himself because his wife dicees of cancer and it still more fun than this, okay spoiler alert, season two is on the way, so in the end obviously he didn't kill himself just like Jeffrey Epstein. Shut up. I know he's your friend, but I don't care you have to make your own way here, your own plane, didn't you? But seriously, most films are awful, lazy. Remakes, sequels I've heard a rumor there might be a sequel to "sophie's choice." That would just be Meryl Streep going, well, it's got to be this one then all the best actors have jumped to Netflix and hbo, you know the actors who just do Hollywood movies do fantasy adventure nonsense their job isn't acting anymore it's going to the gym twice a day and taking steroids. Really do we have an award for most ripped junkie? No point, we know who would win that Martin scorsese, the greatest living director made the news for his controversial comments about the marvel franchise he said they're not real cinema and they remind him of theme parks. I agree, although I don't know what he's doing hanging around theme parks. He's not big enough to go on the rides. Tiny "the irishman" was amazing it was amazing [applause] It was it was great long, but amazing. It wasn't the only epic movie. Once"once upon a time in hollyw Hollywood," nearly three hours long Leonardo DiCaprio attended the preview and by the end, his date was too old for him. Even prince Andrews was like, come on, Leo, mate, you're nearly 50-some the world got to see James corden as a fat pussy. He was looser in the movie "cats" but no one saw that and the reviews, oh, shocking. I saw one that said this is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs but dame judi dench defended the film saying it was the role she was born to play because she -- I can't do this next joke. Because she loves nothing better than plunking herself down on the carpet, lifting her leg, and licking her [muted]. Fur ball fur ball she's old school it's the last time, who cares? Apple roared into the TV game with "the morning show," a superb drama [applause] A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing right thing made by a company that runs sweat shops in China you say you're woke but the companies you work for, unbelievable apple, Amazon, Disney. If Isis started a stream service, you would call your agent, wouldn't you? So if you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech, right? You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta thunberg if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your god, and [muted]. [Applause] It's already three hours long.

[Applause] Announcer: and now from "saturday night live" and "bombshell," Kate McKinnon [applause] Hello how are you guys the Carol Burnett award is given to someone who, like its namesake, Carol Burnett, has given us decades of laughter, tears, and a new sense of what's possible so I would like to read a list of things that tonight's recipient Ellen degeneres has personally given me. Some of these are spiritual and some of them are pieces of clothing I got to keep after doing impressions of her on her talk show. A roadmap for a way to be funny that is grounded in an expression of joy. Two pairs of Sam Smith sneakers. That's one of the close ones a desire to bring everyone together by laughing about the things that we have in common. My best collared shirts. A sense of self. I have to explain that one more. In 1997, when Ellen's sitcom was at the height of its popularity, I was in my mother's basement lifting weights in front of the mirror and thinking, am I gay? And I was. And I still am [cheers and applause but that's a very scary thing to suddenly know about yourself it's sort of like doing 23andme and discovering you have alien DNA. And the only thing that made it less scary was seeing Ellen on TV she risked her entire life and her entire career in order to tell the truth and she suffered greatly for it of course attitudes change, but only because brave people like Ellen jump into the fire to make them change. And if I hadn't seen her on TV, I would have thought, I could never be on TV, they don't let lgbtq people on TV, and more than that, I would have gone on thinking that I was an alien and that I maybe didn't even have a right to be here so thank you, Ellen, for giving me a shot. [Applause] A shot at a good life. And thank you also for the sweater with the pictures of baby goat on it. Let's take a look at her career. When we try on shoes, we do things we're never going to do in them. We stand up. These are good these are good I like these please give a warm welcome to Ellen degeneres. You have to stay in shape my grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was she's 90 today and we don't know where the hell she is. Her first appearance on network television, Ellen degeneres.

Has the world been talking about that it was called the puppy episode because we wanted to keep it a secret until we aired and Ellen throwing her career away seemed to be on the nose. I lost my sitcom when I came out. The same people who loved me, overnight they hated me. There was only one place to go after that, and that is world domination turn off the news, turn on Ellen. You will feel better ♪♪ We use 10 % of our brains. Imagine what we could accomplish if we used the other 60 % do you know what I'm saying?

I hate being asked to do things like this, so thank you for doing this, thank you for flying here, thank you for writing something, thank you for the amazing -- the words that you said, thank you so much, I love you. I love you thank you so much to the Hollywood foreign press. I feel humbled and honored to receive this the first person after Carol Burnett is quite an honor, so thank you so much. It's a prestigious award what I like most about it is I knew coming in that I would win. I mean, there's nothing worse than sitting there like most of you, waiting and wondering if you're going to win and politely acting like, I'm going to listen to everyone's speeches and it's nice, because it's not, people go on and on and on and on and on and you're like, eh I'm not going to do that, I'm going to be quick. Although offi don't have to beca it's a special award and they don't play me off, I mean, I don't have to end at all because it's a special award but they said they were going to get me a sign at 25 minutes but that's for my reference, just to see where I was. But I could go on. I'm not. I'm going to keep it quick I was born in New Orleans in [laughter] January 26th Dr. Swanson delivered me at 8:43 in the morning a rainy, rainy -- I mean, Louisiana, a heavy rain. My parents drove me home in a buick. I think it was a buick it could have been a Ford or a Chrysler I think it was a buick the point is, they brought me home in a car. And before I knew it, I had a successful sitcom and I came out. And then I lost that sitcom and then I got another sitcom and lost that sitcom too then I got to do something I had never been able to do before and that is make my own whiskey. And after that, I got a talk show and I was able to be myself. And that was 17 years ago. And I feel like you've all really gotten to know me over the past 17 years. I am an open book. And I couldn't have done it without my husband Mark. [Laughter] Mark, you are my rock. Thank you for supporting me through this crazy journey I know it wasn't easy for you or the kids, Rupert and Fiona, go to bed, I love you that's funny because they're in college now. But the point is, you all know me obviously you know me or else you wouldn't have laughed at all that I feel like we all think we know someone. There's a connection when we watch someone on TV for as long as we are on TV. And that's what it was like for me with Carol Burnett. I felt like I knew her I felt like she showed us who she was every week she was larger than life [cheers and applause we counted on her to make us feel good and she delivered every single week. She never let us down. She was hilarious in all the sketches she did when she did the q&a with the audience she was just genuine and personal and I always felt like she was speaking to me. At the end of the show, every time she pulled her ear, I knew she was saying, it's okay, I'm gay too. [Laughter] Television inspiresd and influenced everything that I am today. Lucille ball, Mary Tyler Moore, marlo Thomas, dick Van dyke, Bob newhart, mannix. There is a little bit of all of them in me that didn't sound right, but you know what I'm saying all I've ever wanted to do was make people feel good and laugh. There's no greater feeling than when someone tells me that I've made their day better with my show or that I've helped them get through a sickness or a hard time in their lives. But the real power of television for me is that -- not that people watch my show, but people watch my show and then they're inspired to go out and do the same thing in their own lives, make people laugh or be kind or help someone less fortunate than themselves that is the power of television. I'm so, so grateful to be a part of it. Thank you so much, everybody [cheers and applause ♪♪ The spectacular stars o >hello. We're back "knives out" has three nominations tonight.

I have to step out I'll be right back and then we'll do that scene. Tom didn't need five minutes I needed five minutes.

Can I just -- tell the truth now, can I just see a show of hands, how many people in this room have a clip package that includes the love boat anybody? Well, you -- charlise. What do we have? Love, exciting and new I have a cold. Forgive me, I'm a little jittery. A man is -- sorry. A man is blessed with family sitting down in front like that a wife that is fantastic in every way, that taught me what love, is five kids that are braver and stronger and wiser than their old man is. And a loving group of people who have put away with me being away months and months and months at a time, of course, otherwise I wouldn't be standing here if they didn't have to put up with that I can't tell you how much your love means to me so that's the wife and kids. You know, you're a dope if you don't steal from everybody you ever worked with and I have stolen from the likes of the people that only need one name, you know like Meryl Streep, like Denzel, like Antonio, like Meg, Julia, Sally field, but I have also been made better by watching the examples of some of the greatest actors that have ever walked the stage, Peter scalari and Holland Taylor, a million years ago. Robin Wright, barkob abdi that was so much very many e. Very much in August, there is no doubt about it and charlize theron who is one of those one word names. The reason I had to leave the room, the reason I had to leave the room for five minutes is to go and tell all the other producers that this woman that I'm auditioning right now is going to be in this movie somehow so we have to figure out how it's going to work and she was. I have never not been challenged or lost sleep because of the work that I was asked of me by the directors that I've worked with, every single one of them, the screen writers I worked with, every single one of them there is Nora and penny, marchy of late, Stephen and Ron, Paul, Bob, the list goes on, Clint, the list goes on and on. Every one of those, every one of those guys at some point or another came up to me in the course of a day and said tomorrow if you don't do your job really well, we don't have a movie. And this is a thing that you -- that happens with actors at some point on a movie -- a movie is made shot by shot, everybody knows that Marty score xaz yes knows it, Jackie chan knows a movie is made shot by shot. At that moment what is required is everybody has to do their job to their perfection. They have to hit a Mark and they have to go there sometimes the movie rests on the shoulders of the makeup artist who put on Stella's eyebrows sometimes it's the focus puller that if it's not sharp, it shows up and you have to do it all over again but it's those moments assen an actor where everybody I worked with helped me get to that place, sometimes it's 3:00 in the morning, and sometimes it's 11:00 at night in which you just have to somehow put it all together, have faith in the process and go there 1,000 years ago in 1977, when I was an ipntern at my first professional job, we all got yelled at by Dan Sullivan, the director we partied a little bit too much the night before we were showing up for rehearsals and he screamed at us, well, did he scream at us. He said, look, you guys, you guys, you actors, you know what your job is? You know what your job is? Show up on time and you have to know the text and you have to have a headful of ideas. The otherwise I can't do my job! That was the greatest lesson a young actor could possibly have ever get first of all, the head full of ideas. Bring anything try anything they might not use it. If it stinks, twhoenlt use it. Am I right, Marty scorsese if it's not good, let's see the outtakes from that movie, by the way. Knowing the text and it's not just your lines, it's the whole thing. It's the red dot it's the theme of the movie. You have to know it. You might not be right in what the opinion you bring to ut. But you have to come at it with some direction and as charlize theron mighten into the other people that may have worked with us through the galaxy of stars, showing up on time is one of the greatest liberating acts can you give your self in a movie that means those people with radios in the ears don't need to knock on your door and say they're ready for you. You're actually already ready and you have the Liberty and you have the freedom of being there early enough to settle down because when the time comes, you have to hit the marks. And you have to go there there is a saying in motion pictures back when it was shot on film, you could not move on to the next scene until the gate was good the film went through the little -- let me explain it to the kids at home the film went through a shut eastern had to go through the gate and sometime a piece of film would fall off and the shot would be ruined. You couldn't save it in the lab. The gate had to be good before you could move on. So up in that voice of god -- all right. That's wonderful cut! Shut the gate. He'd say something like that and then they would shut the gate if the gate was good, then you moved on ladies and gentlemen, I'm such a -- it's the cold that is making this happen sort of -- I'm not nearly this emotional at home. Well, thank you. Thank you all here thank you all for all your inspiration. And all of your work and all of this struggle that you guys all go through in order to hit the marks and tell the truth I have checked the gate. Gate is good thank you. ♪♪ Amazing our next category, no female directors were nominated this year not one.
