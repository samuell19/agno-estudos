The stocktake shouldn't take us long, anyway. I got loads done last night. Well, doesn't seem much point in closing early, then. Shall I have a word with Priya? You could... Or we could make the most of having the place to ourselves. Yeah, I realise it sounded like I was coming on to you. Aw, I always knew we'd end up together (!) Well, obviously. We'd be Emmerdale's premier power couple. No, I was thinking we have ourselves a cheeky little lock-in. And Luke's up for it. Oh, well, I'll have to check my diary and see if I'm free... Ah, yeah, I forgot... I'm always free. I have no life. Well, today, you do. Well, in that case, I'll go and get some wine or something and see you there. Amy said yeah. How you getting on with Matty? Piece of cake. And he didn't suspect anything? No. I just told him there'd be girls there, he almost bit my hand off. Ah, you have done well, my young apprentice. Well, I aim to please. D'you know, I've got a really good feeling about today. Operation M-amy... Atty...? Yeah, we'll work on that. But Operation Matty and Amy is a go! Something beautiful for the most beautiful woman in the world. Oh, wow, they're lovely. Thank you. Well, you deserve the very best. Are you sure you like them? Sorry, er, I'm just a bit tired, that's all. I'm not surprised, the amount you do. Yeah, just been, er... Things have been getting on top of me a little bit lately. Which is why I thought it'd be a good idea to get away from the village this afternoon. So, I've booked us a table at Santiago's, in Harrogate. Oh, wow, I really love it there. I know you do. Cos it's my job to make you happy. Thanks for taking the time to visit the old man. I still feel a bit anxious coming round here. That's to be expected. This is your home, so I'm not gonna let what happened sour it for me. I might even try to get to know some of the locals. I'm proud of you, son. Just make sure you give Sarah hell. I'm not sure about "hell", but I'll try and point her in the right direction. How's work been? Not the same since my reputation as a notorious druggy's been doing the rounds. The case has been dropped, surely they don't believe it. I don't know what they think, but the vibe's been totally different. I don't know, maybe it's time I looked elsewhere. Are you all right there? Er, yes, ha, ha... I have just, er, underestimated how heavy boxes of wine are. Oh, yeah, that's right... Wine in a box, I'm classy like that. Thirsty, are we? Oh, no, it's not all for me. We're having a lock-in at the Hide later. But, erm, I realise I probably shouldn't be saying that to the whole world. Your secret's safe with me. Ah, you're the new vicar, are you? I'm Amy. Ah, please, call me Charles. And this is my son, Ethan. Hiya. Ooh, I, er, heard about the Sarah thing. Not exactly the best welcome to the village. No, we usually wait until at least, pfft, your third visit to plant drugs on you. Guess I got lucky! Well, I hope it hasn't put you off? No. I was just telling Dad that I, erm, might try and get to know some of the locals. Oh, yeah, anyone in mind? I dunno... If only there was some sort of lock-in going on somewhere... Ah, you are so welcome to join! Yeah? Yeah. I mean, it's just a select, bijou gathering of some of Emmerdale's high rollers. Really? Nah, it's just me, Vic, and Luke. But I've never used the word bijou in a sentence before, so... You used it beautifully. Cheers. Right, better crack on. Er, see you in a couple of hours and I can introduce you to the gang. Cool, I'll see you then. DEBBIE: 'Hey, it's me. 'Thought I'd give you a call and say hi, and I miss you. 'Listen, things have been crazy with the kids, 'but I'm free all afternoon. So, if you wanna meet, 'I'll definitely make it worth your while. Let me know.' Right, let's get going. Er, babe, I'm so sorry... I just had a reminder I've got a meeting in town this afternoon. It's completely slipped my mind. Right, well, I'll come with you, keep you company. No, no, look, it may take a while. Look, you go home, put your feet up, and I'll see you later. OK? OK... RADIO PLAYS Where's your brother? Er, he's not come down yet. Well, I hope he's found some digs, cos he's not stopping here another night. I don't think he's got anywhere else to stay. Why doesn't that surprise me? You know he's gonna let you down. Look, I just wanna give him a chance. Well, he's had plenty of chances, and he's thrown them back in your face every time. I just hope you don't end up disappointed. Where you going? I'm going to see Nate and Tracy. Make sure they're all right. Bye, then. DOOR CLOSES Morning. It's half twelve. And I've been waiting all this time for breakfast in bed. The service here is terrible. Still think you're funny, do you? I know I am. Yeah? Well, Kim might not agree. And neither will Cain if he finds out she's coming for you. Cain's got a sense of humour? He kept that quiet. Hey, he wants you gone. And what about you? Well, you know I want you here, just need to convince Cain. And we should probably keep the Kim stuff between us for now. Yeah? Whatever. Hey, you need to take this seriously. You could get into a lot of bother. Do you think she's gone to the police already? If she had, they'd be here by now. Well, what's... what's she waiting for? Oh, I dread to think. She seems to really have it in for Cain. She's coming for the garage big time. I saw her looking at plans. Plans? What plans? She wants to run the place into the ground, buy it cheap, and build something there. So that's why she had you targeting the garage? I guess. Ha... Right, you sit tight, I'll make you something to eat. Then you can tell me everything that scheming cow's been up to. One stocktake, done! Oh! You're here. Wow, there's a welcome (!) No, I mean, it's... it's nice that you're here. It's just, I thought it was your day off. Yeah, it is. I'm here for the lock-in. Great. Excuse me... So, erm... Matty's here, then? Yup. It's not a problem, is it? Problem? There's no problem. I do have one question, though... Is this some sort of lame-o attempt by you guys to get me and Matty in the same room together? Er, I mean, I'm actually really offended that you think we'd be so underhand and sly. But it is, though? Yeah. It's exactly that. Brilliant... This is so cringe. It's also a golden opportunity to get you guys out of the friend-zone... DEEP VOICE: ..and into the "love" zone. Ugh. Never do that voice again. So, does anyone fancy taking me on? Amy does. Good luck. Ah, Moira, do come in. I thought I could smell the stench of farm wafting through. All this time you have wasted being the local bitch when you could've been a stand-up comedian... Seems such a shame. I always love a witty retort. Come back when you have one. Hmm. We've been waiting all morning for the police to show up, but they still haven't arrived. Did you forget to call them? On my to-do list. Or was it an empty threat because Mackenzie could just tell the police that you set the whole thing up? Being a fine, upstanding pillar of the community that he is, er, I'm sure they'd believe every word. True, but they'll probably think you getting Noah off the hook and sitting on the CCTV was a little bit fishy. I don't think it'd take much to convince them that he threatened to kill me if I took that footage to them. So, why haven't you called them yet? Cos I'm enjoying myself. Oh, ho, ho, Kim, you need to get out more. You know your brother hates your guts, don't you? Literally had nothing nice to say about you at all. You should hear what he thinks about you. Have you ever considered Mack's back with you because I want him to be there? You can try and get inside my head all you like, but I'm not gonna play your games. And this pathetic grudge that you have against my family... It ends now. That's where we differ, I'm afraid. As far as I'm concerned... it's barely even begun. Yes! Ugh... Are you sure you've never played this before? Oh, beginner's luck. Helps having a good teacher, mind... Ethan, you came! You sure this is all right? Yeah, course. What is a party without a gatecrasher? Ethan, this is Matty... All right, mate. Hi. How's it going, you all right? Yeah. Victoria. Hiya. Hi. So, Ethan, how do you know Amy? Oh, we go way back to, erm, dinnertime... She was trying out the word bijou on me... Ooh, fancy. And I randomly invited myself to your party. Ah, Luke, this is Ethan. Hiya, mate. Hi. Amy, could I have a word, please? Yeah, sure. What you doing here? Er, Amy invited me. It's been a while. How... how you doing? Er, yeah, good. Look... A lot's changed since I last saw you. Erm... It would really help me out if we act like we haven't met. Right... So, as far as anyone's concerned, we don't know each other. I cannot tell you how happy I am to see you. I feel like I haven't been out of the house for weeks. Teenage daughters are hell. I bet you were a right handful. Still am. Oh, then I'll have to keep a close eye on you. DISTANT BANG You're a bit jumpy, you all right? No, not at all. I just know how important it is to keep this under wraps. You know, for you. I've gotta be honest, though, I'm digging the whole deserted barn in the countryside thing. You know what we have, it... it's more than just sex, isn't it? Debbie, where's this coming from? Oh, I dunno. I just feel like my head goes to weird places sometimes. Just... just need a bit of reassurance, that's all. Then hear this... You're my world. And I couldn't love you more. I tell you what... You wait here, I'm gonna pop home and change into something that will blow your mind... Oh, I can't wait. So, Ethan's hot. I know, right? Like, really hot. Yeah. No, that's not why I invited him here. So, you're still interested in Matty? God, yes! But he is so beyond not interested, it's not even funny. He's probably just acting like he's not interested because he doesn't know that you are. You need to show him what he's missing. Ooh, go and flirt with Ethan. And see how Matty reacts. It's hardly the most mature approach. What have you got to lose? Er, my dignity. Babe, you can't lose something you never had. Now, go over there, and throw yourself at that complete stranger. Hey, are you OK? You seem a bit quiet. Just tired. How's Operation Amy and Matty going? Oh, we've only gone and made it into phase two. Which is? Desperation. AMY CACKLES WILDLY Are you, er... you OK? Yeah... Look... This might sound a bit weird, but... Well, long story short, me and Matty are destined to be together, it's just he doesn't know it yet. So, I am... Pretending to flirt with the new guy to make him jealous? Hardly my finest hour. Sorry. Lucky for you, I've done this a thousand times before. I think it's best you follow my lead. That fake laugh was... Hi. Where have you been? Out. Out where? I was looking for a job. I spoke to Kim. Oh, yeah. About what? Everything. You. Look, what's... what's Kim said? You're here because she wants you here. Well, that's a total lie. She's... she's just mixing things up. That's what I thought. You have a home here for as long as you want, but please... Please don't betray me. It means everything to me you being back into my life. I won't go near that crazy bint again. Honest. Good. And, er, she's got no intention of going to the police... Oh, thank God. How did you talk her out of that? DOOR OPENS Still here? I'm not just gonna turf him out. Well, I can. Just say the word. I want him to stay. And if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. He knows he's fresh out of chances. Don't you? I won't mess up again. Best behaviour from now on, I promise. Any more funny business, I'll drop kick you all the way back to Glasgow, got it? Loud and clear, boss. You destroyed me! What happened to going easy on the new guy? Oh, I don't take any prisoners. I'm beginning to think that was all a hustle. Never underestimate me. I am a woman of many talents. Oh, I bet you are! He is magnificent. Even I'm a bit jealous. Having fun? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great... If we eke this out any longer, it's just plain cruel. He looks set to burst. Right. I'm going in. Here goes nothing. Ah, erm, can I have a...? Look, I need to come clean. About? Ooh, all sorts. I, erm... I know I've messed you around a bit, and you probably think that I'm not worth the hassle, but... I really like you, Matty. You what? I've liked you for ages. What about you and, er... Ethan? I thought you guys were... Ah, so, er... That's confession number two. I wasn't sure if you still liked me or not, so I resorted to the cheapest trick in the book to see if you did. Er, kinda hoping it worked, and I haven't just exposed myself as the massive weirdo I actually am. I really wanna kiss you. Supply cupboard? Now, that is what I call a result. So, Ethan... Hello. Hi. Why don't you tell us about yourself? And don't skimp on the details. Ah, I, erm... I live in Leeds, and I work as a lawyer. Single? Definitely single. I, erm... I've been taking a break from dating. I've got the worst taste in men ever. Yeah, I know the feeling. Oh, so you guys, erm... You guys are together? Why so surprised? It's cos I'm massively out of his league, isn't it? I get it all the time. Ha... You know what? Erm, this beer's really not agreeing with me. Oh, no. Are you OK? Erm, yeah, I feel a bit sick. Er, I just need some air. You know, I thought something was bothering him. He's never normally this quiet. Mm. PHONE RECORDING, DEBBIE: 'You know what we have, it... 'it's more than just sex, isn't it?' AL: 'Debbie. Where's this coming from?' 'Oh, I dunno. 'I just feel like my head goes to weird places sometimes. 'Just... Just need a bit of reassurance, that's all.' 'Then hear this. You're my world.' OK, turn it off. Sorry, sorry, but you needed to hear that. D'you know what, I really thought that, deep down, he really did love me? And that all of this was just a blip. God, I'm so sorry for doubting it. I am such an idiot. No, Priya, you're not. He is convincing. Sorry. It just really hurts. I know. So, he stayed at the barn and waited for you? Yeah. It was a long wait, though. And then I finally text him and said summat had come up. But you know what, that is it now. He has got it coming, no more waiting. I should've made another bank transfer last night, but stupid me felt sorry for him. But I've got my head back in the game now. Good. I'll make another transfer later this evening. D'you know what? I can't... I can't be around him for one more minute without wanting to punch his face in. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he realises he has lost absolutely everything. By tomorrow, we will have everything in place to blow his miserable little life into pieces. Hey. What was that about? Nothing. Just forget it. I didn't think I'd ever see you again. Not after the way you walked out. Well, it was for the best. So, what's the deal round here? I'm with Victoria now. We're happy. Yeah, she seems nice. Really nice. Yeah, and I don't want anything to spoil that. I don't get what your problem is. Look, my girlfriend... Victoria... She's been through a lot. And I don't want her to think that I've lied to her over something that doesn't mean anything anyway. Don't worry, I'm not gonna out you, or... I'm not gay. I never said you were. Or bi. Ste, Stephen... Stephen was a one-time thing. Look, your sexuality is nothing to be ashamed of. Look, I don't wanna get into this with you, all right? You don't know me. And I don't know you, all right? So just stay the hell away.
