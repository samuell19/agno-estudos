[music playing] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. BEN [VOICEOVER]: Maybe it waslife's way of getting even, extracting what's old, like some landlord, when the rent's overdue. I'd talked my way intoplenty, and talked my way out. Only this time, if there was anyone up there, they weren't listening. So let's go back a little way toa sunny day when it all began. [train whistling] I was a real estate agent witha prosperous little real estate firm called Pierce and Company. You've probably seen ourads in the Saturday papers. $195,000. The bid is against you, sir. That's 195 I have. That's 195. Do I hear more? Now, ladies and gentlemen,this has to be the bargain of-- [train whistling] Transport at your door. Now, I'm sure you've taken that into account, so I'll take your 2,000,if that'll make it easier. I have 197. Thank you, sir. At 197, I am bid. At-- $199. 199. Thank you, sir. At 199 now. For the first call. At $199,000. The second call, at $199,000,waiting on your bid, sir. Are you all done? Are you all sorted? Are you with me, sir? No? We can't do it. A bit high. Ladies and gentlemen,will you excuse me while I refer the bid to the vendor? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. VINCENT: What are you doing, Ben? You've lost them. You should've brought the hammer down at 197. This house is a dump. BEN [VOICEOVER]: That's Vincent Pierce, my boss. --try to push them higher.19-- BEN [VOICEOVER]: Vincent wasn't angry with me. He never got angry with me. I was the golden-haired boy, theson, he was fond of telling me, that he always wanted. He'd just give me a littlefatherly advice now and again, which I got a kick out of ignoring, just to prove him wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, I'vehad instructions from the vendor that this property will be sold this morning. And as we all know, the footballdoesn't start till 2 o'clock, so don't desert me now. So at 199, will you confirm your bid, sir? At 199, I have. At $199,000, I am fairly bid and offered now. I'll take a 1,000 if you like, sir. 1,000 if you like, make it a clear 200. Moment to think. Moment to think. Clear 200. 200, I have. Now, at $200,000, I have now. The bid is against you, sir. At $200,000, I have now. At two-- excuse me. Is that a bid, sir? I'm not Superman. I can't see behind those glasses. MAN: 201. $201,000, I have now. At-- listen, I'll make it easier for you. I'll take your 500, and you've got the shops. You've got the transport,the school, and a room that's ideal as a nursery. What is it, a little boy or girl? - Girl. - Girl? What's her name? Melissa. Melissa. Well, Melissa could have her own room. You know the room that I mean. I can just see it now, painted in a pale pink, "Melissa's room." I bet she'd bid if she could. So at $201,000 for the first call. At $201,000 for the second call. Ladies and gentleman, make no mistake. Make no mistake. This property will be sold thismorning to the highest bidder. So $201,000 for the third and final call. Are you all done? Are you all out? You're silent. Are you out, sir? Are you out? 500. $201,500. It's an absolute mouthful,but a pleasure for me to say. Once, twice, three times.Sold. [applause] WOMAN: Congratulations. You must be very excited. Congratulations. A decision you won't regret. Thanks, mate. Congratulations. You know, there was a horrible moment there where I thought the tall guy insunglasses was going to get it. It was awful. We decided on a spur ofthe moment to sell our car and make up the difference. Well, it's sacrifices like that that made this country great. I mean, think of thepioneers crossing the plains in their covered wagons. You're the pioneers making sacrifices-- making a new start. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Anyway, Sharon has some papers for you to sign. Uh, 10% now, balance in 60 days. Welcome home. I'll just get the papers. What crap. Our pioneers crossing theplains in covered wagons? Well, we don't want to spoiltheir dreams, then, do we? BEN [VOICEOVER]: And that'sSharon, Vincent's only child. Sharon, Vincent, and I alltalk the same language. It's a dialect of English called money. I had the girl I loved,and I had the job I loved. You be needing me again soon? Hallelujah. BEN [VOICEOVER]: Vincent'shouse in Toorak could easily accommodate a family of three and a family pet, and it had a backyard thesize of an 18th fairway. There was Vincent and Sharon, of course, and Vincent's second wife,Marcia, and a dog, Maxie. How a dog could have stomachulcers living that lifestyle was beyond me, but this one did. Well, what do you think? You're right. They should sell fast. The lot I want to build it on-- you couldn't get a better position. Right on the river, closeto the city, enough room to build 14 luxury townhouses. And it's up for auction 6 o'clock tonight. So you like it, eh? Yeah, sure. You should clean up. Not just me, Ben. No? Who? Me? 50/50. MARCIA: Vinny! I'm guessing yoursister's 21st is on tonight. I'll be in the bad booksfor a month if I don't go. I'll need you to bid for me. MARCIA: Vinny, what have youbeen giving Maxie to eat? She's been chucking up. Oh, that bloody dog. I gave her some ham. I feel fine. Well, I'm gonna take her to the vet. VINCENT: OK, doll. Don't let her puke in the car. You feel OK? Uh, I-- yeah, yeah. Vincent, this is fantastic,but I haven't got any capital. You know that. You don't need any capital. I'll put up the capital. We share the profits 50/50. Wa-- I can't have my girlmarrying some bum, can I? It's a fortune, Vincent. This is where I'll be tonight. Ring me as soon as you get the land. OK. Uh, m-- for the bidding, limit? No limit. I want that block. I'll bet you when you came towork for me three years ago, you never expected an offer like this. Hm? Hm? BEN [VOICEOVER]: I'd done it. I always thought I'd dowell out of this marriage, but I hadn't counted on doing this well, and doing it this quickly. G'day, Jack. How are you? BEN [VOICEOVER]: It's a peculiar thing, how having money or the prospect of it can make you impatient withthose who don't have any. [squeaking] BEN: Hey. It's OK. I know I make you angry. You don't make me angry. JILL: Yes, I do. The worst thing is I'm justthe same as mum was, aren't I? Swore I wouldn't stuff up life the way she did. All right. You have to pay that firstthing in the morning. Don't tell me what to do. Jill, I wish you'd considercoming to the wedding. You and Jack-- you'rethe only family I've got. You don't want your poor sister embarrassing you. I don't fit in with those people. Oh, don't be silly. I'll get you a dress, whatever you need. I'll buy you a new dress. It's no problem. Nothing's ever a problem for you, is it? BEN [VOICEOVER]: I stillhad time to go for a run, and I needed the air. All that remained for me now wasto make the bid at the auction. I was on top of the world. I couldn't do a thing wrong. But if I had to choose amoment-- one solitary second in which the world turned upside down for me, it would have to be then, as my fingers closed around that ball. Well, how's that? My bad. What a catch! I'll show you how you should've played. KID: You ready? [inaudible], you've lost our ball. Them's the breaks, kid. Go and find it. See you. [alarm sounding] Shit, shit, shit, shit! SECURITY: Park security. Hold it right there. Face the vehicle. Put your hands on the roof, legs apart. Hang on a sec. What do you think this is? SECURITY: Do it now. Th-- this is my car. Turn around. Oh, bloody hell. Listen, you dimwit. This is my car. Didn't you hear me? What's your name, pal? What's your name, pal? That's what I want to know-- your bloody name. Don't try anything. Stay calm and no one will get hurt. Now, I want your name. Listen, you jumped-up-- Your name. [chatter] Uh, Cara, have you got my Wite-Out? How come you're charging me? I mean, the other bloke started it. I-- I was just defending myself. Look, I've got to get to an auction. Ah, and there it is, on SeniorConstable Mark Rogers' desk. Thank you, Senior Constable Mark Rogers. That's all right, Sarge. At least I kept the top on. Hm. Look, I've told you. I have to make a phone. Can I please make a phone call? The phone? You'll be lucky. Nobody gets near the phonewhen Cara's around here. Oh, for god's sake, what'swrong with you people? I am not a criminal. I didn't kill anyone. I hit a crick ball, and it smashed my window. You want to fine me for that? For smashing my own window?Well, go ahead. Fine me. But let me go, because in 55 minutes there is going to be anauction to decide my future, and I am not going to bethere all because when I asked some jumped-up little Naziif I could have my keys back, he got all upset and took a swing at me. What, you mean biff, just like that? No, not like that. Like this. BEN [VOICEOVER]: I spent three hours in that cell while the time for the auction came and went. I'd lost the land. I was looking down thebarrel of a jail sentence, and I still had to face Vincent. OFFICER: OK. Egan, you got bail. I'm so disappointed, Ben. I feel betrayed. Offer you everything,this is what you do to me? It was an accident. There I was, thinking you were at an auction. In some bloody police cell-- Iwas actually enjoying myself, wasn't I, Sharon? I'll tell you one thing. I can't risk my reputation by having some jailbird working for me. You go to jail, everything'soff-- the deal, the marriage. I'll get you the best lawyer. I can't be fairer than that. If that fails-- Dad, please, he's had enough for one night. What are you going to use for money? A picture of you living in somepokey little flat somewhere? BEN [VOICEOVER]: Vincent got me the best lawyer, and the best lawyer got me100 hours community service. The magistrate told meit was a lenient sentence for such a vicious attack on a policeman and a park security officer. I was about to object, but thebest lawyer told me to shut up and count myself lucky. Lucky. Here I was, under a courtorder, to spend my evenings with a bunch of socialmisfits and welfare bludgers at a drop-in center a called River Street. [music playing] HOOLIGAN: Hey, get off my car! [wolf call whistling] Go, go, ho. BEN [VOICEOVER]: And out the front was a bunch of teenagers keen to practice their standover tactics beforethey graduated to the big time. Let me hear you say ho, yeah, yeah. Let me hear you say ho, yeah, yeah. Let me hear you say ho! Oh, yeah! Ho, let me hear you say ho. Let me hear you say ho. Let me hear you say ho. Oh, yeah! HOOLIGAN: Hey! Oy! [pinball machines] [whistling] Oh, god. [whistling] [blood-curdling screaming on tv] I'm looking for, uh, Wendy Davis. - She'll be down in a minute. Community service? Is this her office? AHMED: You resent being here, don't you? I can tell. You do, don't you? I'll tell you what I resent. I work hard for a living-- very hard-- and I don't like the idea of coming down here to this daycare center,or whatever you call it, using what little free time I have to help out a bunch of socialmisfits and welfare bludgers. WENDY: OK, Ahmed, you can turn it on now. AHMED: That's Wendy Davis. WENDY: Thanks, Ahmed. Someone around here's acrack shot with a shanghai. Every now and again the lights get blasted. So you're the guy who beat up the cops. No, l-- it was-- it was one cop, accidentally. Just one? That's a pity, Ahmed. I was hoping he was goingto be a genuine tough guy. Him? You're kidding. BEN [VOICEOVER]: She was justhow I imagined she would be, maybe a bit younger than I'd thought. I mean, anyone doing her job would have to wear overalls and think that they were some kind of Mother Teresa. And as for that shadow ofhers-- that smart-ass kid with the jokes-- what was his problem? This is for the new sewage pipes. We're trying to save some moneyby doing the digging ourselves. As far as I'm concerned, you did me a favor when you punched those cops. These should fit you. Come on. The trench has to follow the pegs, and you stop at the last peg, OK? What's this for? You dig holes with it. I'm sorry. I don't dig holes. You didn't dig holes. Now you do dig holes. I'd like you to keep it asneat as this one, please. I said I don't dig holes. [beat thumping] [crowd hooting and hollering] [music playing] [singing] Yeah. Feel it. Come on and feel it. Come on and feel it. Come on, yeah. Feel it. Come on, yeah. [clang] It-- um, it broke. How did it break? Chris? Yeah? This is Ben. Ben just broke the only shovel we've got. Ask Edna if we can borrow hers, OK? Yeah. You go with Chris. And Chris? CHRIS: Yeah? WENDY: Say please and thank youand all that stuff, you know. Make her feel important. - Don't worry. I will. WENDY: Thanks. All right. So what's with the, uh-- theplease and thank you speech? Who is this Edna woman? She owns the place. What place? That. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second. She owns the building? Yeah. Center, old cars, everything.Hurry up, man. Come on. I thought the council must've owned it. No. They're trying to shut us down unless we get the money for the new toilets, which is why you're digging a trench. She owns all that land right down to the river? Yes. Are you gonna stand here all night or what, man? Come on. [barking] [knocking] Mrs. Davis, it's me, Chris. Can I come in? EDNA: Kitchen. Hey. You coming? No. You go. She won't want a stranger justwalking through the house. You know how old ladies are. Suit yourself. BEN [VOICEOVER]: Sometimes,in the blackest of nights, there's a little lightgleaming in the distance. The light from Edna's house looked promising. [cat mewling] [hissing] Are you sure those are [inaudible] shovel? No. Piss off. BEN [VOICEOVER]: I did my homework and found out that there was no Mr. Davis. He had died two years ago whilechanging some spark plugs. [knocking] The center and car yard wouldbe perfect for Vincent's townhouses and my 50%. EDNA: Hold your horses. BEN [VOICEOVER]: All I had to do was get one foot inside that door. EDNA: Who is it? Ben Egan's my name. I'm looking for Mr. Davis. EDNA: He's asleep. What's it about? I owe him some money. What money? I'm to have left it this long. You see, with one thing and another, I just forgot to send it to him. My-- my car broke down in thestreet a couple of years ago and-- and Norman was kind enoughto help me get it going again. I just didn't have any cash onme at the time to fix him up. I'm, uh-- I'm Mrs. Davis. Come in. Thank you. Thank you. Norman died two years ago. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I feel terrible I've left it for so long. He was such a kind man. Listen, the bill $40, but I say,with interest, let's make it $50. That's very honest of you. A lot of people wouldn't have bothered. Did you sell the property up the road? I noticed it's a drop-in center now. Ah, it's my granddaughter, Wendy. BEN [VOICEOVER]: It was her, Mother Teresa, a whole mantelpiece full of her. We brought her up. She was only three whenshe came to live with us. Suppose you must'vegot a good price for it-- the business and the land? What? Should I explain, Mrs. Davis? I'm a real estate man. I can't help myself. I just have to know how much something was bought or sold for. I know it's rude, but it's my nature. Just tell me to shut up and I'll go. Mm, I wish I had sold it. I wanted to sell it right after the funeral, but Wendy had this harebrainedidea to turn it into a-- well, you can see what it is. I always hoped she'd makesomething of her life. It's nothing but a millstoneround my neck, I can tell you. Uh, why do you call it a millstone, Mrs. Davis? That's quite an asset you've got there. Now she's got to spendall this money on the place. I forget how much she toldme, but it's a lot of money. Would you like to sell it? Of course I'd like to sellit, but I can't now, can I? I mean, what would Wendy do? Not to mention all the kids. Mm, mm. What about just selling the car yard? Have you thought about doing that? I mean, it's probably on a separate title. It's a big block. You might be surprised howmuch it'd fetch on the market. [birds calling] Yeah, well. Look, if we alter the plans a little, we could fit most of the townhouses on the block. Ben, this is supposed tobe a classy development. We're not building dog kennels here. This block's too narrow. We need the other one as well. I don't know about that, Vincent. She wasn't too keen about that. Her granddaughter runs the place. OK. Well, I'm not interested in this one. I had the perfect block, and we both know what happened to that. They should be half-built by now. I'll ask her again. What about that old charm of yours? You can do it. Maybe. What do you mean maybe? You'll find a way. I've got to get back. [music playing] You all right? Your hand's shaking. Look, when we get in there,try not to say too much. Let me do the talking, all right? You're the boss. [sigh] BEN [VOICEOVER]: So mystooge at my side and all the necessary papers, I wentback to Edna's with a plan to get Vincent all the land he needed. Oy. Congratulations about getting the land. BEN: Thank you. Hm. Mm. We fell on our feet, didn't we, you and me? Oh, don't get me wrong, I love Vinny, and I know you love Sharon. I can tell. It's just my mother alwaysused to say it's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is with a poor one. Why suffer? We're no fools. VINCENT: Party time. Looks like you found yourselfa very bright young fella. I never doubted that for a second. VINCENT: To Ben. To Ben. [ripping] You better fix that. We have to sell it at the [inaudible]. You better sew it back on. Why don't you do it? It's not my job. You're the jailbird. You do it. What's your name? Tania. Well, Tania, I've got $0.20 here that says you want to do it. Oh! There it is. [banging] Just leave him, Chris. Leave him. CHRIS: You're gone, man. You're gone. BEN [VOICEOVER]: Somenights, when there was no one to terrorize in thestreet, Leon and his gang would pay us a visit. Might as well be now, huh? Get out, Leon. Now. BEN [VOICEOVER]: Leon neverstayed long, just long enough to do what he did best-- wreck something. This night it was Chris' motorbike that took his interest. Here, Mick, I'll give you a hand. Thanks, mate. I'll get Ben to driveyou and Tania home later. - I can take care of myself.- Not tonight, you don't. Hoo! Hey, they're not going to jumpout from a bush, you know, man. They don't work like that.- Yeah? How do they work? Well, they'll drive a car at you, if they can. It's got to be something big, though. Chris used to be with them. He used to do that. Yeah. Leon was upset when I left. BEN: You jilted him, eh? Something like that, yeah. I'm going to have a car like this one day. Hard work, that's all it takes. CHRIS: Is that how you got this? Well, I work very hard. I set a goal. I work for it. I want to be a mechanicon McLaren's Formula 1 team. Listen to him. I will. Mick's teaching me the basics. Next I go to tech school. That's my goal. [music playing] Come on. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. What do you want? Um, Mum said we had to sleep here tonight. She never tells me nothing. She just expects a bloody babysitter. All right. There's nothing to eat. You'll have to find somewhere else. That's OK. Hey, you. You want into poker? - Ha. See you. - Just a minute. I'm asking you nicely. Yeah, I can see that. You can deal first. Give me three. BEN [VOICEOVER]: Chris' father won every hand. It wasn't luck. He played by the rules-- his ownrules, which he kept changing. You only put down two. How many? Three. Then give me three. Mhm. I raise you 5 bucks. That's it. I haven't got anything left. 5 bucks I said. [fridge door opening] Get out of that! Eh. Don't come back! Ah, look, it's-- it's late. I should be going home. Besides, you got all my money. You've got a watch. Oh, no, no, no. Not the watch. You want a bit [inaudible] I gave you? Look, I'm not going to put up with this. Sit down! [click] [music playing] Uh, could you le-- could you let me in? You can keep the Rolex. I just want to get back in. Hi, fellas. [WHISPERING LOUDLY] Ben. Ben! Chuck 'em your shoes. Just chuck 'em your shoes. Chris. Chris! [tires squealing] HOOLIGAN: You're dead meat! [mimicking machine guns] Get in! Hey. Hurry up. Come on! [tires squealing] You should be all right now. What about you? You, uh-- you going to be OK? Yeah. I'll be cool. OK. Chris? Yeah? Thanks. Take care now. Here. What's this for? You might need it. [music playing] [click] Don't give me any of that bull. That's for two properties--the spare block and the center. I didn't sell the center. I only sold the spare block. That's why you got as muchmoney as you did, Mrs. Davis. Do you understand? When you sell one block, youget a certain amount of money. When you sell two blocks,you get a lot more money. You wouldn't have got as much money as you did had you onlysold one of the properties. And it was a lot of money. I know what I sold. Hello. You must be Mrs. Davis. I'm Vincent Pierce. And I want it back. Is there a problem, Ben? Mrs. Davis is under the impression that, uh, she sold only one ofthe River Street properties. I-- I know what I did do and what I didn't do. And don't talk to me about impressions. VINCENT: You've definitely soldbut properties, Mrs. Davis, and received a tidy sum for them. I sold the car yard. What would I have sold the center for? I never wanted those old wrecks, so I sold them. I'm sorry, Mrs. Davis. It's all finalized. You can't change your mind now, dear. I'm not changing my mind! I never wanted to sell it. I-- I never said to you thatI wanted to sell the center, did I? You did. No, I-- I couldn't have. I'm sure I made myself clear. I-- I wouldn't have done that. VINCENT: Spare a moment, Ben? I don't know how you did it. I don't want to know. Just keep it as it is. It's all perfectly legal. There's nothing she can do. Now get rid of her. I don't know how I'm going to tell Wendy. I don't know how to tell her. I can't believe I was so stupid. Our office will have to inform her to, uh, vacate the premises. We can do it for you. N-- no, don't tell her yet, please. I have to get my thoughts together. I-- leave a little while, please? I'll call you a taxi, Mrs. Davis. We'll pay for it. WENDY: Ben? [grunting] Chris told me about the other night. How'd you get them? Told Leon you had a bad case of tinea. Thanks very much, I think. BEN [VOICEOVER]: She was being kind and it didn't help one little bit. Careful up there. Yeah. Don't fall. [screeching] Yeah! Hey! Get those kids! Come on! Yah! [door slamming] Somebody give me a hand! [music playing] My car's just around the corner. Why don't we take mine? I didn't know you had a car. Got a [inaudible] BEN [VOICEOVER]: Every time Leon and the gang shot the light bulbs out,they went and got some more. Oh, shit! You haven't got your license, have you? How old are you? 17. Almost. Dah. Move over. I'll drive. Why don't we just walk? Don't be stupid. I'll drive. What, you don't like to walk or something? Get out. You sure? Move it! Now what's wrong? Will you get in the car? It's a real nice night, man. Why don't we walk back? Will you get back in the car before I get out and drag you in? - I'm getting. They're following us. BEN: Who? CHRIS: The cops. So what? [sirens blaring] Relax, man. We haven't done anything wrong. Yeah, we have. What have I done wrong? I was-- I was under the speed limit. I got my headlights on. Ahem. Ben, there's somethingI've got to tell you, man. Oh? The car's borrowed. [scoffing] They'll understand. I mean really borrowed. You mean it's stole? [knocking] Well, here goes nothing. [music playing] Handles nice, yeah? [laughing] Skidster. We'll dump it here. Cool. [barking] [laughing] Hello, Chris. Mrs. Davis. Chris will see you home, OK, Gran? I've got a few things to do. Mm. Where's Ben? I don't know. He was here a moment ago. Is everything all right with Mrs. Davis? I don't know. I was just wondering. She, uh-- she looked upset. She comes out here every now and again to complain about the kids. Tonight she wouldn't talk. I worry sometimes. [child grunting] Do you always get lumberedwith other people's kids? Sometimes. So don't you have a life of your own? What's your idea of life? Making money? Yeah. Why not? I just-- I can't see what-- how you can spend your whole life like this. Like what? So-- so committed. Is money all you think about? N-- not money. Lack of money. See, sometimes I get apicture in my head of a Ben, old and broken, living on the streets. Jeez, you'd be surprised how hard I work when I think of that. What makes you think you'll end up that way? Well, if I don't make money, I will. I find that sad. What's sad about it? I find it sad to see peoplesleeping in doorways. Don't you? Yeah. We're just approachingit from different angles. Well, do you want me to go now? I've sold the center. I've thought I was just selling the car yard. Went over there to-- to tell her that. How can I tell her that I've sold the center? He seemed a nice young man. He called here. He-- he said he owed my husband some money. He was well-dressed. Who, Mrs. Davis? This-- this fellow. The real estate man here. What does this bloke look like? BEN [VOICEOVER]: I'dsearched the motorcycle shops and found what I was looking for to give to Chris. I've been over that day 100 times since then, and I could say that what was to happen had nothing to do with me. SHARON: What are you doing? BEN [VOICEOVER]: But thatwouldn't be the truth. And truth was something I hadnever paid much attention to. What is that? Carburetor. Secondhand but it's in perfect condition, see? I suppose that's where you were all morning-- looking for that thing. Mm. Carburetor. I don't care what it's called. The Donaldsons just rang. Oh, god. I forgot. You were supposed to meetthem at the Talford Street property half an hour ago. I'll get over there right away. You'll need this. Thanks. Get the grease off your mouth. OK. Ben? You won't go and spoil everything, will you? Why would I do that? I want you to stay theperson I thought you were. I'm still me. A-ha! Go. Hurry up. [music playing] G'day. Hey, Mick? Hey, you. What's that on your face? The kids are practicing for tomorrow. I was the first. Say, is-- is Chris here? I don't know what's happened to him. It's the first time he's missed since we started working on the bike. Unless he's sick. Don't know. I-- I got this for him. That's very nice of you, Ben. Thanks. Now I'll be able to have it ready for tomorrow. [music playing] KID: Boo! That goes in the [inaudible] box. When you've got time. Ahmed, let's play a little game. You go and hide, and I'll try tothink up a reason to find you. I like it here. I'll pay you 5 bucks. - No! WENDY: Is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Ahmed, please. Wendy and I can never talkwith you always hanging round. What do you want to talk to her for? It's very normal for twoadults to talk to each other. I find out her interests. She finds out mine. That sort of thing, you know. Then you ask to go to bed with her? [nervous laughter] No. Of course not. I wouldn't do-- I wouldn't do that. OK. 10 bucks. 7. Nah. Beautiful night, isn't it? There's a breeze coming up. Don't you just love nights like these? Ahmed tells me you want to go to bed with me. Oof. Heh. That's not true. I-- I never said that. I'll, uh, take this outside. Chris wants to see you. [engine revving] [music playing] You reckon? Not bad, eh? Very nice. Very nice? Fantastic is what it is. Chris, take the car back. Just dump it. You've got nothing to prove to these guys. I'm not trying to prove a thing. No? What are you doing with this, then? I saw it, and I wanted it. So I took it. But I'm supposed to work hardand then get things, aren't I? Let me tell you something, man. I was working hard at something. How hard did you have to work to make Mrs. Davis sell the center? Hm? Now, look-- You're a liar, man. You are a liar. Get out of my car. Get out of my car. Get out of my car! [music playing] [engine revving] [cheering] GIRL: Hey, where's Chris? ROGERS: Who's in charge, you reckon? BEN: Wendy Davis. ROGERS: Where is she? What do you want her for? She's in her office. ROGERS: You come with me. What's he done? Wendy Davis? WENDY: Yes? I'm Senior Constable Rogers. We need some information. About what? Do you recognize this? Yeah. Has your name on the back. Yeah. ROGERS: How come it's nolonger in your possession? I lost it in a poker game. ROGERS: Who to? Chris' father. Look, nobody stole it. We-- we were betting. I ran out of money. A boy was killed tonightdriving a stolen vehicle. This is all the ID he had on him. Oh, my god. Chris? ROGERS: The car hit a pole. What we need is details about the boy's parents. We'll have to get one ofthem to go to the morgue. [music playing] [thundering] BEN [VOICEOVER]: The road had been swept. There was a small scar on the pole. For a few seconds, his short life had unsettled that tidy little street, and now it had returned to normal. He was my friend. [thundering] [knocking] [doorbell ringing] [knocking] [doorbell ringing] We have to talk about Mrs. Davis. What's wrong? We have to sell her back the center. Ben, for god's sake, go home. W-- we find a different piece of land. We use the same plans. We-- we build the same buildings. I'm going to bed. I conned her, Vincent. I-- I-- I juggled the papers on her. She had no idea what she was signing. Don't worry about it. You got away with it. Look, Ben. I've seen this in blokes before. They get five minutes of guilty conscience. They panic. It'll pass. You'll feel great tomorrow. Where you going? I have to tell them what I did to them. You do that, you get five years jail. And you. You're in this, too. No, I'm not. You did it. I didn't do anything. You conned her. I've just heard of it. I'm shocked-- shocked and disappointed. I'll ring my lawyer and tellhim what you just told me. You're in the [inaudible] squad. They'll arrest you. You'll go to jail. Do you want to go to jail tonight? I could arrange it. No. You want me to ring my lawyer right now? Do you? No. Go home and sleep it off. What's got into you, Ben? You used to be a normal human being. [phone ringing] WENDY [ON PHONE]: Hello? Hello? We-- Wendy, it's me, Ben. WENDY [ON PHONE]: Ben. Are you all right? I-- I need to talk to you. You-- will you be there for a while? [sniffling] Ben. EDNA: That-- that's him. That's the man I'm telling you about. Get out. Get out. We're gonna fight this! You hear me? You hear me? It's no use. She signed the papers. It's all legal. BEN: --gone and I've been snowed on-- Morning, Megan. MEGAN: Good morning. BEN: No, back on board, that. Can you hang on just a second? Morning. You're bright and early. Vincent, can we move thatdemolition forward to the 7th? I just want to get startedon it as soon as possible. That's the day of the wedding. Yeah, that's-- that's right. Have you got a problem with it? Oh, no. BEN: It's the 7th, then? Yep. Uh, Sharon said she'd be a little late for lunch. The fitting for thewedding gown this morning. OK. EDNA: We going to survive this? I left some advertising ideasfor the-- for the property on your desk. - Good. I'll have a look. Oh, and Ben? Good to have you back. [music playing] Jill? NEIGHBOR: She works late tonight. Oh. I brought some things for her. You can leave them with me. I'll make certain she getsthem as soon as she gets home. OK. I've seen you before. You must be her brother. Ben. Could you tell her that I got two pairs of shoes because I wasn't sure of the size. You won't forget to tell her, will you? Soon as she gets in. I won't forget. Thanks. [MUSIC - JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH, "JESU, JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING"] Ben, relax. They just called. They're caught in traffic. I can't breathe in here. Ben. Ben, wh-- don't go too far. They'll be here soon. Jill. Um, I haven't got your present yet. I'm-- I'll get it Monday. Monday's payday. That's all right. Y-- you look beautiful. Got a lovely day. You know, I, um, woke up this morning, and I thought, trust my brother. The weather's perfect. Thanks for coming. I'm a crook, Jill. What? I conned an old lady out of her land. Huh? I don't understand. I conned her. But now there's a bulldozerset to knock down the building. Are you all right, Ben? It's OK. Everything's going to be all right. [chatter] [audio out] --Ben Be-- Give me the keys-- What are you doing? - --to my car. - Ben! Wait. VINCENT: Ben? Get back in the church. I'm going to stop them. SHARON: [WHISPERING] Ben-- VINCENT: Don't do this to me, Ben. Don't do it to me. Oh, Dad, shut up! Ye-- yeah. I need the number for the Richmond Police. Hurry up. [sigh] Don't be a bloody goose. Move it! [smack] Move the bloody thing! [tires squealing] God. VINCENT: What now? Why didn't you knock it down? He won't budge. [finagling door handle] You bloody idiot. What are you trying to do to me? [bulldozer engine revving] Move it! Move it! Move it! [music playing] Go through him! Get out of there! Agh! Oh. Oh. Ch-- [groaning] [yelling] [sirens blaring] [music playing] Can't [inaudible] [coughing] MICK: Come on, then. AHMED: Ben. MICK: Come here. Right. BEN [VOICEOVER]: I made alot of promises at the bottom of that river, and I suppose I'll talk my way out of most of them. Except, one I'll keep for aslong as she wants me to stay. This was the beginning. [MUSIC - DAVID MCCORMACK, "HALLELUJAH"] I heard there was a secretchord that David played and it pleased the Lord, but you don'treally care for music, do you? It goes like this-- the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift, the baffled king composing hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Your faith was strong, but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you. She tied you to her kitchen chair. She broke your throne and she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Baby, I've been here before. I've seen this room and I've walked this floor. You know I used to live alone before I knew you. And I've seen your flag on the marble arch. Love is not a victory march. It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There was a time when you let me know what's really going on below, but now you never show that to me, do you? Remember when I moved in you. The holy dove was moving too. And every breath we drew was hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Maybe there's a God above, butall I've ever learned from love was how to shootsomebody who outdrew you. And it's not a cry you hear at night. It's not somebody who's seen the light. It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
