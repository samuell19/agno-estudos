(somber music) (ominous music) - Hey. I heard that starting from next month they're increasing the tax on our fishing catches. And as usual, it's those damn Japanese. - Yeah, we'll have to pay it. The Japs have taken over Shanghai. Wherever you look now, they're in control. Gets worse everyday. It all looks bad. There's just no hope for us. (foreboding music) (humming tune) - Huh? Hey! Hey you, just stop that! (groaning) This guy's stealing your fish! (groaning) (thudding) - You come back, you lousy thief! Wait till we come after you! (hollering) (thudding) (laughing) - Damn it, have you gone blind? - Sorry, sorry. We were all arguing. They said that karate's useless and boxing's better. So I said it couldn't be. That karate was much more useful and everybody knows that. Then they both beat me up. (ominous music) - Right. (giggling) - Hey, what is it? - From what I hear, you two would like a karate demonstration. - I'm sorry, we're busy. - Hold it! Hold it! You're just a couple of cowards. - Ah! (thudding) - Come on. Come on. (thudding) (whooshing) (thudding) (yelling) (groaning) (thudding) (crunching) (laughing) (exciting beat music) (boat rumbling) (dramatic music) - You're nearly home now. Excited? - Yeah. I am, a little. It's good to be back. Time goes so quickly, huh? It's been 10 years since I left to go to the States. - Remember the time when you won the lightweight championship? I was so thrilled. I almost jumped into the ring. - I'll never forget that. It was the night that I met you. - And then after the match, because you were the first Chinese to ever win that, the reporters wanted to know how you were feeling. - And I said-- - I remember. You said, "You were trained in Chinese boxing, "that was your foundation. "And that this was one of the finest "boxing foundations in the world, without a doubt." And everybody there applauded you and then and there I fell in love with you. What's the matter? (somber music) (boat rumbling) I'm sorry. I brought it all back. I've forgotten. - No. Don't be sorry. I must learn to live with it. (crowd cheering) (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (thudding) - One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. (gasping) (ominous music) - Bill! Bill! Bill! (boat rumbling) - And I swore I would never use my fists again. (waves sloshing) (boat puttering) - Hey! Hey! He's coming! (dramatic music) (cranking) (eerie music) - Welcome back to Shanghai, sir. (eerie music) - So he's back again. That means we're in for more trouble. - Yeah. (thudding) - You idiots! Fools! Why is there no progress?! A hundred thousand troops have been landed in Shanghai and more are coming. The reason we're here is so that we can exploit the area financially. We must raise taxes. Our own economy needs it. This is a poor area. The fishing catches are good. So that's our job. To exploit the fishing community for every cent we can get out of them! Right?! Well then, just how far have you got with this? - Well when we first started, things went fairly smoothly. But then we started to meet some resistance. Finally someone killed Uddo and after they killed him they hung him up! So were weren't sure what to do. I mean, we didn't want to start anything. Not when you were away and so we waited for you. - Just how was Uddo killed? - We're not sure. But still, he was killed before he was hung up. - Dig him up. Check again. (thudding) (eerie music) (thudding) Right. - Right. Okay. (groaning) (eerie music) (menacing music) - Chinese garrote. Hey, you. I want you to go and grab one of the Chinese and then string him up in public somewhere near the village. - But who? - Doesn't matter. Just as long as he's Chinese. That's all that counts. To act as a warning. That in the future, if any Japanese is harmed at all, then we'll seize one of the Chinese and kill him and then hang him up. (giggling) - You're right, sir. And I know just the one. Listen, lately young Sar Chung is always talking against the Japanese here. Also, there's that young brother of his. - That's enough! (cows mooing) (foreboding music) - That's Sar Chung, there. (cows mooing) - You, there. You kill Uddo? - I was out on my boat when he was killed. - But we have a witness here though. How about that? - Who's that? - I heard you many times telling your friends that Uddo oughta die. - Huh? And this bum's word is your evidence? And what if I did say that? I was right. He was a pig! - That right? That's enough evidence for me. (thudding) Kill him! (screaming) (fighting commotion) (yelling) (menacing music) (thudding) - [Announcer] Following information received, the villager, Sar Chung, was found to be guilty of murdering Japanese national, Mr. Uddo. He was therefore executed. His body had been ordered to hang in public for the next three days. Any person who tries to remove the body within this period will also be executed. (menacing music) - Hey. (chuckling) - Serves him right, huh? Doesn't it, huh? - Yeah. - The others are gonna be more careful in the future if they know what's good for them. - Shut up! - These local people can be unpredictable. It's quite possible that they'll try to get the body back. I better stay for awhile. - Well they might come in force, what then? - If they do, we'll kill them. Hey, you. And you. If they should make an attack on us in force, then you may have to use your swords on them. - Right. - We can't let him hang there. We've gotta get him. - No, no, no. Now look, that's what they want. Probably just what they're waiting for. I'm sure. I know that murderer, Taka. He's a mean swine. Be patient. Just wait now. Our time will come. - Huh? What's this? (ominous music) (thudding) (yelling) (groaning) (menacing music) (eerie music) (somber music) - You like it? - Yes, it's beautiful. - Yeah. It is nice. And it doesn't seem to have changed very much. See that pool there? I used to spend half my life their as a kid. - Hey! Hey! Now hold it now! You can't go in here. - Huh? (laughing) Well just who are you? And why can't we go in there? - Well, you see, it isn't safe. If you go there you'll get hurt. I'm only telling you for your own good now. (laughing) (shushing) Tell you something. The others will say that I'm mad. But I'm not though. (chuckling) - Well tell me then, what's happening there? - You see, they killed Sar Chung and then they hung his body up. Anyone that tries to take him down, they'll kill him. (laughing) (shushing) - If nobody dares cut him down, I'll do it. - You? You're not scared? - I'm not scared. - Really? - Really. - Oh, that's good! That's good, look, I'll help you with this. Right? (pleasant music) (ominous music) - I'll bet you nobody will come to get the body. They're too scared. - Yeah. (laughing) Huh? Who's this? - You see? That's Sar Chung's body, there. (ominous music) - My God, it's true. - And those guys are gonna kill you if you try to get him down. You sorry you promised to cut him down? If so, you don't have to. - Stay here, I'm going. - No. I'll go too if you'll let me. - Right. (ominous beat music) (yelling) (whooshing) (thudding) (yelling) (thudding) - Hold it! (dramatic music) - Hey, come on! (cheering) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - You know, you're really very lucky to get yourself a wife like this. (chuckling) - That's nice of you. And Chan's told me a great deal about you. He's told me how you brought him up and sent him to school and then finally gave him the money so that he could go to the States. (laughing) - Well, I think he deserved it. Nephew, now tell me how you got on in America. - Quite hard at first. Didn't know anyone. Couldn't even speak the language but then I developed some good contacts in the boxing world. - Oh and you did well too. Now then, how long will you be staying here? - A long time. I'm not going back there. - Oh and why not? Everybody tells me you were doing so well in the States. They say you could be world champion. - Yes, he could, but now he's decided he wants to leave the boxing world. That's why we're here, looking for a place to settle down. (chuckling) - Sure. I want some land to build a house. Not too big. Uncle Wong, I was hoping you'd help us. - Sure. A very good idea, you buying a house. And in the meantime, while you're looking around, you stay here. - Grandad. - Oh. Tow Chong, come here. Let me introduce your uncle and his wife. - Hello. Hello. - Oh my gosh, you have grown. You were a baby when I left. He's a man now. - Uncle Chan, you couldn't have come at a better time. You see, we need someone to train us. To teach us all how we can fight and then resist the Japanese. - Tow Chong, you're uncle's looking for a place to settle down and where he can I've a quiet life. He's not here to fight. - Maybe but I don't think he'll have any choice. The way things are, the Japs obviously intend to control all of China. Just look there in Shanghai. Next thing, we'll see their troops here in the village taking over our land. Who's gonna live peacefully then? There is no alternative. At some point or other, we'll have to fight. - All right. Your uncle and aunt must be very tired. You can discuss this some other time. (gulping) - Damn it, what came over you then?! Why'd you let that fellow get away with that, huh? Tell me! - I don't get it. We must've lost a lot of face there. - I felt we oughta be careful. He's something special. - Oh? - That should've been obvious the way he acted. And we've got too much at stake right now. So we'll play it cool. We've a job to do. And that's to raise money here. Only one thing's important. To keep control of the fishing junks. So then, I'm gonna be very careful how I deal with this guy. - That's all very well but what about the fisherman? They long follow him. He'll be their leader. (laughing) - Don't worry. I'll be seeing him again very soon, talk things over. Just to keep him sweet for the moment. Then when my plans are finally made, it won't matter what he does. (laughing) (pleasant music) - You see? Practically all the young men are out fishing and all the rest are repairing the nets. Hey, you know what? I'd like to go over there fishing myself. - Oh? And then maybe I can come with you. - Oh, I guess that you could. But you'll have to learn how to go barefoot. - Go barefoot? I can do that. - Oh? - Just watch. (pleasant music) Now look. (yelping) (laughing) - Put them back on. It's not so simple. It'll take quite awhile. Come on. (foreboding music) - It's them. - It's all right. - Huh. Where are you going? - Just a stroll. - Well, I'm afraid you can't. No way. This road's closed. - Well, you heard him. It's closed. - Whose orders? Who said so? - Doesn't really matter. If it's closed, we'll go some other way. Come on. - Now wait! Answer some questions before you go. - And if I don't? - You'll see. (laughing) - Right, ask them. - Where have you come from and what do you want? - I've been to the States and just come back. It's my home. I was born in this place. Now then, can I ask what you are doing here? - Huh? (giggling) - What of you? She wasn't born here, I'll bet you. Huh? No, sir, that's for sure. (smacking) Damn you! What'd you hit me for? (groaning) - You listen! Tell your boss I'm coming to have a talk with him and in the meantime, get lost! (whimpering) (ominous music) (fighting commotion) - Take a rest. (men groaning) - I hope that your uncle's gonna train us. Have you asked him? - I mentioned it. But I don't know. From what his wife says, seems he's not fighting now. - Really? Well that's a great pity. Still, we have to go ahead though. It's not that simple. Those Japs are much too strong for us. Right now we wouldn't have a hope in hell with them. Only one man can help us and that's my uncle. So let's hope he decides to do it. Wait! (whooshing) (whimpering) - It's me! Hey, hey, hey, it's just me. - All right, what do you want? (chuckling) - Get out of here, go on! - I want to stay. I want to train as well and learn some boxing. Then I can fight the Japs. (laughing) - Well, all right. We'll let you stay. But don't tell anyone. - I promise I won't tell anyone. - He's crazy. We just can't trust him. Nu uh, for sure. - Hey, hey, hey! That's not true. - We're wasting time. Come on, let's practice. (men chattering) (fighting commotion) (ominous music) - Come on, it's not too far. Huh? (laughing) There you are. How are you? (giggling) - Now come on, where are you fellas going to? (laughing) - Find girls. - My friend, he is very keen to try some Chinese girls. Can you get him one? - Sure I can. Anything for you. - [Man In Orange] But where? - Not far. In fact, right here. (hiccuping) Just look over there. (ominous music) - How's that? - Good. (giggling) - Well, all right. You fix it. - Well, of course. Sure I'll fix it. (hiccuping) (ominous music) - Well at least she oughta be clean. (laughing) - Here you are. Tell me, where's your father, huh? - Why do you ask? - The Japanese, over there, they wanna buy some fish. (laughing) - They'll have to wait until he comes back home. (ominous music) - Come on, come on, come on. - I'm going home! Let me go! - Just stay! Hey, come here! Hey! Come here! (laughing) - Let go! (foreboding music) Let go! Let go of me! Help! - Stop! - Leave me alone! Help! (thudding) - And who is this fella butting into our business? - His name's Lee Sun and he's her boyfriend. - Yeah and you better stop messing with our women or there's going to be trouble! - Seems to me that you Chinese are getting much too big for your boots. It's time you were taught a lesson. - Get him! (yelling) (whooshing) (thudding) (laughing) (whamming) (groaning) (moaning) (thudding) - Hold it. We don't want him to die yet. Let's take him back to the house. Pick him up. (dramatic music) (gasping) - Hey, listen! Lee Sun, the Japs have got him! - What? What? Young Lee? - Oh dear. What will his poor mother do now? God, I don't suppose he'll come away alive. - I'll go and get him. - And I'll go with you. - Right. (exciting music) - Hey! Nephew! For God's sake, be careful now, they're dangerous. (whamming) (whimpering) (splashing) - Ha. Huh? Chan Kwan's coming! (dramatic music) - All right. So what do you want here? - Release that boy! - And why? - And why are you holding him? He's done nothing. - There's no reason for us to tell you anything. - Shut up! Just keep your mouth closed. - He attacked this man here. Tried to murder him. - Well I don't believe a word of that. So you go ahead and cut him loose. - If you can take three blows from me, I'll let him go. - Huh? (laughing) - Chan Kwan, you better be careful because this gentlemen is said to be the top karate champion in Hokkaido. (ominous music) (whimpering) (dramatic music) - Right. Let's try it. Go on. - Huh? (cracking) (thudding) (thudding) (grunting) (thudding) - Chan Kwan. You promised. Go and release him. - Hold it! He may have promised you but I didn't. - Hold it! When a Japanese gives his word then he doesn't break it. All right now let that man go. I'm sorry. I arrived a little late. Still, it's all right now. One thing that I'm anxious to avoid is a serious misunderstanding. I mean, we should cooperate. It's quite peaceful here and we should both try to keep it that way. - Well, I've only just come back. So for the moment, I'll reserve judgment. But still, this is Chinese territory and I hope that you'll tell all your men to keep it in mind or else there will be trouble here. - Of course. And if something should crop up again, then I hope we can get together and settle the thing peacefully. (laughing) - Fine. Okay. We'll leave it like that. (ominous music) (whimpering) - How're you feeling? Looking a bit better I must say. - Fine, thanks. Are you all right? (laughing) - Me? Oh, I'm all right. - Well I'm proud of you. That was a brave thing taking all the punishment like you did. - Ah. It wasn't all that bad. - Uncle Chan, I admire what you did but it will only encourage the Japs. - Oh? - They won't even think you're tough. Oh no, all they'll see is that you backed down. - It was the only thing to do though. - Maybe it was but the fact remains. Nothing's been solved. I mean, we're just where we were. You saved him, I know that. But still, the same could happen tomorrow. How often can you do this? (somber music) - All right. What do you think oughta be done? - We're very poor here and that's our strength. There's not much here and the Japs know it. Now then, if we give them a lot of trouble, then they'll pull out. It won't be worth their while. - Maybe. But why not leave it to your uncle? He's had more experience. (dramatic music) - No. I think the boy is right. - Kuro? - [Kuro] Yeah? - How many of the fisherman still owe us tax? - At a guess, I would have said it's about 90 percent. Perhaps maybe more of them. - Why is that? - I guess it must be on account of the war. The fishermen are too scared to go out. Also, it's because the rate of taxes is more than they can afford to pay. - Well you tell them that they have until the end of the week to get the money. - But boss, I really don't think that they have the money. - Yeah, they seem to be in a bad way. - That's right. Last time we collected, my God, I thought they were all gonna riot. (chuckling) - If they can't pay then we can start confiscating their things. - But they've nothing worth seizing. - The junks! - If we take the junks then they can't go fishing and well never get the tax. - You idiot! Shut up! Why do you always have to argue? I know exactly what I'm doing. I've had orders. Our government wants those junks. Right? Junks! 500 junks! - All right, boss. What shall we do then? - Go on out and confiscate the junks. - Right. We'll start tomorrow. I'll tell the men. - Tomorrow? You idiot! Get out and start right away! - Right! (menacing music) - Okay, now we've got him! (thudding) (groaning) (chuckling) (swishing) (whamming) (groaning) - Why haven't you paid your taxes? (groaning) (yelling) (moaning) (menacing music) - Those Japs, they're going crazy now. This business with the taxes. I mean, it doesn't make any sense. They know that no one has the money to pay. - Well what do they want? - Don't know but we'll watch them. They're up to something. (waves sloshing) (whooshing) (foreboding music) (screaming) - What do you want with me? - To kill you! (whooshing) (smacking) (screaming) (groaning) (screaming) (banging) (groaning) (whooshing) (gagging) (chuckling) (menacing music) - Oh. Welcome, welcome. (chuckling) Nice to see you. A pleasant surprise. - You didn't know I'd come? Well that surprises me. (ominous music) Where'd all that blood come from? - Huh? Oh. You see some stray dogs attacked me back on the road. You mean you've got some complaint against me? - Your men have arrested the fishermen and taken their junk. What I want to know is who ordered this and just what their authority is? - Huh? First I've heard of this. I know nothing about this at all. - So you didn't know. - You there! - [Man] Sir. - Well, is this true? - I think it may have been Joe and Kojima. - Idiots! You go out and find them! And tell them to come here! - Right. (chuckling) - I'm sorry. I'm as concerned as you are to see that things run smoothly here and I can guarantee you there will be no repetition of this sort of thing in the future. (chuckling) - I don't care whose fault it is. But I'll tell you this. So long as I'm here in the village, this had better not happen again. I'm going. - See you again. Goodbye. Where's Kuro? - He's out arresting the fisherman. - [Thug] Go on! Go on! Move! Come on! - All right then. See that they're locked up. - [Thug] Right! Come on, move! - Huh? (ominous music) What do you want? - Been waiting for you! (laughing) (whooshing) (yelling) (swishing) (thudding) (crunching) (foreboding music) - Huh? What happened? Who you been fighting with? (groaning) - What happened? - He's been fighting, he's hurt. - Bring him in, hurry, come on. (swishing) - Hey boss! Hey boss! Kuro's dead! Somebody's murdered him! (ominous music) - Same mark. The same mark we found on Uddo. All right! You're gonna find this killer. I don't care what you do. Just make sur you bring me this killer. - [Men] Right! - Now wait! Put up a notice. No junk is to sail without my permission. (suspenseful music) (people yelling) (pleasant music) - How are you feeling now? - Not too bad. (menacing music) - Chan Kwan lives right here. - Oh? Search it! - Okay. (thudding) Come out! Come out! Come out! - So they've come. - [Thug] Open up! - I can handle them. - I won't let you. - [Thug] Open up! (pounding) - Your wound hasn't healed. (pounding) - Come on! Open it up! - Quick, we'll try and hide you. (thudding) - [Thug] Open this door! (pounding) Come on! Open the door! - In here. (pounding) - [Thug] Open this door! - Open it. - Right. (pounding) - All right then. Let's break it down! Oh. - What is it? - We want to search. - [Uncle] Well, we've got nothing to hide. - Right. - [Men] Right! - Hey! - Stop there! (foreboding music) - There's nobody around here. - Huh? - Now please leave! Go on! - Ah. So your husband not home. Huh? - Come on. (thudding) Huh? (ominous music) Check in there. - [Thug] Right. - Let's see what's hiding in there. (ominous music) (whimpering) - That's a stinking old hen! (laughing) - All right. (exciting music) - Go on! Go on! Hurry up! Go on! - What's happening with them? - They've been arrest and so what? - And what for? Let him go! - Ha! Not damn likely. - If that's how you want it. (thudding) (smacking) (swishing) (groaning) You let them go! (gagging) - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Let go! Let go! - Come on. - Oh, thank you, thank you. - That's all right, you better go home now. - Mr. Chan! Mr. Chan! The Japs! The Japs have been to your home! (suspenseful music) - We found them in hiding at Chan's. - Huh? I see. I guess it was you. (thudding) - Stop it! You better let us go before my husband comes for us. (chuckling) - I'm afraid that I'll be too busy to see him. - Hey boss, I think we should get rid of them. - No. Not yet. I intend to have some fun with them. Take them inside and lock them up. - Right. - Take them inside! (men chattering) (whimpering) - Koja. - Yeah? - There's something you've gotta do urgently. Take some men down to the key side and then set fire to all the junks you can. - Huh? But don't we need them? Well I've just received a signal in from Shanghai. Been a change of plan. It seems the army will be landing here shortly. So we'll burn the junks to be on the safe side. Now you go on and see to it. - Right. I'll go now. (suspenseful music) - Uncle Wong! You all right, Uncle Wong?! (gasping) - The Japs came in here. They took your wife and young Wong. Get them. Put an end to them once and for all. - Uncle Wong? Oh my God! Uncle Wong! (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Hey! Hey! Mr. Chan! Mr. Chan! - Tell me, seen my wife? Any idea where she is? - Yeah. - Come on, speak up! - Oh, sure, I seen her. Yesterday she gave me some supper to eat. - Idiot! I mean since then! - Hey! Hey! Don't go yet. I got some news. Important news. Must tell you. You must know. - I have no time! I've got to try and find my wife! - Listen. The Japanese, there's going to set fire to the junks. - That's right? - That's right. They said they'll burn them. Every single one of them. - That's right? - Yeah. That's why I left for you so you can come and stop them doing it. But still, I guess you want to find your wife first. (dramatic music) - No, I'll save the junk. It's more important. (suspenseful music) - So it's you, aye? What do you want? Guess you're trying to meddle again. - No, I just wanna kill you! - Huh? Get him! (yelling) (thudding) (yelling) (groaning) (yelling) (thudding) (swishing) (growling) (yelling) (swishing) (thudding) (groaning) (swishing) (yelling) (whooshing) (groaning) (ominous music) (somber music) - Now then, you're both gonna get what you've been asking for. It's your own fault for resisting the Japs. Now take me, I'm the smart one. You can see just how well they treat me. - Little rat! You shut your mouth! - Huh? Bite your tongue, you! When Taka gets back here, he's gonna kill you both. I promise you that and I'm gonna have a lot of pleasure watching him. - Lousy trader! You'll pay for this! - Listen, just ignore him. Chan Kwan will fix him. - Huh? Chan Kwan? (laughing) Yeah and just what makes you think he'll be coming here? Don't think he will. In fact, I'm quite sure. You see, Mr. Taka's ready and waiting for him now. But still, he's gonna be leaving a very pretty little widow behind and that's a terrible pity, huh? Huh? (laughing) Now then, you two, get out! Get out! (snickering) (ominous music) (laughing) - Let her go! You swine! You swine! (laughing) - So now then, we got the time. Let's see what you're like. - Let me go! - Stop it! You rat! (suspenseful music) Stop that! Leave her alone! (yelling) Chan Kwan's here! (thudding) - Damn you! I'll cut you to pieces. (thudding) (gagging) - Good one. - Undo me. (thudding) (yelling) - Right! (thudding) (groaning) - Quick, come on! (suspenseful music) - All right! Where have you got them? - Chan Kwan, I'm sorry I had to do it this way. I really have quite a lot of respect for you. I don't like doing it but I was forced to do it to stop you meddling. - Meddling? I tried to stop you killing my friends and robing the village blind and you call it meddling! - Now look, you're being naive now. I'll explain it to you. In exactly three days from now, the Japanese troops will be landing here. - Huh? - And that's why I had all the junks destroyed. Just in case they'd be used to resist the landing. - Sorry. That's how they will be used, I promise you that. - Ha. I don't think so, they're already destroyed. - Is that right? - I sent my best men down to do the job. (laughing) - They never got there. I stopped them. (foreboding music) - So you killed Koja? Well that's a great pity. But still, the game isn't finished yet. I've still got your wife. Listen, I'll release her unharmed if you leave here and get our of my hair. - You listen, you let her go and you get out of here and I'll see you get out of here alive. (laughing) I should leave here? Our troops are gonna be occupying the whole of this country within the next 12 months. And that's a fact.
