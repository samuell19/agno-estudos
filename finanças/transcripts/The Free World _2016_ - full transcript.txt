- Don't be scared. You gonna be okay. I know it don't feel like it right now. 'Cause all you feel is afraid. But you got me. You didn't used to, but you do now. See, I was where you was 67 days ago. Mm-hmm. They say it's bad to count, but.. You just get so used to it. Sometimes I wish I was back. I do. You'll see. You miss things. Things you never thought you'd miss. They say the prophet wouldn't want us talkin' like this. 'Cause you unclean. But I'm unclean, too. I think if he saw your suffering the way he saw mine.. I think he'd understand. He saw it and lifted it right up. You gonna be okay. Mm-hmm. Oh, I know. I know. - Mo, get me a cart! Beatin' up on helpless animals! That make you feel right? - Get outta my way. - That is a life! You hear me? That's a life. - It's a damn dog. I'm gonna tell you again to get out of my way before I move you. - So move me. I'm callin' the cops! - Yeah, what can we do for you? Oh, wait. Here comes the cavalry. Hey. I know you, boy? Hey, you're the cyclops. - Mo, just, get back inside. - Hey, hey. Come on back here. Both of you, come on. A little closer. Ah! You're him, alright. A free man. After all this time now. Tsk! It must really be something. Hmm. You know, you got a felon on the books here. You know that? - I do. But it ain't him. - Yeah. Innocent, my ass. I don't care what the courts say. You know, an innocent man he don't do the things that you did in lockup. - Can you, please, just leave us alone? - I've seen what you done to those little girls. I've seen the pictures. - He didn't do nothin'! - That's not what I heard. No, that's not what I heard. - Not gonna make it, mo. Beat up too bad. Punctured lung, internal bleeding. We gotta help him pass. - No, he gonna make it. He'll make it. - We'll give him the night. But if he's still suffering tomorrow we gotta put him down. - Sh-shh. We're here. - You okay? - No, I ain't. - Don't listen to nobody. Especially some good old boy with a badge. First couple months are hard. Gets easier. - Poor thing. You alone can forgive sins so Grant me forgiveness and mercy. Thank you for your call. You've reached Mohamed Lundy. Um, I'm outside right now. So, um, you can.. Hi. This is Mohamed. I'm, I'm, I'm not here, so you can leave your.. You have reached Mohamed, and he's not here right now. He's, um.. I bet you didn't sleep last night, huh? My first night was hard, too. Beat up. Scared of the noise. They say you make it through that first night and you can make it through any of 'em. They got no saying for when you get out, though. Hold on. Just.. Just hold on. Shh. It's okay. You're alright. - You're okay, baby. You're just tired. You're just tired. - Mohamed? It ain't right what he did to that dog. Every last one of 'em, i wanna break their damn necks. - Ain't no rules out here. Killed a helpless dog, ain't nobody does nothin'. - Things don't get settled the way they do on the inside! Give it time. Stuff starts to make more sense each day you're out. - We should bury him. - Disposal regulation. They'll give me hell. - Hey. Hey! Our drugs are locked up now. Go out the way you came. Ain't nobody got to know about this. Huh? - Charlie - you need help? Want me to call you somebody? - Ma'am? - Whoa! - Why won't you.. - Ma'am. Ma'am, now, there's a Van outside. I'll get you anywhere you need to go if you're in trouble. Hey, miss. Miss! You gotta, you gotta stop here. - You're gonna help me find him. - I can help you if you just.. - You have to help me find him. They didn't mean to. - They didn't mean to. - Hey, now. You're scaring me now. Don't.. Ma'am. Ma'am.. Hey. Hey, hey! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, ma'am. Ma'am, help me. Hey, ma'am. You alright? You alright? Help, somebody! Hey, I didn't.. Touch you, i didn't touch you. I didn't touch you. - The lady from the innocence project called this morning. Wanted to see how you're doin'. Said you're doin' fine. Workin' on your people skills. You know, it strikes me you don't seem too happy. To be out, I mean. Most folks would be doing backflips to have their names cleared like that. Be outta Angola. Breathin' fresh air like a real, live person. Bury the past. Or it'll bury you, boy. You hear? - How you doin', ma'am? Bismillah. Now, you need to put that knife down. - You stay away from me! Get outta my way! - I'm gonna let you leave now. You need to understand somethin' first. - Get outta my way! - No, you need to know.. Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me, listen. I didn't touch you. And you asked me to help you. Understand? You understand? Now listen.. - I'm not afraid of you! - You ain't gotta be afraid of me. No. - You get outta my way. - I, I, I will let you leave. - You get outta my way! - I'm gonna let you leave! But you, you need to know. I didn't hurt you. It's very important. - Who are you? - Nobody. Hang on. - You're one of them? You're one of his friends? Yeah? You're one of his friends who watched me? - Oh, we never met! - Who are you? - I work at the shelter. Yeah. Dog shelter. You brought in that mutt got beat up real bad? You know, in that pickup truck? Charlie. Charlie, his name.. - You, you know Charlie? - Yeah. That's, that's your dog. - I'm not, it's not happening. - Hey-hey-hey-hey. Lady, lady, stay with me now. No-no, I didn't watch you, i didn't watch you. Just calm down now. Now breathe. You get on. That sound good? Yeah? Alright. Alright. Alright, now. What's you name? You can tell me. It's alright, it's okay. - Doris. - Doris? Doris, I'm, I'm Mohamed. - We drove here? - That's right, we drove here. I didn't know if you was in trouble somebody's after you, but I, I just wanted to help you. You asked me to help you. - You didn't hurt me? - I didn't put a hand on you. - Then what do you want? - Nothin'. No. You want just some water? Get you some water. Yeah. Here you go. Here. Try it. It's alright, just take it. That's it. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Yeah? Feel better? Just breathe. Just breathe. - Police! Police! Open the door! Police, open up! Sir, we got some reports of a domestic disturbance. You wanna tell your wife or girlfriend or so forth to come to the door? - Oh, ain't nobody here but me, officer. - Oh, is that right? - Martin, right? - You two acquainted? - Don't you watch the news? - Will you open up a little bit? Holy shit. Yeah, Martin Lundy. Hey! You mind if we come in? - Yeah, you go on. - Is there someone else here, sir? - Like I said, there ain't no one but me. - Well, let's just make sure about that. - What's all the noise about, Martin? - I was exercisin'. - Going at it hard, huh? Shit. My lovely latina partner's gonna take a look around. Make sure you're not making lampshades outta ladies in a back room someplace. Doesn't look like you're big on lampshades, actually. The cyclops! The beast of Angola. You're a damn legend, son. Tore a lotta fellows up on the inside, huh? I heard even them gang-bangin' niggers wouldn't go near the cyclops. That's impressive. White as you are. Very impressive, Martin. - It's Mohamed. - You're a real movie of the week, aren't you, boy? You got an animal in there, Mr. Mohamed? - Yeah, it's a dog from the shelter. I'm workin' down there. - We're good. - You like dogs? - I'm allergic. - I love 'em. - Bring it out, let's see it. - I can't. She's sleepin' now. - Wake it up. Come on. - Come on, Eric. I'll be sneezin' all damn day. - No, she needs to sleep now. - I say, wake it up. - That's a sick dog right there. - Wake it up, boy! - She's an old dog, sir. She's sick. - Eric. You have a nice day, Mr. Lundy. - Ma'am. Come on. Come on, now. They're gone. - I was just making dinner. - I see. Now, come on out. Come on. - Thank you. - It's alright. - Mm, look at this. - Melanie? - Details are still unfolding, but police say they're dedicating all available resources.. - He was just here. - to the investigation of long's murder and the search for his wife. They do consider Doris long a person of interest and they're not ruling out the possibility that she could be a suspect. Or another potential victim. - Was she with him when he came? - Police say are devastated though by sergeant long's loss and they say he was very well liked... - god, I don't even know how. - We're following this story closely of course and will bring you live updates as more details become available. - Hope she's okay. - Live, here at the scene, Melanie hebert.. - Paperwork right there for you. - Mm-hmm. - I can't sleep. Just keep thinking about Charlie and... I just can't sleep. Did you just move in or something? Not a lot of furniture or anything. - Did you have enough of it? - I sure did. - Now, he's dead. - Do you want me to go? I can go. - I don't know. I don't know. - I still wake up and think I'm there. With the cracks in the ceiling. The footsteps. The heavy curtains. But I'm not. I'm here with these white walls. Where I can breathe. And there are no mistakes. Just relief. - Nobody wanted it. Give it a try. - Want me to sit in it? - Yeah! Go on. - Yeah, it's nice. Hey.. I wanted to ask about Charlie, my dog. Is he okay? Or did he... He probably didn't make it, did he? - Yeah, he's okay. - Really? Oh, that's great. That's good. I was really sure he wasn't gonna make it. Where's your dog? - Oh, it's just for dogs i bring home from the kennel. - Oh. That's nice. - You finished with this? - Sorry. It's my fault what happened to Charlie 'cause he was trying to protect me. - Ain't your fault. Your husband. I've known a lot of men like him. And they don't stop. - So, the bed in the closet, is that for a dog, too? - No, that's me, i don't really care too much for open spaces. - You sleep in the closet? - Yeah. - You fit in there? - Yeah. - Excuse me. I'll be right back. That's better than prison chow, huh? You know, I had one of those nutraloafs once on a dare. What you all call that inside? Confinement loaf? Woo! That's somethin' awful. You know, I always thought it was cruel and unusual to put all that mushy, wormy food together in a pile of shit and call that dinner. - What is it that you want? - What do I want? You don't wanna know what I want. What I would like is to ask you some questions about a dead cop. My boss said to leave you alone. He said that you been through enough. Yeah. He and i don't agree on much. I'll see you soon. - Why do you do that? - To be clean in front of god. Then I pray. - Sounds beautiful, the praying. - Thank you. - Did you grow up doing that? - Nah. I learned this in prison. - Why not Jesus? - Christians.. They always wanted me to confess somethin'. I didn't have nothin' to confess. Islam never asked that of me. - Islam. What does that mean? - It means surrender. - Why are you helping me? If I get caught, you go back to prison, right? - Probably, yeah. - Well, I don't want that to happen. So, I should go. - No, you can stay. You, you stay. - Okay. - My lord, please forgive me. Allahu akbar. Allahu akbar. Sorry. This... Bother you? - Mm-mm. You got me clothes. - Yeah. I don't know much about 'em. - It's perfect. - Good. I figured you gonna need 'em. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - If you wanna sleep in the closet, it's okay with me. - Are you sure about that? - Mm-hmm. - Appreciate it. - Mr. Lundy! You're a hard man to get on the phone. Yeah, you're a hard man to get, in general. Oh, it's not smart, puttin' your back on me. Should've learned that inside. - What's this? - Linda, right? - I don't have to tell you anything. - Not sure that's true. - This is a private business. Unless you got a warrant, or some reason to be here you ain't welcome. - You know why they call him cyclops? - Warrant. - Yeah, the Aryan brothers gave him that name when he took his cellmate's eye out. Said he kept it. 17 years old. Monsters don't grow up, Linda. They just hide in the closet until they get hungry. - You put a kid in that gladiator school with all them animals, what'd you expect? - Justice. - He's peaceful now. That's all that matters. - I'm just gonna poke around here and ask Mr. Lundy a few questions. I could come back with a warrant. - Mohamed's been through enough, is all. - I'm just doin' police work. - Be quick, real quick. - Boss said I could poke around a little. You really love that right to remain silent, huh? Oh, come on, Martin. You know I'm not goin' anywhere until we have a little chat. We could do that right here, or we could go down to the station. You know Doris long? - No. - Yeah, I didn't think so. Makes sense you don't know each other. The funny thing is, we lose her trail right around here after the night of the murder. Like someone was waitin' for her. That John. Oh, he was not well behaved. A bit of a hot head, nobody liked him. Someone a girl might wanna get rid of. Girl that felt trapped. No hope. No place to go. Friends always lookin' the other way. Probably lasts for years. Someone had to help her, right? Maybe someone who didn't like cops much. Somebody who put a prison guard in a coma for 2 months. Permanent brain damage. Now, you remember that, Martin? Hmm? Remember his name? Hmm? Remember? Hey, I'm talkin' to you! - That fucking pig starved me. - There you are. There you are. His name was Ronnie. That was his name. Ronnie. Anyway, we'll get all settled. We always do. - Hey. - Hmm. - You asleep? - No. - Who are you? - What? - I mean... - well, you wanna know why I got locked up? - No. No, I don't care about that. I just mean, I spend all day here surrounded by your things, and... I don't really know who you are. - I ain't no one. - Well, that's not true. I mean... You don't like furniture obviously. You work with dogs. You like to pray a lot. And you're nice to me. So, that makes you someone. Right? Don't you have any family? - I got a sister, I think. Somewhere in Alabama last time I heard. - Well, what's she like? - She can draw real good ever since she was really little. - Yeah? - That girl draw like it was takin' a picture. Draw a fence or whatever in front of her. And she'd hand it to me like it was a test. "Now, you do it." She'd hand it to me 'cause she knew I was gonna mess it up. I always messed it up. That was a long time ago. Long time. - I have a brother. His name is Darren. And he's what they call a "tree doctor." And he had this big book of different types of trees. And he would quiz me on them, too. He was always much smarter than me. And better looking. He's very handsome. Like a movie star. - Are we friends? - Sure. - I ain't never been been really good talkin' to women. They locked me up when I was 15 and had no practicing. Ain't never really had a chance. - I hope I'm gonna be okay. - You're gonna be okay. - Charlie? Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, here. - Are you okay, hon? - Mm-hmm. - You sure? - Thanks. I'm sorry. I got locked out. - Why are you outside? - I made a mistake. I... - Why are you outside? - I got locked out. I'm sorry. - Come on! - I made a mistake, mo. I'm sorry. Your neighbor. She's, she looked right at my face. - Why did you go outside? - I don't know, I don't know! I thought I saw Charlie. Okay? - What? I thought I saw him, but... I swear to god, I thought i saw him outside! - What? - I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I ruined it. I ruined it. I'm sorry. - The cops are at my work. Here, they're comin'. - It's okay. Okay. I'm gonna have to go. Because if they catch you here I know they'll put you back away. - Hold on. Hold on. - If they catch you here, they could take you back. - Listen to me. - And I don't want you to go back! - Listen. Listen, I ain't goin' back. And you're not gonna turn yourself in, okay? - I'm not? - No. No, no, no. I don't, I don't wanna go back. - I know! - I'm not talkin' about prison. I ain't sayin' that. I don't wanna go back. You understand? - Me neither. - Okay? Alright. Okay. I know somebody. I know somebody's gonna help us. - Okay. - Yeah? Go get your stuff. - Okay. - Go get your stuff. - Back up! Back up! How many with you? - Just her. - I saw somethin' in the trees. - It's just us. - As-salamu alaikum. - Wa-alaikum-salaam. You're a whole lot more paranoid than I remember. - You don't remember much. - You wanna put the gun down now? - More than anything, brother. More than anything. Come in. Mm-mm. No. Absolutely not. - I wouldn't ask you if... - if what? If you actually cared about protecting my way of life? - No. If I had other options. - You bring a murderer into my home and ask me to risk my life, my freedom! Not just sheltering her, but taking you across the border? Why not north? Most of that border is just a wire fence. - 'Cause they're gonna find us there, and you know that. I'm not askin' you to get us across. I'm just askin' you to get us to someone who can. - Who? - Those low riders from corpus christi. You did business with them. They move things. - Yeah. Heard those charmers did crispy black real bad. Cut him up like a fucking carrot cake. - It's just yard gossip, man. Low riders are punks. Brotherhood errand boys. You know that. - How you gonna pay 'em? Oh, I'm gonna pay 'em. - Look, I'm callin' in my favor right now. We can't make it across on our own. Too many people lookin' for us. - Why don't I just take you? - You been havin' much luck at the border these days? - Fair enough. Okay. - Okay? - Yeah, what? You want me to say it twice? - Yeah. - I don't know, man. It was his purity that I admired most. Livin' alone for all those years in caves? Cold-ass nights in the desert? Ah. Only ever wanting one thing. One thing. And riskin' dedicating his whole life to it. Like sisyphus. Rolling that fuckin' Boulder up the hill just to watch it roll back down. Drove me to tears, bro. You know in a way, wile e. Coyote taught me more about loss and righteousness, in a way that prison never could. But that fuckin' road runner. That stupid, ostrich-looking little piece of shit with that stupid smile and that noise. Always fucking with him. - I liked him! He was always happy, even though he was being chased by some maniac who always wanted to kill him. - Yeah, easy to be happy when you win all the time. - Surviving and winning aren't the same thing. - You got a smart one here. Hey. I heard from akasha. - No... - my, my brother-in-law said he, uh, came to Brooklyn lookin' for work or a girlfriend or some shit. - Is he still cross-eyed? - Who's akasha? - So, akasha, this poor fucker used to get in trouble with the screws all the time because they could never tell if he was lookin' at them or not. Drove 'em fuckin' apeshit. So, one day, to fuck with him me and a few brothers told him that if he got hit real hard, it might straighten out his eyes. And he's not too smart, so he believed it. Kid was fuckin' desperate. So, naturally, we told him to go get the cyclops to hit him because this motherfucker was a terror. I mean, aryans wouldn't even sneeze at him. - Khalil... - What? Come on. The past is the past. So, he goes up to this brother and starts shovin' him at chow, you know? And this was before brother Mohamed become brother Mohamed. When he was still breakin' bones like a fuckin' ogre in a kids story. - Khalil... - so, he starts shovin' him. And pushin' him around. And brother Mohamed just looks at him like an ant. Like less than an ant. Like a shit that an ant takes and looks at and is like "oh, that's a small-ass piece of fuckin' shit!" Whole place stops. But the cyclops does somethin' no one ever saw him do. He laughed. He fuckin' laughed. And this was huge. Ah, a huge moment. It was like seeing your dad cry or somethin'. Somethin' you never thought possible. He never did hit him. They almost became kind of friends, you know? And brothers started passin' him pages from the holy book. Tellin' him he didn't have to fight anymore. To surrender to the one and only. And just like that.. Cyclops was slain. Made a peaceful warrior by Allah. To friends. Old and new. It's a day's drive to the safe house. Tried to make it comfy for you back there, but it'll get bumpy. Shotgun in the back, if we hit any trouble. When you cross, these guys will take you to my connection. He'll pay 'em out and set you up somewhere with an umbrella in your drink. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Everybody. Stop thankin' me. Come on. Giddy-up! - Does he talk that much all the time? - Hmm! Yeah. He's kinda got the gift. - Mm-hmm. I used to have a friend who'd do that. We called her chicken. - Why? Chicken? - She was not a chicken. She used to tell everybody she was part gypsy. And she had these teeth that you could just see comin' from a mile away. She was always mouthin' off to the cops and get all us kids in trouble. - Mixin' it up, huh? - Uh-huh. Then we'd have to fight. I could fight. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Like you care. Before they'd lock me up, i used to worry about nothing. I never caused too much trouble. Just kept to myself. Just stole a couple cars, and run 'em till they run outta gas. Slept wherever. - Before you, there was nothing. It was all nothing. - This is it. Stay frosty. - Welcome to nowhere! Where nothin' is your business and nobody got no names. This is the precious cargo, huh? - You our guy? - I am the guy, amigo mio. And this is my personal liaison. He's a bit shy, as you can tell but he does know what he's doin'. As does everybody else out here. Come on. Let's get you all settled. You got a long drive, manana. We got us a live one, huh? - We ain't lookin' for trouble. - Oh, but you were sizing us up ever since you got outta that truck. Did math on us, too, didn't ya? How much we weigh? Can we handle our business? Look. We just move stuff around down here, man. That's all we do. None of us wanna go back to a penitentiary over bullshit. So why don't we all relax? And I invite you to be our guests. - You're good? - We're good. - Country's not really her genre. - We love those shows around here. - You see last week when they did disco? - Kind of a guilty pleasure. - Judges ate it up. Even, uh, what's her name? With the big ol', uh... With the hair? You gotta know who you are, as an artist. I mean, that's what they're, they're votin' on when, when America looks at 'em. They wanna know who that singer is. Where he or she's been. I wanna look into that person's eye and go "i know your story." I can relate. That's true. I mean, it's as simple as that. It's the difference between a winner and a loser. Honesty. - We reserved the honeymoon suite for you all. Just in case osama didn't lay it out for ya you're gonna stay with us tonight. And tomorrow we are gonna load you into the back of a truck that is headed to juarez. Where we are going to hand you off to some other nice folks that are gonna get you across to the safe house and then home to sunny Caracas. We got some agua. There's a working commode. Hell, you got all the comforts of home. See, when everybody plays nice, everybody gets what they want. We'll see you in the morning. - Doris. Doris. Ugh! No. No! Doris! Yaaah! - Yaaah! - Where is she? Where is she? - In the hatch. - Where is the hatch? - Neon sign, neon sign! - Gimme the keys. Argh! Help me. Oh, fuck. - Okay. It's okay. - You okay? - It's okay. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Okay. Aagh! - It's okay. Come on, come on. Look at me, look at me. Okay? Look at me, look at me. Mo? Mo, you okay? Mo, you okay? You okay? - Just listen. That was me. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - That was me there. I'm sorry that was.. That was me. I'm sorry. - I know. I know, I know. It's okay. It's okay. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. We're okay. Okay. Okay, okay. - How fast was I goin'? - Shit. - No, no, no! - Shit, shit, shit, shit. Hey, we can't stop. We can't stop. Listen to me. - Why was I goin' so fast? - Listen to me. We can't stop. Okay, listen to me, listen to me! We can't stop. Look at us. We can't stop. Okay? - You two in the minivan! Pull over to the right... - it's one car. Don't stop. Okay? - Okay. - We're not gonna stop. - Alright. - We can do it. Okay? I'm right here. - Alright. - We're gonna go. Okay? - Yeah, yeah. Hold on! Go! - We can do it. We're gonna make it! You can make it! Don't stop! Don't you stop. Don't you stop. It's okay, it's okay. We just got to make it through. Okay. - Alright. Come on! Come on. Come on. - You in the blue minivan, get out of the Van! - No, no, no, no, no! We gonna run! We gonna run. You realize, you gotta run as fast as you can. - No, they'll shoot you. No. - Get out of there, right now! - They'll shoot you. I'm not gonna let them take you. - No, they ain't gonna shoot me. Don't worry now. Just two cops. Okay? Ain't gonna do that. I'm gonna find you. - How? - I'll find you. You know that. I'll find you. Okay? Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? Alright. You ready? - I'm ready. - He's not getting out. - This is your last warning. Out of the minivan! - Okay. - Okay. - One, two, three. - She's going.. Get out of the Van and get on the ground! - She's my hostage. I'm lettin' her go. I stabbed him. She didn't have nothin' to do with it. - Get on the fucking ground! - I stabbed him. - What just happened? - I killed him. It's, it was me. - Look, man. Get on the ground. Nobody has to die today. - He's got bracelets on, man. - You hear me? Huh? - I surrender. I surrender to you. I surrender to you. I surrender everything to you. - No. - Fuck! - Mohamed! I can't seem to get used to that big clunk when the doors lock up. And all the night noise starts. But there's this little patch of sky out my window, and I can see clouds moving along. Off to someplace that isn't here. Someplace bigger, where they got more room to do what they do. Clouds things, I guess. When I think of you, it takes me away from here. Out past the place where the clouds get off to. All I have to do is just think about your face. And I'm out in the free world. Pressing up against the walls of our little closet. And we're there, together. Where things don't echo all the time. I think of you. I think of you. I think of you. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. You get my letter? - Yeah. Even tried to write you back but... Just came out wrong. - It's okay. - Hmm. - You should keep tryin' though. Is that a new shirt? - Yeah. - I guess I sort of stole your look, huh? - Are you okay? You make any friends? - Yeah, some. You know, there's some good people here. I hear the lawyer's gonna get you a really good deal. - Yeah, Vicky's... She real smart. She always smell like coconut, though. Aw, you shouldn't be in here. - I took a life, Mohamed. Wasn't mine to take. - How's our place? - Uh... It's empty again. - Hey, you should get a dog. - I miss you so much. - I miss you, too. Come on. Give me your head. Do you feel my hand? - Yeah. - Yeah? You feel it? - I do. You have me. You didn't before, but you do now. - I do now.
