MAN: (ON RADIO) In Washington today, Attorney General William Fred Smith -hinted that a federal grand jury... -Oh, I'm late. (SIGHS) (TIRES SQUEALING) (SIREN WAILING) (HORN BLARING) BILLY: Bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang. Bang, bang. -Billy. Billy! -Bang, bang. Oh! Kids. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) Cowboys. (DOG BARKING) Okay, Ike Clanton, I'm coming in to get ya. -Bang, bang, bang. -Ow! Oh, wait a second. That's completely out of character. Doc Holliday was not a back shooter. You have the front covered. Listen, if you're not gonna play fair I'm gonna dabble your face out. BILLY: Oh, no. Okay, children, it's time for the real world. Yeah. Well, don't bother packing a lunch for me. I'm just going to eat some of this kid's head. -Oh, no! Don't. -(GROWLING) Sometimes I do not know which one of you is the eight-year-old. He is. (LAUGHING) Come on, partner, the stagecoach is waiting. The stagecoach needs a tune up. -No horsepower, huh? -Oh, please, stop. Daddy, I wanna go to your school today. I think you're a little young to go to college, son. Through the window, Dad. -Through the window, pal. -Ah. Here's your school report. Very good. Why would any kid who knows as much about the Old West as you, choose to write about the zoo? Let's teach him to open car doors first before we move on to the more difficult things. Okay. Give us a kiss and you got a deal. Okay. See you later guys. Yeah. LAURIE: Don't take too much time oiling your gun, partner. Bye, Dad. (TOY GUN FIRING) (SIREN WAILING AT A DISTANCE) (SIRENS WAILING) (HORNS BLARING) Hold on, Billy! (SIRENS WAILING) SCOTT: No, God. Laurie. -Sir, no. -Get back. Come on. Come on. (GUNSHOTS) (GUN CONTINUES FIRING) I don't believe it, every single day for an entire year. Scotty. Hey, Joe. What do you say? Ah, democracy is safe in any way. Listen, thought we can ride in together. Ride in? Oh, Scotty, you forgot about the auction. -The auction. Is it 4:30 already? -Uh-huh. Why don't you guys go on ahead and I'll get my stuff and come right behind you? Well, look, actually, Scotty, I thought maybe we could go in together then after the auction we could meet up with Betty and a friend of hers, meet them for a drink. Gee, I can't tonight, Joe, I got term papers. Well, look, why don't you ride with me anyway? Then my driver will take you back in. Okay. Let me just go in and get my coat. (DOOR OPENING) ♪ ♪ You think they'll just let us camp out here? Like kids in a candy store, huh? I see what I like. Oh, yeah, put up by a Texas John Cody. -So it must be real. -Absolutely. Oh, it comes with a set. So, with tintypes, handbills and other Western Bric-a-brac. Hmm. Yeah. Just the... Just your kind of thing, huh, Scotty? My type of thing too, you know, she would be ashamed for us to bid it up between us. Hey, what do you say? I'll do the bidding and if we get it we'll split 50-50. We'll each take a trunk. All right. I'll take this one. Got yourself a deal, partner. This got a hole. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? We're going to start the auction very soon. Would you all be seated and be sure you have a bidding number. We cannot honor any bids without a bidding number. Thank you very much. And logically enough, we're going to start this auction with lot one. Lot one consists of a knife, a special knife. This knife was made popular in the style of Jim Bowie. As you can see, it has a very large steel blade, probably used for skinning buffalo and many other nefarious purposes. However, a long time ago someone took the time and trouble to repair the handle of this knife replacing it with a piece of buffalo hide. In my mind, that deems it as an authentic, so I'd like to have an opening bid please, of $500. (PLAYING HARMONICA) (METAL CLANKING) (HORSE SNORTING) Hey, you're new to these parts? Men don't step down around here unless if he's invited. Yes. I forgot. I guess the smell of that coffee there is taking my manners. Okay. I'm obliged. I ain't familiar with that accent, though. Your boys running your cattle down to Tucson? We don't have to run them that far anymore. Railroads been here since 1880. Where might you be headed? Ah, I'm not sure. I'm looking for a man. A gunslinger who has a pair of 45s. Like ebony handles each with a silver star. Have you seen anyone like that? -Are you the law? -COLE: No, have you seen him? -Seems to be a... -No. Can't say as we have. You ran out of coffee? What was his name? Who? (GROANING) -Ahh! -What was his name? The guns are all I remember. Ebony handles, silver stars just like you said. It was back in... (GRUNTS) Crossfire. Crossfire was the name of the town. Unless your raise is as fast as my bullet, I wouldn't try it. 1580 shaving implements sold to number 16. Number 16. Now, we move to Lot 27. Lot 27 consists of two trunks. One is leather and one is tin. Containing... Well, let's see, what one contains. Well, we have old tintypes, old tintypes, some old papers, also a bottle of old red wine. Empty, I'm sorry to say. However, this has contained a lot of nostalgia, a lot of history in its age. Now, look over here, you'll see, what appears to be a bullet hole. Now, can I get an opening bid please of... ♪ ♪ MAN: My, lady. ♪ ♪ MAN: I'll raise you. Give me whiskey. (BOTTLES CLINKING) I'm looking for a man. He has a pair of 45s. Like ebony handles with silver star. I'm not the law. Of course, you ain't. Law don't show up in this town. Not if they know what's good for them. We ain't seen nobody like that around here. Ebony and silver stars? A bit fancy for this town. Like these clothes you're wearing, fancy. From back east, right? Yeah. I'm afraid, in a ways. You're a liar. Ain't no more in the days does on. How did you get here, mister? I, uh... We, uh, took a train from Tucson. You're a double liar. Ain't been no train through here in two days. We've seen your type before, mister. Easters chasing an easy buck, carpet beggars, bounty hunters. Now, I wonder, which one of them is you. I ain't got no ebony and silver stars. Just plain wood. Five notches. You must be pretty good. I'm the best there is. I believe you. That's what your mouth says, mister, but your eyes say something different. Boys. (HORSE NEIGHING) If you like what it done to the trunk, you'll just love the neat little hole that'll leaving your head? (LAUGHING) Yeah. Good, good. (CLEARING THROAT) No, no, no, no, no. The paper wants this clear. I can't have all these people here. Now, listen I'm the town mayor too and I have a perfect right to be involved in this... I don't care who you are. You can be in the next one. You can all be in the next one but I got to have a clear shot. Now, if you all just step aside I'll get this done. Not ready. Mr. Mayor, give me some room, would you? Back off, fellows. All ready. 190, who's going to bid 200? And sold to Dr. McKenzie. $200. Thank you. Well, let's go divide the spoils, me son. Okay. I'm looking for a gunslinger. (CHUCKLES) Plenty of men like that around here. Now, three less, thanks to you. He wears a pair of 45s. Black ebony handles with a silver star. Have you seen somebody like him? Silver stars? No, I ain't see any. How about a military escort coming this way? Through Crossfire? No. You know a river around here winding like a snake? That'd be Old Rattler. A few miles away from here. -Which direction is that? -North. Say, this guy with the silver stars, who is he? What's his name? That's what I'm here for to find out. Well, see, if you... If you're going to be traveling maybe I can interest you in a pair of shoes. Professor, the general is expecting you. Thanks, sergeant. Yeah, that's all you had in that big trunk you bought, hmm? No. There are some other things. Some, uh, leather and some skins and papers but that's pretty much the best of it. Well, it looks like I finally got it over you, Scotty. I got a pick at that bag, original Mexican pinwheel spurs silver and brass inscribed in stamps. (CHUCKLES) Original buckles too. What now, why do you want these blown up anyway, huh? Buddy, they look just... Just humor me, will ya? Come on. Oh, well, fine, Scotty. Fine. But listen, afterwards, I'll show you my original Mexican spurs. -Hey, could I wear them? -Oh, well, they're antiques, Scott. Well, but then again, so are you. Well, you find, what you're looking for? Can you isolate and bring up that guy in the background? Karen's got a sister. You remember Karen, right? The red hair I've been dating? Got a sister, quite a looker too. I thought maybe next Saturday night we could, ah, double date. Thanks, Joe, but no thanks. Can we get a little like closer on the gun? Scotty, look, I know how hard it hit you. I really do know but you got to start picking up the pieces. How about focusing in just on the gun? Listen, Joe, I appreciate what you're trying to do for me but really, I'm happy as I am. -Oh, yeah. -Just a close up on the gun. Sure, you're happy? Look, Scott, when a hobby starts becoming a lifestyle, it's time to hit the old psychiatrist couch. I think I've been had. It looks like a 357. It's exactly what it is. It's a .357 Magnum circa 1980. No. No, it can't be. No, that's impossible, Scotty. No, it isn't. Look at the Bennett barrel. You got the swing out cylinder. -Well, maybe but... -There's no maybes about it. That's a 357 Magnum, a modern weapon. Can I have a copy of these pictures, please? There's something wrong here, Joe. I think I've been had. If you've been had, then, how about my spurs? The damn thing is clearly marked 1886 and I'd say that was just about right. There's no way you could have made a mistake? Scott, you're asking me thorough and I was. I gave it the full works. Chemical test, spectroscopy. This tintype is at least 100 years old, no doubt. What's the problem? Look at the gun in that fellow's hand. Yes? Suppose I were to tell you that it was a 357 Magnum Revolver made in 1980. Scott, you could tell me that with an ice cream cone and I wouldn't know the difference. What I do know is that this tintype is at least 100 years old. (THUNDER CRASHING) SCOTT: Philosophers and sciences for centuries including Einstein have given us data which indicates that time itself, one day might be manipulated. Now, we've explored the possibility of an advancement in weaponry in 1886 remaining undetected and unexploited but we've discounted that as an impossibility. I promised you that today would be a departure. I think the way I explained it was we would have a mystery in history. Now... (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) -(LAUGHTER) -(WHIRRING CONTINUES) Definitely we had a mystery in history. (CLASS LAUGHING) Next time, I give a History class remind me not to do it in the physics building. (CLASS LAUGHING) You all have those folders in front of you that you've read containing my thesis. Are there any comments? Are there any questions? Should I interpret this as an odd science? Okay. Professor, you're joking, right? I mean you got to be joking. (LAUGHING) No. Time travel? (CHUCKLES) What is this, like April Fool's Day, just the late? That's very funny, Frank. Are there any serious questions? Yeah, can you take me back to last Saturday night? Please don't. You're going somewhere, Mr. Statman? Professor, with all due respect, the hour is up. It's hard enough getting through the paper itself if we're not going to sit here and analyze it. I got other classes to worry about. I would have thought you'd been more receptive. Receptive to logic, professor. All right. That's it for today. Hey prof, for tomorrow? -Or yesterday. -Or last year? That's very funny. It's a shame they don't give credits in cynicism. (GUNSHOT) Perhaps I should have knocked. Who are you? My name is Georgia, Georgia Crawford. What can I do for you? I've come a long way to see you, Professor McKenzie. I've read your position paper. You and I are doing research along similar lines. Is that so? You gonna draw on me? (CHUCKLES) Of course not. I'd like to see the actual tintype, please. What tintype? The one you have projected for your class. Why do you want to see it? I am someone who shares your obsession with the Old West. I'm fascinated with your thesis. I need to use some of your research to balance my own. Professor McKenzie, I believe you. You're from the east, right? Sorry? I know a little bit about accents. You're from the east, right? Right. Yes, east. You ran the usual tests? Mmm-hmm. Spectroscopic, particle delineation, fiber examination. That was a waste of time. I beg your pardon? Oh, well, the tintype is obviously authentic. Here, look at these shadows. What about them? Well, contemporary camera always puts the flash next to the lens but in those days they held the flash pan this high which would tend to force shorten shadows, see? You didn't notice that? Of course, I noticed that, Ms. Crawford. I have those pictures memorized. The shadow is obviously forced short. Good, then we're thought paralleled. You bet we are. Have you established where the photograph was taken? Not yet. And that's the next step. Ms. Crawford, do you have any idea how many towns across the Old West blew up and disappeared overnight? Yes, I do, but what can you tell me about this town from this photograph? Well, for one, it was well established because it had a photographer which means it had a newspaper which tells me this was not a whistle stop. Very impressive, professor. It's a small wonder you were considered one of the world's great authorities. Were? Well, that's what they'll be saying, won't they? Now, these mountains won't have change, so if we could line this photograph up with the actual mountain... Ridiculous. That would take months. Time is relative, professor. You should know that. Do you have a room that I could change in? We might as well get started. Take your pick. Thanks. -(MEN TALKING AT A DISTANCE) -(WOMEN LAUGHING) WOMAN: Come on. Let's go, guys. Jack, come on. Get it, Jack. Okay. Well, I'm going to get this one too. Whoa! (WOMEN LAUGHING) I'm coming Jack. Whoa! JACK: Yeah! Oh, yeah! Whoa! (LAUGHTER) (MACHINE BEEPING) WOMAN: What did you say? WOMAN 2: I say you got enough. Yeah, you'd say no damn thing. (LAUGHING) -(GUN FIRING) -(SCREAMING) BART: I said nobody was to leave camp. WOMAN: We ain't part of your band. BART: You get paid to do what you are told. WOMAN: We got to wash too, you know. What we got to do is rob a stage. And we got to be ready to do that when it gets here. Oh, Bart, that ain't due until... It's due when it gets here. Maybe they make up some time. You know, you are caught out in the open like a bunch of halfwits. Now, get out of that creek. The Pulmari River is affectionately known as Ol' Rattler. Once an important watering place for lieutenant hideouts for outlaw gangs. -GEORGIA: Why are we stopping? -Because I'm tired. I've driven these roads dozens of times. I'm telling you, this is a waste of time. All right. Don't crank yourself up into a massive defense mode. I am not in a defense mode whatever the hell that is. Okay. Suppose we do find the right town. What's it gonna prove, 100 years after the fact? I can't believe that a fellow historian is questioning the validity of an objectively verifiable first step. Okay. What's the next town? (SIGHS) Crossfire. Oh, yeah. They tried refurbishing that town a couple of years ago. I know the only thing you're going to find there is an ex tourist trap. (SIGHS) We still have to check it. It won't take so long. I'll just turn on your music device. That's the ash tray. You used to be able to bring your whole family here. Professor, I think we got something. This is it. Crossfire! Put it there, partner. I don't know whether you're clever or just plain lucky? How about both? It happened right there in 1886. Okay. Let's split up and see what we can find. I'll take this part of town and you check out that end. Okay. I guess I should congratulate you on your deter... (MACHINE BEEPING) (METAL CLANKING) Where the devil did you spring from? I was just standing right here, mister. Well, you sure scared me. You got some Indian blood in you or something? You sure walk soft. Well, I'm looking for a man. Oh, hell. Everybody looking for somebody today. This ain't no damn information bureau. This is really important to me. He's a... He's about my size. He's got white hair and long coat. He's a foreigner. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen him. He was here a while go. I sure hope you're a friend of his. -Where did he go? -I don't know. He asked me about Ol' Rattler and he just took off. You know, the Riddler. Much obliged, mister. BILLY: What's this for, dad? Well, sheriff, in the old days when the bad guys went in the saloon to have a drink, this is where they hung their kids out to dry. (LAUGHING) Is that true, mom? No. This is where little boys fall off and break their heads. (ALL LAUGHING) Hmm. LAURIE: Okay sheriff. Time for your, what? -Bath. -Yeah. Oh, daddy, save me. Save me, daddy. (HORSE NEIGHING) Crawford. Crawford? (WHOOSHING) (MACHINE BEEPING) Hey, lady. What's going on here? I suppose you're as ready as you're ever going to be. (SIGHS) I am living proof that you are not crazy, Professor McKenzie. I'm a flesh and blood human being with one interesting quirk. I was born 600 years from now. 600 years? I've come all the way from 2586. 2586? I'm one of your time travelers. One of my time travelers? How many of you are there? (MACHINE BEEPING) I need to understand all this. In this skeptical century I thought you were the one guy who could understand. Look, you are halfway there already. Look at your own thesis. -Yes, it's a little naive... -Naive? -Well, you're a beginner but... -Wait a minute. Professor, I came back through time to find you because I thought you could help me. Now, I know you can that's why I came back just now. What do you mean? Where have you been? -1886. -1886? I took a horse ride from this spot down to the river. 100 years ago, it was called the Ol' Rattler and that's where I was. You're talking casually about traveling over 100 years to a guy who gets totally confused during rush hour. Well, I didn't expect you not to be shocked but I did expect you to get over it as soon as you can because I need your help. I need your mind, your books and any scrap of information we can find about this town as soon as possible. (MACHINE BEEPING) The world 600 years from now isn't perfect, but we haven't had a war in over 80 years. Well, why are you here? To find Joseph Cole. And who is he? The man in your tintype. Oh, silly question. You've comeback to find a man in my tintype. Now, why didn't I think of that? Dr. Joseph Cole, a brilliant ambitious man and very, very dangerous. Cole is one of our most prominent scientist. He's a physicist, microbiologist. He's even got a degree in history like you. Why is he so dangerous? That peaceful world of mine, well, it's a pretty tenuous and fragile thing. Irresponsible scientist brought us to the brink, so in my world, scientists are monitored and restrained. And the architect of that restraint is my father, Matthew Crawford. He works out of Washington. And Cole worked for and with him. Together they made the greatest breakthrough since man split the atom, a machine to conquer time. That's when it all started. Listen to me Cole, this device isn't ours. It and all of our research belong to the federation. Now, we've just reinvented the wheel. -Be proud of that. -I am proud, Crawford. That's the pride of ownership. Ownership is an antiquated concept. My family! I got my blood into this. And now I have it, look. Right in the palm of my hand, time! We can go back to the past and change it as we wish. Joseph, as your friend and colleague, I'm going to pretend I've never heard you say this. Then I'll say it again! You are my partner! You don't dictate what I do! Are you through? I don't know. I don't know what came over me. I'm sorry. (MACHINE BEEPING) 15 years on one project and not being able to proceed further. Maybe one day we would be allowed to do it. Not while I'm elected controller of this bureau. It's been this way for years, Cole. You know that. Since my father was here and his father. Yeah, and his father and his father and his father. I know that. I worked for you. And thinking of changing your decision, are you, Joseph? Oh, don't worry. Doesn't change a thing. Congratulations, doctor. GEORGIA: We should have known then, should have been alerted. Cole was not the kind of man to give up so easily. Yes, Michael? I just got a call from district five, sir about two blocks from Dr. Cole's residence. What's the problem? There's a power overload reading from that residence, sir. And it appears that the time crystal is missing. -Are you positive? -Yes, sir. Then please investigate immediately. And Michael, Cole is licensed to collect antique weapons. Be careful. Don't go alone. Yes, sir. You stole the time crystal, didn't you? And those clothes, you are about to... Turn around. Sergeant. GEORGIA: That was it. Cole escaped in time, literally to 1886. So how did you get to me? Your thesis, the one you tried to deliver. No. Yes. It still exists 600 years later preserved by laser. You're kidding me. (LAUGHING) No kidding. A dozen pages of concerned argument on how it was possible for a man to be photographed holding a Magnum pistol in 1886. -Wow. -It was too good a lead to pass up. -Why you? Why not a cop? -A cop? Police. Person Investigator. (SIGHS) My father and I developed the new time machine. We were the only ones that knew how to use it. He's a public figure, he would be missed, and training somebody new was out of the question, so here I am. Why would Cole go back to 1886? Exactly. Why? To change history. That's what I'm afraid of. Hey, Jack. You don't have a shot to western movie, run in a long time. So I'd take off the white coat if I was you. Heading for the next village, mister? Village? (LAUGHING) Oh, what the hell? Hop in. You know where I can find a small two-seated vehicle around here? There's lots of cars like that, mister. The one I'm looking for is white and black. The insignia says... Insignia? You mean the license plate. Yeah, the license plate. The license plate says, FSTDRAW. Yeah, sure. I know that car. What a pain that thing is to fix. It belongs to that crazy professor at the university over in Central. -Central, eh? -Yeah, central. (TIRES SQUEALING) Thanks for the lift, mister. Presumably, Cole went to Crossfire for a reason whatever he has planned has something to do with Crossfire. That's right. Then why not go back again if you're absolutely certain... I am certain. And in July of 1886, the date on your tintype, he didn't just pick that up out of the stratosphere. He was prepared. He was dressed for it. Besides the blacksmith verified he'd been in the area. Well, then? July is a whole month. Yes, I could go back and I could sit and wait around from July 1st to July 31st and supposed I'm across town whenever it happens, whenever it is or maybe I'm across the street. I have to pinpoint the exact date or I'll miss it. I got a friend who can help us. Texas John Cody. Well, he doesn't know about the West, never happened. Hey, mister. How about doing us both a favor and moving your vehicle before I have to give you a ticket? Sure, I'm sorry. Oh, I wonder if you could tell me the direction to the university. Yeah, go down about two stoplights, make your first left, second stop sign, make a right. It's about half a mile down the road. Can't miss it. Well, now we get to the good part. What do you think of this, Missy? This room bores the pants off of most women. That's a risk I'll have to take. Nah, I'd say, dude, do you want to share a little spider ride with me? -GEORGIA: Yes, please. -SCOTT: No, thanks. Ah, all right. Oh. Ah! Ah, neat. Neat, please. Yeah, neat, uh-huh. Cheers. Quite bracing. Yes, bracing. Uh-huh. Could I have another? Right. Well, a bird can't fly on one wing, can it? (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, why don't we, uh... Why don't we go see if we can find something at Crossfire? Ah, yeah, the Crossfire, it's a very good idea. Mmm-hmm. -Yes, indeed. -Mmm-hmm. Step into the office here. (EXCLAIMS) Let's see what we've got. (WHIRRING) (GRUNTS) Hmm, let's see here. Crossfire. Well... (CLEARS THROAT) No Crossfire. How about, uh, Ol' Rattler? Ol' Rattler. Ah, might've got lucky. You know how many people can read and write in those days? Not many. If you can write your own name, likely, they'd make you the judge. (TEXAS JOHN CHUCKLES) They could sing, though. Yep. And their songs were like their history books. You know, they pass them down from generation to generation. And I got the greatest collection of Western songs in the world. It's been in all... All on tape. Cross file now. Yeah. Well... Looks like what I fed into that machine, we got two possibilities. (MUSIC PLAYING) It's not any help. There aren't any words. You noticed that, huh? -(CACKLES) -Bright too, isn't she? Go easy on her. TEXAS JOHN: Okay, I told you there were two possibilities so we try the other one, huh? Keep shirts on. (MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) Well, I can give you a tape and a transcript if it'll help. Yeah, that'd be great, John. Hmm. Oh, legends handed down. They're most likely distorted, exaggerated over the years, but I've always found there's a grain of truth in it somehow. Here you go. I think it does. Thanks, John. -Good. Good. -Thank you, Cody. Yeah, come back sometime we'll arm wrestle, huh? -(CHUCKLES) -If you can handle a defeat. Well, yeah. God, I wonder where he found her. (SIGHS) The star-handled stranger. Why star-handled? Well, a handle in those days was a person's name. I don't know. Who are the blue boys he saved? The army. Right, cavalry. That could be. What would they be doing there in 1886? Indian wars were long gone. Escort duty. GEORGIA: Escorting what? Consignment of guns, gold? People or person. That'd be one heck of a person though to get the army to escort. Like who? The president. Who's president in 1886? -Grover Cleveland. -Good work. I'm a history teacher. I went through documentation there wasn't anything there. It would have had to been a secret mission. -Yeah. -Possible? Very possible. SCOTT: We know that nothing lastingly harmful happened to the president during that year. So you think we're barking down the wrong tree. I don't know. You think Cole could have heard that song? Possible. Cody bequeathed his entire collection to the Smithsonian before he died. Sorry. Brodsky, Joe Brodsky. Texas John knows everything you need to know about the West but Brodsky knows everything you need to know about the cavalry. Great. He's been collecting stuff about the army for years. He's got letters, memorabilia, everything. Why don't we stop and call him? Yes, sir. SCOTT: I need everything you have on the cavalry. What's the big deal here, Scott? Especially during the summer of 1886 in and around Crossfire. ♪ ♪ I need this stuff fast, Joe, so pull out all the stops. What's this all about, Scotty? SCOTT: A girl. A girl? Well, why didn't you say, buddy? That's good news. You know, I've been telling you to loosen up and find yourself a nice, ordinary girl. Just call me Joe "Cupid" Brodsky. Well, she's a little old fashioned but, you know, you can't have everything. Listen, give me a call as soon as you find something, okay? Oh. Are you hungry? I was until we walked in here. You must know there are 1000 things that I want to ask you about. What, it was like 600 years from now. (SIGHS) The more time I spend around you, the less I think I know. Well, if you were around in my time or even my great granddaddy's time, you would have heard the Crawfords. My father, Matthew, was one of the innovators of the present socioeconomic system and I think that... Hello? Matthew Crawford. What if Cole came back to set off a chain of events that would eventually destroy the one man who stood in his way? My father. (BELLS CHIMING) President Cleveland had a secret adviser, a mysterious man behind every important decision. Matthew Crawford, your father's name, second ancestor. And he's on that stagecoach. Exactly. The president. That explains the escort, the secrecy, everything. Now, if Cole kills him... He hasn't any children yet that would mean there'd be no more Crawfords. No father, no long family line. No me. Exactly. ♪ ♪ We have to pinpoint that gate. (DOORBELL RINGING) (DOORBELL CONTINUES RINGING) (TELEPHONE RINGING) SCOTT: (OVER VOICEMAIL) Hi, I'm on the stage between Tombstone and Darkwood if you leave a message at the tone, I'll get back to you. (MACHINE BEEPS) BRODSKY: Scotty, calling in sooner than expected, huh? Well, I've gotten lucky. Ran down what I think you're after. Cavalry around the Crossfire area. Well, there's a mountain of material here and it goes deep so you're going to have to tell me. MAN: We're ready for you, General Brodsky. BRODSKY: Yeah, yeah, hold your water, will you? Anyway, Scott, I made the usual copy. Do you want me to mail it or will you collect it? MAN: Sir, the senator is waiting. Got to go Scott. Call me, huh? Son of a gun. -Zebra-Sam-898... -That's the pick-up we're looking for. Okay, hold it. Now, turn around, slowly. Stop. (MACHINE BEEPING) (MACHINE BEEPING) (MACHINE BEEPING) SCOTT: Thanks, Sergeant. Uh-huh, a bright light. That's a wonderful educated guess, Lieutenant. Now, let me... You have some information about Crossfire? (BREATHING HEAVILY) I'll give you 10 seconds to give it to me. Where is it? -The... -Where? Cupboard. (OBJECTS RATTLING) Ahh! Hey! (GUNSHOTS) -Oh, my god. -(ALARM BLARING) MAN: (ON PA) Alert all section. Repeat, alert all section. Gun fire on the base. Secure all exits. Alert all section. Repeat. Alert all section. Gun fire on the base. Secure all exits. I'm sure he left something for me. See if you can find it. (ALARM CONTINUES BLARING) Alert all section. Repeat. Alert all section. Gun fire on the base. Secure all exits. Alert all section. Repeat. Alert all section. Gun fire on the base. Secure all exits. (GUN COCKING) Halt! Dr. McKenzie, the historian is dead. Good to meet you. Sorry, our introduction must be so brief. (MACHINE BEEPING) (GASPING) You are right. I think this is it. Looks like he made copies. Extract from the United States Cavalry classified memoir, dated July, 1886. "Order to escort President Cleveland to Tucson "to attend the secret meeting with the Mexican Minister of War. "Troops ran into trouble when outlaws attacked the stage near the Pulmari River." Listen to this. "Disaster was avoided "by the timely intervention of a stranger "who used the deadly accuracy, pair of pistols "marked with a silver star." Doesn't it give a specific date in July? Mmm-mmm. "Later, the president commented that the fireworks he saw that day "were better than those one week before in Washington." Wait a second. Washington, fireworks in July. Independence Day. -Got to be... -4th of July. And the attack took place one week later, -four plus seven, July 11th. -July 11th. You think... It's all we've got. We've got to go back to July 11th, 1886. Professor, this isn't your fight. Cole's a killer. You might not ever come back. Lady, I got to be perfectly honest with you. There's not much left here for me anymore and there hasn't been for some time. I feel that my entire life has led up to this moment. I don't know if I'm ever going to feel like this again. You've got to take me back to 1886. You can't deny me this. Come with me. Place your hand on this. Here. What's it going to feel like? It feels for a moment like you're everything in the universe all at once. (MACHINE BEEPING) Welcome to 1886. Wow. Looks the same to me. Oh, yeah? Look over there. SCOTT: My car. You left it in the 20th century. I hope I remembered to turn the lights out. (BIRDS CHIRPING) If you're right about the 11th, they didn't get here yet. The sign said they rode out of the west. They'd hit him right there. It's a perfect place for an ambush. They'd come right out from under the sun. They could be out there right now, hiding. Let's get out of here. (DOG BARKING) (HORSE NEIGHING) Put the damn horse, quiet or ill quiet you for good. Sure they're coming? They're coming. What if there's no go? They got a coach and an escort. What the hell do you think they're protecting, sawdust? Cole would be here too. (MEN YELLING AT A DISTANCE) MAN: Let's go. Yeah! -Here comes the coach. -Stay down. MAN: Come on! Let's go! Yeah-ha! Yeah! Get him. Ho! Ho! Ho! Dismount! (GUN FIRING) Move it. Get him out of here. (GRUNTS) (HORSE NEIGHING) (FIRING CONTINUES) Where is the stranger? He's here. (GUN FIRING) (GUNSHOT) Cole! Of course! He eliminated the man who historically saved the day. And he turns a raid that was once successfully stopped into full scale massacre. No, he hasn't. Professor! Professor! We can't let him win. Professor! Don't do it. He'll kill you. Professor! (HORSE NEIGHING) Get back, Mr. President. -Stay down, Mr. President. -Get down, Mr. President. I'll draw his fire. Attack. MAN: Run fast! Cole! Please stay down, Mr. President. Major, if you please. Climb down, sir. Draw, professor. After you, sir. Congratulations, Professor McKenzie. You made it just in time. Are you all right, Mr. President? Well, I'll live out my term. Who was that man? I'd like to shake his hand. I don't know, sir. -Major, go get him. He deserves a medal. -Yes, sir. -Major. -Yes, sir? You better hold off a minute. (GRUNTS) You're hurt bad, mister? No, I'll be all right. Thanks. You sure? Do I know you? Uh-uh. CRAWFORD: Where did you come from? We were just passing through, thought we could lend a hand. Appreciate it. Hmm. And thank you too, stranger. My pleasure. You take care of yourself. You too. Move out! GEORGIA: A little higher in the upper right corner. Yeah. Little... That's it. Perfect. They are beautiful, aren't they? Yes, they are and you're going to take very good care of them for both us. You're going back east, are you? Yeah, back east. Take me with you. (SIGHS) You're not of my time. It's against the rules. Then stay here. I'm not of your time either. I'm sorry. I can't. You understand? Yes. Yes. Then why the long face, professor? Sometimes... Sometimes in my life it seems like just when I get used to something, it goes away. You're going to be all right. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you too. Do you promise me that if I ever need your help, I can come back and borrow you for a while? Of course. Huh? What is it? I can't break the rules but I sure can bend them. -(MACHINE BEEPING) -Hey, wait a minute. Goodbye, professor. BILLY: Through the window, Dad. SCOTT: Through the window, pal. -Here's your school report, honey. -Thank you. Very good. Why would any kid who knows as much about the Old West as you, choose to write about the zoo? Let's teach him to open car doors first before we move on to the more difficult things. Okay. Give us a kiss and you got a deal. -Okay. See you later, guys. -(SIREN WAILING AT A DISTANCE) Yes! LAURIE: Don't take too much time oiling your guns, partner. Bye, Dad. No! (HORN HONKING) Gas, gas, gas, step on the gas. OFFICER 1: Stay back. Stay back. -Billy, are you all right? -Yes. Yeah? Oh! (SIGHS) Oh, my God. Oh, Scott... It's almost as if you knew.
