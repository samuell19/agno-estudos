Jomar! Jomar. What's your problem? The plug, Jomar! I think I'll go and lie down for a while. Hello? Hello? Is there anyone there? I need a lift pass. Hello. I need a lift pass. See that casserole there. Fill it with snow and you'll get a pass. What do I do next? Put it on the primus stove, then light it. - Have you got matches? - You have to come and get them. - Can't you bring them down here? - No. - Why not? - Because I'm laying down. What's your problem, you can't get up? Why don't you stop nagging and come get them? - One more here needs a pass. - So, give her a pass then. Take one yourself. Take two. Has the snow melted? NORTH - Hello Jomar. - Can I play against the winner? Jomar, let's have our talk. Fine with me. You're looking good. How are you doing? I don't know. Ok, I guess. What are you up to these days? - It's tunnel-disaster-week on NGC. - On what? NGC. National Geographic Channel. I'm watching that. It got to over a 1000 degrees in the Mt. Blanc tunnel in that fire in 1999 When you're in a burning tunnel, you go downwards, and not up, because of the toxic fumes. - You don't like it in the ski park... - It's better being here. I was thinking I could stay a couple of months more. You can't stay here for the rest of your life. - Are you using your skis? - Maybe I could stay on the weekends? - You can visit. That's nice, but... - I want to remain as a patient here. We've been through this, Jomar. I loved Linnea just as much as you did. - She chose me, that's the case. - Well, then she chose me. You became weird and treated her bad. I got sick. People get sick all the time. Now you're here to straighten things out so that you and Linnea can live happily wherever the hell you're living now. - That's what makes it difficult. - Who makes it difficult? Who makes what difficult, Lasse? Shit. - You're getting out of here! - You've got a four-year old son. - You're leaving now! - No. That boy... he probably looks at you as his father. - Of course he does. - Look at you. A freerider on sponsorship. I'm no father. I've got panick attacks. Can't even take the bus. - Impossible project... - You have to go and visit him. - Where are you headed now? - South. Just need to get away? Do I have a choice? You're not struggling with anxiety or anything like that? No, not that I know of. No, just angry? Pissed off in the old fashioned male way. No anxiety. Motherfucker! - Grandma, there's a man outside. - A man? He is snowblind. He's been snowblind before and says he needs to lay down in a dark room for a couple of days. - Here? - Yes But... that's not a good idea. And we don't have any dark room. - But we need to help him. - I don't think that's a good idea. He trusts me. But it's not a good idea, Lotte. You'll only get sad when he leaves. I get so sick of it. It wasn't me who decided to live so far away from everything that no one ever comes around. And when somebody finally comes around, I can't even let them in. I'm letting him in. Don't think I'll feed or nurse him in any way, you'll have to do that. - You are welcome inside. - Yeah, are you sure? Sure. - Hey, could you shut the door? - Are you hungry? No. There's so much light in here. Can you shut the door? - I'll be keeping an eye on you. - Grannie! Don't you try anything. What could I possibly try? I'm blind for Christ sakes. Oh, you know perfectly well what I'm talking about. Are you asleep? - Are you sleeping? - Mmmm. Don't you have any homework to do? - Is "Henriksen" with a K? - What? - Is "Henriksen" spelled with a K? - Yes. - Born? - Born? - Yes. When are you born? - July 7, 1977. - 7777. That's four sevens. - What are you doing? - Favourite colour? - No. We'll do this some other time. - Favourite drink? - Coke. - Favourite band? - I can't think of anyone. - Kaizers Orchestra? - Yeah, write that. They're good. - You're just saying that. - No, they've got loads of good songs. - Are you in love? - No. - How many children do you want? - I have no clue. - Have you got any kids? - I'm really tired... - Haven't you been sleeping all day? - Yes. I think you said Kaizers Orchestra just to let go. - No, I didn't. - So what's their best song? - What? - Which is their best song? - Their best song? - Yes. - That..."Ompa". - Hum the tune. - No. - Yes. I don't give a fuck about Kaizers Orchestra. They're pathetic. - Only Danes like them. - You've got serious problems. I'm in pain. - You're coming out now! - What? You're coming out of there! - What's happening? - Come sit down. So, you think we should move down to the village? No, I don't think anything. - Where are her parents? - Gone. - Gone? - They're gone. I believe you think we should move down to the village. Ok. I'll consider it. - Yes? - I need to go to the bathroom. Okey, thanks. You can go out now. I'm just showing him to the bathroom. There's a lot of fuzz with guests, Lotte. Go away! Hey... thanks for helping me out. - Don't worry about it. - I mean it. And sorry for being an ass earlier. I'm in such pain. It's alright. And I gave you the wrong answer about my favourite drink. You gave the wrong answer? On purpose? - Why would you do that? - Well, I don't know you that well and didn't know how you would react if I told you the truth... - What's it supposed to say instead? - It should say booze. Speaking of booze, I could really use some now. - I know grannie's got some. - She does? Yes? Do you want me to mix it with something? No. No. In that box on the back of the snowmobile you'll find some pills. Could you bring them? And a pack of smokes? But isn't it foolish to mix alcohol and pills? - What happens when you do that? - Nothing. That's the good thing. What do you like doing best? Well. It used to be skiing. Now I can't really tell. - Where are you headed really? - Let's stick to that memory book. No. You're off to school soon? Shouldn't you get some sleep? You got a best friend? No, have you? Can I sleep in there with you? - Sleep here? - Yes. - What will your grandma say? - I don't care about that. - And we're only going to sleep. - I'll sit by you 'til you fall asleep Suddenly I was just laying there. Couldn't do a thing. After skiing almost all my life, suddenly it was out of the question. And Linnea... Just got sick of it in the end. She was patient for a long time but then she... One day she said: Either you get up right now or I'm leaving. And I didn't get up. Just layed there. I regret that. It's my fault. Jomar Henriksen. - I've got a son up north. - Yes. - Bye. - Bye now. Everything around here belongs to me! - What's happened here? - I have no idea. There was lots of smoke. I think the engine's run hot. - A "city boy" on a snowmobile? - Yes. - Do you want me to have a look at it? - Would you? Sure. - Ulrik. - Jomar. - Where are you headed? - North... preferably. - North where? - Tamok Valley. This one's dead. It won't go anywhere. - Are your parents at home? - In Thailand. Mom has COPD and dad's got cancer in his dick. Got any booze? - Are you gay? - Why do you ask? - Lf you're gay you can't come inside. - Why do you think I'm gay? You killed the snowmobile. Sat there waiting for me by the road. You're going to Tamok Valley. And you're prancing around the yard. - Many weird things going on. - I'm not gay. - Sure? - Bloody hell, I'm not gay. - Nothing against gays but I'm not. - Do you have any gay friends? - Yeah. I used to anyway. - Right. I really need some booze now. - Is that all you've got? - Yes. But I've got a method. - How drunk do you want to get? - Blasted. But this... - You'll get blasted. - Ok. - But you're not gay? - No. - What are you doing? - A Polish dude taught me this trick. What is this? Now, you do the same on me. - What do we do now? - We just wait. Have you got any cigarettes? Would you go get them? Can't you? They're in a bag on the snowmobile. I'm not carrying pineapples. Are there pineapples in the bag? - No. - Are you sure? Yeah. I didn't bring any bloody pineapples. Fucking faggot fruit. - You've got a woman in Tamok. - No, I don't. You sure as hell have got a woman in Tamok. No, I don't. You'll get pussy when you get there. I have no idea of how to get there. And it's all pretty uncertain. - Uncertain it'll be the way you say. - What a depressed attitude. Of course you'll get pussy! Won't even have to wait 'til Tamok Valley. I know about this woman in Narvik. - Oh please, nothing vulgar. - Look now, come on... No, I won't. - Fanny, 32, Narvik. - No, no, no, no Look at that pussy! Look now! - Looks ok to me. - Ok? You fucking faggot. Doesn't it make you wanna come all over the place? Well, sort of... Damn, you get more stoned than drunk from this shit. Come on, hit me in the belly! Come on now. Hit me in the belly. Come on! - Hit me in the belly! - I'm not going to do that. And why? Hit harder! Feeling down? Damn it, Jomar. I've only known you for a couple of hours. Can't you feel how well we connect. Really well. Fucking well. - Sure as hell. - God damn it, Jomar. Hello, it's Linnea. Hello? Hello? Look now. You're so bloody serious. I haven't seen you smile since you got here. Is it some sort of a city thing, that you can't be happy? I've shown you a lot of tricks. Now it's your turn, you party pooper. - Want to see a trick? - I sure as hell want to see a trick. - What do I get for that? - A friend for life. The last one who said that ran off with my girlfriend. And my son. Come on. When I say you get a friend for life, that's what you get. I need a pair of skis. - Look now. - Look where? - Upwards. - Upwards? Jomar. Jomar? Damn it, Jomar. - Does she know you're coming? - Don't even know it myself. Alright. - I need some stuff to get going. - Take whatever you need. Things are a bit difficult sometimes. That's what it's always like. Just don't give up. - What the hell are you doing here? - I... I was only... We're excluded from the exercise because of you. - Where are you headed? - North. - And when you're not going north? - Then I will consider heading south. - Thanks for not shooting me. - We should thank you. Hello! Anyone here? Didn't you hear me calling? I heard you. I was thinking... if I didn't reply, you would move on. - But you didn't. - No. - Jomar. - Ailo. - What sort of a guy are you then? - You tell me. - Where are you headed? - Tamok Valley. Tamok? Got some business in Tamok? - Yeah, possibly. - It's right over the mountain. - You got any booze? - So, you're booze hound? Yeah, occasionally. Booze is coming. Hold on. Hi dad. You've got a guest? Jomar. Just passing through. - Good. Who's that fool? - I don't know. - It's getting milder now. - So I've noticed. The ice broke on Beaver Lake water a couple of days ago. Alright. It's that global warming everybody's talking about. Might be so. - You're not coming back home then? - No. You don't look as worn out as you say you are, you'll manage another year? I'm staying here. As you like. Goodbye then. Bye, and thanks for the booze. You're welcome. And don't let him drink it all up for you. I'll watch out. May I ask why you've got a chain around your ancle? Jomar, Jomar... Fishing for answers but you're not getting any. I've got a chain around my ancle and that's how it is. What the hell is that smirk about? It's the ice breaking. Spring is here. - And it's not dangerous? - Dangerous or not... That depends. Aren't that many people living in Tamok Valley. Who are you going to see? Someone called Linnea. - I've delivered firewood to her. - Ok. - How old are you, Jomar? - Thirty. It's more than fifty years between us. You can make up for a lot of mistakes in fifty years. - You can make a lot of new ones also. - You can make up for them too. You're a kid, Jomar. You're just a kid. This is mom's answering machine, leave a message. Hi Linnea, it's Jomar... Jomar. Jomar. I'll give you this. You get this from me. You get points for all you buy. At the end of the year you get a bonus. - It can add up to be a lot of money. - Yes... Thanks. You're welcome. You are welcome, Jomar.
