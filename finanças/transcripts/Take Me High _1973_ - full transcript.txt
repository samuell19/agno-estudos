I went out with the chairman! I couldn't just get up and leave. Why the hell not? You know, when you're angry you look absolutely awful. I'm only going to New York. New York, is that all? It's promotion! Where the hell do you think I fit in New York? When I've settled in... Yes? Well, maybe you could come over. Why don't you wake up to yourself? I give you one week. For what? For some poor girl in New York to find out what it's like to feed a parasite! It only took from breakfast till dinner for you to forget my birthday. How long do you think it would take in New York? You have been so busy bawling me out, but as a matter of fact, I did not forget. Too late. Oh, come on, open it. Too late! Oh, come on, darling, happy birthday for yesterday. Keep your distance!

Stay there Matthews, save yourself the walk. So sorry, there's been a slight change of plan. New York is off. You're posted to Birmingham. Birmingham? Just as bad as I expected. Even worse. But I've got to face it. Face Birmingham, face furness Orlando, and face Hugo flaxman, strutting around out there as the merchant banker of Birmingham. Did he phone you or were you stupid enough to phone him? In that case the man's a fool and he's lost his nerve. Push the quote up half a million. With cancer moving right now into the 10th house. Yes, all in all, a very good move. We'll make that half million. All I want is five thousand. Darling, the plain fact is that your signs are just not propitious at the moment. Saturnine turbulence is... Please, Hugo, this is a business matter! Of course. The file on the French restaurant, please, sue. Flaxman, no. Hugo. Hello, flaxman. Well, if it isn't Hugo flaxman. No, no, I'll pretend I've forgotten his name. How do you do, um, oh, I'm afraid that I've... We've met somewhere before. The face, I recognise the face, but... But what if he pretends not to know me? What I'm particularly concerned about is the relationship between you and your partner. How do things stand? Paul? Alright, I suppose. Occasional disagreements, but nothing to disturb the business. My information is that it's all washed up. Have you been snooping around the staff? You see, willful obstinacy and aggression are dominant as your partner's aries sign approaches the cusp of the first house. For heaven's sake, take me seriously! I'm in trouble! I take you deadly seriously. Besides, I may be in trouble too. A rival approaches to threaten my position. But how does he stand with the chairman? Mind you, I was the one who was offered the New York job, not flaxman. Even if they didn't actually send me. The fact that I've arranged for furness Orlando to finance your business may be hard to justify in business terms, but as a gesture of pure friendship. Are you making a pass at me? We're beginning to talk the same language. But I need a loan. Natural selection, that's the chairman's game. The weakest goes to the wall. Right. Right. If I'm right, and I think I am, yes, two weeks hence, Venus will rule alone in a position of glory. That will be the moment. For a loan or for love? Second and fifth house, my dear. Both. So, it's a fight, is it? Okay, then may the best man win, as long as it's me. There's a new man joining us from the London office. I shall have to put it to him as a matter of courtesy. They've appointed a London man over you? Either of us could get the top job. So, you have a rival. Just a competitor, not a serious threat. Show Mr. Matthews straight into my office when he arrives, please, val. Mr. Matthews has just gone into the board room. Matthews! Flaxman. Can I get you a drink? Good to see that you've made yourself at home. Oh, might as well get to know my way around a bit. What'll you have? Do you mind if I help myself? Go ahead. Well, there's no point in beating about the bush. Not sure I follow you, dear boy. Well, the chairman tells me you've had it pretty cushy here for a couple of years. He sent me to pep up the pace a bit. Your pace or mine? He's looking to competition for dramatic results. At the end of the year it's either you or me for branch director. With a seat on the board. So, we know the stakes. Here's to the action. Well, the action's away from home tonight, dear boy. And you're invited. But there's been a change of government, of course there's been a change of policy! Cunningham and his henchmen are out at last, and now the people have the power. The city's been waiting for these amenities a long time, Mr. Jackson, so your outright rejection of the Cunningham scheme came as a surprise. Now, sir, Harry Cunningham was the only serious contender, surely he has all the qualifications? He has all the qualifications for turning a public amenity into a source of private profit, and the people of Birmingham have waited long enough not to have to line sir Harry Cunningham's pockets for privileges which are theirs by right. Let me finish, as I'm now the democratically elected keeper of the public purse, great! There's one thing I'm sure of that Cunningham's had the last contract kick-back he's going to get from this city. You don't talk about me like that and get away with it, Jackson! Is there any actual basis for that accusation? Every agreement I've reached on behalf of my union with the Cunningham management over the last 30 years he's handed straight to his lawyers to search for loopholes and exploitation. You despicable little demagogue. You're not abusing your public position of responsibility to take revenge are you? How d'you think Cunningham's managed to swallow up business after business only to close them down put hundreds of people out of work and build empty office blocks on the site. If not with the help of his mates when they were on the council? No brothers, the payola's run out. Very good, oh I hope the fascist old so-and-so is watching. So you are seeking revenge? Yes, keep him taking, friend, we'll be right there, there, now then they're all ready and loaded. With public money? With money raised by the council on favourable terms. Not again Harry. Not on terms that'll pour unearned profit into the coffers of the Cunningham empire. Couldn't he have just turned it off? Interviewer should be shot, a Cunningham stooge. Because he asked the awkward question? Well it was easy enough for you to reject Cunningham on television but where else are you going to find 10 million? Mr. Matthews, in Birmingham, Tim. In Birmingham you're either with Cunningham or against him, which side are you on? I'm an outsider, I've only been here a few days, I don't know, Mr. Jackson. Bert, but you might have access to the cash. Come on, Bert, he'll be mad if you keep him waiting. You go on ahead, I'll catch you up. He'll be gunning for you. Cunningham? Uh-huh, in a corner for the first time in his life and I put him there, wants a personal explanation of why he's been rejected. Well if you're still alive, let's have lunch. Okay. D'you know a place called le restaurant francaise? Diamond street, the French restaurant? That's it. See you dinner time then. Right, now I must find some place to live. Oh, if you need any advice I can give you the name of a good estate agent. I give advice, I don't take it. Gas street? # I won't let no troubled waters # # rock the boat I'm rowing # # concrete city you can't slam the door in my face # # I may be a stranger but I # # sure know where I'm going # # concrete city you better set another place # # you'll never get a foot on the moon # # if you always keep your feet on the ground # # and if that's the way you wanna be found # # well just sleep on # # while I keep on winning # # any day now I'll be winning # # another day and I'll be grinning # # beginning to begin again # # winning # # do yer do yer do yer do yer # # do do yer do yer do yer do yer # # do do yer do yer # # I believe that you're a tough town # # and that's the way I like 'em # # concrete city I'm not that easily thrown # # here today and gone tomorrow # # if that's the way you see me # # concrete city you find I'm not a rolling stone # # you'll never catch a glimpse of the sun # # if your head is always under a cloud # # and while you're only thinking out loud # # I'll be sweetly # # completely winning # # and day now I'll be winning # # another day and I'll be grinning # # beginning to begin again yeah # # winning # # do do yer do yer do yer do yer # # do do yer do yer do yer do yer # # do do yerdo yerdo # # winning # # any day now I'll be winning # # another day and I'll be grinning # # beginning to begin again # # winning # # do do yer do yer do yer do yer # # do do yer do yer do yer do yer # # do do yerdo yerdo # Turning her into a holiday boat are you? I'm going to live in her. Right here, slap in the middle of the city we'll be neighbours then. Neighbours. What's this then Paul? Veal. Oh. You could've fooled me. You can fool anyone in this godforsaken fish and chip town. But we're not trying to fool them. It's a business, not a good food crusade. Just like every other cafe in brum, fobbing people off with third rate frozen food. We should complain, if we make a profit that way. We don't and I don't want to make a profit that way. Listen, darling, we're here to make bread to get us out of this place, right, I mean that's what we want isn't it? I don't know what you want anymore, I thought we decided... I just don't want to be stuck here. It's my home town, Paul and good things do come out of it from time to time. The way I see it there's only one good thing coming out of Birmingham and that's the motorway south. A boat? Longboat. Narrow boat? Whatever. And you're going to live in it? How else could I buy living space in the centre of the city for just a few hundred pounds? People used to work those boats damned hard for a living, and now you want to turn one of 'em into a fancy pad, you reckon it's good for your image. I'm going to work here. Most of the money people I know live in big houses forty or fifty miles out just drop in for a few hours a week to take the pickings. I reckon I'd do better with my finger on the pulse, noising among the grass roots. On the canal. I'm sorry about this, Bert. Ooh all right by me, brother, I'll eat anything if people are silly enough to pay the prices. Was everything all right for you? All right for me love, but my friend here's paying and he's a bit of a gourmet, very unhappy. I'd like to hear any complaints. Oh it wasn't as bad as all that. Oh come off it, you've been bitching to me about it all the time, why don't you tell the management. The management's better looking than you. But we'd like to know. So what was wrong with the soup? Dehydrated. You chose one of the less popular things on the menu. It's a long menu for such a small place. You're right and we can't cook everything. So why put it on-? Put it on the menu? I'll take the matter up, anything else? Well the trout was a bit tired of waiting, I'd have guessed it was ready at about, ooh, ten thirty? Go on. I'm sorry but you did ask. And the caramel was burnt. Hm, you said it. I'll pass your complaints onto the chef, if you win us a shorter menu, you'll have done the house a good turn. Oh well I'm glad about that because the house red was really more house than red. I really am sorry about all this. And look, you won't be charged. Would you like to try our coffee? Bert? Yes please, coffee. Only because I'd like to know what the hell you can find to complain about in a cup of coffee. What was all that about? All what? Chatting up the customers. Listen Paul, either we have a shorter menu or you let me do some of the cooking. So what's supposed to be wrong? Just tell me why we have to scrape the bottom of the barrel? Ah professional complainers make me sick. But he's right, right about every course, and right about the menu being too long. I'll take two of those. Don't get so upset. Ah those'll smooth it over. It'll take more than Irish coffee. If it's any comfort, it's Irish. Oh there's nothing I like more'n a little Irish comfort. Oh, good. It wasn't good I know, but I hope you'll give us a second chance. I'll be back love. I hope so. I can't make out whether it's you or me she fancies. I think you'll find it's me. Trouble dear boy, I'm afraid you'll have to handle this one. Well who is it? Cancer with scorpio, worst possible conjunction, I'm too involved. You! So it was you, spying. Just what do you think you know about running a restaurant? Well, I like food. But you're refusing to lend us the money. I've appraised your business as a financial risk. You caught us on the hop, we were short staffed. You're trying to do too much with too few people and with far too little capital. Then lend us some more. We'll be on our feet within six months. You'll be on your back in three. Not a chance. You're closing us up? I'm cutting your losses. It's for your own good. I know what's good for me. I've worked for two years for this, there were half a dozen people, we've all worked hard together and taken nothing out of it. It takes more than good intentions. Oh, stuff the clich?s. Look at this is business you only asked us for the money and I only said no. Where's flaxman, why did he think we were worth the money? We see things more clearly now. He's passed the buck, you're just the hatchet man aren't you? Flaxman's very sorry but he does agree. Do you know I think you're right? Cancer descending. Hugo! So, the sneak at the keyhole. You're just the sort of creep I always thought you were. Sarah! You knew I'd tell you exactly what I thought of you as soon as you stopped the money, so you hide behind closed doors and pass the dirty work on to someone else. That's right. You're just as bad! And you, I know what you wanted flaxman. Sarah, please what do you think I am. Listen to the lady and find out. You're a... Alright, alright, okay, I know, I know you think I'm a, but look at it my way, I mean you come marching in here asking for help and what can I do? I mean look at me, I'm a normal, healthy, hungry male. Ah! Well what d 'you expect of a man? You've no right to come in here. Oh you'll have to get on your knees if you want to see eye to eye. Now who asked you to interfere? You did, believe me, he did. Well keep out of it now. There's a lady in distress. Yes, you keep out of it, I don't want your help. Right, because you don't need anybody's help. You set out to ruin my business judgement and you did. You're totally unscrupulous, you're a menace and you shouldn't be allowed in business. Oh boy do I feel sorry for you. Shut up both of you. Can't a woman even have a fight in a bank? # there's too much love # # there's too much peace # # there's too much joy # # in the world today # # there's too much love # # there's too much peace # # there's too much joy # # in the world today # # there's too much love # # see the milk of human kindness cut off # # don't you understand # # there's too much love # # # that's the way it is here # # in the anti-brotherhood of man # # there's too much love # # don't believe or be misled # # don't let them catch you if you can # # sing a song of indecision # # sing a song of apathy # # we don't wanna hear no other melody # # sing a song that's pessimistic # # sing a song that gives no hope # # we don't wanna pay new money # # for old rope # Could've left me out of that, dear boy. What, after you dropped me right in it? I didn't want to get held up. Oh you didn't. We've got bigger fish to fry. Intruders, ten degrees left 120 yards. Friendlies, hulbert, stop. Stop! Lunatic! Friendlies I said, you damn fool, friendlies. But begging your pardon, you, you signalled intruders. One for friend, three for foe. You've got these damned muffs on, how do you expect to hear what I say? And don't you dare flinch from the fire. Watch out! Sorry lads, but these verminous rodents I'm after, climb aboard, weapons, hulbert. Yeah grey squirrels nothing but tree rats eating the saplings and pigeons and rabbits in the crops, they'll have the place a desert in no time. Ah to hell with the signals, hulbert, drive! Stand by to pick off the flankers, if anything escapes to either side you're answerable by me now then flaxman, what's your scheme for my money? Shoot! Steady hulbert. Don't play the fool man, just tell me. Well I imagine you'd want some set aside to get rid of Jackson. Ah I can take care of Jackson, you come to the point. A takeover, baynes electric, with a bit of internal book cooking I think the shareholders could be persuaded that it's a good thing. Ten million should take care of the deal, with a good under the table wad for old man baynes himself. Good lad, give the boy a chance man, ah! - Sir? - Eh? Well what do you think? Ah! Ah, missed him. Huh, what's the alternative lad? Good! The council's looking for money to back its city cross development, now from every point of view that represents the best investment you could possibly make. I know it's a labour council and it's Bert Jackson, but from a purely financial point of view... Argh, stop! Damned red revolutionaries! Get off! Get out! Argh! Vermin! Did you see any rats? I didn't see any rats. # here we go # # another kick in the backside # # you think the feeling ain't worldwide # # until they give it to you # # here we go # # I must have read all the signs wrong # # I should be singing a sweet song # # instead of feeling so sour # # if the shake you by the hand # # and wish you all the best in life # # I can bet you when you turn # # they'll get you with a velvet knife # # why, tell me why # # should you burn the midnight candle # # why waste your breath # # you're gonna need it when you're old # # they'll only find your ideals too hot to handle # # me oh my oh why # # here we go, a lot of negative answers # # just when you thinkin' you chance is # # about the best you'll ever get # jl don't know # # it must be due to the way Mars # # is ill-affecting my good stars # # and disconnecting me again # # if the heavens are against you # # then you're bound to only break your necks # # it can't be good now can it # # in a planetary apoplexy # # why tell me why # # should you burn the midnight candle # # why waste your breath # # you're gonna need it when you're old # # they'll only find your ideals too hot to handle # # me oh my oh why # so... well I- please. Oh, dear boy, I insist. If you've got anything to say after that I shall be most interested to hear it. What do you mean? I mean you just made a prize twit of yourself. Hah! You knew what the old idiot was like. Why he didn't exactly go overboard about your scheme. Of course not. Not until he's had a chance to convince himself that it was all his idea in the first place. Cunningham is not the kind of man you can flatter, Hugo. I know him. He knows you. He's got your measure. He was bored, I tell you. It all went in, never fret. Well at least I made an impression. Yeah, like we were bombed off the estate. But he'll remember it. I imagine the chairman will be a little upset when he hears about your, ah, performance dear boy. I haven't finished yet, that was just the opening shot. I thought you said you sold the Sophie? Yes, well I have. But she looks wonderful. Oh yes, well you do anyway, come on, give us a kiss. Don't she look wonderful, Molly? Hello lovely, it is good to see you, and doesn't she look bright. Must be the Sophie, I've no reason to be bright except you're both looking well. Ah, look, there's the Sunday and I've got something for dinner. Oh, it's not that French pate, is it? No, no, you'll spoil your breakfast, here you are love. Now then Sarah, why aren't you feeling so bright, lovely? Go to start looking for another job. What's happened to the cafe then? Broke. I thought it was doing so well? Trouble was Paul couldn't let it just be a good French caf?, he tried to turn it into a posh restaurant, we got behind with the bills and the bank wouldn't lend us any more money. So where's Paul? We're bust too. Hah, well I've seen that coming. I'm not sorry about that, but I am sorry about the cafe. Anyway I didn't come here to talk about my troubles. Tell me about the Sophie, I see they've repainted your name on the side. Make it look a bit traditional. He's made a right pickle of it, he has. It's not a working boat anymore, Sarah. Ah come on, just 'cos it's a bit different. Looks like he's made a really good job of it to me. Ah, you can do anything with money. Well who's bought it then? Southerner, works in a bank. Come in. Oh no. Sarah! It had to be you. Well what are you... I did just think it might be you. But what are you doing here? I was born here. Sam and Molly? My mum and dad. They told me what a right mess you'd made of it. D'you want to see it? Things have changed. There were five of us and the cabin stopped here. I know, I've seen the mavis. Of course. I don't know how you survived. We didn't know any different. # from the day a man is born # # till the day he dies # # he holds all life's mysteries # # deep within his eyes # # deep within his eyes # # all the tears and all the joys # # all the truth and lies # # mirrored in the innocence # # of a young girl's eyes # # of a young girl's eyes # Marvellous, but I bet she doesn't go.

We could call it, a brumburger! Oh! Yes? Your nine-thirty call, sir Harry. Oh, quiet! Yes? Er, everything under control sir. Better be, the baynes electric board should be voting now whether to accept our bid. Should be? Don't you know? Oh yes, yes, of course, sir, they are voting now, where exactly are you? Er don't worry, just a slight hold up, nothing can go wrong, I hope not, for your sake, grandpa, our shares jumped eight pence yesterday. Somebody must have leaked the news of the baynes take over. Flaxman blast him, trying to make a personal killing on the deals he does for me, if all goes well I'll have made a bit of a killing too. Hmm. In your name of course, grandpa. Good boy, good boy. Much traffic? Oh nothing to speak of for the time of day. I gather Mr. flaxman is indisposed, he's running a bit of a temperature. Ah. Er gentlemen, I'm happy to say that our bankers haven't let us down. Mr. Matthews has come speeding to our assistance. Mr. Matthews. Mr. chairman, gentlemen, frankly I'm surprised that some of you recommend accepting this offer from the Cunningham group. Now I shall of course demonstrate with figures, but I must say at the outset that every consideration leads me to recommend rejection of this offer. It's off, Bert. What's off? The take-over, baynes board turned it down. Okay, who fixed it? I did. That means there's ten million quid still available. You mean we should use Cunningham's money for the city cross? It's only money. It may be only money to you, mate, it's blood and sweat to me. How're your chances for re-election if the scheme flops? I've fought Cunningham for thirty years in this town, that's why the people of brum put me where I am now. What d'you think they'd say if they saw us doing a deal. When it comes to a hand out it's surprising how much people can take. You don't get any sort of a hand out from Cunningham. Tell them that the money he's been making out of the working people is now being ploughed back, for their benefit. Pull the other one it could be true. Thanks for the game. Wait! You'll come to a meeting? Who with? Cunningham, goodnight Bert. - Goodnight love. - Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

To hell with the ethics. Just how do you think I'm going to explain it to Cunningham oh don't worry, dear boy, I will. - Now... - Why not? He's hunting - hah, so am I. # driving, we go driving # # ooh baby ooh ooh baby ooh ooh # # driving, we go driving # # ooh baby, ooh just me and you. # # ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, # # ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, # # ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, # # oo-o0h, ooh. # Coming up here. Can you see Cunningham? Ah there he is, no sign of the fox of course. Let's move. Whoa! You've got a nerve! Thought I might find you here, I don't accept apologies from bolshies. I'm here to offer you a last chance. Of what? The best deal of your life. Get out! Get out! Ah, ah, get down. Down, down. What have you got in there, the damn fox. Well what have you got to offer? A prestige headquarters for the Cunningham group leased on favourable terms from the council, and it bit of a reputation for yourself as a city benefactor. But most important, the best long term investment you could ever hope to make. That is the way to catch sir Harry Cunningham. I'm glad you've caught him because I've caught the fox. # driving, we go driving # # ooh baby, ooh just me and you ooh. # saved from the jaws of... Matthews! Matthews! What the hell are you up to boy? Matthews! Ah Matthews. What the hell are you doing in there? Just running over the form. It's quite a scheme lad, most ingenious, you've had time to read it then? Time. Nothing else to do after they lost that damned fox. I suppose not. What's funny about that? 25 horse power they say this damn thing is, and it won't get me over the fences. But for my gout I'd be astride a four legged beast and I'd have made a kill by now. There's a good chance of a - a financial killing in the city cross scheme. M-maybe yeah. You've done well, boy. You're interested then? Yes. One can't afford to put prejudices in the path of progress. Or a good healthy profit. Of course. Not that I need the money mind. But that's not going to stop you going for it though. Perhaps not. Tell me, as a matter of interest, how do you get on with this fellow, Jackson. Fine, just fine. Ah, not giving much away eh, haha. You should be working for me. Now when do I have to face this socialist scoundrel? Tomorrow midday, at furness Orlando. And er we'll lay on lunch, just to make things nice and friendly. Right, done. Back, hulbert, back! Back! Business done for the day? Yes, so let's get out of the office. # once there was a way, # # once there was atime # # when everything was # # in it's place and simplified # # when no one bothered counting # # all the tears one cried in vain # # for in the morning more than likely # # one would shine again # # take me high love # # take me high # # take me back to where I've been. # # take me high love # # let me fly love # # in the skyways I once knew # # take me back to the days # # when I was truly never alone # # take me high love, # # take me home, # # once there was a hill, # # once there was a tree, # # once there was a bird who spread its wings and flew # # to places we imagined, # # so much brighter than our own # # yet when the summer sun returned j # our feathered friends came home jq # take me high love, # # take me high # # take me back to where I've been # # take me high love # # let me fly love # # in the skyways I once knew # # take me back to the days # # when I was truly never alone # # take me high love, # # take me home, # # take me high love, # # take me high # # take me back to where I've been # # take me high love # # let me fly love # # in the skyways I once knew # # take me back to the days # # when I was truly never alone # # take me high love, # # take me home, # # take me high love, # # take me home, # # take me high love, # # take me home # Your girlfriend's here. Girlfriend? She's in the boardroom getting lunch. Mmmm. Get your thieving hands off my salad. Sarah, what are you doing here? Working off the overdraft, remember we had to close down. But who's all this for? Tim to impress the clients. Tim eh. You've done well, boy. What clients? Bert Jackson and sir Harry Cunningham. Together? That's it then. Hah, I'd rather have taken you dead than alive. As a capitalist you're living on borrowed time, I've got you more dead than alive. Well this looks suddenly all very Matey. Oh we have a deal Hugo. The city cross development is under way. There's more than one way of making money out of the working class. Congratulations dear boy, a diplomatic coup. But what have you done to pacify Sarah? We're in business together. No sir Harry, you're sitting over here on the right, mm, oh! And you're on the left, Bert. Right, left and centre, very good haha. Come along Hugo you're sitting next to sir Harry. And this for a client who'll be joining us in just one moment. Well to the new deal then. To the new deal. To the new deal. Spare us the loving cup please. What on earth's that? - Brumburgers! - Brumburgers! Brumburgers? Brumburgers? Oh! Created by Sarah Jones my partner in business Sarah, Jackson you know, and this is sir Harry Cunningham. How do you do. Now that's not a bad idea. We are registered as a business. Well now that you two gentlemen are eating at the same table, there is a price to pay. From you Bert, we'd like planning permission to build and from you, sir Harry, we'd like financial backing and factory facilities. Not another restaurant. No, not another restaurant a brumburger! There. Then we get the best of both worlds the waterway and the city. Oh well I know it's a bit of a wreck at the moment but the potential. I know potential when I see it lad. We'll have to get a really good designer of course. Designer? The greatness of Birmingham was built on the brilliance of the cunninghams and you won't find them wanting when it comes to the brumburger. You have the ideas, you will design it and my factories will make it. And what's more, I never do anything in this city without making a loud noise about it. # well if your back is strong and sturdy # # you can lend a helping hand # # and if you want to play our brand of music # # brother won't you join the band # # every man and every woman # # everybody in the land # # if you're looking for sweet satisfaction # # come along and join the band # # if you think there is room for improvement # # you've got to get into the movement # # la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # # la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # # you may not believe in magic # # but you've got to understand, # # you can help us make some magic happen # # if you come and join the band # # if you think it's time for action # # then it's time you made a stand # # we can make it all work out together # # so brother come and join the band # # if you think there's room for improvement # # you've got to get into the movement # # la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # # la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # # if you think there's room for improvement # # you've got to get into the movement # # la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # # la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la # Fantastic, absolutely fantastic. You know, I don't know how he does it. Cunningham? He's incredible. He's rich. We're all going to be rich. You won't let him take over, Tim? Well how d'you mean? I mean his money. You won't let it become big business. Can't be helped, it's what the people want. That's also what's dangerous. You mean Cunningham's gonna expoit brumburger for quick profit. Never, he doesn't need that kind of bread. Perhaps not sir Harry but someone. Well who? It's our idea, and it's our business. And it's a good idea, so let's make sure we keep it that way because it's ours. You are scared of the big time kid. Just very happy with this time. Ahoy! Anyone aboard? Ah, dear boy, glad to find you at home so to speak. Come on in. Sarah, hello, I say I do hope I'm not interrupting a board meeting or anything. Hello Hugo. Very impressive dear boy. It's taken a long time to earn the pleasure of a visit. I'm tremendously impressed by this brumburger business to tell you the truth. What else but. I've been doing a spot of research, on your behalf. Oh? May 1? Please do well as you two are obviously up to your necks setting up the prototype, I thought I'd have a look at the wider implications, the broader possibilities. Oh yes and what might they be? When you reduce this original brumburger idea of yours with the help of a little cost effective thinking, what you get is a project of quite breath taking profit potential. I mean when you cut out all the eye catching publicity gimmicks of the original idea and get down to the basic bone, what you're left with is a very inexpensive high street food unit marketing point, with unlimited turnover capacity, minimum personnel requirement and maximum profit potential. With pre-mixed, pre-moulded, pre-packed burger meal units bought in bulk from the world bank of simulated soya bean beef. You ship in refrigerated container loads, and distribute to multiple one man marketing points, equipped only with a microwave, cooker and a deep freezer, which you let loose like a chain reaction. Not only in Birmingham, but through the Midlands, the uk and the whole world. We could make Cunningham's fortune look like the contents of a juvenile delinquent's piggy bank. - Stop Hugo, stop! - We could. Well what's the matter, not interested? Appalled that's all. You couldn't be more wrong, Hugo, the brumburger is just not like that. But it's got to be dear boy if you're interested in making a real substantial profit. You are diseased with the pursuit of profit, since when did you get the cure? The whole idea of the brumburger is that it's made from fresh ingredients, locally produced and prepared and cooked immediately, so people know what they're eating and like it. But the manhours, the overheads, I mean you've got to go for productivity. To hell with the productivity, eating and working in the brumburger, is going to be nothing if it's not a pleasure. Oh come on Tim, you know the only pleasure in business is in the profit, I mean if you're in it for anything else, then you're fooling yourselves. You didn't get a great deal of fun out of the French restaurant when it folded, did you? That was different. Was it? Yes, it was. And anyway if you can't fool yourself now and again then you're never going to have any fun even if you do make a profit. You're both mad, you're not in business together, you're in love. # suddenly it seems all the words I know, # # won't paint the picture # # how can I explain all the things I feel # # in just one line # # however I know that # # there must be a word # # that will fit this scene like a glove # # the more I think about it # # the more I know, # # the word is love, # # and if I decline to become involved, # # in conversation # # it's not that I don't care # # how the other half # # is making out # # well maybe tomorrow # # I'll try and encourage # # the eagle to fly with the dove # # but here and now I offer my one excuse # # and the word is love # # well maybe tomorrow # # I'll try and encourage # # the eagle to fly with the dove # # but here and now I offer my one excuse # # and the word is love # What does a man have to do to get a coffee in a place like this? Bert? Hello Bert, been working late? Saw the light, thought I'd drop and say thanks. Well thank you, big day tomorrow then? For all of us well you've made quite a splash in Birmingham, Tim city cross, brumburger, Cunningham's eating out of your hand here, but you don't start eating until tomorrow night. How do you like it? Great. What's the food like? Wait and see. Mm I've been working late love, sorry you don't mind do you. Have a tomato, I wouldn't say no to a carrot love you can't beat a raw carrot. Haven't you eaten tonight, Bert? I didn't come here for the eats. I suppose your boss is pretty pleased with you, Tim. Must be the best deal they've ever done in brum. Come on Bert, what are you after? No, I mean city cross, it's big prestige for furness Orlando. What I want to know is, what you're after now. Haven't even thought about it yet. Where d'you go from here? Oh and who says I'm moving. Oh come on, Tim, you jump to the top of the provincial ladder in one now you can only take off. Tim. I don't want to leave, at all. That's all I wanted to hear. Thanks for the coffee love. See you tomorrow at the council house. Don't forget your carrot. Thanks love. He's really concerned about you, Tim. I think you'll find he's concerned about us. Leaving early? It's all right for you, you're already dressed. I'll see you at the brumburger then. Don't be late. Congratulations dear boy, you've made it to New York after all, New York? Just been talking to the chairman. Well after the city cross deal there's nothing much to keep you in Birmingham. But you'll be staying here. Anything else is bound to be a bit of an anti-climax and you did want to go to New York in the first place. And you get the job of branch director: With a, with a seat on the board what's in the stars then? Sorry dear boy, flat batteries. Hm, so you're on your own. Could I speak to sir Charles furness please. Certainly Matthews. Ah sir Charles. Nice idea of flaxman's, Matthews, I appreciate it. I thought it appropriate that sir Charles should represent furness Orlando at the official announcement of the city cross deal. I know it's always been your baby Matthews, but the publicity is good for the bank. The chairman is a figure the public, know and respect, well let's hope that the public don't mind waiting for him. I'm sure the city council will spare a minute or two for sir Charles furness. What on earth are we waiting for then? Sir Charles furness. Oh to hell with him, he's probably detained young Matthews, so that he can scoop all the glory for himself. Hah yes come on Jackson, let's tell the people what they want to know. Don't think that my being here in any way detracts from our appreciation of your achievement I have told the chairman of the admirable flair with which, you've handled the whole deal. We post you to the provinces and in no time at all, you've pulled off a deal that would do credit to the city itself. I'm impressed. But flaxman suggests that you're not fully extended in Birmingham. Well I mentioned how disappointed you were that you didn't get the New York job. But you've earned your move, my boy, that's why I'm transferring you to the New York branch. But I don't want to leave. Well I think we should leave now for the council house. We don't leave here until it's clearly understood, that I want to stay in Birmingham. It's promotion. I don't care what it is, I don't want to go. Why not send flaxman? City cross was your initiative, your achievement, I'm rewarding you. After this anything else here's bound to be a bit of a bore old boy. That is for me to decide. Well you'll hardly pull of a bigger deal. That may not be the whole point. It is if you're working for furness Orlando. But you're not, altogether are you? Perhaps we should mention your other interests to sir Charles. What I do outside the walls of this office, don't be bashful dear boy. He's opening a brumburger. A what? A brumburger, a cheap hamburger joint, a kind of restaurant. A restaurant, another restaurant, Matthews I absolutely forbid it. The brumburger is opening tonight, after the announcement of the city cross. Whatever this place is Matthews, I order you to terminate all furness Orlando interest in it at once, and to accept the New York post. Furness Orlando has no interest in the brumburger whatsoever, and if you insist on my going to New York then I shall resign and [I'll take the Cunningham account with me. Cunningham? Sir Harry Cunningham's money is behind this brumburger. You're threatening me, Matthews. Sir, a compromise. Let Matthews stay in Birmingham. And you'll go to New York. Right, I'm off to the council house. Here Matthews. I suggest we leave Matthews in pursuit of his appropriately provincial status, how about another drink? I've a powerful sense of being manipulated here. I'll be happy to go to New York sir Charles. I'm sure you would, I'll just be happy to see you go. Silence if you want to hear us speak. Quiet! Now. To the brumburger! Quick, get over there I'm in a hurry. To the brumburger! Get out of it! # brumburger # # brumburger # # now if you're getting tired # # of the places you've been to. # # here is your chance # # to open your eyes to something new. # # we guarantee that you will be # # in the best of hands # # so, come on get on your feet # # and give your belly a treat tonight. # you built the bloody roads, you'd think you'd know your way around them.
