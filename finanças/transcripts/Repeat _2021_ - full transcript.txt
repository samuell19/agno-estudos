So this is it. How's it going? Not bad at all. Okay. All right. Okay. So the brain is the most complicated thing in the universe. Did you know that? Well, yeah. You said it in our first class. You know, there's a myth that we only ever use 10% of our brain at any one time, but we actually use almost all of it all the time, even when we're asleep. Well, what does it do? Well, that is what we're trying to find out. It's ready. Oh, great. Okay. Cool, let's go. What is that? Oh, quite sorry. Actually, we are going to send a message to your brain, now which to you should feel like a question. And we just want you to think of the answer and then it should... It should appear on one of these screens. Like telepathy? Yeah. Yeah, actually, like telepathy. You know, it would actually work better, I think, if you were asleep, 'cause of the outside interference, but we're gonna work on it and see if it works while you are fully awake. Is that safe? And shouldn't you be doing this at uni? It's all above board. You know, we're just working on it here before we take it in house. Okay. We have only program two, yeah? 2.2. Is it showing up clear? - Mm. - Great. Okay, cool. Let's go. If you could just stand yourself there. So, you are gonna place a hand either side of the ring... And you might feel a little tingle. Tingle? Yeah. There's nothing to worry about. Okay. Ah! God. - No, you okay? - Yeah, it wasn't a tingle. - It was like a shock. - Let me see. Hang on, what did you run? - Are you sure you're okay? - No, I'm fine. Okay, so sorry. Sorry, I wasn't expecting that. This could take ages to reboot now, so... Sorry. Thank you. I'll see you in class next week. What was that? - Ryan. - No, listen. I think we'd better pack up, okay? - I'll see you at work. - Wait. - Look at this. - What? It's just read-ins from the probe. Want me to boost it? Yeah. Yeah, keep going to 120. Can you pass me those? Hello? What are you? Listen, we are recording this, right? Yeah. Sort of still running. Okay, thank you, everybody, for coming. My name is Ryan Moore, and I'm a professor of cognitive science at the University of Burton. And... Well, it doesn't really seem like anyone else is gonna be coming, So... Should we just kick on? Yeah. Oh, okay. Let's go. Okay, get ready. It's gonna get a bit noisy. Okay. Do we have a volunteer? Anybody? It's perfectly safe. Yeah. You? Okay. And your name? Tom. Tom, great. Now, let's... yeah. You got someone you'd like to speak with? My dad. Did he pass recently? Couple of months ago. Look, I can't actually guarantee if we're gonna speak with anyone at all, but... I'll try my best. I know what you're thinking. Cognitive science? Isn't that sort of just brain stuff? But yes. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it's how I actually initially made this discovery. You know, today we're gonna be communicating with a signal. Operates almost like a brainwave on the theta spectrum. But in order to do that, we need some DNA, which will sort of filter down the signal allowing us to speak with a single sort of, well, voice. And we can only really keep the machine up for about three minutes... But today we will prove that... when you die isn't the end. Or rather the end is... just the beginning. Today Tom... I mean, Tom, you can ask whatever you want. Okay. These swabs are completely sterilized, so the only DNA on these will be that of Tom's. So if you could just rub that on the inside of your cheek, that'd be great. Okay. Okay. What would you like to say? Can I ask where they are? Who are you? Well, I'll tell it your name. So we go, "Tom." Tom, where's Muffin? She's... She's at home. How did you do that? I mean, I didn't. So, who's Muffin? Our dog. Seriously, how did you know that? Well, I don't. I mean, whoever this is does. All right, then. What color were my walls as a kid? Okay, you wanna ask it what color your walls were? Okay. Okay. Train. Okay, I mean sometimes the responses are not the best, so a minute and a half. I had train wallpaper. This is crazy, man. There's no way you could have known that. Yeah, I know, so... Ask if there's a God and a Heaven. Okay, I mean, are you religious? No, neither was he. No. When you are dead, you are dead. Well, ask him where he is, then. Dark. All dark. Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? Where am I? - Where am I? - Oh, no. - It's okay. - Where am I? Sometimes this happens. It's just a repeat from the links. Tom? Okay. I'm sorry. So, okay, so it's okay. Okay, thank you, Tom. You can take a seat. Does... Does anybody have any questions? - Ryan? - Oh, yeah. Just a sec. You have a guest. Hi. I was at your show last night, and I don't know what came over me, but I followed you here after, and I know how that must sound. I mean, you could have spoken to me after the show. I was actually asking for questions. Yeah, I was nervous, and I'm sorry... I am sorry that I'm here now. It's just I lost my husband about four years ago... Okay, well, I've got another demo coming up. Maybe you could come to that. You know, 20 years we'd been together, and I... Listen. It would just mean so much to me to know that he's okay. It's not just that, you know. We need some DNA and other bits and pieces, so... Oh, yes, of course. Sure. I've got this. It's a lock of his hair. I guess that'll be okay. I'm happy to pay if you... We're not gonna take your money. Okay, I can't make any promises, but... So if you'd just tell me what you wanna say, okay? And we'll take it from there, but I'll start. All right. What was his name? John. John, okay. I'm here. Is it him? Don't tell me his last name, okay? I'll ask. John Keaton. Oh, my God. I came all this way and I don't even know what to ask. Well, you've got, like, two minutes. Okay can you tell him that I miss him very much? And ask if he's okay. Okay. Why wouldn't I be? It is him, isn't it? Okay, can he see me? Can you ask if he's here? I'm always with you. It's him, isn't it? Okay, well, can you tell him that I'm sorry? Tell him it was my fault? What are you sorry for? Okay, so you've got, like, 15 seconds. Oh can you tell him that I miss... I will miss him every single day of my life and that I cannot wait to see him again. Why do you miss me? So, what does he mean, "Why?" Sorry. Okay. The day he died, I... Before I even knew what had happened, I got a phone call to say that it was bad news, that... That he had brain cancer. I mean, how do you tell someone that? Then I didn't have to, because the next phone call that I received... Was from a complete stranger using his phone to say that he'd been in an accident. Sorry. I guess you've spoken to someone that you've lost. Yeah. Yeah, with my granddad. Oh. Bit weird, 'cause I didn't know him when he was alive, but... No one else. Yeah, if you don't mind... What were you sorry for? John used to get these really bad migraines. That meant that his vision would be blurred, and, I mean, we know what that was now. And I was really busy doing something stupidly trivial, I can't even remember what, and he was badgering me for a lift, and I said... "No." And he got in the car, and he went anyway. If it's any consolation, they never seem to know how they've died. And most of the time they don't even know that they have. - Thank you. - That's okay. What was that? What? Now we have weirdos turning up at our house. Oh, Emily. I mean, you could have said I was out. Are you gonna talk? Are you... Are you gonna let me without cutting me off? Ryan, that can't happen again. What can't? You're blaming me for that? Ryan, what is this costing us? Oh, yeah, great. It's about the money now. I mean, we're not even in the overdraft, Em. Really? Yeah, well... yeah, well, maybe, I don't know. It'd be paid by the end of the month, but you're the one who told me not to take her money. What else is it costing us? Oh, please do not make that face. It's getting worse. Every day you come home and you go straight into the garage. If I see you on the weekend, it's because you feel you have to. No, it's not because I feel I have to. Okay, fine. Okay. All right, I'm sorry. Look, what I'm doing down there's important. I get that. But maybe I need you right now. I love you. You know that. - But? - I'm just so close. You've been so close for months. I just want some balance. Wouldn't it be quicker if you took it back to the uni? That's not the point, okay? I told you why. But you can't tell me it's not dangerous. You think I'd be working on it here if it were? I had another prank call again today. That's... It was a bunch of kids this time. I'll just change the number on the poster to mine. Samantha! Sam! Samantha! Sam! Samantha! Isn't it Friday yet? It feels like it should be. Have you seen who's in today? Yep. Just saying. - Why are you smirking? - I'm not. I just find it funny that you keep going on about it. Em. You got a sec? Yeah. Off you go. Okay. Hey. Right. How's everything? Not bad. Well, you look like you could do with a break. I'm fine. You finishing at five? I think probably 5:30. I've got some time to make up. Well, did you wanna go for a drink later? We've been through this. Look, it is just a drink, okay? I promise. Yeah, I don't think I'm... I probably won't finish on time, and... Look, just think about it, okay? It's only a drink. Okay. How do you feel this week's been going? It's been hard. I think we've both been more stressed than normal. - Sorry. - It's okay. Take a minute. How about you, Ryan? Yeah, we've been told that everything possible's been done to find her, but in reality, they've all but given up. I don't think that's totally true. Regardless of it being true or not, your perception of it must make you feel frustrated. I mean, we've given them enough chances to prove otherwise, haven't we? It was her birthday last week. I bought her a cake. I don't know why. I... I didn't even get it out of the car. That must have been very difficult. For both of you. Yeah, of course. Of course it is. Do you feel like you can communicate with each other? - Yeah. - No. - Yeah, we talk. - No. I know what you mean. It's... It's superficial. We... Ryan actually prefers to deal with things by himself. I just don't wanna cause an argument. It's... How do you see your future? Maybe not talk about it now. But I want you both to think about it. We need to find a way to break this non-communicative loop. Got the auditors coming in next week. They want a breakdown of everything in B-12. That's the hazardous storage. Yeah, is that cool? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's fine. You look like crap. Yeah. Yeah, I know. This must be something with the air pressure or something. I'm getting these bloody headaches. Well, maybe you need some new contacts. That's what was causing mine. Well, that, and Emma's excuse for music. - How is she? - Oh, good. Pain in the ass, but good. Doesn't listen to a thing me and Maureen tell her. So she takes after you. Oh, she has some of Sam's old books. Do you want me to bring them in? No. You're all right. She can keep them. Okay, great. I'll let her know. I think she'll like that. Listen, you know you said if there was anything you could do? I was waiting for this. You always do that awkward hovering around thing like a kid waiting for a biscuit. You know, Jamal said he can cover my lectures next week. If I do, then there'll be even more chatter about preferential treatment. Yeah, well, my daughter's missing. Don't. You know full well that's not what I mean. Yeah, two days, all right? Give you two days. Okay, thank you. - How's it coming along? - What? I mean, okay. Yeah, I mean, we've still got a bit of a problem with the power, but I think I made some pretty positive progress. With a bit of focus, it'll be sorted. You know how to get more focus, don't you? Bring it in house. - Bring it in here. - I mean, what'll happen if I do? It's gonna slow me down. It won't slow you down, and you know it. Look, the uni are starting to lean on me, okay? They want some assurances around the safety and possible damage to its reputation. How am I gonna damage their reputation? They want me just to take a look. Okay, well, then tell them that you've seen it. I'm not gonna bring it in house. Could be a red tape nightmare. It's not gonna happen, all right? It's safe. Well, if you're so confident about it, there shouldn't be an issue with me seeing it. Okay, was that your best chat-up line? Sir, I'm really sorry. I'm know I've got to get my work in this week. Well, I mean, it's getting to be a bit of a habit, Alex. Oh, that's not fair. I just want another couple days - to sharpen the conclusions. - Yeah, okay. I'm sure they're fine, okay? Oh, Christ. Okay. Okay, but if I give you more time, I'm expecting something special. Understood. It will be. I'll catch you later. Thank you for coming tonight. Where do we go when we die? Our bodies stay here, but our consciousness... Our soul, spirit, whatever you wanna call it, we now know that it doesn't just... switch off. I first discovered an infinitely complex amount of... well, let's just call it noise... sort of floating around us. It's literally everywhere. And tests showed that this noise forms strings of information. But it was operating at a level that we couldn't currently reach. Until now. The answer was to punch a hole to where that data originated from, and that is where this comes in. What we discovered was somewhat... of a surprise. Okay, but that's enough of me talking, though. Do we have a volunteer? Okay, don't be shy. Anyone. Okay, you. Great. Hi. Hi, my name's Ryan. What's your name? Claire. Yeah. Okay, nice to meet you, Claire. Who is it that you'd like to speak with? My son, Michael. Oh. Okay. Okay, let's see what we can do. You... Now, can you just... Can you just rub that on the inside of your cheek? Okay... You ready? Okay, just... You can say whatever you like. Hi. Mom? Oh, my God. Michael. Are you okay? Am I in trouble? No, no, no. You're not in trouble. I'm sorry we're not with you. Where are you? I'm right here. Mommy? Can you hear me? Is Dad with you? - No, Dad's at home, but... - I'm at home. What do you mean? Michael? What do you mean? What is he saying? Great, thank you. There we go. Thank you. Interesting show. Yeah, I didn't know you were coming. Well, I didn't know you were doing this on the side, but one of the students told me. Is that okay? Listen, are you gonna be in tomorrow? Well yeah, yeah. In the afternoon, yeah. Okay, great. Well, I'll see you at one. Ryan, have you used it to speak to her? I still haven't spoken to her, Em. - But you've tried? - I'll see you at home, okay? Do you know what time it is? Yeah. Oh, shit. You are as bad as her. So she got up, got dressed, and then she fell asleep again on her bed. I gave her an extra ten. Well, she's not tired, I reckon. She should be going in. Oh, Ryan, I think... Yeah, I think getting out will do us some good. Well, she doesn't look great, Em. I know. Let's just see how she gets on. She really wants to go in? Cripes, what kid wants to go to school? I know. She really misses her friends, I think. Well, she's speaking to Emma basically ever night. - Well, that's true. - Anyway. - I gotta go, okay? - Okay. - Love you. - Love you. Oh, no. Oh, we have to go. Sam? Sam, love, can you... We have to go. Can you lock up as you come out? I'll wait for you in the car. Come on. We're gonna be late. Here. Who's picking me up today? Your dad, and he's gonna be on time, okay? Can you? 'Cause, I mean, that just sounds like more empty words. I mean, what are you actually doing? 'Cause we haven't heard anything in months. Most of the time we don't even get a call back. Well, first of all, that's not acceptable, and I'm sorry, but I'm just being honest with you. We haven't stopped looking. Listen, I don't mean to be shitty with you. Okay? And this isn't really personal. What are you doing? Let me turn it around. - What do you want us to do? - Well, okay. Okay, well, what about the man outside the gates? There was a man seen outside the gates of her school the day she went missing. I think that's a pretty good place to start, - don't you? - We've been through this how many times now? I don't really understand that there isn't any information. Well, there's no CCTV or anything? No, the man was stood at least 50 meters away from the girl that saw him. Please believe me. I am pushing my team as hard as you would. Okay, well, do you have kids? I don't know why that's relevant. Well, do you? Yes. Well, if you were me, what would you be doing? I would be sitting here as you are. Yeah. You know, I just want to find her, so... Ryan. Ryan. We will keep pushing until we get some answers. I promise. Hi. You all right? Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. I just came down, sorry, to get some paint for the skirting boards. It's just there. Yes. Cool. Oh, how did it go? Shit. That good? So do you believe it works now? It doesn't change the way I feel about it. I mean, well, you won't be saying that when you need a golf buddy to get from one side of our estate to the other. You're a dickhead. Yeah, I know. Here, come here. Oh, you're so hot. Yeah, I know. I don't know. Well, you feel like you've been in an oven. You know the woman last night? Her kid, it's been bugging me all night. She said he had all the same symptoms as Sam. Yeah. And she said at first he couldn't really sleep very well and he had some blotchy red skin and all that. I dunno. It's the way she described it, but... Did they find out what it was with him? No, I didn't really want to ask. How are we both? Yeah, fine. Good. I'll leave you to it. Well, that was interesting last night. Yeah. Yeah, thanks for coming. "Build it and they will come." "Field of Dreams." What do you want, Laurie? Oh, Ryan, it's out of my hands now. They've told me either you show it to me and I sign off on it, or that you go, and I don't wanna do that. Detachable keyboard. - Yeah. - Very nice. Yeah. Yeah, I don't actually know how that happened, really I found it on the floor amid my notes and stuff. - The alarm hadn't even gone off. - What, like a ghost? Yeah, I mean, apart from the fact I don't really believe in ghosts. That's a strange perspective to have. You know, what's weird about it is it happened on the day Sam when missing. Well, it's gotta be connected, you know? Yeah, I don't really understand how it can be, but I don't know. You know, I've actually got that thing there. A camera up there. It helps me out in my experiments, because it's pretty good if anything strange happens. I've actually been making a few tweaks to the machine this morning. Help me get the run time up to about four minutes. Okay, so you said last night that this, it punctures a hole, right? To communicate to wherever? Yeah, more sort of rips a tunnel, in reality. Right, okay, so what are the chances this would mean more than a voice could come through? I mean, yeah, I've thought about it. And? I don't know. I mean, there's a lot I don't know at the minute, so... Actually, could you just move that? The machine links to a person that you want to speak with. Creates a signal. You know, what's interesting is it's only really - the last 10% that reacts. - Okay, I think I follow. Yeah, and then of that, it's roughly sort of four percent that we can connect to, but... - It's intermittent. - Right. Yeah. Honestly, I can't work out why. But what... should we see if we can connect to the signal closest to the end? Okay. Yeah, okay. Pop these on. Are you ready? Well, that's something! I wouldn't do that. Yeah. Your electric meter must be an absolute meltdown. How are you powering this? Could you just rub one of these on the inside of your cheek? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, yeah. Just bring that here. You wanted to see it. Hello? Hello? Who is this? John. Where am I? John who? John Quinn. - Am I dreaming? - Turn it off. - Laurie, what's wrong? - Ryan, shut it off. No, sometimes they just get a bit confused. It's not confused. Just turn it off. - Okay, I'll just turn it down... - Turn it off! Mom. Mom, it's me. Could you pass the phone over to Dad, please? How long ago? Can you just wake him up? I'll wait. It's fine. Mom? Okay, I'm on my way. Stay where you are. Laurie, are you... He'd been ill for a while, so... You okay? Do you want me to drive you? I'll... I'll see you next week. I'm gonna need all the documentation you have on this. Mr. Harrison? Yeah. - How you doing? - Hey. Yeah, hang on. You used to play , didn't you? A few games, but my knee had other ideas. Right. I think we played against you a couple of times. - Yeah. - You still playing? No. No, not anymore. So... How can I help? Well, thank you for seeing me again. I know you were Sam's teacher, were you? No, no, she is in the year below. She would have been in my class this year. - You know who she is? - Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's a small school, you know. I covered a couple of her classes. And actually I just wanted to you give you some work she did. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry, I know you've probably - been through all this already. - That's fine. - I did speak to the police. - I know, yeah. Sorry to be a pain. I just thought if you could go over all of that again, you know? That's all. Yeah, won't take long. It was a normal day. I... I saw her leave through the main gates because it was my day on duty. - Duty? - Yeah. You know, the last man standing. On duty. Make sure the kids all get picked up. Okay, so did you see her get picked up? Kind of. She was talking to a guy with joggers and looked like a gray hoodie. - It was strange. - Strange? Strange, but you didn't think to see what was going on? Maybe not strange. That's not what I meant. Just unusual. Okay, well, was she nervous or anything? No, no, no, no. Not at all. I mean, that's why I didn't go out. I mean, I can't say I was paying attention. I thought it might have been you, but he was quite scruffy. I went back out and they were gone. Okay, well I don't mean to sound rude, okay? But what do you mean you weren't paying attention? I thought it was someone she knew. Listen, I'm sorry, but I told the police this already. Okay, well, its sounds like if you were doing your job then none of this would have happened Wait a second! I'm really sorry, okay? I may have made a mistake, but we can't check on every child been collected. - I wish we could. - Yeah, yeah, well, You only have mine to watch Listen to me, I'm not gonna be lectured by you - I feel guilty enough. - What? You only had one kid to collect from school. It's not my fault you couldn't be there on time! - Oh, yeah, really? - Right. I've got nothing more to say. Your partner arrived about ten minutes later, and that's when we realized what had happened. Sam? Sam, can you hear me? Samantha. Dad? What's up? Sam? Sam, can you hear me? Listen, Sam. I need you to describe where you are. Okay? What can you see? Where's Mom? What can you see, Sam? It's dark. There's a really bright light in front of me. I can't look at it. Okay, Sam, this is really important. Okay, I need you to tell me who you were with outside of the school, okay? Can you do that? Can't go to school. You did. You did. Just think. I don't know. Listen, it's really important, Sam. Please. Dad. Is that you in the light? Listen, I need you to tell me what you can remember. Why am I here? Dad? No, hey, Sam, I am right here, okay? I'm right here, okay? You just need to tell me what you can remember. The light's getting dimmer. Just tell me what happened outside school. Please. Do you want anything? If you aren't better by tomorrow, then I'm gonna take you to hospital. I'll just put this here. - She's not drinking. - Yeah, I know. It's... It's like she's got a fever, but her temperature's fine, and she keeps, like, muttering, but I can't understand what she's saying. I think maybe I'll work from home tomorrow. Yeah, that would be good. I was searching online, and I couldn't find her symptoms. - Is that bad? - Look, I told you not to. I know, but... What's wrong? She still in a mood with me? I don't think that's at the forefront of her mind right now. Maybe I shouldn't have been so hard on her. Well, that's not why she's ill. So we'll just see how she's doing tomorrow. - Okay. - Where are you going? Just to the garage for half an hour. It's never half an hour. Well, you won't be saying that when I get it working. Well, you don't even know what it does. Well, I will be the first to know. And you will be the second if you bring a coffee down. Oh. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. Just trying to sort this bloody power problem out. How many times has that thing blown up or crashed or whatever? Maybe it just doesn't want to exist. It's a machine, Em, so... You spend so much time in here, you could at least keep it tidy. Yeah, well, I know where everything is, so... - Yeah, but it's like a mess. - Hey, whoa, whoa. - What, what? - Yeah, I'll take that. - It's empty. - Yeah, I know. Just leave it to me. Ryan, what are we gonna do? About? Everything. She is alive, isn't she? So how about we have a proper meal tonight? Oh. Okay, yeah. Where are you gonna take me? I didn't say I was gonna take you anywhere, did I? What, do you think I'm made of money? What, so, are you cooking, then? That's more ridiculous. Yeah, okay. Takeaway it is. Hey. Yeah, I know. What, that was today? Yeah, sorry, yeah. Yeah. I'll be there. Bye. Bye. Sorry. - Tonight. - Yeah. Yeah. Why are you here? Sorry, I overslept, so... Oh, no. I wouldn't bother. Listen, Laurie, I'm sorry about your dad. I know what you've been doing. Wait, what? I know you took my card and I know what you used it for. Yeah, well, I didn't steal your card, for Christ's sake. Know when to back down. I've been covering for you. If I didn't, this would be a criminal investigation. There is CCTV all over the place. Okay, well, I need more. This is why you didn't tell me what you were powering it with, isn't it? There is a reason it is a licensed chemical. I'm sure you haven't told Emily how dangerous this is. In the grand scheme of things, I don't think it's a problem. Now, I know what I'm doing. I'm not an idiot. No, just reckless. Well, nothing was achieved without a bit of risk. You can pack your stuff and go. Sorry, what? Leave your card at reception and leave. You know, I spoke to her. Sam? Yeah. I'm... So sorry. What'd she say? She couldn't remember what happened just like everyone else, so... You told Emily, right? Not yet, no. You cannot keep this from her. She deserves to know. Listen, Laurie, are you gonna help? No. No, it doesn't change anything, and you're lucky that I'm not taking this further. - I thought we were friends. - So did I. I guess we were both wrong. Now, you need to go and tell Emily the truth, because I am not gonna let you kill yourself! Hey, could you just let me in here, please, mate? I left my card in with my phone again. - I got this bloody audit. - Doing the audit? Then you really need to be using your own card. Okay. I don't think that's really a problem, though, is it? If you take it down to reception - they'll sort it in 30 seconds. - Okay. Well, there's a new girl on reception. She don't know what to do, so... Okay, okay. Thank you. Where's Mom? Wake up. Did I fall asleep? Yeah, again. Who's she talking to? I don't know. - Oh, wow, that was good. - Mmm. I haven't had food in here in ages. Mm. It's nice. You're very brave wearing a white shirt. Oh, no, just, food never really misses my mouth. Okay, that's good. So how is your work? I don't know. Actually, maybe I need a change. I don't know. You? It's busy. Steve thinks that there might be reorganization. Yeah, he said that there would be, so that would be good for me. That would be good for you, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the change is good, 'cause things could get stale. You remember when we moved in here and Sam made all these castles out of boxes? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, my... there was one in every room. Yeah, no, no. There wasn't one in the kitchen, I don't think. - No, yeah, there was. - Was there? - Yeah, you just didn't see it. - Oh, okay. Yeah. It was very small. Oh, must have been small. Mm. You know earlier you were asking if Sam was... - Wasn't still here. - Ryan... I just think we need to entertain that possibility. No, I really want to change the subject. Sorry... - I was testing the machine and... - No. We're having a really nice evening, so that means we're not gonna talk about that. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah. You smell of curry. So do you. It's gonna be okay. It just feels like everything's slipping away. I'm so scared of losing you, too. That isn't gonna happen. I mean, do you reckon that'd work? Yeah. I mean, if I send over the program, can you take a look? Yeah, I mean, it will reduce the run time, but I reckon it'll work on a much wider spectrum than just sound, so... Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah, great. Thanks. Okay, let's see if this makes a difference. Hey. Sam. Sam. I'm tired. Oh, listen. We miss you so much. Dad, I don't understand. I'm right here. It's okay. Look, don't worry about that now, okay? Are you angry at me? No, of course not. Why would I be? Then why are you at work so much? Don't you wanna be at home? No. Oh, no, of course not. Course not. I shouldn't be there so much. You know, that's my fault, okay? - That's not yours. - Mom said we'd seen more of the invisible man than you. Did she? Listen, you're the most important thing in the world to me and your mom. So you gonna be around more? Well, that's the plan. Listen, listen. I need you to answer some questions for me, Sam, okay? Can you do that? I think so. - Where's mom? - She's... She's at work at the minute. She'll be back soon. Why can't I see you, Dad? Hey. Hey, hey, listen. Don't worry about that. All right, can you just answer - these questions, Sam, okay? - Yes. I need you to think really hard. Who did you go with after school, Sam? After school? When? When you left us, Sam. What are you talking about? I never went anywhere. Hey, hey. Hey. Shit. Hey, Emma. Hey, I'm Sam's dad. I know. Listen, you have all the same lessons as Sam, right? You know, I'm just trying to work out what's happened, okay? I think maybe you could help. Did Sam say anything about speaking to anybody? No. She didn't wanna talk about it. Hey, wait, what? Nothing. No, come on. What is it? At lunch break, she was talking to somebody at the gate. Okay, who? Was it a man? Had you seen him before? No, and she didn't wanna talk about it. What, Sam didn't say anything about him? - I need to get home now. - No, listen. Did you tell the police about that? - Did they even ask? - I don't know. It was ages ago. Okay, well, what did he look like? Okay, before you go, just tell me that. Tall, I think. Maybe dark hair. I'm sorry. - That's all I remember. - No, no, listen. You won't get in any more trouble, okay? Is there anything else you're not telling me? Hey, Emma, Emma. Okay, Emma! Emma! Emma, no, I can give you a lift home, okay? Emma, I know where you live! It's... Hey, sorry. Sorry I'm so late. Is Ryan not here yet? No, I'm afraid not. Right. Do you want to reschedule? I just... Back to the start. Just when it felt like we were really getting somewhere. This is a couple's session. I think it would be better to reschedule for when you're both in the room. No, actually, don't worry about that. I don't think we're gonna be coming back. That's not because of you. I know what you mean. It's okay. It's just like you said. Like... Something has to change for us to break out of this loop. Maybe you should call him. Maybe he's got a good reason. No, he hasn't. Who was that at break? Nobody. It looked like somebody. You all right? So you coming 'round tomorrow? Yeah, but I need to check with Mom. Can I meet you here tomorrow? Yeah, okay. See you. Sam. Dad? Sam. Hey, Sam. Sam. Sam. How did I get here? Look, don't worry about that, okay? You're here now. I was just... I should be at school. Hey, hey, are you okay? My head hurts. Okay, just sit yourself down, Sam. - I feel so strange. - Hey. No, it's gonna be okay, Sam. Okay? It's gonna be okay. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. Is Mom home? No, not yet. No, she's at work, okay? She'll be home soon, though. Yeah? Can I go to bed? Hey. Wait, hey, wait. Are you tired? Why is it doing that? It's okay. We need to get you upstairs, okay? Let's go. Come on. Hey. Hey, come here. Listen, you're mom's gonna be home soon. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. So, go on, then. Why are you here? Because you kept asking me. You're right. Yeah, I did, yeah. Yeah. No, I've had enough, and I need to drive. - I need to drive home. - Aw. - Do you, though? - Yes, I do. Can you put it down? This is a very bad idea. Do you ever think about if things were different between us? No, no, no, no, no. So why are you here, then? I dunno, Steve. Sure? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. I don't know. Okay, so what about what's-his-face? - Does he know you're here? - Yes. No, he doesn't. Why didn't you tell him? Because I don't need to. I didn't mean about tonight. Well, no, well, because nothing positive is gonna come from that. Kind of feel like he should know, though. No. Okay, this is a mistake. I have to go. Okay, so what about if I told him? - Don't you dare! - Oh, calm down, woman. Get off me! Calm down... Don't threaten me, and you had no interest in her, Steve! - Why suddenly now? - Threaten you? Just, Steve, can you stay away from me, and stay away from my family? You took my daughter away, and then you make out - like I'm the bad guy. - Your daughter? Are you suddenly telling me that you wanted kids? Come on. Well, there is a difference between me telling you that I didn't want kids and you not even giving me a choice. I wanted her to have a real dad, okay? Not somebody who just felt guilty. Yeah, well, either way, it's pretty messed up. I thought you'd be grateful I was giving you a way out. Yeah, well, you sure did. If you say so. Okay, let's see where you were. Ryan? Ryan! Oh! Ryan? Ryan, what are you... what are you doing? Sam? Sam, love, can you... We have to go. Can you lock up as you come out? I'll wait for you in the car. Why can't I see you? Are you there? I know. I'm late. Hey, wait. Sam, where are you going? Sam. Okay. Okay. Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Oh, wha... Oh, my... Ryan? Ryan! So you coming 'round tomorrow? Yeah, but I need to check with Mom. Can I meet you here tomorrow? Yeah, okay. - See you. - Bye. Hey, Sam. Sam. - Dad, where's the car? - Hey, no. Don't worry about that, okay? We gotta go. Come here. What's going on, Dad? Listen, Sam, I can't explain right now, all right? But we need to get home. Okay, come on. Sam? Sam? Sam? Sam! Sam! Yeah, yeah, but I've been driving around for the last two hours. Oh, my God. What did you do? Em, I didn't know. Ryan, what's happened to her? I tried to stop it, Em. Ryan, what's happening? I didn't know what it did. I should have listened to you, Em. What do you mean? You need to explain, because none of this makes any sense. It's hard to. Well, try! I... Em, I couldn't work out why some parts of the signal were stronger than others. I think... I think this is whenever we've spoken to someone, and they were asleep. Asleep? I'm not speaking to people who are dead, Emma. I'm speaking to people who were asleep. But they were all dead. Not when I spoke to them, Em. The machine, Em, is tuned to brainwaves. The kind that are more active when you're asleep. You know, this thing doesn't punch a hole into the afterlife. It creates a link to the past. Did you speak to Sam? I didn't know. You spoke to her! You spoke to her and you didn't tell me! - No, I tried to tell you. - I am not having that, Ryan. It wasn't that easy. Are you... Besides, we've both got our secrets, haven't we? What is that supposed to mean? It means I know why my DNA didn't work! Oh, my God. Hey, none of that matters now, anyway. What is this? Just turn it on. This room has trace levels all over it. I think whenever I've used it, a small amount has been given off here, but I think I locked to whoever I've spoken to. And that's what killed them. If you hadn't spoken to them, none of them would be dead? Well, it seems that way. How many times did you speak to Sam? Enough. Oh, no! Oh, my God! How is she here? I thought the same way you could bring a sound back through the machine, you could just open a window to see her. It's not what it did. She is out there dead because of you! - I didn't know! - Oh, my G... You used it on yourself. Where did you go? I didn't know what was on the other side. Where did it take you? To the day she disappeared. - I tried to stop it, Em. - Do it. Do it again. Try again. - It won't work. - If you won't, then I will. Em, it won't work, okay? Just stop. Stop! Stop and look what it's done to me! It's killed her! It's killed Sam! I don't... What, you go back, what are you gonna do? I can't guarantee what's gonna happen, Em. Look. You're gonna end up like me. I can't even speak to anybody in the past without it killing them. What are you doing? Em, if I can't speak to someone, I can speak to something. Ryan. Listen, I think we'd better pack up, okay? - I'll see you at work. - Wait. - Look at this. - What? That's just readings from the probe. Want me to boost it? Yeah. Yeah, keep going to 120. Can you pass me this? Hello? Ryan, you're gonna recognize this voice, because it's yours. Oh, my God. And you're gonna listen very carefully to what I'm gonna say to you. Who are you? Listen, we're recording on this, right? Yeah. It's all still running. Okay.
