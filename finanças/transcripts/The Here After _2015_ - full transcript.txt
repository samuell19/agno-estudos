That looks fine. This is going to work out. You can wait here. There. You can come in, John. Stop it! The salesman said you'd like it. How would HE know? He said that all the spoiled brats have one of those. How's Grandpa? He's fine. When's he coming home? I'm not sure. Hey, put your seat-belt on. What the hell are you doing? I told you to put your seat-belt on! OK then!... Take it easy! So, is that OK? Yes. Fine. Will you open the doors? - Sorry, have you been waiting long? - You could say that. You drive round and I'll take the tractor. Philip, for fuck's sake, stop that! You can’t stand pissing there. No, but let me finish this piss. Come on now! There are toilets inside. - Where's John? - Inside. John! John? John John? - Let me go! Let me go! - No! Let me go! - You OK? - Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, I said! - Can't you say hello, like everyone else? - Hello. How are you going? Fine. You? Bad, when you carry on like that. Cut the meat. Don't rip it apart. That's why you've got a knife. - Too late now. - Yeah. Well, do it with your potatoes. Welcome home. - Thanks. - Welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. Did they have a farewell party for you? - No. - Why not? - Didn't you have any friends? - Sure I did. - Did you drop the soap in the shower? - Philip! I only asked if he dropped the soap in the shower. - You're being silly. - Am I being silly? I saw Kim the other day. You're sure to be in the same class. The new headmistress seems very good. What's her name... Anna-Karin. And yes... Do you know how to make a cat bark like a dog? You douse it in petrol and light a match... Woof! More acceleration... more! No... but... Hop out, I'll take it... Hop out! Bloody hell! I'll go and get the Deere. Careful! Daddy! - Can we have Cola. - No. - Go on, please! - No! We'll leave now. Daddy! Daddy!... Quickly! What the hell?! - Let me go! - Get out! Get out! Don't you touch him! Don't you touch him! Lunch's ready. John, lunch is ready. Try and eat properly, now. Hello!... Open the door! Open the door! John, open the door. Take a seat. And use your knife and fork when you eat. The napkin on your lap. We don't behave like that in this house. I'd say you don't want me here. Of course I do... But you must be able to behave, John. - You must make the effort. - I'll try. Try a bit harder! You've reached the Rцnnerman family. Sorry, we aren't available just now. I'm working at 70% now, so that's good. I feel I'm ready. We were only supposed to go away for a weekend. Just talk and catch up a little. I don't think it's too early. I feel ready. It's not like I want a double bed or something! It's just that... ...I miss you. I have to go. I can ring later. He's been released. I saw him today. You have to get away from there. Bea, you can't go on living there. Hello? Hello? Bea? Hi! There's food in the fridge. Hello? What do you want? I don't know what you're talking about. He was home with me the whole evening. Stop screaming! Stop it! Bye! I'm going to bed... Goodnight. Goodnight. Damn it! Get off, Philip. John, the bus is coming. Quick then!... John.. quick! It must be lovely being home again. I can imagine. All's well with your dad? Yeah. He's a good man Excuse me, I had to have a coffee. There you are. Hi... John. Hi. Robert here is your form teacher. Whatever you need or want to talk about, you come to me. I was surprised when I heard that you wanted to register here again. But you have every right to... And you've had good results. Impressive, considering the circumstances. We just want this to be a quiet place. If anything happens, of course we'd have to act. Well, it's time to get started. - The lesson - Yes, exactly On the left. Make some room. We have a... We have a new pupil in the class... John, would you stand? Welcome! Some of you know John. If he has any problems understanding what we're doing... ...what we're working on... it's just a matter of helping him. Bella, would you get her, please? So we'll start with a little... I don't think he should be here, either! That's nothing to discuss now. I'm just saying what I believe everyone thinks. - Did you hear what I just said? - Yes, I heard. - I have a maths problem for you all. - He should be out of here! Everyone has a right to learn. Everyone. What? - Everyone has a right to life. - Outside! Did you hear what I said? Outside! - Get out of here! - Don't touch me! Then get out! Oopsy daisy! Here's a cloth. Nobody naked? Hampus, don't you put the gym mat away? - No, that's Erik. - But Erik's left, hasn't he? - Then you come and take it. - Why? Don't quibble... they can't start their game. Hurry up. You have to get used to picking up after you. Hi, Kim Dad didn't want me to talk to you. That's why I didn't come. "It hurts... it hurts even more..." - I hope you're being nice to each other. - Wasn't that what she said? I thought I was in the wrong place. "It hurts... it hurts even more..." Cut it out I said!... I can't drive! You're being nasty to each other! Now calm down! Where are you going? What do you want? Did you tell her that you'd seen me? No. What are you doing? Give me the key! - She rang me at home. - And? Give me the key! What should I care? I never fucking knew that girl! Give me the key! Now! What did you do there? Can you get up? Up you get! Stay there. What the fuck!?... Here... You can put some underpants on. No! Stop... stop... NO! There's yours. How are you, Grandpa? Didn't you like the food? Eat your dinner, Philip. I forgot my exercising. What's that? The ones you did when you were little. Not now Philip. Yes, go on! Go on!... ...or I won't eat my dinner. If you don't help me with it, I won't eat my dinner. Sit up in your chair properly... That's the way. Look... That requires some practice. Grandpa... What's that?... Let me see! You haven't got...? What the devil...?! You're not to eat this stuff! Just do what the doctor tells you. Wipe your mouth. Keep to the right. You're driving in the centre. There aren't any cars coming. No... but concentrate. - What are you two up to? - He's pinching me! Cut it out! Go a bit faster... fine. Trousers? Trousers? Why don't you have everything in the same place? OK, it’s your turn. Try to hit on the way up. OK. Keep your cheek against the butt. Push it against you. Bend a bit... Knees bent. That's it. How was school? Fine. Didn't you learn you should stay away from girls? Or wasn't two years enough? A death sentence! Hey...! Why didn't you hit back? Hey! - Then I'd be expelled. - Wouldn't that be better? - No. - Why not? - Why not? - Because I don't want to be alone! Fucking hell! What have you done?!? I don't know. I can fix it, if you like. - Hi, John. - Hi. How are you going? Fine. Kim said you were back... and had started school. Isn't that great? - Bye. - Bye. - Hi, Kim. - Hi. Do you know each other? We're in the same class. I see. You never told me you had such a pretty girl in your class. Nice to see you again, John. We must be on our way. Right, chief? Put her in gear. Say hi to Martin. Gently now! Treat her like a lady... ...just with the gearstick. Bye. Put it in here. When did you move here? Last summer. Can you hold it from behind? There. Are you holding it? Is it true that Kim screwed that girl, while you were still together? No. What? We'd finished. When? Some days before. Wipe that off. So she was never unfaithful?? No. But he did screw her, didn't he? Yeah. So, why did you do it? I got angry. Why weren't you angry with Kim? It wasn't the same thing. Why not? Were you in love with her? They said it was like I was sleepwalking... That I didn't know what I was doing. But I remember everything How did it feel? I didn't feel anything. Show me! Show me how you did it. It tickles. You should be wearing a helmet. Poor thing. How old is he? We'll have to ring the vet. I'll google the number.. Grandpa, what are you doing?! No! You goddamned stupid old man!... Fuck you! What are you doing? You've got a hole there. So I can poke it. You've got a hole, too... so I can poke it. John, would you come down here? Do you have anything more down here? What? What? I don't know what you mean. If you can shoot dogs, you can fend for yourself. What do you want? Hi. Malin. Hi, Martin. Hi, Philip. What's happening? We're taking Grandpa home, if you'd like to say hi. Hi. Do you think it's alright to shoot a dog like that? It was nearly dead anyway. You're really sick, too. Enough of that, Philip! - Are you going to kill her, too? -F p! Go and wait in the car. Philip? You'll have to excuse us. I need to explain to you what the situation is. I've received a list of 270 names from the student body. They want John to change schools. I thought you should know. - How many students do you have? - 303. Each signature is approved by a parent or guardian. I haven't done anything wrong. Many find it difficult just having to see you every day. Couldn't you talk to him? Yes. Thanks, anyway. Is Philip home? No. Didn't he get the bus? No. Please... no, John. Don't you want some pizza? Call me if he comes home. OK. Philip? Philip!... Philip! What? - Time to come home, now. - No! Come on now! Philip! Come on! Drop the ball. I said drop the ball! He doesn't want to go. Let me go! Let him alone... He doesn't want to. I don't want to go home. You know we can report you?! - Goddamned bitch! - Shut up! Let me go! Get in Take your fucking family and piss off! Piss off! Let the kid come out if he wants to. Belt up! - I don't want to go home. - Put your seatbelt on! Take your murdering kid and piss off! Fucking murderer! Now you listen to me!. I don't wanna be home. You listen to me and come along. Stay down here Philip... Just stay there! - Why? - Because I said so... now sit down! What are you doing? Malin... I'm sorry, but it's best you go, alright? Sure. What for? Please, Malin. - It's alright. - No, stay! What is it? I have to talk to you now. Alright? - I'll go, then. - Sit down! Why does she have to go? - Let go of me. - Be quiet! - Let her go, John. - Shut it! What do you want? Let her go. Why should I? I... What? It was wrong of me to let you move home again. It was a mistake. MY fault. So, where's he supposed to go? I don't know. But you're his dad... Of course he wants to be with you. - He doesn't like to be alone. - Be quiet! Philip... come on! Drive! Your dad's driving me home. Come on. What do you want, then? Help me! Hit him! Hit him again!. Hit him! Fucking cunt! Stay there! Lie down! What are you doing? Stay there! - Are you crazy? - He came at us. You're sick in the head. He needs help. Give it back. Give me the phone! - Did you hear? He attacked us. - He needs help! You don't know what this is about! He attacked us. - He needs help! - You don't know what this is about! John? John... - How are you? - Go away! -Hi! -Hi! How you going? Good. - Are you coming home? - No. John... Any bones broken? I don't think so. Sit down, John. Where's his dad, then? He's not coming. No?... Why not? He couldn't get away. I spoke with him on the phone. The window problem, then. We do have a bit more to talk about than the windows, don't we? What happened yesterday happened in the school area... ...and witnessed by a teacher... It has to be resolved. I want us to do that now. Your dad hasn't spoken to the police, John. Have you? No. Good. I suggest we give Kim a chance to apologise for what happened. What... now? Yes, now. I want you to respect each other just like everyone else does here at school. So why do you let HIM come back? I'm sorry? He didn't respect everyone here in school. John has been given another chance, so o has Kim. But Kim didn't murder anyone. He came close to it. What do you mean by that? Just look at him! Now let's take it easy. Would you want a police report on this?! I'm here about the windows. So how will we resolve this? I pay for the window panes and they stop fighting. I don't agree that the circumstances be dictated by him. Kim, what do you think? Do you think this is funny?! - Is Kim supposed solve this? - Yes - Can I say I'm sorry? - No... you can't! Sorry. So shake hands. Fine. So are we all good with that? You'll be welcome back to school tomorrow, Kim. Hi. You should fucking report them! Hi. Sorry. I promise I won't do it again. Say something. What the hell's that? You again, for God's sake! It just won't work. Why not? Hello!? Because I'm scared of you. Everyone's scared of you. Don't you realise that?! Up! Shoot. Shoot! Kill me! Fuck! Fuck! Clean it up. Get out of here!
