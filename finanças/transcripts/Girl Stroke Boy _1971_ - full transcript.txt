Pamela, what are you going to wear tonight? My black velvet. Black is lovely, but I think velvet might be a little warm for winter. Warm? For this winter? No, the central heating unit has gone mad. George hit it. It's like a heat wave here. I think you'd be happier in cotton. PAMELA: But what about my new kaftan? Oh, nothing new. It's not that sort of dinner party. Well, what about... Wait a minute, darling. What about my orange and lemon kaftan? Oh, not yellow and orange! It's so torrid here. What about my kaftan with the purple pattern? Pamela, you know perfectly well that it won't look good against my chairs. You must look good, for your godson. Well, what about my kaftan with the green motif? Splendid. Laurie loves green. You must be awfully excited, darling. He's only bringing the girl home for the weekend. Yes, well, it's the first time it's happened, isn't it? And she sounds such an exotic girlfriend. Pamela, you know that on the colour question, I am a pioneer. I'm making the heroine of my next book an octoroon. I've had this marvellous idea. Her mother is dead, and her poor, black father marries again, most unfortunately. He doesn't only bring home a stepmother, he brings home two hideously ugly stepsisters, too. Doesn't it, er... sound rather familiar, darling? Well, all the best stories are. The writer simply has to bring an adult attitude toward them. That's what counts. Which story does it remind you of? Oh, never mind. Of course, Laurie will appreciate the warmth after that awful clinic, poor boy. Now, don't exaggerate. My son is perfectly well. He's never really been ill. He just likes to make a fuss. George! In here. Oh, what a relief, Lettice, dear. I've been thinking about you so much during the last few days. Do you think I ought to get out Peter's bermudas? I think he might feel a little self-conscious. Oh, and don't forget, eight-thirty. Mmm. God damn the little bastards! God rot their secondary modern guts. If there was any justice in this world, he would. Nowadays, he daren't lift a finger because of the education authority. George, I've some wonderful news. Fire in the gym, a sit-in in the bogs. It's absolutely infamous. I wash my hands of them. Be careful. The water's very hot. You're damn right. George, I've just written the first words of my new book. I'm calling it He Came, He Saw, She Conquered. And I'm having a coloured heroine. Lettice, what in heaven's name have you done to this chair? Has it been connected to the mains? The room is hot. And if you glower at me like that, I'll tell you why it's hot, and whose fault it is. And the window seems to have stuck. These damn new window locks. "So burglar-proof," you said. And then you lost the key. Do what I do, and use your imagination to stay fresh. What do you think of Mandy May? She the one in the Lower Fourth? No! She's the heroine of He Came, He Saw, She Conquered. It will sell at thirty shillings and, with a good press and a bit of luck, it'll do three editions in the first year, and be a tremendous help in understanding the colour problem, which I do think is so important. I can see it's spring again. The artistic sap is rising, is it? I knew you'd be thrilled. Lettice, I want to talk to you. Sandwich lost his faith this afternoon, halfway through the Synoptic Gospels with the Lower Sixth. "Faith" or "face"? Faith. He can't teach anymore. He rent his gown from top to bottom, and bit through the hem. He's a fine teacher too. A fine teacher. Do you know what young Titmarsh had the gall to say to him? "God who?" Titmarsh said. Just that. "Do you believe in God, Titmarsh?" "God who?" Sandwich was finished. Did you dry these? A whole lifetime of religious instruction obliterated. It will have to be done again. We're not having guests. Only a handful. Pamela and Peter Havendon, and Liz, of course. Liz adores Laurie, poor, sad virgin. Izzy? Liz, idiot. If she will do that Mona Lisa smile all the time what can she expect? You want more from a woman than a fixed grin. First time I've ever heard you admit that. Why is that bird stopped in mid-suck? God knows. "God who?" Can you see this bowl if I put it here? No. But what the hell? Language. I wish I knew what you were doing, Lettice. I've had a terrible day. The water will cool the air. I left this house this morning a pleasant 60 degrees. You could see out of the windows, you could sit comfortably in the chairs. When the windows would open, the clocks worked. It all seems a long time ago. And now only the greenfly seem happy. Well, why don't you turn down the bloody central heating? I can't regulate the bloody central heating anymore. You left the switch hanging off the wall. I never touched the switch. Don't look at me like that, dear. I've lived with your shortcomings for over thirty years, and I'm not likely to walk out on you now, although the idea does have something to recommend it. You hit it. - You hit it. - I merely tapped it. And then to smash the tap, turning the oil off. Well, the instructions clearly say that you can adjust all adjustable parts. With a hammer? That must be in the small print that I can't read. These are three inches taller already. I find that awe-inspiring. Do you realise it's only our climate that keeps the jungle at bay? I must be careful what I say about the jungle this weekend. God, this diabolical thing says 85 now! Have you called the engineers? Five times, with increasing acrimony. - When are they coming to fix it? - On Monday. A whole weekend? We'll be cooked by then. Monday afternoon at the earliest. They're beyond reason. They don't work at weekends. Like all emergency services, they exist to create emergencies, not to relieve them. Are you determined to have people in? I've told the women, summer frocks. The men'll just have to suffer. Suffer?! - Relax, darling. - Bah! You must learn to get excited more calmly. George! Jo will love it. And just think, Laurie will be home soon. He's going to think it very odd, you filling the house with boring people and exotic undergrowth the first weekend he turns up with a girlfriend. A what? A girlfriend. A West Indian girlfriend. Of course, he can't be serious. But we can't afford to be narrow minded, George. The message of my work is love. The message of my life is love. I can love the beautiful black daughter of a, thank God, West Indian High Commissioner just as well as I can love a shop girl. More, probably, because the relationship is less likely to be permanent. Thank you, darling. What's wrong with calling her a girlfriend? I hope you haven't been going round saying that Laurie has a fiancée. It's not as if it was a storm warning. Laurie's having a West Indian girl home. We shall welcome her, we shall take her in our stride. But we shall never forget that he's only known her a few weeks. Laurie never does anything impetuously. It takes him an hour to shave. At least he'll find the water hot enough. I don't suppose they're even on first-name terms yet. And there you go, marrying them off. Well, let me call the Havendons and tell them what's happened. After all, the boy's only just come out of hospital. Laurie is perfectly well. Oh, come on, now. He's bonkers. Six months ago, he didn't even know me. Well, he just forgot a few things, and people. He never forgot me, though, which I thought was particularly courteous of him. If you despise your closest friends, why invite them to dinner? I don't despise my closest friends. I'm just indifferent to them. Well, I'm not opening one of my best bottles. I already have. Two. Oh, God, can't we for one night simply be ourselves? The whole point of being middle class is that you can't. - George, you haven't shaved yet. - Oh. It's a hundred in the shade. If you're made of asbestos, I'm not. I've put out your best black. You look so distinguished in it. It feels like the end of the world. All the more reason to put on a suit. All right. Only if I die of a coronary, it'll be your funeral. You'll have to wear black then, so now's a good time to get used to it. Not my favourite day. Sandwich gives up the Holy Ghost. Oh, I forgot. The head girl exposed herself to me again. If only it would lead to pneumonia. Weren't you just a little surprised when Laurie asked if he could bring her home? They couldn't send a man round, but they could sell me a fan. Aren't you just a little surprised that Laurie had a girlfriend at all? It seemed perfectly natural to me, insofar as anything does seem natural these days. He never seemed to me to be very fond of girls. He never once forgot Mother's Day. Do you know, I don't remember him bringing a single girl home all the time I've known him. What an odd way to talk about your own son. Girls were always ringing him up to ask him to parties. There was... Oh, whatshername, with the hairpins that kept on coming off. Alison someone. She would have given her right breast for him. Not that he demands sacrifice of women, or has a morbid nature. Not that she had a right breast, from what I can remember. Yes, that's the one. Mallinson... You know, woodwork and biology. Said that Laurie was the only boy in the class who never giggled during sex instruction. With Mallinson, I'd doubt it was a laughing matter. Oh, it's... It's just that I'm surprised. Oh, pleased. Yes, and rather relieved to think that Laurie's got involved with a young girl. We don't know if she is young, and I can't quite see where the relief comes in. Oh, come on now. He was going to be a bachelor. A celibate. I think you'd better put your shirt on before you take back that vile insinuation. It's so hot! Thank God I don't understand a word of your disgusting innuendos. Simply because he hasn't whored his way to manhood like the rest of his half-baked generation. Celibate! I daresay your talks to the sixth form are equally lewd. Celibate. Don't you dare use that word of our... of my child, in his... in our... in my hearing ever again. Is that clear? Celibate? Oh, is that what you said? - Well, if you thought that... - I did not. No, it can't be! Well, what time do you make it? This says five o'clock. The damn thing stopped. It's six by this. They've both stopped. I'm not ready. I have a hundred things to do. Now the handle's hot. Oh, God. Look at me, absolutely ruined. Now the damn door's stuck. We're trapped, Lettice. It won't open. If you're going to panic, I'm not not going to be able to go. Ow! My God, it's them! Laurie, darling! I didn't expect you for ages yet. Mother. No, don't pull away. I won't make a fuss. People really do do this sort of thing after a long absence. Let me look at you. - Well, I can look. - Glad to have you back. - How are you? - Fine, fine. Older, but finer, er... wiser. I've... I've lost weight, darling. Don't you think I have? You look as beautiful as ever. You never change. Outrageous, with just enough truth not to make it flattery. George, why don't you tell him how well he looks? Please, let's just get one thing straight. A weekend of being told I'm through the worst is, like, gonna put me on my back for life. I'm perfectly all right, so let's just leave it there. Why is it so bloody hot in here? Er... That's a long story. Your father, he hit the central heating. Why don't you open a window? I have made the house burglar-proof, with beautiful new locks, and your father's lost the master key. Where's, um... Jo? Couldn't she come? I'd so looked forward to meeting her. I tripped over the central heating. I'm always falling over something. I hope I haven't wrecked it. Oh, no. Jo, this is my mother. Oh, Mrs Mason, this is so exciting. I'm so happy to meet you. Laurie's told me so much about you. None of which she believes. May I? Heavens, you are warm. This is my father. Thank you for letting me come. It's wonderful to be able to get out of London and meet people. The charm may wear off. Any friend of Laurie's is a... Surprise to me. May I? You wear the same aftershave as Laurie. Oh, look, your book covers. I've read them all, Mrs Mason. My favourite is... Mother really wanted a romantic hero for a son. I must have been a terrible disappointment. This is a lovely room, Mrs Mason. Did you heat it up on purpose for me? Mother, how long has it been like this? Only since this afternoon. When the Japanese did it, it was an infringement of the Geneva Convention. You'll have me swinging from the potted plant soon. Oh! Me Tarzan! No, Jo, you Jane. Me, Tarzan. - Cologne, Mrs Mason? - Thank you, no. Oh, well, I've sloshed on enough for both of us. Dad broke the central heating. No, I merely tapped it, and it fell to pieces in my hands. I'm with you, Mr Mason. I guess it's the mud hut I grew up in. I just get in a panic seeing a screw. You're just as I imagined, Mrs Mason. I hope I'm not too much of a shock. You never used to be so short-sighted, Mother. What's wrong? Laurie, this is the beautiful Miss Delaney you wrote about? The Miss Delaney you were so anxious for us to meet? Yes. - The air hostess? - Yes, Mother. - The High Commissioner's daughter? - That's her. There are one or two things that your father wishes to ask you. No. No. I'll get the luggage. No, wait, Miss Delaney. There's no hurry. George. Jo, are you... Frightfully tired after the journey? Of course she isn't, George. Look at her. Closely. I see the table is laid for seven. You've got people coming round. How nice. Since I met Jo, I have this incredible desire to put her on show. Who's coming? Ah, I think that's what your mother wants me to explain. No-one is coming. Not a soul. - What an idea! - But, Lettice... On your first evening home in a hundred years, do you think I'd ask people round? I knew you'd be quiet, and want a tired, family evening. - That doesn't sound quite... - I'm not mad to be put on display. But, of course, I'd love to meet your friends. Thank you. - Have you forgotten... - No, George. No-one is coming to this house tonight. So why is the table laid for seven? It's laid for eight-thirty. Yes, I know, but there are seven plates. - Your father... - Don't involve me in this. That was last night. My publisher was coming to dinner with his wife and daughter, wasn't he, George? Well, he came up the M1, and then drove straight into a snow drift. I cooked and cooked all day, but they never made it. Did they, George? They were picked up by the AA, and given hot baths, and warm underclothes, and hot toddies, and taken to a hotel. Weren't they, George? That's where they telephoned us from. And they gave them hot curry and mulligatawny soup, and got them back to London in a centrally-heated train. And no-one is coming to dinner tonight. Mother, you're up to something. I know that Lady Macbeth look. George, where are you going? - To change. - Whatever for? - I'm wet. - No, stay here. George! Stay where you are. I need you here. Maybe I could see over the house. I'd really like to. Er... Have you lived here all your life? Certainly not. I had to earn it. Well, it's beautiful. It's the kind of house my mother would give her eye teeth to have. A very peculiar form of barter. I always thought it was done with beads and shells. - I, er... - Now where, George? Oh, I was just... shifting my weight. I... I thought I might try to open some of the upstairs windows. You know, to draw the hot air up and out. They're locked, too. But the walls will crack soon, so there will be a slight ventilation. Darling, I'm beginning to stick to my clothes. Do you think we could go to my room and change? Well, let's see if we can get this open. Oh, damn. - I'll try from the other side. - Good. Oh, look, can I help? That's the... girl. Yes! Oh, there we go. I'll just get the cases. I didn't expect things to be easy. Help us, Mr Mason. It looks as though we're going to need it. - My dear, I'd be only too... - We're so in love. I'd be only too pleased. It's been a full day, though. - I'm counting on you. - Oh. Here we are. I'll hump these upstairs. Tote that bag. Lift that bale. Supper still at eight-thirty? Er... On the evidence of the last thirty years, I expect so, but this evening is beginning to be a bit untypical. You didn't think I'd make it, did you? - Er... - Say nothing. It's a relief to me as well. Potatoes, dear. Why the hell did you tell 'em that we were not having people to supper? Well, we're not. No-one's getting through that door tonight. No-one's coming into my house to witness this spectacle. - Where are they? - Upstairs, changing. It is understood that no-one comes through that door tonight. Is it too late to ring them? Why did you make it get this far? Why didn't you ask them? Why didn't you speak out? I know it's not your life, but something has to be done. I'm not sure that I follow. Is that all you have to say in the face of complete social ruin? It all seemed to go very well to me. Very well? What went off very well? My broadmindedness is a by-word. Black is beautiful. I was even prepared to have a woman-to-woman talk with her, but if you can show me to what sort of which I was talking. And you said it went off well. Well, Laurie looks well, that's all I'm saying. He does not. He looks fine, and he sounds warped, and he acts with hostility to me, his only mother. He was always a bit sardonic. No, never to me. He always made an exception with me. He's been mentally disturbed, and I don't think for a minute he's been cured. - You said just now... - I don't care what I said. It's what I've seen. To me, Jo seems a very nice... A very nice what? That's what I want to know. Young person. Don't try the staffroom prevarication on me. To me, she appears a very pleasant young girl. Didn't she... Doesn't she... Surely you're not denying that Miss Delaney is a trifle, Oh, the merest soupçon, unfeminine? George Mason, look me in the eye when I'm shouting at you. Lettice, I've had a bitter day, and I need... piano this weekend. Piano! Do you hear me? If anybody bitches, or raises their voice, or bares his or her breast, or tears their hair, or anybody else's, I... I walk straight out of this house, and... spend the night with my brother. I want peace. I need peace in this house. I like Jo a great deal. I think she's a good person, and she is good to Laurie. My God, I hope not. And that is all I am prepared to say. - Now, let me say... - Don't interrupt! I like her. And you'll be doing us all a service if you will try and do the same thing. Is that understood? Laurie is our son, and he has a perfect right to live the life he wants with the girl... the young person that he wants. And the sooner that you accept that, the better. I shall never forgive you. That's sanctimonious, two-faced, gutless escapism. My God, the Havendons! Tell her I'm ill. Tell her I'm ditzy. We're all dead. You know how she loves scandal. But now that she's here, why not... Get the door before Laurie or worse opens the door. It's stuck again. Is that Laurie on the stairs? He'll let them in. - Well, why not? - Ssh! They'll hear you. Do you think they're having trouble with Laurie? I'm having trouble with my circulation. Tell her we have some curious infection. That at least is true. Perhaps he's turned violent. We have some curious infection! - George! - It's freezing! Ssh! Go away! Do you think we ought to hang about? That was the worst moment of my life. They'll never speak to me again. She will, if it's only to speak my epitaph. It... It was the Havendons, wasn't it? Yes. We shouldn't have come. Would she ever like me, do you think? Well, there's a million to one chance that she could open her arms and say "Laurie, I love Jo." If she had, I would have choked. Well, thank God I warned you. Your father's all right. I like him. Well, the bits of him that she's left. George, is it going to blow up? Yes, my dear. I rather think it is. Happily, I'm ready to die. My God, they've come back! Now, leave this to me. And now for the weather forecast. Sleet and snow are likely to spread south by the late evening, reaching the homosexual counties by dawn... Actually, it was Liz, but, er... it seemed to work. Oh, er... she dropped some flowers on the path. - Do you want them? - Lord, no! It looks like Kew Gardens already. You know, I'm quite enjoying this. Well, that's good news. I hope the soup is spiced enough for you, Miss Delaney. I'm afraid tinned tomato isn't very exotic. But it's been Laurie's favourite since he was five. It's unbelievable. I never tasted anything like it. Red pepper. Yes, it's always been tomato. And we're having roast chicken, of course. Yes, it was always roast chicken for birthdays. I'll have a bet with you it'll be jelly to follow. It's custard. But with fruit salad. Mmm, now I know I'm home. - Was it a good journey? - Oh, marvellous. - Awful. - Oh, come on, it wasn't that bad. We got talking to this young man. Well, he was young, anyway. Yes, I thought he was a young man, too. Suddenly, he said, "I'm going to have a baby." We'd just left the station. The awful thing was, we congratulated him. We thought he'd meant his wife, the long-haired girl next to him. Oh, yes, we thought that she was his wife. The next minute, he was on the floor in labour. How appalling. A man? - English? - Oh, yes. Which class were you travelling? Well, it wasn't really a man. I mean, he was just dressed like one. But the girl, you see, that we thought was the wife, turned out to be the husband dressed in a sort of, um... er... you know, with beads and things, and... Well, he held her hand, and told her... told her stories of unlikely births, while Jo delivered the baby. Jo was marvellous. I've always seen your books as a kind of escape, Mrs Mason. I've always seen them as a higher standard of living. I reread some while I was in hospital. The psychiatrist couldn't believe that they were written by a happily married woman. Miss Delaney, how long have you been an air steward? ...ess. I'm longing to introduce Jo to everyone I went to school with. I think Arthur's going to be knocked out by her. Oh, Arthur's much too languid for anything so strenuous. Really? I handle that type rather well. I'm sure. - George? - Yeah, I'm going to get some cold water. I think that's what I need. Laurie, how long have you known Miss Delaney? Er, three weeks. Is that including weekends? Yes, and feast days, and bank holidays, and quarter days, the lot. Three weeks. - The best time of my life. - Darling! There's not a drop of cold water anywhere in the house. George, I wish you'd stop torturing me with these newsflashes. Before you carve seconds, I think you'd better say your few words. Oh, I do wish you'd stop telling me that. Is that few enough, Mother? I have nothing to say beyond, "Welcome home to both of you." That really is nice, Mr Mason. Thank you. I needed to hear that from someone. Miss Delaney, you wear your hair quite short for flying. This? Oh, it's only a midi-Afro. Don't you like it? I think it's stunning. Jo, Miss Delaney, is rather an odd name for a gir... for a young person of your sex. I think I'd better water the plants again. I have to do it every few minutes to keep them upright. You wear uniquely masculine clothes, Miss Delaney. Oh, these? We're giving them to Oxfam next week. But it's fun in the dark. Everyone mistakes me for Laurie. But that's where it's at these days, so maybe I shouldn't worry. Just enjoy being a man. Where did you two meet? - In a cinema queue. - Not very romantic. George, perhaps now you'll say what you've been wanting to say. Was it a very big queue? Miss Delaney, when did you last wear a skirt? Tell us what's on your mind, George. The lavatories were covered in graffiti again today. If the walls were anything to judge by, the entire intellectual effort of the school goes into masturbation. Don't try to sidetrack the issue by being vulgar. Mother, are you and Father all right? I mean, you've hardly spoken a sane word since we arrived here. Fair average. - George! - Are you... Look, if you're going to ask me any more information about the sizes of cinema queues, I may get a second opinion on the pair of you. Oh, listen, you don't usually work this late. Do you still love me? Darling, how many more times do I have to tell you? I'm committed. Have you slept? Oh, I couldn't get near the bed for the warm glow from the springs. I tried lying on the floor. Even the bloody dust is scorching. Hey, what's so funny? Well, it's snowing outside, it's a foot deep already, and here we are like a fish fry. - Hey, move over. - Oh, no. - Come on. - It's hot. It's hot enough. "Hey... 'Hmm? Oh, we shouldn't have come, you know. Oh, don't apologise. Do you think I could make it? Here, in this house? Well, you're not doing badly, and the conditions aren't ideal. I thought she would at least have been polite. Uptight, yeah, you know, but polite. At her age, the curlier the hair, the curlier the lip. Now, I can get mine straightened out at the barber's... with a struggle. Let's make love. Now he asks me. Please? No. That is, "I'm sorry, no." Why not? Well, it's like having it off in the British Museum. I do some of my best work in the British Museum. - Whose bed? - Well, here, of course. I thought we were going to do this for pleasure. Well, there are other places. The wardrobe? The drawers? Look, there'll be other nights. Not tonight, there won't. Your room's boiling. That only leaves George's bed and the garage. Well, it's ridiculous! Come on. Come with me. Where are we going? Ssh! What the hell are you doing? - Monitoring. - Oh, leave them alone. At this time of night, it's unthinkable. - Get back to bed. - But they'll be gone tomorrow. And it's not for me to speak ill behind anyone's back when I can be saying it to their face. What are you suggesting? Definitely not a cup of Horlick's. It will be like air conditioning here. Do you mean it? Here, on the floor. Let's stop discussing it and get on with it. - Darling? - What? Nothing. Kiss me. Mmm. What's wrong? Cramp! It's a cramp. Cramp. Er... how are you doing? I thought I was doing my best. I didn't lay the bloody floor. - You're not going to lay me either. - Yet. Would the top of the dining table be any easier for you? You're beginning to sound like my mother. Well, that that might excite you. That's a bloody personal remark to make! You're not putting this onto me. I told you I liked the idea. How the hell could I waft hot and cold in this bloody temperature? Look what we have here. Look, I'm going to make love whether you want me or not. Whether you can or not. - You bitch. - I didn't mean that. I didn't. I know exactly what you meant. Look, I can't make love and apologise at the same time. We never had this difficulty in London. Not even with the landlady on the stairs. Undress me. - What? - Undress me. Well, don't you think it's rather cold? Coming, as I do, from a hot country? It's no good here. Oh, look... We've got to a stage now, we toss a coin, "Do we or don't we?" - Do we? - Well, don't we?! No, not so loud. Look, I can't put a notice on the door. Coitus don't-interruptus. I'm not interrupting anything, I hope? Can't I even kiss Jo without you breaking in on us? If you're hot, why don't you stand in front of the refrigerator, darling? I poured myself a glass of water in the bathroom, and it cracked the glass. I came down to see if we had a plastic cup. I'm a little embarrassed to find we have. Did we disturb you, Mrs Mason? When you are my age, you will learn to take all natural and unnatural... catastrophe in your ample stride. Laurie, you're wearing the same pyjamas as your friend. Well, think yourself lucky we're not both dressed like you. I do most profoundly. Not that I consider decency to be a question of luck. It's something you commit yourself to at a very early age. Or not. What a pretty nightdress, Mrs Mason. It's pretty appropriate, yes. Or should I call it a négligée? If you don't know by now, there's little point in my telling you. One of the stairs creaks. She must've been stalking us. But what if she'd come down five minutes later? - Oh, for God's sake, don't. - I would have died on the spot. So would she, and I expect I would have followed. With three dead bodies littering the floor, that only leaves Dad to die of shock and grief. Well, I'm going to bed. I simply can't face her. Do you both plan to spend the entire night down here, one way or another? Mother, we're not planning anything. Even if we're not happy, can't we all smile at the same time? What is the time? I haven't the slightest idea. The heat seems to have stopped the church clock, and that's a quarter of a mile away. I wondered where you'd all go to. What a waste of intelligence. How far could anyone go in this heat? I had to stop twice just coming downstairs. For a breath, or to hear better? I never listen to other people's conversations, except when it's my duty to overhear. True, true. So you can't sleep either, Mr Mason? There is some difference between my husband's waking and sleeping state. Sorry, if you just tell me what the right thing to say is. Oh, take no notice of me until I absolutely insist. Those pyjamas suit you perfectly. How well they fit. What the devil is the time, anyway? Oh, I think it's somewhere between three and four. Oh, it sounds worse when you put it into words. Can I borrow one of your sleeping pills, dear? How does one repay a sleeping pill? Oh, help yourself. Take them all. Oh, let's get back to bed. After you, Miss Delaney. How much more of term is left, Mr Mason? A week. You'll last that long. You'll look good for years yet. Have you any idea, Jo, how many, many, many days there are in one school week? You're always setting us some sort of problem, George. Why don't you set us an example? So much more useful. I know, why don't we all go for a walk in the snow? Well, at least freezing out there must be better than frying in here. I'll come. I love the snow. Such enthusiasm. You come, Mr Mason. It'll be good fun. Besides, it's dangerous to lose too much salt. - Come and cool down. - No, the colonial spirit left me years ago. You go, Lettice. Don't be ridiculous. The shock'd kill me. What do you think I am? A Finn? Are you serious? I never know with you, Laurie. I think it's a mad idea. I know, but it looks so beautifully cold. Oh, it's stuck. That's a relief. I know, I'll meet you on the landing under the loft. We can get through the attic window, and then slide down the roof. So put on your thickest trousers and two sweaters. Don't wait for us. See you! Catch their death. - George? - Mmm. If you feel as terrible as you look, don't go to bed. You'll never get up. No, wait, darling. You didn't... You obviously didn't notice they were wearing the same pyjamas. At the same time? How extraordinary. It's when I'm talking to myself that I'm grateful for the glimmer of intelligence the conversation shows. No, wait. I'm deeply sorry to have to tell you this, but... she has hairy wrists. - Who? - Jo Delaney. You were probably looking at Laurie. If I have to notice everything in this house for one more minute, I shall expect dispensation from the church. From all the churches. Lettice, it is some time on a hot winter's morning. My eyes are full of sand, every now and then you seem to open your mouth and say something, which may or may not make sense. If you are driving at anything that I ought to say, or do, or feel, at least wait until I have faculties enough to understand you. What are we going to do with these? Come on, darling. Come on, trust me. Now watch the steps. They've gone. They were serious. Unfortunately, they'll be back. But I shall be in a sleep so sweet that... even the angels will bend the knee. You're quite clear what has to be done tomorrow? Today. I am not, and I don't want to be. I've reached my journey's end. Please give me some indication that you know what I'm talking about. You must tell him about his friend. Tell him what? Tell him that she's not what he or she or any of us would love to think she was. No. Sleep on it. See if she still looks the same tomorrow. George, I've just had the most awful thought. What if someone in the village sees her... him... them... it? Three o'clock in the morning? Don't be absurd. I will be beside you. You don't have to make the point all at once. But you do have to make it once and for all. - Is that clear? - Mmm. Mm-mm-mmm. George, if you were half the man Jo is, we wouldn't have this problem! George! Down! Down, boy! Oh. What, what? Sleeping on the job? Wait till Mother hears about this. Only forty winks. Not as many as that, actually. Didn't you get any sleep last night? Oh, I think the sleeping pill's only just beginning to work now. Oh, I can't keep my eyes open. Not that I want to. You do look a bit rough round the eyes. Mmm. Laurie, has your mother been saying anything to you? Anything that you might feel unable or... disinclined to discuss, you know? Dad, are you in any kind of trouble? - Because I do wish you'd say... - No, no, no, no, of course not. I thought you might have developed a taste for boys, or something. No, only really exceptional teachers manage that. The gear suits you, Mr Mason. Gear... on! Yes, a little preposterous for mid-December, don't you think? I last wore these in Positano. George, that particular plant only blooms once in a lifetime. I think we've rather forced the choice of today upon it, but did you have to kill it so young? - I'll go. - No, stay where you are. Go where, dear? Wasn't that the front doorbell? I didn't hear anything. I hope you haven't been overworking your poor brain again. You didn't hear anything, did you, George? I don't remember. I'm sure it was the doorbell. There. Sit down. I wish you'd remember you're on holiday. It was only the bell on the cooker. Turn down the meat, will you, dear? - Can't we have a cold lunch? - Well, I don't see how. Mother, it is the front doorbell. You know, I do believe you're right. Isn't that the most amazing thing? The heat is bending the sound waves. You go, dear. No, it might be... I mean, what if it's the... I went last night. I'm sure it's only the milkman. At this time of day? He's very, very, very late. Well, I'm sure he's welcome whenever he calls. - Shall I go? - I'll get rid of her, er... him. I'll get you an extra pint, dear. Dad, what's the matter with her? She seems perfectly normal to me. If she goes on like this, the only thing that'll keep her out of a psychiatrist's hands is sudden death. That remark defies analysis. Is there a logical explanation for all this? - Ah, well... - No, I thought not. Thank you. Ah! Has she, er... he gone? - Completely. - Was it the milkman? In a way. But I thought I heard a woman's voice. Mine, dear. I've never cut our milkman. I mean, as well as yours. Oh, er... you know how uncertain of themselves some milkmen are. Mother, if you've taken to to apologising for me, even to the Milk Marketing Board... My God. Darling, when have you ever heard me apologise to anyone? Mmm, before I forget, I'm asking Arthur Potter round for lunch. Nyah-ah-ah! More guests! Oh, sweetheart, be reasonable. There's hardly enough oxygen to go around. I don't mean to be frightful, but the temperature's still rising. All right, all right. For drinks, then. How about hot Vermouth? Look at us. None of us is at their loveliest in this heat, and I think Jo has to be seen at her best. Any little improvement helps her. Any of us. Oops! Good Lord, there's a crack over there. - Where? - There. I can't see anything. Oh, it's only a small crack. But I'd better tackle it right away. I'll get my crackle, er, tackle. Am I calling Arthur, or not? Darling, I don't mean to be selfish, but I can't have that person in my house. Mother, he is not that person. I thought you liked him. Well, wouldn't it be a trifle hurtful for him? Why should it be? Why should it be hurtful? Well, he was very... Oh, he embarrasses me. Why? Well, he's so arch. Mother, he happens to be my best friend. But his clothes. Oh, for God's sake. What's wrong with his clothes? Well, during the time you were inseparable, they were quite extraordinary. Do you mean "way out"? They were extraordinarily bright. They hurt my eyes. I go for bright clothes. They were masculine. I... I mean, er... unmasculine. I adore gorgeous men. The taller the better. You can spare me the enthusiasm. It must be difficult for a... a person of your generation to sympathise, Mrs Mason. My darling child, I suspect you know very little about women of my generation, and our difficulties. When it comes to sex, you can't discuss terms with people. I never discuss terms with anyone. You never discuss sex with anyone. Can't find me tackle. Sex isn't what you wear. It's not being face up or face down in bed. Nowadays, it's simply a matter of personality. Mr Mason, you must see it all the time in school. Sex? It's not part of the curriculum. Look, who gives a hell whether it's a girl or a boy? We're all a bit of both, aren't we, Mrs Mason? I bet you don't get many absolute heteros in your school. They're mainly West Indian. Sometimes, it's only when they get their insurance cards that you do discover what sex they are. Doesn't it shock you that the sexes are coming closer together? Young people will go on experimenting, my dear, whether my eyebrows go up or down. In my day, the excitement was in guessing which man would ask you to dance, not in guessing which were the men. Nowadays, I guess it's very chic to boast that some of one's best men friends are women. I find it extremely decadent. Let me remind you, it was my generation that produced Jacqueline Kennedy, Terence Rattigan, and Agatha Christie. I'm sorry if I said anything to upset you, Mrs Mason. Words! When have I ever been afraid of words? I'm sure that everything you've said is right. It's just me that doesn't think so. Jo, get your coat. We'll take Arthur to the pub. I'm sure Mother will excuse us. Darling boy, I hope you'll always do exactly what you think is right, after first having talked it over with me. Listen, I must get my face together. No, leave it. It's perfect. Isn't it, Mother? Miss Delaney's looks are her problem, not mine. George, we'll get the lunch. - Lunch? - May I help? Thank you. The kitchen's so small... We're going to meet Arthur. Now, do you want us back here for lunch or not? Just as you wish, dear, although it's six months since we've glimpsed you. Then we'll be back here at one o'clock. All right? Bye. - She seems... - Well? She has plenty of ideas. You might as well say a shopping list has ideas. If that's an example of what your schools are turning out, I'd like to see you in another job. Well, you can't expect everyone to agree with us. Least of all when they're half our age. My age. Why not? It's a democracy. They ought to toe the line. Shall I make the beds? When did you ever make the beds? Mmm? They've been done for at least an hour. - Oh, well, I thought it might just... - These plants are taking over. I think it's going to be either them or us. How keen do you think he is? I don't think he knows what he's saying or doing. Well, you've got to remember that we're 2,000 miles further south this weekend. It must seem just like home to Miss Delaney. Oh... Why don't you call her Jo? I hate the name. It's... so short. Don't you think it odd that when you couldn't keep a dry stitch on your back, she had nothing to wash? Or is that peculiar to hot countries? What do you make of that? At the risk of failing you completely, I make nothing of it. Don't be so coy. I don't think she wears any female clothing at all, and for excellent reasons. Lettice, this is a conversation best left to another time. George, this is the worst thing I've ever had to say about a coloured lady, but I think she may not be a female. Lettice, I've never heard you so uncharitable. - What did you do with the butter? - Oh, bugger the butter. Laurie says she's a woman, she says she's a woman. With such evidence, I am prepared to take her femininity on trust. Laurie's still sick. The only thing he's sick with is love. Well, all the more reason to find out what she is before it gets out of hand. Do something! What, debag her? Telephone her parents. What on earth for? We don't know them. Well, they must know if they have a daughter or not. It's not just something a mother feels. No, no, never. I won't do it. It's obscene. Come away from that telephone. He is your only son. Listen, they're only just across the road. How do you ask someone if their daughter is a girl? Hmm? And a complete stranger at that. We don't know where the parents live. There's a label on her luggage. My God, how does your brain work? Quite efficiently. 13A Belgrave Square, SW1. You'll get the number from Enquiries. No. I won't. I'd choke. Do you want your son to end up a... I'm not sure that I know the word. Yes, if it's going to bring a little peace into this house. George, you are impossible. The Delaneys will be too busy with state affairs, You know, passports, legal immigration, that sort of thing. Sooner or later, you have to take somebody at their word. And I think she's a girl. There. She's flatter-chested than you. Well, won't make any difference. We neither of us want to be Miss World. At least get the number from Enquiries. Now, it doesn't hurt to telephone Enquiries, does it? What moral right have we got to be doing this? It's not a sin to call the operator. Lettice, if Laurie has any passionate feelings at all, he'll know the form by now. My son is a virgin. What does one dial for Enquiries? At least if I'm wrong, we get to know the parents sooner. I'm sure anyone living in Belgravia is prepared to give a straight answer. I'll spend the rest of my life regretting this. Oh, hello. Er... It's the operator. I... Oh, good morning. - What's it like your end? Nice? - Stop waffling, George. I want a number. Oh, a little West End number. No, a telephone number. Name? Mason. Not our name! Delaney. He wants Delaney. I can't do it. It goes against everything I believe. Pacifist! No, no, not you, Operator. Thank you. Delaney. No, I don't know the initial. We're not that close. Delaney, 13A... Belgrave Square, SW1. And please be quick, because they could be back any minute. I would never have thought anyone mentioned in dispatches could be such a coward. - Oh, my God. - Hmm? Get... Get me a pencil with a point. There's one in the hall. On... On the table. Op... Operator! Oh, that was very quick. On the table! I'm afraid you'll have to hang on a minute. The pencil with the point is... is in the hall, on the table. Really? 0-1-2-3-5-double 9-8-3. Surely you can hang on for a minute? It's what you're paid for. - Nothing here! - Well, then, on the desk. No, stop misunderstanding me, you silly man. Damn it! 0-1-2... 2... 2-3-5-double 9-8-3. 2-3-5-double 9-8-3. At least try that. Someone in Belgravia might know what sex she is. No, I... I think this would come better from you, love. Be a man. I... no, I... Very well, George Mason. Where are you going? I don't trust that "inspired" look. I'm going to search her luggage to find out what her underclothing is like. You can't rifle a guest's belongings! You always underestimated me. All right, all right, all right. I'm dialling. But let it be understood that you don't touch a thing of hers. Oh, my God, it's ringing. Well, don't watch me. Can't you go and find anything to do? Oh, hello. Mr Delaney? Yes, it is. It's the right number. - Why did you ring off? - Well, it's such a shock. He's a High Commissioner. He's one of our coloured brothers. You'd be hopeless in a nuclear war. You'd sit and watch the Russians rape me, and then make us all a nice cup of tea with sugar in it. - Ah, would you like a cup? - No. Oh, Mr Delaney, that is you? Yes, it is. That was my husband who telephoned a few minutes ago. I'm so sorry you were cut off. Can you spare a moment? He'd like to talk to you. Ask him. Take it! Darling, we have the right to know what's going on under our own rooves on account of the mortgage repayments alone. S-s-say something. I think he's gone. - Hello? - No! Oh, Mr Delaney, um... can I help you? Tell him who you are first. I don't know anymore. Do you, by any chance, live at 13A Belgrave Square, London SW1? - Yes, I do. - Oh, you do? He does. It's me again. Mr and Mrs Mason calling, Mr and Mrs Lettice Mason. I see you probably don't know... What? You do know? I'm not that widely read in the West Indies. Well, that makes it much more friendly. I told you it'd be all right. Now, ring off. I thought perhaps you might not have heard of us from Jo. There, ask him. Mr Delaney, um... is your wife there? Yes, hold on. No, no, no. I don't much want to talk to her. I just hoped that she might be out shopping. Oh, she's just going? Oh, well, I don't want to keep you. I know what it's like on Saturdays. Goodbye. Ask if he has a daughter. Get away! She'll hear you! How is Jo? Staying with us, as a matter of fact. Say "she", and see what he says to that. Jo's very well. We're very pleased to have met Jo. She! Her! I mean... Ooh, you are impossible. No, sir, my wife. You know how women hover. No, no, no, don't put Mrs Delaney on. No, not if she's waiting to go out shopping. But all you have to say is, "Jo is a very nice girl." I thought anyone could have said that. Mrs Delaney, is it snowing this morning? Oh? That's very rough on you, but I daresay you're getting acclimatised. Yes. Yes, we like Jo very much indeed. And it's probably going to snow here, too. Ask her! I'm tearing my hair out! Mrs Delaney, just before you go out into the cold, do you... have... Do you know if you have a daughter? It's him. It's him again, now. Your wife sounded really nice. No, no, old chap, no. Don't worry about the expense. This sort of thing doesn't happen every day. Yes. Yes. We like the young people, yes. Very much. And... And we want you to know, from the bottom of our hearts, that we like your... daughter... immensely. - W hat? - W hat? He's looking forward, very much, to meeting our daughter, Laurie. George... George! George! Come here! Lettice, I do not approve. - A guest is a guest. - Is a guest. Open this case. There are certain feminine traits in every man. I have beautiful feet, but that doesn't give every perfect stranger a right to rifle my belongings. Well, if this happened in school, you wouldn't keep quiet. Schools aren't the places to keep quiet, but I'd rather hoped my home was. Lettice, there are certain things that can't be said between gentlemen, and telling Laurie that he's... mistaken about the sex of his girlfriend is one of them. Open the case. You... You can't be content to have your career ruined by letting him continue in a relationship that is as godless as it is fashionable. Jo is, I believe, a young woman. Charming, attractive, of advanced ideas, which, I fancy, for better or worse, she puts into effect. If she's your criterion of womanhood, by God, I've failed you. Laurie's gone barking mad. I mean, he's... He's lost touch with reality. The case! My dear, if you respect me as a man... Open the case. If you won't, I will. - You can't! - Can't I? Oh... - Read that. - Mmm? All of it? It's a Bible. "To Joseph, my beloved son." In black and white. Wait till he gets home. Lettice, I'm a... a liberal coward, but everyone has a right to live his own life, make his own decisions. It's a right that I will defend for my son, even against my wife. You... You can't live his life for him. I don't want to. I'm far too busy. If he is nightly in the arms of a young man, which, pray God, he isn't, does it matter? You'd have to resign from the golf club, for a start. Lettice, he's out of the nursery. He's a man. Whatever my son's taste in sex, I'm not ashamed of him. If Jo is a man... I don't think I'm disgusted. If they have a... a taste for one another, it adds to their life, then... as far as I'm concerned, they can be as loving as they like. We're none of us so normal, so self-dependent, that we can turn down all the good sex that comes our way, or the chance of having someone to love us. Don't you agree? I don't give a damn if she's a man. If she is, she's a jolly good chap. Going to lunch? At the nearest hotel that will have me. But you're not leaving me now. You can't possibly leave me now. Say I'll be back when they've gone. - Pretend we're making the bed. - But it's made. Well, then, unmake it. - Just making the bed. - Again. Dad, what on earth are you doing? You never made a bed in your life. Yeah, well, I... Your father is fighting for decency and sanity. What future is there in that? Your father would like a quiet word with you. - Oh. - But if you're busy, it'll keep till after lunch. Jo, be an angel, will you, and get me my spectacles? They're by the telephone. I can see them quite clearly. But you're wearing them. Oh! How quick. I can hardly see a thing because of the steam. Could you get me my case? They're next door, in my bedroom. That's it, isn't it? I mean, look, it's got your name on it. See? Shall I bring you your bag? You can put the whole lot in. Now, I think that is downstairs. Thank you. Or shall I do some washing? It'll take about half an hour or so. Or perhaps I could take longer? Jo, I want you with me. Oh, no, no. Listen, I don't want to get involved with all this now. - Please. - Anything that I've got to say can be said in front of Jo. Er... now... Sex is a... a very wonderful thing. Um... What did you say? I'm sorry. That's awful of me. Do you know that is the second time that word has been used in this house? Your father said that sex was wonderful. Well, I... in its way, it is wonderful. Not always necessary, but always wonderful. Sex? Mr Mason, why now? Well, you must just take my word for it. Wonderful and... and mysterious. I don't think it's in anyone's interest to stress "mysterious". You mean one doesn't know where to find it, or how to get enough? If you're going to be flippant, I'll... insist on turning the whole thing over to your mother. Dad, is this what is called "a man-to-man talk"? - Almost entirely. - No, no, no, no. It's not a talk, Laurie. It's just a... chat Mr Mason, is this something to do with me? Oh, no, please don't be embarrassed. I've heard it all before. No, no, no. You... You couldn't be farther from the point. No, to be strictly accurate... George means it does concern you, my dear. Actually, we love you very much, but we don't want to see you hurt. Not on your first visit. - I see. - Well, I don't. But with "sex" and "mystery" so far established, my interest is held. Well, it's something that your mother thinks that I think you... you ought to know, and she thinks now is the time that you ought to know it now. Er... Mother, how have you got him going? He never talked so lucidly in his life. Your father says what he feels. Must you, Mr Mason? I think I've said all I need to say on... Don't be preposterous! I haven't understood a word. I want this ended before lunch. Your father, if I can guess what he wants to say, means that sex is only marvellous with the right people. I realise this is a very big idea, darling, but will you promise me to think about it? I think of nothing else, Mother. Who are the right people, Mrs Mason? Do you have a list? It's... It's a question of what's, er... appropriate. To finding the piece that fits. You don't have to take our word for it. God has expressed himself on the subject in no uncertain terms. Now, where was I? Having sex with the right people. You know, I used to wonder how you spent your lunch hour. If you think for one minute I'm going to marry some rich Pre-Raphaelite, like Liz, than you can forget it. Liz would have died for him. - You didn't tell me about her. - There's nothing to tell. She's a very nice girl, but because she's unusually plain, she'll probably stay one. Your father wishes me to say that he's troubled by certain things that you don't seem to be aware of. Then if he could just draw, mime, suggest, act any of them, we could all have lunch. When it comes to a question of the utmost tact, your father is inhibited. Fortunately, being an artist and not an academic, I'm spared these scruples. Your father wishes me to make it clear, as all my books made clear, that life is best with a person of... the opposite sex. - Who? - Opposite sex. Is this what you wanted to tell me? More or less to the word, yes. Well, there's at least six couples in my block of flats that don't agree. Oh, for Christ's sake, why tell me this? Is it some kind of confession? Have you been feeling up the first year behind the gym? My boy, the best, the fullest relationship is that in which one discovers not a reflection of oneself, but the soul, the psychology to complement one's own. Thank you, dear. No-one denies that other... varieties of sex are exciting, or distracting, but... But... But the only relationship which... which... which yields the... the real, the fullest lasting pleasure, is the... what we call the homosexual relationship. What?! Ah, heterosexual. Er... We can pause for a moment for you to grasp the implications of that. Only a moment, please, because I'd love to get into something dry for lunch. We want to know what you mean to do about it. What can I do about what? We feel as if you need help, or... That's where we come in. Mother, one of us needs help. May I point out that it is not me. Frankly, no. I am in love. We're in love, Mrs Mason. The quality of the emotion doesn't make it any less unusual. Mrs Mason, I'll make one thing clear now. I did not come hereto be patronised by you. Then how do you explain this? What's that doing here? Is that all you have to say? Well, what interest is my brother's Bible to you? Brother! Thank God for that! I packed the damned thing by mistake. I thought it was War and Peace. - Your father wishes to say... - Mother, I am thirty years of age, and you're acting as if I'm still not off the tit! I love her! I'll go. I don't have tits! And age has nothing to do with being able to look someone in the face and tell their sex. You don't seem to have grasped, even at your age, what most people can tell by the time they're three months. - Jo is not... - Who the hell is Fred Delaney? Oh, my God, it's Fred Delaney. Jo, it's for you. - Daddy? - He sounds furious. I mean, why is he phoning here? - He's screaming something at you. - Well, shall I? I mean, I hadn't told him I was going to be here this weekend. Well, that shows a remarkable lack of... - How did he find out? - I don't know. Take it. Hello, Daddy? It's not really you? - Are you all right? - Yes. Good Lord, yes. I'm fine. I'm perfectly all right. Why shouldn't I be? I'm too old for this. If Laurie finds out... - Look, I can't hear you. - Come home. At once. I can't. I'm with Laurie and the parents. They're very nice people. Mr Mason's particularly nice. Ask them why they telephoned us. Did you telephone my parents? - Not an intentional... - Of course we didn't. - Oh, we didn't. Did we? - Now you know damn well we did. - Let's get one thing straight. - Oh! Oh, yes. It's coming back to me. The Dela... Oh, those Delaneys! Yes, I think we did. - Why? Did they say we did? - Yes. What the hell did you call them for? Ask them what's happening. Well, they seem to say "yes". Yes, they did. - Why did you phone them? - Laurie, be quiet! Would you just keep from meddling in my affairs? Are they mad? Mummy, you too? What a full house. Yes, I am perfectly all right. Oh, it's so hot here. It's a hundred in the shade. If you're a prisoner, I'm calling the police. No, no, no, no. Don't call the police. I knew we hadn't impressed them. Well, the call didn't go quite as we planned. I don't know what she thinks is happening to me. Mother, we're practically under arrest. Is that girl, Laurie, a boy? Yes, Laurie is a boy. Good God, not that it's any of your business. But Laurie is a girl's name. Jo, when are you going to settle down? I don't know when I'm going to settle down. When you die and leave me some money. Now will you drop that "more married than thou" act and get off the line! No, I don't love you! Or Mummy! Oh, they seem to think I'm in some kind of asylum. Not some kind, the worst. You will be grateful to me, Laurie, when you hear what Daddy has to say. Oh, no, not even you can't believe that! I have nothing more to say. Mother, dear, doesn't it ever occur to you that I might know everything that she is and isn't by now? I know that she's never going to beat you at Scrabble. I know that she's never going to be Home Counties Badminton Champion, or President of your Needlewomen's Guild, or good at church flower decoration. We can discuss her very serious personality disorders later. I'm going upstairs. Nobody moves until I've finished. I have spared myself the luxury of speaking my mind for three decades, and now I am marvellously prepared. Jo is not, I believe, although I will be happy to be found wrong... Good enough? Isn't that what you were going to say? How does a person become that? We care for each other. We show others we care. Isn't that how it's done? I want his happiness as much as you. Doesn't it mean anything to you that we're in love? Love! Love. Oh, Laurie. Mother, Jo and I are engaged. What did you say? Engaged in what? Er... Engaged in being married. Jo and I are married. Yes. Yes! Did you hear what we said? - We're married. - Engaged and married? Yes, in that order. Good Lord. Thank God. In what sense? On what possible level? - By which law? - Was this in church? Oh, yes. It was a lovely idea. We couldn't resist. Which church? - Er, Saint... - St Mark's, NW6. And when did this happy event... - Oh, why, yesterday. - The day before yesterday, yes. Well, as there seems to be some confusion about the dates, I suppose you claim to be married to each other, you... Thursday, darling. You remember, we were on the train yesterday? Oh, yes! Heavens, we're an old married couple. Hasn't time flown? Is there a marriage certificate? I'm not asking to see it, of course. How can you possibly be married? I should have known it. I knew it at once when I saw you. I knew you were in love. There was this... - glow. - That was the central heating. - Congratulations! - Thank you. This is better news than you know. I feel ten years younger. Good Lord! Look! The thermometer! The temperature's falling. The oil! There's no more oil to feed the monster. Lettice, we've survived! Ah, I can breathe again! We've come through. We ought to be celebrating. Ah, now for the supreme test. Look! There! Alone, I did it!
