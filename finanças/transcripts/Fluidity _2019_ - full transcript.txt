[Jill] So how did we get here to this synthetic world, [Jill] the kind of friendships, the disposable relationships, [Jill] the new world order where we can fuck in real life, [Jill] but we can't be friends on Facebook. We're single-cell organisms that evolve, start walking, grow brains, find fire, make tools, and survive. Now during all of this, we fucked for reproduction. Fast-forward to the Bible, sacred marriage, love becomes a thing. We procreate for the sake of legacy. Skip over years of war and travesty to courtship in the 18th century. Think Pride and Prejudice type shit. Then we have two big wars. Men come home and bang their horny ladies, and thus the Baby Boomers are born. Boys and girls start going steady. My grandparents become sweethearts, get together and start a family. Back then, people were happy. People were boring. Then the Sixties arrive. We get the pill, drugs, the all-encompassing music scene. The Feminist movement unfurls, and sex before marriage becomes all the rage. The Internet boom happens. Online dating sites begin. My parents meet and settle down, but only after they have fun with other people, and suddenly, we are born. We get AIM, Myspace, and Facebook. The entire social experience moves online. We get dating apps and a world filled with people hiding behind the masks of social networks. And finally, we arrive at today, a social world stripped down to its core until there's nothing left but a veneer of sexual equality and freedom. We take the morning-after pill like it's a fucking vitamin. No effort, no commitment. Just swipe, fuck, and swipe again, a generation of stimulation consuming everything around us with no thought of what we leave behind. [steam hisses] Next customer?

It's totally normal. Do you sell to guys, too? [person] So before I came out as nonbinary, I was always really confused about gender. Like, I'd call myself a boy, which didn't go over well with my parents or teachers or anyone, actually. When I got to high school, I kind of learned how to be a girl. You know, all the feminine trappings. I had sex for the first time. It was with a boy. It was strange, though, because part of me was wondering what it was like for him the whole time. Then after high school, I kind of learned what it meant to be gender fluid. Could you be more specific? Yeah, so, instead of she and her, my pronouns are they, them, and theirs, and I'm open to dating any gender, but I don't know. I still meet these women who understand the queer part but not the nonbinary thing. And some people still don't really believe that it's a real thing. [Lilly] We reshape, rewrite, recreate ourselves, [Lilly] changing constantly over time [Lilly] with each new relationship. This is you. Human. There are a few things that determine this. First, your identity, [Lilly] the gender that your brain thinks you are, [Lilly] your male or femaleness dependent on your genitalia. Penis, your vagina. Again, mental, physical. And then there's your gender expression, the way society categorizes the way you dress, act, and behave based on outdated stereotypes of masculinity and femininity. Think your cross-dressers and your tomboys. All of these things determine who we are, but we're gonna focus on this. Your orientation. The way you make connections with others, have relations, [Lilly] find a mate, a paramour, a fuck buddy. [Lilly] Once upon a time, [Lilly] there was only gay and straight. [Lilly] Now we have customized labels [Lilly] to flaunt our individuality, [Lilly] "A" meaning none, "bi" meaning both, [Lilly] "hetero" meaning opposite, [Lilly] "homo" meaning same, "pan" meaning all, [Lilly] poly meaning many. Phew, fuck Millennials. They should have called us the Skittles Generation, taste the rainbow. Oh, this one. This one is great. This is my favorite one. Oh, no. I'm not gonna wear it. No, no, no. It's not for you to wear. So it looks like a regular pair of underwear, right? But this little vibrator goes right inside here, and you sync it to an app on your phone. So you and your partner can be, like, on a date, and you can control it from your phone. How much do these toys go for? Um, this one is like $50, but they can range to $150 depending on the model. Wow. Are you sure you want to close down shop? Yeah. I'm very sure. But, um, if you're interested, I'm having a "going out of business" sale. -Yes. -Yeah? [both laugh] Um... That is very large.

Like, I got trophies just for showing up. And, like, my parents supported me, and then all of a sudden, it was like, "Well, now you're on your own, and by the way, here's this shitty economy that we caused, so good luck trying to feed yourself." Can we please get back to what dating and social media sites -you use to meet men? -[woman] Oh, sure. Yeah. Okay, yeah, no. I go on a lot of dates. I prefer bars to social media. Like, I know I'm a dinosaur, But, um, this one date. he asked me out for drinks, and then, like, he canceled on me because, like, I don't know. Like, maybe his dog died or whatever. And then, like, we go to the place, And later, when the check comes, he wanted me to split it. But it was just coffee so... [Lilly] Thank you. Um, that was all very helpful. Uh...Uh, okay. Hey. Will you walk out with me? [woman] Uh, sure. [chuckles] [Zuni] Here at Fashion Week, everyone is at high energy and empty stomachs. -[Zuni] Alex. -[Alex] Come on. -Zuni, just one dinner. -No. What if we just skipped dinner and go straight to sex? Alex, pass. [Alex] I don't think you know what you're missing, all right. -Surprise. -How did you get that? It's a sample. I'm just saying. All right. I'm off. See you tomorrow, beautiful. Sloane? Oh, shit. What are you doing here? This isn't exactly around the corner from you. I'm meeting a friend for a drink. Really? Let me guess. You got up before nine, right? [chuckles] To be fair, you don't exactly know me anymore. You're right. Anyway, you look great. Thank you. I feel great. And you look great, also. I love your shirt. Your hair looks good. [chuckles] Come have a seat. Well, what brings you back here? Fashion Week. I'm here for rehearsal. And how about you? -Are you still DJ'ing? -Yeah. -And how's that going? -It's going well. A lot of groupies, a lot of girl groupies. [both laugh] Would you want to go grab a drink with me? I think my friend is bailing on me anyway. What? Why would I want to have a drink with you? Why wouldn't you? You ghosted me. It's-- it's been two years. I haven't heard from you. And now you want to have a drink? What is that about? It's just two friends catching up. Is that what it is? Oh, for fuck's sake, Morgan. You really have to make it this hard? Zuni, my name is Zuni. Sorry, right, Zuni. Force of habit. We haven't been much of a habit for quite some time. Do you just want to grab one drink? Come on. So do you still live in the Village above the bodega? No, I moved to 51st, my-- Your dad's apartment. I remember. We had some pretty fun times while he was out of town. I still got that roommate, though. Giovanni. Giovanni, that crazy kid? -Yes. -You two aren't... No. No, no, no, no, no. We are just friends. Your nook at my spot is still unoccupied. Stop. You're gonna make me tear up. Nobody's like you. [both laughing] [Zuni] Oh, my god. [Sloane] You do that tongue thing every time. Help me. [laughing] Help me. [laughing] Every time! [laughing] Help me. I can't s-- I'm-- I haven't done that. -Mm. -[laughs] [exhales sharply] Come here. -[laughs] -[Sloane] Fuck. [exhales sharply] Oh, shit. [exhaling softly] [moaning] [moaning intensifies] [gasps, laughs] [both breathing heavily] Technically, this is our first time as lesbians. Is that okay with you? Is it okay that my beautiful ex-boyfriend is now... my beautiful girlfriend? My Zuni? [laughs] [Sloane] I'm sorry about how everything ended. I try to be cool, but I guess I was more shaken than I let on. I'm not proud of it. It's all right. It was a lot to deal with. It was just immature. Remember, I was cracked out on all those hormones? Yeah. You know, you were really kind of a bitch. [both laugh] All right. I got to go. What? Why? It's late. Why don't you just stay? Don't worry. I'm not gonna let this go. But I have an early call time in the morning. [exhales sharply] You still smell like you. [laughs] It's always just been me. You, me -- just two souls. You know I love you. Never stop.

This is a safe space. [sighs] I think I was just looking for excitement. [scoffs] This might be weird to say, but I almost wanted to feel some sort of pain. Not sexually, but wanting to feel something, anything. Guilt, passion. My life is... There's something wrong in my life, and I don't know what. I need to get control back over my life. There are times that I want to punish everyone around me, but... I have a child... Ben... ...and he's the one being punished. [sniffles] I'm sorry. This was a mistake. I'm 22, straight. I've experimented, but that's all it was. I don't date. My choice. I have sex occasionally. I was... having sex online for money. But I know a lot of girls that do it. I don't like social media, but I try to push myself. I'm not lonely. I would say that I'm isolated. Again, my choice. In high school, and my girlfriends would go to the mall to pick up guys.

I haven't had sex in almost a year, hashtag two hands are better than one. Not like this, though. [both laugh] I hooked up with my ex, hashtag old habits die hard. I got high for the first time in almost two years, hashtag I'm fucked. Is that true? Show me your pain, and I'll show you mine. Let's go out tonight. We-- we got to show people that we are still living the dream. [laughs] [Lilly] Finally, we arrive at today. a social world stripped down to its core until there's nothing left but a veneer of sexual equality and freedom. We've evolved three distinctively different parts of the brain for mating, reproduction, and survival: lust, romantic love, and attachment. While these brain systems can be interrelated, they can also each act independently. This means that you could have romantic love for one person, attachment for another. and lust for someone whom you're neither romantically inclined nor attached to. Today, contact can be thought a medium that doesn't require any kind of social engagement in person. To what extent does this affect our ability to have meaningful relationships, regardless of gender identification or sexual expression? A recent pole shows that 64 percent of New York City millennials are single. They just don't get past the lust stage. Is it that they're afraid of experiencing the pain that comes from ending a relationship in the romantic love or attachment phase? ♪♪♪ Or is it that there are simply too many options? ♪♪♪ Or is it that the idea of one perfect match, or soul mate, is statistically impossible? ♪ electronic music plays ♪ [indistinct conversations] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [Raul] Ready for another?
