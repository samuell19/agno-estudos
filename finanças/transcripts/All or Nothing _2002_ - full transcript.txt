Gotta be careful, the floor's wet. Do you want a hand? Did you break down? What? Did you have an accident? Nah. Some fucking monkey cunt nicked my bike, man. Fucking cunt! Fucking cunt! Fucking cunt! 'Ere, Pen... Fancy going out? When? Saturday? Um... Yeah, all right then. Oh, don't be so enthusiastic. - Oil - One-Three. - Sit down! - "Yeah?” I'm clearing Cranston Road in a minute or two. Can you just wait? Here. Are you there, One-Three? Can you pick up at 12 Bellott Street, SE10, going to Charlton? - Say again. -'12 Bellott Street, yeah?' Going to Charlton. Got it. - Mr Eyles? - Yeah, er, Elephant and Castle. Oh! Oh, Christ! I don't fucking believe it! Listen, I gotta get the car fixed. Some bitch in a Volvo smacked me up the arse. I've got no fucking lights. Ron, I told you, no swearing over the air. What's going on? - I gotta get the car off the road. - 'Why, what's the damage?' 'She's buggered my tail lights. I ain't legal!' - 'Is the car mobile?' - 'Drivable, yeah.' - Well, just come back to base. - 'I can't do that, Neville.' Come back to base and get it done tomorrow. No, I gotta do it now. Listen, Ron, don't mess me about. I'm short of drivers. Neville, fuck off! How much, then? Overnight? Hundred and fifty. That the best you can do? You want it in the morning, innit? - All right, Phil? - Hi, Ron. Got smacked up the arse. Yeah, heard it on the radio. - Are you leaving it here? - Yeah. Oh, I'll run you home.

Fucking wanker! - Just... fuck off! - Rory! - What are you playing at? - He's always doing that. You all right? - Did he hurt ya? - Nah. It's only a ball. - What are you doing? - He's a tosser. He ain't a tosser. - You're not at school now, you know. - I know. - What time do you get up this morning? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. I don't know. Probably about two o'clock, I expect. You should leave him alone, Rory, he's smaller than you. - So? He's older. - Yeah, but you're bigger. - Why are you taking his side, Mum? - I ain't taking his side. - Yes, you fucking are. - Don't swear. Yeah, it's all right, I've got me key. - Come on! - Don't shout! - What's she doing? - Well, I dunno. She's probably on the toilet or something. - Rory! - What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, you mean. - All right? - Yeah, I'm all right. What you been doing? Nothing... just reading. - How's work? - All right. - Everyone OK? - Yeah. What's for tea? Chicken and vegetable pies. - Want a biscuit? - Nah. - You all right, mate? - Yeah. Ain't got no whiplash nor nothing? She fucked off. - Did she? Do you exchange insurance details with her and that? I pulled over, right? She scarpers. That's not very nice, is it? Fucking women. Wouldn't be a world without 'em, mate. Anyway, she might have done you a favour. How do you mean? Well... if it hadn't have happened, you might have driven round the next corner and killed a little kid. It's whatsit, innit? Fickle finger of fate. If you knew what was gonna happen to you when you woke up in the morning, you'd never get out of bed. That's life. The old clock ticks. World turns round. Tide comes in, tide goes out. You're born, you die. That's it. What does your missus make at Safeway? I dunno, to tell you the truth. - What, you don't know what she earns? - Enough, yeah. Keeps the wolf from the door. With the bit I make. - All right? - Hello. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah, see you, Ron. - All right? - All right? What you got there, then? Burger buns. Three dozen.

Cor, what they got in 'em, then? I dunno. Chemicals. Picked a bloke up from the cash and carry. He was trying to get a refund on 'em. They wouldn't have it. He gave them to me as a tip. He was drunk. He bought them for a barbecue. No one turned up. - We'll have to get some burgers, then. - Yeah. All right, boy? What you been up to today, then? He's been fighting today. - What? - Fuck off, Mum! Rory, will you stop swearing at me, please. You been clumping people again? Don't listen to her, she don't know nothing about it. It's cos he ain't got nothing to do with himself. Shut up, he was asking for it! He's moping about here all day, looking for trouble. I ain't looking for trouble! I ain't done nothing! When are you gonna take him up the Job centre? Fuck sake! I'll get a job when I want - ain't got nothing to do with you! Just stop going on about it! Rory, calm down! Nobody's having a go at you. I'm just trying to help you. Fuck off! Filled the car up with petrol this morning. Thirty-eight quid. - Been busy? - Yeah. Rory, can you put your plate on the table, please? Yeah, all right! Picked up from a doctor's surgery dinner time. Old bloke. He had one of them... what's the name... frame. - Zimmer. - Yeah. Only wanted to go to the next street. I says, "Sorry, mate, I got to charge you the minimum fare, £3.50. You shouldn't have charged him nothing. No, I know. I said, "Oh, call it a couple of quid.” No, you shouldn't have called it nothing. Well, he wasn't having it. Insisted on giving me the full fare. You didn't have to take it, though, did you? No, but... it's his... what's the name, innit, his... - Dignity. - Yeah. No price on that when you're old. Ron's had a bump. - Some old woman ran into him. - Oh, is it a write-off? Nah. I said to him, "Make the most of it, mate. "Have a day off." He likes working. It's a nice evening tonight. Yeah. I ain't been for a walk for ages. Fancy going for a walk later on? No, not really. Take you out for a drink if you like. No. - Rory! - What? Well, we ain't finished yet. So? - There's pudding. - I know. - Are you in, Donna? - Yeah. - Do you want a bit of chicken pie? - No! Leave that, I'll do it later. Christ Almighty, you've had all day. Do you wanna go out later? - What? - Little drink? - No. - Why not? I had a rough day. Have you? What are you doing for tea, Dad? I don't know. - Can we get a takeaway? - No. Right. So, we'll starve then, shall we? - What's in the freezer? - Not a lot. Well, what? A sausage meal and a raspberry ripple. - Is that all? - Yeah. - There's two chicken korma in there. - No, there ain't. We had them last night. - No, we never. - Yes, we did. Yeah, me and Dad. - You never had nothing. - She never fucking does. - So, what are we doing, then? - Oh, maybe I'll get a takeaway. - When? - Later. Well, I ain't had nothing to eat since I got up. - Well, whose fault's that? - I'm starving! - You ain't done nothing since you got up. - What about her? Lazy cow! - When are you gonna get a job? - Fuck off! What's the matter? Ain't you hungry again? - No, I ain't. - What, you on a diet? No. - You look like a skeleton. - Shut up! - It's better than being fat, ain't it? - Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. Exactly, so what you complaining about? I ain't complaining. It's you that's complaining. I ain't complaining, I like a bit of fat. Keeps me warm at nights. It's all you've got to keep you warm at night. - I'll make you some mashed potato. - I don't want mashed potato. - Chips? - I'll have a few chips. - How many's a few? - A few! - Two? - Funny. - Three? - Shut up! - You going out tonight? - Yeah. - Where are you going? - Out! - Oh, I've been there. - Have you? Yeah, it gets a bit packed, though, don't it? Yeah, it does. Who are you going out with, Scarface? Shut up! That's bang out of order, that is! Do you want this duvet cover on your bed? No, I don't. And what are you ironing that for anyway? Nobody irons duvet covers. I do, if someone pays for it. I'll iron anything within reason. I'll put a few chips on. Two, weren't it? All right, Sam? - All right? - You locked out? No. Oh, good. - Is your mum in? - Yeah. - Evening, Jason. - Yeah, all right? - She's ready for you. - Is she? Only took her two hours. All right? All right? - How you doing? - Yeah, not bad. Taking her out, are you? Yeah, of course. - Where you going, then? - Down the pub. That's nice. Where are you going? I dunno. - All right? - All right, come on. - All right, Donna? - Yeah. - Can I come, too? - No, you can't. - Why not? - Fuck off! Have a nice time without me. - You off? - Yeah. Be good. If you can't be good, be careful. Fuck off! What, am I not allowed to talk to her? There's no need to argue about it! Shut up! All right, Craig? Oi, what? What do you keep fucking looking at me for? Don't fucking look at me or I'll fucking slice you, you cunt! Fucking mug! Fucking wanker! Get your fucking hands off me! What are you doing, Dad? - Get off! - Come on, shift over. What are you looking for? - Money. - There ain't none down there. - Come on, get up. - I'm telling you, there ain't none. - Here, give us it. - No, that's mine. - Come on, give us it. - No, finders keepers. - Don't mess about. - No, fuck off! - Look, I'll give you double tomorrow. - No. I ain't joking. Well, you can borrow it, but you owe me a quid, all right? All right. Come on, let go. Ta. Yeah? - Yeah, can I come in? - Yeah. All right? Is that any good? Yeah, it's all right. You got any spare change? Yeah, I might have a bit. Only it's me what's the name. Got to pay it tomorrow. Yeah, of course. - Don't want to leave you short. - No, no, it's all right. - It's all right, I'll get it. - OK. - Where's your purse? - It's downstairs. - In your coat? - Yeah. - It's not much. - It all helps. - Are you sure? - Yeah.

Dunno. - I thought you had more sense, Donna. - Fuck off! Oh, don't get the hump, you silly cow. - Does your face hurt? - Yeah. I'll make you a cup of tea. Want some sugar? Yeah. How was work today? It was all right. That was shit. - Rory! - What? - There's no need to talk like that. - Fuck off! Rory, will you stop being rude to me, please! For fuck's sake! What is your problem? I only said I didn't like my dinner! I can't do nothing round here without you having a go at me! You do my fucking head in! Why don't you fuck off? Take no notice. - What do you want? - Is Donna there, please? - No, she ain't. - Look, I know she's fucking there! - All right, Mum, I'll sort it! - All right! All right, so what's going on? You ever touch my daughter again, I'll phone the police. - Fuck off! - Who are you talking to? - Yeah, well, I ain't talking to you! - Leave it, Mum! No, I bleedin' won't! Right, just keep out of it, right, cos it's got fuck all to do with you! Ain't it? Look what you've done to her face. Well, she's fucking asking for it, ain't she? - You coward! - Fuck off! She's coming round my house, right, threatening to tell me mum something. Tell your mum what? That she's pregnant? What? What do you tell her for, eh? - Cos she's me mum! - Fuck! - That's it, get out of my house! - Get your fucking hands off me! - Don't touch her! - Fucking... - I don't even want to be here. - What you doing here, then? She texted me, right, told me, "Come over here," so here I am. - Did you text him? - Yeah. So what's this big thing, Donna, you gotta tell me, eh? What's the great secret? - She ain't got nothing to say to you. - Typical Donna, innit, eh? I tell you what, you're twisted in the head. - You're fucking mental! - You leave her alone! And I'll tell you what, she's the worst fucking shag I've had in my life. - Yeah? - She said the same about you! I had her in your bed and all, you cunt! - Fucking mug! Bloody hell, Donna. You don't half pick 'em! - Dumped you then, has she? - Oh, fuck off! Where are you going? I'm fucking getting out of here, ain't 1? Can I come? What's the matter? Don't you like me? How are you feeling? I'm all right. - You're better off without him, you know? - I know! Bastard. Gonna keep the baby? I dunno. - What, you wanna have an abortion? - No. You want something to eat? - You're eating for two now, you know. - Shut up! - I'll make you two chips. - Ha-ha! Suit yourself. When's your first hospital appointment? I dunno. Do you want me to come with you? If you want. No fun going on your own. I know. - Let's get this off. - All right, easy, easy. What about Donna? Blimey! What you fucking thinking about her for? I ain't thinking about her, come on. No, oi, oi, what you say it for, then? Well, she's gonna be pissed off, ain't she? Look, right, I'm fucking telling you, right, don't... No, oi, don't mention her name again, yeah? Why not? Oh, fucking bullocks, right, I'm serious. Get out the fucking car, yeah? I'll fucking drive home and leave you here, yeah? Is that what you fucking want? - Fuck, no! - Nah. You're a fucking nightmare, ain't you? Yeah. All right? I was married once, you know. - Was you? - Yeah. Four months. Bitch. And she was a nurse. You get used to it. What are you doing after work? Do wanna go for a stroll in the park? Eh? We could go back to my flat. It's nice and cool up there. Only gets the sun in the mornings. Sit on the bed. Watch a video. What do you think, eh? What's up? Have I said something... eh? No. Oh. Rachel, when you got a moment, you couldn't have a look in Bertha's room? She's in the lounge now. Only she's managed to do a bit of a number twos on the carpet again. I cleaned most of it up, it just needs a bit of a mop and that, all right? All right? You're all on your own, ain't you? So? You know the centre of London, the West End? Yeah. You have been there? Oh, yeah. Ah, bon. It will be much traffic? You might be lucky. Have you got an appointment? Mais, oui! I must go to the opera, "Don Giovanni". It will take how long? Well... It's unpredictable, innit? You should be all right. Come on. Come on, babe. - There you go. - All right, Michelle? Oh, hello, Maureen. - I bought your little shirts. - Oh, right. - I thought you was coming after tea. - No. Oh! - Right. Do you want the money now? - Yeah! They ain't free! All right, Ange? All right, Maureen? Not at work today? No, it's my day off. Doing my ironing. Oil I do not like this tunnel. Why you are not tell me, "We must make the tunnel. Do you wish another route?” You say nothing. Are you claustrophobic? You must say to the passenger, "Excusez-moi, madame, "we must make the tunnel. It is OK?" C'est pas compliqué quand même. Well, we're stuck on it now, I'm afraid. Evidemment, "stuck on it". I walked through here, when I was a boy, once. South to north. Me and my best mate. My face turned completely black. He was already black. How do you get on with the whatsit, the Channel Tunnel? I'll insiste, quoi! I do not want to talk about the Channel Tunnel, OK? Or any tunnel. Anyway, with the train it is complètement différent. You see nothing. This conversation is very boring for me. Fair enough. You are married? Yeah. With children? Yeah, got two, yeah. Girl and a boy. Oh! Oh, mais c'est formidable. All right? ...fat boy! Want your ball? Here, mate. - Fucking give it back! - Here y'are. Fucking... - Go on, Gareth, spank him! - Fuck off! - Come on, let's have him! - Fuck off! - You want it, do you? - Fuck! Come on, come and get your ball back, mate. - Here y'are. - Come on, fat boy! Go on, fat boy. Get your ball back, mate. - See you, Deb. - Yeah, see you later, Maureen. Rory! Oh, sweetheart. Do you want to cry? What's the matter with him? Rory? - Chest... - You got pains? In your chest? Get an ambulance, Carol. What? Go and phone for an ambulance! - I think he's having a heart attack. - A heart attack? Is he? Yes! Carol, go on! Do you want to lie down? Here y'are, here y'are... Where are you going? You'll be all right. Oh, fuck. Hurry up! - And phone Penny. - What? Safeways! Yeah... She works in an old people's home. I'm proud of her. You are a very lucky man. We're all gonna die one day. Sans doute. - Was it a bargain? - Of course. It is for my client in New York. And your son? He work with you in the taxi? - Nah, he don't do nothing. - Comment cela? - Beg your pardon? - How he don't do nothing? - He does a lot of nothing. - Uh? Mind you... if eating was an Olympic event, he'd be the world champion by now. Ah, it is a joke. It is very funny. He is fat like you? Yeah. He's a big boy, yeah. Mum? What's the matter? What? Gotta phone an ambulance. What's happened? - Mum! - Heart attack. Who's had an 'eart attack? Fuck! Get out the fucking way! Come on! Ambulance! Fuck's sake! Alors, uh, I am there in the brasserie. I am very happy. I am dressed very nice. I am thinking it is good. I will make the twenty-five, the birthday with my son. It will be good. We will make the good relationship. Eight o'clock he is not there. Eight-thirty, nine o'clock. Les garçons are looking at me. I am ashamed. Half past nine he arrive with two girls with red plastic dresses like this. He say, eh, “Maman, I have already eaten. "We go now to the casino?" I say, "No, Nicolas, no. Ça suffit. C'est fini." Shame. We are nearly there. About five minutes. - What did your husband say? - My husband? - Yeah. - He don't say nothing. He's in Algeria. - We are divorced. - Oh. Is he still breathing? Yes. Get out the fucking way! Yeah, he's breathing. Well, I dunno. If he's breathing, he's got a pulse, ain't he? I ain't with him, I ain't there. I'm up here, he's down there. You are caring for your wife? Pardon? Do you love your wife? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's funny, innit? What's the name - love. It's like a dripping tap. Bucket's either half full... or it's half empty. If you're not together, you're alone. You're born alone... and you die alone. Nothing you can do about it. You are right. It is fucking lonely. Mum! Should have phoned Penny. - What? - Safeway. For fuck's sake, Mum! You're a waste of space. You're disgusting! I'll get the number. - Al right? - Oui, oui. - Be careful. - Yeah, I got it. Alors, on y va. What is your name? - Phil. - Phil? - Yeah. - I am Cecile. Bon. Alors, c'est par la. Penny, Penny. Hi, Penny. Mind out the way. Come on, Phil. Nearly there now, mate. OK, Rory, you're in good hands now, OK? Gladiator Cars. Dinah speaking. How can I help? Hello, it's Penny. Phil's Penny. Do you know where he is? - No. - Who's that? - Penny, Phil's wife. - Give me the phone. Hi, Penny, it's Neville. What's up? - I can't get hold of Phil. - 'I know. He's gone off the air,' and he's switched off his phone. I don't know what he's playing at. Yeah. Well, can you send us a taxi up at Safeways? I got to get down the hospital. Me son's been taken in. No problem. 'Yeah, straight away, and I'm waiting outside the front entrance.' Yeah, you just wait there, yeah? I'll get someone out to you. Yeah, all right. Yeah, ta. She's at Safeways, put a call out. Can anyone go Safeways? Is there anyone free for Safeways? "Two-Seven.' Two-seven, can you pick up Penny, Phil's wife? Yeah, I can do that. 'She's got to go to hospital.' - Is she all right? - No, it's the son. Something wrong with the son. On my way. Can I go home? Yeah... but I'm docking your wages. I'm telling Mummy. - Oh, hello, Ron. - Hi, Penny. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I nearly got in the back there. I don't know what I'm doing. I can't think straight. Rory, we're gonna sit you up, OK? After three. One, two, three... up! Now then, let's have a deep breath, please, Rory. Good. And another one. - Excellent. OK. - Lie back. Wicked. And another. Magic. And one more. Sweet as a nut. Normal breathing now. So you're not quite sure if you're a smoker, then, Rory. It's all right, I won't tell your mum. What did you have for breakfast this morning, Rory? Er... fried egg sandwich. Ooh, fried egg sandwich. Very tasty. "Course you can have a heart attack without knowing about it. - Can you? - Yeah, you just don't feel very well. Christ, there are some arseholes on the road. Fuck! Dickhead! You fucking dickhead! I didn't see you, mate. What the fuck were you doing? Oh, for fuck's sake! - I didn't see you coming round the van. - You didn't fucking look, did you? You all right, Rory? - Want another drink? - Yeah. Not too quick. Rory! Rory... What's happened to you, Rory? What's this? He's got tubes coming out of him all over. What are you doing here, Maureen? I come with him in the ambulance. Oh, did you? What happened, Rory? I couldn't breathe. He had pains... in the chest. Oh, don't worry. I'll look after you. This is my little baby boy. Where's Dad? Yeah, he'll be here in a bit. She was pissed as a fart. - Good job Samantha was in. - Yeah. - Yeah, well, thanks anyway, Maureen. - That's all right. I'm starving. I was just gonna make myself a bit of cheese on toast. Are you hungry? No. When's your Phil and Rachel coming up? Rachel ain't at home. She's probably gone up the market or something. I'll try and give her another ring a minute. My Donna ain't in either. I can't get hold of Phil. Why? Where is he? I dunno. - Hello. - Oh, hello, Rach. I'm just trying to get hold of your dad. I don't know what's happened to him. Do you get the bus all right? Yeah. He's in here. Sorry. After you. There you go. - It's his sister. - Hi. Rory. Rachel's come to see you. All right? - Rory's mum? - Yeah. Hi, I'm Simon Griffiths. I'm the doctor. I examined Rory before tea. And I bet you're Rory's sister. Yeah. Hi. Hello, Rory. So, why don't we have a sit down, and we can have a bit of a chat, OK? Make yourselves at home. Get comfy. - Is he gonna be all right? - Yeah, he's gonna be fine. We've run some tests, X-ray, checked his blood, et cetera. Ain't he had a heart attack? Well, yes and no. - What do you mean? - He's had a kind of heart attack. You see, in your heart you've got four chambers divided by a big wall of muscle, OK? And Rory's got a problem with this muscle. But he ain't never had nothing like that before. Ah, well, that's the thing, you see. He's probably had it since he was a baby, but it's only just come to light. I can't believe all this. I know. We think that's what must be wrong with Rory, but the consultant's got to have a look at him tomorrow. What's gonna happen? Well, good news is he should be home within a week. But the thing with this condition is that it won't just go away, and we can't actually cure it as such. - Can't you? - No, 'fraid not. We're gonna have to put Rory on medication. How long for? Er, probably for the rest of his life. Oh, no, that don't seem right! Not to worry. Lots of people take pills every day of their lives, and they're none the worse for it. Rory will just pop in, see a cardiologist every six months, and everything should be... cool. He's through the worst of it now. He's only little. He's been a good lad. Yeah, he is a good lad. Does he smoke? No. Yeah, he does a bit. - Fuck off! - Rory! Sorry, Doctor. Rory... Well, once Rory's decided whether he smokes or not, then he can give it up. The same goes for burgers and chips and fry-ups and crisps - all crap, eh, Rory? The sooner you get rid of them, the better it'll be for you. - Hello? - 'Phil, it's me. - "Where the bloody hell have you been?' - What's up? I've been trying to get hold of you since five o'clock this afternoon. Your phone's off, your radio's off, Neville can't get hold of you, nobody can get hold of you. What's going on? Where are you? Um... I'm on the A2. 'Rory's had a heart attack.' Phil! What? 'We're up at the hospital, South London General.' What do you mean, heart attack? What do you mean, what do I mean, heart attack? - Is he all right? - 'No, he ain't all right!' He ain't dead, is he? Of course he ain't dead. Where are you? Well, I'm just coming up to that big Chinese supermarket, 'you know the one on the roundabout, down by the...' Phil, for fuck's sake! Just hurry up and get here, all right? Pen? Hello? It's funny, I'm starving, but I can't eat this. Got a bleedin' headache. - Do you want a bit? - No, ta. Is he gonna be all right? - Yeah, he's in good hands. Hear that baby? Yeah. Look at you. Come here. Shift up. Are you scared? We'll be all right. 'Ere... What if it's a boy? Just forget about it. How can I forget about it? - I'll fucking kill him. - Yeah. You gonna phone the police, Dad? - No. - Why not? I'll do it in the morning. - Do it now. - No. - I'll phone 'em. - Leave it. Give us that bit of paper. Dad! What? That bloke's gonna get away with it, ain't he? It's none of your fucking business. You phoned Penny yet? You ain't, have you? You don't give a shit, do you? You're useless - you're both fucking useless. I'm going out. What? Oh, God. Oh, fucking hell, what have you done? Why did you do that, eh? - Oh, fuck! - It's all right, I love you an' all. I don't love you, all right? I don't even like you. You need to get that seen to. You need to go to hospital, all right? It's not funny... It's not funny! Not... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Can I help you? That's my boy. Can you tell me his name, please? Rory Bassett. OK, Mr Bassett, in you go. - Right. - It's only two by a bedside. OK... sorry. He's only allowed two by the bed. Yeah. I'll wait outside, then. Don't be stupid, you've only just got here. No, it's all right. Get yourself a cup of tea. I'll just wait outside. All right? Yeah. He's asleep now. Is he? - Has he had an operation? - No. I got lost downstairs. The bloke said, "Go upstairs..." Yeah, all right, Phil, you're here now, ain't you? What happened? Well, he collapsed. Maureen was with him when I come up here. He's got to take pills for the rest of his life. You never know what's gonna happen, do you? It's what's the name... fait accompli. He might win the lottery tomorrow. It's kismet, ain't it? What are you talking about? Where have you been? Out and about, you know. Where? Been on a long run, down... You're supposed to be a taxi, Phil. What are you doing with your radio switched off? And your mobile? What's the point of having them if we can't get hold of you when we need you? - Yeah, I know what you mean. - It's pathetic! Leave it out, Mum. Stop having a go at him. Rory! I ain't having a go at him. It's all right. You all right, Dad? All right, mate? You been in the wars, ain't you? Do you wanna go on holiday? What? We'll all go away when he's better. Yeah? The four of us. Yeah? Disney World? What? It is past ten o'clock. Don't want to leave him. I know, but the night staff will take good care of him. OK. Rory? We've got to go home now. - I'll be back in the morning. - All right. All right, mate? I love you, Rory. Got to go home now. - Is he asleep? - Yeah. Nearly. He'll be all right. Making a cup of tea? Yeah. Do you want one? No, I'll have a hot chocolate. - Do you want a beer? - No. I wish I could have stayed the night up there with him. Yeah. Well, they'll have drugged him up. Knocked him out till morning. Wouldn't they, Rach? Yeah. First thing, then. Run you up there. - No, you don't have to do that. - No, it's all right, I won't hang about. I'll come in with you, say hello, make sure he's all right, and then get straight on the radio, start work as soon as I can. He'll be surprised, won't he? Neville. He's a bit, what's the name, unpredictable, ain't he? He might not have me. There's a lot of blokes work mornings regular. I might pick up some airport runs. If he says no, I'll try somewhere else, I don't care. Yeah, I don't want to talk about it now, Phil. No, I mean it. I'm gonna do it. I'm determined to do it. Got to get started, get saving. Shouldn't take long. I'll work seven days a week. Start early, finish late. Do nights, weekends... Phil! Rory is in hospital! Yeah. Sorry. But I made him a promise. And I'm gonna keep it. What promise? About going on holiday. - Phil! - They do these deals, don't they? Disney World - these two nurses I picked up was telling me about it. They do these all-in packages. Er, what's the name... fly-drive. Florida, ain't it? Phil, it ain't about going on holiday. It's about getting by, week in, week out. It ain't a game. Just cos you've suddenly got some bee in your bonnet about getting up in the mornings and going to work when you've been lying in bed for years till God knows what time. And we're all supposed to be grateful cos you've decided to do what normal people do. I get up in the mornings, Rachel gets up in the mornings... You make me sick. Doctor was asking about you. About your heart and stuff, your family. If anyone in your family has had a heart attack. There was your Uncle Dougie, weren't there? Me nan had one an' all. Oh, yeah. - Me mum's mum. - I forgot about that. Me dad's oldest brother. What's his name... in Australia. There you are, then. It's all on side, innit? Ain't none on mine. Are you going to work in the morning, Rach? You don't have to, you can phone in. I dunno. I ain't going. If you do... when you're done, give us a bell on me mobile. Run you up the hospital, see your brother, yeah? Oh, you'll have it switched on, then, will you? Not like today. Your son's in hospital, having a heart attack, and we can't get hold of you. They can get hold of me. They know where I am in an emergency. But we can't get hold of his dad nowhere. Where was you anyway? What you been doing all day? I switched it off. Yeah, I know you switched it off. Why did you switch it off? I'd had enough. You'd had enough? Had enough of what? Had enough of working for five minutes, so you switched it off? What can I switch off when I've had enough? Had enough of getting up every morning, going to work, doing the shopping, coming home, cooking the tea, cleaning the house, doing the ironing, making sure everyone's got clean clothes on their back. What can I switch off when I've had enough? Had enough of what, anyway? Everything. What? What everything? For God's sake, Phil. You don't love me no more, do you? What? You don't love me. Phil, what are you talking about? What's that got to do with anything? It's got to do with everything. Rory has had a heart attack. You ain't loved me for years. You don't like me. You don't respect me. You talk to me like I'm a piece of shit. - I don't! - You do. ...I don't, Phil. I don't talk to you like you're a piece of shit! You do, Pen. You don't know you're doing it, but you do. That's stupid! That ain't fair! Why are you saying all this to me? It's... It's what's the name... Unbearable! What? What's unbearable? You don't love me no more. Do you? Do you love me? I've got to know. If you don't love me no more... I might as well go. Go? Where are you gonna go? I dunno. If I'm... If I'm making you unhappy, you know what I mean... [, uh... I ain't got no skills. I don't earn enough money. I know I'm a disappointment to you, and I get on your nerves. It's like... It's like something's died. I feel like an old tree that ain't got no water! When we first met... I couldn't believe it. Pretty girl like you going with a fat bloke like me. People looking at us. I felt like the bee's knees. We ain't got much. But we got each other. And that's enough. But if you don't want me, we ain't got nothing. We ain't a family. And that's it. Sorry. I know it ain't very helpful... what with Rory and that... but I couldn't hold it in. I don't talk to you like that, Phil. That's what it feels like. Do you want a tissue? I've got some. Yeah. Shirt's all wet. Rachel? What are you doing there? Rach? You do talk to him like that. Do I? Sometimes. Is she all right? Yeah. What did she say? She... She's just a bit upset, that's all. Yeah. Do you... Do you want one of these? No. I'm all right, thanks. What? Oh. Strange, isn't it? What? Dunno. I feel cut off all the time. Sort of... ...lonely. Yeah. Me an' all. Do you? I love you. You used to make me laugh. Yeah. Do you want to go to bed? Yeah. Busy day tomorrow. - Oh, yeah, must be up here. - Yeah. - That's it. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah, there he is. - There he is. Yeah, that's nice, by the window. All right? All right? - There are no chairs. - Yeah. There's a couple over there. Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks. He looks better, don't he? Got a bit of colour in his cheeks. Yeah. How'd they get you up here? I come up in a wheelchair. - Did you? - Yeah. Got you some bananas, mate. Cheers. Here, I got you something an' all. - Yeah, what is it? - Well, open it. What is it, a towel? - No, it's a dressing-gown. - Dressing-gown? What do I need a dressing-gown for? Yeah, for when you go toilet and that. All right, well, stick it in there. - What's this? Slippers? - Yeah. Cheers. - They're moccasins, ain't they? - Yeah, nice one. They'll sort you out. You had something to eat? Yeah, I had fish. - Did you? - No? - Yeah. - What, in batter? Nah, with like... sauce on the top, like, cheese. - Cor blimey! - Do you eat it? - Yeah. - What, tie you down, did they? No, it was nice. I had that and mash and, like, green cauliflower stuff. Oh, yeah, broccoli. - I don't know... but I ate it all. - That's good. Blimey. You all right? Yeah. She ain't been back to work yet. Yeah, I'm going to go back tomorrow. Why ain't you been in? Well, I ain't been sleeping. Why not? She's been worried. What about? About you! We all have. Shut up, I'm all right. Yeah, you are now. - You've got a bit of fluff on your... - Oh! - Did an airport this morning. - Yeah, five o'clock! - Bloody hell! - Yeah. Took this family to Gatwick. They was going to... what's the name, uh... Cyprus. This bloke, two little boys, an old woman. Yeah. We was going along, and the kids started giggling, yeah, and the littlest one says, "Here, Dad, she's farted." - Here, don't make him laugh. - Yeah. Are you hurting? He's all right. Anyway, so, he turns round, he starts clumping her, says, "Don't be rude about your grandma!" He was swearing in Greek and that. I had to open a window. It was... No, it was... - Had all sorts in that car. - That's right, yeah. You all right, Rach? Yeah. You want to be careful, you. Got talking to anyone in here? No, I ain't. Only just got up here, ain't you? I ain't spoken to no one. Did you get a card from your nan? Yeah.
