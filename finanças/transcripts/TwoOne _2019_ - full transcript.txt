Matt Hopkins looking at how the weather's shaping up right now. Yeah, that's right. So cold air traveling from Asia across the Pacific will hit the west coast of Canada. But there are warnings in every single province. Those winds are going to be up over 100 kilometers per hour and it's gonna be really cold air. Snowfall amounts-- Come on. Come on. Please stand back from the doors. You have one unheard message. Hey, Kaden, it's Martha. Surprise. Umm, I, I got your number from your mom. I saw your picture in the paper... And, yeah, you and that umbrella kind of made my day. Uhm, I'm actually back in Vancouver now. I just wanted to say hey. Hey. - In the front. - Huh? The front. It's good, eh? Did you know they were taking your picture? No idea. What do I owe you? I've never been in the paper. It's on me. - Thanks. - See you. Bye. 33, 34, 35... Don't sag, 36. Come up, 37, 38, 39-- Kaden, I don't need you burning out like this. - I'm all right. - I know you jumped the other day without me here. - Now, look. You could've hurt yourself. - Come on, man, give me a break. - A break? - Yeah. A break is exactly what you need. - I need you light. - You want me to trust you? You train half the other guys in this gym. So, so what? These kids are gonna take your place one day, anyway. Yeah, maybe. But not yet. - Let's go, other leg. - No. Take the day off. And, really, think about how many jumps you got left. How many 35-year-old active jumpers do you know? You can't jump forever. - Hello? - Martha? Wow, hey. - Hi, it's Kaden. - I know. I'm just surprised you called back. - It's been forever. - Yeah. - It's been ages, huh? - Yeah, it really has. - Uhm, how you doing? - I'm good, I'm good. How are you? Uh, yeah, yeah, all right. Uhm... Yeah, not too bad, I'm... doing pretty good. This is... This is weird, right? - Yeah, still, still not so good on the phone, huh? No, no, I... We should, we should meet - in, in person. - Yeah, I'd love to. How about tomorrow? Or next week or, you know. Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow works. How about 3:00 at the Brickhouse? Yeah, yeah, sounds good. Uhm... I'll be wearing the helmet and the goggles, in case you forgot what I looked like. Okay, great. - All right, see you then. - Bye, Kaden. Still jumping? That's right. You know, I'm competing tomorrow, actually. Regional? Qualifiers. World Championships in Sapporo are happening. Wow! Sounds like a big deal. Huge. You can find it on cable if you look hard enough. It's still good. Don't be humble. True. Are you ready for this exhibition? Oh, I am ready. Thank you. Creepy. It's quiet. I don't think the last guy made it. It's pointing right at us. - Okay. - I don't like this. It's following us. I'm staying behind you. - Oh, my gosh. - You go... Okay, we'll split. Yeah, I'm scared of this thing. This is private property. You have ten seconds to leave the premises. Oh, god. - Coffee? - Oh yeah. Let's do it. I'm gonna write a review. - Did you like it? - I did. Kind of weird. Kaden, just so you know, right now, I'm not in an art gallery. I'm visiting my cousin. I should've mentioned before... I'm married. I got a daughter. Anna. That's great. No, I heard you were back and I think I may have heard you had a baby. Are you seeing someone? Ah, just these twins at the moment. Brazilian. No, nothing serious, really. I've seen a girl or two. I've tried, but nothing's really worked out. I guess I'm... I'm more of a loner. Tell me about it. Drove me nuts. Is that why you never came back? Don't go there, Kaden. I mean, you vanished. You never chased. I'm sorry... about everything. Wait, what did you just say? Sorry? Oh, it just took a photo of a stupid umbrella and ten years for you to say that. All right. Go, Kaden! All right, Kaden! - Do it! - Go, Kaden! Good job, Kay, attaboy. Nice first one. - That's it, that's the one. - You know, that felt real good. Yeah, you looked good out there, Kay. - All right. - All right. See you. Fuck. He made good time. Hey, yo! There's no smoking in here. At least, don't let the cameras catch you, yeah? So, what was that, big man? I don't know. Well, the north wind's picked up. Should help. Got it. Well... I don't know how to say this... but, Kay, when it's over... it's over. Breaks my heart to see you like this. Christ, man... leave on a high. Fly the fuck out of here. Okay? Kaden? - Hey. - I thought you were jumping. Yeah, no, I am jumping. Yeah, well, I'm watching you on the TV, how come, - how come you're on the phone? - You know, I'm sponsored by this phone company. And I got to use the thing while I'm jumping. - It's a little crazy. - Yeah, I've seen your phone. It's a piece of shit. This one! Listen, I wanted to apologize-- What, no! It was good to see you, come on. Yeah, true. Uh, I should probably let you go-- Sorry. It's uhm... It's my dad's birthday tomorrow, and it would be nice if I brought somebody along. Are you crazy? It's just lunch, Martha. No, it's not just lunch. And it wasn't just coffee yesterday either. I'm about to jump, and this might be the biggest, most important jump of my life. That's blackmail. No... It's my ticket to Sapporo. Just say yes. Daddy, no! In the outfit. Listen, I'll go, okay? But I'll go as myself. - Meaning what? - As a married woman. That's what I mean. Yeah, sure, fine. But you don't have to rub it in. I'm not some charity case. One o'clock. My parents' house. Remember? Yeah, I'll meet you there. Now, go focus on your jump. I don't want a depressing lunch. Yeah, yeah, I'll see what I can do. Bye. Yeah! Woo! Oh! - Mary fucking Poppins! - Jesus. Happy birthday, Dad. Where's the umbrella? - Hey, the jumper! - Hey, hey, hey. - So, where is she, then? - Oh, come on. Well done yesterday, brother. Thank you. You're looking good, Kaden. - Where's your date? - Seriously. - She's gone again? - Alfred, enough! - What's up with these guys? Have they been drinking? - Mm-hmm. You'll not like this either, because there's tomato sauce on it. Oh, I-- Tomato sauce, Ma, is fine. Why do you always put the brussels sprouts in with the potatoes? - I told you not to do that. - It's pretty. - Dad, don't. - Just eat them, Dad. They're going to the same place. We want to hear about the jump. Tell us about the jump. - Yeah. - Bring it on. Yeah, well, the wind picked up right after I launched... carried me to the glide. - Lucky jump, I guess. - Yeah. Lucky. Oh! The ghost. - She's here. Just a friend, okay? - Yep, friend. - Behave. Especially you, Dad. - Sure. What's that they say? Friends with... - Hey. - Hey. - Well done yesterday. - Glad you made it. Sorry I'm late. I had this chaotic morning with Anna and... Anyway, long story. Well, thanks for showing up. Oh, stop. I didn't mean it like that. - Couple of years? - A while. - No, ten. - Ten years? No, more than that. I already told them that you're here as a friend and they're taking the piss out of me, so... Kaden, we are friends. And I don't get out much, so... - Let's have fun! - Okay. Alfred's on a roll. Count on that. So... So the clerk is trying to tell this old lady, who was standing in front of me that it's her turn to step up. But she can't hear him. She's got plugs in her ears. She's probably, you know, listening to music. She starts digging in her purse and looking for something. So I started shouting at this old lady. And I finally get her attention. She turns to look at me, I'm this close, and suddenly her face goes all white. And I'm thinking, "Shit. She's having a heart attack." - Dad! - Wow. Yeah, well, she deserved it. But what if she dies, right there in front of me? I mean, does that make me a murderer? Just 'cause I was shouting at her? Maybe she was hard of hearing, maybe she was wearing a hearing aid. And then, Thomas here comes to mind, and I'm thinking, "Well, maybe I should ask a court of law what they make of it all." But then, I thought, "Do I really - want Thomas here to be the one to defend me?" - There it is. So, I dialed it down just a notch. Well, you couldn't afford me, Alfred. I should've shouted her to death. Olina, this is perfect. Thank you. It was so nice when she called the other day, I must say. I know, I was looking on the paper, I was like, "Oh, my god, is that Kaden? I know this guy." Oh, my god. So photogenic, right? - A toast to my son, who made it into the newspaper. - Toast to Kaden. - Here, here. - Kaden has made it into the newspaper many times, Dad. Shouldn't we be toasting to Sapporo? - Yeah. - Let's toast to Martha. - She's back in the trenches. - Alfred. Alfred, you're annoying everyone. Don't worry, Mom, he's just mad he's turning 110. To the old man! That's right. A little respect. - To the old man! - Happy birthday. So, what's going on there? She still looks damn good. - Martha's married, Dad. She's got a kid. - Ouch. Come on. You might need a bit more than that. I got something to tell you. - I'm gonna divorce your mom. - What? - Are you insane? - Shh. She doesn't know yet. - You're 70 years old, Dad. - So what? I should drag it out, because I haven't got a lot of years left? Just try to get along. She keeps nagging at me. She doesn't listen, she just shouts. Which is exactly the reason I can't tell her. I've been pretending for too long. Dad, this would devastate her. You're not joking, are you? I'm afraid not. I'm 70, for fuck's sake. You can be such an asshole sometimes. Listen. Do not say anything to Mom yet. Promise me that. You're drunk. - Hey... - Promise me that. We all have to face ourselves sooner or later. What does that even mean? I'm gonna go water my snake. And Martha... She's still smoking. - Let me get that. - Hey. - Oh, Dad, you're gonna love this. - Just leave it there, honey. ¶ Emma eats bread and butter ¶ ¶ Like a queen would have Ostrich and cobra wine ¶ I do love it! - Got your old Mustang back. - I'm glad you like it. Kaden, what's wrong? Nothing. ¶ I've never done this ¶ ¶ Baby be gentle It's my first time ¶ ¶ I've got you inside ¶ ¶ People are boring ¶ - Whoa! - Whoa! I wanna get some fresh air. - Do you mind if we go? - Yeah. Let me go help your mom with the dishes and say thank you. 70-year-old people don't get divorced. He was probably tipsy, Kaden. I know my dad. He means it. All this time for what? What's the fucking point? So wrong. Stop the car. - Please stop the car. - Yeah, yeah. What's the matter? What's that? It feels like the first time. I thought we did that a long time ago. I didn't come this time either. What a mess. You don't have to explain. I wish you would have had my children. Let's get you home. Next station-- ¶ Still into ¶ ¶ Life and you ¶ ¶ Will go to great lengths ¶ ¶ For you ¶ ¶ Torn from view ¶ Hey. - Okay! - Kaden. Coming! Hey. You deaf? Oh, my god. Dad, why don't we do this? I'll take you home, you say you're sorry to Ma. I'll talk to her. She'll be fine. Get her some flowers. Take her on a vacation. What? You got a problem. You know that? That's what I've been trying to tell you. You're an idiot, too. - Fact. - Yeah, you and me both. Up. Nice, nice. Keep your back nice and straight. Hey, hey. - Big man from the hill. - Hey. I've got your doctor's prescription. Thank you. Hey, is that your dad? I'm afraid so. He says he's divorcing my mom. Do you mind if he crashed in one of the rooms for a night or two? No, no, that's fine. I'll sort him out. You go get ready, yeah? You mind if I get to the hill and take a few jumps? - You got a spotter? - Roger's up there. - Okay, good. - All right. You know, at 30 you make a mistake, you can start over. - At 70, Dad-- - Suddenly not okay? There's always a reason not to do it. At 40, you have kids. You don't wanna mess it up for them. At 50, you've got the lawyers to think about. What about leaving Mom on her own? That was my excuse at 60. Not anymore. Do you even give a shit about her? How long have you been planning this? Everything comes with an expiration date. You know that. Jesus Christ, Dad. Why bother, then? I got this theory. Humans... Average lifespan of what, 80? 85 maybe? A thousand years ago, life expectancy was about 30 years. Marriage made sense. Imagine if people lived, say, - about 200 years? - Where is this going? Every couple in the world would get divorced. The biggest love story of all time? Romeo and Juliet. Didn't live together for a single day. Would you stop doing that? - Huh? - Huh? Would you stop doing that? - Yeah, yeah. - You know, people are eating. Kaden, he's just a kid. What, you didn't like my theory? No, I'm glad you're leaving Mom. You're a prick. Oh. Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt. Plane tickets, itinerary and contact numbers if you need anything in Japan. My man. You are finally getting rid of me. There has never been a 35-year-old jumper who has won in Sapporo. I googled that. So... you can either become a fool or a legend. - What happens, happens. - Well, make it count, champ. - You got it. - Okay. What is wrong with being a fool? Some of my best friends are fools. This is breaking and entering. How're you doing? Better. - You good? - I'm good. Kaden, I've got to go. I was waiting for you to say that. Yeah, I gotta go be a mom. Okay, leave the money and go. You are such a jerk. Hi. - These for you? - Yes. These babies are strong. No alcohol. And no more than one a day. Unless you're a rhino. You're not a rhino, are you? I'm not a rhino. Then we have an understanding. Okay. Hey, it's Martha. Leave a message. Hey, yeah, just wanted to give you a call and tell you I'm off to the airport. Wish me luck, maybe. Bye. ¶ Wild, white horses ¶ ¶ They will take me away ¶ ¶ And the tenderness I feel ¶ ¶ Will send The dark underneath ¶ ¶ Will I follow? ¶ Anna. Anna. Hey, it's Martha, leave a message. Outside the aircraft, your flotation device can be... Strong winds over Japan. We have been forced to land at Seoul. Sorry for the inconvenience. Fuck. We're terribly sorry to announce that Sapporo Flight 237 has been delayed, once again due to the weather conditions. We apologize for the inconvenience. We'll be departing as soon as we are able. Hey, buddy. Wake up. Hey. You okay? Wake up. Hey, buddy. Hey! Hello? Hey, buddy. I know you. Hey... I fucking know you. Hey, wake up! Hey. You okay, man? Flight 347 to Tokyo, please board at gate 21. Flight 5343 to Thailand, please board at gate 16. Seven, one, one, three, two is now ready for boarding. For an on-time departure we would like to ask first and business class passengers, Star Alliance Gold members to board first. No. No. No! Hey, I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm so sorry, excuse me. Did Flight 237 leave? - Yes. - Fuck. Just give me one second, please. I'm a ski jumper. I have a tournament in Sapporo tomorrow. We fly tomorrow morning. No, no, no, I need to fly tonight. You missed the plane by five hours. It's not my fault! You made me land here! I need to travel tonight. Can you get me on another flight? - Can you get me on that flight, please? - Not us. Okay, where can I do that? Outside. Buy ticket. Oh, god. Yeah, thanks. I hate fucking flying. I hate fucking Japan. Jesus Christ. Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah, fuck you. See you. Oh, fuck! God damn it! Fuck. Hi. Registration? Hi. Kaden Russell. You missed the reception last night. Is that correct? Yeah, not keen on receptions. But I love delayed flights. You're the last one to register. Maybe a good sign. Here you go. You still have 45 minutes left to do some test jumps if you hurry. All right. - You all right, man? - Yes. Just my shoulder. Tomas Garner, from Vermont. Big fan. - Thanks. - Grew up watching you on TV with my folks. 2009... that jump was amazing, man. I wish I could pass on some advice, but sorry, I have nothing. Don't sweat it. You got some for me instead? Some advice. Haven't got many jumps left, so everybody keeps reminding me. Just go for it, man. All right. I'll take all of that. It's the next one on the right. Sugar? No, thanks. You heard about Alfred? Fifty years. Bastard. I'm so sorry, Olina. You know, everyone... People should be happy that I'm no longer with him. I mean, I still do all his laundry, though. - Where is he? - Kaden's. Did you want to see him? Yeah. ¶ You are the sound it flies ¶ ¶ You are the sound it flies ¶ ¶ You don't have ¶ ¶ To be alone ¶ ¶ You don't have ¶ ¶ To be alone ¶ ¶ You are the sound it flies ¶ ¶ The sound flies home ¶
