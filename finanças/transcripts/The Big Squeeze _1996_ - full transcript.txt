Agh. Morning Jesse. Nice roses. Thank you, Enrique. My name is Henry. Henry. Sorry Enrique. Excuse me. How you doin'? Listen, you ah... you don't wanna dig your weeds like that. You wanna slice'em like this. You left the root in the soil. Well, you wanna have a jog next week, don't ya? Some beautiful roses. Mm. They're beautiful. Nothing's too good for my angel. Thanks. So um what time did you get home this morning, like, 4:30, 5 o'clock? We were short-handed. I had to help out. My wife working in a bar... Someone has to pay the bills. Listen, when my knee's better, I'm going back to baseball. I'm gonna make the majors, you'll see. When we get money again, I want a car. I want to go places. Forgive me Lord, but I've indulged my wife in the pursuit of carnal fulfillment again. OK, Father. Inspector. Father. Well, the biggest problem is the tower in the main structure, all unreinforced Adobe and unfinished work here from the last earthquake. The southwest wall has cracks in it you could put your goddamn arm through. Hell I... Ahem. Oh, excuse me, Father, Fathers. What's the bottom line, Inspector? Yes, what's the bottom line? The bottom line is that the LA City Department of Building and Safety is ordering you to have the mission retrofitted to meet earthquake safety codes. Ah, you've got six months to get it done. Six months or what? Or what? Or we close you down permanently. Inspector, we have no money. No money. Just doing my job. Have a nice day. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom all night long. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Boom, boom all night long. Oh, yeah, Jesse, amigo. Hard day pullin' weeds today. Yeah, I missed the ones growin' under your ass. How'd you guess? Your eyes speak more than words, Jesse. Didn't know I talk so much. Bartenders hear everything. Hola Jessito. Hola, Cece. How's it goin' with those weed? Still doin' that slice that I I taught ya? Ah, ya gotta protect that bread and butter and that beer. Name's Benny. Oh? That's right, O, Benny O'Malley. And ah I didn't catch your name. Mr. Majestic, picks up dog shit for a living. Have you ever walked through this man's park before? Have you ever taken the time to notice the petals on the roses, the crimson reds and the saffron yellows? They're beautiful. And his lawns, carpets of brilliant green cut to utter perfection. I mean if a dog shit on his lawn, I'd pick it up myself. And I don't even work there. So you should take the time to walk through that park sometime, Mister. Jesse boy. OI, what a motor mouth on that one. Oo, and cute too. Now that's one boy who don't got a deep pocket on him. And if he does, it ain't stuffed with no green roll. He's broke. You take'em. Thanks. What do you have? Ah, I'll have a beer, please. Ah, unfortunately I don't have any money. Then you got a problem. Well, I never met a problem that didn't come with a solution. I'll tell you what. I have two cards here. One of these cards is Ace of spades. You pick it, and I get a free beer. And if I pick another card? Well, then you win a diamond necklace. Or don't ya gamble? Never had the chance. Now you show me someone who's never had a chance, and I'll show you someone who's never took one. So I just pick a card? Shit. But you win. And that's as close as I'm gonna get to seein' diamonds, right? That's right. I... I think I should get a free beer anyway. I mean, I... I did get you to gamble. I mean, don't ya think I should get a free beer. I think that's fair. Thank you. You think I can get a shot too? Another free beer Mr. Money Bags? Where's ah... Tanya? Poor Romeo didn't get a good bye? Do you know how long ago she left? What's it to ya? Hey. Just... Where's Tanya? Gone sad boy. Somebody's walking her home. Hello Tanya. Catch your breath yet? Well, you never said good bye. Good bye. By the way, my name's Benny. You don't give up, do ya? Figure I could walk ya home? No. Good I needed fresh air. Shall we? Hm? My mamacita always say, the world is for those who grab it by the nacas. Good night. Good night. Oh, boy, so soon? Well, we don't want to wake my husband, do we? Oh, you didn't tell me you had a husband. There's a lot I didn't tell you, Benny. By the way, I ah, lied about that necklace. I know. No, no, sweetheart, I mean I lied when I said I lied. Oo, that's perty. Why are ya givin' me this? It's you. I can't keep this. Good night. Good night. I don't blame a girl for doin' what she thinks she should. So much fun finding someone who... ...she says... Hm. Were ya gonna tell me something a few minutes ago? In a little cafe just the other side of the border. She was a sittin' there and givin' me looks that made my mouth water. So I started walkin' her way. She belonged to that man Jose. Then I knew, yes, I knew I should leave when I heard her say, come a little bit closer, you're my kind of man so big and so strong. Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone and the night is so long. La, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la. Oh. Oh. Good job. Thank you very much. Based on a thorough inspection of all the structures and our breakdown of the city's order, we're looking at four months on to tower, three on the main building. And um, what, two to four on the others. We have six months. We have six months. OK. We'll get it done in six. Oh, and ah the cost? It's the lower right, sir, ah, Father. Oh. Well, it might take us a little time to get 13 ah... Oh, the decimal point is here, Father. Well, thank you for coming in ah, and we will call you. All right. Ah, number's at the top. So long. But we'll um, we'll shop around. No one else can do it in six months. What's in the reserve account? It's down to 6,000. Archdiocese? Allocations are suspended for two years. Donations? Down 50%. Same as attendance. It's as if we needed a... A what, Father? A... a stroke of good luck? Henry? Hey Hey. What are you doing home? Well, Mondays are so slow, so I thought I'd stay home and cook. Dumpling stew. Your favorite, mm, come on. Sit down. Oh, that is so good. Ah, what? Two years and five months. Huh? Since your accident. Oh, well. Remember after your accident when um the team refused to pay your medical costs? Yeah. And I went to the state office 26 times until they agreed to take the owner to court. And I got a job working seven nights a week to pay for your medical costs and our living expenses. And we agree to share the money if it ever came? We never heard from anyone about that did we? No. We never got that money, did we? No. I guess you must be your new bank's favorite customer. I thought we agreed that we would not read each other's mail. The money is ours, Henry. - The money stays in my bank. - Why? Why? We need that money. Money is the devil's calling card. He's not welcome in this home. End of discussion. End of discussion? What a great discussion. You sit around all day long praying to God. And you can't sit and talk to your own wife? Don't bring the Lord into this. Henry, what happened to the man I married? The man you married is sitting right here. And his word on his money is final. I have a right to some say in this. You have the right to shut up about the money. Your baseball days are over, Henry. Ugh. Tanya, Tanya, Tanya. Get off of me. I'm sorry. Don't touch me. I'm sorry Mrs. Mulhill, I realize that you're his wife. But per his request, Mr. Mulhill is the only signatory on this account. The law dictates that we must abide by Mr. Mulhill's request. Hey, what's up, Jose? Hey what's happenin'? Aye, bonita. It's the first of the month. The pendejo's payday is our payday. Deep pockets for all one lovely night. They work, make money. We work and take their money. My mamacita said that's how the pinche world turns. Of course, even though my mamacita worked in bars, she didn't pour on drinks. Aye, Oh, I am good. When did you get that necklace? Last night. Is he stayin' with you? Why? You wanna borrow him? Ugh. Hi. If that dress were any shorter it'd be a belt. You look beautiful. Your things are gone. I left you. Angel, we had a little argument. Ah, we can work it out. We can work it out. Never. Never what? Never what? Just never. Hi sweetheart. Boy do you look great. Look at that. You lock the door? Of course I locked the door. You got a deal. No, Benito, you got the deal. Excuse me. Oh, this is good. I like this. I like this. You wanna dance? No, not really. - You know the Latin hustle? - Can't say I do. So what brings a nice guy like you to a place like this? Well, the ride ended. I bet you're good at takin' people for rides, huh? Mm-hm. Where' we goin'? What's on your mind, sweetheart? Love or money? Money. Mm. How much? $65,141.23. It's half, my half. And ah, who's who's got the rest of this ah $130,282.46? Henry, my husband. And where does Henry keep this money? In his bank. Mm-hm. What, you have his and her banks? Now we do. Let me guess. Henry just had some money comin' to him recently. And of course you want your half. Did he ah buy a lottery ticket with your dollar? Or did you buy a lottery ticket with his dollar? Insurance settlement. And now he put the money into a new account? Exactly. And now you wanna take the money out of the account and put it in your pocket? Yes, I do. How? I don't know. Are you asking me how? Not exactly. Mm, that's good. That's good. 'Cause I don't like stings. What's a sting. I don't ah do business with beginners. And I don't usually do business with guys who give the same necklace to two different girls. What's a sting? A, deceive someone into giving you their money. B, keep it. Usually very dangerous and not worth the trouble. On the other hand, 130 grand might be worth a little trouble. All I want is my half. Well, then divorce him. The law says you get half. He's a devout Catholic. Well, then kill him. The law says you get both halves, yours and mine. That's not funny. Well, then, my dear, it seems like you got a problem. Well, I never met a problem that didn't come with a solution, right? Woo. 50:50 of your half. 10%. You gotta spend to make it in this world, sweetheart. Give to get, 10% ain't very giving. 15%. 50%. 20% 50%. I'll give you 1/3 and that's final. And I'll get you a picture of Henry from his days on 3rd base. Oh, he's a ballplayer, huh? Was, everything he ever was, was. Never saw two people spend so much time at a jukebox. We ah couldn't agree on a number. You know the Latin hustle? Can I ask you a favor, Jesse? I appreciate this. Really, thanks. Oh. Did you? Oh, yeah. Wow. I didn't know you were an artist. I'm not. This is just a hobby. Do you paint anything besides flowers and plants? Not really. It's beautiful. Thanks. Um, you get the bed. OK. - Benito? - Yeah, baby? How long? How long what? Me and you. What kinda question is that? Oh. Is that blanket enough? Yeah, it's perfect. It's a warm night. You need another pillow or something? No, five's plenty. I remember when I was a... a kid, I used to ah... I used to go over to my grandma's house, and she used to have, like, 1,000 pillows on every couch and bed. And I used to go under the pillows and... and I'd fall asleep. And I'd wake up the next morning, and I... I'd see the light comin' in through the cracks. And I'd pretend I was trapped in a cave. Good night. Morning, baby. Morning. Hey, do you have a man's shirt I can borrow? Hm. Do I have a man's shirt? Baby, I got me a pinche souvenir shop. Oh, Jesus. Is the pitcher ready? Just throw it over the plate. Morning Henry. Morning Father. How you doin', Father? Hello. What happened to your tree? The woods decay. The woods decay and fall. The vapours weep their burdens... Ah to the ground. ...to the ground. Man comes and tills the field that lies beneath. And after many a summer, dies the swan. Dies the swan, yeah. Tennyson, right? Hm? Ah, yeah, right. Huh. Say, Father? Where'd you come up with that number? Earthquake repairs? I...I told you sweetheart, this is a very dangerous game here, OK, especially when one has absolutely no idea how to separate the victim from half of his money. The 28th, the 28th of every month, Henry makes a donation to the mission. What? Three years ago on the 28th of August, Henry broke his knee. So he gives all this money to God hoping and praying for some sort of miracle, my money. He gives'em your money? My tip money. He doesn't work, remember? Let's see the 28th, ah, it's about five days away. I... I don't... I don't have enough time for that. That's all the time we got. Do you realize that we're talking about grand theft, tax evasion, fraud, conspiracy, so ah this better be worth my while. What'll make it worth your while? I would say 50/50 of all of it would be fair. All of it? Too much wrist. Less is always more. So ah how are things going with the new roommate? Good. Getting a little crowded in there? Not crowded, cozy. Listen, Jess, this is probably none of my business. But I'm a little curious here. You pullin' a decent check with this gig, you know, enough to treat someone special the way they deserve to be treated, like with a nice dinner and candles and cloth napkins and tasty wines you can't pronounce? You're right. It's none of your business. Well, then I take it you wouldn't be interested in ah extra income. Here you go. Oh, thank you. You're welcome, Father. Say listen, um, I know someone who can help you with your gardening. He's very good, very experienced. And I'll tell you what, just for you, it comes with a one week free, no obligation trial period. Is that right? That's right. Actually, he works for me. One week free? Absolutely. Excuse me. Um, maybe you could help me. I'm looking for something sort of specific. Hm, now you're gettin' the hang of it, Jesse. You waste little time, Benny. Well, Father, if there's one thing I learned in the gardening business is that you gotta move fast and never turn a blind eye. As long as it gets done and I'm not doin' it. Oo, hey, Father, Father? Listen, would you mind if I ah dropped a little seed in the planter there? What kind of seed? It's a ah Magnolia to ah symbolize the mission's eternity. Then plant yourself a forest. Well, well, Father, Father? I... I know this sounds silly. But do you think that maybe you could bless my seed? Bless the seed? Well, you don't have to if you don't want to. I just figured it might be a little luck. Oh, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sure. Sure. Thank you very much, Father. Hey, Jesse. Will you put some dirt on that for me, please? What are you guys planting? Ah, I'm planting Magnolia seed. Magnolia? Hm. What's the big deal with the seed? What'd he say? No big deal, amigo. But it sure seemed like he was planning a thing or making a big deal out of it. Why don't you let'em cool off? Mm, gotta get'em while they're hot. Let the moment pass, and you can't skin'em. You are learning the fine art of chili rellanos maybe a little too quickly. Ah. Cool off. Can I ask you something? I know it's none of my business. But how did you and Henry... Get married? Henry was sweet. He was charming and funny, a baseball player. He bounced around in the minors for a while waiting for his big break. One season he landed in Bakersfield where guess who was selling ball park peanuts? The day after our wedding night, Henry was playing ball with some of the guys after practice and he broke his knee, August 28. Henry had to give up baseball. And he blamed me. The sky. On my knees just thinkin' I cry, beggin' please. I don't wanna die so unlucky in love. It looks good. These rellanos were great. It took two. Ah, more wine, Senorita? Yes, please. Even if I can't pronounce the name of it? Where you going? I ah just gotta check on somethin'. At 3 in the morning? Whatever it is, don't get caught. Oh. Hey. Here's your paycheck. You know, I ah hear they make $20 now. Well, a bucks a buck, right? Yeah. Listen, um, take the rest of the afternoon off, OK? Well, good morning, Father. Morning. Um, where did this come from? It's the seed we planted yesterday. That's not possible is it? That's exactly what I was thinkin', but, hey. Hello Father. Morning Henry. I'll be darned. Oh, the name's Benny O'Malley. I ah work for the Father. Henry Mulhill. I've never seen you here before. Well, I've never seen you here before either, well, until yesterday. What? Oh, it's none of my business. No, no, no, te... tell me. I mean, why are you looking at me like that? Look, I know this is gonna sound crazy. But you just have this look like, I don't know, you lost somebody? Really? What do you know? Well, wait a second. Wait a second. Listen, I... I... I don't know. It just seems that you're so down in the dumps, I thought maybe I... I could lend ya an ear for a while. That's the problem with this cold and impersonal world is that strangers, they just don't talk to each other anymore. Frankly, I think that's tragic. Then again, I suppose some people prefer it that way. God took my wife away. Oh, I'm so sorry. May her soul rest in heaven. No, not like that. She left me. Oh. Why? Money. No money. Now, that's the true test of a commitment. So is having some. Well, money comes in and all of a sudden, everybody has to change. Mm-hm, the devil's calling card. Exactly. The more you bring in, the more cursed you are. Right. The important thing is, Henry, is to get your wife back before her heart wanders away and her body follows. It's not gonna be easy. I mean, before she left, um, it was, like, God hit her. But he used my hand. You know, Henry, if you want something bad enough, there are ways to get it back. Like how? Well, for instance, do something for the mission. If it has an need, fulfill it. I think at this time cost doesn't matter. Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Henry, listen, wouldn't it be great if we could all get something we wanted without having to give something up just to get it? The reality is you have to give to get. It's been nice talkin' to you. Woo. Hey. Woo. It's hot out. What? No work today? Nope. I'm takin' the day off. Yeah, me too. Really? Why not? Well, well, for dinner. Great. Oh. Dessert since you haven't been to the bar lately. It's 'cause ah I don't know to go there to see you. Now I don't hardly know her. But I think I could love her. Crimson and clover. Ah, when she comes walkin' over. Now I've been waitin' to show her. Crimson and clover. Over and over. Yeah. My, my such a sweet thing. I wanna do everything. What a beautiful feeling. Crimson and clover. Crimson and clover over and over. Crimson and clover over and over. Gonna shake some fancy change outta them cheap pendejos. I took a shower. There is one aroma that don't scrub off so easy. And honey, you got it. Wow. Whatever happened to you, I like it. So will your husband. What? You're going back to him. Hey Jesse. Hola. How you doin', Jesse? Oh, listen by the way, the ah padres at the mission think - you're doing a wonderful job. - Yeah? Yeah, you can copy me on that. Well, then ah here's to extra income all the best things in life. Turnin' down the streets of gold. I'm goin' down to the railroad tracks. And watch them lonesome boxcars... Excuse me. ...roll. Listen, Henry's playing hardball. You should go back to him. 'Cause I think he's gettin' ready to give something up. Money first, that was the deal, remember? He won't hit you anymore. Why didn't you tell me? I mean, you afraid I was gonna kill him? Well guess what? I almost did. But let me tell you something, vengeance is very bad for business. If you ever seen the cold, blue railroad tracks shinin' by the light of the moon. Go back to him. He'll make a donation, trust me. Or are you in no hurry to leave Jesse's? Is that what you're worried about? Are you sleeping with him? Don't be crazy. I'm gonna turn in early. Good night. Good night. Good night. You are sleeping with him. Jealousy is bad for business. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. You feel like heaven to touch. I wanna hold you so much. At long last love has arrived. And I thank God I'm alive. You're just too good to be true. Can't take my eyes off of you. I love you baby. And if it's quite all right. I need you baby now that I found you stay and let me love you baby. Let me love you baby. Let me love you. It's too soon to say so. It's too late not to say so. There's no other explanation. You think so? There's talk going around that there's something other than nature at work on that tree. Talk proves nothing. Talk doesn't have to prove anything. It's only a sign of what the people are thinking, right and or wrong. The people are prone to conjecture. So what's wrong with a little conjecture? N... no... W... wait, ah, if Benny has a point to make, I'd like to hear it. Whatever it is making that tree grow like it is, the talk that I hear suggests a renewed enthusiasm for the mission potentially. Which in turn may ah steer some revenues back into our coffers ah potentially? Potentially, yes. Oh, this is crazy. One little tree? Ah, the Archdiocese would first have to certify it as an extraordinary event. It's gonna take the church six months to figure out what the people already know. And believe me, they're not gonna wait that long. And neither is the Department of Building and Safety. Or do you gentlemen have a different plan to save the mission? Hey, Jesse. Put a fence around that goddamn tree, would ya? Father, this is such a risk. What if reality cannot support the people's perception? In dire, times, Father, distinction between perception and reality can get a bit um blurry. Blurry? Oh. Jesse, what happened? Why are you sittin' in the dark? I'm waiting for my boss to get home. What? Hope it doesn't take all your tip money to bankroll my new job. What are you talking about? Oh, you tell me. Why don't you tell me a little story? Why don't you start with the mission and what the hell is goin' on there, huh? What do you got me involved doing? Huh? And...and what are you and Benny after? Money. Money? My husband owes me a lot of money. Benny's just tryin' to help me get it, that's all. And the tree? It's for Henry, right? You know about the tree? I'm a gardener. I notice trees, especially when I help plant them. Jessie, I didn't mean to pull you into this. Well, who did? Benny? What else you two got going on? Nothing's going on. He's trying to help me, that's all. By fooling people? By messing with people's faith? You got the whole neighborhood taking the bait. It was only meant for Henry. And if somebody else gets hurt, oh well, well that's just the way life goes, right? You sonofabitch. Ugh. Who's idea was it to pull me in? Huh? Ah... you're gonna wake the neighbors up. Who's idea? You think I like working with a crowd? Come on. Well, you two should get your lies straight. Did you sleep with her? Did you? No. Did you? Yeah, I slept with her. Is this what it's come down to, huh, partner? You all outta sweetness and charm now? Come on, do it. Do it. Come on, do it. By the way, I quit my job. Jesse, Jesse, what's going on? What's all that noise? Father, you know the seed you blessed, the tree? Mm-hm. It's a hoax of Benny's doing. You think so? I know so. Why do you think he's done such a thing? Lust. Lust? For a woman. Any woman? No, not any woman. A woman you know? The mission's gonna to be shut down, Jesse. Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah. Attendance is down. And we've no money to continue. And God feeling great despair watching all this happen chooses a man, Benny. Well, why not Benny? Manifesting himself through Benny's able hands, God may be bringing this humble place a new vitality, a new hope, perhaps a new future. You know what, Jesse? This may be a miracle. Sweetheart, I'll be back in a second, OK? Morning Henry. Hey. Isn't that amazing? It sure is. I got somethin' for ya. Listen, why don't we ah go over there and talk, huh? What happened to your face? Hm, clumsy me, walked into a branch. Occupational hazards. I know all about that. Well, my donation to the mission. I mean, under normal circumstances, I'd wait two days until the 28th to do this but... Well, Henry, I'm sure God won't quibble with the date. A Triple-A Southern California Division Championship. I hit 0.318 on the year, including 38 consecutive games. I know that the sign said cash only. But you can get that appraised and auctioned off or you can just hang onto it and watch it multiply in value year after year after year after year. The guy's got six figures in the bank. And all's he can come up is a fucking swap meet ring. I'm not there so he has no cash. Guess I'm not good enough to go to the bank for. Yeah, well let me tell ya, I'd go to the bank for ya. You never know a man until he's been truly tested. Oh really? What are you doubting me? No, just right now I'm thinking about a three-day-old tree that's 4 feet tall that has everybody talkin'. We're two days away from the 28th. I've had it up to here with the trees. There was already probably about a dozen people there this morning. And I'll tell ya, if Jesse talks to Sanchez, we have some serious problems. Put the squeeze on this guy. Time to make lemonade out of lemons. The stew's getting cold. Um, angel, where were you staying? Henry, I'm staying with Cece. OK. Eat. Good? It's great. Good. What's all this stuff about a miracle? There's this little tree at the mission. And Father Sanchez blessed the seed, I saw him. You can practically watch it grow. It's incredible. I don't believe in miracles. But you're here. Angel, you came back. You... you came back. Eat it. Why not? Why not? I don't know, Henry. That's between you and God. Hello? Four? Yeah, got it. OK. Bye. Who was that? Ah, Jesse, I gotta go get some fertilizer. Um, let's do something later, OK, maybe even with our clothes on. See ya later. Hello Henry. What's up? Nothing. Nothing on a beautiful day like this? My wife came back. Well, well, am I... am I missing something here? I mean, I thought you wanted your wife back, didn't you? Yes, I did. So what's the problem, Henry? You know, I made a mistake talking to you about all this. Hey, you know, this is not the same man who 0.312 for 36 consecutive games, who led Bakersfield to a 75-29 championship season. God, Henry, that must have took some kind of determination. Man, you were the best. Since my ah... my wife came back, she ah... she... she won't ah- She won't ah... She won't, no she won't. Oh, well, that's a shame, Henry. That's a shame. A man isn't a man unless his wife is his wife, do you know what I mean? Mm-hm, yeah, yeah. Henry, have you seen this? Hm, let me tell you something, yesterday you gave something that meant a lot to you. And you got back your wife. But, Henry what meant a lot to you maybe didn't really help God with his certain problems He has at the mission. Maybe He's waiting for a more substantial demonstration of your faith. Substantial? Mm-hm. I mean, whoever invented money, I... I could... personally I could kill them with all the... the temptations and the frustration, and... dammit, Henry, we're gonna lose the. Mission and we were just about to embark on a... a miracle. And... and you can just sit here and think about sex? It's not that simple. Think about it, Henry. Who's your friend? Hey, baby. What are you doin' here? Ah, just a guy I know. Just a guy you know? Mm-hm. Does he have a name? Henry Mulhill maybe. You playin' dumb with me, Benny? No. I think that it's time that you told me what's goin' on with you and Tanya and Henry and Jesse and the mission and me. And if I left anyone or anything out, I would like to know about that too. Sweetheart, there is nothing going on. You are lying. Baby, I'm not lying to you. Are you waiting for Tanya to leave her loco husband? Oh, Jesus Christ. Is she the one you really want? I'm just a patsy, right? I took you in because you had no place. And you used me, like, you lick the sugar off a donut and you throw it away. OK, can I just explain to you. Save it, cavrone. You don't need to go buy no manure. Because you're already full of it. Ah, and this? You could give it back to whoever you stole it from. Ah, shit. I need to talk to you. Please? Save it. I'm not being mixed up in your mess. I need your help with Benny. I don't know what to do. You're on your own with him, whatever you two got goin' on. - Business. - Yeah? That's not what he told me. Hey, Jesse, you in there? It's me. - What's this? Part of the plan? I don't want him to know I'm here. Jesse? Please. Closet. It's Benny. Ah, first, I'd like to say peace. And also, I come with a friendly little proposition. Save it. I understand how you, feel truly I do. May I come in? Look, man, it's like this. When Tanya asked me to help her get the money from Henry, I just... I... I couldn't say no. She told me not to tell anyone, even you, especially you. But I figured since you knew everything already, you might be interested in a little piece of the action. Let me ask you something. Between Tanya and the money, which is more important to you? Well, come on, the money, of course. Jesse, I'm talking about more money by tomorrow than you'll make in 1,000 years pulling weeds. Mm-hm. So ah what do you want me to do? All's you gotta do is meet me at the train station at 5 o'clock, the cafe. What do you say, pal? We got a deal? You'll know if I'm there. OK, fair enough. Oh, by the way, ah, I wasn't here. Where? You weren't... that's a good one. Well, looks like your relationship with Benny is a little short in the trust department. Yeah. Yeah. Count me in. Bless you. You comin' to the pow-wow? Who's gonna meet him? Don't we first need to know if he's really got the money? Has he been to the bank yet? I don't know. What do you know? I have no idea. Well, what if he doesn't have the money? Let's assume he does. Let's, ah, take the chance that he does have the money. Are you planting another tree? Oh, for Christ sakes. Are you kidding me? The last one nearly broke my back. Here's what we're gonna do. At 7:00 AM, I'm gonna meet Henry at the mission right before Father Sanchez and the rest come out. He's gonna give me the money. We'll meet here a 7:20. We'll split the money three ways. Then we'll go our merry ways. We'll separate, get outta town. I might make a suggestion that we don't show our faces for at least a year. So you're gonna meet Henry by yourself? Well, I don't think it'd be very smart to take Tanya with me, do you? So we wait at the station for you to show up with the money? Yes. What's the matter, Jesse? You think I'm gonna stand you up? I don't know, would you? Would you feel more comfortable if you came with me to the mission? Why don't we all go to the mission? We'll have a regular tea party. It's not gonna matter with all those people there. Henry and Sanchez are not gonna notice a thing. Well, we'll make banners. We'll shoot fireworks. Jesse and I'll wait at the station. We're all gamblers, aren't we? Gracias. Oh, man, do we make a good lookin' couple. OK, listen to me carefully. At 7:15 you're going to meet me at the west end of the railroad bridge. At 7:25, a freight train comes through. Me, you, and 130 grand are gonna get on that train. When we get to Mojave, we're gonna buy ourselves a little car. And then we're gonna drive to the end of the world, baby. What about Jesse? That's what I say. What about Jesse? Jesse can go to the station as planned. He can meet with himself. OK? I'll see you later, OK? Listen, I... I just wanted to let you know that I don't want the money. It's not what I want. You're not gonna trust him, are you? It would be crazy for all of us to go up there. Spend it wisely. Ah. Oh. Ow. Mm. Hola Henry. Yeah, I remember you. You work at the bar. Very good. What brings you out so early? I'm ah... I'm on my way to the mission. I mean, you've heard about the... The tree? It's amazing what a man'll do to get his hands on a woman's body, especially your wife's. I'm sorry. What did you say? Ask Benny. He knows what I'm talkin' about. Wait a minute. I didn't get that. Motherfuckin' bus never comes on time. Shit, comes on time. Now that's would be a miracle. Due to depart at 7:40 for Santa Clarita and Lancaster will now depart at 8:05 on track three. That's 8:05 on track three. Tanya Mulhill to baggage check please. Tanya Mulhill to baggage check. Morning Henry. Morning. Listen um, let's go to the back gate. Le... let... let's get away from these people, OK? If I ask you a question, will you tell me the truth? Have I ever not told you the truth, Henry? Does this have anything to do with you and my wife? No, Henry. It has to do with you and your wife. Long live the mission. Ah, huh. Oh. What is this? What is this? What are you're tryin' to pull with me? I don't... I... I don't know. What are you tryin' to do? Where's my damn money? The tree. The money. My wife. Tell me where the money is you sonofabitch. Tell me. It's been a while since I drove. Agh. Agh. Henry. Agh. You're leg, Henry. Your leg, man. Runnin' with... without your cane. Woo. Woo. Where's Tanya? I gotta tell Tanya. Ask Jesse. OK. OK. Whoo. Are you going to the mission with that? Where else. Nice car. Thanks. Ah, will you do me a favor? Could you give this to Father Sanchez? Sure. Jesse. Where's my wife? Oh, shit. Jesse. Where's Tanya? Wait. Wait. Jesse, stop. Oh. Jesse. Jesse. Wait. Wait. Wait. Mister you wanna play? Jesse. Watch out. Nice catch Mister. You're out. Father, look at this, more. Oh my God. Our parishioners. Oh, What's this? $50. Oh, my God. Oh my God. $100. Oh, God bless those parishioners. Oh, look, look at this. Dios mio. Look. My donation to the miracle tree fund, $65,000. H. Mulhill. Henry Mulhill? Hey stranger. Need a ride? Benny, Benny, what happened to you? Are you all right? - I'm fine. Benny, are you sure you're OK? Benny, you... you have blood all over your face. Benny, have you seen the tree? Benny, have you seen the tree? Yes, I've seen the tree. No, Benny, have you seen the tree today? Today Benny. - Today? Yes, today, Benny, today. No. - Oh, well come on. - We'll show you. Hey what happened to him? He's bleeding. - Hey, that's him? - Who? Him. In a little cafe just the other side of the border. She was sittin' there and givin' me looks that made my mouth water. So I started walking her way. She belonged to that man Jose. Then I knew, yes, I knew I should leave when I heard her say. Come a little bit closer. You're my kind of man, so big and so strong. Come a little bit closer. I'm all alone and the night is so long. So we started to dance in my arms she felt so inviting. And I just couldn't resist but just one little kiss so exciting. Then I heard the guitar player say, vamos, Jose's on his way. Then I knew, yes, I knew I should run. Then I heard her say. Come a little bit closer you're my kind of man so big and so strong. Come a little bit closer I'm all alone and the night is so long. Then the music stopped. When I looked the cafe was empty. Then I heard Jose say, man, you know you're in trouble plenty. So I dropped my drink from my hand. And through the window I ran. And I rolled away I could hear her say to Jose. Come a little bit closer you're my kind of man. So big and so strong. Come a little bit closer, I'm all alone and the night is so long. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
