--== McEphie ==-- Good afternoon, ma'am. Hey. Oh, buddy. Unit 301 is requesting a new key. Broke theirs. Second time now. So annoying. Also, could you replace the lightbulbs on the third floor? It's gone out again. And Unit 405 is asking for repairs. Their sink is clogged again. Again? Yeah. Oh and also- Yeah? The couple in 205? Looks like they're about to split up. Why? What happened? They didn't come in together this time. Keep an eye out later. If you see only one of them come in first, you'll know. And earlier, the tenant in Unit 206... the gay one. Middle of the day, he invited me to his unit! If I were you, I'd go for it. I think I can wait. I still have gas money. Bud, let me know tomorrow, okay? About the couple. By the way, bud. Any news about anyone who could fill in for me? Even for just two days. Goddamn, it's been two months since I've had a day off. Man, welcome to the club. My wife's not crazy about it either. This guy I worked with at the mall? He's working at an online casino. He's taking on both day and night shifts. Three months, no day off. His wife's at his throat, too. Suspects he's cheating on her. What do they know? Being a security guard isn't easy. See ya. Take care. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Right on time, Mr. CC. Good luck with your calls tonight. Oh. Time for a walk, doggy. Take care, Ms. D. Hello, Mr. B. How's the garbage? Ma'am S. I heard it's not too good with sir. Is it stressful? I hope you two work it out. Hey, bud. Is this complete? Yeah. All there. Good. Well? Any news about the couple? Did they break up? Yeah, you were right. But they still live together. It's only a matter of time. You know, that's the problem when you're married and you both have jobs. Too complicated. Puts all sorts of ideas in your head. Look at me and my wife. I just made her stay home and sell pickled papayas online. Not always. Look at me and Amor. Amor is too good. You just got lucky. Nah, it just depends on the couple. And it's normal for couples to help each other out. In this economy? Good morning, Ma'am. Sir. Come on, love. It's been two months. I don't even get rest days. You should just switch to another agency. I keep telling you that. What? You'll come home and I'll leave? Love. It's not that simple. Whatever. When you wake up, eat the fish first, okay? That goes bad faster. Love. What? Do you love me? Really? Yeah. Take me to work. What about me? Do you love me? Yeah. Really? Yeah! Love, - I already showered. - Last one. I'm running late. Last one. Promise. Okay. That's enough. Alright. Love you. Love you. Come on, you'll gonna be late. Take me to work. Yeah, I'm done. Bud, someone just moved in to 422. Hot as hell! Looks wild. Red hair! But it looks like she's got a sugar daddy. See you. Tell me something next time. You're too slick. Bastard. Take care, bud. Sugar daddy. Hi, Ms. F. Jimmy. Motherfucker's late again. Bud, where are you? I'm on my way, bud. Fuck you. You're late again. I wanna go home. I'm sorry bud. I still have hangover. But in 15 minutes, I'll arrive. Whatever, just hurry up. I'll wait. All you do is drink. Hey, that's not true! Alright, bye! Look at the time... Buddy. What? Confirmed. Sugar daddy. They came in together earlier. What time? Around 5:15. But the sugar daddy left. Right before you came in. Also, there's bad news. The married couple, they broke up! The man is gone. That's a shame. That woman is nice. The gay tenant 206, says he usually hears the man shouting. So that's why. It's really up to the man. The man leads the relationship. See you. Ma'am. Do you need help? Ah, ma'am. I hope you're okay. Love, what do you want to eat later? So I can prepare it. Love, if there's some fish, just fry one for me. Okay? Love you. - I love you too. - Thanks. Take care. Buddy! The heck are you up to? I lost a hundred. If you see it, you can have it. See you. I can't smell anything, sir. There's still some there, miss. Maybe it's one of those. Just keep looking. It's not here. My God, sir. At least know what brand it is. I'm not a fortune teller! Mister, stop! Miss. Well... I'm a little lost. How can I get to San Nicolas? Sir, there are jeeps that literally say "San Nicolas". Just get on one of them. Ah. How much is the fare? It's 9.50. Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Miss. Last question. What's your perfume? It smells really good. I wanna give it to my wife as a present. Excelsia. Thanks, miss. Volume Three. Excelsia Volume Three. Thanks, miss. - Bud. - Hey bud. Sorry, I'm gonna be late. Stomach problems. It's okay bud, I'll wait for you. - Thanks. - Alright, bud. - Go ahead bud. - Bye! Is it perfect, sir? Perfect. Hey. Hey. Hey. Ma'am. My sink is clogged. Do you know anyone who could fix it? - I don't know anyone in the area. - Me. I can fix it. You can fix my sink? Yes. I can fix the- the sink. Alright. Unit 422. Good evening, ma'am. Hey, is it done? Yes ma'am. It's done. Ma'am, could I use your bathroom? Shit, shit... Shit, shit... Think, Jimmy. Think. Think. Yeah. Oh my God. I want that. Have you eaten? Oh my God. I love it. Thanks, hon. Just take care, okay? Yeah. Okay. Not a problem. - Alright, wait a sec. - All good, ma'am. Thank you. Sorry, hon. What was that? Good evening, sir. Good morning, love. Money's missing. Did you take some? Love, - I was saving that - for air conditioning. So you'll sleep better in the day time. Oh... Sorry, love. I've been meaning to give you this for a while. But I couldn't. I wanted to surprise you. Love! This is expensive! This is what Macy uses. This is really popular! Thank you, love! Thank you, love! Thank you! You look like you're in a good mood. Red hair was just here. Looks like a rest day. She says there's a leaky pipe in her bathroom. It seems like... she's doesn't wear bras. Lord! I don't wanna sin. Good morning, Ma'am. Going to work? Are you the guy who fixed my sink? Ah, you're in the night shift. I'm Jimmy. If you need anything, just text me. I gave you my number. When I fixed your sink. - Hey. - Hey. You're intense, bud. Too secretive. Don't sneak up on me, man. Boss. Jimmy, I found someone to cover for you later. Take a rest day. Huh? Haven't you been asking for a day off? You haven't had a rest day for a while right? - Alright, boss. - Okay. Yay, love! We can finally go on a date! Yeah. Yay, love! There. This is it, love. This is the really good coffee my friend was telling me about. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't buy any of this. That's worth one and a half kilos of rice. We got two. That's worth five kilos. And the bread? That's worth seven. What a downer. It's not like we do this every day, love. Love, It's expensive. Love you. You know, expensive coffee suits you. Yeah? Because for me, you're worth much more. Let's check in later. Roman told me there's one nearby. The bed? It's in a car. And there's one in a train. - Huh? - Want to go there? Do they have an airplane? It's like a theme park. We'll know later. Okay. Come on. The coffee. Well? So? Goddamn, this is too fancy. Delicious. I told you. The coffee here is good. Wait, love. Excuse me for a sec. I'll be quick. Night on the town, huh? Cotton candy. Cotton candy. Hey, boy. - How much is that? - 25. 25? That's a lot. Love, want roses? Yeah! Give me three. Love you. Thank you, love. Let's have a photo. Okay. Alright. You're so pretty. You're cuter in that. Mama called me yesterday. She says we should visit her in Cabiao. Love, even just once a year. Love. Do you think that if we didn't leave Cabiao- we'd have a better life now? Love. Are you having a hard time? We've only been here for three years. Of course it's not easy. And if we never left that place... maybe we'll still have mud on our feet. There isn't mud here, love. But sometimes I feel like- the people here look down on us. That we're just provincial folk forcing ourselves into the city. We're either cashiers, or factory workers. Working in construction. Or security guards. At least, we're fighting fair. We're not hurting anyone. We don't steal. We have more decent jobs than others. Don't let go, okay love? Wait, love. It's my boss. Wait, let me get this. Boss. Hello Jimmy. Roman got into an accident. What? On his motorbike. Drunk, probably. He's in the hospital. - He had a fractured leg. - How is he, boss? He's okay. Just needs to recover for three months Jimmy. I'm putting you in the day shift, okay? Boss. Day shift? Sorry, I can't find a replacement. Come on, boss. It's not easy to adjust my body clock. I can't do anything about it. Don't you want to? Boss. Jimmy, you'll start tomorrow. Day shift. Boss. Tomorrow already? Don't you want to? Okay, boss. I'll come in tomorrow. Bye. Love. Is there a problem? Roman got into an accident. Oh? I'm filling in for him. Day shift. Day shift? Yeah. Yay, love! We'll have the same schedule. And I could drop by in the afternoon, so we could go home together. What do you think, love? Love. I have more good news. Really? Yeah. Two months. I'm gonna be a father? Really? - I'm gonna be a mother! - Yes! We'll finally be complete, love! Bud. - Hey. - Jimmy? I'm Paulito. Do you have any requests? Not much. Ah, but... Is the gay guy upstairs really that fussy? Yeah, they're just like that. But tips really well. Ah, ma'am. - Oh? - Good morning. - Good morning, Jimmy. - You're blooming today. You're in the day shift now? Yes. Oh. Let's go home? Bud, I'm going. Hey, take care. I think these are my pregnancy cravings, love. Love, it's too early. Mama said it'll take about four to five months before they start moving. And then we could find out if it's a boy or a girl. What do you want it to be? I hope it's a girl. I hope it's a boy. If it's a boy... Yeah? Frederic James. - Good choice. - And if it's a girl? Well... Angeli Rose. Angel. Angeli. It's beautiful, love. Angeli. Love, Mama told me something. She said that when the baby comes... What? We should think about going back to Cabiao. She said the earnings from the farm is okay. What if... I worked abroad? I can do it. I could take a vocational course. While working as a guard. Can you do it? It's not easy, love. Of course. For the baby. And it's probably best if they grow up in the province. So I'll be working abroad. So we could buy our own house in Cabiao. Our dream house. And maybe put up a small business. For the baby's future. And they'll go to school there. We should get a big house. Then if another comes, we'll still have room. Right? I love you so much. Me too. I love you too. I'll take care of you. Don't worry. Okay? Oh! Ma'am. Hi Jimmy. - Yes, ma'am. - Are you busy? No, not really. - Why? - Ah, perfect! It's Rebecca's birthday. Come over to my place, okay? I cooked some soup. Come on. No thanks, ma'am. I'm still full. - Thanks. - Ice cream. Do you want some ice cream? - No, no. It's okay. - It's kinda hot today. Booze! Come, - let's have some shots. - No, no please. No, it's okay. - You don't want any? - Sorry, I'm still on duty. You know, this is why I don't like you. You're such a party pooper. Let's go, Rebecca. Hello? Jimmy? - Yes, who is thi... - Are you on duty? Ma'am? I'm from unit 422. Yes, I'm on duty. What is it? The lightbulb in my living room is blown. Do you have a spare? Lightbulb. Yes, yes. I do. I have one. Jim. Ma'am. Is he there? Yes, hon. Come in. Hi, hon. How's work? Okay. How did your shopping go? It was okay. I really liked it. Okay. Need anything else? Nothing, for now. Well... Maybe next time. Ma'am. It's done. Wait a sec. Ma'am, do you go to that coffee shop often? Huh? What coffee shop? The one in town. Ah. Did I see you there last time? I was there with my team members. We had a meeting there, hon. Okay. Alright. Payment. Thank you, ma'am. Sir. Thank you. Hon! You forgot something again, didn't you? Did you forget something too, Jimmy? I was asking for a key replacement. I think I lost mine. Take care of your keys. Or we'll get break-ins from perverts. Yes, hon. Come on. Let's get your organizer. Are you alone? Can you come over? Wait for me. Ah, ma'am. Is there something wrong? You can tell me. Lock the door when you leave. Okay. Oh, love. How are the savings? Enough for air conditioning? Another month and it's good. Love? What? Did you leave last night? Huh? I don't know if I was dreaming, or not but... I could have sworn you left last night. You must have been dreaming. I slept like a log. Ma'am. Sir. Good morning. Good morning, Jimmy. Good morning, ma'am. Ma'am. Need something? No. I just wanted to ask how you're doing. Ah. About last night? Forget about it. Consider it a favor. Don't expect for another one. Ma'am, I never said anything like that. Isn't that what you really wanted? For a long time? Are you happy yet? What about the guy in the coffee shop? Was that a favor too? Why? Who are you? Aren't you just a security guard? How many tenants have you fucked? Ma'am, I'm not like that. Stop bothering me. I mean, look at you. You're only good for sex. Love? Macy. Oh, Jimmy. Did Amor come in today? Yeah, she did. She left at about five. Is there a problem? Ah, no. Nothing. Thanks. Hello? Ah, hello. Is this Jimmy Canaria? Yes, that's me. Who is this? I'm calling from Sta. Cruz General Hospital. Do you know Amor Ferea? Yes, she's my wife. Why? What happened? She's here at the hospital. You need to go here. What? Our baby... Our baby's gone... Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone, love. Sorry. Love. Hush now. Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone. Our baby's gone. Gone... my baby. Our baby's gone, love. Hush now. It's okay. Jimmy? Jimmy? Ma'am. Is everything alright? There's money missing from my drawer. I just noticed. Rebecca and I just went out of town. On her birthday. And when we came back, I saw that there's money missing! Well ma'am, maybe you just misplaced it. Oh, no! I have a gut feeling that it was my ex. He's the only one who has a key to my apartment. Really? Do you want to check? Yeah. When was it? Two days ago. Two days. There! That's it! Skip forward to around 10 PM. There! That son of a bitch! Do you see that? There! The nerve of that guy. Look at that motherfucker. The audacity! Fuck! I want to strangle him! He even left 300. Do you want me to give you a copy? Ah. No, it's okay. Thanks, Jimmy boy. Excuse me for a sec. Love. I cooked you dinner. Eat up, okay? I'm just... I'm not really feeling well. Three days, they said. I can go back to work by then. I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry, love. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm really sorry. Sorry, love. Sorry. My god! But yeah, that guy was... he was funny, right? I know, right? And his voice was kinda... What was that? No, it's like- His face back there, where he was reacting to... What do you want for dinner? I'll get some takeout. Up to you, hon. Okay. Anything. Bye, hon. Bye! Ma'am. Jimmy. How did you... How did you survive it all? You really know every one of us here, don't you? Is something wrong? I saw how you were happy. I saw how you were sad. And now- I saw how you endured it all- Everything. With everything I did to her. I don't know if I can... I don't know how I can even face her. My dear. We have different stories. We're going through different things. But in the end, only one thing matters. Remember why you chose her in the first place. Remember- why you love her. That's how you know what really matters. And what you should be fighting for. What if I really hurt her? You know, Jimmy. It's not everyday- that we meet someone who will always be there. To listen and understand. So whoever that person is for you, take care of her. And then when you're ready. When you can do that. They'll know- if they love you. Thank you. You can do it. Amor, I'm heading out first. My sister is waiting for me. Okay, take care. Look to your left. I mean, right. Last one. Behind you. It's okay if you want nothing to do with me. I understand. Sorry. You don't deserve this. I don't deserve you. But- If if there's any chance? If you want to try. I just thought- I thought you were serious about our plans. I can't even begin to understand. I don't know what- What I'm missing. Where did I- Where did I go wrong? Love. You did nothing wrong. Maybe because- You thought that- If I found out, I would just forgive you. So it should be fine, right? It's okay because you know that I love you so much. I'm a woman, Jimmy. Do you even know what that means? I'm a woman! By all rights, you should be in jail but I don't want that, because I love you so much! We lost our baby because of you! Do you understand? It's because of you! I'm just so angry... But- but I still love you, Jimmy! I keep holding on to you but- But you! You let go. You let go! I love you, you know? I love you. I love you. I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! Love. Well. Back to reality. That's enough sleep, Roman. How's Amor? How are you? Hey, just between you and me. Man to man. You know I can't figure you out. How could you do that to your wife? Amor is really kind. I don't know, bud. I thought it would be okay. Now you know why, I don't pay no mind to others. I'm fine with just stealing glances. You know. Even if I am who I am. I can look directly into my wife's eyes. No secrets. No nothing. That's what's important, buddy. Just because we're men, it doesn't mean we're superior in everything. Even in heart or guts. Being a man is a responsibility. Well, bud? You're in charge here now. Alright. Let me know if you do go to Bahrain. Thanks. Jimmy, you still there? I need you to do something. What do you need me to fix, ma'am? We're done. The guy you saw at the coffee shop? That was my husband. Frankie was the one who helped me survive. I'm sorry. I know I offended you. That was just a really bad day. The night that it happened. Frankie and I were having problems. I just needed someone. You know, Jimmy. I'm not a bad person. I just needed someone to be with. And you were there. You helped me. Now, I want to return the favor. Today's my last day. Don't contact me anymore, I'm changing my number. And I'm not just a guard. I'm a security guard, ma'am. I'm not only good for sex. I'm also capable of love. True love. Hello. Ma'am Amor? Yes? Delivery for you, I'm downstairs. What? For me? Yes Ma'am. - Yes, just a sec. - Thank you. - Is this for me? - Yes. - Who is it from? - Ma'am, it just says "SG". Okay, thanks. You're so pretty. You're cuter there. There. Is that ripe? What about this one? Look at you, you picked a lot already. Soup! Mama's soup. Go on, eat up. Ah, love. Soup? Ma. Any news about Aling Marta's lot? Just one more work trip and I can buy it. Oh dear, no. I know nothing about that. Just ask your father. Oh. It's okay, dear. Although, isn't it a bit too big? It's okay, Pa. I just need to work some more and I can pay for it. That's why I'm only asking for a month's break. My dear. Don't exert yourself. You father and I can still work. Just relax. Take as much time as you need before you go back to Dubai, okay? Mama, it's okay. I'm still young. I can still do it. It's better that we have good investments. Come on, eat up. Dear. Any news on Jimmy? I heard he had a house built for his grandmother. That he has a good life now. He also has an eggplant and papaya farm. And still no wife. Let her be, Sylvia. You're such a gossip. Don't meddle with your daughter with such things. What's wrong with that? - I'm just letting her know. - Unbelievable. - I was just saying. - Why don't you just eat? Same prices, okay? Of course, Raul. The sales are good... - Thanks. - In all of the products. Can't you lower the deductions? Sorry Sylvia, I can't. Bec... We'd be at a loss, with gas money. - Okay, okay. - Thank you. - Hey. - There. No, I'll do it, pa. - I can do it. - Wow! - I can do it. - Our daughter is strong. Pa, you should start. Start planting seedlings for tomatoes and cucumbers. How are you? I heard you wanted to buy Marta's lot. But I beat you to it. I'm planning to build our dream house there. We've been through a lot, Amor. Maybe back then- I wasn't ready. I wasn't strong enough. Three years, Jimmy. We started here. This is where you said yes. Do you remember? We had a tenant back then. She said... She told me to remember why I loved you in the first place. So that I'll know what really matters. What I should be fighting for. Since then, I didn't let go. Even now, it's still you. Why did you love me, Jimmy? I loved you... Because you're the one one I want to be with rest of my life. If you can accept me. If you want to try. I hope... I wish...
