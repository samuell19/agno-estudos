The only running I'm doing is for cheeseburgers and donuts. - What? - We gotta ease into this! - Man, nobody easing into nothing, alright? You over here running around, right? Feeling like you pregnant, and you look pregnant, and then--man, what is that? You're eating the wrong food, that's your main problem! - It's just a snack. - Ain't no snack. - Listen. The girls in the 'Wood like men with a little meat on their bones, not like those Santa Monica types. What's her name? Jomanda? - Man, Jasmine. - [laughing] - [laughs] - WALLY: How's that going? - Not good. - Well, give it up, she's out of your league. She's probably in one of those big houses in the Palisades, dating one of them rich actors. You're broke. Until Terry hits the NBA, you ain't got nothing going for ya. Move on! - Yeah, appreciate that, Wally. Making me feel a whole lot worse. - WALLY: That's what I'm here for, man. - KEVIN: Yeah, you asshole. - [laughing] Listen, seriously. What you guys did to her back then... even if she never speaks to you again, at least you got to say your piece, and now you can move on. - Thanks, man. Yeah, thanks. Like, I feel a lot better, man. - Me too. - KEVIN: Yeah. - This is my kids' lunch. Let's get a burger. - Wooh, definitely, 'cause I am definitely starving. Let's go, you're gonna drive. [laughs] - [groans] - KEVIN: I know that. I know that, we're not doing that. I'm not doing that. - [groaning] Spasms. - I'm not doing that, Wally. - Oh, it's moving! It's going down the leg! Oh, God, help me up. Help me up, help me up. - Come on, man. You're too lazy, dude. - [grunts] - Come on, I can't-- - [groans] - Come on, Wally, get up! - [groaning] - - Did I ever tell you that when I was a kid, all I wanted to do was sing? - I didn't know that. Learn something new every day. - And one day, I just stopped. Didn't love it anymore. But for some reason, I was thinking about it the other day and realized that... it's not because I didn't love singing, but... that I associated it with all these horrible things that were happening at the same time. - Or, it's called accepting reality, growing up. I mean, what's the chances you would've made it anyway? Gotta stop living in the past. Gotta go. - [door opens, shuts] - Heck is wrong with this dang thing? Alright, here we go-- Hey. - Hey. - Yeah, I was, uh, no use inside. - Hmm. - While he was getting his ankle rehabbed, came out here. - Guess that could get kind of weird. - I know, right? - I told you you don't have to come to all of his sessions, he's in good hands, I promise. - Well, I'm very hands-on. Especially with my first client. - Well, it's a beautiful day and I'm going out for a walk. Care to join me? - [exhales] Okay. - Hmm. This way. [chuckles] - It's just weird how we ran into each other. - Weird? - Yeah. - Dude, I was in shock. - Hmm. So, how--how long have you been here? - Hmm, about a year and a half. I came back but briefly about four years ago when Aunt Addis passed. ♪ - Sorry to hear that. - I know. She was so sweet. - I remember her. - Yeah, she'd been sick for a long time, so. - Huh. - After that I didn't have a reason to come back until my husband got an executive position with Bank of America and... we chose to come here. - Husband? - Hmm. Five years. Then one of his high-profile clients needed a physical therapist for his office and... I got the gig, ha-ha. Thank you very much. - Congratulations. - Appreciate that. Mm-hmm. So, what's up with you, you married? - Was engaged but it didn't work out. - Sorry to hear that. - No big deal. - So I've been trying to figure this out, are you a sports agent for basketball, football, baseball, soccer, what you doing? [laughs] - I actually wouldn't say all that, you know, I kinda got thrown into my situation. - Ah. Got it. - Yeah, um, got my first client. - Ooh, bravo to you. - After college, I... played Canadian football for five years, and then I started coaching and... - Wow. [laughs] - Here I am. [chuckles] - Okay, that's some journey, Kev. - Yeah, well, the best part of the journey is, what can I say? Being on the West Coast. - Ah. - 'Cause... the East Coast weather... - I hate snow. - Yeah. - I like to hibernate in the wintertime. - You can love it sometimes, it all depends. - [chuckles] Yeah, everything depends. - [laughs] - It's beautiful. - Yeah. [clicks tongue] - [laughs] Wow. - It's nice. - It's very nice. - [laughing] - I mean, it was nice, but it was kind of weird, 'cause it was like being in high school again. - [humming] - Aw, that's sweet. - Very sweet. - Okay. - Very sweet. - He's a sports agent. - He's a sports agent, yes. - Is he single? - He's off the market, Briana. - Oh, bummer. - [giggling] - Here you go, ladies. - Oh, my. My, my, my, my. Hmm. I'm next. [clears throat] Thank you, darling. - And the cookies will be done in ten. - SONYA: Thank you, baby. - Anything for you. - JASMINE: Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm! What you been doing, Sonya?! - Where did you find him?! - My gosh, I was sittin' here thinking the same thing, what's up? - You know, he is a keeper, isn't he? - JASMINE: Girl. - A girl at work introduced us, and get this. - JASMINE: Mm-hmm. - He's studying to become a pastor. - Okay, okay, so he wanna be a pastor. - SONYA: Mm-hmm. - Have you been to the mountaintop?! [screams, laughs] - [laughing] - Have you been? - SONYA: [laughing] - Okay, yeah, uh, how are things working in the sex department? - Um, you know what? We're working on that. You know, I'm still breaking him in. - Breaking him in or breaking him also? - BRIANA: [laughs] - [teasing laugh] - Hey! [laughing] Okay, okay, well, how long have you known him? And why haven't you told us about him? You tell us about every other guy. - 'Cause I didn't wanna jinx it, and you know you talk too much. - Hmm, you do talk too much, Bri. - We've been taking it slow, he's a keeper, we only just now started discussing, like, being exclusive. - Okay, I respect that. - It's only been nine months. - [coughs] And no sex?! Oh, no! - Is that all you think about? - Uh, yes! - Sonya. Girl-- - Stop it. He wants to do things God's way, okay? He wants to develop a more emotional, spiritual connection first. - Mm-mm, he gotta go. - Girl, you better make some contact. Connection, contact. - Yeah, test it out. - And you know what? That's why you're single. - But I'm relaxed. - Single. - Mm. This is so good. - Ah. So. Tell me about your husband. - BOTH: [laughing] - Besides the obvious successful businessman. - Well, there isn't much to say. Not good anyway. [laughs] - Wow. - Are we really gonna do this? - Yes. Really are. - Well, after my mom died, on the same day that what happened between us happened, I was...very messed up. I knew there was no way that I could survive that kind of pain again, so I closed myself off to pretty much everyone, buried myself in work, and did my damndest to succeed at everything I could to make Daddy happy again. But in the process, I lost myself. Could never quite reconnect with that positive dreamer I used to be. Kevin, do you remember how much I loved music and singing? - I sure do. [chuckles] - Well, I just found out the other day that my husband had no idea. - What? - Yeah, he had no idea and he also didn't care. - What? Like, where did this come from? - I don't know, but come on, I knew the man I was marrying. You know, Robert is the kind of guy who loves a challenge. And for years I think he saw me as some sort of mystery. I don't know, figure out how to crack the code and get beneath the surface, and I never let him in. He gave up and now we're more like...roommates than husband and wife. - Mm-mm-mm. Roommates? - Mm-hmm. - [laughs] - Yeah, if I'm gonna compare it to something, I would say were're roommates, and-- - That's funny. - That's very pathetic. - You good with me. You good. That's... [laughs] Wow. [laughs] - Oh, my gosh! Okay, enough of my drama. What's yours? What's--what's up with you? - Oh. Mine? - Mm-hmm. - Well. Me and Gabrielle, we--we met in Toronto after one of my games and... everything was great with us. And me, you know? Until the injuries started piling up and then, finally, after five average seasons, I was like, "I'm done with this. I'm done," you know? And I give her some credit, you know, she tried to stick about while I dibbled and dabbled into the coaching thing, but that wasn't her thing, so... mm, she started sneaking around with one of my former teammates. [chuckles] - What a cunt. - Yeah. - [laughs] - Big one. - And I'm not sorry I said that. - Oh, it's all good. It's all good. The good thing is... me and you talking again. - This is kinda nice, isn't it? [laughs] Oh, do you remember after school, how we'd meet at the park and we'd sit on the bench and you would tell me about your day and I would tell you about mine. - My days was never good. - [laughing] - Well, mine sucked 'cause everybody teased me. - No, it's okay. We was kids, you know. - Why are kids so mean? - No filters. - [laughing] - Right? - Filters? - No filter, they just go. Just go with the flow. - [laughs] Hmm. - Hey, um... - Hmm? [chuckles] - [chuckles] - I'm sorry about that.

Mama you was quiet the whole trip, what's wrong? - You don't wanna hear what I have to say. - It's about Jasmine. What is it? Hmm? - What you're doing is wrong. - What I'm doing is wrong? Because we still care for each other? - Because she's still someone else's wife. Until that changes on paper... it's wrong, it's a sin. I raised you better than this. - [phone ringing] - Look, Mama, you--you just don't understand. - What are yout talking about, boy? She's a married woman.
