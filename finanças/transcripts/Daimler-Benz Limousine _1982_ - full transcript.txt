TOR FILM STUDIO PRESENTS DAIMLER-BENZ LIMOUSINE STARRING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF AND A GUEST APPEARANCE BY MUSIC EDITING PRODUCTION MANAGER CINEMATOGRAPHY WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY POZNAŃ, MAY 5, 1939 You’re out of shape. You must exercise more. Daimler-Benz. Kaiser Wilhelm. Adolf Hitler. Now? Now! -Just a sec. -We’ll be late. - We’ll make it? - We will. Why not a bridge or a tunnel? As minister Ciano said to ambassador Wieniawa. Professor, he’s bleeding. Take him out. A tunnel? Yes, a tunnel! - yelled Ciano. Sir, you’ve just uttered an ingenious idea, mon cher. Gentlemen? Always together, huh? - You’re in shape? - Of course. I’m counting on you. Not so good. You need to work. When I was eighteen, I was nothing but skin and bones but now… Chest of iron! Let’s go, gents! - You got something funny? - Wanna hear it? I can’t laugh twice. Your uncle is upstairs in his suite, gentlemen. Engineer, meet my nephews. Professor Hahn’s boys. Nice to meet you. Bohdański. - Your mother... - Gentlemen... allow me to leave you to finish my toilette. You got something for me? - I do, uncle. - Talk. Murder trial. The judge asks a witness: How was your first marriage terminated? By death, your honor. -By whose death? -Guess. How much do you pay, chairman? I pay the most for those that are anti National Democracy, and the least for antisemitic ones. Chairman, I wanted to thank you for everything you’ve done for me. Oh, well… You’ve been chosen by the gods. Act accordingly. Adieu. Oh, well. Life. This cynical hunter kills his victim at the door of great fame. Bogdański? He borrowed bills of exchange from prince Hohenloh’s safe and he doesn’t have them. But Bogdański is a man of honor and he’ll have to shoot himself. I told him take your time, there’s no hurry, wait, there will be a war. I can feel it in my bones. Other things will be important. Other things. Good morning, king-ding. Good morning, scallywags. Say good morning. Good morning. Scallywags. Where were you? What did you do? We were... They were at the ZOO. They were to see my brother, Leon, to tell him jokes. How much did he pay you? I’m sorry. I forgot it’s a secret. The knowledge of life which brings happiness to the unprepared, and us, the prepared wise men, sends to depths of despair and doubt. Your brother’s an idiot. He thinks history can be closed in a single gesture. How about in such a gesture? We kindly ask for dollars. We kindly do. I’m only doing this for you. Jesus Christ, Michał. What happened? Were you bleeding? No, mother, I got dirty eating cherries. When the war starts, I’ll join the Lancers. So will I. Look! - Look how gorgeous she is! - Where? Come. I’ll put my head between those tits. What is it really about? Is it about freedom of the Germans in Gdańsk, which is not in danger, or about prestigious matters, or is it about moving Poland away from the Baltic Sea, for which Poland will never allow! What are you doing here? We came… you know. Why didn’t you say so? Mr. Jankowski! Squirts are here for the papers! - Give’em papers. - What papers? - What are the papers for? - What was I to say? Didn’t I tell you it’s a Daimler Benz? You’re the baron in such a limousine. It’s better than the ones the police have. Quiet, slave. Go shine your master’s shoes. These are the international affairs experts. - Do you recognize them? - Of course. The Hahn brothers. They should join the League of Nations. I’m sure they will. In jail. They wanted to return the car. It doesn’t matter, professors. Poles should have more dignity. My grandfather was German. - That’s ever worse. - The Hahns. When I first saw you, I had a moment of genuine pride. When I first saw you, I thought: Here are two Athenian youths who will follow the ideal of good and beauty, Kalos Kagathos. But hubris nestled in your minds and I have no other choice but to expel you. And to black list you! You’re expelled. You can collect their documents, professor. What is it about? What are you afraid of? What am I afraid of? That one phone call! I wonder what the consul will have to say about this. What laws can the consul revoke? He can talk about the 1907 Hague Convention, about international scandal, he can treat this event as a provocation. This was in the car. In the car? This is the local daily paper. German Embassy? Consul von Ziegler. So tell me what you’re going to testify? It looks like they’re about to tell the truth, sir. This is the truth, gentlemen. You were members of illegal anti-German organization which planned to kidnap Consul General of the Reich in Poznań. This attempt was thwarted by our counterintelligence. Is that understood? You planned to kidnap the consul, for you planned to demand the ransom in the amount of 20 000 marks. To continue the terror, understand? Of course, it’s all a lie. I know that it’s a lie. Your truth is beyond the scale of your deed. Sir, can you come here for a moment! Yes, I do identify them. These two young men distributed subversive leaflets around the city. I followed them and saw them do it. I have them here. Yes. Yes, indeed. Well? Do you plead guilty? Yes. No. All right, Toni Kruger. Connect me to the mayor. The mayor already knows that you allowed the boys to take the car. And that they should be released. Come in. Come in. Don’t pretend to be shy. Did you go to the German printig house before you took the car? Were you to distribute the paper? Then run home and quickly before I tear your legs out of your asses! And you’ll go and cancel everything. - Me? - You were the one chasing them! Listen and be quiet! Then you’ll go to the consul and apologize for the mistake. There was no car theft. It was a police provocation. Do you hear me? Our provocation. The boys got the car from the consul to distribute German newspapers. And you prevented them from doing it. Then you’ll go to school and tell them to accept them back. They were never expelled, do you hear me? He’ll live. And you learn from your international experiences. I understand. - You don’t. - I do. You do? They shouldn’t go back to the same school. What? - They shouldn’t… - Andrzej! They shouldn’t go back to the same school. - I want to. - Andrzej? I want to go back. Michał, don’t go back to the same school, please. Mum? What? What’s there behind you? - Books. - Go there. Top shelf. In the middle. Higher. This one. What is it? - What title? - Vatican Cellars. Who wrote it? - André Gide. - Next to it. To the left. - Which one? - Lower, the first one. - Short stories. Thomas Mann. - Under it. In the middle. Where? Lower? To the right, no, in the middle. Son, it’s Balzac. Cousin Bette. - And under the Cousin? - What’s this about? In the middle. This one This one. Marcel Proust. Put them here by the bed. All of them? That’s what I said. He demanded several books at once. You think it’s normal? Why? Not one book. Several. Apparently, he wants to read them all. He’s always been so systematic. Kid, what other devilish ideas are brewing in this head of yours? You took those clothes from your father? It’s a much more serious matter, I’d say international. I don’t understand. Weren’t you the one telling me to join the League of Nations? I admit it was not in good taste. Why? I took it seriously. And here I am. Look Hahn, these few sympathizers of the League of Nations in our school are all future law students. But I believe you have different interests? Interests can be changed. Make me a chairman. In two weeks, this room will be full. You stole the limousine form the consul? What was I to steal? The consul? What’s today’s subject? Opinions of the Court of Justice. - What for? - It’s in the League of Nations. Does the League know about your organization? No. Why would they? That’s a mistake. We must let the League know - and change the name. - Why? You know… I’ve always associated a sympathizer with an onanist. - Watch it, Hahn! - Why would it? Because the name is the most important. The name is the idea. For instance - the Union. Ligue of Nations Friends’ Union. Doesn’t it sound better? England - London, Argentine - Buenos Aires, - Abyssinia - Addis Abeba. - What was that? Belgium - Brussels, Brazil - Rio de Janeiro This place was a mess when you were gone. The principal almost got a heart attack. - Why aren’t you saying anything? - What’s there to say? Why did he admit you back? I promised I’d kidnap the consul. You do have a specific sense of humor, Hahn. Czechoslovakia? Berlin? Entente. Entente? Entente? That’s the primary cause. A much more serious matter than the state. Entente created the League of Nations, which rules all the countries like Vatican rules the church. And Abyssinia? I’ve heard something. Abyssinia is the colossus’ small stumble. Now we run fast! You’re making a mess again? You never put it back. - I’m sorry. - What are you reading? In Search of Lost Time. Sentences here are two pages long. There I have an idiot who can’t utter a word. Simplification. Make simpler... And here are sentences that are two pages long. Will you attend the Union of Friends’ inaugural lecture? I will. If you invite me. That’s great. And will you announce that the Union of Friends of the League takes over foreign contacts here, in the school? Of course. That’s obvious, isn’t it? How’s Michał doing? He’s gone mad. Why is the League of Nations such a weak organization? Why is it unable to cope with the growing crisis? Why, gentlemen? Why can’t it cope with the growing crisis? Because, just like any international organization, it is ruled by Jews and Masons. Ruled by dark forces of conspiracy, which do not desire unity. We want the strong League of Nations. We. The Union. We, the Union. ANDRZEJ - ORGANIZATION - MONEY What now? Something about the Treaty of Versailles. I’ll give you a very interesting work. Our university’s achievement. The University which is compared to Gottingen, to Heidelberg. To Heidelberg before 1933, that is. Analysis of international ties, that I found in Europe. It is terrifying in its purport. Europe is a feeding ground, on which something’s rotting, something’s decaying, something’s pulsating. Only chaos, nothing but decaying chaos. I hate Europe. You promised me something, sir. You promised to introduce me to the consul. Bon apetit. Someone looked through my notebook again. You’re overreacting. Andrzej, please, don’t come late for dinner. He already knows. I can read you what I wrote, just tell me to. Is it how it’s done? - Some did it. - Who? Tolstoy, for instance. Those dinners must have been long. Stefan! Just think. Stefan... Think! He read War and Peace over dinner. When did they sleep? Will I be speaking as a representative of my country or as a private person? As a representative of your country. Berlin must agree to this. And it’ll take time. What if you acted as a private person? I think I still have that kind of freedom, right professor? Speaking of freedom, why do you hate Europe so much? It has to do with age. The older one gets, the less tolerant one becomes. But today’s youth isn’t at all tolerant. Right, Andrzej? Let’s go, professor. Next year I’ll be driving a Horch. I won’t be needing you today. Get in, Mr. Hahn. Don’t look so glum. We’ll take professor home. You’d better drive. You do know how valuable this limousine is. Andrzej, call me when you’re ready. We’ll go for a ride. I’m curious which route you took when you borrowed my car. Your police commissioner claims that you wanted to kidnap me for ransom. Strangely, he’s convinced of it. What should I talk about to the members of your organization? About the reasons which led Germans to leave the League of Nations. Is that acceptable? An interesting subject. I need a week to prepare. Of course. - You’re playing? - I am. Draw now. There is no organization without money. - Does it work? - No. Order an entry fee of 100 zlotys. I’ll order 200 if I have to. And you’ll become a treasurer. - Let’s play. - Shuffle. Who’s playing with whom? Let’s play as we seat. You’re shuffling. - And? - He wants 2 000. - Is he crazy? - He can’t sell it cheaper. - Does it come with a clip? - Sure! Fuck! I told you there’s no organization without money. What about the consul? It’s fine. He’ll let us drive. We just need to eliminate the driver. Fine. Do you really believe what you’re saying? Do you believe what you’re reading? Beck believes what he’s saying. Bullshit. Neither Beck believes it, nor Goebbels. It’s a game. - You won’t be playing? - I’d rather look from a side. - You’re missing out. -Maybe I am. But I’ll be there for the consul’s lecture. How do you know? How do you know, I want to invite the consul? Don’t think about it. Bad writers describe the likes of you: He was to become a happy man. And good writers? Good writers? Good writers observe. - Who are you here to see? - Mr. Feliński. - He’s drinking on stage. - Yes. Uncle! This is Michał Hahn. My godson. The future of Poland. And this is Poland’s past: Michał Szik, a violinist. Mikołaj Palasz, a playwrite. Andrzej Podchorski, a fallen poet. Franciszka Felińska, my muse and inspiration. And me. Your disinherited godfather. The most tragic person of them all. Come up to the stage. What’s that you’re holding? - My story. - You finished it? - No. - Don’t. Stay in the auditorium. My tragedy is so great that I have to drink on stage. That’s the only proper scale. Your tragedy is that you’re pathologically jealous. Write a play about it. What’s funny isn’t always dramatic. You don’t know how to suffer, Maks. To create a masterpiece, one must first swim in a lot of shit. If so, I’m giving you Franciszka. You can rape her. But write a great poem! Of course I’ll rape her. Our world is dying natural death, gentleman. That’s about time. I’m awfully tired with it. Gentlemen, young generation is listening. Are you also so corrupt? Leave him be, he’s from a decent home. So it’s time to drop the shackles. He’s already rebelled. He’s stolen consul’s limousine. He could have started a war. Where? Where are you going? Where? Fuck off, man. Fuck off. Why are you laughing at me, gentlemen? And you laughed the hardest. Take a seat, man. You laughed the hardest. - We’ll fight. - Sit down. Come to the side, we’ll fight there. There are no sides here. Just the wings. Poland has not yet died So long as we still live. Come to the side, we’ll fight. Poland has not yet died as long as we still live. Guadeloupe seamen. Come, come. Mr. Michał Hahn. Tonight’s mascot. Nice to meet you - Bogdański. We’ve already met. Do forgive me but I don’t remember. It was... in chairman Sobierajski’s suite. Oh, yes, of course. I was very distracted then. Master! You’re leading again. Master! And for the little one? Just a smidge. I’m an artist. Sure you can. You can do anything. Anything. There’ll be no punishment. The final judgement is to be a great surprise. Of course, there’ll be bad people who’ll ruin all the fun by hiding in the darkest places. Darkest places. I know where to get the money. From Bogdański. How? He’s a thief, a snitch, and a drug addict. Ask him to pay for your silence. Well… Write to Bogdański. You write. You’re the author. Fine. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, leave me please. Just leave me alone. Do not blackmail me anymore. Please, gentlemen. See? Action - reaction, action - reaction. Acts on command. You didn’t talk to us about that. I haven’t talked to you about many things. Many things aren’t done here, Michał Hahn. What brings you here? Prose? You were printing, weren’t you? A Poem About Jesus, yes. Am I to assess? Are you here for the sake of our old friendship? You did the right thing. I’ll give you my honest opinion. I’ll give you the whole truth, man to man. That’s what you want? Yes. Please. You know very well that nothing here happens fast. Just think. I’m teaching. I’m waiting. So what will this writing give you, huh? You find it funny, mother? No. Sit. I just don’t know, what one feels. I don’t know what one feels, that’s all. One feels power. One feels fire. No. One feels fervour that burns one out. And one is jealous of everyone else who just must succeed. Will you succeed? - Answer me. Will you? - I don’t know yet. You’ve changed. Apparently this changes people. Well, Hahn, you write... long sentences. Because the story is short. You, Andrzej, take on the manners of a leader. I hear you’re setting up Hitler - Jugend. I will if need be. You show... undoubted literary knowledge. Yes, quite a knowledge. What else can I tell you? I don’t believe a single word you wrote here. But if that’s true… No, it’s fiction. You know what, Hahn? Literature isn’t born out of thin air. Can I give it to someone else so they could assess it? I cared for your assessment but if you want to… In any case, you can safely consider it your first literary success. You can see here all the Polish kings. My visit here is both optimistic and symbolic. The lecture which I give standing under your eagle shows that unnecessary tensions between our two countries won’t last long. The great German writer talked about the spirit of politics and the spirit of art. He talked about similarities and about contradictions. I would rather focus on similarities. I’m convinced by a writer who says: “You can disguise yourself, dress up as an attaché, as a Lieutenant of the Guard on vacation, but you can barely raise your eyes, you can barely open your mouth, - and everyone knows you’re a nobody.” - He’s quoting Mann. Interesting. “…that you are someone strange... someone weird... someone else.” But you’ll recognize the artist at first glance. I was asked why Germany left the League of Nations. Well, in the last scene of The Magic Mountain Hans Castorp gets lost in the trenches of the Great War. What was the brave soldier’s further faith? Did he die or manage to survive? Let’s imagine, he’s left his seclusion to march with the others. Let’s imagine, that he didn’t die, that he saved himself. If he did, he saw that victorious powers prevented Germany from attending the Versailles conference and imposed a deal that would make Germany lose its importance in Europe forever. Disarmed Germany was to have only a professional army of 100 000. Brave Hans Castorp would be surprised, hearing about the 15-year occupation of the Rhineland, about the occupation of the Saar Basin, about the fact that only Germany was blamed for the outbreak of the war. This simple-minded Castorp, a humble rationalist, son of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck, would certainly be very surprised. Mr. Andrzej Hahn please come with me. Do excuse me. He’d have been amazed that the provisions of the Versailles Treaty were to be controlled by the League of Nations, which did not want to admit Germany as a member, but allowed the victorious powers to exploit Germany in the majesty of the law that it should uphold. I know that Hans Castorp would not wring his hands. He would not go back to his seclusion, to this sanatorium in Davos. Rather, he’d roll up his sleeves to show that Germany cannot be exploited by force. You fucking policemen! You can do shit! We’re not policemen but they can be here soon. All I got to do is dial a number. Who ratted? Adam Hartwig. That’s your name in Michał’s story. "Adam Hartwig was deeply affected by the public humiliation he was subjected to by the police chief in our seemingly peaceful and sleepy town. So he decided to do exactly what the police chief accused him of and to what he confessed. In a word: he decided to kidnap the consul and dot the i’s. Contrary to the appearances that he created around him Adam was a weak and insecure man, but he never wanted to admit his weaknesses. Just as he would never admit his immaturity, for he wanted too much to be masculine and bodacious”. Should I go on? Please. “The fact that he managed to easily gain control over school organization, raised him up to the level never before achievable to him”. More? Enough. I understand. No, no I don’t. I’ll translate it for you. Mr. Hahn, do you know you’re German? Do you know that great Germany will be here in few weeks? And Germans will come to you, they’ll address you, they’ll address their countryman and what will you tell them? You are an intelligent man. What will you tell them? That you didn’t know? What do you think I should do? The same thing you’re doing. Just not here and not now. And not as a Polish brat, but as German patriot. Can I have the notebook back? You’ll get it. When you deserve it. He would have noted, however, that not even the thought of de facto equal rights for Germany is allowed. The proof was the League of Nations’ categorical refusal to grant Germany equal rights in the field of arms. What is Hans Castorp doing now? To quote Adolf Hitler: “In foreign policy, the government's mission will be to defend Germany's right to exist, and thus to regain our nation’s freedom. The government will help to include Germany in the community of nations as a state equal to others, thus having the same rights.” Thank you. It was brave of you to quote Thomas Mann. Have I managed to gain a little trust? Because I was also quoting Hitler. Not the first time, I might add. Wasn’t this your duty? My duty? Yes, it might have been my duty. But to whom? To Hitler? Gents, we’re looking for the driver! To school, around the corner. Are you mad? Why didn’t you get in the car? - You fucker. - Don’t be hysterical. I’ll get in the car when the time is right. Where have you been? Hurry up, god dammit. Your duty is to wait for me by the car. How did it happen? That’s how they react when the German consul speaks in a Polish school to the friends of the League of Nations! Did you inform Berlin about what happened? Don’t you understand, that this is Berlin’s reaction? Get in. Does a municipal court judge have a right to philander in a brothel? He doesn’t. Does a magistrate clerk, a father, have the right to screw in a brothel? Does Adam’s father have the right to philander in a brothel? God! That’s my old man. And who’s this? He doesn’t have a right to philander either. I paid. Treasurer! All the money for the brothel. Do you agree? Yes! Organization is disbanded. Why? I’ll come back to you after the holidays. Do you agree? Yes! - Do you trust me? - Yes! Show me your cocks! So? Shall we have fun? We can. Where was I? Where? Where were you? Come. Come. Is uncle Maks here? He is. Drunk and asleep. I came to talk to you, uncle. - To me? - Yes. So talk. Talk. Nothing serves conversation like a shared bed. The boy has problems. He wants to write. He can’t do it. He’s not very good at it. So he wants to be an artist. You took it out of my mouth. I don’t remember. Your relative wants to be an artist. - Does your father know? - No. So art is not a toy for children. It starts innocently; a letter to an editor, a poem for a fiancée, an innocent thought of plagiarism… And just like with vodka, you become addicted. You become weird, you think the world doesn’t understand you. Maks... But you don’t understand that he wants to be a great artist. You have to do something awful. Something, that will follow you your whole life. Like killing your own mother. Have you read Stavrogin’s Confession? He wants to be great. So be great. This brave new world awaits your greatness. And write about us, about her, about me. Be great, be outstanding, describe us. Show me to the world. Me and this whole bloody family because I can't. Don’t worry. He doesn’t believe in anything anymore. He’s only waiting for it all to start. Do you have a gas mask? They’re said to attack with gas. For God’s sake! For God’s sake, someone took a piss here! Shush, woman, shush. Grab a cloth and wipe it dry. - Jesus. - What are we paying you for? - Jesus. - Are you stunned? Mrs. Hahn! Mrs. Abramska, leave that alone. I’ll wipe it. Ease yourself, you didn’t make it with the consul. I’m not done with the consul, I’m not done with the consul. In our family, the stronger never beats the weaker! Don’t speak for the whole family. As far as I know, we have close relatives in Germany. Uncle Karol, uncle Grubisz, the Hahn cousins in Essen. Should I enumerate further? - What are you reading? - No reading while eating. The Vatican Cellars. You should read it. What’s it about? About a young man who commits murder as an experiment. He wanted to define the limits of his freedom. Have you defined them yet? I have. Writing gives me freedom. I don’t understand a thing. But no matter. - So you feel free? - Yes. I can’t... I don’t know how to talk to you. Maybe they decide against it. Summer is a bad time for politicians. Professor, this can’t be connected to seasons. Noel keeps hindering us, Chamberlain doesn’t have a clue. Let them finally make up their minds and soon. I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m scared. Worried about the boys. I’m teaching him. Nothing. So I’m waiting. Demosthenes was also born with a speech impediment. What are you writing? Michał, you’re writing about us? We don’t exist anymore. I’m writing about myself, mother. You’re too young for that. Too young. Why did you say you don’t exist anymore? Isn’t that obvious? Scallywags… - Michał? - Yes? Take your uncle back to the hotel. Fine. We’re not seeing patients today. Molar tooth is moving. That’s different. Mr. Andrzej Hahn. Your great-grandfather was a German, born in Bavaria. Came to Poznań in 1877. Establishes a branch of Hanh China and Faience, LTD. He marries a Pole and stays. - Is that accurate, Mr. Hahn? - Yes. Your father will have to decide but Mr. Andrzej Hahn already has. Is that right? Yes. These are your people. My dear Hahn. Were you in the prosectorium? Lot’s of dead bodies. Nothing to worry about. You’ll go there and help them load. Can I have my notebook back? You came here, so you will. These are IDs and Polish mobilization cards. Put those in their pockets. We must feed the German hatred. Mr. Hahn! This might come in handy. Mr. Hahn! So will this. From a mental hospital. 50 per person. Lift it, lift it. Shirt, tie, pants. Pants, shirt, tie. We got them. Come here and help. Move it, quickly. Zemanek told me to give this to you. He said that this other person who read it is delighted. - You’re done writing? - No. Why? Work is further away from me than my fingernail from my eye. As Rimbaud would say. What would Rimbaud say about dressing corpses? I don’t know. How did Rimbaud die? His leg got rotten. His leg got rotten? His leg got rotten. And I thought artists have beautiful deaths. You guessed right. Gentlemen! You can begin! Adam Hartwig was deeply affected by the public humiliation he was subjected to by his commanding officer in our seemingly peaceful and sleepy town. So he decided to do exactly what the officer accused him of and to what he confessed. In a word: Adam Hartwig decided to kidnap the consul and dot his i’s. Contrary to the appearances he created around him, Adam Hartwig was a weak and insecure man. but he never wanted to admit his weaknesses. Just as he would never admit his immaturity, for he wanted too much to be masculine and bodacious. Why me? Translated by Emilia Puszczyńska
