THE 400 BLOWS This film is dedicated to the memory of André Bazin Doinel! Bring me that! Indeed! Go to the corner! 1 minute left. Quiet! We'll collect them in 30 seconds. Quiet! Line heads, get ready! I'll count to 3. 1... 2... 3! Collect! Collect in back! - Gimme! - Wait a sec! - What is it? - He won't give it. No favoritism! Brown-noser! Is everyone's paper in? You may go. Sorry! Not you! Recess is a reward, not an obligation. Here suffered Antoine Doinel unfairly punished by a prof for a pin-up clad barely. So it's now forsooth, eye for eye, tooth for tooth! Alright, champs, maybe you need a ref. You can train for 3 days. No recess! 3 days of rest will do you good. Come look! This is funny. What's so interesting there? Take your seats! Bravo! We have a new Juvenal in our class. But he can't tell an Alexandrine from a decasyllable! Doinel, sit down! For tomorrow you'll conjugate... in all tenses of the indicative... conditional and subjunctive moods. Your notebooks! I dirty the classroom walls... and misuse French versification. The Hare... Doinel, go to the janitor and get something to remove that nonsense or else you'll lick it off! Richer, who said you could change seats? In the days when the bushes... the bushes... were aflame with flowers... bright red... When already the dark tips... When already... the dark tips... of my long ears... were seen... above my head... In the still unripe rye... I munched on... the leaves... Pointing to the sky. One day... comma... weary I lay... in my den... with sleep-filled eyes... When little Margot found me by surprise! - Right, Simonot? - It wasn't me, sir! Sure! The other guy! True, she liked me... very much... my gentle mistress! How good to me... so caring... such tenderness! How she held me on her lap... and kissed me! What fool whistled? Confess or I'll punish anybody! Right, Simonot? I swear, sir! It wasn't me! And you're cowards! What a class! I've known morons but at least they didn't let it show. They hid in their corner. And you? Call that clean! You've made it dirtier! Copy the poem! Your parents'll pay. What'll France be like in 10 years? - All guys rob their parents. - Yeah but it's hard. Even Mauricet! Mauricet! Where'd you buy those goggles? A department store. Did ya swipe the money from your dad or your ma? Don't tell me ya don't go through their pockets! And ya got me caught earlier! Ya bastard! - Your days're numbered! - You'll get yours! I'll never do it all tonight. That prof's a bastard. It's his job! But before I'm drafted... I'll bash his head in! That I would have dirtied the classroom walls... - Evening, Mama! - Good evening... Where's the flour? - What flour? - You didn't buy what I wrote down! - Where's the list I left you? - I lost it. No wonder you get such bad grades! Get my slippers! In the bedroom! Under the bed! I need some flour. Go get it at once! Yes, Mama. They used forceps. He came out ass first! It's hereditary! His mother was the same way. It means nothing! Look at my Fanny! It was over in 10 minutes. But for the little one, if I hadn't had a Caesarean, we wouldn't be talkin' now! And my sister... One a year! Can you imagine? They finally took out everything. Blood all over the place! In a rush, son? I just got hell for some flour. Don't upset your mother! She has to be handled with care. - What's that? - An anti-fog spotlight. I'm gonna try it out Sunday. Look at your son! All flour-faced! I'm not in the mood! I was hoping you were. And my change? - I need money for the cafeteria. - Ask your dad. A storm's brewing! - Papa, for the cafeteria... - What? I need 1,000 francs. Ya ask for 1,000 and hope for 500. So ya only need 300. Here's 100. Take 500. But your mom's supposed to pay that. The scissors! Where are the scissors? It's not funny! No homework now! It's time to eat. Right! Each thing has its time and place. That way, the cows're safe! Is that a new pen? I made a swap for it. You swap a lot lately! What's that smell? It's the fish. And how! Ask your mom if her hot-pad is hot. Why? For laughs! You can clear the table now. Your cousin phoned. His wife is expecting again. Her 4th in 3 years? They're like rabbits. Disgusting! And what about our kid during vacation? - Who're summer camps for? - He'd have fun there. It's 8 months off! Never too early to plan a vacation. Don't pull so hard! Great, huh? Lions' Club... What's all this? Take it easy! For Sunday's race... shall I pick the Chevreuse Valley or along the Oise? On Sunday I rest. I'm going to see Huguette. But I'm the race organiser! I'm sick of housework... And dates in the afternoon! I mean the edible kind! What're you waiting for? Go to bed! G'night! You can be so stupid! If you could only take a joke... Your auto races are a waste of time! The garbage! Lights out as soon as you're in bed. I make contacts! One day I'll be vice-president. Hurry up! It's late! I didn't hear the alarm. That I would have dirtied the classroom walls... There's no socks around these holes! Buy a new pair! The others are in the laundry. I gave you money for sheets for the kid's bed. He prefers his sleeping bag. Right, honey? At least I'm warm in it. You still here? Bye, Pa! Mama! Don't rush so fast! We'll get locked out and have to see the director. - No need to hurry! - Why? The prof said he won't let ya in. - He means it? - He can't stand you. - Have you money? - Yes for the canteen. Trust me... This way! What'll we do now? Follow me! Put your satchel with mine. Antoine! He saw me! - Which one's he? - With dark hair. But he should be in school! - You'll get it! - She won't dare tell Dad. - And the guy? - Never saw him before. So you're safe! I'm going to school tomorrow... but I'll need an excuse. How'll you manage? I've got an old one. I'll cut off the date. You can borrow it and copy it. But the handwriting? Imitate your mother's. That'll be hard. It's angular. - Don't worry, it'll work. - I hope so! Bye! I ask you to please... excuse... my son... René... who was ill... My son René! It smells like something burnt! That's downstairs. Set the table just for 2. Why? Is Mom gone? She phoned me to say she'll be late tonight. Her boss needs her for the budget. So we'll cook and have a man-to-man dinner. She mentioned some eggs someplace. I know where they are. Did you study hard today? What'd you do? The hare. And the tortoise? No, just questions about the hare. - Did you answer right? - He didn't ask me. You've got to speak up! If not, you're out of the race. You've got to take the initiative in life. Have you thought of your mother's birthday? It's the 17th. I hope you'll give her something. You hear me? I know what you think. She's been hard on you lately but... she's a very nervous woman. Put yourself in her shoes! She has her housework plus an afternoon job. And this place is too tiny. But we'll move. I got a lead on a new place. In an office it's always the same story. Women are exploited and can't defend themselves. But she loves you. Oh shit! - Where'd you put my Michelin guide? - I didn't touch it. You know I can't stand lying. I put it in its place yesterday. It's not me! It's crazy how things disappear! It's not me. I'll ask your mother. It's time for bed. Don't forget the garbage. My boss drove me home. Exactly! I couldn't say no to that. - Night work pays double. - Wait'll ya see my pay! That kind of overtime is paid cash! No wonder you need to rest on Sunday! Where's my Michelin? No idea! The kid might know. - He doesn't. - He's a liar! - Like you! - If ya raised him right... Shit! I gave him a name! I feed him! I'm sick of your complaints! Fed up! If ya can't stand him, say so. We'll put him in an orphanage... so I can have some peace! We'll eat out till the end of the month! How? I don't have a clean shirt! You could at least do the collars. You and your anti-foglight! Just to show off. I bought it second-hand. Go open the door. Maybe it's the gas man. They send a notice first. I'm in Antoine's class. Is he any better? Why? He missed school yesterday. Ya hear that? You don't seem surprised. Why should I be? He's capable of anything. What'll my excuse be? The bigger the lie, the better it works. When Ma broke her leg, I went back... without an excuse. I can't make up a story like that. We mustn't go in together. Right. You go first. So there you are! Extra homework made you sick, eh? Your folks fell for it? I'd like to see what kind of excuse you have. - Let's have it. - I don't have one. You expect to get away with it like that? It'd be too easy! Sir, it's my mother... What about her? She's just died. I'm sorry... I didn't know. Was she ill? Yes, sir. You could've told me. You should confide in your teachers. Go join the others. And your excuse? Never mind! 'Tis best a thorn in the wood... ...than in the ass! If you'd wash your ears you'd hear your prompter! Up your'ear! He's just trying to confuse me. Enough! Continue. I'm all mixed up. Than in the flowers... ...the flowers. 'Tis best independence... And incessant peril... Than slavery... In eternal April. You're an eternal loafer! Sit down! I knew it at home. - Doinel! - Yes, sir! I'm sorry... Simonot! The Hare... Sit down! He must be punished within the limits. He's beyond all limits! Only his parents can deal with such a mistake. We'll settle this tonight at home! What'll you do? After this I can't live with my parents any more. I've got to disappear. Mine've been through worse! Yeah, but I want to live my own life. I'll write them a letter. - Right now? - It's best that way. Where'll ya sleep? I don't know. I don't care. I've got an idea. Be at the Pigalle fountain in 1 hour. OK. It's my uncle's old print shop. The floor collapsed under the heavy machines. Will it collapse again? It can't fall any lower. You'll be warm here. A mattress... This'll do for a pillow. It's real heavy! Go for a walk till midnight. - Keep my satchel until tomorrow. - OK. Dear Parents... I understand the seriousness of my lie... Why'd he kill me instead of you? A matter of preference. Life between us is impossible. So I'm going to try my luck in the city or elsewhere. I want to become a man. When I see you again, we'll have a full explanation. I close with kisses... Antoine - It's normal that he hates me? - You're hard on him. He gets on my nerves! - Can you help me catch him? - Sure! - Your sister? - No, her dog got away. - It's a lost dog or hers? - I don't know! - May I help? - Yes! The more, the better! - What's his name? - I've no idea. Forget it, kid. But I saw him first! Understand me? - Doinel! - Yes, sir? - Did things explode last night? - No, everything was fine. Parents spoil 'em rotten! Chabrol, want some help? The last question is even easier. The tip of the tongue between the teeth... as if you're lisping. I can't. Not everyone can use their tongue like you said. Quiet! S... Si... Go sit down! Impudent! Now you! Answer me. Doinel? Frochot, take over until I return. We don't know how to handle him! Madam, you don't deserve such a rascal. My poor baby! Where'd you spend the night? - In a print shop. - At a printer's? I don't care if he's last so long as he behaves. Fine! Maybe it's... glandular. You mustn't catch cold. And now to bed! I'm not sleepy. You'll be better off in our bed. You know, I was your age once. Kids forget that! I was stubborn and wouldn't confide in my parents. So I wrote everything in a diary. Nobody's ever read it. One day I'll show it to you. At your age I went on vacation with a shepherd boy I liked but... they caught us! Ma made me swear not to see him again... and never told Papa. So I cried a lot but I obeyed her. We should always obey our mothers. We can have secrets! What did you mean in your letter... about having a full explanation? I meant about my bad behavior and why I don't study hard. So, tell me. I don't know how to listen. So I want to quit and earn my own living. That's crazy! You've no idea! I so regret not going beyond high school! Your dad has only an elementary diploma. It hampers him! I know school teaches lots of useless stuff. Algebra and science don't... help many people. But French! You always need it for writing letters! Let's share another secret, OK? On your next French essay... if you're among... the top 5, I'll give you 1,000 francs. But don't tell your father! Suddenly the dying man rose up on his fists... and shot a lightning glance at his terrified children. The hair at his nape moved. His wrinkles quivered. His face brightened. A breath wafted his face, making it sublime. He lifted his fist... and shouted Archimedes' famous word... Eureka! I have found it! Describe a major event you witnessed and which concerned you personally. Eureka! I have found it! The Death of My Grandfather... The monkey's finally laid the new typist! She's made the most of it! She got herself named executive secretary. She fills all the requirements! Gotta be careful of her now because of pillow talk. When she was on the road, I told her how to juggle her expense account. Instead of that, she stayed in 3-star hotels! Say, I still haven't found my Michelin hotel guide. One of you has moved it. Oh, you and your Michelin! I don't like mysteries! What's on the stove? Nothing! I'm sure! Put it out! Don't yell! Get some water! Ya blockhead! What made ya light a candle in there? It was for Balzac. Balzac? Ya take me for a fool? - For my French essay! - Yes, he promised me something. What? A bonus for fire damage? Ya need more than a candle! - Want my lighter? - Don't be silly! For as long as you're living here, you'll do as I say! If not, it means military academy! Know what that is? You'll find out! And you'll toe the line! Know what we'll do for a change of air? We'll all go to the movies tonight! Fine! A great method of education! - How's your French essay? - Not bad. Listen, Julian... Trust us! He wants to surprise us. - I don't like this! - Take us to the movies? - What's playing? - Paris Is Ours. - If you're plotting... - Rather not go? Sure, I'll go! I've worked hard. I deserve it! But the Gaumont Theatre doesn't like arsonists. My ice cream bar was good! I'd never had strawberry. They're not in season! She really had... how shall I say... she had lots of... - That's all you ever notice... - Lots of class! - I liked that movie. - Yeah, but it wasn't funny. Not funny? But it had depth! - What? - Depth! - The movie! - Yeah... It's time for bed. Beddy-bye! It's Satan's general and his staff! Your mom's got nice legs, eh? Back to our happy hearth... but a little smoky! The garbage, honey! I hope I won't regret trying to win him over. Doinel! If your essay is first today it's because I've decided to rank them by starting from the bottom. Your search for the absolute led you straight to a zero. For you who don't know Balzac... it concerns A Gloomy Affair. Doinel has the right to take the death of a relative as his subject... although we know he easily sacrifices his dear ones, whenever convenient. I didn't copy, sir! Listen to this! Suddenly the dying man rose up... and shot a lightning glance at his terrified children. His hair stood on end and his eybrows arched. His face brightened with a sublime look. He shouted Archimedes' famous word... Eureka! I've found it! Well, I found it too! - You plagiarist! - It's not true. Take your essay at once to the principal. Colombel, go with him. And stay out till the end of the term! What's with you? I sat next to him. He didn't copy it! Want to be expelled? That's OK. Such impudence! Get out! Expel me but don't kick me out! Out! That's illegal. I'll show you who makes the laws here! Did you take him? - He ran away. - Ran away? I slugged him and ran... And you? He threw me out till after Christmas. Now I really can't go home. Dad said... he'd put me in an academy. - What's that? - Something military. You'd have a uniform and a future. No thanks! If only it were the Navy! I'd like to see the ocean. I've seen the Channel, the Atlantic... and the Mediterranean but not the North Sea. Stay at my house. We'll manage! Holy cow! A horse! It's my dad's. A souvenir. What a huge place! Clean off the sofa. You can sleep here. And your parents? Never here! Mom drinks and Dad is always at the races. This place is wide open. We need to start a business. Yeah, we need money. But we need some to start with. In that case... I'll use part of my inheritance. Quiet! Mom may be around. Anyone here? - Hello, madam! - Little devil! - Seen your mother lately? - Today after school. She makes sure her hours never coincide with mine. She must be up to something. Where's the fruit? Here! 9:30! I'll be late at the club! Hurry up! We'll miss the news! Yeah, I know, Inspector, you'll lock me up for life. But drop by Duely's around 8:00. Ya might meet a pal with sharp teeth. I'm thirsty! It's already empty! Come on! Play! You threw a 12? It's my old man! Help shake the blankets! That's enough! What's going on? It's a smokehouse! A real gambling den! I'll deduct 3 cigars from your allowance. Bucephalus is not for your junk! He's worth a million! A work of art! I'll never give him up until the last minute! Now turn out the lights and go to sleep! - 'Night, Pa! - Goodnight. - Not bad! - By god! Great! Give me your Michelin. A million'd be great! My dad would kill me because of that horse. With a million we'll find a beach... open a boat business and no one'll bother us! - Make up your mind. - Dad's office has some. - Don't back down! - We can't sell it. They're numbered. - We won't sell it, we'll pawn it! - Smart! Ma pawned all our stuff. - How much? - 10&#x25;. - 1,000 right away. - When you come back! You sure trust me! Give us back our typewriter! Runnin' away? - I thought you'd gone this way. - Sure! They wouldn't take it! Then give it back. - Gimme 500 for the time I spent. - We're broke. Ya must have something! 300 and that'll do it. No! Give it back! I don't work for free! I'll keep it as a deposit. It's ours! Give it back or I'll slug ya! Hands off! It's no more yours than it is mine! - Let's ask that cop. - Shut up! Keep the damn thing! Shit-heads! - I'm tired of carrying it! - It's your turn. Dad'll surely think I swiped it. - It was your idea. - Yours! - I don't care. I quit! - Ya lost your mind? I gotta take it back to Dad's office but... I'll wear a hat. If the guard sees me, he'll think it's a man. Take it back for me! No way! It wasn't my idea! You're a bastard! I'll put my hat on. Wait for me by the store. Why, you're the Doinel boy! Put that down. Your papa's gonna love this! And I get hell for not watching things enough! This'll cost ya! And don't try to pull a Houdini on me! I know the ropes! I don't like smarties like you. Mr. Doinel? I'm sorry to call during your meeting. You'll have to come upstairs. I got a surprise for you... but not a nice one! Don't touch that hat! You think I'm takin' ya to a party? The joke's over! Your ma and I wanna be able to sleep nights. Take a good look at your pal. You won't see him for a while! Maybe this'll set your head right. It can't go on like this! If I'd done this, my dad would've laid me flat. Is the captain in? We've tried everything... kindness, persuasion, punishment... but we've never beaten him! At times the good old methods... Yes, but we're not like that. - We left him free. - Maybe too free! I wouldn't say so. But since we both work, you know how it is. Yes, I'm a father too. At times it's hard to know what to do. If only he'd confide in us! We talk to him, his mind's elsewhere. You think he's listening? Look how I found him! Who knows what's on his mind? Cabanel! Please take this boy's statement. - Vagrancy and theft! - Right, boss. Come on! So what's your decision? For now, we can't have him at home. He'd run off again. If you could put him somewhere under surveillance... like in the country and put him to work. He won't do anything in school. We could try an Observation Center. They're well-organized now, with wood and metal workshops. That would do him good. If they have room! You'll have ask for a paternal correction. So Probational Education can take charge of him. He'll go before the juvenile court judge tomorrow. You or your wife should be there. Alright! - Anyone see you enter the building? - No. ...hereby... declares he entered the building surreptitiously... ...one typewriter. Sign here. - Charles! - Yeah? He's yours. Come on. That way! - He's yours. I'm goin' home. - OK. - What'd you do? - Ran away from home. And you? Me... The gals're here! I've seen cleaner precincts in movies. I've seen dirtier. I've seen cheerier! Move! The chariot's here! Put on your jacket! Tie, belt, shoelaces... Empty your pockets! Sign there! Sign here. We could try taking him back but... he'd have to promise to change completely. If you could frighten him... That's not my role. We've no control over him! Maybe you try to control him only intermittently. Is the boy often left alone on the weekends... at home? My husband belongs to a car racing club. So we sometimes leave the boy at home. But he hates sports! He prefers going... to movies and ruining his eyes. And your husband? He's his son! No. He married me when the boy was a baby. Very honorable. I shouldn't have said that. On the contrary! I think it's best we send the boy... to an observation center. One near the seashore? We don't run vacation camps! I'll do my best with whatever is available. We'll keep him 2 or 3 months while I investigate his case. Then we'll reach a decision. This processing is bound to do him good. - Goodbye, Judge. - Goodbye, Madam. Juvenile Delinquency Center - What're you in for? - And you? - I slipped up. - I swiped a typewriter. A typewriter? Not very bright! They've all got serial numbers. See that big guy? He swiped automobile tires. At home everytime I'd cry... my dad would imitate my crying with his violin... just to tease me. One day I got fed up and I slugged him! I'd kill my old man if he did that. Who's that guy? He ran away last week. He got caught. Running away's not forbidden, but getting caught is! What's going on? Line up! What're you up to? Show me your bread! Alright... You bit into yours! Bring your bread and dish over here. Left or right? Quiet! I bet you'd get caught and I won! I don't care! For 5 days I had so much fun... I'll do it again first chance I get. What're you up to? Kanayan! To the psychologist! If she drops a pencil, pick it up... without looking at her legs or it'll go in your file. - What file? - It says what they think of you... the judge, doctor, even your parents' neighbors. I know my file by heart. I'm psychomotorally unstable with perverse tendencies. What if I say some nonsense? You'll go to the booby hatch and that'll send you around the bend! Why'd you return the typewriter? I couldn't sell it. I didn't know what to do. I was scared... so I took it back. I don't know why. And you stole 10,000 francs from your grandmother? She asked me over for her birthday. She was old and didn't eat much. She hung on to her money but didn't need it. She was gonna die. I knew the hiding place so I swiped some. I knew she'd never miss it. And she never did! She gave me a very nice book that day. My mother would always go through my pockets and... my pants were on the bed that night... so she came in and swiped the money... 'cause the next day it was gone. Then she made me confess I'd taken it from my grandma. So she took away the book Grandma had given me. One day I asked to read it and... found out she'd sold it. Your parents say you always lie. I lie... once in a while. At times, if I told the truth they wouldn't believe me! So I tell lies. Why don't you love your mother? At first I was placed with a foster mother. When the money ran out, I went to Grandma's. Then she got old and couldn't keep me so... I went to live with my folks but I was already 8. I realized Mom didn't like me much. She'd nag at me for little insignificant things. Then there were fights at home. I heard... that when my mother had me she was a bachelor mother. Once she fought with Grandma and I found out... she wanted an abortion. So I was born thanks to Grandma. Have you ever slept with a girl? No, but I know some pals who have and they said... if I really wanted to, I should go to rue St-Denis. So I went and... asked a few girls and they gave me hell. I got scared and left. But I went back a few times. A guy noticed me in the street and said What're you doin' here? He was a North African. I explained and he said he knew one who'd go... with young guys and all that. He took me to her hotel... but she wasn't there that day. We waited an hour or 2... then I left. No, I came alone. That way? Your personal letter hurt your father a lot. You're naïve to think he wouldn't show it to me. In spite of things we're a solid couple. I've known hard times but it wasn't smart to remind him about it. Didn't he give you a name? We were ready... to take you back home but now it's impossible... due to the gossip and your talk to the neighbors. I didn't say a thing! But I'm used to it! I've had idiots attacking me all my life. That's all I have to say to you. Don't play the martyr! Your father says he doesn't care what happens to you. You can go to a trade school. You wanted a job? You'll see how much fun a foundry can be!
