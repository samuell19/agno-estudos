This was one case... out of about seven million a year. I haven't seen it all yet, but... this one still seemed different. Maybe it was how far it went. Now, you never know how these situations if they will end in violence. But that threat of harm, that terror that the victim is made to live with, that's always there.

I'm gonna be right there. Don't call Cherise or anything else. I'm sorry, Chief Dodd. I'm at your mercy again. - Oh, you're not Chief Dodd. - Nope. - Officer Barragan. - Officer Barragan. - Right. You're the new guy. - Mm-hmm. So you're probably not gonna let me off with my usual warning then, right? 'Cause, I mean, why would you? You know how fast you were going? - Too fast? - Too fast. And you were talking on your cell phone. Mm. Where you headed in such a hurry? Uh, the James' Center. - I work there. - Oh, okay. - Yeah. - Where is that? It's right up the corner. I'm headed to work. Okay. Good to know. We have the world's best pie. Also good to know. All right, Julie. How did, how do you know my name? Well, chief, he, uh, gave me a heads-up on some of the town's more reckless citizens and their routes. I was expecting you. So, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do what the chief would do here. Julie Dillon, consider this a verbal warning. Well, thank you, sir. You're welcome. Just do me a favor, slow down, keep both hands on the wheel. If you're not careful, you'll fly into a ditch or kill somebody. I promise you, I will do neither of those things. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. ...two, two and a... Two, ten and twelve...

So, since Tommy can't get it together, hash browns and toast on him, coffee's on me. - Thank you. - Hey! - At least I was on time, okay? - Ha-ha. - Good morning, Evelyn. - Hey. - What do you have for me? - Uh... Let me see here. Ah! Okay. A ten-letter word for "freedom." The, the third letter's a B. Liberation? Look at you. You are ready for college. Even though you can leave the rest of us behind, it's fine. I may be "liberated" from this town, but I could never leave you. Mm. By the way, there's some extra in there this week. I won 50 bucks in the scratch-off. I can't take that. Yes, you can, and you will. Go. Go. So, I don't know what you're up to tonight but, um... so, me and the boys are heading to Lucky's to play some pool and... I don't know if you... want to go. That's nice. Sounds fun. Sensing a "but" coming on its way. It's inappropriate to talk about "butts" in the workplace. What? No... No, no, no. I-I wasn't-- Gotcha. Um, I can't tonight. I have a thing with Kinsey and Suzanne and... Lucky's sounds fun though. Cool. That's, uh... That's awesome. Maybe another time. I like pool. [indistinct song Hello, Officer Barragan. Don't tell me that you changed your mind about letting me go. - Am I under arrest? - Nope. While you are clearly a danger to yourself and others, I'm just here to inspect the pie, ma'am. It is really good. I'll be the judge of that. Do you have a preference? I'll have whatever you think I should have. Coming right up. So... with you being new in town and all, I figured you might want somebody to... I don't know, show you around? Are you asking me out on a date, Julie Dillon? Friday night. I don't know. A criminal and a cop? - People might talk. Let 'em. Friday night. Yeah, we were close. But, you know, when, when David showed up, it... changed things. How so? I, you know, I just felt things were different. She liked him, and what do I know? She was happy. Did you like her? I mean, who didn't like Julie? - Hey! I'm so sorry. - Hey-hey! I couldn't get my till to close out at work and it was this whole thing, so... We'll see if I have a job tomorrow. I am sure you're fine. Got you little somethin'. Doesn't look like much but, uh, turn that, that's that, yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Isn't that the guy you work with? Yeah. He was watching you during the show, you know? - Pretty intense. - Well, that's just Tommy. - Just Tommy, huh? Yeah. Now, where were we? No, but, you don't like him, right? What? No! God, no. 'Cause I like you, Julie. I do. Yeah? But do you "like me" like me? I just said I like you. Wait, are you letting me in here? Uh... Look, my last relationship was really dysfunctional. - So... - Someone from around here? No. Uh, East Larson. Where I used to live. Oh. What's her name? Alicia. But I don't wanna talk about her. David, I'm not her. I know. I just wanna be... open about everything. You know, this, whatever this is, I... I want it to be right. I don't know what to say. I like you. You know... Navajo myth talks about resisting meanness. That was Julie growing up. Not a mean bone in her. Did she date a lot before this happened? I was always happy when she found someone. Truly. For the first time since her father died, her life was in perfect harmony. - And he was like-- - Okay, okay. - N-n-no, don't say it. - No, no, no, no... And he was just like, "Today, I want whatever you think I should have." - Oh! So I brought him the lemon meringue pie. - That was some good pie. - I think that's sweet. I'm happy to see that Julie's finally with a guy who respects her opinion. Ay, Mom, can we please not talk about that? Who is this? Nobody. It's... Just forget about it. He just wasn't right for you. - Sorry, David. - No, no. I can handle it. Guess I'll just have to step up my game. I guess you will. - Where are we? - Trust me. It's worth the drive. Wow, this place is amazing. Is this real? You bet. It's my grandfather's old hunting rifle. Wow. Huh. Here. Oh. Spilled some. One second. Everything in here is so masculine. It makes me wanna wear flannel and chop down trees. I could see that. The sexiest lumberjack to ever walk these woods. Oh! Is this you? It is! You were adorable. Oh, I can't believe that you were right here, and I never met you. - What? - Nothing. What is it? I'm really happy with you. Seeing these photos, it always reminds me of them. What? Your parents? They look nice. Yeah. I didn't mean to pry. No, it's, it's okay. Is this at the cabin? Yeah. My mom stopped coming a couple years after this, but my dad and I came every summer. Spend some time with the chief and his family... till my dad died. I'm sorry. My dad was the best. After he died, my mom kinda checked out, but she'd still send me up here to spend time with the chief and his family. Get rid of me for the summer. - Chief Dodd? - Yeah. Then when she passed, the cabin went to me. Here we are. Thank you for telling me that. Thank you for listening. - Oh. - Who's that? I'm sorry. I didn't know that was in there. Is that... her? Uh, Alicia? It is, right? Look, it's okay. Everybody has stuff in their past. Even the sexiest lumberjack to walk these woods has made a mistake or two. She was definitely a mistake. Things didn't end well for us. She was hung up on somebody else the whole time we were dating. It messed me up. You know what's not a mistake? What's that? This beer... this boy... and this place. I guess it is pretty good. You know, you never gave me a tour. - I can do that. - Actually, no. - Feeling a little dizzy. - Okay. Think I might need to lie down, if that's okay. - Okay. - If that's okay. Well, if you're dizzy, come here, lumberjane. - Whoa! - Take you in here. Coldwater Hills is a small town. A town where everyone knows everyone. Anytown, USA? That depends on where you grew up. You know, it's as messed up as, as any town. You know, if you change your mind and wanted to do an Xbox and beer night, the offer still stands. Just two friends on a very platonic, non-weird, not-at-all-awkward hangout sesh, okay? Thank you. Have a good night. Julie. Hey. Hi! Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you got off work at 4:00. Yeah, but, like, how did you get in? I was worried about you, so I wanted to stop by. Oh. Yeah, I just had to deposit something before the bank closed. Um... I think we need to talk about Tommy. Okay, what about him? I think you need to keep an eye on him. Something about him just doesn't feel right. I wanted to make sure you were okay. - Yes. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm, I'm good. - Good. Oh. Well, hello. What a nice surprise. Thank you, David. - What are you kids up to? - Uh, I just got home. Yeah, we're just gonna make plans later. Right? Wanna take this all the way to the kitchen for me? - I think I could do that. - Thank you. All right. Did you ever say anything to her? About David? No. No, never. It was never my place. Do you wish you had? I think, I think she figured that out eventually. Hey, thanks for, uh, watching the little rugrat tonight. Hope I'm not keeping you from your own scandalous pursuits with David. Gosh. I'm just lucky to have some time with this little one. You okay, kiddo? She's been this little ray of sunshine all day. And here's the fun part-- no explanation. Yay! Did something happen? Mm, this boy at school is mean. He said I threw a rock, but I didn't throw a rock. No one believed me, they all believed him. - He always lies. - Who threw a rock? - Hey, you're not here, remember? - Fine. Not here. But I'll find out. Okay. Listen to me. Sometimes a boy like that, a boy who lies really well, no matter what, people are gonna believe him and not you. But, see, sooner or later, the truth is gonna come out because it always does. - Really? - Really. So someday you're gonna be able to look him in the eyes and say, "All the people that you fooled, they know that you are lying and they know I'm telling the truth." And that's gonna be super awesome. Awesome. Nice job stealing my parenting thunder. Okay. All right, kids. I'm out. - Have fun, Mommy. - I will. I love you. - Muah! I will. - Have fun. - Stay out as late as you want. - Oh! Okay.

Hey, why don't you go to bed, sweetie? I'll tuck you in in a second. What the hell is going on? - Everybody's been worried sick. - Everybody? What are you talking about? I thought we were supposed to be together tonight. - Oh, we had talked about it. - Yeah, we had talked about it. So when I didn't hear from you, I started to worry. And then I called your mother. My mother? What does my mother have to do with this? She said you would be here. But we couldn't reach you, so here I am. Is your phone off or something? Okay. Just come inside. How many times have you called and texted me? I was trying to get in touch with you, okay? When I didn't hear back, I-it made it worse. My mom has been calling me all night? You made us all very concerned about you. I'm babysitting for my best friend. Well, it would've been nice to know that. Anything could've happened to you. When you didn't answer, I, I thought maybe that Tommy-- My phone ringer is off. That's not a crime. Hm... I always wanna be able to find you. - Why? - Why? - Hey, guys, what's up? Hey. Do you mind giving us a minute? We just really need to sort some things out. - No, I don't think so. - I... Okay. Then, then come with me. - No, I have to finish up here. - Mommy! Julie, look. Please. - I think you should just go. - Julie, stop. Okay? Think for a second. Think about what you're doing. - You just slow down. - Hold on, okay? Julie, just... Let's, let's start over. We can talk about it. But not right now, and really, really not here. Come on. Good night. Yeah, I guess I'm the brassy best friend. Straight talk. I take zero crap. Julie... not so much. And I'll never forgive myself for not pushing her to see it for what it was. I can't tell you how much I need this girls' night. Have you heard from him? He's being really sweet. He sent me flowers. Ah. I... feel bad, like... you know, maybe I screwed up. It was not your fault, my little Indian princess, at all. So don't worry about it. He's been texting me. I think maybe I should hear him out. What do you... think he's thinking? You don't want my opinion on that. Okay. It was a bit much for me. That's all I'm gonna say. And be smart. Yeah. I just think, you know, maybe, like, he was having a bad day or... there could've been something going on. Julie. Just wanted to talk. I wanted to explain the other night. Okay. I don't think you understand how much I care about you. I think about you all the time. Start over. Prove to you how much I care about you. Maybe we can go back out to the cabin again? - David-- - Or... have a date night? I, uh... David, just don't. You promised me we would talk. We will, just not... right now and not here, right now-- - Were you lying to me? - No. - No. Do you still wanna be with me? - Because... - Yeah. I think there is something powerful between us. And I know we're supposed to be together, you know? I just need you to understand me the way I understand you. - Yeah. - We all make mistakes. We occasionally hurt those that we love the most. I need you to know that I'm hurt. Okay. I understand... Good. Good. I'm glad we talked. Please just keep this little misunderstanding between us. In a town like this, people get the wrong idea. They start to talk. But this is just between us, okay? You look like a scared rabbit. Look, I'll, uh... I'll leave you alone. But we'll talk soon. Okay? I'll call you?

I ask you to extend him every courtesy that you would me. Sergeant Miller. Thank you, Chief. First, we need to set up a timeline. Who saw her last? Has she made any phone calls? Her body missing from the scene of the accident suggests suspicious circumstances. Does she have any known enemies? Significant other? Ex? Anybody that would wanna wish her harm. Anybody she's had trouble with. Anything. What am I missing here? Okay. I've got nothing to hide. How many reports had to be made before you take this seriously? Well, first of all, this girl, she's known to exaggerate. Look at what we have. We have her car, busted up in a ditch covered in alcohol, and her gone from the scene. How does that implicate Officer Barragan? Look, all I know is that if he's part of this, he has anything to do with her disappearance, the accident, anything, that's gonna come back on you hard. If you're implying that I'm somehow to blame for any of this... I'm not implying anything. Just considering the facts. Yeah, well, consider this. This is my goddamn case, Sergeant Miller. I'm willing to work with you here, but I suggest you mind your tone. You're right. Your town. - Those are the rules. - Thank you. Don't mind me if I keep an eye on that kid. Do whatever makes you feel helpful. I'm gonna send my guys out to Stanton Farm, we're gonna work our way out from there. Soon as we cross the town line, I'll be sure and let you know. Thanks for stopping by. Once upon a time, in a distant land, there was nothing but darkness, until... Changing Woman. Every year, Changing Woman was born in the spring, died in winter, and magically was reborn again in the spring. Changing Woman had...? Twins. That's right. Twin children... born with special powers. When they were older, the twins set out to find their father, who was the shining sun above. On their dangerous journey, they met Spider Woman, who protected and guided them along the way. When they reached their father, he knew that they were his children, and he told them all about the monsters. Bringers of chaos. So, when the monsters come... we can seek the power to destroy them by saying to the sun, "Give me the light of your mind, that my mind may be strong. Give me some of your strength, that my arm may be strong." Are you okay, baby? - Hm? - Yeah. Yeah, I... Sorry, just, uh, just a dream. Just, um... I've got a lot on my mind with all this... - Hope I didn't scare you. - No. No, I'm, I'm good. I'm... I'm really, really good, actually. Is that terrible? Just... I don't know, I just... I feel like you were brought here for a reason. You know? Like this was meant to be. N-not Julie going missing, of course, but... I don't know, me working at the station, and you knowing the chief. He's always been there for me. So many people have deserted me, but through the hardest parts of my life, he has been there. Baby, I'm here. Right? I know. Yeah, um... No, I just... I just want to... make him proud, you know? Feel I owe that to him. I know, I know he's proud of you. I see it in his eyes. And I am, too. No matter what. What do you mean, "No matter what?" I mean, David, we... we both know you weren't with me Friday night. Where were you? Do you really want to know? I went to get something for you. Something that I think you will like. Um... - But if you want me to-- - No, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, don't you dare tell me. You just... You just wait until you are good and ready. 'Cause I am right here. And I've got something for you, too, if that's okay. - Sgt. Miller? - Mrs. Dillon, yes? She's still alive. - Excuse me? - My daughter is still alive. I heard her. I heard her voice. Mrs. Dillon, our minds can play all kinds of tricks on us when we're in distress. - No. - Yes. I've seen it before. No, it was no trick. I heard her as clear as I'm hearing you. She's out there somewhere. She's alive, and she's waiting to be found. So, please, go find her. I wanted to be with you, Julie. I really did. But if I can't have you, nobody will! Do you hear me? I don't know where you went, but I will find you. Sgt. Miller. What are you doing here? Well, I could ask you the same thing. Everybody's out near Stanton Farm. Yeah, I just remembered Julie loved coming out here. Came out here to think, get her head clear. Thought maybe I could come out here and find something. Seemed like a good idea. So, did you do it? Do what? Did you find anything? No. Nothing. Sure is pretty, though. Quiet, too. So far away from everything. Yeah. I got a cabin up here. Been coming for years. I know the area well. I'll head back, grab the dogs, get them back out here. No, don't bother. This is not local jurisdiction. Oh, it's not a bother. Anything for Julie. No, seriously, I got this area covered. You should head back to town. All hands on deck. All hands on deck. At about that time, the two boys came forward. They'd, they'd seen Julie in a, well, in-in a truck that we thought could've been David's truck heading out to where Sgt. Miller found David poking around. But you weren't so sure at the time? Look, being police means you have to take every lead seriously. And, uh, it's also my job as chief to be skeptical of pretty much everyone I come into contact with. But, uh... sometimes... sometimes you just don't see things as clearly... as you'd like. David, it's me. David? So, did they talk to you? Yeah, they talked to me. I think I was the last one to talk to Julie, so they had a lot of questions for me. Who did you talk to? Chief Dodd. Who else? I told him what I knew, and he did nothing with it. Thank God Miller was around. At least someone with some sense that people could talk to. And when I, when I talked to him, I told him. Told him what? That Julie had called me about Alicia. David is missing. Are you saying this girl Julie, she might actually be alive? I don't know, but... if she is alive, she probably needs our help, so... finding him is our best shot at finding her. You're gonna catch him, though. That's the plan. I mean, something like this... If you, if you catch him... If he gets locked up, does he stay locked up? I mean... I don't know, man. Alicia... are you worried that if you help me here, he's gonna come for you? Look, if you can help us, we'll do everything we can to keep you safe. But we're up against it here, Alicia. If you know anything about where he might be hiding, where he might have gone... I'm trying to think. I just-- Alicia, he very well may have killed this girl. Help us find him. Help us find her. I'll be right back. What is this? He took me there a couple of times. It's outside of town. He said he had a cabin out near Kettle Woods. Is this it? - Alicia... please. You have to promise me that I'm gonna be safe. - I-I'll do everything in my-- - No, you have to promise me. I promise. Do you have a map? Look, I had nothing to do with it. Well, neither did I. Well, someone, whoever is trying to... frame me or take Julie, they're... They're trying to make me look like a crazy person, like a killer. David, do you think I'm stupid? I think you're amazing. But I do need your help with something. - I, uh... I'm gonna have to call you back. Sergeant... What's going on? What did these boys say? I heard David's missing. We don't have all the information yet. David just hadn't shown up the last day or so, but I may have a lead. - About Julie? - Well, no. But I may have found David. Who's there? Just show yourself. I promise to make it quick. David, get out here now. We gotta talk. - Shit. - David! - Shit. - Son. Please, just... come out here and talk to me, will you? I'm here. What the hell happened? If you're innocent here, David, this, this doesn't help. I didn't do anything. You have to know that. You're like family to me, kid. You know that. - You're like my own boy. - I know. That's why you're the only one who can help me here. Somebody is making it look like I'm doing all these things. I got a message from Sgt. Miller. He spoke to Suzanne, and Alicia. Yeah, well, they're all liars. It's a witch hunt. We don't even know what to say, David. They'll find you. That's, that's why I wanted to get to you first. Try to... talk some sense into you. Chief... Look. My father, he always trusted you-- Oh, cut the crap, David! Come on, let's... Just, just, just come with me, all right? We'll sort it all out. Now, come on. All right? Shh... Shh... You're a monster. And I would do it all again. Because I love you, Julie. Why would that be loaded? As long as I live, I'll never stop. Aah! When you work enough years on a job, you see all kinds of things. Terrible things. Beautiful things. And you just file it all away as much as you can and move on. But what I saw that morning... that's gonna stick with me for the rest of my life. Julie! There she was. Alive. My little girl. Our children are bound to us. We're tied. Uh... Maybe someone was watching over her. Giving her strength. Reminding her of what she had to live for. I mean... we all knew Julie was special. Here's what I know. I know a young woman was shot and left out in the middle of nowhere for three days. And somehow... somehow she... got up. There is no logical reason why my girl Julie Dillon is alive today. None. And yet, she is. And yet, I am.
