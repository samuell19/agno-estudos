We're on site at the perimeter. Clear the area, light civilian activity, be aware of remaining stragglers after last nights skirmish. Copy. Hear that? Scout, check it out. Sergeant Barnes, please rise. After a thorough review of facts in this case, this court has reached its conclusion. You got eyes on Sarge...? I see you Jimmy. Tell the kid to put the gun down right now! Put the gun down on the ground now, slowly, now It's my fathers gun. What is he saying? It's his fathers gun, he doesn't want to put it down. He has to put it down or someone's going to get hurt. Tell him! I have to honor my father's memory, I cannot leave his gun here. Lower the gun now or they will shoot. I must take it home with me. Tell the kid to put the gun down now! I have to honor my fathers memory, he died here, I cannot put his gun on the ground. Put it down now, they're going to shoot you. What's happening Sarge! Lost in translation, hold your positions! Hold your fire! Under your command innocent civilian lives were lost. United States military has a zero-tolerance policy pertaining to the unsanctioned collateral damage of civilians on the battlefield. Therefore you and the members of your unit are hereby found guilty of all the charges brought against you. You'll be discharged from your post and stripped of all rank and benefits associated with it. What the fuck did you do? He had a weapon and they were hiding right behind that dune... I take no pleasure in reading this verdict, but you should be thankful that your actions have not damaged our trust and nation building efforts in the Middle East. They were gonna kill me. We'll bury him here and no one will fucking know. He's just a kid. He's a fucking kid, Jesus fucking Christ. Sarge... Sarge. Congressman Ambrose, do you have a closing statement? Yes I do, thank you your honor. As a ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have many thoughts on this case, but only one thing to say... I'm calling it in. Base. Go for base. Come in... go for base.. - Sgt. Barnes... - What's your call sign? Thank you for your service as an Army Ranger in operation Clear Freedom in Faryab Province, Afghanistan. That's all, your honor. Staff Sergeant Barnes, you are now dismissed. We'd be wise not to appeal. Says who? Uncle Sam. I mean, you still have dental through the VA. People kill for dental. People kill for dental? Can you please kindly get the fuck away from me. Did you hear me? - Hey Barnes. - Disappear. You look like you could use a cup of coffee. - Aren't you the guy that's... - The only one fighting for you. That's what you were going to say, right? Nah. Well, good thing I said it for you. Hey, let's take a walk. There's too many ears around here. Yeah, I can use a fucking walk. I think we can both agree that you got fucked in there. - Mm hmm. - Off the record, of course. Look... look you're not the first to be sacrificed to save face... Right now there's not much I can do about that. But I will help you in any way I can, I give you my word. Yeah, I've heard that before. Not from me you haven't. And I wouldn't appeal if I were you, all right. Let sleeping dogs lie. You're not going to further your cause in that court. Yeah. Slogans from politicians, it's unique. I'll level with you. My uncle served in Nam, when he came back, he was a ghost. Society had no use for him so he took his own life. And I won't let that happen to our troops ever again. Come on, get you a cup of coffee. How do you take it? Black. Come on. America, welcome to . I'm your host... Hi honey, is that you? Who else would it be, mama? You're home early. Yeah boss let me out, Just go wash my hands. You want me to fix you something to eat? Nah, it's all right Ma, I'll figure something out. Ma. Now you know that I can go out and and get some more milk if you'd like. What are you doing up Ma? Hey, hey, hey, hey... See you know what your problem is? Hmm. So used to doing things on your own. Mm hmm. What am I here for? How about I go out and get us some milk? Sounds good. Office of Congressman Dakota Ambrose, how may I help you? Reginald Barnes, Sergeant Retired for Congressman Dakota. One moment please. Well your vote will get us past committee and that moves the ball forward, so what do you say, do we have your support? Sorry to hear that, congressman. I'll have to get it done without you. Yeah. Come in. The call came in. All right, well, send everyone home early. Cancel the cleaning crew and schedule him for five PM. Okay, I'll arrange everything. Okay. Oh and... find my brother. I have no idea where he is. Thank you for sharing. We're only as sick as our secrets. Anyone else like to share? Anyone? Seth, anything you'd like to share? The floor is yours. Hello. My name is Seth and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi Seth.. - Hi Seth. It's... Been a rough week for me. I... Actually I don't think I'm ready to share. I'm sorry, you guys. - Thank you Seth. - It's okay. That's okay. One day at a Time, Seth. I appreciate you. Anyone else? Anyone have that burning desire they'd like to share? I'll share. Hello, my name is Dani and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi Dani.. - Hi Dani. Man it's been a minute since I shared, also had a rough week, also though a good week, I got to see my kids again, Yup. My husband... ex-husband, excuse me, he's a... sorry, excuse me, he's finally agreed to let me see my kids more now so... they're everything to me. Him and I have had the most difficult times communicating in the past and I just have to remind myself to... to just not drink my way through it. And I just find a lot of comfort and grace in this room and thank you guys all so much for that, and thank you so much for letting me share. - Thank you Dani. - Thank you Dani. Anyone else, anyone... Hey Seth, hey, can you hold up a second? What's up? Nah, it's just I haven't seen you in a couple of meetings. Everything okay? Yeah, just had a bunch of stuff come up recently. Oh. Anniversary of a friend who didn't make it. You know, brings up a... a lot of shit. Yeah, I know. I mean, I know what you mean. - Yeah. - Sucks. I wrote my number down for you. If you ever wanted to give me a call, you need someone to talk to. I mean, I already have a sponsor. It's just for an extra set of ears to listen. Okay. Yeah I will. Thanks. You're going to come with us to the diner? I gotta get going but maybe next time? - All right. - All right. Don't forget your lighter. Thanks. - Take care. - You too. Lady out front, you know, she told me to come in here and wait so... Well it looks like you're off to a good start to me, Sergeant Barnes. You know, I gotta be honest with you. After all the letters we sent went unanswered, I was beginning to think we'd never see you in here. Glad you decided to show. - Yeah. - Can I get you something? Cup of coffee? Black, right? Ann, can I get two cups of black coffee in here, please. I'd ask how you are holding up, but that would imply I don't already know. A man of your talents and skill set should never be under-employed living in a one-bedroom apartment with his sick mom. What the fuck you know about my life? Well I do know that as a result of your conviction, my esteemed colleagues were able to pass a 250 million dollar appropriations bill that redirected critical VA funds into more important projects like re-sanding our nation's beaches. Conversely, since your dishonorable discharge, the only job you've been able to get is a minimum wage warehouse position. What's this about? It's an opportunity. Take a look at that, say what you think. - Thanks Ann. - Of course. What the fuck is all this about? Right and wrong, good and evil, pure evil. See, one of the files in that folder represents a choice, the other is involuntary. You had no more control over that battlefield than you do over the weather. But the man in that other file, he made a choice a long time ago to do harm to the most vulnerable amongst us, and he's still out there to this day doing it. Sir, your wife is on the line. Tell her I'll call her back from the car. Just when I thought I was done with all this bureaucratic red tape bullshit, someone like you comes back in my life and gives me a reason to remain in public office. We can really make a difference together. We? I don't remember working for you. Not yet but that's what I'm trying to remedy here. Look, I know I've failed you in the past, all right? I admit that. But this is a chance for redemption for both of us. Take the folder, see how it makes you feel, my brother Seth will be in touch shortly. Okay? I'd like to thank you for your continued service, Sergeant Barnes. - Seth. - How'd it go? Good, I guess. First contact? Give it two days and let it sit till then, all right. All right. All right, talk to you soon. Oh, he's here right now, I'll call you back. Congressman. Hello. Great to see you again. Great to see you. And please keep up the good work. I will. Do you know her? Yeah, you know I have a thing for older women. No, she's like a donor or something. The usual? - Yes, scotch neat, thanks. - Of course. You look fantastic, Sorry I'm late. I got hung up at work. Is everything okay? Yeah it's good, different, interesting. How was your day? Well good, interesting, different. Jenny's soccer game was today? She quit soccer two weeks ago. When did she? She wants to do ballet now. Really? We're ready to order. Cool looking car. Thanks. Seth. Barnes. You know, I pictured you differently. You talked to my brother. Mm hmm. So you know he wants to bring you in on this thing we're starting right? Yeah. So I don't have to tell you this but the world's got a fuckin' problem. Okay. Are you familiar with Theseus? No. Greek mythology. You know the Minotaur? Yeah that's the thing with the horns. Yeah the thing with the horns, Theseus killed it. He acquired great power, vast wealth, he even became king. Rather than keep it all to himself he gave it back to the people, form what was the start of democracy. It's a cool story, man. Theseus got me off the drink. Theseus made people like my brother want to become politicians and change the world. Theseus is you. Look man I only got a few minutes before I go back inside. You trying to tell me you want me to kill people for you? No, just the Minotaurs. You kept the file and the money, right? Yeah I got it. Look it over again, I'll come for your answer tonight. Yeah I know my answer. Give it a little more time. Think about Theseus. This is bigger than all of us. Tonight. Baby, could you do me a favor and bring me my pink pills, two of them. - Pink right? - Pink. You're such an angel. - Ma. - Hmm. I'm gonna step out for a moment, okay. Mm hmm. Do me a favor, don't watch too much of that TV, you know, it does things to you. You try and be quiet when you get back, I'll be in the bed. I will, I promise. Hop in. Where we going? Look it's cold. Hop in, let's go for a drive. Come on. Where to? New York City. New York? Only the most beautiful illusion in the world. Billionaires, junkies, homeless, all on an island you gotta pay sixteen dollars to get into. You know the only thing separating the homeless guy from the CEO living in a penthouse? It's the fucking elevator. We fix what we can. I've already tried, man. Four tours... look at me now. Look, if you're feeling sorry for yourself maybe you're not the guy my brother thinks you are. Hey, you see this spot right here, pull over... yeah, I'll get out here. Hey, glove-box. That's for you. Or not, choice is yours. Is that a yes? Let me get a beer, whatever you got on tap. Why the fuck were they out here at the first place? We can bury him here and no one will ever know. We can't cover this, man. Use your head. Did you pick him up? About fifteen minutes ago. Where is he? - I'm waiting outside. - Outside? He went into a bar. Well, you going in after him? No. Where's his head at? I'm gonna let him figure it out. Okay, let me know once it's confirmed. Yeah, all right, will do. Gotta go, I'm back on. You waiting for me? Why didn't you come inside? I go in there, I drink, I drink it all. I'll do it. I'll take you home. Tomorrow we'll go see my brother. Thank you for making the right decision here. Feels like the choice was yours. Nah, you always have a choice. Until you don't. Outside of your court martial, there's no memory of who you are, the sacrifices you made. You're a shadow, which makes you perfect for this. So if you're really ready, my brother and I will make sure you're well compensated for your services here. You still have the file? You know what needs to be done. Then let's get to work. Oh and... toss that in your pocket. Emergencies only. Jeez, you startled me. There's a blue jay, just beyond that cluster. It's beautiful. I got some great shots of that guy the other day, gorgeous. Can I see them? Yeah. Look at that. Fantastic. Nice, ain't he? Love it. Shh. Don't move. You hear me? You hear me clearly? Yeah. Now, walk. Turn around, have a seat. Please, I don't know what this is. Take whatever you want. My camera, my wallet. I don't want anything from you. This is for what you do to little kids. I'll disappear, I promise. You don't have to do this. I know a lot of people, bad people, you don't have to do this to me, trust me. I'll go far, far away, I got a problem. That's yours, not mine. You need a light? Excuse me. Light for your cigarette. Sure. There you go. Mind? Sure. Thank you. No prob. Bad habit, you know. I suppose. It's not your only bad habit, is it? Excuse me? So from a holistic point of view, federally, Honey, There's an oversight going on, and how do we... Can you turn the volume up on the TV, I can't hear a thing. Local organizations with some national support. Thank you. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said in 2019 they reported more than 421,000 missing children to the FBI. - What is the biggest factor - Horrible... behind these trafficking rings? Horrible. Look, it's different... How them new meds working for you, Ma? They made me feel a bit foggy but... then sometimes I can... remember clearly. The doctor said they'd make you a bit sleepy. Yeah they do, But funny, I can see Diane's face sometimes so clearly. You know, she never liked peaches. Something about them, and she'd start scratching her arms. Do you remember? Nah, Ma, I was a little bit too young for that. You followed her around her like a lost puppy. I know, that part I remember. She couldn't go anywhere without you by her side. Breaks my heart... when I hear about missing children on the news. People never recover. Need a blanket Ma? I'll get you another one. No.. In local news, residents are still on edge... No this is fine. As a series of unsolved gangland style murders continues. Another body with bullet wounds was discovered earlier today at Palisades State Park as police continue to follow leads Mr. Yost? And investigate. Who's asking? I was told you was the guy to see about a straight six engine. Maybe. Depends on what you're driving. Oh, well my pops gave me his old ride. I keep it in the garage. You know, beautiful cherry red ninety two impala. Decided, you know, do a little work on it. You sure about that? Because... they stopped making the straight six in ninety. Is that right? You don't even know what you're driving. Who was it you said referred you to me? Ah, shit. - Sergeant Barnes. - Seth. Dakota. Outstanding work, you've been more effective then we could've imagined. But... on this next one we're gonna need you to... go a little further. What does that mean? What my brother's trying to say is we're gonna need you to start working your way up the ladder. The ladder? I thought you guys had all the info. Not all of it. After a few names the trail goes cold. Look, listen, we need you to try to... squeeze... as much information as you can out of them, that way we can try to put the pieces together and figure out who's responsible for this. Yeah, you want me to squeeze some more info out of them, mm hmm, You all right? I need you guys to understand something. The service you ask for has to be on par with the money. Well if it's a pay increase you're looking for, we can handle that. Take care of yourself, Barnes. Doc, doc. Man, I appreciate you doing this for me, you know. Not a problem, all in a days work. Where is she? Yeah she's in the truck, you know, she's running a fever. It's like a 102. I'm just so worried about her. And what's your daughter's name again? - Betty. - Betty. Betty Hartley. Jesus, Jesus Christ. I don't know Betty, I swear I don't know her. Whatever this is, it wasn't me, please. That doesn't matter, doc. What matters is that you give me the names of the people that you're selling the footage to. I don't know, I don't know their names. Emory Bastile. Emory Bastile. What type of man steals the innocence of a child? I never touched Betty, I swear. I never touched her. You wouldn't lie to me would you? No. Yes. Can I help you? I want to know how you've been selling underage content for so long without so much as a warrant for your arrest. Don't do it. Nice. Tell your employees that they have the rest of the day off. Hello, thank you. Let everyone know they can take the rest of the day off. I'm closing up shop. Listen to me, I'm going to ask you a few questions, all right? And If you don't give me the answers I need, I'm gonna continue to hurt you, understood? Mm mm. - Understood? - Mm-hmm. Who do you work for? Man, I don't know. Who? Phala, man. Fucking Phala. Phala? His name is Phala, but they call him the boss. Where can I find him? You're putting me in the grave man. Where can I find him? He runs... an operation... for some heavy hitters out of his restaurant... on Green point and Huron in Brooklyn. Don't-no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen man, I'm just a courier, I'm a go between. I don't know what these guys are doing or selling, they use my servers for storage and uploads. I get a wire from the Ambrose Group every month. - The Ambrose group? - The Ambrose group. Good job. Good job, you did good, did real good. Okay, okay. After you're clean, after you're clean, bud. Beautiful isn't he? Is that the same one? Sure is. He looks healthier. Something wrong with him? Between his broken hoof and fractured hip, a lot, but he's doing good now. He looks strong. With the right support, care and nourishment anything is possible. We've been making a lot of progress, I mean... Yeah I know. People are beginning to notice, even the authorities. Yeah I've been tracking that. Then why'd you leave a witness behind? He wasn't part of it. And you made that assessment all on your own? I did. An intricate operation like this only works if all the pieces are in place. I don't care if they sweep the floor, if they're guilty we don't leave them breathing. That's big words coming from a man who's keeping his hands clean. We can't afford to get sloppy here. We all know how things turn out if that happens. Hey, he's on edge, Nah, don't make excuses for him. He's a grown man. All things considered, we lucked out with this guy. I mean, the demons he lives with... What, shit from over in the war? No, his psychological profile before he served. His father was killed in an accidental shooting, a friendly fire incident on base when he was ten. A year later when he was 11, his sister went missing. They found her body under an overpass. He never mentioned a sister to me. Maybe not. That's the real reason he's doing this. Kill me? C'mon, what's the matter with you kid? Why do you hurt little kids? Okay, I get it, I get it. Whoever sent you, I'll give you double what they gave you, right now. What do you know about the Ambrose group? Ambrose? Who the fuck is Ambrose? Are they the ones that sent you? Do you know who I am? Are you a fuckin' idiot? You're gonna fuck in kill me over a bunch of dirt faced kids? Yeah. Hey, come on outside to the front. All right. Give me a few, all right. Hop in. - Coffee's for you... - Thanks. Heard you like it black. Yup. Where we headed? Got to go pick up my brother. He's waiting for us. What are we doing here? Come on, let's go. We got something to show you inside. Think fast. The place is yours. My wife's involved in some real estate. We have a couple of these, rent 'em out. Should be plenty of space for you and your mom. There's an SUV in the garage. Registration is in your name, in the glove box. Sound like a good deal to you? Yeah. Sounds like a hell of a deal. Seth, enlighten us. Expansion. Jeff Douglass, right here in the Garden State. Are you serious? You guys have been doing your homework. Mm-hmm. Good man there. Yeah, we want you to recruit him. Okay. Look, you served with him. You know him better than anyone. So, of course we want your input, but we think he's perfect. Oh, yeah. Show him the target. Wait Hold your position, Scout. Lost in translation This can't be real. Is this legit? It's confirmed. Nah, nah, no way, man. What happened to your arm? The mark returned fire. Did you see a doctor? Yeah, me. You all right? That's our guy right there. Stay in the car. Hey there, private. Barnes, fuck whoa. What are you doing here? I could ask you the same. You look good. It's been what, like a year? Yeah, it's been about a year, man. So what have you been up to, huh? I'm busting my ass six days a week here, what do you think, you know. Yeah, I've been doing the same. Fucking dishonorable moniker following me around, doesn't help right? Yeah. I'm making ends meet though. You looking for work? Nah. Actually it's the opposite, something specific. Remember that thing we talked about back in the day up in the Faryab Province? You serious? It's covert. Pays real money, you know, a lot better than this bullshit. Using your skill set. Real people. How about we talk about this in the car? You know, a lot of eyes and ears around here. Gimme a minute. Let me just tell my foreman I'm gonna take a break. Jackie. Yeah. I'm gonna take a quick break. I'll be right back. All right, you got it. We're on in five. All right. Mr. Douglass. Mr. Douglass was my father. Fair enough. Jeff, this is Seth. You have a driver now, Barnes? Oh no, I'm not a driver... Relax, I'm just kidding. I take it Barnes brought you up to speed in what we're trying to get done here right? Well, not really. But I'll tell you this. I'd follow this man right here anywhere. Jeff's a specialist, rifle. Sniper? That's correct, sniper. This you? Yeah that's me. What step you on? Step two. Working them over again. We came to be aware that a power greater than ourselves can restore us to sanity. Sniper rifle, huh? Yeah. So you guys gonna tell me what we're doing? Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get in here. Hey. What's up, brother? You better watch yourself. This is your house? Yeah. You robbing banks too? Ay, after you get fucked, you got to find a way, right? She's on the table. Can I, Can I get you... Shh... Jeff, we're doing some important work here. You know. This ain't some gun for hire one for done bullshit. I'm here. Yeah. What is that? It's a Remington M twenty four sniper rifle. That's how you address me? Ah come on with that bullshit. What is that, soldier? This is a bi-pod based Remington M twenty four with a five three mount to twenty four inch heavy barrel. The trigger's been readjusted to a.. Feather touch. Point nine kilogram pull. This rifle holds a three hundred mag shell and has a minimum effective firing range of 300 meters in the motherfucking night. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Jeff, the target is Jimmy Varin, Scout. You serious? That's his file. Checked it out, did my own research. It's true. He's done some fucked up shit, man. You know, shit we saw but it was just the tip of the iceberg. Now... if you're in, there's no turning back. Take your time, do it right. Sure, I can't get you something? I'm all right, thanks. Whoa, whoa, what the fuck? Holy shit. This is above our pay-grade. Hey, we need to get some tech in here to sweep this thing. Congressman. Thanks, Ann. Good afternoon, Mr. Barnes. Hey, close the door. I know the last one was difficult, but it had to happen And I'm assuming that Jeff was careful. No loose ends, nothing that can come back to us? You know what your problem is? What's that? You want to swim without getting your feet wet. Please don't question me about my men, especially the men you asked me to recruit to kill another one of my men. Let him go, Seth. He needs to reconcile with himself. We'll give him a couple of days then we'll reach out. Think maybe we should go to that funeral service. Of course. Let's get Barnes a new phone, put a tracker on it. I want to know where he's at at all times. Done. Hey Ma, why don't you have a drink with me huh? I'll get it for you. You just eat and stop fussing over me, I ain't dead yet. Okay. No problem. - Let's see what we got here. - Mm hmm. This is good. Thank you. Where you find this? That was in my stuff. Probably got it out of one of your boxes or something, I was looking at it. Mm. Jesus. She was about twelve or thirteen years old in this photo. I was hanging up clothes on the line to dry in the backyard, and she was, she was by my side, and then she ran off to go grab a dress that had come loose. I went back in the house to get some more clothespins. And when I got back she was gone. Ma, come on. I know, I know. Hey, I know. I know, Mom. She was gone... When I turned around seemed like she just disappeared. Mom. Right here, mom... I'm right here... I ain't going nowhere... Excuse me. May we have a word with you please? Ahh, of course. I'm FBI Special Agent Reynolds. And this is my partner, Special Agent Kensington. We have a few questions we'd like to ask you if that's all right. Anything I can do to help. This is my wife, Sarah, and my brother, Seth. Do you mind if they stick around or? Not at all, ma'am. It's pleasure to meet you. Likewise. Sir. Were you a friend of the deceased? Ahh well he's one of our nation's veterans, whether active or inactive, I always try to show my support. Did you know Mr. Varin? We spoke, ahh, it was a few years ago. I was a member of the panel that presided over his misconduct case. Well, if you think you might have any information that could help out our investigation please feel free to contact us. Absolutely. Thank you very much. Thank you, congressman. Sir. So sorry to bother you again. I personally wanted to thank you for all the work that you do for our vets. I'm a former service member. No, thank you for your service. Absolutely. All right, good day. Dakota... Yeah, baby? Did you know that man? Behind every smart, successful man, right... Yes. Yes, I knew him.

You two looked at each other like you fucked last night, now she was introducing you to her boyfriend for the first time. What? Where the fuck... do you know her from? Why are you going to AA meetings? I thought we handled that problem with the rehab I paid for. We did, it's the AA's just maintenance. Do we have a problem here? I mean how the fuck.. You're just paranoid. Paranoid? The fucking FBI just showed up to fucking funeral to question me. What do you talk about in these meetings? I don't talk. You go to these meetings and you don't talk? No, I don't talk. Oh fuck. Don't fucking lie to me ever again. So what did you think? There's something there, just not sure what it is yet. Hmm. How do you figure? Why the hell is the Congressman attending this guy's funeral? He hardly even knew him. He's a stand up guy. You're buying that? Yeah, Ambrose has a great record of helping out the vets and their families. I mean he dedicates all these programs, that help get them back into society once they come off tour. I mean why wouldn't he be at this funeral? You're just saying that 'cause you know his brother. Excuse me, who...? Come on, you two know each other. What are you talking about?

Good afternoon Ladies and gentlemen, everyone who's here. Sorry for interrupting the festivities. Unlike most politicians with a podium and, a microphone. I promise I'll keep it brief. First I would just like to thank each and every one of you for coming out and showing your support for a cause that is so dear to my heart. Your generous contributions make it possible for us to expand access to critical medical care and programs that re-instate and retrain our nation's veterans. So on behalf of all service members past, present and future and the entire veterans outreach community, thank you for your continued support, we can't do it without you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Don't forget to tip your bartenders. - That was good, babe. - Yeah. Thanks. Daddy, that was great. Also I think you're a gentlemen. I felt like a silly man. Did I look silly? No. - You sure? - No. Hold on. I got to take this. You fucking bitches, where's my mother? She's safe, we're not animals, we just need you to answer some questions. Do you know who I am? I think you do, so how about you tell me who you are? I think that's fair, don't you? Go fuck yourself. What the fuck is this about? Come on buddy. I'm asking the fucking questions. All of them? I like you, you got balls. Now tell us who hired you to kill Phala in his own restaurant? You know, there's a piece of paper in the side of my jacket, there's a number on it. You take a look at that, give it a call, and while you're at it, you can suck my dick, you fuck in... Let's find out who's behind this. It's good to see you again, Congressman. You got your hands in a lot of things this evening, huh? Where's my guy, Frank? You know who he killed, don't you? Yeah and I don't care. Maybe you don't, but a mutual friend is not too happy about it. How do you think I found him? You could have told us what Phala was up to. We would have taken care of it internally. Let me worry about that. Seth, go get him. What about my development project? The guy you clipped was running point. Now I'm on the hook for half a mil. My family has gotta eat you know. How bad did you rough him up? He's all right. I'll raise the rest of the financing but I then I get thirty percent of the complex. My family's gotta eat too. Hmm.. Twenty-five. Thirty five, it's Section Eight. Thirty percent... You missed your calling, you should be working for us. Set it up with my secretary and get some rest, Frank. You're too old to be roughing people up in the middle of the night. Just watch your step, we all have bosses. Hey, sorry for the mix up, huh? Put a little ice on it, you'll be all right. Ay, ay, ay. Oh, shit. What bosses? Get in the car. All right. Here we go... No, no. No. One, two, three. Mommy, is that a package? Can I help you? Yeah, is Dakota around? Mm hmm. Dakota. Barnes. This is my wife, Sarah. Sarah, this is Sergeant Barnes. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. We're just gonna go out back and just chat for a second, all right. Walk around the back here. My fucking house? Oh, it's not subtle enough for you? I can still make your life miserable if I want to. Remember what you said, about life being a battlefield, you can't control it more than the weather. Well, welcome to the battlefield. What are you doing here? I don't appreciate being left in the dark, especially when it comes to me and my mother being in harm's way. You're right, totally agree, it should have never happened. I'm sorry. Yeah, and if I even think that you're lying to me again, I'm gonna make your life a living fucking hell, you hear me? There's no road map here, we're in uncharted territory. - There's risks... - Yeah... but you're working for somebody that's keeping you safe. It's not that simple. Who is it? A silent partner who has no interest in stepping out from behind the shadows. So that's it, I'm a fucking lure. That's it. I promise I'll keep you safe. Bullshit, you can't keep me safe. We have to navigate carefully here. Ambrose group, why are they wiring money to a company that's renting server space? - The Ambrose group? - Yeah, your family name, it came out when I was squeezing Emory at the server farm. My father. Your father? He's the whole reason I'm doing this. I'm listening. He was a... degenerate gambler, a drunk, real piece of shit. Child pornography was a means of earning money for him. He had a group... of friends, a company, the Ambrose group. He tried to recruit me when I was just a kid, my sister shielded me and she... ...paid the ultimate price. What happened to her? They destroyed her... and threw her away like a piece of trash. Your father? Cancer, he died before I could do it myself. So that's it, I'm here to clean up his fucking mess. He destroyed a lot of lives and a lot of families and it's still going on today. If we don't... Your sister... Diane. You better never, ever say her name again. You hear me? I found photos of her too. She was the same age as my sister when she was abducted, and she suffered the same fate. I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me? Because when I found out what happened to my sister, it didn't make it... better, it made it worse. So who's your friend? Ah, just an associate at work. He looked like he wanted to kill you. I'm going to go in the other room. All right okay, I'm in the initial stages of a new project at the outreach office, it was some trouble and we needed to... Okay, what kind of trouble? Like staffing trouble. Dakota, how long do you expect me to play the dumb housewife? You're interrogated by the FBI a few days ago and now there's a man coming to our door with... like a busted up face. What happened to his face? All right maybe I'm working outside the lines a little bit here - but it's to effect real change - Daddy... - Hold on sweetie. - Can you come and help me? We're fine, look we're fine, there's nothing to worry about. Okay it's not "we" that I'm worried about. You know I'd never do anything to put us in harm's way, you know that. Okay? I love you. Daddy. All right, I'm coming, sweetie. Hey who are these little ones. - That's Jenny. - Jenny... And this is daddy... - Oh that's me. - Yeah. I'm sorry D. I know it's been a while, I should have been here sooner but... I guess I was afraid. Now I know that you just didn't run away, baby, you were taken... and I'll get the people that did that to you. Yeah, I promise. I have two names for you. Gordon Pasternak and Bruno Argenta. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm Virginia, Dakota's silent partner. These men were my husband's associates and they are the reason we are here today. How did you know that I was here? We have a tracker on your phone. You should be proud of her. She was very strong. She tried to end their little game. She almost succeeded. She stabbed Pasternak. But... they ended her life. How do I know you're telling me the truth? You're not just using me to clean up your mess? My husband was a horrible human being. Even though I never knew his victims, I feel a debt owed to those who survived. These men are the head of the snake, the ring leaders of the underground child porn syndicate on the East Coast. Remember this isn't Revenge, Sergeant Barnes. It's more than that. It's justice. They will not be easy targets. They're guarded and protected. Virginia. Thank you. Hi, my name is Seth, and I'm an alcoholic. - Hi Seth. - Hi Seth. Um, it's been a while right? I feel like I'm ashamed I'm even here. Like I should... have this thing beat somehow... like everything in my life should be fine and I should be able to function in the world like all the normal people in the outside world out there. And then I remember that I... do have a problem and all the time I spend... distancing myself from it just... makes me feel like I'm less. Um, part of me is so used to beating myself up that... I forget that... I do have options. But coming here helps, so thank you for that and thank you for letting me share. Thank you Seth. Thank you. Anyone else? I'm Dani, I'm an alcoholic. - Hi Dani. - Hi Dani. Ooh I'm struggling today guys, I'm struggling... I'm struggling with a secret. We all know how we're only as sick as our secrets, right? So I'm here to tell on myself. I'm in a place in my life where I'm trying to reconcile my professional life and my personal life, and I'm just having a really tough time bridging the gap that I just, it's so frustrating you know. And I'm trying so hard not to beat myself up and, you know come down on myself and be mad that I'm not showing up for myself. Because we all know it's about progress not perfection, right? But it is so hard, that I just think for a nanosecond just one drink, just one. Why, why can't I have one? Why can't I be normal like everybody else? But I can't have one. It's a disease inside of me and I just have to remember that. I'm real sorry. I just needed to share and get this... ugly secret out. So thank you for letting me share, you guys. - Thank you Dani. - Thank you. Hey. Hey. You know you can still talk to me. Thanks... and it's a bit fucking awkward though, isn't it? You did good in your share tonight. Thank you, it's been a while. You too, it really helped. Good... you know, questioning your brother was a formality, right? We questioned everybody at the cemetery that day. Should you really be talking to me about an ongoing investigation? No. - Hey. - Yeah. Hey. I called you, - you didn't pick up. - You did? I turn my phone off during meetings. Hey what did you call me for? Dani. Barnes. You guys are friends? Yeah, this is Barnes... - I'm sorry. We got to go. - We go way back. Okay, next week. I'll see you next week. - All right. - Okay. Catch you next week. Long Island City, Queens. The child pornography ring is run out of the back office in the warehouse. Now the place is like a fucking fortress, they got men at the doors, the corridors, and the inner sanctum. Now they got a house out in Montauk where they shoot these films but this, this is their distribution hub. Let me see. Yeah it's a two man job. Fucking disgusting. I got Jeff, he's ready and willing. Do me a favor and make examples of them. No, no, we're not going to be making examples out of anyone. Listen, I want it brutal, I want it ugly, I want it painful. Look, regardless, two men are gonna be dead, but it's gonna raise a lot more red flags if we make more of it than we need to. So like I said, we do it quickly and we do it quietly. - You keep saying, "we." - Yeah, I want to be in on this one. - They could kill you. - You don't think I know that... I'm there... I'm ready. Big bad-ass criminal mastermind, look at you. Ready to step out from behind the curtain, huh? Mm hmm. You ever held a gun? No. We're not criminals, we're sanitation workers taking out the trash. I'm a criminal, remember? Rip their fucking hearts out for me. - Gordo. - Yeah. I'm having an issue with the credit card processor coming through our tri server. - Well can you fix it? - I'm trying. Which film? How many downloads we talking about? Give me a figure over here. Wait, hold on. Message board is popping up. People are getting charged for extra videos, and they're not getting any playback. All right contact the buyers and tell them we're working on it. Okay I'm on it. All right. Hey. Maybe you should stay in the car. I'm fucking here... and nobody's telling me what the fuck to do anymore. Okay. Okay. Remember what I told you, keep two hands on that bitch, all right? Stay close, stay tight, remember slow is fast, fast is dead. We'll do our best to keep you safe. Protect yourself at all times, you got it? I got it. Okay. I got it. All right. Just don't point that thing at me. What the fuck was that! Jeff!? Jeff. Stay tight, stay close. Don't move. You two, get up, now! Against the wall. What the fuck is this? This is for killing my sister. And walking around in the world like she doesn't matter. We got money, we got money, take it all! Fuck you. And his sister too. Come on, pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey! Is Jenny with you? Is everything all right? Where are you? We're home, she's right here. What's going on with you? Dakota? I got another call coming in, I gotta go. I'll be home in a bit. I just got take out. Love you. Hello? Your daughter is safe but you already know that. Do I have your attention? What do you want? Always so tense, you should smile more. You're much more charming when you smile. You touch her, I swear to fucking God. I would never touch the Governor's daughter. Governor? Yes, Governor Ambrose. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Just dangling at the tip of my fingers. You can't just run around sanctioning evil, Mr. Ambrose. That blank check I gave you for your little adventures came at a price. I think you should come see me. Coming right now. Fuck. Yeah. I need you to come meet me it's important. I'll text you the address. Got it. Where you going now? Gotta go, Ma. Vitamin C. Mm Hmm. Dakota... I did some thinking. I'm more comfortable with twenty percent on our deal. She's waiting for you. No hard feelings huh? This is the first building I ever purchased. When I found it I knew the property value was in the gutter, but even then I could tell it was worth something. You see gentlemen, I have a knack for recognizing value. You for instance. When I found you toiling as a clerk in the halls of Congress, you were useless, And now you're a powerful Congressman, future Governor. In that way you remind me of my late husband. And like him you have a weakness, which brings us to you. The recovering drunk, a liability you should've paid more attention to. But you did serve your purpose. Because of you, I have a rather shocking video ...of an American politician's brother directly involved in the ruthless murder ...of a helpless man. Ordered and sanctioned by so said politician. Your "AA Buddy" ...my niece "Dani", happens to be very handy with a smart phone. Now, Mr. Ambrose. Can you guess what's in my pocket? No. You are. As you climb the ladder, you'll come to realize that the rent is paid in favors. And now, most importantly, you, Sergeant Barnes, a true hero. I think I speak for myself and the future Governor Ambrose when I thank you for clearing our name. The politician wouldn't have a future if it wasn't for you. I'd say we're indebted, but I think Ambrose already knows that. Now, if you all want to stay out of prison and above ground, then I'm your only option. The way I see it... you'll be doing my bidding from here on out. Gentlemen. Can we talk? I feel like there's a lot to talk about after that, right? Congressional recess is over, Seth. I got to get back to the Capitol. Hey, I'll reach out soon, stay out of trouble. Trouble won't find me. I know that's right. Hey Barnes. Yeah. You free tomorrow? Of course. Why don't you come down to DC with me. We got a lot of work to do. DC it is.
